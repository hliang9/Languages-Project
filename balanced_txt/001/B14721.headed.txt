¶ To the right honourable Sir Walter Mildmay knyghte, Chancellour of the Queenes Maiesties court of Eschequer, and one of hir highnesse moste honourable priuie counsel, Arthur Gol∣ding wisheth abundance of Christs grace, healthe, prosperitie, and increace of honour. SO great always hathe Gods louyng kyndenesse and care bin ouer his beloued Church: that besides the vvashing and clē∣syng thereof in the fountaine of regene∣ration, thorough the most precious bloud∣shed of his onely be∣gotten and deare be∣loued sonne, and the reconciling of vs too him selfe by his death, vvhen vve vvere yet his vtter enimies and the children of endlesse vvrathe and damnation by oure naturall birthe from our firste father Adam: hee hath not only giuen vs the spirite of adoption, vvher∣by vve assuredly feele, and freely and boldly protest him too bee oure Father: but also clothed vs vvith Christes rightuousnesse, vvherthrough vve rising vp to nevvnesse and holines of life, do get the vpper hande
of sinne, death and Satan, by mortifying the old Adam vvith the lusts and likings therof through liuely faith, driuen avvay the mist of ignorance and misbeleef from our mindes by the lyght of his gracious Gospell, that vve myght vvalke vvithout stumbling as in the open daylight: and finally taughte vs all thyngs necessarie as vvell to the atteynment of the immortalitie to come, as to the leading of a godlie, quiet and happie lyfe heere, by exercising the dueties of mutuall loue and charitie among our selues: but also (lest any thing might vvant to the strengthning and incouraging of vs to goe tho∣rough, and to hold out cōstantly to the end of our race) hath armed vs ageinst all temptations, hart bytings and stumblingblocks, by vvarning vs aforehād vvhat thin∣ges should happen to his Churche from tyme to tyme too the ende of the vvorlde, vvhat revvardes are layd vp in heauen for the godly, and vvhat punishementes shall finally fall vppon the vvicked. For he knovving both the vvilinesse of the olde serpent raging and ram∣ping lyke a hungerstaruen Lyon disappoynted of his pray, and the spitefull malice of the vvorld vvhiche be∣ing sette altogither vppon naughtinesse fyghteth conti∣nually vvith tooth and nayle ageinst the truth and the professers therof: and thervnto hovv fraile and vveake vvee be of ourselues, insomuch that although there be a vvillingnesse in vs to persist in his seruice through the vvorking of his holie spirite, yet vve fynde no povver and abilitie to performe that desire, furtherfoorth than vve be vphilde and maynteyned by his mightie hande from aboue: He (I say) knovving all these things vvel ynough, hath alvvayes like a most prouident houshol∣der
and foreseeing vvatcheman, foretold his seruaunts of the inconueniences to come, that they mighte not be so astonished or amazed vvith the suddaynnesse or gre∣uousnesse of them, as to quayle or shrinke at any perill, persecution, or misfortune, but alvvays comfort them selues vvith the certaintie of Gods prouidence and assu∣rance of his helpe. This did he vvhen he told Abraham that his seede shoulde be a soiourner in a strange lande, vvhere they should be brought in bondage, and misin∣treated. 400. yeares. This didde hee vvhen hee tolde the people of Iuda and Ierusalem that they shoulde bee caried avvaye too Babylon, and there serue the Chaldeis. 70. yeares. This did he vvhen by the mouth of his chozen vessell Saint Paule he tolde the ministers and elders of the Churche of Ephesus that greeuous vvolues and speakers of levvde things should rise vp, vvhiche should not spare the flocke. Finally, this hath he done through all ages and all times bothe vnder the lavve and vnder the Gospell, as vvell in the olde Te∣stament as in the nevve: and specially in this presente Reuelation to his holie seruant Saincte Iohn, vvhiche according to the name thereof, conteyneth a mysticall discouerie of the vvholestate of the Church, from the first setting foorth ad preaching of the Gospell, euen vnto the ende of the vvorlde. VVhiche thing surely is so muche the more needefull, bicause that mannes na∣ture grovving dayly more and more into decay vvith the perishing vvorlde novve hasting too his ende, is more subiecte too corruption, and lesse gyuen too Godlynesse and vertue than euer it vvas: and the di∣uell perceyuing his kingdome vppon earth to dravve
apace too vtter ruine, laboureth the more earnestly to vvorke all the spight and mischief he can to Christ and his members. And therefore Christe oure Pro∣phet, high Priest and King, being not ignorant of the perillousnesse of these latter days, vvherin the fury of Antichryst shoulde rage farre extremelyer than euer it had doone since the first creation of things: not onely forevvarneth, but also armeth vs in this booke, that vve mighte haue continuall comforte and patience by his Scriptures. Novv although the Commentaries of that learned and godlie father doctour Bullinger opening and expounding these mysticall reuelations, haue here∣tofore bin translated, and be alredy stil extant in our en∣glish tung: in respect vvherof it might seeme that this labor of myne might the better haue bin spared in that behalf: yetnotvvithstanding forasmuch as Gods spirit the fountaine of all knovvledge and vnderstanding, sheadeth himself into vvhome hee vvill, and in vvhat maner and measure he vvill, and vseth the sundrie dis∣positions of mens vvittes diuersly too the furtherance of Chrystes kingdome, and the aduancement of Gods glorie: I doubt not but that this vvorke vvill be found to be both profitable and necessarie, to such as reade it vvith a christianly mynde of beeing edifyed to saluati∣on and not vvith a curious fansie of seeking straunge and vncouth things. For the vvord of God serueth too feede mens soules vnto eternall lyfe, and not to delight their eares vvith transitorie pleasantnesse. And maister Marlorat that peinful labourer in Gods vineyard, vvho in the end sealed vp the testimony of Iesus Christ vvith the expence of his ovvne bloud, hath briefly conueyed
into this his vvorke, the vvhole substaunce of matter, vvhich all the late vvriters of our times haue set dovvn in vvriting for the better opening of this present Reue∣lation. And vvhere as hee to auoyde tediousnesse, and to bring his booke into the lesse rome, had referred the reader to other places of his former expositions vppon other partes of the Scripture: I to ease the reader of his labour in seeking them vvhere they be translated, and to supply his vvant of them vvhere they be not tran∣slated, haue sought oute those places, & from thence conueyed bothe his matter and vvordes into this tran∣slation, and set them in their proper roomes, as largely or briefly as the presente purpose seemed to require, Novve therefore it may please your honour of youre accustomed goodnesse tovvardes mee, or rather of youre loue to the setting foorthe of Gods glorie (vvhi∣che is vvell knovvne to be moste earnest and vnfained) too accept this trauell of myne, vvhich being dedicated to your name, is set foorth to the stablishment of Chri∣stes kingdom and common vvealth in this realme; and to the speciall comforte of suche as are vnder the crosse, and fynde not any succour or reliefe at the handes of men. Finished at my lodging in London the last day of August. 1574.

¶ A Catholike and Eccle∣siasticall Exposition vpon the Apocalips of S. John the apostle. The Argument. ALthoughe many haue douted héertofore of the au∣thoritie and certayntie of this Booke, yea and many haue very stiffly reiected it: yet notwithstanding forsa∣much as whatsoeuer is con∣teyned in it, dothe greately profit to the edifying & fur∣therāce of Christes church, and hathe bene admitted by most of the aunciēt fathers with cōmon consent: it wer nowe no reason to call in question the truthe and authoritie therof by any means. Howbeit, euen at this day the expoun∣ders of the holie scriptures are scarsly agréed of the author or rather of the writer of it. All of them doe graunt in déed, (which thing also the text it selfe dothe manifestly auouche) that he was called Iohn, whosoeuer he was, that was the wryter of this Reuelation. But forasmuche as many men, and those not of the meanest sort, euen in the tyme of the A∣postles, did beare the name of Iohn: it is doubted among lerned men euen at this day, who this Iohn should be. They that denie him to haue bin the Apostle and Euangeliste, al∣though they be moued by likely coniectures: yet are not their coniectures of sufficient force to proue that whiche they goe about. But to omit their reasons whiche are washed away
nowe long agoe by menne of singular learning: we must assure our selues, that the coniecture of them is more proba∣ble, whiche haue fathered this holie Booke replenished with incredible comfort, eyther vpon Iohn the Apostle, or vppon Marke, who also was surnamed Iohn. Moreouer the thin∣ges, that are sette foorth in this prophecie darkly, and in ma∣ner riddlelyke, muste not hinder the godlie from readyng of it. For Iohn doth therefore vse figures, bicause the thing that he writeth is a Reuelation, which it pleaseth God to disclose vnto him vnder suche manner of figures: which thing euen the Prophets dyd: wherevpon also all this booke is called a Prophecie, Chap. 1. verse. 3. &. 22. b. 7. d. 18.19. Besides this, it was muche more wisdome to foretell the destruction of the Romane Empire (which at that time bare sway almost ouer the whole worlde) vnder the couerts of figures, than in open speeche, least the Romane Princes should rage more cruelly agaynst the Christians euen in that respecte: and yet for all that, the godly mindes were to be quickened and comforted by this prophesie, agaynst their most cruell persecutions. So Paule. 2. Thessal. 2.7.8. &c. chose rather to poynt out the hor∣rible fall of the Romishe Antichrist couertly, than by playne words. Notwithstanding, this booke shall be simple, playne, and cleare to the faythfull, so they reade it aduisedly and re∣uerently. I confesse in déede that the auncient Interpreters haue oftentimes béene graueled in the expounding of it, and that they coulde not alwayes winde them selues out: but yet it is well knowne by the way, that euen they themselues haue more than once sayde, howe this booke should scarse be able to bée vnderstoode, vntill it were fulfilled: and that then it should bée easie to bée vnderstoode of euery man without trouble. Likewyse to the Fathers of olde tyme, Daniel vision séemed moste darkesome, but when the things wer come to passe whiche he had couered vnder figures: there were some that sayde he had written a Storie of thyngs past, and not a prophecie of things to come. So when wée
shall haue read this booke of Reuelation aduisedly and di∣ligentlye, and haue compared the thynges whiche it spea∣keth vnder couerte, with those things that stories do wit∣nesse to bée doone: wée shall saye, that euen this Booke also vttereth mere Histories. For it declareth (althoughe vnder figures, yet more euidentlye than the Propets) what is the state of Christes kingdome, what is the lotte of the Churche, and to what persecutions they bée subiecte, as manie as are earnestly bente to the Christian Religion. Furthermore it peynteth out vnto vs a description of the di∣uell, and of all his malice and mischiefe, and setteth before our eyes the dreadfull torments of hell and damnation. Also it openeth Heauen vnto vs, and sheweth moste euidently what is the true hope of the faithful. Againe, it auoucheth the true resurrection of all fleshe: Finally it sheweth (and that moste plenteously, what shall be the ende at length bothe of the chosen, and the reprobates, and of the faithful and the vn∣faithfull, what is the soueraine goodnesse, and what is the vt∣termoste miserie and vnhappinesse: so as this booke (euen for the verie matter that it treateth of, and teacheth) commen∣deth it selfe too all the Godlie, shewyng (yea and euen prouyng) it selfe too bée wrytten by the indytyng of the holye Ghoste. In manye respectes therefore is it woorthye too bée redde wyth all diligence, and to be thoroughly weyed of all learned menne: specially in these laste and most pe∣rillous tymes, the whiche thys prophesie concerneth. For if (as méete is) wée bée willyng too bryng wyth vs the re∣uerende mynde and desiriousnesse to learne, which of right is due to the reading of the holy Scriptures, no man can ea∣sily expresse how much profit wyll redounde vnto vs by this prophesie. Neyther néede wée too passe for the brabbling out∣cries of our aduersaries, who when they héere vs call the bi∣shop of Rome Antichriste, yell oute as if they were burned with a searingyron. But forasmuch as the ouerthwartnesse of the popish doctrine, and the corrupt manners of the whole
Popishe clergie, crie out that there is none other chiefe An∣tichrist to come, than he that is come alreadie in the Romi Bishops, to be killed in the meane time by the sword of gods worde in the heartes of the faithfull, and within a whyle af∣ter, to be quite abolished by the glorious comming of Christ vnto iudgement: if we shoulde suppresse and conceale thys thing, the verie stones would crye out at it. ¶ The first Chapter. THe Reuelation of Iesu Christe, vvhiche God gaue vnto him, to open vnto his seruauntes the things that must shortly come to passe, & [vvhiche] he betokened vvhen he sent the message by his Angell vn∣to his seruant Iohn. THe reuelation of Iesu Christ. A. The fyrst verse of this prophecie, béeing as it were the title of the booke,The title of this booke. sheweth briefly the kinde of doctrine that is treated of in it: and also by whose ministerie the frute of this doctrine is come vnto the whole Churche. As touching the fyrst woord, the olde interpreter hath in this place left the Gréeke woord, the which notwithstanding hée translated oftentimes afore.Apocalypsis or Reuelation E. The worde is Apocalyps, whi∣che many of the old writers haue thought to haue bin deui∣sed by the thréescore and twelue Interpreters, to expresse the proprietie of the Hebrue spéeche withall. For the Hebrewes call it Nalab,Nalab. when a thing is discouered that was hidden be∣fore. A. Lyke as when it is sayd in the Prophet, The Lorde God dooth not any thing, but he reuealeth the secrete therof to his seruants the prophets, Amos. 3. b. 7. And again, Deale with thy neyghbour thy selfe,The maner of the He∣brues in enti∣tuling theyr bookes. and discouer not thy secrete to an other mā, Prouer. 25. b. 8. E. Forasmuch then as many my∣steries which were hidden héeretoofore are disclosed and ope∣ned in this booke: the author of this work folowing the ma∣ner
of the Hebrues, hath begonne his booke with the title of it. S. G. And this Reuelation is a Propheticall séeing of thin∣ges to come, yea and of things hidden, whiche are certainly knowne to God alone, and to whome it pleaseth him to re∣uele them. A. Moreouer this booke consisteth wholly of sun∣drie visions, whervnto is added the worde,Wherof this booke consi∣steth. to the intent the prophesies may be of the more authoritie. We knowe that Visions were one of the ordinarie means wherby God was wont to manyfest himselfe in olde time too his prophetes,Visions. ac∣cording as we read in Moyses: If there be a prophet among you, to him will I the Lorde appeare in vision, and speake with him in dreames. Nu. 12. b. 6. Of both of them we haue an example in the Patriarke Abraham, Gen. 15. c. 12.Dreames. Nowe although these two kyndes of reuealing haue ben very rare since the tyme that Christ was reueled, bicause all the god∣lie must content themselues with the only Gospell of Gods sonne: yet notwithstanding, it pleased God to discouer cer∣tayne things to his seruantes after this maner at the fyrste springing vp of the Gospell: of whiche thyng we may now atteyne manifest knowledge by his worde. B. For the cōmon effect of all visions is, that God may by him reuele his will vnto others, or else giue men occasion to searche out his will by them. And God applieth himselfe not a little vnto our af∣fections, in calling eche of vs by suche meanes as we be ea∣silyest moued withall. As for example, he called the Wyze men by a strange starre. Math. 2. b. 9. The Iewes by the au∣thoritie of Scriptures, the Gentiles by the wonderfulnesse of Miracles, and Cornelius the Centurion by sendyng an Angell vnto him. Act. 10. a. 3. Lykewise Paule was warned by a vision in the night, that he should passe out of Asia into Macedonia. Act. 16.9. E.God calleth men by suche meanes as they be beste acquainted withall. Therfore like as the worde and mi∣racles doe teache men and admonishe them of Gods will, so also doe visions. And although no suche visions appéere too men now adayes: yet will eche mans owne faythe, & Gods spirit in him teach him (yea though he be called by mē) whe∣ther
he be called of God or no, & whether his vocation please God or no.Boasting of of false reue∣lations. B. No doubt also but that the false Apostles haue bin wont to boast of the Reuelations that haue bin made pe∣culiarly vnto them (as the deceyuers of our dayes are like∣wise commonly wont to do.) Which thing causeth Paule. 2. Cor. 12. a. 1.2. to glory of the Reuelations that had bin shewed vnto him of a very troth, and not deceitfully: S. least he might séeme inferior to the false Apostles in that behalfe. B. For we know it was an ordinarie matter for God to reueale and dis∣couer himselfe by peculiar Reuelations to the better sorte of men whome he had apointed to the greatest matters. So reade we that the Lorde appéered to Abraham, Moses, Esai, Ezechiell, and the rest of the Prophets, and specially to the thrée disciples on the Mount, whome the Lorde had chosen out for the same purpose,The differēce betwene visi∣ons and reue∣lations. Math. 17. a. 5. C. Finally, betwéene visions and reuelations, there is this difference: That a Re∣uelation happeneth oftentimes eyther by dreame, or by an∣swer, wherin nothing appéereth to the eye: But a vision is in maner neuer giuen but with a Reuelation, that is to say, but that the Lord discloseth what his meaning is by it. Ther∣fore although the Lorde God could by his playne word haue taught his seruant Iohn what he had listed: yet was it hys pleasure to do it by certain visions agreable to the greatnesse of the matter, for the common profyt of all his seruants. Of Iesus Christ. S. Héere is shewed the Author of the Reuelation: namely euen he that only knoweth the father aright,The author of this work. and in whome are layd vp all the treasures of wisedome and know∣ledge, Coloss. 2. a. 3. Afterward there is added, which God gaue him. S. For asmuch as Christ is appointed to be the mediator betwene God and men: it must not séeme strange though he thinke himselfe beholden to God for al things which he hath by taking mans flesh vpon him: according as it is to be séene euery where in the Gospell of Iohn.The digniie of this work. Whereby also is to be marked the distinction of persons. P. Heere also is the authori∣tie of this prophecie commended, in that it is properly fathe∣red,
not vppon man but vppon God, A. howbeit that the knowledge thereof is come vntoo vs by Chryste who is made manne. For thys is he of whose fulnesse all of vs haue receyued, Iohan. 1. b. 16.The intent of this worke. who also is gyuen vnto vs of God, to be the onely mayster and teacher of the Churche, Math. 17. a. S. To open vnto hys seruauntes. I. That is to saye, to shewe or declare vnto hys seruauntes: and it is referred to the thynges following, to the ende that by thys Reuelati∣on Iesus, he myght shew or point out vnto his seruauntes, what was to come anone after. There bée that suppose the latin translater to haue written it Planum facere, whiche is too make playne, in sted of Explanare, whyche is to interpret, expounde, or tell what is to come: whiche agréeth well to darke matters. For although Palam facere be a good latin phrase, béeing taken to publish, to blaze abroade, or to make a thing open: yet is it not voyde of double méening, in as muche as he dothe a thing openly whyche doth it in the face of the worlde. M. But the playne méening of thys place is, that GOD hathe disclosed these thynges to hys sonne Chryst, not to the ende that he shoulde shut them vp agayne in hymselfe: but to the ende he shoulde also shewe them foorthe too the godlye,The office of the second per¦son in Trini∣tie. that the whole Churche myghte fare the better by them. A. And truely we knowe it to be Chrystes office, to open vnto the faythfull, the thynges that hée hathe receyued of hys father: whyche thyng also hée auoucheth hymselfe to haue perfourmed diligent∣ly, Iohn. 15. c. 15. The thynges that must shortly come to passe.The certan∣tie of Gods ordinance, and euerlasting prouidence. Iohn (according as other Prophetes also do) mencioneth certayne thynges that perteyne to the former tymes, cer∣tayne that perteyne to hys owne tyme, and certayne that perteyne to the tymes to come: (whych thyng now and then will be hard to discerne: whereof I report me to so variable expositions of them) but he maketh mention bothe of the thynges past, and of the thynges present, in consideration of the thyngs to come. A. Whereas he sayth that these thynges
must come to passe, he doeth vs to vnderstande howe greate the stablenesse and assurednesse of Gods determination is. S. For looke what things are foreappoynted by Gods deter∣minate purpose, they are vtterly vnchaungeable. For I am God (sayth he) and am not chaunged Malach. 3. b. 6. Also, A. my determination shall stande, and all my will shall come too passe, Esai. 46. d. 10. And Chryst confirmeth the same in these wordes, heauen and earthe shall passe, but my worde shall not passe, Math. 24. c. 35. Luke 21. f. 33. A. As ofte then as we sée the intercourses of things and sundrie alterati∣ons of kyngdomes: lette vs lift vp our eyes vnto Gods pro∣uidence, whereby the thing that hée hathe foreordeyned by his singular wysedome, are guyded to their end. The world∣lings surmyse all thyngs to be doone by Fortune,Fortune. bycause they are not priuie too the reason why moste of them bée doone. But the Godlie consyder Gods iuste iudgemente, and reuerently confesse, that the onely one God who is sin∣gularly good, is bothe the moste wyse maker, and also the moste vpright gouerner of the whole worlde. S. The woorde shortly,Shortly. séemeth to be added for the comfort of the godlie, and also for the terror of the wicked: A. that like as there is large reward layde vp for all the godlie in heauen: S. euen so Gods vengeance is in a redinesse for the reprobates:Speedie pu∣nishment of the reprobates according as is sayd: whose iudgement is not far off, and their damnaton sléepeth not, 2. Pet. 2. a. 3. For like as he slepeth not which as∣saulteth vs, A. but goth about seeking whom he may deuour. 1. Pet. 5. c. 8. euē so slepeth not he nother yt kepeth Israel. Psa. 121. a. 4. S. Whervpon Christ sayd: Shal not God auēge his elect which crie night and day vnto him, though he suffer for a whyle? I say vnto you, he wil auenge them, and that short∣ly. Luk. 18. b. 7. For when the vngodly shal saye, Peace, and all is safe: then commeth sodaine destruction vpon them, as throwes vpon a woman that trauaileth with chylde, and they shall not escape.Pacient aby∣ding of Gods leysure. 1. Thess. 5. a. 3. Yet must not we be ha∣stie to aske vengeance vpon the vngodly: but we moste pa∣ciently
abyde till tyme conuenient come. Therefore if the long continuance of afflictions, and the long taryance of the righteous iudge, prouoke vs to impaciencie, or thruste any douting of Gods promise into vs, as though Gods promising to come quickly were in vayne: let vs beare in mynde that the length or shortnesse of tyme must not be measured in any wyse by our own reason. For with the Lord,What ye scrip∣ture meaneth by shortli, spe∣dily, hastly, quickly, or a∣pace. one day is as a thousand yéeres, & a thousād yeres are but as one day, 2. Pe. 3. b. 8. A. Héere therfore is betokened all that tyme that conti∣nueth from Christes comming in the fleshe, vnto the ende of the worlde. For it is both the last houre 1. Iohn. 2. c. 18. and al∣so the end of all things is at hande. 1. Pet. 4. b. 7.Why things be wrapped vp in figures. And whiche he betokened. S. That is to saye, he disclosed all these things howebeit wrapped in mysticall figures, and ouershadowed with images: to the intent the studious sort myght not sette lyght by them, nor Gods holy tokens be discouered to the vn∣worthie: according to this text, Vnto you it is giuen to know the secretes of the kingdome of God, but vnto them it is not giuen. Mat. 13. b. 11. Also, vnto him that knocketh, it shall be opened, ibidem. 7. b. 8. VVhen he had sente the message .B.Who this Angell was. Or ha∣uing sent the message (for else when he sent the Angel, what was it that he sent by the Angell?) or else giuing comman∣dement by his Angell. A. There be whiche thinke, that by this Angell was mente Christ: but more rightly doe others vnderstande him to haue bene some one of those heauenlye spirites, that are called ministring spirites, and are sente a∣broade aboute seruices, for their sakes that shall be heires of saluation, Hebr. 1. d. 14. S. For by this meane is Christe pro∣ued too bée Lord of ye Angels, as by whose seruice in the won∣derfull administration of his kingdome, he both deliuereth the godly out of the hands of the vngodly, and also punisheth the wicked from time too time. A. Besides this, we shal sée this Angell, more than once refuse the worship that Iohn was a∣bout too yeld vnto him, in this present booke. 19. b. 10. & 22. b. 9. which thing Christ would not haue done, in as much as he
is farre more excellent, not onely than men, but also than all the Angels.Gods good∣nesse in fore-warning of his Churche. Vnto his seruant Iohn. S. After this maner is Go of his mercifulnesse wont too vse foreordeined witnesses fa∣miliarly, too the intent too prouide by a fewe, for the welfare of many. So prouided he, first by Noe, then by Abraham, af∣terward by Moses, and at length by a fewe fishermen: and so prouideth he héere by Iohn, for the Churches of Asia, or ra∣ther for the whole world. 2. VVhich bare vvitnesse of the vvord of God, and of the vvitnessing of Iesus Christ, and of all things that he savve. The authori∣tie of thys worke.VVhich bare witnesse of the word of God. A. Least any than might thinke that the things whiche are conteyned in this booke, bée but mans dreames: or take them for fonde fables: the authoritie of the writer is commended in this respecte, that he declareth Gods word in the Church, being called to that charge by God. E. For too beare witnesse is taken héere too publishe openly,To witnesse. A. which word Luke vseth oftentimes in the Acts. 2. f. 40. &. 8. e. 25. &. 20. d. 21. &. 26. e. 22. And Paule al∣so. 1. Thes. 2. b. 10. &. 2. Thes. 1.10. And of the witnessing of Iesus Christ.A description of the gospell, and what is ment by wit∣nessing. It is a description of the Gospel, which is called a testi∣monie of Christ or concerning Christ, bicause the effecte of it tendeth to open or too manifest Christ vnto vs. M. And ther∣fore when Christ sent his Apostles abrode too preache him, he commaunded them too beare witnesse of him in Iewrie, Sa∣maria, and vnto the vttermost boundes of the earth. Other∣some take the witnessing of Christ too concerne his death: and that perchaunce is by reason of Paules wordes, who sayth that Christ witnessed a faire witnessing vnder Pontius Pi∣late. 1. Tim. 6. c. 13. And also we finde written in Iohn that Christ himself said vnto Pilate, To this ende was I borne, and too this purpose am I come into the worlde, that I may beare witnesse too the truth. Iohn. 18. g. 37. Finally the death which the godly do suffer for mainteining the true Religion,
is commonly called a martirdom, that is to say a witnessing. nd of all things that he sawe, M.Seeing and seears. The worde sawe must be re∣erred too the visions which this booke conteyneth. For so doo he Prophets vse it euery where. And herevpon they were alled Seears. 1. Sam. 9. b. 9.11. 3. Blessed is he that readeth and heareth the vvordes f this prophesie, and keepeth the things that are vvrit∣en therin, for the time is at hand. Blessed is he that readeth and heereth. E.The excellen∣cie of this pro¦phecie. In gréeke the num∣er is shifted: blessed is he that readeth, and they that heere he words of the prophesie. For the word This (which is read n the olde translation) is added by some man of his owne ead: peraduenture of purpose too expresse the force of the Gréeke article. A.The profite yt commeth of the reading of holy things. Againe he sheweth the excellencie of this rophesie, auouching that man too bée happie which occupi∣th himselfe in the reading and marking of it, S. that is too it, by beleuing the things that he readeth and heareth. A. In is place we be put in mind of the profit that cōmeth by rea∣ing of holy things. For what can a mā find in worldly wri∣ers too warrant himselfe saluation by? In déede they seeme o write many things that may after a sorte allure men to iue well and blessedly: howebeit for as muche as their dis∣uting of vertue, is voyde of the holye Ghost: they scarsely ttaine too the shadowe of it. But the holye men of God eale farre otherwise, for by the motion of the holy Ghost, they haue reuerentlye and diligentlye lefte in writing too osteritie, the things that make too the glorie of God alone. nd too the full and perfecte felicitie of man, that the lawfull eruice of God might alwayes florishe in the Churche accor∣ing as Paule witnesseth, saying: All scripture inspired by God, is profitable too teaching, too reprouing, too correcting, nd too instructing in rightuousnesse, that the man of God maye bée sound and prepared vnto all good workes. 2. Tim. . d. 16. And in another place hée teacheth that the faithfull
receiue hope by pacience and comfort of the scriptures.Ciuill lear∣ning how far too be vsed. Ro. 15. a. 4. which thing we speake not for that it is hurtful too be∣stowe some labour in ciuill learning, (for euen that also hath his profitablenesse, and openeth the way for thē that mount vnto higher things) but bicause that too forbeare the reading of holy scriptures, & to spende a mans whole time in world∣ly writers, it is not only néedlesse, but also bringeth much in∣conuenience too Christian religion, as it is easie to perceiue by dayly examples. Wherof not vnworthyly doth Paule cō∣mend his sonne Timothie in this respecte, that he was ac∣quainted with holy scripture euen from his childhood, which was able too make him learned vnto saluation through the faith that is in Iesus Christ. 2. Tim. 3. d. 15. Nowe too the in∣tent that the reading of holy scripture may be too our profite:How to reade holy scripture. wée must apply our selues too it not onely thankfully and re∣uerently, but also with great sobernesse and pure affection, ioyning prayer thervnto also. For God reuealeth his miste∣ries out of heauen: Daniel. 2. e. 18. A. He giueth vnderstan∣ding to the little ones. Psal. 119.130. According also as Christ teacheth. Math. 11. d. 25. Notwithstanding forasmuch as it is not giuen to all menne to reade holie writ: there is expresse mention made of hearing, whiche ingendreth faith by the ef∣fectuall working of the holie Ghoste, in mens heartes. For faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Rom. 10.What is mēt by keeping of Gods word. c. 17. And keepeth the things that are written therein. In these wordes are required faith and perseuerance. G. For the kéeping of the word is nothing else but the effectuall re∣ceiuing of it, when it taketh liuely rootes in our hartes, that it may bring forth fruite in his dew time. Otherwise the sin∣gle héering of the worde, is vtterly too no purpose: according as Christ teacheth, Math. 7. d. 26. &. 11. d. 24. & Iames. 1. d. 23. By the way it is too be marked,he outward hing of ord. that héere is commended the outward preaching of the word: least any man bragging him selfe too bée contented with the secret inspiration, and vnder colour therof despising the ministerie of Gods worde, myght
sooth himself in vaine, and for his disdaining of God, he wor∣thily shut out of Gods kingdome. Also it is too be marked, that the hearing or reading of this booke is not ynough: but it must be fulfilled in worke and diligently kept, according as I saide a little afore. They therfore that frame their life ac∣ording too this booke, are happie: for they both escape the di∣uelish wiles of Antichrist, and also attaine euerlasting life, by biding in the faith of Christ. For the time is at hand. •.The speedie effect of gods determina∣tions. Iohn addeth this, bicause many things which are mētioned in this booke, began alreadie too come too passe: and besides that, it maketh too the comfort of the godly as hath béen said already. For seing that he intendeth too speake abundantly of their fflictions too come: too the end he may encorage thée too pa∣ience, he telleth them first that destruction is readie at hand oo light vpon the reprobates heades. After this maner doth ames comfort the faithfull that bée afflicted, saying, that the udge standeth at the doore, Iacob. 5. b. 9. And Paule saith: let our modestie bee knowen vnto all men:The profita∣blenesse of this worke. the Lord is néere at and, Philip. 4. a. 5. Iohn therefore giueth an inckling, that his booke is profitable for all ages and all men. 4. Iohn to the seuen Churches that are in Asia. Grace e vnto you, and peace from him that is, and that vvas, nd that is to come: and from the seuen spirites that are n the sight of his throne. Iohn. M.The writer of this work. Heretofore Iohn hath commended this prophesie nd Reuelation. And now in this place (after his accustomed āner) he setteth downe his salutatiō, S. and purchaseth him∣elf the fauour and attentiuenesse of his hearers in his owne erson; for that they had alreadie had experience of the great are that he toke for the welfare of the Churches. G. Moreo∣er this salutation, first of al conteineth the name of the wri∣er: Secondly it sheweth too whom his prophesie is directed. Thirdly what the writer wisheth vnto them: Fourthly from hom he wisheth it: and lastly he sheweth howe great the
dignitie & excellencie of Christ our sauiour is. As concer the writers name, he is called Iohn:Iohn. of whō somwhat is said alreadie in ye argument of this booke. To the seuē Churches. A Church is properly a cōpanie or congregatiō of Christēfolke redeemed by ye bloud of Christ,The generall definition of a Church. which suffer themselues to bée ruled by gods word, and are alwayes in this world mingled with the vngodly & vnbeléeuers: & therfore being knowē on∣ly vnto God, A. they be preserued vnder ye protectiō of Christ their shéepherd, yt they may not perish with this world: ther∣fore whersoeuer we sée Gods worde sincerely preached and heard, & the sacramēts ministred according to Christs institu∣tion: it is not too be doubted but there is some Church of God, considering yt his promise cannot deceiue: which is, whersoe∣uer two or thrée be gathered togither in my name, there am I in the middes of thē.The vniuer∣sall or catho∣like Churche.

But for as much as it is not possible for all Christs members to growe togither into one place: vnder the vniuersall Church, are cō∣prehended the seuerall Churches, which are disposed in euery towne & village, according as mans necessitie requireth: so as eche one of thē doth worthily beare the name & authoritie of a Church. A. In this respect Iohn vsing the plurall nūber sayth, he writeth too the seuen Churches: verely meaning the particular Churches which are comprehēded vnder the vni∣uersall Church. In the same sense doth Paule say, that he had a dayly care for all Churches. 2. Cor. 11. f. 28. That are in Asia.The churches of the lesser Asia, vnder which are cō∣prehended all other chur∣ches. S. The Churches that were at that time in Asia, were estéemed too excell almost all the Churches of ye whole world both in multitude of people, and in holinesse of life, according as it is too bée seene in the Acts of the Apostles, and in Paules Epistles. M. Nowe althoughe that by the name of Asia, is ment the lesser Asia wherein were the seuen Churches, & not
that great Asia which is the third part of this world: yet not∣ithstanding, by those seuen Churches and by the seuen Bi∣hops of them, are easely vnderstood all other Churches, and ll the Curates of the whole world: GR. according as by the umber of seuen the scripture do commonly betoken a gene∣alitie or vniuersalnesse.What is be∣tokened by the number of se∣uen. Like as in these textes where the ūber of seuen is put indefinitely or vncertainly: vntil ye bar∣ein woman haue borne seuē children, yt is to say many chil∣ren. 1. Kings. 2. a. 5. Also, seuen women (yt is to say many wo∣ē) shal take hold vpon on mā. Esai. 4. a. 1. Grace be vnto you  peace. R. It is a salutation or gréeting full of vehement and artie good wil. M. First he wisheth vnto thē Grace,Grace. that is too y reconcilement & the gift of the holy Ghost (G for nothing  more to be wished than to haue the fauor of God) M. & se∣ndly Peace,Peace. that is to say all other good things yt they haue ede of. For the word Peace betokeneth generally (after the stome of ye Hebrewes) all prosperitie and good successe. And holy howsoeuer all the worlde séemeth to smile vpon vs, if d be offended, euē our blissings turne into a curse. There∣e the only foundatiō of our welfare is gods good wil, wher∣ it cōmeth to passe yt we may enioy substantial and stedfast osperitie, & that our saluation is furthered euen by our ad∣rsities. Frō him that is, & that was. S.B.The euerla∣stingnesse of the Godhead. There be which think by this diuersitie of times, are distinctly betokened the thrée rsons in God: so as by him that is, should be ment God the her, according as Iames calleth him the father of lyghtes, m whom commeth euery good and perfect gifte. Chap. 1.7. But by these woordes is simplie betokened his euer∣tingnesse, C. lyke as sometime the same is betokened by a rde of the tyme paste, or of the tyme too come, Or by a orde of the tyme presente, as in Iohn. 8. g. 28. M. And God roperly sayde too bée of himselfe alone,Why God is sayd to be of himselfe. The marke yt this booke a∣meth at. bycause all other ngs haue euery one of the their beginning of him. A. which ng Paule ment too shewe at Athens, when he sayde. In  wee liue, moue, and bee, Acts. 17. f. 28. S. Notwithstanding
it may aptly be referred to the Godhead of Christ (against the heresies then springing vp, whiche denied it) which is the marke that this booke shooteth at. A. And so the copulatiue and, which is set in the beginning of the next verse, should bée put in way of exposition. For there is mentiō made of Christ by name. And from the seuen spirites. S. G. That is too say, from the seuenfold spirit:A description of the holye Ghost, and of his giftes and woorking. that is to wit, the giuer of all heauenly graces wherewith he continually garnisheth his Churche: whereof Paule speaketh in the. 1. Cor. 12. a. 4 &. 13. a. 2. &. 14. a. 1. This is the holy ghost by whom God the father worketh all things in his Sonne: by him he createth, maintaineth, moueth, quickeneth, cherisheth and preserueth all things. By him he calleth and draweth his faithfull ones vnto him, re∣generating them into new life, iustifying them, sanctifying them, enriching them with diuers sortes of graces, & streng∣thening them with heauenly strength, vntill they attaine to the vttermost point of saluation. A. Of the Godhead of which spirit it is not lawfull to doubt, according as it is to be sée in Math. 28.Why the holy Ghost is cal∣led manyfold. d. 19. &. Iohn. 7. f. 39. &. 14. c. 17. &. 16. b. 13. & Acts. 5. a. 4. &. 13. a. 2. and in many other places. And although he bée most single in himselfe: yet in respect of the giftes that he be∣stoweth vpon men, he is called manifold. Neither is menti∣on made here of seuen spirites, as thoughe the giftes of the holie Ghost ought to be restrained to the number of seuen (as some vnskilful persons would gather vpon ye text of Esai. 11. a. 2.) but for as much as the number of seuen is put infinit¦ly (as hath béen saide afore) it is no maruell though it be ta∣ken in this place, for all the giftes of the holy Ghost, where∣with God enricheth his Churche. That are in the sight of h Throne.Why the ho∣ly Ghoste is syd to be be∣fore Gods throne. S. That is to say, which seuenfold spirit he hath as were laide vp in store in a treasurie, and in a readinesse deale him abundantly vnto those too whom he hath app¦ted him from euerlasting by Christ the mediator. Iohn. 3.  34. &. 7. f. 39. The holy Ghost is said to be in the sight of Go throne, that is to say, before his Throne: questionlesse ioyn
in gouernment with the father and the sonne. For the throne is oftentimes put for the kingdome.Angelles. The holy Ghost then is with the God of glorie, power and maiestie. &c. Neuerthelesse this place might (not amisse) bée expounded, of Angels. Not that Iohn should in any behalfe either match thē with God, or compare them with Christ: but in such wise as Paule ci∣teth God, and Christ and the Angells togither for witnesses, 1. Tim. 5. d. 21. Christ therefore is described héere as God, and these seuen spirites are placed as seruaunts before ye throne, and so consequently before Christ, as who sitteth by God the father. 5. And from Iesu Christ, vvhich is a faithfull vvit∣nesse, the first begottē of the dead, and lord of the kings of the earth. Vnto him that hath loued vs, and vvashed vs from our sinnes by the bloud of him. And from Iesu Christ. M.Why mētion is made of Chryste by name. Bicause Christ hath purchased our saluation by taking mans nature vpon him, and by accom∣plishing the misterie of our redemption in the same: héere is xpresse mention made of him. Besides this, in as much as he s ordeined too bée the mediator betwene God and men: loke what gifts so euer were necessarie for the Church, he hath re∣ceiued them of the father, too dispose them among men, that (as it were by his hand) ther might be delt vnto vs whatso∣euer is needfull for our welfare, according as Paule witnes∣seth, saying: when he went vp a loft, he led captiuitie captiue, and gaue giftes vnto men. Ephe. 4. b. 8.Christe a faithfull wit∣nesse, & what and to what ende he wit∣nesseth. VVhich is a faithfull witnesse, G. that is to say, soothfast and worthie to be beléeued. •. Christ our sauiour is called a faithfull witnesse aboue all others, bycause that béeyng as it were in his fathers bosom, he hath vttered the fathers secrets vnto vs, Iohn. 1. c. 18. and hath not learned ye things that he hath disclosed, at any other mans hand but onely at the fathers: namely how incredible good will the heauenly father beareth towards vs wretches, n so much as he hath pardoned our sin, and adopted vs to be
his children, yea and heires of his heauenly kyngdome (if so be that we beleue him:) and also other greate things whiche we héere him auouch of his fatherly good will towards vs, by the storie of the gospel, to the intent we shoulde with singular affection worship & loue the heauēly father. Which thing the Lord had promised long agoe in the person of Dauid, saying: Behold he hath giuen him for a witnesse vnto nations,Gods worde  witnessing. for a captain & schoolemaster vnto ye heathen. Esa. 55. b. 4. A. Wher∣vpon also he himselfe calleth his owne woorde a witnessing: We speake (sayth he) the thing that we knowe, and we wit∣nesse the thing that we haue séene: and ye receiue not oure witnesse Iohn. 3. b. 11. And vnto the president Pylate he sayd: To this intent am I borne, and to this ende came I into the world, that I should beare witnesse vnto the truth. Euery one that is of the truth heareth my voyce. Iohn. 18. g. 37. P. Héere∣vnto also perteineth that which he said in that excellent pray∣er of his to his Father, I haue made thy name knowen vntoo them, and wil make it known vnto them, that the loue wherwith thou hast loued mée may be in them, & I in them: Iohn. 17. d. 26. A Happie are they as many as settle themsel∣ues in so faithfull a record: and contrarywise vnhappie & for∣lorne are all they that discredit it. For lyke as the beléeuers doe set to their seales, that God is soothfaste (Iohn. 3. d. 33.) so the other sorte (as muche as in them is) doo make God a lier 1.Chryste the first begotten of the dead. Iohn. 5. b. 10. considering that the recorde of Christe is none other than the recorde of God. The firste begotten of the dead. Christ is therefore called the first begotten of the dead, Col. 1. c. 18. and the firstlings of them that ryse againe. 1. Cor. 15. c. 20, bycause he hath begon the new life by his death, and perfected it by his resurrection: not that the dead came too lyfe again immediatly at his death, but bycause hys death was the beginning and enterance intoo life. Therfore it stan∣deth with verie good reason, that wheras the breaking vp of the graues at Christes death was a forehansell of the newe lyfe: the frute or effecte thereof was not séene tyll the thirde daye after, bycause that then, Chryste at his rising agayne
ledde other in his companie out of their graues. And by this miracle, it was shewed, that he neyther died nor rose againe priuately for himselfe, but to the ende to breathe the sent of lyfe intoo all beléeuers. For his rising agayn,The ende of Christes re∣surrection. was to the end that béeing the conquerour of death and lorde of lyfe, he should reigne for euer, and make his seruants partakers of his bles∣sed immortalitie. And there is no cause why any man should obiect that dyuers were raysed from death before Chryste, as well in the olde Testamente as in the newe. For as well héere, as also in the 1. Cor. 15. c. 20. and in Colloss. 1. c. 18. the textes concerne the full and perfect resurrection, wherby our bodie shall not only be set frée from death, but also bée made immortall: whych thyng those menne obteyned not whiche were raysed from death before Christes rising, for they died afterward ageyne. E. In Chryst therfore began the Resurre∣ction, and it shalbée finished in vs. And like as he came whole again at the receyuing agein of his bodie: so shall wée also bée wholly alyue again. For the head is not plucked away from the members. Therfore in his rysing again, there was giuen a most certein proofe and assurance, that his other members and the rest of his portions shall ryse again likewise. For the heauenly father hathe set forthe an example in his sonne, in what wyse he is mynded towardes al flesh. B. Wherfore looke what wée sée come too passe in Christs flesh, that may euery one of vs beléeue, shall come too passe in our owne flesh. For wée are Christs, and Christ is ours, and Christs flesh is the syster of our fleshe. Hee neuer tooke vppon him the séede of the Angels, but the séede of Abraham, and is become like vntoo his brothers in all things, sauing sinne. Hebr. 2. d. 17. & 4. d. 15. Therfore the life and resurrection of Christ is the life and re∣surrection of all the faythfull. A. And all these thinges ought too procure excéedyng greate comforte in oure myndes. And I Lorde of the Kynges of the earthe. S.Christe is the lord of all lor∣des, and king of all kings. This style of Christes is matched agaynste the slaunder of deathe, least any man hearing hym to be deade, myghte thinke he were
quite dispatched. For Chryst is in suche wyse dead, as by dy∣ing he vanquished death, and brought lyfe abroade intoo the worlde, which thyng was made manyfest in his Resurrecti∣on. Héervpon Paule sayeth that he was exalted from death, and a name was giuē him aboue al names, that in the name of Iesus, all knées shall shoulde bowe. &c. Philip. 2. b. 9.10. And in an other place, To this ende (sayth he) did Christ dye and rise againe, that he might haue dominion ouer quick and deade. Rom. 14. b. 9. M. And in asmuch as he is the verie wise∣dome of the Father: Kings reigne by him, and lawmakers determine righte by him. Prouerb. 8. b. 15. A. But concer∣ning Christes kingdome, lordship, and power, sée the psalme 2.Christs king¦dome, lordship and power. b. 6. & 45. a. 4. and. 72. b. 8. and 110. a. 2. & Esai. 9. b. 6. and. 45. d. 23. and 43. d. Math. 11. d. 27. and. 28. d. 18. and Iohn. 13. a. 3. and. 17. b. 2.7. and Act. 5. f. 31. & Heb. 2. c. 10. All whiche places doe bothe minister ryght singular grounde of comfort to all the Godly: and also muste needes strike verie greate terror into the wicked persecuters of the Churche. For they cannot escape his hande, but muste feele him to bee the soueraine iudge of the worlde whome they carelesly despysed. In the meane whyle it is to be consydered, that althoughe Chryste be termed Lorde of the Kyngs of the earth: yet is not his kyngdome other than spirituall:Christs king¦dom altoge∣ther spiritual. leaste a man myghte by thys pretence in any wyse fauour the Popishe tyrannie, as thoughe Chryste woulde haue the ministers of his worde, (whyche teache the people in his name) to be sette in supe∣rioritie ouer Kyngs and Princes.Ca. 1. vers. 5. iterum. Rulers in Christes churche. M. For the hyghest honour that can bée, is for a man too bée a seruaunte in Chrystes Churche. Hée then that is called in the Churche to bée a ru∣ler or Shepehearde in the Churche, muste knowe that he hathe taken in hande a seruice, and not a souerayntie. Peter therefore when he prescribeth what Shepheardes ought to do, sayth: behaue not your selues lordlike ouer the Clergie, but be ye patternes to the flocke. 1. Pet. 5. a. 3. Paule also sayth, Let men so estéeme vs as Chrystes seruaunts, and
dealers forth of gods mysteries. 1. Cor. 4. a. 1. Those then that be chosen vnto Bishoprikes, haue allotted to them, not a so∣ueraintie, but a seruice, nor a supremacie or princehod, but o∣bedience. And therfore when Peter spake of Iudas the tray∣tour, He was admitted (saith he) into our number, & had ligh∣ted vpon a lot of this piece of seruice. Act. 1. c. 17.The lordly∣nesse of the Pope and his clergie. Wherefore it appéereth manifestly, that the lordlinesse of the Popishe Bi∣shops B.V. is not of Chryst, but of the worlde, and of the diuell the Prince of this worlde, and that the lowlynesse which the chief of them pretendeth, is but fayned and counterfait, when he calleth himselfe the seruant of Gods seruants. And wheras the Pope hath proudly aduaunced himselfe aboue kings and princes vnder pretence of Christes king∣dome, whose vicar he will be counted: it is to be counted no better than traytrous tyrannie, according as we shal sée more plentuously in this booke. Vnto him that hath loued vs.Gods loue to∣wards man∣kynde. This is referred vntoo the father in this sense: that Christe was a faythfull wytnesse to the father, who loued vs and washed vs from our sinnes by the bloud of him. For if it had had respect vnto Christ, it must haue bin trāslated his or his own bloud, and not the bloud of him. S. Iohn therefore imputeth this lo∣uing vnto the Father, lyke as Chryst himselfe also doth, say∣ing: God so loued the world that he gaue his only begotten son, Iohn. 3. b. 16. And Paule sayth: God setteth out his loue towards vs, in that whē we were as yet sinners, Christ died for vs. Rom. 5. b. 8. And in an other place it is sayd, Herein appeared the loue of God towards vs, that God sent his on∣ly begotten sonne intoo the worlde, that wée myght liue by hym. &c. 1. Iohn. 4. b. 9. And washed vs from our sinnes. On∣ly God was able to clenze vs from oure synnes:Onely God clenseth and releaseth sinne Whiche thyng was not vnknowne to the verie Phariseys, according as the Euangelist reporteth, saying: Who can release sin∣nes but onely God? Marke. 2. a. 7. And he himself speaketh thus by the Prophete: I euen I, am he that wypeth oute thyne iniquities for myne owne sake. Esai. 43. d. 25. Hée ad∣deth,
By the blud∣shed of Christ Iesus. By the bloud of him, that is to wit, which gaue his lyfe for the raunsome of many, Math. 22. d. 28. for euen so saith he of his owne bloud whereof he gaue the Sacrament too hys Disciples. It shall be shed for you and for many. Math. 26. c. 28. And the Apostle Paule sayth: Whom God hath set to bée an attonementmaker through fayth in his bloud. Rom. 3. d. 25. A. Also, by whom wée haue redemption, through his bloud and forgiuenesse of sinnes, Colos. 1. b. 14. Loke also in the Acts. 20. f. 28. and Ephe. 1. b. 7. &. 2. c. 13. &. 5. f. 25. and Heb. 9. d. 12. &. 1. Petr. 1.The right si∣gnification & vse of baptim. a. 2. d. 19. &. 1. Iohn 1. c. 7. S. By Baptime wherwith we be washed outwardly, is signified yt we be washed inwardly by the bloud of Christ, the remembrance wherof all the Apo∣stles indeuered too worke in the myndes of the faythfull. A. And yet Sathan hath streyned himselfe too the vttermost too bring in such things as might eyther suppresse, or at least∣wise greatly deface the worthinesse of so excellent a Iewell. Of which sort of things are merites,Toyes iniu∣rious vnto baptim. satisfactions, workes of ouerplus or supererogation as they terme thē, free will, pur∣gatorie, and such other gewgawes wherby the bloud of gods sonne is troden vnder foote, and made of none effecte, whyle men father the most part of their saluation vpon such forge∣ries as these. 6. And made vs kings and priests to God and to his father, Too him bee glorie andor power, or strength. dominion for euer and euer. Amen. And made vs Kings and Priestes. S. Wonderfull and incre∣dible surely is the mercie of God the father towardes vs, who hath so loued vs sinners (yea and Children of death) as no man coulde loue eyther his friendes or his benefactors more. It had béene somewhat, if hée had but chosen vs too be hys seruauntes,The faithfull be kings and Priests vnto God. but he hath made vs Kings and Priestes: than which there can bée no greater honour. And that not by water, after the manner of Aaron and hys sonnes when they shoulde execute the office of their Priesthood: but hée
hath purged vs by the bloud of his onely begotten and déere beloued Sonne, too the intente he myghte make vs méete ministers for suche a charge. Christ our Lorde was alone King and Priest too God the father: but he right courteously hathe taken vs intoo copartnership of hys office. Whose kingdome and Priesthood are treated of in the Psalmes. 2. b. 6. and. 45. a. 4. &. 100. a. 2. And of our reignyng and Priest∣hood (whereof the olde ones represented a figure, according as it is sayde, yée shall bée vntoo mée a Priestly kingdome, Exodus. 19. a. 6.) Sainct Peter speaketh, 1. Epistle. 2. a. 5. b. 9. A. Whereof the faythfull are called Christians,Why wee bee called Chri∣stians. bycause they bée partakers of that anoynting wherewith God anoynted Christ King and Priest aboue all hys fellowes. Psal. 45. b. 8. and. Hebrues. 1. c. 9. As concerning the Kingdome,Howe wee reigne. Chryste himselfe witnesseth the same too bée within vs, Luke. 17. e. 21. that is too witte when God reygneth in vs, namely by his woord and holy spirit, by the power wherof we also do reigne ouer sin, Satan, death, and Hell. And that commeth to passe by only faith, which is said to be the victorie that ouercōmeth the worlde, 1. Iohn. 5. a. 4. Also we bée called Priestes,How wee bee priestes and of our sacri∣fice. B. not that we offer him any Massing sacrifice as the Papistes doe, G. but to yéeld our bodyes a liuing sacrifyce, holy, and accep∣table vnto God. Rom. 12. a. 1. And to offer spirituall sacrifices acceptable vnto God by Iesus Christ. 1. Petr. 2. a. 5. The ob∣lations and sacrifices of the faythfull bée all the duetyes of charitie: wherewith when we embrace our brethren, we ho∣nour the Lord himselfe in his members: and secondly al our prayers, praises and thankesgiuings, and whatsoeuer else is done of vs too the honour and seruice of God.The ende of Christian sa∣crifice. And this kynde of Sacrifyce perteyneth not any thing too the appeasing of Gods wrathe, nor any thing too the obteyning of forgyue∣nesse of synnes, nor anye thing too the purchacing of rygh∣tuousnesse: but consisteth onely in magnifying and exal∣tyng God: for truely nothing can bée acceptable vnto God sauyng at the hande of those whome (hauyng alreadye
receiued forgiuenesse of their sinnes) he hath recōciled to him∣selfe by some other meanes, and therfore hath set them cléere from all giltinesse. Of these sacrifices of the faithfull which must be done in the Church continually, sée Malachie. 1. d. 11. Psal. 50. b. 14. &. 51. d. 19. &. 141. a. 2. & Osée. 14. a. 2. & Heb. 13. c. 15. &. 1.Howe and why God is Christes fa∣ther, & God. Petr. 2. b. 9. & Phil. 4. d. 18. Too God and to his father. M. God is Christs father in respect of his Godhead, and his God in re∣spect of his manhood. Herevpon he said vnto Marie, go to my brothers and say vnto them, I ascend to my father and your father, to my God and your God. Iohn. 20. d. 17. Too him bee glorie and dominion for euer & euer. Sobeit. M. After that Iohn hath rehearsed the vnspeakable benefite of God purchased for vs by Christ: he worthily bursteth forthe into praises and thanksgiuing. The same things welnéere are written in. 2. Petr. 3. d. 18. 7. Behold, he commeth vvith cloudes, and all eyes shall see him, and they thatSome also read, they that haue pusshed or stri∣ken him tho¦rough, and all Tribes shall wring theyr handes before him. pricked him, and all ∣reds of the earth shall vvaile ouer him. yea. Amen. Beholde he commeth with cloudes. A. Too the intent that Iohn may comfort all godly folke the more, and put the wic∣ked in feare: hée setteth forth, Christ comming too iudge the whole world,Christs com∣ming to iud∣gement. for his mentioning of Gods iudgement serueth too this purpose, that suche as grone vnder the crosse, shoulde waite paciently for the day of redemption: and that suche as are enimies to the good and persecute them, shoulde either a∣mende, or else knowe for a certentie, that the rightuous iudge will lay such punishment vpon them, as their sinnes haue de∣serued. For Christ shall render vnto euery man according to his déedes, that is to wit, life euerlasting to such as séeke glo∣rie and honor and immortalitie by doing good, and as for them that are full of strife and obey not the truth, but folow vnrigh∣tuousnesse, vpon them shall come indignation and wrath. &c. Rom. 2. a. 8. And Enoch the seuenth from Adam, is reported to haue prophecyed in this wise: Behold the Lord commeth
with his thousands of Saincts, to do iustice vppon all men, and to rebuke al such as are vngodly for al the works which they haue done wickedly,The terrible∣nesse and so∣deynnesse of Gods iudge∣mentes. and for all the hard thinges that the wicked sinners haue spoken agaynst him. Iude. c. 14.15. VVith cloudes. S. Certain Psalmes and Prophets make God to ride vpon the Cloudes, and to be caried vpon the wynges of the winds: whereby they séeme to méene that the venge∣ance of Gods iudgements shall be both terrible and also so∣daine. So also did Christ answer the high Préest: I say vnto you, from hencefoorth ye shall see the sonne of man sitting at the right hand of power, and comming in the Cloudes of the aire. Math. 26. f. 64. q. d. When ye sée him comming so,What it is to fit at the right hād of power. then as certaynly as certaine may be, ye shall féele the power of the sonne of man by experience: and whome ye now take to be but the sonne of man, then ye shall féele him to be euen the sonne of God also. Nay rater at such time as the keepers of his Sepulcher published the glory of his resurrection: when signes and wonders were wrought in his name by the ser∣uice of his Apostles: whē folke came rūning to him by heaps at the preaching of the Gospel, and despising the riches and pleasures of the world, did set their mindes vppon the hea∣uenly lyfe, A. when so great a multitude of people left the la∣wyers and Pharisies, and flocked about the Apostles & the other company of the faithfull, S. when the reuengement of innocent bloud was executed vpon the Iewish nation by the destruction of Ierusalem: then euen in spight of their harts they saw Christ sitting at the right hand of God, and wor∣king all these things with incredible power. Therfore Iohn in this place maketh the Cloudes an auouchment of the di∣uine maiestie and heauenly power in Christ: according to that saying of the Psalme, Cloudes and darknesse are round about him. &c. Psal. 97. a. 2. M. Moreouer,Chryst shall come to iudge¦ment in the clowdes. like as Christ went vp in a Cloude, so shall he come downe to iudgement in a Cloude: A. according as he hath told his seruants aforehand, saying: They shall sée the sonne of man comming in the
Cloudes of the aire, with power and much glory. And he shal send his Angells, &c. Math. 24. c. 30. Also when the men of Galile gazed after Christ as he ascended into heauen, the An∣gelles said vnto them, This Iesus which is taken vp from you into heauen, shall come in the same wise as you haue séene him going vp into heauen, Act. 1. b. 11. But in their sighte (as it is said in the ninth verse) was he taken vp aloft, and a cloude conueyed him from their eyes. No doubt therefore but he shall come againe in a cloude. Which thing Paule also knowing for a certentie should come to passe, writeth in this wise: Then shall we that shall be aliue and which shall be re∣maining, be caught vp with them in the Cloudes, to méete the Lord in the aire, and so shall we be with the Lorde for e∣uer. 1. Thessa. 4. d. 17. G. Furthermore, that whiche is spoken here of the Cloudes, is referred to the manifest comming of him that shall be iudge, P. for he that came first priuily to be iudged, shall then come openly to iudge. S. Therefore it is for the godly to wish euery houre for the comming of their iudge: and contrariwise for the wicked and skorners to wishe that he may tarie away a long while, according as it is saide in Math. 24. d. 48. &. 2. Peter. 3. a. 4. A. Howsoeuer then that the wicked runne royot, and carelesly reiect the day of the Lorde: let vs always beare in mind this saying of the Prophet, The Lord will come to iudgement with the elders of his people and with the princes of them.The generall and vniuersall resurrection. Esay. 3. c. 14. And all eyes shall see him: G. that is to say as many as are endewed with reason, both Angelles, men, and féends. A. This thing hath Christ be∣tokened more at large, saying: When the sonne of man shall come in his glory and all the holy Angelles with him: then shall he sit vpon the seate of his glory, and all nations shall be gathered togither before him Math. 25. c. 31. For God hath appointed him iudge of the quicke and the dead. Act. 10. g. 42. And as well the vngodly as the godly shall rise agayne, as it is easy to gather by Daniell. 12. a. 2. & Iohn. 5. e. 28. Math. 25. c. 32. &. Act. 24. d. 15. P. The vnbeléeuers shall sée him in his flesh in
which it was his will to suffer, and not in his Godhead, which continued vnable to suffer and inuisible.How the re∣probates shall see Chryst. And therefore Iohn addeth immediatly, And they that pricked him. A. This séemeth to be taken out of the prophesie of Zacharie. 12. c. 10. and it a∣gréeth with that of Deut. 32. e. 35. Vengeance is mine and I will requite it. In whiche places for as much as the punish∣ment of the vngodly is put off to a long day to come:Of the pric∣king of Christ and howe the Iewes see him. the holy Ghost doth vs to wit that the wicked preuayle and get the vpper hand in this world: howbeit in suche wise, as they cut their owne throtes with their owne swords. For the more they prosper in their attēpts, so much the iuster do they take their case to be, by reason whereof they be vtterly blinded and rush into Gods sore vengeance. They therefore that go about to expound this place concerning Christ, according to the let∣ter: do wrest it too violently. Neyther doth the Apostle cite it to that end, but rather to shew that Christe is the same God, which cōplained lōg ago by Zacharie, yt his hart was thrust through by the Iewes. And in that place God speaketh after the maner of men, doing vs to wit that he is as sore gréeued at the wickednesse of his people, (& specially at their wilfull despising of his word) as a mortall man is that hath his hart striken through with a deadly wounde: Like as in another place he sayth, yt his hart is nipped with heauinesse. Now thē forasmuch as Christ is God manifested in ye flesh: Iohn saith, that the thing whiche his diuine maiestie had suffered at the Iewes hands in such wise as he could suffer, was openly ac∣complished in his visible flesh. Not that God can take harme at mans hand, or that the reproches whiche they offer hym can reach vnto him from the earth: but bycause that by suche manner of spéech he ment to expresse, of howe high treason wicked men be giltie when they stubbornly aduance them∣selues vp to heauen. And worthily dothe Iohn ascribe that thyng too the Iewes, which was done by the hand of a Romayne souldiar: like as in another place they be reported to haue crucifyed the sonne of God, Actes. 2. f. 36. and. 3. c. 15.
although they put not one fingar to his body. M. As cōcerning this seeing, some take it to be méent of the conuersion of the Iewes, whereof there is a certaine example set downe in Act. 2. f. 37. R. For then began they to looke vnto Christ, (yea and that with mourning and repentance,) whome they had striken through afore. Othersome expound it of the venge∣ance that was too light vpon the wicked, as it hath bin sayde already. But if the place be weyed throughly, it séemeth to comprehend both: that is to wit, that at length God will ga∣ther togither the remnantes of that forlorne and desperate nation, vnto soule health: and also by his horrible vengeance make those despisers see with whome they haue to deale. For we knowe they were wont to skoffe as boldly at the Pro∣phets, as if they had told them but tales and not any message from God. God telleth them they shall not scape vnpunished with their so doing, for he will at length take in hande the maintenance of his owne cace.The angui∣shes of the re∣probates. And ouer him shall wayle. B. To the end he may strengthen the godly against the great stub∣bornesse of the world, he sayth, that the wayling and lamen∣ting of them. S. whiche despised Gods healthfull counsell, and heaped sinne vppon sinne, when the Apostles and other ministers of Christ preached repentance and forgiue∣nesse of sinnes by his name, shal be great. A. They shal waile indeede: but this ouerlate repentance shall nothing auayle them, no more than it did the traytor Iudas. Math. 27. a. 3. Or than the feares of Esau booted him. Hebr. 12. d. 17. Con∣trariwise, the iust man shall féele excéeding ioy, and he shall be glad: yea and when he séeth the vengeance, he shall washe his hands in the bloud of the sinner. Psal. 58. b. 9. for the faith∣full shall also be iudges of the worlde,The damned of all sortes. according as Paule teacheth. 1. Cor. 6. a. 2. Whereas he sayth, All the kinreds of the earth, it is the figure Synecdoche, wherby a part is takē for the whole: as if he should say some of all sorts, are the more part of men. M. For lyke as out of all kinreds is gathered the number of the elect: euen so also out of all kinreds shall be
gathered the number of the damned. Besides this in asmuch as many he called and few chosen, (Math. 20. b. 16. &. 32. h. 14) the children of God are scarce counted any number at all. G. although the names of them be written in the booke of lyfe.What is mēt by the worde Amen. Yea, Amen. S. Amen among the Hebrues betokeneth common∣ly an affirming or allowing of a thing, like as Etiam dothe a∣mong the Latins, and as Yea, or so beit doth among vs Eng∣lish men. By which terme, they meane that they agrée to the opinion of other men, and subscribe their sayings, and also that they wish the same thing with their hart, whiche some forespeaker hath prayed in wordes set togyther for the pur∣pose. So is that terme vsed in Psalmes and prayers. A. accor∣ding as it is to be seene in. 1. Cor. 14. c. 16. Howbeit among the Hebrues, their Amen importeth an assuring or oth, according as we sée the same tearme vsed in the Gospell. M. Therefore looke what Iohn sayth heere, the same is the common voyce of all the elect, who desire nothing more in their harts, than the comming of the Iudge. A.The godlie doe long for Christs com∣ming. Bycause they be sure that then their redemption is at hand. Luke. 21. f. 28. Whervpon Paule sayth, that all the godly do loue the cōming of Christ. 2. Tim. 4. b. 8. And in the end of this Prophecie we shall heare that common voyce of the Church Yea or Sobeit, come Lord Iesu: herafter chapter, 22. d. 20. G. Also the doubling of the affirmati∣on betokeneth the earnestnesse, where through the children of God do long for the perfect redemption, whereof Paule trea∣teth largely Rom. 8. d. 23. 8. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending sayth the Lorde, vvhiche is, vvhiche vvas, and vvhich is to come, the almightie. I am Alpha and Omega. He that is first in any thing,Gods euerla∣stingnesse & euerbeeing. is also by a prouerb called among the Gréekes, Alpha: as for exam∣ple in Martiall, the Alpha of clokemen. And Omega is the last of the Gréeke letters: and therefore in way of exposition there is added, The beginning and the ending or the first and the last.
A. So sayth the Lord by his prophet, I the Lord am the firste, and euen I the selfsame am also with the last. Esay. 41. a. 4. And in another place, Thus sayth the king of Israell, and the redéemer of him, the Lord of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no God. Esa. 44. a. 6. Ther is in manner the same thing in Esay. 48. c. 12. And Iohn wyll repeate the same sentence againe in this present Chapter the 11. verse, and also hereafter in the Chapter. 21. b. 6. &. 22. c. 13. G. And God is called so, bycause that of him, by him, and in him are al things.The excellēt∣nesse of this prophesie. Rom. 11. d. 36. Sayth the Lord. M. q. d. These words (sayth Iohn) are not mine, but his that is the beginning and the ending, the first and the last. VVhich is, and which was, and which is to come. This same is writtē here sillable for sillable in Gréeke as it was written afore in the fourth verse, sée the exposition of it there.Gods almigh¦tinesse, & the vse therof. The almighty. A. This title agréeth to god only, according as he blazeth himselfe by it saying: I am God almighty, Gen. 17. a. 1. &. 35. a. 11: The knowing whereof wyll stand vs in small stedde, if we make it not a matter of confi∣dence for vs, so as we not only beléeue simply that God is al∣mightie, but also that he preserueth and maintaineth vs by his might. For we must note feoffe such an almightines vpō him as is surmised by sophisters: that is to wit, an emptie, sléeping, and idle one: but a waking, effectuall, and workfull one. For God is therefore almightie, not bycause he is able to do, and yet in the meane while sits sitl and doth nothyng: but bycause all things are conteyned in his hand, heauen & earth are gouerned by his prouidence, and all things are done and disposed by his determination and appoyntment. For if he do all things which he listeth, (Psal. 115. a. 3.) and nothing can es∣cape his care and forecast: it followeth that nothing is done but by his will and working. The faithfull therefore are ar∣med with double comfort by Gods almightinesse both in that they perceiue there is sufficient abilitie of benefyting to fur∣ther the welfare of the godly, in the hand of him whose arme is stretched out to rule, worke, and dispose al things: in whose
possession is both heauen and earth: and whose commaunde∣ment all creatures haue an eye vnto: and also bycause they sée there is sufficient safetie in his protection, to whose will al anoyances that may be feared frō elsewhere are subiect, and by whose commaundement (as it were by a bridle) Sathan with all his practises, yea and whatsoeuer else is against the welfare of ye godly, is restrayned. A. This is it that made Da∣uid to say with suche boldnesse, The Lorde is my sauegard, whome shall I feare? If armies were incamped against me, yet shall not my hart be afraid: if battell rise vp against me, in him will I put my trust. Psalm. 27. a. 1.3. And againe, al∣though I should walke in the valy of the shadow of death, yet wil I feare no harme: bycause thou art with me. Thy staffe and thy Shéepehooke are they that haue comforted me, Psal. 23. a. 3. Also here is confirmed the authoritie of this booke, in as much as the euerlasting God is the author thereof. 9. I Iohn your brother, and partaker in tribulation, and in the kingdom, andor sufferance. in patience in Iesu Christ, vvas in the ile vvhich is called Pathmos, for the vvorde of God, and for the vvitnessing of Iesu Christ. I Iohn. S. G. Vnto his holy gréeting, now he addeth his decla∣ratiō wher first of al he giueth an incling of ye person to whom the reuelatiō was made,A commen∣dation of this worke by the person of the wryter. & so maketh ye boke the more cōmen∣dable: M. And afterward setteth downe the place, ye cause of the place, & the time of this prophesie, that it may be of the more authoritie amōg al the godly. Your brother. N. He acknowled∣geth ye vnitie which he hath with all the rest of the faithfull in respect of christē religiō. S. q. d. I Iohn your brother,A brother. whome ye know to be most streitly linked vnto you by brotherly loue, yea & possessed with thoughtful care of your welfare. A. Great (I assure you) was ye modesty of this mā,Iohns mo∣destie or meeldnesse. who though he had ye knowledge of great misteries reueled vnto him by Christ, yea and was far more excellēt & earnest in maynteining ye truth, thā they to whom he writeth: doth notwithstāding not prefer
himselfe proudely afore them, but imputing all thing  Gods grace, calleth them his brethren: knowing how it was said of Christ, wil not you yourselues to be called maister, for there is one that is your maister, euen Christ, and all you be brothers, Math. 23. a. 8. B. By whiche name the faithfull must exhort one another to vnitie of fayth and earnestnesse of loue. Herevpon sayth Peter, Loue one another earnestly from a pure hart, being borne anew, not of mortall séede, but of im∣mortall séede by the word of God which liueth and dureth for euer. 1. Peter. 1. d. 22. Also there be many texts making to this purpose, in Rom. 12. c. 10. &. 1. Thessa. 4. b 9. &. Heb. 13. a. 1. &. 1. Pet. 4.The brother∣ly compassion of Christiās. b. 8. &. 1. Iohn. 2. b. 10. And partaker in tribulation. Bicause the tribulation which they to whome Iohn wrate, did suffer at the hands of heretikes and false Apostles, did also increase his tribulatiō: now he hath compassion of them as of a flocke set vppon by wolues, that is to say, by persecutors and false teachers whiche peruerted them. For the members of one body be glad togither and sad togither, both with their heade, and one with another, according as the Apostle writeth. 1. Cor. 12. d. 26. A. And in another place it is said, Remember thē that are in bonds, as if ye were in bondes with them: and of those that be in tribulation, as ye which are also in the body. Heb. 13. a. 3. Looke also in Rom. 12. c. 15. &. 2. Cor. 11. g. 29. S. This louing affection of Iohns therefore, auayleth greatly to win him credite. For who would not giue diligent eare to his doc∣trine, and be ruled by his counsell, whome he is perswaded, or rather of whome he is assured to be so well minded to∣wards him?Christs low∣lynesse. Also all the words that be set héere, are as farre off as may be from the statelinesse which the Prelats of the Churches of our times pretend: and they sauor of a certayne singular vnderweening. Your brother (sayth he) and partaker in tribulation. A. Neuerthelesse by these words he meaneth, not only the affliction which they suffered, but also the afflic∣tion that was layd vpon himselfe for confessing the name of Christ,How the god¦lie be parta∣kers of reig∣ning, or of the heauenlye kingdome in this lyfe. according as we shall sée anone. And in the kingdome.
Least the faithfull myght cast downe their heartes by reason of persecution: too comfort them withall, Iohn addeth, not onely that he is a partaker of their tribulations, but also of the kingdome, that is to say of the glorie that is layde vp for all the godly. According as Iames teacheth saying, blessed is the man that beareth out temptation, bycause that when he is tryed, he shall receyue a Crowne of glorie, which the Lord hath promised too them that loue hym. Iames. 1. b. 12. This glorie of the heauenly Kingdome falleth not too the Children of God, till after this lyfe. Notwithstanding for as muche as the hope of it cannot disappoynte them: they are iustly sayde too bée partakers of that benefyte, euen whyle they bée still conuersant vpon earth. In respecte hereof Paule sayth, it is a sure saying: for if wée bée deade with hym, wée shall also lyue with him: and if wée suffer wyth him, wée shall also raygne with him. 2. Timothi. 2. b. 11. B. Also, if wée bée Sonnes, wée are also heires, I meane the heires of God, and coheires with Christ, if so bée that wée suffer with him that wée may also bée glorifyed with hym. Rom. 8. c. 17. And Peter sheweth expressely, that thys glory is not yet playne∣ly shewed vpon the faythfull, but they muste wayte for it wyth most assured hope. The Elders (sayth he) which are among you, I exhorte whiche am also an Elder and a wit∣nesse of Christes afflictions, and also a partaker of the glo∣rie whiche shall bée shewed openly. 1. Peter. 5. a. 1.Of the true pacience. Sée also 2. Timo. 4. b. 8. and. Ephes. 2. b. 6. And pacience, G. for as much as the faythfull can not stande in tribulations without paci∣ence: Iohn auoucheth himselfe too bée theyr partaker in af∣fliction and Pacience, which suffereth all thyngs, A. and is not displeased nor grudgeth not agaynst God: but beareth quietly whatsoeuer he sendeth. G. Neuerthelesse it is too bée noted, that not euerie manner of tribulation ingendereth pacience, for wée sée the wicked too ware harder and har∣der at Gods squorging. But the faythfull who are endued with the holye Ghost (knowyng that nothing happeneth
by casualitie,) consider Gods will, acknowledge his iustice and vprightnesse, and being certainely perswaded that God hath a care of them, do with quyet mynde beare whatsoeuer affliction befalleth them: A. nay rather, they conceyue the more boldnesse to pray and hope well, in that they knowe themselues to rest only vpon Gods will. Therefore whither it be pouertie, or banishment, or imprisonment, or slaunder, or sicknesse, or losse of kinsfolke and fréends, or any such lyke thing that vexeth them: they cōsider that none of these things happeneth without the apointment and prouidence of God: and therewithall also they remember, that God doth nothyng but in most rightfull order. Héerevppon springeth patience, héere vppon springeth hope, héere vppon springeth spirituall ioy, according as a man may sée in the Apostles, who being whipped went reioycing from the presence of the counsell, for that they had bin counted worthy to suffer reproche for the name of Iesus.What trubles make our pa∣tience accep∣table to God Act. 5. g, 41. In Chryst Iesu. G. Thys par∣cell betokeneth in thys place, that that only tribulation is holy and good vnto vs, whiche is layd vpon vs for Chrystes name: and also that patience is not of our selues but of God, like as all other good thyngs be. I was in the Ile which is cal∣led Pathmos. A. The circumstance of the place maketh not a little to the auouchment of the truth.It is now called Palmosa. Pathmos signifyeth as much as deadly or deathfull. It is a little Ile in the Aegean Sea, whereinto it is reported that Iohn the Apostle was banished by the Emperoure Domitian, and wrate the Apo∣calips there. Of which matter Eusebius writeth in the third booke and eightéenth Chapter of his history of the Churche. For the word of God.Persecution followeth Gods word. It is knowen what the Apostle saythe, all that wyll lyue godlyly in Christe Iesu must suffer perse∣cution. 2. Timo. 3. c. 12. But if this be incident to all the godly: much more shall the preachers of Gods worde and the faith∣full witnesses of Christe be in daunger of persecution, accor∣ding as Chryste hathe told his Apostles afore hand, If they haue persecuted me (saythe he) they shall persecute you also:
and if they haue kéept my sayings, they shall kéepe yours al∣so. Iohn. 15. c. 20. M. This sharpe persecution of the Christi∣ans in which Iohn suffred many things for the Gospels sake, is thought too haue béene begonne vnder the Emperour Do∣mitian, of whom Orosius in the seuenth booke of his worke intituled the Ormest of the worlde, reporteth thus:The persecu∣tion of the Church vnder Domitian. In the fiue hundred and thirtie yéeres from the buylding of the Citie of Rome, Domitian the brother of Titus, beyng the nynth from Augustus, succéeded his brother in the Kingdome: who by the space of fiftéene yéeres, grewe leysurely throughe all degrées of wickednesse, vntoo thys poynt, that by gyuing out euery where commissions of most cruell persecution, he durst plucke downe Christes Churche which was become verye strong through all the whole world. He fell too so great pride, that he proclaymed himselfe Lord, and commaunded men too call him, wryte him, and honour him as God. Of the no∣blest of the Senate (partly for enuie & partly for lucre sake) some he put openly too death, and some he sent away into ex∣ile, and there commaunded them too bée murthered, &c. And for the witnessing of Iesu Christ. A. That is to say, for the Gos∣pel, which is worthily called a witnessing, according as is said afore in the second verse. 10. I vvas in the Spirit vpon a Sunday, and I herde at my backe a great voyce as it had beene of a Trum∣pet. I was in the spirite. G. Héere foloweth the first vision,Of beeing in the spirit. where∣in Iohn saythe he was in the Spirit. A. Like as Luke repor∣teth of the Apostles Peter and Paule. Acts. 10. b. 10. &. 22. d. 17. G. And Iohn declareth expressely the happening of this thing vnto him, to the end that we may vnderstand how this Reue∣lation surmounteth the vnderstanding of the fleshe.The vse of the Sunday. Vpon a Sunday. S. This was a méete tyme for a heauenly vision. For the same day that Christ returned from death with victorie,
began too bée had in estimation among the Christians: as wherein the congregation was wont too meete togither too heere Gods worde, too pray, and too gréete one another with peace. Therefore when Iohn could not bée bodily present in the holy assemblies: yet notwithstanding (after the example of Dauid) he was present with them all the while in spirit, and powred out his prayers for the Churche, in that waste wyldernesse as it had béene in a temple. Euen then there∣fore when he was wholly occupyed in holye communication with God, and was wholly rauished out of himselfe, he was most méete for heauenly Reuelations. Wée reade that the lyke thing befell vntoo Daniell when he was prisoner in Babilon Dani. 7.The vse of the Iewishe Sabboth. a. 1. And the sunday putteth vs in mind of the christian libertie, in as much as it was the day of Christs resurrection which made an end of the shadowes of the law. M. for like as by the appoyntment of the lawe, the Saboath was solemnized too kéepe in minde the creation of the world: euen so nowe wée vse the Sunday too renew the remēbrance of Christes resurrection and thereby too confirme the hope of our resurrection too come. But when this putting in of the Sunday in sted of the Sabbat day was first done, we haue it not expressed in holy Scripture. G. Neuerthelesse we gather hereby, that the faythfull had alwayes a certeyne daye too re∣pose themselues in. Not for that the seruice of God consis∣teth in ydlenesse, but bicause it is to the maintenance of com∣mon concorde, too haue some certeine day appoynted for ho∣lye assemblyes, séeyng that they cannot bee had dayly. M. Neither are we therfore to be blamed as obseruers of dayes and times, (as the Galathians were) as who should say wée estéemed one day holier than another: for our méeting vpon that day rather than vpon any other, is onely for orders sake, and for a certeine discipline in the Churche. But Paule fin∣deth faulte with those that eyther called againe the Iewishe feastes, or which (after the heathenish fashiō) obserued the E∣giptiā or Mathematicall dayes. And I heard at my back a great
voyce. G.Why Gods voyce is sayd to be greate. It is no maruell thoughe this voyce bée called greate, for it is the voyce of the great and almyghtie God. And it is sayde too bée lyke the noyse of a Trumpette, by∣cause it was the messenger of warre betwéene the King∣dome of Christ and Antichrist, betwéene the shéepe & the wol∣ues, between the chosen & the castawayes, & betwéene ye godly & the vngodly. Besides this, forasmuch as mēs wits be dul to perceiue Gods mysteries: they had néede of a liuely and ef∣fectuall voyce to quicken them vp. Considering also that this Reuelation ought too bée highly estéemed, and that the thing which was to be declared, was of very great importance: too the intent it mighte bée of the more authoritie, it was too bée published by the sounde of a Trumpet, like as the Proclama∣tions of Princes bée. 11. Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. And vvhat thou seest vvrite in a booke, and sende it too the seuen Churches that are in Asia: to Ephesus, and Smirna, and Pergamus, and Thyatira, and Sardis, and Philadelphia, and Laodicea. Saying, I am Alpha and Omega. A. Thou hast the beginning of this verse expounded already in the eight verse heretofore. That which thou seest wryte in a booke.Wherefore Gods Pro∣phets are cō∣maunded to write. Wheras Iohn is war∣ned by the voyce to giue héede to the vision, and to write it in a booke: thereby is betokened the dulnesse and weaknesse of mans wit too conceiue Gods secretes: and that we cannot so much as once thinke of them, (and muche lesse vnderstande them) till we be put in mind of them. A. Also Iohn is cōman∣ded to write these things in a booke: to the end that the things which he saw, myght doo some good too those that come after, and that the faithfull might take matter of comfort thereat: like as in old time the Prophetes were commaunded too put certeine things in writing to the continuall comforte of the faithful. Of which matter sée Esai. 8. a. 1. and Ieremie. 30. a. 2.
And sende them too the seuen Churches that are in Asia.Whatsoeuer God speaketh to anye one Churche is common to al Wée haue tolde you alreadie, that although Iohn were commaun∣ded by the Lord, too send this prophesie to the seuē Churches of Asia: Yet was it written for the common edifying & com∣fort of ye whole Church vniuersall. Whereby also it came to passe through Gods prouidence, that ye noble monument is come euen vnto vs, when notwithstanding it is wel ynough knowen, that manie of the writings of the Prophets and A∣postles are perished from vs by Gods iust iudgement. To E∣phesusEphesus. &c. A. These bée the names of the seuen Churches of Asia, the lesse. Ephesus was the Mother citie of ye lesser Asia, and a famous mart-town, builded by the Amazones, the no∣blest of all the Cities of Ionia, taking that name of a woman of Amazonie, and before that time termed by manye other names, as Vrichia, Ortygia, Ptelea, and Arsinoe after the name of Arsinoe the wyfe of King Lysimachus.The temple of Diana. In this Ci∣tie was that right renoumed temple of Diana, full two hun∣dred yeares in building by all Asia. In that Citie did Paule preache the Gospell of Christ, Act. 18. e. 19. And he wrate a ve∣rie goodly Epistle too the faithfull of that place. And Smyrna,Smyrna. This was the famousest Citie of all Ionia by the recorde of Plinie in his fifth booke and nine & twentie Chapter, and of Strabo in his fourtéenth booke. This worde Smyrna soun∣deth as muche as Myrrhe. And Pergamus,Pergamus. which signifyeth highnesse or haultinesse. It was the noblest Citie of al Asia, yea and of Troade it selfe, through which runneth the ryuer Silenus, and by it runneth the riuer Cetius, whiche issueth out of the mountayne Pindasus, as Plinie wryteth in hys fifth booke & thirtie chapter. Of this Citie wryteth also Stra∣bo in his thirtéenth booke of Geographie. And Thyatira.Thyatira. It is a Citie of Lydia which is a shyre of Asia the lesse, the ha∣bitation of the Macedones, and called of some the last Citie of the Mysians. This woorde Thyatir betokeneth the strong fume or Sacrifyce of labour or paynefulnesse. Looke Acts. 16. c. 14. And Sardis.Sardis. This Sardis (which is as much to saye as
a Prince of pleasantnesse, or a song of myrth, or that which is the remnant or leauings of a thing, or in the Syrian lan∣guage, a Cauldron) A. was also another Citie, whose situati∣on is notwithstanding vnknowen. And Philadelphia.Philadelphia. That is too saye, brotherly loue, or the loue of brotherhood. It is a Citie of Decapolis, accordyng too Plinie in his fifth booke and eyghtéenth Chapter, and accordyng too Strabo in hys sixtéenth booke. It is called in Hebrewe Rabbath, that is too saye, Great, and the Citie of waters, bycause the head of the ryuer Iabok springeth there. And Laodicea.Laodicea. Thys Ci∣tie standeth in the lesser Asia not farre from Hierapolis and Colossus. Of this Citie were the Laodiceans, of whome Paule hath spoken somewhat Coloss. 4. d. 13. d. 16. And thys woorde Laodicea signifyeth by interpretation a rightuous people. Thus muche concerning the names of the seuen Churches of Asia, vnto which, Iohn did write. 12. And I turned backe to see the voyce that spake vvith mee: And vvhen I vvas turned backe, I savve se∣uen golden candlestickes. And I turned backe too see the voyce that spake wyth mee.What is ment by seeing. S. After the Hebrewe phrase, To see is put for too vnderstande or too heere, For a voyce is not séene, but herde. So reade wée in Moses, The people sawe the voyces, Exodus. 20. c. 18. onlesse anye man had leauer too referre thys séeyng vn∣too hym that vttered the voyce: as if Iohn shoulde saye, I turned mée aboute too sée him that vttered this great voyce, so as the effected shoulde bée put for the cause. And when I was turned backe, I sawe seuen golden Candlestickes.Golden Candlesticks. What is ment by the seuen Candlestickes, Christ hymselfe appea∣ring in the Angell, wyll expound in the twentith verse of this Chapter.
13. And in the middes of the seuen golden Candle∣stickes, one like the sonne of man, clothed vvith a long garment dovvne to the feete, and girded at the pappes vvith a golden girdle. And in the middes of the seuen golden candlestickes. G S. That Christ is the middes of the seuen golden Candlestickes,Christes pre∣sence and ope∣ration in his church, wher∣of he is head. that is too saye, of the Churches, betokeneth nothing else but that he saueth them, mainteineth them, instructeth thē, ruleth them, & watcheth ouer them: according as he hath promised that he will be in the middes of the Godlie, euen vnto the ende of the worlde. Math. 18. c. 20. &. 28. d. 20. And therefore of all things that are doone in the Churche, Chryst is not only a beholder but also the iudge: too whom onely it belongeth too rule and gouerne the Churche which he hath purchased with his own blud. For he hathe in such wyse committed the charge therof too the Apostles and other ministers of his woord, as in the meane while hée him selfe continueth the onely Redéemer, and shepehearde of oure soules. 1. Peter. 2. d. 25. That is too saye (as it is sayde in Hebrues. 13. d. 20.) the greate shepe∣herde of all, and the prince of shepherdes. 1. Pet. 5. b. 4. And therfore he did put Peter in mynd of his charge, saying: Féed my lambes, féede my shéepe. Iohn. 21. c. 15. Which thing Pe∣ter did so beare in mynde, that he called the Churche, not his owne flocke, but Christs flock. 1. Peter. 5. a. 2. G. This charge of the Church which Christ taketh vpon him, was shadowed in olde tyme in the law, when the charge of the candlesticke and of the seuen lampes was committed too the high préest. Exo. 35.The duetie of ministers. b. 14. A Wherby we lerne, that the gouernment of the Churche perteyneth only too Christ: so that as many as are ministers in the same, muste bée at his becke, and beware that they of their owne head enioyne not the Churches any thing which Christ hath not allowed. Héerevpon come these speeches of the Apostles: let a man so esteme vs as the mini∣sters of Christ, and disposers of the secretes of God. 1. Cor. 4.
a. 1. And, That which I deliuered vntoo you, I receiued of the Lorde. 1. Cor. 11. e. 23. Also, Wée are not lordes of your faith, 2. Corin. 1. d. 24. Ageyne, ye knowe what commaundemen∣tes I gaue you by our Lord Iesus. 1. Thess. 4. a. 2. Also, there is but one lawgiuer, who is able to saue & to destroy. Iames 4. c. 12. Also, if any man speake, let him speake as the woordes of God. 1. Pet. 4. c. 11. Also, not as executing lordship ouer the Clergie. 1. Pet. 5. a. 3. and suche other things lyke these. Whereby it appéereth manifestly, by howe cruell and tray∣terous tyrannie the Pope hath chalenged to himselfe the go∣uernement of the Church,The Popes traiterousnes in vsurping supremacie ouer the Church. boasting that he maye determyne what he listeth at his owne pleasure. And euen yet at this day, some maruell still that wee call him Antichryst, and the sonne of perdition, though he not only haue made himselfe e∣quall with Chryst the sonne of God, but also proudely pre∣ferred himself afore him. For to desire too sit in the middes of the Churche as iudge, ruler, and commaunder of it: what else is it, than to thrust Christe from oute of the midd of the se∣uen Golden Candelstickes? But of these matters wée will speake more at large héereafter. Like to the sonne of man.Why Christe is sayd to be lyke the sonne of man. This is Chryst the onely mediatour between God and men. 1. Tim. 2. b. 5. and our aduocate or spokesman to the father. 1. Iohn. 2. a. 1. S.G. He is sayde to be lyke the sonne of man, to be∣token the truenesse or verynesse of humane nature in him, with the same fygure of spéeche that Paule vsed, saying: He became lyke vnto men, and was found in apparel as a man, whiche shape truly he tooke vpon him, abasyng himself, wher∣as he was God. Philip. 2. a. 7. G. for he was made of the seede of Dauid, as touching the fleshe. Rom. 1. a. 3. and became like his brothers in all things, sauing sinne. Heb. 2. d. 17. &. 4. d. 15. A. In respect wherof he is called the sonne of man, that is too say, verie man, lyke as he is called the sonne of God, that is to saye, verie God, least any man might imagine that he had an heauenly bodie, as some heretikes do,The error of them that de∣me Christe to haue taken fleshe of the virgin Mary which ground them selues vppon this text of Sainct Pauls. 1. Cor. 15. f. 17. the first
man is of the earth, earthie, the seconde man is the Lorde from heauen. M. for too the end too make the matching of con∣traries fully perfect: they hold opinion, that the same sentence must bée layd forth in this wise: like as the first man had hys bodie made of the earth: so the second man (I méene Christ) brought his bodie with him from heauen. Héervppon Valen∣tine, Marcion, G. Manichie, and M. in our dayes Swinkfeld, with their hangers on, agrée not that Christ took flesh of the Virgin Marie, but say that he brought his bodie from heuen. C. But they mystake Paul to speake of Christs body, where as he rather treateth of the indowmēt or qualitie of his body. Although then that the firste man hadde an immortall soule whiche was not taken of the earth: yet did hée sauour of the earth, wherout of his bodie was taken, and wherin hée was placed to liue. But Chryst hath brought vs the quickening spirite from heauen, to beget vs agayne to a better lyfe, and to a lyfe that is farre aboue the earth. Finally by Adam wée haue to liue in this worlde, as braunches from the roote: but Chryst is the beginning & author of a heauenly lyfe. M. The Apostles méening therefore is nothing else, but yt Adam was the resemblance of this our present lyfe: & that the latter mā (I meane Chryst) is the representation of the lyfe to come, whiche we looke for. Neither doth Paule make mention of a bodie in the sayd text: but rather when hée had sayde, that the firste man was of the earth, earthye, hée added, And the seconde man is the Lorde from heauen. The Godlie denye not but Christ is from heauen, in asmuche as they acknow∣ledge his Godhead: but yet it followeth not therefore, that whatsoeuer the Lorde that came from heauen had, the same should eyther bée of heauenly Nature, or else brought from heauen. For if we will reason after the same maner concer∣ning the first Adam: we shall not say he is altogether of the earth, earth, earthly: consydering that besydes his bodie, hée had also a soule, which is a diuine thing, and was not taken out of the slime of the earth. So then, wée must thinke, that
lyke as Adam not only had a bodie made of claye, but also a heauenly soule: Euen so Chryst not only compriseth the na∣ture of the godhead which came frō heauen, but also the flesh∣ly bodie which he tooke of earth in the womb of the Virgin. Clothed with a long garment down to the feete. The old Inter∣preter hath kept still the Gréek wordeA garment verye like the Aulb of our late Mas-priestes. What is be∣tokened by the long roabe. podêre, which must be pronoūced long in the last sillable sauing one, & it signifieth a long garmēt down to the foot, of the word , which betoke∣neth to put iust or close to a thing, bicause it meteth iust with the féete. M. And proprely it is a Priestes garment, S. where∣by is betokened the priestly purenesse and innocencie, and the victoriousnesse of our king Chryste. Of bothe these dignities wée haue recordes in the Psalms. 2. b. 6. and. 110. a. 4. Concei∣uing his singular innocencie, yée haue, in Hebr. 7. d. 27. and 1. Pet. 2. d. 22. B. and of his victoriousnesse in the Psalm. 2. b. 9. &. 110. b. 6. A. & Esai. 11. a. 4. &. Hebr. 10. c. 13. And girded at the pappes. S.What is mēt by a golden swoordgyrdle, and by beeyng gyrded. A swoordgirdle decked with golde is a souldiorlyke furniture, wherby is wont to be betokened stoutnesse in exe∣cuting ones charge, so as he doth nothing coldly & slouthfully. So Chryst also in many places of the Scripture is auouched to be a stout chāpion in reskuing his people out of the handes of his aduersarie power. Lyke as when it is sayd, Girde thy swoorde vppon thy thyghe, O thou moste myghtie. Psalme 45. a. 4. Also, The Lorde reigneth and is clothed with maie∣stie, the Lorde clothed and girded with power. Psal. 93 a. 1. Also, And Iustice shall bée the girdle of his loynes, and faith∣fulnesse the buckle of his reynes. Esai. 11. a. 5. For by his Iu∣stice he deliuereth suche as are oppressed with violence, from the myghtyer sorte: accordyng as it is sayde, He shall de∣lyuer the poore that cryeth, and the poore that hath no hel∣per. Psalme. 72. c. 12. And by thys faythfulnesse and truth, hée perfourmeth the benefites that he hathe promised to the faithful. A. For he is faithfull of his promise. After the same maner also clotheth he his disciples from aboue with power, that is too wit, with heauenly armour. Luke. 24. g. 49. & Act. 1.
b. 8. Also he wylleth them too bée gyrded, that is too saye, too go through lustily with their charge of preaching the Gospel. Let your loynes (sayth he) bée gyrded, and your lampes bur∣ning in your hands. &c. Luke. 12. e. 35. by which words he mea∣neth that the champions of the Gospell should bée, not onely stoute & corageous, but also forecasting and circumspect, that they maye espie in dew tyme, on what side the enemie is to bée striken. So also dothe Paule furnishe a Christian Soul∣dyer with a swordgirdle. Stande ye (saythe he) with your loynes girded in truth. Eph. 6. c. 14. that is too say, do nothing fearefully and too the eye: but doo all things truely and from the hart, yea and stoutly too. 14. And his head and his heare vvas vvhite as vvhite VVooll, and as Snovv: and his eyes [vvere] as a flame of fire. Christe is the euerlastyng wysedome of the father.And his heade. A. He procéedeth in describing the shape of him that talked with him: and he saythe his heare was as white as Wooll. S. Holy and reuerend Horeheadednesse pre∣tendeth wisedome gotten by long experience of things. It see∣meth therefore that hereby is betokened the euerlastingnesse of Christ our sauiour, by reason of the Godhead annexed vn∣to him. For he is the euerlasting fathers purpose, wisedome, and power, in the beginning with God, Iohn. 1. a. 2. which he possessed in the beginning of his wayes by which he made all things. Prouerb. 8. c. 22. In respect whereof Christ is called the auncient of dayes in the Prophet Daniel. 7. c. 9. who be∣ing in the fathers bosome, hath vttered him vnto vs: Iohn. 1. c. 18. and he himselfe beareth witnesse of himselfe, saying: before Abraham was made, I am, Iohn. 8. g, 58. And Paule termeth him the first begotten of all creatures. Colos. 1. b. 15. Rightly therfore, as wel bycause of the Heretikes that denie Christ to haue been before Marie was: as also bycause the father hath giuen all power too the Sonne, whom he hath or∣deined iudge of the quicke and the dead: Iohn describeth him
reuerend for his holy horeheadnesse & much wisedome: that is to say, excelling in long experience of things according as it is sayd, In auncientnesse there is wisedome, and skilful∣nesse in long time. Iob. 12 b. 12. G. Christ then is not subiect to the deceiuablenesse of men, according as some light and vn∣constant iudges of this world be,The witnesse of true Chri∣stians. who for want of experience may easly bée deceiued, yea and also corrupted. A. Wherevp∣on, the scepter also that is attributed to this our King, is cal∣led the scepter of rightnesse, Psal. 45. b. 6. As white VVoll. P.M. Ther be that in this place refer Christes white heare to such as are whited by baptisme, whiche come like shéepe out of a washing place. M.. And also bycause that like as white wooll is apt to receiue what coloures a man will: so the Sainctes are apt to receiue any manner of tribulations. But like as the first exposition is the simpler, so agréeth it the better with the text. And as Snow. G. For asmuch as all men haue not the like measure of faythe: héere is added, not only the similitude of wooll, but also of snow. For like as the word of the Lord is to some men milke, and to othersome substantiall meate: euen so vnto some it is as fayre and white as wooll, and to other∣some as snow: for otherwise, to the vnbeléeuers and vngodly it séemeth vtterly blacke, according as it is the sent of deathe vnto death. 2. Cor. 2. d. 16. And his eyes were as a flame of fyre. S. The resemblance of an angry iudge is wont to be diuersly de∣scribed in the Psalmes and Prophets,The descrip∣tion of Christ in the person of an angrie iudge. and most commonly by fyre, both for the feercenesse of fire, which he is said to haue vsed oftentimes in executing his iudgements against the re∣probates: and also bycause we sée as it were certayne sparks of fire flashing from the eyes of such as be enraged, whyther it be of men or of beasts. Herevpon Dauid sayth: Ther went vp a smoke in his anger, and fyre burned at his face, Psal. 18. a. 7. Also the countenance of the Lorde is vppon them that do euil, to roote out the remembrance of them from the earth, Psal. 34. c. 16. Euen so is Christe described in this place as it were kindled on fire with anger, against ye persecutors of his
Church, with his eyes glaring out in flames of fyre for dis∣pleasure: after which sort also he is brought in by ye prophet. His eyes (sayth he) are as burning Cressets. Dani. 10. a. 6. A. And nothing ought to encourage all godly folke more vnto patience, than when they perceiue themselues to haue so fa∣uorable a iudge, that he will take horrible vengeance of their enimies. 15. And his feete vvere like vnto fyne brasse, as it vvere burnign in a furnace: and his voyce [vvas] as the noyse of many vvaters. And his feete were lyke fyne brasse. A. The old translater hath translated it, like to Golden brasse.Golden brasse. E. But the gréeke word that Iohn hath vsed, is compounded of Incense and brasse, as if a man should terme it Incensebrasse.What is beto∣kened here by feete of In∣censebrase or Amberbrasse. Suidas reporteth it to be a kind of Amber more preciouse than Gold, and he saythe it is made of Glasse and stone, auouching the table of the greate Churche (as he tearmeth it) to haue bin made of the same stuffe. Plinie in the four and thirtith booke and second chap∣ter of his story of the worlde, auoucheth it to be a kinde of brasse, digged out of the veynes of the earth, which was had in estimation in old time. G. And these feete séeme to betoken Christes works, which being in all respects pure and vnre∣prouable,The greate Charitable∣nesse of Chri∣stes woorkes. might rauish all men to haue them in wonderfull admiration. As it were burning in a furnace. A. Othersome reade as it were in a burning furnace. But the word burning is more rightly applyed to the féete, so as we may vnderstand that his féete burned or were on fire: that is to say, that Chrystes workes procéeded of singular heate of charitie. For we learne by the holy story of the Gospell, with how greate cheerefulnesse and earnestnesse of mynd, he perfourmed the thynges that perteyned to our saluation. For when Peter counseled him from going vp to suffer at Ierusalem, he sayde vnto him: Come behynd me Sathan, thou art a hindrance to
me, for thou sauerest not the things that are of God, but the thyngs that are of men. Math. 16. d. 23. And, I haue a baptim to be baptised withall, and how and I distressed, till it be o∣uer? Luke. 12. g. 50. Also, the zele of thy house hath eaten me vp. Iohn. 2. c. 17. Besides this, he went about with greate earnestnesse of mynd, from Citie to Citie, and from towne to towne, teaching in theyr Synagogs, and preaching the glad tydings of the kingdome, and healing all sicknesses and diseases among the people, Math. 9. d. 35. C.S.The voyce of the Gospell, and the migh∣tie power thereof. Iohn séemeth to allude to the vision which is reported in Ezechiel. 1. b. 4. And his voyce was as the noyse of many waters. S. Gods voyce is nowe and then lykened to vehement and dreadfull thunde∣rings, like as in the Psalm. 18. b. 14. and .29. a. 3. to set foorthe the maiestie of so great a king. According also as the power and operation of preaching the Gospell, whiche should take effect with al the nations and languages of the whole world, is described in this place: so as it is compared to the noyse of many waters rushing togyther with violence: whereof Chryst himselfe sayth in Iohn: He that beléeueth in me as the Scripture saythe, streames of water shall flowe out of hys belly. Iohn. 7. f. 38. And thys thyng he hath vttered more openly and withoutWithout be∣rowed or figu∣ratiue speech. metaphor in another place. I (sayth he) wyll gyue you mouth and wisedome which all your aduer∣saries shall not be able to withstand. Luke. 21. c. 15. whiche thyng we reade to haue bin fulfilled vnder the Apostles. For with great power did they beare record of the resurrecti∣on of our Lord Iesus, and greate grace was vpon them all. Actes. 4. g. 33. Suche truely was the voyce, that threw downe Paule to the grounde, (euen when he was busiest in perse∣cuting, and when he breathed out manaces and slaughter a∣gainst the Lordes disciples,) by saying to him, Saule Saule why persecutest thou me. Act. 9. a. 4.
16. And he had in his right hand seuen Starres, and out of his mouth vvent a sharpe tvvoo edged svvorde, and his face shone euen as the Sunne in his strength. Godly tea∣chers.And he had in his ryght hande. A. By these seuen Starres, are betokened the ministers of the Church, according as shall bée sayd in expresse woordes hereafter in the twentie verse, whych thing is easye too bée gathered by the prophesie of Da∣niell, for thus saythe he. They that vnderstande shall shyne as the brightnesse of the firmament: and they that instructe many vnto righteousnesse, shall shine as the starres for euer and euer.Gods ryghte hande. Dan. 12. a. 3. Moreouer, the Right hād is wont in the scripture, to betoken the strength and power whereby God worketh all things effectually: as, The righte hande of the Lord hath done mightily. Psa. 118. c. 16. Therefore, concerning the ministers of the Church whiche Christ our Lord sendeth to englighten the same with the brightnesse of his heauenly light,The safenesse and suretie of Gods mini∣sters. (that is to say, to endue it with the doctrine of fayth vn∣to saluation,) He holdeth them in his right hād: that is to say, he guideth them himselfe, he speaketh and worketh all things in them himselfe, and he sheeldeth and defendeth them hym∣selfe: according as it is said, Be not afrayd of their looke, least I happen to breake thée in péeces before their faces: for be∣hold, I haue set thée this day as a fortifyed Citie, and as a pil∣ler of yron, and as a brazen wall agaynst all the land of Iu∣da, against the kings, the princes, the préestes, and the peo∣ple of the Realme. And truly they shal fyght against thée, but they shall not preuayle against thee, bycause I am with thée to deliuer thée sayth the Lord. Ier. 1. d. 18. And the Lord sayde in a vision vnto Paule: Feare not: but speake, and holde not thy peace: for I am with thee, and no man shall lay hands on thee to do thée harme. Act. 18. c. 9. G. Séeing then that Christe hath the ministers of the Church in his owne hand, to sende them whither soeuer he listeth: faithfull shepeherds must be sought for and looked for at his hand, and not at mans wise∣dome.
A. Desire the Lord of the haruest (saith he) to thrust out haruest folke into his haruest. Math. 9. d. 38. M. Furthermore the ministers of the word are warned héere,The conuer∣sation of god∣lie ministers. that séeing they be adorned with so notable a title of commendation, they should giue themselues to purenesse of lyfe, & lyke as starres are séene a farre off vpon the earth: euen so their life shoulde not sauor of the earthe, but of heauen: wherevnto also they must bring others that are committed to their charge. And herevnto belong those exhortations of Paule to Timothie and Titus: Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou a pat∣terne to the faithful, in word, in conuersation, in louingnesse, in spirit, in fayth, and in chastitie. 1. Timo. 4. d. 12. And in all things shew thy selfe a pattern of good works, with soundnes of doctrine, sobernesse, wholsome talke, which is vnblamable &c. Tit. 2. b. 7. Peter also chargeth the elders of the Churche that they shoulde be patternes of the flocke. 1 Pet. 5. a. 3. But what the lyfe and conuersation of those is, whiche in these dayes vaunt themselues for byshops of the Church, it is néed∣lesse to say: considering that euen children are able to beare witnesse, howe their fylthynesse hathe stayned the whole world.The conuer∣sation of the Popish ministers. In déede they snatch to themselues these goodly titles whych the scripture attributeth vnto faithfull shepeherds: they boast themselues to be the starres of heauen, the lyght of the world, the salt of the earth, the successors of Christ and hys Apostles, the pillers of the Church, the maisters of the world, and all that may be: in somuch as they chalenge the name of the Churche to themselues only and to their shauelings. But when they come to the proofe: a man shall finde them to be, not starres of heauen, but staynes: not light, but darknesse: not salt, but sand: not shepherds, but shéepebyters & woolues which spare not the Lords flocke, but cloth themselues wyth the wooll of hys shéepe,Christes mouthe. and afterwarde destroy the shéepe themselues with their wicked forgeries. For they be blinde, and guydes of the blind. Math. 15. b. 14. And out of his mouth went a sharpe two edged sworde. G. Christes mouth are the
Prophets, Apostles, & all ministers of Gods word, in whome he speaketh by his spirit,Christs swoord. according as it is to be read in. 2. Cor. 13. a. 3. &. 2. Peter. 1. d. 21. And by the word Sword, the scrip∣tures are wont to betoken the power whereby his enimies are put to flight. Nothing is more commendable and prayse worthy in a prince, than the sword, if he vse it lawfully: lyke as it is said in the Psalm. 45. a. 4. &. Rom. 13. b. 4. G. But héere, by the tearme sword, is meant the pure word of God: wherof Paule writeth thus: Take vnto you the helmet of saluation and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. Ephe. 6. c. 17. A. Like as by this sword all the godly are defended, so as no man can hurt them, so by the same the vngodly be de∣stroyed. Which thing is easy to be gathered by Esay. 11. a. 4. & 2. Thess. 2. b. 8. This is the sword whiche Christ auoucheth himselfe to haue sent into the earth, to set diuision betwixt the father and the sonne, the mother and the daughter, and the daughter in law and the mother in law. Math. 10. d. 34. 35. And it is sayd to be twoedged,Twoedged. bycause the word of God must (without any respect of persons) be preached vnto all men, kings, princes, and commons, that it may deuide the spirite from the soule, and discouer euen the very thoughts of them, according as the Apostle sheweth notably. Heb. 4. c. 12. And his face shone euen as the sonne in his strength.Christs face or countenāce. Like as men be knowen by their faces, so is Christ knowen by his word: namely that he is our true aduocate and attonement maker with God, the shepeherd and bishop of our soules, the light of the world, the bread of lyfe, the way, truth, and lyfe, and to be short, the only he that can saue vs for euer. S. This face of hys is not vnfitly likened to the pleasantnesse of the noonelyght. A. For euen such a one doth he shew himselfe to his seruants, when he reskeweth them from the power of darknesse, rid∣deth them out of the hande of their oppressors, and maintey∣neth their welfare. For then is the blacke storme chaced away, and the weather shyneth faire, and then is the darke night turned into the cléere light of the day. Suche a coun∣tenance
of Christ did his disciples behold vpon the mountaine Math. 17. a. 2. Such a one did Dauid wishe to shine vpon him when he sayd, Lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs O Lord. Psa. 4. b. 6. &. 31. c. 16. S. But he appéereth contrariwise to the vngodly, as I haue sayd already in the fourtenth verse. Wherevpon it is sayd in the Prophet, His face was as light∣ning. Dan. 10. a. 6. For although lightning be bright: yet is it not chéerefull, but rather abasheth men. Euen so when the Lord had made an end of the captiuitie of the Iewes, and brought them home agayne into the land of promis: the lyght of the Sonne séemed seuen folde greater and pleasanter than before. Esay. 30. f. 26. for when men droope in sorowe and anguish of harte, not euen the sunne seemeth for to shyne. 17. And vvhen I savve him, I fell dovvne at hys feete as dead. Then he layde his right hand vpon me, saying vnto me. Be not afrayde, I am the first and the last. And when I saw him. S.G.Mans weak∣nesse in the presence of God. Héereby it appéereth howe greate the weaknesse of man is, whyche is not able to abyde Gods presence any whyle at all, vnlesse it bée stayed and vphilde by the power of GOD. L. And héerevppon commeth the shuddering and amazednesse wherewith the Scripture euery where auoucheth the holy men to haue bin striken and abashed, as oft as they perceyued God to be pre∣sent. Now when we sée those which in Gods absence stoode carelesse and stedfast, to be so shaken and abashed at the disco∣uering of his glory, as they be swallowed vp with the terror of death, and in a maner quite fordone: it is to be gathered ther∣by, that man is neuer throughly touched and tamed with the acknowledgement of his owne bacenesse, til he haue matched himselfe with the maiestie of God. And of this abashment we haue rise examples both in the Iudges and in the Prophets:
insomuche as it was taken vp for a common woorde among the people of God. Wée shall die bycause wée haue séene the Lorde. Iudg. 13. d. 22. A. For howe should a man be able to stande before the maiestie of him, that holdeth and ruleth heauen and earth in his hand? Or what should rottēnesse and wormes meate doe, sith the very Cherubins are fayn to hide their faces for feare? Esai. 6. a. 2. A. No maruell then though Iohn be afrayd at the presence of Gods maiestie, & fall down at his féete for dead. B. Wée reade the same thing to haue be∣falne to Esaye, Ezechiell, and Daniell. Es. 6. b. 5. Ezech. 1. g. 28. & Dan. 10. c. 15. And too the disciples vppon the Mounte. Math. 17. a. 6. S. Nowe if the godlie bée not able too awaye wyth his gentle countenaunce: howe shall the wicked bée withoute feare at the syghte of him, when hée is an angrye iudge.Gods right hand, helpe, or cheerfulnese. Then he layd his ryght hande vppon mee. G.M. Héere his ryght hande is taken for helpe, as it is in Iob. 14. c. 15. and in the Psalmes. 138. b. 8. and. 139. b. 10. S. As if Iohn should say, the ryght hande of his power restored mée my strength whi∣che was appalled with feare, and set vp vpon my feete: and he did rid me of the fearefulnesse wherewith I was stricken, speaking gently vntoo mée. Saying to mee. Except the Lorde speake vnto vs, and chéere vs vp with his woord, we shal ne∣uer be ridde from feare and terrour. Be not afrayde. G. Be not abashed, lette not thy hearte shrinke, plucke vp a good cou∣rage, and take good héede to the things that I shall say. A. So also when Christes Apostles lay flatte vppon the grounde, hée sayd to them: Aryse, and bée not afrayde. Math. 17. b. 7. I am the first and the last. B. Heere again thou hast an assured re∣corde of Christs godhead. S. And truly our Lord Christ is coe∣ternall with the heauenly father: and like as he is the begin∣ning of beeing vntoo all things, so dooth he finish & chaunge all things, himselfe continuing vtterly vnchangeable, according as the Apostle doth trimly conuey it in expounding this place to be mente of Chyrste. And thou Lorde haste founded the earthe in the beginning. &c. Psal. 102. d. 22. & Hebrues. 1. c. 10.
P. The first then is Christ: for by him were all things made, and without him was nothing made that was made. Iohn. 1. a. 3. And he is the last, bycause all things are repayred agayne in him. Ephe. 1. b. 10. & Coloss. 1. c. 20. Iohn hath borowed thys spéech out of Esay. 41. b. 4. &. 44. a. 6. &. 48. b. 12. 18. And vvhich am aliue, And I vvas dead, and be∣hold I am aliue for euermore. Amen. And I haue the keyes of Hell and of death. And whiche am aliue. A.Christe vn∣uanquished of death. This place sheweth that although Christ were dead, yet was he not quite dispatched by deathe as the Iewes hoped. In respect whereof he sayd, when ye shal haue lifted vp the sonne of man, then shall ye know that I am, Iohn. 8. d. 28. And agayne: when I am lifted vp from the earth, I wyll draw all thynges vnto me. Iohn. 12. e. 32. G. And he is sayd to lyue now: not only bycause he hath lyfe in hym, but also bycause he gyueth lyfe to all things. In consideration whereof he is sayd not only to be alyue, but also to be the lyfe itselfe. Iohn. 1. a. 4. and .14. a. 6. And I was dead. A.Christs dying for vs. Thys can∣not be verefyed of the Angelles, bycause they be inuisible and immortall spirites. S. But Christ, to obey hys father, and to wash away the sinnes of mankynd, was contented to yéelde hymselfe to deathe for a tyme, A. to the intent he myghte at length by deathe destroy hym that had the po∣wer of death, (that is to wit the Diuell) and set them at li∣bertie, which for feare of deathe were subiect to bondage all theyr lyfe long. Hebr. 2. d. 14.15. For euen from the be∣ginning GOD purposed vppon thys sacrifice, wherein Christe the true shepeherd of all men gaue hys lyfe for hys shéepe. Iohn. 10. c. 15.17. G. And lyke as Christe the heade of the Church entered into hys glory by deathe, Luke. 24. d. 26. so becommeth it all the godly to dye wyth hym, that they may bée glorifyed togyther wyth hym, according as Paule teacheth, Rom. 8. d. 17. and .2. Timo. 2 b. 11.12. and. Acts. 14.A comfort ageinst feare of death and all afflictions. d. 22. And beholde I am alyue for euermore. S. q.d. Nowe haue
I vanquished death, and am come agayne to euerlasting life. Death hath no more power ouer me, no man can henceforth take my life from me. A. And thys manner of knitting the words togyther, is to be marked. Euen now when Iohn was abashed at this heauenly vision, he sayd vnto him, be not a∣fraid: and now as it were rendring a cause why he should lay aside feare, he addeth, behold I am aliue for euermore. For it is all one as if he shoulde say, there is no cause why any of mine should be afraid at all: bycause that lyke as I am risen againe and shall neuer die any more, euen so as many as shal be afflicted by Antichrist and the wicked persecuters for my names sake, or punished by sword, famin, imprisonment, or any other tribulation, yet shall they also rise agayne from death, and liue with me world without end. A. So sayd he to his Apostles, ye shall haue oppression in the world, but be of good chéere, for I haue ouercome the world. Iohn. 16. d. 33. P. For in as muche as Christ is the head of the body, he promiseth as∣suredly like hope of rising agayne and of life, vnto all hys members: bycause he cannot be seuered from the Churche. Amen. A. This parcell is added for confirmation of the thyngs that be spokē already.The releasing of sinne belon∣geth only vn∣to Chryst. And I haue the keyes of hell and of death. S. That is to say, I haue the power of forgiuing sin: which be∣ing taken away, both death and hell haue no strength at all. So paule sayth with the Prophet: death is swallowed vp in∣to victory. &c. The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Lawe. Osee. 13. d. 14. and .1. Cor. 15. g. 56. Then dyed he for our offences, and is risen agayne to make vs righteouse, Rom. 4. d. 25. That is to say, that we whiche beleeue may be set frée from our sinnes, so as they may not hurt vs at all. Therefore we gather by this place, that to release sinnes belongeth only vnto Christe. In vayne then goes the Pope about to wrest these keyes out of Christes hande, who ap∣péered to the ende to vndoe the diuels workes. 1. Iohn. 3. a. 8. Wherfore it is he only that hath destroyed death and brought life into the worlde. 2. Timo. 1. c. 10. A. And therefore it is
sayd, Awake thou that sléepest and rise vp from the dead, and Chryst shall enlighten thée. Ephes. 5. c. 14. Also, I am the resurrection and the lyfe: he that beléeueth in me, al∣though he be dead, yet shall he lyue, and euery one that ly∣ueth and beléeueth in me, shall not dye for euer. Iohn. 11. c. 25.26. 19 VVrite the thinges that thou hast seene, and the thynges vvhyche are, and the things vvhich shall be hereafter. VVrite. A.What things this booke conteyneth. To the intent these things myght neuer weare out of minde: Iohn is commaunded to write the thynges whych the Lorde hath disclosed vnto him. The thinges that thou hast seene. A. That is to wit, whiche are already past: namely my passion and resurrection. And the things that are. That is to say, the present troubles and my present ayde. For persecutions raged in the Church, and there were many Antichristes in the worlde. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 18. And the thinges that shall be hereafter. A. That is to wit in the latter times when Antichristes shall raygne openly. Concerning which last tymes, looke. 1. Tim. 4. a. 1. &. 2. Tim. 3. a. 1.2. &. 2. Peter. 2. a. 1. &. 3. a. 3. &. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 18. &. Iude. a. 4. 20. The misterie of the seuen starres vvhiche thou savvest in my right hande, and the seuen golden Can∣dlestickes. The seuen starres are the Angelles of the seuen Churches: and the seuen Candlestickes vvhyche thou savvest are the seuen Churches. The mysterie of the seuen starres. M. To the intent to make Iohn the redyer too execute the worke enioyned vntoo hym: Chryste in hys owne person expoundeth vnto hym the vision aforesayde. A. The olde Interpreter tran∣slated the woorde Mysterye, Sacramente. The seauen starres are the Angelles of the seauen Churches. In thys
place there be but two mysteries of the said reuelation ope∣ned vnto Iohn,Why the mi∣nisters of the Church be called starres and Angelles. as an introduction to the knowledge of the rest: for this reuelation perteyneth chéefly to the Churches, and to the ministers of them. S. Moreouer the ouerséers of Churches are in the scriptures called both starres and An∣gelles. Starres in respect of the brightnesse, both of theyr heauenly doctrine and of their heauenly conuersation, accor∣ding as we haue sayd already in the .16. verse: and Angelles, bycause they reporte vnto vs the wyll of GOD the fa∣ther: according also as in the same respecte Chryste is called the Angell of the Testament. Malachie. 3. a. 1. And Iohn Baptist is called an Angell. Malachie. 3. a. 1. and Math. 11. b. 10. So also in thys place, the rulers of the Churches are called Angelles: whyche thyng appéereth chéeflye héereby, that héereafter in the seconde Chapter and the fifth verse they be willed to repente, whiche thing coulde in no wyse agrée to the heauenly spirites. Therefore lyke as the Starres shyne in the skye, so must the mynisters of Gods worde shyne in the Churche, and go before others in pure∣nesse of doctrine and Christen conuersation. But a greate sorte of them (alas for sorowe) walke as enimies of Chri∣stes Crosse, whose ende is damnation, whose God is theyr bellye, and theyr glorye in shame, whyche séeke after earthlye thynges, when as notwythstanding, theyr conuersation ought too bee heauenly.The Church is likened to a candlestick. Philip. 3. d. 18.19.20. And the seuen Candlestickes whyche thou sawest are the seuen Churches. G. The Churche is lykened to a Candlesticke, bycause the true lyght shyneth in it, whereof all the godly are partakers. A. And therefore Paule calleth the Churche the Piller and groundworke of truthe. 1. Timo. 3. d. 15. Or else Christes Churche is called a Candlesticke, by∣cause there are in it Prophets, Apostles, Euangelistes, Pastoures, and teachers (Ephesians. 4. b. 11.) to gyue lyghte vnto others by the moste wholesome doctrine of Chryste togyther wyth the holynesse of their owne lyfe,
thereby too guide them in their trauelling through the darke∣nesse of this life vnto the heauenly heritage, as as it is sayde, 2. Petr. 1. d. 19. The Church then is as a cresset set vp in a ha∣uen, too shew the hauen a far of too such as wander vpon the déepe sea in the night season. Euen so doth our Sauiour saye of Iohn Baptist, that he was a burning and blasing Cresset, Iohn. 5. c. 35. and vnto his Disciples, you are the lyght of the world. Math. 5. b. 14. By the way it is alwayes too bee mar∣ked, that the faithfull haue not their lyght from else where than at the light of him which sayeth, I am the light of the worlde. Iohn. 8. b. 12. Therefore Christ is fayde too bée in the middes of the seuen Candlestickes, that is too say, of the Chur∣ches: verily too enlighten, preserue, and defend them,Why the Churches be likened to golden candle∣sticks. accor∣ding as hath béen saide in the .xiij. verse. And they bee called golden Candlestickes, bycause that they themselues doe hold and (by the power and working of the holy Ghost) do drippe into mens hartes, the most pure, plaine, and naturall vnder∣standing of faith, (that is too wit concerning God, concerning the true Godhead and the true māhood of Christ, concerning true Religion, concerning true righteousnesse, & consequent∣ly concerning the atteinement of endlesse saluation) out of the wordes both of Christ and the Prophetes, purged from all deuices and inuntions of men, as it were golde fyned in the fire and burning with the heate of charitie. The wordes of the Lord (sayth Dauid) are pure words, euen as siluer try∣ed in the fyre, seuen tymes purged of the Lord of the earth, Psalm. 12. b. 7. In the middes of this euill: and frowarde go∣neration, shyne you like lampes in the worlde, holding fast the worde of lyfe. Philip. 2. b. 15.16. Besides this, the Church is compared with Golde. which is the preciousest of all Me∣tals, too the ende wée may knowe, that althoughe shée be de∣spysed in the syght of the worlde, yet is shée most deere vntoo God. A. For, for loue of hir, he spared not hys only begotten Sonne, who also hath giuen himselfe for hir, too sanctifye and clense hir by his worde in the lauer of water, that he
myght make hir a glorious Churche too himselfe, wythout spot or wrincle or any such thing, so as shée myght bée holye and vnreprouable.The maner of the scripture in terming of signes or sa∣craments by the names of the things ye they signie or represent. Ephe. 5.26.27. S. Lastly it is too bée mar∣ked that when the Scripture treateth of things that repre∣sent or resemble other things, it speaketh in such wyse, as it termeth the things that represent, by the names of the things that bée represented. For he sayeth that the Starres are the Angels, and the Candlestickes the Churches. A. What won∣der is it then, if wée followe the same forme of spéeche, when wée treate of Sacramentes? For séeyng that Baptime is called the Lauer of newe birth, Titus. 3. b. 5. séeyng that the Rocke whereout of water flowed for the fathers in the wil∣dernesse, is called Christ, 1. Cor. 10. a. 4. séeyng that the Doue is called the Holie Ghost, Iohn. 1. f. 32. no man can geynsaye but that the names of the things that are represented, bée gi∣uen too the things that represent them. Howe commeth it too passe then, that suche as make a conscience in sticking too the Lordes wordes, cannot abyde too haue that thing applyed too the Lordes Supper, whiche is common too all Sacra∣mentes? Are they in loue wyth the simple and litterall sense? And why then shall not the same rule take place in all Sacramentes? Truely vnlesse they graunte that the Rocke was Christ in bodily substance: it is but a péeuishe flaunder wherewith they charge vs. For this rule of spea∣kyng is not forged a late by oure owne selues: but lyke as Austin hath delyuered it ouer by authoritie of the auncient fathers, so doe all of vs imbrace it at hys hande: namely that the names of spirituall things are vnproperly gyuen vntoo the signes that betoken them, and that all places of Scripture where mention is made of Sacramentes ought too bée so expounded.
The second Chapter. WRrite to the Angell of the Churche of Ephe∣sus. Thus saith he that holdeth the seuen Stars in his ryght hand, vvhich vvalketh in the middes of the seuen golden Candlestickes. WRite too the Angell of the Churche of Ephesus.The contents of the seuen Epistles written to the seuen Chur∣ches. A. Now after the sayd former vision, Iohn is commaunded too write the things which the Lorde knewe too bée profitable and néedefull for the Churches. And héere bée set downe seuen Epistles, written too the Ministers of seuen Churches. Of which Epistles, the firste, thirde, and fourth belong too the faythfull that are as yet blame worthie in some poynt: the seconde and sixth belong too such as were blamelesse before the worlde and lyued holily: but the fifth and seuenth are directed too the counterfets and hypocrites. An Angell (that is too say,The definitiō of the worde Angell. a Messenger) is one that is sent of an errand. Whereby wée learne that no man can giue forth Gods woorde purely and profitably, excepte he bée sent of the Lord. Rom. 10. c. 15. P. Iohn had sayd afore in the fourth verse of the former Chapter, that he woulde write too the seuen Churches. That beginneth he nowe too performe, by writing too their Sheepe. For the pastors must not bée seuerall par∣ties from their Churches, séeyng that all of them make but one bodie. A. Wée haue spoken of Ephesus heretofore. 1. c. 11. M. With this Church of Ephesus doth Iohn begin,Amendment and reforma∣tion must be∣ginne at the chiefest heads of ye Church. bycause it was esteemed as chiefe, bothe for the multitude of belée∣uers, and for the renoume of the place. And it was behoofe∣full too make hys beginning at that, too the ende that when that was once amended, he myghte the easlyer prouide for the amendmente and welfare of the reste. And althoughe there were some thyngs amysse both in the Laytie and in the clergie, as they now terme them: yet steppeth he not to ye
laitie, but to the Clergie. Neyther speaketh he to euery one of the clergie by name, but to the chiefe of the Clergie, name∣ly the Bishop, and that not without good cause. For the shep∣herd shall render an account before the soueraigne Iudge, not onely for his owne sinnes, but also for the sinnes of thse that be vnder him, if any of them happen to perish through his negligence or lacke of discretion, according as it is writtē in Ezechiel. 3. e. 20. Againe, like as it is in vayne to séeke for helth, for the other membres, as long as the stomacke is dis∣eased, and therfore first care muste bée had for that: euen so the medicine of reformation muste bée ministred to the shep∣herdes, ere it be ministred too the people. For lyke as the diseased stomacke infecteth the nourishment, wherewith  reste of the membres are reléeued: so is the lyfe of the people marred by the euyll and noysome example of the shephear∣des. S. Howebéeit, by all lykelyhode, it is not any one of the gouernours of the Churche that is betokened in this place, and in the places folowing: but rather héere is to bée accomp∣ted the whole succession of the Byshops and Elders of that Churche, togyther in order one after an other, albeit that the minister of the place oughte alwayes to be reckened as for∣most in the ranke.The mini∣sters of the Church are rued min∣teyned and vphild by Chryst. Thus sayeth he that holdeth the seuen starres in his ryght hande. S. It is a description of Chryst, as it appea∣reth by the premisses. For he hath the Angels of the churches in his ryght hande: that is to saye, he ruleth, maynteyneth, and vpholdeth all Pastors, and ministers of hys woord by his power. For vnlesse he hilde them vp, when others fall, they shoulde fall too: and if hée ruled them not, they should straye wyth the wanderyng starres, of whome mention is made in Iude. c. 13. Looke before in the fyrste Chap∣ter and syxteenth verse.Chrystes care ouer his Church. VVhyche walketh in the myddes of the seauen Golden Candelstickes. S. Hée meaneth by these woordes, that from tyme to tyme hée hathe a care and re∣garde of all thyngs that are sayde and doone in the Church: according to this saying, I will walke amongst you, and I
will be your God, Leuit. 26. b. 12. And I will dwel among you for euer. Ezech. 43. b. 7. c. 9. So also saythe Christ him selfe, wheresoeuer two or thrée bée gathered togither in my name, there am I in the middes of them; Math. 18. c. 20. Also, I am the Lord that searcheth mens hartes and tryeth their reynes Iere. 17. b. 10. A. For if a householder which is but a mortall man, haue a care of his house, and looketh narrowly too the things that be done in it by his household meynie, amending where aught is too be amended, and putting euery of them in mind of his duetie: how should Christ cast of the care of his household, that is too say of the Church, for which he sheaded his bloud? Therfore he walketh in the middes of his church, both a witnesse and a iudge of all things that are done in it, least any man contenting himselfe with coloured holinesse, mighte haue no further desire, but to please men. For wée know what was said to Abraham. Walke thou before mée, and be sound. Genes. 17. a. 1. 2. I knovv thy vvorkes, and thy labour, and thy pa∣cience, and hovve thou canst not beare vvith them that bee euill, and [hovve] thouor tryedst. examineddest suche as say they are Apostles and are not, and hast founde them lyers. I knowe thy workes, and thy labour. S. The Church of Ephe∣sus and the Rulers therof had in them some things worthie praise, and some things also worthie dispraise. Therfore looke what things were worthie praise, he purposeth too aduaunce them with commendation: and looke what were worthie of blame, he will haue them reformed by repentance & amend∣ment of lyfe. M. G. To knowe,To knowe. in this place signifyeth to allow or like of. And by the word workes is ment the charitie and good doyng whereby they serued their neighbours turnes. A. Whervnto he annexeth labour, too the ende we should know that charitie is full of paines taking.Christen and charitable peynfulnesse. According as Paule saithe, God is not vnrightuous that he shoulde forget your
working, & your labor indured for charities sake. &c. •. ¦ly he meaneth that no labour or paines must be spared if w will doo our duetie toward our neighbours. For we must nt onely reléeue them with money, but also with counsell, tr¦uell, and sundry other things. Much diligence therefore is to bée vsed, many troubles are too bée swallowed vp, and man daungers are oftē times to be aduētured. And so, he that will exercise himselfe in the duties of charitie, (C. which thing eue∣rie man ought to do) must buckle himselfe to a plainfull him of life. For it is found by experience, how painfull charitie is, L. which coueteth too win vnto it any mā, yea though he be  enimie, by plentifull déedes of frendship and courtesie. Final∣ly this charitable paines taking is matched against counter∣fet loue, I. which is without faithe and without the stirring and motion of the holy Ghost, pretending a certein outward countenance, but labouring nothing at all in mind. Hebr. 6. c. 10. And thy patience.Patience. G. Patience is a spirituall and diuin vertue in déede, where throughe the godly doe with vpright mind beare out whatsoeuer aduersities God layeth vpō thē, assuring themselues that God is faithful, and that he wil not suffer his seruants too be tempted aboue their power, but wil make them way out in the middes of temptatiō, to the intent they maye bée able too endure it. 1. Cor. 10. c. 13. A. Concerning this vertue, looke afore. 1. b. 9. And howe thou canst not beare with them that bee euill.The discreete stoutnesse of ministers. G. Héere is to bée marked the discret∣nesse of the Minister, who must in no wise flatter euill folke, but set himselfe stoutly against them, and vanquish and put thē to flight with the sword of Gods word, & S. specially such as vaunt themselues vnder the name of brothers, & by that colour deceiue mē vnwares, and lead them away into error. Herevpon Moses said, put away the euill from among your selues. Deut. 13. b. 5. And Christ saieth, Beware of false Pro∣phets, which come vnto you in shéepes clothing. &c. Math. 7. b. 15. And Paule, If any man that beareth the name of a bro∣ther, be a whoremonger, or a couetous person, or a worship∣per
of images, or a railer. &c. 1. Cor. 5. d. 11. loke also, 1. Tim. 6. . 3. & Tit. 3. c. 10. And therefore the Apostle requireth that a Bishop should bée able too exhorte in sound doctrine, and too isproue such as speake against it. Tit. 1. c. 9. Suche as say they re Apostles. M. That is too say,False Pro∣phets & false Apostles. such as brag that they bée sent f God: too the end they may the easlyer beguile the rechlesse nd simple sorte. And are not, A. that is too wit, not true Apo∣tles, but false teachers, sent of themselues and not of God, ccording as the Lord complaineth of the false Prophetes by is Prophet Iere. 14. c. 14. S. Here we sée how Satan is wont o take vpon him the shape of an Angel of light, according as Paule saith 2. Cor. 11. d. 14. After the same maner do his Mi∣nisters also whē they vaunt themselues of the name of Apo∣tles, of which sort there were many alreadie in the times of the Apostles, as for example Himineus & Alexander. 1. Tim. . d. 20. & also Phigelus and Hermogenes, 2. Tim. 1. d. 15. And therfore doth Paule ye Apostle also cōmend the faith and con∣stancie of ye Ephesians, in that they gaue no place, but rather stoutly withstood ye doctrine of the false Apostles, Ephe. 1. c. 15. By ye word examine, he meaneth,Triall of doc∣trine. ye doctrin must be through∣ly tryed before wée giue our consent vnto it: according wher∣vnto Paule also sayth, Quenche not the Spirit, despise not prophesying, trie all things. 1. Thes. 5. c. 19. And Iohn sayth, Beléeue not euery spirit, but trie the spirites wither they be of God. 1. Iohn. 4. a. 1. G. Which thing is worth the marking in these dayes, when the worlde is fraughted with so manye varlettes, that it will bée a long time ere a man shall dis∣cerne the faythful from the Hipocrites. Therfore let the mi∣nisters beware, ye they bée not too hastie in laying their hands, vpon euery man, least in sted of faithfull shepherds, they set hyrelings or rather wolues ouer the flocke, of Christe, And hast found them lyers M. That is to wit in lyfe & doctrine.Hipocrisie be∣wrayeth it self at length. For in as much as Satan is their Sire, who is a most egre ene∣mie of the truth: it cannot be but they muste at length be∣wray themselues, and be found to be liers, but (as ye Apostle
sayd of some) they shall preuaile no longer, for the mael of such persons shall bée laide open to all men, like as ther was. 2. Tim. 3. c. 9. And cōcerning such deceiuers Christ said: Yée shall know them by their fruites. Math. 7. d. 16. 3. And hast suffered, and hast pacience, and hast ha∣zarded thy selfe for my names sake, and haste not fain∣ted. Constancie and pacience required in the faithfull.And hast suffered, & hast pacience. G. It is an ordinarie mt∣ter with the false Prophets, too be alwayes rising vp against the children of God and the faithfull ministers of his worde. And therfore the faithfull had néede of inuincible constancie and incredible pacience, that they may know them to be god squorges, and the instrumentes of his wrath, wherewith he not only keepeth his Church is vre, but also by his iust iudg∣ment more and more blindeth the world the enemie of truth. A. Therfore whatsoeuer the wicked ministers of Satan and the other enemies of the Church practise: the faithfull must represse their assaultes, & go forward in the way of the Lord with a constant mynd and faith: least Satan who woorketh effectually in the vngodly, may séeme too get the vpper hand of Christ. Iohn auoucheth the Byshop of Ephesus to haue done this thing stoutly, to the intent that being armed with the power of Christ, he might afterward also corageously re∣sist the enimies of the truth.Sufferance of afflictions. And hast hazarded thy selfe for my names sake. That is to say, thou hast béen in daunger of per∣secutiō and afflictions for folowing the truth earnestly, A. and for preaching it vnto others faithfully, A. without regardyng at all, the manaces, strength and power of men. The sam thing doth Paule exhort Tymothie to do: endure thou afflic∣tion (saith he) as a good souldyer of Iesus Christ. 2. Tim. 2. a. 3. And hast not fainted.Perseuerance stoutnesse in & Gods case. G. In déede it is the duetie of a stout soul∣dyer, not too faynt in the encounter, but to beare it out too the vttermost: according as Christ sayth, He that holdeth out to the ende shal be safe, Math. 24. b. 13. And surely it is a childish∣nesse
or rather a wickednesse too imbrace the worde of truth for atime, and afterwarde eyther for loue of this worlde, or for feare of persecution, to fall away in the ende: accordyng as we haue many examples at these dayes, whyche ought too holde vs in the feare of God alone. For some be so lyght and sonde, that (as the Apostle sayeth, Ephes. 4. c. 14.) they bée caryed aboute like babes at euery blast of doctrine, and for∣sake the pure woord of God for euerie lyghte occasion, or ra∣ther (whiche is horrible too bée spoken) they shamefully re∣nounce the truthe whyche they had professed in tyme paste. Suche folke were neuer earnestly endewed with the feare of God, but are tryflers, and by al meanes abhominable, like as Chryst sheweth by a double similitude. Luke. 14. f. 28.31. & Math. 13. c. 21. G. Contrarywise, the faithful which haue bid∣den the world farewell long agoe, and settled themselues on∣ly vpon Christe, are so farre off from denying the truth, that for the mayntenance thereof they yéelde not too any terrours or practizes of Sathan, but beare out couragiously whatsoe∣uer betideth, assuring themselues for a certeintie, that neither death, nor lyfe, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor heigth, nor depth, nor any other creature can separate them frō the loue which God beareth thē in Christ Iesu, Ro. 8. g. 38.39. Happie ar they therfore, to whom it is giuen to continue in Christes flocke. 4. But I haue somevvhat ageinst thee, bicause thou hast left thy first charitie. But I haue somewhat ageynst thee. G. His méening is,Slacknesse of charitie and faithe, and the inconuenience thereof. that the heate of Faith was somewhat abated among them, and that thereby they became somewhat slacker in the déedes of Charitie: like as Paule also had foretolde them at Mile∣tum, Act. 20. f. 28. And héerby it is certein, that the false Apo∣stles tooke occasion to thrust in false opinions among them bycause they perceyued them too bée cooler than they were woont too bée. G. whereby wée lerne how foreward wée bée too
declyne vnto euill, when wée bée loth too amend our forme misdooinges, or when wée like too well of our owne vyces. Surely as oft as wée haue doone any thing that is woorthye to bée reformed,A verie good Lesson. wée should out of hand bring it to the looking-glasse of Gods worde, and take it away, least wée bée beguy∣led by Satans deceytes, and at length bring Gods iust ven∣geance vpon our heades. This also is a thing to bée marked, that wée stande gyltie of sinne, not onely when wée commit any euill, but also when wée ceasse from dooing good. For hée that knoweth too doo well and dothe it not,He that goeth not still fore∣ward in god∣linesse, slydeth backe intoo vngodlinesse. is bound with sin. Iames. 4. d. 17. Therefore it is not inough not to shrink from the fayth, not too renounce the worde of the Gospell, or not too forsake Christes flocke, but wée must also ther withall make dayly some steppe forewarde in the grace and knowledge of Christ, that by putting off the olde man by little and little, wée may alwayes put on the newe man, and kéepe on our iourney right foorth too the heauenly heritage in mortifying the déedes of the fleshe by the spirite: accordyng as the Apo∣stle reporteth of himselfe, saying: This one thing do I, for∣getting that which is behynd, and indeuering my selfe to that which is afore, I folowe hard after the appoynted standarde, to the reward whervnto God calleth vs from aboue through Iesus Christ.Charitie the nourisher of faith. Phil. 3. c. 13. Bicause thou hast left thy firste chari∣tie. A. Lyke as Paule in the beginnyng of this Epistles, is woont to prayse the charitie of the Godlie matched with per∣seueraunce: so dooth Iohn blame the Churche of Ephesus for their contempt and coldnesse in that vertue, to the intent he may make them ashamed for suffering that excellent gift to waxe colde, and too bée quenched in them. G. Charitie is lyke fyre, whyche is easyly put oute if it be abated. Euen so if oure faythe bée not exercised by contynuall addyng of the woorkes of Charitie, suche is the frowardnesse of our Nature, that all the goodnesse whyche was bestowed vp∣pon vs thoroughe Gods frée fauoure, perysheth in vs out of hande. Wherefore wée muste praye vnto God, that hée
with the feruentnesse of his spirite, will increase the faithe that is sowne in our heartes, create a new hart or mynde in vs, and make vs to walke earnestly in his commaundemen∣tes: least we suffer Gods grace to slip from vs through vn∣myndfulnesse of so great benefites. 5. Remember therfore from vvhence thou art falne, andor amend. repent, and do thy former vvorks: If not, I vvil come vnto thee shortely, and remoue thy candlesticke out of his place, except thouor amende. repent. Remember therfore from whence thou art falne. S.True repen∣tance. He war∣neth them to returne to their former feruentenesse with all spéede before they be waxed starke colde, and libertie bée gi∣uen to the false Apostles to beare sway. G. Wée sée héere how swéete the Lorde is, and howe gently hée calleth back his ser∣uauntes to the acknowledging of their sinne, too the intente they may at length returne againe vnto lyfe. A. For the fyrst step vnto true repentance, is the acknowledgement of sinne, conceyued through the earnest feare of God at the hearyng of hys woorde: lyke as contrarywyse Gréeflesnesse is thoughte too bée a signe of Desperatenesse. And repente. True Repentance is the conuersion or turning of our lyfe vnto God, procéeding from a pure and earnest feare of God, and consisting of the mortification of oure fleshe, and of the olde man, and of the quickenyng of the Spirite. Therfore it is not ynough to acknowledge a mannes synne after a sorte: but Faith also muste matche with it, if wée mynde to haue our amendement accepted of God.The repen∣tance of the vngodly. For when the vn∣godlie haue acknowledged the gréeuousnesse of their synne, they are in déede afrayde of Gods wrath: howbéeit forasmuch as they thynke no further of God, but onely that hée is an a∣uenger and iudge, they faynte awaye in that opinion, ac∣cordyng as wée reade of Cayn, Genesis. 4. b. 13. of Saule 1. Samuel. 15. e. 20. a. and of Iudas the traytour Math. 27. a. 4: the Repentance of whome was nothyng else but a
certein entrie intoo hell, whereintoo they stepped aforehande in this life, and began the sufferance of their punishement, at the present sighte of the wrath of Gods maiestie. But when the faithful bée corzyed in themselues with the sting of sinne, they are also therwithall chéered and refreshed with trust of Gods mercie. And therfore their repentance is a true retur∣ning vntoo God. Whereof wée haue examples in Dauid, 2. Sam. 24. b. 10. In king Ezechias, 2. kings. 20. a. 2. and in the Niniuits Ionas.Of ryzing agein by re∣pentance and amendment of lyfe. 3. b. 5. And doo thy former woorks. G. That is too wit, which proceede of faith that woorketh by loue. Héere it is to be marked howe great diligence of woorking well, is required in the faithfull: for they must neuer cease from good woorkes euen to the laste gaspe. B. Also this place fighteth a∣gainst the Nouatians, whiche denyed forgiuenesse to such as were once falne. A. Lastely it is to be noted, that there is no true repentance, without amendment of life: wherof the A∣postle speaketh Rom. 6.Gods com∣ming in two sundrie wises. a. 4. & Ephes. 4. f. 23.24. If not, I will come vnto thee shortly. G. After the exhortation héere foloweth a threatning, which is necessarie, to the intent the stubborn-harted may vnderstand, that by theyr heaping of sinne vpon sinne, they doe nothing else but procure Gods horrible ven∣geance against themselues: according as it is written. Rom. 2. a. 5. And God is sayde to come, when by his spirite he res∣cueth and comforteth his seruantes, whome he séemed ere∣whyle too haue forgotten: or when hée beateth downe the boldnesse of the wicked, and punisheth them at whose naugh∣tynesse hée séemed to haue winked. Then dothe Gods pre∣sence touch the godly after one sort, and the vngodly after an other. For lyke as the godlie receyue therby great matter of comfort: so the other endure therby the sorer damnation. In respect hereof the day of the Lorde is described in the Scrip∣tures one whyle gladsome, and an other whyle sorowful and bitter?God warneth before he stri∣keth. S Also it is to bée marked, that the sinner is not con∣demned but after often warning, & when he despiseth them that warne him: according as it is sayd, I called ye, and ye
refused, I stretched oute my handes, and there was not. &c. Prouerb. 1. c. 24. and agein, And he sent vnto you all his ser∣uantes my prophets, rising vp early day by day, and sending too you: and they hearkened not nor gaue not eare, but hard∣ned their necke, and did worse than their fathers did. Ierem. 7. f. 26. And in an other place, all day long haue I stretched out my handes. &c. Esai. 65. a. 2. Rom. 10. d. 21. Neuerthelesse the word Shortly, doth vs to vnderstand, that vengeance han∣geth ouer the reprobates vnlooked for. For when they thinke of nothing lesse, and beléeue themselues to bée in safetie: then be they ouerwhelmed with sodaine mischief, A. as a man may see in Math. 24. d. 50. &. 1. Thess. 5. a. 3. &. 2. Pet. 2. a. 1.Punishment of vnrepen∣tantnesse by taking away the Gospell. And remoue thy Candlestick out of his place. If we take this to bée spoken of any peculiar person: the méening will be that hée shall shortly bée put from his office for disdayning to repent: (for so doo wée reade, that the posteritie of Helie was reiected from executing the office of Priesthod. 1. Sam. 2. g. 31. and Da∣uids house succéeded lykewyse in the roome of Saules.) But if it bée ment of the Church it self: the sense wil be, that those men shall for their vnthankfulnesse at length be quite bereft of the benefite of Gods woorde which they despised. G. For the place of the Candelstick is wheresoeuer the pure woorde of God is preached, loued, and kepte, although there want not some to be against it with all that they can make. And the Candelstick is taken away, when Gods woorde is no more heard nor loued, but euerywhere hated, so as the falling away from it appéereth manifestly: whiche thing you muste take good héede of, that it happen not among you. Therefore away with Ambition from among vs, away with couetousnesse, a∣way with nigardship, pryde, strife, & swelling, least the Lord take away that thing from vs, without the which wée cannot attayne saluation. Let the Iewes bée an example to vs, who were no whit inferiour to vs, and yet the kingdome of God is taken from them, and they in the meane whyle are striken with horrible blindnesse. Math. 21. d. 43. & Act. 13. g. 46. &. 28.
g. 28. S. Moreouer what hath happened to Ephesus and the East countries, for despising the healthfull admonishment of our Sauiour Christ and his Apostles: we ourselues sée. For whome notwithstanding we must pray and make continual intercession to God, that he will one day delyuer them from their pestilent errors, and bring them agayne into his shéepe∣fold.God threat∣neth with condition. Except thou repent. A. The Scripture vseth oftentimes threatnings with condition, too the end it may offer hope of saluation to such as be curable. After the same maner Christ sayth, except ye amend ye shall perish likewise. Luke. 13. a. 3. And again. Except ye beleeue that I am he, ye shall dye in your sinnes. Iohn. 8. c. 24. 6. But this thou hast, That thou hatest the doings of the Nicolaits, the vvhich I also do hate. The heresie of the Nicolai∣tes, and mis∣cheef ensew∣ing the same.But this thou hast, That thou hatest the doings of the Nico∣laites. S. Of the heresie of the Nicolaits and of their first foun∣der, Ireneus Bishop of Lyons in the .28. Chapter of his firste booke writeth in this wise. The Nicolaits which liue disorde∣redly haue for their founder, Nicolas one of the seuen that were first ordeyned deacons by the Apostles, Acts. 6. b. 5. And Iohns Apocalips sheweth fully what they be, namely how they teach that there is no difference betwéene whoredome and chastitie, and also to eate of meate offered vnto Idolles. Wherefore the word of God hath said of them, But this thou hast, that thou hatest the doings of the Nicolaits, whiche I hate also. B. Thus farre Ireneus. Of which heresie we reade in Eusebius also in the nine and twentith Chapter of the third booke of his ecclesiasticall history in this wise: Nicolas had a very faire wife. M.G. And after the ascention of our Lord and Sauior, when the Apostles rebuked him for offending in iealosie: he brought foorth his wife among them, and gaue leaue to abuse hir who would. Vpon whiche occasion, these haue thought it of consequence, that according to this déede or saying of Nicolassis euery man might play the naughtipacke
with hir whome he lyked. And so, those that vnder his name haue set vp the sect of their owne lecherie, séeke after com∣mon and vnlawfull copulations without regard of honestie. And there vppon, suche as haue sayd that women ought to be vsed in common, are commonly called Nicolaites. Whose heresie is most detestable. For it both ouerthroweth all the order which ought to be kept among men, and also is most reprochfull against God the first founder of holy mariage. For the holynesse of Matrimonie requireth, that the wyfe should not haue power ouer hir owne body, but the husband: and lykewyse that the husbande shoulde not haue power ouer hys owne bodye, but the wyfe. 1. Corin. 7. a. 4.The names of auncient fa∣thers abused to cloke sectes and heresies. Also wée sée by thys example, how it is an olde policie of Sa∣tans, to abuse the names of suche as are of estimation and credit among the people, thereby to sowe abroade errors and to rayse vp sectes. For to the intent these horrible whore∣mongers myght haue the more libertie to follow theyr vnlawfull lecherie: they coloured theyr cursed filthye vn∣cleannesse wyth the name of Nicolas the Deacon. And at this day no man is so ignorante, but he knoweth howe wicked sectes haue bin brought into the worlde vnder the names of Austin, Bernard, Francis, Dominik and o∣thers. Wherefore it standeth vs greatly in hande to be∣ware, that we sticke not too muche vntoo men, so as wée shoulde by anye meanes abuse theyr names to the hurt of Gods doctrine, or of our owne conuersation.God is not contrari too himselfe. VVhyche I al∣so do hate. A. God is not an ouerthrower of the law whyche he hath ordeyned: and therefore he cannot but abhorre the euyll whyche he hathe forbydden. Therefore thys sen∣tence standeth still in force, honorable among all men is mariage, and the vndefyled bed, but God wyll iudge whore∣mongers and aduouterers. Hebr. 13. a. 4. Looke also in Gen. 1. d. 27.28. &. 2. c. 18.22.24. &. Math. 19. a. 4. &. Rom. 7. a. 1. &. 1. 2. Cor. 7. b. 10.
7. He that hath an eare, let him heare vvhat the Spirite sayeth to the Churches. To him that ouercom∣meth I vvill giue to eate of the tree of life vvhiche is in the middes of the Paradise of my God. He that hath an eare, let him heare. A. It is vncertaine whi∣ther this be referred to the premisses,Of heering & Deafnesse. or to the sequele. It sée∣meth that it maye bée applyed to eyther of them. Notwith∣standing, it is so repeted afterward, as that nothing is added farther vnto it: wherby it is manifest, that as then it muste haue respect but only to the things that went afore. S. But by this parcell, both Christ himselfe, and also Iohn are wont to quicken vp the myndes of the slouthfull, to the consideration of the mysteries that are vttered vntoo them. And partely by these woordes hée giueth an incklyng, that all men are not indewed wyth true vnderstandyng too conceyue that whyche hée hathe too saye. Yea truely hée putteth suche a difference betwixte his héerers: that some he maketh lyght of hearing, and other some deafe. Now if it bée demaunded howe those former sorte become so lyghte of hearyng, the Scripture witnesseth in an other place, that mennes eares are not made fitte and handsome by theyr owne trauell, but are boared thorough by the Lorde. Psalme. 40. b. 7. VVhat the Spirite sayeth to the Churches.The author of holi scripture. M. Then are not the holye wryters proprely the authors of the thinges that they write, but the holie Ghoste, who is God. In respecte whereof, their writing is sayd too be inspired by God, 2. Tim. 3. d. 16. bicause they both spake and wrate by the mouyng of the holie Ghost.The scripturs pertein too all folkes in com∣mon. 2. Pet. 1. d. 21 Also wée gather by this place, that the thinges whyche are wrytten héere are not to bée restrayned onely too the Pastours of Churches, but per∣teyne to the verie bodie of the Churche, which is compacted of dyuers membres: accordyng as wée haue sayde already in the fyrste verse of this chapter.To ouer∣come. To him that ouercommeth, I wyll giue to eate. Too ouercome signifieth héere, too gette
the vpper hande of deathe, Hell, Sinne, and the worlde, by the power of faythe, and neuer too forsake the truthe for any afflictions that are sent. For that is the true victorie of the godly, whereof Iohn maketh mention, 1. Epistle. 5. a. 4. And too EateToo eate. signifyeth not in this place too beleeue (as it doth in Iohn. 6. e. 50.51.) but too bée refreshed and satisfyed, too receyue comfort, and too bée quickened vntoo euerlastyng lyfe.The reward of perseuerāce in Christen manlinesse. Of the tree of life which is in the middes of the Paradise. S. To him that obeyeth Gods commandement and manfully withstandeth the temptation of Satan, heere is promised the eating of the trée of life which is in the middes of Paradise, from whence the firste Father of vs all was cast oute, and by Gods iust iudgement condemned too suffer the sundrie mysteries of this lyfe, for yeelding too the temptation of the diuell, and for be∣comming disobedient vnto Gods commaundement, Gene. 3. d. 23.. Whereby wée maye consider that as the mynd of man, whych is reuolted from God, is miserable or wretched: so also is his state accordyng therevnto.Chryst the frute of the tree of lyfe. The fruite of that trée is Christ himselfe, who is the Apple wherewith the choosen faithfull are deyntely fed for euermore. For looke what was loste in Adam: the same is restored ageyn in Christ, too all such as beléeue in him wyth their whole hart. Rom. 5. c. 15.16.17.18.19. And (as it is sayde in another place) wée bée made partakers of the nature of the Godhead. 2. Petr. 1. a. 4. & haue felowship with the father, and the sonne, 1. Iohn. 1. b. 3. whiche thing he speaketh heere vnder a borowed spéeche by eating of the trée of life. And he alludeth too the things that Moses wri∣teth of the trée of lyfe, Gene. 2. b. 9. whereof yée shall sée more hereafter Chap. 22. c. 14. And Christ (vnder the resemblance of a feast) sayth, He shall make them sit downe, and he hym∣selfe shall goe vp and downe and serue them. Luke. 12. e. 37. A. And againe, you are they that haue abidden by me in al my temptations, and accordyng as my father hath ordeyned for mée, so haue I ordeyned a Kingdome for you, that you maye ate and drynke at myne owne table in my Kingdome, &c.
Luke. 22. c. 28.29.30. To be short, this is a renuing of the pro∣mise wherby he hath behyghted vs euerlasting life, 1. Iohn. 2. d. 25. S. G. Now then, so euident an assurance of rewarde (if he bée of credite that hath promised it) must néedes make vs the more chéerefull and corageous too the encounter, that wée suffer not our selues too bée outfaced by our enemies. A. Con∣cerning Pardise, B. properly it is called that place in the gar∣den of Eden Eastward,Of paradyse. which the Lord had planted, and pla∣ced mā in it too take his delight and pleasure there. Gen. 2. b. 8. And it was called a Garden by reason of the finenesse of it, bicause Gardens are wont too bee more fine and pleasant thā other places, accordyng also as this place of Paradise was better furnished and trimmer than other places. Now, wé know that Gods glorie is described vntoo vs vnder figures of most excellent things, bycause we cannot conceyue them o∣therwise: like as the paines of the vngodly are set out vnto vs by the name of fire. C. for as muche then as in the Scrip∣tures euery happie and fruitefull countrie is termed the gar∣den of God, Esai. 51. a. 3. therevpon it fell too bée a custome a∣mong the Gréekes, (yea euen before the comming of Christ) that Paradise should signifie the heauenly glory, as it appée∣reth in Ecclesiasticus. 40. c. 7. &. 44. c. 15. And in this sense is it taken in Luke. 23. f. 43. where Christ answereth the théefe. This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise: that is too say, this day shalt thou inioy the presence of God, in the state and life of the blissed sort. B. Therefore some of the auncient wri∣ters haue erred in making muche talke about the Paradise which the Sainctes should inhabite after the iudgement day. For what hath a soule or spirit, yea or what hath a heauenly and glorifyed bodie to do with an earthly Paradise? Of my God. In respect that Christ is very man, he calleth the father his God, like as in Iohn, 20. d. 17. B. And this parcell is added to put a difference betwixt the fruite of the earthly Paradise and the fruite of the heauenly Paradise.
8. And too the Angell of the Churche of Smyrna, vvrite. Thus saith the first and the laste, vvhiche vvas dead and is aliue. And too the Angell of the Churche of Smyrna, wryte. A.Bishops of the Church of Smyrna. Con∣cerning Smyrna (which is as much too say as Myrrhe) looke afore in, 1. c. 11. S. Of this Church sainct Polycarp is thought to haue béen the Bishop: of whom Eusebius maketh mention in the .xiiij. and xv. Chapters of the fourth booke of his Eccle∣siasticall histories, and in the .xxiiii. chapter of his fifth booke. Also there is a certeine Epistle put oute vnder the name of saint Ignatius too the Smyrnians, concerning the true God∣head and manhood of Christ: and also another to Polycarp Bishop of the same Churche. By which it may be gathered with what heresies Satan troubled that Church at ye tyme, by his ministers. Thus saith the first & the last, which was dead & is aliue. M.S. It is a very fit preface to perswade patience. q. d.An exhorta∣tion vnto the patience. Although yée bée like too suffer manie things in defense of the truth, yet faint not: bicause he for whose name yée suffer, is the first and last, and so consequently almightie God, who is able too plucke yée out of the handes of your enemyes as ofte as he listeth, and too make all their practizes vayne & of none effect. And though he thinke if good that you suffer death for the Gospels sake: yet let not your hartes quayle for all that. For the same partie for whose sake ye suffer, was dead: that is to saye, was thought too haue lost bothe the power of his Kingdome, and the glory of his miracles together wyth hys life. And yet notwithstanding he lyueth, manifesting the power and glorye of his Godheade, by ouercommyng death: accordyng as Paule teacheth, Rom. 1. a. 4. also looke afore in. 1. d. 18. 9. I knovv thy vvorkes and thine affliction, and thy pouertie (but thou art rich) and the blasphemie of those that say they bee Ievves and are not, but are the Syna∣gog of Satan.
Hypocrisie must bee eschewed.I know thy works. G. All good works are euermore apparant in Gods sight: and therefore they must be frée from all hypo∣crisie. Looke Math. 6. a. 1.2.3.4.5.6. &. c. 16.17.18. And thine af∣fliction. S. He commendeth them for the bearing out of their af∣flictions and the spoyle of their goods,Comfort of affliction. which they had indured with a stout courage for the fayth of Christ. And whereas he sayth he knoweth their tribulation: he sheweth how he is not ignorant of the troubles which the godly abide, although hée make countenance to the contrary for a time. Whereby the faithfull conceiue great matter of comfort. A. For what mo∣ueth them more to despaire in aduersitie, than when they thinke themselues neglected of God? But when they are throughly perswaded that God hath a care of them: they yéeld to no assaults of Satan, they force not for the manaces of their enimies. Neyther feare they those that can but kill the body only: but hanging wholly vpon Gods prouidence, they beare out whatsoeuer misfortune befalleth them, with a pa∣tient and stout mind.Two kinds of tribulation or affliction. C. And there be two sorts of tribulation. The one bréedeth of the gréefe which the faithful conceyue of the skornings, leawdnesse, blasphemies, and skoffings wher∣with the vngodly mocke at the Gospel and promisses of God, Of which matter looke Gal. 4 d. 29. &. Philip. 3. d. 18. &. 2. Pet. 3 a. 3 and also of the pitie whiche they haue of those that be blinded. Whereof Paule speaketh. Rom. 9. a. 1. And this kind of persecution may be called inward.Outward tribulation or persecution. The other procéedeth of such things as are laid vpon them outwardly, as of hunger imprisonment, exile, losse of goodes, sword, and death. This is the outward persecution wherewith Tyrants and other eni∣mies of the Church rage agaynst the children of God, howbe∣it that the one can scarce happen without the other, in so much as thys saying of the Apostle is most true, that all they whyche wyll lyue godlyly in Chryst Iesu shall suffer persecution.Exmple of patience in aduersitie. 2. Timo. 3. c. 12. And thy pouertie. He addeth thys bycause their Churche suffered these thynges not only at the handes of Heretikes, Schismatikes, and Varlets but also of
the handes of the open enimies of the truth, which spoyled the godly of all theyr goodes, and broughte them to greate pouertie: A. Like as we reade, that it happened to the Iewes, vntoo whome the Apostle writeth in thys wyse: Call to your remembrance the former times, wherein you be∣ing enlyghtened, endured a greate encounter of afflictions, partly in béeing a gazingstocke to all men for the reproche and oppressions wherewyth you were touched, and partly in being companions of suche as were in that cace: for you haue bin partakers of the afflictions that happened by rea∣son of my bondes, and haue suffered the spoyling of youre goodes wyth gladnesse. Hebr. 10. e. 32.33.34.Of Paradise. The pouertie or poorenesse of spirite. Certesse Pouer∣tie is a spice of true lowlinesse: eyther wherethrough the Godly chalenge nothyng at all too themselues, but thynke themselues beholden to God for all thynges: (according as Iames teacheth that GOD is the gyuer of all good thinges Iames. 1 c. 17:) or wherethrough the faythfull béeing tamed and subdewed by aduersitie, doo submit themselues wholly vnto God, and béeing humbled inwardly, do yéelde them∣selues vp into his tuicion.The pouertie of riche Chri∣stians. And this pouertie is properly cal∣led the poorenesse of spirite, according as it is sayde in Math. 5. a. 3. There is another pouertie, whyche is a certayne holy and inwarde renouncing of the thynges of thys worlde: wherethrough the godly (although sometyme they be riche) possesse theyr owne goodes as though they possessed them not: lyke as Abraham, Ioseph, Dauid, and others dyd. The poore of these two sortes béeyng contented wyth theyr lot, grudge not agaynste God, but rather re∣ioyce excéedingly in the God of Heauen and earth. And so béeyng the chyldren of God they possesse the earthe: and béeyng made heires of the worlde wyth Abraham, they sur∣mount euen kings and princes in welthinesse.Christen rich∣nesse. And there∣fore by and by there is added, But thou art rich. M.G.S That is to wit in spirituall goodes, although poore in temporall goodes: rich in heauen, though poore in the worlde: riche in conscience,
though poore in mony: rich in faith, though poore in fléeting coyne. Of whiche matter looke Math. 6. c. 19.20. &. 19. c. 21. &. Mark. 10. d. 29.30. &. Rom. 4. c. 13. &. 8. f. 32. &. 2. Cor. 6. c. 10. &. Iames. 2. a. 5. And the blasphemie of them. S. It is an ordinarie matter among the children of darknesse,Blasphemies and slanders. to charge the pure worshippers of God with sundry slaunders and reproches, to the end they may make their profession be hated and out of credit with all mē. And though they preuayle little that way: yet go they about still with their false reports to ouerthrowe the things that the other haue rightly and godlyly ordeined, which say they be Iewes.Hypocrites & misprofessers of religion. M. That is to say, whiche boast them∣selues to be professors of the true faythe, and misreport thée to folow a false doctrine. The hipocritly Iewes mainteyning most stiffely the Ceremonies of the law agaynst the Christi∣an libertie, stirred vp trouble on all sides against the prea∣chers of the same, and so went about to make the beléefe in Christ to be of none effect, as it may easly be gathered by the story that Luke hath written, Act. 13. g. 45.50. &. 14. a. 5. And are not. G.S. q.d. Although they séeme to be pure worshippers of God & folowers of the religion of their forefathers: although they be circumcised and descēded lineally from the Patriark Abraham as touching the flesh: Yet are they not Iewes in very deede, séeing they wilfully reiect the saluation promised and offered to the Iewes. In respect whereof, the Apostle dis∣feateth them of the sayd boasting, wherethrough they glory∣ed, as well of their auncitrie, as of the law. Rom. 7. a. 1.2.3. &. 9. a 4.31. &. Galat. 3. b. 10. Wherewithall agrée also those things, both which Iohn baptist. Math. 3. b. 9. and also whyche Christ himselfe Iohn 8. e. 39. haue boldly vttered against their vayne bragging.False Chri∣sns anoye the Churche moste. And there be no enimies more noysome and feerce against the Church, than such as pretend to be faythfull and fréendly, and are not. Wherefore the Tyrants and open enimies of the godly are not so muche to be feared, as the false brethren and hypocrites that are intermedled wyth the faithfull seruantes of Chryst, according as dayly experi∣ence
teacheth. For many at this day bewray themselues to be Antichrists, and most bitter enimies of the truth, whych séemed héeretofore, to be not only vnfeyned professors, but al∣so stout mainteiners of the Christian religion. But in so do∣ing it appeareth, that they neuer were of the number of the godly in very déede. For had they bin godly indéede, doutlesse they had continued in Christes flocke, and neuer fledde from the companie of the Godly. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 19.A ryght re∣semblance of the papistes. But are the Synagog of Satan. As if he should say, Let them brag as much as they list, of the séede of Abraham, of the couenant, of the law, of circumcision, of their forfathers, and of the Lords Temple: yet are they so farre off from being of the true Church, that they be rather the seruants of Satan, who worketh effectual∣ly in them and persecuteth the true Church by them, like as Ismael, who was counted the first begotten, persecuted the true and only heire Isaac. Gen. 21. a 9. &. Rom. 9. b. 7. &. Galat. 4. d. 29. Let those men wey these things aduisedly, whyche being puft vp in vaine with the title of the Apostolik Church and the right Catholike fayth, go about to oppresse the true Church of Christ with their manaces, terriblenesse, slaun∣ders, sundrie kyndes of tormentes, yea and euen with sword and fire. 10. Feare none of those things vvhyche thou shalte suffer. Behold, the Diuell shall cast some of you into prison, that you may beThe latine signifieth bothe to trye and to tempt. tēpted: & ye shal haue tribu∣lation for ten dayes. Be faithfull vnto the death, and I vvill giue thee a Crovvne of life. Feare none of those things which thou shalt suffer. P. He exhor∣teth the Church to endure patiently the troubles at hande, that in any wise it yéeld not to the diuell and his ministers. M. q.d. Thou must not faint, neyther for the troubles past, nor yet for greater, suche as thou must endure hereafter for de∣fense of the truth of the Gospell. O. This exhortation is agre∣able with that of Christes, feare not them that kill but
the body. &c. Math. 10. c. 28. A. Not that the godly can be voyde of all feare: (for their patience differeth far from the sturdy∣nesse of the Philophers and of the Stoikes) but bycause it must ouermatche the terror whiche is offered too the fleshe. S. For otherwise euen Christ our Lord was (according to the weakenesse of the fleshe) stricken with feare and heauinesse when he drew néere his passion, and prayed that he myghte haue eschewed it: howbeit in suche wise as therewithall he prayed also, that his fathers wyll might bée fulfilled. Mat. 26. d.The differēce betwene Chri¦stes affections and ours. 39. and Luke. 22. e. 42. A. Notwithstanding there is verye great oddes betwixt the pure affections of him, who was al∣wayes separated from the number of sinners (Hebr. 7. d. 26.) and the sinfull affections of vs. For the cause why our affec∣tions are faultie, is for that they runne headlong, and haue no stay of themselues: but in Christ, for as muche as they were quiet and settled to the obeying of God, they were vtter∣ly faultlesse. For if yée confer the passions of his mind wyth ours, they shall differ as muche from ours, as the cléere and vnmuddie water that glydeth with a quiet streame, differeth frō troubled and myrie froth. In déede Christ troubled him∣selfe and was sore moued: howbeit in such wise, as he hie himselfe still vnder his fathers obedience.Affections must be ruled, and not roo∣ted out. And Christes ex∣ample alone ought too bée ynough too make vs put away the steelie sturdinesse of the Stoikes: for from whence should we fetch the rule of absolute perfection but frō him? Nay rather wée must indeuer too correct & too tame the sturdinesse wher∣in oure affections are bewrapped throughe the sin of Adam, and too followe Christ for our capteine, that he may bring vs in order. Euen so Paule would not haue vs to be stonie har∣ted, but too measure our sorow, so as wée giue not our selues ouer too it, like the vnbeléeuers which haue no hope. 1. Thes. 4 b. 13. For Christ hath therfore taken our affections vpon him, too the ende that by his power wée might subdue whatsoeuer is amisse in them. BV. Too bée short, wheras Iohn the Euan∣gelist sayth that Christ groned at such time as he was about
too raise vp Lazarus, Iohn. 11. g. 33. he meaneth that Christe was so moued and shaken euen all his bowells throughe, as he could not speake any word for a time. For so reade we al∣so of Ioseph, that he hasted awaye bycause his bowels irned vpon his brother, and sought a place too wéepe in Gene. 43. f. 3. Beholde, the diuell shall caste some of you in prison. G.Christians must alwayes be in redinesse too suffer persecution. After Iohn hath declared that the godly haue néede of patience, by reason of the troubles that were at hand: nowe he addeth in what wise that Churche shoulde bée persecuted. He sayeth howe some shall bée cast in prison, that thereby the worde of God may bée herde no more, and that they which haue heard it, may bée put in feare as much as might bée. A. And the holy Ghost ment too foretell thys thing by the mouth of Iohn, too the ende that the godly myght buckle themselues the better vnto patience: accordyng as Chryst sayde too hys Apostles, I haue tolde you these things, that you myght not bée offen∣ded. Iohn. 16. a. 1. But the persecutions of the Church are fa∣thered héere vpon the diuell, that the faythfull may vnder∣stand, how they haue not too deale with fleshe and bloud, but with the Prince of darkenesse: against whome when they shall encounter, they must take themselues, not too fleshely, but too ghostly weapons, & not set fleshe, but God alone too be their arme. Of which matter ye may sée more in Eph. 6. c. 13.14.15.16.17.18.An effectuall perswasion too patience in all trubbles & temptatiōs. A wonder it is how muche it maketh too méek∣nesse, when wée bée perswaded that wée bée assaulted, not by men, but by Satan. A. Heerevpon Paule sayde: least I might bée auaunced aboue measure through the prerogatiue of Re∣uelations, there was gyuen vnto mée a sting by the fleshe, the Messenger of Satan too buffet mée, least I myght bée ex∣alted oute of measure. 2. Cor. 12. b. 17. For by the Messenger of Satan, he betokeneth all manner of temptations where∣withall he hymselfe béeyng a holy man and the faythfull ser∣uaunt of Christ was exercised. S. It is a fondnesse therefore too hate men, whiche are forced by Satan too doo they wote not what. Wée should rather pray for them, that they might
bée made our brethren by knowyng the truth, and bée exer∣cised wyth vs. G. Then if the faythfull purpose too ouercome their chéefe enemye, that is too wit, Satan: they néede not too beate backe rayling wyth rayling, wrong wyth wrong, and violence wyth violence: (for one Satan shall neuer put another Satan too flyght) but they muste vanquishe the out∣rage of thys enemye wyth méekenesse, and by endeueryng too render good for euyll, too suche men as are dryuen by the spirite of Satan: accordyng as Chryst teacheth his Disci∣ples too possesse theyr Soules in patience, Luke. 21. d. 19. By the waye, thys place teacheth vs, that all persecutors of Gods woorde (what zeale so euer they pretende) are ledde by the spirite of Satan, who is bothe a murtherer from the beginnyng, and also the father of all lying, Iohn. 8. f. 44. That you maye bee tempted.Temptation and how God is sayde too tempte. S.G.M. That is too say, that there maye bée made a tryall of you and of your faythe before men: for as in respecte of God, you bee well ynoughe kno∣wen vntoo hym. Nay rather he séeth your thoughtes much more cléerely than your owne selues doe: for he is a sear∣cher of mennes reynes and hartes. Psalm. 7. c. 9. and Iere. 17. b. 10. The woord Temptation is often times taken gene∣rally for any manner of tryall: in which signification God is sayde too haue tempted Abraham when he tryed his faith, Gene. 22. a. 1. So also wée bée tempted (that is too say tryed) as well by aduersitie as by prosperitie, bycause that through occasion thereof the affections that lay hyd afore, come forth into the light. Sure we are, that euery man is tempted of his owne lust and not of God, accordyng as Iames declareth in his first Chapter the .xiij. and .xiiij. verses. Notwithstan∣dyng, for as much as God not only yéeldeth vs vp too the lust of Satan too kindle in vs the fire of concupiscence, but also vseth the same Satan as hys hand seruaunte as ofte as it pleaseth him, too driue men headlong intoo destruction: He also dooth after a sorte tempte men or leade them into temp∣tation. In which sense it is sayde that the euill spirit of God
came vpon Saule. 1. Kings. 16. c. 14. Too the same purpose al∣so tend manie other places of the Scripture. And yet shall we not for all that, call God the authour of any euill: bycause that in casting men intoo a wicked mynde, he exerciseth not a confused tyrannie, but executeth his rightfull iudgementes thoughe too vs secrete. G.S. Also it is too bée noted,The end why God afflicteth the faithfull. that afflicti∣ons are not sent to destroy the godly, but too exercise them, too the ende that when their fayth is tryed, it may bee the surer too truste vntoo, accordyng as is sayde. 1. Petr. 1. b. 7. B. But the intent why the enemye killeth not oute of hande,The ende of the diuels tempting and afflicting. but casteth men intoo prison and tempteth them a long tyme is that beyng vtterly discoraged wyth the long continuance of their myseries, they shoulde at length forsake theyr faythe. And yee shall haue tribulation for ten dayes. S. That is too saye,The number of tenne. manye dayes. A. For it betokeneth, that the Churche shal be in continuall warfare vnder the Crosse of persecution. S. For the number of tenne is the number of fulnesse: and therfore it is not too bée obserued too nycely. So sayd Iacob too his fa∣therinlawe: beholde thou haste chaunged my wages tenne tymes. Gene. 31. a. 7. f. 41. B. And in another place it is sayd, They haue tempted mée nowe tenne tymes. Numb. 14. d. 22. Also, beholde, yee haue offered mée reproche tenne tymes, Iob. 19. a. 3. that is too say oftentimes and sundry wayes.There is no truce betwene the diuell and the faithfull. As soone then as the faithfull bée dispatched oute of one affliction: let them buckle themselues too the bearing of another: for ye diuell will scarce giue them so much as a truce. And truly the cruel persecutions of the Emperors & Princes of this world, and of the Heretikes, may bée witnesses vntoo vs of the con∣tinuall warfare of ye Christiās. There is no end of our war∣fare til wee be out of this worlde. Ageine, like as wée bée in∣fected with sundry diseases: so is it no maruel though God vse sūdry & diuers medicines to cure thē. Diuers wayes therfore doth ye lord chastize vs, bicause Ambitiō, couetousnesse, enuie, gluttony, vnrulinesse, ye loue of the world, & the innumerable lustes ye swarme in vs, cānot be healed al with one medicine.
Bee faythfull vntoo the death.Exhortation to perseuerāce A. He exhorteth too perseuerance or holding out. S. Whereby it appéereth what he ment by the ten dayes, for he biddeth vs kéepe the faith during all ye tyme of our life, as the which is also all our life long assaulted by the aduersarie power. He therfore that holdeth not the fayth vntoo the ende, was neuer indued with true faith. For looke whom God hath predestinated, them hath he called, & whom he hath called, thē hath he iustifyed, and whom he hath iusti∣fyed, them also hathe he glorifyed. Rom. 8. f. 30. He that is faythlesse is not iustifyed: and he that is not iustifyed, ne∣uer had fayth. And I wyll giue thee a Crowne of lyfe. G. Those that bée iustifyed by fayth,Crowne of lyfe. are at length also glorifyed, that is too say, crowned. But none shall bée crowned sauing be that wagereth lawfully. 2. Tim. 2. a. 5. By the word Crowne, Iohn meaneth the immortalitie and euerlasting lyfe which is prepared for all the godly: G. lyke as when Iames sayeth, Blessed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tryed he shall receyue the crowne of life, which the Lord hath promised too all that loue him, Iames. 1. b. 12. This did Paule looke for with a quiet mynd and an assured fayth, when he wrate thus: I haue foughte a good feight, and fulfilled my course, and kept the faith, from henceforth is laid vp for me a Crowne of rightuousnesse which the Lorde shall gyue mée at that day. 2. Tim. 4. b. 7.8. B. By the way, least any mā might stablishe mens merites vpon this and such like places) it is too bée considered,God crow∣neth his owne works in vs. that God crowneth his owne gyftes and woorkes which he worketh in vs by his Spirit, yea and that, of his owne frée fauor, too the intent it may openly appeare, how much the soundnesse of our life pleaseth him. 11. He that hath an eare, let him heere vvhat the Spi∣rit saith too the Churches. He that ouercommeth shal not be hurt of the second death.
He that hath an eare, &c. G. Whatsoeuer is conteyned in this Reuelation, it is the voyce of the Holye Ghost, which it behoueth vs too wyshe aboue all things, and too saye. Speake Lorde, for thy seruaunt héereth thée. 1. Sam 3. b. 9.10. A. Sée the seuenth verse of thys present Chapter.What the crowne of life is. He that ouercom∣meth shall not bee hurte of the seconde death. S. Héereby it ap∣peareth what that Crowne of lyfe is, whereof Iohn hath spo∣ken: that is too wit, too bée compassed about on all sides both in soule and bodie, wyth the euerlasting pleasantnesse of life,Two kindes of death, and twoo kyndes of lyfe. as with a Crowne or garlond. And héere wée sée how there are two kinds of death, ye one of the body, ye other of the soule. Both the which, Christ hath comprehended in fewe words, saying: Bée not afrayde of them that kill the bodie, & cannot kill the soule: but rather feare him which can cast both soule and bodie intoo hell fyre. Math. 10. c. 28. A. And when as Paul saith I desire too bée loozed and to be with Christ, Phil. 1. d. 23. He defineth most manifestly what bodily life is, and what bo∣dily death is, and what happeneth after death too such as be∣léeue in Christ. For whē he saith loozed, he meaneth that this bodily life is nothing else but a prison, wherin a man is kept tied & bound, so as he cannot haue the true felicitie, and so as he may not liue with his lord Christ. For although Christ be alwaies with vs in this life: yet notwithstanding, we be not able to reape in this flesh the fruite of ye happinesse yt we haue in Christ, by reason of the burthē of this bodie & the filthinesse of our soule, wherwith we be ouerwhelmed through original sin. And therfore this bodily life is but a prisō, wherin who so setteth his only desire to abide, is in cace as if a prisoner that might be let looze, had leuer to tarie still fast bound & fettered in his prison. A. Agein by the worde looze,What bodily deathe is. it is manifest what bodily death is. G. Heathenish mē take death to be a cleane dis∣patch of a mā, as though he wholly perished, & R. to be ye last ende of all miseries. G. But the scripture telleth vs yt death is but a loozening of ye soule from ye body. R. Which Christ hath made most pleasant vnto al godly folke, wheras it is ye worst
thing that can be too the wicked. And therfore we must con∣sider death, not such as it séemeth too bée, but such as Chryst hath made it to bée.The death of the soule. But the death of ye soule, (which is called the second death) is an vtter estranging of the soule frō God. For like as the soule is ye life of ye body, so is God the life of ye soule. Therfore although it be decréed that all men must dye once, Hebr. 9. g. 27. yet notwithstanding whosoeuer persisteth in Gods truth to the ende, there is no cause why he shoulde feare the euerlasting death, bicause he is alreadie passed from death vnto life. Iohn. 5. d. 24. 12. And too the Angell of the Churche of Perga∣mus, vvrite: Thus sayth he that hath the sharpe svvord vvith tvvo edges. And to the Angell. &c. G. The things that are written here, perteine chiefely too those Churches wherein is a stedfaste maintenāce of the truth, and sharp persecution for the same, and yet some fauourers of false opinions also. Concerning Pergamus looke afore, 1. c. 11. Thus sayth he that hath the sharpe sword with two edges.Chrystes iu∣diciall power. S. In these wordes is described the iudi∣ciall power of our sauiour Christ. M. And for as much as in this exhortation Iohn treateth of the difference betwéen the good and the bad, and of the sholing of the one from the other by the rigor of Iustice: therfore he writeth howe such a one shall come, as hath both skill and abilitie to do it. Concerning the two edged swoord we haue spoken afore. 1. d. 16. 13. I knovve thy vvorkes and vvhere thou dvvellest, euen vvhere as is the seate of Satan, and that thou hol∣dest fast my name, and hast not denyed my faith: yea euen in the dayes in vvhiche Antipas my faithfull vvit∣nesse vvas put too deathe among you vvhere Satan dvvelleth. I knowe thy workes. G. Concerning the knowing of workes looke in the .9. verse. And where thou dwellest. M. Verely euen
in the middes of a wicked and froward nation. For these god∣ly folke of Pergamus were intrenched round about by their enimies & persecuters: & so, the hardlier that they could escape the greater was their persecution.The seate of Satan and where it is. Euē where as is the seate of Satan. S. Whersoeuer vngodlinesse reigneth, whersoeuer ini∣quitie rageth, whersoeuer wickednes is not only vnpunished but also allowed & rewarded: there is the seate of Satā. Such were the Cities and countries wherin the Giants bare sway before ye floud. Gen. 6. a. 4. Also in Sodom, Gen. 19. a. 4. Like∣wise such was it that Dauid describeth, Psal. 55. b. 10. & final∣ly such as ye Prophets describe Ierusalē to haue béen in their time, and such as Iohn describeth Babilō to be in this book. Such also in these dayes are ye Cities wherin the rake h of the papisticall faction beare sway, where godlinesse is made high treason, & al honest behauior banished. There dareth no man to speake openly of Christ or of his kingdome, or to sing Psalmes, or to reade ye holy Gospell, except he wil be sacked of all his goods, or be throwē into prison, or be burned or han∣ged for his labor. And it appéereth that the citie of Pergamus was in the like cace at those dayes. Wherfore it is no maruel though such as dwelt there & serued Christ, be commended in this place. A. Now let ye Popes flatterers go & make as great brags as they list of Peters chaire: yet shal not ye holy Ghost be reproued of lying, who telleth vs flatly, that whersoeuer ye truth hath no roome, there is not ye seate of Christ, nor of Pe∣ter, nor of any Apostle, but of Satan.Christes name. And that thou holdest fast my name. M. that is too say, the faith that is preached in the po∣wer of my name, against heretikes, false Apostles, & mistea∣chers. And hast not denied my faith. B. That is to say, hast per∣sisted in the confession of my name,Christes faithe. frō which the enimies of the truth haue indeuered to withdraw thée. A. Here thou seest manifestly how faith is ye gift of God: for in expresse termes Christ calleth it his owne. Yea euen in the dayes in which An∣tipas. &c. Some followyng the faultie Printed Copyes wherein it is written in Gréeke  (that is too saye My)
in sted of  (that is to say in which or wherin) translate it,An example of a fāithful seruant of Chryst. In my dayes Antipas. &c. was put to deathe among you. S. It is a likelihood yt this Antipas was some one of the notabler mini∣sters of the Church, whō the seruantes of Satan could ye lesse away with, bicause he taught Christ there more earnestly & strongly than others did, & stoode more stoutly against ye ad∣uersaries in defence of the things which the true faith contei∣neth. And that is to bée coniectured vpō this, yt he calleth him a faithful witnesse, such a one as Steuen was at Ierusalem. And truly this name agreed very wel vnto him: for this word Antipas is as much to say, as before or against all men. For no∣thing ought to moue a Christian hart from the constancie of faithe & pure confession of the truth. VVhere Satan dwelleth. Then whersoeuer iust men & giltlesse persons are cruelly & openly put to death,Wher Satan beares sway, the godly go too wrecke. and contrariwise the worst sorte had in honor & reputation: it is an euident signe ye Satan reygneth there. So was ther no roome for Dauid in Saules kingdom, where Doeg and suche like mates were highly aduaunced & put in chief authoritie next the King. So were the Prophets and priests of Baal had in honor with king Achab, and were allowed interteinment at the kings owne table: when in the meane while, the Lordes Prophets were either thrust out of their Countrie and faine to shrowd themselues in caues of Mountaines, or else put to death if they were founde. A. Not∣withstanding, it is to be marked by the way, that ye death of the Saints is precious in the Lordes sight. Psal. 116. c. 14. In consideration wherof, euen after their death, the scripture is wont to yeelde them the recorde of righteousnesse and sted∣fast faith: as a man may see, Math. 23. d. 35. 14. But I haue a feavve things against thee: bycause thou hast there mainteiners of the doctrine of Balaam, vvho taught Balac to cast a stumbling blocke afore the children of Israel, to eate of things offered vnto Images and to commit vvhoredome.
15. So hast thou also mainteiners of the doctrine of the Nicolaits, the vvhich I hate. But I haue a few things against thee. A.Gods mini∣sters must tel the truthe playnly. Bycause the holy Ghost is the truth, he can flatter no man: but whatsoeuer hée findeth in mē worthy to be blamed, he freely discouereth it. In this place therefore, he rebuketh certaine of this Churche of Pergamus, which had not set themselues agaynst the decey∣uers, but had suffered the fauorers & followers of heresies in their company. Whereby it was to be feared, least the same mischeéfe might creepe further abrode, and at length infect the whole Church: according as Paule sayth, a litte leuen sow∣reth the whole lumpe of dow. 1. Cor. 5. b. 6. &. Galat. 5. b. 9. And agayne, their talke (sayth he) will fret as a Canker. 2. Timo. 2. c. 17. Mainteyners of the doctrine of Balaam, who taught. &c. M. The story that Iohn toucheth héere, is well knowen.Casting of stumbling blockes in mens wayes. Ba∣laam taught Balac king of the Madianits to trim vp wo∣men, and to send them downe to the children of Israell, to en∣tice them to vnlawfull copulation with them, and to Idola∣trie: B. according as we reade in Nume. 31. c. 8.16. &. 25. a. 2.3. So the heretikes taught the princes of the earth what way they might ouerthrowe the true Israelits and people of God, and leade them aside from the vncorrupt doctrine of fayth.Dissimulatiō. To eate of things offered vnto Images. A. How detestable this ought to be vnto all godly folke, euery man may gather by. 1. Cor. 5. c. 11. &. 10. e. 20. So as our counterfet Nicodemusses néede not to sooth them selues any more, when they are present at the so∣lemne ceremonies of the vngodly. And to commit whoredome.The abhomi∣nablenesse of whoredome. There was so greate libertie of whorehunting in olde tyme, that the Apostles published a decrée against it: least that they whyche had professed themselues Christians, being eguyled by the long continuance of mennes customes, myght thinke the thyng lawfull, whych God hath forbidden from the beginning. Of whyche matter sée Acts. 15. f. 29. &. 1. Cor. the whole fifth Chapter. &. 6. d. 18. &. 7. a. 2. &. Hebr. 13. a. 4.
Yet neuerthelesse,The shame∣full wicked∣nesse of our Popish Ba∣laamites. this present age hath many Balaamits, or rather worse than Balaam himselfe, that is to wit the Monks and Chaplins of the popish Cleargie, which blisse and curse any man for a péece of mony: and afterward surfit of the sacrifices offered at Obites and vnto Saincts. And for asmuch as by the Popes decrées, they be forbidden lawfull mariage: they assault all women with lawlesse lecherie, and yet go for very good bachelers all the whyle. And when they be repro∣ued of periurie for stayning the chastitie whiche they had vo∣wed by oth when they receyued holy orders: they are wont to iest it out in this wise, that they had not promised chastitie, otherwise than so farre foorth as humaine frailtie would giue them leaue, and therefore are not bounde to the full perfor∣mance of chastitie, whiche for as much as humaine frailtie permitteth them not so to obserue, they saye it is law∣full for them to kéepe whores. But why conclude they not thus? humaine frailtie permitteth vs not to liue chaste: Ergo we must take vs lawfull wiues. For the Apostles saying is cléere, it is better to marrie than to burne. 1. Cor. 7. b. 9. And a∣gaine, no whoremonger or vncleane person. &c. hath any in∣heritance in the kingdome of Christ and of God. Ephes. 5. b. 5. But they (like wretches as they be,) had leuer to follow the doctrine of Diuels and to rot and perish in their vnspeakable whoredoms, than to hearken to the preceptes of Christ and his Apostles. S. And héerein appéereth the great blindnesse of princes and of the common people, that none of them almost accounteth whorehunting for sinne, albeit that the Apostle tell them flatly,The blynd∣nesse of world∣ly Princes. that God will iudge whoremongers. Heb. 13. a. 4. and that Paule willeth vs to shet them out of our dores, & not so much as to eate bread with them. 1. Cor. 5. d. 11. So hast thou also mainteyners of the doctrine. &c. Like as he commēded the Angell of the Church of Ephesus bycause he could not a∣way with euill men,Ouer much forbearing is blamewoorthy in ministers. and bicause he hated the doings of the Nicolaites: so rebuketh he the faithfull of the Church of Per∣gamus, bicause they were not stout ynough in withstanding
such heretikes. S. The doctrine of the Nicolaites is reported to haue bin this: That mens wiues might be vsed in common, and that mē might eate of things offered vnto Idolles with∣out respect. A. The which I hate, see the sixth verse. 16. Amende, or else I vvill come vnto thee shortly, and vvill fight againste them vvith the svvorde of my mouth. Amend, or else I will come vnto thee. &c. S.G. He exhorteth the faithfull that were seduced, to amend betimes,God leaueth not his people vnwarned. & to put away the euil men from among them. Thus we sée how the Lorde was not wont to leaue his seruants in th mire, but rather to lift them vp by the power of his spirit, & by the wholesome ad∣monishment of his word. Or else I will come vnto thee shortly. This is expounded already in the fifth verse.The wicked shall dowtlesse be punished. And will fyght a∣gainst them with the sworde of my mouth. M. That is to say by sholing out the good from the euill, & the righteous frō the vn∣righteous, by the doctrine of the Gospell which procéeded out of the mouth of God. S. He séemeth to allude héere to the sto∣ry of Balaam. For the Angell caried a naked sword, & threat∣ned to destroy him except he repented. But for asmuch as Balaam was stubborne in his wickednesse: there ensewed great vengeance by the sword, both vpon the people of God for defyling themselues with the harlots of the Madianites: and also vpon the Madianites themselues: yea and Balaam also was shamefully slayne among them: of all which thyngs reade Numb. 25. a. 1.2.3. &c. &. 31. a. 8. And out of all doubte the same will happen one day to our Balaamits and Nicolaits also, if they do not repent: according as the Apostle threat∣neth them, Hebr. 13. a. 4. And by the sword of his mouth, he dothe vs to vnderstand, how easy a matter it is for hym too roote out the euill men, euen with the onely blast of hys mouth, the which he therefore lykeneth to a sworde, bycause it deuoureth the vngodly. WhicheA borowed or figuratiue speeche wher∣in a woord or terme is put from his bro∣per significa∣tion to signifi some other thing. metaphor the Scripture vseth oftentimes: as for example to strike with the mouth
of the sword,The weapōs of Chrystes ministers. that is to say, with the edge of the sword, &c. Deut. 13. d. 15. G. By the way we sée with what weap  becommeth the ministers of the Church to be armed, namely with the sword of the spirit, that is to say, with Gods word, that they may be able to ouercome such as talke againste the truth. Tit. 1. c. 9. B. Wherefore they go the wrong way to worke, which desire (yea or indeuer) to beate downe heretik and other enimies of the truth, and yet despise the reading of holy Scripture. 17. He that hath an eare, let him heare vvhat the spirit sayth to the Churches. To him that ouercommeth I vvill giue to eate of the hidden Manna: and I will giue him a vvhite stone, & in the stone a nevv name vvrittē, vvhich no man knovveth sauing he that receyueth it. He that hath an eare. &c. A. Sée the seuenth verse. To him that ouercommeth I will giue to eate of the hidden Manna.Chrystes my∣steries likened too Manna. S. Trimly doth he in this place (wher he treateth of the doctrine of faith) allude to the nature of the Manna, which sauored well vnto the godly mēs tast, according as euery of them was disposed. But the fleshly mē féeling not that tast, founde fault with it, saying: our stomacke lotheth this light meate. Numb. 21. b. 5. Like vnto this is the nature of ye misteries of fayth in ye holy scriptures, which misteries (euē as ye Māna did) do yeld much swéetnesse to ye godly, & to such as vnderstand thē spiritually▪ wheras cōtrariwise the carnal sort loth thē, & returne againe to the fleshpots of Egipt: & so do the Balaamities & Nicolaits. A. Héervpon Paule said, The naturall or fleshly man percey∣ueth not the things that belōg to the spirit of God (for they be foolishnesse vnto him) neither can he know that they are to be iudged spiritually. But the spirituall man. &c. 1. Cor. 2. d. 14. This Manna then is said to be hidden,Gods myste∣ries are not reueled too all men. bycause the secrete of the Lord is reueled, not to al men, but only to them that feare him. Psalm. 25. c. 14. like as Christe sayde to his Apostles, To you it is gyuen to knowe the secretes of the kingdome of
heauen, but vnto them it is not giuen. Math. 13. b. 11. And a∣geyn, I haue called you fréends: for I haue made you priuie to all things, which I haue heard of my father. Iohn. 15. c. 15. This hidden Manna may also signifie Gods goodnesse, which is layde vp as a treasure for all the godlie: according as Da∣uid sayeth, howe great is thy goodnesse, which thou hast layd vp in store for them that feare thée? Psalm. 31. f. 20. and in an other place, Taste yée, and sée yée how swéete the Lorde is. Psalm. 34. b. 9. Looke also in the psalms. 17. b. 7. &. 25. b. 20. for euen nowe we be dead: and our lyfe is hidden in God, with Christ. Coloss. 3. a. 3. For wée scarce perceyue Gods fauoure wherwith he imbraceth vs whyle wee grone for the miseries that are layde vpon vs in this worlde: but yet in the meane whyle the swéetnesse of Gods fatherly louing kyndenesse is shed into our harts by the holie Ghost: wherby it cōmeth too passe, that euen in death we warrant our selues life through the frée fauour of God. I will giue him a whyte stone. S.The preemi∣nence of such as perseuer faithfull too the end. In these woordes there is promised the greatest preheminence of dig∣nitie that can be aboue other, vnto those that get the vpper hand. Like as Ioseph was aduaunced aboue the reste in E∣gypt. Gen. 41. e. 40. Daniel in Babylon, Dan. 2. g. 48. And Mardocheus with king Ahasuerus, Hester. 6. c. 10. Also our Sauiour promiseth preheminence to the faithfull seruaunt, which with the fiue talentes that he had receyued, had gained fiue mo. Math. 25. b. 21. Which selfe same thing is betokened héere by the whyte stone with the new name ingrauen in it. E. For in olde time they gaue verdits by stones:Giuyng of verdictes by stones. whervpon it came to passe yt the things which are allowed, are sayd to be marked with a white stone: & the things that are disalowed, ar said to be marked with a black stone. And in giuing voices at ye choozing of officers, they wer woont to write the name of him whom they fauored, vpon their stone. And in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth. S. He alludeth to the custome of men in choozing men to offices or other grea∣ter dignities: B.Election of officers by stones. where white and blacke stones are wont too
be put togyther into a boxe, & delt out among the compéeres that stand for the electiō. He that lights vpon the white stone, or the stone with the name writen in it, hath ye fortune of pre∣ferment: and only he that receyueth it knoweth it, tyll at length when all the stones be delt out, they be brought foorth to the open vewe.The preroga∣tiue of ye faith∣full in theyr owne consci∣ences. S. Truly the mysterie of the election and sealyng vp of Gods children by the holie Ghoste, séemeth too be ryghte trimly shadowed vnder this figure of spéeche. For although the faithfull séeme not too outwarde appearance too haue any prerogatiue beyond the cōmon lot of men: yet not∣withstanding in their owne féeling, they haue alreadie by the warrant of the holie Ghoste, tasted in the entrayles of their hart, how good and swéete the Lord is. For the spirite whiche dwelleth in them, giueth assurance to their spirit, that they be the childrē of God, and coheires with Christ. Of which mat∣ter sée Rom. 8. d. 17. & Gal. 4. a. 6. &. 2. Cor. 1. d. 22. &. 5. a. 5. & Eph. 1. c. 13. S. In this wyse also Chryst our Sauiour, after hée had suffred the reproch of the Crosse, had giuen vnto him a name yt is aboue al names which are named, not only in this world but also in the world to come. Phil. 1. b. 9. & Ephes. 1. d. e. 21. 18. And to the Angell of the Churche of Thyatyra, vvrite. Thus sayth the sonne of God, vvhich hath eyes as a flame of fire, & vvhose feet ar like vnto fine brasse. And to the Angell of the Churche of Thyatira, write. A. Con∣cerning Thyatira a Citie of Lydia, looke in Act. 16. c. 14. and héeretofore in the first chapter and eleuenth verse. Thus sayth the sonne of God.Chryst is the son of God. S. It is too bée marked heere, that he which heretofore. 1. c. 13. was sayd to be like the sonne of man, is now called the sonne of God: to the intent we myght know, that the selfe same Christ is both the sonne of God, and the sonne of man, G that is too say, verie God and verie man. VVhiche hath eyes as a flame of fyre. S. Forasmuch as he goeth about too persuade men too repent them of their euill woorkes: he doth not amisse too sette before them the countenance and beha∣uiour
of an angrie iudge. Whereof you haue héeretofore. 1. c. 14. And whose feete. &c. Loke afore in. 1. c. 15. 19. I knovve thy vvorkes, and thy charitie, and thy seruisablenesse, and thy faith, and thy patience, and thy vvorkes, and the last mo than the first. I knowe thy workes and thy charitie. G. This Epistle belon∣geth proprely to such Pastors, as leade a holy lyfe themsel∣ues and preache pure doctrine: but yet are not stout inough in withstanding heresies and froward doctrines. And thy cha∣ritie. S. In the faithfull of the Churche of Thyatira,Commenda∣ble in Gods ministers. hee com∣mendeth first the déedes of charitie, namely liberalitie, wat∣chefulnesse, diligence, and faithefulnesse in performing the duetie of their charge or calling, that is to wit, by sound doc∣trine: and secondly their enduring of aduersities for the same doctrine. All whiche thinges are expounded in the seconde, nynth and thirtéenth verses.The end why God prayseth men. And the cause why the people of Thyatira bée commended for these things, is to spurre them forwarde by this singular prayse of their vertuous behauior, to the end they may supplie the things that want, and holde on still to the end in these good workes. A. for that is the mark wherat the prayses ame, whiche the seruauntes of God are woont too giue vnto those to whome they write: according as as it is too bée séene. 1. Cor. 11. a. 2. And the last mo than the fyrst.The faithfull must increase in godlinesse, •. Wée sée howe it is the peculiar duetie of the godlie too pro∣céede dayly in the faith of Christ, and in the loue of their ney∣bor: much lesse then standeth it with their dutie, that the stu∣die of godlinesse shoulde waxe colde, or bée rebated in them. A. And heerevnto also perteine the exhortations of the Apo∣stles, Eph. 4. c. 15. and Coloss. 4. b. 10.11.12. and 2. Peter. 3. d. 18. For like as the vngodly growe euer worse and woorse whyle they bring others intoo error and are deceyued themselues, also: (2. Tim. 3. d. 13.) euen so the godly being led by a cōtrarie spirit, (that is too wit by the holy Ghoste,) must from day too day waxe richer and richer in good workes.
20. But I haue a fevve things against thee: bicause thou sufferest that vvoman Iezabel (vvhich sayeth she is a prophet) to teache and to seduce my seruantes, so as they commit vvhoredome, and eate of the thinges that be offered vnto Idolles. But I haue a fewe things against thee. S.B. Ageyn wée sée how the things that are doon amisse by some particular membres of the Churche, are imputed too the verie gouerners, yea and too the whole Churche. Bycause thou sufferest that woman Ieza∣bel.Fault is foūd that women taughte in the Churche, and that they suf∣fered the secte of the Nico∣laites. A. The holie Ghoste séemeth héere too blame a dubble fault by the mouthe of Iohn: first that the Thyatirens suffered women too speake and too teache in the Congregation, which thing how much it is ageinst the honestie of the Churche and the comlynesse of Christianitie, Paule teacheth. 1. Cor. 14. g. 34.35. &. 1. Tim. 2. d. 11. And secondly for that among those wo∣men, which bosted themselues to bée prophetisses, there were many to be found, which lyked so well of the doctrine of the Nicolaites, that they were not ashamed to publishe it as a truth, and so they seduced manie. For we haue shewed in the xiiij. verse of this chapter, how that the summe of the doctrine of the Nicolaits, was too commit whoredome, and too eate of thinges offered too Idolles. S. Therfore like as he likened the men that were the firste founders and followers of this noy∣some sect, vnto Balaam: euen so concerning the women that folowed and taught the same, he auoucheth them to be like to wicked Iezabel, which reuoked, stablished, and increaced the abhominable seruing of Baal among the people of God.The vngodlie must not one∣ly be shunned but also resy∣sted. 3. Kings. 16. g. 31. G. And we sée by this place, howe it is not y∣nough for vs to shunne the froward companie of the vngod∣ly, vnlesse we also resist them with a stedfast mind according to the gift of our calling:Satan sna∣reth men euen with Scrip∣ture, and with gods benefits. like as the Apostle teacheth. 1. Cor. 5. a. 2. VVhich sayeth she is a Prophet. G. This saying séemeth to giue an incling, that this diuelish secte of the Nicolaites, was brought into the Church vnder some gay pretence of r¦uelation,
as though it had bin grounded vppon the worde of God. And certaynely the sayde lawlesse libertie of whore-hunting whych they tooke to themselues, shrouded it selfe vnder the bond of brotherly loue and Christian communion, as vnder a veyle or a Curtaine. And the eating of the thyngs that were offered vnto Idolles, were easly admitted vnder the pretence of Christian libertie. For in asmuche as Godly∣nesse auoucheth all things to be cleane vnto the cleane: they supposed that there was nothing which might not be done by the faithfull. A. And so is Satan (through his wonderfull wilinesse) wont to spred abroade innumerable errors, and to deceyue the simple sort, euen vnder pretence of Scripture, yea, and of Gods benefites. Whereof there be innumerable examples in the papistrie. 21. And I gaue hir time to repent hir of hir vvhore∣dome, but she repented not. And I gaue hir time. &c. G. The scripture euery where set∣teth out the gentlenesse and long sufferance of God,Gods long sufferance and gentlenesse, and also his rigour. where∣through being forward vnto mercie and slowe to wrath, hée calleth sinners to repentance, that they may receyue forgiue∣nesse of their sinnes and walke in newnesse of lyfe. For hée would not that the sinner shoulde dye, but rather that hée should conuert and liue. Ezech. 18. e. 23. &. 2. Peter. 3. b. 9. S. But if they despise his wholsome counsell of amendement, he exe∣cuteth sore punishment vpon them, like as a man may sée in the old worlde that was before the flud: in the Sodomites: in Dathan, Core, Abyron: and in the Prophetes of Baal: all whych perished miserably for taking skorne to amend. But she repented not.Vnrepen∣tantnesse. Héere is fault found with the wilfulnesse of all such as hauing space to repent them of their sinnes, do vtterly neglect it: yea and rather heape sinne vpon sin, and so hoord vp Gods wrath against themselues, according as it is sayd. Rom. 2. b. 5.
22. Behold I vvill cast hir into a bed, and those that committe fornication vvith hir into exceeding greate trouble, except they repent them of their vvorkes. Behold I will cast hir into a bed. A. There be whiche thynke, that by this manner of spéech,Gods rigoure againste the vnrepentant. is betokened the rest and care∣lesnesse of the vngodly. For the vngodly being sott in pro∣speritie, sléepe a dead sléepe, and take their ease without care, as though they had made a couenant with death and hell, as the prophet sayth, Esay. 28. d. 15. S. But more rightly do others vnderstande it of sodein vengeance: so as, to be layd in bed, should signify as much as to be touched with miserie and tor∣ments. G. bycause that after Gods long sufferance, followeth his sore punishment: for otherwise how should his iustice be apparant vnto men? And those that commit fornication with hir. A. That is to say, which giue their assent to hir froward doctrine, or else passe ouer hir iniquities with their eyes shut. Into exceeding great trouble. This he addeth, to enlarge the sorenesse of Gods vengeance. For it is a dreadfull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God.The generall threatnings of the scrip∣ture implye alwayes a cō∣dition. Hebr. 10. f. 31. Except they re∣pent them of their works. I haue shewed already in the fifthe verse of this Chapter, how the threatnings in the scripture are commonly euermore condicionall. And God is wont too speake so, to the intent the despisers of his grace may be made vtterly vnexcusable, according as it is sayd. Rom. 2. a. 5. 23. And I vvill slea hir children vvith death: and all Churches shal knovv, that I am he vvhich doth search mens reynes and hearts: And I vvill giue to euery one of you according to his vvorks. The maisters of wickednes and their dis∣ciples shall be serued al with ne sauce.And I will slea hir children with death. G. He termeth thē the children of wicked Iezabel, whiche being infected by hir with leawd doctrine, folow horrible abhominatiōs These (saith he) shall be put to death: to the intent we may vnderstande, that
not only the authors of froward sectes shall féele the dreadfull vengeance of God: but also their disciples shall suffer like pu∣nishment. A. Like as if the blind leade the blind, both of them shall fall into the pit. Math. 15. b. 14. Therfore away with these fond spéeches of the Papists, we haue learned these things of our Curats, this manner of worshipping God haue our hygh bishops deliuered vnto vs: it makes no matter to vs whyther it be right or wrong. O miserable blindnesse as who woulde say, that whatsoouer procéedeth from man (who is naturally a lyer) must of necessitie by and by be true, so it shew it selfe in the Church bedecked with some title of dignitie or authoritie. S.Gods iuste vengeance vpon wycked teachers and their follo∣wers. But in this place Iohn séemeth to haue alluded to the story wherein is written the destruction, both of the Prophets and Préests of Baal, and also of Achab and Iezabell, and all the ofspring of them. Concerning which things we reade, firste that there were slayne of Baals prophets, to the number of foure hundred and fiftie: and of the Groue prophets four hun∣dred and fiftie. 3. Kings. 18. g. 40. Secondly that Achab him∣selfe was slayne. 3. Kings. 22. e. 34. Thirdly that Ioram king of Israell the sonne of Achab was slayne. 4. Kings. 9. e. 24. And also Iezabel hirselfe the chéefe murtherer of the prophets was slayne: 4. Kings. 9. g. 33. fourthly, that the .lxx. sonnes of Achab and all the rest of his kinred, togither with all the Pro∣phets and préests of Baal were slayne, and the temple and I∣mage of Baal pulled downe. 4. Kings. 10. b. 11. fifthly that O∣chozias king of Iuda the sonne of Athalia king Achabs daugh∣ter was slayne. 4. Kings. 9. f. 27. Also that Athalia slew all the bloud royall. 4. Kings. 11. a. 1. &. 2. Chronicles. 22. d. 10. Who at length also was hir selfe slayne by Ioiada the Préest, and the temple, Altars and images of Baal ouerthrowen in Iuda, wyth the slaughter of hys Prophetes and préestes, accordyng as Iehu had done in Israell. Thys venge∣ance that was executed vppon the wicked Iezabell and hir whole posteritie, and vppon the Prophets and préestes, Iohn bringeth to remembraunce in feaw wordes. A. too
the end we may know, how Gods terrible vengeance way∣teth vppon all the wicked, but specially vppon deceyuers: of whome ye may find more in .2.The heresi of the Cataphri∣gians and the vengeance that fell vp∣pon them. Pet. 2. a. 1. These thinges may also be meant of the Catapbrigians, that is to wit, of Monta∣nus and his wenches Priscilla and Maximilla, which boasted themselues to haue the spirit of prophesie: whose heresie began anon after, to raunge through the Churches of Asia. Of which heresie Eusebius writeth in the .14. Chapter of his fifth booke of the Stories of the Church and in the Chapters following. And as touching Gods vengeance which fell sore vpon them: the same Eusebius in the .16. Chapter of the sayde booke wry∣teth thus. It is sayd that by the inforcement of the deuill wyth whom they were enspired, euery one of them at sundry times hanged themselues after the example of the traytor Iudas. Besides this,Simon Ma∣gus. Apelles. Simon the Samaritane bare men in hand, that his harlot Selene was the soueraigne mind. Likewise Apel∣les, to make his owne doctrine of credit, alleadged a certayne wench named Philumene, whome he surmised to be ende∣wed with the spirit of prophesie. So also doth Satan euen at this day by his wonderfull crafts and incredible wyles, a∣buse folkes possessed with diuells and Lunatike persons, too purchace credit to the froward inuentions of men, that by that meanes Christes holy Gospell may be put to silence, or rather quite buried among men. Wherefore it becommeth the ministers of Gods woord to watch, that errors bée not so∣wed or creepe not farre abrode in the Churche through their negligence.A proofe of Christes god∣heade. And all Churches shall knowe that I am be. &c. S. G. By this saying as it were by some thunderclap, he meante too skare all hipocrits and heretikes, who go about to beguyle e∣uen God himselfe: as though the wickednesse that lyeth hyd within them, were vtterly vnknowen vnto him. They there∣fore shall knowe by assured proofe, that nothing escapeth the iudge Chryste, but that all thynges are open vnto hym, yea euen the couert thoughts and delights of the minde. A. Here a∣gayne thou hast an assured testimonie of Christes Godhead,
in asmuch as it is the propertie of God alone to searche the heartes and reynes of menne, according too thys say∣ing: Thou onely knowest the heartes of the sonnes of men .3. kings .8. d. 39. G. Also it is to be noted,The maner of Gods puni∣shing & the end whervntoo. that God puni∣sheth not all wicked men in thys lyfe. And yet to the in∣tente to shewe the vprightnesse of hys iudgemente: hee is wont nowe and then to picke some out of the number of them, vppon whome hée vttereth some incling of his wrath: and specially hée punisheth those most gréeuously, that are had in estimation, to the ende that the rest of the despi∣sers of religion may perceyue howe there is horrible ven∣geance layde vp for them, except they repente in season. But if he lay afflictions vppon hys owne children, (whiche thing betideth often) hée dothe it firste to trie them withall: and secondly that the frowarde enimies of the truth maye vnderstande, howe greate punishment they themselues béeing despisers and foes of God are worthy of, séeing that the godly whome God loueth so déerely, and whyche gyue themselues to soundnesse of lyfe, are so sore troubled. For if thys bée done to the gréene trée, what shall be done to the wi∣thered? Luke. 23. e. 31. And if iudgement begin at Gods owne house, what shall be the end of them that beleeue not his Gos∣pell? And if the righteous man is scarce saued, where shal the vngodly and the sinner shew his face? 1. Peter. 4. d. 17. And I wyll gyue too euery one of you according too hys woorkes. B. It is a verye ryfe sentence in the Scriptures,Of woorkes and how they iustifie not. and is miswrested, by such as indeuer to proue, that we bée iu∣stifyed by oure owne workes, bycause we bee iudged ac∣cording too them, whereas notwithstanding there is no suche thyng meant. They consider not that a trée is discerned by hys fruites, and yet that the frute causeth not the trée to bée thys or that, but the trée causeth the fruite to be suche. As for example, when a man sées figges vppon a tree, he iudgeth it too bée a figge trée: and yet the figge tree tooke not his béeing of the figges: but for bycause it was a figge tree,
therefore it brought foorth that kind of frute. Euen so in all kind of things the worke yéeldeth iudgement of the worker, and yet maketh not the worker, but is made or done by the worker. After the same manner, good woorks declare a man to be good and to be the child of God, but they make him not good. A man therefore is not iustifyed (that is to say made ac∣ceptable to God) by works, which can be nothing but sinne to damne him withall, if they be done before he be clenzed and renewed by the holy Ghost, bycause an euil trée cannot bring foorth good frutes. Neuerthelesse, the Lord in describing hys iudgement, sayth (after the manner of man) that the same is executed according to euery mans déedes: verely euen as we bée wont to iudge, and yet by saying that he will gyue to e∣uery one according to his works, he méeneth not to make our works the cheefe cause of our welfare.The causes of euerlasting lyfe. For of his giuing vnto vs eternall life, the firste cause is his owne voluntarie good will: which also is the first cause of all things. The seconde is Christes merites: for he dyed for the welfare of the whole worlde: and yet euen that also is the frée gift of Gods good wyll. The third is fayth, whereby we receiue and embrace the good will of God and the merites of Christ: for he that be∣léeueth hath life euerlasting. Iohn. 3 d. 36. And yet euen fayth also is the worke and gift of God, who is well pleased with vs for Christes deserts. Lastly also good woorks may haue the name of a cause (howbeit vnproperly) bycause euery man is rewarded according to hys woorkes. But yet good woorkes themselues are the gifts of Gods good will, the effects of Chri∣stes merites, and the frutes of fayth. For no worke can bée counted good before God which is not done of loue and good will to Godward: but loue and good will to Godward is in none but such as beléeue in God: and to beléeue in God no man is able but he that is indewed with the holy Ghoste: whych holy Ghost God giueth to those only whome he accep∣teth for his owne children, and whose sinnes he hath forgiuen for Christes sake: but neyther releaseth he any mens sinnes,
nor giueth Christ vnto any other than such as he hath chosen therevnto before the making of the world: And therefore all the parts of our welfare and saluation are the gift and work of Gods owne voluntarie and frée good will. Moreouer it is to be noted, that he saith not, I will giue to euery one of you according to the faith that is hid in his hart (which euery man (be he neuer so wicked) may face men downe that he hathe, and therefore that he ought to be saued:) but according to hys works which cannot be couered and secret, but rather are re∣proued by all mens consciences, so as the faithlesse can in no wise complaine of Christes dealing, for asmuch as euen their owne conscience condemneth them. 24. And I say vnto you,Others reade, and I say to the rest of you that be at Thyatir. and to the residevv of you that be at Thyatira, VVhosoeuer hath not this doctrine and hathe not knovven the depthes of Satan, according as they say: I vvill lay none other burthen vpon you. And I say vnto you and to the residew. &c. S. Nowe he spea∣keth vnto them whose charitie, seruisablenesse, faith, and pa∣tience he commended afore: and also vnto them which though they were not of so great perfection, yet had not consented too the error of Iezabell (that is to say of the Nicolaites and Ca∣taphrigians,) like as those seuen thousand men in the tyme of Helias, whiche had not howed their knées before Baal. 3. Kings. 19. d. 18. &. Rom. 11. a. 4. VVho soeuer hath not this doc∣trine. M. that is to wit,The highnesse or deepnesse of Satan. which the said most mischeuous Iezabel taught: And hath not knowen the depthes of Satan. S. The olde translation hath the height of Sathan, that is to wit, where∣by he extolleth himselfe and wyll bée counted lyke vntoo God. Whyche heygth or hyghnesse they haue not knowen, that is to say, they haue not allowed it for the true seruice of God, although ye deceyuable false prophets haue taught it for the true seruice of God. M. For not to knowe, is as much as not to allow with any consent: lyke as the Lorde auoucheth hymselfe not to know those whome he receyueth
not into his schoole Math. 7. d. 23. &. 25. a. 12. S. Or else Sathans depthes are his hidden and priuie thoughts, séeming good and honest to outward appéerance, when as he transformeth him∣selfe into an Angell of light 2. Cor. 11. d. 14. Like as when hée seduced our firste forefather. Gen. 3. a. 4. And when he presu∣med to tempt Christ the sonne of God. Math. 4. a. 6. &. Luke. 4. a. 2. A. But for asmuch as Paule saythe that he is not ignorant of those déepe thoughtes of Satan. 2. Cor. 2. c. 11. the meaning will be simple, if we take those depthes for some certaine high mysteries: as if he should say, They that haue not knowen those pestilent errors which the heretikes themselues boast to be the déepe mysteries of God, whereas yet notwithstan∣ding they came out of Satans shop. And so the copulatiue And, shoulde (after the manner of the Hebrues) be put in way of exposition: for that is to say. Whervpon also there followeth by and by,The outward peintednesse of hypocrytes. according as they say. It is an ordinarie thing wyth heretikes, to flush out proude words, and to set a gay glosse vp∣pon their errors, to the end to beguile others the easiyer. Of such men Peter speaketh thus: For by sounding out their great and stately woords, they entice men too pleasures by the lustes of the fleshe. &c. 2. Peter. 2.18. Iude also sayeth that their mouth speaketh proud things. Iude. vers. 16. Such are the Li∣bertines and Anabaptists at this day. I will lay none other bur∣then vpon you. S. Although there be some whiche in this place vnderstande the worde Burthen to be meant of the gréefe of mind and bitternesse of hart which the godly should sustayne by reason of his error,Burden. which they should be fayne to endure, till Christ come and deliuer them by his visitation: yet is the place more rightly vnderstoode of the burthen of the law. For we know it was the propertie of heretikes and false Apostles, to burthē yt Church with Ceremonies, whereas contrarywise Christ sayth, my yoke is swéete and my burthen lyght, Math. 11. d. 30. And Peter sayth: why tempt ye God, too lay the yoke vppon the disciples neckes, whyche neyther our fathers nor we haue bin able to beare? Acts. 15. b. 10. And Paule, ye haue
not receiued the spirit of bondage too put you in feare, but ye haue receyued the spirite of adoption. &c. Rom. 8. c. 15. And a∣geine, Stande yée in the freedome wherewith Christe hath made vs frée, and intangle not your selues ageine with the yoke of Bondage. Gal. 5. a. 1. A. The spirit then (by the mouth of Iohn) biddeth the faythfull too bée contented with the onely Gospell of Christe, which they had receyued at the firste too walke in. For seyng it is able too make a man perfecte and readie too all good woorkes. 2. Tim. 3. d. 17. too what purpose should he wishe for newe lawes or constitutions too quiet his conscience withall? 25. Notvvithstanding, that vvhich yee haue, holde it still till I come. Notwithstanding, that which yee haue, holde it still, S. G.No new Gos∣pelles, doctri∣nes, Ceremo∣nies, or consti∣tutions must bee receiued. He wylleth them too holde simplie and vnappayred, the doctrine which they had receiued of the Apostles: according as Paule saythe, O If wée our selues or an Angell from heauen preach any other Gospell, &c. cursed bée he. Gal. 1. b. 8. And if any man come vntoo you and bring not this doctrine, receyue him not too house, neyther byd God speede hym. 2. Iohn. d. 10. There∣fore let these frentike fellowes auaunt wyth theyr Reuela∣tions and iuggling knackes of Satan, whereby the rechlesse and vnstable are easely led awaye from the pure woorde of God. A Let vs not bée as children, too bée wauering and cari∣ed about with euery blast of doctrine, by the wylinesse of men through craftinesse. &c. Ephe. 4. c. 14. Till I come Verely too damne all the vngodly, and too delyuer the godly: as the se∣quele will declare. 26. And he that ouercommeth and keepeth my vvoorkes too the ende, too him vvill I giue povver o∣uer the Gentils. And he that ouercommeth.Constancie. A An exhortation to constancie & soundnesse of life, by annexing a promise. M. He that ouercom∣meth (that is to say) the temptations and prouocations vntoo
sinne, S. and consenteth not to errours of pestilent doctrine. And keepeth my woorkes too the ende. That is too saye, he that earnestly indeuereth too fulfull the things that I haue taught and commanded: namely beléefe in the only one God, loue toward his neighbour, and vtter renouncing of himselfe by bearing of the crosse, liuing soberly, vprightly, and godlily in this naughtie world: which is the only righteousnesse, and the only true worshipping.What seruice is accepted of God. G. And it is to be marked, ye Christ calleth all these things his workes, teaching vs what seruice is acceptable to him: namely not that which men deuise of their owne braine: but that which Christ the Sonne of God hath appoynted, least any man myghte (vnder the colour of good intent) serue God in vaine with the traditions of men, as Hypocrites doo. Esai. 19. d. 14. and Math. 15. a. 9. I will gyue him power ouer the Gentils.Who be Gen∣tiles or heathē. S. G. That is to saye, ouer vnbelée∣uers and ouer all maner of men that bée hild vnder false Re∣ligion, and consequently which lyue leawdly and without the feare of God. Concerning whom, looke Ephe. 2. c. 12. &. 4. e. 18.19. &. 1. Thess. 4. a. 5. &. 1. Pet. 4. a. 3.4.5. A. For lying must one day néedes sinke vnder truth: Satan, vnder Christ: and the vngodly vnder the godly. S. Which thing is done partlye at this present, and partly at the ende of the world. At this pre∣sent, when men acknowledge their errours at the preaching of the Gospell, and receiue the truth: according as it is sayde Psalm. 2. c. 9. and 110. a. 6.7. So dyd Dauid at length after many tribulations succéede Saule in the Kingdome. Sée the Psal. 110. b. 6.7. &. Luke. 1. e. 52. And in the end of the world the faithfull shall haue full victorie of all their aduersaries. Mat. 19. d. 28. &. 1. Cor. 6. a. 2. Whatsoeuer the head hathe tht hath the body also.27. And he shall rule them vvith an yron rod, and they shal be broken as a potters vessels. And he shall rule them with an yron rod. A. This agréeth pro∣perly vntoo Christ, as it is shewed in the person of Dauid,
Psalm. 2. c. 9. P. but the Church hath this power in Christ, as the bodie in the head. For if a man cleaue too his body wor∣thily, he is rightly sayde too haue that thing which the sonne of man possessed by right of inheritance: in whom God hath gyuen vs all things, as Paule witnesseth, Romains. 8. f. 32. B.Christes yron mace. The yron mace wherewyth Christ is armed too breake his enemyes in péeces, is his words, as it appeareth by Esai. 11. a. 4. Whose seruauntes are the Pastors or shepeherdes: not onely too put the enemyes in feare, but also too beate them downe, according as Paule teacheth 2. Cor. 10. a. 4. And they shall be broken as a potters vesselles. q. d.The weak∣nesse of the vngodly. The power that I will gyue my seruauntes ouer the heathen, shall bée suche, as the wicked shall no more bée able too hurte them, than a Pot∣ters vessel can hurt a mace of yron, if it should rise vp against it. A. Great then is the comforte of all the godly, consideryng how they knowe that those proude Gyantes which go about too oppresse the Churche, are no better than potters vessells, which are very easely broken. Such maner of men then doo but spit against heauen (as the prouerb sayth) whose cace is all one with his that plucketh downe a great stone frō alofte vpon his owne head, wherwithall he is crushed all too péeces. For when the persecuters of the Churche thinke themselues to haue won the gole, and to haue dispatched their matters, & to bée quite out of gunneshot, then are they neerest a shrewd turne, and then is hastie vengeance readie to light vpō their heads. Therfore like as this lesson strengtheneth vs agaynst the furious assaultes and boystousnesse of the vngodly, who shall come to a terrible end at the length: euen so, it teacheth vs to yéelde ourselues méeldly with a soft and lyght hart vn∣to Christ to be tamed by him. 28. Euen as I haue receiued of my father:The godlie shall be parta∣kers of Chri∣stes glorie. so vvill I also giue him the morning starre. Euen as I haue receiued of my father. A. These wordes are spoken according to Christes manhood: in respect wherof he
is wonte too attribute all things too his father, G. And by thys place he sheweth howe the faithfull shall be partakers of the kingdome which he nowe inioyeth. Rom. 8. d. 17. &. 2. Tim. 2. b. 11. which thing must asswage all the bitternesse of ye Crosse as ofte as wée shall bée driuen too suffer anye thing for hys names sake.The morning starre. So will I also giue him the morning starre. S. That is too say, I wil make him glorious aboue all others, lyke as that starre is bryghter than the rest: according as the Pro∣phet sayth. And they that instruct many vntoo righteousnesse. &c. Dan. 12. a. 3. B. And Paule saythe, that one starre differeth frō another in bryghtnesse. 1. Cor. 15. e. 41. Howbeit, the simple meanyng of this place is, that althoughe the faithfull be sub∣iecte too sundrye slaunders, and to wrongs at many mennes hands: yet will God bring foorth their righteousnesse intoo the open face of the world, lyke too the morning starre, accor∣ding as it is written in Psalm. 37. a. 6. and Esai. 58. c. 8. 29. He that hath an eare. &c. M. He exhorteth men too heare and fulfill the things that are gone afore. Sée the se∣uenth verse of this Chapter. The thirde Chapter. ANd too the Angell of the Churche that is at Sar∣dis, vvrite. Thus saythe he that hathe the seuen Spirites of God, and the seuen starres. I knovve thy vvorkes, [that is too say] that thou hast the name to bee aliue, and art dead. The Churche of Sardis.ANd too the Angell of the Church that is at Sardis. A. Now foloweth the fifth Epistle, directed too the pastors of the church that was at Sardis. For Sardis looke afore in the eleuēth verse of the first Chapter. S. Among the Bishops of this
Church there goeth great renoume of one Melito,Melito. a man ve∣rie well learned and godly therwithall. Among many volu∣mes which he did put foorthe, hée wrate one Apologie in de∣fence of the Christen profession to Antonine Vere Emperor of Rome. Also he wrate an other vpon the Apocalips of sainct Iohn, as Ierome witnesseth in his register of Ecclesiasticall writers. And Eusebius writeth many thinges of him in the xxvj. Chapter of the fourthe booke of his Ecclesiasticall histo∣rie. Of this Melito, Polycrates bishoppe of Ephesus (togy∣ther with the rest of the Bishops of Asia) maketh mention in these words to Victor bishop of the Churche of Rome. What néedeth it (saye they) too make mention of Sagaris bishop & Martir, who slepeth in Laodicea, and of blissed Papyrias, and of Melito the Eunuch in the holie Ghoste, who alwayes ser∣ued the Lord, and is buryed in Sardis, looking to ryse ageyn at his comming? Thus muche out of Hierome in his regi∣ster: But it is not wel knowen, eyther who went afore this Melito, or who succeeded him in the ministerie of the sayde Churche. G. Moreouer by this Epistle are blamed all hypocri∣tes and false christians, who being voyde of liuely faith,What is mēt by the spirites of God. vaūt themselues to be faithfull people, and worshippers of God. Thus saith he that hath the seuen spirits of God. S. G. Sith Christ is he which quickneth the dead: in this place where be inten∣deth to quicken the dead, he doth aryght to glory, that he hath the spirit of lyfe in his hand, that is to say in his power. For the sonne of God giueth life to whom he listeth. Iohn. 5. d. 21. And it is the spirite that quickeneth Iohn. 6. g. 63. That is to saye, the power of the Godhead whiche lyeth hidde in the flesh, is it that quickeneth: but the fleshe alone without the power of the Godhead hidden in it, coulde doe no such thing at all. Rightly therfore shall we take these seuen spirites, to be that seuen shapen spirite which Chryste giueth, that is too say, the whole number of Gods gifts, by whiche the Church is garnished and made perfecte. Onlesse that by the seuen spi∣rites, some man had leuer to vnderstand the whole araye of
the heauenly spirites, by whose inuisible working, Chryst disposeth and gouerneth the affaires of his Churche: or else the gouerners of the church, so as the seuen spirits, & the seuē starres should be al one thing: according too that which is said alredie, the seuen starres are the Angels of the seuen Chur∣ches, before. 1. d. 20. A. And so the copulatiue And, shall be ta∣ken for that is to say, like as it is in manie other places. And truly sometimes the name of spirit is conueyed ouer too pro∣phets or teachers, bicause they glorie of the spirite, and beare out themselues vnder that title vnto the people. Of whiche thing sée.Starres. 1. Tim. 4. a. 1. &. 1. Iohn. 4. a. 1.2.3. And the seuen star∣res. Why this name is giuē to the pastors of Churches. I haue shewed afore.Workes. 1. d. 16.20. I know thy works. All things bée they good or bad, are naked & apparant vnto Christes eyes. Looke afore.Counterfeat Christianitie. 2. a. 2. That is to say, That thou hast the name to bee alyue and art dead. S. G. He findeth fault with the Sardians, chiefly for that they made a shewe of Christianitie in certayne out∣warde rites and ceremonies, but were ignorant of the power of it: insomuch as they played the singular hipocrites, & were but whited Sepulchres, as Christe termeth the Pharisies, Math. 23. c. 27. S. After the same maner dothe Paule also call the liuing widdowe dead, which liueth in pleasures. 1. Tim. 5. a. 6. bicause that whereas in profession and outwarde shewe she promiseth holinesse, shée foloweth pleasure by the same shifte. And héereby wée learne, first that all those are dead, which want the fayth of Christ. For Christ only who is the euerlasting life. (1. Iohn. 5. d. 11.) quickeneth vs by fayth: in∣so muche that to knowe Christ aright, and to possesse him by fayth, is to haue euerlasting life. Iohn. 17. a. 3. and to pretend him but only in name, is to be dead, for he that beléeueth not, abideth in death, bicause the wrath of God resteth vpon him. Iohn. 3. d. 36. And he that hath not the sonne of God, hath not life.Spirituall fayth, and hi∣storical faith. 1. Iohn. 5. b. 12. That fayth whiche is put into mans minde by the spirite of God, is a moste liuely and workefull thing: but contrariwise, that fayth and beléefe which is histo∣ricall, and differeth nothing from opinion, is euermore
accompanyed with drowsynesse and dulnesse. G. And therfore the profession of the christen religion consisteth not in bare ceremonies or outward workes, but in the earnest feare of God, and in faith that worketh by charitie. Gal. 5. a. 6.That whiche is not before God, is as good as no∣thing at all. Agein it is too bée considered, that there is farre oddes betwixte the iudgement of God, and the iudgement of men: in so muche as it oftentymes betydeth, that the thing which men haue in high estimation, is abhominable before God. Luke. 16. d. 15. Therefore the thing that is not before God, howe muche soeuer it séeme too be before menne, is sayd in the Scripture not too bée at all. So was Dauid a kyng before God, euen when hee was an outlawe, thoughe in the meane tyme Saule reygned as Kyng to the outewarde appearaunce of the worlde, and yet perfourmed not the office of a Kyng, whyche Dauid perfourmed all that whyle. For Dauid van∣quished the enimies of Gods people, defended the realme, and succcoured suche as were oppressed with debte when they fled vnto him: all which things perteyned to the charge of a king. So Christe did in very déede supply the roome of the highe Priest, and expounder of the lawe before God, and contrarywyse the Priests, although they bare the of∣fice of the priesthood afore the worlde, yet bycause they were vtterly voyde of the holy Ghost, they performed none of the things whiche the spirite required by those outwarde things. A. Whervpon before God they were estéemed not only as vn∣worthy of the Priesthood, but also as dead men. S. Wherfore let no man rashly giue sentence concerning election or repro∣batiō by the outward works, séeing that the same things may happen both to the godly & the vngodly. Preacher. 9. a. 2. 2. Bee avvake, and strengthen the residue vvhiche vvere readie to dye. For I haue not found thy vvorks full before God.A caueat too suche as haue gift to edifie withall. Bee awake. G. Quicken vp the other gifts of the holy Ghost by fayth and holding out, (which giftes will dye and vanishe
away out of hand, except liuely faith & charitie reskue them) suche as prophecying, the knowledge of tungs, and certaine other giftes bée, which now and then are bestowed euen vp∣pon the reprobates, as vpon Balaam, Nume. 22. a. 5. Vppon Saule. 1. Sam. 10. b. 10. vpon Cayphas, Iohn. 11. g. 51. & vpon Iudas, Math. 10. a. 4. A. Wherfore let suche as haue recey∣ued spiritual gifts, take very good héed that they abuse them not, least the thing that was giuen them to the common edi∣fying of the Churche turne to their owne damnation.Diligence and watchfulnesse And strengthen the residue which were readie to dye, that is too saye, strengthen thou with purenesse of doctrine and soundnesse of lyfe, those whiche are sicke of the same disease that thy selfe art. S. For when the gouerners and elders of the Church are benommed, and serue slouthfully in their charges, the things that were bred vp by other folkes diligence, doe dye agayne. Whervpon Paule sayd: I haue planted, Apollo hath wate∣red. &c. 1. Cor. 3. b. 6. And Christ sayth vnto Peter, And thou when thou art returned, strengthen thy brothers. Luke. 22. d. 32. A. Also the Apostles were wont too visite the Churches whiche they had gained vntoo Chryst, too the intente that the séede of the Gospell that had ben sowen, myght not perishe, but that the godlie might be strengthened more and more in the faith, and leade a lyfe beséeming Christen folke. Acts. 14. d.The differēce betweene the woorks of the godly and the woorkes of the vngodly. 23. For I haue not founde thy workes full before God. G. Christ examineth the woorkes as well of the faithfull as of the hy∣pocrites, bicause the father hath put ouer all iudgement vn∣to him. Iohn. 5. e. 27. S. Héere is complaint made, that the Sar∣dians want faith, I meane liuely and effectuall faith: accor∣ding to this saying, this people honoreth mée with their lips, but their harte is farre from mée. Esa. 29.13. and Math. 15. a. 8. Also they beleeue for a whyle, and starte backe in the tyme of tryall. Luke. 8. b. 13. And ageyn, they professe themselues too know God, but they denie him in their déedes. Titus. 1. d. 16. Moreouer, he that hathe the substaunce of this worlde, and séeth his brother lacke. &c. 1. Iohn. 3. c. 17. G. Notwithstan∣ding
it is too bée noted, that the woorkes of the faithfull are not found to bée full (that is too say perfecte) before God, but by imputation. For inasmuche as they bée doone in the faith of Iesus Chryst, who hath performed perfect obedience to the lawe: they also be accepted of God himselfe, as perfect. But forasmuche as the hipocrites doo by their woorkes ey∣ther stablishe deseruyng, or hunt for the prayse of men, or at least wyse woorke them for feare of punishment: their wor∣kes procéede not of fayth, whiche séeketh ryghtuousnesse on∣ly in Christe. Wherfore they bée stinking and lothsome be∣fore God, although that in mens eyes they be accounted very excellent, yea and worthie ryght greate reward. S. The wor∣kes therfore whiche bée full afore God, are suche as be doone of intent to aduaunce Gods glorie, and to winne the soules of oure brethren vnto him, and so are doone hartilye, syn∣cerely, and vtterly withoute all manner of glozing: accor∣ding as Paule teacheth, the end of the law is charitie or loue from a pure hart and a good conscience, and an vnfayned faith 1. Tim. 1. a. 5. G. And Christ sayth, Let your light so shyne be∣fore men, as they maye sée your good woorkes, and glorifye your father which is in heauen. Math. 5. b. 16. And Iohn: my little children, let vs not loue in woord and in tung, but in déede and in truthe. For by this wée knowe that wée be of the truth, and shall perswade our owne harts in his syght. 1. Iohn 3. c. 18.19. P. Too bée short, like as it is not ynough for a trée too liue and bée gréen, onlesse it also bring forth due frutes: so is it not ynough to bée called a Christian, & after a sorte to professe Christ, and yet to vtter no frutes beséeming a christen man. A. Sée Iames. 2. c. 17. and so to the end of that chapter, where these things be both trimly and largely discussed. 3. Beare in mind then, in vvhat sort thou haste recei∣ued and herd, & kept it, & repent. For if thou vvatche not, I vvil come to thee like a theef, and thou shalt not knovv vvhat houre I will come vnto thee.
The pure do∣ctrine must be helde fast.Beare in mind then. S. Bycause they had not earnestly obser∣ued the doctrine deliuered by the Apostels: now he exhorteth them too applye themselues diligently vnto it, and too defend it against the assaults of the false Apostles and deceyuers, and to maintayne the things stoutly, which they had gottē by the trauell of the Apostles, and to indeuer by all meanes to amēd things neglected. A. Wherby we learne, how this one thing ought to be looked vnto inespecially in the Churche, namely that the faithfull may not by any meanes steppe aside from the purenesse of doctrine and playne meaning of the scripture according as the Apostle saithe. 2. Cor. 11. a. 3.4. &. 2. Timo. 4. c.Of hearing & receyuing. 14. In what sort thou hast receiued and heard. Order seemed too require that he should haue said, In what sort thou hast heard and receiued. For a man must néedes first heare the doctrine, before he cā receyue it, according to that which Christ sayth, euery one that heareth these sayings of me, and doth them. &c. Math. 7. d. 24. Also, happie are they that heare the woorde of God and keepe it. Luke. 11. d. 28. Ageine, he that heareth my woord and beléeueth him that sent me. &c. Iohn. 5. d. 24. Vn∣lesse any man had leuer to take Hearing to be put for obeying, as it is put in many other places. And keepe it. C. To kéepe Gods word or commandement is to frame a mans selfe and his whole life according to the same. Herevnto perteyneth the parable of the Talents.Preaching to the dead. Math. 25. b. 15. And repent. Must repentance then be preached to the dead? For looke whom he calleth héere to repentance, them did he in the last verse call dead men. The cace standeth thus. Certesse repentance is preached to suche as are dead, howbeit of the spirituall death, and not of the bodyly death: after whiche sort Christ himselfe sayd, The houre shall come, and it is euen now, that the dead shall héere the voyce of Gods sonne, and they that héere it shal liue. Iohn. 5. e. 25. And Paule: and whereas you were dead in the misdéedes and sinues wherin ye walked in times past. &c. Ephes. 2. a. 1.2. Also, they become straungers to the lyfe of God, by reason of the ignorance that is in them through the
blindnesse of their owne harts. &c. Ephes. 4. e. 18. To such ma∣ner of dead men must repentance be preached, that they may haue remission of sinnes by turning vnto God, and be made partakers of ye happie life. For if thou watch not.Restinesse and sloth. It is a thret∣ning against such as are restie and flothfull. Truly conside∣ring how Satan the enimie of the Church walketh about cō∣tinually like a roring Lion séeking whome he may deuoure 1. Peter. 5. c. 8. it behoueth not only the pastors, but also al the faithfull to kéepe watch, least he fall vppon them vnwares and destroy them. I vvill come vnto thee. G.Christes dou∣ble comming. Christe is saide too come, eyther when he punisheth any man with some seuerall affliction, or with death: or when he is sayde to come to hys last iudgement. Such manner of comming is so muche the terribler to all the vngodly, as they haue the more carelesly despised God, and giuen ouer themselues to the pleasures of this world. And therefore heere is added, that the Lorde wyll come vnto them as a Theefe: bycause they shall be oppressed with vengeance when they looke least for it. Sée the same si∣militude Math. 24. d. 50. &. 25.13. &. Mark. 13. d 33.35. &. Luke. 12. e. 36.40. &. 1. Thessa. 5. a. 3. &. 2. Peter. 3. c. 10. And thou shalte not know what houre I will come vnto thee. This belongeth to the wicked children of darknesse. For the faithfull (which are the children of light and of the day) do gladly wayte for the com∣ming of the iust iudge, not only day by day, but also houre by houre, that their redemption may be made full and perfect in all points. Concerning which thing, sée Luke. 21. f. 28. &. 1. The. 5. a. 4. &. 2. Timo. 4. b. 8. &. 2. Pet. 3. c. 11. 4. Thou hast a fevve names yet in Sardis, vvhiche haue not defyled their garments, and they shall vvalke vvith me in vvhites: for they are vvorthy. Thou hast a few names yet in Sardis. S. He giueth vs to vn∣derstande, that this rebuke lighteth not vppon the whole Churche, but vppon some certaine of the Churche: least it might discourage the hartes of the good. And a feawe names
are put for a fewe persones.Names for persones. A. This manner of speaking is taken of the cōmon trade of men, who in chosing of officers, mustering of souldyers, and conueying of inheritances, are woont too cyte the parties by name out of a booke. Vnto which maner the scripture doth oftentimes allude, where it maketh often mention of names written in heauen, and in the booke of lyfe. A fewe names therefore are as much to say as a few persons: that is to say, a few whom I know by name, whose faith and conuersation I like of, and whom I loue. For looke whom we loue, and specially whom we vouchsafe to haue in estimation, we call them by their proper names, and that with some stile of honour. G. And by this and such like places it is gathered, that the number of the chosen is small in res∣pect of the reprobates: in consideration wherof, Chryst cal∣led his flocke a little flocke. Luke. 12. d. 32. And in an other place, Manie (sayeth he) are called, but few chosen. Math. 20. b. 16. and. 22 b. 14. whiche maketh against those that ground themselues vpon multitudes. VVhich haue not defyled theyr garmentes. S. that is to say, haue not consented to the errours of vngodlinesse, to steppe aside from the simple doctrine of the Apostles, and the pure seruice of God. For thus was it sayde to Salomon:Staynes be foulest in goodlyest thinges. thou hast bestayned thyne owne glorie: bicause he had builded Temples vnto Idols for his straunge wyues sakes. 3. Kings. 11. b. 11. for a stayne séemeth no where fowler than in silke: nor than in suche as boaste themselues to bée Gods people: and specially in those that are rulers ouer the reste. Whervnto perteyn the things that ar writtē in Leui. 21. b. 9. &. 1. Tim. 3. a. 2. G. Here we sée bow God did neuer so for∣sake his churche, but that among the vnbeléeuers, there re∣mayned always some (though but a few) that were indued wyth the holy Ghost, and the earnest feare of God. Of which matter sée Ro. 11. a. 1. And they shal walk with me in whites. The white colour serueth for innocencie and victorie,Chrysts ver∣tues are cōmon to all his members. & therwithal also for felicitie. A. Therfore to walk with Christ in whites, is too lyue innocentlye and vnblamably: whiche is the peculiar
propertie of those that belong to the body of Christ: according as it is sayd in another place, euery one that hath this truste in him, purifyeth or clenseth himselfe, like as he also is cleane pure. And ye know how he appéered to take away our sins, & and there is no sinne in him. 1. Iohn. 3. a. 3.5. For it is not sayd of Christes person only, that there is no sinne in him, but also it is sayd of his whole body. For wheresoeuer Christe shed∣deth out his force, there is no more roome for sinne. And ther∣fore such as belong to the body of Christ, are said not to sinne. B. Truly it is a great commendation for those feaw, that a∣mong so many defyled persons, they abide in vnspotted gar∣ments through the continuall brightnesse of their vertues. P. Where vnto belong the saying of Sainct Paule. Philp. 2. b. 15. G. And that procéedeth of the loue wherewith Christ loueth his Church. For whatsoeuer things Christ doth, they turne to the profit and glory of the godly: in somuch as euen the glory of Christ himselfe is extended vnto them: according as he a∣uoucheth that his Apostles shall iudge the twelue tribes of Israel, Mat. 19. d. 28. When notwithstanding, his father hath appointed him to be iudge both of the quicke and the deade. Act. 10. g. 42. For they be worthy. M. G.Worthinesse. Not by reason of theyr owne works, but by méere grace. For they haue not any good∣nesse, which they haue not receyued of God. 1. Cor. 4. b. 7. 5. He that ouercommeth shall be clothed in vvhyre raymēt, and I vvill not vvipe his name out of the booke of lyfe, but I vvill confesse his name before my father, and before his Angelles. He that ouercommeth shall bee clothed with white raymente. A. Alwayes he exhorteth to perseuerance and stedfastnesse, least any man might quayle in the middes of his race. Looke afore. 2. b. 7. And I will not wipe his name out of the booke of life.Booke of lyfe and who bee written in it. G. To be wiped out of the booke of life, is as much as not too be reckened among the liuing, blissed and happie sort. For the booke of lyfe is nothing else but the register of the righteous,
which are foreordeyned vnto life, according as Moyses saith. R Exod. 32. g. 32. And as it is written in the Psalme. 69 d. 29. and in Daniel. 12. a. 2. and hereafter. 21. g. 27. G. This Register doth God reserue in his owne kéeping: and therefore it is no∣thing else but his eternall determination fore purposed in hys brest. In like maner Dauid sayth, Let them be wyped out of the booke of the liuing, and let them not be registred among the righteous. Psalm. 69. d. 29. that is to say, let them not bée reckened among Gods chosen, whome he allotteth to the pos∣session of his Church and kingdome. In this booke of life, that is to say, in this election or choyce, determination, purpose, knowledge, or predestination of God, there is not registred any misbeleeuing Turke, any wicked Iew, any vnrepentant naughtipacke, nor any stubborne hypocrit, vnlesse they turne to the Lord and acknowledge Christ the only sonne of God. For none be writtē in it but such as beléeue aright in Christ. And that we may reade this booke,How to reade our names in the booke of lyfe. we néede not to climb vp into heauen with the worldly wise men, to search out Gods secrets: but we must come with the plaine shepeherds to the Oxe stall where Christ lay, Luke. 2. c. 16. We must looke vp∣pon Christ, who is become man, and was crucifyed and put to death for vs: and if we find ourselues in Christ, then do we reade our owne name written in the booke of life. A. For hée that beléeueth in the sonne of God hath euerlasting life. Iohn 3 d. 36. And hée shall not come to damnation, but is passed from death into life.Cowardlines or faynthar∣tednesse. Iohn. 5. d. 24. S. And in this place Chrysts meaning is, that he whiche ouercommeth not, but like a weakling and coward shrinketh in this incounter by consen∣ting vnto wicked error, shall be cast away with shame, and haue his name striken out of the booke of life. But I will con∣fesse his name. A. Thys is added for the comfort of the godly, that they shoulde not shrinke for the shame of the world, sée∣ing they shall bée partakers of all one glory with Christe. Looke Math. 10. d. 32.33.
7. And to the Angell of the Churche of Philadel∣phia, vvrite: Thus sayth he that is holy and soothfast, vvhich hath the key of Dauid: vvhich openeth and no man shutteth: and shutteth and no man openeth. And to the Angell of the Church of Philadelphia. S. Concerning Philadelphia looke afore. 1. c. 11. There is an Epistle vnto this Church written by sainct Ignatius the Martir,Ignatius. wherein hée treateth of Christs Godhead togither with his manhood, a∣gainst the pestilent heresies of Simon Magus and Ebion, and moreouer against the vnlawfull minglings of the Nico∣laites. And it were to be wished that such Epistles mighte be had out of the original greeke copies. For (as it appéereth) those that be commonly abroade in mens hands, seeme to bée corrupted in certaine places by the Bishops of Romes mini∣sters, to stablish their owne supremacie ouer all men. Thus saith he that is holy and soothfast. G.Why Christ is termed ho∣ly. Christe Iesus is properly tearmed holy and soothfast, bycause that all other things, yea euen the starres of the skye, are defyled and vntrue, in com∣parison of him. For his excellencie aboue all creatures is in∣finite, and he only is worthy to haue all honor and glory yéel∣ded vnto him. For he is God blissed for euer. Rom. 9. a. 5. B. Moreouer he only is holy in respect of hys manhood, bycause that being segregated from the number of sinners, he alwais performed the things that pleased his father, and became o∣bedient vnto him, euen to the death, he did no sinne, neyther was there any guile found in his mouth. Heb. 7. d. 26. & Iohn. 8. d. 29. & Philip. 2 a. 8. &. 1. Pet. 2. d. 22. Héereby also hath he re∣concyled vs vnto God, and obtayned fauor and grace at hys hande for vs, becomming oure righteousnesse and holy∣nesse. 1. Cor. 1. d. 30. To be shorte, he is worthely tearmed the holy of holyes. Daniel. 9. b. 24. S. Also he is called Sooth∣fast, bycause hée onely teacheth vs true, certayne,Why Christ is called soothfast. substan∣ciall, and infallible thinges: and therefore he auoucheth him∣selfe to be the truth it selfe. Iohn. 14. a. 6. G. & only scolemaster.
Math. 23. a. 8. Whome all men ought to giue eare vnto, euen by the commaundement of the father. Math. 17. a. 5. S. C. Also God is said to be soothfast, bycause he kéepeth touch in his pro∣mises, notwithstanding mens iniquities. Ro. 3. a. 3.4. VVhich hath the key of Dauid.The key of Dauid. or the keyes of the Churche. C. that is to say ful power ouer ye throne of Dauid, that is to wit, ouer the Church. S. For the mataphor of keys, (not only in the scripture but also by the custome of men) betokeneth the full authoritie and ordering of a king∣dome, or a Citie, or a house: such as Ioseph had in the Realme of Pharao king of Egipt, & Eliakim in the house of the kyng of Iuda, according as it is said, B. I will lay the key of Dauids house vpon his shoulder: he shall open, and no man shall shut: and he shall shut, and no man shall open. Esay. 22. f. 22. Euen so Christ our Lord being of the séede of Dauid according too the flesh, hath all power in the kingdome of the heauenly fa∣ther. G. For looke whome the father hath foreordeyned vntoo saluation, them receyueth Christ into his flocke (that is to say into the Church) and thrusteth the rest out of the dores: hée openeth the vnderstanding of his seruants, that they may bée enlightned and vnderstand the scriptures: the rest he blindeth by his secret (howbeit rightfull) Iustice. A. Wherevppon he sayth, All things are deliuered me by my father, Math. 11. d. 27. And againe, All power is giuen vnto me both in heauen and in earth Math. 28. d. 18. And the Angell said vnto Mary, The Lord will giue him the seate of his father Dauid, and he shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his reigne there shall be none end. Luke. 1. c. 32.33. To him alone therefore doth it apperteyne to rule the Church whereof he is the head: which thing he doth euen now by the seruice of hys ministers, to whome he hath therefore promised the keys of the heauenly kingdome, to the intent they shoulde set open the way for the Godly vntoo Heauen, and shut the vnbeléeuers out of Heauen,Election, cal∣ling, and en∣lightening. by the preaching of the Gos∣pell, VVhych openeth and no man shutteth. By these wordes hée meaneth that all thynges are ratifyed whatsoeuer
Christ doeth in the gouernment of the Churche, according as hath bin said of Eliakim out of the Prophete Esai. B. When Christ hath determined too call any nation too the kingdome of heauen by the preaching of his word, there is no man that can withstand him, that the Gospell shoulde not bée preached vnto them. Wherevpon, when the residue woondered at the calling of the Gentils, wée reade that Peter answered thus: Seyng God hath giuen them the like gifte as he hath gyuen vnto vs whē wée had beléeued in the Lord Iesus Christ, who was I that I should resist God? Acts. 11. c. 17. And shetteth and no man openeth.Reprobation, hardening, blynding and darkening. Like as Christ taketh vpon him the charge of his electe, defending them, cherishing them, inlightening them, and by his spirit teaching them the things that belong to the atteinment of saluation: so leaueth he the reprobates and suche as are none of his shéepe, in their owne naturall blyndnesse, and sheweth that they bée excluded out of Gods Kingdome. For thus sayde he to his Disciples: vnto you it is giuen to knowe the secretes of the kingdome of heauen, but vnto them it is not giuen. Math. 13. b. 11. 8. I knovve thy vvorkes. Behold I haue set a doore open afore thee, and no man can shut it: bycause thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my vvorde, and hast not denied my name. I knowe thy workes. S. This is spoken in way of commenda∣tion according as the sequele sheweth.A doore ope∣ned. Behold I haue set a dore open afore thee. Paule glorieth that a doore was opened vnto him, 2. Cor. 2. c. 12. that is to say, that occasion was giuen hym by Gd, whereby to enter into the heartes of the heathen by the word of the Gospell. In this wise must this present place bée taken: namely that Christ had opened a way, whereby the Church of Philadelphia might allure other Churches too the faith of Christ by hir owne example, how much so euer their aduersaries brabbled against them, whither they were Iewes, or Gentils, or false Apostles. And therfore by saying,
and no man can shut it, his meaning is this: namely, no man shall bée able to let you, but that you shall preferre my Gos∣pell vnto manie. S. So at this day there is a great doore set o∣pen vntoo Gods seruaunts, while the Antichristes and perse∣cuters burst asunder: that is to saye, the way is opened for them to enlarge the boundes of Christes kingdome by prea∣ching his worde, and to beate downe the grosse errors of vn∣godlinesse, by the brightnesse of the Gospel, G. bicause yt when God determineth too inlarge the borders of Christes Kyng∣dome,Christes gos∣pell can not be stopped or sup¦pressed by mā. there is no power so highe that is able too let it. By∣cause thou hast a little strength. S. It is a rendering of the cause q. d. forasmuch as thou hast a desire to bring many to ye doctrin of ye Gospel, whervnto notwithstanding thou féelest thy selfe not to haue strength ynough by reason of ye stoutnesse & mul∣titude of thine aduersaries: behold I haue set ye doore open be∣fore thée, yt thou maist perce vnto ye harts of those whō I haue chosen vnto me, euen maugre thine aduersaries. Here vntoo perteineth that which Christ speaketh of a little doue, & of a graine of musterdséede, Luke. 13. d. 19. e. 21. And also ye parable of ye Talents. Namely yt such as vse wel the gifts ye God hath bestowed vpon thē be they neuer so smal, shal receiue greater giftes.Some edifie more with small giftes, than other some do with many & great. Mat. 25. b. 21. G. Also this smal power, strēgth or vertue may betokē lowlinesse or abacing of thēselues, or the scarce∣nesse of ye gifts of the holy Ghost. For they be not delt to al mē alike, but according as the holy Ghost thinketh méete. A. And yet it oftētimes falleth out, yt some do more good with slender gifts of the spirit, thā othersome do with singular & excellent gifts. For the ambition and lewdnesse of many men wil not suffer the spirit which is ye giuer of their giftes, to vtter forth his power in them. Wherfore let no man stand in his owne conceit nor flatter himself for the diuersitie and great number of his giftes: but loke what gifts euery man hath receiued of God, let him modestly & reuerently apply the same to ye com∣mon edifying of the Church. And hast kept my word. What it is to kéepe the word of the Lorde, I haue told alreadie, in the
third verse of this present chap. And hast not denyed my name. This part of the commendation fighteth openly ageinst such as teache,Fayth by im∣plication. that it is ynough for men to haue a certeine fayth which they terme a faithe or beleefe by implication: as who should say, it were ynough for thée to protest that thou belée∣uest as the Church beléeueth: and in ye meane while to be vt∣terly ignorant, not only what the Church beléeueth, but also what the Church is. For the Lord requireth a far other beléef at the hands of those yt be his: namely that we should knowe him, and confesse his name openly as oft as néede requireth, for we be iustifyed by beleeuing in hart, & saued by confessing with the mouth. Rom. 10. b. 10. Also sée. 1. Petr. 3. c. 15. 9. Beholde I sende of the Synagog of Satan, vvhich say they bee Ievves and are not, but lie: beholde I vvill compell them to come and vvorship at thy feete, and to knovve that I haue loued thee. Beholde, I sende of the Synagog of Satan. A.The fruite of preaching. In this place is foretolde the fruite of the doctrine which Christes seruaunts doo preache, (in déede) simply, how be it vnfearefully and con∣stantly. For although their labour do commonly some vaine: Yet will God neuer suffer his word too bée so without fruite, but that some shall repent and turne too hym at the héering of it. Nay rather it commeth oftentimes to passe, that such as ere whyle were thoughte too bée nothing else but Satans instrumentes too assault the truthe, doo afterwarde at the héering of Christes worde, become stoute mainteyners, yea & preachers of ye same, according as it is shewed in this place. A. The worde sende is put héere for too stirre vp,The reproba∣tes cā neyther doo, saye, nor thinke any thing agaynst Gods chosen without gods leaue. as if it were said, behold I stirre vp certeine of Satans Synagog against thée, too the intent that thy fayth being tryed as it were by fyre, maye become more lyghtsome vntoo other Churches. After this manner dyd he in olde tyme stirre vp Pharao a∣gainste the people of Israell, Exodus. 9. d. 16. and Roma. 9. d. 17. And it is a greate comforte, that wée knowe for a
certeintie, howe our aduersaries are not able so muche as to thinke any thing against vs, except God himselfe stir them vp for the exercise and tryall of his Church. A. Wherevpon Paule wryteth too the Corinthians in this wise. There must néedes bée sectes among you, too the ende that suche as are tryed may bee made manifest among you. 1. Cor. 11. d. 19. Ve∣rely Satan and as many as fighte vnder his standarde, (as Tyrantes, Persecuters, Heretikes, Deceiuers, Hipocrites, and the rest of the enemies of the Churche,) practise vtterly too oppresse al the godly, and too quenche the light of the Gos∣pell.The benefite of persecution. But God according too his goodnesse & incredible wyse∣dome, taketh occasion of their naughtinesse, yea and of their wickednesse, to spred his owne glorie further abrode. For it commeth too passe, that the faith of the godly béeing tryed by aduersitie, becometh more apparant, and that the Hipocrites be discerned from the faithfull. VVhich say they bee Iewes and are not.The inuinci∣ble force of truthe. Loke before, 1. c. 9. Behold I will compell them too come. That is too say, it shall at length come to passe, that being in∣wardly conuicted and ashamed of themselues, they shal be in∣forced too acknowledge that thou standest in the truth. By meanes whereof many also shall leaue the vntruth, and im∣brace this doctrine, the rest striuing continually against thée, and yet hauing not what too alledge against thée. This thing doth the father promise vnto Christ, Psa. 72. b. 8.9. &. 110. a. 2. Also, Philip. 2. b. 10 and in other places it is written, Vnto mée shall all knées bow, Esai. 45. d. 23. &. Rom. 14. b. 11. So also Paule being erst a stout mainteyner of the Law, came hum∣bly too the feete of Ananias too take the Baptime of Christe, Acts. 9. c. 17. And the kéeper of the prison falling downe at the féete of Paul & Silas, sayd, my Maisters, what must I doo to be saued? Acts. 16. f 29.30. So the Galathians receiued Paule as an Angell of God. A. Galat. 4. b. 14. wherevnto perteineth also that which is written of the effectualnesse of Gods word, 1. Cor. 14. e. 24. & Hebr. 4. c. 12. And too knowe that I haue loued thee. S. q.d. Truely as for those that are ageinst thée, I wyll
driue manie of them too such a point that they shall acknow∣ledge thée too teach the truth, and shall set themselues downe at they féete to héere the doctrine of saluation, and so shall con∣fesse how much store I haue set by thée for standing stoutly in defence of my name. M. Wéee sée this thing too haue bin and dayly too bée fulfilled in especially in these our dayes, (if wée bée not wilfully blind) while many men resort with vs intoo the flocke of Christ, and professe the same doctrine which they sought by all meanes to oppresse as long as they liued vnder the kingdome of Antichrist. 10. Bycause thou hast kepte the vvorde of my pati∣ence, I also vvill keepe thee from the houre of tempta∣tion, vvhich shall come into the vvhole vvorld, to trie the dvvellers vpon earth. Bycause thou hast kepte. &c. G. That is too say,Patience. bycause thou hast bin patient in aduersitie after mine example. S. Or else the word of patience is the doctrine of the Crosse, accordyng as Paule termeth it, 1. Corin. 1. c. 18. And the wisedome of a Christian hart is this: namely to knowe that Iesus Christ, and that he was crucifyed for our sinnes. 1. Cor. 2. a. 2. He that beléeueth this word with a simple faith setting curiousnesse aside, shall stand safe frō all temptation of Heresies that shall come into the whole world for the tryall of the chosen, accor∣ding as Christ promiseth in this place. I also will keepe thee from the houre of temptation. A He sayth not,Temptation. and Tryall. I will keepe thée from being tempted: but I will kéepe thée from the houre of temptation. B. For it is no harme too bée tempted: but woe is them that are not kept or preserued in the houre of temptati∣on: for they faynte and slyde at euery little blast of Satans breth. Therfore the faithfull are kept frō the houre of temp∣tation, when they be not led away by the false errors and de∣ceites of Antichrist, but continue stedfastly in the faythe of Christ. VVhich shall come into the whole world. S. Truely this séemeth to perteine to the whole Churche in generall at the
last persecution of Antichrist, (according as it is set forth the sixth in order) at which time a great sorte of the Iewes, (af∣ter that the Church is purged from their Popishe superstiti∣ons and abhominations, and brought backe ageine to ye pure vnderstanding of the scriptures,) shall imbrace the faythe of Christ, according as Paule seemeth too say, Rom. 11. d. 31. Too trie the dwellers vpon earth. A. That is too say, that such as are tryed may bee manifest, M. so as the reprobates may bée dis∣cerned from the chosen. Looke the tenth verse of the seconde chapter heretofore. 11. Beholde, I come shortly: hold fast that vvhych thou haste, that no man maye take thy Crovvne [from thee.] Comforte of aduersities.Beholde, I come shortly. These bée wordes of comfort, that such as are troubled by Tyrantes, schismatikes, & Heretikes might in the meane while beare all aduersities stoutly: B as if it were said, be not discoraged, I will succor thee shortly, if thou confesse my name with a stedfaste and stoute mynde. C. Herevnto perteineth that which ye scripture speaketh euery where concerning the shortnesse of afflictions. Rom. 8. d. 18. & 2. Cor. 4. d. 17. &. Heb 11. g. 35. & A. Pet. 1. a. 6. &. 5. c. 10. Holde fast that which thou hast. A. Forsake not the faith which thou hast receiued, at the cōmaundement of the persecuter: or else, goe honestly through with the charge committed vnto thee, what∣soeuer aduersitie betide thée. That no man may take thy crowne from thee.None of the chosen can fall quite away. Bicause it is a very harde matter to holde out in temptation, we haue more than neede of continuall exhorta∣tion too perseuerance. M. For wée see dayly howe some waxe lazie, and some shrinke quite and cleane away from the pro∣fession of the Gospell, and some also beare most bitter hatred too the doctrine which they had professed, and persecute ye god∣ly as much as in them lyeth. Neuerthelesse the cace is in good plyght, in as muche as when one man happeneth too reiects Gods word, another receyueth it, and that which some men
do as it were trample vnder their féete too theyr owne losse, that doo othersome take vp and imbrace wyth reuerence and deuotion: accordyng as Christ sheweth, Math. 21. d. 43. and 22. &. 9.10. S. And Paule, Acts. 13. g. 46.48. and Rom. 11. b. 11.12. So was Matthie put in the roome of Iudas. Acts. 1. d. 26. Therefore let no man gather vpon these and such like places of Scripture, that Gods predestination can bée disappoynted or ouerturned by anye man: which must of necessitie bée infallible and vnchaungeable: accordyng too this saying A. All that euer my father gyueth mée, shall come vntoo mée, and hym that commeth vntoo mée I will not thrust out of the doore. Iohn. 6. d. 37. S and no man shall plucke them out of my hande, Iohn. 10. e. 28. and Roma. 8. g. 35. and 2. Timo. 4. b. 8. And whosoeuer they bee that fall awaye, they were neuer of the number of the predestinated and chosē sort, howbeit that they were for a time accounted too be of the chosen sorte, after the outward appeerance of the Church: according as Iohn writeth. They went out from among vs, but they were none of vs for had they bin of vs they had doubtlesse abiden with vs. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 19. 12. He that ouercommeth, I vvill make him a piller in the Temple of my God: and he shall not go out any more, and I vvyll vvrite vpon him the name of my God, and the name of the Citie of my God, the nevve Ierusalem vvhiche commeth dovvne out of heauen from my God, and mine ovvne nevv name. He that ouercommeth, I will make him. &c. A Agein he exhor∣teth to constancie, by promising a large & excellent rewarde.Pillers of Gods church. S. It behoueth Pillers not only to be strong of thēselues, but also too beare vp the whole weight of the building: So also are those too be accounted as pillers in the Church, which not only deale constantly in aduersitie in respecte of themselues, without giuing waye at all too the enemyes of the truthe:
but also strengthen others that are readie to quaile, by put∣ting them in minde of Gods promises, for the greatnesse of their reward, of the shortnesse of their afflictions, and of such other things: like as our sauiour Christ doth, Math. 10. c. 22.32. & Iohn. 15. d. 21. &. 16. d. 33. and as Paule doth, Rom. 8. d. 18. & Ephe. 3. c. 13. and 2. Thess. 1. c. 7. and as the author of the Epi∣stle too the Hebrues dothe, 10. g. 34. and 11. g. 35. and 12. c. 11.12. G. Then let the pastors and ministers take héede, that they be not a stumbling blocke too any man, seyng that they must bée as it were pillers not onely too beare out the assaultes of their enemies, but also too strengthen the faint hearted and weakelings in the faith. In the Temple of my God. That is to say in the Churche, whereof Salomons temple was a fi∣gure. G. In likewise, Paul termeth the Church of the lyuing God, Gods house. 1. Tim. 3. d. 15. A. And Christ calleth him his God, in respect of his owne manhood which he had taken vp∣on him, as it is to be séene in Iohn. 20. d. 17. and afore, 1. chapt. b.None of the chozen fall quyte away. 6. And he shall not go out any more. G. That is to say, he shall be mine for euer, and he shall be safe vnder my protection, so as he shall neuer miscarie. For although the faithfull séeme now and then too retire from God, by reason of the daungers and sundry terrors of the worlde that hang ouer them: yet doth the Lorde neuer cast them awaye, but kéepeth them by∣cause they bée committed too his charge, and gathereth them togither againe into his flocke, that they may not lye open to the crueltie and craftinesse of their enemies. For whosoeuer be endued with the spirite of regeneration and sanctification, they neuer fall so quite away, but that at length they ryse a∣geine and are saued. And I will wryte vpon him the name of my God.Gods fauour. That is too say, he shal alwayes bée sure of Gods fauor, and he shall liue in safetie vnder the defence and protection of God, he shall hang altogither vpon Gods prouidence, and he shall easely ouercome all his enemies through the assistance of heauenly strength.Citizens of Gods Citie. And the name of the Citie of my God. q.d. He shall bée a Citizen of the Citie of God, according as Paule
writeth to the Ephesians: nowe are yée no straungers and soiourners, but felowcitizens of the Sainctes, and Gods hous∣holde meynie. Eph. 2. d. 19. The happie and blessed felowship of the godly is likened too a Citie: first bicause all things are doone there decently, honestly, and in excellent good order: and secondly bicause the mutuall communion of Saincts is kept, and brotherly loue is maynteyned there among them. The new Ierusalem.Ierusalem. Forasmuche as this Citie was in time past counted holy: it dothe well shadowe Christes Churche which he him selfe hath made holy. Eph. 5. f. 26. Whiche thing wée shall sée more at large hereafter. 21. a. 2. VVhich commeth down out of heauen from my God. A. These things séeme too haue an eye to the eternall election, according whervnto the chosen are sayde too haue béene euermore with God. For he chose vs in Christ before the making of the world. Eph. 1. a. 4. M. And Christ sayth, They were thyne, and thou hast giuen them too mée. &c. Iohn. 17. a. 6. And mine owne newe name, A. verily wyll I write vpon him.Christes new name. Bicause Christ is God manifested in the fleshe, he hathe chalenged too him selfe a certayne newe name, in asmuche as he sheweth him selfe to bée the true me∣diator betwéene God and man, like as when he auouched him selfe to bee the bread of lyfe, the light of the worlde, the féeder of shéepe, the way, the resurrection, and the life:Electiō is the cause of fayth. which thing to beléeue, is not giuen too any, but too suche as were foreor∣deyned to saluation from euerlasting: according as he sayde to the vnbeléeuing Iewes, He that is of God heareth the word of God: the cause why you heare not, is for that yée bée not of God: Iohn. 8. f. 47. And agayne, But you beléeue not, bicause yée be not of my shéepe. My shéepe heare my voyce, and I knowe them, and they followe me. Iohn. 10. e. 26.27. And in these words Christ teacheth that which is sayd by Iohn, That which wée haue séene and heard, that doo wée declare vnto you, that you also may haue felowship with vs, and that our felowship may be with the father, and with his sonne Iesu Christ. 1. Iohn 1. b. 3. S. Notwithstanding there séemeth in this
place to bée an allusion too the maners of men, among whom it was grown into custome, that the valiant Princes which had deliuered their countrey from any sore daunger shoulde haue pillers, houge images, and arches of triumph ingrauen with their noble deedes, set vp vnto them by publike decrée in the open marketsteedes, to the intent too incourage others to doo the like déedes. 13. He that hath an eare, let him heare vvhat the spi∣rite sayth to the Churches. The reuerēce and credite that is to be giuen to Gods worde.He that hath an eare. &c. S. Euen by the often repetition of this parcell, we bee put in minde of this thing also which the Prophetes so oftentimes rehearse, namely, Thus sayth the Lord: least we should take Gods word stouthfully or slightly, as though they were but mans deuises. For Satā séeketh no∣thing more, than to bring Gods word out of credite, as it ap∣peareth by the story of the serpēt, Ge. 3. a. 1.2.3.4. Which thing is almost wrought in vs about the authoritie of this booke. And that is the cause why the holy Ghost repeateth so often,Who they bee that loue Christ and his lawe. that these are not words of mans deuise. M. And by this warnyng giuen to the Citie of Philadelphia (which word signifieth bro∣therly loue, or sauing an inheritance) it is manifestly picked out, who they be that be in loue with the euangelicall lawe of their brother Christ, and who they be that make sute for the sauing of the heritage of the Church (which is the number of those that are to be saued) by feyghting agaynst Antichrist. Namely those that lyue according to the Gospell, caring for none earthly things more than meate and drinke and appa∣rell: whiche for any temporall punishment cease not to im∣pugne the horrible abuses of the Popishe Cleargie: whiche discouer and warne men of the mysteries of Antichrist: which yéelde not vnto temptations, but withstande them: whiche holde fast true patience, notwithstanding their dayly persecu∣tion: which in feighting agaynst Antichrist continue to the ende: which encourage other men to attempt the like thing
agaynst Antichrist: and which are of so singular cōuersation, that after a sort they may be termed Gods. 14. And to the Angell of the Church of Laodicea, vvrite: Thus sayth Amen, the faythfull and soothfast vvitnesse, the beginning of GodsWorkmanship. creatures. And to the Angell. &c. A.Bishops of Laodicea. Of Laodicea wée haue spoken be∣fore. 1. c. 11. S. Of this Citie, Melito the Pastor of the Church that was at Sardis maketh mention in his booke of the Passeouer, with these words: Vnder Sergius the Vicepre∣sident of Asia (sayth he) at what time Sagaris was crowned with Martyrdome, there arose a great strife at Laodicea a∣bout the kéeping of the Easter. &c. Read Eusebius in the .xxvj. chapter of his .iiij. booke of Churchmatters. And concerning Socrates, Eusebius, Anatolius, Stephanus, and Theodorus Bishops of the same Churche, looke the same Eusebius in the xxviij. and .xxix. Chapters of his seuenth booke of Churche-matters. Thus sayth Amen, the faythfull and soothfast witnesse.Christ only is faythfull and soothfast. This is another description of Christ, whereby is expoun∣ded the Hebrewe worde Amen, which implyeth as muche as truenesse and faythfulnesse, A. as hath béene sayd oftentymes alreadie: and by exchaunge of name, it agréeth vnto Christe, or rather the termes of soothfast and faythfull are the peculiar style of Christ. For he in very déede proueth and witnesseth the father to be a kéeper of his promise, in asmuch as he (who had bin promised) was come to performe his charge. A. Con∣cerning whiche matter sée Rom. 15. b. 8. &. 2. Cor. 1. d. 20. Also looke the .7. verse of the first chapter héertofore. S. Besides this, he is also the beholder, witnesse & iudge of our harts, yea & of our whole life. A. In respect wherof he said a little before: And al Churches shal know how I am he that sercheth mens ray∣nes and hearts. 2. f. 23. Therfore not he that prayseth himselfe,Why Christ is called the beginning of Gods crea∣tures. but he whome God prayseth, is allowed. 2. Cor. 10. d. 18. The beginning of Gods creatures. S. G. Christ is called so, partly bi∣cause he is ye word & almightie power of god, wherby al things
were made. Prouerb. 8. a. 22. &c. Iohn. 1. a. 3. And also in respect of his manhood which he tooke vpon him, he is called the first begotten of all creatures, & Coloss. 1. b. 15. in whom all things are renued and restored to their former state. Roman. 8. f. 21. Ephe. 1. b. 10. G. And he is adorned with these titles of com∣mendation in this place, to the intente that the fayth of the godly may bée chéered vp, so as they may not doubte at all of his truenesse, but flée vnto him alone in their aduersities, as∣suring themselues that they shall not séeke his helpe in vayne. Nothing at all then dothe this title maynteyne the Arrians, who denie Christes Godhead. 15. I knovv thy vvorks: namely that thou arte ney∣ther hote nor colde. I vvould thou vvert eyther colde or hote. Imbracing of mens owne deseruings.I know thy works. A. Agayne he auoucheth that he knoweth well what the works of men bée. Thus dothe Gods spirite disgrace mens priuie thoughts and intents, and cast them in the téeth with them, to the ende they should make small ac∣compt of them selues. Thou hast an example héereof in Da∣uid, whom Nathan chargeth openly with his sinne that was secret. 2. Sam. 12. b. 7.8.9. A. Then let vs learne to walke ear∣nestly in the feare of the Lorde, séeing wée haue Christe the head of the Churche euery where present as a witnesse and iudge of all things that we doo, yea and thinke, Namely that thou art neyther colde nor hote. G. That is too say, thou hast no force at all in thée.Lukewarme Protestants. For he findeth faulte with the Laodiceans for dooing all things fayntly and sackly, and bicause they pro∣céeded not lustily in the way of the Lorde. For eyther they séemed too wise in their owne conceyte, and helde scorne too be taught or counselled at other mens hands, as it commonly commeth to passe: or else they were so fearefull and hartlesse, that they durst not set them selues agaynst manifest errours, for feare of afterclaps: according as Paule also vpbraydeth certayne men. Galath. 6. c. 13. A. And truly ouerfearfulnesse is
a token of distrust. For he that beléeueth Gods promises,Fearefulne and dastardie in Christians. shall easily despise all the manaces of men, bicause he is sure that God is higher and stronger than the whole world. In respect wherof the Apostle writeth thus of Moses: Through fayth he forsooke Egypt, and was not afrayd of the kings rage: for he endured in like cace as if he had séene him that is inuisible. Hebr. 11. e. 27. And where as dastardie or slouthfulnesse is shamefull in all men: truely it is sinfull and moste worthy of blame in Pastors, according as hathe beene shewed in Matthew. 10. b. 16. I would thou wert eyther colde or hote. •.Doublefaced Protestants. In some mens opinion, to bée colde is as muche as to bée vtterly voyde of fayth: and to be hote is to persist stedfastly and stout∣ly in fayth that is workfull by loue: and to be lukewarme, is nothing else but to be a counterfeter and dissembler, that is to say, to be hote and faythfull to outwarde appearance, and in∣wardly to be voyde of fayth. Furthermore it is an easier mat∣ter to bring a man to a sound minde which is an vtter infidel, than suche a one as will néedes be counted a beléeuer, and yet is nothing else but a dissembler and an hypocrite. Of which sort a man may sée many in these dayes, whiche go about to maynteyne their errors vnder pretence of fayth & godlinesse. And therfore byandby there is added. 16. Seeing then that thou art but lukevvarme, and neither colde nor hote, it vvill come to passe that I shall spevv thee out of my mouth. Seeing then that thou art but lukewarme. &c. S.Christians in title and not in liuing. He alludeth to the nature of lukewarme water, which commonly is wont to prouoke him that drinketh it, vnto spewing and vomiting. M. Therefore like as the drinking of warme water prouo∣keth a fasting stomake vnto vomiting: euen so the men that be Christians in profession, and yet performe nothing pertey∣ning to their profession, do after a sort prouoke God to thrust them out of the body of his Church. S. And let all them looke to be so serued which are Christians but in title only, and pro∣fesse
themselues to knowe God, but denye him in their dée∣d Tit. 1. d. 16. A. Whiche loue their brethren from the téethe outward, but not in déede and in truthe. 1. Iohn. 3. c. 18. Which saye vnto Christ. Lorde Lorde, and yet doo not that whiche hée commaundeth them. Math. 7. c. 21. And, Luke. 6. g. 46. S. This thing hath Christ shewed in another similitude saying: no man that putteth his hand to the plowgh and looketh backe, is meéete for the kingdome of heauen. Luke. 9. g. 62. And Pe∣ter: it wéere better for them not to haue knowen the way of truthe &c. 2. Petr. 2. d. 21. But contrariwyse Paule speaking of himselfe sayeth: forgetting the thinges that are behind me, and making still towarde the thinges that are afore mée, &c. Phil. 3. c. 13. A. And in another place hee exhorteth the faithfull, that they should not bee slouthful in indeuer, but feruent min∣ded, Rom. 12. b. 11. 17. For thou sayst, I am riche, and increased in goo∣des, and I vvant nothing. And thou knovvest not hovv thou art vvretched and miserable, and poore, & blynd, and naked. For thou sayest I am riche. &c. S. Such as forslow the occu∣pying of the goodes committed vnto them, by reason of the dulnesse and vaine restynesse of the fleshe, are reiected as vn∣profitable seruants and made poore, like as Christe sheweth in the Parable of the Talents. Math. 25. c. 26. And I wante nothing.The selfe soo∣thing or selfe flatterie of the Hypocrites. G. It is the propretie of hypocrites to beaste of theyr owne riches, that is to saye, of their owne merites and sa∣tisfactions, and too set lyght by the grace and mercie of God, and to make Chryste of no valewe to themselues. For they thinke themselues too bée holy, wyse, learned, and rightuous, and they trust too their owne woorkes, wheras notwithstan∣ding their holinesse is starke abhomination before God. Of these kyndes of men Christe speaketh thus: They that bée whole, haue not néede of a Physitian, but they that be sicke, Math. 9. b. 12. And again, you be they that iustifie your selues
before men, but God knoweth your heartes. Luke. 16. d. 15. And thou knowest not how thou arte wretched.A steeple con∣science. Lyke as there is no disease more daungerous or more deadly in a mannes bodie, than that whiche is so hidden inwardly as the cause and woorking thereof is vtterly vnknowne: euen so can nothing happen woorser vnto man, than to haue a sléepye conscience, and too bée touched with no féelyng of sinne: but too laye asyde all feare of Gods iudgemente, and to sooth him selfe, as though he were in a league with death and Hell, as the Prophet sayeth, Esai. 28. d. 15. And therefore suche a one is worthily sayd héere to bée wretched: for hée is far off from the true blissednesse. And miserable. A. that is too say,Or ruefull. worthie too bée pitied of others, S. bycause others ought too haue com∣passion of him béeing so miserable. For suche is the mylde∣nesse of Gods children, and so incredible is theyr charitie, that they pitie euen the wicked. Like as Samuell bewayled Saule, who notwithstanding was iustly reiected of God. 1. Sam. 16. a. 1. So also reade wée of Moyses and Paule, Exo∣dus. 32. g. 32. and Rom. 9. a. 3. and 2. Cor. 12. g. 21. And poore,Poore & blind. that is too saye, voyde of Gods spirite. And blynde, that is too saye, one whom Chryste enlighteneth not, whiche knoweth not God, nor Iesus Christ, whom he hath sent. Concerning blindnesse sée Iohn. 9. g. 41. And also the .xxiij. verse of the xxj. Chapter hereafter. M. Also he is called blynd, which séeth not how miserable and néedy himselfe is. And naked. B.Naked. That is to saye, voyd of faith that worketh by loue. These are the tytles of a lukewarme persone. Paule vpbrayding the Co∣rinthians with the same thyng, vseth a figuratiue spéeche, saying: Nowe yée bée full, nowe yée bée riche, yée reygne without vs. 1. Cor. 4. b. 8. for he meaneth that they reigne on∣ly in their opinion, and not in verie déede: and so standeth the case with the Laodiceans.
18. I councell thee to buy golde of meeOr tryed in the fyre. fyred out of the fyre, that thou mayst become riche: and vvhite rayment that thou mayst be clothed, and the shame of thy nakednesse may not appeare: and anoynte thyne eyes vvith eyesalue that thou mayst see. Why God re∣quireth dili∣gence in good works.I counsell thee to buy. &c. Great is the gentlenesse of Gods spirite, wherethrough he is wont to counsell men in their ad∣uersities without striuing. By the worde buy, hée shéeweth howe liuely and workfull fayth, is required at our hands. Not that we be able to deserue Gods fauour, or to purchase his benefites by our owne pollicie or power: but bicause God will not that any dulnesse or drouzinesse shoulde remayne in his seruaunts. By the way wée must beare in minde, that nothing happeneth vnto vs but by the frée fauour of God. Whervpon when the Lord by his Prophet willed all such as were a thyrst to come vnto him:Of buying without pay∣ing. he vsed likewise the worde buy, saying: Come, buy yée, and eate yée: and immediatly he added, come I say, and buy wine and milke without money, and without paying any thing for it. Esay. 55. a. 1. Then if any man say, what manner of buying can there be where there is no paying? We answere, that buying is vproperly called héere the manner whereby wée compasse any thing: and that the price is put for the labour, policie, or any other waye whereby wée attayne too it. Fyred out of the fyre, that thou mayest become ryche. A. Hée sheweth in what wyse wée maye growe riche too Godwarde. And hée vseth an en∣largement, as he did in the last verse before, matching golde agaynst pouertie.Rayment and eyesalue. VVhyte rayment agaynst nakednesse, and Eyesalue agaynst blyndnesse: by all whiche thinges there is nothing else ment, but the pure feeling of fayth: and the true vnderstanding of the Scriptures, that is to wit, concer∣ning God, and also concerning his Christ, and concerning as well his kingdome, as the true worshipping of him in spirite, that the same fayth beeing tryed as it were by fyre, maye
bée able to stande stedfast in temptation: according too thys saying, The wordes of the Lord are pure, tryed in the fire. &c. Psalm. 12. b. 6. also accordyng too this: fire shall trye euerye mans woorke what it is. 1. Cor. 3. c. 13.The mala∣pertnesse of Hypocrites. Also concerning the rai∣ment, the same thyng appeareth by hym that was thrust out from the mariage, bycause he had not on hys weddyng gar∣ment, that is too saye, that whereas he beléeued not from his hart, yet he durst put hymselfe intoo the companie of the beléeuers, Math. 22. a. 11.12.13. Such men were Iudas, Mat. 10. a. 4 and Iohn. 6. g. 70. and 13. a. 2. Ananias, Acts. 5. a. 1.2. and Simon Magus, Acts. 8. b. 9. furthermore it is manifest also, that in the Scriptures blyndnesse is matched as a contrarye againste faythe, as in Esai. 6. d. 10. and Iohn. 9. g. 41. So the proude Pharisies béeyng puffed vp wyth the knowledge of the lawe, and wyth ryghtuousnesse of woorkes, are reiected, and contrarywyse the fooles that distrusted bothe their owne knowledge and theyr owne deseruings, and trusted onely too the mercye of God through Iesus Christ, are inlyghtened: accordyng too thys saying. He that will bée wyse among you, let him become a foole, that he maye bée made wyse. 1. Cor. 3. d. 18. So lykewise at this daye our religious folkes, and the faction of the Anabaptistes, (who boast of the spirite in all things that they doe but dreame of, and which thrust in their owne workes) are like to the Laodiceans. 19. As many as I loue, I rebuke and chastise: be ze∣lous therfore and repent. As manie as I loue. &c. S. G.The chasti∣zing of the godly, and the punishing of the vngodly. It is a qualifying of the thyngs that went before. For in respect of those which eyther were not in faulte, or else were curable, he qualifyeth those things ageyne whiche he seemed too haue spoken somewhat rigo∣rously: least their heartes myghte haue fayled them, if they should haue thought themselues vtterly cast away. In suche wise it is sayd of Christ, he shall not breake a crazed réede,
neyther shall he quench smoking flaxe, Esay. 42. a. 3. &. Math. 12. b. 20. G. To chastize, is to correct one to his behoofe. And therefore héere is to be noted the difference betwéene the af∣flictions of the godly and the vngodly. For the godly are af∣flicted to their owne profyt: namely that they may be mur∣thered vnto patience: and hild fast in the feare of the Lorde: according as ye may sée in Iob. 5. c. 17. &. Ieremy. 31. c. 18. &. 46. g. 28. &. Prouerb. 3. b. 11. &. Hebr. 12. b. 6. But the correction of the vngodly is called a consuming of them. Ierem. 30. d. 23. 24.The contrarie effects of gods correction in the chosen and the reprobats. &. 46. c. 10. And therfore the chozen do amend at the Lords chastizement: as did Dauid, 2. Sam. 12. d. 13. but the reprobats are hardned the more by Gods squorges, as Pharao was. Exod. 9. b. 7. &. g. 35. Be zelous therefore and amend. He méeneth by these words, that there were in that Church some godly men whose earnestnesse and diligence ought to prouoke o∣thers vnto zelousnesse,Zelousnesse. so as they which woulde not do it, might be the lesse excusable. G. q.d. Be not luke warme anye more, but imploy thine indeuer diligently to aduance Gods glory: hate the thing that is euil, and do the thing that is good, without any feare of men. 20. Behold I stand at the dore, and knocke: if a man heare my voyce and open the gate, I vvill come in vnto him, and suppe vvith him, and he vvith me. Christes good¦nesse in preuē∣ting vs with mercy.Behold I stand at the dore. S. By these words he harteneth vs with boldnesse to aske the things that we haue néede of, in asmuch as he preuenteth vs of himselfe, and prouoketh vs fréely to aske: doing vs to vnderstande, that he himselfe is al∣togither more forward to pitie vs and to succoure vs, than we ourselues be to demaunde. G. q.d. Thou néedest not to séeke me in mountaines or vallies, or in any farre places: for I am at hand with thée to help thée. A. Likewise we reade in the Prophet: And it shall come to passe that I will answer them before they crye, and I will héere them whyle they be yet speaking, Esay. 65. d. 24. And knocke. G. By the name of doore,
he méeneth mans hart. That doth the Lorde knocke at by the preaching of his word, crying out and bearing witnesse of the force and effectualnesse of it to our spirit. And the same preaching is neuer frutelesse. For the godly receiue comforte by it, and the vngodly are condemned by it.We must her∣ken to Christ when he cal∣leth. If a man heare my voyce. A. It is the propertie of Christes shéepe to heare hys voyce and to follow him, Iohn. 10. e. 27. And open the gate. That is to say, willingly receiue the word that he hath heard, and beléeue in me, as they dyd of whome Luke speaketh, Act. 17. c. 11. I will come in vnto him and sup with him. He that receyueth Chryste by faythe is made all one wyth hym, and enioyeth the true rest and calmenesse of minde, whyche thing he meant to signifye in this place by the tearme of supper. 21. He that ouercommeth, I vvill graunte him to sit vvith me in my throne: in likevvise as I also haue ouer∣come and am set vvith my father in hys throne. He that ouercommeth. A.Perseuerance and cōstancie, In all these Epistles which Iohn is willed to send to the Churches, there is put an incourage∣ment to perseuerance and constancie, to the ende we mighte knowe, that Christes Church is exercised with continuall encounters. Wherefore we had néede to watch and to be so∣ber, least we be oppressed vnwares by Satan that olde eni∣mie of the truth, who worketh so effectually in his stubborn-harted children, that many are deceyued by theyr wylinesse and naughtinesse. I wyll graunt him to sit with me in my throne.Too sit with Christ. S. G. To sit with Chryste is to be copartner of his kingdome. M. This hath he promised in other places to those that be hys, Mat. 19. d. 28. & Luk. 22. c. 30. In likewise also as I haue ouercome. A. Victory ouer our enimies, that is to wit ouer sin, death,Christs victo∣rie is common to al the faith∣full. Sa∣tan & hell, is attributed properly vnto Christ. Neuerthelesse for asmuch as he is ye head of all the godly, ye frute of his victo∣ry redoūdeth vnto them: & for asmuch as they fight vnder hys
antesigne, they also are saide too ouercome, and their faith is said too be the thing that ouercōmeth the world. 1. Iohn. 5. a. 4. For thus speaketh Christ: In the world yée shall haue trou∣ble, but bee of good chéere, I haue ouercome the world. Ioh. 16. d. 33. By the way wée bée warned, that we must firste fight as Christ did, before we can reigne with him. For like as it be∣houed Christ too suffer first, and then too enter intoo his glorie (Luke. 24. d. 26.) so must we enter into the kingdome of God by manye tribulations: Acts. 14. d. 22. and Rom. 8. d. 17. and 2. Tim. 2. b. 11.12. and Iacob. 1. b. 12. 22. He that hath an eare let him heere, vvhat the spi∣rit sayth to the Churches. Looke before. 2. b. 7. The fourth Chapter. AFter this I looked, and behold, a dore vvas open in Heauen, and the first voyce vvhich I herd, vvas as it vvere of a Trumpet talking vvith mee, vvhich sayde: come vp hither, and I vvyll shevve thee the things that must bee fulfilled hereafter. The effect of this chapter.AFter this I loked. A. In this Chapter is described the worthinesse and excellencie of the sonne of God, vnto whō al the heauenly spirits & faith∣ful men yéeld testimonie with praise & thanks∣giuing, plainly acknowledging themselues to haue nothing but of his mere goodnesse & goodwill, wherby al∣so all things were made,The opening of Gods mi∣steries. And behold, a dore was open. G. Foras∣much as in this Reuelation there bée many things yt far sur∣mount all capacitie of man: Iohn sayth he saw a doore open in Heauen: by which maner of spéeche, the holy Scripture is wonte too betoken a more lyghtsome knowledge of Gods Mysteries or secretes: according as hath bin said, Mat. 3. d. 16. And the first voyce that I herde. In saying the firste voyce that
he herd, he gyueth vs to vnderstand that he heard many voy∣ces. VVas as it were of a trumpet.The voyce of a minister. The voyce of a minister of Gods word must be like a Trumpet: that is to wit, stoute, manly, not fearefull, not flattering like a slaue, nor concea∣ling the truth like a traytor. A. Concerning which matter see 2. Cor. 4. a. 1.2. &. 1. Thessa. 2. a. 3.4.5.6.7.8.Mans reason. Also looke the fifthe verse of the first chapter heretofore. Come vp hither. G. q.d. Lay away mans reason, that thou mayst be able to vnderstande Gods secrets. And I will shew thee.The dignitie of this pro∣phecie. Againe we sée how it was not man but God that was the author of this prophecie, to the intent we shuld not receiue it as a thing procéeding from men, but as a thing that came from God, who can neyther lye nor deceiue. Paule also to mainteine the certeintie of hys owne calling and doctrine against the false Apostles, doth af∣ter the same manner oftentimes auouche, that he was called to the charge of Apostleship, not by men, but by God: Gala. 1. a. 1. &. 2. a. 5. &. Ephes. 1. a. 1. So also Esay to assure the truth of his prophecie sayth, he saw the Lord sitting in maiestie and glory. Esay. 6. a. 1. 2. And immediatly I vvas in the spirit: and beholde, a throne vvas set in heauen, and one sitting vppon the throne. And immediatly I was. A.Christes Iu∣diciall autho∣ritie. What is meant by being in the spirit, it is said afore. 1. c. 10. And behold, a Throne. The throne or seate betokeneth the authoritie of the Iudge Christ, whose glory the vnrighteous shall not be able to endure. He is ap∣pointed of God to be the iudge of all men: and therefore hys throne is exalted aboue all the heauens, yea and aboue all creatures. And one sitting vpon the Throne. G. S.Christes king¦dome. By this maner of spéech héere is betokened the stablenesse of Christs king∣dome, like as also in another place wher it is said, Thy king∣dome is a kingdome of all worlds. Dan. 7. g. 27. G. Yet must we not conceyue any fleshly opinion concerning the king∣dome of Christ, as though he sate in some chaire of estate af∣ter
the maner of Kings. For suche descriptions tende to none other purpose, than to make vs vnderstande, that the things which the Prophets and holy mē of God haue conueyed vnto vs, were not emptie dreames, but a heauenly and diuine re∣uelation applied to their age and nature.Gods disco∣uering of his presence by sundry ways. For God discouereth his presence vnto men, sometime one way, and sometime an∣other, according as it lyketh him selfe best. So was he séene of Moses after one sorte, of Abraham after another sorte, of Esay after another sorte, and of Daniell after another sorte: In likewise, the holy Ghost appeared vnto Iohn Baptist in the likenesse of a Doue, Iohn. 1. e. 33. and afterward sate vpon the Apostles in fyrie tungs. Act. 2. a. 3. 3. And he that sate, vvas too looke vpon like vnto a Iasper stone, and a Sardine stone. And there vvas a raynbovve about the Throne like to the sighte of an Emeravvde. And he that sate. S. Christes Iudicial power which the father hath bestowed vpon him, & wherby he defendeth his Church from the aduersarie power, is royally described by Iohn, and yet but in such words as mans weaknesse is able to vtter so great matters withall.Christes Ma∣iestie and pui∣sance. Like vnto a Iasper stone, and a Sardine stone. S. G. This signifieth nothing else but that there was a certayne heauenly and godly brightnesse in the Iudge Christ, representing both a maiestie & a puissance terrible & vtterly inuincible to al men. For kings Thrones are wont to be gar∣nished with a certayne wonderous decking, to the intente the kings themselues may be both the more reuerenced and the more dreaded of all men. In which respect it séemeth that God appeared vnder the shape of such figure vnto his seruant Mo∣ses, and the thréescore and ten Elders. Exo. 24. d. 15.16. and af∣terward agayn vnto the Prophet Esay & Ezechiel. Esa. 6. a. 1. & Ezech.The Iasper stone. The Sardine stone. 1. b. 4. P. Moreouer men say, that the Iasper stone re∣sembleth the likenesse of water, & the Sardine stone the like∣nesse of fyre: wherby we may vnderstande, that the Lorde is
wont to execute his iudgements in fyre and water, according as we we reade in Gen. 7. b. 11. &. 19. e. 24. &. Exod. 14 f. 27. and 4. Kings. 1. b. 10. &. 2. Peter. 3. c. 12. &. 2. Thes. 1. c. 8. And there was a raynbow about the Throne. B.The rainbow. The Raynbowe is a token of Gods reconcilement through Christ: which thing the belée∣uers vnderstande well inough. Gen. 9. b. 13. Like to the sight of an S. Emerawd.An Emerawd Then say that an Emeraud is of such an orient grenenesse, that it maketh all things looke gréene whiche are layde by it. Euen so the world is renued and made fresh and flourishing agayne by Christ, and we become new creatures in him. A. Concerning which matter looke the .21. chapter and 19. verse hereafter. 4.The Church. And about the Throne vvere foure and tvventie seates: and vpon the seates I savv foure and tvventie El∣ders sitting, clothed in long vvhite robes: and they had crovvnes of golde vpon their heades. And about the Throne. G. Christ sitteth to iudge the earth,The faythfull are partners of Christes Iudicial law. & so do all the faythfull sit with him, iudging the whole worlde by the fayth which is in them: like as Noe is sayde to haue condēned the world by fayth. Heb. 11. b. 7. This copartnership of Iudiciall power with Christ, is promised to the faythful in Mat. 19. d. 28. &. 1. Cor. 6. a. 2. S. Iohn therfore alludeth to the cu∣stome of a wel ordered kingdome, where Kings and Princes when they intend to giue sentēce, specially in any case of great weight, doo it not without a great assembly of auncient perso∣nages that excell in experience of matters by practize, and in knowledge of good lawes, least they may séeme to condemne any man vpon their owne head.God is a most iust & vpright Iudge. In respect whereof (euen by this allusion also) he declareth God to be a moste iust Iudge, whose sentence (as of all sentences the rightfullest) all iust men must néedes allowe and commende. Wée reade of the lyke thing in Daniell. 7. f. 22. And by the foure and twentie Elders, heere are betokened bothe the Patriarkes and Pro∣phets of the olde Synagoge, & also the Apostles, Euangelists,
Pastors and teachers of the Church of the new Testamēt, togither with the godly kings and Iudges both of Iewes and Gentiles. For these are reckened by the name of Elders, as well in the old law as in the new. Exod. 24. a. 1. & Num. 11. d. 24. & Act. 20. d. 17. &. 1. Pet. 5. a. 1. &. 1. Thess. 5. c. 12. and oftētimes elsewhere in the writings of the Apostles. Clothed in long white robes.Purenesse nd vncorruptnes of minde. S. By these robes is betokened purenesse and vn∣corruptnesse of mind, that they should iudge all thinges vp∣rightly and not affectionatly, Exod. 18. c. 21. And they had Crownes of gold vpon their heads By the Crownes of gold is betokened the most pure méening of faith,Soundnesse of iudgement. wherethrough they iudge of all things according to the apointment of God, so as whatsoeuer they shall haue iudged vpon earth, may al∣so in likewise be ratifyed in heauen, according to this promis of Christs, whatsoeuer you bind vppon earth, shall also bée bound in heauen. &c. Math. 18. c. 18. Besides this, they may also signifie both the prerogatiue of Christes victories, and the copartnership of his kingdome, according to that whyche is said in Hebr. 11. f. 33. By fayth the Saincts haue subdued king∣domes. &c. 5. And out of the Throne proceeded lightnings, and thunderings, and voyces: and before the throne there vvere seuen lamps of fire burning, vvhich are the seuen spirits of God. The force and terriblenesse of Gods worde.And out of the Throne. G. Out of this Throne, that is to say out of this Church, procéedeth the power of Gods word or the force of the doctrine of the Gospell, whereby the enimies of the truth are put in feare, and the faithfull enlightned. For the holy Gohost, which dwelleth in the seruants of God, re∣proueth the worlde of sinne, of righteousnesse, and of iudge∣ment, Iohn. 16. a. 8. S. In respect whereof, their preaching is likened to thunderings, voyces, & lightnings. P. For in times past at the preaching of the Apostles, there went foorth won∣derfull thunderclaps and lightnings of manaces against the
vnbeléeuers. Act. 2. c. 19. &. 3. c. 14. &. 10. f. 39. &. 14. c. 15. &. 28. f. 26. And no lesse terrible is the iudgement which the Churche of Christ hath at this day. For when it is pronounced according to Gods appointment, it is ratifyed also euen in heauen. Whiche thing the Romish bishop chalengeth to himselfe without cause, verily bycause he knoweth not God.The Popes vsurpation. And truly it is a full wicked spéech, to say that his sentence is to be fea∣red though it be giuen wrongfully. When Christ sayth, Re∣ceiue ye the holy Ghost, whose sinnes soeuer ye release, they are released vnto them, and whose sinnes soeuer ye holde backe, they are hild backe. Iohn. 20. d. 23. he sheweth by whose guiding the Church cannot erre in giuing sentence. A. In con∣sideration whereof it is rightly sayd of Christ, Blissed shall you be when men hate you, and put you out of their compa∣ny, and rayle vppon you, and put out your name as an euill thing, for the sonne of mannes sake: Reioyce ye in that day and be glad. &c. Luke. 6. d. 22. S. And héere Iohn alludeth to the iudgements of God whiche he executed euen in olde time in Noes floud, in Sodome, in the red Sea, in Egypt, in the wil∣dernesse, against Sennacherib, and vtterly againste all re∣belles and vnbeléeuers. Of whiche terriblenesse yée maye reade in Exodus. 19. c. 18. and Psalme. 18. a. 8. and .29. a. 5. and 97. a. 3.4. and in other places.The light of Gods worde, and of his hea¦uenly giftes. And before the Throne there were seuen Lampes of fyre burning. &c. M. Héereby is meante the fulnesse and perfection of the heauenly graces and gyftes of the holy Ghoste, wherewith Christs kingdome is garni∣shed. G. For these are the faithfull enlightned, who else shoulde bée blynde and ignoraunt of Gods mysteries as well as all other men bee. For these thynges looke Romaines 12. b. 6.7.8. and .1. Corin. 12. a. 8.9.10. and Ephesians. 4. b. 11. A. And it is a greate comforte vntoo all the godly, that the Church is neuer so bereft of the lyghte of Gods worde, but that there bée alwayes some Lampes shyning in it, too the ende that suche as belong too the body of the Church may not be vtterly ouerwhelmed with the thicke darknesse
of this world. I graunt indéede, that very great store of Ty∣rants, persecutors, deceiuers, and heretikes imploy theyr force to the destroying of this light: but yet the spirit of ly∣ing which worketh in them, is not of so great strength, that he can quench the cleere light of Gods word: nay rather the truth alone dothe alwayes get the victory, whyle the au∣thors and followers of error do dayly perish and come to naughte. 6. And in the sight of the Throne there vvas as it vvere a Sea of glasse like vnto Christall: and in the mids of the throne and round about the throne vvere foure beasts full of eyes before and behind. The name of Sea.And in the sighte of the throne there was as it were a Sea of glasse. &c. G. S. The Hebrewes betoken all manner of gathe∣ring togither of waters by the name of Sea, according to this saying, and the gatherings togither of waters he called Seas. Gen. 1. b. 10. And the vessell wherein the préestes wa∣shed themselues when they went about their holy ministra∣tions, was called the brazen Sea. 3. Kings. 7. d. 23. In thys place the word Sea is taken for a company of much people, whome the spirit of God enlightneth.The likening of the Church vnto cleere glasse. And therefore they bée cléere as glasse like vnto Christall, that is to say, they be de∣liuered from darknesse, rustinesse and foule spottes, by Christ Iesus reigning in the Church. Also this similitude of the Sea may resemble baptim, which is called the Lauer of re∣generation or new birth. Tit. 3. b. 5. Looke the. 1. Corinthians 10.Baptisme. a. 1.2. Besides this, Like as glasse is cléere: euen so bap∣tim clenzeth mens harts by the working of the holy Ghost and maketh them cléere, yea euen in the outward conuersa∣tion and behauior: according as it is sayde, Let your light so shyne before men, as they may see your good works, &c. Math. 5. b. 16. M. S. G. Lastly, lyke as Christall is made of water, con∣gealed by long continuance of time: euen so the faith that is
vndertaken in baptim, is brought to perfection by long con∣tinuance of time, and many tribulations. G. Wherevnto per∣teyneth that singular exhortation of Paules which is writ∣ten. Ephesians. 4. c. 14. And whereas this sea is sayde to haue bin in the sight of the Throne: it signifyeth that the power of Christ is effectual in the ministration of baptim. A. For Christ hath not ordeyned that Sacrament in vayne: but he hath so linked the signe and the thing it selfe togither, as no man that beléeueth the promis which is wont to bée made there, can be without frute. For Christe is presente, who is euer∣more readie to play his part by the secret working of the ho∣ly Ghost, so that fayth be there, which alone maketh vs par∣takers of Gods grace and benefyts. And in the middes of the Throne and round about the Throne were foure beastes. G.The maiestie of Gods pre∣sence. Héer∣by we may gather that the beasts whych Iohn saw, had their backes vnder the Throne, and their faces as it were rounde about the throne. S. Moreouer the thrones of kings haue bin accustomed to be both vnderset and garnished with the ima∣ges of some kind of liuing creatures. 3. Kings. 10. c. 18.19.20. A. So also it is registred in histories, that diuers beasts were wont to be coupled to chariots of triumphe, and that conque∣rors were receyued into the Citie with such pomp. After the same manner the Scripture séemeth to attribute both chaire of estate and chariot of triumph, vnto God himselfe in the Psalme. 68. b. 18. Which place Paule alledgeth, speaking of the triumph of our Sauioure Chryst. Ephes. 4. b. 8. Further∣more, there is mention made of a like solemnitie in Salo∣mons Ballade in. 3. c. 9. Wherevppon,The Angels do seruice too the chozen sorte. those foure beastes are (not amisse) thought of some, too bée the heauenlye and seruisable spirites whych are sente foorth too the foure coastes of the Heauen, through whych the kyngdome (that is too say the Church) of Christ is dispersed, to execute the things that are determined to be done in mens affaires, by the vn∣serchable and euerlasting purpose of God: according to that which the Apostle writeth, that the Angelles are ministring
or seruisable spirites, sent foorth to do seruice for their sakes whiche shall receiue the heritage of saluation. Hebr. 1. d. 14. P. M. Neuerthelesse, there are that would haue ChristChrist. to be be∣tokened by these foure liuing wights. For (say they) he was borne of the virgin as a man, he suffered death as a calfe, ry∣sing agayne as a Lyon, and mounting vp as an Egle. M. The old doctors haue taken them for the foure Euangelistes,The foure E∣uangelists. and haue likened Mathew to a man, Marke to a Lyon, Luke to an Oxe, and Iohn to an Egle. But like as the first expositi∣on which we haue set downe of the heauenly spirites, is the simpler:The holy spi∣rites indued with know∣ledge, and re∣uelers of gods secretes vnto vs. so it fitteth the present text better. Full of eyes before and behind. He méeneth that those heauenly spirites are ende∣wed with knowledge both of thinges past and of thinges too come, as whereof they haue neede for the well ordering and administring of Christes kingdome: A. According as the holy Scripture declareth howe many thynges haue bin foreshe∣wed by them. 7. And the first beast vvas lyke a Lyon, and the se∣cond beast vvas lyke an Oxe, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast vvas lyke a flying Egle. And the first beast was lyke a Lyon. G. The same vision al∣most is reported by Ezechiell. 1. b. 5. & 10. b. 9. sauing that the same order is not obserued euery where: besides also that Iohn saw foure faces in foure beastes, whereas Ezechiell saw four faces in one beast, or foure beasts hauing foure fa∣ces a péece.Things need∣full in the exe∣cution of any charge. Lyke a Lyon. G. S. In a Lyon there is corageousnesse and strength, in an Oxe peinfulnesse and diligence, in a mās visage wisdome and right iudgemēt, in an Egle swiftnesse or easinesse in doing his seruice: which things they had néede of which will gouerne any kingdome well and happely. In this respect ye Lord is euery where said to sit vpō the Cherubins & to ride vpō them. Ps. 80. a. 1. & 99. a. 1. for yt by thē he executeth
his iudgements corageously, héedefully, vnwéeriably, wisely, and very swiftly. Such doth the prophet Ezechiell paint out the Cherubins holding vp and garnishing the throne of God the iudge, and drawing his chariot of triumph. Neither is it amisse for vs to take these foure beasts to be Cherubins, folo∣wing Ezechiel, who saith: And I vnderstood that they were Cherubins. Ezech. 10. d. 20. Also he maketh the foure beastes to be but all one, which one neuerthelesse hath all these foure faces or shapes, by reason of the foresayd operations, where∣with those seruisable spirits whose seruis Christ vseth in go∣uerning his kingdome, are indewed. 8. And the foure beasts had each of them sixe vvings a peece round about them, and they vvere full of eyes vvithin: and they had no rest day and night, saying: ho∣ly, holy, holy, Lord God almightie, which vvas, which is, and vvhich is to come. And the foure beastes. S.In what sort wee ought to searche and consider Gods Maiestie. In the same forme doth Esay also peint out the Seraphins, saying. A. And the Seraphins stoode ouer him: each of them had sixe wings apéece: with two of them they couered their face, with other two they couered their féete, and with the other two they flew. Esay. 6. a. 2. B. Which figure is not without a méening. For these wings disposed in that wise, conteyned some mysterie, whiche the Lord would not haue to be vtterly vnknowen. B. The paire of wings wherewith the Angells flewe, betoken nothing else but their quicknesse and prestnesse to execute Gods iudgements. The two wings wherewith they couered their faces, bewray right well, that not euen the Angelles are able to abide the brightnesse of God, and that they are so dazeled at the sight of God, as we be at the beholding of the sunne when he shyneth out. Now if the Angelles be not able to endure the maiestie of God: what a rashnesse is it of man, to go about to rush so far foorth? We may learne therefore, that we ought not to search for any more of God, than is méete and expedi∣ent:
yet did not the Angels so hyde their faces, but they had some sight of God: for they flew not at all aduentures. So also must wée looke vpon God, howbéeit no more than the a∣bilitie of our nature will beare. A. His maiestie shall be eui∣dent inough vnto vs, so long as we bée in this worlde, if we set it before vs to looke vpon in the glasse of the Gospell, ac∣cording as Paule full excellently teacheth. 2. Cor. 3. d. 18. The other payre of wings that were nethermost, had a contrarie vse to the vppermost. For lyke as with the vppermost win∣ges, they couered theyr faces, that they mighte not bée ouer∣whelmed, with the brightnesse of God: so also haue they their nether wings too hide themselues from the sight of vs. Nowe if the case stande so, that the small rayes of Gods brightnesse which shine foorth in the Angels, can not be séene of vs with∣out ouerwhelming vs out of hand: howe should wée behold that most bright and lightsome maiestie of his? Then let men learne, that they bée excéeding farre off from the perfect kno∣wyng of God, séeing they attaine not so muche as to the An∣gells. And they were full of eyes within. S. These eyes betoken their fulnesse of knowledge in dooing things,The fulnesse of knowledge in the Angels, and their pray¦sing of him without ceas∣sing. lyke as a little afore in the sixthe verse. And they haue no reste. B. Heere is an incklyng gyuen of theyr earnestnesse and diligence in magnifying and setting oute the goodnesse of God the cre∣atour. And therfore Iohn vseth a woorde of the tyme pre∣sente, saying they haue no reste. A. q.d. They neuer cease from setting foorthe the prayses of GOD. E. Esaye sayth they cryed out.God only is holy. Esaie. 6. a. 3. Holie, holie, holye. C. This stile agreeth aryghte, onely vntoo God. For hée onely is holye: and all other things are after a sorte vncleane in compary∣son of him, according as hathe bene sayde alreadie hereto∣fore. 3. b. 7. The olde fathers vsed thys Texte when they woulde proue the three persones in the one substance of the Godheade agaynste the Arrians. Whose opinion al∣thoughe it be not too bée myslyked: yet were it better too vse stronger textes againste heretikes. For they bée made
more stubborne, and they triumphe in themselues, when they bée pressed with textes that bée scarse euidente. For it had bin easye for them to haue answered, that the number of three betokeneth héere perfection, as it doth in other places of scripture. Therfore although wee doubt not but the Angels betoken God héere in thrée persones (as doubtlesse God can not bée praysed, but that the prayses of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoste muste néedes bee blazed al∣together:) yet notwithstandyng, it woulde behoue vs too vse more euident textes, least the heretikes laughe vs too scorne for oure laboure. Lorde God almightye. A. Looke a∣fore in. 1. b. 8. VVhiche was, whyche is, and whych is to come. C. The Iewes quarelling alwayes agaynst the truth, ima∣gine thys too bee spoken of the creation of the thrée partes of the worlde, that is too witte aboue Heauen, and vnder Heauen. But by these woordes is mente nothyng than the euer∣lasting and vnchangeable Godhead, accordyng as is sayde afore. 1. b. 8. C. Howebéeit when wee heare,The right ma¦ner of pray∣sing God. that the An∣gelles are occupyed in settyng foorthe Gods glorie: it be∣hooueth vs too followe theyr example. For too bée occu∣pyed in magnifying his name is the holyest of all serui∣ces that wée can doo vntoo him: A. According as it is sayde in the Psalme. 50. c. 14. and Hebrues. 13. c. 15. and. 1. Pe∣ter. 2. a. 5. G. And so muche the lyker shall wee bee vntoo the Angelles, whose example is héere sette foorthe for a patterne to vs. But the praysing of him must not be restrayned only to the tung: for it must be referred to all the dooings of oure lyfe, so as wée may haue an eye chiefly to the prayse and glo∣rie of the Lorde. 9. And vvhen those beastes gaue honour and glory and blissing vnto him that sat vpon the throne, vvhich liueth for euer and euer. And when those beastes. S. That is to saye,To glorifie God. when they ad∣uaunced
as well the power as the bounteous goodnesse of him alone with singular commendations: and magnifyed him alone as of all persons the noblest, with triumphāt talke and songs of reioycing. For to giue him glory, is to bestowe themselues and all that they haue vpon him, with singular reuerence and seruisablenesse.To honor God. And to giue him honor, is (whatsoeuer they be, or whatsoeuer they haue) to father the same vpon his only blissing, and to yéelde him thankes for it. And to giue blissing vnto God,To blisse God. is to aknowledge with thāks∣giuing, that we be that which we be, and that we haue that which we haue, by his good will. The blazing abroade of hys prayses, the worshipping and seruing of hym, and conse∣quently the acknowledging of his bounteous goodnesse togy∣ther with thanksgiuing, is very rife both in the psalmes and in the writings of the Apostles. Vnto him that sate vppon the throne. A. That is to wit, to God or to Christ: For the maiestie and puissance of eyther of them is all one, bycause there is but one God which liueth for euer and euer.In incorage∣ment to prayse God. A. So sayd he ere∣while: behold I am aliue for euer and euer, looke afore, 1. d. 18. S. G. And this is added for the comforte of the godly, bycause they shoulde not sticke to giue glory, honor and blissing vntoo God whyche liueth for euer and euer, euen mawger the worlde, although the world should threaten to kill them for their labor. For God who is their life continueth still alyue, and cannot be plucked from them, but will reuenge the shea∣ding of theyr bloud. A. And therefore Dauid saide, I wyll blisse the Lord at all tymes, his prayse shall euermore bée in my mouth, &c. Psalme. 34. a. 1. Also, Prayse thou the Lorde O my soule, I wyll prayse the Lord whyle I liue: I will sing vnto my God as long as I shall haue any béeing. Psalme. 146. a. 1. Therefore whatsoeuer thing breatheth, let it prayse the Lorde. Psalme. 150. a. 6.
10. The foure and tvventie elders fell dovvne before him that sate vpon the throne, and vvoorshipped him that liueth for euer and euer, and threvv dovvne theyr crovvnes before the throne, saying: The foure and twentie Elders fell downe. &c. A. What wée ought too vnderstande by these .xxiiij. elders, it hath ben sayd alreadie in the fourthe verse of this presente Chapter.Causes to moue vs to prayse God. And woorshipped him that. &c. For it is good reason that men vpon whom God hath so greatly voutchsafed his vnspekable good∣nesse aboue the Angels (as the Apostle sheweth plainly Heb. 2. d. 16.) should prayse him from the bottome of their hearte, and with feruent desyre, and yelde as greate thankes as they can deuyse, vntoo him whom those holie & heauenlye powers neuer cease to aduance with commendations, nor neuer are wearie of praysing him at all tymes: and that so much the rather, séeing that they aduaunce his goodnesse so mightyly, for his benefites bestowed not so much vppon themselues as vpon vs. Therfore séeing that the holie Angels beginne the quéere vnto vs: now let vs also answere them with godlie and continuall deuotion of our harts. Moreouer after the ex∣ample of the Elders (which fall downe before the face of him that sitteth, woorshipping him, casting down their crownes, and confessing his singular and inestimable goodnesse, name∣ly that they be that whiche they bee, not by their owne deser∣tes, but by the grace and mercie of God:) let vs fall downe before his face, let vs woorship him, and let vs caste downe ourThat is to say, notable and excellent gifts, benefits, or blessings. crownes, if we haue receiued any at his hand, acknow∣ledging the goodnesse of him only, and yelding him thankes, and from hencefoorth leading a lyfe that may beséeme such as be set frée from endlesse death. Rom. 6. a. 4. and Ephe. 4. f. 32. & Coloss. 3. a. 2.3. And threwe downe their CrownesCrownes. before the throne. That is to say (as we haue haue touched alredy) they reuerently yéeld vnto God alone, the victorie whereof, they themselues reape the frute: and they playnly confesse them∣selues

And, by the grace of God I am that I am. 1. Cor. 15. b. 10. And euery good gift (sayth sainct Iames) & eue∣ry perfect gifte is from aboue, and cōmeth from the father of light. &c. Iames. 1. c. 17. S. Now let the wicked flatterers of the Pope goe, and make Rome the throne, and woorship theyr God the Romish bishop that sitteth vpon the throne, O blas∣phemie, O wickednesse, which God shortly destroy. Amen. 11. Lord thou art vvorthie to receyue glorie, and ho∣nour, and povver, for thou haste created all things, and for thy vvill they bee, and are created. Lorde thou art worthie. E. Some Gréek copies haue héere a fewe mo wordes: namely, thou oure holie Lorde and God art woorthye too receyue,Glorifying of God. Glorie, and honoure, and power. S. In the nynth verse he had put Glorie, honour, and blissing: And héere in steade of blissing, hée hathe put power: verily bycause hee hathe subdewed the aduersarie powers, and re∣couered vs intoo the fréedome of the chyldren of God. A. For he is the kyng of glorie, the myghtie and strong Lorde, the Lord myghtie in battel. Psalm. 24. c. 8. who hath abolished euen death it selfe, and broughte lyfe and immortalitie a∣broade into the worlde, by the Gospell, 2. Tim. 1. c. 10. For thou haste created all things.The cause why God created all things. Wee see in this place, for what purpose God created all things: namely to the intente that vppon the creation of things, men shoulde take occasion to sette foorth his prayses: lyke as it is also too bée gathered by the Psalme.The Mani∣chees. 8. a. 3. and. 19. a. 2. Also this place makethe a∣gainst the two beginnings of the Manicheis. For héere God is expressely auouched too bée the only Creator of all thyn∣ges,Gods good will is the preseruation of all things. lyke as in Genesis. 1. a. 1. And for thy wyll they bee. Lyke as nothyng enforced God too create the worlde, but his owne infinite goodnesse: so also muste the preseruation
and good plyghte of all things bée fathered vppon the good∣nesse of him in likewyse, S. according to this saying of Pau∣les, who hath knowen the Lordes mynde, or who hath bin a counsell with him? or who hathe giuen firste too hym, and hée shall bée recompensed? For, of him, and by hym, and for him are all things. Rom. 11. d. 34.35.36. Therefore like as all thynges were created at the firste, vtterly withoute the aduice, helpe, or deserte of any wyght, by Gods owne onely good and frée will: euen so also are all thyngs repaired and restored to their former dignitie by the spirit of Christ.

ANd I savv in the ryght hand of him that sate vpon the throne, a boke vvritten vvithin and vvithout, sealed vvith seuen seales. ANd I sawe. &c. A. This chapter teacheth,Christe is the discouerer of the fathers will both to men and An∣gels. that it is the peculiar office of Christ, to open the wil of his father, which else should be hidden and vnknowne to men. S. Truely the miseries of Christes kingdome are described in the olde Testament, howbéeit so wrapped in sundry figures and sha∣dows (& that so darkly & riddlelyke) as the glorie of the Gos∣pel, & the renoume of Chrysts kingdom, was scarse through∣ly perceyued of the verye Angels, before the death of Christe as Paule witnesseth Eph. 3. b. 10. & 1. Peter. 1. c. 12. Of which mysteries of Chrystes kingdome there is somewhat writ∣ten in the Psalms. 2. b. 6. and 22. g. 28.29. &. 45. b. 8.9. &. 110. a. 2. &. 118 d. 25. & also in the prophets. Esa. 9. b. 6. &. 11. a. 3. &. 53. c. 8. & Dan. 7. d. 14. But at the cōming of Christ, these mysteries be∣gan to be made more open from time too tyme, whervpon he sayd too his disciples, Blissed are your eyes, for manye kings and Prophets would fayne haue séene the things that you sée now. &c. Mat. 13. b. 16. & Luke. 10. d. 23.24. Also Abraham your
father was desirous too sée my daye: he sawe it, and was glad of it. Iohn. 8. g. 56. Ageyn, he that is lesser in the king∣dome of heauen, is greater than Iohn Baptist. Math. 11. b. 11. Moreouer when the vayle of the temple was rent asunder at the death of Christe, then were the holie of al holies disco∣uered, that the thinges whiche were done within, myght ap∣peare to the sight of men. After he was risen again, then did hée open the vnderstanding of his disciples, that they myght perceyue the misteries of the scriptures, Luke. 14. g. 45. And when Christ was gone vp into heauen, and had sent downe the holie Ghoste too teache them all truthe, then vnderstoode they manie, both of his sayings and dooings, which they were ignorante of before, according as they themselues do diuers tymes confesse. Of these things Paule openeth some verye well in the. 2. Cor. 3. b. 6. & Gala. 4. c. 22. and in other places. And so doth the author of the Epistle too the Hebrues. 10. a. 1. In the ryght hand of him that sate vpon the throne.Where true knowledge is to be sought. Lyke as no man knoweth the things that belong to man, but the spirite of man, which is within him: euen so no man knoweth the things that are in God, saue the spirite of God. 1. Cor. 2. c. 11. Therfore the knowledge and vnderstanding of Gods myste∣ries, must be sought for at the right hande and power of god, who gouerneth al things according to his owne wonderfull wisedome, and not at the will and strength of our owne sel∣ues.Gods booke. A booke. No doubt but the booke betokeneth whatsoeuer God hath left in writing vntoo vs by the Prophets and Apo∣stles for the strengthening of oure saluation. Aske counsell (sayth the Prophet) out of the Lordes booke, and reade it. &c. Esai. 34.Things past, and things to come. d. 16. VVritten within and without. So reade wée of a scroll in Ezechiell, And it was written both on the foreside and on the backeside, Ezech. 2. d. 10. that is to saye, on bothe sydes as wel without as within. G. Which thyng some refer both too the things going afore, and to the things following after:Multitude of ons. and other some will haue these woords to betoken the great multitude of afflictions: as if it had bin sayde, there
were so many and so great troubles hanging ouer the world, that the booke was not able to holde thē within it.The multi∣tude of Gods mysteries. Othersome vnderstande therby as well the greatnesse as the great num∣bers of the mysteries of Christs kingdome, and they will that by this similitude, it should be sayd thus: For as much as we want paper of the one side to write the things that were to be written, wée write it also on the other side. Which selfesame thing Iohn hath vttered in a surmounting maner of spéeche concerning the notable sayings and dooings of Christ, saying that the world were not able to holde the bookes that were to be written of such maner of sayings and dooings, if all of them should be written. Iohn. 21. d. 25. Many holde opinion that by this figure is mente, that the Gospell lyeth hidden inclosed within the olde testament. A.A distingui∣shing of the outward letter of the scrip∣ture from the spirite or mea∣ning of the same. But moste rightly of all others do they séeme to déeme, which distinguish the outwarde letter in Gods worde, from the inwarde meaning which the only elect perceyue in the lawe of God. For it is certayne that the lawe of the Lorde is vnto some men but a dead letter, bicause they béeing voyde of Gods spirite, can not perceiue the myste∣ries that are hidden there. For God imprinteth his lawes in the only hearts of the elect, by the holy Ghost, like as he also enlightneth their minds: according as it is playnly set out in Ierem. 31. f. 33. and Hebr. 8. c. 8.9.10. and. 10. c. 16. Heerevpon commeth so often mention of the spirite and the letter in the scriptures, and specially in the Epistles of the Apostles, when mention is made of Gods lawe. Rom. 2. d. 29. and. 2. Cor. 3. b. 6. whervnto perteyneth that which is added immediatly.Of sealing, & of the number of seuen. Sealed with seuen seales. M. Many referre these seuen seales to the se∣uen chiefe mysteries of Christ, which are his Incarnation, his Passion, his Resurrection, his Ascention, his sending of the holy Ghost, his calling of the Gentiles, and his comming vnto Iudgement. Of al which things the whole summe is contey∣ned in the Articles of our beleefe. C. Howbeit for as muche as the number of seuen betokeneth perfection (as hath beene sayd héeretofore) they déeme more right, which expound it, that the
booke was fully and throughly shet, as if Iohn should say, this booke was shet and sealed treble and fourefolde. S. So read we in the Prophet treating of the blindnesse of the Iewes. The vision is become vnto you as the words of a booke that is sealed vp: which if they deliuer to one that can reade, and saye, I praye thée reade in it: then will he answere, I can not bicause it is faste sealed. And if the booke be deliuered to him that hath not learned to reade, and one say vnto him, I pray thée reade in it: then wil he answere, I know no letters. Esa.Mans wit is vtterly vnable to searche out Gods myste∣ries. 29.11.12. Also sée Ezechiel. 2.10. &. Dan. 12. c. 9.10. And what else is ment héereby, than that the whole summe of the miste∣ries conteyned in the scripture, can not be serched out by any wit of man, except Christ only (who hath the key of Dauid) do open the locke from time to time? A. For he onely is the tea∣cher and master of the Church, who is giuen vs of God to bée a witnesse and controller of our dooings. Esa. 55.4. in whome all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge are layde vp. Colos. 2. a. 3. Also this booke is sayde to bée sealed with seuen seales, to giue vs to vnderstande, howe it is not lawfull for vs too take any thing from it, or too put any thing too it, lyke as no man addeth or diminisheth any thing when let∣ters bée closed vp and sealed. Finally, nothing is conteyned there, which must not be fulfilled in hys due tyme. Math. 5. c. 18. and. 24. c. 35. 2. And I savve a strong Angell, crying vvith a loude voyce: VVho is vvorthy too open the booke, and too looze the seales of it. The zelous∣nesse of Chri∣stes ministers in seeking to haue his word published and knowen.And I sawe a strong Angell. &c. A. Forasmuche as the fore∣sayde written and sealed booke could stande in no stead, except the mysteries that were hidden in it were disclosed: nowe Iohn sheweth how & by whom it was opened, to the end that some knowledge and comforte might redounde thereby vnto men. In the meane season he bringeth in a strong Angell, demaunding wyth a loude voyce, who he was that were
worthy to open the closed booke, and to loozen the seales of it? This strong Angell crying with a loude voyce, betokeneth any faythfull minister of Christ, which béeing inflamed with inuincible constancie of mynde, and with great desirous∣nesse to aduaunce Gods glorie, and with earnestnesse to further the profite of his brethren, must by all meanes fore∣sée and séeke (yea and also endeuer) that this booke may bée opened: that hée maye minister true doctrine out of it too the people, according too the charge enioyned him of the Lorde. A. Wherevnto perteyneth this saying of S. Paule, I cease not to giue God thankes for you, making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of oure Lorde Iesus Chryst, the father of glorie, shoulde giue you the spirite of wisedome, and open vnto you the knowledge of him selfe, enlightning the eyes of oure myndes that you maye knowe what the hope is wherevnto he hath called you, and howe riche the glorie of his heritage is among the Saincts, & what is the exceeding greatnesse of his power to vswarde, &c. Ephe. 1. d. 16.17.18. For so bée the Seales of the booke ope∣ned vnto vs by little and little, when wée growe from day to day in the knowledge and fauour of God: according as wée bée wylled too doo by Peter. 2. Epistle. 3. d. 18. VVho is wor∣thy too open the booke. S. G. This demaunding by way of woondering, increaseth the hardnesse of the matter. And too looze the Seales of it. A. That is too saye, too open the meanyng of mysteries that lye hydde in it, and too expound them vnto others. 3. And no man, neyther in heauen, nor in earth, nor vnder the earth, vvas able to open that booke, nor too looke vpon it. And no man neyther in heauen. A.Onely Chryst can vtter the mysteries of God. So greate was the wor∣thinesse and prerogatiue of that thing, that it excelled all crea∣tures. S. Wherby it appereth also (according as we haue said a little afore) that ye foresaid superexcellēt brightnes of ye Gospel
was vnknowen euen to the very Angels, vntyll they had learned it of Christ, as Paul teacheth Eph. 3.10. &. 1. Pe. 1. c. 12. Nor in earth. A. If none were founde in heauen, able to open the booke, howe muche lesse in earth, which is wholly ouer∣whelmed with ignorāce? Nor vnder the earth. B. This is added to enlarge the matter: as if he should say, there was no crea∣ture found worthy of this honour. VVas able to opē that booke. That is to say, eyther to reade in it, or to expounde it vnto o∣thers.The vnability of man to find out Gods mi∣steries with∣out Gods spi∣rite. Nor to looke vpon it. q d. So farre is any man off from disclosing the mysteries of that booke vnto other men by his owne power, that no man in the worlde is able to looke vpon the booke. Which thing was after a sort betokened in the trās∣figuration of Christ, when his Disciples were so wonderfully stricken in a maze at his brightnesse, that they were not able to endure it. Math. 17. a. 6. G. Euen so all the wise men & Phi∣losophers of this world, which vpon trust of their owne sharp with haue attempted to know euen the heauenly things, were striken with greater blindnesse at the sight of this booke, bi∣cause they went about, both to comprehende, and also to teach other men the truthe, without the spirite of God. Héere vpon Paule most rightly sayth, when they thought them selues to be wise, they became fooles Rom. 1. c. 22. The Iewes also haue a vayle drawen before their eyes, that they can not take holde of the truthe whiche is conteyned in this booke. 2. Cor. 3. d. 14. The Hypocrites likewise take vpon them the abilitie to open this booke: howbeit in vayne: for they come so farre short of comprehending Gods mysteries, that they attayne not so muche as the certayne knowledge of them selues: A. As wée haue shewed afore. 3. a. 1. &. d. 17. 4. And I vvept sore, bycause no man vvas founde vvorthy to open and to reade the booke, nor to see it. The affection o godly mini∣ towards the Church.And I wept sore, bicause. &c. G. For as muche as in this sto∣rie there were many darksome and intangled things, whiche no man was able to vnfolde: Iohn was sory and wept: wi∣shing
that the Churche might knowe the mysteries whiche were hidden in the booke. S. For so are the godly wont to be∣wayle the common miserie of mankinde. So were Moses, Dauid, Esay, Ieremie, Daniell, yea and euen our Sauiour Iesus Christ wont to do. After whose example, the faythfull must also bewayle the blindnesse of men, and learne to know, that whatsoeuer the worlde wondereth at and commendeth, it is nothing else but vanitie, considering that the true and substantiall knowledge of things is hidden from it. Math. 11. d. 25. and. 1. Cor. 2. d. 14. 5. And one of the Elders sayd vnto mee: vveepe not: Beholde, a Lyon of the tribe of Iuda, the roote of Da∣uid, hathe obteyned too open the booke, and too looze the seuen seales therof. And one of the Elders. &c. S.The duetie of the ministers towarde suche as seke Christ After that the faythfull haue wayted paciently: in the ende they be rewarded with true vnderstanding: and afterwarde they receyue comfort, speci∣ally at the mouth of the Ministers, whose duetie it is to open him vnto the faythfull, which is the welspring of all wisdome and knowledge. VVeepe not. A. q. d. Let not thy heart fayle thée, although there be none founde in heauen, or in earth, or vnder the earth, that can open the booke or loozen the seales of it. Beholde, a Lyon of the tribe of Iuda.How Christe is both a Lion and a Lambe. The Elder calleth him héere a Lyon, whome Iohn beholdeth anone after in the shape of a Lambe, too the intent too rippe vp agayne the pro∣phecie of Iacob concerning the tribe of Iuda, partly fulfil∣led in Dauid as in the figure: but chiefly to bée afterwarde throughly fulfilled in Christ. For thus sayth that righteous Patriarke: Iuda is a Lyons whelpe: my sonne thou haste gone vp too thy pray, and haste couched thée downe too reste as a Lyon, and as a Lyonesse. Who wyll awake him? Gen. 49. b. 9. Moreouer, Christ is a Lion, for his strength, and a Lambe for the méekenesse of his minde, and for the sufferāce
of his passion. His Lyonlike strength is shewed by vanqui∣shing death. For he was shewed to be the son of God through power, according to the spirite of sanctification, in that he rose agayne from death. Rom. 1. a. 4. And he shewed him selfe a Lambe in lowlynesse of pacience, according to this saying, He was dumbe and opened not his mouth, lyke the sheepe before the shearer. Esai. 53. b. 7. Also, beholde the Lambe of God Iohn. 1. e. 36. The roote of Dauid, That is to say, of the séede of Dauid. A. For he hath an eye too the foresaying of the Pro∣phet concerning the Messias that was too come, where he sayth thus: But there shall spring a twigge out of the body of Iesse, and a braunche shall beare fruite oute of his roote. Esai. 2. a. 1. Hathe obteyned too open the booke, and too looze the seuen seales thereof. S. The time woulde come that the booke which (to the Prophets seeming) was not possible to be ope∣ned (and therfore muche lesse to be read of any mortal man) should one day be layde open to many men.The conuer∣sion of the Gentiles. For he propheci∣eth, that the tyme will come, that euen the deafe shal one day heare the words of this booke, Esay. 29. f. 18. which thing Iohn testifieth in this place to haue béene fulfilled by Christ. For the Gentiles, who in times past had béene deafe in hearing the worde of God: béeing nowe turned vnto Christ, herkened to the words of this booke, which the high minded doctors of the Lawe were not able so muche as once to open. 6. And I looked, and beholde in the middest of the throne, and of the foure Beastes, and in the middes of their Elders, there vvas a Lambe standing as though he had been slayne, hauing seuen hornes, and seuen eyes, vvhiche are the seuen spirites of God, sent into all the Earth. Howe Christ is both a lamb and a Lyon.And I looked, and beholde. &c. A. Now Iohn taketh heart to him agayne, and considereth aduisedly, who he is that is able to do that which no creature can do. A Lambe standing. He that a whyle agoe was called a Lyon, is nowe called a Lambe,
which most not seeme agaynst reason. Certesse Christ is both a Lyon and a Lambe: a Lyon truly (as hath béene sayd alrea∣dy) for his valiancie, stoutnesse, and incredible strength. For he hath abolished sinne, swalowed vp death, and vanquished that sturdie armed champion Satan: binding him, and ma∣king him as weake as a kix. A. Christes enimies then may be afrayde: for whome they despised in times past as a bace and cast away Lambe, him shall they one day féele to be a moste puissant Lyon, that is too say, a sore iudge and punisher.The surenesse and saetie of such as Christ hath taken charge o. Con∣trarywise all the godly which dwel vnder Christes protection may reioyce. For they bée out of daunger, bicause they haue a moste puissant defender, that is too wyt, the Lyon of the trybe of Iuda, who wyll not suffer the thing to bée plucked from him whiche he hath taken of his father too kéepe, lyke as no man aduentureth vpon a Lyon with his ease, to plucke the pray away from him. Esai. 31. b. 4. In respecte whereof Christe saythe moste truely of hys sheepe, no man shall plucke them out of my hande. Iohn. 10. e. 28. Also let the fayth∣full vnderstande, that they haue to deale with the Lambe, as ofte as they must come into the presence of God. For God who otherwise is a consuming fyre to the vngodly, Deut. 4. d. 24. and Hebr. 12. g. 29. is become a mercifull father vnto vs, bicause the sacrifice of this Lambe whiche was offered for vs, coulde not bée but moste acceptable vnto hym. S.Why Christ is say to be a Lambe. And ther∣fore in the holy Scriptures Christ is called a Lambe, bothe for his perfecte innocencie and soundnesse of lyfe, and also bicause hée was made a sacrifice and peace offering for oure sinnes. G. This Lambe is sayd too stande in the middest of the throne, and of the foure beastes, to doo vs to wit, that hée is not idle in heauen, as some heathenishe men surmise, but standeth and careth for the things that hee knoweth to bée for the profite of his Churche. As thoughe hee hadde beene slayne. Christ was slayne and dead in very déede:Christ was not quite for∣done or dispat∣ched by death. according as hée hym selfe confesseth afore. 1. d. 18. But it was Iohns mynde too vse the wordes, as thoughe, too the ende hee
might giue vs to vnderstande, that Christ was nothing lesse than quite fordone by death. A. Albeit that it were the thing which the Scribes, Pharisies, Priests, and chiefe Elders of the Iewes most wished.The godly do liue euen in death. After the same maner, although the faythful which are dayly haled vnto death for Christes names sake, séeme quite made away in the iudgement of the repro∣bates: yet in very déede they liue with their head Christ, and shall one day triumph ouer their enimies. Héere vpon the A∣postle sayth: For thy sake are wee deliuered to death all the day long, and wee haue béene counted as shéepe appoynted to the slaughter: but yet in all these things wée gette the vpper hande through him which hath loued vs. Rom. 8 g. 36.37. And agayne: as dying, and lo wée liue. 2. Corith. 6. b. 9. Hauing seuen hornes.The Prero∣gatiue of Chri¦stes power. S. By these is the prerogatiue of power (wher∣by Christe reigneth ouer all things) aptly betokened. For Christ is the heyre of all things. Hebr. 1. a. 2. Into whose han∣des the Father hath deliuered all things. Math. 11. d. 27. and. 28. d. 18. and Iohn. 13. a. 3. and. 17. b. 10. And hée hath giuen him a name which is aboue all names that are named, not only in this world, but also in the world to come. Phil. 2. b. 9. & Eph. 1. d. 21. A. Christ then is a Lambe, howbeit indued with singular strength, least any man mighte presume to make warre a∣gaynst him.The fulnesse of al know∣ledge is in Christ. And seuen eyes. By these words he meaneth, that the fulnesse of all knowledge resteth in Christ. For he kno∣weth as well things past and to come, as things present, ney∣ther are the secret thoughts of mens hearts hidden from him. 1. Cor. 4. a. 5. and Heb. 4. b. 13. and héeretofore. 2.23. Moreouer these two things, that is too wit, wisedome, that he can not by any meanes bee deceyued, and stoutnesse, that he may not be ouercome, are chiefly commended in a King and a Iudge. VVhiche are the seuen spirites of God sent into all the earth. Hée meaneth the giftes of the holy Ghost,The gifts of ye holy Ghost. whiche bee distri∣buted too the godly through the whole earth. A Of which gifts, sée the. 1. Cor. 12. a. 8.9.10.11.
7. And he came and toke the booke out of the right hande of him that sate vpon the throne. And he came. &c. M.Christ hath receyued all knowledge. Bicause Christes manhode hathe the knowledge of all the mysteries in the Scriptures, by ver∣tue of the vniting of it vnto the woorde: A. Christe is sayde too haue taken the booke of the ryght hande of God that sate vppon the throne. In respect whereof, hee himselfe said, my doctrine is not myne owne, but his that sent mee, euen the fathers. Iohn. 7. c. 16. And againe, The woord which you haue hearde is not myne, but his that sente mee, &c. Iohn. 14. d. 24. 8. And vvhen hee had taken the booke, The foure beastes and the foure and tvventie elders fell downe bee∣fore the Lamb, hauing eche of them harpes and golden vyols full of odoures, vvhiche are the prayers of the Sainctes. And vvhen he had taken the booke. G.Of the out∣ward worship¦ping and reue∣rencing of God. As oft as it is the Lor∣des pleasure too disclose his will, all creatures ought too sub∣mitte themselues before him, and too yéelde all glorie and ho∣nour vntoo him. Therfore when the Lamb had receyued the booke, The foure beastes, And the xxiiij elders fell downe, wit∣nessing the pure woorshipping of their hartes, by this out∣warde humbling of themselues: according as it oftentymes befalleth the faithfull, who being inflamed with greate zeale of loue towardes God, doo without coloring or superstition, vtter the deuotion that lyeth hid in the hart, now and then by the outwarde gesture of the bodie, according as wee reade of Moyses, and of Anne the mother of Samuell. Exodus. 14.15. and 1. Samuel. 1.13. Hauing eche of them harpes. S. G.Humblenesse depending wholly vpon God. By the harpes wée maye ryghtly vnderstande the heartes that bee thoroughly mortifyed by denying themselues, and which do father all their rightuousnesse only vpon their sauior Christ alone. For thys Sacrifice of prayse and ryghtuousnesse, is
the only song of the saincts that ringeth so shirle and swéete in the eares of God: as it is written in the Psalmes. 50.14.15. & 51. d. 17.19. And when it is sayde, Vntoo thée O Lord be righ∣teousnesse, but vnto vs open shame. Dani. 9. b. 7.8. Such ma∣ner of sorowfull and troubled heartes God wyll not despise. Psalme. 51.17. In whiche respecte the Elders are sayde too lay downe their Crownes heretofore,The spirituall seruice of God 4. b. 10. And golden vyals full of odours. By these vyalls may bée vnderstoode the spiri∣tuall seruice of God, which was shadowed in olde tyme vn∣der the incense and perfumes of the Tabernacle. And it com∣prehendeth the prayses and prayers wherewith the sainctes doo magnifie God, and call vpon him in the faith of Christ Ie∣su, whom they acknowledge too bée the onely Mediator be∣twixt God and man. And such manner of prayers cannot be but most acceptable vntoo God: nay rather he receyueth them as a swéete odour, and graunteth them for Christes sake. Therefore Dauid sayde, Let my prayer bee caryed vp as the frankincense in thy sight, and let the lyfting vp of my hands bée as an euening Sacrifice. Psalme. 141. a. 2. And ageine, the Lord is néere vntoo all them that call vpon him, yea vnto all them that call vpon him in truthe. Psalme. 145. d. 18.19.20. whiche thing Christe himselfe confirmeth more than once. Math. 18. c. 19.20. and 21. c. 22. and Mark. 11. c. 24. and Iohn. 15. b. 7. and. 16. c. 23. also looke Iames. 1. a. 5.6. and. 1. Iohn. 5. c. 14. Nowe too drawe this too the intercession of the sainctes that bée deade,Praying to Saincts. is too fond a mockerie. For vnder these figures and visions, Iohn describeth vntoo vs, not in what plyghte the Church shall bée in heauen: but in what plyght it is in thys worlde, according as shall bée tolde more largely hereafter. 9. And they sing a nevve song, saying: vvorthie art thou too receyue the booke and too open the seales of it: for thou vvarte slayne, and thou haste redeemed vs vnto God, by thine ovvne bloud, out of all kinreds, and tunges and people, and Nations.
And they sung a newe song. A. He calleth that a newe song,The song of saluation, and how hardly the worlde is brought to be∣leeue the Gos∣pell. which is vttered vpon the benefite of Redemption. S. Besides this, the truthe whiche had béene vnherde of from the begin∣ning, or rather incredible too the worlde, was auouched too the whole world by the holy men of God and made a commō matter too sing of: namely that in onely Christ crucifyed, re∣mission of sinnes, all righteousnesse, yea and euerlasting sal∣uation shoulde bée bestowed vpon them that beléeue. Thys truthe (I saye) dyd all the Prophetes beare witnesse of, though somewhat darkely, accordyng too that which is sayde in Luke. 24. f. 44. and Rom. 1. a. 2. But the worlde hath not be∣léeued it, according as Esay complaineth, Lord who hath be∣léeued at the héering of vs? Esai. 53. a. 1. Also at what tyme Christe testifyed the same truthe of himselfe, and auouched himselfe too bée sente for the same purpose, and the Iewishe Lawyers (who had the sayings of the prophets dayly in their handes) beléeued him not, but saide, thou bearest witnesse of thy selfe, and therefore thy witnesse is not true, Iohn. 8.13. Of whom also Iohn Baptist spake afore, saying: and no man re∣ceyueth hys witnesse, Iohn. 3. d. 32. And Christ himself sayth, If I speake the truthe why beléeue you mée not? Iohn. 8.46. But what speake wée of the Lawyers, séeyng that not euen hys owne Disciples were sufficiently assured of this truthe, before his death and resurrectiō, namely that forgiuenesse of sinnes, righteousnesse, and saluation were too bée asked and obteyned by hys name? Wherefore when he shoulde anone after go to his passion, he sayde: Hitherto yée haue asked no∣thing in my name, aske & yée shall receiue, that your ioy may bée ful, Iohn. 16.26. for althoughe they called not vpon God but by meane of the Mediator: yet notwithstanding, the knowledge of Christ, was as yet so darksome, that they wist not as yet howe too frame their prayers a ryghte vntoo hys name. Of this newe song we bee put in minde in the Psal. 96. a. 1. and. 98. a. 1. and. 149. a. 1. whiche doo treate of Christes kingdom. VVorthie art thou to receiue the booke. G. After beléef
foloweth vtterance of prayse.Beleefe in Christ bree∣deth praysing of God. And therfore the foure beastes and the .xxiiij. Elders S. sing a song of victorie and gladnesse, toogether with thanksgiuing, bycause the Father hath exal∣ted his sonne into his kingdome, for performing full obedi∣ence, and for humbling himselfe vnto death: and also hathe of good righte deliuered vnto him all power bothe in heauen & earth, forasmuch as it is he onely that hath fulfilled the fa∣thers will in all poyntes, and wholly giuen vp himselfe too the aduauncing of his glorie:Christ hauing opened heauen by his passion, giueth abūdāt knowledge to them that be∣leeue in him. And to open the seales of it. This did Christ bring to passe, at suche tyme as becomming man according to the foresayings of the Prophets, hee suffered death for witnessing the truth, and after he had triumphed o∣uer death, returned from the graue with conquest, and moū∣ting vp intoo heauen poured down the holie Ghost, the boun∣tiful bestower of heauenly graces vpō his seruant, fulfilling the Scriptures, and making them so manifest, that hence∣foorth, were things neuer so farre hidden out of sighte, yet are they easyly séen of them that beleue in Christ. For as Paule sayth, the ende of the lawe is Chryst. Rom. 10. a. 4. Also, All of vs beholding the glorie of the Lord in a mirrour with o∣pen face, are chaunged vnto the same similitude from glorie vnto glory, as of the spirit of the Lord. 2. Cor. 3. d. 18. For thou wart slain.Gods loue to∣wards man∣kinde. A. Then doth Christs death minister vs large mat∣ter of praysing God. For héerein appeered his woonderfull goodnesse & incredible regard towards vs, that he spared not his owne sonne, but gaue him for vs al. Rom. 8.32. And thou hast redemed vs.Euen the ho∣lyest men haue neede of redēp¦tion by Christ Christ suffred not at al aduentures: but to re∣déeme vs, which erst were the diuels bondslaues, and to saue vs that were forlorne. For the sonne of man is come to séeke and to saue that whiche was loste. Luke. 19.10. Also he hathe plucked vs out of the power of darkenesse, and conueyed vs into the kingdome of his beloued sonne, in whome we haue redēption & remission of sins. Colo. 1.13.14. G. Here we sée how ther hath bin no mā so holy & excellent in gods church, but he had need of redemption: and also that forgiuenesse of sinnes
dependeth vpon the only sacrifise of Christes death: according as it is sayd. Rom. 3.25. Vnto God.The ende of our redemp∣tion. The end of the redemption purchaced by Christ, is not that we should be seruants to the lusts of the flesh: but like as Christ being once dead vnto sin dyeth now no more, but lyueth euermore vnto God: so must we also walke in newnesse of lyfe, Rom. 6. a. 4. B. Wherevpon Zacharie said, That we being deliuered out of the hande of our enimies might serue him in holinesse. &c. Luke. 1.74. And Paule speaketh of Christ thus: who gaue himselfe for vs, to redéeme vs from all iniquitie, and to clenze vs vnto himselfe, that we might be his peculiar people and followers of good works. Tit. 2.14. That is to say, (as it is sayd in the Hebr. 9.14.) he hath clenzed our consciences from dead works, that we might serue the liuing God. A. Therefore we be not redée∣med, neyther to the flesh, no nor yet to our selues, but to God the father, according to the appointment of whose will it be∣commeth vs to frame all the doings of our life. Wherevppon we gather also, that Christes death is after a manner re∣nounced of all suche as liue to any thing else than to God on∣ly. By thine owne bloud.Popish Pur∣gatory, and sa∣tisfaction, and the sacrices of the old law. This parcell is woorth the conside∣ring, againste the popish purgatorie and the vaine satisfacti∣ons of men. Also the bloud of Christe is matched againste all the offerings and sacrifices of the old law. Héerevppon the A∣postle saythe, Christe being an high preeste of good things to come, came by a greater and perfecter tabernacle, not made with hands, (that is to say not of this manner of building:) neyther by the bloud of Goates and Calues, but by his owne bloud entered he once (for all) into the holy place, and founde euerlasting redemption. Hebr. 9. c. 11.12. And Peter: for as∣much as ye know that ye were not redéemed with corrupti∣ble things, (as siluer and gold,) from your vayne conuersati∣on which ye had receiued by the traditions of your fathers, but with the precious bloud of Christ as of a lamb vndefyled and without spot. 1. Peter. d. 18.19. A. Also looke afore in. 1. b. 5. Out of all kinreds, and Tungs, and people, and nations. S. He she∣weth
that the Church of Christ is gathered out of all people and all nations.Christs chur∣che is gathe∣red out of all Nations. Which thing had bin prophesyed long ago, Gen. 22. d. 18. &. 49. b. 10. &. Esay. 2. a. 2. For he is not the God of the Iewes only, but of the Gentiles also. Rom. 3. d. 29. And hée hath shut vp all vnder vnbeléefe, that he might haue mercie on al. Rom. 11. d. 32. Herevpon Christ sayd, I haue other shéepe which are not of this fold, and I must bring them to it, and then shall there be one fold and one shepeherd. Iohn. 10. c. 16. And Paule calleth the Ephesians that were conuerted to the Christian faith, felowcitizens of the Sainctes, and the house∣hold,No accepting of persons with God. meyny of God. Eph. 2.19. And Peter in expresse wordes auoucheth, that there is no accepting of persons with God, but that in all nations he that feareth God and worketh righteousnesse is accepted of him. Act. 10. e. 34.35. Iohn there∣fore in these words (lyke as Paule doth dyuers tymes) com∣mendeth the inestimable richnesse of Gods goodnesse, where∣through he is bountifull vnto all them that call vppon hym, whither they be Iewes or whither they be Gréekes. And su∣erly it was no trifling miracle, that so dyuerse superstitions and trades of liuing, could linke togither into one Religion. 10. And hast made vs kinges and preestes vnto oure God, and vve shall reygne vpon the earth. And hast made vs kinges and preestes. A. Looke before. 1. b. 6. And we shall reigne vppon the earth. S. Some of the auncienter bookes haue, And they shall reigne vpon the earth. For where∣as otherwise it should haue bin said, we shall reigne: the godly, for modesties sake, speaking of thēselues by way of imbace∣ment, (as it were of other men,) séeme to alter the person, saying:A comfort for such as bee wrongfully oppressed and persecuted for Christes sake. And they shall reigne. P. Othersome reade it, And wee haue reigned. But the verb of the tyme to come agréeth better with the text. For this is added in way of comforting, to the end that al the godly may vnderstand, how ye wicked shal not euermore beare sway, but that the mightie shall one day bée pulled downe from their thrones, and the lowely bée exalted
in their steades: according to that which the prophet saythe, thou shalt saue the poore people, and thou shalt bring the lof∣tie eyes low. Psalm. 18. c. 26. And againe, The Lorde loueth his people, he shall glorifie his méeke ones in welfare. The Sainctes shall triumph in glorie, they shall sing in their beddes. The aduauncings of God shall bée in their mouthe, and two edged swords in their hands. &c. Psal. 149. a. 6. Also, Marie the mother of Christ saith thus in hir song: he hathe pulled downe the mightie from their seate, and hathe exalted the lowly and méeke, Luke. 1. e. 52. A. And yet wée must not thinke, that the godly shall so reigne vpon earth, but that the world shall always put them to trouble. By reason whereof they haue euer néede of patience, that thereby they may pos∣sesse their soules and enioy true peace in Christ. 11. And I looked, and heard the voyce of many An∣gelles about the throne, and about the beastes, and the Elders, and I heard thousands of thousands. And I looked and hard the voyce. &c. A.Auouchment of Christes Godhead. Iohns drift is alto∣gither this: namely, too shewe that Christ (as too whome the Angelles do diligent seruice) is bothe more excellent than the Angelles, and also lord ouer them; contrarie to the error, as well of the Iewes as of the Cerinthus and of other here∣tikes. Which thing euen Christ himselfe doth, in Math. 24.31. &. 26. e. 53. and also his Apostles, Eph. 1.21. and. Coloss. 1. b. 16. &. Hebr. 1. b. 4. B. Therefore he bringeth in the Angelles yéelding prayse vnto Christe, and thanking him for the benefyte of mans redemption. About the throne and about the beastes and the elders. G.Gods mini∣sters doo set foorth his prayse. The ministers of the Lorde which are round a∣bout his throne, readie to do whatsoeuer he commaundeth them, do magnifye and aduaunce hys maiestie: according to the saying of the prophet, Blisse yée the Lord yée Angelles of his, mighty in strēgth, which do his commandemēt & are obe∣dient to ye voice of his saying. Blisse yée the Lord all yée hosts of his, ye seruants of his which do his wil. Psal. 103. d. 20. And
I heard thousands of thousands. M. He putteth a number certein for a number infinite to himselfe, howbeit not infinite vnto God. For all the Angels confesse the same thing with one minde and consent, according to this saying of the Apostle, And let all tungs confesse that the Lord Iesus is Christe, too the glory of God the father. Phil. 2. b. 11. Sée Dan. 7. c. 10. A. There be some which following other Gréeke copies tran∣slate it, In number a thousand times an hundred thousande, and ten times an hundred thousand. 12. Saying vvith a loude voyce, The Lamb that vvas killed is vvorthy to receiue myght, andSome reade riches. Godhead and vvisdome, and strength, and honour, and glorie, and blessing. The gladnesse of the godly.Saying vvith a loud voyce. C. This loud voyce betokeneth the excéeding great and incredible gladnesse, which maketh all the rightuous too leape for ioye, as well at the opening of the booke, as for the victorie atchéeued by the Lamb. Also ther∣by is signifyed the pure and stedfast profession of the truthe, and earnest thanksgiuing. The Lamb that was killed is worthie. A.Why Christs death is men∣tioned so oftē. Bycause the welfare of all the godly is grounded vpon the death of Christ: there is often mention made of it in the scrip∣tures, to the intent the faithfull should learne, not to hope for life elsewhere than in his death. To receiue might and Godhed. S. G.Christes sin∣gular prayse. Here be seauen notable and deuine titles attributed vnto Christ: namely, might, Godhead, wisedome, strength, honor, glory, and blissing: wherein is comprised the whole summe of all things that may be atributed vnto Christ to his praise. Might or mightinesse is that power which is the maker and lifegiuer whereof Iohn speaketh in his firste chapter and fourth verse,Mighte or mightinesse. and whereof mention is made in the Epistle too the Hebrewes the first chapter and third verse. And GodheadGodhead. (for so must we say if we folow the old Interpreter) is attri∣buted vnto him, bycause the same belongeth vnto him by na∣ture, whereas others haue it but by adoption or participa∣tion.
For the word was God, Iohn. 1. a. 1. And vvisdome,Wisdome. which appeareth in the distinguishing, ordering, beautifying, operation, and interchange of things created, and consequēt∣ly in the most agreable gouernment of the whole. A. By rea∣son whereof he is also called the very wisedome of God. Luke. 11.49. And strengthStrength. in vanquishing his aduersarie po∣wers, and in ministring Iustice. Of which strength yée haue in Ephes. 4.10. &. Coloss. 2.14.15. H Honor, Glory, and Blissing,Honor, glorye, and blessing. belong to the commendation of hys bounteous goodnesse, wherethrough he prouideth for al things by him created, like a kindharted and liberall father, according to this saying, All things wayte vppon thée, that thou mayest giue them foode in due time. Psalm. 104. d. 27. And agayne, The eyes of all things trust in thée O Lord, and thou geuest them foode in due season: thou openest thy hand, and fillest euery liuing thing with thy blissing. Psalm. 145.15.16. These so great roy∣alties do those heauenly spirites both witnesse and commend in our Lord Christ the maker and preseruer of all things: as if they should say, Thou onely among all the sonnes of God, art worthy to be inhonored with these renoumed titles, and to be called the might of God, Rich in al things, wise, strong, honorable, and blissed or commendable. M. This is it that Paule méeneth by saying, he hath giuen him a name. whyche is aboue all names, that in the name of Iesus all knées should how. &c. Philip. 2.9.10. &. Ephes. 1. d. 21.22. And (sayth the prophet) his name shall be called the wonderfull, the counsel∣ler, the mightie God, the father of the world to come, the prince of peace. &c. Esay. 9. b. 5. 13. And all the creatures that are in heauen, and on the earth, and vnder the earth, and in the sea, and all the things that are in thē I hard saying, blissing, and honor, & glorie, and povver, be vnto him that sitteth vpon the throne, and vnto the Lamb for euermore.
In what wife all creatures honor Christ.And all the Creatures that are in heauen. M. For asmuch as Christ is ordeyned by the father to be the heire of all thynges Hebr. 1.2. A. It is good right that all creatures should yeeld him his due honor. S. G. Therfore not only holy men & those heauē∣ly powers (of whom according to the Prophet Dan. 7.10. the multitude is innumerable) acknowlege Christ for their king, and wish al good lucke and prosperitie to his kingdome: but al∣so al the vnreasonable and spéechelesse creatures do also ad∣uance him their maker & preseruer, according to the measure of their capacitie: that is to wit, in mouing and working ac∣cording to the boundes that are appointed vnto them, whyle they be ready at his becke: whyle they minister vnto the god∣ly, things néedful to the honoring of his name: and while they fight against the vngodly for the maintenance of his glory. A. For the Lord preserueth both man and beast. Psal. 36. b. 6. And the Rauens birds are sayd after a sort to call vpon him. Psal. 147.Popish pur∣gatorie. a. 9. G. Neuerthelesse vpon this place the papists la∣bor to build their forged purgatory. But how fondly (& much more wickedly:) the matter itselfe bewrayeth. For what ma∣ner of creatures suppose they to be reckened vp héere? It is as certaine as certeintie itselfe, that here are comprehended both the things that want reason & the things that want lyfe. B. Wherby nothing else is auouched, but that all parts of the world from the highest top of heauen to the lowest poynte of the earth, do after their manner shew foorth the glory of theyr maker. A. After whiche manner Dauid also speaketh of the heauens: The heauens declare the glory of God, and the fir∣mament sheweth foorth his handyworks. Psal. 19. a. 1. Wher∣fore letting those blind hastelers alone, let vs admit none o∣ther fire of purgatory, thā the bludshed of Iesus Christ, wher∣by we know that the clenzing of our sinnes was fully perfec∣ted, according as it is written in Coloss. 1. b. 14. & Hebr. 1. a. 3. Blissing,Blessing of umb crea∣tures. and honor, and glory. &c. S. Blissing, is when they be so diligent in laying to continue their posteritie for euer by be∣getting their like, that they resemble the starres, whiche by
their returning about againe, do after a sort renew agayne. Honor,How ye dumbe creatures ho∣nor God. How they yeelde glory vnto God. is when the creatures imploy themselues to mās be∣hoofe. Glory is when they performe Gods commaundemēts. Power or might is when they eyther cease or fayle at hys a∣pointment, according to this saying, Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall decay and returne into their duct. And againe, thou shalt send foorth thy spirit, and they shal bée created. Psal. 104. d. 29.30. So also is there much of this mat∣ter in the psalmes. 29. b. 8. &. 149. b. 5.There is no honoring of God without honoring of Christ. Moreouer it is to be con∣sidered, that the same titles and the same prayses that are gi∣uen to him which sitteth vpon the throne, are also gyuen vn∣to the Lamb: which thing Iohn obserueth continually in this booke. A. to the intent we may vnderstand, that no man ser∣ueth, prayseth, & honoreth God aright, which holdeth skorne to honor Christ. For this saying is knowen, He that honoreth not the sonne, honoureth not the father whych sente him, Iohn. 5. d. 23. 14. And the foure beasts sayd Amen. And the .xxiiij. Elders fell dovvne vppon their faces, and vvorshipped him that liueth for euer and euer. And the foure beasts sayd Amen. A.All the godly consent in the honoring of God and the Lambe. For asmuch as this vtte∣rance of prayse whyche all creatures giue to the lyuing God, differeth not from that prayse whych the foure beastes gaue in the twelfth verse of this present Chapter: they doo not a∣misse to adde this word Amen, which among the Hebrues im∣plyeth the force, both of wishing, and of consenting. And the xxiiij. elders fell downe. &c. S. Thus farre at length doth the or∣derlinesse, beautie, and obedience of things created, leade vs of necessitie, to feare, honor, and aboue all things to loue the one God the father, and his sonne Iesus Christ,Wherevnto the considera∣tion of Gods creatures lea∣deth vs. according as the Apostle said, To God the king of all worlds, immortall, inuisible, and only wyfe, be honor and glory for euer and e∣uer. Amen. 1. Tim. 1. d. 7.
The sixthe Chapter. ANd I savv vvhen the Lamb had opened one of the Seales, and I heard one of the foure beastes saying as it vvere the noyse of thunder, Come and see. The summe of this chap∣ter.ANd I saw when the Lamb had opened one of the Seales. A. In this Chapter is described how mi∣serable and despised the estate of the Churche is to sée too, by reason of the great troubles, wherby Satan laboreth to abolish the truth of the Gospell, and to wipe it quite and cleane out of mēs harts. Herevpon all the godly make incessant prayer, that all wic∣kednesse may be taken away, and the glory of the Lorde be only aduanced, whiche thing notwithstanding shall not come to passe, before the appointed day of iudgement, which as all the vngodly do now cast farre off from themselues, so shall they not be able to abide it in his season when it commeth. S. And héere Iohn séemeth to lay foorthe the thinges in order, whiche he had spoken very bréefly afore: namely that the Lamb tooke the sayd booke, & was iudged by all the sitters by, to be worthy too open the seales of it. G. Now although thys vision be somewhat darke: yet notwithstanding (by Gods grace) wée shall easly perceyue what it betokeneth, by lay∣ing other scriptures vnto it. As it were the noyse of thunder. A.The maiestie of gods voyce. Séeing that the Lord filleth heauen and earth with his ma∣iestie, it must not séeme straunge if his voyce be lyke the noyse of thunder, when he goeth about to vtter his will vnto men. Lyke as in old time when he was about to giue hys Law to his people, we reade he did the like in Exod. 20. c. 18. Therefore although one of the foure beastes be sayd to haue vttered thys voyce: yet no doubt but there appéered a cer∣tayne power of the Godhead, whych did both shew the great∣nesse of the thinges that were to be spoken, and also make
Iohn the more attentiue to heare them. Come and see. S.Come by be∣leuing, and see by taking heede. Hée admonisheth vs, first that wée muste come, by beléeuing the Scriptures simply: and secondly that wée must take heede to suche mysteries as lye hidden and shutte vp within the let∣ter of them. 2. And I savve, and beholde a vvhyte horse, and he that sate vpon him had a bovve: and there vvas giuen vnto him a crovvne, and he vvent out conquering, and too conquere. And I savve, and beholde a vvhyte horse. A.The state of the Churche vnder the A∣postles. Omitting the di∣uersitie of interpretations, whiche hathe ouercast things with a greater darknesse, wée will holde vs contented with the playne exposition, and alleage only such things as shall seeme to make to the aduauncement of Christes glorie, and to the edifying of his Churche. For sure wée are, that it was Iohns purpose, to describe the state of the Churche vnto vs, and as it were too lay it foorth before the eyes of the faythfull vnder sundry figures, visions, and Types. Wherfore the simplyer that these things be layde foorth, so much the greater fruite doo wée hope that the Churche shall reape by them. And séeing that Christ is the marke wherat all things ame that are writ∣ten in the Scripture: we must thinke it is he that is described vnto vs in this place, vnder the figure of the white horse, and the ryder that sittes vpon his backe. G.All faythfull ministers are Christes hor∣ses. For the white horse shadoweth vnto vs the Apostles and shepheards, and all the faythfull ministers of Gods worde, whome Christ vseth as his horses in that spirituall encounter, which he vndertaketh agaynst the world, the diuell, and sinne. And these horses are called whyte, for the purenesse of the doctrine whiche they preache, and for the soundnesse of their lyfe. For the herd∣men of the Churche ought to be suche, as (if it were possible) they should giue no cause of stumbling vntoo others, but hée founde vnblamable bothe in conuersation and doctrine: ac∣cording as it is written. 2. Corinth. 6. a. 3. and. 1. Tim. 3. a. d.
and Tit. 1. b. 6. and. 2. b. 7. and. 1. Peter. 5. a. 3. In consideration whereof Christe tearmeth them the light of the worlde, and the salte of the earth. Math. 5. b. 13. G. Therefore lyke as a horse obeyeth his ryder, and is readie too serue his master at all assayes: too runne if he will haue him runne, and to stand still if he will haue him stande still: A Euen so the Apostles and Shepheardes haue respecte onely vnto Christ, and bende themselues wholly to the executing of his commandements. Wèe reade howe it was sayde of the Apostle Paule, hée is a chosen vessell of myne to carie my name before Kinges and Nations, and before the children of Israell. Acts. 9. c. 15. And to the rest of the Apostles commaundement was giuen: Go and preache the Gospell vnto all creatures. Mark. 16. c. 15. Teache yee all people, baptizing. &c. Math. 28. d. 19. Whiche thing howe diligently they perfourmed, Marke him selfe de∣clareth, saying: And they going their wayes preached euery where, the Lorde working with them, and confirming their sayings by miracles that insued after. &c. Marke. 16. d. 20. Lo héere the whyte horse and his Ryder. Besides this, lyke as a horse goeth not whyther he lysteth him selfe, but is guy∣ded and ruled at the pleasure of the horseman: euen so of the Apostles, some were sent too the Iewes, and some too Nations farre off: and so also were they directed by theyr Ryder Christ, so as they wente whither soeuer it lyked him. Héerevpon Luke writeth thus of Paule and Silas: When they had trauelled ouer Phrygia, and the Countrie of Gala∣tia, and were forbidden by the holy Ghost to preache the worde in Asia: they tooke their way intoo Mysia, purposing to goo into Bithynia: But the holye Ghoste suffered them not. Acts. 16. b. 6.7. Furthermore lyke as a horse is nowe and then pricked wyth the spurre, that hée maye doo hys duetie the rightlyer and clearelyer: euen so are afflictions nowe and then layde vpon the Pastors, that they should not bee lazie in the charge that they take in hande, but bée quic∣kened vp more and more. In whiche respecte wée reade how
it was sayde of Paule, I will shewe him how great things he muste suffer for my names sake. Acts. 9. c. 16. And he him selfe wytnesseth of him selfe, Least I should haue béene ex∣alted out of measure throughe the excellencie of Reuelati∣ons, there was gyuen vntoo mée a pricking throughe the fleshe, the messenger of Satan too buffer mée, least I might bée exalted aboue measure. 2. Corinth. 12. c. 7. And vnto Pe∣ter Christe sayde: Verily I saye vnto thée, when thou werte yong thou dyddest gyrde thy selfe, and walke whi∣ther thou wouldest: but when thou arte olde, thou shalte put foorth thy handes, and another shall girde thée, and leade thée whither thou wouldest not. Iohn. 21.18. And hee that sate vpon hym hadde a bowe. Wée haue sayde alreadie, that the Ryder of the Whyte horse is Chryste, S.Christes Gos∣pell is likened to a bowe and arrowes. whome Iohn armeth wyth a bowe of warre lyke a conquerour. A. B. The bowe is Chrystes Gospell, the preaching wher∣of is disposed at hys pleasure. S. Therefore lyke as the eni∣mies bée ouerthrowen by the arrowes whiche the bowe shooteth oute a farre off: euen so the Nations that were farre off, are subdued vntoo Chryste by the preaching of the Gospell. Ephesi. 2.13. B. Thys dyd Christe promise too hys Disciples, saying: I wyll gyue you a mouth and wise∣dome, whiche all they that shall bée agaynst you, shall not bée able too gaynesaye nor gaynestande. Luke. 21.15. And Paule following the Prophet saythe, I wyll destroy the wysedome of the wyse, and shake off the vnderstanding of the skylfull. Esai. 29.14. and. 1. Cor. 1.19. Also the wea∣pons of oure warfare are not fleshely, but myghtie too Godwarde. &c. 2. Corinth. 10.4. A. Wherevnto perteyne those thinges whiche are written of the power and efficacie of Gods worde, in the Psalme. 45. b. 6. and. 1. Corinth. 14. c. 24. and Hebr. 4. c. 12. And there was giuen vntoo hym a Crowne. S.Christes con∣quest. A Crowne whiche is the token of the attaynemente and quiete possession of a kingdome, is iustly attributed vnto Christe, A. bicause it is onely he that hath vanquished sinne,
death and the Diuell, as it hath béene sayde alreadie. And he went out conquering, and for too conquere. It is an Hebrue phrase, whereby the Hebrues are wont to betoken aswell ve∣hementnesse and holding on, as also certeintie or assurednesse. Christ therefore incountreth not with his enimies of euen hande, but as one that is sure of the victorie beforehande For it could not otherwise come to passe, but that righteousnesse should ouercome sinne, the light it selfe ouercome the Prince of darkenesse, and lyfe ouercome death. Euen so at this day the faythfull (and specially the ministers of the word) which fighte vnder Chrystes banner agaynste the power of the worlde, must assure them selues of the victorie, although they bee fayne too endure many things from tyme too tyme.No true whit¦nesse in the Popish Cler∣gie. But nowe a dayes in the Popedome a man shall not finde white horses among them that brag them selues to be the herdmen of Churches. For their doctrine is vncleane and their lyfe lothsome to God, and all godly men. And therefore they glorie in vayne of the succession of the Apostles, as wée haue she∣shed oftentimes alreadie. 3. And vvhen he had opened the second seale, I herd the seconde beast saying, Come and see. The state of the Churche in martyrdome vnder the Ro∣mane Empe∣rours.And when he had opened the seconde seale. S. This seconde seale signifieth the state of the Churche (whiche is Christes kingdome) in the tyme of the Martyrs vnder the Romayne Emperours, from Steuen the fyrst Martyr, vnto Constan∣tine the great, and so foorth vnto the ende of the worlde. M. For the truthe of the Gospell could not bée preached, but the worlde muste bée set on a roare, and the wicked ministers of Satan bée inflamed with madnesse agaynst the preachers and professours thereof. Wherefore it stoode all the godly in hande, specially to haue singular patience, whereby too stande inuincible agaynst so many lettes whiche the worlde dydde caste in their wayes. Héereof Iohn treateth in this seconde seale. Come and see. q. d. Marke aduisedly what I
shall shewe vnto thée, that thou mayest open them vnto o∣thers also. 4. And there vvente foorth an other horse vvhich vvas redde, and vntoo him that sate thereon, it vvas gi∣uen to take peace from the earthe, that they shoulde slea one an other: and there vvas giuen vnto him a greate svvorde. And there went forth an horse which was red. A.Cruel tyrants & persecuters of the church. Like as the whyte horse did figure vntoo vs the faithfull Apostles and mi∣nisters of Christ, which bring tidinges vnto men, of nothing but peace and attonement, Chryst their rider sending them and guiding them at his pleasure: so nowe the red horse be∣tokeneth the cruell tyrantes and persecuters of the Churche, whiche are neuer satisfied with the bloud of Christes seruan∣tes, but are always breathing out manaces and slaughters, imploying their whole force to this poynt, namely to doo all things as they list themselues, and to take their plesure with∣out care, by quenching the truth of the Gospell. This is the fourth beast of whom mention is made in Daniell. 7.7. By which is betokened the Romaine Empire. And vnto him that sate theron. A. This rider is the deuill,The Diuell & hys inflaming of Princes a∣gaynst the Gospell. the prince and head of all the vngodly, who worketh what he listeth in the stubborn∣harted children. It vvas giuen too take peace from the earth. M. That is too saye, God had giuen him leaue too sette men at oddes among themselues, and too stirre vp verie great trou∣bles, that therby the patience of the godlie mighte be tryed. S. For that moste vngracious and cruell horseman, was a murtherer from the begynnyng and abode not in the truthe: Iohn. 8.44. So hathe he easyly driuen the Prin∣ces of this worlde vntoo horrible slaughters, which of theyr owne accorde haue alreadie bin too headstrong agaynst the truthe. For howe the Romaines haue demeaned themsel∣ues that they myght reigne ouer the whole worlde alone, it is easy to bée gathered by histories. They haue shed muche
bloud in all places of the earthe: and also they haue dispatched one another with ciuill battell. And in the meane whyle they haue also made innumerable slaughters of Martyrs, vnder Nero, Domitian, Traiane, Antonine, Seuerus, Maximine, Decius, Valerian, Diocletian, and Maxent: of whome yée shall finde in order in the Ecclesiasticall historie of Eusebius. But by the way it is a comfort,The diuel can doe no more than God wil gyue hym leaue. that the diuell can doo no∣thing at all against the godly, further than God giueth him leaue: that is too wit, that the glorie of God, and the vertue of the godly may become the more apparant, according as a man may see in Ioh. 1.12. and in other places. A. Wherevpon Christ saide vntoo Peter, Simon, Simon, beholde, Satan hath craued you, that he myghte boulte you as Wheate is boulted: but I haue prayed for thée that thy faythe may not fayle.Persecutions for the Gos∣pels sake. Luke. 22. d. 31. That they should slea one another. S. Many vnderstande thys too bée spoken of the Iewishe Natiō, which murthered themselues myserably by inwarde seditions, be∣fore they were assayled wyth warre by the Romanes: which thing Iosephus reporteth them too haue done euen wythin theyr owne walles, when they were nowe besieged by the Romane armie. A. But more ryghtly doo others referre it too the persecutions that were raysed for the Gospells sake. For too set oute the crueltie of men more at large, Iohn séemeth too glaunce at those diuisions whiche happen for the Gospell euen in these our dayes, when the father is diuided from the Sonne, the Sonne from the Father, and the Mother from the Daughter: when the brother delyuereth the brother vn∣too death, when the children ryse vp ageynst their parentes and put them too death, and when a mannes owne house∣holde bée hys enemyes, accordyng as Chryst hath tolde vs aforehande,Howe God & Satan maye worke bothe one thing. Math. 10.35.36. A. Neyther must it séeme ageynst reason, that thys place auoucheth the same thyng too bée ve∣rifyed vpon Satan, which Christ after a sorte attributeth too hymselfe. For one selfe same worke (howbeit in farre diuerse respectes) is sometyme fathered bothe vpon God,
and vpon his enemie Satan accordyng too the saying of the Prophet, Blind thou the eyes of this people, that in séeyng they may not sée, and in héering they maye not vnderstande. &c. Esai. 6. c. 9. and also accordyng too Paule who saythe, In whome the God of this worlde hathe blinded the wyttes of the vnbeléeuers, that they might not bée inlyghtened by the glorious brightnesse of Christes Gospell who is the image of God. 2. Cor. 4. a. 4. In which sentences the blinding of the vn∣beléeuers is fathered bothe vpon God and also vpon Satan. And the scripture teacheth that Satan blindeth men, not on∣ly by Gods sufferance, but also by his cōmaundement, too the ende too execute hys vengeance. So was Achab deceyued by Satan. But coulde Satan doo that of himselfe? No truely. But when he had profered his seruice too doo harme, God sent him too bée a lying spirit in the mouthes of all Prophets 3. Kings. 22. d. 22.Why God is sayde to blinde men. And surely the cause why God is sayde too blynde men, is for that when he hath berefte them of righte vnderstanding of minde, and of the lyght of his holy spirit, he gyueth them vp too the diuell too bée caryed away into a wil∣full wicked mind, Rom. 1. d. 28. and sendeth them strong illu∣sions, 2. Thessa. 2. c. 11. and so executeth iust vengeance vpon them by the minister of his wrath. And there was giuen vntoo him a great sworde. By the terme sworde,Power to do harme and mischiefe. is betokened the power too hurte and too slea, wherewyth the deuill and the vngodly are armed by Gods permission. But wée muste marke what Christ sayth too comfort vs withall. Bee not a∣frayde of suche as kill but the bodie, and cannot kill the soule &c, Math. 10. c. 28. 5. And vvhen he had opened the thirde Seale, I hearde the third beaste, saying, Come and see. And I savv, and beholde a blacke horse, and he that sate vpon him had a payre of balances in his hand. And when he had opened the thirde seale. Forasmuch as the persecutiō of ye church is not at one time only nor of one sort.
but Satan assaulteth it diuers wayes too oppresse it vtterly,Inward per∣secution by Heretikes and false teachers. and to put it quite out of estimation: Iohn speaketh of ano∣ther spyce of persecution which is done by heretikes, decey∣uers, and maisters of lying. And such manner of persecution is so muche the more noysome and daungerous than the for∣mer, as it stealeth vpon men with lesse adoo. For now & then it falleth out, that they which with a stout corage despysed the outward persecutiō of the sword, and yéelded not too any ter∣riblenesse of mē, are infected with mens venemons doctrine, & imbrace lyes in sted of the truth. Besides this, the wounds that are smitten by heretikes are scarce euer healed. Where∣fore we must take good héede, that Satan assaile vs not this way, and put vs too the foyle. Come and see. This parcel is re∣peated, too make him the more attentiue. A. q. d. See thou let not slip the things that are shewed thee. And beholde a blacke horse.The diuels work folks. A. B. Héere he shadoweth vnto vs all deceiuers, heretikes false Apostles, and workfolkes of Satan: who forasmuch as they bée of the deuils sending into the worlde, can bryng no∣thing vpon it but darkenesse. Concerning these, sée Math. 7. b. 15. and 24 b. 24. and Rom. 16. c. 17.18. and 2. Cor. 11. c. 13. and Philip. 3. d. 18.19. and 2. Petr. 2. a. 1.2.3. and. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 18. and Iud. a. 4.False apostles much set by in the worlde. And he that sate vpon him had a paire of balances. This giueth vs too vnderstand, that the deceiuers and maisters of lying are much set by among ye people, who hang altogither vpon their mouth, and receiue all their decrées as an answer from God: whiche thing is too bee seene in the Popedome, where the determinations of the M. of the faculties (as they terme it) are preferred before the holy word of God, not with out horrible dishonor too the sonne of God.The Popes Luciferlike pride. And no maruell, séeing that their high byshop the Pope maketh his vaunts, that he himselfe may iudge all men, and no man maye iudge him. Now then séeing he hath so easely obteined this thing at the handes of them which worship him as God: what won∣der is it if he haue spred abrode innumerable errors, & there∣by quenched the light of the Gospell in his kingdome?
6. And I hearde a voyce in the middes of the foure beastes, saying: a Chaenix of VVheate for a pennie, and three Chaenixes of barly for a pennie, and vvyne and oyle hurt thou not. And I herde a voyce. &c. G. This voyce is (by some mennes iudgement) attributed too the deceyuers and heretikes, who in the middes of the Churche, chalendge too themselues au∣thoritie too iudge all men, and at their owne pleasure sell Wheate and barley wherewith the people is susteyned, that is too say, they offer their owne wicked traditions too the hun∣grie in sted of Gods holie woords, as thoughe there were in them some souereine power too féede the soules that couet too hée saued. But more rightly doo others attribute thys voyce vntoo Christ, who is woont too open vntoo his seruauntes the things that are too come, too the intente they may laye for themselues in tyme. A Chaenix of VVheate for a Pennye.A Chenix. A Chenix is a measure of all manner of grayne, conteyning as muche as maye suffise for one dayes foode. Budaeus in his fifth booke de Asse, déemeth a Chenix to weye foure pounde: and Pollux thinketh it too weye but three pound. And three Chaenixes of barley for a Pennye. B. When the Prophete Eli∣zeus ment too betoken abundance of grayne, he sayd, By too morrowe thys tyme there shall bee a bushell of fine flo∣wer for a Sycle, and two bushelles of barley for a Sycle in the gate of Samaria. 4. Kings. 7. a. 1.Christes fore∣care for his chosen. And Iohn purposing too betoken the dearth of victualls, sayth, that one Chenix of Wheate shall bée woorthe a pennie, and thrée Chenixes of barley woorthe a pennye for (as wée haue touched alreadie) Christ is woonte too forewarne hys faythfull (of whom he hathe a speciall care) of inconueniences too come, and too prouyde foode for them in due tyme: according as he dyd in olde tyme for the householde of Iacob by Ioseph, in Egypt, Gene. 41. d. 38. And in the tyme of Helizeus for the people of Samaria, 4. Kings. 7. a. 1. And for his owne Disciples af∣ter
his ascention.Gods mercy∣fulnesse in cha¦sing. Act. 11. d. 28. And wyne and oyle hurt thou not. By this parcell an incling is giuen, that things are lyghtly neuer so scarse, but that there is alwayes some ouerplus re∣maining. For althoughe men prouoke Gods wrath by their wicked déedes: yet is hée not woont too punishe them with extremitie: but euen when he is angrie, he remembereth his mercie, and dothe them good euen when hée chastizeth them, least they should vtterly faint by casting away all hope. And so it commeth too passe, that when Wheate is at a high price, the abundance of Wyne or Oyle chéereth them: and contra∣riwise.The contempt of the Gospell is punished with scarcitie of temporall oode. Neuerthelesse it is not done without good reason, that after the seducing by deceyuers and Heretikes, Iohn maketh mention of the scarcitie of temporall goods. For wyth suche manner of temporall plagues, is God woont too chastise hys people, for despysing the simplicitie and purenesse of the Gos∣pell, and for giuing eare too seducers. 7. And vvhen he had opened the fourthe Seale I heard the voyce of the fourth beast, saying, Come and see. 8. And I looked, and beholde a pale horse, and the name of him that sate vpon him vvas death: and Hell follovved him: and povver vvas giuen them ouer the fourth part of the earth, too kill vvith the svvorde, and vvith famine, and vvith death, and by the beastes of the earth. And when he had opened the fourthe seale. A. M. The opening of thys seale also perteyneth too the state of the Churche, the which God exerciseth sundrie wayes, that it maye depende vpon him alone. Come and see. This is expounded in the first verse.A description of Hypocrites And I looked, and beholde a pale horse. Vnder the shape of the pale horse, are descrybed the Hypocrites in whome there thriueth no power of the holy ghost, and in whom there appéereth no sparke of spirituall lyfe. G. For when Satan
hath once set vp his Kingdome by the cruell persecutions of Tyrantes, and false doctrine of deceyuers he indeuereth too stablishe the same by Hypocrites and counterfet Christians. And surely such peinted people do much harme to the Church bycause that whereas they be vtterly voyde of godlinesse, yet neuerthelesse they beare such a face of godlinesse to the world warde, that they can scarcely bée discerned from the deuoute and pure worshippers of God. Such were they which in the time of Christ dyd disfigure their faces that they might séeme vntoo men too haue fasted. Math. 6. b. 16. which prayed in the Lanes and open stréetes, that they myght deuour wydowes houses by long praying. Luke. 20 g. 47. which honoured God with their lippes onely, whereas their heart was all ye while farre from him. Math. 15. a. 8. And (too bée shorte) which dyd all thyngs too the intent too bée séene of men. Math. 23. a. 5. Of these kynde of men there hath alwayes béene great store in the worlde, and Christes faythfull Ministers haue suffered manie things at theyr handes. And the name of him that sate vpon him was Deathe.The liuely pat¦terne of the popish Vota∣ries & Cloy∣sterfolke. For as muche as the Hypocrites are voyde of the holie Ghost, it is thereby certeine, that they bee estraunged from the lyfe of God, and alwayes bounde vntoo death. Therefore althoughe suche men bée counted the ho∣lyest and ryghteousest of all men too the face of the worlde, in so much as they are not ashamed euen too set out parte of theyr holynesse too sale vntoo other men: (for they sell bothe their merites, and their prayers, and theyr fastings:) yet in verie déede they dwell in death, bycause there dwelleth in them no loue of God and theyr neyghbour. For they burne in the lustes of the flesh, which are accompanied wyth death: according as the Apostle sayth, if yée liue after ye flesh, yée shall dye, Roma. 8. c. 13. for lyke as a pale horse, although he haue a faint hew, doth neuer the more withhold himselfe from ye heate of lust to the mare. Euen so although hipocrites séeme holie outwardly in countenance, gesture, and appa∣rell: yet are they driuen no lesse wyth the lustes of the fleshe,
than suche as are not afrayde to doe the déedes of the fleshe openly. And therfore Chryste sayeth, that suche are lyke too whytelymed tumbs.What hell is, and to whome it is due. Mat. 23. c. 27. And hel followed him. The wages of sinne is death, after whiche followeth hell, that is to saye, the full measure of all miseries and tormentes. And this séemeth to bée added, to put the hypocrites in feare, that they may know for a certayntie, how that hell fyre is readie for them, except they amende betymes. Here vpon did Christ so often manace them Wo, wo, to the intent to shewe howe abhominable they were in the sight of God, albéeit that they were taken for Gods in the sight of men. And power was gi∣uen them ouer the fourth part of the earth, to kill. S. The old La∣tin translation writeth it, Ouer the foure partes of the earth. méening, East, south, west, and north. But the gréeke copies haue,The successe of hipocrisie & false doctrine. Ouer the fourth parte of the earth: in whiche maner of spéeche, the number certaine is put for a number infinite, whiche thing is founde ryfe in the Scriptures. Iohn then mée∣neth, that a great parte of men were corrupted with hypo∣crisie, and abondoned too innumerable miseries. M. For in all coastes and in all sectes there be some suche hipocrytes, who in these dayes as well as in Iohns tyme, doe kill some with the materiall sworde, some with hereticall persuasion, some with want of Euangelicall doctrine, some with their deadly example, and som with their beastly ministers, which sauour nothing but fleshly things. A. And all these things are befalne by the rightfull iustice of God.The cause why so many be led away by Hypocrites and false tea∣chers. For séeing that scarce the hundreth person of those to whom the Gospel is preached, indeuereth himselfe to frame his lyfe accordyng to the rule thereof: it is no wonder though many bée led away, partly by heretikes and partly by hipocrites. And truly wée sée that the greater parte of Christendome was vtterly seduced by those diuelish doctrines which Paul toucheth lightly. 1. Tim. 4. a. 1. for since the time that the tirannous law of single lyfe was crouded into the world, & the choice of meates receiued with so great consent, that men beleued the whole summe of
holinesse and Religion to consist therein: and also since the time that the lay men (as they tearmed them) were forbid∣den to reade the scriptures: no man can easly tell, how many Millions of soules haue miserably perished with the sword, and with famin, and with deathe, and by the beastes of the earth. Although all these things be layde vpon men by Gods right∣full iustice, for their hypocrisies sake:Calamities that come vpō the world, and the cause therof. yet notwithstanding Iohn séemeth in this place to repeate againe the thrée former afflictions, wherewith the Lord will punish the vnbeléefe of the world: according as it is writtē in Ezech. 14. d 21. Where∣vnto agrée the wordes of our Sauiour Christ: Nation (sayth he) shall rise against nation, and kingdome against kingdome, and in all places shall be great earthquakes, and pestilences and famin. &c. But first and formost they shall lay hands vp∣pon you, and persecute you. &c. Math. 24. a. 7.8.9. And thus he doth as it were adde the cause why suche calamities shoulde come vppon the world.The luste re∣ward of per∣secuters. All whiche things Iosephus in hys booke of the warres of the Iewes witnesseth to haue come to passe vppon the Iewish nation the mutherer of the prophetes and Apostles, yea and of the Lord himselfe, and the continu∣all striuer against al wholesome aduertisements. Neyther is it to bée doubted, but the Romayne Emperoures and their presidents that persecuted Christ, suffered the like: whiche thing will appéere manifestly vnto him that readeth the sto∣ries of the Emperoures.Nero. For when Nero vnderstood how the Senate had proclaymed him enemye, and condemned him to the Gibet, he slew himselfe.Domitian. Domitian was murthered by his owne chamberlaynes, as an effeminate and vprofitable persone.Maximine. Maximus and his sonne were killed by their owne souldiers at the seege of Aquileia.Decius. As Decius was fighting a battell in Mysia, he sunke into a quamyre perished, so as hys body was neuer séene after.Valerian. Valerian in making warre vppon the Persians, was taken prisoner by them, and made the Kyngs footestoole as oft as he tooke his horse backe. Aurelian was slayne by the conspiracie of a feaw men.Aurelian.
When DioclesianDioclesian. had resigned vp the Empire, he was tor∣mented with many and sundry diseases, and at length béeing out of his wittes, fordid himselfe with his owne hands at Ni∣comedia. Which things doubtlesse were done by the vengeance of God, whereas in the meane while diuers of the Apostles (through Gods mercifull protection) hilde out euen in the middes of persecutions, till they were crooked for age. Not∣withstanding yet by the way, it shall not be amisse (as I sayd afore) to vnderstande by this place, the fourthe state of the Church.Hermites and Monkes. For after Constantine had set the Church in peace, many men imbraced the lyfe of Hermits, who afterwarde degenerated into sundry sects of Monkery, by whome here∣sies were brought in against the wholesome and sounde doc∣trine of faith. For the redresse of which maladie, the Lorde stirred vp the Gothes and the Vandales the wasters of the world.The Gothes, Vandals and Sarzins. Afterward also in the necke of it, was brought in the sect of the Sarzins by Sergius the Moonke, the scholemaster of Mahumet in religion: by meanes whereof, the world hath bin vexed with innumerable mischéeues euen vnto this day. Wherefore all these sorowfull and hypocriticall sectes of Monks may aptly be vnderstoode by the pale horse, whome death and hell do folow.Mischiefe by Monks. Which thing is easy to be gathered, if we consider throughly how muche euill the Empyre of Rome hath sustayned by those kind of men in these latter times when the Benets, Eugenies, Sixts, and other Monks, and maisters of mischeuous heresie ruled the reynes of the Church, who haue outraged in the slaughter of the godly and giltlesse, no méeldlyer than a sort of cruell beastes. G. And e∣uen at this day still, ye may easly find many in Cloysters and Abbeys, which excéede euen the brute beastes in vnclennesse and filthinesse of lyfe: and yet in the meane while, the world wondereth and gazeth at them as the holiest of all men.
9. And vvhen he had opened the fifth Seale, I savv vnder an Altar the soules of them that vvere put too death for the vvord of God, and for the vvitnesse which theySome reade, hilde. had. And when he had opened the fifth seale. G. To the intent the faythfull should not eyther faint in trouble,They that dye for Christ ob∣teyne reward. or gyue credite to deceyuers, but rather be strengthned more and more in the doctrine of faythe: he sheweth that there is a plentifull rewarde layde vp for the patience of those, that haue taken vpon them the mayntenance of the truthe, with a stoute and stedfast courage euen vnto the deathe. For deathe doth not quench those quite, which shrinke not to die for Chrystes name sake: but they quietly wayte for the day of the resur∣rection, wherein they shall take their bodyes agayne, and be rewarded with euerlasting and most perfect felicitie. I saw vnder an Alter the soules of them that were put to death. O. P.The diuers taking of the word soule. The word Soule is put sometime for the lyfe, bycause the soule is the cause of lyfe, and bycause the lyfe consisteth in the soule, as in the. Psal. 119.109. & in Iob. 16. a. 4. Also it is takē for wil, mind, or desire, bycause it is the seate of the will and desire: in which sense the soule of Ionathas is sayde to be linked too the soule of Dauid. 1. Sam. 18. a. 1. and the soule of Sichem is sayde to haue cleaued to Dina the daughter of Iacob. Gen. 34.3.8. And Luke sayth that the multitude whyche beléeued were of one hart and one soule. Act. 4.32. Many tymes it is taken for a whole lyuing man: as when it is sayd, that thrée∣score and sixtéene soules went downe with Iacob into E∣gypt. Gene. 46.27. Also, the soule that sinneth, the same shall dye. Ezech. 18. e. 20. And the soule that steppeth aside to wit∣ches and soothsayers, shall dye the deathe. &c. Leuit. 20. a. 6. A. And againe, Eight soules were saued by water. 1. Peter. 3. d. 20. Sometimes it is taken for the breath whiche men doe breath in and out, wherein consisteth the liuely mouing of the body: like as when it is sayd, perplexitie hath caught hold
of me although my whole soule be still within me. 2. Samu. 1. b. 9. And, his soule is in him. Act. 20. b. 10. Also, let the soule of the child returne into his bowels. 3. Kings. 17. d. 21. And lyke as in Latin phrase of spéech, they be commonly wont to say, that the soule is puffed or breathed out: so also doth the scrip∣ture say, that the soule passeth or goeth out: as it is sayde of Rachell: And as hir soule was passing or going out, (for she was then dying) she called the child Ben-oni. Gen. 35. c. 18. But most often the word Soule is taken for the immortall spirite of man, like as when it is sayd, feare not them that kill the body, but cannot kill the soule Math. 10.28. In this sense doth Iohn say héere, that he saw the soules of them that were put too death.Altar or A∣brahams bo∣some. The soules vnder the Alter are all the godly from ye righteous Abel vnto Zacharie, according as Christe saythe. Mat. 23.35. And by the Altar we be put in mind of Abels Sa∣crifice, which he offered vnto God in fayth, for the which also God liked well of it: but he did not so of Caines sacrifise, and therefore Caine siue Abel. Gen. 4. b. 8. &. Hebr. 11. a. 4. &. 1. Iohn 3. b 12. This mans faith was followed of as many as haue bin made a sacrifice of swéete sent vnto God for his word, re∣posing their assured hope in the only sacrifise of Christ, wher∣of the said Abell was a figure. Therefore in this place, they are sayd to rest vnder the Altar, after the same manner that they bée sayd too rest in Abrahams bosome. Luke. 16. e. 22. For through faith, Abraham offered vp his own sonne for a burnt sacrifise, beleeuing that God was able to rayse hym vp euen from death. Hebr. 11. d. 17. And through this faith, as many as be the children of Abraham according to the promis, do hope for the resurrection by the true Isaac Christ, of whome the o∣ther Isaac was a figure. For the word of God. A. For the pro∣fession of Gods word is alwayes inseparably accompanyed with the Crosse:Beleefe and professiō must o togither. And for the witnesse which they had. M. That is to say, for the truthe of the euangelicall doctrine, whyche they haue witnessed with hart, mouth and woorke. For it is not ynough to haue the worde in ones hart, but he must also
professe it with his mouth. For the beléefe of the heart iusti∣fieth, and too knowledge with the mouth maketh a man safe. Rom. 10. b. 10. And in another place it is sayde: I beléeue, and therfore I haue spoken. Psal. 116. b. 10. &. 2. Cor. 4. c. 13. 10. And they cryed vvith a lovvde voyce, saying: Hovv long delayest thou O Lorde, vvho art holy and soothfast, too iudge and reuenge our bloud vpon them that dvvell in the earth? And they cryed with a loude voyce. S.Longing for Gods glory & kingdome. This crying and this loude voyce, betoken a desirousnesse of minde to haue Gods glory maynteyned, and wickednesse put quite away. Whiche thing they knowe the Lorde will doo: and yet in the meane while they pray for the iudgement with earnest sute accor∣ding to the Lords will, like as Dauid doth oftentimes in the Psalmes, and like as wée do also in our dayly prayers when wée say, Thy kingdome come. Math. 6. b. 10. Togither wher∣withall wée pray that Satans kingdome may be abolished out of hande, and the wicked with their abhominations cleane wyped out. Howe long delayest thou O Lorde, which arte holy and soothfast. A. Howe these titles bée peculiar vnto God, wée haue shewed afore. 3. b. 7. Too iudge and reuenge our bloud. M. In this petition is shewed the affection and desirousnesse,The longing of the godly to bee glorified with Christ. wherwith ye godly do long to be glorified with Christ in body and soule togither. For the soules of the godly enioy not full and perfect blessednesse immediatly after death, but they qui∣etly wayte for the restitution of all things, and for the resur∣rection of the fleshe, as wée doo: whiche restitution and resur∣rection, is the marke that all shoote at, as many as haue pligh∣ted their fayth vnto Christ. Vpon them that dwell in the earth? This parcell sheweth well inough, that this place muste bée vnderstoode of the soules that are loose from their bodies. For they speake in suche wise, as though they had no aliance any more with them that dwell vpon the earth.
11. And vnto ech of thē was giuen a single white robe: and it was sayd vnto thē, that they should rest yet a little vvhile, vntil their felow seruāts were filled vp, and their brethren which vvered to be slayne like as they had bin And vntoo eche of them was giuen a single whyte Robe. OP. By the single whyte Robe is betokened the beginning of glorie,The begin∣ning of glory in the elect that be depar∣ted. whiche God of his bounteousnesse bestoweth vpon the Mar∣tyrs, whyle the day of iudgemente is looked for. N. For the soules of the godly haue not yet the double robe of blessednesse: but they shall haue it after the iudgement, when euery one of the Sainctes shall bée made blessed on bothe halues, by the coupling agayne of the soule and body togither. Therefore as nowe they enioy the glory of Paradise with Christ, howbeit but in soule onely, according to this promise, This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise. Luke. 23. f. 43. Also, I desire to be let loose, and to be with Christ. Phil. 1. d. 23. In respect wher∣of,The soules of the chosen do∣rest in patiēce. there is added by and by. And it was sayd vnto them that they should rest. That is to wit, by wayting patiently for the day of the resurrection. Yet a little whyle. This is spoken after the manner of the Scripture, which promiseth in many places, that the tyme of miserie and trouble shall bée shortned to the electe. Esai. 54. b. 7.8. and. Dan. 11. d. 33. and. Math. 24. b. 22. and 2. Cor. 4. d. 17. and Hebr. 10. g. 37. and. 1. Peter. 1. a. 6. and .5. c. 10. Vntill their fellowe seruants were filled vp. Ergo, then the delay of vengeance, is made for the elects sake also. Héerevpon Pe∣ter sayth,Finall ven∣geance is de∣layed for the elects sake. The Lorde forsloweth not hys promise as some suppose: but he dealeth paciently for your sakes, willing that none should perishe, but that all shoulde turne to repentance. 2. Peter. 3. b. 9. B. And all these, whiche are tryed by the testi∣monie of fayth, haue not yet receyued their rewards, bicause God prouideth yet better for vs, namely that they shoulde not bée perfected without vs. Hebr. 11. g. 39. Also Moses sayth, The sinnes of the Amorrhites are not yet full. Gen. 15. c. 16. For which cause it behoued the lande of promise to be delayed. So also sayde Christ vnto the Pharisies, fill yée vp the mea∣sure
of your fathers. &c. Math. 23. d. 30. C. Then must the mea∣sure of the Reprobates bée filled, before Christ come to iudge∣ment, and to reuenge the bloudshed of his Martyrs.The continu∣all warfare of the godly. And theyr brethren which were to be slayne like as they had beene. Héere is giuen vs to vnderstande, that the chosen shall neuer be with∣out enimies vnto the worlds end. Wherfore there is cōtinual warre proclaymed agaynst them by the world and the diuell, but he that holdeth out to the ende shall be safe.The disproofe of such as hold opinion that ye the soules of men deceased sleepe till the day of iudge∣ment. Math. 10. c. 22. and. 24. b. 13. Now stādeth it vs in hand to disproue the errour of those that abuse this place of Iohns, to maynteyne that wicked opinion that mens soules sléepe, whiche hath growen strong in many places. Surely so little are they fauoured by this place, that it rather fighteth so manifestly agaynst their awke errour, as if it bée wayed well, it will bring it vnto right nought. First of all the Soules of dead men cry oute, yea and that with a loude voyce: which thing can not a∣grée too suche as are berefte of perceuerance. OP. Besides this, there bée gyuen them, not Fetherbeddes for them too lye downe and sléepe vpon: but whyte Robes whiche doo in no wyse agrée too sléeping. Néedes muste they then wake, which are so clothed. Whiche béeing true,What is re∣sembled by white robes. the whyte Robes muste without doubte (as I sayde) betoken the commencement of glory, which God of his bounteousnesse bestoweth vpon the Martyrs, vntill the day of iudgement come. For it is no noueltie in the Scriptures for a whyte Robe too resemble glory, mirth, and ioyfulnesse. For in a whyte garment was the Lorde séene of Daniell. 7. c. 9. In the same clothing the Lorde appeared in Mounte Thabor. Math. 17. a. 2. The An∣gell of the Lorde appeared to the women at his sepulchre in a whyte garment. Mark. 16. b. 5. In the same lykenesse the Angels appeared too the Disciples, when they gazed intoo heauen after the Lords ascention. Act. 1. b. 10. In the same ap∣parell was the Angell that appeared vnto Cornelius. Act. 10. e. 30. And the deliuerie of the beste long Robe vntoo the sonne that returned too hys father when hée had wasted all
his goodes, was a warrant of gladnesse and mirth. Luke. 15. . 22. Agayne if the soules of the dead cryed out (as the texte playnely sayth) then they slepte not. When then began they to be caste into this slumber? Let not any man obiecte vntoo vs that the bloud of Abell cryed out vnto God, Gen. 4. b. 10. and Heb. 11. a. 4. I confesse it is an ordinarie figure too make the matter it selfe too speake, and too make the sheading of the bloud to require vengeance. But in this place it is certayne, that the affection of the Martyrs is represented vnto vs by crying out, bicause their longing is expressed without any fi∣gure, and their demaunde set downe, howe long delayest thou O Lord to take vengeance.A double death and a double resurrection. &c. And therfore like as Iohn did set downe a double death héeretofore. 2. 11. so will he anone set downe a double resurrection, heereafter. 20. 6. That is too witte, the first, of the soule before the iudgement, and the other when the body shall bée raysed, and when the soule al∣so shall bee raysed vntoo glorie. Blessed are they (sayth he) which hath parte in the first resurrection: for in them the se∣conde death hath no place. Nothing therfore is more horrible than the authors of the sayd forgerie, which wil not acknow∣ledge the first resurrection, the which neuerthelesse is the only entrance into blessed glory. 12. And I savv vvhen he had opened the sixth seale, and behold there vvas made a great earthquake, and the Sunne became as black as sackcloth made of heare, and the whole Moone became as it were bloud. The gretnesse of gods wrath after cōtempte of his word.And I sawe when hee had opened the sixth seale. G. After the contempte of Gods worde there foloweth wrath and indig∣nation, to consume the aduersaries vtterly. And that shall bée so horrible, that the sunne also and the Moone, and the starres shall strike them in feare, by reason of the wonderfull alte∣ration that shal appeare in them. For so are the Prophets wōt to betokē the gretnesse of Gods wrath, & the horrible tribulati∣ons of ye wicked. For like as light chereth mēs harts, & maketh
them the better at ease: euen so by taking the lighte away, there is wonte too bée betokened very greate heauynesse. And beholde, there was made a greate earthquake.Horrible earth¦quakes. •. If yée take the worde Earthquake simply as it signifieth: euen Christe him selfe foretolde that many Earthquakes shoulde happen in dyuers places of the earth. Luke. 21.11. And (as hystories reporte) many Cities were turned vpside downe by them: among whiche first Nicomedia,Nicomedia & Nicea. and (a twelue yéeres after) Nicea a Citie of Bithynia, and within a while after that, many péeces of the Citie GermaGerma. whiche standeth in Helles∣ponte, were destroyed, as it appeareth in the tripartite Sto∣rie. Lib. 7. Capi. 15. &. 22. Moreouer Laodicea, Hieraple,Laodicea, Hie¦raple, Coloss. and Colossus in Asia, were sore shaken, and in a manner vtterly ouerthrowen with a great earthquake about the ende of the reigne of Nero. In the reigne of Traiane, the earth was shaken so horribly, that mountaynes were rent asunderMountaynes rent a sunder. and sunken. Furthermore many Cities were shaken, almost to their vtter vndooing: but most of all Antioche,Antioche. where a great number of people perished with the fall of houses. About the latter ende of Lucius Bishop of Rome, there was as horri∣ble an Earthquake in Syria,In Syria. as euer was any afore: and at that time the moste parte of Antioche, Tripolie, and Da∣mascoAntioche, Tri¦poli, and Da∣masco. fell downe. Besides this, the Citie CatanaCatana. in Sicilie was muche more fowlly torne, and fyue and twentie thou∣sande people were ouerwhelmed with the fall of it. In the time that Boniface the eyght was Bishop, there was as hor∣rible an Earthquake as euer was any since men coulde re∣member: the trembling whereof continued many dayes to∣gither, whereby many and great buyldings were ouerthro∣wen euery where:Boniface the viij. Bishop of Rome. and Boniface him selfe lying then at Rheate, kepte house in the open fieldes, for feare least the houses should haue falne vpon him. Thus muche out of the Enneades of Sabellicus. A lyke Earthquake happened in Germanie aboute the yéere of our Lorde.Basil and Straughsbo∣rowe. 1356. whereby almost al Basil was cast downe. And the men of Straughs∣borowe
running out of the Citie, kepte them selues in the o∣pen fieldes for béeing ouerwhelmed with the fall of houses, whyle the earth did quake many dayes togither. M. Besides this,An vniuersall earthquake of the whole earth. in the yere of our Lorde. 1382. there was an earthquake beyonde all measure monstrous: for the whole earth shooke all at once, which is a thing contrarie to nature, and aboue al the reasons of naturall Philosophie.Horrible tu∣mults for the alteration of religion. S. Howbeit for as muche as Earthquakes do in the Scriptures oftentimes betoken the alterations of things that are to bée altered, whether it bée of Kingdomes or of Religion, which can not bee doone without great turmoyles: this place may bée vnderstoode of the huge, horrible, and incredible alterations, as well of the Empire, as of Religion, by reason whereof horrible slaughters should bée made welnéere through the whole world. For wée know how many and how great tragedies haue béene stirred vp by the Heretikes the forerunners of Antichrist. First ArriusArius. whose heresie was a certayne season fauoured by Liberius Bishop of Rome. Also ConstanceConstance. the syster of Constantine the Em∣perour béeing infected with the same heresie, obteyned at length, that Arrius should bée called home from banishment, and heard to speake. Also the Emperours Constantius and Valens,Constant and Valens. fauouring this wicked Heretike, persecuted the right beléeuers, and made great slaughters of Martyrs. That he∣resie lasted more than a hundred yéeres, troubling the Chur∣ches, not onely of the East, but also of the West. And yet by the way wée wyll omit the braynesicke and detestable here∣sies of Sabellius,Diuers He∣retikes. Manicheus, Marcian, Fotinus, Paulus Samosetanus, Nestorius, Nouatus, Valentinus, Diodo∣rus, Apollinaris, Pelagius, and many others, whereby the Churches were pitifully torne through the whole world. For the taking away and chastizing of whome, doubtlesse Iulian the wicked Apostata was sent: who began to assault all the Christians in generall. Afterwarde came the Scithians, Hunes, Gothes, Vandales, and Alanes,The Scithiās Hunes, Go∣thes, Van∣dales, and lane. barbarous nations: who making many cruel slaughters, did miserably wast and
spoyle, first a great parte of the East, and afterward welnéere the whole west, by the space of more than a hundred and thrée∣score yéeres. Wherevpon the Stories reporte, that AlarikeAlarike. king of the Gothes, was wonte too say, hée was enforced whether he woulde or no, to conquere the Empire of Rome: and lykewyse that Attyla was wonte too call him selfe the scourge of God. Moreouer,Attica. were not those great Earthqua∣kes, when first of all the Ismaelites (whiche serued in wages vnder the Emperour Heraclius) tooke Mahumet a souldiour of his, and making him the head of their faction,Mahumets vnhappie suc∣cesse in wic∣kednesse. rebelled a∣gaynst their master in his owne Campe? The which Mahu∣met hauing good lucke in two or thrée battels, and so béeing in∣creased in strengthe, alyed vnto him the Persians agaynst Heraclius. Afterwarde béeing instructed by Sergius the Monke, a teacher of the Heresie of Nestorius, hee wrate Lawes whereby hée wanne men vnto hym of all Sectes, and wroughte no small decay vnto the Christian fayth, vn∣tyll nowe at length (after almoste a thousande yéeres con∣tinuance) he is growen so puissant, that hée subdueth what Countreys hée lysteth too hys Empire by force of armes. And is not this also to bée counted a greate Earthquake,The vsurped supremacie of the Bishops of Rome. when the Bishop of Rome hauing purchased of the Empe∣rour Phocas the supremacie ouer all Churches in the world, first led away all the West part from the Emperours obedi∣ence, making Charles surnamed the Great, the French king, Emperour of Rome, whom also he helde subiect to him as his vnderling? And afterwarde turning all the West part from Christes Gospell, and from the doctrine of the Apostles, compelled them to his owne opinions and decrées by violence and sworde? Who doubteth then but that suche altera∣tions of common Weales and of Religion, are oftentymes in the Scriptures bothe foretokened and signified by Earth∣quakes? Which thing euen our times declare to be vtterly moste true. For howe greate slaughters of men haue wée séene alate in Germanie, A. Englande, and Fraunce,
since men began to consult of abolishing Papistrie, and of set∣ting vp Christianitie agayne? S. And no doubt but there wyll followe many mo, assoone as other Nations shall attempt too caste off the yoke of Antichriste, and too giue them selues too substantiall godlynesse. And the Sunne became blacke as a sackeclothe made of heare.The darkning of the Gospell by Antichrist, and Christes victory against him. By suche manner of surmounting comparisons as well the Prophetes Esai. 13. d. 10. and Ezech. 32. b. 7.8. and Ioel. 2. b. 10. as also the Euangelistes, Math. 24. c. 29. and Luke. 21. e. 25. foretell righte great calamities that shall ensue vpon mankinde. And séeing it is inoughe and more than inough knowen, that the last persecution of Anti∣christe shall (by the testimonie of the Scriptures) bée the gre∣uousest of all others, not onely outwardly in the body, but also inwardly: as whereby fayth and innocencie are im∣peached: it followeth also that Chrystes victorie shall bée moste glorious agaynst hym. Therefore not amisse doo wée take the darkening of the Sunne, too bée the fayling of the simple and pure doctrine of Christe, by the thry∣uing or rather reygnyng of Antichrystes abhominations throughe all Churches: according too this saying: when the sonne of man commeth, thinke you that hée shall fynde fayth vpon the earth? Luke. 18. b. 8. So also is the heate of Charitie nowe become colde. But the sunne shall then bée darkened vnto them, when Christ shall execute his full force vpon them by destroying them miserably.A terrible E∣clips of the sunne. But if any man like to vnderstande it of the visible Sunne: there was scarce euer séene a greater Eclips of it since the Passion of Christ, than that was whiche happened the same yéere that the Po∣pishe Croysie was first set vp and put in execution. And the whole Moone became as it were bloud. As well by the blouddi∣nesse of the Moone, as also by the foresayde darkening of the Sunne, Iohn ment to expresse nothing else, but that whither soeuer men turne their eyes, many things shal appeare euery where both aboue & beneath, to strike them in feare. For it is all one as if he had sayd, Thyngs neuer went so wretchedly
in this world, nor there neuer appéered so many and so great signes of Gods wrath. But héere it is demaunded,An obiection with an an∣swere why so great plagues should followe the Gospel. howe it may agrée that so huge a sea of inconueniences should flowe out togither with the manifestation of Christ. For it may séeme against reason, that wheras hée is the onely pledge of Gods loue towards mankynd, in whom the heauenly father layeth foorth all the treasures of his goodnesse, or rather in whom hée powreth out the bowelles of his mercie vpon vs: yet notwithstāding Gods wrath burneth more fiercely since his comming than it did before, so as it catcheth hold both of heauen and earth as it were with one flame at once. First it is to be considered, that for asmuch as men are ouerflowen in receyuing Christ, they must bée quickened vp with diuers af∣flictions as it were with squorges. Secondly wheras Christ calleth them vnto him that be distressed and heauy loden with miseries, we cannot learne that lowlynesse, till we be tamed with manie miseries. For through the prosperous state of their affaires, men take stout and proud stomacks vnto them, and it cannot be but that he which wéeneth himselfe to be well at ease, will presumpteously despise Christ. Thirdly, by∣cause we be ouerforeward in séeking the ease of the fleshe, wherevpon it comes to passe, that many men tye the grace of Christ to this present lyfe: it is for our behoofe to be inured too the contrarie opinion, to the end we may know that Christs kingdome is spiritual. And therefore God of purpose to teach vs that Christs goodes are heauenly, exercyseth vs with ma∣ny troubles as touching the flesh. Wherby it commeth to passe that we séeke our happinesse out of the worlde. Also the vn∣thankfulnesse of men increaseth the heape of miseries. For the seruant that knoweth his masters wil and doeth it not, is worthy of sorer punishment. Luke. 12. f. 47. The more famili∣arly that God dealeth with vs in Christ, the more dothe our vnkindnesse increase & burst out into open stubbornesse. So is it no maruell at all though many signes of Gods venge∣ance appéere at the open preaching of Christ, considering that
men on their behalfe, do by their wicked contempte prouoke God the more gréeuously, and set his wrath the more on fire against them. And therefore whereas Iohn sayth, that the sonne shall become blacke and the Moone bluddy: they be figu∣ratiue spéeches,Figuratiue speeches. wherby he méeneth, that the Lord shall shewe foorth such signes of his wrath through the whole frame of the world, as shal set men beside their wits for feare, as though the whole order of nature shoulde horribly turne topsiteruie. For lyke as the Sunne and the Moone are witnesses of Gods fatherly loue towards vs, when they yéeld lyght to the earth in these turnes: so on the contrary part, he sayth they shall bée messengers of Gods wrath and sore displeasure. According also as Christ himselfe warneth vs more fully in Math. 24. c. 29. & in Luke. 21. e. 25. 13. And the Starres fell from heauen vpon the earth; like as the figge tree casteth his greene figges vvhen it is shaken of a great vvind. Stars falling from heauen, or teachers falling from soūd doctrine.And the starres fell from heauen. O. By the name of Starres are commonly meant the ministers and teachers of the word as is said afore. 1. d. 16. 20. B. They are sayd to fal from heauen, when they forsake the heauenly doctrine, and imbrace and teach mens traditions. S. Which thing hath come to passe vn∣der the reuolting of Mahumet and the bishop of Rome. For in a manner all of them are stept out of the way, and are be∣come vnprofitable Of these and such like the Apostle spake aforehand saying: The time will come that men shall not a∣way with sound doctrine: but they whose eares itch shall get them a heape of teachers after their owne lusts. 2. Timo. 4. a. 3. Also, if any man teach otherwise, and consent not to the wholsome sayings of our Lorde Iesus Christ, and to the doc∣trine which is according vnto godlynesse, he is puft vp and knoweth nothing, but wasteth his braynes about questions and quarellings of words, wherof spring enuie, strife, blas∣phemie, euill surmisings, and vayne disputations of men of
corrupt minds, and which are destitute of the truth, thinking lucre to be godlinesse. 1. Tim. 6. a. 3.4.Vnsetled pro∣fessors of the Gospell. A. Also sée Acts. 20. f. 29. & 1. Iohn. 2. c. 18 Like as the figge tree casteth his. &c. A. It is a fit comparison. For euen so do they fall in time of temptation, as many as haue not the word of faith fastned and rooted in their harts, but stand brabling like old doting wiues aboute outward things and Ceremonies. M. And like as if a man should fall from aloft, no man ought to thinke it straunge though he were broken and battered all to péeces: Euen so if the teachers and scholemasters of Christendome fal from the heigth of so great a profession as theirs is, what maruell is it if they hardly or neuer come to rising vp agayne. 14. And the heauen vvent avvay as a booke that is rolled about: And al hilles and Ilands vvere moued out of their places. And the heauen wēt away. A. The old latin translation hath,What is ment by rolling vp of the hdauen. As a skroll that is wrapped in, that is to say, as a skrol yt is rolled & wrapt vp togither. I. The same saying is in ye psalmes of ye alteration of the heauēs. Psa. 102. d. 23. To suche as be in ex∣treme miserie, ye heauen seemeth to fal downe, to be rolled vp togither, & to vanish away. So also whē heretikes and errors of Antichrist preuayle on al sides, ye Church of Christ séemeth vtterly to go to wreck: like as vnder the wicked Achab & Ie∣zabell, it seemed that there were no mo true worshippers of God left but only Elias. 3. Kings. 19. b. 10. & Ro. 11. a. 3. A. And in our dayes also ye Church semed to haue bin fordone, when one mā or twayne were fain to wrestle against ye whole world, & that, not without great peril of their liues. For there was so great blindnesse and ignorance in the world, that scarcely one man among many thousands, did throughly vnderstand the office of Christ, (which notwithstanding is the chéefe poynt of Christian religion,) that is to wit, to iustify men fréely, that is to say without any respect of their workes. And all hilles and Ilands were moued out of their places. S. Thys may be referred
to the Earthquake whereof mention is made in the twelfth verse.The wonder∣ful preuayling of Antichrist in his errors. By the way, it signifyeth, that the froward and forged doctrine shall in all ages beare suche sway in the Churche, that euen the hilles (that is to say the learned, and suche as were as stedy and vnmouable as mountaines, in the doctrine of Christ,) should giue place to the heretikes. So also the I∣lands, that is to say, such as were counted so stedfast in the fayth, that they would no more giue place vnto errors, than Ilandes yéeld to the waues of the sea: should not be able to a∣bide by their tackling, so gréeuous and sore in all respectes should the temptation be. And truly mens traditions haue growen so strong, by burying the doctrine of the Gospell vn∣der the reigne of Antichrist, that no Realme, nor Citie, nor Village, nor finally no house was frée from pestilents errors. 15. And the kings of the earth, the princes, rich mē, and Captaynes, and the mightie men, and euery bond∣man, and freeman, hid themselues in dennes and in the Rockes of mountaynes. The greuous∣nesse of Gods vengeance agaynst the despisers of his worde.And the kings of the earth, the princes. &c. A. He amplifyeth the greatnesse of Gods wrath which shall be powred out vp∣pon the enimies of the truthe and the persecutors of the Church. P. The kings of the earth are the men of might, who thinke thēselues to be out of danger. A. Bicause they ouerpéere al other mē. Princes & rich mē trust to their riches & authori∣tie, passing little or nothing for the word of the Lord. And the residew of men do carelesly despise al things that make to the setting foorth of Gods glory. But the time will come, that all of them shal feele the heauy hand of God, and at length suffer endlesse punishment. Hid themselues in dennes. &c. Verely to séeke couert that they may shun the wrath of the righteous iudge: howbeit in vayne. For of al things it is most rightfull, that such as wold not acknowledge and receiue the Sauioure sent vnto them by God, should feele him a sore and iust iudge.
16. And saide vnto the Hilles and Rockes, fall vpon vs, and hyde vs from the face of him that sitteth vpon the throne, and from the vvrath of the Lambe. And sayd vnto the. So also sayd Christ to the multitude of people and women that followed him towarde his passion:The anguishe of the repro∣bates at gods sodeine ven∣geance. Then shall they begin too saye too the mountaines, fall vpon vs: and too the Hils, couer vs, Luke. 23. d. 30. And this is said, partly too put the proude and stubborne harted in feare, and partly too prouoke them too amendment, and partly also too strengthen the minds of the godly against the ouergreat wil∣fulnesse of the world. For the carelesnesse of ye wicked wher∣through they seeme too mocke at God, is no small occasion of stumbling. Ageine nothing is more readie with vs, than too bee caught by the inticementes of the prosperous Fortune which they inioy, so as the awe of God slippeth quite & cleane from vs. Therefore too the end that the faithfull shoulde not spight their drunken mirth: Iohn sayth that the same shall bee turned into sorow and anguishe of mind, by reason of the intollerable vengeance that shall light vpon them, when he whom they now despyse and persecute shall come exceedyng terribly vntoo iudgemente with passing power and glorie. From the face of him that sitteth. &c.The counte∣nance of God is terrible too the wicked. I. It is an expressing of God by a further circumstance. Héere we sée it is the nature of euill men, alwayes too shunne Gods face, bicause it looketh not chéerely vpon them, as it doth vpon the Electe, and vpon his deuout worshippers: according as Dauid witnesseth in these wordes: The eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous, and his eares are open vnto their prayers, but the counte∣nance of the Lord is against them that do euill. &c. Psal. 34. c. 16. And from the wrath of the Lambe.The wrath of the Lamb. Then is not Christ too be despysed by reason of the excéeding great méekenesse that abideth in him. He is a Lambe in déede, howbeit but too the godly, but to the chosen, but to such as feare God: toward the reprobates and the despisers of God, he putteth vpon him the
countenance of a Lyon, too put them in feare and too destroy them. Furthermore Iohn maketh mention of the Lambes wrath by name, to the ende we might knowe, that the power of iudging is bestowed by God vpō Christ as he is man. For too this ende did Christ die and rise ageine: namely that he myght bée Lord of the quicke and the dead. Rom. 14. b. 9. Also, he hath gyuen him power too doo Iustice bycause he is the son of man. Iohn. 5. e. 27. And ageine, God hath ordeined him too bée iudge both of the quicke and the dead. Act. 10. g. 42. Looke also in Math. 25. e. 31. and in. 2. Thess. 1. c. 7.8.9.10. 17. For that great day of his vvrath is come, & vvho shall be able to stand? Domesday both terrible and ioyfull.For that great day of his. &c. A. The day of iudgement is ter∣med so in respecte of the vngodly. For vntoo the children of God, this day shall bée a daye of redemption, a day of mirth, a day of rewarding: but too the reprobates, it shall bée a day of anger, wrath, and vengeance, as it is written in Esai. 63. a. 1. and Sophonie.The state of the godly and of the vngodly at domesday. 1. d. 15. and Luke. 4. c. 19. And who shall bee able too stande? The vngodly acknowledge (though all too late) that God is a consumyng fyre, Deut. 4. d. 24. and Hebre. 12. g. 29 and howe terrible a thing it is too fall intoo his handes, Hebre. 10. f. 31. And what tormenteth them more than the continuall gnawing of their euill conscience? contrariwyse the godly trusting too the rightuousnesse and innocencie of Christ, come foorth too méete Christ holdyng their heades vp∣right, well assured of the saluation which they haue hoped for by the free fauour of God, accordyng as Iohn saythe: déere∣ly beloued, if our owne harte condemne: vs not, then haue wée assurance too Godwarde, and whatsoeuer wée aske wée shall receyue of hym, bycause wée kéepe his commaunde∣mentes, and doo the things that bée acceptable in his sight, 1. Iohn. 3. d. 21.22. And ageine, héerein is perfecte charitie with vs, that wée maye haue truste in the day of iudgement: for lyke as he is, so are wée also in thys worlde. 1. Iohn. 4. d. 17.
Whervnto perteineth this saying of Christe to his disciples: when these things begin to come to passe, looke yée vp and lift vp your handes, for your redemption draweth nie. Luke. 21. f. 28. Wherefore like as this dreadfull description of Gods iudgement, is greatly auaylable too put the wicked in feare, which follow the lustes of the fleshe carelesly: so must it bée a ground of singular comfort vnto all the godly. For they can not feare him as a iudge that should bée against them, whom they haue by faith imbraced as their Mediator, Aduocate, and most déere brother. The seuenth Chapter. AFter this I savve foure Angells standing vpon the foure corners of the earth, holding the foure vvinds of the earth, that the vvynd should not blovv vpon the earth, not vpon the sea, nor vpon any tree. AFter this I sawe.The Churche is stablished & increased by persecutions. A. This chapter conteineth an excellent good lesson. For it teacheth vs, that Christes kingdome is not destroyed but ra∣ther stablished among men by persecutions. Truly Satan with all his ministers, yt is too wit, Tyrants, persecuters, Heretikes, decei∣uers and Hipocrites bestirre them: and of all them wyth one consent indeuer too ouerthrowe Christes Churche, and too oppresse it vtterly. But theyr deuyses are too no purpose, in as muche as the welfare of the godly is grounded vppon a most sure Rocke. Therefore in this vision (which yet still perteyneth too the sixth seale) Iohn setteth downe two things that make greatly to the comforte of the godly. S. For firste he sheweth, that the aduersaryes power is not able to hurt so much as hys harte woulde serue him too doo, bycause Chryst our sauiour will not suffer him. And secondly yt notwithstan∣ding the wylinesse of Satā, who tries al the wayes to ye wood
too make a cleane riddance of Christes kingdome: yet shall an excéeding great and innumerable multitude bée registred in∣too Christes kingdome out of the whole worlde. A. For Gods foundation standeth sounde, hauing this Seale, the Lorde knoweth who bée his. 2. Tim. 2. c. 19. And none of the chosen can perishe. Iohn. 6. d. 39. and. 10. e. 28. & .17. b. 12. Foure Angells standing.The working of euil spirits to bring the Gospell in ha∣tred and con∣tempt. S. The scripture witnesseth that manie euils are done in the world by the working of wicked Angells, not without Gods sufferance. So reade we that Eue was seduced by the wicked féend, Gene. 3. a. 4. that Iob the holy seruaunt of God was afflicted with manye mischeues. Iob. 1. c. 14.15.16.17.18. That Pharaos wizardes resisted Moses and Aharon by the seruice of diuels, Exod. 7. b. 11. That Satan withstood Iosua ye high Priest in the building vp agein, both of the Temple and of ye citie of Ierusalem. Zachar. 3. a. 1. Besides this, our Lord himselfe was tempted by the diuell with sundrie incounters Math. 4. a. 1. and Marke. 1. b. 13. Ageinst whom also he stirreth vp the traitour Iudas, Luke. 22. a. 3. and Iohn. 13. c. 27. Sainct Paule also warneth vs that Satā, (too deceiue vs vnwares) is wonte to transforme himselfe into an Angell of light. 2. Cor. 11. d. 14. And that our wrestling is not against fleshe and bloud, but against the Princes and powers of darkenesse. &c. Ephe. 6. b. 12. Yea and Saint Peter biddeth vs bée sober and watchfull, that the diuell who pursueth vs like a cruel Lyon, swalowe vs not vp whole. 1. Petr. 5. c. 8. These and manye o∣ther things of the same sort doth the scripture auouch concer∣ning the mischéeuousnesse of wicked feendes against such as haue halowed themselues vnto Christ. And in ye ende, Christ our sauiour fathereth both lying, and man slaughter, and all kind of mischéefe vpon them as the authors thereof. Iohn. 8. f. 44. Wherfore I take this place to bée ment of euil Angels, by whose working it commeth too passe, that the Princes and wise men of the worlde doo hinder the wholsome course of preaching the Gospell, which thing the féends doo procure by wonderfull meanes: that is to wit, either when the weather
is vnseasonable and so the earth becōmeth barren, or when riuers breake their bankes and ouerflowe, or when there fo∣loweth a murrein bothe of man and beaste, or when there hath béene ill successe in battell againste the enemie: they wreste all these things too make the cace of the Christians heynous, vpon whose religion, the Priests of the Idols (who from time to time prouoked both the Princes and the people too persecute the Christians) wyted the myseries of all times vpon the neglecting of the seruice of the Gods: according as it is too bée séene in the Ecclesiasticall historie of Eusebius, and in Tertullian in hys Apologie. Holdyng the foure wynds.Antichrist hin¦dereth ye prea∣ching of the Gospell. O. That is too saye, by all meanes hindering the preaching of the Gospell which is woont too bée done by the operation of the holy Ghost, who is called a wynde. And although that he which is betokened in this place, bée but one single Spirite: Yet doth Iohn recken vp foure, bycause the power of the holy Ghost is shed abroade through the whole world. M Moreouer the diuel knoweth wel ynough, that nothing is more ageinst his Kingdome than the preaching of the Gospell: D. and ther∣fore he laboreth to holde it backe in all places, as much as he can, least men should beléeue and be saued. M. Which thing no man can now doubt to be fulsilled, considering how the Po∣pishe prelates bend themselues with might & maine, to kéepe short all true preachers of the Gospell. That the wynd shoulde not blowe vpon the earth.A comparing of ye preaching of the Gospell to the wind. For lyke as the wynde raiseth vp cloudes, openeth the earth, moysteth it, maketh it fruitefull, and maketh it looke chéerefully with flowers and fruits: euen so the preaching of the Gospel shadoweth the hartes of earth∣ly mē, and preserueth them from the wickednesse of heresie, & openeth them vnto repentantnesse, & maketh way through them that they may receiue grace, and maketh them to bring forthe the fruite of good woorkes, and beautifyeth them with good examples. But nowe is thys blast (of all blastes the pleasantest) by Satans suttletie and naughtinesse forbyd∣den too blowe vpon the earthe. Nor vpon the Sea, nor vpon any
tree.This appea∣reth in that the Pope for∣biddeth all sortes of men to reade the Scriptures in the mother toung. S. There bée, which by the earth do vnderstand the com∣mon sort of mē and simple folkes: by the sea, rich marchant∣men which traffike vpon the seas: and by Trees, the better sort which by reason of som worthinesse or dignitie, are more estéemed than others and beare greater preeminence among men: or else such as being erst hild vp by the doctrine of the Gospell, were readie too bring forthe the fruites of faith and godlynesse in their workes. S. So as wée may vnderstand, that this doctrine is forbidden from all kind of men, of what state or degrée so euer they bee, too the intent the knowledge of the truthe shoulde not come too any manner of men. Which thing, the publike decrées with forfeitures and penalties an∣nexed, as well of those tymes as of oure dayes, doo auouche. O. But like as nothing can stop the natural course of ye wind: so can no man lyghtly withstande the preaching of the Gos∣pell, but that it must come too them for whom it is ordeyned, that vntoo some it may bée the sauour of lyfe vntoo lyfe, and vnto othersome the sauour of death vntoo death. 2. Cor. 2. d. 16. 2. And I savve another Angell comming vp from the rysing of the Sunne, hauing the Seale of the lyuing God. And he cryed vvith a loude voyce too the foure Angells vntoo vvhom it vvas giuen too hurt the Land and the Sea. And I saw another Angell. G. This Angel betokeneth Christ, who is also called the Angell of the couenant by the Prophet Malachie. 3. a. 1. A. He is sayde too come vp from the rysing of the Sunne, bycause he is sente vntoo vs from the heauenly father, accordyng as he himselfe witnesseth, saying: I went oute from the Father and am come intoo the world, Iohn. 16. d. 28. And Zacharie the Father of Iohn Baptist calleth hym the day spring or Ryzer from an hygh, Luke. 1. g. 78. Hauyng the seale of the lyuing God.Who haue the seale of the li∣uing God. This is truely verefyed of Christ, who is the image of God whiche is inuincible Coloss. 1. b. 15.
the brightnesse of his glorie, and the expresse image of hys substance, Hebre. 1. a. 3. Whom God the father hathe sealed, Iohn. 6. c. 27. Vntoo whome all power is giuen both in hea∣uen and earthe. Math. 28. d. 18. and too bée shorte, in whome dwelleth the fulnesse of the Godheade bodily. Colo. 2. b. 9. S. In déede those bad Angells woulde haue letted, that the truthe of the Gospell myghte not haue come too all manner of men: but they coulde not, bycause Christ commaunded the Gos∣pell too bee preached vnto all creatures, Marke. 16. c. 15. ac∣cording too that which he had sayde, Nowe is the iudgement of this worlde, nowe shall the Prince of thys world bée cast oute. Iohn. 12. e. 31. And, bée of good chéere, I haue ouercome the worlde. Iohn. 16. d. 33. Notwithstandyng there bee which by thys Angell, doe vnderstande all faithfull Ministers of Gods word, who being sent of God, are armed with the word of faithe, (which is ryghtly lykened too the Seale of the ly∣uing God,) and stoutly wythstande those bad Angels that woulde stoppe the course of the Gospell. Whiche sense a∣gréeth not amisse, so wée alwayes beare in mynde, that whomsoeuer Christ vseth as his Ministers in thys behalfe, yet is the thing doone by the benefyte of Christ hymselfe. And he cryed wyth a loud voyce to the foure Angells.Christs voyce is loude. M. So great is Christes power, that euen the Diuells (and much more the euill men) are at hys commaundement and bounde too obedience vntoo hym: which thing he made manifest euen when he lyued vpon earth, Math. 8. d. 28. and Marke. 1. c. 25. and Luke. 4. f. 36. S. Nay rather he excelleth so farre in power and authoritie, as well of Godhead as of manhood, that all thyngs as well in Heauen as in Earthe, are fayne of ne∣cessitie too obey hys voyce. And hys voyce is sayde too bée loude, bycause that euen suche as are farre of from hym doo héere it, yea and also tremble at it, neyther dare they by anye meanes resiste it. Héerevntoo perteyne the thyngs which Christ disputeth concerning his shéepe, Iohn. 10. c. 16. & whiche Paule. wryteth concerning the predestination of the
Saincts.Satan & his members can hurt no man without gods leaue. Rom. 8. f. 30, Vnto whom it was giuen. That is to say, they had leaue of God. For Satan could not do men any dis∣pleasure at all, if he had not leaue gyuen him by the rightfull Iustice of God, according as I haue saide heretofore, 2. c. 10. Too hurt the land and the sea. A. It is too bée marked héere, that there can no greater harme bée wrought vnto men,The greatest hurte that can happen vnto man. than too bée bereft of the knowledge of the truth, or of the preaching of the Gospell. For what can be loked for but vtter damnation, when the worde of saluation is taken away? what can bée looked for but darknesse, whē light is quenched? finally what can be loked for but death, whē the message of life is reiected? Therfore it was a most greuous Manace which Christ fore∣told to the thanklesse Iewes, when he said, The kingdome of God shall be taken from you, and giuen to a nation that shall bring forth the fruits of it. Mat. 21. d. 43. And Paule saith, It behoued the worde of God to bée preached first vnto you: but forasmuch as you put it from you. &c. Act. 13. g. 46. 3. Saying, hurte not the earth, nor the Sea, nor the Trees, vntill vve seale the seruauntes of our God in the foreheades. Satan can do no harme without leaue of God.Saying, hurt not. S. Satan durst not hurt holie Iob, neyther in outward goods, nor in bodie, till he had gotten leaue of God. Iob. 1. c. 12. And although the Gergesenes were euill men: yet durst not the féend enter into their swyne, but at Christs com∣maundment. Math. 8. d. 31. Yea and most true it is whiche Christ sayth, that not so much as a little sparow lighteth vp∣on the ground, if the heauenly father list not. Math. 10. c. 29. How much lesse then can Satā or the world by any meanes hurt the Children of God?The three persons of the Godhead are vnseparable in working. Vntill wee seale. A. He vseth ye plu∣rall number to comprehend within him the father, and the holy Ghost, who worketh in the elect: lyke as when he saith, If any man loue mée and kéepe my sayings, my father also will loue him, and we will come vnto him, and make our a∣bode
with him, Iohn. 14. c. 23. The seruauntes of our God.The seale of God, & who be sealed ther∣withall. That is too say the chosen, and the deuout worshippers of God. In the foreheads. S. Héere séemeth to be an allusion too the myste∣rie of the golden plate vpon the forehead of the high Priest, wherin was ingrauen the name of the Lorde, Exod. 28. f. 38. And moreouer too the bloud of the Lamb, wherwith ye postes of Gods people were marked, that they might be safe frō the Angell that destroyed, Exo. 12. b. 13. and also to the signe Tau, in Ezec. 9. b. 4. Moreouer they be sealed, as many as are mar∣ked with Christes spirit in their hartes, & who through sted∣fast faithe and vtter renouncing of themselues, are not asha∣med too professe Christes name vnfearfully both in confesson of mouth, and also in behauiour of lyfe and conuersation, be∣fore this forlorne and sinfull world. A. For the beléefe of the hart iustifyeth, and the confession of the mouth maketh a mā safe. Rom. 10. b. 10. Then let our false Nicodemusses sée by what reason they may glory, that they are sealed wyth thys holy seale of faith, seeing that in their outwarde ceremonies they fauour the seruice of Idols. 4. And I herde the number of those that vvere sea∣led. A hundred and foure and fortie thousande vvere sealed oute of all the Trybes of the Children of Israell. And I herd the number of them that were Sealed.Nothing can disappoynt the sealing of gods elect. G. This place giueth great matter of comforte vntoo all the godly. For it sheweth that the wylinesse, strength, and power of Sathan can not let, but that the Children of God shall bée sealed with the seale of the holie Ghost, too the intent they may alwayes bée frée, as well from the deceytes of errours, as from the pu∣nishmentes which linger for all vnbeléeuers.The number of Twelue is sacred and re∣nowmed in the holy scrip∣tures. A hundred and foure and fortie thousande. G. Heere is a number certaine put for a number infinite. S. For héere is betokened the innume∣rable multitude of the chosen. For the number of twelue is a number of most fulsome vniuersalnesse, if it bée repeted
according too the reckening of auditors and casters of accoūt. For twelue being multiplyed in it self by ten, maketh a hun∣dred and twentie: which being multiplyed ageine by tenne, make twelue thousand: & these being multiplyed by twelue amount too a hundred fortie and foure thousand. M. And there∣fore this number of twelue is sacred and renoumed in the Scriptures and in the workes of God, as wherby Christ be∣tokened the restitution of the Church too come, Math. 10. a. 1. for like as the people of Israell descended of the twelue Pa∣triarkes: euen so Christ called backe the scattered remnants of them too the rememberance of theyr originall, by choosing twelue Disciples, too ye end they should conceiue assured hope of their restorement, and so, not vnfitly, he witnessed the re∣newing of his Church by ordeyning as it were twelue newe Patriarkes. Besides thys, he dyd also put the Iewes in mind by that number, too what ende he came. Howbeit forasmuch as they yéelded not themselues too Gods grace, he begat too hymselfe a newe Israell. If a man looke but vpon the first beginnings, these things maye séeme fond: but if yée haue an eye too the sequele, the incredible successe and the fruitfull téeming of the Churche, will shewe that the Apostles not on∣ly matched, but also far outwent the Patriarkes, both in de∣grée of honour, and in multitude of issue. M. Too bée breef, like as the multitude of the Iewes came of the twelue Sonnes of Israel by fleshely generation: euen so the multitude of the beleeuers, (which are mo in number than the sand vpon the sea shore,) issued of the Apostles by spirituall birth: according as Paule full ryghtly saythe, that he begat the Corinthians, Galathians, and others vntoo Christ. 1. Corin. 4. c. 15. and Ga∣lathi. 4. c. 19. and Philem. b. 10. Vpon this example of Christ, the Pope of Rome groundeth himselfe for his obseruing of the number of twelueThe Popes grounding him selfe vpō the number of twelue. in choozing his Cardinalls whome he accounteth as his Apostles. But yet notwithstanding, the Pope thinks it too little for him too haue but twelue Apostles
or Cardinalls, and therfore he hath farre passed that number: like as in all other things he farre ouercommeth the slender∣nesse of Christ. Out of all the Trybes of the children of Israell.All Iewes are not reie∣cted of God. Bicause the Iewes were the first begotten in the householde of God, Iohn maketh mention of them first in order: wher∣by also we learne, that that nation is not so cast awaye, but that a great sorte of them imbraced the promised Sauiour Christ by faithe, according as Paule witnesseth at large, Rom. 11. a. 1. 5. Of the Trybe of Iuda vvere sealed tvvelue thou∣sand. Of the trybe of Ruben vvere sealed tvvelue thou∣sande. Of the trybe of Gad vvere sealed tvvelue thou∣sande. Of the trybe ef Iuda. A. Although Ruben were the first be∣gotten sonne of the Patriarke Iacob (Gene. 29. d. 32) yet not∣withstanding forasmuch as he defyled his fathers bed, his el∣dership was put ouer too his brother Iuda, Gene. 49. a. 4. &. 1. Chronicles. 5. a. 1. And therefore Iuda is reckened in the first place, for our Lord Christs sake, who is the first begotten a∣mong many brethren, Rom. 8. f. 29. Of the trybe of Ruben. In the gréeke Copies, the wordes [were sealed] are not repeated, saue in the beginning and in the ende, neither are they added too euery of the trybes except it be in certein Copies. And the word Sealed commeth of the word Seale. 6. Of The Trybe of Aser vvere sealed tvvelue thou∣sande. Of the Trybe of Nephthali vvere sealed tvvelue thousande. Of the Trybe of Manasses vvere Sealed tvvelue thousand. 7. Of the Trybe of Simeon vvere Sealed tvvelue thousande. Of the Trybe of Leui vvere sealed tvvelue thousand. Of the Tribe of Isachar vvere sealed tvvelue thousand. Of the trybe of Aser. A. Séeke for the interpretation of these
Hebrew names out of Gene. 29. d. 32. &. 30. b. 6. or else out of a booke lately imprinted, and intitled of proper Names. Of the trybe of Simeon. S. The tribe of Manasses is put in the laste verse afore,The reason why the tribe of Dan is not mentioned. & the trybe of Dan is lefte quite out. The reason wherof, the fathers haue rendred to be this: namely that An∣tichrist should be borne of the tribe of Dan, according to Ia∣cobs prophesie, Dan is an adder in the waye, Gene. 49. c. 17. which thing agréeth very wel by mystical signification, (that is to say by the interpretation of the name) vnto Antichrist, that is too say too the Pope. For the worde Dan signifyeth a Iudge. This doth that Antichrist chalendge too hymselfe, in so much as he makes his bragges that he alone may iudge all men, and no man may iudge him. Distinct. 40. Si papa whereas according too Paules iudgement ought too be at the discretion of the Sitters, that is too say, of the Church, 1. Cor. 14. f. 29. He that héereth not the Church, must (as our sauiour sayth) bée counted as a heathen and a publicane, Math. 18. c. 17. Also Paule findeth faulte with Peter, and Peter yéeldeth vntoo him.The reason why the tribe of Ephraim is not mētioned. Galath. 2 c. 14. Nether is the trybe of Ephraim reckened bycause Ieroboam the first king of Israell after the diuision of the Kingdome, beyng of that trybe, made Israell too sinne in the golden Calues, accordyng as the holy historie repor∣teth. 3. Kings. 12. f. 26. 8. Of the trybe of Zabulon vvere sealed tvvelue thousande. Of the trybe of Ioseph vvere sealed tvvelue thousand. Of the tribe of Beniamin were sealed tvvelue thousand. The estimatiō and preroga∣tiue of the Iewes before Gd.Of the trybe of Zabulon. S. By this place appéereth the great estimation of the Iewishe people, considering howe they bée reckened vp in their of springs by name, bycause all kinreds of the earth should atteine blissednesse in the seede of Abraham, according too Gods promises, Gene. 12. a. 3. and. 22. d. 18. and so saluation was too come of the Iewes, accor∣ding as Christ himself witnesse, Iohn. 4. c. 22. A. And this pre∣rogatiue
of the Iewes is to be séene more at large in Math. 10. a. 6. & .15. c. 24. & Luke. 1. d. 33. & .2. e. 32. & .24. g. 47. & Act. 2. f. 39. & .3. d. 25.26. & .13. c. 17. &. g. 46. & Rom. 1. b. 16. &. 3. a. 2. &. 9. a. 4.5. S. For it is that holy stocke whereinto we wylde oliues are greffed. Rom. 11. b. 17. 9. Aftervvard I looked, and beholde a great compa∣ny vvhiche no man coulde number, of all nations and tribes, and people, and tungs, stāding before the throne, and in the sight of the Lamb, clothed vvith long vvhite robes, and palmes in their hands. Afterward I looked, and beholde a great number. &c.Gods Church is not tyed to any one place, M. That huge multitude of men betokeneth the congregation of the faithfull, which is gathered togither from out of many and sundry nations, and conuerted to the faith of Christ in thys last time, at the preaching of the Gospell, notwithstanding the persecutions of Antichrist. A. Whereby we gather, that the Church being Christs spouse is not tied to any one cer∣tayn place, but spred abroade far and wide through the whole world. For God will be called vpon euery where, lyke as al∣so he will haue all men to be saued and to come to the know∣ledge of the truth. 1. Timo. 2. b. 4. Of all Nations.The worde Nation. This is a tearme of generalitie. For the word Nation is verefyed both of the IewesIewes. and of all other peoples. And Tribes. This is spoken in respect of the Iewes, who (as I haue said already) are reckened as the first begotten in Gods house. And people, and tungs. This is meant of the GentilesGentiles. that are conuerted to the faith. For they are accounted vnto the séede of Abra∣ham, who is the father of many Nations, (that is to say of all beléeuers,) the number of whome is as the starres of the skye and as the sand that is vpon the shore of the Sea. Gen. 17. a. 4. S. & Rom. 4. c. 17. Which thing was fulfilled in Christ, who sayd, many shall come from the East and from the West and sit downe with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob in the kingdome of heauen. Math. 8. b. 11. A. And agayne, I haue other sheepe
which are not of this fold, thē also must I bring togither: & they shal héere my voice, & ther shall be made one fold & one shepherd. Iohn. 10. c. 16. Also loke. Ro. 11. c. 24.25.26. & .15. b. 9.10.11.12. Of the diuisiō of tungs Moses hath writtē in Ge. 11. b. 7. And of the thrée cōmon tungs of ye whole world, only ye hebrew tung was counted holy in old time, as in which the law was giuē & the prophets wrate. But when the Gentiles should be called to grace v∣niuersally, then (a wonderfull miracle and such as had neuer bin hard of afore) those hebrues, euen the Lords disciples, spake in ye languages of all nations. Act. 2. a. 4. And then began ye name of the Lord to be magnifyed & blazed abroade by al ye tungs of the world, & both the Gréeke and the latin began to be counted holy as wel as the Hebrue: which thing was foresig∣nifyed in ye title that was fastned vpon ye Crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ. Besides this, the Apostles also are reported to haue writtē in gréeke. Stan∣ding before the Throne. G. To stand before the throne, is to be wel accepted & receyued of him yt sitteth in ye throne: which thing cānot be but through faith. For without faith it is impossible to please God. Hebr. 11. b. 6. And so meant the Lord when he said vnto Abraham, walke thou before me, & be perfect. Gen. 17. a. 1. And in the sight of the Lamb. Christ is not plucked away frō his body, that is to say frō his Church, but he fostereth & cherisheth it, according as he hath promised. Mat. 28. d. 20. And ye cause why the faithful are sayd to be in the Lambs presence, is for that they always haue help & comfort at Christs hand, like as they also depēd wholly vpon him. Clothed with long white robes. A Looke afore in. 6. c. 11. And palmes in their handes. S. G. This is a tokē of the victory which they haue gotten by fayth agaynste the Diuell and the world. A. For this is the victory that ouercommeth the world, euen our faith. 1. Iohn. 5. a. 4. 10. And they cryed with a loude voyce, saying: saluation be from him that sitteth vpon the Throne of our God, & from the Lamb. And they cryed wyth a loude voyce. S. It betokeneth the greatnesse of their desire whereby they wish a happy and blisfull reigne vnto God the father through Iesus Christ, according to the Psalme. 118. d. 25. &. 1. Cor. 15. d. 25. ao they acknowledge the reigning of God the father and of Christ to bée all one. E. The Greeke word Soteria signifyeth rather Saluation than wel∣fare: for otherwise what néeded they to wish welfare vnto Christ?S. Ther∣fore thy acknowledge him to be the only Sauioure, from whome they sooe for helpe and thinke themselues beholden to him for it. And from the
Lamb. M. That is to say, frō Christ become man, A. who was sacrifized for our sinnes. And yet is not the holy Ghost excluded. For wheresoeuer the father and the sonne be named, there also is the holy Ghost emplyed. The like thing is red in the Gospell, The euerlasting life is to acknowledge thée the only true God, & Iesus Christ whome thou hast sent. Iohn. 17. a. 3. 11. And all the Angells stoode about the throne, and [about] the elders, and [about] the foure beasts: and fell downe vpon their faces before the throne, and worshipped God. 12. Saying: Amen Blissing, and Glory, and VVisdome, and Thanksgiuing, ho∣nor, and power, and strength be vnto our God for euer and euer. Amen. And all the Angelles stoode. A. The Angelles stande about the throne, ready (soothly) to obey, prest to help, stout to defend, willing to receiue such as be sealed, quicke to bring thē in, & glad of ye cōpany of those that be sea∣led, S. according to this saying of our Sauiour, There shal be ioy in heauē &c. Luke. 15. b. 7. M. Or else heere is set downe the mutuall reioycing of the Angells in cōfirming the prayse which mē yéeld vnto God. And fell downe. &c. A. It is sayd already, yt the Angells are not able to abide the shyning & brightnesse of Gods maiestie: and therfore they fal downe héere vpō their faces, like as in another place they are said to hide or couer thē. For which thing loke afore. 4. c. 8. And worshipped God. M. That is to saye, looke what worship is due vnto God, ye same did they yeld vnto Christ, of whom it is writtē, & let al his Angells worship him. Psa. 97. b. 7. & Heb. 1. b. 6. Wher∣vpon we gather, that Christ is much more excellent than the Angels. Say∣ing Amen. A. That is to say, cōfirming ye praise that ye sealed had giuen: as if ye Angelles shuld say to the mē that were sealed, It is true that you say, & we agrée to it, & allow of it, and are glad of it as wel as you. Blissing, and Glory, and VVisdome. S. Ther be seuē titles wherin are cōteyned al ye prai∣ses that can be yelded vnto God: P. which may also after a sort agrée to the faithful that be greffed in Christ. For Blissing agréeth cheefly to ye Church, like as it is written, Thy blissing is vpon thy people. Psa. 3. b. 8. For vnto whome he hath giuen his law, to them also wil he giue his blissing. Psal. 67. c. 7. The glory is the same, A. wherof the prophet speaketh thus: Vp O Ierusalem and be enlightned, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is rizen vpon thee. Esay. 60. a. 1. and Paule. 2. Cor. 3. c. 9. And VVise∣dome. Not that wisdome which is begottē of God the father & euerlasting as well as he, but that wisdome which is created in vs and the Angells,
wherevnto the Apostle exhorteth vs, saying: Sée that ye walke circumspectly, not as vnwyse folke, but as wyse folke. &c. Ephes. 5. d. 15. And in another place, walke ye in wisdome, redeeming the time. Coloss. 4. a. 5. And thāksgiuing.Thankesgi∣uing. This must sound continually in the mouthes of the godly: according too the Apostles commaundement, who sayth: Giue thanks in al things. 1. Thess. 5. c. 18. P. Honor,Honor. whereof we reade, glory and honor and peace to euery one that doth good. Rom. 2. b. 10. And power.Power. A. Whereof Peter sayth: And heerevnto giue all dili∣gence, in your faith to minister power, in power knowledge. &c. 2. Pet. 1. a. 5. And strength.Strength. P. According to this saying of the prophet, it is he that giueth courage to the wéery, and increa∣seth the strength and power of him whose force faileth. Esai. 40. g. 29. be vnto our God, supply thou, worthely ascribed, not for a whyle,God must be praysed conti∣nually. but for euer and euer. That is to say, world without end. Wherein is giuen an incling of the continuance of hys prayse. All the day long (sayth the prophet) and all the night long shall they prayse the name of the Lord without cessing. Esay. 62. b. 6. Amen. B. By repeting this word, those heauenly spirites confirme this praysing more and more. And séeing we be taught by so many records and examples of all the Saincts and holy men, let vs learne to leaue all vayne and wicked opinions, and to yéeld all glory vnto God by Christ. 13. And one of the Elders ansvvered, and sayd vnto me: These that are clad in long vvhite robes, vvho bee they? and from vvhence are they come? 14. And I said vnto him, Lord, thou knovvest. And he sayd vnto me, These are they that be come out of great trouble, and haue enlarged their robes, and made them vvhite in the bloud of the Lamb. And one of the elders answered. A. To answer,To answere. is takē in this place, but to speake, like as in Math. 15. b. 10. & .17. a. 4. &. 28. a. 5. and in many other places. These that are clad in long whyte
robes. S. G. After the manner of a diligent scholemaster,Demaunding to the intent to teache. he de∣maundeth to the intent to instruct: whereby is betokened the desire and forwardnesse of those to teach others, whiche are sealed by Gods spirit. A. Euen so whē Christ went about too shew his power to his disciples, he said: Whence shal we buy bread, that these may eate? Iohn. 6. a. 5. And I sayde vnto hym, Lord; thou knowest. M. q. d. Thou canst teach me. And he said vn∣to me, These are they that be come out of great trouble.The greuous∣nesse of Anti∣christs perse∣cution. S. Hée sée∣meth to speake chéefly of the persecution of Antichrist, whych euen by the record of our Sauioure himselfe, is of all other the gréeuousest to suche as are minded to lyue godlyly in Christ: yea and of all other the reprochfullest, bycause it is executed chéefly by suche as will in any wise be counted the godlyest and holyest of all men: howbeit that these wordes may also be rightly vnderstoode of all the godly in generall. For the chosen saincts of God atteine not to the kingdome of heauen but by great afflictions. Act. 14. d. 22. And they must be made lyke the image of the sonne of God, Rom. 8. f. 29. And they must also féele Christs passions in their owne bodyes. Coloss. 1. d. 24. M. These then are come out of excéeding greate trouble into excéeding great rest: out of wretchednesse into glory: out of prison into princelinesse: out of fetters into free∣dome: and finally out of deathe into lyfe. And so is the pro∣phets saying most true, that the troubles of the righteous are many, but the Lorde shall delyuer hym out of them all. Psalme. 34. d. 19. And haue enlarged their Robes.Christes ser∣uants wante nothing. S. The hous∣hold seruauntes of great princes go in large garmentes of sundry coloures, to set out their royaltie and statelinesse vn∣to others: and euen so also doth Christe cloth his housholde, bothe costly and comely. G. Therefore lyke as a shorte and scant garment is a token of pouertie, and a side and large garmente is a signe of abundance: euen so in thys place, the sainctes are sayde to haue enlarged or widened their gar∣mentes, too the end we may vnderstand, that suche as are knit vnto Christe, haue store of riches. For in asmuch as
they be clothed with the righteousnesse and innocencie of Christ, they go at their ease, and also are found to be blame∣lesse and righteous afore God. Concerning whyche mat∣ter see Romaynes. 13. d. 14. and Galath. 3. d. 27. and Ephe∣sians.Our clensing by Christes bloudshed. 4. f. 24. And made them whyte in the bloud of the Lambe. M. That is too saye in faythe, and in followyng the sufferings of Chryste. S M. But howe can bloud make them white, wyll some man saye? I answer, after the same manner that the author of the Epistle to the Hebrues saith, If the bloud of Bulles and Goates, and the asshes of a bullocke besprincling them that are defyled, do hal∣low them as touching the clenzing of the flesh: how muche more shall the bloud of Christe, (who by the euerlasting spirite hathe offered himselfe vnspotted vnto God, (clnze youre conscience from dead workes, too serue the lyuing God? Hebrues 9. d. 13. The Saynctes therefore and the faythfull beyng clenzed by the bloud of the Lamb bothe from originall sinne, and also from actuall sinne com∣mitted through humaine ignorance and weakenesse, and beyng preserued that they shoulde not gyue theyr assente too pestilente errors againste the faithe,The Popes pardōs are the greatest disho∣nour, blasphe∣mie, & defacing of Christes merites and passion, that can be. are saide too haue cleane (yea and also comely) garmentes. And thys place fighteth most manifestly againste the popes pardons. The doctors of Sorbon, the popes greatest flatterers, haue tear∣med the merites of Christ and of the holy Apostles and mar∣tirs, the treasure of the Church. Of this thing they surmise the originall custodie too bee committed to the Bishop of Rome, in whose power there should be the dealing abroade of those so great goodes, that both hée himselfe might bestow them, and also assigne the iurisdiction of bestowing them, o∣uer vnto others. Héerevppon come, from the pope, one whyle full pardons à pena & culpa, and another while pardons but for certaine yeeres: from the Cardinals, pardons for a hundred dayes: and from Bishops, pardons for fortie days. But those pardons (to blaze thē out in their right kind) are a
very dishonoring of Christs bloud, and a mockery of Satans deuise wherewith to leade Christen people away frō grace and from the life that is in Christ, and to tourne them quite from the way of saluation. For how coulde Christes bloud be more fowlly dishonored, than to say it is not sufficiente to release sinnes, and to make attonement and satisfaction for them, except the want of it were supplyed and stuffed out againe, as though it were dryed vp or licked away? The Law and all the Prophetes (saith Peter) beare witnesse vnto Chryste,Cōtrarie mat∣chings against Christes me∣rites & bloud∣shed whereby is shewed the horriblenesse of those par∣dons. that remission of sinnes is too bée receyued by him. Act. 10. g. 43. But pardons graunte remission of sinnes by Peter, Powle, and the Martyrs. Christs bloude (saythe Iohn) clenzeth vs from all sinne. 1. Iohn. 1. c. 7. But pardons make the bloud of Martyrs to be the washyng a∣way of sinne. Christe (saythe Paule) who knew no sinne, was for vs made sinne, (that is to say satisfaction for sinne) that wée myght bée made the ryghteousnesse of God in him. 2. Corin. 5. d. 21. But pardons repose the satisfaction of sinnes in the bloud of martyrs. Paule cryed out and a∣uouched too the Corinthians, that Christe onely was cru∣cifyed and put too deathe for them. 1. Corinthians. 1. b. 13. But pardons beare vs in hande, that Paule and others dyed for vs. The same Apostle saythe that Christe pur∣chaced hymselfe a Churche wyth hys owne bloud. Acts 20. f. 28. But pardons set another purchacing of vs in the bloud of Martyrs. The Apostle saythe, Chryste hathe wyth one oblation perfected for euer those that bée sanctifyed. Hebrues. 10. c. 14. But pardons crye to the contrarye, that sanctifycation is perfected by the Martirs, and that otherwyse it shoulde not bee sufficiente. Iohn in thys place saythe openly, that all the Saynctes haue washed their robes in the bloud of the Lamb: but par∣dons teache them to wash their robes in the bloud of the Martyrs. A. Wherefore letting passe those traytors and blasphemers of the bloud of Gods sonne, let vs not seeke
the true cleannesse of hart and the washing away of our sin, elsewhere than in the bloud of Christ. 15. And therefore they be before the throne of God, and serue him day and night in his temple: and hee that sitteth in the throne shall dvvell vppon them. The spirituall seruice & wor∣shipping of Christ.And therefore they be. &c. S. This séemeth to be meant not onely of that happie and quiet worshipping and seruisable∣nesse, wherethrough the Sainctes being rid of their bodies, do their seruis without the outward and peinfull labor: but also whyle they yet liue héere in their mortall bodies: during all the whiche time, being through continuall earnestnesse of mind set as it were before the throne of god and in that great temple of his in the presence of his elect, they be wholly bent to heauenly seruices, in asmuch as they desire nothing more than to frame their whole lyfe according to Gods will, to the intent their neighbour may be edifyed, and God be gloryfyed in all points and to all respects, according as Paule witnes∣seth that the beléeuers sit with Christ among those that bée in heauen. Eph. 2. b. 6. and also that their conuersation is in heauen. Philip. 3. d. 20. for we haue our harts vpwarde too the Lord, and our seruice is not in outward Ceremonies, but in spirit: for we be not seruants of the letter, but of the spirite. 2. Cor. 3. b. 6. and partly our Temple but specially our sacrifices and préesthoode are all spirituall, and are done spiritually in the kingdome of Christ, that is to wit among the true belée∣uers.The continu∣all worship∣ping of God. And serue him day and night. M. That is to say they be cō∣tinually, S. and without ceassing, occupyed in glorifying God, yea euen when they séeme to be doing other things all the whyle: like as Christ sayth that we must be always praying. Luke. 18. a. 1. And Paule willeth vs to pray without ceassing. 1. Thessa. 5. c. 17. that is to say, to haue the intents of our minde euer bent vpon God. After this sort is the widow Anne sayd, not to haue departed out of the temple day nor night. Luke. 2. e. 37. A. And Dauid auoucheth that man to be blissed, whych
occupieth himselfe in the law of the Lorde day and nighte. Psalm. 1. a. 2. And hee that sitteth vppon the Throne shall dwell.Of Gods dwelling with his elect. S. That is to say, according to the promis of the scriptures, he will be their God, and they shall be his people: he wil walke vp and down in the middes of them, and take charge of their matters: he will further them and defend them. Leuit. 26. b. 12. and 2. Cor. 6. d. 16. And on the other side, they shall do all things with singular reuerence and awe according to hys appointment, as they that are present in Gods sight. By the word Dwell is betokened frendship, familiaritie, and compa∣nie betwéene God and the elect: A. according as Christ saythe, If a man héere my voyce, and open me his dore, I wil come in vnto him, and sup with him and he with me. Heeretofore. 3. d. 20. S. And Iohn sayth, Our felowship is with the father and with his sonne Iesus Christ. 1. Iohn. 1. b. 3. Therefore the happinesse of the chosen must not be estéemed after the vn∣derstāding of the flesh, but according to Gods promis, wher∣by he hath assured them of all good things, in asmuch as hée hath promised to be their defender, yea and also to rewarde them most plentifully. Gen. 17. a. 2. 16. They shall not hunger nor thurst any more, nei∣ther shall the sunne light vppon them, nor any heate. They shall not hunger. S. The same words almost,The happines of the chosen vnder Chri∣stes reigne. hath the Prophete vsed where he prophesyeth of the happinesse of Gods people that were brought againe from the Captiuitie of Babylon. They shall not hunger nor thirst (sayth he) no heate nor sunne shall strike them: for he that pitieth them will guide them, and leade them vnto the springs of waters. Esay. 49. c. 10. Howbeit through that happinesse as it were in a counterfigure, the prophet had further foresight: namely that the happinesse which was to come vnder the reigne of Christ, should be fulfilled (specially in spirituall things) part∣ly euen in this life, and fully in the life to come. For Godli∣nesse hath promis of the life present and to come. 1. Timo. 4.
c. 8. Héerevnto therefore perteine the things that are red e∣uery where in the Psalmes and prophets: of which sorte bée these sayings: Thou hast giuen him his harts desire. Psalm. 21. a. 2. And, the Lord is my shepeherd, therefore shall I want nothing. Psal. 23. a. 1. Also, of the brooke of thy pleasures shalte thou giue them drinke. Psal. 36. b. 8. Agayne, behold, my ser∣uants shall eate, behold my seruants shal drinke. Esay. 65. a. 13. Also concerning Christs shéepe, vnder the figure of Dauid, I will feede them (sayth he) in the mountaines of Israell, by riuers and in all resting places of the land in most battling pastures will I féede them. &c. Ezech. 34. c. 13.14.15. And Christ our Sauior sayth: He that commeth to me shall not hunger: and he that beléeueth in me shall not thirst for euer. Iohn. 6. d. 35. Also, as my father hath appointed me a king∣dome, so appoynt I it vnto you, that ye may eate and drinke at my Table in my kingdome.What is ment by eating and drinking. Luke. 22. c. 29.30. And to eate and to drinke are metaphorically taken to leade a happy life and full of pleasure. So also, not to hunger nor to thirst is takē for the full suffizance of all desires,Not to hūger or thyrst. bycause meates & drinkes are of that sort of things, that we most desire and care for in this life: A. according as Christe sheweth Math. 6. d. 31. And therefore the scripture calleth vpon vs to lay away all care of foode and all thoughtfulnesse for this present life,We muste not be ouer care∣ful for world∣ly things. and too leaue them vnto God alone: lyke as when it saythe, Cast thy burthen vpon the Lord and he will beare thee vp. Psalm. 55. d. 22. And, Be not carefull what ye shal eate, or what ye shall drinke &c. Mathew. 6. d. 31. Séeke yée firste the kingdome of God & the righteousnesse of him, and all these things shall be cast vppon you.A defence a∣gaynst trou∣bles and per∣secutions. Mathew. 6.33. Also, Verily I say vnto you, there is none that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father or mother, or wyfe or children, or landes for my sake and the Gospels, but he shall receyue a hundred folde now in this tym, [euen] houses and brethren and sisters, and mothers and chyldren, and lands with troubles, and in the world to come life euerlasting. Marke. 10. d. 29. Againe, Bée
not afrayd of them that kill but the body. &c. For euen the heares of your head are all of them numbred Math. 10. c. 28.30. With suche shéeldes meant Christe to fence our weake∣nesse, that wée shoulde not feare the tyrants of this world, be they neuer so cruell. For what can Tyrants do more, than banish men out of their countries, put them to reproch, spoyle them of their worldly goodes, shut them vp in prison, torment them with hunger and thirst, mayme their limbes, and lastly also put them to deathe? Sauing that Antichrist, mounting aboue all these things, vaunteth himselfe to haue a certaine power ouer the dead.God assuageth the anoyances of the fayth∣full. Neyther shall the Sunne lyght vpon them. He alludeth to the South countries, where the heate of the sunne doth wonderfully anoy suche as dwel in those coasts. By reason wherof, we reade that a cloudie pil∣ler shadowed Gods people a day times, that they might not be scorched wyth the heate of the Sunne. Exodus. 13. d. 21. Therefore by thys borowed spéeche, héere is betokened, as well the asswagement of all troubles in this present life, as the finall end of them in the lyfe to come. A. Héerevppon Paule sayth: GOD is faithfull and will not suffer you to bée tempted aboue youre power: but rather euen in the verye temptation hée wyll make a waye out for you, that you maye bée able too beare it. 1. Corinthians 20. c. 13. 17. For the Lambe that is in the middes of the Throne, shallOr feede thē. rule them and leade them to springs of lyuing vvater, and God vvill vvipe avvay all teares from their eys. For the Lamb. &c. A. That is to wit,The continu∣all ioye and quietnesse of the godly. Christ the Lambe of God, whiche taketh away the sinnes of the world. Iohn. 1. e. 36. Shall rule them. E. In the gréeke it is Poimanei, which signify∣eth to feede, or to rule as a shepeherd ruleth hys shéepe: S. lyke as it is in Ezechiel. 34. c. 13.14.15. & in Iohn. 10. c. 14. & in Act. 20
f. 28. and in the Psalme. 23. a. 1. And leade them to springs of liuing water. Of which springs Christ treateth plenteously in Iohn. 4. b. 10. & 7. f. 28. Also Esay. 55. a. 1. & Ezechiell. 36. e. 25. Iohn then meeneth that all the godly shall euer be merie and in safetie: not that they shall be vtterly priuiledged from all trouble, but bycause they féele incredible ioy, euen in aduer∣sitie: according to this saying of the Apostle, we be distressed in all things, and yet not discouraged: we be in daunger, and yet not helplesse: we suffer persecution, and yet are we not forsaken.The sorow of the godly are turned into gladnesse. 2. Cor. 4. b. 8.9. And God will wipe away. &c. M. That is to say, he will swallow vp all cause of gréefe and heaui∣nesse, S. through plentifulnesse of vices: he himselfe will com∣fort them abundantly, and sorrowes shall no more be had in remembrance. A. For lyke as the gladnesse of the wicked is tourned to excéeding sorrow, as Iames witnesseth. 4. c. 9. so the sorrow of the godly is tourned into ioy: like as the scrip∣ture witnesseth. P. Behold I make Ierusalem merrie and hir people glad, and I will triumph in Ierusalem and reioyce a∣mong my people, neither shall the noyse of wéeping and wai∣ling be heard in hir any more. Esay. 65. c. 18. And blissed are they that mourne, for they shall be comforted. Math. 5. a. 4. Also your heauinesse shall be turned into ioy. Iohn. 16. c. 20. and many such other texts which are to be red euery where. The faithfull then being safe all the while through hope are merrie in hart and of all men most quiet, euen in the middes of persecution, yea and in the middes of death, no lesse than if they were a flote and had all the welth of the world at com∣maundement, bycause those inconueniences and displea∣sures cannot bereeue them of aught that is theirs: according to this word of comfort, When men hate you. &c. reioyce and be glad, for greate is youre reward in heauen. Mathew. 5. b. 11. Also, reioyce, bycause youre names bée written in Heauen. Luke. 10. d. 20. Also, he kéepeth all his bones, and not one of them shall be broken. Psalme. 34. d. 20. And, pos∣sesse yée youre soules by your patience. Luke. 21. d. 19. And,
the lightnesse of our affliction for a little while, purchaceth vs an euerlasting wyght of glory wonderfully aboue measure, in asmuch as we haue not an eye to the things that be seene, but to the things that are not séene. 2. Corin. 4. d. 17. M. And Iohn saith All teares, to do vs to wit,The diuersitie of the sorowes of the godly. that the teares of the chozen are many and diuers, according to the diuersitie of their troubles. For some man wayleth bycause he hath done euill: and some man bycause he hath done no good: another bycause he endureth the sharpe stripes of correction: another bycause he is assaulted with sinne: another bycause he wan∣dereth from Christes kingdome: another bycause he séethe Christes word despised: and some bewayle the blindnesse of other men. But of all these the Lord will make an ende and reward his chosen with euerlasting comfort. This selfsame sentence shall be repeted more at large hereafter, in the one and twentith Chapter and fourth verse. The eyght Chapter. ANd vvhen he had opened the seuenth seale, there vvas silence made in Heauen almost halfe an houre. ANd when he had opened. &c. A. In this Chap∣ter Iohn sheweth Gods most gréeuous ven∣geance against the despisers of his heauenly word, to the end that the godly may knowe, how their prayers which they offer continu∣ally vnto God shall not be superfluous.The last iudge¦ment. The seuenth Seale. G.S. The things that are disclosed in thys last seale, do properly perteyne to the last day of iudgemente, wherein Chryst the iudge of the quicke and the dead, shall vtterly destroy all hys enimies, and make them hys foote∣stoole. Psalme. 110. a. 1. G. Then shall God bée all in all. 1. Cor. 15. d. 28. and Chryste shall reigne without any gaynesaying.
S. Wherevnto perteine the things that are written in Esay. 66. e. 15.16. and Dan. 12. c. 7. and Ioel. 3. a. 2. and Zacha. 14. a. 2. And Malach. 4. b. 6. Which places, although they speake of certaine particular iudgements according to the outwarde purport: yet do they chéefly agrée vnto that day and vnto those times wherin the Lord shall aduenge his people at the hands of Antichrist: and cōsequently to the last generall iudgement, which shall ensew shortly after the same aduengemente: at which time he shall of all other most royally vtter his power to the full, against the kingdome of Satan. Whereof our Sa∣uior Christ speaketh in Math. 13. d. 30. & .25. e. 31. and Iohn. 5. e. 28.29. And moreouer the Apostle Paule. 1. Corin. 15. c. 25. &. 1. Thessa. 4. d. 16. & .5. a. 1. 2 3. & .2. Thessa. 2. b. 8. And also Peter 2. Epist. 3. c. 10. There was silence made in heauen,Silence in heauen. almost halfe an houre. By this halfe houre, seme vnderstand the meane time betwixt the destruction of Antichrist, and Christs comming to iudgement. But for asmuch as the warfare of the Churche must be endlesse in this world: such manner of rest is not too be looked for in this world. Besides this, Antichrist shall ne∣uer be put quite away, till Christ himselfe come. 2. Thessa. 2, b. 8. Wherefore we rather say, that this silence shall be in heauen, at such time as the soules of them that be slayne shall cease their crying for vengeance, bycause they sée the Lordes rightfull iudgement vppon the wicked, who then shall suffer due punishment for their wickednesse. And by the halfe houre is rightly vnderstoode the beginning of the euerlasting rest, bycause the number of seauen is appoynted to resting Gen. 2. a. 2. 2. And I savv seuen Angelles standing in the pre∣sence of God, and seuen trumpets vvere giuē vnto thē. And I saw seuen Angelles. G. Héere now agayne Iohn descri∣beth in order the state of the Church, frō the firste beginning of Christes reigne, vnto the end of the world. Standing in the presence of God. S. That is to saye, prest and ready to go in
with Gods commaundements, and to performe them spéede∣ly. And seuen Trumpets were giuē vnto them. TrumpetsTrumpets. serue to many purposes: among which, this also is one, that publike magistrates are wont to publish and proclaime the lawes & ordinances which they haue made by the sound of trumpets. The same vse dothe Iohn assigne héere to the Angelles: by whome notwithstanding we may well meane the Apostles and ministers of the word: according to this commaundemēt of the Lord giuen vnto Esay, Set out thy throte and crye, streine thy selfe as a trumpet, lift vp thy voyce. &c. Esay. 58. a. 1. And Christ said to his Apostles, Looke what I say vnto you in the darke, speake you it in the light: and that whyche you héere in the eare, preach yée vppon the house toppes. Math. 10. c. 27. 3. And there came another Angell, and stoode be∣fore the Altar, hauing a golden senser: and vnto hym vvere giuen many perfumes to offer of the prayers of all sainctes vpon the golden altar vvhich is vppon the throne. And there came another Angell. M. This Angell is Christe,Christ the me∣diator. sent by the father into the world to execute the office of a me∣diator, and to preserue the elect from the wyles of Satan. And stoode before the Altar, hauing a golden senser. S. Héere Christ is set out vnto vs as a high préest and mediator to offer the prai∣ers of the faithfull vnto God the father. And Iohn alludeth too the Tabernacle, whiche was made according to the heauen∣ly patterne that was shewed vnto Moyses in the mount, Hebrues. 8. b. 5. And vntoo hym were gyuen many perfumes.Christs inter∣cession for vs, and our ioyne intercession with him for our selues. A. Then is it Christs peculiar charge, too bryng too passe by hys intercession, that our prayers may bée accepted of God. In respect whereof he is said too bée our mediator and aduocate with God the father. 1. Timo. 2. b. 5. & .1. Iohn. 2. a. 1. For although he sit aboue at the right hand of the father, hol∣ding all things in subiection vnder his féete: yet notwith∣standing
he executeth the office of our mediator, gently allu∣ring vs vnto him, and making intercession to the father for vs, according as Sainct Paule sayth, he liueth for euer too make intercession for vs. Heb. 7. d. 22. In the same respect al∣so saint Iohn saith, If any man sin, we haue a faithfull aduo∣cate with God the father, euen Iesus Christ the righteous. 1. Iohn. 2. a 1. G. Wherevpon it followeth, that if any man wyll condemne vs, he not only disanulleth Christs death, but also wageth battell againste his soueraine power. B.V. Therfore there is no cause why the faithfull shoulde feare damnation for their sinnes, so they giue them not the bridle and shrinke away from their faith. M. For it were the greatest reproche that could be against Christes preesthood, if we should imagin his intercessiō to be vneffectual: and so should it be also if we shoulde not ioyne our owne intercession vnto his interces∣sion. And therefore, C. this so great assurednesse whereby a man may be bold to outface the diuell, sinne, death, and hell gates, must be settled in all the harts of the faithfull, bycause our faith is no fayth except we assure our selues for a cer∣teintie that Christ is ours, and that the father hath good ly∣king of vs in him.The doubting of Schole di∣uines concer∣ning their sal∣uation. The maner of Christes in∣tercession. Nothing then can be imagined more pla∣gie and more deadly, than the doctrine of the Schoolediuines concerning vnassurednesse and vncertentie of saluation. And as touching the manner of Christs intercession, it must not be measured by mans reason. For we must not surmise him to knéele rufully before his father, holding vp his hands to him to intreate him. But he is worthely said to make in∣tercession, bycause he appéereth continually before his fa∣ther, with his death and resurrection, whiche are in sted of outward sewing, and haue the force of liuely intreatance by speech, to make the father at one with vs, and to win vs hys fauor, that we ourselues also may haue frée accesse with our prayers vnto the throne of mercie and grace. And marke well the generall tearme All. For Christ is not said to offer the prayers of some saincts only: but of all Saincts: to the end
thou maist vnderstande, that God the father liketh or accep∣teth no mans prayer, which is not offered too him by Christ. Too what purpose then doo the Papistes with so great wyl∣fulnesse force vpon vs the intercessions of the saincts decea∣sed, syth the onely intercession of Christ is ynough for all Saincts? for there followeth. 4. And the smoke of the perfumes [that came]Some copies haue, with. of the prayers of all Sainctes, vvent vp before God, out of the hand of the Angell. And the smoke of the. &c. S. This smoke betokeneth the ear∣nest affection of faith, according too this saying:The zelous affection of faithful prayer and effectual∣nesse thereof before God. let my prayer bée caryed vp as incense, in thy sight, Psalm. 141. a. 2. Such were the prayers of the fathers for the performance of the promises made too Abraham & Dauid concerning the haste∣ning and aduauncing of the kingdome of the Messias: & suche are the godly mens prayers at this day, when they say, Thy kingdome come, Math. 6. a. 10. And doubtlesse such manner of feruent and deuout prayer of the godly, perceth the heauens, according as Iames witnesseth, 5. d. 16. S. Therefore by thys place wee see what the weapons of the Churche bée, where through it may stand safe from the power of the aduersarie: namely prayers kindled by the fire of tribulation, and offered vp by Christ, like as it is said héere, that the smoke of the per∣fumes that came of the prayers of Sainctes went vp. Before God. M. for lyke as water cast intoo a fyre rayseth a smoke: so teares of the Sainctes besprinckled in their prayers, make their prayers fauorable, swéete, and mounting vp afore God: who can not but receyue the thing that he knoweth too bée offered vntoo him through his déere beloued Sonne Christ. Out of the hande of the Angell. That is too say, by the Media∣tor and intercessor Christ.
5. And the Angell toke his censer and filled it vvith fire of the Alter, and cast it into the eatrh: and there fol∣lovved thunderings, and voyces, and Lightenings, and earthquakes. The holy Ghost is giuē to Christes ministers and to all the fayth¦full.And the Angell. &c. M. Bicause the preachers of Gods word are sent of Christ himselfe too perfume men with the sent of the truth: he is sayde too haue taken his censer and too haue filled it with fire of the Alter: whereby is ment, that ye hartes of the Ministers of Gods worde, are replenished with fer∣uentnesse of the holie Ghost, too vtter ye sound doctrine abrode without fear. And cast it into the earth. S. Luke auoucheth that this thing befell vpon the verie day of Whitsontide. Actes. 2. a. 1. And in the same sense dooth Peter (in the same place in the .xvij. verse) expounde the prophesie of Ioel. 2. g. 28. G. And of this spirit also, (which is figured vnto vs héere by heauenly fire,) were the Samaritanes partakers, when Peter and Iohn were sent vnto them from the rest of the Apostles. Act. 8. c. 17. So was Cornelius and those that were with him in∣spired with the same holy Ghost while Peter was preaching at Cesaria. Act. 11. b. 15. The same thing happened to certaine Ephesians, yea euen by visible signe. Act. 19. a. 6. And nowe it happeneth to the faithfull inuisibly, when the graces of the holy Ghost are bestowed vpon thē to the inlarging of Christs kingdome. Howbeit Iohn séemeth héere too allude to ye place of the Prophet which saith:None are mete mini∣sters of the Gospell, but such as haue Christes spirite. One of the Seraphins flew vnto mee hauing a burning cole in his hand, taken vp from the al∣tar with a payre of tongs. &c. Esai. 6. c. 6. whereby is signifyed that men cannot bée made méete ministers of the Gospell, but by heauenly fyre. A. In consideration whereof, after Christes resurrection, before he sent awaye his Apostles too the prea∣ching of the Gospell, wee reade that he breathed vpon them, and said. Take yée the holy Ghost, whose sinnes so euer yée release, they bée released vntoo them: and whose sinnes so e∣uer yee withhold, they are withhild. Iohn. 20. e. 23. Paule also
sayth, Who also hath made vs fit ministers of the new testa∣ment. &c. 2. Corin. 3. b. 6.The maiestie and power of Gods worde when it is vt∣tered. And there followed Thunderings and voyces. S G. The beginning of the preachig of the Gospel hath a certeine likenesse too the beginning of the publishing of the Lawe, Exod. 19. c. 18. Héerevpon Luke maketh mention of a great noyse, and of wynde, and of the shaking of the house Acts. 2. a. 2. And the Apostle sayth, whose voyce did then shake the grounde, and nowe hath sent vs worde saying: yet once ageine I shake, not onely the earth, but also the heauen, Heb. 12. g. 26. Now then, by such surmounting Metaphors héere is betokened the myghtinesse of Gods word, whereby al things are beaten downe that aduaunce themselues against Gods knowledge, according as Paule witnesseth. 2. Cor. 10. b. 5. For the spéeche of the liuing God is dreadfuller than al thunder, lightening and earthquakes. Which thing appéereth by this, that when the Lord spake his wordes, the people stood afraid and amazed a far off saying vnto Moses, Speake thou with vs and we wil héere thée, and let not God talke with vs, least peraduenture wee dye, Exod. 20. d. 19. Whervnto also pertei∣neth this that the Prophet sayth, The word of God is liuely, and workfull, & sharper than any two edged sword, cutting &c. Hebr. 4. c. 12. And surely, séemed not those sayings of Peter to be a great and horrible thunder, when after the receyuing of the holie Ghost from heauen, he sayd too the people, Iesus of Nazareth a mā approued among you by God with signes and wonders. &c. Him haue you persecuted and put too death by the handes of wicked men? At the héering whereof they were pricked in hart, and said: men and brethren what shall we do. &c. Act. 2. d. 22.37. And likewise the things that Steuen said, Acts. 7. f. 51. A. Also such maner of earthquake may be re∣ferred to the troubles and debates that spring vp by reason of the Gospell, which troubles our Sauiour describeth at large in Mathew the. 10. e. 34.35.36. and in Luke. 14. f. 26.
6. And the seuen Angels vvhich had the seuē trum∣pettes, prepared themselues to blovve. Preachers must be dili∣gent & payn∣full in their charge.And the seuen Angells. &c. G. As many as are sent of God to bée ministers of his woord, prepare themselues to denounce his iudgement against the rebelles and vnbeléeuers, and too minister the pure doctrine of the Gospell vnto Christes shepe, too the ende they may go through with their charge stoutly & diligently, according as Marke witnesseth in speaking of the Apostles: They went their waies and preached eueriwhere, and the Lorde wrought with them and confirmed their say∣ings by miracles that ensued, Marke. 16. d. 20. Also Paule and Barnabas beeing called intoo the same worke by God, went out of hand vnto Seleucia, and after they had sayled too Cy∣prus, when they came too Salamine they blew vp the trum∣pet in the héering of the Iewes: that is too saye (as Luke re∣porteth) they preached the woord of God in the Synagogs of the Iewes, Acts. 13. a. 45. Likewise those that bée called to the ministerie of the woord at this day, must prepare themselues too blow vp the trumpet of the Gospell, and nothing must pull them backe from preaching the worde of the Gospell too the people with a constant mynde. Else shall they féele the ven∣geance of Gods hand, and bee driuen out of the Lordes house wyth shame lyke dumbe dogges: accordyng too thys saying of Paules: woe bée vntoo mée if I preache not the Gospell, 1. Cor. 9. c. 16. 7. And the first Angell blevve his Trumpet, and there vvas made hayle and fire mixte vvith bloud: and they vvere cast intoo the earthe: and the thirde parte of trees vvas burnt, and all greene grasse vvas burnt vp. Preachers of Gods iudge∣ment in for∣mer times of olde.And the first Angell. &c. A. Now followeth what ensued vp∣on the declaration of Gods wil by the ministerie of the prea∣chers of his word. S. There are which thinke, that by the se∣uen trumpets are betokened the seuen sorest iudgementes of
God, vnto the laste and finall iudgement: beginning backe∣ward at Noes flud, and so procéeding foorth too the seuenth & last. And so the first Angell shoulde betoken those preachers that published and witnessed Gods iudgement in the time of the first world, and of the confusion of tungs and of Sodom: such as Noe and Lot were. The second shoulde beshadowe Moses and Aaron,Moses and Aaron. who (as it were by the blast of a trumpet) sounded forth Gods iudgement of the drowning of Pharao with the chéefe of his nobilitie and al his furniture of warre. The thirde should resemble those that had tolde many afore∣hand, of Gods iudgement concerning the rooting of the Gen∣tils out of the land of Chanaan. And so may bée sayde of the rest of the preachers of Gods iudgement. A. But it is better too apply these things and the rest, too the state of the Church vnder the new Testament. Therefore the first Angell shall in this place represent vnto vs, as many as bothe disclosed & openly preached the truth of the Gospell, immediatly at the first springing vp of it. G. And Iohn hath heretofore described such preachers vnder resemblance of the whyte horse, 6. a. 2. And there was made Haile and fire mixt with bloud.Calamities en∣suing vpon the cōtempt of the Gospell. Forasmuch as the word of the Gospel is vnto some ye sauour of death vn∣to death, and vntoo othersome the sauour of lyfe vnto lyfe. 2. Cor. 2. d. 16. It must not séeme straunge, that men be diuersly minded at the heering of it. Therefore that which is spoken héere of haile and fyre, may bée referred too the Iewes, which wilfully resisted the preaching of the Apostles. Wherby they prouoked Gods vengeaunce against themselues for setting lyght by his warning, and so fell into miserable calamities. Which thing is foretokened by bloud, fire, and smoke in Ioel 2. g. 30. Wherevnto also séeme too belong the things that are written in Sophonie. 1. d. 10. And herewithall Iohn alludeth too the wonders that were wrought either in the flud,Calamities & troubles are not casual, but come by Gods prouidence. or vp∣on Sodom, or in Egypt, like as the scripture is woont too al∣lude vnto such things in other places also. And they were cast into the earth. A. Then do not such calamities happē vnto mē
by chaunce, but by Gods prouidence, and iust iudgement for despysing of the Gospell: To the end wée may learne, that as ofte as God speaketh vntoo vs by his seruauntes, wée must quake at his spéech, least he being iustly displeased at our vn∣thankefulnesse, sende foorth sundrie plagues out of his store∣house, and vtterly destroy the rebells. And the thirde parte of trees was burned: He manaceth great myserie too come vpon all men, and specially vppon the Iewes for despysing Gods counsell towardes them: namely shewing that they shall pe∣rishe with sworde, hunger, and pestilence: which are resem∣bled by hayle, bloud, and the réeke of smoke, in Ioel. 2. g. 30. But the godly are strengthened in faith at the sight of suche wonders, when they learne by proofe, yt God is present with his woord, according as he hath promised. Ageine, the sinners also which are curable among the multitude, bethinke them∣selues of theyr witlesse errours, and fall too the fearing of God. And finally the wicked are swept away, that there may bée roome for the godly.The order of Gods puni∣shing. A. By the way it is too bée marked, that when the Lord purposeth too punishe men, he is com∣monly woont too begin at the brute beastes, and to shewe the signes of hys displeasure in them, too the intent that men takyng warnyng betymes, may eyther amend in good ear∣nest, or else bée made vtterly vnexcusable. The holye sto∣ries witnesse that it happened so vntoo Pharao. Exod. 7. b. 10. Therfore as oft as we see any scarcenesse of the fruites of the earth, or dearth of other things: let vs assure our selues, that vengeance is at hande to light vpon our heades, except wée turne away Gods iudgement by repentance. 8. And the seconde Angell blevve his trumpet, and as it vvere a great hill burning in fyre vvas caste intoo the Sea, and the thirde parte of the Sea vvas made bloud.
And the seconde Angell. &c. These things agrée too those that are expounded in the opening of the second seale, héere∣tofore. 6. a. 3.4. for they treate of the horrible persecutiōs that spring vp for the Gospells sake. &c. But therwithall is some∣what added concerning the destruction of them that persecute the faithfull preachers of Gods woorde, and the reste of hys true worshippers.The swalo∣wing vp of the Romane Empire by Christes king¦dome. And as it were a great Mountaine burning on fyre. M.G. There are that by this great mountaine burning on fyre, vnderstande Sathan the Prince of the world inflamed with the heate of enuie for the preaching of the Gospell: who béeing by Gods sufferance cast intoo the Sea, (that is too saye among people and Nations) hath inforced many Princes and many other men too shed giltlesse bloud. S. Neuerthelesse for as much as the Scripture dothe oftentymes betoken, by mountaynes Kingdome, and by the sea strength and pui∣sance: it séemeth that in this place, by the mountayne is be∣tokened some puissant Kingdome, that chalengeth souerein∣tie too it selfe ouer all other Kingdomes: which notwyth∣standing must bée vtterly swallowed vp of some other migh∣tyer Kingdome, as a Mountayne is swallowed vp by the sea. Which thyng is very trymly verifyed of the Romane Em∣pyre, whyche is the strongest of all that euer were in the worlde, and of the Kingdome of Heauen which is Christes Kingdome. Dani. 2. g. 45. &. 7. g. 27. And Christ himselfe saithe, When a strong armed man kéepeth hys house. &c. Luke. 11. c. 21. Also, nowe is the iudgement of the world, nowe shall the Prince of thys worlde bée cast oute of the doores. Iohn. 12. e. 31. And, Bée of good chéere: I haue ouercome the worlde, Iohn. 16. d. 33. And by deathe he hathe displaced him that had power of Deathe, that is too say, the Diuell. &c. Hebr. 2. d. 14. Then doothe this seconde Angell bring glad tydings too the Churche:Christians muste arme them selues to continual en∣counter. namely that the Kingdome of the worlde shall gyue place too Christes Kingdome, and bée swallowed vp of it as of a moste houge Sea. In the meane season, all the godly are warned, too prepare themselues too incounter
and to patience, bycause the world shall alwayes bée putting them too their plunge, till the wicked bée quite and cleane dis∣patched: which thing shall not bée done throughly, before the last iudgement day. In respect wherof this mountaine is said too bee on a burning fyre: that is too say inflamed with anger and furie ageynst the Kingdome of Christ: like as Luke re∣porteth that Saule breathed out threatnings and slaughter against the Lordes Disciples, Acts. 9. a. 1. Such vniuersally were all the Priests, as well of the Iewes, as of the Gentils who inflamed both the Emperors and ye Lieutenantes of the Romanes too persecute Christ. Like as at this day experience teacheth vs also. And the third part of the Sea was made bloud. He meaneth that there was made so great bloudshed after the preaching of the Gospell, that that state might be lyke∣ned too some bloudie Sea: which thing the nexte verse ope∣neth more at large. 9. And there dyed the third part of the creatures that vvere in the sea, vvhich had life: and there perished the third part of the Shippes. Gods merci∣fulnesse.And there dyed. &c. A. q. d. The trouble and persecution were so great, that the third part of creatures perished. But by the way it is too bee marked, that Gods mercie is therewithall commended in this place. For séeing that there dyed but a third part of the creatures, and the other two partes were left aliue: thereby wée are done to vnderstand, how the thing is most true which ye Prophet sayth: namely, His mercie is vpon all his workes Psalm. 145. b. 9. A. And, when thou arte angrie thou wilt remember mercie. Habacuk. 3. a. 2. S. Also, mercie triumpheth ouer Iustice, Iames. 2. c. 13. And there pe∣rished the third part of the shippes.Churches de∣faced by per∣secution. A. By the word Shippes he be∣tokeneth the sundrie Churches that had professed Chryst. G. These (saithe he) were tossed with so many and so greate stormes of persecutions, that they had almost forgone theyr name. For in many places, both the calling vpon God, and
also the open preaching of the Gospell had ceased, by rea∣son of the cruell persecutions of Sathan and hys Mini∣sters. 10. And the thirde Angell blevve hys trumpet, and there fell a great star from heauen, burning as it vvere a cresset, and it fell into the third part of the riuers, and into the springs of vvaters. And the thirde Angell blewe. &c. A.Persecution by Heretikes. For as muche as the Church is exercysed wyth aduersities moe wayes than one, as hath béene sayde heeretofore: nowe Iohn setteth downe another kynde of persecution wherethrough the Churche of Christ is tormented by heretikes and corrupters of the holy doctrine. And that is a horrible and verie cruell persecution. For it is all one as if one should gyue a hungrie person poy∣son in sted of meate. And there fell a great starre from Heauen. S.G. Thys starre signifyeth some notable archeheretike, who by hys heresie shoulde open a gap for many errours after∣warde. Suche a one was Simon Magus,Simon Ma∣gus. Actes. 8. b. 9. out of whose heresie sprang many other, as Eusebius witnesseth in the thyrtéenth Chapter of hys seconde booke of the stories of the Churche. And suche were Manicheus, Nouatus, Ar∣rius, and Pelagius,Manicheus, Nouatus, A∣rius and Pe∣lagius. who were all of them Archeheretikes and the causers of innumerable errours. Such are sayd to bée falne oute of Heauen, bycause manye of them falling a∣waye from the true faythe, imbraced errours and leasings in sted of the purenesse of Gods woorde. Also they bée called Starres, bycause they bare some countenance of godlynesse in the company of the Sainctes: by reason whereof they were also had in some estimation, and after a sorte ouer∣countenanced others: which thing Paule foretolde too the Ephesians by the spirit of prophesie. This I am sure of (saide he) that after my departure there shall enter in among you, sore Wolues, which shall not spare the flocke: and euen out of yourselues shall step vp men that will speake froward
things, too leade away Disciples after them. Acts. 20. f. 29.30. And Iohn saith, They went out frō among vs, but they were not of vs.The double burning of he∣retikes. &c. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 19. Burning as a Cresset. B This maye bée expounded two wayes: either that such séeme to burne be∣fore men, as well in holinesse, as in doctrine: or else that they bée wholly inflamed with excéeding spight, against the sim∣plicitie of the scripture and the folowers therof. And it fell in∣to the third part of the Riuers.Corruption of Scripture by Heretikes- By the names of Riuers & wa∣tersprings, is ment doctrine, like as it is to bée gathered of the Prouerbes. 5. c. 16. and of Iohn. 4. b. 10. and. 7. f. 38. Then doo heretikes marre, corrupt, and falsifie the scripture with their froward interpretations. And so the pure meaning of fayth is troubled, and the sweetenesie of Gods worde becommeth bitter, or at leastwise weareth away. 11. And the name of the Star is called vvormvvoode, and the third part vvas turned into vvormevvood: and many men dyed of the vvaters, bycause they vvere be∣come bitter. And the name. &c. G M. WormwoodWormewood. is an herb fayre ynough too the eye, but very bitter too the taste. Euen so heretikes and as many as fauour Antichrist, the more they séeme to excell in holinesse,A description of false Pro∣phets and false teachers, and howe they ought to be tried and a∣uoyded. the more doo they anoy. A. Therefore they must be examined the néerlyer, that their craftinesse may be made open, and men may beware of them. According as the sayde Iohn exhorteth vs in another place, saying deerly beloued, giue not credit to euery spirit, but trie ye spirites whither they be of God: for many false Prophets shall come into ye world 1. Iohn. 4. a. 1. And Christ besides his warning of vs, doth al∣so gyue vs markes whereby to knowe them. Beware (sayth he) of false Prophetes, which come vntoo you in shéepes clo∣thing, but inwardly they bee rauening Wolues. You shall knowe them by their fruites, Math. 7. b. 15.16. These fruites doth Paule expresse yet more precisely, saying: I beséech you brethren haue an eye to them that cause diuision and giue oc∣casions
of euill, contrarie to the doctrine which ye haue lear∣ned, & auoyd them. For they that are such, serue not the Lord Iesus Christ, but their own bellies, & with swéete preachings & flattering words deceiue the harts of the simple, Rom. 16. d. 17.18. And in another place, for such maner of false Apostles (saith he) are craftie workers turning themselues into ye like∣nesse of the Apostles of Christ. 2. Cor. 11. c. 13. Agein in another place he peinteth thē out thus: I know that after my depar∣ture there shall enter in among you rauening wolues, which shall not spare the flocke. Yea and euen of your selues there shall rise vp men speaking peruerse things, to drawe Disci∣ples after them. Act. 20. f. 29. Finally S. Peter describing thē in lykewise prophesyeth of thē thus: There were false Pro∣phets also among the people, euen as there shalbe false tea∣chers among you, which priuily shal bring in damnable sects euen denying the Lord that hath bought them, and bring vp∣on themselues swift damnation, and many shall follow their damnable wayes by whō the way of truth shall be euil spokē of, & through couetousnesse shal they with feined words make marchandize of you. 2. Petr. 2.1.2.3. Nowe albeit that these markes and fruites aforesayde bée generally incident too all Hypocrites, Heretikes, and false teachers: yet notwithstan∣ding they most fitly agrée to the ministers of the Romish An∣tichrist. And among thē is M. chéefly to be noted the hipocrisie of ye begging Fréers,The Hipocri∣sie of the beg∣ging Friers. who with their shéepish clothing, preten∣ding a countenance of holinesse, haue deceiued ye whole world and piteously made hauocke of Christs flocke: A. which thing would God that the Kings & Princes of christendome (speci∣ally those that will néedes be counted most Christian) would diligently and aduisedly wey. B. For those Fréers pretend ho∣linesse, simplicitie, and honestie, in their apparell, behauiour, spéech, and outward countenance: but in mind they be spite∣full, couetous, catching, and cruell. Neither do they runne & gadde about, to performe the charge of godlynesse, or too fur∣ther Christes shéepe with wholsome counsell: but to dispatch
their owne buisinesse, too inriche themselues, too fill their bel∣lies, and to scatter & teare in péeces Christes flocke. M. Hardly can the open méeting of a woolfe be escaped without harme, and how shall men doe then if he steale vpon them disguised in a shéepes skin.The tryall of Teachers. B. Let no man therfore be easie too be led by the gay shewe of teachers. For although a man bestow large almsse, and shew himselfe too bée a great faster by his leane body, or speake he neuer so earnestly and zealously, & leade he neuer so angelicall a life: yet must not all that he teacheth be therefore beléeued out of hand: but men must trie what com∣meth from him by the spirit of God, and what of his own pri∣uate affection, and to what end the thing tendeth that is alled∣ged by him.The fruites that we shuld iudge Tea∣chers by. For the meanes whereby these false teachers de∣ceiue men, (which also are their P fruits wherof Christ war∣neth vs to take heede,) are as well euill doctrine, as euyll maners. For heretikes haue alwayes some manifest wicked doctrine, which is impossible too bée incident too the Churche. Wherfore wée must beare in mind, yt all doctrines must bée tried by the worde of God: and therefore that in discerning of false Prophetes the chiefe stroke must bée stricken by laying them to the groundes and principles of our beleefe.Howe to scan and iudge doc∣trines. P. To the intent then that doctrin may be rightly iudged of, it behoueth vs too keepe a rule, that is to say a true and certaine determi∣nation of the scripture vpon euery article & point of doctrine in such wise as it may plainly & openly be shewed too bée the proper & continuall determinatiō, by the writings of ye Pro∣phets & Apostles, in laying together the texts whole and not mangled. Thē must we also seeke for the testimonies of the Church next after the Apostles times, (specially out of such writers as are knowen to bee of the purer sort) so as we may bee assured of the continuall consente of Christes Catholyke Church, & that no new opinion may be brought into ye church without good recorde of soundnesse. Héerewithall also let vs match godly conference, let the godly conferre among them∣selues concerning the doctrine, and let the opinions of other
skilfull persons bée herd also, and let these shew their opinion gently and vncorruptly, and on the contrarie part be content too héere other men patiently. Let the consent of the godly bee such, that they may with godly zeale séeke out the truthe, and with the feare of God gyue sentence according too the scrip∣ture. Finally they must consider what God inioyneth too his Prophetes and too the Ministers of his worde: for thereby shall their faithfulnesse be easly discerned.An image of true teachers. As for examples sake, if we set before vs the things that Paule requireth in Bishops. 1. Tim. 3. a. 2. &. Tit. 1. b. 6. that one description alone will be ynough too condemne the whole rable of the Papacie, in as much as the Popishe Massemongers séeme of set pur∣pose too set out a flat cōtrarie image of teachers. And therfore no maruell though they cannot abyde too haue men iudge of false Prophetes.Descriptiō of false teachers. And the thyrde parte was turned into worme∣wood. He sheweth howe manie are easely deceyued by the founders of errours. For in as muche as they speake the things that are pleasantest too the world: the world fauoreth them, and followeth their errours willingly, according too thys saying of Chryst too his Disciples, If yée had béen of the world, the world would haue loued the thing that is his own, Iohn. 15. c. 19. And, many shall come in my name, saying: I am Christ, and shall deceyue manie. Math. 24. a. 5. Also Paul saithe, The time will come, that men will not away wyth sound doctrine, but according to their owne lusts, they whose eares itch shall get them a heape of teachers, and shall turne away their eares from the truth and giue themselues too fa∣bles. 2 Tim. 4. a. 3.4. And Peter saith, many shall folow them into destruction. 2. Peter. 2. a. 2. And manye men dyed.The fruite of false doctrine. G. He meaneth such as cleane vntoo Heretiks. For like as froward doctrine leadeth men away from Chryst, who alonely is the true and euerlasting life: so must it néedes driue men to end∣lesse death. Héerevpon Peter sayde,False doctrin bringeth bit∣ternesse in the ende. Vntoo whome shall wée go? Thou hast the woorde of euerlasting lyfe. Iohn. 6. g. 68. Bycause they were become bitter. A. Althoughe the doctryne of
deceyuers doo please men at the firste blushe, and lyke them well that receiue it: yet if men looke throughly intoo it (as reason would they should:) it hath none other swéetenesse, but such as is deceytfull and deadly.The swete∣nesse of Gods worde, Contrariwise, the pure woorde of the Lord is wonderously swéete and full of grace, howbeit vnto the faythfull onely, and too suche as receyue it by fayth. Heerevpon Dauid saythe. The Statutes of the Lorde are rightfull, and chéerefull too the hearte: the pre∣ceptes of the Lorde are pure and gyue lyghte too mens eyes Psalm. 19. b. 7.8.9. And ageine, howe sweete are thy sayings vntoo my throte? Yea swéeter than honnie vntoo my mouth, Psalm. 119.103. But if the woorde of God séeme bitter vntoo any men: that is too bée imputed too the corrupt iudgement of themselues, and not vntoo the nature of the woorde: ac∣cordyng as Paule the Apostle teacheth. 2. Corin. 2. d. 15. and 4. a. 3.4. 12. And the fourth Angell blevv his Trumpet, and there vvas smitten the thirde part of the Sunne, and the thirde parte of the Moone, and the thirde parte of the Starres, so as the thirde parte of them vvas darke∣ned, and there shyned not the thirde parte of the daye, and likevvise of the night. The distresse of the faythful by reason of persecution raised by Ma¦humet and the Popes.And the fourth Angell blewe. G. The things that are spoken in this place, doo match with the things that are set downe in the opening of the fourth seale. For after that the Heretikes were after a sorte ouercome and confounded: certeine godly seruauntes of Christ tooke in hand with great constancie, too mayntine the truthe, ageinst so manie pestilent errours, whych were sowed abroade euerywhere by the Heretikes, and led awaye many from the truth. B. Wherevpon it came too passe, that the number of deceyuers grewe so great, as well in Asia and Affrike by the workyng of Mahumet, as in Europe by the practize of the Popes: that too auoyde the persecution, the faythfull were fayne too séeke deserte places
and caues of the earth, and too dwell in mountaines and high Rockes in manner vnapprochable, not without great ieo∣perdie of lyfe: and all too kéepe still the purenesse of doctrine: accordyng as is reported of the Waldenses, and of certeine godly brethren dwelling in Beame, whiche coulde neuer fynde in theyr heartes too submitte their neckes to the yooke of Antichriste as others did, But yet in the meane whyle, some that were mingled with them, fléeted from the faythe, and so the number of the faythfull was abated, and diuided intoo sundrie sectes.The darkning of the sunne, or the falling away of the chiefe Lan∣ternes of the Church from the truth. And there was smitten the thirde parte of the Sunne. S. Christ is the daysunne of ryghtuousnesse, and the cléerenesse of the euerlastyng lyght: whose Apostles are termed by himselfe the lyghte of the worlde. Math. 5. b. 14. Therefore the thyrde parte of the sunne is sayde too bée smit∣ten, (that is too saye too bée Eclipsed or darkened) when the théefest sort, (that is too say, such as vaunt themselues too bée Christes vicars and the Apostles successors) start away from Christes Gospell, vntoo theyr owne traditions. Lyke as when VictorVictor. excommunicated the Easterne Churches for kéepyng of the Easter otherwise than the Westerne Church dyd. Or as when Lyberius,Liberius. eyther through constreint of feare, or bycause he was not in hys righte wyttes, stepped intoo the Heresie of Arius. Or as when BonifaceBoniface. obteyned the supremacie ouer all Churches in the worlde, at the hand of the Emperour Phocas.The reading of the Scrip∣tures forbid∣den. Meates for∣bidden. Or as when hys successors cha∣lendged too themselues alone, the interpretation of the scrip∣tures and the determination of all questions concernyng faythe. Or as when they forbad all beléeuers the vse of certeyne meates, whereas Chryst gaue all men leaue too vse all meates wythoute exception. Or as when they made mariage vnlawfull, for the Clergie in generall,Mariage for∣bidden. and for the whole Churche in certeyne degrées which Gods Lawe forbyddeth not. Or as when they accounted it an honour for them and their Clergie, too make warre for Saincte Peters patrimoniePeters patri∣monie. (as they terme it) and for other trifling causes: and
innumerable other things of the same stamp, which feight ful butte against Christes Gospell: wherby it commeth to passe at length, that euen the chiefe Emperours thinke it lawfull for them too doo manye things, which are in no wise lawfull for Christian Princes.The Churche hath loste the light of Gods worde. And the thirde part of the Moone. That is too saye, a great parte of the Church hath lost the true light of Gods woorde, whyle men giuyng themselues too certeyne gewgawes and fables, began too despyse the simplenesse of the scripture: which thing Paule feared sore, least it shoulde happen too the Corinthians, when he wrate too them after this manner. I am afrayd least it shoulde come too passe, that like as the Serpent beguiled Eue with his wilinesse, so your vnderstandings shoulde bée corrupted from the simplicitie that was too Chrystwarde. 2. Corin. 11. a. 3. A. But alas for so∣rowe. Not onely the Corinthians, but also al Christendome, haue by little and little so falne away from the soundnesse of faythe, & the purenesse of Gods woord, that at length it hath scarcely followed any one steppe of the primatiue Churche. And the thyrde parte of the Starres.The bishops and teachers of the Church are falne from the true light. S.G. That is too say the most parte of the Byshops and Doctors of the Churche, yea and of those also which gouerne the common weale and are rulers ouer others: in so muche that wée may nowe saye with the Apostle, G. where is the wyse man, where is the Scribe, where is the disputer of this worlde? 1. Cor. 1. c. 20. S. For it woulde become a Byshop too excell all other men, (not onely of ye layitie, but also of the clergie) in knowledge & skil of gods law, yt if there happened any questiōs about ye faith, he might be able to discusse them, or if there budded vp any heresies in the Church, he might be able too plucke them vp with the wée∣dinghooke of gods word, according as Paule writeth, Tit. 1. c. 9. Agein it would become him to excell al mē in the Church in holinesse of life, that he might be an example & patterne to his flocke.This is true generally in the Papists. 1. Peter. 5. a. 3. But in these dayes they not onely are not learned themselues in gods Law, but also can not a∣bide thē that be learned. Nay rather into their courtes flocke
all Thrasoes, Cyclopes, Rakehelles, and Bellygods from all quarters, gréedely deuouring ye goodes of the Church, wher∣with the learned sort and the poore members of Christ ought to be cherished. Blind are they, and guides of the blind. Mat. 15. b. 14. Yea they be welles without water, and mists caried about with the wind, for whom the euerlasting mist of dark∣nesse is kept in store. 2. Peter. 2. d. 17.The vtter de∣facing of the Church by the Papists. So as the thirde parte of them was darkned. q. d. Christ the daysunne of righteousnesse hath bin darkned for the more part. B. The Churche hath lost hir former brightnesse, and the rulers of the people are be∣come fooles, and haue lost the true vnderstanding of the scriptures. To be short, there is not almost any more resem∣blance (be it neuer so small) of the primitiue Churche too bée séene, considering how most men are fléeted away from the traditions of the Apostles, to their owne lusts. Wherefore it must not séeme straunge, though the Lorde haue made the shepeherds and Ringleaders of his people despised, accor∣ding to the Psalm. 107. d. 38. and Iob. 12. c. 18. and giuen them vnto be trampled vnder mennes féete like vnsauery salte, Math. 5. b. 13. according as this day beareth witnesse.Expounding of Scripture ceaseth. And there shyned not the third part of the day. G. Hée méeneth that the ex∣pounding of scripture had ceased, bycause that they whyche should haue interpreted it to the people, were indewed with no knowledge thereof. Also in asmuch as they were voyde of good works, they could by no meanes edify the rest. Héere∣vppon came darknesse and blindnesse vppon the whole bodye. 13. And I looked and herd an Angell flying throgh the myddes of Heauen and saying vvith a loud voyce, VVo, vvo, vvo, to the inhabiters of the earth, by reason of the rest of the voyces of the three Angelles that vvere yet to blovve their trumpets.The diligence of preachers in warning the Church of pe∣rils to come. And I looked, and herd an Angell. &c. S. The olde translation hath Eagle in sted of Angell, flying through the middes of hea∣uen.
M.The diligence of preachers in warning the Churche of perils to come. That is to saye, romyng about through the vniuersall Church, wherevnto Gods secrets are committed. This An∣gell representeth any godly teacher inflamed with zeale of Gods glory and desire of edifying his Church: who foreséeing Gods iudgements to come for such heresies and wicked ab∣hominatiōs, doth with stout courage, vnwéeriable indeuer, and lowde voyce giue double and treble warning thereof to the Church of God.The careles∣nesse of the wicked. VVo, wo, wo, to the inhabiters vpō the earth. E.S. In some gréeke Copies the word VVo is red but twice: which is not so much a cursing, as a foretelling ioyned wyth a sorinesse for it, as if it were said: alas silie men, the worlde goeth worse and worse with you. For the thinges that the thrée Angells which follow shall foreshew, shall be despised, and Gods iudgement shall hang the heauier ouer such as re∣sist & are stubborne. By reason of the rest of the voyces. &c. These should foreshew the incredible calamities of the latter times, which should farre passe the calamities of the former times were they neuer so horrible. Math. 24. b. 21. &. 2. Thes. 2. c. 9. A. And yet shall all these things be laughed at as fables by the vngodly, who are wont to put off the day of the Lorde too a long tyme. Of whome Peter speaketh at large. 2. Peter. 3. a. 3.4. The ninth Chapter. ANd the fifth Angell blevv his Trumpet, and I savv a Starre fall from heauen into the earth: and vnto him vvas giuen the key of the bottomlesse pit. ANd the fifth Angell blew. &c. A. Iohn declareth in this Chapter, howe it is through the craft and wickednesse of Satan, that the world is seduced by deceiuers and flatterers vnder ye reigne of Antichrist. For thus must we thinke: that the authors of heresies take
occasion of persecutions, to rend the Church in péeces, and to sow abroade sundry errors: wherevnto God of his iust iudge∣ment sendeth successe, to the intent that they which woulde not obey the word of truthe, should follow errors and lyes too their owne destruction, according as the Apostle witnesseth. 2. Thessa. 2. c. 11.12. And I saw a Starre fall from heauen into the earth. S. Some thinke that héere is betokened the Diuell, of whome Christ speaketh thus.The falling a∣way of the chiefe mini∣sters from the truthe. I saw Satan falling from heauen as it had bin lightning. Luke. 10. c. 18. A But Chryste treated there, of the force and effectualnesse of ye doctrine of ye Gospel, which he auoucheth to haue so large scope, that al the Tyrannie of Satan which he executeth vpon al mankinde, falleth whole to ye groūd. Wherfore it answereth ye text bet∣ter, to vnderstand ye cheefe ministers of ye Church by ye name of Star, as we haue done in other places. For it is certayne, that they do now and thē step aside frō ye vnitie of ye faithful, forsake the truth, giue themselues to worldly wisdome, & fol∣low sundry sects & heresies. Therfore whereas Iohn telleth vs, that this star fel frō heauē: he doth vs to vnderstand, that the authors of heresies créepe not commōly out of ye dregges of ye people, but step out of the cōpany of those yt be had in e∣stimatiō aboue others among the faithful, according as wée haue shewed by diuers places of scripture, héeretofore. 8. c. 10. And vnto him was giuen the key of the bottomlesse pit. S.Errours and Heresies come not into the Church with∣out Gods pro¦uidence. A key is a token of power or authoritie and publike administratiō receyued. Iohn therefore méeneth, ye God in his wrath hathe gyuen power too heretikes and deceyuers to thrust their diuelish opinions into the Church. G. Thou séest openly héere (lyke as in many other places of the scripture) how it happe∣neth not but by Gods prouidence, that errors and vn∣truthes are brought in to deceyue men withall: wherevnto also he giueth suche force and effectuall working that they go for good payment, as I sayde alittle afore.The Popes keyes. Therefore we see heere how power is giuen vnto deceyuers & heretikes to sow their errors openly abrode, & to seduce fond men by
vayne philosophie: the doctrine of whome is rightly likened to a bottomlesse pit. For like as no man is able to gage the ground of a bottomlesse pit: euen so the more a man follo∣weth the doctrine of heretikes, so much the lesse substancial∣nesse and profit shall he finde. S. And in this place we sée the byshop of Romes keys which he boasteth of so greatly, for héere followeth. 2. And he opened the bottomlesse pit: and the smoke of the pit vvent vp as it had bin the smoke of a greate furnace: and the Sunne vvas darkned, & the aire [also] at the smoke of the pit. And he opened the bottomlesse pit.The opening of the botom∣lesse pit. •. After that such decey∣uers be once giuen vp to a reprobate mind, and the way set open for them to lye and to beguile such as are of the weaker sort: then they sow abroade their errors whither they list, S. and all manner of hereticall frowardnesse créepeth foorth. A. Which thing (the more is the pitie) we sée too much fulfil∣led in these our latter times. For the errors whiche lurked erst in the harts of heretikes the fauorers of Antichrist, haue begon to be professed in the open face of the world, and haue led away many from the purenesse of doctrine, and from the way of saluation. G. Héereby is the way of perdition, and con∣sequently the palace of Satan set open: namely when God suffereth such to teach, and to seduce, and to do what they list at their owne pleasure. This is another manner of key than that wherewith Christ openeth and shutteth, before. 3. b. 7. For this key may make a man starke blinde, but enlighten him it cannot.Heresie is like the plague. And the smoke of the pit went vp. It is a peculi∣ar propertie of heresie to attaint many by and by after the manner of a plague. For when vngodlinesse, misbeléefe, and heresie reigne, it is al one as if fire being kindled in a queach of bushes, shuld light into a thicke wood, and so a great smoke shoulde rise of it. Heretikes do also winde themselues into Christes flocke, and priuily shed out their poyson to mischéefe
men, whiche increaceth foorthwith and infecteth many. And therefore it is likened to a smoke rising vp out of a greate furnace: by which tearme is betokened the wylinesse of Sa∣tan. And truly al heresies packed togither in one,All heresies confirmed by the Pope. haue recei∣ued force, strength, and authoritie by Mahumet and the By∣shop of Rome. And to the intent to speake of the one of these which is more manifest vnto vs, we will in this place make the thing apparāt which we haue said.A playne de∣scription of Poperie. For what else is Po∣perie, than a certaine filthy sinke of all diuelish superstitions? For of the Iewes it hath borowed holydayes, choyces of meates, anointings, halowings; fastings, sumpteous Church vessels and apparell, and other Ceremonies of the same sort, and broughte them into Gods Churche to the preiudice of Christian libertie. Likewise of the heathen they haue boro∣wed Idolles and images of God and of Christ our Sauioure, and of the Saincts, cursings, and pilgrimages to stocks and stones, ouer and beside shauings of the head, sects of Monks, close Nunnes, single life of Clearks, and such like. Also it forbiddeth mariage and meates, as the Tatians did: It rob∣beth Christ of his Godhead as the Arrians did: for it prefer∣reth itselfe before him, in asmuch as it chalengeth power o∣uer the dead, eyther in fetching them out of purgatory, or in canonizing them for saincts. It imbraceth Christs grace as the Pelagians did, by stablishing mans frée will, and by tea∣ching merites and satisfactions by his owne works. To bee bréefe, there is not so pestilent an heresie, which is not defen∣ded in poperie, if a man wey it throughly. I pray you, is it not an opening of the bottomlesse pit, that soules may tum∣ble downe into it without number, (as it is said in Esay. 5. d. 14) When the Romish bishop boasteth in his decrées, that although he draw innumerable soules with him into hell by his pestilent heresies,Errours recei¦ued by autho∣ritie are tokēs of Gods hor∣rible vengeāce at hand. there to be tormented with endlesse punishments, yet ought no man to say vnto him, Why doest thou so? But like as smoke is a foretoken of fire, euen so er∣rors receiued by authoritie are foretokens of excéeding cala∣mities,
according as a mā may sée in the bookes of the kings and in the prophets. M. Moreouer like as a furnace fyneth Gold and consumeth the drosse of it vnto ashes: euen so the froward doctrine of heretikes comming out of Satās forge, exerciseth the elect and tryeth them out from the reprobates: like as Paule sayth, There must néedes be sects also among you, to the intent it may be séene who are tryed among you. 1. Cor. 11. d. 19. Therefore let vs leane our selues vnto thys benefyte of Gods prouidence. For heretikes are made of such maner of men, as would go astray neuerthelesse though they were in the Church.Howe Here∣tikes do good to the church. But for asmuch as they be without the Church they do very much good, not by teaching the truthe, whereof they be ignorant, but by stirring vp the carnall ca∣tholikes to séeke the truth, and the spirituall Catholikes too open the truthe.Kings, Prin∣ces, & Magi∣strates thrust from ye truthe by Popes and poperie. And the sunne was darkned. S. In this place, by the Sunne, are meant the choycest sort, both of the Clear∣gie, and also of Princes. For who seeth not that the best Charises, Othoes, Henries, Sigismunds, Friderikes, and Maximilians were tumbled downe from the pure vnder∣standing of the Gospell, into popish darknesse and mazes? and in likewise that many byshops, being otherwise not so ill disposed princes, were eyther for feare or by darknesse of ignorance, wrapped in the dim mist of the popish decrées? They therefore whyche ought too kindle the lyght of truthe for others,Common people. were striken with horrible blindenesse them∣selues. And the ayre. A. That is to wit, the Christian people which should haue bin enlightned by their herdmen and ru∣lers, with the doctrine of the Gospell, like as the aire is en∣lightned by the Sunne.Popery is but smoke. At the smoke of the pit. That is to say, by the frowarde and corrupt doctrine of deceyuers and he∣retikes. But this is no small comfort to the godly, that false doctrine, (suche as Papistrie is,) is lykened to smoke. For thereby wee bée giuen to vnderstand, that it vanisheth away with a trice at the appéering of the truthe: A. accor∣dyng too thys saying of Paules, They shall not preuayle a∣ny
more: for the fondnesse of them shall be layd open vnto all men. 2. Timo. 3. c. 9. 3. And out of the smoke there came Crickets vpon the earth, and povver vvas giuen them like as the scor∣pions of the earth haue povver. And out of the smoke there came Crickets.Suche in all poynts are the teachers of Papistrie. M.G. Lyke as Crickets bréede of corrupt smoke: so do the disciples of Anti∣christ bréede of the vntoward doctrine of Heretikes. And not vnfitly are such compared to Crickets. For neyther do they flye aloft by contemplation of heauenly thinges, nor yet go steadely vppon the ground by liuing after the appointed or∣der of God: but are hoysed vp a little whyle by pride, and streightways lep downe againe vpon the earth.The prating of Papistes about fonde quiddities. S. For Anti∣christs doctors, behighting high thinges concerning the holy Trinitie, slip aside by and by to most fond quiddities, wher∣in at length they spende all theyr whole teaching. So also they kéepe a maruellous stirre and brawle about the An∣gelles, whyther they differ in sorts or but only in number: after what manner an Angell of hygher degrée speaketh too an Angell of lower degree: and of the place, mouing, and wor∣king of them. Also about the mystery of Christs incarnation,Christes con∣ception. whither it were done at an instant: whither the virgin hys mother could at the first instant worke with the holy Ghost in the making and shaping of his body: & whither the worde could haue made a stone of it, or a woman, or an Asse, or sin, or finally a wicked feend. Furthermore, they make a mar∣uellous raking through all the ten predicaments for won∣ders in the sacrament of thankesgyuing: as for Transub∣stantiationTransubstan∣tiation. or accidentes remayning without substance, for the suffering of the same accidentes and for the doyng and suffering of Chrysts bodye as in the Sacramente. Also aboute the daungers and cautions of the Masse:The Msse. aboute the peynes of soules in Purgatory,Purgatory. and the prayers whereby they shoulde be reléeued: about the coniuringConiuring, of
Sprihtes that appéere about the caces of conscience, and in what things a simple préest may assoyle or not: Of whyche matter there is much ado made, and great bookes written, which they tearme the Summaries of Christen men. Also a∣bout the power of the chéefe préest, to whome they attribute the diuell and all: about Pardons and Iubilies,Pardons and Iubilies. by whych the rigor of the Canons concerning penance is qualifyed. At Gregorie the great, a thousand yéeres after the birth of oure Lord,When statiōs and pardons began first. began first the open Stations and pardons of ye Chur∣ches of ye Citie of Rome. Boniface the eyght, about the yéere of our Lord a thousand and thrée hundred, ordeyned that the IubileThe Iubilie. should be euery hundred yéere. Clement the sixthe brought it backe to euery fiftith yéere. And Sextus the fourth brought it downe to euery fiue and twentith yeere, pretēding the shortnesse of mans life for a cloke to their owne gayne. Furthermore they talke much of those mōstrous gere wher∣of their Rational of diuine duties treateth: and of the mules, hattes, and cappes, and trayne of their Cardinalles and By∣shops: of the ringing or not ringing of belles: of the hoodes, scapolets, and girdles of Monks: and a thousand other things of the same stampe, wherein they ground their perfect and ful diuinitie. Besides this, like as Crickets & gressehoppers eate vp the frutes of the earth, and hurte the herbes and all o∣ther things very much with their byting: according as when the Lord minded to chastize his people, he saide he woulde send store of Gressehoppers among them, Deuter. 28. d. 38. Euen so do these varlets deuoure all things and make vn∣cleane and vnprofitable,The bellifil∣ling friers. whatsoeuer they do but touche. A. Which thing a man may sée cheefly in those whiche make the foure orders of the begging (or rather of the bellyfilling) fréers. For they do both defyle the benefytes, gifts, and gra∣ces of God wherewith Christ hath enriched his Churche, by their stealing away the word of truth and by kéeping ye peo∣ple away from the knowledge of the Gospell: and also they snatch, deuoure, and wast, whatsoeuer frutes of the earthe
they can come by. And power was giuen them. M. In thrée re∣spects are heretikes (and specially the disciples of Antichrist and hipocrites) compared vnto Scorpions.The Papists compared to Scorpions. First bycause that like as a Scorpion, whereas he is méelde to looke vnto, dothe at length strike priuily with venemous sting: so these men pretend simplicitie before the world and yet work mischéefe by diffaming men behinde their backes. Secondly bycause that as the Scorpion stingeth with his tayle: so these men preferre temporal gaine before spiritual graces, S. and wound mens cōsciences deadly whē they promis most to help them. And thirdly bycause that like as when a Scorpion stingeth with his tayle, he is not felt at the first, but yet sheddeth in his poyson by little & little afterwarde: So they that be beguiled by these heretikes, feele not the wound at the first, but when the poyson hath rancled through al the inward parts, thē they féele themselues stung in the end. A Of these men the Apostle writeth thus: They that be of that sute, serue not the Lorde Iesus, but their owne bely, and deceiue the harts of the simple through fayre spéech and flatterie. Rom. 16. c. 18. 4. And it vvas commaunded them that they should not hurt the grasse of the earth, nor any greene thyng, nor any tree, but only the men that haue not the Seale of God in their forheads. And it was commaunded them. &c.None but re∣probates shall be hurt by An¦tichrist & his adherents. S. First Iohn doth vs too wit, that these Crickets or Gressehoppers were not suche as were sent in old time into Egypt for vengeance. Exod. 10. d. 12. nor such as God threatneth in the Prophets, to eate vp the grasse of the earth and the gréene herbes and the trees: but much more hurtfull ones, bycause they hurt men and wound them to deathe. And secondly he sheweth that although the swarmes of these Crickets shall be great, yet shall they hurte no man, but only such as the Lord hath by his iust iudgemēt reiected. The grasse of the earth.The simple sorte. M. That is to wit ye rude & sim∣ple of beléefe, which seme easy to be deceiued like as grasse is
easly feared vp. Nor any greene thing. That is to say, none of those that be any thing liuely in the doctrine of the Gospell. Nor any ttee. That is to saye, nor any man that is already made strong by faith, and frutefull works. A. And so are the chozen descrybed diuersly, bycause there is not the like mea∣sure of faith in all of them.Who bee tor∣mented by An¦tichrist. But only the men that haue not the Seale of God. That is too say, the faithlesse and vnbeléeuers which liue after the lustes of the flesh, S. and haue not the witnesse and subscription of the holy Ghoste that they be the verie sonnes of God by faith in Iesu Christ, and by the new birth of the mynd in his woord, but labour to be admitted in∣to the number of Gods children for their owne deseruinges and their owne woorks. These are wonderously tormented, and yet attayne it not that way: according to this saying of Paules, Being ignorant of Gods ryghtuousenesse, and sée∣king to stablish their owne, they are not subiect to the ryghte∣ousnesse of God. For Christ is the end of the lawe to iustifie all that beléeue. Rom. 10. a. 3.4. Such a one also was the Pha∣risie, which made great boast of his fasting, tything, and other workes: & yet could not become rightuous for all that, Luke. 18. b. 11.The saluation and welfare of the godly is impregnable.A. But héere is a greate comfort set downe for all the godly, when they heare that their saluation and welfare is most stedfast, in somuch as they cannot bée led from the faith by any slyghts of Satan or deceyts of heretikes, though they bée assayled dyuerse wayes by the wicked ministers of the Diuell. This doth our Sauyour Christ confirme, saying: There shall ryse vp false Christs & false prophets and woorke greate wonders and miracles, so as euen the elect myght bée led into error if it were possible Math. 24. b. 24. And when Paule had treated at large of such as should bée deceyued by the wyles and craftinesse of Antichrist, immediatly he spake to the faithfull, saying: But we haue to giue thankes vntoo God always for you brethren beloued of the Lord, for ye God hath chozen you to saluation from the beginning, by sanctify∣cation of the mind, and beléefe of the truth. 2. Thess. 2. c. 13. And
Christ speaking of his owne shéepe, saith: no man shal plucke them out of my hand. Iohn. 10. c. 28. And again, I haue kepte them whome thou hast giuen vnto me, and none of them is perished sauing that lost child, that the scripture might be ful∣filled: Iohn. 17. b. 12. Iudas had not Gods seale, bicause he was a diuell and an hipocrite, and voyd of the holy Ghost. The Lord then knoweth those that be his. 2. Timo. 2. c. 19. There∣fore let it not offend vs though the whole worlde be blinded and giuen vp to a thousand errors. For none shall perish but such as are ordeined to perish: as for the elect, not one of them can perish. For first and formost it is to be noted, that such as be elected, cannot but come vnto Christ one time or another, according as he himselfe sayth, All that my father giueth vn∣to me shall come vnto me. Iohn. 6. f. 57. Which thing appée∣reth also by the example of Nicodemus whiche came vnto Christ by night Iohn. 3. a. 2. and likewise by the théefe hanging vpon the Crosse. Luke. 23. f. 42. And secondly it is to be conside∣red, that such as Christ hath once taken charge of, G. although they would of set purpose perish, yet can they not perish. For Christ plucketh them backe from perishing, like as he called backe his Apostles into the right way when they beléeued not ye women that brought them tidings of his resurrectiō: Luke 24. b. 11. & like as he stayed Peter from vtter falling away, by turning backe and looking vpon him in the house of the hygh préest. Luke. 23. g. 60. A. Happy therefore are they whome God the father hath committed to the kéeping of hys sonne Christ. In their forheads. Looke before. 7. a. 3. 5. And it vvas giuen vnto them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented fyue mo∣neths: and their torment vvas as the peine of a Scorpi∣on vvhen he hath stung a man.Popishe tea∣chers are worse than murtherers & theeues in mar¦tyring mens consciences. And it was giuen vnto them. &c. A. Iohn sheweth consequēt∣ly, that deceiuers and heretikes are more perilous than mur∣therers and théeues. For these kill a man out of hande and
dispatch him out of the way: but the other do after a wonde∣rous manner miserably martir mens soules, till they haue thrust them quite downe into hell fire. S. And certesse it can∣not be vttered how horribly the popish doctrine of the super∣stitious shauelings concerning the iustifying of the vngodly, tormenteth the minds of them that are priuie to their owne sinnes: when they teach, that first they haue néede of sorinesse, and afterward that of sufficient sorinesse is made contrition,Popish shrift. which must be done for euery seuerall sinne, besides that all deadly sinnes with their circumstāces, (yea and as some adde all veniall sinnes to) must be numbered or reckened vp in shrift to a mans owne Curate. Moreouer, that euery sinne must haue his satisfaction or penance, the whiche he must néedes fulfill before he fall into another sinne: and that if hée do it not to the full in his life time, it must be accomplished in purgatory after his death. Wherevpon sprang pardons and prayers for the dead.Pardons, praying for the dead. Now there be innumerable cases, wher∣by a man dothe (euen with the very déede dooing) runne in daunger sometyme of the greater curse and sometime of the lesser curse,Excōmunica∣tion or cur∣sing. according to the rigour of the Canon law, wherof not euen the holiest hermit of them all can sufficiently shifte his hands: and as for those that méene to liue lyke Christians indéede, there is no remedie but they must néedes fall into it. And had not the Byshop of Rome vsed a point of policie in exempting himselfe from all lawes, and making himselfe a∣boue all lawes: hée coulde not passe one houre withoute fallyng intoo both the curses. Howe then shall the feare∣full consciences beehaue themselues among so manye snars? No doubte but suche consciences are martyred wyth so sore tormentes, as are more intollerable than the verye deathe of the body: yea and they haue driuen many intoo vnrecouerable despayre, and made them fordo themselues with their owne hands. Fyue moneths. A. That is to say euen to thir old age. M. For this present life is accom∣plished by destinction of sixe particular ages. And the
torment of them was as the paine of a Scorpion when he hathe stung a man.The priuie ve¦nime of Papi∣strie. A. By these words he méeneth that hipocrisie and flatterie are peculiar to heretikes. For they do then wounde sorest, when they séeme to speake fairest: and when they pro∣mis saluation and quietnesse of conscience, then do they cast snares vpon mens consciences & miserably slea their soules. Besides this, at the first beginning there is no great greefe felt: it gayneth strength by péecemeale, and at length tor∣menteth wonderfully. If remedie be applied in time, the poi∣son is not deadly: but if it be not applyed, he that is stung dy∣eth of it. Euen so is it with him that is seduced by the doctrine of Antichrist. 6. And in those days men shall seeke death and not find it: and desire to dye, and death shall flee from them. 6. And in those days. &c.The horror of conscience in papistrie. S. So horrible is the plight of the fear∣full and misinstructed consciences (as I said afore:) that they could find in their harts to be rid of it, euen by death. And scarsly shall a man find any more forlorne, than euen those that brag of the perfecter religiousnesse of life, as the Monks of the Charterhouse and the reformed sorte (as they tearme them) whose consciences are neuer at rest. And they shall de∣sire to dye, and deathe shall flee from them. A. By these maner of spéeches the Scripture is wonte to betoken excéeding greate torment of mind. For sith that nothing is dreadfuller than death: whē the Prophets intend to expresse some great daunger at hande, they borow the tearme death. Looke a∣fore. 6. d. 8.16. 7. And the shapes of the Crickets vvere like horses prepared to battell: and vppon their heads vvere as it vvere Crovvnes like gold: and their faces vvere as the faces of men. And the shape of the Crickets. G. To the intent all men may ye easlyer beware of such deceyuers: Iohn peinteth them out
once againe in their colours.The fiercenes and outrage of Popish pre∣lates. Like horses prepared to battell. That is to say, they be very ready to quareling, strife, braw∣ling, debate, hatred, & enmitie. M. They are swift in running about, and féerce to feyght. Neither regard they vppon whom they runne, whither it be vpon their elders which charge thē with their abuses, or vppon their yongers, or vpon any other of what state soeuer they be, if so be they perceiue them to impugne their errours. Nay truly, they are not afraide too charge sometime euen the highest princes and magistrates with heresie, to pronounce the sentence of excommunication against them, yea and to make warre vppon them, if they do not by and by banish from them and condemne and perse∣cute such as subscribe not to their doctrine, & sing not Amen vnto euery word of theirs.The passing pride of the po∣pish Clergie. And vppon their heads were as it were Crownes. A.M. Bycause they oftentimes blaze abroade wonderfull victories, against those that fall from their doc∣trine, to the doctrine of the Gospell: (for as many as they can, they put to wonderfull torments, and at lēgth to most cruell death:) they be said to weare crownes vpon their heads. Also they will séeme to be kings and endewed with kingly po∣wer: for they striue to bring all mens heads vnder their gir∣dle, but they themselues wil in no wise be subiect to any mā. In token whereof all their sacrifizing preests and all theyr Monkes are wont to weareshauen. Crownes on their heads, least any man might doubt, that they were not comprehended vn∣der these Crickets, of whome Iohn maketh mention in this place. Neither can any man say he is ignorant of the passing pride of the popish Cleargie, which shall haue weyed theyr presumpteous spéeches any thing néerely, suche as these be, Are we not a kingly préesthood? Can our masters with theyr hoodes erre? Should not the Apostolike sea be alwayes like it selfe?The gaynesse of Papistes is but vayne glorying. So in time past the Pharisies said of Christ: hath any of the noble men or Pharisies beléeued in him? but this mul∣titude which knoweth not the law is accursed. Iohn. 7. g. 49. Like vnto Gold. A. For like as gold excelleth all other metalls:
euen so do they account themselues to surmount all other men in holinesse and knowledge: A. when notwithstanding they be full of all filth and carelesse ignorance of God. G. And therefore their Crownes are not very gold, but onely like gold: bycause their pride wherby they aduance themselues a∣boue all men, is nothing else but vanitie and leasing.The wisdome and meeknesse of the Papists is counterfeit. And their faces were as the faces of men. S.G. By the face, are betoke∣ned skill and wisedome which giue a shew of themselues in the countenance of man. Therfore wheras he saith as it were the faces of men: his méening is, that their wisedome was but counterfet, that is to wit fleshly wisdome, which is foolishnes afore God. M. Moreouer man is a méeke creature as the phi∣losopher witnesseth. Euen so these men shewe themselues méeld, gentle, and méeke in countenance and outward beha∣uiour: howbeit that inwardly they be full of guile and all manner of falsehood, and more crueller than the very wilde beasts. For they come (sayth Christ) in shéepes clothing, but inwardly they be rauening wolues. Math. 7. b. 15. V. Also thys is added, to the intent we should be the more héedefull to be∣ware of them. For they couet not to séeme to be at open en∣mitie with vs: nay rather they will be taken for our shepe∣herds, fathers, and defenders: but they hide their beastly féercenesse vnder manly countenance, and cunningly follow the slynesse of Satan, who transformeth himselfe into an Angell of light, that he may the easlyer deceiue vs. 2. Corin. 11. c. 13.14. Euen so the Mahumetists, Papists, Anabaptists and such like, haue spred their venemous errors ouer all the world, by fawning vpon men with couetous countenance: and therefore we had néede to take very good héede of them. 8. And they had heare on their head as the heare of vvomen, and their teeth vvere as the teeth of Lyons. And they had heare on. &c. M. Héere is noted their effemi∣nate, nice, and vnconstant behauioure: and also héere is
described their leage of single life:The effemi∣nate, nice and vnconstāt be∣hauiour, & the vnspeakable filthinesse of the Papists. for who is he at this daye, that knowes not of their so oftenbragged Sodomie, that is to say, that Romish chastitie of theirs? of whyche, (among o∣ther thinges) Paule speaketh, Rom. 1. d. 26. S. Also they lyue nycely and in idlenesse, as who are forbidden by the Popes decrées to labour with their hands, vnder pretence of a cer∣teine stincking anointing wherof they make so great boast. M. And when they be vrged, both with the ordinance, and also with the example of the Apostle, Act. 20. g. 34. &. 1. Cor. 9. c. 18. &. 2. Thessa. 3. c. 9.10. they answer cuttedly and with a grim looke, that they are not bound to follow the Apostle in thys behalfe. But would God they departed from the example of the Apostle in no mo things than this, and that they assaul∣ted not his sound doctrine so wilfully.The whorish inticement of papistrie. G. Moreouer womans heare is attributed vnto them, bycause that like as harlots entice men to vnlawfull loue by their faire flattering spée∣ches: so these Rakehells vnder pretence of godlinesse, leade away very many from the faith of Christ, and snarle them in their snares by their crafts. M. Of such manner of men the Apostle Paule saith thus: Of this sorte are they that créepe into houses, and leade away sillie women loaden with sinne, which are led with diuers lusts, euer learning, and neuer a∣ble to come too the knowledge of the truth. 2. Timoth. 3. b. 6. And their teeth were as the teeth of Lyons. S. The teeth of Lyons do both teare in péeces, and also haue a ranke smell: whereby is shewed both their féercenesse in working mys∣cheefe vntoo godly men, and also theyr delight to diffame them. And this crueltie, deuouring, and rauenousnesse ap∣péereth manifestly in the popish Cleargie.The crueltie, rauening and slaunderous∣nesse of the po∣pish Clergie. M.S. For lyke as the téeth of Lyons spare no lyuing wyght: euen so shall no godly man lightly scape the téethe of the Sacrifizing preestes and Munkes. But how shuld they spare the quicke, who cannot fynde in their harts to spare the dead? For they plucke their carkeses vnto them, to wrest some gayne euen out of their buryall. To be shorte, they gape so gréedily for
their pray after the manner of Lyons, that they make them∣selues hatefull, stinking, and lothsome vnto God and all god∣ly men. 9. And they had Habergions as it vvere Habergions of yron. And the sounde of their vvings vvas as the noyse of charyots vvhen manie horses runne together too battell. And they had Habergions. &c. S. Hereby it is ment,The wilfull stubbornesse and quarel∣lousnesse of the Papists. that they haue their hartes hardened against the truth. P. For they stick so fast to lying in stead of of truthe: that they thinke they ought in any wise too defende falsehood as if it were faithful∣nesse. And therfore such are described too bée periured in hart, blasphemous in mouth, and reprobate in maners. M. They be alwayes quareling and stirring vp of great disputations a∣geinst their aduersaries, and yet are they destitute of reason. S.G. And wheras their Habergions bée but like Habergions of stéele:The feblenesse of their allega∣tions. it betokeneth that their allegations are not vnuan∣quishable, as they brag them too bée, nor able too holde out a∣geinst the truth of the Gospell: according too thys saying, I will giue you mouth and wisedome, which all your aduersa∣ries shall not be able too geinsay nor withstand, Luke. 21. c. 15. A. Which thing hath bin found in our dayes too bée most true in diuers places where disputations and debatings haue bin had aboute Religion: for then were our aduersaryes eyther presently stricken dumbe or else soone faine too shifte them∣selues away by flight.The wolf bla∣meth the lamb for troubling the water. And the sounde of theyr wings was as the noyse of Chariotes. S.G. He peynteth out lyuely those terrible noyses, wherin they (beyng the Heretikes themselues) thun∣dered out their excommunications ageinst heretikes in their Popishe Bulles: and also the outcryes and brabling dispu∣tations of theyr diuines in the schooles: and moreouer theyr mumbling when they prayed theyr Canonicall houres in their Churches, which is rightly compared to the chirping of Crickets and Gressehoppers as they flie, in as muche as a
man cānot perceiue so much as one sillable what they mum∣ble, thoughe he giue neuer so good eare too them. G. Also they yell out many things in their sermons too the people, ageinst the professers of the Gospell, & belke out many blasphemies. They raile vpon the faithful without measure, & with great statelinesse of mind condemne them as Apostataze and Scis∣matikes. But this iangling is in vaine, and the godly may safely despyze all such. G. Or else by the name of wings héere are descrybed the dubble diligence of these deceyuers,The double-diligence of the Popish decei∣uers. and the continuall inquisitions, informations, persecutions, & slaugh∣ters which these ministers of Baall stirre vp without cessing ageinst the true worshippers of God. For wings doo some∣tymes betoken quickenesse and diligence. Furthermore lyke as birdes are caryed aloft by their winges: euen so these hi∣pocrites houer aloft vpon pretence of riches, dignitie, autho∣ritie, libertie, priuiledges, yea and of Gods woorde by them corrupted: and despyzing all other men, they are so bolde, that they doo what they liste, charging, commaunding, forbid∣ding, and adding precept vppon precept, cursing vpon cur∣sing, and blissing vpon blissing towarde suche as they knowe doo fauour them.The Papists being at oddes among them∣selues, ioyne wholly togi∣ther agaynst Christ. VVhen many horses runne together vnto bat∣tell. Lyke as diuerse Charyotes are haryed dyuers wayes and with diuerse horses vntoo a battell: euen so also these men assaulte the Churche all with one mynde, although with dy∣uers heresyes. And whereas they are almost euer at oddes among themselues: yet too the intent too quenche the lyghte of the Gospell, they agrée too wel, and with one consent make warre against Christ: like as we reade of the Pharisies and Saducies, Math. 22. d. 34. 10. And they haue tayles like the tailes of Scorpions: and there vvere stings in their tailes: and the povver of them vvas to anoy men fyue monethes.
And they haue tailes. &c.Whē Papists pretende most gentlenesse, then meane they most mis∣chiefe. G. The tayle is the hyndermoste parte of them, and betokeneth the ende of them: whyche is ryght deadly and mischéeuous, althoughe they séeme demure and gentle at the first syght. Consider throughly their man∣ner of dealing and theyr deuyses, and thou shalte finde that they neuer meane more mischéefe, than when they are con∣tented too depart wyth somewhat of theyr owne. For when they suffer any of theyr owne inuentions too bée abolyshed, they demaund and looke for farre greater and woorser things at the handes of the Gospellers. M. Besydes this, when they cannot ouercome theyr aduersaryes wyth reason nor wyth the brawling of theyr owne fond and froward doctrine: they séeke the helpe of Princes, whome they bynde vntoo them by flattering and soothing them, too bée gréeuous to the faith∣full, and too persecute them too the deathe. In respect where∣of, there were also stings in the tayles of them. S. That is too say,Their snaring of mens cōsci∣ences by their smooth speech. they leaue an inuenomed sting behynde them, where theyr smoothe spéeche is receyued. Whatsoeuer they doo, saye, or deuyse, it tendeth euermore too vtter vndooyng, and too the gréeuous formenting of the conscience. For they alwayes leaue a man doubtfull of hys saluation. Lyke as when they say that no man is able too knowe certeynely whyther there bée a Sonne of God or no: and that it is ynough if a man be∣léeue as the Churche beléeueth. A thousande suche maner of blasphemies doo they spew oute, too cast snares vpon mens consciences. And the power of them was too anoy menne fyue monethes. A. Sée the fifth verse of this Chapter. Truely Iohn hath in this place set out this monster vnto vs, horrible and vgly, to the intent we should pray earnestly vnto God, too pre∣serue vs from suche a monster, and to deliuer all godly folke from him.
11. And they haue ouer them a King, the Angell of the bottomlesse pitte, vvhose name in Hebrevv is Abaddon, and in Greeke Apollion, [that is too saye a destroyer.] Like reigneth ouer like.And they haue ouer them a Kyng, the Angell. &c. P. God bée∣ing singular good, hathe by secrete (howbeit yet ryghtfull) Iustice permitted a méete Angell too haue the souereintie o∣uer suche men. For of whom soeuer a man is vanquished, hys thrall is he. 2. Peter. 2. d. 19. Therefore the Apostle spea∣kyng of Antichryst, saythe: whose comming is according to the woorking of Satan, wyth all power and lying signes and wonders, and wyth all deceyte of vnryghtuousnesse in them that perish, bycause they receyued not the loue of truth too the ende they myght bée saued. And therefore wyll God sende vntoo them strong illusions, that they maye beléeue lyes, and that all of them maye bée condemned whych haue not beléeued the truth, but consented vntoo iniquitie. 2. Thes. 2. c. 9.10.11.12.The spirite of the diuel is the spirite of Pa∣pistrie. S. We sée then wyth what spirite suche tea∣chers bee ledde, namely wyth the spirite of the Diuell, A. who is a lyer and the father of lying. Iohn. 8. f. 44. Héerevppon Paule the Apostle saythe, The spirite saythe of a certeyn∣tie, that in the latter tymes some shal depart from the faith, gyuing héede too deceytfull spirites and Diuelishe doctryne throughe dissimulation of false speakers, &c. 1. Timo. 4. a. 1. VVhose name in Hebrewe is Abaddon.Abaddon the righte name both of Satan and of the Pope. Abad in Hebrewe sig∣nifyeth too destroye: whereof commeth Abaddon, as yee would say A destroyer, or Destroying. And in Greeke Apollyon. For in Greeke Apollyon signifieth the same that Abaddō doth in Hebrue. The old translater in Latin hath added babens no∣men Exterminans, that is to say in English hauing the name of Destroyer, For Iohn wrate in greeke, and passed for no more but to bée vnderstood of them that knw the gréeke. And yet it must not séeme against reason, that the auncient translater
was desirous to haue the Latin men knowe what Apollyon signifieth, to the ende that all men might beware of Antichri∣stes wyles: A. For this name agrées very fitly vnto Satan, and to Antichrist his sonne. For like as Satan is a murthe∣rer from the beginning, Iohn. 8.44. and vndid all mankynde with his naughtinesse: euen so hathe Antichrist with the ve∣nime of his errours, led away an innumerable multitude of men into deadly, yea and spéedie destruction. In which respect Paule termeth him the childe of perdition. 2. Thes. 2. a. 3. And Christ sayth, A théefe commeth not but to steale, and to mur∣ther, and to destroy. Iohn. 10. b. 10. 12. One vvo is paste, and lo, there come yet tvvo vvoes aftervvarde. One wo is past.What ye three woes betokē. S. The first Wo betokeneth the mischéefe that is brought into the world by the false teachers and cloy∣ster men, which aduaūced Antichrist vnto so great authoritie, A. that he began to bée estéemed for a God and sauiour, when notwithstanding he was but a destroyer and rooter out. And lo, there come yet two woes after this. M. That is to wit, in the opening of the Trumpets of the sixth and seuenth Angels. For the seconde wo is ment of the time wherein Antichrist rageth with most cruell persecutiō agaynst the godly through the whole world. And the third is about the ende and destruc∣tion of Antichrist, A. whome the Lorde shall dispatche wyth the breath of his mouth, & rid quite away through the bright∣nesse of his comming. 2. Thes. 2. b. 8. 13. And the sixth Angell blevv his trumpet: and I heard a voyce from the foure corners of the golden Altar vvhich is before the eyes of God. And the sixth Angel blew. &c. G. This sixth Angel betokeneth all the ministers of Gods worde mentioned in the opening of the sixth seale, héeretofore. 6. d. 12. These are the souldiers of the last skirmishe of all, which detect the craftes of Antichrist
by the truthe of the Gospell. M. For after Iohn hath described the forerunners of Antichrist, and the priuie promoters of his doctrine: now cōsequently in the sounding of this sixth trum∣pet, he describeth Antichrist himselfe and his fauourers, mani∣festly.The foure E∣uangelists, all Martyrs, and true preachers And I heard a voyce from the foure corners of the golden altar. B. That is to say, the agreable preaching of all Gospel∣lers, founded vpon the foure Euangelists, which Euangelists are the foure corners of the goldē altar, that is to say, of Christ offered for vs, & for whom is offered the bloud of all the godly that be persecuted by Antichrist, like as in the olde testament the bloud of ye beasts that were offered in sacrifice, was dipped vpon the foure corners of the altar. And the foure Euange∣lists, & all preachers of the Gospell are termed the foure cor∣ners of the altar, in respect of the faith of the gospel vttered by them to the foure quarters of the worlde, throughe the cléere brightnesse wherof, the crafts of Antichrist are discouered. For if Christes doctrine be once knowne, Antichrist is also knowē by his contrary doctrine: G. according as it befalleth at this day vnto Europe, which béeing wakened by ye voyce of the Gospel hath begon to spie out Antichristes nature, guylfulnesse, and knauerie, and to detest his horrible blasphemies. VVhich is be∣fore the eyes of God. S. He alludeth to the goldē altar in ye Ta∣bernacle, wherby our Lord Christ was prefigured (as hathe bin said alredie) who cā not but be most acceptable to ye father. 14. Saying to the sixth Angell, vvhich had the trum∣pet: let loose the foure Angels vvhich are bound in the great riuer Euphrates. Saying to the sixth Angell. S. This verse doth vs to wit, that Christes kingdome which is spred throughe the foure coastes of the world,The hearts of the wicked are blinded, & they be giuen vp to a reprobate minde. shall be assayled on all sides by the aduersarie powers. Let loose the foure Angels. The foure persecuting An∣gels were forbidden to hurt the sea and the land at their owne lust, vntil the seruants of God were sealed: heretofore. 7. a. 3. Which prohibition is ment to be a binding: and the loozening
of them, is the giuing of them leaue to hurt such as are not sea¦led with the spirite of God in their hearts, according as it is sayd in the. 4. verse. Thus then dothe the Angell speake vnto the Angell. G. After the children of God be signed with ye seale of faith, let the rebels & vnbeléeuers be seduced. They haue set more store by lying than by truthe: therfore let thē credit de∣ceyuers & masters of lying. They haue loued darknesse better than light: therfore let the prince of darknesse reigne ouer thē, and blinded as they bée, let them fall headlong into the pit of damnation. Wherfore, hinder not Gods iustice in this behalf, let them go astray & be vtterly blinded, that they may perishe euerlastingly. What then?In what wise the godly may reioyce at the destruction of the wicked. are the faythfull desirous that the world should be blind? should they not rather call backe them that stray, & bring them into the way of truthe? I answere. Although the faythfull do most desirously wish the welfare of all men, and also (as much as in them lieth) further the same: yet notwithstanding forasmuch as they know it is the right∣full will of God, to withstande the proude and to lift the ab∣iects out of the myre: they can not but reioyce when they sée Gods glory aduaunced in the punishment of their enimies: like as the Prophet was desirous to sée the vengeance whiche the Lorde was about to lay vpon the enimies of his seruants. Iere. 11. c. 20. Dauid also doth more than once aske vengeance of his enimies of Gods hand, not vpon an ildisposed mind, but through the spirit of prophesie, wherby he foresaw the reward that was layde vp for them. A. Concerning whiche thing looke the Psalm. 35. a. 2.3.4.5.6. In the great Riuer Euphrates.The bold and shamelesse fu∣riousnesse of the Papists. S.M. Eu∣phrates is the riuer of Babylon, wherby is signified the force and furiousnesse of the worldly kingdomes stirred vp by the persecuter Antichrist, bering ye chief sway, & by the aduersary powers. And like as Babylō is called ye den of dragōs. Ier. 51. d 37. So this riuer of Babylon is rightly termed the dwelling house or dungeon of Diuels. Wherby also we vndersād, that before the time of Antichrist, they had not so great power and boldnesse to do mischiefe, as is giuen them now a dayes. For
as then they assayled the Church priuilie like a Serpent: but now when Antichrist reigneth, they haue so great power and boldnesse, that they assault the doctrine of the Gospell by the Prelates of the Church, and by such (as to outwarde séeming) are religious, who by vertue of their Apostolicall profession, ought to be defenders of it aboue all others. And therefore Iohn addeth immediatly. 15. And the foure Angels vvere let loose, vvhiche vvere readie for an houre, and a day, and moneth, and a yere, to slea the third part of men. The foure chief stirrers vnto perse∣cution.And the foure Angels were let loose. M. That is to say, all the Diuels dispersed through the foure parts of the world were let loose, with larger commission & power to anoy the Church. S. Also these foure bad Angels may betoken the foure chiefe stirrers of Antichrist to destroy the godly: that is to wit, the Bishops of the highest degrée with the rest of the rulers of the Church, the whole packe of Abbymen, the Vniuersities and Scholes, and the Counsels of Princes. For euen with suche monsters are almost all great Princes Courts pestered, by whome also they bée gouerned.The double diligence of Antichristes disciples. G. In as muche then as these men be bounde by othe to the Bishop of Rome, it commeth to passe by their pricking forwarde, that the Princes who other∣wise are very good, yéeld so much power to the Idol of Rome. VVhiche were readie for an houre, and a day. He meaneth their feruent desire to doo mischiefe, suche as is to be séene in the Papists, who cease not to persecute the Disciples of the Gos∣pell, euen when they them selues be at deathes doore. They say there ought to be no reasoning with heretikes, & that suche as go about to ouerthrow the Popes seate,All thinges come to passe by Gods de∣trminate purpose. doo sinne agaynst the holy Ghost, that is to say, vnpardonably. S. In the meane whyle wee be taught by this place, that nothing is done at aduenture or casually in the whole worlde, but all things depende vpon euerlasting fore-determination, accordyng as Chryste affirmeth, that not so muche as a pretie Spa∣rowe
lighteth vpon the grounde without the heauenly father, Math. 10. c. 29. This manner of spéeche then doth vs too vnder∣stande, that the tymes, dayes, houres, yea and the verie Mo∣mentes wherein all things are doone, are certeinely foreap∣pointed by God. And therwithall, that the doers of them are also foreappointed, and stand in a readinesse at euery moment. And by these wordes he bewrayeth the desyrousnesse and de∣light of malicious féends and wicked mē too worke mischeefe, who notwithstanding can doo nothing further than leaue is graunted them. To slea the third part of men. That is too wit,None shal pe∣rishe but the Reprobates. all the reprobates, and obeyers of Antichrist, which are not sealed with Gods spirit, those shall Antichryst leade out of the way that they may die in their sinnes by the iust iudgement of God. Notwithstanding, there are that referre this thing too the godly, whom Antichryst shall therfore put too death, bi∣cause they haue not receiued his marke. A. But the other ex∣position is the better, and it agréeth to the things that are spo∣ken alreadie in the fourth verse. 16. And the number of horsemen of vvarre vvas tvventie thousande times ten thousand: and I herd the number of them. And the number of Horsemen of warre.Of depending vpon multi∣tude. M. Least any bodye may depend vpon the multitude of men, as though that were euer the best and surest way, he sheweth how ther be a great sort mo vpon Antichrists syde, than vpon Christs side. Twen∣tie thousand times ten thousand. E. That is too say, two Millions of Millions, or twentie thousand Millions. S. For a Million conteyneth tenne thousande. Therefore like as by this figure of spéeche, (bothe in Daniel. 7. c. 10. and also héeretofore in the fifth Chapter and eleuenth verse) there is betokened the ex∣céeding and well néere innumerable multitude of those that waited vpon God: so also in this place is betokened the ex∣céeding great and in manner innumerable multitude of war∣like souldiers that serue vnder Antichrist, in whome he repo∣seth
all his strength and assurednesse.The Papists beeing deuided among them∣selues, ioyne whole togi∣ther agaynst Christ. G. And although that all these bée commonly or rather continually at oddes among themselues: yet notwythstanding when it commeth once to makyng warre ageynst the woorde of the Gospell, they come forth all wyth one mynd too destroy all the godly. And marke howe Iohn mencioneth not héere, that he saw any brydles on the horses heades. Whereby is ment, that the enemyes of the truthe are forced by the spirite of Satan wyth a certeine vnbrydled loocenesse and mischeeuousnesse, so as they shame∣lessely set Princes heartes on fire ageinste the Gospellers. They bleare their eyes with the antiquitie of their decrees, they face them wyth the multitude of their partakers, they al∣ledge the authoritie of their Counsells, and what is it that they doe not too dazle mennes eyes?An exhortatiō to warinesse & stedfastnesse. And I herde the num∣ber of them. Iohn hath added this for ye more certeintie: wher∣by he ment too warne all men too put themselues in a readi∣nesse, too fyght manfully, and too set themselues ageinst the ministers of Satan. M As if he shoulde say, you that fyght a∣geinst Antichrist, it standeth you in hand too bée circumspecte not only bicause the power of the Deuill being now let looce is wexed stronger ageinst the Churche, than it was afore: but also bicause his armie which shal fight ageinst you, is more in∣creased: & this armie is not onely increased, but also is all of horsmē, which are much stronger thā footemen. For like as a horse is better thā any other beast for the battell: so is the Di∣uels host gathered together, not of the rascall sort of mē, but of the peeres of the Church, as of Antichrist the Pope, & of other Bishops, & of such as call themselues religious men. G Yet is there is no cause why the hartes of the faithfull should faile thē for all this multitude of enemies. For although Christes ad∣uersaries were many moe, yet will it come to passe that they shall be made his foote stoole euery one of them. Psal. 110. a. 1. & 1. Cor. 15. c. 25. & Heb. 1. c. 13 and. 2. b. 8. A. And therfore the godly must assure themselues of the victorie. For he that fighteth for them, or rather in them, is greater than he that fyghteh for the
world. 1. Iohn. 4. a. 4. Also euery planting that my heauenly fa∣ther hath not planted, shal be plucked vpon by the roote. Math 15. b. 13. But the rightuous shall shine as the Sunne in ye king∣dome of their father. Math. 13. f. 43. 17. And so I savve the horses in a vision: and they that sat vpon them, had Habergeons of fyre, and of Ia∣cint, and of brimstone: and the heads of the horses were like the heads of Lyons: and out of their mouth vvent fyre, and smoke, and brimstone. And so I saw the horses in a vision. M. He speaketh of the hor∣ses, but yet he dooth first descrybe the ryders of them, saying. And they that sate vpon them had Habergeons of fyre.The mercyles and furious hartes of the papists. S. By these things he betokeneth hard heartes kindled moreouer wyth yre and furie, suche as the armie of Antichryst beareth to∣warde the godly. A. For what is there too bée founde in them but crueltie, wrath, couetousnesse, wrongfull dealyng, malice, and vngodlynesse? And of Iacint.Their spitefull and cankred enuiousnesse, ambition, hi∣pocrisie, coue∣tousnesse, yre, & vitiousnesse. The Iacint resembleth a mynde boyling yea and breathing out the smoke of enuie and spytefulnesse. G. Also by this terme are betokened counterfeit Charitie, Hypocrisie, Couetousnesse, and Ambition: for the Iacint resembleth the faynt colour of the skye. And of Brym∣stone. M. Brimstone betokeneth the nourishment of wrathe and outrage, and also the stinch of vyces and of woorkes con∣trarie too Chryst. Iohn then doth vs too wit, that Antichristes armie is packed togither of mē yt be yreful, lecherous proud, ignorant of ye scriptures, couetous, glutenous, & intangled in all other sins: whervpon foloweth euerlasting punishment, which is continual fire, smoke, & stincke.The terrible∣nesse of Anti∣christs host. And the heades of the horses were like the heads of Lyons. S. By ye riders vpō the hor∣ses he had shewed, that Antichrists host is terrible, & now he sheweth the same by ye horses thēselues. The vse of horses in battell, is to giue spéedie & sodein charge vpō the enemie. And herewithal matcheth féercenesse also, in that they haue heads like Lions: neither wanted they force to anoy, as he sheweth
Moreouer it is too be noted, that in the plague of the Crickets he sawe theyr faces too bée lyke mennes faces: and héere he sées faces lyke Lyons. For the Heretikes, the Disciples and clawbackes of Antichrist,Counterfeite curtesie. pretende some shewe of courtesie: but as for these foresayd Ministers of Antichrist, looke what they teache by sayings and Ceremonies ageynst Christ, that doo they also (as much as in them lyeth) constreyne others first too confesse it: imprisoning, kylling, excommunicating, and chasing away as many as withstande them in defence of the truth of the Gospell. And therefore he addeth. And out of the mouth of them went fyre,The firie ma∣lice, smoke tra¦ditions, & stin∣king fleshli∣nesse of the Papists. and smoke, and Brimstone. S. He sheweth that the verie horses are no lesse armed too the de∣struction of most men, than the ryders themselues. G. In the Popishe constitutions there séemed a whyle to be some shew of equitie and reasonable order. But at length they haue tur∣ned all intoo excessyue crueltie, & are readie with open mouth too deuour as manye as followe the simplicitie of true doc∣trine. And béeyng driuen by the spirite of Satan, they spit out the fyre of malyce, the Smoke of vanitie, and mennes traditions, and the brimstone of stinking fleshlynesse and cursed doctrine. 18. And by these three plagues vvas slaine the thirde part of men, that is to say by fire, smoke, and brimstone vvhich proceeded out of the mouthes of them. And by these three plagues was slaine. &c. A. He meaneth that an excéeding great multitude of men shall be corrupted and slaine with the pestilent poyson of the doctrine of such maner of deceiuers.Such as men be scke is the otrine. VVhich proceeded out of the mouth of them. For∣as much as they haue a corrupt minde and conscience, they bring forth nothing but that whiche is stincking and corrup∣ted. For of the aboundance of the heart the mouth speaketh Math. 21. c. 34.
19. For the povver of them is in their mouthes, and in their tayles. For their tayles are like Serpents, hauing heads: and by these do they anoy. For the power of them is in their mouthes.How the Pa∣pistes hunte with their mouthes. S. They hurt with their mouthes, first by teaching blasphemous doctrine, second∣ly by confirming the same with lying signes, thirdly by lay∣ing heresie too the charge of those that speake ageinst them, finally by thundering out the horrible sentence of excommu∣nication, and lastly by deliuering them vp too the secular po∣wer too bée punished. And in their tailes.The ministers fauourers, dis¦ciples and flat¦terers of An∣tichrist. G. By these tailes are ment the ministers, fauourers, Disciples, and flatterers, of Antichrist. For suche men are woont too bée venemous, and suttle, and they labour by all meanes too hinder the course of the Gospell, according as a man maye sée vnder the Popes dominion, where all men from the most too the least imploy their trauell too quenche the light of the Gospell vtterly. For their tayles are like Serpents. M. That is too say, they be alwayes créeping about, too heape togither worldly goods. Hauing heads q. d. By reason of their riches they are promoted and made iudges and heades of other men. And by these doo they anoy.Who bee the tayles of An∣tichrist. That is too saye, they practise too oppresse the faythfull and godly. For the tayles of Antichrist are the Bishops officialls, Commissaries, Deanes, Registrers, Chauncelers, Proctors, and Sommeners, which are lyke vntoo venemous serpents, poysoning most men wyth theyr lewde examples and doc∣trines, although that in manie likelyhodes they pretend thē∣selues to be pure. 20. And the rest of the men that vvere not slaine by these plagues, repented them not of the vvorke of their handes, that they should not vvorship diuels, and ima∣ges of Golde, and of siluer, and of brasse, and of stone, and of vvoode, vvhich can neyther see, nor heere, nor vvalke.
And the rest of the men &c. M. Thys place may bée expoun∣ded two wayes. First of the infidells who haue not bin sedu∣ced by Antichrist, and yet continue still in the Idolatrie and vanitie that they haue learned of their fathers.False Chri∣stians. And secondly of those which though they cleaue not to the vntoward doctrin of Antichrist, but wil be taken for brothers and Gospellers: yet do they not chaunge their olde behauiour into the better, neyther amend they in dade, the things that they had haun∣ted before they knew Christ: but make Christianitie an oc∣casion of fleshely libertie. Suche are Christians but in tytle onely, for whose sake the name of God is blasphemed among the heathen, and the doctrine of the Gospell is ill spoken of a∣mong the vnskilfull, as thoughe Christ were the minister of sin. Ageinst these writeth Iames at large in the fourtéenth verse of his second Chapter. 21. And they repented them not of their murthers, nor of their vvitchcraftes, nor of their whoredome, nor of their stealing. The ende of our calling is holynesse.And they repented them not of their murthers. A The ende of our calling is, that by walking in newnesse of life, wée should please God through faith. Therfore if a man be in Christ, he is a new creature. 2. Cor. 5. d. 17. Contrariwise if a man haue not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his Rom. 8. b. 9. Then let no man henceforth flatter himselfe for hauing neuer so great knowledge of the Gospel: but let him confesse Christ earnest∣ly, who sayth, not euery one that sayth vnto mée Lord Lorde shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doth the will of my father which is in Heauen. Math. 7. c. 21. And the wil of God is this, euen that we should be holy. 1. Thes. 4. a. 3. that by doyng wll wée might stop the mouthes of foolishe and ignorant men. 1. Petr. 2. c. 15. Too bee shorte, he that knoweth how too doo well and doth it not, is hilde bounde in his sinne. Iames. 4. d. 17.
The tenth Chapter. ANd I savve another mightie Angell come dovvne from heauen, clothed vvith a Cloud, and a Rayn∣bovve vpon his heade, and his face vvas as the Sunne, and his feete as pillers of fyre. ANd I saw another mightie Angel.Christ is al∣wayes present in ayding the faythfull. A. In this place Iohn declareth, that the preaching of the Gos∣pell (the force whereof is knowen too none but too the chosen) must goe before the last iudge∣ment day: and also how the mysteries of Gods worde must bee delt forth faithfully, by those that haue recey∣ued them at the Lordes hand. M. After he hathe set downe a description of Antichrist and his members: least the faithful beeyng discoraged throughe impatience myghte gyue ouer theyr feyghting ageinste Antichrist and hys members: all the godly are heere warranted, that Christes speciall succour is present with them in due season: wyth the consideration of the power whereof, they maye bée comforted spiritually, and made strong ageynst the pestilent opinions, wherewith most men shall bée deceyued. S. Moreouer by the description of thys Angell, it appéereth that he is the Angel of the attone∣ment, the Angell of the Couenant, yea and euen that An∣gell of great wysedome, oure Lorde Iesus Chryst. Whom Iohn dothe therefore call myghtie, bycause it was he that shoulde ayde the godly ageynst the vngodly and cruell op∣pressers. This is that Lord strong and mightie, the lord that is mightie in battell. Psal. 24. c. 8. to whō all the gates or po∣wer of hell must of necessitie giue place. For he is that stout champion and stronghanded Dauid which plucketh ye sword of Golyas out of his hand, and strippeth Satan out of all his armour: during whose protection of the Church,Christes com∣ming down in a cloude. al things are in safetie. Come downe from heauen. Wée knowe that Chryst
shall come downe from heauen to iudge the quicke & the dead, according too the charge committed vntoo hym, lyke as it is written in the Acts, 1. b. 11. and. 3. d. 21. and. 10. g. 42. &. 17. g. 31. and. 24 g. 26. and Phil. 3. d. 20. and. 2. Tim. 4. b. 8. Clothed with a Cloud. According too ye which he sayd too the high Préest & the standers by: Henceforth yée shal sée the sonne of man com∣ming in the cloudes of the aire. Math. 26. f. 64. And there ap∣péered a Cloud vpon the Mountaine when he ascended intoo heauen. Act. 1. b. 9. And a Rainbow vpon his head. M. The Rain∣boweRaynbowe. vpon Christes head signifyeth, that onely for his sake the heauenly father is at one with vs, that is too wit, when wée fasten our eyes vpon him by faith, wherthrough wée bée safe from the wrath to come. Gene. 9. b. 13. and Math. 3. b. 7. & 17. a. 5. and Rom. 1. a. 5. and. 1. Tim. 1. a. 1. and. 1. Iohn. 2. a. 1.2. And his face was as the Sunne. S. Nay rather bryghter than the Sunne.The glory and brightnesse of Christes com∣ming to iudge∣ment. For in as much as among things created nothing is more beautifull and pleasant than the Sunne: the Scrip∣ture is woont too betoken the greatest brightnesse and swéet∣nesse that can bée, by the similitude of the Sunne. Herevpon Zacharie sayde, The dayspring or Ryzer from an hyghe hath visited vs to giue light too them that sit in darknesse and in the shadowe of death. Luke. 1. g. 78.79. A Howbeit lyke as the Sunne is chéerely and leefsome too suche as haue sounde eyes, and contrariwise too such as haue sore eyes: euen so the glorious comming of Christ vnto Iudgement, wyll bring in∣credible comfort too the godly, & strik the vngodly in excéeding feare. S. For he that dooth euill hateth the lyght, Iohn. 3 c. 20. And then will the Lorde bring the things too lyght that were hidden in darkenesse, and disclose the secretes of all hartes. 1. Cor. 4. a. 5. Truth shall put vntruthe too shame. A. By reason wherof, the vngodly (as much as in them lyeth) driue the day of the Lord a great way off: but the godly wishe for Chrystes comming with feruent desire, and long wonderfully for it. 2. Timothie. 4. b. 8. for thus dooth Christ bespeake them: when these things begin too come too passe, looke vp and lift vp your
heades, for your redemption draweth nye. Luke. 21. f. 28. Also, beholde I come shortly, and my rewarde is with mée, to yéelde vnto euery man according to his worke. Hereafter 22. c. 12. Why then are the faythfull afrayde, séeing they haue gotten so mercyfull and fauourable a iudge? He will set them at his righte hande, and call them to the kingdome prepared for thē from the beginning of the world. Math. 25.32. Yea and he will make them sit downe at the table, and he him selfe will go vp and downe and serue them. Luke. 12. e. 37. And his feete as pil∣lers of fyre. S. In pillers is strengthe, in féete is trampling,It is terrible to lighte intoo Gods wrath. and in fire is consuming or wasting. A. Euen so, Christ beeing girded with strength, shall make all his enimies his foote∣stoole, and at length thrust them downe into hell fyre by the seruice of his Angels, wherby wée gather, that it is a dreadful thing to light into his hands. Heb. 10. f. 31. 2. And he had the booke open in his hande: and he set his right foote vpon the Sea, and his lefte foote vpon the Lande. And hee had the booke open in his hande.Christ onely giueth know∣ledge. S. It is only Christ that is able too open the mysteries of the Scriptures vnto such as he vouchsafeth that gifte vpon, according as it is written: Then did he open their wittes, that they might vnderstande the Scriptures. Luke. 24. g. 45. A. And agayne, did not our hart glowe within vs whyle he was talking with vs by the way, and opened the Scriptures vnto vs? Luke. 24. e. 32.The greate knowledge whiche God poureth out in these latter tymes. G. And wheras this booke is now sayde to be open, which héeretofore was shut and sealed: it signifieth, that there shall be greater knowledge of Gods mysteries in these last tymes, than hath béen in former times. Which thing wée sée to bée fulfilled now a dayes, if wée bée not wilfully blinde. For some of the fayth∣full sorte, and specially of the teachers, are euery where so endued with the benefite of Languages, and other gracious gifts of the holy Ghost, that the holy scriptures be handled by them bothe more purely, and with greater edifying, A. than
euer they were afore, sauing the tyme of the Apostles, by whose trauell and ministerie this heauenly and holy treasure is come too our handes. And hee set hys righte foote vpon the Sea.The publi∣shing of the Gospell tho∣rough all Na∣tions. G. Too set the foote, is nothing else but too subdue others vntoo one. S. By this then it is mente, that before the laste iudgement day, the Gospell of Christes kingdome shall take place bothe by Sea and by Lande, and so Christ shall reigne very largely. For lyke as the Apostles béeing at the first as yet somewhat weake, preached onely in Iewry, and after∣warde when they were become stronger, departed from thence to preache a farre off too the Gentiles: (Marke. 16. c. 15. and Act. 13. a. 3.) euen so in these latter dayes, the lighte of the Gospell shined but in a certaine, and those very few places: but at the length it passed into diuers countreys of the world, and dayly beginneth to be preached abroade publikely in euery place, where it séemed to bée buried afore. Welnéere all Ger∣manie hath receyued it.And nowe (thanked bee God) it hea∣reth it more abundantly than euer it dyd. A. Englande heard it for a time, and it bursteth foorth dayly into diuers parts of Fraunce: and yet wée will let passe the Realmes that bée farre distant from vs, and the countreys vnknowne vnto vs, which are inlightened with the beames of this light. G. For like as the knowledge of God came first to the Hebrues, then to the Gréekes, and af∣terwarde to the Latines: Euen so, now (to the ende that the last may be made the first) the holy Gospell of Iesu Christ is reuealed agayne to the Latines, and shal come to the Grekes, and lastly to the Hebrues, that all Israell may be saued. And his left foote vpon the lande. A. Forasmuche as commonly the whole world is wont to be betokened by the termes of Sea, and land: this partition signifieth nothing else, but that Chri∣stes kingdome shall be spred out farre and wide. 3. And he cried out vvith a loude voyce like as vvhen a Lyon roareth: and vvhen he had cryed out, the se∣uen thunders spake their voyces.
And he cryed out. &c.What is ment by Christes roring. S.G. Christ the Lyon of the trybe of Iuda rored for hunger, to pray, bothe vpon the Iewes, and vpon the Gentiles: according to Iacobs prophecie. Ge. 49. b. 9. And in another place it is sayde, The Lorde will roare from out of Sion. Amos. 1. a. 2. Also, when the Lorde roareth, who will not bee afrayde? Amos. 3. b. 8. That is to say, the Lorde God hath spoken, who will not preach? The roaring of the Lion then, is the preaching of the gospel, at the cōmandement of Christ, A. who hath sayd, That which I haue sayd to you in the darke, speake you it in the light: & that which you heare in your eare, preach it vpon the house toppes. Mat. 10. c. 27. Also, preach ye the Gospell vnto all creatures. Mar. 16. c. 15. And, I wil giue yée a mouth and wisdome which. &c. Luk. 21. c. 15. And we reade that vnto Paule it was sayde, Be not afrayde, but speake and spare not, for I am with thée. Act. 18. c. 9. Where∣vpon also Luke reporteth that the Apostles did with greate stoutnesse beare recorde of the resurrection of our Lord Iesus Christ. Act. 4. g. 33 And in another place he writeth, that Felix the president trembled when Paule discoursed of Iustice, and temperance, and of the iudgement to come. Act. 24. g. 26. Also this roaring of the Lion may betoken the terriblenesse, wher∣through the wicked are put in feare at the cōming of Christ. For he will not leaue the contempt of his worde vnpunished, but will poure out his wrath vpon the rebels and stuborne-harted, vntill they be vtterly consumed.Thunder, And when he had cried out. &c. G. He meaneth that there were many preachers of the worde stirred vp, which should with inuincible constancie re∣proue Kings & Princes, cōuince the people of vnbeléefe, & tell the dreadful iudgement of God vnto all men, as well great as small, except they amended all of them betymes.The destruc∣tion of the Ro¦mane Empire. For Thun∣der betokeneth iudgement, rebuking, and terror. Psal. 18. b. 14. &. 29. a. 3. & Esai. 29. b. 6. And in this place Iohn séemeth to giue an inkling (although somewhat priuily) of the destructiō of the Romane Empire which at that time bare the soueraitie: in stead wherof the wickednesse of Mahumet and the Pope
should succéede. Which selfe same thing is betokened by the little horne in Daniell. 7. c. 8. And hée purposed not to write of these matters any openlyer at that time. Like as the Apo∣stle also (in many mens iudgement) wryteth of this matter somewhat darkely and riddlelike. 2. Thes. 2. a. 3. notwithstan∣ding, Lactantius in the .xv. chapter of his .vij. booke of diuine ordinances, writeth the decay of that Empire in expresse words. Which thing wée sée is come to passe at this day: and time the assuredest discouerer of things to come, hath brought this truth to light. 4. And vvhen the seuen Thunders had spoken their voyces, I vvas about too vvrite them: and I heard a voyce from heauen saying vntoo mee, Seale vp the thinges that the seuen Thunders haue spoken, and vvryte them not. God reuealeth his secrets to whom & when he listeth.And when the seuen Thūders. &c. A. Iohn reporteth not what these seuen Thunders spake, bicause he was forbidden by the Angell, saying: Seale vp the things that the seuen Thun∣ders. &c. So also is Daniell cōmaunded to seale vp the things that he had séene in vision concerning the last times, and the kingdome of Antichrist, and to close vp his sayings. Dan. 8. g. 26. wherby we learne that God reuealeth his secrets & iudge∣ments to whom & when he thinketh good. For the worlde is wont to conster all things to the worst. Whervpon it cōmeth to passe, that God hath reserued many things to him selfe, and discloseth them not vnto men aforehand: first by reason of the weaknesse of the Readers, as it is said in Heb. 5. d. 12. Second∣ly, for auoyding the slouthfulnesse of those that are to come: and thirdly, for the contempt and blasphemie of the vnbelée∣uers, according to this saying of our Sauiour, Giue not the thing that is holy vnto dogges, neyther cast yée your pearles before Swyne, least peraduenture these trample them vn∣der their féete. &c. Math. 7. a. 6. Therfore let no man presume to vtter or expounde the thing which the Lorde ment to kéepe
secret to himselfe. Only let vs marke in this place, that the Lord will be aduenged vppon all the despisers of his worde, with horrible punishment: A. according as it is written in. 2. Thessal. 1. c. 8. &. 1. Pet. 4. d. 17. 5. And the Angell vvhome I savv standing vppon the sea and vppon the lande lifted vp his hande vntoo heauen. And the Angell whome &c. G. This prophesie agréeth wyth that whiche is written in Daniel. 12. c. 7. if euery thing bée marked narowly. In Daniel, he that sweareth standeth vpon the Sea: and héere he standeth both vppon Sea, and land. Lifted vp his hand vnto heauen. By this manner of spea∣king, is expressed the manner of swearing.The maner of swearing. And this old Ce∣remonie was very fit to expresse the force and nature of an oth. For by lifting vp our hand to heauenward, we shew that we call God to witnesse, and to vengeance if we be false. A. But great is Christs forbearing towards vs, sith he stic∣keth not to sweare vnto vs to the intent to assure vs of the faithfulnesse of his sayings. So also hath it pleased God to sweare diuers times.Of othes, and in what wise it is lawfull to sweare. Hebr. 6. d. 17. & Gen. 22. c. 16. & Psal. 110. a. 4. &. 132. c. 11. This place feyghteth against the Anabaptists, who grounding thēselues amisse vpō these words of Christ, sweare not at all Math. 5. e. 34. kéepe a great coyle, as though Christ had vtterly forbiddē men to sweare for any maner of cause: whereas his purpose was but to cal them backe again to the right rule of the law. The Iewes had certaine crosse and indirect manner of others, and when they sware by hea∣uen, by earthe, or by the Altar, they counted it almost for a thing of nothing: and according as one vice tolleth on ano∣ther, vnder this coloure, they bare themselues in hande, that they did the lesse dishonor Gods name. This fault of theirs doth Christ encounter, declaring that they must not sweare after this maner or that, as by heauē or by earth. &c. Wher∣by we gather that the percell at all must not bée referred
to the substance of the oth, but to the manner of it: as if he had sayde, ye shall not sweare by this thing or by that thing, directly nor indirectly. For else it had bin superfluous to haue reckened vp the particular kinds of swearing. And therefore the Anabaptists bewray as well their desire of quarelling, as also their grosse ignorance, when they inforce a worde or twayne so waywardly, and ouerpasse the whole substance of ye matter with their eyes shut. A. Also Christ speaketh there of mens dayly businesse, bargaines, and talke, where swearing is not necessary. But in néedefull cases we are not only per∣mitted to sweare, but also commaunded, yea euen of God himselfe. Deutero. 6. b. 13. and. 10. d. 20. We must sweare in truth, iudgement, and righteousnesse as the Prophet saythe. Ieremy.What an othe is. 4. a. 2. For an oth is a holy calling vpon the name of God: and Gods name is taken in vayne mo wayes than by misswearing. C. And therefore we must abstayne from all superfluous licentiousnesse of swearing. For Christs mée∣ning was nothing else but that all othes are vnlawful which dishonor Gods holy and reuerend name by any manner of abuse. But if iust cause require to sweare, we must sweare. B. For if it be to the aduancement of Gods glory, to the assu∣rance of a sound and substantiall truth, or to the weale of our neighbour, then is it lawfull to confirme doubtfull cases with an oth. After this manner did Paule sweare. Rom. 1. b. 9. and. 2. Corin. 1. d. 23. and after the same manner sware Christ Iohn. 5. c. 24.25. and 6.32.53. and in many other places. Also God himselfe sweareth by himselfe. Hebrues. 6. c. 13. and d. 16. Wherefore if we will sweare aright, let vs follow the sober and reuerent dealing that was to be séene in Christe and his Apostles. 6. And he svvare by him that liueth for euer and e∣uer, vvhich created the heauen and the things that are in it, and the earth and the things that are in it, and the Sea and the things that are in it, that there shall be no more time.
And he sware by him. &c. S. Christ sweareth by himselfe, bi∣cause he hath none greater to sweare by: and therewithall al∣so he declareth himselfe to be God, according to this saying, he dyeth not any more. Rom. 6. b. 9. A. And behold I am aliue for euermore. Héeretofore. 1. d. 18. VVhich created heauen. By this he doth vs to wit, that he himselfe is Lord of all thyngs, and hath all these things at his commaundement: like as he saith in another place, All power is giuen vnto me both in heauen and earth. Math. 28. d. 18. That there shall be no more time. G. In the prophesie of Daniel it is written for a tyme, and times, and halfe a time. And when the scattering of the hosts of the holy people is fulfilled, then shall all these thyngs be fulfilled. Dan. 12. c. 7. Some make a reasoning here, about the ceassing of time after ye general iudgement: but that is to no purpose. For in this place Iohn meant nothing else, but ye the Lord sware (yt is to say determined by vnchangeable de∣crée & euerlasting purpose,) that there shall be no more time of persecutiō after ye voyce of the sixth Angel like as afore, bi∣cause Antichrist & al ye wicked shal then be quite done away. 7. But that in the dayes of the voyce of the seuenth Angell, vvhen he beginneth to blovve his trumpet, the mysterie of God shall be finished, according as he hath told vnto his seruants the Prophets. But that in the days.Gods laste iudgement▪ &c. A. In this place is betokened ye time of Gods iudgemēt. The mysterie of God shal be finished. M. That is to wit, the last and generall resurrection, the rewarding of the saincts, and the perfect fulfilling of al the Scriptures. Of which mystery Paul writeth largely. 1. Cor. 15. g. 51. &. 1. The. 4. d. 16. According as he hath tolde to his seruants the Prophetes M. Who doubtlesse haue prophesied of both the commings of ye Lord. Therfore looke how sure we be that ye first is already past: euē so certenly do we know by ye saying of ye Prophets, yt the other is hard at hād. Moreouer we sée héere, how Iohn in this booke writeth things agréeing with ye Prophets. For
he hath reueled the things that concerne the kingdomes as well of Christ our Sauioure as of Antichrist the destroyer, not only to Iohn alone, but also to other holy Prophetes: howbeit that we by reason of our owne dulnesse and the vn∣luckinesse of our age, do in no wise gyue héede vnto them. 8. And I heard a voyce from heauen againe talking vvith me, and saying: Go and take the booke that is o∣pen, out of the hand of the Angell that standeth vppon the sea, and vpon the land. Knowledge must besought at the hands of Gods mi∣nisters.And I herd a voyce. G. Consequently in the person of Iohn, héere is shewed the modestie of the godly, who being not as yet endewed with the true vnderstanding of the scriptures, are counseled to take the booke out of the hand of the Angell: that is to say to séeke the exposition and interpretation of them at ye hands of Christs faithful ministers, whose charge it is to teache and instruct and paciently to beare with the weake, according to the sound iudgement of the scripture: Like as it is written of the préest, The lippes of the Préest shall kéepe knowledge▪ and they shall séeke the law at hys mouth. For he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts. Malach. 2. b. 7. G. As for those that disdaine to demand of the ministers of Gods word, the things that perteine to their owne salua∣tion: they liue like brute beasts, and maliciously despise gods benefyts offered vnto them. Take the booke that is open. A. God quickeneth vp our slownesse, and gently allureth vs too the knowledge of his mysteries: but we must firste acknow∣ledge and confesse our owne weakenesse, before we can bée able to conceyue his sacred mysteries. 9. And I vvent to the Angell, saying vnto him that he should giue me the booke. And he sayd to me, take the booke, and deuoure it: and it vvill make thy belly bitter: but in thy mouth it shall be as svveete as hony.
10. And I tooke the booke at the Angels hande, and deuoured it, and it vvas in my mouth as svveete as ho∣ny: and vvhen I had svvalovved it dovvne, my belly became bitter. And I went to the Angell.All benefites and all good things must be sought for at Christes hand only. A. Iohn refuseth not the benefite that is offered him, he alleageth not his owne worthinesse, he puts no doubt that perchaunce he shal not obteine it: but per∣ceyuing himselfe to be counseled by God, he demaunded the Booke of the Angell. Euen so as ofte as God calleth vs to the partaking of his benefites, wée must reuerently and soberly receyue the things that his fatherly liberalitie offereth vnto vs, except wée will be counted double vnthankfull. Therefore let them sée what answere they can make vnto Christ, who leauing him, do with diuelishe superstition runne vnto dead Saincts, or rather to dumbe stockes and Idols, when they woulde obteyne any benefite. For it is not for noughte that Christ hath sayde, Come vnto mée all yée that labour and are heauie loden, and I will refreshe you. Math. 11. d. 28. Also, he that commeth vnto mée shal not hunger, and he that beléeueth in mée shall not thirst for euer. Iohn. 6. d. 35. Also, if any man thyrst, let him come vnto me and drinke. Iohn. 7. f. 37. If yée aske any thing of the father in my name, hée wyll giue it you. Iohn. 16. c. 23. And S. Iames sayth, If any of you want wis∣dome let him aske it of him that giueth, namely of God, who (I say) giueth too all men fréely without vpbrayding: and it shall bée giuen vnto him. Iames. 1. a. 5. And he sayde vnto mee,God disapoin∣teth not any good petition. take the booke. Like as Iohn durst not demaunde the booke before he was bidden by the Angel: so now béeing cōmaunded and aduised to aske it, he asketh it boldly & obteyneth it, so the intent wée may know that God allureth vs not to deceiue vs. •. Héerevpon are these sayings of Christ, Aske, and yée shall receyue: séeke, and yée shal finde: knocke, and it shall bée ope∣ned vnto you. For euery one that asketh receiueth. &c. Mat. 7. c. 7.8. And deuoure it.To devoure. G. The propertie of the worlde must bée
marked. Too Deuour is to eate with a gréedie appetite, and to digest it hastely in the stomacke. After the same maner wée open the mouth of our will,The right re∣ceyuing of Gods bene∣ites, and spe∣cially of hys word and sa∣craments. to bée made partakers of Christs benefites, and refreshed with spirituall foode. He therefore is said too eate the booke, which beyng bathed with the spirite of God, is able too vnderstand the things that God himself com∣maundeth in his word. But the scripture is not to be ouerpas∣sed or auerred slightly, neyther is it too bée credited onely as a bare storie: but it must be written in the bottome of the hart and in the verie bowells, so as it maye not lyghtly slip oute, or bée quenched in vs. Iohn then is willed too reade, consider, and vnderstand it aduisedly, and to lay it vp déepely in his mynd.The force of Gods worde in the mindes of the fayth∣full. The like thing haue wée in Ezechiel. 3. a. 1.2.3. And it will make thy belly bitter: but in thy mouth. &c. P. That is too say, when thou shalt haue receiued it, thou shalt bée delyghted with the sweetnesse of the heauenly woord and hope of the pro∣mised saluation, and with the pleasantnesse of the heauenly ryghteousnesse: but at length thou shalte finde bitternesse, when thou beginnest too preache the same vnto others. S. Thē is there expressed héere the nature and force of Gods woorde in the myndes of the godly. For vntoo the godly it is swéete and sauery as honnie, according too thys saying, howe swéete are thy sayings too my throte. &c. Psal. 119.103. Neuerthelesse like as honnie or mede maketh ones belley too swell, and see∣keth way out ageine: euen so Gods woord being well weyed and vnderstoode, breaketh vpward, and cannot bée hild down. Héere vpon the Prophete saythe, My hart breaketh out intoo a good matter. Psalm. 45. a. 1. Also, I haue beleeued, and ther∣fore haue I spoken, Psalm. 116. b. 10. Also, wée beléeue, and therefore doo wee speake. 2. Corin. 4. c. 13. So did Elihu also complaine of the aking or swelling of his belley by reason of Gods worde which he had receiued, Iob. 32. d. 18.19. And lyke∣wise Ieremie. 4. e. 19. Also Paule, wo is to me, (saith he) if I preach not the Gospel. 1. Cor. 9. c. 16. Also it maketh the hartes of the godly to irne, when they sée it despised and blasphemed:
lyke as Dauid saith, It irked mée to sée the transgressers, by∣cause they kepte not thy sayings. Psal. 119.158. And likewyse when persecutions are layde vpon men for the word. A. For all that wyll lyue godlily in Chryst Iesu, must suffer persecu∣tion. 2. Timo. 3. c. 12. Nowe if sundrie persecutions lyght vp∣on all those that loue and follow Gods word: how much more shall they light vpon them that teache others, and vpon the ministers of the verie word? Herevpon Christ sayde to his Disciples. Séeyng they haue persecuted mée, they will also persecute you, Iohn. 15. c. 20.Obedience to Gods com∣maundement. And I tooke the booke at the An∣gells hand. A. Iohn obeyeth the counsell of the Angell, for he ta∣keth the booke and deuoureth it: that is to say, he marketh ad∣uisedly what the Lorde willeth him to doo. And it was in my mouth as sweete as honnie. For the darker that any prophesie is, so muche the pleasanter is the meaning of it when it is manifestly opened. And when I had swalowed it downe. &c. A. Sée the verse going afore. 11. And he saide vnto mee. Thou must prophesie a∣gein among many people, Nations, & tungs, & kings. And he saide vnto mee, Thou must prophesie agein.God calleth vpon his mi∣nisters conti∣nually to go through with their charge. A. What giftes so euer the Pastours and ministers of Gods worde re∣ceyue, the same must also serue other mennes turnes. In re∣specte whereof Christes ministers are called the Stewardes or dealers foorthe of Gods secretes. 1. Corin. 4. a. 1. Iohn ther∣fore is in this place commaunded, too bende hys mynd stout∣ly and lustely too the preachyng of the Gospell. And by the percell Ageyne, wée gather, that this holye man had alrea∣die imployed his trauell in the same charge. Notwithstan∣dyng for as much as the weakenesse of our fleshe is great: it must not séeme strange, though he bée eftsoone by this cōman∣demēt put in mind to go through with his race chéerfully, for truely he had sene and herd manie things, which woulde not please a great sort, and specially the great men of this world. Wherefore too the ende he might lay aside all feare of men, and fulfill hys duetie stedfastly and vnfearfully, he is put in
minde of it by God. After the same maner Esay and Paul béeing alreadie called to the ministerie of Gods word, are con∣firmed with new visions and commaundements. Esai. 6. b. 9. and Act. 18. b. 9. Among many people, nations, toungs, and kinges. M. q. d.Who be able ministers. Séeing that this prophecie so declared against Antichrist shal be spred abrode, and the fame therof heard of al the kings of the earth: sée that thou neuer giue ouer the charge of prea∣ching agaynst Antichrist enioyned vnto thée, neyther for the bitternesse of any persecution, no nor euen for death. It is to be marked héere, that no man is méete for the office of prophecy∣ing or preaching Gods worde, sauing he whome the Lord cal∣leth, and to whome he hath deliuered the booke: that is to say, whome he hath decked with gifts necessarie to teache. Wher∣vpon Paule intreating of the same matter, sayth: Such trust haue wée through Christ to Godwarde, not that wée be suffi∣cient of our selues to thinke any thing as of our selues, but our hablenesse commeth of God, who hath made vs able to mini∣ster the newe Testament, not of the letter, but of the spi∣rite. 2. Cor. 3. a. 4. For in that place he speaketh of his owne seruice doone to the Corinthians, whō by his preaching he had made the Epistle of Christ, written in their hearts by the holy Ghost, that is to say, he had made them true Christians. G. For it is required in all teachers of the Church, that they be sent of God, to the intente that the authoritie of teaching be not grounded elsewhere than vpon God alone. For it is God that worketh all in all men by his spirite. 1. Corinth. 12. a. 6. Sée∣ing then that neuer any man can of him selfe become a pure and fitte minister of the Gospell, and that none other doo rightly discharge the office of teaching, than suche as the Lord rayseth vp, and furnisheth with the giftes of his spirite: as ofte as wee see any scarsitie of good preachers, wée muste lyste vp our eyes too the Lorde of the Haruest, and desire him too thrust foorth workmen into his haruest. Math. 9. e. 38. For how shall they preache vnlesse they bée sente. Roma. 10. c. 15. •V. And doubtlesse the prayers of the faythfull shall not bée
vnprofitable and superfluous as some lewde persons ima∣gine, who beare themselues in hand, that all things are done by Gods absolute power, without any respect or regarde of our prayers. Woorthily also shall the vngodly perish, which preferre slouthfull shepherdes before such as bee painfull, or which loue flatterers and turne away their eares from gods truth, vnto the heering of fables. 2. Tim. 4. a. 4. The eleuenth Chapter. ANd there vvas giuen vntoo mee a Reede lyke a rod, and it vvas saide vntoo mee, Vp, and mea∣sure the Temple of God, and the Alter, and those that vvorship therin. ANd there was giuē vnto me.The truthe of Gods Gospell shall alwayes get the vpper hande. A. Bicause heretiks & Hypocrites shal bée disproued by the prea∣ching of Gods woorde. Antichryst shall stirre vp excéedyng sore persecutions ageinst the godly in the latter tymes: in so muche as there shall bée verie greate scarcitie of good Shepherdes in comparison of the deceyuers and flatterers of Antichrist. Neuerthelesse, althoughe the Tyrantes seeke all the wayes too the wood too make cleane riddance of the de∣uout woorshippers of God: yet shall the truthe of the Gospel alwayes get the vpper hande: by reason whereof the elect of God shall continually magnifie the Lorde, whereas the Re∣probates shall bée consumed wyth the rigor of Gods Iustice. A Reede lyke a rod.Of measuring or meating the Church. G After that Iohn is instructed how great the force of Gods woorde is: commission is gyuen him too vewe, iudge, and discerne the Churche, whiche is the verye Temple of God: accordyng too the doctrine of Paule who saythe, The temple of God is holie, whiche is you. 1. Corin∣thians. 3. d. 17. and. 2. Corin. 6. d. 16. And first it is too bée con∣sidered
that as ofte as the Lord purposeth too shewe his gra∣tious goodnesse towardes any Citie, he is wont to commaund his seruauntes to measure it after the maner of them that in∣tend too réere some building. Ezech. 40. a. 5. & Zach. 1. d 16. &. 2. a. 1.2. &. hereafter. 21. d. 12. After this manner dooth he bid Iohn measure his Church: meaning that it shall no where be left vp too the enemyes, although it be diuerse wayes troubled by them. And secondly, this measuring of the Church that ensu∣eth, doth vs to wit, that the Ceremoniall seruice of Moses Lawe must bée abolished out of hand, and a newe one ordey∣ned, that is too wit, such a one as shall consiste in spirite and truthe. For the Lord séemes héere too build a certeyne newe Temple and a newe Ierusalem. Therefore by the name of Temple is rightly vnderstoode the Churche, whych the faith∣full Ministers of Christ must measure by laying the rule of Gods woord vntoo it, aduisedly considering whither any thing bée done in it, whiche is not correspondent too Gods truthe. For all that beareth the name of Religion, is not by and by true and pure Religion: for it is certeyne that Antichristes spring euen out of the middes of the Churche, and sit-in the Temple of God. 2. Thess. 2. b. 4. These are betokened by the name of the Quyre. as wée shall sée in the next verse. S.G. And the true Churche must bée measured according too the heigth of fayth, length of hope, bredth of Charitie which extendeth it selfe to all men wythout exception, and déepth of hir lowly∣nesse where through it humbleth it selfe vntoo all men, yea euen vnto the vylest sinners, after the example of Christ. And the Alter.The triall of the true ser∣uice in th Church. By the name of Alter some vnderstande Christe: of whom the Apostle speaketh too the Hebrewes. 13. b. 10. But more ryghtly doo others vnderstand the seruice of God, lyke as it is taken for the whole seruice of God in manie places of the Scripture, by putting the parte for the whole. Then are the ministers commaunded too consider throughly, whither the seruice of God bee true or counterfeit which they folowe that boaste themselues too bée Christians. For wée sée the
Papistes glorie woonderously of the lawfull seruing of God, by reason they haue learned their seruice of their forefathers. But the rule of Gods woorde shoulde haue beene layde vntoo it, that the lawfull seruice myght haue beene discerned from the counterfeit, which thing their great maliciousnesse and wilfull frowardnesse will in no wyse suffer too bée done. And those that worship therein.Of discerning true worship∣pers fo false worshippers. For as much as there hath alwayes béen great store of Hypocrites in the worlde, and the chosen were neuer without reprobates intermedled among them. It is the duetie of the Pastour, too put a difference betwixte them as néere as maye bée, so as he gently feede, incorage, comfort, and cherishe the true worshippers of God with the foode of his worde: and cyte the residue vntoo Gods iudge∣ment seate, foretelling them of their vtter damnation, not in his owne name, but in Gods: and also deale in suche wyse, that the vngodly (when they bewray themselues to be vtter rebelles) may bée hild short by publike authoritie, and caste out of the companie of all other men: according as is added immediatly. 2. And the Quire vvhich is vvithin the Temple, cast out and meete it not: for it is giuen vntoo the Heathen, and they shall treade the holie Citie vnder foote tvvo and fortie Monethes. And in the Quire. &c. E.AVG. Some Gréeke copyes haue.Heretikes and Hypocrites. And the porche that is without the temple, cast thou out: and manie interpreters haue followed this translation, howbeit that the other seemeth to agrée better. For the other doth vs too wit, ye heretikes & hypocrites are not of the basest sort of mē, but are counted as cheefe members of ye Church: like as wée haue thē betokened by the Starre which Iohn sawe falling from hea∣uen, héeretofore. 8.10. S. But if any man lyke better of the o∣ther translation, the meanyng wyll bee, that Heretikes and Hypocrites are without the Churche and not of the Church, albeit that they séeme too bée in the Church: accordyng too
this text, They went out from among vs, but they were not of vs: for had they béene of vs, doubtlesse they would haue a∣bidden with vs. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 19. For in as much as they bee vt∣terly without the true beléefe in God the father and in our sa∣uiour and Mediator Iesu Christ: they are neuer a whit bet∣ter than the heathē, although that outwardly they communi∣cate with the children of God both in name & Sacraments, according as it is manifest by Mat. 7. c. 22. &. 13. d. 30. &. 22. a. 14. &. 25. c. 32. Therfore cast them out which are out alreadie: that is too say, proue them too bée gone out alreadie, and that they belong nothing at all too the bodie of Christ. A. For Chryst is not plucked from his owne spirit. Wherefore if a man haue not Christs spirit,No regard to be had of the reprobates. he is none of his. Rom. 8. b. 9. And meete it not. That is too saye, comprise them not within the Lordes spiritual building, which can neuer decay, bycause ye woorker & mainteyner therof is euerlasting. Also he doth vs too wyt, that there is no regarde too bée had of the reprobates, but for the electes sakes: lyke as Chryst sayde of the Pharisies, Euerie planting which my heauenly father hath not planted shal bée plucked vp by the roote. Let them alone, they be blind guydes of the blynd, Math. 15. b. 13.14. Also, gyue not the thing that is holie, vntoo dogges. Neyther cast your pearles before Swyne, least perchaunce these trample them vnder foote, and the other turne vpon you and teare you in péeces. Math. 7. a. 6. For it is giuen vntoo the heathen.A description of the pillers of the Popish Church. M. That is too say, for they are become in all poyntes lyke vntoo the vnbeléeuing Paynims, or rather are become woorse than they, how great a countenance of holynesse so euer they beare too the world∣ward. For they bée gyuen vp too a reprobate mynde, they haue a heathenishe, misbeléeuing, and Turkishe hart, G. and a harte inflamed wyth the hatred of Gods woord, they be god∣lesse, lawlesse, Couenantlesse, straungers from the Religi∣on of God, and from the mynding of heauenly matters. Suche are the pyllers of the Popishe Churche, their By∣shops, Maisters, and Doctours, who when they bée con∣uicted
to be Antichrists by Gods word, do let go all know∣ledge of God, and turning vnto horrible woodnesse, execute tyrannie against all the godly, according as is added imme∣diatly. And they shall treade the holy Citie vnder foote.The persecu∣tion of the Church by the wicked. S. Some refer this to the earthly Ierusalem, whereof Daniel spea∣keth. 9. g. 26. And whereof Christe saithe in the Gospell, They shall fall vpon the edge of the sword, and be led away prisoners into all nations: and Ierusalem shall be troden vnder foote of the Gentiles, vntill the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. Luke. 21. e. 24. All which things Iosephus repor∣teth to haue happened to the Citie of Ierusalem and to the Iewish nation: But it appéereth that Iohn had a further re∣spect, and that he hath comprehended the whole calamitie of both the Ierusalems by reason of a certaine neyborhood that is betwixt them, and specially the calamities of the last times vnder the reigne of Antichriste, wherein we sée the Church to be oppressed with wonderfull tyrannie, and tro∣den vnder foote by those which ought by all meanes to main∣teyne it and defend it from enimies. For who knowes not that the Bishop of Rome, the Cardinalls, Bishops, Abbots, Monks, Canons and suche other Sacrifizers, haue conspi∣red with one consente agaynste the true Church of Christ? who sées not theyr trayterous boldnesse? or who is igno∣raunte of their practises agaynst the Gospellers? But Iohn putteth it in for a comforte, that the Church shall suffer and be troden downe by the wicked.Of the ende of Antichrist, and of his cruell persecutions. Two and fortie Moonethes That is to saye, as long as the reigne of Antichrist shall endure, euen till the abhomination of desolation come to an end, and the chylde of perdition be discouered, who shall then fynally be quite destroyed, when Christs king∣dome shall be throughly stablished. For Antichrist began the mysterie of iniquitie, euen already in the time of the A∣postles, according as Paule teacheth. 2. Thessalo. 2. b 7. Neyther hathe he ceassed since that tyme: nay rather he will neuer cease, till he come to his full measure. Yet not∣withstanding,
in the meane while the faithfull are out of all doubt, that Antichrist and his members shall be destroyed, although no man be able precisely to foreset the very time of his destruction. G. Truly Iohn alludeth to the time that is mentioned in Daniel. 12. c. 7. A. For thrée yéeres and a halfe make two and fortie moonethes. M. But it is not for any of vs (vnlesse perhaps he be taught by spirituall and speciall reue∣lation) to attempt to foreset the certaine time, least Christe send him away with his Apostles to learne soberer wit, and it be said vnto vs, B. It is not for you to know the times and instants which the father hath reserued to his owne power. Act. 1. a. 7. And againe, no man knoweth of that day and time, no not the Angells that are in heauen, nor the sonne hym∣selfe, but only the father. Mark. 13. d. 32. S. By the way it is too be noted, first that Antichrists persecution shall be so cruell in the latter times, that all other may séeme nothing in com∣parison of that. For iniquitie shall abound so sore, that there shall no faithfulnesse appéere almost any where, and charitie shall be key cold in many. Math. 24. a. 12. & Luke. 18. b. 8. And secondly that the same time of persecution shall be but shorte in comparison of Christs reigne which is endlesse. In consi∣deration whereof, the Apostle sayth, the short continuance of our light affliction, doth wonderfully purchace vnto vs an euerlasting weight of glory aboue measure, whyle we looke not at the thyngs that are séene, but at the things that are not séene. For the things that are séene, last but for a time: but the things that are not séene, are euerlasting. 2. Cor. 4. d. 17.18. And Peter said, wherein ye reioyce, being now afflic∣ted for a short time in diuers trials, if néede be. &c. 1. Peter. 1. a. 6. Therefore it is to be noted, that in this place like as in many other, the number certaine is put for a number vn∣certaine. For the persecutions of Antichrist shall continue euen to the last iudgement day.
3. And I vvil giue vnto my two vvitnesses, and they shall prophesie a thousand tvvo hundred and threescore days, clothed in Sakcloth. And I will giue.The fewnesse of sound prea∣chers in the latter tymes of Antichrist, & the strength that God gi∣ueth vnto thē. &c. S. By these words he sheweth the few∣nesse of those that shall preach the Gospell sincerely at that time, in comparison of the false prophets that shall geinesay the purenesse and simplicitie of the Gospell: and yet that they shall not be so few, but that they shall be ynow to disproue their aduersaries of vntruth, by the law: according whervn∣to euery word standeth in the witnesse of two or thrée. Deu. 17. b. 6. &. 19. d. 15. Likewise also as the two true witnesses, were to be preferred before the many false witnesses which had searched out the land of promis togither. Numb. 13. g. 31.32.33. M. But there are whyche by these two witnesses vn∣derstande, that Enoch and Elias shall bée sense of God against Antichrist. But this may be layd vp among the fa∣bles of the Iewes. S. The setting downe but of two witnes∣ses by name, is to giue an incling of the fewnesse of true preachers in the time of Antichrists persecution, when fayth shall fayle and charitie become colde: In care as if it were saide, there shall not bée past one or two: like as in olde tyme in the dayes of Elias and Micheas, the num∣ber of false Prophets was excéeding greate: but as for the true Prophets of the Lorde, scarse one or two came a∣broade, that durst set themselues agaynste the generall wickednesse. And whereas he sayth, I wyll giue, he taketh away from them all carefulnesse and perplexitie of fore∣casting what to do: according to thys text, I wyll gyue you a mouth and wysedome whych all your aduersaries shall not be able to gainsay nor withstand, Luke. 21. c. 15. And they shall prophesie. A. ProphesyingProphecying is taken sometime for the opening and expounding of the scriptures, specially in the newe Testamente: in whyche sence it is taken in thys place, and also in the .1. Corin. 14. a. 3. A thousand
two hundred and threescore days.The earnest∣nesse and good successe of the true preachers agaynst Anti∣christ. S. That is to saye, as long as Antichrist reigneth, and as lōg as his persecuting endureth, so long shall they preach, discouering his crafts and deceits out of the bowels of the scriptures, that the chozen may not be seduced by his false Prophets. M. Wherein is noted the zeale that these preachers againste Antichriste, do beare to∣wards the doctrine of the gospell. For like as in Israell, the more that Idolatrie waxed strong, and the whoter that the displeasure of wicked Iezabell burned against the true pro∣phets of the Lord, so much the earnestlier did Elias preache, and so muche the stoutlyer did he procure the destruction of Baals préestes: Euen so the true preachers of the Gospell, the more that Antichrists displeasure rageth against them, so much the earnestlyer do they labour the destruction of him and all his fauorers by writing, preaching, and teaching. And the time that is set downe heere, sheweth that the perse∣cution of Antichrist shall last but a short whyle, in the same sence that we spake of in the laste verse afore. Clothed in Sakcloth.The apparell of ministers, & their contempt of worldlye things. M.S. That is to say, in course and homely apparell, suche as becommeth the preachers of repentance. Suche as was the apparell of the Niniuites in Ionas. 3. b. 5. And of Elias. 4. Kings. 1. b. 8. And of Iohn Baptist. Math 3. a. 4. And this seemeth to be spoken by matching of contraries. For in the dayes of Elias, the false prophets liued in the kings Courte, in fyne apparell, and féeding of the kings table: when in the meane whyle Elias and Eliseus wandering in the mountaines, and being clothed in sakcloth, bewayled the sinnes of the people. 3. Kings. 19. a. 4. Moreouer Christe had his disciples whome he sent to preach the Gospell, that they should not be carefull for foode and rayment. Math. 10. a. 9.10. and Luke. 10. a. 4. In lykewise writeth Paule to his sonne Timothie: If we haue wherewith to féede and to couer vs (saith he) let vs be contented. 1. Timo. 6. b. 8. Furthermore sith the true preachers looke euery minute of an houre to be caried to punishment as sheepe appoynted to the slaugh∣ter:
there is no reason why they shoulde so muche as once thinke of hauing the goodes of this world, A. sauing so muche as present néede requireth. For this place chargeth not all ministers of the word to aray themselues in sakcloth, when they shall preach the doctrine of the Gospell: but for asmuch as by this phrase of spéech, the scripture is wont to betoken the neglecting of apparell and other outward things, and al∣so sadnesse of minde: Iohns méening is nothing else, but that the true messengers of Christe, haue no regard at all of the thyngs of thys worlde, but preach the word of truth stoutly vntoo all men, bewayling the miserable blyndnesse of them whome Antichrist shall beguile, or whyche béeing touched not with any féeling of sinne, hold skorne to repent. Of which matter thou hast an Example in Paule. 2. Cor. 12. g. 17.18.19.20. &. Philip. 3. d. 18.19. 4. These are tvvo Oliue trees, and tvvo Candle∣sticks, standing in the sight of the God of the earth. These are two Oliue trees, and two Candlestickes.True prea∣chers likened to Olif trees and candle∣stickes. A. These two titles agrée very trimly to Christs faithfull messēgers. S. First they be called Oliue trées, by reason of the pure doc∣trine of Christs spirit, which they drop out continually to the enlightning of his Churche: And he alludeth to the place of Zacharie. 4. d. 11. G. Or else for their good frutes whiche they bring foorth to the profit of the Church. B. Agayne they be cal∣led Candlestickes, S. bycause that by their seruis, the light of truth shineth in many mens harts, and driueth away the darknesse of Antichrists errors. A. In whiche respecte also Christ calleth them the light of the world. Math. 5. b. 14. Also, We haue (saith Peter) a right sure word of prophesie, wher∣vnto if ye take héede as vnto a light that shineth in a darke place, ye do well vntill the day dawne, and the day Starre arise in your harts. 2. Peter. 1. d. 19. standing in the sight of th God of the earth. That is to saye, acceptable to God, and al∣ways ready to do his will.
5. And if any man vvill hurt them, fyre goeth out of the mouths of them, vvhiche deuoureth their eni∣mies: and if any man vvill do them harme, thus must he be killed. And if any man will hurt them. A. A threatning againste the persecutorsA threatning agaynst the persecuters. of Gods word: as if he shoulde say, the worde of truth, which the aduersaries are not able to resist but by vio∣lence, burneth their consciences, so as in the meane whyle they themselues endure a greater and sorer fyre, than they do whome they haue put to the stake to be broyled with bodi∣ly flames. He alludeth to the story of Elias. 4 Kings. 1. b. 10. G. Thē must ye ministers of gods word be alwais armed with the sword of ye spirit, (that is to say with the word of ye Lord which is sharper thā any twoedged sword) yt they may resist their enimies with a stout courage. For the weapons of our warfare (sayth S. Paule) are not fleshly but mighty to God∣ward, to ye casting downe of strōg holds, wherwith we ouer∣throw imaginations & euery highnesse yt is lifted vp against the knowledge of God, & we leade all vnderstanding captiue vnto the obedience of Christ. 2. Cor. 10.4.5. S. The fleshly wea∣ponsFleshly wea∣pons. are riches, honor, power, eloquēce, great traynes of ser∣uants, great store of friends and alies, horsemē, chariots, and al maner of warlike furniture, such as Pharao had when he pursued the Israelites. Exod. 14. b. 6. & such as Saule had whē he persecuted Dauid. 1. Kings. 8. c. 11. Whervpō the holy pro∣phet Dauid sayd, These put their trust in chariots & horses, but we wil cal vpō the name of the Lord our God. Psal. 20. b 8. But the ghostly or spiritual weaponsSpirituall weapons. are truth, righteous∣nesse, good tidings of peace, faith, praier, supplication, perse∣uerance, watchfulnesse, and the word of God. Eph. 6. c. 14.15.16.17.18. These be the artillerie wherewith they must beate downe the strōg holds, not of townes, castles, towers, or bul∣warks: but of wicked imaginations, thoughts & desires, and worldly wisdome. These be the weapons wherewith they
must fight, not against flesh & bloud, but against rule, against power, & against the worldly rulers of the darknesse of thys world, againste spirituall wickednesse for heauenly thyngs. Eph. 6. b. 12. Finally, these are the weapons wherewith they must fight against al vngodlinesse & whatsoeuer is not allo∣wable by ye holy scripture, as errors, heresies, felonies, trea∣sons, Idolatries, whoredoms, robberies, rapes, slaughters, murthers, thefts, incests, ambition, tyrannie, vserie, crueltie, and such other like. And if any man wil do them harme. M. That is to wit, by sleaing them bodily, or by persecuting thē, or else by slaundering and backbiting them. Thus must he be killed. S. That is to saye, by some like punishment from heauen. A. Héere vnto perteineth that which Christe said to his disci∣ples, whatsoeuer ye binde vpon earth shall be bound also in heauen. Math. 18 c. 18. And againe, whose sinnes soeuer you withhold, they are withhild. Iohn. 20. e. 23. 6. These haue povver to shut vp heauē, that it may not raign in the dais of their prophesying: & they haue power ouer the waters, to turn thē into blud, & to strike the earth vvith all manner of plagues, as oft as they list. These haue power. &c. G. It is to be marked héere,Of the punish¦ment of the wicked, and of their slaunde∣rous imputing the same to Gods word. yt the ex∣ample of Elias is still set foorth in this place to the ministers of gods word, whom it becōmeth to do their seruice in prea∣ching of ye Gospel, in the power & spirit of Elias. For ye spiit of Elias is takē for a liuely, effectuall, and full zeale of Gods glory. A. So is it said of Iohn Baptist, And he shall go before him with the spirit and power of Elias, to turne the harts of ye fathers to their children, & the disobedient to the obedience of the righteous, that he may prepare a perfect people to the Lord. Luk. 1. b. 17. G.S. Elias perceiuing the vnkindnesse of A∣chab, said and sware: As truly as the Lord God of Israell ly∣ueth, in whose presence I stand, if there be in these yéeres ey∣ther deaw or rayne, but according to the wordes of my mouth▪ 1. Kings. 17. a. 1. S. So in the tyme that the Gospell is
preached and put backe, a man may sée there is great dearth of vittells and scarcitie of many things in diuers places, wherof the vngodly do father the cause vppon the preaching of the Gospell, and the neglecting of the Antichristian wor∣shipping: like as they did also in Ieremy. 44. d. 15. and as the heathen did, who thought that al the miseries which happe∣ned in old time, from time to time were sent by the displea∣sure of their Gods for the bringing in of the Christian Reli∣gion, & for forsaking the seruis of them. They therfore which at this day suppose ye preaching of ye Gospel, to be the cause of the euils that light vpon them, deale in likewise as if a man shoulde impute ye drowning of the world to the preaching of Noe, or the burning of Sodom to the exhortation of Lot, or the plaging of Egypt to the demaund of Moyses and Aaron, or the captiuitie of the Iewes to the continuall warnings & rebukings of the Prophets, or ye destruction of Ierusalem to the doctrine of our Sauiour & his Apostles, and not rather to the wilfull stubbornesse of the wicked, & to the contempte of Gods word.What is ment by shutting vp of heauen. G. Also to shut vp heauen is to beréeue men of the foode of Gods word: which thing Luke auoucheth Paule and Barnabas to haue done to the Iewes: it became vs (sayde they) to speake the word of God first vnto you: but for asmuch as ye refuse it. &c. Act. 13. g, 46. Therefore the ministers of th word do then shut vp the kingdome of God, eyther whē they suffer the people to folow their owne inuentions for theyr vnthankfulnesse sake, or when they hold out the wicked e∣nimies of the truth from the company of the faithfull. That it may not raigne in the dayes.The likening of Gods word vnto rayne. &c. M. That is to saye, that the pure doctrine of the Gospell may not be preached commonly: which notwithstanding would be very néedfull, by reason of the innumerable wiles of Antichrist. Looke vpō the. 2. Tim. 4. a. 2.3 4.5. G. Moreouer the preaching of Gods word is like∣ned vnto raine, bicause it moysteth mens harts which else are drie and barrein, to the intent they may beare spiri∣tuall fte. Therefore when such preaching ceasseth, and
no man shreddeth, dresseth, and tendeth the Lordes vineyarde, what can it bring foorth but briers, thornes, and wild grapes, that is to say, sinne, vnrighteousnesse, and contempt of God? according as it is sayde by the Prophet Esay▪ 5. b. 5.6.7. and Hebr. 6. b. 7.8. And they haue power ouer the waters,Turning o water into bloud. too turne them. &c. S. This is one of the plagues wherwith the Lorde strake Egypt for kéeping backe his people by force. Exod. 7. d. 20. And this is done as oft as God for the contempte of hys worde, and for mens wickednesse, eyther altogither denyeth the seasonable raynes (that is to wit, the morning and the euening shoures) whiche he promiseth in his lawe to those that serue him: or else sendeth them out of season, so as they not onely be not wholsome to the fruites of the earth, but also pestilent to them. So is it also when the rage of ouerflowing riuers wasteth the pasture and corne in the fieldes. Which thing our dayes haue now oftentimes felte, and yet we wyll say nothing of the ordinarie & right great slaughters of men, whose bloud hathe sometimes dyed running streames red. A. And yet for all this, there is almost no man that considereth earnestly these dreadfull iudgements of God.Of asking vengeance. And to strike the earth with all maner of plagues. As well ghostly as bodily. S. For those holy preachers knowe that God hateth all suche as loue vngodlynesse, and that he hath manaced them sundry punish∣ments in the lawe and the Prophets: and finally that he is soothfast. And therefore they can not but with all their hartes pray God to maynteyne hys owne glory, by executing his power agaynst the despisers of his worde. And in asmuche as they pray these things according to Gods will, they can not but intreate him: according as it is written in Math. 18. c. 19. and in Iohn. 16. c. 23. and. 1. Iohn. 5. c. 14. There bee many suche prayers in the Psalmes and the Prophets, whiche séeme to desire vengeance, when as the intent of them hath respect chiefly vnto Gods glory. Neyther is it to be thought that the holy men of God in these dayes can do lesse by pray∣ing, than they could in olde tyme in that people whiche was
figuratiue: according as Iames sheweth trimly by the ex∣ample of Elias. Iames. 5. d. 17. Also yée haue examples of this power in Act. 5. a. 5. and .13. b. 10.11. and in. 2. Cor. 10. a. 4. and. 13. c. 10. A. Neuerthelesse the Apostles dyd seldome put th same in execution: whome the godly do rightly to followe in that behalfe, in as muche as they reade, that the Lorde rebu∣ked the children of Zebedie, when they would haue prayed for fyre from heauen to punishe the Samaritanes, after the example of Elias. Yée knowe not (sayth he) of what spirite you bée. The sonne of man is not come to destroy mens soules, but to saue them. Luke. 9. g. 55.56. And Paule sayth, God hathe giuen vs power to buylde vp, and not to plucke downe. 2. Cor. 13. c. 10. C. Therefore it is inough for the mini∣sters of Gods worde, if they shewe that mens doctrines and constitutions are contrarie to God, and proue that they shead away like water, and also if they cite all despisers of the word vnto Gods iudgement seate, and by the power of the holy Ghost reproue the worlde of sinne, of righteousnesse, and of iudgement.The bounds of the minister in executing▪ his authoritie or ecclesiasti∣call power. Iohn. 16. a. 8. As often as they lyst. G. This parcell is not added too stablishe an immoderate power, whereby it mighte bée lawfull for the minister of Gods worde, by his owne authoritie to excommunicate and assoyle, to bynde and loose mens consciences, to release or retayne sinnes, or too preache Iustice and mercy without hauing anye respecte of place, tyme, or person. For if a man excommunicate some poore body that is not able too giue money, althoughe he bée honest and faythfull, or assoyleth a filthy abuser of the malekinde, a murtherer, a pinchepenie, a rakehell, or suche a one as will not amende his life, as is wont to be done in the Popedome: doth not such a one abuse the keyes of the Church, that is to say, the Ecclesiasticall power? Therefore we reade that before the Lorde indued his Apostles with power to re∣lease or retayne sinnes, he sayde vnto them, Receyue yée the holy Ghost. Iohn. 20. e. 22. Teaching thereby, that the power
of bynding and loozing is in the holy Ghost, who is the best ruler of those keyes: so as no man oughte to bynde or looze without the worde of God. Otherwyse the Minister of the worde shoulde loose him vpon earth, whiche were bounde and excommunicated in heauen. Therefore whereas it is sayde héere, As often as they lyste:The certentie of the sentence that is vttered by the minister according to Gods worde, agaynst the vngodly. it dothe but shewe the cer∣tentie of Gods worde, wherethrough it happeneth to the wicked and vnbeléeuers, according to that whiche is tolde them by the worde of the Lorde: lyke as mercy and frée for∣giuenesse of sinnes are bestowed vpon the godly when they receyue the profer of it in the worde by fayth. And this cer∣teyntie or assurednesse is righte necessarie, bothe for the en∣couragement of the Ministers, whiche are sure that the word whiche they speake is ratified in heauen: and also for the strengthening of the faythfull, and the condemning of the faythlesse, vnto whome the worde of God is a moste sure warrante, as well of his mercy, as of his Iustice. So great then muste the certeyntie of Gods worde bée estéemed among all the godly, that lyke as they doubte not but God is sooth∣fast and vnchangeable: so they may assure them selues moste certeynly, that it is not possible but his worde muste be ful∣filled, and endure for euer, according as it is witnessed in Luke. 1. e. 55. f. 70.71.72.73.74.75. 7. And vvhen they shall haue fulfilled their vvitnes∣sing, the beast that came vp out of the bottomlesse pitte shall make vvarre agaynst them, and ouercome them, and put them to death. And when they shall haue fulfilled. &c. M. That is to say, when the sayd preachers of ye Gospell haue finished their race, in writing, disputing, teaching. & preaching against Antichrist, and other transgressors of the law of the Gospell: The beast that came vp out of the bottomlesse pit, that is to say Antichrist:Why Anti∣christ is called a beast. whom the holy Ghost doth therfore call a Beast, bicause he
is vtterly voyde of all spirituall vnderstanding, and of all true godlynesse and humanitie, and is altogither fearce and cruell: Moreouer also, bycause hée hathe presumptuously brought into Gods Churche, an outwarde and vnreasonable worshipping of him in superstitious, yea and in foolish Cere∣monies, contrarie to Christes institution: and finally, bicause he lyueth altogither a beastly lyfe, bothe he and all his Clear∣gie and religious sorte. For what else bee those big bellyed fa∣thers with the blowen chéekes, but franked swine? Excepte there be any among them that pyne them selues away for spite? A. Of these men the Apostle Peter writeth thus: These (sayth he) lyke brute beastes, borne by nature to bondage and destruction▪ speaking euill of the things that they knowe not, shall perishe in their owne corruption.Antichrist a hhound. 2. Peter. 2. c. 12. S. This beast (that is to wit Antichrist) is sayd to come vp out of the bottomlesse pit, bicause that beeing ingendred of the diuell, and starting euen out of the innermost dungeons of hell, he is mounted vp so high in pride, that lyke as the Gyants went about in olde tyme to driue their Iupiter out of heauen, as the fables reporte: euen so séemeth hée too bée desirous too thrust Christ the king of all kings from his kingdome, folowing the footesteppes of his father Satan, A. who hathe béene a mur∣therer from the beginning, and abode not in the truthe. Iohn 8. f. 44.Antichristes double warre against Christ and his mem∣bers. S. And the Romishe Antichrist maketh warre agaynst the preachers and folowers of the Gospell, when the masters of the Inquisition for heresie, béeing garded with a great route of Prelates, Scholemen, and Notaries, cite them ac∣cording to the prescript rules of the Inquisition, and exami∣ning them vpon Interrogatories of the Catholike fayth, doo finally giue sentēce of condemnation for heresie agaynst them when they haue persisted in the truthe. M. Therefore the Ro∣mshe Antichrist maketh warre agaynst Gods children, as wel by sophistical disputations (wherof the Apostle speaketh 1. Tim. 6. a. 3.4. & Tit. 3. c. 9.) as also by open persecution. S. For how often haue those most mercyfull & blessed fathers made
cruel and deadly war ageinst wise Princes & their Realmes, for not receiuing their gainful and pelting pardons of the Iu∣bile, or of the holy Crosse as they terme it? A. whiche thyng the Flemmings and Bohemians haue felt, as stories report.No force can stop the prea∣ching of the Gospell. By the way it is too bée marked, that the preaching of ye Gos∣pell cannot bée so stopped, but that the preachers therof must finishe their full course, thoughe the whole worlde shoulde bend his force ageinst them, according as it is easie to be ga∣thered by many places of the scripture. S. For too this purpose make those notable sayings, Go tell that foxe, beholde I cast out Diuells and heale diseases to day and to morowe, and the third day I make an end: yet notwithstanding, I must walk to day and to morowe and the next day after Luke. 13. f. 32.33. And, I must worke the workes of him that sent mée, while it is day. Iohn. 9. a. 4. And, are there not twelue houres in the day: If a man walke in the day he stumbleth not, bicause hée séeth the light of this world: but if a man walke in the nyght he stumbleth, bicause there is no light in him. Iohn. 11. b. 9.10. And Paule sayeth, vntill I finish the course of this péece of seruis. Act. 20. e. 24. And again, wherin I am punished as an offender, euen vnto imprisonment: but the word of God hath not bene imprisoned. 2. Tim. 2. b. 9. And, I am now readie too bée sacrifyced, and the time of my dissolution is at hande. I haue waged a good wager, I haue finished my race, I haue kept the faith: henseforth there is laid vp for mée the crowne of rightuousnesse. 2. Tim. 4. b. 6. Truly then do the ministers of the worde fulfill their witnessing, when the time is come that the Lord hath determined to deliuer thē into the hands of their enemyes, that (if néede bée) they may witnesse the thing with their life and bloudshed, which they haue taught in worde. Moreouer,How the sain∣ctes are ouer∣come. why the worde of the Lord is called a wit∣nessing, yée haue it in the seconde verse of the first Chapter heretofore. And ouercome thē. The Saincts are neuer ouer∣come in the sight of the Lorde, but onely in the sight of thys worlde whiche beholdeth nothing but the outwarde appée∣rances.
S. Therfore Antichrist doth then vanquish the saincts, when he bringeth them in slaunder of the world by condem∣ning them of heresie, and giueth sentence vpon them to haue them put to death as the pestilentest of all creatures by cal∣ling the ciuill Magistrate to his help. Wherin he most lewd∣ly abuseth Princes and magistrates otherwise mercifull, yea and hurtlesse of themselues, who haue in déede a zeale to God∣ward (as the Iewes had in old time) howbeit not according to knowledge, Rom. 10. a. 2. A. This kind of victorie did the ene∣mies of Iohn Baptist obtein ageinst him according as Christ saith: I say vnto you, Elias is come alreadie, and they knew him not, out haue done what they listed with him: and euen so shall the sonne of man suffer at their hands, Math. 17. b. 12.13. But this victorie is little worth. For (to speake properly) the truth cannot bée ouercome.The putting of the saincts to death. And put them to death. Some bodily, either by burning them or by beheading them, and by other kindes of death: and othersome more courteously, by condemning them to perpetuall prison: and whome he tor∣menteth not so neither,O abhomina∣ble Hypocrisie and foxish su∣perstition. at leastwise yet by thundring out the sentence of excommunication against them. S. Then shal An∣tichristes seruaunts put Christs faithfull seruaunts to death, howbeit not without disgrading them (as they terme it) and deliuering them to the secular power: least they themselues might steine their handes with bloud, and so make themsel∣ues vnworthie too kéepe the Lordes Passouer: B. that is too say, least (according to the termes of their Canōs) they might runne into Irregularitie, and therevpon bee made vnsuffici∣ent to sacrifice Christ. Which thing they shunne no lesse, thā the Iewes, when they went about too put Christ to death, did all that while refraine themselues from entering intoo any heathen mannes house, least they might haue béene defyled and so not haue eaten the Passouer.Iohn Hus, & Ierme of Prage, & Ie∣rome of Sa∣uauarola. Iohn. 18. e. 28. Hereof yée haue example in Iohn Hus, and Ierom of Prage two main∣teyners of the truthe of the Gospell, whiche were burnt at the councell of Constance: and also in Ierom Sauauarola a
frier preacher, whom Alexander Bishop of Rome the sixth of that name, commaunded too bée burned at Florence in Tus∣kane, for his stout demaunding a reformation of the Church, as he interpreted this Apocalips of Sainct Iohn to the peo∣ple. And in this wise haue many bin eyther cōdemned to per∣petuall prison, or openly put to death in sundrie tymes and places, when they were but lightly mistrusted too haue had scarce a fréendly opinion of the Bishop of Romes authoritie. Manie sillie brothers or poore men of LyonsThe poore mē of Lions. were wickedly murthered for the like cace vnder Iohn the two and twentie, or (as some wryte) vnder Boniface the eight. The lyke mat∣ter hath oftentymes bin attempted by the Bishops fauourers against the brothers of Walden in BeamelandThe brothers of Walden n in Beamland. godly and ho∣lie men liuing yet still euen vnto our dayes: which thing had taken place, if they had not bin preserued by the policie of the Kings. Furthermore who is able too number the slaughters of godly men committed in these dayes, both openly and pri∣uily, in respecte that the Romishe Antichrist feareth some a∣batement of his kingdome, by reason of the preaching of the Gospell in Germanie? And truly he thinketh not of any thing else, no nor dreameth of any thing else, than how he may stir vp all the Catholike Princes ageinst Germanie. Maruelous are the slightes that he vseth in this behalfe, labouring wyth tooth and nayle, and séeking all the wayes too the wood, howe he may betray it and put it to the swoord. By which one thing he sheweth sufficiently, that the world néedes not to be afraid of any other Antichrist than euen himselfe, considering howe he alone is séene too performe all poyntes of wickednesse, ab∣homination, and crueltie, according too the foresayings of Christ and the Prophetes, as throughly as dooth that naugh∣tipacke Mahumet. A. And yet must wée not forget the exhor∣tation of our Lorde, who willeth vs not too bée afrayde of them that slea the body, and afterwarde haue no more too doo. Math. 10. c. 28.
8. And their bodyes shall lye in the streetes of the great Citie vvhiche spiritually is called Sodom, and E∣gipt, and also vvhere our Lord vvas ctucifyed. The crueltie of Antichrist towardes the dead.And their bodyes. S. This poynt of wickednesse shall Anti∣christ vse more, that when he hathe killed them with cruell and reprochefull death, as of al men the woorst, he shall not suffer them to bée buried, but shall make them a gazingstocke and open shewe of his victorie, too the intent that others bée∣ing put in feare, may cease from preaching the truthe. And therefore he shall not suffer men too gyue them a good woord, Like as it is séene in these our dayes, which doo fully matche, or rather far surmount the crueltie of the wicked kings that slew the Lords Prophets, yea & of the Romane Emperors which haue slaine so many thousande Martyrs: so as a man cannot sée how it shoulde be increased hereafter. Of the great citie.Babylon or Rome. That is too wit, of the vngracious Babilon, wherof the first founder was that brotherqueller Caine, Gene. 4. c. 17. which was inlarged by those strong Giantes and men of re∣nounce. Gene. 6. a. 4. which was repayred agein after the flud by Nimbrod that strong hunter before the Lord. Gene. 9.10. b. 10. and which hath euer béene an enemie to Gods people. VVhich spiritually is called Sodom.Sodome or Rome. Sodom is put in the scrip∣tures as an example of all abhomination, and of Gods ven∣geance for the same. Ezec. 16. e. 46. Rome therfore may iust∣ly bée called so, bycause the shamelesnesse of hir wicked and filthie puddle of vngraciousnesse is growē so great, that now shée dareth, or rather thinkes it comely, both too doo and also too blaze abroade hir mischéeuous déedes openly, as if they were noble vertues, according as it is too bée séene by the histories of the Romane Byshops in Blondus and Platina. And Aegypt.Rome is cal∣led Egypt. So also is Rome called for hir incredible pryde and vnmeasurable desyre of bearing rule. Besides this, shée holdeth Gods people in Captiuitie, occupying them aboute clayworke and bricke, and not suffering them too yéelde true
seruice to the one God alone.Rome is like∣ned to Ieru∣salem. And also where our Lord was cru∣cifyed. G. He setteth downe Ierusalem for an example, by rea∣son of ye wickednesse, and crueltie, which was executed there by the Scribes and Pharisies the enimies of Christ. It hathe bin a murtherer of the Prophets and iust persons frō of olde, according as Christ vpbraideth hir, Math. 23. d. 37. &. Luke. 13. g. 34. And such a one for all the world, is that whorish Citie at this day, whiche vaunteth itselfe of the name of Christs Church, whereas there be in hir the most filthy Sodomits of monstrous lecherie, worthy to be burnt vp with fyre frō hea∣uen. G. There is Christ fayne to suffer and to be crucifyed day∣ly in his members, and therefore she is cursed of the Lord. 9. And they of the tribes, and peoples, and tungs, and nations shall see their bodies for three dayes and a halfe: and they shall not suffer their bodies to be put in graues. And they of the tribes. &c. A. His méening is that Antichrists persecution shall be so great, that all other nations which shal héere the brute of it, shall wonder at it, yea and abhor it. For three days and a halfe. Some taking a day for a yéere, thinke the same time to be signifyed in this place, which is betokened héeretofore by the thousand two hundred and thréescore dais: or by the two and fortie mooneths: or by the time, times, and halfe a time. And they shall not suffer their bodies. &c.Antichristes crueltie to∣wardes the dead. G. That is to wit, in token of extreme crueltie, or else to the end there should remaine no memoriall of them afterward. But thys victory is flightfull and vaine as I haue said already, bycause that by death, they open the gate for the chozen, to life and immortalitie. For although they séeme the most abiects of all men: yet is theyr death right precious in the sighte of the Lord. Psalm. 116. c. 14. And, blissed be the dead that dye in the Lorde. Héereafter. 14. c. 13. Agayne,The sainctes ouercome by beeing ouer∣come. our aduersaries get the vpper hand in multitude, pompe, authoritie, puissance, fa∣uoure, riches, and suche other lyke: but the faythfull go a∣way
with the garland for the goodnesse and excellencie of their cace, and also for the better records of the Prophetes and Apostles. A. And therefore they remaine euermore hap∣pie and blissed, whatsoeuer opinion the blind world hathe of them, or what soeuer sentence it giue against them. 10. And the inhabiters of the earth shall triumph o∣uer them, and make merry, and send presents one to a∣nother: bycause these tvvo Prophets disquieted them that dvvell vpon the earth. The reioicing of the Repro∣bates in their owne wicked∣nesse.And the inhabiters of the earth. &c. S. Like as the kings of the Iewes, and their false Prophets reioyced when they had slayne the Lords Prophets: and like as when the Pharisies had rid Christ out of the way, they beléeued that they shoulde haue had peace, and might do all things at their owne plea∣sure, and no man woulde speake againste them, by reason whereof they made maruellous ioy one to another: Euen so at this day, the gracelesse murtherers of the faithfull sorte, warrant themselues a happie and merrie world by the death of such as are cruelly slayne for the defence of the Gospell. So reioyce they in doing euill, and triumph in worst cases. Prouerb. 2. c. 14. which is a token of the greatest wickednesse that may be. They sée their owne horrible wickednesse, by reason whereof they ought of right to be striken in feare, and to be adrad of the Lords vengeance for the giltlesse blud that is shed among them: and yet they are so far off from being a∣fraid, that it doth them euen good at the hart to behold it. And send presents one to another. M. That is to say, they shall gréete one another, and thinke themselues happie, for dispatching the world of them that speake against their doctrine. Bicause these two prophets vexed.The inner∣most affectiōs and corzies of the wicked are here disclosed. &c. S. Namely by calling the people backe, both from their doctrine and trade of liuing, in asmuch as they condemne and abhorre both of them as things a∣gainst Christ. B. and also bycause they could not draw them to their opinion, neither by promises, nor by threatning, nor
yet by torments. And héere ye sée how the holy Ghost dra∣weth into the open face of the world, the very innermost af∣fections of the vngodly wherewith they be diseased: least any man might think they had no corzies to disquiet their minds withall, when they be in the middes of their welth and plea∣sures, and also in highest honor.The wicked do father all mischeeues, and miseries, and mishaps vpon the Gos∣pell. G. Neuerthelesse in the mean whyle they maliciously slaunder the doctrine of the Gospell and the pure mainteiners thereof, fathering all the mischéefe that happeneth in the world, vpon them, as who would say, that they were the authors of the seditious rebellions, and other mischéeues which happen from time to time. So the Iews said of Christ, he troubleth ye people, teaching through all Iewry. &c. And againe, we haue found this felow peruer∣ting the people, and forbidding to pay tribute vnto Caesar, saying that he is Christ the king. Luke. 23. a. 2. And king A∣chab sayd vnto Elias, Art not thou he that troublest Israell? 3. Kings. 18. c. 17. So at this day the enimies of the truthe cast foorth such spéeches as these: These Heretikes trouble al Christendome: they kéepe many still in sedition: they be too sore for the people to beare their yoke: yea and their vnto∣ward doctrine is the cause of all the harmes that happen vnto vs.To whom the Gospell is peace, and to whom not. These be the olde complaintes of Antichrist and his flatterers, whereas notwithstandig, the preachers of Gods word are ministers of peace to the faithfull: but vntoo the faithlesse and too the enimies of the truthe, they con∣stantly and vnfearefully denounce Gods vengeāce to come, as it were by the sound of a trumpet, according as the Lorde hath enioyned them Esay. 58. a. 1. 11. And after the three days and a halfe, the spirit of life entered into them from God, and they stoode vpon their feete, and there fell a great feare vpon those that savv them. And after the three days. &c. A. This place may be expoun∣ded two wais: either of the new stirring vp of ministers, or
else of the last and generall rising againe of the flesh.The martyrs that bee put to death, are re∣uiued agayne in the prea∣chers that spring vp in their roomes. S. And firste it is to be noted that oftentimes it commeth to pass through the mercifulnesse of Christe, that by the spéedie rid∣dance of tyrāts out of the world, eyther the preachers are ca∣led home agayne out of banishment, or let looce out of prison, or restored to their charge whereof they were depriued: or else that suche as had left their vocation and hid themselues out of the way for feare of persecutiō, or which had conueyed thēselues like runnagates into ye camp of Antichrist, recouer hart againe. The falling out of all which things, we do not so much reade of in stories of antiquitie, as sée by experience in our present age. And a man shal not do amisse, to expound it of those whom the Lord rayseth vp in stead of them that are de∣ceased, who become as stout champions as the other were. Like as Elias came to life againe in Iohn Baptist, Mat. 17. b 12. B. and after a sort, Christ in his Apostles. For the Pharisies were no lesse afraide after Christs passion at the preaching of his disciples. Which thing they thēselues confesse saying to ye Apostles will ye bring this mans bloud vpon vs? Act. 5. e. 28. Furthermore, looke whose memorial the aduersaries woulde haue quenched, they are receiued againe through ye blazing a∣brode of it by those that be aliue, euen mauger the Tyrants. After this manner, Iohn Hus with a few other mainteiners of the truth, being quite dispatched to the worldward, is made aliue againe to vs ward. Besides this, they whom the aduer∣saries thinke they put to death, change this life into a better, and are found not to haue liued indéede vntill now. To be short, whē they which preached ye truth stedfastly, séeme to be quite made away, the spirit of life which wrought in thē, vt∣tereth his power againe in some other, and sheweth openly that the truth is not quenched, although that they which pre∣ched it be dispatched out of ye world. But if ye like to expound this place, of the last resurrection, we must say that thys was added for the comforte of the godlye, to teache them too take hold of lyfe in the middes of death. And they stoode vpon
their feete. G. That is too say,Of standing vp vpon ones feete. they set them selues out with great stoutnesse too bée seene of their enimies. Peter which de∣nied Christ at the speaking of a wenche, stoode vp at length vpon his féete, when after Christes resurrection at such time as the Councell of Ierusalem dissuaded him from preaching of Gods worde, he answered them, wée muste rather obey God than men. Act. 5. e. 29.The bloud of martyrs is the seede of the Church. And there fell a great feare vpon those that sawe them. That is to say, when the enimies of the truthe sawe they auayled nothing by putting the Preachers of the worde to death, they were sore afrayde. Like as at this day many of the persecuters of the Gospell are constrayned to say, that they loose their labour vtterly in persecuting those that be agaynst the Popish doctrine. For the mo of them that bée burned and put too death, the mo do come away from that vntowarde doctrine to the doctrine of the Gospell: for the bloud of the Martyrs is the séede of the Churche. Yet cease not the vngodly to hate the truthe, and to persecute it wyth mighte and mayne. So sore are they blinded by Satan the prince of darknesse. A. Neuerthelesse there be some too bée founde, which beeing warned by God, returne to their righte wittes, and ceassing to shead giltlesse bloud, fall to repentance, S. in as muche as the signes and wonders that be wrought by God after the putting of the godly to death, do declare that they bée not dead, but doo lyue and reygne moste blessedly with Christ. For it is founde by experience, that great destructions by plagues haue béene often, sent by God for the contempt of his worde, and the sleaing of his Prophets, whereby he hathe both brought the vnrepentant sort to an euill ende, and also brought those backe to repentance and amendement, whiche had consented to the death of the Martyrs, eyther through ig∣norance, or for feare of death. Which thing were easie to bée shewed by the stories of the Bible, yea and euen by the very story of the passion of our Lorde.
12. And they heard a great voyce from heauen, say∣ing vnto them: Come yee vp hither. And they vvent vp into heauen in a cloude, and their enimies savve them. The glory of the Martyrs after this life.And they heard a great voyce. &c. A. In this verse Iohn she∣weth the glory that abydeth for the faythfull Martyrs of Christ after this lyfe. For although their bodies lye buryed in the earth, or bée burned into ashes: yet do their soules rest quietly and blessedly with Christ, according as we haue séene alreadie héeretofore. 6. c. 11. And they went vp into heauen in a cloude. By this worde cloude, he séemeth to giue an inkling, that the glory of the godly is not yet full and perfecte in all poyntes, before the last day of the resurrection & iudgement, at what time they shall receyue their bodies agayne, & reigne perfectly with Christ. Of which matter I haue treated héer∣tofore in the .6. verse of the sixth chapter. Except any man like better that it shoulde bee an allusion vnto the Ascention of Christ. For when he went vp into heauen, he was taken vp in a cloude, and cōueyed away from the eyes of his Disciples. Act. 1. b. 9. And their enimies sawe them. That is too say, their enimies owne consciences shall tell them that their crueltie coulde extende but onely to the bodies of the saincts, and not to the soules of them, and that their soules went vnhurte and ioyfull vnto Christ. 13. And in that houre there vvas made a great earth∣quake, and the tenth parte of the Citie fell: and in that earthquake vvere slayne the names of seuen thousande men: and the residue vvere put in feare, and gaue glo∣ry to the God of heauen. And in that houre. S. In this place the earthquake muste be taken,Hurlyburlies ensuing vpon the preaching of the Gospel. not simply, but figuratiuely, for the great hurliburly of the Princes of Antichristes kingdome among them selues, and also of mischéeues & plagues, & sundrie miseries brought
vpon them in reuengement of their euill dooings. A. For when the ministers of Gods worde apply the preaching of the Gos∣pell throughly, it can not otherwise be, but men must striue one with another about the searching out of the truthe, whyle some will haue nothing folowed but the customes of their forefathers, and other se (as reason is) will haue nothing to be folowed but the worde of God: according as Christ af∣firmeth that he bringeth the sworde and debate among men. Math. 10. d. 34. Whiche thing a man may sée in these dayes without any darknesse. For as fast as Antichrist & his army endeuour to quenche the light of the truthe: so fast do others resist him, and stoppe his tyrannie to the vttermost of their power: and so is there a very great hurlyburly among the people for the preaching of the Gospell. And the tenth parte.The fruite of the troubles that happen through the preaching of the Gospel. M. He sheweth what ensued of that earthquake, that is to say, of the hurlyburly that rose vp for the Gospels sake: namely a horrible destruction of a great multitude of men. And in that earthquake were slayne the names. &c. S. By the tenth parte of the Citie, and by the names of seuen thousande men, is ment the whole route of the vngodly. •. And he hath put the worde Names,Names. for renowmed or noble men: according to this say∣ing of Moses, These are the mightie men which haue béene men of name from the beginning. Gen. 6. a. 4. And, they haue called Landes after their owne names. Psal. 49. c. 12. Héere∣vpon wée reade partly in the stories of the Byble, but more in the histories of the Heathen, that suche stately persons haue giuen their owne names, or else the names of their children, too the Cities whiche they haue eyther buylded, or repayred, or takē by assault. After the same maner, those that were about to buyld vp the towre & citie of Babylon, sayd,Thousands of men slayne. Let vs make vs a name. Gen. 11. a. 4. A. And then are the thou∣sands slayne, when they harden more and more at the prea∣ching of Gods worde, so as there remayneth no excuse for thē to lay for them selues, according as Christ said to the Iewes, If I had not come to thē & spoken to thē. &c. Iohn. 15. d. 22. And
concerning deceyuers and false teachers, Sainct Iude sayth, S. These be cloudes without water, whiche are driuen about of the winde, Trées that wither in haruest tyme, frutelesse, twyce dead,All things turne to the benefite of the chosen. and plucked vp by the Rootes. Iude. c. 12. And the residue were put in feare. S. He speaketh of the chosen, whiche erwhile fauoured Antichrist, but in the ende were conuerted at the preaching of the Gospell. For the Lorde beareth with these, and tarieth for their amendement, wherevnto they are brought by beholding Gods dreadfull vengeance agaynst the rebels and vngodly. Thus wée sée howe God of his mercy turneth all things to good to the chozen: forbearing paciently for their sakes, that they may amende in due time, and leaue the doctrine of false guydes, and sticke to the preaching of the Gospell vnto the ende.Thankful∣nesse. And gaue glory to the God of heauen. S. q. d. They acknowledged their former miserie & blindnesse: for their deliuerie from the whiche, they magnified the name of the Lorde mightely, and yéelded them selues wholly to his obeysance and will. For so is ment in this place by giuing glory vnto God, where as in other places it is referred to swearing. Iosue. 7. c. 19. 14. The seconde vvo is past, and beholde the thirde vvo vvill come shortly. The seconde wo is past. S.G. This second wo béeing one of the thrée forespoken of by the Angell, belongeth to the trumpet of the sixth Angell, and not to any backreckening which Iohn is nowe and then wont to make in the number of sixe. For from the beginning of the tenth chapter vnto this place, he is occupied in praysing the foresayde mightie Angell that is clo∣thed with a cloude, that is to say of our Sauiour Christ, who is come of him selfe to comforte the godly agaynst the mise∣ries of the seuenth trumpet which bringeth tidings of wo. The thirde wo will come shortly.God forwar∣eh his elect. G. The Lorde of his infinite goodnesse is wont to foreshewe vnto his seruaunts the Pro∣phets, Apostles, and ministers of his worde, what shall come
vpon the world, to the intent the faythfull may by their ser∣uice and instruction, take warning betimes to looke to them selues in so troublesome state and horrible confusion, namely that neyther impacience nor feare of punishment may ouer∣come them to fall from the stéedinesse of the fayth, or to match them selues with the companie of the vngodly. For although the worlde séeme to go well with the wicked for a time: yet must they néedes be cōsumed with Gods horrible vengeance in the ende, and that much sooner than they looke for: according as the parcell shortly betokeneth, which doubtlesse was added for the comforte of the godly. Euen so, shall not God (sayth Christ) auenge his chosen which cry vnto him day and night, yea though he deferre them? I tell you he will auenge them, & that quickly. Luke. 18. b. 7.8. Also looke afore. 1. a. 1. &. 6. c. 11. 15. And the seuenth Angell blevv his trumpet, and there vvere made great voyces in heauen, saying: The kingdomes of this vvorlde are become our Lordes and his Christes, and he shall reigne for euermore. Amen. And the seuenth Angell blew. &c. This last trumpet is the messenger of the resurrection, finall iudgement and full ende,The generall or last resur∣rection. & the full accōplish∣ment of Chri∣stes kingdom. and consequently of the renuing of the worlde, according to the Apostle which sayth, A. wée shall be changed euen in a mo∣ment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the sounde of the laste trumpe. For the trumpe shall blowe, and the dead shall ryse incorruptible, and wée shal bée chaunged. 1. Corinth. 15. g. 51.52. And in another place he sayth, And the Lorde him selfe shall come downe from heauen with a shoute, and the voyce of the Archangell and the trumpe of God. 1. Thes. 4. d. 16. and Da∣niel. 12. a. 2. And there were made great voyces. &c. M. That is too say, there were great prayses giuen vnto God, for the sal∣uation of the chosen, and for the endlesse damnation of Anti∣christ and his adherentes. Saying, the kingdome. &c. S. That is too say, nowe at length the Lorde and his Christ hauing cast out Satan the Prince of the worlde, reigneth perfectly
and fully in vs. M. For then will it appéere cléerly, that Christ both God and man in one person, is King of all things both in heauen, in earth and vnder the earthe, notwythstandyng that hys doctrine seemed vyle among the fleshely sort and the castawayes. S For althoughe that euen from the first publi∣shing of the Gospell in the world, this hath béen true, namely I haue made him King vpon Sion the hill of my holinesse. Psal. 2. b. 6. and also this, Thou hast put all things vnder his féete, Psalm. 8. b. 6. and also this, Sit thou on my right hande till I make thine enemyes thy footestoole, Psalm. 110. a. 1. B. (which thing Christ himselfe also hath shewed, saying, If I bee lifted vp from the earth I shall draw all things vnto mée, Iohn. 12. d. 32. And also the Apostle saying, Therefore hathe God exalted him on hyghe, and gyuen him a name aboue all names, that in the name of Iesus euery knée shoulde bow, both of things in Heauen, and things in earthe, and things vnder the earth, Phil. 2. b. 9.10.) A. Yet do wee not sée al things put vnder him as yet, Heb. 2. b 8. But when he shall haue de∣liuered vp his kingdome too God the Father, when he shall haue abolished all principalitie, & power, and strength, when he shall haue dispatched the last enemie which is death, then shall wée with full mouthe sing the ioyfull song of victorie, B. saying. The kingdome of this worlde is become our Lorde Iesus Christes.The euerla∣sting reigne of Christ in and with his cho∣sen: and the endlesse tor∣mente of the wicked. &c. And he shall raigne. Namely in his chosen and with his chosen, after he hath set his kingdome at a stay. A. For their enemyes shall not bée able too breake the peace of truth any more, bycause they shall bée alreadie layde vnder Christes foote too bée his footestole. That is too say, they shall bée thrust downe intoo hell fyre. There shall bée the worme that neuer dyeth, and the fyre whiche is not quenched. Esai. 66 g 24. and Mark. 9. g. 44. But the rightuous shall shyne as the Sunne in the Kingdome of their father. Math. 13. f. 43. Which thing was trimly shadowed in the reigne of Dauid, who after his anoynting, when he had béene tossed wyth in∣numerable troubles, at length after manye assaultes of hys
enemies, yea and after manie glorious victories, obteyned a quiet reigne in the ende. A. And Peter sayth likewise, wherin yée reioyce, though nowe for a season (if néede require) yee are in heauinesse through manifold temptations, that the tryall of your fayth béeyng much more precious than golde that pe∣risheth though it bée tryed wyth fyre, myght bée found to your prayse glorie and honour at such tyme as Chryste shall ap∣péere. 1, Peter. 1. a. 6.7. And whereas héere is added, for euer∣more: M. therby is confuted the heresie of such as imagine that men shall after a certeine tim returne intoo their accusto∣med life ageine. The worde Amen betokeneth the certeintie of these things, which must bée a singular comforte vntoo all the godly, so as they hauing theyr eyes alwayes fyxed vpon that daye of redemption, maye patiently beare whatsoeuer troubles are laid vpō them in this world. For the afflictions of this presente tyme are not comparable too the glorie that shall be shewed vpon vs. Rom. 8. d. 18. 16. And the .xxiiij. Elders vvhich sit in the presence of God vpon their seates, fell dovvne vpon their faces and vvorshipped God, 17. Saying: VVee yelde thee thankes O Lord God almightie, vvhich arte, and vvhich vvart, and vvhiche art too come: for thou hast receiued thy great povver, and hast reigned. And the foure and twentie. A. Wée haue spoken of these foure and twentie Elders heretofore, 4. b. 4.Lyke as the Saincts prai∣sed God vpon earth, so doe they also in Heuen. M. Not onely the lesser & yonger sort but also the greater & elder sort of saintes shall glorifie God at yt tyme. Fell downe vpon their faces. To giue thankes vnto God for hys graces & benefites bestowed vpon thē. And worshipped God. A. Like as in this life they had serued god & not antichrist: euē so being receiued vp into glory
they magnifie the same God with continuall prayses. Saying, wee yeelde thee thanks.Thankful∣nesse. Truely great and incessant thanksgi∣uing is due vnto God for his great, innumerable, yea and e∣uerlasting benefites. And certesse there can no benefite be sayde to be greater than this, that the very sonne of God in∣countering with our most cruell enimie in the frayltie of our fleshe (by whom he was after a sorte vanquished for a whyle during the time of his death) did afterward get the vpper-hand by vttering his owne power agayne: and hauing vtterly van∣quished the aduersarie powers, (that is to wit the diuell, the world, sinne, death, & hell) receyued the kingdome to reigne ouer those that be his, according as Dauid foresingeth in cer∣tayne Psalmes: Gird thy sword vpon thy thigh, O thou most mightie. &c. Psal. 45. a. 3. Also, The Lord reigneth, let the earth reioyce. Ps. 96. c. 10. Also, the Lord reigneth: he is clothed with beautie. &c. Ps. 93. a. 1. O Lord God almightie. A. We haue spokē of this title of God héeretofore. 1. b. 8. VVhich art, & which wrt, & which art to come. S. It is a song (wherin amōg other things) the contrarie workings of the aduersarie powers are laughed to scorne, who practised all that they could, that Christ might not reigne, or rather that he might not haue béene at all, no nor so much as the very name of him might haue remayned: and yet nowe he reigneth and shall reigne whether the wic∣ked will,God onely is, and all other things be in him, and by him, or no. And the three differences of tymes do by a circumstance betoken Gods euerlastingnesse which is begin∣ninglesse and endlesse. Wherefore, too bee, is peculiar onely vnto God alone. Whiche thyng the Hebrewes saye is betokened by that vnutterable name of God yehouah, whiche is spoken of in Exodus. 3. d. 14. B. And all creatures haue so muche Beeing, as they partake of the nature of the Godhead. A. According too this saying of Paules: by him wée lyue, and are moued, and bée. Act. 17. f. 28. For his meaning is that wée bée (after a sorte) conteyned in God, who dwel∣leth in vs by his power. And the cause why he hath separa∣ted him selfe from all his creatures by his sayde peculiar
name of yehouah, is that wée might knowe, how that (in pro∣per spéech) he only is of him selfe, and that we haue our béeing in him, in asmuch as he quickneth and vpholdeth vs with hys spirite: for the power of his spirite is shed abroad through all parts of the world, to maynteyne them in their state, and too giue that freshnesse to heauen & earth which we sée in them, & also to giue mouing to all liuing things. And forasmuch as the life of man is more excellent than mouing, and mouing is more excellent thā only béeing: Paule hath placed that thing foremost which is chiefest, to the intent to come down to bée∣ing, by degrées in this wise: we not only haue not any life, sauing in God, but also wée haue not any mouing, no nor any béeing (which is inferiour vnto both the other) but in him. Wée say that the life beareth preheminence in men, bicause they not only haue cōmon sence and mouing as well as brute beasts haue: but also are endued with reason & vnderstāding. Worthily therfore dothe the Scripture aduaunce this singu∣lar gifte wherwithall God hath endued vs, with peculiar ti∣tles of commendation by it selfe. And héereby wée sée, that all such as know not God, knowe not them selues, inasmuche as they haue God present, not onely in the singular qualities of the minde, but also in the very Beeing of it: for too bee, is in∣cident to none but vnto God, and all other things haue their Beeing in him. For thou haste receyued thy great power.Christes reig¦ning. It is the cause why the godly reioyce and prayse God. Namely for that he hath once vttered his power in subduing the aduersary powers for altogither, and in making a full ende of all iniqui∣ties: during the reigning wherof in the world, Gods power was not séene, neyther séemed he to reigne, but the vngodly. Wherefore in the meane whyle, the faythfull pray conti∣nually, Thy kingdome come. Math. 6. b. 10. And what else is that, than to pray for the vtter destruction of the vngodly, which haue a spite at Christes kingdome, and robbe him of his glory. M. To bée short, Christ receyueth, vttereth, and sheweth his great power, when he vanquisheth & condemneth all the
enimies of his doctrine, and preserueth his owne seruantes. And hast reigned. It would be more fitly translated. Thou hast gotten the kingdome or soueraintie. For he is sayde to haue reigned whose reigne is come to an ende. But in these words it is ment otherwise: namely that he reigneth and shal reigne euerlastingly without ende of tyme. 18. And the Heathen vvere vvroth, and thy vvroth is come, and the time of the dead, that they shoulde bee iudged, and that thou shouldest render hyre vnto thy seruants the Prophets and Saincts, and vnto them that feare thy name, both small and great, and shouldest de∣stroy them that destroy the earth. Who be hea∣then.And the Heathen were wroth. A. By the name of Heathen he meaneth all suche as béeing voyde of the true knowledge of God and of the holy Ghost, haue made warre agaynst the Gospell, S. whether they bée Iewes or Christians, or Tur∣kes, or by what name soeuer they bée called according to the outwarde conuersation of lyfe. For it is certayne that the Heathen were angrie, and (not without vprore) conspired with the Iewes agaynst the Lorde, and agaynst his anoyn∣ted, that he might not haue reigned any where in the whole worlde. Psal. 2. a. 1. and Acts. 4. c. 25. And thy wrath is come. No maruell though the wrath of God come whiche the vn∣godly haue béene tolde of so often aforehande.Gods wrathe agaynst the reprobates. For séeing that they haue begonne firste too bée angry with God withoute cause: worthily haue they hoorded vp his wrath & indigna∣tion agaynst them selues: according to this saying. Then will he speake too them in his wrath, and vexe them in his sore displeasure. Psal. 2. b. 5. Therfore, that whiche the .xxiiij. Elders speake héere, is all one as if they shoulde say. In déede the Heathen haue wreaked their anger and malice vp∣on vs by thy sufferance: howbeit that was but for a whyle, bicause our sinnes had required it: And nowe is the long wi∣shed
houre come, that thy wrath, which is moste mightie, and which no man is able too withstande, must take his turne al∣so, and burne vpon the Heathen to continue for euer. A. Of this wrath Iohn Baptist preached thus, yee Adders broode, who gaue you warning too slée from the wrath too come? Math. 3. b. 7. And Christ sayth, He that beléeueth the sonne hath lyfe euerlasting: but he that beléeueth not the sonne, shall not sée life, but the wrath of God abideth vpon him. Iohn. 3. d. 36. And Paule sayth, yée be turned from Images vnto God, to serue the liuing and true God, and to wayte for hys sonne from heauen, whome he hathe raysed from death, euen Iesus whiche deliuereth vs from the wrath too come. 1. Thes. 1. d. 9.10. Happie are they that escape this wrath by the gyfte of fayth: and contrariwise, vnhappie are they that shall feele it. For it is a sore thing too fall into the handes of the liuing God. Hebr. 10. f. 31. And the tyme of the dead.Who be the dead. S. Namely of them that were wroth and kept a sturre that thou shouldest not reigne ouer them: and repented not when they were warned of it: whome neuerthelesse thou (according to thy long sufferance and pacientnesse) dyddest forbeare, vntill the appoynted tyme of their punishment shoulde come. There∣fore by the name of the dead, héere maye bée vnderstoode all the vngodly, lyke as héereafter. 20. b. 5. For the godly lyue for euermore, A. according too this texte, Euery one that ly∣ueth and beléeueth in mée shall neuer dye. Iohn. 11. c. 26. That they should be iudged. M. That is to say,Damnation. that they shoulde be damned. This is ment of the Reprobates. For the chozen are out of the danger of damnation, according as Christ him∣selfe witnesseth in these wordes, Verily verily I say vnto you, he that heareth my worde, and beleeueth in him that sent mée, hathe euerlasting lyfe: and shall not come into iudge∣mente, but shall passe out of death into lyfe. Iohn. 5. d. 24. And agayne, verily verily I saye vnto you, if a man kéepe my sayings, he shall neuer sée death. Iohn. 8. f. 51. Also Paule sayth: Then is there no damnation for them that
bée grafted in Iesu Christ, which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirite.Generall iudgemēt and resurrection of the dead. Rom. 8. a. 1. S. Neuerthelesse this place may bée taken generally of all the dead, in this sense: The tyme is come that the generall iudgement shall bée gyuen vpon all the dead: A. According to this saying of our Sauiour: the houre shall come that all they which are in their graues shall heare his voyce. Iohn. 5. e. 28. Whereby wée gather that all the dead shall ryse euery one of them agayne in their fleshe: according as it is sayde in another place, this is he whome God hath ordeyned iudge of the quicke and the dead. Act. 10. g. 42. Also, wée must all of vs shew our selues at the iudgement seate of Christ, that euery man may receyue the things they haue done with their bodies, according to their déedes, be it good or be it euill. 2. Cor. 5. b. 10. Wherevnto also perteyneth that which Christ sayth, And all Nations shall be gathered togi∣ther before him. Math. 25. c. 32. Howbéeit that the endes of the good and of the bad shall bée farre dyuers, lyke as is added im∣mediatly. And that thou shouldest render hyre vnto thy seruants. S. The Lorde shall bring to lighte the things that were coue∣red,Wherfore eter¦nal life is cal∣led by ye name of hyre. and make the righteousnesse of the godly to shine as the noone day, whome the gracelesse world had condemned for the worst of all men. Psal. 32. a. 6. and Esai. 58. e. 8 and .1. Cor. 4. a. 5. And it is called by the name of hyre in the Scripture, not absolutely, nor yet for the workes sakes, but in respect of the bountifulnesse of the promiser: as for example, If a man buy a bondslaue, he is wholly at his masters cōmaundement, and what soeuer seruice or toyle he doth, it is wholly his lorde and Masters. Now if the master should of his owne frée goodnesse promise his slaue any wages for shewing him selfe diligent & faithful in doing him seruice, surely it were rather a rewarde thā a hyre: but yet ye masters promising of it, giueth it ye name of hyre. By reason wherof our sauiour Christ saith: whē you haue done all that is commaunded you, say yée, we be vnprofi∣table seruants.Who be Pro∣phets. Luke. 17. c. 10. The Prophets. Among Gods ser∣uants, he reckneth Prophets in the first place, that is to say,
the guides of his worde, by whō others learne right wisdome. For God doth therfore reueale his word to his Prophets, that they should shew the same vnto others. And by the name of Prophets, are ment any that teach others aright concerning God & the true worshipping of him, & concerning righteous∣nesse & innocencie: looke further in the .3. verse of this present chap. Such are they which laying aside al feare of mā arme thēselues with the sword of Gods word, & fight constantly and stoutly against the proud kingdome of Antichrist, indeuoring to plucke the godly out of the mouths of the wolues, and by all meanes to gather thē togither into Christes flock. And Saincts.Saincts. He calleth those Saincts which are made holy by the spirite of Christ, & which cōtinue stedfastly in ye profession of his name. And vnto thē that feare thy name.Who be they that feare God. A. It is a trim circumstance of betokening the faithful, very rifely vsed in the Prophets & the Psalmes. For inasmuch as ye feare of the Lord is ye beginning & whole substance of wisdome, no man can be sayd to worship or serue God aright, but he that feareth him. By reason wher∣of the feare of God is taken oftentimes in holy writ for the whole seruice or worshipping of God: like as when it is said, the feare of the Lord cōtinueth cleane for euer. Psal. 19. c. 10. Both to great and smal.Who be the smal, and wh be the grea. S. Again he deuideth ye whole nūber of the beléeuers into two parts. The smal are the simple, vnlerned, bondfolk, seruants, poore, afflicted, silie women, & weake chil∣dren, which acknowledge God the father, & beléeue thēselues to be redéemed frō the power of the diuell by the death of his sonne Iesus Christ. All these (say I) shal receiue the promised hyre. And the great are those that are both honored and had in estimation of the world for the nobilitie of their birth, for their power, wealth, learning, & holinesse, & which serue God earnestly, & inforce others to do the same. Suche as we reade that Abraham, Dauid, Iosias, Ezechias, & the prophets Esay, Daniel, & also Nicodemus, & suche like, were.A briefe com¦prehending of all the wic∣ked. And that thou shouldest destroy them that destroy the earth. M. That is to say, that thou shouldest destroy Antichrist the sonne of perditiō, and
all his armie. S. He hath moste briefly and trimly vttered a thing of exceeding great largenesse. Men wonder at theVirgill. Poet for wrapping vp the whole state of Troy as it were in one worde, where he sayth, And eke the fieldes where Troy earst stoode. But our Iohn hath in this place wrapped vp, not some Troy, but the whole worlde, in a maner in one worde, say∣ing: That thou shouldest destroy them that destroy the earth. For what store of words had a man néede to haue, if he would declare to the full, howe wholly the wicked are occupied in wasting all things, in mischéeuing all things, and in de∣stroying all things? Whatsoeuer they dreame, whatsoeuer they thinke, and finally, whatsoeuer they speake or doo, all their endeuer, and all their practises tende to none other ende, but howe to oppresse and destroy most men. Agayne, what a worlde of wordes woulde it require, to vtter the destruction wherewith God will at length destroy all the wicked, accor∣ding to the exigent thereof?God execu∣teth mercy before ven∣geance. And it is to bée marked, that Iohn hathe first spoken of the large rewarde and euerlasting blisse of the godly, before he would speake of the punishment of the Reprobates: too the intent wée may knowe, that God dothe first and formoste execute the things that make to grace and mercy, and afterward procéede to the punishing and auenging of the euill. So sayth Christ in another place, They that haue done good shall go into the resurrection of lyfe: and they that haue done euill into the resurrection of iudgement. Iohn. 5. e. 29. And the chosen are first called to the heauenly kingdome, ere the Reprobates bée thrust by the Iudge into hell fyre. Math. 25. c. 34. And when our Lorde sent his Apostles into the whole world, he made mention of releasing sinnes before he spake of deteyning them, saying: whose sinnes soeuer yée release, they he released vnto them: and whose sinnes soeuer yée retayne, they bée retayned. Iohn. 20. e. 23. Wherevnto also belongeth that which the Apostle sayth: wée haue ven∣geance readie at hande agaynst all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled. 2. Corin. 10. b. 6. Lastly yée must marke
the difference betwéene the chosen and the Reprobates.The differēce betweene the chosen and the reprobates. For the chosen, béeing replenished with the holy Ghost, edifie as wel them selues as others by purenesse of doctrine and exam∣ple of life. But the Reprobates worke excéeding harme, not onely to them selues, but also vnto many others, according as Paule sayth, But the euill men and deteyners shall ware worse and worse, while they deceyue and are deceyued them selues. 2. Tim. 3. d. 13. 19. And the temple of God vvas opened in heauen, and the Arke of his Testament was seene in his temple, and there folovved lightnings, and voyces, and thun∣derings, and earthquakes, and great hayle. And the temple of God. &c. M.G. There be some which begin the twelfth chapter at this verse: which thing they séeme not to do without reason. S. For heretofore in the third verse of the eyght chapter; Iohn had brought in an Angell standing before the altar with a golden Censer in his hande. &c. and then cut∣ting off his talke of that Angell, he went foorth with his talke concerning the seuen Angels blowing their Trumpets. And now he returneth to his talke which he had begon concerning the sayd Angell that stoode before the Altar, intending to de∣clare the great battayle of the sayd Angell (whom he nameth Michaell) agaynst a most cruell dragon. Which thing the or∣der of his declaration sheweth, in that he sayth, And the Tem∣ple was opened. &c.When & how ye temple was oene. Whereby he calleth vs backe to the things that went before, where he sayde, And there came another Angell and stoode before the altar, hauing a golden Censer. &c. Heretofore. 8. a. 3. And truely, then was the temple of God opened in heauen, when at the preaching of the Apostles too the whole world, it was beléeued that Iesus Christ, who was put to death vpon the crosse, is aduaunced to the right hande of the father, and is equall in estate with him, whereof Paule writeth to the Philip. 2. b. 9. And furthermore when it was beléeued that he standeth in the presence of God for vs,
as it is written. Heb. 9. f. 24. A. And finally, when the vayle of the temple was rent a sunder, and the things began to be dis∣closed and shewed openly abroade, which lay hid before. And the arke of his testament was seene.Christ ye arke of the Testa∣ment. M. That is to say, Christ is now discouered in the doctrine of his Gospel, and in al the new Testament, in whom all the treasures of wisedome & know∣ledge are bestowed. Colos. 2. a. 3. Who hath fulfilled the olde Testament and filled the newe. S.G. For Christ béeing man, is the true arke of the couenant, bicause the whole fulnesse of the Godhead (lying inclosed in him as in an Arke or Chist) dwel∣leth in him bodily. Colos. 2. b. 9. At the beholding of whome, God is become at one with vs. For God the father hath set him foorth to bée the attonement maker through fayth by the meanes of his bloud. Rom. 3. d. 25. A. In respect whereof he is also called the attonement for our sinnes.Where Christ is to be sought 1. Iohn. 2. a. 2. In hys Temple. Christ is not to be sought elsewhere than in the tem∣ple of God, that is to say, in his Churche. In vayne therefore doo they pretende his name, whiche boast them selues to bée Gods seruants & Christians, and yet holde scorne of the doc∣trine of the Gospell, which is to be founde no where but in the Churche of Christ.Troubles and turmoyles fo∣low the Gos∣pell. And there followed lightnings, and voyces, and Thunderings. M. It hath béene often sayde alreadie, that the doctrine of the Gospell can not be preached openly, but that wonderfull alterations will bée séene, bicause some bée mynded to serue Christ, and some to obey Antichrist. The Pope curseth all those that imbrace the doctrine of the Gospel earnestly, and indeuer to obey only Christ. On the other side the preachers of Gods worde crie out with inuincible courage of minde as Paule dyd, If any man loue not the Lord Iesus Christ, the same bée Anathema & Maranatha. 1. Cor. 16. d. 22. Also, If wée our selues or an Angell from heauen shal preache vnto you any other Gospel than wée haue preached vnto you, let him be accursed. Gal. 1. b. 8. Also, if any man come vnto you and bring not this doctrine, receyue him not to house, neyther bid him God spéede. For he that byddeth him God spéede, is
partaker of his euill déedes. 2. Iohn. d. 10.11. Héerevpon come those lightenings, those voyces, those thunderings, and those earthquakes, agaynst the which it behoueth the faythful to b armed with the sworde of Gods worde, and the Target of fayth. And great hayle. M. By the name of Hayle, are ment per∣secutions.Persecutions For like as hayle is very noysome to the fruites of the earth, specially when they begin but to bud: euen so doth persecution strike many weake and féeble folke in feare, and make them to renounce the doctrine of the Gospell: and so they beléeue for a time, and slip away in time of tryall. Luke. 8. b. 13. But they that bee the stronger sorte become more no∣table by persecutions: so farre are they off from shrinking from the Gospell. The twelfth Chapter. AND there appeared a great vvonder in heauen, a vvoman clothed vvith the Sunne, and the Moone vnder hir feete, and vpon hir head a Crovvne of tvvelue Starres. AND there appeared a great wonder in heauen.The contents of these chap∣ters. A. In this Chapter there is a discourse made of the incounter that Christes Churche vnderta∣keth agaynst Satan & the wicked, & of the vic∣torie that is bestowed vpō the Church, though Satan worke all the while in his owne stubbornharted chil∣dren. M. And to the intent this chapter may be the easiyer ex∣pounded, it is necessarie to consider, that the Churche is taken thrée wayes among the Doctors. One way is,The diuers taking of the word church. in that it is di∣stinguished from a Sinagoge: and so is all the whole sorte of Christians that professe the fayth, called the Church, whether they be true Christians or falsechristians. Another way is, when it is taken for any maner of congregation of the fayth∣full, whether they be faythfull both in profession of fayth, and
in works, or whither they be faithfull but in name only, that is to wit in the only professiō of the faith.The catholik Churche. And the third way is, when it is taken for the whole number of the predesti∣nate: and this only is the true and Catholike Church, wher∣of there is not any part foreknowen to damnatiō. A. Against this Church the Diuell maketh warre continually, and prac∣tiseth to plucke hir backe from the faith that she hath pligh∣ted to hir husband Christ: as we shall sée anone. S. The signe which he calleth great in this place, is vndoubtedly that signe which the mightie men of the world, yea and all the whole world itselfe speaketh against Luk. 2. e. 34. Namely the com∣ming vp of Christs kingdome. M.G. And sure it is a great and wonderfull thing, that any are founde among the faithfull, which dare set themselues against the kingdome or rather the Tyrannie of Antichrist.The true churche lyke∣ned to a wyfe whose husbād and heade is Chryste. A woman. That is to saye, the Church of the beléeuers. S. For the Apostolike and primitiue Church is rightly compared to a woman, who though she be of hir owne nature frayle, small, and barrein, yet is she made frutefull with many childrē, & great by hir husbande Christ. Esa. 54. a. 1. & Gal. 4. d. 27. Which thing was prefigured afore in Sara ye wif of the Patriark Abraham. In respect wherof Christ comforteth his Church with these wordes. Be not a∣fraid my little flocke, for it hath pleased your father to gyue you a kingdome. Luke. 12. d. 32. G. Moreouer like as the man is the head of ye womā: so is Christ ye head of the Church. 1. Cor. 11. a. 3. & Eph. 1. d. 22. &. 4. c. 15. Clothed with the Sunne. •. That is to say,The purenes and brightnes of the true Churche. glistering euery way about with the light of the euer∣lasting Gospel, that is to wit in doctrine and conuersation of maners: according to this text, you are the light of the world. Mat. 5. b. 14. A. Also be ye such as no man may complaine of you, & vndefyled children of God, vnblamable in the mids of this wicked & crooked generatiō: amōg whom shine you like Lampes in ye world, mainteining the word of life. Phi. 2. b. 15 Also, as many of you as are baptized, haue put on Christe. Gal. 3. d. 27. M. Certes the Church that hath put on Christ in
hir conuersation and doctrine, is much more cléerely enlight∣ned by the spirit, than ye aire is by the Sunne.The true Church ouer∣ruleth al tem∣porall things. And the Moone vnder hir feete. Hereby is signifyed the disposing of temporall goodes according to Gods appointmēt, which goodes ye saincts do rule and not serue. For the Moone being chaungeable doth trimly set out the state and condition of the things and affay∣res of this world. For what shall a man find stedye and con∣stant in this world? For as the (Apostle saith) the fashion of this world passeth away. 1. Cor. 7. f. 31. A. Wherefore they that haue consecrated themselues vnto Christ, do easly despise all worldly things: nay rather, (if néede so require) they trample thē vnder their féete, yt they may do their seruice vnto Christ alone. The true marke of Christes seruants is this: namely if they haue an eye only vnto Christs glory, despysing all o∣ther things & as it were keeping them vnder foote: according to this exhortatiō of Iohns, Loue not ye world nor the thinges that be in it &c. 1. Iohn. 2. b. 15. And apply not yourselues (saith Paule) to the fashion of this world. Ro. 12. a. 2.The orna∣ments of the true Church. And on hir head was a crowne of twelue starres. The twelue Apostles do won∣derfully garnish the head (that is to say the beginning of the primitiue Church) like bright Starres. Notwithstāding for asmuch as the number of twelue is the number of perfection and vniuersalitie: by them we like well to vnderstād al mē, as many as teach Christ purely. Whome also Daniel ye pro∣phet likeneth vnto ye Stars of the Skie, Dan. 12. a. 3. Which thing appéereth to be almost an ordinarie matter with Iohn in this booke. And although those twelue Apostles whom the primitiue Churche had are not now conuersant among vs: yet notwithstanding for asmuch as their doctrine is conueyd ouer vnto vs as it were from hand to hand, Christes Church wanteth not this beautifull ornament which Iohn attribu∣teth vnto hir. For ye things which the scripture speaketh of ye Apostles, must not be restreined to ye persons of them: but are extended to all suche as are the true successors of the Apo∣stles: that is to say, vnto all suche as preache to other men.
Christ alone, and the same crucified. •. But some mis the things vnto the Virgin Mary,The Virgin Mary. that are spoken héere of e Churche, according as the texte moste manifestly prth▪ But what maruell is it if some mens foolishe rashenesse dare do this, séeing that the vnskilfull hue presumed to t ouer to the same Virgin the things that agrée to none bt Christ, contrarie to the Interpretation of all the olde wry∣ters. 2. And beeing vvith childe she cried out in trauell, and strayned hir selfe to be deliuered. The greefe of the Churche for want of wished suc∣cesse in win∣ning soules vnto God.And beeing with childe. Namely béeing great with chie by the séede of Gods worde, shée hopeth to bring foorth may children by it vnto God. And strayned hir felfe to be deliuered. He betokeneth the griefe and longing of minde of the primi∣tiue Churche, béeing alreadie great with childe by the spirite of Christ, and drawing to deliuerance. And she was strayned with sorenesse and payne, for that the Priests, Pharisies, and Scribes of the Iewes, and the Princes and wise men of the world kept a stirre by all meanes agaynst the preaching of the Apostles, so as the matter could not take successe as they would haue it, according as Luke witnesseth in Acts. 3. c. 15. and .4. d. 18. and .5. e. 28. and .13. g. 46. And as Eusebius also wit∣nesseth in the stories of the Churche. So also the godly tea∣chers and ministers of the Churche in our dayes must néedes be sore vexed at the hart, for the multitude of those that speake agaynst them, when they labour to beget men vnto Christ. For looke what Christ hath foresaid to his Disciples, the same must be extended vnto all ministers of Gods worde. If they haue persecuted me (sayth he) they will also persecute you and if they haue kept my sayings, they will kéepe yours also. Iohn. 15. c. 20. And agayne, when a woman laboreth of ch, she hath sorowe.What it is to be with child. &c. Iohn. 16. c. 21. Whervpon Paule wrate to the Galathians, My little babes, of whō I trauell with childe agayne, till Christ be fashioned in you, Galath. 4. e. 19. And
truly all the faithfull must be with child of Christ by faithe: that is to say they must imbrace Gods word by fayth, and at length bring foorth the same: that is to say they must bring foorth the good frutes of faith which is workfull by charitie, which thing cannot be done without some paine. For all that will liue well in Christe Iesu must suffer persecution. 2. Timo. 3. c. 12. 3. And there vvas seene another wonder in heauen: and behold a great red dragon, hauing seuen heads and tenne hornes, and seuen Crovvnes vpon his heads. And there was seene another. &c. G.M. Héere is shewed a far diuers woonder from that which went afore. For vnder the figure of the great red dragon that troubleth the Churche in hir traueling with child, héere is described the crueltie and violence of Satans kingdome.The crueltie and violence of Satans king¦dome. And behold a great red dragon.Why Satan is sayde to bee great. S. He is great in respect both of his greate power, and also of his great lust to do mischéefe. He is great also in respect of the innumerable number of the vngodly, whiche are as it were the body of the dragon. A. For Satan is the head and prince of all the vngodly, bycause he driueth them at his owne plea∣sure. 2. Tim. 2. d. 26. & Eph. 2. a. 2. Red.Why he i sayde to bee red. S. That is to say al blud∣dy with the blud of innocents, whom he hath slayne from the beginning of the world: for he is a murtherer from the begin∣ning. Iohn. 8. f. 44. Whiche thing appéereth by that first bro∣ther queller Cain, who was of this cursed broode. 1. Iohn. 3. b. 12. Satan is iustly likened to a dragon or Serpent, not onely in this place, but also in Gen. 3. a. 1. & Psal. 58. a. 4. &. 74. c. 14. & 91. c. 13. &. 2. Cor. 11. a. 3. For he is both excéeding wyly, and also mischeuous. A. Therefore not without cause dothe Peter ex∣hort the faithfull to be sober & to watch: wherof he addeth the reason immediatly, saying: bycause your aduersarie the diuel goeth about like a roring Lyon,The power of Satans schis∣maticall king∣dome. séeking whome he may de∣uoure. Whome resist ye strong in faith. 1. Peter. 5. b. 8.9. Ha∣uing seuen heads and ten hornes. S. The head and the horne be∣token
the power of his kingdome. Seing then that the dragō hath seuen heads and ten hornes: it séemeth to signifye aptly a Schismaticall kingdome. For the kingdomes of the world are one anothers bane. Now for asmuch as seuen and ten be numbers of vniuersalitie: it is ment that the dragon hathe power ouer all kingdomes of the world, and is prince of the whole worlde, according as he himselfe boasteth of it vntoo Christ. Math. 4. b. 9. This then is the strong felow which kée∣peth his fort as long as he can, til a stronger come vpon him and thrust him out. Luke. 11. c. 21. And looke where diuision is, there is like to be destruction. A. Truly héere is set out vntoo vs an horrible monster, a great red dragon with seuen heads and ten hornes.What is ment by hys seuen heades. By the first head he beguiled Eue, and ther∣by subdued all mankind to his lure. By the seconde, he won∣derfully increased Idolatrie. 3. Kings. 12. f. 26. &. 13. a. 1. By the third is meant the kingdome of the Chaldies and Assyrians, by whome both the holy stories and also the prophets report many warres to haue bin made against Gods people, and also that they hild them in long captiuitie: The fourth head betokeneth the kingdome of the Medes and Persians, by whome the Iewes were indéede released of their captiuitie, but yet they suffered sundry miseries at their handes, as ye may reade in the bookes of Nehemias, Esdras, and Hester. The fifth betokeneth the kingdome of the Gréekes or Mace∣dons, by whom at the beginning the Iewes were delt with∣all somewhat mildly: but toward the end of it, when the An∣tiochusses reigned, they were handled most cruelly. The sixth betokeneth the kingdome of the Romanes, vnder whom they suffered many things at the handes of the Herods and of the presidents or gouernors of the realme of Iewry, as ye may sée in the story of the Gospel, and in the Acts of the Apostles, and finally in Iosephus. Besides this, euen Christe himselfe & his Apostles with many thousand martyrs suffered death vnder the Romane Iudges. By the seuenth and last head is betokened the kingdome of Antichrist, which is the sorest e∣nimie
of all against Christs Church,What is be∣tokned by his ten hornes. according as experience sheweth. By his ten hornes, are betokened excéeding greate strength, and all kind of mischéefe, and all policie to anoy. For Satan the auncient enimie of truth, indeuereth to hurt the Church, sometime by crueltie and open force, sometime by hipocrisie, and sometime by heresie. And on his heads,Satans vic∣torie agaynst the Saincts, and ye Popes making of himselfe equ with Chr st. seuen Crownes. These seuen Crownes of the dragon, betoken hys many victories gotten of most puissant princes: wherevnto the Bishop of Rome alludeth with his triple crowne vnder a mysterie. Neuerthelesse by that figure he will haue it séene that he is Christs péere in souereintie of things in heauen, things in earth, and things vnder the earth: that is to saye, that he is able to commaund euen the Angels of heauen, and the chéefest princes vpon earth, and also them that be vnder the earth, that is to say, the dead in purgatorie. Héerevppon Pope Clement tooke vpon him to commaund the Angels to proclaime his pardons, Apaena & culpa▪ at the sute of them that were marked for the Croyssie, he graunted thrée or four soules to be deliuered out of purgatory, which euery of them would desire. Whose rashnesse the diuines of the vniuersi∣tie of Paris were not afraid in those days to reproue and too correct. But by this description of the dragon, we may easly gather, that Satā cannot be vanquished by the power of mā, but only by the sword of Gods word and the shéeld of faithe, acording as ye Apostle Paul teacheth at large. Eph. 6. c. 16.17. 4. And his taile drevv the third part of the starres of heauen, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the vvoman that vvas ready to be deliue∣red: that as soone as she vvere deliuered of hir child, he might deuoure it.Who be the dragons tayle wherby Sa∣tan worketh most scathe. And his tayle drew the third part. &c. S. A serpent beareth his poison wherewith he infecteth, in his taile. Hereby is meant, that Satan hurteth chéefly by hipocrites and false prophets:
according to this text, The false prophet is the very tayle▪ Esay. 9. c. 14. And they that be of that sort, serue not the Lo Iesu Christ, but their owne bellies, and deceiue the harts of the simple by faire spéech and flatterie.Who be stars Rom. 16. c. 18. By thes therfore doth the dragon draw after him the third part of the Starres, that is to say, welnéere all the princes and noble men of the world, and all suche as are renoumed for birth, learning, or riches. And for asmuch as the number of false prophets shal increase toward the end of Antichrists reigne, more than euer they did afore: he shall draw so many the mo of the notabler sort after him.The force of Antichrists persecution. Moreouer when Antichriste shall be laid open to the world, and his head begin to be bro∣ken: then shall he streine all his sinewes, then shall he bestir himselfe: wherby it wil come to passe, that for feare of death, innumerable shall go after him, yea euen of them that are well séene in the truth: according as dayly experience tea∣cheth vs.Who be ye dra¦gons tayle. Also all those are his tayle, as many as haue taken their oth to be defenders of that sea, and as many as receyue fées, dignities, or offices at their hands, and as many as fall downe to the grounde worshipping him for a most holy fa∣ther and kissing his feete. And cast them to the earth. That is to say, he deceyued them by alluring them to the loue of earthly thyngs, and too despise the Gospell. The diuell then perceiuing himselfe to haue gotten so mighty an host of all states of the Church: prepareth himselfe to anoy the Church, vpon trust, as well of his owne puissance, as of the multi∣tude of hys reteyners. In respect whereof Iohn addeth immediatly:The incessnt moeuer of sa∣tan to anoy the Church. And the Dragon stood before the woman. S. This is one thing that Satan always séeketh: namely, how hée may kill the yong slippes of Christ and his Churche whyle they bée yet tender, before they may come to full growth. Moreouer the worde stoode, is put in forcingly: as if a man should saye, he waiteth wistly, he neuer goeth awaye, he ga∣peth vpon hir with open mouthe: and to be short, he doth all that is possible eyther to make the womā lose hir children by
deliuerance before hir time, or else to deuoure them when they be new borne and as yet but babes in faith, before they may come to their ful growth: namely eyther by egging thē away by promises, or by scaring them away by threatnings: according to this saying, they beléeue for a while, and shrinke backe againe in time of trial. Luke. 8. b. 13. To this end do the masters of the inquisition for heresie,The masters of the inquisi∣tion for here∣sie. diligently lay watch to procure the burning vp of the bookes that be written against his vsurping of that power, and against the abuse of that v∣surped power, and to restrain the reading of them, & to kéepe men from héering sermons of the gospel. To cōclude, the pe∣stilēt dragō leaueth nothing vnattempted, but laboreth with tooth and nayle, that Christ shoulde not be borne at all, or at leastwise that he shoulde not come to full growth in mens harts. That assoone as she were deliuered of hir Child,Satans en∣deuer to disa∣poynt the ef∣fect of Gods worde. he myght deuoure it. That is to say, that he might dispossesse and disap∣point the word of the Gospell whiche men had conceiued in their harts. For when Satan perceiueth, that he cannot let, but that the word is preached, heard, yea and also conceiued in some mēs harts: he indeuereth at leastwise, either to choke the séede cōceiued, or else to deuoure it assoone as it beginneth to shew itselfe: like as Christe saith of some in the Gospell: The séede that is sowed by the high way side, are they that heare the word, and afterward commeth the Diuell & taketh away the word out of their harts, least they should beleeue and be saued. Luke. 8. b. 12. 5. And she brought foorth a man child, that should rule all Nations vvith an yron rod: and hir chyld vvas caught vp vnto God and vnto his throne. And she brought foorth a man child.Who be me children. G. Although Satan inde∣uer by his naughtinesse and wilinesse, to hinder the happie childbearing of the Church: yet is the Churche not only deli∣uered, but also deliuered of a man child. That is to saye, she hath brought foorth either Christ in the harts of the faithfull,
(according to this saying of the Apostle, vntill Christe be fa∣shioned in you againe, Gal. 4. c. 19.) or else some other excel∣lent man, to whome Satan and his false prophets are fayn to giue place very much. Of which sort were Paule, Steuen, Apollo, and such other like in old time. And also Athanasius, Iohn Chrisostome, Ambrose, and Austin. And furthermore Iohn Hus, and many notable and learned men in our times, of whom some hauing well discharged their duties, are falne a sléepe in the Lord, and othersome no whit inferior to them in learning and godlinesse, are aliue at this day, and by wry∣ting, teaching and exhorting do make war no lesse stoutly than luckely vnder the standerd of Christ, against the tyran∣nie of Antichrist: whose names we woulde ad to those afore∣said, but that the notable fame of their workes purchaceth them immortalitie sufficiently. S. But it is to be considered, that Iohn thought it not ynough to say a Child, except he had also added Man to it. q. d. Albeit that Satan and all the vngod∣ly be against ye Church: yet is she deliuered by Christs helpe, and not only deliuered, but also bringeth foorth a man childe, that is to say a liuely & lusty child, such a one as shall put the dragon to his plunge. G. For Christ is he that must crush the serpents head. Gen. 3. c. 15. He is the king of glory, the mightie and strong Lord, the Lord mightie in battel. Psa. 24. c. 8. And also, the mightie, the wonderfull, the Counseller. Esay. 9. b. S. which should win the well fortifyed and wel defended hold, and cast out the vsurper, and deuide the spoyle. Luk. 11. c. 21. Euen so as many as be led by the spirit of Christe, are men children, and stout felowes, and far too strong for the Diuell and the world. Héerevpon Iohn saith, I haue written vntoo you yong men, that you be strong, and that the word of God dwelleth in you, and yt you haue ouercome ye euil one. 1. Iohn. 2. b. 14.Christes rod, mace, or scep∣ter. That should rule al Nations. Christ hath receyued all po∣wer of God, that he myghte be the Lorde of all men, and be knowen so to bée. Math. 11. d 27. &. 28. d. 18. & Iohn. 13. a. 3. &. 17. b. 10 & Rom. 14 b. 9. with an yron rod. B. This is spoken in re∣spect
of Christs enimies, which had leuer to be broken in pée∣ces, than to submit themselues to his obeysance. For other∣wise Christ is most méeke and very swéete: howbeit that is to ye lowly, that is to the godly, that is to such as acknowledge their owne wretchednesse, & séeke their saluation in the name of him. Therefore the yron rod doth rightly betoken Gods word: both bicause it is vnable to be bowed or bent, & also by∣cause it tameth, breaketh, and subdueth all things. 2. Cor. 10. a. 4.5.6.7. Whervnto as many of al nations are obedient, as are foreordeined vnto lyfe: and the rest are faine to yéeld to it whither they will or no. For how much soeuer the vngodly fret, kicke, and with furious violēce resist him, they are com∣pelled at lēgth to féele him their iudge, whom they refuse for their king: & finally they be dyuerse ways brokē in péeces, til they be made his footestoole. For will they nil they, they shall both here & obey ye saying which is writtē in ye Gospel, name∣ly, Go ye cursed into euerlasting fire. &c. Mat. 25. d. 41. Wher∣vnto perteineth also yt which the Apostle wryteth, of ye force & effectualnesse of Gods word, Heb. 4. c. 12. So reade we also of the word of God vnder ye figure of a rod or mace, in the Psal. 2 c. 9. &. 45. a. 3.4. &. 110. a. 2. And vnder the resemblance of a sword. Eph. 6. c. 17. &. Heb. 4. c. 12. It is a foly therfore, yea and the greatest rashnesse that can be, for any man to go about to deuour & swalow vp this word of God, which must reigne o∣uer kings & princes, realmes, countries, & nations, whither they wil or no. And hir child was caught vp vnto God.God defēdeth ye elect, though they seeme most abiect. G. When Satan & the vngodly wait like a sort of hungerstaruen dra∣gons & lions, to swalow vp & to deuour ye godly worshippers of God which beléeue the Gospell: God receiueth thē into his owne keping, & dealeth so with them, yt being bestowed out of gunshot, they aduance his glory further & further whom they aknowledge to be their only Sauior & redéemer: like as the psalm saithe, He yt dwelleth vnder ye couert of the highest shal abide vnder ye shadow of the almighty. Psa. 91. a. 1. Also, they yt trust in ye Lord, shall dwel for euer like as mount Sion shall not be
moued. Psal. 125. a. 1. And the Lorde saith by his prophet: hée that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye. Zachar. 2. c. 8. And vnto his Throne. A. For asmuch as the names of the chozen are written in heauen from before the foundations of the world were laid, Luke. 10. d. 20. & Eph. 1. a. 4. & Phil. 4. a. 3. the Lord doth so care for them, cherish them, loue them, & defend them, as if they reigned with him presently, & were already indewed with immortall glorye and euerlasting blissednesse. P. Héerevpon come these sayings of the Apostle: he hath raysed vs vp togither with him, he hath made vs too sit togither with him amōg the heauenly company in Christ Iesu. Eph. 2. b. 6. And, our conuersation is in heauen. Phil. 3. d. 20. And, séeing ye be risen againe with Christ, séeke yée the things that are aboue, where Christe is sitting at the right hand of God. Coloss. 3. a. 1. A. All which things are spoken to the sigular comfort of the godly, to the end they may know, that they be already saued by hope, although they séem to be most abiect and wretched in the sight of the world. 6. And the vvomā fled into the vvildernesse, vvhere she hath a place prepared by God: that they may feede hir there, a thousand tvvo hundred & threescore days. A fleeing in time of perse∣cuion,And the woman fled. A. Although the Churche knowe most certenly that God hath a care of hir, whose defence is more for hir safetie than all the power and fauor of men: yet not∣withstanding least she might tempt hir mainteiner and de∣fender, somtimes she fléeth when she is assayled by enimies, and yet for all that, she wayteth quietly for help at the Lords hands. S. So we reade that Moses fled for displeasure of ye king of Egipt, and abode priuily with his father in law Iethro the preest of the Madianites, by the space of fortie yéeres. Exod. 2. d. 21. And also that Dauid and his company hid themselues in caues of mountaines for feare of Saules displeasure. 1. Sam. 19. b. 12. And also that Elias hid himselfe out of the way y the space of thrée yéeres and a halfe, to eschew the wrath
of Iezabell. 3. Kings. 19. a. 3. Likewise, the hundred Prophetes of the Lorde whom Abdias had hid in two caues for feare of the same Iezabell. 3. Kings. 18. a. 4. Concernyng which men looke also Hebr. 11. g. 38. So did the Lordes Disciples shet the dores too them & kéepe themselues out of the way for a time: Iohn. 20. e. 19. Paule being let downe in a basket by the bro∣thers at Damasco, went a side for a while into Arabie. Act. 9. d. 25. Finally who is ignorant of the hydings of Athanasius, and of other Catholik Bishops in the time of the persecution stird vp by the Arians, and moreouer of many fathers in E∣gypt which sought the innermost couerts of the wildernesses, by reason of the vngraciousnesse of the same tymes. Of whō Eusebius writeth manie things in the fourth Chapter of his eleuenth booke of the stories of the Churche. And as for our owne times, what shoulde wée speake much of them, conside∣ring that vnder godly Magistrates and Princes, there be mē of singular godlinesse and learning in the eyes of all mē, who being driuen out of their owne Churches, haue rather chozen too earne a poore liuing with the harde and vnacquainted la∣bour of their handes, than too serue vnder Antichrist for fat benefyces as they terme them.The Papists do bothe dyte and whine. And yet dare those Archpilats which vaunt themselues of the name of cleargimen, and Re∣ligious men, yea and of the name of the spiritualtie and of the Church, whereas in verie déede they bée the gard of An∣tichrist, and do nothing else but murther the godly continual∣ly: euen they (I say) dare expounde all the things to be ment of themselues, which the Scripture hath spoken of the perse∣cution of the Church, (that is too say of the godly) vnder Anti∣christ, and too complaine with wayling voyce, as though they suffered gréeuous things and farre vnséeming their estate at the handes of Heretikes: wherin they deale not much vnlike Esops woolf, which found fault with ye Lamb for troubling of the riuer,See the blind¦ness of the world. when he himselfe drunk of the vpper part of the streame. And yet these men, these deceiuers and mockers, finde a great sort, not of the common people onely, but euen
of great men and noble men also, who for al their liuing in so great wealth, pride, & superfluitie, do notwithstanding great∣ly pitie them, as though they were verie hardly delt withall. But Christ will iudge betwixt vs one daye, in whose sighte they dare commit these things so shamelesly.What it is to flee into wil∣dernesse. G.S.M. Also the Church flyeth into the wyldernesse, when it shunneth the in∣tycementes of this world by the vtter renouncing of it selfe, where through it is saued from the Dragon that pursueth it. Like as (in Daniel) Edom, Moab, and the border of the chil∣dren of Ammon are saued from the hoste of the King of the North, bycause they dwell in the Mountaines: and contrari∣wise Egiptians, Lybians and Ethyopians must come vnder his subiection, bycause the landes that they inhabite are well peopled and pleasant.The riche and delicate are a pray for Anti∣christ. Daniel. 11. g. 41. whereby the Prophet ment too doe vs to vnderstande, that such as giue themselues wholly too heaping vp of riches and too pleasures, shall bée a pray for Antichriste, and that the despyzers of suche things, which lead a hard and painfull lyfe, shall escape his handes. VVhere she hath a place prepared of God.Comfort a∣gainst all ad∣uersities and ses. G. Héere is ministred right large matter of comfort to al ye godly which endure ba∣nishment, losse of goods, & such other like things for Christes sake. For although they go wandering & straying abrode, yea & be despized of ye world, in so much as they be faine to forsake their owne Countries: yet notwithstanding the Lorde who hath vndertaken to looke to them, will no where forsake thē but prepareth lodging for them euen in the furthest countries of the world, & bringeth to passe that they may bée quietly fed both with spiritual foode, (that is to say with ye woord of God) and also with bodily foode. Then is it not by chaunce or for∣tune, but by Gods prouidence, that the faithful be sent of God into diuers parts of the world, that the inhabitantes of those coūtries vnto which the godly do resort, may héere the word of the Lord at their hand, & be brought too the knowledge of ye Gospell, frō the ydols to which they were addicted afore. That they may seede hir there. S.G. Iohn alludeth to ye storie of Elias,
who flying for feare of Iezabels displeasure, hid himselfe in ye house of a widow a countriwoman of his, & there was fed by the space of two yéeres and a half. 3. Kings. 17. a. 9. So also the Church of the Apostles being driuē from among the Iewes, remoued to ye Gentils by whō it was fed all the while. And truly how forward ye Gentils were to minister things néede∣full to the preachers of Gods word, Paule sheweth, writing in this wise. If it had bin possible, ye would haue plucked out your owne eyes, & giuen them vnto me. Galat. 4. b. 15. what cōmendation he giueth to the reward which the Philippians bestowed vpō him. Also Phi. 4. d. 18. A thousand two hūdred & threescore dayes. M.S. That is to say, al the while yt the persecu∣tiō of Antichrist is whot: which thing the scripture declareth euerywhere to be but short. Such a time is betokened also in ye storie of Elias, whervnto Iohn séemeth to haue had an eye. By reason wherof the scripture is wont to promise ye godly length of life euen here also: and contrariwise to threaten the wicked, that their dayes shal be shortened by the one halfe. 7. And there vvas fought a [great] battell in heauē: Michael and his Angells fought vvith the dragon, and the dragon, and his Angells fought. And ther was fought a great battel. G. When ye Lord mindeth to delyuer his people out of any daunger, he is wont to vtter his force ageinst his enemyes, too put thē too shame. Michael (which is interpreted, who is as God, or God that striketh) is sent to vanquish and destroy all the Lords enemies, and spe∣cially at suche tyme as Satans Kingdome ryseth too vehe∣mently against the kingdome of Christ. S. Therfore when the Churche is hidden in wildernesse from the syght of the Dra∣gons wrathfull dyspleasure, then comes hir Champion and defender Michaell, that stoute knyghte of his hands Dauid, euen Christ our Lord & sauior:The Church is called hea∣uen. than who there is none stron∣ger, neither in heauen nor on earthe. For who is lyke God? In Heauen. The Churche which consisteth of the Gentiles
dispersed, and yet is both chozen and predestinated by God, is rightly called heauen, according too this text. But the Ierusa∣lem which is from aboue, Gal. 4. d. 26. Out of which, Satan was too bée cast, whom it erst worshipped vnwittingly: to the intent that hereafter, leauing their foule errors and earthly desires, they might sauour heauenly things, and haue theyr myndes dwelling in heauen, according as Paule saythe, our conuersation is in heauen. Psalm. 3. d. 20. Also, sauour yée the things that bée aboue, Coloss. 3. a. 2. Sathan therfore is sayde too bée cast out of heauen, when he is cast out of mens harts, and hath lost his seruice there. Michael and his Angels foughte with the Dragon. Michaell (who in the Prophete is called a Great prince,Christ and all godly Prin∣ces. and is sayd too stand on Gods peoples side Dan. 10. d. 21. representeth vntoo vs Christ: B. whose Angells bée both those holy seruisable spirties, and also (among men) the godly Princes and Magistrates togither, with the ministers of Gods worde, which serue Christ our Sauiour in vanqui∣shing the huge powers of Antichristes host.Who be the dragōs cham∣pions, & what his weapons bee. And the dragon & his Angells fought. A. The Angells whose force the Dragon vseth ageinst Michael, are the great men, wysemen, & weal∣thy men of the world: whose puissance, policie, and riches are the weapons that he fighteth with, for the maintenance of his kingdome and honour, which he hath vsurped wrongful∣ly. With him must wée also incounter, howbeit with spiri∣tuall armour from God, according as the Apostle saithe. 2. Cor. 10 a. 4. &. Ephe. 6. c. 13. Also wée haue a Michaell, that is too say Christ, a champion too fight for vs, by whom wée shall get the vpper hand, and he shall also giue vs the garlande of victorie.Why the bat∣tll betweene Christ & Sa∣tan is sayd to be great. By the way it is to bée marked, that this battell is called great, first in respecte of the multitude of the feighters. for on the one side stand all the faithfull, and on the other side all the vnfaithfull. And secondly in respect of the tyme: for it began at the beginning of the world, and shall holde on vntoo the ende of the world: A. like as the Lorde foretolde when he sayd too the serpent, I will set enmitie betwixt thée and the
woman, and betwixt thy séede and hir séede. The séede of hir shall breake thy head, and thou shalt byte the héele of it. Gen. 3. c. 15. G. Also Paule sayth: like as at that time he which was borne after the flesh, persecuted him that was borne after the spirit: euen so is it now also, Galath. 4. d. 29.The maner of the saide bat∣tell. And this battell consisteth of full contrarietie of wills and works. The faith∣full fight with true and liuely faith, and by the word of God, which is inuincible: and the aduersaries make resistance, armed with vnbeléefe and lyes. The children of God are fen∣ced with sobernesse, myldnesse, patience, comfortablenesse, & forewardnesse of dooyng good too all men. But the Dragon taketh to him that which is peculiar too himselfe. For like as he is a murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth: euen so he abuseth the swordes of Kings, the Lawes of Senates, and the cheynes, prisons, & bandes of the iudges of this world, too torment and trouble the deuout worship∣pers of God withall by all meanes, who notwithstandyng are neuer ouercome by force of torments, but euermore get the vpper hand, and tread the foule féend hymselfe and all his armie vnder their feete, through the gift of faith: accordyng as is added by and by. 8. But they preuayled not: neyther vvas their place found any more in heauen. But they preuailed not. S.How the diuel is driuen out of heauē, that is to say, out of the harts of the faythfull. This place confirmeth that which Christ, speaking of the Church, said vntoo Peter: The gates of Hell shall not preuaile ageinst it. Math. 16. c. 18. Neyther was their place founde. &c. The Dragon is vanquished and driuen out of the kingdome of heauen, that is too say, out of the harts of Gods childrē, by Michael, that is too say by Christ according as it is sayde in the Gospell, I sawe Satan fal∣ling downe from heauen as it were lightening, Luke. 10. c. 18. Also, now is the iudgement of this world, now shall ye Prince of this worlde bée cast out. Iohn. 12. e. 31. B. Also, the Prince of this worlde is iudged alreadie. Iohn. 16. b. 11. And the Apostle
saith. Forasmuch as the children were partakers of flesh and blud, he himself likewise toke part with them, yt by death he might put away him that had Lordship ouer death, that is to say the Diuell, &c. Hebr. 2. d. 14. A. As oft then as the power of Christs death is shewed, & the preaching of his word caught hold on by faith: so oft must Satan needes be cast out. For in sted of Idolatrie and superstition, there florishe true Religiō & godlinesse. In sted of fleshly reason which bare all the sway afore, now is the holy Ghost present, who inlighteneth mās minde and turneth the euill will of man vnto good, vnclean∣nesse is driuen away, & holinesse of life comes in: To be short, the whole man being borne agein of the séede of Gods word, beareth fruite, not to the flesh (as erst) nor to the world, nor to the Diuell, but to the holy Ghost. 9. And that great Dragon vvas cast out, [euen] that olde Serpent, vvhich is called the Diuell and Satan, as vvhich deceiueth all the vvorld: and he was cast out in∣to the earth, and his Angels vvere cast out vvith him. Earthly folk.And that great Dragō. P. By the earth are ment such men as sauer earthly things, & as are borne of ye Diuel, which tast al∣together of the earthe, which féede of the earth, which trayle with their brestes vpō the earth, which hold scorne of Gods truth, & imbrace the lies of their father the Diuell. G. For the diuell perceiuing he cannot ouercome the faithfull which are furnished with heauēly armor, riseth vp more fercely ageinst those whō he séeth giuē to earthly lustes, & holdeth thē as his owne inheritance, according as Paul teacheth, Eph. 2. a. & .2. Tim. 2. d. 26. That old Serpent.Great neede hd we then to be well ware of him. M.G. Satā is called so, bicause he alwayes hath venim in a readines to poisō mē to death. More ouer it is euē verie be which at this day laboreth to kepe men frō the heauēly paradise, frō whence he himself fell, like as he draue our first parents out of ye Paradise of pleasure: & ther∣fore it stands vs wretches yt be borne in sin greatly on hande to bée well ware of him, séeyng he was able too doo so much a∣geinst
our first fathers whē they were yet happie & cléere frō al spot of sin. VVhich is called the Diuel. S. That is to say, a slaū∣derer,Slanderer. as shal be said more at large in the next verse. And Sa∣tanas. B That is to say, an aduersarieAduersarie. or withstander, bycause that by al meanes he withstandeth Gods purpose, M. namely of restoring ye chozen sort by Christ: A. and also bicause he coū∣selled the first man & woman to do contrarie to Gods worde frō the beginning, Gene. 3. a. 4.5.What is ment heere by the whole world. VVhich deceiueth the whole world. M. That is to saye, all the reprobates dispersed through the whole world. A. And he deceiueth thē with his falsehods, sights, & lies, according to this text,Satās sham∣lesse suttletie, falshod, and lying. He is a lyer & the father of lying. Iohn. 8. f. 44. For being shamelesse, he is not afraide to beare mē in hand, that he is God, that is to say, a benefactor & preseruer of such as serue him, whereas in very déede he is a destroyer of them. Likewise agein he is no whit afrayde too blame God of vntruth and enuiousnesse towardes his wor∣shippers, A. according to the example yt we alledged right now out of the first booke of Moses. wherevpon Paule saith too the Corinthians, I am afraide least it should come to passe, that like as the Serpent deceyued Eue wyth hys wylinesse, euen so your mindes should bée led away frō the simplicitie which was in you to Chrystward. 2. Cor. 11. a. 3. And in another place concernyng Antichryst he wryteth thus: whose comming is accordyng to the woorking of Satan, with al power, & signes, and lying myracles, and wyth all deceyte of vnrighteous∣nesse, in them that perishe. 2. Thessa. 2. c. 9.The diuell is ouercome by Christe & hs faythfull ser∣uants. And he was cast out intoo the Earthe. S. That is too saye, he was berefte of hys po∣wer, discharged of his roome, abandoned to contempt and re∣proche, & consequently to bée trāpled vnder foote: accordyng to this scripture, thou shalt walk vpō the Adder & the Cocka∣trice, & tread vpon the Lyon and the Dragon. Psalm. 91. c. 13. Also, the séede of ye womā shal break thy head. Gen. 3. c. 15. Al∣so, behold, I giue you power to treade vpō serpentes & scorpi∣ons, & vpon al power of enmitie, and nothing shall hurt you. Luk. 10. c. 19. Also s. Iames saith, submit your selues vnto god
and withstand the diuell, and he will flée from you, Iames. 4. b. 7. Then is the diuel cast into the earth, to the end he should depart from the faithfull, & only anoy those that prefer earth∣ly things before heauenly things, B. and despise Gods truthe when it is offered them. And his Angels were cast out with him. A. Although the wicked be intermedled with the godly & faith∣full as long as Christs Church dwelleth vpon earth:The reproba∣tes doo rather further Chri∣stes kingdome than hinder it by their perse∣cutions and troubles. yet are the reprobates so little able too anoy ye elect or to hinder their saluation, that they rather euen vnwillingly & vnwittingly further it. For we know that the persecutions wherwith the wicked doo rage ageinst the children of God, is a certein way to go to the kingdome of heauen. Act. 14. d. 22. &. Rom. 8. d. 17. & 2. Timo. 2. b. 11.12. And therefore vnto suche as loue God, all things worke to the best, namely in such as are called accor∣ding to his purpose. Rom. 8. e. 28. Forasmuch then as the vn∣godly cānot hurt the chozen, but may do thē good: they are said to be cast out with their Prince Satā, as in respect of power to do harme: so as now the faithfull néede not to feare the di∣uel, nor the wicked, nor ye whole world, but only God who is able to destroy both body & soule into hell fire. Math. 10. c. 28. 10. And I herd a loud voyce saying, novv is saluati∣on, & strēgth, & the reigning of our God, & the power of his Christ brought too passe in heauen, For the ac∣cuser of our brethren is cast dovvne, vvhiche accused them in the presence of our God day and night. The ioy of the godly for the deliuerance of the Church.And I herd a loud voyce, saying. G. The faithfull cannot but be greately glad, when they thinke vpon Gods goodnesse, wher∣by their sorest enemie Satan is vanquished and confounded. S Here then is a caroll or song of victorie and reioycing of the Church that triumpheth for the vanquishing & casting down of the Dragon. Which thing may be referred either to ye time of Titus & Vespasian, who reuenged ye Church of hir cruellest enemies the Iewes: or also to the time of Constantine when ye persecuters of the christē faith were destroyed & banished ye
Romane Empire, & the Churches set again in quietnesse. Al∣so to the time of the Emperour Iouinian after the deathe of Iulian the Apostata, of whom Eusebius treateth in his ele∣uēth booke of ye stories of ye Church. Now is saluation.Saluation. A. Where vnrighteousnesse reigneth vnto sinne, there damnatiō taketh place. For the hire of sin is death. Ro. 6. d. 23. but whereas the Gospell is receiued, & men giue themselues to vpright dea∣ling, there is saluation and life. In respect whereof the word of the Lord is commonly called the word of saluation and e∣ternal life. Eph. 1. c. 13. & Phi. 2. c. 16. & Iames. 1. c. 21. And strēgth.Strength. Not the strength of mē, but of God, according to this text, the right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength. Psal 118. c. 16. And the reigningReigning. of our God .M. Namely in them, in whom the diuell reigned héeretofore. And the powerPower. of his Christ. For Christs power shineth foorth most of all by remorse of sinne & amendment of life. S. The effect is, that as long as Satan, sinne, deathe, hell, and damnation reigned, God séemed to be weake, as one that were not able to help his worshippers. But now after that Christe is risen from the dead, & hath be∣gon to reigne in his kingdome whiche his father hath besto∣wed vpon him, there is wrought saluation against damnati∣on, strēgth against ye weaknes of death, reigning against be∣ing in bondage to sin, & almighty power against the force of Satan, yea & against the gates of hell. Brought to passe in hea∣uen. That is to say in the Churche, wherevnto is giuen the power of binding & losing. Mat. 16. c. 19. &. .18. c. 18. And also the cōuersation therof is heauēnly. Phi. 3. d. 20.Of accusation and slaunder. For the accuser of our brethren is cast downe. M. It is the peculiar propertie of the diuel to accuse, & also (if he can) to bring those in daunger of damnation, whom he mistrusteth shal climb vp and become Citizens & heires of the heauenly kingdome from whence he himself fel. And what else doth this suttle shifting enimie at this day, but slaunder and accuse the brethren, namely to the mightie tyrants of the world, yea and to godly magistrates also, to the intent they should put them to death: like as hée
slaundered euen our Sauiour with this point, namely that he sought to raise an insurrectiō of the people & to make him∣selfe king. Luk. 23. a. 2. A. Here is to be marked, that al slande∣rers which charge their brethren with false crimes, are the diuels instrumēts, whose propertie it is to accuse ye brethren, & to speake lies. Such were they that said vnto Steuen, This mā cesseth not to speake blasphemous words against this ho¦ly place & against the law. Acts. 6. d. 13. Such a one was Ter∣tullus ye Orator, which would haue charged Paule the Apo∣stle with a notorious crime before the President Faelix. We haue found this man (saith he) a pestilent felow & a mouer of debate vnto al ye Iewes through the world, & a mainteiner of the sect of the Nazarites, who hath also gone about to defyle ye Temple. &c. Act. 24. b. 5.6. Suche also were they that drew Paule & Silas into ye market sted, saying to the magistrates, These mē trouble our Citie, & whereas they be Iewes, they preach ordināces which are not lawful for vs to receiue, nor obserue, seing we be Romanes. Act. 16. e. 20.21. Likewise they which said of ye same Apostle, This fellow perswadeth mē to worship God cōtrary to ye law. Act. 18. d. 13. Many at this day folow these seruants of Satā & craftsmasters of slanders, spa∣ring no mās good name, but disfaming all godly men before kings, princes, & magistrates, as schismatikes heretikes and rengates, for none other cause, but only to ye intent yt they themselues may fréely (that is to saye without gainesaying) serue Satā their prince, & runne headlong into damnation, without remorse of cōscience. O sorowful madnesse of men. In the presence of our God.Backbyting. Here is betokened Satās wicked∣nesse matched with shamelesnesse: as if Iohn should say, Sée ye shamelesnesse of Satā. He is not afraid to bakbite ye godly euē before him that is the beholder of all harts, as though hée either were ignorāt, or would suffer himselfe to be deluded. So did he bakbite the holy mā Iob, that he did serue God for ye felicitie of temporall things. Iob. 1.9.10. After this manner doth ye scripture oftētimes vpbraid the vngodly, for not being
afraid to commit their wicked & abhominable déedes shame∣lesly in ye sight or presence of God, frō whome nothing can be hid, & whose eyes behold ye sonnes of men in al places. A. For it is he only yt sercheth ye reines & harts of mē. 2. Chro. 6. e. 30. & Psa. 7. c. 9. S. So ye Pharisie standing in his own conceit, and being puffed vp with opiniō of his own righteousnesse, accu∣seth yea & condemneth the publicane euen in the presence of God. Luke. 18.11. But cōtrariwise the righteous mā accuseth himselfe first, & as for the doings of his brethrē, he either excu¦seth thē, or lesneth thē. A. For charitie (which is peculiar to the chozen) couereth the multitude of sinnes. 1. Pet. 4.8. Day and night.The diuel and hs impes con¦ster all things to the worst, and face out lyes euen whē they bee taken tardie. Vnwéeriable is the indeuer of Satan & his hangers on in this point, & wholly they bend thēselues herevnto: name∣ly, to bakbite the godly, & to cōster all their sayings & doings to ye worst: according as the examples of our days beare wit∣nesse. For who is able to vtter, how great lies, yea euē dead∣ly & open lies they deuise now adais against the preachers of the Gospell? Neyther are they ashamed of such lies, euē when they be taken tardie with the fault, as though they would o∣penly auouch this saying, we haue set lying to be our hope. &c. Esay. 28. d. 15. A. And we will be strengthned with our tungs: we be maisters of our owne lippes, who is our Lord? Psal. 12. a. 4. But like as mists be chaced away by the rising of the Sunne: so will the Lord one day make the righteous∣nesse of his seruants shine like the noone day, against the for∣ged slaunders of the wicked: according as it is written. Psal. 37. a. 6. & Esay. 58. c. 8. 11. And they ouercame him through the bloud of the Lamb, and by the word of his vvitnessing, and they loued not their life vnto the death. And they ouercame him through the bloud. q. d. S.They only be free which he grafted in Christ. They ouer∣came ye aduersary powers, not by their own strēgth or deser∣tes, but by the grace of our sauiour Christ. The bloud of the Lamb, yt is to say, ye beléef which they had of ye death of Christ,
hath made them get the vpper hand. Héereby we gather, that all those are still subiect to the power of Satan, whiche are not redéemed by the bloud of the Lamb: according to thys text, If the sonne make you frée, then shal you be frée indéede. Iohn. 8. e. 36. And, the bloud of his sonne Iesus Christ clen∣zeth vs from al sin.Christs bloud is auaylable to none but such as beleue in him. 1. Iohn. 1. c. 7. And by the word of his witnes∣sing. This is added by name, to do vs to wit, that the shéeding of Christs bloud auaileth vs not, otherwise than by beléeuing his word. There be many that boast themselues to be redée∣med by Christs bloud, when for all that, they refuse his Gos∣pel. But such men are deceiued, bicause it is only faithe that applieth Christs bloud vnto vs, to be our raunsome. Héere∣vpō Paul writeth to the Corinthians in this wise. And such were some of you: but ye be washed, but ye be sanctifyed, but ye be made righteous in the name of our Lorde Iesu, by the spirit of our God. 1. Cor. 6. b. 11. Then looke whome Chryste clenzeth with his bloud, thē doth he iustify by faith, and sanc∣tify by his spirit.Onely fayth ouercommeth the power of the Diuell. Also by this place we learn that the powers of the diuell are ouercome only by the shéeld of faith and the sword of Gods word, according as the Apostles teach. Eph. 6 17. & .1. Pet. 5. c. 9. Héere is no mention made of the signe of the crosse, nor of coniuring, nor yet of holywater, but only of Christs bloud, and of the word which he hath witnessed. The victory then which ouercommeth the world and the prince of the world, is euen our faith. 1. Iohn. 5. a. 4. And they loued not their life vnto the death.The true de∣niall of a mās selfe. B. That is to say, they made so greate account of the truth of the Gospell, that they refused not euē to suffer death for the maintenāce of it. This then is the true denying of a mans selfe, when the faithfull seruant of Christ is ready to suffer any thinges in defence of the doctrine of ye Gospel. And this is it that Christ meant whē he said, If any man come vnto me & hate not his father & his mother, & hys wife, & his childrē, & his brothers, & his sisters, yea & euen his own life: he cānot be my disciple. Luke. 14. f. 26. And againe, if any man wil come after me, let him denie himselfe and take
vp his crosse and folow me. Math. 16. d. 24. Also, he that loueth his life shal lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world, shall kéepe it vnto euerlasting life. Iohn. 12. d. 25. Also, be not afraid of them that kill but the body. &c. Math. 10. c. 28. 12. Therefore reioice ye heauens, and you that dwel in them. VVo to the inhabiters of the earth and of the Sea, for the diuel is come down vnto you, hauing great anger, bicause he knovveth he hath but a short tyme. Therefore reioyce ye heauens.The ioy of the godly for ouer comming the diuell. S. It is a surmounting spéeche rise in the scriptures. For to the intent he may expresse the greatnesse of the ioy, he calleth as wel ye very heauens which are things without life, as also the holy spirites that do seruis vnto God, & the holy mē of God which loue heauenly things, to the setting foorth & aduancing of Christes victorie. And you that dwell in them. q. d. Good cause haue you to be glad, whiche haue so preuayled against the diuell: for this famous victo∣rie shall bring excéeding great gladnesse to all Gods saincts. VVoe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea.The wret∣ched state of the reprobate in this life, and the ferce∣nesse of Sa∣tan bothe a∣gaynst them, and the godly. After Iohn hath declared the victorie of ye good men gotten by the bloud of Christ, now he describeth ye wretched state of ye wicked. For the diuell perceiuing himselfe to be disappointed and ouer∣come by the faithfull, wreaketh his téene the sorer and more vehemently vpon the faithlesse, least they might happen too scape his hands as the other did. For the diuell is come downe vnto you. That is to wit, by tempting you more féercely, and by holding you more streytly bound in your sinnes. Hauing great wrath. Namely for the great number that be taken a∣way from him by the preaching of the Gospell. S. As if hée should say, now that he is cast out of heauen, he will poure out all his wrath vpon you, after the manner of an yrefull man, who being prouoked to anger abroade, commeth home and poures it out vppō his owne houshold. Christ witnesseth that it happened after ye same maner to the Iewes. He taketh vnto him (saith he) seuen other féends worse than himselfe.
and entering into him, dwell there, and the end of that man becommeth worse than the beginning Luke. 11. d. 26. Moreo∣uer it séemeth to be a great wrath in this respect, that looke whome he made to erre héeretofore through ignorance, now after that Christ is exalted, and the Gospell published abrode in the world, he maketh them to starkle and to blaspheme e∣uen of spite. A. Concerning such forlorne men sée Hebr. 6. a. 4 & .10. c. 26. & .2. Pet. 2. d. 20. S. Also this séemeth to be spoken for the elects saks, who notwithstanding are yet still hild downe with their sinnes, to the intent they should the sooner amend. For Satan is afraid, least if the preaching of the word shuld haue good successe in the Church, many would turne to repē∣tance, and fall away from him: and therefore he laboreth by all meanes to hold them downe still, & to drowne thē deeper in their sinnes.The sundry wyles of Sa∣tan, and the continual war¦fare of the godly. Furthermore héere are opened vnto vs the sundry wiles of Satan, who is no sooner disappointed of one way of doing mischéefe, but he procéedes to a new assault a∣gaine by and by in the necke of it. As for examples sake, whē he winneth nothing by open tyranny, he makes a priuie as∣sault vpon vs by secret ambushes of heretikes vnder cloke of godlinesse: & if that way wil not serue his turne, he attempts the matter againe by opē force. Which thing is trimly pein∣ted out in the story of blissed Iob. 1. a. 1. G. For this cause, whē the faithfull find themselues to haue ouercome Satan in one incounter by the grace of Christ, let them take good héede that they imagin not their battel to be at an end: but rather let them buckle themselues to a new charge, and valiantly ad∣uance themselues to handstrokes againe For this aduersary stalketh about like a roring lion, seeking whome he may de∣uoure.The neerer tht the worlde dra∣weth to an end, the fier∣cer to Sa∣tan. 1. Pet. 5. c. 8. Bycause he knoweth he hath but a short tyme. q. d. Now he rageth the whotlier against you, and vttereth al his power, to seuer ye frō Christ, & to hold ye down from the life yt is in God, bicause he knoweth that doomesday is at hād: S. at which time the most vpright iudge of al, shal pronounce this vnauoidable sentence, Go ye cursed into euerlasting fire
prepared for ye diuel & his Angels. Mat. 25. d. 41. And therfore the diuels cried out, Alas, what hast thou to do with vs O Ie¦sus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy vs? Luke. 4. f. 34. A. And at another time they besought him that he would not command them to depart into ye déepe. Luk. 8. e. 31. Therfore the néerer that the world draweth to an end, and the further that Christs kingdome is aduanced by the preaching of the Gospel, so much ye néerer do they know the last iudgemēt day to be at hand: whereby it commeth to passe, that they applye themselues the more egerly and feruently to bring men too destructiō and damnation, that they may carrie many head∣long with thēselues into hell fire. Cōcerning whiche maner of people, looke. 2. Pet. 2. a. 2. & soforth throughout ye Chapter. 13. And vvhē the dragon savv himselfe cast out into the earth: he pursued the vvoman that had borne the manchild. And whē the dragon saw himselfe cast. &c. P.The incessant working and wiles of Sa∣tan. Iohn declareth yt Satā beareth vneschewable enimity against ye church: for ye more yt he is cast out to be ouercom, so much ye féercelier doth he multiply his wiles without cessing. S. Wherfore he cesseth not frō pursuing, no not euen whē he is vāquished & cast out, althogh he haue no power to hurt ye chosē, by reason yt Christ sheldeth & preserueth thē: who hath said of his own shéepe, no mā shal pluck thē out of my hād. Ioh. 10. e. 28. So we reade, yt Satā left christ himself for a time. Lu. 4. b. 13. So assaileth he ye Church with new tricks frō time to time, which none per∣ceiue but ye chozē: & whē he semeth to promis a truce, thē wor∣keth he mischéef priuily & traiterously. S. And truly since ye time yt the chéefe princes of ye world, (I méene the Romaine Em∣perors (receiued ye christē religiō & renoūced their Idols: per∣ceiuing now, that he cānot delude mākind by open Idolatry: such is his naughtines, that he sets his wits to ye practizing of other fetches: namely to kéepe stil ye cloke of christē professiō, not according to the single & pure rule of faith. G So when the
Churche was at some rest and quietnesse by reason of out∣ward peace: at suche time as the persecutors of the Gospell hild their hands, this most subtil enimie did set them at oddes among themselues, namely by vnderminers, false Apostles, and masters of forgerie, which vnder pretence of the truth of the Gospel filled the whole world with innumerable errors. Whereof the Apostles did warne the Churches diligently, as it is to be séene in the Acts. 20. f. 28. & Rom. 16. c. 17. & .2. Cor. 11. c. 13. & .2. Pe. 2. a. 1. &. 3. a. 2. & Iude. a. 4. Of which heresies we sée the prints remaining euen in these our times: the proofe whereof is too much apparant in the Anabaptists, Lucia∣nists, Libertines, and such like ministers of Satan, whiche had borne the man child. A. Looke ye fifth verse of this Chapter. 14. And there vvere giuē to the vvoman tvvo wings of a greate Eagle, that she mighte flye into the deserte place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and halfe a time, from the sight of the Serpent. The impreg∣nable preser∣uation of the Churche, and the vnweeria∣ble perseue∣rnce of the same.And there were giuen. &c. A. Christ doth alwayes preserue his Church, so as not euen the gates of hel be able to do any thing against hir. Mat. 16.18. Two wings. By some mēs iudge∣ment they betoken ye vnderstanding of the two Testamēts, wherby the Church styeth vp aloft, & easly escapeth ye raging floud of curious disputations, contenting hirselfe with ye sim∣ple word of God. Of a great Eagle. Although an Eagle flye a high: yet notwithstanding, he oftentimes stoopeth downe too the ground for his pray. Therfore the one of these wings sée∣meth to some mē to betoken the distrust in our owne strēgth, at what time we come downe into our selues, and perceyue how we be of no abilitie: And the other wing seemeth to beto∣ken trust in God, when we haue on the other side considered what we be in him: taking hold vppon the word of his pro∣mis by faith. Whereby it comes to passe, that we be weake in ourselues and strong in him, warranting nothing of our selues, but assuring ourselues of all things by him: according
as Paule saith, when I am weakened, then am I the stron∣ger. For the strēgth of God is made perfect in our weaknesse 2. Cor. 12. c. 9. And agein, I am able to do all things throughe Christ which strengtheneth me. Phili. 4. c. 13. But it is more plaine, to take the Eagles wings after the ordinarie maner of the scripture; for a certein vnwéeryable and (after a sorte) heauenly power, according to this saying of the Prophete, They that trust in the Lord shal chaunge their strength, they shall mount vp on wing as Eagles doe, they shall runne and not tyre, they shall walke and not be wéerie Esai. 4. d. 31. And ageine, Which filleth thy mouth with good: thy youth shall be renued as the Eagles. Psal. 103. a. 5. VVhere shee is nourished for a time, times, and halfe a time. B.The tyme of persecution is shortned for ye elects sake. He meaneth that the tyme of Antichristes persecution shall bée shortened for the electes sake, as it is written in Dani. 12. c. 7. Which thing the scrip∣ture beateth vpon continually, least the godly should bée dis∣mayed by sorenesse of persecutions. And therevpon procéede these spéeches of Gods seruantes: he will come out of hand and not linger. Habacuke. 2. a. 3. Also, the Lorde is at hande, Phili. 4. a. 5. And moreouer it is done too put the vngodly in feare, when they héere that their dominion is so néere at an end. So the Apostle Paule sayth, let them that vse this world be as though they vsed it not: and they that wéepe as thoughe they wept not. &c. For the fashion of this world passeth away 1. Cor. 7. e. 31. Séeke the exposition of the rest of this verse, out of the sixth verse of this chapter. 15. And the Serpent did cast vvater as it vvere a ry∣uer out of his mouth after the vvoman, that he might cause hir to be caught of the streame. And the Serpent did cast water. &c.The Philoso∣phicall and so∣phisticall dis∣putations of the heretikes, and the cruelty of persecuters. It is certein that the doc∣trine of the Gospel, whē it is blowē a brode by force of the ho∣lie Ghoste, is compared too a raging streame of water which no man is able to withstande, according as Christ sayth, He that beléeueth in mée as the scripture hath said, streames of
liuing water shal flow out of his belly. Iohn. 7. f. 38. After th same maner also do the Philosophicall and brabling disputa∣tions of heretikes breake in, like a raging water flud to tum∣ble downe the mindes of the simple sort. Which thing hath happened too many by the meanes of the Archhereticke Ari∣us and his complices: accordyng as Eusebius witnesseth in the stories of the Church. Also the rage of persecutions may bée vnderstoode by the name of ryuer, accordyng to this saying: They had euen then swalowed vs vp quicke: when their furie was in the rage, then had the waters euen ouer∣whelmed vs: the riuer had passed ouer our soule. Psal. 124. a. 2.3.4. The Serpent therefore doth then cast a great water∣streame out of his mouth, when he pronounceth sentence of Heresie against the godly, when he excommunicateth them, when he curseth thē, when he armeth the Magistrate ageinst them, and such other like things, and lastly when he persecu∣teth them with open defyance. That he myght cause hir to bee caught of the streame. That is too say, that by the violence and force of his most sharpe disputations, and by the rigor of per∣secutions on the otherside, he myght make hir too bée caryed away from the plaine beléefe in the Mediator Christ, vntoo pernicious trecherie. 16. And the earth helped the vvoman, and the earth opened hir mouth, & swalowed vp the streame hich the Dragon had cast out of his mouth. The diuers rescowings of the Churche. Christ.And the earth helped the woman. &c. M. This place is woont too bée expounded diuersly. By the earth that helped the wo∣mā, some vnderstand Christ, who is represented by the earth in respecte of hir stablenesse. And he is said too help ye Church, when he receyueth hir prayers, and suffereth hir not too bée ouerwhelmed with the multitude and abundance of waters, that is too say, of troubles. S. Othersome doo by that terme vn∣derstand the castawayes,The Casta∣wayes. who profite the Church in this be∣halfe, that the Church taking warning by their fal & destruc∣tion,
may take héede to hir selfe, that shée bée not seduced, & so perishe as well as they.Abolishing & confuting of heresies. Othersome take it to bée ment of the abolishing and confuting of many heresies, which was doone in diuerse councells, as in the Councell of Nice vnder ye Em∣peror Constantine, vnto which Councel resorted the holy and godly men out of all the earth, and condemned ye opiniō of Ar∣riusArius. with the Author of it. Also in the counsell of Constanti∣nople Eunomius & MacedoniusEunomius & Macedonius. folowers of the errors of Ar∣rius were cōdēned likewise. Also the vngraciousnesse of Ne∣storius was cōdēned in ye councel of Ephesus. The reprobate dotages of Eutiches and DioscorusEutiches and Dioscorus. were condemned in the councell of Chalcedon. And after this manner they expounde the helping of the woman by the earth.The sodeyn destruction of the enimies of the church. But more rightly doo others take this place to bée ment of the sodeine and vnwist destruction of the enemies of the Church: namely when the persecuters of the godly bée taken out of the world by sodein deathe, euen in the middes of all their practizes, and returne into ye earth out of which they came, and wherof their whole lyfe hath sauored: as appéereth by Herod,Herod. Act. 12. d. 23. and by Iulian the Emperor, and many other Emperors,Iulian the Apostata. according also as we haue shewed more largely héeretofore in the sixth Chapter. And Iohn alludeth too the sodeyne and horrible de∣struction of CoreeCoree. and hys companie, whome the holye sto∣ries declare too haue béene swalowed vp quicke intoo the earthe, for making insurrection ageynst the Church of God. Numbers. 16. e. 32. 17. And the Dragon vvas vvrothe ageinst the vvo∣man, and vvent his vvay to make vvarre vvith the resi∣due of hir seede, vvhich keepe the commaundementes of God, and haue the vvitnesse of Iesus Christ. And the Dragon was wroth ageinst. &c. M.The vnappea¦sable spite of Satan to∣wardes the Church. Although Satā bée not able by any meanes to ouercome the Church: yet ceasseth he not to spyght it, and to imploy all his force to anoy it some way or other. And so albeit he bée vanquished & confounded:
yet shrinketh he not at all, but giueth a newe onset vpon the womans séede. VVith the residew of hir seede. G. Satan percei∣uing himself vnable to ouercome the Church with hir errors and heresies, bicause it is fenced with the inuincible truth of Gods word: pricketh the kings and Princes of the earth vn∣to open persecution, that he maye turne aside the weake sort from the vnitie of the Church and the confession of ye faith by feare of punishment.The cause why Satan rageth most. VVhich keepe the commaundementes of God. S. This is one thing why Satan rageth most, name∣ly bicause he sées himself despised, and God worshipped of the faithfull. A. Neither is there any other cause of the cruell per∣secution at this day, than for that the godly setting lyght by mens traditiōs, indeuor to yelde due seruice vnto God alone, that is to say, to kéepe his commaundementes according too the grace that is giuen vnto them. For they know howe that concerning such as sticke in mens traditions, the truth sayth, They worship mée in vaine, teaching doctrines of mennes bringing vp. Math, 15. b. 9. And haue the witnesse of Iesu Christ. M.What it is to keepe Gods commaunde∣ments. That is to say, they professe the Catholike faith, beléeuyng that Christ was made mā, and that he appéered too put away the workes of the Diuel, that is to wit sin, death, and so conse∣quently the whole dominion of Satan. 1. Iohn. 3. a. 5. A. Iohn séemeth to expound héere, what it is too kéepe Gods comman∣dements: least any man might flatter himself without faith, as though he might thinke that the kéeping of Gods commā∣dementes consisted in outward things. For the groundworke must bée fetcht from faith, if we bée desirous to haue oure doo∣ings accepted of God. For whatsoeuer is not of faithe, is sin. Rom. 14. d. 23. And in Christ Iesu neither circumcision auay∣leth aught neither vncircumcision, but faith which worketh by loue Gal. 5. a. 6. Also, this is his commaundment, that wée should beleue in the name of his sonne Iesu Christ, and loue one another as he hath willed vs. 1. Iohn. 3. d. 23. In vain then boast the Hypocrites, in vaine boast the Iewes, in vain boast the Papistes of the kéeping of Gods commaundementes, sée∣ing
they holde scorne of his sonne, whom God hath apppoin∣ted too bée the onely teacher and guyde of the Church, Math. 17. a. 5. 18. And I stoodevpon the sand of the Sea. And I stoode. &c. E.M. Some copies haue it,The tickle stā¦ding of Sa∣tan. And he stoode vp∣on the sand of the Sea, so as it should bée referred vnto Satan and not vnto Iohn, in this sense: Namely that Satans en∣terprises are to no purpose, in likewise as they haue no stedi∣nesse which séeke a stedfast foundation vpon the sand. Math. 7. d. 26. Contrariwise wée reade that Christ and his chozen do stand vpon a Mountaine. Hereafter .14. a. 1. A. But if wée reade it in the first person, wée must saye it is a certeine pre∣paration to the vision ensuing, which Iohn is about to shewe in the beginning of the next Chapter. The thirtenth Chapter. ANn I savve a beast clymbing vp out of the Sea, ha∣uing seuen heades and tenne hornes, and vpon his hornes tenne Crovvnes, and vpon his heades a name of blasphemie. ANnd I sawe. A.The proud kingdome of Antichrist. The proude and presumptuous kingdome of Antichrist is described at large in this Chapter, wherein we shall sée the cho∣sen to be so greatly regarded of God, that they can not bée seduced by any deceytes: howbeit that their faith and patience must néedes bee first tryed by dy∣uers tribulations, ere they can haue quiet rest with Christ. G. And this vision is taken out of the prophesie of Dan. 7. a 3. B. which cunningly describeth the persecution of the Churche that shall bée in the time of Antichrist: which shall bée much greuouser than all the reste that went before A Beast.A beast. Satan the old enemie is oftentimes resembled vnder the shape of a
serpent in respecte of his wilynesse, bycause he sheadeth his poyson with faire smooth speaking: and oftentymes both hée and also the gracelesse tyrantes the enimies of Gods people, which are stirred vp by him, are betokened by the name of Dragon.Antichristes clymbing. Climbing vp. S. That is too say, exalting it self aboue all that is called or worshipped for God, according as the A∣postle teacheth. 2. Thess. 2. b. 4. Or else héerby it is signified, that Antichryst shall créepe vp from a verie bace degrée vnto high authoritie.A description of the large∣nesse and pui∣sance of Anti∣christs domi∣nion. Out of the sea. In Daniell the fourthe beast is séene more terrible than the reste, rysyng out of the sea, whome hée reporteth anon after to ryse out of the earth: E∣uen so in this chapter, vnder the figure of the beast of the sea, whiche afterwarde is sayde to be a beaste of the lande, here are described vnto vs the chiefest of all the mortall enimies of Christes kingdom, namely the Heathenishnesse or super∣stition of the Roman Cesars, and the succéeding of Antichrist after it in Mahumet, and in the synagoges of the Iewes, and also the succeding of Antichrist in the Bishop of Rome. And wheras Antichryst is described vnder the figure of a beaste bothe of Sea and lande: it betokeneth that he shall be migh∣tie both by sea and lande, and shall extende his kingdom both into the mayne lande, and also into the Isles, and beare do∣minion far & wide. For he wil in all things be counted equal with Christ, of whom the prophet singeth thus: He shal beare dominiō from sea to sea, and from the riuer vnto the vtter∣most boundes of the land.Antichrist is not any one man, but a whole state. Psalm. 72. b. 8. Therfore it is too be noted, that as ofte as any mention is made of Antichrist, it must not bée restrayned vnto any one man, but rather bee extended too some whole kingdome, whyche settes it selfe against Christes kingdome. For there haue bene many An∣tichristes from the beginning, according as Iohn declareth 1. Iohn. 2. c. 18. namely euen as many as haue gone about to leade Christes Churche away from the purenesse and sin∣glenesse of Gods woorde, by their vntowarde and noysome errours. S. And worthily is Antichrist called a beast, by rea∣son
of his beastly lyfe and sauage maners. M. For he rageth lyke a mad beaste, and coulde fynde in his heart to haue all the godly rid out of the way at one instant. Hauing seuen heads and ten hornes. The dragon was shewed with as many heads & hornes heretofore in ye third verse of the last Chapter, to doo vs to vnderstand, that all one diuell worketh both in ye Dra∣gon and in the beast, & that the matter of the Dragon & of the beast is all one. And vpon his hornes ten Crownes. Heretofore in the third verse of the last chapter, Iohn had giuen but seuē Crownes to the Dragō wheras he had ten hornes, but héere he gyueth tenne Crownes too the ten hornes: for (accordyng as shall be sayd hereafter. 17. c. 13.) Ten kings,Al kings yeld vnto Anti∣christ. (that is to say all kings and Princes) shall giue their power vnto the beast, and shall haue all one will with the beast, namely to quenche the name of Christ: & so consequently the beast himself shal wrap vp or fulfill in himself the malice and naughtinesse of all the heads and hornes. Notwithstanding many of the olde doctors haue gathered vpō this place and vpon Daniels, that toward the end of the world, the Romane Empire shalbe di∣uided in ten partes, & that at the length there shal rise vp an∣other king yt shall ouercome those other ten kings. But those fathers toke their marke amisse. For it is manifest that the Empire is now diuided into manie mo parcels. Therfore the playner way is, too leaue the curious account of the number, and to take ten for many, after the custome of the scripture. Although then that the Romane Empire were diuided intoo sixe hundred partes: yet notwithstanding forasmuch as it is not vtterly ceassed, this beast is sayde too continue wyth hys heades, hornes,Crowned. and Crownes euen vntoo Christes comming againe. Howbeit, by the crownes are betokened the notable triumphes of victorie, whereof that forlorne wretch Anti∣chryst, shal glorie ageynst Christ and the godly for a time, as hath bin said heretofore, 12. a. 3. And vpon his heades a name of blasphemie. G. That is to say,The blasphe∣mous tites of Antichrist. he shall chalenge the power too himself, which belōgeth only vnto god. S. He shal haue titles yt
pretend the honor of a God, like as Nabugodonozor in Dan. 3. a. 5. as Alexander of Macedonie, Domitian, and certeine o∣ther Romane Emperors, and as Cosdras King of Persians, and many other tyrantes are reported to haue done: Who woulde néedes be called and proclaimed by the titles of Al∣wayes Augustus, Souereine Lordes of all men, most gracious and most mightie, and such other like, commaunding images of gold and siluer too bée made of themselues, and sacrifice to bée done vnto thē. Moreouer, of MahumetMahumet. this is manifest, that he hath aduaunced himselfe aboue Christ, in preferring his owne Alcorane before Christs Gospell.The diuelish∣nesse of yt Ro∣mane bishops And is any man able to number the blasphemous titles of the Bishop of Rome? for he will bée called most holy, and most blessed father, hyghest prelate or priest, Lord of the world, Christs Vicar, vniuersall Bishop, head of the Church, souerein iudge of all men, porter of heauen, the greater light, and such other like. G. Herewithal he commaundeth his owne diuelish traditions to be set foorth and kept in sted of Gods word: he holdeth mens consciences fettered with innumerable snares, as many as shun or with∣stand his doctrine as noysome, he punisheth thē with excom∣munication and cursing: A. and what is it which that wicked childe of perdition attempteth not, to reigne ouer the whole world by ouerwhelming, or rather by quenching the truthe quite out? But now his naughtinesse is méetly well discoue∣red, so as onlesse men will runne astray wilfully, they may easly auoyde the woodnesse of this raging beast. Which thing notwithstanding is giuen to none, but to those of whome the cheefe shepherd hath taken charge at his fathers hand. 2. And the Beast vvhich I savve, vvas like a Parde, & his feete vvere like the feete of a Beare, & his mouth like the mouth of a Lyon. And the Dragon gaue vnto him his strength, and his seate, and great povver. A liuely image of the Romish Antichrist.And the beast which I sawe was like a Parde. DO.S. In this one beast he seemeth to betoken all the whole naughtinesse which
Daniell hath described in all the foure that should take vpon them the monarchie of the world. For the Pard betokeneth incomparable swiftnesse in pursuing, the Beare vnmerci∣full crueltie, and the Lion vnuanquishable strength. And all these thyngs togither doth this one beast comprehende in himselfe, which is described to be bodied like a Pard, footed like a Beare, and mouthed like a Lion: according also as the fourth beast in Daniel is set foorth of diuers shapes and more terrible than the others: whereby is ment the Romaine Empire more dredfull than all the rest. Furthermore like as a Pard is speckled and particolored: so is Antichrist spotted with sundry and diuers heresies, and wauereth with euery wind of doctrine, hauing nothing certaine. For he is a Pard, bycause he saith he is Christs vicar vpon earth, although hée feyght against Christs law more than all others: and so is he a bastardship (though he tearme himselfe Apostolike béeyng indéede Apostatik) like as the Pard ingēdering with the Li∣on bringeth foorth the bastard Lion called a Libard. And hys feete were like the feete of a Beare. A. That is to say,Attichristā, bloudshedder and a seeker of earthly things. Antichrist shall be of the number of these, concerning whome it is said, Their féete be swift to shed blud. Rom. 2. c. 15. Also, their féete are running to do mischéefe. Prouerb. 1. b. 16. The Persians (who in Daniell are betokened by a Beare) are reported too haue bin very féerce and cruell: but yet far more cruel & out∣rageous wer ye Roman Emperors:  Antichrist who hath suc¦céeded those kings doth far surmount them all in outrageous feercenesse and crueltie. M. Furthermore although a Bare go vpon the earth with foure féete as other beas do, and yet his former féete do chéefly resemble the shape of a mans hāds. E∣uen so the Pope who ought to be formost of all other in spiri∣tual working, doth notwithstāding  whole indeuer to the vttermost; about ye heaping togither of earthly thyngs, more than al others, so as he hath  feete of his handes as the Beare doth, and vtterly despise the pouertie of the Gos∣pel. And his mouth as the mouth of a Lion: Antichrist is wor∣thily
likened to a Lyon, for the force of his bodie and the pride of his tung. G. In Daniel the Babylonians are compared t a Lyon, by reason of their incredible pride and rauenousnesse which are noted also by other of the Prophets and specially by Habucuk. 1. c. 8. & by Nahum. 2. d. 11. And no doubt but th Romanes haue passed them in that behalfe, considering how their purpose hath bin too subdue the whole worlde to them, accordyng as ye pryde of Antichrist beareth witnesse. B. Ther∣fore al these things, that is too wit, Pryde, Violence, Rauine, Deuouring, Cruelnesse, Inconstancie, defiling of the church, Suppressing of Gods lawes, Lecherie, vncleannesse, slaugh∣ter of mens soules, and all things that are appurtnances vntoo those poyntes, bée verefyed vpon the Romishe Anti∣chryst alone. M. Furthermore lyke as a Lyons mouth béeyng wyder than other beastes mouthes, is bloudie and ranke of sent with deuouryng of fleshe: Euen so there is nothing that can suffyse the Popes rauenousnesse: no not euen Peters patrimonie, nor Constantines gifte, nor yet all the Spiri∣tualties which he hathe intruded vpon, are in any wyse y∣nough for him, A. but that he dayly coyneth newe feates out of Satans forge, whereby too heape riches vpon ithes. M. Al∣so he hathe a Lyons mouth, whereby he vaunteth hymselfe too bée Lorde of the Citie and of the whole worlde. And yet Prester Iohn in the vpper and nether Indies: All Gréece and Arabie, and finally all the East Churche knoweth well ynoughe, yea and it is not vnknowen too vs also, that the Pope lyeth moste loudly in thys poynt. Nay rather thys su∣premacie is as muche despysed of them, as wée set lyght by the Lordlinesse of the great Cham, or of the Sould of Ba∣bylon.The greate aduauncemēt of ye Romishe Antichrist. And the Dragon gaue vntoo hym his strength. •.•. Anti∣christ is Christes Apo. For like as the auncient of dayes gau hys power and greate authoritie vnto Christ, Dani. 7. d. 14. So also dooth the Dragon too the Beast accordyng as shall bée sayde héereafter in the seuenth verse, that power was gi∣uen him ouer all kinreds and people. &c. And Paule sayeth,
whose comming is accordyng to the working of Satan, with all power and tookens, and lying wonders. 2. Thessa. 2. c. 9. Yea and Sathan himselfe boasteth of this power in Mat. 4. b. 9. and Luke. 4. a. 6. G. And this power is betokened by that whych Daniel wryteth, howe the Beast with the yron téeth deuoured and grynded intoo poudes, the thyngs that he had, and trampled the residu vnder hys féete. Daniel. 7. b. 7. S also after the Romanes were aduaunced too so great heigth by the working of Sathan: they despysed all other men, and trode all other Nations of the worlde vnder their féete. M. Yea and euen at this day, Antichrist estéemeth ye Gréekes and Arabians an Schismatikes, and déemeth them worthie too bée excommunicated, for standyng too the libertie of the Gospell, and for casting awaye from them the burthen of s horrible bondage. Vndoubtedly if we consider wel how poore and slender the first Popes were: wée shall easely sée, that s hurtfull an authoritie coulde not haue mounted oute of so greate pouertie and barenesse, but by the woorking of the Diuell. 3. And I savve one of his heades as it vvere slaine vn∣too death, and the vvound of his death vvas healed:Some reade: deadly wounded but his deadlye wound was hea∣led: & the whole earth wondring folowed the beast. and there vvas vvondering through the vvhole earth after the beast. And I sawe one of his heades. &c. •.•. He meaneth that the Romane Empyre shoulde bée cut asunder.The man∣gling of the Roman Em∣pire by Ma∣humet and the Pope. Whiche thing the stories reporte too haue bin done fyrst by Mahumet vn∣der the Emperour Heraclius, and afterwarde by the By∣shoppe of Rome: who by meane of the Kings of Fraunce procured hymselfe too bée quyte exempted from subiection too the Emperors of Rome. By whych déede the Romane Empyre is so decayed, that at thys daye there remayneth scarce the name and a certeyne lyttle thinne shadowe of it. Notwithstanding, some vnderstande this place too bée ment
of the wound that was giuen when the Serpents head w broken by Christes deathe,Satan woun¦ded by Chri∣stes death, & by the prea∣ching of his Gospell. at such time as the Gospell was preached through the whole worlde, maugre the Emperors which conspired against Christ, and at such time as the wor∣shipping of diuels was cast out of mens harts, yea and out of their Temples too. For no doubt but the beast receiued a deadly stripe at that time. But the wound thereof was hea∣led vp by Heretikes, by Mahumet, and by the Byshoppe of Rome, by whose meanes both the worshipping of Diuels, yea and all vngodlinesse tooke place in the whole worlde vn∣der the colour of religion more than euer it had doone before: and so the last part of the world became worse than the first. Othersome, by this heade, that was deadly wounded, vnder∣stande the deathe of Iulius Cesar,Iulius Ce∣sar. who was the firste that helde the soueraintie among the Romaines. For at that tyme the Romaine Empire whyche had begoon too growe greate afore, séemed almoste quenched. But that wounde was healed by Augustus,Augustus. who stablished that Monarce a∣geyne. The seconde Exposition séemeth to fitte the Texte beste. And there was woonderyng thoroughe the whole worlde after the beaste. S. For at this daye Mahumet possesseth two partes of the earthe, namely Asia and Aphrike, together wyth a good péece of Europe,How ye whole world won∣dreth at Anti∣christ. and continually buzieth hym∣selfe too heale the sayde wounde thoroughoute, that is too say, to bring the worlde into one Monarchie ageyne. The same thing doth the Bishop of Rome practise likewise: which thing hée vaunteth also as in respect of his style, namely that he is Lorde of the whole worlde. A. Héerevppon the whole earth wondereth at the beast. M. For suche as are earnestly mynded too the lawe of the Gospel,Protestants. do woonder at the Beast, that is too saye, at Antichryst, who calleth himselfe Aposto∣like aboue all others, where as they know that none is more Apostatike than hée. All the Easterne ChurcheThe Eastern Churches. woonde∣reth at the Beaste, and accomptethe the Christians that are subiecte to the Pope, too bée ouer beastly for assentyng
too his beastly conditions, whiche are so many and so many∣fest. All the heathen and IewesThe Heathen & the Iewes. woonder at the beast, among whome all suche as refuse Christ, doe thinke the doctrine of him too bée sonde and false, the chéefe professor whereof they see too bée more ageynst Chryst than all others.The Papists All such of the Chrysten sorte as are deceyued by Antichrist doo won∣der at hym, that any man dare set himselfe ageinst one that beareth the countenāce of so great a lord and so holy a father. And so forasmuch as their wondering at him is not in respect of Gospellike conuersation and doctrine, for they sée no suche thing in him) but for temporall cōmoditie, for fauor, for feare, & for cowardnesse: it is manifest that they haue forsakē God, and doo worship the diuell in the Pope. And this is it that is ment by that which is added forthwith. 4. And they vvorshipped the Dragon vvhiche had giuen power to the Beast: and they vvorshipped the Beaste, saying, vvho is like the Beaste? vvho is able to feight vvith him? And they worshipped the Dragon. S.The deuill is worshipped in Mahumet & in the Pope. Such as are falne from the Gospell of Christ to the lawe of Mahumet, doo worship the Dragon in Mahumet, whose will they doo from tyme too tyme. For what else is it to depart from Christes gouerne∣ment, but too yéeld a mans self to the subiection of Satan? ac∣cording too this saying of the Apostle, As for the things that the Gentyles offer in Sacrifyse, they offer them too Diuells, and not vnto God. 1. Cor. 10. e. 20. In likewise also, they that bée giuen ouer to the lawes and ceremonies of the Pope, and repose the hope of their saluation in him, worship the Dragō (that is to say the Diuel) in the Pope, as hath bin sayd afore. VVhich had giuen power to the Beast. M. This is added,The Pope is led by the spi∣rite of the de∣uill. bycause that whereas the Pope is a ranke traytour and a tirant, in wasting the goodes of the poore vppon himself and his, and in cutting mennes throtes for his owne pelting trashe, and wheras hée is soo greate an hipocryte, terming himself most
Apostolike of all others, and yet holding scorne of Apostolike conuersation: he hath not this of God, but of that most wylie Dragon who is not afrayde to call and drawe so manie and so great Heresies intoo the Churche. And they worshipped the Beast.The worship¦ping of Anti∣christ. M. q. d. Wretched and blind men worship, not onely the Diuell, but also his disciple Antichrist, which belketh out so manie blasphemies. S. I saye they worship the Beast, first by imbracing a Religion and seruice according too his appoynt∣ment: and secondly by woondering at his myghtinesse and by blazing it abrode. Which thing we sée indifferently as well in Mahumet, as in the Romishe Bishop: the shew of Religi∣on and incomparable puissance of both whō, the worlde both commendeth and honoreth vpon their knées. Saying, who is like the Beast? M. That is too saye, like Antichrist? S. In these wordes. Iohn giueth an incling of the blockishnesse of the world, for suffering it self to bée mocked through the prospe∣rous successe of the beast. B. For like as the godly do wonder at Christes power and commende it aboue all others, saying: Michael, that is to say, who is as God? So contrariwise these men say, Michabehemoth; that is to saye, who is as the Beast? or who is like the Beast? VVho is able to fight with the beast? namely in resisting his will, by reason of his dubble authori∣tie of supremacie, both Princely & Priestly, which he preten∣deth in ye Church militant: ye vse of both the which at once all other Princes go withoute, bée they neuer so high in degrée. S. Blind men therfore doo attribute such a souerein power vn∣to Antichrist,Who is so bolde as blind Bayarde. as no man is able to withstand, and such a po∣wer as abiding of it selfe inuincible, ouercommeth all other powers. And therfore the Pope suffereth the godly honours and godly titles of commendation too bée giuen vnto himselfe which are due only vnto Christ. Nay rather he exacteth them by vyolence and maine force, which thing no doubt will one daye turne too his confusion, according as we reade of Herod, Act. 12. d. 23.
5. And there vvas giuen vnto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies: and povver vvas giuen him to do tvvo and fortie monethes. And there was giuen. &c. A.A contrary comparing of the Pope and Christ togi∣ther. No man ought too maruel though he héere the Pope bothe too bée in déede, and also too bée openly reported too bée Antichrist: for he is vtterly and altogither contrarie vntoo Christ. G. For of our sauiour wée reade thus: He shall neither striue nor crie out, neyther shall anie man héere hys voyce in the stréetes: a brused réede shall he not breake. &c. Esai. 42. a. 3. and Math. 12. b. 19. Besydes this, he is méeld, méeke, and lowly of heart, Zachar. 9. b. 9. Math. 21. a. 5. But the Pope is proude, and puffed vp with prosperitie, and he speaketh great thyngs, specially in as much as he openly boasteth himselfe too bée Lord of the whole world. And blas∣phemies. S. Either of both the beastes preferreth himselfe and his owne law before our sauiour Christ and his Gospell, and promiseth souerein felicitie to such as kéepe it: and (according as it is written in Dani. 11. f. 36. & in Paule. 2. Thes. 2. b. 4.) he is aduaūced aboue al that is called or worshipped for God. &c. A. And should any man then thinke it straunge still that wée should call the Pope Antichrist, and so report him openly too bée? Who séeth not that he is vtterly contrarie too Christ. S. For Christ sought the honor of the father: but the Pope sée∣keth his owne honour. Christ most humbly serued all men, yea euen the vylest sort: but the Pope reigneth ouer al men, yea euen ouer the myghtyest Kings. Christ yéelded hymselfe willingly vntoo the vylest death that could bée for our sakes, the Pope putteth innumerable vntoo death, yea euen of the giltlesse sorte. B. Christ did not once open his lippes to speake ageynst the wrongfull iudge: but the Pope speaketh blas∣phemies ageynst God, and defyeth all Magistrates wyth∣oute regarde. The Pope vnhaloweth and defyeth Goddes Tabernacle. Chryst maketh it holy and cleane. The Pope makes warre ageynst the sainctes: Chryst reconcyleth euen
sinners to his father, and bringeth peace to the worlde. The Pope chalengeth power to iudge all men: Chryst would not iudge of a péece of grounde when he was sued vntoo. And af∣ter this manner a man may make comparisons of them tho∣rough all thyngs: whereby it wyll appeare more clearely than the light, that Antichryst is contrarie to Chryst in all thyngs,The vncerten¦tie, shortnesse, and cruelnesse of Antichrists reigne. accordyng too the signification of hys name. And po∣wer was gyuen hym too doo, two and fortie monethes. So many monethes make the halfe wéeke, whereby the scripture (for the comfort of the godly) dooth vs so often too vnderstand, that the tyme of Antichristes persecution shall bée shortened: which thing beginneth after the full and open falling away from the faith of Christ, at such time as Antichrist is discoue∣red in the hartes of men, who by the lighte of the Gospell be∣gin somewhat too leape backe from hys filthy Religion: for then shall he begyn too blaspheme and rayle vpon Christ and his Gospell with open mouth, and too worke his téene vpon the professors therof with open defyance. M. And lykewise the time of Antichryst is betokened by the thousande two hun∣dred and thréescore dayes mencioned héeretofore. 12. b. 6. And also by the tyme, and tymes, and halfe a tyme mencioned in Daniell. 7. g. 25. and héeretofore in .12. d. 14. B. But héere and in other places it is signifyed by these two and fortie monethes. Whereby is ment the vncerteyntie of hys persecution, in as muche as his gouernment is so diuersly descrybed, one while by dayes, another whyle by tymes, and other whyles by monethes: too the intent the faythfull should alwayes bée ar∣med wyth the swoorde of the Gospell too fyght ageynste hym. Neuerthelesse there bée that take these thyngs too bée ment,The presump¦teousnesse of Antichrist in altering of times and lawes. not of the tyme of Antichrystes persecuting, but of his pre∣sumptuousnesse, where throughe he shall take vpon him po∣wer too alter times and lawes, according to Daniels prophe∣sie: for thus saithe he. Also he shall speake wordes in the be∣halfe of the most hyghest, and he shall breake the faints of the most highest in péeces, & he shal think himself able alter tim
and lawes, and they shall be deliuered into his handes for a time, and times, and halfe a time. Dan. 7. g 25. Certaine it is that the Lord God onely is able to change times, not onely bycause winter Sommer and the other seasons of the yéere be ruled at his discretion: but also bycause all things be at his appointmēt, and the kingdomes of the world are not gouer∣ned otherwise than by his prouidence. A. If folke be well at ease, and ruled by good lawes, it must not be fathered vppon aught else than Gods prouidence. Contrariwise if they bée plaged, or by any meanes put in daunger, that also must bee acknowledged to procéede of Gods hande. But the pride of Antichrist is so great, that he thinks he may alter times and lawes, that is to say, ordeine all things at his owne will and pleasure. And in good sooth, is it not a point of extreme pride, to forbid the thing that the Lord hath graunted, or to peruert the law of wedlocke foreset by the Lord? The Pope forbid∣deth his subiects the eating of flesh at certain times: and Ma∣homet forbiddeth vtterly the eating of certaine beasts. The Pope hath decréed that certaine kinde of men and women should vtterly absteine from mariage: and Mahomet permit∣teth his subiects to haue many wiues. This man will haue no law admitted, saue that which is of his owne making: the other maketh his owne decrées equall or rather superior to the holy scriptures. And is not this as much as to alter times, lawes, and ordinances? The same thing is also attempted by the AnabaptistsAnabaptists. and suche other brainsycke persons, who thinke that the Church hath bin vtterly quenched euer since the time of the apostles: as who would say, that Christs king∣dome which is euerlasting, shuld haue cessed so soone. I grant indéede, that Christes flocke was now and then very small and knowen to feaw, as long as al things were wrapped vp in darknesse: but I denie that euer it was quite fordone, but that there were always some shéepe which harkned to Chri∣stes pure voice, and folowed him for their shepherd. Where∣fore as for those that hold opinion that all things must be vt∣terly
changed, and affirme that men must be baptized new againe: they méene to bring in, not right order, but horrible confusion of all things. 6. And he opened his mouth toSome reade blasphemie. rayling agaynst God, that hee myghte rayle vppon hys name, and vppon his tabernacle, and vppon them that dvvell in heauen. The error of Mahumet.And he opened his mouth to. &c. S. Mahumet folowing the heresie of Nestorius, denieth Christs Godhead, auouching him to be but bare man, howbeit yet a Prophet: in doyng whereof he also denyeth the father (1. Iohn. 2. d. 23.) and so cō∣sequently rayleth as well vpon the father as the sonne wyth open blasphemies, vtterly denying the singular goodnesse of God the father towardes vs, namely, that he deliuered hys owne sonne to death for our saluations sake: yea and also he maketh Christ a lyer, who hath auouched the same vnto vs with so many words, Iohn. 3. b. 36. and Luke. 24. f. 26. So al∣so maketh he the whole scripture as well of the olde Testa∣mente as of the newe, (yea and the holy Ghost which spea∣keth in it) to be a lier, which commendeth euery where this vnmeasurable goodnesse of God the father towardes vs, as in Esay. 53. a. 4. and Daniel. 9. f. 24. and Zachar. 13. c. 7. and Romain. 8. f. 32. & Phil. 2. a. 6.7.8. and 1. Iohn. 4. b. 10. Whiche things in asmuch as Mahumet denieth, it followeth of cōse∣quence that he denieth all ye Articles of the Christian beléefe: than the which blasphemie there can be no greater deuised. Also the Romish Antichrist offereth singular reproche too God,The blasphe∣mies of ye Ro∣mishe Anti∣christ. when he preferreth his own forgeries before Gods ho∣ly word, and kéeping men from the reading of the scipture, commaundeth them to hold themselues contented with hys owne diuelish decrées: M. and furthermore also when he deni∣eth that the Church can erre, and in sted of the holy word of the Gospell vrgeth innumerable such other kind of thynges
wherewith to wound mens soules, deadly, and to slea them maliciously. That he might rayle vpon his name. S. Antichriste denieth Christ to be the only mediator betwixt God & man, or the only Sauior to whome the father hath giuen all po∣wer in heauē and earth. He denieth him to haue made cléere satisfaction for our sinnes, and to haue reconciled vs through∣ly to God, by himselfe. Whiche to do, is as much as to offer most shamefull reproch and blasphemie to his name, and too haue him in disdain. And vpon his Tabernacle. That is to say,Antichrists rayling vpon the Churche of God. vpon the true Church of Christ. For the faithfull are Gods tabernacle, A. bycause God dwelleth in the congregation of the godly, and ruleth euery one of them with his spirit: lyke as it is written in the prophets: I will pitch my tent in the middes of you, and my hart shall not abhor you anye more. Leuit. 26. b. 11. And my Tent shall be among them, and I wil be their God. &c. Ezech. 37. g. 27. Also looke .1. Cor. 3. c. 16. & .6. d 19. & .2. Cor. 6.16. This Tabernacle, Tent, Pauiliō, or Tem∣ple of God is railed vpon by Antichrist, when he saithe that the congregation of the Godly is scismatike and hereticall: when he calleth the pure doctrine of Gods word, pestilent, which the faithful imbrace: and finally when he crieth out, that the Sacramentes whiche are ministred according to Christes institution, are filthy abhominations. And vppon them that dwell in heauen. S.How ye Pope rayleth vpon the Saincts deceased. That is to say vpon the sainctes deceased, which are conuersant with Christ in heauen. For if the Popes doctrine be taken for good: it followeth that Gods holy Prophetes and Apostles had a false opinion of God the father and of his sonne Iesu Christ, and left a false opinion of them to the world to beléeue. Than the whiche, what greater slaunder can be laid to their charge? And yet in the méene whyle, hée maketh stout bragges of the saincts deceased, in that he buildeth altars, Temples, and images to them, and assignes holydayes to them. &c. But these bée flat mockeries, considering that he so rashly despiseth and reiecteth the doctrine of those holye men of God, in
defence whereof they were not ashamed too spende theyr bloud. 7. And it vvas giuen vnto him to make vvare a∣gainst the Sainctes, and to ouercome them: and povver vvas giuen him ouer al kinreds, and people, and tungs, and nations. And it was giuen vnto him. &c. O. This may be referred to the victories whiche the Infidels haue oftentimes had of the Christians by the sufferance of God.The victories of the Turks and Infidels agaynst the Church. For histories make it manifest, how oftentimes the Turke hath fought luckely a∣gainst Gods Church in times past, and now a late almost in our time also: B. and yet by the way we will winke at hys victories which we haue séene in our age, whereby he hathe subdued to his dominion, all Thrace, and Constantinople it selfe, the palace of the Romaine Emperours, and alsoNow called Movon. Me∣tone and the Ile of Rhodes, & lastly the kingdome of Hunga∣rie,Why the faith¦full be called Saincts, that is to say, Ha∣lowes or holy folke. The victorie of the Pope agaynst the true Christi∣ans. sleaing the king of the Realme. Against the Saincts. A. So are the faithful tearmed, bicause they be redéemed by ye bloud of Christe, and being sanctifyed and borne a new by the holy Ghost, indeuer to leade a holy life. And to ouercome them. Here are described the cruell persecutions of Antichrist against the Church, which shall be so many and so greate, that there shall not séeme any Church to remaine. For when the wicked e∣nimies of the truth haue put Gods children to gréeuous tor∣ments, yea and also vnto death: they shall thinke in themsel∣ues, that they haue vanquished and vtterly ouercome them. But the cace standeth farre otherwise: for the godly are re∣warded with euerlasting immortalitie and endlesse life with Christ: by reason whereof they quietly despise all the assaults of their enimies, and whatsoeuer torment else can be layde vpon them, assuring themselues that they can by no meanes be disappointed of the loue of God whiche is in Christ Iesu.Antichrist hath mo frien∣ds thā Christ hath. Rom. 8. g. 39. And power was giuen him ouer all. &c. S. It is a putting of the particular for the generall, and must be refer∣red
eyther to the chéefer parts of the earth, or else vnto suche as sauor altogither of the earth. Truely among those that boast themselues of the name of Christians, Antichrist hathe mo fauorers and flatterers than stout withstanders. 8. And all the inhabiters of the earth shall vvorship him vvhose names are not written in the Lambs booke of life, vvho hath bin killed from the beginning of the vvorld. And all the Inhabiters. &c. A.Mo followe Antichrist thā Christ. Least any man might hang vp∣pon the opinion of the multitude: Iohn saithe expresly, that the greatest number of men shall giue their hand vnto Anti∣christ, according as Christe saithe, that the way is large and wide which leadeth to destruction, and many go in it. Math. 7. b. 13. VVhose names are not written in the Lambes booke of life.The elect can not be led a∣way by Anti∣christ. S. The names of the Apostles & of all beléeuers are writ∣ten in heauen: and the names of the wicked are written in the earth, according to this saying, they that depart from thee, shall be written in the earth Iere. 17. b. 13. That is to say, they shall be forgotten before God and before the congregation of the righteous. Which thing is expressed vnder another boro∣wed speeche, The vngodly are not so, but they be as chaffe which the wind tosseth about. Psal. 1. b. 4. A. The holy Ghost then exempteth the elect from being seduced and destroyed by Antichrist, bycause that looke whome God the father hathe giuen to his sonne Christe to kéepe, Satan cannot by anye meanes wrest them out of his hande, althoughe they séeme now and then to perish as the rest do. Therefore as for them that are not of the number of the chozen, whither they bée kings, or princes, or magistrates, or great or small, they are easly led away from the plaine truth by the deceites of Anti∣christ: and not without great wōdering they say, who is like the beast? verily he is strong and mightie in battell. S. Who is able to fight with the beast? But contrariwise the godly say: The Lord is strong and mighty, the Lord is mightie in
battell Psa. 24. c. 8.The fair shew of holinesse in the kingdome of Mahumet, and his great successe in all thyngs. We sée most euidētly, how al these things are fulfilled in the succession of Mahumet, if we marke well the beautifull shew of outward Ceremonies whych florisheth among them: and also if we consider the gouernance of theyr kingdome, their discipline of manners, their inuincible pu∣issance, their dayly successe in their affaires, and the conti∣nuall increace of their Empyre by often victories. Truly in outward pretence of religion, euen the common sort of their people excell the Popish Moonks, yea euen that are best re∣formed. For not onely their Clergie and Monkes, but also their commonaltie say their common prayers togyther fyue times euery day:Their dili∣gence and de∣uoutnesse in praying. namely at the sunne rising, at noone, at af∣ternoone, at the sunne setting, and after supper when they go to bed: at whiche time, ere they go to prayer, they wash themselues, they make themselues barefoote, they knéele downe vppon the grounde, and the noble men and com∣mons intermedling themselues altogither with the king, accomplish their ordinarie prayers wyth certaine bowings and fallings flat downe, without some lawfull let no man may neglect the ordinarie prayers,Their Holy∣dayes. Their exhor∣tatiōs to god∣lynesse. vnpunished. They kéep their ordinarie holydays and ordinarie fasting days with great deuotion and reuerence. They make often exhortati∣ons to holinesse of life to the peopleward, to dealing of doles, to making of pilgrimages in remembrance of their Saincts, and specially of their prophet Mahumet.Their Hos∣pitalles. They haue manye Hospitals as well in their high ways as in their Cities for the receiuing and succoring of poore folke and pilgrims. They haue Monks of such spare and staied behauior,Their monks as neuer was herd of, both in dyet, in apparell, in forsaking of al things, and in withdrawing themselues from the company of the com∣mō multitude: so as they may séeme to resemble, either Iohn Baptist yea or the very Apostles for the streightnesse of their life.Their visions traunces and miracles. Some of them haue visions, rauishments, and traunces: and some of them are renoumed for miracles, as well in their life, as after their death. Moreouer there is wonderfull
honestie of behauiour among them: In their fare, apparell,Their tempe∣rance. building, riding, yea and in their furniture of warre, they loue a plainenesse. When they take their meales, al of them, as well the king himselfe as also his noble men, sit downe vppon the ground, and they vtterly abstaine from wyne and swines flesh. They abhor all superfluitie and curiousnesse, as well in apparell as in building. For the most part, they dwell in Tents and hales which are remoued from place to place. In theyr leages, bargaines, and all promises,Their faith∣fulnesse. they vse great faythfulnesse. Héerevppon it commeth to passe, that they vse no seales to seale their writings withall, no not euen in the princes matters. Wonderfull is their loue and obedience towards their king,Their loue & obedience to∣ward theyr king. in somuch as all the noble men of the realme stoode in awe of the kings only commaunde∣mente, and in so many large kingdomes all thynges are done by the kings appointment only.Their wil∣lingnesse too battel for their religion and countrey. Those that be chozen to the warres for the defence of their religion, runne to it so merrie and chéerefull, that yee woulde say they were going to a wedding. They beléeue themselues to be happy in all poyntes when they yéelde vp theyr soules among the speares and arrowes in defending or inlarging their Empire or religion. Neyther are they that dye in that quarell com∣mended with the moorning of their fréendes, but they be re∣gistred among the Sainctes that haue gotten the vpper hande, and they be openly praysed wyth hymnes. Fy∣nally, greate is the shamefastnesse and honestie of theyr women.The honestie and shamfast∣nesse of theyr women. They bée neuer séene in the company of men or in places of resort. For a mā to talke with a womā abroade, it is so rare a thing, that it may be counted for a miracle if it happen to be séene. Their women neyther buy nor sell any thing. They neuer come in the fight of men with their faces bare, neyther in their owne houses nor out of their houses. The apparel that they weare,Their ap∣parell. is both very comely and very plaine. And in ye Church they haue a place alone by thēselues
from the men. Who then would not wonder at such behaui∣our and orderlinesse? who would not like of it? who coulde looke for such things euen at the hands of the popish monks, boast they neuer so much of reformation? Héereby they may easly deceiue such as are of an honest disposition, and make them beléeue that God fauoreth them highly, and aduanceth their empire. Take héerewithall their often victories,Their often victories. as wel against the Christians as also against the Nations bor∣dering about them, the successe of their affaires, and the long cōtinuance of their Empire. By all which things it commeth to passe, that it may séeme a holy Nation and déerelibeloued of God, and so consequently that he allureth all people to such manner of religion and behauior.The behauior of the Popish sorte. A. As for the superstitious Religion of the Papists, it is to no purpose to say any more of it, than that which is séene of all men: namely that if a mā looke vpon the continuall praying of the Cloysterfolke, theyr gorgeous churches, their ordinarie holydays and solemne feasts, their appointed fasts, and such other things: it carieth a great countenance of holinesse. By meanes whereof many are hild backe in these dais from beléeuing of the Gospel. But the cace standeth well, in that Christ hath his chozen, whiche being sealed with the spirit of adoption; do héere and follow no mans voyce but Christs. These are they which being cho∣zen and predestinate before the foundations of the worlde were laid, are giuen to Christ by God the father, and are cō∣teined written in the booke of life, according to this saying of Christe, Reioice ye in this that your names be written in heauen.Wherin mans saluation con∣sisteth. Luke. 10. d. 20. G. And by this place we learne, that mans saluation consisteth not in welth or in riches or in any outward worthinesse, but in the only and frée electiō of God. C. For the foundation and first cause, as well of our calling; as of all ye good things that we receiue at Gods hand, is Gods eternall election. G. Therefore if any man demaund, why god hath called vs to the partaking of his Gospell, why hée hathe vouaued so great benefites vpon vs, why he openeth vntoo
vs, A. why he allureth vs by gentlenesse too his heauēly king∣dome, and why he alwayes preserueth & mainteyneth vs: C. we must always haue recourse to ye said principle, namely bicause he choze vs before ye world was made. A. So thē here∣by al mans merit or deseruing falleth to the ground & is shet out of dores, in as much as it is most manifestly certeine,Mannes de∣seruing. that election is free. C. For what worthinesse could there be on our part, or what could we deserue, before the world was made? E. Also we learne hereby, yt our electiō is certein,Our election is certaine. which could not be so, if it were grounded vpō our owne workes or deser∣uings. In likewise neither our predestinatiō, nor our iustifica∣tion, nor our redemptiō, should be certeine, if ye cause of those things were in our selues. For seing ye works are always ac∣companied with doubting: they that ground the beginning of their saluation vpon them, can neuer bée certified in theyr mindes. A. God then without hauing any respect vnto works,The causes of our election. hathe chosen vs before the beginning of the worlde, E of his owne frée grace, mercie, loue, good liking, will, purpose and foreordinance, as causes thereof. C. And this doth Paule testifye in expresse wordes where he speaketh of Iacob and Esau, saying: before they were borne or had done eyther good or euill, (too the intent that Gods purpose myght stande fast according to hys choozing,) not of workes but of the caller, it was sayde, the Elder shall serue the yonger. Roma. 9. c. 11.12. and Gene. 25. e. 25. A. Then dyd not God chooze vs for anye worthynesse that he foresaw in vs, (as the Sophisters prate) but onely of hys owne frée wyll and good pleasure. C. For wee bée all forlorne in Adam, and there is nothing too bée séene in vs but matter of Damnation. And therefore excepte God redéeme vs from destruction by hys owne choozing of vs, he shall sée nothing else why too lyke of vs. Also looke in the fifth verse of the third Chapter héeretofore, and in the .xij. verse of the twentith chapter héereafter: VVhich hath bin slain. &c. B. He meaneth Christ who was betrayed for our sinnes, and rose ageine for our iustification. Roma. 4. d. 25. From the be∣ginning
of the world. There be which thinke that this parcell should bée ioyned with the parcell, which are not written, to the same effecte that Christ spake of the dwelling places that are prepared in his fathers house, Math. 20. c. 23. and Iohn. 14. a. 2. So in another place he saith, Come yée blissed of my father, possesse yee the kingdome which is prepared for you from the begynning of the worlde, Math. 25. c. 34. G. And Paule sayth, He chose vs in Christe before the foundations of the worlde were layd, Ephe. 1. a. 4. But the playner is too haue it ioyned with the parcell next afore it,The assured∣nesse of our e∣lection & pre∣dest nation. which is: which hath bin slaine, so as the meaning may bée, that the Lamb hath béene kylled from the beginning of the world. Wherby Iohn doth vs too vnderstand, that from the first creation of the world (not for their own desertes, but for the desert of the Lamb who in the foreappointment & good pleasure of the father hath bin slain euen from thenceforth in the sacrifices of the godly as it were in a figure) the names of the elect are inrolled and written in Heauen, and could not bée razed out by anye force of Satan, nor by any deceite or crueltie of Antichryst. In respect wher∣of Chryst also saythe, Before Abraham was, I am, Iohn. 8. g. 58. Also, Iesus Chryst is all one, yesterday, and too day, and for euermore. Hebrew. 13 v. 8. Also looke in Actes. 15. c. 15.16.17.18. And in the fifthe verse of the thirde Chapter héereto∣fore. 9. If any man haue an eare, let him heere. 10. He that leadeth into captiuitie goeth intoo cap∣tiuitie: He that kylleth vvith the svvord, must bee kil∣led vvith the svvord. Heere is the patience and faith of the Sainctes. If anye man haue an eare, let him heere. S. He sheweth that there is a mysterie in the matter: and therefore as ofte as thys parcell is added in the Scriptures, the holye Ghost stir∣reth vp the heerers mynde too searche oute the hyghnesse of
the mysterie: accordyng also as our Sauiour is woont too doo in the Gospell, Math. 13. a. 9. He that leadeth intoo captiuitie.Looke with what measure ye meete with the same shall it be moten vn¦to you. S. This is sayd for the comfort of the godly, too the ende they may know, that they shall be delyuered from captiuitie, and contrariwyse that such as hild them captiue, shall bée caryed intoo captiuitie: according too this texte, He led captiuitie cap∣tiue. Psal. 68. c. 19. and Ephe. 4. b. 8. A. Wherwithall agréeth this saying of the prophet: Wo vntoo thée that spoylest and hast not been spoyled, whiche dooest wrong and hast had no wrong doone vntoo thée. For when thou hast done spoyling, thou shalt be spoyled thy selfe, & when thou hast made an end of dooyng wrong, thou shalte haue wrong doone vntoo thée. Esai. 33. a. 1. Also, Beholde the Lorde commeth with hys thousandes of Sainctes too doo iudgement vpon all men, and too reproue all suche as are wicked, of all the deedes whiche they haue wrought wickedly, and of al the harde things that the wicked sinners haue spoken ageinst him, Iude. c. 14.15. Also, it belongeth vnto Gods righteousnesse, to render afflic∣tion vnto suche as afflict you, and vntoo you that are afflicted, reléefe. &c. 2. Thessa. 1. b. 6. Most foolishe then are they, and far from vnderstandyng the minde of the holy Ghost, which im∣pute the Turkes successe and victories too hys Religion and iust dealing, and not rather too their owne sinnes. For they are lyke those that fathered all the prosperitie of the heathen vpon the seruyng of theyr Idolls, and contrarywyse theyr owne myserie vppon the neglecting of theyr Idoll seruice, as it is wrytten in Ieremie. 44. d. 18. M. Therefore suche as leade men captyue from the faythe and doctryne of the Gospell, (as Antichryste nowe doothe) shall bée ledde in∣too Captiuitie of endlesse damnation, excepte they repent. Hee that kylleth wyth the swoorde muste bee kylled wyth the swoorde. S. Wée reade that Christe sayde vntoo Peter,The meanes how to inlarge Christes king¦dome, & wher∣by his people be knowne. put vp thy sworde intoo the scaberd, for euerye one that stry∣keth with the sword shal perish with the sword. Mat. 26. e. 52. For Christendome is inlarged by the word and by working,
that is too say, by the preaching of the truth, and by myracles and wonders. 2. Cor. 10. a. 4.5. B. Contrariwise, Antichrist cō∣pelleth al mē to his Religion by the sword. Also, Gods childrē are knowē by louingnesse, peace, and all maner of good doing. Math. 5. a. 9. and Iohn. 13. d. 35. &. 15. b. 12. But contrariwyse, the Diuells impes are knowen by hating and murthering one another, Iohn. 8. f. 44. &. 1. Iohn. 13. b. 12. vnexcusable ther∣fore are they, whosoeuer they bée, which worship that cruell and bloudie beast. Moreouer, too no purpose also are the dea∣lings of them, that go aboute too defende the Gospell by the sword, whither it bée ageinst the Turk or ageinst Antichrist, when in the meane whyle they neglect true godlinesse.The meanes to vanqu she Antichryst. And in this place all the godly are warned too haue patience, least they myght thinke that Antichrist may bée put too flighte by their owne power or policie. For this victorie belongeth to none but onely to the Lambe Christ. He onely will triumph ouer that so puissant enemie: yea and that shall be done euen then chiefely, when the enemie thinketh all things too be safe so as the godly dare not once open theyr lippes ageynst hym, but onely make earnest sute too the Lorde wyth continuall fasting, wéepyng, and praying, that he wyll helpe them and breake the enemie in péeces. For as long as wee trust too the arme of fleshe, wee are vnworthie of Gods helpe: whiche thing is too bée séene, in that auncient people of God, as ofte as they put their trust in their owne strength, and not in the Lorde, A who notwithstanding had sayde, In rest and quietnesse shall you bée safe, in calmenesse and trust shall bée your strength. Esai. 30. c. 15. Heere is the pacience and fayth of the Saincts.The victorie of the faithful by patience. The Romish Antichrist claymeth both ye swords, as well temporal as spirituall, accordyng as in déede he slea∣eth both bodyes and soules, but yet the faythfull being armed wyth faith and patience, beare out all manner of assaultes of their enemies, and also shift them off, according as Chryste sayth, Possesse ye your soules in patience. Luke 21. d. 19. A. Al∣so Iohn saith, Al that is borne of God ouercōmeth the world.
And the victorie that ouercommeth the worlde is this, euen your faith. 1. Iohn. 5. a. 4. Also, you must haue patience (sayth the Apostle) that when ye haue fulfilled the will of God, yée may reape the promise. Hebr. 10. g. 36. 11. And I savve another beast comming vp oute of the earth, and he had tvvo hornes like the Lambes, and he spake as the Dragon did. And I sawe another beast. &c.Mainteiners of diuelishe doctrines. O. Like as the former Beast which came vp oute of the sea hauing ten hornes, betokened all kingdomes, States, & Monarchies which go about to sta∣blish sundry kinds of vntruthes & diuelishe doctrines by vio∣lence and force of hand: So this beast comming vp out of the earth, betokeneth such as labour too mainteine the same diue∣lish doctrines by ouerthwart interpretations, forged Ceremo∣nies, and counterfeit Religion. A. Of which sort there be ma∣nie at this day vnder the kingdome of the Pope, as Monkes, Sophisters, schoole diuines, workers of false miracles, & such others. Therefore eyther of both these beastes doth alwayes portray vntoo vs Antichrist, howbeit in such wise as that the saide childe of perdition is peinted out in sundrie colours. And he had two hornes like the Lambes.The Popes counterfaite holinesse and pride in taking vpon hym both princely and priestly power. S. This beast pretendeth the hornes of the Lamb, to the intent he may priuily shead in the poyson of the Dragon. And therefore Christ warneth vs too beware of false prophets which come vnto vs in shéepes clo∣thing. Math. 7. b. 15. But vnto whō may a man attribute these things rightlier than to the Pope? B. for he pretendeth a great countenance, as well of innocencie, as of perfectnesse of lyfe. M And in the two Testamentes, he boasteth himselfe too bée péerlesse. Now then, for as muche as Princely power is be∣tokened by hornes: by the two hornes like the Lambes, may be ment both the priestly and Princely power which ye Pope taketh vpō him. And he saith they be like ye Lambes hornes: for the Pope vaunteth himselfe too be Christes Vicar, when as he both executeth and decreeth all things by his owne au∣thoritie.
He pretendeth Christs Gospell, but he applyeth it too his owne aduauntage. He baptizeth with water in the name of the father and of the sonne & of the holy Ghost: but as for the power of making men new agein, (which is the peculiar worke of Christes Spirit,) that he attributeth vnto his owne doing. Furthermore he chalengeth dominion ouer those whō he baptizeth in the name of Christ. So also (after a sorte) he refresheth with bread in the Lordes Supper: but he impu∣teth the vertue of it too the magicall consecration and worke of the Priest. And so likewise he imputeth the releasing of Sinnes too his owne absolution, wherin he glorieth that the power of the kyes consisteth. Therefore he hath hornes lyke the Lambe, but he speaketh as the Dragon doth: that is too wit, he defaceth Gods glorie, and thrusteth Christ quite out of dores,The blasphe∣mous speches of the Pope, & his outrge∣ous defacing of Christes ordinaunces & institutions. as followeth. And he spake as the Dragon. A Lyke as the chyldren of God are so led by Christes spirit, and as they speake vntoo others the things that the same spirite putteth intoo their myndes. Euen so the vngodly béeyng driuen by the spirite of Satan, cannot vtter any thing but errours and blasphemies. This beast whych Iohn descrybeth vntoo vs in this place, hathe two hornes like the Lambes. For he shroudeth all his doyngs vnder colour of the profession of the Gospell, and maketh countenance as though he followed the Lambe that was slaine for vs. But if a man héere and consi∣der his voyce somewhat aduisedly, he shall finde it too bée no∣thing lesse than the Lambes voyce. Whiche thing Daniell hath excellently foretolde. B. He shall (sayth he) speake words at the syde of the most hyghest. Daniel. 7.25. A. and he shall speake wonderfull things ageynst the God of Gods. Dan. 11. f. 36. And in the little horne wée reade thus: it had a mouthe speaking bigge things. Daniel. 7. f. 20. Is it not a Dragonly voyce, when the Pope makes his bragges, that he is of as much power as Christ: that he is the foundation, heade, and husband of the Church: that he alone hath ryght to interpret the scriptures and to determine all questions of faith: that he
is Lord of the whole world, & hath the right of all Realmes remaining in him: that he is the high priest & chiefe ruler of all Churches: that he hath authoritie to iudge all men, & can be iudged of no man: that he hath all lawes in his brest, and by the fulnesse of his power may either alter them or take thē quite away and make newe in their stead: that he is able by the power of his kyes too lift soules out of hell vntoo purgato∣rie, and from thence vntoo Heauen, and finally too make sin of vertue, and vertue ageine of sinne? whiche thing will bée manifest if yée consider how the Pope maketh the ministring and receyuing of the communion vnder both kindes (whiche beeyng of Christes institution, was reuerently and stedfastly obserued by the Apostles and fathers of the primitiue Church for certeine hundred yeares togither) too bée an heresie, yea and suche an heresie, that for the wéeding of it out, Eugenie ye fourth Bishop of Rome of that name, did put all the Romane Empire in armes, in the time of the Emperour Sigismund, when he cried a croyssie (as they terme it) ageynst the Bohe∣mians for the same qarrell. Moreouer he maketh the mari∣age of the Clergie too bee a heynous sinne, and worthie to bee punished wyth death. For euen in this our time many of the Clergie haue by his ordinance béene eyther strangled wyth a halter, or otherwyse cruelly put too deathe for marying. Besydes this, he maketh the bying of Alom at anye other mannes hande but hys owne, too bée suche a sinne, that it cannot bée washed awaye, no not euen wyth full pardons as they terme them: in so muche as the wickeddest cut throte in the worlde, maye easelyer get pardon, than suche a one. But contrariwyse, too vse whoredome and Baude∣rie and other filthyer thyngs, whych I let slip by the way, so farre of is he from counting them anye heynous offence, that he rather inhonoureth suche as bée of that stampe, wyth more than ordinarye estimation and rewardes. Too bée shorte, is anye man able too number the blasphe∣mous and Diuelyshe speeches which are dayly herde at the
mouthes of the Pope & his flatterers? A. But such trées maye easly be knowen by their fruites, if we vew euery thing tho∣roughly with the eyes of faith. 12. And he executeth all the povver of the former beast in his presence, and he maketh the earth and the dvvellers therin to vvorship the first beast vvhose dead∣ly vvound vvas healed. The excessiue pride & pompe of the Romish Antichrist and his adherents ageinst lawful Magistrates.And he executeth all. &c. G. Vnder the name of this latter beast, some (not vnfitly) vnderstand Antichristes Ministers and flatterers, through whose policie, Counsell, and perswa∣sion it comes to passe, that the beast (that is too say Antichrist) is worshipped, whose tyrannie they shamelesly defend, com∣pelling men too admit, yea and also to kéepe his ordinances and traditions in sted of the Gospell. Howbeit this place she∣weth plainely ynough, that the Antichristes doo shamelesly vsurpe the power and authoritie of Kings and Princes, carelesly despysing the souereine authoritie wherevntoo all men ought too bée subiect, and aduauncing themselues aboue all men. Which thing to bée done still at this day, it is as eui∣dent as the lyghte. S. For truely the Bishop of Rome mat∣cheth the royall power, (that is too say the warlike force) the excesse, the pryde, and the crueltie, both of the Romane Em∣perours, and also of the Turkes. And this dooth he in the pre∣sence of the former beast, that is to wit, of hym that is the lawfull successor in the Empyre of Rome, who is fayne to fall downe at the Byshop of Romes féete, and too kysse them and too worship him: at whose appoyntment he is cho∣zen, too bée deposed and put from his Kingdome when he listeth: lyke as Gregorie the seuenth deposed the Empe∣rour Henrie the fourthe:Gregorie the seuenth depo∣peth the Em∣terour Henry the fourth. so as the Emperoure of Rome is in these dayes nothyng else but the Byshops féede man, ha∣uing but a vayne tytle at his hande, and nothyng else be∣sides: in whose presence the Bishop triumpheth like Iulius Cesar, boasting himselfe to be Lord of the world, and that the
authoritie of both the swords belongeth vnto him by commis∣sion from Christe. And therefore it is to be taken in way of skorn, that Iohn saith, In his presence. q. d. Whatsoeuer things belong to the ordinarie power of worldly princes, that doth this tyrant execute in the very presence of them, euen in de∣spite of them, like as it is at this day. Which thing the Apo∣stle Iude hath foretold in these wordes, They despyse rulers and speake euill of them that be in authoritie, Iude. b. 8. And he maketh the earth and the &c.Al heathenish idolatry brou∣ght in agayne by the Popes. That is to say he bringeth in againe the old heathenish Idolatrie vsed vnder the wicked Emperours. For what else doth the world reuerence & wor∣ship in that Idol of Rome, than the same thing which Idola∣trous antiquitie worshipped in old time in the wicked kings: that is to wit, his great force of armes, and his inuincible po∣wer whereof he glorieth?The olde ido∣latrous em∣pire of the first Emperour is reuiued in the Popes. Seing then that he maketh himself the only soueraigne of the world, seing he vaunteth himselfe to be Christes vicar, seing he will be worshipped of all men, seing he calleth the very Emperour of Rome and the chéefest princes of Christendome to the kissing of his féete, (vnto the which they knéele downe with trembling and reuerence) see∣ing he makes himselfe to be caried aloft vpon noble mens shoulders garded roūd about him on either side with a great rout of chozen personages, seing he appointeth lawes vnto all men, seing all men must séeke iustice at his hand, seing he ordeineth kings and deposeth them againe when he listeth, seing he setteth thē continually at variance among themsel∣ues to make slaughter one vpon another, séeing he exacteth the tenths of tithes out of their Realmes: what cā be thought else, but that the former beast, (that is to say the monarchie of the Romane Empyre) is receiued againe in him, and wor∣shipped in him? G. And yet for all this the mynds of princes haue bin possessed with so great blindnesse, that they scarce perceiued or vnderstoode that thing which in these days ap∣péereth to be knowen euen of Childrē. VVhose deadly wound was healed. Looke vpon the third verse of this Chapter.
13. And he vvorketh great miracles, in somuch as he maketh euen fire to come dovvne from heauen vppon the earth in the sight of men. The false mi∣racles of An∣tichrist & his adherents.And he worketh. &c. G. This is the same thing whereof Christe hathe giuen vs warning, saying: There shall rise vp false Christs and false Prophets, and shall shew great mira∣cles and wonders, in somuch as euen the very elect shall bee led into error, if it were possible. Math. 24. b. 24. Also Paule writeth of Antichrist in this wise: whose comming is accor∣ding to the working of Satan, with all power and miracles and lying wonders, and with all deceit of vnrighteousnesse in them that perish.Popish Pr∣dons and Ex∣communicati∣ons. 2. Thess. 2. c. 9. Insomuch as he maketh euen fire to. &c. M. Like as the holy Ghost was giuen to Christes holy Apostles in the likenesse of fire: so these false Apostles and Antichrists blaze abroade their popish pardons, whych they auouch to proceede frō the holy Ghost, but in very déede proceede from the malicious féend, in asmuch as they be gy∣uen to the intent to gather mony for the maintenance of An∣tichrists armie, that the préests might leaue the holinesse of their state, and fall to killing of the faithfull. Also this com∣ming downe of fire seemeth to betoken the thundering ex∣communications and cursings, wherewith the Bishop of Rome scareth the whole world. S. Whereof there is shewed a notable proofe as often as his chaplaines thunder agaynste some great prince with their burning tapers. For there a mā might see all things full of fire, and all things resembling the terriblenesse of lightnings, and representing fyrie showers sent downe from heauen, as was in olde time vpon the So∣domites.Se how they blere the eyes of ye ignorant. In the sight of men. That is to say openly and when the people were assembled togither: to the intent he myghte strike others in feare by such gastly sights, while such as are light of credit, beléeue that those are tormented with fire from heauen, against whome such manner of thundering is vsed. In such a gaze certaine of Gods seruants seemed alate
to haue bin burnt vp with such maner of fyring, wheras they of all that time either wrate, or preached, or did something else against the said Bishop, and feared nothing lesse thā such emptie cracks. For they knew it to be most true which our sauioure said to his disciples: Blissed shall you be when men hate you, and put you out of their companie, and raile vppon you, and cast out your name as an euill thing, for the sonne of mans sake. Reioice and be glad in that day, &c. Luke. 6 d. 22. S. Moreouer Iohn hath alledged the miracle of fire, as a dred∣fuller miracle than the rest, perchance of purpose to allude to the destruction of the Sodomites, Gen. 19. e. 24: or else too the miracle of the fire that came downe from heauen at the bid∣ding of Elias, and burnt vp the two bandes of fiftie men a∣péere. 4. Kings. 1. b. 10.The Popes haue the holy Ghost as Si∣mon Magus had it. Except any man like better that hee meant to haue had respecte to the miracle of the fire in the likenesse whereof Christ sent the holy Ghost vnto his disci∣ples. Act. 2. a. 3. Which holy Ghost the romish Antichrist pro∣miseth also to his owne oyled chapleines. In respect whereof they make their bragges, that they are able to prepare men or to make them meete for the receiuing of Gods grace, too enlighten their minds, yea and also to deale the holy Ghost vnto whome they list. 14. And he deceiueth them that dvvell vppon the earth by meanes of those miracles vvhich he hath po∣vver to do in the presence of the beast, saying to them that dvvell vpon the earth, that they should make an I∣mage vnto the beast which hath the wound of a sword, and did liue. And he deceiueth them. &c.Antichrystes false miracles and wh be deceiued by them. M. For asmuch as no men are thought to be of greater holinesse in life, or of greater sound∣nesse in doctrine, than the Popes hypocriticall soothers, and specially than those which vnder pretence of Religion séeme to leade a certaine angelicall life: it is no maruell thoughe they leade manye oute of the waye by preaching in
Antichrists behalfe, and by furthering his affayres, A. special∣ly if they light vpon any thing which they may bring men in beléefe to be a miracle. S. For who knoweth not of the innu∣merable miracles that haue bin forged and blowen abroade heeretofore in open pulpit by the Cloyster men and Questio∣naries as they tearme them: which they beare men in hand to haue happened at the tumbes of suche as haue bin cano∣nized for Sanctes by the Pope, and also at the Images of saincts, and at the touching of dead mens bones? Also who knoweth not the feyned reuelations of the votarie Fréeres and Nunnes? Neyther ought any man to thinke it straunge, that miracles should be wrought by the practise of wicked feends to beguile the héedlesse, and to trie the elect. For wée reade that Pharaoes wizards did the like things that Mo∣ses and Aaron did: Exod. 7. b. 11. and also that the like is fore∣warned in Deuteronomie. 13. a. 2. and likewise what happe∣ned to blissed Iob by the working of Satan, Iob. 1. b. 11. A. In which respect Paule speaking of the false miracles of Anti∣christ, affirmeth that none shal be deceiued by them, but only the reprobates. B. And therefore, God (saith he) shall send them strong illusions, so as they shall beleue lyes, to the intent that all may be damned which haue not beléeued ye truth but haue allowed vnrightuousnesse.The negli∣gence of prin∣ces and magi∣strates. 2. Thessa. 2. c. 11.12. In the presence of the beast, S. that is to say of the romish Antichrist, who shall knowe, sée, and allow such manner of miracles, as wrought by God, whither they be done at the sute of dead folke or at the prayers of Monks & Nunnes: and such manner of trum∣perie shall be winked at by princes & rulers of comō weales, whose duetie it had bin to prohibite suche deceites,The Romish Antichrist sur¦mounteth all idolaters as well old as newe. that their simple commons myghte not haue fled from the defense of Christ, to seeke succoure at Diuels. For what else are suche wonders, but Satans owne working and handicraft? accor∣ding as the Apostle saith. 2. Thessa. 2. c. 9. Saying to them that dwell vpon the earth &c. In these words héere is fault founde with the presumpteousnesse of the Romishe Antichriste for
passing into so great wickednesse, that he not only fully mat∣cheth, but also in all respects surmounteth the cheefe Idola∣ters, as well old as new: in whome is reuiued all the hipocri∣sie and filthinesse of diuelish superstition, and all the abhomi∣nable wickednesse whiche seemed to haue bin vtterly quen∣ched at such time as the Emperoures had professed themsel∣ues Christians. Truly, whatsoeuer wickednesse the stories of the Byble report to haue bin done at any time by Idola∣trous kings and people through the whole world about I∣dols and Images: that hath the Romish Antichrist brought backe againe in himselfe, according as I haue shewed alrea∣dy héeretofore. 15. And he had povver to giue a spirit to the Image of the beast, that the Image of the beast might speak al∣so, and to cause that as manie as vvould not vvorship the Image of the beast, should be slayne. And he had power to giue &c. A. G To giue a spirit to the I∣mage of the beast, is to defend and mainteine his authoritie, supremacie, & tyrannie: which thing we see done by many in these dais, who shamelesly defend the Popes horrible abuses against ye holy scripture.Popes Ne∣cromancers or allyed with Necroman∣cers. That the image of the beast may speake also, Certaine it is, that in the kingdome of Antichrist many things are done by Satans workmanship, which rauish the simple and ignorant sort, and set them in a maze with won∣dering S Besides this, it is recorded in stories, that manie of the Romish bishops were nigromancers: among whome A∣nastasius was one. Cardinall Benno in his booke of the lyfe and doings of Hildebrand, writeth that many obteined the Popedome by diuelish arts. Among whome he reckeneth vp Siluester the second, Iohn the eyghtéenth, Iohn the nyne∣téenth, Iohn ye twentith, Benet the eyghth, Benet the ninth, and Gregory the seuenth erst called Hildebrand the notable nigromancer, who with the shaking of his sléeues woulde make as it were sparks of fire to flye abroade as often as he
listed. Also Boniface the seuenth and Boniface the eighth (as others haue reported in their writings) atteined to ye Pope∣dome by euill arts.A woman Pope. Moreouer by what cunning may a man thinke the womanpope to haue atteined to the high préest∣hood? To be short, for this certaine hundred yéeres last past, there haue bin few Popes which haue not either bin Nigro∣mancers themselues, or had néere about them such as were giuen to that art. And what manner of monstrous miracles thinke ye that such bishops were able to forge? No mā there∣fore must thinke it straunge, that suche as are steyned wyth this art can dazle mens eyes with diuers slights. For wée know how great wonders Pharaos wizards wrought in E∣gypt,Images haue both spoken & wept. Exod. 7. b. 11. But how soeuer these matters go: yet is there no man but he knoweth, that images haue both spokē and wept, and swet bloud, and shewed angrie lookes, or tur∣ned away their heads, and remoued out of their places, and giuen milke out of their brests: and finally what could they not do as long as it was lawfull to feyne these things, and to set them foorth to the people for articles of their faith, by the Popes allowance? And at length the world was come to that point, that if any being wise and skilfull in spying out suche inconuenience, beléeued not their false miracles, they were counted scarce godly, or rather ranke heretikes. It was almost come to passe, that the slight whiche the Fréers of Dominikes order had deuised in BernaBerna. among the Swis∣sers (whiche was that the Image of the blissed virgin Mary should séeme to speake and to wéepe,) should haue bin taken for a true miracle, had not the watchfull magistrate set in his foote by wise policie in time. And to cause that as many. &c. This is it that we said already,It is heresie to speake a∣gainst the Po¦pes trūperies, the which he minteneth by the sword. namely: that who soeuer gy∣ueth not credite to suche manner of trumperies, or who so∣euer speaketh against them, he must be counted the rankest heretike that can bée, and worthy to dye a thousand deathes. Also we see how both the Antichrists, as well he of the East, as he of the West, mainteyne their Religion by the sword,
and cruelly put to deathe as many as subscribe not to their wickednesse. And no maruell, for sith that none of them both is able to warrant his decrees by record of scripture, they haue thought it good to mainteine them by the temporall sworde, least mens myndes myght by little and little be withdrawen from them, and imbrace the pure doctrine of Christ. 16. And hee maketh all men, small and great, riche and poore, free and bond, to receiue a marke in theyr right hand, or in their forheads. And he maketh all men. &c.Antichrystes great power & dominion. S. By these wordes is betokened againe the beasts great power matched with shamelesnesse, which reigneth euen ouer the great ones, frée ones, and riche ones, that is to say, ouer the cheefest kings and potestates, as well as ouer the small ones, that is to saye, as well as ouer the poorer sort, the common sort and bond sort: and oppresseth them with wrongfull lawes. To receiue a marke in their right hand.Antichrist is Christs Ape. Like as those whome Christ hath taken of his father to kéepe, are signed and marked by him with the inwarde marke and seale of the holy Ghost, who writeth the law in the bowels of their harts, Ierem 31. f. 33. in somuch as béeing waged with that earnest peny, they dare crie Abba father. Roma. 8. c. 15. & Gala. 4. a. 6: and also like as he decketh them with louingnesse and good doing towards their neighbors, that by that marke they may be knowen vnto all men to be his true Disciples. Iohn. 13. d. 35. Euen so Antichrist béeing Christes Ape, the man of sinne, and the child of perdition, indeuering to resemble him in a certaine outwarde appée∣rance, bycause he cannot do them truly and in very deede, doth all thynges counterfetly. Therefore whom he infranchizeth into his kingdome, he maketh them to receiue a marke in their right hand and in their forheads. Moreouer ye word All men, which is the marke of vniuersalitie, cōprehēdeth in this place but only all such as haue not their names writtē in the
Lambs booke of life. A. For the chozen, whose welfare is com∣mitted vnto Christ, are not subiect to the deceites of Satan or of Antichrist: according to that which we haue heard: and they were commaunded that they shoulde not hurt the grasse of the earth, nor any gréene thing, nor any trée, sauing onely suche men as haue not the seale of God in their forheads, Héeretofore. 9. a. 4. Also, and all that dwell vppon the earthe shall worship him, [euen al they] whose names be not writ∣ten in the Lambes booke of life, the eyghth verse of this pre∣sent Chapter.The professiō and allowyng of wicked re∣ligion. Or in their forheads. S. To haue the marke in a mans right hand or in his forhead, is to professe and allowe wicked religion openly in word and déede. A. Which thing is done at this day, no lesse slauishly than shamelesly by all the seruants and soothers of the Pope. 17. And that no man myght buy or sell, sauing hee that hath the marke or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. The merchā∣dising of the Popes and Papists.And that no man might. &c. A. What maner of marchandi∣zing the froward merchandizing of the Antichrists is, Peter witnesseth in these words: They shall make merchandize of you through couetousnesse, with their counterfet spéeches. 2. Peter. 2. a. 3. This marketmaking is committed only too the Popes ministers, that is to say to his Cardinalles, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Channons, Monks, and such other Sacrifi∣zers. Moreouer where Antichrist reignes, it is not lawfull for any man, (be he neuer so well learned,) to preache Gods word openly, vnlesse he be marked with the marke of thys beast. S. Besides this, who knoweth not that those whome they déeme heretikes are destitute of all succoure, al defence, and all manner of things? Héere reigne the masters of the inquisition for heresie, as a man may sée in Sextus and in the Clementines, in the title concerning heretikes and the ma∣sters of the inquisition for heresie. Againe, let the forme of the oth be weyed, which the Pope exacteth of the Emperour,
of Bishops, of Doctors, and of such as are to take orders: also let the professions of the Cloisterers be looked vpon, and the beasts marke will be open and euident. Or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. S. The marke, the Name, and the number of the beast are takē al for one thing. And Iohns méening is, that no man can be frée vnder the Popes domini∣on, except he allow his abhominable tyrannie both by word and déede. For we commonly say, that he is frée, which may safly buy and sell and make his most commoditie where hée listeth. 18. Heere is vvisdome, who so hath vnderstanding, let him recken the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man, and the number of him is sixe hun∣dred sixtie and sixe. Heere is wisdome. M.S.G. Iohn addeth this to make his rea∣der giue the better héede to the things that follow. For the clause that ensueth is very darksome. VVho so hath vnderstā∣ding, let him recken the number of the beast. M. That is to saye,A darke my∣sterie. the number of Antichrist. Iohn méeneth that héere is some couert mysterie which feaw mē can vnderstād, like as Christ said of the abhominable desolation to come, which was fore∣told by the Prophet Daniel: who so readeth, let him vnder∣stand, Mat. 24. b. 15. As if he shuld say, many are able to reade that prophesie: but it is not giuen to euery man to vnderstād by & by what he redeth. For it is the number of a man. M. q. d.Antichriste is mere man and not God. Al∣though that they whome he hath deceiued do take him for a God that cannot erre: yet notwithstanding euery wise man & euery one yt hath vnderstāding, séeth that he is but a méere man, wretched and miserable as all other sinners of ye earth be.Diuersitie of opinions con∣cerning the number of the name of the beast. In respect whereof the Apostle tearmeth Antichrist the man of sin, and the child of damnation. 2. Thess. 2. b. 3. That is to say, altogither sinfull, altogither damnable, and the cause of sin and damnation vnto many. And the number of him is sixe hundred sixtie and sixe. Of this place there be welnéere as
many expositions as there be expositors. Whereby it appée∣reth, that it is very darke and riddlelike. The cause seemeth to be, for that Iohn hath simply set downe the number, with∣out adding of Mooneths, yeeres, weekes, dayes, or any other things whereof it should be the number. By reason héereof the fathers haue descanted diuersly vpon the number of the name of the beast or of Antichrist. Some haue thought that he shuld haue some certaine name, which in ye number of hys letters should yéeld the said number, according to the manner of reckning vsed by the Gréeks or Latins. And so (after some mens iudgemēts) Antichrist should be called in Gréeke An∣temos, and in Latin DicluxAntemos and Diclux. which is a feyned word. But how shall we be assured that Antichrist shall haue some such kind of name, as the letters thereof shall yéeld such a number? A∣gaine, although it were true that he should haue such a name as he might be knowen by the letters of number placed in the same: yet shoulde that be done, rather by the Hebrue let∣ters, than either by Greeke or Latin letters, and according to such a name, not as he taketh to himselfe, but as fitteth hym according to the truth of the matter. And therefore Ireneus doth well in his booke against all heresies, where he chec∣keth those that are curious in searching out the name of An∣tichrist after that maner: more rightly thē do some refer this nūber to ye time of Antichrists reigne, as well of his cōming in, as of his wearing out: to the intent that the godly myghte both withstand the enterāces of his reigning, and also beare the cōtinuance of it the more patiently. For we are sure that God hath limited the time of his reigne certaine, although it be vnknowen vnto vs, except it be reueled to vs by ye same spirit that Iohn spake this by. Notwithstanding, he war∣neth vs to thinke vpō it aduisedly, and to search for it busily. Who so hath vnderstanding (saith he) let him recken ye num∣ber of the beast &c. In which sense it was said to the king of Babylon, God hath numbred thy kingdom, Da. 5. g. 26 that is to say, the time of thy reigne. For as soone as the threscore
and ten yéeres of the thraldome of Gods people which Iere∣mie had foretold, were fulfilled: thē was the end of his reigne and kingdome at hande. Therefore it is all one as if Iohn should say, like as the reignes of men cannot be of long con∣tinuance, but are bounded by God within a certaine num∣ber of yéeres: euen so is Antichrists reigne also. Which thing is spoken to the comfort of the godly, least they might thinke the reigne of Antichrist to be without end. For it shall haue an end, and it shall giue place to Christes kingdome as well as all others do. Happie is he then which vnderstandeth thys number of ye beast, that is to say, to whome it is giuen of God to knowe that the power of Antichrist (whyche séemeth too bée inuincible and euerlasting) shall haue a time to perish. The fourtenth Chapter. AND I looked, and Lo, a Lamb standing vppon Mount Sion, and vvith him a hundred and four and fortie thousand, hauing the name of his father writ∣ten in their forheads. ANd I looked.The contents of this chap∣ter. A. In this chapter Iohn alledgeth excellēt matter of cōfort for all the godly. For he sheweth how great the strēgth and power of Christ is, whereby he plucketh al those that be his, out of the power of their enimies, and maketh them blissed euen in death. Afterward he propheci∣eth of the iudgement day to come, vnder the similitude of haruest and Grapegathering, to the intent the faithfull may waite chéerefully for the day of redemption whiche is com∣ming, and that the vngodly may at the héering thereof, either amend, or else be made vtterly vnexcusable. Lo,Christes ex∣cellent king∣dome and his mainteining of those that be his. a Lamb stan∣ding. S.G. For asmuch as in the former Chapter Iohn hathe reported the greate authoritie of both the beastes, that is too witte of Antichrist, whome the whole world wonderth at & worshippeth, who also maketh warre with the Sainctes & ouercommeth them: now least the godly might be discoraged
with so many aduersities, he matcheth héere against it the kingdome of Christ, and sheweth the excellentnesse thereof, and so comforteth the sorowfull minds of the godly, assuring them by the way, that there stādeth an excéeding great mul∣titude on the Lambes side, who kéepeth and defendeth them whome he hath redéemed with his bloud, according to hys owne saying: no mā shall plucke them out of my hand. Iohn. 10. e. 28. So also did the answer of God comfort the Prophets Elias in old time, when he thought there had bin no mo but himselfe alone left in all Israel, that had not consented to the seruing of Baal: for it was saide vnto him, that there were yet seuen thousand men left which had not bowed their knée before Baal: that is to say, ther remained a great multitude of godly people, whome it gréeued at the hart roote to sée the misworshipping and the euils that were done vnder wicked king Achab. 3. Kings. 19. d. 18. & Rom. 11. a. 4. So is it also in Ezechiel. 9. a. 4. Moreouer the Lamb in this place (like as in other places) betokeneth Christ sacrifised for vs vpō ye crosse. Vpon Mount Sion.The inuinci∣ble power of the lande. S. Mount Sion is the Counterfigure of Christes kigdome, which is his Churche: according to thys prophesie, They that trust in the Lord, like as Mount Sion &c. Psalm. 125. a. 1. And in the last dayes the hill of the Lords house shall be prepared vpon the top of hilles. Esay. 2. a. 2. Al∣so, the law shall come out of Sion, and the word of the Lorde from Ierusalem. Esay. 2. a. 3 Whiche thing the Apostle ex∣poundeth trimly, saying: But the Ierusalem whiche is from aboue is free. &c. Gal. 4. d. 26. A. And ye must marke héere the cōtrary matching of both the beasts against the Lamb. The first beast came vp out of the Sea, and the seconde out of the earth: Héeretofore. 13. a. 1. c. 11. And héere standeth the Lamb, & he standeth vpō a hill, to do vs to vnderstand, that his power is inuincible, & his kingdom euerlasting, yea & superior vnto al ye kingdoms of the world.The infinite number of the chosen. And with him a hundred and four and fortie thousand. A. Whē he spake of those yt were seduced by Antichrist, he vsed ye vniuersall word Al, in the eight and
sixtéenth verses of the last Chapter. But héere is set downe a peculiar number of the chozen, to do vs to wit, that ye more part of men doth rather fauor lyes than truth. By the way it is to be noted, that héere is put a number certaine for an vn∣certain, and a number finite for an infinite, after the manner of the scriptur, for twelue times twelue thousand make this number. And truly the number of twelue is the number of vniuersalitie and of perfectnesse: and therefore it agréeth rightly to the multitude of the chozen,The true mark of gods people. as we haue sene alrea∣dy in the fourth verse of the seuenth Chapter. Hauing the name of his father. A. This is the true marke of Gods childrē, whereby they be discerned from the wicked: namely when they sanctifye and openly professe the fathers name, both in their talke and in the whole behauiour of their life, and beare witnesse that Iesus Christ is his true and only sonne: like as the vngodly, do both set foorth with their mouth, and resemble in leawdnesse of conditions, euen Antichrist himselfe the vi∣car of Satan, as hath bin said héeretofore. 13. b. 8. d. 16. M. And therfore here is added, In their forheads. M. q. d. Such as they be within, such shew they themselues outwardly, and so professe they the Gospel aright: according to this saying: We beléeue, and therefore do we speake. 2. Cor. 4. c. 13. Let the counterfet Nicodemusses which flatter thēselues too much, marke this. 2. And I heard a voyce from heauē as it had bin the noyse of manie vvaters, and as it had bin the noyse of a great thunder: And the voyce of harpers harping vvith their harpes. And I heard a voyce &c. A. It may séeme straunge why the song that Iohn heard,Gods praises are both irke∣some and ter∣rible to the wicked. shoulde be thought to be like a greate water and a mightie thunder, seing it conteineth nothing but ioy and excéeding greate gladnesse. Besides this, what haue harps to do with thunder? But like as the word of God be∣ing of itselfe swéete and delectable, is vnto some the sauour of life vnto life, and vnto other some the sauour of deathe vntoo
death. (2 Cor. 2. d. 16:) euen so the vtterance of Gods prayses, is vnto the godly pleasant and delectable: but vnto the wicked whiche trust not in God but starcle at the rusling of euery leafe that falleth from a trée, it bringeth exceeding great ter∣ror: and the voyce of those that praise the Lord soundeth as a dreadfull thundering in the eares of them, bycause their own cōsciēces misgiue them.The wicked are afraide whither they will or no. As it had bin the noise of many waters. M. That is to say of much people: for the preachers of the gos∣pell against Antichrist are gathered togither out of many natiōs. And as it had bin the noise of a great thunder. A. As I said euen now, the vngodly are afraid when it is preached in the Gospell, that Christ is armed with singular power agaynste them. For although they sooth themselues as much as they can, bearing themselues in hand, that they shall scape scot∣free: yet can they not be but throughly afraid, whē they heere Gods iudgement spoken of: so mightie and workfull is the word of the Lord, according as it is written. 1. Cor. 14. e. 24. & Hebr. 4. c. 12.The godly get the vpper hād & are alwayes sure of the victorie. And I heard the voyce of harpers harping with their harpes. Although the faithfull must be faine to mainteine their battell against Satan, the world, and Antichrist, euen to the last end: yet notwithstanding for asmuch as they fight vnder Christes banner, they are so sure of the victorie, that they sing the song of triumph and reioycing from time too time, S. in such sort as Gods people sung after they were pas∣sed the red Sea, and the Egyptians drowned. Exod. 15 a. 1. A. So Paule, though as then he were but in the middes of his race, said, thanks be to God which hath giuen vs victorye through our Lord Iesus Christ. 1. Cor. 15. g. 57. And agayne, Thāked be God who triumpheth euermore by vs in Christ, and vttereth the sauor of his knowledge by vs in all places. 2. Cor. 2. d. 14 And in another place, we be counted (sayth he) as sheepe appointed to the slaughter: neuerthelesse, in al these things we get the vpper hande, through him which hath lo∣ued vs. Rom 8. g 36.
3. And they sing as it vvere a nevv song before the Throne, and before the foure beasts and the elders, and no man could learne the song, sauing those hundred and four and fortie thousand vvhiche vvere broughte from the earth. And they sing as it were. &c.Gods benefits require conti∣nuall prayse & thanksgiuing. S. By these words is a new be∣nefite and a new victorie commended and blazed abroade: A. like as in the psalmes there is often mētion made of a new song, for some rare and singular benefite bestowed vpon the people, or vpon Dauid, as in the Psalmes. 33. a. 3. &. 40. a. 3 S. But what if Iohn foresaw the countenance of the Church springing vp againe in these dais when the preaching of the Gospel seemeth new by reason of the purenesse and earnest∣nesse of teaching, when the manner of the restitution of the Lords supper seemeth new, when the manner of singing psalmes in common with one indifferent voice of the whole people is new, and such other kind of things: whereby there is good hope, that through the help of Christ who hath begun it already, the Babylon of wickednesse shall shortly decay e∣uery whit, or at leastwise the more part of it?The heauenly spirits reioyce at the welfare of Chrystes Church. And before the four beasts and the elders. A. The vncorrupt preaching of the Gospel is so pleasant & delectable to all the Sainctes, that the sweete sent of it doth wonderfully delight euen the heauenly spirits For the gathering togither of ye Church both of Iews & Gentiles, is as it were a glasse wherein the Angels behold yt wonderfull wisdome of God which they were not priuie to before. G.E. And therefore whē that thing began first to be per∣formed at the birth of Christ, they sung with excéeding great ioy, glory be to God on high, Luke. 2. b. 14. Also Paule saythe that Gods manifolde wisdome was made knowen to the Angels by the calling of ye Gentiles. Ephe. 3. b. 10. For it was a strange sight vnto them, that Christ should gather into hys body, the forlorne world whiche had bin estraunged so many hundred yeres from the hope of life. But how muche more
shall they wōder at the last knitting vp of Gods iustice, good∣nesse, and wisdome, when Christs kingdome shall be at the full growth? Truly that is the secret for the disclosing wher∣of, they still waite and wish hartely, and not without cause. Moreouer Christ himselfe saith, that the Angells in heauen reioyce at the amendment of sinners. Luk. 15. b. 10. C. Now if the Angels reioice among themselues in heauen when they sée that thing restored againe into their flocke which was sli∣ded away from them: much more doth it become vs (whyche are al alike and all in one cace) to be companions in the same ioy. And no man could learne the song. G. This is it whiche we haue said already: namely that the word of the Lord bringeth foorth frute, in none but such as are chosen to euerlasting life, and are borne anew, not of corruptible séede, but of immor∣tall and incorruptible séede, that is to witte, of the worde of truth. 1. Pet. 1. d. 23. & Iames. 1. c. 18. S. Those then that be either vnbeléeuers or ouerthwart Christians, (that is to wit, which pretend Christ in title and name only, and denie him in their deedes) are traitors, and serue in Antichrists Campe, & there∣fore cannot learne the sayd song, which is sung, not so muche with ye mouth, as with ye hart, acording to this text of Paules, how shal they cal vpon him in whom they beléeue not? Rom. 10. c. 14. A. Also, God sayd to the vngodly, what hast thou to do with preaching my lawes, or with taking my couenāt in thy mouth, seing thou hatest to be reformed &c? Psal. 50. e. 16.17. Truely the wicked can prayse and blisse God with mouth and tung, and also preache his worde vnto others: but they can neuer learne these things inwardly, bycause they be not verely taughte by God as the chozen sort be, who are all tearmed Theodidacti, that is to say, Taught of God. Esay. 54. f. 13. & Iohn. 6. e. 45. Sauing those hundred and foure and fortie thousand. M. That is to say, the whole number of the elect, who only are indued with the spirit of new birth, the only teacher of truth. VVhich were brought from the earth, That is to say, whom ye Lord hath set a part to himself & purchaced with his
own blud. Act. 20. f. 28. & Eph. 5. f. 25.26. In which respect christ said too his Apostles, I haue chozē you out of ye world, Iohn. 15. c. 19. Also, They are not of ye worlde, like as I also am not of ye world, Iohn. 17. c. 14. Also Paul saith, He hath plucked vs out of thys naughtie world, Gal. 1. a. 4. And Peter saith, knowing yt yée bée redéemed, not with corruptible things as Golde and siluer. &c. 1. Peter. 1. c. 18. By all which sayings the godly are warned too make themselues holy too Godward, and too set themselues a part vnto Christ, and so too leaue their old con∣uersation, and too walke in newnesse of lyfe, Rom. 6. a. 4.5.6. 4. These bee they vvhich haue not bin defiled vvith vvomen: for they bee virgins. These follovv the Lamb vvhither so euer he goeth: these are bought from a∣mong men, [and are] the first fruites vnto God and too the Lamb. These bee they which. &c.The chasti∣tie of the god∣ly as well bo∣dily as ghostly G. First he commendeth the chasti∣tie wherby the faithfull absteine from all vnlawfull copula∣tion. For when they be borne a new and made holy by the ho∣ly Ghost, they indeuor to make their whole lyfe allowable before God, and they possesse their vessell in honour and holy∣nesse, according as the Apostle Paule counselleth. 1. Thess. 4. a. 4. For euen wedlocke hath his cleannesse and chastitie by the record of the Apostle, who sayth, Mariage & the vndefyled bed is honorable in all men: but God will iudge the whore∣mongers and aduouterers. Heb. 13. a. 4. M. Also this place may bée vnderstoode of the spirituall chastitie and maydenhood of mens soules, whereof the Apostle writeth thus: I am ielous ouer you with godly ielouzie. For I haue cuppled you vntoo one husband, that yée should yéelde your selues a chaste virgin &c. 2. Cor. 11. a. 2. And Peter saythe,Who be true maydens or virgins. which haue clenzed your soules by obeying the truth throughe the spirit. 1. Petr. 1. d. 22. Those therefore be maydens and chaste in déede, which are not defyled with any whorishe medling with heretikes, nor
drowned in the inticings and deadly pleasures of this world. S. But the Papists imagine this place to be a defence to their vncleane single life ageinst lawful wedlocke:The leche∣rous single life of the papists. as who would say, that that spirituall whorehunting whereby they make a reuolting from the true worshipping of God, were not farre filthyer than the defyling of the bodie. Howbeit if they wyll needes abide by it, that it must be ment of Lecherous lust: let them first learne what thing the Scripture calleth defyling with women, and they shall see their owne vncleane and fil∣thie single life to be rather touched héere, in as much as there is no kinde of filthie lust wherevntoo they bée not subiect. For they bee virgins. A. That is too say, they kéepe their faith pligh∣ted vntoo Christ, and haue not stepped asyde from it too the deceytfull vanities of the worlde. These followe the Lambe. M. That is too saye, they followe Christ who was offered in Sacrifyce for vs.The true fo∣lowing of Christ. VVhither soeuer he goeth. Yea euen to the scaffolde of the Crosse, if néede requyre so, in persecution for defence of the truthe. This is the true following of Chryst, where through the faythfull must make themselues confor∣mable vntoo Christ, that lyke as he entered intoo hys glorie by the Crosse, Luke 24 d. 26. euen so they also should enter in∣too the kingdome of Heauen by many troubles. Acts. 14. d. 22. Also for this matter looke, Rom. 8. d. 17.18. and. 2. Tim. 2. b. 11.12. and .3. c. 12. This is the very same thing that is ment when it was sayd of the faithfull: And they haue ouercome hym by the bloud of the Lambe, and by the worde of his witnessing, and they loued not their lyues vnto the death. Heretofore. 12. c. 11. These are bought from among men. S. He repeateth that which he had saide in the last verse, too the intent that the re∣membrance of our redemption may sticke fast in our hartes. The first fruits vnto God and the Lamb.The obediēce or the faithfull is acceptble vnto God. He alludeth to the first fruits of the law, which were most deere and acceptable vnto God aboue all other oblations. Euen so, they that haue conse∣crated themselues wholly vntoo God by denying of themsel∣ues and by mortifying themselues with the crosse, following
the Lamb who was obedient too God the father euen vntoo the death of the Crosse: they cannot bée but ryght welcome vntoo God. And it is too bée marked,Then where∣fore serue Her¦mitages, An∣kerhouses, & Cloysters. howe it is too no purpose for men too séeke solitarie places, and too withdrawe themsel∣ues from the sighte of men, for the better renouncing of the world. It is God that must set vs a part, and make vs holye, that wee may bée preserued pure from the defylements of the world. 5. And there was no guile found in their mouth. For they be vvithout spot before the throne of God. And there was no guyle. &c.Pope holinesse is hated of God. A Nothing is more lothely in the sighte of the Lorde, than feyned holynesse or hypocrisie. The faithfull therefore are praysed for beeyng cleare from al guyle, and for setting more store by the simple truthe of the Gospell which they haue learned by the instruction of the ho∣lye Ghost, than by the vernished vntruthes of Antichrist and his false Apostles. C. And thereby his meaning is, that wée should rid away all glozing, and loue one another hartily. For it is a hard thing too say, how wittie well neere all men be in counterfeiting the charitie which they haue not in déede. For they not only deceiue other men, but also they beguyle them∣selues, bearing themselues in hande, that they loue those whome they not onely regarde not, but also in verye déede doo shake off. But for as muche as the vnfeyned loue is too doo good continually, P. he will haue all things doone withoute shifting, guyle, Hypocrisie, or giuing of offence. Wherfore let vs laye aside all maliciousnesse, all falsehoode, all dissi∣mulation, all backebyting, and as new borne Babes de∣syre that reasonable mylke whyche is wythoute deceyte, that wée maye growe therin. 1. Peter. 2. a. 1.2. •. For the true holynesse can no skyll of glozing, colouring, peynting, crafte, lying, or vntruthe. For they bee wythoute spotte.How the god∣ly be holie pure and righ¦tuous. A. Althoughe the godly bée put too reprooche in this world, and bée made as it were the of skorings of the worlde and
the reffuse of all things euen to this day. 1. Cor. 4. c. 13. yet are they déerlibeloued of God for his sonne Iesus Christes sake. The world déemeth them the arrantest naughtipackes and varlets of men liuing: but God accounteth them for the pu∣rest and holyest, bycause (as is sayd alreadie) they haue made their garments white in the bloud of the Lamb: Heretofore, 7. d. 14. Then are the faithful in themselues, vnrighteous, vn∣cleane, and sinfull, Rom. 3. b. 9.10.11. but in Christe they bée righteous, cleane, and vnblamable, according as Paule tea∣cheth, Rom. 8. a. 4. & Ephe. 1. a. 4. &. 5. f. 16. 6. And I savve another Angell flying through the middes of Heauen, hauing the euerlasting Gospell, too preache glad tydings too them that dvvell vpon the earthe, and vntoo all nations, and kinreds, and tungs, and people. The duetie of faithfull prea∣chers.And I sawe another Angell. G. He returneth to the descripti∣on of the preaching of the Gospel, by the truth wherof Christ preserueth his from Antichristes guyles and from other er∣rors. This Angell betokeneth any manner of faithfull prea∣cher of the Gospell in the time of Antichristes persecution. Flying. S. That is too saye, running héere and there chéerfully without care of worldly things, and plying busily the prea∣ching of the Gospell, in exhorting the godly, neuer to suffer themselues too bée plucked away from the Gospell either by promises or by threatnings, nor to consent to the abhomina∣tions of Antichristes false prophets. And this to do, Timothy is counselled by Paul, who saith: Watch thou in al things, harden thy selfe ageinst afflictions, go through with the work of a preacher of the Gospell, make thy seruice allowable too the full. And a little afore he sayth, Preach the word, bée ear∣nest in season and out of season, disproue, rebuke, and exhort with al gentlenesse and instruction. 2. Tim. 4. a. 2. Through the middes of heauen. M. That is too saye, through the middes of
the Church, not preaching particularly to some one Church, but indifferently vntoo all Churches, and teaching rounde a∣bout him, and drawing the same Churche vntoo Gospellike conuersation by his worde and example. A. After this maner Paul saith he had a singular care and regard of al Churches, 2. Cor. 11. f. 28. Hauing the euerlasting Gospell.Why the gos∣pell is sayde to be euerlasting. S.G. An honorable tytle of the Gospel. And it is called euerlasting, first bycause it bringeth and behyghteth good things: according to this text, he that beléeueth in mée hath life euerlasting. Iohn. 6. c. 47. A. And this is the promise which he hath assured vs of, euen e∣uerlasting life. 1. Iohn. 2. d. 25. Secondly, bycause that accor∣ding too Paules saying, there is none other Gospell too bée loo∣ked for, no not euen at an Angell from Heauen. Gal. 1. b. 8. Thirdly bicause it was promised long ago by the prophetes in the holy Scriptures, Rom. 1. a. 2. A. Like as when it was sayd, The womans seede shall breake thy head. Gene. 3. c. 15. and also, In thy séede shall all Nations of the earth be blissed, Gen. 22. d. 18. Lastly, the Gospell is termed euerlasting, bicause it shall indure for euer maugre all the vngodly. For Christes reigne is such as shal haue none ende. Luke. 1. d. 33. &. 1. Cor. 15. d. 27. for it consisteth in spirit and truth and not in outwarde things: according as is sayd, All the gloriousnesse of the kings daughter is frō within. Psal. 45. d. 13. But contrariwise,Wherein the Church of An∣tichrist con∣sisteth. An∣tichrists kingdome is outward, consisting in great Churches gorgeously builded, in Belles, Organes, Shrines, Images, Tapers, houge summes of gold and siluer, superfluitie of ap∣parell, great troupes of horses, great traynes of seruauntes, and all things fellowlike with the chéefest Princes: so as it is easie too bée séene of all godly men, that he is not the Vicar of Christe, as he vaunteth, but flatly of Satan, and so conse∣quently that his kingdome can not last long.The Papistes slander Gods worde wth vnsufficiencie. Also it is gathe∣red of this place, that when the Papistes saye that Chrystes Gospell is not ynough too rule the Church by, but that it hath néede of the Bishops Canons: it is an open blasphemie, in as muche as it is vtterly most true that the cause why the
Church stādeth fast for euer, is for that it is ruled by Christs woord in the holie Ghost. And therefore it is most certeyne, that they are nothing lesse than Chrystes Church, whosoeuer they bée that reuerence and honour the Byshop of Rome more than Chryst, or make more account of the Popes Ca∣nons than of Christes Gospell: but they bée the seede that fell in the high way, vpon stones, and among the bréers: they bée the cockle and darnell among the wheate: they be rottē fishes and foolish virgins: finally they go out as swyne walowing in the myre, and as doggs returning too their vomit: & so con∣sequently they bée the Synagog of Satan. Math. 13. e. 38. &. 25. a. 2. &. 2. Pet. 2. d. 22. & heretofore. 2. c. 9. All which things would God that they which take so great delyghte still in the Popes dirtie Ceremonies, would throughly consider. To preach glad tydings. M. That is too say, to tell good and ioyfull things well and chéerfully. q. d. Not to lay it vp in a chist, not to muse vpon it in his hart only, nor to hide it in the ground as the slouthful seruant did, Math. 25. b. 18. but to vtter it diligently & corage∣ously.The godly are sorie to se true Religion des∣pised and Su¦perstition ad∣uaunced. To them that dwell vpon the earth. Word for word it is, to them that sit vpon the earth. And that is a Metaphor, that is to say, a conueying of the word from his proper meaning too the betokening of another thing. For to sit downe vpon the earth is the maner of such as are in sorow or heauinesse, and of such as are almost out of hart by reason of the myseries & abhominations that reigne rounde about them. Wherby al∣so there is an incling giuen, that the godly are very sorie that Gods word, and consequently that the true worshipping of him should bée despised, and detestable abhominations thrust vpō ye simple vnder the name of godly Religion: & that Gods people shoulde bée ouermated with so great excesse, so great pryde, and so straunge crueltie, specially by such as boast thē∣selues too bée Christes Vicars, the Apostles successors, the seruauntes of Gods seruaunts, and such other kind of things. Too such manner of troubled folke is the euerlasting Gospell of glad tydings preached, accordyng too this saying of our sa∣uiour.
The poore haue the glad tidings of the Gospel preached vnto them. Mat. 11. a. 5. Also, He sent me to bring glad, tidings that I might heale the brokē harted, and preach releasement vnto prisoners. &c. Luke. 4. c. 19.The discoue∣rie of Anti∣christ nd the calling of the Gentyles- And vnto all Nations and kin∣reds. This tidings is ment of the discouering of Antichryste. For when Christ and his spirituall reigning is reuealed by the preaching of the Gospell: then out of hand the darkenesse of errors is laid open therby as by the light, and the vntruth is taken tardie by bringing forth the truth, & so is Antichrists kingdome bewrayed. 2. Thessa. 2. b. 8. This Gospell (saythe Christ) shal bee preached ouer all the world, and then shal the knitting vp come. Math. 24. b. 14. Which thing is thought too belong not so muche too the forespring of the Churche in the tyme of the Apostles, as too the afterspring of it in these our dayes. By the way, this place witnesseth manyfestly the cal∣ling of the heathē, according too that which was foretold by the Prophetes, and afterwarde confirmed by Christ and his Apostles, Math. 8. b. 11. and Iohn. 10. c. 16. and Rom. 15. b. 9.10.11.12. and Ephe. 2. d. 17. Also looke in the .ix. verse of the seuenth chapter heretofore. 7. Saying vvith a loud voyce: Feare God and giue honour vnto him: for the houre of his iudgement is come. And vvorship ye him that made heauen & earth and the sea, and the springs of vvaters. Saying with a loud voyce. A. The Gospell must bée vttered,The open preaching of the Gospell. not with the mouth half shet, but with an open & loud voyce, bycause it conteyneth the whole summe of mans welfare in it. In respect whereof Paule saide, Pray ye for me that vtte∣rance maye bée giuen mée too open my mouth boldly, so as I maye vtter the Secretes of the Gospell, whereof I am a messenger in bondes, that therein I maye speake freely as it becommeth mée too doo. Ephe. 6. d. 19. Also Chryst sayd too his Disciples, looke what I saye vntoo you in the darke, speake you it in the lighte. &c. Math. 10. c. 27. S. Greate and
earnest affection therfore, great assurednesse, & great auouch∣ment of scriptures had they néede too haue, that minde too as∣sayle Antichrist and to destroy his kingdome after it hath ta∣ken so deepe roote. All the cunning, all the labour resteth vpō this poynt, that the Princes and wise men of the world togi∣ther with the simple sort, being perswaded with effectual per∣swasions, may at length vnderstande, that this glorious eye seruice, is but a mockerie of Satan, and an vtter abhomina∣tion before God: like as it was a hard matter in old time too make the Iewes beléeue, that the seruice of Moses Law was vaine after that Christ was once exalted: but it was no hard matter to make the Gentiles beléeue that the worshipping of Idolls was vaine and fond.The whole seruing of God who only is to be feared. Feare God. In this place (as in manie other,) the feare of God comprehendeth all the whole seruing of him. Howbeit héere is mention made of feare by name, too doo vs too wit, that it is the propertie of the Gospell too call backe the faithfull from the feare of men, too the feare of God. As if the sayd preacher of the Gospell should say, Bée yée not afraid of Antichrist, how great power soeuer he séeme too bée indued withall: for the pomp of it is but emptie and vaine. But stand yée in awe of the true Lorde God who kno∣weth all things, can do all things, createth all things, and go∣uerneth and preserueth all things. Looke you vp at him only, worship yée him onely, and serue yée him only. So said Elias too the people, If the Lord bée God, follow yée him, and leaue Baal. 3. Kings. 18. d. 21. And Christ sayth, Bée not afrayd of thē that kill the bodie and cannot kill the soule: but feare ye him rather which can destroy both body and soule intoo hell fyre. Math. 10. c. 28. And Iames sayth, There is but one Law ma∣ker which is able too destroy and too saue. Iames. 4. c. 12. Then is he onely too bée feared and worthie of all honour: whervp∣on it followeth.The honoring of God. And giue yee honour vntoo him. G. There can no greater honor bée yéelded vntoo God, than too receyue hys worde by faith, and to obey his voyce: A according as Moses sayth: And now Israell, what doth the Lord God require of
thée, but that thou shouldest loue him. &c. Deut. 10. c. 12.Gods laste iudgement. For the houre of his iudgement is come. S.G Namely wherein he wyll shew himselfe by manifest déede and working, that he is the God and Lord, & iudge of the world, when he shal slea the vn∣godly with the dreadful blast of the breth of his mouth: Esai. 11. a. 4. &. 2. Thessa. 2. b. 8. when he shall cut the naughtie ser∣uant asunder, and giue him his portion among the hypocrits, Mat. 24. d. 51. A. When he shal make all his enemies his foote∣stoole. 1. Cor. 15. c. 25. S. And it séemeth that this manner of dili∣gent & earnest preaching of the word, shall be sent before the second comming of the iudge Christ, to the end that the godly may be comforted, & that suche as be seduced (being curable) may be driuē to amendment by feare, or being stubborne and wilfull, may bée made vnexcusable.The myghti∣nesse of God and the weak∣nesse of idolls. And worship yee him that made Heauen and Earth. A. By a couert matching of contra∣ries, Gods myghtinesse is compared with the vayne brauery and gloriousnesse of Antichryst. S. q.d. Wherefore wonder ye at the presumptuousnesse of this man? Wherefore are yee afrayde of him? wherefore humble ye your selues vnto him, sith he is not able too doo any at all of these things, and sithe he is not able too make so much as a little worme, or so much as a little sillie floure? So also doo the Prophetes set before mennes eyes and imprint in their hartes the power of God, by his woorkes, and the weakenesse of the false gods by the contrarie. Esai. 41. f. 22.23. and Iere. 2. f. 28. and so did Paule also in Act. 14. c. 15. &. 17. f. 23.24. 8. And there follovved another Angell saying, Ba∣bilon that great Citie is falne, is falne, bicause she made all Nations too drinke of the vvyne of the vvrathe of hir vvhoredome. And there followed another Angell, saying. M. Bycause the mi∣nisters of Gods word succeede one another, and no one man alone were able to woorke all ye things that are necessarie for
the abolishing of Antichristes kingdome: Another Angell is said héere to followe the former, to declare the destruction of the child of perdition constantly and vnfearfully. For it is de∣termined by ye vnauoydable purpose of God, that his King∣dome shall decay at the appoynted time, A. bicause that onely Christes kingdome is euerlasting.Rome the chiefe seate of Antichrist, al∣beit that Ba∣bylon repre∣sent the whole worlde. Babylon that greate Citie. A. This is the same which erst was called Sodom, and Egipt and the Citie where our Lord was crucifyed, Heretofore, 11. b. 8. Which maye be ment of Rome, where the confusion of the lawe of the Gospell, and of Gods seruice hath reigned a long time. S. And it is called a great Citie, bycause the great∣nesse and multitude of hir wicked doings haue borne sway in all Nations: in such wise as not only Rome, but also euen all the whole world may be called Babilō, considering how hir wickednesse, confusion, contempt of Gods worde, and Idola∣trie haue of late ouerspred welnéere all partes of the world. Therefore he that wyll go out of Babylon,What it is to fee out of Babylon. must bee fayne to take his last leaue of the world, yt is to say, he must renounce all the lustes of the worlde, that he maye serue Christe. Wherevntoo the Apostles exhort vs, Rom. 12. a. 2. &. 1. Cor. 7. f. 31. & Ephe. 4. f. 24. &. 1. Petr. 2. a. 2. and. 1. Iohn. 2. b. 15. &. 5. d. 19. S G. So by this message of Iohns, the godly are not so muche comforted, as those that bee curable in that great Citie, bée warned too get them out of it with all hast possible, least they runne intoo endlesse damption for companie, with the rest of hir inhabiters. Is falne, is falne. S.G. The dubling of a word doth oftentimes in the Scripture betoken the certeintie and sure∣nesse of a determination that cannot be called backe.The cause why wicked∣nee reigned in the worlde. Bycause shee made all Nations to drinke. &c. M. q.d. Manie were led out of the way by hir, when Vices reigned euery where in sted of vertues: as Simonie, Couetousnesse, Lust, contempte of Gods word, whoredome, vncleannesse and suche lyke. And wheras héere is mention made of wrath: wée gather thervp∣on, that Gods wrath (yea euen his ryghtfull wrath) was the cause that wickednesse bare sway among al Natiōs through
the whole worlde, to the intent that the godly myght in the meane while be exercised and tryed, so as their faith myghte bée better fyned than gold, & the spouse of Christ be as a Rose beset round about with thornes. Ballets. 2. a. 2. A Whervpon Paule writeth to the Philippians in this wyse. Bée ye pure as the children of God, and vnblamable in the middes of that lewd and crooked Nation, among whom shine yée as lyghtes in the world, holding fast the word of truth. Phil. 2. b. 15. S. As concerning the wyne of whoredome yée shall finde a larger discourse hereafter in the seconde verse of the seuentéenth Chapter. 9. And a third Angell follovved them, saying vvith a loud voyce: If any man vvorship the beast, and his image, and receyue his marke in his forehead or in his right hand. And there followed a third Angell. A. All Gods giftes are not bestowed vpon all men alike,God giueth not his giftes nor dis∣closeth his se∣cretes to all men, nor at all tymes. but (as I said alate) eche man hath a sundry charge inioyned him at the discretion of the ho∣ly Ghost. Besides this, God discloseth not all his secretes too euery man, nor all at one time: but vnto whom, and when he listeth: least any man myghte maruell why diuers thyngs were hidden from the fathers of old time, which are knowen to the Church in these last dayes. And therfore here foloweth a third Angell, which declareth Gods iudgement ageinst all such as set so much store by the ouerthwart doctrine of An∣tichrist, that they are not afrayd to professe it openly. If any mā worship the beast, C. That is too say, whosoeuer shapeth hym∣selfe lyke vntoo Antichrist in lyfe and learning. And receiueth his marke in his forehead. M. That is to saye, he that followeth him in worke, or openly defendeth his tyrannie by counsel∣ling or fauouring it, A. accordyng as is sayde héeretofore, 13. d. 16.
10. The same shall drinke of the vvyne of Gods vvrath,Some reade: which is pouted into the cup of his wrath. vvhich is mingled vvith sheere vvine in the cup of his vvrath: and he shall be tormented vvith fire and brimstone in the sight of the holie Angells, and be∣fore the sight of the Lamb. Gods venge∣ance.The same shall drinke. &c. M. That is too wit, of the venge∣ance that shall bée layd vpon the vnrepentant. I say, He shall drinke. For lyke as drinke maketh men drunken, and not meat: euen so shall euerlasting damnation swallow vp those whom it catcheth, both bodie and soule. VVhych is myngled with sheere wyne. B.The sundrie taking of the word cup. The transposing of the woorde Cup from his owne proper signification, both in good parte and in euill, is very ryfe in the Scriptures. For God hath allotted vntoo euery mā hys portion of prosperitie or aduersitie by measure certeyne, and he shall drinke it whyther he wyll or no. In this sentence following it is taken in ill part: The spirit of tempest is the portion of their Cup. Psalm. 11. b. 6. That is too say, Vengeance is the rewarde that God hathe ordeyned for their wickednesse. In these sentences following it is taken in good parte. The Lorde is the Lot of my parte, and of my Cup. Psalm. 16. b. 5. That is too saye, he is my portion and appoynted heritage. Also, my ouerflowing Cup. Psal, 23. b. 4. That is too say, The goods whiche God hath giuen vnto me as my Lot, are abundant. Moreouer Chryst saythe, Can yée drinke of the Cup that I shall drinke? Math. 20. c. 22. M. By whiche woordes Christ demaunded of the sonnes of Zebedie, whyther they were able too indure the Crosse and tormentes that he should suffer. For so is ment by drinking of the Cup that he shoulde drinke of.The sore tor∣mēts of them that worship the beast. And he shall bee tormented with fyre and brimstone. G Iohn inhaunceth the punishment of the dam∣ned sorte, too the intent that men shoulde the more abhorre the worshipping of the beast, which is accompanyed with so great a tormente. By the tormente of fire, the Scripture is
wont to betoken the sorest tormentes that can be: and in the worde brimstone which is a matter that mainteineth fyre, there séemes to bée an allusion to places of brimstone which burne continually, such as is Mount Etna in Sicill. Wher∣by it is ment, that the sayd fire is vnquenchable, such as the scripture describeth in Esai. 10. d. 16. &. 66. g. 24. &. Mat. 3. c. 12. & Mark. 9. g. 43. Heerby therefore it appeareth to be most true, which the Lord hath forespoker concerning the despyzers of the Gospell, namely, whosoeuer receiueth you not, nor heer∣eth your sayings, when yée go out &c. Verely I say vnto you, it shal be easyer for the land of Sodom and Gomorrhe in the day of iudgement than for that Citie. Mat. 10. b. 15. In the sight of the holy Angels. M. It is an inhauncemēt. For it greatly in∣creaseth our gréefe, to be tormēted in the sight of them whose counsell we had hild scorne of afore,Difference of Angels. & whom wée persecuted most eagrely. A. The worde Holy is added for a difference be∣twene them & the bad Angells whō God spared not for theyr sinnes. 2. Pet. 2. a. 4. Of whō also it is said, Go ye cursed intoo euerlasting fire prepared for the diuill & his Angels. Mat. 25. d. 41. Also, know ye not that we shal iudge ye Angels. 1. Cor. 6. a. 2. for a difference frō these, the other are called holie, good, & chozen or elect. 2. Tim. 2. d. 10.21. At yt time therfore it shall ap∣peere, how truly Christ said, whosoeuer is ashamed of me and my sayings in this misbegotten & sinful generatiō of him shal the sonne of mā be ashamed when he cōmeth in the glorie of his father with the holy Angels, Marke. 8. d. 38. And before the sight of the Lambe. S. This also maketh to the inhauncement. q.d. Not only ye holy Angels that stand about Christ, shall not pitie the damned soules: but also not euē the Lamb himselfe, who other whiles is of nature most méeke, and foreward too compassion, can bée moued at that tyme. What roome then shall there bée for mercye at that day, when not euen the Lambe shall haue mynde of any mercye, A but shall shewe hymselfe lyke an angrie and ryght dreadfull Lyon? Ther∣fore let no man despyze Christ bycause he is a méeke & méeld
Lambe, for at the length he will come forth as a myghtie Li∣on, armed with power to destroy all hys enemyes: according as he himselfe hath foretold, saying: As for those enemies of mine whiche would not haue me to reigne ouer them, bring them hither and kill them before mée. Luke. 19. d. 27. 11. And the smoke of their torment shall go vp for e∣uermore: neither shal they haue any rest day nor night vvhich vvorship the beast and his image, and vvhosoe∣uer receiueth the marke of his name. And the smoke of their tormente shall go vp for euermore. A By these wordes he dooth vs too wit, that the punishment of the damned shall bée euerlasting, like as it is sayde, These shall go into euerlasting torment, Math. 25. d. 46. S. Howbeit some of the Anabaptistes reuiuing ageine the heresie of O∣rigen,The endlesse damnation of the reprobats whereby the error of Ori∣gen, and of the Anabaptistes is confuted. expounde for euermore, or for euer and euer, or worlde without ende, and such other woordes & spéeches, but for a long time, bycause they bée so taken in some places of the scrip∣ture: and so they promyse saluation at length euen vntoo the diuells, and too the wicked that bée damned (as vnto the trai∣tour Iudas) and vntoo all sinners bée they neuer so farre past grace. But vayne and fond is such manner of exposition. For by the same reason, it myght bée gathered of like places, that the lyfe of the godly after this present lyfe shall one day haue an end. The same thing might bee said of Christs kingdome, yea & of God himselfe, who is auouched both to reigne and too liue euerlastingly, and also for euer and euer. But what will they answere too those places where the punishmente of the wicked is simply and absolutely said too bée endlesse, wythout addition of any of these wordes and spéeches, For euer and euer, Continually, Euerlastingly, For euer, Euermore, E∣ternally, and suche other sayings if any bée of the lyke signi∣fication? Accordyng as it is in the Prophet, Their worme shall not dye, nor theyr fyre go out. Esai. 66. g. 24. Also there
is mention made of vnquenchable fire, in Mat. 3. c. 12. & Mark 9. g. 43.45.47. and Luke. 13. d. 28. And Paule sayth expressely, neyther whoremonger, nor yet wedlockebreaker shal inhe∣rite the Kingdome of God. 1. Corin. 6. b. 9.10. That whiche maye at anye tyme (bée it after neuer so long a tyme) bée quenched, cannot bée sayde too bée vnquenchable: and they which shall inherite the kingdome of God, can not at anye tyme, (thoughe it bée also after neuer so long a tyme) haue it sayde of them simply, that they shall not inherite it. And after this manner maye it bée reasoned of all other such like places of the Scripture. Moreouer whereas he saythe the smoke of theyr torment, it caryeth a vehemencie wyth it.God requi∣reth the ser∣uis of ye whole man both in∣ward and out∣warde. For else a cléere fyre pretendeth a pleasantnesse. Neyther shall they haue any reste daye nor nyght. Ageyne he auoucheth, that theyr tormentes shall endure euerlastingly. A. Speaking erst of the foure beastes, he had sayde: They haue no reste daye nor nyghte, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy Lorde God al∣myghtie. Heeretofore. 4. c. 8. And nowe he saythe the same ageyne, howbeit too a farre other purpose: namely that the damned persons shall haue no reste. For lyke as the o∣ther was ment of euerlasting ioy: so thys is mente of end∣lesse payne. VVhich worship the beast, and his image. That is too say, which yéelde vntoo Antichrist the honour that is due vntoo Christ. And whosoeuer receiueth the marke of hys name. That is to say, whosoeuer professeth the seruing of Antichrist in outwarde worke, as is sayde héeretofore, 13. d. 16. S. In times paste some haue thought it a matter of small importance, for a man too caste a fewe cornes of frankinsence intoo the fire too saue hys lyfe wythall: whyche thyng Pope Marcelline is reported too haue doone vpon perswasion. So perhappes at thys daye it séemeth too skill lyttle or nothyng, thoughe menne graunt the Pope too bée Chrystes Vicar and the most holye and blissed father, thoughe they bée present at Masse, though they reuerently worship the Sacrament shut vp in a box, and the images of Saincts, and to outward appéerance
vse the residue of the Popishe ceremonies, too the intent they may saue theyr own skinne and theyr worldly goods, so they beléeue vpon Christ in theyr hart, and put no trust at all in the other things: and so had leuer too play Nicodemus, than too professe Christ openly wyth the losse of theyr lyfe & goods, by despyzing or condemning such manner of Ceremonies. As who woulde saye, it were not Christ that sayde, whoso∣euer acknowledgeth mée before men, I also wyll acknow∣ledge hym before my Father whych is in heauen: and who∣soeuer denyeth mée before men, him wyll I also denie before my father whych is in Heauen. Math. 10. d. 32.33. And Paule saythe, The beléefe of the hart maketh ryghtuous, and the confession of the mouth maketh a man safe. Roma. 10. b. 10. Now if it were lawfull too dissemble so in Christes matters: truely the Christians of the primitiue Church myght haue worshipped Christ without impeachment of their lyues or goods. But whosoeuer renounceth not all these thyngs for Christes sake, cannot bée hys Disciple. Too bée a true Chri∣stian, is altogither a gentleman lyke, a stately, yea and a rare thing. And this séemeth too bée the cause why Iohn bea∣teth so often vpon these things and consequently addeth. 12. Heere is theSome reade. Here is the for∣bearing of. &c. Patience of the Sainctes, heere are they that keepe the commaundementes of God and the faith of Iesus. True stout∣nesse and mā∣lynesse.Heere is the patience of the Sainctes. G. q. d. The godly must take matter of patience from hence, that they sée so manye tormentes lingering for suche as haue lefte Chryst and are become vnderlings too the Beaste. The Sainctes thinke it more for theyr behoofe too byde the boysteousnesse of ye beast which lasteth but a whyle, than the horrible wrath of ye iudge the Lambe, which lasteth euer. For it is a sore matter too fall intoo the hands of the liuing God. Heb. 10. f. 31. S. Now therfore wée haue néede of corage, nowe wée haue néede of stoute sto∣macks,
that we be not ashamed of Christ before men, least while we séeke to shunne the inconueniences of this life, wée fall into euerlasting peynes: according to this prouerb, he that shūneth Charibdis falleth into Scilla, or he that shunnes the smoke falles into ye fire. And, they that feare the hore frost haue the snow to light vpon them. Iob. 6. c. 16. Also, he that lo∣ueth his life shall lose it. Iohn. 12. d. 25. Rich men and men of authoritie are as ware as may be that they suffer no losse for the Gospells sake: and in the end they perish wretchedly for their labour.No man can serue bothe God & Belial Heere are they that keepe the commaundements of God. A. The kéeping of Gods commaundements is matched couertly against the kéeping of mens commaundements. For seing that no man is able to serue two masters at once: as many as fauor Antichrist and sticke to his lawes, must néeds renounce Christe, according to this texte, they worship me in vaine, teaching doctrines that are the precepts of men. Mat. 15. a. 9. And the faith of Iesus. For asmuch as the whole summe and perfection of the law is conteined in Christes Gospel: the faith of Iesu is rightly added next to the kéeping of Gods cō∣maundements.Wee neede to seeke no fur∣ther but to the Gospell for Gods will. By whiche tearme Iohn doth vs to vnder∣stand, that Gods will is vttered vnto vs in the Gospell: least any man might surmise himselfe to yéeld God his due honor, when he refuzeth Christ speaking in the Gospell. For he that honoreth not the sonne, honoreth not him that sent him. Iohn. 5. d. 23. S. Therefore when the beast presseth vs to im∣brace his doctrine, héere must be our chéefe watching, héere must be our chéefe laboring, that we forsake not the com∣maundementes of God and the faith of Iesu. For it is bet∣ter to fall into the handes of men, than to sin in the syghte of God. A. Wherfore if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but rather let him glorifye God in that be∣hafe. 1. Pet. 4. d. 16.
Some reade, Blissed hereaf∣ter be the dead, those (I say) whi∣che dye for the Lordes sake. Yea sayth the Spirit: for they reste from their la∣bours, and their &c. The comfort of the faithful.13. And I heard a voyce from heauen, saying vntoo me, vvrite: Blissed are the dead that dye in the Lorde hensefoorth. Yea (saith the spirit) that they may rest from their labours, but their vvorks follovv them. And I heard a voyce. A Least the warfare of the faithfull might séeme too hard to be borne out to the end, Iohn layeth foorth very great rewards for suche as fyght faithfully and manfully in Christs behalfe. G. And like as he hath héereto∣fore layde foorthe the horrible tormentes of Idolaters as it were before mens eyes: so now he setteth foorth the blissed rest and continuall ioy of the faithfull, to the intent that eue∣ry of vs should rather striue to go to the heauenly kingdome through persecutiō, than desire to enioy our pleasures in this present life to the losse of our soules. From heauen. A. This is added least any man might doubt of the truth and certaintie of the Oracle insuing. q. d. It is God that promiseth, who is also able to performe the thinges that he promiseth. VVrite. M.The right vse of Scripture. Verely as well in thy hart as in thy booke, for the remem∣brance of those that are to come, to the end that their posteri∣tie may take comfort at it. For the right vse of scripture is, to edify the faith of such as are to come, and to giue comforte vniuersally vnto all the godly,Who they bee that die in the Lorde, & their happie states. as it is to be séene in Rom. 15. a. 4. &. 2. Tim. 3. d. 16. Blissed be the dead. Ergo euen the dead do liue vnto God: for there can be no happinesse where deathe hath power. VVhich dye in the Lord. S. This must be referred specially to the comfort of those whome the beast shall put to death for speaking against him. q. d. The deathe is not to bée feared which a man dieth for the Lords cace: for they that die so shall be happie out of hand, and frée from all labours after∣ward, yea and they shall haue euerlasting rest with Chryst. B. Moreouer they die in the Lorde, as many as are slaine for despising and condemning the religion of the Pope or of Ma∣humet: no lesse than they did which in olde time despised ey∣ther the Iewish Ceremonies which were extincted and abro∣gated,
or the religion of the Idols after that Christ was ex∣alted. A. And this happie or blissed state of the godly, is mat∣ched against the iudgement of the flesh and the world: as if it were said, although the godly being as shéepe apointed to the slaughter, séeme most miserable of all men in the sight of the world: yet is it as certaine as certaine may be, that they bée blissed in the sight of God S. For precious in the Lords sighte is ye death of his Saincts. Psa. 116. c. 14. Hencefoorth. A S. Some following the old translation, ioyne this parcell [hencefoorth] to the next sentence. S. But the Greekes point it so, as hence∣foorth is the end of the last sentence: so as the méening should be, that hereafter they shall be happie which die in the Lorde. M. Which thing is to be meant of al righteous persons which departe out of this mortall body full of faith, but specially of those that be slaine for the Gospels sake, as hath bin saide a∣fore. Yea. S. This particle graunteth or confirmeth a thing. Sayth the Spirit. A. Supply thou the word Holy, who is the on∣ly teacher of truth. That they may rest frō their labours. S.The labours of the godlie and the vn∣godly, and the ouerthrow of popish Pur∣gatorie. Dout∣lesse a very great ground of comfort and gladnesse. B. The la∣bors of the godly are soone ended héere, and after them ensu∣eth endlesse rest. Contrariwise the vngodly are loth their la∣bours should come to an end, and they shall find them euerla∣sting. A. according as it is said, that they shall haue no rest day nor night, in the eleuenth verse of this Chapter. Wonderfull is the vnskilfulnes or rather madnesse of the Papists, which reade this text of Iohns in their Obits for the dead, whose soules they thought to be pained in the fyre of purgatory, whereas this place doth manifestly ouerthrow their forgerie of the fire of purgatory, as much as any place can do. S. For in this place the holy Ghost warranteth blissednesse and rest vnto the godly from all their labours and troubles, immedi∣atly from the houre that they dye in the Lord, that is to saye, from the houre that they depart out of this life, stedfast in the faithe of Christe: according as Christe himselfe auoucheth, saying: verely verely I say vnto you, he that heereth my
word & beléeueth in him that sent me, hathe life euerlasting, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death into life. Iohn. 5. d. 24 A. Also Paul saith, Then is there no damnation to them that be graffed in Christ Iesu, whych walke not after the flesh but after the spirit. Rom. 8. a. 1. And the Lord sayth by his Prophet, I will be alone with them as touching their vnrighteousnesse and sin, and I will no more remēber their iniquities Iere. 31. f. 34. & Heb. 8. d. 12. S. Besides this, Lazarus was caried by Angels into Abrahams bosome. Luke. 6. e. 22. And vnto the theefe as he hung vpon the Crosse, it is said, This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise. Luk. 23. f. 43. Also, I long to be let looce (saith Paule) and to be with Christ. Phil. 1. d. 23. Who then is able to consider the madnes of these men sufficienly? Are the Popes sale bulles able to do so muche for men, that they whiche can get them shall flye strait wayes into heauen and neuer feele the peines of Pur∣gatorie, (which thing they promis:) and shal not the almigh∣tie powr of Christ be able to do it? B. All these thinges wyth such other like,Mens soules doe neither die nor fal asleep. are not only against the Popish Purgatory, but also against those that thinke mens soules to die or fall a∣sleepe with their bodies, and to be raised vp againe at length with their bodies. Against whome is also this text, God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing, Mat. 22. c. 32. Then are the Saincts aliue in respect of the soule which is the bet∣ter part of them: and their bodies be in the meane while re∣serued and layd vp in the earth to the regeneration that is too come, like as corne is to the haruest. 1. Cor. 15. e. 36. A. Also we sée how Iohn (or rather howe the holie Ghost who inditeth these things vnto Iohn) maketh no word at all in this place,Intercession or Sainctes deceassed. concerning the intercession of the Sainctes deceased: albeit that he treateth purposely of their state. Onely he assureth them of blissednesse and rest from their labours: and as for the praiers which they should poure out for vs, ther is no mē∣tion of them. Whervpon we gather that those men haue delt vnaduisedly, which haue borne folke in hand without war∣rant
deceased do make intercession for them. But for these things looke more in the third verse of the eight Chapter heretofore But their works follow thē. M.S. It is a transposing of tearmes:The rewar∣ding of the works of the godlie. for works are put for Reward: like as Paule also saith, Looke what a man soweth, that shall he reape. Gal. 6. b. 7. Also, wée must all appéere before Christes iudgement seate, that euery man may receiue the things that be done by the body, accor∣ding to that which he hath wrought, be it good or bad. 2. Cor. 5. d. 10. A. If any man demaund why mention is made héere of workes rather than of faithe, seing we be iustifyed only by faith: the answer is in a redinesse: namely that fayth is not excluded when workes whiche spring out of faith are alled∣ged. For it is certaine that all the workes of men which pro∣céede not of faith, are not only vaine, but also filthy and ab∣hominable in the sight of God, B. according as the Apostle saith, what soeuer is not of faith is sinne. Rom. 14. d. 23. More∣ouer Iohn had commended faith sufficiently when he sayde, that the dead whiche dye in the Lord are happie euer after.What it is to die in the lord. A. For what else is it to die in the Lord, thā to hold the beleefe of his word surely and stedfastly euen to the last end of life? And as for the reward of workes looke in the eighth verse of the eleuenth Chapter héeretofore. 14. And I looked, and lo a vvhite Cloude, and vpon the Cloude one sitting like the sonne of man, hauing on his head a crovvne of gold, and in his hand a sharpe Sythe. And I looked. G. After that Iohn hath treated of Antichrists tyrannie and the persecutions of the godly:A forme of Gods iudge∣ment, & howe Gods iudge∣ment is to bee consydered. now he treateth of Gods iudgement, that al the godly may take comfort ther∣by. For the troubles of the godly must not be so looked at, as though ther were nothing else to be considered: (for thē were there nothing else to be séene but matter of despayre.) But we must alwayes haue an eye therewithall vnto Gods iust iudgement against the wicked persecuters, & vnto his ready
help, whereby he comforteth his seruants and raiseth them vp to good hope, & also vnto the most ample reward that ensu∣eth. Daniel hath described these things vnto vs notably wher he speaketh of ye little horne that spake blasphemies. I looked (saith he) vntill stooles were set, & the auncient of yéeres sate downe, whose raimēt was white as snow, & the heare of hys head as pure wooll, whose throne were fyrie flames, and hys whéeles a burning fyre. &c. Da. 7. c. 9. As if he should say, I cō∣sidered al these things, namely whither the godly shoulde bée persecuted euermore, whither Antichrist should reigne for e∣uer, and whither God would at any time vtter his ryghtfull iudgement: And as I weyed these thinges with my selfe, I sawe the iudge of the whole world redye to take vengeance of ye reprobates &c. A. So also in this place Iohn setteth foorth vnto vs a certaine forme of Gods iudgement, least ye faithful myght be vtterly discouraged, whē they sée ye chyld of damna∣tion triumph for a tyme, & thēselues contrariwise to be tried with aduersities, bycause there shal folow a wonderful chāge of thinges anon after. And Lo, a whyte Cloude. S. He méeneth Christ the Conquerour king and iudge.Christes di∣uine maiestie. And it is a rise thing both in the psalmes and in the prophets, for the Lord to ride vppon the Cloudes in token of his souereine and altogither diuine maiestie. Therefore by this figuratiue spéech, Iohn setteth forth the diuine maiestie in Christ. Of which sort this is, Hereafter ye shall sée the sonne of man sitting on the right hand of power, and comming in the Cloudes of the aire. Mat. 26. f. 64. Also after Luke had said that Christ was taken vp in a Cloude frō the eyes of his disciples, immediatly he added ye record of his Angels, This Iesus which is takē vp from you into heauen shall come in the same wise that you haue seene him go vp into heauē. Act. 1. b. 9.11. Like the sonne of man. Iohn speaketh thus,Chrystes manhoode. bicause that wheras Christ séemeth outward∣ly to be but man, yet notwithstanding in power he is God. Furthermore whome a little erst he had set out like a Lamb, by reason of the resemblance of his being offered in sacrifise:
him maketh he now a man, in respect of the misterie of his incarnation. A. So also Paule sayeth of the same Christ: who being in the shape of God, thought it no robberie to be equall with God. Neuerthelesse he abaced himselfe, taking vppon him the shape of a seruant, and became like vnto men, and was found in his behauiour as a man. Phil. 2. a. 8. Hauing on his head a Crowne of gold. S.Christs king∣ly maiestie. A Crowne of Gold is a token of kingly maiestie, and also of victory. A. When Christ was vp∣pon earth, he ware a Crowne of thorne that was put vppon his head, that he might by and by after reconcile his father vnto vs by his death: And now being in glory and singular felicitie, he is crowned with glory and honor. Hebr. 2. c. 9. Which thing Iohn meant to betoken by the resemblance of a crowne of golde. And in his hand a sharp Syth. G. The sharpe Syth in Christs hand,The cutting vp of the wic∣ked. betokeneth the sorenesse of his iudge∣ment to come. S. For it appeereth wel ynough by Esa. 18. b. 5. & by Ioel. 3. d. 10. that vnder this image, heere is described the person of a iudge that is ready to giue the sentence of cutting vp. Yea and our Sauioure himselfe according to Iohn Bap∣tist, compareth his iudgemēt vnto a haruest. Mat. 3. c. 12. & 13. e. 39. Also by the name of Syth, may be betokened the word of God, for by the worde shall the wicked be iudged, as Christe himselfe witnesseth, saying: The worde that I haue spoken shall iudge him in the latter day. Iohn. 12. g. 48. 15. And another Angell vvent out of the Temple, crying vvith a loude voyce to him that sate vppon the Cloude: Put foorth thy Syth and mowe: for the houre, is come that thou shouldest movv, bycause the haruest of the earth is ripe. And another Angell went. A. Nowe Iohn describeth the execution of Gods iudgemente, vnder the two simili∣tudes of haruest and Grapegathering. Put foorth thy Syth, and mow S.G. By this place (like as by other, as well in
this booke as in other partes of Scripture) it appéereth with with what affection & with what diligence those heauenly spirites desire to further the welfare of such as beléeue in our sauiour Christ.The desirous∣nesse of the Angels to fur¦ther the wel∣fare of the godlie. Herevpon the Angell is brought in as it were making earnest sute to haue the time of persecutiō shortened yt the wicked might not any longer blaspheme God, & worke outrage ageinst his chosen. In respect wherof the Angels are termed Haruest folke & brought in as haruest folke by Christ himselfe. Mat. 13. c. 39. Howbeit there bée some that refer this to the ministers of the Church, which cry vnto God for the de∣liuerance of the godly and the punishment of the vngodly. Bi∣cause the haruest of the earth is rype.The harueste of the world. A. This haruest is the ve∣rie same that Christ willeth to bée taryed for, when he trea∣teth of the sholing out of the good from the bad. Suffer ye thē (saith he) too grow togither vntill Haruest, and when haruest commeth, I wyll say too the Haruest folke, first gather yee to∣gither the darnell and bynd it vp in bundles to bée burnt: but gather yée the wheate togither into my berne. Math. 13. d. 30. 16. And he that sat on the Cloud dyd put his sythe vnto the earth and the earth, vvas movven. A. The same thing doth Christ shew plainly, howbeit in other words. Mat. 13. f. 41. and 25. c. 31.32. The sainctes are iudges of the world.17. And another Angell came oute of the Temple vvhich is in heauen, hauing also a sharpe shredding∣hooke. M. Iohn hauing spoken of Christes iudiciall power, procéedeth consequently to the power of the sainctes ye assist Christ in that iudgement. For in as much as Christ and they bée made all one: they are also called iudges of the worlde too come. Math. 19. d. 28. &. 1. Cor. 6. a. 2. And therfore this Angel is brought in with a sharpe shredding hooke, to execute the last iudgement togither with the sonne of man.
18. And another Angell came out from the Altar, vvho had povver ouer fyre, and he cried vvith a lovvd voyce vnto him that had the sharpe Shredding hooke, saying: put foorth thy sharpe Shredding hooke and cut dovvne theSome reade the clusters of the vine of the earth. clusters of the earth, for hir grapes bee ripe. And another Angell came out. &c. G. Some thinke that by this Angel is betokened Christe,The surceas∣syng of Chri∣stes intercessi∣on, and his ex∣ecuting of the last iudgemēt. who is said to go out of the Altar, when he surceasseth his office of mediatorship, & inter∣cessorship: which thing shall come to passe at the day of iudge∣ment. For thē shal ye chozē be rewarded with the euerlasting blisse & endlesse life which they haue always waited for, and there shal be no need of intercessiō any more. For ye Sainctes shal sée God face to face, as it is writtē. 1. Cor. 13. d. 12. &. 1. Ioh. 3. a. 2. And whe s it followeth. VVhich had power ouer fire: they expounde i to be meant of the same Christ: saying, that by the name of se, there is betokened most gréeuous & hor∣rible vengeance, and that the same is in the hand of Christe, whome God the father hath ordeined iudge of the quicke and the dead. Act. 10 g. 42. Which exposition agréeth best to the te∣stimonie of the scripture. For it is certaine that nothing shall be done in that last iudgemente, but by the will and appoint∣ment of that souereigne iudge whome God the father hathe ordeined. Put foorth thy sharpe Shredding hooke. A. It is an ex∣hortation or rather a commaundement for the executing of the last iudgement. And cut down the clusters of the earth. S.The vtter rooting vp of Antichristes kingdom, and of all the vn∣godlie. By the two similitudes of haruest and grape gathering, Iohn set∣teth before our eyes the vtter rooting vp of Antichrists king∣dome, or rather of al the vngodly. Which similitudes are rife in the Prophets when they speake of the iudgement of Gods wrath against sinners. For people are likened to Corne and Vynes. Therefore as oft as they be consumed for their sinnes by sword, fami or pestilence, they be said to be mowen, rea∣ped, and cut downe. Then by haruest and grapegathering,
héere is ment all one thing: that is to wit, the damning of the wicked. Howbeit by the Vyneyard we haue a more determi∣nate pointing out of such as worke euill with greater inde∣uer: like as a vyneyard requyreth greater businesse to make it frutefull, than other land doth. For asmuch then as Anti∣christ is the worst of all men: He is aptly betokened in this place by the vyne: and by the clusters therof, it is not amisse to vnderstand his princes, priuypackers, Heretikes, and the rest of his fauorers.Antichrist li∣kened to a vine, and his ministers to the grapes. For hir grapes be rype. S. That is to saye, their wickednesse is come to his full growthe, their iniquitie is gotten to his full heighth, their sinnes are full sommed: ac∣cording as the scripture sayth of the Amorrhyts Gen. 15. c. 16. And Christ méening to betoken the same thing, sayd to the Scribes and Pharisies: Fill yée vp the measure of your fa∣thers. Mat. 23. d. 32. For asmuch then as the things that Gods holie prophets haue spoken of Antichrists kingdome, are ful∣filled: it is ryghtly sayd, that his grapes be rype. Also Anti∣christ himself is very fitly termed a vyne, and his princes and Apostles, the clusters of grapes. For like as the sap that pas∣seth out of the vyne and is rypened in the grapes, hath po∣wer aboue all other licours to make men drunken: So Anti∣christ and his princes by reason of their great authoritie in the Churche, and their greate abundance of riches, and his Apostles by reason of their counterfet holinesse, haue most effectuall power to turne away men from the truthe of the Gospell, in somuche as many be so far ouersotted with that drunken dotage, that they think the law of the Gospell to be vtterly vnnecessarie and worthie aboue all other lawes, (as reason would it should haue bin) and not rather fond & foolish: all caces shoulde haue bin decyded by it, rather than by any other lawe whatsoeuer: The flat contrarie wherof ye whole world witnesseth to be done.
19. And the Angell thrusted his sharpe Shredding hooke into the earthe, and shreaded [of the grapes of] the vyneyard of the earth, and cast them into the great vvynefat of Gods vvrath. And the Angell thrusted &c.The vtter damnation of Antichryste, & of all the, wic∣ked. All things are at the commaun∣dement of the iudge Christe, bycause all power is giuen hym by God the father, that he should render reward to the good, and lay extreme punishment vppon the bad. And shreaded of the grapes of the vyneyard of the earth. That is to say, he sholed out the bad from the good.Hell. And cast them into the great wynefat of Gods wrath. A. Iohn méeneth Hell or the place where the damned sort be: which is tearmed yt winefat of Gods wrath, bycause the wicked shall finde nothing there but Gods dread∣full wrath: in respect whereof it is sayd, he that beléeueth not the sonne, shall not sée life, but the wrath of God abideth vpon him. Iohn. 3. d. 36. M. This winefat of hell is called Great,Why hell is sayd to bee great. by∣cause the mouth of it swalloweth vp all men at the Diuels pleasure, and bycause it receiueth many, euen princes and kings, A. By reason wherof it is also said to haue widened the mouth of it. Esay. 5. d. 14. M. And lastly bycause the peyne of it is endlesse. S. Iohn therfore hath tearmed the vnmeasurable rage and most déepe sea of sorrowes and tormentes, from whence no man can swim out or by any meanes wade out, the great winefat of Gods wrath: like as it is euidently she∣wed in the similitude of the rich glutton. Luk. 16. f. 26. A.A good ex∣hortation. Then let vs learne in season to shunne this great wrath, that we be not compelled to féele the greatnesse of it with the vngodly. Let vs humbly say vnto God, turne away thy wrath from vs, Psal. 85. a. 4. And séeing that Christe sitteth now vpon the throne of mercie, and calleth all men to amēdment: we must beware that we abuse not his graciousnesse, nor despise not his mercie, as though it could stand vs in no sted, vpon trust of our owne workes. But rather let vs go wyth faythe too the throne of grace, that wee may obtayne mercye, and
fynd fauour to be helped in due season. Hebr. 4. d. 16. For Lo, now is the tyme of accepting into fauour, now is the day of Saluation. 2. Cor. 6. a. 2. But then shal be the time of punish∣ment & the day of vengeance, howbeit vnto those only which haue despyzed the tyme of Saluation and grace through fro∣ward vnthankfulnesse. 20. And the vvinefat was troden vvithout the citie: And blud vvent out of the vvinefat vp to the brydles of the horses, by the space of a thousande and six hun∣dred furlongs. And the wynefat was troden. S. He procéedeth with his simi∣litude of grapegatherers & treaders of the wynefat. Esa. 63. a. 3. without the Citie.The separa∣tion of the wicked from the godlie. That is to wit of the heauenly Ierusa∣lem for the damned sort are put out of the companie of all the Citizens of the kingdome of heauen, A. according as Christe gaue to vnderstand when he sayd of the fishers, They haue chozen the good fishes into their owne vessells, and cast the noughtie ones out of dores: so shall it be in the knitting vp of the world, &c. Math. 13. f. 48.49. And also when he treateth of the outward darknesse, in the same Euangelist. 8. b. 12. P. In vayne then and ouerlate is the repētance of the damned sort, bycause they shall neuer be so cléere purged of their sinnes, as that they may be ioyned in cōpanie with the godly: but they shall be asunder for euer according as Christ hath shewed in the person of Abraham. Luke. 16. e. 26. And blud went out of the winefat. By the name of blud, the scripture is wont to be∣token vengeance and reuengement: and so meant Iohn to de∣scribe the greatnesse of Gods wrath after a sort in this place.A good exhor∣tation. Vp to the horses bridles. His méening is, that the infinite mul∣titude of Antichrists host, shall perish farre and wide through all the foure quarters of the world: which thing seemeth to be betokened by the number of the furlongs. For foure times foure hundred make a thousand and sixe hundred: so that, as well in respecte of the multitude that perish, as in respect of
in respect of the greuousnesse of the paynes, a man may vn∣derstand it to be a greater slaughter than that whiche Christ foretold to be to come vppon the Iewes. All the rightuous bloud (sayeth he) which hathe bin shed vppon the earth from the blud of the ryghtuouse Abel, vnto the blud of Zacharie that was slayne betwéene the Temple & the Alter, shal come vppon you. Math. 23. d. 35. &. Luke. 19. f. 43. For these compari∣sons and similititudes are surmounting, which Iohn vseth, to set out the greatnesse of the matter. M. For all this is spo∣ken to set out the horriblenesse of euerlasting damnation, for like as it were a horrible matter, to sée a man ryding in blud vp to the horses brydle, by the space of a thousand and six hun∣dred furlongs togither: euen so, much more horrible shall the punishment be, which the damned sort shall indure dayly in Hell. The fifteenth Chapter. ANd I sawe another signe in heauen, great and mar∣uelouse, seuen Angelles hauing the seuen last pla∣gues for in them is the wrath of God fulfilled. ANd I sawe another signe in heauen. A.The contents of this chap∣ter. Iohn she∣weth in this chapter, how such as haue not bin misled by the frowarde doctrine of Antichrist, doo yéeld God thanks for it, and allure all other creatures to the setting forth of the prayzes of the same God. Also he sheweth how the Lord God sendeth his messengers, as well for the perfect deliuerance of his seruāts, as for the vtter destruction of the reprobates.A wonder. Great and won∣derful. Iohn hath added this, to make his héerers giue the bet∣ter eare to him. And yet for all that, it is a great and wonder∣full signe or miracle, when the houge Antichrists are van∣quished and put to flyght by mē of the bacest sort, through the
power of Gods word. For thus was it sayd of the beast: who is like the beast, and who is able to feight with him? Héerto∣fore. 13. b 4. Seuen Angelles. M. That is to say, All preachers furnished with sundry gifts, & inlightened with ye grace of the holy Ghost,As Antichrist crept vp by little & little, so must he be a∣bolished by little and little against Antichrist. Hauing the seuen last plagues. S. By this place it appéereth, that this vision belongeth to the last persecution that Antichrist shall make, whiche shal not last so smal a time as some haue thought, yt is to wit, but three vsuall yeeres & a halfe: as it is euident to him yt cōsidereth the beginning, increase, and end, both of Mahumet & of the bishop of Rome. For they started not vp to so great power vpon the sodein, neyther shall they bee bereft ageine of their kingdome vpon ye sodein, no not euen when they be throughly knowen. A. In Paules tyme the chyld of perdition began euen then to worke ye misterie of iniqitie. 2. The. 2. b. 7. Neither could he be knowē out of hād: but assone as God thought it good to in∣lighten ye world anew with ye Lamp of his Gospel: then was Antichrist discouered & made knowē, who heretofore had bin reuerenced of all men as cheefe shepherd of the Church, or ra∣ther honored as Lord of the whole world. Yet ceaseth he not to rage still, but stryueth with myght and mayne to hold still his vsurped tyrannye, cursing and banning euery man that assayeth to shake off his yoke. For in them is the wrath of God fulfilled.Plgues are the executions o gods iud∣gements. It is a rendering of a cause. For hée sheweth where∣fore God called out those seuen last plagues: namely for the fulfilling of Gods wrath in them, by the slaughter of Anti∣christ and all his armye. G. Daniel hath told vs aforehand, that Antichriste shall deale as hee listeth himselfe, and exalte and magnifye himselfe aboue all Gods, and speake maruel∣lous thynges against the highest God: and that he shall haue fortunate lucke in his doings, vntill Gods wrath be fulfilled at suche time as his wickednesse is come to his full perfect∣nesse. Daniel. 11. f. 36. The same thing doth Iohn séeme to be∣token. S. And by seauen plagues hee meeneth all manner of plagues wherwith God is wont to destroy the wicked, after
the manner of the scripture: lyke as Moses saythe, And I will smite you with seauen plagues. Leuit. 26. e. 28. And the holy stories of the Byble report such manner of plagues to be oftentimes wrought by the seruis of Angels, as vpō Sodom, Gen. 19. a. 1. and in the red Sea, Exod. 14. e. 19. and vpon Sen∣nacherib. 4. Kings. 19. g. 35. & Esay. 37. g. 36. and in other pla∣ces very rife: howbeit that oftentimes he vseth the seruis of men, as well good as bad, to the same purpose, according as he thinketh good. 2. And I savve as it vvere a Sea of glasse mixt vvith fire: and them vvhich had gotten the vpper hand of the beast and of his Image, and of his marke, and of the number of his name, standing vpon the sea, vvith the harps of God in their hands. And I sawe as it were. M. Before Iohn go in hand to declare the saide plagues, he describeth Christes armye liuing and teaching according to the Gospell, thereby to giue men too vnderstand, what manner a one he ought to be, which wil be admitted into their company. A sea of glasse. S.G Of the Sea of glasse I haue spoken héeretofore. 4. b. 6. Mixt with fyre.The afflicti∣ons of the god he do purge them. The Sea of glasse mixt wyth fyre, séemeth in this place to beare a resemblaunce of the greate myseries and afflictions whiche the godly suffer at the handes of Antichrists souldiers, wher∣by the drosse of their fleshly afectiōs being skowred off by the working of Christes spirite, and as it were fyned like goe in the fyre, is at length made perfectly cleane: according too this texte, we haue passed through fyre and water, and thou hast brought vs out into coolenesse againe. Psalm. 66. c. 11. Wherevnto Baptim also calleth vs: according as Paule teacheth, Roma. 6. a. 4. &. 1. Cor. 10. a. 2. & Colos. 2. c. 12. &. 3. a. 5. &. 1. Peter. 3. d. 21. And Iohn hathe alluded to the passing of the red Sea, Exodus. 14. e. 22. And them whiche had gotten the
vpper hād of the beast. &c.Who they be that ouercome Antichriste, & syng praises vnto God. These are such as haue not had An∣tichrists outward Religion so much in estimation, nor bin so much perswaded by his deceitfull miracles, as to giue credite to his wickednesse rather than to the religion of Christe. These kinde of people did Iohn sée standing vppon the sea of glasse, with the harpes of God in their hands. That is to say yéel∣ding thanks vnto God, and magnifying him with continuall prayses. For they know, that this victory of theirs is gotten, not by the power of man, but by the power of Christ: who is wont to kéepe suche folke very well from the deceites and falsehoodes of men, as he hath taken charge of to kéepe, that they may not perish with the rest of the worlde whiche is set wholly vpon mischéefe. 3. And they sung the song of Moses the seruaunte of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: Great and vvonderfull are thy vvorks, O Lorde God almightie: rightuous and true are thy vvayes O king of the Sainctes. And they sung the song of Moses. S. By this place it appée∣reth, that in the sea of glasse, Iohn (as I said euen now) allu∣deth to the passing of the red sea, where the Israelites were by a resemblance baptised, according as the Apostle witnes∣seth. 1. Cor. 10. a. 2. Therefore it is all one as if Iohn shuld say, Like as in old time the auncient people of God hauing passed the red sea where their enimies were drowned, walked safe vpon the shore, singing a song of victory to the Lorde their Sauiour: So now also, these hauing vtterly ouercome al po∣wers yt stood against thē, do praise and magnifye their Saui∣oure Christ with earnest mindes.Why Magi∣strates and ministers bee clled Gods seruauntes. And Moses is called the seruant of God, not onely bicause he worshipped the Lorde aright, but also in respecte of the seruis that hée was charged wyth, lyke as the Prophets, Apostles, and ministers of Gods worde are called Gods seruantes, too the ende
that men should know with whom they haue to deale, when the Lordes message is brought vntoo them by the ministerie of his seruauntes. In respect whereof Paule saith thus: He therefore that despyseth these things, despiseth not men but God who hath put his spirite intoo vs. C. Whereby he conclu∣deth, that whosoeuer reiecteth the doctrine of the Gospell, re∣iecteth not men but God: B. least any man picking a quarrell myght say, what haue I to doo wyth the preceptes of the A∣postles? who is Paule, or who is Peter? were they not mor∣tall and miserable men? But Paule answereth them thus. As for ye things that wée alledge ageynst sin, wée make them not of our selues, but wée take them out of Gods word. L. And therfore they that despise them, despyse not vs that warneth them, but they despise God the authour of them, by whose au∣thoritie and commaundement wée speake them. C. The cause why the Apostle steppeth vp so vehemently ageinst them, is for that there bée euer some crabbed persons, who forasmuch as they are carelesse of God, do scoffe at all the threatnings of his iudgement, and there withall doo make a mocke of all the preceptes of holie and godly lyfe. Suche folke must not bee taught, but they must be beaten with chyding as it were with the stroke of a hammer. I. The like sentences hath Christ al∣so. He that héereth you héereth mée, and he that despiseth you despiseth mée, Luke. 10. c. 16. Also, whose sinnes soeuer you re∣lease they bée released: and whose sinnes soeuer you wyth∣hold they be withhild. Iohn. 20. e. 23. The foresaid song of Mo∣ses is written in Deut. 18. d. 18. And the song of the Lambe. I haue told yée often heretofore, and specially in the third verse of the eight chapter how there can no acceptable honour bée yéelded vntoo God, excepte Chryst the mediator go wyth it. Great and wonderfull are thy workes. G.The ende of all thinges taughte by the scriptures. Whatsoeuer the scrip∣tures teache, it tendeth euer to this ende, that wée should ac∣knowledge God too bée great and wonderful in hys creatures, and declare the same vntoo others, but then specially when the benefite of redemption is in hand: that he alone may bée
feared & honored of all men.Gods almigh∣tinesse. Lord God almightie. S. The saincts doo chéefly commend Gods almightinesse, not so much in hys workes of creation, as most chéefly in gouerning thē, wherby he manifesteth his righteousnesse & truth in iudging ye world. And therfore they call al Nations through the whole world, to the fearing of him, & to the professing of his name. Ryghtu∣ous and true are thy wayes.Gods rightu∣ousnesse. A He that is ye chéefe rightuousnesse it self, cannot but do all things most rightuously. The lyke sentence welnéere, is had oftentimes in the Psalmes, and spe∣cially in the.God is a king to the Sainc∣tes & a iudge to the repro∣bates. Psal. 25. b. 8. &. 119.151. O King of the Saincts. God in respect that he is the onely maker of all things, is king of the whole work, yea & is called Lord of heauen & earth. Gen. 14. d. 19. & Psalm. 24. a. 1. But forasmuch as he gouerneth hys children, whom he hath made holy by his spirit, after another maner than he doth the residue: he is truely and properly cal∣led the king of the Saincts and the God of the faithful, accor∣ding to the scripture which saithe, I will dwell in them and walke in thē, & I will be their God and they shal be my peo∣ple, Leui. 26. b. 11. &. 2. Cor. 6. d. 16. And Paule saith, Therefore are we in perill and suffer reproch, bicause we haue our hope settled in the liuing God, who is the preseruer of all men, but specially of those yt beléeue. 1. Tim. 4. c. 10. As for ye reprobates he is said properly to bée their iudge: for he will speake vnto them in his wrath, and trouble them in his sore displeasure. Psal. 2. b. 5. He will say like an angrie iudge, depart from me yée workers of iniquitie, Math. 7. d. 23. And also, Go ye cursed into euerlasting fire, which is prepared for the diuell and hys Angels, Math. 25. d. 41. 4. VVho shall not feare thee O Lord, and glorifie thy name? for thou only art pure: and therefore shall all Nations come and vvorship before thee, bicause thy iudgements are made manifest. The honou∣ring and glo∣rifying of god who onely is pure.VVho shall not feare thee O Lord. A. The feare of God, (like as in many other places) is takē héere for ye whole seruice of
God. M. q. d. Thou art worthy to be serued & honored of al mē. And glorifie thy name. M. That is to wit, both in déede & in doc∣trine. For thou only art pure. A. Only God is said to be pure or holy, bicause al creatures, in cōparison of him, are vncleane, yea euē the very starres, according as it is said in Iob 25. a. 5. And yet the Pope being a mortall mā, (that is to say but rot∣tennesse & wormes meate) wil néedes haue all mē to call him most holy, & so is he exalted aboue al yt is worshipped or cal∣led God. 2. Thess. 2. b. 4. And therfore shall all Nations come. &c. That is to say, Out of all Nations shall come some that shall professe ye catholike faith both in word & deede. Concerning ye calling of the Gentils, looke in the .ix. verse of the .vij. chapter heretofore, & in the sixth verse of the .xiiij. Bicause thy iudge∣ments bee made manifest. G. That is to wit,Fortune is the God of the wicked. to thy faithful chil∣dren, vpon whō the light of thy truth shineth. For although the vnbeleeuers haue experience of Gods iudgemēts in very déede: yet notwithstanding, so great is their blockishnesse, & so greate is the blindnesse of their minde, that whatsoeuer happeneth vnto them, they father it vpō fortune rather than vpon Gods prouidence. 5. And after this, I looked, & behold, the Temple of the Tabernacle of vvitnesse was opened in heauen. And after this, I. &c. In the enterance of this Chapter, he had begon to speake of the seuen Angels that haue the seuen vy∣oles, frō whence hauing made a step aside, to shew first ye ioy∣full things that he had seene of the sea of glasse and of the sing∣ing of the saincts: now he returneth ageine to his former talk that he had begon. The temple of the Tabernacle of witnesse was opened in heauen. O Concerning the opening of the temple, I haue spoken heretofore, 11. d. 19. S. And Iohn alludeth too the old Tabernacle, from whence answers were soughte in all af∣faires that were to be done among Gods people: which was a shadow of the things that were to be done in the kingdome of Christ Heb. 8. a. 2. &. 9 c. 11.
6. And the seuen Angells that haue the seuen pla∣gues vvent oute of the Temple, clad in linnen cleane and vvhite, and gyrded aboute their breastes vvith gol∣den girdles. And the seuen Angells. A. I haue tolde you alreadie in the first verse of this Chapter, that these seuen Angells betoken all the ministers of the Gospell, which are sent ouer all the world by God too abolishe the kingdome of Antichrist. That haue the seuen plagues.The sentence of Gods mi∣nisters is the sentence of God. M. That is too saye, all the plagues that are too bée layd vpon Antichrist and his ministers. VVent out of the Temple. This must bée marked aduysedly. S. That vn∣reuocable iudgement against wicked Antichrist and all those that bée linked wyth him in the same wickednesse, procéedeth out of the Temple of almightie God. A. Then is the iudgemēt which is pronounced ageinst the despyzers of Gods woorde, not the iudgement of man, but of God. Looke what the Mi∣nisters of his word doo bynd in earth, the same also is bounde in Heauen, Mat. 16. c. 19. &. 18. c. 18. and looke whose sinnes they withhold by the ministration of the word, they bée withhild. Iohn. 20. e. 23. In which respect Paule speaketh in this wyse of the power and authoritie committed to him by God. The weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but mightie in God, to cast downe strong holdes, wherewith wée ouerthrowe de∣uyses, & all highnesse, which is aduaunced ageinst the know∣ledge of God, and subdue all vnderstandyng, too the obedi∣ence of Chryst, and haue vengeance in a readinesse ageinst all disobedience. 2. Corin. 10. b. 5.6. Therefore there shall bée no scaping scotfrée for the despysers of Gods worde, whyche neyther relent at Gods promyses, nor are any what afrayd at the threatnyngs of hys Iustice,The shedfast∣nesse, purenes cherefulnesse, and stoutnesse of Gods mi∣nisters. but stubbornely wyth∣stand him when he speaketh by hys seruantes. Clad in linnen & white. M. That is to wit, decked with stedfastnesse of fayth, & now purged frō the sinnes which they had gottē afore. And girded about their brests with golden girdles. S. By these wordes
Iohn betokeneth their chéerfulnesse and stoutnesse in execu∣ting Gods commaundements: and secondly he sheweth, how that euen by this outward apparell, they proue themselues to bee messengers of the highest King & euerlasting iudge, whose commission they come too execute, so as euen the very ray∣ment of them may séeme to warrant victorie ageinst the vn∣godly. Looke for the rest concerning their cleane and whyte apparell and their golden girdles, heretofore. 1. c. 13. 7. And one of the foure beastes gaue vnto the seuen Angells seuen golden vyoles, ful of the vvrath of God, vvho liueth for euer and euer. And one of the foure beastes. For as much as whatsoeuer the Ministers of Gods word teach, they haue drawen it out of the foure Euangelistes as out of a well: some are of opinion that the foure Euangelistes are ment by the foure beastes. Some by this Beast doo vnderstand some Angell of the high∣er sort. And othersome wyll haue it too betoken the Churche, whyche assenteth too Gods iust iudgementes, and denoun∣ceth his wrath too all vnbeléeuers and despyzers of his word, Rom. 2 b. 8. But what Iohn meaneth by these foure beastes, I haue said heretofore, 4. b. 6. and 5. b. 6. Seuen golden vyoles.Golden vy∣oles. G. The vyoles are said to bée of gold, either in respect of the ex∣cellent doctrine which Christes Ministers doo preach: (for the woorde of the Lord is of all treasures the preciousest): or else bycause the Reprobates (who are called the vessells of Gods wrathe Rom. 9. e. 22.) are had in estimation after the iudge∣ment of the worlde. Neuerthelesse the doctrine of the Gos∣pell is vntoo the vngodly a certeine iudgement too damnati∣on, like as they themselues bée the vessells of reprobation be∣fore God.The prayers of the godlie are efectuall. Howbeit for as much as in the eight verse of the fifth Chapter wée reade of Vyoles or Sencers full of sweete odours or perfumes, whyche vyoles the Angell expoundeth there too bée the prayers of the Sainctes, whereas in this place they bée saide too bée full of Gods wrathe: wee maye
rightly say, that by them is betokened the continuall desire of the godly, who beeyng conformable too Gods wyll, doo euer∣more wishe that God shoulde mainteyne his owne glorie a∣geynst the wicked sorte which drawe it too themselues: ac∣cording too this texte, I will not giue my glorie too another, Esai. 42. b. 8. and. 48. b. 11. and that they themselues myght bée delyuered out of the handes of their persecuters, according as it is sayde, How long wilt thou bée angrie O Lord for euer? shall thy wrath burne as fyre? Helpe vs O God of our wel∣fare, for the glorie of thy name, and deliuer vs. &c. Psal. 79. b. 5. c. 9. Also, what a long whyle is it O Lord, which art ho∣lie and soothefast, that thou executest not iustice and reuen∣gest not oure bloud at the hande of them that dwell vpon the earth? Heretofore. 6. c. 10. Seing then that God is mindful of his promise, and cannot but herken to the prayers of ye rygh∣tuous: it followeth that theyr prayers prouoke God too take vengeance. Héerevpon the Vyoles are descrybed too bée full of Gods wrathe, for the Scripture witnesseth euery where, that the prayers of the godly are effectuall ageynst the vn∣godly. Psalm. 34. c. 17. and Iames. 5. d. 16. And héereof may E∣lias and Eliseus bée examples vntoo vs. 3. Kings. 17. a. 1. and 4. Kings. 2. d. 24. VVho liueth for euer and euer. A. This is ad∣ded too shewe the greatnesse of his wrath. q. d. Greatly is the displeasure of such a one to bée feared, who is able too damne a man for euer. 8. And the Temple vvas filled vvith smoke at the maiestie of God and at the povver therof: and no man vvas able to go into the temple, vntill the plagues of the seuen Angells vvere fulfilled. The dimnesse of mans owne wit and rea∣son, so as hee cannot attaine to Gods se∣cretes.And the Temple was filled with smoke. P. This smoke signi∣fyeth, that not all men can atteine too the secretes of Gods iudgementes: but rather that mens myndes doo dazle and quiuer at the considering of the plagues. At the Maiestie of God, and at the power therof. G. Truly Gods Maiestie is lyght∣some
and cléere in it self: but the smoke (that is too say ye dim∣nesse of mans mind) hindereth the sight of it. In respect wher∣of the Prophets are wont to say, yt the earth, or the house or ye temple are filled with smoke at the presence of Gods Maie∣stie. Exod. 19. c. 18. & Esai. 6. b. 4. &. 3. Kings. 8. a. 10.11. whereby they meane, yt the inhabiters of the earth were blinded. For the reprobates do in déede perceiue ye smoke: but they are not priuie of Gods secret presence. Like as in the troubles yt arise in these dayes for the Gospell, such mē as are voyd of the holy Ghost sée no more but a confuzed outward shewe of things: But the spiritual sort do al the while acknowledge there the presence of God, who ruleth all things, so as yée maye well perceyue that the wicked sorte cannot doo what they lyste a∣geynst the godly. And no man was able too go intoo the temple.No man vn∣derstandeth Gods secretes or misteries of his owne wit. C. That is to say, no man is able too atteyne to the perfect vn∣derstanding of Gods mysteries and iudgementes, vntyll the day of vengeance be come. For then wyll God lay open the couertes of darkenesse, and disclose the thoughtes of mennes hartes. 1. Corin. 4. a. 5. Too enter intoo the Temple, Taber∣nacle, or Sanctuarie, is taken now and then among the Pro∣phets, too import as much as too know the secret iudgements of God, or too bée indued wyth a large knowledge of Gods wyll, Psal. 73. c. 17. For in olde tyme when the people would aske counsell of God, they resorted too the Tabernacle, where answers were giuen, and Gods wil vttered. Also holy things were layd vp and after a sort hidden in a couert in the Sanc∣tuarie, so that it behoued men too repaire thyther to haue per∣ceyuerance of them. Hebre. 8. a. 1.2. and. 9. b. 5. Al which things dyd vnder types and figures, shadowe vntoo vs the things that were too be fulfilled in the reigne of Christe.The wicked neuer beleeue gods plagues till they feele them. Vntill the plagues of the seuen Angells were fulfilled. The wicked beléeue not the worde of God yt is tolde thē by his ministers, vntill ye threatnings which the word cōteineth be fulfilled. For then ye feeling of the punishmēt, makes thē to know ye thing which they were loth to know, & which they despised afore. And so (as
one saithe) payne openeth the eyes whyche offence shetteth. G.R. Yée haue an example hereof in the riche glutton, who sawe not Lazarus lying pitifully at his gate, so long as he himself fared sumptuously. But afterward when he was in tormentes, he could lift vp his eyes and both sée and knowe the same Lazarus though he were a great way of from him, that is to wit, sitting in Abrahams bosom. Luke. 16. The syxtenth Chapter. ANd I herd a great voyce out of the Temple, saying to the seuen Angels: go poure out the seuen vyoles of Gods vvrath vpon the earth. The contents of this chap∣ter.ANd I herde a great voyce. A. This Chapter she∣weth howe the vngodly wex more hard har∣ted and become worse and worse at Gods scourges, whereby they bée called too amend∣ment, vntill they bée quite consumed by his wrath: and contrariwise, that the faithful do yéelde God his due honour, and in all these things commend his ryghtfull Iustice. A great voyce oute of the Temple. He meaneth the commaundement of the great king, whose voyce maketh Heauen and earthe too quake.Gods wrathe for the despi∣sing of his go∣spell. Go poure out the se∣uen Vyoles of Gods wrathe vpon the Earthe. Nowe Iohn pro∣céedeth with that which he had begonne of the seuen vyoles in the last Chapter afore: all which things doo plenteously sha∣dow out Gods vengeance ageinst the despyzers of his word, lyke as it is certeyne, that suche mockers were punished at the preaching of Noe, Lot, & Elias. Is there any man yt séeth not, how that euen in this our time wherein we write these things, the wrathe of God rageth openly for the despyzing of hys Gospell by the worlde? yea euen the wycked are in∣forced too confesse it, and they dayly complayne of Gods wrath out of measure, Howbeit that they impute it not too
the despyzing of the Gospell (as truth is) but too the preaching of it. Moreouer the Ministers of Gods woorde are sayde too poure out the vyoles of Gods wrath vpon the earthe, when they foreshew and declare Gods iudgemēt by threatning the vngodly: as it is too bée séene in diuers Psalmes and in the prophets, yea and also in the Euangelistes. Math. 23. b. 13. and 24. c. 29. and Luke. 19. f. 42. and. 2. Pet. 2. a. 1. and. 3. c. 10. Wher∣vntoo also perteyneth that which Christe spake of the holie Ghost, A. when he commeth he shall rebuke the world of sin, and of righteousnesse, and of iudgemente. Iohn. 16. a. 8. And then doo they turne and amend, which are curable: and the o∣ther sort, according too the hardnesse of their hart which hath no skyll too repente, doo hoorde vp wrathe too themselues a∣geinst the day of iudgement, wherin Gods rightfull iustice shall be vttered. Rom. 2. a. 5. 2. And the first Angell vvent and poured out his Vy∣ole vpon the earth: and there fell a noysome and sore botch vpon the men that had the marke of the beast, & vpon them that vvorshipped his image. And the first Angell went. M. That is too saye,Gods venge∣ance vpon the despisers of his word. the Preacher (whatsoeuer he is whom Christe sendeth out ageinst Anti∣christ,) Poured out his Vyole vpon the earth. A. That is too say, preached Gods dreadful iustice according too Gods cōmande∣ment, ageinst the rebells, the wilfull sort and such as sauour onely of the earthe. And there fell a noysome and sore botche.The Frenche pockes. These plagues may be referred both to the body & the minde. Manie expound this first plague too bée either the pestilence which rageth more cruelly in these last days thā it did afore, or else too be that disease whiche they called at the first the di∣sease of Naples, wherewith the armie of Charles King of Fraunce was atteinted at their returne out of the kingdome of Naples: by reason wherof many men did afterwarde call it the French pockes: wyth which disease, not only the com∣mon people, but also manie of the Bishops, yea and of the
Princes and noble men also, were either pitifully arayed, or vtterly consumed. This disease (which was vtterly vn∣knowen afore) hath continued nowe almost fiftie yeeres. Héerevpon the Phisitians and surgions, haue deuised many medicines for the same disease, which haue in a manner de∣stroyed mo men, than they haue healed. And this disease con∣tinueth yet still to this day, sauing that as now it is accoun∣ted but as other ordinarie diseases. So also there spring vp dayly other straunge diseases, such as were neuer herd of a∣fore.The sweating sycknesse. Of which sort was the english swet, so tearmed bicause it crept first out of England in the yéere of our Lorde a thou∣sand fyue hundred and thirtie, whereof there died a greate number of people within those few days that it continued in Germanye, in somuch as they were both whole and deade within four and twenty houres. And no doubt but ther be yet far worser diseases behind, by reason of the crueltie of Ty∣rants raging against the preaching of the Gospel, and also by reason that all kinde of wickednesse reigneth so excessiuely. G.Spirituall plagues. But if any man like to take this plage spiritually: then must it be saide that héere is nothing else betokened, sauing that dreadfull iudgement of God, whereof mention hath bin made in the opening of the first seale, and in the sounding of the first trumpet, for the which things looke before in the first verse of the sixth Chapter, and in the seuenth verse of the eighth Chapter. Sure it is a sore and noysome botch whē mē be giuen vp to a wicked mind, to do the things that are vn∣lawfull,The follo∣wers, main∣teyners and worshippers of Antichrist. as it is written to the Rom. 1.18.24. VVhich had the marke of the beast. M. That is to say of Antichrist, by folowing, professing, or mainteining him in any error of his. And vpon him that worshipped his Image. He meeneth the princes, whych fauor the error of Antichrists ministers, in whome the I∣mage of Antichrist shyneth foorth by conformablenesse vnto him, and by allowing his abuses.
3. And the second Angel poured out his vyole vpon the sea: and it became blud as it vvere of a dead man, & euery liuing creature dyed in the sea. And the second Angell, poured out. G.What is mēt by the earthe and the sea. Like as the earthe be∣tokeneth such as are giuen to earthly and fleshely things, and passe not at all for heauenly things: or also such as are simply conuersant vpon earth: Euen so the restlesse Sea, séemeth too betoken the chiefe estates of the world, or the confusion and chaungeablenesse of the world, or else those people that dwell farre of in out Iles, too whom the Gospell is come. And it be∣came bloud. M. That is too say, damnation was layd vpon thē for the bloud whych they haue shed. As of a deade man. By∣cause they shall not ryse ageyne from that death for as muche as it is euerlasting. And euery lyuing creature. S.Wherin men offend, therein are they pu∣nished. That is too say, al that consented vnto Antichrist in persecuting the faith∣full, are dead by finall damnation. Ryghtfully in good soothe are they made too drinke bloud, who thirst for giltlesse bloud and shed it as if it were but water, for so is their punishment answerable too theyr offence, lyke as after the same maner, Thomyris Quéene of Scythia chopt of the heade of Cyrus King of Persia, and casting it intoo a tub full of bloud, scor∣ned him, saying, Bloud thou hast thirsted, drinke thy fyll of bloud. 4. And the thirde Angell poured oute hys Vyole vpon the Ryuers and Springs of vvaters: and they be∣came bloud. And the thirde Angell. &c. M.The punishe∣ment of the corrupters of Gods holie worde. Héere are betokened proper∣ly the false Prophetes and priuie deceyuers, whyche are the Ministers of Antichryste: for whome there wayteth a lyke punishement as wente laste afore. For they trou∣ble the swéete and pleasante fountaynes of the Scriptures wyth theyr owne corrupte glozes, and preache their owne dreames to ye people in sted of Gods word. Besides this, they
also persecute the doctrine of the Gospell by all meanes, and set Princes hartes on fire to persecute the godly: like as it is too be seene at this daye, in thē that haue taken the degrée of maistership in the Popishe vniuersities. B. And this plague matcheth with the first plague of Egipt wherof wée reade in Exod. 7. d. 20. 5. And I herde the Angell of the vvaters say. S. The Sainctes are brought in, commending the righteous iudge∣mentes of God. Lord which art and wast. Looke the .xvij. verse of the eleuenth Chapter heretofore. Thou arte righteous and holie. This title is very often giuen vnto God, and specially when he punisheth wicked men. Bycause thou hast giuen these iudgementes. q. d. Vengeance hath bin put ouer vnto thée, and thou hast requited it: according as is added. 6. For they haue shed the bloud of thy Sainctes and Prophetes,Loke wherin men ofende, therin are they punished. and therefore hast thou giuen them bloud too drinke. M. That is too say, thou hast requited bloudshed with bloudshed. They haue prepared a pit, and are falne intoo it themselues. For they bee worthie. q. d. The punishment an∣swereth very fitly too the sin. They loued darkenesse better than light: and therfore doth darkenesse alwayes incompasse them, and they want the true light for euer. So Paule sayth: Therfore God wil send them strong illusions, that they may beleeue lyes, too the ende that all may bée iudged whyche haue not beléeued the truthe, but haue allowed vnrighteous∣nesse. 2. Thess. 2.11. 7. And I herd another out of the Sanctuarie, say∣ing yea Lord God almightie, thy iudgements be true and rightfull. Gods iudge∣mentes are most righful.And I herd another out of the Sanctuarie. A. Héere is shewed the mutuall consent among the preachers of the word, wher∣through they both acknowledge and confesse the iudgements
of God to be rightfull. Yea Lord God almightie. &c. B. q. d. Al∣though the whole world quarell against it, and although the wicked fynd fault and thinke themselues to bee punished without cause: yet is it most certaine, that thou doest nothing but that which is most rightfull. 8. And the fourth Angell povvred out hys vyole.The fire of conscience whiche folo∣weth the Po∣pish doctrine. A. Now followeth an other plage which the faithfull shepe∣herds giue warning of afore hand. Vpon the Sunne. M. That is to say vpon Antichrist who boasteth himselfe to be the day-sunne of the Church, saying that all men are enlightned by him, through his lawes and constitutions. And power was gy∣uen vnto him to vexe men with heate and with fire. G. This may be referred fitly to the torment of conscience whiche vexeth the Papists continually. For neuer can they haue a quiet conscience, which hang not vpon the word of God, but vppon the vaine constitutions and deuises of men. For it is onely God (who is also the only the lawgiuer) that can quiet our myndes by beléefe in Iesu Christe, according as Paule teacheth. Rom. 5. a. 1. 9. And men raged for the great heate,Some reade, They amended not. and blasphe∣med the name of God, vvho hathe povver ouer these plages: and they (*) repented not [their vvickednesse] that they might giue him glory. And men raged for the great heate. A.The fyre of consciēce whi∣che foloweth Papisticall doctrine. Those that séeke the causes of saluation by outward works, those that hold skorne of the word of the Gospel, and stād vpon the doctrines of mē, and to be short, those that imbrace the vaine Ceremonies of men for the lawfull seruing of God, cannot but be tormen∣ted with excéeding great heate of cōscience, bycause they find no manner of remedie or refreshing in al those things. They ranne, they siske héere and there, and like mad folkes they be doing with euery thing to the intent to shift for themselues: but all is to no purpose, bycause they turne not earnestly too the true God, but séeke to saue mischéefe with mischeefe, and
to driue away leasings with lies.Al the seruice of the papistes is but blasphe¦mie ageynst God. And blasphemed his name. B. Like as it is the maner of Gods children to sanctifye Gods name and to make much of it by all meanes possible: So the vnbeleeuers blaspheme God howsoeuer the world goth with them. S. Nay truly, so farre are they out of their wittes, that when they thinke to praise God, then do they cast out cursed blasphemies against him. For as for that counterfet seruis which the Papists say they yeeld vnto God, what else is it but horrible blasphemie against God and his sonne? And yet they tearme that seruis of theirs, holy and altogither diuine, in whiche the Sainctes deceased, are prayed vnto in sted of God, in which the honor that is due to God alone is conuey∣ed ouer vnto dumb creatures, in whiche Christ is denied to be the only Mediator, and finally in which the Diuel is wor∣shipped in sted of the liuing God. And vnder what pretence persecute they the holy Gospell, saue vnder colour of the zele of Gods glory? This is the same thing which Christ foretold his disciples of, saying: The time will come that who-soeuer killeth you shall séeme to do God high seruis. Iohn. 16. a. 2. VVho hath power ouer these plagues.The only re∣medie of pla∣gues is toseke attonemente with God. A. God is saide to bée the liuing God; for a difference betwene him and the Idols or false Gods. Moreouer he is saide to haue power ouer these plagues, bycause he only is able to turne them away. As of∣ten then as any manner of afflictions or troubles be sent, at∣tonement must be sought with God. Otherwise it is hard to kicke against the pricke.The Papists waxe worse by warning. And they repented not their wicked deedes. That is to say, They returned not to him that strake them (as the Prophet saith,) but they hardned more & more at his squorging: whereas the faithfull taking warning at their owne troubles, do by and by humble themselues vnto God, and craue pardon of their sinnes: as a man may sée in Dauid, Ezechias, and many others. 2. Sam. 12.13 &. 4. Kings. 20.19. &. Esay. 39. b. 8. M. Certes if the state and conditiō of the popish cleargie be weyed throughly ye excéeding great shame∣lesnesse of it will be apparant ynough and too much vnto
all men. For who is he among a number of them, that amē∣deth when he is warned? Truly, notwithstanding any mens finding of fault with them, they defende all their abuses still, and continue their manifest Simonie without shame. Nay verely, the more they be blamed, so muche the more stoutly defende they their errors, and increase them still from day too daye: in somuch as they thinke there is nothing whiche they may not do, if it be once taken vp of custome.The reproba∣tes charge god with vnindif∣ferencie and cruelnesse. That they myght giue him glory. B. That is to say, that they might acknowlege his iust iudgements, & séeke forgiuenesse of their misdoings. By this place we may learne, that God is bereft of his ho∣nor, when men disdaine to amende at his squorging, and too craue forgiuenesse at his hand. P. Therefore it is the manner of blasphemers that they had leuer to charge God with vnin∣differencie and cruelnesse, than to charge themselues with a∣ny wickednesse: and not only not to repent for plaging, but also to were hard, euen when they be squorged, as hath bin sayd already. 10. And the fifth Angell povvred out hys Vyole vpon the seate of the beast: and his kingdome became darke, and they gnevv theyr ovvne tungs for greefe. Vpon the seate of the beast. A.The defence of Antichrists seate, and the assaultyng of the same. The seate of the beast dothe properly betoken those that fauor Antichrist, or rather which are Antichrists thēselues, of which sort be theyr Cardinals, Bishops, Officials, Commissaries, Somners, and such other like, whiche streine themselues to the vttermost to stay vp this Apostolike sea, that Antichrist may reigne there at hys ease. In the meane while also there wāt not stout assaulters of the same sea, who by ministring the worde of GOD, indeuer to draw men away from the worshipping of that ougly wight, that they may serue Christe alone, whiche thing is meant héere by the pouring out of the vyole vppon the seate of the Beast. And his kingdome became darke.
S.The troubled confusion dar∣kenee & mi∣serie of Anti∣christes king∣dome. It is well ynough knowen that the kingdome of Antichr aswell vnder the Pope as vnder Mahumet, is darke, voy all godly light & truth, & fraught full of all maner of ere and abhonimations: so as they be vtterly ignorant  eleeue of God, of true godlinesse, of the iustifying of the v∣godly, of the Sacramentes, of vertue and tyre, and finally of soule health. All things among them be vnterteine and  of philosophicall quiddities. Furthermore by the heaping ¦gither of the mischeeues which are foretold héere, he shall ∣ceiue his kingdome to bee pressed with so great myserie,  he shall bée vtterly at his wits end, not knowing which  to turne himselfe. His kingdome then shall bée troubled he shall bestir himselfe, yea and become starke made but all shall bee in vaine: according too that which the wisedome of God threateneth to such as despise him, Prou. 1. d. 31. at what  all the gloriousnesse and power of Antichrists kingdome shall pershe togither. A Wo are they therfore which liue vnder  miserable and dark a kingdome. For lying, which slayeth the soule, lyketh them maruelously: and contrariwise the trueth maketh them sad at the harte, in likewise as light, which o∣therwise is amiable, is irksome too sore eyes. And what good can bee hoped for there, where nothing is too bee seene but con∣tempt of Gods woorde, defyling of the Sacramentes, and be∣nomming of the conscience? And they gnew their tungs for griefe.The punish∣ent or blas∣phemers. •. By this chaunge of speeche the scripture betok the rage of mynde for gréefe. And it is Gods iuste ¦mente, that they should gnawe theyr owne tungs,  wyth they haue spoken horrible blasphemies ageinst  and his seruauntes. 11. And they basphemed the God of heauen for s¦rvv and for paine of their sores, and [yet] they repe¦ted them not of their deedes. And they blasphemed. A He repeteth yt which he had sp alreadie in the nynth verse, namely, They blasphemed them
of God who hath power. &c. As if he should say.The blasphe∣mers of God & his word. They are so farre off from returning vnto him that strikes them for too giue him glory, (that is to wit, to acknowledge themselues to be sinners, and God to be righteous which layeth deserued punishment vpon them, and to pray him of his goodnesse too asswage the same) that they rush out greater reproches and blasphemies against God than they did afore. Not much vn∣like these, are they also which in these dayes do maliciously lay the blame of the miseries wherwith the world is distres∣sed, not vpon their owne sinnes and the despising of the Gos∣pell, but vpon God himselfe, as who would say, he deales a∣misse with men, when he sendeth his word among them, and allureth them by many meanes to repentance. But vppon suche blasphemies there will folow sore (howbeit rightful) vengeance. And yet they repented them not of their workes.The wicked waxe worse by warning. M. q. d. The more they be blamed and reproued, the more they defende their errors, and the mere they continue them and increase them from day to day. So saith Paule of them, that the euill men and the deceiuers shall wexe worse and worse, while they deceiue and are deceiued themselues. Whereby he doth vs to vnderstand, not only that they shall be wilfull stubborne, but also that they shall haue prosperous successe in doing harme and in corrupting others. For one naughtipack shall be able to do more in plucking downe, than ten faithfull teachers shall be able to do in building vp, labour they neuer so stoutly. Neither doth Satan cease at any time to sow dar∣nell and cockle to marre the cleane corne. Math. 13. c. 25. Nay rather when the false Prophets seeme to be put to flight, then do others bad vp out of them fresh and fresh. And their abili∣tie to do harme commeth not of themselues▪ as though vn∣truth were of it own nature strōger than truth,Why the wic¦ked haue so good successe in their wic∣kednesse. or as though the diuels slights were able to ouerwatch the effectuall po∣wer of Gods spirite: But bycause that men being of their owne accord already forwarde vnto vanitie and error, do much more easly imbrace the thing that agreeth with theyr
owne nature, and also bycause they be blinded by Gods iust vengeance, and therefore are haled as bondslaues at Satans pleasure. And this is ye chief cause why the plague of wycked doctrines is so workfull, euen bicause the vnthankfulnesse of mē doth so deserue. B. But let not the prosperitie and successe of the wicked offend any mā, or draw him into the felowship of their wickednesse. For their preuailing in euill dothe but further their owne vndoing: and the mo they draw after thē by their prosperitie, the more shall they bée punished for their seducing of them. C. And it stādeth the godly teachers in hand to bée warned hereof, too the ende they may prepare themsel∣ues too a continuall warfare, and not bée discoraged with the ouerlong continuance, nor yet yelde too the lewdnesse & pride of their enemies. 12. And the sixth Angell poured out his vyole vp∣pon the great Riuer of Euphrates: and the vvater ther∣of vvas dryed vp, too make vvaye for the Kings of the East. The calling of all nations to the truthe before the last iudgemēt day.And the sixth Angell. &c. A. Bycause Antichrist hath manye of the riche men and mightie men of this worlde that fauour him: it is requisite that Gods wrath should be denounced vn∣to them also, to the end they may learne to giue ouer the trus∣ting in their own riches, and to put their trust in God alone: like as Paule exhorteth. 1. Tim. 6. d. 17. Howbeit, in this place Iohn séemeth to giue an incling, that Antichristes kingdome shall receyue no small blowe, in as much as the preaching of the Gospell shall passe euen vnto some of the kingdomes that bee furthest off. For by that great Riuer Euphrates whose water is dryed vp, he meaneth that all things shall bée taken awaye whatsoeuer maye hynder the electe of the whole worlde from comming too the knowledge of the truthe. And therefore he addeth: Too make waye for the kings of the East. q. d. There shall bée no more let that maye kéepe backe the farre sette Nations, from héering the Gospell: but Christes
Kingdome shall bée spred out farre and néere, and Antichrists darke kingdome shall bée both diminished and quite made a∣way. 13. And I savve three vncleane spirites like frogges craule out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the mouth of the false Prophet. And I sawe. S. According to his ordinarie maner, Iohn ouer∣slipping the seuenth Angell, maketh a short rehersall frō the beginning, Three vnclene spirites. M. For the spirit of pride pro∣céedeth out of the mouth of the Dragon, bycause he is king o∣uer all the children of pride. The spirit of any maner of blas∣phemie procéedeth frō the mouth of Antichrist. And the spirit of lying procéedeth from the mouth of any false prophet.The manaces of tyrants are like the yeiling or croking of Frogges. Like frogs craule. B. He séemeth to allude to ye frogs that Pharaoes wizards brought forth by their witchcrafts. Exo. 8. b. 7. More ouer wheras a frog is but a silie weake vermin of it self: yet notwithstanding oftētimes it maketh a maruelous & horri∣ble noise with his mouth in so much if a mā were vnacquain∣ted with it, he would take it to be some terrible & very houge beast when he herd the voyce of it. And here vpon the Poets terming them according to their propertie, doo dyuerse times call them yelling froggs. Euen so also the manaces of Ty∣rantes are terrible in voyce onely, but in verye déede can doo no great hurt too the godly. Are not those talkatiue and loude sounding orators the Popes legatesThe Popes Legates. à latere like vnto frogs, which thunder out the puissance and force of armes of their high bishop, with stately & manacing words to kings & prin∣ces of the world, to the intent too moue them to some voyage of the holie Croysie (as they terme it) ageinst Heretikes, or else ageynste suche Kings as disobey the holie Churche of Rome? Of which sorte was Cardinall Iulian,Cardinall Iu∣lian cousyn in conditions to Iulian the apostata. who a few yeares ago stirred vppe the Emperoure Sigismund an the Princes of Germanie, too take the Croysie vpon thm
against the kingdome of Beame. Also they cease not in thys our time to tickle Emperours kings and princes (who other∣wise are méeke ynough of themselues) to make warre vpon the Lutherans, whome they abhorre as wickeddest of all mē. Againe, their sophisticall diuinesSophisticall diuines. be frogges also, who in their yelling disputations, crie out that the power of the Ro∣mish bishop, is the greatest of all powers, both in heauen, in earth,Friers prea∣chers. and vnder the earth. So are also those eloquent tale-bearers of theirs, whiche with loude voyces blaze abroade the holinesse and other notable vertues and wonderfull miracles of that most blissed syre in open Pulpit, to moue all men to obey him and reuerence him. M. Wherefore these thrée spirites that come out of the mouthes of the dragon, the beast, and the false Prophet,Here semeth to wante some whole sentence or principall matter in the la∣tine copie. are wel likened vnto frogges, for they lie crau∣ling in the puddle of their riches, and are prating and babling against the light of the Gospell, [about the which al the world is deuided] in thrée parts: whereof the Antichrist and his fa∣uorers make one part, the preachers of the Gospell, and the fauorers thereof make another parte, and the simple or dul∣headed sort whiche care for none of both the other, make the third part. Which thing the whole world knew not to be ful∣filled before the publishing of this prophesie so expounded. A. But it is well that the only voice of the Gospell is easly a∣ble to make such manner of frogges whist, haue they neuer so loude réeres and yelling voyces. For the truth is far stronger than lying.Sathan, the Pope, & Po∣pish teachers. Out of the mouth of the Dragon, the beast, and the false prophet. There be that thinke the Dragon the beast and the false prophet to be all one. But we may fitly vnderstand, by the dragon Satan himselfe the father of lies: by the beast Antichrist and all his body: and by the false Prophet all ma∣ner of false teachers of Antichrists kingdome.
14. For they be the spirites of diuels, vvorking mi∣racles, to go vnto the kings of the earth & of the whole vvorld, to gather them to battell in that great day of al∣mightie God. For they be the Spirites of diuells. M.Antichristes deceytfull mi∣nisters. Al these Antichrists and deceiuers are called Spirites of diuels, bycause they speake not but by the sending and mouing of diuels. For Satan hath his ministers, who taking vpon them the person of Christs Apostles, beare a countenance as though they were the my∣nisters of righteousnesse, when as notwithstanding in very deede they be false Apostles, guilefull, workmen, enimies of Christes crosse, and ministers of Satan:Lying mini∣sters. the ende of whome shall be according to their works. 2. Cor. 11. d. 15. VVorking mi∣racles. Euen lying miracles, as Sainct Paule saith. 2. Thess. 2. c. 9. Of which sorte were the miracles that were wrought by the dominike Fréers at Berna in Swisserland, and by a wench of Strawghsborowe, who made the men of that Citie (whiche otherwise were right suttle and aduised) to beléeue that she liued without sustenance of any bodily foode: and such other like things which are to be séene heretofore in the Chro∣nicles of times. A. Also suche hipocrites worke miracles that carie with them a very great shewe of holinesse: as it is to be séene in Monks and Nunnes, who though they purpose no∣thing else but the inlarging and mainteining of Antichrists kingdome, do notwithstanding seeme to deale on Christes behalfe, and to buzie themselues about none but such things as belong to the spirit of God, by reason whereof they easly catch the simple sort prisoners, and are esteemed holyer than all other men. To go vnto the kings of the earthe. M.Ghostly fa∣thers and cō∣fe sours to Princes. The spirit of Satan whiche dwelleth in them, is so effectuall in them, that they easly set the harts of kings and princes on fyre too hate the Gospell. S. And it is a wonder to see how greate force those petie Sainctes haue in bringing thys to passe, whiche heere the shriftes of kings and Queenes. Heerevppon the
Byshop of Rome of his owne méere motion without any sute made vnto him, is wont to aduance and inhonor them with no small spirituall promotions, to the end he may holde them bound vnto him by such benefytes, and by their mea∣nes be priuy to the secretes of the hartes of the puissantest kings.No mā ought to depend vp∣on multitude. And of the whole world. A. This percell sheweth that before Antichrists kingdome be abolished, it shal be spred far and wide: wherefore no man ought to hang vppon the iudge∣ment of multitude. Of which matter ye shall find more here∣after.Princes per∣secute Chryst to their owne destruction. Togather them togither. M. Namely againste the true preachers and louers of the Gospell, whiche cannot away with the horrible abuses and errors of Antichriste. But the fighting of the kings and princes of the earthe againste the Gospell is in vaine, A. bycause the world and the lust thereof passeth away. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 17. But the word of the Lord indu∣reth for euer. Esay. 40. b. 8. and 1. Pet. 1. d. 25. Besides this, al∣though they séeme to fyght but with their matches, or rather with far their inferiors: yet do they assaile ye very son of God in his worde, & go about to cast him downe from his throne, wherin his father hath placed him. And therfore very right∣ly, Why do the Gētiles kéepe a stir (saith he) and why do the people imagin vaine thinges? The kings and princes of the earth stoode vp, and laid their heads togither against ye Lorde and against his anointed. &c. But he that dwelleth in heauen shall laugh at them, and ye Lord shall laugh thē to skorn. Thē wil he speake vnto them in his wrath. &c. Psa. 2. a. 1. To their owne destruction then & not to the destructiō of the godly, do suche men of might make warre at the perswasion of Anti∣christs ministers. And therfore it foloweth. To battle in the great day of almighty God. For asmuch as the warre is made against God, both ye day and the victory are called the Lords. S. In the scriptur any day is called the great day of the Lord, wherein he vttereth his power by some greate and wonder∣full miracle, and maketh it manifest to the whole world that he onely is God, by deliuering the godly out of miserie, and
destroying the vngodly with horrible torments: of whyche sort the stories of the Bible report many, and the Prophets in diuers places auouch many. And it comforteth the godly wonderously, that al the kings of the world are able to do no∣thing against Christ. Which thing Iohn meant to betokē by the two titles of Great and Almightie.Why God is sayd to be gret and almighty. For the Lord is a great king ouer all the earth. Psa. 47 a. 2. The Lord is strong and mightie, the Lord is mightie in battel. Psa. 24. c 8. In respect wherof he is wont to be called the Lord of hosts. What king then dare come to hand strokes with him, & to promis him∣selfe victory? Also he is called Almightie, bycause that like as he hath created all things by his only worde: so he is able to bring any maner of powers ye stand against him, to nothing with his only becke. Therefore let no man be afraid of a bat∣tel of armed souldiers: but rather let him behold the almigh∣tinesse of our God, with the eyes of faith, and he shall see that mē be nothing else but a bubble and vanitie, with how great puissance soeuer they séeme to be armed. In respect whereof, depart ye (saith the Prophet) from man whose breath is in his nosethrils. For in what thing is he to be made account of? Esay. 2. d. 22. And Christ saithe, be not afraid of them that kill the body, &c. Math. 10. c. 28. 15. Beholde, I come as a theefe. Happie is hee that vvatcheth and keepeth his garmentes, least hee vvalke naked, and they see his shame. Behold I come as a theef. M.The sodayn∣nes of the cō∣ming of christ to iudgement. Iohn speakes now in the person of Christ, who likeneth his comming to a théefe: which thing the Apostles do also after his example 1. The. 5. a. 2. & 2. Pet. 3 b. 10. Howbeit in this respect, that he will come vpon the vn∣godly or euer they thinke any such thing. But ye godly watch, & by the signes which Christ hath foreshewed, they cōiecture that he is not far off, & therefore they frame their life in such wise to welcome him, as they be looking for him euery tur∣ning of a hād. A. But touchīg this matter looke in Ma. 24. c. 36.Watchful∣nesse. & so to ye end of ye chapter. &. 25. a. 13. & Lu. 12. e. 36. &. 21. g. 34.35.36. &. 1. The. 5. a. 4. Happy is he that watcheth. S. As wel christ as his Apostles
commend watchfulnesse vnto vs, to the end we may esches errors: least we might shake off the feare of the Lord, and the trust in God, and innocencie, and well doing towardes our neighbours, and so appéere naked and void of good works at the comming of the Lord. Wherevnto perteineth the simili∣tude of the ten Virgins propounded by Christ: The which he concludeth in this wise: watch ye therfore, for ye know not ye day nor the houre.Christs righ∣teousnesse. Mat. 25. a. 13. And keepeth his garments. M. By garments he méeneth purenesse and innocencie of life, yea & also Christes righteousnesse, which is made commō vnto vs by faith: according to the iudgement of the Apostle, saying: As many of you as are baptised in Christ, haue put on Christe. Gal. 3. d. 27. Happie is he then which hath put off the old man with his déedes,Whereof we ought to be a∣shamed, and wherof not. and betimes and earnestly put on the newe man whiche is made according vnto God, And they see hys shame. S. This shame betokeneth the leawd purposes and de∣uises of the heart, imagined as well against God as against our neighbour: which at that day shal be layd open to al men, as the Apostle witnesseth. 1. Cor. 4. a. 5. Wherefore they that be troubled in this world for Christes sake, neede not to be a∣shamed, bycause their reproch shall be turned into the grea∣test glory that can be. But contrariwise, those which cannot find in their harts to suffer any thing for Christes sake, least they might be had in derision in the sight of men, haue cause to be right sore afraid: bicause all the glory of this world shall be turned into extreme shame. 16. And hee gathered them togither into a place vvhich in Hebrue is called Armageddon. The common qurell of all tyrantes a∣geinst the Gospell.And he gathered them. &c. M. He speaketh of the Diuell the prince of darknes, who worketh in the stubborn harted chil∣dren. Ephe. 2. a. 2. and blinding the kings of this world, pric∣keth them forward to fyght against the Gospell, and leadeth them whither he listeth. VVhich in Hebrue is called Armaged∣don. In the scriptures, places take their names eyther of
some notable aduenture or by some notable mischaunce. As for example, the graues of luste, in Num. 11. g. 34. MI. Meriboth or The waters of stryfe, in Numb. 20. d. 24. and other like in the scriptures. So also dothe Armageddon by preuention in this place: which may be interpreted The army of wasting or Slaugh¦ter: representing euen by the vnluckie name of it, what shall befall at length to the army of Antichrist. Ierom (whom Au∣rigallus foloweth in his hebrew places) interpreteth Arma∣geddon to be a certain mountaine where the Israelites were wont to pitch their tents. Othersome think rather, that Ar∣mageddon should be called Gospelhil or the hil of glad tidings, or Applehill or the hill of choyce frutes. And truly the kings and princes of the earth haue none other quarrell to sight a∣gainst the Godly but only for Christes Gospel, whervnto all power ought to be subiect. 17. And the seuenth Angell povvred out his vyole into the ayre: and there vvent a greate voyce out of the Temple of heauen from the Throne, saying: it is done. And the seuenth Angel. M. Now Iohn descrybeth the finall dānation of the aduersarie powers and wicked féends,The bitter state of the diuels after Doomesday. which shalbe much bitterer after doomesday than it is now, for as∣much as they dwell yet still in the mistie ayre, according as it is sayd in the fourth verse of the second Chapter of the se∣cond Epistle of Sainct Peter. Powred out hys vyole. S.Our warfare is ageinst Sa¦than and his angels, & not ageinst men. Paule interpreteth this place aright where he sayth, we striue not againste flesh and bloud, but agaynste principalitie and a∣gaynste power, againste the Lordes of the world, the rulers of the darknesse of this world, against spirituall guiles in heauenly thynges. Ephesians. 6. b. 12. By whyche wordes hee sheweth, that Antichrist and his host are moued agaynste the godly by Satan: and there vppon, that in this incounter we haue not to deale with men whome we sée, but most of all euen with very Satan himselfe the prince of this worlde
and the God of this world,The powers or rulers of darknesse. whome we sée not. And the Diuels be tearmed by Christ, the powers of darknesse, and by Paul, the rulers of darknesse, bycause that by their lyes and de∣ceites, they leade men away vnwares, into sundry errors and most thicke darknesse, wherein they continue euermore without knowing the light of the truth. Wherefore the Apo∣stle calleth wicked and vngracious déedes, the workes of darknesse, that is to say, of not knowing God, or of them that know not God. Also he calleth the vnbeléeuers themselues, darknesse: Sometime (saith he) ye were darknesse &c. Ephe. 5. b. 8. A. Also, the light shyned in darknesse, and the darknesse comprehended it not. Iohn. 1. a. 5. S. Moreouer he calleth them ghostly or spirituall guiles in heauenly things, bycause they dwell in the darke aire to exercise men in the meane whyle, till they and the wicked be both togither dispatched into Hel, that is to saye,The sundrye names of hel. into a certayne place appoynted for the damned sorte, whyche place Christe is wont to call Gehen∣na, in Math. 5. d. 22. Luke the Euangelist, The bottomlesse deepe. 8. d. 31. Or Iohn heere, The bottomlesse pit, héeretofore 9. a. 1. and Sainct Peter Tartarum. 2. Peter. 2. a. 4. A. At whych tyme the iudge shall say to the Reprobates, hence ye cursed into euerlasting fyre prepared for the Diuell and his An∣gelles. Math. 25. d. 41. S. This seuenth Angell therefore brin∣geth tidings that the end of Satans reigne is at hand. It is done. M. That is to say, all the things are fully finished which were conteyned in the said seauen Vyols,The end of s the worlde s at hand. as it appéereth al∣ready by the manifest laying foorthe of them. Whereby there is playne warning gyuen that the ende of the worlde is now néere hande. S. Or else, it is done, that is to witte all aduersarie power is dispatched for a do, and the kingdome is confirmed vnto Christe and to God, according to that whiche hath bin prophesyed in the holy scriptures, and de∣termined from euerlasting. G. So in another place Iohn sayde, that in the dayes of the seauenth Angell, when hee begynneth too sownde his trumpet, Goddes mysterie
shal be fulfilled according as he hath foreshewed to his seruā∣tes the prophets. Héertofore. 10. c. 7. 18. And there folovved lyghtenings, and voyces, and thunderings, and there vvas made a greate earth∣quake, such as neuer vvas anye since there vvere men vppon the earth, so myghtie an earthquake and so greate. And ther folowed lyghtenings. &c. S.The dismay∣ing of the wic¦ked at Gods plagues, and speciallye at the day of iud∣gement. Such as knowe not God and so consequently trust not in him, are wont to be marue∣lously dismayd at such things. Like as we haue sene, how that when these things are a dooing, their wits be straught, their harts flitter, their visages looke pale, and their whole bodies tremble, knowing not whither to flée, or what counsell to take, but are at the next doore to despayre. Therfore what shall all the vngodlye doo, at such tyme as these things shall shewe themselues horrible aboue mānes estimation, such as neuer were erst since the world was made, when the whole frame of the world shalbe shaken in péeces, and perish by and by with all the vngodly? for which things sée Math. 24. c. 29.30.31. &. 2. Pet. 3. c. 12. Also looke in the. 16. verse of the. 6. Chap. héeretofore. Moreouer the maiestie of Christ when he appée∣reth as iudge, shall be more dreadfull to the wicked than all lyghtenings. Math. 25. c. 30.31. And the voyces and thunde∣rings are Christs verye owne voice, most dredful and horri∣ble, wherwith he shall slea the vngodly. Esa. 11. a. 4. &. 2. The. 2. b. 8. A. But if anye man like to refer these things to the last tymes of the preching of ye Gospell: thē must he seeke the ex∣position of the lightenings voices and great thundering, out of ye fifth verse of ye fourth Chapter, & out of the fifth verse of the eight Chapter of this Reuelation. And there was made a great earthquake. G. When the word of the Lord is preched,The gospell is comforta∣ble co the god∣lie, but dread∣full to the vn∣godlye. the godly take matter of singular comfort at it, but the vn∣godlye are wonderfully put in feare. Whereby it com∣meth to passe, that to the one sorte the voyce of the Gospell
is swéete and pleasant, and vnto the other sort it is like a ter∣rible earthquake. Concerning which matter looke vpon the fifth verse of the eighth Chapter heeretofore. 17. And the greate Citie vvas deuided into three parts, and the Cities of the Gentiles fell. And the greate Babylon came in remembrance before God, to giue hir the Cup of the vvine of his vvrath. A diuision of all people into three sortes.And the great Citie was diuided into three partes. G. By thys great Citie is meant the whole world, which at the cōming of the Gospell, is diuided chéefly into thrée parts. The firste part is of those that assault the doctrine of the Gospell with open force, such as Tyrants and persecuters of the Churche be, which shed much bloud for the Gospels sake, as wée haue seene now oftentimes. Another part is of them who being not able to resist the truthe, do winde themselues into the Lords flocke, and by counterfetting faith, do worke much in∣conuenience to the Church. Such are the Heretikes, false pro∣phets and Hipocrites, at whose handes the Churche hath al∣ways receiued great displeasure. The third and least part of all, is the godly, who both in purenesse of doctrine and holy∣nesse of life, professe Christ earnestly, but yet not without af∣flictiōs. For al they that will liue godlily in Christ Iesu must suffer persecution. 2. Tim. 3. c. 12. This is the godly and Chri∣stenly exposition of some men. Howbeit for asmuch as Iohn treateth héere, of ye vtter abolishing of Antchrists kingdome: it séemeth that as well by this diuision, as also by the thynges last spoken, he betokeneth that great alteration of the whole world and of all things in the same: like as when the Lorde came downe to Mount Synay to giue his lawe, the moun∣taynes are said to haue skipped lyke Rammes for feare: and like as in Zacharie when the Lorde shall stande vppon Mount Oliuet to fyght in defense of his Churche againste Antichrist, it is sayde that the hill shall be cliued asunder in the myddes. Zacharie. 14. a. 4. So also in this place
he declareth by a certaine propheticall manner of spéeche, that the great Citie (that is to say the whole world) shall bée diuided into thrée partes. And the Cities of the Gentiles fell.The vtter cō∣cting of all wickednesse before the lat∣ter day. That is to say all the strength and trust of the Gentiles pe∣rished wholly togither. And by the name of Gentiles, he mee) neth all kind of men which (after the manner of the heathen) haue forsakē the Religion of the one true God, and are falne away to fond and superstitious worshippings, after the in∣uentions of most vaine men. G. And then (that is to say before doomesday) all shall be conuinced of wickednesse and Idola∣trie by the word of the Lord, through the power whereof all things shall fall downe, séeme they neuer so high and loftie in the sight of men. Therfore that which Iohn speaketh in this place, is all one as if he should say, Although Antichrist and his impes haue the better ende of the staffe as yet, (who are rightly resembled by the Cities of the Gentiles wherin Ido∣latrie thriueth, for asmuch as they aboue all other men, bée giuen to couetousnesse which is a manifest seruing of Idols:) yet notwithstāding as fast as they be linked togither in one knot against the law of the Gospell, they shall at length bee ouercome and beaten downe by the preachers of the Gospel, and damned euerlastingly vppon conuiction of their wicked∣nesse and error. And the great Babylon. &c. G.Satans Ro∣mish route. By the name of Babylon he betokeneth Satans rout, and specially that rout which hangeth vpō the Church of Rome. For the chéefe seate of Antichrist is at Rome, where Simonies, Heresies and all kind of horrible wickednesse are put in vre and continued. S. This is that great Citie which liued most carelesse of all others by reason of hir welth and the greatnesse of hir po∣wer, and whiche thought it vtterly impossible that eer she should fall: and therevpon did rage at hir pleasure againste all the godly, in such wise as though God saw it not, or else woulde forget so wicked tyrannie. And therefore hee saythe she is come into remembrance: that is to witte, bycause hée taketh vengeance of hir wickednesse. Whereof
there redoundeth greate comfort to the godlye, when they héere that the wicked doings of the vngodly are writtē with a pen of steele, and a clawe of adamant, so as they may neuer be forgotten. Esai. 8. a.. 1. & Ierem. 17. a. 1. A. So Moyses saythe that the sinnes of the men of Sodom and Gomorrhe came vp into the syght of God, that is to wit that he myght punish thē. Gen. 18. c. 20. To giue hir the cup of the wyne of his wrath. The cup of Gods wrathfull indignatiō, betokeneth the vengeāce which the Lord wil execute against al the vngodly. Looke be∣fore in. 14. c. 10. 20. And all Ilands fled, and the mountaines vvere not found. And all Ilandes fled. S. This is sayd bycause the whole frame of the world shalbe so terribly shaken,There is no startinghole for the wicked to scape Gods vengeance. that euen the hyghest mountaines shall all of them clyue asunder and fall downe: and so shall the Ilands of the sea likewise sink and be swalo∣wed vp of the waues of the sea. And héereby he doth vs to vn∣derstand, how there is no startinghole for the wicked to scape out at, that they myght hyde themselues from the wrath of the liuing iudge. For whyle the world lasteth when anye bu∣skling to the warres is towards, or when any plage reigneth, ryche men and men of myght are wont to retyre themselues eyther to some farre outset Iles of the sea, or to some rough Rockes and stéepe mountaines. G. There be some, whiche by the Ilandes, vnderstand the Christen and true godly men, who being tossed with the stormes of tribulatiōs in this pre∣sente worlde, are notwithstanding saued by hope, so as they shall receyue no damnation with the wicked, where∣as Gods wrath shall be powred out vppon Antichrist and his disciples. But the former exposition agréeth better with the text.
21. And there fell a great hayle as it had bin Talents, out of heauen, vppon men, and the men blasphemed God, bicause of the plague of the hayle, for the stroake of it became exceeding great. And there fel a great hayle. A.The nauoy∣dable punish∣ment of the wicked. In these words he describeth the damnatiō of the reprobates, which he likeneth to haile. S. For like as a great haile striketh those very sore, that are abroade in the wether without any couert: euen so the sentence of the angrie iudge beateth all the vngodly in peeces at one stroke, and yet no man can withstand it or put in himselfe as a meane according to this texte, vppon whome soeuer that stone falleth it shall grinde him to pouder. Mat. 21. d. 44. And Iohn alludeth to the hayle of Egypt, or else to that whiche is written in Iosue. 10. c. 11. As it had bin Talents. M. q d. The ven∣geance is weyed and measured according to the quantitie of their offences. Out of heauen. That is to say, from Gods iust iudgement. Vppon men. That is too witte, whych despised Goddes lawe. And the men blasphemed God. S.The wicked waxe harder at Gods pu∣nishing. He inhaun∣ceth the wilfulnesse of the vngodly. q. d. The wicked sorte haue not glorifyed Christe (as it woulde haue become them too do) no not euen then when they had by most assured proofe had triall and experience of hys maiestie and inuin∣cible power by hys iustice: but wilfully hylde out still in theyr blasphemies. Whyche thyng hathe bin shewed in wicked Pharao, who hardened more and more from tyme too tyme at the squorges of GOD: so farre off was hee from yéeldyng too let goe Goddes people accor∣ding too Goddes commaundemente, vntill he was ouer∣whelmed with the waues of the red Sea and so perished as he pursued them. Exod. 14. g. 28.The terrible∣nesse of Gods vengeance. For the stroke of it became ex∣ceeding greate. A. The reprobates are euer in daunger of Gods vengeance, bycause his wrath cannot be eschued but by faythe in Iesu Chryste. Iohn. 3. d. 36. And there∣fore the stroake of the hayle is sayde too bée greate:
and there is ioyned with it, Exceeding. Iohn vseth a wonde∣rous augmentation in words. For firste he saide the hayle was great: next he saide it was as it had bin Talents: Then addeth he that it fell vpon men out of heauen. Afterwarde he tearmeth it a plague and a greate stroake: and at the last hée augmenteth great with exceeding. All which is done to shew that thing to be most true, whiche the Apostle saith in these words. It is a dreadfull thing to fall into the hands of the ly∣uing God. Hebr. 10. f. 31. The seuenteenth Chapter. AND there came one of the seuen Angells vvhich had the seauen Vyols, and spake vvith me, saying vnto me: Come, I vvill shevv thee the damnation of the great vvhore vvho sitteth vppon many vvaters. ANd there came. A. In this Chapter it is shewed, how the outward gloriousnesse of Antichrists kingdome shall be so greate,The contents of this chap∣ter. that the kings and princes of the worlde béeing allured there withall, shall be seduced wyth hys fro∣ward errors and deceites: from the whiche all those shall (notwithstanding) bée deliuered, whome God hath foreor∣deyned and forechosen too euerlasting life before the begin∣ning of the world. For asmuch then as héeretofore (14. d. 20. and 16. d. 19.) Iohn hath made mention of the greate Ci∣tie whyche is called Babylon: Now following the mysti∣call order whyche yée haue hearde of in the former thynges, hée describeth hir woorkmanlike, and (as they say) he peinteth hir out in hir colours.A preacher. One of the seauen An∣gelles. M. That is to saye, some one of the number of the preachers that are sente of GOD agaynste Antichriste.
VVhich had the seuen Vyoles. M. That is to say, all the plagues that were to be denounced ageinst Antichrist and his impes. And spake with mee. Iohn describeth all vnder a certeine re∣presentation of personages after the maner of the Prophets, too the intent they may be peceyued the easiyer. I will shewe thee the damnation. That is to say, the cause of the damnatiō,Spirituall whoredome. Of the great whore, That is to wit, of Antichrist. S. The scrip∣ture is wont to giue the name of whoredome vnto apostasie or falling away from God, (whom wée ought most intirely to trust vnto, whom it behooueth vs too loue aboue all things, in whom wée liue, moue & bée, Act. 17. f. 28.) too trifling things and vaine Idolls, which cannot helpe vs when wée be dry∣uen too our shiftes. For thus we reade: The children of Israel turned awaye, and went a whoring after Baal, and made a couenant with Baal, that he shoulde be their God, and they remembered not the Lorde their God which deliuered them out of the hande of all their enemies round eaboute them, Iudges. 8. g. 33.34. Also, howe is the faithfull Citie become a Harlot? Esai. 1. f. 21. Also thou wert layd downe like a har∣lot vnder euery trée that had thicke leaues. Iere. 2. d. 20. Also, thou hast playd the whore with many louers, Iere. 3. a. 1. Al∣so, thou hast multiplyed thy whoredomes, Ezech. 16. c. 26. Se∣ing thē that Iohn calleth hir héere a whore,Who be beto∣kened by the great whore. he séemeth chéef∣ly too blame the vnshamefastnesse and thanklessnesse of those which after they haue knowen the truth of the Gospell, after Christ hath bestowed so great benefites vpō them, after they haue boasted of the high estate whervnto he hath aduaunced them, not onely shrinke away from him, but also assault hym among the formest: so as wée may referre the greatnesse of the whore, not so much too the multitude of the backeslyders, as too their great vnshamefastnesse & vnthankfulnesse. Cer∣teine it is that this is referred too all the wicked of all sortes through the whole world: but yet chéefly vnto these whych vnder the name of Christes Vicar and of the souereine Apo∣stleship and such other styles, bestir them by all meanes pos∣sible,
too thrust Christ out of hys Churche. A. For who know∣eth not that Rome is fraught wyth vngodlinesse, Idolatrie, deceite, false teachers, yea and with Libertines, Epicures,Godlesse per∣sons. Atheistes, and all kinde of abhomination and horrible wyc∣kednesse? No man then ought too thinke it straunge, though Iohn chose rather to point out this sinke of all naughtinesse and more filthie than Sodom it self, by the name of Babilon, than to call hir by hir owne name. VVhich sitteth vpon many waters. S.What it is to sitte vppon waters. That is too saye, whiche reigneth ouer many king∣domes and Nations. G. For besides that the Bishop of Rome boasteth himself to bée head of al ye wersterne Church. M. Wée sée that the greatest part of Christendome hath hitherto fauo∣red him, and admitted his pestilent errors wythout any exa∣mination of them. G. And vntoo this place agréeth the simili∣tude of the waters. S. For lyke as ye waters of great streames doo eb and flowe: euen so one generation is no sooner gone, but another comes in the place of it. Also most commonly the godlyest are builded by riuers sides. 2. VVith vvhom the Kings of the earth haue com∣mitted vvhoredome, and they that dvvell vppon the earthe haue bin made drunken vvith the vvine of hir fornication. VVith whom the Kings of the earth. &c. P. He termeth their Kings of the earth,The fonde blyndnesse of earthly kings. which are puffed vp with earthly pryde, and sauour of nothing but earthly things. S. These (sayth he) haue committed whoredome with that great whore, in as much as they haue béen greatly delyghted with hir false Re∣ligion and miswoorshipping. For the fleshe lykes maruelous well of the outwarde and gay eye seruice, whereby he thin∣keth God too bée satisfyed, when in the meane whyle the heart remayneth full of vngodlynesse and all kynde of out∣rageous wickednesse. A. And thus the Hypocrites do so flat∣ter themselues, that the further they go away from God,
the holyer they take themselues too bée.Suche as Princes be, such are their people. And they that dwell vppon the earthe haue beene made drunken. If the Magi∣strates and Princes serue not God: hardly shall the people holde the ryght worshypping of God, for as much as the na∣ture of man is ouerforewarde too Idolatrie. Rightly there∣fore dothe Iohn adde immediatly, that the reste of the inha∣biters of earthe are caryed awaye and corrupted wyth the forwarde errours of Antichrist, as soone as the Kings haue forsaken the Religion of the onely one God, and falne too I∣dolatrie. VVith the wyne of hir fornication. S. q.d. The inhabi∣ters of the earth whyche sauour nothing but fleshe,Spirituall dronkennesse. haue béen delyghted wyth Antichristes false Religion as wyth excel∣lent good wyne, and haue quaffed of it tyll they were drun∣ken. A. For in sted of the diuine and heauenly wysedome, they haue lyked well of the earthly, beastly,Dronken do∣tages recey∣ued in Papi∣strie. and diuelishe wysedome, whereof Saincte Iames speaketh in his thyrde Chapter and fyftéenth verse. Was it not a great drunken∣nesse (trowe yée) when the whole worlde imbraced moste cursed abhominations wyth all gréedinesse, and that perad∣uenture not at suche a mannes hand as had wit too win them too it, but commonly at suche a one as was a drunkarde, a madbrayne, Ruffyan, a Lechour, a Rakehell, and (that I maye speake no filthyer thing by the waye) a proude per∣son? Besydes thys, the worlde receyued thyngs that are ageynste the manyfest textes of the Scripture: suche as the Masse is wyth hys appertnances, the worshypping of Sainctes and praying vntoo them, the sumptuousnesse of Images and the worshypping of them, the pompe of par∣dons, the suffrages for the deade, the vncleane and fil∣thye single lyfe, the despyzing of honest wedlocke, the diuorcementes of Lawfull Maryages, the choyse of mea∣tes, and the difference of dayes. Too bée briefe, whatso∣euer wycked Religion or Ceremonie he durste set afore vs, that haue wée swooped vppe whole too the bottome with great thirste and vehemente desire. Here vppon hathe
all kinde of heynous wickednesse ouerslowed into the world,God hathe iustly puni∣shed syn with synne. A. according as God is wont most iustly too punishe sin with sinne. Rom. 1. c. 24. S Herevpon grewe warres betwéene the Pope and Christen Princes for lighte causes, yea and often∣times for no cause at all, and so were murthers and slaugh∣ters committed vnpunished. Herevpō were whoredome and aduoutrie committed without regard of shame: and moreo∣uer rauishmentes, robberies, deceytfull vsuries, and breache of leagues and couenantes also. Finally, was there any kind of mischéefe which was not committed by these drunkards? A. Too the augmentation hereof came afterwarde, dulnesse of mynd and fond carelesnesse, contempt of Gods iudgementes & the neglecting of good lawes, togither with forgetfulnesse of Repētance. For whē mē began once too thinke they myght satisfie God with a fewe gewgawes, and that forgiuenesse of sinnes was become saleware: no mā imbraced the pure word of attonement with God. But burying the grace of Christes Mediatorship, euery man went about to purchace his peace with God by his owne workes.

And he caryed mee avvay in spirit into a vvilder∣nesse: And I savv a vvoman sitting vpon a rose colo∣red beast full of names of blasphemie, vvhich had se∣uen heades and tenne hornes. And he caryed mee away in spirit intoo a wildernesse. S. By the name of wildernesse,What is ment by wildernes. Iohn séemeth too meane such kingdoms and people as eyther haue openly reiected Christe, (as the folowers of Mahumet) or else as pretend the tytle of Christi∣anitie and of the Churche, wheras for all that, they be nothing lesse.Spiritual cō∣templation. M. Onlesse a man had leuer say, that Iohn being desirous to vnderstande the secretes of this prophesie, did as it were withdraw himselfe aside, and leauing the companie of men
pon earth, bend himselfe earnestly to spirituall contempla∣ō. For such mysteries are wont to bée disclosed, not to euery an, but to such as liue as it were in a wildernesse.The lordly∣nesse, pryde & ambition of the malignant churche. And I saw  woman sitting vpon a Rosecolored beast. S. It is well ynoughe nowen vnto suche as reade the Scriptures, that vnder the rmes of women and yong damsells, are betokened Cities: & lso that by the name of Citie, there is ment, no so muche the eople, as the partie that hath the rule of them. Seyng then hat ye cheefe thing which is treated of in this place, is Religi∣on: by the name of woman, wée must specially vnderstande hose that beare chéefe sway in the wicked Religion. And the Beast séemeth too bée such as are in office aboute the whore, which execute hir commaundementes, and whiche cary hir loft: of whom the Prophet speaketh, saying: And he shall worke very strongly with a straunge God, Daniel. 11. g. 39. G. This harlot then, or the Citie that is descrybed in this place, shall bée nothing else but the Lordship, Princelynesse, power, authoritie, pride, and ambition of the false and misbegotten Church, whither the same bée Rome, or the Church of Mahu∣met, whersoeuer it bée. Howbeit that in this place, doubtlesse the Romane Church is painted out truely and in hir lyuely colours (as the prouerb sayth.) Shée sitteth vpon a Beast:The beast that the Ro∣mishe strum∣pet sitteth vp∣pon. S. by which name are ment the Cardinalls, Byshops, Abbottes, Pryors, Munkes, Doctors, and Maisters of error, who ey∣ther by sworde, or by brybes, or by writing, doo further and mainteine the wickednesse of Papistrie in defending the su∣premacie of the Romishe Antichrist, and in vnderpropping that Apostatike seate, too the vttermost of their power, least it might fall through the forte of Gods worde. Rosecoloured.The blouddi∣nesse of the Romishe har∣lotte. M. That is to say, busied in shedding bloud, S. and all on a gore bloud with the bloud of Martyrs. For as well the whore hir selfe as the beast that she sittes vpon, doo thirst for the blud of the godly: and the Magistrate (or the secular power as they terme it) doo from time to time execute their desire. And so the wickednesse; as well of ye Pope as of Mahumet, mainteineth
it selfe by the sworde. Héerevpon the Byshop of Rome  craftely conueyed the Empyre, firste from the Gréekes to the Frenchmen, and afterwarde from the Frenchmen to the Germanes, whome the tryple crowned Minister sawe too bée of moste force in armes. P. This Rosecoloured Beat then, is al on a gore blud with wickednesse, and drunken wi corruptions as with blud, too the ende he may shew himsel too bée the imp of the red Dragon (that is too wit of Satan) who hath bin a manslear from the beginning. Iohn. 8. f. 44. Full of names of blasphemie.The blasphe∣mous titles of the bishops of Rome. A. Thys is most truely verefy of the Romishe Church, who acknowledgeth not God to be soothfast: but no lesse vyolently than presumptuously dr∣weth his due honour vntoo hirselfe. S. Are not these names of blasphemie, that is too wit, cheefe Byshop, most bli most holie, most mercifull father, Christes Vicar, the key bearer of Heauen, and Pope, that is too saye, the father of th Countrie? Ageine, what are these: most reuerend Car∣nals, Archbyshops, Archprelates, Patriarkes, Primates, Presidents, Deanes, Chanons, Archpréestes, Archdeacons, Abbottes, Pryors, or Sirres, or masters, & commendators. For like as Antichrist hath his names of blasphemie: euen  they which bée in office vnder him and are bound vnto  by othe, haue also names by themselues, which the scripturs know not of.Names of ser¦uice in the pri∣mitiue church In déede the primitiue Churche had Ministers, Stewardes, Elders, Ouerséers, Apostles, Prophetes, Eu∣gelistes, Shepeherdes, and Teachers. 1. Cor. 4. a. 1. &. 12 a 4.5.6.7.8. and Ephe. 4. b. 11. but all these were names of seruice and labour, and not styles of pryde. So héere wée also of thr dubble holy Sea,The double-holynesse of the Papistes. theyr dubble holie Canons, their  holie pardons: and too bée bréefe, whatsoeuer they themsel∣ues were in the meane whyle: all their things were term dubble holie. In respect whereof, (least a man might thin there were any péece of blasphemie or of pryde wanting i this Beast,) there was added for an ouerplus the w¦full. For sithe that Antichriste aduaunceth hymselfe
at that is called God or Gods power. 2. Thessa. 2. b. 4. can any man imagine anye greater wickednesse and blasphemie? VVhich had seuen heades. S. Of these things I haue spoken suf∣ficiently heretofore. 12. a. 3. 4. And the vvoman vvas clothed in Purple and Rosecolour, and bedecked vvith golde, and preciouse stone, and perles, hauing a cup of gold in hir hand, full of the abhomination and filthynesse of hir vvhore∣dome. And the woman was. V. Rightly is Antichriste lykened too a woman.False forsa∣kers of the Churche. For wheras hys false Church is gone away from Christe the heade and husbande of the true Churche: yet wyll shée néedes bée taken still for the true Church, yea and for the wyfe of Christe, and so acknowledged too bée of all men. And therefore Paule speaking of rauening Wolues, that shoulde go aboute too make hauocke of Christes flocke, saythe: Euen from among your selues there shall ryse men that wyll speake frowarde thyngs, too leade awaye Disciples after them. Actes. 20. f. 30. Also Iohn speakyng of the Antichristes, whiche were alreadie gone oute intoo the worlde, saythe: they wente oute from among vs, but they were not of vs. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 19. Therefore although he resem∣ble the shape of man, and bée decked with the tytle of Christs bride, yet is he no better but a very beast, & a horrible mōster shrowded in mans shape, to deceyue men vnwares with the more ease. Also the shape of woman betokeneth that there is no manhood or sparke of such manlinesse in Antichrist,The woman∣nishnesse of the Romishe sorte. as we read yt there was in the woman that brought forth the Male∣child heretofore, 12. b. 5. but al things weake and womanish, so as it maye well be saide of his Kingdome accordyng as the Prophet hath foretold, womanish persons shall haue the rule of them. Esai. 3. a. 4. Of which thing a man may see an euidēt proofe in the Shepope Ione.Ioane the shee Pope, For shée was an arrant whore bothe in bodie and mynde, and yet shée was aduaunced
to so great dignitie, that all mē worshipped hir as a God.  they that either went afore hir or followed hir, were v hir in any thing saue in kind. For those most holie fathers e∣pressed very wel hir maners, hir disposition, hir diuelishe c¦tinesse, and hir excessiue shamelessnesse. Also this woman i called the great whore, bicause shée compelleth men to away from the true worshypping of God, vnto Idolatrie  Diuelishe doctrines.The stately∣nesse and pōpe of Papistrie. Clothed in Purple. M. That is to saye,  princely apparell. For the Papistes make their beast, th by reason of their kingly Priesthoode and the charter of Co∣stantine, they haue materiall swordes too bée drawen out in the defence of their temporalties by the hands of Priests a Bishops after the maner of the kings of this world. S. B¦sydes this a man myght easly gesse at the manners and me¦nings of that harlot, by hir verie attire and outward beh¦our. And Iohn séemeth to allude to the false doctrin or wor¦ly wisedome, which the true wisdome, that is to say, the hea¦uenly wisdome, bringeth in vnder the resemblance of a pa¦ted harlot. And bedecked with gold and precious stone & perles. M.The glorious hipocrisie of the Romishe Antichrist. For she beareth men in hand, that shee is inlightened wy the wisedome of God, wheras for all hir saying, shée fighte ageinst it, as well in wicked déedes, as in doctrine, more tha the very Paynims and Iewes do. S. Moreouer, al these thing betoken the Hypocrisie and feyned holynesse, wherwith th Harlot goeth about too hyde hir abhominations, that she  the easelyer deceyue men vnwares, and allure them bo too wonder at hir and too bée in loue wyth hir: accordyng to this texte, they bée whyted tumbes, Math. 23. c. 17. Or else (i yée liste) accordyng too Daniels Prophesie,The richnesse and greate wealth of the Papacie. it betokeneth d¦syre of ryches vnder pretence of godly Religion.

Reade in the ende of Eusebiussis Chronicle, that is too saye, in the Chronicle of Mathewe Palmer of Florence annexed too Eusebius.Things dedi∣cated to God. And lastly (accordyng too a Rule of theyrs whyche begynneth wyth, Looke what is once dedicated too God. &c.) they make themselues Lordes of all things that are dedicated too God. Nowe then in as muche as the Churche plate of Golde and Siluer were thoughte too bée dedicated too God: they are no more in the power of the layitie, but of the Clergie, too dispose of them as they lyste. In the same cace stande the Images of Golde and Siluer, wyth Crosses and Reliques decked wyth Golde, Siluer and precious stones, and all other stuffe and orna∣mentes of Churches. Among all these thyngs they founde moste plentifull mynes of Golde and Siluer: wheras not∣wythstandyng, all these thyngs belong too Christes poore seruauntes: and both Ierom and Ambrose are of opinion, that in tyme of necessite, they shoulde bee pulled away and dealte among the poore.Now the Ro∣manists spent their reue∣nues. The graunt of Constan∣tine. But these men contrariwyse lash them oute vppon theyr Courtizanes, and Ganymedes, vpon hoūds, barded horses, & armed souldyers. And although they bee owners of so greate riches, yet gape they still after those which they haue not. Ouer and besides all these things, adde also the Patent of the Emperour Constantine whiche they brag of, namely that he should giue them his noblest Cities, Townes, and Castles: which things they hold by graunt frō the kings of Fraunce since the rebelling of the Romane By∣shps ageinst the Emperour, rather thā by the tytle of Con∣stantines gift:hristes pa∣trimonie. so as it maye rightlyer bée called a reward of treason than a free gift. And marke mee heere his shamelesse
blasphemie, in that he dares boast, that these things are the patrimonie or lyuelode of Christ, when euen Christ himselfe sayes nay too it. The foxes (saythe he) haue borrowes, and the foules of the aire haue nestes: but the sonne of man hathe not whereon too rest his heade. Math. 8. c. 8.S. Peters patrimonie. Or if he will call it Peters patrimonie, (for he braggeth bothe of them:) Pe∣ter speakes ageynst hym, saying,The Roma∣nistes can not proue that ∣uer Peter was at  Golde and Siluer I haue none. &c. Actes. 3. a. 6. Besydes all this the Pope and all hys horned Byshops and hooded Doctors wyll neuer bée able too proue that Peter was at Rome. For if he sat there as bishop by the space of seuen yéeres (as they themselues report) & that he was put to death there the same day twelue moneth after ye Paule was: It must néedes folow that he was at Rome ey∣ther when Paule wrate his Epistle too the Romanes, or else when Paule was there hymselfe and wrate hys Epistles too the Collossians and too Timothie. C. But surely it had bin vncourteously doone of Paule too haue ouerslipped Peter vnsaluted among suche a number of holie men as he gree∣teth by name in the sixetéenth Chapter too the Romanes, if Peter had béene there at that tyme. Which thing doubt∣lesse he woulde not haue doone, B. considering howe chare he was in reckenyng vppe suche as were much meaner. Like∣wise when he wrate commendations too the Colossians from the Sainctes at Rome, in the fourthe too the Colossians: it is not lykely that he had so small regard of Peter as too leaue out his commendations, specially sithe he reckeneth vp cer∣tein of the circumcision (that is too saye Iewes) by name, be∣sides diuers other of inferiour calling. But what shall wee thinke of Peters owne dooyng? In my first defence (saythe Paule) no man slacke to me, but all men forsoke me. 2. Tim. 4. c. 16. Either we must say yt Peter among the rest did shrink from defence of the Gospell, & so consequently after a sort de∣nie his maister ageine, whiche hath no likelyhod of truth: or else that he was not at Rome as the Romish sort beare mē in
hand,The Pope is the contrarie of that which he boasteth himself to be. which séemeth too bée most true. Now then  that in doubtfull caces, nothing is better too bée folowed th probable and likely coniectures: no man that hath euen an meane iudgement will bée made too beléeue that which they auouche. Also the Pope makes warre with houge hostes for the patrimonie or heritage of the Apostles, whereas Paule sayth, the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but Ghost∣ly, and mightie too Godward. 2. Cor. 10. a. 4. And yet they still vaunt themselues too bée Christes Vicars, whereas they fo∣lowe nothing lesse than Christes commaundementes, which were the duetie of Vicars too doo. They boast themselues to bee Apostolike, that is too saye, the successours of the Apo∣stles in the ministerie, when in déede they oughte rather to bée called Apostatike.The Popes golden cup. Hauyng a Cup of Golde. M. He speaketh of vntowarde and counterfeit doctrine. The Pope beasteth himselfe too haue the Scripture: but he corrupteth it with hys lewde glozes, and maketh men too drinke of the trou∣bled or rather stinking water of puddles in sted of Gods pure woord, whych is the meate and drinke of our soules. Thse blasphemous and abhominable decretalls which the Romi Antichrist serueth his guestes wythall, are yet extant: how∣beit that he serue them in a golden Cuppe, that is too wit, vnder the name of Christes Vicarship, vnder the colour of the doctrine of the Gospell, and vnder suche other glori names, as that all things proceede of the instinct of the hly Ghost, and that he cannot erre. &c. A. This is the golden cup which hath beguiled many. Full of the abhomination and filthi∣nesse. q. d. Vnder pretence of certeyne places of the holy scrip∣ture, he ouerthroweth the Religion of God, and leadeth men away from the true God too most cursed Idolatrie. 5. And in hir forehead vvas a name vvitten, a my∣sterie, great Babilon, the mother of vvhoredome and of the abhominations of the earth.
And in hir forehead was a name written. S. Certesse not open∣ly and in those expresse wordes, but in a Mysterie dothe he pretende thys style: which neuerthelesse the godly being in∣lyghtened wyth the holy Ghost can bothe reade in the Har∣lots forehead, and also vnderstande it: accordyng as is sayde afore of the names of blasphemie which seeme glorious and holie too the vngodly. Great Babylon. M. That is too saye,A description of the Courte of Rome, vaū¦ting hirselfe to be the La∣die and moo∣ther of all re∣almes, and to be euerlasting. the Citie of Rome, or the Popes Courte. The mother of the whoredome and abhominations of the earthe. This is proued already in the thyngs that went before, bycause that from hir is drawen an example of the continuing and defendyng of all the abhominations and errours that are continued in the Churche. S. It is knowen well ynough that euen from of olde tyme, shée hathe vaunted hir selfe too bée the mother and Ladie of all other Cities of the whole world. Which thyng some of the Churchmen beganne too blowe abroade euen in Ieroms tyme, as it is too bée seene in a certeine Epistle of hys vntoo Euagrius. Also through lyke blasphemie they in∣tytled hir with the style of Euerlasting Rome, bycause they thought that hir kingdome shoulde haue indured for euer: whiche thyng the Pope of Rome doothe with lyke blasphe∣mie boast of his owne dubble holie Sea. Finally we sée here, by the reporte whych the holye Ghost gyueth hir, what ma∣ner a mother shée is: namely of all whoredomes and ab∣hominations, bothe in doctrine and in life, from whence a sinke of greace hath flowed out into all Christen Realmes. 6. And I savve the vvoman drunken vvith the blud of the Sainctes, and vvith the bloud of the vvitnesses of Iesu: and I vvondered vvhen I savve hir, vvith great vvondering. And I sawe the woman drunken. C. If any man dare speake ageynst hir abhominable errours,The Popes maynteyne their religion by the sword. he is out of hande put in hazarde of hys lyfe. For this mother of whoredomes cannot
abyde too héere hir faultes touched oute of Gods worde: but desyreth too doo all thyngs after hir owne luste and lyking, withoute gaynesaying. For it is manyfeste that the Pope mainteyneth hys feyned Religion by the sworde, as well as the Emperours dyd in olde tyme, and as the Turke dooth at thys daie.The wonder∣full increase of Antichryst. And I marueled when I saw hir. M. Héere the Pro∣phete taketh vppon hym the person of suche as wonder too sée euill men aduaunced in thys worlde, considering howe they héere, that there is sore punishment laide vp for them. So Daniell woondered at the things whyche the little horne spake presumptuously. Daniel. 7. d. 11. So did those twayne also which sayde, Howe long will it bée ere these wonderfull things come too an ende? Daniel. 12. b. 6. A. And so haue wée herde it alreadie sayde of the Beast, who is lyke the Beast? Heretofore. 13. b. 4. G. For that Beast shal bée augmented and increased, vntill wickednesse bee come too his full growthe: which thing shall betyde in the greatest and last beast of all, that is too wit, in Antichrist himselfe, who shall reigne about the knitting vp of the world, and the more that the sixth head is diminished, the more shall the seuenth and eighth heades aduaunce themselues. 7. And the Angell said vnto mee, vvherefore vvon∣derest thou? I vvil tell thee the mysterie of the vvomā, and of the Beast that beareth hir, vvhiche hathe seuen heades and tenne hornes. 8. The Beaste that thou haste seene vvas, and is not: and he shall come vp oute of the bottomlesse pit, and shall go too destruction. And the inhabiters of the earthe vvhose names are not vvritten in the booke of lyfe from the firste makyng of the vvorlde, shall vvonder too see the Beast that vvas, and is not, and yet is.
And the Angell sayd vnto mee. M. q. d. There is no cause why thou shouldest wonder at the aduauncemente of this wo∣man, for hir dignitie shall not indure for euer. I will tell thee the mysterie of the woman, A. that is too saye, of the Antichri∣stian Churche. And of the Beast that beareth hir, that is too say, of Antichrist or the Diuell himselfe, who is the heade of all the vngodly. VVhich hath seuen heades and tenne hornes. A. For the seuen heades looke the nynth verse, and for the ten hornes looke the twelfth verse nexte following.The renuing of the Roman Empire in Mahumet & the Pope. The Beaste that thou hast seene, was, and is not. S. The Monarchie of the Romane Empyre beganne euen then too bée weakened, and to drawe too destruction by reason of ciuill and inwarde warres. In the place thereof came the Alcorane and Poperie, in whiche the Romane Monarchie is renewed ageine, as hath béene séene heretofore, 13. a. 3. This Monarchie therfore which is the Mo∣narchie of the world but in tytle only, is the same which after the diuidyng and displacing of the Empyre of Rome, should from small beginnyngs at the firste (for what is bacer than a fisherman, and a common souldyer?) mount vp af∣terwarde intoo the place thereof: and yet for all that, euen shée hirselfe shall perishe also, and not laste for euer as shée maketh hir bragges too doe.Antichriste cōmeth fro hell, and shall to Hel againe. Shall come vp out of the bottom∣lesse deepe. Antichryst and hys Churche clymbeth vp too the toppe of hys Churchly dignitie, and mainteyneth the same wyth the temporall sword: which is the vylest heresie yt can be and ful of darknesse. Neither is any man promoted now a dayes in the Churche by the Pope of Rome, which hathe not mounted vpon the bottomlesse déepe of this wicked heresie by fauouring it and furthering it. And shall go intoo destruction. V Like as the beast came out of the bottomlesse pit, so shall he bée caste intoo the bottomlesse pit ageine. For Antichrist and all hys bande shall bee damned for euer.The worlde standeth in awe of Anti∣chryst more than of God. And the inha∣byters of the earthe shall wonder. A. Thys woonderyng imply∣eth a certeyne standyng in awe, as if Iohn should say, many
shall easely bée deceyued by gazing at the gloriousnesse and power of the Beast, and shall stande in awe of hym as if he were of all other the myghtiest. S. And surely (too let passe the Triumphes of the Turkes by the way) who would not wonder at the Alexanders, Iulies, and Clementes, too sée them triumphing for deposing of Kings, for recoueryng the Landes of the Churche, for vanquishyng the Florentines, and suche other kynde of Victories? what if it were gyuen too the Romishe Byshops, too bée that in verye déede whych they boast themselues too bée, that is too wit, too bée the Monarkes of the whole worlde? Vndoubtedly then shoulde yée sée the Triumphes of Iulius Cesar, or rather more roy∣all tryumphes than euer hys were. VVhose names are not written in the booke of lyfe. That is too saye, whiche are not chosen too euerlastyng lyfe. From the first making of the world. Looke in the eyght verse of the thirtéenth Chapter, and in the fifth verse of the thirde Chapter héeretofore. Too see the beast which was & is not.Rome beeing glorious in hir owne conceyt, is of no esti∣matiō among the godly. That is to say, too sée the old and decayed Rome, after a sorte receyued ageyne in the presumptuous statelynesse of the Pope and hys Courte. And yet is not Rome the same in déede, whyche he pretendeth and boasteth too bée. That is too saye, althoughe shee vaunt hir selfe to be the Mother, Head, and Ladie of the world, and too haue soue∣rein power ouer al men in earth: yet is shée farre wide from the puissance of the auncient Rome. And yet is. A. That is to say, shée séemeth too bée somewhat: howbeit, that is but in the eyes of those whom the holy Ghost hath not inlyghtened by faith, For in the sight of the godly, shée is nothing else but va∣nitie and abhomination. 9. Here is a mind that hath vvisedome. The seuen heades be seuen hilles, vpon vvhich the vvoman sitteth. Also they be seuen Kings. Heere is a mynde that hathe wisedome. M. q. d. He that is in∣dued
with true wisedome will easly take héede to himselfe,No man vn∣derstandeth heuēly thing of his own wit without the spirit of God. that he be not deceiued by this harlot or the beast, which dra∣weth many men to wonder at hir, A. when as notwithstan∣ding, horrible damnatiō is prepared for hir. M. Neuerthelesse this sentence may be referred to that which is added imme∣diatly after: so as it should be a certaine preface to stirre men vp to giue eare. By the way we be taught, that no man is a∣ble to comprehende this misterie by his owne wit, but that we haue néede of the diuine and heauenly wisedome, to teach vs the things that serue for our profit. The seauen heads be se∣uen hils.A liuely des∣cription or Rome. V. Iohn could not haue pointed out Rome more effec∣tually, except he had expressed hir very name. For it is well knowen that she is built vpon seuen hils: which thing ye shal scarce finde written of any other Citie in the world. S. Now then we see the strong stayes wherevnto the harlot, that is to say, false Religion, the veryOr Churche of mischiefe. malignant Churche, and the very Sinagog of Satan, leaneth euer since the beginning. Also they be seauen kings. A. Concerning these seauen kings looke afore. 12. a. 3. 10. Fyue are falne: One is: and another is not yet come. And vvhen he is come, he must tarrie but a short time. Fyue are falne: One is. S. At such time as Iohn wrate these things, there were fyue kings passed,The popishe tyrānie is one of the seuen kings. and the sixth (that is to wit the Emperoure of Rome) was then present, that is to say, he hild the souereintie. And the seuenth kingdome, that is to wit, of Antichrist (whiche shoulde succéede the Empyre of Rome) was not yet come: the beginning whereof was the kingdome of Mahumet. Moreouer the beast whiche in thys place representeth the popish Church with the head thereof, is the eighte, and one of the seauen. For he and Mahumet to∣gither receiue the Romane Empyre whiche was quite defa∣ced. Howbeit there be some which thinke that the eighte ought to be referred to the people of Gog and Magog. But
more rightly do others vnderstand it of the Romish Byshop, bycause that although he chalēgeth Lordship in religion ouer other Churches of the world, before the reigne of Mahumet: Yet was it a long time after, ere he began to mainteine it with the temporall sword, vntill at length he mounted to so high authoritie, that he became mightier in battell, yea and more terrible than the Emperoure himselfe his defender. His tyrannie therefore must be reckened for one in numbe∣ring the kingdomes of the worlde. In respect whereof Iohn saith, he is one of the seauen. And another is not yet come. Hée speaketh of the reigne of Antichrist. For although there were many Antichrists gone out into the world already: 1. Iohn. 2. c. 18. Yet notwithstanding for asmuch as the matter was as yet darksome, and the Romane Monarchie (in place whereof it is certaine that Antichrists kingdome hath succéeded) was not as yet cessed: Iohn doth aright to say, that the seauenth kingdome was not yet come. And when he commeth he must tarrie but a short time.Howe the shortnesse of Antichristes reigne is to be vnderstoode. S. Sith that Antichrist hath (as it appée∣reth by the promises) reigned now about a thousand yéeres: the short time whereof Iohn maketh mention in this place, and the scripture oftentimes in other places, must be constru∣ed in this wise, that (according as the Apostles haue taught) all the whole time from Christs passion foorth, is called short and the last time. M. For thus speaketh Paule: These things are written for our warning, vpon whome the endes of the world are come. 1. Cor. 10. c. 11. Also Iohn saith, my little chil∣dren, it is the last time. &c. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 18. Or else it is so tear∣med, bycause the vngodly are said to shortē their days, & to be stopped in the middes of their race, and bycause destruction shall come vpon them sodenly and vnlooked for, and suche o∣ther like things to the comfort of the godly, whome God will assist in due season, and yet for all that they be willed to haue patience and to tarrie the Lords leysure, if he make delay. &c. Psal. 27. d. 14. & Habacuk. 2. a. 3.
11. And the Beast that vvas and is not, is euen the eyght and one of the seuen, and goeth into destructiō. And the beast that was and is not. A. I haue sayd already,The swift de∣cay of Anti∣christ his king¦dome. that Antichrist kingdome is betokened by this beast, in whome the Monarchie of Rome semeth after a sort to be receyued. And therfore Antichriste is sayde to be of the number of the seuen kings. S. Neuerthelesse by reason of his singular woor∣king of naughtinesse, he also is hild within his boundes. In consideration wherof Iohn sayeth, that the beast himselfe, Is euen the eyghte. G. Although Antichrist haue vsurped the same kingdome whiche was the seuenth kings, namely the Em∣pyre of Rome: yet notwithstanding for asmuch as he hathe inuented a certein new preheminence of reigning (that is to wit spirituall) his dominion is after a sorte seuerall from the others. And goeth into destruction. A. Iohn repeteth this for the comfort of the godly, least their harts myght quayle by reason of Antichrists bitter persecutions, wherwith he shall rage against Gods people. q. d. Although he boaste that his king∣dome is euerlasting: yet shall it soone decay. For the Lorde will slea the wicked with the breath of his mouth. Esai. 11. a. 4. & 2. Thess. 2 b. 8. 12. And the ten hornes vvhich thou haste seene, are ten kings vvhiche haue not yet receyued their king∣dome, but they shall receyue povver as kings in one houre vvith the beast. And the ten hornes. &c. A. I haue told you afore, 12. a. 3. that by all these hornes is betokened strength and power.The excedn great powe of Antichr and the ki of Christe dome subiec vnto him. For this beast should neuer haue proceded to so extreme wicked∣nesse, as to be worshipped welneere of all mē for a God, if he had not bin armed with exceding great power. And truly al ye Romane Emperours, euery chone yt haue bin since Charles surnamed ye great, haue bin boūd by oth to ye bishop of Rome, wheras before that tyme the bishop of Rome was created by
the election and authoritie of the Emperoure. Wherefore not vnfitly is this horrible beast said to haue ten hornes, sée∣ing he is supported by the puissance of so great princes. Ne∣uerthelesse these ten hornes may also be applyed to the kings whiche haue acknowledged the Bishop of Romes suprema∣cie, as the kings of Naples, Portingale, Spayne, Fraunce, Englande, Denmarke, Swedeland, Poole, Hungarie, and Beame. For these are the chéefe kings of the west, or of Chri∣stendome at this day, by whome are meant all other prin∣ces also, who euen at this day in so great light of Gods word, can scarsly be brought to beléeue, that they are beguiled by Antichrists deceites and Satans iuggling tricks.This prophe∣sie belongeth to the latter tymes. VVhiche haue not yet receiued their kingdome. A. It is euident euen by this place, that this prophesie is to be referred to the last times. And therefore it must not séeme straunge, though the men of old time reached not by and by to the vnderstanding of the misteries that lye hid héere. But they shall receyue power as kings.Clergimen e∣ull wyth Princes. S. For asmuch as Iohn vseth the word [as] which is a marke of similitude or likening: some not vnfitly haue apply∣ed the thinges that are spoken héere, vnto Archbishops, of which sort Italy hath many: and such as Yorke and Canter∣bury are in England: Strygon in Hungary: Magdeburg, Co∣lon, and Mentz in Germany: Burges, and Turon in Frāce, and many other whome it were long to recken vp: all the which do at leastwise match, (if they do not also surmount) the authoritie of the chéefest princes: and yet by the way wée will let slip Cardinals, Patriarkes, Primates, Abbots, may∣sters of the holy Ghost and of sainct Valentine, and of saint Antony,Masters of the Rhodes. Commendators of sainct Iohns knightes, of ye dutch knightes, and of sainct Georges knights, and of others which were exceeding rich in treasure, and bare the countenance of mightie princes. All these yeeldeth their power to the beast after the time hée began once to be estéemed as a God, (that is to wit, after that the Empyre of Rome was rent asunder) and were ready to do him seruis as oft as hée called vppon
them, against whomesoeuer he listed. And this is the cause why Iohn séemeth to haue said, They shall receiue power as kings, in asmuch as they reigne not at their owne pleasure, but at the pleasure of Antichrist aforesaid, and so are not very kings indéede, but as it were kings. Finally it is shewed heeretofore, that in the kingdom of Mahumet, or of ye Turks, the eace standeth in likewise, and all princes are at comman∣dement to the only king. 13. These haue one mind, & shal yeeld their strength and povver vnto the beast. These haue one mind. A.The prero∣gatiue, seruice and honour that the Cler∣gymen yeld to the Romishe Antichryst, He speaketh of the same kings and princes that he spake of in ye former verse, who are al sworne to Antichrist whose féete they kisse, and worship that beast with knéeling downe vnto him, berkening to his hests, and obeying his lawes. And to be short, with one minde and one intent they stand against Christs Gospell in defence of Anti∣christs tradition, beléeuing that he only hath the key and vn∣derstanding of the scriptures, and that Christs spirit is remo∣ued into his brest, or rather that he is some God, by meanes whereof he cannot erre. M. Furthermore they auouch it too he iustly done of him to commaund his Sacrifizers to com∣mitte manslaughter, in asmuch as he is the temporall Lord of the Citie of Rome. They say he may sell pardons for mo∣ny, bycause he is not bound to kéepe the state of Apostleship which he professeth: That he is not a Churchrobber for spen∣ding vppon himselfe and his, the Church goodes that are ap∣poynted for ye poore. That he doth right in clayming the first frutes of all Bishopriks that be voyde: That hee dothe law∣fully in mainteining hys souereintie ouer the vniuersall Church, by the temporall sword: That for a péece of money hée may lawfully put them asunder that were lawfully ma∣ried togither. That the bestowing of all ecclesiasticall pro∣motions belongeth to him by reason of his vniuersall autho∣ritie: That he hath full as great iurisdictiō ouer the Church,
as Christe had when he was vppon earth. All these things (say I) are Antichrist like.The blindnes of Princes & prelates in sub¦mitting them∣selues to the Pope. And all princes whiche  these or any of them, are to be hild for fauorers of Antichrist, in asmuch as they reiect the doctrine of Christe, and accept the doctrine of Antichrist. And shall yeelde their strength and power to the beaste. A. That is to saye, they shall by all me¦nes fauoure Antichriste, and further his kingdome, dep∣ding wholly vppon him. M. For they shall thinke that they cannot haue anye iust tytle to reigne, otherwyse than by fauouring hys errors. 14. These shall fyght vvith the Lambe, and the Lamb shall ouercome them (for he is Lorde of Lordes, and king of kings) And they that be on his syde [vvhich are] called and chosen and faithfull. The Princes of the worlde make warre ageinst ChristThese shall fyght with the Lambe. A. That is to saye, Th shall make warre against Christe, S. Notwithstanding that they eyther boast or beléeue that they do him seruis. A. The we knowe wel ynough, that at the suggestion of Antichrist▪ kings and princes do moste féercely persecute the faithfl disciples of Christ, that is to wit, the folowers of the doctrine of the Gospell. M. But by and by héere is added a woorde of singular comfort vnto all the godly whiche are troubled for defending the Gospell.The victorie of the godly is by sufferance and patience, neyther is it they them∣selues, but it is Chryste in them, that fighteth and ouercommeth. And the Lamb shall ouercome them. S. A woonderfull incounter, and a more wonderfull victorie. For in lists mē are wont to match cruell wild beasts one against another, and not Lambes against Lyons But in this com∣bate, a Lambe is matched against a seuenheaded beaste, yea and against the cruellest of all wyld beasts, or rather with a horrible monster. The Lambe then fyghteth with the Dragon, euen with that hideous beast whiche all the in habiters of the earth do wonder at: but yet the Lamb get∣teth the better hād, yea and he getteth it by méekenesse one∣lye and by patience. 1. Peter. 2. d. 23. So also do the chosen
sort fyght with the beast, and they also do ouercome him by méekenesse and by the word of God, putting ouer themselues to him that iudgeth rightuously, and bestowing their soules by well doing, in the hand of their maker. 1. Pet. 4. d. 19. For like as Christ ouercame his enimies by suffering meekely vppon the crosse, at what time he being led as a sheepe to the slaughter opened not his mouth, but hilde his peace as a Lamb before the shearer: Esay. 53 b. 7. Euen so the true Chri∣stians standing in defence of the Gospell with méekenesse and quiet dealing, shall by manifold afflictions (yea and euen by very death if néede be) ouercome Antichrist and all hys host at length. A. Wherevnto perteineth also this incourage∣ment of Christs vnto his diciples: Possesse ye your soules in your patience. Luke. 21. d. 19. Be it knowen then to all the elect, that thys fyghting of theirs, is not their owne, but the Lambs, and that the victory also shall be hys. Hee both fyghteth and getteth the victorye in the elect, albeit that they be killed as men ouercome. In the worlde (sayth he) yee shall haue distresse, but bee of good theere, I haue ouercome the worlde. Iohn 16. d. 33. S. Therefore let not the faithfull bée afrayde, let them not shrinke: For to dye manfully in this quarrell, is to get the victory. A. Where∣fore thys place is not agaynste that whyche auoucheth, that Goddes Sainctes shall be vanquished and ouercome y the beaste, Héeretofore. 11. b. 7. For there is discourse made of the outwarde shew and iudgemente of the worlde: and heere is treated of the assured and true victory whiche is proper only to Gods elect. Therefore although that in the eyes of man, the faithfull séeme farre inferior and weaker han the enimies of the truth: Yet not withstanding for as∣much as the death of thē is precious in the sight of the Lorde, Psalm. 116. c. 15. No doubt but they be happye and throughly lissed as manye as suffer deathe in defence of the truthe f the Gospell. For whiche matter looke afore. 14. c. 13.Why Ch ouer et the o. For hee is Lord of Lords. S. It is the cause why the Lambe
getteth the vpper hand. For his father will make all his e∣nimyes his footestoole. Psal. 110. a. 1. Vnto him hath be giuen all power in heauen and earth. Math. 28. d. 18. Him hath he ordeined to be iudge of the quicke and the dead. Act. 10. g. 42. He onely hathe souereigne power as immortall king of all worlds. Although then that he shewed himself a Lamb in his passion: yet shal he vtter the force of Lyon in his iudgement, and shall shewe himself a iust iudge in adiudging his enim to eternall death. And king of kings. S. Christ is sayd to be La of Lords and king of kings, bycause all the kings of the earth haue their reigning of him and by him, that is to witte,  much as he granteth vnto them: whose hartes also are in his hand. Prouerb. 21. a. 1. Who iudgeth them in the midds of thē, Psal. 82. a. 1. And taketh away their breth when he listeth. Psal. 76. c. 12. In vayne therfore shall the kings & princes of ye earth fight against him, seing he is able to dispatch thē  and cleane with one blast of his mouthe. According as it is written, Psalm. 2. c. 9. And they that be on his syde. •. Supply thou,The cause why the god∣lie doe ouer∣come Sathan & the world. Shalt obteine victorie with him. And the Apostle Paul witnesseth that we be chosen and called in him. Therfore  is all one as if Iohn should say, not only the Lamb shall ouer∣come the beast: but also they that be chosen and called in hi shall ouercome him to, that they may continue faithfull. For to ouercome indéede, is to hold out to the ende, whatsoeuer temptation or what soeuer aduersitie befalleth vs. Called and Chosen. A. Although election or choosing go in order before cal∣ling, according as Paule witnesseth. Rom. 8. f. 30. Yet not∣withstanding, héere it is put after Calling, as the thing that outweyeth the other. q. d. The godly are not only called, but also chosen before the foundations of the world were laid consideration wherof they may warrant themselues the ¦tory. And in this respect Peter willeth them to indeuer make their calling and election certeine and sure. 2. Pet. .10. Also he addeth Faithfull. For faith is the sure witnesse of our election and inward calling.
15. And he saide vnto me: the vvaters vvhiche thou hast seene, vvhere the vvhore sitteth, are people, and folke, and Nations and tungs. And he saide vnto me: The waters vvhiche thou hast seene.The reigne of Antichrist is vniuersall. A. Iohn is taught yet more fully, to the end he may afterward profit the Church. VVhere the whore sitteth.M. That is to say, Antichriste who goeth a whorehunting from the law of the Gospell. Are people. Namely which are to be damned, bicause they fauoure hir. And folke, and Nations, and Tungs. That is to say, of all sorts of men, as well Iewes as paynims and Chri∣sten men, both of Cleargy men and men of warre, and also of common people. S. Héere we sée openly, that Antichriste reigneth, not in one place or ouer one nation or language only, but vtterly ouer all people, nations, and tungs: whyche thing is done chéefly by Religion. And these people being se∣duced by false Religion, and by meanes thereof being vtter∣ly without faith and feare of God, are caried with most for∣cible violence like a riuer that hathe burst out his bankes, into all maner of heynous wickednesse: according as Paule sheweth. Eph. 4. e. 19. &. 1. Thess. 4. a. 5. 16. And the ten hornes vvhich thou savvest vppon the beast, [euen] they shall hate the vvhore, and make hir desolate and naked, and eate hir flesh, and burne hir vvith fyre. And the ten hornes vvhich. &c.The turning away of the world from Antichrist to the Gospell. A. Now he treateth of the cō∣uersiō of such as in times past were deceiued by Antichrists guiles: whiche persons the Lord will at length bring backe to the knowledge of his truth. [Euen] they shall hate the whore. That is to say, they shal hate that womanlike and nice Anti∣christ, who refuseth the yoke of the euangelicall law, and dée∣meth it too rough for him. And make hir desolate, and naked. q. d. Suche as shall repent them of their going astray, shall withdrawe their accustomed consents from him, and denie
their seruis to such a deceiuer any more. Therefore we ga∣ther héere vpon, that these kings being one day made priui to the harlots abhominations by the preaching of the Gos∣pell, and perceiuing Antichrist to be discouered, shall at lēgth hate the harlot, and despising hir power, dispossesse hir of the lands which she had intruded vpon by craft and main force, and denie hir the tributes and seruices of which I haue spo∣ken afore, and leaue hir naked and vtterly destitute of al suc∣cour. A. For the preaching of the Gospell shall be of so great force, that through the brightnesse thereof, the abhominati∣ons whiche lurked erewhile in darknesse, shall be broughte foorth into the light: so as they shall be abhorred and lothed, e∣uen of those whiche had earst mainteined them with sword and force of armes. S. Neuerthelesse there be some whyche thinke this thing to be partly fulfilled already, at such tyme as the Romane Emperours left their seruing of Idols, and receiued Christes Gospell. Also others vnderstand it to be meant of Tyrants which would neuer suffer ye goodly Cities and multitudes of most welthy nations to flourish in theyr own peace, but made hauocke of al things by battell. Which thing appeereth euen in Nero, whome Story writers report to haue bin more cruell against the Citie of Rome, than all hir enimies had bin. A. But the first exposition of all séemeth to approch néerest to Iohns meening: namely that it is giuē vs to vnderstand, how héere is foretold the wonderfull con∣uersion and amendment of such as had bin seduced by Anti∣christ. Whereof we haue a hansell set before our eyes alrea∣dy, in asmuch as we sée certaine kingdomes, principalities, and potestates, despise or rather hartely reiect the cursed er∣rors of Antichrist, & to serue God alone through Iesus Christ and openly to allow and admit ye only preaching of his shor togither with the lawfull administration of the Sacramēts.The hatred of them that wer seduced by Antichrist, a∣gainst him and his doctrine. And eate hir flesh. S. That is to say, when they haue so forsa∣ken hir and despised hir, they shall put hir to wonderfull tor∣ments, bycause she had so shamefully deceiued them. And
truly if ye marke it throughly: no man at this day anoy the Papists more, than euen they who héeretofore vndertooke the defence of them, namely as long as they were yet snar∣led in the snares of Antichrist. And burne hir with fire. M. That is to say, they shall with one consent iudge hir worthy to bée burnt with fyre. A. A wonderfull exchange. They whiche in times past déemed Antichrists enimies (that is to saye, the preachers of the true Gospell) to be worthy to be burnt, shall at length be so enlightned with the light of Gods word, that they shall thinke them worthy of singular honor and re∣ward, and by sound skill denounce Antichrist himselfe wor∣thy of vtter damnation, by whose procurement they had per∣secuted the godly in times past. Also this may be applyed too the images and Idolls which are set vp in Antichrists king∣dome not without great dishonor vnto God. For the princes vpon whome the light of the Gospell hath shone, are wont to burne all such things in despite of Idolatrie. 17. For God hath put in their harts to do that which liketh him, and to be of one consent to giue their king∣dome to the beast, vntill the vvordes of God be ful∣filled. For God hath put in their.All things are done by Gods prouidence, yea euen the blinding of the reprobates. A. Now Iohn commendeth gods iust iudgemente, declaring that nothing is done héere by chaunce, but all thinges are gouerned by Gods secrete prouidence. S. If thou maruell (saythe hée) how it commeth too passe that kings fauoure the beast: it is done by Gods will, too the intente the vngodly may bée the more blyn∣ded by suche prosperitie, and the godly bée exercised wyth persecutions by the wicked, that they myght not bée in loue with the world, but lift vp their whole hartes with earnest praying vnto God, to deliuer thē out of the hands of their eni∣mies, by aduenging his glory vpon them. So was the hart of Pharao hardened by the will of GOD. Exodus. 9. c. 12.
So the high preestes of the Iewes wraught crueltie vppon Christ by the will of God. Act. 4. f. 28. So saide Paule of suche as should be seduced by Antichrist: God will send them strōg illusions, that they may beleeue lyes, and that all may bée damned whiche haue not beléeued the truth, but haue allo∣wed vnrightuousnesse.Why God suffereth men to be blynded. 2. Thessa. 2. c. 11. To do that which he li∣keth. S. That is to lay, to do that whiche God liketh: or (as o∣thersome would haue it) the beast. q. d. To do that whiche ly∣keth the beast, that is to wit Antichrist, and to folow his will for a time. G. By the way it is to be noted, that the Lord God doth now and then suffer the princes of this world to be blin∣ded, and to go astray for a time, to the intent that at length when they know of Antichrists errors, they may rise vp the stronger and stoutlier against him, and (to the vttermost of their power) cast him downe from his seate. S. Also it must harten vs to the bearing of any persecutions be they neuer so gréeuous, sith we know that all things are done by the wil of the father, to his owne glory and the common welfare of the whole Churche. To yeelde their kingdome to the beaste. M. That is to say to suffer themselues to be euer ruled by the Diuell and Antichriste. Vntill the wordes of God be fulfilled. A. That is, till all things be come to passe that Gods seruāts the Prophets haue foretolde concerning the kingdome of Antichriste. 18. And the vvoman vvhiche thou hast seene, is the great Citie vvhiche hath dominion ouer the kings of the earth. A playne pointing out of Rome to be the seate of Antichrist.And the vvoman which. &c. •. It is that great Citie where false Religion reigneth and from whence it gusheth as out of a sinke, vnto al kings, princes & people: terme hir Baby∣lon or Rome, whither ye list: for eyther of them both hath al∣most euer persecuted Gods people in maintenāce of the false Religion wherewith they be bestayned. Euen so Ierusalem beareth the person of the Churche and Citie of God, from whence so euer the worde of GOD floweth vnto the
heathen, according to this text, The lawe shall go out of Si∣on, and the word of the Lorde out of Ierusalem, Esai. 2. a. 3. •. Then shall Rome the head and ladye of the world perish: The Romish Church, poperie, and power which extended it selfe and the dominion therof ouer all kings of the earth, shall perish. A. But the true Church (be it neuer so despisable to the world ward) shall stand for euer. For it is founded vppon the firme Rocke. Math. 16. c. 18. The eighteenth Chapter. AND after this, I sawe another Angell come downe from heauen, hauing great povver, and the earth vvas inlyghtened vvith his brightnesse. AFter this I saw.The contens of this Chap∣ter. A. This Chapter declareth that when Antichrist is come to the fulnesse of his wickednesse, he and all his shall be destroyed: at whose horrible destruction both men and Angells shall take occasion of gladnesse, when they sée the force of Gods word manifested, maugre the wils and resistence of the enemyes. Another Angel.The manner of the peintng out of the fa of Antichrist. S.M. This is the sixth vision of this booke, wherin (vnder the resemblance of Babylon) heere is described the iudgement of the malignant Churche, that is to wit the destruction of Antichriste and his kingdome. Iohn therfore intending to descrybe this thing, first bringeth in the Angells to bring tidings of it, and to hast the inhabiters to flée away with speede. Afterward he brin∣geth in the same Angells stirring the elect sort to the execu∣tiō of sore punishment, as if they were the tormenters of the euill. Thirdly he maketh the kings of the earth, the merchāt∣men, and the shipmen, to sing as it were songs of sorow for ye destruction of hir. Fourthly he setteth downe the mirth song of the godly and of the Angells for the same destruction. And he setteth all these thinges before mens eyes in such sorte,
with so wonderfull inlargement and so liuely representati∣on, that they may séeme to be presently in doing. So is it done also in the Prophets Esay. 13. a. 6. &. 14. b. 5. &. Ierem. 50. a. 3. &. 51. a. 2. Come downe from heauen. B. Many take this An∣gell to be Christ,Christ. who came from heauen as Iohn witnesseth very often, Iohn. 6. d. 38. &. 16. d. 28. Who also hath equall po∣wer with his father, according as it is saide héere, Hauing great power. A. Christ saith of himselfe, All things are deliue∣red vnto me of my father. Math. 11. d. 27. M. Also, all power is giuen vnto me both in heauen and earth. Math. 28. d. 18. But there is no impediment why we may not take this Angell to be some one of the holy and seruisable spirites,An Angell. which pu∣blisheth the sentence that is giuen vppon that wicked Citie, and that he should be said to be indued with great power, by∣cause he proclaymeth the sore and terrible iudgement of the great Citie, that is to say of the kingdome of Antichrist. And the earth was lightened. A. It is an ordinarie matter in the scriptures,Heauenly brightnesse. to make mention of brightnesse, when they tell of the sending of any heauenly messengers vnto men: althogh it fall not out alwayes to be so. And their comming so be¦ked with heauenly brightnesse, is to moue the minds of their héerers the more, that they may receiue the message that is brought vnto them, none otherwise than if it came out of Gods owne mouth. For thus we reade in the Gospell: And lo, the Angell of the Lord stoode by them, and the brightnes of the Lord shone round about them. Luke. 2. a. 9. And when Peter lay in prison, Beholde the Angell of the Lorde std by him, and a light shone in the house. Act. 12. b. 7. So in thys place the earth is saide to be lightned at the heauenly bright∣nesse of this messenger, to the intent the héerers shoulde re∣ceiue his message the more héedefully.
2. And he cryed out strongly vvith a loude voyce, saying: Great Babylon is falne, is falne, and is become a dvvelling place of Diuels, and a dungeon of all vn∣cleane spirites, and a cage of all vncleane and hatefull birds. And he cryed out strongly.The terrible and vnreco∣uerable fall of Antichrist. A. All these things haue a forcible∣nesse in them. He that bringeth this message is an Angell, yea and an heauenly Angell, indued with great power, and arayed with heauenly brightnesse. Agayne, he not only vtte∣reth, but also crieth out, yea and that strongly, not with a low, but with a loude voyce. Saying, namely to all that be wil∣ling to heare. Great Babylon is faln, is faln. These tidings com∣fort and strengthen the godly, least their harts might fainte and be discouraged by reason of Antichrists persecution. And Iohn alludeth to the place of the Prophet, where he prophe∣syeth that the earthly Babylon shall bee wasted, and be in∣habited for euer with monsters of the wildernesse. Esay. 13. d. 21. Which thing Iohn applyeth héere to the spirituall Ba∣bylon which is become a dwelling place of Diuels for euer: that is to witte, bycause it shall euermore be conuersante among the thickest of the Diuells, whose deuises she had practised in thys present lyfe. Also there is another place in the same Prophet Esay. 21. c. 9. Where he hath the same sen∣tence concerning the iudgemente of the earthly Babylon, set downe in the selfesame wordes. Whiche two places Iohn séemeth to haue knit togither in one héere. And hee describeth the fall of Antichrist to bée suche, as no resti∣tution of hys kingdome may be hoped for anye more. Moreouer thys dubbling of the worde [falne,] and the putting of it in the tyme past, are set downe too beto∣ken the certeintie and surenesse of the prophesie, and the greatenesse of the dubble peyne, as well of the bo∣dye as of the Soule. By calling of Babylon Greate, hée
giueth an incling that the number of suche as go affray and are seduced, is greater than the number of them that kéepe the right way: according as Christ affirmeth, saying: Wide is the gate, and broade is the way that leadeth to destruction, and manie they be which enter in therat: but streight is the gate and narrowe is the way whiche leadeth vnto lyfe, and fewe they be which fynd it. Math. 7. b. 13. And it became a dwel∣ling place of all Diuelles, and a dungeon of &c. That is to saye, Diuells shall dwell there. By these words Iohn betokeneth the greatest desolation that can be. And diuers Epistles of Petrark the Italian Poet, do witnesse that this ought to bée vnderstoode of Rome. 3. For all Nations haue drunke of the vvyne of the vvrath of hir vvhoredome, and the kings of the earth haue committed fornication vvith hir: and the mer∣chants of the earth are made rich through the abundāce of hir pleasures. Idolatrie and false Religion the cause of the fall of An∣tichrist.For al Nations haue drunke. &c. G. The cause of ye ouerthrow and destruction of this Citie, is for that she hathe made the whole world drunken with hir deceites, S. in somuch as she hath made all the inhabiters of the earth to fléete away from the true worshipping of the one God, and from true godly∣nesse, both by trade of teaching, and by example of false Re∣ligion. By meanes hereof many being giuen ouer into a wicked minde, haue bin vtterly drowned in all manner of horrible sinnes. So the Apostle imputeth the heynous of∣fending of the Idolatrous Gentiles in all kyndes of moste horrible crimes, vntoo false Religion as the very groun∣ded cause of them.The Popes and their sha∣uelings haue taught prin∣ces all vngra∣ciousnesse. Romans. 1. c. 24. Also looke Ieremy. 51. a. 6. And the kings of the earthe haue. &c. A. He speaketh of the great men and princes of thys worlde, whyche haue con∣sented to the heresies and abuses of Antichriste. For they made more account of the doctrine and example of suche as pretended the chéefe state of perfection, than they made
of God and godlinesse and all honestie of lyfe. For who taught kings and princes too make warres one vpon another, and too slea manie giltlesse persons, for tryfling causes, and often∣times also euen for vaine styles? Euē the Byshops of Rome, who lightly are neuer better occupyed. Who hathe vnhalo∣wed the holie and reuerend religiousnesse of othes, and made it vtterly voyd and despised? Euen our cheefe Bishops. From whence haue our Christen Princes learned the statelynesse of the heathen Emperours, and their sumptuous superfluitie passing the superfluitie of Asia? Euen of Christes Vicars, of Archbishops and of Abbotes. Of whom I pray you haue they learned their vnsatiable desire of gaine, and of scraping all things togither by hooke and by crooke on al sides, but of those Moneymongers, Church robbers, Vsurers, Deceyuers, and Rackers of pooremen, that is too wit, of these most holy, most reuerend, and religious fathers, which resemble poore Christ and his Apostles vnto vs? Furthermore, who hath brought Aduoutrie, incest, cōmon stewes, fornication, yea and filthier géere too, which I will not speake of, intoo Princes Courtes and wealthie Cities, and brought to passe, that they migbt be committed euerywhere openly and vnpunished? forsooth euē those singleliuers and gelded fathers, which bynd themselues too chastitie by othe at such time as they take orders. And af∣ter the same manner myght be spoken of manie other horri∣bler sinnes, which gushe from them as out of a sinke, intoo all Christendome. For who can suffer himselfe too bee borne in hand, that such things as haue bin spoken afore, doo displease God, when he shall see those moste deuout fathers too bée the cheefe dooers in them? Herevpon it hath bin commonly sayd, that the Clergie are wel assured there is no Hel, and that the same is wel seene by their lyfe. And the merchants of the earth.Segging is good coe with them. A. These marchants may bee taken too bee those of whom Pe∣ter writeth in this wise. They shall make marchandize of you throughe couetousnesse by their feined spéeches. 1. Petr. 2. a. 3. S. For it is wel knowen, that some Chapmen haue bought
the Ecclesiastical benefices and pardons through diuers Dio∣cesses at the Harlots hand,Aduousons. and solde them agein vnto others. Furthermore whatsoeuer deinties are within the vttermost boundes of the worlde, they bring them too the purple whore which is so riche of Gold, to the intent that shée may haue the preferment of them: and yet these self same persons inioyne much fasting to other folkes. 4. And I herd another voyce from heauen, saying: Come out of hir my people, least yee bee parttakers of hir sinnes, and receiue of hir plagues. And I herd another. &c. A. He addeth a warning from G, vntoo al the godly,The shun∣ning of wic∣kednesse and wicked com∣panie. that they should separate themselues from the companie of the vngodly, least they might bée wrapped in the same punishmentes and perishe with them. Come out of hir my people. S. The like thing is written in Esai. 48. d. 20. and in Iere. 51. a. 6. and in Zachar. 2. b. 6. and in other places of the Prophets. For they wil haue vs in any wyse to flee a∣pace out of Babylon. A. Great oute of doubte is Gods graci∣ous goodnesse and fauourablenesse towardes his seruauntes, where through he counselleth them to hye them betymes out of the company of those whom he hath determined to destroy, least they myghte runne in daunger too bee consumed wyth them. S. What maner of shunning and separating this ought to bée, the scripture teacheth euerywhere. For Chryst sayth. Come vntoo mée all yée that bée faynt and loden. &c. Math. 11. d. 28. And Paule saythe, I haue written vntoo you by a letter, that you should not meddle with whoremongers. 1. Cor. 5. c. 2. B. Also, let them that vse the world bée as though they vsed it not: for the fashion thereof passeth away. 1. Cor. 7. f. 31. A. Also, haue not too deale wyth the fruitelesse workes of darkenesse, but rather rebuke ye thē. Eph. 5. c. 11. S. And Peter sayth, déer∣lybeloued I besech yée as strangers & wayfarers, to absteine from fleshly lustes which fight ageinst the soule. 1. Pet. 2. b. 11. And Iohn saith, Bée not in loue with the world nor with the
things that bée in the world. 1. Iohn. 2. b. 15. Therefore our go∣ing out of Babilon, (that is too say out of the companie of the vngodly) must bée in mind. And too go out of it in mind, is vt∣terly to abhorre and condemne the Religiō, superstition, prac∣tizes, maners, life, and finally al other things of that mischée∣uous Citie. Which thing Iohn séemeth to betokē in this pre∣sent place. Least yee bee partakers. Least yée lyke, allowe,Partaking of other folkes offences. and commit the same things. Like as the Apostle sayth, draw not the yoke with the vnbeleeuers. For what fellowship hathe righteousnesse wyth vnryghteousnesse, or what companie hath lyght wyth darkenesse, or what agréement is there be∣twéen Christ and Beliall? 2. Cor. 6. c. 14.15. Also, it is ynough for vs that in tyme past wée haue spent our lyfe after the con∣uersation of the Heathen, walking in wantonnesse, lustes, drunkennesse, eating, drinking, and abhominable worship∣ping of Images. 1. Petr. 4, a. 3. A. Which thing woulde God they would bethinke them of in good earnest, whiche lyue at this day vnder Antichristes dominion, defyling themselues wyth horrible seruing of Images and cursed superstitions: and yet for all that doo boast of the knowledge, yea and of the profession of the Gospel. M. And the cause of thys hastie auoy∣ding is alledged when it is sayde. And receyue of hir plagues.Partakers in fault must be partakers in punishmn. q. d. If yée bée vnlike them in life, yée shall not bée like them in punishmentes. For the surest waye for any man that wyll lyue aryght, is too eschew the wicked dooyngs of the vngodly, ouer whom hangeth horrible and assured daunger of deathe. S. Therefore like as men are wont to flée apace out of Cities that bée infected with the plague, or which are like too bée be∣séeged, as soone as they haue vnderstanding of it. A. Euen so it is the propertie of such as be godly and wise, to shunne those (as much as may bée) whom Gods wrath pursueth, too make a cleane riddance or dispatch of them.
5. For hir sinnes are gone vp to heauen, and God hathe bethought him of hir vvickednesse. Of rysing vp to heauen, or crying to God for vengeanceFor hir sinnes are gone vp too heauen. M. That is to say, into Gods presence too bee punished. When the scripture inhaun∣ceth the greatnesse of mens sinnes & wicked doyngs, it saith that they bee gone vp too heauē, or vntoo God, or else that they cry oute vnto God. The cry of the Sodomites and Gomor∣rhytes (sayth it) and their sinne was exceeding great. Gen. 18. c. 20. And his iudgement went vp to the heauens and was ca∣ried vp aboue the cloudes. Iere. 51. e. 19. Also, Behold, the wa∣ges of the labourers that reaped downe your Corne, whiche you haue withhilde from them by deceyte, cryeth out, and the cries of them that haue reaped is entered into the eares of the Lord of hostes. Iames. 5. a. 4. And God hath bethoughte him. &c. S.How God bethinketh or remem∣bereth. The Lord is said to bethinke him of mens wickednesse, when he taketh vengeance of them, bicause that as long as he punished them not, he semed either to haue had no knowledge of them, or else to haue forgotten them. Gen. 18.21. 6. Revvarde hir euen as shee revvarded you: and giue hir dubble according too hir vvorkes: poure in dubble vntoo hir in the same Cup vvhiche shee filled vnto you. Misconstru∣ing of scrip∣ture for desyre or reuenge.Reward hir euen as shee rewarded you. C. Some giddiheades intending too make the holie scripture subiect to theyr ow lewde affections, haue abused this and such other like places, as thoughe it were lawfull for the godly too vse cursing and banning, yea and also vengeance and crueltie ageinst the An∣tichristes: But the plaine meaning of this place is, that G will pay the wicked persecuters with reward of dubble ven∣geance: whiche doing of his, the elect are willed both to ac∣knowledge and to commend, too their owne comfort. B. Thers is a like threatning in Ieremie the. 50. e. 29. and in Abdias. 1. c. 15. Whervnto agreeth this of Christes, SG. Looke with what
measure yée meate vnto others,What is ment by doubling of punishments. with the same shall it be mo∣ten to you again. Math. 7. a. 2. Luke. 6. f. 38. And giue hir dubble according. The punishmentes are called dubble, bothe for the sorenesse, and also for the lōglastingnesse of them. M. The per∣secution which the Antichristians lay vppon men is but bo∣dily and of short continuance: but the paine whych they thē∣selues shall indure, is euerlasting bothe of bodie and soule. S. Also by these words is betokened in what cace the Babilo∣nians offended most, namely in murthering Gods people for Religions sake: & therfore shal they haue those people too bee theyr iudges. Poure in dubble vnto hir. &c. I haue tolde you héeretoforefore. 14. c. 10. that by the bytter Cup, the Scripture betokeneth afflictions. 7. Looke how much she glorifyed hir self, and liued in pleasures, so much giue yee hir of payne and sorow. For shee sayeth in hir hart, I sit a Queene and am no vvidovve, neyther shall I see any sorowe. Looke how much shee glorifyed hirself. A. Forasmuch as am∣bition or vain gloriousnesse and pride,Pride & am∣bition be chief causes of An∣tichristes de∣struction. are the welspring and roote of all euil: The holie Ghost sheweth, that ye chiefe cause why Antichrists kingdome shal perishe with horrible venge∣ance, is for that it hath bin presumptuous and cruell out of measure. For it glorifyed it selfe, by taking vppon it both the powers, aswell princely as Préestly, which neuerthelesse it bused shamefully in all sensualitie.The careles∣nesse of the Antichrists o Romish pre∣lates. So muche gyue yee hir of payne and sorowe. M. That it too wit, declare it openlye hat shée it wretched bothe in bodie and soule. For shee saythe n hir heart, I sit a Queene. G. Iohn compareth Antichristes kingdome in all poyntes vntoo Babylon: and therefore too betoken the destruction thereof, he vseth the same woordes whych the Prophete dooth. Esai. 47. b. 8. S. The Antichristes hemselues haue bin puffed vp intoo so great pride, that they aue gottē abundāce of al things ye pertein to ye peace of this world. They take their pleasure without feare in their seats,
they commaund, they play the Lords, they put off the Lordes day to a far time, or rather they leade their life after suche a sort, as thoughe there were no iudge sitting in Heauen. For thus think they with thēselues: who is like vnto vs? Are not we alone Lords of the whole world? Are not all ye kingdomes of the earth vnder our hand? Is not the Emperor our seruant & lackie? Doth not the multitude of mē fauor vs? Are wée not in league with the greatest & mightiest Princes of the whole world? A. Are not all of them bound vnto vs by othe? who is he then yt is able by any meane too doo vs harme? G. Such are the spéeches of the Lords enemies, who will bée preferred a∣boue al other men. I am no widow. G. Like as a mother glorieth in the multitude of hir children, euen so these men glorie pre∣sumptuously in their great & (as ye world thinketh) most sure leagues with many Princes.God resisteth the proude. But the Lord God whose hand no mans is able to eschew, wil one day beréeue them of al oc∣casion of glorying. For he will bring their horrible wicked∣nesse too light, & throw them headlong into vtter & dreadfull damnatiō, whosoeuer sayth nay to it. For he is wont to resist the proud, and to beate downe their haultie lookes, like as he stretched out his mightie hand, & executed the rightfull iudge∣ment of his wrath ageinst Pharao, Saule, Nabugodonozor, & such like. For he hath made it for a law euen from the be∣ginning ageinst all the childrē of pride, that the more they ad∣uaunce themselues, the déeper shal they bée cast down: accor∣ding as it is said by the Prophet, If the Lorde haue purposed it, who shall disappoint his determination? If his hande bée stretched out, who shall cal it backe? Esai. 14. f. 27. Therfore the godly maye assure themselues that all suche manner of Antichristes shall bée cast downe for theyr pryde, thoughe they tryumphe neuer so muche,The fond ca∣relesnesse of the maugnant Churche, and their iestyng at Gods long orbearng. and welter at ease in theyr pleasures, bearing themselues in hande that they shall neuer bée punished, and saying: I shall see no sorow? S. Iohn bothe taunteth and also inhaunceth the vayne Surenesse which the wicked Churche behyte themselues, bothe by reason of
their Religion and also by reason of their power. Thus sayth the vngodly: I shall neuer be remoued. Psal. 10. b. 6. And the naughtie seruaunt saythe, It will bee long, ere my mayster come. &c. Mat. 24. d. 48. Also, where is the promise of his com∣ming? For since the daye that oure fathers fell a sléepe, all things continue still in their state from the beginning. 2. Pet. 3. a. 4. For so say they in their hartes which are besotted and blinded with the prosperities of this world. But contrariwise the godly knowe that they haue not a Citie of continuance héere, but seeke for one that is too come, Hebr. 13. c. 14. & there∣fore they promise themselues no surenesse in thys worlde. Furthermore they knowe themselues too haue a continuall incounter ageinst the aduersarie powers. Ephe. 6. b. 12. And also that all the whole world is set vpon mischéefe. 1. Iohn. 5. d. 19. What surenesse then should they promise too themsel∣ues? A. They héere howe Paule saythe, Let him that thinkes himself to stand, take heede that he fall not. 1. Cor. 10. c. 12. Also, worke ye your saluation with feare. Phi. 2. b. 12. Also, Sée that ye passe the time of your pilgrimage in feare. 1. Pet. 1. c. 17. All which things must not abridge the certeintie of the saluation of the chosen: but only kéepe them frō the vaine carelesnesse of the fleshe which worketh destruction. 8. Therfore shall hir plagues come in one day, death and sorovv, and hunger, & she shal be burnt with fire: for strong is the Lord God vvhich shall iudge hir. Therfore shall hir plagues come in one day. A.The iust pu∣nishment of Antichrist and his adheren s He threatneth hir with vtter destruction. q. d. She shall be wholly ouerwhelmed with miseries. For by ye plagues that be reckened héere, Iohn meaneth al kind of misfortunes, as death, famin, pestilence, fire, (perchaunce fyre from Heauen, such as the Lord rained downe vpon the Sodomites Gene. 19. e. 24.) and vncomforta∣ble sorowe insuing vpon the same. Death, in sted of that shee promised to hirselfe continuall lyfe in thys worlde. And so∣rowe, in sted of hir laughter and gladnesse, wherethrough she
scorned the Prophetes which tolde hir the truth aforehande: according too this saying of the Lord, wo bée too you ye laughe, for yee shall weepe. Luke. 6. d. 25. And hunger, in place of hir su∣perfluitie and wealthinesse. And shee shall be burned with fire. Like as shee hath burned the true Disciples of Christ and the ministers of his Gospell with fire: so also shall shée hée bur∣ned with fire, and the same shall bée an vnquenchable and e∣uerlasting fire. Math. 3. c. 12. &. 25. d. 41. S. Neuerthelesse these things may be referred (after their maner) to the paines, both of the present life & of the life to come. A. For like as the faith∣full begin their euerlasting life euen in this present worlde Iohn. 17. a. 3. & Rom. 8. e. 24. & Eph. 2. b. 6. & Phi. 3. d. 26. & Colo. 3. a. 1. Euen so the reprobates begin to féele the peynes of hell before the last day, although they hée stark blind for the time, and flatter themselues wonderfully. For strong is the Lorde God which shal iudge hir.An answer to an obiection. S. He answereth courtly to a conceit, wherby a mā might perhappes obiect, in this wise: And how may so mightie a Kingdome be cast downe, yea and that in one day? Herevnto therefore he answereth thus: The Lord which shall iudge, is strong. He can neither bée moued by in∣treatance, nor withhilde by any mans force, from executing his iudgement vpon hir with sharpnesse: according as it is sayd, for the ielosie and anger of hir husbande will not spare hir in the daye of vengeance, nor giue eare too any mans in∣treatance, nor receiue neuer so many giftes for hir discharge Prouerb. 6. d. 34.35. Salomon in that place speaketh of God after the manner of a lawfull husband that taketh an aduou∣terer with his wife. The like thing is written in the Pro∣phet, Although these thrée men Noe, Daniel, and Iob were in the middes of hir. &c. Ezech. 14. d. 14. He therfore is most too be feared, which is able too destroy both body and soule togither into hell fyre. Math. 10. c. 28.
9. And the Kings of the earth shall bevvaile hir and vvring their handes ouer hir vvhich haue committed vvhoredome vvith hir, and liued vvantonly vvith hir, vvhen they shall see the smoke of hir burning. And the Kings of the earth. &c. A.The sorow of such as cōsen∣ted to Anti∣christ. Too the intent ye Iohn may set that horrible destruction of the Babilonish or Antichristi∣an Kingdome the better before mens eyes, so as all things may séeme too be presently in dooyng: he maketh the greate men of the kingdome to sing a sorowfull song, and lykewyse the merchantmen and maisters of shippes: for those are the chéefe that committed fornication with the whore of Baby∣lon. A. Neuerthelesse, their repentance shal bée to late, bycause it shall spring cheefely, not of the misliking of theyr sinnes, but of the losse of their bodily goods. VVhen they shall see the smoke. &c. That is to say, when they sée the whore condemned to wrath and endlesse curse. 10. And shall stande a far off for feare of hir punish∣ment. M. That is to say,The sodeyne hart greefe of suche as hang vppon Anti∣christ. they shall demeane themselues after the maner of such as stand aloofe when they be afraid of any thing, bewailing hir sodein and vnloked for decay. Saying, Alas, alas. This dubbling betokeneth not only the certein, but also the dubble punishment, both of body and soule. That great Ci∣tie Babilon, that mightie Citie, But now the weakest of all Ci∣ties. For in one houre is hir iudgement come. This is it whiche Paule hath spoken concerning the vngodly: When they shall say, peace, and all is safe, then commeth sodein destruction vp∣on them, as the throwes of a woman that laboureth of chyld, and they shall not escape. 1. Thess. 5. a. 3. 11. And the merchants of the earth vveepe & vvaile o∣uer hir, bicause no man buieth their vvares any more.Who be An∣tichrists mar∣chants- And the marchantes. &. A. Manie and sundrye are the mar∣chants of the earth, whiche haue bin inriched by the sumptu∣usnesse and superfluitie of the whore of Babilon. For who
can well declare hir pryde and superfluitie? And none haue a quieter life & luckyer trade of Merchandize, than such as buy and sell the soules of men: of whiche sorte are those shauen Monkes and sacrifyzers, which buy, raunsome, lay too gage, & redéeme ageine the soules of deadmen out of the fire of pur∣gatorie: which tie, bind & vnbind mens consciences, but not without a péece of money: which make open markets of holy things, and set all things to sale, so they may get money for thē. Such varlets curse their owne liues when their craftes are laid open, by laying the light of the Gospell too them. By meanes whereof they themselues are despised, their kitchen wexeth cold, & their belly pyneth. Bicause no man buyeth theyr wares any more. A. Paule speaketh of deceiuers in thys wyse. They shall no more preuaile: for their madnesse shal be eui∣dent vnto all men. 2. Tim. 3. c. 9. as it may now be perceyued euerywhere by the shining of the light of the true Gospell. 12. Their vvares of Golde, and Siluer, and precious stone, and Perle, and cloth of Reynes, and Purple, and Scarlet sicke, and all Thyenvvood, and al maner vessell of Yuorie, and all maner vessell of most costly vvood, and of brasse, and yron, and Marble. &c. The super∣fluitie of An∣tichrist & his adherents.Their wares of Gold. A. Nowe he numbreth vp the things by percelmeale, which he had spokē concerning the merchants in general. And he describeth the superfluitie of ye Antichrists, first in gorgeousnesse of apparell: secondly in buildings, and vessells to eate & drink in: thirdly in peintings, & perfumes: fourthly in meates & drinkes: fifthly in the sundry kindes of their bearing beasts & cariages, among which he numbereth also the soules of mē, bicause those shamelesse rakehels were wont to abuse mē no lesse than beasts: which thing is openly seene at this day, whē the Pope is caried aloft vpon the shoul∣ders of certeine chosen groomes, & that not for healthes sake (as some mē would think) but for statelinesse only, represen∣ting therin the maiestie of the auncient Emperors of Rome:
and Sixthly in Musicall instrumentes, whereof there be dy∣uers kindes, and mo newe ones bee inuented from time too time. 15. The merchants of these things which vvere vvex∣ed riche, shall stande a far off from hir,Ioy & glad∣nesse turned into sorowe. for feare of hir punishmente, vveeping and vvailing. A. Like as hereto∣fore the gloriousnesse, the strength, and the puissance of the beast drew all men to wonder at him: (in so much as manye saide, who is like the beast? who is able to fight wyth hym? Heretofore, 13. b. 4.) Euen so, when he shall bée stripped quite and cleane from all his strength and helpe: all those whyche haue bin allured & deceiued with his gloriousnesse shall won∣der at him after a cleane contrarie maner. 16. And saying, alas, alas, that great Citie vvhiche vvas clothed in Reynes, and Purple, and Scarlet, and dekt vvith Gold and precious stones and Perles. A. The rehersal of the former gloriousnesse doth not a little augment the gréefe: for it is a certein kind of vpbrayding. M. Agein it is called the great Citie, bicause the example of all the backsly∣ding of the Christians procéedeth from thence. 17. For in one houre so greate riches are come too nought. A. Looke the tenth verse of this present chapter. And euery Shipgouerner, and all they that occupied ships, and shipmen that vvorke in the Sea, stoode a farre off. Forasmuch as Antichrist boasteth himself to be Lord, not on∣ly of the land but also of the Sea, or rather of ye whole world: Iohn maketh mention of Shipmen also, and of such as tra∣uell and traffike vpon the Seas. All thcse shall bée striken in excéedyng great heauinesse of mind, when they shall see the quite fordooing of Antichrist to be hard at hand. 18. And cryed vvhen they savve the smoke of hir burning, saying vvhat citie is like vnto this great Citie. A. Looke in the ninth verse.
19. And they cast duste on their heades, and cried, weeping and vvayling, saying: Alas, alas that greate Citie vvherin vvere made rich al that had shippes in the Sea by reason of hir costlinesse: for in one houre shee is made desolate. And they cast dust. S. Héere thou séest the ouerlate, inforced, yea and fruitelesse repentance of the vngodly,The ouerlate  futelee repentance of the vngodly. suche as was the repentance of Pharao. Exo. 9. f. 27. Of Saule. 1. Sam. 24. d. 16. Of Esau, Hebr. 12. e. 17. and of the traytor Iudas, Math. 27. a 3.4. For ye wicked are not turned vntoo God earnestly, but rather make a iangling ageinst his iust iudgemente, and could finde in their hartes too quarrell with him whom they féele a sore iudge whither they will or no. And cryed weeping and wayling &c.Who he cheefe mourners for the  of An∣tichrist. That is to wit, for the losse of their gayne And it is not to be ouerslipt, what sort of men they be whom Iohn dothe specially bring in héere as chéefe mourners for the de∣struction of Babilon: that is too wit kings, (that is too say Tyrantes) Noblemen, Merchantment, and Shipmen: but neither shepherdes nor husbandmen, for such maner of men as these bée, serue rather for necessarie vses than for super∣fluous luste, and are too simple trades of lyuing. For in one houre is shee made desolate. Hys often repeating of this thing, is too shewe the vanitie of this kingdome which shall be abo∣lished so quickly. 22. Reioyce ouer hir thou heauen and yee holie A∣postles and Prophetes: for God hath giuen your iudge∣ment vpon hir. The reioy∣cig of ye godly at ye execution of Gods iust udgments.Reioyce ouer hir thou heauen. A Nowe are all the elect cal∣led too spirituall gladnesse for the vtter destruction of An∣tichrystes Kingdome. For lyke as the vngodly shall mourne ouer hir, and bee striken with heauinesse more than can bee spoken: So shall all the godly bée excéedyng glad when the enemies of Christ and hys Church shall be ouerthrowen
and beaten downe, like as Christ chéereth vp his seruants too ioyfulnesse, saying: when these things begin to come too passe, thē looke vp & lift vp your heads, for behold your redemption is at hand, Luke. 21. f. 28. And in another place it is sayde, the righteous shall reioyce whē he séeth the vēgeance, and he shal washe his hands in the blud of the sinner. Psal. 58. b. 9. S. But it is doubtfull whose voyce this should be which allureth the godly vnto reioycing: whither it be some Angel that speaketh, or whither it bée they that make the morning. For there bée some which admit this latter: bicause the sayde parties bée∣ing conuicted by the verye truthe, gyue glorie vntoo God euen ageinst their wils, like as they séeme also too be compel∣led to repent and to acknowledge their sinne. Neuerthelesse such maner of alluring to spirituall gladnesse, ought rather too bée referred to some Angel. A. For thus is it said of the vn∣godly. After that the fifth Angell had poured out his Vyole, they gnew theyr owne tungs for gréefe, and rayled vpon the God of Heauen by reason of the gréefe of theyr sores, and repented them not of theyr woorkes. Héeretofore. 16. b. 10.11. S. Furthermore by the name of Heauen, eyther he be∣tokeneth the heauenly powers, or else (after the manner of the Scriptures) for the better expressing of the greatnesse of the ioy, he calleth the dumbe and lyuelesse creatures too it, by a manner of surmounting spéeche. And yee holie Apostles and Prophetes. By these as by the excellenter sorte, he vn∣derstandeth the residue of the chozen sorte: all whyche shall woonderfully reioyce at Gods iuste iudgement, and at the destruction of the wicked: accordyng as wée cyted euen now oute of the Psalme. A. And Iohn matcheth the Prophets and Apostles togither, like as Paule doth also, Ephe. 4. b. 11.The sundrie functions of the Church. The reason whereof is this: that wheras of the one functiō charge or office of teaching in the Church, Paule reckeneth vp fyue sundry termes, springing either of the maner of tradition, or of the circumstances of them that teache or bée taughte: yet they come all to one poynt, so as one selfesame person is both
an Apostle, Euangelist, & Prophet. &c. Howbeit yt there is some maner of difference in the signification of them. For A∣postlesApostles. are those choycer sorte E. whyche were sent by Chryst himselfe to preache the Gospell ouer all the worlde, confir∣ming the same wyth myracles & bearing witnesse of Christs resurrection: C. of which sorte were the twelue, Math. 10. a. 1. into whose state Paule was called afterward. B. These being bounde too no certeine abyding, went from countrie to coun∣trie preaching Chryst, and traueled as Ambassadors too sun∣drie Nations, C. planting Churches, and setting vp Christes Kingdome wheresoeuer they came. ProphetesProphets. were the no∣table interpreters of the prophesies: who through a certeyne singular gifte of reuelation, were able too apply them too the present matter. C EuangelistesEuāgelistes. were nexte vntoo Apostles and had theyr office muche like them, sauing that they were beneath them in degrée of dignitie. B. These gaue themselues chéefly too instructing of the people, and preached the Gospell to thē as plainly & simply as might bee. C Of which sort was Timothie and such like. For although Paule match Timo∣thie with him in doing commendatiōs, yet doth he not make him his felow in Apostleship, but kepeth that name peculiar∣ly too himselfe. 2. Cor. 1 a. 1. and Coloss. 1. a. 1. And in writing too him he saythe thus: G. Bée watchfull in al things, harden thy selfe in afflictions, go throughe with the worke of an Euan∣gelist. 2. Tim. 4. a. 5. Pastors or shepherdsPastors or Shepherds. are such as being indued with a singular gift, know how too feede Christs hun∣grie sheepe with his healthfull worde as with most pleasant pasture, how too heale them that be atteinted, how too bryng backe them that be gone astray, B and how to keepe away the wolues from the Lordes flocke. C. These haue some certeyne flocke committed to their charge, which is the marke where∣by they be discerned from the other afore. A. And concerning these there be diuers things written by the Prophets & speci∣ally by Ezech. 34. a. 1. & also by Iohn. 10. b. 11. &. 21. c. 15. & in the Acts. 20. f. 28. C. Those be called Teachers or Doctors,Doctors or Teachers. whiche
haue the charge as well of framing the shepeherdes aright as also of instructing the whole Church. B. Of which sort be Tu∣tors, ScholemaistersTutors and Schoole∣maisters. that teach children their Cathechisme, and suche as doo eyther priuately or publikely instructe those that shall haue the charge of the people, or the people them∣selues. C. Neuerthelesse he that is a teacher maye also some∣times bée a Shepherd or Pastor, howbeit that in good respect shepeherdes are separated from teachers, bycause they bée two sundrie indowmentes. A. And of these fyue sundrie gifts yée may sée more in Rom. 12. b. 6. and .1. Corin. 12. a. 8. For God hath gyuen your iudgement. S. The Sainctes made intercessi∣on by hartie prayer, that it myght come so too passe, saying: Howe long is it O Lorde, whych are holie and Soothfast, that thou doost not iudge and auenge our bloud at their hands whiche dwell vpon the earthe. Heretofore. 6. c. 10. A Wher∣vntoo also perteine the great numbers of complaintes of the holy men which are red of euerywhere in the Prophets and Psalmes. Vpon hir. Namely vpon the great Citie or vpō the great whore, that is to say, vpon Antichrist. 21. And a mightie Angell toke vp a stone like a great milstone, and cast it intoo the Sea, saying: vvith suche violence shall that great Citie Babilon be cast, and shall henceforth be found no more. And a mightie Angell tooke vp. &c. A. Too the intent that the faythfull may bée the more assured of the things that are spo∣ken of the destruction of the Babylonicall Citie,The certeinty and sodein∣nese of Anti∣christs fall. (that is too saye, of Antichristes Kingdome:) Iohn layeth foorthe the matter it selfe by a certeine lyuely representation as it were before mennes eyes. The myghtie Angell betookeneth héere, all suche as withoute feare doo shewe forthe Gods iudge∣ment ageinst Antichrist and all the vngodly, specially aboute the latter tymes. VVyth suche Violence shall Babylon that greate Citie bee caste. By thys comparison he setteth be∣fore meanes eyes the sodeine and vnrecouerable ouerthrowe
of the babilonish Kingdome. For like as a great Milstone be∣ing cast into the déepe of the Sea is not séene any more: e∣uen so the doyng awaye of Antichristes Kingdome shall bée so woonderfull and terrible, that no print shall remayne of it afterwarde. And in calling it the greate Citie, Iohn séemes too haue had an eye too thys saying of the Prophete. The sea came vp vppon Babylon, and shée was ouerwhel∣med wyth the multitude of waues, Ieremie. 51. e. 42. And within a fewe lynes after, when thou hast made an end of the reading of this booke (sayeth he) thou shalt tye it to a stone, and cast it into the middes of Euphrates, and shalt say, Euen so shall Babylon bée drowned, and shée shall not ryze from the sighte of the affliction, whyche I bryng vppon hir, but shall bée quite dispatched. Ieremie. 51. g. 64. M. The more then that Antichrist and his Princes bée exalted: so muche the sorer and déeper shall they fall. For the Lorde shall speake vntoo them in hys wrathe, and trouble them in hys sore dis∣pleasure, Psalm. 2. b. 5. and at the lengthe he shall throw them headlong intoo vtter destruction. And shall bee founde no more. That is too saye, shall no more bée had in remembe∣rance. For shée shall sinke downe intoo the déepe endlesse pit of Hell, there too bée tormented with euerlasting paines. 22. And the voyce of Harpers and Musicians, and of pypers and trumpetters, shall no more bee herd in thee: and no craftes man of vvhatsoeuer crafte he bee shall be found any more in thee: and the sound of a mill shal be herd no more in thee. The vtter de∣struction of Antichrystes kingdome, and the bereauyng it of all plea∣sure and de∣lght for euer.And the voyce of Harpers and Musicians. G. By this verse he meaneth, that all pleasure and delight of mind which men in∣ioy in this lyfe, shal cease. So also is it sayd in the Prophets, the ioy of Timbrels is ceassed, the noyse of daunters is done, the myrthe of Harpes is at reste. Esai. 24. b. 8. Also, I wyll make the multitude of thy songs too cease, & the sounde of thy
harpes shall be heard no more. Ezech. 26. b. 13. And no Crafts∣man of whatsoeuer. &c. By these wordes he betokeneth the vtter destruction of the Citie. q. d. There shall no mo goodly buildings be reared in thée, neither shall there any curious vessels be made in thée, for all Craftsmen shall cease in thee. And the sound of a mill shall be no more heard in thee. M. Thys must be vnderstoode of all sorts of fyne bread, and of the sun∣dry sortes of bakemeates made by cunning of pasterers. q. d. There shall be no more dressing of swéete meates nor Cookery in thée, as there hath bin héeretofore. 23. And the light of candle shall no more shine in thee: and the voyce of brydegroome and bryde shall be heard no more in thee. For thy Merchaunts vvere the great men of the earth: and in thy sorceries haue all na∣tions gone astray. And the light of a candle.The eternall darknesse and sorowfulnesse of Antichriste and his impes A. I haue told yée that the kingdom of Antichrist is darkesome, Héeretofore. 16. b. 10. By reason whereof Iohn saith it shall haue darknesse in sted of light: for the reprobates shal be cast at length into outward dark∣nesse, wheras shall be wéeping and gnashing of téeth. Ther∣fore like as she hath assayed all meanes possible to quench the light of the Gospell, that it should not shine vpon men: so also shall she hir selfe be bereft of light for euer, and be cast intoo horrible darknesse. And the voyce of bridegroome and bryde. &c. M. q. d. Wedding shal cease in thée: for no bridegroome shal marry any bride in thée. Or else the ioyes of mariage shall cease in thée, and nothing shall be heard in thée but wéeping and sobbing. A. Except any man had leuer to referre this too the bishop of Romes vayne bragging,The causes of the destru∣ction of Anti∣christ and his kingdome. wherethrough he vaū∣teth himselfe to be the bridegroome of Christes Churche, too Christs great dishonor. But he shall leaue that bragging, when he shall suffer extreame punishment as a most filthye and vncleane aduouterer. For thy Merchants were the greate men of the earth. G. The holy Ghost alledgeth in this place
thrée causes of the wasting of the Babylonish or Antichristi∣an kingdome.Couetous∣nesse. Of which, the first is vnsaciable gréedinesse of gaine, suche as they sée or rather féele at this day, whiche dwell vnder the tyrannie of Antichrist. For there be manye Merchants whiche surmount great princes in riches. But we speake chéefly of those, who (as saincte Peter saithe) do make merchandise euen of men, by their feyned wordes. 2. Pet. 2. a. 2.3.Superstitiō. And in thy sorceries. The second cause is hir sor∣cerie, which betokeneth hir superstitious religion, hir who∣rish doctrine, and hir miracles wrought by diuelish practi∣ses: according as we haue saide somewhat alreadye in the i∣mage of the beast, Héeretofore, 13 c. 14. A. Concerning whyche things looke also in Math. 24. b. 24. &. 1. Timo. 4. a. 1.2.3. and 2. Thessa. 2. c. 9.10. 24. And in hir vvas found the bloud of the Prophets and of the Saincts, and of all that haue bin slayne vpon the earth. And in hir was found the bloud. &c. M. Blud is put héere for bludshed.The sheding of innocent and giltlesse bloud. S. The thirde and chéefe cause of the destruction of Antichrists kingdom, is the shedding of giltlesse blud, name∣ly for religions sake and for their goodes, which are the cau∣ses for which the Romish bishop doth oftentimes make war himselfe, and stir vp others to do the same. And therfore shal they deseruedly héere this saying: All the righteous bloud that hath bin shed vpon earth from the bloud of righteous A∣bel to the bloud of Zacharie which was slayne betwéene the temple and the Altar, shall come vppon you. Math. 23. d. 35. A. Which thing would God that they would wey earnestly, who at this day in the papistry do for feare of men ratifye with their consente the sentence of death whiche is giuen a∣gainst ye godly martyrs of Christ, whereas neuerthelesse they be inwardly perswaded in themselues, both of the innocen∣cie of the parties, and also of the truth of ye doctrine for which they shed their bloud. Truly it is no light crime to deale cru∣elly
with Christes members, which is asmuch as to crucifye Christe in his members, and to fyght against the knowen truth. Such being more hurtfull than the president Pilate, are worthy to be left vp to a wicked minde, & to be cast with their prince Antichriste into vtter darknesse, except they re∣pent betimes and aske God forgiuenesse of so foule denial, or ather of so shamefull crucifying of Christ. For he cannot lye which said, whosoeuer is ashamed of me and of my sayings in this whorish and sinfull generation: of him also will the sonne of man be ashamed, when he commeth with his holye Angells in the glory of his father. Luke. 9. d. 26. The ninteenth Chapter. AFter this I heard a great noyse of much people in heauen, sayingPrayse the Lorde. Allelu-iah: Saluation, and ho∣nor, and glorye, and povver is [belonging] vnto the Lorde our God. AFter this I heard. A. After that Iohn hath spoken of the last and vttermost destruction of Anti∣christ:The contents of this chap∣ter. now consequently in this Chapter hée sheweth, that this victorye is to be attributed vnto Christ only, who hauing receiued al po∣wer of the father, which is only to be worshipped, calleth and incourageth all his seruāts to ye rooting out of them by whose craftie packings and froward errors the whole worlde hath bin blinded. Againe he declareth, that there is so horrible de∣struction prepared for all the vngodlye, that as many as serue God with an vncorrupt minde, may take occasion of singular gladnesse thereat. G. Then like as Daniell sawe, that after the beast was destroyed, the kingdome was con∣ueyed to the Lords Sainctes, who hauing bin partakers of Christes tribulations through faith, do now reigne with him: euen after the same manner doth Iohn shew the ioy & trium∣phing
whiche the faithfull shall make for the destruction of Antichrists kingdome. For like as by the destruction of the old Babylon, and by the sleaing of Baltazar the king therof by Cyrus king of Persia, the people of Israell had leaue gy∣uen them to retourne to Ierusalem, to build vp the Temple, and to carrie the vessels thereof home againe which the wic∣ked king had abused: Euen so when the spirituall Babylon is destroyed, and the child of damnation cleane rid out of the way, then shall the Churches be in peace, and the faithfull at rest, who shall be throughly fed with the pure word of God: then shall the spirituall Ierusalem be builded againe and the true Temple of God finished, (that is to say mens harts shal be clenzed by faith:) then shall the vessels of election whyche Antichrist had wickedly abused, be brought home agayne in∣to the Lords house. And then shall the voyce of mirth and sin∣ging be heard in heauen, that is to say in the congregation of the godly, for the victory obtained against that cursed harlot. A great noyse of much people.All the elect. M. That is to wit, of all the cho∣sen,The Church of God or the faithfull onely are meete set∣ters foorth of Gods praises. whose number is great if it be néerely vewed, as hathe bin said already Héeretofore. 7. c. 9. In heauen. That is to saye in the Church which is called the kingdome of heauen. Mat. 13. f. 47. For the prayses of God are heard peculiarly there, bycause the faithfull onely be méete setters foorthe of Gods glory. Wherevpon Dauid said, Reioice yée righteous in the Lord, praise is comly in the rightminded. Psal. 33 a. 1. Cōtra∣riwise, vnto the vngodly the Lord hath said, what hast thou to do with the telling of my statutes, or to take my couenant in thy mouth? Psalm. 50. c. 16. Saying Allelu-iah. S. This word Allelu-iah is an Hebrue word, whereby the godly do chéere vp one another, to set foorth the mighty prayses of God con∣tinually, according as it appéereth by the tytles of certayne psalmes. And this word is asmuch to say, as Praise yee the beer, or him that is of himselfe, Saluation, and honor, and glory. G. For this triumphant and ioyfull song looke before. 5. d. 13. &. 7. c. 12. And power belong vnto the Lord our God. This is ad∣ded
to teach the faithfull to father all victory vppon God,Al victorie must be impu∣ted to God. ac∣cording as the Apostle sayth; In all these things we get the vpper hand through him which hath loued vs. Rom. 8. g. 37. And agayne, Thanked be God who hath giuen vs the vpper hand through our Lord Iesus Christ. 1. Cor. 15. g. 57. 2. For true and rightuous are his iudgements, for he hath iudged the great vvhore vvhich marred the earth vvith hir setting of hir selfe foorth to sale, and hath a∣uenged the bloud of his seruants at hir hand. For true and rightuous. &c.A repetitiō of the causes of Antichrists confusion. M. God giueth that which he had promised, and rendereth to euery man according to his works. For he hath iudged the great vvhore, that is to say the Church of Antichrist, which sate as a Quéene, and comman∣ded all men at hir pleasure. Héeretofore. 18. b. 7. VVhich mar∣red the earth. S. Agayne he declareth the cause why the greate whore is condemned: namely bycause she made the whole earth a brothelhouse by hir superstitious and pestilent doc∣trine and also by the example of hir leawd life: besides hir sheading of giltlesse bloud as if it had bin but water, accor∣ding as is added immediatly,God will cer∣teinly auenge his elect. And hath auenged the bloud of his seruants. A. Like as Abels bloud which Cain had shed, cry∣ed from out of the earth: So also the bloud of the godly which is shed for the Gospels sake cryeth in the sight of the Lorde, to haue vengeance executed vpon the wicked persecuters of the Church: according as the Lord hath promised that he wil requite it. Deute. 32. e. 35. & Rom. 12. d. 19. Wherevpon Chryst said, Shall not God reuenge his chosen which crie vnto him day and night, euen when he hath borne with them. I say vn∣to you he will auenge them, and that shortly. Luke. 18. b. 7. Therefore let the godly be patient till the comming of the Lord. Iames. 5. b. 7.The godly are neuer wr o set∣ting foorthe Gods prases. 3. And agayne they sayde, Allelu-iah. M. This repe∣ting sheweth that the godly are neuer weerie of setting forth
Gods prayses.The endlesse damnation of the wicked. And the smoke thereof went vp for euermore. S. By this kinde of spéech, the scripture expresseth the endlesse peynes of the reprobates: wherof I haue spoken more large∣ly heeretofore, 14. c. 11. M. Therefore that whiche Iohn spea∣keth, is to this effect: as euerlasting as the prayse and glorye of the blissed men is in heauen: so euerlasting is the miserie and peine of the damned in Hell. B. Looke Esay. 66. g. 24. &. Math. 25. d. 41. & Mark. 9. g. 44. 4. And the four and tvventie elders and the foure beasts fell dovvne and vvorshipped God that sate on the Throne. A. Concerning the .24. elders and four beastes looke afore, 4. b. 4. Saying, Amen. M. That is to say, confirming the prayses of the godly saincts. Allelu-iah. That is to say, sin∣ging the same prayse togither whiche the others aforesayde sounded out. 5. And there vvent a voyce out of the Throne, say∣ing, giue prayse vnto our God all ye seruantes of hys, and ye that feare him both small and great. And there went a voyce out of the Throne. S. This voyce is thought to be the voyce of the Angels whiche exhort all the godly to be earnest in the setting foorth of Gods prayses. And ye that feare him.The feare of God. A. That is to saye, ye that worship him and serue him: for the feare of God is oftentimes taken for the whole seruis or religion of God, as hath bin saide alreadye héeretofore, 11. d. 18. Both small and great. B. That is to saye, as many of ye as serue god, sing ye foorth his prayses. The voice of all his chosen liketh him well, of what estate or degrée so euer they be.The greate. Those are saide to be great in the Churche, of whome the Apostle speaketh thus: we talke of wisedome a∣mong the perfect sort. 1. Cor. 2. b. 6. And the Lord saith, who∣soeuer doth these things and teacheth them, he shall be called great in the kingdome of heauen. Math. 5. c. 19. And those bée the smallThe small. of whome it is said, As vnto little ones in Chryst
I haue giuen you milke to drinke and not meate: for as yet ye were not strong, neyther are ye as yet. 1. Cor. 3. a. 2. 6. And I heard as it vvere the noise of much people, and as it vvere the noyse of manye vvaters, and as it vvere the noise of great thunderings, saying, Hallelu-iah. For the Lord our God reigneth almighty. And I heard as it vvere the noyse. S. Now are the liuing sort brought in singing a Caroll of victorye for the reigning of God. Whiche noise he compareth from time to time to the sound of many waters and thunders roaring a farre off. For the Lord our God reigneth. A. That is to say, the Lord our God hath gotten the kingdome or souereintie. Almightie. A. Con∣cerning this title looke afore. 1. b. 8. And héere séemeth to be a couert matching of contraries, betwéene the euerlasting reigne of God, and the reigning of men: as if the elect shoulde say, M. Heeretofore the vngodly reigned: but now shall the al∣mightie Lord our God reigne, destroying Antichrist and all his members. 7. Let vs be glad and reioyce and giue glory vntoo him. For the mariage of the Lamb is come, and hys vvise hath made hirselfe ready. Let vs be glad and reioyce. A. In these words Iohn doth (af∣ter a sort) erpresse the vnutterable ioy of the godly,The vnspea∣kable ioy of the godly. by vsing diuers words which signifye all one thing. And giue glory vn∣to him. The chéefe marke or drift of our reioycing is, to mag∣nify God with praises, and to yéeld all honor and glory vntoo him. Far other is the reioycing of the faithlesse, who dishonor God with their mouth and in their conuersation. For the ma∣riage. &c. G. This thing is done so oft as ye promises made by god in Christ, be receiued by liuely faith. And his wife. A. That is to say, ye Church of ye godly. For ther is but only one husbād of ye church,One husband of ye Church. namely euē Christ, as it is said in Mat. 9. b. 15. & in
Iohn. 3. d. 29. The Pope then is a blasphemer in boasting himselfe to be the husband of the Church. Hath made hirselfe rady.Of prepara∣tion. S. Longing with hartie and earnest desire, to enioy the imbracing of hir husband: according as it is written in Sa∣lomons Ballets. 1. a. 1. A. For Iohn alludeth to the custome of brides, which are brought in decked vnto their bridegroomes. So wrate Paule to the Corinthians, I am iealous ouer you with a godly ielosie: (for I haue cuppled you to one husband) that you should yeeld your selues a chast virgin vnto Christ. 2. Cor. 11. a. 2. S. Héerevnto belong the things that be written in Esay. 52. a. 1. &. 54. a. 1. &. 65. c. 17. &. 66. d. 12. A. Neuerthelesse this preparation which is treated of in this place, procéedeth not of ourselues, but of the méere grace of God, that is to wit by pleasing Christ our husband through faith. But faith is the gift of God, according as I haue shewed already in many places héeretofore, and also in the next verse following. 8. And it vvas giuen vnto hir to aray hirselfe in pure and bright cloth of reynes. For the cloth of reynes is that vvhich maketh the Saincts righteous. And it was giuen vnto hir. V. This verse confirmeth that which I said euē now: namely that the preparing or making ready of the bride, is the méere gift of God.Preparation is the mere gift of God. It was giuen vn∣to hir, saith he. M. S. q. d. It is not of hir owne nature, neyther hath she it by hir desertes, that she shoulde be accepted of hir bridegroome, but she hath it of Gods frée election and mercie. To aray hirselfe with pure and bright cloth of Reynes. G. By these wordes he betokeneth faith,Faithe. whereby men are made righteous before God and the hartes of them made cleane. Act. 15. b. 9.Christs righ∣teousnese, and the clothing of ourselues therewith It is pure and bright: for it vttereth itselfe by pro∣fession of mouth, and by louing of ones neighbour. Rom. 10. v. 10. & Gala. 3. a. 6. For the cloth of Reines is that which maketh the sainctes righteouse. B. q. d. The Cloth of Reynes betoke∣neth that thing whereby the saincts are made righteous and cleane before God. And that is the rightuousnesse of Christ,
which he imparteth to vs héere, and which is taken hold on by faith. G. Of this spirituall cleanesse the Apostle writeth in this manner: Men, Loue ye your wiues, as Christ hath lo∣ued his Church, and giuen himselfe for it, to make it holy by clenzing it in the Lauer of water through his word, that hée might deliuer hir to himself a glorious Church without spot or wrincle or any such kind of thing, but that she might be ho∣ly and vnblamable. Eph. 5. e. 25. And againe, as many of you as are baptised, haue put on Christ, Gal. 3. d. 27. Happie ther∣fore and blissed in all points are they to whome it is gyuen to be so clothed: for there shall no spot be séene in them in time to come in the Lords sight, but they shall be rewarded with the Robe of immortalitie in the world to come, as righ∣teous for Christs sake, & therfore also vnblamable: according as the Apostle witnesseth. Therfore sygh we (sayeth he) de∣siring to be clothed with our mansion which is from heauen, howbeit so as if we be found clothed and not naked. 2. Cor. 5. a. 2. Also, happie is he that watcheth and kéepeth his gar∣mentes, that hée walke not naked and haue his shame séene. Héeretofore. 16. c. 15. 9. And he sayde vnto me, VVrite, Blissed are they that be called to the supper of the Lambs mariage. And hee saide vntoo me: These are the true vvordes of God. And he said vnto me. S. It is to be marked héere, that the An∣gell which speaketh vnto Iohn in this place,A breef reher∣sall of things going afore. séemeth to bée the same Angell which had said vnto him, Come I will shew thée the damnation of the great whore, and the rest of the things that follow in ye first verse of ye seuentéenth Chapter. Also in the seconde verse of the eightéenth Chapter there is brought in another Angel crying with a loude voyce, Ba∣bylon is falne, is falne. &c. And also another voyce, saying: get ye out of hir my people and the rest of the things that follow in the .18. Chapter almost to the end of it. And about the ende
of it there is brought in an Angell which casteth a milstone into the Sea, saying, with such violence as this, shall Baby∣lon be throwen downe. &c. wherevpon hath followed a nois of harpes and voyces praysing God vnto this ninth verse of this nintéenth Chapter. It seemeth then that the same Angel which had shewed Iohn ye great whore, speaketh these things also and sheweth him also the bride of the Lamb. And there∣fore he séemeth to retyre héere to the Angells talke whyche was broken off afore in the .18. Chapter by stepping aside too declare certaine other things that came first in order. VVrite. M. That is to wit, to euerlasting remembrāce and the singu∣lar comfort of all the godly. Blissed are they that are bidden too the supper.Eternall life likened to a Supper and to a wedding feast. The Supper is the last meale of the day. Men in old time were wont to make finer chéere and more mirth at their suppers, bycause they might then giue themselues too rest after they had ouercome their labours, & set all cares a∣side. Furthermore, wedding feasts are wont to be best furni∣shed with deinties and plentie of all things, and also to be ful of all manner of mirth. Therefore the happinesse whiche the chosen shall enioy in time to come, is compared to a Supper, yea & to a mariage supper, and moreouer also to the Lambs supper: all whiche things haue a wonderfull augmentation. A. To expresse the greatnesse of the ioy which all the Saincts shall one day enioy with Christ. From this supper shall all such be thrust out (to their great shame) as shall be founde too come without their wedding garments. According as Christ sayth,Who be clo∣thed with the wedding gar∣ment. Math. 22. b. 12. They be clothed with this wedding gar∣ment, whiche haue put vppon them the Lord Iesus. Roma. 13. d. 14. and also the new man whiche is fashioned after God in righteousnesse and true holinesse. Eph. 4. b. 4. For lyke as a wedding garment betokeneth a mind chéerefully and re∣uerently disposed towards the wedding feast: euen so also by this wedding garment it is required that the guests shuld be such manner of persons as receiue the heauenly giftes with gladnesse, with reuerence of Gods maiestie, and wyth
thanksgiuing. And he sayd vnto me, these are the true wordes of God. S. Namely the words that I bade thée write euen now:The happi∣nesse of them that be saued. that is to wit, Blissed are they that are bidden▪ &c. q. d. These are not my words but Gods, and therefore they must néedes bee most true and certaine. For most certeinly blissed, yea treble and fourfold happie are they whiche are admitted vnto that great and euerlasting supper of the Lamb. For all earthly pleasures be flightfull: but the heauenly pleasures are euer∣lasting. Those satisfye not: but these yéeld suffizance to the full. Those bréede misliking after they haue bin had: but these heauenly ones please always alike. Those leade men to corruption: these preserue them from al corruption. Those are common to the bad as well as to the good: but these gyue the good men suffizance,Ministers and preachers must not speke of their owne head. and leaue the bad ahungred for e∣uer. A. And in thys place all preachers and ministers of Gods word are warned, that they speake not any thing in the Churche, saue that whiche is most true and certayne, that is to say, whiche procéedeth from God who cannot lye: according to this saying of the Apostle, if any man speake, let him speake as the wordes of God. 1. Pet. 4. c. 11. And so shall the wordes of the ministers be the wordes of God. 1. Thessa. 2. c. 13. 10. And I fell dovvne at his feete to vvorship hym. And he said vnto me, See thou do it not. I am a fellovv seruant of thine and of thy brethren vvhiche haue the record of Iesus. VVorship thou God. For the vvitnes∣sing of Iesus is the spirit of prophesie. And I fell downe at his feete. A.Against wor∣shipping of Sa nctes, and much more of Images. This place is worthy of sin∣gular marking. For it maketh very much to the reteyning of the lawfull seruing of God. When Iohn would haue wor∣shipped the Angell that informed him of these thinges, hée heard it said, See thou do it not. B. Worde for worde it is See, thou not. But the words do it are added to make the matter
more playne. I am a fellow seruant of thine and of thy brethren. q. d. Both I and thou and thy brethren are all seruauntes of that one Lord to whome all worship, honor, and glory is due. VVhich haue the record of Iesus. A. We will speake of this re∣cord anone hereafter. VVorship thou God. The Angell suffe∣reth not Iohn to worship him, & therof he alledgeth two cau∣ses. The one is that one seruant ought not to be worshipped of another seruant which is his felow. The other is, that the same seruis is due only vnto God. Euen so Peter suffereth not himselfe to bée worshipped of Cornelius. Stand vp (sayth he) for I my selfe also am a man. Acts. 10. d. 26. Also when Paule and Barnabas heard, that godly honor should be done vnto them, they tare their garmentes, and thrusting them∣selues into the preace, cried out and saide. Sirs, why doo yée thus? We being men also and subiect to the same miseries that you are, do giue you warning to turne from these vaine things to the liuing god. &c. Act. 14. b. 14. M. For thus is it writ∣ten: Thou shalt worship the Lorde thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue. Deute. 6. b. 13. & Math. 4. b. 10. S. Yet for all this, the Romish Antichrist, not only suffereth, but also com∣pelleth men to worship him, causing euen the greatest By∣shops, yea and euen the greatest princes to kneele downe too his féete and to kisse them. Furthermore also he graunteth pardons to such as knéele downe and worship at the tumbes and images of Saincts.Honoring, worshipping, and seruing. Neyther can they shift their hands of wicked idolatrie by their péeuish destinction, of Latria, Dulia, and Hyperdulia, as they tearme them, considering that the scriptur is vtterly vnacquainted with such maner of names and of those curious destinctions, as it appéereth by the fore∣saide saying of Christe. Thou shalt worship the Lorde thy God and hym onely shalte thou serue. Math. 4. b. 10. and Deuter. 6. c. 13. For Christe in that place setting aside all manner of fonde destinctions, chalengeth the honor of knée∣ling downe onely vnto God alone whereby we be put in mind to haue regarde of the matter, rather than of termes, as ofte as wee deale in the worshipping and seruyng
of God. If a mā nip off neuer so little of his glory to ascribe it to his creatures, it is a trayterous defacing of his honor. But it is too euident that men do so, when they thinke themselues beholden to any creature for the thinges whereof God will haue himselfe acknowleged to be the only author. And ther∣fore like as religiō is properly spiritual, and yet the outward profession of it belongeth to the body: euen so not only the in∣ward worshipping but also the outward witnessing of the same is due alonly vnto God. Vayne therfore or rather most wicked is the worshipping of Angels and Saincts, seing that the scripture teacheth vs most manifestly, that God alone is to be worshipped and he only to be serued. The Sainctes de∣ceased rest in peace with Christe, looking for the last day of the Resurrection, according as is saide héeretofore, 6. c. 9.10. As for the Angels,Angelles. they be heauenly spirites whiche do al∣wayes behold the face of the father. Math. 18 b. 10. Neuerthe∣lesse they be sent foorth about seruises, for their sakes whych shall be heires of saluation. Hebr. 1. d. 14. And therefore wor∣ship is not due vnto thē, but only to ye liuing God. For the wit∣nessing of Iesus is the spirit of prophesie. S.A comendatiō of this booke. This place maketh to the commendatiō of the prophesie of this booke, in asmuch as it registreth Iohn in the number, & (as it were) in the chec∣ker roll of his brethren the Prophets.The holie Ghost. And it is the spirite which beareth witnesse of the Lord Iesus in the law and the Prophets. Wherevpon Christ saith, he shall beare witnesse of me, and you also shall beare witnesse. &c. Iohn. 15. d. 26. Those therefore which beare witnesse of the Lord Iesus, are indued with the spirit of prophesie, acording as Paule saith: no man is able to say that Iesus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost. 1. Cor. 12. a. 3. And the Angels are said to be the fellow-seruants of the Prophets and of Christs witnesses, bycause that they also do acknowledge, professe and worship hym as Lord, and also teach and witnesse the same thing to bée done of others.
11. And I savv heauen open, and beholde a vvhite horse, and he that sate vppon him vvas called faithfull and soothfast, and by righteousnesse dothe he iudge and fight. Christs vic∣torie.And I saw heauen open. G Iohn addeth the victory whyche Christ had against Antichrist and hys members. The ope∣ning of heauen betokeneth héere (as in many other places) a fuller discouerie of Gods mysteries: or else that the whole earth shal be enlightned with brightnesse and glory, and that the day of iudgement shall be excéeding far brightest of all. And behold a white horse. A.Faithful prea∣chers, and mi∣nisters. By this white horse may be be∣tokened euery faithfull preacher of ye Gospell. Of which sort was Paul who was chosen for the nonce to carrie Chrystes name before nations & kings, & before the children of Israel. Acts. 9. c. 15. Which thing he performed chéerefully, according as he himselfe witnesseth, saying: I dare not speake any of those things whiche Christ hath not wrought by me to the o∣bedience of the Gentiles in word and déede through the po∣wer of signes and wonders, by the mightinesse of Gods spi∣rit, so as I haue filled all places with the Gospell of Chryste from Ierusalem and the Countries there abouts, euen vntoo Illyricum. Rom. 15. d. 18. 19. And the horse is saide héere to bée white, to shew the purenesse of life which must shine in ye mi∣nisters of ye word, so as they may be an example vnto others, according as Paule exhorteth his sonne Timothie. 1. Tim. 4 d. 12. Also Peter writeth to the Elders in this wise: not as executing Lordship ouer the Cleargie, but so as ye may bée a patterne to the flocke. &c. 1. Peter .5. a. 3. And he that sate vpon him. It appéereth manifestly by this description, that the Lord Iesus is meant by this horseman. He is called faithful bycause he fulfilleth his promise, so as he deceyueth no man. And soothfast.Soothfast. This is fitly veryfied of Christe: not only by∣cause he reporteth true things, but also bycause he is the verie truthe it selfe. Iohn 14. a. 6. And by ryghtuousnesse &c.
For he rendereth vnto euery man according to his workes. Heeretofore, 2. f. 23. And, fyght. Yea and luckely: according as it is sayde, The Lamb shall ouercome them. Héertofore. 17. d. 14. 12. His eyes vvereas a flame of fire: and vppon his head vvere many Crownes. and he had a name written vvhich noman knovveth but himselfe. His eyes were as a flame of fyre. S. It is a resemblance of a iudge that is angrye against the wicked,Christs in∣comparable power and myghte. and which preten∣deth vengeance euen by his very countenance. And on hys head vvere many Crownes. G. Christ is king of all worlds: and therefore the right of all kingdomes, yea and the victorye of all kings is in his hand. M. Moreouer it is he which crowneth the elect in much mercie and compassion. Psal. 103. a. 4. And Christ himselfe saith of himselfe: All power in heauen and earth is giuen vnto me. Math. 28. c. 18. VVhiche no man kno∣weth but himselfe. B. That is to say,Christs sin∣gular prehe∣minence and prerogatiue of honour. It is not due of right vntoo any but himselfe, no not euen to the Angels. For to which of ye Angels saide he at any time, Thou art my sonne, this daye haue I begotten thée. Heb. 1. b. 5. Furthermore no man dothe fully atteine vnto the maiestie & excellentnesse of this name, saue he alone. For the father hath giuē him a name aboue al names which are named, not onely in this world but also in ye world to come. Phil. 2. a. 10. &. Eph. 1. d. 21. Also, of this name it is said, whosoeuer calleth vpon the name of the Lord shall be saued. Ioel. 2. g. 31. & Rom. 10. c. 13. The vertue of this name is set foorth by Peter in these words. There is none other name vnder heauen giuen vnto men wherein we must bée saued. Acts. 4. b. 12. Or else, no man knoweth it but himselfe and he to whome it pleaseth him to declare it. Math. 11. d. 27. So said he also vnto Peter, flesh and bloud hath not shewed these thinges vnto thee, but my father whiche is in heauen. Mat. 16. c. 17. At a word, no mā knoweth ye vertue of Christs name, but by Christ.
13. And he vvas clothed in a garment stayned vvyth bloud: and his name is called the vvord of God. The worke of Christs passion.And he was clothed. M.A. This place is expounded diuersly. Some take the garment stayned with bloud to be the worke of Christes passion: other some refer it to the wounds whych (as men say) he will shew at the iudgement day. But Chryst is brought in simply héere,Christ a cham¦pion. as a stout conquerour of his eni∣mies. For he is likened to a knight that fyghteth stoutly in battell against his enimies, and beateth downe his foes in such wise, that his garmentes are all bestayned with theyr bloud.Christ God and man. And his name is called, the vvord of God, S. Which was in the beginning with God, and also is God himselfe, and be∣came flesh at the time apointed. Iohn. 1. a. 2. Neyther ceassed he for all this, to be the almightie power of God, whereby hee created and gouerneth all things, where against no creature is able to resist.The autho∣ritie of the Gospel. M. And it is to be noted, that euen the selfsame person which created the world, shall also iudge the worlde: namely the word of God. A. Like as Christ himselfe saythe, The word that I haue spoken is it that shal iudge you in the last day. C. And truly the authoritie of the Gospell coulde not haue bin aduaunced with a more excellent commendation, than by putting ouer vnto it the power of iudging. For ac∣cording to these words, the last iudgement shall be nothyng else but an auowing of the doctrine of the Gospell. Indeede Christ himselfe shall get him vp into the iudgement seate: but yet he assureth vs; that hée wyll giue sentence by the word that is preached now. This declaration must néedes strike the vngodly in extreame feare, séeing that they whych do now beare themselues so proudly against ye doctrine of his Gospell, cannot escape the iudgemente of the same. Agayne, hereby there redoundeth inestimable cōfort to the godly, that howsoeuer they be as now condemned by the world, they are out of all doubt acquit in heauen, bycause that wheresoe∣uer the beléefe of the Gospell is settled, there is Goddes
iudgement seate erected to saue them. Vpon assurance of this condition, there is no cause why wée should passe for the Pa∣pistes with their vntoward verdites: bicause our faith moū∣teth euen aboue the Angells. BV. Therefore let vs beare this geere in mindfull hart and remembrance, and let vs beware that wée despyse not the Lorde when he speaketh too vs in his Gospell. 14. And the vvarryers vvhich are in Heauen follo∣vved him vpon vvhite horses, clothed vvith vvhite and pure Reynes. And the warryers which are. &c.The mini∣sters of the Gospel. M. This noble armie betoke∣neth the heauenly spirites and all the faithfull whiche haue fought ageinst the diuell and Antichrist, by preaching & tea∣ching in the Churche. So is Christ described too come in hys Maiestie and all his Angells with him. Math. 25. c. 31.32. S. For this cause he is called in the scriptures, Adonai Sabbaoth, that is too say, the Lord of hostes,The Lorde of hostes. bicause all the warryers of Hea∣uen serue vnder him at his commaundement, as it is writtē in Daniel. 7. c. 10. and heretofore. 5. c. 11. Suche an armie dyd the Lad of Eliseus the Prophete sée. 2. Kings. 6. d. 17. Vppon white horses; clothed with white and pure reynes. These whyte horses and this cloth of Reynes are a token of victorie. 15. And from his mouth vvent a sharpe svvorde too smyte the Heathen vvithall: And he shall rule them vvith a rod of yron, and he treadeth the vvyne fat of the feercenesse and vvrath of almightie God. And from his mouth. &c. S. By the sharpe swoordeSword. is ment strength and force of armes, wherby he is able too execute his iust iudgement: which thing rightuous iudges want nowe and then: whereof yée haue a larger discourse heretofore, 1 c. 16. where the same sentence is set downe. To strike the heathenHeathen. withall. A. That is too saye, too take horrible vengeance of the heathen. S. And by the name of heathen, he meaneth all sortes
of men that leade their life after a heathenishe maner. Con∣cerning whom looke, Eph. 2. c. 11. and .4. d. 17. and .1. Thess. 4.1.5. & .1. Petr. 4. a. 3. and also in the .xxvj. and .xxvij. verses of the second Chapter heretofore. And he shall rule them wyth a rod of yron.Iron mace. B. By the yron rod he betokeneth the vnbendable and vtterly vnbowable Scepter of Christes Kingdome, ageynst the which it is not lawful too match any aduersarie power at all. Whereof looke in the Psalm. 2. c. 9. & .55. a. 4. & .110. a. 2. and heretofore.Wynelat of Gods wrath. 2. g. 27. And he treadeth the winefat of the fercenesse, &c. G. That is too say, Christ is he which taketh vengeance of all such as haue stubbornly withstoode the word of God. And Iohn séemeth too haue had an eye too the vengeance whyche God threateneth by hys Prophet too lay vpon the Edomites Esai. 63. a. 1. 16. And on his garment and on his thigh he hathe a name vvritten, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Christ is the only soueraine of heauen and earth.And on his garment. S. Onely Christ is the King of all ages, and souereine Lord of the whole world. In vaine haue they chalendged, and in vaine shall they chalendge thys style, as manie as haue heretofore or shall héereafter clayme it. A. For Christ is onely he too whom the same agréeth truely. For of him onely hath the father sayde, I haue appoynted him my king vpon Sion the hil of my holinesse. Psalm. 2. b. 6. S. More∣ouer he hath this style written on his thygh, bycause he wyll stretch out the souereintie of his reigne vntoo posteritie, bée it neuer so farre off.The Thigh. For by the thigh is betokened posteritie in the Scriptures. Gene. 24. a. 2.9. Paule the Apostle giueth the same style vntoo God the father. 1. Timo. 6. c. 15. whereby it is gathered,Christ is very God. that Christ also is verie God, too whom the same tytles of Maiestie are gyuen which are attributed too God the father.
17. And I savve an Angell standing in the Sunne: and he cryed vvith a loud voyce, saying too all the foules that flevv throughe the middes of the Heauen▪ Come and gather your selues togither too the Supper of the great God. 18. That yee may eate the fleshe of Kings, and the fleshe of high Captaines, and the fleshe of mightie men, and the fleshe of horses and of suche as sit vpon them, and the flesh of all freemen and bondmen, and of smal and great. And I saw an Angell standing.The destruc∣tion of Anti∣christ and his hangers on. G. Now by a certein person fei∣ning, Iohn describeth the horrible killing and excéeding great slaughter which shall bée made in Antichristes Kingdome, at such time as Christ shall chalenge the Kingdome which that tyrant had vsurped. Of which destruction the Prophets haue spoken vnder sundrie figures, lyke as Esai. 63. a. 3. vnder the the figure of Edom. Ezechiell vnder the names of Gog and Magog, Ezech. 38. a. 2. & .39. b. 6. Daniel speaking of the King of the North, Daniel. 11. c. 13. And Zacharie. 14. a. 4. S. For al these places agrée vpon the excéedyng great slaughter of the hoste of Antichriste, out of whose hande Chryst will recouer his Kingdome. Standing in the Sunne. •. Sith that the Angell is aboute too speake too all the byrdes of Heauen,Christs faith∣full ministers. that is too saye, whiche flye in the ayre, he is ryghtly reported too stand in the Sunne, that is too say in the middes of the cope of hea∣uen, too the ende he may the easlyer bée herde of them all. Neuerthelesse thys Angell maye betoken all Ministers of the worde which haue continued in the truthe, notwythstan∣dyng Antichrystes deceytes. These with a loud voyce, call the reste of the faythfull too the setting foorth of Gods pray∣ses: whome they call byrdes or foules of heauen, bycause their conuersation is heauenly. For they haue the wings of faith & charitie, wherwith they labor continually to flie to the
kingdome of heauen.The godly shall delyght in the execu∣tion of Gods iust vēgeāce. That yee may eate the fleshe of kings and of high Capteines. &c. M. That is too say, that yée may take de∣light and pleasure at Gods iustice in the punishment of the wicked, as well of the greate ones, (that is too wit, of Anti∣christ and his impes) as also of the little ones, that is too wit, of such other as shall bée damned, A. For too eate the fleshe of Kings. &c. is too like well of the Iustice which the Lorde shall execute ageinst them and al the enemies of the truth: accor∣ding as Christ sayd to his Disciples, you also shall set vpon xij. seates too iudge the twelue tribes of Israel. Mat. 19. d. 28. 19. And I savv the beast, and the Kings of the earth, and their vvarryers gathered together too make bat∣tell ageinst him vvhich sate on the horse, and ageinst his armie. And I sawe the beast. G. Here Iohn speakes openly of the de∣struction of Antichristes kingdome,The stubbor∣nesse of the reprobates a∣gainst Christ, & their vtter destruction. which shall bée séene then most, when the childe of damnation shall fight moste egerly & cruelly ageinst Christ. A. For no man euer yet fought lucke∣ly, neither shall any man euer fight luckely, ageinst him vn∣to whom all power is giuen both in heauē and earth, and vp∣on whom also attend all the hostes of heauen, and yet he is a∣ble to doo all things of himselfe alone. Ageinst him which sate on the horse. M. That is, ageinst Christ. A. The enemies of the truth imagine that they haue to doo with none but mē: wher∣as in very déede they make warre ageinst Christ, the Sonne of God. For thus sayth Christ vntoo Saul, when he persecu∣ted the Church: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou mée? Acts. 9. a. 4.The maner how the faith∣ful must fyght against An∣tichrist. And ageinst his armie. S.G. Héere wée sée howe the sayde battell is fought vnder the standard of our Lorde Christ gar∣ded with the host of Heauen, and that the victorie also is his▪ so as it is in vaine to prepare any swordes of our owne vnto this slaughter, other than the sworde of the spirite, which is Gods word, according too the Apostle Paules saying, Eph. 6. c. 17. S. Whervnto also this séemeth to belong inespecially, He
that leadeth intoo captiuitie shall bée led intoo captiuitie him∣selfe, and he that sleaeth with the sword must bée slaine with the sword also. Heretofore. 13. c. 10. Which thing (alas for so∣row) euen our dayes haue séene, when such as gloried of the Gospel, assayling others vpon trust of their owne armor and multitude, haue bin slaine themselues. A. Not that the vse of weapons is vtterly vnlawfull, but bycause that too ouercome and put to flight the enemyes of the truth of the Gospell, wée had néede cheefely of spirituall armour and weapon, namely of prayer, fasting, earnest amendment, and the spirituall sword of Gods word. 20. And the Beaste vvas taken, and vvith him the false Prophet vvhich vvrought myracles before him, vvhereby he deceyued them that receiued the beastes marke, and vvhich vvorshipped his image. These tvvo vvere cast aliue into the pond of fire that burneth vvith brimstone. And the beast was taken.The finall de∣struction and damnation of Antichrist & his fauorers and maintei∣ners. A. Nowe is described the victorie of Christ whiche shall slea the vngodly with the breth of hys mouth. 2. Thes. 2. b. 8. By the beast wée vnderstand Antichrist himselfe togither with his chosen Princes, whom he leaneth vntoo: and by the false Prophet wee vnderstande the setters forth of his kingdome and authoritie, and his craftsmaisters of lyes, by whose iuglingtricks the world was deceiued, as it is sayd afore. 16. c. 13.14. All these shall bee cast Aliue intoo the pond of fyre that burneth with brimstone. He could haue said in one word, They shall bée cast intoo euerlasting fyre, or intoo Hel fire. But it lyked him too inhaunce the destruction of An∣tichrist and his false Prophete with other wordes, bycause it is a terribler thing too bée so tormented alyue, than singly too bee slaine with ye sword. And iustly in good sooth are they ser∣ued so, bycause they be wittingly & willingly against Christ, and haue wrested too their owne glorie and behoofe, the scrip∣tures
which are manifestly spoken of the kingdom of Christ. Herewithal, it standeth with good right, that such as haue tor∣mented the preachers of the Gospell and other faithfull folks by putting them quicke into the fire too bée burnt, should also bee burned aliue themselues, so as their punishment myght after a sort be answerable to the greatnesse of their fault. And héere séemeth to be a certein allusion, to the horrible destructi∣on of Coree and his companie, wherof Moses maketh mēti∣on in the booke of Numbers. 16. e. 31.32. 21. And the remnant vvere slaine by the svvorde of him that sat vpon the horse, vvhich svvorde proceeded out of his mouthe, and the foules vvere filled full vvith their fleshe. The easyer damnattion of the rest of the vngodly.And the remnant. &c. G. By these wordes he doth vs too wit, that the residue shall bée subiecte too easyer punishmentes. q.d. Like as they be put to sorer paines, which be burned quicke, than they that be slaine by the sword: euen so the paine of An∣tichrist and his Apostles shall surmount the paynes of all o∣ther damned persons. M. Yet for all that, Those that haue bin seduced by them, and haue not repented them of their errors, shall suffer euerlasting peynes though somewhat easyer. For thus sayth the Scripture concerning the righteous and vn∣righteous, These shall go intoo euerlasting paines, and the rightuous intoo euerlasting life. Math. 25. d. 46. VVhich sword proceedeth out of his mouth.Gods word. It is a terming of the Lords word by a larger phrase. By the power wherof the wicked shall pe∣rish as hath bin often said alreadie.

That is to say, all Gods cho∣sen people were delighted with the punishmente of them. A. Which ioyning is matched with the full redemption that they had alwayes looked for.

The twentith Chapter. AND I savve an Angell come dovvne from Hea∣uen, hauing the key of the bottomlesse pit, and a great cheine in his hand. ANd I saw an Angell come. &c.Christ hath the Diuell in subiection so as he is able to do nothing without his laeue. A. The néerer that the day of iudgemēt approcheth, so much with the greater assaultes shall Sathan set vppon Christes Churche too oppresse it vtterly. But Christ the husband of the Churche and the so∣uerein king of all, shall set hir at full libertie at the day of the Resurrection, and take horrible vengeance of hir enemies, ac∣cordyng as Iohn sheweth in this Chapter. This Angell be∣tokeneth Christ, who is that strong knight of whō it is saide, If a stronger than he doo come vpon him and ouercome him, he wyll take away all his armor, wherin he did put his trust &c. Luke. 11. c. 22. M.A. He is sayd too come downe from heauen, bycause he shall come in the selfe same wise that he was séen too go vp intoo Heauen. Acts. 1. b. 11. Hauing the kye of the bot∣tomlesse pit. M. That is too say, hauing power ouer the bottom∣lesse pittes, that is too wit ouer the Diuels, who doo nothing but by the commaundement and wil of God. And a great chein in his hand. That is too say, an vneschewable puissance, wher∣by all the Féendes are bounde in the working of all the ser∣uices which they haue power to doo. 2. And he toke the Dragon that old Serpent vvhich is the Diuell and Satanas,The names of the wicked feend. and he bounde him a thou∣sand yeeres. And he tooke the Dragon. G.S. Satan is called héere a Dra∣gon, the olde Serpente, and the Diuell, to the ende that the heaping vppe of these reprochefull names maye expresse
the force, desirousnesse, and indeuor of the wicked Féendes too destroy all maner of men. For he is called a DragonA Dragon. by rea∣son of his spytefulnesse too doo mischiefe: as it appéereth by the things that are spoken heretofore, 12. a. 3. 4. 9. Ageine he is called a SerpentA Serpent. by reason of his wylinesse in deceiuing: for of al liuing creatures a Serpent is slyest or suttlest by nature Gene▪ 3. a. 1. In respecte whereof Christ willeth vs too bée as wise as Serpents. Math. 10. c. 16. And vntoo Serpent here is added Olde, bycause that beside his said naturall slynesse, he groweth continually in more craftinesse by reasō of his prac∣tize and experience of many things. M. For euen from the be∣ginning of the world vntoo this day, he hath euer bin giuen to sundrie shiftes of suttletie. VVhiche is the Diuell. The greeke worde DiabolosDiabolos. or Diuell. (which wée call a Diuell) signifieth a slaun∣derer or backbyter. A. For this enemie is sayd to bée an a∣ser of the brethrē, blaming them and finding fault with them day and night in the presence of our God. Heretofore. 12. c. 10. And Satanas.Satanas. That is too saye a foe, or aduersarie: namely by∣cause he is alwayes and in all things ageinst Chryst. Looke Math. 4. b. 3.6.9. And he bound him. S. That is too say, he berest him of his former power.The error of the Chiliastes or Thousan∣ders. For a thousand yeeres. Héere the in∣terpreters varie verie muche. First there were a Sect called Chiliastes or Thousāders, who vpō this present place & vp∣on diuers other of the Prophets haue written, that after the ful accomplishment of sixe thousand yéeres from the creation of the world, Antichrist and all his whole Kingdome (that is too say, all the wicked) should be vtterly destroyed: and that af∣terward in the seuēth thousand of yéeres, Christ should haue a most peaceable reigne with his electe vpon earth. Whych thousand yéeres béeing expyred, Satan shoulde bée let looce a∣geine for a little while before the iudgement, and then soone after, Christ should come too execute his last iudgement. But the fathers haue made this error too bée ynough hissed at: and moreouer the verie account of the times declares it too haue bin but a fond surmize of men. Secondly, Austin in ye seuenth
chapter of his twentith booke of the Citie of God, and Beda following him, vnderstand them eyther too bee the remuant of the sixe thousand yéeres wherein Christ was borne (for he is reported too haue bin borne in the fiue thousande one hun∣dred fourescore and nineteenth yéere after the creation of the world, and so there remained eight hundred and one yéeres of the sayde sixe thousande) so as the said remnant (by putting a part for the whole) shuld be called héere a ful thousand yeeres, in whyche the Churche came too hir full growth vnder the Apostles and holie Fathers, Satan béeyng yet tyde vp: Or else too bée all the yéeres that this worlde shall induce, from the tyme that Sathan was tyde vp by Chryst.The fond glo∣sing of the flse prophet Ihon of Viterb, to fl tter ye Pope and the Em∣perour. Iohn of Vi∣terb a Diuine, wryting vppon the Apocalips, vntoo Sirtus the fourthe Byshop of Rome of that name, warranteth the Byshop and the Emperour of Rome victorie ageinst the Sarzins, and a reformation of all Churches in the whole worlde, and an obedience too the Sea of Rome too indure a thousande yéeres full: and that afterwarde Satan shall bee let loose ageine, and the remnant of the Sarzins which were fled too the Nations of Gog and Magog, beeyng growen a∣geyne vntoo a great multitude, shall at length breake out a∣geyne: according as shall bée sayde in the eyghte verse of this Chapter. Moreouer the same Iohn of Viterbe behygh∣teth the foresayde victorie ageynste the Sarzins, from the yéere of our Lorde a thousand foure hundred fourescore and one, vnder the seuenth Emperour of the Turkishe Otoman∣nes, who reygned at that tyme in Turkie: and he surmy∣seth him too bée the seuenth King of whom Sainct Iohn hath spoken héeretofore in the tenth verse of the seuenteeth chap∣ter, bycause that when he commeth he muste tarye but a shorte tyme. But the falling oute of the matter hathe pro∣ued thys Ihon of Viterb too bée a false Prophete, and that he wrate but hys owne dreames, and so consequently that all the things are vayne whyche he hath set downe in this be∣halfe. Furthermore, there haue bin some which haue made
Calixt the second Byshop of Rome of that name, the Angell which in this Chapter hath the key of the bottomlesse pit: And Henrie the fifth Emperor of that name, the Dragon, as Ly∣ra hath done.Henrye the fourth Empe∣rour of that name. Some wryte that the fourthe Henrie was the Dragon: whome Calixtus compelled by hys manaces of ex∣communication, too releace hys custome of inuesting By∣shops and Abbottes, whiche the Emperours had hild by the space of thrée hundred yeares and more, euen from the time of Charles the great, whiche authoritie had béene graunted hym by Adrian the Pope in a Counsell hilde at Rome, as it is written in the Chronicles of Sigisbert.See the fonde fatterie of the Popish expo∣sitors. Also there haue béen some whiche haue made the sayde Angell too bee Pope Incent the thirde of that name, who ratifyed the orders of the Dominike Friers and Frauncis Friers, by whose lyfe and doctrine it is supposed, that the power of the Diuell shoulde bée tyed vp tyll the tyme of Antichryst. But the thou∣sande yeares must bée taken from the firste springing vp of Chrystes Kingdome,How the thou¦sande yeeres are to be vn∣derstoode a∣right. that is too wit, from the preaching of the Apostles, whereby the Gospell of Chryst grewe apace throughe the whole worlde, as it appéereth by Roma. 15. d. 19. and Coloss. 1. a. 6. & Acts. 1. b. 8. Vntyll suche time as partly the Empyre of Mahumet, but chéefely the supremacie of the Romishe Byshop, began too rage with open force for the mayntenance of theyr owne lawes and ordinances, ageynst Chrystes Gospell and ageynst all godly folke: whych thing wée are sure hathe béen done nowe these fiue hundred yéeres or there aboutes, both by the Antichrist of the East, and also by the Antichryste of the West. For before that tyme, al∣thoughe the Emperours shewed great crueltie: yet notwith∣standing for as much as Satan was yet tyed vp, it is a won∣der too héere howe greatly Religion increased, so as theyr myndes coulde not bée plucked awaye from Chrystes Gos∣pell. Neyther coulde they bée plucked awaye afterwarde, when dyuerse heresies grewe vp, no nor yet at the first en∣terance of the tyrannie of eyther of the Antichrystes: till at
length when the naughtinesse of men grewe too strong, in so much as Sathan was let loose by Gods ryghtful iudgement, than fayth began too fayle, and charitie too wex colde, so as in processe of tyme, there remayned scarce so much as a certein thin shadowe of those vertues, accordyng as this present day witnesseth. 3. And he cast him into the bottomlesse pit, and shet him vp, and set a Seale vpon him, that he shoulde not deceiue the people any more, till the thousand yeeres vvere fulfilled: and after that, he must be let looceSome reade, for a smal tyme. a little vvhile. And he cast him intoo the bottomlesse pit, and shet him vp, and set a seale vpon him. &c. S. That is to saye, he restrained him,The diuell is hilde shorte at Gods plea∣sure, and can doe nothyng till hee haue leaue. & bereft him of his power, that he should not deceiue those whō else he would haue done. For his hart would haue serued him too seduce all Nations, and to hold them still in the pestilent errors of Idolatrie, yea and in all kinde of horrible misdeedes. But God hath plucked thē out of the power of darknesse, and remoued thē into the kingdome of his deer beloued son, Colss. . b. 13. Till the thousand yeeres be fulfilled. M That is too say, till Antichrist bée come. And after that, he must bee let looce. This thyng came too passe after that the Dominion as well of Mahumet as of the Romishe Byshoppe was so increased in strengthe, that they became terrible too all Kings and Princes of the Earthe, for as muche as they were a∣ble, not onelye too gréeue them when they lysted, but al∣so too caste them from theyr seates, and too treade them quyte vnder foote, vntyll they submitted their neckes too false Religion and ryghtlesse Lawes: whyche thyng is doone yet still at thys daye, accordyng as Paule foretolde. 2. Thess. 2. b. 11. Therefore too bee let loose is too haue leaue too vse his owne force too the seducing of muche people,The tyme of the diuels ty∣rannie is but short. lyke as too bée tied vp is to haue no leaue giuen him. A little whyle. A. This sentence agrèeth with ye which we haue séen where Iohn said,
wo bée too the inhabiters of the Land and Sea, for the Diuel is come downe to you, and is sore angrie bycause he knoweth he hath but a short tyme. Heretofore. 12. b. 12. which short time or little whyle, must bée vnderstoode in this wyse: namely that euen in the middes of his practizes, when he thinketh all things safe on his side, then shal his course bée stopped, and he himself bée broken all to péeces. 4. And I savve Seates, and they sat vpon them, and iudgement vvas giuen vntoo them: and [I savve] the soules of them that vvereSome reade, which were slain with the sword. beheaded for the vvit∣nesse of Iesu, and for the vvorde of God, and vvhich had not vvorshipped the Beast, nor his Image, nor re∣ceyued his marke in their foreheades or in their hands: And theySome reade, shall liue and shall reigne. lyued and reigned vvith Christ a thou∣sand yeeres. And I sawe seates. &c. G. Here Iohn describeth largely the time that Satan was bound:The faithful reigne with Christ both heere and in heauen. for these things are set down by backereckening. For after he had sayd that the Diuell was tyde vppe a thousande yéeres: he retyreth backe, and shew∣eth what the Churche doothe in those yéeres. The state whereof he lykeneth to the state of a Kingdome or Common weale, setting downe the faythfull sorte as iudges of the world that minister ryght too all men in the tyme of peace. Therefore the setting forth of Seates and their sitting down vppon them, is as much too say as this that followeth, name∣ly, They lyued and reygned with. &c. For albeit that vntoo the eyes of fooles they séemed too dye: yet notwythstanding they bée in peace, and reygne happily all the whyle with Christ. Also the Churche reygneth wyth Chryste in the meane while, accordyng too this saying of the Apostle, The spirituall mā iudgeth all things, & he himselfe is iudged of no mā. 1. Cor. 2. d. 15. Furthermore the godly do euen thē most reygne, whē they are thought least too reigne, namely when they suffer punishmente for Christes sake, lyke as Chryst himself reig∣ned
euen vpon the Crosse. After this maner doth the Churche also pray, that Christ alone may reigne in vs, to the vtter de∣struction of the kingdome of Satan and Antichrist, saying: Thy kingdome come. Math. 6. b. 10. 5. But the residue of the deadSome reade, shal not liue againe. liued not ageine, vntill the thousande yeeres vvere finished. This is the first resurrection. But the residue of the deade. &c. N.Who liueth and who is dead. This place must bée vn∣derstood of the death of the soule which commeth through sin: & the thousand yéeres of present life do represent the Church or Kingdome of Christ. And of the same thousande yeeres is ment thys saying of Christ, The houre will come, and it is e∣uen now, that the dead shall héere the voyce of Gods sonne, and they that héere it shall liue. Iohn. 5. d. 25. B. And those bee deadolke, of whom it is saide, let the deade burie their deade. Mat. 8. d. 22. Also, vp thou that sléepest, and arise from ye dead, and Christ will inlyghten thée. Ephe. 5. c. 14. And ageine, thou hast the name to bee aliue, & art dead Heretofore, 3. a. . Ther∣fore if a man héere Christes voyce in this present life, that is too say, if he receiue it in his mind and beléeue it in his hart, he is passed alreadie from death vntoo life, & shall not dye for euer. Iohn. 5. d. 24. & 11. b. 26. But he yt despiseth it, abydeth in death. Rightly therefore doth Iohn saye in this place, But the residue of the deade. Wherby he meaneth that some are come ageyne too lyfe, and some not: namely not they which haue worshypped the Beaste and his image, and receyued hys marke. &c. For these haue not rysen ageyne too newnesse of lyfe by faythfull repentance, whych is the first Resurrection. Vntill the thousande yeeres were finished.The death of the wicked is endlesse. When they lyued in this present lyfe, they rose not ageyne from the death of sinne vntoo newnesse of lyfe, by repentance, and so consequently they wyll neuer reuyue ageyne from sinne, and therfore also neuer reuyue ageyne to the glorie of the blissed lyfe. Where∣fore the word Vntil in this place (like as in many other places
of scripture) betokeneth an endlesse time, like as also in Mat. 5. d. 18. and. 13. d. 30. and. 1. Cor. 15 d. 25. and Gal. 3 c. 19. This is the first Resurrection.The fyrst re∣surrection and the fyrst death Namely, that whereby wée ryse from the death of sinne, through repentance and fayth in Christ, accor∣dyng too this saying of Paule, lyke as Christ is rysen by the glorie of the father, so let vs walke in newnesse of life. Rom. 6. a. 4. For the first death is Sinne, whereby the soule dyeth, accordyng too the Lordes saying, In what day so euer thou eate of it, thou shalte dye the death. Gene. 2. c. 17. Whervpon insueth the death of the bodie. For by one man sinne entered intoo the worlde, and by sinne, deathe. Roma. 5. b. 12. Then like as the first death is the death of the spirite, when a man is dead from ryghtuousnesse and alyue too sinne, which thing is the reygning of deathe in the Soule of the vnbeleeuers: so the first Resurrection is when the man is deade vnto sin and alyue vntoo vnryghtuousnesse, throughe the spirite of Chryst whych reygneth in hym. For he that hath Christes spirite (whiche is the spirite of holynesse) can not dye: but standeth vp by and by by faythe and lyueth, and walketh in good workes, which are the fruites of the holie Ghost. A. Like as Paule saythe, wée bée his woorke, created in Christ Iesus vntoo the good woorkes whiche God hathe prepared for vs too walke in. Ephe. 2. b. 10. G. The vngodly shall not bée partakers of this holie Resurrection, bycause theyr consciences bée e∣uermore defyled wyth sinne, whyche is the deadly poyson of the Soule. And althoughe the faythfull bée deade by sinne, yet lyue they by faithe. The intent why these things are spo∣ken, is least anye man myght extende these things too the second Resurrection, whych shall bée common as well too the vngodly as to the godly: according as it is written in Daniel 12. a. 2. & in Iohn. 5. e. 29. & in Act. 24. d. 15.
6. Blissed and holie is he that hath part in the firste Resurrection, in these the second death hath no power for they shall be the Priestes of God and of Christ, and shall reigne vvith him a thousand yeeres. Blissed. S. That is too saye,Who be blis∣sed. he is blissed which kéepeth him∣self that which he is by newbirth, that is too wit, which conti∣nueth in walking in newnesse of life: according too ye whych Chryst sayth, Blissed are they that héere the word of God, and kéepe it. Luke. 11. d. 28. A. Also, blissed is he too whom the Lorde imputeth no sin, and in whose hart there is no guyle. Psalm. 32. a. 1.2. and Roma. 4. b. 8. And holie.Who be holy. Namely he is borne a∣gein by the word of life, & halowed, that is to say made cleane by Christs spirit, and so is become the dwelling place of God. In respect wherof Paule calleth them holie which are borne agein through the fountaine of life. Rom. 1. a. 7. & 1. Cr. 1. a. 2. A. For the chosen héere howe the Lord sayth, Bée ye holy as I am holie. Leui. 11. g. 44. &. 1. Pet. 1. c. 16. Also, God hath not cal∣led vs too vncleannesse, but too holinesse. 1. Tessa. 4. b. 7. He that hath parte in. &c. S. By thys woorde Parte, he séemeth too meane the first fruites of the holye Ghost, in respecte of the tenthes and of the whole croppe that shal be obteined in time too come. In these the second death hath no power. M.Ouer whome damnation hath no po∣wer. That is too say, euerlasting damnation which shall bée both in soule and bodie togither. For the second death is the damning of mē vn∣to Hell fire, according to this saying of our Sauyour, feare ye him who after he hath killed, is able to destroy both body and soule into hell fire. Math. 10. d. 28. Also, whomsoeuer this stone falls vpon, it shall grind him too poulder. Math. 21. d. 44. Like as the second Resurrection is of the godly, wherthrough their bodyes rise ageyn to immortall life: according as Paul saith, This corruptible must put on vncorruption, and this mortal must put on immortalitie. 1. Corin. 15. g. 53. A. And ageyn, wée wait for our sauiour the Lord Iesus Christ, who will trans∣form our vile bodies, that he may make it like in shape vntoo
his owne glorifyed bodie.The second death. &c. Phi. 3. d. 20.21. G. Or else ye second death is the death of the bodie, which can hurt none but onely those yt are dead of the first death, that is too wit in sin: that is to say, which liue not in Iesu Christ, who only is able to take away the venim of death. For ye reprobates, who begin their hel in this world, & whose consciences are continually gnawē and tormented with the worme that dieth not, are said to bée dead alreadie in spirit: but the horriblenesse of their torments shall increase when they bée departed out of this life. For this cause is the death of the reprobates called, in this chapter, the second death.The second Resurrection. And like as the second death can hurt none but only the reprobates or castawayes: (for vnto the chosē it is a certein enterance into eternall life) euē so the second resurrec∣tion, (which is the rising agein of the body,) abideth only thē that are risen frō the first death, (which is to be dead in sin,) that is to say, which are borne ageine and renued by the holie Ghost. For (as the prophet saith) they shal become Gods peo∣ple which are found written in the booke of life, & many of thē that sléepe in the dust of the earth shal be wakened: some to e∣ternall life, & othersome to euerlasting reproche and shame, Dan. 12. a. 2.Who be preestes. For they shalbe the Preests of God and of Christ. By these words he giueth an incling (although it be but bréefly & glauncingly) first that Christ is God, saying that they bée the Priests of God & of Christ, that is to say, of the father and the sonne, howbeit that Christ also (in respect yt he is the sonne of man) be a préest for euer: and secondly that the thing which is spokē héere, belongeth not onely vnto thē that are called By∣shops & préests at this day in the Church: but like as wée call beléeuers Christians by reason of their misticall anoynting: so also are they all Priests bycause they bée the members of the only Préest. Concerning which matter looke, heretofore. 1. b. 6. & .5. c. 10. And shal reigne with him a thousand yeeres. G. That is to say, time without ende. For the number of a thousande consisteth of many tennes multiplied tgher, and the num∣ber of ten is the number of perfection.
7. And vvhen the thousand yeeres are expired, Sa∣tan shall be loosed out of his prison. 8. And hee shall go out to deceiue the people that are vppon the foure quarters of the earth, [euen] Gog and Magog, to gather them togither to battel, the num∣ber of vvhome is as the sand of the Sea. And when the &c.The last per∣secution of Antichrist. When the world draweth toward euē∣tide, Satan shall be let looce, and Antichrists dominion shall lye heauy welnéere vpon the whole world. Satan shall be loo∣zed out of his prison. That is to saye, he shall be permitted too vse his power of deceiuing and doing mischéefe, wherein hee excelleth most. G. In this place Iohn describeth the last (yea and also the sorest and cruellest) persecution of Antichriste, which the said child of damnation shall stirre vp against the Church of Christ, through the egging of Satan. And he shall go out. M. He shall go out (saith he) namely by executing his po∣wer. q. d. He shall rage openly against Christs Churche: and then shall the thoughts of many mens hartes be laide open. Luke .2. e. 35. and they shall shew themselues to be open eni∣mies, which were supposed to be frends and of the same hous∣hold. To deceiue the people. That is to wit, he shall steyne them with false Religion and ioyne them to Antichristes kingdome, against the godly.Al religions shall conspyre against Christs Gospel. That are vpon the four quarters of the earth. Then is it not any one nation or Religion, but all the false Religions as many as be in the whole worlde, shall conspire against the truth of Christes Gospell, and as∣sault it on all sides. Which thing Iohn seemeth to haue be∣tokened when he saith, Vppon the foure corners of the earthe. A. Whereby we learne how great hatred of the truth is gref∣fed in men, sith the furthest nations of the whole worlde are gathered togither to assault it. [Euen] God and Magog. M.Priui bakbi∣ters and open persecuters. Gog that is to say such as haue couered eyes, and such as heaue at Christes doctrine priuily. And Magog, that is to say, suche as haue their eyes vncouered and do openly persecute them
that defend the truth of the Gospell. S. By these words there∣fore are meant all manner of wicked people be they priuie or be they open, be they houshold, or be they forrein enimies, which shal come into ye feeld togither against Christs Church. The Prophet termeth these, strong and great men, but yet shall Christ deale the spoyle of them. Esay. 53. b. 12. And in a∣nother place it is said that Antichrist is a smith that bloweth the Coles togither in the fyre. Esa. 54. c. 16. I. And in Ezechiell it is written of him in this wise, Thou shalt come vp as a multitude of waters, thou shalte come as a Cloude to couer the earth. Ezech. 38. c. 16. Also vnder resemblance of the king of the North: The king of the North (saith he) shall come vp∣pon the king of the South with chariots and horsemen and many shippes, and he shall come into his lands and ouerflow them and passe ouer them, and come into the pleasant land. &c. Dan. 11. b. 14.15. B. Also, all nations of the earth shall be ga∣thered togither againste Ierusalem. Zachar. 14. a. 2. These things therefore and such other like whiche the Iewes take out of the sayings of the Prophets, and interpret them too be meant of their owne nation, our Iohn being a singular good fetterforth of the Prophets minds at large, expoundeth to be meant of Christ and his Church, wherof ye said Ierusalē bea∣reth a representation in the scriptures: according to the Apo∣stles saying, Gal. 4. d. 26. Wherevpon Iohn agréeing wyth ye forealledged prophet, saith yt the number of thē is as the sand of the sea, & that they come vp through the whole earth, & be∣séeged the Camp of the saincts & the beloued Citie. V. And tru∣ly if we be not vtterly blind & besides our wits, we may con∣iecture somewhat by the Turks victories, wherethrough he hath triumphed in our time, by conquering the kingdoms of Egipt, Iewry & Ierusalē, by rooting out of ye great Souldan: and anone after for winning the Ile of Rhodes: and finally for conquering the kingdome of Hungarie,They that persecute the Gospell, per∣cute Chryst. and sleaing the king thereof. What is to be feared by it on our part, who séeth not? To gather them togither to battell. By this place we
learne, that all they whiche make warre againste Christs Gospell and disciples, are led by the spirit of Satan, & moued by his impulsion, vnder what pretence soeuer they affirme themselues to fight. Which thing would God that those men would marke wel, which at this day vnder pretēce of the tra∣ditions of their forefathers, (or rather vnder pretēce of their mother holy Churche,) dare assault ye witnessers of ye Gospel, & also put them cruelly to death, We know how Christ saith to his disciples: The houre wil come that whosoeuer killeth you shall thinke he doth high seruis vnto God Iohn. 16. a. 2.The fewnesse of the godlye, and the innu∣merble mul∣titude of the vngodly. The number of vvhom is as the sand of the Sea. S. By this speech héere seemeth to be betokened the fewnesse of the godlye, and the innumerable multitude of the vngodly, according also as we see. Whereby we learne, that Satans power is so great, as it cannot in any wise be ouercome by mans strength, but we haue néede of help from heauen. We be deceiued then if we thinke we haue to deale with men in this incounter of faith, or if we promis ourselues victory by our owne force. Nay rather, we ought to knowe, that (according as Paule teacheth, Ephe. 6. b. 12.) We must wrestle against spirituall wickednesse, that is to saye, with most wicked spirites, a∣gainste whome we must fight with faythe, prayer, fa∣sting, almesdeedes, teares, and all manner of denyall of our selues, and not with force of armes, nor with curious dis∣putations. 9. And they vvent vp vpon the bredth of the earth, and compassed the Camps of the saincts, and the belo∣ued Citie: And fyre came dovvne from God out of heauen, and deuoured them. And they went vp. &c. M.The churche of Chryste is besieged euery where tho∣roughe the whole world. By going vp he betokeneth the pride of Christes enimies. q. d. They wente vp with greate haultinesse of mind to fight against the godly. And compassed the Camps of the Saincts. P. He doth vs to wit, that they came not to some one place, as though ye Camps of the saincts & the
beloued Citie should be put in one place: (whereas the sayde Citie is nothing else but the Churche of Christe dispersed through the whole earth.) But hereby is meant that whither soeuer Antichrist goeth (for asmuch as Christes Church shall be in all nations of the earth, whiche thing is signifyed by tearming it the bredth of the earth,) there shall be the Campes of the Saincts, there shall be the Citie beloued of God, and there shal ye same Citie be beséeged by al hir enimies through the outrageousnesse of his persecution: that is to say she shall be distressed, pinched, and shut vp within the streightes of tribulatiō, and yet she shall not giue ouer hir warfare, which is tearmed by the name of Camps, M. bycause the sainctes are always ready to withstand their enimies manfully, and to fight lustely for defence of the truth euen to the last gasp of their life though neuer so great a number of enimies incoun∣ter them. For they know that God hath promised them vic∣tory. Also in the worde Compasse ye must consider the wyli∣nesse of Satan and the enimies of the Churche. For they as∣sayle not the godlye with open force: but priuily, and as it were by a windlasse, seeking to anoy them many wayes: which thing Sainct Peter hath warned vs of in these words: Be ye sober and watch yée: for your aduersary the Diuel go∣eth about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may deuour. 1. Pet 5. c. 8.The Church cannot be for∣saken. And the beloued Citie. By this title he sheweth that the Church cannot be forsaken of God. For it is his be∣loued Citie, the Prince whereof is the strong and mightye Lord, euen the Lord mighty in battell. Psal. 24. c. 8. Where∣vpō is by and by added the victory of the godly.The victorie of the Godly and ye destruc∣tion of the vngodlye. And fyre came downe from God. S. Hitherto he hath brought the Churche ty∣dings of aduersitie and heauinesse, and now he bringeth hir news of gladnesse. And he vseth the time past for the tyme to come, bycause all things are fore determined by most cer∣taine and assured decrée, and therefore are in effect as good as done already. And he séemeth to allude to the fire that consu∣med the Cities of Sodome and Gomor, the Tents of them
that made insurrectiō against Moses in the wildernesse, and the bands of fiftie men a péece which were sent by the king of Israell to take Elias. For it is as easye for God to make his heauenly fire to consume an innumerable multitude of men set farre asunder by distance of places, as to consume a feaw pent vp in one place togither. Neuerthelesse, fyre is ta∣ken in the scriptures for other punishments also, wherewith God is wont to destroy the wicked. Neyther do these thinges séeme to be referred to the last iudgement, but to the destruc∣tion of Antichrists army through the whole world.The strength and ayd of the godly cōmeth from heauen. Out of heauen. A. The godly then (as I told you euē now) haue néede of defence from heauen, if they will get the vpper hande of their enimies, and obteyne the victory whiche shall endure. For otherwise they be ouermatched both in strength and number, according as I saide a little afore. And deuoured them. Effectuall are the plagues whiche are sent of God too ouerthrow the enimies of Christ. For he is the almighty re∣uenger, whome all creatures ought to obey. 10. And the Diuell vvhich deceiued them, vvas cast into the pond of fyre and brimstone: vvhere the beast also and the false prophet shall be tormented day and night for euermore. And the Diuell which deceiued them.The punish∣ment of the Diuel and of al ye reprobats. After Iohn hath done with the destructiō of Antichrist, now in few words he com∣prehendeth that whiche the enimie Citie and hir prince the Diuell shall suffer at the last iudgement. VVas cast into the pond of fyre and brimstone. Iohn speaketh thus, to the intent to expresse, both the gréeuousnesse and the euerlastingnesse of the fyre: according to our sauiours saying, Go ye cursed in∣to euerlasting fyre, which is prepared for the Diuell and his Angells. Math. 25. d. 41. VVhere the beast also and the false pro∣phet shall be tormented. Of these we haue heard alredy, These two were cast aliue into the pond that burneth with fire and brimstone: Héeretofore. 19. d. 20. Therefore by the beast hée
méeneth very Antichrist with his chosen péeres: and by the false Prophets, the preachers & mainteiners of Antichrists kingdome. And these he specifyeth by name, bycause of the exceeding spitefulnesse of their malice, which also shall be pu∣nished with sorer peines. Day and night. A. That is to say con∣tinually without any respit. For euermore. Agayne we see that the punishmente of the Diuell and of the damned shall bee endlesse. 11. And I savv the great vvhite Throne and him that sitteth vppon it, from vvhose sight fled both the earthe and the heauen, and their place vvas no more found. The generall iudgement.And I saw the great whyte Trone. A. It is not without cause that Peter auoucheth the end of all thinges to draw néere at hand. 1. Pet. 4. b. 7. For the fashion of this world must néedes passe away. 1. Cor. 7. f. 31. and the last iudgement must be exe∣cuted vpon men, to the ende that euery man may receiue the things that are done by the body, according to that which hée hath done be it good or euil. 2. Cor. 5. b. 10. G Now then like as Daniel saw stooles set, & the auncient of days set downe, and iudgement executed, and the bookes opened. Dan. 7. c. 9. So also in this place, Iohn seeth Christe the iudge of the whole world come in maiestie to iudge ye world openly, vncorrupt∣ly, and without any feyning. S. And it is the rehersall of a for∣mer declaration. For he declareth in order after what man∣ner the iudgemente was disclosed vnto him. I saw (saith he) the great Throne. Great indéede, for the greate iudge of the world sitteth vpon it. Of whome Paule speaketh in thys wise, waiting for that blissed hope and the open manifestati∣on of the glory of ye great God & of our sauiour Iesus Christ. Tit. 2. d. 13.The glorious∣nesse, vpright∣nesse & open∣nesse of the last iudgemēt And the Angell Gabriel said to the virgin Mary. He shall be great, & shal be called ye son of the highest. Luke. 1. c. 32. VVhite. G. That is to wit, made bright with the cléere∣nesse of the heauēly light. For the sonne of man shall come in his glory, and shall sit vpō the seate of his glory. Mat. 25. d. 31.
A. Furthermore there shal be no corruption in that iudgemēt, but al things shal be done with singular purenesse & vpright∣nesse, without any respect of persons. Lastly, nothing can bee hidden from that iudge: nay rather the things that are nowe hidden and darksome, shall then come to light, and be made open to the whole world. And therfore Paule saith, iudge not at al befre the time, vntil the Lord come, who will discouer the priuities of darknesse, and lay open the intents of mens harts, and then shall euery man receiue praise at Gods hād. 1. Cor. 4. a. 5. And him that sitteth vpō it. That is to wit, Christ the very sonne of God and man, whome God hath ordeyned to be iudge of ye quicke and the dead. Act. 10. g. 42.The terrible∣nesse of the last iudgemēt. From whose syght fled both the earth and the heauen. G. The last iudgement shall be so terrible, that heauen and earth, (that is to say all manner of men) shall be moued and put in feare, which thing must notwithstanding be vnderstoode of the reprobates only. For that day shall be a swéete and ioyfull day to all the cho∣sen, bycause their full and perfect redemption shall then bée néere at hand. Luke. 21. f. 28. And therefore they are sayde too long for the comming of this iudge & also to loue it. 2. Tim. 4 b. 8. Neuerthelesse, the thing that Iohn speaketh heere, may be vnderstood of the renuing of heauen and earth:Christe shall make al thin∣ges new. For he ad∣deth, And their place was no more found. M. For like as darknes is chaced away at the comming of the Sunne: euen so shall al infection of the elements, and al anoyance of corruption be chaced away at Christes appéering in glory, and all shall bée made new. Of whiche renuing looke Esay. 65. c. 17. &. 66. and also in the first and. 23. verses of the. 20. chapter. Notwithstā∣ding, this one thing is to be noted concerning the Elements of the world: that they shall be consumed only as in respect of their qualitie to be renued in qualitie but they shal remayne stil in substance the same that they be, according as it is easie to be gathered by Rom. 8. d. 20. & Psal. 102.26.27.28. & Hebr. 1. c. 11. &. 2. Pet. 3. d. 12.13. and by diuers other places.
12. And I savv the dead both great and small stan∣ding in the presence of God: And bookes vvere ope∣ned: And another booke vvas opened vvhiche is the booke of life: and the dead vvere iudged by the thyngs that vvere vvritten in the bookes, according too theyr vvorkes. The generall Resurrection.And I saw the dead. A. He speaketh of the generall resurrec∣tion of the bodies: for which looke, 1. Cor. 15. All nations (saith Christe) shall be gathered togither before him. Math. 25. c. 32. Great and small. E. By the great ones he betokeneth the migh∣ty men of this world, as Tyrants, Kings, Princes, and no∣ble men: and by the small he betokeneth such as were coun∣ted bace of birth and of no reputation in this world, and ther∣withall also such as departed out of this life when they were but newly borne. Wherby he purposeth to do vs to vnder∣stand, that God hath a regard of all folks, whither they were counted great, or whither they were counted nothing worth among men. In respect whereof also Paule sayth: we must all of vs shew ourselues at Christes iudgemente seate, that euery man may receiue the things that are wrought by the body, according to that which he hath done be it good or bad, 2. Cor. 5. b. 10. And againe, Euery man shall yéeld an account for himselfe vnto God. Rom. 14. c. 12. Also, knowing that your Lord or master also is in heauen, and that there is no re∣spect of persons with him.The booke of mennes consciences Ephe. 6. b. 9. And bookes were ope∣ned. S. These bookes seeme to be the consciences of all men bée they good or bad, which shall as then be layd open, according as the Apostle witnesseth Roma. 2. c. 15. &. 1. Cor. 4. a. 5. by rea∣son that Christ shall bring all the things to light which were couered before. P. Othersome take these bookes to be the olde and new Testaments, that for asmuch as there is shewed in them what God had commaunded, it shoulde appéere also by them what euery man had done or not done. But the first exposition is the truer. And there was another booke opened,
which is the booke of life. S.The booke of lyfe, or Gods eternall pre∣destination. This is the booke wherein the cho∣sen are reported to be written before the beginning of the worlde, by reason of the certentie of their predestination. Whereof thou readest thus, Eyther forgiue them this of∣fence, or if thou wilt not do it, wipe me out of the booke of life which thou hast written. Exod. 32. g. 32. Also, be glad, for your names be written in heauen. Luke. 10. d. 20. Also, whose names are in the booke of life. Phi. 4. a. 3. Moreouer it is a si∣militude borowed of the custome of men, who in taking mu∣sters are wonte to write the choycer sort, and to call them by name. So is God saide to take a vew of his seruantes by name, and to call them by name. Exod. 33. c. 12. & Iohn. 10. a. 3. A.How men may knowe whither they be chosen of God or no. Therefore if we will know certeinly whither our names be written in the booke of life, (that is to say, whither we bee chosen and predestinated to euerlasting life) we néede not to be curious in searching Gods secret purpose, but let vs haue an eye onely vnto Chryste. For in him hath the father chosen all those whome he hathe determined from the bein∣ning to saue. Now if wée bée chosen in Christ, we shall not fynde the certeintie of our election in our selues, no nor in God the father, nother if wée thynke vppon him barely without the sonne. Chryst then is the lookingglasse where∣in it behoueth vs, yea and wherein we may (without mista∣king) beholde our election. For sith that hée is the partie intoo whose bodye the father hath determined to ingreffe those whome he hath purposed from euerlasting to make his owne, so as be accounteth them all as hys owne chil∣dren, whom hee registreth among the members of him: we haue sufficient, manifest, and assured warrant that wee be written in the booke of lyfe, if we communicate wyth Chryste. And he hathe assuredly communicated hymselfe vntoo vs, in asmuch as hée hath witnessed by the preaching of hys Gospell, that hée is giuen vnto vs by the father to be ours, with all the good thinges whiche he hath He himselfe (I saye) hath witnessed vntoo vs, that hys heauenly father will take them al for his sonnes, which receiue him by faith.
A. Wherevnto perteine such promises as these, He that bée∣léeueth in me hath life euerlasting. Iohn. 3. d. 36. & 6. e. 40. All yt come and beléeue in me shall not die for euer. Iohn. 11. c. 26. Also, Al of you are the childrē of God through the faith which is in Christ Iesu. Gal. 3. d. 26. If we couet any more thā to be accounted amōg ye childrē & heirs of God, thē may we mount aboue Christ: but if that be ye utmost marke we shoote at, how mad are we to séeke the thing out of him; which we haue al∣ready atteined in him, & is not to be founde any where but in him only? Furthermore seing he is ye euer lasting wisdome of ye father, his vnchangeable truth, & his settled determinatiō: we neede not to feare least ye thing that he declareth to vs by his worde, should vary any thing at all frō that will of ye fa∣ther which we séeke to be assured of. Nay rather, we ought to beléeue that he openeth the same vnto vs faithfully, euen in such sort as it hath bin frō ye beginning, & as it shall be euer∣more. A. But of these thinges I haue written more in the. 8. verse of the. 17. Chapter and in the. 8. verse of the. 13. Chapter héeretofore.The vpright∣nesse of Gods iudgmēt with out respect of persone. And the dead were iudged. G. God the righteous iudge of al mē needeth no opening of bookes: for he knoweth al things euē before they come to passe: but suche manner of spéech is borowed of Courtmatters and mens iudgemēts in law. For whē iudges discusse mens caces, they are wont too haue their pleas set downe in writing, & to giue sentence ac∣cording to yt things that are writtē & allowed. S. Iohn therfore cōmendeth vnto vs ye excéeding great vprightnesse of ye iudge Christ, who hath no respect of person, but iudgeth acording to ye things yt are cōteined in the boke, that is to say, acording to ye things yt euery mā knoweth in himself by ye witnesse of his own cōscience. Rom. 2. c. 15. Furthermore, some take ye dead, for the wicked sort only, bicause the godly shal iudge & not be iudged. Math. 19. d. 28. &. 1. Cor. 6. a. 2. But more rightly de o∣thers vnderstand this to be spokē as wel of the godly as of ye vngodly. For God the father hath appointed Christ to be the iudge of all men. Acts. 10. g. 42. and be shall call the good to the
kingdome of heauen, and send away the euil into euerlasting fire. Mat. 25. c. 34.41.46. Besides this, Paule in ye place afore∣recited saith: to the intent that euery man may receiue accor∣ding to that which he hath done with his body, be it good or euil. 2. Cor. 5. b. 10. And the dead are said to be iudged, to ye end we may know how ther remain both punishmēts & rewards after the resurrectiō & iudgement, for suche as haue departed hēce & haue not receiued in this life according to their déedes. A. Howbeit as touching ye chosen, it is always a general rule,A general rule concerning the rewarding of ye chosen. that they be rewarded with glory, not for their owne desert, but through Gods frée mercy, by reason wherof their sinnes are not laid to their charge, for Christs sake. In respect wher∣of Paul saith: I am of opiniō that the troubles of this present time, are not to be compared with the glory that shall be she∣wed vpō vs. Rom. 8. d. 18. According to their works. For thys most vpright iudge shal render vnto euery man according to his déedes. Rom. 2. a. 6. and Heretofore. 2. f. 23. & Math. 16. d. 27. 13. And the Sea gaue vp his dead which were in him: and death and hel gaue vp the dead that vvere in them: and euery of them was iudged according to his works. And the sea gaue. &c.The restitu∣tion of ye same bodies again. These things are spoken by a turning backe again, for Iohn layth foorth ye which he had set downe afore, [whē he said] I saw ye dead both great & smal, stāding, &c. There be some which by these dead folks do vnderstande those that shal be aliue at the time of the iudgement, bycause this presēt world is now & thē in ye scriptures termed a sea. Of which ouerliuers ye Apostle treateth. 1. Thess. 4. d. 15. But this sense is more streined, thā that it can agree to ye present place. B. Therfore we take it simply to be ment of those yt haue perished in the Sea or fresh waters, or whose bodies being burned into ashes haue bin cast into the sea or into riuers in the time of persecution, so as it might séeme incredible yt euer they shuld be restored whole & sound again, & yet notwithstā∣ding they shal be repaired againe by ye power of Christ. Iohn thē sheweth opēly, yt the bodies of ye dead shal be quickned a∣gain
at ye iudgement, how far soeuer they haue bin scattered asunder, yea euē though they haue bin eatē vp by ye fishes of ye sea:What is ment heere by death and Hell. which thing some heretikes haue denied. And death and Hel. By death we vnderstād such as haue dyed by any maner of way: whither it be by fire, or by halter, or by sword: why∣ther they be buried or vnburied, or whither they be cast away to be deuoured of beasts & of ye foules of the aire: And by Hell we vnderstād such as are buried & brought into ye dust of the earth: wherby he betokeneth, ye nothing is vnpossible to ye po¦wer of Christ. A. Al these things hath Christ comprehēded in one sentēce in the Gospel, saying: The hour wil come that al they which are in their graues shal héere his voice, and come forth, they yt haue done wel, vnto the resurrection of life, and those that haue done euil, vnto the resurrectiō of iudgement. Iohn. 5. e. 28. For so is meant by that which Iohn addeth, say∣ing: And euery of them was iudged according to his workes. Looke vpon the first verse of this Chapter. 14. And Hel and death were cast into the pond of fire. This is the second death. 15. And he that was not found written in the booke of lyfe, was cast into the pond of fire. The vtter do∣ing away of Death.And Hel & death. S. This séemeth to be spokē vnder ye same figure yt in another place it was said, death is swalowed vp in victory. And also, ye last enemy that shall be done away, is death .1. Cor. 15. c. 26. Neuerthelesse it may also be takē of thē which rose not again frō ye death of sin in ye first resurrectiō, & therfore shal not haue part in ye second resurrectiō, but shall be cast into the pond of fire.Death of sinne & death of ye soule. This is the second death. q. d. Beware of the first death, that is to wit, of the death of sin: for vpon that first death by sin of final vnrepētātnesse, shal folow this seconde.The endlesse damnation of all the repro∣bates. And he that was not found. &c. This is spoken gene∣rally of al ye reprobates, who are shut out frō eternal life for euer, bycause they haue no feloship in ye body of Christ. B. For the only faithfull in Christ, (in whom they be predestinated to euerlasting life) shal be saued. All ye rest shal perish, of what Religion soeuer they be, or what trade of liuing soeuer they liue, be it neuer so streight.
The one and twentie Chapter. AND I savv a nevv heauen and a nevv earthe: for the first heauen and the first earth vvent avvay: and there vvas no more Sea. ANd I saw a new heauen. &c. A.The cōtents of this Chapter. In this Chapter we be taught, that after the destruction and damnation of the vngodly, all the godly shall reigne euerlastingly with Christ their head, and happily enioy the good things which are prepared only for those whome God hath chosen from the be∣ginning in Christ. Moreouer this is the seuenth and last vi∣sion of this booke, wherby we are informed of the happy state of the Church, (that is to say of Christes kingdome) and so consequently of the renuing of the world. For it treateth of the Sabbot and holy rest, namely when both bodie and soule shall be perfectly glorifyed togither. S. Neuerthelesse, some expound this Chapter to be meant of the Apostolike Church at the beginning of it. Others take it to be meant of the meane time betwixt the destruction of Antichrists kingdome and the iudgement. And othersome againe do wrest it to the happinesse of the life to come. But it seemeth to be vnderstood of the whole state of Christes kingdome, namely in the be∣ginning, in the middle time, and in the time of the last felici∣tie: and that in such wise, as some things are answerable to the beginning of that kingdome, some to the middle tyme of it, and some to the end of it, and othersome agree both to the beginning, to the middle time, and to the end of it, accordyng as shall be shewed in their places.The renuing of al things by Christ and the ful restitution of his tree and glorious king¦dome. A newe heauen and a newe earth. S. Christ shall make all things new. The Prophet Esay purposing to foreshew the prosperitie whiche Gods people shuld enioy in Ierusalem and in the whole land of Chanaan after the end of their captiuitie: among other things wherby he peinteth out that prosperitie before their eyes, promiseth
a renewment both of heauen and earth. Beholde (saith he) I will make a new heauen and a new earthe, the former shall be remembered no more, neyther shall they come any more in minde. But reioyce ye and be glad for euer in the thinges that I make anew. For beholde, I make Ierusalem new a∣gaine, and I will reioyce in my people, and the voyce of wee∣ping and mourning shal no more be heard in hir. Esay. 65. c. 17. Therefore in asmuch as the Prophet Iohn hath prophe∣syed of the restitution of Religion, yea and of prosperitie a∣mong the people of God: he doth aright to speake of the hap∣pinesse of Christs kingdome immediatly after: vnder the fi∣gure whereof he speaketh also of the renuing of the worlde, wherof some maner of tast is felt in the meane while: accor∣ding to each mans portiō of godlinesse, & the full accomplish∣mēt therof is looked for at length in the new creation, accor∣ding to the Apostles saying, Rom. 8. d. 20.21. And it is meta∣phorically said that heauē & earth are renued: bicause yt vnto such as be plunged in sorow, heauen, earth, & (to be bréefe) all things seme vnpleasant, & as though they would fall vppon thē: but whē things are changed to ye better, so as heauinesse cesseth & mēs minds be cheered vp: heauen and earth and all thinges seeme to haue a new countenance. Now then if the heauen séemed to haue a new countenance at suche time as Gods people were deliuered from captiuitie, and religion in part set vp againe: How much more fully shall that come too passe, when God shall haue begonne to reigne throughly by Christ: when the aduersary powers are vtterly dispatched, & perfect peace restored to ye Church when the creature of God is set frée from the bondage of corruption, and deliuered into the glorious libertie of the childrē of God? G. And yet no doubt but there shal be a renuing both of heauen and earth, euen in visible shape also: according as Peter witnesseth. Waiting (saith he) and hasting for ye cōming of the day of God, in which ye heauens shall perish with fire, and the elements shall bée melted with heate. But we looke for a new heauē and a new
earth, according to his promis. 2. Pet. 3. c. 13.The renuing ye heauens. For the first heauē and the first earth went away. M. That is to wit from al maner of corruption which they had gotten héeretofore. Looke Rom 8. d. 21. & Hebr. 1. c. 11. &. 2. Pet. 3. c. 12. and also the. 11. verse of the 20. Chapter afore. And there was no more Sea. S. The sea,The renuing of the sea. by the commaundement of our good maker, serueth for sundrye turnes and behoofs of men. Therefore it shall be renued as well as all other elements, and be set free from bondage by the restitution of man. Rom. 8. d. 21. Neuerthelesse some thinke that by these wordes it is meant, that the troublous life of this world (which is betokened oftentimes in the scrip∣tures by the name of Sea) shall ceasse at that time. But the former exposition is the playner and the lesse cou∣strayned. 2. And I Iohn savv that holy Citie nevv Ierusalem come dovvne from heauen prepared of God as a bride garnished for hir husband. And I Iohn. G. Iohn hath expressed his name in this place, to the intent the more credit might be giuen to this vision.A description of the Trium∣phāt Church. Saw that holy Citie. It is called the holy Citie, bycause it is indu∣ed with the spirite which maketh holy. B. For as many as bée chosen by Gods euerlasting prouidence, to be compacted into the body of the Churche, are made holy all of them by the Lord, through spirituall newbirth. For the order of Goddes mercie is described by Paule to be this: that whome hée hath chosen, them he calleth: whome hée hathe called, them hée iustifyeth: and whome he hath iustifyed, them he glorifyeth. Romaynes. 8. f. 30. New. Like as héere is mention made of a newe heauen and a new earthe: so also is héere men∣tion made of a newe Citie, namely of suche a one as bée∣ing indued wyth heauenly giftes, shall also mynd a hea∣uenly life. Ierusalem. The Church is likened to this Citie, by reason of the mutual agréement of the Citizens amōg them∣selues, & of their couenant made with God by the Mediator
Christ, where vpon springeth peace and tranquilitie: accor∣ding as it is written, In his days shall spring vp righteous∣nesse and abundance of peace. &c. Psal. 72. b. 7. Come downe ftom heauen. P. This Citie is said to come downe from hea∣uen, bycause God hath indued it with a heauenly grace, in respect whereof also he saythe by his Prophet, I am the God that made thée. &c. Esay. 43. b. 7. Truely euen from hir firste beginning she came from heauen, and thencefoorth through all the time of this world, hir Citizens increase from tyme to time through the grace of God, which commeth downe vp∣pon hir by the Lauer of newbirth in the holy Ghost sente downe from heauen. But through Gods last iudgemente which shal be executed by his sonne Iesus Christ, hir bright∣nesse shall become so great & so good, through the gift of God, that there shall remaine no specke of hir former agednesse, for asmuch as our bodies shall passe out of their old corrupti∣on & mortalitie, fresh and new to vncorruption and immor∣talitie. Moreouer this Citie commeth downe from heauen, bycause hir king also came from heauen, and she hirselfe be∣ing indued with heauenly power, is conuersant all the while in heauenly things by mind. For which matter looke Gal. 4. d. 26. & Phil. 3. d. 20.21. & Coloss. 3. a. 1. & Hebr. 11. c. 10. Prepared of God. P. That is to wit, preuented with Gods grace. As a bryde garnished for hir husband.Christ the only husband of ye Churche, decketh hir with Iewels. That is to saye for Christe the true husband of the Church. For as the bridegroome sendeth pre∣sēts to ye bryde before he marrie hir & take hir to him for a ful ado: Euē so Christ giueth faith, vertue, & al other good works to his Church, before he cupple hir perfectly to himselfe & re∣ward hir with ful blissednesse. S. Iohn therfore speaketh of the gifts of ye holy ghost, which are ye ornamēts of ye church which is the spouse of Christ. Cōcerning which gifts looke Ro. 12. b. 6.7.8. and. 1. Cor. 12. a. 8.9.10.11. &. Eph. 4. b. 8. also looke in the fifth verse of the fourth Chapter heretofore. A. Neuerthelesse hir preparing & garnishing vnto hir husbād Christ is such in this present life, as notwithstanding, she is not yet indued
with al hir ornamēts. But when Christ cōmeth vnto Iudge∣mēt, looke what shée wāteth now, shal be supplied then, yt she may be throughly cuppled to hir husbād in glorious immor∣talitie & perfect blissednesse. Then shall she be deliuered vnto Christ, dispatched of all agednesse, glorious, & without spot, yt is to say, holy & vnblamable. G. And this holy Citie shall haue al hir Citizēs in hir, & shée shal want nothing that may make hir perfect. M. To be breef, like as Ierusalem, by reason of the Temple and the holie things perteyning to the Temple, and like as a bryde prepared for hir brydegrome, be the godlyest of all things: Euen so the Catholike Church which is too bee cuppled vnto God after the Resurrection, shall in beautie and gorgeousnesse, far surmount al the beautie and gorgeousnesse of the whole world. 3. And I herde a great voyce out of Heauen, saying: beholde, the Tabernacle of God is vvith men, and he vvill dvvell vvith them and they shall bee his people, & God himself vvill be vvith them and be their God. And I herde a great voyce. This voyce is sayde too haue bin great, bycause talke was had of great matters,The faithful are Gods Temple, tent, dwling place. namely of the cuppling of God and men, who heretofore were furthest dis∣seuered one from another by reason of sinne. Esai. 59. a. 2. Be¦hold the Tabernacle of God is among men. S. The same thing is written welnéere in the self same wordes by the Prophete, who sayth. And I wil settle them and multiply them, and set holinesse among them for euermore. And my Tabernacle shal be among them, and I will bée their God, and they shall bée my people, and the heathen shall know how I the Lorde am he that maketh Israel holie. &c. Ezech. 37. g. 27. Whereby it appéereth therwithall, to what purpose the Ceremonie of the old Tabernacle tended. Which thing Paul also sheweth when he calleth the faithfull, Gods temple, by reason of hys spirit which dwelleth in thē. 1. Cor. 3. c. 16. &. 6. d. 19. &. 2. Cor. 6. d. 16. A. And it wil appéere thorowly, that God dwelleth amōg
those that bée his, when Christe receyueth all the chosen intoo euerlasting glorie, too inioy the continuall happinesse of the heauenly kingdome, which is prepared for them from the be∣ginning of the worlde. Math. 25. c. 34. M. For then shall euery one of the blissed sorte bée Gods Tabernacle there by glorie, which were his tabernacle here by grace. And they shallbe hys people. That is to say, In no cace offending him: which thing cannot come to passe while they be in the fleshe. And God him∣self will be with them and be their God. q. d. They shal neuer be put from him thenceforth by sinne. 4. And God vvill vvype avvay all teares from their eyes: and there shall bee no more death: neither shall there bee any more mourning, or crying, or sorow: for the firste things are gone. The ioy of the faithfull in in the euerla∣sting kingdōe of Christ.And God wil wype away al. &c. S. So also spake the Prophet concerning the happinesse that was to come vpon the people of God after their returne frō the thraldome of Babilon, say∣ing: I wil daunce in Ierusalem and be merie among my peo∣ple, and the voyce of wéeping and crying shall not be herde in hir any more. &c. Esai. 65. c. 19. By which wordes, the Prophet foresheweth the ioy of the faythful in the kingdome of Christ, which the godly haue in the meane season in the holie Ghost, (as Paule saythe Rom. 14. c. 17. and Gala. 5. d. 22.) tyll it may bee fully perfected in time too come. M. But great and vnspea∣kable is Gods gracious goodnesse & louing kyndnesse towards his faithfull, where through he not onely maketh them Citi∣zens of his moste excellent Kingdome, but also fulfilleth the duetie of a mother and a Nurce towardes them. For tender harted Mothers and Nurces are woont too wype awaye the teares from the childrens eyes which they cherishe, bycause they cannot abide to beholde the signes of sorow in them whō they haue a great desire too please: for it makes the water too stand in the mothers eyes too sée it. But by this spéeche Iohn
meaneth, that God will not suffer any print of former olde sorowes too remayne in the Saincts, bycause they shall enioy euerlasting comfort and glorie without end.The long lyfe of the faithful. And there shall be no more death: neither shall there be any mourning. &c. S. These things also agrée with the wordes of the Prophet. There shal be no more any babe of dayes (saith he) nor any olde man that filleth not his dayes: for a man of a hundred yéeres olde shall die a childe, and a sinner of a hundred yeeres olde shall be cur∣sed. &c. Esai. 65. d. 20. The Prophet speaketh of the length of lyfe, which also is not counted a smal part of happinesse. Here∣of the Prophet promiseth suche length too the people of God, that he which departeth out of lyfe a hundred yéere olde, shall bée counted too dye a childe. And age which is wont too bee ac∣companied with feeblenesse of strength, shall bee there wyth∣out fayling of strength. So the godly in Christes kingdome doo of common ordinarie come too rype age: accordyng as it is too bee seene well neere in all the Apostles. Furthermore he that beléeueth in Christ shall not die for euer. Iohn. 5. d. 24 and 11. c. 26. For the firste things are gone. A. Namely the sorowes, sighes, droopings, troubles, and finally death it selfe: all which things haue spring of sinne. 5. And he that sate on the Throne, sayde: Beholde I make all things newe. And he sayd vnto me vvryte, for these vvordes are faithfull and true. And he that sate on the Throne. M. He speaketh of God,God. who sitteth in a throne as the soueraine and most vpright iudge of all. Beholde I make all things newe. S.The renuing of all thing at the last udg∣ment day. Manie thinke this too bee spoken of the ordeyning of the newe lawe after the Ceremo∣nies of Moses Lawe were abolished, accordyng too this say∣ing of the Prophete, what is this house whyche yee wyll build vntoo mée. &c. And within a little after, Bee merye wyth Ierusalem and reioyce in hir all yee that loue hir. &c.
Also, And some of them that shall bée saued I will send intoo the Sea. &c. And they shall preache my glorie to the Gentils, and bring all your brethren to me &c. And I will take of thē to be my Leuites and Priests (saith the Lord.) For like as the new heauens and the new earth doo, which I make too stande before mée saith the Lord God: so shall your séede and your name stand. &c. Esai. 66. d. 22.23. All which things agrée well ynough to the spredding abrode of Christes Kingdome by the Apostles. But euen heere also both the Prophetes had a fur∣ther forelooke: namely to the newbirth of the time too come when all things shal bée fully restored and chaunged too the better by the renewing of man. G. Then shall bée the continu∣all Sabbat kéeping, and the true rest from all labours, when no aduersitie or sorowe can trouble vs. And he sayd vnto me, wryte. Namely for the profit of them that bée now, and the re∣memberance of them that bée too come. For these woordes are faithfull and true.The effectual¦nesse of Gods word. B. q. d. Most worthie are these things to be be∣léeued. S. Euen so the Prophet (or rather the Lord by the Pro∣phet) sayd as concerning his owne word: Like as a shower or snowe commeth downe from heauen and returneth not thither ageine, but watereth the earth and soketh intoo it, and maketh it to bud, and yeeldeth séede to the sower, and bread to him that eateth: so shall my worde be that passeth out of my mouth: it shal not returne too mee in vaine, but shal do what∣soeuer I haue willed, & shall prosper in ye things that I haue sent it vntoo. Esai. 55. c. 10.11. So also sayth Christ, Heauē and earth shall passe away, but my worde shall not passe away. Mat. 24. c. 35. And Iohn speaketh heere of the thinges that he spake euen now when he sayde, Beholde, the Tabernacle of God is among men, and God will wype away all teares from the eyes of them. &c. All which thyngs are a wonderfull comfort vnto troubled mindes, if they be receiued with liuely faith as they ought to bee.
6. And he sayd to mee, It is done: I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ende, vntoo him that is a thirst, I vvill giue of the vvell of the liuing vvater free∣ly. And he said vntoo mee, It is done. M. q. d.The effectual∣nesse of Gods determina∣tions. All things are accom∣plished that were foretold concerning the kingdom of Christ. The world, sin, death, the diuell, and Hell shal bée vtterly cast downe, and all Christes enemies shall be made his footestole: after which time there is none other prophesie too bée looked for. S. Also by these words is betokened a most safe and certein assurance. For Gods saying, is his very doyng. For he said the word, and they were done. Psal. 148. a. 5. Therefore whatsoe∣uer things he saith, must be taken as done, and no doubt must be cast of them. In respect whereof the Prophetes auouch the things that are to come, as thoughe they were alreadie doone. And therefore he sayth héere, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. He rendereth a cause wherefore the said words be faithfull and true, and to be accounted as alrea∣die done: namely for as muche as he that promiseth hathe all things in his hand, and al things haue their beginning of him, & al things end in him. M. q. d. I can easly bring to passe this re∣nuing of heauen and earth and of all other things. For I crea∣ted them all, and all shall bee finished in mee. For there was not any God before mee, neither shall there bée any God after mée. Esai. 43 b. 10.11. Looke vpon the like sentence heretofore in the eyght and eleuenth verses of the first Chapter.Christ ye wel∣spring of lyfe yt refresheth al the godly. Vntoo him that is a thirste, I will giue of the well of the liuing water. M. That is to wit of my self who am the euerlasting life. Whē the Prophet speaketh of the happinesse of Christs kingdome, he willeth all nations in any wise to hie them vnto Christ the welspring of lyfe, by following the doctrine of the Gospel. All ye that are a thirst (saith he) come to the waters. Esai. 55. a. 1. He saith, vnto him that is a thirst, bicause that if we mind too bee capable and partakers of Gods grace, it behoueth vs too
craue it with acknowledgement of our own slendernesse and want: like as Christ saithe, blissed are they that hunger and thirst after rightuousnesse, for they shall be satisfyed. Mat. 5. a. 6. Also, Come vnto mée all ye that labour and are heauie lodē, and I wyll refreshe you,Thirst. Mat. 11. d. 28. Also, if any man thirst, let him come vntoo mée and drinke, Iohn. 7. f. 37. Moreouer the Metaphor of thirst is taken for anie manner of great de∣sire or longing: like as when it is sayde, Euen as the harte brayeth after the fountaynes of water: euen so doth my soule cry vntoo thee O God, My soule hath thirsted after the lyuing God. &c. Psalm. 42. a. 2. G. Therefore like as a thirstie person, the longer he is kepte from drinke, the sorer is he athirst: so is it a signe that a man shall haue hys fill of the glorye too come, when his thirstie soule longeth so muche the more af∣ter it, as it is the more delayed. And like as drinke is whol∣some too hym that is a thirste: so shall euerlasting saluation come vntoo hym onely, whyche is desyrous of the blissed life, and laboureth too catche holde of it.The exclu∣ding of mens merites. I wyll gyue. A. When he saythe I wyll giue, he shetteth out all desertes of men. So saythe the Prophet, You that haue no money, come, buy, and eate. &c. Esai. 55. a. 1. And Chryst saythe of his owne shéepe, And I gyue them eternall lyfe. Iohn. 10. e. 28. Of the wel of the lyuing water. He that drinketh of the water that I wyll gyue hym (saythe Chryst) shall neuer thirst,The liuing water, ye mean to drink ther∣of, & the frute that cōmeth by drinking the same. but the water that I will gyue him shall bée a fountayne of water spring∣ing intoo euerlasting lyfe. Iohn. 4. c. 14. K. The meane too drinke of this water is by faith. Euery one then that drinketh of that water, (that is to say, whiche beléeueth in Christ and receiueth the holy Ghost) shall neuer thirst anie more: but it shall become a fountaine of liuing water in him. And this is all one with that which is sayde in another place. He that be∣leeueth in mée, streames of lyuely water shall flowe out of his belly: and this he ment of the spirit which they should receiue that beléeue in him, Iohn. 7. f. 39. For he that receiueth the holy Ghost by faith, hath a vain that gusheth out of sinfulnesse
into rightuousnes, out of damnatiō into saluatiō, out of death into life, & out of the earth into heauē. B. Certein it is therefore yt this water is ye holy Ghost. Now thē if he that hath drunke of this spirit cā neuer thirst: It is euident, yt he to whō this spi∣rit once befalleth, (yt is too say to whō it is giuen once to haue faith) cā neuer fal out of Gods fauor. Herevpō Paul glorieth yt nothing aboue or beneath cā remoue him frō ye loue of God, Rom. 8. g. 35. C. Neither is it against the meaning of Christes words, that ye faithful burne with earnest desire of more abū∣dant grace euē too the ende of their life. For he meaneth not yt we drinke our fill by & by at the first day, but his meaning is, yt the holy Ghost is a cōtinuall running streme, and so, yt they which are renewed with spiritual grace, are not in daūger of drying vp. Although thē that we thirst al our life long: yet are we sure yt we haue drunk ye holy ghost, not for a day or twain or for a little while: but too the end he should slow in vs conti∣nually without fayling. After this sort ye faithful doo thirst all their lyfe long: yea & that verie egerly: & yet they haue abun∣dance of lyuely moysture al the while, bycause yt howe little grace so euer they haue receiued, it kéepeth thē fresh continu∣ally, so as they neuer cā bée vtterly dry altogither. And there∣fore this filling is matched, not ageinst longing,Of Filling. but ageinst drying away. Which thing is expressed yet more plainely in these words, it shal become a fountain of water springing in∣to euerlasting life. For therby is betokened continual moyste∣ning, which cherisheth ye euerlasting heauēlynesse in them in this mortal & transitorie life. B. For like as ye man could neuer parch away for thirst, which had a foūtain cōtinually spring∣ing & féeding him in his bowels: ehē so must he needs haue his fil of al good things & comfort at hād in al caces, which hath in him the spirit of ye lord which is ye spirit of his childrē. Not for a short while thē doth Christs grace flow in vs: but it extēdeth it selfe euen vnto blissed immortalitie, bicause it ceaseth not too flowe, vntill the vncorruptible lyfe which it beginneth, be fully perfected in all poynctes. Freely. Ageyne be excludeth mennes merites, leaste anye man myghte falsely flatter
himselfe.An vtter ex∣cluding of mens merits. q. d. The Philosophers and wise men of the worlde sell theyr doctrines déere, whych are but as troubled waters, and are not able to quench mens thirst: but I will giue a mā liuing water of frée cost, if so bée that he bee a thirste. And what can the Meritmongers babble héere, when they héere that Chryste will giue thirstie folke the fountaine of lyg water fréely? A. So also in another place he saythe: He that beléeueth in mée (as the Scripture hath sayd) streames of ly∣uing water shall flowe oute of his belly. Iohn. 7. f. 38. And it is alwayes most true which Austin beateth oftentymes vpon saying: God crowneth in vs, not oure deseruings, but his owne giftes. P. Christ dooth as nowe but besprinckle the be∣léeuers in their waye, with this fountayne of liuing wa∣ter: but he will giue it abundantly to them that ouercome, too drinke their fill of it in the heauenly countrie: and ieast they might fainte for thirst while they bée wayfaring in this wil∣dernesse: they are now but bedeawed with it: but when they be come home into their countrey they shall drinke their fill continually of the riuer of Gods pleasures. 7. He that ouercommeth shal inherit all things: and I vvill be his God, and he shall be my sonne. Christen manlinesse.He that ouercommeth. A. It is an incoragement to stedfast∣nesse & holding out. For the life of a Christenman is a conti∣nuall warfare. For as soone as we haue put our selues into Christes seruice, we haue conspired ageinst the Prince of the world, and so we haue let him and all the whole world in our toppes. Therfore we must do our indeuer to fight manfully, yt we giue not place to our enemies nor runne away intoo our enemies camp like cowardly traitors. For no man shall bée crowned excepte he performe his chalenge lawfully. 2. Tim. 2. a 5. A. Wherefore let vs put on the armor of God, that wee may be able to make resistance in the euill day, and to stande when all is done.The reward of weldoing. Ephe. 6. c. 13. Shall inherit all things. M. That is too wit, immortalitie and the residue of the indowmentes as
well of body as of mynde, and full suffizance of the fountaine of life. S. Truely a right great and notable promisse of re∣wardes. What Emperor or Generall in the fielde hath béene or euer shall bée able to promise so great things to his Soul∣diers? He shall (saythe he) inherite all thinges: namely heauen and earth and whatsoeuer good things are conteyned in them both. For what is it that he hath not, which posses∣seth God himselfe, whose the earth is and the plentie thereof? I will be his God (sayth he) and he shall be my Sonne. P.The elect are heires of all good things. Héere he mencioneth that begetting whereof the Apostle sayeth, By∣cause yée bée sonnes, God hathe sent the spirite of his sonne intoo your heartes, which cryeth Abba, father. Galathi. 4. a. 6. And hée that hathe God for his father, is become heire of all the goodes which are his, for if wée bee sonnes, we be heires also. Rom. 8. d. 17. Wherefore there is no doubt but all things are subiect to the godly, Psal. 8. b. 6.7.8. or euen their very af∣flictions doe continually further their welfare. Rom. 8. e. 28. And this is borowed out of the promise made vnto Dauid. 2. Samuel. 7. b. 14. & Psalm. 89. d. 27.28. 8. But the fearefull, and vnbeleeuing, and the abho∣minable, and murderers, and vvhoremongers, and sor∣cerers, and Idolaters, and all lyers shall haue theyr parte in the ponde that burneth vvith fyre and brimstone, vvhich is the second death. But the fearefull, and vnbeleeuing. A.Cowardlinesse is blamewor∣thy in al chri∣sten folk, but specially in the ministers. Lyke as the holy Ghost by the mouth of Iohn, comforteth all the godlie: so dothe hée manace vtter destruction to the vngodly. And he calleth those fearefull and vnbeléeuing, which beléeue not Gods promyse, whereby he assureth his seruants that he will be present with them and succour them: but willingly yéeld themselues into shamefull bondage of the aduersarie powers, for feare of im∣peaching their goods, their name, or their person. For vnbeléef is alwayes accompanyed with faynthartednesse. But they that trust in the Lord, shall bée like Mount Sion which remo∣ueth not. Psa. 125. a. 1. A. Truly fearefulnesse is a foule thing in
all Christen men, and specially in the ministers of the word, whose dutie it is, not only to mainteine the things hartily & stoutly which belong to Christs kingdome, but also to hartē others to do the same. Whervpon Paule writeth thus vnto Timothie: I giue thee warning to stirre vp the gift of God which is in thée by the laying on of my hands. For God hath not giuē vs the spirit of fearfulnesse, but of power, and of lo∣uingnesse, & of sobrietie. 2. Tim. 1. b. 7. P. Also Iames saith, AThat is, a∣fearful or co∣wardly man. Who be ab∣hominable. dubbleminded mā is vnconstant in all his wayes, Iames. 1. b. 8. And the abhominable. He termeth thē abhominable, who after the knowledge of the truth, do not only slide backe frō it by Apostasie, but also become most deadly enemies thereof, biting & blaspheming it with their currish chappes: & finally which abhorre the truth, & are likewise abhorred of God who is the truth. For abhominable signifyeth any thing that the stomacke lotheth or abhorreth. Concerning such lothely & ab∣hominable creatures, looke Mat. 12. d. 45. & Heb. 6. a. 4.5.6.7.8 &. 2. Petr. 2. d. 20.21.22. Therefore we must regard, not what pleaseth the worlde, but what pleaseth God, least wee vouch∣safe chéefe honour vpon those whom God doth worthely ab∣horre. M. For this saying of oure Sauiour is well knowen: That whych is hyghly in the fauour of men, is abhominable before God.Who be mur∣derers. Luke. 16. d. 15. And murderers. A. That is too wit, with tung, mind, hand, or by withholding of things néedfull. Of which sort bée those Caynish Giantes, and those great mē of name like Nimbrod the strong hūter, which murther gilt∣lesse persons at their pleasure, and make them as shéepe to ye slaughter. Which thing no mā doth more cruelly at this day than doth the Romishe bishop the Vicar and stepfolower of that most méeke Lambe, and the successor of Peter, whom Christ commaunded to put vp his sword. And there be other of the chéef prelates also which are very diligent in folowing the example of this Romishe Bishop. But God will abhorre those bludthirstie & deceitfull mē.Who be whoremon∣gers. Psal. 5. b. 6. And whoremon∣gers. A. Of whom it is written in another place, that they shal
not inherit the kingdome of heauen. 1. Cor. 6. b. 9. & Eph. 5. b. 5. Also, whoremongers and wedlockbreakers God will iudge, Hebre. 13. a. 4. S. What can our singlemen bark ageinst this, which make great braggs of the chastitie that they haue pro∣mised eyther by vow or by othe taken by laying their hande vpon the holie Gospells, thinking that they shall escape the cryme of periurie, bycause they forbeare the lawfull com∣panie of women in wedlocke, thoughe they play the arrant whoremaisters all the whyle? But (as the prouerb saythe) they make their reckening withoute their hoste. That is too say, among such iudges as themselues bée, they be denounced chaste and kéepers of their othe: but before the true iudge, they bée not so. A. For thus must wée beléeue: namely yt whor∣dome is cursed of God, and that stayednesse is the gift of God, which whosoeuer is not indued wythall, must mary in the Lorde, accordyng too the Apostles saying, He that hath not holde of hymselfe, let him marie. For it is better too marie than to bée burned. 1. Cor. 7. b. 9. And sorcerers. S.Who be sor∣cerers. Whither yée take Sorcerers for such as gyue men slabersauces to drinke, or suche as bewitch men with trickes of inchauntment, too intyce them too the loue and reuerencing of them: it scarce∣ly agréeth too any men more ryghtly in all Christendome, than too the Romishe Byshops themselues, and too those that haunt that holie Court of Rome. And hereof are dy∣uers kindes, of which Moses speaketh in Deutr. 18. b. 11.Who be Ido∣laters. And Idolaters. M. That is too say, whyche preferre any thing before the loue of God, or which presume too worship God wyth any superstitious seruice not warranted by his worde. For thus saith the Lord, Whatsoeuer I commaund you, that take you héede vntoo, that you doo it: Too this thou shalt adde nothing, from this thou shalte take nothing. Deut. 12. d. 32. And Paule writeth of Idolaters in this wyse, Who when they knewe God, glorified him not as God, nor were thankefull, but fell to fondnesse in theyr owne imaginations, &c. Romanes 1. c. 21. And all lyers. M. In woorke or woorde,Who be lyers. or in feyned
holinesse throughe custome or of set purpose. S. Of which sort they be, which go aboute to impeache Christes Religion or the good name of their neybours by vntruthes. For they bée borne of the diuell ye father of lies. Iohn. 8. f. 44. Shall haue their part in the pond that burneth with fire and bstone.The reward of the wicked. M. By these words he betokeneth vnstaunchable paine & excéeding great stinche. And he calleth it their part, in sted of their heritage or peculiar possession: according to this texte, He shall rayne snares, fire, brimstone, and whirlwyndes vppon the vngod∣ly, the portion of their cup. Psalm. 11. b. 6. And of the vnthrifty seruaunt it is sayde, The mayster of that seruaunt will come on a daye that he lookes not for him, and in an houre that he knowes not of, and he wil cut him a sunder, and giue him his portion with hipocrites. Math. 24. d. 50.51. A. Wherby we ga∣ther that all wicked and heynous persons haue the reward of their sinnes prepared in a readinesse for them. VVhich is the second death.What the se∣cond death is, and who shall receiue it. He calleth that the second death, which Daniell calleth euerlasting reproch & shame, Dan. 12. a. 2. And which Christ calleth hel fire, & endlesse paine. Mat. 5. d. 22. &. 20. d. 46. And marke well, yt with those wicked folk, which are cursed, yt is to say, abhorred of God, & with those murtherers, whore∣mongers, sorcerers, Idolaters, & lyers, he matcheth also the fearfull & vnbeléeuing, least any mā might suppose, that such maner of peines are prepared only for those grosse & heynous sinners. A. For most true & certein is this saying of Christes, whosoeuer denieth me before men, him will I also denie be∣fore my father which is in heauen. Mat. 10. d. 33. Therfore we must indeuer, yt looke what we haue beléeued with our hart, wee may vnfearfully confesse the same with our mouth, as oft as neede shall require. 9. And there came vnto me one of the seuen Angels vvhich had the seuen Violes ful of the seuē last plagues, and he spake vnto me, saying: Com, I vvill shevv thee the bride the Lambes vvyfe.
And there came vntoo mee. &c. A little erst,A description of ye Church. he sayde he had séene the holie Citie Ierusalem prepared and garnished by God: which thing he spake in generall: and nowe he openeth the matter by specialties. Vpon whose reporte wée take the bryde the Lambes wyfe to bée the Churche it selfe (that is too say, the multitude of them that beléeue) whereof the Citie of Ierusalem beareth a representation. M. And by those seuen Angells are vniuersally ment all preachers of the Churche which set themselues ageinst Antichrist and his clawebacks, bycause that whatsoeuer they teache or preache, they receiue it of Chryst. Full of the seuen last plagues. A. Whereof hath bin spoken héeretofore. 15. b. 7. And he spake vntoo mee. Altogither in vaine shoulde the Vision bée, if the woorde went not wyth it too instruct, as I haue sayde oftentymes alreadie. Come,The Churche militant and the strait cup∣lyng vntoo Christ. I will shewe thee the bryde the Lambs wyfe. M.P. That is to say, the Church as yet warfaring and making hirself redie to imbrace hir husbande Christ. For by the similitude of the bryde and brydegrome, is betokened that moste tender and vncessant loue betwéene Chryst and his Churche, whereof Salomon speaketh in his ballets, 1. a. 1. A. By reason wherof Paule min∣ding to betoken the most straite cuppling of Chryst and hys Churche, hathe more than once vsed the similitude of the bride and bridegrome, and of man and wife. 2. Cor. 11. a. 2. and Ephe. 5. e. 25. 10. And he caryed mee vp in the spirite too a great and a high mountaine: and shevved mee the great Ci∣tie, holy Ierusalem, comming dovvne out of Heauen from God. And he caried me vp. &c. C. This vision is placed last,The Church triumphant. bicause that when Christs enemies be destroyed, there remaineth no∣thing else to bée séene but the peaceable and quiet reigne of Christ, which is described vnto vs vnder the figure of a most excellent Citie, singularly well fortifyed, safe from all foes, and inlyghtened with the bryghtnesse of the Lorde. And by
this description is shewed vnto vs the prerogatiue of Gods people, and how déere and precious they be in his eyes. For if our vnderstanding be vnable to atteine to the description of that earthly Citie whiche is shewed to the Prophet vnder the figure of the Temple, Ezech. 10. how shall we be able too comprehend the blissednesse of the godly, which is hidden vn∣der this description? And therefore Iohn was caried vp in the spirit into a greate high mountaine, whiche betokeneth vnto vs mount Sion that butted vpō the Citie of Ierusalem. Of which mountaine the prophet speaketh thus.Mount Sion. B.P. And in the Last dayes it shal come to passe, that the mountain of the Lords house shall be set vpon the top of all mountaines, and be lifted vp aboue all hills, and al nations shal flocke thither, and much people shall come and say, Come & let vs go vp too the hill of the Lord. Esai. 2. a. 2.3. G. This mountain is not hor∣rible but tractable, and offereth vnto vs the swéete promises of the Gospel according as the Apostle saith: yée are not come too the Mount that is touched, and vntoo burnyng fyre, nor yet too storme and darknesse, and tempest, and sounde of Trumpet, and voyce. &c. B. But yée bée come too Mount Si∣on, and too the Citie of the liuing God, the heauenly Ieru∣salem, and too an innumerable sight of Angels. &c. Hebre. 12. e. 18. f. 22.The Catho∣like Church is greate, And he shewed mee the great Citie. M. That is to wit, The Catholike Churche, whiche consisteth of all hir Citt∣zens. S. And truely it is a great one, fyrst bycause it is the Ci∣tie of the great King: Secondly, for the innumerable multi∣tude of Gods people, whych is is greater than all peoples of the earthe both in estate and in worthinesse. Deutr. 4. a. 7. And moreouer bycause the Churche is dispersed throughe the whole earth. A. according too the word of oure Sauiour, I tell you (saith he) that manye shall come from the East and from the West, and sit downe with Abraham, Isaac, and Ia∣cob in the kingdome of heauen. Mat. 8. b. 11. And Caiphas pro∣phesyed that Christ should die for the people: and not onely for the people, but also to gather together the Chyldren of
God that were dispersed. Iohn. 11. g. 51. Holy Ierusalem. S.Why the Church is called holy, wherwithal is shewed the operation & right vse of baptime. So is the Church called, bycause the holy and terrrible name of God is called vpon in hir, & he doth also sanctifie hir: that is to say, he maketh hir strong and vtterly impregnable, though she be neuer so much assaulted by ye power of hir aduersaries. A. For he hath giuē himselfe for hir, that he might sanctifye hir, after he had clenzed hir by the washing of water through his word, too the end he might set hir by himselfe a glorious Churche not hauing any spot or wrincle or any suche thing, but that she myght be holy and vnblamable. Ephes. 5. e. 26.27. F. What manner of one Christ found his Church, it is set foorth by E∣zechiel in his sixteenth Chapter. That is to wit, he found hir altogither forlorne, wallowing in sinne, ouerfraughted wyth filthinesse, and stinking. Yet did he not loth hir, nor cast hir in the téeth with hir vnclennesse, nor vpbraid hir with his owne purenesse: but tooke hir vp and washed hir from hir filth, and C. redéemed hir wyth his death, a peculiar worke of hys owne whych it is not giuen to any man to attaine vntoo to do the lyke. A. For it is onely Christ that hath rescued vs from death by giuing his owne lyfe for vs. And the manner of his lo∣uing and sanctifying hir is shewed in that Paule sayth by the washing of water: for thereby he doth vs to vnderstand, that the pledge of holinesse is giuen to the Church by baptim: which thing agréeth wyth thys saying of Christ, he that beléeueth and is baptised shall be saued. Mark. 16. d. 16. C. And where∣as Paule sayth we bée washed by baptim, hys meening is that God doth thereby both witnesse our washing, and there∣withall also performe the thyng that is figured. For ex∣cept the truth or performance of the thing went iointly with the signe of it, it were an vnproper spech to say, that baptim is the washing of the soule. And by the way we must beware,A good war∣ning. that we put not ouer that thing either to the signe or to ye mi∣nister of ye signe, which is proper vnto God only: that is to say, that we think not the minister to be the author of washing vs
cleane, or the water to purge the filthinesse of our soule: which to doo, belongeth only vnto Christs blud. Agein we must take héede that no péece of our trust doo sticke either to the water or too the man, forasmuch as the only right vse of the Sacramēt is, too leade vs streight by the hand vntoo Christ, and there too stay. G. For it is onely the holy Ghost that reneweth & quicke∣neth vs, and no creature or outwarde worke is able too bring that to passe. For if Circumcision do nothing auaile in Christ. Gal. 5. a. 6. Surely neither auaileth it any man too be but only dipped in water and too bée admitted intoo the Church, except he haue fayth that is workefull by charitie: whiche thing the powring on of water performeth not, for then should all that bée baptized bée faythful. And therfore there is added, through the worde. For what else are Sacramentes,Sacraments. than seales of the worde? Take away the worde, and all force of the Sa∣cramentes is gone. C The onely word then is that which ma∣keth the difference betwéene the Sacramentes of the Godly,No due ob∣seruation of Sacramentes among the papistes. and the deuises of the vnbeléeuers. Wherby it appéereth that there is no due obseruation of Sacramentes among the Pa∣pistes. For they beast themselues too haue the word, howbeit as which serueth them but for an inchaūtment, bycause they mumble it vp in an vnknowen tung, in such wyse as though it were directed too the deade element rather than too men. As for opening of the Mysterie to the people, (whyche is the onely thing that maketh the dead Element too beginne too bée a Sacrament) they vse none at all.Wherfore Christ ma∣keth his Church holy. E. And this place maketh full ageynste the Anabaptistes whyche imbace the estima∣tion bothe of Baptime and of the worde. Nowe remayneth the ende wherefore Chryst Sanctifyeth hys Churche: and that is, C. that wée shoulde lyue holie and vnblamable vntoo God. For Chryste hathe not clenzed vs too the ende wée shoulde tumble backe ageyne intoo oure vncleannesse, but too the ende wée shoulde all oure lyfe long holde faste the clennesse which wée haue receiued at his hand. And wheras Paule sayth, that Christ shoulde make the Churche glorious
too himselfe: he méeneth that she should be holy in the sight of the Lord and not in the opinion of men. A. So also in another place he saith, he chose vs in him (that is to say, in Christ) be∣fore the foundations of the world were laid, to the ende wee shoulde be holy and vnblamable before him through loue. Ephes. 1. a. 4. G.How the Church is vnspotted. And albeit that Paule do call this spouse of Christe vnspotted and not berayed with any wrincles or molles: yet doth it not follow that the faithfull sin not, as the vnskilfull Anabaptists chatter. For then had Iohn bin a ly∣er in writing, If we say we haue no sin we deceiue ourselus, and the truth is not in vs. 1. Iohn. 1. b. 8. And whereas ye same Iohn saith, he that is of God sinneth not, neither can sin. 1. Iohn. 3. b. 9. And whereas Paule telleth vs that Christes Church is vnblamable: the cause is this, that although the godly and the faithfull be sinners, and do dayly offende, yet notwithstanding their peacemaker and bridegroome Iesus Christe layeth not their sinnes to their charge, by reason of their wedding garment, that is to say, of their beléefe in him. A. Wherefore those that by this and such other like places do go about with the Pelagians to proue the perfectnesse of the Church in this life, they may be disproued without any trou∣ble. G. For Paule in that place, declareth not what is already done, but to what end Christ hath clenzed his Church. Now then if a thing be saide to be done, to the ende another thing may ensue afterward, it is a folly and a fondnesse to inferre, that the latter thing which must insue is already done. And yet I denie not but holinesse is already begon in the Church: but they do amisse to ground perfection there whereas is but dayly forwardnesse to it. 11. Hauing the glory of God: and hir brightnesse vvas like a most precious stone, euen as a Iasper cleere as Cristall. Hauing the glory of God. S.The glory of ye rightuous, That is to say stored with hea∣uenly goodes, and shewing foorth a heauenly conuersation in
all things. Or else, if ye like better to refer it to the happie state of the godly which they shall haue hereafter, it betoke∣neth the glory of immortalitie shining in the bodies of the chosen: A. according to this saying, Then shall the righteous shine as the Sunne in the kingdome of their father. Math. 13. f. 43. S. Also, we looke for our sauiour Iesus Christe, who shall transforme our bace body, to make it shapelike to hys glorious body. Phil. 3. d. 20.21. Also, whensoeuer Christe our life is manifested, then shal you also be manifested with him in glory. Colos. 3. a. 4. We are sure that when he appeereth, we shall be like vnto him: for we shall sée him as he is. 1. Iohn. 3. a. 2.A description of the happie state of the Church. And hir brightnesse was like a most precious stone. When the Prophetes méene to describe Christs spirituall kingdome, and the happie state of the godly in time to come, which vtterly exceedeth al mans capacitie: they vse wonder∣full inlarging, borowed, surmounting, and comparing spée∣ches, and chéefly taken of such things as men are wont to set most store and price by. So reade we in Esay of the excee∣ding happie state of Ierusalem: Inlarge the place of thy Pauilion (saith hee) and stretch out the Canuas of thy tents. spare not. Set thy Cordes further out, and make thy stakes fast. &c. Esay. 54. a. 2. The like thinges almost are had in E∣zech. 40. a. 4. & in Zachar. 2. a. 2. Yea and in expresse wordes they often foretell that all Nations shall come vnto Christe, and that he shall reigne euen to the vttermost boundes of the earth. Moreouer they make mention of wonderfull large and high walles made of perles: and also of watersprings, of Riuers, of the wood of life, and of such other like things, for which men are wont to estéeme and commend Cities. All which things auouch first the strength and stedinesse: second∣ly the garnishment, and pleasantnesse: thirdly the fruteful∣nesse and plentie of all good things: and moreouer the peace and surenesse of Christs kingdome: partly in this presente life, but most fully in the life to come, when we shall bée lyke vnto him, and shall sée him as he is, and haue swéete talke
with him face to face.Faith and Christes Gospell. The brightnesse then whiche is com∣pared to most fine Iasper as cleere as Cristall, is the lyght of faith, that is to saye, the most pure and stedfast doctrine of Christ, whiche putteth away the darknesse of all errors, ac∣cording as Christe witnesseth, saying: He that followeth me walketh not in darknesse, but shal haue the light of life. Iohn 8. b. 12. A. Therfore like as a Iasper stone is cléere and greene, so the Church is gréene in faith and hope, & fast grounded in Charitie. A. For ye faithfull are such as no man can cōplaine of them, the pure children of God, vnblamable in the middes of a leawd and crooked generation, among whome they shine as Cressets in the worlde, carying about the worde of life. Phil. 2. c. 15.16. In respect whereof, in another place they bee called light in the Lorde. Eph. 5. b. 8. Cleere as Cristall. M.The clennesse of the chosen sorte. That is to say shining as bright as Cristall. For like as no vnclen∣nesse can lye hid in a Cristall by reason of his cléerenesse: e∣uen so the Catholike Churche béeing purged from all filthi∣nesse by Christ, shall shine with great brightnesse, A. that is to wit, it shall be in all respects holy, perfect, and faultlesse, or vnblamable. Eph. 1. a. 4. &. 5. f. 27. 12. And it had a vvall great and high, vvhiche had tvvelue gates, & at the gates tvvelue Angells, & names vvritten, vvhich are the names of the tvvelue tribes of the children of Israell. And it had a wall. G.The strong∣nele of the Church, and hir safe de∣fence. Like as the Citie is saide to be strong which is well inuironed with high walles: so is the Churche very well fortified, inasmuch as it hathe and acknowledgeth God to be hir protector: according as it is writtē, As for Ieru∣salem, the mountaines are round about it, and the Lord is a∣bout his people from this tyme forth for euermore. Psalm. 125. a. 2. A. Also, the Angell of the Lorde incampeth rounde a∣boute them that feare him, and deliuereth them. &c. Psalm. 34. b. 7. Also, hée hathe giuen his Angelles charge of thée to be
with thée, and to kéepe thée in al thy ways. Psal. 91. c. 11. G. Al∣so, I haue set watchmen vppon thy walles O Ierusalem, which shall neuer hold their peace al the day and al the night long. Esay. 62. b. 6. S. Also, and I will be a fyrie wall round a∣bout him, saith the Lorde. Zachar. 2. b. 5. By which borowed spéech it is meant, that Christs Church is vtterly impregna∣ble, and that the gates of hell are able to do nothing agaynst it. Math. 16. c. 18. Great and high. G. q. d. No enimie is able too enter the Citie, bycause the walles be higher than that the e∣nimies can haue any way to the Citie. And therefore the god∣ly may safely hoord vp treasure there, séeing no théefe cā come néere to take away his treasure. For there is farre distance betweene the faithful and ye faithlesse, that is to say betwene the Citizens of the heauenly kingdome, and the Citizens of the world which is set all vpon naughtinesse. 1. Iohn. 5. d. 19. VVhich had twelue gates.The gates of Christes. Churche. The Patriarkes or chéefe fathers of housholdes, by whome the true worshipping of the one God was successiuely conueyed to posteritie, are rightly likened vnto Gates: according as Iohn himselfe expoundeth it in this place, saying: And names written which are the names of the twelue trybes, of the children of Israell. For (as Christe saythe) Saluation commeth of the Iews. Iohn. 4. c. 22. Also, if the roote be holy, the braunches are holy too. Roma. 11. b. 16. In which respect, ye may also take it to be meant of the very A∣postles. For the number of twelue is the number of vniuer∣salitie. Therefore like as a man may enter into any Citie by ye gate of it: euen so may we also atteine to the true know∣ledge of God, and come to Christ who is the very gate of sal∣uation, by the promises made to the fathers, and by the doc∣trine which the Apostles preached to the world. And at the gates,The mini∣sters of Gods word & their duete. twelue Angelles. G. By these Angells are betokened all ministers of Gods worde. For it is their office to bring the beléeuers into the Church by the ministration of the worde, and to kéepe the vnbeleeuers out of it. A. And therefore the keyes of the kingdome of heauen are deliuered vnto them, to
the end they should open and shut, loose and bind, and release or withhold sinnes according to Christs commaundemente: as it is written in Math. 16. c. 19. and. 18. c. 18. & Iohn. 20. e. 23. G. Besides the things that we haue said already of the names that were written, All the electAll the electe. may be vnderstoode by the names of the twelue tribes of the children of Israell. For all of them be the children of Abraham through faith, according as Paule teacheth. Rom. 9. b. 8. &. Gal. 4. d. 28. And this is a thing specially to be marked, that as oft as the Prophetes make mention, either of the Temple, or of the Arke in the Tabernacle, yea or of the people of Israell from the destruc∣tion of the Temple: all is referred to the spirituall Israell, that is to say, to al them that are the children of God through faith in Christ. Now then like as in the description of thys Citie, there are set downe twelue gates, whereby is meant, that al the chosen haue accesse set open for them to the Citie: so also it behoueth vs to know, that out of what nation soe∣uer in the whole world they come, whither they be Iewes or whither they be Gréekes, they be let in, without any respect of persons, and their names are registred vp in the Citie, that is to wit, they themselues be admitted and receiued for Citizens. 13. On the eastsyde three gates: On the North side three gates: On the Southside three gates: and on the VVest side three gates. On the Eastsyde three gates. S.The maner of entering into the Church. Christs Church is a Citie dis∣persed through the whole world, whereinto who so will en∣ter, must needes enter by beléefe in the father, the sonne, and the holy Ghost. By this faith therefore there entereth an ex∣céeding great number of beléeuers into the Church from all four quarters of the world, according as our Sauiour Christ said, Many shall come from the East and from the West. &c. Math. 8. b. 11. A. Also, from the days of Iohn Baptist vnto thys day, the kingdome of heauen suffereth violence, and the vyo∣lent
do pull, it vnto them. Math. 11. b. 12. G. Iohn séemeth too haue had an eye to the same seuerall lodging of the people of Israell, whereof Moses maketh mention. For it was Gods will to haue the twelue tribes of Israell to be deuided into four parts, in such wise as thrée tribes pitched their tentes on the Eastside of the Tabernacle, thrée on the West side, thrée on the North side, and the other thrée on the South side throughout the bandes of their whole hoste. Numb. 2. a. 3. Whereby he meant to do them to vnderstand, that the glo∣rie of his name should not be inclosed within any one place, but shoulde be blazed abroade farre and wide through the four quarters of the worlde, according as Iohn sheweth in this place. 14. And the vvall of the Citie had tvvelue founda∣tions: and in them the names of the Lambes tvvelue Apostles. How the A∣postles be the foundation of the Church.And the wall of the Citie had twelue foundations. G. Although this strong and impregnable wall be Gods euerlasting and vnchangeable election: yet notwithstanding the Lorde she∣weth, that the witnesse of this election is faith, and the obey∣ing of his word. For this cause Iohn witnesseth héere, that the Apostles are as it were the foundations of the wall of this Citie, bycause all our hope and all the assurance of our soulehealth consisteth in their doctrine, which the holy Ghost sealeth vp in our harts. And albeit that Christ be the true & only foundation of the Church, in sted whereof it is not law∣full to lay any other. 1. Cor. 3. c. 11. Yet notwithstanding for asmuch as he hath ordeined the ministration of his word as a certain meane wherby we be builded spiritually, and that the Prophets, and Apostles were the ministers of this word: it is not vnaduisedly said, that the Church is founded vppon the groundworke of the Prophets and Apostles, that is too wit vppon the doctrine whiche the Prophets and Apostles haue taught vnto the world by the commaundement of God.
Wherevpon, Paule writing to the Ephesians, to the ende he may proue them to be Citizens of ye heauenly kingdome & the houshold meinie of God, calleth them backe to the foun∣dation of faith, saying: Now therefore ye be no lōger straun∣gers and alients, but felowcitizens of the Saincts and Gods houshold meinie, builded vpon the foundation of ye Prophets and Apostles, Iesus Christ himselfe being the cheefe corner stone. In whome what building soeuer is closed togither, the same groweth to a holy temple in the Lord, in whom yée also are built togither for a dwelling place for God, through the spirit. Eph. 2. d. 19.20.21.22.Christ is the foundation of foundations. Christ therefore may be called the foundation of foundations, howbeit that in very déede hée is the only one foundation alone: like as he is also called the holy of holyes, & the shepherd of shepherds, whereas these ti∣tles of holy & shepherd agree properly to none but him. More∣ouer the faith or beléefe of the forefathers & of the Prophets & Apostles is vtterly al one: namely that Christ is the Lamb which taketh away the sinnes of the world.Faith is the foundation of the Church. This Rocke is the foundation of the Church. Vpon this Rocke (saith he) wil I build my church. Math. 16. c. 18. The fathers, the Prophets, the Apostles, yea and all true beléeuers are builded vppon this foundatiō. 1. Pet. 2. a. 5. And in this place we sée,The autoritie of the Church dependeth vp∣on ye doctrin of the Apostles. that the authoritie of the Church dependeth vppon the doctrine of the Apostles, for asmuch as ye same is the foundatiō of ye Church. Which thing fighteth manifestly against suche as refuse too credit the scripture of ye Gospel, furtherfoorth thā it is allowed by the Church. But the certeintie of Gods word doth in no wise depend vpon men: but rather is sorted out from mennes doctrines by a certaine secret force & power of it owne. And this power is perceiued by the working of ye holy Ghost: who sealeth Gods promises in the harts of the faithfull, so as they shake off lyes, and are sure of the truth of the doctrine whych they folow. But héeretofore it hathe come to passe through the wilinesse of Satan, that in sted of Gods pure worde, mennes inuentions, or rather diuellish deuises haue bin
brought in, yea and also receiued vnder pretence of the name of the Church, not without excéeding great losse of mennes Soules. 15. And he that talked vvith me, had a golden reede to measure the Citie vvithall, and the gates therof, and the vvall therof. And he that talked with me. S. By this Réede is rightly vn∣derstood the beleefe of Gods word,The beleef of Gods word. which beléefe is called gol∣den, both bycause it is of al the things the worthiest and pre∣ciousest, and also bycause it must be tryed by the fire of afflic∣tion: according as Peter sayth, To the intent that the proofe of your faith, which is much preciouser than golde (which pe∣risheth and yet is tried by fyre) may be found to your prayse, and glory, and honor at such time as Christ shall be reueled, 1. Pet. 1. b. 7. S. Of this rule of faith the Apostle writeth thus: As many as walke after this rule, peace and mercie be vpon them and vppon Israell that perteineth to God. Gal. 6. d. 16. Also, according as God hath delt vnto each man ye measure of faith Ro. 12. a. 5. B. And Iohn alludeth to Ezechi. 40. a. 4. and to Zacharie. 2. a. 2.Christ giueth vnto ech man boh faith and other gifts by measure. To measure the Citie withal. M. That is to say, to giue vnderstanding of the scriptures, gifts of the spirite, and works of faith, whereby men come to eternall life, euen vnto the meaner sort of Christians according to the measure of his owne good pleasure. S. It appéereth therefore that the master builder of this Citie is Christ, who by his spirite im∣parteth vnto ech man the measure of faith and of gifts agrée∣ing to his charge. And by the Citie we vnderstand the com∣pany of beleuers: and by the walles and gates, we vnderstād the ministers of the word,Apostles, tea∣chers, Magi∣strates, and Angells. namely the Prophets, Apostles, and Teachers, whiche set themselues manfully as walles & bulwarks against the enimies of the truth. Furthermore, thereby also are meant all faithful princes and magistrates, whome Christ himselfe and his Angelicall spirites assist, and ayde in their incounters. A. For their owne authoritie were
not auaylable ynough of itselfe, vnlesse they were vnder∣propped with the help of God: and in likewise the ministers of the word being hemmed in with so many daungers, should neuer be able to stand vpon their feete, if they were not pre∣serued by the power of God. 16. And the Citie vvas built four square, and the length vvas as much as the bredth of it. And he measu∣red the Citie vvith his reede, tvvelue thousand furlōgs. And the length and the bredth and the heigth of it vvere all alike. And the Citie was built foursquar. S.The stable∣nesse of Chri∣stes Church. This foursquarenesse of the Citie betokeneth stedinesse and the continuall stable∣nesse of the Saincts through God which preserueth it. A. For nothing is able to hurt them, whome God the father hath de∣liuered to the kéeping of Christ. Rom. 8. f. 31.The largenes of Christes Church. And he measured the Citie. S. The numbers of twelue and of a thousand, are the numbers of vniuersalitie and perfection: whereby is meant, that the largenesse of Christs kingdome shall be stretched o∣uer all the world: according as it was foreprophesyed by E∣zechiel, 40. a. 4. G. No maruell then though this Citie be greate and large, sith it conteyneth now so innumerable a multitude of the faithful: for thus was it said vnto Abraham: In thy séede shall all nations of the earth be blissed. Gen. 22. d. 18. And the length and the bredth and the heigth. &c.Three ver∣tues be in ech one of ye chosē. For a∣fore hée had sayd it was made foursquare. And he doth vs too vnderstand, that there is no man of the warfaring Church, be he of neuer so bace estate, but he hath thrée vertues: that is to wit, faith, hope, and Charitie, according to the degree of his calling. For it is not of necessitie, that as many as belong vnto this Citie, should beléeue, hope for, and loue the blissed life all alike. For faith hope and Charitie haue their degrees and yet can no man attayne saluation, except he hold fast the catholike faith, and except he dye in ceasitie, and except hee hope for the eternall life: not with a certeine wauering opi∣nion, but with a stedfast persuasion.
17. And he measured the vvall thereof, a hundred fortie foure Cubits, after the measure of man, vvhich is the Angelles measure. The largenes of Christs kingdome or of ye Church.And he measured the wall thereof. S. I haue warned you of∣tentimes already, that in this booke we must not sticke su∣perstitiously to the numbers, but rather marke the mysteries that lye hid vnder them: which thing appéereth most euident∣ly by this present place. For if ye refer the twelue thousande furlongs to all the four sides at once, each side shall be of thrée thousand furlongs a péece.A common Cubit. Moreouer, a hundred and four and fortie Cubites, whither ye allow them to be of the lesser syse, (which conteineth a foote and a halfe to euery Cubit) or why∣ther ye take them of the greater syse, (which are called Geo∣metricall Cubites,A Geometri∣call Cubit. and conteine sixe Cubits a peece of the les∣ser sorte, that is to wit, nine foote apeece) make not vp a iust furlong.A furlong. For a furlong conteineth a hundred and fyue and twentie paces, that is to say six hundred and fyue and twentie foote. How then shall a hundred and four and fortie Cubites make the full space of twelue thousand furlongs, (for he sée∣meth to plat out the whole circuit of the Citie in both those numbers) except ye take those numbers after some mysticall manner? Twelue therefore. beeing multiplyed by twelue, make a hundred fortie and four, which is sayd to be the num∣ber of the chosen, Héeretofore. 7. a. 4. and. 14. a. 1. Then by such mysticall numbersMisticall numbers. (that is to witte of twelue thousande furlōgs, and of a hundred and four and fortie Cubits) he ment to shew, that the number of the chosen shoulde be excéeding great, and consequently that the Citie of Ierusalem (whyche representeth a patterne of the Churche or of Christes king∣dome) shall be exceeding large. Which selfsame kingdome is said in the Psalmes and Prophets to be extended to the vt∣most boundes of the earth, and that the inhabitantes thereof which shall resort thither from out of the whole world, shall not be able to be numbered for multitude. Whervpō Baruch
speaketh to Gods people after this manner: O Israell, how great is Gods house, and how large is the place of his inheri∣tance? It is greate, yea it hath none end, it is large and vn∣measurable. &c. Baruch. 3. c. 25. Now if ye take the things that be spoken heere, to be meant of the heauenly Ierusalem that is to come: ye must consider the misticall reason of these num∣bers much more. After the measure of man, which is the Angells. G. It is to be noted héere, that the measure of the Temple of Ierusalem whiche was shewed to the Prophet, was farre greater than this which is described héere by Iohn.The measure of the Sanc∣tuare. For the measures of the Sanctuarie, and of the things that belonged to the temple, were of a greater syse than the measures of the thynges that perteyned to the people.The measure of man. By reason heereof hee saith, that thys measure was the measure of man, bycause it was lesse than the measure of the Temple. Or else it is cal∣led the measure of man, bycause the measurer of the Ci∣tie appéered to Iohn in the shape of a man. S. Vnlesse ye had leuer to take it in this sence, The measure of man and Angell, so as ye should vnderstand it, that men are led by the same spirit that Angels be led, and that all one glory of happinesse is prepared for them both, A. According as Christe saith, the righteous shall shine as the Angels in the kingdome of theyr father. Math. 13. f. 43. 18. And the building of the vvall of it was of Iasper∣stone: and the Citie itself vvas puregold, and like vnto cleere glasse. And the building &c. S. By this comparison he betokeneth,The beautie and gorge∣ousnesse of Christs king∣dome. that Christes kingdome shall bée not onely strong, but also maruellous beautifull and trimly garnished: for such is both the faith and conuersation of the Saincts in the Churche. M. Then if any of Christes band be made a defender of other men against Antichrist, he hath that prerogatiue through the stedfastnes of faith & through the cheerefulnesse of ye doctrine
of the Gospel. Afterward Iohn procéedeth to treate of ye stuffe whereof the Citie was made, that is to say of the whole com∣pany that shall be in the Citie of the kingdome of heauen. And the Citie itselfe. S. We reade that in King Salomons time, there was great plentie of Gold in Ierusalem, and that there was nothing in the temple, whiche was not either of massie gold, or ouerlayd with gold. 1. Kings. 7. g. 49. But here the Ci∣tie itselfe is reported to be cleane gold: whereby is most eui∣dently shewed the excellencie of the Church in comparison of the Synagog: according to this saying of the Prophet, I will make all thy children taught of God. Esay. 54. f. 13. Also, hée that is lesser in the kingdome of heauen, is greater than Iohn Baptist. Math. 11. b. 11. Wherevnto perteine also the thynges that Paule hath in the. 2. Cor. 3. b. 8. And like vnto cleere glasse. By these words he sheweth that the beautie of the Churche shall be vtterly incomparable, hycause the faithfull shal sauor all one thing, M. G. and giue light vnto others by example of good works: according as Christ exhorteth, A. saying, Let your light so shine before men, as they may sée your good workes, and glorify your father whiche is in heauen. Math. 5. b. 16. 19. And the foundations of the vvall of the Citie vvere garnished vvith all manner of precious stones. The first foundatiō vvas a Iasper: the secōd a Saphyre: the third a Chalcidonie: the fourth an Emeravvd. The beautie of Christes Church & the noble and ex∣cellent giftes wherewith it is endued.And the foundacions. G. By these foundations are signifyed all the Apostles and ministers of Gods word. For they bée in the myddes of the people, sending foorth a brightnesse of godly lyght through purenesse of doctrine and soundnesse of lyfe. A. Neuerthelesse it may be taken for the whole companye of the godlye in generall, who sauoring all one thing, and through charitie striuing to gyue honor one to another, ap∣ply their seruis to the edifying of the Churche and of their brethren, according to the gifts that are graunted to them. Concerning which looke Rom. 12. b. 6. and so to the end of that
Chapter &. 1. Cor. 12. a. 7. and so to the end of that chapter and Eph. 4. b. 11.12.13.14. &c. G. For like as the stones that be rec∣kened héere, are not all of one preciousnesse: so all Gods gifts are not bestowed vpon euery of the faithfull alike, but vntoo ech one according as séemeth good to the holy Ghost the de∣stributer of them. 1. Cor. 12. b. 11. Notwithstanding,Gods pro∣mises. some haue by these foundations vnderstood Gods promises and assuran∣ces: concerning whiche, the Prophete speaketh thus: The iudgemēts of ye Lord are truth and righteousnesse, and there∣withal more to be desired thā gold, yea than much fyne gold &c. Psal. 19. c. 11. Therefore this wonderfull description of the foundations, sets before our eyes the beautie and excellente glory of Christ. And the same shyneth forth most euidently in the Churche, as well in Christe the head of it, as also in hys members, albeit that the vngodly being blinded with vnbe∣léefe, can in no wise perceiue it. The first foundation was a Ias∣per. S. He méeneth twelue kindes of precious stones, whereof the foundations of the walles of the Churche be made, & they be in a manner the same stones which are reported to haue bin in the Brestlap of the high préest. Exodus. 28. c. 15. B. And wherewith the Prince of Tyre was decked in Ezechiel. 28. c 13. according to ye thréescore & twelue Interpreters, though not altogither in the same order. M. And the Iasper stone is set first in Gods foundation, bycause it is of this nature.The Iasper stone betoke∣ning faith. It is of colour gréene, and he that beareth it about him feareth no sprights. This stone betokeneth them that always hold fast the faith of God, and neuer shrinke from it, ne feare the de∣ceites of the Diuell, who notwithstanding goeth about lyke a roring Lion séeking whome he may deuoure. 1. Pet. 5. c. 8. And this vertue is conteined in the first Article of the Chri∣sten beléefe, where it is said: I beléeue in God the father Al∣mighty. And this article or (namely that this God the Crea∣tor of heauen and earth is only to be worshipped and profes∣sed, yea and that vncorruptly and faithfully) was figured in Iuda the chéefe of the twelue patriarks, which name signify∣eth
cōfessing or acknowledging.The Saphire betokening hope. The second a Saphyre. G. This stone is like the cleere skye, which being striken with ye sun-beames casteth forth a burning brightnes. And it betokeneth the highnesse of the hope of holy mē, whose conuersatiō is in heauen. Phi. 3. d. 20. and who being renued by the true sunne, do the more earnestly séeke euerlasting things, and teache o∣thers to do the same.The Chalce∣donie betoke∣ning charitie. The third a Chalcedonie. This stone hath the colour of a dim Candle. It shineth abroade, and is darks within dores. It wil not be cut by any ingrauing, it casteth foorth beames of a fingar long, and draweth chaffe vnto it. It betokeneth the flame of the inward charitie of the Saints, who shine but dimly abroade, and yet they resist all priuie vnderminings. For in the troubles of this world, their cha∣ritie is strong and vnable to be appaired, but when it is wil∣led to profit other folks, then it appeereth what brightnesse it hath within.The Eme∣raud betoke∣ning our Re∣demption. The fourth an Emeraud. This stone is exceding gréene, aboue all herbes and leaues: in somuch as it maketh euen ye very aire about it gréene. Héereof are many kyndes, but the preciousest is found in ye countrie of Sichimie, which is desert and vninhabitable by reason of extreme cold. And these stones are kept by Griffons, not for themselues but for men: for armed men fyght against them, and take them from them. The Diuel is this Griffon, who laboreth to take from vs the Iewel of our redemption, bestowed vpon vs by Christ in the coldnesse of his excéeding sore passion, that is to wit, of his infirmitie take vppon him for vs, through the freshnesse of his inuincible courage. 20. The fifth a Sardonix: the sixth a Sardonie: the se∣uenth a Chrysolythe: the cyght a Berill: the nynth a Topas: the tenth a Chrysoprace: the eleuenth a Iacint: and the tvvelfth an Amethist. The Sardo∣nix betokenīg patiēce, pure∣nesse and low∣linesse.The fifth a Sardonix. M. A Sardonix is of diuers colours: blacke in the bottome, white in the middes, and red in ye top. Euen so the saincts are red through sufferance of aduersities and troubles, white by inwarde purenesse of conscience, and
blacke or despised in themselues through lowlinesse.The Sardine betokening martirdome. The sixth a Sardine. This stone is all of one colour like bloud: and it be∣tokeneth the glory of martyrdome after the suffering of the martirs themselues. The seuenth a Chrysolyte.The Chriso∣lite or Gold∣stone betoke∣ning ye know∣ledge of Gods mysteries. The Berill betokning the grace of ye holy Ghost. The Topas betokening Christen lyfe and doctrine. This stone glistereth like gold, & casteth out burning sparkles. Wherby are meant those that vnderstand the diuine scriptures, & both in word & worke, do vtter that vnto others which they them∣selues vnderstād. The eight a Berill. This stone glistereth like water whē the sunne shineth vpon it, & it is saide to heate the hand of him yt holdeth it. It betokeneth mē enlightened wyth the grace of the holy Ghost, which bring others to the loue of heauēly things by preaching & teaching the same grace. The ninth a Topas. This stone is of ye rarer and preciouser sort, & hath two colours, the one of gold, the other of Yuorye. It shy∣neth with greatest cleerenes whē it is touched with ye bright∣nesse of ye sunne, and it passeth all Iewels in cléernesse, singu∣larly prouoking the beholders to looke still vpon it: and thys stone betokeneth such as shine in Christen life and doctrine. Therfore it betokeneth ye chosen sort which are predestinate to saluatiō out of al nations, of whom is made the body of the Catholike Church. The tenth a Chrisoprace.The Chriso∣prace betoke∣ning charita∣ble intercomo∣ning. A Iacint be∣tokening spi∣riuall wis∣dome. This is of a gréene colour intermedled with gold. And it betokeneth suche as re∣semble the freshnesse of the euerlasting countrie by charitable intercomoning one with another. The eleuenth a Iacint. Thys stone resembleth ye aire: In faire wether it is shéere, & in foule wether it is dim. G. And it signifyeth ye spiritual wisdom wher∣through ye faithful know how to aply thēselues aright to mat∣ters and persons acording as Paule exhorteth, when he saith, Applying yourselues to the time. Rom. 12. c. 11. A. Also, behaue yourselues in such wise as ye may giue no offence, neither to the Iewes nor to the Gētiles, nor to the Church of God: like as I please all men in all caces, not seeking mine owne profit but ye profit of many, that they may be saued. 1. Cor. 10. g. 33. The twelfth an Amethist. M. This stone is red as a rose,The Ame∣th st betoke∣n ng the euer∣lasting life and ca∣steth certain litle flames. And it signifieth yt the blissed sort are crowned with an vnappairable & flaming crowne of euer∣lasting
life, which shall continue always as fresh and red as a Rose, time without end. 21. And the twelue gates were twelue perles through∣out them al: euery gate of one pearle. And the streete of the Citie vvas fyne gold, like thurrovv shining glasse. And the twelue gates were twelue pearles. G. After Iohn hath shewed vpon what trust and by what way,The enterāce into Christs kingdome. men that couet to be partakers of the euerlasting happinesse, must come to the true communion of Saincts: he sheweth consequently what the enterance of the spirituall Citie is: namely, that it is the Lords word, whereby the gate is opened vs into the Church of God.One Me∣diator. Euery Gat of one pearle. By the one Pearle though the gates be many, héere is betokened that there is but one mediator betwéene God and men, euen Iesus Christ, who is the dore, the way, the truth, and the life. Iohn. 10. b. 9.14. a. 6. And the streete of the Citie was fyne gold.The inferior sort of the Churche. By the stréete of the Citie, are meant the simpler sorte in the Churche, who are rightly compared to thurrowshining gold, by reason of their pure and plainmening faith: and vnto a stréete or pauement, bycause they cleaue togither by the Cement of Charitie. Like thurrowshining glasse.The purenes of Christes Churche. That is to say, hiding no filth in them. By beholding of whome, the euill men may both knowe and amend their owne faults, like as he that looketh in a glasse perceiueth the spottes of his owne face. As if Iohn shoulde say, Only those dispose themselues to be the stréete of the Ci∣tie Ierusalem, (that is to saye to be of lowest degrée in it) which hold themselues in loue towardes God and their ney∣bor, which kéepe themselues from spottinesse of sin, whyche wash away their spottes (be they neuer so light) by fayth, re∣pentance, prayer and teares: and whiche shine before all o∣thers in example of good works. 22. And I savv no Temple in it: for the Lord God almighty and the Lambare the Temple of it.
And I sawe no Temple in it. Héere we sée manifestly,What maner of Temple and preestod is among Christians. that a∣mong Christans ther is no outward Temple, like as there is no outward préesthod, nor sacrifyse for sinnes, (according as is sayd héertofore. 20. b. 6.) sauing the temple which Iohn spea∣keth of héere, and Paule in the. 1. Cor. 3. d. 17. &. 6. d. 19. Which thing Christe himselfe also witnesseth in Iohn. 4. c 23. For which cause it was his will that the Temple of Ierusalem should be beaten downe to the ground least we might put our trust in the same or in any like, and so bée tyed vnto places. S. Therfore wheras Suffricanes beare men in hand that they halowe Churches,The popish halowing of Churches. it is nothing else but mans inuention, be∣witching the simple people with their wonderfull supersti∣tion. That euē from the times of the Apostles, there haue bin places dedicated vntoo God, which by some were called Ora∣tories or places of prayer, and by othersom, Churches, where collections or gatherings were made some one day of ye wéeke and wherin the Christen people assembled to héere Gods word and to receiue the Sacrament of the bodie and blud of our Lorde: we are informed by the Epistles of the Apostles, and also certified by the doings of the holy fathers. And although those places wer clensed with salt, yet were they not anoyn∣ted with Oyle, neyther had they any Alter of stone yet stand∣ing in them for a shew, besmeared with oyle. And this do the Papistes themselues witnesse in the Breuiarie of Rome, in the office of the dedication of Churches. Wherby appeareth that which I haue said, namely that it is but mans inuenti∣on. Which thing neuerthelesse, they father vpō Siluester the first Bishop of Rome of that name, too the intent that Anti∣quitie may make the Ceremonie of more credit. For the Lord God Almightie. A.God is the Temple of the faithfull. God is loue (sayth Iohn in the fourth chap∣ter and sixtéenth verse of his first Epistle) and he that dwel∣leth in Loue dwelleth in God, & God in him. Ergo, God is the temple of the faithfull: for the faithfull dwell in him & rest in his goodnesse and prouidence. And likewise agein the faith∣full are Gods Temple: bycause God dwelleth in them, and
ruleth them at his pleasure. And the Lambe. That is too saye, Christ the verie sonne of God. Hereto perteyneth that which is sayd in another place: namely, That which wée haue séen & herd wée declare vntoo you, that you also may haue felow∣ship with vs, and that we may haue felowship togither with the father and with his sonne Iesus Christ. 1. Iohn. 1. b. 3. Also our sauiour sayth, If a man loue mee, he will kéepe my say∣ings: and my father will loue him, & we will come vnto him, and make our dwelling with him. Iohn. 14. c. 23. 23. And the Citie hath no neede of the Sunne, nor of the Moone to shyne in it. For the glorie of the Lorde inlyghtened it, and the Lamb is the lyght of it The peculiar riuiledge of the Church of Christ in the vse of hys benefytes.And the Citie hath no neede. &c. G. These things are boro∣wed out of the prophesie of Esay, who in describing the hap∣pie plight of the Church, saith. The Sunne shall no more bée thy light adayes, neither shal the light of the Moone shine vp∣on thée: for the Lord will bée thy lyght for euer, and thy God will bée thy glorie. Esai. 60. d. 19. C. By which words the Pro∣phet assureth vs, that the happinesse of the Churche shall not bée for a time onely, but for euermore. For he sholeth it out from the common state of mē, among whom nothing is sted∣fast or continuall. For there is nothing vnder the Sunne, (bee it neuer so well settled) whiche is not subiecte to diuers chaunges. But the Church must not bée déemed by the perills of this present life: for shée shall bée preserued euen in the middes of the waues. As if a man should say, Value not thy welfare by the present countenance of things: but assure thy selfe it is layde vp safe in God. God will bee thy Sunne, so as thou shalt not néede too borowe lyghte of the Sunne or of the Moone. Feare not then any chaunge or alteratiō of thy state: for thou shalte haue an euerlasting and vnchaungeable light. The Prophet meaneth not by these words, that the children of God shall bée refte of the common benefytes of this life. For sith the Lorde graunteth them fréely too all men with∣out
exception: no doubt but he hath ordeyned them for the godly also. Nay rather God hathe created all things for their sakes, bycause the Lorde hath a peculiar care of them. But the Prophete mente too betoken some greater bene∣fyte whyche the onelye Chyldren of God inioy: that is too wit, the heauenly lyght, whyche as the vngodly haue ha∣ted, so also can they not receiue it. For althoughe they haue the vse of the Sunne and of other benefites: yet can∣not their felicitie bée stable and stedfast. And therefore these woords doo put a difference betwixte the state of the Church, or the godly, and the common state of all other men, least we myght measure it by the alteration and interchaungeable∣nesse of the worlde. For (by putting a parte for the whole,) vnder the name of the Sun and ye Moone he comprehendeth the whole state of man, whiche is alwayes chaunging. The same thing meaneth Iohn when he saythe, And the Lambe is the lyght thereof. S. Yea truely, Christ is the Sunne of rygh∣tuousnesse, which inlyghteneth his Church with the bryght∣nesse of his word.Christ is light in himself and giueth light to the world. For he is ye true lyghte whyche inlyghte∣neth all men that come intoo the worlde. Iohn, 1. a. 9. Whatsoeuer is lyghtsome eyther in Heauen or in earthe, it boroweth lyght from else where: but Christ is light of him∣selfe, shyning of himself, and gyuing lyght to the whole world with hys bryghtnesse, so as there is not any other cause or originall of lyghtnesse but hée. Like as all things haue their lyfe, mouing and beeing by him: so also is he the lyght bothe of men and Angells: of men I saye, but not of beasts, bicause they haue not a reasonable soule whereby too sée wisedome as man hathe, who béeyng created after the Image of God, hathe a reasonable mynde whereby he maye bée able too conceyue wisedome. For this lyght that is spoken of here,What our light is. is not the Sunlyght which inlyghteneth the outward eyes of the bodie: but the heauenly light wherwith the eyesight of ye mind is inlightened, yt it may see (that is too say, know) God. This is the light that shineth in darkenesse, & the darkenesse
comprehendeth it not, Iohn. 1. b. 5. Wherby wée be done to vn∣derstand, C. that the light wherwith men were indued at the beginning in their creation, is not too bée valewed by their state as it is now, bycause that in this corrupted and vnkind∣ly nature, our light is turned intoo darkenesse. But yet is not the light of vnderstanding quite quenched bycause there gli∣stre as yet a fewe little sparkes of that brightnesse in the mis∣tie darknesse of mans mind. M. Christes Godhead and maie∣stie therfore are discharged of all blame, in asmuch as he hath shone vpon men continually as a most bright Cresset,The faulte of ignorance is in our selues. and all the fault of not knowing God is too bée wyted vpon mennes owne blyndnesse. For this light shyneth still in the world: and mens mindes myght bée brought by it too the knowing of the liuing God, if they were not ouerwhelmed with darkenesse, that is too wit with blindnesse of mind, vnbeléefe, misbeléefe, vngodlinesse, and vnknowing of God. For like as blind eyes receiue not the light of the day: so this lighte of lyfe is not re∣ceiued of darkened mindes. A. And like as the daylight is pre∣sent with him that is blynd, and yet is absent from his eyes, euen so the light of life is present with mē, & yet their minds being ouershadowed with darknesse comprehend it not. C. For since the time that man was estraūged from God, ignorance hath hild his mind so ouerwhelmed, that whatsoeuer light re∣maineth therein, it lyeth choked without effect. Which thyng is proued by dayly experience. For euen they that bée not regenerated by gods spirit (in asmuch as they haue some pre∣heminence of reason still,) are an assured proofe that man is created, not only to liue, but also to vnderstand. Yet notwith∣standing,  this reason of theirs is so far shorte of guiding them vnto God, yea or of comming any thing néere him, that all the vnderstanding thereof is nothing else but méere vanitie. And therefore it is to be considered, that the myndes of men which be vnregenerated by the holy Ghost, are by an enforce∣ment of speeche or rather by a full similitude, called, not dark but darkenesse. And why not, sith that the things that cōcerne
God and consequently wherin eternall lyfe consisteth, being set before the naturall mā most openly and certeinly, (namely euen by Gods word,) are vnto him but foolishnesse, and he is not able to knowe them. 1. Cor. 2 d. 14. C.The partes of naturall reason. Moreouer the partes of this lyght that remayneth still in corrupted Nature, are chéefly two. For there is naturally growing in euery man some séede of Religion: and also there is ingrauen in their con∣sciences a certein discerning of good and euill. But what frute commeth of this geere, but that Religion degenerateth into a thousand sorts of superstition, and the conscience vtterly ouer∣turneth al iudgemēt, so as it confoundeth vyce and vertue to∣gither? To be short, naturall reason will neuer leade men vn∣to Christ. And whereas they be indued with skilfulnesse to gouerne this lyfe, and wheras they be borne to noble arts and learning: all that vanisheth away also without frute, vntill suche time as they be regenerated againe in Christ by ye wor∣king of the holie Ghost.Two opera∣tiōs of enligh¦tening in Christ. For there be in the sonne of God two distinct operations of inlyghtening. The one is that whiche appéereth in the workmanship of the worlde & in ye ordering of nature: the other is that whereby he renueth and esta∣blisheth the nature that was decayed. The first is by nature, the other is by grace. There is no man but he hathe some in∣sight of the first inlyghtening, that is to say, some reason and power of vnderstanding dwelling in him: but of the seconde none are partakers saue only the Elect: for no man commeth vnto Christe except the father drawe him. In respect héereof Christ himselfe sayeth, I am the light of the world, he that fo∣loweth me shal not walk in darknesse, but shal haue the light of lyfe. M. Now if Christ be the lyght of the world, then is the whole world in darknesse and in subiection vnto Satan, so as neyther the reason nor the powers of man haue any lyght in them, vntill they haue it at Christs hand. And this lyght was promised long ago by the Lorde God in his scriptures, like as when it was sayd, The Lord hath sworne the truth vnto Da∣uid and he will not go from it, I will set of the frute of thy
womb vpō thy throne, for the Lord hath chozē Siō & is min∣ded to make it his seate. There wil I make the horne of Da∣uid to bud, I haue prepared a light for mine anointed. Psal. 132. b. 7. And in Esay, the father saith: I haue giuē thée too bée the light of the Gentils, that thou maist hée my saluation too the vtter most coastes of the earth.The office of inlyghtening must not be restreyned to the persone of Christes manhod. What it is to folowe the lyght. Esai. 49. b. 6. C. Neuerthe∣lesse it is to be noted, that ye operation & office of inlightening must not be restreined vnto Christs person. For he is absent from vs in bodily sight, but yet he vttereth his light vnto vs dayly, by the doctrine of his Gospell, & by the secret working of his spirit in vs. R. And to follow this light is to beléeue in Christ. BV. For this light is receiued by faith, & so doth Christ become our light and shineth in vs. For they that folow him shal not walke in darkenesse, that is to say, they shal not wal∣low in wickednesse and sinne, which are called the workes of darknesse, Rom. 13. d. 12. but they shall haue the light of lyfe. Moreouer the Prophets,How the Apo∣stles, and all true preachers are the lyght of the world. Apostles and all the true preachers & teachers are said to be the light of ye world, Mat. 5. b: 14. not bicause they be the very light it selfe, but bicause they bée the blazers abrode and witnesses of the true light, & bicause they set forth the Gospel which chaseth away the darknesse of the world.The faithful are called lyght. Finally also C. all the godly are called light in ye Lord, Ephe. 5. b. 8. bycause that béeyng inlightened with his spirite, they not only sée to their owne behoofe, but also direct others by their good example into the way of life. 24. And the people that are saued shall vvalke in the light of it, and the Kings of the earthe shall bring their glory and honour into it. Who are par∣takers of the heauēly lyght.And the people that are saued. That is too saye, the people whom God hath determined to inlightē with the brightnesse of his worde, and for whom eternall lyfe is prepared. G. For by these wordes Iohn sheweth, that all men without excepti∣on shall not be partakers of this benefite, but the chosen one∣ly: euen they vpon whom God shineth with his frée fauor, yt
they may bée exempted from the common sorte. And this is done by Christ, who is called the Sunne of rightuousnesse, bi∣cause wee bée inlightened (as yée woulde say) by his beames. S. So is it saide in another place. And they beleeued, euen as many as were ordeined to eternal life. Act. 13. g. 48. Shal walk.The spred∣ding abrode of the Gospel. &c. A. This also is taken out of Esay. S. The Lorde (sayth he) shal rise vpon thée, and his glorie shal bée séene vpon thee. And the Gentils shal walke by thy light, and kings by the bright∣nesse of thy rising. Esai. 60. a. 2. G. In which place the Prophet preacheth of the spirituall light & brightnesse. For in Christs spirituall Kingdome, the lighte of the Gospell hathe shyned through all partes of the world, and the vtter most Nations haue bin inlightened with it. And hereby wée gather, that the only light of man, is to haue the Lord shine vpon them by his word. Certesse al men graunt it so to be: but yet they set not so muche by the benefite, as they ought to doe, but take it as some common thing, that may agrée naturally vnto all men. But the Prophet sheweth this thing too bee a supernaturall grace, A. and therefore it ought too bée distinguished from Na∣ture. And the kings of the earth.Kings and Princes shall come to the knowledge of the Gospel. G Kings are set downe here by name, like as they be by the Prophet Esai. 60. a. 3. Least any man might thinke that none shall come to this light but the rascall sort only, wheras euen Princes and great men shall come, who otherwise stande greatly vpon their reputation. S. Which thing was partly fulfilled immediatly after ye time of the Apostles, and so forthe from the time of Constantine the great: and all the godly doo with great longing looke for a fuller accomplishment therof heereafter. G Exceeding great truly is the honor that is giuen to the Church, that she should shine with so great brightnesse, as too drawe whole Nations and kings vntoo hir. And it is called the Churches light, not bicause it hath any light of it self, but bicause it boroweth hir light of Christ, as the Moone doth of the Sunne.
25. And hir gates shall not be shut by day: for there shall be no night. The happi∣nesse and abū∣dant riches of the spirituall Citie.And hir gates shall not. &c. S. Many suppose that héere is pro∣mised the great peace and safenesse which shall be in Christs kingdome, and they say, that the Church shall be safe & sound vnder the custodie and protection of the Lord: For the stāding open of the gates sheweth that there is no daunger at all. Howbeit for asmuch as these words of Iohn be taken out of the Prophesie of Esay, and the mind of them both séemeth too be all one: we must seeke out another méening. For thus is it written in the Prophet: And thy gates shall stand open con∣tinually, they shal not be shut day nor night, that the riches of the Gentiles may be brought into thée. Esay. 60. b. 11. G. Héere the Prophet séemeth to expounde himselfe: namely that the gates shall stand open for the bringing of riches into the Ci∣tie from all places rounde about. And whereas cariages are wont to be made adaytimes: the day (saith he) shal not suffice: so great shall the concourse of them be that shall bring theyr loading into it: and therefore there shall be continuall cari∣age, so as the gates must be fayne to stand open day and night. A. After this manner doth Iohn shewe the happinesse and a∣bundance of this spiritual Citie, when he sayth that the gates shal not be shut adaytymes. q.d. Continually shall some come and enter into that Citie, bringing somewhat with them. For there shal be no nyght. That is to say, the concourse of them that shall resort to this Citie shal be so great, that the nyghttyme shal not differ at al from the daytyme. G. And wheras the pro∣phet sayeth that there shall be the riches of the Gentyles: it must not be referred vnto fleshly superfluitie, but to the obe∣dience and seruisablenesse which the whole world shall yéeld vnto God in his Churche. Which thing Iohn confirmeth in the next verse, saying:
26. And they shall bring the glorie and honour of the Gentyles into it. 27. There shal not come vvithin it any thing that de∣fyleth or vvorketh abhominacion and maketh lyes: but onely they that be vvritte in the Lambs booke of lyfe. And they shall bring. &c. A.The glorie of the Church. Like as in the foure & twentith verse he had said of the kings, that they should bring their glo∣rie & honor into hir: So speaketh be now also of the glory and honor of the people: to ye end we may know, that the Church shal be glorified by al meanes. Into it. G. That is, into the Ci∣tie, which is the Church. That which is offered vnto God is said to be the Churches, bicause that God in ye behalf hath no∣thing seuerall frō it. A. And therfore Paul said, glory, honour, and peace to euery one yt doth good Rom. 2. b. 10.Who be admit¦ted into yt hea∣uenly Church and who bee excluded. There shal not come within it any thing. &c. G. The kingdome of Heauē it shet ageinst vnbeléeuers, blasphemers, cursed persons, & suche as walke after the flesh, but it is opē to the elect & called saincts. And Iohn speaketh of the inwarde Churche. For in the out∣ward Church the good and bad are commonly mingled togi∣ther. Mat. 13. b. 30. Here vpon Iohn said they went out from a∣mong vs, but they were not of vs. &c. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 19. A. And Christ spake to Nicodemus after this maner. Verily I say vnto thée, Except a mā be borne frō aboue, he cannot sée the kingdome of God: & onlesse a man be borne of water and the holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God. Iohn. 3. d. 3. S. Wherby it appéereth therwithall what Moses ment in the law whē he said, he that hath his stones rent or brokē, or he that hath his yard cut off, shall not enter into the congre∣gation of the Lord. &c. Deut. 23. a. 1. Or worketh abhomination.Workers of abhominatiō. A. That is to say, which yéeldeth himself to sin, and misliketh not himselfe, but goeth on still in his wicked déedes. For the spirit that gouerneth the Church is the spirit of holinesse, and not of vncleannesse or abhomination. And maketh lyes.Lyers. Accor∣ding to this text, Thou shalt destroy all thē that speake lyes.
Psal. 5. b. 6. For none are reckened for Gods childrē, but such as loue the truth, according to Christs saying, Euery one that is of the truth héereth my voyce. Iohn. 18. p. 37. But only they that be written.The elect. That is to say, none but those that be chosen & foreordeyned from the beginning, vntoo the euerlasting lyfe that is promised in Christ. As for the Lambes booke of lyfe, we haue spokē of it alredie in the eyght verse of the thirtéenth Chapter héertofore. The two and twentith Chapter. ANd he shewed me a pure riuer of liuing water, clere as cristal, proceeding out of the Seate of God and of the Lambe. The cōteints of this Chap∣ter.ANd he shewed me. A. In this last Chapter Iohn sheweth, yt the word of the Lorde (to whom all honour & glory is due) is the true and whollfe salue of the soule, and yet that it profileth none but ye chosen and beléeuing sort, but is deathful to the vngodly and vnbeléeuers. Also he openly denounceth vt∣ter damnation to all the corrupters and skorners of Gods word:The pleasant∣nesse and com∣modiousnesse of ye spirituall Citie. all which things do not a little commend this prophe∣sie among all godly folk. A pure riuer. .G After Iohn hath she∣wed the maner of building of the spirituall Citie, now he she∣weth how & by whom the same is ruled, & therwithall what fruts it bringeth forth. And first in saying that he sawe a pure riuer, he sheweth the plesantnesse of the place, and the health∣fulnesse of the inhabiters. A. And he alludeth to the ryuers of Paradyse,Baptim. whiche watered the whole earthe. Genes. 2. b. 10. B. There be whiche referre this ryuer to the Sacramente of Baptim,Paradise. acording also as they do the things that are spokē of ye glassie sea heretofore. 4. b. 6. wherwith sundrie texts of the prophets do agrée, which beare witnesse of the grace of Christ offred vnto vs in baptim.Chrystes doctrine. But more rightly do others vnder∣stand it to be the force of the doctrine of Chrysts spirit: accor∣ding as Iohn speketh Iohn. 4. b. 10. & 7. f. 38. G. For the hearts
of all the godly be watered with the streame of Gods woord, so as they being clenzed by faith,Gods heauēly comforts. are acceptable to god for Ie∣sus Christes sake. S. Neuerthelesse, this may fitly be referred to that most plentiful abundance of Gods comfortes, where∣with the heauenly father wil comfort his children: according to this text, The welspring of lyfe is with thee. Psalm. 36. c. 9 Also, thou shalt giue them drinke of the brook of thy pleasure. Psal. 36. c. 8. And again, Thy comforts haue chéered my soule according to the multitude of sorowes in my heart. Psal 94. d. 19. Also, they that sowe in teares shall reape in ioy. Psal. 126. a. 6. Of which happinesse the Church representeth a figure in the meane whyle, in lykewyse as the olde synagoge preten∣ded a resemblance of the Churche, that is to saye, of Christes kingdom. We haue much more lyght and truth reueled than the men of old time had, and yet haue we much lesse than shal be in the blissed life to come: in comparison wherof, the things that we haue now, are yet but as certain shadowes & figures: according as Paule sayth, Our knowledge is vnperfect, and our prophesying is vnperfect. 1. Cor. 13. c. 9. A. Also, déer beloued now are we the children of God, and yet it hath not appéered what we shall be: But we are sure yt when it appeareth, we shalbe like him. For we shall see him as he is. 1. Iohn. 3. a. 2. S. Finally Iohn seemeth to haue borowed this whole descrip∣tion out of Ezechiel. 36. e. 25. of Liuing water,The pure∣nesse of Gods word. Looke in the sixte verse of the .xxj. chapter heretofore. Clere as cristal. He saith this bicause Gods worde kepeth alwayes his brightnesse. Wher∣vpon Dauid saith, The cōmandemēts of the Lord are right∣ful, and make the heart glad. The preceptes of the Lorde are pure & giue light to the eies. Psa. 19. c. 9.The doctrine of ye Gospel is the doctrine of God. But this brightnes is séen only of the chosen. Proceding out of the seat of God. G. Thē the doctrine of the Gospell whiche bringeth forgiuenesse of sins, proceedeth not from men, but from God: according as Christ witnesseth very often, yt the doctrin which he preached was not his own, but god yt fathers, by whō he was sent Iob. 7 c. 16. & 8. e. 42. &. 14. d. 24. A. not ye Christ techeth one thing, & the father an other thing: (for God forbid yt we should so diuide
Christ from his father:) but forasmuch as Christ beyng very God and also very man, taught men with manly voyce: least any man might thinke his doctrine to be but mans doctrine, bicause it was published by a man: he saith it is sent vs from his heauenly father, euen by him who hath bin ordeined frō thn beginning to be the true mediator betwixt God and men. And of the Lamb. S. We sée how Iohn doth alwayes match the lamb equall with the father, in that he maketh the seate of God and of the Lamb to be but both one. A. Then let no man followe the wicked opinion of Seruetus, in doubtyng of Christes Godhead, séeyng it is auouched by so manie textes of Scriptures, 2. In the middes of the Streete of it and on eyther syde of the riuer, there vvas vvoode of lyfe, vvhich bare twelue frutes, yeelding his frute monthly: and the leaues of the vvoode [serued] to heale the people vvithall. The tree of lyfe.In the middes of the streete of it. G. By the stréete of the Citie is betokened the whole congregation of the godly, which our Lord Iesus Christ ruleth, and in the middes of whom he sit∣teth to helpe them, and in the end to giue thē euerlasting life. S. And Iohn alludeth to the fifth verse of the sixe and fortith Psalme, & to the fourth verse of the eight & fortith Psalm, but specially to the gardē of Eden, in the middes wherof was the the trée of lyfe, Gene. 2. b. 9. The mysteries wherof, Iohn dis∣closeth trimly in this place, saying, VVhich bare twelue fruites yeelding his fruite monethly.The frutful∣nesse of Chri∣stes Church. S. Fortunate are those Ilands and happie are those Countryes counted, whole soyle and trées beare fruite twice a yeare. Moste happie therefore shall the soyle of our Citie bée, which yeldeth frute, not once or twice at the moste within the compasse of the yeare, but twelue times, where euery moneth hath his springtime & Haruest. Moreouer it is knowen that in certein Psalmes a rightuous mā is likned to a trée plāted by the riuers of running waters and yeelding his fruite in due season. Psalm. 1. a. 3. and. 52. a. 8.
That wood of lyfe then in the middes of the Citie (that is too wit, of the Church,Chryste is the tree of lyfe. which is Christs kingdom) is Christ him∣selfe the destroyer of death, who quickneth whom he listeth. Iohn. 6. d. 51. For in him is the originall of al life, or rather he is the very life of al that liue, in whō we liue, moue, & be.The branches of the tree of lyfe. Act. 17. f. 28. Of which tree the branches are ye Prophets, Apostles, Euangelists, shepherds, & Teachers, which are euer gréene, and bring forth most plentifull & vncorruptible frutes, as wel of holy doctrine, as of holy life, through euery moneth, that is to say without ceassing, as long as they liue heere: whereby mans frailtie is refreshed among the sundry aduersities & la∣bors of this world: namely whē it is vndershored with beleef & hope of ye promises of our most kind harted father, & refre∣shed with a certein tast of yt exceeding gret louingnesse which he hath vttered vnto vs in his only begottē son Iesus Christ, through the oftē beating of these things into vs by suche ma∣ner of mē. A. Therefore we must not be wéery of wel doing,Of liberalitie & good doing. but while we haue time we must doe good vnto all men, but specially vnto thē that be of the houshold of faith. L. That is to say, as long as we liue in this world we must neuer cease too exercise liberalitie with great cheerfulnesse. E. Our good doing must not be tyed to the circumstances of persons, places, or times. L. We must deserue wel at al mens hands, and folow the steppes of our heauenly father, E. which maketh his Sun to rise vpon both good and euill, and raineth downe vpon the righteous & vnrighteous, Math. 5. g. 45. & Luke. 6. e. 36. S. And forasmuch as wee bée not alwayes of abilitie to deserue well of all men by our good dooing: wée must specially haue a re∣garde too them that bée of the householde of faythe, that is too wit, too them M. that bée of the Christen profession and beleef, among whome, the first are the ministers of Gods woorde, and after them, all other beléeuers in their state. For com∣mon manhood maketh vs detters vntoo al men: but with the faithfull wée haue a néerer bond of kinred which the Lorde hath halowed among vs. R. Also there is an order to bée kept
euen among the housholdfelowes of faith, so as we must doo wel by our owne children, and then to our kinsfolke and such as haue done wel by vs, A. (for he that is carelesse of his own familie or houshold, is worse than an Infidell. 1. Tim. 5. b. 8.) R. and lastly also vntoo all others. So must wée neuer be wée∣rie of dooyng good. For now is the time of good doyng, whyle Chryst shyneth vpon vs by the lyght of his Gospell, and the time of our Haruest shall bée in the worlde too come. If wée sowe héere in the fleshe, we shall reape corruption there: and if wée sowe héere in the spirit, wée shall reape eternall lyfe there.What it is to sowe in the flesh and what to sowe in the spirit. C. Too sowe in the fleshe is too prouyde for the néedes of this present lyfe without regarde of the lyfe to come. R. It is too bée all for a mans owne selfe, too féede his owne paunch onely, and too bestowe nothing too the mayntenance of the spirituall functions. Also too sowe in the flesh is too follow the fruites of the fleshe and to pamper the fleshly lustes. And too sow in the spirit, is too looke more to heauē than to the earth, and so too frame a mans life as he may séeke alwayes for the kingdome of God. For we sow in the spirit when we do and suffer all things in this life, to the ende wée may bée well at ease in the lyfe to come.Among whō Christ shew∣eth his health∣ful power. G. And it is to be noted, yt like as Iohn saw this fruteful trée in the middes of the stréete of the Citie: euen so Christ sheweth his healthfull power only among the chozē, making thē to bring forth ye frute of good works, wher∣as Satā worketh al the whyle in the stubbornharted childrē, according as Paule teacheth. Ephe. 2. a. 2. And the leaues of the wood serued to heale the people withall.The happi∣nesse of the euerlasting lyfe. The healing of ye peo∣ple is to acknowledge the benefits of their redemptiō, & to be cōtinually occupied in the ye praises of God the father, & of the redéemer, by extolling ye benefits which he hath bestowed not only vpō our selues, but also vpō the whole world, according as it is to be séene in the Psalmes & in the Ballads. For the mind is wonderfully chéered & strengthened by such kind of things. Moreouer, faith is likened vnto ye leaues, bicause that like as ye fruite is preserued among the leaues, euē so faith is
norished & preserued by héering ye word of god, Rom. 10. c. 17. Or else ye preaching of ye word is likned vnto leaues, bicause ye like as leaues serue to smal purpose except there bee fruite with thē: euen so ye outward preaching of the word doth little auaile, onlesse it be made effectual by ye secret operatiō of the holy Ghost, & so bringeth forth frute beséeming ye Gospel, in ye heerers of it: By all these spéeches & descriptions, is simply be∣tokened ye happinesse of the euerlasting life: as if Iohn should say, yt the Church shall haue more pleasure, delight, & happi∣nesse after the general resurrectiō of the fleshe: thā euer Adam had in the earthly Paradise. Gene. 2. c. 15. For like as all men would count that Countrey blissed, which had in it cléere and liuing water, & trées alwayes greene and bearing fruite eue∣rie moneth, whose leaues also were holesome to cure all dis∣seases, so as the inhabitants could neuer be wéerie of ye place by reason of the pleasantnesse of it: euen so the heauenly life being replenished with al pleasures, & vtterly discharged of al heauinesse and sorow, shal bring perfect health with it. 3. And there shalbee no more curse: but the seate of God and of the Lamb shalbe in it, and his seruants shal serue him. And there shall bee no more Curse. A.How the Church is set free from Curse. Rightly is the Churche said to be frée frō all curse, bycause that by receiuing the for∣giuenesse of sinnes offered in Iesus Christ, through faith shée is reconcyled vnto God, and quite & cleane set looce from sin. For he that héereth my woorde (sayth Christ) and beleeueth in him that sent mée, hath euerlasting lyfe: and shall not come too damnation, but is passed from deathe vntoo lyfe. Iohn 5. d. 24. Then is there no damnation nowe for them that bee greffed in Chryste Iesu, whyche walke not after the fleshe but after the spirite. Rom. 8. a. 1. Why so? Bycause Chryste hath raunsomed vs from the curse of the Lawe, when he be∣came accursed for vs, &c. Gala. b. 13. But this Raunsome or Redemption is but onely begonne in this life: and it shall bee
perfected when the darnell that hath bin mingled with the wheate is takē quite away, yt the godly may no longer be sub∣iect to errors, deceits, & vices, but be made conformable in all things vnto Gods will, and reigne pure & vnblamable wyth Christ. But the seate of God and of the lamb shal be in it G. That is to say, the Lord will dwell like a good father among them, and take wonderfull pleasure in them.Wherin the profession of Christen Re∣ligion stādeth. And his seruaunts shall serue him. The professiō of Christen Religiō standeth not in the vnbridled libertie of the flesh, but in the true, pure & law∣ful, seruing of God. For our old mā is crucified with Christ, that ye body of sin might be abolished, so as we may not serue sin hereafter. Rom. 6. a. 6. Also, I beséeche you brethrē by the mercifulnesse of God, yéeld your bodies a liuing sacrifice holy and acceptable vntoo God, which is your reasonable seruice Rom. 12. a. 1. Also, wée are his workmanship, created in Iesu Christ vntoo good woorkes, which God hath prepared for vs to walke in. Ephe. 2. b. 10. Also, God hath not called vs too bée vncleane, but to bee holy. 1. Thess. 4. b. 7. And ageine, Chryst hath giuen himselfe for vs too redeeme vs from all vnrighte∣ousnesse, and too purge vs a peculiar people to himselfe, that wee might bée earnest folowers of good workes. Tit. 2. d. 14. Therfore let no man liue to himselfe, but vnto him that dyed for vs and is risen agein. 2. Cor. 5. c. 15. 4. And they shall see his face, and his name shall bee vvritten in their foreheades. Of the behold¦ing of God as wel in this life as in the lyfe to come.And they shall see his face. A. Our Lord saith in the Gospell Bissed are the cleane in hart, for they shal sée God. Math. 5. a. 8. Which thing is most true, both in this life and in the lyfe to come. In this present life, bicause the faithful behold God with ye eies of faith, whē they looke vpō his goodnesse, mighti∣nesse, righteousnes, louingnesse, & fauor in Christ & by Christ: & in the life to come, which is the endlesse life, they shal sée god as he is. Whervpon Paule said, Therfore are we alwayes of good corage, assuring our selues yt as long as we be at home
in the body, we be wayfaring from God. For we walke by hope, and not by outward appéerance. &c. 2. Cor. 5. b. 6. Also, al of vs beholding the glory of the Lord with bare face, as in a glasse, are transformed into the same image from glory too glory, as of the Lords spirit. &c. 2. Cor. 3. d. 18. Also, we see hym now through a glasse in a riddle: but then we shall see hym face to face. 1. Corin. 13. d. 12. And his name shall be in their for∣heads. M q. d. Not onely in confession of mouth, but also in the behauiour of their whole life, do they frankly and vnseare∣fully professe the seruis of God and of his Christ, before this forlorne world. 5. And there shall be no night there, and they neede no light of Candle nor lyght of Sunne: for the Lorde God giueth them lyght, and they shall reigne for e∣uermore. And there shall be no night there. S.Who haue the true lyght. They that folow Christ the light of the worlde, and imbrace his truth, eschue ye dark∣nesse of errors, and abhor al lying. A. For thus he sayth: Hee y• foloweth me walketh not in darknesse, but shall haue ye lyght of life. Iohn. 8. b. 12. S. And, ye were somtimes darknesse, (saith Paule) but now ye be light in the Lord: walke ye as children of the light. Ephes. 5. b. 8. And they neede no light of Candle.Ther is no darknesse in Christes Churche. A. By these words he signifieth that all things are lightsome, bright, & cleere in Christs Church, for in asmuch as the faith∣full endeuoure alwayes to make themselues allowable be∣fore God, and to please him in all points: they be said to walk in the light like as God himselfe is in the light. For this con∣sideration they are said to haue no néede of forreine light, by∣cause they be not any where in darknesse. For the Lorde God gyueth them light. B. The Lord God which sanctifyeth and ru∣leth them by his spirite, shall giue them light ynough. For God is light, and there is no darknesse in him 1 Iohn. 1. b. 5. And they shall reigne for euermore. S.How the chosē do reigne. The chosen reigne euen now whyle they lyue in this fleshe, and their reigning shall
neuer haue end. For they reigne with Christe in spirit and righteousnesse, framing their whole life according to the wil of God the father. But contrariwise the reigning of worldly Tyrants endureth but a small time, and therefore they are not so greatly to be feared. Psal. 82. b. 7. 6. And he sayd vnto me: These vvordes be faithfull and true and the Lorde God of the holie Prophets hath sent his Angell to shevve his seruantes the thinges that must shortly come to passe. The dignitie, truthe and certeintie of this present prophesie.And he said vnto me: These words. &c. G. Now is set downe the conclusion of this prophesie, wherein Iohn sheweth with right earnest protestation, that the things conteined in thys booke, are not vayne, but most certaine, true, and faithfull. So are the Prophets and seruants of God wont to purchace credite to the doctrine whiche they preache: like as the Pro∣phets do by these words, Thus sayeth the Lorde. And Chryste by these words, Verely I say vnto you, Math. 5. c. 18. Also, my doctrine is not mine owne, but his that sente mee, euen the fathers. Iohn. 7. c. 16. Agein, I came not of my selfe, but hée that sent me is soothfast. Iohn. 8. e. 42. B. Also, the wordes that you haue heard are not myne but hys that sent me, euen the fathers. Iohn. 14. d. 24. and many other of the same sort. Also, Paule an Apostle of Iesus Christ, Rom. 1. a. 1. &. 1. Cor. 1. a. 1. &c. Now then an Apostle bringeth not hys owne message and commaundements, but the messages and commaunde∣ments of him that sente him. Also, God knoweth that I lye not, &c. 2. Cor. 11. g. 31. A. No man therefore ought to doubt of the truenesse of this prophesie, séeing that the holy ghost wit∣nesseth euidently, that these words be faithfull and true. And the Lord God of the holy Prophets. S. q. d. The same Lord God which spake to the holy Prophets in olde time, hath sent hys Angell euen now also, to shew vnto his seruants, (namely to thée and to his Churche) the thinges that shall come to passe
héereafter, to the end ye may endure them the quietlier, & di∣ligently shift yourselues from the crafts, errors, & forgeries of Antichrist, who shall be discouered in his due time. The Prophetes are called holy, bycause their wordes shoulde bee receiued with more authoritie and reuerence, and that they shoulde not be estéemed as their owne, but as the words that God vttereth to vs by them. Whereby we should the rather be warned to shunne the enticemēts of the world, and leade a chast and holy life. That must shortly come to passe. Looke a∣fore in the first verse of the first Chapter. 7. Behold, I come shortly, Blissed is he that keepeth the vvordes of the prophesie of this booke. Beholde I come shortly. A.God himselfe speaketh in and by his ministers. The Angell that talketh with Iohn putteth vppon him the persone of Christe, like as he did héertofore. 1. b. 8. For it is no noueltie for ye ministers to speake now & then as though the Lord himselfe spake. And this nota∣ble warrāt comforteth the godly that be in aduersitie, assuring them that he which shal deliuer them is néere at hand, and (as mē are wont to say) standeth at the dore. A. Concerning which matter looke Luke. 18. b. 8. & Iames. 5. b. 6.8.9. Also looke in the fifth verse of the second Chapter héertofore. Blissed is he that keepeth the wordes of the prophesie of this booke. S.Beware of fals prophets. This is ad∣ded least any man being seduced by false Prophets might leaue the playne méening of the doctrine of the Gospell: or else swarue from the truth for feare of Antichristes ter∣rible threatnings.What it is to keepe ye words of ye prophesie. To kéepe the wordes of the prophesie of this booke, is nothing else but to looke circumspectly to our selues, that we be not by anye meanes withdrawen from the truth of the Gospell, but rather to take héede to this one thing, namely that we worke our saluation with feare and trembling, bending ourselues to the glorye of God a∣lone and to the profit of our brethren, according as Paule admonisheth vs, Philip. 2. b. 12. Also, in this place (like
as often in other places héeretofore) we sée with how greate assurednesse Iohn calleth the words of this booke, a prophesie, affirming the same to haue bin reueled by an Angell sent of God vnto his seruants, verily for their profit. So at the be∣ginning he sayd, Blissed is he that readeth and héereth the words of this prophesie, and kéepeth the things that be writ∣ten in it: for the time is at hand. Héeretofore. 1. a. 3. 8. And I Iohn am hee that heard and savve these thyngs. And vvhen I had heard and seene, I fel downe to vvorship at the feete of the Angell that shevved these things vnto me. 9. And he saide vntoo me, See thou do it not. For I am a felovvseruant of thyne and of thy brethren the Prophets, and of them that keepe the vvordes of thys booke: VVorship God. The credit & authoritie of this prophesie.And I Iohn am he. G. For asmuch as it is a harder matter to beléeue any prophesie that vttereth thinges to come, than too beléeue a story that reporteth things already done: to the in∣tent all godly folke might perswade themselues the certenly∣er and stedfastlyer that the thinges whiche this propheticall booke conteineth, are faithfull and true: Iohn meant to ex∣presse his proper name, though he suppressed his Sirname. B. Whereby we gather that he was of great name and au∣thoritie, yea and also very renoumed and famous among the Churches of Asia. S. For, that which he sayth héere, is such as this: I your fréend Iohn, whome ye haue bin wont to beléeue in other things also. &c. So also Paule alledgeth hys owne name in a very weightie and necessarie matter, to the intent to make his words to be beléeued, saying: Beholde, I Paule say vnto you, that if you be circumcised, Christ auayleth you nothing. Gal. 5. a. 2. That heard. M. That is to wit, the former sayings conteined in this foresaid Prophesie. And sawe these things. That is to saye, I haue vnderstood the figures contey∣ned
in the same. S. He hath added thys, bycause that when men haue both sene and heard through, their witnesse is wōt to be of the greater credite. A. So the Apostles answered the Counsell of Ierusalem: we cannot but speake the things that we haue heard and séene. Act. 4. d. 20. And when I had hearde and seene, I fell downe. &c. Looke for the exposition of this par∣cell héeretofore. 19. b. 10. And he said vnto me, see thou do it not. M. Iohn had not heard this, except God had spoken by an An∣gell. For we reade not that Christ refused to be worshipped, but rather allowed it. Math. 8. a. 2. & Iohn. 9. g. 38. For I am a felowseruant of thine. Looke Hebr. 1. d. 14. and also the tenth verse of the nintéenth Chapter héeretofore. And of thy brethren the Prophets. S. Héere ye sée opēly how the Angell calleth Iohn a Prophet. VVorship God. S. that is to wit, God only. Wher∣of ye may reade in Deuter. 6. b. 13. and Math. 4. b. 10. B.What wor∣shipping is. Wor∣shipping is a reuerend, seruisable, and obedient bowing of ourselues vnto God as well in body as in mind, in making our sutes and commending our necessities vnto him. A. And this worship cannot be giuen to any creature without excée∣ding great dishonor vnto God. 10. And he saide vnto me, seale not vp the sayings of the prophesie of this booke. S.G.The end for which this prophesie was To the behofe of ye Church were such manner of visions reueled vnto Iohn: of whyche some were to be fulfilled euen then out of hande, and other∣some somewhat laterward. Therefore they were not to bée sealed vp: that is to say they were not to be hidden, but they were to be published abroade, G. that as many as méene too serue God, myght beware of deceiuers. For the time is at hand. A. That is to witte, wherein euery of the promises concer∣ning the day of iudgement and after the iudgement shall bée fulfilled.
11 He that dothe harme, let him doe harme still: and he that is filthie let him be filthie stil: and he that is righ∣tuous, let him be rightuous still, and he that is holy, let him be holie still. He that doth harme, let him do harme stil. P. He sheweth here Gods secrete (how beit iust) iugementes,The secret working of Gods iudge∣mentes. whereby wicked men are suffered to growe woorse and woorse: lyke as con∣trarywise the godlie waxe better and better. And so is Christ a stone too stumble at, and the rising ageyne of manie: L. and the Apostles are to some a good sauour of lyfe vnto lyfe, and vnto other some the sauour of death vnto death. B. And the preaching of the crosse is foolishnesse to them that perishe, but vnto vs that beleue, it is the power of god to saluation. 1. Cor. 1. c. 18. &. Rom. 1. c. 16. Therfore it is all one as if he should say, The truth must be preached: and albéeit that froward per∣sons and naughtipacks be therby prouoked to cōtinue more & more in doing mischief, & although that such as delight them selues from tyme to tyme in the filthinesse of their sins, pro∣cede in defiling themselues with more filthinesse, euen in de∣spyght of it when they be reproued: yet must not the truthe be omitted for such mennes pleasures. For in them that loue rightuousnesse it furthereth the increase of vertue: according as it is sayd by hearing, the wyse man becommeth the wy∣ser. Prouerb. 1. a. 5. But fooles despise wisedome and lerning Prouerb. 1. a. 7. Also, whosoeuer hath, to him shall be giuen, and he shall be made richer: and whosoeuer hath not, from him shall be taken euen that whiche he hathe. Math. 13. b. 12. A. Then cōmeth it to passe by Gods rightfull iudgement, that the vngodly put the children of God to trouble, and that the wickednesse of them is filled vp, whiche despyse Gods word and go away after the lusts of the flesh, shaking of the sweete yoke of Christe, and submitting themselues to the slauerie of Satā. For God is wont sometymes to punish sin with sin: as hath bin sayd alredy, And he that is filthie &c. The wicked
growing always woorse and woorse, doe hoorde vp wrath too themselues ageinst the day of vengeance when Gods right∣full iudgement shall be shewed openly. Rom. 2. a. S. And hee that is rightuous. &c. M. That is to wit, according to the fore∣sayd prophesie, two wayes: namely that the wicked behol∣ding the horrour of their owne filthinesse, might either loth it, and be conuerted, or else be punished the sorer by Gods rightfull iudgement: and contrarywise that the godlie should stoutly withstand vntruth,The faithful haue neede of ye continuance of gods grace. (and as much as is possible) call backe the strayers into the right path of truth. And he that is holy. &c. A. Although the faithfull be clensed by Christs blud, (as hath bin sayde afore. 1. b. 5.) yet notwithstanding, foras∣much as they must haue a continuall battel against the rem∣nants of sinne: they be neuer so well clensed and purifyed in this present lyfe, but that they haue néede to be newe sancti∣fied from time to time. And therefore Peter writeth in this wyse: Déerlybeloued, seeing ye be warned afore hande, be∣ware that you be not ledde away with others into errour of wickednesse, and so fall away from your owne stedfastnesse. But growe ye in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ. 2. Pet. 3. d. 17. 12 And beholde I come shortly, and my hire is vvith mee, too render vntoo euery man accordyng as his vvorke shall be. And behold I come shortly. A. The Angel speaketh againe in the person of Christ, repeting yt which he had spoken afore in the seuenth verse of this present chapter, & that not without cause. For by this inkling of his cōming, he warneth the de∣ceiued sort to amēd betimes, & not to defer their cōuersion frō day to day, as cōmonly is wont to be doon: for the iudge is ne∣rer at hand, than men take him to be. Also this saying cōfor∣teth the deuout worshippers of God, to be of a stout & cōstant minde, euen in the mids of persecution, A. assuring themselues that the daye of their redemption is at hande, euen hards
at their dores.What is ment hyre, wages, or reward. And my hyre is with me. G. Héere Christ she∣weth himselfe to be iudge of the whole world, in asmuch as he auoucheth that he will render euery man his reward. For all this whole booke treateth of the holinesse and righteous∣nesse of the chosen, and likewise of the naughtinesse of the castaways. S. Wherefore it behoueth vs to be héedfull, that euery one of vs do diligently performe his dutie accordyng to his calling. As for the profiting or not profiting of our la∣bour, that must we put to the discretion of him that promi∣seth to yéelde vnto euery man his reward according too hys worke. A. Let vs not sleepe as others do, but let vs watch and be sober. 1. Thessa. 5. b. 6. A. Waiting for the blissed hope and for the appéering of the glory of the great God and of our Sa∣uiour Iesus Christ. Tit. 2. d. 13. S. Moreouer the Hyre whereof mention is made héere, must be referred, not to the desert of the worke, as the meritmongers talke, but to the beléeuing of the promis, according to this text, when ye haue done all that is enioyned you, say ye, we be vnprofitable seruants, we haue done but that which we ought to do.All things are of Gods tree grace. Luke. 17. c. 10. For both the good will, and the good worke, and the holding on in working good, yea and the reward of it too, are all of them gy∣uen to the godly, of Gods frée grace, and not rendered for their owne desert, howbeit that the scripture is wont to allure the litle ones to good works, by promising them reward. Séeyng then that all things befall vs through the grace of the gyuer: nothing is due vnto vs by desert. For vnto him that worketh reward is imputed, not according to grace, but according too duetie. Rom. 4. a. 4. Also, So are the remnāt saued according to the election of Gods grace. But if by grace, then not by works, for thē were grace no longer grace. Rom. 11. a. 5. And again, what hast thou whiche thou hast not receiued? and if thou haue receyued, why boastest thou as though thou hadst not receiued? 1. Cor. 4. b. 7. Then ought we not to glory in a∣ny thing, sith we haue nothing of our owne. Neyther is it our deseruings, but his owne giftes, that God crowneth in vs.
Therefore let not any flesh glory in the sight of God, but let him that glorieth glory in the Lord. Ierem. 9. g. 24. &. 1. Cor. 1. d. 31. And whereas God himselfe promiseth vs wages,Why God promiseth reward. and a∣lureth vs with reward: he thereby prouideth for our weake∣nesse (as I said afore) bycause we be like vnto children, who are allured with fayre promises to procéede in doing wel, and oftentimes also are hild to their dutie by threatnings. A. But as touching the tearme Hyre Looke more in the. 18. verse of the. 11. Chapter héeretofore. And I will render vnto euery man. &c. Looke Math. 16. d. 27. & Rom. 2. a. 6. &. Héeretofore. 2. f. 23. 13. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the first and the last. I Am Alpha and Omega. &c. M.God is the author of this prohesie. Iohn hath repeted this say∣ing now thrée times, in the beginning, in the middes, and in the end of thys booke: to do vs to vnderstād, that al this whole prophesie procéedeth vtterly from God himselfe who is the beginning and end of all things, and so to make vs to reuerēce and receiue it as the very word of God himselfe.Christes Godhead. S. Also thys place giueth an inkling of the euerlasting Godhead in Chiste being man, afore whome there was no God (as the Prophet saith) neyther shall be after him: who is the first enterance of the being, and the end of the last knitting vp of all things. E∣say. 43. b. 11. A. Looke for the rest of the exposition of this place in the eigth verse of the first Chapter héeretofore. 14. Blissed are they that keepe his cōmaundements: that their povver may be in the tree of life, and may en∣ter in at the gates into the Citie. Blissed are they. &c. A.An incorage∣ment to doo well. Christ speaketh to his disciples after thys manner: Take vp my yoke vpon yée, and learne of me, that I am méeke and lowly of hart, and ye shall find rest vnto your soules: for my yoke is swéete, and my burthen is lyght. Math. 11. d. 29. S. His commandements therfore are not heauy, in asmuch as he which biddeth vs, reacheth vs his hād, & giueth
vs his spirit as an incorager and stirrer vp of vs, who ma∣keth the vnwilling man willing, and setteth before our eyes the greatnesse of the good thinges too come, to the intent wee should neglect the present goods which perish, and continually labour for the euerlasting goods: which thing Iohn expresseth in this place, by such words as these: That their power may be. M. That is to say, that they may eate of the trée of lyfe, by in∣ioying the pleasure of euerlasting happinesse. And enter in at the gates. G. That is too wit, by faith, hope, and charitie, and by the doctrine whiche the ministers of Christe doe preache. M. And we haue told you now oftentimes already, that by the name of this Citie, is mente the Churche, or the kingdome of Heauen. 15 But vvithoute shall be dogges and sorcerers, and vvhoremongers, and murtherers, and idolaters, and all suche as loue and make lyes. The title of a christian is vayn without christian lyfe and doctrine.And vvithout shall be. A. Althoughe that in this present lyfe the good be mingled with the bad, so as the Church doth som∣times noorish in hir bosom the deadliest enimies of the truth: yet the time wil come that the one shal be separated from the other, and be cast into vtter darknesse, according as Christe teacheth, Mat. 7. d. 23. &. 13. d. 30. &. 25. c. 32. Wherfore let no mā stand vpon his owne reputation, nor deceiue himselfe vnder pretence that he beareth the name of a Christian: but let eue∣ry man go through with his own vocation lustily, as alwais standing in the presence of God, that he may haue assurance in the day of iudgement, when the sundring of the godly and vngodlie, of the chozen and the castaways, and of the rygh∣tuous and the hypocrites shall be apparant. Dogges. So doth he terme either the flatterers which dare not barke agaynst Antichrist, or the ireful sort which barke ageinst Gods truth, and snappishly bite the seruants of God. Also these be the per∣sons of whō Christ saith, Giue not the thing that is holy, vn∣to Dogs, neither cast your pearles before swine, leaste these
treade thē vnder their féet, & the other sort turne vpon you, & teare you asunder. In which place Christ calleth all such mē, dogges and Swine, not as are vncleane, or without the feare of God, or voyd of true religion: but such as by some euident proofe doe shew a wilfull contempt of God, so as their disease is vncurable. C. And he séemeth to put a difference betwixte SwineSwine. and dogs, attributing vnto swine a beastly blockish∣nesse, and vnto dogs a furious rage. B. For by swine are mēt such as haue wholly plunged themselues in filthy pleasures, and which (asmuch as in them lieth) do blasphemously wroot vp and defile the pure doctrine of the Gospel with their foule groynes. And truly experience teacheth vs that there be two suche sorts of despizers. As for examples sake looke whatsoe∣uer is written in the Scriptures concerning the corruptnesse of mans nature, concerning frée inrightuousing, and concer∣ning Gods eternall election: many turne it eyther to slouth∣fulnesse, or else to wantonnesse of the flesh: and such are apt∣ly and woorthyly déemed to be swyne. Ageyn, othersome teare the pure doctrine & the ministers therof with traitrous slaun∣ders, as though they weakned & infringed the indeuer of wel∣doing, and the feare of God, & al regard of saluation. Therfore although yt by the names of dogs & swine, Christe betokeneth the vncurable aduersaries of Gods worde: yet by likening them to two diuers things, he sheweth vs briefly what diffe∣rence ther is betwéen the one & the other. Also it is to be mar∣ked that he sayth, least they turne or chaunge, & teare you in peeces. For at the first they dissemble, to ye end they may lern the secrets of religion: and when they haue learned them, so∣deinly they change their copie, and make a mocking and flou∣ting at thē, byting and tearing the ministers of Gods worde, and all such as follow the truthe. So did Alexander the Cop∣persmith. 2. Tim. 4. c. 14. So didde Hymencus. 1. Tim. 1. d. 20. So did the Emperoure Iulian the backslyder. So did Por∣phyrie, and Luciane, and so doe the Papistes at this day.Who be sor∣cerers. And Sorcerers. A. These are suche as be giuen to witchcrafte, and
bewitch vnlearned princes with false prophesies and false miracles. A. Of which sort were the Wizards Simon and E∣limas, of whome Luke writeth in the Acts. 8. b. 9. &. 13. a. 6. And VVhoremongers.Who bee whoremon∣gers. That is to say, wedlock breakers or de∣fylers of other mens beddes, whorehunters, defylers of theyr own kin, rauishers of maydens, and suche as vse vnnaturall fornicatiō as the Sodomites did: Of which sorthe ye boasters of the Romish chastitie at this day, euen our wiuelesse clear∣gy, & religious folke, A. who holding skorne of Gods lawes, & despising holy wedlocke, haue giuen ouer themselues to wan∣tonnesse, to commit all kind of vncleanesse, euen with grée∣dinesse. Eph. 4. e. 19. And Murtherers,Murtherers. Chéefly of the Prophets, and of those that find fault with the corrupt manners of the Cleargimen and Monks, exhorting them to honest conuer∣sation. A. So said Christ to the Iewes. Now ye séeke to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth which I haue heard at Gods hand. Iohn. 8. e. 40. Also, Ierusalem, Ierusalem whych sleaeth ye Prophets. &c. Math. 23. d. 37. And Idolaters.Idolaters. M. That is to wit, al such as prefer any thing before ye loue of God. S. And vnder ye name are touched al such as go about to win Gods fauour by a false & deuised Religion not appointed by God. Of ich sort were in old time the worshipping in high pla∣ces, the worshipping of the brazen serpent, and the ofspring of mens children in Sacrifice: and in these dais the horrible and trayterous abhomination of the Masse, the worshipping of Images and Saincts, Pilgrimages to the Citie of Rome, to Sainct Iames and to other places for the obteyning of par∣dons or rather of paltries, and a thousand such other thinges. The cause of whiche enormities Paule rendereth in these words: Therfore God gaue them one. to ye lusts of their own hartes, to all vncleannesse, to defyle their owne bodyes be∣twéene themselues, bycause they turned his truth into a lye, and worshipped and serued the creatures more than the ma∣ker which is blissed for euer. Rom. 1. e. 24.25. They knew the one God and his benefytes in his creatures, and they ought to
haue worshipped him only. But they turned themselues too Idolls and misworshippings. A.M.B.R. For they bereft stones,What it is to turne truth into falsehod. timber, and metals of that whiche they were, and made them that which they were not: and that was to turne truth into falshod. For the representing of God which men pretend by imagerie, is but a fond deuise and merelye of their owne ma∣king, and specially wheras they father any power vppon it. B. For there can no honour be giuen to any creature in way of Religion, but it must be taken away and abridged from God. BV. And yet euen in these dayes a man may sée in the Churches of the Papists, not only Saincts to be worshipped, but also more worship to be done vnto them, than vnto God. Looke more in the tenth verse of the nintéenth Chapter héer∣tofore, and in the. 13. verse of the. 14. Chapter heeretofore.Who beliers. And all such as loue. &c. Of which rable be all Hipocrites preten∣ding outwardly a holinesse of life, and all such as mainteyne counterfet Religion by misinterpreting of the scriptures and by lying miracles, and furthermore all suche as charge the ministers of Gods word with misreports of crimes, too ye in∣tent to deface their authoritie in teaching, and to make theyr sermons suspected of vntruth as vnworthy to be beleeued, too the end that they themselues may procéede in ye meane while in their pride, gathering of goodes, and riot. A. Also within the same compasse are comprehended al backbiters & enimies of other mennes good names,To loue lying or vntruth. and whosoeuer else despiseth the truth and goeth forward in lying. And therefore the worde Loue carieth a force with it. For to loue lyes is more than simply to make a lye. A. And Saincte Paule seemeth to haue comprised this verse of Sainct Iohns in one other verse, where he writeth thus to the Corinthians: Know yee not that the vnrighteous shall not inherit the kingdome of God? Bee not beguiled. Neyther whoremongers, nor worshippers of Images, nor wedlockbreakers, nor Weakelings, nor abu∣sers of the malekind, nor theeues, nor couetous persons, nor drunkards, nor raylers, nor extorcioners shall inherit the
kingdome of God. 1. Cor. 6. b. 9. And again, For this ye know, that no whoremonger, or vncleane persone, or couetous per∣sone, who also is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdome of Christ and of God. Ephes. 5. b. 5. For looke what Iohn calleth to bee without, that dothe Paule call to bée berefte of the inheritaunce of Goddes children: that is to saye, too bée set besyde euerlasting lyfe whiche is prepa∣red for none but the beléeuers, from the beginning of the world. 16 I Iesus haue sent mine Angel to vvitnesse these thynges vnto you in the Churches. I am the roote andSome read Head spring. ofspring of Dauid, and the bright morning Starre. Another assu∣rance of ye cre∣dit & authori∣tie of this pro¦phesie.I Iesus. This is another assurance to the intent the Chri∣sten héerers may giue the better mind and credit to this pro∣phesie. A. For Iesus not only is a faithfull and soothfast wit∣nesse, but also the very truth itselfe, who cannot alledge any thing but that which is most certain and most true. Haue sent myne Angell.Christ excellē∣ter than the Angelles. Then is Christe excellenter than the Angells, and farre worthier than they, séeing he may sende them a∣broade at his pleasure. Concerning whiche matter looke. Ephes. 1. d. 21. and Phil. 2. b. 9.10.11. & Hebr. 1. b. 5. To witnesse. By the word witnesse he betokeneth that the matter is ear∣nest which is treated  héere, least any man might rashly de∣spise this prophesie. In the Churches. M. Not onely in corners and priuye places, but also in the solemne congregation of the faithfull,Christ is the roote and of∣spring of Da∣uid. for whose profit tis prophesie is written. I am the roote and ofspring. Namely in whome and by whome all maner of promises are fulfilled. Moreouer, Christ is Dauids roote in respect that he is the word: and he is Dauids ofspring in respect of the manhood which he hath taken vpon him. Sée Rom. 1. a. 3. &. 9. a. 5. And the bright morningstar. So is Chryste our Lorde called, bycause hée driueth away the nyght of
darkenesse and of all errours, and bringeth the day of grace and soule health. 17. And the Spirit and the Bryde say, Come. And let him that heereth say also, Come. And let him that is a thirste come, and vvhosoeuer listeth, let him take the vvater of life, freely. And the Spirit and the bryde say.The Church longeth for Christs com∣ming vnto Iudgment. The Spirit in the chozen prayeth to bée imbraced in the armes of the brydegrome. In lyke wise also the bryde prayeth continually in spirite. For héere is treated of the imbracings of Christ the brydegrome and of his bryde, like as in Salomons ballads. 4. d. 6. Come. G. Namely vntoo iudgement ageinst all the Reprobates, that when all thine enemies bée ouerthrowen, the glorie of thy Maiestie maye bée perfectly séene, and all the faythfull bée thorowly knit vntoo thée, whom thou hast hitherto guided by thy Spirite. And let him that heereth say, Come. S. That is too say, he that beléeueth in his harte that this prophesie shall bée fulfilled by Christ, let hym pray too God hartily too hastē hys comming, that the chozen maye bée set at libertie, and inioy the imbracings whyche they haue longed for. And let him that is a thirst come. A. He hath an eye too that whiche he hath spoken alreadie, saying: Vntoo hym that is a thirste I wyll gyue of the fountayne of lyuing water fréely. Héere∣tofore. 21. b. 6. And in another place Chryste saythe: If any man bée a thirst, let him come vntoo me and drinke. &c. Iohn. 7. f. 37. And whosoeuer listeth, let him take water of lyfe. P.How man may lyst. Howe can he say, whosoeuer listeth, séeing that Christ sayth in ano∣ther place, no man commeth vntoo mée excepte my father which sent mée, doo drawe hym. Iohn. 6. e. 44. A. And Paule sayth, It is neyther of mans wyll nor of his running, but of God which pitieth him. Rom. 9. d. 16. I answer: Iohn spea∣keth so, not bycause it lyeth in mans choyce too come of hys owne swindge, and too drawe of the water of lyfe when he listeth: but bycause that euen he whyche allureth men too
the waters of lyfe, dooth also gyue vs the desyrousnesse of thirsting, and put intoo vs both the will and the strength too come: or rather, of vnwilling makes vs willing, too the in∣tent that all glorie may redounde vntoo hym, and not rest in vs. S. For it is well ynough knowen howe the Apostle sayth, Wee haue such maner of trust too Godward through Christ: not that wée bée able too thinke any thing of oure selues as of our selues: but if wée bée able to doo any thing, the same is of God. 2. Cor. 3. a. 4. And ageine, God is he that worketh in you both the wyll and the accomplishing of the will, accordyng too his owne good pleasure, Phil. 2. b. 13. Therefore too the in∣tent too commend vntoo vs the grace of God, without which wée can doo no good at all:Men cannot prepare them∣selues to God∣ward. he addeth forthwyth, Freely, A. too the ende wée may knowe howe it is in vayne for men too bragge of their owne preparations or merites, séeing that al the goodnesse which is bestowed vppon vs, procéedeth of the frée fauour of God. For who hath giuen vntoo him first, and he shall bée payed it ageyne? Rom. 11. d. 35. Also, wée loue him bycause he hathe loued vs first. 1. Iohn. 4. d. 19. P. Then haue wee receyued the will too come, fréely of God, at whose hand wée haue not earned too bée, by bestowing anye thing vpon him first, and howe muche lesse then can wée deserue too bée made rightuous, of sinners. 18. For I protest vntoo all suche as heere the vvords of the prophesie of this booke, If any man shall adde vntoo these things, God shal lay vpon him the plagues that are vvritten in this booke. The punish∣ment of the falsifyers of ye Scripture.I protest vntoo all such as heere. &c. G.S. This protestation is made ageinst the falsifyers of the Scripture, of whome the nūber was to great in the time of the Apostles, as it is to be seene in Luke. 1. a. 1. And therefore when Paule wrate to the Thessalonians, he added this of purpose. The Salutation of mee Paule wyth mine owne hand: which is my signet in al my Epistles. Thus wryte I, the grace of our Lorde Iesus
Christ bée wyth you all. Amen. 2. Thess. 3. d. 17. And a little a∣fore, he had written thus: bée not hastily remoued from your mynd, nor troubled, neither by spirit, nor by worde, nor by letter as from vs, as though the day of the Lord were at hand. 2. Thess. 2. a. 2. And Eusebius in the .xx. Chapter of his fifth booke of Churchmatters affirmeth that Ireneus By∣shop of the Churche of Lyons, made almost a lyke protesta∣tion in his booke of Eyghtes. The wordes of the Prophesie of this booke. A. Once ageyn he aduanceth this wryting with the ty∣tle of prophesie, least any man myghte thinke that the same may bee despised without dishonor to the spirit of prophesie. If any man shall adde vntoo these things. The effect is, that men must neyther put any thing too, nor take any thing awaye from the Scripture: according as it is said in another place, All the sayings of God are as it were clenzed with fyre, they are a shéelde too them that trust in them. Put not any thing too the words therof, least he perchaunce do reproue thee & thou be founde a lyer. Prouerb. 30. a. 5. G.Who do adde to ye scripture. They be sayde too adde too the Scripture, which counterfeyt it and mar it, and make a cloke of it, for their leasings and errours: of whiche sort be the Heretikes and deceyuers. God shall lay vpon hym the plagues. &c. It is a sore and earnest threatning: as if it were sayd, he that dareth doo this, shall bée giuen vp to a wic∣ked mynde, till at length he consume and come too naught. For too thys ende doo all the plagues tende which are speci∣fyed in this booke: according as the readers may easely per∣ceyue. 19. And if any man shall minishe the vvordes of the booke of this prophesie, God shall take avvay his parte out of the booke of life, and out of the holy Citie, and out of the things that be vvritten in this booke. And if any man shall minishe. G. Those diminishe the Scrip∣ture which deface the authoritie of if,Who they be that diminish ye scripture. or which suppresse any péece of it maliciously, bycause they are loth to displease men.
This do certeine flattering and suttleheaded preachers: who holding scorne of the purenesse and simplicitie of Gods word, forge certeine new termes out of the works house of mannes wisedome, by meanes whereof there rise exceeding great troules diuers times in the Church of Chryst Such mner of Church plagues doth Iohn make afrayd with thse words, God shall take away his part.Their punish∣ment. &c. That is to say, he shall not bée mustred among the chosen Citizens of the citie that is aboue, neither shall he bee an heire of the heauenly kingdom, which is prepared for none but suche as haue their names written in the booke of lyfe. Wherof I haue spoken more in the third chapter and fyfth verse, and. 9. a. 4. and. 13. b. 8. and. 17. b. 8. and 20.12. heretofore. 20. He that beareth vvitnesse of these things, sayth: yea, I come apace. Amen, Yea, come Lord Iesu. Christ will shortly reuēge his elect.He that beareth witnesse of these things sayth. S. Iohn brin∣geth in the Lorde Iesus (who beareth witnesse of the things that are written héere) as one subscribing and ratifying hys prayer, in saying, Yea, or So bée it. I come apace. That is too wit, too deliuer the godly from the slaunders of the wicked, and to render vntoo all the vngodly the punishment of their treacherie. Amen. This is the saying of a man that wisheth and ratifyeth a thing, according as wée haue séene dyuerse times. Yea, Come Lord Iesu. Iohn in the name of himselfe and of all the godly,The godly wish for the speedy cōming of Christ. wisheth for the comming of our Lorde Iesus. A. q. d. Nothing is more pleasant or more desired on our part thā thy comming, by the gloriousnesse & power wherof, that sonne of perdition shall bee destroyed, whiche presumeth so proudly too vsurpe thy kingdome. 21. The grace of our Lord Iesu Christ be vvith you all. Amen. Of salutation or gréetings.The grace of our. &c. M. It is a kynd of Salutation and sub∣scription that Paule vseth euery where of ordinarie: as in
Rom. 16. d. 20.24. &. 2. Thess. 3. d. 17. Yet doth not this disallow or condemne all other formes of greeting or taking leaue: but euery tung hath his peculiar manner of spéeche, wherevntoo there is no exception too bée taken thoughe they differ from this in wordes, so the wordes bee godly and Christian.The conclu∣sion of thys worke with an exhortatiō. Now remaineth it that wée also shoulde wishe for the comming of our lord Iesus Christ as Iohn doth, to ye intent he may pluck vp all heresies, destroy Antichristes, throw downe Antichrist himselfe, disappoynt the practizes of him and his, builde vp the doctrine of the Gospell in the heartes of the Christians, and neuer cease too plant, cherish and multiply the defenders and preachers thereof continually from day to day: so as all men from the most too the least maye apply their mindes to the reforming of Christes Churche, and too the confounding and destroying of Antichrist & his fauorers. Which thing wée beséeche him only to graunt, who is alwayes woont too confounde the strong things of the worlde by the weake things. 1. Corin. 1. d. 27. Vntoo him bée glo∣rie and souereintie for euer and euer. So bée it. Amen. Amen. Amen. FINIS. ¶ Imprinted at London by Henrie Binneman, for Lucas Harison, and George Byshop. Anno. 1574.
