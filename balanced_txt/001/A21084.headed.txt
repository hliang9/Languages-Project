THE PETITION AND REMONSTRANCE OF THE GOVERNOR And Company of Merchants of LONDON, Trading to the East Indies, Exhibited to the Honorable the House of COMMONS assembled in PARLIAMENT. Anno 1628. blazon or coat of arms Printed at LONDON for NICHOLAS BOVRNE. 1628.
TO THE HONORABLE THE HOVSE OF COMMONS assembled in PARLIAMENT. The humble Petition of the Gouernor and Company of Merchants of London Trading to the East Indies. Humbly shewing; THat whereas by the speciall in∣dustry and great Charges of divers Merchants of London and others of his Maiesties Subiects, the Trade to the East Indies was begunne now twentie eight yeares past, and hath beene ever since conti∣nued by a Company of all degrees of persons in this Kingdome, incorporated vn∣der the royall Charters of the late Queene Elizabeth and King Iames of blessed memory: which haue beene since ratified and confirmed by the Kings most excel∣lent Maiesty that now is, with such priviledges and im∣munities, as are therein at large conteined; whereby many and sundry Voyages haue beene performed into those remote Countries with good successe and great gaine, vntill of late yeares some evill Encounters, not
onely of the Seas and enemies, but more especially the vndue proceedings and actions of our professed friends and Allies, haue infinitely damnified the said Traffique, which otherwise might haue prospered and growne much better: even as it is by time and industrie greatly inlarged and discovered for a more ample Vent and Consumption of our Cloath, and other our natiue Commodities; Neverthelesse, the afore-written dis∣asters, and the carring of forreigne Coines out of this Kingdome into the Indies, haue begot such causelesse Complaints in the mouths of many his Maiesties Sub∣iects of all degrees and in all places of the Realme, that the Adventurers are thereby much discouraged to Trade any longer vnder the evill censure of the multi∣tude, desiring nothing more then to obteine their pri∣vate wealth, with the publique good, Therefore the petitioners humbly pray this Honora∣ble House to take the annexed Articles (or any o∣thers) into your most graue & wise consideration, that so if vpon the due examination of the same, the said trade be found vnprofitable to the Com∣mon-wealth, it may be SVPPRESSED. And if otherwise, that then it may be SVPPOR∣TED AND COVNTENANCED BY SOME PVBLIQVE DECLARATI∣ON for the satisfaction of all his Maiesties Sub∣iects, and better encouragement of the present Adventurers, or any others, who thereby might be the more forward and willing to adventure their Estates in a businesse of such consequence, when they shall know that it hath obteined such great and honorable approbation.
Queres vpon the Trade to the East Indies. Strength WHether it doth not much increase the strength of this Kingdome with Marri∣ners, Warlike-Shipping, Ammunition, and all necessarie Arts-men thereunto belonging. Whether it doth not greatly increase the generall traffique of this Kingdome, not onely as it is a very ample trade of it selfe, betweene England and the Indies, but also as it is an ample Staple or Maga∣zine of many rich Indian wares, to send from hence into other forreigne Countries. Wealth Whether it doth not increase the generall Stocke and wealth of the Kingdome. Whether it be not a meanes to saue the particular Subjects much money yearly in their ordinarie ex∣pences vpon all the sorts of Indian wares. Whether it doth not much increase his Majesties Customes and Imposts in the yearely revenue. Whether it be not a good meanes to improue the price of Lands, Woolls, Tynn, Iron, Lead, and other the Natiue commodities of this Kingdome.
Whether the King and the Kingdome (also) haue not gotten much by this Trade even in these late disa∣sterous times, when the Ad-venturers haue lost great matters. Safetie Whether it be not a meanes greatly to weaken the KING of SPAINE and his Subjects, and to exhaust their Treasure. Whether it be not a meanes to counterpoize the HOLLANDERS swelling greatnes by trade, and to keepe them from being absolute Lords of the Seas, if they may driue vs out of this rich tra∣ffique, as they haue long endeavoured to performe both by pollicie and force. Treasure Whether it be not the best meanes wee haue to in∣crease the Treasure or Money of this Kingdome. Honour Whether it be not an honour sutable to the Maje∣stie of so great a King and Kingdome.
THE HVMBLE REMONSTRANCE OF THOSE REASONS which the Gouernour and Company of Merchants of London trading to the East India doe make vpon the Queres that are annex∣ed vnto their Petition, exhibited vnto the Honourable House of COMMONS assembled in PARLIAMENT. And First;Whether it doth not much encrease the strength of the Kingdom with Mar∣riners, Warlike Shipping, Amunition and all necessary Arts-men there vn∣to belonging.Strength Whether it doth not greatly encrease the generall Traffique of the King∣dome, not onely as it is a very ample
Trade of it selfe betweene England and the Indies; but also as it is an ample Staple or Magazine of many rich Indian wares to send from hence into other forraigne Countries. THE Trade to the East Indies some few yeares past did imploy fifteene thousand tunns of Shipping all at once, either going or comming, or Trading there from Port to Port; but since (vpon good experience) wee finde that so great a Charge is neither necessarie for our defence; nor comportable by the benefit of the Traffique, vntill some further Discoueries may be made in China, or else-where, as is hoped: Neuer∣thelesse (according to the present times) there is and may be imployed and maintained tenn thou∣sand tunns of great and warlike Shipping, besides three thousand tunns more now here in the King∣dome repayring for the next Supply of those Voya∣ges. THe said Shipping doe imploy two thousand and fiue hundred Marriners, wherof one third part at least are shipped from hence Land-men, or such as were not formerly vsed to the Seas, but are bred and made good Marriners by these Voyages, which o∣therwise at home (being without Arts or mainte∣nance) are a heauie burthen to their friends and Country.
THis Trade as it is thus great in it selfe; so doth it yet further enlarge our Traffique and strength, by furnishing this Kingdome with all sorts of Indian wares, not onely for our owne vse, but more especially for the necessa∣ry wants of forraigne Nations, which hath greatly encreased the number of our Warlike Shippes, to ex∣port them from hence into Turky, Italy, the East Coun∣tries, and other places: For proofe whereof wee in∣stance the last yeare when wee brought in Pepper from the Indies to the value of two hundred and eight thousand pounds sterling, whereof one hundred and fourescore thousand pounds was within few weekes after Shipped, or sould to be transported into for∣raigne Countries: the like is done with Indico, either in the same kinde it is brought in, or else after wee haue gotten the benefit of the manufacture in the dye of our Clothes, and so likewise of Callicoes and divers other rich Wares; in so much that wee may boldly affirme, that by these exportations as from a Staple Magazine of Indian Commodities for divers parts of Christendome and Turky, wee doe imploy going and comming in those Voyages at least two thou∣sand tunns of Shipping, which doe require fiue hun∣dred Marriners to man them. THe Arts and handicrafts-men, which appertaine vnto the building and repayring of all the said Shipping, together with the making of Ordnance, Muskets, Shott, Powder, Swords, Pikes, Cordage, Canvas, & many other necessary Ammunitions and provisions thereunto belonging, made here in the
Kingdome, doth not imploy lesse then one thousand men of diuers trades. SO that the whole strength by this Trade to the East Indies,The whole strength by the East India Trade. is the continuall imployment of twelue thousand tunns of Warlike Shipping, and foure thousand Marriners and Arts-men more then in the times before this Trade begun, which is a great addi∣tion of power to the Kingdome. BVt if any man obiect and say,Answere to divers Ob∣jections. that heretofore wee imployed three or foure hundred tunns of Ship∣ping yearely into Turkey, to lade Spice and Indico, which Trade is now vtterly lost, because those Com∣modities are now brought vs directly from the In∣dies; the answere is, that in the times when we were serued with the said Wares from Turkey, the impor∣tation was but small, because the prizes then were deare; so that wee may well counterpoize the losse of that imployment of Shipping with as much or more tunnage now set on worke to fetch Timber, Plancke, Pipe-Staues, and Timber knees out of Ire∣land, and Hempe out of East land to make our Cor∣dage for the furnishing of so many great Shippes as wee now imploy to the Indies, and also for the bringing in of Wines, Elephants teeth, wrought Silkes, Corrall, Quicke-Siluer, and other forraigne Wares, to furnish out those Voyages. ANd if it be further objected, that this great en∣crease of Shipping which is here declared, is not alwayes in the Kingdome vpon occasion of service,
the answere is. That neither are the Shippes of any other Marchants heere at home, but some are go∣ing, some are comming, and euer the least part are in the Kingdome; yet still wheresoeuer they are, his Maiesties Subiects haue by them their imploy∣ment and maintenance, and the Kingdome aswell as the East India Company haue had their service: For how famous are their exploits to all Nations? how many rich Carracks haue they suncke and spoyled? how many assaults of Spanish Gallions haue they withstood and foyled? What slaughter of their Souldiers, sacke of their Townes, subversion of their trades, and such like honorable actions haue they performed? and all with little losse of Shippes or men. It would require a large discourse, to declare the particulars: Neither doth the East India Company commonly want three thousand Tunns of shipping or more heere in the Kingdome, which are either in building or repayring, toge∣ther with all their Ordnance and other Warlike furniture, besides their Store-houses and Dock∣yards plentifully provided with Timber, Plancke, Cordage, Powder, Shot, and many other necessary Ammunitions both for themselues, and oftentimes to helpe others with such provisions as cannot else∣where be found for money in this Kingdome, espe∣cially Gun-powder, whereof they haue a good quan∣titie now in store, and doe make weekely about thirtie barrels at their owne powder Mills, of such refined Salt Peeter, as they bring from the Indies in their shipping.
THere is yet one common Objection, but it is so weake that it scarse deserues an answere, which is, that this East India Trade destroyes our Shipping and Marriners, when cleane contrary to this wee haue alreadie shewed the great encrease of both; and if men dye in these long voyages, and Ships by length of time be laid vp, either here or in the Indies, yet what's all this but natures course; and that which happens here at home in our neerest Trades, although with farre lesse noise and notice? How many braue Commanders haue wee bred from meane degree? (whereof diuers are still in our service,) some at this present are found worthie the best places in his Maiesties Navie, many of our or∣dinarie men haue lately lost their liues for their coun∣try, and others (being growne rich) doe either keepe at home or follow shorter voyages, but lea∣ving these advantages wee doe answere all with this, that whatsoeuer is pretended in the decay of ship∣ping or death of men, yet not withstanding the Kingdome, by this trade hath obteyned no lesse in∣crease or cleare addition both of the one and the other, which continually subsist and are in action, then is before declared. Whether it doth not increase the gene∣rall stocke and wealth of the King∣dome. Whether it be not a meanes to saue the
particular Subiects much money yearely in their ordinary expences vpon all sorts of Indian wares. Whether it doth not much increase his Maiesties Customs and Imposts in the yearely revenue. Whether it be not a good meanes to im∣proue the price of Lands, Woolls, Tynn, Iron, Lead,Wealth and other the natiue commodities of this King∣dome. Whether the King and the King∣dome (also) haue not gotten much by this Trade, euen in these late disasterous times, when the Ad∣venturers haue lost great matters. HEre wee haue fiue Queres which must be all proved severally, the first is generall, where∣in wee must consider how the whole King∣dome may be inriched by our Commerce with Strangers, the which to performe, although it hath one and the same rule in all the particular places
of the Trade;The places of our remotest traffique are most profita∣ble to the Common-wealth. yet is not euery Country alike profi∣table to this Common-wealth, For the remotest traffique is alwayes most beneficiall to the publique Stocke, the example may be framed thus. Suppose wee therefore, that Pepper were constantly worth two shillings the pound here in England, if we should then fetch the same from Holland the Merchant may pay there to the Stranger twentie pence the pound out of this Kingdomes Stocke, and gaine well by the bargaine, but if he fetch this Pepper from the East Indies, he cannot giue there aboue fiue pence the pound at the most to obtaine the like gaine, when all charges are considered; which doth sufficiently shew the great advantage we haue to buy our Wares in those remote Countries, not onely for that part alone which wee spend and consume, but especial∣ly for that great quantitie which from hence wee transport yearely into other Countries to be sould at higher price then it is worth here in England; Whereby it is plaine,We may grow rich in Trade by the Stocke of other Na∣tions. that wee make a farre greater Stocke by gaine vpon these Indian Commodities, then those Nations doe where they grow; and to whom they properly appertaine, as being the na∣turall wealth of their Countries: Neither is there lesse honor and iudgement by getting riches in this manner, vpon the Stocke of other Nations, then by an industrious encrease of our owne meanes, e∣specially when this latter is advanced by the benefit of the former,Cloth, Lead, and Tynn, vented in the East Indies. as wee haue found in the East Indies by sale of much of our Tynn, Cloth, Lead, and other natiue Commodities, the vent whereof doth daily
encrease in those Countries, which formerly had no vse of our Wares, but for the better vnderstanding of that which hath beene said,A distinction betweene the gaine of the Kingdome, and the profit of the Mer∣chant. wee must not forget to distinguish betweene the gaine of the Kingdome and the profit of the Merchant. For although the Kingdome pay no more for this Pepper then is be∣fore supposed, nor for any other Commoditie bought in forraigne parts, more then the Stranger receiueth from vs for the same; Yet the Merchant payeth not onely that price, but also the fraight, ensurance, interest, Custome, impost, and many o∣ther charges which are exceeding great in these long Voyages; but yet all these in the Kingdomes account are but commutations among ourselues, and no priua∣tion of the publique Stocke, they remaine still in the Kingdome. NOw concerning that which euery particu∣lar Subiect of the Realme saveth in his or∣dinary expence of Indian Wares, it is ma∣nifest that heretofore when wee brought Indico from Turkey, that sort was ordinarily sold here for six shillings the pound or more, which now wee fell for foure shillings the pound and vnder, Pepper then ordinarily at three shillings and three shillings foure pence the pound,The Hollanders ingrosing of Cloues, Ma∣ces, and Nut∣megs, haue made them exceeding deare. which now is sould by the East India Company for twentie pence the pound, with long time also given therewith for payment, and so likewise of divers other Wares: But for Cloues it is true; they are now worth eleaven shillings the pound, Maces in sorts tenn shillings, Nutmeges fiue
shillings, because the Hollanders by the expulsion of our people, haue now three yeares past, and still doe keepe vs by force from the trade of those Spi∣ces: In which Wares when we enioyed the free∣dome in the Indies that vnto vs belongeth, Wee sould Cloues here at fiue shillings six pence, Maces at six shillings, Nutmegs at two shillings six pence the pound: But as the Dutch haue raised the price of these Commodities, so would they much more inhaunce them and all other the rich Wares of those Countries, if wee should abandon or be basely dri∣ven from the trade. THe next Quere needs but little proofe, for who can truely say that his Majesties Customes and Impost are not multiply∣ed, when the traffique of this Kingdome is so much encreased, onely this wee will affirme, that if the trade to the East Indies were so well en∣couraged that it might be effectually followed, it would yearely bring to his Majesties Coffers much more then now it doth. THe next Quere concernes the Kingdome neerely, for it is no small worth to im∣proue the price of Lands, which never hath nor can be done, but by the prosperous successe of our forraigne trade,The ballance of our for∣raigne trade is the true rule of our trea∣sure. the ballance whereof is the onely meanes and rule of our treasure: that is to say, When either by issuing out of the Realme
yearely a greater value in Wares then wee consume of forraigne Commodities wee growe rich, or by spending more of Strangers goods then wee sell them of our owne, wee are impouerished; For, the first of these Courses doth bring in the money which wee haue, the last will carry it away againe when wee haue gott it. It is a true saying, that plentie or scarsitie of money makes all things deare or cheape in a Common-wealth, but it is necessary to distinguish the seeming plenties of money from that which onely is substantiall and able to performe the worke; For there are divers wayes and meanes to procure plentie of money into a Kingdome, (for a short time) which doe not therefore inrich, but rather impoverish the same, by the severall in∣conveniencies which ever accompany such altera∣tions. FOr first, if we should melt downe our Plate into Coyne, (which sutes not with the Maiestie of so great a Kingdome, except in cases of great extre∣mitie,) it would cause plenty of money for a time, yet should we be nothing the richer, but rather this Treasure being thus altered, is made the more apter to be carryed out of the Kingdome, if wee exceede our meanes by excesse in forreigne wares, or main∣taine a Warre by Sea or Land, where wee doe not feede and cloath the Souldier, and supply the armies with our owne natiue provisions; by which disor∣ders our Treasure will soone be exhausted, for it is
not the Marchants exchange by bills that can pre∣vent the last of these euills, as some haue suppo∣sed. Againe if wee thinke to bring in store of mo∣ney by suffering forreigne Coynes to passe currant heere at higher rates then their intrinsick value, compared with our standard; or by debasing, or by inhaunsing our owne monies (as some men haue proiected) all these actions bring their severall in∣conveniences, and notable ruines, as well to the King, as to his Subiects; of which wee omit to enlarge, (because it is not much pertinent to our cause in hand) but rather admitting that by these courses, plenty of money might be brought into the Realme, yet should we be nothing the richer, neither can such treasure (so gotten) long remaine With vs,Treasure which cannot long remaine with vs. for, whether it be the Stranger or the English Mar∣chant that brings in this money, it must ever be done vpon a valueable consideration, either for wares carried out alreadie, or after to be exported, which helpes vs nothing except the evill occasions of ex∣cesse or Warre aforenamed be removed, which will exhaust our treasure; for otherwise, the money that one man bringeth in for gaine, an other man shall be forced to carry out for necessitie, because there shall euer be a necessitie to ballance our account with Stran∣gers, although it should be done with great losse vp∣on the rate of the money which is exported, and perill or confiscations also, if it be intercepted by the Law, for necessitie or gaine will ever finde some meanes to violate such Lawes.
THe businesse then is briefly thus, that as the trea∣sure which is brought into the Realme by the ballance of our forreigne trade,Treasure that doth remaine with vs inrich vs, and doth improue our Lands. is that money which onely doth abide with vs, and by which we are inriched, so by this plentie of money thus gotten (and no o∣therwise) doe our lands improue, for when the Mar∣chant hath a good dispatch beyond the Seas, for his Cloath, and other our natiue wares, he doth pre∣sently returne to buy vp the greater quantitie which raiseth the price of Woolls, and other commodi∣ties, which doth improue the Land-lords rents, as the Leases expire dayly; and also by this meanes money being gayned and brought more aboundant∣ly into this Kingdome, it doth inable many men to buy Lands which must make them the dearer: but if our forreigne Trade come to a stop or declination by neglect at home or iniuries abroad, whereby the Mar∣chants are impoverished, and so the Wares of the Realme lesse issued, then doe all the sayd benefits cease, and our Lands fall of price dayly: where∣vpon we conclude, that as the florishing estate of our generall Trade is the onely meanes to make our Lands improue, so the particular Trade to the East Indies, is a Principall instrument therein, because (as we haue already proved,) it hath so much increased the traffique of this Kingdome.
THe next Quere seemes to be a mysterie, which many of our Adventurers doe not well vnderstand, for (say they) how can the Kingdome gaine by this Trade, when wee who are the members thereof, haue lost so grievously? they doe not well discerne that their private losse may be farre lesse in proportion, then the publique benefit, as we shall instance some examples to make the busines plaine. IN the course of forreigne Trade,Three degrees of gaine in for∣raigne Trade. there be three sorts or degrees of gaine, the first is, that of the Com∣mon Wealth, which may be done when the Mar∣chant (who is principall agent therein) shall loose. The second is the gaine of the Marchant, which he doth sometimes iustly and worthily effect, al∣though the Common Wealth be a looser. The third is the gaine of the King, whereof he is euer certaine even when the Common Wealth and the Marchant shall be both loosers. COncerning the first of these, wee haue alreadie sufficiently shewed the waies and meanes where∣by the Common Wealth may be inriched in the course of Trade, by the ballance of the same, when excesses are avoyded: therefore it is needelesse here to make any further repetition; onely wee doe in this place affirme that such happinesse may be in the Common Wealth, when the Marchant for his
particular shall haue no occasion to reioyce. As for example; suppose the East India Company should send out one hundred thousand pounds in Waes or Money into the East Indies, and receiue home for the same, the full value of three hundred thou∣sand pounds, hereby it is evident that this part of the Publique Stocke is trebled, and yet we may bold∣ly say, that which we can well proue, that our sayd Company of Marchants shall be loosers by such an adventure, if the returnes be made in Spice, Indico, Callicoes, Beniamin, refined Salt Peeter, Cotton-yarne, and such other bulkey wares in their severall pro∣portions, according to their vent and vse in these parts of Europe: for the fraight of shipping, the in∣surance of the Adventure, the charges of Factors abroad, and Officers at home, the forbearance of the Stocke, his Maiesties custome and imposts, with other pettie charges incident, will bee aboue two hundred thousand pounds, which being added to the principall produceth losse,The King and Kingdome may get by Trade euen vvhen the Marchant looseth. and thus wee see that not onely the Kingdome, but also the KING may get very much, even when the Marchant not∣withstanding shall loose in his proportion, which giveth good occasion here to consider how much more the Realme is inriched by this Trade, when all things passe so happily that the Marchant is a gayner also together with the KING and King∣dome.
BVt for the better explayning of that which hath beene alreadie alledged, wee must vnderstand that if the said hundred thousand pounds should be trebled by the returne of so much Silkes and o∣ther fine Wares out of the Indies, then the Mar∣chant likewise should receiue good gaine by such an adventure; and the reason is, because this great wealth would require but fiue hundred tunn of Shipping to lade and bring home the same, which is but a very small charge in respect of foure thousand and fiue hundred tunnes of Shipping, which would be required to lade home the like va∣lue in the bulky Commodities of Spice and the like, which are afore-written. THe second sort of gaine in the course of trade is, when the Marchant by his laudable endea∣vours may both bring in and carry out Wares to his advantage, by buying them and selling them to good profit, which is the end of his labours: Yet neverthelesse, the Common-wealth shall de∣cline and growe poore by a disorder in the people, when through pride and other excesses they doe consume more forraigne Ware in value, then the Wealth of the Kingdome can satisfie and pay by the exportation of our owne Commodities, which is the very qualitie of an vnthrift, who spends beyond his meanes.
THe third sort of gaine is the Kings, who is ever sure to get by Trade, when both the Common-Wealth and the Merchant shall loose severally, as a∣fore-written; or ioyntly, as it may and doth some∣times happen when the Merchants successe is bad, and when our Commodities are over-ballanced by forraigne Wares consumed: but if such disorders be not prevented, his Majestie in the end shall be the greatest looser, when his Subiects be impove∣rished. Whether it be not a meanes greatly to weaken the King of Spaine and his Subiects, and to exhaust their trea∣sure. Whether it be not a meanes to counter∣poiz the Hollanders swelling great∣nes by trade,Safetie and to keepe them from being absolute Lords of the Seas, if they may driue vs out of this rich Traffique, as they haue long ende∣voured to performe both by policie and force.
THe safetie of the Kingdome consists not onely in i'ts owne strength and wealth, but also in the laudable and lawfull per∣formance of those things which will weaken and impoverish such powerfull Princes, as either may or are become our Enemies; amongst which wee will now ranke the Spaniard in the first place, for his ambition hath no bounds, and being enabled by the power of his Indian Treasure, not onely to keepe in subiection many goodly States and Provinces in Italy, the Low Countries, and else∣where, (which otherwise would soone fall from his obeysance) but also by a continuall Warre ta∣king his advantages, doth still enlarge his Domi∣nions, ayming at nothing more then Monarchy by this plentie of his money, which are the very syn∣newes of his strength, that lye so farre dispersed into so many Countries, yet hereby vnited, and his wants supplyed both for warre and peace in a plentifull manner from all the parts of Christen∣dome, which are therefore partakers of his trea∣sure by a necessitie of Commerce,Spanish trea∣sure is exhau∣sted by a ne∣cessity of com∣merce. Wherein the Spa∣nish policie hath ever indevoured to prevent all other Nations the most it could; For, finding Spaine to be too poore and barren to supply it selfe and the West Indies, with those varieties of forraigne Wares, whereof they stand in neede, they knew well that when their natiue Commodities
come short to this purpose, then their monies must serue to make vp the reckoning; whereupon they found incredible aduantage by adding the traffique of the East Indies to the treasure of the West:Spanish poli∣cie and pro∣ffit in the East India trade. For the last of these being imployed in the first, they stored themselues infinitely with rich wares, to barter with all the parts of Christendome for their commodities, and so furnishing their own necessities, preuented others for carrying away theirmonies, which in poynt of State they hold lesse dangerous to impart to the re∣mote Indians then to their neighbour Princes, least it should too much inable them to resist (if not offend) their Enemies: And this Spanish policie against others is the more re∣markeable being done likewise so much to their owne aduantage; For, euery Ryall of Eight which they sent to the East Indies brought home so much wares, as saued them the disbursing of sixe Royalls of Eight here in Europe (at the least) to their neighbours; especially in those times when that trade was onely in their hands: but now this great prof∣fit is fayled, and the mischiefe remoued by the English and Dutch, who partake in those East India trades as amply as the Spanish Subiects. IT is further to be considered that besides the disability of the Spanyard, by their na∣tiue
commodities to prouide forraigne wares for their necessities (whereby they are forced to supply their wants with mony) they haue likewise that Canker of warre which doth in∣finitly exhaust their Treasure and disperse it into Christendome euen to their Enemies,Spanish Trea∣sure is exhau∣sted by warre. part by reprisall, but especially thorough a ne∣cessary maintenance of those Armies which are composed of many Strangers, and lye so farre remote that they cannot feede, cloath, or other wise prouide them out of their owne natiue meanes and prouisions, but must re∣ceiue this reliefe from other Nations:The effects of different warrs concerning Treasure. which kind of warre is farre different to that which a Prince maketh vpon his owne confines, or in his Nauies by Sea, where the Souldier receyuing monies for his wages must euery day deliuer it out againe for his necessities, wherby the Treasure rēaines still in the King∣dom, although it be exhausted from the Kinge but we see that the Spanyard (trusting in the power of his treasure) vndertakes Warres in Germanie and other remote places which would soone begger the richest Kingdome in Christendome of all their mony, the want whereof would presently disorder and bring the Armies to confusion, as it falleth out some∣times with Spayne it selfe (who hath the foun∣tayne of money) when either it is stopt in the passage by the force of their Enemies, or drawne out faster then it flowes by their own
occasions; whereby also wee often see that Gold and Siluer is so scarse in Spayne, that they are forced to vse base copper money, to the great confusion of their trade in want of supplies, and not without the vndoing also of many of their owne people. BVt now that wee haue seene the occasi∣ons by which the Spanish treasure is dis∣persed into so many places of the world;The Spanish treasure which is exhausted either by com∣merce or warre, doth all come in the end into the generall com∣merce of di∣uers Nations. it is needefull likewise to discouer, how and in what proportion each Country doth partake of these monies: For wee finde that Turkey, and diuers other Nations haue great plenty thereof, although they driue no Trade with Spayne, which seems to tontradict the former reason, where we say that this treasure is ob∣tayned by a necessitie of commerce; but to cleare this poynt we must know, that all Na∣tions (who haue no mines of their owne) are inriched with Gold and Siluer by one and the same meanes, which is already shewed to be the ballance of their forraigne trades, & this is not strictly tyed to be done in those Coun∣tries where the fountayne of treasure is, but rather with such order & obseruations in the trade and against excesse as are prescribed: for suppose England by commerce with Spayne may get and bring home Fiue Hundred thou∣sand Ryalls of Eight yearely, yet if wee loose as much by our Trade in Turkey, and there∣fore
carry the money thither, it is not then the English but the Turkes who haue got this treasure; although they haue no trade with Spayne, from whence it was first brought. A∣gaine if England hauing thus lost with Turkey, doe notwithstanding gaine twise asmuch by France, Italy, and other members of her gene∣rall trade, then will there remaine Fiue Hun∣dred thousand Ryalls of Eight cleare gaynes by the ballance of the same; and this com∣parison holds betweene all other Nations, both for the manner of getting, and the pro∣portion that is yearely gotten. But if yet a question should be made whether all Nations get Treasure, and Spayne onely loose it: wee answer no; for some Countries by warre or by excesse doe loose that which they had gotten, aswell as Spayne by Warre and want of Wares doth loose that which was its owne. ANd so much shall suffice to shew, that to pertake in the trade of the East Indis, doth not onely weaken the Spanyards Nauigation & strengthen our owne; but also to impeach him in this rich Trade, doth mightily ex∣haust his Treasure and increase our monies.
HAuing done with a powerfull E∣nemie the Spaniard, we must now say something of our professed friends, the Hollanders, who of late yeares are become a flourish∣ing People,The Hollan∣des greatnesse by Trade. Wealthy and strong, both by Sea and Land, by nothing else but Trade; and yet we know that they haue little in their owne Countrie wherewithall to Trade; but wee must not therefore imagine, that so great a building is either raysed or can stand without a strong foundation, which these industrious men wanting meanes in their owne Land, doe find out rich Mines in his Maiesties Seas; Golden Mines wee may terme them, for so the Lords States themselues doe call them,The Hollan∣ders best foun∣dation is the English Fish∣ing. and thus also in their publicke Proclamations, which they haue set forth in all occasions for the better preseruation of this Fishing, a trea∣sure it is (indeed) inestimable, and an imploy∣ment most profitable: From hence originally proceeds the increase & maintenance of their People, their flourishing Arts, their priuate wealth, their publicke Treasure, the multitude of their Ships which fetch materials, to build ships, the swarmes of their small Vessels which catch Fish, to lade their great Ships which Trade with Fish; the proceed whereof doth furnish them with all their wants of forraigne Wares, and makes them also rich in Treasure; with which Treasure they doe also enlarge
their Trade into all the quarters of the world, whereby they are become the Magazines for England, France, Spaine, Turkey, and other places, for Corne, Cordage, English Ord∣nance, Pouder, Shot, Ships, Wines, Fruites, Canuas, and many others, besides the rich Wares from the East and West Indies, ser∣uing each Countrie according to their seuerall wants and occasions: In which course of Trade, they are not lesse iniurious to supplant others (especially the English) then they are carefull to strengthen themselues with more then ordinarie diligence; for they know well, that, Trade hath raysed their Fortunes, and doth feede their Hopes; We desire not here to aggrauate their Actions against vs in the East Indies, for they are already too well knowne to all the World, but wee rather with patience expect the meanes of our satisfaction and fu∣ture safetie; wherein we doubt not of his Ma∣iesties most gracious fauours and resolutions so well begun, and in so good away to settle & support a Trade of such great consequence; the which if the Hollanders might soly enioy (as they endeauour) they would (by the pow∣er thereof) soone make themselues Masters (also) of our other best Trades into the Strei∣ghts,If our Trade to the East In∣dies should fall, our other best Trades will fal with it. and be the onely Marchants euen of our Cloth and other natiue Commodities into those Countries, as they are already possessed of the Exportation of (almost) all our Her∣rings
and Newland Fish, to the maintenance of their Shipping and decay of ours, which is the more considerable because it may be wish∣ed, that Victuals and Amunition, should either not be Exported, or else bee onely Ly∣censed to the naturall Subiects, but the Hollan∣ders are diligent obseruers of such occasi∣ons as may giue them aduantage; they know well how to worke their owne ends in all pla∣ces where they come, & as they haue infinitly preuailed in the augmentation of their Trade by the declination of other Nations, so they ayme at nothing more now then to weaken the English in their Trafficke, for wee onely are their Corriuals, able to keepe them from the absolute Dominion of the Seas, wherein we may hope euer to preuaile if we loose not the power we possesse, and the rich Trades which we haue so well discouered.
Whether it be not the best meanes we haue to increase the Trea∣sure or Money of this King∣dome.Treasure THis position is so contrarie to the common opinion, that it will require strong Arguments, to maintaine and prooue it, be∣fore it will bee accepted, especi∣ally of the multitude, who bitterly exclaime when they see any Monies carried out of the Realme; affirming thereupon that wee haue absolutely lost so much Treasure, being an Act against the long continued Lawes of this Kingdome, and that many other places, nay, Spaine it selfe (which is the fountaine of Mo∣ney) forbids the Exportation thereof, some cases onely excepted. To all which we might answere, that Venice, Florence, Gaenoa, Sauoy, Marcellis, Turkey, the Low-Countries, and diuers other places permits it, their people applaudes it, and find great benefit by it; but all this makes a noyse and prooues nothing: Wee must therefore come to those reasons which concerne the businesse in question. FIrst, therefore we will take that for graun∣ted which none will denie vs, that we haue
no other meanes to get Treasure but by For∣raigne Trade,We haue no treasure but by trade. for Mines wee haue none which doe affoord it, and how this Money is gotten in the mannaging of our said Trade, we haue already shewed, that it is done by ma∣king our Commodities which are Exported, to o∣uer ballance in Value the forraigne wares which we consume; so that it resteth onely to shew how our monies may bee added to our Com∣modities, and being ioyntly exported may so much the more increase our Treasure. ANd here we will suppose, that our yearely consumption of forraigne wares is to the valew of twenty hundred thousand poundes, and our exportations to exceed that two hun∣dred thousand poundes,A neere esti∣mation of our yearely expor∣tations and importations as they haue bin found by good inquirie. which sum wee may thereupon affirme is brought to vs in Trea∣sure to ballance the accompt; but now if wee add three hundred thousand pounds more in ready money vnto our former exportation in Wares, what profit can wee haue (will some men say) although by this meanes we should bring in so much ready money more then we did before, seeing that wee haue carryed out the like valew. TO this the answer is, that when we haue prepared our exportations of wares, and sent out asmuch of euery thing as wee can
spare or vent abroad; it is not therefore said, that then we should add our money thereun∣to to fetch in the more money immediately, but rather first to inlarge our trade therewith, by inabling vs to bring in more forraigne wares, which being sent out againe into the places of their consume, they will in due time much in∣crease our Treasure: For, although in this manner wee doe yearely multiply our impor∣tations to the maintenance of more shipping and Marriners, improuement of his Maie∣sties Customes and other benefits; yet our con∣sumption of those forraigne wares is no more thē it was before; so that all the sayd increase of commodities brought in by the meanes of our ready mony sent out as is afore written, doth in the the end become an exportation vnto vs of a farre greater value then our sayd monies were, which is proued by three seue∣rall examples following. FIrst, we wil suppose that one hundred thou∣sand pounds sterling, being sent in our ship¦ping into the East Cuntries, wil buy there one hundred thousand quarters of wheate cleare of all charges aboard the shipps, which being after brought into England and housed, to export the same at the best time for vent there∣of in Spayne or Italy, it cannot yeeld lesse in those parts then Two Hundred Thousand
Pounds to make the Marchant but a sauer, yet by this reckoning wee see the Kingdome hath doubled that Treasure. AGaine this proffit will bee farre greater when wee trade thus with our money in remote Countries,The trade to the East Indies (in its propor∣tion) is the best trade and meanes wee haue to in∣crease our Treasure. as for example, if wee send one hundred thousand pounds into the East Indies to buy pepper there and bring it hither, and from hence send it for Italy or Turkey, it must yeeld fiue hundred thousand pounds at least in those places, in regard of the excessiue charge which the Marchant disbourseth in those long voyages in shipping, wages, victu∣alls, insurance, interest, customes, imposts, and the like: all which charges notwithstan∣ding the King and the Kingdome gets. And wee may heere obserue, that as the publike proffit by forraigne trade is the onely meanes whereby we gaine our Treasure: So this trade to the East Indies (in its proportion) doth farre excell all others. THe third example is, where the voyages are short and the wares rich, which ther∣fore will not imploy much shipping, the pro∣fit to the Kingdome wilbe farre lesse; as when an other hundred thousand pounds shall be imployed in Turkey in raw silkes and brought hither to be after transported from hence into Fraunce the Low Countries or Germanie, the Marchant shall haue good gaine although he
sell it there for one Hundred and Fifty Thou∣sand Pounds: and thus take the voyages all together in their medium the ready monies exported will bee retourned vnto vs neere trebled. But if any man wil yet obiect that these returnes come to vs in wares, and not really in moneys as they were issued out. THe answer is, (keeping our first ground) that if our consumption of forraigne wares, bee no more yearely then is already supposed, and that our exportations bee so mightily en∣creased by this maner of Trading with ready money as is before declared: it is not then possible (in the course of trade) but that all the ouer ballance or difference should returne either in monie or in such wares as wee must Export againe; which as is already plainely shewed will bee still a greater meanes to in∣crease our Treasure: For it is in the stocke of a Kingdōe, as in the estates of priuate men, who hauing store of wares, doe not therefore say that they will not venture out, or trade with their money; (for this were ridiculous) but doe also turne that into wares, whereby they multiply their money; and so by a continuall & orderly change of one into the other grow rich, & when they please, turne al their estates into Treasure, for they that haue wares can∣not want money, and therefore the former obiection is not considerable: for what begot
the monies which wee sent out, but our wares. NEither is it said that Money is the life of Trade, as if it could not subsist or passe current without the same; for wee know that there was great Trading by way of Commuta∣tion or Barter, when there was little Money stirring in the world. The Italians and some other Nations haue such remedies against this want, that it can neither decay nor hinder their Trade, for they transferre Bils of Debt, and haue other wayes whereby they assigne their Credits from one to an other daily for very great summes with ease and satisfaction by Writing onely,Money inlar∣geth trade, and trade in∣creaseth mo∣ney. whilst in the meane time, the Masse of Treasure which gaue foundation, to those Credits is imployed in Forraigne Trade as a merchandize, which doth much in∣crease their Trafficke. It is not therefore the keeping of our Money in the Kingdome, which makes a quicke and ample Trade, but the necessitie and vse of our Wares in for∣raigne Countries, and our want of their com∣modities which causeth the Vent and Con∣sumption on all sides. VVE must not here forget the practise of the great Duke of Tuscany in his Port of Leghorne, which of late yeeres from a poore Towne is become a faire Citie, and one
of the most famous places for Trade in Chry∣stendome, by the resort of many Nations, but most especially by the English and Dutch with Merchandise, to a very great valew yearely, and yet it is worthy obseruation that the mul∣titude of Ships and Wares which come thi∣ther, haue little or no meanes to make their re∣turnes from thence, but onely in readie Money, which they may, and doe carrie away freely at all times and without Custome, and such charges to the incredible aduantage, of the said Duke of Tuscanie and his Subiects, who are much inriched by the continuall great concourse of Merchants, from all the States of the neighbour Princes, bringing them plen∣tie of Monye daily to supplie their wants of the said wares. And thus we see that the Cur∣rent of Merchandise which carries away their Treasure, becomes a flowing streame to fill them againe In a greater measure with Money. THe example of this growing greatnesse, hath lately mooued the Duke of Sauoy, publickely to declare his Princely resolution to all Nations, offering them many Priuiled∣ges and immunities, that shall come to Trade in his free Port of Vila Franca, and especially a libertie to carrie away ready Monyes for all the Wares they bring, or other occasions: and yet wee know that neither in Tuscanie or Sauoy, are any Mines or Monies more then
they haue and doe dayly get by trade; but they know likewise that if wee yearely bring them wares (although for a very great value) the money will immediately follow; For, let no man doubt but that monie must euer at∣tend on Marchandize, for they goe together: And it is worthy the noting that those Prin∣ces are content to part with their treasure on∣ly to inioy the trade of the wares which are brought them, for which (to encourage the Marchant) they take no Custome; whereas wee by sending out our money doe gayne the imployment of our shipping, the trade of the wares, and the proffit of the Customes which is a treble benefit. THere is yet an obiection or two as weake as all the rest: The first is, that if we trade with our money, wee shall issue out the lesse wares; as if a man should say, those Coun∣tries which heretofore had occasion to con∣sume our Cloath, Lead, Tynn, Iron, Fish, & the like shall now make vse of our monies in the place of those necessaries, which to affirme were most absurde, or that the Marchant had not rather carry out wares (by which there is euer some gaines expected) then to export money, which is still but the same without a∣ny encrease.
BVt on the contrary there are many Coun∣tries which may yeeld vs very large and profitable traffique for our money, that other∣wise afford vs no trade at all because they haue no vse of our wares, as namely the East Indies for one, in the first beginning therof although since by industry in our Cōmerce with those Nations we haue brought them into the vse of much of our Cloth, Leade, Tynn, and o∣ther things, which is a good addition to the former vent of our commodities. AGaine, some men haue alleadged that those Countries which permit money to be carried out, doe it, because they haue few or no wares to trade withall: but we haue great store of Commodities, and therefore their action ought not to be our example. TO this the answer is briefly; That if wee haue such a quantitie of wares, as doth fully prouide vs of all things needfull from beyond the Seas, why should wee then doubt that our monies sent out in trade must not necessarily come backe againe in Treasure. together with the great gaines which it may procure in such manner as is before set down? And on the other side if those Nations which send out their monies, do it because they haue few wares of their owne; how come they
then to haue so much Treasure as wee euer see in those places, which suffer it freely to be ex∣ported at all times and by whom so euer. We answer euen by trading with their monies: For by what other meanes can they get it, hauing no mines of Gold or Siluer? THus may wee plainely see, that when this waighty businesse is duely considered in its end (as all our humaine actions ought well to be weighed) it is found much contrarie to that which most men esteeme thereof,Our humane actions ought especially to be considered in their ends. because they search no further then the beginning of this worke, which misinformes their iudge∣ments and leades them into errour: For if wee only behold the actions of the Husbandman in the seede time, when he casteth away much good corne into the ground, we wil rather ac∣count him a madd man then a Husbandman: but when we consider his labours in the Har∣uest, which is the end of his indeauours; Wee finde the worth and plentifull increase of his actions. Whether it be not an honour sutable to the Maiestie of so great a King and King∣dome.Honour. WE haue endeauoured vpon all the former Queres to be as briefe as conueniently wee might with∣out obscurity, and now vpon this last poynt there will bee no
occasion at all to inlarge; for when it shall be found that the trade to the East Indies is so good a meanes to increase our strength, wealth, safety, and treasure, and that those discoue∣ries haue spread his Maiesties fame into Persia, Iapon, China, the Dominions of the great Mo∣gull, and many other remote Nations of the Easterne world, there will be no  deni∣all, but that these great blessings are so precious & honorable both to the King and his King∣domes, that they ought to bee preserued with our best endeauours against the strongest op∣position. And for conclusion the East India Compa∣nie doe humbly declare vnto this Honorable House, that they haue not made their Petition and this Remonstrance for their owne priuate ends, but for the publique good; And euen so hauing performed their duties, they hope it shall be their sufficient discharge in all fu∣ture times concerning the Suppressing or Sup∣porting of the said Trade. FINIS.
