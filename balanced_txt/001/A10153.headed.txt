¶De septima vtilitate tribulacionis. Cap̄ vii THe .vii. prouffyte of trybulacyon is that it / spredith abrode / or openeth thy herte to re¦ceyue the grace of god / For as a goldsmyth wyth many strokes of the hamer spredyth a pyece a brode of golde or of syluer to make a vesselle for to putte in wyne or precyouse lycoure / Soo almyghti god maker of euery creature ordeyneth trybulaciō to sprede or to open the soule to put therin yeftes of his grace. Wherfore eyth the prophete in ye psalme. ¶In tribulacione delatasti michi. ¶In tribulacion thou haste spredde a brode or ope¦ned to me / Therfore suffre gladly the strokes of tri¦bulacion. ¶For the more they spredde abrode the / herte in suffrynge pacyently / the more goostly yef∣tys our lorde god purtyth therin gracyously / And / considre that as the more precyouse metalle is mo∣re ductill and obeyeng to the strokys of the goldsm¦yth Soo the more precyouse a meke herte is more / pacyent in tribulacyon And all though the sharpe / strokys of tribulacyon greuously turmente the yet comforte the that the goldsmyth almyghty god hol¦deth the hamer of tribulacion in his honde and kno¦weth full well what thou mayste suffir and mesury¦ht his smytyng after thy freel nature ¶Ne will / thou not be thenne as metall in a boystouse gobet / wyth spredyng of sharpe as herde hertys ben wy∣thoute techynge In whiche god fyndeth noo place

that ben aboue. As an erthely lorde whan he wyll sell his wyne forbedyth all other to open her ta¦uernes tylle that he hath solde his. Sod oure lorde god somtyme forbedyth erthely comfortes that he may bryng forthe his comfortis and that is that be tokeneth by the prophete Ioel where it is sayd. ¶Bestie agri quasi area faciens ymbrem suspex∣erunt ad te quoniam exsiccati sunt fontes aquarum ¶The bestys of the felde ben as drye erthe desyrȳ∣ge rayne they loken vp to the see. for the well of wa¦ters ben drye.

De vndecima vtilitate tribulacionis. Caplm. xi. THe xi prouffyte of trybulacyon is that it ke∣pyth and nourysshyth the hertē / Sothely / ryght as fyre is kepte in asshes ryght so the hertes of the frendes of god aren kepte in trybulaci¦on. Therfore oure lorde god commaunded Exodi ¶Quod tabernaculum faccis cilicinis cooperietur That the tabernacle of god shuld de hyled wyth hei¦ren sackes the whiche shulde the fende / the presio{us} curteynes of softe sylke / and goddes ryche vesselles of golde or syluer ayenste wyndes and reynes In to¦ken that vertues of goddis seruauntes named me∣nes ben kepte in aduersytee of trybulacyon. For try¦bulacyon constreyneth the herte to thynke on the / wretchydnesse of his owne Infyrmytee / And so it constreyneth a man to be meke. ¶Whome worldly {pro}sperytee had haunsyd by vaȳglorye aboue hȳself
Also trybulacyon nourysshyth the herte as a norys / she her chylde. For as the moder wyth the chyld che¦weth harde mete / the whiche the childe may not che¦we / and draweth it in to her body where that mete / is turned into mylke to nourysshynge of the childe Soo cryste that in holy wryte is cleped oure moder for the gretnesse of his tēder loue that he hath to vs He chewed for vs bytter paynes / harde wordes re / preues / and sclaundres wyth bytternesse of his pas¦syon that suffred for vs to nourysshe vs / and strey / neth vs goostly by ensample of hym to suffre trybu¦lacyons and aduersytees of this worlde. As wyne that is clensed thoroughe a bagge fulle of spyces / chaungeth his owne sauoure drawynge to hym the sauoure of the spyce / Soo a man suffrynge trybula¦cyons and aduersytees of thys worlde oweth to clē¦synge by the blessyd body of oure lorde Ihesu consy¦derynge the passyon that he suffred for hym / And so it shall wexe swere and tollerable that to foresemyd full bytter and intollerable. ¶De duodecuna vtilitate tribulationis. Capitulum xii THe .xii. prouffyte of trybulacyon is that try¦bulacyon is a certeyn token of loue that god hath towarde hym that it is sente to Wher¦of he sayde. ¶Quos amo arguo et castigo. ¶Hym that I loue I vndernymme and chastyle / And al∣so Salamon sayde Ecclesiastici. ¶Qui diligit fili∣liū assidua et flagella· He that loueth his son he scour¦gyth hym ofte tyme. ¶Wherof sayde saynte Iero∣me.
¶Summus pater Ihesus Christus filios su¦os semper sub aliquo flagello vel virga retinet vt / quando eripiuntur ab vno sub alio capiuntur. ¶Oure souereyne lorde Ihesu cryste kepyth euer / his chyldren vnder a scourge or a rodde And whan they ben deliuered of one / they ben caughte vnder / a nother / But oure gode meke fader and lorde sen¦te not alle his scourgis at ones to geder / but one af∣ter a nother knowynge oure freelte / For he wyl that noo man perysshe / but he wyll all men be safe / But euyll men and vnkynde that byleue hym not ne lo∣uen hym the whiche lyuen here wythoute scourge of of trybulacion. Whome noo correccyon of chastysȳ¦ge maye wythdrawe from theyr errours god shalle punysshe wyth all his arowes of vengaunce / For so¦thely all tourmentys that now ben departed abou¦te in all the worlde thenne shall be gadered togyder and abyde as in her owne place / As oure lorde say¦de Deutrononni xxxii ¶Congregabo su{per} eos ma¦la. et sagitas meas complebo in eis. ¶I shal gader togyder euyll thynges vppon euyllmen. ¶And I shall spende all myne arowes of vengaunce amon∣ge hem. ¶Therfore thou good soule yf thou wylte be beloued of god wyll thou not putte awaye trybu¦lacyons. For they shewen to the tokens and wytnes of the loue of god. But perauenture yf thou sayste ye goddys chyldren taken of hym bothe good thyn∣ges & euyll thynges. Why is the takynge of euylle thȳges shewȳge or token of ye loue of god more thā ye takynge of gode thȳges. To this maye be answe∣ryd
that god yeuith many gode thynges and grete to his spyrytuell frendis and bytter and gretter to / theym that he louyth more / But the blessyd fader of heuen loued wythoute comparyson more his bl∣essid sone oure lorde Ihesu criste than all the worl¦de and yet he sente hym here many anguesshes po∣uertees tribulacyons aduersytees repreues and / scornynges betynges bydynges scorgynges many woundes and cruelle dethe but fewe temporell goo¦dis Thenne is the yefte of aduersitee more shewin∣ge token of loue of god than the yefte of temporelle prosperitee / Also ferthermore oure lorde Ihesu cri¦ste goddis sone that leued here in this worlde as a wyse marchaūte chose good marchaundyse and re¦fused the badde / For whan they wolde haue made hym kynge of Iude he refusid it and chase rather / to flee in to deserte And whan they soughte hym to tourmente hym and to slee hym he fleddee not but / he chase rather for to deye and sayde. ¶Ego sum I am he whom ye seke Thenne yf criste was wyses¦te ī chesynge ye whyche chase aduersitees they ben: moche foles that dispisen tribulacyon and aduersy / tees and chesen worldly prosperites that may not delyuer hem in tyme comynge from the hondes of her enmyes the cruell fendis Suffre thenne pacy∣ently wyth criste here tribulacyons that thou maye take afterwarde the crowne of lyfe in the blysse of / heuen For sothely otherwyse thou mayste not come to the blysse For the apostle sayth ¶Per mulcas tribulaciones oportet nos intrare in regum celorū
