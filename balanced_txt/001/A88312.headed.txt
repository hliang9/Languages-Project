JOHN LENTHAL.
THE PROPOSITIONS WITH SOME ADDITIONS. 1. THe Prisoners were desired to shew their Rea∣sons why a Law should not be made, to Se∣quester their Estates into the Hands of Com∣missioners nominated by their Creditors, as in the Statute of Bankerupt, to be Let or Sold, that their debts might be paid, and the remainder returned to them. 2. To shew their Reasons, why a Law should not al∣so be made, That if any of the Prisoners have made o∣ver their Estates, or any part thereof, in Trust, or other∣wise, to any Person, so as to defraud their Creditors; And if such Person or Persons shall not voluntarily make Discovery thereof, within a convenient time, to be appointed; That then, they shall forfeit of their own Estates the Value of what is so Concealed, and such fraudulent Acts made void.
3. Why the Creditors of such as are poor, and have not to pay their debts, their Credi∣tors having the benefit of Commissioners if they will, to examine their Debtors upon oath, and such other Witnesses as are neces∣sary for the discovering their Estates, paying as farre as it will extend, why such persons should not be released, so as to be set to la∣bour (if able) for bread for themselves or families: and if possible, to pay their just debts: That the Common-wealth, Credi∣tor, and Debtor may lesse suffer, and the Lord not provoked by the cruelty of the Creditor or carelesnesse of the Debtor. And all such poor Prisoners as are in want and not able to worke, may be released and relieved; That so Prisons may neither be places of protection to men of Estates, nor of destruction to such as have none. The answer by some of the Prisners to the first Proposition was; That they thought it reasonable, so as they might have like re∣liefe against their Debtors. Others said, that they lay in Prison for other mens debts, who dyed men of great
Estates, and left them to descend to their Children in Tayle, and they prayed their Estates might be made lyable to pay their Debts. Others said, they were imprisoned unjust∣ly, at the suite of Corporations, and those Corporations were indebted to them, and prayed that a Law might be made to make Corporations lyable to pay their debts. Divers Prisoners complained, that they were kept in Prison by feigned Actions, and no Declarations upon them, to shew for what cause; and when they had been so im∣prisoned three Termes, because then they might free themselves upon common Baile; their Adversaries would lay other feigned A∣ctions upon them, and so they were never like to get out. These and many other things of moment, for redresse in these cases, are under conside∣ration, and to be presented to the Councell of State for present reliefe.
