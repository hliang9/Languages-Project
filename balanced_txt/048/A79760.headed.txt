Stirling, 24 October, 1650. Ante-meridiem. A SHORT WARNING, From the Commission of the Generall Assemblie; Concerning the Malignants now in Arms. ALbeit the Designs and Carriage, of the Malignant partie now in Arms, and their Com∣plices, bee in themselues so many, and so manyfestly wicked, as may render them odious, and detestable, unto all the people of GOD, in this Land, at the first looking thereon; Yet the LORD having called vs thereunto, wee hold it our due∣tie (as here-to-fore) to giue Warning thereof; Both for the reclaming of these, who are already insnared therein, and for the guarding of others, agaynst Temptations thereunto.
Wee need not bee at much payns, in fynding out of these mens intentions; nor go far off, for Learning of the ends which they propose unto themselues, in their present actings; These being no other, than hath bene promoted by the Malignant partie from the beginning: To wit, the setting vp of them∣selues, under a pretence of Promoting Royall Authoritie, and kingly interest; That they may the more easily bear down these who haue bene instrumentall in the Work of GOD; and at last destroy the Work it self, a design which had bene to bee abhorred in any; but much more in these men, who are so So∣lemnly tyed before the LORD, by the Oath of the COVE∣NANT vnto the contrary, and agaynst whose former Malig∣nant wayes, and back-slydings, the LORDS Hand hath been lifted up so high, unto the breaking of the Pryde of their Power, oftner than once: And, who haue so lately bene offe∣ring and professing, before the CHURCH of GOD, their Repentance, for such things; as being convinced in their Con∣sciences of the Sinfulness, and Unlawfulness of the same: And, who stand under the Tye of so many Promises & Subscriptions, both to the State & Church, to the contrarie: Severall of the most eninent amongst them, do by these their late actions stand now proclamed before the World, & under their own hands, infamous & perfidious Covenant breakers: And, it doth much highten their iniquitie; That they haue conspired together a∣gainst GODS People, in such a tyme; when there is also an∣other Enemie in the Land, designing Mischief against Reli∣gion, and Government. Wee may say, Wee are brought low: But wee hope, That the LORD shall prevent vs, with His Mercies, and require it at their hands. If there bee any place left for exhortation, wee WVRN these men, to consider, How the Wrath & Vengeance of the LORD hath been persuing the Malignant partie, in all these Kingdoms, these many years past; and, how many tymes their own Designs haue bene blasted, and themselues brought nigh vnto Destruction; And, to remember what a severe Aven∣ger
the LORD is of Covenant-breaking, and of the open mocking of His NAME, by falling fouly agayn into these sinnes, which once haue bene confessed, & they seem to haue repented of: And what a foull stayn it is upon their Conscien∣ces and credit, to go contrary to so many late Professions, and violate so many Bands and Obligations, taken upon themselues for avoyding all Malignant Wayes, and not disturbing the Peace of the Kingdom: And, how monstrous and unnaturall a thing it is, to haue risen agaynst their Countrey, and the Pub∣lick Authoritie of the Land, when they had to do with a pre∣vayling Enemie; And, it shall bee Wisdom for these that are in Authoritie, to walk with Malignants, according to the rule of the Word of GOD, and Band of the COVENANT, to take good heed of trusting, and taking in, such as haue bene opposit to the Work of GOD, so many experiences teaching the unsoundness of most of these from year to year, which al∣so may teach all these who haue recovered themselues, out of such Snares, to take heed, that they bee not agayn involved therein; But that as they haue professed their Repentance, for their Accession to any Malignant courss, so they may labour to get their Hearts established through Grace, that they fall not back with others, into the same Sinne. AND, Wee exhort the whole LAND, To beware of Complyance, with these Sonnes of Beliall, either by joyning with them in Armes, or concurring in Counsell and Designs, or by assisting them with men, or moneyes, or provisions, or by corresponding with them, or countenancing of them, or conniving at their wicked wayes; As they would not draw Guilt vpon themselues, before the LORD, and proue Trea∣cherous and Unsteadfast in His COVENANT and CAUSE. THE Straytes and Sufferinges of His People, bee indeed, at this tyme, many and great: But it is better to suffer the hardest of Afflictions, than to sinne agaynst GOD, by com∣plying with an evill Courss: And, Wee are confident, That
vnto those who keep their Steadfastness, GOD shall open a Door of Hope, and make a Day of SALVATION to ap∣pear: Therefore, Let all men, in the Strength and Fear of the LORD, do their Duetie agaynst Enemies on both hands; And the LORD shall giue DELIVERANCE. A. Ker.
