A Solemn PROTESTATION OF THE Imprisoned and secluded Members OF THE COMMONS HOƲSE, Against the horrid Force and Violence of the Officers and Sol∣diers of the Army, on Wednesday and Thursday last, being the sixth and seventh dayes of December. 1648. WEE the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the Com∣mons House of Parliament, (above one hundred in number) forcibly seised upon, violently kept out of, and driven from the House, by the Officers and Souldi∣ers of the Army under Thomas Lord Fairfax, com∣ming thither to discharge our Duties on Wednesday and Thursday last, being the sixt and seventh of this instant December; do hereby, in our own Names, and in the Names of the respective Counties, Cities, and Bur∣roughs for which we serve, and, of all the Commons of England, Solemnly Protest and Declare to the whole Kingdome; That this Execrable Force and open Violence upon our Persons, and the whole House of COMMONS, by the Officers and Army under their Command in Marching up against their Command, and placing strong armed Guards of Horse and Foot upon them, without and against their Order, is the highest and most detestable force and breach of Priviledge and Freedome ever offered to any PARLIAMENT of ENGLAND; and that all Acts, Ordinances, Votes and Proceedings of the said House made since the sixt of December aforesaid, or hereafter to be made, during our restraint and forcible seclusion from the House, and the continuance of the Armies Force upon it, are no way obligatory, but voyd and null to all intents and purposes: And that all Contrivers of, Actors in, and Assistants to this unparallel'd Force and Treasonable Armed Violence, are open Enemies to, and professed Subverters of the Priviledges, Rights, and Freedome of Parliament, and disturbers of the Peace and Settlement of the Kingdome; and ought to be proceeded against as such: and that all Members of Parliament and Commoners of England, by their Solemn Covenant and Duty, under pain of deepest Perjury, and eternall Infamie, are obliged unanimously to oppose and endeavour to their utmost power, to bring them to exemplary and con∣dign Punishment for this transcendent Offence, tending to the dissolution of the present, and subversion of all future Parliaments, and of the Fundamentall Government and Laws of this Realm. All which we held it our Duties to Declare and Publish to the World, for fear our stupid silence should give any tacit consent or approbation to this most detestable crime, and make us guilty of betraying the Priviledges, Freedome and Honor of this Parliament, to our perpetuall reproach, and the prejudice of all succeeding Parliaments. Dated at Westminster. December 11. 1648.
