¶ The prologue. IN the begynnȳge of this newe yere / my good systers whan I consyder and se many frendes gyue tokens of custome one to another / whiche custome / some vse it for good lucke of a newe yere / some to {pro}cure carnal loue / some to get a greater be¦nefyte therby / some to gette worldely fauour or maynte∣naunce in yll / some to please & flatter them that ben yll / (whiche causes ben not commendable) some to procure loue and to contynue frendshyp and peas in the comune lyfe / bytwene neyghbour & neyghbour / whiche is ryght good and conuenyent to do. And some with ryght godly intent to purchace ghostly loue. For one ghostly frende to remembre another the more hartely in prayers / whi I thynke ryght commēdable. And after this intent (as I suppose) dyuers of you haue gyuen tokens vnto me. Wherfore hauynge nothynge redy to gyue vnto you a∣gayne / I purpose in my mynde to prepare one token for you all / to profyte eche of you. This token thynke it tru∣ly I haue not of my selfe / but of god / as I haue herde & redde of holy doctours / and by coniecture of the waye to good lyuynge / and nothynge by experyence of my selfe. It is full vnsemynge to me for to shewe or wryte vnto you of the waye to vertue / whiche am not yet all out of ye way of wyckednes. Yet a gryndyngston maketh a knyfe bryght & sharpe / thoughe it be neuer the sharper it selfe. So I maye moeue you to make you sharpe & quycke to ghostly thynges & to clerenesse of good lyuynge / though I my selfe be ryght slowe and dull vnto the same. To teche goodnesse is a thynge that may not be vndone / of them that haue cure & rewle of other persones / though
they do but lytell good themselfe. Cryst sayd of the pha∣rysyes rulers of the people. Do as they saye / but not as they do. Not withstandynge our lorde hathe gyuen me a desyre to do well. I beseche hym I maye haue grace to perfourme my desyre to his pleasure / honoure & laude. Therfore though my symple lyuȳge can styrre you but lytell. I trust that my good wyll and desyre that I haue to your ghostly profyte shall mcyte you bothe to encreace the more in vertu / and also to helpe me with your pray∣ers vnto the same. Alytell Dyetary for your dayly con∣uersacyō I purpose for to wryte / deuydȳge it into. xxiiij consyderacyons / as the daye is deuyded into. xxxiiij. hou∣res / whiche though it be rudely wryten / it maye profyte you moche / yf ye wyll dylygētly put it ī execucyon of wor¦kynge / and elles it profytech lytell / but rather hurteth. For cryst sayth a sermaunte that knoweth ye wyll of his mayster and wyll not do therafter shalbe bette with ma∣ny great strokes. And who soeuer studyeth for the wyll of god & forgete it not / but dylygētly put it to workynge / he shalbe blessed of god / and haue euerlastynge Ioye for so doynge / yf he perceyuer therin.
¶ To remembre that we ben pylgrymes and to what place we ben towarde. IT is necessary fyrst to cōsyder / that we bē here in this lyfe as pylgrymes / hauynge no longe restynge place / but alwayes beynge forwar∣des other to heuen were we shall haue eternall reste / orels we ben in the wronge way / the whi∣che shall lede vs to euerlastȳge sorowe. Lerne to knowe that one waye fro that other. And than euery daye whā ye shall go to do ony thynge / aske this questyon of youre selfe / sayenge in your mynde to your selfe. Whyder arte thou goynge / consyderynge wysely / whyder ye bē in ye waye of vertue or wyckednes / folowynge cryste or the deuyll / in the waye to heuē or to hell. And saye these ver¦ses. Vias tuas domine demonstra michi: et se mitas edoce me. Dirige me in veritate tua et doce me: {qui}a tues deus saluator me{us}: & te susti¦nui tota die. Set god for ye marke that ye wyll go vn∣to / take his commaundementes for youre waye & ronne stedfastly therin. Haue good hope in his goodnes / vtter¦ly dystrustynge the dysceyuable cōsolacyons of ye worlde / thrugh the whiche many soules bē dysceyued. ¶ The precyousnesse of tyme and the shortnesse of the same. SEcundarely it is to consyder the precyousnes of tyme / whiche is gyuen vs to do penaūce in / for our lyfe past and to labour for Ioye in the lyfe to come. And how that god shall requyre
of euery persone how he hath expended the tyme gyuē vnto hym. And thynke that euery tyme not spent to his honour is loste / and shalbe straytly punysshed. Behelde how short our tyme is / and how vncertayne / beynge no thynge surer but onely this tyme present / yt is but now / hauynge alwaye dethe suspecte / that cometh vpon vs sodeynly many dyuers wayes. And make alwaye a sure rekenynge for the tyme past. Sayenge this prayer day¦ly. O bone Ihesu: sint corāte in obliuione me∣a tempora preterita valde male consumpta. Et concede: vt hoctemporis mei residium: ti∣bi sit honorificum: michi fructuosum et proxi¦mo edificatorium. Qui viuis et regnas cum¦deo. &c. That is to say in Englysshe. O good lorde Ihe∣su let all my tymes past be forgoten before the / yt I haue consumed very yll. And graunt that this resydew of my tyme may be vsed in honour & worshyp vnto the / fruyte full vnto my selfe / and edyfyenge to my neyghbour / whi¦che lyuest with god the fader in vnyte of the holy ghost worlde without ende. Amen. And at euery tyme that ye clocke dothe stryke / consyder that your lyfe is shorted by an houre / sayenge thus to our lady / for to socour you at ye houre of dethe. Maria plena gratie: mater mise∣ricordie: tu nos ab hoste protige: & in hora mor¦tis suscipe. Mary moder full of grace / moder also of mercy / defende vs from our enemy / and at the houre of dethe / take vs to thy proteccyon. And so I truste there shall come great grace therof. ¶ How god is present to vs and his angell.
REmembre alwaye that what soeuer ye do / our lorde god is alwaye present / seynge and consy∣derynge euery thought / worde / and dede / and straytly shall call vs to a accōpte for thē. Ther∣fore it is necessary to obserue good maner and reuerent behauyoure / bothe inwarde in mynde / and outwarde in body / aswell in chambre or cell as in other secrete places / as in presence of great astates / hauynge alwaye honour and reuerence to god / and to our good angell / ferynge & beynge ashamed to do that thynge in ye presence of god / yt ye sholde be ashamed of in ye presence of men. And whā ye bē alone / saye oftē this verse. Qui cognoscis ocul¦ta cordis: parce peccatis nostris. Lorde that know est the pryuytes of harte / we beseche the spare vs / that we be not dampned for our synnes / and great offences. ¶ Not onely the body / but also the mynde muste be sparred vs from the occasyons of yll. THynke though ye sholde be closed vp within. iiij. walles. It is not ynough to haue your bo∣dyes sparred frome the occasyons of yll / wher ye mynde is wandrynge abrode in carnall plea¦sure / musynge vpon worldly vanytes / besyed with wor¦kes and maters of other persones / and carynge moche for youre frendes and kynnesfolkes / occupyed somtyme with vnlawfull and vnclenly thoughtes and desyres. Therfore ye muste close vp also your mynde and affeccy on fro all suche thynges. And that must be by often and contynuall remembraunce of god / as nere as ye maye. Close vp and hyde youre loue and mynde in ye depe and large woundes of our lorde Ihesu cryste by deuoute re∣membraunce
of his pytefull passyon / alwaye abydynge there / for there our enemyes dare not medle / but why∣der ye wyll or not / they wyll entre with you into the ma¦teryall cloyster / youre enemy the flesshe must nedes in / ye deuyll wyll not be behynde. And as I suppose / ye shall haue of hym more force and stronger batayle there than euer ye had before. And that we thȳke now ryght lytell and easy / shall than perchaunce be full harde and greuo¦us to ouercome. Therfore prepare youre selfe manly. Stande fast in fayth / and remembre ye rewarde of your vyctory / trustynge in god onely for strength. ¶ How the worlde bryngeth in trouble vnto rely∣gous persones. THe worlde trusseth his gere & hydeth them in a corner of a mannes soule / vnto ye tyme that he is entred into relygyon. And than the de∣uyll bryngeth them to lyght. So that those vanytes / synnes / and inquyet besynesse / that ye haue sene / herde / and ben in / shall than come to remē∣braunce / whiche now ye bē nothynge troubled with / as hyden within you. Than also the worlde shall sende vnto you by crafte of the deuyll / tydynges and tale berers whiche shall lette you of great profyte / yf ye be not ware. Sparre them out therfore and auoyde them from you / and neuer be gladde to here worldly rumours / ne vayne talkynge. Let not the deuyll hyde vp suche thynges in youre soules that afterwarde maye put you to trouble. Be neuer gladde to talke and here of other persones yll demenour / of theyr beaute / theyr countenaunce / theyr apparell / and specyally of detraccyon or backbytynge of
ony maner of persones / but rather flee theyr company / or moeue them to saye well / and to speke that is honeste and conuenyent for to here / sayenge thus before ye shall speke wt ony worldely persones. Domine libera ani mam meam a labiis iniquis & lingua dolosa. Good lorde I beseche the delyuer my soule from ye lyp∣pes of wycked men & from a dysceyuable tongue. ¶ To order well euery tyme auoydynge ydelnesse. THan after the counseyll of some good mā dys∣pose and order euery tyme of the day to some profyte bodely or ghostly. So that ydlenesse before all thynges maye be vtterly excluded. For ydlenesse is the moder of all yll / stepdame to vertue / forger of vnclennes / the way to vnstablenesse nuryssher of vyces / increacer of slouthfulnesse / kynde∣ler of malyce and inuye. It soweth yll thoughtes. It gē¦dreth yll desyres / and bryngeth forth many yll workes. It maketh vs wery of ghostly lyuȳge. It putteth vs in fere of ghostly batayle / and dryueth vs frome the waye of penaunce. O fals ydelnes how many doest yu deceyue. Ydelnesse is the snare that the deuyll hydeth ymonges ye grasse of the grene flourysshynge youthe / and ymonges the fallyngeleues leues of the vayne worldely Ioye and plea¦sure / and very harde it is to scape it. Therfore beware that the deuyll in no wyse fynde you in this snare / but yf ye be caught therin / breke out betymes before he catche holde vpon you. For whan he hathe holde vpon you / it is harde to breke awaye. ¶ How we sholde gyue vs to dyuers exercyses.
ANd bycause our mynde whiche is moche sub∣iecte vnto vanyte whyles we ben in this lyfe / abydeth neuer lōge in one state. Therfore we must dryue away ydelnes by dyuers chaūge of good exercyses. As somtyme by good hande worke / & conuenyent bodyly labour. Somtyme in prayer / som∣tyme in study / or redynge of scrypture or of some good workes of holy doctours. Somtyme ī medytacyon and contemplacyon yf ye can attayne therto. And se ye youre hande warke be other to the honour of god / to ye profyte of poore people / orels for youre owne necessyte. And in euery thynge that ye shall do. Se fyrst that it be lawfull for you to do it. Secūdarely yf it become you for to do it. Thyrdely whyder it be expedyēt for to do it. For all thȳ∣ges that ben lawfull and semynge for you to do / are not to be done / but yf they ben expedyent. Saynt Poule to wytnes. Omnia michilicēt: set non omnia mi∣chi expediunt. Therfore that thynge that is semȳge expedyent and not agayne the commaundement of god performe it / sayenge before euery worke. In nomine pa¦tris. &c. with a Pater noster and un Aue maria. ¶ Of exercyse in prayer and study. YOure prayers besydes the houres of dewty whiche must be preferred before ony thȳge / ye maye prolonge or make short as the holy ghost gyueth grace of deuocyon or good de∣syre. And beware that longe prayer gender not tedyousnesse. For better it is to praye often breuely wt deuocyon / than longe vndeuoutly / excepte deuocyon be inspired by longe desyre. Beware also ye make no bande
ne bone of nombre of psalmes or prayers / but vse them for the tyme that ye haue pleasure and deuocyon in thē. And where deuocyon slacketh / than go to redynge or to some other exercyse / so confortynge your spyrytes / auoy¦dynge the synne of slouth. In your study and redynge of bokes se that they ben conuenyent for you. And marke well all suche thynges as make to the exemple of good lyfe / bothe for to fele at your selfe / and to shewe it vnto o∣ther for the same intent. And before ye go to rede or stu∣dy / saye thus. Spiritus sancti gratia illuminet corda et corpora nostra. With a Pater noster. That is the grace of the holy ghost lyght on vs bothe soule and body. And after your redynge / remembre brefely what ye haue redde / and than say thus. Confirma hoc de¦us quod operatus es in nobis. With a Pater no∣ster. How to be ordred at your vprysynge / whan ye wake in the mornynge from slepe after the houre assygned to ryse. Forthwith lyfte vp your harte to god / cōmytynge youre selfe to his proteccyon / and gyue hym thākes / for that he hathe preserued you that nyght past / sufferynge no vayne thoughtes to fall into your mynde / but short∣ly blesse you and fall vnto your prayer. Be neuer ouerco∣men with sluggysshnesse ne dulnesse of body / as some bē that with gronynge and grutchynge ryse oute of theyr beddes. But with a quycke mynde put awaye all slouth as though cryst our spouse dyd call you vnto maryage / sayenge to youre selfe. Ryse thou wretched body oute of of thy couche / make the redy and lyght thy lampe / go mete with thy spouse / and do thy duty leest thou be refu∣sed for comynge to late. Be not longe in ye apparyllynge of youre selfe / but apply you vnto your worke or seruyce
enioyned to you for to do. With gladnesse of mynde lette no vanytes appere in youre apparell / but kepe alwaye a semynge fourme and an vnyfourme waye in your dres∣synge / vsynge nother to rude vesture ne to precious / but in a meane / no wyse desyrynge to please the worlde by it / but to honour god. Cal also beseli vnto god for his helpe and grace / that ye maye be stronge agaynst the malyce and power of your enemyes. For many haue bē in great peryl bothe of body and soule / bycause they haue not bles¦sed them selfe & honoured god at theyr vprysynge. Ther¦fore saye alwaye whan ye ryse some blessynge and pray∣er / as ye maye fynde in dyuers bokes. ¶ Of herynge masse. IF it may be / here masse euery daye. For by that ye be made the more able to all good workes in the day folowynge / and prosper ye better in eue∣ry thynge. In masse tyme be dylygent asmoche as ye maye to haue deuocyon / commyttynge youre selfe and all that longeth vnto you to hym that is there present. The masse is the veray memoryall of Cry¦stes passyon. Than yf ye wyl haue deuocyon / fall to some medytacyon of Crystes holy passyon. For there is no∣thynge that kyndelyth mannes affeccyon so soone as ye medytacyon therof. Yf ye wyl be perfytely purged from vyces. Yf ye wyll be indued with vertues. Yf ye wyll be lyghtned with vnderstandynge. Yf ye wyl haue vyctory of youre enemyes. Yf ye wyll haue consolacyon in aduer¦syte. Yf ye wyll haue swetenesse with teres in your pray∣ers. Yf ye wyll departe pleasaūtly oute of this lyfe. Yf ye wyll haue redely euerlastynge ioye. Vse deuoute medy∣tacyon
of crystes passyon in your masse herynge. And al∣so euery other tyme before ye shall praye. The masse is of merueylous great effecte. For after the sayenge of sa∣ynt Austyn. By euery masse deuoutly sayd is there one soule delyuered out of purgatory / and one synner cōuer∣ted. Therfore here masse deuoutly / besechynge our lorde sayēge. Blessed Ihesu let me sȳner be ye persone ye shalbe stedfastly conuerted vnto the. And say this prayer. Aīa cristisanctifica me. And whā ye be comonde / se that ye dyspose your selfe before with hye deuocyon & meke∣nes / by contrycyon / confessyon / and deuoute prayers / so that ye maye receyue your maker to the saluacyon and strength of youre soules. And after to contynu the more stedfast in vertu. ¶ How goddes seruyce and prayer sholde be sayde. THe seruyce that ye be commaunded for to say and al that longeth to obedyence / se that ye ful¦fyll moost dylygently before all thynge. For o∣ther prayers ben not acceptable to god / yf ye leue on those thynges that ye are bounde to of dewte. Therfore whan the bell ryngeth to seruyce / consy¦der as it were ye trumpe that shalbe blowen at ye Iudge∣ment. Than hye you faste to chyrche wt great mekenesse and fere / to treat and dyscusse youre causes before god ye moost hye Iudge / moost myghty / moost ferefull / moost wyse / moost tyghtwyse / but yet moost mercyfull. Remē∣bre that he is mercyful to all them that ben meke & obe∣dyent / and theyr complayntes and petycyons onely he delyteth to here. Therfore dyspose your self to mekenes afore your prayer / by some medytacyon / as of your syn∣full
lyfe wt sorynes therfore / of your fewe merytes & in∣numerable demerytes / of ye dayly mysery in this lyfe / of ye infynyte peynes for synne after this lyfe. Of the great endelesse Ioye in heuē / of the great goodnes of god / for delayenge our punysshement / for yt we sholde amēde our lyfe. Of ye great mercy of our sauyour Ihesu / sufferynge bytter passyon for our redempcyon. Whiche al / but these pryncypally ben great causes for to meken our hartes / & to serue god deuoutely. And whan ye haue great deuocy¦on by mekenesse. Saye your seruyce & prayers not onely in your one persone / as for your selfe / but in the persone of our moder ye holy chyrche. In yt whiche there bē some as prysoners in ye peynes of purgatory. Some as tray∣tours that ben obstynate synners. Some as suers for theyr pardon yt ben penytent. Some as mynysters and seruauntes that ben in the state of grace. Some ben assy¦stent wt god / to be our patrones and vocates they ben ho¦ly angels & sayntes. Now ymagyne that somtyme oure lorde speketh vnto vs / & we somtyme vnto hym in oure psalmes and other seruyces that we saye. And somtyme we treat for the prysoners. Somtye we cōplayne of our aduersaryes. Somtyme we desyre hȳ to spare his tray∣tours / yt they may haue space to amende. Somtyme we labour to our patrones & vocates for to helpe to opteyne fauour & grace. Somtyme we magnyfy his power / his wysdome / his goodnesse / with lawe and prayse. Ther∣fore thynke it no lytell cause that ye come to chyrche for. Before a temporall kynge causes ben dyscussed / for this bodyly lyfe with great dylygēs / fere / & reuerēce. Moche more thā ought we wt great mekenes / reuerēce / & fere / dyscus our ghostly maters for the safegarde and promo¦cyon of our soules before the hygh Iudge. And thoughe
ye vnderstande not what ye saye / consyder that ye bē as a poore wretche yt hath a complaynt or supplycacyon to put vnto the kynge / made by a lerned man / wherin all your desyre is conteyned more expedyently / than ye can do it your selfe. Thus remēbre where and in whose pre∣sence ye bē / and for what cause. And before ye go to your seruyce call for grace and saye. Rex christe clemētis∣sime: tu corda nostra posside: vt tibi laudes de bitas: reddamus omni tēpore. Suffer not youre mynde to wāder as nere as ye maye. And saye after eue¦ry houre where ye haue ben neclygent. Deus propiti¦us esto michi peccatori. And whan ye haue sayd yt is your duty / than saye your other prayers and memory∣es of sayntes as your deuocyon is moeued. To haue a synguler deuocyon to some specyall sayntes. IT is very good to haue a synguler deuocyon / to some specyall sayntes / in whome ye haue great confydence to be youre aduocates / hel∣pers / and defenders at all nedes to call on thē / whiche maye opteyne for you yt ben not worthy or able of your selfe. But moost specyally in ony wyse to haue ye glo¦ryous quene of heuē moder of cryst at all tyme in moost louynge reuerence with moost hardy affeccyon louynge vnto her / as to moste sure refuge in all nedes / perylle / & temptacyons / takynge her next cryst / for moost hye and trusty vocate / gyuynge euery daye some synguler laude & prayer to her mercyful goodnes. And yt your deuocyon and reuerēce to her made / be yt more acceptable. Study to folowe her in pure chastyte & clennes of body & soule
with all mekenesse of herte and lowlynesse to euery per∣sone in worde and dede. We haue so many enemyes and they ben so crafty / that without her helpe & other holy sayntes / we are not able to escape theyr daunger. The fore chose you suche patrones yt may helpe you in this daūgerous lyfe / and defende your soules from all cruell enemyes at the houre of dethe specyally / and brȳge you gracyously to perpetuall safegarde. ¶ Te commendacyon of vyrgynyte. REmembre wysely to whome ye bē despoused. Whome ye desyre to haue in maryage / & pray hym mekely that hathe inspyred you with so good wyll / and gyuen you suche desyre to pre∣serue and perfourme the same. Ye haue promysed youre vyrgynyte to Cryst. Thynke this came not of your selfe For it is vnpossyble so to do and contynue / but onely by grace. Consyder howe precyous a tresoure ye bere in a frayle vessell. Remembre what rewarde / what glory / what crowne of Ioy ye shall haue / by kepynge of pure vyrgynyte. And fere what peyne / what shame / what cō∣fusyon / what dāpnacōn ye shall fall in yf it be lost. What treasure is better than that / wherwith ye maye by heuē. wherin angelles greatly delyte. Wherby Cryste hȳ selfe is allect and moeued to loue you specyally. And to gyue (not onely hymselfe) to you / but also euery thynge that is good. The swetenes of meke vyrgynyte gaue so swete an odour into heuen / that it made the kynge of all kyn∣ges to haue suche a celestyall concupyscēce and loue vn∣to the moost meke vyrgyne Mary yt he descended frome heuen to erth for to be maryed vnto oure nature / but ye
shall not be crowned tyll ye be well proued as golde in ye furneys. For scrypture sayth / that he that is not tēpted is not proued. Vyrgynyte is golde / your Cell is the fur∣neys / temptacyon is the fyre / the deuyll is the kyndler and blower of this fyre / your body is the erthen vessell / wherin this golde is put to be proued. Whiche vessell yf it be broken by ony vyolent fyre / the golde is shedde out and loste / and the vessell can neuer be repared and made hole agayne. ¶ Vyrgynyte can not be get ne kepte without great labour and peyne. SEynge yt chastyte & vyrgynyte bē gyftes of a spyrytuall grace of god & nothȳge of our mery¦tes. For we can not be chast or contynent / but yf god gyue it vs by grace. Therfore they ben vnworthy to haue so noble a gyfte ye refuse to take some labour & peyne for it. They yt thynke to be chast ymōges delyces & deynte cherysshynges of ye body / they yt wyl be cōtynent where great feestynge is & deynte fare / they ye fere not to be cōuersaūte ymōges vnchast & ryotous per∣sones / & not to be tēpted for to be forced wt etynge & dryn∣kynge & not to be defiled / to hyde fyre in theyr bosome / & not to be brent / they are sore dysceyued. For I thynke it very harde orels inpossyble. Therfore beware ye bē not dysceyued presumynge to moche in these thynges vpon your owne strength. For wtout great cōtrycyon & afflyc∣cyon of the flesshe & great helpe of gracce / true chastyte can nother be get nor kepte. Remēbre yt glasse is frayle & may endure no dystresse. Also great aduētures many ty¦mes do curs ye dyce. Therfore beware ye ioperde not to ferre / but euermore eschewe ye occasyōs of yl. For ye wyse
mā sayth. Whosoeuer loueth {per}yl he shall perysshe therin ¶ Of the vertue of sadnesse. SE yt ye be of sadde behauyour / bothe ī mȳde and outwarde gesture. Kepe your mȳde dy∣lygently in sadnes & gyue it all to spyrytuall exercyses / sufferynge no vayne thoughtes to reste therin. And myghtely subdew ye concu∣pyscence & passyons of ye body / as wrath / carnall loue / bo¦dely or worldly fere / sensuall ioye / or dysolute laughynge For ye can not be well ordred outwarde / but yf these ben ordred & well ruled inwarde / but yet ye outwarde beha∣uyour helpeth moche to ouercome these inwarde passy∣ons. And therfore it behoueth to kepe wysely ye bodyly. v. wyttes yt ye shal se / here / or touche / nothynge yt sholde styrre you to yll / or dysteyne good maners / kepe youre syght close towarde ye erthe / cōsyderynge ye the eye is a these / & wyll betraye the soule yf it be not warely kepte. Fyxe not your syght vpon beawtefull thynges and here no vayne ne vycyous comynge / ferynge lest dethe wyll entre in at youre wyndowes & infecte your soules with synne. Of sadnesse & dyscrecyon in speche & other behauyoure. MOost dylygently refrayne youre tonge & speke not wtout a reasonable questyon be made vnto you / orels whā ye ben constrayned by euydent nede / & than study to gyue an answere brefely & mekely spekynge wt sad coūtenaunce / reuerēce / & swete fere of god / exchewynge alway talkȳge & ye occasyons of ye same / excepte it be of ghostly maters / & wt ryght ghost¦ly persones. Speke nothȳge but yf it be semynge for ye
tyme / place / & persone. Myxte your honest myrth wt sad¦nes / bothe in in speche / laughȳge / & gesture of body / wt∣out rownynge or castynge ye syght towarde ony persone suspectly wtout lystynge or moeuynge of the heed or ony other mēbre vnsemyngely. Be gentyll wtout grutchȳge. youre coūtenaunce lowly & cherefull wtout frownynge / lowrynge or derysyon. Whā ye speke / lawgh / or smyle / se it be wtout scornynge or lowde voyce. Be not to hasty nor to slowe in your goynge. Shewe no slouggysshnesse in in your restynge. Inquyre not of other persones cōuer∣sacyons ne cōsyder theyr defautes. Refourme ye is amys in other persones wtout ony reprouynge. Nother prayse ne dysprayse your selfe / nor greatly other {per}sone. Speke nothynge to be reputed holy or cōnynge. Gyue place to Ire betymes & to thē yt multyply wordes agaynst you / & forgyue shortly theyr errour or neglygence. And thus ye shall kepe ye vertu of sadnesse / & dyscrecyon / whiche is is a great helpe to chastyte / & to all other vertues. Wher to saȳt Poule dothe moeue vs / sayenge. Let your sadnes be knowen to all men. And so by good exemple ye maye profyte other & meryte very moche. ¶ How refeccyon ought to be take. AAs a seke mā receyueth his medycyne / so take your bodyly refeccyon. A seke mā thȳkes his medycyne very bytter therfore he wyll take no more thā shall suffyse for his helthe / & yf he do / it may be to his hurte / so in lykewyse consyderynge the peryll vnto chastyte that is in meetes and drynkes / they sholde be bytter vnto you / nothȳge gladde to take ony more thanne sholde susteyne nature / ferynge by to moche etynge and drynkynge for to gyue strength vnto
your aduersary / and to nourysshe youre pryue enemy / increasynge sekenes of the soule. Therfore whan ye go vnto your meet / thynke alwaye vpon your chastye / fe∣rynge lest the venym that is hyddē in meet and drynke do not infecte the body with carnall luste or slouth. And so consequently the soule by concupyscence & neclygence in the seruyce of god. Saynt Ierom techeth holy vyr∣gynes wylleth that after they bē passed chyldehood and growynge aege they sholde ete no flesshe / ne drynke no wyne / excepte the tyme of sekenesse. And commaundeth that suche sobrenesse sholde be kepte in meet and drynke that the body sholde rather complayne / than to reioyce in full appetyte / so that the stomake sholde not nede me∣dycynes / for to cause degestyon / but so to breke the appe¦tyte of the body / that it be not lesse apte vnto watchȳge / prayer / study / or contemplacyon after the mele / than it was before. The wyse man Salomon sayth. I haue de¦termyned wt my selfe in mynde to restrayne my flesshe frome wyne. For this intent. That I myghte gyue my mynde vnto wysedome and conynge / and eschewe foly. Foly can not be auoyded / nor godly wysedome opteyned but by abstynence frome moche etynge and drynkynge. Therfore sayth our sauyoure Cryst. Take hede yt youre hartes ben not accombered with Glotony. Exemple we haue of Danyell / Ananya / Mary / and Mysaell / chyldrē of great abstynence. To whome our lorde gaue excellēt wysdome and connynge / so that they exceded ferre all ye wyse lerned men in the kynkedome of Babylon. And all that euer haue had the grace of holy wysdome of deuout contemplacyon / or reuelacyon hath come by it / by mea∣nes of abstynence. And constrary. Moche etynge & dryn∣kȳge haue caused moche synne and foly. As it appereth
of Noye and Loth with other / & of ye ryche Glotone in the gospell. Sewe not sensuall appetyte therfore to his full desyre. So prouyde to your nede / that ye may swage hūger / & yet not satysfy your bodyly appetyte. Regarde not the deyntynesse of meetes and drynkes / but nedely sustentacyon of the frayle body contynually decayenge. And beware ye voluptuousnes crepe not in vnder ye cloke of nede. Some there ben ye fere great abstynence or wat chynge / bycause of sekenes or wekenes of body / ferynge to be not strōge to serue god. And I fere me many tymes it is but Excusatio in peccatis. For full fewe ther bē that haue that feruour or loue to watche or to absteyne so moche. And yf they had for the loue of god. I thynke he wolde gyue them dyscrecyon withall / or otherwyse pro∣uyde for them. I praye god it be not to moche / that ma∣ny thynke to lytell. True dyserccōn is to preferre ye soule before the body / whiche can not be without some peyne of the body. ¶ Of behauynge at the borde. SYt honestly at your meet. Gyue place to youre better / bothe in order of syttynge and in fyrste takynge of youre meet. Vse no Ianglynge / tryflynge / nor lyghtnes at ye borde / & hate vt∣terly detraccyon & backbytynge. Be content with suche as is sette before you without grutchynge / and fede not of to many dysshes nor to gredely. For in many meetes saythe ye wyse man ye can not fayle of sekenesse. And as ye fede ye body with bodyly fode / so fede ye soule wt ghostly fode / as by redynge of some holsome and ghostly werkes wherin your soules maye be edyfyed / gyue dylygence to
the herynge therof with all sylence / youre mynde and intent set holy therupon. And as ye se some great esta∣tes of theyr charytable goodnes wyll se some poore peo∣ple be serued afore them selfe. So in lyke wyse ghostly / before euery mele serue those poore soules in purgatory that haue leest helpe / with a pater noster and an aue ma¦ria / before ye serue your owne bodyes. And ye shall de∣serue (I thynke) ryght great mercy and rewarde of god therfore. Before ye ete ony mete / lyfte vp youre hartes deuoutely to god with laude and prayse to hym and say grace / besechynge hym to blesse your meet and you / so yt the refeccyon whiche ye shall take / maye be to strengthe you in his seruyce / not ferȳge the body to rebell agaynst the soule. After meet gyue thankes to god deuoutely wt sayenge grace / addȳge at ye laste ende this lytell prayer. Deus det viuis gratiam: defunctis misericor¦diam: ecclesie sue pacem: domino apostolico & nobis peccatoribus vitam eternam. Amen. Wherto is graunted. lxv. yeres of pardon. ¶ How to be occupyed after meet / and to beware of temptacyon. AFter your dyner go to youre worke / study / or prayer as ye ben assygned to / and do that dy∣lygently / remembrynge alwaye god & youre good angell present what soeuer ye do / & ap∣ply euery thynge that ye done reuetētly to his honour. Beware of ydelnesse and lyght maners / and forgete not your enemyes of the contrary behalfe / whiche neuer re∣steth / but full besyly laboureth contynually to destroye your soules wt ryght great crafte & malyce. Haue them al
waye suspecte in euery thynge yt ye shall do and thynke. And beware yt he hyde hym not ymonge your good wer∣kes by vayne glory / for thou he wyll make them nought Somtyme he wyll brynge in good thughtes & purpo∣ses for an yll intent / for to lette a better thynge / or for to inquyete the conscyence. He cometh somtyme easely / som¦tyme feresely / somtyme pryuely / somtyme pertly. And ye more ye flee fro hym ye sorer he assayleth you. But what remedy? Truly we haue no strēgth nor polycy in regar∣de to our aduersary. Therfore let vs not trust in our self Our lorde let hym be our strengthe. Our good angelles and holy sayntes helpe & conforte to vs. Let vs therfore cōmytte our selfe to hym / & call for helpe betymes in eue¦ry temptacyon. Cleue stydfastly to his loue / with fere of his dyspleasure. Remembrynge what peyne he suffered to brynge man into the state of grace. And therfore suffer not to be brought oue therof for a lytell short pleasure or for sufferȳge a lytell dyspleasure or a short peyne. It ple∣seth god very moche / whan ony persone auoydeth temp¦tacyon betymes / and falleth to prayer and praysynge of god. For than ye thynge yt the deuyll had forged for man∣nes great hurte / it tourned vpon his owne heed wt cōfu∣syon. And ye persone yt so resysteth / shall haue double re∣warde / bothe for his vyctory & for his prayer vnto god. ¶ How to ouercome temptacyon. IF he be very ferce agaynst you wt tēptacyon or trybulacōn / how soeuer greuous it be / dyspere not. Thynke there ben. xii. dyuers houres in ye daye / they shall not be alyke vnto you. Some good and some badde. Thynke how oure lorde loketh vp¦on you to proue youre stydfastnesse & manlynesse / for to
gyye you the larger crowne of glory / and saye with To∣be. Yf we haue not taken good thynges of the hande of god / why sholde we not take yll. And remembre holy sa∣yntes that haue bē troubled so before. And marke it wel that whome soeuer god wyll vysyte with grace and con¦solacyons / hym wyll he fyrste proue in the fyre of trybu∣lacyon. Therfore neuer gyue vp to youre aduersary / ne grutche not with the troubleous temptacyons / nor loke tomoche of that that is layde to you by temptacyon / but go forwarde aboute youre good besynesse / as thoughe ye dysdeyned to here of suche thynges. Or els speke thus in your mynde / refourmynge your soule. Lo my soule / lo how ye deuyll knocketh at thy gate. Yf thou sufferest hym to come in / god thy strength shall go from the / and thou shalt perysshe with great mysery and suffer great peyne and shame before god and man. O thou frayle bo¦dy / all this wyckednesse procedeth of the. Beware thou be not subiecte vnto the deuyll. Consyder how that god is present / to se how thou shalt fyght with thyne enemy Cry for helpe vnto heuen / that they maye assyste vs and put awaye our aduersaryes. Thou can not se them / and therfore the batayll is the more peryllous. Suffer and take vpon the a lytell peyne / and thynke how pleasaunt thy vyctory shalbe. And contrary yf thou folowe ye short pleasure of thy temptacyon / eternall peyne wyll folowe. Therfore beware / & thā fall to prayer / & what soeuer ye deuyll speketh in you by tēptacyon / thȳke it is not your worde nor youre doynge / therfore care not for it / but go forwarde / trustȳge that as after great stormes / cometh fayre weder. Soo after great trybulacyon shall folowe ghostly consolacyon.
¶ How study or medytacyon in holy wrytynge profyteth moche agaynst temptacyon. FOr this cause I wolde ye sholde alwaye fere trustynge nothȳge vpon your owne strēgth but alwaye suspecte your owne fraylte / and as a donne that fereth the hawke dothe co∣munely vse the ryuer syde / and as ī a glasse doth spy in ye water ye shadowe of the hawke flyenge for to deuoure her / and so is aware of her & saueth her selfe. So I wolde ye sholde do. The ryuers or waters ben the sentences of holy scrypture / ye lyfe of our sauyour Ihesu cryst / & of other holy sayntes. Whiche flowynge fro the moost clere fountayne of the dyuyne wysedome dothe shewe & dyscouer ye subtyll crafte & fals suggestyō of our enemy the deuyll / & techeth vs how we shalbe ware of hym / for to escape his daunger. Nothynge swageth cō∣cupyscence more / nothȳge putteth yll thoughtes awaye better / than with the study or medytacyon of ye worde of god & holy redynge. Vnto ye whiche I wolde yt ye sholde so accustome your mȳde and occupy your hartes so ther upon / that whan ye go to bedde ye myght fall on slepe in the thynkynge of some sentence of holy scryptures or sa∣yntes lyues & dreame of them in your slepe yt assoone as ye shall wake / they maye cleue to youre memory. And therfore whan ye be troubled or waked by the crafte or yllusyon of youre enemy / beware of vayne thoughtes be tymes / auoydynge all dulnesse of body and mynde. And occupy you thus orels in prayers. ¶ Of mekenesse.
TAke this for a sure conclusyon / though chastyte be the very floure and beaute of all vertues / yet without the groūde of mekenesse it can not growe / but it fadeth and vanyssheth away / as showe agaynst the sonne. Mekenes is the fundacyon of all vertues / ye strengthe of the soule / the cōfusyon of our great enemy the deuyll / a vessell of all grace / the moder of peas / the restynge place of the holy ghost. And pryde contrary wyse is begynnynge of all synne & moost weke¦nes of the soule / whiche expelled angell frome heuē / and man from paradyse. Yf ye ioye in ony thynge / ioye in our lorde / & not for that ye come of noble vertuous lyguage or of ryche parentes / nor for that ye preferre pouerte be∣fore ryches / nor for that ye haue forsaken ryche marya∣ges / but shewe by mekenes how nere you ben our meke spouse Cryste / the more meke / the more nere hym ye bē. Beware that ye ben not proude of mekenes / but dyspyse your selfe / dyspyse none other persone. And set noughte to be dyspysed / but rather be glad. Yf ye wyll be ye spouse of Cryste / whiche beynge moost ryche in heuen / chose to be moost poore in erthe. He chose a poore moder / a poore house to be borne in / where he was moost honoured in heuē. He came hyder to take dyspytes / reproues / & great peynes mekely as a lambe. Therfore folowe this lambe as ye haue knowen other vyrgynes do before where so∣euer ye go. And thynke that ye can neuer be to meke / cō∣syderynge what grace cometh alwaye therby. ¶ Of obedyence. IF ye haue true mekenesse / ye shall repute euery persone your better / & youre selfe as a seruaūte
or a hande mayde / whatsoeuer degre ye be of. Wherup∣on folowe perfyte obedyence / whiche vneth god to man / & mā to god in perfyte charyte. Saynt Barnarde sayth Yf ye wyll be wyse / be obedyent. For thus it is wrytē. Yf thou coueytest wysedome / obserue and do that is com∣maunded the / and god shall gyue it the. This obedyence must be obserued (not ī seruyle fere) but with good affec∣cyon of loue & charyte (not for fere of peyne) but for loue of Iustyce. Obedyence is that vertue that graffeth all o∣ther vertues in ye soule. It presecueth and kepeth them surely after they ben graffed. It is better than sacryfyce For by sacryfyce is gyuen away the temporall goodes / and by obedyence is vtterly lefte and forsaken the owne selfe wyll. Of our owne wyll cometh all synne. Than yf we forsake our owne wyll / resygnynge it to god and to our superyoure / we forsake all synne / for we may do no∣thynge but as they wyll. Yf they wyll no synne / we ther¦fore beynge obedyent / maye do no synne. What is than more expedyent thā to haue obedyence (whiche hadde) we nede to fere no peynes of hell. The order of obedyēce is thus. It is more our duty to obey god than man / the superyour than the inferyour / better to obey your owne heed than a straunger. And it is specyally good to obey one to another / yf it letteth not the obedyence to the su∣peryour. A true obedyēcer is gladde to be seruyseable vn to euery one of his company / & sory to be chargeable or comberous to them. Louynge & gentyll to all / & deuoute vnto god. The greater that persone be that is dysobeyed the greuoser is the inobedyence. The more easy the com¦maundement be / the more greuoser is the contempte. And yf it fortune you to contempne the cōmaundement (as god forbydde) of youre heed / beware in ony wyse ye
contempne not the remedy / whiche is meke penaunce / redy to be sory with submyttynge of your self to correccy¦on / fallynge to the fete of them whome ye offende. Note well this sayenge of saynt Barnarde. Whan my supery¦our (sythen he) cōmaūdeth me to scylēce / yf a worde per¦chaunce escape thrughe neclygence or forgetynge my selfe. I knowlege my selfe gylte of inobedyēce venyally / but yf wyttyngly & with delyberacyon of a contempte / I breke out into wordes / wylfully brekynge the lawe of sylence. I dyscerne and Iudge my selfe a greuous syn∣ner / & that deedly and dampnably / yf I perceyuer inpe∣nytent vnto my lyues ende. For Cryste sayth to them ye bē rulers. Who that dyspyseth you / dyspyseth me. Ther∣fore kepe wel this vertue of obedyence vnto god / & your superyour / and god shalbe obedyent vnto your prayers and petycyons. And be alwaye redy to obey with a good wyll without ony taryenge or delay / yt ye may saye this verse truely. Paratū cor meuz deus: paratū cor¦meū. &c. My harte is redy good lorde / my harte is re∣dy to obey in wyll and dede. ¶ Of this vertue of pacyence. WHan ye ben troubled with iniuryes / repro∣ues / sclaūders / with enuye / or malyce a∣gaynst you / with losse of goodes / or aduer∣syte and sekenesse. Remembre your selfe be tymes / before ony passyon of heuynesse or inpacyence ryseth in you / thynkynge they bē the messan∣gers of your spouse Ihesu Cryste sende for your welthe / other to refourme your maners / or to proue your loue / whyder it be stedfast and faythfull or not. And not onely
suffer them pacyently / but also gladly / as saynt Poule dyd and many other holy men and women before / & con∣syder it is but foly and vayne to loke for heuen with plea¦sure and delytes / seynge that Cryste our souerayne lorde and spouse ascended not to heuen / but by manly fyght / with great peyne & passyon. And that it were no ryghte nor semynge / that the seruaunt sholde stande in better condycyon thā his mayster. Better it is to take pacyent¦ly / that thynge yt ye can not auoyde with hope of a good rewarde / thā to grutche wt suerte of great punysshemēt And byleue it truely that your aduersary can not do you so moche good / by no fauour / seruyce or benefyte / as he dothe whan he troubleth you / yf ye take it pacyently / wtout grutche or malyce agaynst hym. And thanke god therof / as for a token of great loue. Ye wyll aske me who can do thus. I answere? Euery persone that is in ye state of grace / and wyll apply hym selfe therto dylygently / as I suppose truly. Cryste suffered dethe for vs / leuynge to vs exemple (not onely hym selfe) but also many holy sa∣yntes / that by theyr exemple we sholde folowe theyr step¦pes. Exemple we haue of saynt Katheryne of Seene be¦ynge a chylde. Whan her fader and moder / bredren & sy∣stren were sette all to do her dyspleasure / & to trouble her holy mynde / from her ghostly purpose / she ordred & dys∣posed in her deuoute ymagynacyon / to accepte her fader as Cryste / her moder as our lady / her dredren & systren as ye apostles. And whatsoeuer was sayde or done to her by them / she toke it as it had ben done of Cryste / of his moder / or of his apostles / With meke pacyence / gladde obedyence / and louely obseruaūce / thrughe the whiche / she deserued increace of moche grace. Our lorde also byd¦deth vs to do good to them that hatē vs / and promyseth
vs the kyngedome of heuen therfore. ¶ The conclusyon. WHan the daye is almoost paste / wherin ye haue tasted bothe swete and soure / yt is to saye / ye haue had somtyme trybulacyon & somtyme cōsolacyon / bothe spyrytually & tēporally. Thā tourne vnto your selfe / cal∣lynge to remembraūce wt dylygent serche / how ye haue expended yt daye in euery thynge yt ye haue done or lefte vndone / yt behoued you to haue do / or yt became you not to do / beynge sory for euery defaute / & bewayle all yt is yll. For thoughe in ye mornȳge ye purposed for to forsake all yll / and for to exercyse good werkes / yet often tymes whan ye remēbre your selfe well / ye shall fynde yt ye haue done many ylles / and fewe good thynges. Therfore in suche causes ordeyne and kepe a chapytre euery day for your selfe. Be rygoryous vpon youre owne defautes / & let nothȳge scape vncorrecte / yf ye wyll yt god shall spare you. Examyne how ye reason hath be obedyent vnto the feythe / & how she hathe occupyed her all day. Also how ye wyl hath be ruled by reason / & kepte ye rules of goddes cōmaūdementes / & whether she hath be to famylyer wt sensualyte. How ye syght / ye herynge / ye speche / wt euery cense & mēbre of ye body hath be occupyed euery houre of the day / & in what place. The ymagynacyon & memory wt what & wt whome they haue ben occupyed. Se whe∣ther the body haue be remysse and slowe in seruyce / wat¦chynge / study / or labour. Serche yf ye mouthe haue spo∣ken ony vayne / sturdy / or vnclenly wordes / yt sholde of∣fende other god or man. Or yf ye can fynde ony other ex∣cesse
agaynst good crysten maners. Than bowe downe your harte & body mekely / & praye god of forgyuenesse / submyttynge your selfe to his correccyon / & be gladde to take it in this lyfe / & to do wylfull penaunce. There ben iij. exercyses of ghostly helthe / whiche ben necessary for euer persone to vse dayly. The. i. is to knowe youre selfe a sȳner / & to be sory for your sȳnes. The. ij. is to purpose for to be ware of synne / & to forsake it for euermore. The iij. is for to intēde to be confessed of all your synnes / and do penaunce for the same. who soeuet before theyr slepe dothe these. iij. thynges / surely though it behapped (as god forbyd) yt he sholde dye sodeynly / yet there is hope of grace & saluacyon / thoughe he were in deedly synne. Af∣ter ye haue made thus recollacyon of your selfe / & gade∣red your defautes togyder / bynde thē in a būdell & caste thē in ye fyre of hell / that is remembrynge the peynes or∣deyned for them / beynge sory and in full purpose neuer to fall agayne. And be more sory for the offence of god / than for the dammage that sholde folowe therof to youre selfe. Than after your prayers sayd / dresse you towarde your bedde with moost honest maner / as thoughe Cryst your spouse were present. And whan ye be set in youre bedde / blesse you with the sygne of ye crosse / cōmyttynge your body and soule vnto youre spouse Cryste and to the kepynge of youre good angell. Than laye you downe re¦uerētly with your armes a crosse vpon youre breest. Be∣ware than dylygently of vayne thoughtes / and putte a∣waye vayne temptacyons quyckly. Remembre yt youre enemy the deuyll slepeth not / and how that god dothe se all your behauyour / bothe in mynde and without forth. Therfore vse clenly maner wt your selfe. And beware of carnall desyres. Tender not youre body tomoche wt softe
& warme lyenge. Satysfy not youre body in al that it de¦syreth (yf ye do) it shall put you in great ieopardy. Yf ye can not slepe shortly after ye ben layde / occupy your selfe in psalmes / orels vpon your beedes / and with thē dryue all fantysyes frome your mynde / excepte it be occupyed aboute holy thȳges / by good medytacyon. So fallynge on slepe as I haue sayde before. Thus after the nyghte be ronne vnto matyns tyme / than ryse cherely / and be∣gynne to occupy the daye agayne / after the counseyll be∣fore. And as youre rule dothe teche you and bynde you / that ye may lyue here soberly / mekely / & iustly in clennes of conscyence / & hereafter obteyne eternall lyfe / & ioye wt∣out ende / whiche our lorde Ihesu graunt vs. Amen.
