THE PRINCIPALL GROVNDS OF CHRISTIAN RELIGION. Briefely and plainly pro∣pounded by way of Question and Answere for the instructing of the younger sort. By that late and Worthy Diuine Mr. N. Byfeild. LONDON. Printed by I. L. for Ralph Rounthwaite, and are to be solde at his shop, at the signe of the Golden Lyon in Paules Church-yard. 1625.
Christian Reader. I Shall not neede to vse many words ei∣ther of commenda∣tion of this small Treatise, seeing the bare name of him that was the cheife Author therof, I suppose may be enough to obtaine sufficient esteeme for it, with those that haue knowne him, either by his learned writings, or powerfull Mini∣stery. Nor of Apologie for my selfe in aduenturing to cast this little mite into the Lords Treasury from him that hath beene able to giue such abundance in greater Volumes, seeing it pleased
him to commit vnto my care both this and other of his labours, earnestly desi∣ring that if there were any thing found among his writings, that might bee thought profitable for the publike good, I should vse my best endeauour to haue it published; I haue therefore thought it my duty to the liuing if not to the dead, that the end aymed at by him might not be frustrated: Some of his workes haue beene published since his death, and more haue beene long since ready for the Presse; which I hope shall ere long come forth. I know it was the Authors purpose to haue made a more compleate and exact Catechisme if the Lord had prolonged his life; but he ha∣uing finished his allotted taske, God tooke him home to rest from all his la∣bours; howeuer it was his desire in the meane time to publish these short grounds, for the benefit of the younger sort, which are very briefely propoun∣ded for the helpe of memory, and
most easie and plaine for vnderstan∣ding of the most simple; and yet if wee marke them, wee may perceiue very much matter comprehended in a few words. It comes vnto thine hands en∣tire for the most part as it was left by him, very little being added or altered; the whole frame I haue cast into a short Table at the beginning, to the end the learner may first see and learne the whole methode and substance in a few words; as also I haue set downe the substance (at least) of those speciall proofes that confirme these Principles; to the end thou may∣est saue thy labour for searching the places of Scripture quoted, as also that such as learne the Answeres, they may by degrees learne also, and know the words of the chiefe proofes; for by this meanes they may profit more soundly, when their faith shall bee grounded not vpon the weake founda∣tion of humane Authoritie; but vp∣on
the most perfect and sure words of God; learne them therefore diligently, and the Lord giue thee vnderstanding in all things. Farewell: thine in the Lord, W. C.
