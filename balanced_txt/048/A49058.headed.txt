arms arms By the Mayor. WHereas by oft and sad experience I find that the great and holy name of God in the breach of the Sabbath is much prophaned, and the Gospel of Christ highly scandalized by multi∣tudes of loose, vaine and idle persons, who walk in More-fields and the fields neere unto it, in a wandring and idle manner, and oft times resort to the tipling houses thereabouts, on the Sabbath day, to the high dishonour and provocation of Almighty God: the breach of many good Lawes, and oft times of the Peace and good Government of this City and places adjacent, and considering it to be my duty to God and the soules of such poore creatures, to doe my uttermost in preventing so many great Evils as are conceived in and brought forth from such a wombe of sin as this is, which seemes to mee to be the Divels nest wherein he sitteth and hatches a succession of loose and carnall families, seasoning youth with such a wicked liberty that when they come to be heads of families, they and their families walk in the same paths, as if the keeping of a Sabbath to the Lord were no more but to lend the eare for a little time to the sound of the Gospel, and presently after to tempt the tempter by various objects, with vaine and sinfull Company and converse, to steale the good word of God out of their hearts and heads. These are therefore in the name of his Highness the Lord Protector of the Common-wealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, and the dominions thereto belonging, to will and require you to keepe or cause to be kept a good and sufficient watch on eve∣ry Sabbath day, at every gate and passage in your Ward that leads to the places aforesaid, and the same gates both great and small to keep shut and not to suffer any to go out thereat from this City, without giving a good account of the necessary occasions thereof to the Constable, who is hereby required to attend and doe his duty accordingly, and the Supervisors in their respective places, are hereby desired some of them each Sabbath day to see to the due observation hereof, and in speciall in the afternoones, and that no young or loose Persons be admitted to goe out of the City aforesaid, except upon manifest and necessa∣ry occasions, and indeed that no person be admitted except the work they goe about shall be found to be agreeable to the holy observance of the Sabbath day; And that this watch be kept every Sabbath untill sunset: And the Ministers of every Parish and Congregation within London and the liberties thereof, are hereby desired to a frequent exhortation and direction of their people unto a strict and due keeping holy of the Sabbath day, and that all heads of families and Parents of children be enjoyned according to the Lawes of God and man to keepe in their Children and servants from such wandrings on the dayes afore∣said, and be exhorted to unprove that whole day to the benefit of the soules of themselves and families, kee∣ping themselves and families retyred in their own houses, and there endeavour to fixe upon their hearts by meditation and repetition, what they have received from the Lord in his word preached, and to bedew that good seed with the prayers of faith, that so it may by a blessing from heaven bring forth an hun∣dred fold, to Gods glory and the advantage of their precious and eternall soules, Against all which the Divell is a grand and subtill enemy, and therefore tempts and drawes to the former loose Conversation on that blessed day for soule-advantage. And if any Parent, Master or Mistris shall have cause to com∣plaine that after good example and exhortation accompanied with commands, they cannot keepe their Children and Servants to a due obedience of the Lawes before expressed, they are hereby required to bring all such offenders before mee or some other of the Iustices of the peace within this City of London, where they shall be dealt withall according to their merits and the due course of Law. And it is hereby requi∣red that the same care be taken to prevent the streets and lanes of this City from all manner of profana∣tion of the Sabbath day, and to these ends the Ministers of each Parish are enjoyned some one Sabbath day before the first of May next, to read in their Publick Congregations, the Lawes to that purpose herewith sent them, and at such other times as they may judge meet, and all Persons who by Law or Conscience are obliged to see the due observation of this Precept, are hereby required to do their duties herein. Dated the 18 of March, 1656. Printed by James Flesher, Printer to the Honorable City of London.
