London's Glory OR, THE HISTORY Of the Famous and Valiant London Prentice: Being an Account of his Parentage, Birth and Breeding, together wi many brave and Heroick Exploits perform'd by him throughout the Course of his Life; to the Honour of London, and the whole  Nation. London: Printed by .
LONDON's GLORY, &c. Chap I. Of the Birth and Parentage of Aurelius, the valiant London 'Prentice; how he encountred a Serpent in his Cradle; and growing up, did the like with a Bear that met him in his way. ENgland has been behind-hand with no Nation, in gi∣ving Birth to gallant Men, who, by their Valour and great Actions, have spread her Fame in every corner of the Universe, making her beloved of her Friends, and fea∣red by her Enemies: I need not here mention the renowned King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, the baave Tom of Lincoln, the ever-famous Guy of Warwick, nor the valiant Knights Templers, who warred against Infidels in the Holy Land, to establish the Christian Faith at the expence of their Blood, doing Wonders in Armes, which shall preserve their Names as long as Time shall last, since I am to treat of one whom Fortune made her Darling, and Fame has crown'd to all Posterity with lasting Wreaths of Lawrel. To be brief then, In the Beign of the renowned Queen Elizabeth, who confirmed the Protestant Religion, upheld the then sinking State of the Dutch Nation, made Rome and Spain to tremble at her Frowns; in the famous County Palatinate of Chester, commonly call'd Cheshire, lived a Man descended from anci∣ent British Blood, who marrying a vertuous Wise, was bles∣sed with a Son, of whose Fame all England has rung; nor has it been bounded here, but passing the narrow Limits of this Isle filled distant Lands with Admiration. In his Baptism they named him Aurelius, in memory of a British Prince of that Name, who, in the defence of his Country against the in∣vading Romans, did Wonders, overthrowing divers Roman Lieutenants, and destroying multitudes of their legionary Sol∣diers, this Child, like Hercules, in his Cradle began to shew
his promising Strength, & what great things in time he would do, when he matured his Strength: A huge Snake that lay lurking in a hole of the House, and used to lap the Milk in the Dairy, drawn by the warmth of the Insant to the Cradle, reared his dreadful Head to gorge himself with innocent Blood, whilst the sleepv Nurse was hanging her Head over the Fire, and neglected her tender Charge: young Aurelius, undaunted, beheld this dreadful sight, and smiled, which would have sca∣red another Infant into Fits, and with his hands beat the Snake back as oft as it assailed him, till with the violent motion the Cradle overturn'd, the noise of which waked the Nurse, who suddenly turned it up, found the Infant struggling with the Snake grasped in his hand; but fearful at the sight, instead of disengaging them, she set up such a loud throat, as made the Men that were inning their Harvest, come running with Prongs, who seeing what was the cause of her yelling, took courage, and drew away the Snake, whilst the Nurse fell into a Swound, and much a do they had to recover her; the Infant all this while lay smiling though bit by the Arm, that the blood trickled from the Wound. This Passage being told a∣broad, a grave Divine came to see this Child, and being well skill'd in Astrology, kissed him, and told his Parents, That from this he foresaw that their Son should be great, do things, tho' dangerous in the Attempt, that should make him known to the World's end. This did not a little comfort them, and put them out of the fright they were in, lest the poisonous wound might bereave them of a Blessing, in which, next to Heaven, they placed their Happiness, & so with the use of Walwort, Pol∣tises of Rue and Plantaine, they cured it; the Wound being healed, & the danger over, they more rejoyced in their hopeful Issue; and as he grew up, his Beauty increased so, that the Virgins strove who should dandle him most, and get the most Kisses for their Labour. When he grew up, his Parents took care to breed him up in Learning; among the School-boys he took so much delight to try his Strength, mastering those that were much older that himself; he delighted himself with the thoughts of noble Actions, becoming grave and serious, much
above his Years, yet in publick Pastimes he would be behind none. He grew so expert in Wrestling at twelve Years old, that he would encounter with lubberly Fellows, and throw them to admiration; at Cudgels, throwing the Bar, and ma∣ny other youthful Exercises, he won much Praise; in shooting at the Long-bow, he might well be compared to Robin Hood, who rarely missed his Mark; and, to be brief, a hopefuller Youth was not found in the West. When he had learned as far as his Master could teach him, he was sent home with great commendations, and often went with his Father to Fairs and Wakes to understand Company, and (as the Country-men call it) learn Behaviour, and in all Places his Discourse was so taking, that he parted not without regret: He soon learned skill in Buying and Selling, so that his Father soon trusted him to bargain and sell, in which he was so cunning, that he brought him great Advantage: One day coming home from Market, a Bear, that had been baited, broke loose and scattered both the Dogs and People, so that none durst venture to stay her; she came directly in his way, and the People that followed at a distance, cried out to him to get up a Tree to shun her Fury; but he scorning to stoop to base Fear, alighted from his Horse, stood full in the way; the furious Beast to make her Passage clear, rose an end, and clasped him in her Paws, thinking to have overthrown him; but with his strong Arms (being not eighteen years of Age) he girded her so-hard that she roared horribly, and immediately throwing her, they reeled over each other for some time, but at length catching hold of her Nose with his Teeth, a dangerous, tho' successful Adventure, she roared horribly, turned on her Back, and yielded to the Con∣queror. By this time the People were come up in Crouds, thinking he had been slain, but, to their amazement, found he had only got some slight cratches, and a little bite on his shoulder; then taking the Muzzle out of one of their Hands, he put it on, and so led her to the Place from whence she came.
Chap II. How many sair Virgins fell in Love with him, and among others, Lucinda, a wealthy Herdsman's Daughter; how her Sweethearts discovering it, lay in wait to be revenged on him &c. THe things that had been done by Aurelius thus early, got him great Repute among the young Maidens of the Country, his Beauty conspiring with the Proportion of his Body to inflame their Hearts, so that many a Virgin long'd to have him her own, and grew Love-sick for him, which ap∣peared by their languishing Eyes, Sighs and Blushes, more than their Tongues, being restrained by Modesty, durst pro∣claim; among others a beautiful Damsel named Lucinda, who was courted and admired by many amorous Youths, fixed her Affection on him; it's true, she was not of noble Parentage, as most commonly Historians boast their Female-lovers to be, but her honest Parents lived by keeping and selling Cattle, Dary∣ing, and such like Rural Affairs, and by their Industry were very Wealthy: This young Virgin infinitely doated on Aurelius; Love tormented her with his burning Flames, and in vain she strugled to extinguish the sacred Fire; for, not being past her first Blushes, Modesty and Bashfulness, locked up her Tongue from making known what she so much desired, and all her Language in that Affair, was Sighs, Blushes and Glances; but Aurelius, whom Fame prompted to great things, did not, nor would not interpret that silent Talk of Lovers; yet she would not stick to praise his comely Features and manly Limbs to the rest of her Lovers; which made them conclude some other had taken up the room of her Heart they so earnestly laboured to possess; they used all means possible to find out who this Adonis should be, that could charm so fair a Venus, and make her sigh for him, whilst they, who highly valued themselves, must sigh for a Smile in vain. They long suspe∣cted, but not certain, till an unlucky Accident discovered all: The fair Virgin saw she could not force her Tongue to disclose her Love thought with her self, it was better to break her
of Cupid's Tyranny; A Letter, says she, will not blush though I must almost to Death, to tell that I intrust the Paper with; and so resolving and unresolving, for a time, at last she resolved to write, and did so in these Words: Dear Aurelius, Pardon me in your Censure for this Boldness, and spare the Blushes of a Love-sick Maid, when she tells you, constrained by no common Passi∣on, she loves you; & without a suitable Return, must be ever misera∣ble: I have slighted for your sake many that pretend to admire me, and fill my Ears with Praises of my Beauty; but whether in this they flatter me or not, the proof will lie in your Judgment: If I am scorned and slighted by you, I must unavoidably remain your disconsolate Lucinda. This Letter she delivered to a Confi∣dent to carry it to Aurelius; she dropt it, and one of her Lo∣vers coming to pay her a Visit, found it, and read it, to his no small Grief, and soon communicared it to the rest of her Sweet∣hearts, resolving to make this slight Affront a common Cause, and so unite in Revenge against this Troubler of their Repose. Upon this, all of them being heartily vexed, that one whom they accounted a Boy, should steal a Heart they had laboured to possess with great expence in Gifts and Treats; and in the end, concluded she was taken more with his fair Countenance than Fortune, they came to this wicked Resolve, which was to way lay him as he came from Market, and deform him, by Wounds, and then they doubted not but the Object of her Af∣fection would be removed, and she would as much detest him as ever she had lov'd him: In order to this Villany, they ar∣med themselves with Swords and Daggars, hid themselves by the side of a Wood, nor had they lain long in Ambush, but, as they wished, he came along, singing merrily this Song: Love is folly, Melancholy does on it attend; Venus Tents I do despise, Mars alone can me suffice, where Fame does crown the end, &c. Our gallant Youth being come to the place where the Ambush was laid, was not a little surprized to see four
armed, supposing them to be Robbers, but by their Re∣proaches; saying, Now, Villain! we complement you in Lu∣cinda's Name, whom thou hast basely enchanted with Love-powder, to withdraw her Affections from us, and place them on thy self, who art not worthy of her Smiles; he was of another opinion, and would have replied to vindicate himself, by protesting his Innocency of what they charged him with; but their blind Rage, and Love-fury would not give him leave to do it, but rushing on him they gave him many stroaks, which raised his Anger, so that (being weaponless) with his strong Arms he seized two of the forwardest of them, and grasping them fast by the Collars, brought their Heads together with such vio∣lence, that their Eyes seemed to flash Fire, and reeling, at last they fell to the ground, unable to rise for a time; then taking away one of their Swords, he fell on with such fury that they concluded him endued with more than Humane Force; so that fainting with loss of Blood, they fell on their Knees and begged Mercy, intreating him to save their Lives, and they would tell him all that mov'd them to this rash At∣tempt; upon this he bid them disarm, which they readily did, and made a full Confession, how they design'd to have hand∣led him if they had overcome him: Nay, says he, then if you were so hot for Mischief without a Cause, it's time to cool you; whereupon he made them unstrip, and drove them into a Wood before him, like timerous Deer, and with their Garters bound them naked to seueral Trees, laying every one his Cloaths by him; then pulling out his Pen and Ink, he wrote these Lines, and fixed them on the Tree above the Head of the first: These valiant Heroes one poor Man assail'd, But unarm'd, over them all prevail'd; Hot Love it seems made them so daring bold, Therefore he thought fit thus they should be cool'd. This done, he went home and said nothing to any body of the Matter; but they having staid in the Wood, and the next day unbound by the Wood-men, they dropt such words, that, together with the lines affixed, discovered their Disgrace, and
the cause they had been so treated; which flying abroad in the Villages, it was soon known who had thus handled them; so that they were jeered by every one; and fair Lucinda greatly rejoyced for two Causes: First, That her Lover had escaped the Danger. And, secondly, by this means he could not be ig∣norant of the Love she bore him. Chap. III. How Aurelius was sent to London, put Apprentice to a Turky Merchant, fell in Love with Dorinda his Master's Danghter, but being slighted by her, got leave to sail for Turky. THis Adventure got Aurelius much Praise; but he little re∣garded the Love of the fond Maid, which made her fall sick, and her Friends fearing to lose, by this means, their dar∣ling Daughter, came to treat with his Friends about a Marri∣age, offering a large Portion; but his Years not much suiting with Love, they finding him averse, his Parents did not much urge it to him; however, Lucinda, by the help of able Physi∣cians recovered, and with her health her Love abated; so that growing more and more indifferent, a lusty Youth, courting her closely, at the importunity of her Parents, she was marri∣ed; which greatly rejoyced Aurelius, who feared she might have done some mischief to herself for being neglected by him, which would have redounded to his disgrace; however, his Parents fearing the Rivals whom he treated as mentioned, might meditate Revenge, and do him some Injury, they con∣cluded to send him to London, and put him to some Calling that might enable him to live in Wealth and Credit; and commu∣nicating it to him, bid him pitch upon what he thought fit; and having an Itch for Travelling, he chose to be a Merchant; and soon one was found, who traded to Turkey; with him he was plac'd, soon gaining the esteem of the whole Family, by his courteous Behaviour. I should have told you in his way to London, he fought with and took two High-way-men that set upon him to have robbed him, for which, the County in which he did this brave Exploite, rewarded him with an im∣broidered Belt, and a well temper'd Sword, which afterward
upon occasion, he used with success, as will appear in the se∣quel of this History. When he had served about three Years of his time, having gained much Fame by playing several Prizes, and worsting the experiene'd Masters of Delence; he grew so in love with Arms, that nothing charmed him more than the sound of the Trumpet, or ratling of the Drum: In exercising the Pike and Musquet, he took a singular delight, exceeding. in it all the City; but whilst he followed these Practices, and every-where gained Applause, the powerful God of Love, whom he always thought to have baffled, stormed his courageous Heart, and got strong Possession in it; his Master had only one Daughter, who till this time was kept from his sight at a Boarding-school, where having acquired many Accomplishments to add a seemly Grace to her Beauty, so lovely & charming she was, in all Parts, that the first sight of her inflamed him; and now knowing what it was to be in Love and the Torments that attend it, he bla∣med himself for stopping his ears to Lucinda; he tryed by all obliging Actions he could to make fair Dorinda (for so she was called) understand his good meaning to her; but she not ex∣ceeding fourteen, though proper of her Age, through Igno∣rance of what Love meant, took his civility as a duty and re∣spect towards her, being his Master's Daughter, and conclu∣ded it no more than his Duty, though he made her several Pre∣sents; and when he waited at the Table, his Eyes were always fixed on her, his sleep went from him, and he frequently dreamed, he add ressed himself to her in studied Eloquence and Courtship, but she refused his Love, frowned on him, and when he went to grasp her, slid away like à Shadow from his Arms. These he took as bad Omens; yet at length summon∣ing his courage after long deliberation, he resolved to write his Mind and lay it on her Dressing box, that she should not miss to find the Letter; and accordingly he wrote in these Words: Lovely Dorinda, YOur Beauty, fair as the new born Light, has captivated the Heart of your poor Servant, and entangled him in the Fetters
of Love; therefore humbly prostrating my self at your feet, I beg Compassion at your Hands: The Inequality indeed may make you check my Presumption; but consider Love that takes the Diadem from Queens, and makes them condescend to match with those of an humble Strain, pleading on my fide, may make you compassionate towards him that can only live by your Smiles, and without your Favours must be miserable. Aurelius. This fell into her Hands as he wish'd, and she read it with much surprize, mixed with anger and disdain; then tore it, saying, What, has my Facher bestowed so much in breeding on me, and dares his Man, who came a Country Clown yesterday, presume impudently to tell me he loves me, who am my Father's only Heir, a Match for a Lord, and may glitter in the Court amongst the prou∣dest Ladies? No, no, this must not be suffered, I'll nip his sawcy Love in the Bud, and make him know his Distance. This said, she flung down Stairs, and finding him in the Counting-house by himself, she said, How now, Aurelius, what made you so bold as to intrude into my Closet, and leave a Letter there? I think you did more than good Manners will bear you out in: But let we bear no more of you, for if I do, you may have such cause to repent it, that you little wish for. Thunder struck at this sharp and un∣expected Repremand, whilst he laboured to force suitable words for a Reply and Excuse, she gave him not time, but for∣cing frowns on her Brow, she flung away in a Pet. This greatly vexed him, and made him repent him, but at length resolving to struggle with the Flame, and not speak of Love to her, for fear of offending till he found a more favou∣rable opportunity; he at that time only continued a duteous respect towards her, trying all manner of ways by his Service to oblige her, yet found her Countenance estranged from him; and indeed her Father being vastly Rich, that, and the Fame of her unparellel'd Beauty, soon brought a great many young Lords and Knights to court her; this killing sight tor∣mented our Lover more than her disdain before had done, as now concluding he should lose the beauteous Object of his Wi∣shes
and Desires, and therefore that absence, as he sancied might mitigate if not cure the violent Feever, Love tortured him withal, he took an opportunity when he found his Master in a good humour to desire one request of him, What is it, said the Merchant, if it be reasonable it shall not be deny'd you? On∣ly Sir, said be, that to improve my Understanding in Merchan∣dize, I may with your good leave go aboard and manage your Affairs beyond the Seas, in the nature of your Factor. Well mention'd, said the Merchant, I was thinking of this my self, and thought to ask you, how you stood inclined that way; but seeing you have freely offered it on your own accord, I am the better pleased, and shall conclude you will be more diligent about my business, for thero is nothing like a willing mind, and the next Fleet that sets sail, I will provide all things necessary for your Voyage to Constantinople in Turky, the largest City in the World; for the Vactor I employed there is lately dead. Aurelius very well pleased at this, thanked his Master, and promised in every thing he could to do the best, and faithfully to serve him. Chap. IV. How Aurelius took leave of the Family, and left a Paper and Token for his unkind Mistress; how sailing the Seas, he had a dreadful Fight with Algier and Sally Pirates, the Won∣ders he did therein, and safely arrived at Constantinople; his Reception and Welcome there by the Factors; how he slew a Ty∣gar, and rescued the Sultan's Daughter, &c. EArly in the spring, when the Seas where freed from the rage of boisterous Winds, Mr.Tradewell, the Merchant fit∣ted out three Ships of his own riehly laden, which in company of divers others prepared to set fail; when the Maid-servants heard that Aurelius was to go and leave them, they wept for sorrow, for they loved and valued him at a high rate; how∣ever at parting he treated them with Wine and Sweet-meats, and left with one of them these lines, with a Jewel sealed up, to deliver to fair Dorinda, but with charge not to do it, till she heard the Ship was put to Sea.
Lovely, but cruel Maid, too too unkind, 'Tis you that force me to the Sea and Wind; Yet I must blame my self, and needs confess, In me was found too much Ʋnworthiness So rare a Prize to gain, I aim'd too high, Like those I am punish'd that wou'd storm the Sky: Yet pardon me, though you will not be kind; That I must bear your Image in my Mind. That lovely Form, Time never can deface, Which Infant-love, first in my Heart did place; Then be so kind when you this Jewel see, In pitty, to vouchsafe to think on me. The Fleet sailed with a prosperous Gail, till they came with∣in ten Leagues of Gibralter, on the Spanish side, and then a Storm arising they were tossed with uncertain Wind all Night, and next Morning, to the great Terror of most, they stood in with five Algerine and Sally Men of War; so that many began to cryout, they were utterly undone; some were for running a snoar into the first Bay or Creek, though to a certain ha∣zard of their Lives upon those unmountable Rocks and Shoars; others for putting off in the Long boats and leaving the Ships and Goods a Prey to the Pirates, that so they might escape Slavery; in this Consternation, they came up board and board, the Admiral of Algire biding them strike and yield, or else to expect no quarter; to this proud language of the Turks Aurelius being on the Deck, with his Sword in his Hand, an∣lwered, The Ships were laden with his Master's Goods, of which he had a charge, and that they were English Men on board, who did not use to be out blustered or dared with Words; therefore if they expected any thing they must win it and wear it. Then turning to his drooping Companions, he said, Come, pull up couragious Hearts, and let us fight for the Ho∣nour of our Nation, fam'd for Valour, throughout the World; we have a stout Ship under us, and whilst she swims above Water, let it never be said we will quit it. By this time the bold assailing Turks eagerly strove to win the Mast of the Ship, in which the first that entred with one
mighty blow he struck his Head off, and down fell the Body with it into the Sea, to breakfast the Fish; this animated o∣thers, and all taking Arms, sought with prodigious fury; the great Guns in the mean while roared from either side, bellow∣ing Thunder and breathing Fire whilst Iron Globes pierced through and through the Waves, by their violence mounted, and by the shock grew tempestuous. Aurelius layed about him with such violent force, that he made Arms, Legs and Heads, fly at a dismal rate; so that the Turks swearing by Mahomet, he was a Devil, and no Man, but would have un∣grapled; which he perceiving, leaped on Board, and was se∣conded by others; hand to hand he slew the Admiral, which so dismaid the Turks, that they hoised all their Sails, but too late, for throwing prodigious Showers of Fire upon it, soon set their Tackle in a blaze, and the broad Waves shined with the light of the Flame: this Ship running foul on another set her on Fire, and a third coming up to relieve her Fellows, met with the same fate; a fourth sunk, which made the fitch run away with all the sail she could make, to deliver herself from the like ruin, and carry home the dismal News; some of the floating Turks they took up and saved, the rest perished by Wounds, Fire and Waves; and their Cries were heard half broiling in the Flame, like the Damned in Hell. The Prisoners they took, they stowed in the holds of the Ship; and lying by a few hours to repair the damage they had received in the Fight, they set sail, and with out any further Interruption passed the Streights, and Dardanellos sailing directly for Con∣stantinople. The Ships no sooner arrived in the Port, but the English Merchants and Factors came on board to welcome and con∣gratulate the safe Arrival of their Country men, and enquire of the welfare of their Friends in England; and great joy and feasting there was amonst them; they saluted the Port with their Guns, and were resaluted with as many; and going on Shoar, he took charge of his Master's Effects in the Ware-hou∣ses on the Key, and so prudently managed Matters, that he got Reputation, and large Commendations were carried back
to England of him: yet it moved not Dorinda's haughty Mind, who sacrifie'd her Love to Ambition; marrying into a noble Family, tho' she proved an unhappy Match, for her Husband being banished, for Conspiring against the Queen, and his E∣state seized, he compelled her to accompany him, to the great grief of her Parents. Aurelius being as is said, in Turky, got great Riches; and, when his leisure would permit, took his Pleasure in a Chalap on the shore of the black Sea, and other pleasant Floods that are in the Neighbour hood of that famous City; when landing by a Wood-side that descended from a Mountain, as he with some others were banquetting under a shady Palm-tree, and very merry, all on a sudden their Ears were saluted with a dismal Cry, which seem'd to proceed from Female Voices (and still drew nearer) upon which apprehending the approach of some Danger, they rise up, drew their Swords, and stood on their Gaurds, till they should see or know what the meaning of it was; when immediately two Ladies well mounted came riding, diging the bloody Rowels of their Spurs in their Hor∣ses sides, and seeing Company, redoubled their Cries for spee∣dy Help and Assistance to save their Lives. Aurelius who as yet saw nothing pursue them, thought they had been affright∣ed by some Phantom, or else distracted, but they were no sooner come up, nor had time to relate the cause of the Fear and Danger, but he beheld a monsterous Tygar coming after them at full Cry, as having the scent of them in the Wind; his Companions, who were only two young Factors and a Steers man, perswaded him as he loved his Life to hast aboard the Boat, take the Ladies with them, and leave the Horses a Prey to the ravenous Creature, seeing they could not convey them away in their Boat without Danger of Sinking, not be∣ing capable of holding them; but Aurelius not hearkning to this, bid them put the Ladies aboard, and those that wou'd might put off in it, and see the Combate safe from Danger for he was resolved to try his good Sword, to see if the Tygar's Skin was proof against it or not; Fear soon made them all take his Counsel, and now he is left alone on the Shoat to stand the brunt. The Tygar come at him with great Fury, think∣ing
at once to have devoured him, but his undaunted Courage bore him out, for the first blow he cut of one of his fore Legs, at which he howled horribly; yet made at him again, and, wounding him in the other, quickly sheath'd the Sword in his Belly, which made him loose his hold. and following that with a mighty blow he felled him and smote off his Head; his Companions in great fear beholding the Fight, now as much rejoyced to see him Vanquisher, whom they had given before for lost; his Friends embraced him, and the Ladies returned him a thousand thanks, owning the safety of their Lives had hap pened by his means; for this cruel Beast it seems ranging up and down the Country a long time, had destroyed many People and Cattle, being as big as ordinary an Horse; and so with the Head he returned to Constantinople, the Ladies quitting their Horses to go the safer way by Water, as fearing, in returning by Land, some other Danger might befal them; one of them turn∣ing aside her Vail, shewed her lovely Face and lilly Hand, pre∣senting Aurelius with a rich Diamond Ring, enquiring of his Country, Name and the cause of his being in Turkey, all which he briefly told her, the relation of which spun out the time till they landed; now this fair Lady was the Turkish Sultan's Daughter, who going in disguise with her Waiting-maid to take the Air privately, and retired from State-formality, fell into this Danger, which had not Fortune thrown as it were our valiant London 'Prentice in their way, had been fatal to them: And, as a further mark of her Favour, she afterward privately sent him a Vest of Cloth of Gold and Sable, and a Sword-handle, studed with Rubies and other precious Stones, biding him wear it for her sake, as a Rewaad for the good Ser∣vice he had done; but withal not to mention he had seen her, for that might be dangerous to him, if not reflect on her Ho∣nonr, for as much as she had stolen out Vailed, and none but her Confidents knew she was missing, intimating his Compa∣nions should be cautioned the like.
Chap. V. How the Prince of the Georgeans marryed the Sultan's Daughter, and how Aurelius Justing, overthrew three mighty Turks, and brake the Prince's Neck with a weighty stroke, for which he was dm'd to be devoured by two Lyons, which he slew, and gained his Liberty, and other matters. AƲrelius bringing the Tygar's Head to Constantinople, the Aga of the Janizaries sent for him, and demanded it of him a due to him, but withal gave him five hundred Aspers for the good service be had done in destroying so cruel a Beast; and then it was hung up in the Arsenal among the Heads of Bears, Lyons, Leopards, Panthers, and other wild Beasts slain in Hunting, for the Turks naturally love that Exercise, and seek Danger for Applause, tho' many of them come short home. During these Transactions, the Prince of the Georgeans, a vast Country lying in the Turkish Territories between Persia and Armenia, came to the Ottoman Port, and being highly entertained by the Sultan for aiding the Persians, and doing him many good Services on the Frontiers; he at length aspi∣red to court the beautiful Teozara, the Lady whom Aurelius had rescued; and the Sultan encouraging him in his Suit, for here the Daughters have not their own choosing, but are ab∣solutely at the disposal of their Fathers: He so prevailed, that the match was concluded, and great preparations made for the celebrating the Marriage. Rich Presents were sent from the Brdegroom to the Bride, and from her to him carried pub∣lickly through the Strets, for the People to behold, by Eu∣nuches, Pages, and the great Officers of the Court; and at length, in the stately Mosque of Sancta Sophia, formerly a Christian Church, the Musty or Mahomet's High-Priest, joy∣ned their Hands; and after great Feasting, for such a Wed∣ding usually lasts for ten or twenty Days, Martial Feats were appointed, in the nature of Justs, Tilts and Turnaments, and many gallant Men prepared to try their Prowess, and win Honour to the Nations that gave them ; this being known, inflamed Aurelius's Heart with a Thirst of Glory, and he resolved to make one amongst them; early in the Morning
the City was filled with Crouds, the Trumpets and Haut∣boys sounding and flourishing to give warning, that the Com∣batants might in due time prepare to be in a readiness; and the Janizaries were appointed to make and guard the List, whilst golden Pavilions were erected for the Sultan, Sultan∣ness, and others of the highest Rank. In the mean while Aurelius had suited himself with a fine suit of Armour, furnished with a silver Launce, and the trusty Sword that was given him in England, the Device of his Shield was a Phenix, representing the Virgin Queen he was born under, and the Ocean chained, signifying the English Ma∣sters of the Seas; and buying a strong Horse of Thracian breed he came prancing in to try his chance in the List; yet, seeing many forward, and being but a Stranger, and young, he gave way to them, thinking thereby to gain the greater Honour, to conquer those that had conquered others; at length, many being thrown out, three Turkish Bashaws of divers Nations were left. Conquerors, who proudly in the name of the Bride∣groom, challenged any that dare to enter: Aurelius seeing ma∣ny strange Courtiers, and none very forward, concluded this was his time to win Honour, and signalize himself at the Turkish Court; and pricking forward his foaming Steed, gal∣lantly entred. The first he encountered with, he struck full on the Breast with his Launce, and tumbled him with his Heels kicking upwards over the Crupper, so that the Earth shook with his heavy fall; and much on the same manner he served the other two, one at the first and the other at the second Course; upon which a mighty shout arose, and many wondred who this valiant Stranger should be: Some English, who was privy to this Enterprize, greatly rejoyced that their Country had bore the Honour from other Nations: The Prince of the Georgians was inwardly vexed to see his Champions thus baf∣fled, and no other attempting to enter the List in Vindication of his Honour, wherefore, with the leave of his Father-in-law the Sultan, he armed to vindicate his failed Men; nor could the Intreaties or Tears of his fair Bride, stay him from the En∣counter: Our Heroick English Youth, seeing him enter in
golden Armour, undauntedly prepare to run the Course; and they did it with such thundering speed, that the ground trem∣bled under their Horses feet, and with such strength and fury they met, that the ends of their Lances or Spears shivered in the Air; then passing on they turned again, the Prince drew his Sword, and came upon Aurelius e'er he had time to draw his; yet, having the weighty truncheon of his Spear in his hand, he met him at English Club law, and receiving a slight wound in the shoulder, he returned the stroke with his truncheon, charging it so forcible on the Poince's helmet behind, that he not only beat him from his Horse, but by the violent incli∣ning, his Neck broke, so that he was taken up dead. This greatly enraged the Turkish Sultan, insomuch that he swore by his Father's Scalp, and the Beard of Mahomet, that our Youth should dye the cruell'st Death that ever was invent∣ed for Men; causing him immediately to be unarmed, and brought before him, demanding who he was, and of what Na∣tion he was; he as undauntedly reply'd, He was a London Prentice, come over to manage his Master's Affairs, & had done this according to the rule of Justs and Law of Arms, in Honour of the Maiden Queen, to whom he was a Subject, and was ready to do more if permitted. The Turk amazed at his bold reply, turning to his Nobles, said, By Mahomet, if all the London 'Prentices be as stout as this, they are able to be at me out of my Empire: The German Armies, I have so often baffled, are but Pigmies to them. However, he order'd him to a Dungeon, where he lay three Days without any Food, only Rats and Mice which the Dun∣geon afforded; verily believing he was put there to starve to Death; in the mean while the English Merchants and Fa∣ctors did all they could to interceed for him, but the inexora∣ble Turk would hear nothing on his behalf. At the end of three Days, Aurelius over Night had notice to prepare himself for Death the next Morning; but was not ac∣quainted by what means he should die, expecting from his usuage nothing but Tortures and Torments: this brought in∣to his Mind, how St. George broke the Dungeon, and escaped the like Fate; he tryed to do it, but finding all the sides a hard
Rock, and the Entrance a mighty Iron Gate, wanting suitable Engins to force his way, he gave over his strugling, think∣ing next Morning to surprize the Keepers, when they came to take him out, and by wresting a Weapon, hew his Pas∣sage througo tem, and so escape to Sea; but then thinks he, I shall injre my Master, for all his Goods will be confiscated: whilst he was musing on these things, he heard the Bolts and Chains rattle, Ropes let down to draw him up, which he willingly embraced; and once more viewing Light, saw him∣self emcompassed with armed Men, who led him to the Amphi∣theatre, where he found the Sultan and great numbers placed round in Galleries to see his Tragedy. Two Lyons it seems were prepared, the fiercest and largest in the Den, who had been kept three Days without Meat, to make them more cruel and ravenous on their Prey: and that he should make the bet∣ter Figure, the Princess, whose tender Heart would not let her be present at so woful a sight, in token of her Love, sent him privately a Shirt of Cambrick, Drawers of white Sattin, em∣broidered with Gold, and a crimson Cap; when upon no∣tice from whose fair Hands they came, and being informed she was one of the Ladies he had delivered from the fury of the Tygar, he returned her the Ring she gave him, and desired when he was dead, she would condescend to keep him in her remembrance, and whilst alive, favour him with her good wishes; and so stripping, put on the things she had sent him, as a Token of her Love. This he had scarce done, when the Skies overcast with dis∣mal blackness, so that the Sun yielded but a feeble light, and soon after all Heaven thundered with a Storm, when immedi∣ately the doors of the two dreadful Dens were opened by Pul∣lies and Chains from above in the Galleries, and two huge Lyons, with fiery Eyes came running out roaring horribly, swinging their Tails about their sides, when casting their glaring Eyes on our undaunted Youth as their Prey, they came furioussy at him with open Mouths, thinking to rend him in pieces immediately & bury him in their hungry Maws; who resolving not to dye without some Tryal of Manhood,
stretched out his strong Arms, and as Fortune favoured and guided them, just as they made a furious leap, to seize him in their Paws, he thrust his Fists down their Throats with such Strength and Fury, that after long strugling, seizing their Hearts, pulled them out by main Strength; upon this, with a roar the two furious Beasts fell dead at his Feet and two pro∣digous claps of Thunder ensued; at this all the Spectators were much afrighted; but our undaunted Youth, demanded aloud if they had any more Lyons to send, he was ready to encounter them; and for the Honour of his Queen and Coun∣try, again expose his Life: But this valiant Act made the Sul∣tan conclude him more than mortal Man, and ordered he should immediately be set at liberty, and rich Rewards given to him. He afterwards offered to make him great in his Court, if he would be a Mahometan, but he refused it with disdain; and so being by his Valour freed from the Danger, he went to his business. Chap. VI. How the Turkish Princess fell in Love with Aureli∣us; for his sake turned Christian, and came to England with him with great store of Riches; of the Splendor of their Wed∣ding, and other memorable things worthy of note. AƲrelins thus having encreased his Fame and Renown; no sooner was the Funerals of the Georgian Prince over with great Solemnity, but the beauteous Teoraza began to contemplate his Beauty and manly Courage, and to fix her mind on him, and at length growing restless in her Love, not knowing, for blushes how to discover it, she acquainted an English Merchant's Wife with her Love; who at first fear∣ing her Life was in hazzard, if it should be discovered, put off the Princess with delays; but finding her impationt, and bringing her Jewels and Imbroideries of Gold and Silver, to make her her Friend in this Service; at last she promised to deliver her Letter, written in few Words, viz. Brave English Youth, my Preserver; I, the Sultan's Daughter, am in Love with you; I know you have Courage enough to meet
me, do it this Evening in the Orange-grove behind the Seraglio; and I hope you will have no cause to repent your so doing. Teoraza. Anrelius upon reading it was in many doubts, but consider∣ing what the Princess had already done for him, and calling to mind her excellent Beauty, resolved to go, though at the hazzard of his Life; for it had been no less than Death, had it been discovered, to make love to the Sultaness of the Royal Ottoman Blood; and accordingly he met her, and she kindly recieved and welcomed him; for in Turkey, nice Complements are out of fashion: And, to be brief, after some other meetings, she promised for his sake, to refuse the greatest Princes in the Empire, and turn Christian, if he would make her his Wife; it was agreed between them, that shipping all his Master's Effects in the Fleet ready to sail; she in disguise should go with him into England. And thus the Love of our brave En∣glish Youth, made her enterprize it in a Sailor's Habit, bring∣ing many Caskets of Jewels and Gold with her; and so they safely arrived in England; when coming home and finding his Master's Daughter marryed. The Princess was Baptized by the Bishop of London, at St. Paul's, and then soon after they were marryed in great Pomp. Aurelius's Master being at the charge of the Wedding; so that the Festival lasting six Days, all the Turkey Merchants graced the Wedding, as did the Lord-Mayor and Aldermen; and the Queen hearing of this great Princess, sent for her to Court, and kindly enter∣tained her; and at her request, sent such prevailing Letters to Amurath the Turkish Sultan, that after his stormy Fury was over, he began to have a liking of the Match; and, in∣viting his Son-in-law, without fear of harm, to trade in his Country, and he would make him the richest Merchant in the World: Which accordingly he did, and encreased in Wealth exceedingly: having all his Goods in Turkey, inward and out∣ward bound, (Custom free;) and for his sake the English Merchants had many Priviledges granted them, and were esteemed above other Nations, which in a good measure con∣tinues to this Day.
Chap. VII. How he served a Jew for cheating him with coun∣terfeit Jewels, from whence the Custom of Bumpin, at the Post at Billinsgate, on Easter-monday arises; his great Charity to the Poor; his Death, and the memorable Epitaph, placed on his Tomb. AƲrelius in his Trading, still encreasing, and bringing great Riches to England, at length a Jew came to him, pretending he had Jewels of great Price, and he not well known in the Country; if he could put them off for him, he would think himself ever oblig'd to him, and would reward him to his content. Aurelius, who thought he meant honestly, undertook it, not regarding Rewards, and they appearing excellent in Lustre, made no farther enquiry; but believed the Man, and sold them to a great Court Lady for six hundred Pounds, which Money he gave the Jew, and he laughing in his sleeve, sneaked away to Holland, thinking at this rate any thing would pass upon the English; and there making more, for they were no other than Christial and such like, fine∣ly set off, came again and proposed as before, but in the mean while, the Plot had been discovered, for the Lady having oc∣casion for Money, and going to pawn them to a Goldsmith, they were found to be Counterfeits; whereupon she undeser∣vedly reproached Aurelius, who told her how he came by them, and freely returned her the Money; and now he took the cou∣zening Jew to task, but he not having Money to satisfie him, he scorned to throw him in Goal, to lye lousing and starving as many would have done, and as indeed he deserved; but living near Billingsgate, all the Satisfaction he took of him, was to order his four Men, each to take a Hand and a Leg, it being then Easter-monday and carry him to a Post on the Key, and there by swinging him backward and forward to bump his Arse soundly against it; and that was all the satis∣faction he had for his six hundred Pounds. And in memory of this, the 'Prentices and Porters thereabouts, keep up a Cu∣stom to do it, to any they catch on that Day near the Place;
concluding the Jew's Bum made not satisfaction for the Mo∣ney, and so they will Bump on till they think the Merchant's Money is out. But to conclude, when he found himself in his declining Years he ordered fourscore poor-People to cme every Morn∣ing to his door, who received twelve Pence a piece, and en∣creased the number as his Years encreased, to his dying Day. His Pricess dyed before him, for whm he built alstately Monument, in which he also was laid, and this Epitaph affixed on it: The EPITAPH. In Cheshire born, I did through Dangers wade, And with Success did drive the Merchant's Trade; Riches I got; I did befriend the P; So wish I all to do who have good store: The Comfort of it in my Life I found, But now more happy in't, though under ground; Eternal Life it purchases for me, The best of Christian Life is Charity: Therefore do well to these that are in want, And you will find Rewards in Heaven not scant. Thu, Reader, have I revived this ancient Hostory of the famed London' Prentice (rch Merchant) which for many Years has lay in Obscurity; which no doubt will be a great encouragement to Youth, to be Virtuous and Valiant, and to those of elder Years, to hope by industry from a small begin∣ning  to great Advance; and if both succeed, I have my Wish. FINIS.
