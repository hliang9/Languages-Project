The CASE of the Peo∣ple, call'd Quakers, as it con∣cerns an Affirmation, which they desire may be extended to all Britain. THE Legislature being acquainted, with the Quakers Con∣scienclously scrupling to take any Oath, did very tender∣ly, and favourably, grant them an Affirmation to be used instead of an Oath. But the said Affirmation, (notwithstanding the Union of the two Kingdoms) doth not extend to Scotland; and many of the said People in the Northern Countries, and divers other Parts of England, do conscienciously scruple that Affirmation (even to their own Prejudice, in respect of their Properties) because as they think, the Title of the Act seems to intimate, as if it was an Oath, (tho' not in the usual Form) and that there are Expressions in the Affirmation it self, which are too much like an Oath; of which mind are the said People in Scotland. For these Reasons, the said People, call'd Quakers, do now apply to the Parliament, for such an Affirmation, as will be agreeable to the Religious Sentiments of their Friends, in North-Britain, and elsewhere. And the said People are willing, that not only the pre∣sent Penalties of Perjury, but also such farther Punish∣ment, as shall be thought meet, be inflicted on them, in case they falsly, or corruptly, make use of the Affirmation they desire. Thus, with the greatest Security to others, they may be, both eased, with respect to their Scruples, and rendred more generally useful, to their Neighbours, and themselves. All which is Humbly submitted the Legislature.
THE CASE Of the People, called QUAKERS.
