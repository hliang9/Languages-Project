G. Looke vpon the letter. letters quickly. They will disclose or make knowen. dispatch all the matter vnto vs. H. Hearken.

THese dialogues may suf∣fice for this Booke. The rest which remaine, I haue o∣mitted to translate, as not so fit: and referre you to Corde∣rius, beeing more pure Latine, and meater for children.
To the louing Reader. GOod Reader, where∣as I haue been and am daily much cal∣led vpon for perfor∣mance of my pro∣mise in publishing the translati∣ons mentioned in my Grammar∣schoole, & this specially amongst others, as being through long cu∣stom accounted by many very fit for the entrance of young scho∣lars, to learne to speake and talke in Latin, I haue thought it equall to condescend vnto their re∣quests. And herein I haue labou∣red to referre all the ouer-harsh Grammaticall, translations and phrases into the margent by an Asterisk, lest the children should
learn barbarism in our own tong, (whereof they haue perpetual and principal vse) whilst they seek to get the Latine; and to the end to teach them to vtter the Latine in our owne phrase of speech. Also for so much as there are sundry speeches vnmeete to season the childrens mindes, whereof some are Popish, others profane and filthie, those I haue for the most part omitted, or else translated them in the best and most modest sense: On the one side hauing bin affraid to leaue any part of my promise vnperformed, which should bee thought profitable; and more fearefull on the other, to corrupt their tender mindes or manners, whilst I seeke to doe good to all. Vpon this ground & occasion I haue omitted some few Dialogues, in the end of all, which are of this nature in many
things, viz. vnsauorie, Popish, or both; & referre both the reacher & learner to Corderius Dialogues, which is of another straine, and farre more meer. For the vse of it, I referre thee to that which I haue duised in the prefaces to the reader before Corderius, Sententiae, Cato, and my other translations, and rest Thine, still labouring for the common good I.
