The Humble REMONSTRANCE OF Sir Frederick Hammilton, Knight and Colonell. TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE THE COMMITTEE OF BOTH KINGDOMS.
I Have served King JAMES and King CHARLS, neer this thirty yeer in their Court, as a Gen∣tleman of their Privy Chamber, without Pension or Monopoly; and for most of that time, I have had a Command in the Old Army in Ireland. King JAMES having in his life time conferred upon me, the Troop of Horse, with the Foot Company, and the Government of Car∣rickfergus, which were Commanded by the old Lord Chichester. Afterwards I levied a Regiment of Foot, and was with Honourable Recommendations, imploy∣ed by His Majestie into Germany, where I served some yeers under the glorious and victorious Prince, the King of Sweden, returning with His Royall Recommendations, and good acceptance of my Ser∣vices, witnessed with His Princely Tokens, bestow∣ed upon me. At my return it hath been heard of, what hard measure I met withall in Ireland, by the power, and greatnesse, of the late Earl of Strafford; whose designe was apparent, the ruine of my Honour and Fortune, if the Lord had not of his great Mercy inabled me with courage, to stand for my innocency, for the defence of both. Since this horrid Rebellion, how I have been ingaged with a poor handfull of men, and what wonderfull things God hath done for us, and with us, is not unknown to my greatest Enemies, though they call me a bragger.
After it pleased God to inable me, to bring off my Wife and Children from the great miseries they suffered, without any comfort or relief, leaving my Castle and Garrison in the best condition I could, procuring the Souldiers leave to apply my self hither, with hopes of better preferment for my self, and speedy relief for them. Coming to London-Derry where I had some For∣tune left me by my Wifes Father, Sir John Vaughan, who died Governour of the said Citie. I found that means he left me, and all my Tenants, in∣croached upon by the Regiments there, who had taken of me and my Tenants, to the value of three thousand pounds; Notwithstanding the se∣verall reliefs they received both from England and Scotland; besides the great sums they have got of other mens Lands, and the severall great Preyes hath been got amongst them since this Rebel∣lion.
Finding my self so used by them, and not able to Command my own Rents and Tenants, having been as active in the Service, as any Colonell a∣mongst them, and the means of keeping them so free from the incursion of the Rebels out of Connaught, Did think in Honour and Justice, my own Lands and Tenants undestroyed, should have been laid off for my own quarters and maintenance; but finding neglect, and hard-heartednesse amongst them, I was forced to apply my self to my Noble Friends in Scotland, who were pleased to take my hard con∣dition and great charge, into their Honourable and Charitable Care, and Consideration, and to ap∣point me the Command of a Regiment of Horse there, untill they could be the instruments of pro∣curing me from the Honourable Parliament here, some greater power and preferment for the better inabling me to go on with the Service there in Ireland.
I being in Scotland, news was brought to the Committee of Estates there, of the dangerous dis∣contented condition of their Army in Ireland, neer Carrickfergus; and how through want of means, they were necessitated to joyn themselves in a dan∣gerous Oath, to stick to one another in applying themselves towards the Parliament of England, for performance of what was promised them: Which miserable extremity of theirs, the State of Scotland indeavoured to relieve and suppresse, so long as they could; untill at length two or three Regi∣ments did forsake that Kingdom, as the rest in∣tended (to the no small hazard of all the three King∣doms) had not the State of Scotland, out of their judi∣cious care, made use of me, and Sir Mungoe Campbell, a Colonell of that Army, whom they sent with instructions, to indeavour the appeasing of their discontents, and to perswade the rest of the Regi∣ments, not to abandon that Kingdom, and to leave it into the hands of the Rebels; who at that time were apparently in a readinesse to have entered upon the Countrey, so soon as the Scots Army had forsaken it, being confident (as many others were) that no perswasions could alter their resolutions from going: Neverthelesse, it pleased God, be∣yond expectation, so to blesse our indeavours, and instructions, as we prevailed with them, and our words were taken for a time, to stay, untill the State of Scotland were advertised with what we had undertaken for, in their names, should be speedily sent them from Scotland, which accordingly was performed, notwithstanding their own great bur∣dens at that time. I was afterwards the immediate instrument, and best help to the Ministers, who were intrusted with the Solemn League and Covenant, to get it taken by the Citizens of London-Derry, the Regiments and Countrey thereabouts; who will confesse, that without me, it had not so easily past, if at all, at that time. Notwithstanding all these pretences and ser∣vices, besides the severall Recommendations of the Parliament, and Committee of Estates in Scotland, have I waited here neer this eight moneths, in ex∣pectation of some course to be taken with me, for the recompence of my past Services, and incou∣ragements to go on, and as yet have met with neither.
Therefore prayeth leave to inform what danger I apprehend will follow to the Publike Service, if I shall be thus neglected and discountenanced for my faithfull Services. If Sir Charls Coote, a young Gentleman, whose hopefull expectation I will not except against, what the Parliament shall think fin to confer upon him, so as his preferment do not in∣trench upon the prejudice of the Publike Service, or upon my Honour and Interest; wherein I conceive both will suffer, if the resolution hold as is reported, to make him Lord Precedent of Connaught. And what content it will be to the Rebels, when they shall hear my Services against them, hath been so rewarded, as not onely the Counties of Sligoe, and Leitrim; which God hath inabled me to do so great Service in, since this Rebellion, without the help of Sir Charls Coote, who must by this Title injoy the fruits of my Labour; as also be Com∣mander of my own Castle and Garrison, and such well deserving Souldiers in it, as hath served neer this six yeers, without means, but out of my own Fortune hath maintained Officers and Souldiers, there being neer 6000. pounds in Arrear, due to me; And having lost as great a Fortune in that Kingdom, in Stock, and Rent, as any here hath, What such hard usage may produce, and what dishonour this will be to me, to have another put over my head, with the charge of those two Counties, wherewith I was at the beginning of this Rebellion intrusted, by Warrant and Commission, from the Lords Justices, and Councell of that Kingdom, to raise, and Com∣mand, what numbers of men I thought fit for the Service; and now to be turned out of this trust, after all my long Service, great losse, and sufferings, unquestioned for any misdemeanours, or neglect in that Charge, I humbly submit to your Honours Judicious Wisdoms.
Tendering to your further considerations, my weak opinion out of my knowledge and experience of the Countrey, and out of my faithfull zeal for the advancement of the Service; what I hold fittest for the present to be done concerning Connaught. That according as I joyned in a Paper with Sir Charls Coote, mentioning the way we intended to prosecute the War there: We may be inabled with equall power to help one another, as we shall stand in need, and that I may be trusted onely with those two Counties, with what proportion of the Supplies shall be thought fitting for me to make use of. That Sir Charls Coote may Command the rest of the whole Province, consisting of four Counties, which he may the easier deal withall, I taking charge of the other two, which I have so long served for; and it were hard measure, if not in∣justice, to turn me out of the Province, and out of my own house with disgrace, which must be no other∣wise, if he must be Lord Precedent of Connaught; yet rather then I should in any way appear in opposi∣tion to the Parliaments pleasure (if it were not to in∣forme them of the conveniences and dangers, which may concern their own services) I should choose to forsake all.
Consider likewise, that Sir Charles Cootes House, and Being, is so far remote from Sligoe, and those parts in Leitrim, wherein I live, as with no conve∣niency can he do Service there, without neglecting the Countrey where he lives, being neer fifty miles distant. If the Parliament be resolved not to give ear or credit to my opinion or advice, let me have my Ar∣rears, and contentment for my house, and interrest in that Province, and dispose of me elsewhere, at their pleasure. Frederick Hammilton. FINIS.
