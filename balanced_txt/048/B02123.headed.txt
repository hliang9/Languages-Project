C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms PROCLAMATION For the CONVENTION of ESTATES. CHARLES, by the Grace of GOD, King of Scotland, England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. To all and sundry Our good Subjects Whom these presents do or may concern, Greeting. The great care We have of the honour and safety of that Our ancient Kingdom, moved Vs some moneths ago to give Order for the raising of such Forces, both Horse and Foot, as We conceived necessary to prevent a sudden Invasion; And seing that just and necessary War in which We are engaged doth still continue, We do think it neces∣sary to keep up these Forces, for the defence of that Our King∣dom, as long as the present danger from Foreign Enemies remains. Therefore, to the end, the easiest and most regular way of their maintenance may be agreed upon, We have thought fit to call a Convention of the Estates of that Our ancient Kingdom, to meet at Edinburgh upon the ninth day of January next to come; And do hereby require and command all Archbishops, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Bishops, Lords and Officers of State of that Our Kingdom, to be present and attend that Dyet; And also We do require all Our Sheriffs in the several Shires and their Deputies, that if there be any new Elections made for this year of Commissioners to Parliaments or Conventions, they make timous intimation to those Commissioners to keep this Meeting: but if there be no Elections already made, that then they forth∣with call and conveen all the Free-holders in the respective Shires, that according to the Laws and Acts of Parliament, Elections may be made of fit persons to be Commis∣sioners for this Convention, and that Our Royal Burroughs make choice of Commis∣sioners accordingly, and that they, and all other persons having interest, attend this Convention of Our Estates, under the pains contained in Our Laws made there∣anent. And that all Our good Subjects may have notice of this Our Royal Will and Pleasure, We do hereby command Our Lyon King at Armes, and his Brethren Heraulds, Macers, Pursevants and Messengers at Armes, to make timous Proclama∣tion hereof at the Mercat-cross of Edinburgh, and at the Mercat-crosses of the head Burroughs in the several Shires of that Our Kingdom. Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the twenty fifth of October, one thousand six hundred and sixty six, and of Our Reign the eighteenth year.
