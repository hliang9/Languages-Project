THE Grand Question RESOLVED, What we must do to be SAVED. INSTRUCTIONS FOR A Holy Life: BY The Late Reverend Divine, Mr. RICHARD BAXTER. Recommended to the Book∣seller a few days before his Death, to be immediately Printed for the good of Souls. Acts 16. 30. Sirs, What must I do to be Saved. LONDON: Printed for Tho. Parkhurst, at the Bible and Three Crowns in Cheap-side, 1692.
The Great Case Resolved, How to be certainly SAVED. Instructions for a Holy Life. I. The Necessity, Reason and Means of Holiness. II. The Parts and Practice of a Holy Life. For Personal Direction, and for Family Instruction. With two short Catechisms, and Prayers. Reader, IGnorant Persons cannot remember long and many words, nor understand a brief stile and few words. This maketh it impossible to write a Catechism, that shall not be unsuitable ei∣ther to the Understanding or the Memory of such. I must therefore desire the Teacher to make up this unavoidable Defect, by opening the (especially of the Catechisms) to the Children and Servants, when they have learned and say the words: Read the Instructions often to them, and press all as you go on their Affections. For the bare words without a present Guide, may e be all lost.
I. The Necessity, Reason, and Means of Holiness. 1. To keep up the Resolutions of the Converted. And, 2. To instruct those in Families that need them. THough theMar. 8. 36. Mat. 6. 33. Job. 21. 14. and 22. 17. Psal. 1. 2, 3. Psal. 14. and 12. saving of Souls be a matter of unexpressible Importance, yet (the Lord have mercy upon them;) What abundance are there that think it not worthy of their serious Enquiry, nor the reading of a good Book, one hour in a Week? For the sake of these careless slothful Sinners, I have here spoken much in a little room, that they may not refuse to read and consider so short a Lesson, unless they think their Souls worth nothing. Sinner, as thou wilt shortly an∣swer it before God, deny not to God, to thy self, and me, the sober pondering, and faithful practising these few Directions. I. Begin at home and know thy self: Consider what it is to be aPsal. 8. 4, 5, 6. Gen. 1. 26, 27, Gen. 9. 6. Col. 3. 10. MAN. Thou art made a nobler Creature than the Brutes. They serve thee, and are governed by thee; and Death ends all their Pains and Pleasures. But thou hast Reason to rule thy self and them; to know thy God, and oresee thy End, and know thy way, and do thy Duty. Thy Reason and Free-will, and Executive Power, are part of the Image of God upon thy Nature; so is thy Domi∣nion over the Brutes, as (under him) thou art their Owner, their Ruler, and their End. But thy Holy Wisdom,
and Goodness, and Ability, is the chief part of his Image, on which thy Happiness depends. Thou hast a Soul that cannot be satisfied in Knowing, till thyJoh. 17. 3. 1 Joh. 4. 6, 7. Jer. 9. 24. Knowledge reach to God himself: Nor can it be disposed by any other: Nor can it (or the Societies of the World) be well go∣verned according to its Nature, without regard to his So∣veraign Authority, and without the hopes andLuk. 12. 4, 5. fears of Joy and Misery hereafter: Nor can it bePsal. 16. 5, to 11. happy in any thing, but seeing, and loving, and delighting in this God, as he is revealed in the other World. And is this Nature given thee in vain? If the Nature of all things be fitted to itsIsa. 45. 18. Vse and End, then it must be so with thine. II. By knowing thy self then, thou must needs know▪ that there is aPsal. 14. 1. Gen. 1. 1. Rev. 1. 8. Rom. 1. 19. 20. Psal. 46. 10. Psal. 9. 10. Psal. 100. and 23. Psal. 19. 1, 2, 3. Psal. 47. 7. Ezek. 18. 4. Gen. 18. 25. Mal. 1. 6. GOD; and that he is thy Maker, and infinite in all Perfections; and that he is thy Owner, thy Ruler, and thy Felicity or End. He is mad that seeth not, that such Creatures have a Cause or Maker; and that all the Power, and Wisdom, and Goodness of the World, is caused by a Power, and Wisdom, and Goodness, which is greater than that of all the World. And who can be our Owner, but He that made us? And who can be our highest Go∣vernour, but our Owner? whose infinite Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, maketh him only fit thereto. And if he be our Governour, he must needs have Laws, with Re∣wards for the Good, and Punishments for the Bad; and must Judge and Execute accordingly. And if he be our Chiefest Benefactor, and all that we have is from him, and all our Hope and Happiness is in him, nothing can be more clear than that the very Nature of Man doth prove, that in Hope of future Happiness, he should absolutely resign himself to the Will and Disposal of this God, and that he
shouldMatth. 22. 37. Jer. 5. 22. 2 Cor. 5. 8, 9. Titus 2. 14. 2 Cor. 8. 5. & 6. 16, 17, 18, 1 Pt. 2. 9. Psal. 10. Psal. 37. 4. Psal. 40. 8. Col. 3. 1. 2. Mar. 6. 20. 21. 2 Cor. 4. 17, 18. absolutely obey him, and that he should love and serve him with all his Power. It being impossible to Love, Obey, and Please that God too much, who is thus our Cause, our End, our All. III. By knowing thus thy self and God, it is easie to know what Primitive Holiness and Godliness is. Even this hear∣ty, entire and absolute resignation of the Soul to God, as the infinite Power, Wisdom, and Goodness; as our Cre∣ator, our Owner, Governour, and Felicity or End; fully submiting to his Disposals; obeying his Laws, in hope of his promised Rewards, and fear of his threatned Pu∣nishments: and loving and delighting in himself, and all his Appearances in the World; and desiring and seek∣ing the endless sight and enjoyment of him in heavenly Glory, and expressing these Affections in daily Prayer, Thanksgiving and Praise. This is the Vse of all thy Fa∣culties; the End and Business of thy Life; the Health and Happiness of thy Soul: This is that Holiness or Godliness which God doth so much call for. IV. And by this it is easie to know, what aPsal. 14. & 1. Heb. 12. 14. Rom. 8. 12, 13. Joh. 3. 34. 5. 6. 1 Joh. 2. 15, 16. Rom. 13. 14, 15. Rom. 6. 16. Luk. 18. 23 & 14. 26, 33. state of Sin and Ungodliness is. Even the want of all this Ho∣liness, and the setting of carnal Self instead of GOD. When Men are proudly Great, and Wise, and Good in their own Eyes; and would dispose of themselves, and all their Concernments, and would rule themselves, and please themselves, according to the fleshly appetite and Fancy; and therefore love most the Pleasures, and Pro∣fits, and Honours of the World, as the Provision to sa∣tisfie the desires of the Flesh; and God shall be no ur∣ther Loved, Obeyed or Pleased, than the Love of Fleshly Pleasure will give leave; nor shall have any thing but what the Flesh can spare. This is a Wicked, a Carnal, an
ungodly State; though it break forth in various ways of Sinning. V. By this, Experience it self may tell you, that most MenRom. 3. Psal. 14. Ephes. 2. 2, 3. Rom. 5. 12. 17. 19. Joh. 3. 6. (yea all, till Grace renew them) are in this ungodly miserable State: (Though only the Scripture tells us how this came to pass) Though all are not For∣nicators, nor Drunkards, no Extortioners, nor Perse∣cuors, nor live not in the same way of Sinning; yet Selfishness, and Pride, and Sensuality, and the love of Worldly Things, Ignorance and Ungodliness are plainly become the common Corruption of the Nature of Man; so that their Hearts are turned to the World from God, and filled with impiety, filthiness, and injustice; and their Reason is but a Servant to their Senses; and their Rom. 8. 5, 6, 7. Mind, and Love and Life, is Carnal; and this car∣nal Mind is Enmity to the Holiness of God, and cannot be subject to his Law. This Corruption is hereditary, and is become, as it were, a Nature to us, being the mor∣tal Malady of all our Natures. And it is easie to know that such an unholy wicked Nature must needs be loath∣some to God, andPsal. 4. 3. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 17. unfit for the happy enjoyment of his Love, either here, or in the Life to come: For what Communion hath Light with Darkness? VI. Hence then it is easie to see, what Grace is needful to a Man's Salvation. So odious a Creature, such an un∣thankful Rebel, that is turned away from God, and set against him, and defiled with all this filth of Sin, must needs be bothPsal. 32. 1, 2. 1 Cor. 6. 11. Tit. 2. 14. Tit. 3. 5, 6, 7. Heb. 14. 14. Mat. 5. 8. Renewed and Reconciled, Sanctified and Pardoned, if ever he will be saved. To love God, and be beloved by him, and to be delighted herein, in the sight of his Glory, is the Heaven and Happiness of Souls; and all this is contrary to an unholy State. Till Men have new and holy Hearts, they can neither see God, nor love him, nor delight in him, nor take him
for their chief Content; for the Flesh and World have their delight and Love. And till Sin beRom. 5. 1, 2, 3. pardoned, and God reconciled to the Soul, what Joy or Peace can it ex∣pect from him, whose Nature and Justice engageth him to loath and punish it? VII. And Experience will tell you, howPsal. 97. 7, 8, 15. 1 Cor. 2. 11, 21. Heb. 14. 12. 2 Pet. 1. 3. insuffici∣ent you are, for either of these two Works your selves; to renew your Souls, or to reconcile them unto God. Will a Nature that is Carnal resist and overcome the Flesh, and abhor the Sin which it most dearly loveth? Will a Worldly Mind overcome the World? When Cu∣stom hath rooted your natural Corruptions, are they easily rooted up? O how great and hard a Work is it, to cause a blind unbelieving Sinner to set his Heart on another World, and lay up all his Hopes in Heaven, and to cast off all the things he seeth, for that God and Glory which he never saw! And for a hardned, worldly, fleshly heart to become Wise, and Tender, and Holy, and Hea∣venly, and abhor the Sin which it most fondly loveth! And what can we do to satisfie Justice, and reconcile such a rebel Soul to God? VIII. Nature and Experience having thus acquainted you with your Sin and Misery, and what you want, will further tell you that GodAct. 14. 27. & 17. 24, 27, 28. Rom. 1. 19. 20. Rom. 2. 4. Job 33. 14. to 25. Mat. 12. 42, 43. doth not yet deal with you according to your deserts. He giveth you Life, and Time, and Mercies, when your Sins had forfeited all these: He obligeth you to repent and turn unto him. And there∣fore Experience telling you, that there is some Hope, and that God hath found out some way of shewing Mer∣cy to the Children of Wrath, Reason will command you to enquire of all that are fit to teach you, what way of Remedy God hath made known. And, as you may soon discover, that the Religion of Heathens and Mahometans, is so far from shewing the true Remedy,
that they are part of the Disease it self: So you may learn, that aIsa. 9. 6, 7. & 53. Joh. 3. 16. 19. & 1. 1, 3, 4. & 3. 2. ohn 1. 18. wonderful Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, hath undertaken the Office of being the Redeemer and Saviour of the World; and that he, who is the Eternal Word and Wisdom of the Father, hath wonderfully appeared in the Nature of Man, which he took from the Virgin Mary, being conceived by the Holy Ghost; and that we might have a Teacher sent from † Heaven infal∣lably and easily to acquaint the World with the Will of God, and the unseen things of Life Eternal: How God Acts 2. 22. Heb. 2. 3, 4. bare Witness of his Truth, by abundant, open, and uncontrouled Miracles:Mat. 4.  How he conquered Satan, and the World, andPet. 2. 22, 23, 24, 25. Mat. 26. 27, 28. Act. 1. Heb. 4. Eph. . . 2. 3. Rom. 5. 1, 3, 9. Heb. 8, 9, 13. & 8. 6, 7. Heb. 7. 25. 1 John 5. 10, 12. John 5. 22. & 3. 18, 19. Mat. 25. gave us an Example of perfect Righteousness, and underwent the Scorn and Cruelty of Sinners, and suffered the Death of the Cross, as a Sa∣crifice for our Sins to reconcile us unto God: How he rose again the third day, and conquered Death, and lived forty days longer on Earth, instructing his Apo∣stles, and giving them Commission to preach the Gospel to all the World; and then ascended bodily into Heaven, while they gazed after him: How he is now in Heaven both God and Man in one Person, the Teacher, and King, and High-Priest of his Church. Of Him must we learn the way of Life; by Him must we be ruled as the Phy∣sician of Souls. All Power is given Him in Heaven and in Earth. By his Sacrifice, and Merits, and Intercession must we be pardoned and accepted with the Father; and only by him must we come to God. He hath procured and established a Covenant of Grace, which Baptism is the Seal of: Even [That God will in him be our God and re∣conciled Father, and Christ will be our Saviour, and the Holy Ghost will be our Sanctifier, if we will unfeignedly consent; that is, if penitently and believingly we give up our selves to
God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in those Resolutions.] This Covenant in the Tenor of it, is a Deed of Gift, of Christ, and Pardon, and Salvation to all the World: f by the true Faith and Repentance they will turn to God. And this shall be the Law according to which he will judge all that hear it at the last; for he is made the judge of All, and will raise all the dead, and will justify his Saints, and judge them unto endless Joy and Glory, and condemn the Unbelievers, impenitent andLuke 16. ungodly, unto endless Misery. The Soul alone is judged at Death, and Body and Soul at the Resurrection. This Gospel the Apostles preached to the World; and that it might be effectual to Mens Salvation, theActs 2. John 17. 23. Holy Ghost was first given to inspire the Preachers of it, and enable them to speak in various Languages, and infallibly to agree in One, and to work many great and open Mira∣cles to prove their Word to those they preached to: And by this means theyMat. 28. 19,  Acts 14. 23. Act. 20. Act. 26. 17, 18. planted the Church; which ordinary Ministers must increase, and teach, and over∣see, to the end of the World, till all the Elect be gather∣ed in. And the sameRom. 8. 9. Holy Spirit hath undertaken it, as his Work, to accompany this Gospel, and by it to convert Mens Souls, illuminating and sanctifying them; and by a secretTit. 3. 5, 6. Joh. 13. 5, 6. Regeneration to renew their Na∣tures, and bring them to that Knowledge, and Obedi∣ence, and Love of God, which is the Primitive Holi∣ness, for which we were created, and from which we fell. And thus by a Saviour and a Sanctifier must all be reconciled and renewed, that will be glorified with God in Heaven. All this you may learn from the Sa∣cred Scriptures, which were2 Tim. 3. 16. written by the Inspi∣ration of the Holy Spirit, and sealed by multitudes of openHeb. 2. 3, 4. Miracles, and contain the very Image and Su∣perscription of God, and have been received and pre∣served
by the Church, as the certain Oracles of God, and blessed by him through all Generations, to the sanctifying of many Souls. IX. When you understand all this, it is time for you to2 Cor. 13. 5. Psal. 4. 4. 2 Pet. 1. 10. look home, and understand now what State your Souls are in. That you were made capable of Holiness and Happiness, you know: that you and all Men are fallen from God, and Holiness, and Happiness, unto Self, and Sin, and Misery, you know: that you are so far redeemed by Christ, you know, as to have a pardoning and saving Covenant tendered you, and Christ and Mercy offered to your choice. But whether you are truly penitent Believers, and renewed by the Holy Ghost, and so united unto Christ, this is the Question yet unresolved; this is the Work that is yet to do, with∣out which there is no Salvation; and if thou die before it is done, wo to thee that ever thou wast a Man. Ex∣cept a Man beJohn 3. 5. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Rom. 8. 7, 9. Phil. 3. 18, 20. Regenerate by the Spirit, and Con∣verted, and made a New Creature, and of Caral be made Spiritual, and of Earthly be made Heavenly, and of Selfish and Sinful be made Holy and Obedient to God, he can never be saved, no more than the Devil himself can be saved. And if this be so, (as nothing is more sure) I require thee now, who readest these words, as thou regardest thy Salvation, as thou wouldest escape Hell Fire, and stand with Comfort before Christ and his Angels, at the last, that thou soberly consider whether Reason command thee not to try thy State; whether thou art thusActs 16. 14. renewed by the Spirit of Christ or not? And toActs 2. 37. & 16. 30. & 11. 23. 2 Cor. 6. 1, 2. Rev. 2. 7. call for help to those that can advise thee, and follow on the search till thou know thy Case. And if thy Soul be a stranger to this sanctifying Work, whether Reason command thee not, without any delay, to make out to Christ, and beg his Spirit, and cast away thy Sins, and give up thy self en∣tirely
to thy God, thy Saviour and Sanctifier, and enter into his Covenant, with a full Resolution never to for∣sake him; to deny thy self, and the desires of the Flesh, and this deceitful transitory World, and lay out all thy hopes on Heaven, and speedily, whatever it cost thee, to make sure of the Felicity which hath no end? And darest thou refuse this when God and Conscience do com∣mand it? And further I advise you, X. Understand how it is that Satan hindreth Souls from being sanctified: That you may know how much to resist his Wiles. Some he deceiveth byActs 24. 14. & 28. 22. & 24. 5, 6. malicious Suggestions, that Holiness is nothing but Fancy or Hy∣pocrisie! (And if God and Death, and Heaven, and Hell, were Fancies, this might be believed.) Some he debau∣cheth by the power of fleshly Appetite and Lust, so that their Sins will not let their Reason speak: Some he keepeth in utter Ignorance, by the evil Education of ignorant Parents, and the negligence ofMal. 2. 7, 9. Hos. 4. 9. ungodly Soul-murdering Teachers: some he deceiveth by world∣ly Hopes, and keepeth their Minds so taken up with worldly Things, that the Matters of Eternity can have but some loose and uneffectual Thoughts, or as bad as none: Some are entangled inProv. 13. 20. ill Company, who make a scorn of a holy Life, and seed them with conti∣nual Diversions and vain Delights: And some are so Ephes. 4. 18, 19. hardened in their Sin, that they are even past feel∣ing, and neither fear God's Wrath, nor care for their Salvation, but hear these things as Men asleep, and no∣thing will awake them: Some are discouraged with a conceit that Godliness is a Life soMal. 1. 13. grievous, sad, and melancholy, that rather than endure it, they will ven∣ture their Souls, come on it what will; (as if it were a grievous Life to love God, and hope for endless Joys, and a pleasant Life to love the World and Sin, and live within a step of Hell!) Some that are convinced, doMat. 25. 3. 8. 12. & 24. 43, 44.
put off their Coversion with Delays, and think it's time enough hereafter; and are purposing and promi∣sing till it be too late, and Life, and Time, and Hope be ended. And some that see there is is a necessity of Ho∣liness▪ areJohn 8. 39, 42, 44. Rom. 3. 1, 2. Gal. 4. 29. Mat. 13. 19, 20, 21, 22. & 15. 2, 3, 6. Gal. 1. 1. cheated by some dead Opinion, or Names, or Shews and Images of Holiness; either because they hold a strict Opinion, or because they joyn with a Reli∣gious Party, or because they are of that which they think is the true Church, or because they are baptized with Water, and observe the outward parts of Worship; and perhaps because they offer God a great deal of Lip-Service, and Lifeless Ceremony, which never savoured of a Holy Soul. Thus Deadness, Sensuality, Worldli∣ness and Hypocrisie, do hinder Millions from Sanctifi∣cation and Salvation. XI. If ever thou wouldest be saved, oppress not Rea∣son by Sensuality or Diversions: But sometimesPsal. 4. 4. Hag. 1. 5. Deut. 32. 7, 29. re∣tire for sober Consideration, distracted and sleepy Rea∣son is unuseful: God and Conscience have a great deal to say to thee: which in a crowd of Company and Bu∣siness thou art not fit to hear. It is aIsa. 1. 3. dolesul case that a Man who hath a God, a Christ, a Soul, a Heaven, a Hell to think of, will allow them none but running Thoughts, and not once in a Week bestow one Hour in Man-like seriousJob 34. 27. Jer. 23. 20. Psal. 119. 59. Consideration of them! sure thou hast no greater things to mind. Resolve then sometimes to spend half an hour in the deepest thoughts of thy everlasting State. XII. Look2 Cor. 4. 8. Deut. 32. 29. 1 John 2. 17. 1 Cor. 7. 31. Luke 12. 19, 20. John 14. 1, 2. 1 Thes. 5. 13. upon this World, and all its Pleasures, as a Man of Reason, who foreseeth the end, and not as a Beast, that liveth but by Sense or present Objects, Do I need to to tell thee, Man, that thou must die? Cannot
Carcases and Dust instruct thee to see the end of Earth∣ly Glory, and all the Pleasures of the Flesh? Is it a Con∣troversie, whether thy Flesh must shortly perish? and wilt thou yet provide for it before thy Soul? What a sad farewel must thou shortly take, of all that World∣lings sell their Souls for! And O how quickly will this be! Alass, Man, the Day is even at hand; a few days more, and thou art gone! and darest thou live unrea∣dy, and part with Heaven for such a World as this? XIII. And then think soberly of theLuke 12. 4. Eccl. 12. 7. 2 Pet. 3. 11. 2 Cor. 4. 18. Phil. 3. 18, 20. Life to come, What it is for a Soul to appear before the living God, and be judged to endless Joy or Misery! If the Devil tempt thee to doubt of such a Life, remember that Nature, and Scripture, and the Worlds Consent, and his own Temptations are Witnesses against him. O Man, canst thou pass one day in Company, or alone in Busi∣ness or in Idleness, without some sober Thoughts of Everlastingness? Nothing more sheweth that the Hearts of Men are asleep or dead, than that the Thoughts of endless Joy or Pain, so near at hand, constrain them not to be Holy, and overcome not all the Temptations of the Flesh, as Toys and inconsiderable Things. XIV. Mark well what Mind most Men are of when they come toNumb. 23. 10. Mat. 25. 8 & 7. 21, 22. Prov. . 28, 29. die! Unless it be some desperate for∣saken Wretch do they not all speak well of a Holy Life? and wish that their Lives had been spent in the most fervent Love of God, and strictest Obedience to his Laws? Do they then speak well of Lust and Pleasures and magnifie the Wealth and Honours of the World? Had they not rather die as the most mortified Saints, then as careless, fleshly, worldly Sinners? And dost thou see and know this, and yet wilt thou not be in∣structed, and be wise in time? XV. Think well what manner of Men these were,
whoseMatth. 23. 29, 30, 31, 33. Heb. 11. 38. John 8. 39. Names are now honoured for their Holiness! What manner of Life did St. Peter, and St. Paul, St. Cyprian, St. Augustine, and all other Saints and Mar∣tyrs live; Was it a Life of fleshly Sports and Pleasures? Did they deride or persecute a Holy Life? Were they not more strictly Holy than any that thou knowest? And is he not self-condemned, that honoureth the Names of Saints, and will not imitate them? XVI. Think what the difference is between a Chri∣stian and anMatth. 10. 15. Rom. 2. Acts 10. 34, 35. Heathen. You are loath to be Heathens or Infidels: But do you think a Christian excelleth them but in Opinion? He that is not Holier than they, s worse, and shall suffer more than they. XVII. Think what the difference is between aRom. 2. 28, 29. Matth. 25. 28. Luke 19. 22. Acts 24. 15. Gal. 4. 29. Godly Christian and an Ungodly. Do not all the Op∣posers of Holiness among us, yet speak for the same God, and Christ, and Scripture; and profess the same Creed and Religion with those whom they oppose? And is not this Christ the Author of our Holiness, and this Scripture the Commander of it? Search and see, whether the difference be not this, that the Godly are serious in their Profession, and the Ungodly are Hypo∣crites, who hate and oppose the practise of the very things which themselves profess; whose Religion ser∣veth but to condemn them, while their Lives are con∣trary to their Tongues. XVIII. Understand what the Devil's Policy is, by rai∣sing so manyEph. 4. 14. Act 20. 30. 1 Cor. 11. 19. 2 Tim. 4. 3 & 2. 14. 16. 1 Tim. 1. 5, 6. Tit. 3. 9. Ephes. 4. 3. &c. 1 Cor. 12. Matth. 12. 25. Rom. 2. 12, 27, 28, 29. Sects and Factions and Controver∣sies about Religion in the World: Even to make some think that they are religious, because they can prare for their Opinions, or because they think their Party is the best, because their Faction is the Greatest, or the
Least; the Uppermost, or the suffering Side. And to turn holy edifying Conference into vain Jangling; and to make Men Aheists, suspecting all Religion, and true to none; because of Mens diversity of Minds. But re∣member that Christian Religion is but One; and a thing easily known by its ancient Rule; and the uni∣versal Church, containing all Christians, is but One. And if carnal Interest or Opinions so distract Men, that one Party saith, We are all the Church; and another saith, It is we, (as if the Kitchin were all the House, o one Town or Village, all the Kingdom;) Wilt thou b mad with seeing this Distraction? Hearken, Sinner, all these Sects in the Day of Judgment shall concur Witnesses against thee, if thou be Unholy; because however else they differed,Gal. 1. 7, 8. Matth. 28. 20. all of them that are Christians, professed the Necessity of Holiness, and sub∣scribed to that Scripture which requireth it. Though thou canst not easily resolve every Controversie, thou mayst easily know-the true Religion; it is that which Christ and his Apostles taught, which all Christians have professed, which Scripture requireth; which is first James 3. 17. pure, and then peaceable; most Spiritual, Heavenly, Charitable and Just. XIX. Away from thatEph. 5. 11. Prov. 23. 20. 2 Cor. 6. 17, 18. Psal. 15. 4. Deut. 13. 3. Company which is sensual, and an Enemy to Reason, Sobriety, and Holiness; and consequently to God, themselves and thee. Can they be wise for thee, that are foolish for themselves? or Friends to thee, that are undoing themselves? or have any pity on thy Soul, when they make a Jest of their own Damnation? Will they help thee to Heaven, who are running so furiously to Hell? chuse better Familiars, if thou wouldest be better. XX. Judge not of a holy Life by hearsay, for it cannot so be known.John 5. 40. Luke 14. 29, 30. John 6. 35, 37, 45. Try it a while, and then judge as
thou findest it. Speak not against the things thou know∣est not. Hadst thou but lived in the Love of God, and the lively belief of endless Glory, and the Delights of Holiness, and the Fears of Hell, but for one Month or Day; and with such a Heart, HadstIsa. 55. 6, 7. cast away thy sin, and called upon God, and ordered thy Family in holy manner, especially on the Lord's Day; I dare boldly say, Experience would constrain thee toMatth. 11. 19. ju∣stifie a holy Life. But yet I must tell thee, it is not rue Holiness, if thou do but try it withLuke 14. 33. Excep∣tions and Reserves: If therefore God hath convinced thee that this is his Will and Way, I adjure thee, as in his dreadful Presence, that thouRev. 22. 17. John 1. 12. Rev. 2. & 3. 1 John 5. 12, 13. Psal. 34. 7. Psal. 73. 26. Matth. 25. Luke 20. 39. Heb. 2. 3.  Thes. 2. 12. delay no longer, but resolve, and absolutely give up thy self to God as thy Heavenly Father, thy Saviour, and thy Sanctifier, and ake an everlasting Covenant with him, and then he and his Mercies will be thine; his Grace will help thee, nd his Mercy pardon thee; his Ministers will instruct hee, and his People pray for thee, and assist thee; his Angels will guard thee, and his Spirit comfort thee: and when Flesh must fail, and thou must leave this World, thy Saviour will then receive thy Soul, and bring t into the participation of his Glory; and he will raise hy Body, and justifie thee before the World, and make hee equal to the Angels; and thou shalt live in the ight and Love of God, and in the Everlasting Pleasures f his Glory: This is the end of Faith and Holiness. But thou harden thy Heart, and refusest Mercy, 19. 27. Prov. 29. 1. & 1. 25. e∣verlasting Wo will be thy portion, and then there will be no remedy. And now, Reader, I beg of thee, and I beg of God on my bended knees, that these few words may sink into thy Heart, and that thou wouldest read them over and over again, and bethink thee as a Man that must
shortly die. Whether any deserve thy Love and Obedi∣ence more than God? and thy thankful Remembrance more then Christ, and thy Care and Diligence more than thy salvation? Is there any Felicity more desira∣ble than Heaven? or any Misery more terrible than Hell? or any thing so regardable as that which is e∣verlasting? Will a few days fleshly Pleasures pay for the loss of heaven and thy immortal Soul? or will thy Sin and thy Prosperity be sweet at Death, and in the Day of Judgment? As thou art a Man, and as ever thou believest that there is a God, and a World to come, and as thou carest for thy Soul, whether it be saved or dam∣ned, I beseech thee, I charge thee, think of these things! think of them once a day at least! think of them with thy most sober serious Thoughts! Heaven is not a May-game, and Hell is not a Flea-biting! Make not a jest of Salvation or Damnation! I know thou livest in a Di∣stracted world, where thou mayest hear some laughing at such things as these, and scorning at a Holy Life, and fastning odious Reproaches on the Godly, and merrily drinking, and playing, and prating away their Time, and then saying, that they will trust God with their Souls, and hope to be saved without so much ado! But if all these Men do not change their minds, and be not shortly down in the Mouth, and would not be glad to eat their Words, and wished that they had lived a holy Life, though it had cost them Scorn and Suffering in the World, let me bear the shame of a Deceiver for ever: But if God and thy Conscience bear witness against thy Sin, and tell thee that a holy Life is best, regard not the Gain-sayings of a Bediam World, which is drunk with the Delusions of the Flesh: But give up thy Soul and Life to God by Jesus Christ in a faithful Covenant! Delay no longer, Man, but resolve; Resolve immediately, resolve unchangeably; And God will he thine, and thou shalt be his for ever. Amen. Lord have Mercy on this Sinner, and to let it be resolved by thee in him.
II. The Parts and Practice of a Holy Life for Personal and Family Instructions. ALL is not not1 Cor. 1. 25. Heb. 4. 1. 2 Pet. 2. 22. 1 Cor. 3. Gal. 3. & 4. Matth. 13. 41. & 18. 7. done when men have begun a Reli∣gious Life: All Trees that blossom prove not fruitful; and all Fruit comes not to perfection. Many fall off, who seemed to have good Beginnings: And many dishonour the Name of Christ, by their Scandals and Infirmities: Many do grieve their Teachers Hearts, and lamentably disturb the Church of Christ, by their Ignorance, Errors, Self-conceitedness, Unruliness, Headi∣ness, Contentiousness, Sidings and Divisions: Insomuch that thePhil. 3. 18, 19. Acts 20. 30. Scandals and the Feuds of Christians are the great Impediments of the Conversion of the Infidel and Heathen World, by the exposing Christianity to their contempt and scorn, as if it were but the Error of men, as unholy and worldly, and proud as others, that can never agree among themselves: And many by their Passions and Selfishness are a Trouble to the Families and Neighbours where they live: And more by their Weaknesses and great Distempers, are Snares, Vexa∣tions, and Burdens to themselves. Whereas Christi∣anity in its true Constitution, is a Life of such HolyMatth. 5. 16. 1 Pet. 3. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 15. & 1. 8. 2 Cor. 1. 21. Light and Love, such Purity and Peace, such Fruitfulness and Heavenliness, as if it were accordingly shewed forth in the Lives of Christians, would command Admiration and Reverence from the World, and do more to their Conversion, than Swords or Words alone can do: and it would make Christians useful and amiable to each other: And their Lives a Feast and pleasure to them∣selves. I hope it may prove some help to these Excel∣lent Ends, and to the securing Mens Salvation, if in a few sound Experienced Directions I open to you the Duties of a Christian Life,
I. Keep still the true2 Tim. 1. 13. & 3. 7. Heb. 5. 12. Phil. 1. 9. Rom. 15. 14. Form of Christian Doctrine, Desire and Duty, orderly printed on your Minds: That is, Understand it clearly and distinctly, and remember it, I mean the Great Points of Religion contained in Cate∣chisms. You may still grow in the clearer understand∣ing of your Catechisms, if you live an hundred Years: Let not the Words only, but the Matter, be as familiar in your Minds, as the Rooms of your House are. Such Eph. 4. 13, 14. Col. 1. 9. & 2. 2. & 3. 10. 1 Tim. 6. 4. solid Knowledge will establish you against Seduction and Unbelief, and will be still within you a ready Help for every Grace, and every Duty; as the Skill of an Artificer is for his Work: And for want of this, when you come among Infidels or Hereticks, their Reasonings may seem unanswerable to you, and shake, if not over∣throw your Faith; And you will easily err in lesser Points, and trouble the Church with your Dreams and Wranglings. This is the Calamity of many Professors; that while they will be most censorious Judges in every Controversie about Church-matters, they know not well the Doctrine of the Catechism. II. Live daily by Faith onJohn 17. 3. Ephes. 3. 17, 18. Mat. 28. 19. Ephes. 1. 22, 23. & 4. 6, 16. Rom. 5. 2 Cor. 12. 9. John 16. 33. 1 John 5. 4.  4. 14, 16. Col. 3. 3, 4. Acts 7. 59. Jesus Christ, as the Media∣tor between God and you. Being well-grounded in the Belief of the Gospel, and understanding Christ's Office, make use of him still in all your Wants. Think on the Fatherly Love of God, as coming to you through him alone: and of the Spirit, as given by him your Head, and of the Covenant of Grace as enacted and sealed by him; and of the Ministry as sent by him; and of all Times and Helps, and hopes as procured and given by him. When you think of Sin, and Infirmity, and Temptations, think also of his sufficient, pardonin, justifying and victorious Grace. When thou thinkest of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, think how he
overcometh them. Let his Doctrine and the Pattern of his most perfect Life, be always before you as your Rule. In all your Doubts, and Fears, and Wants, go to him in the Spirit, and to the Father by him, and him alone. Take him as the Root of your Life and Mercies, and live as upon him and by his Life; and when you die, resign your Souls to him, that they may be with him where he is, and see his Glory. To live on Christ and use him in every Want, and address to God, is more than a general confused Believing in him. III. So believe in the Holy Ghost, as toGal. 5. 16, 25. live and work by him, as the Body doth by the Soul. You are notMatth. 28. 19. bapti∣zed into his Name in vain; (but too few understand the sense and reason of it.) The Spirit is sent by Christ for Two great Works. 1. To the Apostles and Prophets, to John 16. 13. Heb. 2. 34. inspire them infallibly to preach the Gospel, and con∣firm it by Miracles, and leave it on Record for follow∣ing Ages, in the Holy Scriptures. 2. To all his1 Cor. 12. 12, 13. Rom. 8. 9. 13. Joh. 3. 5, 6. Members, to illuminate and sanctifie them, to believe and obey this Sacred Doctrine (beside his common Gift to many to understand and preach it.) The Spirit ha∣ving first indicted the Gospel, doth by it first regenerate, and after govern all true Believers. He is not now given s for the revealing of new Doctrines, but to under∣stand and obey the2 Tim. 3. 15, 16. Jude 19. 20. Doctrine revealed and sealed by him long ago. As the Sun doth by its sweet and discreet Influence, both give and cherish the natural life of things Sensitive and Vegetative; so doth Christ by hisEzek. 36. 27. Isa. 44. 3. Rom. 8. 1, 5. 1 Cor. 6. 11. Zech. 14. 20. Spi∣rit our spiritual Life. As you do no work but by your natural Life, you should do none but by your spiritual Life: You must not only Believe, and Love and pray by it, but manage all your Calling by it; for Holiness to the lord must be written upon all; All things are sanctified to you, because you being sanctified to God, devote
all to him, and use all for him; and therefore must do all in the Strength and Conduct of the Spirit. IV.1 Cor. 10. 31. Rom. 11. 36. 2 Cor. 5. 7, 8. 1 John 3. 1 Rom. 5. 1, 2, 3. Mat. 22. 37. Ephes. 1. 6. 2 Cor. 5. 19. Gal. 4. 4, 5, 6. Live wholly upon God, as All in All: As the first Efficient, principal Dirigent, and final Cause of all things. Let Faith, Hope, and Love, be daily feeding on him. Let Our Father which art in Heaven, be first in∣scribed on your Hearts, that he may seem most amiable to you, and you may boldly trust him, and filial Love may be the spring of Duty. Make use of the Son and Spirit to lead you to the Father; and of Faith in Christ to kindle and keep alive the Love of God. God's Love is our Primitive Holiness, and especially called, with its Fruits, [Our Sanctification,] which Faith in Christ is but a means to. Let it be your principal End, in studying Christ, to see the Goodness, Love, and Amiableness of God in him: A condemning God is not so easily loved, as a gracious reconciled God. You have so much of the Spirit, as you have Love to God: This is the proper Gift of the Spirit to all the adopted Sons of God, to cause them, with filial Affection and Dependance, to cry, Abba, Father. Know not, desire not, love not any Creature, but purely as subordinate to God! Without him, let it be nothing to you, but as the Glass without the Face, or scattered Letters without the Sense; or as the Corps without the Soul.Psal. 30. 5. & 63. 3. Call nothing Prospe∣rity or Pleasure, but his Love; and nothing Adversity or Misery, but his Displeasure, and the Cause and the Fruits of it. When any thing would seem lovely and desirable which is against him, call itPhil. 3. 7, 8. Dung! And hear that Man, asMat. 16. 13. Satan, or the Serpent, that would entice you from him; and count him but Vanity, a Worm, and Dust, that would affright you from your Duty to him. Fear him much, but love him more! Let2 Thess. 3. 5. 2 Cor. 13. 14. Love be the Soul and End of every other Duty:
It is the End and Reason of all the rest; but it hath no End or Reason, but its Object. Think of no other Heaven, and End, and Happiness of Man, but Love, the final Act, and God the final Object: Place not your Religion in any thing but the Love of God, with its Means and Fruits. Own no Grief, Desire, or Joy, but a mourning, a seeking, and a rejoycing Love. V. Live in the belief and hopes of Heaven, andCol. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. Mat. 6. 19, 20, 21, 33. 2 Cor. 4. 17, 18. & 7. Luk. 12. 20. Heb. 6. 20. 1 Cor. 15. 28. Ephes. 4. 6. & 1. 23. Phil. 3. 18, 20. Psal. 73. 25, 26. Joh. 18. 36. seek it as your Part and End; and daily delight your Souls in the sore-thoughts of the endless Sight and Love of God. As God is seen on Earth but as in a Glass, so is he proporti∣onably enjoyed. But when mourning, seeking Love hath done, and Sin and Enemies are overcome, and we behold the Glory of God in Heaven, the Delights of Love will then be perfect. You may desire more on Earth than you may hope for. Look not for a Kingdom of this World, nor for Mount Zion in the Wilderness. Christ reigneth on Earth, as Moses in the Camp, to guide us to the  and of the Promise: Our perfect Blessedness will be, where the Kingdom is delivered up to the Fa∣ther, and God is All in All. A Doubt, or a strange heartless thought of Heaven, is Water cast on the sa∣cred Fire, to quench your Holiness and your Joy. Can you travel one whole day to such an End, and never think of the Place that you are going to? which must be intended in every righteous Act (either notedly, or by the ready unobserved Act of a potent Habit.) When Earth is at the best, it will not be Heaven. You live no further by Faith, like Christians, than you either live for Heaven in seeking it, or else upon Heaven in Hope and Joy. VI. Labour to make Religion your Pleasure andPsal. 1. 2, 3. & 84. 2, 10. & 63. 3, 5. & 37. 4. & 91. 19. & 119. 47, 70. Isa. 58. 14. Psal. 112. 1. Rom. 14. 17. & 5. 1, 3, 5. 1 Pet. 1. 8. Mat. 5. 11, 12. Psal. 32. 11. De∣light.
Look oft to God, to Heaven, to Christ, to the Spirit, to the Promises, to all your Mercies. Call over your Experiences, and think what matter of high De∣light is still before you, and how unseemly it is, and how injurious to your Profession, for one that saith he hopeth for Heaven, to live as sadly as those that have no higher hopes than Earth. How should that Man be filled with Joy, who must live in the Joys of Heaven for ever? Especially rejoyce when the Messengers of Death do tell you, that your endless Joy is near. If God, and Heaven, with all our Mercies in the way, be not reason enough for a joyful Life, there can be none at all. Abhor all Suggestions which would make Re∣ligion seem a tedious irksome Life. And take heed that you represent it not so to others; for you will never make them in love with that which you make the not perceive to be delectable and lovely. Not as the Hypo∣crite, by forcing and framing his Religion to his carnal Mind and Pleasure; but bringing up the Heart to a holy suitableness to the Pleasures of Religion. VII Watch as for your Souls, against this flattering temptingGal. 6. 14. 1. Joh. 2. 15, 16. Jam. 1. 27. & 4. 4, 5. 1 Joh. 5. 4, 5. Rom. 12. 2. Gal. 1. 4. Tit. 2. 12. Mat. 19. 24. Luk. 12. 16. 21. & 16. 25. James 1. 11. & 5. 1, 2, 4. Luke 8. 14. Heb. 11. 26. World; especially when it is represented as more sweet and delectable, than God, and Holiness, and Heaven. This World with its Pleasures, Wealth, and Ho∣nours, is it that is put in the Ballance by Satan, against God, and Holiness, and Heaven: And no Man shall have better than he chooseth and preferreth. The Bait taketh advantage of the brutish part, when Reason is asleep; and if by the help of Sense it get the Throne, the Beast will ride and rule the Man; and Reason become a slave to Sensuality. When you hear the Serpent, see his Sting, and see Death attending the forbidden Fruit: When you are rising, look down and see how far you have to fall! His Reason, as well as Faith, is weak, who
for such Fools-gawds, as the Pomp and Vanitles of this World, can forget God and his Soul, and Death, and Judgment, Heaven and Hell, yea and deliberately com∣mand them to stand by. What Knowledge or Expe∣rience can do good on that Man, who will venture so much for such a World, which all, that have tried it, call vanity at the last? How deplorable then is a World∣ings case? Oh fear the World when it smileth, or seems sweet and amiable. Love it not, if you love your God and your Salvation. VIII. Fly from Temptations, and crucify theRom. 8. 1, 13. Gal 5. 24. Rom. 13. 14. Gal. 5. 17. ude 8. 23. 2 Pet. 2. 10. Ephes. 2. 3. 1 Pet. 2. 11. Mat. . 13. & 26. 41. Luke 8. 13. Flesh, and keep a constant Government over your Appetite and Se es. Many, who had no designed stated Vice, or worldly Interest, have shamefully fallen by the sudden surprize of Appetite or Lust. When custom hath taught these to be greedy and violent, like a hungry Dog, or a lusting Bar, it is not a sluggish Wish or Purpose, that will mortify or rule them! How dangerous a case is that Man in, who hath so greedy a Beast continually to re∣strain? that if he do but neglect his Watch one Hour, is ready to run him headlong into Hell? Who can be safe that standeth long on so terrible a precipice? The Tears and Sorrows of many Years, may perhaps not re∣pair the loss which one Hour or Act may bring. The ase of David, and many others, are dreadful Warnings. Know what it is that you are most in Danger of; whe∣ther Lust and Idleness, or Excess in Meats, or Drinks or Play; and there set your strongest Watch for your Pre∣servation. Make it your daily Business to mortify that ust, and scorn that your brutish Sense or Appetite should conquer Reason. Yet trust not purposes alone; but away from the Temptation; Touch not, yea look not on the tempting Bait: keep far enough off, if you esire to be safe. What Miseries come from small be∣ginnings? Temptation leads to Sin, and small Sins to
greater, and those to Hell! And Sin and Hell are not to be played with! Open your Sin or Temptation to some Friend, that shame may save you from Danger. IX. Keep up a constant skilful Government over yourJam. 1. 19. & 3. 13, 17. 1 Pet. 3. 4. Mat. 5. 5. Eph. 4. 2, 3. Col. 3. 12. Passions and your Tongues. To this end, keep a tender Conscience, which will smart when in any of these you sin. Let Holy Passions be well ordered, and selfish car∣nal Passions be restrained. Let yourJam. 1. 26. & 3. 5, 6. Psal. 34. 13. Pro. 18. 21. Tongues know their Duties to God and Man, and labour to be skilful and resolute in performing them. Know all the Sins of the Tongue, that you may avoid them; for your Innocency and Peace do much depend on the prudent Government of your Tongues. X. Govern yourDeut. 15. 9. 2 Cor. 10. 5. Gen. 6. 5. Psal. 10. 4 & 94. 19. & 119. 113. Prov. 12. 5. & 15. 26. Psal. 119. 59. Prov. 30. 32. Jer. 4. 14. Deut. 32. 29. Thoughts with constant skilful Dili∣gence. In this, right Habits and Affections will do most, by inclining them unto Good. It's easy to think on that which we love. Be not unfurnished of matter for your Thoughts to work upon: And often retire your selves for serious Meditation. Be not so solitary and deep in Musings, as to over-stretch your Thoughts, and confound your Minds, or take you off from necessary converse with others! But be sure that you be Conside∣rate, and dwell much at Home, and converse most with your Consciences and your God! with whom you have the greatest Business! Leave not your thoughts unimployed, or ungoverned: Scatter them not abroad upon impertinent Vanities. O that you knew what daily business you have for them! Most men are wick∣ed, deceived, and undone, because they are inconside∣rate, and dare not, or will not, retiredly and soberly use their Reason; or use it but as a slave in Chains in the service of their Passion, Lust and Interest. He was never Wise, or Good, or Happy, who was not soberly
and impartially Considerate, How to be Good, to do Good, and finally enjoy Good, must be the sum of all your Thoughts. Keep them first holy, then charita∣ble, clean and chaste. And quickly check them when they look towards sin. XI. LetEphes. 5. 16. Joh. 14. 1, 2. Act. 17. 21. 1 Cor. 7. 29. 2 Cor. 6. 2. Joh. 9. 4. Luk. 19. 42, 44. Psal. 39. 4. Mat. 25. 10, 1. Time be exceeding Precious in your Eyes, and carefully and diligently redeem it. What haste doth it make? and how quickly will it be gone? and then how highly will it be valued; when a Minute of it can never be recalled? O what important Business have we, for every Moment of our Time, if we should live a thou∣sand Years! Take not that Man to be well in his Wits, or to know his God, his End, his Work, or his Danger, who hath Time to spare. Redeem it, not only from needless Sports, and Plays, and Idleness, and Curiosity, and Complement, and excess of Sleep, and Chat, and Worldliness; but also from the Entanglements of lesser Good, which would hinder you from greater. Spend time, as Men that are ready to pass into another World, where every Minute must be accounted for; and it must go with us for ever as we lived here let not Health deceive you into the expectation of living long, and so into a sensless Negligence. See your Glass running, and keep a reckoning of the expence of Time: and spend it just as you would review it when it is gone. XII. Let the1 Tim. 1. 5, 6. Mat. 19, 19. Rom. 13. 10. 1 John 1. 16. Ephes. 4. 12, 15, 16. Col. 2. 2. & 1. 4. 1 Tim. 6. 11. Jam. 3. 17. Phil. 2. 1, 2. 1 Thes. 4. 93. John 13. 35. Mat. 5. 44, 45. 1 Cor. 13. Jam. 4. 11. Gal. 6. 10. Tit. 2. 14. Phil. 2. 20, 21. Rom. 15. 1, 3. Love of all in their several Capacities become as it were your very Nature: and doing them all the Good you can, be very much of the Business of your Lives. God must be loved in all his Creatures, his natural Image on all Men, and his spiritual Image on his Saints. Our Neighbour must be loved as our natural selves▪
That is, our natural Neighbour as our natural Self, with a Love of benevolence; and our spiritual Neigh∣bour as our spiritual Self, with a Love of Complacence. In opposition to Complacence, we may hate our sinful Neighbour, as we must our selves (much more:) But in opposition to Benevolence we must neither hate our Selves, our Neighbour, or our Enemy. O that Men knew how much of Christianity doth consist in Love, and doing Good! With what Eyes do they read the Gospel, who see not this in every Page? Abhor all that Selfishness, Pride and Passion which are the Enemies of Love; and those Opinions, and Factions, and Censurings, and Back-biting, which would destroy it. Take him that speaketh Evil of another to you, without a just cause and call, to be Satan's Messenger, intreating you to hate your Brother, or to abate your Love. For to perswade you that a Man is bad, is directly to perswade you so far to hate him. Not that the good and bad must be con∣founded: but Love will call none bad without con∣straining evidence. Rebuke Back▪ biters. Hurt no Man, and speak evil of no Man; unless it be not only just, but necessarily to some greater Good. Love is lovely: They that Love shall be Beloved. Hating and hurting makes Men hateful. Love thy Neighbour as thy self; and Do as thou wouldst be done by, are the Golden Rules of our Duty to Men; which must be deeply written on your Hearts. For want of this, there is nothing so false, so bad, so cruel, which you may not be drawn to think, or say, or do against your Brethren. Selfishness and want of Love, do as naturally tend to Ambition and Covetousness, and thence to Cruelty against all that in the Way of their Desires, as the nature of a to kill the Lambs. All Factions, and Conten∣tions, and Persecutions in the World, proceed from Selfishness, and want of Charity. Devouring Malice is the Devilish Nature. Be as zealous in doing gòod to all, as Satan's Servants are in hurting. Take it as the use of all your Talents, and use them as you would hear of
it at last. Let it be your Business and not a matter on, the by: Especially for publick Good, and Mens Salva∣tion. And what you cannot do your selves, perswade other to. Give them good Books: and draw them to the means, which are most like to profit them. XIII. Understand the right Terms of Church-Communion: especially the Unity of the Universal Church, and the Uni∣versal Communion, which you must hold with all the parts; and the difference between the Church as Visible and Invi∣sible. For want of these, how woful are our divisions? Read oft, 1 Cor. 12. & Eph. 4. 1. to 17. Job. 17. 21, 22, 23. Act. 4. 32. & 2. 42. 1 Cor. 1. 10, 11, 13. & 3. 3. Rom. 16. 17. Phil. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 Thes. 5. 12, 13. Act. 20. 30. 1 Cor. 11. 19. Titus. 3. 10. James. 3. Col. 1. 4. Heb. 10. 25. Acts 8. 12, 13, 37. 1 Cor. 1. 2, 13. & 3. 3, 4. & 11. 18, 21. Study these well. You must have Union and Communion in Faith and Love, with all the Chri∣stians in the World. And refuse not local Communion when you have a just call, so far as they put you not on sinning. Let your usual meeting be with the purest Church, if you lawfully may, (and still respect the pub∣lick Good;) But sometimes occasionally communicate even with defective faulty Churches, so be it they are true Christians, and put you not on Sin: that so you may shew that you own them as Christians, though you disown their Corruptions. Think not your pre∣sence maketh all the Faults of Ministry, Worship, or People to be yours (for then I would join with no Church in the World.) Know that as the mystical Church consisteth of Heart-Covenanters, so doth the Church as Visible consist of Verbal-Covenanters, which make a credible profession of Consent: And that Na∣ture and Scripture teacheth us to take every Man's word as Credible, till Perfidiousness forfeit his Credit; which forfeiture must be proved, before any sober Profession can be taken for an insufficient title.Mat. 13. 29, 41. Grudge not then at the Communion of any Professed Christian in
the Church Visible: (though we must do our part to cast out the obstinately impenitent by Discipline; which if we cannot do, the Fault is not ours.) The presence of Hypocrites is no hurt, but oft a Mercy to the Sincere. How small else would the Church seem in the World? Outward Privileges belong to Outward Covenanters; and Inward Mercies to the Sincere.John 16. 2. 1 Cor. 1. 10. Rom. 16. 17. Jam. 3. 14. 15, 16, 17, 18. Division is wounding, and tends to Death. Abhor it as you love the Churches welfare or your own: The Wisdom from above is first pure, and then peaceable. Never sepa∣rate what God conjoineth. It is the Earthly, sensual, devilish Wisdom, which causeth bitter envying, and strife, and confusion, and every evil Work. Blessed are the Peace-makers. XIV. Take heed of1 Tim. 3. 6. Col.  18. 1 Cor. 8. 1. 1 Cor. 4. 6. 1 Tim. 6. 4. 1 Pet. 5. 5. Jam. 3. 1, 17. Pride and Self-conceitedness in Religion: If once you over-value your own under∣standings, your crude Conceptions and gross Mistakes will delight you as some supernatural light: And in∣stead of having compassion on the Weak, you will be unruly and despisers of your Guides, and censorious contemners of all that differ from you; and persecu∣tors of them if you have Power; and will think all intolerable, that take you not as Oracles, and your words as Law. Forget not that the Church hath al∣ways suffered by censorious, unruly Professors on the one Hand, (and O what Divisions and Scandals have they caused!) as well as by the Prophane and Persecu∣cutors on the other. Take need of both: And when Con∣tentions are afoot, be quiet and silent, and not too forward; and keep up a Zeal for Love and Peace. XV. Be faithful and conscionable in all yourEph. 5, & 6. Col. 3, & 4. Rom. 13. 1, 7. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 15. Relations. Honour and obey your Parents, and other Superiors: Despise not, and resist not Government: If you suffer unjustly by them, be humbled for those Sins, which
cause God to turn your Protectors into Afflictors: And instead of murmuring and rebelling against them, re∣form your selves, and then commit your selves to God▪ Princes and Pastors I will not speak to: Subjects, and Servants, and Children, must obey their Superiors, as the Officers of God. XVI. Keep up the Government of God in yourCommand. 4. Josh. 24. 15. Deut. 6. 6, 7, 8. Dan. 6. Fa∣milies. Holy Families must be the chief preservers of the Interest of Religion in the World. Let not the World turn God's Service into a customary lifeless Form. Read the Scripture, and edifying Books to them▪ Talk with them seriously about the State of their Souls, and everlasting Life; Pray with them fervently; Watch over them diligently; Be angry against Sin, and meek in your own cause; Be Examples of Wisdom, Holiness and Patience; And see that the Lord's Day be spent in holy preparation for Eternity. XVII. Let yourHeb. 13. 5. Command. 4. 2 Thess. 3. 10, 12. 1 Thess. 4. 7. 1 Tim. 5. 13. Prov. 31. 1 Cor. 7. 29. Callings be managed in Holiness and Laboriousness. Live not in Idleness; be not slothful in your Work, whether you be Bound or Free; in the sweat of your Brows you must eat your Bread, and la∣bour the six Days, that you may have to give to him that needeth; Slothfulness is Sensuality as well as fil∣thier Sins. The Body (that is able) must have fit Em∣ployments as well as the Soul, or else Body and Soul will fare the worse; but let all be but as the labour of a Traveller, and aim at God and Heaven in all. XVIII. Deprive not your selves of the benefit of an able faithfulMal. 2. 7. Pastor, to whom you may open your Case in se∣cret; or at least of a holyEccles. 4. 10, 11. faithful Friend: And be not Prov. 12. 1. & 15. 5, 10, 31. Heb. 3. 13. displeased at their free Reproofs. Wo to him that is alone! How blind and partial are we in our own Cause and how hard is it to know our selves without an able
faithful Helper! You forfeit this great Mercy, when you love a Flatterer, and angrily defend your Sin. XIX.Luk. 12. 40. 2 Pet. 1. 10. Phil. 1. 21, 23. Jer. 9. 4, 5. Mat. 7. 4, 5. 2 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 4,  Prepare for Sickness, Sufferings, and Death. Overvalue not Prosperity, nor the Favour of Man. If selfish Men prove false and cruel to you, even those of whom you have deserved best, marvel not at it, but pray for your Enemies, Persecutors, and Slande∣rers, that God would turn their Hearts and pardon them. What a Mercy is it to be driven from the World to God, when the love of the World is the greatest danger of the Soul? Be ready to die, and you are ready for any thing. Ask your Hearts seriously, What is it that I shall need at a dying Hour? And let it speedily be got ready, and not be to seek in the time of your Extremity. XX. Understand the true Method of Peace of Conscience, and judge not of the State of your Souls upon deceitful Grounds. As presumptuous Hopes do keep Men from Conver∣sion, and embolden them to sin; so causless Fears do hinder our Love and Praise of God, by obscuring his Loveliness: And they destroy our Thankfulness, and our Delight in God, and make us a Burden to our selves, and a grievous Stumbling block to others. The general Grounds of all your Comfort, are. 1. TheExod. 34. 6. gracious Nature of God. 2. TheHeb. 7. 25. sufficiency of Christ. And. 3. the Truth andJoh. 4. 42. Joh. 3. 16. 1 Tim. 4. 10. & 2. 4. Mat. 28. 19, 20. Rev. 22. 17. Isa. 55. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7. Universality of the Promise, which giveth Christ and Life to all▪ if they will accept him. But this Acceptance is the Proof of your particular Title, without which these do but ag∣gravate your Sin. Consent to God's Covenant is the true Condition and Proof of your Title to God as your Father, Saviour, and Sanctifier, and so to the saving Blessings of the Covenant: Which Consent, if you sur∣vive, must produce the Duties which you consent to.
He that heartily consenteth that God be his God, his Saviour and Sanctifier, is in a state of Life. But this includeth th) rejection of the VVorld; Much Know∣ledge, and Memory, and Utterance, and lively Affecti∣ons, are all very desirable: But you must judge your state by none of these, for they are all uncertain. But, 1. If God, and Holiness, and Heaven, have the highest estimation of your practical Judgment, as being esteem∣ed best for you: 2. And be preferred in the Choice and Resolution of your Wills, and that habitually before all the Pleasures of the VVorld: 3. And be first and chiefly sought in your Endeavours; This is the infallible proof of your Sanctification. Christian, Upon long and serious study and experi∣ence, I dare boldly commend these Directions to thee, as the VVay of God, which will end in Blessedness. The Lord resolve and strengthen thee to obey them. This is the true Constitution of Christianity: This is true Godliness; and this is to be Religious indeed: And all this is no more than to be seriously such, as all a∣mong us in general VVords profess to be. This is the Religion which must difference you from Hypocrites; which must settle you in Peace, and make you an Ho∣nour to your Profession, and a Blessing to those that dwell about you. Happy is the Land, the Church, the Family, which doth consist of such as these! These are not they that either Persecute or Divide the Church, or that make their Religion a servant to their Policy, to their ambitious designs, or fleshl Lusts; nor that make it the Bellows of Sedition or Rebellion, or of an en∣vious hurtful Zeal, or a snare for the Innocent, or a Pistol to shoot at the Upright in Heart: These are not they that have been the shame of their Profession, the hardning of Ungodly Men and Infidels and that have caused the Enemies of the Lord to blaspheme. If any Man will make a Religion of, or for his Lusts; of Pa∣pal Luke 14. 26, 33. 1 John 2. 15. Mat. 6. 19, 20, 21, 33. Col. 3. 1, 2. Rom. 8. 1, 13.
Tyranny, or Pharisaical Formality, or of his pri∣vate Opinions, or of proud censoriousness, and con∣tempt of others, and of Faction, and  warrntable Separations and Divisions, and of standing at a more observable distance from common Professors of Chri∣stianity, than God would have them; or yet of pulling up the Hedg of Discipline, and laying Christ's Vineyard common to the Wilderness; the Storm is coming, when this Religion founded on the Sand will fall, and great will be the fall thereof. When the Religion which con∣sisteth in Faith and Love to God and Man, in mortifying the Flesh, and crucifying the World, in Self-denyal, Hu∣mility and Patience, in sincere Obedience, and faithful∣ness in all Relations, in watchful Self-Government, in doing Good, and in a Divine and Heavenly Life, tho' it will be hated by the ungodly World, shall never be a dishonour to your Lord, nor deceive or disappoint your Souls. A Short Catechism. Quest. 1. WHat is the Christian Religion? Answ. The Christian Religion is the Bap∣tismal Covenant made and kept; wherein God the Fa∣ther, Son and Holy Ghost, doth give himself to be ou reconciled God and Father, our Saviour and Sanctifier and we believingly give up our selves accordingly to him, renouncing the Flesh, the World, and the Devil. Which Covenant is to be oft renewed, specially in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Quest. 2. Where is our Covenant-part and Duty fullier opened? Answ. 1. In the Creed, as the Sum of our Belief. 2. In the Lord's Prayer, as the Sum of our Desires. 3. And in the Ten Commandments (as given us by Christ, with the Gospel-Explications) as the Sum of our Practice. Which are as followeth.
The CREED. I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of Hea∣ven and Earth: And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, which was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was Cru∣cified, dead and buried, he descended into Hell: The third day he arose again from the Dead, he ascended into Heaven, and sitteth on the right Hand of God the Father Almighty, from thence he shall come to Judg▪ the Quick and the Dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints, the Forgiveness of Sins, the Resurrection of the Body, and the Life Everlasting. Amen. The LORD'S Prayer. OUR Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily Bread. And forgive us our Trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us: And lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from Evil; for thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory for ever. Amen. The Ten Commandments. I. I Am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of Bon∣dage: Thou shalt have no other Gods before me. II. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven I∣mage, or any likeness of any thing that is in Heaven a∣bove, or that is in the Earth beneath, or that is in the Water under the Earth; thou shalt not bow down thy self to them, nor serve them: For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children unto the third and fourth Gene∣ration of them that hate me, and shewing Mercy unto
thousands of them that love me and keep my Com∣mandments. III. Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain; For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name in vain. IV. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; six days shalt thou labour and do all thy Work; but the seventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou shalt not do any Work; thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, thy Man-servant, nor thy Maid-servant, nor thy Cattel, nor the Stranger that is within thy Gates. For in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is; and rested the seventh Day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath-Day, and hallowed it. V. Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy Days may be long upon the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. VI. Thou shalt not Kill. VII. Thou shalt not commit Adultery. VIII. Thou shalt not Steal. IX. Thou shalt not bear false Witness against thy Neighbour. X. Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbour's House thou shalt not cover thy Neighbour's Wife, nor his Man-servant, nor his Maid-servant, nor his Ox, nor his Ass, nor any thing that is thy Neighbour's. Quest. 3. Where is the Christian Religion most fully open∣ed, and entirely contained? Answ. In the Holy Scriptures, especially of the New Testament: Where, by Christ, and his Apostles and Evangelists, inspired by his Spirit, the History of Christ and his Apostles is ufficiently delivered, the Promises and Doctrine of Faith are perfected, the Covenant of Grace most clearly opened, and Church-Offices, Worship, and Discipline established; in the understanding whereof, the strongest Christians may increase whilst they live on Earth.
The explained Profession of the Christian Reli∣gion. I. I Believe that there is one GOD, an infinite Spirit of Life, Understanding and Will; perfectly Pow∣erful, Wise and Good; The Father, the Word,The Assent. and the Spirit, the Creator, Go∣vernour, and End of all things; our ab∣solute Owner, our most just Ruler▪ and our most graci∣ous Benefactor, and most amiable Good. II. I believe that Man being made in the Image of God, an imbodied Spirit of Life▪ Understanding and Will, with holy Viacity, wisdom and Love, to know, and love, and serve his Creator, here and for ever, did by wilful finning fall from his God, his Holiness, and Innocency, under the Wrath of God, the Condemnation of his law, and the Sla∣very of the Flesh, the World, and the Devil. And that God so loved the World, that he gave his only Son to be their Redeemer, who being GOD▪ and one ith the Father, took our Nature, and became MAN: being conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Vir∣gin Mary, called Jesus Christ, who was perfectly holy, sinless, fulfilling all▪ Righteousness▪ over came the Devil and the World, and gave himself a Sacri∣fice for our Sins, by suffering a cursed Death on the Cross, to ransom us, and reconcile us unto God▪ nd was buried, and went among the Dead; the hird Day he rose again, having conquered Death.

And having commanded his Apostles to Preach the Gospel to all the World▪
and promised his Spirit, he ascended into Heaven Where he is the Glorified, Head over all Things to the Church, and our prevailing Intercessor with the Fa∣ther: who will there receive the departed Souls of th Justified: and at the end of this VVorld will come a∣gain and raise all the Dead, and will Judge all accor∣ding to their VVorks, and justly execute his Judg∣ment. III. I believe that God, the Holy Spirit, was given the Father and the Son, to the Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, to be their Infallible Guide in Preach and Recording the Doctrine of Salvation; and the Wit∣ness of its certain Truth, by his manifold Divine Opera∣tions; and to quicken, illuminate, and sanctifie all true Believers, that they may overcome the Flesh, th VVorld, and the Devil.

Wisdom and Love; to know, and love, and serve has Maker, here and for ever: and gave him the inferiour Creatures for his use: But forbad him to eat of the Tree of Knowledge, upon pain of Death. Qu. What believe you of Man's fall into sin and misery? Ans. Man being tempted by Satan▪ did by wilful sin∣ning fall from his Holiness, his Innocency, and his Hap∣piness, under the Justice of God, the condemnation of his Law, and the slavery of the Flesh, the World, and the Devil; whence sinful, guilty and miserable Na∣tures are propagated to all Mankind: And no meer Creature is able to deliver us. Quest. 4. What believe you of Man's Redemption by Je∣sus Christ? Answ. God so loved the World, that he gave his only Son to be their Saviour: Who being GOD, and One with the Father, took our Nature, and became MAN; being conceived by the Holy Ghost; Born of the Virgin Mary; and called JESUS CHRIST: who was perfectly holy, without sin, fulfilling all Righteous∣ness; and overcame the Devil and the World; and gave himself a Sacrifice for our Sins, by suffering a Cur∣sed Death on the Cross to ransom us, and reconcile us unto God; and was buried, and went among the Dead: the third day he rose again, having conquered Death; and having sealed the New Covenant with his Blood, he commanded his Apostles and other Ministers, to Preach the Gospel to all the World; and promised the
Holy Ghost: And then Ascended into Heaven, where he is God and Man, the Glorified Head over all things to his Church, and our prevailing Intercessor with God the Father. Quest. 5.

I must not pro∣fane, but holily use his holy Name▪ I must keep holy the Lord's Day, especially in Communion with the Church Assemblies: I must Ho∣nour and Obey my Parents, Ma∣gistrates, Pastors, and other ∣lers: I must not wrong my Neigh∣bour in thought, word, or deed, in his Soul, his Body, his Chastity, Estate, Right o Propriety; but do him all the good I can▪ And do as I would be done by; which is summed up in the Ten Commandments, [God spake these words, saying, &c. A Prayer for Families in the method of the Lords Prayer, being ut an Exposition of it. MOST Glorious GOD, who art Power, and Wisdom, and Goodness it self, the Creator all things; the Owner, the Ruler, and the Benefactor of the World, but especially of thy Church and Chosen Ones: Though by sin original and actual we were thy Enemies, the Slaves of Satan and our Flesh, and under thy displeasure, and the condemnation of thy Law; yet thy Children Redeemed by Jesus Christ thy Son, and Regenerated by thy Holy Spirit, have leave to call thee their reconciled Father: For by thy Covenant of Grace thou hast given them thy Son to be their Head▪ their Teacher, and their Saviour: And in Him thou hat pardoned, adopted, and sanctified them; sealing and preparing them by thy Holy Spirit, for thy C∣lestial Kingdom, and beginning in them that holy life, and light, and love, which shall be perfected with thee in Everlasting Glory. O with what wondrous love hast thou loved us, that of Rebels we should be made the Sons of God! Thou hast advanced us to this dig∣nity,
that we might be devoted wholly to Thee as Thine Own, and might delightfully obey Thee, and entirely love Thee with all our Heart; and so might glorifie Thee here and for ever. O cause both us, and all thy Churches, and all the World, to hallow thy great and holy Name! And to to Thee as our Ultimate End; that thy shining on Holy Souls may Glorifie thy Divine Per∣fection. And cause both us and all the Earth, to cast off the Tyranny of Satan and the Flesh, and to acknowledge thy Supream Authority, and to become the Kingdom of Thee and Thy Son Jesus, by a willing and absolute subjection. O perfect thy Kingdom of Grace in our selves and in the World, and hasten the Kingdom of Glory. And cause us and thy Churches, and all people of the Earth, no more to be ruled by the Lus of the Flesh, and their Erroneous Conceits, and by Self-will, which is the Idol of the Wicked; but by thy perfect Wisdom and holy Will revealed in thy Laws: Make known thy Word to all the World, and send them the Messengers of Grace and Peace; and cause Men to understand, believe and obey the Gospel of Salvation and that with such Holiness, Unity, and Love, that the Earth, which is now too like to Hell, may made liker unto Heaven; and not only thy scattered imperfect Flock, but those also, who in their carnal and ungodly minds do now refuse a holy Life, and think thy Word and Ways too strict, may desire to imi∣tate even the Heavenly Church; where Thou art o∣beyed, and loved, and praised, with high Delight, in Harmony and Perfection. And because our Being is the subject of our well-being, maintain us in the Life which thou hast here given us, until the work of Life be finished; and give us such health of Mind and Body, and such protection and supply of all our wants, as shall best
our Duty; and make us contented with our daily Bread, and patient if we want it; And save us from the love of the Riches, and Honours, and Pleasures of this World, and the Pride, and Idleness, and Sen∣suality which they cherish; And cause us to serve thy Providence by our diligent Labours, and to serve thee faithfully with all that thou givest us; And let us not make provision for the Flesh, to satisfie its desires and lusts. And we beseech thee of thy Mercy, through the Sa∣crifice and Propitiation of thy Beloved Son, for∣give us all our sins, original and actual, from our Birth to this Hour; our omissions of Duty, and com∣mitting of what thou didst forbid: Our sins of heart, and word, and deed; our sinful thoughts and affecti∣ons, our sinful passions and discontents; our secret and our open sins; our sins of negligence, and igno∣rance, and rashness; but especially our sins against Knowledge and Conscience, which have made the deepest guilt and wounds. Spare us, O Lord, and let not our sins so find us out as to be our ruin; but let us so find them out, as truely to repent and turn to thee! Especially punish us not with the loss of thy Grace! Take not thy Holy Spirit from us, and deny us not his assistance and holy operations. Seal to us by that Spirit the pardon of our Sins, and lift up the light of thy Countenance upon us, and give us the joy of thy Favour and Salvation. And let thy Love and Mercy so fill us not only with Thankfulness to Thee, but with Love and Mercy to our Brethren and our Enemies; that we may heartily forgive them that do us wrong, as through thy Grace we hope we do. And for the time to come suffer us not to cast our selves wilfully into Temptations; but carefully to a∣void them, and resolutely to resist and Conquer what we cannot avoid; And O mortifie those inward Sins and Lusts, which are our constant and most dangerous Temptations: And let us not be tempted by Satan or
the World, or tryed by thy Judgments, above the strength which thy Grace shall give us. Save us from a fearless confidence in our own strength. And let us not dally with the snare, nor taste the bait, nor play with the Fire of thy wrath; But cause us to fear and depart from evil; lest before we are aware, we be en∣tangled and overcome, and wounded with our Guilt and with thy Wrath, and our End should be worse than our Beginning. Especially save us from those ra∣dical Sins of Error, and Unbelief, Pride, Hypocrisie, Hardheartedness, Sensuality, Slothfulness, and the love of this present World, and the loss of our love to Thee, to thy Kingdom and thy Ways. And save us from the malice of Satan and of wick∣ed Men, and from the Evils which our sins would bring upon us. And as we crave all this from thee, we humbly ren∣der our Praises with our future Service to thee! Thou art the King of all the World, and more than the Life of all the Living! Thy Kingdom is Everlasting: Wise▪ and Just, and Merciful is thy Government. Blessed are they that are thy faithful Subjects; But who hath hardened himself against thee, and hath prospered? The whole Creation proclaimeth thy Perfection▪ But it is Heaven where the Blessed see thy Glory, and the Glory of our Redeemer, where the Angels and Saints behold thee, admire thee, adore thee, love thee, and praise thee with triumphant joyful Songs, the Holy, Holy, Holy God, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, who was and is, and is to come; Of Thee, and through Thee, and to Thee are all things: To Thee, be Glory for ever, Amen. A short Prayer for Families. MOst Glorious, Ever-living God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, Infinite in thy Power, Wisdom and Goodness; Thou art the Creator of all the World,
the Redeemer of lost Mankind, and the Sanctifier of thine Elect. Thou hast made us living reasonable Soul, placed a while on Earth in Flesh, to seek, and know, and love, and serve thee, which we should have done with all our Soul and Might: For we and all things are Thine own, and Thou art more to us than all the World. This should have been the greatest Busines, Care and Pleasure of our Lives: We were bound to by thy Law, and invited by thy Love and Mercy, and the Promise of a Reward in Heaven: And in our Bap∣tism we were devoted to this Christian Life of Faith and Holiness, by a solemn Covenant and Vow. But with Grief and Shame we do confess, that we have been too unfaithful to that Covenant, and too much neglected the Lord our Father, our Saviour and our Sanctifier, to whom we were devoted; And have too much served the Flesh and the World, and the Devil which we re∣nounced. We have added to our Original Sin, the guilt of Unthankfulness for a Saviour, and resisting his Spirit and Grace that should have renewed, governed and saved us. We have spent much of our Lives, in fleshly and worldly Vanity, and finfully neglected the greatest work, of making a sure Preparation for Death and Judgment, and our endless State. In a Custom of sinning we have hardened our Hearts against thy Word and Warnings, and the Reproofs of thy Ministers, and of our Consciences that have oft told us of our Sin and Danger, and called us to Repent. And now, O Lord, our convinced Souls confess that we deserve to be forsaken by thee, and left to our own lust and folly, and to the deceits of Satan, and untoendless Misery. But seeing thou hast given a Sa∣viour to lost Man, and a pardoning Covenant, through the Merits of Christ, promising Forgiveness and Salva∣tion to every true penitent Believer; we thankfully accept thy offered Mercy, and penitently bewail our Sin, and cast our miserable Souls upon thy Grace, and the Sacrifice, Merits and Intercession of our Redeemer.
Forgive all the sins of our Hearts and Lives; and as a reconciled Father take us as thy adopted Children in Christ. O give us thy renewing Spirit, to be in us a powerful and constant Author of Holy Light, and Love and Life, to fit us for all our Duty, and for Commu∣nion with thee, and for Everlasting Life: And to dwell in us as thy Witness and Seal of our Adoption. Let him be better to our Souls than our Souls are to our Bodies, Teaching us thy Word and Will, and bringing all our love and will to a joyful compliance with thy Will: and quickening our dull  drowsie Hearts to a Holy and Heavenly Conversation. Let him turn all our sin∣ful Pleasures and Desires, into the delightful love of thee and of thy Ways and Servants. Save us from the great Sins of Selfishness, Pride, and Worldliness, and give us Self-denial, Humility, and a Heavenly Mind. That while we are on Earth our Hearts may be in Heaven, where we hope to live in thy joyfull Love and praise with Christ and all his Holy Ones for even▪ Let us never forget that this Life is short, and that the Life to come is endless: That our Souls are precious and our Bodies vile, and must shortly turn to rotten∣ness and dust; that Sin is odios, and Temptation dangerous, and Judgment dreadful to unprepaved guilty Souls; and that without a Saviour and his Grace and Spirit, there is no Salvation: Cause us to live as we would die, and let no Temptation, Company or Business, draw us to forget our God and our everlast∣ing state. Lord bless the World, and specially these Kingdoms, ith Wise, Godly, Just and Peaceable Princes, and nferiour Judges and Magistrates; and guide, protect nd prosper them for the common good, and the pro∣oting of Godliness and suppressing of sin: And bles∣ll Churches with able, godly, faithful Pastors, that are ealous Lovers of God, and Goodness, and the Peoples ouls.
