FIrst, His Maiestie doth strictly charge and command, that no dwelling Houses, Stables, Shops, Stalles, or any other building whatsoeuer, be from hencefoorth erected, or attemp∣ted to be erected, within the Citie of London, or the Suburbs thereof, or within the distance of two miles, to be taken from any gate of the said Citie, or from His Maiesties Palace at Westmin∣ster, except it be vpon the foundation of a former dwelling house, or such like Building: And if any such Building, contrary to this Prohibition, shall hereafter happen to bee begun, that the

All Houses, Sheddes, Shoppes, and other buildings, which haue been builded or set vp with∣in the limits aforesaid, at any time since the thirteenth yeere of the late King Iames, of blessed me∣mory, contrary to any Proclamation published in his late Maiesties time, shalbe forth with pulled downe, as is before directed touching other Buildings, to bee stayed or pulled downe; And no Cellars erected within the time last mentioned, to be vsed for Lodgings or Victualing houses, but the occupiers thereof to be suppressed, and so to be kept by the Iustices of Peace. That no person or persons do erect, reedifie, or set vp any House or building in London, or within the distance of three miles from any the gates of the said Citie of London, or from His Maiesties Palace at Westminster, vnlesse hee doe make all the vtter walles of the same of Bricke, or Bricke and Stone: And that all Houses and Buildings to be erected within the said Citie, or in, or adioy∣ning to any open Streete of any Towne or Village out of the said Citie, within the limits of three miles aforesaid, shall be built according to the forme and proportion hereafter in these presents expressed (viz.) euery whole Story of, and in such Houses and Buildings, and all and euery the Roumes of such whole Story, shall be of the height of Tenne foote of Assize, at the least, and euery halfe Story, of and in such houses and buildings, shall be of the height of seuen foote and a halfe, at the least; And that the forefront, and all outward, and diuision-walles, betwixt house and house, and the Iambes, heads, and soyles of the windowes, shalbe of Bricke, or of Bricke and Stone, and the windowes (beeing of timber) not to be put in, vntill the Iambes and heads a∣foresaid bee finished, and beare of themselues. And if the said buildings doe not exceed two Stories in height, then the walles thereof shall be of the thicknesse of one bricke, and halfe a brickes length, according to the assize of brickes here∣vnder mentioned, from the ground vnto the vppermost part of the said walles; And where the building shalbe of the height of three Stories, the walles of the first Story shalbe of the thicknesse of two brickes length, and from thence vnto the vppermost part of the wall, of the thicknesse of one bricke and halfe a brickes length, and so proportionably, if there shall be more Stories. That in building of the sayd houses, there shall be no Iutties, or Iutting, or Cant windowes, either vpon timber Ioists, or otherwise, but the walles to goe direct and straight vpwards, and at the setting off, a water Table to bee made; Also the Lights of the Windowes of euery whole Story, to bee of more height then bredth, to the end the Roomes may receiue ayre for health, and there may bee sufficient peeres of bricke, not lesse then halfe the bredth of the Windowes betweene them for strength; And likewise the windowes of euery halfe Story to bee made square euery way, or neere there abouts.

And, for the better encouragement of his Maiesties louing Subiects in their buildings, accor∣ding to the direction of this Proclamation, his Maiestie hath thought fit, by the aduise aforesaid, to set downe these Orders following, concerning the true making, and rating of the price of Bricke, which is one of the principall Materials, requisite for the said buildings, (Viz.) THat the earth, whereof the Bricke shall bee made, bee good and fit for that purpose: The first digging thereof to bee betweene the Feasts of Saint Michael the Archangel, and S. Thomas the Apostle; and the second digging, casting, or turning vp of the sayd earth, to be at, or before the last day of February, then following: And that no person whatsoeuer, doe presume to digge, or make any Bricke, in any place within one mile of the gates of the said Citie of London, or within one mile of his Maiesties Palace of Westminster.
That the said Earth be sufficiently and well wrought and tempered before it be moulded; And that the Bricke makers cause no Earth to be moulded for Bricke, but onely betweene the Feast of the Annunciation of the blessed Virgine Mary, and the last day of August yeerely, and at ne other time or season of the yeere. That in the moulding of the said Brickes, the moulds be throughly and well filled, and not set in the moulds, in the laying downe; And that they be sufficiently and well dried before they be put into the Kilne, and then carefully and throughly burned; So as for the assize, euery Bricke being burned, conteine in length, nine inches, in breadth, foure inches one quarter and halfe a quarter of an inch, and in thickenesse, two inches and one quarter of an inch. That the price of Brickes (being thus wrought and made in goodnesse, size, and maner, as a∣foresaid) shall not exceede the rate of eight shillings the thousand at the Kilne: And if any exces∣siue rate be demanded for the carriage of the said Brickes, from the Kilne, to the place where they shall be to be vsed, the Commissioners for Buildings to moderate the same, according to equitie, in their good discretions; And that no person or persons shall make, or cause to be made within fiue miles of any the gates of the Citie of London, nor bring by water or land, or vtter, sell, or put to sale within the said City, or any place or places within fiue miles thereof, as aforesaid, any Brickes made or wrought contrary to the directions aforesaid, nor sell the same at any higher rate, then is before mentioned. That no person or persons within the said City of London, or within two miles from any the gates thereof, or from His Maiesties Palace at Westminster, shall in defrauding the intent of this Proclamation, support or strengthen any Buildings so ruinous and olde, as are vnfit to be con∣tinued, by digging of Cellars, and bringing vp new Bricke walles, by erecting new Chimneys and Staire cases, by placing pieces of Timber, by setting on new roofes or rafters, and thrusting out of dormers, knitting and fastening together the said new additions vnto the old Timber, by barres and crampes of Iron, or other like deuices, vnlesse he or they shall be thereunto licenced and allowed by his Maiesties Commissioners for Buildings. That no person or persons within the limits last aforesaid, doe at any time or times hereafter presume or attempt to erect, couer, ouerlay or inclose any Houels, or other Sheds of Timber, with Reeds, Faggots, Hay, Straw, Boards, or other materials, or doe raise vp any Wall, Pale, or Banke of Earth, to which Sheds may be added, or doe repaire or new make into the streets, any maner of Bulkes, Stalles, Windowes, Doores, or other offensiue issues, Or doe alter or change the vse of any dwelling House, or other Building, to any more noysome, or offensiue vse, end or pur∣pose, then the same was imployed before the time of the demolishing or altering the same, with∣out the speciall Licence and Allowance of the said Commissioners for Buildings. And for that the diuiding of Houses into seuerall Tenements and habitations, and the letting part of Houses and Chambers to Inmates, and Vnder-sitters, is no lesse inconuenient then ex∣cessiue Buildings, as well in regard of surcharge of people, especially of the worse sort, and for breeding and spreading of Infection, as otherwise, His Maiesty hath also by the aduice aforesaid, commanded these Articles following to be duely obserued: THat no person or persons within the City of London, or two miles from any the gates thereof, doe diuide any dwelling House by Lease, sufferance, or otherwise, into, or for any more Tene∣ments or dwellings, then are at this present, or haue been heretofore vsed within the same, by the space of thirtie yeeres last past. That no person doe hereafter receiue into any House, any Inmates or Vnder-sitters, or any more families then one. That no person or persons, who shall erect a new House vpon, or within the Precincts of an olde Foundation, shall diuide the same into more Tenements, or seuerall dwellings, then were vsed in the said former Houses. By the due obseruation of which seuerall Articles, as the vniformitie of the Buildings will bring much honour to the City, and grace and ornament both to the Streets thereof, and to the neighbour Townes; So the Building with Bricke or Stone will be more durable and more safe from the danger and casualties of fire, and withall, the reducing of all sorts of Houses to this order, and the present remoouing of Inmates and Vnder-sitters, according to this Direction, will in short time discontinue, and take away the many Cottages, Sheds, and base places of ha∣bitation
in by-lanes and backe-streets, whereby the City, Suburbs, and Confines will become more sutable, and lesse subiect to that danger of Sickenesse and Infection, which by the vnwhole∣some pestering of multitudes of poore people together, is now threatned against the same. And therefore His Maiesty, vpon mature and deliberate consideration taken of the premisses, Doeth straitly charge and command, all and euery person or persons of whatsoeuer degree, qua∣litie, or condition hee or they be, That hee, they, and euery of them, doe well and truely obserue and keepe all and singuler the Articles before specified, in all things to them respectiuely belon∣ging, as they will auoid his Maiesties high displeasure, and such further penalties and punish∣ments, as their contempts and neglects herein shall demerit, and by his Maiesties Prerogatiue Royall, or otherwise, may be inflicted vpon them. And because the life of all good Constitutions and orders, standeth in the quicke and due execu∣tion of them, as His Maiesty, out of his further Princely care and desire to haue this good worke prosper and proceed according to his Maiesties most gracious intention, Hath chosen and appoin∣ted certaine of the Lords of His Priuie Councell, and others, Gentlemen of qualitie, to be His Commissioners, to take speciall care of the same, and to see this His Royall pleasure, so much concerning the publique good, to be duely executed and performed; So His expresse charge and commandement is, aswell to the said Commissioners, as to the Lord Maior, Recorder, and Al∣dermen of the said City of London, and all Iustices of Peace within the Counties of Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and Surrey, and all High Constables, pettie Constables, Headboroughes, and other Offi∣cers, to whom it may appertaine, That they and euery of them in their seuerall places and offi∣ces, respectiuely, doe diligently and duely attend to giue their vttermost aide, helpe, and assistance, according to their duties concerning the premisses: And where they, or any of them shall finde any offence to be committed against any Branch or Article of this Proclamation, to make certi∣ficate thereof to the Lords of Our Priuie Councell, whom Wee require to vse all fitting care, pro∣uidence and endeauour, to correct and reforme the same, or else to giue speedy notice thereof in wri∣ting, to Our Attourney generall, whom Wee doe hereby command and authorize, to prosecute and proceed against all, and euery the offender and offenders aforesaid, in the said Court of Star-chamber, That by the Sentence of that High and Honourable Court, they may be better taught to know, and to doe their duties, and both themselues and others by their example, be brought to that conformitie, which His Maiestie expecteth and requireth. Giuen at the Court at White-Hall, the second day of May, in the first yeere of His Maiesties Reigne of Great Britaine, France, and Ireland. God saue the King. ¶ Printed at London by Bonham Norton and Iohn Bill, Printers to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. M.DC.XXV.
