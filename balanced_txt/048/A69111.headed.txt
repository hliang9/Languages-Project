The seconde is by cause that olde Age makyth men feble. seekly and foryetefulle. The thirde cause is for as moche that olde age takyth away fro men alle delectacyons and pleasurs naturelle as sensualitees in getyng of chyldern. The iiij reason is by cause that

neuerthelesse that lackyng comith more ofter by the vices & outragyousnes of yong age than it comith by the vi∣ces of olde age / ffor the age of adolescencye outragyo{us} & euill disposid / & intemperat / yeldith & causith the bodi to be feble & vnweldy in olde age / ffor where as Cirus kyng of perse was full olde / he cōfessid by his worde that he hadd / at the tyme of his deth / that he felt not / nor neuir percey∣uid / that he was in any wise become olde by cause of olde age / nomore than he was in adolescence as tellith an his∣toryographe a cronicler callid Exenophon / I remēbre me that when I was a childe I sawe an olde man consul ro∣mayn callid Lucius metellus / sithen that he had be iiij yere the chief of the bisshoppis of rome aftir that he had be¦twies consul / he was hool̄ & vygorus in vndirstondyng & he duellid in that dignyte of souerayn bisshop by xxij yere & in so good strengthis he lyued / to the laste ende of his age / that he ne required nor desired neuir te retourne ageine to the state & age of adolescēcye / It nedith not to me for to saye any thyng of my silf how be it that this boke that we make is the werke & processe of recomendyng of olde age & which apperteyneth to our age that be olde men as be they of whom we haue spokyn / Ye also may see how Nestor one of the kyngys of grece techid & enfourmed / & sett before the exsamples of his wisedomes & vertues in a boke that Omer the poete made of ye batayle of troye / Nes¦tor at that tyme when he prechid & taught his vertues was thēne in the thirde age of man for he was vppon an hun¦dird yeris & yit he made no doubte but in recomēdyg hym silf / he semid to be full arogaūt & auaūtyng & neuertheles he recomendith not onely hym self / but the poete Omer
hym preyseth also of his grete vertues / ffor certeynly seid Omer of the tongue of olde kyng Nestor stilled & droppid a langage swetter than hony / and for to speke that of his swetnesse of langage the seid kyng ne∣did not of strength of body / and neuirthelesse the kyng Agamenon duke & leder of the batayle of grece ayenst the troyens askid / neuir ne requyred / to the goddys im∣mortell / that he myght haue x such knyghtys as was the yong / Ayax by cause that Agamenon myght the rathir discomfite the troyens / But the duke Agame∣non askith & requireth to the goddys that he myght haue vj such olde men as was that kyng Nestor & Agame∣non said / that yf he myght haue vj / such olde men / he doub¦tyd not but within short tyme troye shulde be takyn & des¦troyed / But in leuyng to speke of myself that am of thage of ffourscore & iiij yeris / and forsoth I wolde that I myght magnifye & auaunt my self of that same thyng / wherof Cirus kyng of perse glorifieth & vauntyth hym / saying of hym self / that he felte neuir nor parceyued that he was in any wise become feble by cause of olde age / no∣more thāne he was in his adolescencye / But algatys I say this of myself / that nowe I am not of such strēgth as that I was at that tyme whēne I was knyght in the batayle punike in aufrik / or at that tyme whanne I was consul in spayne or foure yere aftir that I was tribun of the romaynes knyghtys & fought nych to the moūtaynes callid thermophiles that departen the perces from the gre¦kys / & at that tyme whan marcus attilius regulus was consul / But as ye see Scipion & Lelius / olde age hath not enfeblid me of all & wastid my body / and also ye see
that the court & the parlement of the senatours askith not nor desiren my bodily strengthis / that is for to vndirstōde but for to coūseill the thyngys & the causes publikes / for ye comon profite which concernyth the comon welfare of the cyte to be wele guyded / hit nedith not to the expedicyon of the thyngys that I be strong of body / but onely it suffi∣seth that I be prudent & temperate / Iuste & strong in coura¦ge / also the seeges of the auditoryes of the Iuges which I occupye & excercise requyren / & demāde not that I be stron¦ge of body / nor my frendys nor my seruaūtys / ne tho that occupye & haūten myne house / asken not that I be strong of body / for withoute any grete strength I may doo my de¦uoire to spede them / And knowe ye Scipion that I neuir conscented to an olde prouerbe / that many men appro¦uen & cōmende / which amonyssheth & signifieth that thou be comyst olde hastli yf thou wilt long be olde but I had / lyner that I were not olde than I were olde / or I shulde be / by naturell age And forsoth there is no man that myght yit / take or saye ayenst me how I haue ben occupied & as saied to be olde / or I shuld haue it aftir cours of nature / & true it is that I haue lesse strength of body / thēne ony of you tweyne / And also non of you two haue the strength of this captayne romayne callid Titus poncy¦us / and how be it that the seide Titus haue gretter strength than any of you two / yit he is not therfor stron∣ger in vertu by cause that any man ougth to be repu∣ted and accomptyd / for strong / It suffisith onely that in hym be temperaunce of strength / That is to witt that he vndirtake not the thyng which he may not
perfourme / And also it must nedys be that euery man enforce hym and putt hym in deuoire to begynne that thyng whiche he may perfourme / and yf euery man will tempre & modre his strength so as I haue saide / he shall haue grete desyre & plesire in his strength as I shall she∣we you by thexsample folowyng / The worthy knyght Hercules and also the men of grece ordeyned / from iiij / to iiij yeris in the montayne of Olymphus the highest of the worlde Iustyngys turnementys & wrestlynges in the worship of their god Iubiter / Thēne it fortuned / yt a champyon callid Milo of crotoyne came in to the place & in the cyrcuyte wherupon men made thies playes / he bare as men sayne a beef callid an oxe vpon his shulders by the space of an hundird paces / So I question the Scipion which strēgth haddist thou leuer to haue eyther the strēgth or the witt of the philosopher Pytagoras / or the strength of the seid Milo / ffinally I tell the thou owhtist vse of the bodily strengthis whiche is oon of the goodys of nature in the meane tyme whan thou haste them / But whan the goodys of bodily strength ben nomore in the / thenne thou shuldist not require it nor aske it sa∣ue that thou maist saye parauenture that the adolescen∣tys which ben in the third age owghten to desyre & aske aftir the age of pueryce which is seconde age / & by that he is the ferthir from deth / Therfor I tell the Scipion / that whan men ben somwhat entrid & come within adolescence / which is an age fructuouse and profitable / they to require it and to aske it / And not puerice callid Childhode whiche is withoute auaile and profite The cours and
the weye of age is certeyne and determyned by nature / whiche hathe onely awey which is symple & is nothyng different more in the one than in the othir / But ech̄ goo by that symple and determyned / wey aftir the degrees in their cours from the one age in to that other / And yit nature had yeuen to euery part of age his owne propre sea∣son and tyme / and hir partynent cours of vsage in kyn∣de / That is to witt / that sekenesse and maladye is pro∣pryd to the age of puerice in childhode / & cruelte is appro∣prid to the age of yongth / worshipfulnesse and sadnesse of maners be appropryd to the age of virilite whiche is is the fyfthe age / Moderaunce and temperaunce be pro∣pred to olde age / Eueriche owith to haue sumwhat natu¦relly and appropred vnto that / whiche may be gadird in his tyme I wolde Scipion that thou woldist geue me audience / & I shall tell the what thyng did olde Masimis¦sa one of the kyngys of auffryk / whiche was oure ene∣my and also he whiche was Lelyus felowe / whenne thou foughtist and discomfitist in bataile Siphar / the kyng of Munyde / This Masimissa which̄ was of age xxiiij ye∣ris whēne he begāne to walke on fote / he wolde not skipp on horsbak / & when̄e he rode an hors bak / he wolde not lyght downe during all that voiage / he was neuir constrayned for to keuir his hede / for any rayne nor for any wynde or wedyr were it neuer so colde / This olde Masimissa had in hym a souerayne dryenesse & leenesse / & also he fulfillid & mayteyned all souerayne officis & all noblenesse partey¦ning vnto a noble courte & to ryall puissaūce / that is to witt to be a tresorer a countroller and a steward orels a
Graunt maystir in a kyngys or in a pryncys court / By this thenne apperith that the excercitacion / the frequen∣tacion and the attemperaunce that a man kepith in his yong age / may kepe in olde age / sumparte of the auncient strength which was before in the body Some may op∣pose me / that in olde age ther be no strengthis / and I an¦swere to that / ther is noon olde man that askith to olde any strengthe or any werke that be doon by strength / By this apperith thēn that aftir lawe Ciuile and aftir auncient ordenaunces by statutes & custumes of a londe / oure olde age ought to be besyed / occupyed / and medeled / with publike offices of dignitees or pryuees / as to be counseillours and gouernours of cytees and townes / so that they be suche / that men may excercise them withoute bodily strength / And by that we olde men be not onely free to doo that / whych we may not / neithir we namely be constreyned to doo asmuche as we myght doo / But Scipion thou myghtist oppose me ayenst olde age / that some olde men ben so feble that they shuld not mowe exe∣cute nor doo ony publique office of dignyte or pryue per∣teynyng to his lyuyng / I answere the that this vice is not propird to olde age / but is to comon vices of se∣kenes and of nonpower of feblenesse of body Thenk Scipion how feble was Publyus affricans sone / whiche brought the vp and adopted the as his sone Thenk how by a lytle sykenesse he was enfeblid / whiche and hit had not be come vnto hym / he shuld haue be the seconde named in prowesse and renōme in actys of mar∣cialle causes aftir the noble ffabyus for the sone of
Publius ouircame & in renome surmounted his ffadir by Iustice & rightwisnes & science vsyng / wherof he had the more in his courage to mynystre & excercise Ther is no merueil thenne yf olde men be somtyme sekely and feble / fith that it was so that they of adolescentys a∣ge / and namely yong men may not eschewe sekenesse of body / Therfor I telle you Scipion and lelyus that men must resiste to olde age by cause that they myght es∣chewe and putt away dissolucion slouthe and ydeluesse by diligent labour and studye / And men must in lyke wise by excercitacion and by studye fight ayenst olde a∣ge by cause that it falle not by no vicious lyuyng / lyke as by prouisions and remedye of good dyetyng / men fyght and perserue them ayenst sekenes of body / Ol∣de men owen to haue in olde age suche conduyte guydyng and mesure by moderate excercise of laboure / as seke men vse to haue / therfor it must be auysed that olde men vsen of smale and lyght excercitacions and of temperat la∣bours / Hit must also be counseilde that olde men ete and drynke meetes of lyght and good digestion / so that the strengthis and the bodily vertues be replete and sus∣yned and not stoppid / by surfetes of hard metys or by surfete of drynkys / And hit nedith muche more to so∣cour and helpe to the thought and passion of the soule & to the courage of olde men / by cause that by the socour that he dooth to suche thoughtys and the mynde of good remembraunce faile nor lessith not / and that be he coura∣ged / as he may excercise & occupye hym in the thyngys parteynyng to olde age / ffor as the light of a lampe
quenchith & dieth / but men putt in sum oyle / to the quan∣tite that it lessith / So the thought in which is the myn∣de of man & the courage of hert / wherin is the wisedome / reste stynte and faile / but yf they be socourd with such com¦fortable thyng of pleasyre / and comfortable excercitacōns of mery communycacyons as is in recordyng & redyng the bookys of vertu / and connyng in cronycles and histo¦ryes of their noble predecessours and bryng them so ayen to more parfite remembraunce aftir that men haue redd them / And it is certeyne / that as their bodyes so aa∣ged ben woxen / greuid and wery by payne & labour / So their courages ben susteyned / and releuid by excercitaci / on of vse of studye of memory and mynde keepyng / ffor whanne Cecylius the poete in a comedy of a me¦ry boke of his saith that olde men ben sottys callid / o∣thirwise foolys / for he seith that olde man withoute exce∣citacyon of redyng or heryng good historyes / they be dis∣posid lyghtly to beleue alle the thyngys or tales thowh they be not profitable to them that they here saye / by cause that they haue no demyng in them / and also they be for∣ged fulle by repleccyon of colde & fleumatike humours / and the more by cause that they haue not excercised in a∣ge the vertu of remembraunce / and also they ben noyous and daungerous straunge for to please withoute hauyng of moderacion and temperaunce by cause of weykenesse of their complexion / ben disposed / more to sekenes thenne they were in yongth Thies thre sekenesses come not to a man by cause of olde age / but they ben the vices of the nature of olde neclygent age / as is slouth and slepe /
And as to wantōnesse / & flesshely delectacōn it is more the vice of yong men thenne of olde men / and also wan∣tōnesse is not onely the vice of adolescente men / but it is the uice of euyll disposed adolescent persones / and such aged fooly whiche men callyn oute of reson mysrulyd or sotted at some seasons / whiche condicion comyth to som olde men Hit comith to suche olde men that were light of courage in their yongth / and were not stable in wisedome nor in studye / Appius of whom I haue spokyn before was a worshypfull preest of the temple of the goddys of Minerua / he beeyng blynde and olde gouerned his foure sonys / whiche were full growen and strong men / and his fyue doughtirs and a grete houholde and grete feliship he kept wyth ontyn any help / & without counseill saue o∣nely of hymself / This Appius had his courage lent and geuen to wisedome and to good memorye as it had be aboue / and to whom the bodily strengthys failed / yit he was neuir submyttid to olde age / but he entendid to study and to publyke besynes and pryue / as in geuyng good aduices & counseill to such as had Rule and gouernaunce of / to mynistre Iustice & in keepyng good housholde / Ap¦pius olde and blynde helde souereyn rule and domyna∣cion had vpon his subiectys and seruauntis / for they bare hym reuerence and doubted his puissaunce / his seruaun∣tys drede hym / his childerne obeyed hym / and alle tho that haunted hym louid hym / & had hym in grete worship & fauour / and this Appius was of courage vigorouse / & as a man geuen to grete watche as it was in his ffa∣der / and also he had and vsed the doctryne of hym
Therfor I telle you Scipion and Lelius that the olde man is to be pleasid / and with honeste to be reueren∣ced / so that he defende hym with the yefte and tresours of memorye / by studye and by exsamples / by auctorite by re∣uerence and by the othir armes of vertues lyuyng and of sciences / Olde age is honeste yf it holde and kepe his dyuyne lawe / by whiche it is withdrawen for haboun∣donyng and withdrawyng from takyng hym self to vi∣ces if it be wele fornysshed and supportid to his trouth and complexion by whiche he lyuith aftir temperaunce & reason / The olde man is honest and good if he make hym gouernour and enfourmer of his childeren & of his mayne & seruauntes vnto the laste ende of his lif aftir his auctorite & to his puissaunce / fforsoth so as I approue and preyse the adolescent man / whiche hath in hym som thyng parteynyng to olde age as is temperaunce and so∣birnesse / Also I comende & preyse the olde man which in hym hath somthyng parteynyng to yongth / as is som strength of body and constaunce of good courage The man that folowith that / whiche I haue aboue sayde he may be olde of body / but he shall neuir be olde of courage to ex∣cercyse good deedys / I Caton whiche am olde haue nowe betwix my handys the vij book wherin I trete the birthis of the auncyent people of renomme of ytayle / In this book I gadir to gedir all recordable processe of eue∣ery noble cause that I haue purposid / and studied sor to please by aduocacye before the senatours and othir Iu∣ges of rome that is to witt / like a seriaunt of the lawe or the kyngys promoter or speker of his parlement or

I say thēne that it is more ioyfull thyng to desyre not the delectacyons / than it is for to haue them / but if the age of good and honest yongth vse of thies delectacyons / it is vsed more gladly first of som litle and smale delec∣table thynges as we haue saide here before / And aftir that the good yong men delited / them in this honeste de∣lectacyon / wherin olde age vseth not habondauntly and playnly of bodily delites / yit be they / not all for that pry∣ued nor for boden therof / as ye may see by this forsaide ex∣sample Ther is a man at rome callid Turpis Albi∣nius whiche pleyeth and counterfetyth the pagentys / when the poetys syngen enterludes in playes or tragedyes of soroufull lamentacyons / or othir ditees in verses / in the place callid the scene or the teatre / the tent or pauily∣on / he than whiche is in the first stage nygh the pleyar / hath grete delectacyon in the wordys & in the countenaunce of the pleyar / But also he deliteth theryn that is in the la¦ste stage and in the ferthist of the tente or playng place / Also I tell the Scipion that the age of adolescency∣e whiche lokith nygh the delectacyons / gladith parauen∣ture more than anothir age dooth But also olde age which seeth from ferre the delectacyons / he takith a delite in it / asmuche as it suffiseth / But and ye aske / what arn worth the yong delectacyons that olde age takith / and whiche be so ferr from the body / I answere you that thies smale pleasurs deliten not the body / but they deliten the courage whiche is the moost excellent part of a man / The smale honeste delectacions as olde men saye / ma∣ken the courage to be myghtyer and to lyue lenger and

arn sett the trees of dyuers kyndes and frutys I shall telle you vppon that / my sentence in short wordes / Ther is no thyng that may be more plenteuous nor more ha∣bondaunt in vsage for the prouffite to a mānys lyuyng / nor any thyng more semblable to naturelle beaute and fairnes / than is a cloos of frutys wele tillyed and labou∣red / Olde age lettyth not to laboure wele a cloos plan∣ted with fruytes of dyuers kyndes / for their sustenaunce / But namely olde age sterith and yeuith courage to the olde man for to laboure wele the londe / ffor syth that in wynter tyme the olde man labourer may as redely for his helth and comfort warme hym to the sōne shynyng vpon the erthe / or at the fyre / whiche is a thyng more co∣uenable to olde age / than to any othir age / Or sith that the olde man labourer may withdrawe hym to the shado∣wes / or for to fynde the heete / or for to fynde the colde / or that in somer tyme he may refresshe hym with watirs or othirwise more sykyrly / than the yong man whiche hath his hote blode boyllyng / I say that delectacyon sterith and yeuith courage to the olde man to laboure in the londes / Thenne ye Scipion and Lelius may not saye the contrarye / but yong men haue for them for theyr solas & worship / their armours / their horsys / their speris / pollaxis mallys / and Instrumentys of iren / or of leed / and laun∣cegayes for to fyght / And also maryners in vsyng the see / and yong men deliten in shippys bargys of dy∣uers fassions and in rowynges and in sayllyng in wa∣tirs and ryuers and in the sees / and som yong men vsen the cours of voyages in gooyng rydyng and iourneyeng
from one counttre to anothir / and emong many othir labours of playes sportys and of dyuers solacys / The yong men also / leuyn to the vse of olde men / the playe at the tablis and chesse / and the philosophers playe by nom∣bre of arsmetrike as is made mencion in the boke of O∣uide de vetula callid the reformacion of his life / But we demaunde the Caton / if the olde men may goodly vse and when we be olde of thies two said playes of the ta∣blis and chesse / I answere you nay / for withoute thies two playes ol̄de age may wele be stuffid and fulfillyd of alle othir goodnes perteynyng to felicite and to blessid∣nesse / Now it is so that olde age and yche othir age vsyng of discression ought not to doo any thyng / but that it drawe and be longe to vertues and to blessidnesse in stede of playes at tables and at chesses / Ye Scipi∣on and Lelyus may rede the bookys of the philosopher xenophon / whiche be right prouffitable to many thynges And I pray you that ye wille rede them so as ye do nowe al redy / and rede diligently howe Xenophon prayseth moche to labourage of londes in a book of his named the book of Economike / wherin he declareth how the man ought to gouerne kepe & approwe his owne propre lon∣dys and goodys / And to thentent that ye vndirstonde the somme of the seid booke / whiche the philosopher Xe∣nophon made / Knowe ye he saith / that to noble & pui∣ssant men in worship & to rialle astates / ther is nothyng so worthy nor so welbecomyng them / as is the studye and the crafte for to laboure and approwe the londys to be plenteuouse / for the life of a labourer as it is said / is like
the life of a philosopher / in so moche as he serchith and enquereth the causes naturell whereby the londe thorugh burgenyng myght be fertile and plenteuouse / and also his laboure is continuell and proffitable to alle creatures and so it ought to be of euery kyng and prynce and othir states of noblesse / and yit ther is no crafte nor any wer∣ke so leefulle nor so honest to a kyng or to a souerayne / as is to prouide and ordeyne the labourage of the feel∣dys / for namely in bataile the handys of a labourer be more harder and stronger to endure / than of ony othir man / The ph̄ilosopher Socrates in one of his bokys in whiche he spekith with the poete Tritobolus / seith that litil Cirus kyng of peere was excellent in witt and glo∣riouse in erthly lordshipps / In the tyme of that kyng Ci¦rus / a man of the cytee of lacedomone in grece callid li∣sander / wh̄iche was a man of right grete vertue and no∣blenes came in an ambassade for to see the same kyng Ci∣rus / at that tyme beeyng at sardes his cytee / to whom Li∣sander brought clothes of golde & riche Iewelles from the lacedomonies and from the cytees adioynant that were of his feliship / And Socrates said that this kyng Cirus was fulle benyngne and curtays to the seid Lisander to come to his noble presence / and resceyued hym worshipfully and liberally in his rialle palais / and for his moste rialltee in suche richessis that he delited most in / not in tresour of golde of precious stones ne of othir grete richesse that he had grete plentee / he delited not therin / but in the richesse of tyllyng and labourages of londys and fruytes of trees of dyuers kyndes he shewed
hym a cloos wallid all aboute diligently and connyngly laboured / tylled / planted / and sett with trees of dyuers fruytes beryng / where as Lisander merueilled hym of the length & bewte of the trees & for their right renges planted and keepyng a mesurable ordre in dymencyon / whiche trees were sett fyue fote one from anothir / and also Lisander merueilde hym of the aleyes and wal∣kyng places and the grounde of that cloos was so wele pared / doluyn and made clene / sett / and planted / with her∣bys of dyuers kyndes of swete flauours and odours ex∣cellent of beautes in leuis flouris / and colours / for the softnesse & the swetnesse of aromatique sauours came oute of the floures of dyuers kyndys / as of violettys rosemarynes maiorons / gylofres / basiles lillium conualli∣um &c. / He said to the kyng Cirus that he meruei∣lid not onely ffor the diligence and studye of hym that had labourde it / But he namely merueilid of the subtilite and craft of hym whiche had compassed and ordeyned by due mesure the settyng and plantyng of the trees of that cloos / Thēne kyng Cirus answerd to Lisander / forsoth said he / I haue myself ordeyned and mesured alle thies thynges of this cloos / and also I haue compassid and proporcioned the renges of them / and many also of theis trees that ye see here / be sett and greffid with myne owne handys / And Socrates tellith that Lisander in loo∣kyng vpon the gowne of purpure of kyng Cirus / and the clene beaute and goodlynes of his body / and the array whiche he bare in the maner and wise accustomed of the countree of Perse / whiche was weuid with golde
thyk / and with manye precious stonys garnysshid and richely couchid / and purposed in thies wordes to kyng Cirus / fforsoth said Lisandre / men seyen rightfully & truly that thou art riche and fortunat happye and blessid in thy life / for to thy vertue & nobilnes roiall is conioy∣ned to gedir fortune and wordly felicitee / by cause that thou employest the and occupyest to laboure the feeldys to be riche and plenteuouse / wherin is the pryncipall parte of worldly blessidnesse / Sith than that of thies for∣tune and blessid disposicion whiche kyng Cirus thēne olde / myght lefully vse and worke in londys tyllyng / and that he delited hym therin to make his reame plentefull and riche / I tell you Scipion and lelius that it is leefull to the olde aged men of high astate as of othir meane degree / to vse and to take delectacion in labouryng the londes / and yit it is true that olde age lettith not / but yeuith olde men myght to maynten contynewe and per∣fourme vnto thende of our age the studye and by coun∣seyllyng the offices of dyuers craftes of all thynges to be wrought and to be doon and specyally in labouryng of londys / ffor forsoth I haue herd saye by the olde historyographes / that a noble olde man romayne callid / Ualerius Carninus vsed the life of a labourer vnto an C yere of his age / and all though he were of long & of parfyte age / neuirthelesse he dwellid in opyn townys and in villages and laboured the landes Betwixt the first office geuen hym in rome and the sixt consulat of this Ualerius was xlvj yeris by reuolucyon of yeris / and anon aftir that same tyme he was Iuged to be an
olde man / And by that grete age / he was named vnable to haue publike office of rule and gouernaunce of citees and townes or for to be a capitaigne to make werre for the defence of the romayns / But which men may vndir∣stonde that aftir the nombre of yeris that auncien men ordeyned / which was from childehode vnto the begynnyng of olde age / men myght endure tyll that same nombre of auncien yeris to haue offices and dignitees in rome / ffor olde age beganne aftir the ordenaunce of the romaynes and not aftir the nombre of yeris / and forsoth the laste age of this valerius was more bettir and more blessid / by cause that it had more auctorite and experience in the offi∣ce of labourage of approwmentys of manoirs feldes and lordships / Yf ye question how I preue that auctorite / by the most high thyng that olde age myght haue his verry experience and excercise / Ye knowe it wele Inough in cōsideryng what was that olde man romayne Lucius Metellus the most grete bisshop of rome whiche by his grete auctorite and wisedome defended Postumius con∣sul of rome / that he shulde not goo for to make werre in aufryk / in leuyng the sacrifises in the olde lawe deputed and accustumed of Mars god of bataile / wherof it for∣tuned that the seid Postumius in obeyng to the auctori∣te of Lucius metellus the bisshop left the seid entrepris of his werre makyng though it had be committed to Postumyus as consul of rome / Ye also may knowe how grete the auctorite had be of olde men by the same that was subduyd in the noble romayne Actilius Catilinus / whiche was the prynce and lorde of the people

oon of my sentencys / to the whiche all the philosophers of rome accorded / The whyte herys and the ryuilyng chier of the body of an olde man may not wynne soden∣ly auctorite nor worship / but the age passed / before the olde age / takith his lafte fruytes of auctorite / That is to witt / that the vertues and the sciences of the yong men resceyuen not hole worship nor full auctorite till olde age come on hym / that his wittys bee stablisshed by / fforsoth ther be seuen thyngys perteynyng to the worship of olde age / whiche semytth to som men to be light and cōmune / by cause that they belongen to all good olde men / whiche ben thies / The first is that it perteyneth that the othir yong men all be it they be grete in dignite to salewe and make reuerence in all places to the olde man / men ought desire the felisihp of the olde man for to lerne of hym and to haue his counseille / Men ought in euery place to yeue rowme & audyēce to the olde man in the felishipps where men treten and comenyn of publike offices vpon maters for a comon prouffite or a pryue / that be syngler causes to be decysed / Men ought to rise sone anone before the ol∣de man and bowe them in obeyng hym / Men ought to fo∣lowe and goo honorably and worshipfully aftir the olde man fauoure and abyde hym when it nedith / Men ought to lede and guyde them honestly / and bryng them ayen from the places that olde men haue for to tarye / Men ought to demaūde question and enquere of the olde man coūseill & aduise vpon chargeable maters and doubtouse thyngys for to witt whiche be for to doo and whiche be for to leue / And all thies worships belongen to olde
men / whiche be full dylygently kept / emonge vs roma∣ynes / and also in other citees townes and villages af∣ter that whiche be right wele founded and grounded in good condicions and the same custumes duly obserued The historyes of the greekys sayne that the wise man Lisander of the kyngdome of lacedomonye in greece of whom I haue nowe late made nencōn / where he was wont for to say that the cytee of lacedemone was the right ho∣nest toure or dongeon or castell of olde age / That is to witt / In the cyte of lacedomone olde men resceyued right grete worship and right grete auctorite in dignite / ffor in no place saue there / men made not somuche worship to olde age and was not more honourid and worshiped / than it was in the seid cyte of lacedomone othir wise named spar∣ta / And knowe ye Scipion and lelius that we re∣membre wele that oute of the cytee of Athenys was co∣me theder aged men of worship and degree for to see ga∣mes and playes / Ther was no man of all the cytezeyns sittyng and stondyng in that grete place that wolde ge∣ue place and rowme to the olde men of Athenys for to sett them to be holde and see the playes / Thenne thies olde men consyderyng that noon of cytezeins had not made them no place / they withdrewe them a parte from the Teatre callid the Tent and stages where as there sate in a certeyne place ordeyned some men of the cytee of La¦cedomone / whiche were come vnto Athenys as legates callid Ambassiatours / and the historyes sayne that alle the men of lacedomone ariseden from their sieges and re∣sceyued the seid olde men for to sett the same olde men by
them / And aftir that they / whiche sate in the tentys had right gretly preysed and recomended the men of lace∣domone / whiche had yeuen place to the seid olde men / And oon of the men of lacedomone said heeryng them that were there / fforsooth said he the men of athenys knowyn suche thynges of reuerence and / honour belongyng to be doon aftir right and gentilnes / but they will not doo it / O ye men of lacedomone I come to speke of you for I haue knowyn that in your company and feliship / and in your college be many thynges right noble and worthy to be tolde of and putt in remembraūce / But the honoure and worship due and belongyng vnto olde age / wherof I spe∣ke nowe is founde pryncipally in your feliship / for aftir that euery man hath more in age emongys you men of lacedomone / he is holden and take for the pryncipalle / and the first place to hym assigned in the assembles and in places and publike counseils / and yeuyth first the sen∣tences vpon the causes questioned wherof men spekyn and come to be counseylde vpon the dygnyte / And the reuerence and the religyon be so straytly kept emong the men of lacedomony / that not onely the olde men be set before them whiche be in worship and dignite / But namely the bisshops and prestis more aged be sett before the Emperours and pryncys lesse aged / Nowe may ye knowe that men of bodily delectacy∣ons ought not to be compared with the rewardes of auc∣torite of worshyp / whiche is due and yelden to olde age and if som haue to gretly vsed of this bodily delectacōns
wherof I complayne me / It seemith me that they haue not perfourmed their age / but it owght to be tolde for a mok / and for a fable / by cause that in their life dayes they haue made no prouffitable thyng vaillable to endure by them / whiche ouer muche haue vsed of thies delectacyons tom∣blyn and falle in their laste age / That is to wit in olde age which is to vndirstonde / not as Iouglers mynstrels and players turnyn and tomblyn vp so downe in the last ende of their playes of maistryes for disport makyng by the whiche they ought lightly to be excused / But the men whiche so long haue vsed / of delectacyon that they leue it but as a fable and a vnyte / They ought to haue no mercy nor be excused / But some may telle me that ol∣de men be slowe and soft / angwisshous / and heuy / angry and soroufulle / variant and mystrustyng / and if we seke wele the condicions of olde men / we shall fynde as ye say / that they be also nygardes and couetouse / But I answe∣re you Scipion and Lelyus / that their vices whiche ye name here aboue / be the vices of the condicions of cor∣rupt & euill custumes / and be not the vices aftir age / But algatis this euill slownesse of body & the othir vi∣ces that I haue said whiche semyn to be foūde in olde age haue apparaūce of some excusacyon whiche forsoth is not Iuste / But it is suche that it seemyth that men may preue that it be reasonable / Men may yit oppose me that olde men trowyn and ymagyne to be dispraysed and moc∣ked of yong men / And with that alle office and euery dyspleasyre be hatefulle to olde age / by cause that olde men haue their bodyes freel and sekely / by whiche
they may suffre noon offenses of displeasir nor wrethfull But I tell you Scipion & Lelius / that though ol∣de men weenyn to be dispraised and mocked and offended of yong men whiche thynges arn dyuers & hatefull to ol∣de men / Neuirtheles if they be purueid of good condici∣ons and vertues & of good sciences as they ought to be the thyngys aforesaid shal seeme them swete and light to bere and to suffre / ffor though the mynde be purueid of good condicions and vertues and of good sciences / it may not be so harde offended nor troubled / but it appeaseth and swetith it holdyng hym content and pleased / as so∣ne as it thenkith and remembrith the propre goodnes that it hath in it silf / But and the olde men be not wele drawyn foorth in connyng and manerly taught and wise / the euil condicions hereaboue reherced shuld be to them harde noyous & hatefull / & parauenture importable & it is not merueil though some olde men suffryn & heeryn wele & softly the greuaunces of olde age / And that some arn inportune & wery of age / ffor we may rede and see like thyng in the lyuyng & the condicōns of two bretheren ge∣mellys callid twynlynges / wherof the poete Trecencius made a comodye callid aelphis / the which he redde in the scene at rome / ffor of thies two bretheren gendird of oon ffadir in oon bely at onys norisshed / the oon like as the othir / the one was hard sharp angry vngracious & rude / And the othir was curteys meke honeste and debonaire / Than knowe ye Scipion and lelius that suche is the ordenaunce of the custumes of olde age / ffor as e∣uery wyne long kept and olde waxith not eagre of
his owne propre nature / right so all mankynde is not ay∣gre fell cruell vngracious chargyng nor inportune in ol∣de age of their owne kynde / though some men among ma∣ny be foūde of that condicōn / I approue & preyse in olde age the man which hath seueritee & stidfast abydyng in hym / seuerite is contynuance & perseuerance of oon maner of lyuyng aswele in the thyngys within as in theym withoute / But I approue nat that in an olde man be e∣grenesse nor hardnesse & sharpnesse of maners of condici∣ons / & also I may not consceyue nor vndirstonde why a∣uaryce & couetyse ought to be in an olde man / for ther is no thyng more vnreasonable nor more folyssh / then is for to hepe gretter quantite of wordily goodes or of vitailles in the tyme when the man hath lesse wey for to endure & & lyue / Nowe it is so that olde age aftir nature is the ende of the laste dayes of olde men / wherfor aftir rea∣son they ought lesse put them to thought solicitude and care for to gadre more grete hepes and plente of richesses and tresours thēne nedith / Here endith the fourth part & the thrid distinctōn of this boke & aftir begynneth the fyfthe part & the fourth & the laste distinction by the whiche Caton confoundith and repreuith the fourthe vituperacyon opposid ayenst olde age / begynnyng / Quarta restat /&c. bY cause that in the iijj distinctōn next of this boke I haue sufficiently answered to the thrid opposicōn / that yong age opposith ayenst olde age so behoueth nowe to
saye the fourthe cause answeryng to the fourth vitupera∣cyon of olde age reprouyng / whiche semith pryncypally to constrayne & forthenk our olde age / and this fourth vy∣tuperacōn is by cause that yong age lothith / esche with / & saith ayenst olde age by cause that it nygheth the deth / which aftir cours of nature may not be ferr from olde a∣ge / But oon defaute Scipion & Lelius consider ye I praye you how the olde man is a keitif wretchid & vnhappy which that seeth not ne vnderstōdith that in olde age men ought not to rek nor sett by neithir to be afferd of deth whethir it neyheth or cometh / ffor men ought not playnly to retche not of deth / but ought to defie it / if it quenche & bryng to nought the soule / as falsly saith & is the opini∣on of the philosopher Epicurus / Orels men ought na∣mely to desire the deth if it lede & bryng our soulys in som place for to be perdurable aftir the departyng of the body / as truly seith Aristotle prynce of philosophers and also they that folowyn hym / And it is true that betwixt thi∣se two meanes is founden no thrid / ffor it must nedys be that the sowle be dede or stynt & ende with the body / orels that aftir the deth of the body it lyuith euir / Thenne I / that am an olde man haue no cause for to doubte the deth if I shall not be wretchid nor vnhappy / aftir the deth by cause that my soule dyeth with my body as some affermyn falsly / Orellys I haue no cause for to doubte the deth / if aftir that I shalbe blessid & ioyouse euirlastyng / by cause yt my soule nedith not nor is ded for euir aftir this present deth And though ye oppose ayenst olde age that it be nygh the deth / Tell me what man is so grete afole / how be it
that he adolescent or yong of age that knowith of trouth & in certeyne / that he shall lyue tyl̄ eue / and for to excuse moreouir the iiij repreef & defaute alledged / I tell you Sci¦pion & lelius that yong age enclyned to excesse & to ou∣trageousnesse hath mo causes of deth / than our olde age / ffor yong men more lightly fallen in sekenessis / they be more greuously seke / they take helth more latter & with gretter daungier / And for this reason few men may come to olde age / And if the age of yongth wolde leue the ex∣cesse / & the grete outragyousnes of surfetes / & wolde folo∣we the temperaunce of olde age / the yong men shuld lyue better & more wisely / ffor in olde men is groūded with sad purpos aduis reason & coūseil / And it is certeyn that if ther had neuir be noon olde men / ther had neuir be no cy∣tees townes ne villages edified nor no comynaltees of men lyuyng / rulid & gouerned to the comon wele aftir Iustice / And by cause that I haue seid shortly that yong age fallith more lightly in sekenes & in parel of deth / than doth olde age / which hath be cause of a disposicōn for to e∣difye cytees & townes / & Iustely to make & ordeyne assem¦blees of men / and people to gouerne citees & townys & coūtrees / I begynne nowe & torne ayen how yong age op∣posith that the deth is the neyghbore of olde age / And for to tell the trouth there is no shame nor repreef to olde age by cause that they be nygh to deth / ffor ye see that yf the deth were Iuste cause of blame and of repreef / that cause shuld be commune to the age of adolescence and also to olde age / And as ye wele knowe I had a right good sone named Caton as I am / And
thou Scipion also haddist two bretheren yong men / which aftir their euident merites shulde / haue be in right grete dignite preferrid / That is to witt consuls of rome / as many oon trustid and hoped / which thre decessed in their yong age / where by I haue vndirstonde and perceyued ve¦rely / that deth is comon to all ages / But ye may saye that the man adolescent & yong hopith that he shall lyue longe / & aftir that a man is olde he may not haue such an hope / Therfor I answere you that the yong man hopith foliously / if by cause of his yong age he wenith to liue long / ffor he is not certayn therof nor knowith not the trouthe / Now ther is nothyng more foly thēne is for to haue & holde the doubtuose thyngys as certayn / & the fals as true / & if ye oppose ayenst olde age that the olde man hath nothyng in hym whereby he may hope to lyue more / I answere you Scipion & Lelius that by this thyng is bettir the condicion & the astate of the olde man than of the yong man / ffor the yong man will lyue long / & the olde man hath lyued long / how be it that in the life of the man is nothyng long by the ordenaūce of the goddys which to mankynde haue sett necessite & nede for to dye / I will Scipion in consideryng hou olde men lyuen that thou telltst me hou it is true that euery man haue some last tyme assigned / Consider we Architonius kyng of Tarse whiche is the pryncipalle countree of cilice / This Architonius as I haue seen writen in historyes reg∣ned foure & twynty yere And lyued six score yeris / But knowe ye Scipion and Lelyus that forsoth ther is no thyng that semith to me long / sith it hath some laste ende
ffor whenne that laste ende comyth / the tyme and yeris of grete peynes and labours / in yongth in grete auentu∣res whiche before be passed is thenne eskaped and ronne alle to geder / And than abideth onely in the remem∣braunce and mynde the merite / whiche thou hast conque∣rid by thy vertu and by thy good werkys doon in tyme pas¦sid / whiche ought make the glad whiche haste ouir ska∣ped all the Ieopardyes and auenturis as wele in bataile as in dyuers and many othir weyes perylouse aswele on the see as on the lande / The houres of the tyme of our life / and the dayes / and the monethys and also the yeris passen and come neuir ayen / And also the thyng to come may not be knowen / by no man nor in what place & in what astate he be aftir the deth / Euery man ought to be content and pleasid of suche hope of tyme / as god had yeuen hym for to lyue / And for to shewe how and why the man ought to lyue / I wolde that ye knowe that as the poete makith not onely by versys of a fable in his comedye callid an enterlude to thentente by cause that it please to hym that pleyeth it in the game / But the poete makith onely his comedye and / enterlude to thende by cause that in euery pagent he be preysed and commended of euery man aftir his playe / And the wise man also ought not to desire to lyue / tylle that he saye / That is to witt / I will no lenger of my life / ffor a short and a litle tyme of age is long for to lyue wele and honestly / And if it fortune that thou lyue but a short and litle tyme / thou owhtyst not to haue any more forthynkyng nor sorowe than haue the labourers of the landes / which haue
no forthenkyng nor sorowe / by cause that the swetnesse and softnes of prymetemps callid veer and spryngyng tyme be passed / And that the tyme of somer and of au∣tompne callid heruest be comyn / ffor though the labou∣rer see and smelle gladly the odoures of fresshe floures and herbes in prymetemps neuertheles / he is glad for the tyme of somyr in which ripyn the herbys trees and fruy∣tes of therthe / And for the tyme of autompne and her∣uest in whiche he gaderith them to gedir he putted them in the berne and in the garnere / Now ought ye to knowe that the perymetemps signifieth the age of adolescencye or of yongth whiche shewith by signes of prymetemps bourionyng and spryngyng what fruyte shall turne and do to the man in his tyme to come / And the two othir seasons / that is to witt somer and heruest be prouffitable and able for to repen mowe shere and gadre the fruytes to geder to the vse of men / And also it is true as I haue beforesayde that the fruyte of olde age signifieth the mynde and remembraunce and the habondaunce of the goodys / which before haue be made redy and conquerid by vertu of good werkys / and for to preue more ouir that for to dye in olde age / is noon harm nor repreef / I tell you Scipion and Lelius that alle thynges that be made aftir nature ought not to be accompted nor rekened amonges the goodys of the man / Nowe it is so that there is no thyng that is so moche accordyng aftir nature as is / that aswele men as othir thynges growyng by kynde dyen in the tyme of their olde age / and yit it is cer∣tayne that deth comith to yong men and adolescentys /
whiche is ayenst kynde & oute of nature / where by the deth is to them more peynefull soroufull & harde / And by that the adolescentes & yong men as me semyth dyen like as old men / which quencheth a strong & a right grete fflame of fyre / by castyng in of moche watir / and olde men dyen as a fyre which stynteth and wasteth it self / or as a can∣del / & the matche in a lampe of oyle consumith withoute doyng violēce & withoute any force & strength / I make eft sonys anothir cōmparison of deth / whiche comyth both to yong & olde men ffor as the appils & othir fruytes han∣gyng on the trees be by force plucked in the meane tyme whiles they be rawe & newe & when they be ripe & melowe by the heete of the sonne they fallen of with their free & playne will / & so the deth takith awey by hir violente force the life of yong men / and the ripnesse of olde age takith awey the life of olde men softely and withoute force / And this deth whiche comith by ripnesse of long age is so ioyfull and so agreable to me in so moche as I shall applye and come more nygh to it in a conuenient season / The deth is also to me noon othir wise ioyfull or agreable / than shuld be to me the deye londe / if me thought that I shulde see it when I seyle in a ship or swymme in the see to the porte or hauyn / And that it were likly that I shuld come to the porte or hauyn aftir that I haue sey∣led and vyaged long vpon the see / That is to witt that deth / which comith to the wise man aftir long age / is like the porte or h̄auen that men see from ferr in seylyng vpon the see whiche doth grete ioye when men be vpon the riuer in to the hauen warde and to haue takyn their porte salue /
ffor the drede of the parelles and daūgers of rokkes san∣dys and grete tempestys be than passid chaungid and turned in saftee and rest / How be it that the fyue first ages haue their ende and their terme / aftir certayne nom∣bre of yeris / Neuertheles olde age which is the laste hath no certayne terme / And yit thou maist rightly lyue in olde age in the meane tyme / & as long as thou maist per∣fourme and defende the werkys of life / and the offices in which thou art yeuen vnto / So alwey that thou doub∣te not deth though thou lyue long / whereby it fortuneth that namely olde age is more couragyouse and more hard and vigorouse ageyn alle feerys and dredys / than is adolescencye which doubtith and dredith deth / This thyng is preuid by the sentence that the right wise phi∣losopher Solon answerd to a tirant callid Phisistratus which Phisistratus by violence occupyed the lordship of Athenys / ffor where as the seid tiraunt demaūdid of Solon in what thyng / he pryncipally trusted / and why that he resisted hym so boldily / Men seyen that it is true / that the seid Solon answerd that he trusted in his olde age / by the boldenes of whiche he despised deth / & doubtid noon othir thyng / But I will not blame ligh∣tly them whiche desiren to lyuen / ffor the ende of lyuyng is right good whilom that man hath hole thenkyng of vndirstondyng & hole reason and naturell witte / certeyne and stable for to laboure in office perteynyng to life of man / Dame Nature whiche hath assembled and en∣creced in mankynde a body to wyrke / That is to witt / the thynkyng and the reasons and the wittys for to doo and
excercise the offices of the life / she brekyth hirself and bryngeth to nought hygh courage at the laste ende of a∣ge / when nature is consumed / So as it is in the werkys of nature / in like wise it is in the werkys of craftys / ffor the werkeman whiche hath made a ship or any othir edi∣fyce in byldyng / the same werkeman kan breke it right lightly / when it is olde and consumed / Nowe it is true that the tymbre and the matier and the bourdys newe fastened or glued be lightly disseuerd / and tho whiche ha∣ue be glued and fastened long tyme paste / be brokyn with grete peynes / So thēne Scipion and Lelyus may knowe that olde men ought not couetously desire that shorte space of life / which yet abydeth with them / and also they ought not to leue it withoute Iuste and honest cau∣se / whereby the cause to hurte hymself or shorte his life whiche by alle naturell kynde and by alle dyuyne reason is forbeden to euery man / sith that he may not doo that / which hath noon honest occasion / And the philosopher Pytagoras whiche forbedith that withoute the cōmaū∣dement of god / no man departe from the bodily life / he vseth and makith his reason by such likenesse and simi∣lytude as of a prynce of the lande whiche maketh the constable of a batayle whiche the prynce signifieth / whēne he ordeyneth his souldours to abyde & stonde in some place assigned / ffor he commaundith them that for nothyng they stere not ne remeuen withoute his commaundement Pitagoras by this exsample wolde say / that withoute the commaundement of god no man shuld purchace his deth / And if thou oppose and seyest ayenst that whiche
I haue said / That is to witt that the olde man ought not to desire to lyue the remenaunt of his tyme / ffor as thou saist / the philosopher Solon than olde / by expresse wordys ordeyned that his frendys shuld make sorowe we∣pyngys and lamentacyons aftir his deth / I tell the Scipion that the wise Solon wolde be lamented and bemeaned of his frendys by cause that they shuld shewe that he had loued them / and that they were euir in his lo∣ue / But I wote neuir Caton yf the poete Ennyus wolde be holden more dere and soroufull of his frendys by cause that aftir his deth he wold not be bywailled nor la∣mented / ffor by his verses he seid / that aftir his deth noon of his frendys shuld not desire hym ayen in wepyng / & that in his seruice of exequyes funerall noon shuld wepe for hym / I answere the Scipion that Ennyus vn∣dirstode hoely that men shuld not wepe for the deth of hym / nor of any othir that becomith vndedely and immor∣talle / aftir this present deth which comith to them whyche haue lyued all their life aftir alle vertues / Thou tel∣list me ayen Scipion / that olde men felyn in them some drede of the deth / which drede lastith by a litle while speci∣ally in the olde man whiche dyeth soone and softly with litle payne / Therfor I telle the Scipion that the fee∣lyng and vndirstondnyg of that dredefulnesse is suche that it ought to be desired ffor aftir deth it is nought / And by cause that the soule departed with the body the whiche I mene not othirwise / but what thyng euir it be of the feelyng of the deede of deth / we ought to haue sta∣ble thenkyng from our adolescence / for to lyue in suche

to witt / euery man like wise and vertuous dieth in right pacient courage and gladnes and euery man that is of folyssh and vicious disposicion / dieth in courage right vnpacyent and dredefull / Thenk ye so / but the courage of the holy man and good / whiche considerith and percey∣ueth more / and more ferre / seeth right wele / and knowith that the soule goeth in to a better place / and where it shal be better than it was in this present life / and therfor the wise good man dieth in right good pacient courage / and glad to departe / But the folisshe & delicious man / whiche for his ignoraunce and by the weyght of his vicys hath the light and clernesse feble and inclyned / so that he may not see nor knowe that his soule goeth in no bettyr place / nor for to be better than it was in this present life / And forsoth by cause that I am an olde man and nygh my deth / and also I thenk that my soule is inmortelle / I am right ioyfulle / for to desire / whiche I haue for to see youre ffadirs there decessid / with whom I haue be conuersaunt haunted and also I specially loued them for their grete vertues whiles they here in this present worlde were ly∣uyng And I haue not desire to see onely the men pas∣sed oute of this life / whiche I knowe by sight and by con∣uersacyon / But namely I haue desire for to see aftir my deth them / of whom I haue herde speke / & them of whom I haue redde by histories & them of whom I haue wreten amō¦gys them whom I vndirstonde that they be made inmor∣telle by their precedent meritys / fforsoth ther is no man that lightly shuld holde me to the loue of this wordly life / sith that I am in the wey for to goo with them
whiche be made inmortalle / And also ther is no man that lightly shuld make me tourne ayen from the weye by the whiche men passyn oute of this present life / How be it that some fonned and folisshe olde men desiren it ayen / I wolde that men wolde dryue them and re∣tourne them ayen in to yong age as men retournen a balle from oon merk to anothir / ¶And if some god wolde yeue me puissaunce that I whiche am an olde man / myght retourne ayen in to childhode / and that I shulde braye and krye in my swathyng cloth and in my cradelle like a childe / I wolde it not / but I wolde euen refuse it / ¶Yf ye demaunde me what / and how grete prouffite and auaile is / to be in this life I answere you / that ther is more laboure than prouffite But for to saye the trowthe / this life conteyneth both that one and that othir / That is to witt / prouffite and laboure / And neuirtheles this presente life con∣teyneth anothir fulfillyng or mesure / And olde men haue their fulle certeynte of this life / ffor the men of the othir fyue ages / haue terme and mesure of certeyne nombre of yeeris / ffor childhode conteyneth seuen yeris And so of the othir four folowyng / ¶fforsoth it liketh me not to wepe or sorowe in any wyse / by cause that my life is not lenger / And certeyne it is / that many men as foolys haue wepid and mourned / ffor this same cause / ¶And also I repente me not of that / that I haue lyued tille the tyme of olde age / ffor I haue so parfytely lyued / that I trowe not that I haue be in the worlde for nowght / nor in vayne / I departe me from

Here foloweth the said Tullius de Amicicia translated in to our maternall Englissh̄ tongue by the noble famous Erle / The Erle of wurcestre sone & heyer to the lord typ∣toft / which in his tyme flowred in vertue / & cunnyng / to whom I knewe none lyke emonge the lordes of the tem∣poralite in science & moral vertue / I beseche almyghty god to haue mercy on his sowle / & praye al them that shal here or rede this lityl treatys moch vertuo{us} of frendship in li∣ke wise of your charyte to remēbre his soule emong your prayers / And by cause this werke was made by the prin∣ce of Eloquence Tulluis intitled de Amycicia aftir that he had acheuid his boke de senectute / as hertofore ye maye more playnly see at large / thēne me semeth it requisite & necessarye that I sette in folowing th said book / this book de Amicicia / whiche by goddes grace shal playnly folowe Cicero de Amicicia qUintus Mucius Augur Seuola / This was his name / whiche was wonte to telle many thynges merely / And by mynde of Celius / Lelyus his fader in lawe / And he was not aferde to call hym a wise man in all his sayen∣ges / To the whiche Seuola I was putt by my fader / And aftir that I had taken the clothyng due to the astate of man / while I myght or that it was leeful to come so to doo / I neuir departed fro that good olde mannys syde / of whom I lerned many thynges disputed ripely / And many thynges said compendiously / And be∣houely suche I bare away / doyng my payne by meanes
of his wisedom to fynde my self the better taught / And after his decesse / I was with anothir Seuola a bisshop. the which I dare wel saye the most excellent man in wise∣dom & Iustice. But no force of that at this tyme / I will retorne to the first Seuola. whan he lyked to tell vs of many thynges sittyng in his chayer. as he was wont to doo at home. as I am wel remembrid whyle I was there & fewe of my seruaūtes with hym / Hit fortuned hym to fall in such speche. as wel nyghe in euery mans mouth in this wise sayeng. Attice ye remembre wel as I trowe. & moch the rather that ye were conuersaunt with Publius Supplicius whan he was one of the Trybunys of the peple. how he fyll at varyaūce / and at dedly hate with hym Quintus Pompeyus that tyme Consul / And syth he had lyued with hym in grete nyghnes of loue. How gre∣te meruaile and complaynt was had of the peple. ye your self knowen wel / And whan Seuola had fallen thus in this langage / he declared thus the wordes which Lelyus had vsed vnto hym of frendship / & his sone in lawe Fa¦unyus the sone of Marcus within fewe dayes aftir the deth of Scipio Affrycan. The sentences of the whiche disputacōn / I bare surely in my remembraūce. And haue disposed the same in this boke. as me semeth / and therwith introduced the same persones in spekyng to gyders / lest if I made my boke othirwise / I sholde vse to ofte / quoth I / And quoth he / And therfor muche the rather I dyde it / that it shold seme / as yf the same persones had the same langage / And Attice syth ye haue ofte entreted me to wryte somwhat of frendship / It semeth me / that it setteth me right wel to doo so / As wel for it was a
thynge due & necessarye to the knowleche of all peple / as to the grete familyarite & frendship bytwene vs tweyne / Therfor I haue obeyed not vngladly thentent / that by thaccomplisshemēt of your desire. I shold mowe doo prouf∣fyte to many one. but in lyke wise as I dyde in my boke whiche I wrote vnto you of age entitled Cato Maior. where I enduced the olde Cato disputyng of age. ffor so moche / as he was semed to me the moost apte persone in that behalue I mene to speke of age / Also syth he was of so many yeris aboue all other. lyke wise syth I wndirstā∣de by our faders the memorable familyarite vsed bytwene Gayus Lelyus & Publius Scipio Amore apte persone. I coude not remembre to dyssyde better the mater of frendship / than the seid Lelius / namely syth my mais¦ter Seuola remembrid vnto me / how Lelyus hath re∣sonned with hym in the same matier / And I can not re∣membre me / how my werke shold mowe seme of gretter weight & auctorite. than if I cause the wordes whiche I shal vse to come from their brestes / which ben knowen of grettest auctorite and worshippe. Therfor when I rede my owen werkes I am disposed somtyme. that I deme Cato speketh & not I. But as that tyme I brought in an a∣ged man to speke with another of age. so in this boke I most frendly to the my frende wryte of frendship. That tyme spak Cato whos older thenne coude not be foūde / ne in his dayes his wiser. Now Lelius bothe wise & experte. so he is reputed / & excellēt in the souerayn fame of frend∣ship spekith of amytee or frendship. & of one I pray you to take hede a lytil while to the excucōn of this desire / and

varye in their opynyons from other folkes / whiche putte seuen to be callid wise men / we haue vnderstande one in Athenes / And that he was so shewed and Iuged by the answere of Appollo / But they thurgh suche wisedome to be in you that ye suppose / hou ye haue nothyng but such as is your plenare power / And therwith euery fortune happe or chaunge be subget to vertu / whiche causeth Se∣uola here present / And me to praye you / that we may vn¦derstande / how ye take the deth of Scipio Affrycan / and moche the rather / sith at our assemblee / this othir day in the gardyn of Decius Brutus / so were we woonte to entrecomyne of dyuerse matiers concernyng our weel publik / ye were not present / where ye ne faylled in tymes past with alle diligence there taccomplissh your dutee / Seuola / Some men demaunde me and many of my felaws / ffaunyus in like wise as it is saide afore / the cause I meane of your absence from that place / And I haue answerd as I haue thought / layeng the cause vnto the sorowe / whiche ye haue late taken / sayeng that how be it your wisedom toke moderatly the deth of so worshipful a man and so especail frende / yet your humanyte myght not suffre you to be free of diseace and sorow And that ye were not presente in our companye / at that day / I said it was rather longe on your diseace / than sorow / Lelyus / fforsothe Seuola / euen as it was ye saide / I wote right wel for ony thyng / that sholde haue touched my self yf I had ben of power / I shold not haue ben thens ne haue fawted in my du∣tee / And namely in that / that I haue not be vsed to
faute in / ne I can suppose that a lytil thynge shold mowe happen to ony man wel disposed auised or stedfast / that he shold seace at ony tyme of the doyng of his duete / And as to you ffaunyus / which laye so grete thynge of wor∣ship to me / and so moche that my self knowe not therof ne desire the same / ye doo that as my frende / but as me se∣meth / ye deme not a right of Cato / ffor eyther ther was neuer wise man / And that I beleue wel / or ellys yf ther were ony / he was one / as in settyng alle othir thynges a∣syde in that / that he suffred so euenly the deth of his sone I can remembre Paulus and I haue seen Gayus / but beware that ye not compare eyther of thise / with Cato the man of grettest auctorite and most sette by / ne yet preferre hym our Cato whom Appollo Iuged to be wy∣sest / ffor Socrates was praysed for his sayeng / And Cato for his deades / And as for me syth I muste speke with you bothe / vndirstande me in this wise / yf I shal naye my self to be moeued with the deth of Scipio / whe∣ther I shal mowe doo so truly / I reporte me to alle wise men / ffor I knowe my self wel / that I shal so sayeng ma∣ke a lefynge / no doubte of I am moued ffor the lack of suche a frende / ffor his semblable as I trowe in frendship was neuir / And I dar wel saye / ther was neuir none such But me nedeth no medecynes / I wil comforte my self / And pryncypally with this comfort / that I lak that errour / that causeth othir to be of the vexyd whan their frendes decesse / I trowe ther myght no thynge come to Scipio of euill / And yf ther dyde I had my parte therin Who so euir he be that in the diseace of his frende soroweth
he sheweth hym self the very louer of his frende / Who is he / that may saye naye / but that he is right wel departed from this world / on lesse that he be suche one / that setteth lytil or nothyng by inmortalite / And what is that he had not / that was lee full to ony man to wisshe / dyd not he sur∣mounte the grete hope of all the Cyteseyns / whiche they had of hym the tyme of his childhode / whan that he cam to thestate of man / by his incredible vertue / he neuer shewed to be made Consul / and twyes enioyed he that astate / the first tyme afore or he was ripe of yeres / The seconde tyme / whan he was of age conuenient / And yet almost to late for our weel publik / ffor he euerted two grete Cytees to Rome / the most capitayl enemyes / and with one batayle depressyd not onely the felde made ayenst hym / but many other feldes and batailles Immynent / and lykely yf the victory had not thenne fallen on his syde / What shal I saye of his goodly maners / of his pyte / whiche he v∣sed to his moder / liberalite to his susters / boūte to his fren∣des / and Iustice to all folkes sith they be not vnknowen to you / And hou welbeloued he was in our cytee / the com∣plaint made aboute his heers bereth sufficient witnes what helpeth thēne the addyng to / of fewe yeres vnto Scipio ffor sothe age though it be not greuous / as I am remem∣bred Cato saide the yere afore he deyed in comynycacyon had bytwene hym Scipio & me / yet it hath taken away the grenesse & lustynesse which Scipio had at that tyme / neuirtheles he was suche in lyf / fortune / & glorye / that ther myght nothyng ther vnto be added / The hastynesse of his deyeng toke away the felyng of his deth from hym / hou be
dyed it is hard to saye / what men deme / ye see wel / Neuir∣thelesse this I may wel saye / emong alle tho dayes which were of grettest worship and gladnes to Scipio / That day next afore the day of his deth / whan he departed oute of the senate / he was conduyted and accompanyed home with the faders conscript / The people of rome with their straungers vnder their obeyssaunce and amytee / and with the latyns was to hym the daye of grettest worship And thēne fro that hygh degree of astate / it semed hym sodeynly to be called vp moche rather to the goddes aboue than to the goddes bynethe / Ne I can not holde with them which haue bygonne lately the opynyon / to holde that the soules dye with their bodyes / and that deth maketh so an ende of alle attones / ffor the auctorite of folkes of olde tyme is therto contrarye / with whiche I holde gretely / and to our elders / whiche haue acquyted them so rely∣giously / whiche haue deyed in their tymes / And that they ne wolde haue doon / yf they had trowed so / hit had not ap∣perteyned in ony wise to them / or the auctorite of them whiche haue ben in our cytee / and som tyme haue with their holsom preceptes and lawes yeuen sufficient doctry∣ne to grete Grece that tyme flowryng / and now wasted and destroyed / or his auctorite that was called the wisest by Appollo / whiche said not now this / Now that / as he dyde in many othir thynges / but alwey abode ferme in this sayeng / that the soules of men ben dyuyne / And whan they departe from the bodyes / if they haue ben good and iuste in their lyuyng / their waye vnto heuen is open and right spedy to alle suche / And so it was semed vnto
the same Scipio / ffor right a fewe dayes afore that he deyed / whan Philus and Manylius were present and your self Seuola and dyuers other thre dayes to gydre he disputed of our estate publik / and the conclucion was of the inmortalite of the soule / the whiche he saide and ler∣ned of Scipio Affrican by vysion of his slepe / Thēne yf it so be that the soule of euery excellently good man / shal departe lightly in the lightest wyse in his deyeng / as for the kepyng & bondes of the body / to whom shold / we de∣me that / Aliter / Ascence was graūted vnto hym namely of the goddes than vnto Scipio / Wherfor I dar not compleyne his fortune / leste than I be thought rathir to hym enuious than frendly / yf othirwise perauenture I were aferde / lest the deth of the body & the soule were all one / & so as ther is nothyng of good in deth / so in like wise there is nothing of euil in the same / ffor whan the fe∣lyng is goon from a man / he were as good / he had neuir be born / yet we are glad that euir Scipio was born / and so shal this cyte ben as long as it shal endure / Therfor as I said aboue / he is wele deled with all / & I more brus∣ly delt with all than right wolde / ffor sith I entred in to this lif afore hym / I sholde by reason haue deyed afore hym / Neuirtheles I vse so ioyously the remembraunce of our frendship / that me semed I lyued prosperously / ffor that I haue had and leyed my lyf with Scipio / with whom my charge of thynges concernyng our estate pub∣lyk and pryuate were euen departed / and with whom in werre & peas was alwey one / And in that wherin rested the grettest force of frendship / oure willes / studyes / and
felynges were all one / Therfor the vntrewe fame of this wisedom / whiche ffaunyus hath remembred me / to haue delited me / not so gretly as doth this / I truste that the re∣membraunce of the frendship bytwene me and Scipio shal euer endure / And so moche the more ioyous to me it is / that in alle worldes passed / vnneth thre or foure couple of suche frendes be named / emong whiche / I truste that the frendlyhod of Scipio with Lelyus shalbe knowen / to all them whiche shal come aftir vs / ffauny∣us / Lelyus it must be as ye saye / but sith ye haue made mencion of frendlihode / and that we ben at good leyser / ye shal doo to me a thynge / and so I trowe to Seuola wonder agreable / namely yf ye shal please as ye were wonte to done in alle other thynges of you demaunded / to dispute in this matier of frendship what ye fele / what ye repute and what preceptys ye wil yeue to the same / Seuola / Hit shal be to me right agreable / that ye so dispute / Neuirtheles ffaunyus toke out of my mouth the thyng that I wold haue said / wherfor not only to ffauni∣us / but to me. ye shal doo a thyng of grete pleasyr. Le∣lyus. Hyt shal not greue me so to doo / yf I were assu∣red of my self / ffor no doubte of the matier is right no∣table. And as ffaunyus sayth we be at good leyser. But what maner man am I. or what is my habylite. The custōme of lerned men is this. and the grekes haue the same. to haue a matier purposed vnto them. And they recke neuir though it come sodeynly. vpon the which they wille dispute. but that is a grete werke. and suche as nedeth not a lityl excersice. wherfor touchyng suche
thinges as may be disputed of amytee / I wil aduise you to desire it of them / whiche take vpon them suche thynges But thus forsothly I may exhorte you that ye preferre amyte / to fore alle other humayne thynges / fforsothe ther is no thynge so conuenyent / and veryly apte to men eyther in prosperite or aduersite / But this I deme fyrst / ffrendship may not be in othir / than in good folkes / And yet I wil not goo so nere the quycke / as to saye that it may not be / but in good folkes / as peraduenture some will so holde / the whiche enserchyng the matier cu∣riously / and perauenture trewly / but for oure wele publik easely they denye ony man to be good yf he be not wise / wel be it so / but thenne they make suche an interpretacion of wisedom / that as yet no mortal man coude atteyne the lyke therof / But lete vs take hede therof rather of the thynges that ben in the commyne vse and lyf of man than of suche thynges / as ben ymagyned or desyred to be ffor I shal neuir calle Gayus ffabrycius Marcus cu∣rius or Titus cornucanus / whiche our forffadres hel∣de wise / yf I sholde folowe that rule / wherfore lete they theym whiche yeue suche interpretacyon of wisedom take the name of wisedom to them self / The whiche name is right enuious and derke / or lete them graunte / that the said persones were good / And that forsothe they ne shal but denye / that name of goodnesse to be graunted to ony / but to wise men / And lete vs be more playn and blonte Thenne suche as saye / that they deme them self and their lyf so / that their fayth / holynesse of maners / ffelysship and lyberalyte may be shewed / And that ther is in them
no couetise of worship / luste / or vndue hardynes / but gre / te stedfastnesse like wise as was in theym whom I haue named aboue. lete vs Iuge thise good men. as they we∣re holden so to be called. the whiche gete as forsothly as men may the best nature to their guyde in alle their ly∣uyng. Me semeth that I sholde so vse to be so born. That ther shold be a maner of felisship emong alle persones And moche the rather. that euery man hath an inclyna∣cion vnto the same / So that one cyteseyn drawe rather to an other / than one straunger to another / And tho that ben of kynne / rather than tho that ben fer of. ffor nature her self hath brought forth frendship in this excel∣lent kynrede. but from frendship neuir for to take awey benyuolence / ffor th̄ne take awey the name of frendship And so it is not in nyghnesse of blood. And how grete the force of frendship is. by this it may best be vndir∣standen. ffor emong the infenyte companye of mankynde. whiche nature hath goten to her self. it is a thyng so na∣rowly brought to gydre / and drawyn so streyte. that alle maner of loue restith bytwene tweyne. or bytwene right fewe. ffrendship fforsothe is nothyng ellis but the knyttyng to gydre of that thyng that is goodly. and of that thyng that is humayne with souerayne benyuolence and charyte. And I wote neuer. on lesse than it were wi∣sedome. what bettir thyng myght be graunted vnto man by the goddes Inmortall / Neuirthelesse some saye / that richesse is bettir than it. And some heale / And some po∣wer. and some worship. and some pleasaunce. But the laste is a beestely opynyon. And the thyngys byfore /
ben ful slyper / and vncertayn / and not only putt in our disposicions / but in folehardynesse of fortune / They for∣soth whiche putt the highest wele in vertue. put her right wele and notably / and as they shold doo / but the self vertue bryngeth forth frendship & continueth / ffor ffrend∣ship may be in no wyse withoute vertue / But now lete vs make an interpretacyon of vertue accordyng to the comune spekyng and lyuyng / ne lete vs amesure it aftir the magnyficence of wordes / as though we were gretly lerned our self / but lete vs calle them good men / whiche ben holden good / as Paulos / Catones / Gayos / Sci∣piones and Philos / The comune lyf is content with them / and lete vs forgete them / that can by no maner be foūde in ony place emonge such men as I reherced byfore / ffrendship hath so many oportunytees / that I may vnne∣the reherce them / And first of alle / who is he / that may be leefully in this lyf / as Enneus saith / that restith not / in the good ioynt or good will of some frende / And what may be more plesaunt / than to haue suche a frende / that ye maye speke therby such fruyt in thynges prospero{us} / yf ye ne had some one to enioye of your prosperite as gretely as your self / & how hard were it / to suffre thynges aduerse withoute one / whiche wolde be soryer / for your aduersite than your self / fforsoth other thynges / whiche ben gretely desired ben right behofful euery thyng with other / As ri∣chesse for vse / plente for reuerence / worship for lawde or fame / plesaunce for gladnesse / And heale for lack of pey∣ne / and for the vse of the gyftes of the body / But frend∣ship conteyneth many thynges / whyther so euer ye turne
you it is redy / hit is putt out in noo place / ffor it is neuir slowe. it is neuir greuous / Therfor as they saye / we vse not fyre or water in moo places / than we vse frendship / Ne I speke not now of the vulgar & meane oppynyon of frendship. which peraduenture shold both delyte & prouf¦fyte / But of that frendship which is very & parfyght / like to theirs / which haue ben but fewe in nombre deserued / so to be callyd / no doubte of. ffrendship embelisshyth prospe∣ryte / releueth aduersyte / And is partener to bothe / But by side the manyfolde grete commodyte / is that frendship hath in hym self in this / it doth excell merueyllously abo∣ue that. that it doth in ony other / That is to saye / that it yeueth good hope to our lyf / whiche we are to lyue / and suffreth not our myndes neyther to be enfebled ne ouer∣throwen / Also forsothe who so euir seeth his frende / seeth a maner lykenesse of hym self / Therfor whan they ben ab∣sente / they ben nygh to gydre / And whan they ben nedy / they habounde in goodes / And whan they ben feble / they ben of grete force / And that whiche is hardest to byleue / whan they be dede they lyue / So grete is the desire. so gre∣te is the worship. so grete is the remembraunce of frend∣ship. Syth that their deth is thought so blessid. and their lyf is thought so worshipfull. And take awey from na∣ture the ioyned good will of thynges. and neyther hows ne cytee. ne tylthe of londe shal remayne. And yf this be to lytil to vndirstonde the force of frendship and acor∣de by. hit may be aperceyued by his contrarye. that is to saye by varyaunce and debate. ffor where may be founde an housholde so stable. or a cytee so ferme. that may not
be ouerthrowen by meane of hate & discorde / by the whiche it may be sone Iuged / how good a thyng frendship is / They saye that a man named Agrigentinus / wel ler∣ned in the dytees of grece / by maner of prophecye had this langage / what so euir it be in the nature of thynges / or in all the world / whiche hath a naturell mouyng / desireth his lyke / & fleeth his contrarye / And euery naturel man vnderstandeth and preyseth frendship / And disprayseth & rebuketh enemytee / In so moch that whan ony man / hath taken thoffice of a frende vpon hym / in adressyng of hym self to parell / or in takyng parte of Ieobardye with his frende / who is he / that prayseth not his deade in the hyghest wyse / what crye and noyse caused the tragedye playd in the hous of myn hoost and my frende Marcus potumus whan Thoas there prsent sought Orestes / and enserched so narowly / that he cam to the place / where he foūde tweyne of the whiche he knewe that he was one. Pylades his felawe there / whiche toke vpon hym thenne the name of Orestes of full will & purpoos to dye for hym / And the said Pylades Orestes felawe thēne constantly sayeng yet am I he / whiche ye haue sought and not Pylades / how glad the peple were whan they sawe this played and feyned ye knowe wel And how moche more glad trowe we / they wolde haue ben. yf they had seen it doon in very de∣de / there nature shewed veryly her force / whan tho men which myght not doo it theym self / they Iuged excellent∣ly wel doon in another / Hyther to me semeth I myght saye that / whiche I felte of frendship / yf ther be ony thynges to be said ferther. as I trowe ther ben many.
thenne aske ye of theym / whiche takyn vpon theym to dispute lyke maters Faunyus. We had lyuer hyere it of you / though I haue demaunded / and herde it of other not ayen my will· But we loke all aftir another maner thred of your spynnyng / Seuola ffaunyus. ye wold moche the rather saye so. yf ye had be present a lytil afore the deth of Scipio. whan my fader Lelyus and he dis∣puted of our estate publycque / whan he was so grete / and so stronge a protectour of right wisnesse / ayen the study∣ed reasons of Philus / Faunyus. Hit was easy for hym / which was moost Iuste hym self / to defende the parte of Iustice. Seuola What saye ye. and why not as lightly frendship. by the which he hath goten / in shewyng of hym self stedfaste and faithful / therin souerayn glo∣rye / Lelyus fforsothe ye are aboute tenforce me / but it is but lytil to be taken hede of / by what meane ye cōstrey∣ne me / but no doubte. and ye enforce me / harde it is / and not with equyte. to withsaye your pleasirs / whiche ben my sonnes in lawe / And namely in that thynge. whiche is good. fful ofte whan I haue remembrid my self of frend∣ship. I haue ben acustomed. to thenke whether / that frend∣ship shulde be desired / in tyme of feblenesse and nede / so that one shol̄de receyue / or yeue to another / of benefayttes to be yeuen or taken / that thyng that he myght not attey∣ne to by hym self / and whethyr this was very due or pro∣pre to frendship / but me semeth ther was another cause better / fayrer / & more natural / And that is loue of whome amytee hath his name / ffor of Amor comyth Amicicia And that loue is the pryncypal / and the chief thynge in
ioynyng of good will. ffor prouffyt is ofte had of them whom we worship and obserue by the colours of frend∣ship acordyng to the seasons / but in veray frendship / there is nothyng feyned or dyssymyled / And what someuir is in frendship / it hath his begynnyng rather of nature / than of nede or indigence· And that it cometh rather of appli∣eng of mannes will. to the felyng that he hath to loue. than of the thought he hath. what prouffyte shold growe therby. ffor what is it in it self. it may be soone espyed in beestys. whiche loueth them that they brynge forth for a certeyn tyme / And be as well byloued agayn. so that the felyng of frendship is sone apperceyued in suche beestys. But moche more euidently in man / ffyrst by that charyte and loue parfyght / whiche is bytwene the childeren / and fader and moder / whiche may not be dysseuerid withoute grete and detestable offence / Secondly yf ther be a lyke felyng in other personnes of loue / as thus. yf we may gete ony man acordyng to our maner and nature / of whom we may see the lyght of prowesse & vertue / ffor no doubte of / ther is nothyng more amyable than vertue / ffor it happeth ofte / that we loue theym. whom we dyde neuer see / ffor theyr vertue & probyte / Who is he / that vseth not the remembraūce of Cueus Fabrycius & Marcus Cu¦rius with a maner of charyte & beneuolēce / & yet we neuir sawe them / and ther ayen / who is he / that hateth not Tar∣qnynus Superbus. Publius Cassius / & Spurius Melius. We haue fowghte with two prynces in ytalye for the soueraynte / and they were Pirrus and Hanybal And as touchyng the fyrst / we owe hym no grete
euyl will / for the probyte and prowesse which we felte in hym / and the seconde this cyte shal neuir but hate hym for his cruelnesse / Thenne yf ther be so grete force in probite that we loue in them. whiche we neuir sawe / and moche more in oure enemy / What merueyle is it / though the courages of men ben / gretly moeued / whan it semeth them that they may see vertue and prowesse in theym / with whom they may be famulyer / Though loue be confermed by benefaytes taken / and loue vndirstanden / and ofte fa∣mylyaryte. The whiche thynges Ioyned with the fyrst mocion of corage and loue / causeth a man merueyllous encreas of feruent benyuolence / Therfore and who som euer trowe that it procedeth of feblenesse or impotencie. or that the said feblenesse sholde be the moyen to attayne. to that whiche they desyre in frendship / Sothly they leue the begynnyng of frendship. to humble / to bare / and to vnworshipfull / syth that they wille / that it shold sprynge of wretchidnesse and indigence / And yf that were trewe / who so euer were leest of reputacyon and hauoure. were most apte to frendship. And that is alle other wise / ffor als so moche more / as a man is most asured in the moste saufgarde of vertue and wisedom. so that he hath no nede of ony other outward helpe / but thynketh that in hym self is / alle that he hath nede of / so moche the more is he excellent in frendshippes to be atteyned. what nede had Scipio Affrycan to me / fforsothe none. Ne I of hym / but I by a maner of admyracy∣on of his vertues loued hym / And he hauyng som good oppynyon peraduenture loued me / And oure
customme and famylyaryte· encreaced oure benyuolence / And though right grete & moche prouffyte enfiewed to eyther of vs / by the same. yet it was not the cause. that made vs fyrst to loue / ffor we be lyberall and glad to doo good. Not for that we loke aftir a reward of duete. ffor thenne oure benefayte were grounded vpon vsure / But we be naturelly redy to thadminystracyon of fredom So and in lyke wise / we be enduced to byleue / that frendship shold not be vsed for the hope of rewarde / But for the fruyt. that groweth of the same / and that is loue. Neuirtheles I am in all wyses of dyuerse oppynyon from the folkes. whiche aftir their beestely sensualyte / putt the begynnyng of frendship in flesshely luste / And what meruaille is. though they which so doo / may see nothynge whiche is hyghe / worthy to be magnefyed or dyuyne / syth that they sette their myndes & thoughtes. vpon a thyng so symple and vyle. Therfor lete vs sette a syde alle such from oure communycacyon / And lete vs vndirstande / that the felyng of loue / and thentiernesse of good wille cometh of nature / with the sygnefyeng of prouesse from eyther partye / the whiche sygnyfycacyon of loue / who som euer they be that desire it. they applye them self as nyghe as they can / to suche as they haue bygonne to loue. that they may enioye theyr custommes and maners. so that they may be euen & egall in maner of louyng / & more redy to meryte wel of theyr frende / than to aske agayn / the thynge that they haue meryted wel in / Suche worship∣ful stryf shold be alwey bytwene theym / that is to saye Who so mowe doo moste for other / so grete prouffytes
shal growe of their frendship / And this begynnyng of frendship / which procedeth of nature shal be more weyghty and verray / than that whiche procedeth of nede / ffor yf so be that prouffit shold be the cause of knyttyng of frend∣ship / Whan so euir that prouffyt faylleth. frendship is loosed / but for as moche / as nature may not be chaunged the frendlyhodes whiche growe of nature / be most ferme / and lengest enduryng / ye see now als ferre as I can shewe / the begynnyng / and the first Origenal of amytee / Please it you ony other thynge / Faunyus Go forth Lelyus as ye haue bygonne we praye you / ffor I may take vpon me to answere lawfully for hym / that is yonger than I / Seuola Brother ye doo not amys / therfore lete vs here our fader in lawe / Lelyus Right worshipful sones / here now the thynges. whiche were ofte dyssyded. bytwene me and Scipio of frendship. Neuirthelesse he seide ful ofte / that ther was nothynge more hard to be byleued / than that frendship myght en∣dure bytwene tweyne / vnto theyr laste lyf dayes / ffor he sayde / it happeth right ofte. that some one thynge is expedyent to one. that is not expedyent to that other / Also in thestate publyque / they varye in thayr opyny∣ons / There with he saide the maners of men ben ofte chaū∣ged / Some chaunged them in theyr aduersyte / Some in theyr prosperyte. Some in theyr greuous yeres. And that is in theyr olde age / And he toke his exsample of his fyrst flouryng ages / Sayeng that some childeren loue in the hyest wyfe / tyl they come to the age of seuen∣ten / and thenne chaunge / And yf they happen to continue
to the yeres of force and iustynesse / eyther for the loue of wymmen / or for couetyse of good / they shal falle at stryf and debate. And that is for that they both / may not haue one thynge / and yf they passe that tyme / of continuaunce of frendship / tyl they ben of ryper yeres. it happeth ofte the same frendship to febbe and faylle / yf they falle in stryf for worship. A gretter sore can not be in frend∣ship / than the couetyse of good / whiche vexe men gretly / But the moost hurte of frendship is / whan they whiche ben moche worshipful. stryue for worship and glorye / of the whiche stryf. most dedly enemyte hath happed ofte by∣twene theym / whiche haue ben moost frendly / Also we haue seen of grete debates for the more parte / whan some thynge haue ben desyred. and asked vnresonably of frendes. as that one wille praye the other to be a my∣nystre of his luste / or an helper of his wronge / the which thyng / whan he refuseth to doo / though he doo so acordyng to worshippe / yet is he blamed of vnkyndenesse. And the breache of frendship by suche as wolde not serue to their ententes / And thenne they saye. that ther is nothyng. that their frende wolde desire of theym. but that they wold doo it gladly for their sakes / So by this olde maner of quarellyng / ffamylyaryte hath not only be sette a syde / But also perpetuel hate. hath growen of the same / So Scipio saide it semed hym / how frendlyhode is subgete to so many fawtes and parellys / that it is not only thoffice of a wysman / but of a gracious man to fle it / ffor so moche thenne / bete vs see fyrst. yf it shal so plese you. how loue shold procede in frendship. how suppose ye
though̄ Coriobanus had frends / shold they haue werred with hym ayenst their owen cōtree & cyte / And what Be∣silinus which desired to be a kyng emong vs / or Melius we haue seen Tiberius Gracchus weyeng oure estate publyque / fforsaken of Quyntinus Tubero & such other his frendes. And Cueus Blaxius a Cuman born And your hoost Seuola. whan he cam to me that same tyme present Lemates & Rupilius that same tyme be∣yng consuls / prayeng me that I wolde spare hym ma∣kyng his cause / for that he sette so moche by Gracchus. that what so euer he had commanded hym to doo. hym thought / it was leeful to hym to doo the same / Thenne I asked hym yf he had commanded the to haue brought fyre to haue brente the capytoyle with / woldest thou haue doon so. he said. But & he had cōmanded me so / I wolde haue obe∣yed his cōmandement / how thynke ye was not this a cur¦syd answere / And forsothe he dyde / as he saide / ffor he not only obeyed to the folyssh presumpcyon of Tyberyus Gracchus / but therwith helped it forth as ferre / as was to hym possible / so he made not hym self the seruaunt of his wodenesse / but ouer that / the guyde & the conduytour of the same / therfor his madnesse was fresshe enquyred of / & he therfor sore aferde fledde in to Asie to our enemyes. and suffred for the same greuo{us} & Iuste paynes / Therfor I saye it is none excuse of synne. whan a man sayth he dyde it / by cause of his frende / ffor syth that vertue is the verray knotte of frendship it is harde for frendship to a∣byde. whan men departe fro vertue. ffor yf that we thynke resonabl̄ to graūte vnto our faders all yt they wold haue of
vs. or to desire of theyin. all that we wold haue of theym late vs be of so parfyght wisedom / that in our desires ne theyres. be ony thyng of vice / But for so moch as we speke of suche frendes as we see / or of such as we remem∣bre· that ben here in this comyn lyf emonge vs. it is beste we take oure exsamples of them. and in especial of them / which drawen next vnto wisedome We haue seen Publius Emilius right coūersaunt and familyer with Lucinius / And as we haue vndirstande by oure faders they were twyes called bothe attones to estate and dig∣nyte / ffirst they were made bothe Consoris and countrol∣lers of maners / Also it is wreton how Marcus curius and Titus cornucacius were gretly ioyned to thise forsaid in frendship and good will / And bytwene thyse tweyne / that I laste spak of / was grete loue / And it is not to be demed / that ony of thise / desired of his frende that. whiche sholde be contrarye to his fayth / to his pro∣mysse or to his estate publyque / what nedith to speke of suche thynges of thise folkes / whiche were so good and holy / ffor yf ony man had desired ony suche thynge of them / he wold not haue obteyned it / ffor it is lyke offence to desire suche a thynge / to asseeth the same desire / what though Cueyus Carbo and Cueyus Cato. were of the the bende of Gracchus and Cueyus Frater / yet now he is his grettest enemye. Therfor lete this now in frendship be confermed / That we desire / nothynges of his inhoneste· And though other folkes desire suche thynges of vs / that we agree not ther vnto. It is a foule excuse. and in no wise to be resceyued / ne
in that / that touched our estate publyque / ne yet in smal∣ler offenses / whan one saith / that for my frendes sake I dyde amys / But we be brought to that plyght Fauny∣us and Seuola / that we haue grete nede to forse right wel / what shal nede to our estate publique / ffor the good custommes of our oolders ben gretly sette a syde / out of the place and waye / that they were in / Titus Gracchus peyned hym self to be a kynge and regne vpon vs / and yf I shal saye more truly / he regned. though it were but fewe monethes / The people of Rome had not herd ne seyn a lyke thynge. And Gracchus frendes and kynnesmen aftir his deth / folowed his stappes / I may not telle you withoute terys / what they dyde ayenst Publius Scipio we endured Carbo / of the whiche we spak right now / for the newe & fresshe payne / that Titus Gracchus suffred what we sholde loke after / ffor the office of trybune. that Cueyus Gracchus occupieth. me lyst not to deuyne / But I see wel. the thyng crepeth / the which whan it hath ones be bygōne it fallith to redy destrucōon / See ye not in your myndes. the spotte whiche is in the table before that it is made first caused of the lawe. whiche Gabynus made. And within two yere by the lawe that Gassius made / me semeth that I see the people disseuerid from the Cene. And the grettest thynge langyng to our estate publyque. excuted aftir the wyll of multitude / that will haue them. And ther be moo that shal lerne / how suche thynges shold be practised / Thenne how they sholde be let∣ted / but to what entente saye I thus. but for this cause. that I wote wel ther is no man / that wille attempte so
grete werkes. but he be sure of many felaws to assiste hym. Therfor thoos whiche ben good / sholde be aduerti∣sed / that yf they fallen vnwytyngly of ignoraūce in such maner of felawships / that they shold trowe them self so bounden to suche frendys / that yf they trespace ayenst oure estate publyque / that they ne sholde departe from theym / ffor payne is alwey due to theym that offenden / And it is nolesse due to them that ben their felaws and parteners in the same Cryme / than vnto them that were theyr leders / and setters on / Who was clerer and more myghty in grece than Themystocles / whan he was Em¦perour / he delyuerd alle grece of seruytude / by the bataille which he hadde ayenst them of perse / Aftirward for enuye / whan he was putt in exile / He suffred not the wronge of his vnkynde coūntree. the which / he sholde in all wise haue suffred / but dyde in lyke wise there / as Coriolanus dyde here with vs not twenty yere a goo / that coude not fynde one of his Cytezeyns / that wolde helpe hym in the warre ayenst his owen cōtree / and therfor eyther of hem slough̄ wilfully hym self / wherfore such conspiracye of them that be noughty / is not to be couerd and closed by thexcuse of frendship / but moche rather to be auenged of that No man sh̄old trowe that it is suffred or graunted / that no frende shold helpe another / by colour of frendship / which wolde werre vnto his owen contree / ffor there be but fewe men that knowen / whan a thyng is bygonne / what thende and thissue of the same shal be / But as for me I take no lesse care to thynke / what oure estate publique shal be aftir my deth / than I doo thynke what it is at this daye /
Thenne late this first lawe of frendship be stablisshed. that we desire nothyng of our frendys. but that is wor∣shipfull. ne doo nothyng for their sakes / but suche as is acordyng to worship / And yf we knowe ony such thyng lete vs tarye / tyl we be prayed. but lete oure mynde and studye be sette all vpon it / settyng all caryeng a syde. lete vs be glad to yeue hem trewe coūseill freely for the auc∣toryte of frendes in that. whiche they aduyse wel / helpeth gretly in frendship / And somtyme that we shold aduerti∣se them not openly / but therwith sharply yf the caas re∣quyre it / And they shold obeye suche counseils dilygent∣ly / ffor I trowe dyuerse thynges right merueylous haue ben thought good / to suche men as emonge the grekes / that haue ben callyd right wyse / but ther is nothyng / that they ne fynde som faute in by their wylles / Som of them wolde / that a man sholde eschewe ouer grete plente of ffrendes / leste he allone shold be dryuen of necessite to ta∣ke care for many / it is ynowgh / and to moche somtyme they saye / to take hede to that. whiche belongeth to a man hym self / And to peyneful to be medelous in other mennes maters / and most behoefull to haue a slak reyne vpon frendship. That whan one will. he may restrayne it / or lete it loos at his playsyr. And they seye / the best thynge that may be to lyue welefully / is to be voyde of care / And that may not a man be. that trauaylleth and vexith his mynde for many. And some I here saye. spe∣ke more vncurtaysly / the whiche I haue somwhat said sharply to fore / They saye that frendship shold not be sought / for the getyng of loue / and good wille / but as
euery man is weykest and of leest power / so sholde he seke grettest frendshippis. or the frendshippe of grettest men. And by this meane as I trowe / that Sely wymmen sholde rather desire the helpe of frendship than men / And also they that were nedy / rather than they / that were / riche / & they that were wretchid / than they that were weleful / O lorde what this is a noble wisedom / fforsothe they are a∣boute to take the sonne oute of the firmament / that wold take frendship / fro the lyf of man / Syth we haue no∣thyng graunted vnto vs of god in this lyfe bettir or more Ioyous / What is this quyetenes of spiryte / that they speken of. At the first sight it is blaūdysshyng / but in veray dede in many tymes and many places / it is vt∣terly to be sette a syde. Ne it is not accordyng / that ther shold be ony worshipfull thyng or dede that ye coude take vpon you / or whan ye had it / to sette it a side withoute care & laboure of the mynde / ffor yf we will flee care / we muste flee vertue / ffor vertue muste nede haue some care to sette aside thyngis contrarye to hym / as bounte to sette a syde malyce / Attemperaunce luste / and force sluggisshnes / And that is the cause / that we see that they that be right wys. ben moest sory for the thynges / whiche be doon vn∣rihtwisly / And they that ben stronge for thynges doon vnlustely. And they that ben attēperat for thynges doon vicyously / And therfor it is very propre to hym. that hath a wel disposed courage / to be glad whan he seeth thynges wel doon / And to be sory for the contrarye. Thenne thus / yf a wiseman may be sory. the which must be nedes trewe / or lesse than we wille trowe / that ther is
no curtosye in ony wise mannes breste / what is the cause that we shold sette a side frendship so that we shold suf∣fre no peyne ne disease therfor. yf that we take fro man the moeuyng of his thoughtys / we shall not only take away the difference that is bytwene hym and a beest. but therwith the difference that is bytwene hym and a stocke or a stone / or ony lyke thynge. Ne they shold not be herd that saye / that vertu is hard and as it were made of yron / ffor as it is in many other thynges / and in especial in frendship / it is bothe tendre and tretable / So that for the wele of a mannes frende one enioyeth / & for his aduersi∣te he soroweth / Therfore this payne that is to be taken for our feendes / suffyseth not to dysseuere frendship for the lyf of man / no more than vertues. ffor that they can not be had withoute laboure and payne. shold be by all men re∣fused / And sythen vertue somtyme maketh frendshyp to kepe her within her self as I said afore / yf ther be ony to∣kene of vertue the whiche may appere / to the whiche the corage may applye And in hym self. as sone as euir he atteyneth vnto it / it must nedys be that loue therof spryn∣ge and growe / what may be more fowle. than the delyte in many vayne thynges / as in honour. and glorye. in byl∣dyng / in clothynge / and in the array of the body / and not to delyte in corage enriched with vertu. whiche may loue. and may be reclaymed to lyue vertuously / Ther is no∣thyng more plesaunt / than the reward for good wylle. or the nyghnes of studyes / and seruysablenes / And yf we adde this to that. whiche may right wel be added. that is to saye / that ther is nothyng that draweth ony thyng
vnto it / ne that holdeth it faster / than lyklynes draweth frendship. It shall be graunted forsothe as for trouth / that they whiche ben good / loue good folkes / and ioyne them vnto them / as yf they knytte vnto them in kynrede and nature / fforsothe ther is nothyng more desyrous of his lyke and semblable. or more cacchyng than is nature Therfor Faunyus and Seuola. I trowe veryly. that this is certayne / that emonge them that ben good / ther is a maner of necessarye benyuolence. the whiche is a veray naturel weel of frendship / but this same bounte bylongeth also to the multitude of the peple / ffor vertue is neyther vncurtoyse ne rewardlees / ne proude / whiche is wonte alwey. in the beste wise to counsaill and to defen∣de alle maner of paple / And that / vert shold not doo / yf she estraunged her self fro the loue of the comunyte / Al¦so me semeth· that they whiche will fourme frendship / after the shappe of prouffyt / they ben aboute to take a way the moost amyable knotte of frendship / ffor the prouffyt that is goten by a mannes frende. is not so delectable vnto hym. as the loue of his frende / ffor thenne that. whiche cometh of his frende is Ioyous vnto hym. whan he knoweth that it comyth of loue / And as gretly me thynketh discordyng with reason / that frendship shold only be vsed for prouffyt. as that they whiche habounde in all richesse and power / and in especial in vertu / in which is grettest sikernesse / And they I saye whiche haue leste nede of ony mannes helpe. shold be most liberall / and gladdest to doo good deedes / And als ferre as I knowe / ther lacked nothyng emonge frendes / ffor aftir that the
loue of frendship grewe bytwene me & Scipio / though he had had no nede of my coūseile or my helpe. eyther oute∣ward or at home / yet the frendshippis shold not haue ben the lasse / ffor this I saye you / that frendship foloweth not prouffyte. but prouffyte foloweth frendship / but tho men ben not to harde whiche folowe in delytes / whan that they will speke of frendship. of the whiche / they haue neyther vse ne knowleche / ffor who is that. that neyther coueiteth ne loueth ony othir man. ne is byloued of ony other man / though he had habondaunce of all other thyn∣ges / and were sette in moost folsom plente / how shold he lyue in this lyf that I spak of. is ther such lyf in tiraū∣tes / in whom is no fayth ne loue / ne ther may be in them the stablenesse of benyuolence. or ony truste / ffor they ha∣ue euery thynge suspecte. and ben full of thought and care / There is nothyng ne no place in them for frendhsip Neuirtheles they be worshippid for the tyme and dissy∣myled with all / ffor who sholde loue hym / that is dradde of alle men / and dredeth alle men hym self / And yf it fortune as it happeth ofte. that they falle from theyr as∣tate. thenne it is wel vndirstande. how grete nede they haue of frendship. As it is remembrid that Tarquy∣nus saide. wehan he was in his exile / that he vndirstode not / whom he myght truste. ne whom he myght mystruste / And therfore he myght thenke alle men lyke. Though the pryde of this Tarquynus and his inportunyte cau∣sed hym / that he had no frende / ne men of his maners myght haue no frendes / for richesse and power of them that be gretly myghty / exclude trusty frendshippes / ffor
fortune her self is not only blynde / whiche draweth to her suche as be hir seruauntis and clymbe vp to estate with lothnesse and contumacye of alle peple. And ther is no thynge more intollerable. than a infortunat foole / and that may sone be seen / by them that haue ben passyng riche that whan they haue be sette / in hygh estate. power and dygnyte. theyr condicions haue ben clene chaunged / And they haue forsaken theyr olde frendes / and taken theym to newe / What may be a more fonnysh̄ thyng than whan men haue grete plente of richesse / to pourueye such thynges as they doo / that is to saye moneye / horses / stately hous∣holdes / riche clothyng / precious plate / and forgete to pour∣ueye them of frendes / whiche is beste & the fayrest orna∣ment / that ony man may haue in this lyf. ffor whan they pourueye. of the said thynges that I spak of byfore They wote not / ffor whoos vse they pourueye. ne for whoos sake they take that laboure vpon them. ffor alle suche thynges falle for the more partye in to theyr handes that be moost myghty / But the possessions of frendship abyde certayn and stable to euery man / And though the goodes of fortune abyde with a man duryng his lyf / withoute frendship his lyf may neyther be fruytfull ne mery. And this suffyseth as hyderto: rEason wolde now that we putt thendes and boundes of frendship. lyke as they were the termes and boundes of loue. of the whiche I haue vndirstonde thre opynyons / And of them I appro∣ue neuir one / One is that we shold loue our frende als
affectuously as our self / Another that our benyuolence ayenst oure frendes. may answere euenly to the benyuo∣lence / whiche they bere ayenst vs / The thirde. that who someuer / one maketh moche of hym self / so moche he shold be made of. by his frendys. And I can not agree / with none. of thise thre opynyons / ne the fyrst of theym is trewe. ffor ther be many thynges whiche we will. not doo for our self / that we doo for our frendes / That is to saye praye hym lowly that is byneth vs / or to speke sharply or to blame hym gretly / the which thynges be not honest in our owen causes / & ben most honeste in the causes of our frendes / Ther be also many thynges / in whiche wel dis∣posed persones take awey moche of theyr owen prouffy∣tes. And suffre to be taken away. ffor that theyr frendes shold vse them to theyr playfyre / rather than them self / That other opynyon is. whiche diffyneth frendship by parilite of duete and playser. And forsothe that is to skante. to calle his frende so wyckedly to a counte / that the reason of that / whiche is to taken / and that whiche is to yeuen be euen. but veray frendship as it semeth me / it is rather and more plentyuouse / ffor that taketh not so streyte heed / that ther be gyuen no more than taken / Ne that fereth not to gretly / lest that ony thynge excede / and falle besyde / or that yere be yeuen to a frende / no more than is nedeful and euen / The thirde terme or ende that they sette is worst of alle / And that is how moche a man maketh of hym self. so moche he shold be made of· by his frende / ffor ofte it happeth / that some persones / haue not so noble & so hye courage as some haue / ne that haue not
so ferme hope of thencrece of fortune· as som haue / therfor it sittith not a frende to be such one / ayenst an other man as he is ayenst hym self. But rather to payne hym self / and to doo so / that he maye lyfte vp the lowe courage of his frende. and may brynge hym better hope and more quycke remembraunce. But we muste lymyte an other ende to frendship / But fyrst I shal telle you. what Sci∣pio was wonte most to repreue / he seide. ther myght in no wise be thought more ful of enemyte than the wis of hym. which said that a man shold loue in such wyse / as· yf it happeth hym somtyme to hate in the same place / ne he coude not byleue that Byas sholde saye so. which was so wyse holde & one of the seuen wyse / how be it that men tro∣wed so / but that rather / it shold be the sayeng of somother Impure and ambycious persone / or of suche one / that wolde haue called alle thynge to his power / ffor in what wyse shold one be frende vnto hym / whom he hath in a wayte / And troweth alwey he shold be his enemye / ffur¦thermore it shold be necessarye to suche a man / to coueyte and desire / to take his frende ofte with defawtes / that he maye haue gretter cause to chyde hym / And besyde that· it must nedes folowe / that they shold ofte take disple∣saūtly / and sorowe and enuye / whan theyr frende doth wel And is in his wele / Therfore that precept Who so euer gaf it / was good to sette frendship a syde. he shold haue rather haue commaunded that we shuld haue put to our dilygences / to haue goten many fren∣des leste we shold happen. to loue some one / Whom we
sholde hate soone aftir. And Scipio thought that yf we were not alle therm ost happy vnto frendes / We shold rather suffre it paciently. than thynke vpon the tyme / Whan we shold be theyr enemyes / Therfore I trowe we shold vse / and take this for the lymytes and boundes of frendship / that whan the maners of our frendes ben good. that we shold comune thenne with them. alle our counseills thynges and pleasirs without ony excepcion. that yf it shal happe by ony fortune. that theyr pleasirs. which ben not alle the moost / leefful / And in theym the peryll of worship and fame dependeth / It is thenne for a frende / to kepe hym self absente / yf that he see that hys grete shame shold folowe therof / ffor though the errour of a man may be pardonned in that / that he doth for his frende / yet a mannes owne fame shold neuir be foryeten. The benyuolence of peple must nedes be trowed a grete helpe / for the spede of promocyon of thynges / And yet to gete the same benyuolence / by meane of flaterye and assentacyon. is right fowle and shamefull / vertue of whiche is but a fewe / is not to be sette a syde / But now I tourne agayn to Scipio. whos speche in sub∣staunce was alle of frendship / ffor he complayned gretly. that men were moche more dilygente / in alle maner of thynges than in chesyng of frendes. ffor eue∣ry man coude telle / How many sheep. and how many gheet he had / But how many frendes they had. they coude not telle / And to gete to them grete plente of be∣staylle / they toke grete labour and payne. but in getyng of frendes. they shewed them / slowe and neclygente
And byfore that they shold bye theyr beestys / they had certayn markes / to knowe whether they were good or noo / But in chesyng of frendes / they can not take suche markes to knowe / whiche be to truste and chose. and whiche not / Neuerthelesse late vs saye / that they whiche be stable ferme and constaunt ben to be chosen for fren∣des / Of whiche maner of people / ther is grete scarcete / And certayn it is right harde for ony man. on lesse he be experte. to discerne wel in suche chesynges / ffor a man muste take experyence / in the sel̄f tyme of frendshippe. and that is passyng harde / ffor frendship suffreth no such essaye / it belongeth therfore a wiseman to suffre the force of benyuolence / suche as he shuld vse / as he suffreth his shippe to saylle / And assaye the manrs of his frendes in maner as he that essayeth his shippe in a tempest. Somme ben soone espyed in lytil habondaunce / how light they be / And some that wil not be meuid in lytil thynges ben knowen in gretter / It may happen some men to be founden. that wil deme it a fowle thynge to sette more by money / than by frendship / But where shal we fynde them. whiche wil not sette more by worship / go∣uernaunce / souerayntes / power / and habondaunce of goodes. than by frendship / So that yf this thyng for∣said were sette on that one syde. of a man / And frendship in that other syde / that wold not chese rather worshippes / gouernaunces / &c. than suche frendship / ffor sothe nature is to weack to flee the desyre of power and worship / and though men somtyme foryete frendship to atteyne to a gretter auctoryte / they trowe them self in
that byhalue to fynde a good excuse. whyle that they may saye / that they foryete not frendship. but for a grete and a worthy cause / Therfore no doubte of. it is passyng hard to fynde verry frendship / in theym whiche ben conuersaūt in hye courtes / or in thastate publyque / ffor where maye we fynde hym. that will rather put his frende to worship than hym self / and to sette asyde alle suche thynges. how greuous and how hard it is semed to many to entre frendshipe with them whiche be in aduersyte / Enny∣us said truly. whan he saide / a certayne frende is knowen in vncertayn seasons / But ther ben two thynges whiche proue in many men lyghtnes / and vnsurenesse. & that is whan they despise theyr frende for prosperyte / or forsake hym in aduersyte / Therfor who so euir can in eyther of tho two thynges shewe hym self witty stable & constant in frendship. we may Iuge hym of that kynrede of men. whiche is moost seldom founde / I had almost saide that he is comen of goddes / ffeyth is foundement or sikernesse of the stablenesse & constaūce that we seken in frendship / ffor ther is nothyng stable. that is feythles / It is thēne cōuenient to chese a frende such as is not double. & thēne take prosperite & aduersite in comune with hym that che∣seth hym. & can cōsente with hym in liuyng. & that can be meuid to lyke thyngis as he is meuid for a croked & a va¦riaūt witte may neuir be feithful / ne he which is meuid to doo such thynges / as his frende is meuid to doo / or hath a lyke disposicion in nature. may eyther be siker or stable / And we may adde to this / that a frende / shold not delyte in complayntes to be brought vnto hym. or yeue credence
to suche as be brought vnto hym / Alle the whiche thyn∣ges apperceyue to that constaunce that I spak of right now / And so it is trewe that I saide in the begynnyng How frendship maye not be. but bytweyne suche as ben good. It sitteth a good man / whom we may calle a wise man to kepe two thynges in frendship / the fyrst thynge is that ther is nothynge feyned ne dissymiled. ffor it sit∣teth rather a worshipfull persone rather to shewe his dis∣playsaunce & hate openly / than to hyde it with a sleyght looke / The seconde is that a man shold not onely sette a syde such complayntes as be brought to hym of his frende but therwith sette a syde all such suspecion as he myght haue of his frende. by the whiche he sholde mowe trowe. that frendship were hurte or defoylled Also ther had nede to be / bytwene frendes a maner of swetnesse of speche and maners / the whiche thynge maketh frendship not a lytil the more sauery / ffor sorowe and seueryte ben in alle wyses to be eschewed in frendship. Sorowe hath greuosnesse Ioyned with hym / And frendship shold be the more remysse / more free. and swetter / and more redy to alle benygnyte and facilyte of maners / but now in this place ther is a lytil hard question / Whether that newe frendes / And suche as be worthy the name of frendship / be / to be proferryd a mannes olde frendes. As we are not wonte rather to chese coltes / than horses of seuen yere for our rode / but ther shold no man doubte in this ffor ther is not suche fulsomnesse in frendship. as ther is in other thynges / ffor frendship fareth as wine / which may be kepte many yeres / ffor the more foylles / that the wyne
is of. the more plesaunt it is in drynkyng / And sothe it is that is said. how men maye ete many busshellis of salt. or they parfyte or accomplysshe theyr dutee of frendship. The noueltees of frendship shold not be for∣saken / yf that they be suche / as a man may hope wel of. nomore than newe herbes / whiche deceyue not men of suche fruyt as they shall brynge forth / But thantyquyte of frendship shold be kept alwey in his owne place. ffor the force of Antyquyte and customme is alwey grettest / yf no thynge lette it / as I made mencion right now of the hors / ffor there is no man. but had leuer ride vpon an hors that is broken. And knoweth his hond on the brydle / than vpon that / whiche is not broken. or on whoos bak he cam neuir byfore / Soo customme hath grete strength not only in beestys. But also in thynges whiche haue noo felynge / ffor we delyte vs in holy pla∣ces / And suche as ben sette in woodes / in whiche we haue longe dwellid / but the chief thynge / that is in frendship / Whan he that is in superyoryte lyketh to make hym self egall with his frendes. oftyme / There ben certayne excellences suche as Scipio had in oure companye / And yet he putt Philus and Rutilyus / And Mummyus euer afore hym / And dyuerse other of his frendes. whiche were of lower estate. And he worshippid Quintus his oldest brother. Whiche was nothynge lyke hym / As his better by reason of his age / And he coueyted to haue alle his frendes in gretter reuerence and in more ample es∣tate than hym self· In whiche thynge / euery man
folowe Scipion so / yf they haue goten the preemynence of vertue / of nature / or fortune / they sholde departe it with theyr frendes / And comyne with them / that ben next to them / As yf they be born of lowe kynne / or yf they haue weake frendes / they shold eyther by meane of counseill / or by meane of liberalyte encreace theyr ha∣uours / as it is tolde in the fables / how certayne men were resceyued in to seruyse· theyr byrthe and kynne vnknowen. And at laste it was founden. and they knowen for the sones of goddes and kynges / And yet kepe & now theyr fauour and good will to suche shep∣herdes as yet lyue. and had theyr faders dede many ye∣res passyd / the whiche thynge is moche rather to be doo / ayenst suche as haue faders knowen and certayne. The grettest fruyte of naturel vertue / and alle excellence is thenne taken / Whan it is youen and departed to theym that be next in frendship and good wille / And they that ben souerayns / in the nyghnesse of frendship and ioyne good wylle. sholde make them self egall with theym. that ben lower than they / so as they that be bynethe theym· haue no cause to sorowe / that they be ouercomen by theyr frendes / in wisedome / fortune / or estate / Of the whiche for the more parte / many com∣playne vpon suche thynges or obreyde theyr frendes therwith / And so moche the rather / they thynke theyr frendes so moche more byholden to theym / that they may telle how studyously. how frendely and laboryously they haue doon for theym / In good trouthe it is an hatefull maner of men / whiche lyste ofte to obreyde theyr frendes
of such thynges as they doo for theym / ffor he that recey∣ueth suche benefaytes shold remembre. and not he that gaf theym. Therfore they that are the soueraynes / owe to submytte theym self in frendsyip / and in maner exalte theym / whiche ben lower than them self / But ther ben some that maken frendship right greuous. whan they trowe that men sette lytle by theym. And that happeth not comunely. but in such as trowe theym self that they shold be lytil sette by. And they shold be eased of that oppynyon. not only in wordes but in dede / we shulde yelde vnto euery frende / first als moch as he myght susteyne & receyue / whom we loue and wil helpe / ffor we may not doo vnto our frendes by our meanes ouer moch ample wor∣shippes. As Scipio whiche myght by his meanes ma∣ke Publius Rutilius Consull / but he myght not make his brother Lucius so / And what yf we myght doo so to ony other / yet it is to be seen / whether he may wel take it vpon hym / The Iugement of frendship shold alwey be had / whan the wyttes of thaages of men ben in gret∣test force. and moost hole and syker. ffor it is not spede∣ful / that yf ony childeren in the thendrenesse of theyr yeres haue lyke corage and disposicion / to pleyeng atte tenyce or huntyng / that they haue theym in mooste nygh of courage / and chief of fauour whiche ben of semblable desires and studyes / or by that reason nourices and Scolemaistres by reason of olde seruyse muste aske benyuolence right largely / And they shold not be forgo∣ten / But there is maner in the cherisshyng of theym without comformyte of maners / ffor frendship may not
be stable. ffor the dyuersyte of maners causeth the dyuer∣syte of loues / ffor as symylytude ioyned frendshippes / so dissimylytude disseuerith them / And it is for none other cause / that good men may neuir be frendes with suche as be noughty / But for that / that there is als grete a dis∣taunce / or difference bytwene theyr maners and studyes Also it may be a good precept in the lawe of frendship / that no man by a maner of his intemperate benyuolence lette the grete wele. that shold growe to his frendes / ffor yf I shal turne agayn to fables / Neptholonius myght neuir haue wonne Troye / yf he wolde haue herde licomedes / in whoos hous he was nourisshed / whiche laboured with shedyng of many teerys to haue letted his purpoos. ffor oftymes grete thynges happen casully to make men de∣parte fro theyr frendes. And many chese for to departe rather than they shold be letted of theyr purpoos / without hieryng of theyr frendes / leste yf they herde them. they coude not saye nay to theyr desires. And suche a man who so euir he be / is of ouer freall / and ouer softe a nature / And for that cause he is not veray Iuste in frendship / But it is to be considered in euery thynge / what we aske of our frende / And what we will suffre to be asked of our self & assethed / Ther is also a certayne calamyte or obscurite full oftymes necessarye in departyng of frend∣shippis / But now oure speche is & shall falle from the famylyarytees of wise men to comune frendlyhedes / The defawte of frendes breke oute and shewe as wel to them which be ioyned to theym in frendship / as to other folkes in the disclaundre therof / and redoundeth not only vnto
them. whiche haue the same vices / But also to theym whiche be theyr frendes. And suche frendshippis shold be eased lytyl and lytyle by slacknesse of customme and familyaryte / And as I haue herd Cato saye / they shold rather be vnripped / than rente asondre / on lesse than suche wronge. as may not be suffered disseuere the said frend∣ship. so that it shold be thought neyther reasonable ne worshipfull· ne that it myght be other wise / but that the said estraungyng and disionction muste forthwith be made / But take me now as I said a lytyle byfore / that I speke not now of the frendshippes of wise men. but of the comune frendshippes / yf ther happen to be a maner of chaunge / in maners and studyes / as it happeth ofte. ffor such debate as falleth in the partes of our estate publyque it is to be taken hede of. Thise frendshippes only be not layd a part / but that grete enemytees be taken in honde & bygonne. And yet ther is nothynge forsothe more fowle than to make werre with hym / with whom we haue lyued alwey byfore famylyarly / Ye knowe wel / how Scipio departed from the frendship of Quintus Pompeus for my sake / And how he was estraunged from his felawe named Methellus / for suche debate as was in oure estate publyque / And he dyde in bothe thynges wittyly / And by no sharp auctorite or offencion of his courage propre / But herfore I saye / we sholde take grete hede. that ther falle no debates emonge oure frendes / And yf ther happen ony such thynges / we shold laboure that frendship shold rather be softly quenchid than oppressyd / we sholde in alle wise beware. leste grete frendshippes torne them self in to grete
enemytees / of the whiche / debates / cursed wordes and stry∣ues enfiewe. Neuirtheles yf they be tollerable / they muste be suffred / And we shold yeue this worship to olde frend∣ship. that he be thought rather in the blame that doth the wronge / than he that suffreth it / There is one prouysyon & one meane to beware of alle suche vices. and incommo∣dytees. And that is that we be not to hasty in the set∣tyng of our loue / ne that we loue suche / as be not worthy to be loued / They ben worthy frendship in whom ther be worshipful causes / whiche sholde make vs to loue them. but they be selde founden / And so be alle thynges whiche be worshipful. And ther is nothynge more harde to fynde than that / whiche is parfyt in his owen kynde / in euery behalue. But for the more part / men lyste to call nothyng good in humayne thynges / but suche as is fruytfull / And so they loue their frendes· as they loue their beestys ffor such as they suppose / they shal haue moost fruyte of. them they cherysshe moost / And therfor they lacke the moost naturell and fayrest frendship / whiche is not to be desired / but by hit self / and for hit self / This is the ver∣ry force of frendship / and the qualite / and the quantite of the same euery man loueth hym self / and loketh aftir no reward for his loue / ffor euery man for his owen sake is dere ynough to hym self / And onlesse that the said and the same dernesse and loue may be vsed in frendship a verray frende shal neuir be founde / ffor he is as though it were another than the same / And yf that appereth in beestys and fowles bredyng in the woodes. or in the wa∣ters tame or wilde. that fyrst they loue theym self / ffor
that is a thyng. that is innate vnto eueriche that hath lyf Secundly that they seke and desire suche beestys as they wolde couple them self with. and be of the same kynde / And that they doo with grete desire. and with a maner of lykenesse of the loue of men. how moche more it is caused by nature in a man. that he sholde loue hym self / and gete hym another / whos will he shold medle with his / that of tho tweyne he shold make wel nygh one / But many men ful cursedly / I wil not saye vnshame∣fastly / refuse to haue suche a frende / ffor they can not be suche one theym self. And they desire of theyr frendes suche thynges / as they wolde not departe with them self / at theyr frendes desire / It is resonable that a man first make hym self a good man. and thenne seke another lyke hym self / And in suche tweyne that stablenesse of frendship that we trete of byfore may be confermed / whan men ioyned to gydre in benyuolence can gete the soue∣raynte of suche lustes / as other men be seruauntes vnto / and sette theyr ioye in equyte and Iustice / Thenne that one shal haue of that other / but that / whiche is rightuo{us} and worshipful / ne they shal not only eyther of them worshippe other. but therwith they shal loue to gyders with a maner of shamefastnesse / ffor who so euir takyth away shamefastnesse from frendship / taketh awey the grettest ornament that frendship hath / Therfor ther is grete and malycious errour in theym / whiche trowe surely that frendship yeueth fredom & lyberte to alle luste And syn syth frendship is ordeyned by nature to be the helper of vertue / and not the felawe to vyce / ffor solytary
vertue may not it self atteyne to such thynges as ben hy∣ghest. but ioyned and felawshipped with other. it myght atteyne. the whiche felauship yf it be / haue ben / or shal be bytwene ony men / that felauship is to be holden & repu∣ted best / and moost blessyd to brynge theym to the hyghest weele of nature / In this I saye is the felauship / in which alle thynges ben / which men coude suppose shold be desired And that is worship / glorye / and thease of spiryte and Ioyousnesse / And where thise thynges be / the lyf is bles∣syd / And without theym it ne may be blessyd. Thenne syth that it is beste and moost chief / yf we wil atteyne ther vnto / We must yeue ourself to vertue / withoute the whiche we may neyther come by frendship ne no thynge / that shold be of vs desired / ffor vertu sette a syde / who som euer troweth that he hath frendes. he shal thēne knowe fyrst how he is deceyued / whan he is constrayned to assaye ad∣uerse fortune / Therfor we may saye. whan ye haue preued. thenne loue / And not whan ye haue loued. thenne to preue But syth we be punysshed for our neclygence in many thynges / yet we be chiefly punysshed for the neclygence of the worshippyng and louyng of our frendes in our ad∣uyses takyng / we vse a contrary ordre / ffor though we be entriked by one meane / or by another / eyther by longe fa∣mylyaryte / or with thadmynystracion of oure dutees / yet we breke sodeynly / in the myddes of our frendshippis / som tyme for lytil offence. And so grete a neclygence in that thyng / that is moost necessarye / is gretely to be dispray∣sed / Frendship forsothe is the thynge to be sette allone in thastate of man. and thutilite of commodyte. wherof
alle men ben of one oppinnyon / though the same vertue be despised of many whiche calle it. but a thynge sette to sale and ostentacion There be many that despyse richesse And they ben suche as holde theym content with lytil. And delyte them in poure food and poure arraye / And some despise worship. by the desyre of whiche / many men ben sette / a fyre / And suche men trowe as despise it / that ther is nothynge more waueryng ne more vnstable than the same / And so it happeth in other thynges many men sette no prys by that / that other men make moost of / But alle men acorde in thoppinyon of frendship / ffor they that yeuen them self to thastate publyque / or they that delyte them in the knowleche and doctryne of ma∣ny thynges. And they that ben besyly ocupyed aboute theyr owne erandes / And yf I shal ioyne them to the re∣menaūt / they that yeuen them self alle to lustes and de∣lytes / trowe and fele that ther is no lyf withoute frend∣ship / namely yf they wil lyue in ony parte lyberally and Ioyously / Frendship crepith I woote not how in to the lyues of alle men / And it suffreth none age be partelees of hym / but yf so be that ony be of sharp or cruel entente and nature. that he flee and hateth the metyng & felaw∣ship of men / so as one dyde at Athenes a namelees man almoost. sauf that he hyght Thymo / yet he myght not suffre / but that he muste haue one to disclose vnto. the horribylyte of his sharp lyf. And this myght be best proued / yf it myght happen / that god wol̄de take vs from the conuersacion of men. and sette vs somwhere in wyl∣dernesse / And there yeue vs habundance and plente / of
alle thyng that nature coude desyre. And therwith take from vs the sight and vse of alle men. who coude be foū∣de so harde that coude endure that lyf / or fro whome that beyng allone shold not take the fruyte of alle plesaunce / Therfore it is ful trewe that Tarentinus Archita was wonte to saye / the whiche our olders were wont to telle vs / as they herde telle of theyr olders. yf ony man had ascended in to heuen. and beholden the nature of the world And the beaute of the sterres. that whiche he had seen of merueyle. sholde be in no wise plesaunt to hym / yf he had none / to whom he myght disclose that he had seen / the which thynge ellys / that is to saye. yf he had a frende to whom he myght disclose it / that shold be to hym the thynge of moost souerayne plesaunce· So nature loueth nothynge that is solytary· ffor it leneth alwey to some one thyng that it wil reste vpon / And where can it more surely res∣te / than in that thynge. whiche is moost frendely to it / But whan nature declareth by so many sygnes / what she wold haue / what she seketh / and what she desireth / we wexe deef / I woote not how / for we wil not here / whan she aduer∣tyseth vs. The vse of frendship is dyuerse & manyfolde and so ther be many causes of suspecion and displesaunce the whiche to eschewe / to ease / and to bere / is a wyse man∣nes parte / But ther is one maner of displesaunce / that shold be paciently born / And that is whan one frende for the proffyte & feyth which shuld be reteyned in frendship suffreth a maulgre. ffor frendes shulde ofte be warned & blamed resonably / And such warnynges and blamynges shold be taken benyuolently & frendely. But I wote not
how it is trewe / that Terence sayth in his comedye na∣med Andria / folowyng of playsyr geteth frendes / And trouthe hate. Trouthe is greuous / for of it cometh hate / whiche is the poyson of frendship / but folowyng of play∣syre. is moche more greuous. whiche suffreth synne vn¦blamed / and maketh a mannes frende renne hedlynges in to myschief / But the grettest faute that maye be in a man / is to despise trouthe / and to be by folowyng of play∣sire wilfully led in to deceyte· Therfore diligence and reason is to be had in this byhalue. ffirst that our aduer∣tisement to oure frende be not sowre / And next that / bla∣mynge be withoute chydyng / And lete vs vse benygnyte in folowyng of playsyr / That word I vse gladly / syth Terence vsid the same / But byfore alle thyng / lete vs flee assentacion in frendship / whiche is the promoter of vice / the whiche not onely a frende. but euery good man sholde eschewe it / It is not all one to lyue with a tiraunt and to lyue with a frende / but close his eeres / whan it is spoken / his heale is to be dispraysed / Of the sayeng of Cato is wel knowen. how sharpe enemyes / meryte moche more of some men / than suche as semen theyr swete fren∣des / ffor the fyrst saye for the more parte trouthe / And that other neuir· And that is a fowle thynge that they whiche be amonesshyd by theyr frendes / take not suche displesaunce / as they sholde take / but take suche displesaū∣ce as they shold lacke / ffor it greueth them not / that they haue synned· but it greueth them gretly to be blamed for it / And it shold be alle other wyse / ffor they shold sorowe for theyr offence / and be glad to to corrected / It is verray
propre to frendship / to warne and to be warned / & he that is the warner shold warne benygnely / curtaysly / and not sharply / And he that is warned / shold take it pacyently & not obstynatly / Thus we shold holde / that ther is not a gretter sore in frendship. than adulacion. flatery / & as∣sentacion· loo how many names this vyce hath. hit syt∣teth to suche men / as ben lyght & deceyuable / to saye alle thyng acordyng to playsyr· and nothyng to trouthe / syth the dyssymylyng in alle thynge is vicious. ffor it taketh away and corrupteth the Iugement of trouthe / yet in e∣special it is vicious / for that it is so contrary to veray frendship / ffor it setteth a syde trouthe / withoute the whiche. frendship may be of no valewe. ffor syth the force of frendship resteth in that / that one wylle shold be made of many wylles / how maye it be so made / yf one wille be not in one man. ne yet the same alwey / but variaunt. ma¦nyfolde· and meuable / what thyng may be so flexible or so redy to bowe / as the wille of hym that is redy to chaūge / not only by the felyng and the wille of another man· but also at his chere & contenaūce / Some men wil denye this. wel I denye it / he sayth so / I saye the same / but what sayth he. I haue maystred so my self / that I wil assente in all thynges / as the same Terence sayth / but I speke this in the persone of Enato / but to entende to this ma∣ner of frendship. hit becometh best such as be lyght / Ther be many lyke Enato / whan they be in place of fortune & fame aboue other / but theyr assentacion is to greuous / namely whan auctorite is ioyned to vanyte / but a flate∣ryng frende / may as wel be knowen & vnderstanden from a trewe frende / yf a man put to due dilygence / as alle
thynges which be coloured & dyssymiled maye be knowen fro suche as be pure & veray in that coūseill that rested of leest wise men / one may soone put difference bytwene hym that is a flaterer / & a lyght cytezeyn / & hym that is con∣staūt sadde & wytty / with what flatery entryd Cueyus papirius in to the eeres of our coūseyll / whan he brought in the lawe to renouell the trybunes of the peple / but we ad¦uertised the contrarye / of my self I wil not speke / but of Scipio with a good will / O almyghty god how grete wytte / & how grete mageste was in his oracion / that men shold rather take hym for a prynce / than for a felowe of the peple of rome / but ye were presente / & his oracōn is in your hondes / so that lawe / that shold haue be made for the fa¦uour of the peple / by the suffrages of the same people was putt a backe / but now to torne agayn / where I was ye be wel remēbred / But Quintiuus maximus brother to Scipio / & Lucius Manilius beyng cōsuls. how gretely plesaūt was semed in the lawe made by Cueius lucinius Cressus entitled de Sacerdocijs to the people / wherin the reformacion of the collegis was brought to the bene∣fayte of the peple / And he ordeygned fyrst to haue to doo in his cause with the people in the open place / and yet the relygion of the goddes Inmortall my self defendyng it. ouercam lyghtly his vendyble oracion / & that was doon by me whyles I was pretor / so that cause was rather de∣fended for the Iustnesse of it / than by ony hye auctoryte. Thenne yf so be that in that place. Where that oure tragedyes ben played / Where that countrefete and coloured thynges haue grete place. that it whiche is

Also it is caused thaugh ye ea∣sely folowe it / that we yonge men haue loued thise men whiche were right aged / Lucius Paulus / Marcus Ca¦to Cueius Gallus. Publius Nassica. Titus Grac∣cus fader in lawe to our Scipio / but frendship sheweth most bryght. whan it is emonges them / whiche ben of e∣gall yeres / as bytwene me & Scipio / Lucius Fucius Publius Rutilius and Spurius Mumius Some whyle we aged men reste in the benyuolence of them / whiche ben toward the world. as it fareth by me / whiche delyte in the famylyaryte of Quintus Tubero. whiche is as who sayth yonge / And Publius Rutilius / ffor it is acordyng to the reason of oure nature and lyf / that one age succede another / but we shold naturelly moste de∣sire that we myght come alwey. at the heeles of theym / that we were lete out with to roue first / but syth the thyn¦ges of men ben freal & fallyng / we sholde peyne vs / to gete some suche / as we myght loue truly / And of whom we myght be also trewly beloued men / ffor whan loue and benyuolence ben taken aweye from oure lyf / alle gladnes and comforte goth with the same / ffor Scipio though he were sodeynly take awey fro me / as to me warde

We dwellyd in one hows. Oure maner of lyuynge was all one / In tyme of werre we were to gydres / In talkyng of our dis∣portes and pylgremages doyng we neuir disseuered / And what shal I saye of our studyes / the whiche we vsed to knowe or to lerne alwey somwhat. and in the which / whan we were fro the syght of the peple. we spente all our voy∣de tymes / And yf the remembraunce & hye memorye had dyed with hym / I myght in no wise bere the absence of hym. to whom I was moost nygh knytte / & he of me best byloued / but these thynges be not dede / but rather norysshed & encreaced by the thought & remembraūce that I haue of hym. & though all tho thynges were take away fro me / yet
myn age dooth me grete comforte / I may not now longe lyue in this desyre. Alle shorte thynges / though they be grete / they shold be tollerable / Thise thynges I haue had whiche I myght saye vnto you of frendship. Now I ex¦horte you / that ye so sette vertue / withoute the whiche / frendship may not be / that excepte the same ye deeme that nothynge may be better than frendship. Thus endeth this boke named Tullius de Amicicia / whiche treateth of frendship vtterid and declared by a noble senatour of Rome named Lelyus vnto his two sones in lawe also noble men of rome named Faunyus & Seuola. In which they desyred hym to enforme them of the frendship / that was bytwene the said Lelius and the noble prynce Scipio Affrican. wherin he hath answe∣red & tolde to them the noble vertues that ben in frendship And withoute vertue veray frendship may not be. as he preuyth by many exsamples and notable conclusions as here to fore is moch playnly expressyd & said all a longe / whiche werke was translated by the vertuous and no∣ble lord and Erle / therle of worcestre. on whoos sowle I bechese almyghty god to haue mercy / And Alle ye that shal rede or here this said werke of your charyte I beseche you to praye for hym. And by cause this said book de Amicicia is ful necessarye and requysyte to be had and knowen. I haue putt it in emprynte / to thentent / that veray Amyte and frendship may be had
as it ought to be in euery estate and degree / And vertue withoute whiche frendship may not be had· may be encre∣aced▪ and vices eschewid· Thenne whan I had enprynted the book of olde age / whiche the said Tullyus made / me semed it acordyng that this said booke of frendship shold folowe / by cause / ther can not be annexed to olde age a bettir thynge / than good and very frendship. which two said bokes here to fore wreton ben of grete wisedom and auctoryte / And full necessarye bohoeffull and requysite vnto euery age estate and degree / And that they prouf∣fyte in encreacyng of vertue / I beseche the blessyd Try∣nyte to geue and graunte vnto alle them that shal rede & here thise bokes / And so to flee & eschewe vices & syn∣nes / that by the merytes of vertuouse honeste / and good werkes / we may atteyne aftir this shorte / transytorye lyf the eternall blessyd lyf in heuen / where is ioye and glorye withoute ende. Amen.
Here foloweth the Argument of the declamacyon / which laboureth to shewe. wherin honoure sholde reste: wHan Thempyre of Rome moste flou∣red / And was in the age of his force and strengthe. The fame of one named Ful∣geus / was right ferre spredde to his grete worship. ffor he was right eurous to ri∣chesse / honoure / and frendship / Also gretly riche as wel of the grace and good wille of alle the Cyteseyns of Rome / as of other gyftes of fortune / And he had by his wyf named Claudea a doughter of surmountyng beaute called and named Lucresse / whiche was thonly hope of his comforte and sustentacion in the yeres of his age / fer besyde her merueyllous beaute. wherin she excelled alle the vyrgyns of Rome in tho dayes / Ther was in her so gre∣te attemperaūce of lyf / with so worshipful conduyt of ma¦ners / so grete force of wisedom / with so plenteuous vnder¦standyng of lectrure / that it shewed her to lacke nothyng / that coude be wylled or wesshed ony worshipful creature to haue of honoure or vertue / Neuertheles emong many that hertly loued her. ther were tweyne in especial. which dayly more & more / brenned in the loue of fayre Lucresse· And bytwene them was lytil difference in semelynesse of persone· or age. But theyr maners and fortune were gretely different. The one of them and the fyrst was named Publyus Cornelius / of the worshipful hows
and stocke called Cornelij / And he habounded gretely in the goodes of fortune· ffor though he was noble of byrthe Yet therto he was gretely stuffed of Richesse. wel fur∣nysshed of frendes / his housholde plenteuously garnysshed of seruauntes / and all apparaylmentys in those dayes vsed / And his grete studye rested in huntyng. haukyng syngyng / & disporte / That other & the seconde whiche hyghte Gayus Flamyneus was born of a lo∣wer stocke. And he had moderate Richesse / resonable plen∣te of that / as apperteyned to an housholde / or thapparay∣lyng of the same / how be it / he had moch better & more wor¦shipfull fortune / And that not withstondyng / he shewed hym self neuir the more slack in that he shold doo / Pay∣nyng hym self alwey to floure in vertue and good ma∣ners / but his grete studye was with his dilygence and seyse. to helpe his frende and contrey / whan eyther of them had nede of his helpe. In tyme of werre he shewed hym self manly & corageo{us} / And in tyme of peas right besye and laboryous in his bokes / so that in tyme of wer∣re / he was furnysshed of counseylle / And he counseylled nothynge but suche as hym self ful lyke a man wolde take his parte in / he excellyd gretely in attemperaunce of lyuyng. prudence / and eloquence / aboue that. it was cre∣dyble / or coude be supposyd in ony of his yeres / And of the said noble vertues / he was gretely praysed of alle the people of Rome / Hit fortuned thise two yong men. to mete of auenture at the hous of this Fulgeus / fader vn¦to fayre Lucresse / theyr ententes and causes of comynge lyke as it was proued by theyr ouerture / was that eyther
of theym desired in as goodly langage as he coude / the good will and parfyght fauour of Fulgeus. touchyng his doughter Lucresse / so as she myght owe her fauour to hym in especiall byfore ony other / Thus eyther of theym desired Lucresse / and her fader vnderstandyng theyr play¦syrs wente for to haue speche with his doughter / to then∣tente to gyue theym answere. And whan he had declared to fayre Lucresse the honorable desires of thise two lusty yonge Romaynes / And consydered wel that his dough∣ter was in the flour of her yeres / he yaf to her his fadrely aduys· that she shold entende to maryage / & sette her herte vpon one of thies tweyne. that is to saye Publius Cor¦nelius or Gayus Flamyneus / And Lucresse first with a shamefast countenaunce. whan she herde her faders declaracyon and aduyse / excused her full humbly and wo∣manly shewyng her self to be alle other wise sette / But her fader charged her so streytly / that her excuse in that by∣halue. myght take no place / Ne other meane was none. but that she muste chese one of thise tweyne. that is to wytte / eyther Publius or Gayus / And thenne delybera¦on taken with her self / this was her fynal answere / Thanswere of Lucresse vnto her fader. rYght worshipful fader of me youre humble doughter best byloued and moost drad. I dar in no wyse disobeye your commaūdement ye∣uen vnto me / on your blessynge / I praye you chese for me / and to your sone in lawe / the more noble of
bothe. vpon the whiche her answere / ther grewe grete con∣trauersye bytwene thies two yong Romaynes· and gre∣te herte brennyng / whiche of theym tweyne sholde haue be counted for more noble / And for as moche as lyke thyn∣ges had not be seen byfore / And that thanswere of Lu∣cresse was openly publysshed / the mater was brought by fore the Senate / where eyther of theym had suche langa∣ge for his parte by waye of Oracion as ensieweth / The Oracion of Publius Cornelius Scipio. sYth it is so that my lady.

Ye ffaders conscript / whiche of you is he. that vnderstandeth openly / how Pub∣lius Cornelius Scipio born and descended. of the no∣ble and worshipful blood and hous of the Cornelyes. muste by alle reason and right. haue and enioye the glo∣rye of this moost goodly choyse. who is he wel aduysed that doubted that / to be noblesse / whiche we take of the stocke / of oure worthy olders / syth they lefte that / vnto theyr heyres and successours· as the richest parte of theyr enherytaunce / ffor whan they haue atteyned the fame of worshipful dedes / by them parfyghted. and deserued laude of knyghtly disciplyne. ripe maners / grete vertue / and hygh glorye / and haue meryted a name bryght and In∣mortal / with hye and grettest worshippes. that they haue atteyned to the places and offices of grettest auctorite in our cytee / And so called the veray noblesse & worship

Sothe it is / that the lykenesse of the faders / be for the more parte shewed in the childeren. by thordenaunce and establysshement of nature / And somtyme they be veryly lyke. that nothyng in beaute and personnages can be founde differente. And so that durynge the lyf of the sone / the fader may not be foryeten / Item many faders and childeren ben so lyke in maners / that theyr wyttes & maner of lyuyng be wel nyghe comformable / the childeren be so norysshed and brought vp in theyr faders houses / the whiche theyr famylyer custommes. and dayly conuersa∣cion of speche / and delynge to gydre. muste nedes drawe them to comformyte of maners / syth it draweth theym which be foreynes full ofte vnto the same / By the which reasons / it sheweth euydently / that custome and nature. haue ful grete force and strengthe in childeren / and in∣pressyng in theym ful hugely his force / So that for the more parte yf the fader and moder be vycious / they leue alwey a spotte vnto alle theyr progenye / And yf they be vertuous. they leue to theym a bryght fame. suche as withoute theyr demerytes. may not be taken from theym.
I coude remembre vnto you many yf ye wil not thynke me to longe / which haue had worshipful faders / & therfor without ony other cause / haue ben called forthwith noble who is that wel vnderstandeth the worship of Furius Cammillus / that wolde not Iuge his childeren noble & honourable / syth he delyuerd the cyte in most extreme pe∣ryll / out of the hondes of our enemyes / And so he allone repared and preserued the weal of our thynge publyque / who is he also in lyke wise / that wil not thynke the childe∣ren of Fabius Cato and Emilius worthy fame and noblesse / syth by the vertue of theyr said faders. the cyte was sette in so grete worship and surete / And they ther∣fore receyued so often theyr tryumphys / who is he that will not trowe / that our wele publyque / is gretely behol∣den to the childeren of theym / whiche so often put them self wilfully / theyr lyf / theyr goodes / and alle that they hadde in grettest Ieoparde and peryll for the same / ffor yf theyr faders wel and worshipfully acquyted theym self in that byhalue. And caused our cyte to floure in so grete worshipp and glorye / fforsothe me semeth / it were ouer vnkynde yf it wolde not haue theym in perpetual and worshipful remembraunce / And therfore in so moche as oure olders wold not ben holde but kynde. they ordeyned and establysshed by theyr statutes and lawes publyque / that who someuir they were. that chastysed theyr enemyes destressed grete folkes / or subdewed contrees to theyr obeys¦saunce / sholde receyue. at theyr retorne / that glorye. that was vnto an Emperour with worshipful Tryumphis openly yeuen. by the whiche they shold be exalted in
worship lyke vnto a gde Inmortall / Grauen ymages also representyng theyr lykenesse shold be sette in the places / where thassemblee of the people oftenest / & moost amply was had. Also theyr names to theyr perpetuel laude were wryten in the stone werkes enbowed / called the Arches tryumphal. tappere clerely to alle theyr heyres and successours. The whiche Arches tryumphal / Romay¦nes vysyted and worshipped certayn dayes of the yere by theym lymyted and ordeygned / wherfore it shold seme / yf suche and so grete worship was due vnto the grauen y∣mages / the same and gretter is due vnto theyr childeren and progenye. ffor tho grauen ymages were but a counterfeted representacion of theyr persones and victo∣ryes / And in theyr childeren nature hath lyeffully enpryn¦ted and shewed veryly the same / and / so ordeygned / that they maye doo grete & good seruyse / to the weal publyque where as the dede stones may ful lytil ease or prouffyte / And theyr childeren callyng vnto theyr mynde the no∣ble dedes of theyr progenytours. maye be so sette vnto the folowyng of theym / that they shold mowe doo many thynges ful weleful / and commodyous for oure estate publyque. And sette a syde many thynges noyesaunt & peryllous for the same / And therfor ful ofte / for the re∣ward of theyr faders merytes / our Cytezeyns haue youen to theym dyuerse offices of grete auctorite and worshippe Also more ouer / ther is no wise man / that vnderstandeth hym self nere his dayes and tyme of deth. gyueth charge so gretely of ony thynge erthely. as of that / that he shal mowe leue his childeren to lyue worshipfully aftir theyr
disceas / Ne in theyr age they can not vnderstande. ony thyng more plesaunt or ioyous vnto them. than yf there children by theyr vertues be called to estate and worshipp we see also that the chief of theyr thought. and pleasure is vpon theyr childeren / And some thynke they can not age ne wexe olde / whyle theyr childeren ben a lyue / ne that they be vnforsaken by humanyte. all the whyle / their childeren enioyen it / whiche premyses preue. that the loue of the faders / emong all the desires of mortal men / can not be thought to reste so gretely in ony one thynge. as in theyr childeren. & yf it so be that the pryncipal thought of the faders bothe fyrst and laste. resteth in the childeren. & in theym / and for theym they haue theyr plesaunce / and care / The sequele is vpon this cyte that they muste thyn∣ke chiefly / it be kept and holden to the childeren of theym I mene of tho faders / which haue so meryted thanke and laude. for that they haue doon for the same cyte / And furthirmore worshipe and make moche of theym / at the reuerence of theyr faders / and to vse and excercise that kyndenesse in theym. wherin they fawted in power to re∣compence the merytes to theyr said faders whyles they ly∣ued / Therfore me semeth / this is the hyest parte of nobles¦se. to come of theyr auncestres. of whom they may recoū∣te and reherce the noble dedes / many tymes worshipfully achieued and parfyghted truly & without colour / And for theyr benefaytes· theyr yssue may duely desyre. And by title of enherytaunce chalenge the offices of estate & worshippe in this cyte or ony other place / And remembre theym self. how they be veray partyes of tho bodyes which
haue ben so worshipful. eryng the lykenesse / ymage / and prynte aftir theym / Who is he that wolde not Iuge theym noble / namely whan alle men ben of the same op∣pynyon / Parde the comyne people. calle theym onely no∣ble. whiche ben descended of noble Auncestry. fferther∣more sothe it is· that the habundaunce of Rychesse em∣belyssheth gretely noblesse / by the whiche Rychesse. the seruauntes / and alle other conuenyentes. for the well beseeyng of the hows / ben had more goodly and play∣saunt / And suche thynges also as outward possessi∣ons / And foreyn causes ben better susteyned and ser∣ued. Frendship also and attendaunce of neyghbours / is by that meane purchased / And who is he that can thynke / that he sholde mowe wel helpe his frendes in tyme of theyr nede / whiche maye not of hym self releue his owne necessyte. Wherfor me semeth the chief and hyest parte of noblesse / muste reste in lyberalyte. And as I sayde he payneth hym self vaynely to excercise lybe∣ralyte to other folkes / whiche hath not wherof to vse it to hym self. It is necessarye thēne / that he that will be lyberall / haboūde in goodes of fortune. thenne his noblesse shal shewe / bryght by meane of lyberalyte / And the lusty brightnes of many noble persones is derked & seaced whan they lacke that / wherof they shold be lyberall· How many noble & chosen men haue there ben / that whan they haue be brought to the poynt of pouert / haue ben holden & taken for vyle / And of none estymacyon. how many hye & noble men haue deyed vnknowen for lacke of good / whos ver∣tue myght not conduyte theym to the fauoure of prynces
for that they lacked that. whiche was necessarye for sus∣tentacion of their lyuyng. Thenne habundaunce of good is a grete and asouerayn helpe / to the shewe / and settyng oute of the werkes of noblesse / by the whiche the courage may be enforced with grete hardynes. And the vertue of noblesse maye more clerely appere. And yf it so be that noblesse resteth in blood and rychesse / as it muste nedes. which of you is it faders conscript / that doubteth my blood And my hauoyrs / remembryd / but that I shold mow wel chalenge to be one of the moost noble of this cyte / ffor who is he that hath fought more manly. for our estate publy¦que / than myn Auncestres / Or where maye be founde e∣mong vs / that hath putt hym self in gretter Ieoparde for the same than they / Or by gretter force and vertue hath sette a syde fro this cyte peryll and disshonoure lykly to haue falle to the same / where can ye remembre that ony haue subdued to your obeyssaunce so moch of this world as myn auncestres haue doon / ffor one of theym whan he had chastysed the prowde courages of the kynges of Asie and dyuerse other nacions. deserued the name of Asie· to be ioyned to his name for a perpetuel memory of his victorye / Another of theym in the tyme whan ytalye la∣boured in the suffraunce of the cruell force of oure ene∣myes. whiche neyther spared to brenne / slee / and waste all the contrees enuyrōne / I meane aftir the grete bataylle of Gueius delyuerd the cyte all occupyed with wepyng / wayllyng. and woo. despeyred of releef. by the puys∣saūce of Hanybal thenne oure enemye / consydered with his dayly victoryes / enchaced the sayd Hanybal from
oure bondes of Italy / in to his owne contrey. where he put hym to perpetuel rebuke / And subdued the estately cyte of Cartage. which had alwey vs in hate / to our obessaū∣ce / by the whiche victorye / he meryted the name of Affry∣ca to be knytte with his name / And for so moche as the thryd Scipio in the tyme of the rebelles of Cartage. whan he had made the wallys & byldynges euen with the grounde / The said name of Affryca. he and his successo∣urs enioyed as a surname where in they were enheryted / I passe ouer to speke of other. by whos vertue and glorye this Cyte was soueraynly praysed and dradd. ffor yf I wold reherce you / the worshipful dedes and actes of eue∣rych of myn auncestres / I sholde peraduenture occupye you to longe / And I shold not vnderstonde my self / whan I shold make an ende. And I may moche more gladly and leeffully / in this byhalue put my self to sy∣lence. syth that theyr famous dedes be to theyr Infynyte lawde notayrely knowen of you alle / ffor where is the place in this Cyte that is voyde / of the tryumphal wry∣tyng of myn Auncestres / or where is that temple / that is not enourned with the ryche espoylle of their victory∣es / what sacred places can we see here / In which the pyctour or grauyng of theyr ymages is not / And they be suche / & as grete remēbraunces of theyr noblesse / as is leefful for ony mortal man to wyll or desyre / which premysses preue euydently / in how grete noblesse of blood I am enheryted / ffor I bere in me the veray ymage of theym / ffor who so e∣uer knewe theym / & now seeth me / maye not faill to calle theym vnto his mynde / I am he that represēted their blood
theyr membres / and theyr shappe in this body which I be∣re aboute / Of theym I cam / In theyr howses I was nou¦rysshed / and with theym I dwellyd tyl I atteyned the ye∣res of my force / And so I am descended of the strene of theyr noblesse / that in no wise it may be taken fro me / and yf this cyte be dettour vnto theym / ffor theyr benefaytes. I muste nedes clayme / as theyr heyr / parte of the same dette / And me semeth I may chalenge of you worshypful faders of right. suche offices of worship as shal falle in your yefte. ffor I trowe ther were neuir none more wor∣shipful endowed with noble courage than myne aunces∣tres / which vnto me lefte as grete plente of noblesse and rychesse / as can of ony persone be wylled or desyred / ffor my fader lefte vnto me fayre and stately places / wel and plenteuously fornysshed of alle maner thynges / whiche shold be longe vnto theym / so that whan they be arayed and honged with suche stuff as he left me / ther is ful ly∣til difference. bytwene the palayses of kynges / and my byldynges / I haue thenne withoute the subarbes. places of disporte as lustely and pleasauntly bylded· as can be deuysed / besyde that I haue in champayne· ffertyle feldes. ryche posseessions and fayr vyllages / whiche be able to receyue. not only a grete howshold. but a grete hoost / And furnysshe them haboundauntly of alle maner of vitayll / What howshold I kepe and how it is beseen· Alle the peple of this cyte knowe well ynough / fforsothe I haue so grete plente of the yef∣tys of fortune. And of my worshipfull progeny∣tours. that I dare saye / So that no man ther with
be displeased / that there be fewe in this cyte in byrthe and rychesse / whiche excelle me. Thenne lete Gayus Flammyneus put hym self to sylence / And namely in this stryf of noblesse / or in the desyre of fair Lucresse / syth in byrthe and rychesse he maye chalenge no parte of noblesse / Namely syth it is to vs alle vnknowen / from whens he cam. And whether he haue ony lytle pyece of er∣the to bylde vpon a Cote or lodge. And therfor of veray right I aske this fayr lady / whiche is to be maryed / that hath chosen me / syth I am more noble than Flammine∣us. And therfore I haue best deseruyd to be perpetual ser∣uaūt to her moost beautyuo{us} grace / duryng my lyf / And ye my lady Lucresse haue right grete cause to be right glad / and thanke our goddes hertely / which haue endowed you with so grete wisedom and grace. ffor ye cowde not haue chosen a more faythful. ne more obeyssaunt seruaūt ne one that loueth you more hertely. ne one with whome ye shold passe youre yeres more prosperously. ffor I shal brynge you to my lodgyng where ye shal see estately byl∣dynges of halle and chambres conuenient for a kynge. Next ye shall see the chambre of playsaunce wyth ryche and playsaunt beddes and hangynges. Also the ryche pyeces of clothes of gold and sylke for youre araye∣ment / And ye shal chese as moche as shal please you of theym / ye shal not be vexid with comyn labo∣urs / ye shal lede youre lyf with pleasaunt ydelnesse / And ye shall not nede to breke youre slepe to thyn∣ke how ye shal gete you moneye to lyue at youre ly∣berte. As it shal best please you. And ye shal not
nede to thynke on ony thynge / but how ye shal be mery in syngyng daūsynge / huntynge / hawkyng / and suche other disportes of pleasaunce / And ye shal haue suche gentil wymmen / to be parteners of your playsyrs as ye wil che∣se / and other maydens whiche shal be redy to obeye youre commaundementes / Ther shal no day passe you / that ye ne shal haue som disporte of pleasaunce. And I shal en∣force me to make you passe the nyghtes meryly / And Flammineus myght euyl promyse you thise thynges. syth he is of suche pouerte. that he lacketh alle thyse hym self. And with hym forsothe ye sholde lede ouer wretchid and careful lyf / ffor in stede of estately and playsaunt beddes and hangynges / ye shal fynde in his hows such as they vse vpon londe. / And in stede of playsaunt ydelnes ye shal fynde ouer peyneful besynesse. In stede of reste / laboure / And in stede of slepe. watche / And ther shold no daye passe you ferre / without laboure and occupacion / who is he· therfore that supposeth / but that fayr Lucresse wolde haue me to her seruaunt / whan she cheseth the more noble of vs tweyne / fforsothe Madame ye vnnethe speke more openly / In this your wysest / and moost discrete choys. onlesse that ye had named me by my name / ful womanly & couertly ye expressyd your desire / & where your shamefast womanhed wolde not saye / I desyre Cornely / ye sayde / I desire the more noble of theym tweyne / It were ouer grete a folye to deme otherwyse / ffor who is he that wolde byle∣ue / that ye wold forsake playsāt reste / & chese peynful besi¦nes / therfor ye faders cōscript acordyng vnto your estates & dygnytees / gyue ye a rightuo{us} sentence in this mater /
Thus endeth the Oracion of Cornelius Scipio And here foloweth the oracion of Gayus Flāmineus wOrshipful ffaders conscript / syth I am en∣forced to speke for my parte of noblenes / me semeth I haue a veray grete grace to haue you to my Iuges. whiche be moost noble / & endowed with moste assured courage / Ther can nowher be founde ony. which haue so parfyght vse of noblesse as ye And it is the thynge to my souerayn comforte and ioye / whan I remembre you so ful of equyte & right hauyng so parfyght knowlege of thynges with a customed vse of vertue. Thenne I shal not mowe suffre of you ony wron¦ge / or saye ony thynge not knowen to you / or remembre ony vertu / the whiche ye your self vse not / In this con∣trauersye fforsothe faders conscript / it is to gyue more sad and quyck audyence· than in ony other pryuate stry∣ues / ffor this is a Iugement that shal concerne onely two cyteseyns. or one perticuler persone. but it is a thyng that toucheth alle folke / & shal euer be had in remembraū∣ce. And shal be named thorugh alle the world. theterne lawe of the sacred Senate of Rome / Ye maye see this daye otherwise than it hath ben afore tyme seen / how alle the pepole of Rome ben present / And lye in awayte vpon youre Iugement. And ye maye beholde the syght and loke of youre Cytezeyns and foreynes cast and fyxed vpon you / And to theym it is not only
comfortable to vnderstande / whiche of vs tweyne shal ha∣ue fair Lucresse / but whiche of vs shold be Iuged for more noble / therfor I exhorte youre grete wisedom to ad∣uerte the weyght of this mater / ffor how be it / Iustice is to be tendred and kepte / in euery mater / yet it is mooste to be take heed of / and how to be vsed in hyghe and grete maters. And faders conscript. I beseche you to pardone me for your grete humanyte and noblesse / though I spe¦ke more sharply in this mater / than I haue ben a custo∣med afore this / to be myne owne herawde / ne to saye euyll of ony other persone withoute grete cause / syth I knowe well / the fyrst procedeth of an Inmoderate corage / & the se∣conde of an inpacient herte / natheles I am enforced to the fyrst that is to saye my self / syth I muste nedes defende myn owne nobles / & to the seconde / I am compellyd / by the surquydous boost and wantoun langage of Cornely / which hath spoken lately byfore you / lytil worship of me. temptyng his softnesse with his sharp wordes· And yet he gaf me by that / grete helpe & socoure in my cause / bothe to rebuke and to represse his lacke of shamefastnesse / ffa¦ders conscript ye haue vnderstanden the playsyr of noble Lucresse / touchyng the choys of vs tweyne. And how Cornelius hath be bolde to descryue noblesse / And set∣te it in blood and rychesse / And so to preue that he is more nobl̄e than I. & ferthermore tolde of the worshipful dedes of his auncestres / And how grete Rychesse and ha∣uoyrs his fadre had lefte to hym / Soth it is / that the sub∣staūce of his speche resteth in this / but he coude nothyng remembre of hym self. that he had doo ony thyng worthy
or dygne of rehersayll or remembraunce· And therfore he vttred nothyng of his owne lyf and maners / And for∣sothe I trowe / that noblesse resteth not in the glorye of an other man. or in the flyttyng goodes of fortune / but in a mannes owen vertu and glorye / ffor what is nobles∣se other than a certayn excellence in vertue and manhode whiche proueth one man worthy. to be preferred another. ffor semblably as man excelleth alle other beestys / and not for his force / but for his reason / so by the vertu that one man hath / whiche another hath not / he excellyth hym / ffor whan a man hath be excercised in the craftes of gret∣test noblesse / that is to saye / in Iustice / pyte / constaunce / Magnanymyte / Attemperaunce. and prudence deseruyng a fame of excellence in theym. And hath quyte hym wel to the goddes Inmortall. to his fader and moder. to his frendes / kynne and his contreye / And hath be nourysshed and brought vp in the doctryne of lectrure / thenne me se¦meth forsothe / he shold be called / and reputed more noble worshipful & more famo{us}· than another as Corneli hym self saide a lytil by fore. whan he spak of his owne ma∣ners / And on that other syde / he that is corrupt with cur∣sed craftes. And betaketh hym self to cruelnesse / rechele∣nesse / Cowardyse / dystemperaunce / and Iniustyce / and gyueth no force of Relygyon / ne of the good wille of his frendes or not to vse pyte to his fader and moder in tyme of theyr nede / fforsoth me semeth / he shold be Iuged of alle men a wretche / vnnoble / shameful. and worthy to be sette a syde fro alle good companye. It is not habon∣daunce of Rychesse. ne the noblenes of byrthe that may
gyue or take away noblesse fro ony persone. ffor the cou∣rage of man is the veray restyng place of noblesse / the whiche dame nature themperesse of alle thynges here by∣nethe / hath ordeyned and establysshed to haue chief preemy¦nence in the lyf of man. and hath enfude it euenly in alle men mortall / fro the fyrst day of theyr byrthe / And she neuir Ioined it to the enherytaunce of possessions / ffor she wyll be at her lyberte & fredam by thaduyse of vertue / to gyue it. to whom she lyketh beste / And lyke wise as a glasse or a myrrour wel made / sheweth the fygure sette by fore it / yf it be faire / fairer / & yf it be fowle / fowler / so the courage which is pure & free / is disposed to take noblesse or Innoblesse indiffrently. And ther shold no man accu∣se the largesse of nature in this moost best. and excellent gyfte of fredom. ffor she gyueth to euery man a lyke cou∣rage / and taketh none heede of theyr kynne powerer or ri∣cher / ffor ther is no man so nedy. so vyle / ne so lytil sette by / but whan he is brought in to this world. he is endo∣wed with as good courage / as the sone of an Emperour or kynge. and as apt to vertue and manhode / and perad∣uenture in this cause I shal not nede to gyue many ex∣amples. what shal I saye of them. that haue ben born of symple and lowe kynne / whiche haue growen to grete worship. Of whom ther cometh so grete plente to my myn¦de / that this daye is to short for me to reherce the lesse par∣te of theym. neuirtheles I shal reherce a fewe / begynnyng at Tullius Ostilius. whiche was born in a ful symple cotage· And had fader and moder so poure and wretchid that ful fewe ther were that knewe theyr names / And
the said Tullius was an herde and kept beestes. and gre∣we so in wisedom and vertue. that atte laste / he occupyed the grettest auctorite and dignyte in this cyte / And how he enlarged the same cyte. and subdewed the veyentys. & the fydenatys oure grettest ennemyes / And brought theym to oure obeyssaunce. It is open to you alle / Also Seruius Tullius born of a bonde stocke atteygned the highest gouernaunce of this cyte / And byhaued hym self so nobly therin / that he made the sabynes· youre sub∣gettes / and thryes he receyued his tryumphe / fferthermore he ioyned to this cyte thre hylles / Also Marcus porcius Cato was born in suche another Cote / a full lytil hows lyke as was Tullius hostilius. And he was in this cy∣te of so grete dygnyte and auctorite. that he passed alle other in his dayes. he was right noble and necessary to our comynte / he was in his tyme a worthy knyght / and a veray good clerke. & he was had in grete reuerence of the cytezeyns / that by his wisedom he encreaced the nombre of the Senatours / And embelysshed the mageste of the Senate with his presence / Euery man knoweth also how Marius was born in the wylde felde. for his fader & moder were so poure / & so abiect a stok / that they had no hows of theyr owne. & yet in right grete vertue & excellēt manhode he flowred / all ye knowe wel / how he was fyrst in the bataylle agaynst Iugurtha vndernethe his mays∣ter Methelius. which was that tyme questour of Rome whome the said Marius succeded in his office of Consul And he byhaued hym so wel in the said bataylle. that he put to flyght the said Iugurtha / And Bokkus kyng
of Maurytanus whiche cam that tyme with grete mul∣titude of people to socoure and enforce Iugurtha. And whan he had put hym to flyght / he wan many cas∣tellys and fortresses. And atte laste toke the said Iu∣gurtha / and brought hym afore his chare to rome / And there receyued his tryumphe. with right grete glorye. Aftir that whan the peple whiche were called Symbry∣anes had wonne the felde of the Romaynes. whiche ma∣de alle the cyte to tremble and quake for feere / in lyke wise as they dyde in tyme of Hanybal / Thenne Mari∣us was chosen to be the Capetayn of the felde made a∣gayn the sayd Symbryanes / where he had the victorye And delyuerd the cyte fro feere and peryll / And therfor he receyued his seconde tryumphe / Socrates also which was the veray myrrour of the wisedom of man / whos doc¦tryne hath enlumyned alle the scoles of philosophers / whiche was also the wysest and cunnyngest of all mor∣tal men / as grete Appollo bereth witnesse / He had to his Moder a mydwyf / And to his fader a Marbyler / Eurypydes also whiche excellyd in his tyme alle other / in wrytyng of Tragedyes / And Demostene the moost eloquente Oratour of the grekes were born of right pou∣re and symple stocke / And who is he that wolde or dar call theym vnnoble / It muste nedes be graunted that / eyther ther is no noblesse emong mortal men / ellys yf ther be ony it resteth in suche persones. as wysedom. force. manhode. forsyght / and veray vertue make theym to flowre aboue alle other / And gyue to theym fame lyke to goddes In∣mortall / And Cornely thou knowest wel thy self / how
vnlyke thou art vnto myn Auncestres. in euery thynge concernyng worship and excercises of manhode. whiche proueth wel the contrarye of that / whiche thou hast said. that noblesse is not knytte to blood. but to veray vertu. that is ioyned to the courage / ffor they tofore remembrid shold neuir ellys be callyd noble. whiche haue ben of sym∣ple and lowe byrthe / And many that haue comen of wor∣shipful auncestrys that deserued. by theyr demerytes / not only to lose theyr name of noblesse / but ouer that / to be callyd shameful and abhomynable creatures / And som I shal reherce of thy kynne / And first I wil begynne at the sone of Scipio Affrycan. whiche derked and defa∣ced the vygorous and vertuous fame of his fader / And that not a lytil with his cowardyse and folye / ffor whan he was destressed and take with grete shame by the kyng of Anchioche.

The said Scipio also / whan that he not by his merytes / but by the laboure of Cisero ▪ whiche was his faders scrybe had goten thoffyce named emonge vs Pretore. His frendes and kynnesmen were so glad therof / that they sayd / they herde nothyng of lon∣ge tyme byfore / wherof they were more heuy / And they vnderstandyng his cowardyse and foly. for fere leste he sholde haue blemysshed the worship publyque of this cyte / or the worthy fame of his Inmedyat progenytours▪ or∣deyned so emong them / that he was neuir suffred to sytte in his place annexed to his offyce / ne to gyue ony Iuge∣ment in ony cause / Also Publius of the same stocke
whan he was named Consull / And sente forth ageynst Iugurtha that had slayn Hatherbal and yempsal the sones of kyng Mysipha / whiche were euir frendely. and welewyllers / to the Romaynes / And therfore the said Publius was commaunded to take vengeance of theyr dedes / he ledde his hoost so rechelesly / that oure people were neuir more wretchidly and perylously conduyted. And atte laste he was corrupt with good whiche he receyued of Iugurtha / And therfor he made with hym an ouer sha∣meful peas. whiche was aftir refused. and vtterly despi∣sed of the Senate. And hym self therfore discharged of his offyce / to his grettest rebuke & shame. where may ony thyng more vnworshipful / I shold saye more shameful be tolde or reherced of ony man / And what shal I saye of the moost graceles yong man named Lucius Fabius Maximus sone of Allobrogus. his faders worship halpe hym not. whan he was knowen of so vicious and wretchid lyf / But Quintus Pompeus that tyme pre∣tor of this cyte. bannysshed hym perpetuelly out of rome What shal I saye ferthermore of the neuewe of Quin∣tus Ortencius / the whiche was a man in this Cyte of grete auctorite / And atte laste by euyl company was led∣de so / that he foorced not openly to goo to the stewes / and in syght of alle men. to haue a doo with comyn wymmen How supposest thy self Corneli. shold we deme theym that we haue reherced / noble / whan theyr lyf so moche wretchid and full of foly. quenchid the bryghtnesse of theyr noblesse / what yf they wold preche of the noble dedes and actes of theyr Auncestres / Or what yf they wold
shewe grauen or paynted ymages of theym / in tharchys tryumphal or sacred places. trowest thou thy self / whyle they were so vicious / that ony wiseman wold for all that they coude shewe / or remembre / eyther preyse theym or set by theym / Thenne it shold seme better for theyr owne plea∣syre & worship to kepe scilence / than to speke ony thynge of theyr progenytours / ffor there is no man / but he wolde thynke hem the more to blame. that whan they had so wor∣shipful an example sette byfore their eyen / they forsoke sha¦mefully and wretchedly to folowe it. & me semeth though theyr faders had don neuir so moche for the weal publy∣que of this Cyte. it shold in no wyse be dettours to theyr childeren. whiche ben of reuerse condicions / ffor lyke wise as theyr faders dyde embelysshe alle this cyte / So they spotten and defowlen the same. Theyr faders sette oure cyte in honoure and surete· And they euery day put it in peryll and nonsurete. Theyr faders by theyr vertue and force delyuerd oure cyte that whan it stode in grete Ieo∣bardye and perylle. And whan it was in grettest reste & peas / they haue sette it in grete trouble and disordynaūce And what shold such men mowe clayme by theyr meryte or deserte in our cyte / whan it had be good for the same ne∣uer to haue seen theym / & to their faders / neuir to haue bego¦ten theym / namely whan theyr said faders. preferred oure weal publyque theyr lyues / It is not thenne to doubte / that yf theyr faders were on lyue / and certaynly aduerti∣sed of theyr vyces / they wolde Iuge theym acordyng to theyr demerytes to grete turmentys / deth / or prepetuel exy∣le / ffor many lyke yong men of semblable maners. haue

The vertue of the fader maye vnnethe be seen / Therfore Cornely thou hast a ful veyne supposyng / whan thou trowest that the glorye and noblesse of the fa∣ders must be left to the childeren / as a thynge of enhery∣taunce / And alle this booste that thou makest of thy kynne. it sowneth moche rather to theyr lawde and wor∣ship than thyn / And though Childeren haue blood / and
alle thappertenaūtes perteynyng to the bodye of theyr fa∣ders / yet the veray noblesse / whiche resteth in the spiryte and courage / maye not be had withoute a mannes owen laboure and deserte / And where as thou sayst that lettred persones calle theym properly gentylmen whiche ben descended of noble kynne. fforsothe I holde wel with that / so they be lyke in suche vertues / as haue caused theyr forfaders to be callyd noble / And as for thy self / yf thou chalenge it by that title / Amende thy maners / or gyue ouer thy cause / But I trowe bet∣ter that persones wel lettred wil rather note them / which ben them self cowardes. and haue more manly for¦faders with degeneracion / than noblenesse / Syth that they be soo different in maners fro theyr kynne / It is dayly thyng of experyence. that may a worshipful man hath ful vnworshipful Childeren. And many a wy∣se man hath had fonnyssh Chylderen / And many a vertuous man. chylderen vicyous / And there thou leyest the vulgar oppynyon for thyn auctour. I holde it ful easy to dysaproue / syth it is so chaungeable and full of errours / And it is veray certayn / that the said oppynyon acordeth ful seeld with wisedome. But now late vs descende to that pouerte / that they whiche be noble or gentilmen haue diuerse tymes fallen in / where was ther oughwhere a pourer. than Marchus Agrip∣pa whiche was passyngly excellent / and necessary to oure thynge publyque / whiche was in that caas / that whan that euery man was taxed at a certayn / there
was nothynge founde of his patrymony / whiche myght relyeue or augmente oure comyn tresour / was not oure commonte fayn for as moche as Ualerina Publicola that had quyt hym so notably oft and many tymes for oure estate publyque / dyeng in suche pouerte / that he left not wher with he myght be enteered. but to burye hym on theyr owen coste and charge. And how the people of this cyte called Lucius Cyncinates fro the tilthe and sowyng of his londe to the hyest Empyre / It is easy to remembre / how the said Lucius proued hym self of suche vertue and courage / Thenne whan the Palesty∣nes had biseged this cyte / he brake not only the seage / And chaced theym to the flood named Alba. but ouer that / he wan and subdued echt grete cytees / whiche were the chief helpers and courageours of theym in theyr warres / And alle this victorye he achieued & parfyted in twenty dayes / And how glorious was the pouert of Ac∣tilius Seramus / whom whan the Senate had callyd from his plough to thoffyce of consul / he acquyted hym with so grete vigoure / that he destressed theyr enemyes & sette theym in surete. but yet that not withstondynge. the dygnyte of thoffice which bare the playsirs of this cyte / ne the rychesse or worship which he gate in our werres / coude not lette hym / but that he wolde retourne to his fyrst la∣bour / & theym which were so worshipful in marcial disci∣pline / & so vertuo{us} in lyuyng / shal we call vnnoble or wret¦chid / Is ther ony man so destitute of reason / that wil call theym / but most noble / which haue cōserued our weel publi¦que alwey in noblesse. me semeth this example suffycient
to proue / that noblesse may be ioyned with pouerte / And pouerte with noblesse / Ne lete no man trowe. but that a poure man. which hath worshipful maners and vertuous deades shold mowe wel be called noble and namely these whiche I haue reherced. that acquyted theym so manly and assuredly / for theyr estate publyque / frendes / and kynne / whan they had grettest nede of comforte & socoure / Were not thies folkes lyberall / and worthi to be pray∣sed in the hyghest degree of lyberalyte / whan they left alle theyr owen playsyr / and prouffytes / to doo theyr seruyse for the comyne weale / I trowe it was a gretter lyberalyte to gyue to theyr cyte the fredom. whiche was taken fro it / and delyuerd theyr kynnesmen and frendes from all pe∣ryll. wronge / and Ieobardye / than yf they had departed al theyr hole patrymonye to theyr te. kynnesmen / & fren¦des / And who so euir payneth hym / be it in thynges pub∣lyque or pryuate / to be called lyberall / so moche the more he is proued euery day more lyberal. whan he vseth his dyly∣gence and deuoyr to promote his cyte kynne / or frendes / Thenne Cornely the lyberalyte of a worshipful poure man / maye be right grete & suche / that pouerte maye not dispoylle the vertue of noblesse / Honest pouerte maye take away no parte of vertue. Was it not the fayrest gyfte and rychest lyberalyte of nature to gyue euery man power & abylyte to be vertuo{us} / And therfor she hath sette it. in the inwarde places of the spiryte / and not in the foolhardynesse of fortune / And there is no happe so hardy and so comberous / that maye take vetue from hym / whiche is wel wylled to kepe it / ne ther is no happe
so merueyllous or plesaunt / that may brynge worship to hym / that is a recheles man or a coward / fforsothe it is. yf fortune had soueraynte aboue vertue / within a whyle there shold be no vertue / or ony meryte of vertue / ffor the choyse of thynges to be worshipfully parfyted / shold moche rather reste in fortune / than in the disposicions of our fre wylles / And therfor Cornely seace of that oppynyon / That is to saye to trowe that vertue / lyberalyte. and no∣blesse / shold haue theyr fyrst / cours. or begynnyng in tha∣boundaunce of Rychesse. ffor thenne it shold folowe / that how worshipful a persone were / whan so euir he faylled ry∣chesse. his name of worship sholde seace / And the con∣trarye is trewe / ffor that / whiche is veray worship or no∣blesse / is neyther subgett to fortune or happe. And tho men whiche I haue reherced. afore theyr pouerte attended / shold neuir haue ascended so hyghe in honour / ne haue me∣ryted suche fame of worship as they dyde. And therfor ye faders conscript. yf worshipful progenytours haue had chylderen worshipful. And yf pour progenytours haue had worshipful childeren. And yf merueyllous and gre∣te vertue haue rested in suche as haue be right poure. The sequele is to youre wysedomes manyfeste. whiche is this / that noblesse resteth neyther in rychesse ne in blood / but in a free and a noble courage / whiche is neyther seruaunt to vyce ne vnclennesse / but is excercised in connyng and vertu. And he that is en∣dued with suche a courage / deserueth best to be called noble / worshipful / & excellent / therfore in this contrauercy of noblesse hauyng / bytwene me and my felowe / me
semeth he shold beste deserue the palme of victorye / that may proue hym self most vertuous & worshipful / ffaders conscript I haue leuer in that byhalue to haue one other to speke for me. than to speke my self / leest I speke ony thyng sownyng vnto my owne lawde / and be boosted with the vyce of boost / Neuirtheles it is to me inly ioyo{us} whan I beholde youre moost ryght wyse courages and moost benygne humanytees. ffor I wote wel / I shal mo∣we saye nothyng in praysyng of my self vntruly / but that ye wil vnderstande it wel ynough.

but whan it had knowleche of some thynge / that I kne∣we not a fore. And of the veray trouthe of thynges / I had plente of maisters and techers / and many lerners with me. And emonge the wisedome of so many / there myght no man be lefte an ydeotte / I was so vsed in my yongthe to the doctryne of vertue / that ther is left no pla∣ce in my courage of vicious desyres / ffor in good feyth vyces be to me as noyous / displesaunt. and greuous as they may be.

And what worship had he at Rome in the presence of oure holy fader the pope. And so in alle other places vnto his deth / At whiche
deth euery man that was there. myght lerne to dye and take his deth paciently / wherin I hope and doubte not / but that god receyued his soule in to his euirlastyng blysse ffor as I am enformed he ryght aduysedly ordeyned alle his thynges as well for his last will of wordly goodes as for his sowle helthe. & pacyently and holyly without grudchyng in charyte to fore that he departed out of this world / whiche is gladsom and Ioyous to here / Thenne I here recommende his sowle vnto youre prayers / and also that we at our departyng maye departe in suche wyse / that it maye please our lord god to receyue vs in to his euir∣lastyng blysse.
