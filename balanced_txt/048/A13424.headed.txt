William Conquerour. BY bloudy battels, Conquest, and by Fate, Faire Englands Crowne and Kingdom I surpris'd: I topsie-turuy turn'd the English State, And Lawes and Customes new and strange deuis'd. And where I vanquish't, there I tyranniz'd, In stead of peoples loue, inforcing feare: Extorting Tolls I daily exercis'd, And Tributes, greater then this Land could beare. Besides, (the Normans fame the more to reare) The English I forbad the English tongue, French Schooles of Grammer I ordayned here, And' gainst this Nation added wrong to wrong. At last my Crowne, Sword, Scepter, Conquest braue I left, I lost, scarce found an earthly Graue.

William Rufus. WHat my triumphant Father wan, I held, I pill'd and poll'd this Kingdom more then he. Great Tributes from my people I compeld: No place in Church, or Common-wealth was free, But alwayes those that would giue most to mee Obtain'd their purpose being wrong or right. The Clergy I enforced to agree To sell Church-plate and Challices out-right, Vntill at last (by the Almighties might) My Kingly power and force was forcelesse made, My glorious pomp that seem'd t'eclips mens sight, Did vanish by a glance, by chance, and fade: For hunting in New forrest (voyd of feare) A Subiect slew me, shooting at a Deere.

The power of Wales in fight I did confound, And Normandy my valour did subdue. Yet I vnmindfull whence these glories grew, My eldest Brother Robert did surprise, Detain'd him, and vsurp'd his Royall due, And most vnnat'rally pluckt out his eyes, Kings liue like Gods, but yet like men they dye, All must pay Natures due, and so did I.

K. Stephen. BY wrested Titles and vsurping claime, Through storms & tempests of tumultuous wars, The Crowne, (my fayrest marke and fouleft ayme) I won and wore, beleaguerd round with iars. The English, Scots, and Normans all prepares Their powers exposing to oppose my powers, Whilst this Land laden and or'ewhelm'd with cares Endures, whilst war, woe, want, and death deuoures, But as years, months, weeks, daies, decline by howers, Howers into minutes, minutes into nought: My painefull pomp decaid like fading flowers And vnto nought was my Ambition brought. Thus is the state of transitory things, There's nothing can be permanent with Kings.

They poysned my sweet beautious tainted Rose, By Isabels deuice my furious Queene: My very bowels 'gainst me did oppose: Such fruit hath lust, such force hath iealous spleene.

At last the Pope was pleas'd, and I reblest; Peace was obtain'd, proclaim'd I re-inthroan'd. Thus was my raigne with woes opprest and prest, Blest curst, friends, foes, diuided and atton'd.

Henry 3. IN toyle and trouble, midst contentious broyles, I seiz'd the Scepter of this famous Land: Then being greatly wasted with the spoyles Which Lewis had made with his French furious band But I with Peeres and people brauely mand, Repeld, repulst, expulst insulting foes. My Barons did my Soueraigntie withstand, And wrapt themselues and me in wars and woes: But in each battell none but I did lose, I lost my Subiects liues on euery side: (From Ciuill wars no better gayning growes) Friends, foes, my people, all, that fought or dyed.

Edward Long-shankes. MY Victories, my Valour, and my strength, My Actions, and my neuer-conquer'd name, Were spred throghout the world in bredth & length By mortall deeds, I wan immortall Fame. Rebellious Wales I finally did tame, And made them Vassalls to my Princely Son: Ientred Scotland fierce with Sword and Flame, And almost all that Kingdome ouerrun. Still where I fought, triumphantly I won, Through Blood and Death my Glory I obtain'd: But in the end when all my acts were done, A Sepulcher was all the gaine I gain'd. For though great Kings contend for earthly sway, Death binds them to the peace, and parts the fray.
EDWARD THE SECOND, KING OF ENGLAND, Lord of IRELAND, Duke of AQVITAINE, &c.

Edward 2. SOone after was my fathers Corps inter'd, Whilst Fate and Fortune did on me attend: And to the Royall Throne I was prefer'd, With Aue Casar euery knee did bend, But all these fickle ioyes, did fading end, Peirce Gaueston, to thee my loue combinde: My friendship to thee scarce left me a friend, But made my Queene, Peeres, People, all vnkind, I tortur'd, both in body and in mind Was vanquisht by the Scots at Bannocks Bourne: And I enforc't by flight some safety finde, Yet taken by my Wife at my returne, A Red-hot spit my Bowels through did gore, Such misery, no Slaue endured more.

Edward 3. IN Peace and War, my Stars auspitious stood, False Fortune stedfast held her wauering Wheele; I did reuenge my Fathers butche'rd blood, I forced France my furious force to feele: I Warr'd on Scotland with triumphing Steele, Afflicting them with slaughtcring Sword and Fire: That Kingdome then deuided needs mustreele, Betwixt the Bruces and the Balliols ire. Thus daily still my glory mounted higher, With blacke Prince Edward my victorious Son, Vnto the top of Honor wee aspire, By manly, Princely, worthy actions done. But all my Triumphs, fortunes, strength, and force, Age brought to death, and death turn'd to a Coarse.

Richard 2. A Sun-shine morne, precedes a showry day, A Calme at Sea oft times fore-runnes a Storme: All is not gold that soemes so glistring gay: Foule Vice is fairest features Canker-worme, So I that was of blood, descent and forme, The perfect image of a royall stock, Vnseason'd young a duice did me deforme, Split all my Hopes against Despaires black rock, My Regall name and power was made a mock, My Subiects madly in Rebellion rose, Mischiefe on mischiefe all in troopes did flock, Oppos'd, depos'd, expos'd, inclos'd in woes, With wauering fortunes, troublously I raign'd, Slaine by soule murther, peace and rest I gaind.
HENRY THE FOVRTH KING OF ENGLAND, And FRANCE: LORD OF IRELAND, &c.

Henry 4. FRom right (wrong-doing) Richard I did wrest His Crowne mis-guided, but on me mis-plac'd: Vnciuill Ciuill Wars my Realme molest, And English men did England spoyle and wast. The Sire the Son, the Son the Father chas'd, Vndutifull, vnkind, vnnaturall, Both Yorke and Lancaster were rais'd and rac'd, As Conquest did to either Faction fall. But still I grip'd the Scepter and the Ball, And what by wrong I won, by might I wore: For Prince of Wales I did my Son install, But as my Martiall Fame grew more and more, By fatall Fate my vitall threed was cut, And all my Greatnes in a Graue was put.
HENRY THE FIFT, KING OF ENGLAND, And FRANCE: LORD OF IRELAND, &c.

Henry 5. FRom my Lancastrian Sire succesiuely, I Englands glorious golden Garland got: I temperd Iustice with mild clemency, Much bloud I shed, yet bloud-shed loued not. Time my Sepulchre and my bones may rot, But I ime can neuer end my endlesse fame. O' liuion cannot my braue acts out blot, Or make Forgetfulnesse forget my name. I plaid all France at Tennise such a Game, With roaring Rackets, bandyed Bals and Foyles: And what I plaid for, still I won the same, Triumphantly transporting home the spoyles. But in the end grim Death my life affail'd, And as I liu'd I dy'd, belou'd, bewayl'd.
HENRY THE SIXT, KING OF ENGLAND, And FRANCE: LORD OF IRELAND, &c.

Henry 6. GReat Englands Mars (my Father) being dead, I, not of yeares, or yeare; but eight months old: The Diadem was plac't vpon my head, In royall Robes the Scepter I did hold: But as th'Almighties workes are manifold, Too high for mans conceit to comprehend: In his eternall Register enrold My Birth, my troublous Life and tragicke End. 'Gainst me the house of Yorke their force did bend, And Peeres and People weltred in their gore: My Crowne and Kingdome they from me did read, Which I, my Sire, and Grandsire kept and wore. Twice was I crown'd, vncrown'd, oft blest, oft crost, And lastly, murdred, life and kingdome lost.
EDWARD THE FOVRTH, KING OF ENGLAND, And FRANCE, LORD OF IRELAND, &c.

Edward 4. I Yorkes great heire (by fell domesticke Warre) Inthroned was, vn-King'd, and reinthroan'd: Subiecting quite the House of Lancaster, Whilst wofull England ouerburthen'd, groan'd: Old Sonlesse Sires and Childlesse Mothers moan'd: These bloody broyles had lasted threescore yeares, And till the time we were in peace attoan'd, It wasted fourescore of the Royall Peeres: But age and time all earthly things outweares, Through terrours, horrors, mischiefe and debate, By trust, by treason, by hopes, doubts and feares, I got, I kept, I left and lost the State. Thus as disposing heauens doe smile or frowne, So Cares or Comforts waite vpon a Crowne.
EDWARD THE FIFT, KING OF ENGLAND, And FRANCE, LORD OF IRELAND, &c.
Edward the 5 being 13 yeres of age came att london to be crouned the 4 of may 1483. Was deposed of his Croune by his onnaturall onkel the protecter, laste his lyff in the tower his buriall is onknowen.
Edward 5. IF birth, if beauty, innocence and youth, Could make a Tyrant feele one sparke of grace, My crooked Vncle had bene mou'd to ruth, Beholding of my pittie-pleading face. But what auailes to spring from royall Race? What surety is in beauty, strength, or wit? What is commaund, might, eminence and place, When treason lurkes where Maiesty doth sit? My haplesse selfe had true false proofe of it: Nipt in my bud and blasted in my bloome: Depriu'd of life by murther, most vnfit, And for three Kingdomes could not haue one Tomb. Thus Treason all my glory ouer-top't, And e're the Fruite could spring, the Tree was lop't

Richard the 3. king of England began his Raigne the 22. of June 1483. hee Raigned 2 Yeares 2. months hee was slaine at bosworth by Henrie earle of Richmond. And lyeth buried at lecester.
Richard 3. AMbition's like vnto a quenchlesse thirst. Ambition Angels threw from Heauen to Hell, Ambition (that infernall Hag) accurst, Ambitiously made me aspire, rebell: Ambition, that damned Necromanticke Spell, Made me clime proud, with shame to tumble downe. By bloudy murther I did all expell, Whose right, or might, debard me from the Crowne, My smiles, my gifts, my fauours, or my frowne, Were fain'd, corrupt, vile flattry, death and spight, By cruell Tyranny I gat renowne, Till Heau'ns iust Iudge me iustly did requite. By blood I won, by blood I lost the Throne: Detested liu'd; dy'd lou'd, bewail'd of none.
HENRY THE SEVENTH, KING OF ENGLAND, And FRANCE: LORD OF IRELAND, &c.

Henry 7. I Was the Man (by Gods high grace assign'd) That for this restlesse Kingdome purchas't Rest: I Yorke and Lancaster in one combinde, That sundred, had each other long opprest. My strength and pollicy th'Almighty blest With good successe, from first vnto the last: And high Iehouah turned to the best, A world of perils which my youth o're past. The white and red Rose I conioyned fast In sacred Marriages Coniugall band: I Traytorstam'd, and treason stood agast At mee; strong guarded by my Makers hand. In glory and magnificence I Raign'd, And fame, loue and a tombe was all I gainde.

Henry 8. TO both the Royall Houses I was Heyre; I made but one of long contending twaine: This Realme diuided drooping in despaire, I did rebinde in my auspicious Raigne. I banisht Romish Vsurpation vaine. In France I Bullen, Turwin, Turney wan: The Stile of Faiths Defender I did gaine. Sixe wiues I had, three An's, two Kates, one Iane. In my expences Royall, beyond measure, Striuing in Noble Actions to exceede; Accounting Honour as my greatest Treasure: Yet various fancies did my frailty feede, I made and marr'd, I did, and I vndid, Till all my Greatnesse in a Graue was hid.

Edward 6. I Seem'd in wisdome aged in my youth, A Princely patterne; I reform'd the time: With zeale and courage I maintain'd Gods truth, And Christian faith gainst Antichristian crime. My Father did begin; I, in my prime, Both Baal and Beliall from this Kingdome droue, With concords true harmonious heauenly chime I caus'd be said and sung Gods truth and loue. From vertue vnto vertue still I stroue, I liu'd beloued both of God and men: My soule vnto her Maker soar'd aboue, My earthly part returnd to earth agen. Thus Death, my faire proceedings did preuent, And Peeres and People did my losse lament.
MARY QVEENE OF ENGLAND, France and Freland, Defender of the FAITH, &c.

Queene Mary. NO sooner I possest the Royall Throne, But true Religion straight was dispossest: Bad Counsell caus'd Rome, Spaine, and I, as one, To persecute, to martyr, and molest All that the vnstain'd Truth of God profest: All such as dar'd oppugne the pow'rfull Pope, With grieuous Tortures were opprest and prest, With Axes, Fire, and Faggot, and the Rope. Scarce any Land beneath the heau'nly Cope, Afflicted was, as I caus'd this to bee: And when my fortunes were in highest hope, Death at the fiue yeares end arrested me. No Bale would serue, I could command no ayde, But I in prison in my Graue was laid.

Gods mingled seruice I did re-refine From Romish rubbish, and from humane drosse. I yearely made the pride of Spaine decline: France and all Belgin I sau'd from losse. I was Arts patterne, t'Armes I was a Patron; I liu'd and dy'd a Queene, a Maid, a Matron.
