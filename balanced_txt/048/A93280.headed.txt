Going naked, a Signe. OH Church of England, This is unto thee, who livest in oppression and cru∣elty, pride and covetousnesse, a day of misery is coming upon thee, thy nakednesse and shame is coming upon thee as an armed Man, from which no Man can hide thee, neither Hills nor Mountaines shall be able to hide thee in this the Day of the Lord, neither shall the Clefts of the Rocks preserve thee from the Day of the Lords Controversie with thee; Thy nakednesse and thy shame is neare to come upon thee, from it thou shalt not flye: Oppression and cruelty hath been as a Staff for thee, but the Lord is risen to break thy Staff of oppres∣sion, and thou shalt be left naked though thou hast seemed to be the glory of the Nations with thy deceitfull Covers, but now thou shalt be left naked, and Nations shall be ashamed of thee: Howle and weepe yee Teachers, for the Lord is gathering his people from you, and yee shall devour his flock no more: The Day is coming upon you that none shall buy your Wares any more ye Merchants of Babylon: All your scarlet colours the Lord our God is coming to take off: Then your nakednesse shall appeare to many Nations, and you shall sit as a Wid∣dow, and there shall be none to comfort you; Distresse and anguish shall take hold upon you, and pain as a Woman in travell, and is not able to bring forth, so shall your misery come upon you: The Decree of the Lord is gone out against all unrighteousnesse, he will surely reward every one according to their works, for as a Troop of Robbers lye in waite for a Man, so a company of Priests by consent lye in waite to murther the innocent Lambs of God, and for their sakes the Lord is risen in his mighty power to break the bonds of wickednesse, and to set the oppressed free, for the Lord hath heard the groaning of his seed, and he is risen to deliver to bring it out of Captivity, and from under the Taskmast∣ers, where his seed hath been long oppressed by unreasonable Men: But the Lord will spare no longer, but he will reward the Oppressors double into their bo∣somes, and his seed he will deliver. Oh howle and weepe your day is far spent, Night is coming upon you that you shall not have a Vision, and nothing shall be left to cover you: As naked shall you be spiritually, as my body hath been temporally naked in many places in England, as a signe to the nakednesse and shame that is coming upon the Church of England, who liveth in Oppression and cruelty, and all who lift up a weapon for her shall fall in the shame with her, which will surely come to passe; So all sober people consider your wayes, and turn to the light which comes from Jesus, that with it you may be gathered unto the Lord from the false Teachers to the teachings of the Lord, from the false worships to the worship of the Lord in spirit and in truth; For a necessity was laid upon me from the Lord God of life and power to be a signe: But before I was given up to the thing it was as death unto me, and I had rather if it had been the Lords will have dyed then gone on in this service; But when the word of the Lord came unto me saying, Goe on and prosper, It was sweet unto me, as the honey and the honey Comb. And blessed saith Christ are they that heares my word and keeps it. William Simpson. Printed for M. W.
