AN ACCOUNT Of the Manner of Taking the Lord Chancellor, With the LORD MAYOR'S SPEECH To the People upon that Occasion, December the 12th. 1688. THe late betrayers and underminers of the ancient Laws and Privile∣dges of their Country, being no longer able to carry on their De∣vilish Designs, and seeing Vengeance at their Heels, to the amaze∣ment of all the World, on a sudden fled away altogether, every one shifting for himself as well as he could, amongst which Number the late Lord Chancellor was the chief, whose Politicks and Law having at this time failed him, he thought fitter to trust to his Heels than to his Head, and accordingly on Monday the 10th. Instant, between Three and Four of the Clock in the Morning conveyed himself away, and having in Disguise got down safe to Wapping thought himself safe enough, having put himself on Board a Collier, which he pretended was Bound fow New-Castle, but indeed was Designed for Hambourough, but some Persons having Notice thereof, by the means of the Mate, they went to a certain Justice for a Warrant to Apprehend him, but he thought fit to put them off, whereupon they ap∣plied themselves immediately to the Lords of the Council, who granted them a Warrant, whereupon they went immediately to search the Ship, but he on Tuesday Night, thought not himself safe on Board the Collier, in which he was to pass, but lay in another Ship hard by; those that came this day to search for him miss'd of him on board, but had information given them that he was hard by, at a little Pedling Ale-House a taking his fare∣well-Pot, where accordingly they found him, being the Sign of the Red∣cow in Anchor and Hope-Alley near King Edward Stairs in Wapping, from whence they immediately hurry'd him in a Coach Guarded with several Blunderbusses to the Lord Mayors, where the Crowd was so great, and the Rabble so Numerous, all crying out together Vengeance, Justice, Justice; that the Lord Mayor was forced to come out into his Belcony, and with his Hat in his Hand desired the People to go away, and keep the Peace; and did promise them that he had already sent to the Lords of the Council about the Matter, and that they should have Justice done them; and that in the mean time, their Prisoner should be safely Guarded, whereupon the People withdrew, and soon after my Lord under a strong Guard, was sene to the Lords of the Council.
