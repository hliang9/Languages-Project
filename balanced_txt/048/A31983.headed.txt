royal blazon or coat of arms C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT HUNTINGTON 15o Martii, 1641. ❧ His Majesties Message to both Houses of Parliament, upon His removall to the City of York. HIs Majestie being now in His Remove to His City of York, where He intends to make His Residence for sometime, thinks fit to send this Massage to both Houses of Parliament. That He doth very earnestly desire, that they will use all possi∣ble industry in expediting the businesse of Ireland, in which they shall finde so cheerfull a concurrence by His Majestie, that no inconve∣nience shall happen to that Service by His absence, He having all that passion for the reducing of that Kingdom, which He hath ex∣pressed in His former Messages, and being unable by words to ma∣nifest more affection to it, then He hath indeavoured to do by those Messages (having likewise done all such Acts as He hath been mo∣ved unto by His Parliament) Therefore if the Misfortunes and Calamities of His poor Protestant Subjects there shall grow upon them (though His Majestie shall be deeply con∣cerned in, and sensible of their sufferings) He shall wash His hands before all the World, from the least imputation of slacknesse in that most necessary and pious Work. And that His Majestie may leave no way unattempted, which may beget a good un∣derstanding between Him and His Parliament, He thinks it necessary to Declare, That as He hath been so tender of the Priviledges of Parliament, that He hath been ready and forward to retract any Act of His own, which He hath been informed hath Trencht upon their Priviledges, so He expects an equall tendernesse in them of His Majesties known and unquestionable Priviledges (which are the Priviledges of the Kingdom) amongst which, He is assured it is a fundamentall One, That His Subjects cannot be Obliged to Obey any Act, Order, or Injunction to which His Majestie hath not given His consent: And therefore He thinks it necessary to publish, That He expects, and hereby requires Obe∣dience from all His loving Subjects, to the Laws established, and that they presume not up∣on any pretence of Order, or Ordinance (to which His Majestie is no Partie) concerning the Militia or any other thing, to do or execute what is not warranted by those Laws, His Ma∣jestie being resolved to keep the Laws himself, and to require obedience to them from all His Subjects. And His Majestie once more recommends to His Parliament the substance of His Mes∣sage of the 20th of Ianuary last, that they compose and digest, which all speed, such Acts, as they shall think fit, for the present and future establishment of their Priviledges; The free and quiet enjoying their Estates and Fortunes; The Liberties of their Persons; The Se∣curity of the true Religion now professed in the Church of England; The maintaining His Majesties Regall and just Authority, and setling His Revenue; His Majestie being most desirous to take all sitting and just wayes, which may beget a happy understanding between Him and His Parliament, in which He concerves His Greatest power and riches doth consist. ¶ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie: And by the Assignes of John Bill. 1641.
