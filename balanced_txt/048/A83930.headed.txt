Die Iovis 5o. Maii. 1642. LORDS HOUSE. WHereas the Lords in the upper House of Parliament, doe finde that there are many Petitions concerning private persons de∣pending now before their Lordships, and conceive that many more may be brought into that House, if timely advertisement be not given to the contrary, which may occasion the Repaire and Attendance of divers of his Majesties loving Subjects upon their Lordships, who cannot give a dispatch to pri∣vate businesses, by reason of the many publike and great Affaires that now lie before them, concerning the safety and weale of his Majesties Kingdoms: It is therefore thought fit, and so Ordered by the Lords in Parliament, That all private Petitions shall be hereby deferred and put off, untill the firstday of Michaelmas Terme being the 24th. of October next, and then their Lordships will proceed according to the order as they came in: Where∣of this House doth hereby give notice to all his Majesties loving people, to prevent the charge and trouble, which o∣therwise the Petitioners might be put unto in repairing unto this house at this time. Io. Browne Cler. Parliamentorum. LONDON, Printed by E. G. for John Wright. 1642. Cum Privilegio.
