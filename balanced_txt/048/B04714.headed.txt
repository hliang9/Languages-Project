Love in the Blossome: Or, Fancy in the Bud. Containing a Pretty, Pleasant and Delightful Courtship, betwixt two very Young (but truly Amorous) Lovers, being persons of very Eminent Quality, (at their first entrance into Cupids School.) To the tune of, Amarillis told her Swain. J. P. ONe Summer evening fresh and fair, Walking out to take the Ayre, Near to the Court, where Gallants sport, I carefully did wander, VVhereas in State, two Lovers sate Like Hero and Leander. It was under a pleasant shade, VVhere this prety Couple plaid They did not fear to be betray'd Nor had not yet espi'd me, To hear them prattle down I laid, And closely I did hide me. They were both of tender age, In loves affairs for to ingage, Yet Cupids craft, with feather'd shaft Had wounded them at distance, No humane art can cure the smart, In vain was their resistance. This young Gallantâ–ª stripling sate By his loving Lady-mate, And amorously began to prate He had both time and leisure, VVith kisses sweet, their lips did meet, VVherein they took great pleasure. She in Cloth of Gold did shine, And her Beauty seem'd divine, I often wisht she had been mine Fain would I be his Taster; But not one bit, that I could get, Twas meat fit for my Master. Having now both time and place Lovingly for to imbrace, This Gallants care, was to prepare The Art of Love to show her: Then near I stept and closely crept, And thus I heard him woe her. DEarest Love and Lady mine, Let our hearts in one combine, VVithin your brest, my soul doth rest Great Cupid hath betray'd me: To kill or cure, 'tis in your power Your Captive he hath made me. At your mercy now I lie, Grant me Love or else I die, By virtue of your eye; Dear heart in love I languish, Then be not coy my only joy But heal me of my anguish. Then she made this sweet reply A stranger unto Love am I, Good Sir forbear, let me not hear Of bondage at this season: The Ciprian Boy shall not destroy My freedome and my Reason. But if ever I should prove, Subject to the God of Love, Methinks my mind is so inclin'd Your Courtship is so moving, No one but you, whom I do know, Shall teach me th' art of loving, Then he was quick to speak again, Whilest his hopes afresh remain; He sometimes kist, and sometimes mist According as she strugled. But had they stai'd, i'me half afraid His oes he would have doubled. Now to break off their delight They saw coming in their sight Another pair, both fresh and fair Of spruce and amorous Lovers; And being met, they made no let But all their love discovers. Then they walked hand in hand, Subject all to loves command: I could not lye but up got I To see some further sport Sir, 'Twas almost dark, when ore the Park I see them pass toth' Court Sir. Then I wisht that I had there Such a pretty Lady near To court and kiss, to hit and miss, As others had been wooing; But all in vain I might complain, For I could not be doing.
