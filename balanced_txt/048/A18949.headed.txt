THE RAPE OF Proserpine. Translated out of CLAVDIAN in Latine, into English Verse: By LEONARD DIGGES, Gent. Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere fidus Interpres— HOR. de Art. Poet. printer's or publisher's device LONDON, Printed by G. P. for Edward Blount, and are to be sold, at his shop in Pauls Church-yard at the signe of the Beare. 1617.
To HIS MVCH HO∣NOVRED VERTVOVS SISTER, the Lady PALMER, wife to Sir ANTHO∣NY PALMER, Knight of the Bath: Her Brother L. D. wisheth increase of all true Felicitie, &c. MY deare Sister, the Dedication of this Poeme can belong to none more fitly, then to your selfe; since (next vnder God) your care of mee in a desperate sicknesse, made me liue to finish it. It is a Translation, and there∣fore farre short of the Originall, the rather because mine:) A Worke not so pleasing for Ladies (being in it selfe lofty, and harsh in the
translation.) It was intended to you, as a Patterne for a piece of Needle-work (I knew you were about;) for which purpose; I per∣swade my selfe, no Poeticall Authour will with more variety furnish you, then Claudian: howsoeuer hee or I faile▪ yet this first labour may seeme as an earnest-penny of my affecti∣on, and to tell you, that all true happinesse in this life, and eternall in the next, is wisht vnto you▪ By your Brother and friend, obliged euer to serue you, L. D.
To the READER. GEntle Reader, I present to thy view the three first books of Claudian{us}, de raptu Proserpinae in Eng∣lish Verse: a work (how pleasing it may proue, I know not) since of my Authour, Scaliger sayth, he was materia ignobiliore oppressus, but addidit de ingenio quantum defuit materiae, which wit, the Translators harshnesse of stile may (haply) haue diminished. The Reader will finde many faults; one I willingly here pre∣uent, which is, that Ceres is described in the first booke to be drawne by sixe Dragons, contrary to all Poets, that allow her but two: This and some few other errors I im∣pute vnto the hastinesse of the Presse, which the ingenious Reader will pardon, especially if the maine worke giue that light (that I hope for) to the Originall. Farewell. L. D.
THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE. The Historicall Sense or meaning of the Storie. WHen men for their finnes, like other crea∣tures, were forced to ordinary foode: the bread which they ate of (as Euse∣bius and Suidas mention) was of Acornes: and Plutarke writes, that after the Flood it was of the same. At that time, Siculus reigned King of Sicilie, whose wife (named Ceres) a woman of a singular apprehension (to trie a Conclusion) tooke some of the wilde Wheate, which groweth naturally so in that Country, and sowed seedes of the same, and was carefull to till them: these in their due time produced of that Graine in great abundance, which shee caused to bee moulded in∣to a paste, and (finding the sweetnesse of it) still sowed more and more, till she attained to the per∣fection
of Tillage; (with which shee instructed all her Islanders) so that the Sicilians were the first Husband-men in the world, and taught other Na∣tions, till such time as Wheate became the generall nourisher of all men. The commoditie the Sicilians reaped hereby, and the multitudes of such as applyed themselues to Tillage, were the causes of the diuisions of lands (touching which, Ceres made sundry lawes) some of which remaine euen at this day with vs: and for this cause the blinde Gentiles adored her as a goddesse, and consecrated that Island of Sicilie vnto her, as to the inuentresse of Har∣uest. It happened that this Ceres had a daughter, called Proserpina; who, for her exceeding beau∣tie was affected by Orion King of Epirus and the Molossians, and by him stolne away in the absence of her Mother Ceres: who when shee returned, and found that her daughter was thus gone (ignorant of the Rauisher) went ranging vp and downe the world to finde her, and in her progresse shee sowed all the Fields with Wheate as shee went, till such time as shee found Orion out.
This Story gaue matter to Poets, to faine, that Pluto stole away Proserpina from Sicilia, in her mothers absence (who missing her at her returne) sought her thorow the world, till she had found her with two blazing lights: and knowing that shee was in hell with Pluto, requested of Iupiter, that she might remaine with her one halfe of the yeere vpon Earth, and the other with her Husband Pluto. The Naturall Sense of the Storie. BY the person of Ceres is signified Tillage. By Proserpine, the seedes which are sowed, by Pluto, the earth that receiues them. By the diligence that Ceres vsed in search∣ing her daughter, is shewne the care that Hus∣band-men ought to haue in the tilling and sowing their grounds, and reaping of their Haruest. By the sixe Moneths that Proserpine remai∣ned in Hell, are vnderstood, the sixe, in which
the seede is vnder ground, before the eares ap∣peare; and by the other sixe that shee is with her Mother, is set downe, when the corne is ripe, and in possession of the Husbandman. By the blazing lights, with which Ceres seekes her daughter, is meant the vigilancie of the Husbandman in prouiding for the in∣crease of his haruest. By the lights themselues, are signified the instruments of Husbandry, without which the Corne could hardly be reaped. The Allegoricall Sense. BY Pluto and his suddaine resolution of mar∣rying and warring against gods, is noted, the nature and disposition of the insolent rich man, who blinded with ease and plenty, desireth immoderately all that his Concupiscence leades him vnto. By the Destinies that striue to diuert Pluto from his purpose, is seene the force of heauenly power aboue humane.
Mercurie's, being sent Ambassador to Iupiter, declares how necessarie it is that persons of a liue∣ly capacitie and mature iudgement, be sent to take vp strife and iarres betwixt Princes. By Iupiters decree to giue Proserpine for wife to Pluto, is shewne the Diuine Prouidence, that disposeth better of things for vs, then we our selues can wish. By Proserpine left alone in her mothers absence at her worke, is noted the good education of Chil∣dren, to which mothers are bound, that are honest and carefull. By Ceres leauing her alone, and Pluto's stealing her away, is put (as an example): That Mothers ought not to be so carelesse of their chil∣dren, as to expose them to so great a hazard of their honours. By Venus Executioneresse of Ioues will, and Diana and Pallas her Companions, is signified: that loue is a diuine connexion and bond, ordained from God, if the proceeding in the same bee with simplicity and purenesse of meaning.
THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE. The Argument of the First Booke Pluto e would may, threatens warre Gainst Iupiter, the Fates preuent their iarre: Swift Mercury Ambassador is sent To heaun, to tell the gods of this euent. Ioue, Ceres daughter doth resolue to giue His brother, and the meanes doth thus contriue; Whilst Ceres absent is in Phrygia, Venus must egge abroad Proserpina: Downe she descends the Virgin chaste to see, Diana, Pallas, beare her companie. MY loftie Muse is full, and bids me sing The robbery of Hell's infernall king, Grimme Pluto; and the Carre of Taenarus, That whilome with portentionsominous And giddie hurrie, through the blasted ayre, Presagd the Rape of Proserpine the fayre, Ioues daughter, and the marriges euent: Profaner eares be you from hence exempt.
And now the furie of a Spirit Diuine, Expell's all humane feare from this of mine: Apollo breathes in me, Phoebus inspires My braine, my quill with his most sacred fires. Now, now (me thinkes) I on a suddaine see, The Shrine of each immortall deitie, Shake in it's quiu'ring seate (vnus'd to moue) And the Coelestiall rayes (that from aboue Disperse their glim'ring light) forerunners are, Of Pluto's iourny and sad Ceres care. The noyse (that in the earth's deepe wombe doth sound) I heare, and Athens Temple so renown'd, For her King Cecraps painfully doth grone, (Doubling shrill Eccho's to the Cities mone:) And Ceres lou'd Eleusis tapers blaze With flaring lights which to the skies they raise: Triptolem's snakes their bloudie crests aloft Vpstretch, and with confused murmur soft, Glide their spot-painted bodies here and there, At which Spectators tremble, themselues feare: They hisse, and with strange accent to my Verse Hasten the Tragicke song that I rehearse. The three-folde Hecate appear's in sight, And lazy Bacchus (madding) doth affright The eyes of mortals with his shiu'ring lance Of wreathed Vines, and in a drunken dance (Loading his Temples with an Yuie crowne, Whose weight keepes his vnweldy body downe) Knits to his necke a Parthian Tyger's pawes, And skinne (that from his shoulder downe he drawes) You gods (on whom Auernus wandring soules, And multitudes of wights blacke Styx enroules)
Attend, and such as of their worldly crimes, In burning Phlegeton bewaile the times. You gods, you fathers, shew; declare to me The secrets of earths vaste concauity; Your gouernments reueale, and mysteries Of all those great and powerfull deities. Tell me, since Loue so lowe would neuer bend His shafts, what fire could Pluto thus incend? As snatching off from earth this Proserpine, He makes her his eternall Concubine: Yet comforts her (that in the Tyrants pow'r, Laments) by giuing Lethe for her dow'r. Tell me, did Ceres her grieu'd mother know Before, what should succeed? or if not so, When she was lost, in her distracted minde, Where could she hope her Proserpine to finde? That (longing for good newes) shee makes a vowe, The barren earth with fairest wheate to sowe. Long since, the dismall Prince of Erebus (Through wrath and fury growne outragious) To see that he (a god) and young, alone, Must leade a solitary life in mone, Wanting a mate, that dayes, moneths, yeeres retire And passe (regardlesse of his quenchlesse fire) Impatient of delaies and full of iarre, He summons all the supreme gods to warre; Disdaining they aboue should note his want, Of happy marriage to be ignorant. Redde lips, faire eyes, sweet lookes, soft cherishing Confus'd embraces, limbes proportioning, To their proportion all strange delight, Two soules combin'd in one, which make one white:
Like yuie (twining) yuorie necke, that one, One body, which one common breath alone, Giues life vnto: this one, and yet not one For (louers) each hath a Companion: So two, when as two bodies striuing moue In Cuptds lists (made one by mutuall loue.) These two, that one and all as motiues are, Egging sterne Pluto to ambitious warre: The name of father, and proud hope of sonnes, (Each) a fore-runner of new strife becomes: Forth-with the Monsters of infemall deepe, Ranke out their squadrons, and good order keepe. The vgly Fiends coniur'd by Plutos wroth, Gainst highest Iupiter take solemne oath; And menacing the gods in sad array Of battell, hels blacke banners they display Before heauens walls, and discord first appeares (Cladde all in ruth:) in armes of steele she beares The portraict of her name, and next to her Imperious Famine rageth, and base feare (Plac't as a Scout, or as a Runnagate, Against the foe to annoy them, cankred hate, Despairefull sorrow, rashnesse out of breath March last (led in the rere by conqu'ring death. Gainst thundring Ioue, the pallid Furies three Combine themselues, and bold Tisiphone That bout her head those curled Snakes doth twine With spinie fist, that of combustions pine A fire-brand brandisheth, whose boading light Compassion moues, and megar lookes affright Of her, the sad beholder: 'gins to sound Through all the Campe, and mongst the hel-hounds round,
A soft retreat (at whose well-knowne voyce) The pale fac't Monsters couch, and hush their noyse. The Elements, whose equall qualities For many an Age in peace could simpathize, Scarce now containe, but into discord turne, And faine to their olde Chaos would returne: Proud Titans off-spring hope at length to see Their gyues knockt off, and former libertie: That (breaking vp hels dung'ons) once againe, Punish they may the Author of their shame. Pluto, Aegaeons fancie now can please, That long hath layne cubb'd vp in little ease, And losing straight the Gyants hundred hands, (Arm'd to obey the threatning Gods commands) He musters vp his seu'nteene brothers more Vnto a second Combate (for before They plotted had gainst heau'n) and now they long Ioues thunder to retort the gods among. VVhen soone the reu'rend Destinies that see Sterne warres approach, and hels infantery Range into battaile, with stout puissance, And fearefull march 'gainst heauens gates aduance: So many horrid fiends that likely were To put the gods, and all Ioues hoast in feare: And (doubting lest the terror of this fight, The Orbes Celestiall endanger might) Eu'n in the heate and danger of the rowt They gently tread, and pace the Campe throughout; And prouidently thus themselues intrude With modest threats, to tame the multitude: Then prostrate 'fore the valiant General, With bended knees and humble lookes they fall;
(Spreading their aged Cheekes and frontes seuere, With dangling tresses of their snowie haire.) Their hands they ioyne, those hands that spun the thred Of many liuing, many thousans dead; Those hands they ioyne, to whose high soueraign'ty, The World, and all things breathing Vassals be: First, Lachesis, the eldest of the three, And most austere, diuides in modestie The hoary threds, which (for she nastie keepes) Vncomb'd, they thwart and hide her wrinkled cheekes: In her owne name, and sisters both, she greets Blacke Pluto, and to mitigate his threats 'Gainst Ioue, first weepes: then wiping her sad eyes, With fainting voice she to him gently cries, And thus begins. Thou mighty king (saith she) Great Ruler of our vaste obscuritie, Thou (to whose sacred iudgement) the least wight That groanes in darkenesse, and hels horrid night Is subiect; thou, whom loyall Fates haue seru'd So long and from thy precepts neuer sweru'd, With web and spindle; thou that first giu'st breath To all things liuing, thou, whom life and death, Equally waite on; thou, to whom the sage Fleet time, what ruines he in euery age Collects, doth giue; and vnto thee the state Of present things doth likewise consecrate: And lastly thou, by whom, the Soules condemn'd Haue second being, torture without end. Seeke not (great Prince) to haue thine honor stain'd (By breach of sacred lawes wee first ordain'd:) Cause thy robustious troopes retire, and cease T'incense them further 'gainst high heauens peace
Desist from hostile armes (impietie) Of making brother gods thine enemy; But if thou needs wilt venter, be no more A pow'r Diuine, but some wilde sauage Bore: Must Gyant race enioy a second light, And once againe outbraue in Martiall fight Th'vnconquer'd gods? Fye Pluto: do not thus Attempt a Warre so sacrilegious, And headlong cast thy Maiestie, forbeare; (If Marri'ge be the cause; or if thou feare Lest Ioue deny thee issue) mildly proue Great Iupiter: first let him heare thy loue. Pluto heares Lachesis: and though his rage Were such, as her faire speech could scarce asswage; Yet when the loftie loue strooke god, might see, The Sisters both to her soft prayers agree; The bloud that riseth in each blacke swolne vaine, He tempereth: the Furies straight proclaime His alter'd purpose, cu'ry Fiend that droopes To see this change, they lash, and force hels troopes Retire, thus was this fatall enterprise, Dismist, and Pluto calm'd by Destinies. So blust'ring Boreas (when with roaring gust, And whirle-winde arm'd) he first doth lay the dust, Then with a suddaine and tempestuous blast, (Enrag'd) he faine vpon earth's face would cast; Thicke stormes of hayle eu'n at the instant, when With full swolne cheekes he breakes his loathed denne, And (scowring the vaste Seas) would cause their flouds Arise (to drowne the fields and neighb'ring woods:) Eu'n then the milder Aeolus restraines His force, and keepes him fetter'd in strong chaines.
Pluto commands that subtill Mercury Ioue's sonne (being summon'd to appeare from high) Approach his presence, and from thence be sent To tell the gods his Vncles discontent: The winged messenger without delay (Swifter then thought) through the dull ayre makes way, And with his colour'd hat, and charming rod Forth-with appeares before th'infernall god; Who, in the darkest Vault of all, sate (plac't Vpon a blacke rude throne:) so meanly grac't VVith scepter course; only his visage stout, The horrour of his Maiestie set out: Ouer his head hangs vp a dismall Cloud, Which serues for cloth of state, and now aloud 'Twixt rage and griefe he groans, and faine would speak, When, at first accent of his words (that breake Through hearers eares) at their first hideous sound, The royall palace and moyst chambers round All shake againe; and at the fearefull note The triple Porter stops his howling throat: The three sad riuers at th'vnusuall voyce Affrighted stand, and stop their murm'ring noise, All hell was silent; but their king exceeds, And to his yelling Embassie proceeds. Ioues high-borne brood, Cylenian Mercurie: Olde Atlas Nephew, common deity To heauen and hell: thou, that hast passage free Through both the Poles, and equall liberty; Thou, that of all the gods both high and low, The mysteries and strict comerce dost know: Fly hence, with speedy wing cut through the winde, To thy vngratefull Sirethus speake our minde,
What right hast thou, or what prioritie, (Cruel'st of all thy brothers) ouer me? Say, Fortune blind with an vnequall hand, (To me denying) gaue thee heau'ns command? Yet are these temples honour'd with a crowne, As well as thine, nor can thy pride beate downe Our glory; though we want the light, thou shalt Perceiue our strength, when I thy walls assault: Think'st thou the Cyclop's handy-worke I feare; Or those vaine claps that mocke the yeelding ayre? Cast downe thy darts of thunder, let them strike Affrighted mortals, we are farte vnlike To such; Know, Iupiter, I keepe my vowe, And to reuenge my griefes, am sure (though slowe) VVas't not enough? I then repined not At Fates, that first to my accursed lot Gaue this third kingdome, and depriued quite, (Though satisfied) I neuer sought for light: Nor wisht bright Phoebus might descend so farre As my sad palace, or the morning starre Lighten these vaults; when vnto thee the seau'n, (That make Charles-wayne twinkle in spangled heau'n) And millions more thy glorious state adorne: Poore I, that all in darknesse sit forlorne (Discomfortably mournfull) no glad sight Enioy, but waste in a perpetuall night, VVhere are no comforts to the eye or eare, Nothing but noyse, and notes of ghastly feare, For what harmonious musicke hath hells king? Where ghosts keep howling time, whil'st scriech-owles sing: Yet thou that see'st me bare of all reliefe, (The more to aggrauate my sullen griefe)
Forbidd'st me Nuptiall rites; thus Ioue repines At Pluto's wishes, when his Concubines Are numberlesse; the Sea-god happier is, (Though lesse in power then I) and hath more blisse, That when the raging billowes he allayes, Faire Amphitrite with her Neptune playes And he (intangled in her soft embrace) Forgets the vse of his three-forked mace. When thou in midst of Tytans scorching heate, With labour of thy thunder-claps dost sweate To coole the partch't earth, with moist drops of raine, And (weary of thy toyle turn'st backe againe) Incestuous Iuno sits in longing state VVith open lap her Lord to recreate: Latona, Ceres, Themis: (each of which Sufficient were) but all of these, enrich Thee, with the name of father, and thy seate Keepe still with hopefull successors repleace: Thus thou, in lustfull ryot (varying) Liu'st at thine ease, whil'st I (thy brother king) In darkest dungeon (like a slane) am voyde Of those delights, with which thou most art cloid: And thus my prime of youth doth fade, and pride Of issue, failes; (by wanting alov'd Bride) But come reuenge, awake dull patience, (Suffice long pardon for so iust offence) By all the shades of night, by all the Ghosts That houer o're blacke Styx, by all the hosts Of dreadfull horror, mischiefe vengeance dire, If Iupiter denie this last desire; The walls of Tartarus shall open wide (Thorough whose breach) the soules that there abide
(Condemn'd to endlesse ruth) shall sally out, And hast thy downfall with confused rowt: (Mongst whom) old Saturne once againe shall free The golden age from her captiuitie. (This sayd) the Tyrant ceast, and to his ire Gaue respit. Mercury (like nimble fire) Meane while ascends vp to the highest Spheare, And tells his message to great Iupiter. The god, vnto this vnexpected newes Gaue strict attention, and forth-with' gins muse In his diuine brest, what would be th' euent Of such a marri'ge, who would be content (Of all the goddesses) to lose the light In lieu she may be queene of lasting night, And (like a Iudge reuoluing many a doubt, At length resolu'd) his sentence thus breakes out, One only child the goddesse Ceres had One daughter, which doth make her mother glad: For though Lucina blest her with no more, Yet is she happy in this first she bore. This serues for many, and the want supplies, That second birth her barren wombe denies. This (as her dearest darling and delight) She often hugges, still tends, and from her sight She neuer let's her part; so Heifer young Or first yeeres Calfe, (that other beasts among Scarce presseth the soft grasse with wanton tread, Nor horned Moones, yet peepe from curled head:) The lowing Damme (that it by chance doth misse) (Finding) doth giue it many a licking kisse. The Virgin faire was growne now ripe and neare To Hymens rites, a chaste and shamefast feare
Breeds in her brest new flames: now she desires (One while) to marrie; then againe loues fires Despitefully she quencheth; thus, her mind Eu'n in a moment, makes her curst and kinde; To loue, and not to like; which mysterie Is caus'd by feare, that beares the mastery Ouer her will (her will that oft doth call Her passions vp) but feare straight layes them all: Now store of suters throng and each 'gins ply Old Ceres, for her daughter (cunningly) Two great Competitors, with equall strife Contend, to haue the louely Mayd to wife: Mars with his shield, Apollo with his bowe And shafts, their greatnesses alike both shewe. Both offer a round earnest for their loues; Yet neithers suite the yellow Ceres moues: Nor though proud Iuno and Latona too Speake for their sonnes and (seuerally woo) VVould she consent: but (as a mother kind In her owne thoughts) and with fond passion blind: (Vnwitting future rape) her too too deare, She sought to hide from those she least might feare. And thus (descending from Olympus high, With her faire Proserpine) both secretly At fruitfull Scicile arriue; and there, The carefull mother in a iealous feare, Viewes the rich Island, and the Sea that round Doth ring-like compasse, and its fertile ground, Sprinkle; th'vnknowing goddesse straight conceiues The place for purpose fitting, and so leaues Her daughter to it's charge: thus neither she, Nor it, soresawe th'ensuiug prodigie.
Sicilia once the Continent did touch, And made a part of Italy, till, such Was the Seas rage, and Nereus swelling pride, As did the firme land seuer and diuide: He with his subtill art, and puissance stout The confines broke, and cut those mountaines out, Which, to the little land did there remaine, Contiguous were; now (parted from the maine) He bathes them with his waues, yet men may see 'Twixt both the Lands a knowne affinitie. The Promontories that are seene from farre, Pachinus high, and Lilibeum are On which the waues that (brauing play) let flee Their force, and make continuall batterie: Pachinus shewes vnto th' Ionian Sea His lofty head; the top of Lylibe Lookes to the Libian Coast, from whence (in vaine) The waues driues through his armes, which (as a reine And bridle serue t'abate and curbe their pride And roaring noyse;) when Thetis to abide Disdaineth there, and from the Thuscane shore, Her waues vpon Pelorus beate much more. These Promontories three, at first the Ile (Sicilia now) Trinacria did stile: In midst of which Aetna of old renowne (For burning rockes) so high his flaming crowne Lifts; that the Promontories (which before Did Gyants seeme) like Dwarfes his height adore: Aetna, true witnesse of Briareus His folly, and of bold Enceladus The Tombe and bonefire; where, he liues in death, And spits forth fire with brimstone-pois'ning breath:
The Mountaines load, there, keeps him prisoner fast, That when the weighty burden off to cast He (groaning) striues, and to his vtmost straines To quit his rebell necke from yoke and paines: The poore Inhabitants he maketh feare (By often shaking) lest some Earth-quake there Should roote the Islands vp, and so, her towrs, And walles, the violence of Seas deuours: This Mountaines top, is only to the eye Of mortals subiect; so you may descrie The smoke and flames, but neuer hath it yet Been trampled on by any humane feet: With stately Groues and Trees, the lower part Is deckt, that ne're were planted there by Art; The vpper, commonly with misty fogge Staines the Sun-beams, and dayes cleere light doth clog With pitchy Clouds, which (lasting vntill night) Ascend the Firmament, and dayes cleere light Conuert to darknesse; still the flames increase Is nourisht (though the mountaines selfe decrease.) In midst of boiling heate, the snow doth fall Vpon the top, and neuer melts at all: It snowes vpon the Mountaine, and that heate Which burneth there (albeit ne're so great) The snow it ne're offends, whose inward cold Condenseth it, and if dissolue some should, (By reason of hot vapors that arise) Yet most vpon the top congealed is, Or neuer lower falls: but that which breeds The greatest admiration, and exceeds All common wonder, is the noyse within The hollow Cliftes, that doth neuer linne
It's raging, whether caused by the wind, That stopt in Aetnas bowels faine would find A passage out, and cannot, till it breake With speedy motion through some open creake Of the torne rockes, till when, it rumbles there; Or else the greedy Sea, whose armes doe teare The Mountaines bosome, and the brackish waues Mingling with fires in those hot sulf'rous caues Within, and wanting meanes to sally thence, Adde matter to the broiling violence And noyse; vncertaine whether of the twaine It is, but one may be the reason plaine. Diuinest Ceres now most confident Of the sure Island (to whose charge she lent And left her dearest pledge) without all feare Or least suspicion of her danger neere, To Phrigia posteth, and amaine doth hie To her torne foundresse mother Cybele. By sixe fierce Dragons, that (taile wheeling round With writhed limbes) her chariot lift from ground, She carri'd is, and snatcht into the ayre, From whence her speedy flight (they swift) prepare, And, breaking through the clouds, that giue them way, Them leaue behind; and (posting) lead away With giddy gallop, the free raines they beare Vpon their lofty crests (bemoistned were With foamie froth) which on their golden scales They cast, and doubly spot their winged sailes: One while the middle Region they diuide, And soare aloft; then suddainly they slide Downe to the earth, and slacking of their flight, The Chariots golden wheeles they couer (white)
With hoarie dust: their Mistris (as she goes) Her bountie casts, and plenteously bestowes O're all the fields: the very tract and path (Made by her wheeles) sufficient plentie hath Of rip'ned eares; which (as she passeth on) Cloath all the fields and wayes they run vpon VVith golden habit. Thus behind her quite Aetna she leaues, and th'Island out of sight, Till (looking backe with her presaging eies, And moist'ned cheekes) the palace she espies VVhere she her daughter left; then with fresh teares She doubles her prognosticating feares (As doubtfull of the fatall accident) And thus the hard mishap would faine preuent (By courting the faire Island) Dearest Earth, Blest Soyle (saith she) farwell: my first, last birth, I leaue vnto thy charge; looke well to her, Be thou her guardian safe, since I preferre Thee before other places: as thy care Shall speed, the mindfull Ceres will not spare For thy reward: be sure of this before, The cruell Spade shall neuer wound thee more; Nor rugged Clowne (when he thy fields will sowe) Shall once, with crooked tooth of deluing plow, Teare vp thy fruitfull entrailes; thou shalt make Glad husbandmen to wonder, and forsake The vse of toyling Oxen, and sharpe Goad, VVhen (of their owne accord) thy fields shall load Their Barnes; and (for thy seasonable fruit) Their store-house, neighb'ring lands shall thee salute. This said, her Dragons haste, and she arriues Vpon Mount Ida, where Cybete liues:
Her Temple, there, with marble statue stands, (That worshipt is by many vprear'd hands, Couer'd with thickest boughes of blazing Pine) That seldome subiect is to stormes or winde: The furious Ayre doth seldome lash, or beate This consecrated Tree to goddesse great; But (gently whistling 'mongst the leaues) it beares And formes soft musicke to the hearers eares: VVithin the Temple, nought but dancing is To Bacchus, and confused melodies Of men, that (with their howling consorts round Of squeaking Pipes and rusticke Tabors sound) Shake Idas top; the holy shrines within The Temple groane (mou'd with the noyse and dinne:) At sight of Ceres all growes husht and still, The balling Quire, the Drumme and Trumpets shrill Desist; the Corybantes cease to waue Their glitt'ring blades, the Lions fierce and braue Are tamed, and their gentlenesse is such, As they their shaggy maines to euery touch Submit; the longing Ceres enters in, And by the mother of the gods within She welcom'd is, that at first entring place Bowes downe her Towr's to do the goddesse grace. Ioue from his supreme throne of maiestie This passage viewes, and his most strict decree To Venus lou'd reueales, to thee, I will, (Saith he) ô Cytherea shew my will And heauenly pleasure: know, I am resolu'd That my firme purpose long agoe reuolu'd In hidden thoughts, doe now it selfe declare, Be now fulfill'd, that Ceres daughter faire
Be giuen to hels blacke king; for Destinies Do so command, and Themis prophecies Haue thus foretold: the time inuites to this, Her carelesse mother farre off wandring is; Goe then, and to Sicilia take thy flight, That (when bright Sol, the mournfull robe of night Displayes, and clads the fields in gorgeous ray) Entice thou maist the mayd, to sport and play In Floras walkes; that (when thy skill is tri'd, Pluto may seyze vpon his louely Bride: Vnfitting 'twere (since all the gods, and me Thou burn'st) the lowerkingdomes should be free. No, no; let fell Erynnis feele thy flame, And Acheron acknowledge the great name Of Venus; she gaue eare, and (hauing heard Her fathers mind) to iourney straight prepar'd: Pallas and she (that with the horne-bent bowe, Arcadian Maenalus affrights) both goe (Together) with their sister, for so Ioue Commanded had; they out of filiall loue Their Sire obey, and (taking solemne leaue Of all the gods) them of their sight bereaue. Looke how a Comet (seldome seene) appeares To vulgar eyes, and fils men with strange feares: When (streaming o're the world with bloudy light) It boades vnto the peoples gazing sight Some rare euent: (as death of Monarke great, Or rage of sicknes sprung from Dog-dayes heate:) That, to the trembling Mariner (at hand) Threatens huge stormes, plagues, famine to the land; So shew'd the ayry tracke this troope diuine Had made (amazing with it's glorious shine.)
At length, they Ceres palace had espy'd And glorious lust're of it's top descride, And pinacles; that (as they neerer drew) The goodly frame they might at leisure view: (A wondrous worke) erected first of all By the blacke lab'ring Cyclop's; the high wall Of hard and strongest Thracian Ir'n was made, The massy posts that sustain'd and stai'd The weightie building vp, of steele: and wrought The rest was, with the Metall thither brought By those industrious Chalybes; who found The first vse of it vnderneath the ground. Neuer was great Pyracmon busied more, Or toyling Sterops sweate so much before, As ('bout this curious worke:) neuer (till then) So (puffing, breathlesse) Vulcans iourny-men Knocke on their batter'd Anuiles sparkling steele, (Held by the crooked biting tongs) that feele Their hammers loade: neuer was huger flame Rais'd from the weary Fornace, then that same Which, from the softned masse of metall thence Arose; nor bellowes, with more violence Breath'd on the burning Forge. Behold you might From far, the gates (shining with yu'ry) white, The top and battlements that outwardly Appear'd, with siluer and blacke Ebonie Checkr'd; the sollid beames the roofe vphold VVithin, of brasse; and pillars of pure gold? Here louely Proserpine, with melting tone, Sat, to her dying honour (all alone) VVarbling a swan-like farewell: for, she meant VVith worke in hand, and needle, to present
Vnto her Mother (whom she longs to see And still expects) her painefull industrie Drawne out in curious sampler; and so thought, (In vaine) to frame a robe of it (being wrought:) There she her fathers kingdome first began In liuely colours to paint out; and than Foure Elements (each in their order plac't) With cunning hand she flourisht, and so grac't The patterne with her skill, you could not know Whether the fire were burning there or no: Somewhat beneath (in region cleere and faire) She figur'd had the fresh and liuely aire, And next, the water, where she often makes A period to her handy-worke; and takes Fresh silke to thred her needle, for she here Had much adoe to make the Sea appeare In all his formes; the waues she to the life Describes, and set out their tumultuous strife: The waters were with purple wrought, the shore With Emeralds and Pearles all shadow'd o're; Behold you might the sedge and greenish weed Flote from the Rockes (as if they there did breed Where she had plac't them) with such Art conceiu'd, That warie Pilots well might be deceiu'd In viewing them; then forth a different skeine Of silke she sorts, and fresh to worke againe Begins, those sands, the brackish waters drinke: Those sands, so like; that lookers on would thinke They heard the Seas hoarse murmure: last of all, To th' earth she comes, yet (for th' originall Was but a dull piece, and grosse element) Lesse labour in describing that she spent:
Only some greene and yellow would bestow Vpon the fields and flowr's that in them grow: And (for vartety) amongst the rest, That of Narcissus story she exprest; Where (opposite) the new transformed Rose, The thorne-prick't goddesse loue to Adon showes. (These Elements thus finisht to her mind) Fiue diff'rent Zones, each in a seu'rall kinde And quality she notes, a crimson thred The middle woue (flaming all fiery redde Inhabitable) on both sides of that She plac't the other two, more temperate: The two most cold (as needlesse to be drawne) She prettily thus figur'd in the Lawne Wherein she work't; (a space there left) and so The Samplers white alone exprest their snow. Next to her Vncles palace she descends, (Proportioning his Furies, Fates and Fiends; But here she stopp't: for (looking on her worke, As if some ominous euent did lurke Vnder these dismall Pictures) from her eyes Teares (forming pearles) dropt on the Destinies: And (weary of that sad taske) she began To sort new colours to the Ocean; VVhose Crystall winding streames, she there drew out Vpon the vtmost border of her clowt. But suddainely the hinges of her dore, With creaking noyse were turn'd, and her before The goddesses she spies, so all in haste Th' imperfect worke and robe shee from her cast; With maiden blush and fearefull modestie, Vpon her siluer cheekes a skarlet dye
She spradde; vnlike to this, the Lydian Dame With Tyrian purple spots her yu'rie frame; Now Phaebus diu'd into the west, and night With lazie Carre, and dulnesse doth inuite The world to rest; whil'st Pluto warn'd by Ioue His iourney plot's, and conquest of his loue. And loe, th'vnseene Commandresse, secretly, Of fearefull wagon; to her axletree, The harnest thongs, and coupled horses ties Horses, that, on the filth and scumme which rise From bottome of Cocytus, feede: that graze In fields of Erebus and hels blacke laies, When (drunke with Let he) vp into the world Obliuion from their frothy mouthes is hurl'd. Orphnaeus (shaking his vnruly head) And Aethon (swift as flight) together tread And (trampling in th'infernall entrie) beate Each fire strucke flint from it's vnpaued seare: Nicteus, with his staring maine, the best Of Stygian brood, with braue Alaster drest And ready harnest; both together stand And (rear'd on end) Alectos sterne command. With scornefull neighing mocke: (full of disdaine) The cole black foure, scarcely themselues containe Within hell gates (madde) on their masters prize VVhich he expects, vpon the mornes vprise. Finis Libri Primi.
THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE. The Argument of the Second Booke. Proserpina suspectlesse of her woes With Venus, Pallas, and Diana goes To Aetna, on whose skirts the morning howr's They spend, and crowne their temples with his flowr's: Pluto his prey doth snatch; the goddesses Pallas and Dian, followe to release Their Sister: Ioue his clowdie sonne defends, That with loud triumph downe to bell descends. BY this, the sable vaile of night, from farre Vnsprad; and Phaebus in his golden Carre, Prickes on the fiery Steeds, that force their way And make new breach thorow th' Ionian Sea, Whilst (day yet mask't in night) his flaring beames, Play with the waues, and mocke the blue gods streames, About this morne peepe moment, the lost mayd Lost, for she now by Venus was betrayd, (Vnmindfull of her mothers strict command) For who can stricter Destinies with-stand?
Boldly awakes, forgets all feare or doubt, And to the dewy fields she sallies out; Out went she, but no sooner tripped o're The humble threshold, when her creaking dore, VVith turned hinge thrice squeak't; as if it meant To warne her from the desperate attempt. Thrice it presag'd, thrice (guilty of her fate) The neighbouring Aetna groan'd: but ah, too late! For headlong will of woman, now, in her, Rebellion nourished' gainst iuster feare. Out went she, and with her the sisters three, Those goddesses, that bore her companie; First iocund Venus hugg'd with her deceit, Glad, that the houre for which she long did wait Drew neere; but giaddest that her pow'rfull skill Could draw the pow'rs infernall to her will. The smooth-comb'd locks, that (on her golden head She weares) part (like two skeines) and as in thread Intangled, some crumples vp: so shee Some longer wore, some crispt and curled bee; In a rich purple mantle was she clad, O're which, a belt (her sweating husband had Fram'd in his Forge) she cast, which kept it on, Buckled ther'to with a rich Orient stone: Next Venus march't Licoeus beautious queene: She (whom th' Arcadian Swaines full oft haue seene Fell their wilde Bores; and she) whose stately lance Pandions Towr's protects, who doth aduance The Cities Trophies: this, in strife and iarre Bestirres her selfe (best pleas'd with bloudy warre. The other (a bold huntresse) loues to fright The wildest beasts that tremble at her sight.
Caru'd on a golden Helmet, Pallas bore Huge Typhons picture, (whom she long before Slew in Ioues quarrell:) Typhons vpper part Is dead, the lower liuing; so in part He liues, part dyes, that monstrous bulke of his, Halfe man, halfe serpent, vpward, down-ward is In her right hand a mighty speare she wields, That tow'rs vp to the sky, no wood that yeelds A tree so tall; and in her left hand, grac't With dazling shield was vgly Gorgon plac't, Crown'd with a head of snakes, whose visage grim And killing looke, she with a vaile keepes in. Dian appeares in a more mild aspect, More louely, and in euery respect So like her brother, that each siluer ray, (Vpon her glorious head) shin'd it (by day) Were Phoebus selfe: whose light, whose eminence She bore (Sex only breeding difference) Her azure plumpe vein'd armes discouered bare, And carelesse lockes playd with the gentle aire. Th'vnbended bowe now gaue her sinewes rest, And at her backe the shafts in quiuer rest: A short loose garment that she (fastned) weares With double girt, scarce from her knee appeares; On whose light ground (vnmatched to behold) The wandring Delos floats in seas of gold: With these, the ioy of Ceres, her deere child, But soone, neere griefe, keepes equall pace in field, Equall in limbes and honour, and might seeme Either of both; for euery one would deeme He saw a goddesse, and would thinke her so, Bore she but Pallas shield, or Phoebus bowe:
Her gather'd garment fastned with a knot By smoothest Iasper was; and she was not Inferior to the Sisters nor their skill, For she could couzen Natures selfe (at will) With art, which neuer happ'lier was showne, Then in the rare bestowing of her combe, On those two golden fleeces, that adorne Her wel-shap't head; where they so eu'n were worn That not the finest thred in loome of Lawne Agreed, or could more equally be drawne: Th'Imagery in silkes so liuely wrought On her loose robe, might please the very thought Of nice beholders; who, when they should see These pictures, and would iudge them but to bee, Inanimate dead trunkes, might Proserpine Pricke them but tongues, they'd speake and be diuine. The bults she workt were of a goddesse breed, (Resembling Sunne and Moone Hyperions seed) But in their shapes she fashion'd different quite, These two great Captaines of Aurora 'nd Night: Such, as when Thetis (they but tender, young, Short breathed Infants) with a Nurse-like song Rock't sleepe into their cradles, and doth take To her warme lappe those sucklings when they wake; Tytan, thus weake: (in his minoritie) Dimme lighted, and not clamber'd vp so high (As now) with mounting wing; in which first age Men faine him mild, and free from scorching rage: Thus, feeble Tytan, at his Dammes right side Lay panting; and as often as he cry'd, (For wantonnesse) so euer and anon It sobb's, and spits a gentle fire, vpon
The louing Mother; who to still and rest, Turnes to his sister her left side and brest: From whence, and at her Cristall dugge, she drinks That milke-sweet liquor, whil'st her Sire bethinks Him of the younglings: and the prettie Moone Viewes in the Mothers arme, vnto her soone; He (sporting) calls, the wayward babe, that showes With one eye turned vpward, that it knowes Nought but the dugge and Thetis, all else scornes, Mockes him (kind father) with her little hornes. In such great pompe, glitt'ring attire, she went: The Naides (on both sides of her) bent In friendly troope, to wait and beare her traine, Compasse her round, each stroue to be most faine. Those Nymphes Crymnisus, which thy fountaine cleere And thine Pantagia (whose swift course doth beare, And headlong rowle downe rocks:) do famous make That Riuer too from whence Gela doth take The Cities name, and they (slow Camarine) Which in those fennie shallow lakes of thine Are nourished; those that in Crystall brooke, And streames of Arethusa, all forsooke Their loued homes; and to make full the feast Alpheus sends his Nymphes, and 'mongst the rest That there attend in gratefull companie, None did excell the fairest Cyane. So Amazones in a triumphant band With sloped shields march through the foe-mans land: When man-like braue Hyppolita, with spoyle (From Arcton hill, laden with goods and toyle) Retires her snowy troopes; then, when they sweate In bloud of yellow Scythians, or beate,
And breake with sharpest axe the tougher Ice That stops the current of swift Tanais: So, the Moeonian Nymphes are wont to rise From Hermus, when their vs'd solemnities They giue to Bacchus, on whose festiuall Each, seuerally, and then, together, all Vpon their fathers gold swolne bankes run mad, Frisking about: the aged riuer (glad) Sits in his denne, and as their want he viewes VVater in plenty from moist vrne renewes; No sooner had flow'r-bearing Aetna spi'd, And from his hearby top farre off descri'd The sacred people; when milde Zepherus He forceth with entreates, and vrgeth thus: Thou grateful (wisht for father) of the Spring, That'bout my medowes (with lasciuious wing) Fly'st, and there reign'st, that with perpetuall blast Bedew'st the ground, mak'st it with freshnesse last: Looke yonder, looke vpon those Nymphes that play ('Mongst whom) the thund'rers plants to sport this day, Daigne midst my walkes; be thou propitious, Be present with thy odoriferous Sweet flowr's, now to their fulnesse blow them forth, Ripen the blossomes and those sprouts of worth, That fertile Hybla may at length confesse (But enuie) that her fuitfulnesse is lesse. VVhat euer sents the drie Arabia Breathes from her spices on the morning grey; VVhat odours flatt'ring sence Hydaspes sends From farre; what ere the rare bird (that extends Her flight to swartie Indians (there can find That (though she want a mate) can raise her kind
From her owne death and ashes, and renewes Past yeeres with youth: sweet Zephirus infuse The summe and all into these veines, and blow With fullest cheeks: cherish these fields, that so I may deserue the touch diuine, and pure Of goddesse finger; and so farre allure Those heau'nly pow'rs, they may be couetous To weare our flowry garlands on their browes: Here Aetna stopt, when straight the West-wind threw Shak't (from his madid wings) a Nectar new On the dry turfes, and ioines the clefted-earth, Begets in it a second fruitfull birth: Where e're he flies a Spring of Aprill show'rs Followes; the ground swels vp with hearbs and flow'rs, Which with their load (the moisture quickly spent) Bend downe againe, and (fading) lose their sent. This place he clotheth with the bloud-bright Rose, That, with young Hyacinthus, there bestowes The purple-painted (neere blacke) Violet. What belt on Parthian King was euer set In richer Iemmes? what more varietie In fleeces spotted with Assyrian dye? The Bird of Iuno in his greatest pride, Shewes but dull eyes (with these faire colours tride:) Not so (when watrish winter doth begin) The Raine-bow crownes him with oft varying, When streaking the pale Sunne with redder fire The moystned tracke, through clouds disperc't shewes cleere: The place exceeds the flowers: for a plaine Here crooking swels; there, seemes to rise againe In hillockes soft, till, farther it becomes A hill, where from a liuely punice runs
A bubling Spring, which growes into a Brooke, From which it's moisture the dew'd grasse doth sucke; For (as the Snake-like streame winds in and out) It snares the hearbes and flow'rs round about: The Woods coole leaues here serue for summers shade, (By whose thicke boughes VVinters cold frost's allayd) Where growes the Firre, the hard strong Cherrie-tree For ships, for bowes (in warre) that fittest be: Ioues loued Oke, young, and in vig'rous heat, The old, with luscious hony combes repleat: The mournfull Cypresse couering sepulchre, And Bay presaging Lawrel tree grew there: The thicke-topt, spreading, crisped Boxe, (whose weight) Doth make it waue, and totter from it's height: The Serpent-like slow Yuie, and the Elme Lac't with the Vine, makes it with Grapes o're-whelme. A Lake which the Sicilians, Pergus name, Was neere at hand; and to adorne the same, A rowe of well-plac't trees begirt it round, Whose silent water (free from noyse or sound) Lookes pale, and suffers the beholders eyes (Vnhurt) to search the bottomes secresies. The traine be'ing here arriu'd they ioy and sport To see the flowry Country, to exhort, Thus, Cytherea, them begins: Come, come, Sisters, and gather till the morning Sunne Drie the ayres sweat, whil'st yet my Lucifer (Mounted on dewy Courser) euery where Waters the yellow fields: so, hauing spoke, She first began to plucke a flow'r, first tooke The badge of her old griefe, then each doth striue And fall to worke; as when of Bees a Hiue
Snatches the sweets of Hyblas Tyme; or when Their Leaders with an Army (as 'mongst men) Remoue their waxen tents: or, when they creepe From hollow Beeches wombe, and (swarming) sweepe The dustie ayre; when (swolne with their cropt store) (Buzzing) they seeme to grumble yet for more. So they made hauocke of the flow'rs, and spoile Of all their glory, in a moments toyle. The Lilly to the darker Violet One weaues; another in her brest doth set The soft-sweet Marioram; a third must goe Starre-deckt with Roses; this in diff'ring showe Prankes vp her selfe with Priuet white, and thee They gather, and thy weeping Tragedie (Poore Hyacinth) renew; nor doe they spare Narcissus (both of you now branches rare Of the fresh spring, and in your liues, the ioyes Of Nature, two most excellent sweet boyes) Thee the tiles errour strooke, but thee, thine owne; When in the fountaine that selfe-loue was knowne: Apollo, with sad brow thy losse laments; At thine Cephissus broken reed relents: Proserpina, more greedy then the rest (Most hot vpon the spoile) culs out the best, And stuffes her Osier baskets full; that smile To see their Mistris the poore fields beguile Of their rich habit; she with garlands crownes Her temples (ignorant of fate) that frownes Vpon the wreath she weares (propheticall Swiftly fore-running the blacke Nuptiall) The warlike Goddesse, her right hand, that scowres The lustie troopes, that teares downe walls and towres,
Giues to an easier taske; layes by her speare Her glist'ring shield (vnus'd such toyes to beare) She teacheth now the garland to embrace, Her steele-topp't helmet sweetest garlands grace: Nor she, that in Parthenian Mountaines seekes With sure nos'd senters after chase, dislikes The sport, but her licentious lockes keepes downe, And bridles them with a faire garland crowne: Whil'st thus the scatter'd Virgins pull the flow'rs, Behold a noyse 'gan bellow, as if two tow'rs (Falling) had rush't together, or some Towne From it's foundations firme had bin cast downe, The cause none gest, but Paphos goddesse: she Was preinstructed in the mystery, And had this double passion at her choyse To feare with them, but inwardly reioice: And now the rector of the damn'd, below; Through secret windings bustles to and fro, To find a way to earth: first doth he fetch A compasse here and there; then makes a breach Aloft; his foggy Coursers trample on Enceladus, that with their weight doth groane, (The Gyants huge vaste limbes cut by their wheeles) Addes to the former torments that he feeles; And lab'ring, with a double yoke, in paine: (For he beares Dis and Aetna now) would faine Finde ease; the wearie Serpents (clinging) stay Their axletree, the horses force their way, And scudde along (too swift for them too slacke) Their fiery wheeles slide from his sulph'rous backe. And as the close besieger, by degrees Steales on his mu'd vp foe, that nought foresees,
VVhil'st he (by a laborious countermine And secret) the mockt wals doth vndermine; Whose strength and stricter guard none now protect, (The Conqu'rours entring, where they least expect) Like to these earth-borne men. Saturnes third heire Contriues a passage vp to the VVorld's aire His brothers Orbe, and giues his Steeds free reine Searcheth through eu'ry corner: but (in vaine) No gate appeares, huge heapes of rokces and stones Damme vp his passage eu'ry where; not once Discou'ring light, as purposely to keepe The god close pris'ner in that dungeon deepe; But he (enrag'd) brook't no delayes, and straight Aduanc't his beamy scepter, with whose weight He breakes the Rocks; teares the resisting ground, The blow caus'd all Sicilia's Caues resound, And Riuers rore; th'adiacent Islands shake, Amazed Vulcane suddaine flight doth take, (Leauing his forge) the trembling Cyclop's hide Their fearefull heads, and cast Ioues bolts aside; The poore cold dweller on steepe Appenine, And frozen passengers, that slowly climbe The hoary Alpes, amazed stand, and doubt Of some new broile 'twixt Ioue and Gyant rowt: Those that (along thy streames) with naked limbe Perpetuall trophie bearing Tyber, swimme, And those that to thy current famous Po Launch out their little barkes, heard that great blowe: So when (on lower Plaines of Thessalie) A standing poole (by rockie Mountaines high Inclos'd) denies vnto the marish ground Tillage; and pasture to the medowes drown'd;
Till angry Neptune with his Tridents pikes, Pierceth high Ossa, and cold Olympus strikes; Whose wounded sides open a passage wide, At which th'imprison'd waters (loos'ned) slide, The Floods vnto the Sea, and drier land Restored are, vnto the Husbandman. No sooner was Earths knotty vaile vndone (By Pluto) when Trinacria begun To spread her large and op'ning wombe; and now A suddaine fright, vpon the pallid brow Of heau'n appeares; the stars vnus'd to stray From their first course, seeke an vncertaine way: The two celestiall Beares that shone so bright In the forbidden Sea dash their dimme light. Lazy Boötes feare doth headlong cast, Orion trembles, Atlas stands aghast At hels Iades neighing, whose breath, misty steams Obscure heau'ns face, and Phoebus golden beams; His radiant brightnesse in the beasts doth breed A suddaine terror, for they vse to feed Perpetually in darknesse: now by fits, Betwixt their teeth they catch the champed bits, And (winding sidelong) their Coach beame would turne Backward to hell, and Chaos to returne. But when they once the Tarry whip perceiue Lash their blacke buttockes, quickly then they leaue Their strife; and (forc't to the new light) depart Swifter then winter floud, or Parthian dart: The violence of Southerne stormes is slowe To their quicke pace, that nimblest thoughts outgoe: The reines grow hot with their ranke bloud, and breath From fornace of their nostrils sends pale death
Into the purer ayre: their froth, vpon Th'vntroden sands leaues strong infection. The Nymphs all fled, saue Proserpine; (who caught And snatcht into the Chariot) besought The goddesses with screaking loud for ayde; Pallas that viewes her (how she was betrayd) Discouers Gorgons visage; Delta too To her reliefe hastens the horne-bent bowe: Nor giue they way vnto their Vncle, for Ioint Charitie incites them to this warre, Virginity in them and Proserpine (Alike) exasperates the fault and crime Of the bold rauisher; he keepes his way (Fearelesse:) as when the Lion makes a prey On some young Steere the beauty of the stall And herd, when with his pawes besmeared all In bloud, he diues into the naked brest Vntill his rau'nous hunger there supprest, Quarters out more, at length his appetite Quite slak't (with staring gaze that would affright) He carelesse stands, shaking his knotted maine (As if the Herdsmans threats hee did disdaine.) Thou ruler of the sluggish Orbe, thou worst (Quoth Pallas) of thy brothers; thou accurst: What Furies with their whips and brands profane Haue moou'd thee? that (thy kingdome left in vain) Thou dar'st pollute the earth: Away, begone: Chuse'mongst thy Dirae a Companion Worthy thy bed; thy brothers kingdome leaue And doe not others of their lot bereaue: Backe to thy night, why minglest thou the dead To liuers? why (a stranger) dost thou tread
Vpon our Globe? She thus exclaimes, and wounds The horn-hoof'd steeds (making them keep their bounds With her opposed shield) they stoppe, and shee With vprear'd launce was readie to let flee Against the Chariot, had not Heauens King (In signe of Truce) bow'd his red thund' ring Wing (Acknowledging his sonne) and from aboue The gaping Clouds, doth Hymen reapproue Th' eternall Knot; and with their blazing light, His flames, are witnesses to Pluto's right: The Goddesses forbore, Cinthia her Bow Vnbends, but addes these words vnto her woe. Be mindfull (ah farewell) the iust respect Of father, hath deni'de vs to protect Thy person, nor can wee in armes withstand Him, that inflicts on vs his dread command: Thy Sire is bent against thee, thou must goe Vnto those silent people (there below;) (Alas poore Virgin) and shalt neuer see Thy sisters more, nor equall companie. What fate? what fortune from aboue thee beares (Dooming the starres vnto perpetuall teares) No more my Nets shall bout Parthenian Caue Be spred, no more will I my Quiuer haue; And now securely may the wilder Boare Foame, and the raging Lyon freely roare: Taygetus and Arcadia shall bewaile Thee; when my hunting them begins to faile, Sad Cynthus-will bemoane thy destinie, And Delfo's Oracle must silent be: Whil'st thus she mournes, the wofull Proserpine (Her loose haire scatter'd to the Southerne wind)
(In swift▪drawne Chariot wringing her soft hands On sorrow-beaten brest) these vaine demands Powr's against heauen: why? ah why (quoth she) Didd'st thou not (father) cast thy darts at me By hands of Cyclops made? and not expell Thy daughter hence in dismall shades to dwell? No loue of father? could no pittie moue What fault of mine hath thus incenst great Ioue? When Phlegra rag'd in suddaine tumults, I No Banner waued' gainst their enemy, The gods; nor then by strength of mine at all Did frosty' Olympus on cold Ossa fall: What mischiefe haue I practis'd? of what fault Made guilty? am I banisht to hells Vault, Vaste op'ning iawes? happy, oh happy they, VVhom other Rauishers haue made their prey, And borne with them! at least in their annoy The common light, the Sun-shine such enioy: But I; Heau'n, Earth, Virginitie must leaue, The Stygian king doth me of shame bereaue: Oh ill lou'd flow'rs, mockt Parents counsailes ill, Sad triall learn't (too late) of Venus skill! My dearest Mother, whether Lydian song In Vale of Ida, thee detaine thus long: Or, whether thou to Dyndimus bee'st gone To bloudy sacrifice, there (looking on Cybels mad Priests, that with their drawn swords roame About those hils:) make haste and quickly come To my reliefe: succour my franticke griefe, Hold in the loose raines of this cruell thiefe. He at these words, and seemely mourning grew, A stronger melting passion to renew;
And with his sooty garment dries her teares (Temp'ring with mildest voice her cause-lesse feares:) Cease, sweetest Proserpine, to vexe thy minde With vaine laments, a husband thou shalt find Worthy thy loue; know, we are Saturnes sonne, That ouer all things beare dominion: Nor thinke that thou the gladsome day hast lost, Since we of starres and purer light may boast; VVhen thou th' Elizian brightnesse shalt admire, And happy soules free from tormenting fire, VVhere the more precious golden age doth keepe (In an eternall quiet lul'd asleepe:) Where Zephirus, faire flowr's of richest worth Breathes out (such as thy Aetna ne're brought forth) Where in the shadie Groues a rich tree growes, Whose arched boughes the golden Apple shews, That consecrate I to thee, and will make A happie lasting Autumne for thy sake: What e're the liquid ayre, what Aeolus Containes (my louely queene shall bee for vs, Earth, Seas and Riuers, all that in them liue, To thy commands shall their obeisance giue, The rich-clad purple kings shall humbly fall Before thy throne (mixt with the poore) for all Death equals; thou the guilty and vniust Shalt iudge, with them, the Innocent and Iust, Those shal bewaile their crimes, these shall be blest By thee, and sent into eternall rest: The Destinies vpon thy will shall waite, And what thou orderest be held for fate Immoueable: (this sayd) they now drew neere Hell gates, he enter'd with vnusuall cheere.
Like shaken leaues in saplesse Autumne cast, From trees to earth, by furious Southerne blast, Or rainie drops in a thicke Cloud or sand, By broken waues cast vp into the land: The damned soules in thronging multitude, To view their queene, boldly themselues intrude: At entrance of his Lords great Phlegeton Ariseth, and from boiling streames, vpon His bristled beard casts moisture, and that face All on a flame: the Fiends, each to his place And seuerall office them addresse; some chuse To set the Chariot vp, whil'st others loose Th'vnharnest couples (turning them to graze On their knowne pastures, blacke Cocytus layes: Part decke the Palace with rich Tapistrie (Set out with curious wrought Imagerie:) Part drest the windowes with fresh flow'rs; within, The Nuptiall bed, others with Cou'rings trimme: Th' Elizian Matrons round begirt their queene In a chaste troope (whose tender sorrow seene By sweet words eas'd) they order her loose haire, And hide with flaming vaile the shame-fac't faire The Region pale and bleak, wanne ghosts now free, Doc frolicke in triumphant iollity; (Darke silence interrupted) loud they sing, And horrid peales with noyse (vndaunted) ring Hels grones now ceast, and (filth of vgly night Disperc't) she's rarifi'd with purer light: Minos no more casts lotts, the soules condemn'd Of their dilated paines now find an end; No lash resounds; Ixion from his wheele Is loos'ned, and (refresht) doth comfort feele:
Poore Tantalus the enuious water sippes, And tast's the fruit erst mockt his thirsty lippes: Tytius vaste limbes are raysed from the ground, (Where he nine Acres couer'd) and vnbound, (The rau'nous Vulture from his panting brest Dissolu'd) laments (as a forbidden guest:) The Furies now forgetfull of their rage, With softest notes, their strict reuenge asswage, Huge goblets they prepare, and drinke a fill Of wine, in which their monstrous locks they swil; To the Cerastes powre carowses deepe, (Whil'st with new light still burning fresh they keepe The festiuall spent Torches:) now, you take A safer flight ouer Auernus Lake (Then erst) you birds; (still wont to sacrifice Your selues to vapours thicke that thence arise.) (Amsanctus current swift now stopt) the noyse Ceas't, boiling Acheron 'gan loud rejoice, That his hot waues (turn'd to a fountaine) run Coole streames of milke; which, they had neuer done Till now; And now Cocytus flourishing (All clad in Yuie) offers to hells king A standing Poole, and of Lyaeus store, Of sacred liquor. Atropos forbore (In signe of triumph now) with cruell hand Lifes thred to cut: at Plutos dire command Death stops his progresse, now no teares are spent, Nor Kindred, Kindreds Funerals lament: The Sea man scapes all stormes; the Souldier, he Securely fights (from shot and sharp pike free;) Free from contagion healthy Cities are, Free from the plagues of famine, sicknesse, warre:
Old Charon crown'd with reedsbetwixt each shore Keepes singing time with stroke of idle Oare: The Eu'ning Hesperus (descending) fled To th'Orbes below: now to her Nuptiall bed The Virgin's brought, starre-painted night lookes on As (witnesse) to the marriage: she, vpon Them both show'rs happy blessings to ensue From this eternall vnion, and a crew Of blest Elizian Saints thus sweetly sing, Presaging notes to their faire Queene and King. Our Mother Iuno, and of thundring Ioue (Thou Sonne in lawe, and brother) may all loue Beget soft rest vnto you both; and knit Those mutuall neckes in your embraces fit. A prosp'rous race growes toward now; and glad Nature expects more gods: oh may you adde New deities, new pow'rs to hells affaires, Make Ceres Grandam to your wished heires. Finis Libri Secundi.
THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE. The Argument of the Third Booke. Ioue calls a Synode of the gods, reueales His will: each of them, secretly, concealcs The rape, from Ceres vnto Phrigia gone, She dreames, returneth home (her losse being knowne) 'Gainst gods sh'exclaimes (enrag'd) the world about Searcheth with lights her daughter to find out. WHil'st hell thus triumphs, Iupiter aboue Commands Thaumantis (girt with clowds to moue, And summon vp the pow'rs of earth and seas, (Clad all in red) she downeward slides, with ease, On Zephires wings; the gods, the Sea Nymphes all, And riuers, from their humid dens doth call: ('Twixt feare and doubt they rowse themselues) but muse What new occasion, or what suddaine newes Disturbes their quiet rest; and (being come To heauens starre-Chamber) each their proper roome And place prouided haue, with order fit; In the first ranke the gods Celestiall sit:
And in the second, the Sea pow'rs are plac't, Calme Nereus, and aged Phorcus, grac't With comely hoarinesse; (next these, biform'd Glaucus was set, and Proteus (vntransform'd) In his owne shape: the ancient and great Riuers were honour'd with a seu'rall seate; But thousand lesser Brookes (as was most meet For youth) like common rowt stood on their feet: The VVater-Nymphes, each, to her liquid Sire Leanes, and dumbe gazing Fawns, heau'ns stars admire. Then the graue father from Olympus high Thus spoke, and breathed forth this mysterie: At length, the care of mans affaires, againe Solicites me, which, since the lazie reigne Of idle Saturne long neglected were; VVhen we perceiu'd how men secure from feare, Lay steep't and buri'd in my fathers sloth, Then to giue further suff'rance we were loth: But (willing to reforme the same in part) Spurr'd vp inuention, and gaue reines to Art: Then were we pleased that th' vntilled field (Lesse liberall) lesse store of Graine should yeeld: That hony in the woods more scarce should grow, And wine no more from swelling Fountaines flow: Not that we enuious were, or basely prone To pois'nous malice; but, when ouer-growne VVe plenty saw, and easefull ryot, blind The light of reason, to disswade mankind VVe willing were, dull spirits to reuiue: That each man might by his owne labour liue, That, sharpe necessity should then produce And bring forth arts (to be brought vp by vse.)
But Nature vrgeth vs (with sad complaint) To ease poore man (for such a burden faint) And (hauing to my charge the Tyrant layd) VVith former golden age doth vs vpbrayd; She calls Ioue, Miser, sayes; that she is franke, Exclaimes, that we, the fields with thistles ranke And to growe barren, suffer: that the yeere Doth fruitlesse passe. That she, (who vnto mortals long did vowe Her selfe Kinde mother) is turn'd Stepdame now▪ And thus proceeds: what boots it, wretched man To haue a soule (from heauen infus'd) that can Discourse and reason, and his lofty head Lift vp; if he like beasts a life must lead, (VVandring with them in the wild woods, to get The fruit of Swinish acorns for his meate? Is this (sayth she) to liue? with such distast The common mother vrg'd, that we; at last Contented were, she thus much should obtaine, That from Chaonian food her sonnes abstaine; To which effect, we solemnly decree: That, Ceres, of her daughters Destinie Witlesse (who now with her curst Damme remaines, Lashing th' Idean Lyons o're those Plaines) With wailefull mourning search the world throughout, Till (hauing in th' end of her pledge found out) In signe of her new ioy (for old griefe past) Huge heapes of haruest she may from her cast, From golden Carre, and spread ripe eares of corne Vpon the fields by her blue Dragons borne. But list, you gods; if any here reueale The rape of Proserpine; or not conceale
The Rauisher from Ceres, I protest A gen'rall ruine to the peace and rest Of things; (be he a sonne, or sister she, Or wife of mine, or that deere daughter be That from my brain-pan boasts her birth) shal feele The stroke of thunder and reuengefull steele Of Gorgons fury: and though she must liue, (For deities dye not) yet shall she grieue To haue been borne of heauen, and wish for death. Like punishment my vengeance shall vnsheath On any of you (Riuers) that withstand The secresie of this my strict command: (By me first wounded) him, my sonne in lawe Repunish shall; this for a sacred lawe Establish't stand: (this sayd) and past for fate, The starres were shak't, and seate whereon he sate. And now the apparitions of blacke night, And fearefull mischiefe Ceres do affright: Who (absent from this Synode, and secure) To her still thought could sweetest rest procure; But now each moment doth ingeminate Her doubtfull feares, and vgly night (as fate) Whispers the sad mishap of Proserpine, Who, (in each dreame of hers) seemes to decline More from her pristine being; eu'ry sleepe Of Ceres, her vext soule in cares doth steepe. So still she groanes in night, and when day comes, Cold wonderment her stupid sence benummes, Till next night's fantasies, in which; a dart, One while (her seemeth) to her daughters heart Fast'ned appeares; and (as a horrid sight) She loathes her garment chang'd from chastest white:
The trees that in her walkes she long did know Barren, now fresh (she thinkes) and fruitfull growe: But one (amongst them all) she liked best, Whose shamefac't leaues seru'd for a shade in rest To Proserpine: the Bay tree that, she sees Cut from the root, and by strange cruelties Of art, the boughes lopt off; boughes, that abouud In freshnesse, now ly wither'd on the ground, And (as she thought) of this great wickednesse Enquiring, wofull Driades expresse The lamentable Storie; here (say they) The raging Fiends haue made a bloudy Fray VVith hellish axe; and layd the dust along Thy lawrell greene, fresh feeling of it's wrong. At length, all circumstances, all disguise Vnmask'd, poore Ceres her ill fortune spies In her owne child, that now her selfe appeares Her owne forc't-messenger, wet-visage, cleeres All wau'ring doubts, which (when the goddesse wakes) She puts away, and on her, new griefe takes; For Proserpine appear'd, as if she seem'd Shut in close prison, and her mother deem'd Her fetter'd with strong shackles, not as she VVas left by her in fruitfull Stcilie; Nor (as the goddesses her found, when they In Aetnas rosie vallies her astray Did leade, but now; those lockes she might behold (VVhilome surprissing ambar and faire gold In brightnes) squallid blacke, the sparkling light Fire of her eyes, extinguisht is by night, A night of sorrow, and that blushing red Vpon her cheeke (exhaust with cold) growne dead.
The Rubies, of her well grac't lippes quite spent, And limbes, then snow erst whiter, with the sent And colour of hels pitch, defil'd, to view Of Ceres, were so strange, she scarce her knew: Yet, seeing her so chang'd: goods! what a sight Is here (sayth she?) what bitter wofull plight? What fault? what punishments are these? what face? What macerated monster of disgrace Is this? (she addes:) who thus hath pow'r (she cries) Hath pow'r thus much on vs to tyrannize? Why bearest thou these bonds, this chaine, vnfit For wild beasts? Doe thy soft armes merit it? Art thou (quoth she) my child, or dreame I, art mine? VVhen the vex't Image of poore Proserpine Reply'd with terrour: Mother, oh, thou blinde Mother; oh thou to thy lost child vnkinde Could'st thou (more cruell then the Lyons) whom Thou kept'st in awe, so long thy comming home Deferre; and me that was thine only deare, So long forget, was I despis'd? then heare A dolefull truth, that name of Proserpine So sweet to thee; so lou'd, so only thine, Only that name remaines: for, see, behold VVhat punishment, what bonds do me infold: But (cruell) thou in vprore with a song Through Phrigian Cities hurri'st, and of wrong To me art witlesse; yet, if mothers brest Haue not quite lest thee: if thou yet, it blest And holy Ceres bear'st the name, let me Begge one boone at thy hands (my liberty:) Carry me vp againe, but if too late I striue 'gainst Ioue, and my prefixed fate:
If backe I neuer must returne; yet thou, At least, with comfortable visit now Come see mee: thus she spake, and going about To stretch her hands, she could not hold them out, (So clogg'd with yr'ns) that (as she vanisht) shook: (At which noyse) Ceres fearefully awoke, Glad, that the vision had no trewer prou'd, But sorry for the want of her belou'd; Vp straight she gets in a distracted mood, And to Cybele doth her griefes vnloade: No longer (sacred Parent) can I stay In Phrigian ground; the care calls me away Of dearest child, she's yet a Girle and young, Knowes not the danger of a flatt'ring tongue: Her tender yeeres vnto all hazard yet Doe her expose, nor do those buildings great And trustie, of the Cyclops, me assure: Each blast of fame, doth make me lesse secure Of safety (lest she to the gods reueale My secret house) nor can the Isle conceale My daughters being there (it being a place So famous) and withall th'apparent blaze Of Aetna, and Enceladus deepe groanes Cannot be hid, nor silenced his moanes. My boading dreames in sundry vncouth formes Presage, and eu'ry dreame sends fresh alar'mes Of doubts vnto me, my Propheticke thought Still threatens, and hath still vpon me wrought. As often as the crowne of golden eares Falls from my head of't selfe, vp get my feares As oft, and stirre the bloud that on my brest Stands in a sweat, whil'st I (perplext) no rest
Can take: then on a suddaine doe arise Two streames, that breake from my vnwilling eyes, My rebell hand doth beate my trembling heart, VVhen I would touch my pipe (it seemes) all Art And sweetnesse failes; that nothing doth remaine But the dead sound, and (being in this vaine) My Tymbrel's strokes, nought but sad sounds forth send; All things (I feare) my griefes to come portend: Delay is dangerous, such words (replyes Cybele) may they frustrate mount the skies; Ioue's not so slacke: but (to her latest end) VVith thunder, will be ready to defend His pledge; but thou thy iourney onward haste, And backe returne, when thy false feare's ore'past: Ceres takes leaue, the Temple leaues, and set Vpon her Chariot) thinkes the Dragons yet Are dull and lazy, with her lash that rings In th'ayre, belabours their alternate wings: Tow'rd Sicilie she driues amaine, and scant O're Ida, but despaires, suspects her want. As a poore bird (of tender young bereft, VVho to some tree or lower hedge were left, Whil'st she prepar'd them food; euer from whence Her flight she takes, a kind of troubled sence, Tender remorse she hath: first, lest the wind Her nest blowe downe; next, lest she empty find The same (to men or Snakes a prey) so she, So Ceres, when she saw the custodie Faile, and the watch-folke of her house all gone, The postes broke vp, hinges cast downe, vpon Her out-roomes desolate; with such a sight And vnexpected change, all in a fright
Her clothes she rent, and from her soft haire teares The sprigges and it; this madnesse dry'd her teares, Nor had she breath to speake; but hauing spent VVith trembling, all her spirits (as she went Forward) the first step was a stumble still, Yet on she goes, and with a madding will VVanders about, to view these emptie roomes: (As she from one into another comes) On a disorder'd frame at length she lights, The worker well she knew, but poorely slights Th'imperfect piece, for (the diuine worke, spy'd) She found, that the bold Spider had supply'd VVith sacrilegious webbe, that emptie space: Yet she nor wept, nor grieu'd; but kist the place And cloth vnfinished, vpon those threds She spends her dumbe complaints, and thinks she reades Her daughter, on those faces: eu'ry toy About the scatter'd roomes, doth she enjoy And hugge for Proserpine: now the chast couch And forlorne bed inuites her to approach, Which sluttishly (vnmade) seemes to complaine For want of the soft waight it did sustaine. Amaz'd she stands, (strook dumbe, in such distresse Like a poore Swaine, or simple Shepheardesse, (Whose flocke, whil'st she was farre from their reliefe To Africke Lyons rage, or cunning thiefe, Expos'd) too late can she returne, and calls The beasts (in vaine) within their hurdle walls; So Ceres: and in th'vtmost roome she spy'd Electra, Nurse vnto her child, a tride Seruant of hers; and of the Ocean The most knowne ancient Nymph (from whence shee came.
Like Ceres selfe, in goodnesse; this was she That Proserpine from tender infancie Bore at her brest; and, till she went alone, Was vs'd for sport, Ioues thigh to set her on. This her Companion was, her Guard select, Whom (next her Mother) she would most respect. When her thus Ceres found, rob'd of her trust, With hoarie lockes now scatter'd in the dust, (After a volley of loud sighes) the reines To griefe she loosens, and breathes out her paines: VVhat sacke is this (said she?) And are we giu'n A prey to Titans hoast? Reignes Ioue in Heau'n? (The Thund'rer liuing) who durst be so bold? VVho durst commit this outrage, vncontrol'd? Typhoeus, Alcyoneus, haue these Broke from the Mountaines, giu'n their yoakt-necks ease? Or hath my neighbour Aetna, Enceladus Freed? Or my household gods, Briareus And seat destroy'd? Ah, where art thou (my Deare) Those handmaids that attended on thee, where? VVhere, where is Cyane? what violence, My chanting Syrens, hath remou'd you hence? Is this your faith? is this your loyaltie, To keepe anothers Pledge from danger free? The poore Nurse trembled, and her griefe gaue place To stronger feare; not to haue seene the face Of wofull Ceres, she would gladly'haue dy'de: Sencelesse, amaz'd, a while she doth abide, (As loth the doubtfull mischiefe to disclose) Vntill at length, dispensing with her woes And passions, thus she spake: I would the mad And raging Armie of the Gyants had
Beene actors in this mischiefe; common things Doe lesse affect vs, sorrow that most wrings Is that which by our neerest friends is sought, And such is thine, for goddesses haue wrought, Conspir'd thy ruine, nay (which least of all Thou migh'tst suspect) sisters, did cause our fall: The trech'rous gods and woundes here behold Ofenui'ous kindred, that their bloods haue sold. Phlegra 'gainst heau'n was ne're so furious, As heau'n 'gainst thee (all vnpropitious) Thy house a happy quiet did possesse, While the chaste Virgin neuer would expresse A thought of gadding, or scarce once bestowe Her dainty foote (one only step to goe Ouer the threshold) neither durst she make A sally to the fields, fresh ayre to take. So strict she was to thy commands, so bent To herlou'd worke: at which (though tyr'd and spent) All the delight and solace she desir'd Was, from her Syrens songs and notes admir'd. I was her bosome friend, she would impart To me, the ioyes or sorrowes of her heart; I was her bed-fellow, and to each sport (As a companion should I still resort:) Thus past we fairely on, till Venus came Drawne hither (doubtfull) by what blast of fame; And that she might the lesse suspected be, Phoebe and Pallas are her companie: With cunning smiles, and fain'd embraces soft She often hugges thy daughter, and as oft The name of sister iterates; complaines, On her hard Mother: that so much restraines
Her, from wisht libertie; and thinkes it strange That thou abroad so farre from home could'st range, And leaue her in this solitarie place; Farre from her fathers kingdome, that the face Of heauen scarce she sees: and (that which most Doth pittie moue, her conuersation lost With kindred gods) the simple Mayd gaue care (Caught by this wily chat, and free from feare) The goddesses she makes her welcome ghests, Whom, with quaint cates and Nectar store she feasts: The banquet done in sport and merriment She wore Diana's robe, and her bowe bent With tender finger drew; and sought to wield Minerua's golden head-piece, and huge shield: But Venus, straight, deceitfully' gan prayse Aetna's high top, and to the skies to rayse The Vallies flow'rs, and something her admir'd, Of which, she wittingly, witlesse enquir'd: She could not thinke, or easily beleeue The Rose, from all those frosts preseru'd, should liue: Or that the colder Months should there retaine The Summers grasse, all winter to remaine; Nor, that the tender blossomes of the Spring Are nip't, by ang'ry Bootes blustering: (Thus praysing and thus doubting) with desire To see the place, her brest was set on fire; Thy tender Virgins fraile, vnwary yeeres Made her consent to goe, t'encrease my feares. What teares spent I, to hinder her (in vaine?) How little did my'ntreaties (fruitlesse) gaine From her? that (now resolu'd and confident) In sisters guard (together with them went?)
And (a large traine of Nymphs t'attend them seene Vnto the Medowes cloth'd in lasting greene) With the first morning light, when as the field Yet chill with dewe, heau'ns liquid iuice doth yeeld To banke of Violets; they gather'd there The moyst'ned flow'rs, that, with perle drops appeare: But when the Sunne grew to the mid-dayes height, The Pole was ceaz'd on, by vnlook't-for night: The trembling Island then began to reele And nod (shak't by the noyse of Chariot wheele, Of horses neighing) nor could it appeare (Whether the Coach-man Deaths fore-runner were, Or death her selfe:) the grasse and riuers great Were dri'd, the fields, straight burnt with parching heat: All things were blasted; there, the Priuet white We sawe, the Rose and Lilly alter'd quite From natiue sent and colour: eu'ry flow'r The pestilent contagion blasteth o're: And (as the hoarse fell steers-man turn'd againe, With horrid out-cries of each beast the raine) Backe with the hell-blacke Chariot returnes night, And to the World the day-restored light Discouers our sad losse and heauinesse: For now no Proserpine, nor goddesses Were seene; for she deare soule was rapt away, And they (that act performed) made no stay: Poore Cyane vpon the Meddow ground Strooke dead, with cold amazement next we found; And (as she lay) the garland from her browe. We tooke, whose fresher flow'rs were wither'd now VVith the hot steame: there each of vs enquires, And of our Mistris hap to know desires
Of her (who neerest was to the successe) Each of vs with vncertaine doubtfulnesse Demands the colour of the Steeds, and who The Coach-man was; but she (that melts in woe) Nothing replyes, of nothing vs resolues: But (metamorphos'd) secretly dissolues Her selfe into a Fountaine; that soft haire Vpon her head, her feet new turned are Into a dew; those armes diffused growe In streams, that (following our foot-steps) o're-flow. The rest fled, and our Mer-mayds with swift wing Trudge to Pelorus, and (for griefe) to sing, Since, cease: and now (in stead of melody) Plagues they portend, and dire mortality; And their soft voices now serue but t'entice Th'vnheedy Mariner, that in a trice (Answ'ring their calls) finds his vnhappy end; Of all thy seruants, I alone t'attend Thy sorrowes liue: Ceres in deepe suspence, (Foole that she was) hop't that yet no offence Was past, and still to come; but by and by That moode she changeth, and (with fi'ry eye Turn'd in her head, her brest enrag'd) aboue Vp to the gods she flings (with plaints to moue) As a fierce Tygresse, when her den's forlorne Of tender young, (by fearefull horse-man borne To Persian king, madding) out strips the wind; (Dispersing all her rage, and fury blind In shining spots:) at length she ouertakes The Hunter, and with yawning wide mouth makes Him leaue his prey; but in a shape of glasse He coozens the poore beast, and safe doth passe
Onward his way: th'enraged Mother thus Throughout all heauen stormes: restore to vs Restore, sh'exclaimes; we are no wandring brood Of some base Riuer, nor Plebeian blood Of Driades flowes from vs; Saturne high Begot me on the tow'ry Cybele: Where is the priuiledge of gods then? where You gods, of those drad lawes the sacred feare? What bootes a vertuous life, or what? the faire Title of good, if Cytherea dare, If shamelesse she presume to shew that face (Vnmask't by Lemnian nets, to her disgrace?) That wholsome sleep, the couch, those twynings chaste Of her and Mars, made her thus bold at last With me and mine: since when (no maruaile) though Such deeds, and such base actions from her flowe: But what? are you turn'd Pandoresses, your; Dian and Pallas, that yet neuer knew What lust meant? Is your mayden honour gone? Are your vowes chang'd, that thus you waited on Venus and her bolde Ruffian? (suffice:) You both deseru'd the bloudy sacrifice Of thirsty Scythian altar: let me know The reason of your rage; what mou'd you so 'Gainst Proserpine? did she in word or thought Offend you euer, had she euer sought Texpell thee, Delia, from thy groues? or e're Did she, Tritonia, thy strong armes beare. Or was sh'offenfiue in her speech? or rude, (Her selfe into your dances to intrude?) Oh no: Trinacria was her loued home, She neuer stirr'd, neuer from thence would roame:
But what auail'd such priuacie? no day, No time, could keepe your enuious eyes away: Thus she the goddesses (that silent were, Aw'd by great Ioue) blam'd with her speech seuere: (Silent) they nought would know, and no reliefe Could giue, but teares (sad Eccho's to her griefe) VVhat should she doe? yet to another straine She (falls) into intreaties mild againe. Pardon (quoth shee) yee deities, if loue, If my too strong affection, did moue A wretch to those extremes, that were vnfit; Pardon ye Powr's diuine and pittie it. Looke, how I kneele; looke, how mine age doth bow Lowe at your feete: (thus prostrate) let me know (Only) the certainty of my sad state, The manner of my woes vnfortunate: (VVhat e're) let me but knowe it; I shall thinke, That fate (not mischiefe) made my fortunes sinke: Let me but see my daughter once: not? no? Shall I, the search of mine owne bloud forgoe? But, feare not (whosoe're thou art: thy prey Safely enioy; I, to thy choyse giue way. And if the Rauisher (you goddesses) Haue brib'd you, for your silence? yet confesse, At least (Latona) thou, thou that too well, Lucina's name, and our great paines canst tell; That double birth, the twinnes (which thou didst beare) VVell testifie, how much the loue and feare Of children costs vs; thou, still happy art In two, whil'st I of one haue lost my part: So maist thou euer (to thy wisht desire) Enioy thy yellow sonne and daughter deere.
The goddesses (at these fresh plaint's) no pow'r Had, to refraine; but with a second show'r Of teares, they wash't their cheekes: poore remedie (She sayth) your weeping silence giues to me: Ay me! they all are fled; why stand'st thou here? VVhy stay'st thou longer, and perceiu'st not cleere, That heauen is arm'd against thee? rather haste, Search eu'ry nooke of land, the Ocean vaste: I will, and follow the diurnall Sunne (Vnweari'd) with him in swift course to runne, Through hidden wayes; not an houre of rest, No sleepe shall seyze vpon his troubled brest, Till my lost pledge I finde: (whether her graue Be digg'd by Thetis in Iberian waue; Or in the Red-Sea she intrenched be) No place, no secret corner shall goe free: Not frosty Rhenus, or Riphaean cold, Nor heate of Lybian sands, shall me with-hold From strictest search; and (till I find her out) The vtmost limits will I prye throughout, Of Southerne winde, and (for a further proofe) Will visit Boreas in his snowie roofe: Then, will I tread on Atlas in the West; Next, with my flaming torches in the East Hidaspcs shines; then looke vpon me, Ioue: Looke, how this wandring vagamund shall roue, Through Townes and Countries: doe thou look on me, Thou Iuno; and in my destruction, see And reape thy full content: then, then, no more Grieue at this riuall (thy base husbands whore.) Insult yee proud gods at my fortunes mocke, Boast your great triumph on poore Ceres stocke.
Thus spoke she, and from off the lofty top Of her knowne Aetna downeward slid, to lop The branches from those trees that must giue light, And guide her errant labours in the night: Neere to the Riuer Acis, stood a Groue (Whose little streames, in memorie of loue) Faire Galatea to the Sea prefers, And oft there bathes the beautious limbes of hers: The trees grew thick here; their intangled boughs On eu'ry side shadow high Aetna's browes; Thither brought Iupiter the captiu'd prey Which, he (long since) had got in Gyant frey: The wood grew proud of that Phlegraean broile, And victorie, cloath'd eu'ry tree with spoile; Here, the vast iawes, and each prodigious limbe Of Gyants hung, their heads, their faces grimme. (Yet threatning) to those boughlesse trunks are fixt And fastned: ('mongst which) the bones are mixt, Of scatter'd Serpents, and their rugged skinnes (Shrunk vp by thunder from their wither'd finnes:) No tree, here grew, that not preseru'd the fame, And of some conquer'd Gyant bore a name. This, of Aegeons hundred hands, the steele, (Whose waight her crooked branches bent:) did feele That Caeus Armes, this shield of Mimas wore, A groaning fourth naked Ophton bore. And last, a Firre tree (taller then the rest, For broad shade-spreading leaues, 'mongst all, the best) The smoakie Trophies of Enceladus Their king, did load: the waight (so ponderous) Had broke the body of that goodly tree (Did not a strong Oake prop with neere supplie:
So sacred was the feare and piety To this most memorable groue, that free From least offence, the heauenly Trophies hung; Nor durst rude shepheards rustick pipe and song Draw hither, their faint bleating flocks to shade; Nor Cyclop's once with cruell axe inuade The lustie Oake: when Poliphemus spies This place, he from the sacred shadow flyes. But neither deity, nor reuerence Of zeale, religion of the place; from thence Long kept th'incensed Ceres, whose strong arme VVith wheeling Sythe (to their lamented harme) Cuts downe the trunklesse bodies: (in this mood) Eu'n Ioue she wounds; the Pine tree falls, nor stood The smoother Cedar, but doth prostrate fall, Here, she destroies; there, leaues: and (last of all) She lookes vpon her handy-worke, and viewes The mangled bodies (which of them to chuse Fit'st for her purpose:) so, the Marchants care Prouides (for safety of his life and ware, VVhich he transports, to some long voyage bent) ('Gainst angry stormes and tempests prouident.) (First, the tall Cedar and hard Beech applyde To the maine mast and rudder, the Barkes guide) The softer wood to the light Oare he giues, And strongest trees for moisture Keele contriues. Two neighb'ring Cypresses, there, lift on high Their tow'ring, vntouch't heads (that kisse the skie) Such two on Ida's toppe, fleete Simois Did neuer see; Orontes, such (as these) Did neuer sprinkle with swift streames (that flow Vnto Apollo's Groue, where none such grow)
So equall in their height, and boughs esteem'd, So eu'n they grew, that brother-twins they seem'd; (Despising with their fellow-tops, the groue:) These, Ceres chose for torches; and would proue Her stubborn strength vpon them both; when (first) Her armes she tuck't, then folded vp her skirt: Next, with sharpe axe, she hewes alternately The two, (that on the ground straight grouelingly Alike, they suffer'd in their fall) alike, Their locks they shed, the Fawns & wet Nymphs shricke (For griefe) to view their ruine (as they lay) Shee lifts them vp, and beares with her away: (The loose haire turn'd ouer her shoulder) she Descends from panting Mountaines suddainely, Through flames she goes, through craggy rockes doth teare A passage; the parch't sands (that skorne to beare Her steppes) she kickes. So, curs'd Maegaera hastens the wisht light Of fatall Yew trees, when some horrid slight She practiseth 'gainst Cadmus, Theban walls; Or, when her malice and pale veng'ance falls On poore Thyesti'an towne; darknesse and Fiends Make her a lane to passe (as she descends To Phlegeton) in whose hot waues she dipp't The deadly lights, that with his flames were typ't: So, when the goddesse was arriu'd at last; At the Rockes scorching mouth, she from her cast The Cypresses, into those iawes (her face Turn'd from the smoake) now eu'ry hollow place Was fill'd, and the contracted fire (with-drawne) Kept in the flames, and stopt their wauing yawne:
The Mountaine rumbles, Mulciber 'gan striue (Halfe choak't) th'imprison'd vapours to relieue. When, loe; the berry-bearing Cypresse leaues Did shine, and sulphure mixt (that to them cleaues) Made the boughs crackle, and high Aetna raise His old flames higher by this new-come blaze. Then tooke she vp the fire-brands (whose dimme light Lest it should faile her in the tedious flight) She 'nointed with the iuice that Phaeton His Steeds; and liquor that the Moone, vpon Her Heifers, sprinkles. Now soft rest doth creepe On mortall browes, their eye-lids folds in sleepe: Whil'st she (with griefe-torne heart vpon her way And progresse) something thus t'her selfe would say: Full little did I thinke (while thou wert mine) To looke thee with these lights (my Proserpine;) Lou'd Mothers wishes, feruent strong desire Of marri'ge bed, and holy Nuptiall fire Were my delights: and oh! how I did long, In heau'n to heare the Saffron Hymens song. But Lachesis (that makes no difference 'Twixt men and gods) would not with me dispence: How honour'd was I lately, how ador'd By Suters great, that me for thee implor'd? What Mother (though she ne're so fruitfull were) But thought me happier then her selfe (to beare Eu'n thee alone) my first, my latestioy: By thee my barrennesse did fruit enjoy: By thee was I a goddesse (deifi'd) (Whil'st thou my glory wer't, thy Mothers pride:) I neuer vnto Iuno 'inferior was (Whil'st thou had'st being squallid now and base)
Gramercie, Ioue: but why giue I a part To him? (my selfe the causer of my smart) 'Twas I, 'twas cruell I; now I disclose My carelesnesse, that thee, to busie foes Forsaken, left: whil'st I (securely glad) Frisk't to the noyse of Bacchus daunces (madde) And with the sound of ratling armes (vnkind) (Whil'st thou wert rapt) the Phrigian Lion ioin'd To the swift Chariot; but behold (my sweet) The punishment for these deseruings meet. Looke on the gaping wounds vpon my face, The red-turn'd furrowes, that my brest deface; My wombe (vnmindfull) that it thee had borne, Looke, how by frequent strokes 'tis rent and torne: Where shall I seeke thee, in which heauen aboue? Vnder what Clymate here, on earth do'st moue? What guide, what tracke shall leade me? (might I know But in what kind of Chariotthou didst goe, Where the damn'd thiefe doth liue, in earth or seas?) The print of the swift wheeles my sight would please. I goe, I goe, where my faint plants shall guide, Whether blind chance: sorrow, like this betide Diona (all forsaken) may she looke. For her lost Venus. Shall it be lawfull, will some Destinie Giue way (my child) that once more I may see, Once more embrace thee? doth that beauty reigne Vpon thy cheekes, and freshnesse still remaine? Or shall I hap (vnhappy) to behold Thee such, as night and dreams haue oft foretold? Thus sayd she; and the first step she aduanc't From Aetna, on the flow'rs to light, she chanc't:
Those flowr's, that to her griefe, her daughters fate Were conscious: she detests with cursing hate Those, and the place (made priuie to the rape:) Then (through confus'd pathes) she her course doth shape, Pryes through the fields with blazing light, and lowe Sh'inclines the brands (all comfortlesse) in woe, With teares she bathes her cheekes: teares, that abound; (Producing sighes and groanes, that with their sound Ring in th'ayre and woods) the flaming light Now spreds on farre, whose shadow in calme night Swimmes on the Seas; the blaze of it doth flie To Lybian coast, and bankes of Italy; Th' Etruscan shore was bright and cleerly seene, And (from th' inflamed Seas) the Sirtes shine. Next vnto Scilla's dennes she goes, the light Vnusuall, those mad dogges did affright: VVhl'st (some astonisht) silent were (the rest More hardy) bark't at their vnwelcome guest. Finis Libri Tertij.
