English royal blazon blazon of the City of London Retailing Brokers, Commune Concilium tentum in Camera Guihalde Ciuitatis Londini, nono die Aprilis, Anno Regni Dominae nostrae Elizabethae, Deigratia An∣gliae, Franciae, & Hiberniae Reginae, fidei defensoris &c. Tricesimo septimo. Coram Iohanne Spencer, Maiore Ciuitatis Londini, & Aldermannis eiusdem Ciuitatis, ac maiore parte Com∣muniariorum Ciuitatis praedictae de Communi Concilio eiusdem Ciuitatis existentium. FOrasmuch as diuers parcels of Plate of her Maiesties, and of other persons of honor and credite, haue of late yeares beene stolne, and her Highnesse Armes or honorable Eschochions, and the Es∣chochions of others, owners, therevppon being engrauen, haue beene defaced and blemished: and many Iewels, Chaines, and Bracelets, and such like thinges of Golde and Pearle, haue beene imbezelled from diuers honorable persons and others. And for that within this Cittie and the Li∣berties of the same, there be very many Burgularies, Robberies, and Fellonies, dayly committed and done, many vile and notable Coozenages and deceites practised and put in vre, and many hou∣ses also infected with the Plague, by reason that diuers persons, called Retayling Broggers, Brokers or Hucksters, and others, such as vse to buy olde Apparell, Householdstuffe, Bedding, Bookes, Endes, and Remnants of Silkes and Veluets, or of Lin∣nen and Wollen cloth, or such like, to sell agayne, inhabiting within the same Cittie and the Liberties thereof: vnder pretence of lawfull and iusticiable contracting, doe often, very secretely for vnhonest lucre, and that most ordinarily, vppon the Sabbaoth dayes, Festiuall dayes, and other Holy dayes, whereon no markets ought to bee kept, nor bargaines, contractes, or sales to bee made, receiue, buy, and take to pawne, at the handes of base, shifting, and suspected persons, for very low prices, or small soms of money, diuers Plate, Iewels, Goods, Wares, Merchandises, Apparell, Bookes, and Bedding, Remnantes and Endes of Silkes, Veluets, and of Linnen and Wollen cloth, and other such like thinges, whereof the greatest part are stolne, some part gotten from the owners by Coozenage and sleight, and some newly brought out of houses infected with the Plague, takinge thereof billes of sale. And the same doe presently sell againe, & transact sometimes to persons vnknowne, sometimes to French and Dutch Brokers, who secretely conuay and make transportation thereof beyond the Seas, so that the right proprietors and true owners, by coulour of such pretended sales and secrete transportation, are not onely frustrated and depriued of all ordinary meanes for recouery or restitution of their saide goods, but also the fellons and malefactors, are thereby for the most part encou∣raged and their offences cloaked and concealed.
