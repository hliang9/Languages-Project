THE CASE OF THE Children of Coll. John Burke, Commonly called Lord Bophin. THE said Collonel Burke's Six Sons are brought up in the Protestant Religion, the Two eldest of them are now at School in Eaton-College; and His Majesty being sensible how much their Education in the Protestant Re∣ligion would conduce to the Establishment of the Protestant Interest in Ireland, and how good a President it was, has hitherto ordered a Maintainance for them out of their Father's Forfeiture. NOW so it is, that the said Collonel Burke's Forfeited Estate is to be disposed of by the Bill relating to Irish Forfeitures, and as yet no Provision is therein made for the said Childrens Maintenance, but are left exposed to the utmost Want. IT is therefore humbly hoped, That the Ho∣nourable the House of Commons will so far Encou∣rage the Increase of the Protestant Religion, as to provide Bread for the Protestant Children of a Great and Noble Family out of their Father's Estate.
