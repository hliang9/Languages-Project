THe Kings most Excellent Maiesty, in His most religious care, and Princely consideration, of the Peace of this Church & Common wealth of England, and other his Dominions, whereof God of his goodnes hath, vnder his Sonne Christ Iesus, made him the supreame Gouernour, obseruing, that in all ages great disturbances, both to Church and State, haue ensued out of small beginnings, when the seedes of Contention were not timely preuented, and finding, that of late some Questions and Opinions seeme to haue been broched or raised in matters of Doctrine, and the Tenents of our Religion, which at first onely being meant against the Papists, but afterwards by the sharpe and indiscreete handling and main∣taining of some of either parts, haue giuen much offence to the sober and well grounded Rea∣ders, and Hearers of these late written Bookes on both sides, which may iustly be feared, will raise some hopes in the professed enemies of our Religion, the Romish Catholikes, that by de∣grees, the professours of our Religion may bee drawen first to Schisme, and after to plaine Popery. His Maiestie therefore, in the integrity of His owne heart, and singular prouidence of the peaceable gouernment of that people, which God hath committed to His charge, hath thought fit, by the aduice of His reuerend Bishops, to declare and publish, not onely to His owne people, but also to the whole world, His vtter dislike to all those, who to shew the subtilty of their wits, or to please their owne humours, or vent their owne passions, doe, or shall aduenture to stirre or moue any new Opinions, not only contrary, but differing from the sound and Ortho∣doxall grounds of the true Religion, sincerely professed, and happily established in the Church of England; And also to declare His full and constant resolution, that neither in matter of Doctrine, or Discipline of the Church, nor in the gouernment of the State, he will admit of the least innouation, but by Gods assistance will so guide the Scepter of these His Kingdomes and Dominions, by the Diuine prouidence put into his hand, as shall be for the comfort and assu∣rance of His sober, religious, and well affected Subiects, and for the repressing and seuere pu∣nishing of the insolencies of such, as out of any sinister respects, or disaffection to his Person or Gouernment, shall dare either in Church or State, to disturbe or disquiet the peace thereof.
