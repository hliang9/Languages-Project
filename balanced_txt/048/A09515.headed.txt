¶ The boke entytuled the next way to heuen the whi∣che in true walkȳge or goȳnge is but thre dayes Iour∣ney / and to go or walke euery daye but thre myles as wytnesseth moyses who sayeth. Ibimus viam trium dierum in solitudinem. &c. Exodi .iij. Ca. F.
WHan I beholde the estate & lyfe yt I haue ben of syns yt I coude knowe ye good & the yll I ne fynde but sȳnes & tyme loste and yf I ony good dedes haue done yet are they not dygne ne worthy of guerdon / for I them haue done so neclygently wtout loue & wtout aduyse. And it se∣meth me / & also I doubte me yt they all ne bē ony thȳge worth. Alas suche am I wherfore I doubte lest yt I be cut downe & cast in to ye fyre. That is to saye yt I be not after this present lyfe put vnto deth & cast in to ye fyre of hel wt yt deuilles & with my sȳnes. Alas I haue wasted of goodes & lost for to norysshe my caryon more than I haue wonne. Certes I am not worthy to be called man or woman / for I haue ledde a ryght foule lyfe & poore. And for as moche I haue shame to lyue / & also I dare not dye. Alas now sholde I wepe all the tyme of my lyf for to recouer the tyme that I haue lost. Alas body syn∣ner what thynkest thou / knowest thou not wel that one tyme it behoueth yt to dye / & also thou ne knowest whā ne how. Knowest thou not well yt ye Iudgement of god aprocheth / certes yes. O what anguysshe shall that be vnto the euyll parsones to se a daye full of derknesses of sorowes of trybulacyons / of cryenges / & brayenges of wepynges / and of waylynges / and of dredes of abasshe mentes of eclepses and of thonders / of tempest / and of yre / & of other grete & horryble thynges. O yt there shal be harde tydynges & bytter. O what heuynes / o what dolour / alas what thȳkest thou slepest thou / or wakest thou what abydest thou. Alas that thou arte on slepe whan thou tremblest not to here so grete thonder. Alas drye tree worthy to be cutte and put in the fyre / tell me
hast thou ony fruyte / ye mayst thou say moche y•ll and roten / for synne is bytter & stynkynge. Alas here is an euyll lyfe where as I haue lefte ye cōmaūde mentes of god and haue obayed vnto the cōmaūdementes of the worlde / not vnto ye worlde all onely / but vnto ye worlde vnto flesshe / & vnto the deuyll. God yt created vnto his ymage / and redemed and gouerned from day to daye. And promyseth to gyue vnto the his realme / & it is he without whome thou ne mayst lyue / and also thou hast done vnto hym so grete dyspleasure whā thou hast not dayned to obey vnto hym / but hast loued more derly to obey vnto the worlde / vnto the flesshe / and vnto the de∣uyll / A it is no lytell thynge how be it that it semeth vn to the so. Alas what shalte thou saye at ye daye of Iuge¦ment whan all ye tyme that thou hast lyued shall be de∣maunded how thou hast spent it. For it hath be lente ye for to employe in the seruyce of god thy creatoure. Alas wenest thou that it be now tyme to go to play to laugh to bourde to speke trifles / cextes nay / But it is tyme to playne and to wepe and to enchase & flee from synnes & to plante vertues / & to do good werkes. And after this lyfe it shall betyme to play / & that is in a fayre delecta∣ble place. Now proue I ye than that it behoueth to yeld accompte euery houre of euery momente of tyme syns that yu were borne tyll vnto thy depatynge. And there at ye Iudgement before god before ye vyrgyn Marye & aungelles / and all the saȳtes and before all the worlde And there shall be serched and demaūded all that / that thou haste done ayenst the wyll of god. And also vnto ye shal be shewed all the good dedes that yu hast lefte vndo ne the which thou sholdest haue done yf by penaunce it ne had be pardoned the. And that thou shalte be wel set The nexte waye to heuen.
aboute with synne / yf thou wepe them not now by con∣fessyon / contrycyon / & satysfaccyon. And than shalte yu reknowlege Iustyce & mercy and so shalte rest for than prayer / seruyce / promyse / force / gyftes excusacyons ne fayre speche / ne penaunce in no wyse maye helpe / ne no thynge ben of valoure / & than shall these synners se the Iuste Iudge out of mesure wroth & redy to do Iustice without mercy. And vnder shall they se the depe helles open to engloute them / & more than an hundred thou∣sande tourmentes the whiche be made redy vnto them And on theyr ryght hande they shall se all theyr synnes wherof they shall haue meruayllously grete hydour / & on the lefte hande they shal se these enemyes horryble & moche cruell in theyr terryble & hydeous fourme awy∣tynge that the sentēce of the Iudgement be yelded and cast vpon the synners to the ende that thy may drawe them with them in to hell. And also they shall se the tyre enflambed without forth. And also they shall fele theyr cōscyence brēne without forth. Alas yf thou be than of the nombre of synners what coūtenaūce shalte yu make were mayst yu hyde the / the whiche now ne mayest here the worde of god / certes in noo parte. But it behoueth the to appere wylte thou or not / & shalte abyde the dolo∣rous sentence. Alas what shalte yu than do / thou shalte than tremble / for now begyn our soules to tremble yet dyspayre the not / but retourne vnto hym the whiche yu hast wretchedly offended & pray hym humbly yt he wyl haue of the pyte and mercy / & that he wyl gyue the par¦don. And haue thou good hope in his mercy / & he shall receyue the with good wyll / for he receyueth gladly the synners whan they retourne towarde hym by ye waye of penaunce / ye whiche waye hath thre dayes Iourney
in lengthe / as ye may here here after in this present bo¦ke as sayth saynt Peter of Lucembourgh. SAynt Peter sayth that we ben all pylgrymes in this worlde here. And we walke day & nyght wt our restynge in to our countre the whiche is in heuen. And for to haue recreacyō as these pylgrymes the whi∣che speken with good wyl in walkynge theyr waye. Al∣so in goynge vnto our pylgrymage / that is paradyse / we shall speke alytell / for we walke strongly & we haue not but thre dayes Iourney to walke ye one of the sayd thre dayes Iourney is cōtrycyon / & the other cōfessyon the thyrde is satisfaccyon. And in lykewyse sayth Moy¦ses vnto vs. Ibimus viam triū dierū solitudine. The fyrst sholde be contrycyon / that dayes Iourney hathe thre leges or miles from thens to walke. The fyrst lege or myle is dolour of hert of that / that by his synne man hath deserued the gybet of hell. The secōde myle is cal∣led dolour of herte of that / that he hathe loste the grete Ioye of paradyse. The thyrde mile is dolour of herte & grete dyspleasaunce of that / that a man hath offended god. Certes these thre myles sholde be ryght anone go∣ne vnto a good walker or goer. Example / if a man were taken for ony euyl yt he hath done / as yf he had ben takē in his thefte & cōdempned vnto ye deth & men lede hym vnto the gybet / and that ye kynge mette hym & hym de∣maūded frende wheder do they lede the. And he answe∣reth. Syr they lede me to be hāged bycause I am a the¦fe. Also I haue well deserued it for the euylles yt I haue done. And the kynge answered vnto the thefe. I haue pyte of the / & yf thou wylte promyse me that thou shalt do no more so as yu hast done in tymes paste & that thou
be sory of that thou haste deserued to be hanged I shall delyuer the. I byleue that he sholde be ryght Ioyefull So sholde he be anone at the fyrste myle. And other ex∣ample how a man ouercomen amonge theues the whi¦che haue robbed hym of his goodes / and is lefte poore. And in that the kynge meteth hym & hym demaunded Frynde how is it with the. And he answereth ryght yll for I haue ben robbed and haue loste all my good. And the kynge say the vnto hym / frende be thou sory of that that thou hast lost thy goodes and I shall yelde it the & yet more he sholde be more gladde than before. That is to saye that ye synner sholde be sorowfull of that / that he hath lost paradyse by his synnes. Now may ye demaū de me & saye / ye saye that coutrycyon yeldeth agayn all the goodes. And I haue lost my vyrgynyte / how shall contrycyon yelde it me. Frende I answere the that yf yu haue lost two grotes or two nobles and yf Iyelde vnto the agayne syxe thou haste well recouered thy losse. Ex∣ample a maser of marbyt ye whiche is broken hath lost his beaute in his ancyente / but it may be in suche wyse made agayn that it shall be more dere than before by ye golde & the syluer wherwith it shall be anourned. And so I say the yt yf thou haue lost thy vyrgynyte the beau¦te of thy vyrgynyte ne may be recouered / but yu mayste so repayre it & aourne it by so noble vertues that it shal be better & more rycher than it was before. Example of Magdaleyne and of Marie egypcyen the which them anourned so well and of so noble vertues so rychely that they were more worthy after thā before. Be thou than sorowfull of that that thou hast lost thy vyrgynyte & ye goodes of grace & paradyse shal be yelded vnto the as it is sayde. And this is the sconde myle of this Iourney.
And other example / a clerke serued a bysshop ye whiche sholde gyue hym a benefyce / but ye sayd clerke lefte his seruyce of the bysshop / & yode to serue an other mayster and loste the loue of the bysshop. And than the bysshop sayd vnto the clerke / thou hast wrathed me / but yf thou wylte be sory thou shalte haue my loue as thou haddest before / & I shall gyue the the benefyce ye I haue promy¦sed to gyue the / sholde not he be anone sory of that I by leue that yes. And in lyke wyse is it yf thou wrath god by thy synne thou sholdest haue contricyon & make thy peas. And oure lorde shall gyue vnto the the realme of paradyse. And this is the thyrde myle of this Iourney & in ye ende of that here sholdest thou make thy gyste & rest the / but it suffyseth not to be sory of that / that thou hast euyll done and that thou hast deserued to be in hell ne of that / that thou haste lost paradyse / but for yt / that thou haste loste the loue of god thy good lorde. Example yf thou haste wrought with Peter and whan the euen tyde shall come thou goest vnto Iohn̄ to demaunde thy wages / & Iohn̄ shall answere the. My frende he with whome ye hast wrought shall paye the thy wages & not I. Hast thou not herde saye / who so set the to werke let hym paye the. And in lyke wise may god saye at ye deth of the man in Iudgement of hym / the which shall be re¦pentaūt onely for the drede of hell and for the loue of pa∣radyse to haue it all onely & shall say my frende go thou in to hell and take there thy rewarde for thou leftest not for to do the euell for the loue of me / but witout more for the drede of hell / where our lorde shall saye / speke vnto hell that he helpe the and socoure the / yf he may / for I am not holden to helpe the at thy nede for thou ne haste done the good dedes that thou haste done for the loue of
me / but yu hast done them for to haue paradyse all onely & for drede of hell / & so than yu sholdest doo ye good dedes for to gete the loue of god / and not for drede aboue all of thy dampnacyon. And so go thou the thre myle aboue sayed / & ye shall rest in ye ende of the thyrde. That is to saye that he shold be sory of that / that he hath deserued to haue hell and lost paradyse / but in especyal aboue all thynges sory of that / that he hath lost ye loue of god by his synne. A man sholde seke cōtrycyon entyerly so that he maye fynde it. And after to haue the loue of god his creatour. And not to do as dyd the man ye which abode to confesse hym tyll vnto the dethe / & than he cryed con∣trycyon contrycyon wheder are ye gone. And soo he ne myght fynde it & knowe yu that it was true Iustyce of god. For saynt Gregory sayth. It is good reason yt god forgyte hym or her at the deth / the which in his lyfe en helth forgyteth god & leueth. Repent we than in as mo¦che as we ben in good helth & in lyfe & god shall pardon vs wt good wyll / and it is the fyrst Iourney THe seconde Iourney of paradyse is confessyon. Fewe people can wel walke that Iourney with¦out goynge out of the waye / And it is no meruayle / for how maye he be a good clerke the whiche ne goeth / but one tyme in the yere to the scole / and yet ryght well ad∣uysed ne wt grete payne may he be a good werke man yt whiche hath his crafte. The good clerke ryseth vp for to studye by nyghte / and in lyke wyse sholde we doo for to lerne this scyence. And in lyke wyse dyde ye holy pro∣phete Dauyd as it is sayd in the psalter. Media necre surgebam. I arose vp sayd he at mydnyght for to con∣fesse my synnes / for to aduyse me whan I shall goo to
confesse me. That is ayenst those the whiche go to con∣fession without aduyse. The ryght entre of cōfessyon is I cōfesse me vnto god / vnto the vyrgyn Marye / & vnto al the sayntes of paradyse / & vnto you syr ye whiche are in goddes stede & vycayre. This fyrst worde I confesse me closeth hell vnto the synner & openeth vnto hym pa¦radyse ye whiche was shette vnto hym by his synne & so hath peas with god and shetteth the mouth of ye preest werof men rede vnto that purpose an example. A Ryche man fader of the curate of the towne spa∣ke vilany vnto a poore man / & the poore man ne myght venge hym presently / but taryed tyll that ye ry∣che man yode vnto ye feldes for to se his cornes al alone and the poreman ye whiche se hym come toke the coul∣tre of his ploughe & slewe the ryche man. And after he yode to lede his ploughe / & noo man wyst who it sholde be. Afterwarde a great whyle it hapned that the poore man had repentaunce of his mysdede & yode to confesse hym to his curate the whiche was yt sone of the sayd ry¦che man that he had slayne. And as he {con}fessed hym the curate apperceyued well that he had some synne in his conscyence that he durst not tell / wherfore he sayd to hȳ My frende hardely tel all thy synnes / for there is none so great but that god may well pardon after that a mā hym requyre mercy / & also in that ye I may I shall hel∣pe the & I shall pardon ye. And than sayd ye poore man, Ha syr I am the cursed man the whiche hath murdred your fader so by suche maner / & for that cause I cōfesse vnto god and vnto you syr in requyrynge pardon and absolucyon. Than the preest chaūged his blode for na∣ture / but he ne made no semblaunt and pardoned vnto
the good man with good herte the deth of his father / & after ward the curate shewed vnto the poore man grete token of loue more by halfe than he was wonte in so mo¦che yt his wyfe apperceyued it well / & so hym demaun∣ded by many tymes what it was to saye that ye curate cometh so often to se the / & that he vnto the sheweth soo great token of loue. And so oftentymes hym demaūded that he tolde her and compted ye trough wherin he dyd as a fole. Now it happened ye he was wrothe wyth his wyfe and wolde bete her. Than she escryed hym & lepte in to the myddes of the strete & sayd in cryenge out / out the thyfe the murdrer he wolde slee me as he hath done the fader of our curate. And than the chyldren & paren∣tes of ye deed man whan they herde that / that she had sayd they ranne all with pykes & swerdes for to slee the poore man. Whan he them apperceiued he lepte hastly vpon a mare yt he had & fledde. And in fleynge he mette the curate comȳge on horsbacke ye whiche came to war∣de the towne & sayd vnto hym / my fayre sone how is it with the / wheder goost thou so hastly / & the poore man tolde hym shortely ye cause wherfore he fledde. A sayd ye curate my frende come downe frome thy mare anone & lepe vpon my hors which goeth more swiftly to thende that thou mayst escape fro my parentes the whiche fo∣lowe the. Than the poore man lepte vpon the curates hors and fledde. And that hangynge his frendes came the whiche folowed the good man ye whiche sayd vnto hym. A fals traytoure you haue wel hyd the murdre of your father & he hath tolde it you in confessyon. A fayre lordes sayd the curate ye haue wronge who hath tolde you suche thinge I knowe no thȳge / but I knowe wel that he is one of the good and well dysposed mē of this
parysshē. And they answered velye / ye knowe it well / but ye haue euer more hydit vnto vs. And yet now hast thou taken vnto hym thy hors for to escape frome vs & from our handes / and also ye haue taken his mare the preest excused hym euermore and also excused the poore man / & so moche that they were wrothe with him in su¦che wyse that they slewe the sayd curate / & so ye se wyll by thys example how this worde I confesse me closeth the mouthe of the preest. Now ye shall here wherfore a man saith vnto god almyghty vnto the blessyd vyrgin Mary and vnto all sayntes. The reason is suche. Our lorde hathe two courtes / the one is of Iustice & ye other of mercy. And the deuyll dare not lay hande on the syn¦ner tyll vnto suche tyme that he be delyuerd vnto hym And the deuyll cometh vnto the courte of Iustyce for to accuse ye poore & myserable synner. And Iustyce answe¦reth. I byleue the not for thou arte a lier. Than answe¦reth the deuyll. I haue good wytnesses dygne of fayth & of credence without ony reprofe / that is to knowe all the trynyte of paradyse / the vyrgyn Marye & all ye ho∣ly sayntes / and his good aūgell before whome he hath done his synnes / but for me they ne wyll come hyder / wherfore call ye theym your selfe / & than whan Iustice calleth god / our lady / all the sayntes in wytnesse and ye good aūgell & foūde it is that it is so as the deuyll sayth yf ye haue not ynoughe of wytnesses I cal his owne cō¦scyence. And I you praye that ye cōiure hym yt he saye trouth / & than Iustice seeth by the counseyle of the syn∣ner that it is so. And so is it truely I ne can excuse me. Than sayth Iustyce vnto the synner syth that it is so ye god / our lady / the sayntes / & thy good aūgel with thyn owne conscyence haue of accorde that thou haste done
mortall synne / & that in this synne thou arte deed with out repentaunce thou sholdest be dampned perdurably for the wytnesse that the deuyll bryngeth forth by suffy¦cyent / & it behoueth that I cast sentēce of dampnacyon vpon the pardurably / for god sayth by ye prophete. Aīa¦que peccauerit ip̄a moriet̄. That is to saye / that ye soule the whiche hath synned shal dye & shall be dāpned. So I ne knowe what counseyle to gyue but onely to appel vnto the courte of mercy / & put the and al thy causes in her hande. Than the synner sholde appel vnto ye courte of mercy the whiche is in this prensent lyfe / & he sholde go hastly to confesse hym. And fyrst he ought to call the grace of god / for the enemy shall pursewe hym & theder shall sende .iiii. aduocates & shall make partye for to let this confessyon. And euery man ought to vnderstande in this wyse to cōfesse hym & in ye courte of mercy. The fyrst aduocate that the deuyll sendeth ayenst the synner that is cursed angre or displeasure to tel his synne / and shall saye in this wyse vnto ye synner. Tell thou not thy synne it sholde be grete shame vnto the / yf men knowe that yu haste done suche vylayn outrage & abhomyna∣ble / vnto the whiche aduocate ye synner sholde answere I shall tell it & dyscouer purely and makyngly & large∣ly without ony thynge hydynge for it is wryten who so couereth his synne god shall dyscouer hym at ye daye of Iudgemēt before ye enemyes / before the vycgyn mary and aungelles / & sayntes / & before all the worlde. And whā this aduocate shall be in suche wyse vaȳquysshed than shall come the other ye whiche hath to name ypo∣crysye & shall saye thus / tell it not vnto thy cōfessour for he weneth that thou be a good mā / & yf thou tell it hym he shall take his herte from ye / & he shal neuer set gretly
by the. Byleue not suche an aduocate / for it is fals / for knowe yu that all good confessours loue better ye synner or the synners after the confessyon than before / & for as moche as he confesseth hym of the more grete synnes & abhomynables of as moche loueth hym the better / as ye haue hyrde here aboue ye cōfessours be of the nature of aungelles / for as moch as the aungelles seen a more grete synner cōuerted of as moche make they the more grete Ioye in henen / as our lorde sayth by the euange∣lystes & also the confessours. Example by ye gospell the whiche speketh of one the whiche had an hōdred shepe wherof he had lost one he left the .iiij. score & .xix. & yode to seke that whiche was lost / & whan he had foūde hym he toke hym bytwene his armes & bare hym in to his hous sayenge vnto his frendes and neyghbours make Ioye wt me / for I had lost my shepe & now haue I foū∣de hȳ. Inlyke wyse it is of god whan he fyndeth agay∣ne the synner by true confessyon he maketh more grete Ioye & feest than he dyde of ye .iiij. score Iust. Yf yu wylte be than happy & well loued of thy confessour cōfesse the hardely & dyscouer thy synne playnly / purely / & clenly. And he shall comforte the & ayde the / & shal shewe more grete good of the than before. And whan yu haste vayn∣quysshed this aduocate ye deuyll theder sended the thyr de that is hope or trust of longe lyfe ye whiche shall saye My frende thou arte yet yonge / thou shalte confesse the tymely ynough. Unto whome thou sholdest answere I shall confesse me shortly / for I haue no surte of the mo∣rowe. And whan he shal be in suche wyse vaȳquysshed Than shall come the fourth aduocate yt is cursed drede to do grete penaunce / & shall saye in suche wyse / tell not thy syane for that / that it is to moche grete / yf thou tell
it he shall gyue the so grete penaūce that thou he mayst do it / so sholdest thou be worse than yu were before / vnto whome yu shalte answere. Salomon say the who so dre∣deth to do a lytell penaunce & to suffre he shall haue soo moche to do ye there is no tonge the whiche can tell it for it behoueth that the syn̄es be punisshed or elles where. Than tell all thy syn̄es / for yf yu hyde ony synnes by the counseyle of suche an aduocate thou lesest thy cause in ye courte of mercy / & yf yu tell all yu arte quyte / & to se the so quyte that god ne our lady ne ye sayntes whiche ben in paradyse / ne the deuyll that is in hell ne yet none other thynge shal neuer haue in mȳde ne haue remembraūce of thy mysdedes / so sayth god by the pyhete ysaye. Nō recordabo amplius iniq̄tatis sue. Than shall yt synner be well happy ye whiche dare tell his synne vnto a man mortal the whiche is a synner as he is whan in ye other worlde before all the courte of paradyse it shall be vnto hym in reproche yll aduysed shal he be ye whiche loueth better to be in horryble penaūce & torment in all tymes perpetually thā to be there one yere or two. or .v. or .viii. or x. or .xx. yf thou haddest woundes mortelles & thou ne sheweste but .xj. to the surgyon / the .xj. sholde be he∣led and the .xij. sholde be roten / and sholde make therin thende to dye. In lykewyse shall do ye syn̄e that yu leuest to tell & shall rote thy soule hydynge the thou shalte dye spyrtually by that poynt. Now haue ye hetde whefore men saye I confesse me vnto god / vnto the blessyd byr∣gyn marye / and vnto all the sayntes of paradyse / and vnto you syr. Now shall ye vnderstāde that this Iour∣ney hath thre myles as the other hath. The fyrste is yt the confessyon ought to be entyer as it is sayd without ony thȳge hydynge. The secōde yt it ought to be made
of good wyll without constraynte as Dauid saith. Vo∣luntarie sacrificabo tibi et cōfitebor. ¶ The thyrde is yt the synner haue a very fayth and a trust that god hym may pardon / for as saynt Austyn saith. God is more re¦dy to pardon vs than we ben to demaūded hym pardon And in thende of his mile the synner may rest hym and take hostell and not in the other two. That is to saye to rest in esparaūce to haue pardon & not to do as dyde Iu¦das ye whiche sayd I haue synned in betrayenge ye holy blode Innocent & Iuste. He {con}fessed hym voluntayrly & entyerly his mysdede & made satysfacyon for he yelded agayn the .xxx. pens. But he yode not by this later my∣le for he dispeired hym. And so dyde Cayn whiche sayd My synne is more greter than ye mercy of god. But he sholde haue sayd. My synne is moche grete / but yet is the mercy of god more greter / and tho he cryed to god for mercy & he abode the grete mercy of god and he had mercy and soo had Iudas. Now haue ye hyrde the se∣coude Iourney / now here ye the thyrde⁂⁂⁂ THe thyrde Iourney to walke in to paradise is sa¦tysfaccyon wtout ye whiche Iourney a man may not come thyder. This Iourney hath thre myles as ye other hath. The fyrst is to restore ye theft yt a man hath done / for saynt Austyn sayd yt the syn̄e is not pardoned tyll that the thefte be restored. Nō dimitter̄ petm̄ nisi re¦stituatur ablatū. Who so than taketh from an other hȳ behoueth to yelde it / and also who soo taketh from god ony good soule & withdraweth it by synne or by his yll example it behoueth hym to yelde it and to restore it. Or who so taketh frome ony his renome / & areyseth yll grace it behoueth to restore hym vnto his good renome
Now may some saye. I am yōge & I ám ledde by coyn¦tyse wantonesse as moche as I may / & I haue shende my selfe in the chyrche & in many other stedes & places before men / & women so moche that many hath synned by my folysshe coūtenaunce / werof I haue be culpable by many an yll example or by my draught how may I with drawe them from synne / for I ne knowe them all And also yf I sholde retourne towardes them parauen¦ture they sholde be enflambed in suche maner yt I shold retourne vnto synne or that themselfe there myght fall agayne more strongely. And therfore me semeth that it sholde be grete peryll to retourne towardes them / and what shall I there doo than / ye sholde take from synne those or them yt ye haue made to synne / that is ye moost sure & best / but yf ye may not put you in payne to with drawe other / & to yelde them vnto god for to put them in the place of those that thou hast taken from hym / so shalte yu appease him. For yf ye haue taken from a man fyue shyllynges / it is not of necessyte that I yelde vnto hym agayne ye selfe fyue shyllynges yf I ne may fynde it / but it behoueth yt ye yelde vnto hym other fyue shyl∣lynges. And for as moche as thou knowest not how ma¦ny people thou haste drawen vnto synne / therfore thou sholdest put the in payne by good examples & by good doctrynes to retracte & withdrawe as many people as thou hast made to synne / yf thou ne mayst mo conuerte vnto god & elles yf thou ne mayste conuerte the people by wordes or examples at the leest praye for them often in goodnes. Example yf a kynge made a noble dyner & made to crye ouer all that who so sholde haue & brynge the gretest company shold be best welcome & also sholde haue ye moost fayrest gyfte / euery man sholde paye him
to come to dyner & to brynge the moost of people of his cōpany yt he myght for to haue of ye kynge ye moost fay∣rest gyfte. And in lyke wyse is it of god for our lord hath made a crye ouer all the worlde by his messengers that be the apostles / the prophetes / & the doctours / & by the predycacyons that he ye whiche shall brynge the ye most fayrest cōpany vnto dyner that is to knowe moost sou∣les vnto paradyse by his examples & doctryne he shall be moost best beloued & vnto whome god shall do moost grete honour. And also in so doynge yu shalte do honour vnto god yf thou payne the so to do & praye often god in sayenge. ¶ Syr / or lorde wylte thou by thy grace enlu∣myn my herte & myn vnderstādȳge yt I may haue eue¦ry day remēbraūce of thy passyon & gyue me knowlege in what maner I may lyue for to drawe mooste soules vnto the. And also that I may lyue vnto thy praysȳge by ye whiche it maye be vnto the saluacyon of my soule and of many other. Also who so hath wretched an other it behoueth to appease hym / & to crye hym mercy & to aske pardon / and also thou sholdest restore the good re∣nome & good fame vnto hym to whome thou hast done yll by thy cursed speche. And yf it were so that ony had taken ony goodes temporall by ony cursednes the whi¦che worldly goodes & temporal ye worlde gyueth better and by more stronger reason the good spyrytuall ye god gyueth they sholde well better by restored And yu mayst demaunde how a man maye that restore. Where that a man ne may one worde brought forth drawe backe but that it abydethe spoke. I graunte me vnto that / but yu ne shalte neuer be quite tyll vnto that / that with all thy puyssaunce in all maners that thou cannest and mayst thou hym haste restored / and that thou hast sayd vnto
all those & vnto all them the whiche by the cause hathe synned or shall synne in yt thynge saye yt thou hast lyed / & that thou hast made them so to byleue. And for those thou ne knowest ye whiche it may byleue thou arte hol∣den in the chyrches to pronounce it in sayenge that the wordes that thou hast sayd vpon suche a person be not true / and that thou ne knowest neuer ne yet sawest but good in hym and that cursedly thou haste pronounced it ayenst hym / and that it ne was but for to blame hym and soo shalte thou haue the fyrste lege or myle. The se∣conde myle is to wepe and to complayne his synnes / or to do almysdede or penaunce / or other good dedes for to haue pardon & soueraynly for the loue of god. And that ought to be done by ye counseyle of his good confessour. And the thyrde myle is to pardon vnto those the whi∣che hath yll sayd vnto you or mysoone. Now may some saye how maye I pardon hym ye whiche hath done me domage & without cause & reason. And yet also they ha¦ue mocked me before the stretes / & yet I ne dyde neuer dyspleasure vnto them. Example yf there were aman that ought vnto the kynge a thousande pounde / & the kynge helde hym in pryson & sayd vnto hym / yf yu paye me not thou shalt be hanged / and he had not wherof to pay. And yf ye kynge wolde saye vnto hym suche a man there is that oweth the .v. shelynges / & I shall gyue to the that thou oweste me & I shall let ye go quyte & thou shalte be my ryght welbeloued / & yf thou do it not thou shalte paye me yt thou oweste me / or I shall make the to be hanged wtout remedy / sholdest anone do it I byleue that yes. And yf he dyd it not men wolde saye yt he were a foole. In lyke wyse is hit spyritually to speke / we ben gretly indetted ayenst the grete kynge that is vnto god
And it behoueth that we payē vnto hym that that we owe hym / or we shall be hanged on ye gybet of hell / but yf the kynge wyll do vnto vs grace sayenge pardon all that yt men hathe mysdone vnto you / certes we therto sholde well accorde for we haue a hundred thousande ty¦mes more mysdone vnto god than man hath done vn∣to vs. And therfore shold we with ryght good wyll par∣don & so haue ye herde ye thre Iourneys the whiche it behoueth to haue to entre in to paradyse whā ye synner hathe so moche done by the grace of god yt is that he be in the estate of grace than sholde he kepe hym aboue all thinges to fall agayne & to thende yt he maye the better kepe hym he sholde take in hym a maner of lyuȳge how he wyll lyue / & also to absteyne hym from synne / in lyke wyse as he maye wel knowe that whan he doeth synne yt it displeaseth god. And so he pleaseth ye deuyll ye whi∣che is a grete folye. And fyrste thou shalte praye for the chyrche & for all the prelates of the chyrche & for all pryn¦ces of the erth / & for all the people ye whiche is cōmytte vnto hym. Afterwarde yu shalte praye for all those vnto whome thou arte holden. And after for al creatures the which ben in trybulacyon soueraynly for those that ben departed and deed vnto whome we ben holden / & thou sholdeste thynke on the euylles of thy selfe. And on the glorye that thou woldest haue / and on the paynes that thou hast deserued. And after on the houre of dethe and on the houre of Iudgment. And go often vnto the chyr¦che and with good wyll / as soone as thou arte in ye chyr¦che beholde ye ymage of Iesu chryst where he is crucy∣fied / and after take holy water / and knele on thy knees and begyn to saye. Veni creator spiritus mētes tuorū / or Pater noster / and after take thy sete in the chyrche
the moost pryuy place that thou mayst. And after thou shalte say pryme / houres / and the letany / in sayenge yt for gete not the passyon of thy creatoure in sayenge thy houres / & at euery masse that thou herest saye thy con∣fiteor softely & all the tymes that it shall be feest cōmaū∣ded thou shalte be at the hye masse & at the euensonge and yu sholdest cōmaunde the vnto the saynt of whome the feest shall be / & the remenaunt of ye feest employed in good werkes spyrytuall. And yu wylte cōfesse the cōfesse the vnto a confessour the whiche hath scyence & that he be a man of good conscyence / for yf he hath thought on his owne soule he shall haue thought of thyn / & yf he be suche as I tell ye obey vnto hym in all goodnes as vnto the vycare of god be thou not ydle at no tyme ne yet ar∣rest ye before thy dore in ye strete ne yet in thy windowe / be thou more often alone than in company. And as vn∣to fastynge made by good dyscrecyon yu shalte knowe yt it is moche good & that wtout discrecyon it is nothynge worth vnto hym the whiche fasteth / ne yet almesdede without dyscrecyon is noo thynge worthe. And in lyke wyse as a lampe wtout oyle ne may haue lyght / euen so is fastynge & almesdede wtout dyscrecyon / & thou shol∣dest knowe that the substaūce that yu drawest in to thy body thou oughtest to gyue it for the loue of god vnto ye poore / and with that it behoueth to eschewe fro synne / or that sholde be the fast of the deuyll the whiche alway fasteth & euermore doeth yll thou ne shalte ete but two tymes on the daye yf thou be not seke / & ete thou neuer tyll that thou hast sayd benedicite before / and after gra¦ces / and speke but lytell at thy dyner yf it be not of god yf thou speke there ydle wordes than repente the. And speke yu neuer wordes of an other that thou woldest not
that a man sholde speke of the. Thou sholdest speke at thy dyner or thynke of som good thynge to thende that thy soule maye fede as wel as thy body / & whan yu hast sayd graces thou shalte goo into thy chambre & there yu shalte saye noon. And afterwarde yu shalte studye some good mater or exāple / speke as lytell as yu mayst in ony place where so yu be for a man ne may lytell speke wtout synne. Go in to the towne as lytell as thou mayst. And whan thou haste there to do / & yf men areson the speke in brefe & humbly and retourne in to thy hous as soone as thou mayst / ete but litel oute of thy hous be thou py¦teous vpon ye poore people yf thou wylte that god take the in good gree & that he haue pyte on ye gyue often for the loue of god after thy power yt thou haste. Yf yu haue ony thynge to do whiche toucheth the do it by the coun¦seyle of a good persone. And also thinke that y• ne mayst nothynge hyd from god ne kepe / but that he seeth all yt thou shalte do and saye. Ordeyne so well thy conscience that whā thou shalte be seke that yu ne hast no cause but for to thynke on thy creatour. And towarde ye euentyde thou shalte saye euensonge & vygylles of ye deed yf thou can them & passe not the daye but that thou thynke one tyme of the daye on thy cōscyence in recordynge thy syn¦nes for to holde the in humylite & thou shalte knele and salewe the holy trynyte / & thou shalte say at ye leest thre tymes the pater noster / & after salue ye vyrgyn Marye and recōmaunde the vnto god & vnto ye virgyn Marye and make some good prayer vnto thy good aūgell that he be thoughtfull to kepe ye / & after blesse the & take ho∣ly water & laye the downe & slepe in some good thought Be thou often in orayson be it of mouth or of herte saye thynges brennynge to haue deuocyon. Thre thynges
there ben the whiche ayedethe to haue deuocyon. The fyrste is puryte of conscyence / in lykewyse yt whan ony wolde pray a grete lorde he sholde take hede yt whan he cometh before hym ye nothynge appere vnto hym that shall dysplease ye lord. And so is it who so wyl go in oray¦son he ought to eschewe yt he ne haue ony spotte of syn̄e in hym ye whiche sholde dysplease vnto god the whiche seeth the hertes of all the other. Than saynt Bernarde sayth yt all the tymes that we go in orayson we entre in to the courte of heuen in the whiche ye kynge of glory is. Also aourned wt mayny aūgelles of princes celestyalles and of the gloryus quene of heuen. So we sholde appe∣re in grete reuerence & in grete fere & in grete humilyte and in grete puryte & in grete clēnes of herte / to thende that nothynge appere in vs that sholde dysplease vnto so grete a lorde as vnto god / for saynt Iohan sayth that whan thou makeste orayson make that yu be suche as yu ought to be ye whiche hath to speke wt god / purge than thy consyence of all thynges vnto thy power & meke ye / & afterwarde make vnto god request or elles yu shalt not be exalted. The seconde is yt he oughte to seke a place se¦crete yt he ne be seene to thende yt he ne be troubled. And that the wynde of vayne glory ne take frō him ye fruyte of his orayson. Example we haue in Iesu chyrst ye whi∣che enlonged hym & wente ferre frō his dyscyples whā he wolde praye in the gardyn of olyuete / & moyses the whiche assended in to the moūtayne. And also ye aūgell foūde Marye alone whan he saluted her / & saynt Fraū∣cys had of custome yt whan he wolde praye god he yode serre of in to a wood that his felowes ne myght here hȳ And of that haue we an example of oure selfe / yf a man hath to speke with an other he speketh vnto hym more
gladly whan he fyndeth hymselfe all alone. The thyrde thynge is yt he sholde at yt houre cast out of his herte all dremes & thoughtes & afterwarde to be all in orayson. The .iiij. thynge yt he oughte to haue with all his herte grete entende to praye ye holy ghost that he gyue vnto hym grace of deuocyon / for orayson without deuocyon hath no sauour / put than payne to houe it do that / that in ye is & god shall ende it. And yf god gyue the grace for to worsshyp hym menynge the payne that yu there shalt take wepe / for teeres ben as ryght good wyne of ye whi∣che ye soule deuoute wexeth dronke vnto god in orayson in suche maner yt he ne can refuse hym in that thynge yt he demaūdeth / in lykewyse as it appereth by saynt Pe¦ter / and by magdaleyn ye which wepte & god gaue vnto them that yt they demaūded that was pardon of theyr synnes. Teres ben of ryght grete profyte and of ryght grete v{er}tue / for one only tere maye gete of god that that all the aūgelles in heuen ne all ye saintes of paradyse ne may do that is to knowe whan ye synner wepeth for his propre synnes wherof it is wryten in the psalter that ye moost pleasaūt sacyfyce that ye synner may make vnto god is that he be contryte & repentaūte & that he hūble hym before god in wepynge / for whan ye tere of the syn∣ner repentaunt is offred vnto god wt humble herte & de¦uoute it thrughe perceth ye heuen by her vertue & moū∣teth tyl vnto the throne of the mageste dyuyne / & there ne is aungell the whiche it may ne dare holde tyll vnto that that it be come before the face of god / & that it hath goten that that he wyl for his soules helth / for the oray¦son the whiche is made in wepynge as sayth saynt Au∣styn thrughe perseth the herte of our lorde Iesu cryst & moueth him vnto pyty & entreateth & enclyneth to loue
hym & chaungeth ye sentence of Iudge & recordeth the synner perfytely vnto god. The .vj. is that he ought to regarde the estate of this presēt mysery where there is soo many perelles that there is none ye whiche maye it accompte / for man is euermore in temptacyon of ye fle∣she of worldly vanitees / and of the begylynge of of thyn enemy / other in stepinge or in wakynge / or in spekynge But he sholde thynke yt the worlde & the flesshe ne vayn quysshe but theyr frendes / & therfore sholde he wel kepe hym that he ne be frende of the worlde ne of the flesshe / for all those yt loue the worlde and the flesshe ben the ene¦myes of god as sayth saȳt Iames. Meruayle it is how the worlde may be Ioyous who so well regardeth ye pe∣ryll of this worlde / for the worlde is a Iayle wherin we ben in pryson for our synnes / & we ne knowe whan we shall goo out of it wheder we shall be saued or dampned Now sholde it be agrete nouelte yf the these sholde syn∣ge or laughe whan men lede hym to be hanged / but yet ben we well more out of wycte and more abused than su¦che theues for we renne all vnto the gybet of hell & vnto dampnacyon perdurable all daunsynge and makynge feest / for we ben in lyke wyse as a vessel in the hye see wt all the sayle stretched & hysed with wynde at wyll & we go euery daye on grete Iourneys to warde hell or para¦dyse / for we ne knowe yet in what parte we shall aryue & so all in slepynge / in walkynge / in drynkynge / in etyn¦ge in playenge / & in singynge euermore we goo for war¦de wtout arestynge as people the whiche ben of the see. And therfore who soo well beholdeth this worlde & the grete peryll he sholde haue better cause to wepe than to laughe / for yf the synner beholde the heuen he seeth the coūtree & herytage eternal where as is perfyte felycyte
from ye whiche he is yet ferre of by his synnes. And for as moche he hath good cause to wepe. And yf he behol∣de the erthe he seeth ye mater wherof he hathe be made and where vnto he shall retourne at the houre whan he shall departe from this worlde / that is in thende of this lyfe. And yf he loke vnder ye erthe he seeth hel ye whiche is redy to engloute hym with mouthe open / and to tour ment for his synnes. And yf he loke on the ryght hande he seeth the prosperitees & the rychesses wherof all the worlde it is abused & deceyued & drawne vnto dampna eyon. And yf he loke on the lyfte hāde he seeth the ylles & trybulacyons that ye cursed done vnto the good. And yf he loke behynde him he seeth the tyme yt he hath lost in vanytees & in thoughtes that he sholde haue dispen∣ded in good werkes. And yf he loke before hym he seeth the deth whiche cometh / & yet ne knoweth whā he shall dye / ne of what deth / ne in what place / ne ī what estate. And yf he loke within hym he seeth his cōscyence ful of synnes / & his wytte & his body full of cursed maners / & enclyned in cursed customes. And yf he loke wtout hym he fyndeth hymselfe enuyroned & beset aboute with soo many perylles / & ne knoweth how he shall escape. And also he seeth & knoweth the dure & harde sentēce of the ryghtfull Iudge yt he shall also caste at ye daye of Iud∣gement vpon ye synners of ye whiche he is one of ye nom∣bre yf he amende not his conscyence. We sholde put our ende in teres & in penaūce / & we sholde call ye holy ghost in oraysons that he be vnto vs in ayde & that he defend vs frō all our syn̄es & from all our myseryes. The .vij. thynge is to regarde the estate wherin he shal be at the deth whan all our membres haue loste all theyr force & strength / & the soule goynge forth frome the body shall
se our lorde out of measure wroth with hym for his syn∣nes / yf he ne be than truely penytent & repentaūt of all his defautes / & vnder he shal se hel open for to engloute hym / & his sȳnes he shall se on his ryght hande yt whi∣che shall accuse hym & the enemies on the lefte hande yt which wolde bere hȳ awaye & horryble shall crye vpon hym. Thȳke than often on these thynges & wtout ende and I knowe well yf thou vnderstode them that yu shol¦dest despyse lyghtly all ye vanytees of the worlde & shall drawe yt vnto deuocyon / for the vanytees wordely shall more greue at the deth than ne do ayde & than there no ne maye ayde ne socour / ne frendes / ne parentes / ne fa∣der / ne moder / ne almesdede / ne penaunce / ne prayer of saynt holy man or holy woman / ne good dede what soo euer he be / ne other thynge yf he be taken in synne mor∣call / than euery man ought well to praye god yt he wyll gyue hym grace to leue well & to doo well to put therto payne for good lyfe ledeth to good ende. And saynt Au∣styn saych / who soo hath well lyued ne shall not dye yll. The .viij. thynge is yt he ought to regarde & to recorde the grete humylyte and pacyence & the passyon of Iesu chyrst yt he had in erth for to gyue vs example / for all be it yt he were lorde of heuen & of ye erthe / yet wolde he be borne for vs of a woman & wolde be poore & deiecte & to sustayne so many persecucyons and payne that a man ne can nombre it / & after yt houre that he was borne tyl vnto ye houre that he dyed on the crosse he ne wolde ha∣ue no rychesse / ne none honour / ne ony delyte / but euer more had payne trauayle & pouerte. And ī yt he gyueth vnto vs coūseyle that he whiche wyll go vnto god shol∣de more loue in this worlde tribulacyon than delyte—for delytes nourysshen the vyces & ledde the soule in to hell
And therfore a man sholde desyre for to be hated of the worlde / for our lorde sayth / ye shal be well happy whan the worlde shall hate you & curse you & shall repute you for nothynge. And whan ye daye of Iudgement shal co∣me he shall say vnto those ye whiche in suche wyse hath be mocked in the worlde / ye be those the whiche were wt me in the worlde in these temptacyons & therfore come ye with me / for your rewarde is grete in heuen. Praye we than god that he gyue vs & sende vs tribulacy on in this worlde & gyue puyssaūce to bere it. The .ix. is that he ought to regarde how Iesu christ dyed for vs shame fully and with grete confessyon / & how he was for vs be ten / spytte on / bounde / mocked / and crowned with thor¦nes the whiche entred in hym vnto the brayne. And so in all his passyon to recorde that he vnto vs shewed mo¦re greter pacyence / ne more greter loue / ne myght noo man shewe vnto his frende than to wyll dye for hym / wherof saynt Bernarde sayeth. Yf my herte were a see of teres & myn eyne fountaynes & all my heres stremes & all ranne wtout ceasynge as a ryuer / ne neuer ceased ne fayled / yet ne myght I suffycyently wepe ye passyon of our lorde Iesu chryst that he suffred for me. The ten thynge is that he ougte to fasten his herte and ye eyen of his vnderstandynge to beholde ye Ioyes yt god hath apparayled vnto those the whiche loue him & he ought to haue in cōtemplacyon the blessed & gloryous virgyn Marye quene of all the worlde enuyroned & set aboute withe aungelles / & wt archaūgelles wt her noble couent of virgyns all clothed & anourned so rychely & so nobly that herte ne maye thynke partye of the leest beaute of her vyrgyns. And there ben the prophetes / ye apostles / the martyrs / and the confessours the whiche shal be all
as kynges & prynces & gretelordes and after the other sayntes wtout nombre. O how that they shall be ryche∣ly beseen. And that it shall be grete gladnes & Ioy to se the kȳge and his cōpany. But what shal it be to se after warde ye kynge his mayntayn & his estate whose beaute is so grete ye all the enhabytauntes of heuen ne maye neuer ynough meruayle ne them fulfyll to beholde hȳ. Saynt Bernarde sayth that the beaute of ye kynges & the beaute of the noble heuen is so grete that yf a man were assured to lyue in this worlde here a thousand ye∣res euermore yonge Ioyous in grete honour & in gre∣te rychesse & with that that he were assured to haue all ye delytes yt he can thȳke / yet sholde he put all those thȳ∣ges as nought for to se without more one onely hour of the leest Ioye or beaute that is in beuen. There is ye arber of delyces / there ben ye songes melodyous / there bē the louers varytable there ben the dysportes pleasaūt There is all that herte may remembre for persone to re¦ioyce. There is glory perpetuall wtout honger & with∣out amenysshemēt. Make we vs redy than hastely for to go thyder. Ryght dere bretherne & systers aboue all thȳges / regarde wel yourselfe / regarde what ye lately haue be / & what ye shal be after your deth from whens ye come & wheder ye go and where ye be. Thynke you what it is of a man or a woman after the deth / for it is but a caryon stynkynge and foule and mete vnto wor∣mes. Thynke often that ye ne be but a poore worme all naked goynge forth of the erth and that vnto erth it be houeth you to retourne. Remembre you frome daye to daye / or from one houre vnto an other in peryll to descē de & to fall into hell for our synnes ye go vnto the dethe and vnto Iudgement as at an houre. Remembre yt ye
haue be sent in to the worlde & thynke & remembre you wherfore and what ye there sholde do & where ye shall go to lodge the fyrst nyght after that we shall be depar∣ted from this worlde / for ye shall go into paradyse in to purgatory / or in to hell. And yf ye goo in to paradyse ye shall be ashamed yfye be not as well anourned with vertues as those that ye shall there fynde. And yfye go in to purgatory charged with syn̄es ye shall suffre the∣re payne ryght horryble. And yfye go in to hell ye shall haue there shame & payne perpetuall horryble & mer∣uayllous more than man ne may speke. Be ye than ad∣uyled & certayn that ye shall dye / and more sooner than is ne thynke or wene. The dayes of man be shorte & also passe sodeynly as the shadowe. Be ye certayne that all that ye founde in the worlde it behoueth you to leue ry∣chesses / honoures / delytes we ne shall bere noo thynge from hens / but our good dedes and our yll. And in lyke wyse as those the whiche leue now ben so hath those ly∣ued the whiche ben deed. And in lyke wyse as those the which ben deed were wonte to lyue / so shall those dye ye whiche now lyue. Loke well vpon this thynge and ha∣ue yourselfe in a wayete / for ye ne knowe the houre of ye dethe. Lerne to be humble and debonayre. And bere all tribulacyons & aduersytees swetely and in pacience for the loue of god the whiche so moche hath borne for you. And eschewe ye worlde as moche as ye may in all thyn∣ges worldely / serue ye those the whiche serue god / and haue ye none affyaūce in those the whiche take gladly of an other & the whiche receyue with good wyll gyftes for gyftes blynde the wyse wen / but haue affyaunce in hȳ in whome is loyalte for in all maner seke your helth Be he with good wyll in the company of those the whi∣che
loue god so ye shall parte with your good dedes / but kepe you from the hauynge of to moche grete familya∣ryte with man or womā all be it that he be good or that it semeth vnto you that he be good / for many in suche wyse hathe ben deceyued do ye well vnto the poore spe∣cyally vnto those the whiche loue god / lerne the cōmaū dementes of god and breke them not for no thynge that maye be. Be you euer a true sayer & verytable and lye thou not for no thȳge that may come therof / yfye haue to suffre for to speke veryte your rewarde shall be more grete in heuen. And yu shalte gyue vnto all people good example. Here euery daye masse yfye maye / be ye often in orayson / and more of herte than of mouth / brefe oray¦sons perseth ye heuen / so that it be sayd with good herte ne praye thou thynge the which is not necessarye vnto body or vnto soule. Drawe all personnes vnto good by good doctryne / thynke often on ye passion of Iesu chryst and desyre to suffre for the loue of hym / in lyke wyse as he hath suffred for vs / flee the temptacyons that ye ne may goodly vaynquysshe or ouercome. Be you sobre in drȳkynge & in etynge that is the helthe of the body and the welfare of the soule / seke euermore the peas of god / yf al ye worlde sholde be worth / for a man ne may please god and the worlde togyther / and yf ye fall out of good purpose goo hastly vnto confessyon / what thynge that ye se or here tourne all vnto the best / and yf your enten∣cyon come to effecte thynke that god doeth it to assaye you / or the enemy for to tempte you and for to deceyue you / yf you holde you wel ye shall do vnto god pleasure and yf ye fall yet aryse agayne by cōfessyon as soone as ye may in humblynge you / and purposynge to amende you au other time / yf the temptacyou come agayne vn∣to
you and that ye haue the vyctory loue ye and prayse ye god / and bere ye amyable that the yll that men hath donne vnto you or spoken. Repreue all ylnes that men speke vnto you or do by good maner without wrathyn∣ge you. Be ye contrarye vnto those the whiche ben con∣trarye vnto god and vnto reason / and vnto all good ve∣ryte / loue you that god loueth / & flee that thynge that god hateth / haue ye peas with all persones / and syke in all thynges ye loue of god / purchase vertues in doyn∣ge good werkes to thende that ye may come vnto ye glo∣rye perdurable⁂ AMEN. ¶ Here endeth the boke of saynt Peter of Lucēbourth other wyse named the nexte waye to heuen.
