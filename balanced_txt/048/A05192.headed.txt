A SERMON PREACHED BE∣FORE THE KINGS MAIESTIE at White-Hall, Feb. 7. MDCXXXVI. EXODVS III. V. And he said, Draw not nigh hither, put off thy shooes from off thy feet, for the place where∣on thou standest is holy ground. MY Text is Mandatum reverendi locum, quia sanctus est, saith CajetanCajet. in loc. Di∣onysius Carthus. Cornelà ap. Ru∣pert. Hug. Vict. Tostat.: A man∣date enjoyning a reverentiall distance unto the place, where typically God the Sonne was represented, where literally God Himselfe was present; either in his owne Per∣son, or by the mediation of an Angell: Holinesse becommeth thy house for ever, saith DavidPsal. 93.5.: so
doth reverence, and lowlinesse too, keep thy foot there∣fore, when thou goest to the house of God, saith Salo∣monEcles. 5..: for surely the Lord is in this place, though I knew it not, saith IacobGen. 28.16.. God came indeed to him in a dreame but if we dreame while we are here, he will not come so to us. O let us come, saith the ProphetPsal 9.6., but let us fall downe too: he commands our faith, but loaths our incivility, and loves neither a distrustfull servant, nor a sawcy one. He is here indeed, and be not too ventrous, lest thou feel him: Draw not nigh hither, put off thy shooes, &c. Where you may observe, First, a distinction in consecrated places: some consecrated to such a height, some not consecrated so high; the presence of the Lord in all, but not the same degrees of his presence in all: for, although one be ho∣ly and the other, one is not so holy as the other. Put off thy shooes where thou art (this being an outward Ceremony of ordinary use in their devotions, through those Eastern parts, whereby they testified the inward humiliation of the mind: commanded IoshuahIosh. 5.15. in expresse terms elswhere, and Moses here; and by the rules of equipollency, according to that exposition of the RabbinsPet.

Graeci ficuli discal∣cati ad sacra com∣meabant. and others tell us they used it) derived to the Gentiles: for why should any slave be more vile in the sight of his lord, than we in the presence of our God?) 'tis holy there: but come not hither though thy shooes be off, 'tis holier here: the greatest re∣spects thou canst give, are little enough for the place where thou art; and too little for the place where I
the am: thou maist not tread on that ground with thy shooes on, nor on this though thy shooes be of. econdly, The reason of this distinction: no inhe∣rem essentiall preeminence, flowing from the nature and position of the place; but a relativePer solutionem cal∣ceamenti demonstrat sancti praesentiā. Pro∣cop. in Exod. 3. Solve calceamen∣ta propter loci san∣ctitatem & Dei, sed unde terra illa sancta? quia de∣putata ad apparitio∣nem illam, & my∣sterium, & collo∣cutionem sanctam, & dationem legis.

Sanctified by the presence, and apparition of God. Ainsw. in loc. The meaning of that ce∣remony, Exod 3.5. Ios. 5.15. was to shew reverence to the place where God did manifest his presence. Mason of Fast. c. 3. accidentall preminence, arising from a peculiar dispensation of his esidence, and graces in the place. GOD was by his power and presence where Moses was, and he spake to him there; delivering his Commission in tis Chapter, arming him with miracles to speed it in the next: and this was enough to supererogate a greater reverence to this place than another, be∣cause GOD was more present in this place than in another: thy shooes might become that, thy bare feet best suit with this; and yet draw not too nigh the bush for all that; for even this deportment is not low enough to come thither, because that infnitude is more presentiall there. The Son of God was here in an allegory: for ignis in rubo Deus in car∣ne, say some of the Fathers: the fire in the bush is God in the flesh: and ignis in rubo Deus in Virgine, the fire in the bush is God in the VirgineBern. Serm. de beat. Mar. in illud Apocal. 12. Signum magnum apparuit. Theodoret. Nyssen. Orat. De Christi Nativitate., say others. And the Son of God was here without an allegory, either in his owne person according to many of the ancient: I am come downe to deliver them, saith this apparition at the eighth Verse: and none of the Persons came downe for our spirituall deliverance, whereof this temporall redemption of Israel out of Egypt was a Type, but he: or by the deputation of an Angell,Greg moral. l. 28. c. 2. &c. as the most.

An∣gell in one verse of this Chapter, in all the rest; the LORD; to shew, that, if this were not that Angell of the covenant in the Prophet, yet was it at least au∣ctoritate Deus, though obsequio Angelus, as the Iesu∣iteExod. 3.2. An Angell and the Lord, &c. v. 1.4, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 18. An Angell, Act. 7.30, 53. speakes; in the person of an Angell, the repre∣sentation of GOD. Approximation and neernesse was permitted there, remotenesse and distances re∣quired here. He might use adoration in that place, he must only use it towards this, because God was there more than ordinary, hee will have more re∣spects than ordinary: thy shooes are too uncleane for that place, thy bare feet not cleane enough for this. Thirdly, the illation upon this reason: A propor∣tionable adoration to those different degrees of conse∣cration: either in respect of the body, from the lite∣rall sense: adoration in conjunction, with that place, in it; put off thy shooes there: Adoration in opposition to the other place, towards it; come not nigh here.

the place where I am; and joyne thy heart with thy knee too; be that which thou doest, the messenger of what thou meanest; nor let thy body adore me, but in the company of thy minde, joyne soule and body in this Humiliation: 'tis holy where thou hearest me speake: but 'tis holyer from whence I speake; that is too cleane for thy Shooes, and this for thy feet. These are the measures of your patience, and this time: for the better spending whereof, that ho∣ly God, to whom all consecrated places are hallow∣ed, instruct me rightly to put the difference betwixt holy and prophane, the neglect whereof made God so angry in EzekielEzek. 22.26., and you rightly to observe it: which leades mee to the distinction of consecrated places, and my first generall. 1 'Tis observable, that in those solemne appariti∣ons of God: to Abraham, upon Mount Moriah, where the Passion of Christ was represented in a Type: and to Moses upon Mount Sina, where the ConceptionAccording to that Hymne in the Church: Rubum quem viderat Mo∣ses incombustum, conservatam agno∣vimus virginita∣tem, Sancta Dei genetrix. Similiter Procop. in Exod. of Christ was represented in a Type: and to David in the Threshing floore of Araunah, where the intercession of Christ was represented in a Type: some of them being in that place, where the Temple was to be built, asIoseph. Ant. l. 1, c. 14. l. 7. c. 14. that to Abraham and David upon Moriah: other, where the Tabernacle was commanded to be built, as that to Moses on Sina; there was a distinction of persons enjoyned, in respect of places; which, in some proportion, answered to the distinction of persons and places, in the Tabernacle and the Temple, I and the Lad will goe yonder, saith Abraham: I the Sacrificer, and the Lad the Sacrifice; the Court of the Priests:
but abide you here, 'tis not for you to goe so farre; the Court of the people, Gen. 22.5. Moses was a Type of our Redemption by Christ, delivering Israel out of Egypt: and Iosuah was a Type of our sal∣vation by Christ, bringing Israel into Canaan (for the sonne of man was to effect both by the power of the Sonne of God) and yet put off thy shooes saith God to either; because neitherMoses being not the first-borne, nor extraordinarily called then: Iosu∣ah, though the first-borne, yet suspended altogether then, by the separation of Levi. had power to execute the Priest-hood then: the place where ye stand is Holy, Moses before his consecration may be there: the place where I am is holyer, Moses after his consecration, is scarce holy enough to be here; and as Moses un∣derstood his distance, so did Iosuah too, for he did so: in the fifth of that story, at the fifteenth verse: God afterwards designes Moses to the employment Moses and Aa∣ron among his Priests, Psal. 99. Exod. 40. where be is commanded to do the acts of conse∣cration. of a Priest, that was before a ruler of the people; and to shew the neerenesse of his person, gives him a neerenesse of place: there is one stand for the Layty, another for the Clergy, and yet both with∣out the Mount, in the 19. of Exodus.Verse 21, 22, 24. Aaron with Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy Elders (all of them being Priests by inheritance, or destination) may as∣cend up the Mount, but not up so high upon the Mount, for Moses alone shall come neere the Lord: (into the Sanctuary they may come, they may not come into the Oracle,) in that very Chapter, after which a Mandate is given by GOD for the ordering of the Tabernacle, the foure and twentieth of this story, at the first and second verse. Lastly, David erects an Al∣tar upon Moriah, being then the possession of Araunah, as formerly Abraham had done: consecra∣ted it was by the sacrifices of both, and the appari∣tions of God to both, and in both represented the
satisfaction and mediation of Christ; where he that provided for the building of the Temple, observes the same distance, which was observed in the Taber∣nacle and the Temple, the Altar built neare the place where the Angell stood, but not in it, 2 Sam. 24, 16, 18. Nor was the direction particular in this behalfe, but universall and generall: a distinction of holi∣nesse in their personsExod. 29. Leviticus 8.

Nor did this distinction expire with the Taber∣nacle, but lived also in the Temple; for as MosesHeb. 8.5. went by a patterne before, so did Salomon1 Paralip. 28.6.12, 19. and EzraEzra 2.63. Nehem. 7.64, 65. c. 8.3. after: which the Iewes were so carefull of,

And must God lose part of his honour from us, by sending his Sonne to us? or must there be lesse holinesse in the Church, where he was in truth and substance sacrificed by himselfe, than where he was sacrificed in a type or shadow, by Aaron in the Tem∣ple? Certainly no.

Psalms of degrees we read of; because, 'tis said, they were sung upon those degrees or ascents unto the Tem∣ple; and as there were degrees without the Temple, so are there degrees within the Temple too: different re∣spects due to places, for different degrees in the pla∣ces; the neglect therefore of respects to the Table, was a contempt of the Table, Mal. 1.7.

DamascenDe imag Orat. 3. tels us of a judgement upon the violaters of one Oratory by death: and BedeHist. l. 4. c. 25. tels us of a judgement upon the violaters of another Oratory by fire. He is the Lords annointed, saith David, and therefore God forbid we should touch the King: and this is the Lords annoin∣tedVtion used in Consecration. Gen. 35.14 c. 28.18. Exod. 40.9. Mim. Fel. Octav. &c. too; and therfore God forbid we should wrong the Church: for as a disrespct to the Chare of State reflects upon the King, because he is represented there: so doth a disrespect to the Church reflect upon God, because he is there: the same God through every part therof, but not in the same manner through eve∣ry
part thereof. For as there are different degrees of sanctity in them, so is there a different dispensation of his presence in them too: which leads me to the rea∣son of this distinction, and my second generall. 2. In every consecration there is livery and seisin, giving and taking possession; giving possession by man, and taking by God, and although man take not possession alwayes immediately by himselfe, but me∣diately, sometimes by a proxe: or, though, immedi∣ately by himselfe, he is not personally alwayes present, but for the most part onely relatively there: God al∣wayes takes possession immediately by himselfe, and is alwayes in an especiall manner, personally present, where hee takes possession too: the difference be∣twixt ordinary and extraordinary consecration; con∣secration by donation from man; and consecration by assumption or reservation from God; lying princi∣pally in this: that his presence followes that; but his presence makes this: there 'tis a consequent, and here an antecedent to consecration. For example: God ppeares to Iacob at Luz, in the eight and twen∣tieth of Genesis: 'twas there he saw the Angels as∣cending and descending, that thorow-fare be∣twxt earth and heaven, Verse 12. and thereupon, surely the Lord is in this place, saith he, Verse 16. What ther? how dreadfull is it therefore, seeing the house of God maste inely be, where God cer∣tainly s, and the Gate of Hven, from whence our prayers re ryed by the Angels into Heaven? Verse 17  will hee ever estem it lesse, and the  Pillar where he intends an Altar, Verse  property of the place is alter'd, so is  Lzoce, 'tis Bethel now,
Verse 19. and in this house of God shall his vowes and devotions be performed unto God, the presence of God in that place inferred a consecration of the place, at the last verse of that Chapter. Nor was this the illation of Iacob onely here, but elsewhere of God himselfe: the Lord appeared by an Angell unto David, and the Lord commanded David by a Pro∣phet, goe, reare an Altar there, 2 Sam. 24.18. The Lord appeared by an Angel unto Moses in Sina, and neere Iericho unto Iosuah: the story of Iosuah as∣sures us, God was in an especial manner present there: and the story of Moses assures us, God was in an especiall manner present here, inaccessible. Ioseph An∣tiq. l 3. c. 4. . l. 2. c. 5. it was, both for the steepnesse, and the height, and the fearefull residence of God in the Mount. Moses was the. Ibid. first in those parts, that ever invaded it, saith Iosephus; and the people durst not doe so much, after hee had oftenExod. 3.1. c. 19.3, 20, 24. done so: afarreExod. 20.18. off they are placed, and when they were sanctified too; and yet even here they seeme too neere. Moses's adventure passeth not without aIoseph. Ant. l. 2. c. 5. check, though afterwards he received the Law, and now an embassy, from hence; and when he returnes from Aegypt, his offence must be expiated by sacrifice. God tels him the place is ho∣ly, because his presence made it holy: for as the judge∣ment seat is, where sits the Iudge; so where the Lord is, there is an Altar and an Oracle. . Ibid.
And as the presence of God precedes consecration in those examples, so doth it follow in others. A place there was for Adams devotions and his families, which Cain, as the usuall idiom of Scripture is, cals the face1 Chron. 16.29. Ion. 1.3. Exod. 23.17. Walk. of sacril. &c. of God, according to the opinion of seve∣rall Divines; and which face Abel enjoyed, God te∣stifying his presence, as Theodotio. Mar. Sept. renders, by firing his sacrifice, Gen. 4.5, 14. A tabernacle is erected for Israel in the wildernesse, and the same God, which commanded it to be consecrated, took possession of it, as soone as it was consecrated, Exo. 40.34. a Temple is erected for Israel in Canaan: Solomon2 Chron. 6. 1 Reg. 8. . Ioseph. Ant. l. 8. c. 2. implores Gods especiall mercies, and his especiall assistance, and his especiall presence to such as should performe their Oraisons in, or towards that place, at the conse∣cration; and all these follow upon the consecration2 Chro. 5.13, 14 1 Reg. 6. 13. c. 9.3., 2 Chron. 7.1. Whether therefore it be ordinary, or extraordinary, wheresoever a consecration is, there God especially is, by a peculiar dispensation of his gracious and mercifull presence: so was he to Abra∣ham and Iacob by his covenant and promise, so to Moses and Iosuah by his commission and assistance, so to that whole Nation by his immediate direction and audience, in the Tabernacle and the Temple. And, as there was a greater communication of the divine presence in these places, than in others (whence that erection1 Reg. 8.38, 42, 44, 48. 2 Chron. 6.25, 34.

And as that distinction in holy places continued after Christ, so did the reason of that distinction too: the whole indeed is the house of God, so the Apostle cals1 Tim 3.15. it: because, although the Lord bee without these Walles, he is more within; as we are not pre∣sumed to be so much abroad, as at home: and there∣fore God is not only present extraordinarily himselfe there, as the decrees, the general opinion of Divines, with the formes of consecration shew: but, also, as a learnedB.

And yet, though the Church conceived him to bee present in all parts of this house, it conceived him to bee more present in one part of this house, than in another.

We must believe 'tis there, we must not know how 'tis there: our faith may see it, our sense cannot, 'tis a mystery, they all say; and 'twere no mystery, if 'twere knowne: his presence they determined, the manner of his presence they de∣termined not: they said he is there, and they said the Lord knowes how.

Let our hallelujahs be sent up like the roaring of the Sea, and our Amens like a clap of thunder, as Saint Hierom relates of the Primitive Christians: for thus is the Church an ar∣my with banners in the Canticles, and no way but thus. Let us not only invade God by our single devotions, but by our united cries beleager and besiege him. 'Tis the mountaine of the Lord, because he builds on a Rock that layes his foundation here; and, he that doth not, builds on the sand, and 'tis the house of the Lord, whom we shall find no where, if not here; because to pray, in Gods language, is to meetIob 20.15.

There is a balme justified by someGoclen, &c., which cures at any distance; but this balme of Gilead doth not: it must be applied to the wound, not to the sword; nor can a Sermon have any influence on such
as are not there. The wedding is prepared, goe ye therefore into the high-wayes, and bid to the wedding, goe not into their Chambers, but unto their wayes, where men are to be, not where they are not to be at such times; bid those ye find there, but bid not those ye find not there, saith our SaviourMatth. 22.8. in the Gospell. For, as when we receive summons from our Superiours, the messenger seeks us not in idling places, pursues us not into the fields, comes not to our sports to warne us, but to our houses, there reads his message, as if we were there, because we should be there, and then, without any further enquiry, departs, fastning the Script upon our doores. In like manner, the Priests are Gods Am∣bassadors, saith Saint Paul2 Cor. 5.20.: they are his messengers, saith MalachiMal. 2.7.: God supposeth every man at home, and so do they; because at all consecrated houres, they are presumed to have no houses, but such.

Had those happy soules been blest with such, as we, by the gracious wisdome of a Religious Prince, and the carefull devotion of those Governours under him, enjoy: the ebbe would not
have beene formerly so low, when the Organ was so high: Canonicall houres had beene more canoni∣cally kept; nor would those seats have beene so lanke at prayer, whose originall and fundamentall businesse is nothing but to pray, their midnights would have more filled such, than our noones. What shall be the signe, that I shall goe up to the house of the Lord, saith Hezekiah2 Reg. 20.8, 9.? Shall the shadow goe for∣ward ten degrees, or goe backward, saith Esaiah? The Sunne is too fleet for our zeale already, our Re∣ligion is too long divided betwixt the combe and the glasse, to pray at that rate: and therefore, if the Sun go forward, 'tis a signe we shall not go up; bid the Sun go backward, and then perchance we may. The Pelagians said, there is no sin but by imitation: but, if this had ruled us, that had not beene: for I would all of us sailed by this Card, and all our light were borrowed from this Sunne: Whom remember, O my God,Nehem. 13.14. concerning this, and wipe not out the good deeds that he hath done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof: blessed are they that dwell in thy house, saith David, and therefore blessed be he. God loves an early devotion, and an humble too: We will come, saith the Psalmist, and we will fall low besides: for, as we may appeare in a Court; and yet, by the omission of our service, may be judged not to be there: so if we neglect our homage, we are absent, though we are here: by which I am con∣veighed to the illation upon this reason, and my last generall. 3 The assumption flowes so naturally from the postulata or lemmata, that I might conclude as Ma∣thematicians use; with a constat quod erat demonstran∣dum;
wer't not my resolution to prescribe for the one, as well as for the other; that, as the Church of England assumes the same premisses, so doth she in∣ferre the same conclusion the Church of God hath ever done before. A different holinesse confest there is of places: and 'tis confest too, this ariseth from a different presence of God in places: and there must follow therefore, as by the learned 'tis confest be∣sides, a different respect towards those places: else were there not a suitablenesse betwixt honour and merit, which naturall justice requires; nor should we weigh out our distances so evenly to God, as we doe to man: as the King shines more or lesse up∣on men, we more or lesse regard them, and measure out a different rate of honour or worship, according to that different proportion of either which he be∣stowes.

Nor was this guise of their devotion recorded only as a Practice under the Law; but as a predicti¦on concerning the Gospell: so the Prophets, and more especially that EvangelistEsa. 17.7, 8. c. 66.23. amongst the Prophets: The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the firre-tree, the Pine-tree, and the Boxe together, to beautifie the place of my Sanctuary, and I will make the place of my feet glorious. The sonnes also of them that afflicted thee, shall come bending unto thee; and all they that de∣spised thee, shall bow themselves downe at the soles of thy feet, and they shall call thee the City of the Lord, the Zion of the holy one of Israel. A place of glory it shall be, because it is my Sanctuary; and a place of humility, because I am in my Sanctuary; a place of beauty, and yet a place of bowing and bending too, Esay 60.13, 14. The converted Gentile falling downe in the Church will worship, saith S. Paul1 Cor. 14.25.: and the con∣verted Iewes falling downe did worship, say the E∣vangelistsLuc. 15.19. c. 5.12 Ioh. 9 38. Acts 10.25.: and the departed soules, falling downe, shall worship, saith the ApocalypseApoc. 3.9. c. 4.10. c. 5.14. c. 7.11. c. 11.1.16. c. 15.4.. The first be∣fore an invisible, the rest before a visible presence of God. For the foundation of this homage is not grounded upon the visibility of it, but the truth: whether hee bee seene or not seene, where he thus is, he is thus to be served: as he that sees not, is not lesse neglectfull in the omission of his observance, if he know the King is there, than he that sees his
presence, and observes it not: a Bartimaeus that cannot discerne, than a Mordecai that out-faces him. And in this beliefe, as the Primitive Christians used prostration to God at their Eucharisticall devo∣tions; so did they, at their ordinary too. For that sawcinesse and familiarity of faith was not in fashi∣on then, which brings men to Church without joynts, and sends them from Church without hearts; as if they onely came to keep company, and to sit with God.

And whosoever thinkes not this prescription long enough, had need write annalls ancienter than the world. Since hath Ecclesiasticall adorati∣on
ever beene in use: and I wish, those seditious Corahs of our Israel, would raise no contradiction against that authority, which God hath justly be∣stowed upon his Kings, and their Churches (for to curse God, and the King, in EsaiahEsa 8.21., goes together: because he that doubts not to do one, will undoubt∣edly do the other) but of this date: or that they could shew so quiet and interrupted a possession, such a time out of mind, for the best lands, and Charters they have. Feare not therfore to tread in the same steps with the Church of England, because this treads in the same steps the Church of God ever did before. Those sainted times loved him too well, to love any thing like him; and although they gave a Religious Reve∣rence unto those places, they terminated that religious reverence in God, not in the places: , saithDe Orthod. fid. l. 4 c. 12. Damascene. The house of God was honoured for God, th Throne for the King, the Altar for the Sacrifice: as Alexan∣der adoring Gods name in IaddusIaddus being in al his Priestly robes, . Ioseph. Antiq. l. 11. c. 8. mitre, adored God alone, neither Iaddus, nor his mitre: and he that re∣spects a house for the owners sake, respects not his house, but him, so much they said; but to justifie the practice of our Church, I need not say so much. For, as although the humane nature of Christ receive all from the divine, we adore the whole suppositum in grosse, which consists of the humane as well as the di∣vine: so, because of Gods personall presence in the place, we adore him, without an abstraction of his Per∣son from the place. 'Tis not the Altar we worship, but the Lord towards the Altar: no prostration to a false God, but a prostration before the true God: pulveri∣satio
nihileitatis nostrae, as à Kempis upon another occa∣sion speakes, an acknowledgement of our vilenesse, and Gods infinitenesse; of our originall out of dust, and our re∣solution into dust; a confession of His being there, and our humiliation to Him that is there: an adoration of him that is not seene, looking on that which is seene: no Altar against God, but as that in IosuahIos. 22.25. was an Altar for God; nor an Altar of any strange worship, but of witnesse. O worship the Lord in the beauty of holinesse, saith DavidPsal. 96.9.; 'tis a place of holinesse, and therefore no Layfee for Mammon: and a place of beauty, and therefore no resort for our pollution. 'Tis Bethel the house of God, frequent it we must for his sake: and Bethlem, the house of bread, frequent we must for our owne. Here dwels our Physitian, ô let us run to the God of our health, as David cals him, and here en∣campes our general, ô let us flie to the God of our strength, as Moses; this is  in Damascene. Da∣masc. Orat. 1. & 2. de imag.; a universall anti∣dote that never failed, no languishing soule miscarried: and this is , in IosephusThe Cuthites or Samaritans accused the Iewes, that they built a Temple . Ios. An∣tiq. l. 11. c. 4., an impregnable fort, that never was taken yet (the same word in Hebrew. Joseph. Antiq. l. 7 c. 3. signify∣ing the Temple, and safety too) no distressed soule perished there. Antiochus Eupator indeed besieged Iudas Maccabe∣usId. l. 12. 14. thus, with what successe the story tels, because he might as well have besieged him in heaven, as there: for who can be blockt up here, that converseth with the Lord which is every where? or want succours, that maintaines correspondence, and intercourse with God? Ho, every one that thirsteth, saith the Prophet; nay, every one that is hungry, and every one that is sickly, and every one that is in distresse, and every one that is in debt, and every one that is discontented too. Behold the Altar, and the Sa∣crifice; a Lamb in a thicket, Christ intangled in a Crown of Thornes: the Lambe of God that hath taken away the sins of the world, and therefore ours: that hath wiped out all our
scores, hath stricken all our Tallies; that brake the bars of hell by his descent into hell, and opened the gates of hea∣ven by his Ascension. O let us enter therfore into these Courts with thanksgivings, and into these gates with praise: enter with preparation, as unto God; for he that comes hither as he is, goes away as he was; and enter with reverence, as in the presence of God; for he that prayes, as if God were not here, when he hath prayed, shall finde him no where. Enter with our soules, because God loves no sacrifie but the heart: and enter without our sins, because God heares not Vs, if we hearken not to him. Enter all eare, while God speakes to us; all heart and tongue, while we speake to God; because, if the heart go one way, and the tongue another: if we turne this house into an exchange or a stewes, by thinking in this house, on our gaines or our lusts; we defile not the Temple, as AntiochusIoseph. Antiq. l. 13. c. 16., by engraving the simili∣tudes of uncleane beasts on these doores, but by bringing them within. Enter by the humiliation of our soules, and enter with the prostration of our bodies; because as this, without that, is a dead oblation; so that, without this, is a maimed one. AdamanBed. hist. l. 5. in Bede tels, in his discourse of holy places, from the mouth of a Bishop, who had beene there: that in a Church erected in that place, from whence our Saviour ascended, there rushed annually in those times, a violent gale of winde from heaven upon Ascension Day, which forced all those it found standing, to fall prostrate on the earth. I doe not justifie the relati∣on, and yet 'tis ancient; only I wish, that when we come hither, we need no winde from heaven to humble us here: but that falling downe by the dejection of our bodies, we may rise up by the exaltation of our soules, and living in his feare, may dye in his favour: which the Father of mercies grant us all, for the merits of his Sonne, to whom, &c.
