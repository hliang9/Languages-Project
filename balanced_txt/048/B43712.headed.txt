A Weapon of Defence against Sud∣den Death. ON the first day of March this present year, 1656. which is called Saint Davids day there was one David Har∣rison living in the Town of Meedly in Yorkshire, a Taylor by trade, who was given very much to mocking, scoffing, and jéering, Swearing, Drunkenness, and the like; It chanced so that he com∣ming into an Al-house where were som of his acquaintance, he sate down to drink with them, being half drunk be∣fore he came in; so his Neighbours shewed him civil respect, and bade him sit down: Now mark what after came to pass, this David Harrison said, and did swear a most bloody Oath, that he would make all the folks in the house drunk of his own charge, in honour of his name, because it was S. Davids day, so calling in for a dozen together, he be∣gan to drink Healths to one, and to a∣nother, so long, that he had made him∣self so drunk, that he coule hardly go or
stand, his Neighbours all perswaded him to forbear swearing and drinking, and ho go home, but the more they per∣swaded him, the worse he was, for eve∣ry time he drunk he spew'd it up again, and every time he spake he swore a bloody Oath, and at the last he sware God dam him body and soul if he did not drink himself sober again, before he did go out of the house; but in that he was falsly for sworn, for as he put the Flagon pot to his mouth, thinking to have swal∣lowed down all the drink, his nose burst out a bleeding, and he fell backwards to tee round like a man distracted of his wits, where he lay cursing and swearing néer upon eight and forty hours, for his bleeding at nose could never be stopt nor stinted, till such time he had bled him∣self to death; and now Ile leave it for all men to judge whether this man had not his death deservedly. But surely, though a man will say, that every one shall have that Death which is allotted for them; My opinion is this, if he had served God in a better maner, he might have come to a better end, and that if he had made good use of
his time, he might have lived many a fair year longer; But to be brief, the matter that is here spoken of was sent up in a Letter from the Masters of the Parish were it was done, and desired to have it put in Print, to the end that all Mockers and Scorners, Swearers, and Pot-companions, both in the City of London, and in all other places may take warning hereby, and with speed a∣mend their sinfull lives, which GOD grant we may all do. Here followeth another strange and tru Relation of the deplorable life and untimely death of James Parnell, a Quaker. SOme people of England are now grown to such a giddy-headed man∣ness, the like was never known in any Age before, as it ma appear by one James Parnel a Quaker, which traveled up and down from place to place prea∣ching and teaching false Doctrine, and telling them that all that were not of
his Congregation were damned to e∣ternity; moreover he said, how that the Bible was of none effect, and that Davids Psalms were but Ballads: Furthermore he said, that he himself was a Prophet, and that he could do as many Miracles as Christ did do when he was living on the earth, and that he was able to make the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, the lame to go, the blind to see, and to raise the dead to life a∣gain; Now mark what became of him at the last, through his vain-glorious opinion of himself, After he had travel∣led through many Cities, Towns, and Countries, as London, Bristol, Glo∣cester, Exester, Salisbury, Worcester, Hereford, Cicester, Chichester, South∣hampton, the Ile of Wight, Winchester, and many other places, still teaching the people after his own inventions; He came at last into the County of Essex, where he finished up his last dayes, the manner how was thus, he told the peo∣ple there, that if they would believe in him he would shew them a miracle, and said that as Christ fasted forty dayes and forty nights, so would he undertake
to do, but for seducing the people, and bringing them to a false belief, and for his Blasphemies, he was apprehended, and sent to Colchester, and there kept in prison, where he undertook (as he said he would do) to fast forty days and nights, so because he should have no ex∣cuse for his falacy, he was watcht that none should come to give him victuals in private, but if he would eat openly in the sight of the people, he was allowed to have as much victuals as he would desire, to be set before him every day: But to be brief, he still continued in his own wilfull fopperies, and fasted ten days and nights together, and ne er ta∣sted of one bit of bread nor drop of drink, and all this was done because he would have been though to have been a Pro∣phet, but the eleventh day he became to be so hungry, that he had no longer po∣wer to forbear, but call'd for food, and had it brought unto him, but alas it did do him no good, for by reason of his o∣ver long fasting, his guts and intrails were clammed up, and clung together, insomuch that the victualls could not have its naturall passage into the parts
of his body which it should have gone into, and so in that miserable taking was starved to death, having plenty of victuals at command, but could not eate. And being dead a Iury of men went upon him, whereby to find the true man∣ner of the cause of his death, and so at the last they gave up their Verdict to this purpose, that he was guilty of his own death, and that he had done wilfull murder upon himself, in that he restrai∣ned himself from that bodily sustenance that the Lord in mercy hath ordained for the relief of all mankind: And be∣cause no one shall have any cause to make any doubt of the truth hereof, it is witnessed by Master Jude Tayler the Fore-man of the Inquest, and Master Joseph Smith, another of the Inquest, who with the consent of Master Alder∣man Gael of Colchester, the Verdict was given in and approved, on May the fifth, 1656.
Here is a true Relation of a most horri Murder commited on the River o Thames by two Watermen, and after∣wards discovered by themselves, who were excecuted for the same Murder in July last, 1656 at Maidstone in Kent and afterwargs brought to Graaefend and their hang'd in Chains both up∣on one Gibbet, for others to take warning there by; The manner was as followeth. IN the year that is here spoken of, on the time which is called my Lord Maiors day, a young man that lived neer Smithfield-Bars, whose name was Chri∣stopher Savage unfortunatey kill'd his Mother-in-law with a stab of a knife, the cause wherefore it was done there's no man can tell, for so soon as ever he had done the bloody deed he ran away, and so took Boot to go by water because he would not be discovered, but as they were upon the water, he began to tell the watermen strange matters, and said that he was a Grasier, and had been at a
Fayre and sold a great many head of Cattle; moreover he said that his busi∣nesse was in great haste, and that if they ould row apace he would pay them well for their pains, for he said he had money enough; whereupon the Water∣men seeing the Coast to be clear, laid by their Oars and ran suddenly upon him, to one held him that he should not stirre whilst the other cut his throat; No soo∣ner was this bloody murder performed, but they took away his money, tyed a great stone about his body, because he should sink to the bottom, & so threw him over-boord into the water, thinking that he should never be seen nor heard of a∣gain: But now mark the wonderfull works of the Lord, how strangly mur∣der will be brought to light, though it be don never so secretly, these two Wa∣termen which had don the Murder after∣wards fell out about sharing the Money, one of their names was Smith, and the others name was Gurney, both of them dwelling in Gravesend; Sometimes Smith would say when they were in a place where they thought no body could hear them, that Gurney had more share
of the Money then he dad; Sometimes Gurney would say that Smith had the greatest part of the Money; but at one time amongst the rest they fell out grie∣vously, and were ready to fight about it, and one of them told the other in plaine terms that he was the party that cut the mans throat, and cast him over-boord, which words were heard and taken no∣tice of, whereupon they were both appre∣hended and sent to Maidstone Gaole, and at the Assizes were found guilty by the Iury, condemned by the Iudge, and according to their deserts were both hang'd in Chaines neer Gravesend in Kent, where all the Passengers that goes or comes that way either by Land or by Water may see them.
Here followeth another strange Relati∣on which is very well known to be true. UPon the twentieth day of Iuly, this presant year 1656. in the county of Norfolk there hapned such a dreadfull tempest of Thunder. Lightning, Hayle Rayne, and Whirle-winds, that the lie thereof was never seen nor known in England by the oldest man or wom∣an that is now alive, which tempest first of all began at the City of Norwich, it being then the Sabath of the Lord about four or five a clock in the afternoon; the maner how the tempestious weather began in Norwich was in this manner; The first aparitions that were seen and taken notis of was Lightning and thun∣der in a most strange and vyolent maner which made the people all amazed that saw the lightning and heard the thunder, in so much that som thought that the world was then at an end, but tis very known that their ws sorrowas was not then at an end, let them think what they
would, for it was so that in a little time after there appeared a mighty black Hitchy Cloud, which darkned both the Sun and the Skye, insomuch that the that stood one close to another, could hardly know one from another, yet that Cloud afforded store of fire, in such plenty, as if it had come from the mouth of a Furnace, with such a smoakes if it had proceeded from hell it self. Then presently after followed a bright shining Cloud, which the people under∣stood to be a token of Gods mercy to∣wards them, and so it was indeed, for had the black Clowd continued a longer time there, it is supposed by men of good understanding, that matters had hap∣ned worse then they did, and it was too bad as it wwas, for why immedietely there came such a mighty storme of Hayl and Rain that powred down as if Hea∣ven and Earth would come together, with a strong whirl-wind, that the force thereof beat down many Buildings; and made the Glass windows to flye in pieces, insomuch that five thousand pouds will not suffice to make that good that was spoyled at that time,
Some of the Hail-stones being taken up were found to be as big as Pidgeons Eggs, some as big as Hens Eggs, and some bigger. But that's not all, for the Countrey round about felt and suffered greater ex∣tremities; for by the means of the dread∣full Lightning that fell from the Sky, there were many Ricns of Hay and Corn set on fire, and by the violence of the Thunder, and Whirl-wind, houses were beaten to the ground, and many people lost their lives. A multitude ef Corn was quite destroyed by Lightning and Thunder, and Trées were torn up by the yoots; Birds flying in the ayre were stricken dead, and Herbs and Flowers in fields and Gardens blasted Some grounds that were fruitfull and bre Corn on Saturday night, was made like Plou'd land before Monday mor∣ning: These things (dear Christans) are hard to be believed, but it is known to be too true. And now to draw to a conclusion let us consider that this was the handy work of the Almighty God of Heaven and Earth, and that he that did so by them,
can do the like to us therfore let us all with faithful hearts and true repentance seek the Lord whilst he may be found in mercy. One thing more is to be considered concerning the hayle-stones that fell in the City of Norwich how them that were the bigest and greatest of all were of divers severall shapes and fashions, som of them had the likeness of a mans eye to be seen in them, some had the likeness of a mans face; some of them were like Great Buttons which is a fa∣shion that is now in great request in the City; some of them were like pieces of Ice, and had the likeness of a Lion upon them, and many other strange shapes were then to be seen: These things in the judgment of the world seems to be impossible, but there is nothing impossi∣ble to God; and verile I am perswa∣ded that God sent these wonderfull signs and tokens amongst them so sudden and unexpectedly, to put us all in mind of a greater sorrow that will shortly come upon the World, except we speedily re∣pent and amend our sinful lives.
UPon the five and twentieth day of Iuly, at Lemster, and the Coun∣trey thereabouts there was such a hor∣rible Tempest of Thunder and Light∣ning, which destroyed and blasted a num∣berless deal of Corn, of Hops, and of Garden fruits, and Orchard fruits, in∣somuch that many people are undon by the means thereof: And at Bransyard in Wrcestershire the Lightning set four Barns on fire that self-same nigh. The 26. day of Iuly in Nottingham∣shire there was a wonderfull strange tempestuous weather, the like whereof there's no man alive can remember, for in the darksom time of the night there a∣rose such a terrible Tempest of Thun∣der, Lightning, Hail and Rain, as if heaven and earth would come together; insomuch that the people that were tra∣velling upon the road, might by means of the flashes of Lightning sée every way what was before & behind them, as brief as if it had been at noon day, by means whereof were many Barns, Ricks, and Fields of standing Corn burned and consumed to ashes, and many people kild with the Thunder. FINIS.
