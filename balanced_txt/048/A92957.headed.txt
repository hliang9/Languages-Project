A Funeral TEAR, TO THE MEMORY OF THE HONOURABLE Capt. Iames Killigrew: WHO Unfortunately lost His Life in His MAJESTY's Service, in an Engagement with Two French Men of War, in the Mediterranean Sea; on the 27th. of January last, 1694/5. Immodicis Brevis est Aetas, & rara Senectus. By E. SETTLE. LONDON: Printed for R. Hayhurst, in Little-Britain, 1695.
A Funeral Tear, &c. HOW strangely Nature does Her Treasures heap; Her Richest Jems, in Cabinets so Cheap! Her Sparks of Heav'n to Walls of Earth dispos'd, And the Great Souls in Brittle Clay enclos'd: All Riches have their Wings; ev'n Courage dies; The Casket breaks, and vanishing Jewel flies: Weak-Armour'd Life! In Wars destroying Field, Neither the Champion, nor the Cause, can shield! In Her whole List, Britannia ne'er cou'd boast More Hopeful WORTH, nor more Ʋntimely lost; Not wak'd, like Sluggards, at their Noon-day Sun; HONOƲR His Active Morning Race begun: Such YOƲTH did never Manlier Virtue grace, The Soul of Mars, in an Endimion's Face! YOƲTH, where those equal Charms all smiling grew, For Cynthia's Darling, and Bellona's too! Nor in His single Veins such COƲRAGE runs; Sprung from a Race, adopted Neptune's Sons; Cheer as Their Quarrel, when bold Danger calls, And Stout, as Their own Floating Castle Walls: His Brother's FLAG, with His own Streamers, joyn'd; Hereditary Brav'ry! Comes of Kind! Methinks, I see His Single dauntless Hulk, Against His Two tall Foe's o'er-topping Bulk, Deal round Her Roaring Deaths, in Iron Ball; Unequal Combat, English VALOƲR All: There wanted so much Odds His Fate to push, Whom less than Weight, and Numbers, ne're cou'd crush. But let not His Insulting Gallic Foes Too proudly boast this Young cropt English ROSE; That Vanity Their Sanguine Blushes tell: He dy'd Their Lillies Crimson, e're He fell. Nay, such true COƲRAGE fought, ev'n beyond Death; His Thunder still surviv'd, whilst His Last Breath Does to His Neptune-Successors inspire His own Great SOƲL, that Transmigrating Fire,
That to Their Arms Life, Spir'it, and Vengeance lends, The hovering Genius His Own Conquest ends. Nor was this Scene of Albion Glory pent In Her own Wat'ry Walls, (Her Vassal Element;) The Tyrrhene Strand did at those Bolts rebound; Not Thames, but listning Tyber, heard the Sound: Nor Rome's alone, but Rome's old Rival Shoar; Her Carthage Africk-Coast, the Echo bore: Nay, ev'n the Neighb'ring Crescent must Proclaim The British CROSS's envy'd Race of FAME: Such Distant HONOƲR, her far Thunder hurld, To drive her Hunted Foes around the World. Thus his proud Fame, on Her most tow'ring Wings, At once His Dirge, and Io Paean, sings; A Fate, that ev'n in Death the Triumph bore: The great Gustavu's Fall cou'd do no more. But, oh! hard Fated Lawrels! This Young Head So early lodg'd in Honour's Fatal Bed! But when in that sweet Bloom, such COƲRAGE dies, His Mourners are not only Martial Eyes; The God, and His own Anvil Cyclop-Crew, Their Tears to that Young Hand, so justly due: A Hand, that from Their own Great Forge cou'd weild Their Massiest Bolts; their keenest Lightning held: But the whole Nine, each Muse, and ev'ry Grace, Must, at this Loss, bedew her Virgin Face. Yes, If the Humbler Muses feebler Sound, Is not in all Thy louder Tritons drown'd; Their softest Harmony shall tune Thy Praise, And chant Thy Name in Her Immortal Lays. What tho' in Foreign Tombs Thy Ashes sleep, And distant Ʋrns those Envy'd Reliques keep; Yet still Thy Native Albion Soyl alone, Shall claim thy Birth, a Glory all her Own. What more Thou leav'st behind, that larger Claim, Thy fair Example, and thy fragrant FAME, More than One single Nation shall supply; Let the whole World Divide Thy MEMORY. FINIS.
