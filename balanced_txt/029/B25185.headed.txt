James II's arms HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT By the King's Most Excellent Majesty. JAMES R. WE having thought fit to appoint in convenient parts of the City, a certain number of Suttling-Houses, that are to furnish the Army with Ale at two pence per quart, from which Houses only they are to be furnished at that rate, and for which Our Will and Pleasure is, that they pay ready Money. And for the better distinction of such Houses, We have appointed a Sign to be put up at each Suttler's door, with this Inscription, in English and French; Ale to be Sold at two pence the quart, by the King's Order, paying ready Money. Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, That no Officer, Soul∣dier, or others, do presume to give any disturbance to any Houses that retail Beer or Ale, on that occasion; nor that they run in score, nor commit any disorders therein, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost peril. Given at Our Court at Dublin Castle this 10th day of June 1690. And in the sixth year of Our Reign. Marquiss d'Albyvile. DƲBLIN, Printed by Andrew Crook on Ormonde-Key.
