¶How the lāde of Englōde was fyrst named Albion / ād by what encheson it was so named THer was in the no∣ble lāde of Sur∣re a no∣ble my∣ghti kīg & a mā of grete renome that men called Dioclisi∣an: that well & worthely hym go∣uerned and ruled thurgh his no∣ble chiualrie. So that he conque∣red all the landes about hym: so that almost all the kynges of the world to him were entēdant Hit befell thus that thys Dyoclesian spoused a gentill damysell that was wōder fair. and was his E∣mes doughter. ād men called hyr labana. And she loued hȳ as resō wolde. so that he gate vpon her .xxxiij. doughtres / of the whiche the eldest men called Albine. and thees damiselles whā they comē vnto age: they bicomen so fayre / that it was wōder: Wherfor that this Dyoclisian anon̄ let make a somaunce / & commaūded by his lrēs that alle the kinges that hel∣den of hȳ shold come at a certaȳ day as in hyr lrēs were cōteyned to make a ryall feste / At whyche day thider they comē & brought wyt hem amyrallis princes & du∣kes ād noble chyualrye. The fest was rially arayed / & ther they ly∣ued en ioye and myrthe ynough that it was wōder to wit. And it befell thus that thys Dyoclisian thought to marie his doughtres amōg all the kinges that tho we∣re at that solēpnite{punctel} & so they spa∣ken ād ded that albyne his eldest doughter & all hir sustres richely were maried vnto .xxxiij. kin∣ges that were lordes of grete ho∣nour & of power at this solēpnite And whan the solempnyte was done: every king toke his wyf ād lad hē in to her owne contre and ther made hē quenes. And it be∣fell thus afterward that this da∣me albyne bycome so stoute & so sterne that she tolde lytel prys of her lorde. & of hym had scorne ād despit & wolde not done his wyll but she wolde haue hyr owne wil in diuerse maters. & all hyr other sustres euerichone bere hē so euel ayēst hyr lordes that it was wō∣der to wyt / and for asmoch̄ as hē thought that hyr husbondes we∣re nought of so hye {per}age comen: as hyr fadre But the kinges that were hyr lordes wolde haue casti∣sed him with fayr speche & behes∣tes / and also by yeftes / & warned hem in fayr maner vpon all loue & frēdship that they sholde amē∣de her lyther condycyons / but all
was for nought. for they dydden hyr owne will in alle thyng that hem lyked & had of power / Wher¦for the xxxiij. kynges vpō a tyme and often tymes beten hyr wifes for they wēd that they wolde ha∣ue amēded her tacches & hir wik∣ked thewes / but of suche condici∣ons they were. that for fair spech̄ and warnyng they dydden alle the wers / and for betynges eftso∣nes mochel wers / Wherfore the kyng yt had wedded albyne wro∣te the tacches and condicions of hys wyfe albyne. & sent the letter to dioclisian hyr fadre / And whā the other kinges herde that alby∣nes lord had sent a letter to Dyo∣clisiā. anone they sent lettres en∣sealed with hyr seales the condy∣cyons & the tacches of hyr wyfes also. Whan the noble kȳg dyocli∣sian saw and herd so many com∣playntes of hys doughtres: he was sore ashamed & became wō∣der angrye & wroth toward hys doughtres. ād thought both nig∣ht & day how that he might amē¦de it that they so mysded. And a∣none sent he his lrēs vnto ye xxxiij kȳges that they shold come to hȳ & bringe with hem hir wifes eue∣richone at certaȳ day. for he wol∣de ther castyse them of their wik∣kednesse / yf he might in any ma∣ner or wyse: So that the kīges ca∣men alle at that day & tyme that tho was sette bytwene hȳ / & the kyng Dioclisian vnderfeng hem all with moche honour & made a solempne feest to alle that were vnder his lordship / And the thrid¦de day after that solempnite the noble kyng Dioclisian sent after hys .xxxiij. doughtres that they shold come ād speke wyth him in his chābre / and whan they were come to hir fadre. he spake vnto hem of hyr wikkednesse ād of hir crueltie. and dispytously hem re∣proued & vndernam{punctel} and to hem he said that yf they wold not be chastysed they shulde his loue le∣se for euermore And when the la∣dyes herdē all thys / they becamē moch̄ abasshed & gretly ashamyd & to her fadre they sayd / that they wold make alle amēdes & so they departed owt from hyr fadres chambre: And dame albyne that was the eldest suster lad hem alle to hyr chābre and to made voyde alle that were therȳne so that no lyue was amōge hē. but she & hyr sustres. Tho sayd this albine. my fayr sustres well we knowē that the kȳg our fadre vs hath repro∣ued shamed & despysed for enche∣sō to make vs obediēt vnto oure housbōdes: but certes that shal j neuer whiles yt j lyue. syth that I am come of a more hyer kynges blode thā mȳ husbōde is / & whā she had th{us} sayd: all hir sustrē said ye same / & tho sayd albyne. j wote wel fayre sustres yt our husbōdes
