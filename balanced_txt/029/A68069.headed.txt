A DECLARATION OF THE CAVSES, FOR THE WHICH, WEE FREDERICK, BY THE GRACE OF GOD KING OF BOHEMIA, COVNT PALATINE OF THE RHINE, EL∣ECTOR OF THE SACRED EM∣PIRE, &C. haue ACCEPTED OF THE CROWNE OF BOHEMIA, AND OF THE COVN∣TRYES THEREVNTO annexed. CAESAR AVGVSTVS MIDDLEBVRG. Printed by Abraham Schilders. M.D.C.xx.
FREDERICKE, By the Grace of GOD, King of BOHEMIA, Count Palatine of the RHINE, Elector of the Sacred EMPIRE, Duke of BAVARIA, Marquisse of MORAVIA, Duke of SILESIA and LVXEMEVRG, Marquisse of the Higher and Lower LVSASIA, &c. TO ALL Potentates, Electors, Prin∣ces, and States of Christendome, happy Greeting. WEE make no doubt, but all in ge∣nerall, residing either within or without the Empire, doe now suf∣ficiently vnderstand the miserable and most perilous estate, into which the Kingdome of BOHEMIA is reduced, being so Famous for Antiquitie, and a principall member of the Sacred Empire, as also the Countryes thereunto annexed and Incorpora∣ted, with other bordering Prouinces. Neither can they be ignorant of such actions of Oppres∣sion, hostilitie, and violence, which haue beene practised within a little time, through continuall Rapines, Murders, Combustions, Deuastations, plentifull effusion of Innocent blood, violation and rauishing, both of Wiues and honest Vir∣gins, dismembring of little sucking Children, with many other inhumane, most Cruell, and Barbarous insolences. In like manner the true source and originall of all these euils, of what af∣terwards ensued, or may in future time accrue,
most euidently appeareth and is as cleare as day, both by experience, and the ample Relations that haue beene diuers times made thereof; that they who by their depraued Councels, and sug∣gestions, haue bene the means to precipitate the mightier sort, into present danger and losse, are now themselues conuinced, euen within their owne consciences. And notwithstanding the successe of these latter times, wherein sundry o∣pinions haue been hatched, about the subiect of Religion, may make one clearely discerne with his eye, and (as it were) touch with his finger, that according to the veritie of holy Scripture, and a Maxime heretofore, held and maintayn'd, by the ancient Doctors of the Church, that mens Consciences, ought in no sort to be violated, vr∣ged, or constrained; and whensoeuer men haue attempted any thing by this violent course, whe∣ther openly, or by secret meanes, the issue hath beene pernicious, and the cause of great and wonderfull innouations, in the principallest and mightiest Kingdomes, and Countries of all Chri∣stendome: Yet so it is,The Iesuits. that a certaine extraua∣gant, and strange kinde of people, hauing disper∣sed themselues ouer Christendome, but especial∣ly within the Empire, and other Kingdomes and Countries, bordering and depending thereupon,
and hauing there brought in, and planted a new Doctrine, absolutely funestall and obnoxious, to all Potentates, and Magistrates: nay and fur∣ther, hauing not onely obtained fauour and ac∣cesse to great men, but also drawne to their own bent, both their Councellours, and Officers, and generally the most Honourable, and opulent of euery place, through the false charme, of a coun∣terfeit and masked Sanctitie, an implaceable de∣sire and thirst, did meruailously grow and in∣crease, of persecuting all those, who were sepe∣rated from the Romaine Church, yea and totally to extirpate them, if they did not yeeld, and come vnder that Iurisdiction. Whereupon, it came to passe, that notwithstanding all the good endeauours, that precedent Princes, and Gouer∣nours haue bestowed both in the Empire, and more especially in the Kingdome of BOHEMIA, for preseruation of common Peace, and carying an euen hand between the adherents of the one, and th'other Church, conformable to the Con∣cessions, and Edicts of pacification, granted in fauour of Religion: their Successors for all this (more through others instigation, questionlesse, then of their owne proper disposition) haue beene vrged so farre, as to giue a large field of leaue and Libertie to these pestiferous kinde of
people and their complices, who entring here∣vpon into a full and mayne Careir, they presu∣med somtimes to innouate one thing, then ano∣ther, and not onely by publike writing to draw into doubt and controuersie, but also really to annihilate and make frustrate the said Concessi∣ons, liberties of Religion, Pacts, Obligations and Oathes, solemnly assumed for their confirmatiō. But wee will not heere set downe in particu∣lers, what hath beene practised for many yeares since, and attempted in all parts of the Empire, vpon the purchase of this Licence and Lliberty; neither in how weake and instable manner, af∣faires still continue and stand: referring our selues herein, to that, which Time shall further manifest by sufficient tryals and proofes, in whatsoeuer shall be requisite and conuenient. But as for the Crowne of BOHEMIA, and the Countryes thereunto annexed, wee must no wayes dissemble it, and it is very well knowne, that according as the light of the holy Gospell spred his beames more and more from time to time, the lustre and repute of the Roman Ca∣tholike Religion, hath there beene wonderfully eclipsed, not without procuring much trouble and strife: so that finally, it most necessarily be∣houed to prouide for the maintainance of com∣mon
Peace and tranquillitie within the Realme, and this was effected by certain permissions and Licences, to preuent, that diuersity of Religion might not wholly alter or disturbe a generall and peaceable humane Societie. So long as things remained in these indifferent tearmes, both one and other party held themselues well contented. But those turbulent Spirits, of whom wee for∣merly spake, hauing no will to consent to pub∣like repose and peace, they rather chose to ha∣zard and reduce thinges to an vtter extremity, then to diminish the least tittle of that intention which was so deeply grauen in their hearts; which was, that all things might come vnder the Popes spirituall iurisdiction, and at last, vn∣der the secular Dominion of some strange and forraigne gouernment. All which added more and more agrieuances and molestations to Reli∣gion. And aboue all the rest, many plots were laide to frustrate the Royall Letters and Con∣cessions of his Majesty, to dimolish, or at least shut vp, the Euangelical Churches, and Temples newly built, to raise vp thunderings, and threat∣nings amongst the Estates, to interdict, and actu∣ally prohibite their lawfull defence, horribly to persecute the poore Subiects, with comminati∣ons of more terrible Oppression, Insults, with
losse of body, Life, and goods, besides sundry o∣ther in-iustices, perpetrated against men of eue∣ry seuerall condition. And on the other side, when naturall and iust resistance, opposed these insolences, or any other meanes which necessity vrged vnto, as those Manifests published by the said Estates can testifie, they of the contrary par∣ty, in stead of referring their cause to reason and equall hearing, proceeded further, by open ho∣stilitie, and force of Armes to such a point, that a good part of the said Kingdom of BOHEMIA, and the Prouinces Incorporate, remayneth now dismembred by Fyer, and Sword, being (as it were) turned into Blood, and Ashes. Whereun∣to, we might also add, that whereas many yeares since, and especially the last past, the said King∣dome, and Countryes, haue exposed their liues, and substance, for the Defence and maintenance of the Crowne of HVNGARIE, but aboue all o∣ther, of the Frontier Fortifications, against the Forces of the Turke, a puissant, and dreadfull e∣nemy to Christendome; quite contrary, and as it were, for an accumulation of all euils, the said places were vnfurnished both of Men, Artillery, and warlike munition, that the same might bee employed against the Bohemian Nation, which was appointed, and ordayned against the Turke.
Moreouer, they haue in the Empire, not onely exacted that which remain'd yet vnpayed of the olde Contributions against the Turke: but also vnder a speciall pretext of the preseruation and defence of the said places, in certaine Precincts and Prouinces of the Empire, they haue impo∣sed new Subsidies, which being obtayned and Collected in a great part, it was no wayes im∣ployed to the pretended vse, and end, but rather to the ruyne and desolation of the members of the Empire, and their dependances. By meanes whereof, one may see the Vauntmure, and Bul∣warke of Christendome full of holes, and brea∣ches, ready to tumble and fall downe. And this gaue the HVNGARIAN Nation, sufficient war∣ning, to looke to their own securitie & Defence. We also suppose it is no lesse generally known, with what care, affection, and loue, how we and other Electors and Princes (yea and some for∣raine Potentates likewise) by our exhortations and intercessions, haue procured all the best Of∣fices possible, to quench and extinguish that fire, which daily spread it selfe more and more in the said Kingdome, and to deuise some meanes how to preuent a greater disaster. And in truth, no∣thing would haue been more pleasing to vs then to see those differences and oppositions accruing
between Princes and Subjects, soone appeased and ended by an Admission of the Estates of the same Countries, to heare and determine therein, as heretofore the laudable and commendable Custome was, and by vs out of sincere and vis∣cerall affection in due time Vrged and moued: by reason that the Intermission of remote Prin∣ces and Potentates procured great losse of time, and very often augmented suspicion & distrust. But all present circumstances clearely mani∣fest, what fruit or effect the said aduertisements brought forth, seeing vnder, colour of a suspen∣sion of Armes, there hath not onely many Monthes passed ouer head, during which time, the enemy hath not ceased to forage and spoyle; But moreouer vnder shadow of deferring it, to such an interposition, there hath also a long space of time slipt away: whereas in such dangerous and imminent cases, and when hostile Actions are dayly re-enforced, we ought effectually to make vse of other more expedite meanes to worke a cessation, for it had bin imposible pro∣fitably to haue treated of any Accommodation, by way of Interposition, without first stopping the course of the fore-mentioned Hostilities, and setting downe a preualent, and validius security. Besides all this (no doubt rather by the sug∣gestions
of some persons, who hauing lost all hope of attaining their ends and scopes by leni∣tie and mildenes, aspired thereunto by way of Armes) they were negligent and careles, to lay hold of the iust & opportune occasion of re-esta∣blishing the Peace, which after the death of the Emperour MATHIAS deceased, of laudable me∣mory, presented it selfe; in that they would by no meanes lend their eares, to the wholsome counsell of good Patriots, nay of persons consti∣tuted in high place and Dignity, to recouer (as was most fit and requisite) alienated hearts, and affections: but rather they made choise, to fol∣low the directions of some vnnaturall and dis∣loyall Bohemians, and of others, either wholly strangers or relying and hanging meerly vpon them. From hence it succeeded, that in stead of reall satisfaction and security, for that, where now they were so strictly bound and oblieged, nothing was offered more then promises, and Confirmations in papers and writings. And by the same course, they laboured to possesse them∣selues of the Kingdome by Armes, to ouerthrow the foundamentall Lawes and Priuiledges of the Country, to eneruate the obseruance of them, (though this should be the only platforme of all other obligations) to prostitute those Countries,
which haue a prerogatiue of free Election, to the yoake of gouernments Hereditary, and to con∣clude (at what rate soeuer) to compasse effects, conformable to their designes, and vnder colour of punishing some few nocents, to extirpate and destroy many thousands of Innocents. Wherein also, they imployed the assistance of strange Na∣tions, very ill affected to all Euangelicall profes∣sors; of whom, a great number, and many thou∣sands both Foote and Horse, yea whole Regi∣ments at a time, haue marched through the Countries of the Empire, (although, without consent of the Electors, the Emperor himselfe, hath no Authority nor power) to conduct them against the Estates of BOHEMIA, & the Prouin∣ces annexed, for the wreaking of their euill affe∣ction, & to enrich themselues, with their spoyle. But contrariwise, if too manifest a true inten∣tion to Peace, they had deposed Armes from the beginning, remou'd the Authors of these trou∣bles, prouided for the gouernment of the Estate, by the aduise and cooperation of the Prouinces, remidyed so many aggrieuances, restored the vi∣olated priuiledges, and taken order for their ob∣seruance, by meanes of a sufficient securitie, (without which all other courses had bene but vaine) they might easily haue wrought a Peace,
and diuerted greater alterations and changes. So farre they were, from choosing so expedient and requisite a way, that on the contrary, by ex∣treame violence they enforced the Countries to haue recourse, to such a lawfull and speedy de∣fence, as GOD and Nature alloweth them, to be their own deliuerers out of these extremities; And to this effect, they erected a generall Con∣federacie amongst them, (but not without Roy∣all permission for what passed) making hereup∣on a new Election, for reducing the Estate, to a better order and Gouernment. Of all which things, the Estates of our Crowne of BOHEMIA, and the Countries incorporate, hauing presen∣ted the foundamentall causes and reasons, to the eye and view of the whole world, by Deducti∣ons so ample and cleare, any one not transpor∣ted with passion, but impartially waighing all the reasons, and Circumstances, hee may herein, easily and equally be able to yeeld a true iudge∣ment and censure. Yet in this place, we meane not to charge our selfe with such Inferences, much lesse also in this respect, heere to insert the rightes and immuni∣ties of the Realme, aswell in the point of Free E∣lection, as otherwise: but in this case, we referre all men, to the Information and Iustification,
which the Estates, haue diuulged and published. True it is, that the Election of a King of Ro∣manes made not long since at Franckfort, fell out at the same time. But so likewise, we very per∣fectly carry in minde, that then we perswaded, what possibly we could, not to make too much haste therein, but before all things, to take coun∣sell, for the cessation of Armes, and to appease the Warre, which now was kindled in so many partes: causing our Councellours to intimate, how it was not reasonable, therein to reject (as they did) the Deputies of the said States of Bo∣hemia, but rather so to sway and contriue in those Consulations, that by their meanes, the way might be cleare of the Interposition, which then had bene propounded to them. Though our good intentions therefore tooke no place, and that we were driuen to let the then present affaires to runne their course: Yet in all our Actes and Decrees, we expresly by our saide Councellours reserued to euery one, the priui∣ledge to him appertaining, with solemne pro∣testation that in nothing we would preiudice the Estates of this Kingdome, causing a speciall care to be had, of all that, which (according to the iudgement of our owne Consciences) con∣cerneth the Liberty, and good of the Empire;
Not as being hereunto inuited by any hope of particuler profit, seeing then we had not the least apprehension of such things as afterwards ensu∣ed: but onely in that we fore-saw such an altera∣tion and change, as euents haue now made ma∣nifest and so greatly desiring, that it might haue bene auoyded and shunn'd. Seeing therefore the Estates of BOHEMIA, and of the Countries annexed, in their generall Assembly, vnanimously, and with one consent, haue conferred their Suffrages and Election vp∣on our Person; We protest before GOD, and with a cleare Conscience, that we euer hauing liued content, with the Electorall Dignity, and such Principalities, and Countries hereditary, as God imparted to vs, we neuer of our selues a∣spired to this said Crowne: and much lesse at∣tained we thereunto, by any seductions, or stra∣tagems, euen as those Estates which Elected vs, may yeeld vndoubted witnes and testimony. As likewise wee had no reason, considering the tempestuous, and lamentable Estate, of pre∣sent affaires, but surely it had beene farre more acceptable to vs, to haue seene the Peace of that Kingdom established, and withall, the Imperiall tranquillity, preserued, and aduaunc'd. For we duely waigh and fore-see, the Charge, Perill,
and Care which will redound vnto vs, by the continuation of Armes, deuastation of Coun∣tries, and other War-like Incommodities. And there's no question but those of riper iudgement will readily conceiue, that to accept the offer of a Kingdome, standing in such like tearms, requi∣red a farre more constant resolution, then to re∣fuse a peaceable Kingdome for which notwith∣standing, some haue bene so highly extolled by Hystoriographers. Moreouer we boldly auerre, vpon the since∣rity of our Conscience, that if we could haue found out any other assured meanes, which by our refusall thereof, might incontinently haue extinguished the heate of so disastrous a Narre, and entertained and reduced the Peace publicke to his true State and existance, so that the whole Empire might haue been sufficiently assured and secured thereof: the Honours and interests of this world, should little haue preuailed with vs, but most chearfully in this case, we had refused the offer to vs made, and freely imployed our whole endeauour and power, to obtaine the said meane, of a generall Peace. Neither did we pre∣cipitantly entrude our selues, vnto this so waigh∣ty and important an affaire. For first, it was after an humble inuocation of the King of Kinges,
who giues and takes away Crownes to, & from whome he thinkes best, with zealous Supplica∣tion & Prayer (in all this) to direct and gouerne our Spirit and vnderstanding: And vppon this, after hauing communicated with our nearest & dearest Friends, maturely weighing & conside∣ring all the circumstances; we sensibly felt and perceiued in all this proceeding, the miraculous assistance and prouidence of God, who, thereto put his helping and omnipotent hand. Beholde now therfore, why we neither could nor ought to oppose herein, his diuine & holy will: And so much the lesse ought we to refuse this Impositiō, by reason we are absolutely perswaded in our owne Iudgement and vnderstanding, that the said Estates of the Crowne of BOHEMIA, and of the Countries thereto incorporate, had iust cause and reason to attempt this mutation, for the re∣establishment of their libertie and most ancient right of Election, which others went about ab∣solutely to disanull and abolish, by diuers strata∣gems & deuices. And therefore this occasion is no lesse iust, pious, & commendable, then easie to be intimated and proued by plentifull examples of Histories, both sacred and prophane. In like manner, we seeke not to detaine, or take away from any other, that which properly belongs to
him, but rather to maintaine and defend those, which defend the right of Liberty, of Priuiled∣ges, of royall Grants & Letters Patents, for a free exercise of the religion of the Gospell, and other obseruances, against an vniust & violent oppres∣sion: and to Protect these noble Countries, and so many thousands of innocent Persons from totall ruyne, so farre as God shall strengthen our arme, and enlarge vpon vs his Graces and bene∣dictions: hauing vndouted hope, that whereas our simple intentions ayme in all this, neither at Voluptuonsnes, nor pleasures, at Honours, or worldly riches; but onely at the glory of God, the comfort of the afflicted, the release of the oppressed, and at the consolation of so many de∣solate harts, whose deep sighs, sobbes and teares, vrged vs to a feeling compassion, that God our high and soueraigne Conductor will neuer for∣sake, and abandon vs, but that reiecting all vaine thoughts and cogitations of men, he will send down vnto vs from aboue, his benigne assistance and ayde, with fit and requisite meanes herein, to execute the Arrest, and Decree, of his sacred will, prouidence, and inexhaustible wisdome: where∣in, if we should come short of our duty, our con∣science would not onely be inwardly wounded, but further we should wilfully drawe vpon our
selues Gods Diuine wrath, and punishment. Moreouer also considering, that if we had re∣fused this diuine Vocation & Dignity, we could not possibly haue auoyded (especially, with all those that make profession of the Gospell) the imputation and blame, of so much blood conse∣quently shed, and of all the spoyle and waste made in the same Countries: As also if they of the contrary party, had attayned to the end of their designes (which was to suppresse the Bohe∣mian Nation) it would further mightily haue encouraged them, to employ both against our selues, and all the other Euangelicall Estates of the Empire, the Armes they had in hand, to ef∣fect that, whereunto the boyling malice of their hearts, hath hitherto excited them, both couert∣ly and openly, nay by written impressions, di∣vulged and published, not sparing little Infants, no not their owne sometimes, nor illustrious Fa∣milies, with their Countries & Subiects, as their comminations haue threatned in diuers partes: Adding further, that if there had not beene pre∣sent prouision made, and that by a preualent meanes, for the Kingdome of Bohemia, and the Countries thereunto annexed, which are one of the principall members of the Empire, and as it were a ramper against all externall Nations:
they had bene in great danger to haue fallen in∣to a Strangers hand, and finally to haue bene en∣tirely cut off, from the body of the Germaine Empire, or at least reduced to such a Condition, that they must needs haue bin the Authors of great Inconueniences, directly preiudicial to the Electors, Princes, and States Euangelicall adia∣cent: These circumstances, I say considered, we could finde out no other more conuenient way, then the present resolution we haue vndertaken. Whereunto wee were likewise obliged more nearly, by the Faith, and fidelity which we owe to the sacred Empire, through the peculiar inte∣rest of our Electorall Family, and Principality of the superiour Palatinate, and by the hereditary Alliances, which the saide Principality from all Antiquity, hath held with the Crowne of Bohe∣mia: for Protection and preseruation whereof, the fore-mentioned reasons to watch the more circumspectly, hoping that euery man well in∣form'd of the Truth, and free from all passion, will rightly iudge of our Actions, and no wayes sinisterly enterpret them. And this was the reason, why in Gods name, for the aduancement of his Glory, for the Com∣fort of the poore afflicted, for the preseruation of common prosperity, and Liberty, and other
very important occasions, at the humble, and instant request of the Estates of the Kingdome of BOHEMIA and the Countries incorporate, di∣uers times reiterated, both by writing and Em∣bassies directed to vs, as also by serious remon∣strances to vs intimated: that at last we appro∣ued of the Election of our person vnanimously made, and accepted the Crowne, and Gouerne∣ment of the Kingdome of BOHEMIA, and of the Countries annexed. And to this end, we toge∣ther with the Princesse of great BRITAINE, our deare Spouse, haue transplanted our selues vnto this City of PRAGVE, where with the common Consent and Assistance of the said Estates, we haue beene solemnly Crowned, and with great popular applause, collocated in the Royall Throne, which God by his omnipent arme, gra∣ciously confirme, and grant vs this fauour, so to begin and continue our Raigne, that the King∣dome of Iesus Christ, may still more and more, be augmented in vs, and our Subjects, and they happily, and long time, maintained in true Peace and felicitie. So that once more we protest before God and the whole world, that from this time forward, we are firmely resolu'd, not to persecute or mo∣lest, or suffer to be persecuted, or molested any
person whosoeuer, for matter of Religion, no not they, which professe themselues to be of the Romane Church, neither to trouble, or disturbe them in the exercise of their Religion, so they liue conformably to the Lawes of the States, E∣dicts of Pacification, Royall Letters, and to for∣mer publicke Grants passed in fauour of Religi∣on. As to speake truth, a good number of the saide Romane Catholicks within the Kingdome of Bohemia and the Prouinces annexed, haue voluntarily expos'd and offer'd themselues by Oath, and Subscription, to that common defen∣siue Confederation Instituted between the saide Kingdome, and Countries, and by yeelding vs their due homage, inclusiuely haue approued of our Election and Coronation. We in like manner are determin'd, to deuice all expedient and possible meanes, not onely in short time, to recouer by the grace of God, tran∣quillitie and Peace, in our Kingdome of Bohe∣mia and the Countries annexed; but further en∣tertain, & plant, some better correspondicie be∣tween the Estates and the Empire, and to pre∣uent all other Iuconueniences, so that the saide Estates, each one in his particuler, be mutually hereunto affected, and that no obstacle be inter∣pos'd, nor occasion giuen of greater troubles.
And that the sinceritie of our intentions, may more manifestly appeare, wee will euer haue a care, by all possible meanes, to embrace Amitie, correspondencie, and friendly Intelligence with all Potentates, Electors, Princes, and Estates of Christendome, but more especially with those that border and confine vpon vs: We presu∣ming no lesse of them, that they will reciprocally testifie the like to vs, assisting vs with their Counsels, and performances, against all those who out of some contray Disseigne, would ho∣stilely attempt against vs, our Kingdome and Countrey. And therefore wee request them, out of the same affection and loue, which we are ready to acknowledge towards euery one of them, in all Offices possible within our power, and vpon all occasions, they may be presented: Wee finding it fit and necessary, in the times wherein we liue, to manifest and make knowne the same to all men, by this our publicke Declaration. Giuen in our Royall Castle at Prague the 7. day of Nouember. 1619.
