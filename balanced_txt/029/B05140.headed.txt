A DECLARATION OF HIS HIGHNES COUNCILL IN SCOTLAND, For the Government thereof: Concerning His Highnes Ordinance of the 8. of August, 1654. HIS Highnesse being throughly sensible, that whatsoever Vnion of Nations is made where the true Religion is not the foundation there∣of, it will prove tottering and unstable; Hath therefore expressely commanded his Councill here to endeavour the promoting the Preaching of the Go∣spel, and the power of true Religion and Holinesse; And to take care, That the usuall Maintenance here be received and enjoyed by such Ministers as are of a holy and un∣blameable conversation, disposed to live peaceably under the present Government, and who for the Grace of God in them, and for their knowledge and utterance, are able and fit to preach the Gospel, and shall be approved, according to an Ordinance of his Highness of the eight of August, 1654. entituled, An Ordinance for the better support of the Universities in Scotland, and encouraging of Publick Preachers there; All which laying a double duty upon the said Councill, to promote the true Religion in soundnes of Faith, and holines of Conver∣sation, They shal, through the assistance of the Lord, cheer∣fully and industriously endeavor the same: but finding that the said Ordinance of the eighth of August, by reason of the not acting of most of those persons mentioned therein, hath not been put in effectual execution, whereby the good inten∣ded by his Highnes to this Nation, hath not been derived to them; they have thought fit to Declare, That as they shall give all just countenance and encouragement to the persons
who shall certifie according to the said Ordinance, and to the persons so certified of; so if they shall not proceed there∣in, but continue to delay the execution thereof, The said Councill will esteem themselves obliged (by tyes not to be dispensed withall) to promote and set forward so good and necessary a Work, in such ways as shall seem best to them to carry it on, both in discharge of their duties unto God, and obedience to his Highnesse; And that all those who are no∣minated and concerned therein, may yet have a competent time to consider how the said Ordinance may be most effe∣ctually pursued in this Iuncture of Affairs, and in order to those good Ends, which therin are proposed, the said Coun∣cil have fixed upon the first of December next, as the time be∣fore which they desire those afore-mentioned in the said Or∣dinance, would proceed thereupon when occasion is offered: And whereas there may be diverse places where some per∣sons may have a freedom and willingnesse to act upon the said Ordinance, and yet cannot actually express the same by reason no persons in their Province within that time may stand in need of, or demand such Certificates; It is there∣fore desired in such cases, that by the day above-specified, All such persons would declare their readines to act when the opportunity shalbe presented, whereby if a defect should ap∣pear for want of persons to act, the said Councill may spee∣dily take care to supply it with other fit persons who shal be willing to carry on that desired Work: And because the said Ordinance of the eighth of August, 1654. hath not yet been Printed, and containing in it some other things relating to the better support of the Vniversities, and encouragement of Publick Preachers in Scotland, The Councill conceiving it not fit to sever the parts of the said Ordinance in the pub∣lication thereof, Have appointed the whole Ordinance to be Printed herewith. Given at Edinburgh the seventeenth day of October, 1655. Signed in the Name and by Order of the Councill. BROGHILL, President.
