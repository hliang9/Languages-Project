TO THE Called of God, Who believes in the Light of the LAMBE, To be read in their Assemblyes in the Pure Dread of the Lord. DEare Children and people of the eternall God, who have known the working of his mighty pow∣er, and have been exercised in the operations of his Eternall Spirit, whereby he hath begotten your minds out of the world, in a great measure, and hath brought you into a feeling of his eternall presence, which filleth heaven and earth, wherein is the Joy unspeakable unto them that are reconciled to God by the Lord Jesus Christ, the Immortall Word: Friends, you unto me are exceeding preci∣ous, and my desires and breathings to the Lord for you, are ex∣ceeding strong, that ye may be preserved in the sence and feeling of the power of an endless life, and that you may be all kept in the true faith and obedience of the truth, which lives for ever; all minding to answer its requirings in every perticular, and waiting to feele its springings arising in you, whereby you may feele it quickning you up to God, that so your faith, and trust, and confidence may only stand in him, who is able to deliver: For Friends this know, the Lord will assuredly try you to the ut∣termost, and you must come through the fire which will consume your enemies: Therefore dear Babes be stedfast in the Lord according as he hath made manifest himselfe unto you, and waite and watch in that measure of his life in you, which only is
able to keep your minds and hearts out of the earth, and the things thereof, and as ye singly wait upon the Lord, you will feele the growth of that birth in you, which is not of this world, which can indure the fire; Oh my Friends waite to feele your growth and translation into this birth, which doth the will of the Father naturally, this is the seed unto which the promises are, this is the Elect which obtains, and cannot be deceived, this is the heir of the Kingdome without end; this will God Crowne with victory, when the measure of its sufferings is fulfilled; this feed must work through all it's enemies, and work them under it's feet; Oh waite in the eternall power to feel and witnesse it in the per∣ticular, and be patient till God bring forth his work outwardly; Look not out, neither be dismayed at the strange transactions of the times, but look to the Lord, who only can save by what means he pleaseth, and let the Lord alone to appeare as he pleaseth; on∣ly be you watchfull, that when he appeares, you may be ready for his appearance, and watch in the Light which will give you clear∣ly to see his appearance, and what he requires of you; that so living obedience unto him may be yielded: Oh Friends, Take heed that the things of this world draw not away any of your hearts: Remember it is them that are redeemed from the earth, that must reigne in, and with the Lambe upon the earth: Take heed that your love stands not in any thing, or things that is of this world; for the tryall will be great unto such: Dear hearts, I know that some of you have suffered the losse of much for his name sake already; oh faint not, neither be weary for all your suf∣ferings are knowne unto the Lord; and he will not alwayes so try you; but he will sufficiently recompence you, if ye abide to the end: Therefore watch unto prayer, and pray in the Spirit, as it moves you thereunto, that you may be kept through faith unto the end of the tryall, and that you may be prepared and made fit for the deliverance, which must come by an outstretched Arme; and when you are tryed deeply, either in prisons or otherwise, oh Friends murmure not, but feel the Lords strength to support you, that you may not bow to the enemy, in any wise, whose day is but short, and therefore he is wroth and rages; for such as bowes to any thing, but the Name of our King, verily their tor∣ment and perplexity will be exceeding miserable, when the Lord
shall deliver his chosen, who kept their integrity, and loved not their estates, nor lives, but gave up all for his name sake: There∣fore deare Friends hearken you to the voyce of the Lord, and keep you to the leadings of his eternall Spirit, and let his Dread fill your hearts. And you that feele but little sufferings and tryalls, take heed of a wrong security, and of a false ease and liberty, least the day of the Lord come upon you at unawares, and a violent storme unlookt for; and you that are in deep sufferings and tryalls, be not you cast down, but know that the tryall of your faith is ex∣ceeding precious, and if you keep your minds stayed upon the Lord, then will you learne much in such a time, and you will feele the presence of God, and the virtue of his power, inwardly refreshing you, and will feele the power of his Majesty giv∣ing you Authority sutable to the condition you are in: So as all Friends are kept in that which gives you the sence and feeling of your conditions, that principle of life will work your minds and hearts into contentednesse with the will of God, which is your sanctification; So let the bond of peace be minded in all things, for it is comely amongst Brethren. And now the God of Life and endless virtue and power watch over you, and minister unto every one of you, that which is sutable to your present conditions, and the Lord God Almighty preserve and keep you low, humble, meek, tender, innocent, upright, faith∣full and valiant, (out of the snares of the enemy) and give you peace in all your tryalls; and let the patience of his Lamb be in∣creased in you, that you may stand unmoveable upon the Rock of ages, and retaine the Life which quickens in your understandings: And the Lord God open and keepe open your discernings, that by no meanes the subtlety may beguile the simplicity in this the day of tryall: Eternal Father unto thee I commend all thy flock, that thou Father may fil them with wisdom, strength and courage, that to thy glory they may be preserved in their severall places and measures; to whom be dominion and glory everlasting for thy endless riches, for thou Lord art worthy to reigne over all; Even so come Lord God and take thy Kingdome. I the prisoner for the Lord salutes all you, who loves the appearance of Christ, in that love which abides for ever. George Fox the younger. Lambeth house the 14th of the 5th month, 1660.
SUrely it was thee O Lord, that gave bounds unto the Sea, that the floods thereof could not overwhelme thy chosen, thou canst let forth the winds and suffer a storme, and thou canst make a calm when thou pleasest, have thou the glory of all, Thou King of Saints, thou Saviour of Israel, thou canst doe whatsoever thou pleasest; therefore will we trust in thy name, neither will we feare what man can doe unto us, because thou wilt not for∣sake us, but thou wilt plead our cause in the sight of our adver∣saries, and they shall know that thou art our God, who art able to save to the uttermost; ô Lord our righteousnesse, we will praise thy name, for thy mercies indure for ever; our eyes O God are unto thee, for we have no other helper; our faith ô Lord standeth in thee, who canst not forget thy people; Thou hast re∣vealed and brought up Jacob, who wrestleth with thee, and pre∣vailes as a Prince, therefore must the blessing come; ô Lord the Birth, the Birth cryeth unto thee, thine own Elect, which long hath been oppressed; thou canst not deny thy selfe, therefore have we faith and hope which maketh not ashamed, Oh Lord how unsearchable are thy wayes; Thou hast even amazed thy people, with the depth of thy wisdome, thou only wilt have the glory of their deliverance; and therefore hast thou suffered these things to come to passe: ô Lord thou art righteous in all thy judgements, onely preserve thy people (which thou hast gathe∣red and wilt gather unto thy selfe) in the day of tryall, that so they may sing of thy Power, and magnifie thy name in the Land of the Living. G. FOX THE END. London, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, 1660.
