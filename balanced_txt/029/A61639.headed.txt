AD LECTOREM. NOn hîc Herculeae sunt cum sudore palestrae; Nullus Olympiaco in pulvere Ludus iners: Pro sadore cruor Christi de Corpore manat; Ardua pro ludo est lucta, rapina, neces. Scotica bis denis luctata Ecclesia Lustris; Penè dedit victas, lassa labore, manus. Duros passa Patres dudum, velut ame Novercas, Vi premitur; Stygia fraude subacta gemit. Constitit effraenes contra tumidasque procellas; Proque Fide steterat, dum stetit ulla fides. Nusquam cana fides nunc est; jurataque Coeli Numina, mortales, vinc'la nec ulla ligant. Credula dum nimis est, fida haec Ecclesia; vanà Spe lusâ, & rupto Foedere strata jacet: Strata tamen non tota jacet, de pulvere surgit; Auricomum tollet mox supra astra caput. Ipsa triumphalem currum Crux saeva ministrat; Sanctorum sanguis fertile semen erit. Ecce! Sacerdotum turmam Regumque Coronam Pendentem infami de trabe, Lector, habes. Cerne oculo, Heroum facies & corpora cernas; Verba audi, & videas pectora plena Deo, Hîc loquitur Princeps, magno cum Judice, Vates; Et Juvenes, Vatum spes animosa senum. Hîc Generosa cohors, Miles, Mercator, agelli Cultor, & Arte rudis, spirat ab ore Deum. Disce immortalem hinc Animam, vitamque futuram; Nulla est, pro Christo, mors male grata pio. Pro Christi Crux, est, diademate Laurea; restis, Faedere pro Sancto, est vitta, monile, decus.
READER THE LORD in great mercy, having won∣derfully and with an outstretched arm, not∣withstanding all the opposition of Sathan and earthly Principali∣ties, redeemed Scot∣land from the Power and darkness, first of Gentilism, and then of Antichristianism, by raising of some burn∣ing and shining Lights, and other Instruments fitted for that Work; Whereby the Light of the Glorious Gospel, from a very small beginning, did increase more and more, untill at length, shining with brightness and heat as the Sun in his strength, it filled the Land with knowledge, in so much that the name thereof became Jehouah Shammah, the Lord is there: And having built to Himself a house upon the foun∣dation of the Prophets and Apostles, not only sufficiently instructed with righteous Laws and Judgments for Doctrine and Worship; But also provided with all Ordinary Offi∣cers necessary in the Christian Church, and with a form of Church-Government, of his own Institution, distinct from, and without any prejudice unto the Civil Govern∣ment
of the Kingdom, Whereby the Church of Scotland, for Soundness of Faith, Purity of Worship, Excellency of Government, Freedom and Power of the Gospel, beauti∣ful Order and Unity, was not inferior to any, if not pre∣ferable to most of the Reformed Churches, and therefore was deservedly famous and esteemed amongst them: Hav∣ing also, for an hundred Years, from it's first National Esta∣blishment, preserved the same from utter overthrow, not∣withstanding the many various and renewed endeavours of men, by force and fraud, to reduce it unto the same Er∣rors, Ignorance and Superstitions, wherein it self at first lay buried, and under which others groaned; And several times revived and restored it, when by it's own Impurity, Indifferency and Formality it began to decline, or by the Treachery, Subtilty, or Violence of others it was oppress∣ed; Thereby not only disappointing, confounding, and many times ruining the Adversaries, and comforting and strengthening the faithful; But also alwayes rebuilding to Himself a Temple, the glory whereof did far excell and darken the glory of the former: And having many times engaged the whole Land to Himself, by several most so∣lemn Obligations, of voluntary Surrender and Resigna∣tion, by frequently renewed Oaths and Covenants; So that within these few Years past, there were not many per∣sons of age, of whatever degree, and not so much as one Preaching Minister in all the Land, who not only did not make publick profession of the true Reformed Religion, but also subject themselves unto the Presbyterial Form of Church Government and Discipline, & who did not (which we desire to be noted) for that effect in their own persons swear and subscribe with the hand unto the Lord, in the National Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant; In so much, that as to the publick Profession of the Truth, and almost as to the number of persons, the Church of Scot∣land was of equal extent with the Nation, and in that re∣spect,
of all other National Churches, did most resemble the old Church of the Iewes: The Lord, I say, having to the conviction and acknowledgement of our selves and others, done such great things for us, whereof we are glad, the present Apostacy, whereby Scotland's Bethel is become Beth∣aven, and the Land that was sometimes Holiness unto the Lord, is become (alas too Edom-like) the border of wicked∣ness, & an Aceldama, a Tragical Theatre of blood & persecu∣tion, ought to be unto us no less matter of Sorrow, Shame and Fear, then it is Sin in itself, & Wonder and Amazement unto others. Who can hear our Covenanted and Kindest Lord, who hateth putting away, and defieth us to shew the bill of our Mothers divorcement, who groaneth under our Backslidings, being pressed therewith as a cart full of sheaves, complaining that He is broken with our whorish hearts, and therefore declaring that He will be no more our Husband; nor we His Wife, and that His heart cannot be toward us; But that He will drive us out of His house, and love us no more, and not cover the lip for Shame? And in consequence thereof, who can behold the Fathers house, not only de∣filed, by turning it into a house of Marchandise and den of theeves, but the Temple casten down to the ground, and the Adversary in the midst thereof insultingly and scornfully set up their ensignes for signes of Triumph; And furder, behold the blood of the Saints shed like water, and their flesh given to be meat to the fowles of the heaven and beasts of the Earth, and not lament with Jeremiah? Cap. 9:1, 2, 3▪  Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the Daughter of my People. Oh that I had in the Wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my People and go from them: For they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. And they bend their tongue like their bowe for lies: But they are not valiant fr the Truth upon the Earth▪ for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me,
saith the Lord. And this will the more appear, not only if we remember the general nature of Backsliding, which is a very comprehensive Sin, importing less Love, Fear and Trust in the true God, and proclaiming more Inconstan∣cy, Unfaithfulness, and ingratitude towards Him, then sometimes is found in very Heathens towards their Idols; But also if we consider that our present Defection hath all circumstantial Aggravations in the highest degree. For it is not in things only Civil, Indifferent, or of little mo∣ment; But in things Religious, Necessary, Important and which at least in their tendency and consequence reach to the very foundation: It is not the effect of common, hu∣mane and invincible infirmity; but most free and volunta∣ry, yea wilful and deliberate: It is not done by stealth, or in a corner; but avowedly and openly in the sight of the Sun: It is not Private and Personal; but Representative and Authorized, by Acts and Proclamations of King, Parlia∣ment and Council: It is not smoothly and subtilly, but most tyrannically carried on by military violence and cruel∣ty: It is not of a few or inconsiderable Persons, but very Universal; The greatest part of all Ranks, and of some Ranks almost the whole, being some one way or other involved therein: It is not only of these, who were al∣wayes of known and professed disaffection to the Cause and Covenant of God; but also of many who sometimes being exceeding zealous themselves, and exemplary and forcible upstirrers of others therein, are now become the chief Ring-leaders theirof, and most bloody Persecuters of those who remain stedfast in the Truth: It is not in an Heathenish or Antichristian Land, or Church divided and broken with several Sects, as some others are; but even in Scotland, so clearly enlightened, for which the Lord had wrought so many wonderful works, which was under so many obliga∣tions of Oaths and Covenants to the contrary, and had been so united in the profession of the Truth: It is not from vio∣lent
force, Inevitable necessity or irresistible temptation (which is neither possible nor yet would excuse it) but when the Lord, by breaking the yoke of forrain Usurpa∣tion, had given King and Countrey the fairest opportunity which they ever had, to restore, confirm and advance His Work; as if He had delivered us, that we might work all these Abominations: And all this for no other end, then the base flattering of the Kings humor and inclination, the satiating of Prelaticall Pride and Ambition, the indulging of the licentious profanity of some Debauched & degenerated Nobles and others, who could not endure the yoke of Christ's sound doctrine and impartiall discipline, And the suppression of Religion and Righteousness in the subversion of the late work of Reformation: Whereby we have charged our selves with all the blood that hath been shed upon either side, during the former wars; Have laid a stumbling block before all, who shall see or hear of it, to blaspheme Religion as a fiction, to condemn the late Work of Refor∣mation as a false pretence for Rebellion and Self-Interest, and to affirm that there is neither truth nor ingenuity in the Professors thereof. Pass over the Isles of Chittim and see, and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing; hath a Nation changed their Gods, which yet are no Gods? But Scotland, Ah Scotland! hath chang∣ed her glory for that which doth not profit. Be astonished, O ye heavens at this, and be horribly afraid: And so much the rather, because few Lands did ever make Defection after this manner, but, as upon the one hand, the Lord gave them up unto more Backsliding, until they abounded more with Atheism and all manner of abominations, then some Pagan-Nations, who never heard nor made Profession of the Gospel; So upon the other hand, He alwayes pursued them with sorest plagues, not only of subjugation at home, scattering and exile abroad, dividing of Kingdomes amongst themselves, and from their former Rulers, and final sub∣version
of whole Empires, Kingdomes and Common-wealths; But also many times with the Final removal of the Gospel, and utter dissolution of all visible National Cove∣nant-relation, as might be demonstrated from Holy Scripture, and other Histories: And indeed, if He, to whom nothing is strange or impossible (though they may seem both to us) and whose wayes and thoughts are as far a∣bove ours, as the Heavens are above the Earth, do not in the Soveraignity of His Grace, recede from His ordinary method of dealing with such apostatizing People, and now when he hath seen our way do not heal us, we have, alas! oo too just ground of fear, that we shall become such a proverb amongst the Nations, that the generation to come of our Children, and the stranger that cometh from a far Land, when they see the plagues of this Land, shall won∣der and ask, Wherefore hath the Lord done this unto this Land? What meaneth the heat of this great anger? Oh! that the very first, and next following steps of Defection; together with the Causes of the Lord's wrath against the Land, were remembered and acknowledged, and that all who have had any accession to the kindling of this flame (and who can wholly Justify himself? If any would, be sure, his own mouth should condemn him) would draw water and pour it out before the Lord, for quenching thereof, and that the first resiclers from our National Acknowledgment of Sins and Engagement to duties, would glorify God by Confession, that he might turn from the fierceness of his An∣ger; But alas! He hath at once pour'd out upon us the Spirit of Whoredome and of a deep sleep! and hath both made us to erre from His way, and hard'ned our hearts from his fear. And as we should look bekind us to the Rise, so be∣fore us to the Result of thse things; for though every runner may read the Primum mobile of this course, the great axletree and wheels upon which all moveth, and who are the furious drivers and slavish drawers thereof, and we have
both seen the several degrees of Motion and advancement, and smarted the sad effects of the same, yet I am affray'd, that there is now another Spirit in Persons and Tendency in affairs then some men apprehend. Whether there be a suf∣ficient ground in the Holy Scriptures to think with some, that before the last fall of the Roman Antichrist, the Popish Religion shall once more overshadow the Christian World▪ is not proper here to enquire; But considering the great affinity betwixt Papacy and Prelacy, and the already au∣thorized and practized Conformity of the one to the other, not only in Government and Discipline, whereby they have, for the most part, the same Ecclesiastical Courts and Offi∣cers; But also in Worship, whereby they have the same Liturgy, for substance of Epistles, Gospels, Collects and Letany; The same Ceremonies of Rising, Standing to the East, Bowing, Kneeling, Crossing, &c. the same supersti∣tious & fool-like Vestments; The same observation of many dayes, the same adorning of Churches and Chappels, with Altars, Books, Candles, Candlesticks, Basins, Images, and Crucifix's on windows, and the same Jesuitical sign upon their pulpit cloath; And also in several points of Do∣ctrine, preached, licensed and printed, with many other things tedious to be enumerated: Considering also the constitution of the Kingdoms, which by Ignorance, A∣theisme, disputing and oppugning of the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, Error, Superstition, Profaneness, Indiffe∣rency, Formality and Hypocrisy in many, are much more then formerly disposed to embrace whatsoever shall be au∣thorized or indulged: And considering the native tenden∣cy of the present Course of Backsliding, which leadeth unto the great Whore, the mother of all these abominations, Nothing but gross, wilfull or judicial Ignorance, and e∣strangement from affairs, can deny that there is too just ground of fear, that ere long (if the Lord do not prevent it) Brittain may be again precipitated into the old gulf of
Antichristianism. And so much the rather, because it is universally observed and notourly known, that the number of professed Papists, hath increased more within these six Years, then it had for near sixty before; the conviction whereof made some of the Prelates themselves say some Years hence, that since the Year 1660. there were more thousands of avowed Papists in Scotland (compute then what may and must be in England and Ireland) then before that Year there were hundreds. Whence this is, and whether there be any positive Resolution to reintroduce Popery in these Lands, I do not affirm, but remit it to the consideration of the impartial Reader who understandeth the times, and to Time it self, a great searcher and discoverer of secrets, to declare the genuine meaning and tendency of these things, That the King should publish in print, that the Papists had been faithful Subjects to him and his Father, whilest others under pretence of Religion had in∣volved the Kingdoms in blood; Was that bloody Massacre in Ireland, whereof they were the known and acknowledg∣ed Actors, though perhaps not the only Authors, such Faithful service? That the execution of penal Statutes a∣gainst Papists should be superseded, whilst severe penal Sta∣tutes are dayly enacted and executed against Protestants, really, though not under that name and notion: That so many known and open Idolatrous Masses should be conniv∣ed at & tollerated, whilst both publick & private meetings of Protestants for pure Worship are prohibited by Law, and violently interrupted: That so many known professed Pa∣pists, Priests and Jesuites, who do not publickly counten∣ance the Prelatical Worship, are permitted to live peaceably and enjoy all their Liberties, whilst non-complying Pro∣testants, for simple Non-conformity to Prelacy, are impri∣soned, fined, confined, scourged, stigmatized, and ma∣ny otherwayes oppressed and persecuted, in their Estates, Consciences and Names: That so many Papists especially
in England should enjoy and be dayly advanced to the great∣est places of publick Power and Trust, not only as mem∣bers of Parliament, Council, and Court, but as State-Officers, Lieutenants, Sherifs, Justices of Counties, and Officers in Army, whilst stedfast Protestants, for simple non-perjuring, are some of them not so much as permitted to sit in Parliament, or any other Iudicatory; others of them discourted, disgraced, disarmed, imprisoned and proscribed, and all of them who will not forswear, de∣clared incapable of publick Power or Trust in Church or Common-wealth: That a house for Fathers or Friers is provided; whilst many faithful Ministers are removed and chased from place to place, without any certain habitation: That there should be such universal Report & so much Pre∣sumption, of a Popish hand in burning of London, which, for number and strength of Protestant Inhabitants, was the most considerable City in the World, and bulwark against the Romish Religion and designes, and yet, as if men were affrayed to try the truth in that matter, so little satisfying & effectual course taken, to try and punish the Authors and Actors, and to repress their many other insolent misdemea∣nors; whilst many thousands of innocent Protestants, who never burnt either house or City, for no other alleaged crime but their peaceable forbearance to bow to the Idol which the King hath setup, are thrown into a furnace of fiery Triall, seven times more heated then ever was known in the Chri∣stian World for such a Cause, all things being considered. It may seem strange to the Nations about, and to the Generations following, that the Church of Scotland which had been so faithful and chast, should have suffered herself to be thus prostituted, and that (if she would not other∣wayes, after the manner of her Fathers, contend for the Faith which she had receaved) she did not cry to all the World by Declarations and Protestations (as the Maid under the Law) that she was forced; And that of all the sons
which she had brought forth, there were so few, either to take her by the hand, and plead openly for her, or to plead with her, that she would put away her whoredoms. This indeed is, and ought to be for a lamentation; But let none therefore conclude (as some of the profane and perfi∣dious Prelates, measuring others after their own baseness and treachery, had the impudence at first to misrepresent to the Rulers) that all were or are consentient unto this hor∣rid Apostacy; for even at the beginning thereof, if Synods (which were then resolving to bear publick Witness for the then established Government of the Church, and against the begun Defection, and further progress thereof by the Re∣introduction of Prelacy, which was then designed) had not been, some of them, by Proclamation prohibited to conveen, and others of them violently interrupted and rais∣ed by Nobles, who, by Order of Parliament, were pre∣sent for that effect; And if some of her Watchmen (who were neither professedly driving on, nor secretly breathing after Prelacy & Prelatical promotion) had not for Reasons best known to themselves, too much courted and flattered the Powers by their own silence, and withdrawing of their necessary and required concurrence in a publick joint Testi∣mony, there wanted not Faithfulness, Zeal, Courage, Resolutions and some Endeavours in others to have emitted such Declarations, as probably might have crushed the bold attempt of the Prelates in it's infancy, and thereby have prevented much Sin and Suffering which hath ensued there∣upon, and certainly would have witnessed to all the World, that the Church without & against her consent was treacher∣ously betrayed and violently forced. Neither hath the Truth, all along from that time till this, wanted many testimonies, though none of them were so National, Uni∣versal, Authoritative and Solemn as they should have been; And few of them (perhaps) so explicite, full, plain and bold, as the weight of the matter and other circumstances
required: Yea, the continued fears of the Adversaries, expressed in the Narratives of several of their own Acts and Proclamations, and their leavying of Military Force, for upholding of them and their Cause; The Non-complyance of many thousands, their secret and open complaints and moans because of it, & their daily prayers to God against it, bear witness against this present Course. Besides, it is very observable, that some, who had been chief Authors and Active Promoters thereof and Complyers with the same, and others, who had been intimate familiars and favourers of Prelats and their Vice-curats, in Sickness and at Death did so much abhorre their way and loath their Persons, that they would not admit their presence, but called for Non-conforming Ministers to speak to them and pray for them; Yea some Gentlemen upon Death-bed, did with much sorrow bemoan their own concurrence, and particularly their taking of the Declaration against the Covenant, and seriously warned and exhorted their old Fa∣miliars and companions in that guilt to repent thereof, wishing they were able to go and make publick profession of their own Repentance; and others (whilst some friends offered to bring Prelatical men unto them) professed, that though they had sported with such men in health, yet they durst not do so at Death; and some Ministers who had con∣formed, in remorse thereof, forsook that way, and there∣after died with convincing evidence of Repentance therefore, and decaration against the same: And indeed, as there was never any Course in the Land, which so visibly had the Vo∣luntary and Active Concurse of all and Only the Wicked and Prophane; so there was never a more Universal concur∣rence and Wrestling together by prayer, of all the Godly without Exception, against any Party and Cause, then now is against this; for there needs no more to make any man (though formerly their friend and familiar) to hate their way and detest themselves, but to convince him of his
own Sin, make him thorowly apprehensive of death and Judgment, and become a sincere seeker of God, and Stu∣dent of holiness in his own Person. And further the late Rising in Armes, is an Argument above contradiction, that Prelacy is n out-landish and Unnatural weed in Scot∣land; It is true, that it had it's immediat Rise from cruell Oppression, but it is as true, that all that Oppression, was Authorised by the Rulers, Exercised by the Souldiers, and endured by the People, meerly Because and upon accompt of their Faithfulness and Stedfastness in the Covenant and Cause of God, in a non-complyance with Prelacy, other∣wise they might have lived as quyetly as others, and so soon as they were in a probable Capacity, by renewing of the Co∣venant, they declared Actively for that same Cause, for which they had suffered so much: It is true also, that the Action is condemned by some as Rebellious, and the Ende∣avour as Indeliberate, Irrational and Presumputous; But referring the Reader to the following discourse for full satis∣faction thereanent, I shall only here hint, that being al∣together accidentally occasioned, by an unforseen emer∣gent difference, betwixt 3 or 4 Souldiers and as many Countrey-men, ariseing from horrid Oppression, through unjust Lawes and cruell military execution thereof, with∣out premeditated counsel or contrivance, it cannot be imagined that all the formalities, which may be judged necessary in a matter of that nature and importance, could have been in it: And yet it is presumed, that it wanted nothing but success to have made many of the same persons account the Action just and necessary, and the Enterprize, laudable and valorous. And as for the Persons themselves, it may be truly and without all vanity affirmed. that these many years past, there hath not been in Brittain such an o∣ther Company of men joyned in Armes for the Covenant and Cause of God: for though where Armies were more numerous, there might be or was the like or greater num∣ber
of persons truly Godly; Yet where the whole number was so small, it will be very hard to parallel so many to∣gether, of sound Judgement, true Piety, Integrity of heart, fervent zeal, and undaunted Resolution and Cou∣rage, and with so small a mixture of persons of corrupt Mindes, profane Conversations and sinistrous Ends: And al∣though we would not be prodigal of mens lives, especially of Saints, at this time, when there is so great need and scarcity of intercessors, to stand between the dead and the living; yet that simple act of Renewing of the Covenant is more glory to God, and a greater Testimony and Advan∣tage to that buried Covenant and Cause, then (we hope) the loss of so many men as are faln, shall import of dam∣mage thereunto. But above all, take notice of the many Sufferings and Sufferers hereafter mentioned, whose Blood under the altar, and some of whese Heads and Hands stand∣ing betwixt Heaven & Earth, doth not only cry for Venge∣ance, but night and day bear open Witness against this A∣dulterous Geaeration. These mens Testimony should have the more weight and Credite with all, because of the Per∣sons, the Matter, and Manner thereof, which was not by Wishing, Words-speaking, or Doing without danger, which is the height of too many men's atchievment in these dayes, but by BLOOD, whereunto they resisted striving against Sin, and thereby, being neither affrayed to Act, nor ashamed to Suffer for their Lord and Master, have left behind them a fair Example of both to all, and a Reproof to many, whose greater Prudence then Zeall, hath taught them to Save themselves, by couching betwixt the burdens. That a great Prince, and yet not so Great as Good, an Eminent and more then ordinarly Useful, and never to be forgotten Instrument of the Work of Reformation and Pa∣tron of the Church, and a True & Seeing Prophet, did fall in Scotland, when Argile, Wariston and Mr Guthrey, for no other cause but their Good deeds, and particularly for Loving
of our Nation and building of our Synagogue, were led like Innocent sheep to the Slaughter, nothing but Igno∣rance, Malice, Wickedness, or Partiality can deny: for they wanted nothing to make them Beloved, as they were esteemed and Feared by their Enemies, but that they neither did nor would, because for Love and awe of God they durst not with others make Shipwrack of Faith and a Good con∣science. Of these three Mighty men, and Others who by Suffering since have obtained the Crown (though some of them, being but Countrey-Yeomen, had mean Educa∣tion, and little other Learning, thn what they learned in the Gospel of Him who is meek and Lowly, and whom the Zeall of his Fathers house did eat up, it is below their due Commendation, when it is affirmed, That never any men of the greatest Spirits, Piety and Learning, did Suffer and Die with more Meekness and Patience toward their Enemies, with more Humility and Confidence toward God, with more Faithfulness and Stedfastness in the Truth, without the least injurious reflexion thereupon, or their own adhe∣rence thereunto, with more Equability and composure of Spirit, sweetly tempered with the Sorrow's of Sin and Joyes of the Holy Ghost, in assurance of Pardon and Life Ever∣lasting, and with less perturbation of mind, and alteration of Carriage or Countenance, then these Worthies did. Here indeed was the Faith and Patience of the Saints, here did the Lord stand by and strengthen them whom others for∣sook: Yea the Lord to the Admiration of all, the conviction of many of their adversaries, the confirmation & Establish∣ment of the Cause, the Encouragement of many thousands, His own Eternall Glory, and their Immortal Commenda∣tion, did Work in the hearts of all Beholders, more ample & enduring Epistles of Commendation, then the most Elo∣quent and Pathetick Rhetorician can Writ in their Favours. This accompt further I will give yow of the first ten who died together December 7. that they once resolved to
speak severally to the People at their death; but therea considering, that for one Common Cause, and upon the same alleageances, they were all appointed to die one man∣ner of death, together at one time and in one place, and having the conveniency of being together in the Prison, they preferred to leave a word jointly behind them in writ: which as it was the cause of one conjunct Testimony, and some others severally; So the Foreseing Providence of God in this, is very observable: for had it been otherwise (seing they were not at all permitted to speak to the People upon the scaffold, there had nothing of their joint Testimony been extant, more then is of these who were not suffered to speak at their death in Glasgow, & of the rest who Suffered in othe places of the West, of whom we have heard nothing more particularly, but that the same Spirit of Glory and of God resting upon them, did work in them all▪ the same Sted∣fastness, Patience, Humility, Consolation, Courage and Confidence. These being the last times, wherein Sin aboundeth, and the love of many is waxed cold, I cannot devine what pity shall be shewed to them that are in Misery; especially con∣sidering the Universall decay of Religion, and dark cloud of prejudice and discountenance, whereby the Kingdom of Christ is overshaddowed, generally the whole world over, and even amongst the Reformed Churches: Nevertheless, there being a Communion of Saints, which should be en∣tertained amongst both Persons and Churches, whereby these of the same true Religion (amongst other things) reci∣procally give and receave information of their common affaires, that, if they can or will express no other act of Love, they may (at least) the more sutably Sympathize, and mutually pray one for another; And the Lord in his Providence, giving the opportunity, I thought it con∣venient, yea necessary, to communicat the following Deduction of the Wrestlings of the Church of Scotland for the
Kingdome of Christ, hoping, that as it beareth the Name, so, the Wrestling Church of Scotland, in due time shall reap the Blessing of NAPHTALI, who Gen. 49.21. is called a Hinde let loose, and said to give goodly words: for who can tell, but Her Wrestlings may be swallowed up of Victory and Liberty, and Her ancient Covenanted Doctrin, Worship and Government, may become as Pleasant and Acceptable, as it is Profitable, not only within herself, but also amongst the Churches abroad. This Title being only affirmative of Her, and not Negative of other Churches, as if only She, and not also They, had Wrestled for the Kingdom of Christ, let no man offend thereat: For as the Lord Redeemer hath several Offices, equally Necessary in themselves, and Inseperable by Man, and as particular Churches, as well as Persons, have their peculiar gifts and Excellencies, and accordingly their distinct work assigned unto them, whereby (amongst other things) they, more or less eminently, assert and Propugn this or that particular Truth; So in this distribution, whereas other Churches have asserted and contended for his Priestly and Propheticall Offices, the lot seemeth to have fallen upon Scotland, to assert and wrestle more eminently then many others, for the Croun and Kingdom of Jesus Christ. For the establish∣ment of this, did our first famous Reformers strive by the evidence of Holy Scripture, as well as for Soundness of Doctrine and Purity of Worship; for Preservation and Re∣stauration of this, did their Worthy Successors Zealously contend by Petitions, Warnings, Conferences and Dispu∣tations; all Invasion, Usurpation, or the least encroach∣ment upon this, di they valiantly resist by Protestations and Declinatures; and for a Testimony to this, did they patiently Suffer Bonds, Imprisonment, Confinement, Sentences of Death, and (of late) Death it self. Neither should any man think this strange, as if Presbyterial Go∣vernment were in itself Unlawful, or the Species of Church
Government, were indifferent, and consequently Con∣tending and Suffering therefore, Unwarrantable or Need∣less, as Pretenders to different Forms (upon the right and left hand) would have the World beleeve. Hithertil indeed the Church of Scotland hath heen as a Speckled bird, and the birds round about have been against her, She hath endured the scourge of many tongues, as well as the Vio∣lence of many hands, upon both hands false witnesses have laid to her charge, things which she knew not, as being (amongst other things) too Laxe or too Rigide; Yea as Unnatural Children have eaten thorow their Mothers bowels, so Unkindly Brethren have rewarded her evil for good, Standing on the other side, and looking upon her and her affliction in the day of her calamity, rejoicing over her in the day of her destruction, and speaking proudly in the day of her distress, yea laying hands on her Substance in the day of her calamity. The wrath of man worketh not the Righteousness of God, neither doth his invincible Truth need the help of humane Passions, if therefore, such men do not fear, I shall not desire, that their own tongues may fall upon them∣selves, and that the Lord may render unto them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours, but rather study the revenge of good will by Prayer, that He would open their eyes & convert their hearts, that they may take revenge on themselves. Charity, which thinketh no evil, obleegeth to beleeve, till wee see the contrary, that Scripture, Conscience, Covenant and Credite will make those who did once laudably assert, constantly propugn and adhere to the Ius Divinum of Presbyterial Government, until they publish (which none can do) as convinceing reasons of Retracta∣tion & contrary Practice: And whatever might be expected of others, Religion, Reason, Candor, Gratitude, and Policy would seem to require, that those who in their distress intreat∣ed & obtained the succesful Assistance of the Covenanted In∣terest of Scotland, & others, who owe thereunto whatever they
are, or have more then just nothing, debt, or broken for∣tunes, should have been so far from contmptuous throwing away the Covenant as an old Almnack, when, by it as a stirrup, they had mounted the saddle of Power, Promo∣tion and Riches, and from subtile dissolving the nerves, or forcible breaking the Arme of Prebytery, that they should rather have said to both as Ruth to Naom, Where thu goest, I will go; where thou lodgest, I will lodg; thy People shall be my People, and thy God my God: Where thou diest, I will die, and there will I be buried: God do so to me and more aso if ought but death part thee and me. And it may be truly said, as the Church of Scotland hath had no Detractors, but such as were Ignorant of her, or mis-informed about her, or whom Faction, Partiality, Prejudice, Wickedness or Love of unlawful Liberty did inspire; So no Person or Party hath endeavoured hithertil to root out Presbytery, but the Lord hath made it a burdensome stone unto them: And I am sure, there is no other Form of Church Government can boast of so many Testimonies by Blod as Presbyterial Government might do. But of all Contradicters, the Church of Scotland, of old and late, hath only had to do (within herself) with Prelatists, some whereof, being high flown, have pleaded a Jus Divinum, others (Antiqua∣ries) have pleaded Antiquity, and many Adiaphorists of late, being beaten from both these strengths, have pleaded Indifferency in general, and only Jus Carolinum, as to this or that Species: But as no eyes, save their own, neither these except by delusion of their sese, could ever see Pre∣lacy (that is, an Ordinary Ecclesiastical Ordr, Distinct from and Superior to that of a Preaching Presbyter, having the sole power of Ordination and Jurisdiction) in the Holy Scripture, otherwise then by Prohibition to Lord it over Gods heritage, or in the example of Diotrephes who loved Preheminence (as many famous writing, whereunto I refer the Reader, unanswerably demonstrat) & therefore,
the Office being a stranger in the Word of God, rather then the brasn Serpent which once had Divine Institution, should be Nehushtan in the Church; So let no man, Exor∣cist-wise, adjure us by the Charming words of Antiquity, Primitive times and Bishops, Fathers, &c. For Moses we know, the Prophets and Apostles we know, but what is Antiquity, and who are the primitive Bishops and Fathers? Must men be stigmatized, as giddy-headed Novellists, and as much Athenian in their Principles and Professions▪ as other mn in their Newes, or then be Im∣plicite in-tail-following Antiquaries? No, there is a Medium of proving all things, and holding that which is good: Pure Antiquity deserveth all esteem and reverence, but Simple Antiquity, as such, is neither a certain nor Safe Rule, and much less oblieging to future times, and so remote as our's are. Our Lord Himself repelleth that pretence, that it was said of old: Were there not many Errors and Corruption (which themselves will not Justify) as ancient, and early in the Church (yea more) as Pre∣lacy is alleaged to be? We are commanded to the Law and Testimony, but never to the Fathers, and good reason, because few or none of them were without gross errours in Judgment or Practice: Are not the writings of the first Age very few, or obscure? Are not many of these and after Ages lost or Corrupted? Yea other later writings are deceat∣fully emitted under the name of Ancient Times and Persons, so that in such a mist, it is hard to determine what was written by these Fathers, what not: Later, Corrupt or Inadvertant writters about these former times, did speak of Persons and things, under the abused Names which were corruptly used in thir own times: And the writtings of particular Persons (suppose of greatest Antiquity) do rather hold forth their own private Opinion, or the Practice of the Time and Place wherein they lived, then the Uni∣versal Judgment and Practice of the Church in all Times
and Places. And if they will Sanctuary themselves in primi∣tive Times, let it be cleared what is meant by Primitive; For if the two first Ages be meant, it is more then they can do, to prove by sufficient Authority, that there was then such a Prelacy, as is before mentioned, or now usurped and exercised; If after ages be meant, wherein the Church grew more corrupt, and Prelacy did aspire and exalt itself, to an Universal Supremacy in the Bishop of Rome, and establishment of that Antichristian Hierarchy, then in∣deed they are like themselves. for twins were never more like in face, then the present Prelats resemble the Romish, but then it were Candor in them, to tell plainly, that Pa∣pacy and Prelacy are of one Original, with this difference, that Prelacy is the first born, or rather the Father which begat the other; And if they mean a Middle time, be∣twixt these Periods, wherein indeed Bishops were first known in the Church, and will reckon their descent from them, why are they so unlike unto them, that they look neither like Sons nor Successors? Ask those who have dived into these depths of Antiquity, and they will tell, that a present Prelat, and a faithful Presbyterian Pastor (or Moderator at most) do little more differ, then the present Prelats and these first Primitive Bishops: For as it was long before such a thing was known in the Church, so when thorow the Malice and Subtilty of Sathan, the Ambition of some Church-men, the Unwatchfulness of others, and Indulgence of some Magistrats it did creep in, at first it was intended and acknowledged for no more, then a Prudential Humane device for greater Unity (a Cure, because with∣out warrant, worse then the desease, which, as the A∣postles never prescribed in their own times, though there were then many Divisions, so there is alike Reason to Ex∣tend further to Papal Supremacy, in the case of divisions amongst Prelats and Patriarches) and had never the im∣pudence to aspire (with some present Prelats) so high as
a Jus Divinum; At first these Primitive Bishops, being Elected by other Presbyters, with consent of the people, and not by the Civil Magistrat only, as now the Prelats are by the Kings Letter to the Dean and Chapter, were Ordained by the laying on of the hands of Presbyters, and rot of Bishops only, as the Prelats are; Their Ordination vas not Essentially different from that of Presbyters, nor to an Order distinct from, and Superior to that of Presby∣ters or Pastors, as the Consecration of the Prelats is alleaged to be; Neither did they (though perhaps they had a ne∣gative voice) usurp the sole power of Ordination and Ju∣risdiction, nor Exerce the Acts thereof, without the potestative Concurrence of Other Presbyters, as now the Prelats do; Many of them being Holy, Humble, and Sober in their conversation toward the people and other Presbyters, did nor (with the present Prelats) assume the lofty Tittles of Lordship, Grace, &c. Nor live and ride in such state and pomp, claming and taking the preference of the greatest Peeres of the Land; Ordinarly, and espe∣cially at the beginning, they had not such vast charges, as now the Prelats have Diocies over Hundreds of Pastors, and many Thousands of people, to whom it is utterly im∣possible to perform Ministerial duties; Being diligent Preachers themselves, they were not, as the Prelats are, Idle drons, nor Non-residenrs, nor yet of a strange lan∣guage to the people, as Wallace, through his ignorance of the Irish tongue, and almost of all others except his Mothers, must be a Barbarian to his Diocy of the Western-Isles▪ Neither did they involve themselves in Secular affairs and Offices, then which, what is there more absurd in Reason, and repugnant to Scriptural precept and Ex∣ample? For Christ Himself telleth us, that his Kingdome is not of this World, Joh. 18: ver. 38. and how can his Officers be of it? He refused to be a Judge, Luc. 12: 14. And, speaking to the Disciples of Civil Authority and
Dominion, saith, it shall not be So amongst yow, Mat. 20: ver. 25. Luc. 22: ver. 25: And the Apostle. Paul telleth us, that Ministerial weapons are not Carnal. 2 Cor. 10: ver. 4: And that the Ministers of the Gospel should not entangle themselves with the affairs of this Life 2 Tim. 2: ver. 4: That the Ministerial calling is so weigh∣ty, that the best qualified and most diligent is not sufficient for it, 2 Cor. 2: ver. 16. how then are they sufficient for it, and civil affairs too? And therefore they should Wa upon it, Rom. 12: ver. 7: and give themselves wholly to it. 1 Tim. 4: ver. 15. and not wait (as the Prelats do) upon Courts, Parliaments, Council, Convention of Estats, &c. as members thereof, nor Exerce the office of Provosts, Justices of peace, &c. Nor will it excuse them, that they commit Ministerial inspection of the flock to Deputs: For if they be Shepherds, should not the Shepherds feed the flock? Ezeck. 34: ver. 2. If to them be commit∣ted the Ministery, Teaching, Exhorting, should they not themselves Wait upon these? Rom. 12: 7: If they must give accompt of Souls, should they not Watch for them? Heb. 13: ver. 17: And if the Lord will require the flock at their hand. Ezek. 34: ver. 10: how will they answer to God, the people, their own Conscience (if they have any) or to others who ask a reason of them, for feeding of themselves only, and committing the flock to Others, and especially to such who are so far from being Learned, Holy, Apt to teach, Blameless, of a good report, Chast, Sober, Grave, Lovers of good men, Meek and Gentle, as the Scripture requireth, that many are Novices, Ignorant, Prophane, Light, Given to Wine, False, Covetous, Contentious, Proud, Passionat, and Self willed, and so far from taking heed to the flock, or being an Example to them, in Word, Conversation, Charity, Spirit, Faith and Purity, that they neither take heed to themselves, nor rule their own families well? I remember that one speaking of
such as commit the flock to Vicar-Curats (as all are who serve under Prelacy) saith, Adibunt per Vicarios in Para∣disum, in Persona in Inferos. They shall go to Heaven by their Deputs, but to Hell in Person. These men (if I may borrow an allusion from the duty and commendation of faithfull and approven Ministers) have taken forth the Precious from the Vile, and taught the people the diffe∣rence betwen the Holy and Profane, and caused men to discern betwen the Unclean and the Clean; but mark How, and for what End? Is it not by making sad the hearts of the Righteous, whom they have selected, and set up as the Only object of all their Malice and persecution, and Strengthening the hands of the Wicked, whom they have taken into their bosome, as their Only Familiars and Confidents. The one they thurst with the side and shoul∣der, the other they do not suffer to turn from his evill way, by promising him life. But if any desire more parti∣cular information about them, amongst other places to that purpose, let them read and consider, Ier. 23.9. to 33. and 5.31. Ezek. 34.1. to 11. and 22.25.26.28. Zeph. 3.4, Mal. 2.8.9. Mat. 23. and (as face answereth to face in water) they shall see their Call, Qualities, Doctrine, Conversation, Works and Influence amongst the people, and the Effects of all, together with their righteous Doom and Reward. He hath already made Contemptible and Base before the people, those who have corrupted the Co∣venant of Levy, and being partiall in the Law, have made many to stumble thereat, and will he not cause to cease from feeding of the flock, those who feed themselves, eat the fat and cloth with the wooll, but do not (for indeed they cannot) strengthen the deseasd, heall the sick, bind up that which i broken, bring back that which is driven away, nor seek that which is lost? They have not only turned his house of Prayer into a den of Theeves, but from them is profanness gone forth over all the Land, and seing
they deserve no more honourable Exit, will he not scourge out of his Temple, those who have sold Faith and a good Conscience for a mease of pottage? Yea seing He hath said it, we will beleeve, that He will make the false Pro∣phet and the Unclean Spirit pass out of the Land, and that these men shall bear the Wounds or marks of False Prophets, and for shame shall deny (for lies are their ordinary refuge) that ever they were prophets, And that Others, perhaps their nearest Relations, the Fathers and Mothers who begat them, shall so little esteem, regard or Pity them, that they shall accompt them unworthy to live (Ye shall not Live) And that He will again gather those that are now sorrow∣full for the solemn Assemblies, that he will search for the flock, seek that which was lost, bring back that which was driven away, bind up that which was broken, & strengthen that which was sick, by the hand of Pastors after his own Heart, who, under and after the Example of the great shepherd DAVID, shall feed them in a good pasture with Wisedome and Understanding. To all this, as well as the Curse upon them who make the blind to wander out of the way, let all the People say, Amen. Neither are they who plead an Indifferency of Forms of Government, more Scriptural or Rationall then the Former: for it seemeth equally absurd & incosinstant with the Faith∣fulness of J. Christ, who was faithfull to Him who appointed him; With the Lords way of dealing with the Jewish Church, whereunto he prescribed a Specifical and Fixed Form of Government; And with the Perfection and Plain∣ness of the Holy Scriptures, wherein all Church Assemblies, Officers, Powers, Acts, and who should Exerce the same, & every other thing necessarily belonging thereunto, which the Light of Nature doth not teach, and is not common to it with Civill Government and Order, are clearly held forth, Expressly or by necessary Consequence, in Speciall or Generall directions and warrantable Examples (as ap∣peareth
by the many debats Extant thereanent) to leave the Government of his Church Indifferent, and Arbitrarily de∣terminable and alterable, according to the will of the Civill Magistrat, or the various and mutable humours and In∣clinations of Persons, Times and Places, or the pretended conveniency of Civil Policy, as to leave Doctrin and Wor∣ship thus Indifferent, and arbitrarily determinable and variable, according to these crooked and changable rules: If Church Government must be Indifferent, and thus arbi∣trarily determinable and Ambulatory, because the Holy Scripturs do not Expressly affirme, that Presbyterial Go∣vernment is the Only Government, which should be in the Christian Church, and also Expressly declare, that it is Unalterable to the worlds end, and that the first Institution and Practice thereof, by the Apostles and their Successors in the Ministry, never was nor shall be Repealed, why may not the Civil Magistrat, or any other arrogating a power of Instituting or Altering Church Government or Officers, by Parity of reason, make many other Necessary and Practicall points of Faith, which are not more Expressly declared by the Holy Scriptures to be Unalterable Truths, then Presbyterial Government is (though all be evident enough) to be also In∣different, & arbitrarily determinable & mutable? & then fare∣wel Infant-baptisme, Womens receaving of the Lords▪ Sup∣per, & observation of the first day of the week for the Christian Sabbath, yea, farewel Law & Testimony, & more sure Word of Prophecy, whereunto we should go & take heed; & for a new Rule of Faith & Practice, welcome Humane Prudence, State-Policy, Corrupt & Changable Disposition of man, & pretend∣ed Necessity or Conveniency of State, Time & Place; yea wel∣come all Doctrins & Practices, which though they were once positively prohibited, can alleage that the Scripture doth not Expressly declare, that they never were nor shall be repealed. And where are we then? In vain is the Law, in vain is the pen of the Scribe, and every one, without transgression,
may do what seemeth good in his own eyes, if only he can Temporize, and offed not the Civil Magistrat, by viola∣tion of his Arbitrary Institutions and Lawes in Church affis, wherein he must be Supream. O my soul, come not int the secrets of such Latitudinarian, or rather (in this) Nullifidian Adiaphorists. We would not be here mistaken, as if we denyed to the Civil Magistrat any Power, which the Holy Scriptures allow unto Him; for as we assert his Office to be an Ordinance of God, and his Person (be∣ing lawfully therewith vested) to be signally impressed with a special Character of Majestick Authority, where∣fore, in a due Subordination to Him who is Lord over all, He should be subjected to and obeyed; So we chearfully grant, that, whereas the Heathen Magistrat (because of his Morall incapacity to Exerce more power) about Religi∣on and Ecclesiastical affairs, hath only a Power in Actu signao and us ad rem, the Christian Magistrat hath Ius in re, and in Actu Exercito may and should by his Lawes esta∣blish the true Religion within his dominions, and com∣mand his Subjects to make publick profession thereof; That by his Civil Sanction he may and should Ratify Ecclesiasti∣call Sentences, aggreeable to the Word of God; That anent these he may and should Exercise an Antecedent Dis∣cretive Iudgment, whereby he may not adde an Implicit approbation; That for Preaching and Propagation of the Gospel, and for nursing of Piety and Learning, he may and should provide Necessary and Convenient accommodation and encouragement, as to Persons, Places and Revenues; That for his own Information and Advice, he may call Oc∣casionall Meetings of Church Officers and others, to Con∣fer and Debate matters before him; That Pro r nata he may Convocate Ecclesiasticall Synods, to reason and conclude Church affairs according to the Scripture; That for his own Information, and for preventing of Outward Force and Inward Confusion, he may be Present therein by Himself
or his Delegats; That by his Power he may and should Defend and Encourage the Church, in the free and peace∣able Possession of all her Intrinsecall Priviledges, and all the Members thereof, in the Profession and Practice of the same; That by the same Authority he may and should re∣press Error, Heresy, Superstition, Atheisme, Blasphe∣my and Profanness, and Punish the Authors and Spreaders thereof; That in case of negligence, he may Command all, and even Ministers, to perorme their rspective duties in general, as necessity requireth; And that for Civil trans∣gressions, he may Civilly punih Ecclsiastical Persons, as well as other Subjects, according to the Law of God and Righteous Lawes of the Land: The Zealous discharge of all which, we would thankfully acknowledg to God and Man, as the Faithfull performance of that gracious Pro∣mise, that Kings shall be the Churches nursing athes. But if discontented herewith, as if all this, together with the Weighty affairs of the Common wealth, were too little work for his Transcendent Power and Abilities, and as if Jesus Christ had no Kingdom or Government, or these were not distinct from the Kingdoms and Government of the World, or though thy were, as if he were equally Head and Fountain of both, He will needs abitrarily Institut or Al∣ter, the Species of Church Government; Authorise, Ex∣authorise or Restrain Church-Officers, in the Exercise of the Power of Order or Jurisdiction, in whole or in part, as the Parliament and Councill have prohibited some Hun∣dreds the whole Exercise of their Ministry, and the High Commission (which claimeth no power, but what is solely and immediatly derived from the King) hath deprived some from the Office, & interdicted Others the administration of the Lords Supper; If he will Define Articles of Faith, and prescribe what heads of Doctrine, Ministers shall treat or not treat of in their Sermons, as the King hath done in his printed Letter to the Bishop of York; And thereupon
Primarily, Immediatly, and Antecedently to any Judg∣ment of the Church, which is the Pillar of Truth, and to which the Spirits of the Prophets are Subject, Cognosce and Determine of Ministers Doctrine, when the Church herself is willing and ready to try the Spirits; And Crimi∣nally or Capitally punish them therefore, under the pre∣tence of Treason and Rebellion, as several instances can be adduced against King and Councill in the series of our Church; If he will Ordain particular Church Censurs to to be executed against particular persons, for particular definite Ecclesiastical (alleaged) offences, leaving nothing undone by Himself in person, but the Execution of what he hath appointed, As the Parliament hath appointed Suspension and Deprivation of Ministers, for not observing the Bishops meetings, and the King in his Commission to the High Commission hath appointed Excommunication, whereas they may as well Immediatly Suspend, Deprive and Excommunicat themselves, as Appoint them to be executed in the manner specified in the said Act of Parliament and Commission; If after the example of Antichristian or Pa∣gan Nations, he will Institut and Enjoin Needless, Vain, Superstitious, Significant and Burdensome Rits in the Wor∣ship of God, as most of the Imposed Ceremonies in the Lyturgy, can be instructed be; If he will arrogate the Sole Power of convocating Ecclesiastical Synods, which is an Intrinsecall priviledg of the Church, whereof She was in Possession three hundred years before there was a Christian Magistrat in the world Authorizing it; And will Impri∣son, Confine, Condemn, and Banish Ministers, for plead∣ing and Practising this Right, as King James did not a few in and about the Year 1606. and the Present King of late, by Parliament, Council and Commissioner, did interdict all the Lawfull Assemblies of the Church, which did not derive their Power from the Abjured and Perjured Prelats; and if he will not only claim the only power of indicting
lemn Fasts and Thanksgivings, as de Facto is done these or 6 years past, but also institute a day to be Aniversarily oly for ever, which no mortal man can do; If, I say,  will thus Invade the Kingdom of Christ, confound it  the Kingdoms of the World, and equally Exerce the overnments of both, no man needs pronounce, but rather fear the Domesticall and Personall doom, Executed upon Saul and Uzziah for usurping the Priests office. How in quall dealing is it, that He who clamoureth so much of other men, and particularly Ministers wandering without their sphere, and overstretching-meddling with Civil affairs, should himself be Circumscribed and move within no Fixed sphere? Is it not enough that He have a Power Objective∣ly Ecclesiasticall, about Church affaires, but he must also have a Power Formally Ecclesiasticall, whereby he may Exerce Acts purely Spiritual, and proper to Church Offi∣cers? Will it not suffice him, that he have an Externall Power, of providing for the Church, and protecting of her from Outward Violence or Inward Disorder, but he must also have an Internall power, of Doctrin, Govern∣ment, and Disciplin, & the several Forms & Acts thereof? Is is not Sufficent that he have an Imperat Power, where∣by He may command all his Subjects, as such, to do their respective duties; but he must also have and Elicit power, whereby he may at least materially or equivalently Exerce Spirituall Acts in his own person? Will it not please him, that he have a Civil Power of Punishing Church Officers, as Subjects, for Civil transgressions, but he must also have a Spiritual Power of Censuring them for Ecclesiasticall of∣fences? Will it not content him that he have a Secundary Power of Judiciall Approbation or Condemnation of what the Church hath already found and declared to be Truth or Error, but he must also have a Primary and Im∣mediat Power of Cognition of Truth and Error, Antece∣dent to any Judgment of the Church thereanent? Will it
not satisfy him, that he have a Discretive Power, whereby he may not Implicitely Ratify Ecclesiasticall Sentences, but he must also have a Definitive Power of Authoritative Decision? And in a word, is it not enough, that he have a Cumulative Power of Confirming and Strengthening the Power and Priviledges of the Church, but he must als have a Privative Power, whereby (if he please) he may destroy the same? That the Lord hath had, and to the Worlds end will have a Church, none who beleeve the Authority of the Holy criptures can deny or question; And that he hath fixed Discriminative boundaries betwen his own and the King∣doms of the Earth (that is, betwen his Church and other Civil Societies, and their respective Governments) is no less evident: For though both consist of Men, and some∣times of the same Persons; though both have Order and Go∣vernment; a Power to Exercise the same, and that Derived from God; and the Persons invested therewith should be qualified; and in the Exercise thereof should walk Absolutely by the Rule of the Word; Punishing and Censuring after clear Conviction by Confession or Probation; And should Ultimatly aime at the Glory of God, and Good of the People; and for that effect be mutually subservient and use∣ful one to another (in these, amongst other things, they aggree) Yet they are Formally distinct: For they consist of men under distinct Notions and Relations; Civil Society and Policy is founded upon the Light and Law of Nature, Ecclesiasticall by Revealed Positive precept; The one is Common to all men as Men, the other is Peculiar to those who profess the True God; The Form of the one may be Monarchical, the other not; The object of the one is Civil, the other is Spirituall; The Nature of the one and Manner of Exerceing it, is Magisterial, the Other Ministerial; The Acts and Sentences of the one are Corporall, rhe other Spiritual; The Immediat Rule of Exerceing the one is the
awes of the Land; and the other the Word of God and cclesiastical Constitutions aggreeable thereunto; The one s performed in the Name of the Supream Magistrat, the other in the Name of Jesus Christ; The Immediat End of the one is the Good of the Common-wealth, the other the Good of Souls. Yea though the Church and Common-wealth of the Jewes, of all others that ever were, did most aggree, yet were they Formally distinct: for they had ordina∣rily distinct Rulers, the Priest and Levits for the one, Judges and King's for the other; They had distinct Acts Sacrificing, praying &c. in the Church, Death, Banishment, Confiscation, Inprisonment, Ezra 2:26. in the State; They had distinct Objects, the Matters of the Lord and the Matters of the King, 2 Chron. 19.11; Distinct Lawes, the Ceremo∣niall for the Church, the Judicial for the Common-wealth, and the Morall for both; They had sometimes distinct Members, when these of the One, were not admitted to some Priviledges of the Other; The Form of the State did alter from Judges to Kings, but the Churches was unalterably the same; And they had their distinct Periods of Duration, for the Church continued (though corrupt) after the Civil Government was overturned by the Romans. And as the Church and State of the Jewes were in these things distinct, so had they their distinct Governments, and Judicatories for Exering the same Respectively; For Exo. 24.1. there are 70. Elders, who v. 14. appear to be vested with Authority, and to have Aaron and Hur for their Presidents or Moderators; now these 70 Elders cannot be the 70, who Numb. 11. shared of the Government with Moses, for these mentioned Exod. 24. were in Authority when the Israelits were at Sinai, whereas the other men∣tioned Numb. 11. were chosen after they went from Sinai; neither can they be any other 70 in Civil Authority, be∣cause before the Election of those Numb. 11. Moses was
alone in the Government. Again Deut. 17. there are distinct causes, viz. Blood & Blood, plea and plea, which were Civill, and Stroke and Stroke, which (whether it was Leprosy) belonged to the Priests to Judge of; Lev. 13.3; Distinct Rulers. viz. the Priests the Levets, and the Iudge, who v. 11. are distinguished by the disjunctive particle Or; Distinct Acts of telling (or exponing) the Sentence of the Law, & of telling Iudgment v. 10.11, & distinct Penalties, of Death, and put∣ing the Evill from Israel, v 12. Further in  Chr. 23.4. Ye will find 6000 of the Levites who were Officers and Iudges, which must needs have been in Ecclesiastical affairs, be∣cause, 1 Chron. 28:1. there were Princes of Tribs, Cap∣tains of Thousands, Hundreds, Stewarts and Officers, for Civil affairs. And, 2 Chron. 19:8, &c. there are Church Officers, Priests, Levits, chief of the Fathers; there are distinct Matters, the Matters of the Lord and the Matters of the King. Ver. 11. There are distinct Acts or Sentences, for Warning not to trespass is more proper to Ecclesiastical then Civil Persons; And there are distinct Moderators or Presidents, Amariah is over you for the Mat∣trs of the Lord, and Zebadiah for the Matters of the King. Now what should all this mean, viz. Distinct causes, and Persons set over them to Judge them respectively, and what meaneth these distinct Acts, Sentences and Penalties, if not to hold out the Distinction of Government, and of Judicaories respectively exercing the same? Yea hat was in the Old Testament, we may know by what we read in the New, for Matth. 21: ver. 23. and 27: ver. 1. and 26: v. 3, 57, 59. Act. 4: v. 5, 6, 15. and 5: v. 21, 27. there are Assemblies & Councils, which must needs be Eccle∣siastical: not only because they consisted of Ecclesiastical persons, the High Priest, Cheef Priests and Elders of the People; Cognosced of Ecclesiastical Causes, the life, Doctrin and Authority of Christ and his Apostles; And past Ecclesiastical Sentences about preching in the Name
of Christ, Act. 4, and 5. But also because (the Jewes being subdued) the Supreme civil Government was taken out of their hands, and little left them but the Ecclesia∣stical. And if at any time, in the Old Testament, the same persons were members of both Judicatories, it was under distinct Notions and considerations, as Ecclesiastical in the one, and Civil in the Other; As now the Ruling Elder, under several Considerations and Capacities, may be a mem∣ber of an Ecclesiastical and Civil Iudicatory. It is true that the High Priests and some Kings had great hand in both Civil & Ecclesiastical affairs, but Extraordinary, and (may be) Typicall instances are not an Ordinary and Universal Rule; And it may be also, that in the New Testament these Councils meddled in Civil Affairs, for Matth. 27: ver. 1. they take counsel against Iesus to put him to death, but that was by Corrupt Abuse of their Power, which crept in, in the declining State of the Church, and when the Civil Government was taken from them by strangers, or when, wanting a Magistrat, they took more upon them then at another time; for it was not so from the beginning, and was by the like Corrupt and Ex∣travagant Abuse, as now the High Commission (if it be an Ecclesiastical Courr) doth Scourge, Stigmatize, Fine and Banish, or the Prelats now as Members of Parlia∣ment, Council, and Session, make themselves Judges of Blood, Pleas, &c. And as this was the Manner & Difference of the Jewish Church and State under the Old Testa∣ment, so under the New Testament, there is by Divine Institution, a Formal and Specifical Difference, between the Government of the Church and Common-wealth: For ye will not only find Office-bearers Given unto, and Set in the Church. Rom. 12: ver. 8. 1 Cor. 12: ver. 28. Ephes. 4: ver. 11. Which are as wel Distinct from Office-bearers of the State as from the People, for neither Magistrat nor People were ever called Apostles, Prophets▪
Evangelists, &c. especially in the Apostles sense; But also RULERS, distinct from the Rulers of the Common-wealth, who 1 Thess. 5: ver. 12. are Over the People, and Hebr. 13: ver. 17. Rule over them. Now these Ru∣lers cannot be the Magistrat, for in none of the places doth the Apostle Intend or Mention him. Besids, at that time there was not a Christian Magistrat to Rule the State, and how should the Rule of the Church be committed to a Pagan? And 1 Tim. 5: ver. 17. He that Labours in Word and Doctrin, seemeth to have more Honour, then He who Ruleth, which, if either Magistrat or Prelate be the Ruler, how they will Relish, & that the poor preach∣ing Presbyter should be more Honoured then they, let any man Iudge. Here then are Ecclesiastical Rulers, distinct from these of the Common-wealth. To these Rulers be∣longeth the Cognition of Ecclesiastical Offences, in Contra∣distinction to Civil Causes and Iudges; Matth. 18.—Tell the Church: Now the Civil Magistrat cannot be this Church, where is He ever so termed? Or how will He, (being himself a Heathen) accompt another man so: Here then is a Church distinct from the Common-wealth; here are Church-Offences distinct from Breaches of Civil or Muni∣cipall Lawes; here is Church-Delation or Complaint, distinct from any complaint to the Magistrat, tell the Church; and consequently, here is a Church-power of Cognition of these Offences, distinct from that which resids in the Magistrat, else it were in vain to tell the Church, and as good or better to tell the Magistrat; And here is a Church-Sentence, Let him be unto thee as a Heathen, which the Magistrat, being then Heathen himself, would never pro∣nounce against, or inflict as a Punishment upon another man. To these Church-Rulers also is committed not only the Power of Order, or Pastorall Administration of Word and Sacraments, but also the Power of Jurisdiction, whether Dogmatical, Diatacticall, Critical, or Exusiastical, and
not to the Civil Magistrat; And accordingly Jesus Christ, giveth the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven to Peter and not to Cesar Mat. 16.19: Ye will find Church-Assemblies, distinct from Parliaments, Convention of Estts, Senats, &c. (yea when the Magistrat was an Enemy) determining ques∣tioned Matters of Faith and Practice, Act. 15: The Apostle Paul enjoineth the Church of Corinth and not the Ma∣gistrat, both to Excommunicat and Absolve the Inces∣tuous man, 1 Cor. 5.4.5. and 2 Cor. 2.7.8: The same Apostle leaveth Titus and not the Magistrat to Ordain El∣ders in Every City. Tit. 1. v. 5; and accordingly it is per∣formed by the Presbytery, and not by the Magistrat, 1 Tim. 4.14: The Apostle Iohn thereateneth by Himself and not by the civil Magistrat, to Censure Diotrephes, 3. Iohn 10. And as the Power it self, and the several Acts thereof are Committed to Church-Officers; So to them and not to the Civil Magistrat, are all the Directions given for Regula∣tion of the Exercise thereof, distinct from the Directions given to the Magistat for Regulation of the affairs of the Common-wealth: and so in the case of Offence, there must be private rebuke before Publick delation, Mat. 18:15, 16, 17. In the case of Publick Scandal, there must be a Rebuking before all, 1 Tim. 5:20: In the case of Publick Censure, there must be Notoriety of the Fault 1 Cor. 5.1. or suffi∣cient conviction of the Person, by Confession or Probation, Mat. 18.15; In the case of Excommunication, it must be when the Church is gathered together, 1 Cor. 5.4. and not (after the Prelatical fashion) in a corner; In the case of Ab∣solution, there must be sufficient evidence of Repentance, 2 Cor. 2.7; In the case of Ordination of Ministers, there must be the Election of the People, Act. 6.3, 4, 5. Trial, 1. Tim. 3:10. & laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, 1 Tim. 4.14. and they must be Fixed to particular flocks, Tit. 1.5. How distinct are these, and all other Directions given to Church-Officers for Regulation thereof, from the directions
given to the civill Magistrat for Regulation of the Com∣monwealth? And the Church Officers, & not the civil Magistrat, are Commended or Discommended accord∣ing as they faithfully or unfaithfully Exerce this Power and follow these Directions: So the Angel of the Church of Ephesus (which I hope none will say was the Magistrat) is commended for Trying them which said they were Apost∣les and were not, Revel 2.2. It was not the Emperor, Senat, &c. that tryed these false Apostles, as of late the Parlia∣ment, Council, High Commission, ejected many Hundreds of faithful Ministers without Trial; The Angels of the Churches of Pergamus and Thyatira are discommended, for tollerating false Doctrin and Corrupt Practice, v. 14.15.20. so is the Church of Corinth blamed for not timeous Excommunicat∣ing of the Incestuous Person. 1 Cor. 5. For the like Ommissi∣ons which are reproved in these Angels, I know them who now deserve a sharper censure, sed quod defertur non aufertur. From all which, as the Formal & Specifical Difference be∣twixt the Power and Government of Church and Common wealth is aboundantly evident; So Jesus Christ Himself, & not the civil Magistrat, is the Author & Fountain of Church-Power and Government; Then which, there can be nothing more clear to them who do not wilfully shut their own eyes, or whom the God of this world hath not blinded: For, besids that Himself telleth us, that He hath receav∣ed all Power and Judgement from the Father, Mat. 28. ver. 18. Iohn. 5.22. and Iohn beareth him that Testi∣mony. Iohn 3.35. And who should derive Power to others, but He who receaved it for that end? Let us consider his Name and Relation to the Church; In what Relation he standeth to the Common-wealth or civil Magi∣strat, I do not here iquire, but the Apostle tells us, that He, and not the civil Magistrat, is Head of the Church Ephes. 1.22. and 5: 13. &, as such, he doth not only Mysti∣cally communicat inward Grace to the members, but Occo∣nomically
derive Power and Direction for the Outward Re∣gulation of the whole body. How then can the Magistrat be Head of the Church, or supream Governor in all causes Eccle∣siastical? Must the Church have two Heads, or a Head above a Head? Why may not a Church Officer or Officers, as well claim (with the Pope) to be Head of the Common-wealth? Will they shew us a Warrant from Scripture or Reason for the one, which will not as strongly plead for the other? Well then, let Christ be still Head of the Church. And as such. Ye will find Him, and not the civil Magistrat, Instituting all Church-Ordinances for Administration of Word and Sacraments, Mat. 28:19. 1 Cor. 11:23. for Excommuni∣cation and Absolution, Matt. 18:17, 18. and all other Acts of Government and Disciplin: Ye will find Him, and not the civil Magistrat. Instituting Church-Offices; He it is who gave, Ephes. 4:11. and sett in the Church, 1 Cor. 12: v. 28. Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Teachers, &c. And who is he that dare alter by addition or diminution? Ye will find Him, and not the civil Magistrat, Authorizing these Officers to Exerce the Several Acts of the Power of Order and Jurisdiction, Mat. 28:19: Ye will find Him, & not the civil Magistrat, Furnishing these Church-Officers, with Gifts and Graces for their work; as none goeth here upon their own Expences, so can any Magistrat breath the Holy Ghost, as Christ did upon his Apostles? Ioh. 20.22? In His Name, and not in name of the Magistrate, must they performe all Church-Acts; they must Assemble, Mat. 18:20. Baptise, Mat. 28:19. Excommunicat, 1 Cor. 5: ver. 4. and do all in His Name: He, and not the Ma∣gistrat, maketh Lawes Absolutely and Primarily oblieging to the Church and Church-Officers, and therefore is He called the Lawgiver, Isai. 33:22. Iam. 4:12: He, and not the civil Magistrat, will call Church-Rulers to their final Accompt; An Accompt they must give, Hebr. 13:17. & to whom but to Him that gave them Commission, and is
Iudge? Isai. 33:22: And in recognition of all this, the Apostle Paul acknowledgeth that the Lord Jesus, and not the civil Magistrat, Giveth Ministerial Power and Authority, 2 Cor. 10:8. and 2 Cor. 13, 10: And because of this, they are called the Ministers of Christ, 1 Cor. 4: 1. and Ambassa∣ders for Christ, 2 Cor. 5:20. and not of, or for the Magistrat, as now the King termeth the Prelats Our Bishops: His Ser∣vants they are, & therefore should not be Pleasers of Man, nor of the Magistrat, Gal. 1:10. as they ought to be, if he gave them Commission: If the Magistrat, as such, be Head of the Church, and Fountain of Church Power and Government, I would gladly know, how or whence the Apostles, their Successors and others in the Ministery, had power to Teach or Govern the Church, when there was no Christian Magistrat to derive Power to them? Or whether they had any Power at all, or were but Usurpers? Or what the Church shall do for Power when the Magistrat is Hea∣then, Antichristian, or a Woman, Child, a Fooll, a Tyrant, or Heretick, &c. Shall the Church all this time want a Head? Or shall the Body of Christ, have a Pagan-Head? Shall a Woman, who must not speak in the Church, be Head of the Church? shall a child or Idiot, who can∣not Govern themselves, have the External Regulation of the Church? Or shall Cruell Tyrants, who oppress or destroy the Common-wealth, and Bodies of men, have the Regulation of the Church, & of the Souls of men? We may then go to the Pope, the Turk, the wild Indian-In∣fidels and Savages, for a Head to the Church before She want; for whatver belongeth to one man, as a Magistrat, belongeth to all Magistrats: But we will hold us content with the Head, Iesus Christ, which the Father hath given us. Now from this, that Church-Power and Government are thus distinct from the Civil, and that Jesus Christ and not the Magistrat, is Author and Fountain thereof, it evidently followeth, that it is not Subordinat to the Magi∣trat.
It is true, that the Magistrat hath much Power Objec∣tively Ecclesiasticall, and that Church Officers, as Subjects, are subject to him; yet Ecclesiastical Power it-self, is not Properly Subordinat to the Civil. This will the more ap∣pear, not only because it is not Derived from the Ma∣gistrat, as the Head or Fountain thereof, nor is Exerced in his Name, but also if we consider, that Proper Subordina∣tion, is only in things flowing from the same Fountain, and of the same Nature, whereas civill and Eccesiasticall Powers are neither from the same Immediat Fountain (if the one be from Iehovah Essentially considered, and as great Lord Creator and Gubernator of the World, the o∣ther from the Lord Redeemer, Head and King of his Church) nor yet are they of the same, but different Natures, as is said before: Again, if it were properly Subordinat to the civil Power, then the Magistrat himself, might Exerce all Ec∣clesiasticall Acts, in the Administration of Word and Sa∣craments, as well as of Jurisdiction; for as nor ason can be adduced, why He may Institute or Alter Church Go∣vernment or Officers, or Exerce the External Regulation thereof, which will not by parity of strength infer his Ex∣ercing Acts of Order; So, every Superior Power includ∣ing all the Inferior. He may as well Exerce all Ecclesiastical Power, as civil, if the One be Subordinat to the Other: And further, the Magistrat himself, as a Christian, is but a Member of the Church, and Subject to Church-Govern∣ment and Discipline, though it should not be practised, except for most weighty Causes, in great necessity, and with singular Prudence, and all due Respect and Reverence to Civil Authority, and the Person therewith vestd; and accordingly many Magistrats have been censured: Yea in some cases, as if the Magistrat should unjustly forbid to Preach, Baptise, Ordain, Deprive, Excommunicat &c. the Church may Exerce Church Power without and against His consent, which She could not do, if it were Subordinat to
him. I know there are many clamours of the Absurdity and Inconsistency of two Collateral and Co-Ordinat Su∣pream Powers and Governments in one Kingdom; And indeed that Absurdity and Inconsistency may hold true, of two Supream Collaterall and Co-Ordinat Powers ejusdem Generis, but not in this case where they are diversi generis: Yea of their own Natures, they are so far from being hurtful, that, being rightly mannaged, they are singularly help∣full to one another: Neither can these two Powers and Governments in a Land, import now under the New Tes∣tament greater absurdity and Inconsistancy, then under the Old, when the Jewes had their Ecclesiastical Sanedrin, as well as civil Courts for the affairs of the Commoun∣wealth. Hence also it followeth, that as Ecclesiastical Power is not Subject to the civil; So, in matters Ecclesiasti∣cal, there should be no Appellation from the Church to the civil Magistrat: For though when Church Judicatories, without their sphere, meddle in civil Causes as such, or, for Ecclesiastical offences, inflict civil Punishments, they may be Declined as Judges Incompetent in the one case, & com∣plaint of an unjust or Heterogeneous Sentence is lawful in the other; & though the Magistrat, before He adde his Ratifi∣cation, may require a Reason of Ecclesiasticall proceedings, or, in case of an injust Sentence, may desire the Church to con∣sider the matter again; & the Church i bound thus to give a Reason, or Consider the matter, especially in a degenerat or declining time of the Church, when more is permitted to the Faithful Magistrat, then otherwise; Yet there can be no Appellation from the Church to the Magistrat in Ec∣clesiastical Causes & Sentences: Not only because all Ap∣pellations are from the Inferior to the Superior in Eodem genere, but the Church and State are not such, as is cleared before; but also because the Church is indued with Com∣pleat Power of Cognoscing & Final determining Ecclesiasti∣cal affairs, without dependance upon the State, and these
Determinations, being Just, the Lord hath promised to Ra∣tify, Mat. 18:18. And the Magistrat, having no Formal Church Power, cannot pronounce Ecclesiastical Sentence, or make Redress by Himself, & so the Appellation is in vain. Pauls Appealing to Caesar, Act. 25:11. will not help this weak cause; For He did not appeal in an Ecclesiastical cause, from an Ecclesiastical Court, to a Court of another Nature, but in a matter of alleaged Sedition, from Festus an Infe∣rior Magistrat to Caesar the Supream. Neither is the In∣stance of Ieremy stronger then the former (Ier. 26:8.9. &c) for there is no mention of His appealing from the Priests to the Magistrat, but of his Apology before the Princes, who came to hear the matter, and their Voluntary delivering him from the Uniust persecution of the Priests and Prophets, who were not competent Judges of Life and Death. Neither is the Exception of the Difference betwixt a Hea∣then and Christian Magistrat more Valid in this matter; for (besids all that is before said) in the old Testament, the Government of the Church was Committed to Church-Officers, even when the Magistrat was Religious, and why not in the New? The Government of the Church is not committed to them, because the Magistrat is Hea∣then, or upon Temporary, but upon other Moral and Immu∣table grounds, & therefore should not be taken from them when he becometh Christian: It is sure, that the Church had power given unto Her to Govern Herself, when the Magistrat was Heathen, now when and where is that Pow∣er Repealed? If Church-Govenment belong to the Chris∣tian Magistrat, then it is either as Magistrat or as Christian, if as Magistrat or as Christian, then (according to the known maxime) it belongeth to Every Magistrat, and so to the Heathen, and to Every Christian, both which are false: Was the Magistrat no Magistrat or Incompleat, when (be∣ing Heathen) he did not meddle with Church Govern∣ment?
or did the Church Usurp and Rob the Heathen Magistrat of that Power, in the Apostles dayes, and 2 or 300 years after? Shall the Church, by the promise of Nursing Fathers, have less Power and Priviledge, or be in worse Condition, by a Christian then Heathen Magistrat? And how vain i the Distinction of Outward Regulation of the Church, and Inward, (for that must be the other terme) for the Inward Regulation thereof belongs incontrovertibly to Jesus Christ, and if the Magistrat hath the Outward, what is left to the Church? These things, which, had they been formally digested, would have been more clear and convincing, are only thus confusedly and abruptly hited: nor should I have said so much, if (besids the Erastian Spirit, which, more then ever, doth now rage) some Parliamentary and Council-Expressions, and aggreeable practices, had not given occasion. Whether it be Primi∣tive or not, let the Reader Judge, but sure I am, the Kings Government of the Church and State; Charles, &c. Supream Governor in all causes as well Ecclesiasticall as Civil; The Bishops serving the King in the Church, is neither Scriptural nor Safe Dialect. Him they may serve, and Whether or How, Time will tell; but well know I, whom they do not sere in the Church: and indeed it is proper, that they who are there, only by the Will of Man, should only serve Man. His Commissioners they are, and according∣ly Sharp hath deposed some Ministers by Vertue of the Power which he hath from his Majesty, and therefore they can ex∣pect no greater Assistance, Blessing or Reward then he can give; But yet there is a greatr to whom they must give an Accompt. Having (beyond my first intention) detained Thee longer, then perhaps was Necessary, or will be Profitable or Pleasant, Thow may'st now speak with the Deduction, which is of age, & able to answere for itself, if according to the Patience, Learning & Justice of many, thow do not Re∣fute
and condemn before thow know it; or brandish big words, as he who upon a Coronation-day, offereth duell to all who question the Kings Right, when he knoweth, that (for Major Vis) none dare appear in the contrary. But in the passing take a word of the National Covenant, the Solemn League and Covenant, and Solemn Acknowledgment of Sins and Engagement unto Duties, that at one view, thow may'st see Scotlands Engagements and Breaches, the Faithfulness of many, & flood of Sin and Suf∣fering that hath overflowed the Land: Here is the Termi∣nus a Quo and ad Quem of our Backsliding, whereof, though the most skilled Artist cannot pourtray to the life the whole body (the form is so monstruous & Complexion so strange) he may well darkly represent some Lineaments of fingers and toes, that the reader may know Ex ungue leonm; yet the Author hath nervously asserted the Truth, and drawn matters of Fact, with such True Collours, that he can only be accused for a Picture fairer then the live-face of many Persons & Actions. To winde up all, be not discouraged upon the one hand nor insult upon the other, by the Death of many Mighty men of God, Co-workers and Eye witnesses of his Work, within these few years past, and the stripling-stature of many survivers, who have not attained unto the dayes of the years of the life of their Fathers, and (being but of yesterday) can know little of the Lords ancient kindness to the Land, ex∣cept what thir Fathers have told them: For as he hath reserved a numerous remnant of Holy, Learned, and Faith∣ful men, a rich cluster wherein there is a blessing, and we have reason to bless Him who gave not our Church dry breasts & a miscarrying womb; so he can make the barren bear seven, & become a Joyful mother of many Children, and as he hath work for them, will raise up both Shepherds and Principal men. It is true, alas! there is grown up a most degenerat Off-spring of all Qualities,
some whereof (and not the meanest) being as profane as Machiavel, who teacheth Rulers to keep promise and Oath no longer, then with pretended advantage they can break, and that it is a prejudice to be Really Religious, but not so honest as He, who notwithstanding affirmeth a Necessity of Seeming to be Religious, which they are not, accompt no man to be a Man, who, by Whoring, Swearing, Drinking & Spending all or more then they have, do not class themselves into their new Profane Orders, & become as Cartesian in their Religion, by Atheistical doubtings & disputings about God, the Holy Scripturs, Heaven, Hell, &c. as others are in their Philosophy. But here is an Advantage, that by Discovery, and distinguishing betwixt the pre∣cious and the vile, the Lord hath made this Defection contribut more to the Facility (as well as Necessity) of a future Purgation of the Church, then all her Judicatures could ever effectuat without it. And further, as he hath frustrated many chief Authors and Promotters thereof of their Hopes and Designs, and called Nobles, Prelats and others to an accompt before they well tasted the expected sweetness, or were warm in their Places or Promotions; So though Herod & Pilat may aggrie against the Innocent, yet where men are like Samsons foxes, only tied together by the tail of common Corrupt Principles, whilst their heads, of Self Interest and designs, look different wayes, what such a Position, Conjunction and Aspect prognosticateth, let Scripture, Reason and Experience be consulted and they will tell. Let us not, in the meantime, mistake Gods Work, Wayes, Doings nor Intentions, neither be envyous at evil doers, nor yet be Cu∣rious nor Anxious about futuritions, much less limit the Holy one, to Means, Method or Time, but bear the Indignation of the Lord because we have sinned, till he plead our cause, waiting upon him who is a God of Judgment, and waiteth that he may be gracious, and in patience possess our souls, for (though we do not) he knoweth his own thoughts toward us, it may be they are thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give an expected end, and that (when he hath ri∣pen'd Deliverance) he will bring us forth to the Light, & we shall be∣hold his Righteousness. It is a crime of the highest nature with our Rulers, to complain or supplicat for redress, Others are either of deaf ears or feeble hands and cannot help, and seeing we can do no more for the Cause and Covenant of God, for our Mother-Church, the Land, Ourselves, Our Brethren & Posterity, let us open our cause to him who tryeth the Righteous. O Lord Hear, O Lord Forgive, O Lord hearken and do: Defer not for thine own sake, O my God: For thy City and thy People are called by thy Name, AMEN.
The Testimony of MR JAMES WOOD, Minister of the Gospel, and Professor of Theo∣logy in the University of S. Andrewes, for Presbyterial Government. I MR JAMES WOOD, being now shortly (by appearance) to render up my Spirit to the Lord, find my self obliged to leave a word behind me, for my just Vindication before the World. It hath been said of me, that I have (in word at least) re∣seiled from my wonted Zeal for Presbyterial Government, ex∣pressing my self concerning it, as if it were a matter not to be accounted of, & that no man should trouble himself in the matter & practice thereof. It is true, being under sicknes, I have some times said, I was taken up with weightier matters, then any ex∣ternal ordinance, and what wonder I said so? being under such wrestling annt my interest in Iesus Christ, which is a matter of for greater concernment. Surely any Christian in this Church that knows me, will judge there is a wrong done to me: For since the day that the Lord convinced my heart (which was by a strong hand) that it was the Ordinance of God, appointed by Iesus Christ, for governing & ordering his visible Church, I never had the least change of thoughts, concerning the necessity of it, nor of the necessity of the use of it. And now I declare before God & the World, that I account so of it still: And that however there be some more precious ordinances, yet that this is so precious, that a true Christian is obliged to lay down his life for the profession thereof, if the Lord shall see it meet to put him to the tryal. And for my self, if I were to live, I would account it my glory, to seal this word of my testimony with my blood. Of this my decla∣ration, I take God, Angels and Men to be my witnesses, and have subscribed thi presents with my hand, the 2 of March 1664. about 7 hours afternoon, before Mr William Tullidaf and Mr John Carstairs, my Brother in Law, and John Pit∣carn, writer hereof. MR JAMES WOOD.
AS the Matter of this Testimony is very considerable, especially from so Great a man as Mr Wood was; So the occasion & consequents thereof are very observable, which were thus: Mr Sharp, having formerly been intimately familiar with Mr Wood, came to visite him under his Sickness (whereunto Sharps Apostacy had no small accession) & thereafter did falsely spread a report by word & writ, that Mr Wood had reseiled from Presbyterial Government. Whereof when Mr Wood was informed, he was of new grievously affected and afflicted, and thereupon, for his own Vindication, left this Testimony behind him. But Mr Sharp finding himself thereby made a publlck lyar, (making lyes still his refuge) pursueth Mr Wood being dead, as well as alive, with a new slander, alleaging his Testimony to be Fictitious, or Extorted from him, when, through distemper of his sickness, he knew not what he did, and thereupon caused summond the Witnesses▪ the Writter and some other persons before the High Commission: But the contrary of this was and is most Evident, not only because this Te∣stimony was written and subscribed, a considerable number of dayes before his Death, dureing which intervall (as before) he was so composed, that he spake many gracious words about his own soul, Ordered his Civil affairs, and a famous Physician was not without hopes of his Recovery; But also because, hearing that some of his faithful Brethren & Co-Presbyters were in the town, he sent once & again for them, and before them, and some other Ministers at other times, purged himself of that unjust Imputation, and did bear witness for Presbyterial Government more fully & freely then is in the written Testimony, & some time thereafter, of his own accord did call for the Writter, & (there being none other present in the chamber at the be∣ginning) did indite and cause him writ the same, as it now is without any Alteration; as also in a Letter written some considerable time be∣fore, (inviting Mr Carstairs to come and visite him) he had made mention of the Backsliding, Tryalls and Sufferings of the times, and expressed his desire to Live, that he might give a more free Testimony to the Truth. Notwithstanding all which, Mr Sharp (obstructing the reading of a Letter written by Mr Carstairs to the Chancelor, containing and clearing the matter of fact) persisted with great Attestations before the High Commission, in his former false alleagance, and Slandering both of the Dead and the Living, and caused im∣prison the Writer and one of the witnesses, and forced the other (whom, for his eminent Parts, Holiness and Faithfulness, he most pursued) to a Retirement for his own safety. What shall be given to Thee O Sharp! Or what shall be done to Thee; O false Tongue? Sharp arrows of the Mighty and Coals of Juniper.
The Nationall Covenant, OR The Confession of Faith of the Kirk of Scotland, subscribed at first by the Kings Majesty and his Houshold, in the yeare 1580. Thereafter, by Persons of all rankes, in the yeare 1581, By ordinance of the Lords of the Secret Coun∣cill, and Acts of the general Assembly. Subscribed againe by all sorts of Persons in the Yeare 1590, By a new Ordi∣nance of Council, at the desire of the General Assembly: With a General Band for maintenance of the true Religion & the Kings Person. And now subscribed in the Year 1638. By Us, Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Mi∣nisters, and Commons, then under-subscribing: Together, with our resolution and promises for the causes after speci∣fied, To maintaine the said true Religion, and the Kings Majesty, according to the Confession foresaid, and Acts of Parliament. And now, upon the Supplication of the Gene∣ral Assembly to His Majesty's high Commissioner, and the Lords of his Majesty's Honorable Privy Council, subscribed again in the Year 1639. by Ordinance of Council, and Act of General Assembly. The Tenor whereof here followeth. WE All, and every one of Us underwritten, Protest, that, after long and due Examina∣tion of our owne Consciences, in matters of true & false Religion, We are now throughly resolved of the Truth, by the Word and Spirit of God; and therefore we believe with our hearts, confess with our mouths, subscribe with our hands, and constantly affirme before God, and the whole Word, that this onely is the true Christian Faith and Religion, pleasing
God, and bringing Salvation to man, which now is by the mercy of God revealed to the world, by the preaching of the blessed Evangel, and receav∣ed, believed, and defended, by many and sundry notable Kirks and Realmes, but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland, the Kings Majesty, and three estates of this Re∣alme, as Gods eternall Truth, and onely ground of our Salvation: as more particularly is expressed in the Confession of our Faith, stablished, and publick∣ly confirmed by sundry Acts of Parliament, and now of a long time hath beene openly professed by the Kings Majesty, and whole body of this Realme both in Burgh and Land. To the which Confession and forme of Religion, wee willingly agree in our con∣sciences in all points, as unto Gods undoubted Truth and Verity, grounded onely upon his written Word. And therefore, we abhorre and detest all contrary Re∣ligion, and Doctrine: But chiefly, all kinde of Pa∣pistry, in generall and particular heads, even as they are now damned and confuted by the Word of God, and Kirk of Scotland: but in special we detest and refuse the usurped authority of that Roman Antichrist upon the Scriptures of God, upon the Kirk, the civill Magi∣strate, and conscience of men, All his tyrannous lawes made upon indifferent things against our Christian li∣berty, His erronious Doctrine, against the suffi∣ciency of the written Word, the perfection of the Law, the office of Christ, and his blessed Evangel. His corrupted Doctrine concerning originall sinne, our naturall inability and rebellion to Gods Law, our Ju∣stification by faith only, our imperfect Sanctification and obedience to the Law, the nature, number and use of the Holy Sacraments. His five bastard Sacra∣ments, with all his Rites, Ceremonies, and false
Doctrine, added to the ministration of the true Sacra∣ments without the Word of God. His cruell judge∣ment against Infants departing without the Sacra∣ment: his absolute necessity of Baptisme: his blasphe∣mous opinion of Transubstantiation, or reall presence of Christs body in the Elements, and receiving of the same by the wicked, or bodies of men. His dispen∣sations with solemne Oathes, Perjuries, and degrees of Mariage forbidden in the Word: his cruelty against the innocent divorced: his divellish Masse: his bla∣sphemous Priesthood: his profane Sacrifice for the sinnes of the dead and the quick: his Canonization of men, calling upon Angels or Saints departed, wor∣shipping of Imagery, Relicts, and Crosses, dedi∣cating of Kirks, Altars, Dayes, Vowes to creatur∣es; his Purgatory, Prayers for the dead, praying or speaking in a strange language, with his Processions and blasphemous Letany, and multitude of Advocates or Mediators: his manifold Orders, Auricular Con∣fession: his desperate and uncertaine Repentance; his general and doubtsome Faith; his satisfactions of men for their sinnes: his Justification by works, opus ope∣ratum, works of Supererogation, Merits, Pardons, Peregrinations, and Stations: his holy water, bap∣tising of Bells, conjuring of Spirits, crossing, saning, anointing, conjuring, hallowing of GODS good creatures, with the superstitious opinion joyned therewith: his Worldly Monarchy, and wicked Hierarchy: his three solemne vowes, with all his shavelings of sundry sorts, his erronious and blou∣dy decrees made at Trent, with all the subscribers and approvers of that cruell and bloudy Band, conjured against the Kirk of GOD: and finally, wee detest all his vaine Allegories, Rites, Signes and Traditions,
brought in the Kirk, without or against the Word of GOD, and Doctrine of this true reformed Kirk, to the which we joyne ourselves willingly, in Do∣ctrine, Faith, Religion, Discipline, and use of the Holy Sacraments, as lively members of the same, in Christ our Head: promising and swearing by the Great Name of the Lord our GOD, that we shall continue in the obedience of the Doctrine and Discipline of this Kirk, and shall defend the same according to our voca∣tion and Power, all the dayes of our lives, under the pains contained in the Law, and danger both of Body and Soul, in the day of GODS fearful Judgment: And seeing that many are stirred up by Sathan, and that Roman Antichrist, to promise, sweare, subscribe, and for a time use the Holy Sacraments in the Kirk de∣ceitfully against their own Consciences, minding there∣by, first, under the external cloak of Religion, to corrupt and subvert secretly GODS true Religion within the Kirk, and afterward, when time may serve, to become open enemies and persecutors of the same, under vain hope of the Popes dispensation, devised a∣gainst the Word of GOD, to his greater confu∣sion, and their double condemnation in the day of the LORD JESUS. Wee, therefore, willing to take away all suspicion of hypocrisy, and of such double dealing with GOD and his Kirk, Protest, and call The Searcher of all hearts for witnesse, that Our mindes and hearts, do fully agree with this our Confession, Promise, Oath and Subscrip∣tion, so that Wee are not moved for any wordly respect, but are persuaded onely in our Consciences, through the knowledge and love of Gods true Religion, print∣ed in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, as we shall an∣swer to him in the day, when the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed. And because we perceave that the quietness and stability of our Religion and Kirk, doth depend upon the safety & good behaviour of the Kings Majesty, as upon a comfortable Instrument of Gods mercy, granted to this Countrey, for the maintain∣ing of this Kirk, and ministration of Justice amongst us, we protest and promise with our hearts under the same Oath, Hand-writ, and Pains, that we shall de∣fend his Person and Authority, with our goods, bo∣dies and lives, in the defence of Christ his Evangel, Liberties of our Country, ministration of Justice, and punishment of iniquity, against all enemies within this Realm, or without, as we desire our GOD to be a strong and merciful defender to us in the day of our death, and coming of our Lord Iesus Christ: To whom with the Father. and the Holy Spirit, be all Honour and Glory Eternally. Like as many Acts of Parliament not onely in general do abrogate, annull, and rescind all Lawes, Statutes, Acts, Constitutions, Canons, civil or munici∣pall, with all other Ordinances and practique penal∣ties whatsoever, made in prejudice of the true Reli∣gion and Professours thereof; Or, of the true Kirk-discipline, jurisdiction, and freedome thereof; Or in favours of Idolatry and Superstition; Or of the Pa∣pisticall Kirk: As Act. 3. Act. 13. Parl. 1. Act. 23. Parl. 11. Act. 114. Parl. 12. of King Iames the sixt, That Papistry and Superstition may be utterly suppres∣sed according to the intention of the Acts of Parliament repeated in the 5. Act. Parl. 20. K Iames 6. And to that end they ordaine all Papists and Priests to be punished by manifold Civill and Ecclesiastical pains, as adver∣saries to Gods true Religion, preached and by Law established within this Realme, Act. 24. Parl. 11. K.
Iames 6. as common enemies to all Christian govern∣ment, Act. 18. Parl. 16. K. Iames 6. as rebellers and gainstanders of our Soveraigne Lords Authority, Act. 47. Parl. 3. K. Iames 6. and as Idolaters. Act. 104. Parl. 7. K.

true Religion, and fostering of great errour among the people, and ordaines the users of them to be punished for the second fault as Idolaters, Act 104. Parl. 7. K. Iames 6. Like as many Acts of Parliament are conceaved for maintenance of GODS true and Christian Religion, and the purity thereof in Doctrine and Sacraments of the true Church of God, the liberty & freedom there∣of, in her National, Synodal Assemblies, Presbyteries, Sessions, Policy, Discipline and Jurisdiction thereof, as that purity of Religion and liberty of the Church was used, professed, exercised, preached and confess∣ed according to the reformation of Religion in this Realm. As for instance, The 99. Act. Parl. 7. Act. 23. Parl. 11. Act. 114. Parl. 12. Act. 160. Parl. 13. of King Iames 6. Ratified by the 4. Act. of King Charles. So that the 6. Act. Parl. 1. and 68. Act. Parl. 6. of King Iames 6. in the Yeare of God 1579. declares the Ministers of the blessed Evangel, whom GOD of his mercy had raised up, or hereafter should raise, agreeing with them that then lived in Doctrin, and Administration of the Sacraments, and the People that professed Christ, as he was then offered in the Evangel, and doth com∣municate with the Holy Sacraments, (as in the re∣formed Kirk's of this Realm they were publickly admi∣nistrat) according to the Confession of Faith, to be the true and Holy Kirk of Christ Jesus within this Realm, and decerns and declares all and sundry, who either gainsayes the Word of the Evangel, received and ap∣proved, as the heads of the Confession of Faith, professed in Parliament, in the Yeare of God 1560. specified also in the first Parliament of King Iames 6. and ratified in this present Parliament, more particularly do specify, or that refuses the administration of the Holy
Sacraments, as they were then ministrated, to be to members of the said Kirk within this Realme, and true Religion, presently professed, so long as they keep themselves so divided from the society of Christs body: And the subsequent Act. 69. Parl. 6. of K. Iames 6. de∣clares, That there is none other Face of Kirk, nor other Face of Religion, then was presently at that time, by the Favour of GOD established within this Realme, which therefore is ever stiled, Gods true Religion, Christs true Religion, the true and Christian Religion, and a perfect Religion, Which by manifold acts of Parliament, all with∣in this realme are bound to subscribe the articles there∣of, the Confession of Faith, to recant all doctrine & er∣rours, repugnant to any of the said Articles, Act. 4. & 9. Parl. 1. Act. 45.46.47. Parl. 3. Act 71. Parl. 6. Act 106. Parl. 7. Act 24. Parl. 11. Act 123. Parl. 12. Act 194. and 197. Parl. 14. of K. Iames 6. And all Magistrats, Sherifs, &c. on the one parte are ordained to search, apprehend, and punish all contraveeners; For instance, Act 5. Parl. 1. Act 104. Parl. 7. Act 25. Par. 11. K. Iames 6. And that not∣withstanding of the Kings Majesty's licences on the con∣trary, which are discharged & declared to be of no force in so farre as they tend in any wayes, to the prejudice & hinder of the execution of the Acts of Parliament against Papists & adversaries of true Religion, Act. 106. Parl. 7. K. Iames 6. On the other part in the 47. Act. Parl. 3. K. Iames 6. It is declared and ordained, seeing the cause of Gods true Religion, and his highnes Authority are so joyned, as the hurt of the one is common to both: and that none shal be reputed as loyall and faithfull sub∣jects to our Soveraigne Lord, or his Authority, but be punishable as rebellers and gainstanders of the same, who shall not give their Confession, and make their profession of the said true Religion, and that they who
after defection shall give the Confession of their Faith of new, they shall promise to continue therein in time comming, to maintaine our Souveraigne Lords Au∣thority, and at the uttermost of their power to fortify, assist, and maintaine the true Preachers and Professors of Christs Evangel, against whatsoever enemies and gainestanders of the same: and namely (against all such of whatsoever nation, estate, or degree they be of) that have joyned, and bound themselves, or have assisted, or assists to set forward, and execute the cruell decrees of Trent, contrary to the Preachers and true Professors of the Word of God, which is repeated word by word in the Article of Pacification at Perth the 23 of Februar. 1572. approved by Parliament the last of Aprile 1573. Ratified in Parliament 1587. and related, Act 123. Parl. 12. of K. Iames 6. with this addition, that they are bound to resist all treasonable uproars and hostilities raised against the true Religion, the Kings Majesty, and the true Professors. Like as all Liedges are bound to maintaine the King Majesty's Royal Person▪ and Authority, the Autho∣rity of Parliaments, without the which neither any lawes or lawful judicatories can be established. Act 130. Act. 131. Parl. 8. K. Iames 6. and the subjects Liberties, who ought onely to live and be governed by the Kings lawes, the common lawes of this Realme allanerly, Act 48. Parl. 3. K. Iames the first. Act. 79. Parl 6. K. Iames the 4. repeated in the Act 13 1. Parl. 8. K. Iames 6. Which if they be innovated or prejudged, the commission anent the union of the two Kingdoms of Scotland and England, which is the sole Act of the 17. Parl. of K. Iames 6. declar∣es such confusion would ensue, as this Realme could be no more a free Monarchy, because by the funda∣mentall lawes, ancient priviledges, offices and liber∣ties
of this Kingdome, not onely the Princely Autho∣rity of his Majesty's Royal discent hath been these many ages maintained, but also the peoples security of their Lands, livings, rights, offices, liberties, and digni∣ties preserved, and therefore for the preservatien of the said true Religion, Lawes, and Liberties of this Kingdome, it is statute by the 8. Act Parl. 1. repeated in the 99. Act Parl. 7. Ratified in the 23. Act Parl. 11. and 114. Act Parl. 12. of K. Iames 6. and 4. Act of K. Charles. That all Kings and Princes at their Coronation and reception of their Princely Authority, shall make their faithfull promise by their solemne oath in the presence of the Eternal God, that, enduring the whole time of their lives, they shall serve the same Eternal God to the ut∣termost of their power, according as he hath required in his most Holy Word, contained in the old and new Testament. And according to the same Word shall maintain the true Religion of Christ Jesus, the preach∣ing of his Holy Word, the due and right ministra∣tion of the Sacraments now receaved and preached within this Realme (according to the Confession of Faith immediately preceeding) and shall abolish and gainstand all false Religion contrary to the same, and shall rule the people committed to their charge, accord∣ing to the will and command of God, revealed in his foresaid Word, and according to the laudable Lawes and Constitutions received in this Realme, no wayes repugnant to the said will of the Eternall God; and shall procure, to the uttermost of their power, to the Kirk of God, and whole Christian people, true and perfite peace in all time coming: and that they shall be careful to root out of their Empire all Hereticks, and enemies to the true worship of God, who shall be convicted by the true Kirk of God, of the foresaid
crimes, which was also observed by his Majesty, at his Coronation in Edinburgh 1633. as maybe seene in the order of the Coronation. In obedience to the Commandment of GOD, con∣forme to the practice of the godly in former times, and according to the laudable example of our Worthy and Religious Progenitors, & of many yet living amongst us, which was warranted also by act of Councill, com∣manding a general band to be made and subscribed by his Majesty's subjects, of all ranks, for two causes: One was, For defending the true Religion, as it was then reformed, and is expressed in the Confession of Faith abovewritten, and a former large Confession established by sundry acts of lawful generall assemblies, & of Parliament, unto which it hath relation, set down in publick Catechismes, and which had been for ma∣ny years with a blessing from Heaven preached, and professed in this Kirk and Kingdome, as Gods un∣doubted truth, grounded only upon his written Word. The other cause was, for maintaining the Kings Ma∣jesty, His Person, and Estate: the true worship of GOD and the Kings authority, being so straitly join∣ed, as that they had the same Friends, and common enemies, and did stand and fall together. And final∣ly, being convinced in our mindes, and confessing with our mouthes, that the present and succeeding ge∣nerations in this Land, are bound to keep the foresaid nationall Oath & Subscription inviolable, Wee Noble∣men, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers & Com∣mons under subscribing, considering divers times be∣fore & especially at this time, the danger of the true re∣formed Religion, of the Kings honour, and of the pu∣blick peace of the Kingdome: By the manifold inno∣vations and evills generally conteined, and particularly
mentioned in our late supplications, complaints, and protestations, Do hereby professe, and before God, his Angels, and the World solemnly declare, That, with our whole hearts we agree & resolve, all the dayes of our life, constantly to adhere unto, and to defend the foresaid true Religion, and (forbearing the prac∣tice of all novations, already introduced in the matters of the worship of GOD, or approbation of the cor∣ruptions of the publicke Government of the Kirk, or ci∣vil places and power of Kirk-men, till they be tryed & allowed in free assemblies, and in Parliaments) to la∣bour by all meanes lawful to recover the purity and li∣berty of the Gospel, as it was stablished and professed before the foresaid Novations: and because, after due examination, we plainely perceave, and undoubtedly believe, that the Innovations and evils contained in our Supplications, Complaints, and Protestations have no warrant of the Word of God, are contrary to the Articles of the Foresaid Confessions, to the intenti∣on and meaning of the blessed reformers of Religion in this Land, to the above written Acts of Parliament, & do sensibly tend to the re-establishing of the Popish Religion and Tyranny, and to the subversion and ruine of the true Reformed Religion, and of our Liberties, Lawes and Estates, We also declare, that the Fore∣said Confessions are to be interpreted, and ought to be understood of the Foresaid novations and evils, no lesse then if every one of them had been expressed in the Foresaid confessions, and that we are obliged to detest & abhorre them amongst other particular heads of Pa∣pistry abjured therein. And therefore from the know∣ledge and consciences of our duety to God, to our King and Countrey, without any wordly respect or induce∣ment, so farre as humane infirmity will suffer, wish∣ing
a further measure of the grace of God for this effect, We promise, and sweare by the Great Name of the Lord our GOD, to continue in the Profession and Obe∣dience of the Foresaid Religion: That we shall defend the same, and resist all these contrary errours and cor∣ruptions, according to our vocation, and to the utter∣most of that power that GOD hath put in our hands, all the dayes of our life: and in like manner with the same heart, we declare before GOD and Men, That we have no intention nor desire to attempt any thing that may turne to the dishonour of GOD, or to the diminution of the Kings greatnesse and authority: But on the contrary, we promise and sweare, that we shall, to the uttermost of our power, with our meanes and lives, stand to the defence of our dread Sove∣raigne, the Kings Majesty, his Person, and Authori∣ty, in the defence and preservation of the foresaid true Religion, Liberties and Lawes of the Kingdome: As also to the mutual defence and assistance, every one of us of another in the same cause of maintaining the true Religion and his Majesty's Authority, with our best counsel, our bodies, meanes, and whole power, against all sorts of persons whatsoever. So that whatsoever shall be done to the least of us for that cause, shall be taken as done to us all in genearal, and to every one of us in particular. And that we shall neither directly nor indirectly suffer our selves to be divided or with∣drawn by whatsoever suggestion, allurement, or ter∣rour from this blessed & loyall Conjunction, nor shall cast in any let or impediment, that may stay or hinder any such resolution as by common consent shall be found to conduce for so good ends. But on the con∣trary, shall by all lawful meanes labour to further and promove the same, and if any such dangerous & divisive
motion be made to us by Word or Writ, We, and eve∣ry one of us, shall either suppresse it, or if need be shall incontinent make the same known, that it may be time∣ously obviated: neither do we fear the foul aspersions of rebellion, combination, or what else our adversa∣ries from their craft and malice would put upon us, seing what we do is so well warranted, and ariseth from an unfeined desire to maintaine the true worship of God, the Majesty of our King, and peace of the Kingdome, for the common happinesse of our selves, and the posterity. And because we cannot look for a blessing from God upon our proceedings, except with our Profession and Subscription we joine such a life & conversation, as beseemeth Christians, who have renewed their Covenant with God; We, therefore, faithfully promise, for our selves, our followers, and all other under us, both in publick, in our particular families, and personal carriage, to endeavour to keep our selves within the bounds of Christian liberty, and & to be good examples to others of all Godlinesse, So∣bernesse, and Righteousnesse, and of every duety we owe to God and Man, And that this our Union and Conjunction may be observed without violation, we call the living GOD, the Searcher of our Hearts to witness, who knoweth this to be our sincere Desire, and unfained Resolution, as we shall answere to JE∣SUS CHRIST, in the great day, and under the pain of Gods everlasting wrath. and of infamy, and losse of all honour and respect in this World, Most humbly beseeching the Lord to strengthen us by his ho∣ly Spirit for this end, and to blesse our desires and pro∣ceedings with a happy successe, that Religion and Righteousnesse may flourish in the Land, to the glory of GOD, the honour of King, and peace and com∣fort
of us all. In witnesse whereof we have subscribed with our hands all the premisses, &c. The Article of this Covenant, which was at the first Subscription, referred to the determination of the General Assembly, being determined, and there∣by the 5 Articles of Perth, the Government of the Kirk by Bishops, the Civill places and Power of Kirk∣ment, upon the reasons and grounds contained in the Acts of the General Assembly, declared to be unlaw∣ful within this Kirk, we subscribe according to the de∣termination foresaid. A Solemn League and Covenant For Reformation, and Defence of Religion, The Honour and Happiness of the King, and the Peace and Safety of the three Kingdoms of Scotland, England, and Ireland. WE Noblemen, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Citi∣zens, Burgesses, Ministers of the Gospel, and Commons of all sorts in the Kingdoms of Scotland, Eng∣land and Ireland, by the providence of GOD living under one King, and being of one reformed Religion, Having before our eyes the glory of GOD, and the advancement of the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the Honour and Happinesse of the Kings Majesty and his Posterity, and the true publick Liber∣ty, Safety, and Peace of the Kingdoms, wherein every ones private condition is included; And calling to minde the treacherous and bloody Plots, Conspira∣cies, Attempts and Practices of the Enemies of GOD against the true Religion and Professours
thereof in all places, especially in these three Kingdoms, ever since the Reformation of Religion, and how much their rage, power and presumption are of late, and at this time increased and exercised; whereof the deplor∣able estate of the Church and Kingdom of Ireland, the distressed estate of the Church & Kingdom of England, and the dangerous estate of the Church and Kingdom of Scotland are present and publick testimonies: We have now at last (after other means of Supplication, Remonstrance, Protestation and Suffering) for the preservation of our selves and our Religion from utter ruine and destruction, according to the commendable practice of these Kingdoms in former times, and the ex∣ample of GODS People in other Nations, after mature deliberation, resolved and determined to enter into a mutuall and solemn League and Covenant: Wherein we all subscribe, and each one of us for him∣self, with our hands lifted up to the most high GOD, do Swear, 1. That we shall sincerely, really and constantly, through the grace of GOD, endeavour in our seve∣ral places and callings, the preservation of the Reform∣ed Religion in the Chuch of Scotland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government, against our common Enemies; The Reformation of Religion in the Kingdoms of England and Ireland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government, according to the Word of GOD, and the example of the best Reformed Churches; And shall endeavour to bring the Churches of GOD in the three Kingdoms, to the nearest conjunction and Uniformity in Religion, Confession of Faith, Form of Church-government, Directory for Worship and Catechizing; That we and our Posterity after us, may, as Brethren, live in
Faith and Love, and the Lord may delight to dwell in the midst of us. 2. That we shall in like manner, without respect of persons, endeavour the Extirpation of Popery, Prela∣cy (that is, Church-government by Arch-bishops, Bishops, their Chancellours and Commissaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Arch-deacons, and all other Ecclesiasticall Officers depending on that Hierarchy) Superstition, Heresy, Schism, Prophanesse, and what∣soever shall be found to be contrary to sound Doctrine, and the power of Godliness; Lest we partake in other mens sins, and thereby be in danger to receive of their plagues; And that the Lord may be one, and his Name one in the three Kingdoms. 3. We shall with the same sincerity, reality and con∣stancy, in our severall vocations, endeavour with our estates and lives mutually to preserve the Rights and Priviledges of the Parliaments, and the Liberties of the Kingdoms; And to preserve and defend the Kings Majesty's Person and Authority, in the preservation and defence of the true Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdoms; That the world may bear witnesse with our consciences of our Loyalty, and that we have no thoughts or intentions to diminish his Majesty's just power and greatnesse. 4. We shall also with all faithfulnesse endeavour the discovery of all such as have been, or shall be Incen∣diaries, Malignants, or evil instruments, by hinder∣ing the Reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his people, or one of the Kingdoms from another, or making any faction, or parties amongst the people contrary to this League and Covenant, That they may be broughr to publick triall, and receive con∣digne punishment, as the degree of their offences
shall require or deserve, or the supream Judicatories of both Kingdomes respectively, or others having power from them for that effect, shall judge conve∣nient. 5. And whereas the happinesse of a blessed Peace between these Kingdoms, denyed in former times to our Progenitors, is by the good Providence of GOD granted unto us, and hath been lately concluded, and settled by both Parliaments, We shall each one of us, according to our place and interest, endeavour that they may remain conjoyned in a firme Peace and Uni∣on to all Posterity, And that Justice may be done upon the willfull Opposers thereof, in manner expressed in the precedent Article. 6. We shall also according to our places and callings in this Common cause of Religion, Liberty, and Peace of the Kingdoms, assist and defend all those that enter into this League and Covenant, in the maintaining and pursuing thereof; And shall not suffer our selves directly or indirectly by whatsoever combination, per∣swasion or terrour, to be divided and withdrawn from this blessed Union and conjunction, whither to make defection to the contrary part, or to give ourselves to a detestable indifferency or neutrality in this cause, which so much concerneth the Glory of GOD, the good of the Kingdoms, and honour of the King; But shall all the dayes of our lives zealously and constantly continue therein, against all opposition, and promote the same according to our power, against all Lets and Impediments whatsoever; And, what we are not able our selves to suppresse or overcome, we shall reveale and make known, that it may be timely prevented or removed: All which we shall do as in the sight of GOD.
And because these Kingdoms are guilty of many sins, and provocations against GOD, and his Son Jesus Christ, as is too manifest by our present distresses and dangers, the fruits thereof, We professe and declare before GOD, and the world, unfained desire to be humbled for our own sins, and for the sins of these Kingdoms, especially that we have not, as we ought, valued the inesteemable benefit of the Gospel, that we have not laboured for the purity and power thereof, and that we have not endeavoured to receive Christ in our hearts, nor to walk worthy of him in our lives, wich are the causes of other sins and transgressions so much abounding amongst us. And our true and unfained purpose, desire, and endeavour for ourselves, and all others under our power and charge, both in publick and in private, in all dutyes we owe to GOD and man, to amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the example of a real Reformation; That the Lord may turn away his wrath, and heavy indig∣nation, and establish these Churches and Kingdoms in truth and Peace. And this Covenant we make in the presence of Almighty GOD the Searcher of all hearts, with a true intention to peform the same, As we shall answer at that great Day when the secrets of all hearts, shall be disclosed; Most humbly beseeching the Lord, to strengthen us by his Holy Spirit for this end, and to blesse our desires, and proceedings with such suc∣cesse, as may be deliverance and safety to his people, and encouragement to other Christian Churches groan∣ing under, or in danger of the yoke of Antichristian Ty∣ranny, or to joyn in the same, or like Association & Co∣venant, To the Glory of GOD, the enlargement of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and the peace & tranquillity of Christian Kingdoms, and Common-wealths.
A Solemn Acknowledgement of publick Sins and Breaches of the Covenant; AND A Solemn Engagement to all the Duties contained therein, namely thse which do in a more speciall way relate unto the dangers of these times: ANNO 1648. WE Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers of the Gospel, and Commons of all sorts within this Kingdom, by the good hand of GOD upon us, taking in serious consideration the many sad afflictions and deep distresses wherewith we have been exercised for a long time past, and that the Land after it hath been sore wasted with the Sword and the Pestilence, and threatened with Famine, and that shame and contempt hath been poured out from the Lord against many thousands of our Nation, who did in a sinful way make War upon the Kingdom of England, contrary to the Testimony of his Servants and desires of his People, and that the remnant of that Army re∣turning to this Land have spoiled and oppressed many of our Brethren, and that the Malignant party is still numerous, & retaining their former principles, wait for an opportunity to raise a new and dangerous War, not only unto the rending of the bowells of this Kingdom, but unto the dividing of us from England, & overturn∣ing of the work of God in all the three Kingdoms: And considering also that a cloud of calamities doth still hang over our heads, & threaten us with sad things to come, We cannot but look upon these things as from the Lord, who is righteous in all his wayes, feeding us with the bread of tears, and making us to drink the waters of affliction, untill we be taught to know how
evil and bitter a thing it is to depart away from him, by breaking the Oath and Covenant which we have made with him, and that we may be humbled before him by confessing our sinne, and forsaking the evil of our way. Therefore being pressed with so great necessities and straits, and warranted by the word of God, and having the example of Gods people of old, who in the time of their troubles, and when they were to seek delivery and a right way for themselves, that the Lord might be with them to prosper them, did humble themselves before him, and make a free and particular confession of the sins of their Princes, their Rulers, their Captains, their Priests and their people, and did engage them∣selves to do no more so, but to reform their wayes and be stedfast in his Covenant; And remembring the practise of our predecessours in the year 1596. Where∣in the General Assembly, and all the Kirk-judicatories, with the concurrence of many of the Nobily, Gentry, and Burgesses, did with many tears acknowledge be∣fore God the breach of the National Covenant, and engaged themselves to a Reformation, even as our pre∣decessors and theirs had before done in the Generall Assembly and convention of Estates in the year 1567. And perceiving that this duty, when gone about out of conscience and in sincerity, hath alwayes been attended with a reviving out of troubles, and with a blessing and successe from Heaven; We do humbly and sincerely in his sight, who is the searcher of hearts, acknowledge the many sins and great transgressions of the Land; We have done wickedly, our Kings, our Princes, our No∣bles, our Judges, our Officers, our Teachers, and our People: Albeit the Lord hath long and clearly spok∣en unto us, we have not hearkened to his voice; Albeit he hath followed us with tender mercies, we have not
been allured to wait upon him and walk in his way; And though he hath stricken us, yet we have not griev∣ed; Nay though he hath consumed us, we have re∣fused to receive correction; We have not remembred to render unto the Lord according to his goodnesse and according to our own vows and promises, but have gone away backward by a continued course of back∣sliding, and have broken all the Articles of that solemn League and Covenant which we swore before God, Angels and men. Albeit there be in the land many of all ranks, who be for a Testimony unto the Truth, and for a name of joy and praise unto the Lord, by living godly, studying to keep their garments pure, and being stedfast in the Co∣venant and Cause of God; Yet we have reason to ac∣knowledge that most of us have not endeavoured with that reality, sincerity and constancy, that did become us, to preserve the work of Reformation in the Kirk of Scotland; Many have satisfied themses with the pu∣rity of the Ordinances neglecting the power thereof; yea, some have turned aside to crooked wayes destru∣ctive to both. The prophane, loose and insolent car∣riage of many in our Armies, who went to the Assist∣ance of our BRETHREN in ENGLAND, And the tamperings and unstraight dealing of some of our Commissioners and others of our Nation in London, the Isle of Wight, & other places of that Kingdom, have proved great lets to the work of Reformation, and setling of Kirk-Government there, wherby Errour and Schism in that Land have been encreased, and Se∣ctaries hardened in their way. We have been so far from endeavouring the extirpation of Prophannesse, and what is contrary to the power of godlinesse, that prophanity hath been much winked at, and Prophane
persons much countenanced & many times employed, until iniquity and ungodlinesse hath gone over the face of the land as a flood; Nay, sufficient care hath not been had to separate betwixt the precious and the vile, by debarring from the Sacrament all ignorant and scan∣dalous persons according to the Ordinances of this Kirk. Neither have the Priviledges of the Parliaments and Liberties of the Subject been duly tendered, But some amongst our selves have labored to put into the hands of our King an arbitrary and unlimited power destructive to both, And many of us have been accessory of late to those means and ways, whereby the freedom and pri∣viledges of Parliaments have been encroached upon and the Subjects oppressed in their Consciences, per∣sons and Estates: Neither hath it been our care to avoid these things which might harden the King in his evill way; But upon the contrary he hath not onely been permitted, but many of us have been instrumentall to make him exercise his power in many things tending to the prejudice of Religion and of the Covenant, and of the Peace and safety of these Kingdoms; Which is so farre from the right way of preserving his Majesty's Person and Authority, that it cannot but provoke the Lord against him unto the hazard of both, Nay under a pretence of relieving and doing for the King whilst he refuses to do what was necessary for the house of God, some have ranversed and violated most of all the Arti∣cles of the Covenant. Our own Consciences within, and Gods judge∣ments upon us without do convince us, of the manifold willfull renewed breaches of that Article, which con∣cerneth the discovery and punishment of Malignants, whose crimes have not onely been connived at but dis∣pensed
with and pardoned, and themselves received unto intimate fellowship with our selves, and entrusted with our Counsels, admitted unto our Parliaments, and put in places of Power and Authority, for manag∣ing the publick affaires of the Kingdome, Whereby in Gods justice they got at last into their hands the whole power and strength of the Kingdome, both in judica∣tories and Armies, And did imploy the same unto the enacting and prosecuting an unlawful Engagement in warre against the Kingdome of England, Notwith∣standing of the dissent of many considerable members of Parliament, who had given constant proof of their integrity in the cause from the beginning, of many faithful testimonies and free warnings of the servants of God, of the Supplications of many Synods, Presby∣teries and Shyres, and of the Declarations of the Generall Assembly and their Commissioners to the contrary: Which ingagement as it hath been the cause of much sinne, so also of much misery and calamity unto this Land, and holds forth to us, the grievousnesse of our sinne of complying with Malignants, in the greatnesse of our judgement, that we may be taught never to split again upon the same rock, upon which the Lord hath set so remarkable a Beacon. And after all that is come to passe unto us because of this our tres∣passe, and after that grace hath been shewed unto us from the Lord our God, by breaking these mens yoke from of our necks, and putting us again into a capacity to act for the good of Religion, our own safety, and the Peace and safety of this Kingdowe, should we again-break his Commandment and Covenant, by joyning once more with the people of these abominations, and taking into our bosome those Serpents which had for∣merly stung us almost unto death: This as it would
argue great madnesse and folly upon our part, So no doubt, if it be not avoided. will provoke the Lord against us to consume us untill there be no remnant nor escaping in the Land. And albeit the Peace and Union betwivt the King∣doms be a great blessing of God unto both and a Bond which we are obliged to preserve unviolated, And to endeavour that justice may be done upon the opposers thereof; Yet some in this Land, who have come under the Bond of the Covenant, have made it their great study how to dissolve this Union, and few or no endeavours have been used by any of us for punishing of such. We have suffered many of our Brethren in severall parts of the Land to be oppressed of the common Ene∣my without compassion or relief; There hath been great murmuring and repining because of expense of means and pains in doing of our duty; Many by per∣swasion or terror have suffered themselves to be divided and withdrawn to make defection to the contrary part; Many have turned off to a detestable indifferency and neutrality in this cause, which so much concerneth the glory of God and the good of these Kingdoms; Nay many have made it their study to walk so, as they might comply with all times and all the revolutions thereof. It hath not been our care to countenance, encourage, intrust and employ such onely, as from their hearts did affect and mind Gods Work; But the hearts of such many times have been discouraged, and their hands weakened, their sufferings neglected, and themselves slighted, and many who were once open enemies and alwayes secret underminers contenanced and employed; Nay even those who had been looked upon as Incendiaries, and upon whom the Lord had
set marks of desperate Malignancy, falshood & deceat were brought in, as fit to manage publick affaires; Many have been the lets and Impediments that have been cast in the way to retard and obstruct the Lords work, and some have keeped secret, what of themselves they were not able to suppresse and over∣come. Besides these and many other breaches of the Ar∣ticles of the Covenant in the matter thereof, which it concerneth every one of us to search out and acknow∣ledge before the Lord, as we would wish his wrath to be turned away from us; So have many of us failed exceedingly in the manner of our following and pursu∣ing the duties contained therein, not onely seeking great things for our selves, and mixing of private inter∣ests and ends concerning our selves and friends and fol∣lowers, with those things which concern the publick good, but many times preferring such to the Honour of God and good of his cause, and retarding Gods work until we might carry alongs with us our own interests and designes. It hath been our way to trust in the means and to rely upon the arm of flesh for suc∣cesse, Albeit the Lord hath many times made us meet with dispointment therein, and stained the pride of all our Glory, by blasting every carnall confidence unto us: We have followed for the most part the counsels of flesh and blood, and walked more by the rules of policy then Piety, and have hearkened more unto men then unto God. Albeit we made solemn publick profession before the World of our unfained desires to be humbled be∣fore the Lord for our own sinnes, and the sinnes of these Kingdoms, especially for our undervaluing of the inestimable benefit of the Gospel, and that we
have not laboured for the power thereof, and received Christ into our hearts, and walked worthy of him in our lives, and of our true and unfained purpose, desire and endeavour for our selves, and all other under our power and charge both in publick and private, in all dutyes which we owe to God and man to amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the exam∣ple of a reall Reformation, that the Lord might turn away his wrath and heavy indignation, and establish these Kirks and Kingdoms in truth and peace, Yet we have refused to be reformed, and have walked proudly and obstinatly against the Lord, not vlueing his Gospel, nor submitting our selves unto the obe∣dience thereof, not seeking after Christ, nor studying to honour him in the excellency of his person, nor employ him in the vertue of his offices, not making conscience of publick Ordinances, nor private nor secret duties, nor studying to edify one another in love. The ignorance of God and of his Son Jesus Christ prevailes exceedingly in the Land; The greatest part of Masters of families amongst Noblemen, Ba∣rons, Gentlemen, Burgesses and Commons neglect to seek God in their families, and to endeavour the the Reformation thereof; And albeit it hath been much pressed, yet few of our Nobles and great ones ever to his day could be perswaded to perform family duties themselves and in their own persons; which makes so necessary and useful a duty to be misregarded by others of inferior rank; Nay many of the Nobili∣ty, Gentry, and Burrows who should have been examples of Godlinesse and sober walking unto others, have been ring-leaders of excesse and rioting. Al∣beit we be the Lords people engaged to him in a solemn way, yet to this day we have not made it our study
that judicatories & Armies should consist of, and places of power and trust be filled with men of a blamelesse and Christian conversation, and of known integrity and approven fidelity, affection and Zeal unto the cause of God, but not onely those who have been neutrall and indifferent but disaffected and Malignant, and others who have been prophane and scandalous have been intrusted; By which it hath come to passe that judicatories have been the seats of injustice and ini∣quity, aad many in our Armies by their miscarriages have become our plague, unto the great prejudice of the cause of God, the great scandall of the Gospel, and the great increase of loosenesse & prophanity through∣out all the Land. It were impossible to reckon up all the abominations that are in the Land, but the Blas∣pheming of the name of God, swearing by the Creatures, prophanation of the Lords Day, unclean∣nesse, drunkennesse, excesse and rioting, vanity of apparrel, lying and deceit, railing and cursing, ar∣bitrary and uncontrolled oppression, and grinding of the faces of the poor, by Landlords and others in place and power, are become ordinary and common sinnes; And besides all these things, there be many other transgressions, whereof the Land wherein we live are guilty: All which we desire to acknowledge and to be humbled for, that the world may bear witnesse with us, that Righteousnesse belongeth unto God, and shame & confusion of face unto us as appears this day. And because it is needfull for these who find mercy not onely to confesse but also to forsake their sinne, Therefore that the reality and sincerity of our repent∣ance may appear, We do Resolve and solemnly in∣gage our selves before the Lord, carefully to avoid for the time to come all these offences, whereof we have
now made solemn publick acknowledgement, and all the snares and tentations which tend thereunto: And to testifie the integrity of our resolution herein, and that we may be the better enabled in the power of the Lords strength to perform the same, We do again Re∣nue our Solemn League and Covenant, Promising hereafter to make conscience of all the duties whereun∣to we are obliged in all the heads and Articles thereof, particularly of these which follow. 1. Because Religion is of all things the most excel∣lent and precious, The advancing and promoving the power thereof against all ungodlinesse and profanity, The securing and preserving the purity thereof against all error, heresy and schisme, and namely Independency, Anabatisme, Antinomianisme, Arminianisme, Socinia∣nisme, Familisme, Libertinisme, Scepticisme, and Era∣stianisme, and the carrying on the work of uniformity shall be studied & endeavoured by us before all world∣ly interests, whether concerning the King or our selves, or any other whatsomever. 2: Because many have of late laboured to supplant the liberties of the Kirk, we shall maintain and defend the Kirk of Scotland, in all her liberties and priviledges, against all who shall oppose or undermine the same, or encroach thereupon under any pretext whatsomever. 3. We shall vindicat and maintain the liberties of the Subjects, in all these things which concern their consciences, persons and Estates. 4. We shall carefully maintain and defend the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and avoid every thing that may weaken the same, or involve us in any measure of accession unto the guilt of those who have invaded the Kingdom of England. 5. As we have been always Loyall to our King, so we shall still endeavour to give unto God that which is Gods, and to Caesar
the things which are Cesars. 6. We shall be so farre from conniving at, complying with, or contenanc∣ing of Malignancy, injustice, iniquity, prophani∣ty and impiety, that we shall not onely avoid, and discountenance those things, and cherish and encou∣rage these persons, who are zealous for the Cause of God, and walk according to the Gospel; But also shall take a more effectuall course then heretofore in our respective Places and Callings, for punishing and suppressing these evils, and faithfully endeavour that the best and fittest remedies may be applyed for taking away the causes thereof, and advancing the knowledge of God, and Holinesse and Righteousnesse in the Land: And therefore in the last place, as we shall earnestly pray unto God that he would give us able men fearing God, men of truth and hating covetousnesse to judge and bear charge among his people, so we shall according to our Places and Callings Endeavour that Judicato∣ries and all places of power and trust both in Kirk and State may consist of, and be filled with such men as are of known good affection to the cause of God, and of a blamelesse and Christian conversation. And because there be many, who heretofore have not made conscience of the oath of God, but some through fear, others by perswasion and upon base ends and humane interests have entered thereinto, who have afterwards discovered themselves to have dealt deceit∣fully with the Lord, in swearing falsly by his name, Therefore we, who do now renew our Covenant in re∣ference to these duties, and all other duties contained therein, Do in the sight of him who is the searcher of hearts, solemnly Professe that it is not upon any poli∣tique advantage or private interest or by-end, or because of any terror or perswasion from men, or hypocriti∣cally
and deceitfully, that we do again take upon us the oath of God, But honestly and sincerely and from the sence of our duty, And that therefore denying our selves and our own things and laying aside all self inte∣rest and ends, We shall above all things seek the ho∣nour of God, the good of his Cause and the wealth of his people, and that forsaking the counsels of flesh and blood, and not leaning upon carnall confidences, we shall depend upon the Lord, walk by the rule of his word, and hearken to the voice of his servants: In all which professing our own weaknesse We do earnestly pray to God who is the father of mercies through his Son Jesus Christ, to be merciful unto us, and to enable us by the power of his might, that we may do our duty unto the praise of his Grace in the Churches. Amen. The occasion of this Acknowledgment and Engagement was this; THE Commission of the General Assembly 1648. considering the many breaches of the Solemn League and Covenant (and par∣ticularly by the Engagement in War that Year against England) The Slackness of many in following the duties therein, And that many, (being under age when it was first sworn) had not been receaved into the same, did, by their Act October 6. ordain it to be renewed with this Solemn Acknowledgment of Sins & breaches, and Engagement to duties, And to that effect, appointed two solemn Fasts to be keeped in all the Congregations of the Land, for the Causes contained in the Acknow∣ledgment of Sins, And that intimation thereof should be made to the people upon the Sabbath before, & that the Covenant, together with the former Acknowledgment of Sins and Engagement to duties, should be read publickly to the People, upon the day of the Intimation, and the last Fast day when the Covenant was to be sworn. This resolution of the Commission, upon the same grounds was unanimously approven by the Committee of Estats then sitting, and by their Act October 14. Or∣dained to be put in Execution, in all things according to the directions of the Commission: And accordingly in the moneth of December, it was for the second time sworn in all the Congregations of the King∣dome,
upon the same day, (except where vacancy or the Ministers be∣ing under scandal or process did occasion a delay till another day, that the place was supplyed by another Minister) with great Solemnity, and such mixture of Joy & Sorrow as became people entering in Covenant with the Lord, And was thereafter Subscribed by all the Swearers. After ward, the Parliament Conveening, in January 1649 by their very first Act except the Election of their President, upon the same grounds, Resolved to keep a Fast by themselves, for the Causes con∣tained in the Acknowlegment, and to Renew the Covenant accord∣ing to the Order of the Commission, which was also most solemnly done. And last of all the Generall Assembly 1649. by their Act, July 7. did unanimously and expresly Ratify the Proceedings of the Commission, as to the Acknowledgment of Sins, Engagement to dueties, the Fasts, and Renewing of the Covenant by Swearing and Subscribing thereof. Hence, as the Covenant it self, so the Solemn Acknowledgment of Sins & Engagement to duties became National Authorised by the Supream Judicatures of Church and State and are still obliging by Oath. Oh! that the Lord had kept these things in the Imagination of the thought of our hearts for ever. ERRATA.

A True and short DEDUCTION Of the WRESTLINGS of the CHURCH of SCOTLAND, For the KINGDOM of JESUS CHRIST, From the beginning of the Reformation of Religion, unto the Year 1667. AFter all these great & glorious things, which the Lord in his Love, Mer∣cy and Faithfulness hath wrought for this Land, and in his Holiness and Righteousness hath declared amongst us; these clear and powerfull Mani∣festations of his blessed Truth, which have so brightly shined forth, to the Glory, Beauty and Praise of this whole Nation: After these many sacred and most solemn Engagements, whereby, in the evidence and power of the same Truth, all Ranks and degrees, from the King even to the meanest, be∣came,
and are still bound and devoted to the Most High and Holy, Our Covenanted God, and to our blessed Lord Jesus Christ, (who alone is King in Zion and of all Saints, and whose are all the Kings and Kingdomes of the Earth,) for the advancement of his Glory and King∣dome, and for the owning and maintaining of his glo∣rious Work and precious Truth, which is all our Fe∣licity and Joy: And after all this horrid Apostacy and Rebellion, whereby the same wretched Nation, in the same Generation, and almost in the same Persons, neither from the conviction of any pretended Reason or Con∣science, nor from any solid persuasion of the very Ad∣vantage designed▪ but in the manifest Spirit of Wicked∣ness and violence, have forgotten, despised and blas∣phemed the former power and Glory; Rebelled against God, by breaking the Holy Covenant; Rejected our Lord and Saviour; Overturned the Work of his own blessed Spirit and Arme; Abrogated and rescinded all these righteous Lawes and Ordinances, whereby it was established; And by most Unjust, Arbitrary and Cru∣el Lawes and Practises, have endeavoured the rebuild∣ing and promoving of the Kingdome of Darkness and Antichrist, and precipitating of all men, either into the same condemnation with themselves, or utter ruine and Extermination; After, we say, all these things, which the Lord hath thus wrought and permitted in the midst of us, neither the Discouragement and Fainting of some, nor the Unsuccesfulness of the more honest and Zealous endeavours of others, nor yet our Silence hithertil, is greatly to be wondered at. For, whose eyes can behold all these things, without Dim∣nes and affecting of the heart? And whose heart can consider them, without Astonishment and Horrour, if not Stupefaction or Discouragement? How little
wonder is it, that every visage (suppose of the fairest Nazarit) be blacker then a coale? That every eye run down with waters? & that the souls of many refuse to be comforted, & neither do, nor dare rejoice as other people? When not only, by their going a whoreing from the Lord, their dayly bread, is become the bread or Adversity and the waters of Affliction, and when their famine of the Word of the Lord is such, that though they wander from sea to sea seeking it, they cannot find it; Bot also the Comforter that should releeve their souls is far from them, and either covereth Himself with a cloud, that their prayers cannot pass through▪ or then answereth them, only by terrible things in Righteousness; How can they, who by their Vanities have moved the Holy God to Jealousy, and thereby have provoked their Rock to fell them, stand before their Enemies, or chase a thousand & put ten thousand to flight? & alhough that we should plead with our Mother, with our Rulers, & with all other ranks of persons within the Land, that they would put away their whoredomes out of their sight, & their Adul∣teries from betwen their breasts; yet what hope is there, that Words shall prevaill, where the Power and Glory of the most High is contemned? Or that Reason shall be heard, where the Counsell of God is re∣jected? Here indeed is matter of Wonder and Praise, even the Longsuffering of the Lord, (which is Salvation) and the Mercy and faithfulness of our God, who hath not only hithertil preserved a Remnant, even a holy seed, which shal be the substance of our Land; But (after this late suddain and astonishing stroak of his holy Indignation, which seemed to presage no less, then the woful overturning of this sinking Church, into the depth of all darkness, and the dreadful overthrow of
this whole Land and Nation, in the consummation of his fierce anger, to have been poured out in our desola∣tion) hath made Light and Salvation to arise, and Glory and Praise to spring forth, in making his grace more manifest and commending and asserting His Work and Covenant, more in the Sufferings and Death of His faithfull Servants and Witnesses, then in all the prosperity and Victories, which formerly he vouchsaved upon us. O! blessed and exalted be his most Holy Name and aboundant Grace, who for the wicked and momen∣tany rejoycing of our adversaries, hath given to his People, such sweet consolations and Exuberant Praise; and from the depths of our present distresses, and amidst the feares of so imminent and great judgments, hath, in stead of an Apology before the world▪ put a song of Salvation in our Mouth, that, as well to Testify for the Lord against the backsliders, as for the comfort and consolation of all who love and wait for his Salvation, we may call the Heavens to hear and the Earth to give ear, that we may publish the Name of the Lord, and ascrib Greatness to our God, whose work is perfect, and all his wayes Iudgment; A God of Truth, and without Iniquity, Just and Right is He. We have corrupted ourselves, our spot is not the spot of his Children, we are a perverse and crooked generation: Do we thus requit the Lord, O foolish people and un∣wise? Yet is not He our Father that hath bought us? Hath not He made us and established us? Let us then remember the dayes of old, when the most High did visit us, and the Lord became Our God, and we be∣came His People and Inheritance. This is the Testi∣mony of his dying withnesses, this is the voice of his present Dispensations. We will therefore call to mind the Years of the right hand of the Most High, and
the wondrous works of the Lord, which He al∣one did work in our Land: We will also declare our manifold Engagements, and our most selemn and sacred Covenants, with and to Our God; that the Lord's Loving Kindness may be made known; that the Innocency, Strength and Joy of his Servants may appear; that the glory of all his Righteous Judg∣ments, which are either already come upon us, or which we have reason to fear, may be made manifest; that wickedness may stop it's mouth; and that all the Enemies of the Lord may be confounded. It is not here intended to resume these debates, which, as the Adversaries have formerly moved, and pertinaciously maintained against the Work of God, and almost against every passage and transaction thereof; so have the Lovers and Owners of it, abundantly satis∣fied, and the Lord Himself determined with that pow∣er and Evidence, that, the Conversion of some and Conviction of almost all, and even of it's most de∣sperat opposers, is not the smalest part of it's Glory: But seing the party that now prevaileth, hath disdained that method, and only by plain force and Violence, in the most gross and desperat Rebellion, Blasphemy and Perfidy against God and his Cause, and the highest and most determined contempt and misreguard of all good Conscience, and sacred Oathes, that ever the sun beheld, hath carried on and advanced this present Apostacy and defection, under which all the Godly do mourn, and the Land perisheth: We shall only here endeavour, the sincere and candid Representation of these things, which, as they were once the Glory of the Lord, and joy of his people in this poor Nation, so are they now the Testimony and Triumph of his witnesses, and the Patience and Hope of all his
Sufferers, and may be the full Satisfaction of all, who shall hear of these late and present troubles, where∣with the Lord doth Exercise us, and will undoubted∣ly in the end prove, etiher the Exaltation and Praise, or the Desolation and perpetuall Confusion of BACK∣SLIDEN SCOTLAND. When Scotland▪ through the usurpation of the Roman Antichrist, and the contagion of his abominations, and through the Prid, Lust and Tyranny of Prelacy, (the very root and strength of that Kingdom of wic∣kedness) had fallen into that gross and black darkness of Ignorance and Superstition, and into these strong Delu∣sions, (wherewith the Lord as he hath threatned, so hath he ever infallibly plagued that Antichristian course) and for many hundreth Years had lien involved therein; It pleased the Lord in his wonderful mercy and free love, to cause the glorious Light of the everlasting Gospell again to arise and shine forth amongst us: Which, as it is ever best witnessed by its own Power and Purity; So through the Power and Wisdome of God alone, even by the Weakness of very mean instru∣ments, in the midst of the flames of fiery persecutions, and against the rage and fury of the Devil▪ and of all the powers of Hell, was this Work advanced and effec∣tuated: As the recordes of these times from 1494. until about the Year 1560. do plainly discover. Dure∣ing which period of time, these things are very obser∣vable. First That where and when ever the Light and Truth of God did discover & testify against the Corrup∣tions, Errors, Idolatry, and Superstitions of Popery in the same manner it testified and declared, that the Popes usurped Tyranny, and the Prid, Idleness and Domi∣nation
of the wicked Prelates, were cheefly the Authors and Maintainers thereof. Secondly. That such as the Lord did from time to time call to, and send forth for the work of the Ministry, did walk therein, with the same Painfulness▪ Poverty, Simplicity, Humility, and Equality which the Holy command and practises of our blessed Lord and his A∣postles, do so constantly commend: Hence it is, that, in so far as this point could fall under the enquiry of these times, it is clearly held out, that they acknow∣ledged no Officer in God's House, Superior to a Preach∣ing Minister and according to the standard of this Of∣fice, did they try, reject and crave the Reformation of exorbitant Prelacy. As the examinations and testimonies of the faithfull in these dayes do witness. Thirdly. That as the love of God and his blessed Truth, and the Precepts, Promise and Presence of our Lord Jesus Chirst, did enable unto all Patience with joy, such as, by the call of a clear and necessary provi∣dence, the Lord sett forth to be his witnesses; (who, for the love and Testimony of Jesus, cheerfully embraced the fire and faggott) so when the Lord did multiply the faithful to a Reasonable Capacity, they were so far from resigning themselves, and abandoning that First, and most just Priviledge of Self-defence▪ to the arbitriment even of the lawful Powers, and of that Authority which they did acknowledge, that they not only owned it and stood to it; but did account themselves so much the more obliged to their own Preservation and esteemed the same so much the more endeared to them, that the seing forth of the Glory of God, in the maintainance of the blessed Gospel and the propagation and continuance thereof, seemed so necessarily to depend thereon: which endea∣vours, they did also further extend, in the bowels and
bonds of brotherly affection in Christ Jesus, unto the same duty of defence & Assistence to all his members. And in effect, if their Principles and Practices be well con∣sidered, it will appear, that, as when God called them to suffering, they loved not their lives unto Death that they might witness a good confession; so when they at∣tained to any Probability of Acting, they thought them∣selves indispensibly obliged, upon their uttermost hazard to defend the Gospel which they had receaved, and to suppress all Superstition and Idolatry contrary therto, although the motive of Self-defence had not been conjoined: And it will also appear, that the Necessity of Convocations and Combinations (though not only with∣out but even against Authority; Yet being in order to such necessary and just Ends) did suffiriently warrand them befor God and all men, from the breach of any Law or Act then standing against the same, wherewith they might have been charged. For verification here∣of, though the whole course of our Reformation be an unquestionable evidence, yet let the instance of their first Appearance be observed, wherein both the Mo∣tives, Actors and all other circumstances, do more clearly and beyond all cavillation hold out, that only the Love and Zeal of God, in the same Spirit in which they had so constantly suffered, did stir them up, from the pure and vive sense of their indispensible duty and certaine Priviledge, against all opposition whatsomever, to own and set themselves for the Defence of the Gospel and the true Ministers thereof. The passage is thus. In or about the Year 1555 the Queen by the in∣stigation of the Prelats, (perceaving the increase of the Protestants, and fearing some inward distraction, during the wars then with England, if Shee should
fall upon a more rigorous and general course,) did cause all the Preachers to be summoned: whereupon the body and generality of the whole Protestants, resol∣ved to keep the Dyet. But the Bishops apprehend∣ing the hazard, did procure that they should be com∣manded instantly to the borders: Nevertheless God had so provided▪ that upon the same day the West-land Quarter returned from it; which consisting of many faithful men▪ so soon as they understood the matter, they repaired to the Queen, and plainly in the hearing of the Prelates did charge them, with the cruel device intended, and certified Her' of their resolution, both to oppose it, and defend their Brethren to their utter∣most; and ceased not, until that She was moved to discharge the citation. Thereafter in the Year 1557. they entered into a Co∣venant of constant mutual Defence of the Gospel, their Ministers, and themselves, against all their adversaries, in these words, VVe perceiving how Sathan in his mem∣bers, the Antichrists of our time, cruelly do rage, seeking to overthrow and destroy the Gospel of Christ, and his Congregation, ought, according to our bounden duty, to strive in our Masters Cause, even unto the death, being certaine of the Victorie in him: The which our duty being well considered, VVe do promise before the Majesty of God, and his Congregation, That we (by his grace) shal with all diligence continually ap∣ply our whole power, substance, and our very lives, to maintain, set forward, and establish the most bles∣sed VVord of God, and his Congregation: And shall labour according to our power, to have faithfull Mini∣sters,
truly and purely to minister Christs Gospel and Sacraments to his people. VVe shal maintain them, nou∣rish them, and defend them; the whole Congregation of Christ, and every Member thereof according to our whole powers, and waging of our lives, against Sathan and all wicked power that doth intend Tyrranny or trouble against the foresaid Congregation. Vnto the which holy VVord, and Congregation, we de joyne us; and so do forsake and renounce the Congregation of Sa∣than with all the superstitious abomination and idolatry thereof. And moreover, shall declare our selves ma∣nifest enemies therto, by this our faithful promise before God testified to this Congregation, by our Subscription at these Presents. At Edinburgh the third Day of De∣cember, Anno 1557. God called to witness. Like as in the Year 1559. being again necessitated to assemble for, and stand to the defence of the Gospel and themselves, at Perth, they renewed and enlarged the same engagement, according to the good hand and Spirit of God upon his Servants, in these words, At Perth the last day of May, the Year of God 1559. Yeares, the Congregations of the VVest Countrey, with the Congregations of Fife, Perth, Dundie, Angus, Merns and Monross, being conveened in the town of Perth, in the Name of Iesus Christ, for setting forth of his glory, understanding nothing more necessary for the same, then to keep a constant amity, unity, and fellowship together, according as they are commanded by God, are confederate, and become bounden and
obliged in the presence of God, to concurre & assist together in doing all things required of God in his Scripture, that may be to his glory; And at their whole powers to de∣stroy and put away all things that doth dishonour to his name, so that God may be truly and purely worshipped. And in case that any trouble be intended aganst the said Congregation, or any part or member thereof, the whole Congregation shall concurre, assist, and conveen toge∣ther, to the defence of the same Congregation or per∣son troubled: And shall not spare Labours, goods, Sub∣stance, Bodies and Lives, in maintaining the liberty of the whole Congregation, and every member thereof, against whatsoever person shall intend the said trouble for cause of Religion, or any other cause depending thereupon, or lay to their charge under pretence thereof, although it happen to be coloured with any other outward cause. And again in the Moneth of August, the same Year, after having sustained and valiantly resisted a second assault, both of the wicked Prelats and of their other violent adversaries; by a third band & Oath they added a further caution to their former engagements, to the effect that in so just and holy a cause, they might never by force or fraud be thereafter fainted or divided. And lastly in April Anno 150. they ingaged them∣selves in a fourth bond in these words, VVe whose names are underwritten, have promised and oblidged our selves faithfully in the presence of God, and by these presents do promise, that we together in Generall, and every one of us in special by himself, with our bodies,
goods and friends, and all that we can doe, shall set for∣ward the Reformation of Religion, according to Gods VVord, and procure by all means possible, that the Truth of Gods VVord, my haue free passage within this realme, with due administration of Sacraments, and all things depending upon the said VVord—that we shall each one with another, all of us, effectually con∣curre, joine in one, take & hold one plain part for the, — and recovery of our ancient freedome, Liberties.—that we way be ruled by the Lawes and Custome of the Countrey.—Again that we shall tender the com∣mon Cause, as if it were the Cause of every one of us in particular; And that the Causes of every one of us now joyned together, being lawfull and honest, shall be all our Cause in Generall; And that he that is enemy to the Cause foresaid, shall be Enemy to us all in so far.—Wee have superadded these instances (as wee might have done two or three more) to the first proposed, because of their great resemblance, since there can be nothing more manifest, then that the same Provocations the same Spirit, the same Principles, and the same De∣sign, did most uniformly influence all these Trans∣actions. Now seeing that both the Occasion, Actors, Aime, and End of the first Action, and especially the observable Providence of God, that without all contrivance of man did over-rule it, do clearly purge it of any intended Rebellion or other wickedness; Cer∣tainly to affirm that all these things were nevertheless acted in, & by a Rebellious Spirit, must be a sinn, at least next unto that of high despit and Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, and Spirit of grace, by whose power
alone, this blessed work was effectuated: Neither durst the Arch-Prelat himself though our Arch-Adver∣sary in this our present cause, and though he knew that the same doth infallibly, either stand or fall upon the same principles and grounds with these cases now un∣der consideration, proceed any further in his censure of these courses and practices; then to disprove them as Violent and Disorderly. There is one thing further, which is also before touched, that the instances above adduced especially the first, both for the Meanness of it's Actors the unpremeditated plainness of its Manner, and the singlness and purity of its End, doth most evidently make out, viz: that as these men of God, by their small and improbable appearance, did as much witness their unfained love of the Truth and zeal of his Glory, in the manifest contempt and hazard of their lives and fortuns, As when under the dispensation and call of another providence, they did patiently and cheerfully upon the same motives, lay down their lives, and suffer the loss of all things; So the end of their un∣dertaking, was not only their own just and necessary Defence, which in such an apparent danger, might rather seem to be abandoned then intended, but above all things, the Maintainance & Defence of that blessed Evangel, which was dearer to them, then all other interests whatsoever. Wee know our great adversaries, who for the gain and pleasours of this life (what then would they not do for the preservation of life it self?) have often renounced, and would again renounce all Conscience, Alleagance and Truth; and who by their detestable Flatterv, in denying the lawfulness of Self-defence, (although in effect Self be their only Idol) & pretending a fained affection, & illimited submission without reserve, do only court the Powers, for the
advanceing of these interests, which they seem to re∣linquish; as the revolutions of the World, have fre∣quently declared their practises in prejudice of both Religion and Royalty, and have often resolved both their practises and principles, into that one Devilish position, the first yea only fixed rule of their Religion Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath will be give for his life; These, we say, are not curious to enquire in this di∣stinction; Yet, seeing they leave nothing unessayed whereby to promote their design, and therefore, do often cavil from such advantages as the work of God afterwards obtained, and particularly the Concurrence of the Peers and Primores Regni, and from the defect thereof in the first appearances, would infer the unlaw∣fulness of rhe same, especially in order to the design of Reformation; Therefore wee further add with these noble worthies, that as it cannot be denied, 1. That the right & Priviledge of Self-defence is not only founded in, but is the very first instinct of pure Nature, and spring of all motion and action. 2. That it was competent to, and exercised by every individual, before that either Society or Government were known. 3. That it was so far from being surrendred or suppressed by the erect∣ing of these, that it was & is the great End & motive, for which all voluntary Societies and Policies were in∣troduced and are continued. 4. That it is a princi∣pal rule of Righteousness, whereunto that great com∣mand of love to our neightbour, by the Law of God & by our Lord himself is resolved, & whereby it is inter∣preted; so it doth infallibly follow, that the same right and Priviledge is yet competent to all men, whither Separatly or Jointly; and needeth no other prerequisit, but that of intollerable and inevitable injury; (which for a man to suffer under pretext of the good of the Com∣mon-wealth,
would be, for the delusion of an emptie name, only for the lust of others, really to deprive himself of his whole share and interest therein) and is compleated for exercise by such a Probable Capacity, as may encourage the Asseters thereof to undertake it. And as for that other, and more noble design of the Maintainance and Reformation of Religion, waving the question and Debate. Whether the same can or ought to be by force maintained? Which may appear sufficiently determined to rationall men, by the very contrary Practises of it's adversaries, who not only by force do fight aginst it, but most irreligiously usurpe and detort it's own weapons viz: the precepts of our Lord, for patience and meeknes under a dispensation of suffering, to the persuasion of a stupid submission, and casting away the opportunity of Desence and Acting; that without controll they may work it's overthrow; And supposing with all men, that force is not a proper argument of persuasion, and that Religion neither can nor ought to be thereby propagated; Yet are we in conscience persuaded, that the grounds follouwing, evidently held out in the records of these times, are beyond contradiction. 1. That Religion (the highest concernment of Gods glory and of mans happiness both temporall and eter∣nall) is the most important, dear and precious of all interests. 2. That to be violented in this (which cannot be without an unjust force either or mens Persons or Goods) is the most wicked and insupportable of all in∣juries. 3. That the propelling by force of such injuries▪ was the justest cause and quarrell, that men in their Primaeve Liberty could be engaged in.
4. That, as for the security of this Interest, and no wayes to make an absolut surrender thereof to the arbitriment of any, men were mostly induced to the appointing of Governours, so the glory of God, which is the end of all things, but herein is most especially concerned was by the erecting of Rule and Govern∣ment for the security of Religion, more particularly and eminently intended. 5. That the Powers appoined for Preservation, cannot warrantably endeavour Subversion. 6. That, as every man is bound to obey God rather then man; so such Violence, and intollerable and ineviable injury offered by he Powers on this account, as to the person injured, destroyeth boh the Common-welath of he people, & more specially, the Glory of God which are the only ends of Governments, maketh both the End, the Means of Government and Autho∣rity, and the injured person's Obligation thereunto, to cease. 7. As the persons, one or more, reduced to this estate and condition▪ if by a real or apparent incapacity of Acting, they conceave them selves called to a Testi∣mony by Suffering ought herein with all patience, to give unto God the Glory; so having the opportunity of, and being called▪ whither to their own Defence, or the Assiing of their Brethren in so just a cause, they ought therein valiantly to acquit themselves, for the Glory of God, the mantainance of his Truth, and the mutuall preservation one of another. 8. As the Combination of more persons, whom the same common cause of just and necessary Defence doth join together▪ is founded upon and doth most native∣ly arise from that Primaeve Right and Priviledge, which at first gave Being and Rise to all Societies, and where∣unto,
the force of extream Necessity, through the per∣version of that Mean of Government, appointed for their Preservation, doth ultimatly reduce them; so the duty of mutual Assistance, is not only warranted by that prin∣ciple of Humanity and common Stipulation, which is the Motive and Bond of mens entering into Society, the immediat and subordinat End of all Rule, and the most effective Mean, whereby that superior end of the Good and Safety of every Individuall therein included, can be best secured: But also, first, by that more endear∣ing principle of Christian and brotherly Affection in the Lord; upon the indispensible force and obligation whereof, the very glory and righteousness of the great and last judgement seemeth to be founded, Math. 25:31. to the end. And, secondly, by that supream & chief con∣cernment of God's Glory, to which the interests of all Powers & Common-wealth's must certainly stoop and cede. And how is it possible, that any scruple anent this can remain with any considerat or conscientious person? if we consider that whole Cities, Kingdomes▪ & Em∣pires, for the violation of this duty, in not releeving & delivering of Innocents from the unjust Tyranny, even of lawful Powers, have been involved in the Guilt of the violence and cruelty, which had been only acted by one or a few persons, and have been overtaken therefore, by fearfull effects and Iudgments, to their utter ruine and Subversion. As is most evidently confirmed by that clear intimation thereof made by Ieremiah, to the Jewes, Chap. 26..15. Know ye for a certain that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, & upon THIS CITY, and upon THE INHABITANTS thereof. 9. As the Power & exercise of Reformation hath been grosly calumniated by the adversaries, as if thereby were meant and had been practised manifest force and
violence upon Consciences and Persuasions; so on the other hand, open Idolatry, Blasphemy, Perjury, Venting and Spreading of Heresy, and such like abo∣minations, (being most dishonorable to God, and pernicious to all Common-wealths) ought without doubt, by all means to be suppressed, restrained and severely punished Now, that this Vindicative and (in case of backsliding) Reforming Power is commit∣ted to the Magistrat, and that he is thereto mainly ap∣pointed, none will question; But what if not only the supreame Magistrat, but with him all the Nobles and Primores of the Realme shall turn the principal perver∣ters, and chief Patrons of these abominations? As we have already cleared, that, in case either the People or any part of them, be violented to a sinful com∣plyance, or be wickedly persecuted for adhering to God in the profession and practise of the contrary du∣ties; they may lawfully Defend themselves, and are mutually bound to assist and deliver one another: So it now comes to be considered, that, seing the maintenance of Truth and the true Worship of God, were and are the principal ends and motives of contracting of Socie∣ties and erecting of Governments, whereunto both the People and Rulers, are not only separatly every one for himself, but jointly oblidged for the publick ad∣vancement & establishment thereof; & that God doth therefore equally exact and avenge the sin of the Rulers only, or of the People only, or of any part of the People only, upon the whole body of the Rulers and People, for their simple Tollerance and connivance, without their active complyance with the transgressors; of ne∣cessity, both from the principles deduced, and from the most visible judgments of God agreeable thereto, there must be a Superior and Antecedent obligation to
that of Submission, incumbent upon all both jointly and separatly, for the maintenance, vindication and Reformation of Religion, in order to the promoting of these great ends of the publick profession of Truth and true Worship, which the Lord doth indispensibly re∣quire. And though this position be indeed more evi∣dent, where express Covenants betwixt God and the whole People, betwixt Rulers and their Subjects, and betwixt the People and subjects amongst themselves in order to these Holy Duties can be produced; ye seing all Constitutions of Societies and Governments, do virtually suppose and imply the same, and are found∣ed thereon, the Assertion doth with equal certainty firmly hold: But that all contradiction may stop it's mouth, let the import and true meaning of the Scrip∣tures, and instances following be impartially weighed. Deut. 13: ver. 12, 13, 14, 15. The Lord saith, If thou shalt hear that in one of thy cities, certain men amongst yow have with-drawn the inhabitants of their city, to serve other Gods, and if after deligent searchs the thing be found a truth, thou shal smite and destroy that city utterly. Jos. 22: ver. 17, 18, 19. Phinhas saith to the two Tribes and the half, upon their supposed defection, If yee rebel to day against the Lord, to morrow he will be wroth with the whole Congrega∣tion of Israel: And Judges 22. throughout, in the case of Israel against Benjamin and Gibeah. All the places, as they clearly hold out the command and practise most consonant to our position; so to think that the same may be evaded, by astricting the places to the Hypothesis contained in the letter viz: of more or all the cities a∣gainst one apostatizing, and that either an equal division of the cities, (the one half faithful, the other back∣slidden) should bring the matter to an accommodation; or that the greater part backsliden (who certainly had
the casting voice in that Democratick constitution, should oblige the fewer remaining stedfast, to a sinful acqui∣escence, is to elude all Scripture, and mock the Holy Ghost by whom it is given. Now, whither these places and what is premised, do warrand an just exten∣tion thereof in favours of the People, against back∣sliden Rulers both supream and subordinat, or even in favours of a part of the People (with the caution sub∣joyned) against the greater part wickedly backsliden, let the World judge. Oh! did the wrath of God, for the hidden and secret sin of one poor acursed Achan, sud∣denly and fearfully overtake the whole People, and ALL THE CONGREGATION of Israel, so that, that man perished not ALONE in his iniquity? and had not our Reformers great reason to fear and tremble, least the Manifest Tolleration of proud, cruel, and flatter∣ing Prelats, who had perverted the lawful Powers into bloody Persecuters; and of Idolatours Priests, whose wickedness and Idolatry had corrupted the whole Land, might involve, not only themselves but the whole Nation, in destroying and overflowing in∣dignation. We are not ignorant of the no less wicked then ground less cavils of some, as if we would make or have every man to be a Phinehas: And what then? Would God (if wishes, yea prayers and teares could make it) that all his Servants were as Phinehas, and that he would pour upon every one of them, the same Spirit of Holy Zeall which was in him, that by re∣movall of the cause, his fierce anger against this poor consuming Land might cease. But as for that Act of Phinehas, the termes following being generall and ambigous, admitting of severall distinctions and sub∣distinctions, as it is not easy without distinguishing,
in thesi to define an Action and Call Extraordinary, and an Action and Call thereunto, only Heroicall; and to state the true specificall Difference and just limits be∣twen an Action and Call Extraordinary, and an Action and Call Heroicall, as they are strickly taken and contradistinguished; and clearly and convincingly to demonstrat, what and how much more is required in an Extraordinary Call to an Extraordinary Action, then is required in a sufficient Call unto an Heroicall Action? and whether an eminent measure of Holy Zeal, Magnanimity and Fortitude do constitut a suffi∣cient Call unto an Heroicall Action; or do only Dis∣pose and fit the person for the right and better perfor∣mance thereof, as a Call unto the Action, and the Fitness of the Person for doing of the same are contra∣dictinguished; or may not both Dispose and fit the person for performance of the Action, and also include and give a Call unto the Action it self: So when the matter is fully considered, it will be more difficult then perhaps is apprehended, to prove that the Act of Phinehas was Extraordinary, strickly taken and in contradistinction to that which is only Heroical; or that his Call thereunto was Extraordinary, in contradistinc∣tion to that which is a sufficient Call unto an Heroicall Action; and more difficult to determine, otherwise then by naked assertion, what that Extraordinary Call was? Wherein it did consist? Wherein it did differ from, Exceed or Excell a Call unto an Heroick Action? And therefore, it will be also hard con∣vincingly to demonstrat, that it might not have been lawfully done by another of the Children of Israel, whom the Lord had animated thereunto, by the same Holy Zeall and Resolution. And this is the more considerable, because, as we very rarely, (if at all)
find the Lord commending and rewarding persons for Extraordinary Actions, whereunto they had Ex∣traordinary Calls, so much and so highly, as here He Commendeth and Rewardeth Phinehas: So the Text it self Numb. 25. doth lay the great, if not the only weight and ground of his Commendation and Reward, upon his ZEALL, and not upon any Extraordinary Call, whereof there is not the least hint or insinuation; For vers 11. the Lord saith, He turned my wrath away from the Children of srael, while he was ZEALOUS for my sake among them; and therefore vers 12, 13. pro∣miseth him, His Covenant of peace. a seed after him, and the Covenant of an Everlasting Priesthood, BECAUS, he was ZEALOUS for his God. And if any shall, as it is like some will alleadge, that Heroicall Actions, are not more Imitable then these which are Extraordi∣nary; It is humbly offered to be considered, anent He∣roicall Actions in generall, Whether, when the mat∣ter of an Action is not only Ordinary, that is, neither Preternaturall nor Supernaturall, though not very Fre∣quent; but also Just and Lawfull, yea, and Neces∣sary, both by Divine Precept, & as a Mean to a good and Necessary End; and when either, there is not, or doth not appear any other to do the work, whe∣ther, I say, in that case, a Spirit of Holy Zeall, Magnanimity and Courage, wrought and excited by the Lord in his Servants and People, moe or fewer, being otherwise in a Rationall and probable Capacity, be not for that time a sufficient Call, unto the per∣formance of these Actions which are commonly called Heroicall; and especially when and where, the Action is not unnecessarily, irrationally, nor in vanity attempted, but may be and is performed, not only without prejudice of the True, Necessary and Chief
Good of the Church and Common-wealth, or of any particular person's just Right and security; but also in the case of the Magistrat, and others, their wilfull and perverse neglecting of their duty, is necessarly undertaken, and is not only formally intended by the Actor, but also natively and really doth conduce to the Glory of God, the Good of Religion, the pre∣servation and establishment of Church and Common∣wealth, and of every particular person's Just Rights and Security, by suppressing of Impiety, promoving of Truth and Holiness, doing of Justice, Turning away of wrath and removing of present and prevent∣ing of future Jugdments. And as for the particular instance of Phinehas, if the Lord did not only raise him up to that particular Act of Justice, but also warrant and accept him therein, and reward him therefore, upon the accompt of his Zeall, when there was a Godly and Zealous Magistrat, able, & whom we cannot without breach of charity presume, but also willing to Execute Justice; How much more may it be pleaded, that the Lord, who is the same, yesterday, to day and for ever, will, not only pour out of that same Spirit upon others, but also when he gives it, both Allow them though they be but private persons, and also Call them being otherwise in a Physical and probable Capacity, to do these things in an Extremely necessitous, and otherwise irrecoverable State of the Church, to which in a more intire condition thereof, he doth not Call them; and particularly when there is not only the like or worse provocations, the like Necessity of the Execution of justice and of Reformation, for the turning away of Wrath and Removall of Judgments, that was in Phinehas case; but also when the Supreme
Civil Magistrat, the Primores Regni and other inferior Rulers, are not only unwilling to do their duty, but so far corrupted and perverted, that they are become the Authors and patronizers of these abominations. Which is also the more considerable, because, if upon the fear or suspicion of the Accidental hazard of Private mens usurping of the Office, or doing of the duty of Publick persons, every vertue and vertous Action, which may be so abused, shall be utterly neglected, Impiety shall quickly gain an Universall Empire, to the extermination of all Goodness. It is true, that the God of Order hath assigned to every man his Station and Calling, within the bounds whereof he should keep, without transgressing by Defect or Ex∣cess; and therein wait and act, in such a measure of the Spirit as He is pleased to comunicate: And we do not hold such instances for Regulare & ordinary precedents for all times and persons universally; which while some have fancyed, and heeding more the glory and fame of the Action, then the sound and solid Rule of the Holy Scriptures, they have been tempted and carried to fearfull Extravagancies: Neither are insolent or disorderly much less Wicked attempts, which sometimes have covered and yet may mask themselves with a pretence of Zeal, upon this or any other ground to be licenced or approved; But on the other hand, as these instances hold forth, for the conviction and reproof of our stupidity and indiffe∣rency, what an high pitch of Holy Zeall and Courage, the Servants of the Lord have sometimes attained, and do further demonstrat, that He doth sometimes war∣rant even Private persons, in their doing of these things in an Extream Necessity and collapsed state of the Church, to which at other times He doth not
call them: So when the Lord, with whom is the residue of the Spirit, doth breath upon his people more or fewer, to the exciting of more then Ordi∣nary Zeal, Courage and Resolution, for the Re∣forming of an Apostat Church, for the Execution of justice upon the Adversaries, and for the ad∣vancing and establishing of Truth and Holiness in the Earth, wee should rather ascribe glory and praise to Him, whose hand is not shortened, but many times choiseth the Weak and Foolish things of the World to confound the Mighty and the Wise, then condemn His Instruments for Rebels and Usurpers, as it is like Phinhas would have been, had he lived in this generarion, if the same Lord, who by his Spirit had Acted him, had not also by his own hand rescued him. 10. As the Right of Self-Defence, mutual Assistance and Reformation, is properly and only derivable from the grounds adduced; so the Concurse of the Nobles and Primores Regni, is no wayes of absolute neces∣sity, though indeed singularly conducible for the carry∣ing on thereof. Unto which Concurrence, as they are doubly obliged, according to that, unto whom much is given, of the same much shall be required; so, if they shall convert their Power to the strengthning of the hands of the wicked, they do thereby not only aggra∣vat their own condemnation, but by their endeavour∣ing to wreath & fasten more strongly the yoke of wick∣edness and oppression, they do the rather and more justify the cause and plea of all the Asserters of Truth and Righteousness. These are a part of the grounds, whereupon these Noble Worrhies, raised up by God & eminently by him inspired, did singly act for His own glory: which as they
have left upon record for their own perpetual vindica∣tion, so thereby they did clearly purge themselves from all imputation of Rebellion. Nor were their proceed∣ings and practises ever by any so much as termed disor∣derly, except by such who being altogether indifferent in the Work of God, endeavour by all means to ca∣lumniat and shame them, from being made precedents to their own prejudice. Fourthly. It is observable, that though the practises of these first times were Extraordinary, and to many may appear Disorderly, Yet the faithful men whom the Lord honoured both to Suffer & to Do for His name, did constantly and boldly charge both the Rise and pro∣gress of these disorders, upon the Persons then in Power & Authority, who, being ordained & entrusted by God, for the defence & maintenance of Truth and Righteousness, (as the only true foundations and solid grounds of the Peoples felicity whither temporal or eternal; and including all the ends, for which either the Power or Persons of Governours are appointed; and conse∣quently, the principal bonds of all obedience and sub∣jection, for which all these engadgements are intend∣ed, and to which they do ultimatly refer) by resiel∣ing and starting out from this most sacred and fixed line of subordination; As they could not claim Obedience to their unjust commands, so, far-less could they oblidge the people, to that more then slavish and brutish subjection, in the submitting of their souls, bo∣dies & goods to the arbitriment of their cruel Tyranny, directly contrary unto, and destructive of all these holy & great Ends, both of Gods Glory, and the Peoples spiritual and temporal Good, for which they were constituted Governours. That this was the source and fountain of all disorders
in these times, and that it was so reputed to be, by these valiant Worthies who then opposed them, the Hi∣story thereof doth plainly verify. Wee are not forgetful, how vehemently the Powers on earth, which set themselves against the Lord, and their creaturs and flat∣terers, have in all times decryed such assertions: The noise, belshings, & thundering, of Treason, Treason, wherewith the very mentioning of such positions, useth at once to be attended and condemned, do already sound in our ears: Let such as are thereby alarmed, read the debats and controversies, both of former & later times; Especially these two Martyrs against Ty∣ranny, Lex Rex, and the Apologetical Narration upon this subject. This is our peace and establishment be∣fore the Lord and all men; that wee with our Noble Reformers do acknowledge and honour Authority as the great Ordinance of God, for the uphold and maintainance of Truth and Righteousness; and the Persons therewith vested, not only as eminently thereby dignified, but also as most signally impressed, by a very sacred and illustrious Character of the glorious Majesty of the Most High, who hath ap∣poynted them: But on the orher hand, wee cannot but wish, that these same persons would constantly re∣member, that not only they are the Ministers of God, and to Him accountable; but also his Ministers to the People for their Good, whom they neither ought to Tyrannize over at their own Pleasure, nor Rule only for their own Profit. O! that these sacred Boundaries had ever been observed, & that both Ty∣ranny and Rebellion with all their Antidots and reme∣dies, had been perpetually unknown. But shall Tyranny, unto which, Power, both in it's self is so easily corrupted, and by the flattery of others more
frequently abused, be not only shrouded under the priviledge and impunity of a Divine Exemption; but thereby, in effect be more intollerably licenced, to the acting of all wickedness and violence, and the perverting and overturning of all the ends of Govern∣ment? And in the mean time, shall the Peoples most just & necessary Defence of themselves, (whereunto they are seldome and very hardly provocked, even by the most extream necessity) & of all their most pre∣cious concernments, the very ends for which the Powers are ordained, be continually at the Arbitri∣ment of any Court-Creature or flatterer, proscrib∣ed and persecuted under these odious names of Trea∣son and Rebellion? Certainly, neither the All-wise Providence of God; not yet the frame of nature can endure such a Solecisme. For our part, as wee are per∣swaded, that none pleadeth for this Absolut Submis∣sion in the People and Exemption of the Prince but such as for advancing of their own interest, have first prostrated their Consciences to the Princes arbitri∣ment, in a blind & Absolut Obedience; whereby they know themselves sufficiently secured from all smart & inconvenience, of that more Brutall then Rationall sub∣mission contended for: So are wee confident, that seing Subjection is principally enjoyned, for and in order to Obedience, whatsoever Reason or Authority can be adduced to perswad an absolut & indispensible Subjection, will far more rationally and plausibly infer an illimited and Absolut Obedience; and that to plead for a priviledge in the point of Obedience, & to disclam it in the point of subjection, is only the flattety of such, as having renounced with Conscience all dis∣tinction of Obedience, would devest others of all Pri∣viledges, that they may exercise their Tyranny without
without controll. But He who hath called Rulers, Gods; Doth notwithstanding Himself remain the Most High God over all the Earth; & from his Obe∣dience, neither the Commands nor Violence of Kings of Clay ought in the least to remove us. And as these inferior Princes do often forget their Subordination to the Most High, in their unjust commands; & would usurpe His Throne, by an uncontrollable Soverain∣ty; so the Lord, by the warrand of his Word, and approbation of his Providence, and also of the People, (when by them oppressed, but by Himself animated & strengthned) hath declared & made void this their pretended exemption and impunity, and removed the carcases of such Kings and broken their Scepter. Amongst which precedents, the instance of these times, whereof we now speak, is worthily recorded, and deserveth better to be remembred. Seing therefore, that neither the Ordinance and Commission of God, nor yet the Surrender of the People, though into ane absolut slavery (which yet no presumption less then their own most Express Con∣sent can possibly infer) can from any certain and ra∣tional ground and warrant, be either produced or plead∣ed for vesting the Prince with that arbitrary and irresi∣stible Power and Dominion, necessary and requisit to oblidge the Subject to a stupid and brutish submission, to all possible injuries and outrages; and that it is im∣possible for any rational man, to concede that Privil∣edge of exemption and impunity to wickedness and fury, for murthering both the Souls & Bodies of poor Subjects, which our very adversaries deny to Weakness or Folly in case of Alienation of the Kingdome or any part thereof, or any such gross act of Mal-versation,
& lastly seing the great inconvenience, of opening a door to Rebellion & all disorder, mainly urged by the Adversaries, against the permitting of the People any judgment or reflection upon the Princes Actings, doth more rationally plead for Implicit & blind Obe∣dience, which they themselves disprove, then mili∣tat against necessary Defence and resistance in case of persecution for lawfull non-obedience; And that the great and true Salvo of all these inconveniences, and the main establishment of the Throne, is only true judgement and Righteousness, No sober and im∣partial person can condemn their position, who deny∣ing that a Tyrannous Magistrat was the Minister of God to them for their Good, did plainly assert the lawfulness of Self-Defence, and holy Reforma∣tion, without the violation of the Ordinance of God. But if all these things do not satisfy, Let, 1. the rea∣son of Gods delivering of the Kingdom to the Peo∣ple and not to the King, with the Law it self, Deut 27. ver. 14. (which the maner of the Kingdom and in effect of Tyranny, foretold by the Lord and Samuel 1 Sam. 10. v. 10. by way of dissuasive, did no wayes repeal) 2. The import of the Contract and Cove∣nant betwixt Prince & Subject, with the unquestion∣able interpretation and execution thereof, extant in the records of all Times and Nations; 3. The deed of the People in opposing Saul in favours of Ionathan▪ 1 Sam. 14. v. 45. and of the ten Tribes in rejecting of Rehoboam, 1 King cap. 12. (which though v. 19. i be termed Rebellion, yet is it no more thereby condemn∣ed, then good Hezekiah, who is said 2 King 18. ver. 7. to have rebelled against the King of Assyria) and o Libna in revolting from under Iehoram, 2 Cron. 21. 10▪
4. The Prophecies, Manner, & Practise of the most part of the late blessed Reformations. And lastly let the peculiar Right and Constution of this Kingdome by King and Parliament be considered and solidly answer∣ed; And then will wee also subscribe to the condemna∣tion of our Reformers and crave pardon for this digres∣sion. Upon these grounds and principles did our Noble Ancestours vigorously bestir themselves, and proceed in the Work of God. And as the Lord was ever with them while they were with Him, and did mind his work steadfastly in sincerity and uprightness of heart; so notwithstanding all the fals-hood and faintings which many discovered, yet the Lord himself did gloriously own it, and ceased not, until by the fair product of his own glory, in the clear manifesta∣tion of his blessed Evangil, he had without the least prejudice of the fundamental constitution and rights of Government, to the eternal confutation of all calum∣nies and reproaches, put on the Copestone with these joyous, and never to be forgotten acclamations of Grace, Grace. Thus in the Year 1560. the Land is enlightned, the blessed Gospel of our Lord again revealed and restored; in so much, that both by the first General Assembly of this Church then conveening, and the Parliament then holden, A large Confession of the true Faith is framed▪ approved and published. O! that men would remember, seriously consider and fix in their hearts, the greatness and excellency of this Work of Grace and Glory, bringing Salvation, Peace and Goodwil towards men; And manifesting the praise and Glory of God in the highest; that in the just estimation thereof, they might also duly and truly
ponder discern, approve or reject all things conducing, either to it's advantage or prejudice. But here is the root of all our sinn and misery, that though this Light, be only our Life; and the Salvation and Redemption thereby revealed, be no less then the project of God's eternall love, and the subject of His eternall delight; and was more dear and glorious to our Lord Jesus, then the bosome of the Father, & all the glory of Hea∣ven; yet men, so greatly and highly therein con∣cerned, do at best but rejoyce therein for a season, and soon relapse, first into Indifferency and Formality, and then into Error, Superstition and all Ignorance. This the Devil, the author of all wickness, know∣ing and improving to the uttermost, for the advance∣ment of his own Kingdom, doth quickly take advan∣tage of, for setting on work and promoving of that Mystery of iniquity. Which (springing up in that bitter root of Pride, and working in the Spiritual power and subtilty thereof) as it began to work very early in the Christian Church, even amongst the Disciples themselves, in presence of their and our Lord, (as ap∣peareth by their contention, who should be greatest) And notwithstanding all the Grace, Power, and Pre∣sence of the Lord, which appeared in the times that fol∣lowed, & all the long & violent persecution, wherewith the Church of God was then exercised; yet continu∣ing it's motion, did still advance, until attaining it's maturity in the revelation of the Man of Sin, it filled and overwhelmed the Christian World, with these strong delusions of Superstition, Idolatry, and all darkness that so long prevailed therein: So it is the main and only Engine whereby Sathan, as in all other Churches, so in this of Our's▪ hath so actively bestired himself, and attempted the overthrow of their later Reformations.
These are the causes, why, notwithstanding of that great and glorious Light which the Lord made to shine amongst us, the true Government and Disci∣pline of the Church of Christ▪ (though his own great Ordinance, instituted both for Fencing and securing of Truth in Purity, and for promoving of the same in Power; and though by the Light of that same Truth, clearly discovered and Manifested) through long op∣position and many difficulties, did scarce in these day∣es attain it's establishment. Yet the Lord, who of his own free Mercy and Grace, did visit us with the day-spring of his blessed Gospel from on high; did also by his own Power and Presence, in and with his faithful Servants, at length also compleat his work, and establish his Kingdome over us and his Government amongst us: And so the Kingdome became the Lord's; even the first fruits of the Kingdomes of the Earth, unto our Lord Jesus Christ. The Progress and Period of this work, was from the Year 1560. unto the Year 1592. dureing which space, these things are very observable. 1. So soon as this Church attained to freedome from persecution and contrary violence, they Assembled in their first National Synod in the Year 1560. by vertue of that Intrinsick Power and Priviledg granted by our Lord unto his Church, and exercised by his Apostles and their followers; and that without any question or control: Nor did they so much as petition for the li∣cence of the then Authority, though the same might have been more easily obtained, then the warrant at that time impetrated for conveening of the Parlia∣ment.
2. As they first Assembled, and by vertue of the same warrant, did set on foot and continue a con∣stant series of their Courts and meetings; (except in so far as by plain force and violence they were restrained) so they held the same in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ only, and in his sole Authority, by Direction of his Word and Spirit, concluded all their Counsels, Votes and Acts. It's true, that they much and long wished for, and thereafter heartily accepted the countenance and concurrence of the Powers for the time; and that, not only for Decency, but also as the gracious performance of that promise, Isa. 49. ver. 23. of the favour and assistance of Kings and Queens to the Church in the later dayes: But as they were persuaded, that the Lord Jesus (perfect in all his house) when invested at his exaltation with all Power in Heaven and in Earth, did make a full grant and Commission of all Gifts and Offices requi∣sit in his Church, 1 Cor. 12. ver. 28. Ephes. 4. v. 8. & 11. (Wherein neither King nor Prince is mentioned) and that there was no Authority wanting to these first De∣crees made at Ierusalem, though emitted upon that simple warrant, Ast. 15. ver. 28. It seemed good unto the Holy Ghost and unto us, (wherein neither King nor Prince was included,) so did they account it a gross u∣surpation, for the Kings on Earth, in place of their promised Patrociny (to which they are oblidged,) to claim and invade an Over-ruling Arbitriment in the matters of God and his Church; & beleev that He who established the distinction and confirmed their Right, by separating Caesar's things from the things of God, doth also exact the same on their part. 3. The Brethren conveening in these Assemblies, did meet in perfect Parity and Equality; against which▪,
the Extraordinary employments and Commissions delegated to some, upon the account of the particular exigence of these times, did grant no Priviledge or Pre∣heminence. From these three observations, without mention∣ing the first Book of Discipline, containing the true grounds and frame of Presbyterial Government, which was compiled in the Year 8560. and then ap∣proved by the whole Church, and subscribed to by a great many Lords and Counsellors, it is evident that Presbyterial Government was from the beginning of the Reformation constantly intended, and it's founda∣tion really laid. We need not mention that the Pope's Authority and all Jurisdiction flowing there∣from, was by Law in the same Year 1560, expres∣ly abrogated and discharged; nor that in these first Assemblies, greater Benefices were craved to be dis∣solved, and Prelacy reputed to be only an Humane Device; nor is it necessary for us to clear, how that Ex∣traordinary employment of Superintendency, used for a few Years in the beginning, was both only designed for an Interim, and in it self wholly different from Prela∣cy, and was at length rejected as burthensome. All these things are sufficiently cleared by the late Large Apology. 4. It is observable, that as the Avarice and Power of some, who possessed and grasped after the Churches Revenues, did, by the procurement of a few packed Commissioners, in the Year 1671, introduce these Mock-Bishops (called Tulchan) for the better securing of their own gain, which in the Assemblies immediatly succeeding, were first protested against, then quarrell∣ed, and lastly restrained and subjected thereunto; So the Lord used the same as a warning, to awaken and
animat his Servants to a more vigorous prosecution of the establishment of His House in it's due Govern∣ment: In pursuance whereof, the Assemblies with the King's concurrence, from the Year 1575 until the Year 1581. did with much Prayer, Fasting and Pain∣fulness intend the work, until by perfecting of the Se∣cond Book of Discipline, and reducing of the Bis∣hops to a simple Dimission, and condemning their Office as unwarrantable, they cmpleated their work in the exact model of Presbyterial Government, in all it's Courts and Officers. 5. During this space in March 1581. (as we now reckon) and after the Assembly had condemned the Office of Bishops as unwarrantable, the King, his Court and Council did swear and subscribe to the Na∣tional Covenant; By which both the Pope's usurped Authority over the Church in one Article, and his wicked Hierarchy in another, are abjured: And the swearers did join themselves unto this true Reformed Church, in Doctrine, Faith, Religion and Disci∣pline; promising by the Great Name of the Lord our God, to continue in the Obedience of the Doctrine and Discipline thereof all the dayes of their lives. Which Discipline, as the foregoing Assertions do clearly discover, to have been from the beginning fundamentally Presbyterial; so the Model of Presbytery being now compleated, and any shaddow of power that the Mock-Bishops had lately usurped, being now fully abrogated, it is sufficiently clear, that both Prelacy is by this Covenant abjured, and Presbytery own∣ed and sworn to. And really if it be further consider∣ed, that the Assemblies both 1581. and 1590, while most intent and forward in the erecting of Presbyte∣ries, did enjoyn and require the same to be subscribed
by all ranks of People in the Land, and that these Acts were both seconded and enforced by Ordinances of King and Council, it may be justly doubted, whether the impudence of the succeeding Prelats in denying of the Obligation, or Perjury in breaking of it be great∣er. This is the Great Oath, into which, as the Lord God did bring us by the Power of his own Spirit and Truth, in opposition to that Bloody Bond, called the Holy League, wherein Antichrist and his followers, had at that time conjured themselves against the true Church of God; So the Kingdom thereby became the Lords, and we his peculiar people, as-well by the people's subjecting of themselves and their Al∣leageance, as by the King's submitting Himself and his Scepter, in a due Subordination unto God and our Lord Jesus Christ, for the maintenance and defence of his Church and Gospell, the Liberties of the Land and Ministration of Justice. And this Oath and the Ordinances enjoyning it, notwithstanding the many fearful violations thereof that have ensued, do yet stand to this day unrepealed and declared against, to the unanswerable conviction and condemnation, even in their own Courts and Consciences, of all it's wick∣ed Transgressors. 6. As the Tulchan Bishops were the effect and pro∣duct of the Avarice of these Lords that favoured them; So the same principle of Avarice and Wickedness did again resist the Work of God, when almost brought to Perfection, by stirring up certain of the Nobles to re-induce Bishops, for the better inhaunsing of their Benefices, and the devouring of the Churches patri∣mony: And not only for their better establishment, that what they want of Divine Right and Warrant, might be supplyed by the accession of the Kings power
and Command; but also that by their meanes, the growing wickedness of these times might abound without restraint or control, the Devil inciteth others of the more prophane, licentious and violent Cour∣tiers, such as the Earle of Arran and his complices, to move and instigat the King, contrary both to the Word and Oath of God, to usurp the Prerogative of Jesus Christ, who is alone King in Zion, and to in∣vade His Churches Priviledges, purchased for Her with His own Blood, by assuming to Himself in the first and immediat Instance, the cognition of Her Doctrine and Censures: Which though the Church did constantly and valiantly oppose, both by Petitions and Protestations; yet this Wickedness did so impetously proceed, that all at once in a Parliament summarily called in the Year 1582. the Prerogative of Our Lord is trans∣lated upon the King, and his Jurisdiction and Empire exalted over all persons and Causes, the Estate of Bis∣hops & their power and dignity confirmed, & the pow∣er of the General Assemblies of the Church put in the King's hand. We mention not these things with any purpose to debate these questions, which have been moved on this Subject; Only we are confident, that how extensive soever the King's power may be in the case of Reformation (which, Alas! for the most part cometh short of it's reach) yet where a Church is Regularly constituted, and so acting, and by Him sworn to be maintained, no King or Prince ought so far to intrude Himself into Her Power and Priviledg∣es, unto which he is neither called nor gifted, as to assume to Himself a Soveraign & immediat power of judging and discerning upon Doctrine, and her most spirituall Rights and Censures, and thereby in effect not only to constitut Himself a Proper and direct
Church-Officer, without our Lords appointment; but in stead of Papacy so justly abrogated and so solemn∣ly abjured, to erect and revive the same in Himself (a Secular Person) far more absurdly and intollera∣bly. We know that other formalities and notions are pretended, as these of Treason, Sedition, and Disorder, to palliat and colour this Usurpation; but seing nothing spoken or acted by warrant of the Word of God, can fall under the definition or pain of these crimes, and that all Ministers and Ecclesiastick Courts are known, allowed and presumed, both to speak and act according to that only warrant, and Lastly, seing both the warrant is to them committed, and the Church is priviledged and permitted to have it's own proper power and cognition thereanent, as it followeth by clear consequence, that the things questi∣oned, must and ought to be first subjected to her tryal and cognition; so none do deny the Magistrat's just right and power, over both these things and persons, they being once lawfully found to be destitut of the warrant pretended. But seing both Scripture and Rea∣son doth testify against this Usurpation, as most un∣lawful in it self and injurious to our Lord Jesus, and that all experiences have proven it to be most pernicious to His Church & Kingdom, & therefore many of his faithful Servants have worthily and valiantly resisted it, not only to bonds and banishment, but even to blood for the Testimony of their Lord & Master; We return to the purpose of this observation, which is to vindicat the honour of the Lord's Work, and the memory of his faithful Servants, in the discovery of the old malice and subtilty of the great Enemy of the Church of God, working in the wicked Prelats & their abettors; who to the effect they may enjoy their carnall designes, and
prosecute their wicked lusts without controll, endea∣vour mainly by an absolute surrender of all things, powers, persons and interests, to flatter and exalt the King unto an illimited Soveraignty, and pretended Omnipotency, thereby both to oblidge and enable him the more to such acts, deeds, and grants as are requisite for the satisfying of their vain Ambition, insatiable Covetousness and wicked lusts: Which Flattery and Usurpation, being not more agreeable to the vain heart of man, then contrary to the Kingdom of our Lord, and the Power and Purity of His blessed Gospel, what wonder if his faithful Servants (who can neither deny His Name, nor dissobey His commands, by complying with the wicked practices, and the blasphemous flattery of these vile Apostats) be not only hated of all men; but with their Lord and Master become the continual object of the reproaches, violence and cruelty of the wicked, as enemies and rebells to lawful Authority? Now that the World may perceav the wicked intent and design of this Prerogative, that it is none other then that of the De∣vil (as to conciliat and endear the Powers to Prelats, who while they creat the King's Prerogative, pre∣tend themselves to be the King's only Creatures; so to arm and animat the same Powers against our Lord and His followers.) Let it's Rise and Effects both first and last be marked and observed, and the search will declare, that wicked men lusting to Tyranny and licentiousness, are checked and galled by the freedom and power of faithful Ministers in the application of the Holy Word and Spiritual Censures. What reme∣dy? This freedom is found Treasonable, and pre∣judiciall to the King's service and Interest, and the plain Zeall of God is therefore taxed as Sedition and
Treason; and under these formalities, the Priviledg∣es of the Church are infringed, and all the asserters thereof lashed with the same calumny: whereupon and to perfect the cure, the King must be declared IN ALL and OVER ALL; And by vertue of his fained Omnipotency, and for recovery of that Unity and Order, which only the coming of our Lord, His blessed Gospel, and Powerful Ministry is pre∣tended to have disturbed, the Ancient Policy or the Church must be restored; and the greatest flatterers made the Archest Prelats, who by inhaunsing and by destroying the Power, may compesce the (pre∣tended) insolency of the Ministry; and by the con∣tinual pretending of Dissatisfaction and Disloyalty, may terrify men out of all Conscience, until by the introducing of Will-worship and vain Superstitions, they may extinguish all Light, and thereby reduce that Golden Age of Order into stupid Flattery, and of Unity into Implicit Obedience. And if these be not the kind caresses, and most native issues of Pre∣rogative and Prelacy, and the very restoring and re∣establishing of the Kingdom of Antichrist, he who cannot find it in this Period, will find all supplyed by the next. 7. Though we love not to reflect on Events, and know that no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before him, yet seing thereby the Lord's Judgments are made manifest, men ought both to observe and fear. The dissastrous ends of all the promoters of Prelats in these dayes, (viz: of the Earle of Morton beheaded; Mr Iohn Douglass Arch∣bishop of St Andrews dying in the pulpit; the Earle of Arran, after disgrace, privately killed: Mr Patrick Adamson Arch-bishop of St Andrews, after recantation
and disgrace, dying in extream poverty) may justly cause their course the rather to be shunned and detested: But that which we love rather to observe, is, that as the promoters and advancers of Prelacy, were alwayes known to be men of no Principles, and for the most part of very flagitious practices; so the resisters there∣of and favourers of Presbytery, especially the Lord's faithful Ministers in these dayes, were not only very eminent in Knowledg, Piety and Holiness, but a∣bove all had that great Testimony and confirmation, which our Lord Himself maketh use of, Iohn 7.18. that they sought not their own glory, and therefore neither spoke nor did of themselves, but sought His Glory that sent them, and therefore were true and no unrighteousness was in them. As both their slighting of Court favours, by which they were much tempted, and their obstinat refusall of Bishopricks, (whereof King Iames himself bare them witness,) doth Testi∣fy. 8. The Lord, whose Work is perfect, and who when He beginneth will also make an end, hereafter in the Year 1586. shineth through the cloud, dissipateth the darkness, and after the storm blesseth us with a great calm; wherein, the Assemblies re-assuming their just power, and the matter by the King being brought to a treaty and Conference, the Bishops are first Re∣strained, & then Reduced. Thereafter the order of Pres∣byteries being set down & perfected in the Year 1590. both the Nationall Covenant is renewed and subscribed, by Order of the Secret Council at the Assemblies desire; and all the power that remained either in Bishops or Commissioners, by the Assembly is devolved upon the new erected Presbyteries. And thus the Work of the Lord, in the Parl. 12. Iam. 6. bv the 114. Act.
thereof, ratifying Presbyterial Government in all it's Assemblies, Courts and Officers, qualifying and re∣stricting the former Act. 1584. anent the King's Pre∣rogative, and abrogating all Acts contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith, and by other Acts there record∣ed, receaveth it's last and full accomplishment with Power and Beauty, added to the former Grace and Glory. 9. That, as only the malice of Sathan and wick∣edness of men, have in all Ages opposed the establish∣ment of Presbytery; so the Lord, whose great Work and Ordinance it is, doth no less evidently commend it, by making, as on the one hand, it's sincere and holy severity powerfully to coerce and restrain all vice and profanity; so on the other hand, the harmo∣nious and orderly Subordination of it's Courts and Assemblies, most efficaciously to prevent and suppress all Schisme and Heresy: Which both the experience of these and all succeeding times do most clearly con∣firm. But though the Lord had shewed us all these great and manifold temptations and troubles, and termi∣nated them all in such an wonderful and blessed deliver∣ance, that we might for ever fear His great Name, love His precious Truth, and keep His holy Co∣venant; and though in the short Sun-shine of that day of Salvation, He caused both King and People to taste and see the Order, Beauty and Power of that Establishment; Yet, O! how soon did we forget the Works of the Lord? We keeped not His Co∣venant. O Lord, the People of thine Inheritance enjoyed it but a litle. It is not necessary for our design, that we should trace and recount all these sad steps and degrees, by
which the Holy and Wise God thought fit, to bring back his Church in this Land unto that great distress that hereafter ensued, and caused her to wander long in a Wilderness of great Desertion; nor what were the causes and beginnings of that so horrid Defection, (which the Histories of the most partial pens, what∣ever provocations they pretend to be in the Lord's faithful Ministers, cannot purge nor palliat from a mere design of carnal Policy,) carryed on by manifest Disimulation and palpable fraud. It is enough for us, (let the true Histories of these proceedings be examined, and it will appear without the help of our obsevation,) that, as the beginnings of that Defec∣tion were no other then the Unfaithfulness of Man, and the inconsistence of the Wisdom of God with the carnal wisdom of this World, and that old opposition and rooted prejudice of the Kings and Powers of the Earth, who have for the far greatest part set them∣selves, and taken counsel against the Lord and against His Anointed; so for the unquestionable confirmation of all that hath been said, either as to the wicked Rise or woful Effects of Prelacy in this Church, the De∣vil's part therein was visibly to promote his own King∣dom, by re-acting the most palpable and gross Myste∣ry of Iniquity that can possibly be described: In so far as this Apostacy arising from small beginnings, by fair and smooth pretensions, crafty insinuations, Court-flatteries, false calumnies and suggestions, op∣en and gross perjuries, and violent dissorders, ac∣cording to the working of Sathan; After great and long opposition by Conferences, Warnings & petitions, & faithful and constant Testimonies and sufferings of the Zealous Witnesses of our Lord, both unto bonds, banishment, & Sentences of Death, against the again
aspiring Prerogative and usurping Prelacy under it's shaddow, did in the secret and holy Judgement of God, chang the Glory of God and of our Lord Jesus into the Similitude and Image of the Roman Beast, turning the Power of Godliness unto Formality, his faithful Ministers into corrupt Hirelings, the Power and Life of Preaching into Flattery and Vanity, the Substance of Religion into empty and ridiculous Ceremonies, the Beauty and Purity of the Ordinances into Superstitious Inventions of Kneeling, Crossing, Holy Dayes and the like, the Beautiful and Powerful Government of Gods House for the Edification of Souls, to a Lordly Dominion over Consciences and violent Persecution of mens persons; And in a word, the great End of the Glorious Gospel and it's Blessed Ministry, even the salvation of poor sinners, which is the pleasure of the Lord, the fruit of the travel of His Soul, the Joy of Heaven, the Crown and Glory of the blessed Apostles, and the End of all things, and of the se∣cond Appearance of the Great God, into an Empty Title, and specious pretext for the fulfilling of mens lusts and pleasures, the establishing of their Power and Tyranny, and the ruine and exterminion of all such as opposed, and mourned for all these Abomina∣tions. Thus, this Work and Kingdom of Darkness did advance apace, and had almost attained unto it's full maturity, of hurrying this poor Land and Nation head∣long, into that Gulf of Confusion, Error and Supersti∣tion, whereinto Popery did formerly involve us, when it pleased the Lord, according to His Great Mercy and faithfulness, to remember His Covenant though we had fearfully forgotten it; and in the midst of that growing darkness and those manifold Confusions to
cause His Spirit to move, and Light to arise upon this Land, about the middle of the Year 1637. Which ap∣pearing in the former Power and Glory, did from a very small and improbable beginning, even the oppo∣sition of a few weak Women to the introducing and reading of that Carcase of formality, the Service-Book, then ready to be imposed, proceed in such an Univeral, Vigorous, Regular and Powerful method through the whole Land, without the least mixture and ingredient of force and Violence, but only by these most warrantable and inquestionable meanes of Petitioning, Remonstrating, Protesting, and renew∣ing their Covenant with God and amongst themselves, that before the end of the Year 1638. the Work of God was revived with more Glory and Splendor, then ever formerly it had attained. We know that not on∣ly the Renewing of the Covenant, especially with the enlargement explaining the same, in order to the No∣vations in Worship and Corruptions in Government, whereunto this Church had Apostatized, and the bond of Mutual Defence thereto added; but also their Pro∣testings & joynt Petitionings have been condemned as Seditious & Rebellious: But seing the same, both from the clear Word of God, the pure Light of Nature, the Zealous and Valiant Practices of our first Reformers, and the Lawes and Constitutions of the Realme are clearly warranted; And by the Power and Pre∣sence of God were signally approved; and by the supervenient Acts of the King, Parliament, and Generall Assembly so fully established and confirmed; And seing that they only were and are condemned by such, as either being the Children of the Devil, filled with all subtilty and mischief, and enemies of all Righteousness, cease not to pervert the right
Wayes of the Lord; or by such who for advancement of their own Interests, have sacrificed all Conscience and Reason to Ambition and Covetousnes; or by such who in base and open flattery of the King and of the Powers, and neither knowing nor regarding any o∣ther Interest or Concernment, then that which de∣pendeth on their Pleasure, do set and serve the same in place of the most High; Or lastly, by such who never did nor do concern themselves in such enquiryes, but affect a pretended Gallantry in Gallio's Indiffe∣rency, therefore, remitting such as are further desirous of satisfaction, unto the debats & Papers of these Tim∣es, and especially unto the late large Apology, we shall only mention the steps and progress of the Lords Work, and our Engagements therein, according to our first purpose. In the beginning of the Year 1638. great multi∣tudes of people consisting of all Ranks, being awaked by the Arbitrary imposing of a Service-Book, more corrupt in some things then that of England, and the Book of Canons, and the erecting and violent exercing of the High Commission-Court, to the perverting of the Pure Worship of God, the utter subverting of all regular Government, and the confounding of all things Divine and Humane, and the destroying of our Civil Liberties; and conceaving the true cause of all the a∣bounding Sin, & imminent calamities of these Times, to be the violation of the National Covenant, former∣ly thrice sworn in the Land, they again most Solemn∣ly, with a very wonderful & gracious mixture of Tears and joy, renew the same almost in all parts of the Land, with the addition above mentioned, to forbear the practice and approbation of all Innovations in Wor∣ship, or Corruptions in Government, until the same
should be lawfully determined, and that other of Mu∣tual Defence and Assistance, in the prosecution of the ends of that Covenant, against all sorts of persons what∣soever. And in November the same Year, the Gene∣rall Assembly at Glasgow determined anent the foresaid novations and corruptions, disproving and rejecting under these heads, the five Articles of Perth, the Go∣vernment of the Church by Bishops, the erecting of Prelacy therein, and all the Corruptions flowing there∣from, whereby the Oath of the Covenant is clearly ex∣plained and purifyed. In the Year 1639. the Prelats being routed, run to Court,  up the King, England and Irland with all their Friends and Popish partakers in Scotland, a∣gainst the faithful Covenanters, as Rebellious and Se∣ditious Persons: But they having prepared for their own just Defence, the Lord by His outstretched Arm and Power, dispelling all these menacing clouds and imminent storms, doth by a Pacification concluded, reduce a fair calm; The King therein aggreeing that an Assembly and Parliament shall be held, and that all matters respectively shall be therein deter∣mined. The Assembly sitting in August thereafter, the Kings Commissioner being present and assenting, doth ratify the conclusions of the last Assembly at Glasgow, and the Commissioner and Secret Council sub∣scribe the Covenant, as it was then explained; and at the Petition of the Assembly, it is enacted to be again subscribed for the Fifth time, by the Body of the whole Land. But no Faith, Honesty, nor Honor binding the Prelats and a Court by them over-ruled; in the Year 1640. the King and Prelats vigorously arm again, and prepare for a new war: But this intended War is composed by a new Pacification, and in the
mean time, the Parliament (formerly adjourned un∣til Iune 1640) doth conveen at the time appointed, and by their fourth, fifth and sixth Acts fully esta∣blish Presbyterial Government; ratify the Covenant, with the Addition and Explanation of the Assembly, and all Acts made thereanent; & abrogat the Estate of Bishops, and all Acts whatsoever made in their favours. Thereafter, in the Treaty ensuing the Pacification, it is agreed that the Acts past in the last Parliament, with these to be made in the next Session thereof, shall be published in the King's Name, and have the strength of Laws in all time coming: Which Treaty being closed, and the last Session of the above-men∣tioned Parliament sitting in the Moneth of Iune 1641. the King in person being present among them, and the Oath of Parliament (for maintenance of Religion in purity as then established, and of the King's Autho∣rity, and the Peoples Liberties according to the Co∣venant; and for endeavouring by all just and humble meanes, of Union and Peace betwixt the three King∣domes) appointed to be taken by that, & all succeed∣ing Parliaments, being taken; by the second Act thereof, superscribed by the King and subscribed by the President, the foresaid Treaty is amply and per∣petually confirmed, and the whole Articles thereof are ratifyed and recorded. Thus, by all the Security, that either Sacred Oaths; or Acts of Lawful & Authorized Assemblies; Ordinanc∣es of King and Council; doubled and re-iterated Paci∣fications and Treaties; Acts of Parliament Enacted & Re-enacted; the Kings Authority and Consent being often and solemnly interposed, both by promise and hand-writ; And all that either Religion, Truth,
Faith, Honour or Honesty could devise or grant, these Wicked Prelats are cast out of this Church and King∣dom, Presbyterial Government fully established, the pure Worship of God, with His pure and powerful Ordinances and Ministry restored, and in the main∣tenance and pursuance of all these great Blessings, the whole Land, by many Oaths & most Solemn tyes, en∣gaged unto the Lord for ever. By all which Blessings, and the restoring of the Lord's own Ordinances amongst us, as the Work of the Gospel and the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus, in the Conversion of many thousands, were greatly advanced, and the Glory of God, in the abounding of true Piety and flourishing of Righteousness, did eminently shine amongst us; (as the memory of these times in all such as fear God and love our Lord Jesus Christ doth sweetly testify) so all these great things were transacted, to the perpetual shame and confusion of all our calum∣nious Adversaries, without any diminution of his Ma∣jesty's just Authority and Greatness. As the Power and Glory of the Lord was great in this Land; so the splendor and fame thereof reaching unto other Nations, it pleased the Lord thereby to provoke His People in England, at that time grievously groaning under the Tyrannous yoke of Prelacy, and justly alarmed by the imminent fears of prevailing Po∣pery, to set about and intend the like blessed Refor∣mation. It doth not concern us, to reflect on the Causes and beginnings of that War betwixt the King and Par∣liament there, nor what were the transactions betwixt the two Kingdoms in order to that Aid and Assistance given by Scotland, and how the same was mannaged: But this is certain, that, upon the Representation of
the most just and important grounds, of the mainte∣nance of Religion and Liberty, against the prevailing power of Popery, Prelacy and Tyranny in that King∣dom of England; and their most instant and earnest desires for our help and Assistance; and rhe most ra∣tional & clear motives of our own Security, (the haz∣ard and loss whereof had undoubtedly been the conse∣quence of the Prelats Victory there) this Kingdom was induced in the Year 1643. to enter into that Sacred Bond of the Solemne League and Covenant, never to be forgotten, containing no other Articles then every one's Sincere and constant endeavours, in their several places & callings, for the preservation of the Reformed Religion in this Church, in Doctrine, VVorship, Discipline and Government; the Reformation of the same in Eng∣land and Ireland, according to the VVord of God, and the example of the best Reformed Churches; and the nearest Conjunction and Vniformity of all the three in Truth, Faith, and Love; the extirpation of Popery, Prela∣cy, Error and Profanity; the preservation of the rights and Liberties of the People, and of the Kings person and Authority in defence of the true Religion, and the Kingdom's Liberties; the Discovery and the punish∣ment of Incendiaries; the retaining of the Peace and Vnion of the Kingdomes; the mutual assistance and de∣fence of all entering into this League; and the perform∣ing of all duties we owe to God, in the amendment of our lives, and in walking exemplarly one before another: And all these in order to no other end, then the Glory of God, the advancement of the Kingdom of
Iesus Christ; the Honor and Happiness of the King and his Posterity; and the true Liberty, Safety and Peace of the Kingdom. This is that Covenant, which in all the controver∣sies it hath occasioned, did never receave a greater confirmation, then from the malice and opposition of it's adversaries; who in the same Spirit & with the same Spite, have alwayes persecuted and reproached it, with the same Calumnies of Rebellion, Sedition and Blood, which from the beginning, the Devill hath ever been most active to raise and stir up against the Lord Jesus, his Gospel, Kingdom and Followers. But seing such only as are blessed, do evite the offence of Truth; and all who truely seek Gods Glory or Love the Lord Jesus, did and still do heartily approve and embrace this Covenant: though it had brought the Sword not only into Britain, but with the Truth into all the Earth; though it were reproached as un∣friend not only to our King, but with our Lord Jesus to Caesar and all the Kings of the Earth; though it had divided and disturbed not only Realms and States, but with the Gospel, families and nearest relations; and had with Paul moved Sedition throughout the whole World, we ought not thereby to be either shaken or offended. We know also, that all the subtilty and ma∣lice of Hell have been set on work, and spared no ca∣lumny or cavillation, by which either it's Words, Matter or Manner might be impugned: But these are so often and fully answered, and, without the assistance of any man's Patrociny, by the obvious plainness of it's Phrase, the Holiness & Importance of it's Purpose, and the Justice and Necessity of it's way and Manner, so clearly confuted, that nothing can be added. Only
seing the Constancy of Truth, ought not to cede to the Confidence of prevailing Powers, as we have asserted and do hold, the subject matter of this League and Cove∣nant to be in it self Holy, Just and True; so we can∣not but disprove the dangerous Method of some, who the better to enforce the obligation of the Oath of God, do suppose the Matter thereof, especially as to that article against Prelacy, to be antecedently Indifferent, and not determined either by the Word of God or any other Moral Precept: Justly apprehending how easily in this light and backsliding time, such suppositions may become positions; and that the obligation of the Oath of God, now so much violated and little regard∣ed, may be found too weak to secure mens stedfastness. As we are therefore persuaded, and would have all to consider and fix it in their hearts, that this wicked Prelacy and it's Hierarchy, are not only contrary to the Word of God, to the Practice of the Holy Apostles, to sound Doctrine and the Power of Godliness; (under which express consideration we are also sworn to en∣deavour it's extirpation,) but by the sad experience of all Ages in the Christian Church, especially in these our later times, had been found most perni∣cious to all Truth and Righteousness, and the main Engine and Device, whereby the Devil hath alwayes laboured, to advance his Kingdom of Darkness; and therefore hath been the great butt and aime, for the o∣verthrow whereof, the great Work of God in this Land, hath been so Powerfully and Gloriously manifest∣ed: so do we most constantly hold, that as wel this Article against Prelacy, as all the rest contained in this Holy Covenant, were and are antecedently oblidging both to King and People, without the supervention of either Oath or Promise; and that the rooting out of
Prelacy, & the wicked Hierarchy therein so obviously described, is the main duty, in the endeavour where∣of, (as most advantageous unto all these great and holy Ends proposed by the Covenant) all the Zeal of the faithful ought to be concentred. As for such profane Jugglers, who neither consider∣ing this Oath and Covenant as a special Ordinance and blessing of God, whereby we are more effectually stirred up and enabled, to the performance of all the duties of Religion and Righteousness therein contained; nor knowing that this Covenant made with God, and accepted by Him, is also the Lords Covenant with us, for the securing and establishing unto us, all the great Blessings and Priviledges therein expressed, & that, as we therein do avouch the Lord to be our God, so doth He avouch us to be His People, Do from the Righteousness and Necessity of it's matter, vainly ar∣gue the superfluity of any accessory Obligation, and would thence infer, that the same may be the more easily dispensed with or renounced: We de only remit them to that Solemn Covenant Deut. 29.10. &c. made there betwixt the Lord and His People, and thereafter so often renewed, only for their greater Engagement to the most necessary duties of God's express com∣mands. We come in the next place, unto the Manner and Form of this League and Covenant; wherein, not purposing to resume the many debates that have been raised anent it, we shall only take notice, that these old Acts and Laws viz. Act. 43. Parl. 6. of Mary 1555. and Act. 12. Parl. 10. Iam. 6.1585. made against Leagues and Bands contracted without the Kings con∣sent, are now obtruded with the force and lustre of a new Act. cap. 4. of the last Parliament, to condemn the
Covenant, as from the beginning Unlawfull and Re∣bellious: But as these old Acts, at the time of the entering into this League and Covenant, did then stand explained by the 29. Act. Parl. 2. Charl. 1. ratifyed and authorized by the King himself, in a sense most consistent with the Covenant, and could no wayes render the same from the beginning unlawful, much less could the revival thereof in their greatest rigour, or the superveniency of any other Act thereanent, dissolve the Sacred Obligation of this Oath once lawfully con∣tracted; so the reason of the former answer made ro this objection, and the Justice and Equity of that Act. 29. P. 2. C. 1. whereby the same was declared, remaineth in ful force, viz. that no League nor Bond made by the Subjects for maintenance of Religion, Liberty, and the Publick good of Church or State, was or can be understood, to be prohibited by these old Acts and Laws objected. Because, as the makers of such Bonds, cannot be reputed to be movers of Sedition, to the breach of the publick peace, (which is the ex∣press reason and certification of these old Acts ob∣jected) so both the King and his Government, being appointed for the preservation of these great ends and Interests, and He himself principally oblidged, both by the Command and Oath of God upon him, to au∣thorize all such bonds. Covenants, and other means which may advance the same; It were a gross Para∣dox both in Reason and Religion, that the King's ne∣glect of his duty and perverting of his Office, to the overthrow of these ends for which he is ordained, should therefore oblige the People to a sinful Com∣plyance and stupid connivance, to the high Dishonour of the Great God and King of Kings, and the utter
ruine of the souls, bodies, and fortuns of themselves and their Posterity. It's true, it may be and is re∣plyed, that this answer and reasoning, doth proceed from an unjust jealousy of Kings, and is founded up∣on an intollerable presumption in the Subject to censure and judge their actings: But seeing the en∣tering into this Covenant, and into all others which we allow, was so far from proceeding upon an un∣just jealousy, that on the contrary, it was in a man∣ner extorted, by the force of the most palpable and ra∣tional necessity that can be imagined; and seeing the feeling and discerning thereof, is so far from that cri∣minal presumption alleadged, that to disprove it, is in effect to deny both sense and reason, unless our adversaries can prove that notwithstanding there∣of, the King is by God the Lord, vested with such an uncontrollable Dominion and Soveraignty, that whatever Violence, Outrage, or Cruelty he com∣mit, the People are obliged by a patience, or rather stupidity greater then that of Beasts, to endure with∣out gain saying, it is impossible for them to esta∣blish the Tyranny that they contend for. But that the World may see, that such objections are only the wicked flattery of selfish men, and how little they do therein either use or regard Reason, in the late Act a∣bovementioned made against Leagues and Conven∣tions, it is declared, that the explication contained in the Act 1640. viz. That such Leagues and Conventions as are made by Subjects, for the preservation of the King, Religion and the Laws, are not prohibited by these old Acts, is false and disloyall, and contrary to the true and genuine meaning thereof: which Decla∣ration is not only a naked Assertion, and contrary to the express reason and certification of these old Acts,
which is before sett down; but so blind and irrational, that in case of an Interregnum, or the incapacity of the King to give His consent to any Bond, Meeting or Convention, which in such a case may be absolutely ne∣cessary, it leaves no issue or expedient. It is not needful here to clear the necessity and ad∣vantages, which may induce Subjects to the making of Leagues and Conventions in certain cases, without the consent of the Prince; nor the exigence of these Times for the Covenant we plead for: These things are cleared by undenyable Records, which, all the Wars, Blood and Confusions that thereafter ensued, (flowing either from the perverse and obstinate opposition, violence, and Persecution of the enemies of Truth, or being the effect of Gods Righteous Judgement upon such whose hearts were false, and proved unstedfast in His Covenant,) notwithstanding all the present in∣sulting of the Adversaries, doth nothing disprove. Neither do we here resume the above mentioned prac∣tices of our first Reformers, for justifying the case in hand, and the explication of these old Acts here ob∣truded; who, by all their necessary Leagues, Bands and Conventions, never conceaved the same to be con∣traveened: Only we cannot but regret, that, as the Act made in the last Parliament against Conventions and Bonds, was a fearful step of the present great Aposta∣cy, and directly levelled against the same Covenant, by which the Authors of the Acts themselves were and are indissolubly obliged; so that old Act Parliament 10. Ja. 6. cap. 12. 1585. which is thereby ratifyed and re∣vived, was also one of the woful Acts and effects of the wickedness that then prevailed in the Land, and doth relate to and is expresly founded upon the 43. Act. Queen Mary, Parliament 6. 1555. which, under the co∣lour
of discharging Bonds of Man-rent, was by the Queen Regent, then raging in Persecution against the Professors of the Truth, directly intended for the over∣throw of the Gospel and Congregation. We have hitherto only justifyed the lawfulness, or rather the necessity of the Covenant; as a League amongst Subjects without the Princes consent, and have not spoken thereto as a League with England, and the Subjects of an other Kingdom: Because, as the first point is mainly denied by the Adversary; so the same being proven, upon in the same grounds (first, of Just & Necessary Defence of our Selves, Religion and Libertyes; Secondly, of the assistance that we owe and do expect in case of Persecution for Truth, from all Christians in the bowels of Jesus Christ, the obe∣dience of his new and speciall command of Love, and the remembrance of that great and last Judge∣ment, wherein by this Law, all men shall be judged, without respect to the difference of Nations and King∣doms; and thirdly, upon the ground of the Glory of God, which is the great end of all things, and to which all inferiour duties of Submission and Obedience ought to cede) the Justice and Necessity of the Co∣venant and League with England may be certainly con∣cluded. O! that men, who weighing all things in the ballance of their own selfish Interests and designes, do make the vain & airy enjoyment of Court-favour, and the evanishing possession of such advantages, as may be acquired thereby, preponderate and cast the scales, in prejudice of these great and important concern∣ments of the Glory of God, and the advancement of the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus, Might yet be awak∣ened by the terror of that dreadful and glorious Judge∣ment of the last day, to an impartial consideration
of that duty, which we owe to all these that suffer and are persecuted for Truth. Surely if not visiting, not relieving and supporting (when it is in our pow∣er,) of the afflicted members of Jesus Christ, shall then be the condemnation of the Reprobat, (against which the exception of a contrary command of any King or Prince, or that the afflicted were by men for Truths sake declared Rebells and Traitors, or were of an other Kingdome, shall furnish no defence) Can we in conscience think, that the refusal of Assistance to the persecuted for Christ's sake, when instantly thereto required, shall be, upon any of these pretended grounds, excused in that day? We do not here mention the supervenient consent and Authority of the King, by which the alleaged defects, to the acknowledgement of all our adversa∣ries, were clearly purged: because (though the same will afterwards fall in, as a great accession to the conviction of all Apostats, yet) we bless the Lord who hath bottomed our Faith and Consciences upon more sure and fixed foundations; and who gave His People more evident and gracious testimonies of His Favour, Pow∣er and Presence, while they sincerely walked conform to the grounds mentioned, before the King's assent was obtained, then ever since. The entering into and taking of this Covenant, was so much the more necessary and Praise-worthy in us in Scotland, for several reasons, 1. because it contains no other then the same Duties and obligations, which were before by us so solemnly Covenanted to, in our Nationall Covenant: neither is the restriction of our Alleageance, supposed to be made therein, any other then the true and righteous qualification of all such engagements, most consonant unto and approven
by our first Large Confession of Faith Chap. 25. Anent the Civil Magistrate; the Kings Coronation-Oath re∣corded, Ia. 6. p. 1. cap. 8. and the Nationall Covenant, as it was taken and subscribed both first and last: And though our Adversaries have insulted upon the later Confession of Faith, as if both our former prin∣ciples and practises were thereby disproved; yet let the words be considered. Viz. Infidelity or difference in Religion doth not make void the Magistrat's Iust and Legal Authority, nor free the People from due obedience, And we are confident, that no sober man will think the acknowledgement of just and legal Authority and due obedience, a rational ground, to infer that Tyran∣ny over either Consciences or Persons, is thereby either allowed or priviledged; which is all that by us is con∣tended for. 2. Because the same National Covenant did power∣fully oblige us thereunto: not only upon the account of that obstinate opposition, which the perfidious Prelats in England, both by raising Wars and breach of Pacification, had plainly testifyed; the revival whereof, in case of any probable Capacity, we had just reason to apprehend, and by a posterior League, (at that time, a most necessary and probable remedy,) in pursuance of our former engagement, to provide a∣gainst; but also in respect of that express ground of op∣position to the bloody bond of Trent, and of the detes∣tation of all the enemies of Gods Church, who thereby conjured themselves against it, contained in the Natio∣nal Covenant: which could not but be a very fair persua∣sion and strong inductive, to engage in that sacred Bond of the solemn League & Covenant, against that same ac∣cursed conjuratiō, which at that time appeared so active 3. Because the Oath of Parliament, first taken in
the Parliament 1641. the King being present, obliging us to endeavour the preservation of the Peace and Vnion of the three Kingdoms, did indispensibly oblige us to enter in this Covenant, as a most necessary expedient there∣to. Having thus summarily reviewed, both the Matter and Manner of this Solemn and important League and Covenant, we cannot but wonder at the poor Sophis∣ty of such, (especially that more Temporizing then Seasonable Casuist,) who delude themselves in so great matters unto such an Indifferency, as to assert, that this Covenant doth as necessarily depend upon the King's consent for it's establishment, as the private vow of a Daughter in her Father's house, or of an Wife under her Husband's power, in things free and arbitrary, though not absolutely in their own disposal, did accord∣ing to the Judicial Law of the Jewes, fall under the Father and Husband's power of ratifying or annulling: But the simple proposal of these cases, doth hold out such a disparity both as to the Persons, (being only wo∣men under power,) the Things in themselves, being free, but at another's disposal, and many other Circum∣stances tedious to insist on, and even as to Law it self by which the case is determined, being meerly Judicial, that none who fear the Lord, or mind His Glory in any measure of Sobriety, will daigne it with an answer. And such indeed are the rest of the Cavils and Calum∣nies, wherewith the Adversaries of Truth have endea∣voured to impugn and asperse this Holy Covenant; and are so fully and often answered already, that to account them worthy the resuming and refuting, were in some sort after Vowes to make inquiry. There is one thing that our Adversaries have fre∣quently objected, which we cannot ommit, viz. that
the Covenants, both National and Solemn League were urged and pressed, both by Church Censures and Civill Sanctions, of loss of goods, sequestration and other arbitrary pains, which hath been heavily complained of, as a great violence done to Conscience: But as it was then too evident,▪ that this Priviledge of Conscience, was for the most part only pretended by such, as had litle or no feeling thereof; so the Practice of the present times, doth now fully discover, that what is now so insolently retorted, was never before really scrupled at. But the lawfullness of the course and practice then used, and the iniquity of this retor∣tion will easily be cleared, if it be considered, 1. that the Nationall Covenant, being a standing, & binding Oath upon the whole Land, and in the Year 1638. only renewed with such an agreeable explanation, as none could or did quarrel, but such as thereby in∣tended, to palliate and persist in their proceeding ma∣nifest violations, was according to the example of good Josiah, (who brought back the People, and CAUSED them stand to the Covenant of their Fathers, 2 Chron. 34.32.) most justly commanded, and under the pains due to the breach therof, ordained to be re-taken. 2. That the solemn League and Covenant, containing no other obligements, then what the Na∣tional doth import, and being a most conducible ex∣pedient, both for the securing and prosecuting the ends thereof, and whereunto, the National Covenant upon this ground did clearly oblige, The pressing of the same League, is warranted not only by the former ground; but from the very bond of the Na∣tional, became an indispensible Duty: By which rea∣sons, as the former proceedings are clearly justifyed, so the present practice, (as being a direct and violent
ranversing of these things, which were once so righte∣ously and rationally established) is the more con∣demned. But whatever be the disparity of these cases in the point of Reason, we are sure that light and dark∣ness do not more differ, then the Lenity of these former times, from the Rigour and violence now practized; & that where one then suffered for obstinacy against the Covenant, hundreths do now suffer for their stedfast∣ness therein. As for these Wars and great commotions, that en∣sued upon this great Transaction of the Solemn League, we will not thereon insist: Only we are confident, that nothwitstanding all the Calumnious constructions of our Adversaries, al such as seek out and have plea∣sure in the Works of the Lord, will applaud unto the Glory and Righteousness thereof; who, as by the sword of Apostats in the Years 1644, and 1645. He did punish in his Justice, the Hypocrisy and Self-seeking of such in this Land, whose hearts were not upright in His Covenant, and thereafter in the Year 1648. did by a prevailing Sectarian Party, restrain and crush the gross and Generall Apostasy then intended, under an Hypocritical pretext of pursuing the ends of the Covenant, at that time so palpably perverted and abused; so, for the manifestation of his own Glory, and of His Mercy to them that fear him and did not forget his Covenant, He did intermix several gracious Intervals of His aboundant Compassion; and at length did give unto His Work and People, a full and abso∣lute Victory over that malignant Spirit and Party, that had so long prevailed in the Land, and caused the wick∣edness of the wicked to cease, and all iniquity to stop it's mouth. Thus in the Years 1649, and 1650. & thereafter, the
Lord was with us while we were with Him, and while we sought Him, He was found of us; but as we did forsake Him, so did He also forsake us: by which position, all the mixture and varieties, both of our Act∣ings and Gods Providences in these times, may clear∣ly be resolved. There was indeed at that time in the Land, not only a party Faithful unto God, and zealous for His Name; but also a great Zeal of God, from clear knowledge and sad experience, generally and solemnly professed before God and all men in our Publick Ac∣knowledgement Anno 1649: In consequence whereof, the League and Covenant was also by the whole King∣dom renewed that same Year. And in answer thereunto, the Lord did mightily both save and defend us from all our Adversaries: and as He soon subdued our Ene∣mies at Stirling, and turned His Hand against our Ad∣versaries in the North, and caused the haters of the Lord faign submission unto Him; so, for His own Glory, the establishment of His People, and the utter confusion of His Adversaries, He did highly advance His blessed Work, by the accession of all these Advan∣tages, with the Defect whereof, it had been formerly calumniated. The Advantages we here mention are (besides that Publick Acknowledgement then made, and in the deep sense thereof, the League and Covenant solemn∣ly again renewed and taken, whereby our Engage∣ments were not only doubled, but strongly con∣firmed) 1. These many necessary and righteous Lawes enacted in the then Parliaments, both for the ratifying the later large Confession of faith, and the larger and shorther Catechisms, agreed unto by both Kingdoms, and for the restraining and coercing of Im∣piety
and Blasphemy, the encouragement of the Mi∣nistry, and for the promoving of Godliness. Amongst which Acts, that abolishing Patronages, deserveth a more special and commendable remembrance: Not only because of the many woful Effects & Abuses of Patronage, as it then was (& now is) exercised, where∣by frequently, Godly men and in some measure quali∣fied for the Work of the Ministry were (& are) un∣justly restrained from labouring therein; Many Con∣gregations needlesly continued desolate, without a∣fixed Ministry; Many Naughty men and utterly in∣sufficient, at the sole arbitrement of Patrons, violent∣ly obtruded upon the People, without and against their own consent; Presbyteries constrained (contra∣ry to the Rule of the Holy Scriptures) to ordaine men, whom the People neither choised, nor could cheerful∣ly receave; Foundations of prejudice & strife, be∣twixt Pastor and People laid, whereby the one can∣not preach nor the other hear with profit; Symoniacal Pactions often basely made betwixt Patrons & the person presented, to the disgrace of the Holy Calling as-wel as to the sin and shame of the Persons; And the Ministry of too many, in dispencing of Word, Sa∣craments & Censures, made to depend too much upon the Will and pleasure of Man: But also because, it hath no Precept in the Word of God, nor Example in the old Jewish, nor new primitive and pure Christian Church, to warrant it; because, Intentionally and Natively it spoileth the People of that Right and Priviledge, in Electing their own Pastors, which Scripture and Reason alloweth; And because, being the Patron's (pretended) Heritage, and therefore, by him vendible to whom he pleaseth, the whole and sole Power of Presenting of Ministers, Planting of
Churches, Preaching of the Gospel, & settling Mainte∣nance, may be turned over unto, & put in the hands of men, not only Profae & Strangers to both Church & Common-wealth, but also proesed Enemies of the Truth, yea, even Papists or Pagans. And therefore, (being in itself a grievous and unwarrantable Burthen; destructive of the Church and Peoples Liberties; ob∣structive of the free course of the Gospel; the Freedom, Power & Plainness of the Ministry; and occasional of much base Flattery & Partiality, under which, from the very times of Superstition which introduced it, the Church did heavily groan) it must needs be so much the greater Blessing to be delivered from it. The second Advantage which the Lord's work re∣ceaved, was by that great and long Transaction with the King in order to His return, and Admission to the Government; which at length, after repeated Addresses, many Treaties, and the interposing of Forraign States and Princes, produced the King's Ap∣probation and Allowance of the Nationall and Solemn League and Covenant: Which both by his great Oath unto the Most High God, and his hand-writ and Subscription, he most amply assured, promising in the same manner to advance & prosecute their Ends, and to seek and procure the establishment thereof, and of Presbyterial Government, and of the whole work of God in all his Dominions. We know our Adver∣saries, persisting in their old malice, disown and exclaim upon this Transaction as most disloyal and in∣solent, for Subjects (whose part is only to surrender & submit,) to require and enter into Treaties with their Prince: But 1. as these reproaches are from the same wicked Spirit, false grounds, and base and carnall ends, which from the very times of popery, have resist∣ed,
and been objected against the Work of Reforma∣tion in this Land; so do wee thereto oppose, (in full assurance before God and all the World,) these solid and evident reasons and warrants, whereby not only these Treaties and Transactions with the late King, but all these old Contracts and Agreements betwixt the then Powers and People, (which in some sort, are the very foundation of the Protestant Religion in this Realm) are justifyed and approven: wherein if there be any disparity, the difference of a King upon His Throne actually Exercing, from a Prince only ascend∣ing thereto, must cast the advantage on our side. 2. Seing there is no Voluntary Kingdom, which is not both erected, sustained, and continued by a Funda∣mental Contract, and no Right thereto so good (though even that of Divid himself and His Posterity, who held the Kingdom, both by inmediate grant, and interposed Oath of the Most High,) which is not setled and confirmed by this agreement, 2 Sam. 5.3. 2 Kings. 11.17. can any rationall man disprove or condemn Treaties so naturally antecedent and previous thereto. 3. The reason and necessity of this Treaty is so dependent upon the preceeding War with the last King, in which (as-well as in his Kingdomes) this King did succeed him, that, seing it can have no op∣posers, but such as therein were enemies, we willing∣ly refer hoth the cases to the determinations of the same reasons. And as for such who asserting the Cove∣nant, and the Justice of the long Parliaments War, do nevertheless disprove our procedure in this Treaty, as their mis-information doth not prejudge the Truth; so neither are we answerable for their inconsequence. The third Advantage which the Lord gave His Work, was by what the King did after his arrival in
Scotland, both before and at his Coronation, for the greater confirmation of the Covenant and Work of God, and the more strong engaging of himself and this whole Land unto the Lord. Before his Corona∣tion, he emitteth that Declaration at Dumfermling suffi∣ciently known by this designation, wherein Professing, and appearing in the full persuasion and love of the Truth, he repenteth (as having to do with & in the sight of God) His Fathers opposition to the Covenant and VVork, of God, and his own reluctancies against the same, hoping for mercy through the blood of Iesus Christ, and obtesting the Prayers of the faithful to God, for his stedfastness: and then protesteth his truth and sincerity in entering into the Oath of God, resolving to prosecute the ends of the Covenant to his utmost, and to have with it the same common friends and enemies, ex∣horting all to lay down their enmity against the Cause of God, and not to prefer Man's Interest to God's, which will prove an Idole of Iealousy to provoke the Lord, and he himself accounteth to be but selfish flattery, & so-forth proceedeth in the most cordial, sincere & assuring terms, to testify his love and zealous resolu∣tions for God, his People and Covenant, and on the other hand his great dislike and detestation of all Per∣sons, courses and Interests contrary thereto. A De∣claration, so full of heart-professions, and high attest∣ations of the Great God, that none seriously consi∣dering the present times, can reflect thereon without horror and trembling from the Holy Jealousy of the Lord, either for the then deep Dissimulation, or the present unparalelled Apostacy. However seeing the
same is so assertive, that no words could adde to it's assurance, nor no argument less then the present Apo∣stacy, render it to any neutral person suspect of the least dissimulation; sure we are, that the generality of the Kingdom, did thereby obtain all the warrant of the King's most full and clear assent to, and allowance of the Covenant, that either Law or Reason could re∣quire. Thereafter at his Coronation, how the King did again confirm the Covenant, and both He and his People thereby again engage themselves unto the Lord, the order thereof printed and published to the World doth fully declare. In which, these passages are very observable. 1. That the King is desired in Name of the People, jointly to accept the Crown and maintain Religion ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL & SO∣LEMN LEAGUE & COVENANT, to which he declar∣eth his cordial assent, wishing no longer to live, then he might see Religion & this Kingdō flourish in all happiness. 2. After a Sermon most pertinently, plainly and powerfully preached upon that 2 Kings 11. v. 12, & 17. (wherein amongst other things, the binding power & force of the Oath of God, and the hazards of the breach thereof are fully represented) the Action com∣menceth with the King's most Solemn Renewing of the National and Solemn League and Covenant, which was in this manner. The King kneeling and lifting up his right hand before the three Estats of the Kingdom, the Commissioners of the General Assembly, and the whole People and Congregation, by his great Oath in presence of the Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts, he assureth & declareth his allowance of the NATIONAL COVENANT, & SOLENN LEAGUE & COVENANT, pro∣mising
faithfully to prosecute the Ends thereof, and to establish the same with the Presbyterial Government and the whole VVork of God, in all his Dominions. 3. That, having thus taken the Covenants, the King is presented to the People, and their willingness, to have him for their King, demanded; which they ac∣cordingly declare. 4. That he did also swear and take the Coronation-Oath appointed and recorded Parl. 1. Iac. 6. cap. 8. to which both the Covenants are most consonant, Promising by the Eternal & Almighty God, who liveth and reigneth for ever, to observe and keep the same. 5. That when he Sword was put in his hand, he is desired to receave the same For the De∣fence of the Faith of Iesus Christ, & of the true Religion ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL & SOLEMN LEAGUE & COVENANT, & for the Ministration of Iustice; which he accordingly accepteth. 6. After the Crown is set upon his head, the Peoples Obligatory Oath is proclaimed, whereby they all swear by the Eter∣nal & Almighty God who liveth & reigneth for ever, to be true & faithful to the King, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL & SOLEMN LEAGUE & COVENANT. 7. Being installed and set upon the Throne, he is exhort∣ed by the Minister to remember, That his Throne is the Lord's Throne, 1 Chron. 29. ver. 23. And being a Co∣venanted King set thereon, he ought under God to rule for God, and especially to beware that he made not the Lord's Throne, a Throne of Iniquity, to frame mis∣chief by a Law, even such mischievous Laws as have been enacted by his Predecessors, destructive to Religion,
and grievous to the Lord's People. 8. The Nobles of the Land▪ being called one by one, and kneeling be∣fore the King on the Throne, and holding their hands betwixt his hands, did Swear by the Eternal and Al∣mighty God who liveth and reigneth for ever, to be true and faithful to the King, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL AND SOLEMN LEAGUE AND CO∣VENANT. 9. The action is closed by a most solid and weighty exhortation, both to King and People to keep the Covenant, and beware of the breach of it; which is enforced by these fearful threatenings and instances recorded in the Scriptures of Truth, against Covenant-breakers, particularly these, Nehem. 5. ver. 13. where Nehemiah did shake his lap. saying, So God shake out every man from his house, & from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out and emptied, and all the Congregation said, Amen. Ier. 34. v. 18, 19, 20, & 21. And 2 Chron. 24.23, 24, & 25. With this Pathetick application, That if they should break the Covenant, God would shake off the King's Crown, and turn him from the Throne; that he would shake the Nobles out of their possessions, and empty them of their Glory; and would deliver both to the hands of their enemies who seek their life; That breach of Covenant and Rebellion against God was an old and continued Sin in the King's house, which God had al∣ready severely punished: if therefore the King should not acknowledge Iesus Christ King of Zion, who is above him, but break this Covenant, God's controversy a∣gainst the King's Family would be carried on unto the
weakning if not the overthrow of it. And lastly, both the King and Nobles are certifyed, that if the King and they who are engaged to support his Crown, shall conspire together against the Kingdom of Iesus Christ, both the supporters and the supported will fall together. This is that great Action, wherein almost all the So∣lemnities are so twisted with that sacred Bond, that the World must acknowledge, that never King and People under the Sun, became so expresly and strict∣ly obliged both unto God, one to another, & amongst themselves, as we were and are by these most Sacred Oaths of the Holy Covenants, most indissolubly en∣gaged. The fourth and last Advantage, was that plenary and last Complement of all Securities whatsoever a∣mongst men, viz. the Ratification of all these preceed∣ing Treaties, Transactions, Engagements and Acti∣ons, concluded and enacted by the King, then having attained the Age of 21 Years compleat, and the Par∣liament fully and freely conveened in the Moneth of Iune 1651. whereby the same did pass into a perpetual Law: And this Covenant which from the beginning was and is the most firm and Indispensible Oath of God, became at length the very Fundamental Law of the Kingdom, whereon all the Rights and Priviledges either of King or People, are principally bottomed and secured. This is the fair side of the Transactions and pro∣vidences of thesse times, and the effects of the Lord's favourable presence, and the consequence of that Zeal which we have mentioned. O! that we had sin∣cerely minded and walked agreeably to all these En∣gagements, surely our times should have endured for
ever: but seing both our own backslidings, and the Lord's withdrawing from us do evidently testify against us, let us ascribe Righteousness unto our God, that in the remembrance of all these Judgements where∣with he hath punished us less then our inquities de∣serve, we may not only take unto our selves shame and Confusion of face, because we have sinned against Him, and thereby stop the mouth of all these blasphemies and boastings of the Adversaries of the Lord, and His Holy Covenant, which our Backslidings have so widely opened; but in the thoughts of His faithfulness be encouraged to hope in His Mercy, and for the return of our Departed Glory, although we have re∣belled against Him. The Principal Step of our Defection, and the only Rise and Cause of all our Sin and Calamity, we ac∣knowledge to have been no other, then that which is the condemnation of the World, that Light indeed came unto us, but we loved Darkness better then Light, because our deeds were evil. For the Lord did cause His Gospel to shine amongst us, in as great Power and Purity as ever any Nation enjoyed, and by the Advantages of his own Holy Ministry and Go∣vernment, & the accession of our many fold Covenants and Engadgements, did beautify and secure the same unto us; And though that after a long continuance of all these blessings, the Lord by the Ascendent Power of His own Spirit and Glorious Presence, did bring the whole Land under these great convictions, men∣tioned in the conclusion of the League and Covenant, of our not valueing the inestimable Benefit of the Gospel, nor endeauouring to receave Christ in our hearts, and walk worthy of Him in our lives, the only. Duty and
end of all our Covenants and Engagements, which is in effect God's greatest Delight and Glory in the World, and all our Felicity; And unto these unfained resolutions there annexed, of Repentance and Amend∣ment; And lastly though the Lord from Heaven had both plagued us for, and purged us from these fear∣ful Apostacies and Defections, whereby men of cor∣rupt minds, not holding the Head and End of all things, even our Lord Jesus Christ, were both in the Years 1645. and 1648. soon turned aside from their stedfastness in the Covenant, and became Enemies unto God's own Work and Cause, and had therefore stirred us up to the Renewing of our Covenant with God in the Year 1648, with and after a most Solemn Acknowledgement both of the Causes and Evills of these Defections, and a most serious detestation of, and resolution against both; Notwithstanding, we say, of all these things, Yet the great Sin and Evil of not valueing, receaving, and walking worthy of our Lord Jesus. and the not directing and improving the great Blessings of His Gospel, Ordinances, Co∣venants, Victories, and all other Benefits and Enjoy∣ments bestowed on us for the promoving of the Plea∣sure of our Lord, and the Establishing of His King∣dom, for the Salvation of Sinners, did still remain. Thence was it, that the generall and great Zeall which then appeared, was so suddenly contracted to a very few, and much remitted in all: And that mens corruptions, turning former Professions into feigned pretensions, and causing many, (in place of the great and only end proposed) to minde Selfish Designes, and Worldly advantages, the Lord was provoked to give up some to the prosecution of these base desires,  which they had so quickly backsliden; And to
abandon others to the delusion of an over-credulous Charity: which two Evills did so far prevail in all the Transactions of these Times, that though the Over-rul∣ing Providence of the Most High, did bring forth thereof the Advantages which we have al-ready, men∣tioned; yet were Men thereby acted to pursue Trea∣ties, over the belly of most signal Warnings and most pregnant Disswasives to the contrary, and to conclude Agreements, and accept of Securities in the great Matters of God, and of His Work so long contended for, and far advanced, which no rational man not pre∣ferring airy words and professions, and Ink-subscrip∣tions, to plain refusal, visible reluctancies, manifest resilings, open counter-actings, and strong and con∣tinued prejudices, would be satisfyed with, in his own private matters of almost the meanest concernment. But though the Lord from heaven did at Dumbar, testify against both this evil and sinful course, and the great Sin and wickedness that had procured it, and there∣after by many of His faithful Servants did give express Testimony & Warning against the same▪ yet it is stil per∣sisted in: And notwithstanding that by a new disco∣very, after all the assurance contained in the Declaration at Dumfermling that could be imagined, the Lord did make it evident at Clova, that all these condescensions were only the constraints of Policy, the Backsliding and Delusion of these times did proceed, until, that under a pretence of Necessity, preferring the Arm of Flesh to the Almighty Power and Favour of the Most High, and through the perswasion of a Mock-Repen∣tance, only agreable unto that Mock-Treaty whereon it depended, we were induced again, to break the Lord's Commandement and our own Engagement, in joyning with the People of these Abominations; to
provoke the Lord to be angry, until He should con∣sume us utterly without a remnant or escaping; and by partaking of their Sins, became apt and ready to partake of their judgements, which the Lord, by the hand of the TREACHEROUS, did suddenly inflict upon us for all our treachery: And thereby, according to His Righteousness and Great Faithfulness, as he had brought upon us the blessing; so He also brought upon us the curse of His Holy Covenant, and the fears of our own Acknowledgement. These were our Forsakings & Backslidings, which provoked the Lord also to forsake us, and at length to give us over unto, and leave us in the hands of our enemies; and to lay on our necks that long and heavy yoke of forraign Usurpation, under which, from the Year 1651. unto the Year 1660. we did so grevous∣ly groan. The remembrance of which things, doth necessarily oblidge us to the Declaration of these things. 1. That as we desire heartily to resume these pro∣fessions of unfeigned Humiliation (for the undervalu∣ing of the Precious Gospel and slighting of our Lord Jesus Christ) contained in our Holy Covenant, where∣in all the Land without exception are and were so deep∣ly concerned; so (although in the Narration of the procedure of our sinful and Wofull Defection, the particular passages of Self-seeking and Over-credulous Delusion, may import a narrower restricton, Yet) the Lord is our witness, that the pure motive of His Glory, and the Honor and Truth of His Work and Covenant, without prejudice to the persons of any, far less of such, whom we are perswaded the Lord both did, and yet doth honor, to be instrumental in His Work, and faithfull in His Covenant, (though neither in the former practice, or this present per∣swasion,
we do agree) have induced us to this reflec∣tion: which we earnestly obtest, may be looked upon by all, rather as the matter of our mourning then of our censure. 2. That whatever love and sincere respect we retain for such of the Faithful, who (through the Holy and Wise Permission of the Soveraign Lord, by the in∣fluence of particular temptations, or of that general and powerful snare of an Evil Time) were carried on to a Sinful Complyance with the Evil Courses thereof: Yet we are perswaded, that the remitting of that Zeal, sincerity and stedfastness, whereunto, in our Solemn Acknowledgement, upon the most powerful motives, we had then lately so seriously engaged our selves; and the more Politick then Pious management of these Treaties and Transactions; (wherein the advance∣ment of the Work of God, and prosecution of the Ends of the Covenant so highly pretended, could not sincerely and zealously be intended, by any imaginary security or sinful assistance thereby obtained) but espe∣cially the relapsing unto that most sinful Conjunction with the People of these Abominations, so solemnly and lately repented for, and resolved against, (which, in stead of being salved, was, by the Constrained, Politick, Dissembled, and Formall Repentance then used, to the mocking of the God of Truth, and scorn of all our Holy Engagements, on all hands mostly aggravated and exaggerated) these evils, we say, were the very foundations of this present Apostacy, and the grounds of the Lords controversy, which hath so long, and yet doth so greivously pursue this Poor Church and Nation. O! that all men would yet at length, after all the evils and warnings which God hath sent amongst us, seriously consider their
wayes, take unto themselves shame, and give unto God the Glory, before the decree bring forth our utter destruction and desolation. Who knoweth but the Lord would repent Himself for His servants, when He seeth our power is gone, and return on high for His own Glory, and the Congregation of the poor that compass Him about, and render vengeance unto all his adversaries? 3. That neither failing nor backsliding of many of the faithful, nor the wicked Hypocrisy and Dissimu∣lation practized on the other hand, in the carrying on, and concluding of these Treaties, whereby the King was brought under the bond of the Holy Covenant, doth lessen or annul His Obligation thereto; far less the Security, which the People, especially such who know not these depths of Sathan, did obtain thereby, for their warrant and confirmation: Surely the great∣est Aggravation of Perjury, cannot annul the Sacred Obligation of an Oath; nor an intended Falshood, loose the bond of Truth; nor will vile Dissimulation, and the most fearful mocking of God and the whole World, deliver from His Holy Justice and Jealousy, who is a terrible and swift witness against, and avenger of all such abominations. Did the wicked dissimu∣lation and rebellious heart of the Children of Israel, wherewith they entered in Covenant with the Lord, Deu. 29.10. to 28. liberate them from the sin of Apostacy, and all these fearful plagues threatened against it? Did not that Dissimulate promise and engagement of the remnant of the Jewes, made to Ieremiah chap. 42.20. rather hasten and aggravat the punishment of their disobedience, v. 21, and 22? All who love Truth or fear an Oath, do no doubt abhor such wickedness. But the main objection is, that all these condescensions
were extorted by Force and Fear, which doth excuse the Dissimulation, and annul the Oath. We shall not here insist to clear and refute this cavillation, which others have so fully answered: For as to the position, that neither force nor fear, do cause to cease the obli∣gation of an Oath in a matter meerly Indifferent; much less, Holy, Righteous and true (as the matter of the Covenant is) all yeeld. But that neither Force, Fear, nor any other indirect way can be alleadged for the annulling of these engagements, both the preceed∣ing Treaties, the just and necessary Reasons, and all other cicumstances do most evidently confirm; So that the whole World may justly wonder, that these men, who both in profession and practice, do plainly evidence their profane Indifferency, and regardless violation of all Oaths, wherein Interest doth not con∣curre, should by the manifest Patronizing of all Perfidy (whereof no instance can be adduced in the breach of any treaty, wherein the stronger & weaker did ever com∣pose any matter of Right, which is not more justify∣able) & the shamefull disgracing of the King himself, (whom neither Conscience, Honor, Honesty, nor the example of his Father could teach the constancy of the most mean and abject of his Subjects,) should plead & pretend to rational pretext for the present Apostacy, and not rather content themselves, to say with the King in one of his Declarations, emitted shortly after his return to England, that it is well known by what abusive meanes His Majesty was adduced to make and publish that Declaration at Dumfermling, without any more special condescendence, which is impossible. But oh! that the World did also know and consider all the re-iterated Oaths and Subscriptions, High and
Solemn Attestations, Free and unrequired Professions, Fearfull Execrations, made before God, Angels and Men, both in Publick, upon the Throne, under the Crown, in plain Parliament, and also in Private Con∣ferences, which many yet alive can sufficiently attest; by which this poor Church and Nation was insnared, and precipitated into all the Sin and Misery, that since the Year 1650. unto this day, hath afflicted us. How∣ever the Lord, who seeth and heareth, doth also con∣sider, to require it, and the violence done to Himself in many of his suffering members, who partly even in the conscience of the very things, which they that are mostly therein concerned, do mockat, dare not pro∣stitute their Consciences in an ambulatory Complyance, with the wicked Apostacy in these times. 4. We cannot but observe, that after the prevail∣ing, and during the time of the English usurpation, these only, for the most part, remained mindful of, and faithful to the King, who were faithful and stedfast in the Covenant; when as these, who formerly did, and at present do pretend so highly, for the King, in prejudice both of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Cove∣nant, did in their slavish complyance, abandon all Al∣leagance and Honesty, to complement the then Pow∣ers, for the promoving of their own selfish designes, which is the only bond of all their Engagements, and rule and aim of all their Actions. And though many of them do now pretend to have been sufferers, yet it is well known, that if they had had the half of these temptations, which the Faithful upon the account of their alleageance did constantly resist, the Kings In∣terest for their part, had been for ever forgotten, as it was by many of them openly renounced and abjured; And that the main reason of their then seeming and pre∣tended
Loyalty, was the improbability of credit with, and acceptance from the Usurpers, because of their known Naughtiness. Having thus declared the Lords great Work and Glorious Presence amongst us, in all these Mercies and Judgements which he shewed upon us, and these strange Vicissitudes & Alternations, sometimes of His Grace & Power, engageing us with heart & hand unto Himself, sometimes of our own hearts Wickedness and Unstedfastness, again causing us to apostatize and backslide from His Holy Command and Covenant, which, daring the space of an hundred years from the Year 1560, have in the Holy and Wise Providence of God passed over us; that by all these great Tempta∣tions, which our eyes have seen, and the Signs and wonders which he hath wrought, we might know, that the Lord is our God, and Jesus Christ our King; and that by all these things, He only went about to establish us for a peculiar People unto Himself, in the Glorious Light of His Truth, and Beauty of His Holiness, far exalted above many other Nations. We are now come to the Year 1660, wherein though the Lord was pleased according to His Glorious So∣veraignity, by His own immediate hand, to break the yoke of our Oppressors, restore our Covenanted King, Lawes and Liberties, and to make all Factions, Par∣ties and Interests, not only to cede unto, but unani∣mously to conspire for this Blessed Restitution; yet how evidently hath it since appeared, that the Lord had not given unto us an heart to perceave, eyes to see, nor ears to hear, unto that very day. We need not here resume the King's most Solemn and Indissoluble Engagements, which we have so lately mentioned, nor add that after Worcester fight,
and from beyond Sea, he did confirm by private letters to persons of unquestionable credit, that he was, and through the Grace of God would continue, the same man that he had declared Himself to be in Scotland; nor that it was the conscience of that clause of the Covenant, relating to the maintenance of His Person and Authority, which during the times of Usurpation, did retain the sence and love of his In∣terest, so fresh and deeply rooted in mens hearts; Nor that the publick owning, publishing and reprint∣ing thereof by the then Parliament in England in March 1660. was the first Public Act that durst or did appear in his favours; Nor lastly need we remember that Letter written and directed by the King, after his return to the Presbytery of Edinburgh and this whole Church, wherein he declares Himself resolued, by the Grace of God to protect and preserve the Govern∣ment of the Church of Scotland as it is setled by Law without violation; Seing that though according to it's then State and posture, such a Solemn and Publick Assurance might have been reputed a perpetual Securi∣ty; yet the whole strain of the Letter, is such as tendeth only to divide the whole Ministery, and to abuse the greater part of them: And particularly, the altering and suppressing of that most fixed and certain ground of his Engagement, even the Word of God and the Holy Covenant, for that of Law, which is but frail and moveable, did even then discover to ma∣ny, that latent Dissimulation and Instability, where∣by others were either weakly or willingly deluded. The thing we observe is, that both King and Peoples Obligations were not then greater, then the oportu∣nity appeared to be most happy, for the accomplishing
of the Lord's Work, the making of his Name Great & One in all these Nations, & the Nations happy & high above all Nations in Name & in Praise, & the establish∣ing of the King and his posterity upon the Throne in Glory & prosperity, & that the owning of, & adhering unto the Solemn League and Covenant, our Magna Charta of Religion and Righteousness, had both in the perswasion of all sober men, and even in the convic∣tion of the greatest part of our Adversaries, infallibly produced, and effectuated all these blessings. But Oh! how suddenly and strangely was this blessed appearance overclouded, the expectation of all the Godly disappointed, the joy and peace of all corrupted and marred, and this Land reduced unto this present so woful desolation and sore distress, which though the groans, tears, and the Blood of the Per∣secuted, the cry of Violence and Oppression, the De∣solation and Profanation of Gods Sanctuary, the reigning power of Darkness, the Pride, Rage and Blasphemy of Perjury and all Profanity, which hath filled the Land, and the dreadful Wrath of the most Holy and Great God, which both burneth round about, and hangeth over it, do sufficiently make ma∣nifest, yet for our greater upstirring to consider and lay to heart, that all these evils are come upon us be∣cause our God is not amongst us, and what the heat of this great Anger meaneth, & also for the clearing of the Innocency & Testimony of the Lords sufferers, we do shortly exhibite the violent course of this preci∣pitant Defection. The King being returned and re-established in May 1660. the Antichristian Spirit of Prelacy, ever enemy to the Gospel and Kingdom of our Lord Jesus,
and the Holy Covenant whereby the same are promot∣ed, taking occasion from these many troubles and con∣fusions, which the opposition and false-heartedness of many in the same Covenant, did principally pro∣voke the Lord to inflict upon thir Lands, and advan∣tage from the proneness of mens Power to decline unto Tyranny, and their corruptions to all licentiousness, did first most falsely and atrociously slander the Cove∣nant as the Bond of all Iniquity, Rebellion and Con∣fusion, which prejudice being enforced which many apparent advantages that then did attend it, did so suddenly and strongly spread and root it self in the hearts of our Nobles, Rulers, and the generality of the Land, that, without so much as seriously reflecting upon their former so Solemn Engagements, Sacred Oaths, Publick Professions, Vigorous Actings and Appearances for the Cause and Covenant of the Lord, with any consideration of Conscience, Honesty, or Honor, which so great and sudden a mutation from their former wayes, though they had been as wicked, as in effect they are true and righteous, did certainly call for in sober and earnest Repentance, they with the concurrence of such vile Sycophants and treacherous persons in the Church and Ministry, as the worldly wealth and Power of Prelacy had wickedly debauch∣ed, set themselves in a most determined and resolute Fury, whereinto all their former zeal for God is by the malice of Satan suddenly corrupted, by the plain force of Power, and colour of Authority, where∣unto they had now attained, to deface and overturn the whole Work of God, raze it's fundations, annul His Covenants, repeal all Acts made in their favors, incapacitate and persecute all opposers, and lastly to efface and dissolve all sense and bond of Conscience,
by which this fearful course of Apostacy, might be in the least, checked or controlled. We shall not here premise any thing, for clea∣ring of the Unlawfulness of the succeeding Acts and Deeds, whereby this Apostacy was carried on, and for the loosing and freeing of us from all obligation of Obedience thereto, or Complyance therewith: Any who can but suppose, that not only a whole Parlia∣ment but also all men are, and have often been found liars, and compare impartially the things present with the things that are past, must necessarily conclude, that all these Acts and Deeds of Defection were and are Gross Perjury and Wickedness, and that so long as that maxim shal hold, that we ought rather to obey God then Man, they can never be binding either in Conscience or Reason. Seing therefore that the only Rule of these Counter∣actings and overturnings, was to destroy that which the Lord had so gloriously planted, and to loose that whereunto we were and are indissolubly obliged, re∣ferring our selves to what is already said, for vindicat∣ing the Lords Work and our Holy Covenants, we pro∣ceed to lay forth the Sinfulness and Wofulness of this Defection, as follows. 1. In July 1660. by immediate clandestine war∣rants, without any cause signifyed or citation given, the Lord Marquess of Argile and some other Gentle∣men, (who were conceaved to have been instru∣mental in the former Work of God, and that they might be of influence for obstructing of the then de∣signed overthrow thereof) were attached and com∣mitted close Prisoners. 2. In August 1660. the Committee of Estates ap∣pointed by the Parliament 1651. being again set down,
the very first day of their meeting, do violently seise upon several faithful Ministers, peaceably and quietly assembled together, and imployed in the drawing up of a monitory Letter to the King, in the most rational and dutiful manner, and for the most important and necessary Ends, of Gods Glory, and the Kings ser∣vice, that can be imagined, as the Letter it self set down at large in the Apologetick Narration doth testify. And though this duty and employment was no other, then what the meanest subject in the most private capa∣city might, and all were indispensibly obliged to have done; yet those Ministers and one Gentleman with them, are therefore, instantly without hearing, com∣mitted Prisoners. 3. This Committee proceeding to prepare for the succeeding Parliament, (which was all it's work and design) the Parliament siteth down the 1 day of Janua∣ry. Where, having taken the Oath of Supremacy, without respect to it's due limitation contained in the 114. Act. Ia. 6. Parl. 12. 1592. then standing unrepeal∣ed; and exalting the Kings prerogative, upon the alleaged Warrand of the VVord of God and Laws of the Land (but in effect directly contrary to both) above all Offices, Parliaments, Laws, Leagues, Conven∣tions, Peace and War; and likwise upon meer asser∣tions & alleageances in place of declaring upon known and certain grounds (which is all that any Parliament can lawfully do) directly Innovating the Fundament∣al Law & Constitution of the Kingdom, & thereby mak∣ing the Kings Throne, the foundation of all the suc∣ceeding Perjury and Apostacy; They spoil and divest, first, the Solemn League and Covenant, and then the National Covenant, Presbyterial Government, &
the whole Work of God, of all legal warrand and Au∣thority; Declaring all Acts and Practises made and standing in favours thereof, to be void and null: And by the same great Act rescissory, they revive and reinforce all the corruptions and Superstitions of Crossing, Kneeling and the like, introduced by any Parliament since the Reformation. As the Acts of the first Session of the last Parliament do clearly tes∣tify. Although that these Acts have been and are, both in themselves & in their effects, just cause of great asto∣nishment and mourning to all the Faithful in the Land; yet when we remember that height of Wickedness and Profanity that then abounded, and the false, flatter∣ing, & perjurious Sermons & practises, by which the Parliament was thereunto instigated, but most of all that Act that then passed for an Anniversary▪ Thanksgiv∣ing; wherein, as if we had been delivered to commit all this great Wickedness, the Spirit and Work of the Lord are heinously blasphemed and calumniated, as the only Author and Cause of all the Blood, Bondage, Usurpation, Rebellion, Rapine, Violence and other Evils, that either the malice and wickedness of men had caused, or God in his Righteous Judgement had therefore permitted or inflicted; and the Ranversing of our Blessed Reformation, Holy Covenants, and the Righteous Laws whereby they were established, accounted the Restitution of Religion, Righteous∣ness, and Liberties; And the 29 of May, as most Auspicious, appointed for the yearly solemn comme∣moration thereof. (A day, the profane Institution whereof cannot be better demonstrated, then by it's more profane observance and celebration ever since
practised) These things, we say, being considered, do justly adde horror to our astonishment & trembling unto our mourning. But that their practise might be also consonant to their Acts and Statutes, and, by cutting off or laying aside it's most eminent Opposers, the return of Prelacy might be more effectually pro∣moted, in the same Session of Parliament, not only was that Innocent and Faithful one, Mr Cutry, (singled out and signally honoured by God, to bear testimony to the Kingdom of His Son Jesus Christ, His Cause and Covenant, (for no other fault then his faithfulness therein, and his Declining the King's usurped Autho∣rity in prejudice of the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus, and the priviledges of His Church, clearly warranded by 114 Act Parl. 12. la. 6. then standing unrepeal'd, and by a great cloud of faithful Witnesses, who in like manner did testify against this Usurpation) cruelly slain and put to death; But also, under the colour of certain Epidemick crimes, wherein the Soveraignity of Divine Providence, more then any man's malice, had involved the whole Land, others who had been emi∣nent in the Work of God, particularly the Marquess of Argyle, were condemned to death, and forfeited: and several other Faithful Ministers, besides these who were at first imprisoned by the Committee of Esta∣tes, were without any cause signifyed, imprisoned, confined, or otherwise vexed and incapacitated. 4. The rise and re-establishment of this Antichristian Prelacy being thus prepared, in the interval after this first Session of Parliament, the King nominat∣eth and presenteth Bishops; and four of them being called to Court, are there Re-ordained and Conse∣crated: and that in such a manner as doth clearly infer their disowning and renouncing their former Minstery,
and their Warrand & Mission thereunto. In consequence whereof, all the Ordinary meetings of Presbyteries and Synods are discharged, until they should of new be licenced & Authorized thereto by the Bishops now nominated and appointed, and, to the effect that mat∣ters might the better succeed, several of our Faithful Mi∣nisters, upon groundless suspitions, and for refusing of the Oath of Supremacy arbitrarly and rigorously imposed, without so much as admitting such qualifi∣cations, as no Christian ought or can deny, are some of them Banished and others confined. 5. The second Session of this last Parliament sitting in May 1662. by their first Act, they restore and re∣establish Prelacy in all it's pretended Rights, Digni∣ties and Priviledges, but in effect, in it's real Usur∣pations and Corruptions. And for the better set∣ling thereof, and evident declaring to the World, how Erastian and Antichristian this Woful Govern∣ment is, both in it's Rise, Designs and Effects, as by this Act, the Restitution thereof is expresly found∣ed upon the King's Supremacy, as being an inherent Right in the Crown for the disposal of the external Government of the Church, So it is also declared, that whatever the King shall determine with advice of the Bishops and such of the Clergy as he shall nominate, in the externall Government of the Church, shall be valid and effectual, without any other Proviso then that the same be consistent with the Laws of the Realm. But the Absolute Complement of all Wickedness and the Hight of Usurpation, above all that ever the Papacy it self aspired unto, is that which followeth, where∣by the King and Parliament, for clearing all scruples
which may occurre from former Acts and Practices, do rescind all former Acts, by which, the sole and only power of Jurisdiction within this Church, doth stand in the Church, and in the Meetings and Assem∣blies thereof; and all Acts of Parliament and Council, which may be interpreted to have given any Church-power, Jurisdiction, or Government to the Office-bearers of the Church, their respective meetings, other then that which acknowledgeth a dependence upon, and subordination to the Soveraign Power of the King as supream, and is to be regulated and authorized in the exercise thereof by the Bishops, who are to put order to Ecclesiastick matters, and to be accountable to the King for their Administration; And the fore∣said 114 Act Parl. 12. la. 6. whereby the Priviledges, Power and other essentiall Censures given by God to the spirituall Office-bearers in His Church, and war∣randed by His Word are ratifyed, is even in so far and totally cassed and rescinded. And that the World may know how presumptuous and absurd this Usur∣pation is, which cannot be justly conceaved without an instance of it's effects, we here subjoyn that 4 Act. Sess. 3. of the same Parliament for the constitution of a National Synod, wherein the King is made soveraign∣ly and properly to constitute this Assembly, both as to the Appointment of it's Members Constituent, and of it's constant President; the absolute regulation of things there to be proposed (which are declared to be only such as He shall please to signify,) the determina∣tion and limitation of it's Decisions, which are to be agreed to by the President as well as the major part, and providing that they be not contrary to the Prerogative or the Laws of the Realm, And lastly, as to the ne∣cessity
of the King's presence in person or by his Com∣missioner, and of his Ratification and Approbation, without which no Act or Deed is to be of any force. Now let the World consider, what he could have done more in the constitution and regulation of his own Court of Exchequer: And if he hath not done all, as to the constitution of this Court, (immediatly depend∣ing upon our Lord Jesus Christ and his sole Authority) which He Himself hath done or possibly could do; by what warrand or rule, He who is King of Kings will require. We shal not here stand to examine these Acts according to former Laws, Oaths and Engage∣ments, hereby most fearfully violated and contemned; This is a strain of wickedness above all that former times could imagine. O! that God would speak to the Authors, but not in his wrath, and as he hath set His only Son upon his holy Hill of Zicn; so he would cause them to fear His displeasure, that they may yet be wise and instructed to kiss the Son, left he be angry, and they perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a litle. Surely to define, that the sole Power and Jurisdiction of this Church, doth not stand within the same, but in some thing without be∣side our Lord Jesus; and that the same is fountain'd in, and derived from the King; and that all Church-Of∣ficers in all Church matters, are accountable to him, who is neither thereto Gifted nor Called, is to set the King upon our Lord Jesus his Throne, and a high de∣rogation from, and reflection upon him, who hes builded the Temple of the Lord & bears the Glory, & sits and rules both as King & Priest upon His Throne; Who, more worthy then Moses, was faithful and per∣fect as a Son over His own House; and therefore did
not leave His Church destitute, of any such necessary and proper Officer or Assister, when neither King nor Prince was so much as members thereof; And lastly, it's a plain Perversion in stead of Performance of that Promise made to the Church, Isai. 49. ver. 23. That Kings should be it's Nursing Fathers, where in place of Dominion, there Submission is expresly injoyned, they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the Earth. We know that this empty Notion of External Policy, is vainly pretended to colour the matter: But seeing whatsoever can be meaned by external Po∣licy, even as to outward decency and Order, is either particularly determined by our Lord Himself and His blessed Apostles, or under the definition of General and Evident Rules left unto the Churches arbitriment, whereby the King (being no Church-Officer) upon a double account is clearly excluded; and seing that under the pretence of this External Policy, the greatest & most superstitious Novations in the pure Worship of God, and the greatest Corruptions and Abuses both by the appointment of new Officers in the Church of Christ without His own warrand, and the usurping and perverting of the Power of Spiritual Censures in the Government of Gods House, may be and have been introduced, we doubt not, but all rational men do see the delusions of such vain pretences. And cer∣tainly since the Act it self doth proceed, to grant the King all the Power in & over both Ecclesiastick Causes & Persons that can be imagined, it would be but or∣dinary ingenuity in our Adversaries, plainly to assert, that the King is the Great Apostle and Vicegerent of our Lord Jesus Christ, in and over His House: Al∣though they should not only appear herein destitute of
any better warrand, then this present Act of Parlia∣ment; But most plainly to justify al the Usurpation, that ever the Pope or Antichrist, can be charged with. 6. Bishops being thus restored and admitted to sit and give voice in Parliament, this Mixture and the Power of their Antichristian Spirit doth quick∣ly exert it self: And without regard to the nature of Parliamentary and all Civil Powers (which are no wayes conversant about things and perswasions only Internal, and meerly appertaining to con∣science or to the Word of God, which is the ground and warrant, upon which all Power whatsoever being only Declarative, in matters of this kind, ought certainly and expresly to proceed,) They pro∣cure a Dogmatick Act declaring these Positions, That it is lawful to Subjects for Reformation or necessa∣ry Self-defence to enter into Leagues, or take up Arms against the King, and such like, to be Rebellious and treasonable; and particularly that the National Covenant as it was explained in the Year 1638, and the Solemn League and Covenant were, and are in THEMSELVES UNLAWFUL OATHS, and were taken by, and imposed upon the Subjects of this Kingdom, against the Fundamental Law and Liber∣ties thereof. (Which neither they nor all the inven∣tion of Hell, is able to condescend upon or instruct) And therefore, out of the plenitude of their power, (as much as ever any Pope pretended to) they loose the Obligation of Conscience, and free the Subjects of their Engagements: And further, to compleat this their Wickedness, they appoint a Declaration of this
High Impiety, to be signed by all in Publick Trust, that none may be admitted to, or exerce the same, ex∣cept they receave in their right hand or in their fore∣heads this their accursed mark. O! Lord our God, thow art of purer eyes then to behold Evil, and canst not look on Iniquity: VVherefore lookst thou on them that deal treacherously, and holds thy tongue when the wicked devour the man that is more righteous then he? Yet surely O Lord thou hast ordained them for judge∣ment, and O mighty God, thou hast estabished them for correction. Can the World beleeve, that a whole Nation in it's most National Capacity, includ∣ing King, Parliament and the body of the People, should after most clear and evident convictions, and signal Manifestations of the Glory and presence of God, in the most important and holy Concernments of all Truth and Righteousness, most solemnly (as it were) to day engage themselves by Oath unto the Lord, and to morrow, without so much as seriously remembring Gods Holiness and terrible Jealousy, either against these that break His Holy Covenant, or wickedly profane His Name by taking it in vain, at once without any reason or probable motive rendered therefore, despise, contemn and trample the same Holy and Great Engagements under foot, and urge others to the like Wickedness and Impiety? If this tend unto, or shall prove effectuall for the preserva∣tion of his Majesty's Person, Authority & Government, as this Act and statute is entituled, then surely he may break the Covenant and prosper. But this is not all, for these men supposing by this Act, that the Work of God was utterly subverted and overthrown, they
provide also against the fears of it's revival, by declar∣ing all such Gatherings and Petitions that were used in the beginning of the late Troubles, though the same be no other then that common priviledge of all men, which Slavery it self (much less Subjection) doth not take away, to be unlawful and seditious: And furder do statute and enact that no person by VVriting, Printing, Praying, Preaching, or malicious and ad∣vised speaking, express or publish any words or sen∣tences to stirre up the People to the dislike of the Kings Prerogative and Supremacy, or of the Government of the Church by Bishops, or justify any of the deeds, Actings or things declared against by this present Act. By all which, not only the Security of Religion and the Liberty of the Subject is utterly subverted, by pro∣hibiting of the lawful, most necessary and only means of asserting thereof, in case the same should be in∣vaded; but we are also denyed and prohibited the li∣cense, so much as to mourn and pour out our prayer unto God, either apart or one with another, for all this Horrid Apostacy, or our heavy persecutions for non-complyance therewith; So that the most inno∣cent of all remedies, Petitioning and Prayer, and al∣so the meanest and last of all comforts, even the Tears and Complaints of the afflicted, (which God and Nature hath hitherto placed beyond the reach of all cruelty) are now severely forbidden. 7. By the third Act of the same Session of Parliament, under the pretence that Patronages, being the just & proper right of these concerned, were unjustly abolish∣ed in the Year 1649. notwithstanding that the same
were only, in so far as they were burthensome to the Church of God, and obstructive to the Work of the Gospel, then abrogated; and in lieu thereof the civil Interest and benefit of Patrons more amply extended and secured; yet on purpose that they might cast out and remove such faithful Ministers, as notwithstand∣ing all the wicked Acts and Practises then made for the overthrow of the Work of God and Presbyterial Go∣vernment, might have by their stedfastness (at least) put some demur to this impetuous Defection, they statute and ordain, that all Ministers who entered to the Cure of any Parish, in or since the Year 1649. have no right unto, nor shall possess any benefice or stipend for that same current Year 1662. or any Year follow∣ing, but decern their Kirks and Benefices Ipso Jure vacant: And then under pretext of favour, they clearly discover the design and snare intended, in de∣claring that every such Minister who shall obtain the Patron's Presentation and Bishop's Collation, betwixt and the twenty of September then nixt following, shall have right to his Church and Benefice, as if at his entry he had been lawfully presented, otherwise the Act to stand in force against him. By which means this same Parliament in their first Session having enacted, that no Patron should present, or Minister Presented have right, except they should first take the Oath of Su∣premacy, the very body and strength of the Ministry of this Church were reduced to this sore Dilemma, ei∣ther to take that Oath of Supremacy, which both by express Acts and clear Practises, was now declared and interpreted to be the very height of Papacy, and root of Prelacy, and by accepting of Collation, to
acknowledge these perfidious and usurping Prelates, or to lose and be cast out of the Ministry, likeas, de facto 300. and upwards of the faithful Ministers, were by vertue of this Act shortly thereafter outed and vio∣lented from the Exercise of their Ministry. 8. The Prelates not having attained their full in∣tent by this last Act, do further prosecut their design of casting out, and incapacitating all such as either re∣mained or might rise up to oppose their wickedness, and therefore they procure, 1. an Act of Parliament without either Citation or Reason alleaged or rendered, against the faithful Ministers of Edinburgh, (who, being eminent lights, were also from the advantage of the place apprehended as more eminent opposers,) discharging them of their, Ministry, and ordaining them to remove themselves and families out of the Ci∣ty, after the 8 of September then next to come. 2. By the fourth Act of the same second Session of Parlia∣ment, to the effect that not one faithful Minister might remain to witness against their Defection, they statut and enact, that all Ministers, for Testifying their ac∣knowledgement of, and complyance with the present Government by Prelates, keep and observe the Bishops Visitations and Diocesian Assemblies, and be assistant to them in all Acts of Church Discipline as they shall be required, under the pain for the first fault of Suspension from Office and Benefice, and of Deposition if they should not amend. We are not here to redargue such lukewarm Newters, as, by the subtilty of a vain di∣stinction deceaving & being deceaved, under the pre∣tence of innocent submission, do actually Assist, Par∣take,
and Comply with that wicked Prelacy, which they are sworn to Extirpat; and at best, can only pre∣tend to keep the Covenant by that detestable Neutrality, which, they have therein abjured; Their growing Backsliding will quickly declare and free them of this imputation of Neutrality. Our regrate is for the faith∣full, who are thus by the Perjury and violence of such who of all men ought most to patronize them, not on∣ly outed of the Ministry by Deprivation from Bene∣fice or stipend, but declared by a Parliament, a Civil Court, deposable from their Spiritual Office, as in∣consistently and absurdly as if the same Secular per∣sons, who were authors thereof, had by the same Act stept into their pulpits. 3. By the same last Act, in imitation of Julian the Apostat, who found not a more effectual and Devillish invention for suppressing & destroying Christianity then the shutting up of their Schools and Colledges for learning, they ordain for the poysoning of all the springs and fountains thereof, that none teach or rule in an University or Colledge, except they both take the Oath of Supremacy, and sub∣mit to, & own the Government of Prelacy, & that none be permitted to teach any School, or to be a Paedagogue to Children without the Prelates licence. 4. By the same Act, they not only prohibit any to Preach in publick or in families without the Prelats licence; but advancing & pursuing their malice & persecution unto these very San∣ctuaries of rest & refuge, which even in former times, (when the proud were called happy, & such as wrought wickedness were set up, yea they that tempted God. were delivered,) the Lord did provide and reserve for his Own, wherein they that feared him, and thought upon his Name, spoke often one to another, and
the Lord hearkened and heard it; they under the pre∣tence, lest the People should thereby be alienat from their Lawful Pastors (as they call them) who in effect are Wolves and Thieves, discharge all Private Meet∣ings in houses for Religious Exercises, which might tend to the prejudice of the publick Worship in Churches: Under which qualification, all Christian Fellowship and Society, amongst such who cannot o∣vercome their just aversion from these Churches and publick Meetings, which these Apostat Prelats have prophaned and polluted, and whereunto they have wickedly intruded, are prohibited and reproach∣ed. 9. By a Proclamation emitted this second Session of Parliament, they again enjoin the observance of that Anniversary Holy Day, the 29 of May, even the Moneth and Day which they had devised of their own heart for a feast unto the People: And to the effect they might the more infallibly attain their purpose of Outing all faithfull Ministers, they subjoin the certi∣fication of Deprivation of Benefice, or Stipend, against all such who should not, (because in conscience could not) observe it, like as de facto, severalls, who could not in conscience satisfy themselves either as to the Authority or Reason of the appointment, are there∣fore without Citation or hearing, Outed of their Benefices and Stipends for that Year; and the same either immediatly ingathered by the common Colle∣ctor, or gifted to some other. 10. In the same Session of Parliament, pretending that the whole Land, (a few only excepted,) were notourly and heinously involved in the crimes of Trea∣son and Lese-Majesty, through no other cause nor oc∣casion,
then our most Necessary, Righteous, and Lawful entering into the Solemn League & Covenant, and prosecuting the holy ends theirof, once so signally owned and countenanced by the Lord, and so fully Authorized by all the Law & Security that can be ima∣gined (for, as for the English Usurpation, few were guilty of Complyance therewith, who were not also most forward in this Apostacy, and the very vilest and worst of such had been declared an honest man by an express and particular Act of the same Parliament) they appoint a packed close Committee, wherein the generality of the faithfull to the number of about 800, (not adding a hundred more who by private resentment or upon some other prejudice were listed in this roll) without citation or any cause signifyed, or any manner of tryal taken, were most arbitrarily Fined, and for the most part in such pecuniary mulcts and summs as it pleased the malicious suggestions of the delators to impose, and in many particulars so absurdly, the some∣times the same person was found twice fined under divers stiles in diverse Shires, and others were left blanck either in the Name or Surname, who might be filled up either for one person or another, as the best conjecture should determine; and others were fined, who were dead long before, or were Infants, and Mi∣nors under age, and others who to this day could never be found. If this be the righteous judgement which the Lord doth require, let the world declare. Surely this Act is such as hath no precedent nor fellow, ex∣cept that other Act of Billeting, whereof, as the Pow∣er and Interest of some persons against whom it was intended have by an after Act sufficiently discovered it's Irregularity and absurdity; so until the like disco∣very as to other Acts may be obtained, it may evident∣ly
enough declare what manner of Power and Reason did over-rule this Parliament: But these two Acts being past, the Parliament proceed to declare by their Act of Indemnity the Kings special Grace and Goodness, in pardoning such whom only the Parliaments own Apostacy, and unparalelled Rebellion against the God or Heaven, made criminal, excepting for the most part only such who were most Innocent. 11. This Session of Parliament being ended, the Council go about the execution of the Acts therein concluded, especially against the Ministers not ob∣taining Presentations, and by their Act and Proclama∣tion at lasgow emitted, the 1. day of October 1662. they command all such Ministers to remove themselves forth of their respective Parishes, betwixt and the — day of November then nixt ensueing, discharging them thereafter to exercise any part of their Ministerial Fun∣ction within the same: what and how great the iniqui∣ty and rigor of this Act is, we will not stand to declare. Certainly, he who commanded his Apostles to pray that their flight might not be in the Winter, did regard and doth remember the great distress which many poor fa∣milies then sustained, who, being deprived of lively∣hood, turned out of doors, indigent and very nu∣merous, might according to the cruelty of their ad∣versaries have starved and perished. We need not here insist upon the particular steps, whereby the rest∣less jealousies of these wicked Prelats, did urge for∣ward and advance this Presecution, by their impe∣trating of reiterate Acts and Proclamations, until they obtained that last Act and Proclamation, concluding and adjudging all these Ministers unto such a nice and impossible Confinement, which not only the necessi∣ty
of humane frailty, and it's dependance upon many indispensible conveniences, do render more rigid & in∣tollerable, then the most strict imprisonment, and the most barbarous banishment; but also the most curious skill of the most exact Geographer can scarce make practicable: It is enough for us to note, that having, by a posterior Proclamation, extended the same pains unto all Ministers outed upon whatsoever ground of non conformity to this present course of Apostacy, (in which condition all the faithfull Ministers in Scot∣land a very few excepted, are included,) there were ne∣ver so many Innocent and Faithful Ministers, in any Christian Church at once and for such a cause reduced to such hardships, fears, and uncertainties, and that by such persons, who not only are as deeply & solemn∣ly sworn and engaged as they are, in the same Cause and Covenant, for which they suffer, but by such who once (some of them at least) appeared to have had the zeal of God, so that if it had been possible they would have pluckt out their own eyes, and have given them to such, whose Enemies they now are, only be∣cause they tell them the truth: Such is the fearful snare & prevailing Power of Apostacy; but God seeth & telleth their wanderings, and putteth all their tears into his bottle. Having, because of the necessary connection of these things, thus represented them together, we return to the third Session of the same Parliament, and its Acts, Where 12. By the first Act thereof, they ratify the former Act anent Ministers, who entered in, and since the year 1649, and such who keep not the Diocesian meetings, and do recommend to the privy Council the effectual execution theirof, and to call all such Mi∣nisters, who dare to preach in contempt of that Act to be
punished as Seditious persons, and also to be careful to remove and dispossess such who should be Suspended or Deprived for non-conforming, declaring that if they thereafter presume to exercise their Ministry, they should be punished as Seditious persons. Thus, in the height of Perfidy and Violence, men under the pre∣text of abused and perverted Authority, proceed to dare and presume against God, their own Conscienc & all their Sacred & Indissoluble Oaths and Engage∣ments, and to persecut such for preaching, who, standing stedfast therein, and having a dispensation of the Gospel committed unto them, by him who is King in Zion & higher then the Kings of the Earth, may & out to contemn the menaces of vain Man, in regard of that heavy and severe woe sounding in their ears, if they preach not the Gospel; But the Act doth furder proceed, to require of all, a due Acknowledgement of, and hearty Complyance with the Kings Govern∣ment Ecclesiastical and Civil, and therefore to ordain and declare, that who ever shal ordinarily and wilfully withdraw and absent themselves, from the ordinary Meetings for divine VVorship in their own Churches on the Lords day, whether upon the account of Popery or other dissaffection, shall incurre, each Heritor the loss of a fourth of that years rent, each Yeoman the loss of a fourth (or under) of his moveables, each Burgess the loss of his Liberty and Burgeship with the fourth of his moveables, and concludes with a reference to the Council for further punishment, & more effectual exe∣cution, likeas in order hereunto the Council by several
Proclamations since, have so much intended the se∣verity of this Act, that every Parish in stead of having a Lawfull Pastor, is now inslaved to a Graceless, Violent Hireling as it's Lord and Master, and to the extortion of Souldiours appointed for his Executioners and Exactors. We shall not here debate the Lawfulness or Unlaw∣fulness of the Obedience here required, only for the vindication of many thousands of the Faithful, who by their sufferings have born Testimony against this Act; we add, 1. that waving the ordinary & captious maner of proposing the question in the terms of Hearing or nor Hearing, which strickly taken, are not the subject there∣of, we are assured that none seriously pondering the obli∣gation of the Oath of God, sincerely, really & constant∣ly all the dayes of our life to endeavour the extirpation of Prelats and their dependants, but they will acknow∣ledge, that the owning of, and submitting to the Apostat Curats according to this Act as our Ministers, is most diametrally opposit thereto: Can we Lawfully Own such whom we are bound to abhorre? Or Sub∣mit to such whom we are bound to extirpate? Surely this were to rebuild what we have destroyed. 2. That though some nimble Sophisters, who fear not after vowes to make inquiry, can and have swallowed both Owning and Submitting as not repugnant to the duty of Extirpation, yet, seing the direct contrary there∣of, is by the terms themselves very significantly im∣ported, and that these terms were for this express cause and design particularly elected and made choice of by the Parliament, for ranversing of the Obliga∣tion of the holy Covenant, no sober man will be tempt∣ed by their delusion to think, either that Owning and
Submitting signify no more then Simple Submitting, or that that Active Assenting and Complying Submis∣sion here mean'd, is no more then that Stil and Passive Submission, unto which men by the force of inevitable necessity, and against their wills are oftentimes con∣strained. 3. That whoever pretending to enter into the Ministery, doth presumptuously contemn and despise the sacred Rule and Order of Entry appointed by the great Shepherd, cannot be reputed to enter by the Door, nor to be so much as Externally by him Sent or Called: But such as do enter by gross and pal∣pable Perjury and wicked Violence and Intrusion, do without question contemn the sacred Rule and Order of Gods Word, so that to admit such to be so much as Externally Called were to make the God of Order the Author of Confusion, and him who is the Truth, the favourer of Perjury. We know that this notion of an External Call is conceited by many, to be no other thing, then the performance of such Rites and Solemnities, as are prescribed to the Admission of a Minister, done by such a Person or Persons, on whom the like hath been performed; but seing that by many instances of gross Disorder and Violence, (which are obvious for any man to suppose,) many absurdities might be hence inferred, and that to be Externally Called ac∣cording both to the meaning of Truth, and the import of the words is, to have such a Visible Evidence of the Call of Iesus Christ, as in Reason and Charity doth ob∣lige all men to receave the person so called, as truely sent; Certainly if any Person force his own Entry into the Ministry by open and profane Contempt of the Rule and Order given by our Lord Jesus, he doth in like maner as palpably disprove any Evidence of a Lawful
Call, which he can pretend to, & no man is obliged either to Beleeve him to be Called or to Receave him as Sent. Which things are so evident in themselves, that whoever denyeth them, is obliged by the same consequence to affirm, that if Simon Magus had in his horrid wickedness purchased the Apostleship by mo∣ney, the Christian World had been bound to Receave him as an Apostle. 4. Though we are not to lanch out into these depths, how the Soveraignity of Divine Pro∣vidence hath suffered Churches to fall away into Apos∣tacy, and again recovered them, and if during these times of Apostacy a standing Ministry still continued, or how long it did; if not, what way it was revived and raised up, in which cases true Faith in Jesus Christ which is the substance of all, and a conscientious walking according to the measure of the times, doth certainly purge and sustain many things otherwise chargeable with Informality; Yet of this weare con∣fident, that it hath alwayes been both the sin and mi∣sery of all Apostatizing Churches, that they have not resisted the beginnings of Defection, and when the Authors theirof did prove incorrigible, though for∣merly Ministers, that they did not separate from them, and account them as Heathens and Publicans, which course, if duely and zealously observed, had undoubtedly put a great stop and hinderance to the rise and wicked Usurpation of Antichrist, all whose ma∣lice and violence without the delusion and complyance of such who ought to have resisted them, had never proven so effectual. 5. That a man may be a Mi∣nister, and yet not a Minister unto all, so as to oblige them to receave him as sent to them, which may be intuitively understood beyond the light and power of any demonstration, if we but suppose the case of a
particular Congregation, living under, and acknow∣ledging their own lawful Pastor, & that amongst such, a few violent persons arising, bring in another Minister by plain force, and cast out their lawful Pastor, and if it be sincerely resolved what the faithful in that Church are then obliged to do, surely none will think that they ought instantly to relinquish their true Pastor, & own & submit to this Intruder, but on the contrare all must grant that they ought to adhere to their lawful Mi∣nister & not only discountenance & withdraw from the Usurper, but by all lawful means endeavour his Ejec∣tion; which case, if but translated to the present con∣dition of this oppressed Church under usurping Pre∣lates, will with the same evidence resolve the question. 6. That whatever construction or interpretation many to whom it is given to believe but not to suffer, may put upon their hearing of the Curates, as to the inferring or not inferring their owning of, and submission to their Ministry, yet this is certain, that as it is the most probable argument and presumption of owning that can be alleadged, so is it that which this Act requires for to testify both a due acknowledgement of, and hearty complyance with the present Government by Prelates, and as an undoubted evidence of the peoples giving their cheerful Concurrence, Countenance and Assistance to the Curates. 7. That seing hearing of the Curates by the acknowledgement of all the more ingenuous is not a duty to which they are moved by conscience, but rather used by them as a thing though lawful yet arbi∣trary, for the eviting a greater inconvenience, & seing that this Act and every article theirof is undoubtedly gross and wicked Perfidy against God and his holy Covenant, commanding the disowning and relin∣quishing the Lords Ministry whom we are bound to
maintain, and the owning and encouraging by hear∣ing such vile Intruders as we are bound to extirpate, thereby designing expresly to involve all as much as is possible in the same Perfidy, and to loose the former obligation of the Oath of God; whatever may be said in the case abstractly considered, yet we are perswaded that being thus stated, not hearing becomes a case of Testimony, and an indispensible duty. 8. That as it is the sin and misery of all declining times that the zeall of God is at the best rather wished for as a Bless∣ing, then minded as a Duty; so we are confident that the true and right zeall of God should, and would not only inspire all with an unanimous Aversion against the the profane intruding Curates, but animate us as one man to drive away these Wolves and Thieves, and to eradicate these plants which our heavenly Father never planted. 9. That though the Curates could instruct and justify their External Call, yet such are their lies & lightness by which they cause the people to erre, & the visible truth of their vile Perjury and Prophanity, which they preach and practise, that all serious ob∣servers may easily discover them to be inwardly raven∣ing Wolves under the sheeps cloathing of an pretended external call, of whom in conscience of our Lords command all ought and should beware. 10. That what∣ever may be the difference in these things even amongst the faithful, yet all must aggree and acknowledge that the violent pressing of such to hear, who upon such pro∣bable grounds from a tender sense of conscience do only plead that Christian, innocent, & most safe priviledge of a peaceable forbearance, is not only contrare to that ample promise of Indulgence to tender consciences made and declared by the King from Breda before his re∣turn 1660. but is in effect to violent all conscience, and
the hight of oppression and rigor. 11. That as the grounds laid down may and do sufficiently answer all objections, so therefrom may be shortly cleared, first, that common and ordinary Sophism, that hea∣ring and observing the Ordinances is an indispensible Duty from which neither the wickedness nor frailty of the Minister doth loose: But as it may be easily an∣swered, that this when acknowledged doth rather suppose then inferre the complexed lawfulness of hea∣ring Curates as Ministers, and that their Ministry is the Lords Ordinance, which is plainly denyed; so we are also to consider, that such duties and per∣formances are only acceptable unto the Lord, spe∣cially in the matters of his Worship which are in∣tirely sound and wholly agreeable unto his will, truely done, in spirit, and altogether performed in truth, Nam boum est ex omni causa, hence it is that the pro∣phanity and wickedness even of the Lords lawful Priests, let be the Perjury and Profanity of wicked In∣truders, have not only caused the People to abhorre the offering of the Lord to the Priests heavy charge, but evē the Lord himselfe to abhorre his sanctuary, & to account incense an abomination, so that he cannot away with the calling of assemblies, it is iniquity even the solemn meeting; shall it then be accounted iniquity for to hate that which the Lord hates, and withdraw from that which he hath forsaken? Ought we not rather to distinguish a holy abhorring from a profane con∣tempt, though both of them proceed from the Cu∣rats sin, and in the sense thereof rather wish for, and withdraw with Jeremiah unto a cottage in the wilder∣ness, that there we may mourn for all these abomina∣tions; surely were there no more in this matter but that Holines becomes the house of God for ever, and
men of clean hands and a pure lip ought to draw near and turn unto him, it were sufficient to justify the Lords People, who in drawing near to God, cannot in conscience either regard or make use of the mouths and hands of these Apostates which are continually filled with lyes and violence, as either sent by the Lord to them-ward, or to be imployed by them to God-ward, 2. From these grounds may be cleared that grand objection from our Lords command to the People of the Jewes, Matth. 23. ver. 2, 3. saying, The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses seat, therefore whatsoever they bid yow observe, that observe and do. Whence some inferre that even such as without a title do usurp the office of teachers ought notwithstanding to be both heard and observed; but it is answered, 1. That it neither appeareth from the words nor yet from any other Record, that the Scribes and Pharisees did by in∣trusion possess themselves of Moses chair, but on the con∣trare, as by Moses chair is only understood the Office of teaching, resolving and judging according to Moses law, to which although the Levites were appropriate, yet is there is no such determination thereanent in the Word of God, as can by any manner of inference reject the Scribes & Pharisees as intruders, so it is more presuma∣ble (that, seeing our Lord in that long Legend of evils & woes pronounced against them, doth not in the least charge them with Intrusion, but rather acknowledge their Vocation by calling them the Builders) they had thereto lawfully attained. 2. As our Lords Words bear no command for the People to hear, but only to observe and do what they heard, rather supposing then allowing that, which though for the time he endeavoured to im∣prove to the best advantage, yet afterwards he intended not only to reform but utterly to abolish, & therefore
cannot in reason infer a command & duty to hear the Curates; so neither our Lords tolerance in this case can so much as infer it's lawfulness, except the cases were duely stated & compared, which if any will rationally do, by first supposing that the Scribes and Pharisees had then lately by gross Perjury and Violence thrust out the Lords Teachers & intruded themselves into the Office, we are bold to affirm that our greatest adversaries dare not in this case assert, that our Lord would so much as in the like words here used have insinuat a simple toleratiō 13. Hitherto we have only observed the progress of these Acts that directly tend to the overthrow of Pres∣bytery, and the erecting of Prelacy, but as by the vilest of Flatteries and most presumptuous of Usurpa∣tions, Soveraignity is puffed up and exalted to that Supremacy, which is the necessary & only foundation of Prelacy; So it is no wonder if both in the righteous Judgement of God, and through the influence of this wicked Prelacy, the stay of lawful Authority become a yoke of Tyranny, and that these Prelates, who make an absolute surrender of Religion, Conscience & all Sacred Concernments, for the gratifying, and to the arbitriment of these Powers whose Creatures they have often Atheistically acknowledged themselves to be, do with the same and greater profusion subject both Laws, Liberties and the Fortunes of others, to the lust of the same Powers, which they may so easily pervert unto their own establishment and advance∣ment: And this indeed is and hath alwayes been that great aggravation of our later Prelacy, rendring the same worse and more intolerable: then the Romish Hierarchy, which being wholly dependent upon the Pope, another and distinct head, and not upon the Civil Power, whose interests are oftentimes not only
distinct but directly opposite, it hath neither that ac∣cess, nor influence to abuse Princes; Whereas our Prelates deriving all their Power and Being from the Kings Supremacy by endeavouring for their own bet∣ter establishment to render him incontrollably absolute over and in all things, they being otherwise mean and abject persons, having the least and almost no share nor interest in the Commonwealth, and by reason of their ill Right and worse Conscience in what they do possess, being alwayes cruelly jealous, have by sad experience ever inclined the Government unto Tyran∣ny; and as in this late and worst Catastrophe they have more prevailed then ever formerly they did, so the following instances do more clearly demonstrate this assertion. We shall not here repeat these Acts whereby for the better and more easy establishment of Prelacy then designed, this Parliament for it's first work under pretence of vindicating & declaring the Kings Just Right and Prerogative, did in effect wholly corrupt and in∣novate the well tempered and firm constitution of our Ancient Government, which both all our Ancient Histories and Records, the only evidence whereby fundamental Laws are verifiable, do sufficiently de∣clare, and the long continuance and endurance thereof, excellently commend. The first thing that thereafter occurs, is that Act and offer of fourty thousand pounds Sterling to the King yearly during his life, whereby in place of that relaxation from these burdens which the iniquity of Usurpers had only from time to time im∣posed, a lasting and perpetual Imposition, by it's con∣tinuance fully exequating the excess of the former, is entaild upon us, and that for no other end then the complementing of a few Favourites of Prelacy, and
the maintaining of a Military Force over us, for their & the Prelates security, & the persecution & slavery of the body of the people opposite thereto. The 2. thing is that rigid, irregular & exorbitant Fining which we have already mentioned, clearly & unquestionably carried on & executed, by the same Authors & for the same De∣sign. The 3. thing is that humble tender made to the King of our duty and loyalty, wherby in recognizance of the Kings prerogative, and in a further acknowledgement of our duty, the Parliament by the 25. Act, Session 3. do subject the Persons, Fortunes and whole strength of the Kingdom to the Kings pleasure and arbitre∣ment, in that humble (indeed, but also blind and in∣considerat) offer of 20000 foot Men, and 2000 Horsmen sufficiently armed with 40 dayes Provision, to be ready upon the Kings call to march to any part of his Dominions for opposing whatsoever Invasion or Insurrection or for any other service: Which offer, though possibly many do account it but a voluntary and cheerful expression of that readiness, which our Ancestors have often witnessed for the defence of King and Country; yet in effect, if duely considered as concluded under the force of a Statute & Act of Parliament, in place of that willingness and readiness alleadged, whereunto our Ancestors were from time to time determined, by these visible and appa∣rent exigencies of the common concernment which did require it, it will be found no other thing, then an im∣plicite and slavish Emancipation of our lives and liber∣tyes, to the arbitrement of the Powers, coloured with the pretext of loyall devotion to lawful Authority. But whatever is herein exorbitant, is without question the proper effect and product of the jealousy of these Apostate Prelates, whom the inward disquiet of an evill conscience, causeth to apprehend terror round
about. The 4. thing, wherein this wicked prelacy hath perverted the Ancient and well constitute Govern∣ment of this Realm, is their procuring, erecting, and exercing the High Commission Court, (without so much as the approbation of that Parliament wherein nothing would have been refused them, wherein not only Ecclesiastick and Civil Jurisdiction are absurdly confounded, in impowering secular persons to suspend and depose, and pretended Church-men and Ministers to fine, confine and incarcerate, but the Act. 131. Parl. 8. Iac. 6. discharging all New Courts not appro∣ven in Parliament, directly thereby contraveened; nei∣ther will the Catholicon of the Kings omnipotent Pre∣rogative salve this breach, in respect the same Prero∣gative, now in so great vigour, was by the 129 Act of this same 8 Parl Iae. 6. and almost immediatly pre∣ceeding the Act alleadged, then also recently enacted. But who can consider the Arbitrary form of Inquisition and summar procedour without any shaddow of Legal Process, used in the same Commission, it's tyranny and unwarrantable exacting of Oaths and subscriptions, with it's new invented, insolent and affronting punish∣ments more cruell to ingenuous Spirits then death it self, and not be convinced of the gross and wicked corruption of this State-novelty, or rather monster? The 5. thing which offers, is the accumulation and in effect the suppression of the ordinary Offices of State (the very stay and props of regular Government, and the conduits and channells whereby it's refreshing in∣fluences are diffused) with, and by an extraordinar and superlative power and Office in the single person of the Kings Commissioner. Certainly as in the multitude of Councellers there is safety, so on the other hand no King on earth can rule by such an deputation, who may not as
lawfully alienate his Crown: Which devices are all the inventions of these wicked Prelates, who knowing that if the King should either hear, see or act, but by such ears, eyes, & hands as they do assigne unto him, their affairs could not long prosper, do by such exorbitancies endeavour the establishment of their own Tyranny. The 6. thing that occurs is not only the keeping up of a Military Force to the intolerable burden and slavery of this free Nation, in so far as the ordinary and civil manner of Legal Execution, specially for Fines and Ecclesiastical Delinquencies is now committed to, and managed by Military Force and Violence, and thereby the manner of exacting often times rendered more hard and insupportable then the exaction it self; but also that for satisfying the restless jealousies and endless fears of the evil consciences of these Apostate Prelates, more and greater forces under the vain pre∣tence of Forraign fears, which both the then condi∣tion and posture of these Wars, the dis-proportion of the Forces themselves, and the disposal of such as be∣fore were leavyed did clearly redargue, have been lea∣vyed, and are kept on foot, for maintaining whereof the Publick Revenues are mis-applyed, the Fines, when by the Kings favour long delayed, at length ex∣acted and expended, new Taxations imposed, far exceeding the quantity of any formerly required, and at length the old Assessment the great grievance of the late Usurpation of new superadded, and the poor Country and body of the Land in it's greatest poverty subjected unto, oppressed and harrassed by more inju∣rious extortions then ever the Conquering sword of an Forraign Enemy did heretofore, or can probably li∣cense: And all these things clearly intended and carryed on for no other end then the support of this wicked
Prelacy, and it's cruel Bondage and Spiritual Tyran∣ny. We need not mention for an aggravation of these violences, that these Forces were leavyed by the imme∣diate procurement of the Perfidious Prelates, without the advice of the King's Council, (ever from the begin∣ning, what ever may be the present exaltation of Prerogative, reputed to be one with the King, and who both by Place and Interest are therein indispen∣sibly concerned) seing it is not the least of the iniqui∣ties and calamities of these times, that the poor Na∣tion and it's greatest Concernments are by them so base∣ly abandoned. But this we must take notice of, that though our Adversaries, by reason of the disastrous Events that lately have happened, do now boast of a most special Providence and fore-sight in all these op∣pressions; yet it would be more just and rational on their part, to acknowledge that as oppression doth even make a wise man mad, so to see a free Nation, by the Perfidy and Insolent Domineering of a few up-start Prelates, and the violence of their wicked and slavish Favourites, reduced to the condition of a most insup∣portable and unnatural Conquest, both was, is, and ever will be a most just cause and provocation to all ingenuous Spirits and true Patriots, to undertake the asserting of their own Liberty, upon the greatest hazard. Having thus truly and fully represented the exalta∣tion of Prerogative and Prelacy, over and above all things Divine and Humane, Sacred or Profane, we shall briefly adde the bitter and cruel fruits and effects of this sinful and woful Conspiracy. 1. As the Laws above mentioned, enacted for the overthrow of Presbytery and the Restauration of this accursed Prelacy, specially in so far as concerns the
Ministry, were and are such as did inevitably infer, either a sinfull complyance with that Perjury and Apos∣tacy whereby they were framed, or the endurance of the pains and sufferings thereto subjoyned; so almost the whole faithful Ministers, are thereby first and last not only deprived of their benefices and livelyhood, ejected out of their respective Parishes, and by immi∣nent & visible force incapacitated from the exercise of their Ministry, but some of them are Banished, others Confined, and the remnant reduced to such straits, fears and uncertainties as we have before represented. Then might we have seen the shepherds smitten, and their flocks scattered, our teachers removed into cor∣ners, and the Lords Vineyard and Sanctuary laid most desolate: so that in some whole Countreyes and Pro∣vinces no preaching was to be heard; nor could the Lords day be otherwise known, then by the sorrowfull remembrance of these blessed enjoyments whereof now we are deprived. Oh! though we had not the zeal & courage of our Ancestors, to have set our selves for the defence of the Gospel, and the maintenance of the Lords Ministers and Ordinances, of which we were so perfidiously and violently spoiled, yet that at least we had remembered, by Prayer and Supplication to God, in the dayes of our afflictions and of our mise∣ries, all the pleasant things that we had in the dayes of old. 2. As this Antichristian spirit did at the first disco∣ver it selfe, in that height and rage of Prophanity and all Excess, which suddenly overspread the Land, and did very powerfully and evidently usher in the Restitu∣tion of Prelats; so the same hath been ever since by them not only tolerated, but greatly countenanced and encouraged. We do not here mention their gross and
wicked Toleration of Popery, whereby in thir few years it hath increased to a greater hight then ever it at∣tained at any time in this Land since the Reformation, & that though it hath, & doth appear in that daring confidence, as in its avowed idolatrous Masses and seminary Priests amongst us, to contemn and despise these ancient and standing Laws whereby such things are often and severely prohibited under the pain of death, yet to this day never one hath been publickly questioned and charged upon that account. The thing mostly to be noticed is, that the only grievance and eyesore of Prelates is Conscience and any measure of Tenderness therein; Thence is it that the most inno∣cent and peaceable Forbearance in not bearing Curates and the like, have been persecute with all rigor, where∣as Adulteries, Blasphemies, Swearing and Drunken∣ness are so far from being punished or restrained, that the Committers thereof are now only the persons most in fashion and favour; yea it hath been known and can be instanced that persons conveened, and que∣stioned, as disaffected, have either upon the discovery or information of their Profanity and dissoluteness, been instantly and freely dismissed. Oh that men and Chri∣stians do so litle remember our Lords own rule to judge and discern false prophets by their fruits, whereby he hath expresly said that we shall know them, and that men are so far blinded and bewitched, as not to see the mighty working of Sathan in this Mystery of Ini∣quity, endeavouring under a meer shaddow and pre∣tence of Formality, to root out the Power and Life of Religion and Conscience, and to reduce this poor Church unto that Laodicean luke-warmness more desperate and incurable then coldness and death it self.
3. The faithful Ministers being outed, and the hedge of Presbyterian Government removed, as pro∣phanity and wickedness doth yet more abound, so there came out of this smoak, Locusts upon our Church, even a crue of Curates for Insufficiency, Vanity, Lies, and Prophanity, the very Scorn of Re∣formation & Scandal of Religion. We need not here adduce particular instances, there is none who in the least observe their doctrine and maner of conversation but will easily acknowledge it: And the certainty of what we here affirm is so obvious unto all, that a par∣ticular condescendence would either prove an infinite labour, or too much abridge the extent of so sad a truth. Its true there are some who being convinced, and others who supposing the truth of what is here al∣leadged, do either doubt or deny these; things to be the proper effects of Prelacy, but rather of the licentious∣ness of men, and such accidents which may be incident to the best constitutions: But if it be considered, 1. That that thing which inseparably and infallibly attends ano∣ther, may with more then ordinary probability be con∣cluded to depend thereon by a certain influence: 2. That that which is no Ordinance of Jesus Christ, but the visible product of the Devils malice and mens pride and lust, can never be effectual for the establish∣ing of Truth, or promoting of Holiness. 3. That such who not only discover in themselves the foresaid evils, but by open and most notorious Perjury do u∣surp and invade and hold the Offices they pretend to, must of necessity hate the light because their deeds are evil; it will be very easily granted that Prelacy, Pre∣lates, and their dependants, to whom all these things are clearly applicable, are not only the proper causes and authors of all the Prophanity and Wickedness under
which this poor Land now perisheth; but most natu∣rally introductive unto all these Superstitions and Abo∣minations, wherein the Devill by the same means did, and hath involved the Christian World under the Ro∣man Papacy. 4. The Prelates and Curates being thus established, from the ground and warrant of the Acts mentioned, several Proclamations and Edicts, for the more effectual execution thereof and pressing conformity thereunto, & for the suppressing conscientious adherence to, or (so much as is possible) the very remembrance of our for∣mer Engagements and Covenants, and the holy Ministry and Government therein contained, are emitted and published. We have already mentioned that at Glasgow, and these others to the same purpose which did ensue upon it. The first what we here note is, that the Prelates conceaving that their perse∣cutions already practized and to be practized, might excite the compassion of some to a charitable sup∣ply of the afflicted; more to express their cruel malice then really to hinder that, which at best is not worth the noticing, under the pretext of Disrder, they procure a discharge of charitable Collections. And now let it be here observed once for all, that such is the cruelty, not only of the malice but of the very Acts, procured by the Prelates against conscientious Non-conformists, that if they were followed with a suta∣ble & compleat execution, there should remain no com∣fort to any abiding stedfast, other then that of Arca∣dius mercy to the children of Traitors, that life should be their grief, and death their relief. There was ano∣ther Proclamation emitted, at the time of the first plant∣ing of the Curates, that all persons should keep their own Parish Churches, and should not repair to any other ex∣cept
in case of vacancy, under pain of twenty Shillings Scots totis quoies, to the effect that such as could not in conscience attend the Curats Conventicles, might be also deprived of any mean of edification, which the opportunity and neighbourhood of a faithful Ministry might afford. Then thereafter there is another Edict published against unwarrantable Preaching, Praying, or Hearing, whereby even such Exercises, without which the Communion of Saints can hardly be inter∣tained, are restrained & discharged; in so much, that if a faithful outed Minister should repair to any private fa∣mily, or two or three moe then the Domesticks of one House be found together, though only imployed in the most Christian & edifying Exercises of Praying, Lec∣turing or Godly Conference, their meeting is declared an unlawfull Conventicle, and all such as are accessory, punishable accordingly. By a fourth Proclamation, men are required to be assistent to, and concur with the Curates in the exercise of Discipline, as they shall be thereto called, though they be not told either by what warrant, or in what capacity they are to meddle in the Matters of God; for our Adversaries do both disown Elders, & allow Deacons no rule. There is a fifth Procla∣mation discharging all Conventions & meetings whatsoe∣ver under the pretence of Religion, which are not allowed by Authority, certifying all persons accessory, that they shall be looked upon and punished by pecuniary and corporall pains, as seditions persons, at the arbitre∣ment of the Council, and especially that the Ministers ex∣ercising therein, and their resetters or countenancers in any sort, shall be liable unto the highest pains due to seditious Persons. And lastly, there is a sixt, com∣manding
all Masters of Families to cause their Ser∣vants and all their dependents, and all Heritors and Landlords to cause their Tennants and Tax-men to obey all Acts of Parliament or Council enjoyning Con∣formity, and particularly to frequent their Parish Churches, and to submit and conform to the Curates their Ministry, or else to remove them summarly from their service, and eject them out of their Possessions: And also that Heritors take bond and security of their intrant Tennants in time coming, that they and their Cottars and Servants, shall give obedience as said is; and lastly, that all Magistrates of Burghs cause their Inhabitants give Bond for the like obedience; for which effects, these Heritors and Magistrates are warranded to charge them under the pain of Rebellion: And who∣soever shall contraveen this Edict is certified and de∣clared lyable to the same pains due to the Non-confor∣mists themselves, for whom he hereby is made answe∣rable. This is the last Act & Proclamation for Con∣formity not only in course, but even in the utmost of extremity and rigor, whereby, as many persons ha∣ving a freedom as to their own practise, are further urged, contrare to all the rules of charity and modera∣tion, to compel others towards whom they may ra∣ther desire a Christian Forbearance and Indulgence to be used; so the generality of the Land without any ex∣ception whatsoever, are reached, and obliged to all the Complyance with, and Conformity to this wicked Apostasy, and accursed and abjured Prelacy, where∣of they are capable, and that under such Pains, as if
generally incur'd and execute, should infallibly reduce the Land to utter Desolation and confusion. But the Lord heareth and regardeth, and Oh that men would also hear the voice of this poor Church, that bewail∣eth her self and spreadeth out her hands, saying, VVoe is me now, for my soul is weary because of Mur∣therers. 5. As we have observed the Tyranny and Illegali of the High Commission granted for executing these Ec∣clesiastick Acts and Edicts, both in it's Constitution and Procedor, so we do furder observe that whatever Novelties and Extravagancies the Commssion it self contain, yet the Practises of the Court, having no other Precedent in the Christian World, save that of the Spanish Inquisition, do far exceed them. For 1. as persons are brought before them, either by Seisure or summar Citation without any cause signified, but to answer super inquirendis, contrary to an express stand∣ing Law Iac. 6. Parl. 10. cap. 13. 1585. which was also enacted when the Kings Prerogative was fresh and in full vigor; so at their Compearance, they have neither Libel nor Accuser, but are constrained instantly to make answer to whatsoever question the arbitriment of the Archprelat pleaseth to demand. 2. As there is no time for advice permitted, so neither are lawful De∣fences receaved or admitted; but if any person do of∣fer to propone any matter of that kind, he is required first to take the Oath of Supremacy, or some such En∣gagement or Subscription which they are assured he wil refuse. Thus a Gentleman of the Name of Portefield, being conveened before them, and questioned for not owning the Curate, he answers, that his not hearing the Curate, could import no disaffection, nor bring
him under the compass of the Law, because the Cu∣rate had calumniated him by such vile opprobries & re∣proaches, as were both scandalous in a Minister, and just ground of resentment to any ingenuous Spirit, as he was able to prove by sufficient witnesses: This the Court having sustained as relevant, and the Gentle∣man having adduced his witnesses, and one of them being examined and clearly proving, all further pro∣cedor is stopped, and he required to take the Oath of Supremacy, which he having refused, they sentence him in a great Pecuniary Fine, and confine his person far North, to the Town of lgin. 3. If any person conveened do clearly answer all their Questions & De∣mands, so that he cannot be in that manner reached, then they require him in a most Arbitrary way. either to take the Oath of Supremacy or some other subscrip∣tion for obedience to Ecclesiastick Lawes, or any other bond or security they please to require: In which their Tyranny they are so inconsequent, that they neither remember that Lawes are made to be Obeyed and not subscribed, and that Obedience is secured by their own sanction, and not by the Peoples handwriting, nor that the main objection by which they thēselves do impugn the Covenant, & whereon the Declaration against it, is expresly founded, is that the same was taken by, & im∣posed upon the Subjects of this Kingdō against the sun∣damental laws & liberties of the same which is not more fals if applied to these holy Covenants, (which were expresly founded, both upon the Word of God, & the free consent of the body of the People, & most necessar∣ly intended for the glory of God & the defence of Reli∣gion & Liberty, which are the foundations of all founda∣mentals, besides the accession of both Law & Authority by which they were warranted) then true and evident in
order to the case in hand, it being most certain, that whatever may be the extent of the Peoples Surren∣der under any Constitution; for the enforcing of their Obedience or Submission, yet the liberty of Per∣suasion is so undoubtedly understood to be reserved, that it cannot be abridged by any imposed Oath or Sub∣scription, without their own consent. We know the Council hath both the power, and is in use to take Bond for keeping the Peace, but this is a practice so clearly warranted by Law, and so antecedently sound∣ed in reason and humanity, upon just and probable pre∣sumptions, to secure the Peace by bond, which they might do by the persons imprisonment, that the parity is alleaged with as litle reason, as the pra∣ctice controverted is voyd of equity: Notwithstand∣ing of all which, there is but one course before that Commission-Court, without mitigation either to Ba∣nish, or Fine, or Confine (or both) the persons re∣fusing. 4. If any do in his answers or demeanor of∣fend, or be discovered thereby in the least to be guil∣ty, they proceed to sentence without any breathing or intermission, wherein they so litle observe the War∣rant of their Power and Commission, that they of∣tentimes exceed all the proportion either of Law or Reason: For verifying whereof, let but the instances subjoined be considered, where we shall find persons 1. Stigmatized and Banished for not conforming, which neither their first nor second Commission, bearing only Power to ine, Confine and Imprison, nor the Laws whereupon they could proceed, give warrant to do. We know the first Commission that was printed, was afterwards renewed with some exension & not printed, but though some copies thereof in write were spread abroad with power to stigmatize and banish, yet
neither doth the Principal contain any such warrant, nor can the extension therein made, infer the same in any sort, without admitting that the same Court con∣sisting of many members constituent of the Secret Coun∣cil, might Proteus-like transfigure themselves into this form in a moment. 2. We shal find men sentenced not only to Banishment, but to Deportation and Sla∣very, viz. to be carried to Barbadoes, where, being poor men and not able to redeem their Liberty, they must undoubtedly be sold; a punishment, which not only the disproportion of their delinquencies, but the whole tenor of our Laws, and the undoubted Privi∣ledge of Christianity, doth reprobate and condemn. These things duely considered and compared, it will be more then evident, that our Oppressions and Grie∣vances by reason of this Court alone, do far exceed all the pressures and injuries of that Spanish Inquisition, whereupon the United Provinces have justified and ap∣proved their revolt from under the King of Spain, to all Protestant States and Churches. 6. As these Acts and Proclamations are very Wic∣kedness; so their Execution hath been only Rigor and Cruelty, It were endless to enumerate all the distresses that have hereupon ensued upon particular persons and Families, unto the imprisonment of many, confine∣ment of some, deportation of others to remote Islands, chasing of others to sore and anxious wanderings, & scattering of Families unto beggery. Any who can conceave the Wickedness and Violence that did prompt the Prelats to the making of these Acts and Statutes, the arbitrary Power of the High Commission by which they were enforced, and the rage, violence and ra∣pine that attends Military Force by which they were and are executed, may possibly conceave some part of
these evils; which, lest the strangeness thereof do render altogether improbable to men unacquainted, we shall here subjoin a few instances of many, of the Procedors of the High Commission Court, leaving these of Military Force unto a more proper place. The Parish of Anrum had been in former times under the blessing of Mr John Lvingson his Ministry, who being banished the Kingdom for no other cause then his emi∣nency and stedfastness in the Work of God, and re∣fusing the Oath of Supremacy, there is obtruded by the Bishop upon them in his place, one Scot, an old excommunicate urate, continuing under that sen∣tence and in his wickedness that procured the same, for which cause mainly, he is now complemented and rewarded with the accession of this Kirk and Benefice, to two others, which he still brooks & enjoyes, though very far distant from this place. This man coming a∣mongst them, such as feared the Lord, and remem∣bered his Work and Covenant, are stirred up in the Zeal of God to testify against his Intrusion, whom, being a Person excommunicate, entering by gross Perjury, without their consent, and only seeking af∣ter the fleece and Benefice, all that love our Lord Jesus and the prospering of his pleasure, were bound to abhor and detest: We do not justify any excess of human pas∣sion that might here have been admixed with the sin∣cere zeal of God, which we are certain in it's worst appearance all men ought rather to excuse, then there∣fore condemn that duty, to which not only the People of that Parish, but the whole Church of Scotland were and are in a higher measure indispensibly obliged in opposition to the present course of Apostacy, and for extirpation of the Apostat Prelates. However four men of the Parish are conveened before the High
Commission, where being examined they acknow∣ledge, that Mr Scot being to preach at Ancrum as their Minister, they found themselves pressed in conscience to declare to him their dis-satisfaction with his entry, and that they were present with the rest of the People which were there at that time. This the Commission, contrary the opinion of the more sober & most knowing amongst them, take for a confession of guilt, and im∣mediatly proceed to sentence them, as cntemners of the Ordinances, to be scourged through the Town, sug∣matized with the tter T at the Cross of Edinburgh, and thereafter imprisoned, and with the first Ship to be carried to the Barboes Islands. All which was accordingly performed upon them. Thus judgement is turned in∣to gail, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock. But God who sustained his servants with that constan∣cy & courage, that neither the shame nor pain of scourg∣ing and burning, hindered them openly and audibly to rejoice in the Lord, who counted them wothy to suffer for his Name, beholdeth also mischief and spite to requite it with his hand. For the same alleaged crime, shortly thereafter they sentence two Brothers, married men, to be carried to Barbadoes, and their siste, a young woman, to be scourged through the Town of Jedburgh. As for alleaged conventiling, there is one Mr Smit, a Minister seised upon and imprisoned, for no other cime then preaching to, and praying with a few secretly assembled for fear of the Pelates, in the Name of the Lord, without the least offence objected from any thing there spoken; who being brought be∣fore the Commission, and in his examination and an∣swers to the Bishop of St Andrewes, calling him only Sir, without Lord or Grace, he is therefore taxed by the Com∣missioner, to whom he answered very respectfully,
(giving him his accustomed titles) that he knew he was speaking to Mr James Sharp once a Minister as he himself is. Whereupon there is so great offence con∣ceaved, that the Commissioner did immediatly ordain him to be carried by the Town-Hangman to the Thieves Hole and there laid in the Irons, in company with a Fuious Fatuous person, who was there loose: An In∣dignity so great, unusual and insolent, that although He had behaved himself not only rudely in his demeanor, (which is the worst that his Adversaries can charge him with) but had been most flagitious in his life; yet no∣thing but that Spirit of Spite and Rebellion that rageth Apostats, could prompt Christians to inflict upon one, who had ever carried so much as the Title of a Minister. But because the open Iron-grate, whereby this Hole is shut, gave too great access to the charity and com∣passion of many persons who came to visit him, he is therefore upon the third day thereafter carried up to the Iron-house within the Tlbooth, & continued in his irons and fetters, and thereafter in close Prison, until by sentence of the same Commission, he was banished and confined to Shetland, the coldest and wildest of all the Scots Islands; where he was to expect no other com∣fort, then the company of some other faithful men, who for not owning and submitting to the Curats, had been carried there by sentence of the same Court. And as they did thus sentence a Minister for Exer∣cising, so the same Court having conveened before them an honest private man . . . Black, for being pre∣sent at an alleaged Conventicle, but in effect, at the meeting of a few Christians for praying and hearing the Lord's Word, without so much as any other offence pretended; because, according to the example and warrant of the Primitive Christians, he refused to
give His Oath, & thereupon to delate the names of such as he knew to have been present, and because he was not liberall in giving St Andrewes his titles, the Commissio∣ner ordaineth him to be scourged thorow the Town; although it was well known to the Court, that his in∣formation could give very small evidence, and they were convinced, that his refusal did not flow from contempt of the King's Authority, but meerly and purely from scruple of Conscience. These are a few instances of many particulars of this kind which might be alleaged, whereof there is no corner in the whole Countrey, nor Parish almost in the West, which cannot give evidence; and therefore we do remitt any more ample confirmation of these things, until we have noted a few moe particulars for clearing thereof. 7. As we have observed the Wickedness of these Ecclesiastick Laws, and the iniquity and irregularity of the Act of Fining, and the introducing of Execu∣tion by Military Force; (a servitude unheard of and in∣tolerable in any free Nation) so the evils and oppres∣sions thereof can scarcely be numbered. For 1. Upon pretence of that Proclamation, commanding People to keep their Parish-Churches, and prohibiting the re∣pairing to any other, except in case of vacancy under the pain of 20 shillings Scots toties quoties, the soul∣diours being disposed upon, to such places which are known to be most averse from this course of Apostacy, lying at catch for their own advantage, have often taken the opportunity, where there was but one Church in the bounds still enjoying a faithfull Minister, and ma∣ny vacancies about, to go and beset that Church in the time of Divine Worship to the profane disturbance thereof: And thereafter either to cause call some old roll of the Parishioners, and exact the Fine of twenty
shillings Scots of all others without exception, or respect even to the licence contained in the Proclama∣tion it self in case of vacancy, or to require an Oath of every person to know to what Parish they belong, and that at the Church door without permitting them to come forth, until they either give their Oath or pay the Fine, not only with such cursing, swearing and confu∣sion, as would make Infidels amazed to see the Lords day so profaned, by Christians professing the same com∣mon Faith; but with such rigor, by taking by force the Bibles or garments from some poor persons, who have not wherewith to pay, and insolent beating and wounding of others to the effusion of blood, as may justify the greatest Barbarity. We need not instance particulars in a truth so universally known. We pro∣ceed to another kind of this same violence, practised in other places where Curates are planted; who, to force and compel the people to that complyance with their Ministry, which in conscience they are bound to abhor, cause form lists or rolls of such as keep not the Church, and calling them after sermon, both Men and Women by Name and Surname, they amerciate the absents in such summs and Fines as they please, & for the most part, far exceeding the pains contained in the Act of Parliament; whereupon the Souldiours are im∣mediatly warranted to go and exact the same by quar∣tering. Which Practice is not more unjust in it's illegal and summar procedor, then rigid and exorbitant; both as to the quantity and the maner of exacting it, by rea∣son of their riding and quartering - money (which is therewith exacted) and the other inconveniences which inseparably attend the rapine and violence of profane souldiours. 3. In many places, not contented thus to Fine and Exact, the souldiours, on the Lords day, go to
private houses, and by plain force compel and drive to the Church all such as they find, and oftentimes do insolently beat and abuse persons who by reason of in∣firmity or sickness are really unable: A practise so cru∣el and absurd, that some of themselves have said, it was our Lord's way to drive buyers and sellers out of the Temple, but not to drive them into it. 4. As to the exacting and levying of the Parliaments Fines, the same was done (by a reference of the Councill to the Com∣missioner, and his orders thereon) in such an oppres∣sive and exorbitant manner as cannot be paralelled. For 1. Parties of horse being directed to several Shires, when a party arrived in any Shire, they direct their order to all the persons therein Fined, intimating to them and every one of them to pay their respective Fines, with three shillings sterling per diem for every horse-man in the party, from the day and date of their Order until the Fine be payed, and the payment signi∣fied to the commander of the Party: By which extor∣tions, many have been compelled to pay more for Quartering then the summe and quantity of their Fine; and during the time of these oppressions, many have computed that the Sherifdoms of Air & Refrew, were compelled to pay upon the accompt of Quarterings, over and above the Fines, betwixt two and three thou∣sand merks Scots per diem. 2. There was no defence nor exemption allowed against these Quarterings; for whether the person fined did liberat himself by taking the Declaration, or that it was alleaged that he was Mi∣nor, or an Infant, or never Charged, or that his Pre∣decessor charged was since Deceased, or that his pre∣decessor was never Charged, yea Died before he was fined, or that the person quartered on was only Relict of the person fined (a poor Widow living upon a mean
Joincture) or that the person quartered on had no Re∣lation to the person fined, save that he lived in the house and place which once pertained to him, and which this person lawfully Purchased, even before the other was fined; Yet all was repelled, and no complaint of this rigor and violence could be heard or receaved; but on the contrary the complainer (especially if he re∣fused to take the Declaration) was rejected with most insolent reproaches and menaces. 3. That both in the up-lifting of the Fine and exacting of the Qwarter∣ings, the extremity of rigor was used, by dragging some to prison, who either were known altogether indigent and insolvent, or did offer to renounce the Benefit of the Act of Indemnity (the forfaulture where∣of was the alternative and utmost certification for not payment of the Fine, contained in the Act of Fin∣ing) or by Plundering, Beating, and Spoiling others without possibility of redress. We need not adduce Particular Instances for the verification of these things, seing they were not done in a corner: But the cry of this violence as it filled the whole Land; so no doubt it also reached unto the very Heavens, and is entered in to the ears of Him who hateth violence and loveth righteousness, who saith unto Princes, remove vio∣lence and spoil, and execute judgement and justice, take away your exactions from my people. One thing mainly to be considered is, that as Prelacy is the great cause of all the Sin and Misery that afflicteth us; so was it by the instigation of the same wicked Apostats, that these Fines so long delayed were thus at length rigo∣rously exacted: And that for no other purpose, then the leavying of moe Forces for their security and support, and the better strengthening of their Tyranny. Cer∣tainly were it not of the Lord, who, because of our
contempt of his glorious Gospel, and blessed Mini∣stry, hath plagued us with stupidity, and smitten us with madness, blindness and astonishment of heart, to give unto us the reward of our own hands, and to cause us to eat the fruit of our doings, it were impos∣sible that rational men after the feeling of so sore griev∣ances, and the teaching of so many and sad experienc∣es, should still couch under the burthen and submitt themselves to the yoke of a few insignificant Apostate Upstarts, and not rather acquit themselves like men, by pulling off these vizards of Religion, under which they mask their villanies, and plucking them out of that Sanctuary and great refuge of Loyalty, which they do not more pretend then profane by all their hor∣rid Rebellion against God, and their cruell Persecu∣tions of His faithfull Servants and the Kings true Sub∣jects, which they palliat under this pretext; to the effect that in the righteous and deserved Punishment of these wicked men, both the sin and Backsliding of the Land might be sisted, and the fierce anger of the Lord averted. This is the wickedness and violence of accursed Pre∣lacy, which though it hath diffused it self over the whole Land, and left no corner thereof untouched, yet as the West hath been more grievously thereby op∣pressed and afflicted, so poor Galloway in a manner hath been the point in which all it's malice and Tyranny hath been concentred. We need not here search after Par∣ticulars, or be curious for the verification thereof; the cries and groans of that afflicted Countrey have filled all mens ears, and the desolations thereof are obvious to every ones eyes: Nor need we insist to purge their innocency or clear the causes of their sufferings, which were no other then their adherence to their faithfull
Ministers (though casten out and rejected by men, yet continuing through the grace of God, to preach amongst them) and their detestation of a crue of un∣worthy Curates (scatterers and devourers, not Pa∣stors of the flock) thrust in amongst them more vio∣lently then upon any other part of the Countrey. The thing we have here to observe is, that the manner of their persecution was first and last by plain Hostile In∣vasion. After which maner Sir Iames Turner with his Forces (having twice before been amongst them) in March 1666, with greater power and fury then ever formerly, marcheth against them: where being arrived, what exactions, oppressions and insolencies, he and his forces committed by arbitrary fining, plundering, quartering, imprisoning, beating, wounding, bind∣ing men like beasts, chasing to moors and mountains, and by harassing and laying both Parishes and Coun∣trey-sides almost wholly desolate; the ruine and beg∣gery of several hundreds of families, and the impove∣verishing and great distress of many others do abun∣dantly testify: And yet after all these atrocious inju∣ries, by the contrivance and authority of the Bishop of Galloway, (who sometimes appeared so zealous for the Covenant and Work of God, that, frequently in his ad∣ministration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to the People of his own Parish, while he was a private Minister, when they were sett at Table and ready to Participate, he caused them to renew the Oath of the Covenant, subjoining thereto both that solemnity and these words used by Nehemia, Chap. 5.13. when in the like case he did shake his lap, and said, so God shake out every man from his house and from his labor, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shak∣en
out and emptied) by the prescription, we say, of the same Bishop and his Synod, these poor oppressed people, after all these exactions, are urged and com∣pelled to subscribe an acknowledgement that Sir Iames had used them civilly and discreetly; whereby they were forced not only to deny common sense, and lay aside their just resentments, but by this their Sub∣scription (which might be opposed to all their com∣plaints) they were virtually excluded from all hope of redress. All which things are not only confirmed by the notoriety of the matter of fact, but are also by that grievous and mournfull Paper of their sufferings, most amply cleared and instructed. To which though Sir Iames hath made an answer for his own vindica∣tion, yet seeing the same doth for the most part re∣solve in a simple denyall (which it was easy for him to make, having neither accuser nor contradicter) and he at most giveth only an account of, & vindicateth his orders, without so much as denying the excess, that might have ensued in that military way of execution, (expressly waving to answer the extortions of these par∣ties, which were commissionated for civill Fines) any further reply were superfluous. This poor people having continued and lyen under all these miseries, for the space of seven moneths and upward after Sir Iames his third Invasion, and thereby witnessed not only their very firm & Christian Patience towards God; but also given a greater testimony of their loyally and submission to the King's commands, then all the flattering and flaunting professions of these their adversaries (who rather then to suffer the hun∣dred part of these hardships, would curse both God and their King) will amount to: And knowing by sad
experience, that both Separat Petitioning had been by Sir Iames insolently rejected, & that Joint Petitioning was by Act of Parliament condemned, and conse∣quently all hope this way being cut off, upon an very Accidental & Indeliberat Occasion, they were stirred up and gave the rise to the actions and commotions following; which was thus. Sir Iames still breathing forth persecutions, upon the 13 of November last, ordereth four souldiours, from Dumfreis to the Parish of Dalray in Galloway, to poind a poor old man's goods; and in case they should find none, to seise and apprehend his person, and bring him prisoner to Dumfries. The souldiours in prosecution of this order, apprehending the old innocent man, bind him hand and foot like a beast, and lay him bound upon the ground, ready to be carried along. When two or three of his neighbours, commoyed with so great an indignity, come and desire the souldiours to loose him, they, in stead of satisfying their desire, sudden∣ly assault the Countrey-men with their swords drawn, and necessitat them to their own defence: Whereupon one of the souldiours being wounded, the other three throw down their Arms, and the poor man is relieved, The Countreymen, having thus accquited themselves against these first aggressors, in prosecution of their own necessary defence, against the violence of 10 or 12 more souldiours, who were oppressing in the same Parish, (whom now they had greater cause to fear then be¦fore) upon the morrow thereafter, with the assist∣ance of 6 or 7 whom they joined to themselves, they quietly seise upon and secure them, all of them render∣ing their Arms, except one who was killed in his re∣sistance. After this, the Countrey being a little hereby alarmed, but most of all determined by their
former sad experience, that Sir James would certain∣ly avenge himself of this affront, upon the whole Countrey without distinction of free and unfree, and that in fury and rage, as far exceeding his former per∣secutions, as the cause was different, they gather to the number 54 Horsemen with some few Footmen, and instantly resolving upon it, they march towards Dumfreis; where upon the 15 of November they take Sir James prisoner, and disarm the Souldiours that were with him without harm or violence to any, ex∣cept the wounding of one man who made more ob∣stinate resistance. Being thus by the over-ruling hand of Divine Providence, and the force of irresistible necessity, more then by any human contrivance, en∣gaged in a business of this importance beyond all hope of retreat; and considering how many in the West and els-where, did groan under the yoke of this wicked Prelacy, and did suffer by their Tyranny, whom the just apprehension of that rigour and cruelty, to which the report of what had hapned would enrage the adver∣saries against all without distinction, might persuade yea necessitat to a conjunction, they from Dumfreis move towards the West. In the mean time, the re∣port being brought to the Council, the Arch-bishop Pre∣siding and over-ruling in it, Lieut. General Dalzel is immediatly ordered to march with all the Forces to∣ward Glasgow; which accordingly was done, with more hast, rage and fury, then if 10000 Infidels had with fire and sword invaded the Land: And a Procla∣mation is emitted against the Rebels (as they called them) risen in Arms in Galloway, Air, and other Pla∣ces of the West, (when as at this time there were not 40 Men in the Sherifdom of Air, who had joyned with
them) declaring this Insurrection to be manifest and horrid Rebellion, and therefore charging the persons accessary, to lay down Arms within 24 hours after pu∣blication, without any assurance of Indemnity offered, and lastly, commanding the whole Subjects to be assist∣ing to the Lieutenant General, and being requir∣ed by him or others in Authority, to rise in Arms, and assist with all their Power, under the Pain of Re∣bellion. A Proclamation so full of fury and madness, not only rendering such as were in Arms desperate without hope, except in the cruel mercy of the wick∣ed Prelates; But also engaging all without distinction, either Actively to concur to the destroying of these poor, innocent and afflicted People, or els to prepare themselves for suffering the same pains and punish∣ment, that it may justly be wondered at, that even the single motive of this Proclamation, did not procure, to these Galloway-men, a greater concourse. But that poor hand-full being come towards the West, and some hundreds there, (whom partly the like pressures and fears of worse, but most of all, the sense and re∣membrance of the indispensible obligation of the Holy Covenant, for mutual sympathy and defence, and our uttermost endeavours all the dayes of our lives to prosecute the great and blessed Ends therof, did there∣to determine) having, in the sincerity and simplicity of their hearts, joined themselves to that company, most harmlesly and inoffensively, without the least vio∣lence or exaction done to any, they march through the Countrey until they come to Lanerk. Where, upon the consideration of the Lord's wrath, imminent upon the whole Land by reason of breach of Covenant,
and the many horrid Sins thereon ensuing, and the ap∣prehension of His holy displeasure yet continuing, (whereof, by many visible and afflicting signs and tok∣ens, they were most sadly convinced) as men reduc∣ed to the last extremity and in great distress (after the example of Nehemiah and the Iewes, Neh. chap. 9, & 10. in the like case) they resolve and do renew the Solemn League and Covenant: That (at least) by this Action they might bear Testimony both to the oppressed Cause and Truth of God and their own in∣nocency. From Lanerk upon the 26 of November they march to Bathgae, and the morrow thereafter to Colington, a place about two miles distant from Edin∣burgh. That same night Lieut. Gen. Dalzel coming to Calder, there is a Cessation agreed to betwixt them for that night, and until, upon the morrow, their grievances and Petition might be presented to the Council; which they for that effect send to Dal∣zel to be by him transmitted. But as, notwith∣standing of this Cessation, (and though the same was timously signified to the Bishop as President of the Coun∣cil, yet) the Countrey-troops leavyed about Edin∣burgh, were not restrained from making an in-fall upon their Quarters, where they rested securely upon the trust of the Cessation; so upon the morrow, be∣fore almost they were aware, and without giving up the Cessation agreed to, Dalzel finding a nearer way doth almost surprize them: Whereupon they endea∣vour to march off, but finding the Enemy so near, they are constrained to stand to & prepare for that Con∣flict upon the South of Pentland-hils: Wherein the Lient General's forces and theirs being engaged, the very time and hour that the Gentle-man sent by Dalzel to the Council, was presenting his letters and the
West-land mens Grievances, these poor men not ex∣ceeding eight or nine hundreds, and extremly weak∣ened and spent by sore travail and watching, and mostly by their fasting and great abstinence, are (ac∣cording to the Holy, Wise and determinate Counsel of God) a litle after sun-set routed and dissipated. The number of the slain on both sides were reckoned, about 40 and upwards of the Westland men, and 4 or 5 of the Generals Forces. The number of the prison∣ers was greater, amounting in all to 130 and up∣ward: But, because the threed of this story hath precipitated our Narration to this fatal period, the observations following will supply what is om∣mitted. 1. That these men who rose in the West, were not only (for the most part) persons of known and very exemplar integrity, piety and zeal for God▪ and all of them (severally and jointly) so far from base and turbulent designes, that they cannot be supponed by any who know them, to have been Am∣bitious of either Rule or Riches▪ but also did with the same straightness and sincerity, in all parts declare, that their only Motives were the rigor of extreme Ne∣cessity, which constrained them to the defence of Religion and Liberty, and the Conscience of that in∣dispensible duty, vve all owe to God & one to another, in the bond of the Holy Covenant; and in the inno∣cency of a most harmless deportment, did fully con∣form themselves to these professions: so that it may truly be affirmed, that a company of more sin∣cere, upright and harmless men, did never in any age appear in such a posture. Which as it doth emi∣nently appear, in their sparing and civil usage of Sir Iames Turner, and their great abstinence and
moderation in all places, not only from Plunder and such insolencies, but even from the necessary means of Subsistence; so it is a truth so certain, that all their ene∣mies (save a few profane Curates, who spare no lies whereby they may vent their malice) must and do ac∣knowledge it. 2. That as in many places, there were many found who joined themselves to the Lieut. General's Forces, to assist against and suppress that faithfull afflicted company; so the Militia of Edinburgh (by order from the Secret Council to the Town-Council, and from the Town-Council to the several Captains, who did admi∣nistrate it to their respective Companies) did, in oppo∣sition to the same persons, take the following Oath, viz. I shal be true and faithfull to the King, and shall de∣fend his Authority and maintain the same, against this Insurrection and Rebellion, and any other that shall happen, with the hazard of my life and fortune; And the two Shires of Middle and East Lauthians did arm very readily against them: But whether this Insur∣rection was in Rebellion against the King, or whether this Conjuration and these Practices, were not a mani∣fest Conspiracy and horrid Rebellion against the great God, a few reflections on what we have premised shall hereafter clear. 3. That as only the force of Necessity, from the rigor of their persecutions, and the cutting off of all liberty to Petition or hope of Redress, did compel the West-land men to this course; so upon the first appear∣ance and most slender insinuation of liberty to Repre∣sent Grievances to these in Authority, they very wil∣ingly and readily embraced the opportunity, and signi∣fied
to the Council, that the only evill under which the Land perisheth, is the Erecting of this wicked and ty∣rannous Prelacy contrary to the Holy Covenant, and the cruel oppression, both in Body & Conscience of all that desire to continue Faithfull therein: but how they were abused in this offer and Transaction, we have before related. 4. That though the wicked Prelats (for the greater exaltation of their pride and triumph, both over God and his Cause) have boldly affirmed, that these men were by certain Faithfull Ministers persuaded and brought out, in the full assurance of most certain Victo∣ry, and that their Cause was such, that upon the Event they could venture their salvation; yet the contrary is most certainly known, & that they came out, for the most part, most voluntarly and of their own accord; thinking it their duty (as one of them in his Testi∣mony doth declare) to appear for and help the Lord against the mighty: And that, though they had and still retain a most firm persuasion of the justice of the Lord's Cause and Covenant, and a very confident assurance that the Lord will arise and own it, to the utter confu∣sion of His adversaries; Yet, knowing that Times and Seasons are in the Lord's hand, and that the time hath already been, when such who had indignation, and whose heart was against the holy Covenant did prosper, and by Arms pollute the Sanctuary of strength, and place the Abomination that maketh desolate, wherein, though the people that did know their God were strong and did exploits, yet did they fall by the sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by spoil many dayes; These men did neither limit the Holy One, nor bal∣lance
their resolution upon the assurance of future Events: Yea the fear and apprehension of these many visible signs attending this Action, whereby the Lord's standing controversie and continuing displeasure a∣gainst the Land, for fearfull breach of Covenant, and the many horrible sins that have ensued (which then more then ever were discovered, both in the actuall opposition of many, and faint withdrawing of others, of whom better things were looked for) did justly make them conceave, that as the Lord, who hath ever glorified His own Name, would also now glori∣fy it, both in their active and passive Testimony (a seal which His Work and Cause, hath not hitherto so visibly had) And that they were rather thereto called, then to be the Lands Deliverers; for which, all that fear the Lord may think with trembling, greater judg∣ments are yet ordained. 5. That amongst the many observable providences of God, whereby he brought this Action to it's pe∣riod, their turning from Lanerk towards Edinburgh, and leaving the West, specially these parts where many faithful men were preparing for a Conjunction, doth bear the very eminent characters of the Lord's Work and Purpose, which he hath since made manifest; and was the occasion of the proscribing of several both Ministers and Gentlemen, as we shall hereafter men∣tion. 6. That as the Louthian-men were very active in appearing against this faithfull company; so after the Conflict, they were very vigilant and inhumane to take and spoil all such flyers as they rencountred: A sin which no doubt, by reason of it's greater aggrava∣tions, the Lord will require with greater severity,
then that of Edom, Obad. 12. &c. who rejoyced over the children of Iudah in the day of their destruction; and laid hands on their substance in the day of their cala∣mity, who stood in the cross way to cut off such as did escape, and delivered up these that did remain in the day of distress; and therefore he is threatened by the Lord, that for his violence against his brother, shame should cover him, and he should be cut off for ever. Thus we have seen the indignation of the Lord; in the most dreadful and astonishing of all judgements, even his suffering and causing the righteous to fall be∣fore the wicked, in delivering the soul of his turtle dove unto the multitude of the wicked; His Name unto reproach and blasphemy, His Strength into cap∣tivity, and His Glory into the enemies hands: A providence that may justly move our astonishment to a greater height then that of Iosuah chap 7. v. 9. Oh Lord, what wilt thou do unto thy great Name? And how terrible are the charge and succeeding Judge∣ments which these things do denounce? But the Lord who in wrath remembers mercy, maketh both judge∣ment and mercy his peoples song; and it is to his enemies alone, that a cup without mixture is poured out; as the things which follow will declare. The Arcbishop of St. Andrews having caused celebrat the report of this Victory, with almost as many Guns from the Castle as there were men slain in the fields, and as if the 40 had been 40000 Infidels, the prisoners are brought in, and secured. We cannot but here mention the ready and charitable relief, which many good people in Edinburgh did then extend to them;
certainly it is gone up for a Memorial before God, and shall have a return. But who can express the malice of that Antichristian spirit, raging both in the Arch-Prelate and his dependents, which misery it self doth not satiate; and therefore they do so exclaim against this poor expression of humanity, as preposterous and savouring of disaffection, that even some of their own Complices did condemn them for it. The Councill falling immediately to the examination of the Prisoners, they remitt first 10, thereafter 14 to the Iustices to be arraigned or rather condemned as Traitors, they having first determined and prescribed the very maner of their execution: and about the same time the Commissioner going West, with some others impowered for that effect, do likewise at Air and Glasgow condemn other sixteen. These things we join together, because both their Indictments, maner of Tryall, Doom and Execution were the same, except in so far as shall be noted. The Indictment and Charge of Treason exhibited against all, consisted of two heads and crimes, deduced from old and late Acts of Parlia∣ment, and aggravated by many circumstances, viz. rising and gathering in Arms, and renewing the Cove∣nant without and against the Kings Authority and con∣sent: Every one's particular accession was libelled from, and proven by his own confession before the Council. This place might require a large digression for answering the crimes objected, and clearing the innocency of the Lord's Witnesses; but seing the pre∣ceeding Narration doth not only furnish all arguments thereto requisite, but warranteth them by Prece∣dents beyond contradiction, it shall suffice now to ob∣serve.
1. That God the Fountain of all Power, and Author of all Right, as, wherever he hath granted to any creature a Being, he hath also armed it with a love and power of Self-preservation sutable to it's capacity; so much more, where, unto a Being, He hath super∣added a Right, as in all rationall creatures, which cannot be violated but both by Force and Injury, hath He granted both the Power and Right of Self-defence, which is really one and the same thing with it, and in effect nothing else but that divine Impress and rational Instinct, whereby the very course of Nature is uphol∣den, so inseparable from the Being and Right of the creature, that it never ceaseth, except where by the Soveraign Will and Law of God, the Right is first annulled and the Being may be destroyed. Which position, being the clear and true foundation of all Rule and Righteousness, and even of the Being of all things, it may justly be wondered, that men should be found, who deny and would subvert it in it's first, principall and most immediate effects. But if accord∣ing hereunto any will subsume and prove, that either by the Lord's ordaining of powers, or mens Surren∣dar and Submission thereto, (made mainly for Self-preservation,) the foresaid Right and Power was or could be revoked or renounced, we shall most willing∣ly quite the plea, and prostitute our selves to all the violences that Tyranny can invent, since in that case there could be no Injury. 2. That as all Societies, Governments and Lawes are appointed in a due Subordination to God and His superior Will and Law, for His Glory and the Com∣mon Good of the People, including the safety of every individual; so, if either this Subordination be noto∣riously infringed, or these Ends intollerably pervert∣ed,
the common tie of both Society, Government and Law, is in so far dissolved. Hence is it that a King or Rulers commanding things directly contrary to the Law of God, may be and have been justly disobeyed, and by fury or folly destroying or alienating the King∣dome, may be and have been lawfully resisted. These are conclusions which our greatest Adversaries cannot but admit, and are not deducible from any other premisses. Let us hear King Iames, whose loyalty none can doubt, in a speech to the Parliament in the year 1609. he saith, a King degenerateth into a Tyrant when he leaveth to rule by Law, much more when he beginneth to invade his Subjects persons, rights and liberties, to set up an arbitrary power, impose unlaw∣ful Taxes, raise forces, make war upon his Subjects, to pillage, plunder, wast and spoil his Kingdomes. And lest his inconsequence be suspected, as if notwith∣standing all this, he would have a Tyrant incontro∣lable, it is upon the same grounds, that in his answer to Cardinal Perron, he justifyeth the Protestants in France their Defensive Arms; Now how a discretive judge∣ment in these cases, both of unrighteous commands, and wicked violence, and specially in the later, which is (by far) the more sensible, doth necessarily remain with the People, and in what maner the same is to be determined and cautioned, so as neither to li∣cense disobedience against Authority, nor create sedi∣tion in the Common-wealth, is already fully clear∣ed. 3. That though all Soveraign Powers, (upon the supposition of these true and great ends, and the pre∣sumption of reason and charity, that the persons in∣trusted do in like manner really intend them,) be con∣stituted
indefinitly and therefore in appearance univer∣sally without restriction; yet according to this known rule, that such particulars, as if expressed, would not (far more if they cannot) be consented to, are not understood to be comprised under a generall con∣descendence, such exceptions and limitations as are in∣dispensibly implyed and could not lawfully be expresly renounced, do stand in full force. Whereupon also both the Righteousness of God's judgements, and the Lawfullness of the Peoples Resistance against mal-versing Powers, are clearly and certainly founded. 4. That not only the light of Nature and undenya∣ble Reason together with the agreeable Practice of all Nations, specially of our Ancestors, do evidently clear these Principles proposed, but also our own ex∣press Statutes declaring the reveal'd Word and Will of God to be the Superior Rule and Law, and repeal∣ing all Acts repugnant thereto. Iac. 6. Par. 1. chap. 3, 4, & 8. and explaining such Acts as were generally made against unlawful Convocations and Leagues and Bonds among Subjects, to be understood with this due Sub∣ordination and limitation Car. 1. Par. 1. c. 29. together with the King and Peoples Oaths of faithful Admini∣stration and Alleadgeance: whereby the Coronation-Covenant and Contract, specially that made with this King (the very bond of the Kingdom) is established and secured, do undoubtedly infer, beyond all con∣tradiction, that both our Government and Lawes are constituted and to be interpreted with subordination to the Law and Will of God, and in order to these great Ends of their establishment. 5. That though prevailing Factions have in all times endeavoured, by their most excessive and boundless flatteries, to exalt and extend the Powers to an equal
degree of absoluteness in all Causes and over all Per∣sons, meerly for their own base ends and private ad∣vantages; yet if any of these persons would seriously consider, and would ingenuously declare their opinion, in a particular application of the case to themselves, what they would account lawfull for them to do either jointly or separately, in case that they were injuriously and violently invaded to the destruction of their Lives or Fortunes, or the subversion of their Families and dearest and nearest Concernments, their resolution in this point would easily justify the practises of all such, who, esteeming the Glory of God and the mainte∣nance of His Gospel infinitely preferable to all other Interests whatsoever, do valiantly offer and expose themselves for the vindication thereof, to the greatest hazards. 6. That through the manifest and notorious Per∣version of the great Ends of Society and Government, the Bond thereof being dissolved, the persons, one or moe thus liberated therefrom, do relapse into their primeve Liberty and Priviledge, and accordingly as the similitude of their case and exigence of their cause doth require, may upon the very same principles again join and associate for their better Defence & Preserva∣tion, as they did at first enter into Societies. 7. That we being a Nation so solemnly and expresly engaged by Covenant unto God, & one with another, for the advancing and promoving of these holy and important Ends therein contained, there lyeth upon all and every one of us an indispensible duty, by all possible means to promove the same, not only in our own conscientious and exemplary walking, and serious admonition and exhortation towards others; but also in endeavouring (in case of Defection) a National
Reformation, and valiant vindication of the Glory of God, and His Work and Cause, against all incorrigi∣ble Apostates; as we would not not by conniving at their sin be partakers of their Judgement, and as we would by destroying the accursed from amongst us, avert the imminent wrath of God from the whole Land and Nation. Which position as we clearly before asser∣ted, both from the Profession and Practise of our first Reformers; so, that qualification in the Covenant, of our endeavours in our places and callings, is most agreeable thereto: seeing the same doth plainly import, that as every one is to confine himself to his own place and move in his own sphere, while all in their respective capacities do harmoniously concurre in the same work and duty; so if any in higher place and imployment, do not only become remiss and forgetful of the Oath of God; but, according to the extent and influence of their power, would seduce and corrupt their inferiors unto their Apostasy, it is both their place to resist such wickedness and violence, and their calling to endea∣vour either the Reformation or Removal of these who prove so contrary to, and obstructive of the ends whereunto they are ordained. Neither can this infe∣rence appear unwarranted or hard unto any who will impartially consider, that though the same qualifica∣tion doth in the like maner affect and define all duties whatsoever, which we owe either to God or our Countrey; yet it were most absurd thence to infer, that if these more eminently intrusted should either turn directly Apostates and enemies to the Christian Faith, or adversaries and destroyers of the Common-wealth, the people of an inferior degree might not step forward to occupy the places, and assert the In∣terests, which these wicked men had so traiterously
forfaulted and deserted. All which must necessarily be granted, if it be but rightly considered, that as Order and the Observance thereof, is only a mean sub∣ordinate to, and intended for the Glory of God and the good of the people; so must all the Regulation and Determination thereof be only admitted, in so far as it is Conducible, and no wayes to render it Destruct∣ive or Repugnant to these great Ends of its appoint∣ment. From all which we clearly conclude that thir words in the Covenant of Places and Callings, are no more Restrictive in the cases above mentioned, then a General's command to his souldiours entering in bat∣tel (being thus qualifyed) doth impede the necessity of Succession (in case of the vacancy of any charge, either through death or desertion) requisit for the obtaining of the proposed end of Victory; but that they are in effect (specially the antecedent and subjoined words sincerely, really and constantly, all the dayes of our life being considered) rather Exegetick and Ampliative. 8. That whatsoever Laws, Covenants and Engage∣ments were standing and binding unto us, before this late fearful Apostacy and Defection, they are still in the sight of God, and in the Consciences of all that fear His Name and mind his Glory, the rather more strong and obligeing then in the least infringed or dis∣solved: It being impossible that such Sacred Oaths (so solemnly sworn unto the most High) and such Righteous Laws by vertue thereof statuted and ena∣cted, for the carrying on, and establishment of the Work of God thereby intended, should be Ambula∣tory and Mutable at the pleasure of men; specially of such, who, without regard of God, Conscience, Honor or Honesty, have, in the very pride and power
of Wickedness, not only broken the Lords bands, casten away His cords, and violently (under the pre∣text of abused Authority) overturned his whole Work; but done despite against the same, both by ignomini∣ous Burning and Blaspheming of the Lords holy Cove∣nant. And this Position Rescissory we oppose unto their great Act Rescissory, and to all Acts and practices of the like nature antecedent thereto, or dependent thereupon. Being fully perswaded, that, though now they appear unequally ballanced, yet the Lord shall declare from heaven His Righteousness, and laugh at His enemies Acts and Devises, and have them all in derision. 9. That though we do heartily approve their  veneration and just esteem of lawfull Authority, (the great and excellent Ordinance of God) who to prevent all prejudice that it may incur, and inconvenience that may ensue thereon, do so far transmit this respect to the person therewith vested, as to hold for a Maxime (but indeed equally against Religion, Reason and Ex∣perience) that the King doeth no wrong; And though we are perswaded, that the true rise and cause of the sin and calamity under which we lye, is from the malice, perjury, flattery and violence of that Antichristian spirit ruling in the apostat Prelates; and therefore would willingly cloath our selves, even in the sight of man, with that ample Allowance and full Authority, whereby the King did once approve the holy Cove∣nant, and countenance the Lords Work, as if the same did yet stand (as it ought) not retracted or repeal'd. Yet seing our late Parliament by their second Act, Session se∣cond, have reprobated and discharged all pretences of Authority in this kind, notwithstanding that the same hath been and may be most necessary in many cases,
for the preserving of the Kingdom, & salving of State-inconveniences; we do therefore rather subsist on the former grounds, and turn our complaint and prayer unto God, who is the great King over all, looking for His appearance, and waiting for His salvation. 10. That the Glory of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Defence and Maintenance of the blessed Gospel, and it's precious Ministry and Ordinances, are Duties & Concernments infinitly more important, then the defence and preservation of our Lives, Liber∣ties and the Common-wealth, against the most barbar∣ous and horrid violences and injuries that can be ima∣gined: Like-as, the violation and destruction of all these is so evidently designed, and wickedly practi∣sed, by this late and present Apostacy, that a clearer ground and cause of Self-defence and Reformation cannot possibly be supposed; so that to condescend to answer the peevish clamours of these Neutral and careless men, who say, what needeth all this noise for the extrinsick and arbitrary forms of Government and modes of VVorship, both with and without which, Religion and Righteousness have equally flourished and prospered? where to shut our eyes from beholding the Glory and Grace of God, that in this Land hath so visibly appeared in, and been advanced by this great Ordinance of PRESBYTERY, by Himself (for that end) appointed; and also from the observing of these deludges of Profanity, Wickedness, Superstition and Violence, which the Devill, by his great engine of PRELACY, hath alwayes and in all Churches caused and procured. 11. That as such was the State, Condition and En∣gagements of this Church and Kingdom, at the time
of the King's return, and before the re-erecting of this Prelacy, that all and every one of the Nation were most strictly obliged sincerely, really and constantly to have resisted and opposed this wicked Defection to the last drop of their blood; so the sinfull complyance of many, and wofull fainting and withdrawing of others, might indeed incapacitat such as remain faithful from the best, but neither could nor can dis-engage them from their utmost endeavours. From these grounds and what hath been formerly represented, the argument of the Indictment of Trea∣son above-mentioned viz. That all Convocations and Risings in Arms, or Subjects entering in Leagues, with∣out or against the Kings Authority, are treasonable: But such was the late Rising and renewing of the Cove∣nant, Therefore &c. May be easily and clearly answe∣red, that all such Risings and entering into Leagues, as are not warranded and commanded by the Superior Law and Authority of God (who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords) which by our own express Acts and Statutes are acknowledged, and are not founded upon the Fundamental Right, and necessarily intended for the preservation of Religion and Righteousness, the great and principal End of all Laws and Governments, according whereunto our Laws have also by posterior Statutes been expresly interpreted, are indeed treaso∣nable: But such the late Rising was not; but on the contrary was more clearly approven by these grounds, then any other the like Instance which can be adduced or instructed, from the parallel of any other Age or Nation; Therefore it was altogether Lawful, Righte∣ous and Necessary. Which answer, though the Lords faithful Witnesses did sufficiently insinuat and pro∣pone,
yet both the Constitution of the Court, and persons of the Judges before whom they were arraign∣ed, were such, as the same was rather accounted an aggravation of their Crime and Treason. But seeing this was not done, without the specious pretexts, not only of iniquous Laws, but also of Re∣ligion and Scripture; We shall briefly consider, first, that Queree often made to them, where they had read or how they could instruct, that, under the Pretence of Religion, it is lawful for Subjects to rise in Rebellion against lawfull Authority? To which it is answered, that this Queree is a clear begging of the question, by expresly supposing that the late Rising was only in pre∣tence for Religion, but really in Rebellion, which ought first to have been proved, and is in effect an arrant ca∣lumny and falshood. 2. That even the Queree it self seems to imply and grant, that for Subjects to rise in Arms really for the defence of Religion, against the in∣vasions of the Powers under the pretence of Lawful Authority, is both lawful and laudable: Which being the true case and cause of this late Rising, and so clearly warranted both by the Word and Covenant of God, and the practise of all Reformed Churches; we are con∣tent to refer these poor mens Innocency, unto the Con∣sciences and secret thoughts of their adversaries. Secondly, we shall consider these texts of Scrip∣ture which were pretended against the Innocents: and 1. it was much urged that Rebellion is as the sin of witch-craft; To which one of themselves did roundly and clearly answer, that, the place having been spoken by the Prophet to a King, because of his disobedience and contempt of the command of God, and not to Subjects, would sooner conclude his Accusers then
himself to be a Rebell. Secondly, it answered, that Rising up against Authority it self, the Ordinance of God, and disobeying the Powers therewith vested, standing and acting in their right line of Subordination, is indeed Rebellion, and as the sin of witchcraft; but to resist and rise up against persons Abusing sacred Autho∣rity and rebelling against God the Supream, is rather to adhere to God as our Liege Lord, and to vindicate both our selves and his abused Ordinance, from man's wickedness and Tyranny. The second text objected was that, Math. 26.52. where even our Lord himself, when violently seised upon by wicked men, but who were then in Authority; did nevertheless restrain his disciples from his own de∣fence and rescue, saying unto Peter, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword, shal perish with the sword; To which, as it was sufficiently answered (without any reply) by one of these Impea∣ched, (whom they accounted distracted, though with∣out the least appearance of impertinency) who thereto did oppone Luke 22.36. Where our Lord, speaking at the same time and to the same purpose, saith, he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one; Yet for further clearing, we say, 1. That from the place it self in all the Evangelists, it is most evident, that that command was given, and these words spoken by our Lord, only for to testify his voluntar submission unto the Fathers will, by laying down of his life for fulfil∣ling of the Scripture, as is clear from the same 26. of Matth. v. 54. & Iohn. 18.11. otherwise the context being considered (that not only in Luke 22.36. cited, He, fore∣warning his disciples of hazards to come, adviseth them to provide swords and weapons; and in the 26 of Matt., asserts his power to have called 12 legions of Angels
to his assistance, which clearly implyes the lawfulness thereof) this Scripture objected doth more confirm then impugn the Lawfulness of Defensive Arms. 2. Is it possible that men should be so much demented by flattery, as to think that it was unlawful for Jesus Christ the Mighty God and Lord over all, to have de∣fended himself by the assistance of his Disciples, against the horrid Wickedness and Insurrection of the vilest of His creatures, had it not been, that it was necessary that the Scriptures concerning him should be accomplished. 3. Where our Lord saith in the place objected, all they that take the sword, shal perish with the sword, as He thereby only condemneth Un∣just and Offensive war; so the Saying it self, by its later part, doth tacitely imply the Lawfulness and Justice of both Defensive and Vindictive Arms, the same being otherwise justly founded. Though these Texts were only objected, yet to help our Adversaries, who are known not to be much conversant in the Scripture, and to obviate the scru∣ples that may thence arise to others, we subjoyn a third text Iohn. 18.36. where our Lord saith, if my King∣dom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Iews, whence some infer, that all Arms, even in Defence of Reli∣gion, are unlawfull and prohibited; But it is answer∣ed, as the intent and scope of our Lord's answer, was to clear himself of that calumny objected against Him by the Iews, that he made Himself a King in opposi∣tion to Caesar; so the meaning of it is plain and obvious, to wit, that our Lord's Kingdom is not of the Nature and for the Ends, for which other Kingdoms of this world were instituted; but wholly spiritual for declar∣ing
the Truth, and thereby gaining souls unto glory: Whence as our Lord would there infer that he came not to conquer to himself Disciples by outward force, and thereby to gain followers by the spoiling of Caesar and other Princes; so it is without all shaddow of con∣nexion thence to conclude, that a people having recea∣ved the blessing of the Gospel and Kingdom of Iesus Christ, should without Resistance suffer themselves (to the manifest dishonor of God and the hazard of the eternal damnation of themselves and their posteri∣ty) to be impiously and sacriledgiously spoiled and deprived thereof, when they are in a capacity to de∣fend the same. The truth whereof, together with the hypocrisy of our Adversaries, may soon be discover∣ed, if the Question be but stated in the terms of one For∣raign & independent Prince's invading another, meerly upon the account of the Christian Faith; and whatever solution or evasion they shall herein make, will as exactly quadrat to the case in hand, it being almost ridiculous to conceave, that the greatest aggravation of Invasions of this Kind, to wit, that it is made by a Prince upon his own Subjects (whose Profession he himself is principally bound to maintain) should im∣port any speciality and difference in the cases. The last text is that of Math. 5.39. and remanent verses to the end, where our Lord saith, resist not evill, but who∣soever shall smite thee &c. with the other parallel places, specially Rev. 13.10.. But it is answered, that as these places do injoyn either patience, when the clear call and dispensations of God do inevitably call unto suffer∣ing, without which patience were no patience but rather stupidity; or that bounty and debonairity which our Lord would have his disciples to practise, in the remitting and dispensing with the utmost extensions
and points of Right, for the better reproving and con∣demning of the animosities and rigid contentions of men, for matters of small or no moment, and the more effectuall commending the grace and peace of the Gospel; So thence to infer that men should give way to all Violence and Sacriledge (to the subverting of Religion and Righteousness) is, after the manner of Sathan, to cheat and abuse men by the holy Scrip∣tures of Truth unto wickedness and error; and grossly to exceed that signal rule mainly in these places intend∣ed, to wit, that we should be perfect even as our Fa∣ther which is in heaven is perfect, who, though he filleth the earth with his goodness, and extendeth his bounty unto all, causing the sun to rise upon the evill and on the good, yet doth he love righteousness, and helpeth and delivereth the oppressed; and command∣eth the zeal of his own glory (wherein He himself doth often eminently appear) by the hand of His people, to take vengeance on His adversaries. Let us therefore in the consideration of what is said Rev. 13.10. he that leadeth into captivity, shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword, must be killed with the sword, both possess our souls in patience under all the former sufferings, and hope and rejoice in the faith of the succeeding delivery there subjoyned. These are the Defences which these Faithful men did summarily hint at, and being often interrupted, were scarcely permitted to propone: All which being reject∣ed as unworthy to be heard, what wonder, if what their Advocats did plead in their defence, upon the point of Quarter given, to some of them in the field, was also repelled? We are not to dip in matters of this kind; but certainly it much discovereth the spirit
of malice and violence that now prevaileth, that neither the Nature and Import of Quarter, which per∣taineth nothing to Grace or Pardon (whereof these men were declared incapable) but is a paction of the Law of Nations, whereby the person worsted, by quitting of his arms, (the only and oftentimes the probable means either of his safety or vengeance) doth condition for, and redeem his immunity as to life; Nor yet the honor of the Granters, Persons Commissio∣nated by the King for the command of his Forces, with the common Priviledges and dignities belonging to such Offices; Nor yet the Practice of all Nations about, even in the case of Intestine War; Nor the ra∣tional arguments of humanity and prudence, not to reduce men to utter despair in succeeding Insurrections (from which no Kingdom is priviledged) Nor lastly, the Paucity of these few innocents, not exceeding 5 or 6 who could have been thereby benefited (there being many other taken and not upon Quarter) could prevail against that Pedantick distinction inter bellum justum & injustum. But this being alleadged to have been bellum injustum, (as indeed it was in the justest sense) therefore no faith nor Quarter must be herein observed, quia, sc. adversus Hostes tantum est Bellum, at in Perduelles, judicium, as if from this, one should con∣clude, that though in War there may be faith and Quarter, yet in Iudgement there ought neither to be Truth nor Performance. All defences therefore being repelled, these persons accused were all condemned to be hanged to death as Traitors, and their Heads and right Hands to be cut off, to be disposed on by the Council, and their Goods and
Estates to be forfaulted to the Kings use. And accor∣dingly upon several dayes, this Sentence was executed upon thirty five of these faithful men, and by Ordi∣nance of Council, the heads of many of them were affixed upon the Ports of several Burghs; and the right hands of the first ten (to the high contempt of God and His holy Covenant, and to the provocation of His jea∣lousy) on the Tolbooth of Lanerk, where the Covenant was by them solemnly renewed and sworn. As for the other five, they were and are reprived; One of them, who in all his Tryall, to the conviction of all appear∣ed most constant in the Covenant, and bold and per∣tinent in his Testimony, upon the colour of a fit of distraction (by which he was once vexed) and through the intercession of many in his behalf; An other of them, for his vile and abject fainting to the very reproach of humanity, redeeming his life by becoming Hang-man to seven of his fellows, when two ordinary Execu∣tioners in the Burghs about had plainly refused, de∣claring they would have nothing to do with the blood of such Righteous men, and one of them therefore im∣prisoned; The other three, partly because of their fainting and condescendence to take the Declaration, and partly through the favour and intercession of friends. We shall not, nor cannot enter upon the particular declaration of that Grace, Constancy and Courage, by which the Lords faithful Witnesses were sustained, and did bear Testimony to the Word of his Truth, the holy Covenant, and the Cause and Work of God. Only this is certain, that the Lord did not more de∣sert that vile abject person to the weakness of flesh and blood, whereby he was depressed below the very con∣tempt of men, then by His Grace and Glory, evi∣dently
to manifest the power thereof, He was emi∣nently present with such as He honoured to be his Wit∣nesses, to cause them contemn and triumph over Prin∣cipalities and Powers, hell and death, and all their ter∣rours; as may be evident from these things follow∣ing. 1. That the Council, pitching upon those men with∣out choise, for a Test of discrimination did require several of them, by taking the Declaration, to renounce the Covenant; which they constantly refused. And so were Martyred, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. 2. That Mr Hew Mackaile, a young man of 25 years of age, and an Expectant in the Ministery, being ar∣raigned and accused through meer spite of the Arch-Bishop of St. Andrewes, (against whose Iudas-like Apo∣stacy he had preached four years ago) for no greater accession, then that he had been some few dayes with these that rose, with a sword (having been most un∣circumspectly taken, leaying them because of his in∣firmity and weakness the day before the Conflict) did not only most patiently endure cruel Torture whereby he was examined, for the discovery of the contrivance of that Rising, which all men knew and saw to be In∣deliberat; but, notwithstanding the promise of favour plainly made to him upon condition of ingenuity (which he sincerely used) being also condemned, did utterly reject all insinuations made unto him upon con∣dition of the least Retractation; and bitterly mourning for, and repenting of his apparent fainting and relin∣quishing, though; it really proceeded more from his infirmity, then fear or love of life, but rejoycing in his own folly, whereby the Lord did bring him to such a manifestation of his Grace, and declaration of His
Glory, he, to the admiration of all, in his most con∣stant and Christian suffering, by his blood sealed the Truth and glorified God. 3. That others of them, though obscure and illite∣rate men, upon the Scaffold hurried and interrupted in the declaring of their Testimony, by the Prelats Or∣ders, and the rudeness and inhumanity of these that executed them; yet did bear witness to the cause of God, and of that grace and assurance, whereby the Lord upheld them, to the admiration and astonishment of all the beholders. 4. That though at Glasgow and Air, where eleven of them were executed, (all mean Countrey-men, and some of them of decrepit age, and others of them very young, not exceeding 18 years) their enemies caused beat drums about the Scaffold that they might not be heard (a barbarity never practised in Scotland, and rarely heard of, except in the Duke of Alva's Martyr∣ing of the Protestants in the Low-countreyes) yet were they so litle thereby amazed, that both by words of of Praise and thanksgiving to God, that had honoured such plough-men (as they termed themselves) to be His witnesses, and the constancy of their countenance and whole carriage, they did bear such testimony to the Holy Covenant, as both many were thereby con∣firmed, and their Enemies ashamed. 5. That though some of them did appear weak and faint-hearted at first, yet so powerfully and abundantly was it given to them in that hour, that out of weakness they were made strong; and declared that they had seen such glimpses of the Glory of God betwixt the prison and the Scaffold, that all fear was clearly discussed; And particularly a young Countrey-boy, not much above sixteen years of age, being condemned at Aix,
mostly because he did refuse to take the Declaration, which they told him, was the renouncing of that Co∣venant which he had taken at Lanerk; & though, both through fear and ignorance of the very grounds of Christianity, he fell into great anxiety, neither daring to die, nor yet to redeem his life at the rate proposed; Yet after the Prayers and Conference of some that had access to him at Irwin two dayes before his death, on the morning that he suffered, he appeared so much changed, both from the depth of fear and perplexity unto great resolution and joy, and so much enlightened with the knowledge of God in our Lord Jesus Christ, and the hope of Salvation through His Name, that all that saw him, do bear testimony to the Grace and wonderfull Work of God, & of that joy of heart, that carried him to the Scaffold, leaping and praising God. From all which particulars, and from the severall Testimonies and Speaches, which these left behind them in writing, we must conclude and rejoyce, that God out of the dark cloud of such a sad and astonishing providence which lately overspread us, hath brought forth so blessed and bright a cloud of Witnesses, strengthened and filled with so much grace and glory, to bear Testimony unto His Name, Covenant and Cause and for the confirmation of all that love and wait for His Salvation. We have hitherto ommitted, to say any thing to that Oath of Conjuration taken by the Militia of Edin∣burgh, and the concurrence and assistance of many others, who did either Actually rise in Arms for the suppressing of God's People and Cause, or since the Conflict did stop, apprehend, and spoil them in the cross way, and have been assisting and abetting to their deaths and persecutions, either as Guarders of Prisons,
Courts or Scaffolds, or as Iudges, Clerks, Advocats, Assizers, or Officers in the Dooms pronounced against them. If, after all the truth, equity and reason that have been represented, and the Power and Glory which God hath declared, men will not hear and fear, nor be converted, neither the tongues of men and Angels, nor of such as should return from the dead, would be of any force or persuasion to prevail with them. Is it possible, that Edinburgh should think that the pre∣tence of a new invented Oath of alleageance and fidelity to the King, and for the defence of his Authority against all Insurrections and Rebellions, wherein the Prelates and the Up hold of their wickedness, and the Subject∣ing of all the Godly to their lust and tyranny, were and are clearly intended and designed, shall warrand them in the great day of the Lord (who is terrible unto the Kings of the earth) for taking part with Rebels and Apostats against the God of heaven, and for oppos∣ing and oppressing of such, as, continuing stedfast in the common Cause and Covenant (for which Edinburgh was once very honourable and eminent) did only endea∣vour to liberat themselves from that intolerable Bon∣dage both of Bodies and Consciences (more grievous then death) under which they groaned? doth Edin∣burgh thus not only condemn the practice of Our Noble Ancestors and Reformers, who accounted it neither Insurrection nor Rebellion to set themselves for the defence of the Gospel against the then Powers, who did endeavour to oppress it; but by this Oath, aban∣don both Religion and Liberty, in this so perillous and backsliding a Generation, to the lust and tyranny of abused Authority, and whatsoever it shall please to impose, without control or contradiction? Do they thus remember the National Covenant and the Solemn
League and Covenant once so powerfully sworn and owned amongst them, and the mutuall defence and assistance, wherein every one of us is thereby bound to another, to the uttermost of our Power, against all sorts of persons whatsoever, and not to suffer our selves, by whatsoever Combination, Terror or Perswasion; to be divided and withdrawn from that blessed Vnion therein contained? While on the contrary, they con∣spire and conjure themselves against such whom they are not only bound to assist, but also to relieve of all the persecutions and oppressions which they suffer and sustain, only for their adherence to the same holy Cove∣nants. Surely these things being duly considered, this Oath, in stead of qualifying the Declaration (in lieu whereof, being more general, plausible and insnaring it was contrived and imposed) will be found a practi∣cal application of all the Wickedness and unrighteous∣ness, which is therein only speculatively declared; and may in the righteous judgement of God, by reason not only of the equality, but even of the excess hereof to London's sin, bring upon Edinburgh, London's plagues and judgements. We need not here insist to testify against the rest, who in any sort concurred or assisted in the opposition and persecution above-mentioned, the meanest part of whose accession, doth far exceed Paul's keeping the clothes of such as stoned Stephen. If we consider that the suffering and not opposing, to the utmost of our power, the shedding of innocent blood, doth involve all under that certain denouncia∣tion made by Ieremiah unto the Princes of Iudah; and all the People, Ier. 26, 15. saying, Know ye for cer∣tain, that if ye put me to death, ye shal surely bring
innocent blood upon your selves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitant thereof; the most innocent amongst us, will find himself more concerned to re∣pent of his own, then censure others for their acces∣sion. The serious thoughts whereof, may and ought justly to cause us tremble, left our Manasseh-like sin in shedding of innocent blood, provoke the Lord to wrath in such a measure as he will not pardon. But when we do reflect upon the rage, cruelty and barbarity that have ensued, the things that we have mentioned, may justly appear to be but the Beginnings of evills. For first, immediatly after the Conflict, the Arch-prelat procureth a proclamation to be emitted Prohibiting the resett and concealment of, or correspon∣dence with any of these poor men that had escaped, or had been accessary unto the late Rising, and ordaining all to pursue them as the worst of Traitors under the pain of being accounted guilty of the same Rebellion. In which Proclamation, after the Arch-Bishop had im∣pudently and absurdly laboured, that several persons, against whom, not so much as any delation or ground of suspicion could be alleaged, should, contrary to all reason, be insert, he at length prevailed that about 57 Gentlemen, Ministers and others, alleaged more eminently guilty, should be therein by Name expressed. Certainly if it be considered, that neither Reason nor Prudence do advise to seek Security only in Revenge, but rather by an attemperation of Clemency, in cases of this nature, to bring things to a compo∣sure, we must conclude, that such courses are only the product of blind prelatick-fury. 2. After the first executions at Edinbugh, the Commissioner and Lieutenant
General march unto the West, and there having con∣demned and executed several persons, as we have be∣fore mentioned, the Lieutenant General staying behind, taketh up his Quarter at Kilmarnock; and there, and from thence doth practise and issue forth such orders of cruelty, as the barbarity thereof may very probably render the Narration suspected. For. 1. The Countrey is burthened with such Lo∣calities of Corn and Straw for Troop-horses, (more then double the number of these that were amongst them) that to redeem themselves from the drudgery, they not only are content to quite the prices which the troopers ought to pay, but also to pay in to them such summs of Money, as upon computation will equalize the valued rent of the Shire. 2. Notwithstanding of all the Excise, Fines and Taxations imposed and leavyed for the maintenance of these Forces; yet upon pretence of want of moneys and Pay, the souldiours are shortly thereafter permitted to take free Quarter; and consequently are licensed to all the abuses, that either rapine or cruelty may suggest. 3. Dalzel, at and by his own hand, hath privately in his own chamber and Quarters, not only by words menaced such, as after publick examination upon the account of Intelligence, had been acquitted; but also really (by fire and sword, threatening to kill out-right, or rost and burn alive, such who being groundlessly questioned, had upon the first examination declared all they knew) examined men by tortures. 4. Such persons as he happeneth to apprehend, whether upon the suspicion of their having been with these that rose in Arms, or having reset such after the Conflict, are there-upon ordinarly stript naked to their
shirts and breeches; and thrust into Prisons, in cold, hunger. nakedness, and sometimes in extreme strait∣ness; As in Kilmarnock into dark and obscure little holes, which being destined for one man or two, and not capacious of more (though standing upright) then ten or twelve, they are so pinched, that not one of them can possibly so much as relieve himself of the continual pain of standing, by suffering his body to sink unto the ground; and unto all the former miseries have that of their own dung and excrements superadded: so that the poor men would often chuse death rather then life. Amongst which cruelties and rigors, that practised upon a petty Heritor in or about the Parish of Vchilery, deserveth to be remembered: Who, being ap∣prehended upon a groundless suspition of reset of Trai∣tors (as they tearm them) was brought to Kilmarnock-Tolbooth; where, being an old man full of obstructi∣ons, he was so suffocated with the smoak, there oc∣casioned by a coal-fire, wanting a chimney-vent, that often-times a day the souldiours have in derision carried him out as dead, and after a litle recovery by reason of the free Aire, with cruell scorn ignomini∣ously returned him unto his prison. Which Barbarity they still continued, until by extremity of such usage, he is reduced to such weakness as there is litle hope of life. 5. There is one Act, so far beyond, and without all shew and pretence of Humanity and Justice, as scarce any preface or Testimony is sufficient to perswade the belief of it; which is thus. Dalzel having ordered a party to Newmills to seise and apprehend one Finlaw, living peacably in his own house, and they about the time of Dalzel's return from Air, returning and bring∣ng with them the prisoner, he instantly calleth him to
his chamber, and examineth him privately (without so much as any one witness present) whether or not he was with the Rebels at Lanerk; the man in answer de∣clareth, that he was there when they came to the place, but upon the account of his own private affairs. The General asketh in the nixt place, whom he knew to have been there amongst them, and because the man (by declaring his ignorance) appeared unwilling to disco∣ver any, he instantly calleth the Lieutenant of the Guard, and giveth orders to carry the poor man to the Gallows and there to shoot him dead. The man being thus hurryed away, when he is brought to the place of exe∣cution, questioneth the Lieutenant, if the General was serious in what he had ordered: whereunto the Lieute∣nant replyeth that he knew nothing to the contrary; the poor man declaring his innocency, obtesteth him▪ both upon the grounds of Humanity and Christianity, that he would at least obtain him a reprival for that night, that he might prepare for Death and Eternity, and with some importunity prevaileth to move him to return to Dalzel for a grant of the licence desired: but the Lieut. General, in place of relenting, doth most severely threaten the Lieutenant himself, telling him that he would teach him to obey his orders precisely without pleading for mitigation; whereupon the Lieu∣tenant returning to the place, immediately ordereth the poor man to be shot, who was instantly stript naked and left dead upon the ground. A fact so Barbarous and Cruell, and in effect so plain a Murder, being destitute of the least shaddow of either Ordinary or Martial Law to colour it, that the horror thereof may justly render it incredible. 6. As this last Act is such as barbarity it self would condemn, so its well known that this man Dalzel
was therefore brought from Musco, where it was sup∣posed he had learned to comply with that Arbitrary Tyranny, and to exercise that Barbarous Cruelty, which there more then in any part of the Christan World, is wickedly practised, as the only proper Executioner, agreeably & accurately to serve the rigor and violence of this, accursed Prelacy. Which ex∣pectation he hath not at all frustrated: For both he and the Arch-Prelate of St Andrews, are so wickedly acted by the same spirit of spite, rage and wicked∣ness, that they have often grieved and openly com∣plained, that such whom they have supposed, and would have instantly and utterly destroyed as crimi∣nals (according to the excess of their own lust and ma∣lice, without respect to any measure or proportion of Justice) should either be proceeded against, or pu∣nished acording to the tenor of Law; accounting and impudently declaring, that these Formalities (as they are pleased to tearm the very substantials of Law, and the great security of all mens lives and fortunes) were, and are in their opinions mostly obstructive to the King's service. It were endless to enumerat all the evils, extortions, cruelties and exactions that this Mus∣covia-beast hath acted and doth practise upon that poor countrey of the West, where retaining some of his for∣ces, both Horse and Foot, the most slender suspi∣cions, or the smallest surmises, though never so false, are accounted crimes and convictions; and imme∣diatly punished with such rigorous imprisonment as we have already described; or by oppressive Quar∣tering, not only on the person suspected, but also on the whole bounds about: in which Quartering, the souldiours do behave themselves with such insolency and rapine, that not only many hundreds of families
are reduced to beggery, but in several Parishes, the countrey almost laid waste and desolate; So that now it is the common report and perswasion of all, that the West is appointed for ruine and destruc∣tion. 7. Seing this is the case of almost that whole Coun∣trey, without respect to guilt or innocency, how hard and lamentable is the condition of such who were in the late Rising, and have hithertil escaped? it is im∣possible fully to represent all their sore distress and great perplexity which they sustain, wandering and hiding themselves in woods, mountains and caves of the earth, afflicted with all the pain and misery, that the extremity of cold, nakedness and hunger, with the continual uncertainty of their Lives, can lay upon them, and hunted more then Partridges, by the vigi∣lant and cruell malice of their adversaries. We know that some of our profane Apostate Preachers (who not only think the fiery tryall a strange thing, and are offended at the cross of Christ, but preferring this worlds ease to their everlasting rest, do neither hear∣ken to the warning, nor believe the promised and often experienced consolation of suffering) have wickedly judged these poor men and their cause by the event, and affirmed that curse sa. 8.21. to be on them accomplished: but as both the sin of Sorce∣ry and the sting of this threatning, imbittered frett∣ing to the cursing of God, the very worm of the damn∣ed here recorded, do clearly discover and confute this calumny; so are these Apostate calumniators plainly and directly therein concerned, who, having such evident tokens of perdition, as are their vile Apo∣stacy and cruell persecution and reproach, may and ought to tremble in the pre-apprehensions thereof,
which, without serious repentance, they cannot e∣scape, when the righteous God who upholdeth his own with strength and joy in tribulation, shall hereafter give unto all of them, though now troubled, rest with all saints. But not only time, but heart and tongue would fail any Christian, to relate all the violences, plunderings, extortions and insolencies, that from the beginning of this Apostacy until this day have been and are commit∣ted by Military Force among us, first upon Galloway, then upon both Galloway and Nithisdale, and now upon the whole West: which as they have been Extended in bounds, so are they continually Intended in cruelty. Only this we shall say, if stobbing, wounding, beat∣ing, stripping and imprisoning mens persons, violent breaking of their houses both by day and night, and beating and wounding of wives and children, ravish∣ing and deflowring of women, forcing wives and other persons by fired matches and other tortures to discover their husbands and nearst relations, although it be not within the compass of their knowledge, and driving and spoiling all their goods that can be carried away, without respect to guilt or innocency, in as cruell a manner as ever Scotland saw exerced amongst them by a forrain enemy (as can be instanced from every corner of that Countrey) May represent our pre∣sent slavery & bondage; certainly the same is so much the more miserable and insupportable, in that all this wickedness is most unnaturally perpetrated, both by our own Countrey-men and Sworn brethren, and so much the rather to be laid to heart by al, that, as al these things are only acted and allowed by the wicked malice and blind fury of this prevailing Prelatick party, and for satisfying their insatiable hatred and revenge against
all their opposers, so is the whole Kingdom thereby disabled, and most obviously in these most dangerous times, exposed to the Invasion, of any Forrainer; As may be very evident from these considerations. 1. The West, the strength and better part of the Kingdom, is already disabled, not only by the above-mentioned oppressions, but by generall disarming, and taking of serviceable horses, and likely very shortly to be to∣tally wasted and ruined. 2. The North and High-Lands have been of late so much neglected and connived at, through the prevailing wickedness of the times, that they are wholly in disorder, and all places about infest∣ed by most insolent rapines and murthers: but since the Actors are void both of Religion & Conscience, they cannot now be guilty of either Rebellion or Sedition, and since they are rather favourers of then enemies to Prelates, it is no matter how great enemies they be to Righteousness. 3. The whole Kingdom is so ex∣hausted by exactions and impositions, so vexed by generall oppression and disorder, from which the wickedness of Prelatick Rulers, suffer no place to be exempted; & so disgusted with the violence and inhu∣manity they see done to their brethren (their own flesh) for such slight and unworthy causes and occasions, as the worst of men not interested, do justly apprehend Prelacy and Conformity to be; that all are either disa∣bled, disheartened, or disobleiged from the service of King and Countrey. 4. There remaineth no strength nor force amongst us, but these two regiments of foot and nine troops of horses, which even with the addi∣tion of the five more intended, will not in all exceed 2000 foot and 1000 horse, and yet are they all and more then the Countrey can wel bear, and these so de∣bauched by licentiousness, cruelty and rapine, that
neither can their hearts endure, nor their hands be strong against an enemy. These are the fruits of our departing from the Lord, and again erecting and admit∣ting this accursed Prelacy. O! that God would cause us to know how evill and bitter they are; but the Pre∣lats who fear not God, regard not the Common∣wealth, let the Covenant & Conscience be rooted out, then come on us what will: these are the only enemies of their usurpations & wicked lusts, and therefore must be accounted so both to King and Countrey; against these are our forces leavyed and maintained, and unto this design their numbers must be modelled and our exactions proportioned: The arraying of the Coun∣trey and establishing of the Militia conform to our an∣cient Laws and Liberties may possibly arm the Prelats enemies; surely that course would not so violently press Conformity, and execute their cruelty, nor so largely gratify a few Nobles, who by the command of the troops must be made sharers of the spoil and booty, and so engaged for these vile Prelates against the poor Countrey. O blinded Nobles! are not the wealth and peace of the Countrey your riches and stability? O abject Scotland! how art thou abondoned? This being the design, rage and jealousy of the tyran∣nizing Prelats, in order thereunto there must be five troops more added to these already leavyed, and the Countrey yet more oppressed for the securing and establishing of their wickedness. 2, They are endea∣vouring by all means to have the Declaration against the Covenant generally pressed, that either by violent straining they may destroy all conscience thereof, or may more fully discover, and more effectually reach all the faithful in the Land, whom by the test of a refusal they purpose to stage and severely punish as enemies to
Authority. We shall not offer here to adde any thing against this Declaration. If all that the Lord hath done in this Land now by the space of near an 100 years, all that his servants have formerly declared and testifyed, and now of late have witnessed and sealed with thr blood, and all the tenor and purpose of this discourse avail not to justify our holy Covenants, and condemn this horrid Apostacy and wicked Declaration, nothing certainly will be able to perswade, and the mighty power of God can only convert. Only we have rea∣son to fear that the same spirit of deceat, which, under the colour of due obedience to lawful Authority, en∣snared wretched Edinburgh to a combination and con∣spiracy against the Lord and his Anointed, may renew the same practise upon the whole Land, for the more easy involving of such in this Apostacy, whom possibly the gross and palpable wickedness of the Declaration might deterre: And to such we give this warning, that as all Powers are subordinat to the most High, and appointed and limited by His holy will and command∣ment, for his own glory and the Peoples good; and as our Alleagiance was, and standeth perpetually and expresly thus qualifyed, viz. in defence of Religion and Liberty, according to our first and second Covenants; and lastly, seing all Alleagiance and obedience to any created Power whatsoever, (though in the construction of charity apparently indefinite, yet) of it's own nature is indispensibly thus restricted; To renew the same, or take any the like Oath of Alleagiance purely and simply, purposely omitting the former and due Restriction, especially where the Powers are in most manifest and notorious Rebellion against the Lord, and opposition to his Cause and Covenant, is in effect equivalent to to an express rejecting and dis-owning of the same Li∣mitation,
and of the Soveraign Prerogative of the Great God and King over all, which is thereby reserv∣ed; & as much as in plain terms to affirm, that what∣ever abused Authority shall command or do, either as to the overturning of the VVork of God, subverting of Reli∣gion, destroying of Rights & Liberties, or persecuting of all the Faithful to the utmost extremity, we shall not only stupidly endure it, but actively concur with & assist in all this Tyranny. And if this be not more, yea double wickdness above all that the Declaration doth import, let all men consider. O! all ye who desire to behold the good that God will do for His People, beware of this High Rebellion against Him. 3. As all restraints of either Conscience or Law are now wickedly taken off, and only a convenient oppurtunity waited for, to re-introduce that dead car∣case of Formality, the Service-book, and the whole bulk of these corrupt Ceremonies and pernicious Super∣stitions, that have been formerly, and alwayes found so destructive to the light & power of the Gospell, & are so vain and ridiculous in themselves, that nothing but the very, spirit of darkness and judiciall delusion from the Lord, can induce men to such fopperies; so may we certainly expect the re-imposing of this heavy yoke, and all the Sin, Superstition, Persecution and Wrath which necessarily do attend it, except we abide stedfast in the Lord's Cause and Covenant, instantly in∣treating and patiently waiting for His Salvation, and glorious appearance again in this Land. Thus we have represented in part both the Sin, Sufferings and Distresses that ly upon the whole Land; which though they be most heavy and greivous in
themselves, yet are they in their Tendency & Presage more to be regarded. Can any man seriously look upon the hatred and scorn of that Light and Truth? wherein once we gloried, the spite against the Holy Covenant and all Conscience, the Blaphemy and sin against God, and the violence and persecution against all such as fear His Name, whereby the enemy rageth and their tu∣mult continually increaseth, and not be astonished? Is there any who believeth that God is, and that His Words are Truths and all His Wayes judgements, His Threatnings sure and certain, His jealousy as a con∣suming fire, His wrath so dreadful and His indignation so terrible, that only the same Omnipotency which inflicteth the strokes, can sustain poor passive wretches from evanishing at it's smallest rebukes, and yet shall sustain them eternally, and not tremble because of the provocation of all these Abominations? O! that such whom the Love of Christ hath not constrained, nor the tears and weeping of a departing Saviour moved, might be yet perswaded by the Terror of the Lord, & that the dread of God might make their hearts soft. Surely abounding sin is the greatest Woe, and prevail∣ing transgression the greatest cause of mourning; but above all sins and transgressions, Christ despised in His Gospell and Ordinances, and persecuted in His mem∣bers, is the most mournful and fearful: Which as it scattered and destroyed the Lord's peculiar People and Nation, dear to Him above all Nations, and hath overturned and ruined the fairest part of the Christian World, either in Barbarity or gross Darkness; so is it the great condemnation of the whole World. This is the work and wickedness of accursed Prelacy, most Perjurious in it's Rise and ever Antichristian in it's De∣signes and Effects, as all who have hearts to understand
what we have here declared, and eyes to see the pre∣sent state and condition of matters, must and will ac∣knowledge. This is thy Sin, O Scotland, and, if mercy prevent it not, shall be thy ruine. This is the Voice, Testimony and Warning of all the sufferings of the Lord's people; who though continually afflicted and persecuted in their bodies, & though their souls be ex∣ceedingly filled with the contempt of the proud; yet have not nor dare not deny the Lord, His Work, nor His holy Covenant: whom though the Lord hath caused to turn back from the enemy, and given for a spoil to them that hate them, yea given them as sheep for meat, and made them a reproach, a scorn and a derision; yet have they nor forgotten the Lord nor dealt falsly in His Covenant. O! that men would! consider this Grace of God, whereby as he conforteth and sustaineth his servants in all their afflictions; so he warneth backsliders to return, and all to flee from the wrath that is to come, and to save themselves from this wicked generation: Which Grace, as it allayeth to, the Faithful the smart, so ought it to remove from all the scandal of our Lord's cross, and is indeed that strength and presence of the Captain of our salvation (who was made perfect by suffering) with all His suf∣ferers, giving for the present joy and peace, and after∣wards assured victory. Now, seing it is the Lord who hath so visibly brought upon us these sore Trialls, that such as are ap∣proved may be made manifest, and so graciously de∣livereth them from the temptation thereof, yea there∣by refineth, purifyeth and maketh many white, that they may be more abundant Partakers both of His Holiness and of His Glory, and also eminently bear∣eth witness to the Truth, Grace and Power of His
great Work, His holy Covenant, and precious Or∣dinances and Ministry amongst us, clearing them by His own Testimony of all these calumnies, wherewith either through the invention of some men's malice, or the occasion of other mens weakness and sin, they were formerly aspersed, we shall shut up this discourse with this one word of exhortation. Great hath been the Sin of this Land in not believing and obeying the glorious Gospell, in not receaving the Lord Jesus in our hearts, and witnessing His Light and Grace and Glory in our lives and conversations, but in resting on the outward forms and appearances of the true Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Govern∣ment, without labouring after the power of Reform∣ation, and beauty of holiness (the only grace and blessing of all these enjoyments) and in perverting and mannaging the possession and profession of all these things unto selfish ends and worldly advantages, O foolish people and unwise, have we thus requited the Lord for all these mercies of His Gospell, pure Ordi∣nances and Holy Covenants, to corrupt and deprave them from that great end of the Glory of His grace and mercy in our salvation, unto the base designs of serving and satifying our own lusts to His dishonour? And therefore is it that the Lord, having often in his mer∣cy corrected and warned us, hath now at length given us over unto this horrid Apostacy and Defection; where∣by, as the latent malice and hypocrisy of many, and the great fainting and want of zeal in all, have been manifestly discovered; so the Lord is feeding the wicked with their own delusions, and putting the zeal and constancy of all to the Test, and in effect ripening this whole Land, either for a glorious deliverance from that perverse spirit and generation of Antichrist, that
hath been long mingled in the midst of us, and even from the dayes of our first Reformation, hath retained and continued the old enmity against the Lord Jesus and His blessed Gospell and Kingdom; or else for a totall and final overthrow in utter darkness and desolation. And therefore O Scotland, because the Lord loved thy Fathers, and delighteth not in thy destruction, hath He, after all our fearful backsliding and sinful fainting and departing which testify against us, neither left Himself nor us without a witness; but raised up a∣mongst us His own faithful Servants and our bre∣thren, with whom we are all equally and indissolubly engaged in the same righteous Cause and Covenant, & by the mighty power of His grace, from the pure zeal of His Glory, enabled them first to venture and then to lay down their lives for the Testimony of His Work and Covenant, that we may yet at length consider and understand, that these were no more the labour and de∣vices of carnal designs, then that corruption and weak∣ness of flesh & blood could triumph both over it self & death & hell the chief of terrors. O! that men would therefore lay to heart their bonds & Engagements unto the Lord, repent of their backslidings, and cease from their opposition to His Cause & Covenant; at least that such whom the Lord hath not abandoned unto that depth of Apostacy, whereunto others have made de∣fection, would yet be wise & instructed, repent of their fainting & Neutrality in the cause of God, & their conni∣vance or complyance with the declared enemies there∣of, & beware of that wicked Declaration against the Co∣venant, or any other Oath and Subscription likely to be the snare and temptation of these times, which either under the pretext of Peace and Order, or of due Obedience unto lawful Authority may be wicked∣ly invented and imposed, really for the suppressing of
Truth, and advancing of this Rebellion against the most High God, and the establishing of this An∣tichristian Prelatick-Tyranny. We have already fully detected the mask and design of such impostures; He who hath given Authority and Power unto Kings and Princes, and rendered the same Sacred by His holy Sanction and Command, as he hath often punished their Ingratitude and Usurpation against His own So∣veraignity; so will He not hold that people guiltless, who, being both His Creatures and sworn Subjects, either connive at, or comply with such Rebellious Princes in their wickedness. Shall both the Law of God, and the very Propension of the heart and blood to the love and obedience of Parents, cede to the obe∣dience of Kings and Rulers, for the good and preser∣vation of the Common-wealth, and shall not far more all Alleagiance & obedience to the same Kings & Rulers, cede and give place to our Obedience to the Most High our only Soveraign Lord, and the conscience of His holy Oath and Commandments, for advancement of his glory, the great and only end of all things? Fix it therefore in your hearts, first to love and fear the Lord our God, and then to honour and obey the King; and let the sincere and inward love of our Lord Jesus Christ, the dear esteem of his precious Gospel, and the remem∣brance of our most sacred and solemn Oaths and Co∣venants, and of that beauty, power and glory of His pure Ordinances, Ministry and Government which we once enjoyed, alwayes dwell in your hearts, and ever determine and establish you to resist and disown all wicked Usurpations against the Lord and His Anoint∣ed, all Invasions against His Crown and Prerogative, all Corruptions and Humane Inventions in His pure Worship and Ordinances, all perversion of the true
Government and comely Order in His house, and al violations of these indispensible & holy Engagements, whereby this whole Nation is perpetually joyned unto the Lord; and also ever animat yow to Do or Suffer for the Lords great Name and these precious & important concernments, as He requireth; lest if ye either faint in your mindes, or give up your selves to the delusion of some carnal distinction, quiting the founder for the safer part, against the explicit Testimo∣ny, or implicit inclination of your own Consciences (which later, if sincerely aiming at the glory of God, and in nothing repugnant to His holy Word, is no otherwise to be regarded in times of temptation, then as that promised secret leading of the blind in the way they know not) you not only lose your Crown, but pro∣voke the Lord to cause all the Churches know by your plagues, that He it is who searcheth the reins & hearts. But unto these few names in Scotland that have ap∣peared zealous for God, & have not forgotten His Co∣venant in these declining times, & all these who favour their Righteous Cause; The Lord (who liveth & was dead, and is alive for evermore, Amen,) knoweth your works, tribulation & poverty (but yow are rich) and also the blasphemy of them which say they are Christians & are not, but are the synagogue of Anti∣christ, Fear none of these things which yow do or shall suffer, your afflictions are but for Triall, and may be Short: be Faithful unto the death and ye shall have the Crown of life. And as ye love God & the Father of our Lord Jesus, who gave His only and eternall de∣light unto the death for us Sinners; as ye love our Lord Jesus Christ who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood; as ye love the Holy Spirit of Grace who breatheth all this love into our hearts, and
comforteth and sealeth us unto the day of redemption; as ye love the blessed Gospel, in the light whereof all this love is revealed, and God therein mainly glo∣rified; as ye love the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood; as ye love (for your own souls and for your posterity) eternal life; as ye love poor Scotland and it's deliverance from the dreadful and imminent wrath of God; and as you love the preservation of all Interests either Spiritual, Temporal or Eternal, Adhere stedfastly to the holy Covenants that Sacred and Firm Bond and Engage∣ment unto all duties of Religion and Righteousness, our blessed sealed Charter of all the Lord's blessings and ordinances, especially of that great Ordinance of the Ministry and Government of the Lord's house, which He himself hath appointed the hedge of all other Ordinances, and the great and most effectual mean of the Gospel's establishment and advancement. For, as it is only the holy zeal of God inspired and animated by the fervent love of our Lord Jesus, and the fear of the Lord's great Name, and the regard of His sacred Oath, that can make you of quick under∣standing in these perillous times, for the discovering of both duties and dangers, and strengthen you with all might, either for Doing or Suffering, that you may endure unto the end; so you may be assured, that if the Lord's thoughts toward Scotland be thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give us an expected end (as we have great ground and perswasion of hope) it shall be upon the broken plank of this despised Cove∣nant, that this tossed and ship-wrackt Church shall be preserved, in midst of all these fluctuations, and at length attain to it's desired haven of Peace and Truth. Yea though this Apostacy and persecution should pre∣vail
to wear out the saints of the most High, and the Lord (because of the overspreading of abomination) should determine and bring upon us utter desolation; yet shall this your faithfulness be your Peace, joy and Victory. Let all therefore that desire to be found faithful, look unto Jesus and his joy; that with Him enduring the cross and despising the shame, we may neither faint nor be weary, but in end be partakers of his Victory, Throne and Crown. Thus we have seen and declared the great Work of God in this Land, from the first times of our Reforma∣tion unto this day; we have also teen our manifold provocations, whereby we have often Turned, Tempt∣ed and Provoked the most High; and all these judge∣ments, Temptations and Discoveries, wherewith, by the space of now more then an Hundred years, he hath corrected and exercised us; and we are at length arrived unto, and have considered the present state and posture of our affairs: Wherein though 1. the extremity of Apostacy, exceeding all that any age can parallel, and aggreageable by all the circumstances of most clear and glorious Manifestations, most solemn and sacred En∣gagements, most sudden and causeless backsliding, and most national daring and violent defection that any Church can be charged with. 2. The extremity of Persecution and Violence, which, considering either the Actors; (once ring-leaders, now Apostats from the same Holy Covenant which they persecut) or the Manner, by Hostile and Military Force, without so much as regarding their own Lawes which they pre∣tend for warrant; or the cruelty and excess, whereby mens lives are imbittered, making them prefer Death to the slaveries and insolencies which they, sustain, Are
not to be instanced in any Christian Church. 3. The extremity of Sin and profanity, and of the enemies boasting and blasphemy, whose mouths are set against the Heavens, and all the spite of their tongues and in∣dignation of their hearts, against the holy Covenant and tenderness of conscience, over which and all their followers, they wickedly insult and rejoyce. And 4. the extremity of mens fainting and deserting so Good a Cause; Which in their hearts they secretly own and approve, but dare not avow, yea are ready to deny for fear of the Adversaries, Though, we say, these extremities (undenyably apparent in our present condition) do sadly denounce unto this Land, the worst and most woful of all extremities, even utter for∣saking and desolation, and that the End is come; yet notwithstanding all these hopeless and desperat appear∣ances, it is the Lord who causeth light to shine out of darkness, and saith in the evening it shall be light, who saith unto dry bones, live, and calleth his Peo∣ple out of their graves, who even calleth things that are not as though they were, in whom all the seekers of His face ought to rejoyce, and joy in the God of their salvation. Therefore, although that over and above all these menacing evils, the power and pride of the Enemy should yet more prevail, even many degrees above all the appearances of Human Hope or Help, & all Neighbouring Nations should not only give them the leisure and conveniency, but with all their might conspire and concurre with our enemies, to intend their persecution & strengthen their Apostacy; yet are the Lord's Faithful, not only par∣takers of that River, the streams whereof make glad the City of God, though surrounded with the siege of of Nations, Batteries of mountains, and insurrections
of the Universe against it, and are built on that rock against which the very gates of hell cannot prevail, and do also know that their God whom they fear is able to deliver them from this fiery Triall, and He will de∣liver them from their persecuters; and if not, that nothing save the design of greater glory to this own Name, in a greater mercy and salvation to His People shall impede it: but all that love the Lord's Salvation have also fair ground of hope, that the Lord, as he will pour out His wrath upon his adversaries, so will He remember for Scotland his Covenant; awake and give a shout against His enemies; and that, now when He seeth their wrath, how they behave themselves strange∣ly, and say our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this, the Lord will bring forth for His rem∣nant (even that holy seed which shall be the substance of this Land) that Deliverance which is laid up in store with Him, and sealed up amongst His treasures. For unto God belongeth vengeance and recompense, even the vengeance of His broken Covenant, of His dear Saints blood, and of His polluted Sanctuary. The adversaries foot shal slide in due time, for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them, make haste. For the Lord shall judge his people and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that our power is gone, and there is none shut up or left: And the Lord shall say, see now that I, even I am He, and there is no God with me: I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand; for I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. if I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
judgement, I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood (and my sword shall devour flesh) and that with the blood of the slain and the cap∣tives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. Rejoyce, O ye Nations, with his people, for He will avenge the blood of His Servants, and will render ven∣geance to His adversaries, and will be mercifull unto His Land and to His People. This is the Song which God hath taught us, and therewith we shut up and seal the FAITH AND PATIENCE OF THE SAINTS. AND now, having finished the Narration in∣tended of the Work of God, and having seen and being persuaded that all the degrees and Passages of its Progress and Advancement, were the very vestiges of the Lords ascendent Power and Glory, which He hath also sealed by the Salvation of many thousands for our assured con∣firmation, that as this Work is of God, so shall it not come to nought; But that these An∣tichristian  who oppose it, though in the same Spirit and Power of Darkness, which hath mainly caused and procured all the sin, tempta∣tion and ruine that hath befallen any Gospel-Church,  the blessed coming of our Lord JESUS in the fleh, they should arise unto, yea
surmount the very height of the Papacy and Anti∣christ himself, in their Persecutions & Tyranny; They shall nevertheless in the end, be found even to fight against God, and perish for ever in their gain-saying. As we do therefore desire to remain stedfast, immoveable, and always abounding in the Work of the Lord, and every point and circumstance thereof, without faint∣ing or wearying even unto the Death. in and over which the Lord hath caused His faithful wit∣nesses so gloriously to Triumph; so we do only here subjoyn, for the clear and unanswerable conviction and condemnation of the perfidy and wickedness of these accursed Prelates, both be∣fore the World and even in their own conscienc∣es, if any sense thereof do yet remain: That though we had never seen any of these great and glorious things, whereby the Lord since the Year 1637. did revive, confirm and magnify His Work amongst us, and that the National Covenant had net been since retaken much less explain∣ed and established, nor the League and Covenant ensued it; Yet since the same doth still stand in the plain and simple terms, wherein it was con∣ceaved, and in that sense and meaning, wherein both it's express Words and all the circumstanc∣es which we have before observed do plainly evince that it was at first taken; as this Cove∣nant
doth remain unto this Day (notwithstand∣ing all the Prelats wickedness, perjury and violence) unrepeal'd or condemned, and by no contrary explanation or gloss, either is or can be detorted, from being an undenyable abju∣ration of accursed Prelacy and all it's corrup∣tions; so is it a certain, fixed and immoveable foundation for all the Work of God that hath ensued, and a very sure ground of confidence to all who seriously perpend, and firmly adhere to it, that the Lord who loved us of old, and chosed our Fathers, shall yet again by his mighty Spirit and Power, turn the hearts of the Chil∣dren unto the Fathers, and bring us back unto the Lord God of our Fathers, and upon this same Foundation, yet repair our breaches, build up the old wastes, & raise & rear up His Glory. FINIS.
The last SPEECHES AND TESTIMONIES Of some who have Suffered for the TRUTH IN SCOTLAND, Since the Year 1660. The last Speech of the MARQUES of ARGILE, At his Death in Edinburgh, May 27. 1661. MANY will expect that I speak many things, and according to their several opinions and dispositions, so will their expectations be from me, and con∣structions of me; But I resolve to disap∣point many, for I come not hither to justify my self,
but the Lord, VVho is Holy in all His wayes and Righteous in all His VVorks, Holy and blessed is His Name; Neither come I to condemn others: I know many. will expect that I will speak against the hardness of the Sentence, pronounced against me; But I will say nothing to it. I bless the Lord, I pardon all men, as I desire to be pardoned of the Lord my self: Let the will of the Lord be done; That is all that I desire. I hope that ye will have more charity to me now, then yee would have had at an other time, seing I speak before the Lord, to whom I must give an account very shortly. I know very well that my words have had but very litle weight with many: And that many have mistaken my Words & Actings both: Many have thought me to be a great Enemy to these great works, that have of late, been brought to pass. But do not mistake me, good People: I speak it in the presence of the Lord, I entered not upon the Work of Refor∣mation, with any design of advantage to my self, or prejudice to the King and his Government; As my later Will which was written 1655. and thereafter de∣livered to a Friend (in whose hands it still remaineth) can show. As for these Calumnies that have gone abroad of me, I blesse God, I know them to be no more: And as I go to make a reckoning to My God, I am free as to any of these, concerning the King's Person or Government. I was Real and Cordial in my desires to bring the King home, and in my En∣deavours for Him when he was at home, and I had no correspondence with the Adversaries Army, nor any of them, in the time when his Majesty was in Scot∣land; Nor had I any accession to his late Majesties
horrid and execrable Murther, by Councel or Knowledge of it, or any other manner of way. This is a Truth, as I shall answer to my Judge. And all the time his Majesty was in Scotland, I was still endea∣vouring His advantage; my Conscience beareth me witness in it. So much to that Particular. And (turning about he said) I hope, Gentlemen, you will all remem∣ber these. I confess, many look on my Condition as a Suffering condition: But I bless the Lord, that He that hath gone before me, hath trod the Wine-press of the Fa∣ther's wrath; by whose Sufferings, I hope that my Sufferings shall not be Eternal. I bless Him that hath taken away the sting of my Sufferings: I may say that my Charter was Sealed to day; for the Lord hath said to me, SON, BE OF GOOD CHEER, THY SINS ARE FREELY FORGIVEN THEE: And so I hope my Sufferings shall be very easy. And ye know the Scripture saith, the Captain of our Salvation was made perfect by Sufferings. I shall not speak much to these things for which I am condemned, lest I seem to condemn others: It's well known, it's only for Compliance, which was the Epidemicall fault of the Nation. I wish the Lord to Pardon them: I say no more. There was an expression in these Papers presented by me to the Parliament, of the Contagion of these times; Which may by some be misconstructed, as if I intend∣ed to lay an Imputation upon the Work of Reforma∣tion: But I declare that I intended no such thing; But only related to the corruptions and failings of men, oc∣casioned by the Prevailing of the Usurping Powers. At this he turned and took them all witnesses.
Now, Gentlemen, concerning the Nation, I think there are three sorts of People that take up much of the World and of this Nation. There is 1. the openly Prophane: And truely I may say, though I have been a prisoner, I have not had mine ears shut; I hear assuredly, that Drinking, Swearing, Whoring were never more Common, never more Countenanced then now they are. Truly if Magistrats were here, I would say to them, if they lay forth their power for glorifying of God, by restraining this, they should fare the better; if they continue in not restraining, they shall fare the worse. I say no more, but either let People shun Prophanity and Magistrats restrain it, or assuredly the wrath of God shall follow on it. 2. Others are not openly Prophane (everyone will not allow that) but yet they are Gallio's in the matter: If matters go well as to their Private Interest, they care not whether the Church of God sink or swim. But whatever they think, God hath laid Engagements upon Scotland: We are tyed by Covenants to Reli∣gion and Reformation: These that were then Unborn are yet engaged; and in our Baptisme we are engaged to it. And it passeth the power of all the Magistrats under heaven to absolve them from the Oath or God: They deceave themselves, and it may be would de∣ceave others that think otherwise. But I would cave∣at this, People will be ready to think this a kind of instigation to Rebellion in me; But they are very far wrong that think Religion and Loyalty are not well con∣sistent. Whoever they be that separate them, Reli∣gion is not to be blamed, but They. It's true, it's the duty of every Christian to be Loyall; yet I think the Orders of things are to be observed as well as their Natures; the Order of Religion as well as the Nature
of it. Religion must not be the Cock-boat, it must be the Ship. God must have what is His, as well as Caesar what is His: And These are the best Subjects that are the best Christians. And that I am looked on as a Friend to Reformation, is my Glory. 3. There is another sort that are truly Godly: And to them I must say what I fear, & every one hath reason to fear (it's good to fear evil) It's true the Lord may pre∣vent it; but if He do not (and truly I cannot forsee any probability of it) Times are like either to be very Sinning or very Suffering Times: And let Christians make their choice: There is a sad Dilemma in the business SIN or SUFFER; and surely, he that would choise the Better part will choise to Suffer. Others that will choise to Sin, shall not escape Suffer∣ing; They shall Suffer, but it may be, not as I do (turning about and, pointing to the Maiden) but worse: Mine is but Temporal, theirs shall be Eternal; when I shall be Singing, they shall be Howling. Beware therefore of Sin whatever yow are aware of, especial∣ly in such times. Yet I cannot say of my own Condition, but that the Lord in his Providence hath mind of Mercy to me even in this World: For if I had been more favourably dealt with, I fear I might have been overcome with Temptations, as many others are, and many more I fear will be; And so should have gone out of the World, with a more polluted Conscience, then through the mercy of God now I have. And hence my Condition is such now, as when I am gone, will be seen not to have been such as many imagined. It's fit God take me away, before I fall into these Temp∣tations that I see others are falling into▪ and many
others I fear will fall: I wish the Lord may Prevent it. Yet blessed be His Name, that I am keeped both from present evils & evils to come. Here he turned about a litle & spoke some words to Mr Hutchison, when turning again to the People, he spoke as followeth. Some may expect I will regrete my own condition: but truly I neither grudge nor repine; nor desire any revenge. And I declare I do not repent my last going up to Lon∣don; for I had alwayes rather have Suffered any thing, then ly under Reproaches as I did. I desire not that the Lord should judge any man; nor do I judge any but my Self: I wish, as the Lord hath pardoned me, so He may pardon them for this and other things; and what they have done to me, may never meet them in their accounts. I have no more to say, but to beg the Lord, that when I go away, he would Bless every one that stayeth behind. His last Words, immediatly before he laid his Head on the Block after his doublet was off, were these. I desire you, Gentlemen, all that hear me this day to take notice (and I wish that all who see me might hear me) that now when I am entering into Eternity, and am to appear before my Judge; & as I desire Salvation and do expect eternall Salvation and happiness from Him, from my Birth to my Scaffold, I am free from any accession by my Knowledge, concerning Counsel or any other way to his late Ma. death; And I pray the Lord preserve his present Maj. and to pour his best blessings on his Person and Government; and the Lord give him good and faithful councellors. Turn-about to his Friends, he said, Many Christians may stumble at this, and my Friends may be discontented; But when things are rightly considered, my freinds
have no Discredit of Me, nor Christians no Stum∣bling block, but rather an Encouragement. The last Speech and Testimony of MR JAMES GUTHRIE, Minister of the Gospel at Sterlin, at his Death at Edinburgh, Jun. 1. 1661. which a day or two before his Death he wrot, and left with some of his Friends sealed and attested under his own hand. MEn and Brethren, I fear many of yow become hither to gaze, rather then to be edified by the carriage and last words of a dying man: But if any have an hear to hear, as I hope some of this great con∣fluence have, I desire your audience to a few words. I am come hither to lay down this earthly Tabernacle and mortal flesh of mine; and I bless God, through His Grace I do it willingly and not by constraint. I say, I suffer willingly: If I had been so minded, I might have made a diversion, and not been a Prisoner; But being conscious to my Self of nothing worthy of Death or of Bonds, I would not stain my Innocency with the suspicion of guiltiness by my withdrawing: neither have I wanted opportunities and advantages to escape since I was Prisoner, not by the fault of my keepers (God knoweth) but otherwise; But neither for this had I Light or Liberty; left I should reflect upon the Lord's Name, and offend the Generation of
the Righteous: And if some men have not been mis∣taken, or dealt deceatfully in telling me so, I might have avoided not only the severity of the Sentence, but also had much favor and countenance, by com∣plying with the courses of the time: But I durst not redeem my Life with the loss of my Integrity; God knoweth I durst not; and that since I was Prisoner, He hath so holden me by the hand, that he never suf∣fered me to bring it in debate in my inward thoughts, much less to propone or hearken to any overture of that kind. I did judge it better to Suffer then to Sin; And therefore I am come hither to lay down my life this day. And I bless God, I die not as a Fool; Not that I have any thing wherein to glory in my self: I ac∣knowledge that I am a Sinner, yea one of the greatest and vilest that hes owned a profession of Religion, and one of the most unworthy that hes Preached the Gos∣pel; my corruptions have been strong and many, and have made me a sinner in all things, yea even in fol∣lowing my duty: And therefore Righteousness have I none of mine own, all is vile; But I do beleeve that Jesus Christ came into the World to save sinners whereof I am Chief: Through Faith in his Righteous∣ness and Blood have I obtained Mercy; and through Him and Him alone, have I the hope of a blessed con∣quest and Victory over Sin, and Sathan, and Hell, and Death, and that I shall attain unto the Resur∣rection of the Just; and be made Partaker of Eternal Life. I know in whom I have beleeved, and that He is able to keep than which I have committed unto Him against that day. I have Preached Salvation through His Name, and as I have preached so do I Beleeve, and do commend the Riches of His Free-grace
and Faith in His Name unto yow all, as the only way whereby ye can be saved. And as I bless the Lord that I die not as a fool; so also that I die not for Evil-doing. Not a few of yow may happily judge, that I suffer as a Thief, or as a Murtherer, or as an evil Doer, or as an Bussy body in other mens matters. It was the lot of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and hath been of many of His Pre∣cious Servants and People to suffer by the World as evil Doers: & as my soul scareth not at it, but desireth to rejoice in being brought into Conformity with my Blessed Head, and so blessed a Company in this thing; so do I desire and Pray that I may be to none of yow to day, upon this account a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: Blessed is he that shall not be offended at Jesus Christ and his poor servants and members, be∣cause of their being condemned as evil doers by the World. God is my record, that in these things, for which Sentence of Death hath passed against me, I have a good Conscience: I bless God, they are not matters of Complyance with Sectaries, or Designes or Practices against His Majest. Person or Government, or the Person or Government of His Royal Father: My heart (I bless God) is conscious unto no Disloalty; Nay, Loyal I have been, and I commend it unto you to be Loyal and obedient in the Lord. True Piety is the foundation of True Loyalty: A wicked man may be a flatterer and a Time-server, but he will never be a Loyal Subject. But to return to my purpose, the matters for which I am condemned, are matters be∣longing to my Calling and Function as a Minister of the Gospel, such as the Discovery and Reproving of Sin; The pressing the holding fast of the Oath of God in the Covenant, and preserving and carrying on the
Work of Religion and Reformation according there∣to; And Denying to acknowledge the Civil Magi∣strat as the Proper Competent Iudge in causes Eccle∣siastical: That in all these things which (God so or∣dering by His gracious Providence) are the grounds of my Inditement and Death, I have a good Conscience, as having walked therein according to the Light and Rule of God's Word, and as did become a Minister of the Gospel. I do also bless the Lord, that I do not die as one not desired. I know that by not a few I neither have been nor am desired. It hath been my lot to have been a man of Contention and Sorrow: But it is my comfort, that for my own things I have not contended, but for the things of Jesus Christ, for what relateth to His Interest and Work, and the well being of His People. In order to the preserving and promoting of these, I did Protest against, and stood in Opposition unto these late Assemblies at St Andrewes, Dundee and Edinburgh; and the Publick Resolutions for bringing the Malig∣nant Party into the Judicatories and Armies of this Kingdom, conceaving the same contrary to the Word of God, and to our Solemn Covenants and Engage∣ments; and to be an inlet to Defection, and to the Ruine and destruction of the Work of God. And it is now manifest to many consciences, that I have not been therein mistaken; nor was not fighting against a man of straw. I was also desirous and did use some poor Endeavours to have the Church of God purged of Insufficient and Scandalous and Corrupt Ministers and Elders; for these things I have been mistaken by some, and hated by others: But I bless the Lord, as I had the testimony of my own Conscience; so I was and am therein approven, in the consciences of many
of the Lord's precious Servants and People; and how little soever I may die Desired by some, yet by these I know I do die Desired, and their approbation, and prayers, and affection is of more value with me, then the Contradiction, or Reproach, or Hatred of many others; the love of the one I cannot Recompence, and the mistake, or hatred, or reproach of the other; I do with all my heart Forgive; and wherein I have offended any of them, do beg their mercy and forgive∣ness. I do from my soul wish that my death may be profitable unto both, that the one may be confirmed and established in the straight wayes of the Lord, and that the other (if the Lord so will) may be convinced, & cease from these things that are not good, & do not Edify but Destroy. One thing I would warn yow all of, that God is wroth, yea very wroth with Scotland, and threatneth to depart and remove His candlestick: The causes of his wrath are many, and would to God it were not One great cause, that Causes of Wrath are despised and rejected of men. Consider the case that is record∣ed Ier. 36. and the consequence of it, and tremble and fear. I cannot but also say, that there is a great addi∣tion and increase of wrath. 1. By that deludge of Pro∣phanity that overfloweth all the Land, and hath reins loosed unto it every where, in so far that many have lost not only all use and exercise of Religion, but even of Morality, and that common Civility that is to be found amongst the Heathen. 2. By that horrible Treachery and Perjury that is in the matter of the Co∣venant, and Cause of God, and Work of Reforma∣tion: Be astonished, O ye Heavens at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the Lord; for my People have committed two evils, they have
forsaken me the fountain of living waters, & hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water: Shall be break the Covenant, and prosper? Shal the throne of iniquity have fellowship with God, which frameth mischief by a Law? I fear the Lord be about to bring a Sword on these Lands, which shall avenge the quarrell of His Covenant. 3. Horrible Ingratitude: The Lord after 10 years oppres∣sion & bondage hath broken the yoke of Strangers from off our necks; but what do we render unto Him for this goodness? Most of the fruit of our delivery is to work wickedness, and to strengthen our Selves to do evill. 4. A most dreadful Idolatry, and sa∣crificing to the Creature: We have changed the glory of the Incorruptible God, into the image of a corruptible Man, in whom many have placed almost all their Salvation and desire, and have turned that which might have been a Blessing un∣to us (being kept in a due line of Subordination under God) into an Idol of Jealousy, by preferring it before him. God is also wroth with a generation of Carnal, Corrupt, Time-serving Ministers: I know and bear testimony that in the Church of Scotland, there is a True and Faithful Ministry: Blessed be God, we have yet many who study their duty, and desire to be found faithful to their Lord and Master; And I pray you to Honor, and Reverence, and Esteem much of these for their Works sake: And I pray them to be encouraged in their Lord and Master, who is with them to make them as iron-pillars, and brazen walls, and as a strong defenced city in the faithful fol∣lowing of their duty: But oh! that there were not too many who mind Earthly things, and are enemies to the cross of Jesus Christ, who push with the side and shoulder, who strengthen the hands of evill
doers, who make themselves transgressors, by stu∣studying to build again what they did formerly warrant∣ably destroy, I mean PRELACY, and the CERE¦MONIES, and the SERVICE-BOOK, a Mystery of iniquity that works amongst us, whose steps lead unto the house of the great Whore, BABYLON, the Mother of fornications: Or whosoever else he be that buildeth this Jericho again, let him take heed of the curse of Hiel the Bethelite, and of that flying roll thereatened Zech. 5. And let all Ministers take heed that they Watch, and be Stedfast in the Faith, and quit themselves like men, and be strong; and give faithful and seasonable Warning concerning Sin and Duty. Many of the Lords People do sadly complain of the fainting and silence of many Watchmen; And it concerneth them to consider what God calleth for at their hands in such a day: Silence now in a Watch∣man, when he is so much called to speak, and give his Testimony upon the Peril of his life, is doubtless a great Sin. The Lord open the mouths of His Servants to speak his word with all boldness, that Covenant-breaking may be discovered and reproved, and that the Kingdom of Jesus Christ may not be supplanted, nor the souls of His People destroyed without a wit∣ness. I have but a few words moe to adde: All that are Profane amongst you, I exhort them to Repen∣tance, for the day of the Lord's vengeance hasteneth and is near: But there is yet a door of mercy open for you, if ye will not despise the day of salvation. All that are Maligners, and Reproachers, and Persecu∣ters of Godliness, and of such as live godly, take heed what ye do, it will be hard for you to kick against the Pricks; You make your selves the Butt of the Lord's fury, and his flaming indignation, if ye do not
cease from and repent of all your ungodly deeds. All that are Neutral, and Indifferent, and Lukewarm Professors, be zealous and repent; lest the Lord spew you out of His mouth. You that lament after the Lord, and mourn for all the abominations that are done in this City, and in the Land, and take pleasure in the stones and dust of Zin, cast not away your con∣fidence, but be comforted and encouraged in the Lord. He will yet appear to your joy, God hath not cast away his People nor work in Brittain and Ireland: I hope it shall once more Revive by the Power of His Spirit, and take root downward and bear fruit upward. There is yet a Holy Seed and precious Remnant, whom God will preserve and bring forth: but how Long or Dark, our Night may be, I do not know; the Lord shorten it for the sake of his Chosen. In the mean while, be ye patient & stedfast, immoveable, alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord, & in love one to another: Beware of Snares which are strawed thick: Cleave to the Covenant & Work of Reforma∣tion: Do not decline the Cross of Jesus Christ; choose rather to suffer Affliction with the People of God, then to enjoy the pleasurs of sin for a season; and ac∣count the Reproach of Christ greater riches then all the Treasure of the World. Let my Death grieve none of you, it will be more profitable and advantageous both for me, and for you, and for the Church of God, and for Christs interest and honor, then my life could have been. I forgive all men the guilt of it, and I desire you to do so also: Pray for them that perse∣cute you, and bless them that curse you, bless I say, and curse not. I die in the Faith of the Apostles and Primitive Christians, & Protestant Reformed Church∣es, particularly of the Church of Scotland, where∣of
I am a member and Minister. I bear my witness and Testimony to the Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government of the Church of Scotland, by Kirk-Sessions, Presbyteries, Synods and Generall Assem∣blies. Popery and Prelacy, and all the trumpery of Service and Ceremonies that wait upon them, I do abhor. I do bear my witness unto the National Co∣vanant of Scotland, and Solemn League and Covenant betwixt the three Kingdoms of Scotland, England and Ireland: These Sacred, Solemn, Publick Oaths of God, I believe can be loosed nor dispensed with, by no Person, or Party, or Power upon earth: but are still binding upon these Kingdoms, and will be for ever hereafter; and are ratifyed and sealed by the con∣version of many thousand souls, since our entering thereinto. I bear my witness to the Protestation against the controverted Assemblies and the Publick Reso∣lutions; to the Testimonies given against the Secta∣ries; against the course of Backsliding and Defection that is now on foot in the Land, and all the branches and parts thereof, under whatsoever name or notion, or acted by whatsoever party or person. And in the last place, I bear my witness to the cross of Jesus Christ; and that I never had cause nor have cause this day, to repent because of any thing I have suffered, or can now suffer for His Name: I take God to record upon my soul, I would not exchange this scaffold, with the Palace or Mitre of the greatest prelate in Brit∣tain. Blessed be God, who hath shewed mercy to such a wretch, and hath revealed His Son in me, and made me a Minister of the Everlasting Gospel, and that He hath daigned in the midst of much contradicti∣on from Sathan and the World, to seal my Ministry upon the hearts of not a few of His People, and espe∣cially
in the station wherein I was last, I mean the Congregation, and Presbytery of Sterlin. God for∣give the poor empty Man, that did there intrude upon my labors, and hath made a prey of many poor souls, and exposed others to reproach, and oppression, and a famine of the Word of the Lord. God forgive the misleaders of that part of the poor people, who tempt∣ed them to reject their own Pastor, and to admit of Intruders; and the Father of mercies, pity that poor Misled people: And the Lord visit the Congre∣gation and Presbytery of Sterlin once more with faithful Pastors; and grant that the Work and People of God may be revived thorow all Britain, and over all the World. Jesus Christ is my Light, and my Life, my Righteousness, my Strength and my Salva∣tion: He is all my Salvation, and all my Desire. Him, O Him I do with all the strength of my soul commend unto you. Blessed are they that are not offended in Him: Blessed are they that Trust in Him. Bless Him, O my soul, from henceforth even for ever. Rejoyce, rejoice all ye that love Him; be patient and rejoice in tribulation: Blessed are you, and blessed shall you be for ever and ever. Ever∣lasting Righteousness and Eternal Salvation is yours: All are yours, and ye are Christs, and Christ is Gods. Remember me O Lord with the favour thow bearest to thy People; O visit me with thy Salvation, that I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy Nation, that I may glory with thy Inheritance. Now let thy servant depart in peace since mine eyes have seen thy salvation. JA. GUTRHIE.
The last Speech and Testimony of the LORD WARIST0N, At his Death in Edinburgh, July 22. 1663. Right Honourable, much honoured, and beloved Auditors and Spectators. THat which I intended and prepared to have spoken at this time & in this condition, immediatly be∣fore my death (if it should be so ordered that it should be my lot) is not at present in my power, having been taken from me: But I hope the Lord shall preserve it to bear my Testimony more fully and clearly, then now I can in this condition, having my Memory much de∣stroyed, through much sore and long Sickness, Melan∣choly, and excessive drawing of my Blood. Though I bless the Lord my God, that notwithstanding of the forementioned distempers, I am in some capacity to leave this short and weak Testimony. I desire in the first place to confess my Sins, so far as is proper to this Place and Case, and to acknowledge Gods Mercies; and to express my Repentance of the one, and my Faith of the other, through the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ our gracious Redeemer and Mediator: I confess that my Natural Temper (or rather distemper) hath been Hasty and Passionat; and that in my Manner of going about and prosecuting of the best pieces of work and service to the Lord and to my Generation, I have been subject to my excesses of Heat, and thereby to some Precipitations; which hath no doubt offended standers by and lookers on, and
hath exposed both Me and the Work to their mistakes, whereby the beauty of that Work hath been obscured: Neither have I in following of the Lord's work, His Good Work, been without my own Self-seeking; which hath severall wayes vented is self to the offence of both God and Man, and to the grief thereafter of my own Conscience, and which hath often made me groan, and cry out with the Apostle, O miserable man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death? And to ly low in the dust mourning and lamenting over the same, deprecating God's wrath, and begging His tender Mercies to Pardon, and His powerful Grace to cure all these evils. I must withal confess, that it doth not a litle trouble me, and ly heavy upon my spirit, and will bring me down with sorrow to the grave (though I was not alone in this Offence, but had the body of the Nation going before me, and the Example of persons of all Ranks to insnare me) That I suffered my self through the power of temptations, and the too much fear anent the straits that my nume∣rous Family might be brought into, to be carried unto so great a length of Complyance in England with the late Usurpers, which did much grieve the hearts of the Godly, and made these that sought God ashamed and confounded for my sake, and did give no small occasion to the Adversary to reproach and blaspheme, and did withall not a litle obscure and darken the beau∣ty of severall former Actings about His blessed and glorious Work of Reformation, happily begun and far advanced in these Lands, wherein He was graci∣ously pleased to Employ, and by Employing to Ho∣nour me to be an Instrument (though the least and un∣worthiest of many) whereof I am not ashamed this day, but account it my Glory, how ever that Work
be now cried down, opposed, laid in the dust and trod upon: And my turning aside to comply with these men, was the more aggravated in my person, that I had so frequently and seriously made profession of my Aversness from and Abhorrence of that way, and had shown much Dissatisfaction with these that had not gone so great a length; for which as I seek God's mercy in Christ Jesus, so I desire that all the Lord's People, from my example may be more stirred up to watch and pray, that they enter not into temptation. 2. I do not deny on the other hand, but must: Testi∣fy in the second place, to the Glory of His Free-grace, that the Lord my God hath often shewed and engraven upon my Conscience, the Testimony of His Reconcil∣ing and Reconciled Mercy through the Merits of Jesus Christ, pardoning all my iniquities, and assuring me that He would deliver me also by the graces of His Holy Spirit, from the spait, tyranny and dominion thereof; And hath often drawn out my spirit to the exercise of Repentance and Faith, and after engraven upon my heart in legible characters His merciful par∣don, and gracious begun cure thereof to be perfected thereafter, to the Glory of His Name, the Salva∣tion of my Soul, and Edification of His Church. 3. I am pressed in conscience to leave here at my death, my true & honest Testimony in the sight of God and Man, to and for the Nationall Covenant: the So∣lemn League & Covenant; the Solemn Acknowledge∣ment of our Sins, & Engagement to our duties; to all the grounds & Causes of Fasts and humiliations, & of the Lords displeasure & contending with the Land; And to the several Testimonies given to His Interests, by Generall Assemblies, Commissioners of the Kirk,
Presbyteries, and by other honest and faithful Mini∣sters and Professors. 4. I am pressed also to encourage His Doing, Suf∣fering; Witnessing People, and Sympathizing ones with these that suffer, that they would continue in the duties of Mourning, Praying, Witnessing and Sym∣parthizing with these that suffer; and humbly to assure them in the Name of the Lord our God, the God of His own Word and Work, of His own Cause, Co∣venant and People, that He will be Seen, Found and Felt (in His own gracious Way and Time, by His own Means & Instruments, for His own Glory & Honor) to return to His own Truths and Interests and Ser∣vants, and revive His Name, His Covenant, His Word, His Work, His Sanctuary and His Saints in these Nations, even in the three Covenanted Nations, which were by so Solemn Bonds, Covenants, Sub∣scriptions and Oaths, given away and devoted unto Himself. 5. I exhort all these that have been, or are Enemies or unfreinds to the Lord's Name, Covenant or Cause, Word, Work or People, in Britain and Ireland, to Repent and Amend, before these sad judgements that are posting fast come upon them, for their sinning so highly against the Lord, because of any temptation of the Time on the right or left hand, by Baits or Straits whatsoever, and that after so many Pro∣fessions and Engagements to the contrary. 6. I dare not conceal from yow that are Friendly to all the Lord's Interests, that the Lord (to the com∣mendation of His Grace, be it humbly spoken) hath severall times, in the exercise of my Repentance and Faith during my trouble, and after groans and tears upon these three notable chapters, to wit, the 9 of
Ezra, the 9 of Nehemiah, and the 9 of Daniel, with other such sutable Scriptures, and in the very nick of fervent and humble Supplication to Him, for the Re∣viving again of His Name, Cause, Covenant, Word, and Work of Reformation in these Covenanted Nati∣ons, and particularly in poor Scotland, which first solemnly engaged to Him, to the good Example and Encouragement of His People in the other two Na∣tions to do the same also, That the Lord, I say, hath several times given to me good ground of hope and lively expectations of His Mercifull, Gracious, Powerful and Wonderful Renewing and Reviving again of His fore-mentioned great Interests in these Covenanted Nations: And that in such a Way, by such Means and Instruments, with such Antecedents, Concurrents, Consequents, and Effects, as shall wonderfully rejoyce His Mourning Friends, and astonish His Contradicting and counter-acting Ene∣mies. 7. I do earnestly recommend my poor Wife and Children and  posterity, to the choicest Bless∣ings of God, an o the Prayers and Favour of all the Lord's Children an Servants, in their earnest dealing with God and Men n their behalf, That they may not be ruined for y Cause, but for the Lord my God's sake, they  be favoured, assisted, supplyed and comforted,  so may be fitted by the Lord for His Fellowship and Service; whom God Himself hath moved me often, in their own Presence, and. with their own Consent, to dedicate, devote and resign alike and as well, as I devote and resign my own Soul and Body to Him for all Time and Eter∣nity.
8. I beg the Lord to open the eyes of all the Instru∣ments of my Trouble, that are not deadly Irreconcile∣able Enemies to Himself and His People, that they may see the wrong done by them to His Interests and People, and to Me and Mine, and may repent there∣of and return to the Lord, and may more cordially own and adhere to all His Interests in time coming: The good Lord give unto them Repentance, Remis∣sion and Amendement; and that is the worst wish I wish them, and the best wish I can wish unto them. 9. I do earnestly beg the fervent prayers of all His Praying People, Servants and Instruments, whether absent or present wherever they be, in behalf of His Name, Cause and Covenant, Work and People; and in behalf of my Wife, Children and their Posterity: And that the Lord would glorify Himself, edify His Church, encourage His Saints, further His Work, accomplish His good Word, by all His Doings and Dealings, in Substance and Circumstance toward all His own. 10. Whereas I have heard that some of my unfreinds have slandered and defamed my Name, as if I had been accessary to his late Majestie's death, and to the mak∣ing of the Change of the Government thereupon; the great God of Heaven be witness and Judge between Me and my Accusers in this; for I am free (as I shall now answer before his Tribunal) from any Accession by Counsel or Contrivance, or any other way to his late Majestie's death, or to their making that change of Government: And I pray the Lord to preserve our present King his Majesty, and to pour out His best blessings upon his royall Posterity, and to give unto them good and faithfull Counsellors, holy and wise
Counsels and prosperous successes, to God's Glory and to the good and interest of His people, and to Their own Honour and Happiness. 11. I do here now submit and commit my Soul and Body, Wife and Children and Childrens Children from generation to generation for ever, with all others his Friends and Followers, all His Doing and Suffering, Witnessing and Sympathizing ones, in the present and subsequent Generations, unto the Lord's choice Mercies, Graces, Favours, Services, Em∣ployments, Impowerments, Enjoyments, Improve∣ments and Inheritments, on Earth and in Heaven, in Time and Eternity. All which suits with all others, which He hath at any time by His Spirit moved and assisted me to make and put up, according to His will, I leave before and upon the Father's Mercifull Bowels, and the Son's Mediating Merits, and the Holy Spi∣rit's Compassionate Groans, for now and evermore. Amen. The Joint Testimony of these who died together in Edinburgh, Dec, 7. 1666. subscribed by them in prison, the same day of their death. Men and Brethren. THis is a great and important work, both for us who are now to render up our spirits to Him that gave them; And for yow who are not a litle concerned in the Cause, and in our blood by justifying or con∣demning our sentence: And therefore, as we speak
to yow as Dying men, who dare not dissemble with God or man, nor flatter our selves; So ye should not be idle, curious, or unconcerned Spectators. We are condemned by men, and esteemed by many as Rebels against the King (whose Authority we ac∣knowledge) But this is our rejoycing, the testimony of our conscience, that we suffer not as Evill doers, but for Righteousness, for the Word of God, and Testimony of Jesus Christ; And particularly for our renewing the Covenant, and in pursuance thereof, for Preserving and Defending of our selves by Armes, against the Usurpation and insupportable Tyranny of the Prelats; And against the most unchristian and inhumane Oppression and Persecution, that ever was enjoyned and practised by just Rulers, upon Free, In∣nocent and Peaceable Subjects. The Covenant and Cause being so just in themselves, and the duties of Self-preservation and mutual Defence in maintenance thereof, being to Judicious and un∣byassed men so clear, we need to say the less for vin∣dication of our Practice: Only, the Lawes establish∣ing Prelacy, and the Acts, Orders and Proclamations made for Complyance therewith, being executed against us by Military Force and Violence; And we with others, for our simple Forbearance, being Fin∣ed, Confined, Imprisoned, Exiled, Scourged, Stigmatized, Beaten, Bound as beasts, and Driven unto the mountains for our lives; And thereby hun∣dreds of Families being beggared, several Parishes and some whole Country-sides exceedingly impove∣rished; And all this, either Arbitrarily and without any Law, or respect had to guilt or innocency; Or Unjustly contrary to all Conscience, Justice and Rea∣son, though under the Pretence of iniquous Laws;
and without regard had to the penalty specifyed in the Law: And all Remonstrating of Grievances (were they never so just and many) and Petitions for Redress, being restrained by Laws condemning all former Remonstrances and Petitions in the like cases; There was no other remedy left to us, but that last of neces∣sary Self-preservation and Defence. And this being one of the greatest Principles of Nature, warranted by the Law or God, Scriptural Instances, and the consent and Practices of all Reformed Churches and Christian States abroad, and of our own famous Predecessors at home, It cannot in reason or Justice, be reputed a Crime, nor condemned as Rebellion by any humane Authority. Though we be not the first that have suffered for the Cause or God within the Land, yet we are among the first that have been Legally condemned and put to Death Expresly for taking the Covenant: And we are so far from being ashamed thereof, that we account it our honour to be reckoned worthy to suffer for such a Cause; And cannot but bless the Lord, that we have such a cloud of Witnesses, in this and other Reformed Churches, going before us in the same duty for Sub∣stance, and in Suffering therefore. We cannot but regret (if we could with tears o blood) the Nationall and Authorized Backsliding of the Land, by Perjury and breach of Covenant; The overturning of the Work of Reformation; The great Desolation of the House of the Lord, by smiting of the Shepherds and scattering of the Flocks; The In∣trusion of so many mercenary Hirelings into the Mini∣stry, who because of Apostacy, Perjury, Ignorance and Profanness, can neither be acknowledged as God's mouth to the People in Preaching, nor employed as their mouth to Him in Prayer; The abounding of
Popery, Superstition, and Profanness by unheard-of Oaths, Blasphemies, Uncleannesss and Drinking, even in some whose Office and Place requireth them to be more Examplary; And the shedding of the Blood of the Saints by the rage of Persecution: And therefore we cannot but disown all these abominable Laws, Courses & Practices, & declare our abhorrence of the same, & dissent therefrom; Protesting before An∣gels and Men, that we be not interpreted as consent∣ers thereto, and beseeching the Hearer of prayer, that we be not involved in the guilt thereof, nor par∣take of the plagues which follow thereupon. As this Land was happy above all Nations, for the purity and plenty of the Gospel, and for a Form of Church Government more conform to the Patern in the Scriptures, then in others of the Reformed Churches; So we acknowledge His great goodness to us in speciall, that gave us our lines in such pleasant places: For we have such full perswasion of the Truth of the Reformed Religion in the Church of Scotland, And have felt so much of the Power and Sweetness thereof, that we do here declare our firm belief and perswasion of, and adherence to the same, in Doc∣trine, Worship, Discipline and Government, accord∣ing to the Nationall Covenant, the Solemn League and Covenant, the Confession of Faith, Catechisms, Directory of worship, and Propositions for Govern∣ment; Accounting it our honor and happiness to have been born in it, to have lived in Communion with it, and now to die (through Grace) Members, Witnesses and Asserters thereof. And further as Christians and as Members of the same Church and Common-wealth; in the Fear and
zeal of our God, in Love to our Brethren, in desire of the Perservation of Church and Kingdom, and for our own Exoneration, now when we take our leave of the World, We do seriously and in the bowels of Christ, Supplicate, Warn, Exhort and Obtest yow all the Inhabitants of the Kingdom, from the King to, the meanest of the Subjects, according to your old Principles, Professions, Promises, Declarations, Oaths and Covenants, faithfully to Own, Maintain, preserve and Defend the said Religion; And after the example of our Noble and Renowned Ancestors to quit your selves like Men & Christians, in endeavour∣ing by all just Means, according to your Places and Powers, to shake off this heavy yoke of PRELACY, which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear, & which is Destructive to all our true Interests, Religi∣ous and Civill; As ye would not involve your selves in the guilt and plagues of Perjury and Breach of Co∣venant; And as you tender the good of your own Names, Persons, Estates, Families and Liberties, as well as of your immortal Souls; And as ye would par∣take of the good of God's chosen, and of our joyes, when ye come so near Eternity as we are. We shall say no more, but as we were not afraid to take our lives in our hands, so we are not afraid to lay them down in this Cause; And as we are not ashamed of Christ because of His cross, so we would not have you offended in Christ nor discouraged because of us: For we bear you record, that we would not exchange lots with our Adversaries; nor redeem our Lives, Liberties and Fortunes, at the price of Perjury and breach of Covenant. And further we are assured, though this be the da of Iacob's trouble, that yet the Lord, when He hath
accomplished the Triall of His own, and filled up the cup of His Adversaries, He will awake for judge∣ment, plead His own Cause, avenge the quarrel of His Covenant, make inquiry for blood, vindicate His People, break the arm of the wicked, and esta∣blish the just; For to Him belongeth judgement and vengeance: And though our eyes shall not see it, yet we believe that the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing under His wings; & that He will revive His Work, repair the breaches, build the old wastes, and raise up the desolations; Yea the Lord will judge His people, & repent Himself for His servants, when their power is gone, and there is none shut up or left: And therefore, Rejoyce, O ye Nations, with His People: For He will avenge the blood of His servants, and will render vengeance to His adversaries, and He will be merciful to His Land and People. So let thy Enemies perish O Lord; but let them that love Him, be as the Sun when He goeth forth in His might. Sic subscribitur. Iohn MeCulloch of Barholm. And. Arnot. Iohn Gordon of Knockbrex.

Another Testimony which was▪ also left by such of the Former ten Persons, as were in the same Chamber with Thomas Paterson Merchant in Glasgow; who, being in like manner Indited but dying of his Wounds before Sentence, did communicate the same to his friends, with his Assent thereunto. MEn and Brethren, being condemned by our Rul∣ers as Traitors, lest we should seem to many to suffer as evill doers, In the first place, we bless and praise the Lord our God, who hath made us (the un∣worthiest of all men) Worthy to be faithfull to Him, who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and in sim∣plicity and godly Sincerity, singly to mind his glory; and who also maketh the cross of Christ (though by men superscribed with Treason) our sweet consola∣tion, and his own joy our strength. 2. We declare in the presence of the same God, be∣fore whom we are now ready to appear, that we did not intend to Rebell against the King and his just Authority, Whom as we acknowledg for our Lawful Soveraign; so we do earnestly pray in his behalf, that God would open his eyes and Convert his heart, that he may remember his Vowes made unto God, relieve this oppressed Kirk, and long reign and flourish in righteousness. 3. We declare, that perceaving the Holy Cove∣nants of our God broken, the Work of the Lord over∣turned, the Gospel and Kingdome of Jesus Christ
despised and trampled upon, his pure Ordinances cor∣rupted, his faithful and our soul-refreshing Ministers cast out, and the Land filled with Perjury and Profa∣nity, and like to be hurried back to that gulf of Igno∣rance, Superstition and Confusion, whence the Lord did so gloriously deliver us; And finding our selves not only Spoiled of our most precious blessings, and most dear enjoyments, but urged and compelled by cruel Violence and Barbarous Persecution to wick∣ed Apostacy from our Holy Covenants, and to Re∣bellion against our God; And all this done by no other hand then the wicked and perjured Prelats; And for no other ends (whatever they may pretend) then the satisfying of their own vile lusts, and establishing their so often abjured Antichristian Tyranny, over both Souls and Bodies of Men; And lastly finding former Petitions condemned as Seditious, and our private complaints (when but muttered) insolently rejected, We did in the fear and Zeal of our God, and by the warrant of his Holy Word, according to the first and most Innocent instinct of pure Nature, and the Prac∣tice of all People and Persons in the like case; And after the Example of all the oppressed Kirks of Jesus Christ, and of our Noble Ancestors, take the Sword of Ne∣cessary Self-defence, from the rage and fury of these wicked & violent Men▪ until we might make our heavy Grievances known to his Majesty, and obtain from his Justice a satisfying remedy. We will not now mention our particular Sufferings, nor the sighes and groans of poor wasted Galloway, which though very heavy from the hand of man, are all to light for Jesus Christ; Nor are we willing to re∣flect upon these grievous and bitter Lawes and E∣dicts, by which they seem to be warranted: Only
we know that God is Righteous, whose Lawes and judgments are Superior and above all the Lawes and Actions of men. And to him who will judge righte∣ously, We intirly Commit our Cause, which is none other, then the Reviving of the Work of God and Renewing of his Covenant: Which though it pleased the Holy and Wise God, not to favour with Suc∣cess in the field, and though by men it be made our Condemnation, yet it is our Righteousness) Innocen∣cy and Confidence in his sight. And all praise and thanks be unto our God, who not only kept us sted∣fast in his Covenant, and made us Willing and Ready to adventure our Lives for His Name; but hath also ac∣cepted and dignifyed our Offer, with this publick Appearance: Where, in his own glorious presence before whom we shall instantly appear, and before our often Sworn and once Zealous and tender Brethren in the same Cause, and in midst of Thee O Edinburgh, once famous for the Glory and Zeal of God and of this Covenant, we may give and Seal this our Testimony with our blood. We therefore the unworthiest of all the Faithful, do in the Spirit of God and Glory, Testify and Seal with our Blood and Lives, that both the National Covenant and Solemne League and Covenant are in Themselves Ho∣ly, Just, and True, and perpetually Binding, con∣taining no other thing, then our Indispensable Obli∣gations to all Duties of Religion and Righteousness, according to the revealed Will of God, which no Authority nor Power of Man, is or ever shall be able to disannul; And that our blessed Reformations both from Popery and Prelacy, and all that was done or ensued, in the sincere and upright prosecution thereof, was and is the Work of God, which though Men
fight against, yet shall they never be able to prevail: And as this is our Faith, so it is our Hope to all that wait for the Salvation of God, that Our God will surely appear for his own Glory, and vindicate his Cause and persecuted People, and render vengeance to his Adversaries even the vengeance of his Holy Temple and broken Covenent. O be not then moved with our Sufferings with are but Light and Momen∣tany, for they Work for us a far more, execeding and Eternal weight of Glory, and for you also a strong Confirmation and abounding Consolation, against the like trial that possibly may befal you. O then save your selves from this Wicked and Apostat Genera∣tion, and be ye stedfast, unmoveable, alwayes a∣bounding in the Work and Cause of the Lord; Wait∣ing for the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, which in his Times he shall shew, who only hath Immorta∣lity, dwelling in the Light which no man can ap∣proach, whom no man hath seen, or can see, to whom be honour and Power everlasting. AMEN. The Testimony of CAPT. ANDREW ARNOT, one of the former ten who died. Decem. 7. DEar Friends and Spectators, I am brought by the good providence of God to this publick place of execution (which is no dishonour) for points of Treason, as is alleadged; but God knoweth (who
knoweth the secrets of hearts) whether in Rebellion or not, I cam forth: He is my witness & wil be my Judge. And whoever they be that any way have been in∣strumentall or incensed against me to procure this Sen∣tence against me, God forgive them, & I forgive them. I am not now purposed to disput the matter of my be∣ing in company with these worthy Christians who are now defeat and broken, their blood shed, and they despitfully mocked by many: I acknowledge and declare that I was with them. As to the cause of my being with them, whither in Rebellion or not God knoweth, and all Israel shall know. And for me, I say the Cause is the Lords, who made the Heaven and the Earth, though now it be hated. And I desire to bear witness (with the rest of the worthy witnesses, who are gone before and are now staged) to that glo∣rious Work of Reformation in Britain and Ireland, and to Gospel-Ordinances in their Purity, as they have been taught and administrated these 30 Years last by past, And I adhere to the Presbyterial way of Doctrin, Worship, Discipline, and Government, by General Assemblies, Synods, Presbyteries, and Sessions, according to the Patern of the holy Scriptures (Jesus Christ himself being the head Corner-stone) the Con∣fession of faith, Cathechismes Shorter and Larger, Directory for Worship, National Covenant, Solemne League & Covenant, & every Paper tending to the good of the true Religion. And this I think fit to Testify & Declare under my hand (not knowing if I shall have any Liberty to speak,) & intend, God willing, to Seal with my Blood shortly. I confess that unexpectedly I am come to this place, (though some times I have had some small thoughts of it) And I do account my self highly honoured to be reckoned amongst the wit∣nesses
of Jesus Christ, to suffer for his Name, Truth and Cause; and this day I esteem it my Glory, Garland, Crown & royall dignity to fill up a part of His sufferings. And now I take my leave of you all my dear and worthy Friends and acquaintances. The Blessings of the Eternall God be multiplied upon yow and your seed, and upon all the suffering Friends of Christ this day; upon my dear and loving Wife, who hath been a faithful sympathizer with me, and upon my dear Children. The work of God is now at under, but Christ shall carry the Day: Blessed is he that believeth and seeth not, for there shall be a perform∣ance. Now the Eternall God, who brought again the Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, the great sheep∣herd of the flock, strengthen and establish you and all the Lord's people. So pray ye and so prayeth your Friend. ANDREW ARNOT. The Testimony of JOHN SHIELDS, Yeoman one of the former ten who died at Edinburgh the 7 day of Decemb. 1666. I Am a man unlearned and not accustomed to speak in publick, yet being now called to witness and suf∣fer for the Lord in publick, I cannot be altogether si∣lent of that which Religion and Reason hath taught me anent the cause of my suffering. I bless the Lord, I suffer not as an evil doer, espe∣cially not for any Rebellion against his Majesties
lawful Authority; I attest him who is the searcher of hearts, that was never my intention in the least, and it is as litle the nature and intention of what I have done; But for renewing of the Covenant with the Lord, and following the ends thereof, as to the sup∣pressing of abjured Prelats, and Intruders upon the Lords flock, and the restoring of the Government of the House of God by Presbyteries as He himself hath appointed in his Word, with a faithful, Godly, Called, and Sent Ministery; And together with pure Ordinances, the Power of Godliness. For this I am condemned and to suffer this day. This I acknow∣ledged freely before our Judges; This I still acknow∣ledg, and am persuaded that herein I witness a faith∣ful Confession. This Cause and Covenant I com∣mend to all the Lord's People. It is not free for you to forsake if; You are inviolably ingaged in it; It is not safe to desert it, because of the Curse of the per∣jurer and false swearer. There is unspeakable blessedness in the pursuance of it, whereof I can bear witness to the Lord by my rich Experience, since we began to Do and Suffer at this time for him: Whereupon I cheer∣fully lay doun my Life for this his Cause; He it is who Justifieth it, what man or Authority under heaven can condemn it? Arise O Lord, let not man prevaill against Thee; plead and Iudg this Cause which is thine own, for thine own names sake.
The Testimony of another of the former ten Persons left subscribed with a Friend. I designed no Rebellion against lawful Authority, but the suppressing of Prelacy and of Profanity; and advancing of Holiness in Gods World: In a Word, I adhere to all the Articles of the good Covenant, and did intend the restoring of our good and Soul-refresh∣ing Ministers, and the casting out of the dumb greedy Dogs that cannot bark. In this Cause I was a free Vo∣luntier pressed by none, thinking it my duty to appear for helping the Lord against the Mighty. This I tes∣tify under my hand from the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, the 6 of December, 1666. The Testimony of MR ALEXANDER ROBERTSON, Preacher of the Gospel, and Proba∣tioner for the Ministry, who died at Edin∣burgh, Decemb. 14. 1666. FEaring that after the example of others, I should not be permitted to speak openly to the People, I thought fit (beside my adherence to what my brethren, who have gone before me, left behind them concern∣ing our common Cause) to leave a word in writ for satisfaction of them who survive me. That, for preservation & defence of the true Religion of this Church, and for the relief of my poor brethren afflicted & persecuted therefore, I joyned with others in Armes, & that I renewed the Covenant, that all men
might the better know my Cause and Principles, I am so far from denying or being ashamed of, that I both acknowledge and avow it as my duty; But let no man that will not condemn himself upon the same common obligations to do what I did, account me a Rebell therefore, because with the same breath that I did swear, and with that same hand that I did subscribe to preserve and defend Religion, I did also swear to defend the King and his Authority. Our Church was not more glorious in her self & ter∣rible to her Adversaries, while we enjoyed pure Ordi∣nances of Word and Sacraments, and her beautiful As∣semblies for Government and Discipline, of the Lords own Institution, then she became of late de∣formed by the Usurpation and Tyranny of Prelacy; And I do solemnly declare as a dying man, who dare not dissemble, that as I thought and still averre that the erecting of this abjured Prelacy is the cause of much of the Sin in the Land, and of all the suffer∣ings of the Lords People therein: so I had no worse design, then the restoring of the Work of Re∣formation according to the Covenant, and more particularly the extirpation of Prelacy, to which his Ma: and all the Subjects are as, much obliged as I. And let that be removed and the Work of Reforma∣tion restored, and I dar die in saying, that his Ma: shall not have in all his Dominions, more loving, loyall, peaceable and faithfull Subjects, then these who for their non-complyance are loaded with the reproaches of Phanaticisme and Rebellion. The sufferings and insupportable oppression of these that could not because of the Command and Oath of God, acknowledge & comply with Prelacy, may seem light to some in whom the spirit of the old enmity
that is betwixt the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent remaineth, and to others (perhaps their Friends) who look thereupon at adistance; but as there is just reason to think that if these rigid oppressions had been made known to his Ma: his justice and clemency would have provided a remedy, and as the half there∣of would have made the Prelats, their patrons and adherents impatiently mad, for as loyal as they pre∣tend to be; So in the like cases of irresistible necessity, when there is little open door for representing of griev∣ances and desires, and less hope of relief thereby, I suppose it will not be found condemned by the Con∣fessions of Reformed Churches, or doctrine of sound Divines, but that it is authorized by the light and law of Nature, by uncondemned examples in the Holy Scripture, and by the practice of all Christian States, by Armes to preserve and defend men Lives, their Religion, Liberties and Fortunes; And especially, where they are not seeking to acquire a new Religion or new Liberties, but only to preserve their old or re∣cover them, when they are violently & unjustly spoiled of the same, as in our case; Otherwise we should sin against the generation of the just, and condemn, as rebellious, the most of the through Reformations of the Reformed Churches abroad, and of our own at home. If this course was lawfull, and if it was our duty to joyn therein, as I believe and lay down my life in the perswasion that it was; and if all the Kingdom was (as they are) bound by Covenant to assist and defend one another in the ommon Cause of Religion and Li∣berty, whatever may be said of these that came not forth to help the Lord against the mighty, it cannot but be their dreadful sin, who joyned themselves in Armes,
or took Oaths to oppose, suppress and break it, seing they have sided themselves against the Lord and his Work, and their carriage is a much higher degree of Accession to the blood that is shed, then Paul's keep∣ing of the clothes of them that stoned Stephen to death; And I wish that they may lay the matter to heart and repent of it, that God may forgive them, as I forgive all men, and particularly Moron who did apprehend me. I know that there is a holy seed in the Land, who shall be the substance thereof, and I pray that the Lord may make them more zealous and valiant for the truth upon earth; I know also that there are many, whose bowells of compassion have been drawn forth toward these who took their lives in their hands, by Prayers to God for them and Charity to them, and especial∣ly in Edinburgh toward the poor Prisoners (of whom I may not only say, that what they have done deserv∣eth to be told for a Memorial wherever the Gospel is preached, but am assuredly confident, that besides the blessings of the poor and persecuted, the Lord is not unrighteous to forget their work and labor of love, which they have shewed towards his Name, in that they have ministred to the Saints & do minister) And yet I must needs regret, that so many in this City once famous and honoured for harmonious owning of the Cause and Covenant of God, and blessed above many other Cities with solemn Assemblies for Worship and Government, should have been ensnared into an Oath so contradictory to the Oath of the Covenant; & which was devised, contrived and imposed in lieu of the Declaration against the same. and for a Grave∣stone to suppress the revival of the Work of God with∣in this Land.
The Apostacy of this Land is very great by Perjury and breach of Covenant, and so much the worse and more aggreageble, that it is Authorized and very uni∣versal: And as I cannot but regret that so many are insnared therein, so I must needs warne all to abhorre and beware of all Declarations and Oaths contradic∣tory to the Covenant and renunciatory thereof, as they would not involve themselves in the guilt and plagues denounced against, and ordinarily inflicted up∣on Perjury and breach of Covenant; and so much the rather, because this is like to be the Shibboleth and tri∣all of the times. As for my self, I have seen and do find so much worth in Truth, which is to be bought at any rate but sold at none, And so much transcendent excel∣lency and amiableness in Christ, that not only with cheerfulness & confidence I lay down my life for Him and His Truth, committing my soul to Him to be kept in hope of a joyfull Resurrection of the body; but also bless Him that gave me a life to lose, and a body to lay down for Him; And although the Mer∣ket and price of Truth may appear to many ve∣ry high, yet I reckon it low, and all that I have or can do, little and too little for Him who gave Him∣self for me and to me; for I account all things but loss and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ MY LORD, for whom I now suffer the loss of all things, that I may win Him, and be found in Him, and that I may not only know the fellowship of His sufferings, but the power of His resurrection, and attain unto the resurrection of the dead. And as for yow, my dear Friends, as I pray
for you, that the God of all grace, who hath called us unto His eternall glory by Christ Jesus, after ye have suffered a while, may make yow perfect, sta∣blish, strengthen and settle yow; so I recommend to you the same truth, that you be not soon shaken in mind, but that ye hold fast the profession of your faith without wavering; And as you have receaved the Lord, so walk in Him; Warning and obtesting you by all manner of obligations, and by the hope and joy of that crown which I wait for, that ye keep your selves unspotted with the abominable courses and practices of these times, whereunto ye may be tempted by the extremity of suffering; and particu∣larly that ye beware of unlawfull Oaths and Declara∣tions against the Cause and Covenant of God, that ye have no complyance with, nor give consent unto this Prelacy, which ye have abjured; And that you be afraid and aware of Popery, which by Connivance doth so visibly abound and dayly increase; But by fighting the good fight and keeping of the faith, you may finish your course, as I do, in the assurance of the crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge, hath laid up and shall give un∣to me, and not to me only, but to all them that love His appearance. ALEXANDER ROBERTSON.
The Testimony of JOHN NILSON, of Corsack who died at Edinburgh. Dec. 14. 1666. BEing made a spectacle to the World, to Angels, and to Men, I found it necessary, for vindication of the Truth & of my self, for undeceaving of some, & en∣couraging of others, to leave this line behind me, which with my innocent blood may speak when I am gone. I am condemned (I shall not say how unjustly) as a Rebell against Man, but the Lord God of Gods He knoweth, & all Israel shall know that it is not for Rebellion against God, but for endeavouring to recover the blessed work of Reformation, and particularly for endeavouring to extirpate Prelacy, which hath been the cause of so much sin and suffering within this Land, and for renewing of the Covenant, from the obligation whereof (seing I made my Vow and Promise to the Lord) neither I my self, nor any humane Authority can absolve me. And if any account this Rebellion, I do plainly confess, that after the way which they call Heresy, I worship the God of my fathers. Although the insupportable oppression, under which I and many others did groan, were enough to justify our Preserving and Defending of our selves by Armes, yet know that the Cause was not Ours but the Lord's; for we suffered all our grievous Oppressions not for evill-doing, but because we could not in conscience acknowledge, comply with and obey Prelacy, and submit unto the Ministery of Ignorant,
Light and Profane men, who were irregularly and vio∣lently thurst upon us; Neither did we only or mainly designe our civil Liberties, but the Liberty of the Gospel, the Extirpation of Prelacy, the Restauration of our faithful Pastors, the Suppression of Profanity, Promoving of Piety, the saving of ourselves from un∣just violence, untill we had presented our Grievances and Desires; And in a word, the Recovering of the once glorious, but now ruined Work of Reformation, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government, according to the Nationall Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant, to which I declare my adhe∣rence, and through grace shall seal the same with my blood. My Advocate drew up a Supplication for me, wherein was acknowledged that I had been with the Rebels; but let none offend thereat: for  do hereby de∣clare, that I was so far from accounting that course Rebellion, that I judged and still do judge it was my duty to joyn therein, and my honor to suffer therefore; Otherwise, I should have counted my self accessary to the blood of the Lord's People which is shed? And cannot but regret that others of the Lord's Peo∣ple, when they heard of us, did not come forth with speed to help the Lord against the Mighty; much more let all mourn, that not only many have appear∣ed as Enemies, but also conjured themselves against the Lord, & the same Covenant which they so solemn∣ly sware; And as for the Petition it self, I knew not that expression was in it. Being conscious to my self of so much weakness, & so many hainous sins which predomine in me, & of unfruit∣fulness under the Gospel and unsutable walking there∣to, I confess my self the vilest of sinners, and desire
to mourn for the same, and pray that the Lord for Christ's sake may freely forgive me, as I have forgiven them that have wronged me, and hope through the righteousness of Jesus Christ to obtain the same; And I do exhort all and every one of my friends to more ho∣liness, Prayer and stedfastness, alwayes abounding in the Work of the Lord; And above all things, to detest & shun that wicked Declaration against the Covenant, the apparant temptation of the time, and the very mark of Antichristian Prelacy. All that I have is but little, but if I had many Worlds, I would lay them all down, as now I do my life for Christ and His Cause, nothing doubting but the Lord will abundantly provide for my Wife and my six Children, whom I commit to the Lord's care, and recommend to the Kindness and Prayers of the faithful; And do lay an express charge on my Wife that she shew all my Children, that I have bound them all to the Covenant, for which now I lay down my life, and that She lay it upon them as my last command, that they adhere to every Article thereof. The Work and People of God are brought very low: It may be, because they were not ripe for a de∣liverance; And for the greater triall, and filling up of the cup of the Adversaries; Or, because there was litle, or less prayer then should have been amongst these who appeared at this time, that the Lord hath made this late breach. But, dear Friends, be not therefore tempted to call in question the Work of Re∣formation; or to think the worse of Christ and His Cause, because of sufferings; Nor be discouraged be∣cause these few who took their lives in their hands, fell before the Adversary; For as sufferings are often sweetned by the Spirit of God and Glory that resteth
upon the sufferers, and afterward bring forth the peaceable fruits of righteousness unto them that are exercised thereby; So the Lord will arise in due time, and have mercy upon Zion, and plead the cause which is his own: And this Testimony, as I am this day to seal with my blood, so I subscribe with my hand. JOHN NILSON OF CORSACK. The Testimony of GEORGE CRAWFORD, Yeoman who died at Edinburgh, Decemb. 14. 1666 SEing I am to die after this manner, I lay before yow this Testimony, which I avow before God, and leave behind me to the World. That which moved me to come along with these men, was their persuasion, and my desire to help them (which with a safe conscience I could not well refuse) who, being tyrannically opprest by the Pre∣lats and their dependants and upholders, and seing no other way was left to be taken, took up Armes for their own defence; And if this be Rebellion, I leave it to the great God the supream Judge to decern: For in my weak judgement, I found it warrantable from the Word of God, and without prejudice of the King's Authority (whom I pray God to direct and guide in the right wayes of the Lord, and to make him prosper therein, so that he may be surely set in his Kingdom, having Him whom no enemy can resist to defend him)
seeing there was nothing intended by us, against his or any others just and lawful Authority. But that which was my principall and chief design, was giving my poor assistance to the rooting out of Prelats & Prelacy, and all such as are come into God's vine-yard without the Master's commission, these Hirelings who came not in at the true door, Iesus Christ, but have climbed up some other way as thieves and robbers, whose voice the sheep know not (All which is too sadly confirmed by the dreadfull and horrid sins that are risen in the Land, and the curses and plagues that have followed thereupon) that so by taking away these, the abuses which proceed from them, and the sad consequences which follow their standing falling with them, the Covenant of God might be re-established, and true Pastors that were silenced might be set at liberty, their mouths open∣ed, and they themselves put to the keeping of their flocks, and all other such persons, who were banished, or any other vvay under suffering, relieved. And I do adhere to the vvay of Church-Govern∣ment svvorn to in the Covenant, vvhich I think and assert to be conform to God's Word; vvhich, vvith His Spirit directing, is the only Patern and judge in all controversies: and hovvever our endeavours at this time have not been successful, it is of the Lord, vvho vvill come in his own time, for He can do as well with few as vvith many; but it is like the cup of the Adversaries is not full: And who knoweth, but the Lord God of hosts vvill hiss for the bee of Egypt and the fly of Assyria, vvho vvill be more cruel and blood-thirsty then vve vvere, to avenge the quarrel of His ovvn People, and to make vvay for the establish∣ing of His ovvn Cause. I say no more, but as I vvas
vvilling to hazard my life for this Cause, so I am ready to lay it down at my Master's feet, seing He calls for it: And I pray the Almighty, to send His Spirit of Consolation promised by His Son to His ovvn people, to strengthen them and bear them through, till the appointed time of the Lord's coming with Deli∣verance; for He will come for His own Cause, and for His peoples sake, and will not tarry. The last Speech and Testimony of MR HEW MC KAILE. Preacher of the Gospel and Probationer for the Ministry, at his death in Edinburgh, Decemb. 22. 1666. BEing by a great surprisal of Providence, thus stag∣ed before the World, in a matter of so universall concernment to all that fear God and desire to be sted∣fast in his Covenant, I could not forbear to leave be∣hind me this standing Testimony, concerning the Oc∣casion and Uses thereof, for the Glory of God, for the Vindication of my Profession from the aspersions cast thereon by Men, and the Edification of these by my death, to whom I had devoted my Life in the work of the Ministery. I have esteemed the Government of this Church by Presbytery, to be among the chief of the Ordinances of Jesus Christ, which by his blood he hes purchased, and ascended up on high to bestovv as a gift upon it; as being the very Gospell-Ministery in it's Simplicity and Purity from the Inventions of Men, and so the Mean
by which other Ordinances are administred, and the most fundamental Truths made effectual in the hearts of his People, and therefore that it ought with that same carefulness to be contended for. Experience both of the having and wanting of it, hath given it this Epistle of Commendation, so as it may be both known and read of all men: Which is also true of the solemne Engagements of the Nation thereto, by the Nationall Covenant, and Solemn League and Covenant, which I have esteemed in their Rise & Renewing, pregnant performances of that promise, Isaiah. 44.5. where it is evident, that where Church Reformations come to any maturity, they arrive at this degree of saying I am the Lords & subscribing with the hand unto the Lord. So was it in the dayes of the Reforming Kings of Iudah, and after the Restauration from the Captivity in the dayes of Nehe∣miah: This same promise did the Lord Jesus make Yea & Amen to us, when he redeemed us from spirituall Babilon, which is so much the greater evidence, that these were the very Motions of Gods Spirit in our first Reformers, that they were expressly designed against the greatest motions of the Spirit of Darkness in Antichrist and his supposts, and against the greatest confirmations that ever these Abominations attain∣ed by the decrees of the Council of Trent, and that bloody Bond called, the Holy League. And therefore whatever indignity is done unto these Covenants, I do esteeme to be no less then doing despite unto the spirit of Grace in his most eminent Exerting of himself; but especially Declaring against the same as flowing from a Spirit of Sedition and Rebellion, to be a Sin of the same nature with theirs, who ascribed Christ his casting out of Devils to Beelzebub; and that with this aggravation, that these Scribes and Pharisees came never
the length of prefessing Christ, and submiting them∣selves to Him and his wayes. Bu we are condemned to death upon the account of this Covenant, for adhereing to the dueties therein sworn to, by such as once did as much themselves as we have done, and some of them more then some of us: Which considerations have moved me to great feares of Gods wrath against the Land, according to the curse that we are bound under, if we should break that Co∣venant, & in the fear of it many times to pour out my soul before the Lord; & as soon as I heard of a Party up in Armes in behalf of the Covenant; (all other door be∣ing shut, whereby the redress of the manifest viola∣tions of it might be obtained, and these by manifest & unheard of violence obtruded upon others) to go along with them, being bound by that Covenant against detest∣able Indifferency and Neutrality in this matter, & to esteem every injury done to any ingaged in this Cove∣nant upon account of it, as done to my self: Very Con∣science of duty urged me to this against some reluctancy of fear of what might follow. Upon the same reasons at Lanrik, with the rest I declared my adherence to the Covenant, by my lifting up of my hand, after the Ar∣ticles thereof were read. And here I cannot but with greef of heart acknow∣ledg my fainting in a day of trial, that being ingaged with them upon such accounts, I many times in fear de∣signed to withdraw, and at length did, which as it was the occasion of my falling into the hands of the Enemy, so I think among other things it was the cause why God delivered me into their hands. Upon the same fear, in all my Examinations I have denied my ingage∣ment with them, and endeavoured to Vindicate my self by asserting the real designes I had to part from
them, and have utterly cast away the glory of a testi∣mony, which my very being in their company as a favourer of the ends of the Covenant, and as one will∣ing to contribute my best endeavours for the promov∣ing of them, but especially my declaring for the Co∣venant, did bear unto the Truth and Ordinances of Jesus Christ against this untoward Generation: This I confesse to be no less then a denying of Jesus Christ, and a being ashamed of his Words before men; but I hope the Lord who remembreth that we are but frail dust, shall not lay it to my charg, but according to his faithfulness and Grace will forgive me, who by this Publick Confession, take to my self shame and con∣fusion of face, and fly to the propitiation offered to all sinners in Jesus Christ. And these things as they have procured this death unto me, as an act of Gods Justice; so they mind me of other evils in mine own heart, that have been the source of this my unwill∣ingness to take on Christ's Cross: My heart hath not studied to maintaine that Spirituality in walking with God and Edifying Exemplariness with others, that became one that had receaved the first fruits of the Spirit and aimed at the Ministery of the Gospel, living in times of so much calamity for the Church of God, and particular afflictions as to my self. If I had spent my dayes in groaning after my house from Heaven, would I have shifted so fair an occasion of being cloathed with it? Alas that I have loved my Lord and Master Jesus Christ so litle! Alas that I have done so litle service to him, that I have so litle labour to follow Me to my Everlasting rest. This I speak to these especially, with whom I have familiarly convers∣ed in my Pilgrimage, that seing the Lord will not grant me Life to testify my real Reformation of these
things, my aknowledgement at Death may have in∣fluence upon them, to study not only Godliness but the Power of it. As I acknowledg that I have not been free and in∣genuous in these particulars formentioned, so in other things, wherein I interponed that Holy name of God, as to the not being upon the Contrivance of this riseing in Armes, nor privy to any resolution thereanent, nor conscious of any Intelligence at home or abroad con∣cerning it, I was most ingenuous: And they have wronged me much, who said that I denied upon Oath, that which they were able to make out against me, or knew to be truth; But non alleage Perjury against me, but such as are so manifestly guilty of it before the World, that their tougnes in such alleagances are no slander. Although I be Judged and condemned as a Rebell amongst Men, Yet I hope even in order to this Action to be accepted as Loyal before God. Nay there can be no greater act of Loyalty to the King, as the times now go, then for every man to do his utmost for the Exstirpation of that abominable plant of Prelacy, which is the bane of the Throne and of the Countrey: which if it be not done, the Throne shall never be established in Righteousness, until these wicked be removed from before it. Sure I ame these who are now comdemned as Rebels against Him by them, are such as have spent much time in prayer for Him, and do more sincerely wish his standing, and have endea∣voured it more by this late action so much condemned, then the Prelates by condemning them to death. This Disaster hath heightened greatly the Afflictions of our Chuch, and ought to teach all of you to drink the Wine of Astonishment: Ye have not known tribulation till now: Now we Judg them happy that
are fallen asleep and removed far away, and know that God hath been taking away his Servants from the Evils that were to come. Know that God's designe is to make many hearts contrite, that have been for∣merly too whole, and have not lamented sufficient∣ly the removeall of his Ordinances and Ministery, and the reproach rubed upon the Work of Reforma∣tion. Beware that your sorrow be not a momentany motion of commoun Compassion, that evanisheth when it may be there is some intermission in this vio∣lent course of sheding innocent blood: Labour to have a constant impression that may sacrifice the heart, nay ye vvould live much in apprehension of approach∣ing Judgment. Certainly the Withdrawing of many from us, and not contributing their help to the great work, they were ingaged to, as well as we, the generall Riseing against us in many places of the Coun∣trey, but above all this open sheding of the blood of the Saints, which involveth the land in the guiltiness of all the righteous blood shed from the foundation of the World, have made Scotland fit fuell for the fire of Gods Wrath. I can say nothing concerning times to come, but this, All things shall work together for good to them that Love God, and so this present di∣spensation; And they shall have most comfort in this promise, who are most willing that such afflictions as we are brought to, be the way that God choiseth to work their good. Commit wholly the management of all maters to God, and make it your intire study night and day to keep your very garments clean: It is hard in times of so generall Corruptions not to be defiled one way or other; be free of the Sin as you would be of the Judg∣ments, which will certainly be such as will make all
the Churches Know, that God is the searcher of the hearts and trier of the reins, Revel. 2.23. and so will not be mocked by these pretences whereby, men colour their going along in an evill course, from the real Love that they have to a present world. If naked Presence amongst them who are esteemed Rebels by men, be sufficient to engage them in the Crime and Punishment (for that is all the ground of my Condem∣nation) shall not God be much more Zealous of his own glory, against all who so much as seem to go a∣long with this course of backsliding. As a good Mean and encouragement, to all the duties of our time, labour to be rooted and grounded in the Love of Jesus Christ; This will be tender of a∣ny thing that may have the least reflexion upon him, His Words or Works, and will prompt the soul to Zealous appearing for Him at the greatest hazard, and to as much willingness to die for Him, as to Live that they may Glorify Him. And for the encourage∣ment of yow all in this matter▪ I do declare, that ever since the day of my coming into prison, God hath keeped my soul free from all Amazement or fear of death; that since my inditement and sentence, God hath so manifested Himself at several times, that he hath lifted up my soul above Prelats, Principalities, & PowerS, Death & Hell, to rejoice & be glad in His Salvation; and from my soul to account him Worthy, for whom in this his Cause I should undergo the great∣est shame or Paine; And to assured hopes of Eternal Communion with Him in Heaven: And that nothing hath more brangled my peace, then shifting, an open and free testimony before my Examinators, to the work that I was ingaged in.
I do freely pardon all that have accession to my blood, and wish that it be not laid to the charg of this sinful Land, but that God would grant Repentance to our Rulers, that they may obtaine the same recon∣ciliation with Him, whereof I myself do partake. Truely I beleeve many of them if not instigated by the cruel Prelats (at whose door our blood doth princi∣pally lie) would have used more mitigation: But that reluctancy of mind to shed blood, will be so far from Vindicating of them, that upon the contrary, it will be a witness against them in the Day of the Lord. I heartily submit my self to Death, as that which God hath appointed to all men because of Sin, and to this particular way of it, as deserved by my particular Sins. I praise God for this Fatherly chastisement, whereby he hath made me in part and will make me perfectly partaker of his Holiness. I glorify Him that called me forth to suffer for His Name and Ordi∣nances, and the solemne engagements of the Land to Him, and that he hath taken this way to take me a∣way from the evill to come. The Lord bless all His Poor Afflicted groaning People that are be∣hind. Hereafter I will not talk with flesh and blood, nor think on the Worlds consolations: Farewel all my Friends whose company hath been refreshful to me in my Pilgrimage; I have done with the Light of the Sun and Moon, Welcome Eternal Life, Everlasting Love, Everlasting Praise, Everlasting Glory. Praise to Him that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever. Though I have not been so with Thee as I ought to have been in the House of my Pilgrimage, yet thow hast made with me an Everlasting Cove∣nant,
Ordered in all things and Sure. And this is all my Salvation, and all my desire. Bless the Lord O my Soul! that hath pardoned all my Iniquities in the Blood of His Son, and healed all my Deseases. Bless Him O all ye his Angels that excel in strength, ye Ministers that do his pleasure. Bless the Lord O my Soul! Halelujah. Edinburgh Tolbooth, Decem∣ber 22. 1666. Sic subscribitur HEW Mc KAIL. I have heard that some of the Prisoners are willing to save their lives by taking the Declaration, That is, by abjuring that Work and Cause for which they ad∣ventured their Lives: Which if they do, our blood shall bear witness against them in the great Day of God. And God shall so punish some of them in this Life, that they shall curse the day that ever they shifted to dy on a scaffold. HEW Mc KAIL. The Testimony of JOHN WODROW, Merchant in Glasgow, who died in Edinburgh, Decemb. 22. 1666. Dear Friends. I Am condemned to die I shall say little concerning men who have judged and condemned me, they are to answer to God for it; But I bless the Lord, who
hath counted me worthy to die for so good and honour∣able a cause. And that I be not mistaken after I am gone hence, I have thought fit to testify that in single∣ness and sincerity of heart, I came into the service, not constrained but from conscience of my being engaged by Covenant to God, and with a full purpose to perform my vows made in that Covenant unto the Lord, in the strength of Jesus Christ; And that I might endeavour to restore again the precious Ordi∣nances to their former purity & power, and to recover the fair Church in this Land (which our blessed Lord hath purchased to Himself, and bought at so dear a rate) to her former Beauty, which is now defaced: And particularly to bring down that Antichristian Pre∣lacy, and that perjured crue of Prelats, who have so perfidiously wronged the Interests of our blessed Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. This is the only Cause for which I undertook this service, and joyned with others my dear and Covenanted brethren; And that I had no intention to wrong the King's person or Authority, but to seek his real good, according to my duty in the Word of God, and also as I sware in the same Covenant wherein I did swear against Prela∣cy. And notwithstanding I be condemned of men as a Rebel, yet I am justifyed of God, my God and Father, in and through my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who giveth me sweet peace of conscience and joy of heart; I grant it is not enough to justify me before Him, that I had a just Cause, unless likewise I had therewith the acceptation of my person through Faith in the Merits of Jesus Christ, who standeth in our na∣ture in heaven, which I dare declare this day as a dying man, that I have obtained; for I am confident that through His righteousness made over unto me, He
hath made me free, in which I shall stand for ever; and that within a few hours I shall see Him in peace, as I am seen of Him; and behold and wonder, and wonder and behold for evermore that most glorious excellency of His. And this yeeldeth to me great consolation in all my extremities, were they never so great; This I say is my peace and consolation this day, even Christ my Righteousness, who hath both accepted my Person and Cause: Therefore I count it a small thing to be judged and condemned of men, for my Testimony is on high, and my record in heaven. And now, my Friends, I am condemned to die for adhering to my Covenant made with God, for Refor∣mation of Religion and Conversation, to which all ranks of the Land are as well bound as I, though many (alas! too many) shaking off all fear of God have despised the Oath, not only by breaking the Cove∣nant, but by professing and declaring avowedly the bond thereof null, and not binding either to their own or other mens consciences: And this mischief is framed by a Law, which doth greatly highten the Sin; O! tell it not in Oath, and publish it not in Askelon. Oh! that this should be heard of amongst Papists and Pagans, that professed Reformed Pro∣testants should stand in so litle aw of a solemn Oath, and Name of the great and living God. But I exhort and obtest you all, that so much the more as others have made void His Covenant, you would esteem it the more precious, and closely follow the Reformation vowed, in every Article thereof, upon all occasions given you of the Lord; And that you abhor, detest and refuse any engagement whatsoever, that may wrong your Oath in the Cove∣nant directly or indirectly, as ye would escape the
wrath of God that is coming on such breaking of Co∣venant, but rather choise the greatest extremity of affliction, then the least sin of this sort; as Moses did, who refused to be called the Son of Pharaoh's Daught∣er, but chused rather to suffer reproach for Christ; And be not afraid of suffering for Christ, as though it were an evill thing, neither scar ye at His cross, for the Lord Himself saith, My yoke is easy and My burthen light; Yea it is lighter to us then to many that stand by: Believe; Faith maketh all burthens light to the believ∣ing Sufferer. And now I beseech you believers in Christ, abide in Him and bring forth fruit unto Holiness, and study tenderness in all manner of conversation, and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord; And let not this profane and mocking Generation have any thing to reproach you with, but that whereof you would not be ashamed, that when you suffer ye may not suffer as evill doers, that whereas they speak evill of you, they may be ashamed that falsly accuse your good con∣versation in Christ. It is not knowledge nor a bare Profession that glorifieth God, but Tenderness, Ho∣liness and Righteousness, that do commend Religion and His Cause to all men, and shall convince your Ad∣versaries of their Wickedness in wronging you, and make them the more inexcusable in that day when they shall be judged: Yea, what know ye, but ye may win others by your tender and good conver∣sation? I recommend to you, that ye would be much and fervent in the use of that precious duty of Prayer, wherein most near Communion with God upon earth is to be found: Be much in prayer, with and for others- Forsake not the assembling of your selves
together as the manner of some is (I wish they may see the evill of it who neglect it) but exhort one another, and so much the more, as ye see the day ap∣proaching: Earnestness and diligence will hasten the Lord's coming with relief unto you, and to the Lords born-down Work; and your slackness in this, may make the wheels of His chariot to move the more slow∣ly. For the effectuall fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much with God; It will do more then Ar∣mies of men and weapons of War for your defence and deliverance. I beseech you also, my dear Friends, that you ac∣quaint yourselves with the Word of God in the Holy Scripture, that ye may have acquaintance with Jesus Christ who is clearly set forth therein; that ye may know Him in His excellency and come to love and be∣lieve in Him whom ye know; that ye may be acquaint∣ed with His revealed will therein, and may know what is truth, and cleave fast thereto, from a sure persuasion that it hath the warrant of His Word; and may be guarded against every error of the wicked, and that ye may fully know what is good and what is evill; And that ye may suffer with confidence, when ye are brought forth thereto as I am. Finally, my dear Friends, be ye perfect, be of good comfort, be of one minde, live in peace- and the God of love and peace shall be with you. JOHN WODROW.
The Copy of JOHN WODROW His Letter to His Wife, dated De∣cemb. 22. 1666. which was the Day on which He suffered. My Heart, REverence the good Providence of the Lord our God, who can do nothing wrong; For what∣soever He doth is well-done, and my Soul faith, Amen. I had not a will of my own (my Heart) since that day wherein Yow and I parted, My Lord and my God captivated it, & brought it to a submission unto His will: I bless Him for evermore for it, that I was never left to my own will: Praise, O praise Him all ye living! And O thou my soul praise the Lord for it. I bless the Lord for evermore that ever He visited my Fathers Family, that ever He condes∣cended to come unto my Fathers Family, and to give a visit to the like of me: He visited me there, and set his Love upon me, and hath chosen me for this very end, to be a witness for his covenanted Reforma∣tion. For this my Soul is glad, and my Glory re∣joyceth for this Honour wherewith He hath honoured me; And that, though I be condemned to die by men on earth, yet am I justifyed of God through the blood of my Saviour Jesus Christ, who standeth in our na∣ture in Heaven, and hath made me free through his imputed Righteousness made over unto me, in which I stand for ever; And within a few hours I shall see Him in peace, as I am seen of Him, and behold and
wonder, and wonder & behold for evermore, even that most glorious excellency which is in Him. All that which is spoken of Him is but litle: O my Heart, my dear Love, come and see I beseech yow! I thought I had known something of my dearest Lord before, that I had some love from and to Him before, But never was it so with me, as it hath been with me since I came within the doors of this Prison; many a pre∣cious visit hath his gracious Majesty given unto me. He is without all comparison; O love, love Him! 0 come to Him, O taste and see, and that shall resolve the question best. The thing I suffer for is the Cove∣nanted Reformation. I bless God, and all that is within me doth bless and magnify His Holy Name for this, tnat Scotland did ever enter into a Covenant with the Lord, into a sworn Covenant, with the hand lift∣ed up to the Lord: And I have now sworn and renued this Covenant again for my self & you, and my four Children in all the parts and points thereof; And I pray, God help you to abide in the Covenant for ever. And now I give you and my four Children unto the Lord, and commit you ro Him as your Covenanted God and Husband, & my Childrens Covenanted Father. I say no more, but either study to be indeed a sincere Christian, & a seeker of His face in sincerity, or else you will be nothing at all. I recommend you and your young-ones to Him, who is God All-sufficient, and aboundeth in Mercy and Love to them that Love Him and keep his Covenant. The blessing of the Covenant be upon you, so fare you well. So saith Your loving and dying Husband JOHN WODROW.
The Testimony of RALPH SHIELDS, An English-man who died in Edinburgh, Decemb. 22. 1666. My Friends. I Am come here to die, and I thank God, it is not for evill doing that I now suffer: although I be charged with Rebellion against the Kings Authority, yet 1 declare before God and you all, that in all this matter I never intended to wrong his Majestie's just Power and greatness, but for conscience sake did respect Authority as the Ordinance of God appointed for the punishment of evill doers, and that I wish his Ma: all welfare both in this life, and the world to come, and that it may be his happiness to consider his Obligations to God and Perform the same, that so it may be well with him and his Posterity to many gene∣rations; and I pray God make him a friend to His Cause and the truly Godly who own the same, though falsly called Phanaticks or turbulent persons. I declare I have such persuasion of the Interest of Religion Reformed, and sworn unto in the Covenant that I dare venture not only to lay down my own life, but if every hair of my head were a man, they should all be put to venture for this cause: I would not have the world to stumble at the Cause, because of my death after this manner; for I rejoyce greatly in it, and I desire every good Christian as they tender their own souls that they would grip fast, lay hold on, and cleave to Jesus Christ and His way.
My coming out at this time (I say) was not against his Majesty, but for the Covenant which is now troden under foot; my intention was for the Cause of Christ; I take God to witness, it was nothing else I came out for, and for that I am free to lay down my life. I bless God I am much encouraged in this, and not at all afraid to die for so good and clear a Cause; and I hope He will bring me thorow all my difficulties in this dark shadow of death: I hope I have the peace of a good conscience, and have had some glimpses from Jesus Christ of His countenance and reconciled Face, since I came into this prison, for which I desire to bless His Name with all my soul, heart and spirit. And I rejoyce that He hes made use of me to suffer for His Cause; And I think it too litle, not only to lay down my body, but (if it were possible) even my very soul at the stake for that Cause and for Jesus Christ my good and kind Master, who hath loved me and given Him∣self for me. I give the Lord thanks that I had some of His Presence since I came into this condition: and again I say, I am much encouraged and not afraid to die, and bless Him that I die not as a murtherer, or evill door, or Rebel to Authority, but for such a cause as this. O that it were the happiness of my Nation of Eng∣land, once to subiect themselves unto the sweet yoke of Christs Reformed Government, under which this Nation of Scotland hath enjoyed so much of the Power and life of the Gospel, by a faithful Ministry according to the Covenant sworn by them both. And now, my dear Friends in Christ, and fellow-Cove∣nanters, though I be a stranger in this Land, being an En∣glish-man, but trifted by providence in the prosecution
of my calling, to have my residence for a time here in Scotland, which I look upon, as a singulare evidence of God's special love to me, though I be a stranger, I say, to many of you, yet I must be bold as a dying friend, to beseech you by the mercy of God, and by your ap∣pearance before Jesus Christ, when we shall have to do with none but Him as our Judge, that ye be faith∣full and stedfast in the Cause of God, and Covenant which ye have sworn with hands lifted up to the most high God, which no Power on earth can loose you from, and that ye keep you from snares unto the con∣trary, and not suffer your selves to fall into a detestable Neutrality and Indifferency in that Cause of God; And especially that ye keep your selves free of any En∣gagements by word or write, that may wrong your Oath of the Covenant. I commit my Wife and Children to His care, who careth for them that put their trust in Him before the Sons of men, not doubting but they shall be eyed with goodwil and favor by the Godly, after I am gone. And now I render up my Spirit to Him who gave it me, and for whose sake I now lay down my life. To this God, my Covenanted God, be glory, blessing and praise for now and ever, Amen. That this is my mind and Testimony, which I leave behind me, I witness by my ordinary subscrip∣tion, R. SHIELDS.
The Testimony of HUMPREY COLHOUNE, At his Death in Edinburgh, De∣cemb. 22. 1666. Dear Friends and Spectators, I am come here this Day to this Place to die this Death, for crimes for which (I thank God) my Conscience doth not condemn me. My crime, as is alleaged, is for Disloyalty against the King's Majesty; Yet I thank God, that my appearing lately with the Lord's People was from my sense of my obligation in the Covenant, and the sense of the wrongs done in the Land, and the crying oppressions committed therein. This was the end of my appearing for the Lord against His enemies, to bear witness against the same: The which obligation of the Oath of God, I judge that none on earth can loose the Conscience from. I bless the Lord again and again, I die for this Oath and Covenant; And I thank God also, that I have by the great mercy of the Almighty God in Christ Jesus, obtained mercy and forgiveness for all my transgressions both against the first and second Table of the Law: And that through that Ocean of grace which is in the Lord Jesus Christ, I believe that I am justified and sanctified, and believe now to be glori∣fied with Him, by that blessed blood of His, which hath purchased this Salvation to me, through faith in the same, made application of, according to the good Covenant of grace. He hath performed this, out of his vvonderfull and incomparable free-grace▪ And
this is my joy and exceeding great rejoycing and con∣solation, and all my salvation, for vvhich I am Grace's debtor throughout all Eternity. I die vvith this my Testimony, my adherence to the National Covenant, to the Solemn League and Covenant, to the Work of Reformation a great length carried on, and now over∣thrown most sinfully by ungodly Men, vvho have esta∣blished their Apostacy by Law, which no just Power on earth could ever do. Also I adhere to the Presbyterial Government, the Confession of Faith, Cathechisms Larger and Shorter, And to the Solemn Acknovv∣ledgement of the Church of Scotland, And Publick Testimonies thereof against the sins of the time. This day I rejoyce that He hath counted me vvorthy to lay dovvn my life for Him, as one that beareth vvitness against the breach of all the Sacred Oaths and Ties that were established in this Land, yea by the just Laws both of God and Man, which never could have been repealed lawfully, as this wicked Generation hath done. Dear Friends, I hope ye will stand fast in this Obli∣gation, and in the Solemn Oaths and Ties ye are under, and all the body of the Land also will be stedfast in the same, upon the greatest hazard ye can meet with; And that ye will study perfect holiness and nearness with God, which will help to keep you straight in this day of Persecution and sharp Triall that is now raging in this Land: I bless the Lord, I die not a fool, though some men have thought so of me by their speeches to me, since my imprisonment: neither durst I ever be the man to buy my liberty at such a dear rate as Perjury, and to shake off these blessed bonds I did vvillingly come under; And I thank God, I never yet to this moment rued or repented it; And sure I am
it is better for me to suffer the vvorst of deaths, then to preserve my life by breaking the Oaths of God. I also give my Testimony against Prelacy and that vvick∣ed Hierarchy novv established in this Land, as that vvhich the Church of Christ could never bear until this day, it being such a grand Enemy to the purity of the Gospel, and povver of Godliness, yea a yoke vvhich the Church of God groaneth under. I have no more to say, but commends all you the lovers of our Lord Jesus Christ to God Himself, and to the good vvord of His grace, vvhich is able to build you up untill the day of His appearance, and to give you all an inheritance with them that are sanctified through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. And subscribes my self an expectant and apparent heir of the grace of Christ. HUMPREY COLHOUN. The Testimony of JOHN WILSON, Who suffered at Edinburgh, Decemb. 22. 1666. Good People and Spectators. I Am here condemned to die upon alleaged Rebellion against the King and his Authority, which God knoweth, I never intended. For in my judgement, a man's endeavouring to extirpate perjured Prelates and abjured Prelacy, according as he is bound by Oath in a sworn Covenant, may very well stand with a man's Loyalty to King and Countrey; for I am sure, the
King and his Subjects may be happy, yea more happy in the extirpation of Prelates and Prelacy, then in their standing; Yea the Throne shall never be established in peace, until that wicked plant be plucked up by the roots, which hath so much wasted and made desolate the Lord's Vineyard: For my part, I pray that the Lord may bless our King with blessings from Heaven, and make him a friend to the Interests of Christ, as the best way for the standing of his Throne to many gene∣rations; And I pray for all that are in Authority under his Majesty, that the Lord may not lay to their charge the innocent blood of His Saints, which they have shed. But the ground of my sentence is truly, the re∣newing of the Covenant with my God, and labouring to defend the same, according to my Oath: And this I profess is and was my duty, and by the grace of God will not quite it; And in token hereof, I am here before you all to lay down my life in defence of the same, and require you all to be witnesses to this my Testimony; I do declare, I am not ashamed, but count it my glory. I do likewise declare this before you all in the sight of God, the Judge of all hearts, that since the day I did first swear and subscribe this Covenant for Reformation, it hath been sweet unto me, for I am persuaded in my Conscience of the war∣rantableness thereof. I did swear the Covenant four times, and the last time at Lanerk, which was the sweetest time to me of them all; For with my whole soul I renewed it, and gave up both my soul and body to Him, to be at His disposal, which, I trust in God, I shall never rue. Hearty praise and thanks be to the blessed God, that ever it pleased Him to give unto this poor Church that mercy to enter in Covenant with Himself, that He might be unto us a Cove∣nanted
God, the richest mercy that can be bestowed on men. I have lived a Presbyterian in my judgement, according as I have sworn, and judge it to be the only way that God hath appointed in His word, for the Government of His Church on earth; for under that Government the power and practice of Religion hath greatly flourished, and many a soul hes been converted to the Lord, and found sweet fellowship with Him in His Ordinances, by the Ministry of His honest and and lawfully called Servants. And blessed be the day that ever I heard a faithfull sent Minister preach the Gospell. I do declare before heaven and earth that my whole designe in this Rising in Armes, was only against abjured Prelacy and Prelaetes, the great Op∣pressors of God's Interests, and cruell persecuters of His People, both in their consciences and bodies; and I judge their Government and why not to be con∣forme to the Word of God in the Holy Scriptures. I might cite many Scriptures to this purpose, but I shall only name two Luke 22.26. but ye shall not be so; but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the yonger; and be that is chief, as he that doth serve. And 1 Pet. 5.3. neither as being Lords over God's heritage, &c. Yea it may be seen from sad experience, that under their Government, the power of Godli∣ness hath decayed, and avowed profanity and Popery it self hath increased, both to the dishonor of the holy Lord, and the great grief of the hearts of the Godly. I am so persuaded of tne truth of the Covenant, and of the error of their way, and that Jesus Christ is the on∣ly King and Lord over His own House, and besides Him there is none else, for He will not give His glory to another, I am so persuaded of these things, that I
dare seal the truth thereof with my blood, and am come hither for the same end, without any fear or amazement; yea if every hair of mine head were a man, I would have ventured all according to the Co∣venant which I made with my God; And although I be a poor polluted sinner, and my house not so with God, as it became; yet hath He made with me an everlasting Covenant, well ordered in all things and sure, and this is all my Salvation and all my desire; And I hope the Lord will soon tread down all His enemies with shame, and the enemies of His Cove∣nant also. Therefore, let all that love the Lord Jesus Christ and His Truth and Covenant, take comfort and courage, notwithstanding of all that which is come to pass, And let them not be ashamed to adhere thereunto, whatsoever sufferings they meet with there∣in, for He will make up that loss in Himself, and a∣venge the wrongs done to Himself & them in His own due time: I assure you, Christ is a good Master to serve: if ye knew Him rightly & His cross, it is sweet & easy to the believer; for He maketh death to be life, and bringeth light out of darkness. I desire to follow the blessed Captain of my salvation through well and wo. I beseech you, my dear Friends, whom now I am to part with, that ye stand to the defence of all the truths of God and of His Word; & that ye receive the Lord Christ, as He hath offered Himself therein, ye who have not closed with Him; And that he who hath closed with Him, abide in Him by a lively faith and love, bring∣ing forth fruits, that you may put credit on your pro∣fession, and keep off every thing that may shame your glorious and blessed Master before this evill and adul∣terous generation. And I give you all warning and de∣ort you heartily as ye love your own souls, and as ye
will answer to Him, who shall judge the quick and dead, that ye stand fast in all the duties ye are sworn unto in the National and in the Solemn League and Covenant, both towards God, your King and one another: And that ye beware of snares in taking of any Oaths or Declarations contrary in the least, to the Oath of God in these Covenants. I leave my wife and little children upon Jesus Christ my Lord, who are now to be made a widow and fatherless for His sake, trusting, He will care for them; And I recommend them to the counsell and kindness of His people under Him. I can forgive the wrong done to me in taking away my life for this Cause, and wish God to be mer∣ciful to these that have condemned me, or have had any hand in my death: But blessed be God, that brought and hath kept me on His side of this Cause, and honoured me to be a publick witness for Him and His blessed Truth; and Cause; for which I shall praise Him in the World to come, whether I now go: yea I will praise Him on the borders of Death & Eternity. To His blessed Name, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost be praise for now and ever. So saith your dying friend for Christ. JOHN WILSON. A true Relation of the Sufferings and Death of MR HEW Mc KAIL. Preacher of the Gospel. MR Hew Mc Kail having passed, and improven the vertuous means of his Education (at the Uni∣versity
of Edinburgh, and with his Uncle Mr Hew Mc Kail, Minister there, in whose family he did re∣side) to the satisfaction and good hope of all, in the Winter 1661. upon the very turne of this sad Cata∣strophe, offers himself to Tryall (being 20 years old) before the Presbytery of Edinburgh, in order to the work of the Ministery; and being by them amply approven and licensed, and having preached at several times with the great benefit and applause of all his hear∣ers, he did preach his last publick Sermon in Edin∣burgh, in the Great Church thereof, upon the Sabbath immediatly preceeding that 8 of September 1662. the day affixed by the then Parliament, for the removal of the Ministers of Edinburgh. His text was Song. 1.7. In this Sermon taking oc∣casion to speak of the great and many persecutions, to which the Church of God hath been and is obnoxious; and amplifying the Point from the Persons and Pow∣ers who have been instrumental therein, he said, that the Church and People of God had been persecuted, both by a Pharaoh upon the Throne, a Haman in the State, and a Iudas in the Church; and falling to in∣large the several wayes and manner of the Persecutions of these men, & the issue thereof; the cases of Haman and Iudas appeared in the conviction of his Adversa∣ries, to have such a near resemblance to the state and condition of the then Rulers of State and Church, that though he did make no Application, yet he was reputed to be guilty thereof. Whereupon, within a few dayes thereafter, there was a Party of Horsemen sent to the Place where he then lived near to Edinburgh, for to seise his Person and make him Prisoner. But upon almost no more then a moments advertisement, he escapes out of his bed,
and shifting only to another chamber, was miracu∣lously preserved from the Search then used, though most diligent and accurate. For this cause, he being necessitated to leave that Place, retired home-ward to his Fathers house, where having lurked a while, and thereafter as occasions call'd him spent the four years that have since interveen'd, in several places and with much uncertainty. Yet during all this space, to the certain knowledge and sweet remembrance of all that conversed with him, he was most seriously exercised in the Study of Piety and true Knowledge, wherein as he greatly advanced above all his equalls, so at length he became most eminent and exemplary. While he is thus living and employed at his Fathers house, the late Troubles arising: in the West fall out; and the newes thereof having alarmed him with the rest of that Countrey, upon the 18. of Nov. last, being the Sabbath; for such motives and upon such considera∣tions as he himself doth fully afterward declare, he joined himself to those who rose in these parts for the assisting of that poor afflicted Party, as in their con∣sciences, by their Covenant, they thought them∣selves indispensably obliged. When and where he joined with them, or what was his part, or endeavours amongst them, needs not to be remembered. Only this is certain, that being of a thin body, and tender constitution, he was so disabled and weakened with the toil and fatigue of continual marching and tempestuous weather (par∣ticularly at Air, where he lay a considerable time, as if he had been dead, by reason of fainting) that he could no longer endure it. Whereupon, on Tues∣day Novemb. 27. he was necessitated to part from them in the morning, near to the New Bridge upon Cramond
water: And in his way towards Libberton Parish, about twelve of the clock passing through Bread's Craigs, he was taken, without resistance, having on∣ly a small ordinary sword, by such of the Countrey∣men, as were then sent out to view the fields; in which passage it is very observable, that his escape formerly mentioned was not more miraculous, then his present taking was fatal: for it is without question, had he but retained and observed the least of that adver∣tency and caution, wherein at other times he was known to be both ready & very happy, he might, with∣out either hazard or trouble, have escaped this incon∣venience; but God who gave him the full experience of his turning all things unto the good of them that love Him, did thus by his simplicity and folly, prepare the way for His own Glory and His servants joy and Vic∣tory. Being brought to Edinburgh, and first to the Towns Council-house, in their search for letters he was im∣mediatly stript; and there being none found, com∣mitted prisoner to the Tolbuith. Upon the Wedensday, being the 28 of November by order from the Secret Council, he was brought be∣fore the Earle of Dumfreis, Lord Sinclar, Sir Robert. Man∣ray of Preist-field and others, in order to his Examina∣tion; and being interrogate concerning his joyning & being with the Wesi-land forces, he conceaving himself not obliged by any Law or Reason, to be his own Ac∣cuser, to the destruction of his life, did plainly deny the question; but being desired to signe with his hand, what he had said and they caused write, though at first he appeared willing, yet partly being advised by the Lord Sinclar, to beware that he subscribed nothing, whereof the contrary would be found true, left it
might therefore fare the worse with him, and partly scrupling at the terms of Rebells and Rebellion, wherein the question and his Answer were conceaved, and partly bethinking that a simple denyall may import more then the pleading of Not-guilty, he refused to sub∣scribe his name, which being reported to the Council gave great offence, and brought him under the suspi∣tion of a deep dissembler. On Thursday Novemb. 29. being again called before his Examinators, upon the considerations mentioned, & for allaying the Councils prejudice, & preventing the inconvenience he might there-through sustain, he gives in a Declaration under his own hand, testifying, that he had been with the Westland Forces, with whom he occasionally mett, and that he resolved to have withdrawn from them upon the first opportunity which he was also about to do when he was taken, without either offering to flee or resist, which he desi∣red the Council the rather to believe, because he had told so much to William Lawry of Blackwood, a person imployed from the Lieut. Generall Dalzell to the West∣land Forces. But notwithstanding that William Lawry did testify this to be a truth, yet the Council retaining former impressions, and apprehending that the pre∣sence and confronting of some other Prisoners of the Westland Forces (who plainly declared their accession to that Rising) and their deponing concerning him, did only move Mr Hew to this acknowledgement, al∣though it be certainly known, that he had formed and subscribed the same the night before, they fortify and persist in their jealousy, and suspecting him to have been a contriver of the Insurrection, and privy to all Designes and Intelligence relating to it, they dealt with him with great importunity to be ingenuous, and
to declare who were the Ring-leaders of the late Ris∣ing, and what correspondence either at home or abroad was kept anent it: And this was done especially upon the Monday Dec. 3. at which time also the Boots (a terrible instrument of Torture, which the humanity of our later times hath so much abhorred, that not only the fashion of them was forgot, but all Torture for their cause, disused; yet new ones such as they are) were laid before him, upon the Town Council-House table, and he certifyed, that if he would not confess, he should be tortured by them to morrow. And ac∣cordingly upon Tuesday Dec. 4. he was again called before the Council, where, after the Examination & Torture of Iohn Nilson of Corsack, he was again examin∣ed by the Earle of Rothess the Kings Commissioner, the Marquess of Montress, and several of the Privy Councill, (in the Town Council-House) the Bishop of St An∣drewes for the honor of his profession forsooth, and some others of the Counsellers upon more real and Christian motives, having at first withdrawn themselves: And being urged to confess, he declared, with a solemn Attestation, that he knew no more, then he had alrea∣dy confessed, whereupon they ordered the Execution∣er to put his leg into the Boot and to proceed to the Torture. But as he had before confessed and de∣clared ingenuously all he knew, so this Torture (though in it self very violent and painful, by the extraordinary compression both of flesh, sinews and bones, by the force of timber wedges and hammer, & used upon him in a double measure, even to ten or eleven strokes, with considerable intervals; as there remained no truth concealed which it could extort) did not in the least move him to express any impatience or bitterness, but having sustained it most constantly and Christianly,
before he got the last three strokes, he protested solemn∣ly in the sight of God, that he could say no more, though all the joints of his body were in as great torture as that poor leg, and desires to know what could hin∣der them to believe one of his Profession, who had so solemnly declared as in the sight of God, that he knew no more then he had told, viz. that to the best of his knowledge, the Rising in the West was meerly occasio∣nal, upon a discontent betwixt the people in the Stewarty of Galloway & Sir Iames Turner, to which every one did run, as their hearts moved them when they heard of it. This Torture was the cause why he was not indicted with the first ten, who being arraigned and sentenced on Wedensday Dec. 5. were hanged on the Fryday there∣after, at the Cross of Edinburgh. Many thought that considering his small accession unto that Rising, which neither was nor could be proven to be more, then what he himself had freely confessed, and that he had suffer∣ed such hard measure by Torture, & that not in order to the discovery of his own Crime, but the declaring of the Contrivers and his Complices, that the same should have procured him favor, but the matter was otherwise determined. Neither was the Sermon be∣fore mentioned, so quite forgotten, though ill remem∣bered, and often repeated in Councill in these words Achab upon the Throne, and no more, and therefore Upon Monday the 10 of Dec. he and other seven re∣ceaved their Indictments of Treason, & were acording∣ly summoned to appear before the Iustices on Wedensday Dec. 12. But his Torture & close Imprisonment there∣after (for so it was ordered) having cast him in a Fever; whereby he was utterly disenabled to make his appear∣ance, Upon Tuesday Dec. 11. he gave in to the Lords of
Council his Supplication of the Tenor following viz. that whereas I have receaved an Indictment of Trea∣son, which was yesterday delivered to me, and I ap∣pointed to make answer thereto to morrow, and seing in this matter of the highest importance, not only all the time allowed is very short, but I am and have been ever since my Torture in a great distemper and Fever, besides the great pain and utter inability of my leg, which hath constantly kept me bed-fast, and doth render me incapable not only of minding my own De∣fence, but wholly unable either to walk or stand, far less to go and compeir before the Lord Iustice, as I doubt not but Physicians will testify, if your Lo: will order them to visit me, which I humbly beg; And se∣ing my accession to the Crimes libelled is so very slender, being only simple Presence, and that not only occasional, as I did declare before Your Lo: but also in some sort re∣tracted and purged, by my purposed and actuall off-com∣ing and deserting; and lastly, seing I was put to sore Tor∣ture, in order to a furder discovery, with a promise of favor, in case of my Ingenuity, which I then singly us∣ed, as in the sight of God, to the utmost of my know∣ledge: May it therefore please Your Lordships, gra∣ciously to consider the Premises, specially my utter inability to make my appearance, and to surcease any legall procedor against me, in this so weak and ex∣tream condition, and to discharge me of the foresaid Citation and Appearance. And your Lo: answer. This Petition and the following are therefore sett
down verbatim, that both the utmost of his condes∣cendence may appear, and the fainting that he so much regrates in his last Speach, be the better understood. And with the same subscribed by him, there was given in, an Attestation under the hands of seven Chirurge∣ons, declaring his weak and sickly condition. Hereupon the Council did order two Physicians, and two Chirurgeons (viz. Sir Robert Cuningham, Doctor Hay, Iames otwick, and Thomas Kinkead.) to visit him, and to return their Attestation upon soul and conscience, betwixt and the morrow at ten of the Clock, to the Iustices. Upon Wedensday Decemb. 12. the Iustices being set, the Attestation of the two Doctors and Chirur∣geons above mentioned, is produced for Mr Hew Mc Kail, and other three of the Prisoners indicted, and their excuse proponed thereupon. But the Iustice finding, that the Attestation, not bearing soul and con∣science, did not agree to the Warrand and Order given by the Councill, and that the Physicians being called, did refuse upon point of Priviledge to rectify it in these terms, although they declared, that the truth there∣of was such, as they might safely confirm it by Oath, they do only supersede their procedor against M. Hew, and other two contained in the Attestation, untill to morrow, and ordain Iohn Nilson of Corsack, though also contained in the Attestation, in respect the same as to his part, was not relevant, and the other four, to be brought to the Bar, who accordingly being brought, were that day sentenced to be hanged on Fry∣day thereafter. Thursday December 13. the Iustice-Court being set, adjourns untill Tuesday thereafter, and ordains M. Hew and the other two to be peremptorily sisted that day
before the down-sitting of the Court. This afternoon, having obtain'd his Reprivall, in the thoughts of his dubious condition, he composed the lines follow∣ing. Vitae ergò innumeris curarum erroribus actae, Clausula consimilis perbreve finit iter. Distrahor ambigui dubio discrimine fati: Aeger enim jaceo; sin revalesco, cado. Saturnday Dec. 8. his Brother M. Matthew goes from Edinburgh to Glasgow, with a Letter from the Lady Mar∣quess of Dowglass, and another from the Duchess of Ha∣milton to the Lord Commissioner in his favors, but both proved ineffectual. Like-as his Cusing M. Matthew Mc Kail carried another Letter from the Lady Marquess of Dowglass to the Arch∣bishop of St Andrewes for the same purpose, but with no better success. Dec. 18. Sitting in Judgement, the Lord Penton Iustice Clerk, and Mr William Murray (Advocate) Iustice Depute. M. Hew being indifferently recovered, he was brought before the Iustice with other 3 that were ar∣raigned with him. And first, the general Indictment is read, founded both on old and late Acts of Parlia∣ments, made against Rising and Assembling in Arms, and entering into Leagues and Covenants, and renew∣ing the Solemn League and Covenant, without or against the Kings Authority, declaring the same to be Rebellion and Treason; and thereafter amply sub∣suming upon all the Acts, Deeds and Passages of the late Insurrection with many aggravations; particu∣larly upon their taking and renewing the Solemn
League and Covenant at Lanerk; And therefore charging them with, and concluding, that they ought to be punished for the same as Traitors. After which Mr Hew his special Indictment is read, bearing, that he had risen and joyned with the Rebels, and was with them at Air, Vchilery and Lanerk, and several other places on horsback, and had kept and was at several of their Rendevouz's with a Sword. Whereunto Mr Hew being permitted to answer, began his discourse very constantly and composedly, declaring, that he looked upon himself, both from the conclusion of his Indict∣ment, and what had happened to others, as a man ap∣pointed by men, and determined in himself to die, whereupon he thought himself obliged to use the great∣er ingenuity, and then affirmed, that he was not ashamed to avow that he was one of that afflicted and persecuted party and perswasion called Presbyterian. Thereafter he proceeded to speak of the Ties and En∣gagements that were upon the Land to God, in order thereto, and having commended the Institution. Dig∣nity and Blessing of Presbyterial Government, he said that the last words of the National Covenant had al∣wayes great weight upon his spirit. Whereupon the King's Advocate, interrupting him, desired him to forbear that discourse, telling him that he was not there called in question for his perswasion, but for the crime of Rebellion, in rising in Arms against his Ma: Authority, to which he desired him to answer; where∣unto he answered, that the thing which moved him to declare himself as he had, and would have done, was that weighty and important saying of our Lord Jesus, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of Man also confess before the Angels of God; but he that denieth me and my words before men, shall he denyed before the An¦gels
of God. As for the Rebellion he was charged with, he said; his Accession was only simple presence with a Sword, and that occasional, as his confession before the Council did bear. The Advocate answers, that not only presence, such as he was charged with, was treasonable, but all intercommuning or keeping com∣pany with Rebells, though for the space only of half an hour; and however, he said, he was guilty of a far deeper accession, and of many other things besides these contained in his own confession; whereupon the Advocate caused read his Confession, and also the de∣positions of severall others that were examined, in so far as they concerned him. M. Hew answered, that all the depositions read, contained no more then was in his own Confession, nor could they make out any more against him; and so in effect it was. The Advocate after the sustaining of the Indictment, having made use of; and caused read the confessions of M. Hew and the other persons accused before the Assize, in place of Probation, referred the matter to their Cognition. The Assize being enclosed gave their Verdict una voce, and by the mouth of Sir William Murray of Newtown their Chancellor, report him to be guilty of being with the Rebells at severall times and places, and at their Rendevouz with a Sword, according to his subscribed confession. However it was thereafter understood, that four or five of the Assize, did with reluctancy pronounce this Verdict▪ thinking death too great a pu∣nishment for so slender a Guilt, and that the major part of the Assize had cleansed him, if the fear of an Assize of Error had not prevailed with them. The Verdict being reported, Doom was pronounc∣ed, decerning and adjudging him and the rest to be
taken on Saturnday Decemb. 22. to the Mercate Cross of Edinburgh, and there to be hanged on a Gibbet till they be dead, and that their Goods and Lands be escheated and forfeited for his Highness's use. At the hearing of which sentence, he cheerfully said, The Lord giveth life, and the Lord taketh, blessed be the Name of the Lord. And as he was carried back through the Guards to the Tolbooth, when the People made la∣mention, he answered, Though men cut us off, God will receave us, trust in God, trust in God. Being come to his Chamber, he immediately ad∣dressed himself to God by prayer, with great enlarge∣ment of heart for himself and his fellow-prisoners con∣demned with him. Being afterwards asked, how his leg was, which was tortured; he answered merrily, "the fear of my Neck now maketh me forget my Leg. Thereafter he said. to another freind, O how good Newes, to be within four dayes journey to enjoy the sight of Jesus Christ, and protested he vvas not so cumbered hovv to die, as he had been some∣time to preach a Sermon. To some vvomen lament∣ing for him, he said, that his condition, though he vvas young, and in the budding of his hopes and la∣bours in the Ministry, yet vvas not to be mourned for; for, said he, one drop of my blood, through the Grace of God, may make moe hearts contrite, then many years sermons might have done. This afternoon he supplicat the Council for liberty to his Father to come & visit him, vvhich being granted, his Father the next night came to him. Their first meet∣ing was very sad; & notwithstanding, that according both to the testimony of his Parents, and knovvledge of all his relations, he vvas a most obedient Son; yet these inevitable infirmities vvhich are incident to
the best of men, and cannot but furnish sad convictions, when considered in the power and pure light of the spi∣ritual Law of God, did greatly trouble him in the re∣membrance of the fifth commandment. The passage was thus. After prayer his Father said unto him, Hugo, I called thee a goodly clive-tree of fair fruits, and now a storm hath destroyed the tree and his fruits and branches. He ansvvered, that his Fathers too good thoughts of him had afflicted him. His Father said, he was perswaded, God was visiting not his own sin, but his parents sin upon him, so that he might say, Our Fathers have sinned, and we have born their iniquity. He said also, I have sinned, thow poor sheep what hast thow done. M. Hew ansvvered with many groans, that through coming short of keeping the fifth commandment, he had come short of the promise, that his days should be prolonged in the Land of the living, and that Gods con∣troversy with him, was for overvaluing his children, especially himself. On Thursday the 20 of December more from the im∣portunity of Friends, then of his own inclination, he gave in to the Privy Council, a Petition, as fol∣lows. That whereas upon Tuesday last I was indicted and condemned, for the treasonable deeds contained in the general and special Indictment exhibited against me; in the which special Indictment, containing my whole accession to the said Crimes, there is only libelled pre∣sence in several places, with an ordinary sword, likeas my own confession, which is the naked truth, doth de∣clare, how the same was occasional; And seeing that it was also in some sort purged & retracted by my with∣drawing
and deserting with the first conveniency, whereby not only my case appears to be different from that of others, but also as favourable as possibly can be, nixt to innocency it self; likeas the same appeared no less to many of these Gentlemen who were upon my As∣size. And seeing the Torture I sustained, and the inge∣nuity I then used, as in the sight of God, to the utmost of my knowledge, deserve that favour that was at that time insinuated; And that it is expected that his Majesty (whose mercy I beg) according to his great clemen∣cy and the most usual practice in the like cases, will in∣terpose his mercy, for the rescue of many, who are e∣qually with me involved. May it therefore please your Lordships graciously to consider the premisses, and to pardon my great rashnes and precipitancy, and therefore to indulge such a reprival at your Lo. shall think convenient, until his Majesty's gracious pleasure anent the premisses shall be fully known; At least till the Commissioner his Grace, do return; And your Lo. answer. The words marked in this Petition by a different character, were the amendments of his Friends affection, which they were advised to put in, by some members of the Privy Council, to whom the copy of it had been presented immediately before the downsitting of the Councill; and thereupon the Peti∣tion being transcribed, was in so great haste presented unto him, to subscribe it, that he got it not read. However the Petition was both disrelished and re∣fused by the Council; The truth is, some of his Friends exceeding zealous of his safety, had moved to several
members of the Council, that the Declaration might be tendered to him, and some time permitted him to advise thereanent; which motion, it's like, was attended with some insinuations, that probably he might be induced to subscribe it; but as the motion was ineffec∣tual without a warrand under his own hand, so even the Authors thereof do bear him witness of his positive, fixed and often declared resolution, not to subscribe it at the highest rate: Likeas, upon some surmises to the contrary, he thought it necessary for his own vindica∣tion, to leave it under his hand, that the above-men∣tioned resolution was from his own proper knowledge and motive, without the assistance of the least disswa∣sive from any other person. During his abode in Prison, the Lord was very gra∣ciously present with him, both to sustain him against the fear of death, and to dispel all these over-cloudings of terror, unto which the frailty of flesh and blood hath sometime exposed the best of men; and also in assisting him in prayer and praises, to the admiration of all his hearers, especially on the Thursday's night Dec. 20. whereon being set at supper with his fellow-prisoners and his Father, and one or two besides, he requested his fellow-prisoners, saying merrily, eat to the full, and cherish your bodies, that we may all be a fat Christmass Pie to the Prelates. After supper in thanks∣giving he burst forth in blessing God, that had made him such a fool as to come to that prison; and after many gracious words, continued saying, many crosses have come in our way and wrought but weakly upon us, but here is a cross that hath done more good then all the many that be∣fell us before. Then lamenting the condition of the Church of God, with much earnestness, he used that
exclamation in the last of Daniel, What Lord shall be the end of these wonders! The last night of his life, being Fryday Decemb. 21. he proponed and answered himself, several questions, to the strengthening of his fellow-prisoners, and great refreshing of all his hearers. As 1. he inquired; How should he, going from the Tolbooth through a mul∣titude of gazing People and guards of Souldiers, to a Scaffold and Gibbet, overcome the impression of al these? To which he answered; By conceaving a deeper impression of a multitude of Angels who are also on-look∣ers; According to that, we are a gazing-stock to the VVorld, Angels and Men: For the Angels rejoycing at our good confession are present to convey and carry our souls as the soul of Lazarus, unto Abraham's bosom; Not to receave them, for that is Iesus Christ's work alone, who will welcome them to Heaven Himself, with the songs of Angels and blessed Spirits; But the Angels are ministring Spirits, always ready to serve and streng∣then all dying believers. 2. As Stephen saw the Heavens opened, and Iesus standing on the right hand of God, VVho then said, Lord Iesus, receave my Spirit, so (said he) do I believe, that Iesus Christ is also ready to receave the souls of his dying sufferers. 2. He enquired, VVhat is the way for us to con∣ceave of Heaven who are hasting unto it, seing the Word saith, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him? Whereunto he answered, that the Scripture helps us two wayes
to conceave of heaven. The first is by way of simi∣litudes, as in that Rev. 21. where heaven is held forth, by the representation of a glorious City, there described; but in the same place it is also termed the Bride; but O how unlike are these two, a Bride and a City! which doth clearly evidence the insufficiency and vast disproportion of all such similitudes; and therefore he addeth, the Scripture furnisheth yet a more excellent way to conceave of heaven; and that is 1. by conceiving the love of Christ to us, even what is the breadth and length and depth and hight and the immenseness of that love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, which is also the highest and sweetest motive of praise; unto him, that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and His Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen. 2. By holding forth the love of the Saints to Jesus Christ, and teaching of us to love him in sincerity, which is the very joy and exultation of heaven, Rev. 5.12. Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receave power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing. And no other thing then the soul breathing forth love to Je∣sus Christ, can rightly apprehend the joyes of heaven. The last words which he spoke at supper, were in the commendation of Love above knowledge, saying, O but notions of Knowledge without Love, are of small worth, evanishing in nothing, and very dan∣gerous. After supper, his father having given thanks, he read the 16 Psalm, and his first words thereafter were, If there were any thing in the World sadly and unwillingly to be left, it were the reading of the Scriptures. I said I shall not see the Lord, even the
Lord, in the land of the living, but this needs not make us sad; for where we go, the Lamb is the book of Scripture, and the light of that City, and there is life, even the river of the water of life, and living springs. To this he added many excellent observations, and making mention of the 23 v. of the 31 Psal. O love the Lord, all ye his saints, he added, that where love was, it was so operative, that it made flesh, spirit; and where it was not, there spirit was made flesh: thereafter he sung a part of the same Psalm. Supper being ended, he cals smilingly for a pen, saying, it was to write his Testament, wherein he only ordered some few books, which he had, to be re∣delivered to several persons. He went to bed a litle after eleven of the clock, and having slept wel till 5 in the morning, he arose and called to his Camerade Iohn Wodrow, saying pleasantly, up Iohn; for you are too long in bed; you and I look not like men going this day to be hanged, seeing we lye so long. Thereafter he said to him in the words of Isaiah ch. 42. v. 24. Who gave Iacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the Lord? he against whom we have sinned, for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto His Law, &c. and I think, Iohn, (said he) I have not known it, nor do I lay it to heart, as it is't said in the end of the 25 verse. But, John (said he) for all this be not affraid, but read the 43. ch. v. 1.2. for all will go well with us. Iohn said to him, you and I will be chambered shortly in heaven, beside Mr Robertson. He answered, I fear, Iohn, you bar me out, because you was more free before the Council then I was; but I shall be as free as any of
you upon the Scaffold. Before break-fast. he said, he had got a clear ray of the Majesty of the Lord after his awaking, but it was a litle again over-cloud∣ed. Thereafter he prayed, and attested the Lord, that he had devoted himself to the service of God in the Ministry of the Lord Jesus, and the edification of souls, very early; adding albeit I have not been so with my God, yet thow hast made vvith me an Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure; this is all my desire, joy and salvation, albeit thovv make me not a house to grovv. Novv Lord, vve come to thy throne, a place vve have not been ac∣cquainted vvith; earthly King's thrones have dvo∣cats against poor men, but thy Throne hath Jesus, an Advocate for us. Our supplication this day, is not to be free of death, nor of pain in death, but that vve may vvitness before many vvitnesses, a good confession. His Father coming to him that morning to bid him arewel, his last words to him were, after prayer and a litle discourse, that his suffering vvould do more hurt to the Prelates, and be more edifying to God's people then if he vvere to continue in the Ministry, for tvventy years. And then he desired his Father to leave him, else he would but trouble him, & I desire it of you, said he, As the best and last service you can do me, to go to your chamber, and pray earnest∣ly to to the Lord to be vvith me on that Scaffold: for how to carry there is my care, even that I may be strengthened to endure to the end. About tvvo of the clock in the Afternoon, he vvas carried to the Scaffold vvith other five that suffered vvith him; vvhere he appeared to the conviction of all that formerly knevv him, vvith a fairer, better and
more stayed countenance then ever they had before ob∣served. Being come to the foot of the Ladder, he di∣rected his speech North-vvard to the multitude. And, premising, That as his Years in the VVorld had been but fevv, so his VVords at that time should not be many. He spoke to the People, the speech and Testimony vvhich he had before vvritten and subscribed. Having done speaking to the People, who heard him with great attention, he sung a part of the 31 Psal. and then prayed with such povver and fervency, as forced many to vveep bitterly. Having ended he gives his cloak and hat from him; And vvhen he turn∣ned himself and took hold of the Ladder to go up, he said vvith an audible voice, I care no more to go up this Ladder and over it, then if I were going home to my Fathers House; And as he went up, hearing a great noise amongst the People, he called dovvn to his fel∣lovv-sufferers, saying, Friends and Fellow-sufferers, be not affraid, every step of this Ladder is a degree nearer Heaven. Then having seated himself there∣on, he said, I do partly believe, that, the Nobles, Counsellors, and Rulers of the Land, would have used some mitigation of this punishment, had they not been instigated by the Prelates, so our blood lyes principally at the Prelats door. But this is my comfort now, that I know my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth, and though after my skin, worms destroy this Body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, vvhom I shall see for my self, and mine Eyes shall behold (pointing to his eyes) and not another,
though my reins be consumed in me. And novv I do vvillingly lay dovvn my life for the Truth and Cause of God, the Covenants and VVork of Reformation, vvhich vvere once counted the Glory of this Nation. And it is for endeavouring to defend this, and to extirpate that bitter root of Prelacy, that I embrace this rope (the Executioner putting the rope about his ncek.) Then hearing the People weep, he said, Your vvork is not to vveep, but to pray that vve may be honourably born through; and blessed be the Lord, that supports me. Novv as I have been beholden to the prayers and kind∣ness of many since my imprisonment and sentence; So I hope you vvill not be vvanting to me novv, in this last step of my journey, that I may vvitness a good Con∣fession: And that you may knovv the ground of my en∣couragement in this VVork, and vvhat my hope is, I vvill read to you the last Chapter of the Bible; And having read it, he said, Here you see the Glory that is to be revealed upon me, a pure river of vvater of life, and so forth (read the place) vvhere the Throne of God is, and the Lamb is in it, vvhere his Servants serve Him and see His face, and His Name is in their foreheads, and the Lord God giveth them light, and they shall reign for ever and ever; and here you see my access to my Glory and revvard. Let him that is a thirst come, and vvhosoever vvill let him take of the vvater of life freely. And here you see also my vvelcome, the Spirit and the Bride say, Come. Then he said, I have one vvord more to say to my Friends, (looking
dovvn to the Scaffold) vvhere are you? You need neither lament me nor be ashamed of me in this condi∣tion, for I may make use of that expression of Christs, I go to your Father and my Father, to your God and my God, to your King and my King, to the blessed A∣postles and Martyrs, and to the City of the Living God, the heavenly Ierusalem, to an innumerable company of Angels, to the General Assembly and Church of the First-born, and to God the Iudge of all, and to the Spirits of just men made perfect, and to Iesus the Me∣diator of the new Covenant; And so I bid you all fare∣vvell: For God vvill be more comfortable to you then I could be; And he vvill also novv be more refreshing to me, then you can be: farevvel, farevvel in the Lord. Then the Napkin being put on his face, he prayed a space vvithin himself, after vvhich he put up the cloath from his face, vvith his ovvn hand, and said, he had one vvord more to say, and that vvas to shevv them the comfort he had in his Death, saying, I hope you perceaved no alteration or discouragement in my countenance and carriage, and as it may be your vvonder, so I profess it is a vvonder to my self, and I vvill tell yovv the reason of it: Besides the justness of my Cause, this is my comfort, vvhich vvas said of Laza∣rus vvhen he dyed, that the Angels did carry his soul into Abraham's Bosom; so, that as there is a great solemnity here, of a confluence of People, a Scaffold, a Gallovvs, and People looking out at vvindovvs; so is there greater & more solemn preparation in Heaven,
of Angels to carry my soul to Christ's bosom. Again, this is my comfort, that it is to come in Christ's hands, and He vvill present it blameless and faultless to the Father, and then shall I be ever vvith the Lord. And novv I leave of to speak any more to creatures, and turn my speech to thee. O Lord! and novv I begin my enter∣course vvith God, vvhich shall never be broken off. Farewel Father and Mother, Friends and Relations; Farevvel the VVorld and all Delights, Farevvell meat and drink, Farevvel Sun, Moon and Stars; VVel∣come God and Father, VVelcome svveet Lord Iesus, the Mediator of the nevv Covenant, VVelcome blessed Spirit of Grace and God of all consolation, VVelcome Glory, VVelcome Eternal Life, VVelcome Death. Then he desired the Executioner not to turn him over, untill he should put over his ovvn shoulders himself, vvhich, after praying a little vvithin himself, he did, saying, O Lord! into thy hands I commit my Spirit: for thou hast redeemed my Soul, Lord God of truth. Thus in the 26 Year of his age, he died, as he lived, in the Lord. FINIS.
Some Instances of the Sufferings of Galloway and Ntthisdale. BEcause in the former Deduction, mention is made of a Paper containing some of the Sufferings of Galloway and Nithisdale▪ it is not inconvenient, for more Particular Information, to subjoyn a few in∣stances out of the same Paper. And first, at three several inroads which the Souldiers have made into that Countrey, in the Years 1663, 1665 and 1666. they exacted from the People there, for adhereing to their old faithful Ministers, and not sub∣mitting to the Ministry of those whom the Prelates vio∣lently obtruded upon them, the Summes of Money underwritten, viz.   Lib. S. d. From 49 Families in the Parish of Carsphairn, 4864 17 0 From 43 Families in the Parish of Dalray, 9577 16 8 From 49 Families in Balmaclelland, 6430 10 0 From 9 Families in Balmacghie, 425 11 8 From 2 or 3 Families in Tungland, 166 12 0 From some poor Persons in Tuynham, 81 4 0 From 20 Families in Borg, 2026 17 4 From 9 poor Families in Girton, 525 10 4 From some poor Families in Anwith, 733 6 4 From 34 inconsiderable Families in Kirkpatrick-Durham, 2235 6 0
From some few Fam. in Kirkmabrek, 563 6 0 From 3 Families in Monygaff, 600 0 0 From 18 Families in Kircudbright, 2580 0 0 From 37 poor Families in Lochruton, notwithstanding they wanted a Curate, 2080 0 0 From 12 poor Families in Traquair, 756 10 0 From Kells Parish, 466 13 4 From Corsemichall Parish, 1666 13 4 From 24 Families in Parton Parish, 2838 9 4 From 42 Families in Irongray, 3362 18 8 Summa 41982 12 0 In the Sheriffdom of Nithsdale or Dumfries-Shire. From 51 Families in the Town and Parish of Dumfries, 4617 15 4 From 20 poor Families in Kirkmahoe, 1341 6 6 From 14 Families in Dunscoir, 1411 13 4 In Glencairn Parish, 2146 14 8 Summa of Nithisdale 9517 9 10 Summa totalis 51500 2 10 And although these Summs (being Scots-money) may seem small to strangers, yet considering that they are not leavyed proportionally from all the People, but some select persons within these bounds, and that there
are 19 or 20 Parishes of which there is no ac∣count at all; and that the great expense of free quarter by the souldiers, in most of the Parishes abovenamed (which would amount to a great summ) is not included, and that severall persons have not as yet payed, but are to pay their Fines and Cess; and that severall of the poor people, through fear, at divers times have given bribes in money & other things to Officers & Souldiers, for keeping them free of Cess & Quartering (notwith∣standing whereof they were little or nothing the better) and that the Parliament before, arbitrarily and for no alleadged crime, had exacted by their Act of Fining, from 132 Persons within the said bounds, the summ of 77120 Pounds Scots Money; And that the Cess (besids free Quartering) levyed by the Souldiers, ac∣cording to the Commissioner's Order, for alleaged Defi∣ciency in Payment of the said Fines, extended to near as much as the Principal, Considering (I say) all these things, the Summs are very considerable, and much greater then could have been expected in so little bounds, and in a Countrey so poor and mountainous, and less fertill then many others in the Land. But the exacting of money was not all, but in effect a small part of their oppression: for the carriage of the souldiers in free quartering was very cruel, barbarous and inhumane, as will appear by these general aggrava∣tions and particular instances. Ordinarily in Quartering, they did not content them∣selves with sufficiency, but set themselves to consume and waste needlessly; sometimes throwing whole sheep to their dogs, and scattering corn, hay and straw, they and their boyes usually saying, we came to destroy, and we shall destroy yow. Ordinarily when they had consumed the Land∣lord,
they quartered upon the poor Tennants, and when they had consumed the Tennants, did fall upon the Land-lords, although they had conformed; as they did upon a Gentleman in Kirkmahoe. Frequently these who conformed from the beginn∣ing, and others who conformed of late, did no less suffer then these who conformed not at all; and some in severall Parishes, who had given all the obedience which was demanded, suffered more then these who gave none at all; yea conforming husbands have been Punished by Fine, Cess and quartering for their non∣conforming wives. It is also to be considered, that, besids all that the Countrey had thus suffered, the souldiers were again sent forth through the Countrey, and new Fines, Cess & Quarter were imposed upon the same persons and fa∣milies who had been fined before; yea, upon some it was doubled and tripled, so that some Yeomens were fined in 500 merks Scots besids their former fines. All which is the more considerable, that, although the Papists in that Countrey were very numerous, few of them were troubled, and these inconsiderable Persons, who were only fined in inconsiderable summs for the fashion. And particularly in the Parish of Balmaclelland, a poor widow with several fatherless children, after she had payed at severall times 320 merks, and suffered the Cess of 3 souldiers 17 dayes, coming to the Com∣mander of that Party to complain of some wrongs done unto her, in stead of access, she is mercilessly boasted down stairs. In the same Parish an old deaf man, after he had payed 52 rex-dallers, and then given bond for 350 pounds Scots, was so tossed, what by being brought
before the High Commission, and what by rude usage at home, that he contracted sickness and dyed; and thereafter his poor widow, having payed 120 pounds, was quartered upon many dayes, until she was forced to leave her house, and through cold and double grief contracted a deadly sickness. In the same Parish a poor man, having been quar∣tered upon and Payed 120 pounds Scots, was himself cast into prison, while 8 souldiers quartered upon him at home. In the same Parish, a Gentleman, who did ordinarly come to Church, was quartered upon by six souldier, notwithstanding that himself, his Lady and most part of his family were sick. In the same Parish a poor man being quartered upon 38 dayes, and having payed 48 pounds, and given bond for 150 pounds, though as is informed, he hath not so much as a free Cow, when he came to com∣plain, he was beaten by the Officer, and returning, was again beaten by the Souldiers. In the same Parish, a poor bed-rid man with his sick wife were necessitated to beg, until he gathered three pounds to give for his Fine or Cess. In the same Parish a very poor bed-rid creple man was forced to pay 50 merks. In the same Parish a very old honest man, who be∣ing reckoned past 80 years, and unable to work in his trad being a Coupar, and scarce having the worth of a groat of free goods, but the Countreyes charity, was forced to pay 20 pounds. In the Parish of Corsemichall, the souldiers being quartered in a house, having lest some broth of mut∣ton, did violently thrust away the hungry children from supping thereof, till first they set their dogs to leap it, and then did bid the children take what the dogs had left.
In the Parish of Parton, the souldiers, horse and foot, after they had quartered 15 weeks in a Gentleman's house, till they had eaten up the Provision wherewith he should have maintained his family, having five or six small children, they forced his wife and servants to the doors, after they had been their slaves and ser∣vants all that time, and then Possessed themselves ab∣solute masters of his whole houses, plenishings, cattell and what else was his within their reach; and when some good neighbours had receaved the little ones for shelter, with great difficulty could they obtain one milk Cow of twelve belonging to their Father, for supply of the children. Nota. This Gentleman seems to be utterly broken, and hes been severall times imprisoned and miserably tossed up and down. In the Parish of Borg, in a Gentlemans house, the souldiers did quarter for 15 weeks, till they consumed the whole provision of the Family, which was well furnished with meal and malt and other necessaries; they also destroyed the whole plenishing (except one table which they left in case they came again) even to the pulling down of the Partition-wall of the main dwelling house, and pulling down of an Office-house without the gate: All this destruction they committed by giving and selling one part within the Countrey, and sending another part to Glasgow, and breaking and burning the rest of it, of purpose that it might be useless for the owner, who was forced to flee before, & betake himself to wandering with his brother and their families. And after they had committed all this vastation, they also fell upon their Tennants, and forced them to bring in malt, sheep, fowls, and other things (for their maintenance) that they pleased to call for, and so ruined them also; And two of his
Tennants they forced to scatter their families, having threatened to burn their houses, besids all the de∣struction they had done to their Master and them be∣fore. In the Parish of Irongray, a poor Tennant having bar∣gained with the Souldiers, to redeem his goods for 36 pounds, when he came to Dumfris, they would hardly take 50 pounds, so that he was forced to bor∣row the over-plus. and being returned home to shear his corns, and expecting no more trouble from them, they came back upon him, and took away his beasts and all, even to the leading away of his hay. The like was practised upon another in the same Parish. And further, some Maintenance imposed in the year 1648, being alleaged unpayed by severall Gentle∣men and others within the Sheriffdom of Nithisdale, let∣ters of horning were raised by the Collectors; which let∣ters and executions thereof were suspended, because the same was already payed, and yet notwithstanding, Troopers were sent to Cess and Quarter upon the said persons, till they should make payment, although the suspension was not discussed; and several of them, to be releeved of the heavy burthen of the Cess & quar∣tering, were constrained to make payment thereof, and that by and attour the Cess for the same, which was far above the said maintenance, in so much that a Gentleman who at first might have payed for 30 pounds, the Party that went to Cess upon him would not aggree to remove for less then 200 merks, Yea af∣ter an order was procured from the Commissioner, for removing the Cess for the said Maintenance, a party of 8 or 9 horsmen, with their boyes and horses, were sent once and again to quarter upon some Gentlemen,
until they were forced to make a new address to the Commissioner for removal thereof. By all which, that Countrey was so exhausted of money, that neither poor nor rich could get it to satisfy these men's demands, and the poor people were forc∣ed to sell their beasts in the Merkets below their worth; in so much that they were forced to sell a Cow for two Nobles or two Crowns, the soul∣diers in the mean time standing by to receave the same, although the poor men had destitute families at home: Yea many families whose summs are not here reckoned, in probability are totally ruined, and many others scattered, and particularly in Lochrutton there are above 16 families broken, in Irongray the most part of the families are broken, beside seve∣ral that are already put from house-keeping, the souldiers having taken away, both there and elsewhere, that which the People should have lived upon; yea several Gentlemen, formerly in good condition, were put from house-keeping, and forced to wander, and be beholden to others for a nights lodging, the soul∣diers having violently possessed themselves of their barns, cattel and other goods. Neither is this all, the wickedness, prophanity and blasphemies of the souldiers, are rather to be ab∣horred and supprest then thought or spoken of, if the notoriety thereof were not universall in these bounds. In the Parish of Carsphairn, in an Inn at the Bridge of Deugh, on the Sabbath-day, some of them being quar∣tered there, they most profanely and atheistically mocked at all preaching of the Gospel, saying, let us go preach, and then read their text out of the Cherry and the Slae (an old Scotch Amorous Poem) counterfeit∣ing
a form of divine worship, and as it is informed did sing an other part of the same Poem in stead of the Psalms, and used all other mocking modes, as if they had been serious at Gods worship. In the Parish of Irongray, an honest man retiring himself to the fields for secret prayer (not having li∣berty at home) was followed by the Souldiers, who drew swords upon him threatning to kill him, if they heard him praying any more, saying, Sir, we have heard yow many times howling, if we hear yow again, &c. Another time in that same Parish, the Master of the house was exhorting them to leave off their swearing and profanity, showing them the danger and hazard they were in of the condemnation of Hell, some of the souldiours mocking at hell most blasphemously an∣swered. By my soul ere I go to hell, it shall cost God 24 hours pains ere he get me there. In the Town of Kircudbright, when one Captain Fin an horseman died, one of his Camerads coming to see him, and finding him dead, came near and rudely gripping the dead man, used this horrid expres∣sion, what, divell art thow dead, man? and did not tell me before, that I might have sent a letter to hell with thee (to such a camerade of his as he named, who had died lately before) to take up my winter quarters. In the same Town also, as is informed, some of them conveening at the Cross, & drinking there healths, one of them personating... (Who dare express whom) used this blasphemous expression to his Camerads, Ye are my Angels, and I drink to you all. But we abhorre to men∣tion any more of this sort: only this is certain, that Atheism and Blasphemy is become so ordinary with them, that some of themselves are forced to regret it.
In the Parish of Carsphairn, some of the foot soul∣diers did so barbarously and cruelly struggle with a man's wife to have forced her (till she was rescued out of their hands by some women) that she for fear parted with child, and keeped her bed half a year, being near unto death, and little hope of recovery. Also in a Gentleman's house in the same Parish, where they were quartered, they cruelly beat some of the servants to the effusion of their blood, for all the good service they had done them, POSTSCRIPT. BY these things, which have been done in Galloway and Nithisdale, as the Reader may compute, what vast sus∣ferings and horrid abominations must be in the whole Land, many places whereof are no less disaffected to Prelacy, when there are so many and gross, in so little bounds and so short time; so he may preceave, what provocation that poor oppressed people had to endeavour their own preservation, and to take hold of any opportunity for vindicating their religious and civil Interests: and what reason others, either in the same condition with them, or upon the common ground of Non-conformity, being threatened and justly fearing to be shortly reduced thereunto, had, according to their obligation in the Covenant, for mutual defence and assistance in the common cause of Religion and Liberty, to joyn with them for their help. Neither should I have adventured to insert these instances, if (besids the dili∣gent care that was used in collecting of them, making them credible; the notoriety thereof, whereby they were un∣questioned in that part of the Countrey; and many such∣like things (whereunto all that is mentioned, is but like a preface) committed since Novemb. 1666, especially in
the Western parts, rendering them probable) they were not the native product of this Prelatical course, betwixt which and them there is such connexion, as is betwixt the natural cause and the effect, and if the committers thereof had not had command, example and encouragement for many of them from the Prelats, whom they resemble as much as face answereth to face in water. It is true the Pre∣lats should no more bear all the blame, then Sathan (who restraineth none but tempteth to all) should be charged with all the Sin of man, and they were and are first and chief in the transgression, who were their Authors and are their upholders and abettors, and in retaliation of their flattery of the Powers, and connivance at profanness in all, and in subserviency to their interest and designe, have perpetrated and permitted so much wickedness and op∣pression; Yea the Peoples walking willingly after the com∣mandement, will never Excuse those, who by Law, Force & Example make Israel to Sin: yet it is above contradiction, that Prelacy is the chief though not the only Interest, in subserviency to which all these things are done; and the Prelats themselves are a conjunct if not the Principal cause thereof. These men having put off their former vizards, no man needeth further to unmask them. Let these who employed and maintained Sharp to agent their cause, and others who promoted him to the Prelacy, declare their own Experience, of his continued series of ungrate deceaving and undermining of them and their Interests, under Trust and professions to the contrary, as all men know that he hath Impiously and Perfidiously betrayed the Church and Cause of God: if they will not, Let his own many letters written unto them, be produced, as in reason and for Vindication they should, and they will evince him to be the Archest Traitor that ever Scotland bred: And how can it other∣wise be? will he who is false to God, be true to any man? If that man escape some stupenduous and disgracefull remark
by the hand of God or Man, I will not say, that Others need neither fear the One nor regard the other, but sure I am, that many more Experienced in the observation of divine Providence; and forseing then I am, are much mistaken. Let the City of Glasglow, and persons of all Qualities, especially in that countrey-side, ingenuously say, whether that fiery Zelot for the height of English Hierar∣chy and Ceremonies, and otherwise insignificant man, Master Burnet prelate there, doth nor, in Just recompence of too many their enslaving their own light and conscience, in flattery of him, and complying with that course, most insolently domineer over them as his slaves, with as much Prid, Ambition, and Contempt, as the most absolute Prince doth over his vassals. Let these of the Synod of Glasgow remember, with what deep dissimulation Mr Ha∣milton prelat of Galloway, did by Express suffrage declare, before the last Synod there, against the same Prelacy, which at that same instant of time, he was clandestinly cor∣responding with the Rulers to establish. This man of all others, hath been the chief Cause of all the Oppression and persecution in that countrey, and thereby the Occasion of the late riseing in Armes, & blood that hath followed there∣upon. One instance of Mr Honeyman prelate of Orkney I cannot ommit, that in the year 1661, when Mr Sharp had discovered himself, walking in his own garden, he said to a famous person who can bear witness thereof, (Just as Balaam spake truth whether he would or not) That Mr Sharp was as false as Iudas, and I would gladly know, to whom this Casuist, who since hath embraced a Bishoprick, will Compare himself for fals-hood, except to him who en∣tered into Iudas with the sop. I need tell no man who knoweth the Persons, of the brutish Sensuality of Mr Wal∣lace P. of the Isles, who studieth more the filling of his belly then he was ever fit for feeding of a flock; nor of the hatred of Godliness and good men in Mr Guthrey P. of Dunkel
who while he was Minister at Sterlin, was an old persecuter of both; nor the scandalous drinking of Mr Sraughan P. of Bre∣chen, let those who visite him in his own house, declare how liberally he useth to entertain them with Wine there, upon their own Expence. It is true indeed, that Mr Lighton prelate of Dumblan, under a Jesuitial-like vizard of Pretended Ho∣liness, humility, & crucifixion to the world, hath studied to seem to Creep upon the ground, but alwayes up the hill, to∣ward promotion & places of more ease, honor & Wealth; & as there is none of them all hath with a Kiss so betrayed the Cause, and smiten Religion under the fifth rib, and hath been such an offence to the godly, so there is none who by his way, practice and Expressions, giveth greater suspicion of a popish affection, inclination and design. If these men had not put off their own vaile, no pencil of the most skilled artist could have drawn them to the life, but now by shew∣ing of themselves, they have saved others a labour, or at least made it more easy. And therefore I shall rake no more into this unpleasant dung-hil of the vilest vice, which they and their Brethren in Iniquity (whom not nameing here doth not Except from their part of the charg of Ambition, Prid, Sensuality, Idleness, Covetousness, Oppression, Persecution, Dissimulation, Perjury, Treacheiy, and Hatred of Godliness and Good men,) have heaped together in their own Persons, and transsused to others over all the Land. O the Immense long suffering and unsearchable Wisedome of God! who, hearing the cry of these things, stirreth not the Zeal of all to Execute his just Judgment upon these men; but it may be, that he is ripening and reserving them, for a more God-like strok, then any would be acknowledged to be, wherein man were Instrumental. Neither are their Mercenaries, whom they hire as Postillions to ride upon the fore-horse of all their Wickedness, less skilled, but more foreward that way then their drivers. It were as far above the faith of any, who have not heard and seen, to beleeve,
and might render any pen suspected of the want of truth or tenderness, to write the Hundreth part, as it it easy to in∣stance incredibly much, but endless to relate all that is true of the Ignorance, Lightness & Profaness of these men. When I have told, that several lying in known and acknowledged fornication, without removall of the scandal, have been ad∣mitted to the Ministry by the Prelats who knew it, and violently obtruded by them & the Patrons upon the offend∣ed people; That some of them after Admission, have been deprehended lying with women by the way side; that Others have been found guilty of Actuall fornication, and of unanswerable presumptions of Adultery with other mens wives; and that drounkenness is both open and fre∣quent amongst many of them, I may well awake the wonder, the blush and horrour of the reader, but I have only be∣gun to shew a part (& indeed avery small part) of these mens wayes. A Prophet he may be by way of prognostication, but let the world Judg what manner of Preacher he must be, who, offending that the people did not come to hear him, did, before the Congregation, Imprecate thus against him∣self, God nor I be hanged hut I shall make you all come. Ano∣ther refused to pay the price of a horse before he pleased, (which he used to boast privately would be at Doomsday) because the seller, at the making of the bargan, in Civility said, Pay me when ye please; and thereupon, to the scorn and derision of all, substained an action of Law some dayes before a Civill Court. Who will commerce with such horse-koopers? but much less who can acknowledg such men for Ministers? These men, being themselves general∣ly without substance and forme of Religion, are such mali∣cious persecuters of both in Others, that as I could never hear of one soul turned from Sathan to God by their labours (whereof indeed there are many profane seals) so they are become vile in the eyes of all, that are truly godly or but morally civil; In so much that this is the only advantage,
(and indeed it is an advantage, for if they were more smooth and sober, they might be more insnaring) that they do not wear a rough garment to deceave; and though I cannot say, that their out-side is as unclean as their inner-side, yet it is such as saith in every mans heart, that the fear of God is not before their eyes. These are the pleasant birds, that are hatched and cherished under the warm wings of Prelacy, of whom though no man can speak the half of the truth to a stranger, without exposing himself to the Censure of partiali∣ty, Passion or being a Reproacher; yet the Universall and incontroverted Notoriety of these things, in all places where they reside or converse, will absolve the relater be∣fore all men who know them. It is true, we do not charg every individuall with every particular, yet because they are generally true of Many, and being notourly knows and sometimes represented are not remeeded, they are charg∣able upon the Course, which being Sinfull in self, the Authors and Abettors thereof are participant of the guilt, and lyable to the punishment. And indeed the Lord hath already begun his controversy with some of them, not only by pouring shame and Contempt upon them (particularly upon Traiterous Sharp) and drying up the Right eye & blast∣ing the gifts which severall seemed to have (whether by their own negligence, which every man observeth, or Imme∣diat judgment, or both, I do not determine,) but also by vi∣sible cursing of their substance, diverse of them being ne∣cessitated through poverty to sell their tithes at half worth, long before they are payable, and others of them to re∣move, leaving more debt behind, then they are able to discharge. Neither have these men thus profaned the sanctua∣ry only, & by the sins of the Sons of Ely made all men to abhor the offering of the Lord; but from them are issued forth, such overflowing streames of wickedness over all the Land, that, besids all that is mentioned, there are other inconceavable & inexpressible Atheistical abominations said to be committed
by men, which, as it is a Wonder the Devil himself should dare to act, so for fear of the great and dreadful God, and of offending the ears of others, my heart trembleth to think, & my hand faileth to writ. O Lord forgive, that ever ano∣thers speaking, but much more Acting, should have occa∣sioned my Thinking thereof. And yet as if all that is related were too little, for sanctu∣ary to themselves, for further inslaving of the Countrey, & venting of insatiable revenge (cursed be their anger for it is fierce, and their wrath for it is cruell) they have procured two Proclamations, dated at Edinburgh March. 25. 1667. making mention of great evidence of many disaffected Per∣sons in the Western Shares, who are ready to break out in open Re∣bellion, & involve the Kingdom in blood; & of just reason of suspition that these Rebells will rise in Armes against the King and his Authority, and not only make use of the Armes, Pow∣der and Ammunition concealed or transported from Enemies, but sese upon the Armes of others, and invade the Ministers of the Gospel &c. And therefore for preventing and disabling of them to put themselves in Military posture, to make sudden marches or attempts upon other Subjects or the standing Forces, or to joine with other persons of Pernicious And disloyal principles, &c. commanding all persons within the Shires of Lanerk, Air, Renfrew, Wigton and Stewarty of Kiredbright, who have refused or deserted publick trust, who withdraw from publick Ordinances, and keep not their Parish-Churches, or do not submit to the present Government of the Church, and all who being warned did not joine to suppress the late Rebellion, unless they take the Oath of Alleageance, and subscribe the Declara∣tion, that after the 15 day of May next, by themselves or any other for their behoof, they do not keep any horse above the va∣lue of an hundred merks; and in case of failzie, that the Sherif value & deliver such horses to the Informer without payment to be made therefore; and before the first of May, to deliver to their respective Sherifs all their Armes and Ammunition (allowing
Gentlemen only swords) under the pain of fining each Gentle∣man in 2000 merks, & each other person in 500 merks, where∣of the one half to the Informer; and commanding all Heri∣tors and Parishioners to defend the persons, families, and goods of their Ministers, from all affronts and injuries, with certifi∣cation that the sufferers and not opposers of the same, shall be reputed art & part, & he proceeded against with all rigor as guil∣ty thereof; and in case of surprizal, that they pursue, appre∣hend and present the committers before the Council, otherwise to be lyable to reparation of damnage, &c. What new and strange Policy is there here, that the Narrative of both Proclama∣tions, in stead of concealing in the time of declared and con∣tinued War with Forrainers, should proclaime that there are so many disaffected persons, who are ready to rise in Armes, to seise upon the Armes of others, and weaken the Forces of the Kingdom, thereby expressing the sense of their own de∣servings, and the fears of an evil conscience, discovering their own nakedness to enemies, and encouraging Forrain∣ers to invade with the more confidence? Must these Shires, which, without derogation to others, do eminently flourish with men of Piety towards God and true Loalty, and during the King's Exile, did retain a more faithful remem∣brance of his Interest according to the Covenants, then ma∣ny other places of the Kingdom, be, of all other Shires with∣in the same in recompense thereof, rewarded with the Ti∣tles of disaffected persons, Rebells, men of pernicious and dis∣loyal principles, and spoiled of their goods? Whence should these, who being spoiled of all Armes, first by the English, and then by the Council since the King's return, be presumed to have concealed Armes! What ground is there to suggest unto the World, the transportation of Armes from Ene∣mies? Must every man who will not throw away for no∣thing his Horse and Armes, which he hath purchased by his money, be therefore a seditious and disaffected person, and accordingly proceeded against with all rigor▪ If none with∣in
these Shires must keep a horse exceeding the value above-mention∣ed, how impossible is it to labour much of the ground? How are covetous wretches, in hope of gaining horse without Payment, and the half of the Fines for concealed Armes, animated to give in invi∣dious Informations against the owners? and many poor well mean∣ing people tempted, to redeem their beasts at the rate of Perjury and breach of Covenant? What an absurd thing is it, to punish men o∣therwayes innocent, only for not accepting or deserting publick trust; whereunto they neither have access, nor can continue in without for∣mal and express Perjury? How irrational and unjust is it, to command (under a penalty) Parishioners to do that which may be impossible, yea without the compass of their knowledge, such as opposing, but much more apprehending and presenting surprizers? wherewith, I pray you, shall these who must deliver up all their Armes (reserving not so much as a sword) defend themselves or any other man, against vio∣lence and surprizall? We read in our History of a Law, whereby for repressing of Theft, men were not to shut their doors in the night, and satisfaction was ensured to the owner for any thing that should be stoln from him; whereupon a Countrey-man alleaging his goods to be stoln, obtained payment; but being found thereafter that himself had hid them, he was hanged for a reward to himself and example to others: Now what if some of these covetous and malicious Men should (for who can rationally promise and secure, but that they who have done worse, may also) thus abstract or cause abstract their own goods? what if the Lord should immediatly smit them for offering strange fire? or thieves and robers should fall upon them? or evil Spi∣rits in humane shape▪ should haunt or hurt them, must Innocent people upon their invidious & false alleagance be therefore punished? As if the Parishioners of Carpha should pay for Mckinney's silver plate, which his own servant stole from him. Ah Scotland, which the Lord planted a noble vine, wholly a right seed! how are thow turned into a degenerate plant of a Strange Vine? Where is now the Spirit of the Fathers, that (as if thy inhabitants were neither Christians; Men nor Patriots) Religion, the Land, Ourselv∣es, and the Posterity, in Bodies, Consciences, and Estats should be thus emancipated, to the Interest, Lust and Designe of 14 Prelats and their Hirelings, whom the Lords sparing is a greater wonder, then if he should convert them into Pillars of salt for their Apostacy: O Backslide Scotland! remember from whence thow art fallen, Repent and Do the First works, or else he will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestcik out of his place, except thow Repent. FINIS.
