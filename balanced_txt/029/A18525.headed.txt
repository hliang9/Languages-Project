¶ That holy men & gode men ben more tempted than other / and how our lorde playeth with his childer by ensāple of the moder & hir chyl¦de / and what Joye & myrthe is in our lordes presence / Caplo j. UIgilate et orate vt nō intretis in temp∣tacionē. Wakyth & prayeth that ye entre not in to temptacōn Thise ben the wordes of our lorde Ihesu cryste. the whiche nede none other declaracōn than the same vn¦derstondyng of theselfe wordes Therfore I leue diuysions of ma∣ters / playnly to write as god will gyue me grace somwhat of temp∣tacōns / & of remedye again hem. to your ghostly comforte / Take now thēne good hede of thise holy wor∣des / ¶ Wakyth & prayeth that ye falle not in to temptacōn / Ye shal vnderstōde / contynuell & besy pray¦er: whan he sayth / wakyth & pray∣eth / & whan he saythe / that ye entre not in to temptacōn. ye shal vnder¦stōde that ye be not ouercome with temptacōn / Thus haue ye thenne by the techyng of our lorde a speci¦all remedye agayn al temptacōns & that is besie prayer / Prayeth thē¦ne besely in all tyme of nede / But now to our purpos take hede what our lorde saith. He sayth not pray¦eth that ye be not tempted / but he sa∣yth that ye falle not in temptacion That good lorde knoweth wel by his grace & ordenaūce how prouffi¦table it is to good men & wymen moche to be tempted & to be trow∣blid. ye semyth by his wordes why∣che he spekyth by the prophete to a man or to a woman that is trow¦bled / I am wyth him in his tribu¦lacyon / I shall deliuer him. and I shall glorifye him. Of this we ha¦ue ensāple of our holy faders why¦che greuously were tempted. as ye shall here after. and among all of our glorious lady whiche passed all other in holynes & moost was troubled / therfore he is disceyued ye wenyth he be holy for he is not tēp∣ted / For soth it is to good men & wymen that traueyle to be perfygh¦te ben more tēpted than other why¦che be recheles of liuynge. And a cause why is / for a moūtayne the hyer he is there is the gretter wyn¦de / In the same manere the hyer a mannes liuyng is the strenger is the temptacōn of his goostly en∣mye / Wherfore yf men or wymen of religyon or of ony perfeccyon fe¦le noo temptacōns thenne oughte they sorest to drede / for thenne they ben moost tempted whan they fele hem not tempted / therfore sayth sa¦ynt gregory / Thenne art thou mo¦ost assaylled whan thou felest the not assayled / Also whan our lord
suffreth vs be tempted in our begi¦nynge. he playeth wyth vs as the moder wyth the chylde. whiche som¦tyme fleeth away & hideth her / & suf¦freth the chylde to wepe & crye: & be¦sely to seke hir wyth sobbyng & we pyng. but then̄e cometh the moder sodenly wyth mery chere & laughi∣ge beclippyng her chylde & kyssyng & wipeth away the teres. Thus fa¦reth our lorde wyth vs. as for a ty¦me he wythdraweth his grace & cō¦fort fro vs / In somoche that in his absence we ben al colde & drye / swet¦nesse haue we none ne sauour in deuocyon / Slowe we ben to pray¦er or to traueyle / the wretchyd sow¦le sodenly is chaūged & made full heuy & ful of sorowe & care Then̄e is the body sluggy & the herte full harde And all our spirytes so dul¦le. that the lif of our body is to vs noyous. All that we here or see thouh it be gode yet for the tyme it is not. And soth for to say / wery be we then̄e of goodnes / & like for to falle in to vices: & feble to withstō¦de temptacōns Suche heuynes we finde in absence of our fader / And yet our fader leuyth vs neuertheles¦se / but hideth him for a tyme & play¦eth wyth vs for grete loue / Thys absence & forsakyng for a tyme the prophete vnderstode well whan he sayd. Lorde forsake me not at all tymes / therfore vpō thyse wordes sayth saynt gregory. he knew we ye he sholde be forsake but for a whi¦le / that asked to be forsake not at all tymes / The presence of our lor¦de / I clepe his gracyous werkyng in vs. And I clepe his absence the wythdrawēg of his comfortes fro vs. But now some man that re∣deth this / perauenture wylle saye this is a straunge playe / what is this play that thus heui we ben of the absence of our lord / The playe of loue is Joye & sorowe whiche to come diuers tymes one after a no¦ther by the presence & by the absen¦ce of hym that is our loue. this is a properte of loue / that whan we haue hym presente whom we loue we knowe not how moche we lo∣ue. But whan he is away / thenne we perceyue by his absence what mater we haue to loue him The ioy of his presence causeth sorowe in his absence / not soo that he is cau∣se of sorowe / But for his presence is to vs so Joyfull. that wyth his absence we must nedes be sorow∣full: ¶ I haue rehersed here short∣ly what manere of sorowe we ha∣ue in absence. For ye shall haue it more openly after But sayth now what Joy comyth & matere of Joy by his blessyd presence. Anone at his comyng the soule wexeth ligh¦te & Joyfull / the conscyence is cle∣re and moche in reste. the spirytes
that were dull & dede ben quicke / & redy to traueylle / and all thyng yt was harde & sharpe. & Impossible to semyng. anone they wexe softe & swete. and all maner of exercyse in fastyng & in wakyng & all go∣de werkes of suche exercyse is tor∣ned in to mirth for grete desire & lo¦ue / The soule is fyllid wyth chary¦te & all maner of clennes / She is fedde wyth suche ghostly swetnesse that for suche grete likyng in ghos¦tly fedyng / all outwarde thynges ben almost forgoten Then̄e cometh soo mery meditacōns wyth plente of teres of cōpascyon / teres of cō∣pūccion / teres of loue / & of deuocy¦on / and though there comen no te¦res there come other vysitacōns yt passen all worldly myrth / and ther¦wyth so grete plente of grace / that what is askyd it is grauted / what is. sought is foūde / and the yate of grace is opened to al that aske thē¦ne to entree / ¶ By thise tokens whiche I haue rehersed / we mow well fele & know the presence & the absence of our lorde. Therfore that he wythdrawe hym not for yowre owne defawte. wakyth & prayeth that ye falle not in to temptacōn / ¶ Vigilate et orate / & c̄. ¶ Of vj. pryncypal causes why our lorde wythdraweth his comfor¦tes fro his chyldern / and of dyuer∣se maner of ghostly affecciōs whi¦che somtyme ben wythdrawen for grete necligence and vnkyndnes Caplm / ij. WHy our lorde withdraweth him fro some more than fro some / why he vysiteth some more than some. we maye not pla¦ynly determyn. But some causes of his wythdraweng I wyll shew now / or I wryte ferder more of o∣ny matere / and after that I wylle shewe remedyes to gete agayn hys presence / One cause maye be that the louer sholde falle not by pryde: For many ryche gyftes & gladnes of chere / whiche ben gyuen & shew∣ed by the presence of our lorde whe¦che sholde be our loue. The seconde cause may be that we shlde know our owne Infirmyte / and that is full prouffytable. for as saynt gre¦gory sayth / It is a grete refeccōn a man to see & knowe his owne Im¦perfeccyon / The thyrde cause is for man sholde not holde hymselfe siker For grete trust of sikernes engen¦dreth necligence & presūpcion / and those two togyder inobedyēce / The fourth canse is that we sholde the more besely seke hym / wepe and crye after hym / as the chylde after the moder / The fyfth cause is that we sholde receyue his comyng af∣ter his wythdrawyng wyth more Joye & gladnesse / The sixte cause is that the sholde be the more wyse
and the more stronge to kepe hym Whan we haue hym All thise cau¦ses of wythdrawynge ben but for our prouffyte after goddes ordena¦unce / But other causes there may. be for our owne defawtes / somty¦me for necligence / & somtyme for vnkūnyng vnkyndnes: Therfore this cause of wythdrawēg I wyll declare in partie / for Itrow it be spe defull to men & wymen in her begi¦nyng to knowe of this matere whā they fele swetnes or deuocōn in ghostly liuyng. After the sayen¦ge of the phylosophers: Whan ye see the son̄e is hye in the mydse of may / thēne hath the sonne dowble vertue of werkyng in trees herbes & all thyng that is growyng. yf ye planetes then̄e whiche gouerne the nature be well ordeyned / after that the tyme of the yere askith / Then̄e draweth the son̄e the humours vp in to the ayre / of the whiche comen dewe & rayne wherby the fruyte of the erthe prouffyteth / & is multepli¦ed. ¶ Now to our purpose / in the same maner̄ / whan that clere sone our lorde Ihesu is lifte vp in oure hertes aboue all other thynges of our kynde / thenne yf bodely dysposi¦cyon be well ruled after dyscrecōn Yf vertues. whiche I clepe ghostly humours ben enhabyted by longe exercyse. whyche vertues shall be presented wyth thankynges / and worshyppes to that clere sonne ihe¦su / Then̄e somtyme of al thise ver¦tues cometh a swete rayn of an in¦warde beholdynge. and an heuenly dewe of the swetnes of the godhe∣de. This is a specyall werkyng of our lorde Ihu cryst in hertes of his louers / And in all his louyd chyl¦dern. of this heuēli swetnes cometh suche a likyng to the herte & to all the body. that it semeth a man In∣wardly / that fully he is beclipped wyth the loue of god / This likyn¦ge is more delectable to the body. & soule than all the myrthe & likyng that all the worlde myghte gyue for the tyme: In this likynge god sendeth in to the herte soo grete sa∣uours / comfortes. by gyftes of gla¦dnes. that it thinketh for the tyme he is fulfullid wyth gyftes of gos¦tly comfort / And of this comith a ghostly dronken̄es. whiche falleth to dyuers mē in many dyuers ma¦ners / This maner dronkenes ma¦kyth some men singe & worshyppe god for fulfylling of gladnes / Some men in that tyme stirynge wyth all the membres of her body soo that they must skyppe or ren̄e or daunce / Some for Joye bete her hondes togyder / Some crye lowde wyth an hye woys / Some ben stil¦le & maye not speke. Somtyme se∣meth hem that al the worlde faren as they done. And some haue wō∣der
that alle the worlde fareth not as they done / Hem thynken ofty∣mes that they maye neuer forgoo the likyng that they haue / Some men that haue suche likyng won∣dren what hem eilen. and what thī¦ge it maye be that makyth hem soo mery & Joyfull. Somtyme it hap¦peth this likyng is soo grete / that it semyth to some man that his her¦te sholde breke for Joye / Suche ma¦ner̄ werkīg ged wrouht oftymes to men & wymen in her fyrst begin¦nyng / whan they drewe to ghostli liuyng. and whan they torned hem holy to god / whan they forsoke all worldly comforte. and put her hope fully in god / And yet for all thys they ben right tender as chylderne that nede mylke & softe mete & swe¦te / For harde metes & sowre they may not suffre / that is to say they may not suffre noo stronge temp∣tacōns For they may not ne cūne not suffre easely the absence of ou¦re lorde / For whan they ben forsa∣ke alityll / that is to say. whan likī¦ge & comforte is wythdrawen for a tyme / Anone they ben grutchyn¦ge. and falle thēne in to suche heuy¦nes / that for defawte of knowing how thei shold haue hem in his pre¦sence / thei ben soo necligent in his absēce. that some tyme they leue of moche of her traueyle / by cause they haue no likyng / Here is a gre¦te vnkindnes / and for vnkindnes¦se grace is oft wythdrawen / But this vnkyndnes is caused of vn∣cūnyng Yet for it is god to know how we sholde haue vs in his pre∣sence / yt for our vnkīdnes we cau¦se not his absence / Also how we sholde haue vs in his absence that for ony slouth or necligēce we lese not his presence / Of this matere somwhat shortly I wylle weyte & shewe some shorte remedye to haue ayē our loue whā he is wythdraw But yet leest yt ye lese him in your owne defawte / wakyth & prayeth that ye falle not in to temptacōn / ¶ Vigilate et orate & c̄. ¶ How a man shal haue hym in receyuīg of grace & ghostly vysita∣cōns & how some bē begyled wyth a fals swetnes / whan they bē vysi¦ted wyth ony suche cōfortes iij. HOw we sholde know ye pre¦sence of our lorde Ihu. I ha∣ue reherced before but some for vncūnynge of receyuīg of his yefte & al suche gostly cōfortes we¦ne yt they receyue hem by her owne merites / & that they deserue hem for her owne traueyle / This is a foule blindnes: whiche letteth & dystroy∣eth ye floures / & the frutes of al go¦ostly vertues / ne here is noo loue shewed to him yt mynistreth al ma¦ter of loue & what he be yt thinkith thus / he hath him not dewely in the

Whā the sonne in tyme of yere begyn̄eth to wythdrawe doūwarde / then̄e re igneth he in a planete that we call Virgyne. and the cause why it is callid virgyne is for that tyme of the yere it is not fructuous nomo¦re than a mayde yt bereth no fruyte of children / In this tyme of the ye¦re / the hete of the wheder is mynys∣shed. harde frute corne & wyne ben gadered home: And thenne is some seedes sowen to prouffyte of man: Als the werkynge

They haue also grete in¦firmytees in body & in soule / Som̄ falle in perplexitees for a thyng ye nought is to charge or lityl And there they cowde coūseyle other. in that & other doubtes / thēne stōdeth hymself desolate & in grete doubte / Some ben soo harde preuyd with goostly temptacyons / whyche pas¦sen all dyseases. that what for dre¦de & doubte / all comforte is lost / sa∣uf oonly hope of mercy / Of suche goostly temptacōns & trybulacy∣ons ye shall see more openly after¦warde / ¶ A good god what gra∣ce is in thy presence / how precious is thy loue / Whan all loue & gra∣ce fayleth in thyne absence / Now thenne it were gode to know how a man sholde bere hym in alle this sorowfull mornyng. Fyrst I coū∣seyle euery mā to thinke or put it to his owne defawte that grace is
wythdrawe by some maner̄ necly∣gence / or specyall defawte by dysso¦lute bering / or for withdrawēg the hert from god by diuers vayn tho¦ughtes. & though his conscyēce de∣me not this alway in specyall / yet good it is to drede / & as openly as he can oft declare his conscyēce to his goostly fader / In specyall yf he can. or elles in generall wordes. And this is a souerayn medicyn to al temptacōns Also he shal not leue his traueyle for noo maner̄ he¦uynes / for your prayer sauour not as at that tyme / It is accept full hye to god. & turneth perauēture to more mede. than though he vysited wyth likynge & swetnes: And yet I will not coūseyle that he kepe al∣way the same tyme of prayer / for somtyme it is spedeful to leue it for good entent / For what occupaciō it be / prayer or meditacōn. redyng writyng / or elles good comenyng or what thyng it be / that most ste∣ryth hym to the loue of god / that I holde spedefull to vse / as for that ty¦me / for that dryueth away heuynes¦se / & comforteth the soule / Also it is nedeful in all suche tyme to take bo¦dely sustenaūce / & other nedeful res¦te in resonable maner̄ / & soo the sou¦le may be too wblid that hit is nede that he take a soppe in ale or in wi¦ne before mete. and after for com∣forte of the spyrites to be the more stronge ayenst heuy temptacyons. Also is is good to suche men and wymen to visite seke folke that bē holden goostly lyuers. and wyth al meknes commende hem to her pray¦ers. and yf nede be aske hem of her counseyle. ¶ Also for lowenes it is a nother remedye a man in su∣che dysease sette hymselfe at nough¦te / and thynke in his herte that no¦ught he hath / nought he had. ne no¦ughte may haue. but oonly of god and after ensample of Job he may thenne saye or thynke / Our lorde hath yeuen / our lorde hath taken a¦waye / as it pleyseth our lorde soo it is doo / blessid be the name of our lorde god / ¶ Sn̄s dedit dn̄s abs¦tulit sicut dn̄o placuit ita factum est sit nomen dn̄i bn̄dietū.

And though the wylle of kin¦de grutche / the wylle of the spiryte grutcheth not. and though I wyll but fayntly / my wylle is to wylle perfyghtly. that thy wylle. and not my wylle in me / & in all thynge be fulfyllid ¶ Fiat volūtas tua.

Whiche I clepe temptacōn / The strenger ye soule is to the loue of god / by mek¦nes & suffraunce. the sharper rodde our lorde takyth. for after the soule maye bere / he mesureth the strekes of temptacōns Yf the soule he nec¦ligent / or elles by Infyrmyte wyll walke oute abrode to ony manere vanyte. our lorde smyteth thenne sharply wyth some maner tempta¦cōn. to take fro him that vain lust & for he sholde abyde wyth him. & le∣se not his loue: And if it happe bi suffraūce that ye soule hath be ferre oute. assentyng or perfourmyng to ony maner vanytee Yet wyll not that louyng lorde lese his dere chil¦de / but by grace he clepyth hym / & yf he wylfully come home / gladli he is receyued / And for loue that oure lorde hath to his chosen chylde bit∣terli he beteth him to purge him for his trespasse / & toucheth him wyth sharpnes euermore to abyde at ho∣me in our lordes seruyse / & all thys chastysing is for loue / For as ou¦re lorde sayth hymself. he chastiseth whom he loueth / Chastysing may be in many maners / But by cause your entent is oonly to here of tēp¦tacyons / therfore at this tyme I le¦ue al maner other chastysing / pla¦ynly to speke / & wryte of the sharp¦nes of thise ghostly roddes / whiche I clepe temptacōns But or I wry¦te ony more / fyrst alway I coūsey∣le you. wake & praye that ye falle not in to tēptacōn. ¶ Vigilate & c̄ ¶ Of vi-generall temptacōns & other in specyall / caplm vj.

The first ye is of beneth cometh of oure owne flessh / whiche sorneth vs al day with glosig & flatrīg. bi cause we shold folow his lust & desires / & this tēptacōn is repreuable /
The seconde temptacōn thāt is ce¦ped aboue / is of our reison / whiche is the ouer parte of our soule / as whan reison assenteth / & deliteth / & is drawen to serue the flesshe / whi¦che sholde be subget to reason / and this temptacōn is wonderfull. The thyrde temptacōn that is cle∣pyd before / is wycked Isions. & fals suggestyons of the wyckyd deuylses. the whiche euer more whe¦ther we becom wakyng or slepyng they cast gynnes to catche vs that vneth we may scape / & this is ful dredefull / The fourth temptacyon, that is behynde / is mynde & thoug¦hte of sinnes before done wyth ly∣kyng & pleysaūce of ye flesshe in va¦nytee / or ony thyng that noughte is, and this is vnsemely / The v∣temptacyon that is on the right si de / is of grete prosperite. as whan all fortune & case fallen to a man euermore abidynge wythout ony losse or dysease / This is meuable. as a byrde that fleeth. Whiche som∣tyme is soo mery / that in his beste flighte falleth downe & deyeth and that is meuable / The sixt tēptacy∣on that is on the lift side / is grete aduersite. whiche somlyme brīgeth the soule in to soo grete heuynes / yt eyther it makyth him sore grutche ayenst god / orels to thynke & saye amys ayenst god. & al is to brīge him into to dispeyre / & this tēptaci¦on is greuous / Of thise vi. tēpta¦cyons generally I clepe him for bo the worldly men & ghostly men bē traueylid wyth suche temptacōns some man more / & some sesse. some wyth one & some with an other. af¦ter dysposicōn of kynde / & ordenaū¦ce & suffraūce of god / so that euery mā in eche degree is somwhat tra∣ueled that moost done hir befinesse to come to perfight loue / for to him the deuyll hath moost enuye / Ther¦fore as I sayd before to some goost¦ly liuers. there fallen many dredes bothe wakynge & slepyng / to some by horryble sightes / to some by wō¦derful heryng / & to some by dredful bodely felyng / Also to some in her begyn̄ynge cometh Imagynacyon of dredfull thynges / whiche they may not put away but by a specy∣all grace of god / To some suche thoughtes bē soo dredful & greuo¦us. that gladly they wolde suffre all manere bodely paynes / yf it ple¦sed god / soo they myght be deliuerd of suche maner thoughtes / for thē¦ne the soule dredeth soo sore / yt he rec¦styth not of the body.

But yet some wyll I shewe / whiche most comunely false in mē¦nys speche. & openly to knowenge / Some whan they here ony mische¦ef falle to ony man or woman / or here hem speke ony harde wordes or dredfull before her dethe / anone by temptacōn they fall in to a drede / ye long tyme after they may not put it fro her hertes / for nyght & day / in prayer & all other tymes they ben soo trowblid therwyth that verely almoost they vaast away for dre∣de of the soule / and makyth hem de¦sire the deth of the body for to be de¦liuerde of that temptacōn / but that desire wythout pleysing of god is sinne / as I sayd before. Thus it fa¦reth by hem also that wyll ymagy¦ne of the predestynacōn & of ye pre¦science / or of the foreknowinge of god.

This sauour may be a temp∣tacōn & yllusion of the deuyll / As whan it letteth deuocōn or prayer / Also some in the coūtree haue had somtyme wyckid sauours & fowle stenches in her nose, mouth / & thro∣te. and all is yllusion of the wye∣kyd spiryte to lete a man / whan he seeth hym soo feuent in the begyn¦nynge.

I shal smyte: & I shall hele / Our good lor¦de leeth / for he wyll make to liue, he smyteth. that he maye hele / he be∣teth outwarde. that he may hele in∣warde. the woūdes of trespace / and thus he smyteth ye flesshe / & maketh it tender the hardnes of the sowle / Also in a nother maner̄ god wo∣ūdeth his chosen chyldern / whan he woūdeth y• soule inwarde / & aceth of his betyng outwarde / for thēne he smyteth the hardnes of our hert wyth his desire / But whā he smy∣teth / he heleth. for he callith vs ayen to the feling of his rightwysnesse as whan we ben forfestned wyth a dart of his ferdnes. Our hertes ben full euyll helid whan they ben not woūded wyth noo loue of god Whan they fele not the harmes & the perylles of our begyn̄yng. whā they langour not bi way of cōpas¦sion. ne by none affeccōns / ne for Infirmyte / or dysease of our neigh¦bour. Also somtyme our lorde wo¦undeth our hertes / for they sholde be hole / whan he smyteth our soules whiche haue no feling / Somtyme wyth sharpe dartes of his loue / & anone he makyth there a ghostly fe¦ling by the hete of charyte / Thus thenne ye haue herde hew our lorde woūdeth outwarde & inwarde his chosen chyldern to make hem hole. Afterwarde thēne skylfully may we say as Iob sayd / Blessid is ye man that is vnder euermore has¦tysed of our lorde. Two vertues bē in this vndernemyng. one is to make hym flee sin̄e / yt he doo it not Or elles to amende those that ben¦done. & that is the seconde vertue of his chastysing / But oftyme it hap¦peth yt we flee not alonely blames & peryles that we knowe / and see / But some tyme we wote not ne know not how ne whan we offen¦de▪ and thus wexeth our soule blin¦de / and is full of derknes. in asmo¦che

her dethe by his euer lastyng right∣wysnes / soo that in this life oure lorde spareth not his louid chylder¦ne. This chastysing that I speke of / is not oonly of bodely diseases / but also of ghoostly dyseases / For it is full nedefull some tyme a go∣od man or woman to be tempted wyth vyces▪ and be btenwyth a goostly rodde: That while he is as¦sayled wyth vyces he shall not be prowde of vertues.

Thus was Io and thobye / and many other trowblid in this worlde. The thyr∣de cause maye be / for god sholde be the more worshypped and glorify¦ed in his werkes / As it befelle by the chylde that was borne blynde▪ Of whom our lorde sayd / that he was not blinde for his sin̄e / ne for his fader. ne moder / but that ye wer¦kes of god sholde be shewed in him The fourth cause may be for chas∣tisinge & purgyng hym of for hys synnes. as mary the suster of moy¦ses was chastysed / Also the chyl∣derne of Israhel / & other men & wy¦men. whyche god all daye chasty∣seth wyth bodely siknesses / & other trybulacyons / bothe bodely & goost¦ly. ¶ The fyfthe cause hath fallen to some men. for euerlastyng payn that they sholde suffre after her deth thus was herodes punysshyd. and they of Sodom. Dathan / & Aby∣ron / & suche other / Thise ben fyue pryncypalle causes of trybulacy∣ons & temptacyons / But many o¦ther skylles there ben. why some bē more traueyled wyth temptacōns And one notable skylle is for thei slde the better counseyle and com∣forte other in maters of ghostly dis¦eases / the whiche thei haue asayed and knowe by experyence.

Therfore sayth the same clerke / In eche mannys liuynge we sholde take hede of the ende. for our lord lokyth not oonly how we haue lyued before in our lyfe / But rather he takyth hede what

The fyrste is to comforte hym to thynke that the fende is so feble of hymselfe. that he hath noo pow∣er to ouercome ony mannys soule but yf a man wyll hymself. That the fende hath noo power / I shalle shewe after. ¶ The seconde remedye is that a man shall thynke on hys owne strengthe / that he hath by the yef te of god. This strengthe is concey∣uyd of Joye / of libertee / of armour
and of felishyp / It is a grete Joye to man whanne he thynketh howe he is dyscharged of the heuy burden of synne by the sacrament of confession & penaūce and this ioy is to him a grete stce¦ingth ayenst the deuyll / Also it is a grete fredom & libertee whan a man is deliuerde of the seruage of the deuyll / & made free to god by ye sacrament of confession & penaun∣ce / this libertee is a grete strength ayenst the fende / Also he that had none armour while he lay in sinne now he is armed wyth goddes ar∣mour / by crystis passion / and this armour is a grete strength ayenst the deuyll. Also he that was fyrst alone. while he lay in synne bi his conuersion & dooyng of penaūce  is assoylled / to the company of all rightfull men / this felishyp also  agrete strength ayenst the deuyll The thyrde remedye is for to thyn¦ke stedfastly. how our lorde light∣neth vs. & defendeth vs / as the pro∣phete sayd / Our lorde is my lighte & my helthe. whom shall I drede Thise ben remedyes for hem that ben traueyled wyth the temptacōn of dyspeyre / to be saued / And reme¦dies for hem that hen in dyspryre of perseueraūce after tyme thei ben tur¦ned / But now prrauenture some man wyll saye / I wote well. that goddis mercy is aboue al his wer kes / but how shall I knowe that I am able to receyue his mercy / To this me thynketh eche man maye see & fele / that he shell thynke hym∣selfe able to receyue merci / yf he wil aske it.

strengthe also a man hath agayn the fende / and how our enmie is hol¦den down by strength of holy chyr∣che / therfor̄ there shold noo man be in dyspeyre / but in eche drede & doub¦te: euermore a man sholde cast hys hert to god wyth a sadde truste / as the prophete sayth / Cast thy thoug¦hte in god / & he shall nourysshe the Also for a nedful and a generall remedye in this tēptacōn specyalli & suche other peryllous & dredfulle temptacōns / it is good to shew to a manis confessour / or eles to one or to other ghostly liuers. & aske of¦te counseyle / and to meke hym to o¦ther men̄is prayers / For there fal¦leth mā ne womā in myscheif / but suche as gooth fro the / & wylle not shewe her hert to noo man / & so they ben accombred for elles they sholde not false in to tēptacōn: Therfor̄ it is good to aske coūserle in eche ne∣de. & besily to pray for grace For he yt stondeth / must drede dyscretly / that he falle not / Wakyth ye thēne and prayeth yt ye falle not in to tēptaci¦on / ¶ Vigilate / & c̄ ¶ Of predestinacion & prescience of god / & of hem that ben traueylled wyth suche maner̄ maters / xv.

Therfore rea∣son dryueth vs for thre skylles to the desire of the loue of god & to lo∣ue god / The fyrst is for our owne mede / the seconde is for our profite. & the thyrde is for he is worthy to be loued / It it is nedeful to vs tes∣che we dāpnacōn / it is profitableto get vs blisse / & he is worthy to be  / for he loued first vs withou¦te deseruinge / of vs. But this loue is not most {pro}fytable loue. ne it is not most perfite skylle / whi we sho¦lde loue hī pryncipalli / for himself & for his godenes / & for he is al go   gode god & lorde be  for his godenes & wo¦rthyn without his godenes¦se we  wretches. & wyth his gode full blessid / y• good lors goodnes / whiche hath no to our godenes for man / wo mā & dey for mā / esō th dryueth vs to loue thys go¦od Ihu / & yf y• hert of the soule assēt to this reson / all thouh a mā haue it not of ghostli affecciō / as I sa¦yd befor̄ / soo y• of a gode wyll be he stired into a desire ofy• loue of god reson doeth his deuour / & thus loue maye be callid a resonable loue to god / thouh it be not full ghostli af¦fecciō / Also bi the heest of god eche mā is loūde to loue his neighbour as hīself. also bi reson eche mā shal be stired to yelde good to his neigh¦bour But first must we see what he is y• is our neighbour / eche mā y• is our neighbour / eyther he is oure frēde or he is not our enmye. or el¦les he is our enmye. perauēture ou¦re frēde. for he profiteth vs. or hath profited vs / he is not our ēmye for he noyeth vs not. or hath not noted vs. he is our ēmy for he doth vham̄ / or hath done / or wold vs
harme / he is our frende / eyther by kynrede or by grate: He is not our enmye / by cause he is In̄ocent / he is our enmy for wronge that he doeth Therfor̄ reason putteth thre skyl∣les why a man sholde loue his frē∣de / He putteth two skylles why he sholde loue his enmye. We sholde lo¦ue our. frende by naturell reison. for he is a man of familiarte with vs. and by offyce that is to say to reward him ayē for his frendship And for we be boūde by the precep¦te of god to loue our euyn crysten / we shall also that is not our ene∣mye. by kynde / for he is a man. and by the precept of god / we shall lo∣ue our enmye only / for god badde vs loue our enmyes / Eche man y• can thus bowe his wyll to reyson for to loue his neyghbour. thoughe he fele none affeccyon / he shall not lease charyte / ¶ I haue shewed you more of this loue to god. & to our neighbour. than I was in pur¦poos at the begyn̄yng of this cha¦pytre / neuertheles it may prouffy¦te other symple folke whan ye co∣myn wyth hem. But now to oure purpoos amonge resonable affec∣cyons that is most perfyghte / why¦che cometh for a nother mannes vertues liuynge / For that loue is full vertuouse / and full prouffi¦table / for what desire of vertues that we ben excyted or styred to bi affeccyon / And what for the lo∣thynge of sinne and drede that we haue by techynge or ensample of liuyng of suche goostly liuers. & yf our mynde stondeth alway euyn. & clere wythout ony corrupcōn in su¦che affecyon / thenne is it none har¦me / yf we desire the presence of su∣che men that we haue in affeccion For by her ensample we ben correc¦ted yf we ben euyll / yf we ben gode we be strengthed by hem. Yf we ha¦ue the same perfeccōn that they ha¦ue / eyther maye be stabled & comfor¦ted by other But though it be pro¦fytable to desire the bodely presence in gode affeccōn of good men & of holy men & wymen. It is not profi¦table to seke hem ofte. or to be tom¦che wyth hē for somtyme thei may be sought more than it nedyth as I sayd befor̄ By bodely presence of saynt poule & barnabe was ful cō∣fortable to her ghostli bredern in an tioche▪ Yet they herde how it was sa¦id to hem th by the holi ghost. De∣parte poule & barnabe in to mynys tracyon / in y• whiche I haue callid hē to her prayers & lete hē goo. Al¦so in all suche affeccions it is ful nedefull to see the ende. that mygh¦te falle. therof. as well as the begi¦nynge / that the cause of that affec¦cyon for fals suggestyons and subtyltees of our enemye. and by our own̄ vnstabylnes & infirmite
¶ Thise affeccyons ben in the be∣gynnyng holi & resonable / but som̄¦tyme they ben ēded in a nother ma¦nere affeccyon / or somwhat chaū∣ged / Of this chaungyng I rede many ensamples / how full holi mē haue ben begyled / whiche ensāples nedennot to be shewed at this tune in specyall / also I wyll not / For so me whan they rede suche ensāples that ben writen for good entent / they torne it after to theyr nyce con¦ceytes. and make therof sportes & scornes. and the cause is. for they ben soo blinde. that they maye not ne can not see her owne Infyrmite But this I say for a generall rule what man or woman / religious or other degree that dredeth not su¦che affeccyons / he stondeth or goth in a ful slipper waye / and he or she what he be: is likly to haue a foule false / but he bewaar / The cause of chaūgyng of suche affeccōns is to moche famyliarite / or for tobe to ho¦omly / Therfor̄ the beste remedye to flee the peryll of vnresonable affec¦cyon, is euermore to drede the ende that the affeccōn in the ende be no∣ne other thrugh to moche famylia¦ryte that it was in the begynnyng For amonge all preuy deceytes & temptacōns this is one of the mo¦ost preuy & the moost deceyuable Of this mater̄ now nomore Moche more I myght wryte yf ne¦de were. But this I hope suffyseth to you / ¶ Now ferdermore I wyl she we generall remedyes ayenst al ghostli temptacōns: But for a so∣uereyne remedye ayenst all this & all other / euermor̄ I coūseyle yow Wakyth & prayeth that ye falle not in to temptacion / ¶ Vigilate / & c̄ / ¶ How pacycus is a generall re¦medy ayenst all traueyles & temp∣tacōns / and of other general reme¦dyes ayenst all goostly temptacy∣ons / caplm xxiiij IN all trybulacyons & tēp. tacyons / it is nedefull to be pacyent / as for pryncypall remedye ayenst all hodely dyseases & goostly. eche man yf he serche hys conscyence wel & his defawtes / for the whiche he is rightfully chasty∣sed. he shall bere moche the more liʒ¦ter the chastysing that he suffreth / Therfor̄ sayth an holy clerke Ysi∣derus / Noo man ne woman sholde grutche in goddes scorgynges / for as moche as he is amended by that that he is vndertake & chastysed. And in this we shold lerne not to grutche whan we suffre hardenes or aduersitee. though it be soo / that we knowe not / for what defawte we suffre. For he that is chastysed of god. & grutcheth ayenst god. ac∣cuseth the rightwysnes of hym / that demith rightfully. These it is
spedefull in all the chastysinge of god mekely to suffre wythout o∣ny grutchyng / Also it is a nother remedye to deme ourselfe worthy all suche chastysinges and many harder / / though they come / For in that demyng we shall the better su¦ffre hardenes & sharpnes. And well we maye suppose that right∣fully we shall suffre / For of hym we ben demed. whose dome may ne¦uer be vnrightfull / Therfor̄ sayth the clerke Ysiderus he that know¦eth in his herte. that all his chasti singe that he suffreth comyth of a ryghtfull dome of god. thoughe he know not for what defawte he suf¦freth. yet he is Justified in the sigh¦te of god. in asmoche as he acuseth hymself & worshipeth & cōmendeth the rightwis god / And though y• soule be tormēted wyth ghostle tēp∣tacyons of the wycked spiryte we sholde not suppose therfor̄ that we ben not aliened or forsake of oure good lorde. But we shall trustly hope that we ben the more accepta¦ble to god. whan we deme soo of ourselfe / and worship god & thāke him of his rightwysnes. Also it is a nother remedye ayenst suche tēptacyons / to thanke god for his rightfull chastysing / For he chas∣styseth vs neuer: but for our grete profyte. Therfor̄ sayth the same clerke Ysiderus. A rightful man soule is traueled wyth dyuers tēp¦tacyons for his grete profyte by ye dome of god. For the whiche yf he yeue lowely & louely thankynges to god / and deme al chastising rt fulli sende of god for his owne de fawte. thenne shall all that passy∣on that he suffreth be accompted to hym for vertue. For as moche as gladly he suffreth & demyth hymsel¦fe worthy to suffre. and thankyth god lowely for his passions that he suffreth ¶ Thus thenne haue we shewed you thre pryncypall re¦medyes ayenst temptacions. Firs te to suffre paciently the s to deme ourself worthy to suffre and y• thirde to thanke god for his cha¦stysing loweli Also in eche temp∣tacōn & trybulacion bodely or ghost¦ly it is full comfortable to thynke on the wordes that sayth by y• pro∣phete in the psalme. Cū ip̄o sū in¦tribulacione  c̄: As I sayd in the begynnyng of the fyrst chapytre / Vpon thyse wordes thought sain te bernarde whan he sayd / Lord ye¦ue me alway trybulacōn / that y• in¦warde alway be wyth me By thy¦se wordes the wyl of reson desireth alway temptacōn or trybulacyon. for purgynge or chastysing of the soule / but the wyll of kynde desireth the contrary. And aslonge as we wythstonde tēptacion / neuer assen¦tyng to hem bi the wyll of reson. so
longe they trowblid vs. and by y• they ben nedefull / For yf we assen¦te to hem ayenst reyson / thēne shold we encline to y• nether wyll / whi∣che is the wyll of kynde / & thenne we stonde in grete peryll. Therfore what euer grete temptacōn a man haue / whether it be of the fayth / or of ony drede. or of ony stirynge of dyspeyre / or blasphemye / or of ony wicked temptacōn. ghostli or other Aslonge as the wyll of reyson sa¦ith contrary / there is noo drede. for it is noo sinne. For though ony be traueyled by thynstygacōn of y• fende / that he is in doubte of the by¦leue of the sacrament of the awter Aslonge as he is sory therof: that he may not byleue it fully / but fay¦ne he wolde / this man therwhyles sin̄eth not in that. & thus it fareth by all hie temptacyons / Also yf a man or woman / loue not his neig¦hbour. or brother or suster / or elles perauenture hath enuye to hem / yf it soo he that he wolde loue hem. & is soo be that he loue hem not / in this he syn̄eth not / For as sayth saynte austyn / that eche synne that is not wylfull is noo sin̄e / that is to say. noo dedeli sinne. But all though suche temptacōns ben no sin̄e. whi¦che ben not wylfull. yet it is nede∣ful to deme in ourself / that they co¦me to vs for some sinne. knowen to vs / or vnknowen. As I sayd befor̄ / for a generall rule ayenst al temptacōns. It is nedeful to shew it to our confessours / eyther in ge∣nerall wordes / or in specyall. For suche a confessour it might be / that it were not spedefull. to shewe hym all goostli temptacōns in pecy all that falle or may falle to a ghostli liuer / Therfor̄ to suche a confessour it suffyseth to speke of temptaciōs generally / in to tyme a man maye com̄ & aske coūseyle of a nother mā more discrete & more experte in su∣che mater̄ / Thus thēne shal ye con¦ferme your wylle to goddes wylle! in all temptacōns / & say or thinke in the maner̄ as I sayd befor̄ in the fyrst chapitre ¶ Also a nother re¦medy is & a specyall ayēst wyckid spyrites to thynke on the passion of cryst. crossing vpon the forhede & the brest. and some done pryncy∣palli wyth the tokē of thaw / & say ¶ In not̄e Ihu signo me thaw. & wyth other blessinges / Some say a vers that is in the ympne Cultor dei memēto / in this maner̄ ¶ O tortuose serpens discede disce de xp̄s hic est. cristus hic est liques¦ce signū  ipsi nosci dāpnat tuam cateruā.

Ayenst couetyse & ayenst the spyces therof it is a rem to thynke. what ryll it is in g of ryches what besines  traye is in the kepyng fro  &  deceyuable men Also it is good to thynke that a ryche man is no∣re siker.  maye lityll & lityll multeplie / but soden they ben dys perklid Also ryches encreaseth ana¦tyce in a couetous man as drinke encreseth thurst in a man that ha the the dropesie. therfor̄ it is a gre¦te folie to coueyte that dyseaseth bo¦the body & soule.

Also in ty∣ne of wrathe it is good to chaun∣ge his occupacyon / and put hym to some other likyng besines / wher by the herte may be occupyed wyth some good communycacyon / or wyth some wysdome to make him forgete his wrathe. Of this passy on it is good to bewar̄ For it hur¦teth soone the conscyence / and ta¦kyth awaye a mannes fame / It sclaundreth other men / It ma∣kyth the herte in vnrest: It dryueth oute the holy ghost / It deseruyth pa¦ynes / Also it is a remedie for this passion to vse dedes of lowlynes and sofnes / As a man to aske for gyuenesse fyrst of hym that wra∣thyd hym.

As worshippes. richesses. lustes / or va¦nytees. and suche passing thynges For he that desireth suche. hath co nunely enuye to hem. that hath su¦che. but yf he maye haue the same or like. Also it is good to thynke that though he had not that thyn¦ge / for the whiche he hath enuye to other Yet perauenture sholde he not haue it. Wherto thenne sholde we be trowblid for ony good / or wor¦shyp or for ony other thyng / that a nother man hathe. wythoute oure harme. In this enuye / yf a man falle in to hatred: thenne it is goo¦de to thynke / that god forgyueth not a mannes sinnes / aslonge as he hateth his neyghbour. Also it is good to thynke / yf a man shall be saued he must conferme hym to his brother. therfor̄ beter it is to do at betyme. than abyde tyll it be to la¦te. Also it is good to thynke / that it helpeth not to thynke longe on wronges. but rather it turmenteth & bryndeth a man in to vnrest / ther¦for̄ it is good doo after techyng of saynt poul. that saith Be not ouer¦come of euyll / but ouercome euyll in good. Also ayēst the passion of enuye / it is a souereyne remedye a man or a woman to be bon / & to vse dedes of charyte. & to loue his enmyes to praye for hem yt dysease hym / to do good to hym that hateth hym / to comfort hem yt ben heuy & so¦ry. to teche hem that ben vncūnyng & to part wyth other that haue nede of his goodes. bothe bodeli & ghost¦ly / suche as god hath sent to hym / Thise remedyes wyth contynell prayers may helpe moche ayenst the passion of euie or hate / Ayenst slo¦uth & the spices therof it is a reme dye to thynke ofte vpon the trauei¦le / that crist had in erth & vpon his good werkes to whose goodnesse al good werkes: that all mē may doo ben not in cōparyson. but as a drope of water to the quantyte of the grete see / Also it is good to be ofte wyth good mē & wymen that gladly wyll speke of god. ¶ Also some tyme grete heuynes comyth of slowthe. Therfore to su¦che dyuerse occupacyons. and cha¦ungynges from one good werke to a nother. ben to suche men or wymmen to putte awaye heuynes ¶ Also though that
a man or woman be heuy or wery in goostly werkes. as for prayer or other deuocyon / It is a remedye to stryue therwyth & kepe styll his traueyle / tyll he may haue comfort by grace / as I sayd befor̄ in the fo∣urth chapytre. Also ayenst slouth it is a remedye to thynke what pe∣rylles we falle in nyghte & day / sle¦pyng & wakyng. In slepyng men falle somtyme in perill of fyre and water / & theues wakyng. there ry∣seth vp in our hertes grete floodes of vanytees / & many vycked tho∣ughtes / or elles fyre of some wyc∣ked desires / is kyndled in our con∣scyence / or elles theues. that is to say wycked spirytes. or wyckyd men he day assayle vs / Therfore saynt Jerom sayth / Doo alwaye some good that the deuyll fynde ye neuer vnocupyed Also ayenst slo¦uth it is a remedye to thynke how good & how delectable is the euer∣lastyng mede. to the whiche maye noo man come wythoute fructuo∣us labour. Also to thynke how her¦ryble & how dredful. is the euerlas¦tyng payne / to the whiche payne men maye be broughte by southe and ydlenes and werynes of go∣od dedes. ¶ Thus thenne haue I shewed that besinesse and ocupacyon / and chaungyng of werkes / As some tyme to rede some tyme to praye and other honest traueyle, en speci¦all remedies agaynst slouthe / and ydlenesse / ¶ Ayenst Glotenye and the spy¦ces therof.

FOr asmeche as thappostle sayth y• we may not pleyse god wythout good fayth & byleue / therfor̄ it is to wyte y• oure olde enmye the deuyll besieth hym what he may wyth fals suggesty∣ōs & dyues ymagynacōns to hyn¦der & destroy ful fayth. that is begī¦nyng & groūde of all good werkin¦ge / & whom he may not vtterli beī∣ge oute of his faythe / yet netheles wyth his wālaces. & his wyles he is alway aboute to dystrowble hē. & for to bryng in doubt of the same fayth. suche as wolde most gladly stonde stable & sure & therfor̄ it ne∣deth to wythstōde suche myssendin¦ges in / & fondīg with godwarnes & clere besines of hert & of soule / y• is to wyte all maner̄ fātafies / mis¦likynges & mysconceyt / & al the fyl the of blasphemye. that is to say. it reuerēce or dyspite ayēst god & his saynt how soo euer the deuil shew hem to mānes soule. whe der that it be byy• fight / or bi herīg▪ for to put hem anone awaye  dispyse hem. & loke that none suche dyspite. suche vnkynde materes. ne strogle not a yenst hem / Now for to wythstonde all suche temptacyons the snt the better it is to vnderstonde. that as dauyd sayth in the sawte / The thouʒt & the thynkes of man ben ofte ydle & vayne / And as boli doc¦tours sayen therupon suche thyn∣kynges of mē ben dyuers & with oute nombre. Wherfore a man shall not tarye ne dwelle in suche thoughtes / Ne wounder moche on theym / neyther enserche theym in his soule / ne dyspute the causes of theim / For the more besely that he medleth hym wyth suche errours and falsenes for to auayde theim oonly by souereyntee of his owne wytte / The more and also the fer∣der in he wadeth in to hem warde And perauenture ouerdepeth and drenchyth hymselfe in them. Wher¦fore a man shall not for suche fal mysrennynges in to his soule an∣gre hym selfe in hem, or
dysease hym / or went that suche so¦ry thoughte come oonly of hys owne malice / or of his owne wyt¦te. for suche a maner̄ temptacōn / so it be mekeli & easeli / is more to his punysshyng than to encresing of gylte / or of his payne / And why For to a man that willith to be fa¦ythfull. suche maner̄ temptaciō is dyspleysing / and moche ayenst his wyll / wherfor̄ it is painful to him but not gyltfull of fin̄e. Syth ene¦ry syn̄e is wylfull. or elles no fin̄e as sayth saynt austyn in his boke of perfeccōn of rightwysnes / Also saynt Ysidere sayth he that is tor∣mented by the deuylles ensautes wyth ghostli temptacōns or passy¦ons. loke he trowe ne bileue not the refor̄ / that he is vtterly forsakē of his god. that suffreth hym so to be tempted / but loke on eche side y• mo¦re ofter he worship god. & yet y• sa∣me clerke ysidere sayth.

Also in the same boke / the said ysidere sayth Our aduersarye the deuyll is not wery to greue y• rihtwysmā / ne he resteth neuer to reyse bataylles of tēptacōns ayēst hym. for eyther he fulfylleth him wyth anguysshe of hert or of soule.. or eltes he ayth ayenst hym bodely sorowes / & oft ti¦mes he tormenteth soo man̄es tho¦ughte wyth dyseases of suche ma∣ner̄ temptacyons / that a man fal∣leth almoost in wanhope / But yet netheles yf suche a sowle ston∣deth thenne stedfast in the drede of god. & in his loue. suche manere of anguysshe shall moche auayle & pro¦fyte hym in encreace of his mede And thenne suche a sowle is not twyn̄ed ne departed from his god. But rather Joyned to hym / whan he is angred / and tormented wyth suche manere anguysshes / soo that that he kepe hym wythin the bondes of pacyence. Many dysease suffreth a ight∣wys mannes sowle. by false sug∣gestyon. and Instygacyon. and sti¦ryng of the deuyll / But yet maye he not make hym to perysshe therby ne mynysshe him of the blisse of he∣uen. For our lorde god that is soo meke and mercyfull / accounteth not to mannes gylt or synne: that he of his myghty lordshyp and ma¦geste wyll that a man suffre / For as holy doctours sayen / There we done amys / and synnen / where that we fallen / and ben ouercome wyth couetyse or lust: But there that by vyolence / and mawgry vs we ben broughte in to wretchyd∣nesse / It is on̄ly payne to vs & not synne
Thus sayth thys worthy clerke Ysidere. Netheles it semeth that su¦che maner̄ tēptacion of myswenīg put in to man̄es sowle by yllusion And scornyng of the deuyll were grete gylte orsin̄e / whā it is an ex¦citacyon for to put away dobte For eche gylte done by wyll or vn knowyng. as yf a man wold not know of his frowarde wyll / or el¦les of vncūnyng / as is sinne / for suche maner̄ wyll torneth more in to errour than in to trouthe / Then̄e sith it is soo that fayth is habyte of wyll / who soo haue wyll to byle¦ue. byleueth / who soo hath wylle to hope. hopeth / who soo is not in wyll to doubt / doubteth not And in this wyse thouh a man be asesed in ma¦nere as I sayd befor̄ / Yet neuer∣theles. & his herte stonde to byleue well / he byleueth wel.

Therfor̄ the cursid enmye con¦sidereth. and beholdeth the state of e¦uery man / For as sayth eo the pope tretyng of circumcysion this olde enmye leueth neuer of to caste forth ayenst man his gren̄es of de¦ceytes soo that he myght some wy¦se destroye the fayth of hem that bē in good byleue / For he knoweth wel ynough to whom he shall pro∣fer̄ the desire: and the eernyng of co¦uetyse / to whom the foule lustes of glotenye / to whom also he shal put forth the steryng of lecherye / And to whom he shall poore in the ve∣nym of enuye / Whom he shall dyse ase wyth sorowe.

That is to say: my soule is sorowfull & dredful to the deth / Also in his passion he cryed thus / my god / my god why hast y• forsake me. Loke also that he brin¦ge to mynde the worde that Ysaye sayth in god the faders behalfe to Ihesu cryst his sone / and to eche of his lim̄es / As for a lityl stounde I haue lefte the / And for a lityll moment of myne Indygnacyon. & lityll settynge by of the for a tyme I haue hedde my face a while from the.

Hope & trust in thy god. how euer so he wil doo wyth the / And also loke suche one praye. & singe yf he can / And doo somtyme other good dedes a∣monge / Also loke he beholde holy wrytte / & the sawes of prophe & pryncypally crystis sawes is the gospell / And all he it that he fele noo sensible deuocyon. ne swetnes therin / as for that tyme / yet loke he suffre mekely. For the good wyll that he hath therto / shall suffyce / & be sufficyent to him to saluacyon. Ofte tymes the deuocyon that a man sholde haue & fest. is profyta∣bli wythdrawe from hym. that his prāyer maye be the more merytory & nedeful. Loo what lernarde say∣the vpon this text of the cantycles I haue soughte / & foūde noughte / For otherwhile he sayth / our spou se & our lorde hydeth hym / whan he is soughte. that we sholde seke him the more besely / Herto acordeth sa∣ynt austyn in a boke de verbo dn̄i God yeuyth otherwhile latter. for we sholde telle the more deynte of his yeftes / For thynges longe de∣sired ben the more swete & likynge to the geter. And ofte tymes thin¦ges soone goten / ben in lityll pryce as to regarde / Aske therfor̄. & seche besely in thyne askyng. And holde on. and encrease in thyne sekynge that thou may wynne & gete. For god kepyth to the. that he wyll not that a man yeue to the / And why dooth he soo / for thou sheldest lerne to desire gretly grete yeftes. Loo also what saynt gregory sayth. Thenne ben goddes chosen best her∣de / whan they be not harde of hym after her owne desire / For god gy¦ueth to some in the begynnynge of her lurnyng a feling of swetnesse in duocion / by y• whiche they may be goūded in the loue of her god. And yet afterwarde he wythdraw¦eth it from him soo thrugh dysease that they suffre in suche manere / y• they maye gete hem the more mede & meryte afterwarde / for her huge
pacyence & suffrynge For as wyt¦nesseth the phylosopher: vertu stō deth moost in harde getyng of thin¦ges and in trauerses to come ther to. thēne semith it well herof / that ye good goten of full harde / soo it be truly goten / is longest / & wyth mo¦ost vertue holden & had.

For peter sayd / lorde it is good that we dwelle stylle here / But it was full harde & ferefull to hym for to be wyth cryst in his cruel per¦secucyon. Whan he sayd I knewe neuer that man. And netheles he that for a worde of a wenche forso¦ke hym tho. afterward thrugh yef¦te & strengthe of the holy goost / he knowleged hym before kynges & prynces / And stode wyth him stif¦ly all to the deth / Therfor̄ yf suche ghosily temptacyon come / wexe in thyne herte therfor̄. as soone as yu mayst afterwarde / and praye besely. god of hys grace. and thou shalte be strenger in thy bileue after. than euer thou were before ferdermor̄ for asmoche as suche manere temp¦tacyons fallen somwhat of outr∣thwartnes of complecōn. loke eche suche one that is soo tempted that he be not moche alone by hymselfe. ne that he besie him not ouermoche whan he is alone in thynkyng on suche thoughtes. But lete him vse wyse counseyle / and speke of wyse men & sadde. And as they wyll re¦de hym loke he stonde that to in oni wyse / Lo what saith the wyse mā Woo to hym yt is alone for whan he falleth he hath none to helpe him vp. & thēne whā a man is thus tro¦wblid is angry & heuy and drede∣ful of complexion. and also of his temptacion. lete hym therfor̄ draw to dysporte & honeste myrthe wyth strength & vertue of soule / And ye more that he is traueled / somoche ye more loke he gyue hym as I sayd euer to honest myrth & gladnes This dide goddes apostles for thi went Joyfull fro the dome of prin¦ces & of other domes men thāking
god that they myght be worthy to suffre payn & passion for his loue And all be it that he fele noo suche goostli comforte in his sowle whā he is soo tro wblid / as thise holi ap∣postles felten / But perauenture he felith lityll or none. yet loke he suf¦fre mekeli. And drawe him the¦re he may be comferted outwarde wyth honest companye & clene / lest as sayth the apostle / Suche one myghte be spylled wyth ouermoche heuynes / And though suche one drawe ofter to companye and to myrth. than dooth another that is not soo tempted / he synneth not the¦re in / soo, he doo it to recouer his hele And not for lust & vanyte. Also it is to vnderstonde that the apostle saith / The angel sathanas and of derkaes turneth oft: him¦selfe. all though we see it not into angell of lighte. makyng men de∣me that vyces ben vertues / hidyn¦ge errours & falsnes vnder coloure of trouthe / Loo what sayth saynte gregory / This angell of the deuyl otherwhile whan he seeth a man o¦cupyed in goddis seruyce / the why¦che he is holden to doo of dette / he ma¦kyth him to leue it / And for to thī¦ke on his sinnes: and for to haue conscyence therof. And for to mu se theron / and dispute therof in that tyme / vnder coloure of good thyn∣kyng / whan it oughte be doo: or to fore or after. For as the wyse mā sayth / All thyng hath tyme / And therfore eche thyng sholde be doo ty∣me / his / THe moost souereyne reme∣dye. And approuyd for to dryue awaye suche fantasy es and conceytes of goostly temp∣tacyons. is for to praye / And in tyme of prayer to lete all suche tho∣ughtes to slide awaye / and tarye not vpon hem / For though the en mye brynge that tyme in to thy tho¦ught. whether thou be truly shryue as thou sholdest / and also bryngeth the in doubte. whether thy synnes ben foryeuen the. or noo. the why∣che weren foryeuē / and done away thorugh very confession & contricy on longe before / And though he know it to be soo some tyme. now is it hid from his mynde / and also his good dedes by crafte of the en∣mye / that bringeth in thus to suche a mannes mynde gastnesse & dre∣de. Ne he purposith not by sendyng in of suche thoughtes for his sin̄es that his sowle shold be the more cle¦ne by confession / Or by suche ma∣nere of examynacōn & ransakyng But for to trowble it. and brynge it from rest and pees / For this an¦gell and spyrite of pestylence desy∣reth. and wylleth alwaye the deba¦te of sowle. whoos deceytes and fal¦se tyzfiynges in that partye / a mā

Yet came he not downe in haast at his byddyng / But choos rather to co∣me downe by the grees of vertues and dyscrecion / yeuyng vs ensam¦ple y• we sholde not anone be buxum to his false entyfinge put in to vs vnder liknes of good / but to with stonde holsomly by waye of dyscre cyon / and of good dome. ¶ Also this fals spiryte of erro∣ur bryngeth in otherwhyle & wrap¦peth y• mynde wyth dyuers perplex ytees. and doubtynges. wyth won¦derfull and preuy sterynges. that he makith suche one wene that thi¦ge that is leefull and good / to be sinne. and venyall sinne to be dede¦ly sinne. And that he must be shri¦uen of all suche sinnes in specyall Not for he wolde that a man were clene. But for he wolde trouble his soule / & dysease it / And brynge a man in to errour of conscyence & mysdemyng. Ye in soo moche that he dryueth mannes sowle some ty¦me more for to assente to an errou¦re / than for to meke hym after dew dyscrecyon / and good demyng. and this is heresie / Wherfor̄ eueri sucht one leue his errours after dyscre counseyle / and dome of holy men. & wyse: and folowe trouthe / And yf suche one saye that he may not put it away / he sayth not sooth / And he may wyllē to put from him. and thn̄e as for that tyme it is away And by that as oft as he wylneth soo / as ofte it is away. For all be it that errour occupie his soule. yet he maye haue wyll that tyme to be make & buxum / This shewed the apostle whan he said / Leue ye not ne trust ye not to euery spiryte / but preueth and assayeth fyrst what hem ben / In this manere asked
Josue / whether the angell was for hym / or les for his enmyes / and therfore dysccyon and good do∣me is nedefull / For as sayd somty¦me a wyse man.
