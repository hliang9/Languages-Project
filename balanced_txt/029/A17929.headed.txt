Here begynneth a litill boke necessarye & behouefull aʒenst the Pestilence T the reuerence & worschip of the bles¦sed Trinyte & of the glorious virgyn saynt marye & the conseruacion of the comyn wele of alle cristen people / aswell for them that ben hole as for remedie of them that ben seke. I the Bisshop of Arusiens in the roy¦ame of Denmarke doctour of Phisike wille write by the moost experte & famous doctours auctorised in Phisike somme thinges of the in¦firmyte of pestilence whiche dayly enfecteth & sone suffreth vs to departe oute of this lyfe. First I wil write the tokenes of this īfirmyte The second the causes wherof it cometh The thirde remedies for the same The fourthe comforte for the herte & the pncipal membres of the body The .v. when it schal be season to be lett blode First I sayde the tokenes of this infirmite .vij. thinges ought to be noted in the same The first is when in a sommers daye the weder often times chaungeth. as ī the mornyng the
wedyr appereth to payne / afterward it ap{per}ith cloudy & atte last wyndy ī the south The .ij token is whan ī sōmer the dayes ap{per}ith all̄ derke & like to mynr & yet it myneth not. & if many dayes so {con}tinue it is to drede of grete pestilence The .iij. tokyn is whan grete mul¦titude of flies ben apon the eerthe thenne it is signe the ayer is venemous and infect The fourth token is whan the sterres semen ofte ti¦mes to falle then it is token that the ayer ys infect with moche venemous vapours. The .v. token is whan a blasing sterre is see ī the element then it is signe to be sone after grete pestilence or grete māslaghter ī bataille The .vi. token is whan ther is grete lightnynge & thūdre namely out of the south The .vij. token is whan grete wyndes passen out of the south they be foule & vnclene. therfore whan these tokenes ap{per}e it is to drede grete pestilen¦ce but god of his mercy wille remeue it Here after folowen the causes of pestilence The pestilence cometh of .iij. thinges som¦time it cometh fro the rote bynethe Otherwhile fro the rote aboue so that we may fele sensibly
how the chaunge of the ayer appereth vnto vs And somtyme it cometh of bothe to gider as well fro the rote aboue as fro the rote bynethe As we see a sege or preuy next to a chambre or of any other particuler thyng whyche cor∣rupteth the ayer in his substaunce and quali∣te whiche is a thyng may happe euery daye: And thereof cometh the ague of pestylence. And aboute the same many physicions be de¦ceyued: not supposing this axes to be a Pe∣stilence / somtime it cometh of dede careyn / or corrupcion of standyng waters in diches or slouhes & other corrupt places & these thīges somtime be vniuersall̄ & somtime {per}ticuler Fro the rote aboue: it fortuneth the causes of the bodyes aboue ī thayer by whom the spirite of lyfe is corrupte in a man or in a beste: In li¦ke wyse as Auycenne sayth ī his fourth bo∣ke / by the forme of thayer aboue / the bodyes benethe lightly be infecte: For thynpressy∣ons aboue corrupteth the ayer and so the spi¦rites of a man ben corrupt. This infirmyte cometh also from the rote aboue and bynethe: whanne of thynpressyons aboue / the ayer
is corrupt & of the putrifaccion or rotyn caceyn of the vyle places benethe an infirmite is cau∣sed in a man. & suche an infirmyte somtime is an axes. somtime a postume or a swellyng & that is in many thynges. Also the ayer īspy¦red is venemous & corrupt hurtīg the herte that nature many wayes is greued so that he {per}cey¦ueth not his harme: For the vryne appereth fayer & scheweh gode digestion yet neuthles the pacient is like to dye / wherfore many phy¦sicions seyng the vryn of their pacientes they speke su{per}ficially & be deceyued: Therfore it is nede that euy paciēt {pro}uyde to him selfe a gode & ex{per}te physicion. These thinges wryton be∣fore are the causes of pestilence But aboute thse thinges .ij. q̄stions be meued. The first ys wherfore one dyeth & another dyeth not in a towne where mē be dede ī one hous & ī another hous ther dyeth none. The .ij. q̄stion is whe∣ther pestilence sores be contagious. To the first q̄stion I saye it may happe to be of .ii. causes that is to say of that thīg that doth & of that thīg that suffreth. An ensample of that thīg that doth / the influence of the bodies aboue be
holdeth that place or that place more than this place or this place. & the pacient is more dispo¦sed to die than another Therfore it is to be no¦ted that bodies be more hote disposed of oopyn poorys than bodies īfect hauīg the pores stop∣ped with many humours wher bodies be of re¦solucion or opening as men that abusen them self with wymmē or vsen ofte times bathes. or men that be hote with labour or grete angre their bodies be more disposed to this sekenes. To the .ij. q̄stion I say that pestilence sores be {con}tagious because of enfect humours bodies & the reke or smoke of suche sores is venemous & corrupteth the ayer & therfore it is to flee fro su¦che {per}sons as be īfect In pestilēce time no body sholde stande ī grete prece of peple for som mā of thē may be infect Therfore wise phisiciēs vi¦siting seke folke stāde ferre fro the paciēt holdīg their face toward the dore or wyndowe & so shal the seruants of seke folke stāde Also it is gode to a pacient euy day to change his chābre & of¦ten times to haue the wyndowes open ayēst the north & eest & to spere the wyndowes ayēst the south For the south wīde hath two causes of
putrifaccion The first is it maketh a mā be ī hole or seke feble in their bodies: The .ij. cā is as it is writon ī the .iij. of Amphorismie the south winde greueth the heering & hurteth the herte because it openeth the pooris of mā & entreth īto the herte wherfore it is gode ī time of pestilēce to an hole mā whan the wīde is in the south to be withī the hous al day & if it ne¦deth to go out yet lete a mā abide ī his hous til the sonne be vp in the eest passing southward. The remedies for the Pestilence Now it is to wete by what remedies a mā ma pserue him self fro pestilence first see the writīg of Ieremy the {pro}phete that a mā ought to forsa¦ke euil thīges & do gode dedes & mekely to cō¦fesse his sinnes for whi it is the hiest remedie ī time of pestilence penance & {con}fession to be pfer¦red al other medicines Neutheles I {pro}mitte you verely it is a gode remedy to voyde & chaunge thinfect place: but som may not proffitably change their places therfore asmoche as to thē is possible it is teschewe euy cause of putrifac¦tion & stinking & namely euery fleschely lust with wymmē shalbe eschewed Also the sothern
winde whiche is naturelly infectif therfor spere the windowes ayenst the south as it is sayde before til the first houre after the middes of the day then opene the wyndowes ayēst the north Of the same cause euy foule stinche is to be es¦chewed of stabyl stinkyng feldes wayes or stre¦tes & namely of stinking dede careyn & moste of stynking wats where in many placee wat is kepte .ij. dayes or .ij. nightes. or ellys ther be gutters of water casten vnder therthe whi¦che causeth grete stinke & corrupcion & of this cause som deye in that hous where suche thyn∣ges happen & in another hous dye none as yt is sayd afore Like wise in that place wher the wurtes & coles putrefied it maketh a noyfull sauour & stynking. For like as by the swete odour of bawme the herte & the spirites laue re¦creaciō so of euyl sauours they be made feble wherfor kepe your hons that an infect ayer entre not in. for an infect ayer most causeth putrifacciō in places & houses wher folk slipe therfore lette your hous be clene & make clere fire of wode flaming Lett your hous be made wich fumigacion of herbes whiche be the leuys
of baye tree Ieneper vberiorgany it is ī tha po¦ticaue stoppes worm vode rewe nugwort & of the tree of aloes whiche is best but it is dere suche a fumee taken by the mouthe & eeris openeth thynward {per}tes of the body Also it is teschew all grete replecions because ful bodies be light¦ly infect as auycēne sayth in the fourth canō They that chargen their bodies with replecciō shorten their lyfe Also comyn bathes are to be eschewed for a litil crust corrupteth al the body Therfore the peple asmoche as is possible is to be eschewd lest of infect brethes som mā be infect But whan the multitude of peple may not be eschewed then vse the remedies folowing, In the morning whan ye use wesshe a litil rewe & one or two filberd nottes clene with salte & ete thē & if that can not be had then ete brede or a toste sopped ī vinegre namely in troubelo{us} & cloudy weder Also in time of pestilēce it is better ta∣byde within the hous for it is not holsom to go in the cite or town. Also sprenkle your hows specially in sōmer with vinegre & roses & with the leuys of vyn tree Also it is gode to wasshe often times in the day your hādes with wat &
vinegre & wipe your face with your handes & smelle to thē Also it is gode alway to sauo aygre thinges. In the mount of pessulane I might not eschewe the {con}pany of peple for I wēt fro hous to hous becāe of my poute to cureseke folkes therfore brede or a sponge sopped in vi¦negre I toke with me holding it to my mouth & nose because al egre thinges stoppen the way¦es of humours & suffreth no venemous thin¦ges to ent into a mānys body & so I escaped the pestilence my felows supposing that I shold not liue These thinges I haue {pro}ued by my self The {con}fortes of the herte & the pncipal mēbres The {con}fortes of the herte be these / faffron Canifex planteyn with other herbes thy oē the inward spirite & these be gode emōg the co∣myn peple where lightly it happeth that one is infect of another therfore beware the breth of another Also of infect ayer a mans eyen be made dymme yf he bere not these sayd thin∣ges in his hande Also it is holsom to wasshe your mouth face eyen & handes often times in the day with rosewat medled with vinegre & if ye haue no rosewat take vinegre: & so these
thinges vsed ye may go surely emōg the peple Also a natural laxe of the bely is a grete re∣medy ellis {pro}uoke a laxe by a suppository craf¦tely Vse pipille pestilenciales for they be gode they be in thappoticary shoppes Also kepe fire al way in your hous. for it letteth moche thin pssions of the bodies aboue & clarefied thaier Also it is {pro}ffitable aswel for hole & seke fol∣kes to drinke Triacle: therfore take it .ij. ti¦mes a daye with clere wyn lymphat or with clere rosewater or with clere ale: Take a quā¦tite of tryacle of a pese & .ij. sponeful of clere wyn or rosewater or ale dissolue the triacle in the cuppe & drynke hit: & dyne not til the middes of the daye so that the tryacle may ha¦ue his op̄eracion then chese a gode disshe with mete & drynke clere wyn & often times dryn¦ke in the daye but not moche to gider for mo¦che habondaunce of drinke putrefieth the hu∣mours Also beware hote thinges in mete as pepir & garlik though pe{per} purgeth the brayn from flewme & specially the mēbres from vis∣cous humours yet it maketh moche hete and hete falleth into putrifaccion / bittnes only
is more to plese than hote odour or sauo. also garlik though it purgeth fleame & put out e∣uyl humour & {pro}uoked an appetite to ete & suf¦freth no drye ayer to entre: yet it troubleth the eyen & maketh the hede hote. therfore it is not gode to ete garlik The pestilēce groweth of ten times of an hote cause therfore all̄ metes the lighter they be of digestion somoche they be the better In the mornyng ete boilled mete / at euyn rosted / forbere broth & potage with∣out they he eygre In the time of pestilence ey∣gre metes be moche better thanne other metes. Also forbere al frutes but if they be eygre as cheryes or pomes garnates or a litil of a pere or apple by waye of medicine because al frute enduceth putrifaccion Ete conuenient spyces as gynger cynamum comyn matis & saffron These be the best sause that may be made for ri¦che peple For poure take rewe sage filberdnuts {per}celly with vinegre mynst to gider. These be gode & letteth putrifacciō To be mery ī the herte is a grete remedie for helth of body Therfore īn time of pestilence beware ye drede not deth: but lyue merely & hope to lyue longe
For the lettyng of blode Letting of blode ones ī the moneth may be made but aage or other thīg forbede it as pil¦gryms or feble {per}sons whiche haue the flixe suf¦fre to be lett blode ī the wyne called basilica on the right or lift side before eting & after īcision of basilica be mery & drinke wyne or ale tem¦peratly: slepe not that daye whan basilica is cutt Yf ye fele yow greued to be infect than es∣chewe slepe & be walking & moeuīg For by slepe thīward hete īduced poysō to the hert & to other special mēbres that vnethe any herbe may take away suche poysō whiche shold not be if a mā wold be meuīg to & fro But som wold axe wherfore slepe shal be eschewd. I say that ī pe¦stilence time anon after mete yf a body list to slepe then suche lust shalbe forborn̄ by a space wal¦king ī the gardyns or feldes & then make a na¦turell slepe by the space of an houre & therfore Auycenne writeth that if a mā wold slepe he must drinke a gode draught of ale or wyn befor because a man being a slepe draweth many hu¦mours & the euil humours be putt doun by thu¦mours of a gode draught But som wold aske
how may a mā fele when he is infect. I say that a mā whiche is enfect that day eteth not moche mete for he is replenisshed with euyl humoure & forthwith after dyn he hath lust to slepe & feleth grete hete vnder colde. also he hath grete payne ī the forhede / but all thse thīges he may putte away by moeuyng of a space hider & thider to ride or to walke he maye not for sleuthe of the body & the weyghte of the same Also a mā that is enfect hath lust to slepe euy houre of the day & night For the venym being within the body troubleth the spirite of lyff so that alwaye he wolde reste & slepe And also of these tokenes a man schal knowe & fele him self enfect. & yf a body will not beleue this / abide the middes of the daye & then he shal fele a swellīg vnder the arme or aboute the share or aboute the eerys & therfore see an hye & a gode medeane / forbere slepe because of tho thinges afore sayde & y is playne that the spirite of life resteth ī slepe & all the body here & there is venymed: All thse thinges I haue {pro}ued by my selfe These thīges knowen whā a mā feleth him self īfect assone as he may lett him be lett blode plenteously tyl
he be swoune then stoppe the wyne For a litil lettyng of blode moeueth or styreth venym: & yf it be so that a mā wil not haue many wy¦nes cutte to geder / then lett him suffre the wy¦ne cut to rēne til the blode withdrawe for a li¦til bledyng meueth strongly the venym as yt is sayde afore Also a man whether he be in¦fect or not yf he be lett blode / lett him forbere slepe al that day til midnight folowing & alle∣waye lett blode that wyne vpon that side of the body where the swellyng ap{per}eth Therfor yf a swellyng appere vnder the right arme lett blode ī the middes of the same arme ī the wy¦ne called mediana / yf it ap{per}e vnder the lift arme lett him blode in the middes of the same or in the vayne of the lyu whiche is aboute that litill fingre / & yf it be about the share / let hī blode about the hele vpon the same side yf the swelling he ī the necke let him blode in the vayne called Cephalica about the thōbe in the hande of the same side or in the vayne called mediana of the same arme: or in the hande of the same side about the litil fingre. And yf the swelling ap{per}e about the eere / let
him blode in the vayn called cephalica of the same side or in the vayne whiche is betwene the longe fingre & the thombe lest many vene¦mous vaynes go into the brayn or let blode the vayn whiche is about the litil finger na¦med by the phisicions Basilica. & if a swel∣ling ap{per}e in the sholdres lesse it with ventose¦te & first lesse the vayne called Mediana f the swelling be on the backe: lesse it upon the vayn called pedica maḡ & al these thinges be made yf a man slepe not before the knowleche of the swelling But yf ye fele suche swellyng after slepe then on the {con}trarie part the letinge of blode must be made As if the swelling ap∣{per}e in the right arme let him blode in the lifte arme in Epate or basilica or mediana. & yf a swelling ap{per}e vnder the lift arme let him blode in the right arme like as it is sayd of the lift arme: & so of other places of the body let blode on the {con}trarie part of suche swelling. & if the letting of blode be verray litil & feble then lette the pacient slepe after the middes of the daye and alway in the middes of the daye he must be in continuell meuyng ridynge or goynge
moderatly. & afterward yf the swellīg growe lete him not be aferde of deth be cause suche a swelling putteth out all euyll & maketh a mā verray hole. & that the soner a swellyng maye be made rype / take this medicine as foloweth Brose the leuys of an elder tree & putte therto grounde mustard & make a playster therof and put it vpon the swelling Sōme surgeons wil put triacle vpon the swellīg but do not so for triacle putteth out venym: therfore drinke tri¦acle for that putteth out the same: Also ther is another medicine Take sengrene hylworth otherwise called wilde time maudelyn gras plā¦teyn & a litil rye floure & breke all these to gi¦der til ye see water come out therof Medyl that water with womās mylke & gyue it to the pacient fasting before slepe & it wil werke to better for to remeue the swelling. Also for the swelling whan it ap{per}ed Take filberd not tes fygges & rewe: bruse them to gider & laye it vpon the swelling These remedies be suf¦ficient to eschewe this grete sekenesse with the helpe of god to whom be eulastīg laude & pray¦sing worlde withouten ende AMEN
