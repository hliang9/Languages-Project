The VVelchmans Lamentation for the losse of her creat Town, and City of Hereford. WHen her was peaten in Teane Forest pi her teadly foe, Sir William Wal∣ler, her was thought tat if her could keep her head and pody together till her got to Hereford to her hardy cosins and countrey-men there, her should pe in creat safe∣ty and security, especially when her was infor∣med her enemy was gone from her porders, and marched towards Oxford: for ten her was thought never to have seen her more in her own countrey, however not pefore her should pe so strong as to resist her, and save her sweet life from her sword, tat might make a separation be∣tween tat and te pody: put O Hone, her expe∣ctation was quite frustrate, and her was decei∣ved; for when her was think least of her com∣ing, her heard a strange noise, of Drums and Cuns apout te town, te very voice of te Cuns put her into a thousand desperations, her could
not tell which way to petake her selfe, nor how with any courage to run away from her teadly adversaries so near her: to fight her was not a∣ble, for her heart was tead pefore, even when her first heard of their approach: in this despe∣rate case her was constrained to call to her a Councell of Souldiers, called a Councell of War, which her had had too much on pefore; and indeed could never apide te same from te time of her nativity; but necessity has no law nor liberty neither in her countrey, wherefore nature directed her to save her sweet life pi one means or other, te beasts will do so; put rather ten her would turn to her foes, her would die; upon which her resolution after her had con∣gregated her cosins and countrey-men, prethren souldiers, her fell into these insuing consultati∣ons, and her self peing accounted te wisest in te Senate, her was tesired to teliver her sence, what her thought best to pe done for te present to save her self without fighting, if it were possible, and if not, nor no wayes for her to run away, ten to propound upon what contitions her should yeeld to her enemy, upon which after much in∣treaty knowing her selfe to have beene an old souldier at her house in her owne countrey, put
never in any fight till Teane pattell (where her was pitifully peaten) her was te more willing to performe their desires, presuming upon her owne experience, and terefore her propounded to their grave considerations tese particulars following: viz. 1 Let her advise her teer cosins and coun∣trey-men not to adventure their persons out of te town, put make te same her safety, and now & ten let pullets flie out from te houses among her enemies, and if her can make her provision last till some helpe and relief may pe sent pi her cosins in Wales, and so let her enemies waste teir pullets and powter in vaine, or with little disadvantage to her. 2 Let her privately make her friends ac∣quainted with her wants, and need of help at tis present against her adversaries, pi which tey may send her reliefe te sooner, put if her could procure any of te English Forces to come to her assistance, her doubted not put her should pi fighting make her party cood with her foes, put her touts her own countrey-men will not adventure teir precious plood in so desperate a combate as must make her enemies leave te town, for tey pe very fearfull to heare te sound
ofte Cuns, and many of tem her scares, will tie with te conceit tereof, pefore tey can come to her aid. 3 If no assistance come to her in time, ten her sence is, Tat her may endeavour privatly in to night at some secret place of te town, to run a∣way with her head on her shoulders, and if her can conveniently carie away any of her prog, to take te same away with her, tat her foes may have no advantage tereby when tey come into te town, and her would also if her could carie away with her her coods and arms. 4 If her may not with safety effect any of these things, ten her must pe constrained to yeeld up her town upon tese conditions, and terefore her conceives it necassary to propound to her enemies tese Propositions following, which being granted, her wilbe willing to leave te town, and save her life pi returning into her own countrey, where if once her has te fortune put to return, her will see all war and fighting at te Tevill, pefore her will adventure her selfe in such toings again, for her perceives her has had no successe in all her enterprizes according to her expectation; for her was think to have cot∣ten creat store of goods, and made her self rich
with te spoiles of te English put her was decei∣ved rein,  conditions for te surrendring up her town which her would have condescended unto, are tese ensuing, viz. 1 That her may have free liberty to co out of te town with her arms and ammunition, & pe conducted into her own countrey with a Passeport for her honest cariage when her shall be past te feare of her enemies, lest her should steal from her neighpour any coods, for her hands have been addicted to teevery, tat her doubts her shall not leave it so long as her live. 2 That her may have liperty to carry with her her pelly timber, as her coose, pacon, sheese, leek, poultrey, and all her prog to keep her alive and honest in her journey and march, and carri∣ages allowed her for that purpose. 3 That her maimed cosins and countrey∣men, and those that are lamed in te fight, may pe left in te town till tey pe recovered of their health, and able to travell into their owne countrey. 4 That her with all her fellow Officers may pepardoned and exempted from future questi∣oning and calling to account for her treas ca∣ble plots and actions against her countrey d
te English people, and her roppery and pilla∣ging of tem, contrary to te Lawes of te King∣dome, and against her owne liperty and free∣dome, for te which her posterity will curse her in time to come, when her shall bee tead and puried. If all these things be granted, her will go in∣to her own countrey, and pe jocund with her teer wife Shone, and her shildren, which was call tem Shinkin ap Evan, and Randall ap Mor∣gan, and live hereafter (if her enemies will let her alone) in peace and quiet, put if her cannot obtain of her soes tese conditions, ten her must take her fortune as it fals, whether i be to be hanged, killed, or imprisoned, or made slaves to her adversaries, te very conceit of either hath al∣most struck her with teath already, then must her take up her mourning song to the tune of O Hone, & sigh out her life with sorrow, that her Welch plood so hot of nature, tat it were able to fire mountains, and boyle te sea like a caul∣dron in her conceit, and tat her self was slay multitudes of armed men, should be now con∣fined to te pleasure of her foes, who if her were put with tem in te field, her could destroy tem with te preath of her pack parts as soone as pi fighting. FINIS.
