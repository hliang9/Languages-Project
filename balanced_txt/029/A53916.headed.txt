THE London Dispensatory, Reduced to the PRACTICE OF THE LONDON Physicians. Wherein are Contain'd The MEDICINES, BOTH Galenical and Chymical, That are now in Use. Those that are out of Use are Omitted: And such as are in Use, and not in the Latin Copy, are Added; with Vertues and Doses. By JOHN PECHEY, of the College of Physicians, in London. LONDON: Printed by F. Collins, for J. Lawrence, at the Angel in the Poultrey. 1694.
THE PREFACE. HAving for several years endeavoured to render the Art of Physick as plain and easie as the na∣ture of it would allow; by separating practice and ex∣perience from the vain fictions of a sort of men, whose business it is, to make every part of it obscure and mi∣sterious. I thought among other things, the reducing the London Dispensatory to the practice of the present times, and the adding to it such medicines as are fre∣quently used; would be a work very acceptable to those, that have not time or opportunity to peruse the prescrip∣tions of the London Physicians: To which end I care∣fully viewed the files of some London Apothecaries, and the bills of the most eminent Physicians, and re∣viewed the best modern Authors. Now by this Treatise young Phisicians may know what Medicines are used, and so prescribe according∣ly; whereas, before the Apothecaries were wnt to discover, and ridicule raw Practitioners for their ob∣solete and unfashionable Prescriptions; and common∣ly upon reading such bills would say, This or that Do∣ctor was a Novice in Practice.
And Apothecaries in the Country may by this Dispen∣satory provide Medicines that are agreeable to the pre∣sent practice, and so save the patient the trouble, (be∣sides the loss of time) in sending to London for some Medicines, prescribed by London Physicians, as oft as they are called into the Countrey, or advised with by letter in extraordinary cases: Tho I know some of themin great Towns especially, are well furnished with all things necessary. But (which is most considerable) tis probable, that many of the Simples and Compounds that are rejected and out of use, either never had really the virtues as∣signed them; or by a long tract of time, the diseases for which they were used are now altered, and some of them worn out; and that others succeed which require other Medicines and Methods of cure. As to the vir∣tues of each Composition, I have set down briefly those that I thought did peculiarly belong to the Medicine. Lastly, I have added a Table of diseases.
