Item, that no Parson, Vicar, or Curat, shall solemnize Matrimonie out of his or their Cure, or parish Church or Chappell: and shall not solem∣nize the same in priuate Houses, nor lawlesse or exempt Churches, vnder the paines of the Law, forbidding the same. And that the Curate haue their Certificates, when the parties dwell in diuers Parishes. Item, the nds of Matrimonie ought to be openly denounced to the Church by  Minister, three seuerall Sundayes or Feastiuall dayes, to the intent, that who will and can alledge any impediment, may be heard, and that stay may be made till further trial, if any exception be made there against it, vpon sufficient caution. 7 Item, who shall malitiously obiect a friuolous impediment against a lawful Matrimonie, to disturbe the same, is subiect to the paines of the Law. 8 Item, who shall presume to contract in the degrees prohibited (though he do it ignorantly) besides that the fruit of such copulation may be iudged vnlaw∣full, is also punishable at the Ordinaries discretion. 9 Item, if any Minister shall conioyne any such, or shalbe present at such con∣tracts making, ought to be suspended from his Ministerie for three yeeres: and otherwise to be punished according to the Lawes. 10 Item, it is further ordeined, that no Parson, Vicar, or Curat, do preach, treat, or expound, of his owne voluntarie inuention, any matter of contro∣uersie in the Scriptures, if he be vnder the degree of a maister of Art, except he be licensed by his Ordinarie therevnto, but onely for the instruction of the people, read the Homilies already set foorth, and such other forme of doctrine as shall be hereafter by authoritie published. And shall not innouate or alter any thing in the Church, or vse any olde rite or ceremony, which be not set foorth by publicke authoritie. Set foorth by the most reuerend Father in God, Mathew Archbishop of Canterburie, Primate of England, and Metropolitane. Imprinted at London for Edward White.
