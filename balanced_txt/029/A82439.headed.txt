WHereas the Inhabitants of both Nations that live near to the Mountains, and in Dales, and Marish and other obscure places upon the Borders, having been long accustomed to Idleness and Theft, whilest the two Nations were under several Governments, and cannot be brought off from their old evil and accustomed maner of Living, by reason of the scituation of their Habitations and Dwellings near to the great Bogs and Mountains, and Large Waste Grounds between England and Scotland, having thereby such opportunity, not onely at home to hide themselves and their Prey or Booties of stollen Goods, but also of Conveyance over the said Bogs, Mountains and Large Wastes out of the Nation where they commit these Felonies, into the other Nation, where their persons and stollen Goods are oftentimes shel∣tered
and received by persons of their own bad Quality and Confederacy, these Bordering People of both Nations thus serving each other by turns, so as it is very hard to bring these people to be responsible to Iustice, or to get them apprehended upon Iustices War∣rants to be brought to Trial and Iudgement, whereby they remain much encouraged and emboldened to continue in that their base and loose course of Living by Theft, to the great Infesting and Damage of the Bordering Counties of both Nations; For Remedy whereof, Be it Enacted by His Highness the Lord Protector and this present Parliament, and it is hereby Enacted and Ordained, That as to all the Bordering Counties and parts of England and Scotland, (viz.)
