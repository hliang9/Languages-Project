A BREVIATE Of the SUFFERING CASE of WILLIAM GOODERIDGE. Somer∣set JAmes Crosman, Vicar of Banwel, sues William Goode∣ridge Quaker, by Bill in the Exchequer; and for his not answering upon Oath, gets him imprisoned Thirteen Years: And then by a Second Bill in the Court, obtains himself to be admitted to swear his Tythes worth Six Pounds Ten Shillings per Annum, in all Seventy eight Pounds; when indeed worth but about Forty Shillings per Annum; And still taking Advantage upon his not Swearing, procures a Sequestration against the said Gooderidge, and are in possession of about one hundred and fifty Pounds Personal Estate, and his Real Estate of Sixty Pounds per Annum, for the Tythe of Seventy eight Pounds; when in strictness was demandable only Twen∣ty six Pounds, and his Cost of Twenty Pounds; And continues the said Gooderidge in Prison, and hath turn'd his Wife, a lame Woman out of Doors, and left both in a Ruinous and Suffering Condition; as by his Petition more at large will appear.
