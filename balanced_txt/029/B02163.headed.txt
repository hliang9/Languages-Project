To his Grace, His Majesties high Commissioner, and the Right Ho∣nourable the Estates of Parliament. The humble Petition of Sir William Campbell. Sheweth, That your petitioner hath walked these many years betwixt England and Scotland, living upon Charity, as is well known to His Majesties se∣cretary, and many others of this Honourable Assembly: And having now in his old age, not being able to Travel any more, taken himself to a Married Life, of purpose to get rest in his old Age: But by providence being redacted to Poverty, hath nothing to maintain Himself and his Wife, he hath row Married, being a poor Widow, the Relict of a Presbyterian Minister at Dor∣nock. It is therefore humbly craved your Grace, and Estates of Parliament, would out of Pity and Compassion, seriously consider an old Gentlemans condition, who never prejudged neither Church nor State, but kept himself as a Christian, tho' surprized by his Opposers; and in the last Government inno∣cently put in Prison, and a Goad of Iron put upon his Legs, which is well known to many, and was called a Cheat and a Rogue, which he resented; and as many knows he was inno∣cent: and allow him an yearly allowance during his life, for his maintainance. And this is the request of him, that will pray God to prosper His Majesty, and all His Forces by Sea and Land. God bless the Honourable Parliament, and grant you may do nothing, but what may tend to GOD'S glory, and the Nations good: And your Answer. If my request you do not grant, Your Money must be very scant: For as I live, I nothing crave But Charity, which I must have For to supplie my present need, Which I pray God you'l do with speed. God bless you all, both great and small, And so farewell onto you all. AMEN.
