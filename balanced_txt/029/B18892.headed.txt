The Sober Mans VINDICATION, Discovering the True Cause and Manner how Dr. Chamberlen came to be Reported Mad: Which Scandal they propagated throughout England, Wales and Ireland, and the same false Report was met with in Scotland, France and the Low Countries. He that hath an Ear to Hear, let him HEAR. I PETER CHAMBERLEN, a Servant of the Most High, through the Mercies of Jesus Christ▪ First Physician to the Royal Progeny, and in Ordinary to His Sacred Majesty: To Discharge My Conscience towards God, my Duty, Love and Faithfulness to my Royal Master, to the Parliament, and to my Na∣tive Countrey. Do Testifie, in Presence of God, Angels and Men, that the WOES given me to Denounce against the Bloody City, against the Presbyteean Ministers and Lawyers, and against the Idol Parlia∣ment, the Bloody Parliament, when they had ALL the POWER in Their Hands, and thought Themselves IMMOVEABLE and SECURE: Sending it with the Sign of the Bloody Arm to the Lord Major, and to the Speaker that then were, God hath (in part) Fulfilled, to the Amazement of the World. Because they De∣spised Warning from the Lord, and Counsel to SAVE Many Thou∣sand LIVES and SOULS: Calling Publick things Private, and Private things they called Publick, Branding Me with the Report of Madness, which Fools and Others Believe, and report to this Day. But God hath returned the Madness on their own heads, though it was my portion then for Disobedience, because (to avoid the Censure of Madness) I did not personally Proclaim the Woes with a Naked Bloody Arm, and Bare feet, from the Royal Exchange to Westmin∣ster-Hall. Now let all men Judge, whether the Woes are not come to pass in a great measure. When the City was brought under the Power of the Sword? Her Magistrates Disgrac't, Displac't, and Others in Their room, at the Lust, and Pleasure, or Discretion of the strongest Weapon? But they are not yet Burnt or Massacred (as some Feared, and Others Maliciously reported they should be) by Ana∣baptists: What they may be by Others of their Own Chusing, if they repent not, is not for me to Determine. Were not some Woes fulfilled on the Presbyterian Ministers, when Some were Beheaded, Some forced to recant for their Lives, and Many turn'd Independents: and All at this day in Present Danger of Per∣jury for Compelling Their Scottish Covenant? Were not also the Lawyers Termes made Vacation, the Inns of Court Desolate, Inhabited by a few Women and Landresses, and Lawyers Gownes Threatned to be Hung up by the Scottish Co∣lours? But were not the Woes fulfilled most of all against the PAR∣LIAMENT so often Pieced and Made up till it became like Sir Francis Drakes Ship (scarce one Planck left of the Old One) yet at last broken up, then Whistled for again by the Souldiers, and Broken up again, and by Some of Themselves, with others, revil'd into the Stinck and Scorn of a Rump? Are not All their Members Scattered; their Names Blotted with Ignominy, Some Imprisoned, and Some brought to the Grave in Blood and Sorrow? Not that I dare Judge them Greater Sinners than Those, on whom the Tower of Shilo fell: for the Words of our Saviour are, UNLESS YE REPENT, YE SHALL ALL LIKEWISE PERISH. The Arm of the Lord is not shortned. There is yet a Cup of Trembling in the Hand of the Lord. Many great Works may yet be done, which are not. I SWEAR (with my Right Hand lift up towards Heaven, in All fear and Awful Reverence) By HIM that LIVETH for Ever and Ever. That Made Heaven, Earth and Sea, and All that Therein is. 1. THREE THOUSAND LIVES a year may be SAVED. 2. THE PLAGUE (monaced by Astrologers) PREVEN∣TED. 3. DISTEMPERS of the NATIONS HEALED. 4. THE Numerous POOR MAINTAINED. 5. AND some GLEANINGS of the HARVEST and VINTAGE (which might have filled the King's Coffers) IMPROVED. If His Majesty and Parliament, Judge these things Publick, or Ne∣cessary; They have more Right and Power to Command My At∣tendance (who am in subjection and but ONE) then I have Abili∣ty, Wisdom, or Polity, to know their Leisure, and to Solicite them ALL (who are MANY, and in HIGH PLACES.) But if I be not Credited, and for WANT of them any Judgements happen, Their own Conscience will Clear me before the GRAND TRIBUNAL; where we must All Appear. To God onely Wise and Good be All Glory. AMEN. FEAR GOD. HONOUR THE KING. From my Cottage over against the Low Conduit by the Church in Coleman∣street, 1662. London, Printed by Jane Clowes, 1662.
