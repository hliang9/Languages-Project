A Louer forsaken, Of his best Beloued. To an excellent new Court Tune. IOy to the person of my Loue Although that she doth me disdaine, Fixt are my thoughts, And cannot remoue: But yet I loue in vaine. Shall I lose the sight. Of my ioy and hearts delight, Or shall I cease my suit; Shall I striue to touch; Oh no, that were too much, She is forbidden fruit. Ah woe is me, That euer I did see The beauty that did me bewitch, But now alas I must forgoe The treasure I esteemd so much. Oh whither shall my sad heart go; Or whither shall I flie; Sad eccho shall resound my plaint Or else alacke I needs must dye. Shall I by her liue, That no life to me will giue, But deadly wounds my heart; If I flie away, O will she not cry stay, My sorrow to conuert; Oh, no, no, no, She will not doe so, But comfortlesse I must be gone: But ere I goe, To friend or foe, Ile loue her, or I will loue none. A thousād good fortunes fall to her share Although she hath forsaken me, & fil'd my sad heart full of despaire, Yet euer will I constant be, For she is the Dame. My tongue shall euer name, For branch of modestie. Chast in heart and minde, Oh were she halfe so kinde, Then would she pitty me. Oh turne againe, Be kinde as thou art faire, And let me in thy bosome dwell, So shall I gaine The treasure of Louēs paino, Till then, my dearest Loue, farewell. FINIS.
