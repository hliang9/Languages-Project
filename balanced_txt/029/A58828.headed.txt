THE PREFACE. Courteous Reader, THIS following Narrative has run all the hazards and risks of For∣tune, it breathed for a long time in the obscure Shadow of a Coun∣try and Loyal DIVINES Study, after the death of that Worthy and Eminent person, a Relation to the Great E. of Strafford, it fell into the ands of One of his Younger Sons, who being a Man of Business, and a da∣ty Frequenter of Westminster-Hall, that Great Mart and Exchange of Law, This lay hundled up, among some bundles of insigniicant and Worthless Pa∣pers, till it pleased God to confine this Gentleman to his Chamber, by a Distem∣per, which though it was so severe as to deny him to Act abroad, yet it did not so at home: Under this Imprisonment (for Restraint is such to Active Spirits) He reviewed His long neglected Writings, and being unwilling like the Rable of the Town, to condemn and exceute upon a bare Presumption of Guilt: He calls all to a single Scrutiny and Examination: The Multitude here, as in the World, proved Trash and Refuse, only this Manuscript, like Moses among the Reeds, was preserved alive, because it was of a very fair and beautiful Countenance: Perils and Manifold Sorts of Death attend Writings as well as their Authors, and Gods Providence is as legible in the extraordinary Preservation of useful and profitable BOOKS, as in Raising up and Pro∣tecting PERSONS of invincible Resolution and Courage, to be the pub∣lcik Instruments of the Churches and Kingdoms Deliverance; Of this ad∣vantageous Nature and Consideration, I take these following Sheets to be, for herein are evidently discoursed and unridled the Designs of the Spanish Match, the Strategems of the comprehensive Statesman Gondamore, and of his faithful Adherents the JESUITES; for the Introduction of his Masters Reli∣gion and Empire into these Nations together, the Negotiations betwixt Spain and Great Britain were, in King James Raign; the unaccountable State-Se∣crets and Mysteries, These exercised and distressed the Combin'd Heads and Wits of our Great Council, raised the Fears and Jealousies of the People, and prepa∣red them to entertain those groundless Suggestions, which afterward both gave Rise and Support to our late Civil Wars. The Designs of the Catholick Bi∣shop and Monarck, in all these Treaties of Mariage, were to enslave us to a False and Foppish Religion and a Tyrannical Government, and though Pretences of Commerce and Friendship swom at the Top, yet these were the great Mo∣tives, which lay at the Bottom. To compass these, Perjuries and the Violation of the Mariage-Oath with an Heretical Prince, would be a Sacred and Meritorious A∣ction,
and if the Antichristian Beast could be drawn in, as the Giant did the Cat∣tle into his Den, backward, and by the Tayl, 'tis no matter, how much Reason and Morality is affronted; nay, His Holiness, out of the Plenitude of his Power, will Indulge his faithfullest Adherents to renounce even in extremis at the very point of Death, Some Essential and Reproachful Arti∣cles of their Faith (as the Lawfulness of De∣posing Vid. Concil. Lateran. magnum sub Innocentio 30. Can. 30. de Hereti∣cis, where the Legality of the Popes Power to Depose Princes is asserted, and this Declaration thus Authoritively made (de∣nyed by the late dying CON∣SPIRATORS) is a sufficient Ground of Falth, except They will Grant, the Catholick Church both Representative and Ver∣tual to be Fallible, which Con∣cession vvould stab Popery in its Vitals, and kill it at a Blow. Kings and Soveraign Princes) that the whole System may with the less Sus∣pition be glibly swallowed down and enter∣tained. The Dimensions of Hercules were exactly calculated by the measure of his Foot, and the Magnitude of a Limb may discover to the Intelligent the true Bulk of a Sume∣trical and well built Body; and the horrid Lies and Immoralities, Rapines and Murders, Assassinations and Massacres approved of in This small Pamphlet, for the Effecting of the Romish DESIGN, may sufficiently Instruct such (of the villanous and pernicious Nature of the whole) as have cast out the Two Devils of Prejudice and of a blind and implicite Faith in that Arch-Fanatick of Europe and Divider of Kingdoms; for he it is (and for this Lesson I must acknowledg my self intirely indebted to this Paper) who sows the Tares of Divi∣sion betwixt the Gown-men of this Nation: Sets the Lawyer to quarrel the Divine: The Two Temples to deprecate the Church, and Westminster-Hall to envy the Princely and Magnificent Structure of the Abby. Read This DISCOVERY with Seriousness, and I am confident, it will prove very Instructive in many Important Particulars: 'Twas its Misfortune to lie so long in obscurity, and so was it too to breath first of all in an Air, infected with the Stench of such an infinite Number of puny, insect and Imperfect Libels: Here is nothing in this but what is Masculine, the Argument is weighty, the Style passant and expressive, the Discovery of the Popish DESIGNS in that Juncto of Af∣fairs clear and palpable, and that it may be serviceable in this to the Publick-weal is the Only Design and hearty Wish of Him, Who is Reader, A hearty Well-willer to the Wellfare and Prosperity of this NATION RICHARD DUGDALE.
A NARRATIVE OF THE Popish Strategems Carried On by Seigniour GONDAMORE THE SPANISH EMBASSADOR, &c. HIS Catholick Majesty having given Commandment, that presently upon the Return of Seigniour GONDAMORE, the Leiger Embassador from ENGLAND, a special meeting of the Principal States of Spain, who were of his Councel, together with the Presidents of the Council of Castile, of A∣ragon, of Italy, of Portugal, of the Indies, of the Treasure of War, and es∣pecially of the Holy Inquisition, should be held at Monson in Arragon, the Duke of Lerma, being appointed President, who should make Declaration of his Majesties pleasure, take an Account of the Embassadors Service, and consult touching the STATE and RELIGION respectively, to give satisfaction to his Holiness's Nuntio, who was desired to make one in this Assembly, concern∣ing Overtures of Peace and Amity with the English, and other Catholick Princes, which might engender Suspicion and Jealousie betwixt the Pope and his Ma∣jesty; if the Mystery were not unfolded, and the ground of those Counsels discovered aforehand: This made all men expect the Embassadors Return with a kind of Longing, that they might behold the Issue of this Meeting, and see what good for the Catholick Cause the Embassadors Employment had effected in England, answerable to the general opinion received of his Wisdom, and what further project would be set on foot to become matter for publick Dis∣course. At length he Arrived, and had present notice given him from his Majesty, That before he came to Court, he should give up his Account to this Assem∣bly, which Command he gladly received, as an earnest of his acceptable Service, and gave Thanks, that for his Honour he might publish himself in so judicious a presence.
He came first upon the day appointed to the Councel Chamber; not long af∣ter all the Councel of State, and the President met, there wanted only the Duke of Lerma and the Popes Nuntio, who were the Head and Feet of all the Assem∣bly. These two stayed long away for divers respects: The Nuntio, that he might express the greatness of his Master, and loose the See of Rome no re∣spect by his Over-ght, but that the benches might be full at his Approoch. The Duke of Lerma to express the Authority and Dignity of his own Person, and to shew how a Servant put in place of his Master exacts more service of his Fellow-Servants than the Master himself. These two stayed till all the rest were weary of waiting, but at length the Nuntio supposing all the Council sat, launced forth and came to Roade in the Council Chamber, where after mutual discharge of Duty from the Compa∣ny, and blessing upon it from him, he sate down in solemn silence, grieving at his oversight, when he saw the Duke of Lerma absent, with whom he strove as a Competitor for Pomp and Glory. The Duke had sent before, and understood of the Nuntio's being there, and stayed something the longer, That his boldness might be observed, wherein he had his desire; for the Nuntio having a while, patiently driven away the time with several Complements to several Persons, had now almost run his Pa∣tience out of breath; but the Duke of Villa Hermosa (President of the Coun∣cil of Arragon) fed his humour by the discharge of his own discontentment, upon the occasion of the Duke of Lerma his absence, and beckoned Seigniour Gondamore to him, using this speech in the hearing of the Nuntio, after a sport∣ing manner. How unhappy are the People, where you have been; first, for their Souls, being Hereticks, then for their Estates, where the name of a Favourite is so fa∣miliar? How happy is our Estate, where the Keys of Life and Death are so easily come by (pointing at the NUNTIO) hanging at every Religious Girdle, and where the door of Justice and Mercy stand equally open to all Men, without respest of Per∣sons: The Embassadour knew the Ironical stroak to be intended as a by-blow to the Nuntio, but fully at the Duke of Lerma (whose greatness began now to wax heavy towards Declension) and therefore he returned this Answer, Your Excellency knoweth the State is happy, where wise Favourites govern Kings, if the Kings themselves be foolish, or if the wiser Sort will not yet be govern'd by them, The STATE of ENGLAND (howsoever you hear of it in Spain or Rome) is so happy in the last kind, they need not care much what the Favourite be (though for the most part, he be such as prevents all Suspition in that kind, being rather chose as a Scholar to be taught than a Tutor to teach) of this they are sure no Prince exceeds theirs in personal Abilities, so that nothing could be added to him in my wish, but this one, He were our Vassayle and a Catholick. With that the noise without gave notice of the Duke of Lerma his entrance, at whose first Approach the whole House arose, though some latter than o∣thers, as if some had hung Plummets on them to keep them down, the Nun∣tio only sate unremoved: the Duke received the Obeysance of the rest with a familiar, kind of carriage to high for Courtesie, as one not neglecting such demeanors, but expecting it, and after a Filial observance to the Popes Nuntio, sate down as President under the Cloath of State, but somewhat lower, then after a Space given for admiration, preparation and attention.
The PRESIDENTS Speech, requiring the Embassador to give an Account of his PLOTS and wicked INTREAGUES against ENGLAND, and what Success he met with. THe King my Master (holding it more honourable to do, than to dis∣course, to take from you the Expectation of Oratory, used rather in Schools and Pulpits than in Councels) hath appointed me President in this holy, wise, learned and noble Assembly, a man naturally of a slow Speech, and not desirous to quicken it by Art or Industry, as holding Action only proper to a Spaniard, as I am by Birth, to a Souldier as I am by Profession, to a King as I am by Representation, take this therefore briefly for a Declaration, both for the Cause of this Meeting, and my Master his further pleasure. There hath been at all times from the Worlds foundation, one Chief Comman∣der, or Monarch upon the Earth, this needs no further proof than a back-look∣ing into our own Memories and Histories of the World, neither now is there a∣ny question (except with Infidels and Hereticks) of that one Chief Commander in Spirituals, in the Unity of whose Person, the Members of the visible Church is included, but there is some doubt of the Chief Commander in Temporals, (who as the Moon to the Sun) might govern by night, as this by day, and by the Sword of Justice, compell to come in, or ut of, such as infringe the Authority of the Keys: This hath been so well understood long since by the inallible Chair, as that thereby upon the Declension of the Roman Emperours, and the Increase of Romes Spiritual Splendour (who thought it unnatural, that their Suns should be sublunary) our Nation, was by the Bishop of Rome selected before other People, to conquer and rule other Nations with a Rod of Iron, and our Kings to that end adorned with the Stile of Catholik Kings, as a Name above all Names under the Sun, (which is) under Gods Vicar General himself the Catho∣lick Bishop of Souls: To instance this point by comparison, look first upon the Grand Seignior, the Great Turk, who hath a large Title but not universal, for besides that he is an Infidel, his command is confin'd within his own Territories, and he is not stil'd Emporor of the World, but of the Turks and of their Vassayles, only among Christians the Defender of the Faith was a glorious Stile, whilst the King to whom it was given by his Holiness continued worthy of it, but it stood not in the truth, neither yet those that succeeded him; and besides it was no great thing to be call'd what every good Christian ought to be, Defendor of the Faith, no more than to be stiled with France the most Christian King, wherein he hath the greatest part of his Title common with most Christians. The Emperor of Russia,
Rome and Germany extend not their Limits further than their Stiles, which are local, only my Master the most Catholik King is for the Dominion of Bodies, as the Universal Bishop for the Dominion of Souls over all that Part of the World, which we call America, (except where the English Intruders usurp) and the grea∣test Part of Europe, with some Part of Asia and Africa by actual Possession, and over all the rest by real and indubitable Right, yet acknowledgeth his Right to be derived from the free and Fatherly Donation of his Holiness, who (as the Sun to the Moon) bestows Lustre by Reflection, to this Kingdom, to this King of Kings, my Master; what therefore he hath, howsoever gotten, he may keep and hold; what he can from any other King, or Commander, by any Stratagem of War, or pretence of Peace he may take, for it is theirs only by Usurpation, except they hold of him, from whom all Civil Power is derived, as Ecclesiastical from his Holiness: what the Ignorant call Treason, if it be on his behalf, is Truth; if a∣gainst him, it is Treason: And thus all our Peace, our War, our Treaties, Mar∣riages, or whatsoever Intendment else of Ours, Aimes at this Principal End, to get the whole Possession of the World, and to reduce all to Unite under our Tem∣poral Head, that our King may truly be, what he is stiled the Catholick and Universal King: As Faith therefore is Universal, and the Truth Universal, yet so as they be under our Head the Pope, whose Seat is, and must necessarily be, at Rome, where St. Peter sate; so must all men be Subject to Our and Their Catholick King, whose Particular Seat is here in Spain, he is Univer∣sal every where, and almost made Natural, so that by a Key of Gold, by In∣telligence, or by way of Confession, my Master is able to unlock the Secrets of every Prince, and to withdraw their Subjects Allegiance, as if they knew Themselves more my Masters Subjects in Truth, than Theirs, whom Their Birth hath taught to miscall Soveraigns, we see this in France and in England, and especially, where all at once they learn to obey the Church of Rome, as their Mother, to acknowledge the Catholick King, as their Father, and to hate their Own King as an Heretick and Usurper: So we see Religion and the State coupled together, laugh and weep, flourish and fade, and participate of ei∣thers Fortunes, as growing upon one Stock of Policy: I speak this the more bold∣ly in this Presence; because I speak here before none but Natives, Persons who are Partakers, both in Themselves and Issues of the Triumphs, above all those of Antient Rome, and therefore such (as besides their Oaths) it concerns to be secret, neither need we refrain this Freedom of Speech from the Nuntio his Pre∣sence; because, besides that he is a Spaniard by Birth, He is also a JESUITE by Profession, an Order raised by the Providence of Gods VICAR, to accomplish this Monarchy the better, All of Them being Appropriate thereunto,
and as Publick Agents and Privy Councellors to this end; wherein the Wisdom of the State is to be beheld with Admiration; that as in Tem∣poral War it imploys, or at least trusts none, but Natives in Castile, Portu∣gal and Arragon: So in Spirituals, it imploys none but JESUITES, and so imploys them, that they are generally reputed, how remote soever they are from us, how much soever obliged to Others, still to be Ours, and still to be of the Spanish Faction, though they be Polonians, English, French, and resi∣ding in the Countrys or Courts: The Penitent therefore, and all with whom they deal and converse in their Spiritual Traffique must needs be so too, and so our Catholick King must needs have an Invisible Kingdom, and an un∣known number of Subjects in all Dominions, who will shew themselves and their Faith by their works of Disobedience, whensoever we shall have occasion to use their Jesuitical Vertue and Policy: This therefore being the principal end of all our Counsels; (according to those Holy Directions of that late Pious King PHILIP the Second, to his Son succeeding) to advance the Catholick Roman Religion, and the Catholick Spanish Dominion together. We are now met by His Majesties Command to take an account of you, (Seignior GONDA∣MORE)) who have been Embassador for England, to see what good you have effected there, towards the advancement of this work; and what further projects shall be thought fit to be set on foot to this end; and this breifly is the occasion of our meeting. Then the Embassador, who attended bare-headed all the time, with alow Obeysance, began thus, This laudable Custome of our King in bringing all Officers to such an ac∣count, where a Review is taken of good and bad services, upon the Deter∣mination of their Imployments, resembles those Roman Triumphs appointed for the Souldiers; and as in them it provoked to Courage, So in us it stirs up to diligence, our Master converseth by his Agents with all the World, yet with none of more Regard than the ENGLISH, where matter of such diversity is presented (through the several Humours of the States, and those of our Religion and Faction) that no Instruction can be sufficient for such Negotiations, but
much must be left in trust to the Discretion, Judgment, and Diligence of the Incumbent; I speak this not for my own Glory I having been restrained and therefore deserved meanly; but to forwarn on the behalf of others, that there may be more Scope allowed them to deal in, as occasion shall require; Breifly this Rule delivered by His Excellency was the Card and Compass by which I sayled, to make profit of all Humours, and by all means to advance the State of the Romish Faith, and Spanish Faction, together upon all advantages of Oaths and the breach of them; for this is an old Observation and a true one, that for Piety to Rome his Holiness did not only give, but bless us, in the Con∣quest of the New World, and thus in our pious Observance, we hope still to be Conquerors of the Old; and to this end, whereas His Excellency in his excellent Discourse seems to extend our outward Forces and private Aims, only against Hereticks, and to restrain them with true Amity with these of the Romish Reli∣gion: this I affirm that since there can be no security, but such Princes though now Romish Catholicks may turn Hereticks hereafter, my Aimes have ever been to make profit of all, and to make my Mr. Master of all, who is a faithful and constant Son of his Mother ROME; and to this end I beheld the Endeavours of our Kings of happy memory, how they have atcheived Kingdoms and Con∣quests by this Policy, rather than by open Hostility, and that without difference, as well from their Allies and Kinsfolks, men of the same Reli∣gion and Profession; such as were those of Naples, France and Navar, though I do not mention Portugal now united to us, nor Savoy, (that hardly fly'd from us) as of an Adverse and Heretical Faith, neither is this Rule left off, as the present Kingdom of France, the State of Venice, the Low Countries and Bohe∣mia (now all labouring for Life under our PLOTS) apparently manifest; this way therefore I bent my Engines in ENGLAND, as your Honours shall parti∣cularly hear; I shall not need to repeat a Catalogue of the Services I have here done, because this State hath been acquainted with many of them heretofore, by Entercourse of Letters, and Messengers; these only I will speak of that I have of late done, since the return of the Lord Roos from hence, and may seem most directly to tend to those ends formerly propounded by his Excellency that is, the Advancement of the Spanish State, and Romish Religion together: First it is well observed by the Wisedom of our State, that the King of England (who is other∣wise one of the most accomplish'd Princes that ever Reigned) extreemly hunts after Peace and so affects the true name of a Peace-maker, as that for it he will do or suffer any thing, and withall they have beheld the general boun∣ty and munisicence of his Mind, and necessity of the State so exhausted, as it is unable to supply his desires, who seeks to have that he may give to others, u∣pon these advantages they have given out directions, and instructions both to me and others, and I have observed them as far as I was able. And for this purpose, whereas there was a Marriage propounded betwixt them and us; ((how soever I suppose our State too devout to deal with Hereticks in this kind in earnest) yet I made that a Cover for much Intelligence, and a means to obtain what I desired, whilst the State of England longed after the Marriage, hoping thereby (though vainly) to setle Peace, and fill the Exchecquer; Here the Aroh-Bishop of Toledo, Inquisitor-General, stept up and interrupted Gondamore, saying that Marriage was not to be thought on, first for Religions sake, lest they should endanger the Soul of the Young Lady, and the rest of her Company
might become Hereticks. Secondly, for the State, least by giving so large a Portion to Hereticks, they should enrich and enable themselves for War, and impoverish and weaken the Catholicks. To the first Objection the Popes Nio answered, that his Holiness for the Catholick Cause would dispence with the Marriage; and urged these following Reasons. First that there was Valuable Danger, in the hazarding of One for the gaining of Many, perhaps of all. Secondly that it was no hazard since Women (especially Young Ones) are too obstinate to be removed from their Opinions, and abler to win Solomon to their Opinions, than Solomon to work them to his Faith. Thirdly it was great advantage to match with such, from whom they might break at pleasure, having the Catholick Cause for a Colour, and besides if need were, to be at liberty in all respects, since there was no Faith to be kept with Hereticks; and if his Holiness may dispence with the Murder of such, and dispose of their Crowns, as what good Catholick doubts but he may; much more he may, and will he in their Marriages, to prevent the Lepro∣sy-Seed of Heresy, and to setle Catholick-Blood in the Chair of State: to the se∣cond Objection the Embassador himself answered, saying, that though the English generally loathed the Match, and would as he thought buy it off with half their Estates, hating the Nation of Spain, and their Religion (as appears by an uproar and assault a day or two before his Departure from London by the Ap∣prentices, being greedy to vent their own Spleen, in doing him or any of his a mis∣cheif) yet two sorts of People unmeasureably desired the Match might proceed. First, the begging and beggarly Courtiers that they might have to furnish their Wants. Secondly, The Romish Catholicks, who hoped thereby, at least, for a Moderation of Fines, and Laws, perhaps a Toleration; and perhaps a total Restauration of their Religion in England; in which regard quoth he, I have known some Zealous Persons protest; that if all their Friends, and half their Estates could procure the Service of our Lady; if she came to be married with the Prince they would use the means faithfully to ight under her Colours when they might safely do it, and if it came to Portion they would under-hand contribute largly of their Estates to the Spanish Collector, and make up half the Portion of themselves, perhaps more: So by this Marriage it might be so wrought, that the State should be rather robb'd, and weakened (which is our Aim) than streng∣thened; as the English vainly hope; besides in a small time they should work so far in the Body of the State by buying Offices and the like, either by Sea or Land; of Justice Civil or Ecclesiastical, in Church or State, (all being for Money exposed to Sale) that with the Help of Jesuites they would undermine with meer wit, (without Gunpowder) and leave the King but a few Subjects, whose Faith he might rely upon, while they were of a Faith adverse to his: For what Catholick-Body that is sound at the Heart, can abide a Corrupt and Heretical Head, or Ruler? With that the Duke Medina des Rio Setto President of the Coun∣cil of War, and of the Council of State rose up and said, His Predecessors had felt the Force and Wit of the English, in 88. and he had cause to doubt the Ca∣tholicks themselves that were English, and fully Jesuited, upon any Foreign Nation, would rather take part with their own King, though an Heretick, than with his Catholick-Majesty a Stranger. The Embassador desired him to be of another mind, since, First for
their Persons, generally their Bodies, by long disuse for Arms were disabled, and their Minds effeminated, by Peace and Luxury, far from what they were in 88. when they were flesht in our Blood, and made haughty in Customary Conquests; and for the affection of those whom they call Rcusants, (quoth he) I know the bitterness of their inveterate malice; and have seen so far into their Natures, as I dare say, they will be for Spain against all the world; yea, (quoth he) I assure your Honours, I could not imagine so basely of their King and State, as I have heard them speak; nay, their Rage hath so perverted their Judgments, that what I my self have seen and heard from their King beyond Admiration, even to Astonishment, they have sleighted, misreported scorned, and perverted to his disgrace, and my rejoycing; magnifying in the mean time our defect for grace. Here the Duke Pastrane, President of the Counsel, for Italy; steps up and said he had lately read a Book of one Cambdens called his Annals; wherein writing of a Treaty of a Marriage long since, between English Elizabeth, and the French Duke of Andiou: He there observes, that the Marriage was not seriously intended on either side, but Politickly pretended by both States counterchangeably, that each might effect their own ends, there the English had the better; and I have some cause to doubt, since they can dissemble, as well as we; that they have their Aimes under hand as well as we; and intend the Match as little as we do, and this (quoth he) I believe the rather because the King as he is wise to consult and con∣sider; so he is a constant Master of his word, and hath written, and given strong Reasons against Matches made with Persons of contrary Religion; which Reasons no other Man can answer: And therefore doubtless he will not go from, nor counsel his Son to forsake those Rules laid down so deliberately. Your Excellency mistakes; (quoth the Embassador) the advantage was then on the Side of the English, because the French Men sought the Match; now it must be upon ours, because the English seek it, who will grant any thing rather than break off; and besides, they have no Patience to temporise and disem∣ble, in this or any other Design, as the French long since have well observed; for their necessities will give them neither time nor rest, nor hope elsewhere to be supplyed. As for their King, I cannot search into his heart, I must be∣lieve others that presume to know his mind, hear his words, and read his wri∣tings, and these relate what I have delivered: But for the rest of the People, as the number of those, that are truly religious, are ever the least for the most part of least account: so is it there, where if an equal Opposition be made betwixt their truly Religious and Ours, the remainder will be the greatest number and will stand indifferent, and fall to the greatest Side, where there is most hope of Gain, and Glory: for those two are the Gods of the Magnitude, and of the Multitude: Now these see apparently no certain Supplies for their wants, but from us. Yes, quoth the Duke, for even now you said the General-State loathing the Match, would redeem the fear thereof, with half their Estates: It is there∣fore but calling a Parliament, and the Business were soon effected. A Parlia∣ment (quoth the Embassador) nay, therein lies one of the Principle-Services I have done, in working such a Dislike between the King and the Lower-House: by the Endeavour of that Honourable-Earl and Admirable-Engine, a sure Servant to
us, and the Cause whilst he lives, as the King will never endure a Parliament again, but rather suffer absolute want, than receive conditional releif from his Subjects: the Matter was so curiously carried the last Parliament, that is in the Powder-PLOT, the Fact effected should have been imputed to the Puritans, the (greatest Zelots of the CALVINIAN-Sect) so the Propositions which damn up the Proceedings of this Parliament (howsoever they were invented by Roman Catholicks, and by them invented to disturb that Session) yet were propounded in favour of the Puritans, as if they had been hammored in their Forge, which very Name and Shadow the King hates: it being a sufficient Aspersion to disgrace any Person, to say he is such, and a sufficient Bar to stop any Suit, and utter∣ly to cross it, to say it smels of, or enclines to, that Party: moreover there are so many about him, which blow this Coal fearing their own States. If a Parli∣ament should enquire into their Actions, they use all their Art, and Industry to withstand such a Council: perswading the King he may rule by his absolute Pre∣rogative, without a Parliament: and thus furnish himself by a Mariage with us, and by other Domestick Projects without Subsidies, when leaving off Subsi∣dies, and Taxes have been the only use Princes have made of such: and where∣as some Free-minds among them, resembling our Nobility; who prefer the Priviledg of Subjects against Sovereign Invasion; call for the Course of the Common-Law; (a Law proper to their Nation) there is other time Servers cry the Laws down, and up the Prerogative; whereby they pray upon the Subjects by their Suites, and Exactions; mulct the State, and keep it poor; procure them∣selves much Suspioion amongst the Better and Judicious Sort, and hate a∣mongst the oppressed Commons; And yet if there should be a Parliament such a course is taken, as they shall never chuse their Sheire Knights and Bur∣gesses freely, who make the better-half of the Body thereof; for these being to be elected, by most Voices of the Free-Holders in the Country, where such Electi∣ons are to be made, are carried which way the Great Persons who have Lands in these Countries please; who by their Letters command their Ten∣nants Followers and Friends, to nominate such as adhere to them, and for the most of them are our Faction; and respect their own benefit and gain, rather than their Countries-Good: yea the Country People themselves, will every one stand, for the Great-Man their Lord, or Neighbour, or Master, whithout regard of his Hone∣sty, Wisdom and Religion. That which they aim at, (as I am assured by faithful Intelligence) is to please their Landlords, and to renew their Lease, in which regard they will betray their Country and Religion too: and Elect any Man that may most profit their Particular: Therefore it is unlikely there should be a Parliament, and impossible the Kings Debts should be paid, his Wants suffici∣ently repaired, and left himself ful-handed by such a Course: and indeed (as it is generally thought) by any other course than with a Marriage with us: for which Cause whatsoever Project we list to attempt, enters safely at the door, whilst their Policy lyes asleep, and will not see the danger, I have made try∣al of these Particulars, and found few Exceptions in these general Rules; Thereby I and their own wants together have kept them from furnishing their Navy, which being the Wall of their Island, and once the strongest in Chri∣stendom lies now at road, unarm'd and fit for ruine: If ever we doubted their strength by Sea, now we need not, there are but few ships or men able to
look abroad, or to live in a storm much less in a Sea fight. This I effected by buzing in their Ears, The furnishing a Navy bred suspition in my Master, and so would avert his mind from this Match, the hope of which rather than they would loose, they would almost loose their hope of Heaven. Secondly, All their Voyages to the East Indies I permitted rather with a co∣lourable resistance, than a serious; because I see them not helpful but hurt∣ful, to the State in general; carrying out Gold and Silver, bringing home Spice, Silks, Feathers and such like Toyes: an insensible wasting the Common Stock of Coyn and Bullion, whilst it fills the Custom House, and some Private Houses, who thereby are unable to keep this Discomodity on foot, by Bribes especially: So many Great Persons being Venturers and Sharers in the Gain: besides this wast∣eth the Mariners, not one of ten returning, which I am glad to hear; for they are the Men we stand in fear of, as for the West-Indian Voyages I withstood them in earnest, because they began to inhabit there, and to fortifie themselves, and may in time there perhaps raise another England to withstand a New Spain in A∣merica: As this Old England opposeth our State, and clouds the glorious extent thereof in Europe: Besides, there they trade for Commodities, without wast of their Treasure, and often return Gold for Knives, Glasses, or the like Trifles, without such loss of their Mariners as in other places: the refore I crost whatsoe∣ver intendments were projected for Virginia or Burmoudos, because they may be hereafter really helpful unto them, as now they serve for Dreyns to unload their Populous State, which else would overthrow his own Banks by continuance of Peace and turn head upon it self, or make a Body fit for any Rebellion: And so far I prevayled therein, as I caused most of the Recusants who were to go thither to withdraw their Ventures and discourage the work: So that besides Private Persons unable to effect much, nothing was done by the Publick Purse: and we know by experience such Voyages and Plantations are not effected with∣out great means, to satisfy great difficulties, and with an unwearied Resolu∣tion and Power to meet all hazards and distastes, with strong help and continu∣al supplies, or else the undertaking proves idle: By this means also I kept the Voluntary Forces from Venice, until it was almost too late to set out, and had hopt that work should have broken forth to action, before these would have ar∣rived to succor them: I put hard for the Cantionarie Towns, which our late Philip of happy Memory so much aimed at, accounting them the Keys of the Low Coun∣tries, That they might be delivered to his Catholick Majesty, as to the proper Owner, and had perhaps prevailed, but that the profest Enemy to our State and Church, who dyed shortly after, gave Counsel to restore them to the re∣bellious States, as one that knew popular Commonwealths to be better Neigh∣bours, safer Friends, and less dangerous than Monarchs, and so by this pra∣ctice wrested from my hands, and furnish'd the Exchequer from thence, for that time, neither was I much grieved, because the dependency they had be∣fore of the English seem'd to be cut off, and the interest that the English had in them to be taken away, which must now fully and finally be effected before we can either hope to conquer them, or England, who holding together, are too strong for the world at Sea; and therefore must be disunited, before they can be overcome. This Point of State is acknowledged by our experienced Pen∣tioner and sure Friend Monsieur Barnvelt; whose suceding Plots to this end shall bear witness for the depth of his Judgement.
But the last Service I did for the State, was not the least; when I under∣wrought that admirable Engine Rawley; and was the cause his Voyage (threat∣ning much danger to us) was overthrown and himself returning in disgrace: I pursued almost to Death, neither (I hope) need I say almost, if all things hit right, and all things hold, but the determination of my Commission would not permit me longer to stay to follow him to Execution, which I desired the rather, that by Confession I might have wrung from the inconsiderable English an ac∣knowledgment of my Masters right in those places, punishing him for attemp∣ting there, though he might prescribe for the first foot; and this I did to stop their mouths hereafter; and because I would quench the Heat and Valour of that Nation, that none should dare hereafter to undertake the like, or be so hardy to look out at Sea, or breath upon our Coast. And lastly, because I would bring to an ignominious Death, that Old Pirate, who is one of the last now living, bred under that deceased English Virago, and by her flesht in our ruine; to do this I had many Agents. First, Diverse Courtiers, who were hungry and gaped wide for Spanish Gold. Secondly, Some that bare him a grudg at the heart for inveterate Quarrels. Thirdly, Some Foreigners, who having in vain sought the Elixir hitherto, ho∣ped to find it in his head. Fourthly, all Men of the Romish Faith, who are of the Spanish Faction; and would have been my Blood-Hounds to hunt him or any such to Death willingly, as Persons hating the Prosperity of their Country; and the Valour, Worth and Wit of their own Nation, in respect of Us and our Catholick Cause. Lastly, I left behind me such an Instrument composed artificially of a Secu∣lar Understanding, and a Religious Profession, as he is every way adopted to screw himself into the Closset of the Heart, and to work upon Feminin lenity, who in that Countrey have Masculine Spirits to command and pur∣sue their Plots unto death, this therefore I count as done, and rejoyce in it, knowing it to be very profitable for us, grateful to our Faction there; and for the rest, what though it be a cross to the People, or that Clergy, we that only Negotiate for our own gain, and treat about this Marriage for our own ends, can conclude or break off when we see our own time, without re∣spect of such as can neither profit us, nor hurt us, for I have certain know∣ledge that the Commons generally are so Effeminate and Cowardly that at their Musters (which are seldom, or sleight, only for the benefit of their Mustermasters) of Thousand Souldiers scarce an Hundred dare discharge a Musket, and of that Hundred scarce one can use it like a Souldier; and for their Armes they are so ill provided that one Corslet serves many men, when such as use their Arms upon a day in one place, lend them to their Friends in other places, to shew them when they have use, and this if it be spied is only punished with a Mulet in the Purse, which is the Officer's aim, who for his advantage winketh at the rest, and is glad to find and cherish by conivance profitable aults, which increase his Revenue, thus stands the State of that poor miserable Country, which had never more People and fewer Men: so that if my Master would resolve upon an Invasion, the time never fits as at this present security of this Marriage, and disuse of Armes having cast them into a deep sleep, a strong and weakning Faction
being ever amongst them ready to assist us, and they being unprovided of Ships and Armes, or Hearts to fight, an universal discontentment filling all men: This have I from their Mustermasters and Captains, who are many of them of our Religion, or of none, and so ours, ready to be bought and sold, and desirous to be my Masters Servants in Fee. Thus much for the State particularly, wherein I have bent my self to weaken them and strengthen us, and in all these have advanced the Catholick Cause, but especially in procu∣ring favours for all such as favour that side, and crossing the other by all means, and this I practiced my self and give out to be generally practised by all others that whatsoever success I find I still boast of Victory, which I do to dishearten the Hereticks, and to make them suspicious one of another, espe∣cially of their Prince, and of their best Statesmen, and to keep our own in courage, who by this means increase, but otherwise would be in danger to decay. Now for Religion, and for such designs as etch their pretence from thence, I beheld the Policy of that late Bishop of theirs (Bancroft) who stood up and maintained dangerous Schisme between our Secular Priests ond Jesuites, by which he discovered much weakness to the dishonour of our Clergy, and prejudice to our Cause, this taught me as it did (Barnevelt) in the Low Countries, to work secretly and insensibly between the Conformist and Noncon∣formist, and to cast an eye as far as the Orcades, knowing that business might be stirred up there that might hinder proceedings in England, and so to prevent their Conquest. The effect you have partly seen in the Earl of Argyle, who sometime was Captain for the King and Church against the Marquess Hunt∣ley, and now fights under our Banner at Bruxels, leaving the Crosses of St. George and St. Andrew for the Staff of St. James. Neither do our hopes end here, for we daily expect more Revolters, at least such a disunion as will never admit solid Reconcilement, but will send some to us, and some to Amsterdam, for the King, a wise and vigilant Prince, labouring for a perfect union betwixt both the Kingdoms, which he seeth cannot be effected where the least Ceremony of Religion is continued, divers sharp and bitter brawls from thence arising, whilest some striving for Honour more than for Truth, prefers their own way, and will, before the general peace of the Church, and the Edification of Souls; He, I say, seeks to work an uni∣formity betwixt both Churches, and to this end made a Journey into Scot∣land, but with no such success as he expected, for divers of ours attended the Train and stirred up Humours and Factions, and cast in scruples and doubts to hinder and cross the proceeding; yea those that seem most averse to us, and averse to our Opinions by their Disobedience and Example, helped for∣ward our Plots, and these are encouraged by a Faction and heady multitude, by a false and irresolute Clergy (many false Brethren being amongst the Bishops) and by the prodigal Nobility who maintain these stirrs in the Church, that thereby they may keep the Church-livings in their hands, which they have most Sacrelegiously seized upon in the time of the first Deformation, and which they fear would be returned by the Clergy, if they could be brought to Peace and agreement, for if they have seen the King very bountiful in this kind, having lately increased their Pensions, and settled the Clergy a competent mainte∣nance,
and besides out of his own means which in that Kingdom is none of the greatest, having brought in and restored whole Bishopricks to the Church, which were before in Lay-mens hands, a great part of the Nobilities Estates consisting of Spiritual Lands, which makes them cherish the Puritanical Facti∣on, who will be content to be Trencher-fed, with Scraps, and Crums, and Contributions, and Arbitrary Benevolences from the Lirds, and Lords, and Ladies, and their adherents and followers. But (quoth the Inquisitor-general) now if this Act of the King wherein he is most earnest and constant should so prevail as it should effect a perfect union both in Church and Commonweal. I tell you it would in my Conceipt be a great blow to us, if by a general meeting a General Peace should be concluded, and all their forces bent against Rome, and we see their politick King aimes at this. True (quoth Gundamore) but he takes his mark amiss, howsoever he under∣stands the People and their inclination better than any man, and better knows how to temper their passions and affections, for (besides that he is hindred there in Scotland underhand by some for the reasons before recited, and by other great Ones of ours who are in great places and Authority amongst them) he is likewise deluded in this point by his own Clergy at home in England, who pretend to be most forward in the cause for they considering if a general Uniformity were wrought, what an Inundation would follow, whilst all or most of theirs (as they fear) would flock hither for preferment (as men pressing to the Sun for Light and heat, and so their own should be unprovided, these therefore (I say) howsoever they bear the King in hand, or underhand against it, and stand for all Ceremonies to be obtruded with a kind of absolute neces∣sity upon them, when the other will not be almost drawn to receive any, when if an abatement were made, doubtless they might be drawn to insert in the midst, but there is no hopes of this with them, where neither Part deals seri∣ously, but only for the present to satisfy the King and so there is no fear on our side, that affections and opinions so diverse will ever be reconciled and made one: The B. of St. Andrews stands almost alone in the cause, and pulls upon him∣self, the labour, the loss, and the envy of all with little proficiency, whilst the adverse Faction have as sure Friends and as good Intelligence about the King as he hath, and the same Post, that perhaps brings a Packet from the King to him brings another from their Abettors to them, acquainting them with the whole Proceedings and Counsels, and preparing them aforehand for opposition, this I know for Truth, and this I rejoyce in, as concerning much the Catholick Good. But (quoth the Nuntio are there none of the Heretical Preachers busie about this match, methinks their fingers should itch to be writing, and their Tongues burn to be Prating of this business, especially the Puritanical Sort, howsoever the most temperate and indifferent carry themselves. The truth is my Lord (quoth the Embassador) that privately what they can, and publickly what they dare, both in England and Scotland all for the most part (except such as are of our Faith) oppose this match to the utmost by Prayers, Counsels, Speeches and wishes, but if one be found longer tongued then his Fellows, we have still means to charm their sausiness, to silence them, and expell them the Court, to disgrace them, and cross their Preferment with the Imputation of pragmatick Puritanism, for instance I will relate this one particular, a Doctor of theirs, and a Chaplain in Ordinary to the King, gave many reasons in a Letter against this Marriage, and propounded a way, how to supply the Kings wants otherways, which I un∣derstanding, so wrought undernd, That the Doctor was committed, and hard∣ly escaped the danger of his presumptuous Admonition, though the State knew
his Intent honest, and his Reasons good, wherein we on the other side (both here and with the Arch-Duke) have Books penned, and Pictures printed directly against their King and State, for the which their Embassadors have sought satis∣faction of us in vain, not being able to stay the Print, or so much as to touch the Hem of the Authors Garment: But we have an Evasion, which Heretioks miss, our Clergy being freed from the Temporal Sword, and so not included in our Treaties and Conditions of Peace, but at liberty to give any Heretical Prince the slip when they list, whereas theirs are lyable to accompt and hazard, and are mussed for barking, when ours may both bark and bite too; the Coun∣sel-Table and the Star-Chamber do so terrifie them, as they dare not riot, but run at the Stirrop with excellent Command, and come in at the least rebuke: They call their preaching in many Places standing up, but they crouch and dare not stand up, behaving themselves like Sitters silent, creeping upon their Bellies lick the Dust, which our Priests shake from their beautiful feet. Now (quoth the Duke of Lerma) satisfy me about our own Clergy, how they fare, for there were here Petitions made to the King in the name of the distressed, afflicted, persecuted and imprisoned Priests, that his Majesty would interceed for them, to free them from the intollerable burdens they groaned under, and to procure them their Liberties, and Letters were directed from us to that end, that you would negotiate that Demand with all speed and diligence. Most excellent Prince (replyed Gondamore) I did your Command with a kind of Command my self, not thinking it fit to make it a Suit in your Name, or my Masters, I obtained them Liberty to walk freely up and down, to face and out∣face their Accusers, judge Magistrates, Bishops, and to excuse their Function almost as freely, altogetheras safely as at Rome. Here the Nuntio replyed, that he did not well in his Judgment, in procuring their Liberty, since they might do more good in prison than abroad, because in prison they seemed to be under persecution, and so were pitied of others, and pity of the person prepares the affection further, besides then they were careful over their own Lives to give none Offence, but abroad they might be scandalous in their Lives, as they use to be in Rome and Spain and other Catholick Countries, and so the opinion of their Holiness, which upholds their credit and cause a∣gainst the married Clergy, would soon decay. But the Embassador answered, he considered those Inconveniences, but besides a superiour Advantage arose from the profit of Liberty more than of Restraint, for now they might freely confer and were ever practising, and would doubt∣less produce some work of wonder, and besides by reason of their Authority and means to change places did apply themselves to many persons, whereas in prison they could only deal with such as came to be taught, and were their own before; and this (quoth he) add as a secret, that as before they were maintai∣ned by private Contributions to denounce Catholicks even to access; so much more now shall they be able to gather great Sums to weaken the State, and fur∣nish them for some high attempt, by the example of Cardinal Woolsey, barrel∣ling up Gold for Rome, and this they may easily do, since all Catholicks rob the Heretical Priests, and hold Tithes from them by fraud or force, to give to theirs of their own, to whom it is properly due, and if this be spyed, it is an easy mat∣ter to lay all upon the Hollander, and say, He carryeth the Coyn out of the Land (who are forward indeed in such practises) and so ours shall not only be excused, but a flaw made betwixt them, to weaken their amities, and to get suspition betwixt them of each others Love.
But amongst all these Priests; (quoth the Inquisitor General) did you re∣member, that Old Reverend Father Baldwin, who had a Finger in that admirable attempt made on our behalf against the Parliament House? Such as he de∣serving so rightly, adventuring their Lives so resolutely for the Catholick Cause, must not be neglected, but extraordinarily regarded, thereby, to en∣courage others to the like undertaking. Holy Father (quoth Gondamore) my principal care was of im, whose Life and Liberty when I had with much difficulty obtained of the King; I solemn∣ly went in Person attended with my Trayn, and diverse other well-willers to fetch him out of the Tower, where he was in durance; as soon as I came into his sight, I behaved my self after so lowly and humble a manner, that our Ad∣versaries stood amazed to see the Reverence we gave to our Ghostly Fathers; and this I did to confound them and their contemptous Clergy, to beget an ex∣traordinary Opinion of Holiness in the Person, and Piety in us; and also to provoke the English Catholicks to the like devout Obedience, that thereby at any time their Jesuites (whose Authority was somewhat weakened, since the Schism betwixt them and the Seculars, and the succeeding POUDER PLOT) may work them to our ends, as Masters their Servants, Tutors their Scholars, Fa∣thers their Children, Kings their Subjects; and that they may do this the more boldly and securely▪ I have somewhat dasht the Authority of their High Commission; upon which whereas there are diverse Pursevants (Men of the worst kind and condition) resembling our Flies and Familiars, attending upon the Inquisition▪ whose Office and Imployment, is to disturb the Catholicks, searching thier Houses for Priests, Holy Vestments, Books, Bedes, Crucifix∣es, and the like religious Appurtenances. I have caused the Execution of their Offices to be slackned, that so an open way may be given to our Spiritual In∣struments, for the free-exercise of their Faculties: And yet when these Pur∣sevants had greatest Authority, a small Bribe in the Country would blind their Eyes, or a little greater at Court, or in the Exchequer frustrate and cross all their Actions, for that their Malice went off like Squibs, made a great Crack to fright Children and new-born Babes, but hurt no Old Men of Catholick Spi∣rits; and this is the effect of all other their Courses of Proceedings in this kind, in all their Judicial Courts, whether known Catholicks committed as they stile them, or often summoned and cited, threatened and bound over, but the danger is past so soon as the Officer hath his Fee paid him, then the Execution goeth no further: nay, upon my conscience they are as glad when there are offenders in that kind, because they are bountiful, and the Officers do their best to favour them, that they may encrease; and so their Reuenue and Gain come in freely. And if they should be sent to Prison, even that place for the most part is made a Sanctuary to them; as the Old Romans were wont to shut up such, by wayes of restraint, as they meant to preserve from the Peoples Fury, for they live safe in Prison, till we have time to work their liberty, and assure their Lives, and in the mean time their place of restraint is as it were a Study to them, where they may have opportunity to confer together as in a Colledge, and to arm themselves in Unity against the Single Adversa∣ry abroad. But (quoth the Inquisitor General) how do they for Books, when they have occasion either to write or to dispute My Lord (replied Gondamore) all the Libraries belonging to the Roman Catho∣licks through the Land, are at their command, from whence they have all
such Collections as they can require gathered to their hands, as well from thence as from all the Libraries of both Ʋniversities, and even the Books themselves if it be requisite; besides, I have made it a principal part of my Imployment, to buy all the Manuscripts and other rare and antient Authors out of the hands of the Hereticks; So that there is no great Scholler dyes in the Land, but my Agents are dealing with his Books, in so much as even their larned Isaac Causa∣bons Library was in election to be ours, had not their Vigilant King (who foreseeth all dangers, and hath his Eye busie in every place) prevented my PLOT; for after the Death of that great Scho∣ler, I sent to request a Catologue of his Books, with the Price, intending not to be outvied by any man, if money would have fetch'd them: Because, beside the damage that side should have received by the less prosecuting the Cause against Cardinal Baronius, we might have made a good advantage of his Notes, Collections Castigasions, Censures and Critcisms for our Party, and framed and put out others under his Name at our pleasure; But this was foreseen by their Pro∣metheus; who sent that Torturer of ours, the B. of Winchester, to search and sort the Papers, and to Seal up the Study, giving a large and a Princelike allowance to the Relict of Causabon; with a bountiful Pention and Provision for Her and Hers; But this PLOT fayling at that time, hath not ever done so; nor had the Ʋniversity of Oxford so triumphed in their many Manuscripts given by that famous Knight Sr Thomas Bodly, if either I had been then imployed, or this course of mine than thought upon; for I would labour what I might this way or any other way to dis∣arm them, or either to translate their best Authors hither, or at least to leave none but in the hands of Roman Catholicks, who are assuredly ours, and to this end a special Eye would be had upon the Library of one Sr. Robert Cotton (an Ingrosser of Antiquities) the most choice and sin∣gular pieces might be gleened, and gathered up by a Catholick Hand: Neither let any Man think That descending thus low to petty Particulars is unworthy an Embassador, or a small avail for the ends we aim at, since we see every Mountain consists of several Sands, and there is no more pro∣fitable conversing for Statesmen, than amongst Schollars, especially the King, for whom we watch is the King of Scholars, and loves to live altogether almost in their Element: Besides if we can by any means continue differences in their Church, or make them wider, or get distast betwixt their Clergy and Common-Lawyers, who are men of greatest power in the Land, the Benefit will be Ours, and the Consequent Great, opening way for us to come between, for personal quar∣rels produce real questions. As he was prosecuting this Discourse one of the Secretaries (who waited without the Chamber) desired Entrance, and being admitted, delivered Letters, which he had newly received from the Post, directed to the President and the rest of the Council from his Catholick Majesty, the Contents whereof were to this Effect. Right trusty and well beloved Cousins and Councellors▪ we greet you well, whereas we had a hope by our Agents in England and Germany to Effect that great Work of the Western Empire, and likewise on the other side to suppress Europe, at one instant, and infoulding it in our Arms, make the easier Road upon the Turks in Asia, and at length reduce all the World to our Catholick Command; and whereas to this end we had secret and sure PLOTS and PROJECTS on foot in all those places, and good Intelligence in all Courts; Know now that we have received late and sad News of the ap∣prehension of our Trusty and able Pentioner Barnevelt, and of the Discovery of other our Intend∣ments, so that our hopes are at present adjourned till some other more convenient and more auspitious time, we therefore will You presently, upon the sight hereof, to break up your Consultations, and Repair straight to Our Presence, there to take further Directions, and proceed as necessity of time and cause shall require. With that his Excellency, and the whole House stook with Amazement, crost their Fore∣heads, rose up in a sad silence, and brake up this Treaty abruptly, and without Tarrianee, took Horse, and posted to COURT, from whence expect News the next fair Wind. In the mean time let not those be secure, whom it concerns to be roused up, knowing that this aspiring Nebuchadnezar will not loose the Glory of his Greatness, who continueth still to magnify himself in his Great Babylon, until it be spoken, The Kingdom is departed from thee, Daniel 4. FINIS.
