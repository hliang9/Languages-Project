A Copy of a Letter from Brian Fairfax Esq; Dated, London July 23. 1696. MY Lord Godolphin this day took notice in Councell of a Passage in one of the Newes Printed papers the last Tuesday July, 21st. Either the Post Boy or flying post or some of them? Wherein he published a Noâˆ£torious Lye, Concerning an Alderman of York, that had Received Six hundred pounds to Distribute amongst the Poor of that City, and keeps the five Hundred pounds to himself. By this (Says my Lord Godolphin) he seems to accuse an honest worthy, Gentleman Alderman Thompson Burges of York; and if he had named him, the Authour of the Scandall, ought to have been prosecuted with the utmost Severity for it's a malitious falsehood, and no ground for it, for there never was any Sume paid to any man upon that Account. This gave my Lord Arch Bishop of Canterbury occasion, to Speak of the Services you have done the Goverment &c. And his Grace bid me acquaint you with this, with his affectionate Service to you. Yours, Br: Fairfax.
