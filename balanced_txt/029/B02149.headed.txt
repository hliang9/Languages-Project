Who was shot to death in the Isle of Man, the 2. of  1 GEntlemen, and the rest of you that have accompanied me this day to the gates of my death, I know you do expect I should say something at my departure; and indeed I am in some measure willing to satisfy you, having not had the least liberty since my imprisonment to acquaint any with the sadness of my sufferings, which flesh and bloud could not have endured, without the power and assistance of my most gracious and good God, into whose hands I do now commit my poor soul, not doubting but that I shall very quickly be in the arms of his mercy. I am, (as now you see) hurried hither by the power of a pretended Court of Justice, the members whereof, or the greatest part of them no ways qualified, but very ill-befitting their now places; the reasons you may give your selves. The cause for which I am brought hither, as the prompted and threatned Jury have delivered is High Treason against the Countess Dowager of Derby, for that I did as they say, in the year fifty one, raise a force against her, for the suppressing and rooting out that fami∣ly: How unjust that accusation is, very few of you that hear me this day but can witness with me, and that the then Rising of the people, in which afterwards I came to be concerned, did not at all or in the least intend the prejudice or ruine of that honourable family; the chief whereof as you well remember being dead eight days, or thereabouts, before that action happened. But the true cause of that ri∣sing, as the Jury did twice bring in, was to present grievances to our honourable Lady, which was done by me, and after approved of by her Ladyship, under the hand of her then Secretary Master Treoach, who is yet living; which agreement hath since to my own ruine and my poor families endless sorrows been fore't from me, the Lord God forgive them the unjustness of their dealings with me, and I wish from my heart it may not be laid to their charge another day. You now see me a sacrifice ready to be offered up for that which was the preservation of your lives and fortunes which then was in hazzard, but that I stood between you and your then (in all appearances) utter ruine. I wish you still may (as you have hitherto) enjoy the sweet benefit and blessing of peace, though from that minute untill now I have still been prosecuted and persecuted, nor have I ever since found a place to rest my self in. But now my God be for ever blessed and praised, that hath given me so large a measure of patience. What services I have done for that honourable Family, by whose power I am now to take my latest breath, I dare appeal to them∣selves whether I have not deserved better things from some of them, then the sentence of my bodily destruction, and seizure of the poor estate, my Son ought to enjoy being purchased and left him by his Grandfather. It might have been much better, had I not spent it in the service of my honourable Lord of Derby and his Family. These things I need not mention to you, for that most of you are witnesses to it, I shall now beg your patience whilst I tell you here in the presence of my God that I never in all my life acted any thing with intention to prejudice my Sovereign Lord the King, nor the late Earl of Derby, nor the now Earl; yet notwithstanding being in England at the time of his Sacred Majesties happy restauration, I went to London with many others to have a sight of my gracious King, whom God preserve, and who untill then I never had seen, but I was not long there when I was arrested upon an action of twen∣ty thousand pounds, and clapt up into the Fleet; unto which Action I being a stranger could give no Bayl, but was there kept near a whole year. How I suffered there, God he knows; but at last having gain'd my libertie, I thought good to advise with several Gen∣tlemen concerning his Majesties gracious Act of Indempnity that was then set forth by his Majestie, in which I thought my self con∣cern'd, unto which they told me there was no doubt to be made but that all actions committed in the Isle of Man, relating in any kind to the War was pardoned by the Act of Indempnity, and all other places within his Majesties Dominions and Countries, whereupon, and having been forct to absent my self from my poor wife and children near three years, being all that time under persecution, I did with great content and satisfaction return into this Island, hoping then to receive the comfort and sweet enjoyment of my friends and poor Family, But alas I have faln into the snare of the Fowler, but my God shall ever be praised, and though he kill me, yet will I trust in him. I may justly say no man in this Island knows better then my self the power my Lord of Derby hath in this Island subordinate to his Sacred Majestie, of which I have given a full account in my Declaration presented to my Judges, which I much fear must never see light, which is no small trouble to me: It was his Majesties gracious Act of Indempnity that gave me the confidence and assurance of my safety, on which, and an Appeal I made to his Sacred Majesty and Privie Council, from the unjustnesse of the proceedings held against me, I did much relie being his Ma∣jesties Subject here, and a Denison of England both by birth and fortune, and in regard I have disobeyed the power of my Lord of Derby's Act of Indempnity, which you now all look upon, and his Majesties gracious Act cast out, as being of no force, I have with greater violence been prosecuted; yet neverthelesse I do declare, That no Subject whatsoever can, or ought to take upon them to make Acts of Indempnity, but his Sacred Majesty only, and confirmation of a Parliament. It is very fit I should say something as to my Education and Religion; I think I need not inform any, all of you knowing that I was brought up as a son of the Church of England, which was at that time in their Splendor and Glory, and to my endlesse comfort I have ever since continued a faithful member; witnesse several of my actions in these late times of Liberty, against Quakers, &c. and as for Go∣vernment, I never was against Monarchy, which is now to my souls great satisfaction, I have lived to see it throughly settled and established, well assuring my self, that men of upright lives and conversations, may have the favourable countenance of our gracious good King, under whose happy Government God of his infinite mercy long continue these His Kingdomes and Dominions; and now I do most heartily thank my good God, that I have had so much liberty and time to disburden my self of some things that hath lain heavy upon me all the time of my imprisonment, in which I have not had time or liberty to speak or write any of my thoughts, and from my soul I wish all animosities may after my death be quite laid aside, and my death by none called in question, for I do freely forgive all that hath had any hand in my persecutions, and may our good God preserve you all in peace and quiet all the remainder of your dayes. Be ye all of you, as you are His Majesties Liege people, most loyal and faithful to His Sacred Majesty; and according to your Oaths of faith and fealty, to my honourable Lord of Derby, do ye likewise in all just and lawfull ways observe his commands, and know that you must one day give an account of all your deeds, and now the blessing of Almighty God be with you all, and preserve you from all vio∣lent death, and keep you in peace of conscience all your days. I will now hasten, for my flesh is willing to be dissolved, and my spirit to be with my God, who hath given me full assurance of his mercy and pardon for all my sins, of which his unspeakable goodnesse and loving kindnesse, my poor soul is exceedingly satisfied: and then he falling upon his knees, and having ended a prayer, in which he shewed much of earnestnesse, he got up exceeding chearfully, and calling for the Soldiers, he said unto them, And now for you that are my executioners by lot, I do here freely forgive you, and in assurance thereof I will kiss you all, and did so, desiring them, and all present to pray for his soul; He said there is now but a thin vaile betwixt me and death; once more I desire your prayers, for now I take my last farewell of you all; after which they intending to bind him to the place where he stood, he told them, you need not trouble yourselves nor me, for I that dare look death in the face in what shape soever he appears, will not start at your Fire, nor Bullets, nor can the power you have, take the least grain of my courage from me; and having white paper given him upon his desire, he took it and pind it himself upon his breast to direct the Soldiers where to aim; and turning aside himself he made a short prayer, after which he said to his executioners, hit this, and you do yours and my work, and presently after stretching forth his armes, which was the sign he gave them, received the shots, and yielded up the Ghost, having not one drop of blood poured out upon the ground, though shot into the heart. Much more would have been said, to the satisfaction of the world, had be got the liberty of Pen, Ink or Paper. The above written is only that which he spoke at the place of execution.
