An Exact CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY AND FULL DISPLAY OF POPES Intollerable Usurpations Upon the antient just Rights, Liberties, of the Kings, Kingdoms, Clergy, Nobility, Commons of ENGLAND and IRELAND. THE design of this Chronological History and Display, being princi∣pally to remonstrate to the world, by irrefragable Testimonies and Records, the manifold unsufferable Ʋsurpations of the Bishops and See of Rome, from time to time, upon the antient indubitable just Rights and Liberties of the Kings, Churches, Nobles, Commons of England and Ireland, whiles they continued under their Foreign Jurisdiction: More especially by Excomunications, Interdicts, absolving Subjects from their Oathes of Allegiace, raising Re∣bellions, dethroning our Kings, enforcing them to resign their Crowns, to become their sworn Vassals, Tributaries; exempting Bishops, Clerks from their Homage, Ju∣dicatures; collating Bishopricks, Monasteries, Ecclesiastical Dignities, Benefices, by Provisions to Aliens, or others; translating, swearing Bishops, Abbots, to them and their Papal See; vacating due Elections at their pleasures; Appeals to Rome, Dispensations, Tenths, Procurations, First-Fruits, Bribes, Symony, Crossadoes; varieties of Extorti∣ons, Oppressions, by their Legates and other Instruments: To discover their originals, progresse, growth, revivals, suppressions, with the manifold memorable Complains, Let∣ters, Oppositions, Writs, Prohibitions, Declarations against them, both in and out of Par∣liament; and the frequent Treacheries, Usurpations, of our Popish Prelates, Spiritual Courts, Officers, upon our Kings just Rights, Prerogatives, Regalities, Courts, Subjects Liberties, (to the extraordinary dger, mischief of the Crown, Realm, Church, Chri∣stian Religion, and peoples grievance.) And what Soveraign Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction our Kings, as Gods Vicars, have exercised, from King Lucius his Conversion, Anno 183. till the total extirpation of the Popes usurped Authority, by King Henry the 8. and Edward the 6. by Histories, and memorable Records in the Tower and Rolls, for the most part unknown to our greatest Clerks, Antiquaries, worthy publick view; yea adding much light to our Ecclesiastical and Political Histories, (very defective in these Transactions of grand Importance:) I apprehended it absolutely necessary, by way of Introduction (like aMat. 7. 24, 25. Luke 8. 4. Wise Builder) to lay a deep, sure Foundation, whereon to bottom this Weighty Structure, that so if any Floods shall hereafter come, or Windes blow, and beat upon it from Rome, or other Quarters, they may not be able to shake, or over∣turn it, because it is founded upon a Rock.
To this end I shall (by Gods assistance) in one intire Book, Chronologically and Historically remonstrate, and (where necessity requires) Polemically examine, dis∣cusse the Original of Soveraign Jurisdiction; in what Persons God himself hath setled the Primitive Right and Exercise thereof, as well over the Churches Militant as Civil State, from Adams Creation till Christs Ascension, and from thence till this present age: And irrefragably demonstrate, by Scripture, Heathen Philosophers, Fathers, Councils, Ecclesiastical Histories, Imperial Laws, Edicts, Popes own Epistles, Decretals, Bulls, Archbishops, Bishops, Popish Divines, School-men, Canonists, Protestant Writers, Testimonies, and Presidents, in all ages, That the Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, (in governing, protecting, reforming the Church, and people of God; maintaining, propagating the Orthodox Christian Faith, the true publike worship of God; suppressing all Heresies, Errors, Blasphemies, Idolatries, Schisms, sinnes, against both Tables, in all Persons, as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal; taking care of the souls, and salvation of men) is origi∣nally vested by God himself, in Kings, Emperors, or Soveraign Princes, as Gods Vicege∣rents, and Christs Vicars upon Earth, as the principal part of their Royal Authority, Office, Trust; not in High-Priests, Priests, Apostles, Popes, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, or any other Ecclesiastical persons whatsoever; who are all Subjects to, and subordinate Ministers under them, in the Churches Militant, within their respective Empires, Kingdoms, Dominions, as all inferiour Civil Magistrates, Officers of Justice, are in their Civil States, Kingdoms, Courts: And that the received Distinction ofGratian Di∣stinct 10, 96. & caus. 2 qu. 7 Here p. 120, 121.

Quid principale, nisi quod super omnia, nisi quod ante omnia, & in quo omnia? Haec Deus solus habendo est, & solus habendo, Deus est. Si & alius habuerit, tot jam erunt Dii, quot habuerint quae Dei sunt. Quod summum sit, Deus est: summum autem non erit, nisi quod unicum fuerit. Unicum autem esse non poterit, cui aliquid adaequabitur. Veritas autem sic unum Deum exigit defendendo, ut solius sit quicquid ipsius est. Ita enim ipsius erit, si fuerit solius: Et ex hoc alius Deus non possit admitti, dum nemini licet habere de Deo ali∣quid. Ergo, inquis, nec nos habemus Dei aliquid. Imo, habemus, & habebimus; sed ab ipso, non à nobis. Nam & Dii erimus, si & meruerimus illi esse de quibus praedicavit, Ego dixi, vos Dii estis: & stetit Deus in Ecclesia Deorum: sed ex gratia ipsius, non ex nostra proprietate, quia ipse est solus, qui Deos faciat. I may most aptly apply it to Emperors, Kings, who are Earthly Gods, made such by God in their own Kingdoms, as his Vice-roys. The Soveraign Power, Jurisdiction, over all persons, Churches, causes, as well Civil as Ecclesiastical, within their respective Realms, must be but one inire indivisible Soveraign Authority, incommunicable unto any other subject or person whatsoever, but by subordinate derivation and delegation by, from, or under them; else they should presently cease to be Earthly Gods, had Popes or Bishops a di∣stinct Supreme Ecclesiastical Power within their Realms, coequal with, underived from, or independent on them. WhenceDe Quaestio∣nibus Novi & Veteris Testa∣menti, qu. 210. St. Augustine thus resolves: Sicut terreni Imperatoris auctoritas currit per omnes, ut in omnibus ejus sit reverentia. Ita Deus instituit, ut ab ipso Rege Dei auctoritas incipint, et currat per cunctos. Quamvis frequenter mundus hoc non intelligit, & alii se subjiciat in potestate positus
quam debet, tamen institutio est, ut unus sit qui timeatur. Ubi ergo haec insti∣tutio non est, ibi Cathedra pestilentiae reperitur: (as it is at Rome.) Nusquam enim unius Dei auctoritas abjicitur, nisi apud eos qui multorum Deorum praedicant metum. From hence ourDoctrinalio Fidei, Tom. 1. Artic. 3. c. 78. sect. 3. f 391. Thomas Waldensis thus concludes: Ecce ab ipso Rege inci∣pit auctoritas, & currit per cunctos executores justitiae; & hoc instituit Deus: non ergo in∣stituit Deus, ut inciperet à Summo Sacerdote, & sola executio potestatis manaret in Prin∣cipem. See Tertullian Apolog. c. 30, 31. Here p. 52. Ecce, inde est Imperator, unde & homo antequam Imperator: & unde homo antequam Imperator, nisi à Deo? Quamvis a Deo per Sacerdote Christianus homo, ta∣men nec homo, nec Christianus homo, nisi a Deo; Ita nec Imperator, nec Christi∣anus Imperator, nisi a Deo, quamvis per Pontificem fidelis sit Imperator a Christo; et inde potestas illi, unde et spiritus; et nunquid spiritus illi a Pon∣tifice? Tertullianus intendi, Quod non, sed a Deo profecto: ergo non potestas illi a Sacerdotio provenit, a cujus dono animam non accepit. Potestatis Regiae primum initium in ipso Rege a Deo, et ab ipsius auctoritate manat in subditas potestates; as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, as I shall here demonstrate, against all Papal or Pontifical pretences to the contrary. For methods sake I shall digest the sum of my First Book into these 5. Propositions. 1. That from Adams creation, till the Law given by God to Moses, (and by him unto the Israelites, his peculiar people) the Supreme Paternal, Regal, Magistratical, with that now stiled Spiritual, Pontifical, Ecclesiastical Authority or Jurisdiction, both in and over the Family, State, Church Militant, was by Divine and Natural Right vested, united in one person, not many; to wit, First in Adam himself, but after his decease in the First-born, (unlesse disinherited by God for sin) or in the Patriarch, or Master of the Family, Tribe, who was both King and Priest, having the Priest∣hood annexed to his Paternal or Regal Office, not these to his Priestship. 2ly. That God, after the Israelites deliverance from the Aegyptian bondage, when he first new-modelled them into a Commonwealth, (and afterwards into a Kingdom) set∣led both their State and Church-government, dividing the Priesthood from the Supreme Civil Magistracy, Kingship, vesting the one in Moses, Josuah, David, Solomon, and their Royal Successors; the other in Aaron, his Sons, and Tribe of Levi; left the Soveraign Ecclesiastical Power, Jurisdiction over all persons, causes, still annexed to the Kingly or Supreme Magistratical Office, and residing in the King, or chief Civil Officer as before, transferring to Priests only the Ministerial Priestly Offices, not the Soveraign Spiritual Jurisdiction, the same in kind with, a real part of, and various dis∣pensation only from the Civil Supremacy. 3ly. That the Supreme Government of the Church Militant, after Christs Incarna∣tion, under the Gospel, was vested in Jesus Christ himself, God and Man, only as he is the King, not Priest or Prophet of the Church, his Priestly and Prophetical Offices being united to his Kingly, as the first, highest in dignity and order, not his Regal to his Pontifical or Prophetical Offices. 4ly. That Jesus Christ as Supreme King, Lord, Head of his Kingdom the Church, whilst on Earth, never claimed, nor exercised any Temporal Regal Jurisdiction, or Magistratical Authority over any of his Subjects, much less over Emperors, Kings, Kingdoms, Nations, or Soveraign Civil Powers, nor ever deprived any of them of their Crowns, nor absolved their Subjects from their Allegiance, nor cast down, pulled, or rooted up their Kingdoms, nor gave them to whomsoever he pleased: Neither did he either before, at, or after his Passion, Resurrection, or Ascension, derive any such Superlative Power to St. Peter, as his sole universal Vicar or Viceroy, nor to any other Apostle, Bishop, Priest, or Pope whatsoever: Nor yet delegate to them his supreme Spiritual Jurisdiction over his Kingdom in this world, the Church Militant, and all the Members of it: but only the Ministerial part of his Prophetical Office, (his Heb. 7. 15. to the end. c. 8. 1. c. 9. 11, 12, 24, 25, 26, 28. c. 10. 11, to 24. High Priesthood being personal, untransferrable, incommunicable to any other) to wit, preaching the Gospel publickly to all Nations, administring the Sa∣craments of Baptism and the Lords Supper, according to his Institution and Com∣mand, feeding his sheep with the sincere milk of his Word, teaching them (as his Apostles, Ministers, Servants) to obey whatsoever he hath commanded them; beseeching, intreating them as his Ambassadors, in his stead, to be reconciled unto God: to declare, pronounce them absolved from their sins by God himself, upon their sincere Repentance, and to denounce damnation against them in case they do not re∣pent and believe in Christ.
5ly. That Gods principal end and intention in ordaining Kings and supreme Civil Magistrates in the world, was not the bare external administration of Justice between man and man, the protection of their Subjects from violence, oppression; the preser∣vation of them in worldly peace, plenty, prosperity; the punishment of Malefactors, the rewarding of Well-doers, encouragement of Arts, Vertue, Trade, Industry, or fight∣ing their Battels in times of War against Invading Enemies; thoughHere, p. 191, 192, 193. considerable parts of their Regal Office, and Soveraign Authority: But the advancement of Gods honour, worship, service, glory, and spiritual Kingdom, whose Viceroys they are; the suppression of all Idolatry, Blasphemy, Heresie, schisme, sin, wickednesse; the promotion of the eternal salvation, felicity of their people, and to be2 Chron. 9. 8. Kings for the Lord their God, by advancing his interest all they can. Upon which ground (in order to effect these ends) God himself, as well under the Gospel as Law, hath delegated the supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction only to Kings, and other Soveraign Temporal Potentates, not to Popes, Bishops, Priests, who are subordinate to them as their Subjects, Ministers, not Copartners with them in their Soveraign Ecclesiastical Authority in point of Inte∣rest, nor yet in its actual execution, no further then they are pleased by their Laws or Commissions to delegate it to them, as their Substitutes. When I have Chronologically evidenced, and fully demonstrated the truth of these five Conclusions in so many distinct Chapters, in this First Book, I shall then wholly addresse my self to my intended Chronological History, in relation to the Kings and Crown of England, from Lucius our first Christian King, Anno Dom. 183. till the Popes extirpation, concluding my First Tome thereof, with the reign of King Henry the third, Anno 1273. THE FIRST BOOK. CHAP. I. Proposition 1. That from Adams Creation, till the Law given by God to Moses, and by him unto the Israelites, (his peculiar people) the Supreme Paternal, Regal, Magistratical, together with that now stiled Spiritual, Pontifical, Ecclesiastical Authority or Juris∣diction, both in and over the Family, State, Church Militant, was by Divine and Natural Right vested, united in one person, not di∣vers; to wit, First in Adam himself, but after his decease in the First-born, (unlesse disinherited by God for some crime or cause) or in the Patriarch, or Master of the Family, Tribe, who was both King and Priest, having the Priesthood annexed to his Paternal or Regal Office, not these to his Priestship. O evidence the truth of this Proposition, so far as the light of Scripture or Nature in the first remote obscure age of the world have revealed it, for the Readers satisfaction, I find it generally acknowledged by all or most See Bishop Carlton of Ju∣risdiction Re∣gal, Episcopal, Papal, ch. 2.

Others, who were both Kings and Priests, and the High Priests alwayes inferiour, subordinate to the Chief Civil Governors and Kings of Judah, and in Heathen Nations. It thence most clearly follows, that the Priest∣hood and Spiritual Jurisdiction in Adam was at first united and subordinate to his Kingly, Soveraign Magistratical Office and Authority, and so continued whiles re∣siding in one person; from the Creation till the Law given in mount Sini. 2ly. That Cain, Adams first-born, having forfeited his birthright and life too by the murther of his Brother Abel, and therebyGen. 4. 11. 14. Seth becomming his first-born, when Adam deceased, his Kingship and Priesthood descended first to Seth, and after him successively to the Patriarchs, who were not only theBoudoc, Ordo Ecclesiae a mundi princi∣pio usque ad Mosen, l. 1 c. 17 Salianus Anna∣les Eccles.

Upon this account, after the Law given and Priesthood vested in Aaron and the Tribe of Levi, theExod. 13. 13. c. 22. 29. c. 34. 20. Numb. 3. 12, 13. 42, to 51. c. 8. 16, 17, 18. firstborn (though they lost this priviledge of exercising the Priests Office as before, yet they were still the Lords) to redeem themselves with an oblation of five shekels by the poll, for their exemption from the Priesthood; because God had taken the Levites from among the Israelites, instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, which redemption was given to Aaron and his Sonnes, who officiated in their steads. 4ly. That upon this original right, priviledge of Primogeniture, Christ himself asPs. 89. 27. Gods firstborn, was not only made Higher then the Kings of the Earth,1 Tim. 6. 15. Rev. 17. 14. c. 19. 16. King of Kings, Lord of Lords; but likewiseCol. 1. 15. to 20. Head over all the Church, that in all things he might have the Preeminence. And had (like the First-born before the Law) the Supream Priestly Office and Power, united to his Kingly; Yea in some sence Christ hath fully restored this antient Right to all who are spiritually GodsHeb. 12. 23 First-born, and theRom. 16. 7.

That the very Gentiles and Pagan Nations by the Law and Light of Nature, vested the Supream Ecclesiastical Authority, and oft times the Priesthood it self in their Kings, and chief Temporal Magistrates, who erected, consecrated Temples, Altars, Groves, constituted by their particular Lawes the several Orders, Offices of Priests; the Number, Worship, Services of their Gods, and the Sacrifices, Ceremo∣nies and whole manner of their Worship. To instance in some particulars. Godwins Roman Antiq. l. 2. Sect 1. &c. 9. &  Mo∣ses & , l. 1. c. 4. Fanus the antientest of the Kings in Italy, was the first who brought in thi∣ther the form of Religion; He cousecrated Groves, erected Temples, from whom they were called Fana; ordained Priests and Sacrifices. Evander his next Successor, intro∣duced many other Ceremonies in the Worship of the Gods. Anius, as l. 3.  Ro∣man Antq. l. 2. c. 9. Virgil re∣lates, was at once, REX IDEM HOMINUM, PHAEBIQUE SACERDOS. After Rome was built, Romulus the first King thereof, and Numa Pompilius who succeeded him, made several Lawes concerning the whole Worship, Service, Holy-dayes, Cere∣monies of their Gods, instituted their distinct Orders of Priests; as highest Priest, chief Priests, and lesser Priests, Vestals, Salii; distinguishing and limiting all their respective Offices, Jurisdictions, habits, by special Laws, recorded byAntiq. Rom l. 3. Sect. 3, 8, Dionysius Halicarnasseus, In Romu∣s, & Nama. Plutarch,Rom. Hist. l. 12. Livy, andPaulus Manu∣tus Anttiq. l. 1. others: YeaRom. Ant. l. 2. c. 9. Godwin observes, That it was A CUS∣TOME among the Graecians, as likewise afterwards among the Romans, THAT THEIR KINGS SHOULD PERFORM AS WELL THE CEREMONIES AND HOLY RITES OF RELIGION, as Civil businesses, being BOTH KINGS AND PRIESTS, tillSee Dionys. Han. Ant. Rom. l. 2. & Plutarchi Nu∣ma. Numa perceiving that foreign wars did often occasion the Kings ab∣sence, whereby the service of the Gods was neglected, thereupon ordained several Orders of Priests, (as their Vicars generals or Curates) to discharge their priestly function: Yet af∣ter this institution their Consuls, Censors, and some of their Pagan Emperors, asCor. Tacit. Annal. l. 3. p. , De∣fence of the A∣pol. pat 6. c. 11. dvis. 4, 5. p. 711. Ti∣berius, Veatian, Trajan, were created PONTIFEX MAXIMUS, their Highest Priest, (or POPE) and managed the Supream Civil and Pontifical affairs, and that by election of the Senate, and the people only, without the Priests; asGen. dierum l. 2. c. 8. Alexander ab Alexandro, and the Roman Histories record. I shall close this Chapter with that of the Roman Histori∣an, Jstinus toriae, lib. 1. PRINCIPIO RERUM GENTIUM{que} IMPERIUM PENES REGES ERAT, populus nullis legibus tenebatur, arbitria Principum pro legibus erant; and that as well in all Sacred, Religious, as Civil and Military affairs. BOOK I. CHAP. II. 2. My Second Proposition is, That God, after the Israelites delive∣rance from the Egyptian bondage, when he first new modelled them into a Commonwealth, and afterwards into a Kingdom; setled their State and Church government, and divided the Priesthood from the Supream Civil Magistracy and Kingship, vesting the one in Moses, Josuah, David, Solomon, and their Royal Successors, the o∣ther in Aaron, his Sons, and the Tribe of Levi, did even then leave the Soveraign Ecclesiastical Power and Jurisdiction over all per∣sons and causes, still annexed to, and residing in the Supream Civil Magistratical Office and Officers, transferring only the Ministerial Priestly Offices to the Priests, not the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction. being not different in kind from, but the very same with the Civil, varyed only by the Object, not Subject of it. THis I shall evidence as clear as the noon-day Sunne. 1. By Ten memorable particulars recorded in Sacred History, concerning
Moses, (the first Supream Temporal Governor in the Israelites Commonwealth,) de∣monstrating his Soveraign Jurisdiction in all Sacred, Religious, Church affairs. 1. God himself by the Ministry ofExod. 13 Moses (not Aaron) instituted, described, celebrated the feast and Sacrament of the Passeover, and sanctified all the firstborn of the children of Israel unto God, and was to Aaron INSTEAD OF GOD, Exod. 4. 16. 2ly.Exod. 15.  &c. Rev. 15. 3 Moses, not Aaron, penned and prescribed that memorable Song of Praise which all the Israelites sang unto the Lord, immediately after their deliverance out of E∣gypt, and drowning of the Egyptians n the Red Sea. 3dly.Exod. 16. John 6. 31, 3 33, &c. 1 Cor 10. 3. Moses, not Aaron, gave them instructions concerning the gathering, and for reserving of an Omer of Manna to be kept before the Lord, as a Type of Christ, the true Manna. 4ly. God himself immediatelyExod. c. 19. to 21. 24. Mat. 4. & 5. John 1. 17. c. 7. 19. Josh. 8. 31. 35. appeared unto Moses in Mount Sinai, and by his Mouth and Ministry alone (not Aarons) delivered the first Covenant, and the Moral, Ceremonial and Iudicial Law unto his people Israel, the only rule of their Worship, Obedience, Government Sacred and Civil. 5ly. That whenExod. c. 14. to 21. c. 31. 18. c. 12. 15, 16. Deut. c. 4. & 5. c. 9, 10. Heb. 9. 19. Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and seventy of the Elders were af∣terwards called up into Mount Sinai by God; Moses alone was called to come near to God, and Aaron left behind; That Moses alone wrote all the words of the Lord, built an Altar for the 12 Tribes of Israel, read the Book of the Covenant to them, sprinkled the blood of the Covenant both on the Altar, Book, & all the people; received the Tables of stone and Law written therein by God himself; and the pattern of the Tabernacle, Mercy-seat, Altar, and all the furniture and utensils thereof, the garments of Aaron and the Priests, the manner and ceremonies of their respective Consecrations, and all the oblations, sacrifices, and parts of Gods worship to be therein performed both by the Priests and people, from God. Hence it is specially recorded both in the Old Testament and New, That these precepts concerning the Sanctuary of God,Exod. 25. 3. 40. Numb. 8. 4. Hebr. 8. 5. Acts 7. 44. Let them make me a Sanctua∣ry that I may dwell amongst them, according to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the Tabernacle, and the pattern of the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it: AndExod. 31, to cap. 40. look that thou make them after the pattern which was shewed thee in the Mount; were given only to Moses, the Chief Temporal Magistrate; (Not to Aaron nor the Priests or Levites;) who alone directed all things to be made accordingly. And when all the work of the Tabernacle with the Curtains and the Priests Garments were finished by the Workmen,Exod. 39, 42, 43. Moses, not Aaron, survayed and looked upon all the work, and behold they had done it as the Lord commanded, even so had they done it, and Moses (not Aaron) blessed them. 6ly. After all the work was thus finished,Exod. 40. 1. to 36. Moses, not Aaron, was particularly commanded to rear up the Tabernacle, with all its furniture, and to anoint and consecrate them unto God. 7ly. Which is most observable, Aaron and his Sonnes did not anoint Moses to be the Supream Civil Magistrate; but on the contrary, God by Moses not only prescri∣bed all the spiritual Offices, duties, qualifications, vestments,Levit. 21. 7, &c. wives, marriages, main∣tenance, and appurtenances belonging to Aaron and his sons, but also specially design∣ed and commanded Moses, to anoint and consecrate them to their Priesthood, re∣corded in these words, Exod. 40. 12, to 17. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, THOƲ shalt bring Aaron and his sonnes to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregati∣on, and wash them with water; and THOU shalt put upon Aaron the holy Garments, and anoint him, and sanctifie him, that he may Minister unto me in the Priests Office: And Thou shalt bring his Sonnes and cloath them with coats, and Thou shalt anoint them, as Thou didst their Father, that they may Minister unto me in the Priests Office: For their anointing shall surely be an everlasting Priesthood throughout their generations: Thus did Moses according to all that the Lord commanded him, so did he. So Moses finished the Work, without Aarons, or his Sonnes assistance. Never did Aaron nor his Sons consecrate or anoint any part of the Taber∣nacle, Ark, or utensils thereof, their own garments, oyntment, nor any one High Priest or Levite of their Tribe, butSee Num: 20: 25: to 29.

persons or things, to themselves alone by a pretended Divine right, excluding the Civil Magistrate) seriously to consider, and from thenceAventinus An∣nal: Boiar: l. 6: p: 506: Avaus  De Panctu Eccles: l. 1: art: 13: argue a superiority over Kings, Emperors as well as Priests, and exact Canonical obedience from them. 8ly. WhenExod. 32. throughout, Ps. 106. 19, 20. 1 Cor. 10. 7. Acts 7. 40. Aaron the High Priest during Moses his absence in the Mount, had at the peoples request, made, erected a golden calf, who committed idolatry with it; Moses calls him to a strict account for it, to whom he made an excuse, with this memorable preface, Let not the anger of MY LORD wax hot; which stile he likewise gave him Nu. 12 11.) Yea Moses, not he, Pronounced the Judgment and punishment upon the peo∣ple for this Sin of Idolatry, as likewiseNum. 15. 32, to 37. on him that gathered sticks on the Sabbath day, the manner of whose punishment he inquired (not Aaron) and received from God. 9ly. When the Tables of stone formerly broken were renewed, redelivered by God to the people, it was alwayes done (even after Aarons consecration) by the hand, mouth, ministry ofSee the whole Booke of Deut. especially c. 4, & 5. & cap. 31. to 34 osnua 1. 17. c. 8. 31. 33. Moses, who with his own mouth alwayes spake and delivered Gods Laws, Messages to all the Congregation, Elders, people, during all his Government, and gave them a special charge of things future, and a blessing at his death. 10thly. God made choice of Moses (a Lay-man and Civil Magistrate) to be the fir pman and Register of all his sacred Laws, and first Five Books of holy Scripture, not Aaron, or any other Priest; And to shew that Kings and Temporal Magistrates were the principal keepers of both Tables, God particularly enjoyned when the Is∣raelites came into the Land of Canaan, and had set a King over them,Deut. 17. 15, 17, 18, 19, 20. that the King when he sate upon the Throne of his Kingdom, shall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book out of that which is before the Priests the Levites; that it may be well with him; and he shall read therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and to keep all the words of this Law, and these Statutes to o them▪ That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren; and that he turn not aside from the Commandement, to the right hand or to the left, to the end that he may prolong his dayes in his kingdom, he and his children in the midst of Israel. All which particulars laid together, relating to and acted by the very first Supream Civil Magistrat that God himself set up over his own peculiar people, Church, when he first instituted, modelled both their Magistrates and Priests, with their distinct Offices and powers, will infallibly clear the Superiour Jurisdiction of the Supream Civil Magistrate in and over all Ecclesiastical persons and causes, by Gods own institution▪ and that the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction is united to the Temporal. The reason why God reserved the Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction to Moses, the Chief Civil Magistrate, and afterwards to Kings, when he transferred the Priest∣hood to Aaron and his Sons, and severed it from the Kingship, was, because it would be inconsistent with Monarchie, and the Peace, Unitie of the Republike, Kingdom, Church, to erect two distinct Supream Powers independent on, unsubordinate to each other in one and the same Body Politick, Nation, Kingdom united under one Supream Civil Head, and a Cause of perpetual Wars, Schismes, Contentions between these different powers, by reason of mens Natural ambition, and desire to enlarge their Juriisdictions to the prejudice of each other. This we find experimentally ve∣rified in the Israelites themselves immediatly upon their division into two indepen∣dent kings, kingdoms, of equal power unsubordinate to each other, which produced not only perpetual Warres between them all their dayes in their Realms, as sacred Story 1 Kings 14. 30. c. 15. 9, 7. 16. 31. oft records, but a more sad division in their Religion, Worship, Church;1 Kings 12. 26. to the end. c. 1. 33, 34. c. 15. 3. 2 Kigs 10. 31. cap. 17. 2. to 25. Jeroboam erecting two Calves and a new idolatrous worship, with suitable Priests, to promote it, and a new place of worship contrary to that prescribed by God himself, to keep his Subjects from Gods true worship at Jerusalem, and returning to their allegiance and obedience to their rightfull Kings of the seed of David; which all his Successors persevered in till their final captivity and utter desolation for their idolatry. And it is infallibly evidenced by the manifold sad Divisions, Schismes, Wars, Rebellions in most Christian Empires, king∣doms, ever since the ambitious Popes of Rome and other Prelates, have claimed by a pretended divine independent right, and usurped to themselves the Supream Ecclesi∣astical Jurisdiction over all Persons, Causes, inseparably united by God himself to the Crowns of Christian Emperonrs and Kings. As God therefore out of his infinit Wisdom, at the very Creation, constituted but one natural head over every natural body of Men, Beasts, Fowls, Fishes, and creeping living creatures, though they consisted of two different substances, Soul and Body, not two distinct heads, the one corporal, the other spiritual, to govern each body; because two Supream head
would have destroyed the unity, harmony, operations of these Creatures in their respective orbes; and made1 Cor. 12, 13. to 26. a Schisme in their bodies; So he at first united the Supream Spiritual and Temporal Jurisdiction over Men at the Creation in one person, Adam, the first sole Monarch of the World; And afterwards, when his Church and people multiplyed into such a vast dispersed multitude, that one per∣son could not possibly execute or discharge the Kingly and Priestly Offices (as at first he conveniently might, did whiles all united in one Tribe and Family) so that there was an absolute necessity to divide them into several Hands, Tribes; God did even then reserve the Supream Ecclesiastical Government and Jurisdiction, as absolutely necessary for, inseparable from the Supream Civil Head and Governor of his people, to prevent Schismes, Confusions, and preserve Unity, Tranquillity both in Church and State; not transferr it from Moses to Aaron; the Church with all its Officers, Members, being included in & branches of the Kingdom, Republike, not divided from it as a distinct independent spiritual corporation: Therefore still to remain under the sole Government and protection of the Supream Politick Head.Ezech. 37. 26. to 28. This is most clearly and significantly expressed by Ezechiels uniting the two divided sticks into one rod in one hand, typifying the uniting of the two divided Kingdomes of Israel and Iudah, into one Kingdom, Church, PEOPLE, under one King and Shepheard Jesus Christ, and making them all but ONE, in their Government and true Worship of God accor∣ding to his Statutes. Hence it is most apparent, that the Civil and Ecclesiastical Powers, Authorities or Jurisdictions are not thus denominated, because they are vested in different persons hands, or flow from various fountains, or distinct in their natures, (as theGratian Distinct. 96. & qu. 63. Pon∣tificians and others generally assert, and mistake) but meerly because they are exer∣cised upon or about different things or objects; the persons wherein they originally and supreamly reside and from whence they flow, and the very Powers, Authorities, Jurisdictions themselves in their nature, being but one and the same, only the objects, matters, in, upon, or about which they are exercised, various and distinct, from whence they have these different Epithites. To evidence this truth past all contradiction, being the surest Oracle to resolve all future Controversies concerning these Juris∣dictions, yea keenest axe to cut off that ambitious usurping Antichristian Power of Roman Pontifs, which2 Thes. 2. 4. opposeth, exalteth it self above all that is called God, and tram∣pleth under feet both the Crowns, Scepters of all Christian Kings; I shall first clear and confirm it by Gods own distribution of various Gifts and powers to the Members of his mystical body the Church, and members, faculties of the bodies, souls of men by one & the self-same spirit, thus emphatically expressed, 1 Cor. 12 4, to 12. Now there are diversities of Gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are differences of administrations. but the same Lord; and there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which wor∣keth all in all: For to one is given by the Spirit the word of Wisdom; to another the word of Knowledge by the same Spirit; to another Faith by the same Spirit; to another the Gifts of Healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of Miracles; to another Prophe∣cy; to another Discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues; But all these worketh that one & the self-same spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will, Compared with v. 18. 25. God hath set the members every one of them in the body (natural)See 1 Cor. 15. 37, 38. AS IT PLEASETH HIM, that there should be no Schism in the body, appointing them all their distinct Offices, places under one head the seat of the soul, which rules and directs all the other Members in the discharge of all natural, civil, moral and divine actions, diversified, denominated only by & from their various objects so stiled, not the person, power, head or facultie, by which they are all performed, being but one and the same. As GodPsal. 97. 2. Psal. 9. 59. Psal. 10. 16. the great King over all the earth,22 24. Mat. 6. 13. whose is the Kingdom and the power,Mum. 1, 2. Col. 1. 16.

Job. 12. 18. by his indivisible Supream authority; And as by one and the self-same power, spirit, he also distributes varie∣ties of Gifts, Graces, Offices, to the Members of his Spiritual body the Church, & di∣stinct faculties to one and the same reasonable Soul in man in which they are united (as vegetation, sense, reason, memory, will, judgment, affections, &c.) with distinct offices places to every member in the body natural: without erecting any plurality of Supream Powers, parts, principles, heads, souls, in himself or them, from which these diversities of
Gifts and their operations issue: So Kings and Soveraign Powers, (Gods Vicars and Ministers upon earth) by that one and the same Supream Authority vested in them by God for Government of all sorts of Subjects, and all sacred or civil Corporations under them, whether Pagans or Christians; may and do exercise all sorts of civil and Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions under them in person, or by their Delegates and Sub∣stitutes; without any real division in their Soveraign power, continuing still one the same, or erectng two distinct specifical Powers, the one Civil, the other Ecclesiastical in themselves or others. or, as their Soveraign Royal Power when exer∣cised about Martial affairs, is stiled a Military power, and the Courts wherein it is ju∣diciay executed are stiled Martial Courts, because the matters, persons in and about which it is exercised are such. And when employed in matters, Courts of Law and Ju∣stice is called a Civil or Legal Power, and their Courts, Courts of Common or Civil Law, because the businesses are such; And when versed in Maritine affairs or causes, is called A Maritime or Admiralty Power, and Admiralty Court: and when in Civil matters of Equity only, it is then phrased a Chancery or Equitable Power, and the Court wherein it is acted, a Court of Chancery: So by the self-same reason when it is employed in or about divine, sacred, Ecclesiastical things or persons, it is then stiled An Ecclesiastical power, the Laws concerning them, and Courts wherein these Laws, powers are exercised, the37 H: 8. c. 17 1 E. 6. c. 2.

All which doth evidently appear in this Orginal President of Supream Jurisdiction in Moses, the first Soveraign Governour over Gods people, when originally made both a Kingdom, & Church by Gods own institution; wherein the High Priest Aaron and his Sonnes had no share at all in the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, though the Priesthood was setled on them, but Moses enjoyed, exercised it intirely, without any Partition made by God between him and Aaron, to divide these powers equally between them as Co-heirs.

Indeed their position, That there is but one Supream Head and Fountain of all Spiritual and Regal power on Earth in every distinct Kingdom and Church, is an undubitable truth, as these Pontificians and Popes themselves assert. But that it was ever vested in the High Priest under the Law, or Popes under the Gospel, but in Moses, Kings, and other Supream Magistrates; and that they de∣rive all their Temporal Authority from Priests, Popes, not they from Kings and Su∣pream Civil Governors, is a notorious untruth, as this Original president of Moses and Aaron, with others following will irrefragably evince.

Moses and Aaron among HIS PRIESTS; Whence they inferr; That as Moses and Aaron were the chief among the Priests in the Old Testament: So Peter was ordained head of the Apostles, and Origi∣nal of the Apostleship in the New, and the Pope as his Successor: And as Moses was con∣stituted a God unto Pharoah, and judged the people of Israel: So the Pope is the God of the Emperor, the First Priest, the Vicar of Christ the High Priest, and the Cardinals assisting him, are Priests of the Levitical kinde, by whose assistance he Iudgeth all Criminal causes, not only Ecclesiastical, but likewise Civil and mixt; Moses as a Priest being only a Type of the Pope, as were Melchisedec and all those that were Kings as well as Priests before the Law given; asDe Planctu Ecclesiae l. 1. Art: 13. Glossa in Gratian Di∣stinct: 22. 66 De Poenitentia. Distinct: 3. Alvarus Pela∣gius and other Pontificians conclude, with very great confidence. To which I answer, 1. That Moses neither before his flight out of Aegypt, nor during his absence before his return thither, nor whiles he abode there to deli∣ver the Israelites from their bondage, nor after their deliverance, was ever made or constituted a Priest, much less an High Priest, by God, (for ought we read) but only Exod: 27. 21. cap: 28. throughout. c. 29. 1. c. 40. 12 to 17. Levit. 9 & 10 Aaron, with his sonnes and Levites. 2ly. Had Moses been an high Priest as well as Aaron, as these assert, there had then been two high Priests at once, and so two Supream heads of the Church, not one: and so the high Priest could not be a proper Type of Christ, theHeb. 2. 17. c: 3. 1. c, 4. 8, 4. 15. c. 3. 10. c. 6. 20. c. 7. 16. c. 8. 1. 3. c. 3. 11. c. 9. 22. sole high Priest and head of his Church, nor of St. Peter, or the Pope, his pretended Vicar General by divine Right. 3ly. The Scripture is ex∣presse, that Aaron only was the chief Priest, not Moses, and that thereExod. 18. 1, &c. c. 40, to 17 neither was nor ought to be any more high Priests but one at a time; Therefore Moses could be no high Priest. 4ly. Moses in the 99 Psalm, and all other Texts where he and Aaron are mentioned, is put and named in the first place before Aaron, and asserted by Levit. 21. 10. Num: 15. 25, 28. Josh: 20. 1. 2 Kings 22. 2, 8. Neh. 3. 1. 20. Isa: 4. 1. 12, 14. c. 2. 2, 4. Zech: 3. 1, 8. Mat: 26. 51, 57. Acts 4. 1. Hebr. 9. 7, 25. Bartholomeus Buxiensis, Thierry, and other Glossers, to be greater then Aaron in two respects, in the very Priesthood it self; Therefore he, not Aaron, was the chief high Priest: and so all Popes pretences for their Supremacy drawn from Aarons high Priesthood, must vanish into smoak; The rather, because we frequently read in Scripture, that Moses not only COMMANDED AARON, but likewise stripped him of his garments, and girt them on Eleazer his Sonne and successor a little before his death. 5ly. Psalm 99. doth not evince Moses to be a chief Priest as well as Aa∣ron, no more then the rest of the people; as is evident by the coherence with verse 5, 6.Exod: 4. 28, 29. c. 5. 1. 4. 20 & above 100. other Texts. Exalt ye the Lord our God and worship at his foot-stool, for he is holy; Moses and Aaron among his Priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his Name; these cal∣led upon the Name of the Lord and he heard them: this passage relates to Numb. 25. 6. when Moses and Aaron and all the Congregation were all weeping and worshipping God together promiscuously intermixed with Phinehas and the other Priests,Glosia in Gratian dist. 22 as also in Joel 2. 16, 17.Numb. 20. 25. to 29. So as the sole argument hence is this; Moses and Aaron worshipped and called upon the name of the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle mixed promiscu∣ously with the other Priests, as Samuel did with the people when they called on Gods name; Ergo, Moses (and by consequence all the people too) were high Priests as well as Aaron: So that the Popes absolute Soveraign Monarchy as well in Temporal as Civil things being thus grounded on Moses his mistaken Priesthood, must needs fall to the ground, and be for ever exploded upon the premised considerations; and because his Successor (no high Priest nor Priest at all) enjoyed, exercised the Sove∣raign Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction as well as Temporal in the Israelites Church, and State. 2ly. I shall demonstrate this Propositions truth, by Joshua, who succeeded Moses in the Supream Civil Authority, to whom the Israelites not onlyJosh. 1. 16 c. 4. 14. promised the self same obedience in all Spiritual as well as civil things, which they yeelded to Moses, but he likewise exercised the same Soveraign Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction as Moses had done, as these Ten instances irrefragably prove. 1. HeJosh 3. 6. to 17. c. 4, 5, &c. 15, to 22. commanded the people to sanctify themselves to morrow, and commanded, dire∣cted
the Priests when to take up, and how to carry and dispose of the Ark of the Covenant and declared the words to the people which God himself immediately spake unto him. 2. HeJosh. 5. 5. to 15. circumcised all the uncircumcised Israelites with sharp knives, and kept the Passeover, formerly omitted, by special directions given to him from God; not to the Priests. 3. By Gods special direction He commanded theJosh. 6. 1. to 17.

Joshua a little before his death (not the Priests)Joshua 24 1. to 29. assembled all the Tribes of Israel to Sechem, and there calling all their Elders, Heads, Judges, Officers, who pre∣senting themselves before God, he repeated the Histories of Gods great mercies to them from Terah his time till then, and commanded them to serve the Lord in sincerity and truth, and to put away all the gods which their Fathers had served, renewed the Cove∣nant between God and them, set them a Statute and an Ordinance in Sechem, and wrote all the words thereof in the Book of the Law of God, and set up a stone for a witnesse un∣to them, lest they should deny their God. And penned the History stiled Joshua During all this time of Moses and Joshua's Governments, we find not one syllable of any Ecclesiastical Supream Authority, exercised or claimed by the High Priest, Priests or Levites, severally or joyntly, but only by Moses and Joshua themselves, in all the forecited particulars; Which Popes and Popish Prelates would repute most strange and uncouth, should Christian Emperors, Kings, Princes now exercise the like Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and confine them only to Preaching, Administration of the Sacraments, reading Masse or Common-Prayers, and those other essential Ministeri∣al duties, which they delegate for the most part to poor Curates; as they do their pretended Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction and Judicatories to their Vicars Generals, Chan∣cellors, Officials, Commissaries, and other such party Officers, the more to fleece the people, and ease themselves from Trouble or Clamors. 3dly. After the death of Joshua, though the High Priest, Priests and Levites were all setled in their possessions and offices in his life, yet we read of none of them in all the Book of Judges, when the people of Israel were very idolatrous, wicked and most needed Ecclesiastical censures to reform them, that did ever use the least Ecclesiastical Authority over them: Therefore doubtlesse they had none vested in them, or else were intollerably negligent, and blame-worthy.

All properly spiritual and ecclesiastical Crimes, belonging rather to Papal and Pontifical, then regal Jurisdiction and Coertion as they are now reputed; yet all and every of these are recorded to be perpetrated, but not corrected in the least, because in those days there was no King in Israel; Therefore questionless, all the su∣preme, Civil, Ecclesiastical power to restrain & punish these offences, was wholly vested in the King; not in the high Priest, Priests, or Levites, of which they had then store in Israel. And had this supreme spiritual Authority been in them, these Texts had been very impertinently inserted, and should rather have run in this Dialect; In those days there was no high Priests or Priests in Israel, (nor any Ecclesiastical Court or Judge, therefore) every one did that which was right in his own eyes. If any object,Object. that Ely the high Priest judged Israel forty years, Judg. 4. 18. and that Samuel, next high Priest after him, judged Israel all his days, till he was old, built an Altar unto the Lord at Ramah; and when he grew old, made his two sons Judges over the people, Judg. 7. 15, 16, 17. c. 8. 1. to 8. Therefore the high Priests had then the soveraign Jurisdiction as Priests. I answer;Answer. The Argument is most absurd; for by the like Consequence they may argue,Judg. c. 4. v. 5. Deborah a woman, the wife of Lapidoth judged Israel; and the Children of Israel came up to her for Judgement, and she delivered them out of Sisera his hands, who sorely oppressed them with his Chariots and Army: Ergo, Debora as a woman had then Soveraign Jurisdiction over them. 2ly. They judged them not as Priests, but supreme Magistrates. 3ly. It seems the chief Ecclesiastical power was not in Ely, when he judged Israel, but in the Elders of Israel, by2 Sam. 4. 3, & 5. 13. their send∣ing for, and fetching the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto them in the Camp, to save them from the enemies, against Ely his Will; 4ly. He was very remiss and indulgent to, inflicting no civil nor ecclesiastical punishment upon his sons, though sons of1 Sam. 2. 12. to 36. Belial, whose wickednesse was great before the Lord, both in lying with the women that assembled at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation; and forceably taking away from those that sacrificed to the Lord, the flesh of the Sacrifices of those that came to offer, how much & when they pleased, without burning the fat presently, so that they made men abhor the offerings of the Lord; His Sons presumed thus impudently to abuse the people, because their father judged Israel, who only gave them a mild Re∣prehension, when he heard of their evil reports from all the people: Which miscarria∣ges of his sons in their Priest-hood, and himself in his Judicature,1 Sam. 2. 27, &c. sharply re∣proved by a man of God, were most severely punished of God1 Sam. 4, 11, to the end. by their slaugh∣ter and untimely deaths, the ruine of their families, and loss of the Priest-hood, the taking of the Ark of God by the Philistines, and slaughter of thirty thou∣sand footmen in one day. This was the Judgement befel the first Priest and his house, who took upon him the supreme civil power and magistracy. 4ly. Though Samuel himself was a1 Sam.  & c. 9. & 10. just Judge,1 Sam. 11. 3, 4. 1 Sam.  c. 8. 1, to 13 yet his sons were wicked, (n) turning aside after Lucre, perverting Judgement, in so much that all the Elders of Israel came to Samuel, complaining against them, and peremptorily desired him, (o) TO MAKE THEM A KING OVER THEM to judge them like all the Nations: not a Priest, being so weary of Priests supreme Government, that they would never permit him nor his sons to judge and govern them any longer, and were never satisfied till they had a King, which he made them by Gods direct on and Election much against his own will. 5ly. All the Priestly Offices and Jurisdiction he used towards them and Saul, was but to1 Sam. c. 12. & 15, 16. pray without ceasing for them, giving them good instructions, and reprehending them for their sins, telling them, But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed both you and your King, his declaring Saul King by Gods election and the peo∣ples doubled peremptory demand of a King, and approbation of Saul, when presen∣ted to them; and his anointing David when a privat person with oyl King after Sauls
rejection by God, they were only Acts of Ministry; not of Supream Ecclesiasti∣cal Jurisdiction in the High Priest above the King; as I shall prove in its due place more largely in the cloze of this Chapter. 4ly. When God setled the Kingdom of Israel upon2 Sam: 7, 8. to the end. Ps. 89, 3, 9, 29. 1 Chron. 17. David and his posterity, in performance of hisGen. 17. 6 16. c. 35. 11. promises to Abraham, Sarah and Iacob, that KINGS should come out of their loynes, he translated the Supream Ecclesiastical as well as Civil Juris∣diction to them, which they enjoyed, exercised by Gods approbation; not the high Priest, Priests, or Levites: as the Scripture Annals attest. 1. Davia (Acts 13. 22 a man after Gods own heart, which fulfilled all his will) not long after he was anointed King over Israel and Iudah,2 Sam. 6. 1, to 20. 1 Chron. c. 13, & 15, & 16, 1, 2 assembled all the whole Congrega∣tion, Priests, Levites of Israel, and went and removed the Ark of God from Gibeah, with great triumph, joy and shouting, to the House of Obed-Edom, and afterwards into the place, tabernacle in the City of David which David had there chosen & pitched for it, and offered there burnt-offerings & peace-offerings before the Lord, and he blessed the people in the name of the Lord. 2ly. At the second removal of the Ark1 Chron: 25. 1, 2, to 29. he assembled not only the Elders, but the chief Priest and Levites; informing them of their error in carrying the Ark in a cart at its first removal, contrary to Moses command, for which God made a breach upon them; and thatNumb: 4. 2. 15. Exod. 25. 14. None ought to carry the Ark of the Lord, but the Levites, for them had the Lord chosen to carry the Ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever; For violating which precept, Uzza was smitten to death before the Lord; Hereupon David commanded the Priests and Levites to sanctify themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel upon their shoulders, as Moses commanded; and to appoint Sin∣gers with instruments of musick and lifting up their voices, to sing before it, when they re∣moved it to the City of David; which command they punctually obeyed. 3ly. He appointed & ordained certain of the Priests and Levits to minister by turns before the Ark of the Lord,1 Chron: 16. 4, to the end. c: 21, 29, 30. and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel continually, prescribing them what instruments of musick they should use, what Psalms and Praises they should sing, (most, or all of them compiled by himself) what burnt-offerings they should offer upon the altar of the Lord morning and eveing continually, according to the Law of the Lord, and to minister before the Ark continually, as every dayes work required: And appoint∣ed others of the Priests and Levites to minister continually in like manner before the Ta∣bernacle of the Lord that was in the high place at Gibeon. 4ly. He purposed, contrived, propounded to Nathan, and ordained the building of a standing House and Temple, in∣stead of a moving Tabernacle and Tent, for the Ark and worship of God, and intended himself to build it,2 Sam: 6. 1 Chron: 17. c: 18: 11: cap: 27. to c. 29. 1 Chron. 21. 18. to 30. Psal. 24. 10, to 20. had not God inhibited him, because he was a man of Warre and had shed much blood, and appointed Solomon his Son and successor to build it; he pro∣vided all sorts of materials for the building, and exhorted all the Princes and Elders of the people to a liberal contribution towards it. 5ly. The Angel of the Lord com∣manded David, to go and set up an Altar to the Lord in the threshing-floor of Ornan, who accordingly went up at the saying of the Lord, and build there an Altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the Lord, who answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering. 6ly. When he was old, and had made Solomon King, he gathered together all the Princes, Priests and Levites, and when he had numbred the Priests and Levites, he appointed them their several Courses, Services, Offices, Duties they should perform before the Lord from time to time, as well before as af∣ter the Temple was built, all which he set down in writing. 7ly. He, as Moses, as∣sembled all the Princes of Israel, and before all the Congregation, in the audience of God, gave Solomon & them charge to serve and fear God,1 Chron. 28. 1, to 14: 20, 21. and build the Temple. Which done, he gave to Solomon the pattern of the Temple and of the Houses thereof, and of the Treasures thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the Mercy-seat, and the pattern of all that he had BY THE SPIRIT, of the courts of the House of the Lord, and of all the chambers round about, of the Treasuries of the house of God, and of the dedicated things; AND FOR THE COURSES OF THE PRIESTS AND LEVITES, and for all the work of the Service of the House of the Lord, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord. And David said unto Solomon, Be strong and of a good courage, and do it; fear not, nor be dismayed, for the Lord God, even my God will be with thee, he will not fail thee nor forsake thee, untill thou hast finished all the work for the service of the House of the Lord: And BEHOLD THE COURSES OF THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES FOR ALL THE SERVICE OF THE HOUSE OF GOD; and there shall be with thee for all manner of wrkmanship every
willing skilfull man for any manner of service, and ALL THE PEOPLE WILL BE WHOLLY AT THY COMMAND. 7ly.1 Chron. 16, 7, to 38: 2 Sam: 23. 1, 3, &c: Luke 20: 42: Acts 1 16. c: 2. 25. c. 4. 25. Rom: 4: 6: c: 11: 3: Heb: 4. 7. David (as King) not the Priests, compiled all or most of the Psalms and Prayers afterwards sung or used in the Temple, recorded in the Books of Samuel, the Chronicles, and compiled together her in the Book of Psalms, continually read, sung, used not only in the Temple and elsewhere by the Jew∣ish, but in all Christian Churches generally; and more frequently read, sung, com∣mented upon, then any other Book of Canonical Scripture. By all which memora∣ble particulars, and1 Kings 1 34, 38. command to the Priests to annoint Solomon King, it is most evi∣dent, that the whole Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over persons, causes things, relating to Gods Worship remained intirely in David as King, and no part of it in the Priests.Ps. 95: 2: Ps: 105, 2: Eph. 5: 19: Col: 3: 16: Jam: 5: 13: 5ly. King Solomon his Sonne succeeding David, by his Supream Ecclesiastical power, First,2 Chron: 1. to c: 5: 2 Kings 6. to c. 9. built and finished the Temple according to King Davids modell, and then commanded all the Elders and Princes of Israel, with the Priests and Levites, to carry the Ark and place it in the Temple. 2ly: The1 Kings 8. 2 Chron. c. 6, & 7. King (not the Priests or Levites though all present) dedicated and consecrated the Temple with a most Divine heaven∣ly from of Prayer, answered and approved by God, in sending down fire from heaven which consumed the burnt-offerings and sacrifices, and filled the House with his glory, so that the Priests could not enter into the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lords House. 3ly. He2 Chron. 7 also hallowed the middle of the outward Court by offering burnt-offerings and peace-offerings there. 4ly. He2 Chron: 8 12, 13. appointed all burnt-offe∣rings to the Lord after a certain rate every day, (according to the commandement of Mo∣ses) on the Sabbath, and on the New Moons, and on the solemn Feasts of unleavened bread, of Weeks and of Tabernacles. 5ly He2 Chron. 5 11, 12. assembled all the Priests and Levites to Jerusalem at the Temples Dedication, not in their courses: But that solemnity ended, He (as King)2 Chron. 7. 6, &c. appointed (according to the order of David his Father) THE COUR∣SES OF THE PRIESTS TO THEIR SERVICE, AND THE LEVITES TO THEIR CHARGES, to praise and minister before the Lord as the duty of every day re∣quired; Porters also by their courses for every gate, FOR SO HAD DAVID the man of God COMMANDED: And THEY DEPARTED NOT FROM THE COM∣MANDEMENT OF THE KING VNTO THE PRIESTS AND LEVITES CONCERNING ANY MATTER, or concerning the Treasures. Here is Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction vested in, and exercised by this King in and over all Ecclesi∣astical persons, matters, and exact canonical obedience yielded to King Davids, and King Solomons Canons; not to the High Priests, Priests or Levites, who had then no power to make or impose such Canons or Injunctions, as Popes and Popish Prelates now doe, without any Scripture president for their warrant. 6ly. This King was the inspired penman of three whole Books of Canonical Scripture, the Proverbs, Solo∣mons Song, and Ecclesiastes; but no Priest or Levite we read of either in his or his Father Davids reign. 7ly. He (as King)1 Kings 2. 26, 27, 35. thrust out Abiathar FROM BEING PRIEST TO THE LORD, banished him from Jerusalem, and might have put him to death for his Treason in crowning Adonijah King, but saved his life for this reason, because he had born the Ark of the Lord God before David his Father, and been afflicted with him in all his afflictions, and put Zadoc the Priest in his room. Here is Re∣gal Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction exercised over the High Priests themselves. 6ly.2 Chron. 14. 3, 4, 5. &c. 1 Kings 15. 8, &c. King Asa (as King) First, took away the Altars of the strange Gods, and the High-places, and brake down the Images, and cut down the groves through all the Cities of Judah, and commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of their Fathers, and to do the Law and the Commandements; and afterward did the like in Benjamin, and the cities he had taken from Mount Ephraim. 2ly.2 Chron. 15. 10, to 16. He renewed the Altar of the Lord which was before the porch; and gathered all Judah, Ephraim, Benjamin, and others to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices of the spoils they had taken, unto God; which done, He (as King) made them enter into a Covenant, to seek the Lord God of their Fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman; and they sware unto the Lord with a loud voice, and with shoutings, with trumpets, and with cornets, and all Judah rejoyced at the Oath for they had sworn with all their heart. 3ly.2 Chron. 15 16. 1 Kings 15 13. He removed Maa∣chah his mother from being Queen, because she had made an Idol in a Grove, and burned her Idol at the brook Kidron. 4ly.2 Chron. 15 18. 1 Kings 15 16. He brought into the house of the Lord all the things, gold, silver, vessels, himself and his Father had dedicated. All evidences, acts of his Soveraign Spiritual Jurisdiction.
4ly. King Johoshaphat his Sonne, 1.2 Chron. 17. 7, 8, 9. commanded the Levites, accompanyed with some Princes, to oversesee, encourage, assist them to go and teach Gods Law to all the people throughout all the Cities of Judah, and to carry the Book of the Law with them, which they did accordingly, 2ly. He2 Chron. 19 4. went out again the second time through the people, from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim, and brought them back to the Lord God of their Fathers. 3ly. He appointed not only2 Chron. 29. 5, to the end. See Deut. 17. 8. to 14. Temporal Judges, City by City, through all Judah, but likewise Judges Delegates at Jerusalem in cases of appeals be∣tween blend and bloud, Law and Commandement, Statute and Judgements, wherein he joyned some of the Levites, Priests and chief Fathers of Israel, and Amaziah the chief Priest, in all matters of and judgements for the Lord (as his subordinate Judges, recei∣ving their Commissions from him) and gave them an Excellent admonition how to judge, & proceed uprightly. 4ly.2 Chron. 20. 3, &c. He proclaimed a solemn Fast throughout all Judah to come to Jerusalem to seek the Lord for help against a great host of invading Enemies; where he (nor the Priests) stood in the Congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the House of the Lord before the Court; and made a most pertinent effectual Prayer to God, which God an∣swered with a miraculous victory, causing his enemies to destroy one another, with∣out fighting them; and giving his Army all the spoil: For which victory he commanded them to return to Jerusalem to give publike thanks to God. 5ly.1 Kings 12. 5. to 17. King Jehoash commanded the Priests to repair all the breaches of the Lords House with the moneys, and the dedicated things brought into it; and called for and reprehen∣ded Jehoiada the High Priest and the other Priests for their negligence in not repairing them as he commanded; whereupon they received no more money, and repaired the House. 6ly. King Hezekiah by his Regal power, 1.2 Chron. 29. 31, to 36. Opened the doors of the House of the Lord, (which had been shut up by his idolatrous Predecessors) and repaired them; gathered the Priests and Levites together, brought them into the Lords house; commanded them to sanctify themselves and then the house, by carrying all the filth out of the holy place, and cleansing the holy vessels: Then made a second exhortation to them, and strictly commanded them diligently to discharge their respective duties without ceasing. All which they executed according to the Command of the King in the Busi∣nesse of the Lord. 2ly.2 Chron. c. 29, & 30. He (afterwards) commanded the Priests to offer burnt sacrifices, and the Levites to praise God in the Temple, according to the Comman∣dement of David. And He set all the services of the House of God in Order. Moreover the KING, and the Princes, commanded the Levites to sing prai∣ses to the Lord with the words of David, and they sang praises with gladnesse. 3ly. This King (taking counsel with his Princes and the Congregation at Jerusalem) 2 Chron. 30. throughout made a Decree & sent forth a solemn Proclamation, inviting & commanding all Judah and Israel to keep a solemn Passeover at Jerusalem on the second Moneth; whereupon a great multitude then and there assembling, they took away the Idols, altars, and cast them into the book Kidron, and killed the Passeover; Whereupon the Priests and Levites being ashamed of their bacwardness in this service, sanctifyed themselves, brought the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord, stood in their places after their manner, according to the Law of Moses, and sprinkled the bloud. 4ly. Hezekiah (not the Priests) pub∣likely 2 Chron. 31. throughout. prayed to God, to pardon those who prepared their hearts to seek God, though they were not sanctifyed and prepared according to the purification of the Sanctuary; and spake comfortably to the Levites that taught the good Law of the Lord. 5ly. This King 2 Chron. 31 12, 15, 16, 17. Appointed the Courses of the Priests & Levites after their Cour∣ses, every man according to his Service; appointed the Kings portion for all morning and evening sacrifices for every day, Sabbath, Feast, as it is written in the Law of the Lord; and commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the Priests and Levites that they might be encouraged in the Law of the Lord; whereupon all the people brought in the First-fruits and Tithes of all things abundantly; which He∣zekiah commanded to be put in store-houses built by his command, over which he appointed Rulers, to distribute to every Priest and Levite his portion. All undoubted Badges of his Supream Ecclesiastical Authority. 7ly. King Iosiah by his Regal Jurisdiction: 1.2 Chron. 33. 3, &c. Purged Judah and Jerusalem from their high places, groves, carved Images and molten Images, brake down the Altars of Baal, and cut down the Images that were above them, and brake in pieces the carved and molten Images, and stamped them to powder; and strowed it upon the graves of them that
had sacrificed to them, and burnt the bones of their Priests upon their Altars: and so did he in the Cities of Manasseth, Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Napthali. 2ly.2 Chron. c. 34. throughout. He assembled all the Elders of Judah, inhabitants of Jerusalem, Priests, Levites, and all the people great and small into the Temple, and HE READ in their ears all the Book of the Covenant that was found in the House of the Lord: Then the King stood in his place, and made a Covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his Commande∣ments, Testimonies and Statutes with all his heart, and with all his soul; and caused all there present to stand to the Covenant and Oath. 3ly.2 Chron. 34, 33. He took away all the abomina∣ble things out of all the Countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel (Priests and people) to serve the Lord their God: And all his dayes they departed not from serving the Lord God of their Fathers. 4ly.2 Chron. 35. 1. to 20. He assem∣bled the Princes, and he kept a most solemn Passeover to the Lord in Jerusalem the 14. day of the first moneth: And He set the Priests in their Charges; and en∣couraged them in the service of the house of the Lord; and commanded the Levites that taught all Israel, to prepare themselves by the Houses of their Fathers after their courses according to the writing of David King of Israel, & according to the writing of Solomon his Son; & said to them, stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the divi∣sion of the families of the Levites; So kill the Passeover, and sanctifie your selves, and pre∣pare your Brethren that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Mo∣ses; Whereupon they all prepared, performed their respective offices and duties in celebrating the Passeover, as this pious King prescribed. Lo here no lesse then 7. most renowned pious Kings recorded in Sacred story by divine approbation, exer∣cising Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over High Priests, Priests, and Levites themselves, ordering all sacred affairs, offerings, sacrifices, Psalms, prayers courses of Priests appertaining to Gods worship, building, consecrating, repairing, cleansing the Temple, destroying Idolatry, with other particulars. 5ly. From Moses, Joshuahs and their presidents I shall observe, 1. That they are all specially recorded in sacred Writ for their eternal honors, reputations, and the 1 Cor. 10. 11. Jam. 5. 10. Jude 7. example of all other pious Kings under the Gospel. 2ly. That not one of them was ever taxed by God or the high Priests, for invading or usurping their Jurisdictions or Offices, for any of their forecited actions, injunctions, commands over them, or exercising these high points of Monarchical and Regal Jurisdiction in and over all Ecclesiastical affairs; or the essential, ceremonial parts of Gods publike worship: Which Popes and Popish Prelates would repute the highest, most sacrilegious En∣croachment upon their Ecclesiastical Rights, and Jurisdictions, if now acted by Chri∣stian Kings, Magistrates, Rulers, and excommunicate them for it by Bell, Book and Candle. 3ly. That we find no one part of Ecclesiastical power and Jurisdiction in these or any other particulars, either exercised or claimed by the high Priest, Priests Levites, either joyntly or severally, all their reigns. 4ly. There are only Two Kings (but no other Magistrate) in sacred History reprehended by the high Priest, and punished by God for invading the Priests Office and Function, and that only in one particular Ministerial, not Jurisdictional sacred action, peculiar unto Priests by Gods own restriction. The first is of1 Sam. 13, to 15. King Saul, who sending for Samuel to Gil∣gal to offer Sacrifices and enquire of the Lord for help against the Philistims, and he staying seven dayes for him, and the people scattering themselves from him; thereupon he calling for a burnt offering and peace offering, offered the burnt offering to the Lord him∣self; Which he had no sooner done, but Samuel came: and Saul telling him how he had in this extremity forced himself, and offered a burnt offering to the Lord. Samuel thereupon said to Saul, Thou hast done very foolishly, thou hast not kept the commandement of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee, for the Lord had now established the king∣dom of Israel upon thee for ever: but now thy kingdom shall not continue. The second is2 Chron. 26. 16, to 22. King Vzziah, who being lifted up with pride and prosperity to his destruction, transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn in∣cense upon the Altar of incense; whereupon Azariah the Priest went in after him with fourscore more Priests of the Lord that were valiant man, and withstood the King, and said unto him, It pertaineth not to thee Vzziah to burn incense unto the Lord, but to the Numb. 16. 17. Exod. 30. 7. Luk. 1. 8. 9. Priests the Sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense; Go out of the Sanctuary, for thou hast trespassed, neither shall it be for thy honour from the Lord God. Then Vz∣ziah
was wroth with the Priests, and took a censor in his hand to burn incense; whereupon the Leprosie rose up in his Forehead before the Priests in the House of the Lord, from beside the incense Altar, which Azariah the chief Priest, & all the Priests looking upon, drave, & thrust him out from thence; yea, himself also hasted to go out, because the Lord had smit∣ten him: And he continued a Leper until the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house being a Leper, for he was cut off from the house of the Lord, and Jotham his Sonne was over the Kings house, judging the people of the Land. Had the exercise of Supream Ecclesiastical power in all the premised particulars been any usurpation of the Priests Office in Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon, Asa, Jehoash, Hezekiah, or Josiah, no doubt God would have punished them as exemplarily for it, as he punished King Saul, and King Uzziah for offering a burnt offering, and burning incense upon the Altar of incense; Or as he didNum. 16. 1, to 20. Corah, Dathan and Abiram before them; for rebelling and usurping the Priests Office in burning incense with their censers, as Ʋzziah intended to do; Or as he punished and slew1 Sam. 6. 19, 20. the men of Bethshemesh, for looking irreverent∣ly into the Ark; and1 Chron. 13. 9, 10. 2 Sam. 8. 6, 7. Vzza for stretching out his hand to hold the Ark steady when it ook in the Cart; when asNumb 4. 15 1 Chron. 1. 2. none but Levites were by Gods special precept to come near, bear, or touch it; whose office all these directly invaded, for which they were thus sig∣nally punished by God himself; But since neither of all these Kings, Rulers, received any check, punishment at all from God, or the high Priests, but on the contrary, praise, honour, blessings from God, and chearfull obedience from all the high Priests, Priests, Levites themselves, for these their sacred Ecclesiastical transactions; they were doubtlesse no parts of the high Priests, Priests or Levites Offices, but of their own proper, inherent Supream Magistratical and Regal Authority, vested in them for these ends by God himself. 6ly. When the2 Kings 17 & 25. 2 Chron 36. Kings, Kingdoms of Judah and Israel were destroyed for their Ido∣latry, and both Kings, Princes, people carried away Captives into foreign Nations, so that they hadHosea 3. 4. c. 10. 3. Ezech. 17. no King nor Magistrate of their own to govern them, the sacred story records, that even Heathen Kings exercised Supream Authority over them in all Re∣ligious and Ecclesiastical matters, as these presidents demonstrate. 1. The2 Kings 17 25, to 20. King of Assyria sent one of the Priests they had carried away captive, to the Nations he had placed in and about Samaria, instead of the Israelites, to teach them the manner of the God of the Land, and to fear the Lord. 2.2 Chron. 36. 22. to 30. Ezr. 1. through∣out, c. 31, &c. Isa. 44. 25. c. 4 1. 13. God stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia, to make a publike Proclama∣tion through all his kingdom in writing, for every man that would to go up to Jerusalem, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel (who had charged him to build it) and that all should assist them with silver, gold, beasts, besides the free-will offering for the House of the Lord; Whereupon God stirring up the spirits of the chief of the Fathers of Judah, Ephraim, Priests, Levites, and others to undertake the work, King Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the House of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzer had taken from thence, and put in the house of his Gods, and delivered them to them by number, all which they carried to Jerusalem for the use of the Temple when re-built; and all they that were about them (in obedience to Cyrus royal Proclamation) strengthned their hands with vessels of gold, goods, beasts and pretious things, besides all willingly offered. Whence God said ofIsay 44 28. c. 45. 1. Cyrus, He is my Shepherd, and shall fulfill all my pleasure, saying to Jerusalem thou shalt be built, and to the Temple thy foundations shall be layd; and stiled him, HIS ANOINTED. Vpon which Proclamation and Grant of Cyrus, the Jewes set up the Altar, offered Sacrifices, and laid the foundation of the Temple, as King Cyrus, King of Persia had commanded them. 3ly. KingEzra 5. 13. to 17 c. 6. throughout. Darius confirmed and enlarged this Decree of Cyrus, commanding his Officers not to hinder the building, to furnish them with moneys out of the Kings tri∣bute for the work, and with young Bullocks, Lambs, Rams for burnt offerings of the God of Heaven, wheat, salt, wine, oyl, according to the appointment of the Priests at Jerusa∣lem, to be given them day by day without fail; that they may offer Sacrifices of rest to the God of Heaven, and pray for the life of the King and of his Sonnes; clozing his Decree thus; Also I have made a Decree, That whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon, and let his house be made a Dunghill for this; And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there, de∣stroy all Kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter or destroy this House of God which is at Ierusalem: I Darius have made a Decree, let it be done with speed; Whereupon the Iewes built and finished the House, offered Sacrifices,
set up Gods worship in it, according to the commandement of the God of Israel, and according to the Commandement of Cyrus, Darius and Artarerres King of Persia. 4ly. ThisEzra 7. c. 8. 24. to the end. King Artaxerxes sent Ezra the Priest up to Jerusalem, and gave him sundry Vessels for the Lords house, with a large Commission to like effect with that of Darius, recorded Ezra 7. superadding, Whatsoever is commanded by the God of Heaven, let it be done diligently for the house of the Lord of heaven, for why should wrath come upon the King and his sons. And thou Ezra (as my Commissioner) after the wisdom of thy God, set Magistrates and Judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the River, all such as know the Law of thy God, & teach ye them that know it not. And whosoever will not do the Law of thy God, and the Law of the King, let judgement be executed eedily upon him, whether unto death, or unto banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment; (all Temporal and Ecclesiastical Censures to be executed by Civil Magistrates, not Ezra the Priest) Upon receipt of which Commission, Ezra used this Thanksgiving: Blessed be the Lord God of our Fathers, which hath put such a thing as this into the Kings heart to beautifie the House of the Lord, &c. Which Commission he punctually pursued, and delivered it to the Kings Lieutenants and Governors; who thereupon furthered the people and the House of God. This King likewiseNeh. 2. 7, 8, 9. granted his Royal Letters to Nehemah, commanding the Governours there to give him Timber and stone for the building of the Temple; who as the Kings Lieute∣nant over the Jewes there, exercised Supream Ecclesiastical Authority in building the Temple directing and ordering the Priests and Levites, setting up the publike wor∣ship of God, observing the Sabbath and solemn Festivals, constituting publike Fasts, and putting the Priests from their Priesthood, and the Levites who could not prove their pedi∣grees; causing all of them that had married strange wives to enter into a Covenant, to walk in Gods Laws, given by Moses, not to marry with strangers, pay all their tithes, offerings, first-fruits for the maintenance of Gods worship, Priests and Levites, whom he set in their courses and respective offices; as is recorded at large in Neh. cap. 5. to the end of the Book penned by himself as is conceived, though a Layman, and no Priest, 5ly.Esther 4. 17, to 32. Mordecai the Jew, who was next to King Ahashuerus, and Esther the Queen, by this Kings consent, instituted and by their own Decrees confirmed, the dayes and feast of Purim, wherein God gave them rest and deliverance from their Enemies, to be dayes of feasting and gladnesse, and of sending portions to one another, and gifts to the poor, and that these dayes should be remembred and kept through every generation, every family, every province and every City; and that these dayes of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them from their seed. And many conceive Mordecai was the penman of this Canonical History, though no Priest. 6ly.Dan. 3. 1, to 30. King Nebuchadnezzer, as he exercised the Supream Ecclesiastical Au∣thority within his Empire, in Erecting a golden image, and commanding all his Subjects of what condition or Nation soever, to fall down and worship it, under pain of being cast into the fiery furnace; which Decree all but Shadrac, Mesac and Abednago obeyed; he commanding them to be cast into this furnace for disobeying his Decree: So after their miraculous preservation in, and deliverance out of this furnace without any touch or smell of fire; he made this memorable pious Decree; That every people, Nation and Language, that spake any thing amisse against the God of Shadrac, Mesac and Abed∣nago, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a Dunghill, because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort. 7ly. TheJonah 2. 5. to 10 King of Nineveh, when he heard tydings of Jonah his Message from God which he cryed in the streets thereof by Gods command, Yet forty dayes and Nineveh shall be overthrown; to prevent this denounced Judgement, caused it to be proclaimed and published throughout Nineveh, (BY THE DECREE OF THE KING AND HIS NOBLES, not Priests) saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock taste anything, let them not feed, nor drink waeer, but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God; yea let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hand; who can tell if God will turn and repent from his fierce anger, that we perish not; whereupon they fasted, and put on sackcloth, from the grea∣test unto the least, and the King himself was covered with sackcloth and ashes, and they turned from their evil way, and God pented of the evil he said he would do unto them, and did it not.
By all these presidents recorded by the Spirit of God in Canonical Scripture, it is infallibly evident; That from Moses, till the last King of Judah and Israel, and during their Captivity; yea from the very first chapter in Genesis, till the last of Malachi, the Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in and over all persons, things, causes in and over the Church and people of God, resided totally in, and was exe∣cuted by the Supream Temporal Magistrates, Kings, Governours, (and so in Pa∣gan kingdomes too) and was never so much as once seated in, claimed, usurped, or managed by any oneEx ea parte qua illud Sa∣cerdotium in Veteri Testa∣mento carnale erat et terre∣num erat tere∣nae potestati, scil: Regali subjectum, Alvarus Pelagius De Planctu Eccles. l. 1 Art: 5 High Priest, Priest, Levite, or other Ecclesiastical person whatsoever, no not in divine and sacred affairs; much lesse is there the least sha∣dow of any such transcendent Jurisdiction in them, over Kings and Civil Magistrates, or their Subjects, as all Popes, (and most Popish Prelates, Priests too of inferiour rank) now claim, usurp, exercise, by a pretended Divine Right, not to be found out or really grounded in the least on any place or president in the Old Testament, from Adam till our Saviours incarnation. 7ly. After the Jewes return from the Babylonish Captivity, though the High Priests during their unsetled estate, frequent warrs with, and captivity to the Ro∣mans, and others, usurped, exercised some kind of Ecclesiastical and Civil Jurisdiction too, which God never transferred to them by divine Authority, nor any of their predecessors exercised under their Judges or Kings; yet the Supream Civil and Ec∣clesiastical Authority (which they frequently annexed to the Civil) remained alwayes in their Chief Temporal Princes, Kings, whom they made their High Priests too, or they made themselves both Princes, Kings and High Priests by usurpation, fraud and bloodshed.

After their Conquest by the Ro∣mans, the Roman Emperours and their Deputies, had the Soveraign power even in Ecclesiastical things and causes, though the high Priests, Princes, Elders and Rulers of the people assembled in a Council (in imitation of their Sanhedrim) usurped to them∣selves both a Civil and Ecclesiastical power in religious matters, having aJohn 7. 30, 32, 45, 46. c. 11. 47, 48, &c. 57. c. 18. 3. to 40. c. 19. to 38.

After Christs death, this Conventicle of Chief Priests, Elders, Priests, Pharises and Scribes,Acts c. 4, 5, to 25. c. 5. 17. to the end. twice apprehended, examined the Apostles for preaching in the Temple, commanding them to preach no more in the name of the Lord Jesus; which they refused to do: whereupon they only threatned and let them go at first; but when brought before them the second time for preaching openly in the Temple, and filling Jerusalem with their doctrine, notwithstanding their threats and inhibitions, they then beat and let them go; charging them, not to speak any more in the name of Jesus. Yet they were so farr from obeying their commands as Legal, or them as the Supream Ecclesiasti∣cal power to which they were bound in conscence to submit, that on the contrary, Acts 5. 42. they daily in the Temple and in every house ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ. Soon afterActs 6. 12. o 15. c. 7. 1, 2, &c. Stephen was brought before this Council, and there accused of blasphemy, and in the midst of his Apology stoned to death by the rude multitude.

Paul, by Letters and Authority from the High Priest, made havock of the Church, and appre∣hended those that professed Christ, whether men or women, and haled them to prison, perse∣cuting them even to strange Cities, and left them in bonds: Yet when he was converted, and preached Christ, himselfActs 23. 1, 2, 4, 5. 2 Cor. . 6. c. 11. 23,  was apprehended and brought before the Council, and Ananias the High Priest, who commanded him to be smitten on the face when he began to speak, and he was 5. times beaten with rods, receiving 40. stripes save one, as a penal pu∣nishment; Yet neither the high Priest nor the Council were the Supream Judges in Causes Ecclesiastical, but the Roman Governours, Rulers, and Caesar; Hence the
high Priest, with the Elders and Council, by Tertullus their Orator, accused Paul, first before Felix the Governor forActs 25. 1, to 27. being a stirrer up of sedition among all the Jewes in the world, and ringleader of the sect of the Nazarens; before whom Paul made his defence; Afterwards he was accused by them before Portius Festus the succeeding Governour, who demanded of him, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and THERE BE JUDGED BEFORE ME, (not the High Priest or Council) of those things whereof he was accu∣sed? Acts 26. 9, 10, 11, 12, &c. Whereupon Paul doubting his justice, made this Appeal to Caesar himself, (as Supreamest Judge in all Ecclesiastical causes) I STAND AT CAESARS JUDGEMENT SEAT WHERE I OUGHT TO BE JUDGED, &c. No man may deliver me to the Jews, I APPEAL UNTO CAESAR: Then Festus when he had consulted with the Council, answered; Hast thou appealed unto Caesar, UN∣TO CAESAR SHALT THOU GO. Festus soon after informing King Agrippa that Paul had referred himself to the hearing and Judgement of Augustus, heard him a∣gain the second time before King Agrippa; who resolved, This man might have been set at liberty, had he not appealedActs c. 26. 27, & 28. unto Caesar, to whose Tribunal he was thereupon sent a prisoner to Rome to Caesar himself, as the Soveraign Judge as well in Religi∣ous as Civil causes, persons, though a Pagan. Moreover Saint Paul having cast a spi∣rit of divination out of a Damsel at Philippi, the chief City of that part of Macedonia, it is specially recorded,Acts 16. to the end. When her Masters saw that the hope of their Gains was gon, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the market-place unto the Rulers, and brought them to the Magistrates, saying, These men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our City, and teach customes which are not lawfull for us to receive, neither to observe, be∣ing Romans: And the multitude rose up together against them, and the Magistrates rent off their cloathes, and commanded to beat them; And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the Jaylor to keep them safely: who ha∣ving received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the flocks; But the next morning upon Pauls message, the Magistrates released and brought them out of prison themselves. In fine, our Saviour foretold his Apostles Luke 21. 12. Mat. 10. 17, 18. Mar. 13. 9. They shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the Syna∣gogues, and into Prisons, being brought before KINGS & RULERS for my name sake, for a testimony against them: compared with Christs prohibition to his Disciples; Lu. 22. 25. The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship over them, and they that exercise Authority upon them are called Benefactors; But ye shall not be so: and with the forecited Texts, are a most clear convincing Evidence, that although the Jewish high Priests and Priests usurped rather a Temporal then Ecclesiastical power to fetch the Apostles before and scourge them in their Synagogues to apprehend them by theirMat. 26. 3. c. 21. 23.

As for the Jewish Supream Court, generally stiled theirMost Exposi∣tors and Com∣mentators on Numb. 11. 16.

I confesse I could never yet be satisfied by any Text of Scripture, or solid Antiquity, 1. That this Court of 71. or Sanhedrim, was a setled standing Court sitting usually at Jerusalem, and that during the Judges, Kings, and inter-reg∣nums too, till Herod put it down. 2ly. That the high Priests or any Levites were antiently Members of it; which Godwin and others utterly deny. 3ly. That they inter∣medled with any Ecclesiastical causes as Supream Judges of them, as some alleadge they did in the case of theJer. 26. 6. 10 42. Prophet Jeremiah, where when the malicious Priests, Pro∣phets, and all the people pronounced him (I conceive only by way of accusation, as in the case of Christ before Pilate, when they cryed out, Let him be crucified; not vote or Judgement) to be worthy of death; the Princes of Judah who heard tydings thereof, came up from the Kings house and sate down in the Porch of the house of the
Lord, and when they had heard Jeremiah his Apology and their clamours, adjudged, voted the contrary, that he was not worthy to die, and saved his life, which proves the Princes only, not the Priests or Prophets, to be Judges paramount, even in Ec∣clesiastical causes, persons; not the Priests, in their imaginary Consistory, Church, Council, 4ly. It is granted byDe Republ. Jud. l. 6. c. 7. Sigonius,Dr. Field of the Church, b. 5. Ch. 10. Dr. Field, most Jewish Rabbies, Antiquaries, that the Princes of Judah and Israel before the Babilonish captivity, sat Chief Presidents in this high Court, as they do in our Parliaments, and that nothing was there passed but by their assents thereto, till the high Priest after that restitution by usurpation, not right, sat Chief therein. Therefore if we admit any such Soveraign standing Court erected and continuing so long, (asSee Mr. Ge∣lapy his Aarons Rod blossm∣ing. some pretend, to erect such a Presbytery in themselves) having conusance of Ecclesiastical persons or causes as well as Temporal, or a kind of Ecclesiastical Consistory stiled a Council, which some would difference from it, (though I hold them both one and the same, erected, de∣vised by their Elders, Princes, Priests after their return from the Babilonish capti∣vity) it will no wayes enervate, but ratifie my second Proposition; That the Sove∣raign Ecclesiastical Authority in the Israelitish Church of God under the Law, re∣mained alwayes setled by Divine and Natural Right in their Kings and chief Civil Magistrates, Princes, Councils, not in their High Priest, Priests or Levites separa∣ted or conjoyned; and that the Civil and Ecclesiastical power are but one and the same in nature, distinguished only by the Civil or Ecclesiastical objects, about which they are exercised, not in their original, subject, or power it self. Before I proceed to the next Proposition, it will be necessary to answer 4. princi∣pal Arguments, Presidents, out of the Old Testament, before and under the Law, produced by Popes and their Parasites, to evidence their pretended Universal Spi∣ritual and Temporal Jurisdiction too, over the Persons, Crowns, Kingdoms of all Kings, Princes, and the Emperor himself, to dispose of them at their absolute Wills, as derived only from, and held under them; which my Chronological Method con∣fines me here to propound and answer in their order. The first is that alleged by Pope Innocent the 3d. the first Pope whoMat. Paris & Mat. Westm. Anno 1208, 1209, 1213. Holinshed, Speed, Grafton, Daniel, Fox, Baker in King John. Antiqu. Eccles. Britan. & Godwin in the Life of Stephen Lang∣ton. interdicted the Realm of England,Obiect. 1. Excommunicated King John, and by force and frauds induced him to resign his Kingdoms of England and Ireland to, and resume them from him under an Annual rent, and to do Homage to him for them as his Vassal: This Pope in an Epistle to the Emperour of Constantinople, useth this Argument, before Adams creation, to maintain his Temporal Monarchy:Innocentii 3. Opera. Tom. 2. p. 644. et cap. Solita. Ex∣travagant. de Major et obe∣dintia. Moreover, you ought to know, that God hath made two great Lights in the firmament of heaven; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: both of them great, but the other greater; Ad firmamentum igitur Coeli, hoc est Universalis Ecclesiae, fecit Deus duo magna lu∣minaria, &c. Therefore God hath made two great lights to rule the firmament of heaven, to wit, of the Universal Church; that is, he hath instituted TWO DIGNITIES, quae sunt Pontificalis authoritas, & Regalis potestas, which are The Pontifical Authority, and the Regal Power. But that which ruleth in the day, that is, in Spiritual things, major est, is the Greater, but that which in carnal things, minor, is the Lesser, ut quanta est inter Solem & Lunam, tanta inter Ponti∣fices & Reges differentia cognoscatur, (mark it) that it might be known there is as great a difference between Popes and Kings, as there is betweeen the Sunne and Moon. How great this difference is, this Pope defines not; But some illiterate Canonists andGlossa. in cap. Solita. Glossers on this Text (not well versed in Astronomy) resolve the Sunne to be 47. times greater then the Moon; whereasCom. in o∣han. de Sacro∣bosco. p. 189. Dr. Cken∣thorp of the Popes Tempo∣ral Monarchy, p. 10. Johannes Clavius and other Astronomers determine it to be no lesse then 6529. degrees greater then it: and by consequence the Pope to be so ma∣ny degrees greater then the Emperor, by this Popes Resolution in his over-erring chaire. He subjoyns. If his Imperial Highnesse would prudently consider these things, he would not make or permit the Patriarch of Constantinople, a great and honourable Member of the Church, to sit on the left side near his Footstool; when as other Kings and Princes (sicut debent) AS THEY OUGHT, reverently rise up to, and assign them a venerable Chair next them (on their right hand:) Nos autem, etsi non increpando scripserimus, potuissemus tamen rationabiliter in∣crepare.

Barcl. de Potestate Papae, c. 13. & Dr. Crakenthorp of the Popes Temporal Mo∣narchy, p. 7, . Pope Sixtus the 5. was so angry with Bellarmin, for not asserting the direct, but oblique, dominion of Popes over Kings in all Temporal things in this Apology, that he purposed to have burnt and totally aboli∣shed this his Book AS HERETICAL; And that upon reading of Alex: Carerius his Book (purposely written against Bellarmins) Adversus Impios Politicos & Haereticos hujus Temporis; branding all for impious Hereticks who denyed the Popes direct Uni∣versal Dominion in Temporal things, though they acknowledged it obliquely in-order to, and absolutely in all Spiritual things: In this applauded Book,Lib. 2. c. 5. nu. 12. De Rom. Pontifi∣ce. Carerius asserts, There is that proportion between the Pope and the Emperor, as is between the Sun and Moon, not only in Magnitude, but Splendor too. For, as the Sun is far more excellent and eminent then the Moon, seeing she borrows her splendor and light of the Sun; SO IS THE POPE THEN THE EMPEROUR; seeing his Authority depends on the Pope, and is derived from him: Our ownDoctrinalis Fide, Tom. 1. Venetiis 1571. b. 2. Artic. 3. cap. 74, 75. p. 177, &c. Thomas Waldensis alluding thereunto, profes∣sedly asserts against Wickliffs defence of our Kings Supream Jurisdiction over Priests and Preltes, That Priests (as well as Bishops) ARE TO BE PREFERRED BE∣FORE ALL OTHER EARTHLY PRINCES WHATSOEVER, and the Priest∣hood before the Kingship, as far as the Flesh before the Spirit, Gold before Lead, the Soul before the body, and Heaven BEFORE EARTH; in proof whereof he spends two whole Chapters, andDe Planctu Eccles. l. 1. rt. 10, to 66.

That God created the Sunne to Govern the day, and the Moon the night, by a direct divine inviolable and irrevocable Institution, observed from the Creation till now: when Pope Innocent and his flatterers can produce any such divine Law and constitution, made either by God at the creation, or by Moses for the Jews High Priests Supremacy, or by Kings, Princes, or Christ himself under the Gospel, to convince any rational Christian, that Popes and Prelates are the sole Universal Governours in the Church, but Kings and Emperours only in the World; That Popes or Bishops were ever typified by the Sunne and Moon; the Church and Earthly kingdoms by Day and Night; That there is as vast a difference between the Amplitude of Jurisdiction, and Splendor of Popes, Bishops, Kings and Em∣perours, as is between the Grandeur and Brightnesse of the Sunne and Moon; That Kings and Emperours derive all their Regal Authority, Crowns, Kingdoms; Splen∣dor, Excellency in the world from Popes Miters, or Bishops Crosiers; not God him∣self; (as the2 Chron. 9. 8.

Or when they can evidence, that God hath constituted Popes to rule, govern, and give light to the whole World by day only; and to the Emperour a∣lone (not Pope) by night; as the Sunne and Moon govern, alternis vicibus, without encroaching on one the others turns; when as Popes, Prelates usurp the Temporal Rights of all Emperors, Kings, as well as Ecclesiastical all the year long; I shall then subscribe these Popes and Doctors conclusions as Catholick verities; whereas yet I cannot but conclude them2 Thes. 2. 10, 11. strong Antichristian delusions, lyes, which few sober men will credit. In the mean time, since Kings, Emperors were long before Popes, Bi∣shops, who derive all their Lordly power, Splendor, Temporalties, Jurisdictions, Bishopricks, precedency above other Ministers only from their donations; not they their Crowns, Kingdoms or Regal Authority from Popes or Bishops, as all Histories attest, against their Papal pretences to the contrary: Since the Moon doth frequent∣ly ecclipse the Sunne by the interposition of her body between it and the earth; as the Papal and Pontifical power hath frequently ecclipsed more or lesse the power, splendor of our own and other Kings and the Roman Emperours) but these Suns ver ecclipseth the Moons, but only the interposition of the earths Ball betwixt them, in their Divine jurisdiction, being very little, granted to them out of meer

To which I reply, 1. That Samuel anointed Saul and David to be Kings, not at, 1 Sam. 10. 1. c. 16. 1, to 1. but before their Coronations, and that by Gods special command, as his Minister only, not their Superiour: whence Samuel told Saul,1 Sam. 15. 17. The Lord anointed thee King over Israel: and David alwayes stiled him,1 Sam. 12 19 5. c. 24. 6. 10. c. 26. 9, 11, 16, 23. 2 Sam. 1. 14, 16. THE LORDS ANOINTED, not Samuels; refusing to offer the least violence to his person, upon this account: So David is stiled2 Sam. 19. 21 c. 22. 51. Psal. 18. 51. Gods anointed, who tells him,2 Sam: 12. 7. 2 Kings 3. 6. 12. I anointed thee KING over Isra∣el; and called him,Psal. 20. 6. Psal 28. 8. Psal. 132. 17. Mine anointed; adding,Psal. 89. 20. With my Holy oyle have I (not Samuel) anointed him. 2. Neither Samuel, nor any other of the High Priests who anointed Saul, David, or any King of Judah or Israel, did ever from thence either claime or exercise the least Jurisdiction or Superiority over their Persons, Crowns, Kingdoms, in Spiritualties or Temporalties, as Popes and Prelates claime, exer∣cise over Christian Kings and Emperours, Crowned by them: Nor yet Jehojeda the High Priest, who not only Anointed and Crowned Joash King, but was the principal Instrument in preserving and restoring him to his Crown, when Usurped by Athaliah; But they all dutifully submitted to, and obeyed their Royal commands, ordinances, in all Ecclesiastick and Divine, as well as civil things, as the premises evidence. 3ly. Not only the High Priests, but2 Chron. 23 Kings 11. Elders and People anointed2 Sam: 2. 4. c. 5. 3. 1 Chron. 11. David and2 Kings 23. 30. 2 Chron. 20. 1. Jehoahaz Kings, without any Priest or High Priest that we read of: Yet none of them claim∣ed, exercised any Supremacy over these Kings upon this account. 4ly.1 Kings 1. 43, 44, 45. Zadoc the
Priest, and Nathan anointed Solomon King, by King Davids special command, not their own Authority, who put1 Kings 1. 7. 19, 42, c: 2: 26, 27, 35. Abiathar the chief Priest from being Priest unto the Lord, because he sided with Adonijah, and crowned him King, and made Zadock Priest in his place. Here the very King deposeth the chief Priest, and tells him he deser∣ved also to dye for anointing Adonijah: not the high Priest the King, for being crow∣ned and anointed by Zadock. 4ly. One of the2 Kings 9. 1, to 13. sons of the Prophets a young man by the Prophet Elisha his command from God (not the high Priest) anointed Jehu King, saying; Thus saith the Lord, I HAVE ANOINTED THEE KING O∣VER ISRAEL; which having executed, he opened the door and fled. If this young Prophets meer anointing Jehu King, gave him an absolute Jurisdiction over him, in spiritual and temporal things, (as these Pontificians argue) then this Minor Prophet likewise gained the supream Jurisdiction over the high Priests themselves, and Za∣dock and Nathan over Abiathar the chief Priest, by anointing Solomon King, as well as over Jehu and Solomon, which they dare not averre. 5ly. Popes themselves (who pretend to this absolute Soveraign power over Emperors, Kings, by reason they crown and anoint them) are both elected, crowned and anointed Popes by Bishops and Cardinals only, not Popes, as all theirPlatina, Onu∣phrius, Ana∣statius, Augu∣stinus Cheru∣binus, Beyer∣linck & others, in their Lives; Baronius, Spondanus, Genebrardi Annales et Chonica. Historians, Pontificale & Ceremoniale Romanum attest: Will Popes then inferr, Ergo they are higher, greater in Power, Jurisdiction then Popes, and may dispose of the Papacy, Popes, and depose them at their wills? Besides in theCeremoniale et Pontificale My Unbishop∣ing of Timothy and Titus, p. 84, 85, &c. Church of Rome, all other Episcopal Church∣es, and our English Church, meer Presbyters at first, and of latter ages inferiour Bishops and Clergymen both elected, anointed, consecrated and installed all their Patriarchs, Metropolitans, and Archbishops: Will it therefore follow, that they are superiour to Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Archbishops in Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and may remove them at their wills? If not, then this grand Argument of Popes, Popelins, for the Popes, Prelates supremacy over Emperors, Kings, Churches, king∣doms in Temporals and Spirituals, because they anointed, crown them, is a meer ridiculous Non-sequitur. 6ly. TheSee Seldens Titles of Ho∣nour, Pontifica∣le Romanum, the severall Histories of these kingdoms & Archbishops of Canteburies Lives. The 2d Part of My Signal Loyalty of Gods true Saints, &c. to their Sove∣raigns, p. 14, to 321. Kings of England, France, Spain, Hungary, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Bohemia, Scotland, Cyprus, and others have been usually anointed, crowned by their own Bishops, the Kings of England most frequently by the Archbishops of Canterbury, yet some times by the Archbishop of York, or Bishop of London, or Winchester: Are therefore these Bishops that crown, anoint them Kings, thereby intituled to be their Soveraign Lords in all Temporal and Spiritual things, and advanced above all other Archbishops and Bishops in their Realms not present at their Coronation, Consecration, and may dispose of their Bishopricks, Crowns, kingdoms at their pleasures? If not, I hope the Roman Pontifs will from henceforth disclaim this grand Argument for their Supremacy, as most false and absurd. The rather because none of the Jewish high Priests, Priests ever pretended to, much lesse exercised such a power over any of their most impious, idolatrous Kings, as Popes both claimed and exercised over pious Christian Kings, Emperours, to their eternal infamy: And because Kings are actual Kings by desent or election, before their Coronations. The 3d.Object. 3▪ and principal warrant from the Old Testament which Popes and their Parasites insist on for their Supream Athority over all Christian, Pagan Kings and Emperors Persons, Crowns, Kingdoms, to dispose, depose, root out, destroy them at their wills; is that Text of Jeremy 1. 10. The Lord said unto Jeremiah; See, I have this day set thee over the Nations, and over kingdomes, to root out and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant. Whence they thus argue. Jeremiah the Priest, to whom this power under the Law was given, was but a Type of the Popes, Christs Vicar General his absolute Dominion, power under the Gospel, of whom this Text was principally meant; Therefore Popes may pull down, root out, destroy and throw down all Kings, Emperors, Kingdoms at their pleasures, and dispose of them at their wills.

But to dismount these aspring Roman Bishops and Rooks,Answer. I shall desire them to de∣monstrate; first, how Jeremiah, only one of theJer. 1. 1, 2. private Priests of Anathoth, not the high Priest of the Jews, was in this and this alone, a Type of the Pope, or Peter? If not, then their pretences, argument are false: If yea; then let them produce some Scripture warrant for it. 2ly. How Jeremiah and the high Priest too, from whom they claim their power, can be both Types at once of the Pope and his Papal pretended prerogatives? 3ly. Whether the High Priest had any such Supremacy vested in him, as Jeremiah here received. If not, then Jeremiah was paramount him in Jurisdiction, and might remove, extirpate him at his pleasure, as well as whole Nations, Kingdoms, being a Member of the Israelitish Nation and Realm, and so the High Priest not Supream, as they formerly argued? If yea; What need of any such special Commission from God to Jeremiah, alone; without the high Priests privity or delegation, to the prejudice of his inherent high priesthood? 4ly. Whether this transcendent power was given only to Jeremiah as an extraordinary Prophet of God sanctifyed in, and called from the womb? or, as he was an ordinary Priest? If as an extraordinary Prophet only, as the Text expresly resolves; then Popes can lay no Title to it, till they can prove themselves such extraordinary, sanctifyed, called Pro∣phets, as Jeremiah, and produce the like special divine Commission to each of them from God himself, as he received. If as to an ordinary Priest alone; then every ordinary Priest among the Jewes heretofore had, and by like consequence every or∣dinary Masse-priest in the Church of Rome hath as absolute a Soveraign power over all Kings, Emperors, Nations, Kingdoms of the world, as the high Priest or Pope himself pretends to from this Text; and then where is his sole Monarchy over them when equally and intirely divided amongst so many inferiour Priests, or any Kings or Kingdoms safety? 5ly. Whether it extends to Kings, there being not a word of Kings, but only of Nations & Kingdoms, in this Text? 6ly. Whether Jeremiah by virtue of this Commission, did either challenge or exercise any such Soveraign Authority overJer. 1. 1, 2, 3. 4 Amon, Jehoiakim, or Zedekiah Kings of Iudah, & their kingdom, under whom he lived; (though very wicked and idolatrous) by deposing them from their thrones, absol∣ving their Subjects from their allegiance, and setting up other Kings in their steads? If not, it is infallible, then this was no Commission,See Jerom, Theodoret, Ri∣chard de Sancto Victore, Lyra, Tostatus, Dio∣nisius Carthu∣sianus, Calvin, & others in this place. for such a rooting out, destroying, pulling and throwing down, as these Pontificians dream of, but of far different Nature; to wit, only by denouncing Gods judgements against them, that if they persevered in their sins, God himself would root out, and destroy, pull and throw them down; but if they repented upon his menaces, he would build and plant them. This God himself declared to be his only meaning, even to Ieremiah himself and to us, ch. 19. 5. to 11. Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying; O House of Israel, cannot I do with you as this Potter, saith the Lord? Behold as the clay is in the Potters hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel. At what instant I shall speak concerning a Nati∣on, and concerning a Kingdom to pluck up and pull down and to destroy it; If that Nati∣on against whom I have pronounced turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. And at what instant I shall speak concerning a Nation and concerning a Kingdom, to build and to plant it; If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them: Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying; Thus saith the Lord; Behold I frame evil against you, and devise a devise against you, return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your wayes and your doings good. This way of working out, pulling down, building up and planting Kings and king∣doms, and no other, he useth throughout his prophecy, especially ch. 25. 17. to 38. where God commands him to take the wine cup of his fury at his hand, and to make all the Kings and kingdoms of the world to drink it, that so they may spue and fall and rise no more, and become a desolation for their sins, if they repented not. This was the rooting up and pulling down which Samuel exercised towards Saul the first King of Israel and his kingdom; when he thus publikely menaced them,1 Sam: 12 24, 25. But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be destroyed, both you and your King.1 Sam. 15. 23, 26. c. 13, 14, 15▪ Because thou [Saul] hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being King; thou hast not kept the commandement of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee, therefore thy kingdom shall not continue, the Lord (not I) hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee; The Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath comman∣ded him to be Captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord com∣manded.
This was that rooting, up, pulling down, rending, removing of Kings, kingdoms, Na∣tions used by all the2 Kings 11. to 14. See Jere∣my, Ezechiel Daniel, Hosea▪ Nahum, Oba∣diah, Amos. Prophets and Prophecies in the Old Testament, and particu∣larly by Gods own denunciation against Niniveh by Jonah,Jonah 3. Yet forty days, and Nini∣veh shall be destroyed; which the Kings and peoples joynt humiliation, and repen∣tance upon his preaching, in turning from their evil wayes, prevented. 7ly. S. Bernard, when Pope Eugenius, like his Predecessors, insisted on this Text, as giving him and them a transcendent power, Dominion over Kings and kingdoms, returned this answer thereunto; That it gave them no Dominion at all over their Persons, Crowns, possessions, but only to extirpate their VicesDe Conside∣ratione ad Eu∣genium Papam lib. 2. Non est quod blandi∣tur Celsitudo; Sollicitudo major. Quale est hoc de paupere & abjecto levari super Gen∣tes et regna? Non ad dominandum, opinor; Nam & Propheta cum similiter le∣varetur audivit, Ut evellas & destruas, & disperdes, & dissipes, & aedifices & plantes: Quid horum fastum sonat? Rusticani magis sudoris schemate quodam labor spiritualis expressus est. Et nos igitur ut multum sentiamus de nobis, impositum senserimus Mi∣nisterum, non dominium datum. Non sum ego major Propheta, & si fortè po∣testate; sed meritorum non est comparatio. Haec loquere tibi, & doce teipsum qui alias doces Puta te velut unum aliquem de Prophetis: An non satis ad te? et mium. Sed gratia Dei es quod es. Quid? Esto quod Propheta, nunquid plus quam pro∣pheta? Si sapis eris contentus mensura quam tibi mensus est Deus: nam quod amplius est, a malo est: Disce exemplo Prophetico praesidere, non tam ad imperitandum, quam ad sactitandum quod tempus requirit: disce sarculo tibi opus esse, non scep∣tro, ut opus facias prophetae. Et quidem Ille, non regnaturus ascendit, sed ex∣tirpaturus. Putas ne et tu invenias aliquid elaborandum in agro Domini tui? Et plu∣rimum Non planè totum quivere, emundare Prophetae aliquid filiis suis Apostolis, quod agerent reliquerunt, aliquid ipsi Parentes tui tibi. Sed nec tu ad omne sufficiens. Ali∣quod profecto tuo relicturus es Suecessori, & ille aliis, & alii aliis usque in finem. This was St. Bernards sence of this Text, and severe check to the Pope himself for abusing it, against the true scope and meaning. 8ly It is Gods incommunicable Prerogative which no meer mortal is authoritativly capable of;Job 12. 16, to 22. To loose the bond of Kings and gird them with a girdle; to lead Princes a∣way spoiled, overthrow the mighty, and powr contempt upon Princes;Psal. 110. 5. Psal: 2. To strike through Kings in the day of his wrath, and break Kingdoms in pieces like a Potters vessel;Ps. 149. 7, 8. To bind Kings in chains, and Nobles in fetters of iron, for their crying Rebellions against his Soveraign Majesty (as he did2 Kings 5. 23 c. 25. 1. 2 Chr▪ 33. 11. c. 36. 6 Ezech. 19. 4, 9, Hoshea, Zedekiah, Manasseh, Jehoiakim, others, thus bound and carried away captive to Aegypt and Babilon by their invading Kings) Dan: 2. 21. Hosea. 13. 10, 11. He removeth Kings and setteth up Kings; The most high King of heaven only ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and those Kings that walk in pride against him, he is able to abate, and translate their kingdoms to others, as he did Dan: 4. 37. 25. 32, to the c. 5▪ 18. to the end. Nebuchadnezzer, and Belshazzer, who recognised this Soveraign Empire to be peculiar to him alone. Let Popes therefore beware, how they usurp or intrench upon this Prerogative of the most high, to the prejudice of any anointed Christian Kings2 Chron. 9. 8. who sit upon his throne as his Viceroyes; and highest affront to the Sove∣raign Jurisdiction of Christ himself, the King of Kings. The Fourth and most colourable pretext, is from the president of Azariah the Chief Priest and other Priests withstanding King Uzziah to burn incense upon the altar, and thrusting him out of the Temple; (the only example in the Old Testament of any Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction exercised by the Jewish high Priest and Priests, on Prince or Subject) Whence Bellarmin and others conclude; That it isGratian caus. 11. qu. 1. caus. 23. qu. 1. caus. 15. distinct. 9. Bellarmin: A∣pologia pro Re∣spons. ad Jacobum Regem. de Romano Pontif. lib. 5. cap. 4. Dr. Crakenthorp of the Popes Temporal Monarchy, Dr. Ames Bellarminus Enervatus, Tom. 1. p. 275. Lawful for Popes, Bi∣shops and Priests by their own inherent Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction to excommunicate, de∣throne Kings and Emperors too, and absolve their Subjects from their allegiance, for diso∣beying their Papal commands and injunctions. I answer 1.Answr. That all this president warrants is; That Chief Priests may lawfully diswade ambitious, wilfull Kings from doing any unlawfull actions against the ex∣presse will of God, and perchance resist them too when they attempt to offer sacrifices or act ought belonging peculiarly to their own office in their own Church∣es. But that they may either excommunicate, resist, or thrust them forth of the
Temple, for any other Offence, especially for violating or not obeying their own Papal or Pontifical Orders, Injunctions, Mandares, not expresly grounded on Gods word, this president will no wayes warrant. 2ly. They did not thrust King Uz∣ziah out of the Temple, where he actually invaded their function against Gods word, till God himself the King of Kings, whose Law he had violated, had first mi∣raculously passed sentence upon, and smitten him with the plague of Leprosie in the forehead, which they all visibly beheld: Therefore Popes and Priests may not thrust any King or Prince out of the Church for any Crime, till God himselfDan: 2. 21. c. 4. 16, 17: 25, 32. c. 5. 18, to 31. Job 12. 18, 19. 1 Tim: 6. 15. Ps. 150. 1▪ Ps. 149. 9, 1. the only King and Judge of Kings) hath first given visible sentence against him by some sig∣nal Judgement. 3ly. They thus thrust him out of the Temple, not principally be∣cause he attempted to burn incense, but because God had thus miraculously smitten him with Leprosie in his forehead, and so by Gods expresse command he was2 Kings 15. 5 2 Chron. 26. 26. 21. Levit. 13, 45, 46, 5, 6. Numb. 12. 14, 15. to be shut out of the Congregation and Church by the Law, and dwell in a house alone, that he might not infect others; this the Text renders to be the sole or main cause of his thrusting out of the Temple, dwelling in a several house, and of his Sonnes judging the people in his stead; not by the Priests, but his own appointment. 4ly. This King himself when God had thus smitten him, as the Text precisely records, hasted to go out of the Temple of his own accord, voluntarily dwelt in a house alone, and delega∣ted the government of his house and people to his Sonne; So as there was only a volun∣tary expulsion of him out of the Temple by the Priests with his own consent, not a∣gainst it; but no sequestring or deposing of him by them from his throne; he con∣tinuing King till his death, and making his Sonne his Viceroy to supply his Govern∣ment and order his house. 5ly. Here was no sentence of Excommunication thundred out against him with Bell, Book and Candle; no absolving of his Subjects from their oaths of Allegiance, no exciting of them to rebell, or take up Arms against him to dethrone him; Wherefore Popes and Popish Prelates can no wayes justifie from this president, their excommunicating, deposing Kings, Emperors, or absolving Subjects from their Allegiance, against their wills for the greatest crimes. Having removed these 4. Grand Romish stumbling-blocks, before, under the law and Gospel, out of the way of my Chronological Progresse, I now proceed to my third Conclusion. BOOK II. CHAP. III. III. My Third Proposition is, That the Supream Government of the Church after Christs Incarnation, under the Gospel, was and is vested in Jesus Christ himself, God and Man, only as he is the King (not Priest or Prophet) thereof, and as it is His KINGDOM. And that his Priestly and Prophetical Office are united to his Kingly, as the first, highest in dignity, order; not his Regal to his Prophe∣tical or Kingly Office. BEcause this is of very great Consequence, and may seem strange to Usurping Pontifs, and other Prelats, who appropriate the Soveraign Spiritual Jurisdiction Government over Christs kingdom, Church to themselves, as united to his Priestly and Prophetical, not Regal Office, and so derived wholly and immediately to them∣selves by Christ, as Bishops, Priests; not to Kings, by, from, and under whom they will not claim nor exercise it, as a flower of Christs Crown, though delegated to Kings, his sole Vice-royes upon Earth, not Popes or Priests, who are no Kings; I shall fully demonstrate its verity by pregnant Scripture-proofs. 1. It is generally asserted by all Divines Old and New; Pontificans and Prote∣stants, That King David and Solomon, (both of them1 Sam. 16. 1, to 14. 2 Sam. 2. 4. c. 5. 3. 17. c. 12. 7. Ps. 80. 2 Kings 1. 14. 33. to 49. 1 Chron. 29. 22, 23, 24. anointed by Gods special
command, to sit upon Gods throns, to be Kings for the Lord their God, his people Israel, to do Justice and Judgement, to reign over, rule  in the fear of God, and to establish them for ever; as likewise to prepare, build, consecrate a most , and holy Temple for him under the Law; were both lively Types of Christ;Psal. 45. by God with the oyl of gladnesse above his fellowes, as the son and seed of David, to be the Soveraign King (as God incarnate) over his Church, Saints under the Gospel, which he redeemed, built, sanctifyed with his own blood, adorned with all saving graces, and in which he should sit, rule as King and Soveraign Lord for ever, to govern, rule, help, protect, save, glorify it for eternity. 2ly. That Christs comming in the flesh to rule, reign in and over his People for ever, is alwayes prophecied of, and promised in the Old Testament, under the Title and Office of a King, not Priest or Prophet; and that he shall sit upon the Throne of David his Father to govern them as a King, not Priest; Witnesse I say 32. 1, 2. ch. 16. 5. & ch. 9. 6, 7, 8. Behold a KING shall raign in righteousnesse, and Princes shall rule in Judgement: and a man shall be as an hiding place from the Wind, and a covert from the ten post: as rivers of waters in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. And in mercy shall his Throne be established, and he shall sit upon it in truth in the Tabernacle of David, Iudging and seeking Iudgement, and hasting righteousnesse: For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Sonne is given, and the Government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be call: Wonderfull, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the everlasting Father, the PRINCE of Peace: Of the increase of his Government and peace there shall be no end, upon the Throne of David, and upon his Kingdom, to order, and to establish it with judgement and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this. Isay 33. 22. Forthe Lord is our Iudge, the Lord is our Law giver, the Lord is our King, he will save us. Jer. 23. 5, 6. The dayes come saith the Lord, that I will raise  avid a righteous branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute Iudgement and Iustice in the Earth. In his dayes Judah shall be saved, and Israel  dwell safely, and this is his name wherewith he shall be called, the Lord our righteousnesse, &c. Ezek. 27. 22, 24, 25. And they shall be no more two Nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all. And David my servant shall be King ever them, and they all shall have one Shepherd, and they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them. And they shall dwell in the Land which I have given unto Jacob my servant wherein your Fathers have dwelt, and they shall dwell therein e∣ven they and their children, and their childrens children for ever, and my servant David shall be their Prince for ever. Hosea 3. 5. & ch. 13. 9, 10. Afterward shall the children of Israel return and seek the Lord their God, and David their King, and shall fear the Lord and his Goodesse in the latter dayes. O Israel thou hast  thy self, but in me is thy help; I will be thy King, where is any other that may save thee in all thy Cities? Jer. 33. 15, 16, 17. chap. 8. 19. ch. 9, 10. In those dayes and at that time will I cause the branch of righteousnesse to grow up unto David, and he shall execute judgement and righteousnesse in the Land. In those dayes shall Judah be saved, and Jeru∣salem shall dwell safely, and this is the name wherewith he shall be called, The Lord our righteousnesse; For thus saith the Lord, David shall never want a man to sit upon the Throne of the house of Israel. Is not the Lord in Zion, is not her King in her? The Lord is the true and living God, and an everlasting King, or King of eternity, Mi∣cah 2. 13. Their King shall passe before them, and the Lord on the head of them, cap. 4. 7, 8, 9. I will make her that was cast off a strong nation, and the Lord shall reign o∣ver them in mount Sion from henceforth for ever: Unto thee shall it come, even the first Dominion, the Kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. Now why dost thou cry out aloud, Is there no King in thee? Zach: 9. 9. Rejoyce greatly O daughter of Sion, shout O daughter of Jerusalem, Behold thy King cometh unto thee, he is is iust, having salvation, lowly, and riding upon an Asse, and upon a Colt, the fole of an Asse. Actua∣ly fulfilled at Christs triumphant riding into Jerusalem, and crying  to the Son of David, blessed is the King of Israel, and blessed be the kingdom of our Fa∣ther David,John 12. 12. Mat. 21. 1▪ , 14. Mat. 11. 1. to 12. Lu. 19. 29. to 47. that cometh in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest; as all the four Evangelists record. Zech: 14. 9. 16. And the Lord shall be King over all the earth, and in that day shall there be One Lord, and his name One. And it shall cme to passe, that every one that is left of all the Nations that came against Jerusalem, shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of Hosits. To which I shall
subjoyn these prophecies of King David himself concerning the Kingship and king∣dom of Christ, Gods Son, of his seed. Psalm 2. 6, 7, 8. Yet have I set my King upon my holy Hill of Sion. I will declare the Decree; the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my sonne, this day have I begotten thee: Ask of me and I shall give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the Earth for thy possession; Thou shalt break them with a rod (or Scepter) of Iron, &c. salm 10. 16. The Lord is King for ever and ever, &c. Psalm 29. 10, 11. The Lord sitteth King for ever: The Lord will give strength u to his people, the Lord will blesse his people with peace. Psalm 24. 7, 8, 9, 10. Lift up your Heads O ye Gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall come in; Who is this King of Glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battel, The Lord of Hosts he is the King of Glory &c. Psalm 47. 6, 7, 8. Sing praises to God, sing praises, sing praises unto our King, sing praises; For God is the King of all the earth, sing ye praises with understanding. God reigneth over the Heathen, God sitteth upon the Throne of his Holinesse. Psalm 96. 9, 10, &c. & 98. 6, 9. & 99 1, 2. O worship the Lord in the beauty of holinesse, fear before him all the earth. Say among the Heathen, that the Lord reigneth, the world also shall he estab∣lish that it shall not be moved, he shall judge the world uprightly. With trumpets and sound of a Corn it make a joyfull noise before the Lord the King, &c. For he cometh to judge the earth, with righteousnesse shall he judge the world, and the people with equity, More es∣pecially Psal. 95. 3. & 99, to 2. The Lord is a great God, and a Great King above all Gods. The LORD REIGNETH, let the people tremble: The Lord is great in Sion, and high above all people. The KINGS strength also loveth judgement, thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgement and righteousnesse in Jacob. Psal. 149. 2. Let Israel rejoyce in him that made him, let the children of Sion be joyfull in THEIR KING: Let them praise his name in the Dance, &c. Psalm 89. 18. 34, 35, 36, &c. For the Lord is our defence, and the holy one of Israel is our King, Also I will make him my first-born, higher then the Kings of the earth. My covenant will I not break, nor al∣ter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my holinesse that I will not lie unto David, His seed (King Jesus) shall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sunne before me, It shall be Established for ever as the Moon and as a faithfull witnesse in heaven. In all these Texts of sacred Story (to omit others) Christ is still prophecyed of, and promised to his Church only, under the stile of a King, Lord or Great King of the Seed of David, sitting upon his Throne, righteously judging and reigning over his people as a King, and he is sometimes stiled David their King (he being a Type of Christ) his Supream government of them being attributed, annexed only to his King∣ship, not to his Priesthood or Prophetical office, as it was in King David his Father, and the forecited kings. 3ly. That as the Scripture prophecied of, and promiseth Jesus Christ in the flesh under the Title of a King; so it stiles the Church and Saints he should reign over under the Gospel, a kingdom, wherein and over which he sits and reigns as a King for ever. This is evident by all the last recited Texts; and those I shall adde unto them. 2 Sam: 7. 13. 29. 1 Chron: 28. 7. I will establish his kingdom for ever; 1 Chr. 29. 11. Thine, O Lord, is the greatnesse, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the praise; for all in the heaven and in the earth is thine, thine is the kingdom, O Lord, & thou art exalted as head, above all, (as a King, not Priest or Prophet) both riches & honor come of thee, and thou reignest overall, and in thin: hand is Power and Might, to ake great and to give strength to all, Psal. 103. 19. The Lord hath prepared his throne in heaven, and his kingdom ruleth over All: Yea the contemplation and dis∣course of the Glory and excellency of Christs everlasting kingdom over his Church and Saints, is thus prophecied of by David, as one principal part both of their and all other Christians duty and felicity upon earth. Psal: 145. 10, 11, 12, 13. All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord, and thy Saints shall blesse thee; they shall speak of the Glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power, to make known to the Sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious maiesty of his kingdom: Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth through all Generations. In pursuance of which duty, King David himself penned two special Psalms of praise, Ps. 45. 1. My heart is inditing a good matter, I speak of the things I have made for the King &c. Gird thy sword (not Peters or the Popes keyes) upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty; and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meek∣nesse, &c. Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever, the Scepter of thy kingdom
(not Peters keyes) is a right Scepter. Thou lovest righteousnesse, and hatest wic∣kednesse: therefore God, thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladnesse above thy fellows, Hearken (O daughter) and consider, &c. So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty, for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him. The King daughter ( the Church) is all glorious within, &c. She shall be brought unto the King, (Christ Je∣sus) in rayment of needle work, they shall enter into the Kings passage, &c. To which he addeth many Psalms of like nature, especially two begenning thus: Psal: 97. 1 The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoyce, let the multitude of the  (and ours a∣mongst others) be glad thereof. Psalm: 99. 1. The Lord reigneth, let the earth tremble, &c. The Prophet Daniel presents us with this excellent description and prediction of Christs Kingdome, Dan: 2. 41. And in the dayes of these Kings shall the God of heaven set up a Kingdom which shall never be destroyed, and the King∣dom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consum: all these Kingdome, and it shall stand for ever: Thus farther illustrated Dan: 4. 3. How great are his signes? how mighty are his wonders? and his dominion is from Genera∣tion to Generation. Upon which consideration King Nebuchadnezzer himself up∣on his restauration to his understanding and kingdom, ver. 34, 35, Blessed the most high, and praised and honoured him who liveth for ever; whose dominion is an ever∣lasting dominion and his Kingdom from Generation to Generation: And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing, and he doth according to his will, in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and who can say unto him, what doest thou? King Darius thus seconded him, Dan: 6. 26. He is the living God and stedfast for ever, and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion that which shall be even unto the end. He delivereth and rescueth, &c. Dan. 7. 13, 14, 27. I saw in the night Vision, and behold one like the sonne of man (Christ Jesus) came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the antient of dayes, and they brought him near before him; and there was given him Dominion, Glory, and a Kingdom that all people, nations and languages shall serve him; his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed: An the Kingdom and Dominion and the greatnesse of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven shall be given to the people of the Saints which are of the most high; whose Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and all Dominions shall serve and obey him. To which the Prophet Micah superadds this prophecy, ch. 4. 7. I will make him that was cast farr off a strong Nation; and the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion, from henceforth even for ever. All these memorable Prophecies and Promises in the Old Testament, were particu∣larly applied to Christ and ratified by the Angel Gabriel when sent by God to the Vir∣gin Mary with the blessed Tydings of our Saviours miraculous conception by the over-shaddowing of the Holy Ghost in her womb, thus recorded by St. Luke in the New Testament, Luc. 1. 21, 31, 32, 33. Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Sonne, and shalt call his name JESƲS; He shall be great, and shall be called the Sonne of the Highest, and the Lord God shall give unto him, the Throne of his father David, an he shall reign over the House of Israel for ever, and of his Kingdom there shall be no end. All these recited memorable Prophecies, pro∣mises applied to Christ himself, his Reign, Kingdom, Kingly Office in the New Te∣stament, Lu. 1. 32, 33. Hebr. 1. 7. to 14. 1 Cor. 15. 25. 2 Pet. 1. 11. infalli∣bly resolve, That all Spiritual Dominion, Rule; Power, Judicature and Jurisdiction over the Church and members thereof, are actually vested in Christ by God the Father & for ever inseparably annexed only to his Regal, not Priestly or Prophetical Office; and that he exerciseth this Supream Lordship and Dominion over them only as a King sitting in his Regal throne, reigning over, giving Lawes to, judging, reward∣ing, punishing them, as they are his Kingdom, Subjects, who serve and obey him as their King; whose Kingdom and Soveraign Dominion over them is an everlasting Kingdom, Government, Dominion, which shall never be altered nor destroyed, nor the rights thereof invaded by his Priestly Office, nor any Apostle, Pope, Bi∣shop, Priest, or Usurpers whatsoever. 4ly. Upon this account, we find these secondary Prophecies recorded in the Old Testament, that not only all Nations, but their very Kings, Princes, Kingdomes should obey, serve, and do him homage with all humility as their Soveraign King and Lord, by, from, and under whom they hold their Crowns, and whose
, Ministers they are. Hence is that memorable prophecy of  David , on  throne he is sad to sit. Psal. 68. 24, 29. 32. They have sen thy going O God, the going of my God, my King, in the Sanctuary, &c. Kings all bring presents unto thee; Sing unto God ye Kingdomes of the earth, O sing praises unto the Lord. Psal: 72. 4, 9, 10, &c. a meer prophecy of Christ and his Kingdom un∣der the person o King Solomon his predecessor, and type; Give the King by Judge∣ment, O God, and thy righteousnesse unto the Kings Sonne; He shall judge thy people with righteousnesse, &c. He shall have Dominion also from sea to sea, and from the River un∣to the ens of the earth; They that dwell in the wildernesse shall bow before him, and his shall like the dust: The Kings of Tarshish and of the Isles shall bring pre¦sents, the Kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer Gifts: Yea all Kings shall fall down before him, and hem by their examples and authority) all Nations shall serve him. 102. 15, 16. The heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, &  Kings of the earth thy glory Psal. 138. 4, 5. All the Kings of the Earth shall praise thée, O Lord, when  hear the words of thy mouth; yea, they shall sing in the praises of the Lord, for great is th glory of Lord: Whence King David exhorting all celestial, terrestrial, and then the rational as to praise the Lord, Psal. 14. 8. begins thus with Kings: verse 11. Kings of the earth and all people, Princes & all Iudges of the earth, &c. Let them praise thy of the LORD, for his name alone is excellent, his glory is above the earth and heaven. Isay 41. 1, 2. Keep silence before me O Islands, &c. who raised up the righ∣teus ma from the east, and called him to his foot, gave the Nations before him, and made him Rule over Kings; he gave them as dust to his sword, and as driven subble to . Isay 49. 7, 23. Kings shall see and arise, Princes also shall worship, because of the Lord, that is faithfull, and the holy one of Israel. Kings and Quéens shall bow down to thee, with their faces towards the earth. Isay 52. 15. He (Christ with his ) shall rinkle many Nations, THE KINGS shall shut their mouths at, (or rather before) him; for that which hath not been told them shall they see, and that which they had not heard shall they consider. Isay 60. 3. 10, 11, 16. chap. 62. 3. The Lord shall  upon thee, and his glory shall be shewn in thee, The Gentiles shall come to thy light, and KINGS to the brightnesse of thy rising; THE KINGS of the sons of strangers shall come unto thee; unto thee the riches of the Gentiles, and THEIR KINGS shall be brought; The Gentiles shall see thy righteousnesse, and ALL KINGS thy glory. Hence the Royal Psalmist David upon this consideration, that God in despite of all heathen people, Kings and Rulers of the earth, should set up his Sonne Jesus Christ,  KING upon his holy hill of Zion (which cannot be removed, but standeth fact for ever) to whom he had given the Heathen for an Inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession; concludes with this admonition to them, to subject themselves to his Royal Scepter and Government:Psal. 2. . Be wise now therefore O YE KINGS, be instructed ye JUDGES of the earth; Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoyce unto him with trembling; Kisse the Sonne (a Ceremony used by Subjects, fdatories to Kings & Soveraign Lords, when they kneeled down before & swore Homage and Fealty to become their Men and Vassals from that day forwards of life, limb, or terrene honour; and to be true, faithfull, bear faith and true allegiance to them, continu∣ed in England till this day) lest he be angry and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is : but a little; Blessed are all they that trust in him. In all these Prophecies of Christs kingdome and Government under the Gospel in the Old Testament, Christ and set forth only as a KING and Soveraign Lord, reigning and over his ubjects as a King, not as a Priest or Prophet; and his Church stiled described  by the Name of a Church, (never once used throughout the Old Te∣stament) but only of a KINGDOM, or of. Mount Zion, or Jerusalem,. THE CITY OF GOD, where the House of the Lord. was built, his publike worship setled by David and Solomon, the Metropolis of all Kings of the seed of David, where they were crowned, reigned, and gave Judgement, as Kings; whence it was stiled . THE CITY OF DAVID, for there were set THRONES OF JUDGE∣MENT, even THE THRONES OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID: and the CITY OF THE GREAT KING (in relation to Christ himself) whence the Church under the Gospel  likewise stiled, The City of the living God, and described in all her glory, under the  of A CITY, (Rev. 21. 13. to the end; and ch. 22. 1, to 27.) wherein his Subjects serve and worship him as their LORD, GOD, KING, and
shall REIGN WITH HIM FOR EVER AND EVER; All which considered, in∣fallibly demonstrate, the Supreme Rule and Government of the Church on earth under the Law, to be vested only in, and exercised by the Kings, and Soveraign Rulers of Gods people; not in & by the High Priests or Levites; and under the Gospel in & by Christ himself only as KING and Supream Lord thereof, as it is his kingdom; not as a Priest or Prophet: and that his reign, Dominion, Jurisdiction in and over it is for ever appropriated to his Regal, not Pontifical or Prophetical office. 5ly. As the Angel told Mary a little before Christs Conception, the Grandeur, stability & perpetuity of his kingdom: So the Wisemen which came to Jerusalem to worship him, being the first-fruits of his Kingdom and Church under the Gospel, inquired after him only as a King: saying, Where is he that IS BORN KING OF THE JEWS? for we have seen his Star in the East, and are come to worship him; Whereupon he Chief Priests and Scribes being assembled by King Herod to inform him where Christ should be born; answered, At Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the Pro∣phet: And thou Bethlehem art not the least among the PRINCES of Judah, &c. for out of thee shall come A GOVERNOR, WHO SHALL RULE MY PEOPLE ISRAEL: where these Wisemen finding him with Mary his mother, they fell down and worshipped (not his mother Mary with an Impera filio, Monstra te esse matrem; Jube benedicere, &c. as Popes and their disciples daily pray unto her even now in their Offices, Primers, Mass-books set forth by Papal authority) but theMat. 2. 3. 4. 5, 16. &c. Babe, & when they had brought forth their gifts, they offered unto him Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrhe; On which placeDe Stella & Magis▪ p 265▪ Edit: Pamelii. Saint Cyprian first, and others after him, have this observation; In auro REGEM, in thure Sacerdotem, in myrrha Incorruptibilem; quamvis pasi∣bilum demonstrat. In loco humili & supellectile vili REX Regum, & DOMINUS Do∣minorum invenitur, recognoscitur, & ab aliis adoratur. And although Christ never claimed nor exercised any temporal Authority over the Kingdom of David (to which he was born heir, as Herod feared) but only over his Spiritual kingdom, which he affirmed,John 18. 36. c. 19. 12. to 32. Not to be of this world; yet he owned himself to be A KING; and John 19, 20, 21, 22. Lu 23. 37, 38. Mat. 27 37. Mar. 15 26 Pilate himself positively professed it; (though the Jews would not) by demand∣ing of them (when they cried out, to have him crucified) shall I crucifie your KING? and fixing this written Title on his Crosse (which he would not alter at the high Priests importunity) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin;—JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS; to evidence his Kingship (over his Kingdom the Church) which none of the1 Cor. 2. 8. Princes of this world (then) knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord (or King) of glory;Mat. 11. 8, t 14. Mar. 11. 15 16, &c. Lu. 48, &c. John 12. 1 14, 15, 16. c. 2. 17. as the Apostle, and Psalmist stile him:) yea the very multitude of people proclaimed him a King, when he rode into Jerusalem in regal Triumph,Ps. 24. 7, 8, 9, 10. by strowing their garments and bough of trees in the way, singing with a loud voice; Hosanna, Blessed be the King, and king∣dom of our father David that commeth in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest. After which he went into the Temple, and threw out them that bought and sold therein, overthrew the Tables of the money-changers, and them that sold Doves; by vir∣tue of his Regal, not Sacerdotal power. 6ly.Lu. 1. 45, 4 c. 8. 25. It is very observable, that Jesus Christ whiles on earth, was most usually stiled both byMat. 9. 28.  13. 51. Lu. 9. 54 c. 11 1. c. 17 4. c. 24. 34. John 13. 13. c. 14. 5 8, 12. Acts 16. 24.

Saint Peter) and by all sorts of persons who addressed themselves unto him by petition or otherwise, Lord, the Lord, my Lord, our Lord, and his other Titles of Jesus, Saviour, Christ, &c. are very seldom mentioned throughout the New Testament, by Angels, Saints, Evangelists, Apostles, or any others, but with this addition: Luke 2. 11. Phil: 2. 9, 10. Christ the Lord, Jesus our Lord, the Lord Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savi∣our, Lord God, &c. every tongue ofLuke 12. 17. Mat: 3. 21. Mar: 5. 10, 11, 12. Angels, Saints, yea ofMat: 7. 21. 22. c. 25. 11. Lu. 6. 46. c. 23. 25. Devils and damned spirits, confessing, that Jesus Christ is Lord, Lord of all, Lord and Christ, Lord both of quick and dead: which Title manyJohn 13. 13. 14. Hypocrites, and the foolish Virgins re∣iterated, saying, Lord, Lord open, &c. Which Appellation Christ himself resolved to be true;1 Cor. 8. 6. You call me Lord & Master, so I am; his Father having put all things in subjection under his feet, especially his redeemed ones, who professe this as an Arti∣cle of their faith; (r) But unto us there is but one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him: Now this Title Lord, (attributed to Christ in its eminen∣test
sense) denotes only his Regal Dominion, Lordship, and Soveraignty over them in and under the Gospel as their KING, as the penitent Theefs speech to him on the Crosse,Luke 23. 42. LORD remember me when thou commest into THY KINGDOM; the Apostles question to him,Acts 1. 6. LORD wilt thou at this time restore the KING∣DOM to Israel? Saints Pauls conclusion,2 Tim. 4. 18. THE LORD will preserve me to his HEAVENLY KINGDOM, with St Peters,2 Pet. 1. 11. For so an entrance shall be ministred unto you abundantly into THE EVERLASTING KINGDOM OF OUR LORD and Saviour Jesus Christ, and our Saviours own asseverations,Mat. 7. 21. c. 21, 22. Not e∣very one that saith LORD, LORD, shall enter into the KINGDOM OF HEA∣VEN, but he that doth the will of my father which is in heaven, necessarily evince. 7ly. After our Saviours resurrection and ascention; when God his Father highly exalted him, and gave himMat: 28. 18. all power both in heaven and earth, his Soveraign Re∣gality and Dominion in and over his Church and Kingdom, are frequently set forth in these transcendent expressions decyphering only his Regal, not Prietly or Prophetick Offices and Administrations;1 Tim: 6. 14, 15. Rev: 1. 5. c. 17. 14. c. 19. 16. Our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the on∣ly Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the Prince of the Kings of the earth; whom God the father of glory hath set at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above all principalities and powers, and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but in the world to come, and hathEphes: 1. 18, 19. put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to his Church, which is his body:Col. 1. 10, to 20. The fullnesse of him that filleth all in all; Goa hath (by the extra∣ordinary greatnesse of his mighty and glorious power delivered us from the power of dark∣nesse and translated us into the kingdom of his dear Sonne, who is the first-born of eve∣ry creature; For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities or powers, all things were created by him and for him. And he is the head of the body the Church, who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in (or a∣mong) all things he might have the preeminence: For it pleased the Father that in him all fullnesse should dwell: Compared with his other Gospel titles, ThouRev. 15. 3. King of Saints, and the united praises,Rev: 4. 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, c. 5. 11, 12, 13, 14, c. 19. 4. Rom. 17. 36. prostrations, acclamations, of the Angels, with the four beasts, and the 24. Elders, and all the Saints and Redeemed ones before Christ who sitteth on the throne, before whom they all fall, worship, and cast down their Crowns, saying, Worship and honour, and thanks and glory, and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne for ever and ever; worthy art thou O LORD to receive glory and honour; for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they were and are created: All these recited Texts resolve, that Christ is Supream head of his Kingdom the Church, not in his Priestly, Propheticall capacity or office, but only in his Regal, and reigns in it as a King, Lord, not as Priest or Prophet. 8ly.

of Christs kingdom in the Old Testament, thus recorded (as accomplished) in in the New; Rev: 11. 15. There were great voyces in heaven, saying, The King∣domes of this world are become the Kingdom (not Church) of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever. Rev: 12. 10. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Christ. 1 Cor: 15. 24, 25. Then cometh the end, when Christ shall have de∣livered up the Kingdom to God the Father, when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority and power; for he must reign till he shall put down all enemies under his feet. All and every of these Texts and considerations joyntly and severall demonstrate more clearly then the Morning Sunne; That Christs Government of his Kingdom the Church under the Gospel, is only Kingly and Monarchical, (as evenDe Romano Pontif. l. 5. c. 1. See Dr: Cra∣kenthorp of the Popes Tempo∣ral Monarchy, c. 1. Alvarus Pelagius De Planctu Eccles. l. 1. Art: 13. Gratian Dist. 15, 22, 69, 96. Bel∣larmin himself, and most Pontificians professe, argue; grounding the Popes Univer∣sal Monarchy upon it) not Pontifical or Prophetical; and that the Supreme Go∣vernment thereof is for ever intirely annexed to his Regal, not Priestly or Pro∣phetical Office; and these Offices of his united to his Regal Office as Supream, not his Regal to his Sacerdotal or Propheticall, as subordinate to them. This being an unfallible Gospel-truth, not hitherto so fully cleared, and insisted on by the Oppugners or Asserters of Popes Universal Monarchy, as was necessary, which induced me to expatiate in its probation. The second and sole Question will be; Whether Christ himself did ever delegate by any Commission recorded in Sa∣cred History all his Regal Power and Jurisdiction, or any branch thereof, to Saint Pe∣ter, or any other Apostles, Bishops, Presbyters, Evangelists, or Ministers of the Gospel? Or whether they or any of them ever justly claimed, enjoyed, exercised this his Royal Dominion, Office, Government in or over his Church on earth? If yea; as most Popes and their Parasites confidently affirm, (without the least shadow of Scripture or Verity;) let them produce the Commission or Texts, to evidence it to every mans2 Cor. 4. . conscience in the sight of God, and to all Kings, Kingdoms, Nations in the world: If not (as shall be evidenced in the ensuing Chapters past all contradiction;) I and they may then safely cry out mightily with a strong voyce, as the Angel prophe∣tically doth;Rev. 18, 2, 3 4, 21. Babylon the great (Rome) is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of Devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hatefull Bird: Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her Plagues: with violence shall she (and her triple-crown'd Pontif) be thrown down (from the pinacle of her usurped, super-transcendent power) and shall be found no more at all. Before I take leave of this Proposition, to avoid mistakes, and clear up the Truth, it will be necessary to distinguish: 1. The several sorts of Christs kingdomes. 2ly. What kind of Kingdom his Church is. 3ly. How and in what manner he reigns and governs in it, as King and Soveraign Lord over it? For the 1.

of Glory, not really different from the former, long since begun, and encreasing e∣very day more and more, by new additions of departed Saints thereto, which king∣dom shall be fully compleated, when all the Elect shall be gathered, the Church militant united to the Church triumphant & actually glorified with Christ in the kingdom of heaven.

Hence ThomasDoctrinalis Fidei, Tom: 1. l. 2. Art. c: 3. c. 76, 77. Waldensis himself (though a grand Ad∣vocate for the Popes Supremacy) layes down and proves at large these 4: Conclusi∣ons, 1.

And Gen. 49. 10. proves, That the temporal Scepter should depart from Iudah, when Christ the true Shiloh came into the world. Alvarus Pelagius (theDe Planctu Eccles: l. 1. Art. 10. to 68. grand assertor of the Popes Universal Kingship in and o∣ver Christs kingdom the Church, and all earthly Kings, Kingdoms too) informs us; That theLib: 1. Art: c: 61. kingdom of Christ hath various acceptations in Scripture; 1. It is taken for Christ himself. 2ly. For the sacred Scripture, or Gospel of Christ. 3ly. For the Church of Christ, divided into two Parts: Militant on earth, triumphant in heaven: yet there are not two kingdoms in the Church, but one kingdom; because both end in one, and there is but one King of both, and one Spirit reigns in both Churches, but diversly; for in the Church of Travellers it reigns by faith, in the Church of the blessed by open visi∣on. This Church therefore is but One for the unity of its end and beginning, but it is di∣stinguished by reason of the diversity of the state: Yet this kingdom comprehends, not only the Elect, but also all the holy Angels, for there is but one City and Kingdom of God con∣stituted out of holy Angels and men; as he proves out of Augustine, and Gratian Di∣stinct: 10. & 59. That Christ ever challenged or enjoyed any temporal kingdom upon earth, he offers not the least proof out of Scripture or Fathers; in which De Pontifice Romano l. 5. c. 4, & Recogni∣tio ejusdem, p. 33, 35. Cardinal Bellarmin himself confesseth, he could never find that Christ had any such kingdom after most diligent search, but only a kingdom in and over his Church, which is not temporal but spiritual. For the 3d. All antient, and most modern Divines of all sorts assert, that Christs immediate Government in and over his Spiritual Kingdom the Church, is Spiritual not Temporal; and that principallyEphes0 3. 16, 17.

But more of this in the two next Propositions.
BOOK I. CHAP. IV. That Jesus Christ as Supream King, Lord, Head of his Kingdom the Church, whiles on Earth never claimed, exercised, enjoyed any Tem∣poral Royal Jurisdiction, or Magistratical Authority over any of his Subjects, much lesse over Emperors, Kings, Kingdoms, Nations, or Soveraign civil Powers, nor ever deprived any of them of their Crowns, nor absolved their Subjects from their Allegiance, nor pul∣led up, cast down, or rooted up their Kingdomes, nor gave them to whomsoever he pleased: Neither did he either before, at, or after his passion, resurrection or ascention, derive any such superlative Power to Saint Peter, as his sole universal Vicar or Viceroy, nor to any other Apostle, Bishop, Priest, or Pope whatsoever. Nor delegate his Su∣pream Spiritual Jurisdiction over his Kingdom the Church militant in this world, and all the Members of it; but only committed to them the Ministerial part of his Prophetical Office (hisPsal: 110.

I Have here enlarged this Proposition, (abridged in my Prologue) the clearing whereof will prove fatal to St. Peters and the Popes pretended Universal, Regal Supremacy, and Pontifical Jurisdiction over Kings, Emperors, Kingdoms, Nations, as well in temporals as spirituals, and over Christs Kingdom, (the Church Militant on Earth) as Christs sole Viceroy, or Vicar General, to whom all his Regal and Sacerdotal power in heaven and earth, is assigned by Christ himself, if we believe their own Papal or their Parasites claims; which I shall here preise in their own words, that so their Antichristian Usurpations, Blaspemies, Impostures may more visibly appear to all Christian Kings, and the whole world, who cannot but abominate and be jea∣lous of them, though never so much devoted to the Papacy. Gratian Di∣stinct: 22, cap. Omne p. 33. Pope Nicholas the 2d. writes thus to those of Millain (who refused to obey the See of Rome,Anno 1060. and acknowledge the Popes Universal Supremacy) Christ alone hath founded, built the Roman Church upon the rock of the faith newly born, and hath committed to Saint Peter, the Key-bearer of eternal life, TERRENI SIMUL & IMPERII CAELESTIS JURA: the Rights both of the earthly and heavenly Empire: Therefore not any terrene Sentence; but that word by which heaven and earth were built, by which faculty all the Elements were made, hath founded the Roman Church: Cer∣tainly she enjoyeth her privileges from him by whom she is supported. Therefore IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED, that he who endeavoureth to take away from the Church of Rome,
the Priviledge granted her by the very chief head of all Churches, HIC PROCƲLDU∣BIO IN HAERESIN LABITUR; HIC EST DICENDƲS HAERETI∣CVS; He without doubt falls into Heresie; he is to be called an heretick, because he vio∣lates the faith, who acts against her who is the mother of faith, and is found contumacious to him, who is known to have advanced her above all Churches. On which Text Bartho∣lomeus Buxiensis, and Ioannes Thierry, make this Glosse; Papa habet utrumque gladi∣um, scilicet, Spiritualem & Temporalem, & transtulit Imperium. Pope Leo the 9. in one of hispist: 1. c. 13▪ Dr. Cakenthop of the Popes Temporal Mo∣narchy, p. 2.

The Pope (asDe Potestate Ecclesiae lib: 3. art: 3. qu: 1: in Principio Sum∣mae de Potestate Papae. Augustinus Triumphans asserts) is greater then any King or Emperor, as well in Temporal as in Spiritual Matters; and as God is the Lord of all by Universal Jurisdiction, so is the Pope, his Vicar, greater then any King or Emperor both in spiritual and temporal things. The power of Jurisdiction in temporal and in spiritual matters is immediate in the Pope alone. Yea, the Son of God hath declared the al∣titude of Ecclesiastical power (in the Pope) to be above all principalities and powers, that unto it every knee should bow both in heaven, in earth, and under the earth.

Bellarmin himself informs us; That the Pope, Jure divino, hath power over the whole world as well in temporal as in Ecclesiastical matters, is also taught by Augustinus Triumphans, Alvarus Pelagius, Hostiensis, Panormitan, Sil∣vester; and divers others; Yea Hostiensis teacheth; That Christ by his comming tran∣slated all the Dominion, even that of Infidel Princes, unto the Church, and that this Do∣minion so resides now in the Pope Christs Vicar, That he may give by his own Right the Kingdoms of Infidels (as well as Christians) to whom∣soever he will. Alvarus Pelagius seconds all these with most Hyperbolical passages and blasphe∣mies, which I cannot pretermit: Christ (De Planctu Ecclesiae. l. 1. art. 19. writes he) had all power given unto him both in Heaven and Earth, & being ascended in his humanity to his Father; lest he should leave his flock without a Shepheard, he left the care thereof to Peter and his Successors, as his Vicar General: Now the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, even in Earth: Therefore every Pope his Vicar upon Earth, hath all power in Earth which Christ had, not as very God, but as very Man. To this purpose is that which Zacharias saith of Christ, Zech. 8. His power shall be from Sea to Sea; And Ps. 72. 8. He shall have dominion from Sea to Sea, & from the River unto the ends of the Earth: Whence Ecclesiasticus speaking of the power of the Pope, saith, Eccles. 17. God hath given him power of those who are upon the Earth: For in this the Pope is Successor to Adam, the first man, for God the Son hath autonomatically and typi∣cally formed the Pope (his Vicar) after his own image and likenesse, Gen. 1. For the Pope truly represents Christ on Earth, so that he who sees the Pope with a contemplative and faithfull eye, may see even Christ himself: Whence even for this cause he said to Peter, Mat. 18. Thou art Peter, taken a Rock from me: Distinct: 21. & 1. Hunc enim in consortium individuae Trinitate assumptum, id quod ipse erat, &c. For Peter being assumed into the Fellowship of the individual Trinity, is become that which (Christ) himself was: that is from that which he was, namely a Rock; the Lord would have him to be called and named Peter: Whence according to this, Papa non est homo simpliciter, sed Deus, id est, Dei Vicarius: Whence according to this, the Pope is not simply a Man, but a God: that is, The Vicar of God. Item, Christ as a man was a King, Zach: 9. Mat: 21, & 27. Lu: 24. John 19. Psal: 72. Rom. 2. & 7. God shall raise up a Kingdom, &c. But of this universal Kingdom the Emperor is not Christs Vicar, because there are not two Vicars, as is plainly proved; Therefore the Pope is his Vicar, because there is no other Vicar, and the Kingdom of the world, is not without the Vicar of God. He thence inferrs and asserts in another Article,Ibid. l. 1. ar∣tic. 34. Although in this life the Pope should do injury or injustice to any man, or some men, (as he confesseth he may) he hath no Iudge over him; neither is he obliged to chuse Iudges or arbitrators, to whose Sentence he may subject himself, neither can he directly or indirectly be condemned; for it is impossi∣ble that the Pope himself should constitute another Superiour Prince, or Iudge, or another ArchPope above or equal to himself, sicut nec Deus Trinitas possit super se alium Deum constituere vel aequalem; as neither God the Trinity can constitute another
God above or equall to himself: He thus proceeds in another Article;Lib: 1. Artic: 3. The Church (or Pope) are not from the Empire, but the Empire from the Church; and the Pope is before the Emperor, which he endeavours to prove by 25. Arguments: I shall only touch upon some of them. As the Moon receives her dignity and her Light from the Sunne: so doth the Moon, the Emperor, the dignity of his altitude from the Sunne the Pope. As much as the spiritual life is worthier then the earthly; the spirit then the bo∣dy, gold more precious then silver: so much doth the spiritual power exceed the temporal or secular power, in dignity, honor, worth, splendor, and the order of Priests is so much high∣er then the Regal power, to which all Emperors and Kings ought to subject themselves, eve∣ry of them being subject suo simplici Sacerdoti qui ipsum solvit, ligat & judicat. All pow∣er in earth, both spiritual and temporal is given to the Pope Christs Vicar, as it was to Christ himself, Mat: 28. for in him resides the fulnesse of the Regal or Imperial Digni∣ty, that is, to take from one and conferr unto another the right of chusing the Emperor; to examine, anoynt, consecrate and crown him when elected, and by consequence to approve and reject him; all which of right belong to the Pope. That the Pope out of the plenitude of the power and keyes given to him by Christ, with this Commission, Feed my Sheep, hath a power and jurisdiction over all men upon earth de jure, although not de facto; which he may exercise when ever he is able, or willing; by which power he may lawfully punish all Pagan, Heathenish Kings, Nations, and Idolaters in the world, as well as Christians for breach of the Law of Nature only, and command all Infidels who are subject to his Jurisdiction in earthly things, to admit the preachers of the Gospel, and pu∣nish them if they do not obey him; yea, the Pope alone and none other of right, can contend with, and denounce war, and invoke the secular power against them. Christ was a true temporal King, and by consequence the Pope his Vicar. He that in this point will exclude from himself the darknesse of understanding, must consider the Pope, non hominem, sed Deum quodammodo qui non puri hominis, sed Veri Dei vicem gerit in terris. As Christ is God and Man, most perfectly participating both Natures, and God and Man are both one Christ, perfect God and perfect Man: So his Vicar General and Singular, the POPE: (participat cum Christo quodammodo naturam Di∣vinitatis quoad Spiritualia; & humanitatis quoad temporalia,) participates with Christ after a sort the Nature of the Divinity as to Spiritualities; and of the Humanity as to Temporalties. As by force of the Orthodox faith it is heretical to lay down two Beginnings, 24. Quaest: So it seems to be heretical, to make two several Vicars equals to each other in earth in point of right. As therefore no believer doubts Jesus Christ was both King and Priest, and King of heaven and earth, because all things were made by him (one person in two Natures) So no Catholick ought to doubt but his Chief Vicar General on Earth hath likewise both Powers; Yea it would not be farr from Heresy pertinaciously to affirm the con∣trary; because this would be as it were to deny the Son of God to be the Maker of the Earth and a King, and so to make Duo principia, That therefore thou mayst not seem an Arch Heretick, let this be thy Catholick Faith, that as there is but one God incommutable: so there is but one his Vicar General upon Earth: Cui omnes Angeli, i. homines, debent esse subjecti, & in omnibus obedire; to whom all Angels; that is, Men, ought to be sub∣ject, and to obey in all things; whose Ship is stable and immutable: For thus the inferiour Hierarchy accords with the superiour when all men serve and obey his Vicar in earth, as all Angels serve and obey God in heaven: but when they grow proud and resist, the inferior is disturbed, and the superiour Hierarch is offended. Gratian caus. x. qu. 3. All things are put under the Popes feet, except God alone, who hath put all things under him, 1 Cor. 15. In anotherLib: 1. Artic: 76, 78. article he asserts, That the Pope is King of Kings, of the Emperor and Spiritual Kings, and every Member of the Church Militant, who ought Iure Divi∣no to be subject to him: That he hath a plentitude of all Temporal and Spiritual power in him in several respects. 1. Because it is a universal power; No person in the Militant Church (nor Infidel in some sense) being exempted from, but subject to it. 2ly. Because all temporal and spiritual power whatsoever ordained by God for the government of christians or men, is comprehended in his power. 3ly. Because all power in the Church is derived from his, and ordained for it: and he is the beginning and end of a∣ny
power whatsoever; Therefore every human power is DE JURE subject to him. 4ly. Because it is not exceeded, nor overcome by any other human power, but over∣comes and exceeds all other powers. 5ly. Because it is limited, or ordained, or judged by no other power; but it limiteth, ordaineth, judgeth all other powers. 6ly. Because it is not restrained, nor bound by any Lawes made by the Pope himself; for it may act me∣diately by other powers, or immediately by it self whatsoever it shall think sit. It may like∣wise act both according to the Lawes it sets down, and besides them when it shall judge convenient. And for this cause his Power is said to be, Sine Numero, Pondere et Mensura. Without number, because it extends to innumerable persons even all men in the world, whether Beleevers or Infidels. Without weight, because it is not confined to one place, but extends it self to all Churches throughout the world. And without measure, as to the act and manner of acting; because it is after a sort Immense both in acting, and in the manner of acting; For, as the Spirit was given to Christ man without measure, John 3. and to others it is given only according to the measure of the gift of Christ, 1 Cor: 12. Eph. 4. Rom: 12. So to Christs Vicar, the Pope, is given a Power without measure, to wit, in a certain Immensity, Exrav: de Major, & Obedientia Solita, c. Nos autem. But to others is given a power according to their measure of participation of this Immense Power: And although this Power of Christs Vicar is without Number, Weight or Measure, yet notwithstanding it deter∣minates to other powers, Number, Weight and Measure, Causa xv. qu. 1. pervenit. 13. qu. 1. c. 1. Therefore this power is deservedly called FULL, proper quod multum veneranda & metuenda est, wherefore it is much to be Reverenced and Feared. And indeed all Kings, Princes, Kingdoms, Churches of the World had need to fear, yea to keep watch and ward against it, and for ever to abandon it, as our and other Kings, Kingdoms, Churches have both justly and prudently done, and more are now about to do: For,Baldus.

thy feet. The two last texts pertain to Christ alone, as King of his Church. You have seen a pretty full View of Popes and their parasites blasphemous claims of an unlimited Universal Supremacy in all causes and over all persons whatsoever throughout the world, yea over the Persons, Crowns, Scepters, Kingdoms, Empires of all Kings, Princes, Emperors, vested in Christs pretended Vicar General, & S. Peters Suc∣cessors the Pope; enough to awaken, alarum all Monarchs, Realms, Churches through∣out the Universe, as well Papal as Pagan, to keep watch and ward against, and for ever to exterminate such Antichristian, Antimonarchical Usurpers out of their Domi∣nions, as all Protestant Kingdoms, Churches have done upon very good grounds, without the least guilt ofSir Roger Twisden his late learned Historical Vin∣dication of the Church of England in point of Scisme. London 1663. Schisme, wherewith they maliciously brand them: I shall now proceed to evidence the truth of my forecited Proposition, which will for ever dissipate, and overturn these their presumptuous groundlesse Claims and Titles to their forecited temporal and spiritual Universal Soveraignty. The first Part thereof; That Jesus Christ as Supream King, Lord, Head of his king∣dom the Church, whiles on earth, never claimed nor exercised any Temporal, Regal Ju∣risdiction over Kings, or other Civil Magistrates or their Subjects: much lesse deprived them of their Crowns, Kingdoms, Prerogatives; nor ever gave unto St. Peter, or to any o∣ther Apostle, the least Dominion over them, (especially such as Popes now claim) but both he and they submitted themselves to, and ratified, asserted, (not invaded) their Supremacy and Regal Power in the highest degree; I shall thus invincibly demonstrate. 1. Jesus Christ himself though (as many assert) he had a temporal right to the temporal Crown and Kingdom of the Jews, as right heir thereto of the seed of King David; and therefore was thus inquired after by the Wise men;Mat 2. 1, 2, 3. Where is He that is Born King of the Iews? Yet it is observable First, That he never claimed, nor seised on his earthly Kingdom then usurped by King Herod, who sought to mur∣der him, to secure himself against Christs Title, nor ever exercised the least Temporal, Royal Jurisdiction therein. 2ly. That (on the contrary)John 6. 15. when he perceived the peo∣ple would come and take and make him KING by force, he departed from them into a Mountain alone, to prevent their designs. 3ly. That When he was arraigned before Pilate, and accused asJoan 18. 16. c. 19. an Enemy to Caesar, because he made himself A KING; He twice openly professed in one breath; My Kingdom is not of this World, If my Kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered unto the Jews; But now is my kingdom not from hence. And in his prayer to his Father for his Disciples, (a little before his passion) he said,John 17. 16. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world: Therefore doubtlesse since, he neither challenged nor exercised any Temporal dominion as a King in his own proper King∣dom of Iudea: much lesse took he away the Diadems, Crowns, Realms, Soveraignty of any other Kings, Princes, nor exercised any Regal Jurisdiction in them.

Prudentius professed in his Hymn of Christ, sung in the very Church of Rome till this day, where he thus expostulates with Herod for fearing Christ would deprive him of his crown, and murdering the innocent children upon that very account: Herodes hostis impiè, Christum venire quid times? NON ERIPIT MORTALIA, QUI REGNA DAT COELESTIA. Why wicked Herod dost thou fear, And at Christs comming frown? The Mortal he takes not away, That gives the Heavenly crown. WhichCollect. l. 2. in Mat.

Claudian an antient Author in his Collectanea upon Matthew thus ele∣gantly seconds; That KING which is born, doth not come to overcome Kings by fighting, but to subdue them after a wonderfull manner, by dying; neither is he born to the end that he may suceed thee, but that the World may faithfully believe in him: For he is come not that he may fight being alive, but that he may triumph being slain; Nor that he may with Gold get an Army to himself out of other Nations, but that he may shed his precious bloud for the saving of the Na∣tions. Vainly didst thou by envying fear him to be thy Successor, whom by be∣lieving thou oughtest to seek as thy Saviour; because if thou didst believe in him, thou shouldest raign with him: and as thou hast received a Temporal Kingdom from him, thou shouldest also receive from him an Evelasting. For the King∣dom
of this Child is not of this World, but by him it is that men do reign in this World. He is the Wisdom of God which saith in the Proverbs, By me Kings reign. St. Augustin in his 115. Tract upon Iohn, brings in Christ making this publike proclamation; Audite ergo Judaei & Gentes: audi circumcisio; audi pra putium, audite omnia Regna terrena; non impediam Dominationem vestram in hoc mundo: Regnum meum non est de hoc mundo. Nolite metuere metu vanissimo, quo Herodes ille major cum Christus natus nunciaretur; expavit, &Ma ▪ tot infantes, ut ad eum mors perveniret occidit; timendo quam irascendo crudelior: Regnum meum (in∣quit) non est de hoc mundo.

That Christ as man whiles he lived upon earth, had neither Temporal Dominion, neither did nor would he exercise any such temporal power; I have read (saith he) the Books of the Fathers with what diligence I could, and I have often read them to deny Christ, to have a Temporal or Earthly king∣dom; but I have no where read them to affirm, that he had such a Kingdom. 1. That Christ had a Ʋniversal Kingdom of power, as he was God; 2 A Spiritual kingdom of Grace: and a third, which is an eternal Kingdom of glory, I do read; but that he had a fourth kingdom, which is properly temporal, such as other Kings here upon earth have, I find not either in the Scriptures or Fathers; yea, I esteem such a Kingdom to be con∣trary to the poverty of Christ, mentioned in the Scriptures, and to savour of the errours of the Jewes and Hereticks.De Planctu Ecclesiae lib: 1.

But their answers are so false, so absurd, I shall not spend time to refell them; but proceed. 2ly. Christ and his Apostle Saint Peter, byMat. 17. 24, 25, 26. 27. Gratian, Caus. 23, q. 8.

Cardinal Cajetan, Lucas Burgensis and others Note. Now had he been a Temporal King then and there de facto, he should have received Tribute from others, yea those who demanded it from him and Peter, not have paid it thus unto them to the prejudice of his Temporal Dominion and Kingship. Oratio .  Auxentium. St. Ambrose from this example of Christs paying Tribute, makes his inference;
Tributum petit Imperator non negamus Magnum quidem est & speciale documentum quo Christiani veri & Praelati sublimioribus potestatibus docentur debere esse subjecti; ne quis constitutionem terrenae Regis putet esse solvendam. Si enim censum Filius Dei solvit, Quis tu tantus es qui putas esse non solvendum? which he backs with Rom: 13. 1. &c. 1 Pet. 2 13.

Caus: 23. quaest. S. Ostiensis, Summa Angelica & Rosella, Johannis Langecrucius De Censibus, Talliis, Clericis, & Immuni∣tate Ecclesiae & Clericorum. Popes, Canonists, plead a general Exemption of all Prelates, Clergymen, and Religious persons from Taxes and Tributes to their Prin∣ces, contrary to the expresse precepts and presidents of Christ himself, St. Peter, St. Paul, St. Ambrose, and those two Popes constitutions, to evade this Argument of Subjection to Kings and Emperors as the Supream powers. 3ly. Christ foretold his Disciples, that they should be brought before Kings, Gover∣nors, and Councils for his sake, for a Testimony against them; and he promised, to give them in that hour, what to answer to accusers, by way of submission to their Regal power and jurisdiction; not to demurr unto it, as having no power over them, and totally exempted from their temporal Jurisdiction; (as Popes and Priests claim now.) Yea Christ himself, the very Lord of Glory;Mat. 10. 18, 19, 20. Mar: 13. 10, 11. Lu. 12. 10, 11. Acts 9. 5. submitted himself without any reluctancy or demurrer to the Jurisdiction of Pontius Pilate the Governor, who adjudged him to be crucified; Who demanding of him at his trial,John 19. 9, 10. Knowest thou not, that I have POWER to crucifie thee,Mat: 27. Mar: 15. Lu: 23. John 5. 19. and I have POWER to release thee? He answers, Thou couldest have no Power over me, unless it were given thee from above: thereby acknowledging, That his temporal power over him was vested in him by God; therefore not to be resisted, but submitted to, as Peter himself at his martyrdom. 4ly. Christ professed, Luke 12. 47.John 12. 47: Lu. 12. 13, 14. I came not to Judge the world, as a tem∣poral King or Judge: upon which account,1 Pet: 2. 9. when one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother that he may divide the inheritance with me: He said unto him, Man, who made me a judge, or divider over you? Thereby declaring, that he had no judicial, inherent temporal power over any private persons inheritance from God or Man  much lesse then over Kings and Kingdoms. 5ly. As Christ himself disclaimed all temporal Regal power and jurisdiction: so his Apostle St. Peter, (from whose pretended Primacy all Popes derive their Titles, claims both to Regal and Pontifical Jurisdiction) in his first Catholick E∣pistle to all Gods elect ones, as well Bishops, Priests, as Laymen in all the earth: After he had acquainted them with the excellency of their Christian state; that they areRev: 15. 6. c. 9. 10. c. 20. . a chosen generation, a Royal Priesthood, (and Popes pretend to no more then what every good christian, by St. Peters verdict, enjoyes in common with them) an holy Nation, a peculiar people, now the people of God, though no people before, &c. lest they should pretend an exemption thereby from all Kings and Civil Magistrates, as being as much advanced above their Jurisdiction by Pet: 2. 13, 14, 15, 16. Christs (the King of Kings) making them Kings and Priests to God his Father: (as Popes and Popish Pre∣lates pretend they are) presently subjoyns this quite contrary Practise and pe∣remptory precept;k , Subjecti estote igitur: Be ye therefore
Subiect to every Ordinance of Man, (or human creature) for the Lord, or Lords sake;  whether to the King as Supream, (Regi ut Supereminenti) as the Vulgar, Arias Montanus, and others translate it; (not to my self, as Christs supream Vicar-General, or my successors at Rome) Or unto Governors; which he backs with these invincible reasons: 1. Because they are sent by God himself, though ordained by men, as to the execution of their offices, as these next words, as those who are sent by him, (to wit, by the LORD, for whose sake you ought thus to submit unto them, as Rom: 13. 1, 2, 4, 6. and the sense resolve, not by me, or my Vicars) and that to be Supream Governors over you. 2ly. Because sent by God only, for the punishment of evil doers; as well Christi∣ans as Pagans, Popes, Priests, as Lay-christians; if you do ill, as the Gentiles accuse you to be Evil doers: v: 12. &c. 3. 16. and so subject to their Jurisdiction only, and not to mine, or your own Pastors, if proved such. 3ly. Because they are also thus sent, for the praise of them that do well; so that they by your honest conversation and good works, which they shall behold, and submission to their power and Govern∣ment; will not only praise you; but glorify God in the day of their visitation; and be∣come Christians too. 4ly. For so is the will of God, that you should thus sub∣mit to them as Supream; and with well doing put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, who falsly accuse you to pretend an exemption from all Secular power; A free, yet not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousnesse, but as the servabts of God. 5ly. He thence inferts, Honor all Men (that is, all Supream Governours) to whom Honor is due, Rom: 13. 7. Fear God, Honor the King, in a more signal manner, as Su∣pream, and Gods Vice-Roy upon Earth; the honoring of whom for the Lords sake, will evidence to the world and your own consciences that you fear God; when your disobedience to, exempting your selves from, and advancing your selves above them, will discover, that youProv: 24: 21, 22.

Innocent the 3d. with other Popes and theirAlvarus Pela∣gius de Plan Eccles. lib. 1. Art: 31. &c. Parasites, to evade Saint Peters text, assert; 1. That it extends only to those who receive temporal things from the Emperor, who in temporal things is Supream (which yet he and his Successors elsewhere contradict) but not to spiritual things, wherein Pontifex antecellit, which excell temporal things, as much as the soul doth the body. 2ly. That it is not said sim∣pliciter, Subjecti estote; but with this addition, propter Deum; which extenuates and qualifies it. 3ly. Neither is it purely written Regi praecellenti, sed interpositum Forsttan, non sine causa. 4ly. Ad vindictam malefactorum extends only to those, qui utentes gladio ejus sunt Jurisdictioni subjecti: not to Priests, whose Promotion of Priesthood advanceth them above Kings and kingdoms,Jer. 1. totally to root up and to destroy, and to build and plant them. To which evasions I answer: 1. That St. Peter makes no such distinction of Tem∣poralties and Spiritualties; nor that the King or Emperor is supream in the one, but himself, Popes, Prelates only in the other, as this Pope doth. 2ly. He ac∣knowledgeth the King Supream in both, it being Heresy (as they assert) toHere p. . hold two Supream heads, and two Principles of power in and over one body. 3ly. Peter writes this Epistle to all the Elect Saints, as1 Pet▪ 2. 5. to 14. Gods peculiar people, heritage, a Royal, holy Priesthood, and an holy Church, Nation unto God; enjoyning them upon this con∣sideration only, not as meer worldlings, to submit to Kings and Governors as Supream, without one word of his own, his Successots, or others supremacy over them: there∣fore it extends to spiritual as well as to temporal Supremacy. 4ly. This Pope ac∣knowledgeth the Emperor to be Supream in Temporal things, which he bestowes on o∣thers, who receive them. But Popes (asGatian Dist: 96. Alvarus Pelagius, lib. . Artic. 37. Eu∣gubinus Steu∣chus de . Constantini; See Dr. Cra∣kenthorps De∣fence of Con∣stantine, cap. 7, . &c. themselves and flatterers confesse) have received all their temporalties, and St. Peters Patrimony from the Gifts of Emperors, as Constantine, Charles the Great, and others: Therefore they ought to acknow∣ledge him Supream in temporal things at least, notwithstanding all their recited vaunts and passages denying it. 5ly. St. Peter and Bishops had thenActs 3. 3. to 19. Bernard de Consideratione ad Eugenim, lib. 2. & 3. neither Silver, gold, nor temporal possessions at all, nor yet those Strangers scattered by per∣secutions through Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphilia, to whom he writes; who all sold their possessions, and were spoyled of their goods, when he sent this Epistle to them. Therefore Saint Peter rather intended Kings and Governours to be supream in ecclesiastical matters, in1 Pet. 1. 1▪ 7, 8. c▪ 23. 16, 17. Acts 2. 44, 45. c. 4. 34, to the end, c. 5, 10. Hebr. 10. 32, 33, 34. 1 Thess. 2. 14. 15. rewarding; praysing and encouraging them in good
works, and in a Christian, honest, pious conversation, and punishing them for sins con∣trary to and scandalizing their Christian profession; then for temporal matters 2ly. His 2d. evasion doth not deny, nor diminish, but fortifie Kings Supremacy: For if he had commanded them to submit to Kings and Governors as supream by the bare Ordinance of men alone, this had been no strong obligation in point of con∣science to them; but when he adds for the Lords sake: this superadds divine authority to this humane Ordinance, and binds them in point of conscience to∣wards God, and as they are Christians to this submission to them.Antiqu. Ju∣daeorum, l. 17▪ c. 3. & lib. 18. c. 1. 2. Josephus re∣lates that in his time (not long before this Epistle written) there rose up a crafty arrogant sect of the Pharisees; et interdum Regibus quoque infestum; ut eos etiam aperte oppugnare non verentur; necnon cum tota gens Judeorum fidem suam jure∣jurando obligasset Regi et Caesari, hi solum non iuraverunt, being above six thousand men in number, hoc nomine à Rege mulctatis: and pretending to know se∣crets by divine Revelations, they openly proclaimed (like some of our late Re∣publicans and Fanaticks, in relation to the King and his Royal family) Decretum esse a Deo regnum ablatum ab Herode et eius progenie transferre ad Phe∣ronem, uxorem ejus & communes liberos: And they with others held, That being Abra∣hams seed, and Gods people they ought not to be in subjection or pay Tribute to the Roman Emperor and Pagan Kings: Hereupon the Jewish and other Christians were then suspected, accused to beTertulliani Apologia & ad Scapulam, lib. enemies to Kings, and Cesar; yea to deny subjection, tribute and an Oath of Allegiance to them as supream chief Governours, as these Pharisees did. To take off this slander, Saint Peter (and Paul too) did in their Epistles, as well as Sermons, most earnestly and particularly presse Christians subjection, obedience to Emperors; Kings, Princes, and all Secular powers, even for the Lords and conscience sake, as ordained and sent by God himself, and a duty enjoyned them by the ve∣ry Will and Gospel of God; as Chrysostom, Haymo, Soto, Calvin, Gualther, Willet, Pareus, Perrerius, most other Commentators on the place, and Bellarmine himself ac∣knowledge. To which Doctrine, practise, nothing could have been more diametri∣cally contrary, then to set up such a Universal Temporal Monarchy and Ecclesiastical Supremacy in Peter, and his pretended Successors in the See of Rome it self (then the seat of the Roman Emperors) as they now pretend to, inconsistent with the Empe∣rors Supremacy, and all Kings Government, Regal power, here knocked down and crushed in the shell by St. Peters own hand, keyes, and sacred pen. This Pope his 3d evasion is most absurd: For had it been Submit your selves therefore Regi praecellenti, as this Innocent would have Peter vary it, it would have extended only to one King a∣lone, then most eminent, or to Christ; whereas now it relates to all Kings and Gover∣nours too, who have Regal, or supream Authority: and the addition after it, as Su∣pream, is so far from extenuating the Kings Supremacy, that it more fully, emphatical∣ly asserts it: not with a forsitan, as he mistakes, (which would have made the Suprema∣cy disputable) but with a quasi, or sicut supereminenti; which puts it out of question; like that of Rom. 1. 21. Because when they knew God they glorified him not sicut Deus, as God: which last clause, as God, adds lustre, yea Divine Glory to his Deity, which it identically not comparatively sets forth and asserts. His 4th. evasion, that this precept extends only to Lay-christians,Gratian Di∣stinct. 31. caus. 11. qu. 2. Here p. 37. as to Kings and Governours civil power, not to Bishops, Priests, especially to Popes, (exempt from, above all human judicature) is most false. For this Epistle is general to all the elect of God, to whom he directs it; whereof some no doubt were Elders, and Ministers of the Church, as himself informs us, c. 5. 1, 2, 3. 2ly. He gives this command in precise terms,1 Pet: 1. 1, 2. To all who came unto Christ the living and precious stone, and were built up on him (not Peter)2 Pet: 2, 4, 5. as lively stones, a spiritual house, an Holy and Royal Priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacri∣fices unto God. I hope Popes, Popish Prelates and Masse-priests dare not assert, that Lay-Christians only are this Holy and Royal Priesthood; since they whollySee Bellar∣min. & others De Clericis & Sacerdotio. Gratian Di∣stinctio 22, 96. appro∣priate it to themselves, as no wayes belonging to the Laity, (though St. Peter equal∣ly extends it to both, without distinction:) Therefore this precept most belongs to them. 4ly. They of all others haveSee Philip Morney his My∣sterium Iniquitatis; Centuriae Magd: 5. to 13. and my Antipathy of the Lordly Prelacy to Unity and Monarchy. in all ages most invaded, oppugned the tem∣poral, magistratical Supremacy of Kings and Emperors: Therefore they were princi∣pally intended by Saint Peter, who would not presse that submission only on the Laity, from which himself, all Bishops and Clergymen (their guides and presidents
of obedience) were totally exempted. 3dly. St. Peter makes no such distinction as Popes now do, between Lay-Christians and Clergy-men, (yea he defines those now stiled the Laity to be Cleri, the Lords Clergy or Heritage, 1 Pet: 5. 3. not the El∣ders) nor between himself, Popes, Prelates, and other Presbyters, as Popes and o∣thers since make: yea, such a distinction would have not only verified, but aggravated the calumnies, accusations of the Pagans against the Christians; For had he informed those to whom he writes, and the Roman Pagan Emperors, Kings, Governors then ruling, that all Lay Christians ought to be subject to them as Supream in all temporal things held of them; but that himself, and all Christian Bishops, Elders, Ministers were totally exempted from their power, and had the sole Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction originally in themselves; by virtue whereof they could root up and pull down, build up and plant them, their Empires, Kingdoms, Nations, at their pleasures; and were set over them for that very purpose, as Jeremiah was, in this Popes sence, not Gods. This certainly would have incensed all Emperors, Kings, and Governours against them, to their total and final extirpation, as the archest Traytors, Rebels, that ever the world produced. This Popes distinction therefore, was as farr from St. Peters mea∣ning, as he was from his humility. 6ly. St. Peter in this very Epistle, as he stiles himself only,1 Pet. 5. , 2, 3, 4. an Elder; yea fellow Elder (not Christs Vicar, Viceroy, Head of his Church &c. as Popes since have done) so he exhorts the Elders of the Church only as his fellows, (not commands them as their Lord) to feed the flock of Christ which is amongst them; neither as being Lords over Gods heritage, (as Popes now make themselves) but being ensamples to the flock. Therefore those Kings and Governors to whom he enjoyned them to submit themselves (not Peter, nor these Elders) as Supream, were Supream over them in all temporal and ecclesiastical Causes, as well as over their flocks, to whom they were to be examples herein as well as in other particu∣lars. 7ly.De Romano Pontifice l. 2. Amesii Bellar∣minus Enerva∣tus, Tom. 3. p. 175, 176. Bellarmin affirms Saint Peters first Universal Epistle to be written from Rome, from this salutation in the cloze thereof;1 Pet: 1. 13. The Church which is at Babylon saluteth you; affirming this Babylon to be Rome, to prove Peters being Bishop thereof, and his Universal Supremacy, as Christs Vicar, since devolved unto Popes; Wherein he makes the Church of Rome a true Antichristian Babylon, and mother of confusion, in perverting this Epistle from Rome, so pregnant for the Temporal and Ecclesiastical Supre∣macy of Kings and Temporal Magistrates over all their Christian subjects, as well of the Clergy, as Laity, so far, as to give the Pope an absolute Supremacy over Kings and Emperors themselves, which never entred into St. Peters heart, nor was ever claimed or exercised, but abominated by him, and thus Decreed against in his unerring chair.

Saint Peter in his second Ʋniversal Epistle, chap: 2. gives a most lively cha∣racter of Popes Apostacy, ambition, covetousnesse, uncleannesse, injustice and pre∣sumption; more especially in despising all Dominion over them by Emperors, Kings, and Magistrates, in speaking evil of Dignities, without fear of God or Man, in defiance of his first Epistle, and bringing many railing accusations against them; (as they do in their Epistles, Decrees, Bulls, Books against their Supremacies) whereas Angels who are greater in power and might, dare not do it.

St. Paul (the first real Apostle, and sole Bishop of Rome,In Rom. 13. to whom he only writ (if any Apostle was so) at least joynt Bishop with Peter (if ever Bishop there)
asContra Hae∣reses, lib. 1. Her. 27. col. 88, 89. Epiphanius,Eccles. Hist. l. 3. c. 31. Eusebius, and others attest) even in his very Epistle to the Saints and Church of Rome it self, hath put in an eternal Bar against the pretended Supremacy of Popes, as St. Peter did (in his Epistles from it) Rom: 13. 1, to 3. where he gives a universal precept to all present and future Saints and Members of the Roman Church (as well Popes, Prelates, Priests, and other Ecclesiasticks, as Lay-Christians or Pa∣gans, as theChrysostom Homil. 23: in Rom. 13. Th∣odoret, Theodu∣lus, Occumeni∣nius, Sedulius, Theophilact in Rom. 13▪ Fathers resolve) Let every Soul be subiect to the higher Powers (not to Paul or Peter, who enjoyn obedience to them) acknowledged by all to be the Roman Emperors, Senate, though then meer Pagans; not abolished nor translated to Peter, by Christ himself; and that upon these unanswerable reasons: 1. Because there is no power but of God. 2ly. The power that are (then in being, and so not aboli∣shed by Christ, but ratified) are ordained and ordered by God. 3ly. Whosoever therefore resisteth (much more then who usurp, abolish, as Popes and their Parasites do) the power, resisteth the Ordinance of God. 4ly. Those that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation; not a Papal canonization. 5ly. For rulers are not a terrour to good works, but to evill. 6ly. Those that do good, need not fear the Power, yea they shall have praise and rewards, as well as protection from the same. 7ly. For he is the minister of God to thee for good. 8ly. But if thou do that which is evil, He (not the Pope) bea∣reth not the sword (of Justice) in vain, for he is the Minister of God, a Revenger (in God stead) to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. 9ly. (From all these premises he drawes this peremptory conclusion,) Wherefore ye must needs be subiect not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. 10ly. For, for this cause pay you tribute also, for they (not Bishops or Priests) are Gods (not Saint Peters, or the Popes) Ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. 11ly. From all which he thus concludes, Render therefore to All (Higher powers that are) their Dues, (by Divine, Evangelical right) Tribute to whom Tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor, (in the affirmative:) Owe nothing to any man (in power, as well as out) but to love one another: obeying them out of love, not fear. What now is become of St. Peters, or his pretended successors Monarchy, Headship over the Church, or Emperor of Rome himself, which St. Pauls sword hath for ever decapitated? Yet some Popes and theirAlvarus Pe∣lagius de Plan∣ctu Eccles. lib. 1. Art. 37.

Theodoret Bishop of Cyprus thus expounds this Text; Let every Soul be subject to the higher powers, whether he be any Priest or my Bishop, (then certainly any Pope or Popish Prelate) or any Monk; he must yeeld sub∣iection to those to whom Magistracy is given.Comment. in Rom. 13. Theodulus Bishop of Caelosy∣ria concurs with him upon this reason; For that the Gospel was not given for the sub∣version of the publike Civil Government and order.In cap. 13. ad Romanos. St. Chrysostom Patriarch of Constantinople (Romes and Popes Corrivals for precedency) goes one step higher in his Exposition of this Text; For All, whether thou be a Priest, or a Prophet, or an Apostle (therefore a Pope, or a Monk, which his next words certainly include) or whosoever else thou be, every one is commanded to obey these Higher Powers.

Peter Mar∣tyr, Paraeus and others in locum Theophylact, and sundry others conclude against these Papal Impostors, and praevaricators of this unanswerable Text for Regal Supremacy. 8ly. To put this out of doubt, the same St. Paul in his First Epistle to Timo∣thy (whom Popes and allEspenceus, Bishop Hall, Bishop Bilson, Bp. Downham, and others. My Vnbishop∣ping of Timo∣thy and Titus. Prelates assert to be the first and sole Bishop of Ephesus) 1 Tim: 2. 1, 2, 3. exhorts him, that First of all supplications, prayers, intercessions and giving of thanks should be made For Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that We (including himself and Timothy as well as other Christians) may lead a quiet and peace∣able

But these Transcendent Blasphemies, and even Atheistical Delusions will satisfie no sober Christians conscience, nor yet evade these and St. Peters own forecited Texts, Precepts; which the Pope cannot dispense with, unlesse he will make the Servant above; greater then his Lord,John 13. 16. c. 15. 20. and the Vicar then the Master. 9ly.Mat. 15. 4▪ 5, 6. Mar. 7. 10, 11, 12. Christ himself, together with Paul and Peter, do from the 5th Com∣mandement most frequently presse and inculcate allEph. 5 22, 2, 24. c. 6. 1, to 10. Col. 2. 18, to 25. 1 Tim. 6 1, 2. due subjection and obedience by Wives unto their Husbands, Children to their Parents, and Servants to their Masters in all things, and that with fear and trembling, in singlenesse of heart as unto Christ; not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, and with good will doing them service, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that of the LORD they shall receive the Inheritance; for (herein) they serve the Lord Christ. Therefore there is the self-same relation, obedience due to Kings and Magistrates, (the politick Husbands, Parents, Masters of the Realm, people,) by all Members of the body politick, as there is by Wives, children, servants, to their Hus∣bands, Parents, Masters. 10thly. It is very observable that Christ himself, with his Apostles Peter and Paul do in the New Testament more frequently, punctually, energetically inculcate this duty of1. Pet. 2. 18, 1 c 3. 1, 2, 3. subjection, obedience, honor, paying Tribute to Emperors, Kings, and Civil Magistrates (though then all Pagans, unbelievers) yea for all Wives, Children, Ser∣vants to obey, fear, and reverence their Husbands, Parents, Masters in the flesh; on all sorts of Christians, under the Gospel, then ever they were urged or reiterated in the Old Testament before or under the Law; and that for these ends and upon these ac∣counts, as I humbly apprehend; First, to evidence, That all Kings, Supream Civil Ma∣gistrates, Parents under the Gospel enjoy the selfsame Soveraign Jurisdiction over all Civil, Ecclesiastical persons, things, and their children under the Gospel, as they did be∣fore or under the Law in the Old Testament; and that the Kingship, Kingdom of Christ under the Gospel did no wayes diminish nor eclipse (much lesse abolish; or transfer to Apostles, Bishops, Presbyters, or Chapters) any part of their antient Temporal or Spiritual Authority before and under the Law. 2ly. To make the freeRom. 13. 1, t . 1 Tim. 2. 1 2, 3. passage for the preaching and reception of the Gospel among all Nations, Kingdoms, Re∣publikes in the world, as consistent with, and no wayes opposing, but advancing, ra∣rifying their respective Civil Governments, by prescribing every soul to yeeld all chearfull obedience, subjection to their Civil Governors, Lawes, for the peace and tranquility of their Kingdoms. 3ly. To stop the mouthes of Pagans and all
Enemies of Christian Religion, and Christians,1 Pet. 2. 12, to 17. c. 3. 16 Tertull: Apol. Athenagoras apologia pro Christianis. who traduced and accused them as op∣posites and Enemies to, & rebels against Emperors, Kings, Magistrates, their Government and Lawes. 4ly. To take away all pretences from1 Pet. 2. 16. Libertins and yoaklesse Chri∣stians, under pretext of Christian Liberty, and the priviledges of Christianity to diso∣bey contemn all Kings, Magistrates Lawes and Civil Government, as exempted from their power. 5ly. To lessen and controll the Antichristian Usurpations of the Popes, Prelates, Clergy ofRom. 13. 1, to 10. Rome it self, and their Confederates elsewhere, upon the Crownes, prerogatives, rights and kingdoms of Christian Kings and Emperors which should embrace the Gospel: All which reasons are expressed or intimated in the Gospel it self, Pauls Epistle to the Romans, and St Peters. 11ly. St Paul in his second Epistle to Timothy (a Bishop, as all Popes, Bishops assert) in relation to his spiritual warfare, layes down this universal Maxim, which every good Souldier of Jesus Christ must observe,2 Tim. 2. 3, 4. No man that warreth intangleth himself with the Affairs of this Life, that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a Soldier. If then no Bishop or good Spiritual Souldier of Jesus Christ, must so much as once entangle themselves with the affairs of this world and life, that so they may discharge their duties, as to please Christ, who hath chosen them to be his souldiers: then certainly neither Christ nor his Apostles ever gave or com∣mitted to any Apostle, Pope, Bishop, or Minister of the Gospel, any Supreme Tem∣poral Jurisdiction, over all or any Kings, Kingdoms or Civil Corporations in the world,Rom. 13. 6. which require continual attendance, and would totallyActs 6. 2, &c. avocate them from their spiritual warfare. 12ly. The Apostles themselves (though inspired from Heaven what to preach, without much study) when there was a complaint made to them,Acts 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. that the widows and poor were neglected in the daily ministration, calling all the multitude of Disciples to them, sayd, It is not Reason that we should leave the World of God and serve Tables; wherefore Brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost, and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this businesse: But we will give our selves continually unto the Ministry of the World: And the saying pleased the whole multitude, who thereupon chose Stephen and 6. more Deacons to attend the poor: whereupon the word of God increased, & the number of Disciples multiplyed in Jerusalem greatly. If the Apostles then thought it against reason, that they should once or twice a day serve Tables, and the poor, (though an act of charity and piety) as be∣ing inconsistent with their Apostolical Office, Ministry; and thereupon ordained Deacons to discharge the trust: Then certainly it cannot but be against Reason and Scripture to assert, That Christ gave, or any of his Apostles by divine right and insti∣tution ever had, claimed, exercised, or ought to enjoy any the least Temporal Jurisdi∣ction or Dominion in the world; much lesse such as Popes pretend to from St. Pe∣ter, who was present at, and assenting to this institution of Deacons: it being whol∣ly inconsistent with their Spiritual function. 13ly. Christ himself assured his Apostles,Mat. 6. 4. Lu. 10. 13. 1 John 2. 15. That no man can serve two Masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to the one and despise the other; Ye cannot serve God and Mammon: Therefore, when Christ called his Disciples to follow him,Mat. 11. 27. Mar. 1. 18. Lu. 5. 11. they forsook their worldly imployments and all they enjoyed, that they might apply themselves wholly to their Apostolical and Ministerial functi∣ons: And when He called Barnabas and Paul to be Apostles, he said,Acts 13. 2. Sepa∣rate me Barnabas and Paul to the work I have appointed them. Which Paul thus ex∣presseth; Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ, called to be an Apostle,Rom: 1. 1. Separate unto the Gospel of Jesus Christ; being wholly taken off from all secular imployments as incompatible with their Apostolical Function. Upon which Account he giveth this charge to all other Ministers;Rom: 12. 6, 7, 8. He that hath the gift of the ministry, let him wait on the ministry;Gratian caus. 21. qu. 3. Summa Angeli∣c. Clericus 9. and he that teacheth in teaching, and he that exhorteth on exhortation; He that ruleth (as a Magistrate) let him do it with diligence. Whence sundry Fa∣thers, Councils, Popes Decretals, Canonists, Schoolmen, have prohibited all Bishops, Priests and Clergymen to intermeddle as Judges, Advocates, Proctors or Sollicitors, in any secular affairs; asGul. Nubri∣gensis, hist. l. 4. c. 4. Antiqu. Eccles. Brit. p. 140, 141. inconsistent with their spiritual function under pain of depriva∣tion; Therefore it is most certain, That Christ never gave to Peter, or any other A∣postle, Bishop, Minister, any Temporal Jurisdiction over Kings, kingdoms, or in temporal affairs, being diametrically contrary to and inconsistent with their spiri∣tual vocations.
14ly. St. Paul chargeth Timothy (a Bishop, as Bishops assert)1 Tim. 4. 13, 14, 15. To give him∣self wholly to reading, exhortation and doctrine, that his profiting might appear before all men: and give him, with all other Bishops, Presbyters, and Ministers of the Gos∣pel this dreadfull charge;2 Tim. 4. 1, 2 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom: Preach the word, be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering & doctrine; denouncing a Wo1 Cor. 9. 16, 17 to himself if he preach not the Gospel; which he thereupon preached constanly,Acts 19. 8, 9, 10. c. 20. 20, 31. c. 28. 30, 31. Rom. 15. 19, 20 publikely, and from house to house, asLu: 21. 37, 38. John 8. 1. 2: Acts 2. 48. c. 4. 31. c. 5. 41. Christ and his Apostles daily preached it; whose1 John 2. 6. Phil: 3. 17. Col. 4. 17. examples all Bishops, Popes, Ministers ought to follow. Now this they could not possibly do, had they all Temporal and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction de∣legated to them, the execution whereof wouldSee Matt. Parker Antiqu. Eccles. Brit: p. 138, to 142. in Vita Huberti. Bernard. de Consid. l. 1. & 3. totally divert, or very much inter∣rupt them in their ministerial Office, preaching, instructing the people, and other duties of their Ministry. Therefore it is infallible, Christ never gave to any of them any tem∣poral Jurisdiction. 15ly. St. Paul blaming the1 Cor: 6. 3, 4, 5, 6. Christians of the Church of Corinth, for going to Law with their brethren before Pagan Judges, to the scandal of christianity, doth not dele∣gate the hearing and decision of such controversies to the Bishops or Elders of the Church; but adviseth them, To set them to Judge who are least esteemed in the Church; as no wayes fit for the Bishops and Pastors thereof: Therefore they neither had, nor ought to have any Temporal Jurisdiction. 16ly. St. Paul makes this the special badge and character of Antichrist, that man of sinne, and sonne of perdition,2 Thess. 2, 3, to 1. that he opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, (to wit, over all Kings and secular Magistrates, stiledExod: 4. 16▪ Psal: 82. 1. 6. Gods in the Old Testament) or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. And St.Rev: 13. John describes him under the Notion of a bast, exercising temporal Jurisdiction in the Church and State, causing all, both great and small, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or foreheads; and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark: and that he had power given him over all Kingdoms, Tongues and Nations; (which Popes now claim) so that all that dwelt on the earth worshipped him, whose names were not written in the Lambs book. And he further subjoyns,Rev. 17. 12, That the ten horns he saw, were ten Kings, who receive power as Kings, one honour with the beast, who have one mind, and shall give their (Kingly) Power and Strength unto the Beast: that so by pretext thereof, he may claim and exercise both civil and ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, as Popes do now by pretext ofGratian, dist. 96.

Upon which ac∣count mostAbbot, Powel, Squire, Dr. Beard, De An∣tichristo, Phil. Morney Myste∣rium Iniquita∣tis. Protestant (and some Romish Divines) assert, Popes claiming exercising both the supream temporal and ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, over Kings, Emperors, Kingdoms, Churches, to be the ANTICHRIST. And if so, Then that Jurisdiction which is thus declared to be Antichristian, neither did of right belong to Christ, nor was ever delegated by him to St. Peter, or the Bishops of Rome, or any other Bishops whatsoever, being diametrically contrary to Christ and Christianity. 17ly. Christ himself as he did with some indignation refuse to be a voluntary Judge or Arbitrator in a small temporal inheritance, to divide it between two breth∣ren when required; saying,Lu. 12. 13, 14. Man, who made me a Iudge, or a Divider over you? nei∣ther God, nor Man the Supream Magistrate having given him any such Commission: So he hath in precise terms expresly prohibited all Kingly and Lordly Dominion to his Apostles, and in them to all Popes, Prelates, Bishops and Ministers whatsoever; Mat. 20. 25, 26. Luke 22. 25, 26. And he said unto them,See Alvarus Pelagius lib. 2. Artic. 57. where he objects this & the premised Texts, & re∣turns most piti∣full answers  them. The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship over them, and they that exercise Authority upon them, are called Benefactors, (or Gracious Lords, as the old Translations render it) But ye shall not be so, (or it shall not be so) among you: but he that is or will be Great (or Greatest) among you, let him be your Minister, and whosoever will be Chief among you, let him be your Servant.

At si interdictum tenemus, audiamus Edictum: Qui major est vestrum, ait, fiat sicut minor, & qui praecelsior est, sicut qui ministrat: Forma Apostolica haec est: Dominatio interdicitur, indicitur ministratio: quae et Commendatur ipsius exemplo legistatoris, qui secutus adjungit; Ego autem in medio vestrum sum,2 Cor. 11. 13▪ tanquam qui ministrat. Quis se jam Titulo hoc inglorium putet, quo se prior dominus Gloriae Praesignivit? Merito, Paulus Gloriatur in eo dicens: Ministri Christi sunt? Et ego: & addit, ut minus sa∣piens dico, plus ego, in laboribus plurimus, in carceribus abundantius, in plagis supra modum, in mortibus frequenter. O Praeclarum Ministerium! quo nonid gloriosius principatu?Gal. 6. 14. Si gloriari oportet, forma tibi sanctorum praesigitur, Apostolorum proponitur gloria. Parvane tibi illa videtur? quis mihi tribuat similem fieri in gloria Sanctorum? Clamat Apostolus, Mihi autem absit gloriari, nisi in cruce Domini nostri Jesu Christi: Hoc Glorieris opto semper optimo genere Gloriae, quod Apostoli, quod Prophetae delegere sibi, transmisere tibi. Agnosce haereditatem tuam in Christi cruce, in laboribus pluri∣mis. Felix qui dicere potuit, Plus omnibus laboravi. He thus further disproves the Popes right to intermeddle with, judge or determine any temporal causes, or to u∣surp the Scepters, Crowns, possessions of the world, or earthly kingdoms: De Conside∣ratione, lib. 1.

Sed non est comparatio: Habent haec infima & terrena Iudices suos, Reges et Principes terrae: Quid fines alienos invaditis: Quid falcem vestram in alienam messem extenditis? Non quia indigni vos, sed quia indignum vobis talibus isistere, quippe po∣tioribus ocupatis, &c. Itaque haec & innumera talia dixerem, si fortia dic rem, si re∣cta, si sincera.

He proceeds thus most elegantly and pithily in answering the Popes pretences to the Monarchy and Possessions of all the world, as Successor to the Aposties in their pretended Universal Principality.4 De Conside∣ratione, l. 3. c. 1, 3, 4 Nimis comfortatus est Principatus eorum; consti∣tuti sunt Principes super omnem terram (only in preaching the Gospel to all Nati∣ons, as he proves from Psal. 19.)Ps. 45, & 138. Eis tu successisti in hareditatem; ita tuhaeres, et orbis haereditas. At quatinus haec portio te contingit, aut contigerit illos, id sobria con∣sideratione pensandum; Non enim per omnem reor modum. Ut michi videtur, dispen∣satio tibi super illum credita, non data possessio. Si pergis usurpare et hanc,Psal: 49. contradicit tibi qui dicit, Meus est orbis terrae, & plenitudo ejus. Num tu ille de quo Propheta; Et erit omnis terra possessio ejus? Christus hic est, qui possessionem sibi vendicat, et jure Creationis, et merito Redemptionis,Psal. . et Dono Patris; Cui enim alteri dictum est, Postula a me, & dabo tibi Gentes haereditatem, & possessionem tuam terminus terrae. Pos∣sessionem et Dominium cede huic, tu curam illius habe: Pars tua haec, ultra ne extendas manum. Quid inquis? Non negas praeesse, et Dominari vetas? Plane sic. Quasi non bene praesit, qui praeest in sollicitudine: nunquid non et villa villico, et parvus Dominus subjectus est paedagogo? Nec tamen villae ille, nec ille sui Domini Dominus est. Ita et tu, praesis, ut provideas, ut consulas, ut pro∣cures, Mat. 2. ut serves. Praesis et prosis; praesis ut fideles servus et prudens, quem constituit Dominus super familiam suam; Ad quid, ut des illis es∣cam in tempore: Hoc est, ut dispenses, non imperes. Hoc fac, Dominari ne affectes hominum homo, ut non dominetur tibi omnis iniustitia. At satis superque id intimatum supra, cum quis sis disutaretur. Addo tamen et hoc Nullum tibi venenum, mullum gladium plus formido, quam libidinem dominandi. Certe multum tibi tribuas, si mul∣tum deceptus non es,Rom. 1. nil te existimas plus his accepisse a ma∣gnis Apostolis. Recordare nunc vocis illius; Sapientibus et insipientibus debitor sum. Eti non indebitam tibi ipsam censes, hoc quoque simul memento, debitoris mo∣lestum nomen,Luke 1. servienti potius quam Dominanti congruere. Servus in Evan∣gelio, audit; Quantum debes Domino meo? Frgo site agnoscis sapientibus & insipi∣pientibus non dominatorem sed debitorem, curandum summopere tibi & tota vi∣gilantia considerandum, quomodo & qui non sapiunt sapiant, qui sapiant non desipiant, & qui desipiere, resipiscant, &c. After which, he concludes with this pathetical Excla∣mation, and interrogation. O ambitio ambientium Crur, quomodo om∣nes torquens omnibus places? Nil acerbius cruci, at nil molestius inquietat, nil tamen apud miseros mortales celebrius negotiis ejus. An non limina Apostolorum plus jam ambitio quam devotio terit? An non vocibus ejus vestrum tota die resultat palatium? An non questibus ejus tota Legum Ca∣nonumque disciplina insudat? An non spoliis ejus omnis Italica in∣hiat inerplebili aviditate rapacitas? Quid ita tua spiritualia studia
non saltem intercidir, sed occidit. Quoties sancta ac facunda tua abortori ocia fecit inquietum et inquietans malum? Aliud est quod ab oppressis appellatur ad te: aliud autem quod Ambitie in Ecclesia per te regnare molitur. Nec deesse illis, nec huic aliquatinus assenrire o∣portet. He concludes thus to our purpose: after a large detection of and invective against the monstrous ambition, rapine, injustice of the Parasites, Officers, and Ministers of the Court of Rome, he falls upon the more then Regal and Imperial wordly pomp of the Pope himself;De Consid∣ratione, l. 4. Inter haec tu Pastor procedis deauratus, tam multa circumdarus varietate. Oves quid rapiunt? Si auderem dicere, Demonum magis quam ovium pascua haec, Scilicet Sic factitabat Petrus? sic Paulus ? Vides omnem Ecclesiasticum zelum fervere so∣la pra Dignitate tuenda; Honori totum datur, sanctitati nihil, aut parum. Si causa requirent; paulo ummissius agere, ac socialius te habere temperaveris; Absit inquiunt,Nota. non decet, tempore non congruit, majestati, non convenit, quam geris personam attendito. De placito Dei ultima mentio, est pro jactura salutis nulla cunctatio, Nisi quod sublime est, salutare dicamus, et quod gloriam redolet, id justum. Ita omne humite probro ucitur inter Palatinos, ut facilius qui esse, quam qui apparere humilis velit invenias. Timor Dei, simplicitas reputatur, de dicam ftuitas, &c. Hic, hic non parco tibi, ut pareat Deus. Pastorem te populo huic cè aut nega aut exhibe. Non negabis, ne cujus sedem tenes, te neget heredem: Petrus hic est, qui nescirur processisse aliquando vel gemmis ornatus vel seicis; non tectus auro, non vectus equo albo, nec stirpatus milite, nec circumstrepentibus septus ministris.John 21. Absque his tamen credidit satis posse impleri salutare mandatum, Si amas me, pasce oves meas. In his successisti non Petro, sed Constantino. Thus this Canonized Ro∣man Saint, Bernard, concluded long since against the Popes pretended Monarchy to Pope Eugenius himself, with whom I shall cloze this branch of my 4. Proposition. For the second part thereof; That Jesus Christ as Supream King of his kingdom, the Church-militant upon earth, never delegated the Soveraign Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over it, or all the Members in it, to St. Peter, or any other Apostle, Bishop, Priest or Pope whatsoever, as his Viceroyes; but only the ministerial part of his Prophetical (not Kingly or High Priests) office of teaching and preaching the Gospel publikely to all Nations, administring the Sacraments of Baptism, & Lords Supper according to his institution and command; feeding them as his sheep with the sincere milk of his word, teaching them (as his Apostles, Ministers, Servants) to obey what he hath commanded them; beeeching them as his Embassadors in his stead to be reconciled to God; and to de∣clare, pronounce them absolved from their sins by God, upon their sincere repentance, and to aenounce damnation against them, if they do not repent and believe in Christ. I shall demonstrate the verity thereof: First, from the several Commissions, or Precepts: 2dly. From the respective Titles given by Christ and the Gospel to the Apostles, Peter, Bishops, Presbyters, Ministers and their respective Offices, in and as they relate to the Kingdom, Church and people of God. 1. For their respective Commissions, I shall enumerate and examine them di∣stinctly.Mat. 10. 1, to 16. Mar: 3. 14. to 20. Lu. 9. 1, to 16. compared with c. 10. 1, to 14. The first Commission given them by Christ, was only toMat: 28. 19, 20▪ preach the Gospel and Kingdom of Heaven to the lost sheep of the House of Israel, but not to the Samaritans and Gentiles; without any Jurisdiction or pomp; without scr, gold, silver, or brasse in their purses, two coats, or staves; only as labourers worthy of their hire, or meat, which they were to receive from those to whom they preached: Which commission imports nothing of Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in it, expiring before Christs passion, then head on earth of his Church, and equal to all the Apostles; not peculiar to St. Peter. The second general Grand Commission given them by Christ (wherein their of∣fice principally consists) after his Resurrection, is thus recorded by St.Ma: 16. 16, 17, 1. Matthew, and (d) Mark: Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every Creature: He that
believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned; Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost; Teaching them to observe whatsoever I have commanded you; (not what your selves without my command, much lesse Popes, Priests, Prelates shall of their own heads prescribe) That this was their principal commission, charge, office; is further evidencedActs 2. 4. 42, 46, 47. c. 3. c.  1, 2, 18, 19, 33, c. 5. 28, 29, 42. c. 19. 8, 9, 10. c. 20. 20, 31, c. 28. 30, 31. Col. 1. 5, 6, 23 Rom 10. 18. c. 15. 19, 20. by the Apostles daily constant preaching to the people, both in the Temple, Synagogues, and from house to house, notwithstanding the High Priests and Councels inhibitions not to preach; chusing rather to obey God then men: By St. Pauls separation and mission to preach the Gospel; the necessity laid upon him, and1 Cor: 9. 14. to 24. Rom. 1. 1, 2. Gal. 1. 16 Eph: 3. 8. 2. Cor 10. 14, 16. 1 Thess. 2. 9. Act. 20. 20. c. 28. 30, 31. wo that would fall on him, if he did not preach it; And his dreadfull charge to Timothy, (and in him to all Bishops and Ministers of the Gospel)2 Tim: 4. 1, 2. I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge both the quick and dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the Word; be instant in season, out of season, re∣buke, reprove, (in and by the word preached) exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine. In all this Grand commission, there is only a Ministration, not the least Domination or Iurisdiction delegated to Peter, or any other Apostle, Evangelist, Bishop, Priest, or Minister whatsoever: Yea, it is observable, That Popes and Prelates of the Church, who most contend for Jurisdiction, do most neglect this most essential prime part of their Commission, and relinquish it to inferiour Priests, Ministers, Curates, to whom they deny the power of Jurisdiction. Leo 1. Epist: 86: Concil: Hisp. Surius Concil. Tom. 1. p. 500. Tom. 2. p. 719. Rabanus Mau∣rus De Instit. Cler. l. 1: c. 4. Concil. Trident. Sssio. 23. De Sacramento Ordinis. Summa Angelica & Ro∣sella. Tit. Ordo & Jurisdictio. The third Commission whereon the Pope and his flatterers principally erect St. Peters and their absolute Ecclesiastical Soveraign Supremacy over all other Apostles, Ministers, Priests, Kings, Emperors, Kingdoms, and Catholick Church on Earth; and upon which all Bishops, Presbyters, Priests do bottom their pretended divine Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over Emperors, Kings, and all Secular persons, as appro∣priate to their functions, consistories, and incommunicable to Princes or Laymen; is, that which was generally given by Christ to all the Apostles, yea to private Christi∣ans and Lay-men, and the whole Church, before Christs passion, Mat. 18. 18. Veri∣ly I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoe∣ver ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. Thus renewed, confirmed to all the Apostles by Christ in behalf of the whole Church, after his resurrection in other words; Jesus breathed on the Disciples and said,John 20. 22. 23 Receive ye the holy Ghost; whosoever sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. Which Commission, though thus twice joyntly given to all the Apostles alike by Christ; yet because he first granted this commission to them, directing his speech personally to Peter, Mat: 16. 18, 19. I say unto thee, thou art Peter, &c. And I WILL (not now do) give unto thee the keyes of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven. Popes and Popish writers thence conclude St. Peters and others Universal Supremacy over the whole Church, and all other Apostles and Bishops whatsoever as well as Kings and Emperors. I answer, That these Commissions (if rightly examined) do neither give St. Peter nor his pretended Successors, nor any Prelates or Ecclesiastical persons such an in∣herent Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, distinct from the Regal and Temporal, and incommunicable to Lay persons, as is pretended. For 1. Every particular person, though a Lay man, or private Christian, hath an absolute power, yea special command from Christ himself, to pardon, forgive and remit sins, and offences committed against himself: as this clause in the Lords Prayer,Mat: 6. 13, 14, 15. c. 28. 15, to 22. Lu: 6. 37. c. 11. 4, 6. Mar. 11. 25, 26. Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespasse against us; These precepts When ye pray standing forgive; for if ye forgive their Trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses; Forgive and you shall be forgiven;Ephes: 4. 32. 2 Cor. 2. 7, 10, 11. Forgive one another, as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you, with other Scriptures demonstrate. And as they may thus pardon, loose, and forgive: so they may likewise binde, or retain sinnes and trespasses against them, when the parties are obstinate and impenitent. This is e∣vident
by Luke 17. 3, 4. If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him, and if he re∣pent, forgive him: And if he trespasse against thee seven times a day, and seven times in a day return unto thee, saying I repent, thou shalt forgive him, (but not without repentance:) Compared with 2 Thess: 3. 14, 15. Rom: 16. 17, 18. 1 Cor: 5. 11, 12, 13, and Mat: 18. 15, 16, 17. Moreover, if thy brother trespasse against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother: But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church; and if he shall neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee (mark it, not them) as an heathen man, and a publican; Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose in earth, shall be loosed in heaven. Therefore the self-same Commission, Authority of binding and loosing up∣on earth is given to every private person in this Original Text by Christ, as was gi∣ven to Peter, Mat: 16. 18, 19. and to all the Apostles, John 20. 22, 23. HenceDe Verbis Domini secund. Mat. Sermo 16. St. Augustin resolves, Cum caepisti habere fratrem tuum tanquam Publicanum, Ligis illum in terra, cum autem corrigeris & concordaveris cum fratre tuo, solvisti illum in terra Cum solveris in terra, solutus erit in coelo:Enarratio in Mat. cap. 18. p. 45. Theophylact is yet more punctual; Si tu offensum eum habes eum qui te affecit injuria, sicut Publicanum & Gentilem, erit ille et in coelo talis. Si autem solveris eum, hoc est, si illi condonaveris, erit illi et in coelo condonatum. Non enim solum quae solvunt Sacerdotes sunt soluta, sed quae cunque nos et iniuria assecti, vel ligamus vel solvimus, et ipsa erum ligata et soluta. And if every private person may thus bind and loose as well as Priests, as these two Fathers, together withDefence of the Apology, 2 part cap. 6. div: 2. p. 176, 177. Bishop Jewel and others resolve; then much more may Kings and Supream temporal Magistrates do it, in their Courts and Con∣sistories. Our VenerableIn cap. 5 Ja∣cobi. Beda,In 4 Senten: Distinct. 17. Peter Lombard,In 4 Sent. Di∣stinct. 17. Art. 3. Scotus, with other Po∣pish School-men, yea theirGratian De Poenit: Dist. 1. Extravag. De officio Judicis Ordinat. Pasto∣ralis, in Glossa. Canon Law, and Canonists resolve; That in the absence or want of a Priest, a man may confesse his sins to his coequal or neighbout, yea open his dai∣ly and lesser sins to his neighbor, where there is a Priest, and receive absolution from him though a Layman, as well as from a Priest. And that they may do so even by divine Insti∣tution, is most fully demonstrated by Jam: 5. 16. (written to the twelve Tribes scattered abroad) who are thus admonished; Confesse your faults one to another, (not to a Pope, Bishop, Priest) and pray for one another, that ye may be healed; from which Text not only many Antients, butJewel, Mousin Chamier, Chemnitius, Willet, Fulk, Field, White, & others of Confession. most Orthodox Protestant Divines resolve; That no privat christian (in point of conscience) is obliged to confess his sins to a Priest, any more then to an∣other private Christian, and Laymen no more obliged to confesse their sins to Priests, then Priests are to confesse their sins to Laymen; and that this text makes the duty of confessing their sins, faults one to another reciprocal, being coupled with mutual praying for one another; the Bishop, Priest being bound to pray for the people, as well as the peo∣ple for the Bishop or Priest; therefore to confesse unto them, as far forth as they are to confesse to him. 2ly. I answer, That the power of binding and loosing, retaining and remitting pub∣like or scandalous sinnes, is not given to Peter, the Apostles, Popes, Bishops, Priests or Ecclesiastical persons, as an inherent priviledge and jurisdiction peculiar to them alone, but to the whole Church and congregation, to whom the right and execution thereof principally appertains. This is infallibly demonstrated, by Mat. 18. 17. If he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church or Congregation; and if he shall neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee (not the Church) as an heathen man, and a publican; This word Church or Congregation, is never taken throughout the Scripture for any one particular person, whether High Priest, Priest Apostle, Bishop or Presbyter, nor yet for two, three, or more Apostles, Bishops, Priests, Ministers, assembled together without, or as contradistinct from the Laity; but ever for the whole Church or congregation either as conjoyned with the Apostles, Bishops, Ministers, and sometimes without them, for Lay christians alone, as severed from their Bishops and Pastors; particularly in these signal Texts, Acts 15. 3, 4, 5. And when Paul, Barnabas, and other of them were come to Jerusalem, they were re∣ceived of the Church, and of the Apostles and Elders, being brought on their way by the Church, And he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the Churches. Acts 14. 23, 27. And when they had ordained them Elders in every Church, they commended them to the Lord. And when they were come to An∣tioch, and had gathered the Church together, they rehearsed all that God had done
with them; which Church is stiled the multitude gathered together; (not Bishops or Priests) Acts 15. 30. c. 16. 5. So were the Churches established in the faith. c. 20. 17. 28. And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the Elders of the Church, (not Elders the Church.) And then gave them this charge; Take heed to your selves, and to all the flock over which the holy Ghost hath made you Bishops; to feed the Church, (distinguished from the Bishops feeding them) which he hath purchased with his own bloud. Acts 21. 18, to 25. The day following Faul went in with us to James, and all the Elders were present: And when he had sa∣luted them, & they heard his relation, and what was reported of him by the Jewish Proselytes, they concluded; The Multitude or Church must needs come to¦gether to hear the businesse; put in distinction from Iames and the Elders of the Church at Ierusalem. Rom: 16. 16. The Churches of Christ salute you. Gaius my host, and of the whole Church saluteth you. Thus the words, Church and Churches are used 1 Cor. 1. 2, 3. c. 7. 17. c. 11. 16. 18. c. 12. 28. c. 14. 4. 23, 33, 34. c. 16. 1. 5. 2 Cor: 1. 1. c. 8. 18, 19, 23, 24. c. 11. 8. 28. c. 12, 13 Gal: 1. 19. 22.

And if meant of it, or of the Jewes Sanhedrim or Councel; St. Peter, and the Pope, with his Conclave of Cardinals, being no such Council or Church, (consisting of the Princes of the Tribes of Israel, and 72 Laymen) not of Priests alone, and no Successors to them by Divine institution; the Jewish State, Priesthood, Church, ceremonies, being totally abolished by Christ; the Pope and other Prelates can pray in no ayde from this much wrested, abused, mistaken Text, to support their pretended Supremacy, and divine Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction: (principally vested in the whole Church) which is to rebuke, loose, seclude, re∣tain or absolve penitent or impenitent scandalous sinners, as St. Paul himself resolves, 1 Cor: 5. throughout. When ye are gathered together in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, to deliver such a one to Satan. Purge out therefore the old leven, that ye may be a new Lump. Do not ye judge them that are within? Therefore put away from Your selves that wicked person: spoken to and of the whole Church of Corinth, not to the Ministers of Elders thereof. 2 Cor: 2. 6, 7. Sufficient for such a man is this cen∣sure inflicted by many, (the whole Church, not the Apostle, Pope, Bishop) So that contrariwise, ye ought rather to forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up of grief; Wherefore I beseech you, that you would confirm your love to∣wards him. To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also. 2 Thess: 3. 14. If any man obey not our Epistle, note ye that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. Rom: 16. 17.

This binding and loosing, remitting and retaining sinnes, was not by any judicial sentence pronounced by the Apostles in any Consistory Court where they sate as Supream Judges, as Popes, and other Prelates since have done; the Apostles having no such Courts, nor exercising such a Soveraign Jurisdiction in them, as these since have done, for whichIn Mat. cap: 16. St: Jerom thus sharply reprehends them; Istum lo∣cum Episcopi & Presbytri non intelligentes, aliquid sibi de Pharisaeorum assumunt supercilio, ut vel damnent innocentes, vel solvere se noxios arbitrentur, cum apud Deum, non sententia Sacerdotum, sed reorum vita ponderatur. Alligat & solvit Episcopus vel Presbyter eos qui insontes sunt, vel noxii; sed pro officio suo cum peccatorum audierit va∣rietates, scit qui ligandus sit, qui solvendus &c: That is, as4 Sentent. Dst: 18. cap. . Peter Lombard interprets it, Dominus tribuit Scerditibus potestatem Ligandi & Solvendi, id est, ostendendi ho∣minibus Ligatos & Solvendos; in and by the preaching of the Gospel to them; accor∣ding to Christs commission; He that repenteth, believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; here is the loosing and remitting; He that repenteth not nor believeth, shall be damned; and the wrath of God abideth on him; here is the binding and retaining; by the keyes of the kingdom of heaven, to wit, the Gospel, which shuts and opens heaven gates, admits or excludes, inherits or disinherits them of it; and is the savor of life unto life to those who believe it, but the savor of death unto death to those who believe it not; as is evident by Mar: 16. 16.

Answer to the J Change. 4ly. This power of binding, retaining, loosing and remitting sinnes, with the keys of the kingdom of heaven whereby this is done, were equally given to all the Apostles, as farre forth as to Peter; Christs words, I will give to thee the keyes of the Kingdom of heaven, &c. being in the future, not present tense; giving him no actual possessi∣on of the keys, kingdom of heaven til after Christs ascension, & then but joyntly with the rest of the Apostles,In Mat. tract. 1.

Yea every ordinary Minister, Presby∣ter, Priest, hath as large a divine power in the Keyes, as the Pope himself, or the grea∣test Patriarch, Archbishop, Bishop in the world; and may as absolutely, fully bind, loose, absolve, retain mens sinnes as they, their Commissions being all one and the same; and their power herein, not judicial, but meerly ministerial, declaratory, not definitive, the absolute judicial power of shutting and opening heaven, pardoning, remit∣ting, retaining sins, and absolving, condemning sinners, being peculiar to God and Christ alone as Isay 22. 22.

Therefore if these Texts give a∣ny Supream Ecclesiastical Authority over Kings and the whole Church to St. Peter, or the Pope; they give the very same to every Priest, Curate whatsoever; and so we shall have as many Popes, yea Vicars generals and Viceroyes of Christ over the Church, all Christian Kings, Emperors, and their kingdoms, as there are Priests. 5ly. I have long admired, how any Pope or Prelate from this borrowed Metaphor of the Keyes of the Kingdom of heaven given to Peter or others, can pretend to such a tran∣scendent Soveraign Ecclesiastical & Temporal Jurisdiction, too, as some of them claim from thence; Since I never read in any Text, Story, That Keyes were an Emblem of Supream Iurisdiction, but theRom. 13. 4.

Bonaventura confesseth, most of their Ordinary Masse Priests want, being so ignorant, that they are utterly voyd of all true saving knowledge of the sacred Scriptures. Most of these Keyes,Gratian, Distinct: 10. 21. 22. Alvarus Pelagius De Planctu Eccles: lib. 1. Artic: 37, 51, 53, 55, 56, &c. they appropriate to the Pope originally, and from him derivatively to Bishops. But since they have not in all their New Bunch of Keyes, The Key of Faith, and knowledge of the word of God, which only opens heavens gate; and since the gate of heaven is very strait, and but one, and so needs not such a multiplicity of Keyes, or pick-locks to open it as the Bishop Jewels Defence of the Apology, part 2. divis: 6, 7. p. 182, 183. &c.

Cardinals, Priests, but over all Christian Kings, Emperors, Princes, not only to feed, but to excommu∣nicate, depose, kill them; divide, or give their Crowns, kingdoms to others. To which I answer 1. That the High Priests and Priests in the Old Testament were obliged by their office, duty to feed, teach and instruct their flocks, as well as St. Pe∣ter and the Apostles under the New: as is largely resolved (with much expostulati∣on by God himself against those who neglected it) Jer: 23. 1, to 16. Ezech: 34. 2. to 24. Zech: 11. 7. 2 Chron: 17. 7, 8, 9. Neh. 8. 7. c. 7. 15. and other Texts. But the High Priests under the Law claimed no such Soveraignty or Jurisdiction over the people: much lesse over Moses, Joshua, Supream temporal Magistrates, or their Kings, by this their pastoral charge, power, to feed Gods sheep and flock; as I have See here, p. 5, 6. Bishop Jewels Defence of the Apology, 8 part. ch. 1. divis. 4. p. 711, 712. formerly proved, and shall here further illustrate by the example of Aaron the first High Priest; who was subject and subordinate to Moses the Israelites first chief Civil Governour, being no Priest by birthright, nor consecration, asSee here p. 9. Hardings Reply to Jewel. some Po∣pish writers would now make him: First because Aaron was hisExod: 7. 7. Num: 33. 39. Deut. 34. elder Brother by 3 years, & so the only Priest by birthright, & the high Priest byExod: 40. 12, to 17. Here, p. 5. Bishop Carlton of Ju∣risdiction Roy∣al, Episcopal, Papal, p. 32, 33, 34. Moses special consecration; who at his deathNum. 20. 25. to 29. stripped him of his high priests robes, and put them on Eleazar his son. 2ly. Because he never consecrated himself a Priest, as he did Aaron and his sons, nor was he ever consecrated a Priest by others. 3ly. BecauseLevit: 10. 16, to 20. he never offered burnt offerings or sacrifices, nor intermedled with the proper office of the Priests, but charged them alone to do it. 4ly. Because the word Priest in Psal: 99. 6. 9. whence they would conclude Moses a Priest, signifies as well a1 Sam. 8. 18. 1 Chron. 18 17. Exod. 2. 16. Gen. 47. 22. 26 Prince as a Priest, and therefore cannot con∣clude him a Priest, but Prince among them. Now though Aaron was high Priest, and Moses his younger brother, yet Aaron was subject to his Jurisdiction, Power, Cen∣sure; as these 2. Scriptures evidence. First Moses particularlyNum. 12. 1. to 16. reprehended Aaron and the Priests for burning and not eating the sin-offering in the holy place, according to their duty and Gods prescription; for which Aaron made his Apology to him. 2ly.Num. 1. 11 By Gods anger against Aaron, and smiting his Sister Miriam with Leprosy, only for speaking against Moses for marying an Ethiopian woman, and using these seditious words against him; Hath the Lord only spoken by Moses? hath he not also spoken by us? in derogation of his Authority. 4ly. By Aarons confessing of his sinne, and craving pardon of him for it in this submissive manner, Alas,In Veteri le∣ge Sacerdotium indignius erat Potestate Regia & ei subjectum Johannis de Parisiiis, De Potest. Regia & Papali, c. 5. My Lord, I beseech thee lay not this sin up∣on us;Levit. 10. 14. to 20. wherein we have dealt foolishly. 5ly. By Aarons intercession to Moses for Miriam after God had smitten her with Leprosy, and then healed her upon his prayer; that she might not be put out of the Camp; Which Moses refused to grant, shutting her out of the Camp seven dayes ere he restored her: Seeing then this Pastoral office of fee∣ding advanced not Aaron above Moses, to whom he was high Priest; who continued (l) subject to his Supream Ecclesiastical and Civil Jurisdiction; How Christs command to Peter to feed his Sheep, can elevate his pretended Successors above Kings, Empe∣rors, and all other Bishops, no rational Christian can discern. 2ly. Every Apostle, Minister, Priest, Bishop in and under the Gospel is expresly enjoyned and bound ex officio, to feed Christs sheep, lambs, flock committed to his charge, as well as Peter: as is evident by this question and demand of God himself, Ezech: 34. 2. Should not the Shepherds feed the Flocks? which infallibly inti∣mates, that they should and ought to do it under the Gospel as well as Law: by Jer: 11. 15. I will give you Pastors after mine own heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. Jer: 23. 4. And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them; both meant of the times of the Gospel; by these expresse Gospel Texts Acts 20. 28. where Paul gave this strict charge to all the Elders and Bishops of Ephe∣sus, Takeheed therefore unto your selves, and to all the Flock over which the holy Ghost hath made you Bishops (to what end?) to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood; Which words, Feed the Church of God, are certainly as u∣niversal, as Feed my sheep, feed my Lambs: 1 Cor: 9. 7. Who Feedeth a Flock and eateth not of the milk thereof? applied by St. Paul to all Ministers and Preachers of
the Gospel, who ought to live of the Gospel. Yea, (which is most observable;) St. Peter himself (as if he had purposely foreseen his pretended Successors ambitious Monopoly; and claim of Feeding Christs Sheep to himself, to erect a new Monarchy, tyranny over them, by a prophetical Spirit, and purposely writ against it) for ever refutes their pretences in this memorable passage, 1 Pet. 5. 1, to 5. The Elders that are among you I exhort , ut Compresbyter, or Consenior, (as the Vulgar, Jerom, Arias Montanus, and other Latin Translations render it) as your fellow Elder, (yea fel∣low-shepherd too) (not chief Head, Pastor, Feeder of the Universal Church of Christ) , feed the Flock of God which is among you, taking the over∣sight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready minde; : not as Lords over (or, as Domineering and ruling over) the Lords heritage, but being ensamples to the flock; And when the Chief Shep∣herd (acknowledged by Peter himself after Christs Resurrection to be Christ alone, not himself) shall appear, ye shall receive a Crown of glory that fadeth not away. Whence St. Peter expresly enjoynes them to feed the flock as Shepherds only, not as Kings or Lords over them. 3ly. Christ himselfJohn 10. 14. the good,Hebr. 13. 20. Great,1 Pet: 5. 3. Chief Shepherd of his sheep, informs us; that as he himself, so every otherJohn 10. 1, to 5. good shepherd that entreth in by the door, doth not only guard, but feed his sheep, and the sheep hear his voyce, and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out, and he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. Every Apostle, Bishop, Minister of the Gospel is as much a Shepherd of Christs sheep, as Peter; therefore bound to feed Christs sheep, Lambs as much as he. This St:De dignitate Sacerd. cap. 2. Ambrose long since asserted: Dominus dixit Petro, Pasce oves meas; Quas oves, quem gregem non solum tunc beatus Petrus caepit, sed et nobiscum eas succe∣pit, et cum illo eas nos suscepinus omnes. AndIn Vita Soli∣taria c. 23. St. Basil goes a little further to his Keyes as well as feeding. Petre inquit, amas me? Pasce oves meas: & conse∣quenter omnibus Pastoribus et Doctoribus eandem potestatem tribuit: Cujus signum est, Qoud omnes ex aequo obligant, et absolvunt, quemadmodum ille.

Ezech: 34. 2, 3, 4, &c. sed & ipse Dominus Simoni sic dixit: Diligis me? respondit; Diligo: ait ei, Pasce oves meas, Hoc verbum factum ex actu ipso quo cessit cognoscimus, & caeteri Dis∣cipuli similiter fecerunt, Nolumus ergo fratres devotissimi vos mercenarios inveniri, sed bonos Pastores, &c. Resolving every Apostle, Bishop, Minister, to be as much Pa∣stors, and as far bound to feed Christs sheep as Peter. Therefore if this gave Peter a Soveraign Jurisdiction over all the Church, and Kings themselves, it must give the like to all other Bishops, Priests, Ministers; and so we shall have as many Popes, Vicars Generals, and Supreme heads of the Church of Christ paramount all Kings and Emperors, as there are Priests and Bishops. 4ly. The sheep thus fed; are not St. Peters, nor any Popes; Bishops sheep that feeds them; but only thePsal: 100. 3. Psal: 79. 13. John 10. 2, to 26. Acts 20. 28. Jer: 23. & Ezech: 34. John 21. 16. sheep, flock of Jesus Christ, for whom he hath laid down his life, yea purchased, redeemed them with his own most precious bloud. There∣fore their bare feeding of can give them no dominion or Soveraign Jurisdiction over them, no more then it doth to any Ordinary countrey Shepherd which feeds, keeps, folds his Lords or Masters sheep, who can neither shear, sell, thrust them out of the fold, pasture, nor kill or dispose of them at his pleasure; but only guard, feed, fold, carefully watch over and lead them into such pastures as his Lord pre∣scribes: his shepherds office being only a painfull,Gen. 31. 39. 40. carefull Service, Ministry, not a Dominion or Dignity. 5ly. All the acts, duties of St: Peters or any other Apostles, Bishops, Ministers Pa∣storal
office in relation to Christs flock are meerly servile, ministerial towards their sheep for their preservation and welfare, not Lordly or Jurisdictional: as namely, 1. ToPsal. 23. 2. Isa. 40. 11. Acts 20 28. Gen. 29 2, to 18. Ezech. 34, 14, 16, 18. water and feed them in good, green pastures, with the wholesom food of Gods word. 2ly. ToGen: 31. 29, 30. Lu. 2. 8. Ezech. 34: 2, to 10. John 10. 2, to 12. watch over them day and night; and guard them from Wolves, Theeves, Robbers that would devour, kill, seduce, destroy them. 3ly. To1 Pet: 5. 2, 3. John 10. 3, 4, 5 go in and out before them in an holy and exemplary conversation. 4ly. ToEzech. 34. 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16. Ps. 119. 76 Isay 53. 6. Jer. 50. 6. 17. Mat. 15. 24, c. 18. 12, 13. Lu: 15. 4, 5. gather them toge∣ther when they are scattered by any persecutions, Wolves, casualties, and to seek them out and bring them home to their fold and pasture, when they are strayed thence. 5ly. To John 10. 10. to 16, 1 Sam: 17, 34, 35. stand by them in their greatest dangers without flying, and to lay down their lives for their safety and defence against Wolves and Robbers. 6ly. ToIsay 40. 11. Ezech. 34. 4. to 17. Numb. 32. 16. gather the Lambs with their arms & carry them in their bosoms; to lead those gently that ar with young, to bind them up which are broken, and to heal and strengthen them that are sick. 7ly. To fold and make them lie down in safety. 8ly.Ezech 34. 4, to 7. John 10. 10, to 15. 1 Pet. 5. 2. Psal. 44. 11. Not to feed themselves instead of the flock, by eating the fat, or cloathing themselves with their wooll, nor yet to kill, starve or fly from them, nor to rule them with fear, force, cruelty, as Lords over them; nor to use and call them out as sheep appointed for the slaughter, as Popes use to do. Wherefore none of all these Pastoral positive duties importing the least Dominion or Jurisdiction over Christs sheep, but only a ministry and service towards, for them, accompanied with an heavy wo and account if neglected; and the Negative part, expresly prohi∣bits all Lordly Dominion and Jurisdiction over them; How Popes, Prelates or Priests can hence conclude any Supreame Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over Christs Church and flock to be vested in themselves alone, (not in Kings) (who are to feed, rule them by way of Government and Jurisdiction as Kings, but not as meer spiritual shepherds) transcends my apprehension. Yet hear whatQuest: 3. nu. 14, 15, 16. Marti∣nus Becanus the Moguntine Jesuite concludes from hence, in his Controversia Angli∣cana, De Potestate Regis & Pontificis, contra Lancelotum Andreum, Mogunt. 1612. and let all Christian Kings and their Subjects consider it as well with detestation, as admiration; The Pope as Shepherd, who is to feed Christs sheep, hath his Doggs; (And who are they?) Hi canes intelliguntur partim Reges et Imperatores, These Doggs (of this proud shepherd) are partly Kings and Emperors; (they must be no longer Sheep, but Currs.) Then descanting upon these their honourable Royal Titles: Igitur hi Canes, These Doggs therefore if they be watchfull, they must be ready at the Shepherds hand: but if they be lazie, madd or troublesom, the Shepherd must pre∣sently remove them. This He teacheth; this the Council of Lateran decreeth. He subjoynes; Christian Kings are Sheep, are Rammes, are Wolves, and are Doggs: (though Christ and St: Peter never made such distinctions of them) Whence it is that the Pope beareth himself in a divers manner towards them. As they are Sheep, if they be silly, he may put them out of the fold: As they are Rammes, if they be troublesom and push with their horns, (against his Miter) he may shut them up: As they are Wolves he may drive them away: Quatenus Canes, as they are Doggs, he may put them from their office, if they be defective therein: and some of these he doth by Excom∣munication, others by Deposition. Thus Becanus concludes, against Gods, the Prophet Jeremiahs, Ezechiels, Christs, and St: Peters own Glosses and Resolutions on this Pasce oves meas: metamorphosing sheep, but specially Kings, Emperors who are such, into Doggs, Wolves allegorically, and the Pope the pretended Chief shep∣herd into both, really and practically, to his eternal infamy. 6ly. If these Commissions to Saint Peter will not evidence the Popes Supremacy over other Bishops, Priests, Kings and Emperors, yet there is one Commission more will certainly effect and conclude it without dispute, Acts 10. 10, to 17 where Peter falling into a trance, saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel let down unto him like a great sheet, knit at four corners, let down to the earth; wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth (therefore sheep amongst the rest) and wilde beasts, and creeping things, and fouls of the air; and there came a voyce unto him; Rise Pe∣ter, kill and eat. But Peter said, Not so Lord, for I have never eaten that which was common or unclean: And the voyce spake again unto him the second time; What God hath clensed, that call not thou common. This was done thrice, and the Vessel was received again into heaven. WhenceAlvarus Pela∣gius, de Planctu Eccles. l. 1. at∣tic. 55. Bellarm. De Romano Pontif. l. 5. c. 4, 5, 6, 7, &c. some Romish Parasites, Janizaries conclude from Surge Petre, macta & manduca, by their own Chymical Divinity, per quod innuitur quod Petrus Praelatus fuit populis Vniversis, vas autem illud orbem universum signat,
et universitas contentum in eo significat; tam Judaeorum quam Gentilium Nationes; yea some of them assert, the lawfulnesse of the Popes deposing and murdering Chri∣stian Kings, Princes, by his assassinates from this Text. I answer, first: That Arise Peter, kill and eat, if meant of sheep, is very ill cou∣pled with, Simon, feed my sheep; being directly contrary to his pastoral duty and of∣fice, Ezech. 34, 3, to 6. John 10. 1, to 6. 2ly. There were no Kings, Emperors, nor men at all in this vessel, but only four-footed beasts, creeping things and fowls, which God provided for the food of man, and gave all men as free power to kill and eat, as he did here to Peter; Gen. 9, 2, 3, 4. Levit. 11. 2, 3, 9. Deuter. 14. 4. How then that which is the common priviledge of all mankinde to kill and eat such beasts, can be a peculiar Supremacy in Peter alone; Or how Kings, Emperors, men, can be inten∣ded or typified in or by these beasts, or eaten by St. Peter, like beasts, fouls and creep∣ing things, to advance Peters pretended Supremacy; or how Peters spurious Suc∣cessors can be enabled by this Text to depose, excommunicate, kill and eat the flesh of Kings, Emperors, men, whereas God himself when he first gave Commission to Noah and Mankinde to kill and eat of every beast of the earth, creeping thing, fowl of the air, and fish of the sea,Gen. 9. 2, to 8. prohibited them to kill or eat the flesh of any man, threatning to re∣quire the blood of the life of every man at his brothers hand; without making St. Peter and his Successors Canibals and Murderers; yea beasts and fowls instead of men; (whom God only commissioned to eat the flesh of Kings, Captains, mighty men, free and bond, Rev. 19. 17, 18.) I cannot discern. 3ly. St. Peter notwithstanding this invita∣tion, (not simple command) didActs 10. 14, 15, 16. neither kill nor eat any of these beasts, fowls, but absolutely refused to do it; whereupon they were taken up again into heaven, as the Text relates. How then come his pretended Successors, both to kill and eat, when he refused to do either? and to ground their Supremacy thereon? It seems they are now more hungry and voracious then St. Peter was then. 4ly. This whole History was no reality, but aActs 10. 10, 11. meer trance and vision, wherein was a mixture of all sorts of beasts, creatures, as well clean as unclean by theLevit. 11. 2. &c. Deut. 14. 4 Levitical Law; which beasts and fowls Peter then conceived he might not lawfully eat: Now the end of this vi∣sion was double; First to instruct Peter,Col. 2. 14, 15, 16. 21, 22. 1 Cor. 8. 9. Rom. 14. 14. 1 Tim. 4. 4, 5. 1 Cor. 10. 25. to 31. that the Levitical Law putting a difference between unclean and clean beasts, was then totally abolished, and all of them to be freely eaten by Jews as well as Gentiles. 2. That theActs 10. 19, 20, 34, 35, 45, 46, 47. c. 11. 2, to 19. Ephes. 2. 13, to 18. Gentiles were now as holy and dear unto God as the Jewes, Christ having broken down the wall of partition that was between them; as the sequel of that Chapter and Peter himself relates, chap: 11. Now how this vi∣sion only to inform and instruct St. Peters judgement in these two particulars, can give him or the Pope such a Soveraign Jurisdiction, as they by head and shoulders deduce from it, let all rational men resolve. The 7th. Commission theSee Marsilius Patavinus De∣fens. Pacis, l. 2. c. 3. Pontificians have found out given by Christ to Peter, is that of Matth. 21. 2, 3. Then sent Jesus two Disciples (whereof the Romanists averr Peter to be one) saying unto them, Go ye into the village over against you, and straight way ye shall find an Ass tied, and a colt with her: Loose them and bring them unto me. And if any say ought unto you, ye shall say, the Lord hath need of them, and straightway they will send them. And the Disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. From whence they inferr, that the Pope hath power to bind, loose, excommunicate and depose Kings, Emperors, absolve their Subjects from their Allegiance, and take away their Crowns, kingdoms from them, when (he their Lord) hath need of them (as he did King Johns and others) as Peter did thus loose and take away the Ass, Colt, and bring them unto Christ. I Answer First; That it appears not by any story that Peter was one of those two Disciples that loosed and brought away this Asse and Colt to Christ. 2ly. Admit he was, yet he had another disciple equally joyned with him in Commission; which de∣stroyes his sole Monarchy and Supremacy. 3ly. They went not about this errand till Christ gave them a special Commission for it; But Popes run in a quite contrary errand, to depose Kings and Emperors before they are sent by Christ, yea against his expresse inhibition. 4ly. They did not take them away without the owners consent, but with it, as the words straightway they will send them imply: Whereas Popes depose and take away Kings and Emperors Crowns, kingdoms, and absolve their Subjects from their Allegiance against their wils. 5ly. Christ did not send them to take away the propriety, but only to borrow the use of this Asse and Colt, at this ve∣ry instant, (not the Crowns, Scepters, or kingdoms ofThough he rode as a King into Jerusalem. Kings) and that only for his
necessary use for a few hours, even then when he rode like a King, in greatest tri∣mph he ever used on earth, into Jerusalem, and then sent them back. Popes do not borrow, but forcibly seise, detain not the Asses or Horses of Kings, Emperors, but their Crowns, and kingdoms too; which Christ never commissioned, nor sent Pe∣ter, or any other Disciples to demand or take from Kings, and bring them unto him. 6ly. Those Disciples were sent only to loose a meer natural Asse and Colt for Christ to ride upon, not Emperors, Kings, Princes, on whose backs Christ never rode, on whose heads, crowns he never trampled, whiles prostrate at his feet, as Anti∣christian Sacrar. Cere∣mon. l. 1. c. 8. 10. Bp. Jewels Def. of the Apology, p. 463. Popes have frequently done; neither had he Emperors or Kings to hold his stirrop, bridle, when he ascended on the Asses back, as Popes have made Em∣perors and Kings to hold theirs. 7ly. No argument for the Popes Supremacy can be deduced hence, but only that Peter was here an Asse-driver, not a Shepheard; that his Keyes were now transformed into a halter orPsal. 32. 3. Prov. 26. 3. bridle to muzzle Asses: that Em∣perors and Kings are now metamorphosed not only into Sheep, Wolves, Dogs, (as Becanus formerly asserted) but into Popes Asses too, which have no understanding: This his great ChampionEcclesiastic.

Gastar Schioppius is not ashamed with greatest impuden∣cy directly to proclaim to all the world, in this most scurrillous passage, in allusion to this Text. Ecclesia est Mandra, sive Grex aut multitudo jumentorum, sive Auno∣rum clitellariorum seu sagmariorum, &c. The Church (he means the Roman, and see the Members thereof how observe it) is a great fold or stable of Beasts or Asses; of which some are Pack-Asses, some are Dosse-Asses, and others Burden Asses, Then relating cuiusmodi Auni sunt nos Catholici? (what sort of Asses we the Roman Catholicks are) We (writes he) must be beasts which have understanding and rea∣son to obey the Bishops with all humility and patience; for they are the men, they the Muleters and Asse-drivers,Nota. they must yoak, bridle and saddle us, put halters about our necks, load & drive us. For others, they are like to beasts, but tame & mode∣rate beasts, such as must do what they are commanded, for a good understanding Asse is he, that honoureth and followeth the direction and command of the Mulettier. He addes, Reges Catholici sunt Asini cum tintinnabulis; Catholick Kings are Asses with Bells about their necks, as being the Fore Asses, leading the way to other inferior Asses. Then much commending Charles the Great, he writes, That Charles was a farr greater and wiser Asse, then those Kings that cast off the Popes yoak; for Charles being tantus Asinus, so great an Asse, cryed (or rather brayed) out with a loud voyce, Vniversae Asinorum mandrae, to the whole fold of Asses; that is, to the whole Church in this manner, For the memory of St. Peter let us honor the Roman Church; and though the yoke which the Pope imposeth be such as we can hardly bear, yet let us fall down under the same. Ex quibus verbis verum Issachar agnoscas, de quo Gen. ch. 49. Issachar Asinus fortis. From which words of Charles, thou maist know he was a very Issachar, of whom it is said Gen. 49. Issachar is a strong Asse. Thus Schioppius. Is not this fine Catholick Divinity, enough to enamour all Christian Kings, Princes with the Church of Rome? which is now become a fold of Asses, instead of a flock of Sheep, and their Popes, Bishops, Mu∣leters, and Asse-drivers, instead of Shepherds? I shall not waste Ink and Paper to answer the other pretended Commissions given by Christ to St. Peter, on which Popes and their Parasites likewise ground their univer∣sal Supremacy, asSee Marsilius Patavinus, De∣fens. pacis, p. 2. c. 3.

Rather by way of jear to others who thus descanted on it, then in seriousnesse. Yet Waldensis gravely infers thence. Quam synceriter, quamque subtiliter enucleat pa∣ter Bernardus eminentiam summi Sacerdotis, & fastigium Christi Vicarii ab ipsis me∣dullis Evangelii rutilantis? making a large descant on them. But the repetition of these crazie enthusiastical arguments and aiery conceits, to evidence the Popes Supremacy from such impertinent texts, or ratherInter secula∣res, nugae nugae sunt, in ore sa∣cerdotis blas∣phemiae. Bern: de Consid. l. 2. blasphemies, is a sufficient refutation of them. 6ly. When all these Commissions to the Apostles, Peter, and forecited Texts, will not prop up the Popes tottering Universal Supremacy, they then flye to his Sword, as to their Triarii, and last refuge, yet with very ill successe, if the Texts and inferences from them be well examined. Our Saviour being near his Passion used these words to his Disciples, Luke 22. 34. to 39. When I sent you without purse, or scrip, or shoes, (orMat. 10. 9, 10. staves) lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. Then sain he unto them; But now, he that hath a purse let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no Sword, let him sell his garment and buy him one. And they said, Behold here are two Swords; And he said unto them, It is enough conjoyned with Matth. 26. 51, 52. John 18. 10, 11. Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high Priests servant, and cut off his right ear. Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath, or into his place; for all they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink? From which Texts, Popes and theirBernard. de Consid. ad Eu∣genium, l. 4. Alvarus Pelagi∣us de Planctu Eccles. l. 1. Art. 12. & 54. l. 2. Artic. 57. Gra∣tian Distinct. 21. caus. 23. qu. 1. Glossa. Ab∣bas Vspergensis p. 343. Here, p. 36. Johannis Par∣siensis de Pote∣state Regali & Papali. Paralites, have drawn these strange Con∣clusions, universally embraced by most as infallible Oracles. 1. That these two Swords here mentioned, were the Supream Ecclesiastical and Tem∣poral Swords of Authority and Jurisdiction, here instituted and distinguished by Christ himself. 2ly. That those two Swords are distinct in their own Natures: the one origi∣nally put into the hand of St. Peter and his Successors of Rome alone, and derivative∣ly by and through him into the hands of the other Apostles, Bishops, Priests, incommunica∣ble unto any Temporal Kings or Princes. The other put into the actual possession of Emp∣rors or Kings, by St. Peter and his Successors, to be drawn forth at their command for their and the Churches defence, as well as for the Government of their kingdoms. 3ly. That both these Swords are originally given to, and visited in St. Peter and through him in the Pope, who may dispose of, give, recall and command them at his pleasure. Strange dotages and delusions drawn by head and shoulders from these Texts. To clear which Texts from these false Glosses for the future, I shall desire the Rea∣ders to observe: 1. That the Sword which Christ commanded every of his Apostles to sell his garment (for want of money) to buy; was not a Metaphorical, Civil, or Ec∣clesiastical Sword of Authority or Jurisdiction, (which had been flat Simonie to buy) but a plain, material, iron sword, which ordinary soldiers, or servants then wore, (as since they have done, and yet do) to guard their Kings, Generals, Captains, Masters against violence: For 1. It was a sword to be bought at the Cutlers, and that for the present defence of their Master Christ. 2ly. They thereupon all answered (not Peter for them) They had then two swords, with one whereof Peter cut off Malchus his ear; therefore both only material iron swords. 3ly. St. Peters sword was drawn out of his sheath, when used, & commanded by Christ to be put again into its scabbard or place; therefore a real iron sword. 4ly. Christ gives this reason for its putting up, For all they that take the sword, shall perish by it: Therefore both the swords he commanded them to buy, the two swords they then had, when Christ said, It is enough; & the sword to be put up were only ordinary swords of common soldiers, or servants, not of Temporal Magi∣strates or Prelates. 5ly. Christ directed his speech not to Peter by name, but to all his other Apostles in general; He that hath no sword let him sell his garment & buy one; & he having then a sword of his own, this speech did not concern him, but those only who wanted swords; whence not Peter, but the other Apostles said joyntly (as they re∣plied to Christs first question, that they wanted nothing;) Behold here are two swords: which implied a tacit demand, whether they needed to buy any more? Whereupon Christ said, It is enough, there needed no more. Peter therfore not being their mouth, in this case, for ought appears; how can these two swords belong to him alone, up∣on the other Apostles answers? 6ly. It is most clear, that one of these two swords
was Peters, is evident by Christs words to him; Put up thy Sword: Yet it was on∣ly the sword of a common soldier, or servant; not of a Civil or Ecclesiastical Magi∣strate; (he being then neither) and that Apostle whose the other sword was, yea every common soldier that hath or wears a sword, may claim as absolute a Soveraign Ecclesiastical and Temporal Jurisdiction, as the Pope can do from this sword of Peter. 7ly. Peter then had, used but one sword alone, not two. How comes the Pope, his pretended Successor, to challenge two swords, and that of a farr different nature from his, and not to be content with a common Servitors or soldiers sword, as he was? 8ly. Christ himself severely checkedMat. 26. 50, 51. John. 21. 10 11. Peter for drawing, smiting with this sword, and cutting off Malchus his ear; 1. Because he did it without his command, who was his Lord and Master. 2ly. Because he did it before the band, Captain, Officers laid hold on Christ to apprehend him, so that he began the quarrel. 3ly. Because he smote Malchus that was next him, and cut off his ear, without any just provocation from him. 4ly. Because he did it with an ill intent, toMat. 26. 51, 52, 53. John 28. 11. prevent, hinder Christs crucifixion, the fulfilling of the Scriptures, and redemption of mankinde by his passion: from which he disswading him only a little before, Christ had thereupon reprehended him, with a doubleMat. 16. 23. Mar. 8. 33. Get thee behinde me Satan, thou art an offence unto me, for thou savourest not the things of God, but those that be of men. 5ly. Because he drew it out of incredulity and presumption; as if Christ could not be otherwise rescued from his apprehend∣ers, but by his rash valour, whenMat: 26. 53, 54. as his Father would have given & sent him Legions of Angels to rescue him, and prevent his crucifixion, had he desired it, or had it stood with the Scriptures, or Gods eternal purpose, and his own good pleasure; wherefore Peters draw∣ing and smiting with his sword, being sinfull, unlawfull in all these respects, can∣not possibly be a just legal foundation for his or the Popes Temporal or Spiritual Su∣premacy. 6ly. Christ commandsMat. 26. 52, 53. Peter to put up his sword into his sheath, and never to draw or use it more; because all that take the sword (without lawfull commission from God) shall perish with the sword. How then Popes, St. Peters pretended Successors, can both challenge, draw, smite with this sword of Peter, not only to cut off Mal∣chus his ear, but the Crowns, Heads of Christian Emperors, Kings, Lords, Parlia∣ments, and engage Christian Kings, kingdoms to draw their Military swords of War against each other, yea their Subjects to draw their swords against their lawfull Em∣perors, Kings, as against Turks, Infidels, when excommunicated or deprived by them, and to murther one another by thousands in the field, against this expresse pro∣hibition of Christ, and his reason thereto annexed; let Popes and their flatterers re∣solve their own and other rational mens consciences, when they are able. 8ly. Neither Peter nor any other Apostle was then a King, or Supream Civil Magistrate, nor personated any such officer, when Christ used these words of two swords, that they were enough; & gave this command to Peter, Put up thy sword into his place. How then could either of these two swords possibly signifie or represent the Kings or Magistrates Supream Civil Sword of Justice? 9ly. Neither was Peter nor any other of the Apo∣stles at this time invested with the sole Supream Ecclesiastical Power or Jurisdiction, which then wholly resided in Christ himself; How therefore can Peters material sword, transferr to the Pope or his successors, the supream Spiritual Sword of Jurisdiction over the whole Catholick Church and its members? 10ly. Those two swords, which Christ said were enough, were both of one kind; material, not metaphorical; of iron, steel; not of the Spirit; and but one of them used, or rather abused by Peter: How then can they typifie Two distinct Jurisdictions vested by Divine institution in two distinct ranks and Professions of Men, Kings and Priests, Secular Princes and Spiritual Priests? So that one of them may not usurp the sword of the other two. 11ly. If these swords, asSee Gratian Distinct. 10. Canonists define; be so different, distinct, and put into those several hands by Christs institution,Ephes. 6. 17. how came the Pope in Peters pretended Right to claim, monopolize both;Hebr. 4. 12. Rev. 1. 16. c. 2. 12. c. 19, 14, 15. when Peter had but one sword, and that of a far different nature from those Popes now pretend to? 12ly. The Scripture never distinguisheth between the Temporal and Ecclesiastical sword in the Popes and Prelates sence: Indeed it stiles the word of God,Rom. 13. 4. the sword of the spirit, and a (i) two edged sword; and the Vindi∣ctive power of the Civil Magistrate to punish evil doers, (i) a sword; but the pre∣tended Popes Ecclesiastical censures, whether of Interdicts, Excommunications,1 Cor: 5. 5. 15. John 9. 22. 34, 35. Mat 18 17. Ana∣themaes, or delivering men to Satan, putting them out of the Synagogue, or being reputed heathens or publicans, are never once stiled nor intimated in Scripture to be a Sword, or to proceed from St. Peters sword, but Keyes alone; yea Popes, Prelates, Priests, them∣selves
resolve, that all their Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, Censures are founded on the Power of Peters Keyes, not Sword; and derive them only from the Keyes which Christ committed to him and the other Apostles, not that sword which Christ commanded him to put up into the sheath, and use no more. How then came the Keyes, and these two swords (so different in their names, forms, nature, uses, the one to open, shut, bind or loose; the other to defend penitent, and smite, slay, or punish impeni∣tent sinners) to be both one, and to give Popes one and the self-same Supream Temporal and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction? Either then they must disclaim St. Peters Keyes, or his two Swords as inconsistent; or if they will distribute the use of one of his swords to Kings and Civil Magistrates, they must by the self-same reason al∣low them one of his keyes too: And then Kings, Emperors shall both enjoy, exer∣cise Supream Ecclesiastical and Temporal Jurisdiction over the Churches, and Cler∣gy within their Dominions, by divine Right, as well as the Pope. 12ly.1 Tim. 3. 3. Tit. 1. Paul himself makes this a special qualification of a Bishop, that he must be no striker; whence Bishops and Priests claim an exemption from bearing arms, or going to war; Therefore they can neither claim nor exercise either of these two swords. 13ly. This crotchet of two swords, had its principal rise fromDe Conside∣ratione ad Eu∣genium, l. 4. St. Bernards passage to Pope Eugenius the 3d. about the year of Christ, 1146. Dracones, inquis, me mones pas∣cere, & serpentes, non oves?

Puto nec poenitebit exilii, orbe pro urbe commutato. I have transcribed his whole pas∣sage relating to both swords for this purpose; 1. To prove that the temporal sword belongs not to the Pope, but only to Christian Emperors, Kings, nor is it put into his hands. 2ly. That it is to be unsheathed for the Churches defence, when there is need, not at the Popes or Priests meer pleasure or mandate, but at the Empe∣rors and Kings special commands. 3ly. That the spiritual Sword of Priests, to be exercised by the Church, Popes, Prelates, is here expresly defined to be only the Word of God; the preaching of the Gospel with instance in season, out of season: the lifting up of Priests voyces without ceasing; crying aloud to them and sparing not, shewing the people their sins, and the house of Israel their transgressions; especially when they prove Dragons, Scorpions, obstinate, impenitent, hardning their faces, and hearts against all admoni∣tions and reproofs; In which cases, Popes, Prelates, Priests, must ingeminate, and more
boldly, earnestly, incessantly inculcate their reprehensions and exhortations, yea harden their faces against them, as they harden theirs: as the Prophets did in the old Testament; and if they continued incorrigible after all this: Go forth of Ur, leave them, resort and preach the Gospel to other Cities, as Christ himself did. This is the only Spiritual sword, and the sole drawing and smiting with it, belonging to the Church, Priests, Popes; not Suspensions, Excommunications, Interdicts, Curses with Bell, Book, Candle, not on∣ly of Private persons, but whole Churches, Kingdoms, Cities, Emperors and Kings themselves; prostrations at their Papal feet, depositions from their Crowns, losse of their Realms, absolving all Subjects from their allegiance, against former Oaths, to arm them against their lawfull Soveraigns; of which St. Bernard hath not one syllable. Therefore no appurtenances to the Spiritual sword of Popes or Priests, but meer Antichristian Usurpations, abuses, of this pretended sword, which wounds ma∣ny not to their salvation, but destruction. Finally St. Bernard presseth the Pope to use this Spiritual sword not in England, France, Germany, or other Kings Dominions; but in Rome it self, and his own Pallace, Court alone; where the people, Officers of all sorts, were generally Dragons, Scorpions, the most impudent, impenitent, brazen-fa∣ced, hard-hearted, desperate sinners of all others, of whose reformation Pope Eu∣genius and himself did almost despair. And then induced him to use his utmost en∣deavours to reform them, by the forecited smitings of them with the sword of the Spirit. And in case of their final incorrigibility; not to excommunicate, interdict, or anathematise them, but desert them totally, and by a voluntary exile to remove to some other City; to exchange Rome for the World, or any other part thereof, which was farre better then it; there to preach the Gospel, and discharge his Pastoral of∣fice, committed by Christ to Peter, and through him to himself; by seeding his sheep, which he defines only to be the preaching of the Gospel to them; concluding in these words, Evangelizare pascere est; fac opus Evangelistae, et Pastoris o∣pus implesti; Upon all which considerations, I hope the most zealous Pontificians will henceforth be satisfied; That the Civil and Spiritual swords have not their di∣stinction, distribution, nor any foundation at all on Peters single sword, or the other Apostles two material swords; and that the only spiritual sword belonging to Popes and the Church, is not their usual Ecclesiastical Censures, thunderbolts, but the meer word of God incessantly preached, applied in season and out of season to all sorts of sinners, especially the most obdurate; wherewith the City and Court of Rome are so stuffed, that Popes have most reason to brandish this sword, and all other swords or keyes they claim from St. Peter, only there, not in other Princes, Bishops Dio∣cesses and Dominions, much lesse against Emperors and Kings themselves. 2ly. If St. Peters, the Apostles, Priests and Ministers commissions forecited will neither warrant, support their Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction challenged, preten∣ded to, much lesse will their several Titles do it. Before I enter upon the Positive Titles given to them in Scripture, I shall desire you to take notice, 1. That neither St. Pe∣ter, nor any other Apostle, Minister, or Presbyter, is ever once stiled by Christ or any Apostle in relation to his office; either a King, Prince, Caesar, Lord, or the higher Powers; but only earthly Kings and temporal Magistrates.De Planctu Eccles. l 1. Ar∣tic. 52. Alvarus Pelagius, the Popes Grand Advocate, doth not only ingenuously acknowledge, but renders these folid reasons for it: First, because Kings and Lords do frequently abuse their Regal and Lordly power to tyranny and great oppression of their Subjects; which Popes and Clergymen would be likewise apt to do, if dignified with these Titles. 2ly. Be∣cause the name of a King aliquando superbum sonat, and is apt to puff men up with pride and arrogance; therefore inconsistent with the humility and meeknesse of Christs Disciples, Ministers. 3ly. To put a distinction between Civil and Ecclesiastical Governors. Inter spirituales & temporales Reges sicut est discretio in potestatibus, sic debet esse in nominibus. Principes ita{que} seculares nomen Regis quod commune est, sibi a proprietate retinent, praesertim quia ante constitutionem spititualium Regum, officium Regis & nomen plures habuisse leguntur. Principes autem spirituales aliis nominibus nun∣cupantur, quae non fastum, sed actum & pietatem insinuant. Et propter hoc ait Petrus, Pastoribus Ecclesiae, 1 Pet. 5. 2. 3. & 95 Distinct. Esto. Neque ut Do∣minautes in Clero: & Christus dixit Discipulis Lu. 22. Reges Gentium dominatur eorum, vos autem non sic. & Mat. 20 Yea he draws this memorable inference from hence. Et secundum hoc videretur dicendum, quod licet Christus sit Rex & Sacer∣dos, tamen ejus Vicarii scilicet Apostoli & eorum successors, non sunt Sacerdotes
et Reges, imo solum convenit eis potestas Sacerdotalis vel Pontificalis ex, concessione Christi. Si autem aliquibus eorum convent potestas Regia, hoc est ex concessione Principum terrenorum; sicut ex concessione Constatini habet Romanus Prontifex Imperialem potestatem, Distinct. 96. Constituimus. Which though Alvarus prima facie, grants to be rationabiliter dictum for others; yet he spends severalIbid. Ari. 51, 52, 53, 56, 57. Articles to assert, That the Pope is not only a spiritual, but temporal King and Lord, yea King of Kings and Lord of Lords; and that not only Popes, but even Bishops and Priests too have a power and jurisdiction above all Kings; Emperors, Princes in the world, even to excommunicate, depose, and put them from their Thrones, Kingdomes, Empires, as you heardHere p. 37, 38, 39. before at large. 2ly. Neither Christ, nor his Apostles after his Ascension in any of their Epistles or Gospels, ever gave St. Peter or the Pope any of these swelling Titles now claimed, or Attributed to them by their flatterers; asSee here, p. 30 37. 38. 39. Bishop Jewels Defence of the Apology, p. 59, 121, 125, 449 552, 582, 584. Christs sole Viceroy, his sole Vi∣car General on Earth, sole head of the whole Catholick Church, God, Vice-God, Christ, Christs Omnipotentiary, or Plenipotentiary, indued with a plenituds of all power both in heaven and earth, the life of the world; or any of those Titles whichDe Conside∣ratione, lib.  St. Bernard (by way of irony, censure only) gives to Pope Eugenius, as others did in good earnest; Age indagemus adhuc diligentius quis sis? quam geras, videlicet, pro tempore, personum in Ecclesia Dei: Quis es? Sacerdos magnus, Summus Pontifex. Tu Princeps Aposto∣lorum; tu Primatu Abel; Gubernatu Noe; Patriarchatu Abraham; Or ine Melchi∣sedech, dignitate Aaron, auctoritate Moyses, indicatu Samuel, potestate Petrus, unctione Christus. Tu es cui claves traditae, cui over creditae sunt. Sunt quidem & alii coeli ja∣nitores, & gregum pastores: Sed tu tanto gloriosius, quanto & differentius utrumque prae caeteris nomen haereditasti, &c. If none of these ambitious Titles were ever given by Christ or other Apostles to Peter himself in this magnificent manner or to any o∣ther Apostle; How comes the Pope now to appropriate them to himself in Peters right, who doth not own but quite disclaim them? 1 Pet. 1. 1. c. 5. 1, 2, 3. Wherefore pretermitting them as late Papal fancies, invented by Popes and their Parasites, I shall proceed to St. Peters particular Scripture Titles, peculiar to himself: whereon Popes and their flatterers bottom his and their own pretended transcendent Supremacy. The 1. is his very Sirname, Peter, Mat. 16. 18. I say unto thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church. Whence they infer,Innocentii 3 Opera, Tom. 1. p. 223. Gratian Dist. 50.

That Peter is not only supreme head of Christs Church, but the very stock and foundation on which it is built. I answer, 1. That he had this very name Peter given him either before he was called by Christ to be an Apostle, or at leastwise he was named Peter by Christ upon his very first calling to be his Disciple, Mat. 4 18. c. 8. 14, 15.

Simon Peter, joyntly, or Peter singly; Nor yet Peter himself, (who stiles himself in his General Epistle, 1 Pet. 1. 1. 2 Pet 1. 1. Peter, and Simon Peter A SERVANT and an Apostle of Jesus Christ; and 1 Pet. 5. 1. a Fellow-Elder:) ever dreamed of such a supremacy or headship, as this, or of the least Dominion or Jurisdiction over the rest of the Apostles, or Elders of the Church, much lesse over the whole Church of God, and Emperors, Kings themselves, as Popes now claim. 3ly. This name Peter, as I say unto the thou art Peter, attest, was only perso∣nal, individual, affixed to his own person alone, not transmitted to his pretended successors of Rome, whoPlatina, Onuphrius, Baronius, Dr. Barns, Lydius, Opmerus, Laertius Cherubinus, and others who wrote the Popes Lives, & Pon∣tificale Romanum. though they usually change their former Names, when ele∣cted and crowned Popes; yet not one of them ever yet stiled himself Peter, but many of them Paul; and more of them John: Therefore not one of them assuming this name Peter, and neither Christ himself, nor Peter transmitting his sirname Peter to them, they can derive no Supremacy from it to themselves. 4ly.

James; or Peter Lombard, Peter, the Her∣mit, Peter Martyr, or any other bearing that name; nor so much Peter, as Peters statue, or picture representing his pourtaicture; which may as justly claim the Au∣thority, and more rightly the name of Peter, (which they all give it) then any Pope 5ly. If this very name Peter, hath the headship, or supremacy of the Church affixed to it, then every person stiled Peter (especially if a King and Soveraign Prince) may as justly challenge the supremacy and headship of the Church, as any Pope, especially when stiled Innocent, Boniface, Gregory, Clement, or any other such name, not Peter. 6ly. St. Peter resolves,1 Pet. 2. 3. to 10. that the Lord Jesus Christ (not he) is the precious Headstone, which God hath layd in Zion, prophecied of by Isaiah c. 28. 16. & Ps. 118. 20. to whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but approved of God, ye al∣so as living stones are built up a spiritual house (or Church) an holy Priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable unto God through him; that he is made the head of the cor∣ner, and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded: Yea himself repeated it again Acts 4. 8. to 12. Then Peter filled with the holy Ghost, said, Ye Rulers of the people and Elders of Israel, be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God hath raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This (not I) is the Stone which is become the head of the corner: Here St. Peter himself twice precisely refutes the blasphemous Glosses, Inferences of his Successors to Rob Christ of his Headship, stoneship, and translate it to the Pope, through St. Peters conduct-pipe. 7ly. St. Paul who is joyned hand in hand with Peter in Popes seals, Crosiers, Bulls, Charters, yea joynt Bishop of Rome (as well as joynt Martyr with him, if he were ever Bishop there) resolves with Peter, That other foundation (of the Church and Christian faith) can no man lay, but that which is already laid, which is Jesus Christ, (not Peter) 1 Cor. 3. 10, 11, 12. And we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets (in general, not in Peter) Iesus Christ himself being the chiefEphes. 2. 21, 23. corner-stone, in whom, (not in Peter) all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. 8ly.Tract. 1. in Mat.

Non dictum est illi, Tu es Petra, sed Tu es Petrus. Ideo quippe ait Dominus; Super hanc Petram aedificabo Ecclesiam me∣am: quia dixerat Petrus, Tu es filius Dei vivi: super hanc Petram quam confessus es aedificabo Ecclesiam meam, Petra enim erat Christus: super hanc Petram quam cognovisti aedificabo Ecclesiam meam: Super me aedificabo te, non me super te. To which Authorities, & Apoc. 2: 17. (objected against the Popes Supremacy by Wickliff, his Master Gulielmus, and others) they give this pitifull An∣swer, Super Christum Petram primo & principaliter aedificatur Ecclesia: secundum vero formam Vicariam super Petrum Petram. Omnes Apostoli Petrae sunt, prae∣cipue
tamen Petrus, in quo omnes Petrae primo nomen sumpserunt; When as * Origen (from whom they draw this inference) resolves, That all the Petty Rocks of Apostles and Prophets derived their names only from Christ the Rock, not from Peter: Which rotally subverts his headship and supremacy from this Text, and Title of Peter. 2ly.

Licet enim Cephas secundum unam linguam; interpretatur, Pe∣trus, secundum alteram tamen exponitur Caput, Nam sicut caput habet plenitud∣nem sensuum, caetera vero membra partem recipiunt plenitudinis, ita caeteri Sacer∣dotes vocati sunt in partem sollicitudinis, sed Summus Pontifex (he should have said Petrus rather) assumptus est in plenitudinem potestatis: PopeEpist. 89. See Bp. Jewel His Def. of the A∣pology, p. 2. p. 125. Leo the 1. thus blasphemously writes of Peter, (intending the Pope and himself thereby) Christus Petrum in consortium individuae Trinitatis assumpsit: And thence inferres, Deus â Petro velut a quodam Capite dona sua velut in corpus omne diffudit. To all which I answer, 1. That Cephas, signifieth not a Head in any Language (as these wilfully mistake) but only a Stone, or Peter; witnesse Iohn 1. 42. (the text wher∣on they rely) When Jesus beheld Simon, he said, thou art Simon the sonne of Jonah, thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, Lapis, so some; or Pe∣trus, so others render it; and our English Translations, a Stone, or Peter, not an head. Yea the Holy Ghost himself, by St. Pauls sacred pen, gives him this Title of Cephas, (as the very same with Peter) no lesse then 5 several times in his Epistles, 1 Cor 1. 12. Every one of them saith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollo, and I of Cephas: where Paul and Apollo are put before Cephas, as they are also 1 Cor. 3. 22. 25. Whether Paul or Apollo, or Cephas, &c. all are yours. & 1 Cor. 9. 5. Have not we power to lead a∣bout a sister, or wife, as well as other Apostles, as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas; where all the other Apostles, James and John are marshalled before Cephas. Gal. 2. 5. And when James, Cephas and John, which seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fel∣lowship, that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision: Here Cephas is recited after James; and both James, Cephas and John, (the grand pillars of the Church) gave both to Paul and Barnabas, the right hand of fellowship, as their equals, neither claiming an absolute headship over them or the Church, as Popes do now from this Title Cephas, 1 Cor. 15. 5. That he was seen of Cephas (after his resurrection) then of the twelve; here only Cephas is placed before the 12. not in point of priority of order or dignity, but because heChristus cum resurrexit à mortuis prius se Petro, quam caeteris ostendit Apostolis, quia secundum Apo∣stolum visus est Cepha, post hoc undecim. In∣nocentius l. 3. Mysterium Mis∣sae pars 1. n. 8. Tom. 1. p. 321. first saw Christ at his appearance after his resurrecti∣on, before any of the other Apostles, to comfort and strengthen his soul after his tre∣ble detestable denying of Christ: Wherefore this sirname Cephas then given to Si∣mon being one and the same with Peter, and signifying not an head, rock, nor chief head-stone, or Topstone, a Title peculiar to Jesus Christ alone: and Simon Peter by this very name Cephas, being in four several Texts ranked after Paul, Apollos, James, John, and all the Apostles, it cannot prove St: Peters or the Popes headship over the Church. 2ly. Admit Cephas signified a head; yet it doth not signifie the head of the Universal Church, the head of the World, the head of Bishops, principali∣ties, powers; which Popes must prove before they pretend thereto. For 1. It is used in Scripture for the head of the natural body in a proper sence, Psal. 23. 5. 2 Kings 10. 6, 7, 8, &c. 2ly. Metaphorically; as 1.

For an oeconemi∣cal head; so the man is called the head of the Wife or woman, 1 Cor. 11. 3. c. 5.
23. 6ly. For a Spiritual supream head; so Christ is stiled the head of the Church, the head of everyman, the head of the heathen, the head of all principalities and powers, and God the head of Christ, and head over all, 1 Chron: 29. 11. Psal: 18. 43. 1 Cor: 11. 3. Eph: 1. 22. c. 4. 15. c. 5. 23. Col: 1. 10. 18. c. 2. 19. Ps. 118. 22. Mat. 21. 42. Now that Cephas signified any of these 3. last sorts of heads, the Pope must clearly demonstrate, or else renounce his headship as derived from Cephas. 3ly. PopeIn 1 Regum. l. 4. c. 4. Gregory the 1. resolves, That Paul had the priesthood of the whole world; that he be∣ing converted to Christ, caput effectus est Nationum. WhichIn Act. Apost. Hom. 3. Chrysostom thus seconds, Both land and sea, and the habitation of the whole world is committed to Paul. How then could Peter be the supreme head? 4ly. As for Pope Leo the 1. his pas∣sage, seconded by PopeExtravag. de elect. & elect. potest. Jewels Defence, p. 117 125. &c. Nicholas; That Christ hath assumed Peter into the fel∣lowship of the individual Trinity, that so God from Peter (not from Christ) as from an head might diffuse his gifts into all his body the Church; it is a most grosse daring blas∣phemy, derogatory to Iesus Christ his Headship, Offices in the highest degree, con∣tradicted by John 1. 16. Eph. 1. 23. c. 2. 21, 22. c. 4. 10, 11, 12. Col. 1. 18, 19, 20, 21. befitting only such blasphemous Pontifs who stile themselvesHere, p. 38, 39. Gods, and Vice-gods, as well as Heads. 3ly. I proceed to those respective Titles, Names given to all Apostles, Ministers of the Gospel, and their Church-offices in the New Testament, neither of which imports or transferrs to them any Supream Ecclesiastical or Temporal Jurisdiction, at least not such as Popes, Popish Prelates, Priests now claim and exercise. 1. The chief and first of all those Titles both for dignity and authority, is an Apo∣stle: St. Paul resolving, that God hath set in his Church;1 Cor. 12. 28. First Apostles: and thatEphes. 4. 11. when Christ ascended far above all heavens, he gave some (to be) Apostles, &c. the first and chiefest in order; as allIn their Com∣mentaries on the Acts, and Pauls and Pe∣ters Epistles. Divines, and Popes themselves acknowledge. Now what doth this prime title signifie or import? No jurisdiction at all, but only a mes∣senger sent by Jesus Christ into all the world to preach the Gospel to all Nations according to his mission and commission, Mat. 28. 19, 20. Mar. 16. 15. 16. John 20. 21. Acts 26 17, 18. Rom. 1. 5.  as all Divines andSee Scapula his Lexicon, Calepine, Holi∣oke, Calvin, & Riders Dictio∣ries. Dictionaries accord, is derived from the Greek word , which signifies to send in a message; Hence Mat. 11. 10. Luc. 7 27. Christ saith of John Baptist, This is he of whom it is written,Mal. 3. 1. c. 2. 7 Be∣hold I send my Messenger before thy face. Thus Phil. 2. 25. Epaphroditus is stiled Pauls Brother and companion in labour, and fellow-souldier, but your messenger; and 2 Cor: 6. 23. Titus (whom the Pope and Bishops assert to be Archbishop of Crete) and the brethren with him, are stiled Pauls fellow-helpers; labourers, and Apo∣stles, which our best Translation renders the Messengers of the Churches, and the glory of Christ: 2ly. This Title of Apostle was not peculiar to St. Peter, but com∣mon to all the 12. at first, Mat. 10. 2. Lu. 6, 13. 3ly. After Christs ascension the Title of an Apostle was given to Matthias, Paul, Titus, and some others, Acts 1. 26. Rom. 1. 1. 1 Cor. 9. 1, 2. Ephes. 4. 11. 1 Tim. 2. 7. 2 Cor. 6. 23. Gal. 2: 1. 17. 19. who were equal with, not inferiour to the other Apostles. This is the highest Title given to them through all the Evangelists, Acts, Epistles, and Apocalips: The first they stile themselves by in their Epistles: As Peter an Apostle of Jesus Christ. 1 Pet. 1. 1, 2 Pet. 1. 1. Paul called to be an Apostle, Paul an Apostle by the will of God, &c. Rom: 1. 1, 2 Cor. 1. 1. Eph: 1. 1. Col. 1. 1. 1 Tim. 1. 1. 2 Tim. 1. 1. 1 Tit. 1. 1. And their very Office in relation to this stile, is termed an Apostleship, Mission, Mini∣stry, Acts 1. 25. Rom. 1. 5. 1 Cor. 3. 2. Gal. 2. 8. Therefore no title, office of Jurisdiction. 4. In this Apostleship of St. Peter, there are these memorable circumstances subver∣ting his pretended supremacy over the rest, and whole Catholick Church. 1. That Peter was not the first Apostle by vocation, or age; forJohn 1. 37, to 40. Andrew, and another Disciple were called, and followed Christ as his Apostles before Peter; WhenceDoctrinale Fidei, Tom. 1. l. 2. cap. 1. p. 138. 139. Thomas Wal∣densis (a great asserter of his supremacy) confesseth, Petrus non dicitur Apostolo∣rum primus, primitate vocationis, sed auctoritate praelationis: Petrus non est A∣postolorum Princeps, senectute, sed potestate. 2ly. He is not alwayes first named, butMat. 16. 21, 22 23. Mar. 8. 31. 32, 33. Lu. 4. 7. 8. oft times postponed after all the disciples, and sometimes after James, John, Paul, Barnabas, (as Mar. 16. 17. 1 Cor. 1. 12. c. 3. 22. c. 9. 5. Gal. 2. 9.) 3ly. That he wasMat. 26. 31, 32, 33, 75. Mar. 14. 29, 30, 31. Lu. 22. 33, 34. more sharply, frequently reprehended by Christ then all the other Apostles, yea stiled Satan; & one that savoured not the things of God but men; 1. for disswading him from his passion. 2ly. ForMat. 26. 51. to 55. John 18. 10, 11. his arrogance, and self-confidence, That though all others should deny Christ, yet he would not. 3ly. ForMat. 14. 38. to 22. drawing his sword and cutting off Malchus
his ear without command, to prevent his passion; and doubting of Christs power. 4ly. For his peremptory refusal at first to let Christ wash his feet. 5ly. ForActs 10. 13, 14, 15. his want of faith when he be began to sink, in presuming to walk to Christ upon the sea. 6ly. ForMat. 26. 60. to the end Mar. 14. 66. to the end, Lu. 22.  to 63. John 28, 25, 26, 27. re∣puting the creatures whom God had sanctifyed and commanded him to eat (and the Gen∣tiles whom they typified) unclean, refusing to eat of them when God enjoyned him. 7ly. He more shamefully denyed his Master Jesus Christ, and that with Oathes and exe∣crations, then all the rest of the Apostles, and that thrice one after another, notwithstan∣ding Christs premonition thereof. 8ly. Christ doubted of the sincerity of his love more then of all the other Apostles, after his treble denyal of him: Whence he thrice put this question to him one after another, but to none else,John 21. 19, 26, 17. John 23. 6, 7, 8. Simon, lovest thou me? 9ly. St. Paul at Antioch withstood and reprehended Peter openly to his face, because he was to be blamed: First, for his Julaizing and complying with the Jewes: 2ly. For with rawing himself from, and refusing to at with the believing Gentiles, and that out of fear. 3ly. For his dissimulation, and not walking uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel. 4ly. For compelling the Gentiles, to live as do the Jewes. But we never read that Peter thus reprehended Paul, or any other Apostle, for any crime whatsoever. 10ly. TheCal. 2. 11, to 17. Apostles that were at Jerusalem when they heard that Samaria had recei∣ved the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and Iohn; who went unto them by their order: Therefore the other Apostles thus sending Peter, were rather Supream, then he or John thus sent by them. 11ly. WhenActs 8. 14, 15. Peter returned to Jerusalem after Cornelius his baptism & conversion, he was there publikely questioned by the Church for his going to, & eating with them which were not circumcised, & forced to make a large Apo∣logy for it, by the special command of the Spirit, and the miracles wrought among them by him. Whereupon they were satisfied. If St. Peter had been so supream as the Pope would make him, it had been a great presumption in them thus publikely to question and arraign him for his actions; when as none must now question or judge the Pope for any Crime or sinne how great soever; nor to say to him, Domine, cur ita facs? though he should send millions of souls to hell, and decree Vertues to be Vices, and Vices vertues; as theGratian Dist. 21. & 40. caus 9. qu. 3. caus. 12 qu. 2. and the Glosses thereon. Alva∣rus Pelagius de Planctu Eccles. l. 1: Artic. 4, 5. 6. Canonists, andDe Romano Pontif. l. 5. Bellarmin himself determin; He being para∣mount all Judicatories, Tribunals whatsoever, and General Councils too, as they dog∣atize. 12ly. Peter was the Apostle principally of the Circumcision only, and that not the chief, St. James residing constantly amongst them, and being Bishop of Ierusalem (as most averr) not Peter; who though he convertedActs. 10 & 1 & 8. Cornelius and his family who were Gentiles, and was sent with Iohn to Samaria, and cured Aeneas, and raised Tabitha at Lydda and Ioppa; yet we read not, that he publikely preached at Lydda, Joppa, or planted any one Church among the Gentiles, whose company he avoyded for fear of the Jewes. Hence Paul relates Gal. 2. 7, 8, 9. Now when James, Cephas, and John (who seemed to be pillars) saw that the Gospel of the uncircum∣cisim was committed unto me, as the Gospel of circumcision was unto Peter, for he that wrought effectually in him the Apostleship of the Circumcision, was mighty in me towards the Gentiles) they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go unto the Heathen, & Iames, Peter & Iohn to the circumcision. Upon which account Peter directed his first Epistle only to the scatered Iewes. Now the circumcision and Jewes being but a very small number, the least part of the world, Church, the other Apostles mission being generally to all the world, and principally to the Gentiles, of whom St. Paul was the prime Apostle,Rom. 15. 18, to 26. c. 16. 26. Ephes. 3. 3, to 12. Col. 1. 8. 27, 28, 29. Rom. 10. 18. who spread the Gospel into most parts of the world, planted many famous Churches amongst the Gentiles, and in Rome it self, to whom he directed a several Epistle, but Peter none at all, nor was ever there, for ought appears by Scripture. How Peter or Popes, can against all these particulars, with any colour of verity or ingenuity assert St. Peter to be paramount all other Apostles, undoubted head, or sole Vicar General of the whole Catholick Church, Let all Roman Catholickes resolve their consciences, and theirs who on all these grounds deny it. Yet notwithstandingAlvarus Pe∣lagius de Plan∣ctu. Eccles. l. 1. Artic. 55. f. 38, 39. Alvarus Pelagius informes us, That the Church is called Apostolical, because it is founded on the Apostles, especially on St. Peter the chief of the Apostles; That the Church of Rome is stiled, The Church of the Apostles Peter and Paul; There∣fore the Pope is Summus Rector Ecclesiae, dicitur Apostolicus, yea Apostolus in ma∣ny of his Bulls, and Canonists Glosses; & Sedes Apostolica, vocatur sedes Papalis in multis locis (of Gratian, and his Glossers there cited) Et dignitas Papalis officium Apostolicum appellatur; Et Lex Papae vel Constitutio, Apostolica instituta vocantur, &
quia Petrus & Paulus princeps Apostolorum Romanam Ecclesiam Christo Domino confir∣marunt: Et quia omnes Apostolos fuerunt fundamentum & origo totius Ecclesia militan∣tis: Et quia Papa est Vicarius illius magni Apostoli, desuper missi Christi de sinu Patris, ipse successor Petro, in quo tota Apostolica authoritas secundum pleni∣tudinem reservatur: Being all built upon the sand, since both the Title, Office of an Apostle, or Messenger, comprehend no Soveraign Jurisdiction in them. The 2d. Title given them in Scripture, even whiles they were Apostles, is Disci∣ples, and that as well after as before Christs Resurrection. This Title is given them more frequently in the Evangelists, and Acts, then that of Apostle, in many hun∣dred places: and in Mat: 28. 19. Mar: 16. 7. John 20. 18, 19, 20. 25, 26, 30. c. 21. 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14. Acts 1. 15. c. 9. 1. they are stiled Disciples after Christs resurrection, and their Mission as Apostles: This title was likewise common to them all, yea to all Christians and converts to the faith, though no Apostles, Bishops, nor Ministers of the Gospel, Acts 6. 1, 7. c. 9. 25, 26, 28. c. 11. 26, 29. c. 14. 20, 22, 28. c. 15. 16. c. 18. 23. 27. c. 19. 1, 3, 30. c. 20. 7. 30. c. 21. 4. 17. Now this Title of Disciples, common to Apostles and all Christians, carries not the least colour or shadow of any, much lesse of supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in it, but rather of subjection to the doctrine, instruction of others who instructed them. The 3d. Title, next in dignity to that of Apostles, is Prophets, and their ministry is usually stiled prophecying; Acts 13. 1. c. 15. 42. 1 Cor. 12. 29. c. 14. 3, 4, 5, 6, 22, 29. c. 11. 5. Ephes. 4. 11. 1 Thess. 5. 20. That this Title carryeth in it any Ecclesiastical or Civil Jurisdiction, especially Supream, no mortall can conje∣cture, nor any now claim, since they disown this Name. The 4th Title is an Evangelist, or Preacher of the Gospel, whose office is stiled Preaching, Ephes. 4. 11. Acts 2. 8. 1 Tim. 4. 1, 2, 5. Rom: 10. 8. 15. 25. 1 Cor: 1. 18. 2 Cor: 10. 14. And in this there is no Jurisdiction at all couched, much less Supream. This Title of Preacher,Alvarus Pela∣gius de Planctu Eccles. l. 1. Art. 62. is not peculiar to Apostles, Bishops or Priests by order, but attributed frequently to King Solomon, Ecclesiastes 1. 1, 2. stiled The Prea∣cher; The words of the Preacher, the Sonne of David, King of Jerusalem. Vanity of Vanities, saith the Preacher, all is vanity. I the Preacher was King over Is∣rael in Ierusalem. And c. 7. 27. c. 12. 8, 9, 10. He oft stiles himself. The Prea∣cher; adding, Because the Preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge; yea he gave good heed and sought out, and set in order many Proverbs: and the Preacher sought to find out acceptable words: And as King Solomon, so King David his Father, was a Preacher too; else he would not have recorded, Psal: 40. 9, 10. O Lord my God, I have Preached righteousnesse in the great congregation, lo I have not refrained my lips, O Lord thou knowest. I have not hid thy righteousnesse within my heart, I have delivered thy faithfulnesse and thy salvation, I have not concealed thy loving kind∣nesse and thy truth from the great rrgregatio. Yea other Christian Kings, asEuseb. de Vi∣ta Constantini. Con∣stantine, Beda, Mat. Westm. Ho∣linshed in his Life. Oswald, have been preachers and expounders of the Scriptures to their people upon special occasions, in default of able learned Bishops, theAlvarus Pela∣gius de Planctn Eccles. l. 1. Art. 62. See here chapter 5. principal duty of Kings being to endeavour the felicity and salvation of their peoples souls, as well as bo∣dies or estates. Thus Noah, (though no Priest by order) is stiled, a Preacher of righ∣teousnesse, 2 Pet. 2. 5. And though the office of publike preaching the Gospel was principally committed to the Apostles and Ministers of the Gospel; yet it is speci∣ally recorded,Acts 8. 1, 2, 3 4, 5. to 26. Zanct. in Act. 8. That when the Church at Jerusalem were all scattered through Pauls persecution throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the Apostles; Therefore they that were scattered abroad, (whom Zanctius the Jesuit, and Baronius too affirm to be above 15000. who were not certainly all ordaine Ministers, but Lay-men) went every where preaching the word, and converting souls in Samaria and elsewhere; which the Apostles being informed of, sent Peter and Iames from Ierusalem to pray with, con∣firm, and lay hands on those they converted, that they might receive the holy Ghost, and likewise preach the Gospel in those parts.

Upon which Demetrius (a person disaffected to Origen) writing Letters to the Bishops of Palestine, Nunquam ante auditum, nunquam factum esset, ut praesentibus Episcopis Laici concionaren∣tur; Thereupon they all, specially Alexander Bishop of Ierusalem, and Theoctyactus
Bishop of Cesarea, in defence thereof returned him this answer in writing, charging him with untruths, Quod autem in literus dixeris, Nunquam ante auditum, ne{que} iam usurpatum, ut Laici praesentibus Episcopis disputarent, Scripturasque erponerent, in eo nobis (nescio quomodo, videris) perspicue falsa dixisse. Nam ubi idonei et habiles reperiuntur qui fratribus in verbo Dei adiumento sint, a sanctis Episcopis rogantur, ut populum in verbo instituant, et per exhorta∣tiones ad populum verba faciant, et id offendiculo non est: sicut Laodiceis Evel∣pis à Neon, onu Paulinus à Celso, et apud Synodos Theodorus ab Attico, qui omnes beati et pii fratres erant, nondum Presbyterii gradu potiti, ac ve∣risimile est, illud idem in aliis locis fieri, quamvis nobis obscurum, et mini∣me cognitum.

Aedesius and Frumentius, two godly Chri∣stian Merchants trading among the Indians, occasionally preached the Gospel to them, and converting them to the Christian faith; exhorted them to meet together, and cele∣brate divine Mysteries, which they exhibited to them. Upon their return from thence, and reporting the Indians conversion to the faith by their means, Athanasius thought sit to give them Orders, make them Bishops, and send them again to the Indians for their further instruction and conversion, to compleat that work which God had so happily began by them.

Upon which ground about the year 1620. there sprang up a new order of Iesuitesses, or She-Iesuites, in Italy, Germany and other places; who took upon them to preach publikely and privately to others of their sex, and under pretext of promoting the salvation of souls, alia opera permulta sexus et ingenii imbecillita∣ti & modestiae muliebri & virginali praesertim pdori minime convenientia aggrediantur.Laertius Che∣rubinus Bulla∣riam Roma∣num, Romae 1638. Tom. 4. p. 115, 116. The scandal whereof grew so great, that Pope Ʋrban the 8. by his Bull, dated in Ianuary 1630. was enforced utterly to suppress their Congregation, Order, Houses. Pope (*) Gregory the 13. Anno Domini 1584. by a speciall Bull granted this spe∣cial Priviledge to the whole Society of the Jesuites and their Emissaries; to preach in all places without interruption, though not in Orders. Explaining and ratifying the Bull of Pope Paul the 8th. which as Gregories Bull recites, had granted them this Priviledge.

Therefore this Title of an Evangelist or Preacher, can derive no supream Jurisdiction, power to the Pope, (who seldom preacheth) or any other in and over the Church of God, since every Jesuit, though not in Orders, may preach. This Liberty of preaching indulged by this Popes Bull to Lay-Jesuits, in all places without controll, hath been one cause of the growth of such Preachers during our late Confusions, many of these disguised Jesuits having bin preachers among us; & of the prodigious increase of the Jesuites beyond all other Orders of the Roman Church, (through the extraordinary favours, assistances of the Pope, and King of Spain; they being the most active Instruments to promote the Popes Ʋniversal Monarchy over the Church, and Spaniards Universal Monarchy over the whole world,) worthy our special Observation.

October 5. 1540. their Number at first not being above 15. or 16. increasing by Degrees was ordered not to exceed 60. at most; but 3. years after the Pope left it free to Ignatius and his successors to admit so many as they pleased into their Society. Whereupon they increased so exceedingly, that Petrus Rabadeniera Anno 1608. and Aubertus Myraeus, Anno 1620. published a Catalogue of the Number of their Colleges, Houses, Cells, in all quarters of the world, and of the fellowes of their Society therein (besides their Novices and Scholars.) Their Domus Professae then (within the compasse of 80. years,) announted to 21. their Colledges to 371. their Domus professae separatae to 43. their Houses and Residentiaries to 103. in all 538. and their Socii, or Patres societatis in them to 13010. The Numbers of these Locusts being then so augmented, that Claudius Aquaviva their General boasted,Ludovic: Lu∣cius Hist Jesui∣tica l. 1. c. 7. p. 156. That he could raise an Army sooner then any Christian King: and in the time of the Vene∣tian Interdict, when Pope Paul the 8th. was in some danger, covenanted to raise him an Army of forty thousand men, upon this condition, that whosoever was slain in that war, should be reputed a martyr. In the year 1640. (being their Jubile, or 100. year from their Societies institution) they published in print new Tables of their Houses, Colleges, Cells, then printed at Antwerp, with additions to the former; wherein Ignatius was pourtrayed lying along on the ground, with an olive-tree springing out of his Loyns,Speculum Je∣suitica. p. 209, 210, 211. as the root of Jesse, spreading it self over all parts of the world, (Europe, Asia, Africa and America) with the names of every Colledge, House, Cell, in every leaf of this tree, in the Province whether its branches extended: they then amounting in the total toNota. 935.

Moreover they had then in Ireland and elsewhere 8. Colledges of Irish Jesuites; two of them at Salmantica and Compostella in Spain: in Scotland some Residences of Scotish Jesuites, who had besides two Colledges in forraign parts, the one of them in Rome it self; being so many seminaries or professed Traytors against our Kings, Church, State.In Vita Igna∣tiii Loyolae.

They having a Consistory and Council that ruled all the af∣fairs of the Kings in England: into which they never came over in those swarms, as they did during our late confusions; as Cromwell himself relates in his printed Speech, Sept. 4. 1654. p. 16, 17. and being the Heads and Lay-preachers to most of our New sects, as well as Soldiers in our late Armies, and Garisons? Their 5th. Title (whereunto all Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and that by divine right is now pretended to be annexed as inseparable, incommunicable to Kings, Tempo∣ral Magistrates, or to ordinary Priests, Presbyters, Ministers) is that of Bishop, or Overseer, and their office a Bishoprick, or good work, Acts 20. 28. Phil: 1. 8. 1 Tim. 3. 1. Tit: 1. 7. To which I answer first: That if the Supream Titles, offices of Apostles, Disciples, Evangelists have no such Jurisdiction included in or conferred by them, as is pretend∣ed, then this of Bishop or Overseer, inferior to them, can have none, at least none grea∣ter or so great as they. 2ly It is only a Title of Ministry, not of Dignity; of Labour, not Honor; of Operation not Denomination; of Watching, not Lording or loyte∣ring; as Fathers and Councils in all ages have defined: I shall present you with a short view of their resolves herein, to abate that Timpany of Ambition, pride, su∣perciliosnesse, luxury, which Popes, others challenge only from this Title of Bishop. In Mat. Hom. 13. & in Esai∣am Hom. 10. Origen (within 220. years after Christ) resolved, Qui Principatum desiderat Eccle∣siae, debet fieri omnium servus in humilitate servili, ut obsequatur omnibus in his quae perrinent ad salutem, & haec docet nos sermo divinus. Ecclesiarum Princi∣pes. Principum mundalium imitatores esse non debent, sed imitari debent Christum accessibilem, & mulieribus loquuentem, & pueris manus imponentem, & discipulis suis pedes lavantem atque tergentem, exemplum eis dantem, ut & ipsi similiter faciant suis fratribus. Neque enim ad Principatum Ecclesiae ve∣nit qui salvari vult, etsi praeest; sed ad servitutem Ecclesiae. Et si o∣portet discere de Evangelio, Principes quidem Gentium dominantur eis, & qui potestatem habent in illis, Magistratus vocantur; vos autem non sic. Qui vocatur ergo ad Episcopatum, non ad Principatum vocatur, sed ad servitutem toti∣tius Ecclesiae. Si vis credere de Scripturis, quia in Ecclesia servus sit omnium, qui praeset. Propter quod ait Apostolus: Ita nos existimet homo ut ministros Christi & dispensatores mysteriram Dei. Peccat autem in Deum quicun{que} Episcopus, qui non quasi conservis servus ministrat, sed quasi Dominus. Fre∣quenter autem et quasi amarus Dominus dominans per vim: similis constitutus Egyptiis, qui affligebant vitam filiorum Israel vi, &c. De Dignitate Sacerdotis, l. 4. St. Ambrose resolves, Nisi bonum opus amplecturis Episcopus esse non potes; a Bishoprick being not a Dignity or Dominion, but a good work, &c. St. Chrysostom Hom. 11. in Ephesios, Non dominamur, ait, fidei vestrae, thus resolves. O Dlecti, nec Domini more haec imperamus. Doctrinae verbi praefecti sumus, non est nobis mandatus Magistratus, nec data Auctoritas. Consi∣liariorum admonentium locum tenemus. Opus Imperfectum in Matth. Hom. 35. Principes Gentium dominantur eis, &c. Christus fructum hu∣militatis terrestris posuit, primatum caelestem: et primatus terre∣stris fructum posuit confusionem caelestem. Quicunque ergo de∣siderat primatum caelestem, sequatur humilitatem terrestrem: qui∣cumque autem desiderat Primatum in terra, inveniet confusionem in coelo: ut jam inter servos Christi non sit de Primatu certamen,
nec festinet unusquisque eorum, quomodo aliis major appareat, sed quomodo omnibus inferior videatur. Conversatio igitur melior est desideranda, non dignior gradus. Principes autem Ecclesiae fiunt, ut serviant minoribus suis, et ministrent iis, quaecunque acceperunt, ut suas utilitates negligant, & illorum procurent: ut si opus fuerit neque mo∣ri recusent pro salute inferiorum suorum, sicut Apostolus dicit: Ego autem impendar, & superimpendar pro animabus vestris. Si haec ergo ita se habent, Primatum Ecclesiasticum concupiscere neque ratio est, neque causa, quia neque justum est, neque utile, as he there proves at large. Denique ipsi honores in Christo in prima quidem facie videntur honores, revera autem non sunt honores diverū, sed diversa ministeria. St. Hierom thus back him,Ad Nepotian. Epist. 2. c. 19. Illud etiam dico, quod Episcopi Sacerdotes se esse overint, non Dominos: honorent Clericos, quasi Clericos, &c. Vnus Domi∣nus, Epist. 3. ad Heodo. c 7. unum Templum, unus sit etiam Ministerium. Recordemur semper, quid Apo∣stolus Petrus praecipia Sacerdotibus, Pascite eu, qui in vobis est, gregem Domini; neque dominantes in Clerum, sed forma facti gregis.

David Blondellus, with many more have demonstrated in peculiar Treatises against the Ʋsurpations of Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops over Ordinary Presbyters, Priests, Ministers, People, by a pretended Divine Right, not derived from Christian Kings, or Princes; from whom alone all their Episcopal Jurisdiction and Courts are or ought to be derived, as the Statutes of 37 H 8. c. 17. & 1 E. 6. cap. 2. and other Acts resolve. The 6th. Gospel Title given to them, is that of Elder, or Presbyter; 1 Tim. 5. 1. 19. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2. 2 John 1. 3. John 1. Tit. 1. 5. Jam. 5. 14. Rev. 4. 10. Acts 10. 17. c. 15. 2, 4, 6, 22, 23. c. 16. 4. Acts 21. 18. c. 23. 14. Which being the same in substance with that of Bishop, hath no supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, but only a directive, not coercive Authority or dominion included in it, as St. Pe∣ter resolves, 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3. The 7th. Title given them, is that of2 Cor. 5. 29, 20, 21. Embassadors for Christ, to whom he hath com∣mitted the word of reconciliation, beseeching men as if God did intreat them (by their Em∣bassy) to be reconciled to God, who hath made Christ to be sinne for us, who had no sinne,
that we might be made the righteousnesse of God by him. But this supplicatory Office, carrying no Jurisdiction, but beseechings and intreatings along with it, derives no Ec∣clesiastical Jurisdiction at all, (much lesse Supream) to any who enjoy it; and its the same in substance with the Title of an Apostle. The 8th. Title is that of a Minister, a Minister of God, a Minister of Christ, a Mi∣nister of the Gospel, by whom we believe; given to Apostles, Bishops, Elders, and all o∣ther dispensers of the Gospel, Acts 26. 16. Rom. 15. 16. Ephes. 3. 7. c. 6. 21 1 Cor. 3. 5. c. 4. 1. 2 Cor. 3. 6. c. 6. 4. c. 11. 23. Col. 1. 7, 23, 25. c. 4. 7. 1 Thes. 3. 2. 1 Tim: 4. 6. Whence the office is stiled a Ministry, Ministration, and Ministring, 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9. c. 4. 1. c. 5. 18. c. 6. 3. c. 9. 13. Rom: 12. 17. Eph. 4. 12. Col. 4. 17. 1 Tim: 1. 12. 2 Tim. 4. 5, 11. Hebr: 8. 6. Now as this Title was attributed to the Priests, Le∣vites, and others in the Old Testament, without any Jurisdiction. Ezra 7. 24. c. 8. 17. Ps. 103. 21. Ps. 104. 4. Isay 61. 6. Jer. 33. 21. Ezech: 44. 11. c. 45. 4, 5. c. 46. 24. Joel 1. 9, 13. c. 2. 17. Heb: 8. 2. So it signifies nothing but a servant, and their of∣fice but a meer service, without the least appurtinent of Jurisdiction, Soveraignty, Power, Dominion over those to whom they are Ministers; as is evident by Matth: 20. 16. Mar. 10. 43. Luke 4. 20. Acts 13. 5. Exod 24. 13. 2 Cor. 3. 4. c. 9. 1. Heb: 1. 14. 1 Pet. 4. 11. Ezech. 44. 11. 15, 16, 17. 27. and sundry other Texts. The 9th. Title is the same in effect with that of Minister, to wit,Rom. 1. 1. c. 16 2 Cor. 9. 17. Col. 4. 12. Tit. 1. 1. Lu. 16. 1, 2, &c. A Servant of Je∣sus Christ, servants of the Church, & their servants for Jesus sake; Pauls usual stile in his Epistles, and Peters and Judes in their Epistles. Now as this Title is usually given throughout the Scrpture to every Christian, servant, and other Ministers of the low∣est rank; so it imports only inferiority and subjection to their Lords and Masters, not Soveraignty or Jurisdiction inconsistent in and with a servant, Mat: 20. 27, John 13. 16. Mat. 24. 50. c. 25. 21. Alvaus Pe∣lagius de Plan∣ctu Eccles. l. 2. Artic. 13. Pope Gregory the 1. being the most humble, was the first Pope who (out of humility) stiled himself not only a Servant, but, Servus servorum Dei, in all his Let∣ters, by whose example other succeeding Popes gave themselves this Title of hu∣mility, which was inserted into their antient Lawes and Decrees, but not in their new, as Alvarus Pelagius observes; who informs us, That the Pope stiles himself thus, because he is the servant of Peter and Paul; and that he is called a Servant, 1. Because he makes himself the servant of all, (like Paul) that he might gain all. 2ly. Propter laborem & sollicitudinem quam sustinet pro omnibus, sicut Servus. 3ly. Quia si∣cut per Servum acquiritur Domino, sic per Papam cuilibet Ecclesiae potest acquiri. But this Servus servorum is now asserted to be, Rex Regum, & Dominus Dominorum. And that whichCaus. 1. qu. 3. & Distinct. 73. St. Bernard thus decried;De Consid. . 2. Absit à te, Nunquid hoc, quia Summus Pontifex, ideo summus? hoc enim illorum est, qui dignitates virtutes putant. Augustis relinquito illam sententiam, aliisque qui divinis coli honoribus non timent, viz. Nabuchodonosor, Alexandro, Anticho, Herodi; is now become the Popes usual darling Title, which occasioned these two Verses: Gloss. in Gra∣tian caus. 1. qu. 7. Alvarus Pe∣lagius, l. 2. At. 13. Servierant tibi Roma prius Domini Dominorum: Servorum servi NUNC TIBI SUNT DOMINI. The 10th. Title is1 Cor. 5. 1, 2. 1 Pet. 2. 10. Lu. 12. 42, 43. Tit. 1. 7. Lu. 16 1, 2, &c. Stewards, and dispensers of the mysteries and manifold graces of God, and their office is stiled a Stewardship, to give the houshold and their fellow ser∣vants their meat in due season; not to beat, abuse, domineer over, or enslave them. Now a Steward being but a servant, imports not the least dram of Jurisdiction or Dominion. The 11th. is that ofHebr. 5. 1. c. 8. 3. c. 9. 9. c. 10. 38. Priest, (which Protestants allow of as a contract of Pres∣byter, but utterly disallow as used by the Church of Rome, for a sacrificing Priest) unlesse in respect of such spiritual sacrifices of Prayer, Prayse, Alms, & offring up our own souls and bodies to God;Rom. 12. 1. Eph. 5. 2. Phil. . 18. c. 2. 17. Now this Title in this spiritual sence, is common to every Christi∣an, as well as to Popes, Bishops and Presbyters: Witnesse 1 Pet. 2. 9. But ye are a chosen generation, a Royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, &c. (as all the Elect and Saints of God are there stiled) Rev. 1. 4. 7. where St. John writes thus to the 7. Churches in Asia. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his bloud, and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God his Father. Rev. 5. 9, 10. Those whom Christ had redeemed with his bloud out of every tongue, language & Nation, sing this New song unto
him that sits on the throne, Thou art worthy, &c. For thou hast made us unto our God, Kings and Priests; Rev. 20. 6. Blessed and holy is he, that hath part in the first Resurrection, on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be Priests God and of Christ. From which Texts,In Exhortat: ad Castitatum. Tertullian thus argued. Nonne & Lalci Sacerdotes sumus? Regnum quoque nos et Sacerdotes Deo & Patri suo fecit. In Luc. 1. St. Ambrose resolves, Omnes filii Ecclesiae Sacerdotes sunt.In Malach. c. 1. St. Hierom de∣termines, Genus Sacerdotale & Regale sumus omnes, qui baptizati in Christo, Christi censemur nomine. WhichIn 2 Cor. Hom. 3. St. Chrysostom thus backs, Et tu in baptismo, & Rex essiceris, & Sacerdos, & Propheta: adding, St. Peter calls the whole Church of Christ, A King∣ly Priesthood.In Evang. . 1. c. 10. De Civit: Dei, l. 20. c. 10. St. Augustin concludes, Hoc Sacerdotio Regali, consecrantur om∣nes pertinentes ad corpus Christi, Summi & veri Principis Sacerdotum: Omnes sunt sacerdotes, quia membra sunt unius Sacerdotis: YeaReges sunt & Sacerdotes omnes electi. Senten∣tiae, f. 113. St. Bernard,Marlorat, Calvin, Fox, Beza, &c. Bp: Jewels Defence of the Apology, part: 1. c. 11. divis. 4. 5. p. 113 114. most Commentators and all Protestant Divines from these Texts resolve, That every faithfull Christian is after a spiritual and ghostly manner, both a Priest to offer up spiritual Sacrifices unto God, and likewise a King, to rule over his sins and corruptions. Therefore Mr. Hardings inference from this Text of Peter, That the Pope being a Bishop, may be a King, But on the other side, a King may in no wise be a Bishop or Priest. That the Priest∣hood which is the greater, may contain the Kingship being the lesse; but not è converso, And Dormers inference thence: You are a Kingly Priesthood, as who should say, the Priesthood before was not Kingly; for that their Kings (under the Law)Here, Fol. 40. Bishop Jewel, ib. p. 711 712, 713, 714. ruled over Priests; but now is the Priesthood Kingly, for that to it be subiect even Kings themselves; So that unlesse the Pope, yea every Popish Priest may rule over Kings and Princes as their Lords paramount, and that in Temporals as well as Spirituals, and all the world at their pleasures, they think they are no Kingly Priestood) must needs vanish into smoak; since not only every Christian King, but private Christian, is as much; as really a Spiritual Priest and King too, by St. Peters and St. Johns re∣solutions, as the Pope, or St. Peter himself: Especially if we believeDe Potest. Re∣gali, & Papali, c. 18. Johannes de Parisiis his decision; Sacerdotium dicitur Regale, a Regno, non hujus mundi sed coeli; and the Glosse onDistinctio 10. Gratian, from St. Cyprians resolution; Christus actibus propriis & Dignitatibus distinctis potestates utriusque discrevit. Hinc est argumentum, (as the Glosse resolves) quod Papa non habet utrumque gladium; or at least it eviden∣ceth, that every private Christian being both a Spiritual King and Priest, hath both swords as well as the Pope; who upon this account can have no superiour Spiritual or Temporal Jurisdiction over them, sinceGratian Dist. 65. Par in parem non habet Imperium. To cloze up this Chapter, I can discover (upon serious disquisition) nothing in all or any of the Evangelical Commissions or Titles given to the Apostles or Ministers of the Gospel, that can invest St. Peter, or any other Apostle, Pope, Bishop, Presbyter, Minister, Priest, with Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction or Dominion, much lesse advance the Pope to such a transcendent superiority over the whole Church, all Bish∣ops, yea Emperors, Kings themselves, as now they exercise, prescribe, expect by their very Caeremoniale, wherein they inform us;Caeremoniale Romanum. l. 3. c. 2. Papa nemini omnino mortalium reverentiam facit assurgendo manifeste, aut Caput inclinando, aut detegendo. Such is his Antichristian pride: But on the other side, the Emperor himself when he is to be crowned by the Pope,Sacrarum Caeremoniar: l. 1. sect. 5. c. 3. 6. Bp.

Moreover the Emperor himself, like a Groom of the Popes Stable, or Footman, must hold the Popes stirrop, and lead his horse, (as Pepin did to Pope Stephen, and Frederick to Pope Hadrian, and as Constantine the Great did to Pope Silvester, if we credit Mr. Harding.) If more Kings be present, then the more worthy King must lead the Popes horse on the right side, and the other on the left. And if he be not pleased to ride, then four of the greatest Kings (whereof the Emperor to be one, if present) must bear the Popes chair on their shoulders, and the Pope sitting therein. At his feast: the Emperor, or greatest King, must bring water to wash his hands; they must carry the first dish of meat and set it on his Table. At his Coronation, two Cardinal Deacons must hold up the sides of his Pluviale, or loose upper Garment; and the Emperor, or in his absence, two of the chiefest Kings must hold up the tayl thereof. If they happen to offend the Pope, they must dance attendance barefooted
at the Popes gates, asLambert. Scaf∣naberg. p. 249. Abbas Usperg. p. 235. Sabelli∣cus Aeneid. lib. 9. lib. 3.

Or else suffer the Pope to trample on their necks, asNauclerus ad Anno 1177. Cent. Magd. 12. c. 7. col. 1070, 1071, 1072. Pope Alexander the 3d. did on the neck of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, justifying this his proud insulting over him, by a blasphemous wresting of this sacred Text, Thou shalt tread upon the Adder and the Basilik. And when the Emperor replyed, He shewed this humility, Non tibi, sed Petro; this insolent Pope retorted, et Mihi et Petro: YeaPolychron, l. 7. c. 26. Centur. Magd. 12. col: 1071. Caelestine the 3d. when he crowned Henry the 3d. Emperor, and had set the Imperial Crown on his head, which he bowed down to him, the proud Pope sitting in his chair, Statim pede in terram excussit, presently struck the Crown off his head with his foot to the ground; designans per hoc, quod ipse Papa haberet potestatem coronandi Imperatorem, si meruerat, & dejiciendi si demeruerit.Summa, pars 3.

Therefore he learned this humility and prostration not from this good Angel, but the Apostate Angel the Devil; whoMat: 4. 8, 9. usurped a power to give all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, to Christ, if he would thus fall down unto him and worship him, as Kings and Emperors do to the Pope; who though he stiles himself Servus servorum Dei in his Epistles, yet displayes himself to be Greg.

Art. 1. c. 3. sect. 8. Thomas Waldensis, (a great Patron of the Popes Supremacy) Petrus sicut in Apostolatu primus erat, sic etiam in humilitate. I wish Popes (who pretend themselves to be St. Peters successors, disclaiming all their premised Luciferian Ceremonies, Services, Exorbitances) with all other Bishops and Clergy∣men, may from henceforth demonstrate themselves to be Christs real Disciples, Apo∣stles, successors, exceeding all others in humility, by preaching, diligence in the Mi∣nistry, not in the usurpation of such Ecclesiastical Authority, for which they have nei∣ther precept nor president in the Gospel, as the premises demonstrate. I shall cloze up this Chapter with St.De Consid. lib. 2▪ Bernards words to Eugenius, which I cordially desire all ambitious Popes and Prelates seriously to consider: En quis es: sed noli oblivisci etiam, quid? Quid desinas intueri, quod non desiisti esse? Hoc ergo consulo; con∣sideres maxime, quod maximus es; hominem videlicet, quod & natus es.

BOOK I. CHAP. V. That Gods principal end and intention in ordaining Kings and Su∣pream Civil Magistrates in the world, was not the bare external administration of Justice between man and man, the protection of their Subjects from violence, oppression, the preservation of them in wordly peace, plenty, prosperity; the punishment of Malefactors, rewarding of well-doers, encouragement of Arts, Virtue, Trade, indu∣stry, or fighting their battels in times of War against Invading Ene∣mies; though considerable parts of their Regal Office and Sove∣raign Authority: But the advancement of Gods Honor, Worship, Service, Glory, and spiritual Kingdom, whose Vice-royes they are; the suppression of all Idolatry, blasphemy, sinne, wickedness, the promotion of the eternal salvation, felicity of their people, and to be Kings for the Lord their God, by advancing his interest all they can. Vpon which ground (in order to effect these ends) God himself, as well under the Gospel as Law, hath delegated the Su∣preme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction only to Kings and other Soveraign Temporal Potentates; not to Popes, Bishops, Priests, who are sub∣ordinate to them as their Subjects, not Copartners with them in their soveraign Ecclesiastical Authority in point of Interest; nor yet in its actual execution, no further then they are pleased by their Laws and Commissions to delegate it to them as their Substitutes. With a specification of the chief particulars wherein this Supream Ec∣clesiastical Power of Christian Kings and Emperors consists. THE Grand Engin by whichGregorius 2 Epist. 7. Ste∣phani 7 Epist.

Quod Politia Christiana est una, et ejus est u∣nus Princeps regens eam; et quod iste primus et supremus Prin∣ceps est Summus Pontifex, qui est Monarcha Ecclesiasticus. The clearing of this Proposition will give a fatal and final overthrow to all these Papal, Pontifical Sacerdotal Paradoxes, and Pretences; In Order thereunto, I shall desire you to take special notice of whatAlvarus Pela∣gius, l. 1. Artic. 40. Alvarus Pelagius confesseth, asserteth; Quod Politia unius Civitatis est Politia unius Principatus, nec possunt esse plures Principes Regentes in una Civitate. Quod omnes illi qui eodem signo & charactere, consignantur, & eis∣dem legibus eiusdem Legislatoris subjiciuntur, ad eundem Principem pertinent. Quod omnes Christianae Religionis, sunt eiusde Principatus, &c. Quod Principatus civilis non distinguitur a Principatu Ecclesiastico, sicut una species ab alia, sed sicut partes integrales unius Principa∣tus, &c. Nec potest dici, quod Christiani sunt unius principatus quantum ad spiritualia, & alterius quantum ad corporalia & temporalia, quia nullus Princeps vel Subditus Christia∣nus potest aliquid licè possidere vel acquirere nisi in eo qui militat sub Principatu Chri∣stiano. Ex quo liquido patet, quod civilitas Christiana et politia et quantum ad spiritualia, et quantum ad temporalia ad eundem Prin∣cipatum pertinet. Et hoc clamat tota sacra scriptura, quod sumus
omnes Christi fideles una communitas et unus populus, nos et nos∣tri profecto qui nos sectantur; una enim fides, unus Principatus, et una Ecclesia collectio fidelium, Eph. 4. Vio autem quod politia Ecclesiastica sit una, tunc facile est videre, quod unus est Princeps regens et di∣rigens eam, quia pluralitas Principatuum non est bona, ut dicitur 13 Metaphysic. In una ergo politia, unus Princeps, ut preca in a∣pibus, quia diversitas Principatuum, divisio regni et politiae est, t materia guerrae et divisionis, Mat. 12. Lu. 11. Omne regnum, &c. Caus. 25. qu. 2. Si ea: Nec poteit dici quid sit unus Princeps in ratione , & in ratione agenus et moventis: quia icut declaratur 2 Metaphys. in quo ge∣nere causae oporter unum primum dare ad quod omnia posteriora reducantu: Et ita oportet in Principatu Christiano esse unum priorem Principm regentem et moventem sive gubernantem totam politiam. Prae∣terea pouere plures Principes non subalternos regentes et moventes eosdem subditos, unum videlicet ratione spiritualium, et alium ra∣tione temporalium, est facere ordinem illius politiae incounerum, et non stabilem; quia interdum contingit Principem corporatium prae∣cipere pugnare, & Principem spiritualium prohibere illum pugnam, ut tota die con∣tingit inter Christianos. Ista ratio opme probatur 19. Dist. ita Dominus. Con∣tingit etiam illos duos Dominos et Principes eodem tempore pracipere diversa; ut unus praecipet  ad agrum, alius ad ecclesiam, quae in eodem tempore non possant fieri; quia nemo potest duobus dominis servire, Mat. 6. & Luc. 16. ubaudi contrariis. Quare sequitur ordinem, talis politiae esse inconnerum et non stabi∣lem, quod est inconveniens. Hoc etiam potest manifestari e uni∣tate finis: Omnes enim de civilitate Christiana ad eundem finem, et sub eadem ratione ordinantur, scilicet ad gratiam, charitatem & unita∣tem, quae sunt vincula perfectionis in via, Col. 3. Eph. 4. Et ad finalem beaticudinem in patria ubi est illa unitas de qua Psal. 121. de que Augustinus; non erit ibi aliqua invi∣dia disparis claritatis, ubi in omnibus regnat unitas charitatis: & e qua Gregorius, Tanta vis charitatis omnes sibi ibi assci, ut bonum quod quisq e in se non accepit, in a∣lio se gaudeat accepisse: Sed cuilibet uni sini correspondet, unum age dirigens in finem illum; plura enim agentia distincta specie et natura, non habentia ordinem ad manum, non possunt dirigere ad unum fi∣nem sub una ratione. Ergo in civitate, Christiana debet esse un primus Princeps, dirigens emnes ejusdem politiae ad finem propri∣um ejus. Et sicut unus homo (secundum Augustinum) primo crea∣tus est, ut in eo et ex eo constitueretur una creatura, ut Caus. 33. qu. 5. Ita unus rector principalis totius illius naturae, qui cam deducat ad unum Deum qui creavit eum, Gen. 1. Thus far his reasons are solid; evidencing the Supream Government of Christ over the whole Church, where∣of he, not the Pope, is the head, to be incommunicable; & the government of every par∣ticular visible Church on earth in each kingdom, to be vested only in one King, & So∣veraign Prince, not in the Pope, Prelats, Clergy, or divided between them both, and quite subverts his conclusion thence: Quod  primus & supremus Princeps est Summus Pontifex; especially if compared with his Passages inDe  Ecclesiae, l. . c. 62. another Article, de∣fining the greatest good, eternal happinesse and be  not wordly glory, wealth great∣nesse, to be the chiefest end, aim and reward of all good Kings; where he thus describes the duty, office of a King: Quid sit Regis officium? &  Regem? Quantum ad officium, ita sit Rex in Regno, sicut ratio in corpore et anima, et sicut Deus in mundo: quae si diligenter consideret Rex, ex altero in eo justitia accenitur, dum considerat ad hoc se pum, ut loco Dei iudicium in re∣gno exerceat (Caus. 24. qu. 5. Regum) ex alro vero clementiae & lenitatem acqura, dum  singulos qui suo subsunt regimini sicut propria Augustinus ad Marcellinum Comitem, ple Christiane Judex pii Patris officium, sic succensere iniquitati memmeris, ut non in peccatorum acrocitatibus exerceas ulc∣cendi libidinem, sed peccatorum vulneribus curandi adhibeas voluntatem: no per∣dere
pater diligentiam quam in ipsa inquisitione servasti. Officium autem principale Regum est (mark it) dirigere suum regimen in finem bonum, qui est beatitudo aeterna: Ʋnde sic debent suos subditos in hoc mun∣do peregrinos regere,Nota. ut efficiantur Cives et Domestici Dei, Eph. 2. Qui  in corpore peregrinamur a Domino, 2 Cor. 5. Sed quia finem divinae homo non consequitur per virtutem humanam sed divinam, quia gratia Dei , Rom. 6. perducere ad illum ultimum finem, non est humani per se regi∣minis, sed divii. Ad illum ergo Regem hoc pertinet principaliter, qui non solum est homo, sed etiam Deus, scilicet Dominum nostrum Je∣sum Christum, qui homines Dei filios faciens, in coelestem gloriam introducit, propter quod non solum Sacerdos sed et Rex in sacro eloquio nomi∣natur. Hier. 23. This then being the principal end, office of Kings, according to my Proposition, I now proceed to evidence the truth thereof, which will appear, 1. By Col. 1. 16. For by him (Jesus Christ) were all things created, that are in hea∣ven, that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be Thrones, or Do∣minions, or Principalities or Powers, all things were created by him, and for him, that is, to promote his honor, glory, kingdom, Gospel, worship, interest. Compared with Rom. 11. 36. For of him, and through him, and to him are all things. Rev. 4. 11. Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour, and power, for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure (or service) they are and were created. Prov. 16. 4. The Lord hath made all things for himself (that is, to set forth his glory, service, worship, praise, Isay 43. 7. 21. Ps. 95. 6, 7.) Therefore much more Kings: who as they reign by him, Prov. 8. 15. upon that account they should and ought prin∣cipally to raign and rule for him, his glory, worship, service, & their subjects salvation. 2ly. By Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. Let every soul be subject to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God: tho powers that are are ordained of God, &c. Do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same. For he is the Minister of God to thee for good, (that is, for thy eternal good and salvation, as well as temporal good,) but if thou doest that which is evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the Minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil, (to reclaim him from his evil, and others by his punishment) thereby to bring him and others to repentance, and save their souls; as Chrysostom, Haymo, Theophylact, Paraeus, Willet, Grotius, Soto, with other Commentators on the Text, and Grotius, De Jure Belli & Pacis, lib. 2. cap. 20. de Poenis, resolve: 3. By 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. I exhort therefore, that first of all supplications, pray∣ers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made, for Kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may live a quiet and peaceablelife in all godlinesse and honesty; for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who would have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. The chief end of Kings and Magistrates institution by God, being to advance godlinesse in and among all their subjects in the first place, and then quietnesse, peace, honesty in the second. 4ly. By Rev. 21. 24. Where St. John describing the glory and beauty of the hea∣venly Jerusalem, to wit, of Christs Church and its glory under the Gospel; subjoyns, And the Nations of them that are saved shall walk in the light of it; and the Kings of the Earth do bring their Glory and Honor to it: this being the principal end for which they were made Kings, to contribute all their Regal Honor, Power to enlarge the bounds of Christs Church, kingdom; promote Gods honour, worship, glory, and salvation of the Nations, people committed to their Government. 5ly. Natural Parents, as well under the Gospel asDeutr. 6. 7. c. 11. 19, 20, 21. c. 32, 46. Law, are enjoyned, to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and knowledge of the Scriptures, Ephes. 6. 4. 1. 2 Tim. 3. 15. And natural Husbands are obliged, to instruct and san∣ctifie, as well as love and nourish their wives, 1 Cor. 7. 14. c. 14. 35. Therefore Kings and supream Christian Magistrates, (the Politick Fathers and Husbands of the Commonwealth) are also obliged to bring up their Children, Wives, Subjects in the fear and admonition of the Lord, to see them instructed in Gods word, and endea∣vour their real sanctification and salvation. To these Arguments, evidences out of the New Testament, I shall accumulate many more out of the Old. 6ly. That memorable Speech of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon, 2 Chron. 9. 8. (most punctual and observable to our purpose;) And she said to the King, Blessed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee; to set thee on his Throne, to
be King for the Lord thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee a King over Israel, to do judgement and justice. In which speech (even of an Heathen Queen from the very light of Nature) there are these memorable particulars: 1. That the Thrones of all Kings, are not their own, but Gods alone. 2ly. That it is God himself who sets Kings upon his throne. 3ly. That the grand end thereof is, To be Kings for the Lord their God, who hath set them on his own throne to be his Viceroyes; to promote his Glory, worship, ho∣nour, kingdom, interest in the world, (as Solomon did) and suppresse what ever is op∣posite thereunto. 4ly. To establish their Subjects, people for ever by setting up, esta∣blishing Gods true Worship, Ordinances, Statutes, Gospel amongst them, for their eternal salvation, and by executing Judgement and Justice over them, to thePsal. 101. 3. to the end. en∣couraging piety, holinesse, vertue, godlinesse, all good works, and cutting off all the wicked of the Land from the City of God, left they should corrupt others, and dishonor God by impunity. 7ly. This is most apparent by Gods primitive instituting theHere, p. 3, 4. First-born of eve∣ry Family, and Kings themselves before the Law, to be not only Kings, but Priests too, as Melchisedech and others were: And the very Romans, Grecians, with other Pagan Nations creating their Kings, Emperors (by the very light of Nature) to be their high Priests likewise, as I haveHere, p. 3, 4. formerly proved by sundry Testimonies; andDe Planctu Eccles. lib. 1. Artic. 13. 62. 66 Al∣varus Pelagius, Lyra in Gen. 14. Numb. 3. 12. & 8. 16. Bellarmin De Romano Pontifice, with other Romanists;His urisdiction Regal, Episcopal, Pa∣pal, ch. 2. Bishop Carlton, and sundry Protestants attest with one consent. Because the care of Religion and Gods worship, the instruction, edi∣fication, salvation and eternal felicity of all their Subjects souls, did principally be∣long to them, as a part of, or appendant to their Regal dignity. 8ly. This truth is at large demonstrated by all the particulars I haveHere, p. 8. to 18. formerly insisted on in the Second Chapter, relating to Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon, Asa, Jehoshaphat and Josiah; as likewise, of the Kings of Assyria, Cyrus, Darius, Ar∣taxerxes, Nebuchadnezzar, and the King of Niniveth, which I shall not repeat. All Kings and supream Magistrates under the Gospel, having the self-same authority, charge,Psal. 2. Isay. trust, to promote, preserve the purity, syncerity of Gods worship, suppress Ido∣latry, Blasphemy, Heresy, all sorts of sins against the first and second Tables; and in∣deavour the instruction, salvation, and eternal welfare of their Subjects, as they had under the Law; the ends, uses, grounds of Kingly and Magistratical institution, Go∣vernment under the Gospel, continuing still the same as they were before and under the Law, and being all moral, perpetual, not ceremonial. 9ly. This is most perspicuous by this precept given to all Kings by the King of Kings,Here, p. 30. Psal. 2. 10, 11, 12. Be wise now therefore, O ye Kings, be instructed ye Judges of the earth; Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce unto him with trembling; Kisse the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the right way. (Which they cannot do as Kings, unlesse they command their Subjects to do it likewise;) Compared with these prophecies concerning Christian Kings under the Gospel, Psalm 72. 2, 10. The Kings of Tarshish and of the Isles shall bring presents, the Kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts, Yea all Kings shall fall down before him; (and by their example and Regal authority) all Nations shall serve him. Psal. 138. 4, 5. All the Kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord, when they shall hear the words of thy mouth, yea they shall sing in the praises of the Lord, for great is the glory of the Lord. Isay 49. 22, 23. Behold I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people, &c. And Kings shall be thy Nursing-Fathers, and Queens thy Nursing mothers; they shall bow to thee with their faces toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet: Kings shall see and arise, Princes also shall wor∣ship: Compared with Isay 41. 1, 2. c. 52. 15, c. 60. 1, 10, 11, 16. c. 62. 5. The Gentiles shall come to thy Light, and Kings to the brightnesse of thy rising: The Kings of the sons of Strangers shall come unto thee, unto thee the rulers of the Gentiles and their Kings shall be brought, &c. And Psal. 148. 11, 12. Praise the Lord from the earth, ye Kings of the earth (in the first place, and then by their examples and edicts) Princes and all Judges of the earth, both young men and mai∣dens, old men and children, let them praise the name of the Lord, this being the prime end of their creation, and Gods instituting Kings, Princes and Judges in the earth, both before and under the Gospel.
10ly. This is most perspcuous by the example of Jesus Christ himself, the King of Kings, of whom as Davis, Solomon, and other forecited Kings of Judah were types, under the Law, so himself is the president, pattern for all Christian Kings under the Gospel: Now the principal end, scope of the Kingly Authority, power, of Jesus Christ, is the propagationIsay 9 2. 6, 7. c. 32. 1. to 6. Psal. 2. & 110. Mat. 25. 34. Col. 1. 13. 1 Tim. 4. 18. Hebr. 11. 28. 1. Rev. 12. 10 Jam. 2. 5. Eph 2, 1, to 22 c. 4. 10 to 19. of Gods Kingdom, Gospel, worship, glory; the destruction of the Kingdoms of Satan, sinne, and all kind of wickednesse, error, heresie, , and the conversion, sanctification, salvation, eternal beatitude of his Subjects souls, that they may reign for ever with him in his heavenly kingdom in endlesse felicity: There∣fore it is and ought to be the principal end, aym, office, duty of all Christian Kings, who are his Viceroyes, and1 John 2. 6. 2 ought to imitate his example. 11ly This I shall more specially and peculiarly evidence by some few texts and ex∣amples: 1. By Gen. 18. 18, 19. Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty Nation, and all the Nations of the earth shall be blessed in him; For I know him, that he will command his children are houshold after him, that they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do Iustice and Iudgement; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken. Abrahams  care (being then aGen. 23. 6. mighty Prince over his great and numerous family; and to become a great and mighty Nation) was, to instruct and command his children and houshold after him to keep the way of the Lord, that so they and all the Nations of the earth might be blessed in him. 2ly. By the whole Book of Deuteronomy, especially ch. 4. & 5. & 6. & 26. & 28. to 34. where Moses, (the supream Governour of Gods own people Israel) with all earnestnesse, exhorts and presseth them to keep, do and observe all Gods commandements, judgements and statutes, that they might fear the Lord their God, and love and serve him with all their heart, and with all their soul, and with all their might, they and their sons, and their sons , all the dayes of their life; that it might be well with them, and their children after them for ever, &c. This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judge∣ments; thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul; thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his wayes, and to keep his statutes and his commandements, and his judgements, and to hearken unto his voyce; And the Lord hath avouched thee to be his people, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandements; and to make thee high above all Nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor, and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken. This is the chief end of Gods instituting Kings and Magi∣strates in the earth, to make their subjects an holy people to the Lord their God. 3ly. By Joshua his last Speech and Exhortation to the children of Israel and their chief Heads and Officers before God, Josh. 23. 24. where he severally charges them, To fear the Lord, and to serve him in sincerity and truth; to put away the gods which their fathers served on the other side of Jordan, and in Egypt, and to serve the Lord their God which brought them and their fathers out of the land of Egypt, &c. Where∣upon all the people resolved and answered again and again, The Lord our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey, and they made a statute, ordinance, and covenant before the Lord to perform it: compared with Joshua 22. 11. to 34. 4ly. By King Davids manifold exhortations and precepts to his Subjects to this purpose through∣out the Psalms: especially Psalm 34. & 37. O magnifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together: O taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man that tru∣steth in him. O fear the Lord ye his Saints. Come ye children and hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it, & dwell for evermore, &c. And by his charge to his son Solomon, all his Prin∣ces, Officers, and Congregation of Isrel, 1 Chron. 28. 9, 10. Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and search for all the commandements of the Lord your God, that ye may posses this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever. And thou Solo∣mon my sonne, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind; for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth the imagination of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou shalt forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever. Seconded with this his publike prayer to God for them, 1 Chron. 29. 18, 19, 20. O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel our Fathers, keep this for ever in the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee; And give unto Solomon my Son an understanding heart to keep thy commandements, thy testimonies and statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the house for which I
have made provision: Which ended, David said to all the Congregation, Now blesse the Lord your God. And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and bowd down their heads and worshipped the Lord and the King. 5ly. By Ecclesiastes 1. 12: c. 12. 9, 10, 11. recording, that Solomon King of Israel was also a Preacher, and taught the people knowledge, and that which was upright, even words of truth, for their ever∣lasting welfare. 6ly. By 2 Chron. 15. 12. to 19. Where King Asa made the people to en∣ter into a covenant, to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart, and with all their soul: and that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death whether great or small, whether man or woman. To omit all other particular examples of this nature already touched: From these Texts it is apparent, That the primary office, duty, end of Kings, (especially Christian) is to promote the honour, worship, service, fear, love of God, true religion, eter∣nal salvation of their Subjects souls, and suppresse what ever is repugnant thereto. 12ly. That which was Gods principal end, design in creating the World it self, redeeming mankind by the bloud of Jesus Christ, and the King of Kings giving both the Law and Gospel to men, must certainly be Gods chief end, design in instituting Kings, Princes and Supream Civil Governors, the eminentest, chiefest of men, to be his Vice∣royes to rule over men of inferiour rank or quality; and the most essential, real considerable part of their Regal or Magistratical office, duty. Now Gods principal end and design in creating the world, and men, (the Lords of all other Creatures) redeeming mankind by the bloud of Christ, and giving both the Law and Gospel to them, was only this, that allIsay 43. 41. Ps. 95, & 100. Rev. 1. 5, 6. c. 4. 10, 11. c. 5. 9, to 14. 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2, 3. mankind might worship, adore, fear, honor, praise, blesse, obey, love and glorify him according to his word and will, whiles they live on earth, that Jesus Christ might rule in, and reign over them, as his kingdom, Church, Saints, and they might reign with, and enjoy perpetual felicity in, by, under him in his heavenly kingdom for all eternity, as the Scripture resolves: Therefore it must necessarily be Gods chief end, design, in instituting Kings, Princes, and Supream Civil Magistrates (the eminentest, choicest of all men) to rule over those of inferiour quality, and the most essential, real, considerable part of their Regal or Magisterial office, trust, duty; upon which Account, among others, God specially enjoyned the Kings of Israel, to have aDeut. 17. 18, 19, 20. c. 30 10. Josh. 1. 7, 8, 9. c. 23. 2. 6. c. 24 22. to 29 Neh. 8. 1, to 18. Bishop Jewels Defence of the Apology, 6 part ch. 11. divis. 3. p. 709, 710, 757. Copy of the Book of his Law alwayes in their custody, and to read therein all the dayes of their lives, the better to observe it themselves, and to enjoyn all their sub∣jects to observe, obey, and do nought against it; yea God himself with greatest ma∣jesty enacted this Royal Law by King Davids own mouth, for all Kings, Rulers to square their Government by;2 Sam. 23. 1, 2, 3. He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God; which he can never do, without taking special care to maintain, pro∣mote the true Worship, service, fear, love, obedience of God according to his word, among all his Subjects, for Gods glory, and their temporal and eternal felicity, as David did. 13ly. This I shall evidence even from the very light of nature, and practice among the Heathen Nations. Plato in his Book De Regno, asserts, That the King hath U∣niversae humanae Societatis curam; that Regia cura, ut quae principalis, in omnes homines ars est; consisting not only in this, that Rex est humanus Curator, but also Divinus Pastor over all his Subjects: That the chief care of Religion, Worship of the Gods and feeding of the people belongs to Kings, they being a kind of Priests: Quare in Egypto neque imperare licet Regi absque Sacerdotio. Sed si quis ex alio genere per vim Regnum invasit, postea tamen necesse est cum hoc genere initiari. Quin et in multis locis apud Graecos Summis Magistratibus maxima sacrificia demandata esse, quis compererit, et sane etiam apud nos non minus clarum est quod dico. Ei enim qui Rex sorte creatus est, augustissima et maxima patria vetera sa∣crificia, huic attributa esse tradunt. Hos itaque sorte creatos Re∣ges, simulque Sacerdotes considerare convenit, &c.Politic. l. 3. cap. 10. & 11. Aristotle his Scholar resolves us, that in the heroical times; Reges provinciam habebant & bellorum et sacrorum, nisi forte ad Sacerdotes attinerent: Postea autem partim quidem ipsis Regibus omittendis, partim vero populis recu∣santibus; apud quasdam Civitates sacra solis Regibus relicta sunt. Rex autem et Dux belli, et Iuder, erat rerum divinarum moderator.
And among the Romans themselves, as their Historians, and others relate; their antient King, and after that their Emperors, were both Kings and Priests, and had the chiefest hand in performing the Rites and Ceremonies of their Religion, as I See here p. 4. have proved, and shall further evidence by this passage of Cicero de Divinatione, lib. 1. Apud veteres qui rerum potiebantur, iidem auguria ferebant; ut enim sapere, sic divinare Regale ducebant; ut testis est nostra Civitas, in qua et Reges augures, et postea privati eodem Sacerdotio praediti rem religionum auctoritate rexerunt: eaque divinationum ratio, nec in barbaris quidem gentibus neg∣lecta est. To which I shall subjoyn this observation ofGenialium Dierum, l. 3. c. 27. Alexanderab Alexandro, Cum a principio urbis multa et magna sacra Reges obirent, ad quos de religione, deque sacrificiis et ceremoniis deorum Sacerdotes saepe consultum ibant, qui etiam rem divinam facientibus aderant, ne bonis auspiciis coeptum confirmatum{que} regium nomen post exterminatos Reges aboleretur penitus: neve de relictis sacris, regium nomen expeterent, longe antiquissimum rati, sacra quae penes Reges erant, alicui demandare;See Cicero, Oratio pro Do∣mo sua ad Pon∣tifices. Regem sacrificulum crearunt, qui sacrorum Rex dictus, sine regio imperio, solo nomine rex, sacra quaepenes reges erant obiret ac Ceremoniis praeesset, quem creatum aut in locum deceden∣tis suffectum, sicut reliquos sacerdotes, inaugurari oportebat. Eratque non annuum sed perpetuum sacerdotium, immune ab omni belli tumultu, Neque enim Rex sacrorum militare, stipendia facere, aut ca∣stris et Legionibus praeesse poterat, propter suspectum invisumque regium nomen; neque magistratum gerere; aut concionem habere; vel cum populo agere. Nam{que} eius potestas sola religione et templis tenebatur. Primus enim Manlius Papy∣rius ex Patricus, Bruto Consule rex creatus fuit, cui jus sacrificandi & de sacris decer∣nendi reliquerunt, eumque Pontifici maximo subjecerunt; ideo in sacris epulis, post maximum Pontificem supra Flaminem Dialem Martialem Quirinalem accumbebat. Atque licet a principio a populo crearetur ex patriciis & multis honoribus functis, post aliquot aetates a minore parte populi selectis, relatisque comitiis (quibus fiunt Sacerdotes) ex plebe creari coepit, tunc cum Maximus Curio plebeius homo rex sa∣crorum fuit, cujus uxor regina sacrorum hoc habet proprium, ut quoties sacra facit, ex malo punico virgulam quam in arculum dicunt pro infula deferat, quae omnibus cal. Junonis sacram faceret eique porcum vel agnum mactare debet in regia. Ad quem vestales virgines die constituta annis singulis ventitare, & ne sacra neglige∣rentur, quae suae fidei tutelaeque credita erant, praemonere solebant. Erat ergo te∣gis sacrorum munus quinto Idus Jan: Jano arietem immolare, diesque fastos praedi∣cere, & nefastos, sacra procurare, & quae sacrificia, sui essent ministrare. Ideo sacra facturi lanam, farra & fruges, lauros & verbenas, quaeque sacrificio opportuna sunt, regem petunt: Adeoque tam intra quam extra pomarium populi civesque, quique in agris agunt imperiti morum civilium, atque una agricolae, de sacris festisque diebus, consultum vadunt, & sacra postulant. Ipseque feriarum causas, & quid quoque men∣se faciendum, a quibusque cavendum esset, praedicebat praemonebatque. Cui hoc proprium dicunt fuisse, ut sacrificium in comitio peragat, quo perfecto nulla cunctati∣one vel mora se ex foro proripiat: quando vero divinis rebus perfectis in Comitium venit in fastis notabatur, utque Cal: Martiis fores regis sacrorum, Flaminis & Pon∣tificis maximi nova exornentur lauro, sicut Palatinae aedes & Augustae quercus virides nunquam lauros habuere. Cujus filiae ad sacerdotium Vestae invitae eligi nequeunt, nam privilegio honoris ab hoc onere immunes erant; volentes vero non vetantur. Quae autem ejusmodi sacra fuerint solis Regibus credita. This was the power, trust the antient Kings amongst the Romans had in all mat∣ters of Religion and worship of their Gods, which their Pagan Emperors enjoyed as High Priests, till they became Christians. The like power we read of in other Pagan Kings in Diodorus Siculus, Boemus de Moribus Gentium, Strabo, and Purchas his Pilgrimage, among other Nations; Hence Theodorus Gaza Thessaloniensis, (ad Alphon∣sum Regem Praefat: in Orationes de Incomprehensibili Dei Natura, D. Johannis Chry∣sostomi, quase Graeco in Latinum vertit: Operum Tom. 5. Parisiis, 1588. p. 360.) asserts, Eundem Regem et Pontificem olim fuisse accepimus,
tanquam Regis officio is fungi non posse, qui minus jura et ratio∣nes rerum sacrarum teneret, quas nosse Pontifices certe interest. Which he proves to be the practice among the Grecians, Athenians, Romans, Egyp∣tians, Jewes, (out of Josephus contra Apouem:) and likewise adds, Atque etiam Persos, Medos, Indos, gentes nominis magni, suos Reges vel ex Sacerdotium ordine facere, vel maxima familiaritate Sacerdoti∣bus devinctos habere solitos legimus: And he thereupon concludes, that though of later times the offices of Kings and Priests are distinguished, for the bet∣ter discharge of both, being over-burdensom for one person to manage; and there∣upon Quod etsi Rex minus divinam rem facit, minusque Iudex constitutus est rerum sacrarum, quas Ecclesia suo vocabulo spiritua∣les appellar, Rationes tamen nosse earum rerum, et quemadmo∣dum singula Christianae religionis debeant, minime ignorare, procul∣dubio pulchrum est, et Majestati Regiae consentaneum; since Kings themselves ought to observe them, and to take special care that all their subjects do the like, (as he there proves at large) quo plus apud eos (as it did apud te, Alphonsum) Religionis Chatitas, quam civile negotium va∣let. 14ly. BecauseBaronius An∣nal. Anno 553. num. 237. Anno 528. n. 2. Clemens Ro∣manus Constit. Apostol. l. 2. c. 38. Popes, with other ambitious Prelates, Priests and Clergy-men deny this truth, together with Emperors and Kings Supremacy in Ecclesiastical af∣fairs, to avoid mistakes, I shall briefly inform you, 1. Wherein the Supream Eccle∣siastical Jurisdiction belonging to all, especially to Christian Emperors, Kings, (exer∣cised by them in all ages, as part of their regal Office) consists; and then 2dly. evidence the truth of my Proposition by the resolutions of Fathers, Councils, Popes themselves, Popish and Protestant Divines of chiefest note, in a Chronological manner. For the First, This their Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction is reducible to these short Heads. 1.See Centur. Magd. 6. c. 7. col. 440. to 452 Cent. 7. c. 7. col. 236, 237, &c. By their royal Lawes, Edicts, (as well as examples) to maintain, establish, propagate, encourage, protect the publike sincere worship, orthodox faith, service, honour, glory, religion of the true and only God throughout their Dominions, ac∣cording to the holy Scriptures: to encourage, defend, love all the Ministers and Pro∣fessors hereof; to preserve peace, unity, concord in all Churches under them; and pre∣vent, suppresse, all Atheism, Heresie, Blasphemy, Idolatry, false or superstitious Worships, Heresies, Errors, Schisms, Profanesse, Impiety, repugnant to Gods Word. 2. To preserve inviolable all the Commandements of the first, as well as of the second Table, and punish all violations of them by Bishops, Priests or Deacons, as well as others of their subjects. 3ly. Though not to intrude, like Ʋzziah, on the Priests, Ministers, Bishops office, in administring the Sacraments, or constant publike Preaching the Gospel; yet strictly to command all Bishops, Clergy-men of what degree soever, within their Realms, dili∣gently, faithfully, constantly to discharge their Pastoral duties, by frequent preach∣ing, Catechising, Administring the Sacraments, & living answerably to their pro∣fessions; And to enjoyn all other their Subjects to frequent Gods publike Ordinan∣ces, embrace the true Religion, lives as becomes the Gospel; and to punish all their negligences, extravagances, and scandalous offences, against their respective trusts, and Christian profession. 4. To summon General, National, Provincial Councils, Synods, to make, ratifie Ecclesiastical Lawes, Canons, and constitute Courts, Commissions, Officers under them for the examination, suppression of Errors, Heresies, Schisms, and better Go∣vernment of the Church and Church affairs, when and where there is occasion. 5. To erect new Churches, Parishes, Bishopricks, divide or unite old, place god∣ly Bishops, Pastors in them for Gods publike worship; the better edification, in∣struction, salvation of the souls of their subjects, and to provide competent mainte∣nance for them. 6. To receive Complaints, decide Controversies, Differences in Religious or Eccle∣siastical matters by way of final Appeal to them; to restrain, redress all Incroachments, exactions, usurpations of Popes, Bishops, or other Clergymen, upon their Ecclesi∣astical or Civil Jurisdictions, Courts, Rights, or Subjects Liberties, by Prohibiti∣ons or other means; and promote (as much as in them lies) as well the spiri∣tual
and eternal, as temporal felicity of all their subjects. This Supream Jurisdiction of Emperors, Kings, in and over all Ecclesiastical cau∣ses, persons, as well as Secular for their spiritual good; together with Christians pro∣fessed acknowledgement of and submission to it, as well under Pagan as Christian Emperors, Kings, Governors, I shall evidence by these ensuing Authorities. Bibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 1. Colon. 1618 p: 8, 9, 10 Aristaeas ad Philocratem fratrem, informs us; That King Ptolomeus Philadel∣phus before Christs Nativity,Anno 10. demanding of Eleazar and other of the 70. Interpreters, Quonam pacto regnum incolumè in finem usque à Rege conservetur? Et quemadmodum singula juste perficere possit? quomodo recte omnia servans & illaesa, cundem filiis salvum tradat? &c. Received these answers, Si Dei mansuetudinem Rex in omnibus imitatur. Si considerat omnem sensum à Deo esse, proponatque ante omniae Dei timorem. Si non po∣tentiae suae fidat, sed Deum semper imploret, ut juste sibi agendi consilia dirigat. Si De∣um assidue imploraverit, ut rectos sibi sensus ad ea quae in posterum peragenda sunt tri∣buat, & filiis imperaverit, ne gloria divitiisque superbiant, sed arbitrentur Dei benigni∣tate sua & sermonis sui pulchritudinem principium a Deo deducat. And to this questi∣on, Quid sit in gloria Regis potissimum? He received this answer, Deum venerari, non sacris, neque muneribus, at cum animi puritate ac fide candida ejus voluntutem sequi. All this they must do not only in their own private persons, as men; but as Kings and Soveraign Rulers, by inducing, commanding their subjects to imitate their piety, ex∣amples, that they may both arrive at the same ends, temporal and eternal felicity. Epistola 10. ad Smyrnenses, Bibl. Patrum, Colon. Agrip. 1618. Tom. 1. p. 88. Ignatius Bishop of Antioch,Anno Christi, 100. (St. Johns disciple, and contemporary with the Apo∣stles) writes thus. Honorare oportet et Regem; nec enim Rege quis∣quam praestantior, nec quisquam similis ei in rebus omnibus creatis, (therefore not the Pope or Bishops, being creatures) nec Episcopo qui Deo consecratus est pro totius mundi salute, quicquam majus in Eccle∣sia. (The Emperors being then Pagans.) Nec inter Principes quisquam similis Regi qui in pace & optimis legibus subditos moderatur. Bibl. Patrum Tom. 1. p. 96 g. Polycarpus Bishop of Smyrna,Anno 120. and all the Elders with him, in their Epistle to the Philippians thus exhort them. Orate pro Regibus, & Potestatibus & Principibus (as supream Governours, though then enemies to the crosse of Christ) ut fructus vester manifestus sit in omnibus, & sitis in illo perfecti. Bibl. Patrum, Tom. 2. p. 43. G. H. Justin Martyr,Anno 150. in his Apologia secunda pro Christianis (as well Bishops and Presbyters, as believers,) ad Antoninum Pium Imperatorem; stiles him and the Senate: Ii quae praesunt, qui non vi, vel tyrannide, sed religione & sapientia ducti ferant sententiam; of Christians and their Religion: the grounds, principles, and summa∣ry whereof he relates, and refers unto his and the Senates judgements, consciences; Subjoyning, Tributa verò & census iis qui a vobis constituti sunt Vbique in primis conamur pendere,Mat. 22. quemadmodum a Christo instituti sumus, &c. Deum solum adoranus, vobis autem in aliis rebus laeti servimus, Reges{que} vos et Principes hominum esse profitemur, rogamusque ut vos cum Regali potestate sanam bonamque mentem habere inveniamini. And he concludes his second Apology in defence of the Christians and their Religi∣on, (which he submits to the Emperors and Senates Judgements) thus; Haec vo∣bis queque consideranda permittimus, ac si vobis rationi, vertitati∣que consentanea videntur, comprobate; sin nugae vobis videntur, ut verba nugarum plena contemnite, non in eos qui nullam injuriam inferunt, nec scelus admittunt, ut in hostes mortem statuite. And ends his first Apology with these words; Qua vestrum quoque erit pro Religi∣onis, Philosophiaeque dignitate, quod jus & aequum est secundum nos (Christianos) judicare. Ad Autoli∣cum, l. 1. Bibl. Patrum, Tom. 2 p: 158. D. Theophilus Patriarch of Antioch living about the year 180.Anno 180. under the Empe∣perors Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, writes thus of himself (and all Christians too) in that age, Contra Christianae Religionis calumniatores. Simulacra & Dii Gen∣tium, opera sunt quae confecit manus humana, & daemonia impurissima, &c. Quae cum ita sint, magis honorabo Regem sive Caesarem, non tamen eum adorabo, verum pro eo orabo. Deum qui verè Deus est adorabo, sciens Caesarem ab ipso esse ordinatum. Dicas ergo, Quare Regem sive Caesarem adorare recusas? Quia non ad id institutus est ut adore∣tur, sed ut legitimo, qui ipsi congruit honoretur honore. Rex enim sive Caesar, Deus non est, sed meminerit se esse hominem, a Deo in hanc dignitatem promo∣tum,
non ut adoretur, sed ut juste, quemadmodum justitia exigit, judicet. Nam Regnum, sive Imperium, rerumque administratio ipsi a Deo commissa et demandata est. Hinc Caesar, sive Rex, neminem subjectorum aut Regem aut Caesarem appellari vult. Regium enim sive Caesareum nomen ipsi soli competit, nec alius id vendicare audet. Ita adorandi cultus ne∣mini nisi Deo soli deferendus est. Regem quidem sive Caesarem honora: ho∣nora, inquam, magna cum benevolentia, subjectus ei existens, et orans pro eo. Haec faciens Dei voluntatem exequeris; Nam divi∣nae legis hic tenor est:Prov. 24. 21, 22. Honora fili mi Deum, & Regem, nec unquam eoram inobediens sis, subito enim hostes suos ulcisci possunt. Adversus Hae∣reses l. 5. p. 599, 600, 601. Ireneus Bishop of Lions in France,Anno 180. resolves and proves from Prov. 8. & Rom. 13. Non Diabolus determinavit hujus mundi Regna, sed Deus: Regis enim cor in ma∣nu Dei est: & per Solomonem, ait verbum, Per me Reges regnant, &c. Ad utilitatem ergo Gentilium positum est a Deo, sed non a Diabolo, ut timentes regnum humanum, non alterutrum se homines vice piscium consu∣mant, sed per legum positiones repereutiant multiplicem Gentili∣um injustitiam. Et secundum hoc Dei Ministri sunt, qui tributa exigent a nobis, in hoc ipsum servientes; Quae sunt potestates a Deo ordinatae sunt. Cuius enim jussu homines nascuntur, hujus jussu et Reges constituuntur, apti his qui in illo tempore ab ipsis regantur. And elsewhere he writes thus to the Roman Emperors,Jacobus Lan∣gus Notae ad Justin Martyris Oratio ad An∣ton: p. 117. Know ye, O Emperors, what is committed to you; totus orbis sub manum vestrum subditus est. Therefore the Pope and all Bi∣shops, Prelates whatsoever, are under their power. Bibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 2. p. 129, 139, . Athenagoras a famous Christian Philosopher,Anno 190. thus begins his Apologia, sive pro Christianis Legatio, dedicated to the Pagan Roman Emperors Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and Aurelius Commodus; Qui vestrum Imperium, maximi Reges, longe lateque per orbem terrarum agnoverunt, moribus & legibus inter se di∣versis degunt, &c. (worshipping their several Gods, and retaining the religions and ceremonies received from their ancestors without any restraints or penalties, under them, as he proves at large) Quid multis? Gentes & Nationes hominum passim iis, quae approbaverunt quaeque, sacris & mysteriis addictae sunt. Atque haec per vos om∣nibus licent, haec leges concedunt; ea nimirum ratione, quod nu∣men omnino tollere, scelus et impietas videatur; Deorum autem quod sibi quisque delegerit cultus, res necessaria, ut divinae justitiae metu, a malefactis abstineant mortales. Denique universus hic terrarum orbis, vestrae prudentiae beneficio altissima pace, (& Deo∣rum suorum cultu) perfruitur: Nostri tantum qui Christiani vocamur; nulla vobis cura est; sinitis enim nos, qui nihil mali patramus, imo omnium piissime justissimeque cum erga Deum, tum Imperium vestrum nos gerimus, exarari, rapi, fugari, &c. Proinde vos ob∣secramus, ut nostri aliquam curam suscipiatis, quo aliquando tandem ab hujusmodi calumniatoribus jugulari desinamus; Then declaring at large the inno∣cency, purity, allegiance, loyalty and obedience of the Christians, the truth, purity of the Deity they worshipped, and Christian Religion they professed; The vanity, impurity of the Images and Idol-gods the Gentiles worshipped, he concludes thus; Vos verò undequaque in omnibus natura simul & disciplina boni, moderati, benigni, & imperio digni Principes, mihi (obsecro) qui crimina nobis objecta dissolvi, et insuper nos esse pios erga Deum, vita et moribus honestos, animo sobrios et temperantes ostendi, capitibus Regiis annuite. Ecqui enim con∣sequentur aequius ea quae petunt, quam nos adeo vobis devoti addicti∣que? Nos enim pro Imperio vestro preces ad Deum fundimus, et ut filius (quod justissimum est) in regno olim parenti cedat, utque Imperium vestrum augeatur; denique omnia ex animi sententia e∣veniant, oramus, quod et nobis salutare fuerit, ut quietam tran∣quillamque vitam agentes, vobis interim ad quaelibet Imperata prompte inserviamus.
Ad Scapulum l. 1 p. 162, 163. Terullian;Anno 200. who flourished about 200. years after Christs Nativity, brings in all the Christians of his age, in his Apology for them, thus acknowledging the Em∣perors Supremacy over them, as well Clergy as ity; and their Loyalty, obedience, subjection to, and prayers for him. Christianus nullius est hostis, ne dum Impera∣toris, quem sciens a Deo suo constitui, necesse est ut et ipsum dili∣gat, et revereatur, et honoret, et salvum velit cum toto Romano Im∣perio, quous{que} seculum stabit: tamdiu enim stabit &c. Colimus ergo et Imperatorem sic quomodo et nobis licet, et ipsi expedit, ut hominem a Deo secundum, et quicquid est a Deo consecutum solo Deo mino∣rem. Sic enim omnibus major est dum Deo vero minor est. Sic et ipsis Diis major est, dum et ipsi in potestate sunt ejus. Itaque et sacrificamus pro salute Imp. sed Deo nostro et ipsius, sed quomo∣do precepit Deus, pura prece; Ita nos oramus magis prosalute Imperatoris, ab eo eam postulantes qui praestare potest. Which he thus seconds in his most ElegantCap. 30, 31. Apologetic. adversus Gentes; who amongst o∣ther slanders, charged them with high Treason against the Emperor, and as publike Enemies to him; whereunto he returned this answer. Ventum est ad secundum ti∣tulum laesae Augustioris Majestatis, &c. Propterea igitur publici hostes Christiani, quia Imperatoribus neque vanos neque mentientes, neque temerarios honores dicant; quia verae Religionis homines sollemnia eorum conscientiae potius quam lasciviae celebrant, &c. Insuper eos debellatis qui salutem Imperatorum sciunt petere, qui etiam possint impetrare dum sciunt petere. Nos enim pro salute Imperatorum Deum invocamus aeternum, Deum verum, et Deum vivum, quem et ipsi Imperatores propitium sibi praeter caeteros malunt. Sciunt quis illis dederit imperium, sciunt quis homines, quis et ammas. Sentiunt Deum esse solum, in cujus solius potestate sunt, a quo sunt secundi, post quem primi, ante omnes et super om∣nes Deos, homines, &c. Inde est Imperator, unde et homo ante∣quam Imperator: inde potestas ei, unde et Spiritus. Illuc suspicien∣tes Christiani manibus expansis, quia innocuis, capite nudo, quia non erubescimus, De∣nique sine monitore, quia de pectore oramus, precantes sumus semper pro omnibus Imperatoribus, vitam illis prolixam, imperium securum, domum tutam, Exercitus fortes, Senatum fidelem, populum probum, or∣bem quietum, quaecunque hominis et Caesaris vota sunt. Haec ab alio orare non possum, quam a quo sciam me consecuturum, quoniam & ipse est qui solus praestat, &c. Sic itaque nos ad Deum expansos, ungulae fodiant, cruces suspendant, ignes lambant, gladii guttura detruncent, bestiae insiliant; paratus est ad omne supplicium ipse habitus orantis Christiani. Hoc agite, boni Praesules, extorquete animam Deo supplicantem pro Imperatore. Hoc erit crimen ubi veritas & Dei devotio est.He answers this cavil. Adeo lati nunc sumus Imperatori, & mentiti vota quae diximus ad evadendum scilicet. Plane proficit ista fallacia. Admittitis enim nos probare quodcunque defendimus. Qui ergo putas, nihil nos de salute Caesarum curare, Inspice Dei voces, literas nostras quas neque ipsi supprimi omnes & plerique casus ad extraneos transferent. Scitote ex illis praeceptum esse nobis, ad redundantiam benignitatis,Matth. 5. 44, 45. Lu. 6. 27, 28. etiam pro inimicis Deum orare, & persecu∣toribus nostris bene precari. Qui magis inimici & persecutores Christianorum quam de quorum Maiestate convenimus in crimen? Sed etiam nominatim & mani∣feste 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2 Orate, inquit, pro Regibus, & pro Principibus & Potestatibus, ut omnia tran∣quilla sint. Vobiscum enim concutitur imperium, concussis etiam caeteris membris e∣jus, utique & nos (licet extranei a turbis aestimemur) in aliquo loco invenimur. Est et alia major necessitas nobis orandi pro Imperatoribus, etiam pro omni statu imperii rebusque Romanis, quod vim maxtimam Vni∣verso Orbi imminentem, ipsam{que} Clausuram seculi acerbitates hor∣rendas comminantem, Romani Imperii commeatu scimus retar∣dari. Itaque nolumus experiri, et dum precamur differri. Roma∣nae diuturnitati favemus. Sed quid ego amplius de Religione et
pietate Christiana in Imperatorem? quem necesse est suspiciamus, ut eum quem Dominus noster eegerit, ut merito dixerim, noster est magis Caesar, ut a nostro Deo constitutus. Itaque ut plus meo, plus ego illi operor in salutem, &c. Idem sumus Imperatoribus, qui et vicinis nostris. Male enim velle, male facere, male dicere, male cogitare de quoquam exaequo vetamur; quodcunque non licet in Im∣peratorem, id nec in quempiam; quod in neminem, forsitan magis nec in ipsum, qui per Deum tantus est. And Adversus Marcionem, l. 1. (who maintained two distinct Gods, and Principles of equal power) He thus determines, Summum magnum par non habere. Par autem non habere uni competit, in duobus esse nullo modo possit. Rer enimetsi summum magnum est in suo solio usque ad Deum; tamen infra Deum; comparatus autem ad Deum, excidit jam de summo magno translato in Deum. Nec inter Reges plurifarium videre potest summum magnum, sed uni∣cum & singulare, apud eum scilicet qui Rex Regum, ob summitatem magnitudinis, & sub∣jectionem caeterorum graduum quasi culmen dominationis excipitur. It being an impossi∣bility and contradiction (as he there proves at large) to have two Supream heads in one kingdom, or any equal to the King, who is only inferiour to God, the King of Kings when compared with him. Stromatum, l. 1. Opera Grae∣co-Latina, Lu∣tetiae Paris. 1641. p. 346. 347. Phil. 2. Clemens Alexandrinus,Anno Christis, 180. describing the offices and parts of a King both in times of Warre and Peace, addes▪ Regnandi autem scientiae una pars quidem fuerit divina, cuiusmodi est quae est ex Deo, et Sancto eius filio, a quibus et quae ex terra bo∣na sunt, et quae externa et perfecta suppeditatur foelicitas, &c. Finem ad pieta tem Deique cultum referens: sic enim virtute utentibus prudentia est quae ordinat; Divina autem, sapientia; politica, seu regendorum Civitatum, scientia. Rex itaque is est, qui imperat ex legibus, qui est praeditus scientia imperandi volentibus, cujusmodi est Do∣minus, qui eos qui in ipsum et per ipsum credunt admittit. Omnia enim tradidit Deus, et omnia Christo subjecit, Regi nostro, &c. Contra Cel∣sum l. 8. Ope∣rum, Basileae, 1571. Tom: 2. p. 809. Origen flourishing within 230.Anno 290. years after Christ, thus answers Celsus his ob∣jection against the Christians; Postremo hortetur nos Celsus, ut opem feramus Imperatori totis viribus, & geramus ejus auspiciis justa praque bella, neque de∣tractemus militiam si res ita postulat. Respondemus: feremus Imperatori au∣xilia suo tempore, sed divina, ut ita loquar, nimirum armatura fretos non humana. Idque facimus Apostoli monitis obedientes, cujus haec verba sunt: Obsecro vos primum ut faciatis deprecationes, orationes, interpellationes, gratiarum actiones, pro omnibus hominibus, pro Regibus & omnibus in potestate collocatis. Et quo cujus{que} est pietas major, eo majorem opem Imperatori fert, magis quam stantes in procinctu milites et occidentes quotquot possunt ex hostibus. Possumus etiam sic respondere alienisa nostra fide, & ad militiam pro Republica caedesque hominum nos urgentibus. Ecce vestrum quoque numinum Sacer∣dotes & delubrorum custodes dextras servant puras a sanguine, causa sacrorum, ut incru∣entis, in pollutisque caede manibus victimas offerant solenniter iis quos habetis pro Diis, nec ullo bello dolectos habetis e sacrificorum ordine. Hujus moris si vobis constat ratio, quanto magis caeteris militantibus, non contemnenda est nostrorum hominum militia, ma∣nus quidem puras servantium, decertantium autem fusis ad Deum precibus pro legitimo Imperatore, et pium justumque bellum gerente milite, ut destruatur quicquid est juste facientibus adversarium? Itaque precibus nostris profligantes omnes bellorum excitatores Daemo∣nes ac perturbatores pacis ac faederum, plus conferimus Regibus quam qui arma gestant pro Republica. Laboramus autem pro imperio Ro∣mano, dum inste viventes, vota pro eo facimus, exercentes jus in contem∣nendis voluptatibus, nec sinentes nos ab eis quovis pertrahi; sic nos praealiis pugnamus pro Imperatore, et licet cum ipso non militemus, habemus tamen Castra propria pietatis auspiciis, & rem deprecationibus gerimus. Et plus beneficiorum a Christianis confertur in Patriam quam a reliquis hominibus, dum Cives erudiunt ad pietatem erga Deum, tutelarem Patriae praesidem, ejusque viam ad coelestem quandam Civitatem Dei muniant, moo recte vivant vel in exiguis Civitatibus. Which holy life he concludes to be the chief end of Governors & Governments, as well as of
private Christians. And in Epist. ad Romanos, c. 13. l. 9. He asserts, that God will have all crimes whatsoever temporally punished, Non per Antistites, & Principes Ec∣clesiae, sed per mundi Judices; to whom he hath delegated the sword, as the higher powers ordained by him, to which every soul must submit: Therefore Popes and Pre∣lates, as well as others. To passe byAd Demetri∣anum Procon∣sulem p 161. St. Cyprians,Euseb. Eccles. Hist: l. 7. c. 10. Dionysius, andAdversus Gentes l. 4. Arnobius, their passages, of Christians constant Prayers even for their Pagan Kings,Anno 300. Emperors, and their kingdoms as constituted by God:De Vero cul∣tu, l. 7. c. 5, 6. Coelius Lactantius, treating of the end of the world, and mans creation resolves: Quid plenius argumentum proferri potest, et mundum hominis, et hominem sua causa Deum fecisse, quam quod ex omnibus animanti∣bus solus ita formatus est, ut oculi ejus ad coelum directi, facies ad Deum spectans, vultus cum suo parente communis sit, quasi porrecta manu allevatum ex humo, ad contemplationem sui excitasse? Propterea igitur coli se Deus expetit, & honorari ab homine tanquam Pater, ut virtutem et sapientiam teneat, quae sola immortali∣tatem parit. Idcirco mundus factus est, ut nascamur; ideo nascimur, ut agnos∣camus factorem mundi ac nostri Deum; ideo agnoscimus, ut colamus; ideo coli∣mus, ut immortalitatem pro mercede capiamus, quoniam maximis laboribus cultus constat: ideo praemio immortalitatis afficimur, ut similes Angelis effecti, summo Patri ac Domino in perpetuum serviamus, et simus aternum Deo Regnum. Haec summa rerum est, hoc arcanum Dei, hoc mysterium mundi: Yea this is the sum, mysterie, of all the Kings and kingdoms in the world, instituted by God for these only ends, that all theRev. 10. 55. kingdoms of the world might thereby become the temporal kingdoms of God, and of his Christ, on earth, and his eternal kingdom in heaven. All these recited Fathers lived under Heathen, not Christian Emperors, Kings, to whom they Addressed their Apologies, Appeals, Defences of the substance, truth of the Christian Religion they professed under them; as the highest powers on earth, the properest Judges of Religion, and bound in duty to protest both it and them in the true profession thereof. When the Roman Emperors, and other Kings became Professors, Protectors, and Propagators of Christianity, the Fathers, Councils, Bishops, Clergy and Christians under them, thus set forth their Supremacy in and over all Ecclesiastical and Religi∣ous affairs, persons, as well as temporal. To pretermit the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction attributed to, and exercised by Con∣stantine the Great,Anno 340. the first Christian Emperor, which I shall insist on in the First Chapter of the 2d. Book;Apologia ad Constantium Imperatorem. Athanasius Bishop of Alexandria, as he constantly prayed to God in publike for Constantius the Emperor, though an Arrian, with all expressions of Loyalty, duty, and dedicated a special Apology to him, in Justificati∣on both of his faith and loyalty; useth this expression therein; If I were accused to others, I would appeal to your Majesty as Paul did to Cesar; but seeing they accuse me unto you, ad quem a te appellare potero nisi ad Deum? There being none para∣mount the Emperour to Appeal to, (neither Pope, nor Council) but God alone. How this Emperor Constantius, twice removed and banished Athanasius Bi∣shop of Alexandria, and Paulus Bishop of Constantinople from their Bishopricks, and placed Gregory and George (two Arrian Bishops) in their Sees; and how upon their Complaints and Appeals to his Brother the Emperor Constans, reigning in the West, who summoned their accusers to appear before him, (which they did) they were resto∣red to their Bishopricks by the advice and decree of the Council of Sardis (Anno 350) summoned by both these Emperors Edicts, at the requests of Athanasius and Paulus, to hear and decide their cause, referred to them by the Emperors: and the special Letters of Constantius sent to Athanasius: What Creeds, or forms of Christi∣an faith both the Arrian and Orthodox Bishops compiled in the Councils of Anti∣och, Sardis, Jerusalem, Smyrna, Millain, Arimino, and Seleucia, (all summoned by the Emperors Edicts presented to the Emperors for their approbations and ratifications, as Supreme Judges, Moderators in such cases, are at large recorded in Socrates Scho∣lasticus Ecclesiast.

Only I shall recite the memorable re∣quests of the Orthodox Bishops in the Council of Arimino to the Emperor Con∣stantius in their second Epistle to him, Wherefore we humbly request your Majesty of
your gracious Favour, and wonted Clemency to accept this our Message;Socrates Sco∣st: Ecclesiast: Hist: l. 2. c: 36 in the Greek, but 22 in Me∣redith Hame his English Translation That you admit no novelty to creep into the Church of God, to the contumely of such as are already departed this life; but that you grant us your license and lawfull favor, firmly to persevere in those things which our Ancestors have decreed, in as much as it is evident to all men, that whatsoe∣ver they did, it was through well advised counsel, prudent consideration, and the aid of the holy Ghost. Also, We humbly request, that the exiled Bishops which wander in farre and foraign Regions, grievously afflicted by reason of great years, and the misery of want and necessity, may by your safe conduct return home from exile, to the end the Churches remain not desolate, and deso∣late of their Bishops being thus farr asunder. Last of all, Our hum∣ble sute is to your Majesty, that nothing may be diminished from, or added to the Old and Antient Decrees, but that all whatsoever have been observed unto this day, through the godly procurement of your Father, may henceforth be of force, strength and virtue, and that hereafter there may arise no molestation to us about those things, and that you suffer us not to be banished our Churches, &c. Ad Constanti∣um. lib. 2. Saint Hillary Bishop of Poictiers wrote thus to this Arrian Emperour Constan∣tius, Anno 356. not long after At hanasius, in the Orthodox Christians behalf. We beseech your Clemency to permit, that the people may have such teachers as they like, such as they think well of, such as they chuse, and let them solemnize the divine mysteries, and make prayers for your safety and prosperity. In which Book to this Emperor, he acknowledgeth his Supre∣macy in and over all Ecclesiastical persons, causes, though he justly censures his force imposed on them in their Councils, to make them vote against their wills, and the Orthodox faith, in behalf of the Arrian Hereticks. The Godly Western Bishops assembled by this Arrian Emperor Constantius his Edict to the Council of Ariminum,Anno 359. and there long detained by him from their Cures, wrote twoSocrates Scho∣last.

In the first they thus petitioned them, We beseech your Majesty that you cause us not to be banished, nor stayed from our Churches, but that the Bishops, together with the people, may live in peace and tranquillity, and may humbly pray for your health, kingdom and safety, in which the Divine Majesty long preserve you; Pro tua salute, Imperio prolixo. So Nicephorus renders it, but o∣thers thus. Supplicantes Deo pro pace tui Imperii pariter et salutis, quam tibi Do∣minus in perpetuum largiatur. They concluded their second Letter to him with this Supplication; For this cause we beseech your Clemency the second time, most religious Lord and Emperor, that you command us to depart to our Churches, if it so please your Godlinesse, before the sharpnesse of Winter come. That we may make our accustomed pray∣ers together with the people to the Almighty God, and our Lord and Saviour Christ for your Empire (or Reign) as we have alwayes accustomed in times past, and yet cease not to doe, and now wish to continue: Not daring to depart from this Council without his License. Gregory Nazianzen.Anno 370. Oratio 17. informs the Prince and Governour, Cum Chri∣sto Imperium geris, cum Christo munus hoc administras, Ab illo gladium accepisti, non tam ut eo utaris quam ut mineris, ut teneas. Quare tibi videndum est ut illi tanquam donarium quoddam purum & integrum ei qui dedit, serves. Imago Dei es; verum imaginem quoque Dei Regis, quae quidem hic cer∣ta dispensatione gubernaretur, ad aliam autem vitam migrat, ad quam omnes quoque con∣cedemus. Moneat te exemplar tuum; ad Deum te rejunge, non ad mundum, ad benig∣num Dominum, non ad acerbum tyrannum. Oratio 27. He thus describes the Suprema∣cy, office of Kings. Orbis universus manui vestrae subjectus est, diademate parvo, atque exiguo panno retentus. Supera solius Dei sunt, infera autem, Vestra etiam sunt. Subdi∣tis vestris Deos vos praebete;Prov. 21. 1. liceat enim audacius aliquid dicere; Cor Regis in manu Dei est, ut ex Scripturis audimus & credimus. Hic imperium vestrum sit, non autem in auro et exercitibus. Aulici proceres fidem Imperatoribus servate, sed prius Deo, propter quem his etiam quibus commissi & traditi estis. And Oratio 46.
to Nectarius Bishop of Constantinople, he exhorts him to stirr up the Emperor to sup∣presse the Apollinarian hereticks, concluding thus; ut potentissimum Imperatorem do∣ceat, nihil et reliquo ipsius erga Ecclesias studio rediturum esse utili∣tatis, si tale malum ad fidei sanae eversionem per eorum libertatem, licentiamque praevaleat. St. Basil the Great, Bishop of Caesarea, Homil. in Psal. 32. Non servatur Rex per multam virtutem;Anno descants thus: Non exercitus militaris quantavis munitio, non civi∣tatum moenia,370.Operum Graeco at. Parisiis, 1638. Tom. 1. p. 180, 181. non peditum phalanx, non equestris turma, non navalis muniminis praepara∣tio Regi salutem parit. Dominus enim Reges constituit, et destituit, sive transfert, & nulla est potestas, nisi a Deo constituta. Servatur ergo Rex non per multam virtutem, sed per Dei gratiam. Therefore it should be his principal care to serve, please, obey, honor God, promote his glory; and make his kingdom, Regnum supra omnes Princi∣paum, peccato minime obnoxium, as he there defines a kingdom. Optatus Milevetanus resolves,Anno 370. Super Imperatorem non est, nisi solus De∣us qui fecit Imperatorem.Lib. 3. contra Parmenianum. And justifies his authority to suppresse and punish the Donatists with death it self, for their heresie, schism and sedition. St. Ambrose resolves,Anno 370. Apologia Davi∣dis, l. 1. c. 4. 10. That Kings are exempted from human punishment, Tuti Im∣perii potestate, as having no Superiors to punish them. And in his Oration, De Exi∣tu, Ʋita & Virtutibus Theodosii Imperatoris, he gives him this applause. Quis splendidius Pascha celebravit, quam qui sacrilegos removit errores, clausit templa simulacra destruxit? In hoc Josias Rex superioribus antelatus est. Manet ergo in lumine Theodosius, & sanctorum coetibus gloriatur. Constantinus quod primus Impera∣torum credidit, & post se haereditatem fidei Principibus dereliquit, magni meriti locum reperit, cujus temporibus completum est illud Propheticum, In illo die erit quod supra frenum est,Zech. 14. sanctum Domino omnipotenti, &c. Then turning his Speech to the Emperor Honorius, he adds, Denique ideo te Imperatorem pater fecit, Dominus confirmavit, ut non solum militares Patri, sed omnibus imperares; stiling him, Totius orbis Imperatorem. In his 29. Epistle to Theodosius, he hath this passage of his suppressing the Valentinian Hereticks. Quis habet Valentinorum haeresin vindicare? quam pietas tua quomodo vindicat, cum eos excludi jusserit, nec conveniendi usur∣pare copiam? Si Joslam tibi objiciam, regem Deo probatum, hoc in illis damnabis quod in illo probatum est. And in his 30. Epistle to the Emperour Valentinian, be∣seeching him not to suffer the destroyed Altars of the Gentiles (upon their Petition to him) to be repaired by his decree. He resolves, Cum omnes homines qui sub ditione Romana sunt militent Imperatoribus timorem at{que} Principibus, tam ipsi vos Omni∣potenti Deo et sacrae fidei militatis, aliter enim salus tuta esse non poterit, nisi unusquis{que} Deum unum, hoc est Deum Christianorum, a quo cunctaregun∣tur veraciter colat.Psal. 115. 4. Ipse enim solus verus est Deus; Dii autem Gentium daemonia. Huic igitur Deo vero quis{que} militat, & qui intimo colendum recipit affectu, non dissimulati∣onem, non irreverentiam, sed fidei studium, et devotionis impendit. Postremo, si non ista consensum saltem aliquem non debet colendis Idolis & prophanis Caeremoni∣arum cultibus exhibere. Haec si jam sublata non essent, auferenda suo imperio com∣probarem.

He likewise presseth the necessity of all Christian Bishops, Churches, Peoples publike prayers for Kings, and chief Temporal Magistrates, as well Pagans as Christians; then ge∣nerally used in all Churches. And although he hath two or three Passages seeming to oppose the Emperors Supreme Jurisdiction in causes Ecclesiastical; in the case be∣tween Auxentius the Arrian Bishop, and himself, at whose request the Emperor willed the case in difference might be heard in an Ecclesiastical Assembly, and that the Emperor himself might be Iudge, whether St. Ambrose ought to yeeld up his Church to this Arrian Bishop upon the Emperors command?De Vocatione Gentium l. 1. & in 1 Tim: 2.

Et Benedictus dominus noster Jesus Christus Unigenitus Dei fili∣us, qui regnum vestrum sua pietate custodit, apud quem gratias agimus vobis Clementissimi Trancipes quod et fidei vestrae studium probavistis, qui ad removendas alterca∣tiones congregare studuistis Sacerdotale Concilium.

In his Lyturgy he hath special Collects Pro Augustissimis et Deo-deditis Regibus nostris. And he gives us this account of the duty of a King,Tom. 5. col. 1145, 1157, 1140. Nam is demum vere Rex est, qui iram, qui invidiam, qui voluptatem cohibens omnia sub Dei Lege agit, mentem liberam servans, neque patiens voluptatum dominationem animo suo imperitare. Talem equidem Regem libens viderem, et po∣pulis, et terrae, et mari, et Civitatibus, et exercitibus jura dantem. Quisquis enim animi affectibus rationem Magistram praefecerit, is parvo admodum negotio ex hominibus, una cum divinis legibus praefeci possit, ut eundem patris lo∣co subditi habeant, cum omni mansuetudine Civitatibus consuetudinis suae copiam fa∣cientem. Qui vero hominibus imperare quum videatur, irae tamen avaritiae, volup∣tibus servit, hic primum subditis suis ridiculus videri possit, hoc ipso quod Coro∣nam quidem gestat gemmis auroque intertextam, temperantiae vero corona mini∣me insignis est, & purpureo quidem paludamento toto corpore fulget, animum au∣tem inornatum habet. Synesius,Anno 410 in his Book De Regno, dedicated to Arcadius the Emperor, Resolves; Religio autem et pietas firma imperatoris et regis hasis subjiciatur,De Regno ad Arcadium, Im∣peratorem, p. 8, 9, 19, 20. in qua stabile atque inconcussum simulacrum perstet, nec unquam basi

St.Anno 420.Contra Epi∣stolam Prme∣niani l. 1. c. 7. & Epistola 16 Bishop Jew∣els Defence of the Apology against Har∣ding, part 6. ch. 9. divis. 1, 2. p. 695, 696, 697. Augustin Bishop of Hippo records; That the Donatists being condemned by an Assembly of Bishops in Africa, appealed for relief to the Emperor (Constantine) who by special Commission appointed Miltiades then Bishop of Rome, and others, to be Judg∣es of the Controversy: Who being condemned before the Pope and other Delegates, they appealed again from their sentence to the Emperor; who there∣upon turned them over to be judged by the Bishop of Arle in France with others. Who passing sentence of condemnation against them likewise; they thereupon appealed in the last place, to the Emperors own person, complaining of the partiality of the Bishop of Rome, and of Arle in their former sentences, at whose hands they could find no Iustice; In the end, they were heard and condemned by the Empe∣ror himself, & then found themselves also grieved with his definitive Imperial sentence, condemning his judgement as they had done the former. Hereupon St. Augustine thus replyed upon and answered them; An forte de Religione non est ut dicat Imperator, vel quos miserit Impera∣tor? Cur ergo ad Imperatorem Legati Vestri venerunt? Iudex eli∣gitur Imperator: Iudicans contemnitur Imperator. Therefore St. Augustine condemned them (as did the Emperor and all others) for impudent, perverse Wranglers, who would not submit to any Judgement or order, crying out against them: Quid amplius vultis homines? quid vultis amplius? In which passages there are sundry memorable particulars: 1. That the schismatical Donatists themselves appealed to the Emperor Constantine against the sentence of an whole Assembly and Council of African Bishops, as paramount them. 2ly. That the Emperor by his Com∣mission made Pope Miltiades, not alone, but with other Bishops, joynt Commissi∣oners, to hear and judge this Cause by vertue of his Commission only, (not of his Papal or their Episcopal Jurisdiction) which they accordingly pursued. 3ly. That they appealed against the sentence of the Pope himself, and these Bishops as unjust, to the Emperor, as paramount them. 4ly. That he on the 2d. Appeal delegate the Examination of this Popes and his Colleagues Judgement, to the Bishop of Arie and others; which they confirmed. 5ly. That thereupon they appealed to the Temperors own personal and final Judicature, who passed Judgement against them. 6ly. That though they disliked his Judgement, yet they appealed not from it, there being no Superior Judge in Ecclesiastical causes above the Emperor, but God him∣self. 7ly. That both St. Augustine and the Donatists by their appeal, reputed the Emperor the properest, yea highest Judge in all Ecclesiastical causes & controversies. St. Aug. further relates: That Felix Bishop of Aptingita (a Donatist) ad Constantini iussionem Proconsularibus gestis fuisse purgatum: whereupon, ait quidam (of the Donatist Hereticks,) non debuit Episcopus Proconsulario judicio purgari; quasi vero ipse hoc comparaverit, ac non Imperator ita quaeri jusserat, ad cujus Curiam, de qua rationem Deo redditurus esset, res ea maxime pertinebat. To which St. Augustin: replyed, Si criminis non est provocare ad Imperatorem, non est criminis audiri ab Imperatore: Ergo nec ab illo cui causam delegaverit Imperator, &c. His resolution therefore was, that the purgation of a Bishop belonged specially to the Emperors charge, though a meer Ecclesiastical matter. The same Father informs us,Contra Petil∣lianum Don. l. 1. c. 83, 84. Gratian caus. 23. qu. 4. Con∣tra Donatistas & Celsionem, c. 17. Contra Cresconium Grammaticum, l. 3. c. 42, 43, 44 Epist. 48. & 50 Retractio∣num, l. 7. c. 2 That this Emperor made se∣vere
Lawes against these heretical and schismatical Donatists, to suppresse their errors, schisms, meetings: which being duly executed, reclaimed many of them from their heresie and schism. Upon which experience S. Augustin altered his opinion, concerning the unlawfulness of punishing Hereticks with corporal punishments, or death, to reclaim them, In hisTom: 8. pars 2. p. 819. 637, 638, 852.

He proves at large from Mat. 22 17. Luke 13. 1. Tim. 2. That all Christian whatsoever ought to be subject to Kings, to pay tribute to, and pray for them, though heathens and persecutors. In his Enarratio in Psal. 137. on these words. Confiteantur tibi Domine omnes Reges terrae; Sed & ipsi cum tibi confitentur cum laudant te, non terrena desiderent à te. Quid enim Reges ter∣rae desideraturi sunt? Nonne am habent ipsius imperium? Quid amplius potest? Altior sublimitas necessaria est. Sed fortasse quanto altior, tanto periculosior est. Ideoque reges quanto sunt in majore felicitate terrena, tanto magis humiliari Deo debent. Ʋt quid faci∣ant? Quoniam audierunt omnia verba oris tui, & cantent in viis Domini, quoniam magna est gloria Domini. Cantent in viis Domini Reges terrae. In quibus Domini viis cantant? De quibus supradictum est: In misericordia tua & veritate tua, quoniam uni∣versae viae Domini misericordia & veritas. Non ergo sint Reges terrae superbi, sed humi∣miles sint. Tunc cantent in viis Domini, si humiles sint, ament & cantabunt. Canticum novum pertinet ad hominem novum. Ambulent ergo & Reges terrae in viis tuis, ambu∣lent & cantent in viis tuis. Quid cantent? Quoniam magna est gloria Domini, non Re∣gum. Vide quomodo Reges voluit cantare humiliter in viis Domini, non se extollentes adversus Dominum. He elsewhere resolves how Kings do serve the Lord even in taking care of things belonging to God and Religion.Contra Cres∣conium, lib. 3. c. 9. In hoc Reges Deo serviunt, sicut eis Divinitus praecipitur, in quantum sunt Reges, si in suo regno bona jubeant, mala prohibeant: non solum quae pertinent ad humanam societatem, verum etiam quae ad di∣vinam Religionem. Quomodo ergo Reges Domino serviunt in timore, nisi ea quae contra iussa Domini fiant religiosa severitate prohibendo atque plectendo? Aliter enim servit quia homo est, aliter etiam quia Rex est.Ad Bonifaci∣um Tom: 2. 50 Epist: Gra∣tian Distinctio, 9. Quia homo est, ei servit vi∣vendo fideliter; quia vero etiam Rex est servit leges justa praecipientes, et contraria prohi∣bentes, authoritate sanciendo. Servit Deum ut Ezechias; & templum restaurando, &c. and as King Josiah and Nebuchadnezzar after his restitution, and Darius did, &c. Quicun{que} ergo legibus Imperatorum quae pro Dei veritate feruntur, attemperare non vult, acquirit grande supplicium. Nam à temporibus Prophetarum omnes Reges qui in ppulo Dei non prohibuerunt, nec everterunt, quae contra praecepta Dei fuerunt instituta, culpantur; & qui prohibuerunt & everterunt, super aliorum merita laudantur. Quando autem Imperatores pro veritate contra falsitatem constituunt bonas leges, tenentur servientes, & corrigentur in∣telligentes, &c. And, De quaestionibus Novi & Veteris Testamenti, cap. 13. Non nescivit David divinam esse traditionem in officio ordinis Regalis.  Saul in ea∣dem adhuc traditione positum honorificat, ne Deo injuriam facere videretur, qui his ordini∣bus honorem creavit. Dei enim imaginem habet Rex, ut Episcopus Christi: Whence our English Apostle,In Theatro Militantis Ec∣clesiae cap. 33. Thomas Wal∣densis Doctri∣nale fidei, Tom 1. lib. 2. Artic. 3. c. 75. John wickliff, thus argued the Kings superiority above the Popes or Bishops, Quod Episcopus est Vicarius Christi secundum humanitatem, REX AUTEM EST DEI VICARIUS: Dignior ergo Vicariatus incumbet Regi quam Episcopo. Christus ordinavit seculare brachium per potentiam coacti∣vam; esse Divinitatis Vicarium, dando ei gladium corporalem; & ordinavit Sa∣cerdotium esse humanitatis Christi Vicarium, patiendo, et ipsum in humilitate et tribulationibus imitando, ut docet Augustinus in loco multiplici. To which Thomas Waldensis replies, Ecce jam habis Regem imaginem Deitatis, sed ut per gladium quem accepit. Solum Dei servis humana ministret. Ecce habes quod Rex si Divinitatis imago, non tantum qualiter omnis homo est imago Dei, a primordialis creationis effectu, sed speciali etiam praerogativa potestatis ac∣ceptae, et Regiae dignitatis intuitu. Ad quid putas? ad dispensan∣dum humana, ut supra dixit Gregorius. Regnas regno Christi quae sunt humana dispensare. Sacerdos est imago Christi, et cujus Christi? Nonne Dei hominis? et quid efficiens? nonne divi∣na dispensans? Pluris ergo est, ut nulli est dubium, imago Christi Episcopus dispensans divina, quam Deitatis Vicarius, vel Imago Rex dispensans humana. As if God himself, whose Image and Vicar a King
is, were only and principally imployed about human affairs, not divine: Now if God himself doth most of all, in theMat. 6. 25, to 34, Psal. 78. 70, 71, 72. very first place mind, intend, command, promote his own worship, service, glory, divine things, and the salvation of mens souls; then certainly Kings, who are his Image, Vicars, must do so too, or else they were nei∣ther his Image, nor Vicars, but most unlike unto him: Wherefore God called David from the Sheepfold to the Throne for this very end,Ps. 78. 70, 71, 72. 2 Sam. 5. 2. 1 Chron. 11. 2. & cap. 29. John 21. 15, 16 17. Acts 20. 28 To feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance; as well as Peter or Bishops to feed his sheep and flock; who thereupon fed them according to the integrity of his heart, especially with heavenly instructions, exhortations, prayers, precepts, Psalms; and guided them by the skilfulnesse of his hands, by setting up Gods publike worship, Ark, Temple, amongst them, as theHere, p. 12, 13. premises evidence; to which St. Augustine here principally referrs; and so Waldensis his eva∣sion, conclusion is most absurd, and Wickliffs position orthodox. The Bishops convened in the Council of Aphrick,Anno 418. (whereof St. Augustine was one) cap. 25. to 35. 42, 51, 59, 60. resolved,Surius Concil. Tom. 1. p. 577, 578, 579, 581, 582. Crab & Binius. That the Emperors Honorius & Theodosius should be petitioned and requested by them 1. A Religiosis Imperatoribus postulan∣dum, ut Reliquias Idolorum per omnem Aphricam jubeant penitus amputari, & templa eo∣rum jubeant omni modo destrui. 2. A religiosissimis Imperatoribus postulan∣dum, Petendum etiam, ut statuere dignentur, ut nullum ad testimonium dandum Eccle∣siastica cujuslibet persona pulsatur. 3. Illud etiam petendum, ut quae contra praecepta divina convivia multis in locis exercentur, quae ab errore Gentilium attracta sunt, &c. pro∣hibeantur. 4. Necnon et illud petendum, ut spectacula Theatrorum caeterorum{que} luorum die Dominica, vel caeteris religionis Christianae diebus celeberrimis amoveantur. 5. Et illud petendum est, ut statuere dignentur, ut si quis cujuslibet hominis Clericus Iudicio E∣piscoporum quocunque crimine fuerit damnatus, non liceat eum sive ab Ecclesiis quibus praefuit, sive a quolibet homine defensari, interposita poena damni, pecuniae atque honoris, quo nec aetatem, nec sexum excusandum esse praecipiant. 6. Et de his etiam petendum, ut si quis ex qualibet iudicra arte ad Christianitatis gratiam venire voluit, ac liber ab illa macula permancre, non eum liceat, a quoquam iterum ad eadem exercenda reduci, vel cogi, 7. Ab Imperatoribus universis visum est postulandum, propter afflictionem paupe∣rum, quorm molestiis sine intermissione fatigatur Ecclesia, ut defensores eis adversus po∣tentias divitum cum Episcoporum provisione delegentur. 8. Simul etiam petendum, ut illam legem quae a religiosae memoriae eorum Patre Theodosio, de auri Libris Decem in ordinatores, vel ordinatos Haereticos, seu etiam in possessores; (ubi eorum congregatio deprehenditur) promulgata est, ita deinceps confirmari praecipiant, ut in eos valeat, contra quos propter eorum insidis Catholici provoca contestatione a deposuerunt. Ut hoc saltem Terore Schismatica vel Haeretica pravitate desistant, qui Consideratione aeterni suppli∣cii emendari corrigique dissimulant. 9. Petendum etiam, ut Lex quae Hereticis vel ex Donationibus, vel ex Testamentis aliquid capiendi vel relinquendi denegat facultatem; ab eorum quoque pietate hactenus repetatur, ut eis relinquendi vel sumendi jus adjuvat qui pertinacie furore caecati in Dona∣tistarum errore perseverare voluerint. Caeterum illis qui consideratione Unitatis et pacis se corrigere voluerint, absque Interdicto hujus Legis capiendae Hereditatis aditus pateat, si adhuc in Erroris Haeretico constitutis aliquid ante donationis vel hereditatis obvenit his sane exceptis qui lite pulsati, putaverunt ad Catholicam transeundum: quia de talibus credibile est, non metu caelestis Iudicii, potius quam terreni commodi aviditate, unitatem Catholicam praeoptasse. To obtain all which Petitions and Lawes, this Council dispatched their particular Legates to these Pious Emperors, with these their joynt requests; for most of which they published particular Laws, recorded in the Codes ofLib. 1. Cod. Tit. 4. &c. Justinian andLib. 16. Cod Tit. 1, to 8. Theodosius. Theodoret,Anno 430. Bishop of Cyprus informs us; Romanum Imperium (everso Macedoni∣co) orbis terrarum claves tenet (not St. Peter, or the Pope.)In Danielem Oratio 2. Ope-Tom. 1. p. 394. Romanum Imperium non periisse cum Salvatoris ortu; siquidem Augusto regnante, Dominus in lucem editus est; secundus quidem ille regnavit. Omnes autem, (ut ita dixerim) homines suae ditio∣nis subiunxit,Luc. 2. omnemque terrarum orbem (ut evangelii testantur) descripsit, tributumque imperavit.Tom. 2. p. 27. Regnum igitur Romanorum, quod illo obtinent viguit, us∣que adhuc permansit. Therefore the Pope and Romish Prelates were then all subject to, not paramount the Emperor, as he resolves in his Interpretatio in Epist. ad Ro∣manos, c. 13. Omnis anima potestatibus sublimioribus subdita sit; Sibi est Sacer∣dos
aliquis, sive Antistes, sive monasticam vitam professus, iis cedat quibus sunt mandati Magistratus. Clarum est autem si cum pietat; non autem si Dei praecep∣tis repugnent. Magistratibus parere praecipitur. Potestates enim à Dei providentia a∣pendent. Ipse enim communis ordinis curagerens, efficit, ut hi quidem imperarent, illi vero parerent, veluti quoàdam fraenum iis qui se injustè gerunt, Magistratuum timorem incutiens. Porro autem sciendum est, quod et Magistratum gerere, eique parere a divina providentia pendere: for the ends mentioned by the Apostle. And in his Expositio in 1 Tim. 2. & Tit. 3. 1. He presseth praying for Heathen and wicked Kings, Magi∣strates, that they may become Christians; and obedience to all their lawfull commands by all sorts of Christians. St. Cyrill,Anno 430. the famous Bishop of Alexandria,Operum Tom: 2. Parisiis 1608 p. 673. begins his Book (ad Theodosium Re∣gem pientissimum, Devota in Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum fide) thus, A Deo, cujus est summa Celsitudo, Vobis, Christianissimi Reges, humanae claritudi∣nis fastigium, incomparabilibus excellentiis prae omnibus aliis ex∣surgens et exaltatum, eximiaque & excelsa sors sunt data, dignus nimirum super terram honor. Etenim illi quidem omni genu flectunt, thronique & Principatus, dominatio∣nesque ac potestates servam submittunt cervicem, & decentibus illum semper colentes glorificationibus, plenum esse dicunt coelum & terram gloria ejus. Viderit autem quis et in vestra Serenitate decorum et evidentem tam illustris et omnium summae Nobilitatis Typum. Vos enim estis (not the Pope) et summorum dignitatum fontes, et supra omnem eminentiam, hu∣manaeque felicitatis principium et origo. Et vestrae quidem Maje∣statis clementissimis nutibus, quicquid Regni soliis substractum est, ut vitam legitimam et admirabilem agat, gubernatur; at qui jugum non ferunt, facile a vestro robore victi, cadunt, &c. vel Regis genibus misericordiam quaerunt. Ea propter vobis mundum subjecit, &c. Tam pii et praeclari vestri Imperii summum praesidi∣um est Dominus noster Iesus Christus.Prov 8. Nam, per iilum Reges reg∣nant, & potentes scribunt justitiam. Distribuit autem prompte diligentibus se omnia quae laudabilia, & admirabilia, ac eximia. Ad haec quae dixi demonstranda, sufficiunt, vel ea quae vestrae Majestati donatae sunt, & adhuc danda, ut credimus. Quod autem gloriosa in Deum pietas Regus honoribus immobile sit fundamentum, eti∣am ex ipsa sancta divinaque Scriptura dicere attentabo; which there he doth: Therefore to advance Religion, piety, and Gods glory, the unmoveable foun∣dation and stability of kingdoms, is, and ought to be the principal part, care of Kings and their Kingly office, as he inferrs.Anno 431. These most great and most religious Emperors,Cyrilli Opera Tom. 2. p. 22. epistola. 17. Theodosius and Valentinian in their Epistle to this St. Cyril, wherein they summoned him to the Council of Ephesus, con∣firm this truth. A pietate quae in Deum est, reipublicae nostrae constitutio pendet, et multa utrinque est cognatio, et societas. Cohaerent enim inter se, et altera alterius crescit incremento, ita ut vera religio ju∣stitiae studio, respublica vero ab utrisque adjuta, resplendeat. In regnum itaque a Deo constituti, et connexio pietatis ac prosperitatis subditorum existentes, societatem horum perpetuo indivulsam custo∣dimus, ac providentia nostra pacem inter homines procurantes, hac∣tenus quidem reipublicae augendae ministramus: per omnia vero sub∣ditis, ut ita dicamus servientes, ut pie vivant et conversentur, si∣cut pios decet, adornamus, utriusque ut convenit, curam gerentes. Neque enim fieri potest ut alteri studentes, non similiter ut alteri∣us curam geramus.Nota. Prae caeteris in hoc incumbimus, ut Ecclesia∣sticus status, et qui Deum deceat et nostris temporibus conveniat, firmus permaneat, tranquillitatem{que} ex omnium consensu retineat, sitque per Ecclesiasticarum rerum pacem quietus, et pia religio servetur irreprehensibilis; eorumque vita qui ad clericatum et mag∣num Sacerdotium delecti sunt, ab omni sit culpa libera. Cum au∣tem
ista intelligeremus cum per dilectionem erga Deum, tum per animum, veritatis amantem in iis qui pii sunt, obtinere posse jam quidem saepenumero eorum gratia quae commodum inciderunt Deo dilecttissimam omnium eorum qui ubique sunt sanctissimorum E∣piscoporum Synodum necessariam esse duximus, verum cunctatores per molestiam pietatis ipsorum improbitatem facti sumus. At ur∣gens jam necessitatem cum Ecclesiasticarum tum publicarum dis∣ceptatio, et summe profuturam et irrecusabilem illam esse ostendit. Quapropter ne quae tam utilium rerum quaestionem concernunt, si negligantur in pejus dilabantur, id quod a temporum nostrorum est pietate alienum, curabit pietas tua ut post imminens sanctum Pascha volente Deo, circa Pentecostes diem ad Ephesiorum Asiae Civitatem adveniat; et paucos, et quos probaverit ex Provincia sibi subjecta sanctissimos Episcopos, ad eandem Civitatem conve∣nire faciat, ut nec qui sanctissimis Provinciae tuae Ecclesiis suffi∣ciant nec qui concilio sint accomodi, desint. Sunt, enim Exempla∣ria a nostra Majestate de praedicta sanctissima Synodo Dilectis per Vniversas Metropolcis Episcopis, scripta, ut hoc facto, et per∣turbatio quae ex controversiis istis, accidit, secundum Ecclesiasti∣cos Canones dissolvatur, et quae indecenter committuntur corri∣gantur, sitque et pietati erga Deum, et publicis rebus commoda firmitudo; nec aliquid quacunque in re ante Sanctissimam Syna∣dum, et futuram illius communem sententiam, a quoquam sepe∣ratim innovetur. Et persuasi quidem sumus unumquemque Deo Dilectissimo∣rum Sacerdotum ubi resciverint, cum Ecclesiasticarum; tum Publicarum rerum gra∣tia hac nostra Sanctione percitum, ad Sanctissimam Synodum diligenti studio prope∣ranter accursurum, & rebus ita necessariis atque ad beneplacitum Dei pertinenti∣bus pro viribus consulturum. Nos autem multam harum rerum curam ge∣rentes neminem desiderari leviter patiemur, nec ullam sive apud Deum, sive apud Nos excusationem habebit, si quisquam non con∣festim ad praedictum tempus loco determinato sedulus comparuerit: Quisquis enim ad Sacerdotalem vocatus Synodum non prompte accurrit, esse se Conscientia non bona Declarat. Deus te mul∣to tempore custodiat Pater Sanctissime ac Religiosissime. A most pregnant Testimony, that Emperors have, and ought to have a principal care of Religion, to preserve its purity, suppresse all Heresie contrary thereunto; to convene Synods when there is occasion, to enjoyn all Bishops to resort to them, and to examin, ratifie their Votes when approved by their Edicts; all which the Epistles written to these Emperors from the Bishops assembled in this Synod will more fully demonstrate. The famous General Council of Ephesus,Anno 432Surius Concil. Tom: 1. p. 655 to 694, & 660, 601, 602, &c. thus summoned by the most Religious Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian, to suppresse the Heresie of Nestorius, then in∣festing the Church, writ several Epistles to them, wherein they render them an account of all their proceedings therein, clear the scandalous reports raised of them, extoll those Emperors Zeal and Pietie for Defence of Religion, desire their Confir∣mation of their Votes, Suppression of Heresies, hereticks, and powr out prayers for, and Petitions to them. The Titles of their Epistles to them are: Pientis∣simis, Religiosissimis, ac Deo dilectissimis Theodosio & Valentiniano Victoribus, triumphatoribus ac semper Augustis, Sancta Synodus per gratiam Dei, et Dominationis vestrae nutum, Ephesi congregata. The 1. E∣pistle to them begins thus,Surius, ibid. p. 685. Jam inde à progenitoribus pietas vestra Christi amantes ac pientissimi Reges rectam est consecuta fidem, et hanc quotidie evehit multum{que} curarum veritatis impendit dogmatibus. Quorum gratia cum pertur∣batio non solum in magna illa Civitate, sed & in universo terrarum orbe per ea dogmata fieret quae a Nestorio sunt praedicata, de Sanctorum Patrum, sanctorumque Apostolorum
& Evangelistarum traditione, non contempsit vestra Dominatio perturbatas Ecclesias, et adulterata fidei ac verae pietatis dogmata; sed ex uni∣verso orbe pietas vestra Metropolitanos pientissimos, et aliorum quoque quarundam Civitatum Episcopos congregari jussit, suffi∣ciens ad eam rem temporis determinato spacio. After which they render them an Account of their proceedings in the Synod. Among other things they relate, Commentariis actorum, authoritatis gratia, pien∣tissimos pietatis vestrae literas praemiserunt; post quas fidei expositio∣nem subiecimus, proposita primum ea quae a sanctis est radita Apostolis; deinde et ea quae per sanctos trecentos decem et octo Patres Niceae quondam a be∣atae memoriae Constantino congregatos, est facta expositio: cujus fi∣dem dominatio vestra illustriorem reddidit. And concludes it thus; Oramus autem vestram Dominationem ut universam ipsius (Nesto∣ris) doctrinam et sanctis Ecclesis tolli, et libres ejus ubicunque in∣venti fuerint, igni tradi jubeat, quibus gratiam Dei, qui benevolentiae gratia homo factus est, reprobare conatur. Quod si quis sancita vestra contempserit, denuncietur illi, timendam ipsi esse dominatio∣nis vestrae indignationem: not their Anathema. They thus begin their Fourth Epistle:Surius Ibid. p. 688. Dominatio quidem vestra ad confirmandam pietatem sanctae Synodo diligentiorem dogmatum examinationem facere praecepit, quam et fecimus, veteri Patrum, imo et sanctorum Apostolorum et Evangelistarum, et trecentorum decem et octo qui Niceae congregati fuerunt, traditioni obtemperan∣tes, quam et concorditer interpretati sumus, et animo uno vestrae pie∣tati manifestam in Commentariis actorum exhibuimus, et in quibus et Nestorium diversa sentire depraehensum deposuimus. After which they inform the Emperors of Candidianus his favouring Nestorius,Ibid. p. 689. and indirect proceedings in the Council (of which the Emperors made him President) desi∣ring the Emperors to send for him, and what Bishops they pleased, qui res gestas coram vestra sancta pietate, tueantur. In the beginning of their 5. Epi∣stle, they write:Ibid. p. 689, 690. Quae sanctae sunt Synodo a dominatione vestra man∣data, ad competentem deducta sunt effectum, id quod pietati vestrae no∣tum fecimus: Relating the particulars at large, they conclude & pray, Quae a sancta aecumenica Synodo ad pietatis subsidium contra Nestori∣um, et impium illus scripta sunt dogma, suum habere robur, per pieta∣tis vestrae nutum et assensum confirmata. Their 6. Epistle to them thus begins.Ibid. p. 691. Deus ille omnium Christi amantes Imperatores, qui curam vestram ac diligentiam quam pietati impenditis gratam ac acceptam habet, etiam Episcoporum qui per occidentem sunt animos zelo, ad vindicandum Christum, contumelia affectum excitavit, &c. And thus concludes, Quoniam itaque causa haec finem consecuta est, cum Domina∣tioni vestrae optatum, tum Ecclesiis omnibus securissimum, & qui fidei suam adferat similitudinem, Pietatem vestram oramus, ut jam nos, alios pauperta∣te obrutos, alios morbis detentos, alios seniogravatos, et pere∣grinationem hanc amplius ferre non valentes, ita ut et aliqui ex no∣bis Episcopi et Clerici jam sint mortui, ab hac cura, et perigrina∣tione liberet, ut ista sedata sollicitudine, magnae Civitatis Ecclesiae curam geramus. Supplicamus etiam ut ad eos, qui singulis sint locis, literas comminatorias mittat, ne denuo alia suscitetur Ec∣clesiis molessia, ac perturbatio sanctissimis Episcopis in ipsorum re∣gionibus oriatur. Etenim facta jam pietatis declaratione & Ʋniverso Orbe consonum de illa sententiam ferente, paucis demptis, Nestorii amicitiam pieta∣te
praeferentibus gratiam hanc haud immeritam, petimus, dominatio∣ni vestrae supplicantes, ut nos cura ista deinceps liberet, ut ordinationi futuri Episcopi incumbamus, et in fide jam et Pietate confirmata nos Oblectemus, purasque ac synceras pro dominatione vestra Pre∣ces omnium Domino Christo destinemus. Their 8. Epistle to them is thus prefaced.Ibid. p. 63. Regia quidem vestra et Christi amans Majestas, Pientissimi Reges, a pueris Zelum circa fidem et Canones declaravit, cujus etiam gratia, Orbis E∣piscopos ad Ephesiorum Civitatem concurrere pia Sanctione praece∣pit, verum literae Serenitatis vestrae jam nobis per magnificentissi∣mum et Gloriosissimum Comitem Johannem sectae, haud modicam attulere perturbationem, innuentes imposturam quandam et men∣dacium pro veracibus quosdam vestris auribus objecisse, &c. And thus they conclude it; Sublimitati vestrae supplicamus, ut a sancta Synodo, quos dominatio vestra probaverit vocentur, ut coram regia vestra, et Christi amans Majestas de omnibus certius instruatur. Their 9. Epistle hath this Exordium, and Progress:Ibid. p. 663 Non est quidem Dominatio vestra passa rectam fidem quasi cuniculis quibusdam suf∣fodi per Nestorii doctrinam, &c. Ob hanc causam, Vniversi ad pie∣tatis vestrae dominationem confugimus supplicantes, ut quae con∣tra Nestorium et illi consentientes sunt gesta, robut suum habeant; quae vero ab illis, qui Nestorium vindicant, eo quod cum illo senti∣unt, contra Synodi nostrae Duces illegitime facta sunt, ineffica∣cia et irrita maneant, ut neque convenienter, neque canonice, sed contra eos qui de nullo sunt delicto convicti, sola ulciscendi libidine ab illis sunt gesta, qui contra sanctam Synodum cum Nestorio sen∣tiunt. All depending upon their Imperial Edicts, Orders, Ratifications. Ibid. 690. St. Cyril and Memnon begin their Book against Nestorius presented to this Council, in this manner. Divum Imperatorum decretum, et nos et vestram Sanctitatem in Ephesiorum Metropoli convenire jussit, ut et rectam Apostolicae fidei determinationem communi sententia confirmemus, et haeresim a Nestoro recens inductam probemus. These Emperors commanded all the Bishops summoned to appear in this Council, not to depart thence til all things were concluded: And because the Bishops there assembled were incensed against each other, each of them en∣deavouring to maintain his opinion, party by indirect means, the Emperors declared all things thus obtained to be nulled, & sent his Secretary of State, & some of his own Palace, together with the most famous Earl Candidianus, to this Council to preside therin, & see they acted nothing but what they by their Letters enjoyned them, & not to depart thence: as this clause in the Emperors Letters to the Council evidenceth.Surius Ibid. p 687, 694. Et obeam causam quisquam è nostro palatio, una cum preclarissimo Comite Candidiano missus fuerit, qui quaegesta sunt, secundum nostram jussionem cognoscat, et quae sunt inconvenientia prohibeat, ne{que} abscedat quisquam congregatorum Episcoporum ab Ephesiorum Civitate, neque ad Majestatis nostrae veniat exercitum, nec in Patriam su∣am revertatur, ita ut ista nemini, quacunque spe ducto, transgredi liceat. Sufficiant quidem istae literae ad denunciandum vestrae pietati, ne quid aliud praeter nostram jussionem iis quae facta sunt adjiciatis. Sci∣at tamen Sanctitas vestra, etiam illustrissimis provinciarum pri∣moribus esse scriptum, ut neminem prorsus sine nostra jussione in patriam ac civitatem suam reversum recipi sinant. Oportet e∣nim, ut omnia primum jurta id quod Deo placiturum est, sine con∣tentione
et cum veritate examinata, tum demum a nostra pietate corroborentur; neque enim Majestas nostra hominum jam aliquo∣rum, neque sanctissimi ac pientissimi Nestorii, neque cujusquam alterius, sed ipsius Doctrinae ac veritatisNota. curam gerit. Finally, these Emperours made their chief Secretary of State, and privy Coun∣sellor Register in this Synod; in their Epistles to the Bishops in this Council, expresse their great care of Religion; and towards the cloze thereof, sent the most glori∣ous John, Count of Sacred Things, to know what they had done concerning the Faith, that they might do what he should deem profitable for that end. Ibid. p. 691, 692. Celestino, Ruffo, Augustiniano, & reliquis religiosissimis Episcopis: Quantum zeli circa pietatem, et progenitorum nostrorum fidem ostenderimus, multis quidem (ut arbitramur) praecedentibusJudiciis. Judi∣ciis perspicue declaratum est: non minus autem illud et in eo, quod Synodum vestram nuper convocavimus, Ʋniverso Orbi manifesta∣tum esse credimus, &c. Sciat etiam Sanctitas vestra, quod prae∣clarissimum et Gloriosissimum Johannem Comitem Sacrorum ob eam causam misimus, ut ubi ille pietatis vestrae circa fidem scopum cognoverit, quae ipsi videbuntur utilia faciatis. By all which passages of this famous General Council, the Emperors Supream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, Judicature, care of the true Faith and Religion is most fully and clearly demonstrated beyond contradiction. Pope Coelestine himself was summoned to it, and excused his absence, but did not substituteSee Dr. James Bastardy of the Fathers, part 2 p. 90, 91. St. Cyril to supply his place therein, as some Romanists fable. The Oriental Bishops assembled in this Council favouring Arrius and Nestorius, by faction opposed Cyril and Memnon, making a Relation of their proceedings therein toSurius Ibidem p. 618, 619. Callimot King of Persia, (who commanded the Bi∣shops under him to appear at this Council) to incense him against them, thus praying his assistance against their actings. Pietas vestra, quae benefaciendo orbi et Ecclesiis Dei clarescit, jussit nos in Ephesio congregari, ita ut inde lucrum et pa Ecclesiae accresceret, non ut omnia confusione et deordinatione implerentur; et haec vestrae Majestatis edicta apertè et manifestè piam vestram et pacificam pro Ecclesiis Dei indicabant mentem. Atqui Cyrillus Alexandrinus, ad perniciem Ecclesiarum (ut videtur) & natus & educatus, assumpto cooperatore Memnonis Ephesiorum audacia; primum quidem placidum et pium vestrum edictum transgressus est, per omnia se illi non subditum declarans. Nam cum vestra Majestas praeceperit, de fide diligens examen et inquisitionem haberi, &c. assumpta sibi authoritate pro∣pria, neque a Canonibus, neque vestris edictis sibi concessa, con∣vertit ad omne deordinationis, et iniquitatis genus, &c. Proinde obsecramus et oramus, ut vestra Majestas quamprimum religioni quae impugnatur subsidium ferat, et celerem correctionem imponat illorum insaniae et tyrannidi, quae quasi turbo ad Haereticam perfi∣diam audaciores corripit. Iustum enim est, ut vestra pietas, Persi∣dis et earum quae inter Barbaros sunt, EcclesiarumNota. curam gerens, Ecclesias etiam quae sub Romanorum principatu turbantur, non despiciat.Surius Concil. Tom 1. p. 692. The Orthodox Bishops on the contrary, writ for the restitution, vindication of St. Cyril and Memnon to these Emperors; Supplicamus igitur Regiae vestrae Deo{que} dicatae Majestati, ut sanctissimos et Deo dilectissimos Episcopos Cyrillum & Memnonem Sanctae Synodo restituatis, nequaquam a Canonibus condemnatos, &c. et ut patrocinium orthodoxae fidei, quam hactenus et semper custodire sategistis. So that both
the Orthodox and Heretical Bishops in this Council acknowledged this Su∣pream Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction (by all these passages,) to be in the Empe∣rors and Kings, not them.

Pope Sixtus the 3d. was accused to the Emperor Valentinian,Anno 433 for defiling Chrysogonia, a consecrated Virgin, by one Bassus a Presbyter; who there∣upon commanded a Synod to be summoned to examine the accusation; where this Pope appearing, cum coram Synodo 56. Presbyterorum, causam dixis∣sset, cum magna examinatione (in the presence of Valentinian) judicio Synodico purgatus est, et condemnatus Bassus a Synodo; Bassus Va∣lentiniani jussu in exilium pulsus est. Lo here this Pope himself is 1. ac∣cused to the Emperor for Ecclesiastical offences by a Priest, as the Supream Ecclesia∣stical Judge. 2. The Emperor causeth a Synod to be summoned to hear and exa∣mine the cause; which he referrs unto them. 3ly. This Pope thereupon appears be∣fore this Synod, and in the Emperors presence pleads his cause, purgeth himself, and is acquitted by their Sentence. 4ly.

Liberius was summoned to come from Rome, and appear at Constantinople before the Emperor Constantius for defending Athanasius,Anno 355. condemned and excom∣municated by the Council of Tyre, and the whole world; who thereupon appearing accordingly, after a large discourse; Liberius refusing to renounce his communion and justifying Athanasius his cause, was by the Emperors sentence, banished to Berea in Thrace, after three dayes respite given him to advise, Whether he would subscribe a∣gainst his communion, and so return to Rome, or go into exile? In this conference he u∣sed these expressions to the Emperour; Judicia quidem Ecclesiastica, O Impe∣rator, summa cum aequitate fieri debent. Quapropter si tuae Clementiae ita visum sit, Iudicium haberiiubeto, &c. Then speaking for the Orthodox Bishops that were deprived; he added. Quapropter, si placet, iube Episcopos ad proprias sedes restitui: (though deprived by the Arrian Bishops in three Councils) hereby acknowledging the Supream Ecclesiastical Judicature, and power of depriving, re∣storing Bishops for matters of Faith, to be in the Emperor. Liberius after two years exile (upon the Petition of the Roman Matrons to this Emperor) was restored to his See of Rome, which Felix governed during his absence: but with this direction

Qua tamen per Sacerdotii Aposto∣lici principatum amplior facta est arce religionis, quam Solio Potestatis. AndEpigram 34. elsewhere, De Obsequiis Debitis Principi, he thus determines, Mitibus et Sanctis, nulla est Spernanda Potestas, A Equum servire est Regibus, ac Dominis: Ʋt Christi famulis ad veram prosit honorem, Dilexisse bonos, & tolerasse malos. Ecclesiast. Hist. l. 5 Pro∣mio. Socrates Scholasticus,Anno 440. his Contemporary, hath this passage; thus Englished by Bishop Hanmer his Translator. We have therefore throughout our History made mention of the Emperours, because that since they began to em∣brace the Christian Religion, the Ecclesiastical affairs seemed much to depend of them; so that the chiefest Councils were in times past, and are at this day summoned by their consent and procurement (not the Popes.) And he there further observes, how when the Commonwealth hath been tossed and turmoyled with troublesom dissention and discord, the Church of God likewise (as infected with the same contagious disease) hath been altogether out of quiet.Nota. For whosoever with diligent observation will remember the aforesaid times, without doubt he shall perceive (as our selves have lately done) that when the Commonwealth was in an hurliburly, the Church in like sort was shaken with the storms of adversity: for either he shall find, that both at one time, were out of quiet, or that the ones misery ensued immediately after the others misfortune: and sometimes when the Church began to vary about Religion, the Commonwealth immediately followed after with Rebellion; and some other times on the contrary. Therefore Godly Christian Emperors are the principal means under God to preserve the peace, and advance the felicity
of Church and State, by having the Supream Jurisdiction in and over both, and en∣deavouring the defence, propagation of the true orthodox faith, and spiri∣tual as well as temporal happinesse of their Subjects, as he proves through∣out his Ecclesiastical History; and Sozomenus too his coaetanean and fellow Hi∣storian in his History. Pope Leo the 1. flourishing about the year of Christ 450. with all the Churches,Anno 450. Clergy under him,Epist. 9. 13, 14 & 50,  earnestly besought the Emperor Theodosius the younger with Epistles and Tears, That he would command the General Council to be held within Italy; which he would not grant, but summoned the Council at Ephesus, and them to appear thereat. A clear confession of the Emperors, and disclaimer of his own Ecclesiastical Superiority: especially if compared with his 24. & 25. Epistles to the Em∣peror Theodofius, where he writes thus; Ecce ego, Christianissime Imperator, consa∣cerdotibus meis implens erga reverentiam Clementiae vestrae synceri amoris officium, cupiens{que} vos per omnia placere Deo, cui pro vobis ab Ecclesia supplicatur, &c. In his 59 Epist. to the Emperor Martian, he writes thus, Unde ineffabiliter Deo gratias ago, qui eo tempore quo oboritura Haereticorum scandala praesciebat Vos in Imperii fasti∣gio collocavit, in quibus ad totius mundi salutem, et regia potentia, et Sacerdotalis vigeret industria. Epist. 60. to the Empress Pulcheria he thus expresseth himself, Per quam significationem Clementiae vestrae, absolutè me gaude∣re, et incessabilibus, a Deo precibus postulare, ut vos et Romanae Rei∣publicae, et Catholicae Ecclesiae in omni prosperitate conservet. In his Epist. 74. to the Emperour Leo, he writes; Non desinimus gratias agere, et providentiam Dei, in fidei vestrae fervore benedi∣dicere, qui sancto et Catholico Spiritu, ita Haereticorum impudentiae restitistis. In his 78. Epistle to the same Emperor, he begins thus. Mul∣to gaudio mens mea exultat in Domino, et magna mihi est ratio glo∣riandi, cum Clementiae vestrae excellentissimam fidem augeri per omnia donis gratiae celestis agnosco, &c. Epist. 99. to the same Empe∣ror Leo he writes thus: Sciat igitur Clementia vestra omnes Ecclesias Dei cum laude vestra exultare pariter et laetari. Inveniemur impa∣res in gratiarum actione si nostri tantum oris angustiis Vniversalis Ecclesiae gaudia celebremus, &c.Epistola 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 23, 24, 29, 31, 33, 36, 37, 40, 41, 42, 43, to 54, 62, 67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 9. Yea this Pope himself in these and other his Epistles, exhorts all these Emperors, to defend the Christian saith against Here∣ticks defined in the Councils of Nice, Ephesus, and Chaelcedon, against all Hereticks that opposed their Creeds; by their Imperial Edicts to disannuall all Constitutions of here∣tical Councils, Bishops; and represse all Hereticks or Heresies contrary to them, and not suffer them to redebate the Articles of faith established in them. The same Pope Leo in his 7. Epistle highly commends Theodosius the Emperor, for his most pious care of the true Christian faith and religion, Ne scilicet in populo Dei, aut Schismata, aut Haereses, aut ulla scandala convaleseant. And Epistola 33. writing of the Priscillianists and their Heresies first breaking out in the world; he thus relates the zeal and Edicts of Princes then made against them. Quando mundi Principes ita hanc sacrilegam amentiam detestati sunt, ut Authorem ejus, ac plerosque discipulos legum publicarum ense prosternerant. Videbant enim omnem curam honestatis auferri, simulque divinorum jus humanumque subrui, si hujusmodi homi∣nibus vivere, cum tali professione licuisset. Et profuit diu ista districtio Ecclesiae lenitati; quae etsi Sacerdotali contenta judicio, et cruentas refugit ultiones, severis tamen Christianorum Princi∣pum constitutionibus adjuvatur, ut ad spirituale nomumquam recur∣rant remedium, qui timent corporale supplicium. What stronger, clearer evidence then these of this Pope Leo can we desire, to prove the Supremacy of Christian Emperors, Princes in divine and Ecclesiastical affairs, and over Popes themselves, and that they ought to take speciall care to preserve, propagate the true Christian faith, and suppresse all Heresies, Schisms, and scandalous crimes repugnant thereunto
Primasius Bishop of Utica in Africk,Anno 450 in his Commentary on 1 Tim. 2. Orate pro Regibus, &c. thus descants; ut cognoscant Deum, sive ut subjectas habeant Gentes; in illorum enim pace quies nostra consistit; si enim Christiani sunt, cessabit persecutionis impe∣tus. Hoc enim bonum est, & acceptum coram salvatore nostro, Vt et vos (especi∣ally if Christian Kings) sicut et ille, omnes homines salvari cupiatis▪ And Com: l. 2. in Apoc. c. 17. p. 101, 102. He thus describes the Soveraign power of the Ro∣man Emperors typified by St. John: Proprie autem septem capita, septem montes, ut Romam, quae super septem montes praesidet significans, omni quod orbe Monarchiae praefuit Dominatu, ad istorum Regum similitudinem adduxisset, & in Roma invi∣niri totius Regnipotentiam figuraret. Septenario autem numero voluit univer∣salitatem ipsius Dominationis ost endere; as well over Popes, as others within their Territories. The General Council of Chalcedon Anno 451.Anno 450 consisting of no lesse then 630. Bishops and Fathers of the Church,Surius Concil. Tom. 2. p. 8, 10, 11, 21, 16, 31, 102, 103, 106, 129, 142, 157, 158, 162. was summoned by the Emperors Martian & Va∣lentinian, fidelium facta est Synodus ex decreto piissimorum Imp. Martiani et Valentiniani. Martianus in his Epistle to Pope Leo concerning its summons, writes thus; De studio & oratione nostra, Sanctitas tua non dubitat, quoniam Chri∣stianorum religionem et Catholicam fidem firmiter volumus perma∣nere, et ab omni populo pia mente servari. Denique sollicitudinem nostrae potentiae, ex recta religione et propiciatione Salvatoris nostri consistere, non ambigunt. These Emperors Valentinianus and Martianus in their Letters to this Council (first convened by them at Nice) to remove to Chal∣cedon, since by reason of their other affairs they could not repair to Nice, and their presence was necessary in this Council, use this memorable expression; Illud enim praecavemus, licet Nos hic publicae causae retineant, quoniam quae prosint verae et orthodoxae fidei, et paci et disciplinae sanctarum Ec∣clesiarum, OMNIBUS ARBITRAMUR ESSE PRAEPONENDA, nec dubitamus quia etiam vestrae sanctitati hoc placebit. Nos enim propter ferventissimum Dei zelum, publicarum rerum necessarias utilitates in praesenti distulimus, multum desiderantes ea; quae et orthodorae et verae sunt fidei, tranquillitatis nostrae praesentia confir∣mari. Orare ergo dignemini pro nostro Imperio, quatenus et ho∣stes Nobis subditis efficiantur, et pax in Vniverso orbe firmetur, et Romanae res secure consistant; quod etiam nunc vos facere iudicamus. In their Epistle to Dioscorus Patriarch of Antioch they write, Cunctis constitit manifestum, quia nostrae reipublicae status, & omnia humana, divina pietate mode∣rantur atque firmantur. Deo enim propicio constituto prospere & secundum vota nostra gubernari res & proficere solent. imperium ergò divino nutu sortiti, sub∣ditis pro pietate et mansuetudine si militer necessaria plurimam sol∣licitudinem impartimus, quatenus et vera religio, et nostra respub∣lica, cultu Dei purissimo, et pietate firma praefulgeat. When the Council met at Chalcedon by their Summons, the Emperor Martianus, accompanied with his Empress, and Senators, made a most pious Ora∣tion to them; with this memorable Exordium. Cum primum per electionem in regnum de secreto Dei provecti sumus, inter tan∣tas publicas utilitates, nullum magis Nos constrinxit negoti∣um quam rectam et veram fidem Christianorum, quae sancta et vene∣randa consistit, indubitatam omnibus declarare. Then taxing those Bishops and Clergymen who out of avarice and vainglory had broached Here∣sies, to the prejudice of the Orthodox faith, and Churches peace, which he had summoned them to settle by his authority. He subjoyns, Nobis autem omne studium adhibendum est, ut populus propter veram sanctamque doctri∣nam ipsum sentient uni rectae applicare Ecclesiae. And therefore he ex∣horts them to addresse themselves with all expedition and sincerity, truly to expound the Catholick faith, and disperse the clowd of Error in this Synod;
ut semper servantur quae statuta sunt. Erit quidem divinae providentiae, quod pie fieri volumus, in seculo hoc confirmare firmissima. Et post Regis haec verba, omnes Episcopi clamaverunt: Martiano novo Constantino multi anni: Orthodoxis multi anni; Martiano amatori Christi, Regnum vestrum in perpetuum permaneat, digni Orthodoxae fidei amatoris. In this Council, the Emperor, & Gloriosissimi Judices, & amplissimus Senatus, areSurius Tom. 2. p. 164, 165, 186, 188. first named in every Session, sate in the midst and chiefest place, and were the Presidents, Moderators, chief Judges in this Council, as the frequent repetitions of, Gloriossimi Judices & amplissimi Senatus, dixerunt, through all the Acts and Sessions of this Coun∣cil, resolve; and these oft repeated acclamations of the Bishops approving their de∣cisions and resolves:Surius Tom. 2. p. 137, 138, Multi anni Imperatoribus, Deus qui hoc fecit. Multi anni Imperatorum, Magnorum Imperatorum multi anni, multi anni Senatus, multi anni Iudicum, Orthodoxorum multi anni, Haec integra ab initio; haec pax Ecclesiarum. Piissimis et Christi Amantibus nostris, nostris Imperatoribus Flavio Valenti∣niano, et Flavio Martiano, Victoribus et Triumphatoribus sem∣per Augustis, multi anni. Hence they with divers other Archimandritae, or Abbots in their Epistle to the Emperour Martianus pray thus for him. Ut iterum per sanctos Patres sancta fide confirmata, possimus reliquum tempus vitae nostrae castè & piè vivere, & in pace incessanter consuetas orationes offerre Domino nostro Christo pro diu∣turnitate aterni vestri Imperii, qui et sua bona voluntate invisibiliter, nobis do∣navit Imperium Divinissimi Augusti. After this, Actio 6. Martianus the Emperor making two Orations to the Council, the one in Latin, the other in Greek, (Recorded in the Acts thereof.) All the whole Council at the end of both his Orati∣tions cryed out,Surius, p. 142, 145, 161, 197, 198. Multi anni Imperatori, multi anni Augustae, Orthodoxis multos an∣nos, Imperatori multos Annos, Augustae Orthodoxae multos annos, Maritiano Ama∣tori Christi, vestrum nobis duret Imperium, semper nobis Impera∣tis, digne ex Orthodoxa fide, Amatoribus Christi procul invidia. After which these Bishops having tendered a Confession of their Faith to the Emperour, Omnes clamaverunt, Omnes sic credimus, &c. Martiano novo Constantino, novo Paulo, novo David, multos Annos, Da∣vid Imperatori pro Domino, vitam ei, Novo Constantino, Novo Martiano. Vos fides nostra; Christus quem honoras, ipse te eu∣stodiet, Orthodoxam fidem tu roborasti. Sicut Apostolici ita cre∣ditis, Augustae multos annos.

Omnes Haereticos tu fugasti, Nestorium et Eutichen tu persecutaes. Absit invidia a vestro Imperio, fideles Imperatores sic honorantur. Deus cu∣stodiat potestatem vestram, Deus pacificet imperium vestrum. Martianus novus Constantinus, Pulcheria nova Helena. zelum Helenae tu sectaris, vestra vita munimen cunctorum est, vestra fides Ecclesiarum Gloria est. Afterwards the Emperor rendring publique thanks to God for Composing the manifold discords of those who had erred concerning the Faith, and that now in unam eandemque Religionem omnes nunc una voluntate convenerimus, sperantes celerrimam ve∣stris ad divinitatem Precibus et cura omnem pacem Nobis a Deo donari; Omnes Clamaverunt, Haec digna vestro Imperio, Haec propria vestri regni, &c.

Omnes clamaverunt, Multos annos Imperatori, Multos annos Augustis, Piae et Chri∣stianae Augustae Orthodoxae multi anni. Multos annos piae et Matri∣cae Christi, Imperium vestrum Deus custodiat. In perpetuum ma∣neat vestrum Imperium. In thisSurius, Tom. 2. p. 25. 38. 55. 58. 66, 67. 95 109. Council Actio 1. when some would have added an explanation to the Canon of the Council of Nice, the Egyptian, Oriental and other Bishops cried out, Nemo suscepit adjectionem, nemo diminu ionem. Quae in Nicea constituta sunt, teneant; Catholicus Imperator hoc jussit. Quod Imperialis praecipit autoritas, omnibus modis observandum est; Iustum est quae a piissimo Principe praecepta erant effectui mancipa∣ri. Et necesse nobis erit in omnibus Imperatoris Christi amore cedere jussioni. Omnia referantur ad cognitionem Clementiae Im∣perialis, postulamus ejus referri Clementiae, &c. Iussum est a Do∣mino orbis terrae, ut Synodus de Flaviano prius judicaret. Actio 11. Bassianus Bishop of Ephesus humbly petitioned the Emperours Valen∣tinian and Martian, to be restored to his Bishoprick, and goods, of which he was forcibly dispossessed by Souldiers, without hearing ut iis petitis consuetas Ora∣tiones referam, incessanter Deo pro vestrae Potestatis Imperio. In this Council, there are frequent recitals of Sancta & magna & Vniversalis Synodus quae gratia Dei secundum Sanctionem piissimorum,Surius, Tom. . p. 11, 20, 21, 27, 132, 133, 102, 103, 106, 120. et Deo aman∣tis suorum Imperatorum immaculata collecta est in Chalcedonen∣si Civitate. Imperator Episcopos vocavit. Placuit et nunc piissi∣mis et Christianissimis Imperatoribus nostris sancire, sanctam et magnam vestram Synodum huc concurrere quatenus quae nuper emerserunt de catholica & immaculata nostra fide quaerantur; et ea radicitus evellan∣tur; & ne fortè trahentia & retrahentia, simplicissimos aliquos in foveam perfidis et erroris impingent, quia tanta eis est de pietate solicitudo, et ut ea cu∣stodiantur in perpetuum, inconcussa et immaculata quae de Ortho∣doxa Religione nostra pridem quidem a beatissimis patribus quae in Nicea convenerunt sunt exposita. Their Letters of Summons sent to Di∣oscorus Bishop of Alexandria, and other Bishops, begin thus. Imperatores Caesares, &c. Omnibus constat manifestum, quia nostrae reipublicae dis∣positio et universa humana per pietatem circa Deum continentur et confirmantur. When this General Council, by the Emperors Judges and Sena∣tors approbation, had finished their determinations concerning the Christian faith; the Emperors ratified them by their Imperial Lawes, Edicts, prohibiting all Con∣venticles, Disputations, Heresies, and Bookes against them, as their Lawes recor∣ded inSurius, Tom. 2. p. 133, 134 &c. Surius,Codicis, lib. 1. Tit. 4. Lex 3, 4. Justinian, and others (over tedious to relate) demonstrate: wherein they declare, Tandem aliquando quod summis votis atque studiis opta∣bamus, evenit. Remota est de Orthodoxa Christianorum lege contentio; tandem remedia culpabilis erroris inventa sunt, et discors populorum sen∣tentia in unum consensum concordiamque convenit. Cessat igitur jam prophana contentio. Nam in contemptores hujus Legis poena non deerit, quia non solum contra fidem bene compositam veniunt, sed etiam Iudaeis et Paganis ex hujusmodi certamine prophanant veneranda mysteria. Sacro nostrae Serenitatis Edicto veneran∣dam Synodum confirmantes, admonuimus Vniversos, ut de reli∣gione disputare desinant, &c. In this General Council of Chalcedon, I shall observe these three Passages relating to the Glorious Lay-Judges, and Senate pre∣siding therein by the Emperors appointment. 1. That when theSurius Concil. Tom. 2. p. 17. Bishops in the Synods first Session, were divided against each other, in the Cases of Theodoretus and Dioscorus, some crying out against the one, that he should be thrust out of the Synod; others, that he should sit, and the other side excluded: Impugnatorem Dei foras mittite, Judaeum foras mittite; Seditiosos foras mittite, &c. Multos annos Au∣gustae,
Catholico Imperatori multos annos. Thereupon Gloriosissimi Iudices et amplissimus Senatus dixerunt, Acclamationes istae populares neque Episcopos decent, neque partes juvant. 2. That in the debates concerning the Orthodox faith,Ibid. p. 101, 103; 106. Glo∣riosissimi Judices et amplissimus Senatus dixerunt, in judicio fidei non est isa defensio. De Recta quidem & Catholica side, perfectius sequenti die convenienti Concilio, diligentierem Examinationem fieri oportere perspicimus. Nunc autem hoc quaerendum & studendum & judicandum est, ut vera fides contineatur, pro qua maximè & Concilium facturi est, &c. directing the Bishops how to proceed therein, and informing them of the Emperors resolution and their own concerning it, in these words; Scire enim vos velumus quia tam divinissimus & piissimus Orbis terrarum Dominus, quam Nos, Catholicam fidem à 318. & à 150. necnon etiam a caeteris sanctissimis & gloriosissimis patribus traditam, custodimus, & secundum ipsam credimus; Whereupon, Reverendissimi Epis∣copi clamant; Expositionem alteram nullus facit, neque tentamus, neque au∣demus exponere. Docuerunt eam Patres, & in scriptis custodiantur quae ab eis sunt exposita, & citra ea dicere non possumus. Sufficiunt quae exposita sunt, alteram expo∣sitionem non licet fieri. Gloriosissimi Judices & amplissimus Senatus dixerunt, Re∣citentur quae exposita sunt a Sanctis 318 Patribus in Nicea congregatis. Whereupon the Nicene Creed was read, with the Epistle of Leo, and other Treatises in defence thereof: then voted by the Judges, Senate, Council, and ratified by the Emperors Edicts. 3ly. That when the complaints of the Orthodox Bishops unjustly deprived in a former Council at Ephesus by Dioscorus and others, were there fully heard, the former proceedings against them read, and Witnesses examined by the Judges with those who deposed them; the Judges and Senate, not the Council, gave this final sentence therein; Gloriosissimi Iudices, et amplissimus Senatus, dixerunt: Quoniam verò Flavianus religiosae memoriae,Ibidem, p. 102. 103. 106. Cent. Magd. 5. col. 934, 935. & Eusebius reverendus Episcopus ex gesto∣rum & cogniionum scrutatione, & ipsa voce quorundam qui huic Synodo praefuerint, confitentium se errasse, & frustra eos damnasse: quia nihil circa fidem monstrantur crasse, ostenduntur injuste depositi, Videtur nobis (secundum quod Deo placitum est) Iustum esse (si placuerit divinissimis et pussimis Dominis nostris) eidem paellae Dioscorum reverend. Episcopum Alexandriae, & Juvenalem reverendum Epis∣copum Hierosolymorum, & Thalassium reverend. Episcopum Caesariae Cappadociae, & Eusebium reverend. Episcopum Ancyrae, & Eustathium reverend. Episcopum Beryti, & Basileum reverend. Episcopum Seleucite Isauriae, qui potestatem et principatum Synodi tenuerunt, subjecere, et a sancto Concilio secundum regu∣las, ab Episcopali dignitate fieri alienos, omnibus quae acta sunt, ad sacrum Apicem (the Emperors) referendis. Hereupon Orientales, & qui cum ipsis reverendi Episcopi, clamaverunt, Hoc justum Iudicium: Mul∣tos annos Senatui, multos annos Imperatoribus. Impius semper fugit, Dioscorum Christus deposuit; Homicidam Christus deposuit: Haec justa sententia; Hoc justum concilium: Iustus Senatus, Iustum Con∣cilium; which they oft repeated. On the other side, Illyriani Episcopi di∣xerunt; Omnes erravimus, omnes veniam mereamur. Has preces Concilio Catholico, has preces Augusto; Omnes peccavimus, omnibus indulgeatur precamur; omnes peccavimus, omnium mi∣seremini. Omnes peccavimus, omnibus indulgete. Dioscorum in Synodo,Nicephorus. Eccles. Hist. l. 45. c. 4. 8 Cent. Magd. 5. col. 55. Dioscorum in Ecclesiis. These Interlocutions ended, Magni∣ficentissimi, et gloriosissimi, et amplissimus Senatus et Iudices di∣xerunt, Quae interlocuta sunt, effectui mancipantur. After this judge∣ment Dioscorus, was deprived and banished accordingly by the Emperor, and Prote∣rus substituted in his place. 4ly. It is observable whatSurius, Ibid. p. 55. Melipthongus spake in this Council & debate, Quoniam igitur piissimus Imperator ex avita traditione consue∣vit orthodoxam continere fidem. Et in nullas sanctas regulas ir∣rumpere, postulamus ejus referri Clementiae. Et si jusserit in criminali causa alterum pro altero decertare, et hoc suscipimus, praecipue quia universalem praecepit fieri Synodum. All which ir∣refragable Passages infallibly demonstrate these Emperors Supremacy in all religious and Ecclesiastical affairs in that age; and that they reputed the maintenance, propa∣gation
of the true Orthodox faith, and their peoples spiritual Welfare; the principal part of their Regal care, and Imperial office. These Religious zealous Emperors, as they ratified the Decrees for the Orthodox Faith made in this General Council of Chalcedon,Anno 451 so they did by this their Edict confirm those of the Council of Nice, summoned and formerly ratified by Constatine the Great,Justin. Cod: lib. 1. Tit. 4. Lex. 2, 3.

I find this Supplicatory Letter and Petition of Bassianus to the Emperors Valentinianus and Martianus, beginning thus; Surius, Tom. 2. p. 180, 181, to 18 Terrae, marisque et totius humani generis Dominis (therefore of all Popes certainly) Flaviis Valentimano et Martiano perpetuis Augustis, Supplicatio & depre∣catio, a Bassiano humili & pusillo Episcopo. Omnis salus violentiam patien∣tium post Deum vestra tranquillitas est, praecipue autem Sacerdo∣tum Christi. Quapropter et ego ad has preces veni, provolutus vestigiis vestris, ut mei misereamini. Then relating his case and grievance in being forcibly thrust out of the Bishoprick of Ephesus to which he was elected, of which he had 4. years possession, by Stephanus then Bishop; He adds, Supplico vestrae pietati, et volvor divinis vestris sacratis vestigiis, quatenus sancire dignetur vestra caelestis potestas, sacra vestra subnotatione missa ad sanctum Concilium, ut cognitio fiat inter me miserrimum et eos qui in me talia praesumpserint, &c. Whereupon the Emperors referred his cause to the examination of the Council; where both parties are heard; Et glo∣riosissimi Iudices, appointed by the Emperors to preside in this Council, not the Bishops, directed the proceedings, examine the cause, and pronounce the Sentence, that both of them should be removed, as unduly elected and ordained, but retain the name of Bishops, that Bassianus should have an annual pension out of it during his life, and restitution to all goods taken from him, upon due proof thereof. In theSurius. Tom. 2 p. 186 same General Council, Actio 13. Eunomius Bishop of Nicomedia, and all his Clergy, exhibited the like Petition to these Emperors, beginning as the former, Terrae, marisque, et totius gentis hominum Dominis, &c. Deus vobis Imperium, ut omnes gubernetis (therefore Popes, as well as others) ad salutem orbis terrarum, et pacem sanctarum Ecclesia∣rum juste donavit: Quapropter ante omnia, et per omnia (mark it) piissimi et Christi amantissimi Principes pro orthodoxae et sa∣luberrimae fidei dogmatibus cogitatis, tam haereticorum fremitus extinguentes, quam pia ad lucem dogmata deducentes. Vnde proster∣nimus nos Majestatis vestrae vestigiis, ut jubeatis arceri injustitiam quae adversum nos a reverendissimo Episcopo Niceno Anastatio est praesumpta, quatenus valeamus congrua pace fruentes sine intermis∣sione divina mysteria perficere, et consuetas orationes Domino Deo pro aeterna vestra potestate solvamus. Their complaint was, that A∣nastatius, neque honorem Dei prae oculis sumens, neque leges vestrae pietatis reveritus, had invaded their rights, quas nobis pietatis vestris legi∣bus & Ecclesiasticis sanctionibus sunt collata, quae nullus aliquando praecessorum ejus jubere aut movere tentavit. Both parties are heard, and their case examined as the former, by the Gloriosissimi Judices; not Bishops. Surius, ibid. 188, 189. In the 14th Action of this Council, I meet with this memorable Petition of Salvinianus, Paros Episcopi, somewhat varying from the former, Piissimis et Christo amantissimis, et digne a Deo omnium honoratis Augu∣stis Valentiniano & Martiano, preces & supplicatio, à Salviniano Episcopo. Dominus omnium videns Apostolicam et Orthodoxam fidem a dissi∣mulatoribus interim fatigari, et omnem mundum seditionibus vexa∣ri,
et suscitavit vestram pietatem universum mundum regere at∣que gubernare, et tumultus qui a nefandis exorti sunt, sanctorum doctrina reprimere, et claritatem atque soliditatem recti dogma∣te confirmare. Vnde juste vestrae tranquilitati ac de vobis dicit Deus,Psal. 8. Exaltavi electum de plebe mea, Inveni David servum meum, &c. Credens itaque nutu divino super omnem principatum ac dominatio∣nem consistere vestrum Principatum (therefore above the Popes, and Councils) adsum supplicans et rogans vestram pietatem, ut mei pro∣videntiam fieri, et causam meam examinari praecipiatis; Ego enim a puero eram in Monasterio dispensator omnium rerum, nihil de Episcopatu cogitans, neque rogans quemquam hujus gratia dignitatis. Dum ergo essem in Mo∣nachorum providentia constitutus, adstitit mihi repentè illius temporis Metropolitanus E∣piscopus cum provincialibus Episcopis, & me Paros ordinavit Episcopum, de qua in scriptis dejectus est Athanasius, ex gravissim is capitibus accusatus, nec volens pro illatis sibi cri∣minibus reddere rationem, qui aliquando quidem Episcopatum repudiabat. Frequenter vero citationes vocantium cum ad Synodorum judicium, declinabat. Is enim in Ephesina Synodo ex praecepto Alexandrini praesulis in meam Ecclesiam superingressus est, & ego, praeter voluntatem meam ordinatus, expulsus sum. Et haec quidem ecta sunt habita∣toribus illius civitatis dolentibus & lugentibus meam expulsionem. Supplico igitur et vestrae potentiae, ut jubeatis meam causam sub praesentia vestrae pietatis examinari, et placitum terminum dari; ut et ego cum cun∣ctis aliis consuetas orationes pro perpetua vestra potentia semper exolvam, Piissimi atque victores Principes. Salvianus Episcopus di∣ctata et subscripsi et offero vestrae pietati. Baeronicianus vir devotissimus, Secretarius divini Consistorii legit. This Cause, and all the proceedings in it in two former Councils of Ephesus and Antioch, were fully heard, read and consi∣dered, and at last referred by the Judges themselves to Maximus Bishop of Antioch to settle, Salvianus in the mean time being to enjoy the Title of the Bishop of Paros, and receive maintenance out of it. I find inEcclesiast. Hist. l. 2. c. 8. Evagrius (but not in the Acts of this Council) a like Petition from Eusebius Bishop of Dorileum; beginning thus, It behoveth your Majesties (most noble and puissant Emperors) to provide carefully for the quieting of all your loving Subjects, and to defend from injuries all other men, but especially the sacred Senate of Priesthood. And herein the divine Godhead, which hath granted unto you the rule and domination of the whole world, is truly ho∣nored; wherefore seeing the Christian faith, and we our selves also have been oppressed, and unjustly molested by extreme wrong by Dioscorus, the most Reverend Bishop of the most Noble City of Alexandria, we are now come unto your wonted Clemency, to crave Iustice at your hands. Then complaining of his and Flavianus Bishops of Constantinoples unjust depositions from their Bishopricks in the Council of Ephesus, by the power and unjust practises of Dioscorus; and accusing him of Blasphemy and Heresie; he Petitions the Emperors on his bended knees, that his Petition might by his Letters be referred to the Council; that both their doings might therein by justly examined, and indifferently heard before them, and then certified to their Imperi∣al Majesties, to do them right. By all which Petitions, even of these Bishops themselves, the Soveraign Autho∣rity of Christian Emperors and Kings in and over all Ecclesiastical causes; persons, and in matters of faith, religion, and final Right of Appeals to them from unjust Judgements given not only by Bishops, but General Councils in the very case of de∣privation of Bishops for Heresie and Ecclesiastical offences,Anno 458 is so clearly set forth by words and actions, that nothing can be more full and satisfactory.Evagrius Ec∣cles. Hist. l. 2. c. 8, 9: Nice∣phorus Eccles. l. 15. c. 18, &c▪ Surius Council. Tom. 2. p. 224, 225, &c. The Emperor Leo by his Letters to all Metropolitans in the very beginning of his reign, confirmed the Orthodox faith professed heretofore by his Predecessors; yet notwithstanding, the Heretical faction at Alexandria, in the absence of Diony∣sius Captain of the Garrison, elected Timotheus Aelius (an heretick, and oppugner of the Council of Chalcedon) for their Bishop, and barbarously slew Proterius their orthodox Bishop, thrusting Timotheus into his place; whereupon all the Bishops of
Aegypt and Clergy of Alexandria by a supplicatory Epistle complained to this Em∣peror Leo the 1. of this outrage, desiring Justice and redresse: wherein they relate, A superna gratia modo divinitus condonatus, justè non cessas pro communi utilitate cogi∣tare, post Deum cunctorum venerabilis Imperator. Quapropter omnis fortitudo verborum tuis vincitur actibus. Nuper enim electus a Deo et purpura exornatus optimum judicasti propositum tuum magnum ostendere, quem ipse omnium Creator elegit, benignius initiis largitatem remunerando bonorum, quando repentè in ipso principio voce vestra ex scripto procedente piissimo, ad Sanctissimos Metropolitanos, E∣piscopos, inerumpibilem Ecclesiae Catholicae crepidinem roborasti, et priorum omnium, piiss imorumque Principum constituta, pro Or∣thodora religione firmasti.

Injuria namque Dei manifesta est, hae∣reticorum alscindentium semetipsos à recta ide, licentia. Quapropter hoc optime sciens venrabilis Imperator, maligni prolem existere insidiantes quieti sanctarum Christi semper Ecclesiarum, earum{que} immutilatam pacem consistere non scientes, recte provirum tuam studuisti mox adhiberi, ei per omnia resistentem, QUOD EST OPUS PIISSIMORUM PRINCIPUM (let Popes and Prelates observe it) pro orthodoa wfide pugnantium, et resistentium malis extrinsecus venientibus, ET ANIMABUS FIDELI∣UMADVERSANTIBUS. Hunc igitur animum te possidente religiosum et tu∣torem humani generis tantum{que} circa Christum studium demonstran∣tem, adimus ex nos, importabilia mala passi, licet peccatores Christi Ponti∣fices: Then relating their grievances, the election of Timotheus, the murder of Proterius, the growth of heresie, opposing the orthodox faith, and violent thrusting them out of their Churches, at large, to the Emperor, thus pray redresse from him as their only Supream Ecclesiastical Judge and Protector. Sanciri praecipite ut expulsi sine calumnia ad suas Ecclesias, in pace celebrantes, pro vestra pietate solennes orationes, cum quiete servari, urbem∣que pariter et in ea sanctas Ecclesias constitutas ad Christi gloriam et salutem, et perpetuitatem vestrae Christianissimae pietatis; Literas dirigentes, pro his quae poscimus ad magnificentissimum Dionysium Ducem, necnon ad singularum provinciarum Iudices (not to the Pope, or any Clergy-men) quatenus ea quae a vestra mansuetudine sunt san∣cita, et servantur, et effectui contradantur. Hereupon this pious Em∣peror presently sent abroad his Letters to all the Cities,Suus Concil. Tom. 2. p. 224. Nicephorus, l. 15. c. 18, &c. Bishops and Chur∣ches under his Empire; wherein he declares, Votum quidem mei pieta∣tis fuit universas orthodoxorum sanctas Ecclesias, necnon et Civi∣tates sub Romano Imperio constitutas, maxima frui quiete, nihil∣que contingere, quod possit earum statum tranquillitatemque tur∣bare, &c. Then relating the tumults at Alexandria in electing Timotheus their Bi∣shop; he requires them all to summon all their Bishops and Clergy together, and examining all these things with deliberate care and fidelity, to certifie him their several opinions concerning his election, and the Council of Chalcedons determinations. This they accordingly did, by their respective Letters returned to the Emperor collected byTom. 2 p. 224. to 277. Surius; being 38. in number (one from Pope Leo the 1.) subscribed with above 500 Bishops hands, wherein they approve the Council of Chalcedon, desiring the Emperor to ratifie it by his new Imperial Edicts, condemn Timotheus and electi∣on, and most lively, fully set forth and acknowledge the Emperors Supremacy in and over all Religious, Ecclesiastical persons and affairs, in preserving the Orthodox faith, peace and unity of the Church, suppressing Hereticks, Schismes, redressing all undue elections, abuses of Bishops and others, as the principal part of his Regal Office, Trust, Care; and inform him: Pietatis vestrae et Christianita∣tis

All their Epistles are fraught with these and the like passages, expressions, prayers, then which nothing can be more demonstrative, to evidence his Ecclesiastical Supremacy, and all Princes So∣veraign care of Religion and Church affairs, against all Papal or Pontifi∣cal cavils in succeeding degenerous times. After reception and perusal of these Epistles to this Emperor from all quarters of the Empire, he by his Imperial decrees ratified the Councils of Nice, Ephesus, Chalcedon; expelled, banished Timotheus, and suppressed Hereticks in all places, to the joy of all good Christians, and advancement of Christianity.
The Emperor Zeno (who succeeded Leo) to compromise the differences then in the Church about the Orthodox faith and Councils of Nice and Chalcedon,Anno 484. publish∣ed a pacifical Edict,Niceph Eccles. Hist. l. 16. c. 12. which he intituled Henoticum, with this Prologue Cum Impe∣rii nostri initium et conservationem, tum autem opes et armaturam inexpugnabilem persua∣sum habeamus esse, Solam rectam et veram fidem quam divina inspira∣tione Nicaeae 318. sancti Patres congregati promulgarunt, et Con∣stantinopoli 150. itidem sancti Patres coacti confirmaverunt, die no∣ctuque precationibus, studiis, LEGIBUSQUE NOSTRIS OMNIBUS hoc agimus, ut per eam ubique locorum sancta Dei Catholica et A∣postolica Ecclesia incrementa capiat, qnae incorruptibilis et immor∣talis sceptrorum nostrorum mater, et pii populi nostri, in pace et religionis divinae concordia persistentes, acceptabiles pro Imperio nostro preces, una cum Dei amantissimis Episcopis, et piissimis Clericis et Archimandratis et Monachis fundant, &c. Itaque quum fides irreprehensibilis et Nos, et Imperium sic conservet; Scire vos volumus, neque nos, neque ubique socorum quae sunt Ec∣clesias aliud symbolum, aut doctrinam aut formulam fidei, aut fi∣dem etiam praeterquam quod (sicut dictum est) a 318 editum, et 150 Patribus comprobatum est, sanctum sumbolum vel habuisse, vel ha∣bere, vel habituros esse. Nam id solum Symbolum, Imperium no∣strum conservare confidimus. Quemlibet vero qui aliud quicquam sensit, aut sentit, aut nunc, aut quandocunque, vel Chalcedone, vel quacunque alia Synodo, ANATHEMATI SUBJICIMUS; praecipue vero Nestorium et Eutychen, et qui cum eis idem sentiunt. Consurgite ergo vos per unionem spirituali matri Ecclesiae per id unum et solum 318 sanctorum Patrum professionis fidei decretum. Quod si feceritis, Domini et Servatoris et Dei nostri Iesu Christi benignitatem vobis ipsis conciliabitis, tum ab Im∣periali nostra amplitudine laudem eximiam feretis. This Imperi∣al Edict being publikely read in Alexandria in the Church before all the peo∣ple by Peter Mogge their Bishop, Alexandrini universi sanctae et Catholi∣cae Ecclesiae conjuncti unitique sunt, et quaecunque in medio fuere offendicula et impedimenta sustulere, writesNiceph. Eccl. Hist. l. 16. c. 12. Nicephorus. This Em∣peror Zeno resolved to thrust out Timotheus Aelius Bishop of Alexandria, complained of to, and removed, banished by the Emperor Leo, (as you heard before) yet resto∣red by the Usurping Emperor Basiliscus to his See after 18. years exile; but under∣standing he was very aged and like to die, he altered his resolution; He dying soon after, the Alexandrians without this Emperors license or privity, elected one Peter Mogge, (a man then unsound in the faith) for their Bishop, who was consecrated by two heretical Bishops. The Emperor being informed thereof, removed Peter by his Letters after 36. dayes possession, and by other Letters restored Timotheus Salophaciolus (the rightfull Bishop dispossessed by the other Timothy, banished by Basiliscus) to this See, putting those to death who elected Peter. After which the Clergy of Alexandria sending an Embassy to the Emperor, by one John and o∣thers; He granted them Liberty after the death of Timothy to elect whom they would for their Bishop, except this John, who took an Oath before the Emperor, haud unquam se Alexandriae thronum accepturum esse, and so departed. Yet after Timothies death, John forgetting and neglecting his Oath, by money procured himself to be advanced to this See by the Alexandrians: Of which the Emperor being informed, he commandedNiceph. Ca∣listus, Eccles: Hist. l. 16. c. 1, 16, 17. Plati∣na, Onuprius & Lydius  Felice 3 John to be ejected, and restored Peter Mogge to the See by his Letters, who promised to read, publish and observe the Emperors forecited Decree Henoticum; which he accordingly performed. John being thus ejected, resorts to Rome to Pope Felix the 3d. complaining, he was ejected only for defending the Do∣ctrine of the Emperor Leo, and Council of Chalcedon: who writ a Letter to Zeno re∣prehending him for Johns illegal ejection and desiring his restitution: who answered,
He ejected him not for the cause suggested, but for his perjury. After this he exhibited a Li∣bel of complaints to Pope Felix the 3. (about the year 483) complaining against Peter as an Heretick, and against Acacius Bishop of Constantinople for holding communi∣on with him, and being the chief instrument of his restitution: and in a Synod at Rome procured Peter (formerly condemned, banished, and excommunicated by a Synod) to be declared an Heretick, and deprived, especially quod quum ab haereticis consecratus est, orthodoxis praeesse non potest: and in their Sentence they blamed Aca∣cius as guilty of a great crime, quod ad Simplicium scribens, Petrum haereticum appel∣laverat, et id Impetatori non indicaverit; quum certe id si Zenonem dilige∣ret, facere debuerit; Perinde sicut apparet, commodi ui desiderio Impera∣torem complectitur (as many Bishops in all ages did) fidem autem non comple∣ctitur. But they continuing in their Sees notwithstanding this Sentence, so far con∣temned the Popes and Synods Authority, that Acacius, Papae (Felicis) nomen ex sa∣cro albo exemit; which Flavitas afterwards upon a difference between him and Pe∣ter of Alexandria (who condemned the Synod of Chalcedon) suis ipse manibus in sa∣cris tabulis Mogge nomen expunxit,Ann 538 & Felicis appellationem reposuit. Peter continu∣ing Bishop still by the Emperors restitution and protection, notwithstanding the Popes and Roman Synods sentence of deprivation; Pope Gelasius (succeeding Felix) takes upon him to declare the Emperors restitution of Peter after his deprivation by a Synod, to be void, (if theSee Cookes Censura Patiū, & Dr. James Bastardy of the Fathers Decrees and Epistles be his own, and not forged, as I suspect, by the stile and subject matter, improper to, and unknown in that age) upon these mistaken Papal grounds:Surius Concil: Tom. 2. p. 300. to 310. Imperatori tantum de humanis rebus judi∣care permissum est, non etiam praeesse divinis: quomodo de his, per quos divina ministrantur judicare praesumant? Fuerint haec ante adven∣tum Christi, ut quidam figuraliter, adhuc tamen in carnalibus actionibus constituti, pariter Reges existerent et pariter Sacerdotes; quod SanctumGen. 14. Heb. 7. Melchi∣sedechem fuisse sacra prodit historia: Quod in suis quoque Diabolus imitatus est, utpotè qui semper quae divino cultui convenirent, sibimet tyrannico spiritu vindicare contendit, ut Pagani Imperatores, iidem et maximi Pontifices crea∣rentur. Sed cum ad verum ventum est eundem Regem atque Pontifi∣cem, ultra sibi nec Imperator Pontificis nomen imposuit, nec Pon∣tifer Regale fastigium vindicavit: (In that age 'twas true, but divers Here, p. 34, to 40. 79, 80. Popes since have usurped it as of right) Quamvis enim membra ipsius veri Regis atque Pontificis, secundum participationem naturae, magnificè utrumque in sacra ge∣nerositate sumpsisse dicantur, ut1 Pet. 2. simul Regale genus et Sacerdotale subsi∣stant; attamen Christus memor fragilitatis humanae, quod suorum saluti congruerit dispensatione magnifica temperans, sic actionibus propriis, dignitatibusque destinatis officia potestatis utriusque dis∣crevit, suos volens medicinali humilitate salvari, non humana superbia rursus in∣tercipi, ut et Christiani Imperatores pro aeterna vita Pontificibus in∣digerent, (as to their doctrin, instruction, advice, not supream inherent Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction) et Pontifices pro temporalium cursu rerum dispositionibus (yea of Ecclesiastical and divine too, as the premised and subsequent Authorities infalli∣bly evidence, though this Pope here denyes it) uterentur, quatenus: spiritu∣alis actio a carnalibus distaret incursibus:2 Tim. 2. Et ideo, militans Deo mi∣nime se negotiis secularibus implicaret (why then do all Popes, and most Bi∣shops the contrary?) ac vicissim, nolle rebus divinis praesidere videa∣tur, qui esset negotiis secularibus implicatus: (his Argument holds not, è converso, since all Christians, especially Kings, ought to meddle with divine matters, and things of faith, without which they can neither know, serve, worship God, or be saved themselves, nor govern their Christian subjects as they ought) et ut modestia utriusque ordinis conaretur, ne extolleretur utro∣que sufultus, et competens qualitatibus actionum, specialiter pro∣fessio aptaretur, (From which mistaken premises, this Pope draws this conclusion; (one of the first I meet with directly opposing the Emperors Ecclesiastical Authority, except that of St. Ambrose, in a different case, when Emperors command things di∣rectly
against God and the Scriptures) Quibus omnibus rite collectis, evi∣denter satis ostenditur a seculari potestate nec ligari prorsus, nec solvi posse Pontificem. Quo manifestius approbatur, Alexandrinum Petrum per Imperialem solummodo sententiam nullo modo potuisse absolvi: being condemned, deprived by the Synod at Rome & Pope Felix: ubi si Pontificum quo{que} sociatur assensus, quaerimus utrum praecesserit, an fuerit subsecutus? Si subsecutus est, nihilominus ad id reditur; ut absolutio seculari potestate praecepta, et prin∣cipaliter inchoata, valere non possit: pontificumque secutus assen∣sus, adulationis potius fuerat, quam legitimae sanctionis. Si prae∣cessit, doceatur a quibus, & ubi ille sit gestus, secundum Ecclesiae regulam celebratus; si paterna traditione profectus, si majorum more prolatus, si competenti examinatione de∣promptus? Ubi proculdubio requirendum est, Si Synodali congregatione celebratus, quod in receptione damnati, & depulsione catholici, quia nova est causa, fieri debuisse certissimum est. In fine, he concludes, that Peter and Acacius being condemned a prima sede, (by which he means the See and Council of Rome) could not be absolved nor resto∣red by the Emperor himself, nor by a Synod of the Clergy held at Constantinople, or elswhere, but only by the See of Rome, nec ab inferiore quolibet (praecipue cum de secundae sedis ageretur Antistite, to wit, Acacius of Constantinople) sed a prima sede jure possit absolvi. Inferior quippe potiorem absolvere non potest: sola ergo potior inferiorem convenien∣ter absolvit. A doctrin inconsistent with the practise and proceedings of that age, as the premises, and the deprivations, restitutions of many Bishops by the Emperors, as well Orthodox as Heterodox, recorded by Eusebius, Socrates Scholasticus, Sozomen, Tripartita Historia, Nicephorus, and others, abundantly evidence. This Pope Gelasius in hisSurius Con∣cil. Tom. 2. p. 301, 302. Commonitorium ad Faustum, his Legate sent to Constantinople, hath the like passages: Quod si dicunt, Imperator hoc fecit (that he restored Peter and Acacius) hoc ipsum quibus canonibus, quibus regulis est praeceptum? As if Emperors must do nothing but what Popes and Bishops prescribe, or permit them by their Canons. In his Epi∣stle toIbid. p. 303, 304. Anastasius the Emperor about the same businesse; after this complement Romanus natus, Romanum Principem amo, colo, suspicio, & sicut Christianus cum eo, qui zelum Dei habet, secundum scientiam veritatis habere desidero, & qualiscumque Apostoli∣cae sedis Vicarius (a phrase not usual in that age) quodcunque plenae fidei catholicae deesse comperero, pro meo modulo snggestionibus opportunis supplere contendo; He thus proceed Pietatem tuam absit (quaeso à Romano Principe) ut intimatam suis sensibus veritatem, ar∣bitretur injuriam.Gratian Di∣stinctio 96. Duo quippe sunt, Imperator Auguste, quibus princi∣paliter Mundus hic regitur, authoritas sacra Pontificum, et Rega∣lis potestas. In quibus tanto gravius est pondus sacerdotum, quanto etiam pro ipsis regibus hominum in Divino reddituri sunt examine rationem, (And must not Kings too give an account for Bishops and Priests under them, if they permit unworthy ones, or enforce them not by their Lawes to discharge their pastoral duties? No doubt they must.) Nosti etenim fili Clementissime, quod licet praesideas humano generi dignitate, rerum ta∣men Praesulibus divinarum devotus colla submittis (this is untrue in point of Jurisdiction) at{que} ab eis causas tuae salutis expetis (as from his Ministers, not Superiors) inque sumendis Coelestibus Sacramentis eis∣que (ut competit) disponendis subdi te debere cognoscis (in point on∣ly of Administration, not of Power or Jurisdiction) religionis ordine po∣tius quam praeesse. Itaque inter haec ex illorum te Pendere Judicio (as his Advisers, not Superiors) non illos ad tuam velle redigi voluntatem, (unless in case of their Heresie, Error, Excesses which he may reform) Si enim, quantum ad ordinem pertinet Publicae disciplinae, cognoscentes imperium tibi superna dispositione collatum, legi∣bus tuis ipsi quoque parent religionis Antistites, (he should have added with Gratian Dist. 10, 12. unlesse they thwart their Canons and profit) Ne vel in rebus mundanis exclusae videantur obviare sententiae; quo (rogo) te decet affectu eis obedire qui praerogandis venerabilibus sunt attri∣buti Mysteris: (in dispensing those mysteries only according to Gods word, not in unjust Church-censures.) Proinde sicut non leve discrimen incumbii Pontificibus siluisse pro divinitatis cultu quod congruit; ita his (quod absit) non mediocre periculum est, qui cum pare∣re
debeant, defficiunt. (That is, when & where God himself commands things in his word, not Popes and Prelates alone, enjoyn things different from, or not warranted by it:) Et cunctis generaliter Sacerdotibus, recte divina tractantibus (this ltation had been fit in, and must be applied to all his precedent clauses, else, they are false and hetero∣dox) fidelium convenit corda submitii; quanto potius sedis illius Praesuli con∣sensus est adhibendus (here is the great Diana of the Ephesians) quam cunctis Sacerdotibus et divinitas summa voluit praeminere (a grosse untruth warran∣ted by no sacred Text, but contradicted by many) et subsequens Ecclesiae gene∣ralis jugiter pietas celebravit? (another Papal forgery) Ubi pietas tua evidenter advertit,Mat. 16. nunquam quolibet  humano consilio elvare se quemquam posse illius privilegio, vel confession quem Christi vor praetulit universis, (a grosse un∣truth) quem Ecclesia veneranda semper confessa est, et habet devota prima∣tem. I peti possunt humanis praesumptionbus, quaed vino sunt judicio constituta, (but not by Popes, Bishops, and their Synods alone, the things then in question) Vinci autem quorumlibet potestate non possunt, &c. Yet all these Arguments would not per∣swade the Emperor Zeno, nor yet Anastatius to remove either Timothy or Aca∣cius from their Bishopricks, but they continued in them till their deaths, asHist. l. 16. c. 19. 2. Nicephorus informs us. I have inserted these Passages attributed to Pope Gelasius, more largely, and discovered their falshood and fallaciousnesse, because the first I meet with of this kind (if as ancient as Gelasius) and much insisted on in after ages by Popes and other Impugners of Emperors and Kings Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions. Theodulus Bishop of Coelosyria in his Commentary in Epist. ad Romanos,Anno 490 c. 13. omnis anima potestatibus praeminentibus subdatur, &c.Bibliotheca Patrum Tom. . pars 3. p. 579, 80. resolves: Monstrat, Christi Evangelium, non ad publicae bonae ordinationis subversionem datum esse. Ne sese deteriores viliore{que} reddi, Christi servi arbitrantur si potestatibus subiiciantur, ostendit quod necessarium sit obtemperare et non reluctare, neque inobedientem esse quem∣piam Magistratui: Qui enim istuc attemptaverit Deo resistit, qui condidit instituit∣que Magistratus. Necessarium est igitur Magistratui subjici, non solum propter iram, Magistratui subditis obvenientem; se etiam propter conscientiam; hoc est, ut ne videaris conscientia vacare, et ingratus esse benefactori ac Ministro Dei, si non obtemperes potestati. Tantis, inquit, beneficiis vos perfundit Magistratus ut & tributum pendatis, mercedem nimirum gubernationis praesidiatusque ejus: Ministri enim Dei sunt: Hoc est, suboperarii Dei sunt ministrantes sibi Principes ex hoc; quod curam subditorum gerunt. Neglectis suis privatis rebus publico suorum civium commodo invigi∣lant, &c. Non solum pecuniam debetis Magistratibus, sed etiam honorem. Rhemigius Archbishop of Rhemes,Anno 494 in his Commentary in Epist. ad Romanos cap. 13. thus determines:Bibliotheca Pa∣trum, Tom. 5. pars 3. p. 851, 852. Dixit Apostolus, Omnis anima, id est, Omnis homo, liber et servus, fidelis et infidelis, (therefore the Pope and Prelates) Potestatibus subli∣mioribus subditus sit. Omnis anima, dicit, pro eo quod, omnis homo, In sacra enim Scriptura frequenter sola anima totum hominem significat. Potestatibus sublimioribus dicit, Regibus, Principibus, Tribunis, Centurionibus, Dominis, om∣nibusque Praelatis. Hoc & Petrus praecepit, Subjecti, inquiens, estote omni huma∣nae creaturae, id est, omnibus hominibus vobis praepositis, & hoc propter Deum, sive prop∣ter amorem Dei, in quantum quippe homo non offendit Deum, &c. Omnis potestas sive major, sive minor, quae hominibus praeest, aut ex voluntate Dei, aut ex permissione Dei con∣stituta est: Then rendring the reasons of Gods instituting them, he concludes; Hac de causa omnipotens Deus bestialibus hominibus Principes praeposuit, ut eorum terrore acer∣bitas animorum illorum reprimeretur. Potestates super alios à Deo ordinatae sunt, sive quae sunt jura potestatum a Deo constituta sunt; unde Dominus dicit Pilato, Non haberes adversum me potestatem, nisi tibi data esset desuper: Hoc autem idcirco totum prosequitur Apostolus, ut Potestatibus subditi sint, quia nonnulli ad fidem venientes, pristinum obsequium & servitium, quasi libei effecti, Dominis et Principibus nolebant reddere. Cum Dominus Jesus non venit conditiones mutare, sed animas in aeternum victu∣ras salvare. Dicebant etiam Romani credentes, qui divinis legibus paremus, & Deo ser∣vimus non debemus servire, neque honorem praebere Neroni, aliisque potestatibus ter∣renis (the language of Popes and the Popish Clergy now even of Christian Emperors and Kings, whom they stile Prophane, Lay, Heretical, worldly) Quapropter Apostolus talia scrpsit iis, Poterat namque scandalum nasci Dominis et Principi∣bus, si servi et subjecti eorum Christiani effecti a servito illorum ef∣ficiantur
alieni: noceret quoque Ecclefiae dum permitterentur alii credere, cum magis meliores debeant Domini servos suos recipere fideles Christi effectos: Hoc & ipsa veritas per semet ipsum praecepit dicens Reddi∣te quae sunt Caesaris; Caesari; & quae sunt Dei, Deo. Which he there prosecutes at large.Mal. 22. And in Epist. 1 Tim. c. 2. he writes, Vult pro Regibus fieri rationes & gratiarum actiones;Bibl. Patrum, Tom. 5. par 3. p. 936. quam formam, id est, exemplum omnis Ecclesia nunc tent (be the Kings good or bad, Christians or Pagans, for sundry reasons which he prosecutes at large, and thus abridgeth;) Orandum est pro salute & vita fidelium Regum & Prin∣cipum, ut longo tempore conservati pacem habeant Regna, ac magis proficiant in me∣lius in omni pietate t castitate: Pro infidelibus quoque  est, ut resipiscant ab infidelitate, et transeant ad fidem: Hoc enim est bonum coram salvatori nostro Deo, qui vult omnes homines salvos fieri, & ad agnitionem veritatis venire: Especially Kings and Princes, the principal instruments to draw others to salvation, and the knowledge of the truth, by their Examples and Edicts. Surius Concil. Tom. 2. p. 334. Hermanni Contracti, Chron. con An∣no 503, 504. Platina, Lydi∣us, Anastatius, Sabellicus, in Symmacho. Pope Symnachus being accused of Adultery and other horrid facts to Theodoricus King of Italy,Anno 503, 504. Sancta Synodus apud urbent Romanam ex praecepto Gloriosissimi Regis Theodorici diversis regionibus congregata in Christi nomine est (this King not the Pope summoning this Council even in Rome it self.) Cum ex diversis Provinciis ad urbem Romam conveni∣re Sacerdotes Regia praecepisset authoritas, ut de his quae de vene∣rabili Papa Symmacho, Apostolici sedis praesul, ab adversariis ejus dicebantur impingi, sanctum Concilium judicaret egitime; Ligu∣riae, Aemiliae vel Venetiarum Episcopis, consulendi Regem incubuit ne∣cessitas, concerning this accusation: Who coming into the Kings presence respondit praefatus Rer piissimus bonae conversationis affectu, plu∣ra ad se de Papae Symmachi actibus horrenda fuisse perlata, et in Synodo oportere (si vera esset inimicorum ejus objectio) judicatione con∣stare. Whereupon the Examination of his crimes being referred to this 4th. (some reckon it the 3d.) Synod held at Rome, (and that by the Popes desire to purge himself, as well as by the Kings precept,) the Pope entred into the Synod; et de evocatione Synodali lementissimo Regi gratias re∣tulit, et rem desiderii sui evenisse testatus est. Upon his accusation to the King, he was suspended ab officio & beneficio, by this King; untill he had purged himself. At his first appearance before the Council, he com∣plained of this his suspension, as illegal, being not made by the Council, but out of it, and prayed to be readmitted and restored by the Council; et ut om∣nia quae per suggestiones inimicorum suorum (a parte Cleri vel ali∣quibus laicis) amiserat, potestati ejus legaliter ab honorabili Con∣cilio redintegrarentur seu redderenter, et tanti loci Praesul regula∣riter prius statui pristino redderetur; et tunc, non ante veniret ad causam: et si ita, recte videretur, accusantium propositionibus re∣sponderet. Digna res visa est maximo sacerdotum numero, quae mereretur effectum, decernere tamen aliquid Synodus sine Regia notitia non praesumpsit. Whereupon the Synod sent to the King to know his pleasure herein; Sed suggestionibus per legatorum negligentiam non meruit secundum vota responsum: (But contrary to the Synods desire and opinion) Iussus est Regis praeceptionibus Papa Symmachus ante Patrimonii vel Ec∣clesiarum (quas amiserat) receptionem, cum impugnatoribus su∣is in disceptatione confligere, qui potestatis suae privilegia, et quae pro conscientiae (quantum juste aestimamus) emendatione submise∣rat, nec hac voluit vice resumere. Whereupon it was thought meet that the Libel prepared against the Pope by his accusers, (qui quotidie sedi∣tionibus appellabant) should be received by the Synod: Which being recei∣ved accordingly and read, there appeared two things in it which seemed ei∣ther
false, or repugnant to their Ecclesiastical power: The one, that his Crimes whereof he stood accused apud Regiam constitit notitiam, were pending before the Kings own conusans; which was false, he having refer∣red him to the Council: The second, that they could prove him guilty of the Crimes objected by his servants; addentes, ut ipse mancipia traderet, qui∣bus (quantum illi disserebant) posset in judicatione superari: Quae res Canonibus & ipsis publicis erat legibus inimica, &c. Et dam inter ista quae essent facienda, tractabatur, praefatus Papa, ut causam diceret occurrebat. Qui veniens, abirruentibus turbis aemulorum suorum ita tractatus est, ut multis Presbyteris, qui cum ipso erant, per cadem ipsam mortis fuisset occasio; quod probat recentium ad∣huc vestigia vulnerum, nisi illustris vir Comes Alegerius, & sublimes viri Gutela & Vedecelsus, Majores domus Regiae, perspexissent, quos secum, un∣de egressus fuerat ad beati Petri Apostoli septa convexerat. Upon these tumults and confusions, the Synod reported the whole series of their proceedings to the King as Supream Judge; iterum Nos ad Iustitiam contulimus principalem, scientes vivinitare propitia regere Dominum, quem ad gubernacula Itaiae ipse providerat. They informed the King; Saepe nominatum Papam (post caedem, cui subjacuerat cum suis) si vo∣luntatem rursus haberet ereundi ad judicium, fuisse commonitum; but that he could not canonically purge himself without great dangers; and that by reason of the tumults of his accusers who resisted justice, he could not be compelled to answer against his will. Ad haec serenissimus Rex taliter (Deo adspirante) respondit, in Synodali esse arbitrio, in tanto negotia sequen∣da praescribere, nec aliquid ad se praeter reverentiam de Ecclesiasticis negotiis pertinere, committens etiam potestati Pontificum, ut sive propositum vellent audire negotium, sive nollent, quod magis pu∣tarent utile deliberarent, dummodo venerandi provisione Concilii par in Civitate Romana Christianis omnibus redderetur. Where∣upon the Synod by vertue of this reference from the King, thought best to proceed no further in the examination of the fact, but to referre the cause to Gods judgement, acquainting the Roman Senate with their resolutions, and desiring them to consider, quanta inconvenienter et praejudicialiter in hujus negotii principio contigissent; That all men are sinners, and have need of Gods mercy, and that the examining of this cause would do more preju∣dice and dishonor, then good to the Church. Wherefore, juxta mandatum Principis non discuterent; but referr the whole cause to God the Judge of secret things, and so acquitted him from thePlatina, Ana∣statius, Luit∣pan, Lydi∣us, Sabellicus, in Symmacho 1. Articles exhibited against him, as to men. Vnde secundum Principalia praecepta, quae nostrae hoc tribuunt pote∣stati, quicquid Ecclesiastici inter sacram Vrbem Romae; vel foris Iuris est, reformamus, totamque causam Dei judicio reservantes, universos horta∣mur ut sacram communionem (sicut res postulat) ab eo percipiant, & Dei & animarum suarum meminerint; quia & ipse amator pacis est, & ipse Pax est, qui monet,John 4. Mat. 10. Pa∣cem meam do vobis, &c. From these memorable proceedings against this Pope, it is most evident, 1. That the Pope in this age was subject and submitted himself to the Judicature, not only of the Emperor, but of Thedoricus the Gothish King of Italy, (who removed Symmachus and Laurentius from the Papacie contending for it, and placed Peter Altinat ther∣in to appease the Schism, till the cause between them was heard) and to a Council of Bishops, even for scandalous crimes objected against him. 2ly. That the Power of summoning Councils even in Rome it self appertained to this King of Italy, not to the Pope. 3ly. That the King upon the complaints exhibited to him against the Pope, suspended him both from his temporalties, benefices and Papal office by his Regal au∣thority before the Council summoned, till he had purged himself from the Crimes ob∣jected. 4ly. That though most of the Synod held it just this Pope should not answer the Articles against him, till he was first restored to his Patrimony, benefice and of∣fice,
yet they would determine nothing therein, till this Kings approbation, & plea∣sure first known. 5ly. That the King would not take off this Popes Suspension, till he answered his Articles, and purged himself, notwithstanding the Synods request and opinion to the contrary. 6ly. That thereupon they received and read the Articles against him. 7ly. That the Pope appeared by this Kings summons before this Coun∣cil to answer the crimes against him: where at his appearance, he denies to answer in point of Law, till his Suspension first released, and his restitution: which the Emperor overruled against him. After which he appeared the second time upon Summons to answer the Articles, and purge himself; but was interrupted by the tu∣multuous force and assaults of his accusers, made upon him and his followers, who were wounded, and had been slain by them, had not the Kings Great Officers rescu∣ed them from their fury, and guarded them back to their lodgings: That after this upon new Summons, the Pope was willing to answer, and purge himself before the Synod, but that he was informed, he could not do it without danger of being slain by his tumultuous opposites. 8ly. That the Synod thereupon repaired to the King, as the Supream Judge, to direct them how to proceed in this cause, by reason of these Tu∣mults. 9ly. That thereupon the King referred the whole businesse to them, to proceed therein as they should think best for the Peace of the Church, and of all Chri∣stians in the City of Rome. 10ly. That they hereupon by vertue of this Kings re∣gal authority and command, (not their own inherent Episcopal or Synodal Jurisdicti∣on) referred the merits of the cause, being secret and difficult, to Gods judgement, and restored the Pope to his Ecclesiastical Rights and exercise of his Ministry with∣in the City of Rome; and perswaded an amicable Christian peace and agreement be∣tween him, his adversaries, the Senate and Citizens of Rome: Where then is that transcendent Jurisdiction of Popes over Kings, Councils, all other Bishops, and his absolute exemption from their Judicatures for any scandalous sins or heresies, which succeeding Popes and their Parasites boast of, in theHer, p. 36, to 40. premised Chapters? To evade this undeniable president,Apologia pro Symmacho, p. 293. Baronius, Anno 502, n. 32, &c. Ennodius, and other flatterers of Popes, pretend, That Pope Symmachus out of meer humility, and of his own accord, submitted himself to this Kings and Councils Judgement. But the premises evidence the contrary, that most of these proceedings (especially his Suspension, overruling of his demurrer, &c.) were much against his will; and that he had no real desire to purge himself, what ever he pretended: And John Gerson Chancellor of Paris (one of the learnedest, profound∣est Pontificians) in his notable Book De Auferibilitate Papae,De Conside¦ratio, c. 2. resolves; That Sym∣machus, and other Popes did undergo the judgements of Councils, nequaquam ex hu∣mili condescentione, sicut nonnulli fingunt, sed ex debito et obligatione. Yea this Pope himself in hisTom. 3. Bibl. Patrum. Apology to Anastatius the Emperor, stiles him Principem rerum humanarum: adding, Thou, O Emperor; governest human and secular affairs, Bishops dispence the divine Mysteries; without any addition, that Bishops govern all Ecclesiastical affairs, which this King and the Emperor then did in Italy, not Popes nor Bishops. ThisFridericus Lin∣debrogus Code Legum Antiq. p. 246, &c. Theodoricus King of Italy made and published divers Ecclesiastical Lawes,Anno 508 intermixed with his Temporal, concerning Clergy-men, Churches, Sanctuaries, Pa∣gan Sacrifices, Sepulchers, and burials in Rome it self, Marriages, Espousals, Jews, the observation of the Lords day, &c. commanding them to be generally observed by his Edictum Theodorice Regis, Lex 26. 70. 71. 92. 93. 108. 110. 111. 125, 126. and that as well by the Romans as Barbarians and Goths, under pain of banishment, if vio∣lated, Quia quod pro omnium provincialium securitate provisum est, universitatis debet servare devotio. Cassiodorus,Anno 510. a Noble learned Roman Senator, (tutor to this King Theodoricus) in his Exposition in Psal. 50. Tibi soli peccavi, hath this passage. De populo si quis errave∣rit, & Deo peccat & Regi: Nam quando Rex delinquit, soli Deo reus est, quia ho∣minem non habet qui eius facta diudicet: Merito ergo Rer Deo dicit se solum peccasse, quia solus erat qui eius potuisset admissa discutere.

But they taking this message in high indignation and scorn, put the messengers into an old leaking Ship, and Anastatius commanded them to return directly into Italy, and not to touch upon the shoare of Grece, enjoyning them to return this answer to the Pope; Scire se Augustorum (or Imperatoris) proprium esse, non Pontificis imperare; nec Impe∣rata Pontificis accpiere: et si quid foret, in quo hunc, cui divina curae sunt, jubere oporteat, se eum esse, a quo alii multo melius sua jussa expectent, quam sua proponant exequenda.

Quid enim gratius reperiri potest, quid justius, quid illustrius, quam quos idem Regnum continet, idemque fidei cultus irradiat, eos non diversa contendere, sed collectis in eisdem sensibus instituta venerari, non humana mente illata, sed in divinae providentiae spiritu. This Pope in his Epistle to Epiphanius Bi∣shop of Constantinople, hath this memorable passage,Surius Tom. 2. p. 366, 369 370. Hinc enim supernae misericordiae documentum perdocetur, quoniam et mundeni Principes causas fidei, cum reipublicae ordinatione conjungunt, as a principal part of their care, and best means of their safety and prosperity in all their secular affairs.

His Supream Ecclesiastical Power was evidenced by summoning Synods, Coun∣cils, and presiding in them;Ecclesiasticae, Hist. l. 17. c. 27 Nicephorus Callistus records, Imperator Justinianus, sanctam quintam Synodum Oecumenicam, Episcopis Ecclesia∣rum omnium evocatis, coegit. And himself in his Letters of Sum∣mons issued for convening the 5. General Council of Constantinople (recorded by Concil. Tom. 2. p. 494, 495 496. Laurentius Surius, Binius and Crab in their Collections of Councils) thus relates the summoning of all the former General Councils, and confirmation of their De∣crees by all Christian Emperors his predecessots, which occasioned him to summon this 5. General Council by his Edict. In Nomine Domini Dei nostri Jesu Christi, Imperator Caesar Flavius Justinianus, &c. Beatissimis Episcopis & Patriarchis, &c. Semper studium fuit orthodoxis et piis Imperatoribus patribus nostris pro tempore exortas haereses per Congregationem religiosissimorum Episcoporum amputare, et recta fide syncere praedicata in pace sanctam Dei Ecclesiam custodire. Quapropter & Constantinus Prae recordationis, Arrio blasphemante & dicente non esse
Filium consubstantialem Deo Patri, sed creaturam, & ex non extantibus factum esse, con∣gregavit Niceae ex diversis Diocesibus trecentos Decem et Octo sanctos patres; et cum ipse etiam Concilio interfuisset, et adjuvisset eos quod Consubstantialem filium Patri confessi sunt, condemnata Arriana impietate, studium habuit rectam fidem obtinere. Exposito itaque Sancto Symbolo vel Mathemate fidei, per hoc Sancti Patres confessi sunt, consub∣stantialem esse Filium Deo Patri, quod usque tunc apud plurimos dubitabatur. Sed et Theodosius senior piae recordationis, Macedonio negante Deitatem sancti Spiritus, et Apollinario vel Magno ejus Discipulo, in Dispensatione incarnati Dei verbi blasphemantibus, & dicentibus sensum humanum, non recipisse Deum verbum, sed Carni unitum esse animam irrationabilem habenti; congre∣gatis in regia Vrbe Centum Quinquaginta Sanctis Patribus, cum et ipse particeps fuisset Concilii, damnatis praedictis Haereticis, una cum impiis eorum dogmatibus, fecit rectam praedicare fidem. Se∣cuti enim iidem Sancti Patres expositam rectam fidem a trecentis Decem et Octo sanctis Patribus explanaverunt de Deitate sancti Spiritus, et perfecte de dispensatione incarnati Dei verbi docuerunt. Iterum Nestoo Impio alium dicente Deum verbum, & alium Christum, & huncquidem natura felium Dei Patris, illum autem gratia filium in piè introducente, & sanctam Glo∣riosam semper Virginem Dei Genitricem esse negante, cum penè omnes Orientales partes sua impietate adimplesset idem Nestorius, Theodosius junior piae recordationis congregavit priorem Ephesinam sanctam Synodum, cui praesidebant Coelestinus, et Cyrillus Sancti Patres, & directis Iudicibus qui deberent Concilio interesse, compulit et ipsum Nestorium ibi pervenire, et Iudicium propter eum procedere, et tali examinatione facta, secuti iidem sancti Patres per omnia ea quae de Fide definita sunt ab anterioribus sanctis Patribus condemnaverunt Nestorium, una cum ejus impietate. His ita subsecutis, cum insurrexissent contra Cyrillum sequaces Nestorii impii, fesinaverunt (quantum in ipsis fuit) refutare condemnationem contra Nestorium factam: sed praedictus piae recordationis Theodosius, Vindicans ea quae ita recte contra Nestorium et ejus impietatem fuerant iudicata, fecit firmiter obti∣nere contra eum factam condemnationem. Et post haec iterum cum Eu∣tichius demens emersisset, negando consubstantialem nobis esse carnem Domini, multis interea motis, tam Constantinopoli, quam Ephesi, tanta pro illa facta est Haereticorum circumventio, ut etiam ejiceretur propter eum Flavianus Reli∣giosae memoriae Regiae Vrbis Episcopus.Nota. Piae autem recordationis Martianus congregavit Chalcedone sanctos Patres, et Magna con∣tentione inter Episcopos facta, non solum per suos Iudices, sed eti∣am per seipsum in Concilium pervenit, et ad concordiam omnes per∣durit. Cui sancti Patres in omnibus secuti ea quae pro fide definita sunt apraedictis tribus sanctis Conciliis, et quae judicata sunt de Hae∣reticorum damnatione et impietate eorum, damnaverunt et anathe∣matizaverunt Eutichen dementem, et impia ejus dogmata, necnon et Nestorium cum impiis ejus dogmatibus, quoniam tunc festinave∣runt quidam defendere Nestorium et impia ejus dogmata. Super haec autem iidem in Chalcedone sancti Patres anathematizaverunt eos qui aliud Symbolum tradiderunt aut tradunt, praeter hoc quod expositum est a trecentis decem et octo sanctis Patribus, et explana∣tum a Centum quinquaginta sanctis Patribus. His itaque omni∣bus, per diversa tempora subsecutis praedicti piae recordationis nostri Patres ea quae in Vnoquoque Concilio judicata sunt Legibus suis corroboraverunt et confirmaverunt,Nota. et Haereticos qui definitionibus praedictorum sanctorum quatuor Conciliorum resistere, et Ecclesias conturbare conati sunt, expulerunt. Defuncto autem Martiano Divae Re∣cordationis, cum Contentio esset per diversa loca de Chalcedonensi sancto Conci∣lio.
Leo piae recordationis ad omnes ubique Sacerdotes scripsit, ut unus∣quisque eorum propriam sententiam manifestaret de eodem Sancto Concilio, & cum alius alium Episcopum non expectasset, ad hoc quod interrogati sunt responderunt. Exiguo autem tempore transacto iterum insurrexerunt Nestorii & Eutichis sequaces & tantas turbas in sanctis Dei Ecclesiis fecerunt, ut divisiones, & schismata in eis fierent, & nullam communionem adse invicem Ecclesiae haberent. Nec enim prae∣sumebat aliquis de Civitate ad Civitatem veniens communicare, nec Clericus ex a∣lia Civitate in aliam Civitatem veniens in Ecclesiam procedere. Cum autem secundum suam Misericordiam Dominus Deus Reipublicae Guber∣nationem nobis credivit, initium et fundamentum nostri Imperii feci∣mus, conjungere divisos Sacerdotes sanctarum Dei Ecclesiarum, ab Oriente usque ad Occidentem, et omnem contentionem ampu∣tantes quae contra Chalcedonensem sanctam Synodum ab Eutychis et Nestorii impiorum sequacibus movebatur, fecimus praedicare ean∣dem sanctam Synodum, cum praedictis aliis sanctis tribus Conci∣liis in Dei Ecclesiis, certe scientes, quod ea quae ab ea de fide expo∣sita sunt, consonant per omnia aliis tribus sanctis Conciliis, et mul∣tis quidem ad eandem sanctam Synodum contradicentibus satis∣fecimus, alios aut qui perseveraverunt eidem sancto Concilio con∣tradicentes extulimus a sanctis Dei Ecclesiis et Venerabilibus Monasteriis, ut concordia et pace sanctarum Ecclesiarum et earum Sacerdotum firmiter custodita, una et eadem fides quam sanctae qua∣tuor Synodi confessae sunt, in sanctis Dei Ecclesiis praedicetur. His ita pro firmitate sanctarum quatuor Synodorum Deo propitio per nos factis et obtinentibus in sancta Dei Ecclesia, Nestorii sequaces propriam impietatem applicare volentes sanctae Dei Ecclesiae, et non potentes hoc per Nestorium facere, festinaverunt ea introducere per Theodorum Mopsuestenum Doctorem Nestorii, qui multo pejora Nestorio blasphemavit, et super alias innumerabiles suas Blasphe∣mias, contra Christum Deum nostrum factas, alium dixit Deum verbum, alium Christum, nec non et per impia conscripta Theo∣dori quae contra rectam fidem et Ephesinam primam sanctam Syno∣dum, et contra sanctae memoriae Cyrillum et duodecim ejus capi∣tula exposuit, et insuper sceleratam Epistolam, quam dicitur Ibas ad Marim Persam scripsisse, quae plena est omni impietate Theo∣dori et Nestorii. Per hanc etenim impiam Epistolam non solum impietatem, sed etiam ipsas personas Theodori & Nestorii, quas maxime laudat & judicat, eadem impia Epistola festinaverunt condemnationem liberare, dicentes eam susceptam esse à Sancta Chalcedonensi Synodo. Hoc autem dicunt non pro defensione sanctae Sy∣nodi sed nomine ejus sicut putant, suam impietatem confirmare festinantes. Cer∣tum autem est, quod impia intentio est ista vindicantium, ut si eis evenerit, non praedicetur Deus verbum homo factus esse, nec sancta Gloriosa semper Virgo Ma∣ria Dei Genitrix praedicetur. Haec enim Theodorus & Nestorius in suis Con∣scriptis impie exposuerunt, & qui Epistolam scripsit, in eablasphemat. Nos i∣gitur sequentes sanctos Patres, et volentes rectam fidem sine qua∣dam macula in Dei Ecclesiis praedicari, et impiorum conatum re∣secare, primum quidem et in vestris vos degentes Ecclesiis inter∣rogavimus de praedictis tribus capitulis, et vestram nobis volunta∣tem manifestam fecistis, pro qua et comprobavimus vos, quod in∣dubitanter et cum omni alacritate rectam fidem confessi estis, et im∣piam condemnastis. Quoniam vero et post condemnationem a vobis factam in eisdem ipsis permanent quidam eadem impia tria
Capitula vindicantes, ideo vocavimus vos ad regiam Vrbem, hor∣tantes, communiter convenientes, quam habetis pro his volunta∣tem, iterum manifestare, &c. Adhortamur igitur etiam vos de his disceptare: Scire etenim vos volumus, quod nos ea quae a Sanctis quatuor Conciliis, Niceno, Constantinopolitano, Ephesino primo, et Chalcedonensi de una eademque fide exposita et definita sunt, et de Ec∣clesiastico statu regulariter disposita, servabimus et defendemus, et ea sequimur, et omnia quae consonant istis suscipimus et amplecti∣mur. Quicquid autem non consonat istis, vel a quacunque persona scriptum inveniatur contra ea quae de una eadem{que} fide a sanctis qua∣tuor Conciliis, vel uno ex his, definita sunt, hoc tanquam alienum, omnino pietatis execramur; sequimur autem in omnibus sanctos pa∣tres et Doctores sanctae Dei Ecclesiae, id est, Athanasium, Hilarium, Basilium, Gregorium Theologum, & Gregorium Nyssenum, Ambrosium, Theophilum, Johann. (Chrysostomum) Constantinopolitanum, Cyrillum, Au∣gustinum, Proculum, Leonem, & omnia quae ab his de fide recta, & ad condem∣nationem Haereticorum conscripta & exposita sunt, suscipimus, &c. After which he prescribes the Bishops what points they should debate in this General Council, and then concludes; Omnia igitur praedicta cum omni subtilitate dis∣ceptantes, sicut Sacerdotes decet, in mente habentes Dei timorem, & futurum judi∣cium, & nihil pietati & rectae fidei & veritati, & Dei gloriae & honori praepo∣nentes, in mente autem habentes et Apostolicam pronuntiationem quae contra eos qui contraria rectae fidei tradunt prolata est, manifeste dicentem,Gal: 1. 8, 9. quod licet Nos vel An∣gelus de Coelo evangelizaverit vobis praeterquam quod evangelizavimus vobis, ana∣thema sit, scientes autem & Petri Apostoli praeceptum dicentis,1 Pet. 3. 15 Parati semper estote ad satisfactionem omni petenti vos rationem de spe quae in vobis est, celeriter de his quae interrogavimus vestram manifestate volunta∣tem. Cum enim qui de recta fide interrogatur diu protrahit, nihil aliud est nist abnegatio rectae confessionis. In this Council the Emperor appointed some of hisSurius, Tom: 2. p. 501, 502. Nobles and Judges to be presidents, to take an account of, and direct the Bishops in their procee∣dings: who after Pope Vigilius his refusal to appear in the Council; Glorio∣sissimi Iudices dixerunt, Nos quidem hoc quod jussi sumus à piissimo Impera∣tore implevimus, & imus ad ejus palatium in ejus obsequium permansuri; vos autem Dei timorem prae oculis habentes celerem finem imponere causae dignamini, conveni∣entem his quae a sanctis quatuor Conciliis de fide recta definita sunt, sci∣entes quod piissimus Imperator specialiter jussit nobis dicere ve∣strae Sanctitati, quod ipse quae a sanctis quatuor Conciliis de una ea∣demque fide definita et judicata sunt, et servavit, et servat, et vin∣dicavit, et vindicat, et omnia quidem quae conveniunt his quae ab iisdem Sanctis Conciliis pro recta fide definita sunt, et suscipit et servat; omnia autem contraria his quae ab ipsis de fide recta judi∣cata sunt, et rejicit, et aliena de Ecclesia judicat esse.

Chapters; who yet (as the Council attests, andDe Conciliis, l. 1. c. 4. 36. Bellarmin, andAnnal. Ec∣cles. Ann. 553. nu. 29, 31.

Nec enim justum est tam Christianissimum Imperatorem vel fidelem populum scandalizare ex dilatione ejus, upon pretence, that there were many Eastern Bishops there, pauci vero cum eo:
facere autem per semetipsum in scriptis suam sententiam, & offerre piissimo Domino (so he stiled Iustinian) Ideo enim & inducias postulasse ab ejus Serenitate, ut intra eas suam manifestaret sententiam. During the Councils Sessions, Pope Vigilius published his Apostolical Constitution, and definitive sentence in defence of the Three Chap∣ters: Which Constitution and sentence of his, this General Council contradicted, ana∣thematised even in the cause of faith, censuring his definitive opinion as heretical; condem∣ning the Catholick faith, and justifying the heresie of Nestorius, asDe Pontif: Rom. l. 4. c. 10. Dr Craken∣thorps Vigilius Dormitans, c. 2. 3, 4. Bellarmin himself confesseth: All the godly Bishops in the cloze of the 6. Collation cryed out unanimous∣ly; Surius, Tom: 2. p. 579. Multis Annis Imperatorem, orthodoxum Imperatorem multis an∣nis. And in the Conclusion of the 7. Session or Collation they all give him this Enco∣mium: Ibidem. p.] 588. Sancta Synodus dixit, Evidenter et nunc Deum placans intentio pi∣issimi et tranquillissimi Imperatoris ostensa est, qui omnia semper fecit, et facit quae sanctam Ecclesiam et recta dogmata conservant, qui et modo recitatas Chartas direxit manifestantes et ipsas, quod nec latuit aliquem alienam ab initio esse istorum Capitulorum im∣pietatis sanctam Dei Ecclesiam. Et Christianissimus quidem Im∣perator mercedem pro his habebit de Christo magno Deo, qui talia multiplicare solet: nos autem Orationes quotidianas facientes pro ejus Serenitate, pro tribus Capitulis altero die adjuvante Deo Sy∣nodicam sententiam proferemus. This Emperor ratifying the defini∣tions of this Council by his royal assent and Decrees,Surius Con∣cil: Tom. 2. p. 387, to 400 afterwards writ a Confession of his own faith; wherein he refutes and anathematizeth all Heresies con∣demned by former Councils, in nature of an Imperial Decree, which he enjoyned to be observed within his Empire, sending it to Pope John the 2d. and approved by Pope Agatho his Successor, printed in Surius with this Title; Edictum Piissimi Impera∣toris Justiniani, fidei Confessionem continens, & refutationem haereseos quae adversantur Catholicae Ecclesiae, &c. With this Note in the Margin; Confessio Justiniani Impe∣ratoris, Erudito, Pio, et Catholico Imperatore digna. The ground of his compiling and publishing it, is thus expressed in the Prologue: Scientes quod nihil aliud sic potest misericordem Deum placare, quam ut omnes Christiani unum idemque sa∣piant in recta & immaculata fide, nec sint dissentiones in sancta Dei Ecclesia; necessari∣um putavimus, &c. to compile and publish this his Edict and Confession of Faith for these ends. Upon reading whereofSurius Tom. 2 p. 399. Pontianus, a Bishop, writ thus to him. Ex∣ultat autem spiritus noster hoc firmiter te piissime esse Imperator, quod Apostolica fides praedicat, credentes: quod à rectae credulitatis tramite non declines.

If this whole General Council, together with the Synods of Rome, Millain, the Emperor Constantine, Pope Agatho himself and other godly Bishops gave these high Encomiums of Justini∣ans transcendent piety, orthodoxy, constancy, learning and knowledge, within an 120. years after his decease, How impudent, impious, injurious is Cardinal Baronius a∣bove one thousand years after, to slander him for an Heretical, in pious, flagitious, illiterat, damned miscreant? 10ly.Epist: l. 2.

Ju∣stin. l. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Procopius gives him this Encomium, That Justini∣an seemed to have been ordained to the Imperial dignity by God, that he might repair the whole Empire, and likewise the Church of God: For he built the most magnificent Church Sophia in Constantinople, comparable to Solomons Temple, the mirrour of all ages, with 37. Stately Churches in Constantinople, Antioch, Ierusalem, and other great Cities, besides many Abbies, Churches, Hospitals; so that Nulla satietas ho∣norandi Deum eum cepit, as Procopius relates, asserts. AndEccles: Hist: l. 4. c. 18. Zonarus Tom: 3. Evagrius (who being an Eutichian, was most despitefull to him) gives him this testimony, That it is re∣ported he restored a-new one hundred and fifty Cities, either totally overthrown or utterly decayed, and that he so beautified them with great Ornaments, publike and private houses, goodly walls, sumptuous buildings and Chur∣ches, ut nihil esse posset magnificentius. Which yet were nothing comparable to his most wholesom Imperial Lawes, (abridged, corrected, sup∣plied by his learned care and diligence) whereby he governed both the Empire and Church. 16ly.

That all the people annually celebrated the memory of Justini∣an with great Pomp, solemnity, and panegyrick Orations to his honor, both in the Church of Sophia in Constantinople, and in the Church of St. Iohn at Ephesus, which he built. And although Baronius out of malice place him in hell, yet PopeConcil. Gen. 6. Act. 4. Agatho
and his whole Roman Council, rank him among the glorious and blessed Saints in heaven, St. Constantine, Theodosius, and Martian; saying, That he is a blessed Saint venerable in all ages; and this Pope with the whole 6. General Council (asEccles: Hist: l: 7. c. 31.

LearnedVigilius Dor∣mitans ch. 20. p. 355. Dr. Crakenthorp gives this testimony of him; There cannot be found in all Scripture more fair evidence, nor a more authentick Charter for the happy estate of any one in particular, that lived since the Apostles times, then is for this Justinian; For what were the works which did ac∣company and follow him? Truly the works of sincere faith, of fervent zeal to God, of love to the Church and children of God, the works of piety, of prudence, of justice, of for∣titude, of munificence, of many other heroical vertues; with these, as with a garment and chain of pure gold, Justinian being decked, was brought unto the bridegroom. Every Decree made or ratified by him for confirming the truth; every Anathema against Here∣sies and hereticks, particularly those against Vigilius, and all that defend him (that is, against Baronius, and all that defend the Popes infallibility in defining matters of faith;) every Temple or Church, every Monastery and Hospital, eve∣ry City and Town, every Bridge, Haven, and Highway, every Ca∣stle, Fort and Munition, whether made or repaired by him, tending either immediately to the advancing of Gods service in strengthen∣ing the Empire against his and Gods enemies; Every Book in the Digest, Code, and Authenticks; every Title, yea every Law in every Title whereby the Christian faith or Religion, or preaceable order and tranquillity have been either planted or propagated, or continued in the Church, or Commonwealth; all these and every one of them, and many other the like, which I cannot either remember or recount, are like so ma∣ny Rubies, Chrysolites and Diamonds in the costly Garment, or so many links in the gol∣den chain of his faith and virtues; Seeing they who offer but one mite into the Trea∣sury of the Lord; or, give but one cup of cold water to a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall not want a reward; O what a weight of eternity and glory, shall that Troop of Vertues and Train of Good works obtain at his hands, who rewardeth indeed eve∣ry man according to their works; but withall rewardeth them infinitely above all the dignity or condignity of their works? I have the longer insisted in clearing Justinians Ecclesiastical Supremacy in matters of faith, worship, over all Ecclesiastical persons, and Popes themselves, with his pie∣ty as well as Regality in making, collecting the forecited Ecclesiastical Laws; be∣cause they are most punctual to my present Theam, and most oppugned by Baronius. Agapetus a famous learned Deacon of Constantinople, in his Admonitorium to the Emperor Justinian,Anno 550. hath these memorable passages, Honore quolibet sublimio∣rem quanto habeas dignitatem,Ad Justinianum Imp. jam Co∣ronatum Parae∣netica Oratio, Bibl. Patrum, Tom: 6. pars 1. p. 565, 566. O Imperator, honora supra omnes, qui hoc te dignatus est, Deum, quoniam juxta similitudinem caelestis Regni tradidit tibi sceptrum terrenae potestatis, ut homines doce∣as justi custodiam. Super omnia praeclara quae regnum habet, pietatis cultusque divini corona regem exornat. Sceptrum Im∣perii quam a Deo susceperis cogitato quibusnam modis placebis ei qui id tibi dedit; quumque omnibus hominibus ab eo sis praelatus (therefore above the Pope, and all other Prelates) magis omnibus eum honestare festina: porro id ipse honestamentum arbitratur maxi∣mum, si quasi te factos a se tuearis, atque ut debiti solutio∣nem benefaciendi munus adimpleas, &c. And he positively as∣serts; Essentia corporis aequalis cuilibet homini Imperator, po∣testate autem dignitatis cunctorum praesidi Deo, nec enim habet in terris se quenquam altiorem: oportet igitur ipsum ut De∣um, non irasci, ut mortalem non efferri &c. His Imperator non ha∣bet in terris se quenquam altiorem, making much against the Popes Supremacy, recited by Antonius Abbas (in his Melissa,) the Roman Censurers in their Index Expurgatorius, Romae excus: Anno 1607. p. 200. and the Spanish
Inquisitors in their Index librorum prohibitorum & expurgand. excus.

He adds, Imperator ut est omnium Dominus, (therefore the Popes) ita cum omnibus Dei servus existat: his whole Admonitorium tends to prove, that the advancement of Piety, Religion, and Gods Worship, is and ought to be all Kings, Emperors chiefest study, care, as well as honor and safety.Anno 5. Dr.  of the Popes Temp. Monar∣chy, c. 5. p. 71.

Chilpericus King of France accused Pretextatus Bishop of Rhoan for Theft, Treason against him, and divers other crimes, for which he declared se de jure in eum agere potuisse; but yet he summoned a Synod to examin and hear the cause, because he would not seem to crosse the Canons: whereupon a Synod being called at Paris, Gregorius Turonensis Episcopus (though a great favourer of Pretextatus,) thus inge∣nuously professed and told the King: Si quis de nobis (Episcopis) O Rex Justitiae tra∣mitem transcendere voluerit, a te corrigi potest; but if you transgresse them, who shall punish you? We speak unto you: If you be willing, you obey; but if you be unwil∣ling, who can condemn you, but he only who hath pronounced that he is iust? Not the Pope, nor a whole Synod of Bishops, as this Bishop confesseth. Pretextatus being convicted of the crimes by his own confession, was thereupon apprehended, imprisoned, and afterwards banished by this King, but recalled and restored by King Gunthram his Successor. This King Gunthram summoned a Synod at Lyons against Salonius Ebredunensis Episcopus,Anno . and Sagittarius Vaxiensis Episcopus,Amonius Hist: l. 3. c. 26, 27, 28. Greg. Tu∣tonensis, l. 5. c. 20.

Afterwards, complaining to the King that they were unjustly injured by the Synod, they petitioned him, sibi tribui licentiam ut ad Papam urbis Romae accedere debeant. Whereupon Rex annuens petitionibus eorum, datis E∣pistolis, eos abire permisit. When they came to Rome, and compined to Pope John of their misery and unjust removal, he writ to the King, desiring him to re∣store them; which he did. After which they falling into new crimes by bearing arms, murdering and oppressing their Citizens, reviling the King and his mother, drinking and whoring day and night, were again removed by the King from their Bishopricks,Anno 589. and thrust into the Monastery of Marcellus.Surius Concil.

Gunthramus Rex Francorum issued this memorable Pre∣cept, De observando die Dominico to the Bishops summoned by him to the second Council of Matiscon, & omnibus Pontificibus & universis Clericis, & cunctis Judicibus in regione nostra consitutis, beginning thus; Per hoc supernae Majestatis authorem (cujus universa reguntur Imperio) placari credimus, si in populo nostro justitiae jura, & praeceptorum divinorum monita servamus. Dum ergo pro Regni nostri stabilitate, & sal∣vatione Populi, solicitudine pervigili attentius pertractavimus, agnovimus in∣fra regni nostri spatia universa scelera, quae canonibus et legibus pro divino timore puniri consuerunt, suadente adversario boni ope∣ris, perpetrari (to the drawing down of Gods judgements on them;) which sinnes he thereupon enjoynes the Bishops and Ministers to endeavour to suppresse by their Preaching and Holy Lives;Mark . Nam nec nos, quibus facultatem regnandi superni Regis commisit authoritas iram eius evadere possumus, si de subiecto populo soli∣citudinem non habemus: Idcirco hujus Decreti ac definitionis generalis vigore decer∣nimus

And the Judges to punish them according to Law; Concluding, Cuncta ergo, quae hujus Edicti tenore decrevimus perpetu∣aliter volumus custodiri, quia in sancta Synoda Matisconensi, haec om∣nia sicut nostis, studuimus diffiniri, quae praesenti authoritate vulga∣mus, wherein were 20.

Non credimus vestram latere sancti∣tatem quanto tempore in errore Arrianorum, laborasset Hispania, & non multos post decessum genitoris nostri dies, quibus nos vestra beatitudo fidei sanctae Catholicae cognovit esse sociatos, credimus generaliter magnum et aeternum gaudium habuisse, et ideo Venerandi Patres ad hanc vos peragendum congregandos decrevimus Synodum, ut de omnibus nuper advenientibus ad Chri∣stum, ipsi aeternas Domino gratias deferatis.

Susceptus est autem ab omnibus Dei Sacerdotibus, offerente Rege, sacrosanctae fidei tomus, et pronunciante Nota∣rio clara voce recensitus est ita, &c. Here this King himself draws up a Con∣fession of his Faith, and commands it to be publickly read in the Synod; which was generally received by all the Bishops and Priests present in this Council, was read with a lowd voyce in this memorable form. Quamvis Deus omnipotens, pro utilitatibus populorum regni, nos culmen subire tribuerit, et mode∣ramen gentiumnon paucarum regiae nostrae curae commiserit, memi∣nimus tamen nos mortalium conditione perstringi, nec posse felici∣tatem futurae beatitudinis aliter promereri, nisi nos cultui verae fi∣dei deputemus, et conditori nostro, saltem confessione, qua dignus est ipse, placeamus. Pro qua re quanto subditorum gloria regali ex∣tollimur, tanto providi esse debemus (Let Baronius, Popes and Popish Pre∣lates observe it, who deny that Kings have ought to do in matters of Faith and Re∣ligion) in his quae ad Deum sunt, vel nostram spem augere, vel gentibus
nobis a Deo creditis consulere. Caeterum, quid pro tantis benefi∣ciorum collationibus omnipotentiae divinae valemus tribuere?Psal: 16. quando omnia ipsius sint, et bonorum nostroum nihil egeat, nisi ut in eum sic tota devotione credimus, quemadmodum per scripturas sacras se ipse intelligi voluit, et credi praecepit? id est, ut confiteamur esse Pa∣trem, qui genuerit ex substantia sua Filium sibi & coequalem et coaeternum: Non tamen ut idem ipse sit natus & genitor, sed persona alius sit Pater, qui genuit, alius sit Filius qui fuerit generatus, unius tamen uterque substantiae in divinitate subsistat. Pater, ex quo sit Filius, ipse vero ex nullo sit alio: Filius qui habeat Patrem, sed sine initio & sine diminutione, in ea, qua Patri coaequalis & coaeternus est divinitate subsistat. Spiritus sanctus confitendus a nobis est et praedicandus, a Patre & Filio procedere, & cum Patre & Filio unius esse substantiae. Tertiam vero in Trinitate Spiritus sancti esse personam, qui tamen communem habeat cum Patre & Filio divini∣tatis essentiam. Haec enim Sancta Trinitas, unus Deus est; Pater & Filius, & Spiri∣tus sanctus, cujus bonitate omnis licet bona sit condita creatura, per assumpam tamen à Filio humani habitus formam, a damnata progenie reformamur ad beatitudinem pristi∣nam. Sed sicut verae salutis indicium est Trinitatem in Unitate, & Ʋnitatem in Trini∣tate sentire, ita erit consummata justitia, si candem fidem intra Vni∣versalem Ecclesiam teneamus, et Apostolicam Vnitatem in Aposto∣lico positi fundamento, servemus. Tamen vos Dei Sacerdotes, meminisse oportet, quantis hucusqae Ecclesia Dei catholica per Hispanias adversae partis mo∣lestiis laboraverit, dum & Catholici constanter fidei suae tenerent ac defenderent veritatem, & Haeretici pertinaciori animositate propriae niterenturPerficiae. perfidi.

Erit enim mihi immarcessibilis corona, vel gaudium in retributione Iustorum, si hi populi, qui NOSTRA ad unitatem Ecclesiae SOLERTIA transcurrerunt, fun∣dati in eadem et stabiliti permaneant. Sicut enim DIVINO NU∣TU NOSTRAE CURAE FUIT HOS POPULOS AD UNITATEM CHRISTI ECCLESIAE PERTRAHERE, ita sit vestrae docibilitatis, ca∣tholicis eos dogmatibus instituere, quo in toto cognitione veritatis instructi, noverint ex so∣lido errores Haeresis perniciosae respuere, & verae fidei tramitem ex charitate retinere, vel Catholicae Ecclesiae communionem desiderio avidiori amplecti. Caeterum, sicut facile ad veniam pervenisse confido, quod nescia hucusque tam clarissima erraverit gens, ita gra∣vius esse non dubito, si agnitam veritatem dubio corde teneat, atque a patenti lumine (quod absit) oculos suos avertat.

Amplector itaque et teneo fidem Centum Quinquaginta Episcopo∣rum Constantinopoli congregatorum, quae Macedonium, Spiritus sancti sub∣stantiam minorantem, & à Patris & Filii unitate & essentia segregantem, jugulo veritatis interemit. Primae quoque Ephesinae Synodi fidem, quae adversus Nestorium ejusque doctrinam lata est, credo pariter et honoro. Si∣militer et Chalcedonensis Concilii fidem, quam plenam Sanctitate & Eru∣ditione adversus Euichen & Dioscorum protulit, cum omni Ecclesia catholica reverenter suspicio. Omnium quoque Orthodoxorum venerabilium Sacerdo∣tum Concilia, quae ab ipsis suprascriptis quatuor Synodis, fidei puritate non dissonant, pari veneratione observo. Properet ergo reverentia vestra, fidem hanc nostram canonicis applicare monimentis, & ab Episcopis, vel religiosis aut gentis nostraeNota. primoribus solenniter fidem, quam in Ecclesia catho∣lica crediderunt, audire. Quam renovatam apicibus, vel eorum sub∣scriptionibus roboratam, futuris olim temporibus in testimonium Dei, atque hominum reservatae, ut hae gentes, quas in Dei nomi∣ne, regia potestate praecellimus, & deterso antiquo errore per unctionem sacrosancti Chrismatis, vel manus impositionem paracletum intra Dei Ecclesiam perceperunt Spiritum, quem unum & aequalem cum Paire & Filio confitentes, ejusque Dono in sinu Ec∣clesiae sanctae Catholicae collatae sunt, si eorum aliqui hanc rectam & sanctam Confessionem nostram minime credere voluerint, iram Dei cum Anathemate aeterno percipiant, et de interitu suo fidelibus gaudium, infidelibus sint in exemplum. Huic vero confessioni meae, sanctas suprascriptorum Conciliorum constitutiones contexui, et testimonio divino tota cordis simplici∣tate subscripsi. Then follow the 3. Confessions of faith: viz. Confessio Nicenae Synodi, Credimus, &c. Symbolum CL. Patrum Constantinopolitani Concilii, Credi∣mus, &c. Tractatus Chalcedonensis Synodi. Next, this Kings and his Queens subscripti∣ons, to this his Confession of faith, which was publikely read, Ego Reccaredus Rex fidem hanc sanctam et veram Confessionem, quam una per totum orbem Catholica confitetur Ecclesia, corde retinens, ore af∣firmans, mea dextera Deo protegente subscripsi. Ego Badda glori∣osa Regina hanc fidem, quam credidi et suscepi, manu mea de toto corde subscripsi. Which being read, Tunc acclamatum est in laudibus Dei et in favore Principis ab universo Concilo: Gloria Deo Patri, & Filio, & Spiritui sancti, cui cura est pacem & unitatem Ecclesiae suae Sanctae Ca∣tholicae providere. Gloria Domino nostro Jesu Christo, qui precio sanguinis sui Ecclesiam Catholicam ex omnibus gentibus congregavit. Gloria Domino nostro Jesu Christo, qui tam illustrem gentem unitati fidei verae copulavit, et unum gre∣gem, & unum Pastorem instituit. Cui a Deo aeternum meritum, nisi vero Catholico Reccaredo Regis? Cui a Deo aeterna corona, nisi ve∣ro Orthodoxo Reccaredo Regi? Cui praesens Gloria et aeterna nisi
vero amatori Dei Reccaredo regi? Ipse novarum plebium in Ec∣clesia conquisitor. Ipse mereatur veraciter Apostolicum meritum, qui Apostolicum implevit officium (Mark these expressions of all those Bishops and Priests) Ipse sit Deo et hominibus amabilis qui tam mi∣rabiliter Deum glorificavit in terris, praestante Domino nostro Iesu Christo, qui cum Deo Patre vivit & rgnat in unitate Spiritus sancti in secula seculo∣rum. After this the Bishops, Priests, Nobles assembled in this Council having thus approv'd, applauded this Kings Confession of his faith, drew up another of their own concur∣ring in form and substance with the Kings, which not only the Bishops & Priests, but likewise, Concil: Tom: 2. p. 671, 672. Similiter omnes Seniores othorum (then present) et permulti Pro∣cerum et Illustrium virorum subscripserunt: Having Votes and Subscriptions too in this famous Council, as well as the Bishops and Priests, even in matters of faith: Which their rightGratian Dist. 96. Ubiam. See Onuphrius, Luitprandus, & Lydius in Nicholao 1. Pope Nicholas the 1. in his Epistle to Michael the Emperor (about the year 870.) in the case of Ignatius Patriarch of Constantinople, acknowledg∣eth in these words. Ʋbinam legistis, Imperatores antecessores vestors Synodalibus Con∣ventionibus interfuisse? etsi forte in quibusdam, tibi de fide tractatum est: quae et omnium communis est; quae non solum ad Clericos, verum etiam ad Laicos, et ad omnes omnino pertinet Christianos. And the Glosse thus seconds. Quod omnes tangit ab omnibus debet approbari; as here it was.Surius, p. 672. 673. Post Confessionem ergo & subcriptionem omnium Episcoporum, et totius gentis Gothicae Seniorum, Gloriosissimus Dominus no∣ster Reccaredus Rex, pro reparandis simul et confirmandis disciplinae Ecclesiasticae moribus, Dei Sacerdotes taliter affatus est, dicens. Regia cura usque in eum modum protendi debet et dirigi, quam ple∣nam constiterit aetatis et scientiae capere rationem. Nam sicut in rebus humanis eminet potestas regia, ita et prospiciendae commoditati compro∣vincialium major debet esse et providentia. At nunc, beatissimi Sacerdotes, non in eis tantummodo rebus diffundimus solertiam nostram, quibus populi sub nostro regimine positi pacatissime gu∣bernentur et vivant, sed etiam in adjutorio Christi, extendimus nos ad ea, quae sunt coelestia, cogitare, et quae populos fideles efficiant satagimus non nescire. This being the principal part of his Regal office and care.) Caeterum si totis nitendum est viribus, humanis moribus modum ponere, & insolen∣tium rabiem regia potestate refrenare, si quieti & paci propagandae opem debemus impendere; multo magis est adhibenda solicitudo, (mark it) desiderare, et co∣gitare divina, inhiare ad sublimia, et ab errore retractis populis ve∣ritatem eis se renae lucis ostendere. Sic enim agit qui multiplici bo∣no se a Deo remunerari confidit. Sic enim agit qui super id, quod ei com∣mittitur, Luc. 10. auget, dum illi dicitur, Quicquid supererogaveris, ego cum rediero reddam tibi. Ergo quia jam fidei nostrae & confessionis formam plena serie vestra beati∣tudo recensuit, simul{que} et Sacerdotum nostrorumq, Procerum fides atque confessio san∣ctitati vestrae perpatuit, hoc adhuc necessario pro firmitate Catholicae fidei no∣stra Deo supplex instituere decrevit authoritas, ut propter roborandum gentis nostrae no∣vellam conversionem, omnes Hispaniarum & Galiciae Ecclesiae hanc regulam servent, ut omni sacrificii tempore ante communicationem corporis Christi et sanguinis, iuxta Orien∣talium partium morem, unanimiter clara voce sacratissimum fidei recenseant Symbolum, ut primum populi, quam credulitatem teneant fateantur, & sic corde fide purificata ad Christi corporis & sanguinem percipiendum exhibeant, &c. De caetro autem prohi∣bendis insolentium moribus mea vobis consentientecl mentia, sententiis terminate districtio∣ribus, & firmiore disciplina quae facienda non sunt, prohibete, et ea quae fieri debent immobili constitutione firmate. Whereupon they drew up 23. Canons to this purpose according to this Kings direction; who ratified them by this ensuing Royal Decree, wherein the heads of them are all recited. Surius, Tom, 2. p. 676. Edictum Regis de Confirmatione Concilii. Gloriosisimus Dominus Rec∣caredus Rex, universis sub Regimine nostrae potestatis existentibus. Amatores nos sui
divini favoris veritas, nostris principaliter sensibus inspiravit, ut causa instaurandae fidei ac disciplinae Ecclesiasticae, Episcopos omnes Hispaniae no∣stro praesentari culmini juberemus. Pracedente autem diligenti et tanta deliberatione, sive quae ad fidem conveniunt, seu quae ad morum correctionem respiciant, sensus maturitate, & intelligentiae gravitate constant esse digesta. Nostra proinde authoritas id om∣nibus, ad regnum nostrum pertinentibus jubet, ut quae definita sunt in hoc sancto Concilio nulli contemnere liceat, nullus praeterire prae∣sumat. Capitula enim quae nostris sensibus placita et disciplinae con∣grua, a praesenti conscripta sunt Synodo, in omni authoritate, sive Clericorum, sive quorumcunque omnium, observentur et maneant. Then reciting their heads, he concludes, Has omnes constitutiones Ec∣clesiasticas quas summatim breviterque perstrinximus, sicut plenius in Canones continentur, manere perenni stabilitate sancimus. Si quis ergo Clericus aut Laicus harum sanctionum obediens esse no∣suerit, si Episcopus, Presbyter, Diaconus aut Clericus fuerit, ab omni Concilio excommunicationi subjaceat. Si vero Laicus fuerit, & honestioris loci persona est, medietatem facultatum suorum amittat fisci juribus profutu∣ram; si vero minoris loci persona est, amissione rerum suarum mulctatus, in exilium de∣putetur. Flavius Reccaredus Rex, hanc deliberationem, quam cum sancta diffini∣mus Synodo, confirmans subscripsi. It is very observable that this KingSurius, Tom. 2. p. 671. Reccaredus by his power, piety, and example converted all the Bishops, Clergy, Nobles and others of the whole Gothish Nation, from the Arrian Heresie which they anathematized, to the Orthodox faith, as they all thus acknowledged in this Council. Tunc Episcopi omnes una cum Clericis suis, Primoresque gentis Gothicae, pari consensione dixerunt, Licet hoc jam olim conversionis nostrae tempore egerimus, quando secuti gloriosissimum Dominum nostrum Reccaredum Regem ad Ecclesiam transivimus, et perfidiam Arria∣nam, cum omnibus superstitionibus suis anathematizavimus, pa∣riterque abjecimus: After which protesting their unanimous, cordial believing, embracing, profession of the Kings Orthodox faith, they denounced many Anathemaes against the Arrian heresy, and each branch thereof; sub∣joyning this ingenuous confession of their Conversion from their heresie, by this Kings means, and their cordial embracing of his faith. Comfitemur, nos ex haeresi Arriana toto corde, tota anima, & tota mente nostra ad Ecclesiam catholicam fuisse conversos. Nulli dubium sit, nos, nostrosque decessores errasse in haeresi Arriana, & fidem Evangelicam, atque Apostolicam nunc intra Eccle∣siam Catholicam didicisse. Proinde fidem sanctam quam religiosissi∣mus Dominus noster patefecit in medio Concilii, et manu sua sub∣scripsit, hanc et nos tenemus, hanc confitemur pariter et suscipimus, hanc in populis praequicare, atque docere promittimus. Haec est vera fides, quam omnis Ecclesia, dum per totum mundum tenet, Catholica esse creditur, & pro∣batur, 1 Cor. 16. Cui haec fides non placet, aut non placuerit, sit Anathema Maranatha in adventu Domini nostri Jesu Christi, &c. All of them unanimously embracing; subscribing, professing perpetually to adhere to that Confession of the Catholick faith, which this their religious King (who converted them) had made and read unto them in this Sy∣nod; anathematizing all such who disliked, or assented not thereunto. I have transcribed these Speeches, passages, Confession, and Charter of Confirmation of this pious King and Synod even in Spain it self (where the Pope now most predo∣minates) because they justifie the Emperor Justinians Ecclesiastical Authority, Laws, Proceedings, (so much decryed byHere, p. 133, &c. Baronius) demonstrate the care and duty of the an∣tientest Christian Kings in Spain and elsewhere to promote the orthodox faith, true worship, service of God, conversion, salvation of their Subjects souls as the principal means of their temporal and eternal felicity: and utterly subvert the antichristian asser∣tions of Popes, Popish Canonists, Prelats, Priests;Gratian, dist: 96. & Glossa. Quaecunque a Principibus terrae in or∣dinibus, vel in Ecclesiasticis rebus decreta inveniuntur, authoritatis nullius esse mon∣strantur, cum Laici de rebus Ecclesiasticis nihil possunt constituere;Hardings an∣swer to Bishop Jewels Apolo∣gy: See his de∣fence of it, p. 749. That this matter
is so clear, that no secular Prince from the beginning of the world till this day, can be na∣med, who by the ordinary power of a Prince (without the gift of Prophecy or special Reve∣lation) did laudably meddle with Religion, as a Judge, or ruler of spiritual causes, &c. And refutes the received answer of Civilians and Canonists on Justinians most ex∣cellent Law concerning Bishops and Priests, to this Question,Autenticorum Collatio, l 1. Tit: 6. Gloss. Sancimus, f. 1. Ad quid se intro∣mittat Imperator de Spiritualibus vel Ecclesiasticis, cum sciat ad se non pertinere? To which if any answer be given, it must be principally this: Dic, quod authoritate Papae hoc facit; by whose Authority neither any pious Emperors, nor this Spanish King ever held, summoned Councils, or made, confirmed the recited orthodox Confessions of faith, nor their Ecclesiastical Laws or Constitutions, but by their own Regal Supre∣macies. Epist. l. 4. Epist. 34, 82. Pope Gregory the 1. sirnamed the Great,Anno 5 most frequently prayes to God for the Emperor Mauritius, and stiles him his Lord, and most excellent Lord: adding, Deus vos universo mundo praeesse constituit.Epist: l. 2. Epist: 62 l. 3. Epist: 61 Potestas Do∣minorum meorum caelitus data est super omnes homines; himself subjecting his Papal Miter to his Imperial commands, not out of meer humility, but bounden duty and conscience; as his Ego sum servus vester, O Imperator, ego vestrae jussioni subjectus; ego quod debui erolvi, qui Imperatori obedientiam praebui, attest. He begins one of his Epistles to him thus,Epist: l. 5, Epist 63. Inter animarum curas, et innumerabiles solicitudines quas indefesso studio pro Christianae reipublicae regimine sustinetis, magna mihi, et universo mundo saetitiae causa est, quod pietas vestra Custodiae fidei, qua Dominorum fulget Imperium, praecipua soli∣citudine semper invigilat. Vnde omnino confido, servat vos De∣us, causa Religiosae mentis amore tuemini; ita Deus vestras Maje∣states sua gratia tuetur et adjuvat. Another Epistle begins thus,Epist. l. 6. Epist: 6. Om∣nipotens Deus, qui pietatem vestram pacis Ecclesiasticae fecit esse custodem, ipse vos fide servat, &c. Pro qua re totis precibus depreca∣mur ut bonum hoc Omnipotens Deus Serenitati Dominorum, piae{que} eorum soboli, et in praesenti seculo, atque in perpetua remuneratione retribueret. And he concludes another Epistle to him thus,Epist. l. 6. Ep 31. & 6. Epist. 2. Omnipo∣tens autem Deus serenissimi Domini nostri vitam, et ad pacem sanctae Ecclesiae, et ad utilitatem Reipublicae Romanae (both coup∣led together by him, as his office, duty in and towards both alike) per tem∣pora longa custodiat. In another Epistle,Epist: l. 1, Epist: 6. Leontiae Augustae, he thus prayes to Almighty God; ut cor vestrae pietatis sua semper dextra te∣neat, ejusque cogitationes caelestis gratiae ope dispenset, Ouate∣nus tranquillitas vestra rectius valeat sibi servientes regere, quan∣to Dominatori omnium noverit minus deservire. In amore catho∣licae fidei faciat Defensores suos, quas fecit ex benigno opere Impe∣ratores nostros. Infundat vestris mentibus zelum simul & mansuetudinem, ut semper pro fervore valearis, et quicquid in Deo exceditur, non inul∣tum relinquete, et si quid vobis delinquitur, parcendo tolerare, &c. Yea he thus declaims against and censures that Title of Universal Bishop, and Head of the Ʋniversal Church, which his successors so much contend for, as Antichristian,Epist. l. 4.  34 l. 5. Ep. 3 Ego fidenter dico, quod quisquis se Vniversalem Sacerdotem vocat, vel vocari desiderat, in elatione sua Antichri∣stum praecurrit, quia superbiendo se caeteris praeponit. Yea he tells Mauritius the Emperor, that this Title is, contra statuta Evangelica, contra Canonum Decreta; That Nullus unquam praedecessorum suorum hoc tam prophano vocabulo uti consenserit. Quia si unus Patriarcha universalis dicetur, Patriarcharum nomen caeteris de∣rogetur. Epist: l. 4. Epistt 3 36, 38. l. 7. Ep. 3 & 39. & l. 6. Ep. 2. & 28. Si unus Episcopus vocatur Vniversalis, tota Ecclesia corruit. What would he have said of his successors think you, who not only chal∣lenge
this Title de Jure, but the Titles ofHere, p. 25, 0. to 52, 60, 2, 69. Rex Regum, & Dominus Dominorum, Deus, & Vice-Deus too? Sntentiarum, . 3. c 51. Isiodorus Episcopus Hispalensis,Anno 6 thus resolves; Sub religionis disciplina seculi Potestates subjecti sunt: & quamvis culmine regio sint praediti, vinculo tamen fidei tenentur astricti, ut et fidem Christi suis legibus praedicent, et ipsam fidei prae∣dicationem moribus bonis conservent. Principes seculi nonnun∣quam intra Ecclesiam potestatis adeptae culmina tenent, ut per e∣andem potestatem disciplinam Ecclesiasticam muniant. Caeterum in∣tra Ecclesiam potestates necessariae non essent, nisi, ut quod non praevalet Sacerdos efficere per doctrinae Sermonem, potestas hoc imperet per disciplinae terro∣rem. Sane per regnum terrenum coeleste regnum proficit, ut qui intra Ecclesiam positi contra fidem et disciplinam agunt, rigore Principum conterantur, ipsamque disciplinam quam Ecclesiae hu∣militas exercere non praevalet, cervicibus superborum potestas Principum imponat, et ut venerationem mereatur, virtute potesta∣tis impertiat. Cognoscant Principes seculi Deo et debere se ra∣tionem reddere propter Ecclesiam quam a Christo tuendam recipi∣unt. Nam sive augeatur par et disciplina Ecclesiae per fideles Prin∣cipes, sive solvatur, ille ab eis rationem exiget, qui eorum pote∣stati suam Ecclesiam credidit. What more punctual to our Proposition (That Princes have the chief care of the Church, and their peoples souls, for which they must give an account to God:) then this his resolution?Sententiarum l. 3. c. 48, 49, 50, 52. He hath much more to the same effect, which I pretermit. The Bishops and Priests convened in the 4. Council of Toledo (whereof this Isiodor Hispalensis was one) religiosissimi Sisenandi Regis Hispaniae atque Galliciae,Anno 633 imperiis atque jussis,Surius Concil. Tom: 2. p. 727, 728. Centur. Magd: 7. c. 9. ut communis agitaretur de quibusdam Ecclesiae disciplinis tractatus; thus ex∣presse themselves in the Prologue to the Canons therein made; Primum gra∣tias Salvatori nostro Deo omnipotenti egimus, post haec antefato ministro ejus excellen∣tissimo & glorioso Regi, cuius tanta devotio extat, ut non solum in rebus huma∣nis, SED ETIAM IN CAUSIS DIVINIS SOLICI∣TUS MANEAT: Who when this Council was set, pro merito fidei suae, cum Magnificentissimis & Nobilissimis Viris ingressus, religiosa prosecutione Synodum exhortatus est, ut paternorum decretorum memores, ad confirmanda in nobis jura Ecclesiasti∣ca studium praeberemus, & illa corigere, quae dum per negligentiam in usum venerunt, contra Ecclesiasticos mores licntiam sibi de usurpatione fecerunt. Talibus ergo ejus monitis gauden∣tes, necessarium extitit iuxta eius nostrumque votum, contractare quae compe∣tunt, sive in Sacramentis divinis, quae diverso atque illicito modo in Hispaniarum Ecclesiis celebrantur, seu in moribus pravè usurpata noscuntur. In this Council not only Bishops, Priests, Deans, but the Nobility of Spain, cap. 3. Suri∣us, p. 728. et Laici qui electioni Conci∣lii inesse meruerunt, were present. After all their Canons for confirmation of the Christian faith, reformation of manners in the Clergy and Laity, and repressing the exorbitances of Hereticks and Jewes, Can. 74. they adde a Canon pro robore nostrorum Regum, & stabilitate gentis Gothorum, denouncing a solemn excommuni∣cation against all persons who contrary to their Oath of Allegiance and duty should attempt any Treason against the Kings person, life, or usurp the Crown, &c. And then conclude the Acts of this Council with this Prayer.Ibid. p. 738. Pax & salus & diuturnitas piissimo & amatori Christi Domino nostro Sisenando Regi, cujus devotio nos ad hoc salu∣tiferum decretum convocavit: Corroboret ergo Christi gratia regnum illius, gentisque Gothorum in fide Catholicae annis & meritis; protegat illum usque ad ultimam senec∣tutem summi Dei gratia, & post praesentis Regni gloriam ad aeternum regnum transeat, ut sine fine regnet, qui in seculo feliciter imperat, ipso praestante qui est Rex Regum, & Do∣minus Dominorum, cum Patre & Spiritu sancto in secula seculorum. Amen. Definitis itaque his, quae superius comprehensa sunt, annuente religiosissimo Principe, placuit, de∣inceps nulla re impediente, à quolibet nostrum, ea quae constituta sunt temerari, sed cuncta salubri consilio conservari. The 5. Council of Toledo hath this Prologue;Anno 636 Gratiarum actiones Deo omnipotenti persolvimus,Surius Concil: Tom. 2. p. 539, 740. Centur. Magd. 7. c. 9. &c. propter gloriosa Principis nostri Chintillani Regis intia, ob cuius sa∣lutis & felicitatis constantiam supernam imploramus Clementiam; qui in medio nostri

Can. 7. decrees, Ut in omni Concilio Episcoporum Hispaniae, universalis Concilii Decretum (to wit, Toletan. 4. Can. 74.) quod propter Principum nostrorum est salutem constitutum, peractis omnibus in Synodo publica voce debat pronunciari, quatenus saepè replicatum au∣ribus, vel assidnitate iniquorum mens territa corrigatur, quae ad praevaricandum & obli∣vione & facilitate perducitur. Can. 8. they grant the King power to dispense offen∣ces against the Canons of this Council. In his omnibus quae praemisimus potestatem indulgentiae in culpis delinquentium Principi reservamus, ut jurta bonitatis suae ac pietatis moderamen, ubi emendationem presfexerit mentium, veniam tribuat culparum. After their thanks to God, they conclude; Post haec gratias excellentissimo gloriosissimo Principi nostro Chintillano regi peragimus, cujus ardor fidei et bonae intentionis, et unitatis concordiam nobis tribuit, et fiduciam charitatis. Donet ei Dominus & de inimicis triumphum, & de beatitudine gaudium, custodiat cum protectione assidua, muniat bonae voluntatis suae circumsectione iutissima, cujus regnum manet in secula seculorum. The 6. Council of Toledo summoned by this King Suintilla,Anno 638 (who was present in it with his Nobles) Can. 2, 3. recites,Surius Concil: Tom: 2. p. 742, 744, 745. That inspiramine summi Dei excellentissimus & Christianissimus Princep Chintillanus, ardore Fidei inflammatus, cum regni sui Sacerdotibus, praevaricationes & superstitiones Judaeorum eradicare elegit funditus; nec sinit degere in regno suo eum, qui non sit Catholicus: ob cu∣jus fervorem fidei gratias Domino omnipotenti coelorum agimus; eo quod ei tam illustrem creavit animam, et sua replevit sapientia; Ipse quoque donet ei & praesentis aevi diuturnam vitam, et in futuro gloriam aeternam; Quocirca consonam cum eo corde et ore promulgamus Deo placi∣turam sententiam, simul etiam cum suorum Optimatum illustrium{que} virorum consensu et deliberatione sancimus, ut quisquis succeden∣dentium temporum regni sortitus fuerit apicem, non ante conscenda regiam sedem quam inter reliqua conditionum sacramenta, polli∣citus fuerit, hanc se Catholicam non permissurum eos violare fidem. Can. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. they provide for the safety, succession of this King and his po∣sterity, against all Trasons, Usurpations, Conspiracies and pretenders: Nefas est enim in dubium deducere ejus potestatem, cui omnium gubernatio superno constat delegata judicio. Concluding the Acts of this Synod thus. Gratias agimus Christianissimo & gloriosissimo Chintillano Principi nostro, cujus studio advocati & instan∣tia collecti sumus; cujus voluntas probata, ordinatio extitit religiosa: Donet ei Domi∣nus optimo Principi diuturnum in seculum triumphum, & in parte justorum perpetuum regnum, felicibusque annis felix ipse in longa felicitate fruatur, & divinae dexterae pro∣tectione ubique muniatur. Platina, Albo Floriacensis, Anastatius, & Balaeus in Vita Severini, Blondus in De∣cad. 1. l. 9. p. 124 Centur. Magd. 7. c. 7. col. 235. c. 10. col. 493. Seveinus being elected Pope by the Clergy and people of Rome,Anno 638 Isacius Italiae Exarchus Roman veniens, eum in Pontificatu confirmavit: tunc enim tempo∣ris Cleri et populi electio nihil valebat, nisi confirmatio Imperatoris aut eius Exarchi accederet. A strong evidence of the Emperors Supream Jurisdiction o∣ver Popes, not of Popes over them. Honorius his predecessor having heaped up a great masse of monies in Episcopio Lateranensi; Isacius intreated Severinus, ut aliquid in militares sumptus conferret; who denying it, thereupon others stirred up the Ro∣man Army against him; saying, Quid prodest, quod tantae pecuniae congregatae sunt in Episcopio Lateranensi, ab Honorio Papa, & Miles iste nihil subventus habet? Whereupon all the Soldiers, from the youngest to the eldest, besieged and assault∣ed the Popes Pallace, sealed up the Treasury till Isacius came from Ravenna to Rome; qui misit omnes Primates Ecclesiae singulos per singulas Civitates in exilium, ut non fuisset qui ei resistere debuisset de Clero; and then entring the Popes Pallace con∣tinued there 8. dayes, untill he had seised on and removed all the Treasure, part whereof he sent to the royal City of Constantinople to Heraclius the Emperor. So little Soveraign Authority had Popes in that age over the Emperor, or his Officers; who patiently submitted to this plunder, without thundring out any excommu∣nication against the Soldiers, Officers, or Emperor.
To passe by the 1. and 2. Councils ofSurius Concil: Tom. 2. p. 746, 749, 759, 760, 762, Bracara,Anno 646 summoned ex regali praecepto gloriosissimi atque piissimi Ariamiri Regis, (about the years 640, and 642.) adspi∣rante sibi Domino, as their Proemes recite. The 7th. Council of Toledo (summoned Studio & jussu amatoris Christi Chindasiundi Regis nostri) cap. 1. provides against Perfidious Clerks and Laymen, who in forraign parts plotted Treason against the King and Kingdom, in necem regis seu eversionem; that they should be excommunicated, for∣feit all their estates, and made uncapable to enjoy them, unlesse the King should please to allow them some part thereof upon their submission: and after 5. other Canons of Ecclesiastical affairs, No autem universali Deo, & glorioso Chindasiundo Principi, ob cujus votum in hanc urbem sancta devotione convenimus, gratias unanimi∣ter offerentes, optabili annisu deposcimus, ut sanctae Ecclesiae catholicae fidei semper ac pacis cumuletur effectus, & memorato Principi cum prosperitate praesentis regni futuri etiam lar∣giantur praemia gaudii, &c. There falling out some differences between Paulus Patriarch of Constantinople,Anno 650 (a proud imperious Prelate) and Pope Martin;Anastatius, Luitprandus, Albo Floria∣censis, Platina Barns, Balaeus, in vita Martini, Baronius, Anno 650.

Council of Toledo) and what things else he desired to be done and voted in, by this Council; he exhorted them; ut quaecun{que} illic tenentur asscripta, valido attendatis intuitu, sagaci perscrutamini studio, et quaecun{que} extiterint placita Deo, vestri oris ad nos sacro referantur oraculo. The Council, Accepto deinde oblato nobis Tomo, agente Domino gratias, acclamavimus Gloria in excel∣sis Deo, &c. Post eidem sacro Principi benediximus, reseratoque Tomo, haec inibi contexta reperimus; which were read. It begins with the confession of his faith, which he recommended to the Council, wherein there is this memorable Passage: Primo ita{que} coram se reverentia vestra habeat; quod nosse non ambigit, me orthodoxae fidei veram, sanctam et synceram regulam, de corde puro et conscientia bona plenissime habe∣re, sicut eam sancta at{que} Apostolica traditio doceat, si cut eam sancta Sy∣nodus Niceae constituit, sicut Constantinopoli sanctorum Patrum con∣gregatio definivit; sicut Ephesini primi coetus unitas affirmavit; sicut Chalcedonensi Concilii definitio protulit. Hanc cum fidelibus servans, ad hanc salvandos infideles invitans, in hanc subjectos populos re∣gens, hanc propriis gentibus tenendam insinuans, hanc populis alienis annuncians; ut in illa glorificans Deum, et inter morta∣les nos summae divinitatis felicitas assequatur, et in terra viventi∣um haereditas a me gloriae capiatur. Then relating what good workes he desired to do, and to be done by himself and others, to adorn, advance this faith, that it might not prove a dead faith; he concludes and subscribes it, thus. Item subscriptio. In nomine Domini Flavius Recessuinthus Rex hanc fidei & bonae voluntatis meae deliberationem manu mea subscripsi. This whole Council relecta Tomi pagina, cum glorificassemus Deum de fidei principalis auditu, et de bonae voluntatis ejus effectu; drew up a uniform profession of their faith, and other Canons answerable to the Kings: Which
being subscribed by the Bishops, Abbots, & viri illustres officii Palatini, (even 18. Earls and Dukes, besides others) were ratified by the King. This Council by a Decree in the name of the King; made a Law concerning the Lands and goods purchased by their Kings, which of them should go with the Crown, and which they might dispose of to their Sons: These Councils being all properly Parliaments, wherein the King and Nobles sate, voted, subscribed, as well as Bishops and Priests, and made Civil Laws for the King & kingdom, as well as Ecclesiastical for the orthodox Faith and Church. The 9. Council of Toledo,Anno 665 Anno 655. with the 10th. 566. and the Council of Emeritan,Surius Concil▪ Tom: 2. p. 86 869, 870. Anno 666. were all summoned by this King Recessuinthus his command; who prescribed what they should decree, ratified their Canons, enjoyed their spe∣cial praises and prayers to God, Obsecrantes ejus misericordiam largam, ut serenissimo nostro & amabili Christo Recessuintho Principi glorioso, ita praesentis vitae felicitatem impendat, ut Angelicae beatitudinis gloriam post longaeva tempora concederet; Enacting, that every one who attempted any thing contra salutem Principum, gentis{que} aut patriam, violated his Oaths of allegiance to them, mox propria dignitate privatus, & loco & honore habeatur exclusus; reserving only a power and liberty to the King to restore him to his place or honor, or both, if he saw cause. And the 1.Surius Concil: Tom. 2. p. 874. Council of Cabellon in France (summoned about the same year (656) ex evocatione & ordinatione gloriosi Do∣mini Clodovei Regis, pro zelo religionis, vel orthodoxae Fidei dilectione, & to reform what was amisse or wanting in the Church) made the like prayers for him. TheSurius Concil: Tom: 2. p. 372. Bochellus De∣creta Eccles: Gall. l. 5. Tit: 20. c. 17. p. 901. Bishops assembled in Aurelianensi Concilio 1. summoned by K. Clodoveus the 1. An. 500. when they had concluded and drawn up 33. Canons upon particular heads,Anno 500. recommended to them by this King, sent and submitted them to his Majesty with this preface. Domino suo Catholicae Ecclesiae filio Clodoveo Gloriosiss. Regi, omnes Sacerdotes quos ad Concilium venire jussistis. Quia tanta ad Religionis Catholicae cultum glo∣riosae fidei cura vos excitat, ut Sacerdotalis mentis affectu Sacerdotes de rebus neces∣sariis tractaturos in unum colligi jusseritis, secundum vestrae voluntatis consultationem et titulos quos dedistis, ea quae nobis visa sunt defini∣tione respondimus, ita ut si ea, quae nos statuimus, etiam vestro recta esse judicio comprobantur, tanti consensus Regis ac Domini Ma∣jori authoritate servanda, tantorum firmet sententia sacerdotum. Their Canons being all subjected to his will, to alter, reject or ratify them accor∣ding to his royal pleasure, without whose authority they were invalid. The 11. Council of Toledo was convened,Anno 675 Excellentissimo & religiosissimi Vuam∣bani principis praecepto;Surius, Tom. 2. p. 880, 887. Cujus providae solicitudinis voto, et lur Conciliorum renovata resplenduit, & alterna charitas se mutuo in corrigendis, et instruendis mori∣bus, excitavit; dum & aggregandi nobis hortatu Principis gloriosi facultas data est, et opportuna corrigendis praeparata est disciplina. They cloze up their Ca∣nons and Synod with their thanks, and this prayer for him: Post haec religioso Domi∣no & amabili Principi nostro Vuambano, Regi, gratiarum actiones persolvimus, cujus etiam studio aggregati sumus. Qui Ecclesiasticae disciplinae nostris seculis novus reparator occurrens, omissos Conciliorum ordines non solum restaurare inten∣dit, sed etiam annuis recursibus celebrandos instituit, ut ad alter∣nam morum correctionem annuo tempore alacriter concurrentes; juxta Prophetae vaticinium, quod in nobis defractum est, alligetur, & quod abjectum est, reducatur. Det ergo eidem Principi Dominus pro hujus sacrae sollicitudinis voto, & cur∣sum praesentis vitae in pace transire; et post diuturna tempora ad se in pace remissis iniquita∣tibus pervenire, qualiter & felicia tempora ducat, & felix cum omnibus quibus princi∣patur ad Christum sine confusione perveniat; ut quia per eum corona nostri ordinis in melius restauratur, coronam futuri regni capiat, ex hoc in regione vivorum regnans cum Christo in secula seculorum, Amen. The 3. Council of Bracara,Anno ibid. summoned the same year by this King Vuambanus, con∣cludes with these thanks to God,Surius, Tom. 2. p. 891. him, & prayer for him; Gratias ita{que} Omnipotenti Deo peragimus; posthaec sit pax, salus & diuturnitas piissimo, & amatori Christi Domino nostro Vuambano Regi, cujus devotio nos ad hoc decretum salutiferum convocavit; divinam postu∣lantes clementiam, ut gloria Christi regnum ejus corroboret usque ad ultimam senectutem, praestante ipso qui cum Patre & Spiritu sancto vivit, & gloriatur in Trinitate Deus in secula seculorum, Amen.
It is evident by Fredericus Lindebrogus his Codex Legum Antiquarum, Legis Wisi∣gothorum, lib. 1, 2. & Lex Burgundiorum, Lex Bohemorum, & Lex Longobardo∣rum; that these Councils of Toledo forecited, and those under Chilperick and other Kings of France and Italy, were in nature of parliaments; wherein these Kings made and promulged Ecclesiastical Lawes, intermixed with their Temporal, by the advice and assistance Principum, Ducum, Optimatum & Primatum consulente multitu∣dine; as well as of their Bishops and Clergy, who only did what they prescribed and directed them.Anno 676 The 6. General Council of Constantinople was convened by the religious Empe∣ror Flavius Constantinus Pogonatus,Surius Concil. Tom: 2. p. 899, to 906. Cent. Magd. 7. . 9. who summoned Donus then Bishop of Rome to come to this Council, as well as George Archbishop of Constantinople, whom he stiles in his summons, or Divalis sacra, universalis Patriarcha, as well as Donus Archbishop of old Rome, & Ʋniversalis Papa: Which summons, by reason of Donus his death before the Council, was delivered to his Successor Pope Agatho, who sent two Delegates in obedience to the Emperors command, to this Council; wherein the Emperor him∣self sate President, with many of his Great Officers and Nobles, as the Acts of this Council record. The 1. Action or Session begins thus.Surius, p. 902. In nomine Domini Dei & Salvatoris Jesu Christi, imperantibus a Deo cosonatis et Serenissimis nostris Dominis Flaviis, Constantino quidem piissimo, et a Deo de∣creto Magno Principe, perpetuo Augusto et Imperatore anno 27. et post consulatum ejus a Deo institutae mansuetudinis anno 13. die 7. mensis Novembris indictione nona, PRAESIDENTE IIDEM PI∣ISSIMO & CHRISTO DILECTO MAGNO IMPERATORE CONSTANTINO, in secretario sacri Palatii, quod cognominatur Trullus; et ex jussione ejus a Deo instructae serenitatis, praesentibus et audi∣entibus Niceta glorioso exconsule Patricio, & magistro Imperialium officiorum, Theo∣doro glorioso exconsule Patricio, & Comite Imperialis obsequii, & Substratega Thra∣ciae, Sergio glorioso exconsule Patrici, Paulo glorioso exconsule Patricio, Juliano glo∣rioso exconsule Patricio, & militari logotheta, Constantino glorioso exconsule Patricio, & Curatore Imperialis domus Hormisdae, Anastasio glorioso exconsule Patricio, & lo∣cum agente Imperialis comitis excubiti, Joanne glorioso exconsule Patricio, & disposi∣tore Orientalium provinciarum, Petro glorioso exconsule, Leontio glorioso exconsule & domestico imperialis mensae; (all named, placed before the Popes Delegates, the Pa∣triarch of Constantinople, and all other Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, through∣out all the Acts of this Council.) The Council being sate, Theodorus and Georgius Presbyters, and John the Deacon, representing Pope Agatho his person and his whole Synod at Rome, as their Proctors, spake thus to the Emperor; Benignissime Domine, secundum directam sacram a Deo instructa vestra fortitudi∣ne ad sanct:Surius Con∣cil: Tom. 2. p. 902, 904, 908, 928, 930, 944, 945, 947, 966, 967, 980, to 988, 990, to 994, 998, to 1013. 1016, to 1030. Papam, demandati sumus ad piissima vestigia a Deo confir∣matae vestrae Serenitatis, una cum ejus suggestione, necnon et cum altera ejus Synodica suggestione adaeque facta, &c. quas et obtulimus a Deo coronatae fortitudini vestrae, &c. After which Constantinus piissimus Imperator, dixit, (several times repeated) directing as President what should be done and read, throughout the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. and all other Actions and Sessions; which as they begin in like form as the first, Presi∣dente Piissimo Imperatore, &c; So this Emperor ordered all the pro∣ceedings in them, as Supreme Judge and Moderator, throughout the Coun∣cil, and Paulus magnificus à Senatis, & Imperialis Secretarius, registred all the proceedings, minding them every Sessions what they had done, where they left off, and how they should proceed, as Piissimus Imperator dixit, Suffici∣unt quae & hodierna die relecta sunt, reliqua verò in sequenti Secretario relegan∣tur. Monuit vestra pietas & haec Sancta Synodus; Sufficiunt quae hodierno die acta sunt, Gloriosissimi Judices dixerunt, &c. Constantinus Imperator dixit, E∣dicat Sanctum & Ʋniversale Concilium; si cum consensu omnium Episcoporum promulgata est, definita, &c. evidence. In theSurius Tom. 2. p. 908, to 928. 4th Action, Pope Aga∣thoes
Delegates humbly moved the Emperor, that his and the Synod of Romes Suggestions made and delivered by them to the Emperor might be read, si placet. Constantinus piissimus Imperator dixit, Relegantor. Whereupon they were produced and publickly read; wherein the Pope and his Council of Bishops held at Rome, thus humbly acknowledge the Emperor to be their Soveraign Lord, and they to be subject to his power and commands in matters divine and Ecclesiastical, as well as Temporal: Dominis piissimis & Serenis∣simis Victoribus ac Triumphatoribus, amatoribus Dei & Domini nostri Jesus Christi Con∣stantino Majori Imperatori, Heraclio & Tiberio Augusto, Agatho Episcopus, Ser∣vus servorum Dei, Magnam atque mirabilem, non indesinenti gratiarum actione Serenis∣simi Domini consiteor consolationis oportunitatem exhibere dignatus est, piissimum tranquillae mansuetudinis vestrae propositum, quem ad stabilitatem divinitus commissae reipublicae Christianae, ejus concessit dignatio, ut Imperialis virtus atque Clementia a Deo,Prov. 8 per quam Reges regnant, qui Rex Regum, & Dominus Dominantium est;1 Tim. 6 & curet et quaerat ejus immaculatae fidei veritatem, ut ab Apo∣stolis atque ab Apostolicis patribus est tradita, inquirere vigilanter, &c. After which ma∣king this recital of the Emperors summons to that Council directed to his Prede∣cessor, he subjoyns, His itaque mansuetissimi rerum Domini, divalibus a∣picibus animatus, & ad spem consolationis de profundis angoribus alleviatus, sum meliori confidentia paulatim, quae per mansuetissimae fortitudinis vestrae sacram, dudum praecepta sunt, efficaciter promptam obsequentiam ex∣hibere ut personas, &c. pro obedientiae satisfactione inquirerem, et cum Consilio consamulorum meorum Episcoporum, &c. ut ad pi∣issimae tranquillitatis vestrae vestigia properarent, hortarer, &c. Ideoque Christianissimi Domini filii, secundum piissimam jus∣sionem a Deo protegendae mansuetudinis vestrae, PRO OBEDIEN∣TIA QUAM DEBUIMUS (mark it) non pro confidentia eorum scientiae quos dirigimus, praesentes confamulos nostros, Abundantium, Joannem, &c. Pro quibus flexo mentis poplite suppliciter vestram ad mansuetudinem semper intentam clementiam deprecamut, ut, juxta benignissimam atque augustissimam Imperialis sacrae promissionem, acceptatione eos dignos efficiat, &c. Non enim nobis eorum scientia confidentiam dedit ut ad pia vestra vestigia eos auderemus diri∣gere, sed hoc Imperialis vestra benignitas clementer jubens hortata est, et no∣stra pusillitas, quod jussum est, obsequenter implevit. Lan∣guage inconsistent with pretended Papal Supremacie. After which this Pope tendred by them in writing to the Emperors an account of his and the Roman Churches faith out of Scriptures, former Councils and Fathers, which was read, inferringSurius, p. 920 921 Eximenda proinde, ac summis conatibus, cum Dei praesidio liberanda est san∣cta Dei Ecclesia Christianissimi vestri Imperii, de talium doctorum erroribus, &c. Haec autem ideo Deum omnipotentem felicibus vestrae mansuetudi∣nis ad emendandum credimus reservasse temporibus, ut locum et Zelum ipsius Domini nostri Iesu Christi, qui vestrum Imperium coronare dignatus est, facientes in terris, pro ejus Evangelica et Apostolica veritate JUSTUM JUDICIUM PROFERATIS, (of which this Pope acknowledgeth the Emperors Supreme Judges) Quia dum humani ge∣neris Redemptor atque Salvator, sit injuriam passus, nunc usque sustinuit, vestraeque for∣titudinis adspiravit imperio, ut ejusfidei causam (sicut aequitas exigit, & sancto∣rum Patrum, sacrarumque Generalium quinque Synodorum decrevit instructio) exequi dignemini, et redemptoris ac conregnatoris injuriam de suae fidei contemptoribus per ejus praesidium ulciscamini, propheticum illud vaticinium cum imperiali clementia magnanimiter adim∣plentes, Psal. 68. quia Rex et Propheta David ad Deum loquitur; Zelus domus tuae, inquiens, comedit me. Unde pro tali Deo placito zelo collauda∣mus, Act. 13. illam beatam vocem audire à creatore omnium meruit: Inveni David virum secundum cor meum, qui faciat omnes voluntates meas. Cui & in Psalmis
pollicetur,Psal. 88. Inveni David servum meum, oleo sancto meo unxi eum: manus enim mea auxiliabitur ei, & brachium meum confortabit eum: ut cujus causam conflagranti studio elaborat Christinae clementiae vestrae piissimus Principatus efficere, remunerationis gratia, omnes actus fortissimi eorum Imperii felices et prosperos faciet, qui in suis sacris Evangeliis repromittit,Mat. 6. inquiens, Quaerite primum reg∣num coelorum & haec adjicientur vobis. Omnes enim ad quos sacrarum apicum pervenit notitia, & quia sic benigniter augustae magnanimitatis vestrae mansuetuins est demonstratus intentus, innumer as gratiarum actiones & incessabiles landes, admirati de tantae Clementia magnitudine propagatori vestri fortissimi imperii persolverint, quia vere ut pussimi et aequissimi Principes quae De sunt, cum Dei timore dig∣nati estis peragere. Unde & laus ab omnibus Nationibus Christianis, & pernnis me∣moria, et frequens oratio pro sospitate, triumphalibus, ac perfectis victoriis concedendis, ante Christum Dominum, cujus causa est, effundantur, quatenus supernae majestatis terrore per∣culsae Gentium nationes sub sceptris vestri robustissimi Principatus humiliter colla pro∣stervant, et piissimi regni vostri continuetur potentia dum temporali Imperio aeterni regni succedit perennis felicitas. Nec enim poterit aliud simillimum inveniri, quod ve∣strae invictissimae fortitudinis divinae Majestati commendat Clemen∣tiam, quam ut repulsis a regula veritatis erroribus Evangelicae atque Apostolicae nostrae fidei ubique illustretur et praedicetur inte∣gritas, &c. Obsecro itaque piissime Auguste, atque una cum mea exiguitate Omnis anima Christiana suo flexo genu suppliciter deprecatur ut etiam hoc ad redintegrationem perfectae pietatis conregnatori Christo Domino hostiam acceptibilem offerre jubeatis; verbum impunitatis concedentes et liberam loquendi facultatem unicui{que} loqui volenti, & verbum impendere pro fide, quatenus omnes unanimiter pro tanto & tam inestimabili bono per cunctum vitae suae spatium divinam Majestatem glorificent, & pro incolumitate atque exaltatione fortissimi vestri Imperii, unanimiter incessabiles Christo Domino preces effundant. Piissimorum Dominorum imperium gratia superna custodiat, eisque omnium gentium colla substernat. Moreover thisSurius, Tom: 2. p. 922. Pope Agatho, and the Synod of Rome, begin their Epistle to these Emperors, and Instructions to their Delegates in this General Council, thus, Piissimis Dominis, ac serenissimis Victo∣ribus ac Triumphatoribus dilectis filiis Dei & Domini nostri Jesu Christi, Constantino magno Imperatori, Heraclio & Tiberio Augustis, Agatho Episcopus, Servus servo∣rum Dei, cum universis Synodis subjacentibus Concilio Apostolicae sedis. Omnium bo∣norum spes inesse praenoscitur, dum Imperiae fastigium ejus, a quo se co∣ronatum, et hominibus praefectum ad salubriter gubernandum dig∣noscit, veram de eo confessionem, qua sola prae omnibus muneribus delectatur, inquirit fideliter, et vivaciter amplecti desiderat. After which they stile Rome a servile City to the Emperor,Ibid. p. 924. Concilium quod in hanc Romanam urbem servilem vestri Christianissimi Imperii, &c. Subjoyning, Praeterea satisfaciendum est nostro exiguo familiatui a∣pud Serenissimorum Dominorum nostrorum clementiam pro tar∣ditate missarum ex Concilio nostro personarum, quas dirigi per su∣am Augustissimam sacram vestrum piissimum fastigium jussit. For which they render a satisfactory reason. Then pray, that the Confes∣sion of the faith they had sent by their Delegates might be confirmed. Ob∣secrantes, ut à Deo coronato vestro imperio favente, haec eadem omnibus prae∣dicari, atque apud omnes obtinere jubeatis, ut Deus, qui veritatem & justitiam diligit, omnia prostera vestra serenissimae dignitatis temporibus donet, in quibus Apostolicae praedicationis pietatis veritas fulgeat, meliori ac prospero successu rerum for∣tissimae tranquillitatis imperium laetari de hostium subjectione concedens. Suscipere itaque dignamini piissimi Principum, à nostra humilitate directos Episcopos, cum reliquis Ecclesiasticis ordinis viris, atque religiosis servis Dei, cum solitae tranquillitatis clemen∣tia, quatenus exipsorum testimonie cum gratiarum actione in propria revertentium, apud omnes Nationes laus Clementiae vestrae celebrescat, sicut magni illius Constantini, cujus post obitum ladabilis fama nihilominus viget, cujus insigne non tantum pote∣statis
est, sed pietatis: cum quo illud sacratissimum Concilium 318. Antistitum in Ni∣cea civitate in defensione consubstantialis Trinitatis convenit: & sicut Theodosii magni, cujus inter alias ejus virtutes, singularis pietas praedicatur; quo advitente per sancti Spiritus gratiam 250 Patrum sententia, qui eis inspirabat, Spiritus sanctus consubstantia∣lis Patri & Filio praelicatus est, & sicut egregii veritatis amatoris Martiani Principis, qui & primum Concilium Ephesinum, utpote Catholicam & Apostolicam fidem praedicans a sancta Chalcedonensi Synodo suscipi fecit, et errores qui accreve∣rant, de Dei Ecclesia repulit: Et sicut extremi quidem, praestantis∣simi tamen omnium, magni illius Justiniani, cujus ut virtus, ita et pietas omnia in meliorem ordinem restauravit; cujus instar fortis∣simae vestrae clementiae Principatus virtutis quidem conatibus Rem∣publicam Christianam tuetur, et restaurat in melius, pietatisque studiis Catholicae succurrit Ecclesiae, ut in Vnitate verae ac Apo∣stolicae confessionis perfectius copuletur, quam nunc usque nobis∣cum sancta Romana servat Ecclesia, quatenus syncerae pietatis ar∣canum, tuba clarius per totum Orbem praedicetur, et ubi hujus ve∣rae confessionis synceritas pii Vestri Imperii favoribus obtinet, laus simul ac meritum Serenissimi vestri Imperii praedicetur, ut cum pietatis laudibus, etiam regni eorum Deo annuente dila∣tentur insignia, quosque verae pietatis invitat Confessio, impie∣tatis fortitudo possideat. All these expressions of this Pope and his whole Council, resolve 1. That they all in most humble and dutifull manner acknowledg∣ed these Emperors to be their Soveraign Lords; and that they owed all humble chearfull obedience to their Summons and commands, even in matters of Faith, Religion, and Church-affairs. 2ly. That the right of summoning General Coun∣cils, and ordering, examining, confirming the Votes, Confessions of Faith made by them, belonged to Emperors, not to Popes, who were both summoned and came in person, or sent their Proxies to them in obedience to their Summons. 3ly. That the principal care, defence, propagation, preservation, perpetuation of the Or∣thodox faith and true worship of God, belongs to Christian Emperors, not to Popes or Bps. 4ly. That God had specially advanced them to the Empire for this very end; That this was the principal part of their charge, office, care; and that God himself had made, Constantine, Theolosius, Martianus, Justinian; and these present Emperors, (not Popes and Bishops) the principal Instruments of establishing, propagating, pre∣serving the Christian Orthodox faith, suppressing Heresies, Schisms, advancing true pi∣ety, and Christian peace, Unity throughout the Churches of Christ, &c. All which are since reputed Heresie, and Sacrilegious encroachments (like KingSee here, p. 25. Uzziahs) on Popes, Bishops, Priests Hierarchies, Offices, by ambitious Popes and Prelates. In the 14. Action the frauds and impostures added, and thrust into the Acts of the 5. General Council concerningSurius, Tom. 2. p. 1001, 1002, 1003, 1005, 1023. Pope Vigilius and others, were examined by the Original parchment copies there produced upon Oath, by George a Deacon Library-keeper to the Archbishop of Constantinople, where the Emperor Justinian, & Glorisissimi Judices, & Sanctum Concilium dixerunt; & directed the proceedings in this Examination. And the Council often cry out, Sancti Quinti Concilii sempi∣terna memoria. Multos annos Imperatori Constantino, Magno Imperatori multos annos. Pacifico Imperatori, multos annos. Conservatori rectae fidei multos annos. Fili Dei da illi vitam; Fili Dei, da victoriam illi. After which, Gloriosissimi Judices & sanctū Concilium dixerunt, Sufficienter quidem habent quae hodierna die gesta sunt; Polychro∣nius autem religiosus Presbyter & Monachus, in subsequenti ad nos perducatur, de propria fide sua interrogandus. Whereupon Actio 15.Ibidem, p. 1006. Residentibus per ordinem Gloriosissi∣mis Patriciis & Consulibus omnibusque venerabilibus Episcopis; Gloriosissimi Judi∣ces & Concilium dixerunt: Ingreiatur Polychronius: who tendred them an heretical Book and Confession of his faith (which this confident Heretical Impostor presu∣med would raise a dead man to life if laid upon him; which he there laying on a dead body experimented before the Synod and people, with no successe, but derision, and an exclamation by the people; Novo Simoni Anathema, novo Seductori populi, Anathe∣ma:) Notwithstanding, he obstinately persisting in his Heresie, thereupon
was degraded and anathematized; which done, Gloriosissimi Judices & Sanctum Concilium dixerunt, Sufficiunt quae hodierna die acta sunt. In the 16 Action there is the like proceeding; with a Gloriosissimi Judices dixerunt, Edicat sanctum & Uni∣versale Concilium, si quicquam de his quae ad scrupulosiorem indagationem pertinent, re∣lictum est super praesenti Capitulo, &c. Sancta Synodus dixit, Sufficienter quidem ha∣bent, &c.Ibid. p. 1010, 1116, 1118. Actio 17. They read and subscribe the Confession of their Faith made in that Synod: clozing it with these Acclamations, Christo dilecto multos annos. Or∣thodoxè omnes credimus. Illuminatorem Pacis Domine conserva. Martiano novo Con∣stantino, aeterna memoria. Novo Justiniano Constantino, aeternamemoria. Qui de∣posuit Haereticos, Domine conserva; anathematizing all these Hereticks by name. Actio 18. Prsiadente eodem piissimo & a Christi dilecto Constantino magno Imperatore, he sitting in this Council, Theodorus the Patriarchs Notary, spake thus un∣to him; Maximae pietatis exist it cognitio, tranquillissime Domine, principaliter quae ad culturam divintatis attinent praecipuam diligentiam adhibere dehinc causas quae Christo amabili Reipublicae competunt recta con∣sideratione dirigere, quod profecto benigne peragitis, mansuetissime omnem quidem secularium causarum sollicitudinem reponens, pro divinis vero curam et studium per Spiritus sancti gratiam assumens. Et hic vester est acceptabilis ornatus pietatem adversus Diaboli ac∣cersire malitiam, et contra impietatis ejus cohortem, sacrum aggre∣gare collegium, &c. Then tendring him the Synods confession of faith, (read & subscribed by the Synod the day before) to be read again in the Emperors presence, Constantinus piissimus Imperator, dixit, Edicat sanctum et universale Concilium, si cum consensu omnium Episcoporum promulgata est definitio, quae ad praesens relecta est:Ibidem, p. 1021. San∣ctum Concilium exclamavit: Omnes ita credimus, Vna fides, Omnes id ipsum sentimus; Om∣nes consentientes et amplectentes subscripsimus. Orthodoxi omnes credimus. Haec est fi∣des Apostolorum, haec est fides Patrum, haec est fides Orthodoxorum, Multos annos Im∣peratori: Integritas duarum naturarum Christi, tu declarasti; Luminarium pacis, Domine conserva. Martiano nova Constantino aeterna memoria, Omnes haere∣ticos tu effugasti, Dejectorem haereticorum Domine conserva; Dividen∣tes et conundentes tu persequutus es. Absit invidia a vestro Imperio. Deus custodiat foritudinem vestram. Deus regnum vestrum & Imperium vestrum pacificet. Vestra vita, orthodoxorum vita est. Coelestis Rex, terestrem conserva. Per te universales Ecclesiae pacificatae sunt. Nestorio, & Euticho & Se∣vero, anathema, &c. Omnibus haereticis anathema. Which ended, Constantinus Imperator dixit, Deum testem proferimus sancto & universali vestro Concilio, quod abs∣que quolibet favore & invidia, principale desiderium et zelus extitit nobis, irreprehensibilem esse immaculatam nostram orthodoxam Christia∣norum fidem, et cum stabilitate nos eam conservare in nomine Dei, secundum doctrinam & traditionem quae tradita est nobis tam per Evangelium, quam per sanctos Apostolos, & per statuta Sanctorum quinque Universalium Conciliorum, Sancto∣rumque probabilium Patrum, et non mediocriter nos pro hoc desiderium coarctabat, ex quo (jubente Deo nostro) authoraliter accepimus solium imperii nostri. Cum ergo Deo complacuit tempus concedere, invitavi∣mus fieri collectionem vestram, ad considerandum vobis Sanctas Dei Scripturas, omnem∣que vocis sive assertionis novitatem, quae adjecta est ad intemeratam nostram Christiano∣rum fidem, in his vicinis temporibus a quibusdam prava sentientibus expellendam, mun∣dissimamque nobis hanc contradendam (sicut praedictum est) quatenus, secundum Sancta & universalia quinque Concilia & statutae Sanctorum Venerabilium Patrum, ita eam et nos custodiamus usque in mortem, &c. Immediately after his Speech concluded, Sancta Synodus exclamavit, Multos annos Imperatori, Christo dilecto Impe∣ratori, multos annos; Pium et Christianum Imperatorem Domine conserva, Orthodoxam fidem tu confirmasti. Definitio Orthodoxa est; con∣tradicenti huic definitioni anathema; Qui contradixerit huic definitioni Nestoria∣nus est: Qui non susceperit hanc definitionem Eutichianista est. Eutichianis anathema, Omnibus Christo rebellibus Haeresibus anathema. Aeterna memoria
Imperatori. AEternum permaneat vestrum Imperium. The Emperor rendring them his hearty thanks for their pains in this Council,Surius, ibid. 1023. San∣ctum Concilium dixit, Piissime & tranquillissime Domine, Sermonem acclamatorium ad Deo amabilem vestram potentiam, juxta morem composuimus, et si placuerit pie∣tati vestrae, hunc perlegi jubete. Constantinus piissimus Imperator dixit, Ac∣clamatorius sermo qui compositus est a vestro Concilio, deferatur & Relegatur. Qui delatus est, & in his sermonibus relect. est. In this Oration they use these memorable pas∣ages to the Emperor. Vos enim per Christum benignè regnatis, Christus vero per vos Ecclesis suis pacem delegit impartiri, &c. Quid vero est, et praesertim Imperatori decebilius, QUAM PRAE OMNIBUS PIE∣TATE ADORNARE SUBJECTOS, PER QUOD ET IN CAETE∣RIS FELICITETUR RESPUBLICA? Veruntamen vestris divali∣bus praeceptis acquiescentes, tam antiquae Romae et Apostolicae summi∣tatis pontificatus Antistites, quam nos humiles, Christi tamen Sacerdotes at∣que ministri, &c. (Let Popes observe their predecessors subjection to this Emperors supream commands in coming to this Council, &c.) Then applauding the Piety, Zeal of Constantine, Theodosius, Martianus, and Justinian in summoning and rati∣fying the former General Councils; they thus conclude.Ibid. p. 1024, 1025. Luc. 2. Gloria in excelsis Deo, in terra pax, decantantes, dum Christo omnipotenti complacuit suscitare Principem Deo dilectum, qui unitatis Ecclesiarum mediator effectus est. Sed O Renignissime Do∣mine & Amator Justitiae, ei qui tibi potentiam largitus est hanc gratiam recompensa, & his quae a nobis gesta sunt signaculum tribue, vestram inscribito Imperialem ratihabitionem, et per Edicta divalia, atque per pias Constitutiones, ex more, eorum omnium firmitatem, quatenus nullus his quae gesta sunt, aut contradicat, novamve quaestionem machinetur. Scito enim Serenissime Imperator, quod nihil horum quae in Synodis universalibus & a probabilibus patribus constituta sunt, falsavimus, verum potius confir∣mavimus. Etenim omnes unanimiter atque consonanter acclamamus: Domine sal∣vum fac Regem nostrum, qui post te corroboravit fidei fundamen∣tum: benedicito vitam ejus, dirige gressus cogitationum ejus. Conterat virtutem inimicorum suorum, & resistentes ei continuo corruant, quia fecit judicium, & justitiam sempiternam, & periclitanti veritati manus porrex∣it, populumque tuum salvavit, ad eadem sapere eos concilians. Gaude Civitas Nova Roma Constantinopolis, glorificata nomine principali. Ecce Rex tuus fidelis sedet fortissimus, & accipiet armaturam amulatricem ejus virtutem, in∣dutus est loricam Justitiae, & Sanctitatis circumposuit sibi galeam prudentiam, quae est specula virtutum, & scutum assumpsit inexpugnabile, in Deum pieta∣tem. His armatum eum adspiciant Barbari, & speramus in Deum eos obtemperare dominanti. Laetare Civitas Sion, Cacumen Orbis terrarum atque Im∣perium. Constantinus te purpura praeornavit, et per fidem Coronavit, & Constantinus utrisque supercoronavit, Portaeque inferi adversum tuum orthodoxum Imperium non praevalebunt. Gaude, & fiducialiter age Imperator speciosissime: Dominus Deus tuus in te potens; praecingens te virtute, salvabit te: adducet super te jocunditatem & exultationem, ampliabiturque imperium tuum, & ex∣altabitur brachium tuum et dominabitur cunctis Adversis, Deumque non agnoscentibus atque attestantibus, et lamentabitur quidem hostilitas, gaudebit autem obedientia: quia ego potens sum, dicit Dominus Omnipotens. Hereupon the Emperor ratified the Confession of their Faith by this his Imperial Edict,Srius Tom. 2 p. 1025, &c. into which he inserted it verbatim. In nomine Domini et Dominatoris Jesu Christi, Salvatoris nostri, Imperator Piissimus, pacificus Flavius Constantinus, fidelis in Jesus Christo Deo Imperator, Christo dilecto omni populo habitanti in occiduis partibus. Fir∣mamentum ac fundamentum superno nutu creditae nobis Christianissimae existit Reipublicae, sides in Deo inflexibilis et inconcussibilis, in qua Christus Deus no∣ster tanquam propriam Domum suam construxit Ecclesiam, & sicut Rex omnium, imperii nostri sedem constituit, principatusq▪ nobis Sceptra commi∣sit.
sicut enim quandam Petram excelsamet sublimem, & ut coeli, terraeque, in con∣sortio constitutam mysticam confessionem, quae in eum cum. Patre et Spiritu est Salva∣tor nobis ostendit, ut per eam tanquam per mediam scalam ad caele∣stem conversationem reducamur diviniorisque regni potentia coro∣nemur. Super hanc petram cogitationis nostrae gressus infiximus, super quam firmiter stare praecipimur, quamque cautius tenere sub∣jectos praecipimus, ne quisquam, ut minus attentus, exagitetur a ma∣ligno et instabili spiritu: expulsusque atque praecipitatus in impieta∣tis voraginem delabatur, &c. Idcirco et nos quae ab eis definita sunt, corroborare atque firmare cupientes. praesens pium edictum dedimus, verae circa divinitatem fidei secundum ecclesiastica statu adnuncians confessionem. Then reciting the Confession of the faith therein comprised, he thus proceeds: In hac fide vivimus, et regna∣mus, et conregnanti nobis Deo conregnare denuo speramus. Hanc Comitem, hinc recedentes habere deposcimus, & cum hac ante Christi tribunal as∣sistere. Ad hanc confessionem omnes hortamur, et deservire Deo no∣biscum invitamus, ac super montem excelsum Imperii stantes, prae∣dicamus, atque ecclesiasticam pacem totius populi solennitatem ad∣nunciamus, &c. Si quis vero hominum personis gratiam exhibet, Charitatis au∣tem in Deum aemulatorem se non demonstrat, Praesentemque nostram piam constitutionem non recipit, siquidem Episcopus est vel Clericus, aut Monachico circundatus est habitu, deportationis poenam exol∣vet. Si vero in ordine dignitatum insertus est, supplicio proscri∣ptionis mulctatur, eique Cingulum adimitur. Si autem idioticae sortis est; ex hac Regia, omnique penitus Civitate extorris addici∣tur, et super haec omnia, etiam terribilis atque inexpiabilis judicii non effugiet cruciatum. Besides this general,Surius, p. 1031, 1034. the Emperor sent a particular coppy of his Edict, (Divinae Jussionis) concerning his ratification of this general Synod, to the Synod at Rome, whereupon, Pope Agatho being dead, and Leo the second succeeding him, writ this Epistle ad Constantinum piissimum August: by way of gratitude, most clearly demonstrating his supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, care of Religion and of his Subjects souls, as well as of their bodies and estates. Regi Regum in cujus potestate sunt Regna mundi pusilli, cui magnas gratias agimus, qui ita in vobis terrenum contulit Regnum, ut coelestia vos magis ambire concederet. Pius est enim, quod in Deo defixa mente confiditis, quam quod de collato vobis Divinitus honore regnatis. Illud enim vobis, hoc proficit omnino subiectis. Nam triumphalem Paterni Diadematis gloriam nascendo superna miserati∣one obtinetis, pietas enim vestrae, fructus misericordiae est: potestas autem, Custos est disci∣plinae. Per illa igitur regia mens Deo jungitur, per istam vero censura subditis adhibetur; illius opes inopes adjuvant, hujus au∣tem sagacitas a vero tramite deviantes emendat. Non enim mi∣nor regnantium cura est, prava corrigere, quam de adversariis trium∣phare, quia ei nimirum potestatem suam serviendo subjiciunt, cujus profecto munere et protectione imperare noscuntur. Ʋnde divinitus praeordinata vestra Christianissima pietas, & habitaculum dignissimum Sancti Spiritus in sui cordis arcano praeparans, quando Caput Ecclesiae Dominum Jesum Christum, verae pietatis regulam amplectendo, concessi sibi ab eo Regni demonstrat authorem, Sanctum vene∣rabile corpus ejus, quae est Sancta Mater Ecclesia, ut syncerus et principalis filius, largiendo atque fovendo inconcussa facit soliditate gaudere. Scriptum est igitur de vobis Clementissime Principum,Isa. 49 & de eadem Sancta Ecclesia toto terrarum orbe diffusa; Erunt (inquit) Reges nutritii tui,Psalm 98. pariterque scriptum est: Honor Regis judicium diligit, quia dum divina rebus humanis praeponitis, et Orthodoxam fidem curis secularibus incomparabiliter antefertis, quid aliud,
quam judicium rectum Dei cultui mancipatis, et sacrificium puris∣simum atque holocaustum divinae suavitatis odore flagrans, in ara vestri pectoris ejus invisibili Majestati mactatis? Haec de piissimi animi vestri proposito Christianissime Augustorum, efficaciter dici (Dei gratia operante) con∣fidimus, qua sola & error omnis evictus est, & rectitudo Evangelicae atque Apostolicae fidei cum syncera charitatis copula apud cunctos Ecclesiarum Christi praesules obtinetur. Then at large declaring his approbation of this general Synods Confession of Faith, he thus closeth his Epistle:Ibid. p. 103. Vicit novus David constantissimus Augustorum non in millibus solum, (nec enim generalem Evangelicae praeicationis victoriam numerorum vinculis quisquam poterit comprehendere) sed & ipsum Principem, & hostem, & Ducem, ac incentorem omnium malorum & errorum Diabolum, cum suis legionibus atque fauto∣ribus, per arma verae atque Orthodoxae Apostolicae traditionis & confessionis extinxit. Exulta nunc secura Sancta Mater Ecclesia, de liberatate tua saepius impugnata, sed non de∣relicta. Suscitavit Rex tuus invictissimus Christianorum Princi∣pem propugnatorem tuum, benefactorem tuum atque opulentissimum largitorem, cujus studio Orthodoxa fides recollecto splendore toto orbe irradiat, fideles omnes gratiam referentes exultant; infideles maeror atque dejectio comprimit et confundit; Ecclesiae Christi de cunctis oppressionibus liberatae, respirant, donis imperialibus confo∣ventur, principali praesidio muniuntur, quibus et domesticis ver∣bis augusta vestra benignitas Christum imitando pollicetur:Matth. 28. Ecce, ego vobiscum sum usque ad consummationem saeculi, ut Domini nostri Jesu Christi, cujus exemplis utitur, aterna ejus Regni perenni gloria patiatur, & in orbem terrarum ge∣neraliter atque perenniter ejus imperium dilatetur. Piissimum Domini Imperi∣um gratia superna custodiat, et ei omnium gentium colla substernat. Data Nonis Maiis indictione Decima. As Pope Leo thus acknowledgeth, applaudeth this Emperors care, zeal to promote, protect, propagate the Orthodox Faith; and professors thereof, suppresse all He∣resies, and his supremacy in and over all Ecclesiastical persons and causes; so likewise Surius Concil. Tom. 2. p. 896, 897. Mansuetus Archbishop of Millain, with all his Clergy, thus acknowledged the Emperors Ecclesiastical supremacy, Hereditary descent, and right to summon general Councils. Domino Serenissimo atque Tranquillissimo, & a Deo Coronato Religiosissimo Constantino Imperatori, Mansuetus Mediolanensis Metropolitanae Ecclesiae indignus Episcopus, vel universa Sanla Episcoporum fraternitas, quae in hac magna, Regia Ʋrbe convenit, aeternam in Domino salutem. Si apicem Imperialis fastigii et infulas sacratissimae potestatis; avis et proavis vestris caelitus attributum cognovimus, et pro meritorum actibus ad vos propagatum scimus, dignum est his vos aequiperare vestigiis, quorum et celsitudinem ob∣tinetis. Nec disparilia debent esse instrumenta coelestia, ubi paria possidentur Sceptra Regalia. Aemulari ergo oportet eorum Magisterium, quo∣rum documenta permanent salutaria, &c. Habes quippe probatissime Imperator specula, in quibus tuas actiones imaginari debeas. Then reciting the acts and piety of Constantine the Great, in summoning the Council of Nice against the Arrians; of Theodosius in convening the Council of Constantinople against Macedonius; of Martianus & Justinian the Emperors in calling the Councils of Ephesus, Chalcedon, and Constantinople against Eutiches, Dioscorus, and other Hereticks; they subjoyn, Haec Gloriosissime Princeps antiquorum Patrum statuta, una cum consensu Piissimorum Imperatorum definita, quae convelli vel infirmari nulla ratione pietas vestra permittat, &c. This godly Emperor Constantine deceasing before this Synod ended,Anno 679. Justinianus the 2d. his son,Surius Tom. 2. 1034. succeeding him, confirmed the confession of the Faith, and resolutions of this general Council, by his Divine Decree, directed to Pope John the 5th. where∣in are these observable passages, displaying his Ecclesiastical supremacy, care of Reli∣gion, the Orthodox Faith, and his peoples souls; and enjoyning not only the Patri∣archs, Archbishops, Bishops, Clergy, but all his Military Officers, Commanders, Cu∣rators, and civil Magistrates, throughout all parts of his Empire to subscribe the con∣fession of Faith therein accorded, which were read before, & then subscribed by them in the Emperors presence. Magnum studium, magnam sollicitudinem nos
habentes pro stabilitate immaculatae Christianorum fidei, dehinc nam∣que Clementissimum nostrum Deum adjutorem et susceptorem no∣strae serenitatis esse confidimus, adversus omnem inimicum Christo dilectae nostrae Reipublicae dum cognitum est nobis, quia Synodalia gesta, eorumque definitionem, quam et instituere noscitur Sanctum Sextum Concilium, quod congregatum est in tempore Sanctae me∣moriae nostri Patris, in hanc a Deo conservandam Regiam Vrbem apud quosdam nostros Iudices remiserunt. Neque enim omnino praevidimus alterum aliquem apud se detinere ea, sine nostra piissima serenitate, eo quod nosCopiosa. copiosos misericordia noster DeusNota. custodes constituit ejusdem immaculatae Christianorum fidei, sed mox adduri∣mus nostros Patres Sanctissimos ac Beatissimos Patriarchas, cum vesrae Beatitudinis apocrisario, et Sacratissimum senatum, verum etiam Deo amabiies metropolitas et Episcopos qui hic in Regia Vrbe commorantur, et deinceps militantes incolas Sancti Palatii, necnon et ex collegiis popularibus, et ab excubitoribus, in∣super etiam quosdam de Christo dilectis exercitibus, tam ab a Deo conservando Imperiali obsequio, quamque ab Orientali Thraciano, similiter et ab Armeniano, etiam ab excercitu Italiae, deinde ex Cabari∣sianis, et Septensianis, seu de Sardinia, atque de Africano exercitu, qui ad nostram pietatem ingressi sunt, et Iussimus praefatas Synodalium gestorum Chartas in medium adduci, et coram supradictis omnibus lectionem eorum fieri; omnesque diligenter audientes signare ipsas fecimus: eorum auditorum universitas in nostris manibus eas praebuit Chartas, ut debeamus nos tenendo inviolatas conservare ipsas, ut non licentia fuerit in quolibet tempore his, qui timorem Di nolunt habere, aliquid corrumpere, aut submutare ab his quae inserta sunt in praenominatis Synodalibus gestis, quas totas Char∣tas bene definitas in temporibus Sanctae memoriae nostri Patris, ex probabilibus Sanctis Patribus, qui propriae linguae et manuum fidem apud Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum verum{que} Deum ex∣istentem, confirmasse dinoscitur, et confitentes eam docuisse, nos spe∣ramus Clementissimum nostrum Deum, quia usque dum noster spi∣ritus statutus est ex Deo esse, in nobis ipsas Chartas illibaas et incommutabiles semper conservabimus. This whole General Synod in their Oration to Justinian, inprimis pium Imperato∣rem, use these expressions to him, evidencing that God had specially raised him up to defend, preserve, propagate the Orthodox saith, and that it was, yea ought to be his first and principal care, trust, duty, to reclaim his Subjects from sinne, and endeavor to promote the salvation of their souls, as well as their temporal welfare.Surius, Tom. 2. p. 1038, 1039. Imprimis, Pio & Christi amantissimo Imperatori Justiniano Sancta & universalis Synodus, Divi∣no Piae vestrae potentiae nutu & decreto congregata in hac a Deo Custodita & regia Civi∣tate, &c. Qui magnam hanc praesentis mundi Navem clavo assidens regit Christus Do∣minus noster, te Sapientem nobis gubernatorem, Pium Imperatorem, verè praesidem exci∣tavit, dissensantem sermones in judicio, in seculum veritatem servantem, facientem judi∣cium & justitiam in medio terrae, & in via ab omni culpa ac reprehensione aliena proce∣dentem, quem cum sapientia concepisset, eique obstetricis officium praestitisset, pulchrè virtutibus eductum & ornatum, divinoque spiritu repletum, orbis terrarum o∣culum effecit, qui mentis puritate et splendore subjectos aperte iliu∣minans, Nota cui suam Ecclesiam adhibuit, et legem ejus noctu diu{que} me∣ditari docuit, ad populorum qui sunt sub ejus manibus perfectionem et aedificationem, qui ruo in Deum desiderii ardore Phinees zelum su∣peras, et pietatis ac prudentiae robore confosso peccato, gregem quo∣que vitio et eritio subtrahere voluisti. Oportebat enim eum qui post
supernum monumentum humani generis gubernaculum suscepisset, non solum id quod ad se pertinet considerare, et quomodo sua a se vita dirigatur; sed et omnes quibus imperat, et maximis fluctibus servare, et a multa prolapsionum errorumque confusione, undique obruentibus impro∣bitatis fluctibus, et humilitatis nostrae corpus perturbantibus, eri∣pere. After which they thus humbly pray the Emperor to ratifie their Canons to make them valid and obligatory. Propterea ergo tuae pietatis jussu in hac Dei observa∣trice & Imperante Urbe congressi, sacros Canones scripsimus. Quamobrem tuam pietatem, eas quae prius in hac Dei observatrice Civitate a congregas sub bonae memoriae Imperatore nostro patribus editae sunt, voces Tibi adducentes, ut qumadmodum Ecclesiae scriptis Ecclesiam honorasti, sic et eorum, qu per viros pios et synce∣ros decreta sunt, finem obsignes. Dominus autem imperiium tuum stabiliat ac confirmat in pace ac Justitia, & generationum generationibus transmittat, & terrenae quoque potentiae adjiciat, ut etiam coelesti regno fruaris. Which he ratified according∣ly. Distinctio 69 Agatho. See Blondus l. 4. Decad. 1. Cen. Magd. c. 7.  23. Gratian,Anno 680 ex gestis Romanorum Pontificum, records this memorable Decree made by the Emperor Constantinus Pgonatus in the time of Pope Agatho, about the year 680. Agatho, Natione Siculus, cujus legatione functus Joannes Episcopus Por∣tuensis, die Dominico octavo Paschae in Ecclesia sanctae Sophiae, missas coram Principe & Patriarcha latinè celebravit. Hic suscepit ab eo divalem, id est, Regiam Episto∣lam secundum suam postulationem; per quam relevata est quanti∣tas pecuniae, quae solita erat dari (Imp.) pro ordinatione Pontificis facienda; sic tamen ut si contigerit post ejus transitum electionem fieri, non debeat ordinari qui electus fuerit, nisi prius Decretum ge∣nerale introducetur in regiam urbem, secundum ANTIQUAM CONSUETUDINEM, ut cum eorum conscientia et jussione debeat ordinatio prosperare. Item Vitalianus Natione Segnensis (Ann. 665) direxit responsales suos cum Synodica Epistola, JUXTA CONSUETUDI∣NEM, in regiam urbem apud piissimos Principes de Ordinatione sua; To which Gratian prefixeth this rubrick, electus in Romanum Pontificem non ordinetur, nisi ejus Decretum Imperatori primum praesente∣tur, &Centur. Mag. 7. c . col. 235. c. 10. col. 487 confirmationem de sui ordinatione petiisset, sicut indicat liber Pontificalis in vita sua, as the Century writers affirm.) On which Text Bartholomeus Buxiensis, and Dr. Thierry, (together with Anastatius in vita Agathonis p. 79) thus Comment. Consuetudo erat, quod electio Papae subscripta re∣presentaretur Imperatori Constantinopoli; et tunc temporis electus da∣bat quandam summam pecuniae Imperatori. Ad quam summam re∣levandam misit Agatho Joannem Episcopum Portuensem Constantino∣polim; qui in octavo Paschae in Ecclesia Sanctae Sophiae, latinè missam coram Patriarcha & Principe celebravit; et ad suam petitionem accepit Impe∣riale scriptum, per quod solita quantitas est ei relaxata, ita ta∣men (mark it) ut electio Pontificis Imperatori semper repraesenta∣retur, et cum Imperatoris conscientia et jussione, Pontificis or∣dinatio deberet prospere fieri: (or as Anastatius records it, sic tamen ut si contigerit post ejus transitum electionem fieri, non debeat ordinari qui electus fuerit, nisi prius decretum generale introducatur in Regiam urbem SECUN∣DUM ANTIQUAM CONSUETUDINEM, & CUMEjus Impera∣toris. EORUM CON∣SCIENTIA & JUSSIONE DEBEAT ORDINATIO PROVENIRE.) sicut factum fuit de Vitaliano, cujus electio fuit praesentata ipsis Principibus SICUT CONSUETUDO ERAT. And the Glosse on these words: Quae solita, superadds. Quilibet enim Episcopus dare consuevit aliquid Imperatori in electione sua, dummodo redditus Episcopales excederent duas libras auri. De San. Epis. sect. 4. Et forte tunc cum mos erat, crimen non erat, ut Caus. 32. qu. 4. Sed
nonne Imperator commisit Simoniam, relaxando illud jus sub hac conditione, ut consensus ejus requiratur in electione? Sed dic, quod non; quia prius utrumque jus habuit, unde modo alterum po∣tuit remittere; ideo autem petiitThis (a) is oisted in by Gratian, and should be omit∣ted, as the sense and context evi∣dence. (a) Papa hanc consuetudinem tolli, quia continebat speciem mali, ut. 1. qu. 1. emendari. From whence it is irrefragable by these Popes and Canonists joynt Confessions, 1. That no Pope could be elected at Rome without the Emperors privity. 2ly. That his election ought to be certifyed by an instrument in writing sent to Constantinople (when the Empe∣ror resided there) and the Emperors assent expresly given to his Election, and also a certain sum of money paid by him to the Emperor, before he ought to be admitted or consecrated Pope. 3ly. That the Emperor ought to issue out an expresse com∣mand for his consecration. 4ly. That this was no innovation, but an antient known Custom and usage even in Pope Agathoes and Vitalians time, within 650. years after Christ. 5ly. That this was a lawfull Right vested in the Emperors, which they never parted with by this Decree, though they mitigared or released the fine or first-fruits, paid upon every new election of a Pope. Therefore the subse∣quent grants made by Pope Adrian and Leo the 3. to the Emperor Charles the Great and his successors, to elect the Pope, &c. gave them no new right, but were only a preservation of their antient right used time out mind before. Which will put a period to the Popes lateHere p. 35, to 40. pretended Supremacy over the Emperor. The 12. Council of Toledo was summoned ex glorioso Eringii Regis jussu,Anno 681 in the first year of his reign;Surius Concil. Tom: 3. p. 1, 3, 8, 9. Cent. Magd. 7. c. 9. whereto he summoned Omnes in commune religiosos Provincia∣rum Rectores & Clarissimorum ordinum totius Hispaniae, & illustres aulae regiae viros, who sate and voted therein as well as his Bishops. In the beginning of this Council the King making a short, pious Oration to them, declaring how destructive all sins were to Kingdoms, if not corrected by severe Laws; and how much true faith and piety did advance, secure, honor both Kings and Kingdoms; with his desire to con∣secrate the beginning of his reign to God, by promoting the one, and suppressing the other: He delivered them a writing containing the sum of what he desired to set∣tle in this Council, with these expressions. Ecce in brevi complexa vel exarata devoti∣onis meae negotia in hujus tomo complicationis agnoscenda perlegite, perlecta discutite, dis∣cussa elimatis & discretis titulorum sententiis definite; ut pura et placens Deo vestrarum definitionum valitura discretio, & regni nostri primordia decoret exhortatione justitiae, & errores plebium digna cohibeat severitatis censura. Whereupon they receiving the wri∣ting, inserted into the Acts of this Council, pursued it accordingly in their proceed∣ings. First, they began with a publique Confession of their faith agreeable to that of Nice, & former Councils. After which they added 13 Chapters more: The 1. where∣of declares and confirms the Kings just Title to the Crown; prohibiting from thenceforth all attempts against his Title or Government by word or deed; the other Canons con∣cern the Jews, Religion, and Ecclesiastical affaires: which they clozed with a de∣vout prayer for the King, regnare feliciter, habere de clementia fructum, obtinere de justi∣tia proemium, de pietate trophaeum, &c. the Bishops and Nobles too subscribing them: This King afterwards ratified them by his royal Decree signed with his own hand; commanding them not to be contemned, omitted, violated, subverted by any, but punctually, inviolably, and perpetually observed by all his Subjects under pain of excommunication, con∣fiscation of the tenth part of their goods who had any, and fifty stripes with perpetual infa∣my to be inflicted on such who had no goods to forfeit. The 13. Council of Toledo was summoned by the same King Eringius,Anno 682 consisting of all his Nobles and Great Officers,Surius Concil. Tom: 3. p. 9, 10, 11. as well as Bishops, to whom he made a pious short speech, and then delivered them a writing containing in grosse the things he called them to consult of, and to digest into particular Titles, which they accordingly pursued; the first part of them concerned the forfeiture and confiscations of his Subjects, and the Nobility; the later, Church affairs; All these Councils of To∣ledo were like our antient Saxon Councils, consisting of the Nobility and Clergy, and enacting temporal as well as Ecclesiastical Lawes, which the King confirmed by his Subscription and Edicts. They began with a Confession of faith; because Praeconabile fignum est, illis semper negotiis interesse, quae & a pietate incipiunt, & per pietatis viscera temperantur;1 Tim. 4. Pietas enim, ut ait Apostolus, ad omnia utilis est.
Anastatius in vita Benedict. 2 Luitprandus, Albo Floriacen∣sis, Platina, Ly∣dius, Barns, Ba∣laeus. Constantinus Pogonatus the Emperor,Anno 685 by his Divales jussiones, or Imperial E∣dicts, ad venerabilem Clerum & populum, & foelicissimum exercitum Romanae Civi∣tatis concessit, Ʋt persona qui electus fuerit ad sedem Apostolicam, è vestigio absque tar∣ditate Pontifex ordinaretur. When as he could not be installed before that time, till the Emperor or his Exarch in Italy had given his Imperial assent to his election. Anno 685. Pope John the 5. received the Emperor Justinian the 2d his Edictum, confirmans sextam Sanctam Synodum,Anno 685 & alias divales jussiones, concerning several an∣nual rents and payments due to the Emperor from the Church of Rome,Anastatius, Luitprandus, Albo Floriacen, Barns, Balaeus, Platina & Ly∣dius in Joan. 5. which he miti∣gated, because Ecclesia Romana, annue minime exurgebat persolvere: This Pope yiel∣ded all ready obedience to the Emperor as his Soveraign Lord. Anastatius, Luitprandus, Barns, Balaeus, Platina, Lydius, Onuphrius, in vita Conanis. Conon being elected Pope after Johns death by the joynt consent of the Clergy, Army, and people of Rome, (who were at first divided, the Clergy electing Peter, and the Army Theodorus a Priest:) they all ut mos est,Anno 686 sent their instrument of his ele∣ction subscribed with their hands, by some of the Clergy and people, to Theodorus the Exarch for his approbation; without which he had not been admitted to the Papacy. Where this Pope received Divalem jussionem Domini Justiniani Principis, for con∣firmation of the 6. General Synod of Constantinople held by his Father; quam Synodum per∣misit ejus pietas illis palam & inconcussam perenniter custodire & conservare. Anastatius, Barns, Balaeus, Albo Floriacen∣sis, Luitprandus, Lydius, Onu∣phrius, Platina in Sergio. Sa∣bellicus Aeneid. 8. lib. 6. Cent. 7. c. 10, col. 490 491. After the death of Conon,Anno 687 the Clergy and People of Rome being divided in their election of a Pope, one part chusing Theodorus, another Paschal, both obstinately maintaining their parties; at last the greater part of the Souldiers and Clergy elect∣ed Sergius, & in sacrosanctum palatium, & exinde in Lateranense Episcopium dedu∣xerunt; whereupon Theodorus gave over his pretence, and submitted to Sergius his election; but Paschal would by no means do it, till enforced at last volens nolens; sen∣ding privily to John Platyn the Exarch of Ravenna, to come to Rome with his Judg∣es, whither he marched very privately: who forced Sergius to give him not only divers Ornaments antienly hanging before St. Peters Altar; but also One hundred pounds weight of gold, to confirm his election and purchase his peace. If Popes were thus subject to the Emperors Exarchs and chief Officers in Italy; much more then to the Emperors themselves.

Emperor Justinian An. 710. commanded Theudor his General to apprehend Felix Archbishop of Ravenna,Anno 710 and send him prisoner to Constantinople for his offen∣ces, which being accordingly executed, he had his eyes put out, and was afterwards banished into Pontica; At which time this Emperor sent an Imperial Edict to Pope Constantine, per quam jussit eum ad regiam ascendere urbem (Constantinople) qui jus∣sis Imperialibus attemperans, illico navigia fecit parari, and went to Con∣stantinople: the Emperor being then at Nice, commanded him to meet him at Nico∣media, which he did: where the next Lords day he said Masse, and administred the Communion to the Emperor. The Emperor there renewing all the Priviledges of the Church, gave this Pope leave to return again to Rome. After which Ana∣statius the Emperor sent a second Edict by the Exarch of Italy to Rome, per quam verae se orthodoxa fidei praedicatorem, & sancti Sexti Concilii confessorem esse omnibus declaravit.

Leo Isaurus in the 9th year of his reign,Anno 718 published a Decree a∣gainst Images, Ut nulla Imago cujustibet Sancti; aut Martyris, aut Angeli ubicunque haberetur, maledicta enim omnia asserebat: sending word to Rome to Pope Gregory the 2d. Si acquiesceret in hoc Pontifex, gratiam Imperatoris haberet; Si et hoc fieri prae∣pediret, a suo gradu decideret, that he would degrade him from the Papacy, as he deposed Heraclius Patriarch of Constantinople, for disswading, opposing his suppressing, defacing of Images, and refusing to subscribe his Decree against them; making Anastatius Patriarch in his stead; who concurred with him against Images. This Pope Gregory instead of obeying the Emperor herein: Tributa Romanae Vrbis prohibuit, et Italiae, scribens ad Leonem Epistolam dogmaticam non oportere Imperatorem de fide facere verbum: (a falshood in the highest degree, against all his Predecessors doctrine, unlesse qualified with the ensuing words in a right sence and subject, here misapplyed) & novitate violare antiqua dog∣mata Ecclesiae Catholicae. And to preserve himself in his See, he mutinied all the Officers and Souldiers in Rome and Italy against the Emperor, so farr as to resolve to march to Constantinople to depose him, and chuse another Emperor in his place, up∣on this quarrel of Images,Zonaras Tom. 3. in Leone. Cent. Magd. 8. c. 6. col: 357. 531, 684. Some write, that Pope Gregory the 2d. excommuni∣cated
the Emperor Leo in a Synod at Rome, and that the Emperor derided his ex∣communication, saying, Idolatra est, et ipse excommunicatus a Deo: How∣ever all accord, that he removit Romam & Italiam, necnon & omnia tam Reipublicae quam Ecclesiastica jura in Hesperiis ab obedientia Imperatoris (as Paulus Diaconus and others express it) Leonem per Epistolas tanquam impie agentem redarguens, & Romam cum tota Italia ab illius Imperio recedere faciens: wherupon the Emperor appointed several of his Officers in Italy to apprehend, depose or kill him for his Treasons; whom he by muti∣nies caused to be slain themselves.Oratio 2. De Imaginibus, p. 736. John Damascen, a Monk, opposed the Emperor in Syria, writing in defence of Images; Regum est civilis administratio: We obey thee, O King, in things that belong to civil & secular affairs, quantum ad nos spectat, the government wher∣of is committed to you; But in Ecclesiastical matters, Pastors and Bishops have delivered Lawes and Constitutions to us; We may not remove those lawfull bounds which are set un∣to us;Anno 733 as if their Canons or Decrees were of absolute force to bind Kings or Empe∣rors without their consents, which they never did. This Emperor proceeded to put many Priests as well as others to death in Constantinople and elswhere, who presumed to erect Images, and disobeyed his Imperial Edicts. Hereupon PopeAnastatius, Luitprandus, Albo Floriacen∣sis & Platina in Gregorio 3. Centur. Magd. 8 c. 8. col. 531, Gregory the 3d. who succeeded Gregory the 2. Anno 731. writ commonitory Letters to this Emperor Leo, three times one after another, to disswade him from his opinion and proceed∣ings against Images and the defenders of them, sending them by special Messengers, who were apprehended, their Letters taken from them, and they imprisoned for sundry moneths, then sent away with reproaches by the Emperor.

After which, ascendit Constantinus Imperator in ambonem, tenens Constantinum Monachum, qui fuit Sylei Episcopus, & cum orasset, voce magna pronunciavit, dicens, Constantino universali Patriarchae multos annos; creating him Patriarch of Constantinople by his Imperial power. Et deinde ascendit Imperator cum Constantino scelerato Praesule & reliquis Epis∣copis forum, divulgantes orthodoxam (cacodoxam writes Paulus Diaconus) fidem in con∣spectu totius plebis, anathematizantes Germanum Patriarcham, & Gregorium Cy∣prium, & Johannem Chrysoroan Damascenum.

And he determines, that Re∣ges & Sacerdotes merito omnes in Ecclesia perfecti vocantur, cum sint membra Reges & Sacerdotis summi; cum seipsos bene regere, cum sua corpora Domino hostiam veraciter exhibere didicerunt; as well as Popes or Priests.

Aistulphus King of the Lombards demanding an annual Tribute from the Citizens of Rome, Per unumquod{que} scilicet caput singulos auri solidos annue inferri, & threatning to besiege the City if they refused to pay it; Pope Stephen the 3d. his successor, quem cunctus populus consona voce sibi elegit Pontificem (not the Clergy alone) when he could not pacify Aistul∣phus, neither by his Petitions, nor Gifts sent unto him by his Embassadors; (obnixe per eas postulavit pacis foedera,) He therupon sent to Constantinople to the Emperor Constan∣tinus, intreating Imperialem clementiam, ut cum exercitu ad tuendas Italiae partes, modis omnibus adveniret, & de iniquitatis filiis mansolas, Romanam hanc urbem, vel cunctam Italiam liberaret. But receiving no ayd thence, and Aistulphus proceeding in his menaces and Invasions upon the Popes Territories; he thereupon writ humble Let∣ters, and sent Messengers to Pepin and Charles Kings of France, to relive them from
their oppressions. Afterwards, this Pope repaired in person to King Aistulphus to Pa∣piae; where presenting him with many rich gifts, nimis eum obsecratus est atque la∣chrymis profusis eum petivit, ut dominicas quas abstulerat redderet over, & propria propriis restitueret; sed nullo modo apud eum haec impetrare valuit. Sed & imperialis missus simisi modo petiit, & Imperiales literas illi tribuit, & non obtinere potuit. Herupon he petitioned Aistulphus (who detained him prisoner) that he would grant him leave to go into France; telling him, Si tua voluntas est me relaxandi, mea omnino est ambulandi, &c. Upon which he released and permitted him to walk into France; where coming to King Pipin and Charles his sonne, Christianissimum Regem lachrymabiliter depreca∣tus est, ut per pacis foedera causam beati Petri & Reipublicae Romanorum disponeret: (ha∣ving writ a Letter to them before inStephani 3. Epist: 3 & 4. Gent. Magd. 8: c. 10. col. 707, to 740. St. Peters and all the Saints, Martyrs, and blessed Virgins names, exhorting, praying, conjuring them to help St. Peter & the Church of Rome in this emergent necessity.) Who thereupon treated with Aistulphus, and dis∣covering his fraudulent shifts, tota se virtute professus est decertare pro causa Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae; whereupon he marched with an Army into Italy, besieged Papia, and forced Aistulphus to surrender all the Cities, Lands he had taken from the Church of Rome, De quibus omnibus receptis Civitatibus Rex Pipinus donationem in scriptis a bea∣to Petro, atque a Sancta Romana Ecclesia, vel omnibus in perpetuum Pontificibus Apo∣stolicae (edis misit possidendum, asserens & hoc, quod nulla eum copia, &c. suadere valeret, ut quod simel beato Petro obtulit, auferret. Thus he restored this Pope to his See and possessions (who had crowned him King of France against right) upon what Terms you shall hear anon, from some of his Successors. It is observable that there were no Ex∣communications, Interdicts, Anathemas used against Aistulphus or others by this Pope, to force them to obedience, which succeeding Popes introduced; but only humble prayers, supplications, tears, Petitions both to Aistulphus, Pipin, and Charles, (as the Popes Superiors, not his Underlings and Vassals,) and that for St. Peters Patrimony. Concilium apud Palatium Vernis was summoned,Anno 759 and the Canons therein made ra∣tified by King Pipins Edict, who desired,Surius, Tom. 3. p. 41, 42. Haec inconvulsa et inviolata esse, being made by his direction; quia facultas modo non sufficiat ad integrum, tamen aliqua ex parte vult esse correctum, quod Ecclesiae Dei valdè dignoscitur esse contrarium: A∣mong other things, it was decreed, cap. 4. Ʋt bis in anno Synodus fiat, Prima Sy∣nodus mense primo, quod est Martii Kalend. ubicunque Dominus Rex jusserit, in eius praesentia. So that he must both summon and preside in it. Pope Paul,Anno 757 Stephens Successor (elected to be Pope by the Roman Clergy and people quia validior & fortior erat Theophylacto,Anastat, Luitprandus, Banes, Balaeus, in vita Pauli: Pals Diaco∣nus Rerum Ro∣man. lib. 22. & 23.

Magd. 8 c. 10. 16. one Toto,Anno 768 Dux Nepesinae Civitatis, gathering to∣gether a great multitude of Soldiers and Rusticks out of Tuscia, and entring with them into Rome, in the house of Toto, elegerunt ibidem Constantinum fratrem ejusdem Totonis, Laicum existentem, to be Pope, whom many of them accompanying in their Arms in Lateranensem Patriarcham, continuo accersito Georgio Episcopo, compulerunt cum ut ordinem Clericatus eidem Constantino tribueret; who refusing at first to do it, they at last by threats and force compelled him out of fear, to ordain him a Deacon and Subdeacon at one time against the Sacred Canons: and enforced all the people to take an Oath to him; the next Lords day bringing him with a multitude of ar∣med Souldiers into St. Peters Church, he was there consecrated Pope by the said George and two Bishops more. Et sic per anni spatium & mensem unum sedem Apo∣stolicam invasam detinuit. Which Christophorus and Sergius his sonne bewailing, went to this Constantine, feining themselves to become Monks, received an absolu∣tion of their Oath from him, and then departing privily to Desiderius King of the Lombards, and Theodoric Duke of Spoletum, obnixe eundem Regem deprecati sunt ejus auxilium tribui, ut talis novitatis error ab Ecclesia Dei amputaretur. Whereupon they procuring forces from King Desiderius and entring Rome by night, after very many contests, apprehended Pope Constanine as an invader, uncanonically ordained. Then
Christopherus Pannionus, aggregans Sacerdotes ac Primates Cleri, & Optimates Militae atque universum exercitum, & Cives honestos, omnisque populi Romani coetum a magno us{que} ad parvum, pertractantes pariter concordaverunt omnes una mente, unoque consensu in persona beatissimi Stephani 4. and consecrated him Pope. After which, in a Coun∣cil at Rome, Constantine was deprived, degraded, as ordained against the Canons, the Orders conferred by him whiles Pope, nulled, and the persons ordained by him ei∣ther thrust into Monasteries, as Monks, or re-ordained: only the baptism confer∣red by them was reputed valid. After this, though Constantine excused himself, that he was made Pope against his will by the People and Souldiers, yet he was thrust Prisoner into a Monastery, and had his eyes there put out by a party of Soul∣diers, of which he died. Afterwards by the Council and assistance of Duke Mau∣rice and Desiderius King of Lombardy, one Michael Schrivianus, qui nullo Sacerdotali fungebatur honore, was elected Archbishop of Ravenna by the Officers and Army with a strong hand: whereupon this Pope sent into France to King Charles, and by his assistance procured Michael to be ejected out of his Bishoprick, and sent Priso∣ner to Rome, and Leo an Archdeacon to be chosen in his place, who was ordained and consecrated Archbishop at Rome by Pope Stephen. Hereupon Desiderius seised some lands belonging to the Church of Rome, and refused to restore them upon this Popes Petition, who thereupon sent supplicatory Letters to King Charles and Char∣lemain into France for aid against him. Upon which Desiderius marching into Rome with an Army, entred into the Popes Palace and presence with armed Souldiers, shut him up in his Palace, apprehended Christopherus and Sergius who set up this Pope, and notwithstanding his intercessions on their behalf, put out their eyes, and thrust them into the Monastery of St. Agatha and Clare Scauri, where they soon after di∣ed, and this Pope too through grief.

Pope Adrian the 1. being elected Pope after him,Anno 772 Desiderius for fear of Charles and Charlemains entring into Italy, desired Peace with him, promising with an Oath to do him all that right which he denied unto Stephen; whereupon the Pope de∣manded the restitution of the City of Faventia, the Dukedom of Ferrata, and other lands, quas sanctae memoriae Pipinus Rex, & ejus filii Carolus & Carolomannus ex∣cellentissimi Reges Francorum, & Patricii Romanorum, beato Petro concedentes, obtu∣lerunt; who not only refused to surrender them, but seised upon more. After ma∣ny supplicatory Letters for restitution, and treaties to that purpose spent in vain; Desiderius threatned to besiege Rome it self; whereupon the Pope dispatched Let∣ters and Messengers to King Charles of France, his Patron, by Sea, deprecavit ejus ex∣cellentiam, ut sicut suis Pater sanctae memoriae Pipinus, & ipse succurrer at atque subve∣niat Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae atque afflictae Romanorum seu Exarchatus Ravennentium provinciae, atque plenarias beati Petri justicias & ablatas Civitates ab eodem Desiderio Rege exigeret. Whereupon Charles by his Messengers, exhorted him to restore all these Cities and Territories to the Church: who after many Messages and Treaties, gave this peremptory answer, Se minime quicquam redditurum. King Charls here∣upon marched with a great Army into Italy, admonishing Desiderius without any bat∣tel, peaceably to restore those Cities and Lands to the Church, who yet refused to do it. After which Desiderius flying, and all his forces being dispersed, the Cities and Territories craving pardon, returned to their obedience to the Church of Rome, and took an Oath to continue faithfull to it. Charles having reduced all Places and Territories to their obedience, took his journey to Rome it self, beyond the Popes expectation:Anno 772. where being magnificently entertained, he made a New Grant and Donation of all the Lands formerly granted by Pepin to the Church of Rome, sub∣scribed with his own hand, and the hands of all the Bishops, Abbots, Dukes and Se∣cretaries then present. Then returning, he carried Desiderius and his wife Priso∣ners with him into France. This Pope Adrian, Anno 774. holding a Council at Rome, consisting of 153 Bi∣shops and Abbots, by way of gratitude, decreed the right of electing the Pope him∣self and all other Bishops, with their Investitures, and ordering the Roman See, unto Charles and his Successors; thus recorded by Gratian himself, Distinct. 63.

In which Decree these things are very observable: 1. That this Council even in Rome it self, was called, constituted by Charles, the Great, whiles Kings of France, before he was crowned Em∣peror. 2ly. That it granted to him no new thing, but an antient right belonging to the Roman Emperors; to wit the right, power of electing the Pope himself, and ordering the See Apostolick. 3ly. It granted him the dignity of a Patricius, or Pro∣tector of Rome. 4ly. That all Archbishops and Bishops in all Provinces (therefore in France and in Spain, as the Glosse observes, as well as other places) should receive their investitures from the Emperor alone. 5ly. That none of them shall be recommen∣ded, invested, or consecrated a Bishop by any person, unlesse first recommended and invested a Bishop by the King. 6ly. That whosoever should transgresse this Decree, shall not only be excommunicated, but also forfeit his goods, unlesse he re∣pented.

And in their Epistles to the Bishops, (divina voluntate, et nostra gratia jussuque sacrati nostri Imperii congregatis in Nicena Synodo:) treating of the benefits received by Christs incarnation, and his imperial office and duty, they assert: Jesus Christus primus factus summus Sacerdos, hujus appellationis reddidit NOS consortes, O viri Sacerdotes, &c. Hanc igitur ob beatitudinem quae nobis donataest, nobilita∣tisque causa qua Deus nos adoptavit, Imperatoria nostra & pia Majestas ad concor∣diam
et pacem universum Romanum Imperium erigere contendens, praecipue ta∣men sanctarum Dei nostri Ecclesiarum statum, qua possumus cura et consilio conservare intendimus. After which they granted all assem∣bled in this Synod this Liberty. Damus quoque unicuique libertatem, ut sine omni formidine eloquatur, quae secum animo deliberavit, quo veritas magis magisque elucescat: et intrepiva voce audiatur. Then speaking of Tharaseus Patriarch of Constantinople, who oft refused to ac∣cept that office when elected to it, as too heavy for his shoulders, omnibus libertatem dedimus, ut si quid adversus virum haberent, dicerent, ut purgare sese posset. After they direct, that the Letters of Pope Adrian should first be read in the Synod, Post id etiam duas quaterniones umbelicas conclusas legetis, &c. ut per  cognoscatis, quaenam sit Catholicae Ecclesiae sententia & judicium. Sancta Synodus respondit: Servet Deus Imperium eorum, producat illorum tempora Deus, au∣geat Dominos eos gratia. Then they proceeded according to their instructions. When Surius, p. 65. Tharasius President of this Synod would have caused another Book to be read be∣fore Pope Adrians Letter, contrary to the Emperors direction, Leontius gloriosis∣simus, Imperatori a Secretis, dixit, Sacra & a Deo collecta Synodus meminerit, in priore conventione, Di obserantium magnorum Imperatorum nostrorum fuisse lectas literas, in quibus mentio fiebat sanctissimi & beatissimi Archiepiscopi veteris Romae, et religiosissi∣morum Pontificum Orientis Synodicarum literarum, quas in duabus quaternionibus addu∣cimus (which they ordered to be read first) de quibus vos, quid fieri vultis, admone∣mus? Sancta Synodus dixit, Legantur libelli beatissimi & sanctissimi Archiepiscopi ve∣teris Romae. Et legit eos Nicephorus gloriosissimus ab Imperialibus secretis. The Em∣perors Great Officers and Privy Counsellors being present in this Synod, dire∣cted the proceedings therein, as these passages, &Ibid. 72, 78, 91, 127. praesentibus simul & audienti∣bus Illustrissimis juxta ac magnificentissimis Senatoribus, nimirum Petronio glorioso exconsule Patricio, & Theophilacto Comite Imperialis obsequii, Joanne regio ostiario, &c. with others there named evidence. Pope Adrians Letters there read, are thus directed,Surius, p. 64, 65, 69. Dominis piissimis et serenissimis Victoribus, &c. Con∣stantino et Irenae Augustis, Adrianus Servus servorum Dei. In the beginning of his Epistle he writes, Deus in Ecclesiae suae faciem respiciens, pie∣tatem vestram & praedestinatam Serenitatem Imperatoriae mansuetudinis, ad profe∣ctionem fidei vocare non dedignatus est, quo omnem emendari improbitatem PER VOS contigat, veritatemque in lucem perducat. Then he subjoyns, Quemadmodum enimà Superioribus haereseos schismatibus eramus con∣terrefacti; ita nunc rursum per vestram jussionem (their summons to him) exultatione sumus perfusi: nam in regia vestra Civitate ve∣nerandum Imaginum causa jussistis retractari, &c. Nuper verò per piam vestram jussionem de voluntate vestra instructi, Omnipotenti Deo pro vestro imperio precibus solicitantes, gratiarum actione gloriam istius praedi∣camus. Illud autem in stabilimentum & confirmationem regni vestri maxime fit, quod magnum opus hoc aggressi estis, quod sine mediatione vestra in hoc mundo vix fieri potest, &c. Vos autem partem habebatis cum eo, qui nunc in divina requiescit, Constantino Imperatore, & Helena ejus matre, qui orthodoxam fidem illustrarunt et confirmarunt, adeoque sanctam matrem vestram catholicam et spiritualem, Romanam Ecclesiam exaltarunt, ut plane spes sit, eorum piam appellationem in vestra cognomenta piissima et a Deo data, transituram, ut per omnem ter∣rarum orbem novus Constantinus, et nova Helena praedicetur, per quos sancta Catholica et Apostolica Ecclesia renovabitur, &c. After which relating the story of Constantines baptism; he adds, Non immemor accepti beneficii Ecclesias aedificare coepit, &c. nec alia de causa, quam ut Christi∣anissimum in lucem et veritatem, ubique multum proveheret, et omnes gentes a cultu idolorum et diabolica deceptione converteret;
which he esteemed his bounden duty. This Pope clozeth his Epistle with this submissive supplication:Ibid. p. 69. Obsecrantes igitur ex animi fervore vestram mansuetudinem attestando, et veluti praesentes genibus advoluti, et coram vestigiis pedum volutando; ego cum fratribus meis coram Deo supplico, obtestor, adjuro, sacras Imagines in ipsa Regia Vrbe, et in utrisque Graeciae partibus in pristinum statum restitui et firmari jubeatis. In this Council there areSurius, Ibid. p. 83, 90. 138, 197. many passages concerning the propagation, defence, protection of the Orthodox faith, religion, and sup∣pression of heresies by Christian Emperors; and these frequent Acclama∣tions, Prayers for Constantine and Irene, who summoned and directed this Council, Multi anni Imperatoribus, Constantino & Irenae magnis Regibus: Or∣thodoxis Imperatoribus multi anni. Custodes fidei Domine protegas: Propugnatores Ecclesiae Domine confirma. Novi Constantini et no∣vae Helenae aeterna memoria: pacificam vitam da illis Domine. Amen. As this Pope, soIbid. p. 187, 188. Tharasius Patriarch of Constantinople, in his Epistle to Constan∣tine and Irene, written from, and in the name of this Synod, stiles them: Vniversi Populi Christiani Principes ac Duces; ad pietatem veritate Ser∣monem contulistis, et orthodoxae fidei pietatisque figuram descrip∣sistis. Vnde fidelibus tanquam faces ardentes relucetis, et peri∣clitanti Ecclesiae manum porrexistis. Nam et sanas doctrinas con∣servatis, et dissidentium unanimiter concordiam gubernatis: pie∣tatis officia per vos sunt stabilitata: Quamobrem,Psalm 125 Os noster im∣pletum est gaudio, & lingua nostra exultatione.

This Idolatrous Synod of Nice,Anno 794 and Pope Adrian having confirmed not only the lawfullnesse of making,Surius Concil Tom. 3. p. 226, 23, to 252. Regino lib. 2. Cent. Magd. 8. cap: 9. col. 626, 627. but adoration of Images, and Elepandus Archbishop of Toledo in Spain having broached an heretical Opinion concerning the Sonship of Christ; thereupon King Charles the Great, Anno 794. summoned a Councila t Frankford, to which Abbot Alchuinus was called, who writAlchuini Opera, col. 901 to 1007. several Treatises against Elepandus. The Acts whereof begin thus, Sacro incitante spiritu, ac zelo fidei Catholi∣cae scintillatim subfervescente, clementissimi & tranquillissimi gloriosique Caroli Regis, Domini terrae, Imperii ejus decreto per diversas provincias regni ejus ditioni subjecta, multitudo Antistitum sacris obtemperando praecep∣tis, in uno collegio adgregata convenit. When they were sate, praecipi∣ente & Praesidente piissimo & gloriosissimo Domino nostro Carolo Rege, (Charles being not only present, but President in that Synod) jubente Rege, Elepandus his Epistle being read with a lowd voyce; the King thereupon made a long O∣ration against it; and then demanded, Quid vobis videtur? Cumque impetrata et concessa esset invisa dilatio per dies aliquot, placuit e∣jus mansuetudini, ut unusquisque quicquid Ingenii captu rectius sentire potuisset, per sacras syllabas die statuto ejus clementiae ob∣latum, deferret. Whereupon Paulinus Bishop of Aquilegia and others ten∣dred a refutation of Elepandus his Opinion, in the cloze whereof they made a large Prayer to God for King Charles his prosperous successe, and peacea∣ble Government of the Church and Kingdom, and use these expressions: Sit Dominus et Pater, sit REX & SACERDOS, sit omnium
Christianum moderatissimus gubernator, auxiliante Domino no∣stro Iesu Christo, &c. After which followes anSurius, Ibid. p. 237, 247, 248, &c. Epistle of all the Bishops of Germany, France, Aquitain, and other places met in this Synod, to the Bishops and Clergy of Spain, reciting their Summons by King Charles, Domini Regis nostri, praecipua pietate et laudabili sapientia adseden∣te et auriliante Nobis; by whose direction and assistance they had read, debated, and refuted Elepandus his Epistle: Then follows this Kings own Epistle to Elepandus, and the Clergy of Spain, with this inscription, Caro∣lus Gratia Dei Rex Francorum, & Longobardorum, ac Patricius Romanorum, Filius & Defensor Sanclae Dei Ecclesiae, &c. Wherein he refutes Elepandus his Opinion, makes a large, pious, Orthodox Consession of his faith, in imitation of Constantine the Great: adding, Hanc igitur fidem orthodoxam, & ab Apostolicis traditam doctori∣bus, & ab univerali servatam Ecclesia, Nos pro unione nostrarum partium utique in omnibus SERVARE & PRAEDICARE PROFITEMUR, quia non est in alia aliqua salus, nisi in illa. Exhorting them to return to the Church, and em∣brace this faith; Habetote Nos cooperatores salutis vestrae, Catholicae pacis auriliares, &c. In this Council he likewiseRegino.

Our famous Country-man Flaccus Alchuinus Abbas,Anno 796 (Scholar to our Venerable Beda, and Tutor to the Emperor Charles the Great,) thus defines, describes the Office, duty of aEpistola 29 col. 1539, 1540 King, with the care he ought to have of the Orthodox Faith, Church, Religion, and Ecclesiastical affairs, asserting the Emperors Supremacy over the Church and Pope himself; Regis est, omnes iniquitates, pietatis suae potentia opprimere, &c. Ecclesiarum Christi sint defensores et tutores, ut servorum Dei oratio∣nibus longa vivant prosperitate. In his Epistola 1. to King Charles the Great, (to whom he usually directed his Epistles under the stile of, a Deo dilecto, atque a Deo ele∣cto David Regi, powring out many fervent thanksgivings and prayers to God for him both in Verse and Prose) he writes, Tota sancta Dei Ecclesia unanimo chari∣tatis concentu gratias agere Deo omnipotenti debebit; Qui tam pium, prudentem & ju∣stum, his novissimis mundi & periculosissimis temporibus, populo Christiano perdona∣vit clementissimo munere Rectorem et Defensorem: qui prava cor∣rigere, et recta corroborare, et sancta sublimare omni intentione studeat, et nomen Domini Dei excelsi per multa terrarum spatia dilatare gaudeat, et Catholicae fidei lumen in extremis mundi par∣tibus incendere conetur. Haec est, O dulcissime David, gloria, laus, et merces tua in judicio diei magni, &c. Epist. 11. he writes, Tres Personae altissimae in mundo fuerunt; Apostolica sublimitas, quae be∣ati Petri Principis Apostolorum sedem Vicario munere regere solet. Alia est Imperialis dignitas, et secundae Romae secularis potentia. Terna est Regalis dignitas, in qua vos Domini nostri Iesu Chri∣sti dispensatio Rectorem Christiani populi disposuit, caeteris prae∣fatis dignitatibus potentia excellentiorem, sapientia clariorem, re∣gni dignitate sublimiorem.Col. 1462. 1502, 1503. Ecce in te solo tota salus Ecclesi∣arum Christi inclinata recumbit. Tu vindex scelerum; tu Rector errantium, tu Consolator merentium, tu exaltatio bonorum. Non∣ne Romana in sede, ubi religio maximae pietatis quondam claruerit, ibi extrema impietatis exempla emerserunt? Ipsi cordibus suis excaecati caput suum excaecaverunt. Nec ibi timor Dei, nec sapientia, nec charitas esse videtur: Then relating sundry abuses fit to be redressed both in Rome and elsewhere: he infers, Ex his omnibus tibi plena scientia data est a Deo, ut per te sancta Dei Ecclesia (not by the Pope) in populo Chri∣stiano regatur, exaltetur, et conservetur. Epist. 12. he useth these
expressions of this Charles. O dulcissime decus populi Christiani! O defensio Ecclesiarum Christi! consolatio vitae praesentis. Quibus tuam beatitudinem omnibus necessarium est votis exaltare, inter∣cessionibus adjuvare, quatenus per vestram prosperitatem Chri∣stianum tueatur Imperium, fides Catholica defendatur, justitiae regula omnibus innotescat. Ecce quid actum est de Apostolica se∣de in civitate praecipua (Roma) in dignitate excellentissima, quae om∣nia vestro tantummodo servantur judicio (not to the Popes, nor Synods) ut prudentissimo consilio sapientiae vobis a Deo datae, temperata consideratione corrigantur quae corrigenda sunt, et conserventur quae conservanda sunt; et quae clementia divina gessit pietas ex∣tollentur in laudem illius, qui salvum fecit servum suum.Col. 1506, 1611, 1612, 1613, 1649.

Epist. 14. He adds, Sanctae religionis fervore omnibus praecellis. Felix populi qui ta∣li Principe gaudet; cujus solium dissipat iniquitatem. Nam quod olim Apostolici Patres suis scriptis in confirmationem Fidei Catholicae, diversis mundi partibus peragerunt; hoc vestra sanctis∣sima sollicitudo implere non cessat. Hoc mirabile et speciale in te, pietatis mi Domine praedicamus, quod tanta devotione Ec∣clesias Christi a perfidorum doctrinis intrinsecus purgare tuerique niteris; quanto forinsecus à Paganorum vastatione defendere vel propagare curaris. His duobus gladiis (the two swords then by Gods appointment belong to the Emperor, not the Pope) venerandam excellentiam dertra leva{que} ar∣mavit divina Potentia: In quibus Victor laudabilis et Triumphator gloriosus existis. His Epist. 24. to the same King Charles, hath this Exordium; Gloria & Laus Deo Omnipotenti pro salute & prosperitate vestra; Dulcissime mi David, atque pro omni honore & sapientia, in quibus te speciali gratia omnibus supercellere fecit. Per∣petua gratiarum actio resonet, & assidua sanctarum intercessio orationum ad Deum diri∣gatur, quatenus longaeva prosperitate, feliciter vivas, valeas, et regnes, ad correctionem et exaltationem sanctae suae Ecclesiae, ut sub protectione tuae venerandae potestatis secura quiete Deo deserviat. After which craving his favor in two Ecclesiastical matters expressed in his Epistle; he concludes it thus; Tu prosperitas regni, tu salus populi; Tu Decus Ecclesiae, tu omnium protectio fidelium Christi. Nobis igitur sub umbrae potentiae, & sub teg∣mine pietatis tua divina concessit gratia religiosam ducere vitam; atque secura quiete Deo Christo deservire. Ideo sollicita mente, & pia intentione, pro tua prosperitate & salute curam habere, & intercedere justum & necessarium habemus Domine desiderantis∣sime, atque omni honore dignissime David Rex. In hisCol. 1649 Epist. 106. ad Karolum Imperatorem, he hath this passage; Unde patenter cognosci poterit, non tantum Impera∣toriae vestrae prudentiae potestatem a Deo ad solum mundi Regimen, SED MAXI∣ME AD ECCLESIAE PRAESIDIUM et sapientiae decorem collatum. Siqui∣dem praeter Imperiales et publicas curas, evangelicas quaestiones Academicis vestris a nobis enucleandas inquiritis, &c. Epistola 83 & 84. contain an Admonition of this Charles to Pope Leo, where he stiles himself Karolus Dei gratia Rex, & Defensor Sanctae Ecclesiae. Wherein among other things
he admonisheth this Pope (who promised to do him Fealty upon the certificate of the Charter of his Election sent to him) De Simoniaca subvertenda haeresi, quae sanctae Ecclesiae corpus multis malè maculat in locis. Then informs the Pope, Nostrum est secundum aurilium divinae pietatis, sanctam ubique Christi Ecclesi∣am ab incursu Paganorum, et ab infidelium devastatione, armis de∣fendere foris, et intus Catholicae fidei agnitione munire. Ves∣tram est sanctissime Pater elevatis ad Deum cum Moysi ma∣nibus nostram adjuvare militiam, quatenus vobis intercedentibus Deo ductore et datore,Col. 1730, 1748. populus Christianus super inimicos sui sancti nominis ubique semper habeat victoriam, &c. In his Poemata, Section 221. he writes thus to him. Tu decus Eccle∣clesiae, Rector, defensor, amator. And elsewhere. Rex Carolus, Ca∣put orbis; Europae venerandus apex: altaque disponens venturae moenia Romae. Purima nempe tibi sunt emendanda per orbem. O Col, 1744. Rex, O Rector, O Decus Ecclesiae: Grex est quippe tuus po∣pulus; tu pastor ovilis. Ipsa caput mundi spectat te Roma Patro∣num; Rector et Ecclesiae, per te rex rite regatur, &c. O pater, O Pastor, Rector, spes alma tuorum; Sit tibi vita, salus, sit sine fine, Vale. Most of his Writings, Poems, Epistles are full of the like expressions. In few words he writes of him,Epist: 105. Col. 1648, 1669. Williel∣mus Malmsb De Gests Re∣gum Angl. l. 1. c. 11. Cent. Magd. 8. & 9. cap. 2. Plurimos convertit populos ad caritatem Christi et laudes.

Charles the Great, whiles King of France, (the greatest Protector of the Pope, and See of Rome) by his Soveraign Ecclesiastical Authority,Anno 800 out of sacred Coun∣cils and Synods, collected a Book of Ecclesiastical Lawes and Constitutions, for the preservation and propagation of the Orthodox Faith, the peace, good government, and discipline of the Church; the discharge of his regal trust, duty, and salvation of his peoples souls which he enjoyned all Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priests, Monks Clergymen, and other his Subjects to observe, thus prefaced by himself:Fredericus Lindebrogus, Codex Legum Antiquarum, p. 829. 830. Cent: Magd: 8. cap. 7 col. 517, 518, 519. Reg∣nante Domino nostro Jesu Christo in perpetuum, Ego Karolus gratia Dei, ejus{que} mise∣ricordia donane Rex et Rector regni Francorum, et devotus Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae defensor, humilisque ad, utor, omnibus Ecclesiasticae pietutis ordinibus seu seculari potentiae dignitatibus, in Christo Deo aeterno perpetuae pacis et beatitudinis, salutem. Considerans pacifico piae mentis intuitu, una cum Sacerdotibus, & consiliariis nostris, a∣bundantem in nos nostrumque populum Christi Regis clementiam, et quam necessarium est, non solum toto corde & ore ejus pietati agregratias incessanter, sed etiam continuo bonorum operum exercitatione ejus insistere laudibus, quatenus, qui nostro regno tantos contulit honores, sua protectione nos, nos∣trumque regnum, in aeternum conservare dignetur. Quapropter placuit nobis vestram rogare solertiam, O Pastores Ecclesiarum Christi, & Du∣ctores Gregis ejus, & clarissima mundi luminaria, ut vigili cura, et sedula ad∣monitione populum Dei per pascua vitae aeternae ducere studeatis, et errantes oves bonorum exemplo operum seu adhortatione, hu∣meris intra Ecclesiasticae firmitatis muros reportare satagatis: ne lupus insidians aliquem canonicas sanctiones transgredientem, vel paternas tra∣ditiones Ʋniversalium Conciliorum excedentem, quod absit, inveniens devoret. Ideo magnae devotionis studio admonendi & adhortandi sunt, imo compellendi, ut firma fide et infatigabili perseverantia, intra paternas sanctiones se contineant. In quo operis studio, sciat certissime sanctitas ve∣stra nostram vobis cooperari diligentiam. Quapropter et nostros ad vos direximus missas, qui ex nostri nominis authoritate, una vo∣biscum corrigerent quae corrigenda essent. Sed et aliqua Capitula ex Canonicis institutionibus, quae magis vobis necessaria videban∣tur,
subjunximus. Ne aliquis quaeso hujus pietatis admonitionem esse praesumptuosam putet vel judicet, qua nos errata corrigere, su∣perflua abscindere, recta coarctare studeamus, sed magis benevolo charitatis animo suscipiat. Nam legimus in Regnorum libris, quo∣modo sanctus Josias Regnum sibi, a Deo datum circumeundo, corrigendo & admonendo cultum veri Dei studuit revocare. Non ut me ejus sancti∣tati aquiparabilem faciam, sed quod nobis sint ubique Sanctorum semper exempla exsequenda, et quoscunque poterimus ad studium bonae vitae in laudem et in gloriam Domini nostri Iesu Christi con∣gregare necesse est. Quapropter ut praedirimus, aliqua Capitula notare jussimus, ut simul nec eadem vos admonere studeatis, et quaecunque vobis alia necessaria esse scitis, ut et ista et illa aequali intentione praedicetis: Nec aliquid quod vestrae sanctitati populoque Dei utile videatur omittatis, sed pio studio admoneatis, quatenus et vestra solertia, subjectorum obedientia aeterna faelicitate ab om∣nipotenti Deo remuneretur. These Ecclesiastical Lawes of his,Captulariae Karol. & Ludo∣vici Imperato∣ris. libri 7. with the Lawes of Ludovicus Pius his sonne, and Lothorius, collected,  into 7 Books by Abbot Ansegisus (upon the com∣mand of Ludovicus Pius) contain in them all matters concerning the Orthodox faith, the Canonical Scriptures,Fredericus Lindebrogus, Codex Leg.

This pious Emperor to reform all cor∣ruptions, abuses in Doctrine, Discipline in the Churches of France, Italy, Germany, summoned several Councils under him, being present and president in most of them.

Pope Leo the 3d. being distressed,Anno 800. misit ad Carolum claves Sancti Petri, Ur∣bisque Romae vexilla, & alia  petes, ut Romanum populum Papae Sacramento fidei data subiceret, against their wills; upon this occasion, Anno 799. there was a great se∣dition raised at Rome against this Pope, whose Opposites as he was riding in procession from his Palace of Lateran to St. Laurence Church, threw him from his horse, put out his eyes, and cut off his tongue as they imagined, leaving him naked and half dead in the Streets, and afterwards thrust him into the Monastery of St. Erasmus as a prisoner; whence he escaping went into France, complained of this injury to Charles the Great, who Anno 800. marched to Rome accompanied with this Pope; where after 7. days stay calling an Assembly of the Bishops, Abbots, et omnem No∣bilitatem Francorum et Romanorum, He acquainted them, that the principal cause of his comming to Rome, and convening them now, was; De discutiendis quae objecta sunt Pontifici criminibus: ejus calumniatores mortiferum ei cri∣men imposuerunt. Rege autem hoc inquirente, cum nullus esset criminis probator, Pontifer assumpto Evangelii textu coram Rege et omni populo ambonem conscendit, astantibusque accusa∣toribus invocato sanctae Trinitatis nomine, jure jurando ab objectis se expurgavit, &c. Lo here King Charls before he was crowned Emperor sat as Supreme Judge in Rome it self, examining the Crimes objected against the Pope, who when witnesses failed, purged himself before him and all the people by his Oath, and was thereupon acquitted. Immediately after, (by way of gratitude for his restituti∣on to the Papacy, and absolution from his objected crimes) King Charls com∣ming on Christmas day to divine Service, this Pope Leo on a sudden rising from prayers, Carolo, nihil minus speranti (as Abbas Uspergensis relates, though others con∣ceive it was by his own appointment) Papa coronam imposuit, et Impera∣torem Romanum pronunciavit, et a cuncto Romano populo acclama∣tum

Post quas lau∣des, unctus ab Apostolico, et antiquorum more Principum, ab eo adoratur, ablato Patricii nomine, Imperator et Augustus appella∣tus est: WhichFastorum, l, 4.

Romani Imperii  Gracis per Papam, ad Gallos est translata, postea a Gallis ad Germa∣nos secundum beneplacitum ejus. Ita est Imperium, quod antea a coelo dari creditum fuit, nunc ad Papae manus devolutum.

Balaeus and others. But whosoever shall impartially consider these ensuing particulars, will at first discover the falsity and absurdity of these Conclusi∣ons: 1. The several Letters, supplications, addresses of Pope Hadrian, Stephen, Leo, and others, to Pipin, Carolomannus, and this King Charles, to protect and de∣send them against Aistulphus, Desiderius, the Lombards, Romans, Exarchs, and o∣ther their opposites, who deposed, expelled, and seised upon their persons, possessi∣ons from time to time; who thereupon restored these Popes to, yea confirmed them in their Papacy by their swords, and new Charters of Donations. 2ly. That they submitted themselves to them as their Lords, Patrons, Protectors, surrendred up St. Peters Keyes, and the Roman Ensigns to them. 3ly. That the Pope, Council, Nobles and people of Rome, granted the power of electing, confirming the Pope, and the Government of the See and City of Rome to this Charles and his successors. 4ly. That before he was crowned Emperor he sat as Judge of this Popes crimes, when others refused out of fear to Judge him; that after his purgation he absolved and pro∣nounced him innocent, then gave judgement of death, banishment against his false accusers and persecutors, beheading no lesse then 300 of them, as some record. 5ly. That Charles by way of conquest got actual possession of Rome and Italy; made himself Emperor thereof, his son Pipin King of Italy, and this Leo actual Pope, by his own sword alone, not by this Popes antecedent gift or donation, who never had any pre∣cedent right in, or possession of them. HenceChroncon. Lib. 5. c. 31, 32. Otto Frisingensis andCited by Dr.  De∣fence of Con∣stantine, c. 14. p. 322. to 344. sundry others truly observe, Qualiter Carolus, assumpto Pontifice totoque populo, Augustus voca∣tus, Imperium a Gracis ad Francos transtulit; Hujus virtute Regnum Francorum plurimum augmentatum est, omniumque Regnorum Maxi∣mum, Romanum scilicet, ab Oriente ad Occidentem translatum, Not by the Popes or St. Peters authority, as Pontificians fancre. 6ly.See Masilius, Patavinus, De∣fensoris Pacis, pars. 2. c. 17. 24, 25. That all this Popes Pre∣decessors were subject to the Emperors, their elections approved, yea their per∣sons judged, deposed by them from time to time, as the premises evidence. 7ly. That the people ofSigonius de Regno Ital. l. 4 Anastatius in Leone 3. Dr.  Defence of C∣stantine, c. 14. p. 327, 328, 333. to 340. Rome by their unanimous acclamations and assents, rather ele∣cted and made Charles their Emperor, then the Pope, (who only declared, anoin∣ted, crowned him Emperor, ministerially, as other Archbishops and Bishops crown their Kings, as Cardinals, Bishops crown Popes themselves) not authoritative∣ly, as disposers of their Crowns, Empires, Kingdoms, as Supream Lords thereof. 8ly. That this Pope, together with the people of Rome, and all present at Charls his Coronation cryed out, That God had made and crowned him Emperor (by his providences and his own victorious successes) not the Pope, or Romans, as Carolo Augusto A DEO CORONATO, &c. resolves. 9ly. That as theSee here, p 22. 23. High Priests and Priests anointing and crowning of David, Solomon, and other Kings of Judah and Jerusalem by Gods appointment under the Law, gave them no Jurisdicti∣on or superiority over their persons or Kingdoms: So the Popes and Bishops an∣nointing, crowning of Emperors, Kings under the Gospel, (warranted by no Gos∣pel precept or president of Christ, Peter, or any other Apostle, Bishop, Priest) can much lesse do it. Hence Thomas Waldensis (though a great Champion for the Popes and Bishops Jurisdiction and Supremacy) dogmatically resolves: 1. Regia
potestas prima sui origine a Deo est, non a Sacerdoe. 2. Quanquam ministerio Epis∣coporum Regibus imponaturUnctio et Co∣ronatio nihil praestant Impe∣riali potestati, sed sunt tan∣tummodo solen∣nitas & siunt honoris & offi∣cii causa, non necessitatis; nec quicquam hac actione Caesari∣bus accedat: as Jacobus Almain, De Potestat. Eccles. & Laic, qu. 2. c. 10. Cu∣saus l. 3. c. 4. Hieronimus Bal∣bus de Corona, p. 68. Lupoldus de Jre Reg. & Imperat. cap. 4 & 11. Dr. Ca∣kenthorps defence of Costantine, c. 14. p. 341, 34. resolve. Corona, et insignia conferantur, non est propterea dicendum, Regiam illam dignitatem ortum habere a sacerdote. Quanquam ministerio Episcoporum solemnitates ad∣hibentur Regibus unctionis, jusjurandi, fidei et coronae; non ta∣men habet regia illa dignitas ortum a Sacerdotio, quanquam per ministerium Sacerdotis hoc habet a Deo; sicut nec ordinatus quis∣quam habet ordinationis ortum a Praesule, aut Sacramentum Eu∣charistiae a Sacerdote quolibet celebrante; ab homine enim est so∣lennitatis ministerium: Deus vero solus largitur officium. Which he proves by St. Chrysostom, Tom: 1. Hom. 1. De Unctione Samuelis in David Regem: On whose words he observes: Palam dicit, Deum coronasse Regem quem homo despexit, et ungitur quidem Ministerio hominis, sed Dei nutu. Ita quidem est et per hoc evidens, quod a Sacerdo∣te non habet Rex originem. Vel iterato concludimus, quod Sacerdoti∣um initium habet a Duce, quia Moyses unxit Aaron, Levit. 8. Nec ta∣men hoc verum est, nec quod autumat Doctor Adam, ideo regnum Cain defecisse, quia sine Sacerdote regnavit. Thus he most solidly and unanswerably determines: which quite subverts the Popes Supremacy over the Emperor from his bare designation, unction, coronation of him. 10ly. That allSee Dr. Cra∣kenthorps De∣fence of Constan∣tine, p. 323, to 341. where it is largely evi∣denced. the People of Rome and other Prelats present at this Coronation had a hand, voyce in this designation and coronation of Charles to be Emperor, & in translating the Empire to him from the Germans, as much as this Pope: Will it therefore follow, that all and every of them there present paramount the Emperor, or Kings, and might dispose of the Emperor, Empire and Italy at their pleasure? If yea: then each of them was as great and omnipotent as this Pope. If not, then the inference is most absurd. 11ly.Defensori. Pacis, pars 2. c. 30. Marsilius Patavinus long since thus discovers and refutes this inse∣rence of the Pope and his Parasites. Quae autem finaliter addebatur deductio, quoni∣am secundum Jurisdictionem ille superior est ad Romanum Imperatorem, ipsumque de jure instituere atque deponere potest, qui transtulit Imperium a Graecis in Germanos in persona Magni Caroli. Hic autem est Pa∣pa Romanus. Ergo Imperatoris superior, ipsumque instituere at∣que deponere potest. Dicendum, quod si major indefinite sumatur, ex ipsa cum minore nihil infertur, propter non fieri syllogismum ex indefinita cum particulari. Si vero signatur universaliter, ut dicatur; Omnis translater imperii Romani a Graecis i Roma∣nos, superior est, &c. nisi determinetur subjectum, quam plures haberet haec propositio veras instantias. Si enim quis de facto & non de jure transtulisset imperium; aut si a∣liena, ceu sibi ab altero tunc data potestate ad hoc, tanquam procuratori, vel quasi; qui sic inquam transtulisset (as this Pope did to Charles) non propter hoc solus superiorem Juris∣dictionem haberet, nec potestatem justam Romanum Principem instituendi aut deponendi. Si vero determinata jam dicta priori propositione, ut omnis mortalis qui transtulit, aut transferre potest Romanum Imperium a Graecis in Germanos juste, autoritate propria, non sibi concessa per alterum, superior est secundum coactivam jurisdictionem ad Roma∣num Principem, ipsumque juste instituere atque deponere potest; Quae huic annectitur se∣cunda, videlicet, Romanus Episcopus, sive Papa est, qui transtulit Imperium, ut dictum est; neganda est tanquam omnino falsa; Nam eius opposita demon∣strata est, l. 1. c. 15. &c. per Scripturam, & dicta Sanctorum atque catholicorum Doctorum, Lib. 2. c. 4, 5. sicque observatum de facto sine reclamatione fuisse per anti∣quos patres et pastores Romanos Episcopos, persuasimus (21. hujus) ex approbatis histo∣riis, Esto igitur Imperii translationem a Graecis in Germanos juste factam, &c. Dico ta∣men, quod non authoritate Romanae Papae solius, aut cum suo solo collegio Clericorum, ut pridem diximus. Et propterea oportet attendere (secundum demon∣strationes inductas, c. 12. 13, & 15. lib. 1.) quod ejusdem est autoritas prima secundum rationem rectam intendentibus, leges humanas statuendi, principatum instituendi, Principem assumendi, authoritatem illi concedendi, & haec omnia mutandi, destruendi, augendi ve minuendi, suspendendi, corrigendi, deponendi, transferendi, recreandi, & reliqua faci∣endi
circa ea quae jam dictam aut horitatem habenti principaliter, non ab altero expedire videntur, & per suam expresserit voluntatem: Cujus autem sit auctoritas supradicta, deter∣minatum est, c. 12, 13. l. 1. (viz.) Legislator vel causa legis effectiva prima ac propria, esse populus, seu Civium Vniversitas, aut ejus valentior pars (quantitate) per suam electionem, vel per voluntatem in generali civium congregatione per sermonem expressam, praeci∣pientem vel determinantem aliquid fieri vel remitti, circa civiles actus humanos, sub poena vel supplicio temporali) Propter quod ubicunque legatur, & a quocunque dicatur transla∣tum fuisse Imperium, aut alter quicunque Principatus, aut Princeps aliquis qui per electi∣onem assumitur, institutus per Papam, vel aliam personam singularem, aut per Collegium sin∣gulare aliquod provinciae sive regni: si vera debeat esse Scriptura vel sermo, et valida seu justa institutio, sive translatio talis, oportet fieri, aut factam esse autoritate Legislatoris primi in provincia vel provinciis, super quas, a quibus, et ad quas debet institutio aut translatio fieri, aut facta fore. Ideo{que} translatio Imperii Romani, vel Imperatoris alicujus institutio, dicatur aut scriba∣tur ritè facta fuisse per Papam Romanum solum, aut per ipsum cum suo solo collegio Cleri∣corum, & verum sit hujusmodi dictum aut scriptum, oportet translationem aut institutionem jam dictam per ipsos intelligere factam, per autoritatem illis concessam adhoc a Ro∣mani Imperii Legislatore humano supremo, per medium, aut sine medio, vel ab eis quidem non factam simpliciter, sed modo quodam, ut publicatam vel pronunciatam, autori∣tate tamen praedicta. But neither this Pope nor his successors had any such authori∣ty, either from the rightful Roman Emperor Leo, then residing at Constantinople, nor from the Universality or majority of the Nobles, Princes, Bishops, Clergy, People of the then Roman Empire, thus sodenly at Rome to translate the Empire from the Greci∣ans to the French, and to intail it upon them; nor yet from God himself, or St. Peter, as I have proved at large in the precedent Chapters; and Marsilius Patavinus in his two whole Books intituled Defensor Pacis: Therefore it must needs be altogether illegal, invalid, injurious, yea an Antichristian Usurpation, as the forecited, together with Dr. Barnes, Balaeus, the Century Writers, Morney, Jewel, withDr. Craken∣thorp his De∣fence of Constan∣tine, cap. 14. other Prote∣stant Writers censure it; and the ill effects thereof, in sowing the seeds of perpetual enmity, desolation, schisms, wars between the Emperors, Churches, Bishops of the East and West, and since that between the Popes and German Emperors, unde tot strages, tot incendia, tot regnorum vastationes, schismata & bella plusquam civilia sub∣secutae sunt, as Heronimus Marius,Acta Pontif. Romanorum in Leone 3. Balaeus, and others observe. All which conside∣red, the Pontificians grand Argument of the Popes Supremacy over all Kings, king∣doms, the Roman and Grecian Emperors and Empires, to remove and translate them at their Papal arbitrary pleasures, must fall quite to ground.

John,Anno 806 a Bishop, being violently and in a strange manner murdered in Gas∣coigne; thereupon 32 Archbishops and Bishops assembled in a Synod apud Theodoms villam in the County of Lutzenberg, and having drawn up a Writing, inflicting Ecclesi∣astical & pecuniary punishments on those who should assault or murder any Bishop, Priest, or Clergy man, tendred them to the Emperor Charles the Great, his Princes and peoples consideration and approbation; Si Principibus placuerit, aliisque fidelibus suis, rogamus, ut conlaudetur et subscribatur.

This Synod having drawn up 26. Canons, submitted them to his Royal cen∣sure, to correct, disapprove, or ratifie them at his pleasure. Haec igitur sub brevitate quae emendatione digna persperimus, poscentes ejus Cle∣mentiam, ut si quid hic minus est, ejus prudentia suppleatur, si quid secus quam se ratio habeat, ejus judicio emendetur; si quid rationabi∣liter taxatum est, ejus adjutorio, divina opitulante Clementia per∣ficiatur. A clear acknowledgement of his Ecclesiastical Supremacy in and over Councils themselves, all their Canons concerning the Confessions of Faith, Sa∣craments, Bishops, Priests, and all Ecclesiastical affairs, being thus totally submitted to his judgement to alter, diminish, enlarge, reject or ratifie at his pleasure. Surius Con∣cil. Tom. 3. p. 274, 278. Cen∣tur. Mag. 9. c. 9 de Synod.

Exhorting and admonishing all Bishops and Priests, ut operam darent, & actibus eminerent, quibus & se bene operando, & sibi commissos verbo & exemplis instruendo, regeret: Whereupon the Bishops, Abbots, and Clergy in this Sy∣nod, quod a tanto Principe nobis injunctum est, pro parvitate no∣stra, pauca, quae ad tantum opus pertinere advertimus, et quae se∣cundum Canonum Regulam emendatione indigent, distincte per Ca∣pitula adnotavimus, serenissimo Imperatori nostro ostendenda. After which, compiling 51. Canons (whereof the first is for the inviolable observa∣tion of their faith and allegiance to, and constant praying for the Emperor and his sons) they thus submit them wholly to his judgement to confirm or disallow. Haec nos in Conventu nostro ita ventilavimus; sed quomodo deinceps pi∣issimo Principi nostro, de his agendum placebit, nos fideles ejus famuli, libenti animo, ad nutum et voluntatem ejus parati su∣mus.

Their Canon 3. begins thus. Oportet etiam, ut sicut Do∣minus Imperator Carolus, vir singularis mansuetudinis, fortitudinis, prudentiae, ju∣stitiae & temperantiae praecepit, scholas constituant, in quibus & literaria solertia disciplinae, & sacrae scripturae documenta discantur, & tales ibi audiantur, quibus merito dicatur a Domino; Vos estis sal terrae, &c. Their Canons being drawn up as the Emperor prescribed: In the Cloze they thus submitted them to him: Haec itaque pauca de pluribus quae necessaria perspeximus, cum magna brevitate Do∣mini Imperatoris prudenti judicio praesentanda adnotavimus; To confirm, alter, inlarge, or reject, as he thought fit in his Royal Judge∣ment. The famousSurius Con∣cil. Tom. 3. p. 285. Centur. Mag. 9. c. 9. de Synod. Council of Mentz under Charles the Great who summoned it,Anno 813. consisted of 3. several Companies, sitting distinct one from another, The 1. of Bishops and other Clergymen; The 2. of Abbots and religious persons; In tertia denique turma sederunt Comites & Judices, in mundanis legibus decertantes, &c. All which concurred in the 56. Constitutions there made, as, In his itaque om∣nibus omnes decrevimus, &c. with the Acts of this Council attest. The Preface of the Bishops and Clergy to this Council, begins thus. Gloriosissimo & Christianissimo Im∣peratori Carolo Augusto, verae religionis Rectori, ac defensori Sauctae Dei Ecclesiae; una cum prole sua ejusque fidelibus, vita & salus, honor & benedictio, cum
victoria sine fine mansura. Then relating their proceedings so soon as they assembled in this Council; they adde: Consona voce gratias agimus Deo patri Om∣nipotenti, quia sanctae Ecclesiae suae tam pium et devotum in ser∣vitio Dei concessit habere Rectorem, qui suis temporibus sacrae sa∣pientiae fontem aperiens, oves Christi indesinenter sanctis reficit alimentis, ac divinis instruit disciplinis; Christianumque popu∣lum indefesso labore amplificare conatur, hilariterque Christi hono∣rat Ecclesias, ac de fauce diri draconis multorum animas studet e∣ripere, et ad sinum sanctae matris Ecclesiae revocare, atque ad gau∣dia paradisi, atque ad regna coelestia omnes communiter invita∣re, sanctaque sapientia sua devotissimo studio caeteros Reges terrae transcendens. If this were not the principal part of his Imperial, Regal office, care, trust, duty, these Bishops, Clergymen, and this whole Council, would never have thus blessed God, nor applauded the Emperor, nor left this testimony of his transcendent piety, care of the salvation of all his Subjects and peoples souls to poste∣rity: In this Council they compiled 56. Canons and Constitutions; which they thus most humbly tendred and submitted wholly to the Emperors royal wisdom or plea∣sure. Surius. Ibidem p. 286. De his tamen omnibus valde indigemns vestro adjutorio, atque sana doctrina, quae et nos jugiter admoneat, atque clementer erudiat, quatenus ea quae paucis subter perstrinximus capitulis, a vestra authoritate firmentur: si tamen vestra pietas ita dignum esse judicaverit, et quicquid in eis emendatione dignum reperi∣tur, vestra magnifica imperialis dignitas jubeat emendare: ut ita emendata, nobis omnibus et cunctae Christianae plebi, ac posteris nostris proficiant ad vitam, et salutem, et ad Gloriam sempiter∣nam, vobisque inde merces, honor, et laus, et benedictio ac beati∣tudo permaneat in omnes aeternitates seculi, Amen. Tue Council of Rhemes, Anno 813.Anno 813. (a Domino Carolo piissimo Caesare more priscorum Imperatorum congregato,Surius Con∣cil. Tom. 3. 9. 291, 293. writes Surius) made severall Ca∣nons and Constitutions which they intreated the Emperor to ratifie: witness the 33, 41, 42, 43, 44. Canons, wherein we have these passages. Domini Imperatoris mi∣sericordia imploranda, ut victum & necessaria a sibi Praelatis consequi possunt san∣ctimoniales, & vita illarum & castitas secundum fragilitatem sexus diligenter provisa tueatur. Ʋt Dominus Imperator, secundum statutum bonae memoriae Domini Pipini, misericordiam faciat, ne solidi qui in lege habentur, per Quadraginta denarios discur∣rant, ut in sua eleemosyna firmiter statuat, ne quilibet in suum pergentibus servitium, ul∣latenus prohibere audeat mansionem, neque aliis quibus necessitas incumbit: Ʋt ejus magnificum, et cuncto Imperio ejus, suis et futuris temporibus fir∣metur Capitulum, sive ab anno 30, a quo adhuc testes haberi possunt, seu etiam ab illo, a quo felicissimum ejus sumpsit exordium, qualiter omnes lites & jurgia in sua mi∣sericordia terminum habere potuissent. Ut de falsis testibus ejus simili modo piissimum firmetur capitulum, qualiter & hoc, quod ille Bononiae statuit, firmissimum habea∣tur, & adhuc quaermur, quatenus in sua piissima misericordia, si qua necessaria sunt augeantur, &c. All these Canons standing at the Emperors curtesie to ratifie, proves undeniably, that without his approbation and confirmation, they were meer nul∣lities. Wherefore Aistulphus Archbishop of Mentz, (asEccles. Galli∣canae decreto∣rum Addita∣menta ad tit. 20. l. 51. p. 1371. Bochellus informs us) spake thus in that Synod; Si Principi placuerit aliisque fidelibus suis, rogamus, ut conlaudetur, et subscribatur. Et conlaudatum est, et subscriptum est, tam a Principe quam a caeteris omnibus. Otto Frisin∣gensis Chron. l. 5. c. 33. Abbas Uspergensis Chron. p. 180, 181. Ludovicus Pius his son succeding this Emperor Charles,Anno. 815. in the 1. year of his raign, (before he was crowned Emperor) was informed, that Pope Leo had commanded some Chief men in Rome to be slain, for conspiring against him. Ad quod perscrutandum, vocatum ad se nepotem suum Bernardum, Italiae Regem, Romam misit: qui in urbe informatus, rei eventum per Heroldum Comitem Augusto mandavit: Leo quoque missis ad Imperatorem nunciis, de his quae sibi im∣posita
erant, se expurgavit. Legati de his quae Domino suo objicie∣bantur, regi Ludovico per omnia satisfecerunt. Lo here the Empe∣ror in Rome it self, inquired by his Delegates of the Popes crimes for which he was accused, who by his special Legates purged himself from them before the King, and gave him full satisfaction therein. This Pope Leo confirmed the forecited Decree of Pope Hadrian his Predecessor, Jus eligendi Romanum Pontificem, ordinan Romanam sedem, & consedendi investituras Episcopis, &c. ratum habens; asPontificum Romanorum vitae, p. 91, 92. Dr. Barnes and others record: Neither was this a Novelty in that age, since Pope Leo the 1. (asDistinctio 63 cap. Vota. Gratian resolves us) by this his Papal Decree, declared it near 270. years before. Vota Civium, testimonia populorum, honoratorum arbitrium, & electio Clericorum in ordinationibus Sacerdotum constituantur. Princibus vero atque Imperatoribus electiones Romanorum Pon∣tificum atque aliorum Episcoporum referendas, USUS ET CON∣STITUTIO TRADIDIT, pro schismaticorum atque haereticorum dissentionibus, quibus nonnunquam Ecclesia Dei concussa, peri∣clitabatur: contra quos legibus fidelissimorum Imperatorum fre∣quenter Ecclesia munita legitur. Representabatur ergo electio Cleri coram Principibus, ut eorum authoritate roborata, nullus hae∣reticorum vel schismaticorum auderet contraire; et ut ipsi Princi∣pes tanquam devotissimi filii in eum consentient, quem sibi in Pa∣trem eligi viderentur, ut in omnibus suffragatores existerent; sicut Valentinianus beato Ambrosio legitur dirisse, Noli timere, quia Deus qui te elegit, semper te adjuvabit, et ego adjutor et defensor tuus ut meum ordinem decet, semper eristam. On which Bartholomeus Bu∣xiensis, and Dr. Thierry in their Glosses, observe. Hic duplex ratio redditur quare quondam Regibus et Imperatoribus electiones representaban∣tu: scilicet, ut nullus haereticorum et schismaticorum electionem con∣traveniret, pro quibus saepe Ecclesia periclitabatur, et ut ipsi Prin∣cipes tanquam filii devotissimi, consentirent in electum, quem sibi vi∣derint in patrem eligi &c.

Stephen the 4th.Anno 816 without the Emperor Ludovicus his privity or license, was elected and consecrated Pope in his place, con∣trary to Law; and the Decrees of Pope Adrian, Leo, and this ancient usage: who post completam solenniter consecrationem suam, quam maximis potuit itineribus ad Impe∣ratorem venire contendit, Legatis cum excusationibus de sui consecratione praemissis; qui ejus animum lenirent. Meeting Ludovicus at Rhemes, and giving him an ac∣count of his comming to him, to expate his offence, eum impositione diadematis co∣ronavit, Romanorum{que} Imperatorem procla navit, eique omnem populum Romanum sid lita∣tem cum juramento promittere procuravit. Moreover he published this decree in confir∣mation of the Emperors right in electing Popes, though with some allay, thus record∣ed byDistinctio 63 cap. Quia. Gratian, Stephanus Papastatuit, dicens, Quia sancta Romana Ecclesia (cui Deo authore praesidemus) a pluribus patitur violentias Pontifice obeunte, quae ob hoc inferuntur, quia absque Imperiali notitia Pontificis fit electio et con∣secratio, nec canonico ritu et consuetudine, ab Imperatore directi sunt Nuncii; qui vetent scandala fieri; Volumus, ut cum instituendus est Pontife, convenientibus Episcopis et universo Clero, eligant praesente Senatu et populo qui ordinandus est, et sic ab omnibus electus praesentibus Legatis Imperialibus consecretur, nullusque sine periculo sui juramenta vel promissiones aliquas nova adinven∣tione audeat extorquere, nisi quae antiqua erigit consuetudo, ne vel Ecclesia scandalizetur, et Imperialis magnificentia minuatur. On which Papal Decree, Dr. Thierry, Bartholomeus Buxiensis, and the ordi∣nary Glosse thus descant and paraphrase, Quia, Casus, Roma∣na Ecclesia saepe patiebatur molestiam in obitu Papae in electione
successoris quia Nuncii Imperatoris defuerant: ideo statuit Stepha∣nus, quod electio Papae non fieret, nisi praesente populo, et Senatu, et Imperatore, vel ejus Legatis, ut scandala removeantur, et eis prae∣sentibus consecretur, et nullus audeat extorquere juramenta vel promissiones nisi quae fuerint de antiqua consuetudine. This Pope Stephanus the 4. durst not presume to consecrate the Bishop of Reatine when elected by the Clergy and people,Anno 817 till his election was first approved and ra∣tified by the Emperor Ludovicus his special Patent, according to ancient custom, as appears by his Letter to Earl Guide, registred byDistinctio 63. c. Lctis, Pla∣tina, Stella.  Ste∣phano 4. Gratiam, who prefixeth this Rubrick to it. Imperatoris Epistola in electionis confirmatione desideratur. Lectis sagacitatis vestrae , quod defuncto Ecclesiae Reatinae Antistite, Clerum & Plebem eusdem  futurum Antistitem & a Nobis consecrandum, vestro studio directum ess, ne ipsa Ecclesia diu sine proprio constat Pastore, fatebantur: nos de obitu prioris dolen∣tes, nunc ipsum lctum unanimitate & Canonica ipsius Ecclesiae electione ut mandastis tam citissime ordinare omisimus, eo quod Imperialem nobis (ut mos est) absolutionis minime detulerit Epistolam: pro qua scilicet re ambiguum est nobis; ideo voluntati vestrae in hoc parere distulimus, ne Augustalis animus durissime hoc quocunque modo perciperet. Sed scientes Ecclesiam Dei sine proprio diu pastore non debere consistere, gloriae vestrae Mandamus (quoniam aliter nos agere non debuimus) ut a vestra so∣lertia imperiali, ut prisca consuetudo dictat, percepta licentia, et nobis, quemadmodum et vos scire credimus, Imperatoria directa Epistola, tunc voluntati vestrae de hoc parebimus, eundemque elec∣tum Domino adjuvante consecrabimus, quod Charissime fili mole∣ste nullo modo suscipias. Not long after, this PopePlatina, , Barns, Balaeus in Stephano 4. Cent. Magd. 9. col. 49. Stephen Ludovici pii pie∣tate, probitate, & longanimitate animadversa, fingens jus Carolo & Successoribus ejus, a Pontifice Hadriano 1. & Leone 3. (viz.) eligendi Romani Pontificem, or∣dinandi Romanam sedem, et concedendi investituras Episcopis, &c.) pluri∣mum mali secum trahere, jus illud abrogabat, pronunciatque, jus eligendi Pontificis, debere esse penes Clerum, Senatum, populumque Romanum. Ne vero Imperator suum jus asseret vi, addidit Decreto Hadriani 1. & Leonis 3. interpretationem: Pontificem Romanum eligere licere ine Imperatoris auctoritate; sed non licere consecrare, sine praesentia Casaris, vel Caesariorum Legatorum. Post haec tempora Impe∣ratoribus invitis electionem Pontificis & investituram Episcoporum, Romana se es (paula∣tim) sibi usurpavit. After which this Emperor by his perswasions released his right and Prerogative in electing and confirming the Pope, formerly granted by Pope A∣drian, and Leo, illam tantum praerogativam Imperatoribus servans, ut electus & conse∣cratus Pontifex ad stabiliendam amicitiam Legationem mittat Regibus Francorum. Gratian, Di∣stinctio 63: A∣nastatius, Pla∣tina, Balaeus, Barns, & others in Paschali 1. vita. Naucicrus et Sabellicus. Ego Ludovicus Imperator Romanus Augustus, Statuo et con∣cedo per hoc pactum confirmationis nostrae, tibi beato Petro Principi Apostolorum, et per te Vicario tuo Domino Paschali Summo Pon∣tifici et successoribus ejus in perpetuum, sicut a predecessoribus ve∣stris usque nunc in vestra potestate, et ditione tenuistis et disposui∣stis Romanam Civitatem, cum Ducatu suo, et suburbanis at{que} villi∣culis omnibus et territoriis ejus montanis, et maritimis littoribus et Portubus, seu cunctis Civitatibus, Castellis, oppidis ac vil∣lis in Tusciae partibus. Idem, quando divina vocatione hujus sa∣cratissimae sedis Pontifex de hoc seculo migraverit, nullus ex regno nostro aut Francus, aut Longobardus, de quibussibet parte homo sub nostra potestate constitutus, licentiam habeat contra Romanos aut publi∣ce aut privatim conveniendi aut electionem faciendi, nullusque in Civitatibus aut in Territoriis ad Ecclesiae beati Petri Apostoli po∣testatem pertinentibus, aliquod malum praeterea facere praesumat, sed liceat Romanis cum omni veneratione, et sine qualibet pertur∣batione

This Pope Stephen dying within 3. moneths after his return to Rome,Anno 817 Paschalis the 1. was elected by all the Priests,Abbas Vpe∣gensis Chron: An. 817 cap. 110 : l. 4. c. 110. Phil: , Historia , p. 152. Platina, Dr. Barns & Balaeus in Pischalis 1. vita  vi∣ci, Cent. Magd 9. col. 322, 33 341. 404. Clergie, as also by the Nobles, and all the People of Rome, & consecrated contrary to the forementioned Decrees of his predecessors, with∣out the Emperors license first obtained, or his Embassadors assent to, or presence thereat. Whereupon post completam solenniter ordinationem suam, to excuse this his innovation, presumption and contempt against the Emperors Prerogative Royal, munera & excusatoriam Epistolam misit, sibi non solum nolenti, sed etiam plurimum poe∣nitenti Pontificatus honorem impactum asseverans. Missaratum, alia legatione pactum quod cum praedecessoribus suis factum fuerat, & secum fieri & firmari rogavit (to wit, concerning the election of Popes by the Emperors license, and in the presence of him, or his Amba∣ssadors, not otherwise, for the transgression wherof, he humbly craved the Emperors pardon, upon his repentance of, and enforcement thereunto against his will) & ea quae petierat, in petravit. The Emperor Ludovicus accepting this his submission and excuse, monet Clerum atque populum Romanum, ne in futurum Caesaream majestatem laedant, & ut majorum statuta servent in creando Ponifice, wherein they had of late no lesse then thrice transgressed. This Emperor soon after crowned Lotharius his son King of Italy, and his companion in the Empire; who passing near Rome, Pope Paschal invited him to the City, and receiving him there honourably on Easter-day, apud sanctum Petrum, & regni coronam & Imp. Augusti nomen accepit, from this Popes hands who consecrated him. After his return from Rome, the Emperor was informed that Theodorus Pincernus, & Leo per seditionem privantur oculis, & truncantur capite, quod fideliter juvarent partes Lotharii, which sedition and murther in Rome was by common fame and just suspition, imputed to Pope Paschal, as the contriver or com∣mander thereof, or at least conniverat it. Ludovicus thereupon, Legatos designat ad perscrutandam facti veritatem, viz. Adalindum Abbatem, & Humfridum Coitem Curiensem. Pope Paschal being informed of the Emperors intention, sent two De∣legats, the one a Bishop, the other an Archdeacon to the Emperor, ad se purgandum ab infamia excitatae seditionis & perpetratae caedis. Caesar autem (auditis etiam Ponti∣cis Legatis) being unsatisfied with their excuses, jubet suos Legatos Romam proficisci, ut quid sit verum percunctentur. But the businesse being so smothered at Rome, that they could not find out the truth upon examination; thereupon this Pope, coaa Synodo Episcoporum, Iurejurando se purgat, & interfectores in ea seditione absolvens, cae os reos agit laesae Majestatis, (as if they were Traytors to the Emperor) and so iure occi∣sos esse pronunciat. All clear evidences of the Emperors Supremacy over this Pope. The antient Right of Emperors and Kings to grant Licenses to elect Bishops upon Petitions of the Clergy and People, to confirm them after they were chosen Bishops, and install them in their Bishopricks, is most clearly evidenced by Printed in Predeicus Lin∣debrogus, Co∣dex Legum An∣tiquarum, p. 1205, &c. 1213, 1214. & Bibliotheca Patrum, Colo∣niae Agrip. Tom 7. p. 564, 56, 566.

De Episcepatu; conteining the usual form of Christian Kings Charters in that and former ages, for conferring of a Bishoprick, and consecrating a Bishop, when elected and approved by the King, having some me∣morable expressions, evidencing the supream care of the Church and Peoples souls to belong to Kings, who are to provide able godly Bishops under them, diligently to preach to the Peoples, as well as govern them, and to pray for Kings prosperity.

Chapters, concerning Abbots, Abbesses, Monks, Nuns, Metropolitans, Bishops, Priests, all sorts of Ecclesiastical persons, affairs, duties, vices, crimes, and their respective punishments: to which he prefixed this Preface; Quia Scriptura testatur, Quodcunque possumus, instanter operari debemus quia nulli ad bene operandum crastinus dies permittitur: Omnesque, secundum Aposto∣lum, ante Tribunal Christi stabimus, ut unusquisque rationem pro his, quae gessit, reddat; Nobis praecipue, (qui caeteris mortalibus conditione aequales existimus, & dignitate tantum superiores sumus, secundum Scripturam sacram, quae dicit; Quoniam interrogabt opera nostra et cogitationes scrutabitur, rationes reddituri su∣mus) sollicita circumspectione, totaque mentis intentione sata∣gendum est, ut bonis operibus jugiter insistendo, his quibus prae∣esse videmur, modis omnibus, quantum nobis divina suffragante misericordia facultas adtributa fuerit, prodesse curemus. Sed quia omne datum optimum, et omne donum perfectum desursum est, debemus continuis Precibus dominum humiliter exorare, faciemque illius humili confessione et con∣grua, prout ipse posse dederit, emendatione praevenire: ut sicut ejus est muneris quod regnamus, ejus sit pietatis quod foeliciter regnamus. Quatenus eo miserante, & regni gubernacula aequissimo libramine tenere, & ad eum qui Rex Regum est, et Dominus Dominantium, cum multiplici fructu administrationis nostrae, justitiae scilicet, & pietate atque humilitate, sine fine cum eo regnaturi mereamur pervenire. Et quoniam per Apostolum suum nos adjutores suos appellare dig∣natus est: et Sancta Ecclesia, ejus videlicet sponsa, in Scriptu∣ris sacris hortus est appellata, quotidianis exercitiis adhibito sarculo bonae opera∣tionis est excolenda. Ut sicut semper nociva in ea velut in bono agro emergunt: ita semper laboris boni studio eradicentur noxia, plantentur utilia. Oportet et Nos cunctis ejus necessitatibus nisibus quibus possumus devote consulere: quatenus in ejus emendatione, quantum Dominus pos∣se dederit, tota cum mentis devotione elaborantes, in aliqua parte aedificiorum illius, a fabricatore ejus, Domino scilicet Iesu Christo, aptari mereamur. Proinde notum sit omnibus fidelibus Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae nostrisque Domino dispensante successoribus, quia cum nos nullis existentibus meritis, divina pietas genitore nostro a rebus hu∣manis exempto, ad ejus Imperii culmen provexisset, quomodo aut qualiter desiderium divini cultus, quod ab ineunte aetate Christo in∣spirante, mente conceperam, ad effectum Domino suffragante perdu∣ceremus, et quid studii, quidve laboris progenitores nostri, praecipue tamen piae recordationis genitor, in utilitatibus sanctae Dei Eccle∣siae exhibuerit adverteremus, et pia illorum facta non solum invio∣lata conservare, sed etiam imitari, pro viribus nobis a Domino concessis optaremus. Scilicet, ut sive in Ecclesiasticis negotiis, sive in statu Reipublicae emendatione dignum prospexissemus, quan∣tum Dominus posse dabat, nostro studio emendaretur. Et hactenus hinc inde mundanorum turbinum procellis emergentibus, diversissimisque occupationibus in∣gruentibus praepediti, ut optaveramus efficere nequivissemus, ejus rei gratia 4. Anno Imperii nostri accersitis nonnullis Episcopis, Abbatibus, Canonicis, & Monachis, & fidelibus obtutibus nostris studuimus eorum consulta sagacissima investigare inquisitione, qualiter unicuique ordini, Canonicorum videlicet & Monachorum, & Laicorum, juxta quod ratio dictabat, & facultas suppetebat, Deo opem ferente consuleremus. Et quo∣niam licet saepe de statu Ecclesiarum, et de ritibus praeterito tempo∣re ordinassemus, et missos per singula loca destinassemus, sed invi∣dente Diabolo, per tyrannicam pravitatem praepeditum fuisset, oportebat ut hoc tempus paucis indultum ad communem Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae, et omnium no∣strorum utilitatem impenderemus, tribus videlicet modis, ut quae bene inchoata erant, Deo auxiliante effectum obtinerent, et si quae
bona voluntate sed incauta discretione, variis praepedientibus causis, inchoata fuissent, ut diligenter inspicerentur, et discrete, prout fa∣cultas suppetebat corrigerentur, si quae etiam de his, quae necessa∣ria erant, deesse videremus, ut quaererentur, et Deo auxiliante ad effectum perducerentur, quatenus deinceps opus nostrum a nemine juste posset reprehendi, et tam nostris quam futuris temporibus mul∣torum saluti proficeret, et Deo opitulante stabile permaneret. Sed qualiter de his divina cooperante gratia, consulta fidelium po viribus et temporis brevitate, licet non quantum debuimus & voluimus, sed quantum a Deo posse accepimus egeri∣mus, et quid unicuique ordini communi voto, communique con∣sensu consulere studuerimus, ita ut quid Canonicis proprie de his, quidve Monachis observandum, quid etiam in Legibus mundanis, quid quoque in Capitulis inferendum foret adnotaverimus, et singu∣lis singula observanda contraderemus. Tamen ut sive nostris, sive successorum nostrorum temporibus rata forent, et inviolabiliter Deo annuente conservarentur, libuit nobis ea quae gesta sunt, ob memoriae firmitatisque gratiam, in unum strictim congerere, et sub∣jectis Capitulis annotare, et in publico archivo recondere, ut suc∣cessores nostri Deo dispensante, nostra pia facta conservantes, et ip∣si nihilominus bona facta sua successoribus suis servanda perdoceant. Amongst theseAdditio. 2. cap. 23. Fridericus Lindebrogus, p. 1149. Additional Laws this is one, specially recommended to the Em∣peror by this Council, as a principal, part of his Kingly office, and duty; Quod in eligen∣dis & constituendis Pastoribus, rectoribusque in Ecclesiis Dei, Regem magnum studium at∣que solertissimam vigilantiam et curam adhibere oporteat. Quia si aliter factum fue∣rit, & ordo Ecclesiasticus suam non habebit dignitatem, & Religio Christiana in mul∣tis labefactanda damna detrimenti sui patiatur, et animae Regiae vestrae periculum generabitur. Moreover this pious Emperor, and Charles the Great, Universos quoque Veteris ac Novi Testamenti libros, librariorum imperitia, lectorum osci∣tantia, interpretum inscitia, & incuria temporum depravatos, ad amussim et veritatem fontis correxit. Extat publicumCapitulaia Caroli & Lu∣dovici, lib. 1. Tit. 20. & lib. . Tit. 227. Decretum, ut Canonici libri tantum legantur in Ec∣clesia, nec sinit in divinis Lectionibus templisque inter sacra officia, incondi∣tos solae cismos, barbarismo que inconcinnos obstrepere, in quibus quidam reli∣giosuli nostra memoria, sanctitatem collocant; asAnnalium Boiorum. lib. 4. 283, 284. Joannes Aventinus informs us. All these particulars abundantly evidence the Supremacy of Charles the Great, and Ludovicus his sonne, both as Kings and Emperors, in and over all Ecclesiasti∣cal persons, causes, and Popes themselves during their reigns, and that the care, pro∣tection, propagation of Religion, the Church, and their peoples salvation, belonged principally to, and were managed by them, as the chief branch of their Kingly office. This Emperor Ludovicus Pius collected, published sundry Ecclesiastical Lawes and Constitutions, which he thus prefaced;Capitulaia Karol. & Ludo∣vici Imperato∣ris, l. 2. c. 1. 2, 3, 4. Fredericus Lindebrogus, p. 858. Omnibus vobis aut visu aut auditu notum esse non dubitamus, quia genitor noster, & progenitores, postquam a Deo ad hoc electi sunt, in hoc praecipue studuerunt, ut honor Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae, et status Regni decens maneret. Nos etiam juxta modum nostrum eorum sequentes Exemplum, saepe vestram devotionem de his admonere curavimus, et Deo miserante, multa jam emendata et correcta vi∣demus. Vnde et Deo justas laudes persolvere, & vestrae bonae intentio∣ni multimodas, debemus gratias referre. Sed quoniam complacuit divinae providentiae no∣stram mediocritatem ad hoc constituere, ut sanctae suae Ecclesiae et regni huius curam gereremus (observe it) ad hoc certare, et nos et filios ac socios no∣stros diebus vitae nostrae optamus, ut tria specialiter Capitula, et a nobis, et a vobis, Deo opem ferente, in hujus regni administratione specialiter conserventur; id est, ut defensio et exaltatio vel honor sanctae Dei Ecclesiae, et servorum illius congruus maneat, et pax, et Iustitia in omni generalitate populi nostri conservetur. In his quippe maxime studere, et de his in omnibus placitis quae vobiscum
Deo auxiliante habituri sumus, vos admonere optamus, sicut de∣bitores sumus. Sed quanquam summa hujus ministerii in nostra perso∣na consistere videatur, tamen & divina authoritate, & humana or sinatione, ita per partes divisum esse cogoscitur. Vnde apparet, quod ego omnium vestrum admonitor esse debeo, et omnes vos nostri adiutores esse debetis. Nec enim ignoramus, quid unicuique vestrum in sibi commissa portione conveniat, & ideo praetermit∣tere non possumus quin unumquem{que} juxta suum ordinem admoneamus. Sed quoni∣am scimus, quod specialiter pertineat ad Episcopos, ut primum ad sacrum ministerium suscipiendum justè accedant, & in eodem Ministerio religiose vivant, & tam bene vivendo, quam recte praedicando populis sibi commissis, it er vitae praebeant: & ut in Mona∣steriis in suis Parochiis constitutis sancta religio observata fiat, unusquisque juxta suam professionem veraciter vivat, curam impendant. Omnes vos in hoc sacro ordine constitutos, et officio Pastorali functos, monemus atque rogamus, ut in hoc maxime elaborare studeatis, et per vosmetipsos, et per vobis subjectos, quantum ad vestrum ministerium pertinet, nobis veri adjutores in administratione ministerii nobis commissi exista∣tis, ut in judicio non condemnari pro nostra & vestra negligentia, sed potius pro u∣trorumque bono studio remunerari mereamur. Et ubicunque per negligentiam Abbatis aut Abbatissae, vel Comitis, siveSee Frideici Lindebrogi Glossarium, ti.

This pious King and Emperor employedFridericus Lindebrogus Codex Legum Antiquarum, p. 825, 826, &c. Abbot Ansegisus to collect all his own, his Fathers King Charls the Great, and other his Predecessors Ecclesiastical Lawes (made by the advice of their Nobles as well as Bishops) scattered in divers Schedules, into one Volume, and to present them to him, for the honour and good of the Church, who accordingly collected, digested them into several Books, Chapters, intituled, Capitularia Caroli Magni, & Ludovici, consisting of 7. Books, and near 1600 brief Chapters or Constitutions, besides 4. Books of Additions to them, printed all together inFrancofurt: 1613. Fridericus Lindebrogus his Codex Legum Antiquarum, where∣in are comprised all sorts of Laws, Canons, Constitutions relating to the Orthodox faith, worship, service of God, Scriptures, Sacraments, all Ecclesiastical persons, duties, mat∣ters, Christians whatsoever, to whom he prescribed these Laws, by his Royal authori∣ty, (corrected, augmented by advice of his Nobles, as the Titles to each Book declare) and sundry penalties, as having the principal care of the Church and people of God committed to him, for which trust he was to give a strict account at the day of Judgement. In his 7th. Book cap: 375, 376. he thus ratified all the precedent Lawes. Has omnes Constitutiones quas summatim breviterque perstrinximus, sicut plenius in Canone continentur, manere perenni stabilitate sancimus Si quis er∣go Clericus aut Laicus harum sanctionum obediens esse noluerit, si Clericus fuerit, excommunicationi subjaceat. Si vero Laicus fuerit, & honestioris loci persona, medietatem facultatum suarum amittat, fisci juribus profutu∣ram: si vero majoris loci persona est, amissione rerum suarum multatus, in exilio depute∣tur. Quaecunque a Parentibus nostris diversis sunt statuta temporibus, manere inv∣olata et incorrupta circa sacrosanctas Ecclesias praecipimus. Nihil igitur a privilegiis immutetur, omnibus qui Ecclesiis serviunt tuitio deferatur, Quia temporibus nostris addi potius reverentiae cupimus, quam ex his, quae olim praestituta sunt, immutari.

Yea he made this Law to prevent the tumults about elections of Popes: Volumus, ut ad electionem Pontificis nemo audeat venire, ne{que} liber, ne{que} servus qui aliquod impedimentū inferat, exceptis illis tantū Romanis quibus antiqua fuit consuetudo, per constitutionem Sanctorum Patrum, concessa eligendi Pontificem.

Dignissimae reverentiae vestrae patefecimus nos humiles simul vestri Rabanus cum Coepiscopis ejus, &c. wherein they have this notable passage touching Princes Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction. Petimus, ut sicut apud antecessores vestros Reges atque Imperatores, qui ante vos fuerunt, honorem sancta Dei Ecclesia habuit, & per immunitatem eorum possessiones Ecclesiasticae inconvulsae perstiterunt, manentesque in eis semper inlaesae perseveraverunt; ita apud vos modernis tem∣poribus incontaminatae permaneant. Zelo enum Dei oportet vos defendere Ecclesi∣as Christi, qui vobis Regnum in terra et dominationem tribuit, ut per nullius suggestiones iniquas vestram concessionem quam in Eleemosynam vestram Ecclesiis Christi contulistis, sinatis permutari. Quia inhonestum est ut hoc, quod non solum Christianis temporibus a Christianis Imperatoribus, sed etiam a Paganis regibus tempore Gentilitatis ad honorem Dei collatum est, vestris temporibus in vestro Regno permutetur: Nam legimus apudEsdr. 7. Esdram, quod Artaxerxes Rex Esdrae scribae legis Dei per Epistolam mandave∣rit, Ego Artaxerxes, &c. De Christianis vero Regibus & Imperatoribus non necesse est aliqua exempla ponere, cum omnes qui rectae fidei, et sani dogmatis fuerint, a Constantino Imperatore, (qui primus Imperatorum Christianam Religionem defendere, atque honorem Ecclesiarum Dei amplificare caepit) usque ad vos, semper in hoc studio solerter laboraverint, ut Ecclesia Dei pacem et tranquillitatem haberet, quatenus cultus Dei incontaminatus foret, et servie jus sine impedimento, Deo delectabiliter deservirent. At the end of their last Chapter they conclude with this Petition to the Emperor: Ibid. c. 31. p. 428. Haec vero quae vobis transmissa sunt, petimus, ut vestra authori∣tate firmentur. Et si quis adversarius illis existere voluerit, prae∣valere non permittatur.

Lewes and Lotharius commanded a general Fast to be kept throughout their Realms,Anno 829. to divert Gods warth and judgements, and likewise summoned 4. Councils, at Paris, Mentz, Lyons, and Tholose, to reform both in the Clergy and Laity, Church and State, all sins, vices, errors, corruptions, contrary to Gods word, which had brought plagues, wars, and other judgements on them, to appease Gods wrath against them and their Subjects. Et quia nos magis in hoc peccasse cognoscimus, qua forma salutis omnibus esse de∣buimus, et omnium curam gerere, et per authoritatem Imperialem pravorum acta ne tantum adcrescerent, corrigere cupimus, (write these Emperors in their summons of, and pious prologue to the Council of Paris) where∣fore, totius Ecclesiae sibi commissae (mark it) generalitati consulere gestientes. they summoned these Councils to assist them in this their general desired reformati∣on.
Consultu Episcoporum, Sacerdotum & Optimatum caeterorum{que} fidelium nostro∣rum. Whereupon the Bishops and others assembled in the Council of Paris, Ortho∣doxorum Principum jussionibus obedientes, compiled several Constitutions and Rules for the reformation of themselves and other Christians, which they digested into three Bookes. The first, for the reformation of the corruptions, lives of Bishops, Priests, Monks, abuses in Gods worship, and prophanations of the Lords day. The 2d. de∣scribing the respective duties, and regulating the enormities of Kings, Civil Magi∣strates, Officers, and sinnes of the people, in relation to Gods worship and service. The 3d. relating both to Kings, Bishops, Priests and people. In the 2d. Book they thus describe the office and duty of a King, Cap. 1. Quid sit Rex, quid esse, quidque cavere debet.Surius Con∣cil. Tom. 3 p 389, to 393. Centur, Magd. 9. c. 9. Rex a recte agendo vocatur. Si enim piè, & justè, & misericorditer regit, merito, Rex appellatur: si his caruerit, non Rex, sed Ty∣rannus est, &c. Quia ergo Rex a regendo dicitur, primò ei studendum est, ut semet ip∣sum suamque domum, Christi adjuvante gratiâ, ab operibus nequam emaculet, bonisque operibus exuberare faciat, ut ab ea caeteri subjecti bonum exemplum semper capiant; ipse etiam salutiferis Christi praeceptis fideliter atque obedienter obsecundet, & recte agendo eis quibus temporaliter imperat, in pace & concordia atque charitate caeterorum{que} bonorum operum exhibitione, quantum sibi divinitus datur, consistere faciat, et dictis atque ex∣emplis ad opus pietatis et justitiae, et misericordiae solerter excitet, attendens, quod pro his Deo rationem redditurus sit, quatenus ita agendo sanctorum Regum, qui Deo syncere serviendo, placuerunt, post hane peregrinationem consors efficiatur. De Rege autem qualis esse, vel quid cavere debeat,Deut. 17. ita in Deuteronomo legitur, Cum ingressus fueris terram, quam Dominus Deus tuus dabit tibi, & possederis eam, habitaverisque in illa. et dixeris, Constituam super me Regem, sicut habent omnes per circuitum Nationes: eum con∣stitues, quem Dominus Deus tuus elegerit de numero fratrum tuorum. Et post pau∣ca. Non habebit Uxores plurimas quae alliciant animum ejus, neque Argenti & Auri immensa pondera. Postquam autem sederit in solio regni sui, describat sibi Deuteronomium legis hujus in volumine, accipiens exemplar a Sacerdotibus Leviti∣cae tribus, & habebit secum, legetque illud omnibus diebus vitae suae, ut discat time∣re Dominum Deum suum, & custodire verba, & Ceremonias ejus, quae lege prae∣cepta sunt: nec extolletur cor ejus in superbiam super fratres suos, neque declinet in partem dextram vel sinistram, ut longo tempore regnet ipse & filii ejus super Israel. Attende quod timor Dei & custodia praeceptorum ejus, & humilitas, quae non patitur eum extolli super fratres suos, & Justitiae rectitudo non solum Regem, sed & fi∣lios ejus longo faciet regnare tempore, Ut ergo Princeps extollentiam cavere debeat: Eccle∣siasticus admonens ait,Eccles. 32. Principem te constituerunt? noli extolli, sed esto in illis, quasi unus ex ipsis.Prov. 29. In Proverbiis, Rex qui Judicat in veritate pauperes, Thronus ejus in aeternum firmabitur.Prov. 20. Item, Misericordia & veritas custodiunt Regem, & ro∣boratur Clementia Thronus ejus. Quantae igitur foelicitatis sit bonus Rex, quantaeve infoelicitatis si nequam fuerit; Beatus Cyprianus, eximius Martyr Christi, de Duo∣decim abusionibus; Scribens, inter caetera ita ait, Nonus inquiens, abusionis gradus est, Rex iniquus; etenim Regem non iniquum, sed correctorem iniquorum esse o∣portet. Unde in semetipso nominis sui dignitatem custodire debet. Nomen enim Regis intellectualiter hoc retinet, ut subjectis omnibus rectoris officium procuret: sed qualiter a∣lios corrigere poterit, qui proprios mores, ne iniquisint, non corrigat? Quoniam Ju∣stitia Regis exaltatur solium, & veritate solidantur gubernacula populorum, Justitia ve∣ro Regis est, neminem injuste per potentiam opprimere, sine acceptione personarum inter virum & proximum suum judicare: advenis & pupillis & viduis defensorem esse: fur∣ta cohibere, adulteria punire, iniquos non exaltare, impudicos & histriones non nutrire, impios de terra perdere, parricid is & pejcrantes vivere non sinere, Ecclesias defendere, paupres eleemosynis alere, justos super regni negotia constituere, senes & sapientes & so∣brios Consiliarios habere. Magorum & hariolorum Pythonissarumque super stitionibus non intendere, iracundiam differre, patriam & fortiter & juste contra adversarios defen∣dere, per omnia in Deo vivere, prosperitatibus non elevare animum, cuncta adversa pa∣enter ferre, fidem Catholicam in Deum habere, filios suos non sinere impie a∣gere, Eccles. 10. certis horis orationibus insistere: ante horas congruas non gustare cibum: Vae e∣nim terrae, cujus Rex est puer, & cujus Principes mane comedunt.

vero secundum hanc Legem non dissensat, multas nimirum adversitates imperii tolerat. enim saepe pax populorum rumpitur, & offendicula etiam de regno suscitantur, ter∣rarum quoque fructus diminuuntur, & servitia populorum praepediuntur; multi etiam do∣lores prosperitatem regni inficiunt, harorum & liberorum mortes tristitiam conferunt, hosti∣um incursus provincias undi{que} vastant, bestiae armentorum & pecorum greges dilacerant, tempestates veris & hyemis terrrum foecunditatem, & maris Ministeria prohibent, & aliquando fulminum ictus segetes, & arborum stores, & pampinos exurunt. Super omnia vero Regis injustitia non solum praesentis Imperii faciem fuscat, sed etiam filios suos & nepotes, ne post se regni haereditatem teneant, Reg. 12. obscurat. Propter piaculum enim Solomo∣nis regnum domus, Israel Dominus de manibus filiorum ejus dispersit, & propter me∣ritum David Regis, lucernam de semine ejus semper in Hierusalem reliquit. Ecce quantum justitia Regis seculo valet, intuentibus perspicue patet; Pax populorum est, tu∣tamentum patriae, immunitas plebis, munimentum gentis, cura larguorum, gaudium ho∣minum, temperies atris, serenias maris, terrae foecunditas, solatium pauperum, haereditas filiorum, & sibimetipsi futurae beatitudinis. Attamen sciat, quod sicut in Thro∣no hominum primus constitutus est, sic et in poenis, si Iustitiam non fecerit, primatum habiturus est. Omnes namque quoscunque peccatores sub se in praesenti ha∣buit, supra se modo in illa futura poena habebit. (After which they insert theHere, p. 126, 127. forecited passage of Fulgentius in Libro de veritate Praedestinationis & Gratiae.)Lib. . Senten∣tiarum cap. 49. Isiodorus, Qui recte utitur regni potestate, ita praestare se omnibus debet, ut quanto magis honoris celsitudine claret, tanto semetipsum mente humiliet. Proponens sibi exemplum humi∣litatis David, qui de suis meritis non tumuit, sed humiliter sese dejiciens, dixit; Vilis incedam,2 Reg. 6. & vilis apparebo ante Dominum qui elegit me. Item Isidorus. Qui intra seculum bene temporaliter imperat,Ibidem. c. 48. sine fine in perpetuum regnat, & de Gloria se∣culi hujus ad a ternam transmeat gloriam: qui vero prave regnum exercent, post ve∣stem fulgentem & lumina lapillorum, nudi & miseri ad inferna torquendi descendunt. Reges a recte agendo vocati sunt, ideoque sicut recte agendo, Regis nomen tenetur, ita peccan∣do amittitur. Nam & viros sanctos proinde Reges vocari in sacris eloquiis, eo quod recte agant, sensusque proprios bene regant, & motus resistentes sibi rationabili discretione componant. Recte igitur illi Reges vocantur, qui tam semetipsos, quam subjectos bene re∣gendo modificare noverunt. Quidam ipsum nomen regiminis ad immanitatem transver∣tunt crudelitatis; dumque ad culmen potestatis venerint, in Apostasiam confestim labun∣tur: tantoque se tumore cordis extollunt, ut cunctos subditos in sui comparatione despici∣ant, cosque quibus praeesse contigit, non agnoscant. Et paulo post. Dum mundi Reges blimiores se caeteris sentiunt, mortales tamen se esse agnoscant, nec regni Glori∣am, qua in seculo sublimantur, adspiciant: sed opus quod secum deportant, intendant Item non post multa. Reges quando boni sunt, muneris esse Dei, quando vero mali, sceleris esse populi. Secundum meritum enim plebium, disponitur vita rectorum, te∣stante Job:Job 34 Qui regnare facit hypocritam propter peccata populi. Irascente enim Deo, talem Rectorem populi suscipiunt qualem pro peccato merentur. Nonnun∣quam pro malitia plebis, etiam Reges mutantur, & qui ante videbantur esse boni, ac∣cepto regno siunt iniqui. His ita praemissis, studendum est Regi, ut non solum in se, verum etiam in sibi subjectis Regis nomen adimpleat: provide∣atque ut populus sibi subjectus, pietate, pace, charitate, justitia et misericordia, atque concordia, et unanimitate, ceterisque bonis exu∣beret operibus, ut haec habentes, Dominum secum habere mereantur; sciat{que} certissime, quod non solum de se, verum etiam de ipsis Domi∣nus ab eo fructum bonae operationis exacturus est. After which they thus proceed, Cap. 2. Quid sit propriè Ministerium Regis? Regale Ministerium spe∣cialiter est populum Dei gubernare et regere cum aequalitate et ju∣stitia, et ut pacem et concordiam habeant, studere: ipse enim debet primo Defensor esse Ecclesiarum et servorum Dei, viduarum, or∣phanorum, caeterorumque pauperum, necnon et omnium indigenti∣um. Ipsius enim terror & studium hujuscemodi in quantum possibile est, esse debet pri∣mò, ut nulla injusticia fiat; deinde, si evenerit, ut nullo modo ea subsistere permittat, nec spem delitescendi, sive audaciam malè agendi cuiquam relinquat, sed sciant omnes, quoniam si ad ipsius notitiam pervenerit quippiam mali quod admiserint, nequaquam incorrectum & ultum remanebit, sed juxta sacti qualitatem, erit & modus justae correptionis. Qua∣propter
in Throno regiminis positus est,2 Par. 19 ad judicia recta peragenda, ut ipse per se provideat, & perquirat, ne in judicio aliquis a veritate & aequitate declinet: Scire eti∣am debet, quod causa quam juxta ministerium sibi commissum administrat, non homi∣num, sed Dei causa existit, cui pro Ministerio quod suscepit, in examinis tre∣mendi die rationem redditurus est. Et ideo oportet, ut ipse qui Judex est Judicum, causam pauperum ad se ingredifaciat & diligenter inquirat, ne forte illi, qui ab eo con∣stituti sunt, & vicem eius agere debent in populo, injuste aut negligenter pauperis op∣pressiones pati permittant.Job 29. De Ministerio autem Regis ita Job loquitur; Cum sederem quasi Rex circunstante exercitu, eram tamen maerentium Consolator. Auris audi∣ens beatificabat me, & oculus videns testimonium reddebat mihi, quod liberassem pauperem vociferantem, & pupillam cui non esset adjutor. Benedictio perituri super me veniebat, & cor viduae consolatus sum: Justitia indutus sum, & vestivi me sicut vestimento & Diademate judicio meo: Oculus fui caeco, & pes claudo: Pater eram pauperum, & causam quam nesciebam diligentissime investigabam: conterebam molas iniqui,Prov. 20. & de dentibus illius auferebam praedam. Solomon: Rex qui sedet in solio judicu dissipat omne malum intuitu suo.Eccl. 10. Item,Prov: 29. Dissipat impios Rex sapiens, & curvat super eos fornicem. Item, Judex sapiens vindicabit populum suum, & prin∣cipatus sensati stabilis est. Item, Rex Justus erigit terram, & vir avarus destruit eam.Sap. . In Libro Sapientiae. Diligite Justitiam, qui iudicatis terram, sentite de Domino in bonitate, & simplicitate cordis quaerite illum. Item ibi. Audite ergo Reges & intelligite, discite Judices finium terrae; praebete aures vos qui continetis multitu∣dines & placetis vobis in turbis Nationum, quoniam data est a Domino vobis pote∣stas & virtus ab altissimo, qui interrogabit opera vestra, & cogitationes scrutabitur; quoniam cum essetis Ministeri ejus, non recte judicastis, neque custodistis legem Justi∣tiae, neque secundum Dei voluntatem ambulastis; Horrende & cito apparebit vobis, quoniam judicium durissimum in his qui praesunt, fiet; Exiguo enim conceditur mise∣ricordia: Potentes autem potenter tormenta patientur: Non enim subtrahet per∣sonam cujusquam Dominus; nec reverebitur cujusquam magnitudinem: quoniam pusillum & magnum ipse fecit, et aequaliter pro omnibus cura est illi. Tortioribus autem fortior instat cruciatus.See here, p 152. Isiodorus. Principes seculi nonnunquam intra Eccle∣siam potestatis adeptae culmina tenent, ut per eandem potestatem disciplinam Eccle∣siasticam muniant. Caeterum intra Ecclesiam potestates necessariae non essent, nisi ut quod non praevalet Sacerdos efficere per Doctrinae sermonem, potestas hoc im∣peret per disciplinae terrorem. Saepe per regnum terrenum, Coeleste regnum profi∣cit, ut qui intra Ecclesiam positi contra fidem et disclplinam Ecclesiae agunt, rigore principum conterantur ipsamque disciplinam quam EcclesiaeHumilitas. utilitas exercere non praevalet, cervicibus superborum potestas principalis imponat: et ut venerationem mereatur virtutem potestas impertiat. Cognoscant Principes seculi Deo debere se reddere rationem propter Ecclesiam, quam a Christo tuendam susci∣piunt. Nam sive augeatur pax, & disciplina Ecclesiae per fideles Principes, sive solva∣tur, ille ab eis rationem exiget, qui eorum potestati suam Ecclesiam credidit. Sunt & alia utriusque testamenti cracula copiosa, quibus affatim adstraitur, quod Rex Ministerium sibi commissum secundum voluntatem Dei exercere & adimplere debet, quae hic ob prolixitatem vitandum praetermittuntur. Cap. 3. De periculo Regis, & quod bene agentes remunerare, & malè vero agntes suae Authoritate comprimere, causam{que} pauperum ad se ingredi debeat facere. And Cap. 4. Quod aequitas Judicii, stabilimentum Regni, & ejus injustitia, sit ejus eversio: are worthy perusal to these purposes, but overtedious to insert; I shall only recite some passages of Cap. 5. Quod regnum non ab hominibus; sed a Deo, in cujus manu omnia regna consistunt, dtur. Nemo regum a progenitoribus reg∣num sibi administrari, sed a Deo veraciter atque humiliter credere debet dari, &c. which they prove by Prov. 8. 14, 15, 16. Dan. 4. 25. Dan. 5. 21. Jer. 27. 4, 5, 6. Hosea 8. 4. Job 34. 30. Isiodorus exponit, Irascente Deo, talem rectorem populi sus∣cipiunt, qualem pro peccato merentur. Constat ergo quia non actu, non voto, neque bra∣chio fortitudinis humanae, sed virtute, imo occulto Judicio dispensationis divinae regnum con∣fertur terrenum. Et idcirco cuicunque ab eo committitur, ita illud secundum ejus voluntatem disponere et gubernare procuret, quate∣nus cum eo, a quo illud suscepit, feliciter, in perpetuum regnare vale∣at; quoniam nihil prodest cuipiam terreno regno principari, si (quod absit) contigerit eum aeterno extortem fieri. After which description of a
Kings office and duty, they thus humbly submit all their Constitutions and Resolves in this Council to the Emperors wills, and desire their confirmation of them so farr as they should think expedient, as these passages evidence;Surius, Tom. 3. p. 402, 415. Nos fidelissimi ac de∣votissimi salutis vestrae procuratores, juxta parvitatem sensus nostri, prout brevitas tem∣poris permisit, secundum sanctam devotionem et ordinationem vestram, de causis ad religionem Christianam, nostrumque ministerium atque pe∣riculum pertinentibus; necnon et de his quae ad nostram correctio∣nem et emendationem pertinere perspeximus; sive de his, quae populis generaliter annuncianda, & admonenda praevidimus, capitulatim in praecedentibus adnota∣vimus libellis, vestraeque Serenitati legenda, immo probanda obtulimus, &c. Et quanquam de his quae praemissa sunt, vestro ardentissimo desiderio prius satisfacere ele∣gerimus, nequaquam tamen haec quae specialiter ad vestram personam ministerium{que} pertinere cognovimus, oblivioni tradimus, sed potius vestrae saluti prospicientes, nonnulla capitula necessaria, in secundo hujus operis libello, ad nomen ministeriumque vestrum pertinentia, periculumque cavendum, solerti studio con∣gessimus, & vobis familiaritr admonitionis gratia, porrigenda devovimus; ut ea diligen∣ter inspiciendo, legendo & audiendo, aperte & distincte Vestra cognoscat Celsitudo, de qui∣bus, & pro quibus,Ibidem, pag. 405, 406, 407, 408. in memoratis conventibus nostris, secundum virium nostrarum possibilita∣tem fideliter salubrier{que} egerimus.

And they conclude thus, Ibid. p. 409, 420. Lib. 3. Cap. 27. Porro de Episcopali libertate, quam Deo annuente, vestroque admi∣niculo suffragante adipiscivd Dei servitium peragendum cupimus, suo in tempore vobis di∣cenda at{que} vobiscum conferenda reservavimus. Bibliotheca Pa∣trum, Tom. 9. pas 1. p. 553. Agobardus Episcopus Lugdunensis,Anno 830. begins his refutation of the heretical position of the deposed Felicis Orgellitani Episcopi, (dedicated to Ludovicus Pius the Emperor) with this Prologue; Christianorum religiosissimo, Christi amatori, ideo{que} victori ac triumphatori piissimo, Augusto, Domino gloriosissimo Ludovico Imperatori. Pie igitur, & Domine Rector, CAPUT ORBIS, decus mundi, Catholicorum omnium in∣signis gloriatio, qui illustratis fidem, Propagatis et pacem. Obsecro mansue∣tudinem vestram, ut in contemplationem Filii Dei, qui vestrum juvat imperium, praefatum Opusculum perlustrare non dedignemini, ut vestro acerrimo judicio probetur, aut im∣probetur: quia si probatur, illis quibus profuturum est, ad legendum commendatur: si autem improbatur, auctor eius per vos emendatur. If this learned Bishop thus wholly submitted his Treatise concerning one of the highest points of Faith (to wit, the Unity of the two Natures of Christ in one person) to this Emperors ap∣probation, correction, or rejection, and gave him these Titles, no doubt he estee∣med him the supreamest Judge thereof. Moreover, he dedicated to him his Trea∣tises Ibid: p. 562, 563, 564. De insolentia Judaeorum, & De Judaicis superstitionibus, Quem Deus omni∣potens, & praeordinavit Rectorem pium (Ecclesiae suae) futurum temporibus val∣de necessariis, sublimaverit prudentiam vestram, & studium Religionis super caete∣ros vestri temporis mortales; (whether Popes or Bishops) unde dubium non est praeparari vos ad remedium temporibus periculosis. Cum haec igitur ita se habeant, obsecro tranquillissimam longanimitatem vestram, ut praebeatis patientissmam aurem vestram, vicibus quibus ego infimus servorum vestrorum, minus necessarium puto esse admonendam

He wrote two Treasuses to this Emperor,Ibid. p. 571. 572. 604. Contra damnabilem opinionem putantium, Divini Judicii veritatem, igne, vel aqua, vel conflictu armorum patefieri; desiring him to take away such trials, as un∣just, unreasonable, unchristian, and against the word of God.

France about the year 833,Anno 833 with an inten∣tion (as Ludovicus suspected) to raise up a Civil Warr, and joyn with Lotharius his sonne (conioyned with him in the Empire) to deprive him; this Emperor summon∣ed Agobardus, amongst other Bishops siding with Lotharius, to appear before him; who refusing to appear, thereupon the Emperor called an Assembly of such French Bishops as sided with him against Agobardus,Bibl. Patr. Tom 9. pars 1 p. 512. Cujus haec fuerunt capita adversum ip∣sius contumaciam, pro cofiro ado Gallicana libertate. 1. Episcopum Romanum vocandum Papam, Fratrem, non autem Patrem, neque Pontifi∣cem. 2. Imperialem potestatem plus posse in administranda Ec∣clesia quam Pontificem. 3.

Privandum Episcopum consortio et honore, qui potius Pontificis quam Ecclesiae Gallicanae Concilio obediret. In answer whereunto, Agobardus writ two particular Treati∣ses, wherein he endeavoured, as far as he could, to answer these particulars, excu∣sing his not appearing, by reason of the publike tumults, and to diminish the Empe∣rors Supremacy, as subordinate in some sence, to the Pontifical Jurisdiction; which Treatises he dedicated and sent to the Emperor. In his TreatiseBibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 9. p. 616. De Compratione utriusque Regiminis, Ecclesiastici & Politici, & in quibus Ecclesiastica dignitas praeful∣geat Imperiorum Majestati, though he maintains the Popes Supremacy in some re∣spects; yet he expresly resolves; Certe clementissime Domiae, si nunc Gregorius Papa irrationabiliter, & ad pugnandum venit, merito et pugnatus, et repulsus recedet; si autem pro quiete & pace populi & vestra laborare nicitur, benè & rationablater obtem∣perandum est, illi non repugnandum. Si enim quod vestra voluntate, et po∣testate, cum consensu Imperii vestri factum est, & postea in Apostolica se∣de roboratum, hoc vult in pristinum reducere statum, satis rationabilis & oportunus est ejus adventus. Quia nullatenus quod ita est constitutum a vobis, de∣betis mutare; nec enim sine gravi periculo, et reatu animae fieri po∣test in his sacratissimis diebus Paschalibus. He concludes thus, Quia nemo dubitat de nullo alio opere potestatis, tam chare Deum placare, quam de sollicitu∣dine et administratione Pacis et unitatis Ecclesiae, vestra solertissi∣ma Religio elaboret, ut omnis anima fidelis proficeat in fide et cog∣nitione Dei, quae res omnibus rebus Deo chaor est, hujus rei nisus merita vestra ap∣propinquare faciat Apostolicis meritis.

Ne Lai∣ci de Clericorum vita judicent, Pontificem nec solvi, nec ligari posse decernit a seculari po∣testate; quem constat a pio Principe Constantino DEUM appellatum, cum nec posse DEUM ab hominibus judicari manifestum est. When as this Pope and other Parasites who make use of his reason, had quite forgotten, 1. That it appears not by any authen∣tick Historyes, that Constantine the Great ever gave the Title of God, to the Pope 2ly. Admit he gave it to one Pope out of the contemplation of his piety, and the spirit of God dwelling in him, yet this extended not to his Successors, especially to such who were devils incarnate in their actions. 3ly. That the Scripture never called the Pope, nor St. Peter, God; much lesse made either of them a God in truth: but it particularly, frequently stiles Kings, and Temporal Judges (Gods Vicegerents on earth, 2 Chron: 9. 8. 2 Chron: 19 6, 7. Prov: 8 15. Psal: 88. 1. sitting in his throne, executing Judgement and Justice in his stead) Gods; to wit, in a qualfyed sence, not in reality and essence. Exod. 4. 16. c. 7. 1. c. 22. 28. Josh. 22. 22. Ps. 82. 1, 6. Ps. 136. 2. Ps. 138. 1. 1 Cor. 8. 5. Therefore they being thus frequently called Gods by God himself in sacred Writ; may lawfully judge, condemn, depose Popes and Priests, who are but men, and never stiled Gods in Scripture. 4ly. Kings being thus stiled Gods, and sitting on Gods Throne, the Pope who is but a man, and sits only in St. Peters chair at most, not Gods own throne; hath not the least power or pretext (by this Popes own argument, inference) to judge, much lesse depose, dethrone these Gods, as they have mostJohn Squire, Exposit. on 2 Thess. 2. v. 3, 4. Sermon 8. antichristianly presumed. 5ly. Sundry Emperors, Kings notwithstanding this stile of God given to the Pope by Constantine, didSee Centur. Magd. 5. to 13 cap. 7, 9, 10. p. 329, 330. frequently before and after Pope Nicholas his time both judge & depose Popes, Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Bishops, Priests, for their Heresies, Treasons, Schisms, rebellions, and other crimes, as the premised and subsequent examples and Eccle∣siastical Histories evidence. This therefore is a nonsense argument for a Pope, espe∣cially in his own case, to exempt himself from the Emperors Supreme Jurisdiction. 6ly. His exempting all inferiour Clergymen, as well as Bishops, Popes from Empe∣rors, Kings, and Civil Magistrates censures, powers, though Constantine never stiled them Gods, is an argument, that every Priest whatever, is as much a God, as the Pope himself in this respect, and equal to him in Authority; which subverts Popes pretended Soveraign Monarchy, and sole Deity, appropriated only to those who sit in Peters imaginary, butJohn Squire on 2 Thess. 2. v. 3, 4.

This Pope presumed to send this insolent Letter to this Emperour Lotharius, to de∣prive him of his antient Right of conferring Archbishopricks and Bishopricks, without the Popes consent, which his Predecessors durst not attempt, prefaced by Distinctio 63 Gratian with this Rubrick; Authoritate Apostolica, non Regio favore, Episcopus est eligendus: Porro scias quod relatum est nobis, quod quicunque ad Episcopatum in reg∣no tuo provehendus est, non nisiFort fecit eos jurare e fi∣delitatem, quod Clerici non debent facere Laco, Can: 22 qu: 5 Glossa faventem tibi permittas eligi.

After the Emperors approbation of his Election by his Letters sent to Rome, he was consecrated and installed Pope, not before.

Pierre Pythou Prevues des Li∣ertez de Leg∣lise Gallicane, c. 15, 17. who for his Treason against the Empe∣ror Ludovicus Pius, to deprive him of the Empire, and thrust him into a Monastery, was deprived of his Archbishoprick, upon the Emperors complaint against him in Synodo apud Theodonis Villam, but after Ludovicus his death, restored to it by Lotha∣rius, with whom he confederated) the Kings of France having an antient Right and Prerogative annexed to their Crowns, to conferre all Archbishopricks and Bisho∣pricks within their Realms, to grant Licenses to elect them to the Clergy and people, and to approve or reject them when elected, as Archbishop Hincmarus informs us, in his Epistola ad Carolum Regem, pro Sylvanectensi Ecclesia Pastore vidnata: in his Epistola ad Clerum & plebem Beluacensis Ecclesiae: & Epistola ad Hludovicum 3. Francorum Regem, pro electione Episcopi Beluacensis, and Pierre Pythou manifestly proves by many evidences; as likewise toPierre Pythou Ibid. p. 68, 69, &c. 262, 265, 302, to 310, 319, 329, 330, 331, 346, 347, 348, 349, 792, 1296, 1297. deprive, imprison, banish, execute Bishops persons, and confiscate their Estates for Treason and other crimes, against their Oathes of Fealty and Homage to them, being the Kings Lieges and Vassals, as Pythou proves at large. This Archbishop Hincmarus in his Epistola 1. ad Ludovicum Balbum Regem, c. 9. resolves thus:Bibl. Patrum Tom. 9. pars 2. p. 43, 44, 45, 46, &c. Sollicite unicutque ambulandum est cum Deo suo, et Regi praecipue, qui sub tantis erit poenis in futuro saeculo, si malus fuerit, super quantos fuit in isto saeculo, in quo se a malitia non cor∣rexit, et non fecit judicium et justitiam, et non ambulavit sollicite cum Deo suo. And in his Epistola 2. ad Carolum Crassum Imperatorem, he exhorts and intreats him: Vt Ecclesiam Gallicanam pene collapsam restituatis, vestrique sapienti consilio, et potestatis auxilio relevetis, &c. Then shewing him the means to effect it, he concludes: Si enim Domine mi Rex, hujus Regni Ecclesia, et ministri ejus, ac populus haec per vos ob∣tinuerint, quantam mercedem et remunerationem inde apud Deum, et bonum nomen apud saeculum habebitis, ex verbis Apostoli pensare potestis, Jam. 5. 20. Si ergo Apostolus spiritu Dei plenus de uno peccatore converso tantam remunerationem praemittit, colligat sapi∣entia vestra, quantam de tantorum salute ac profectu remuneratio∣nem apud Deum habebitis. Epistola 3. & 4. he prescribes many excellent rules, pro recta novi & juvenis Regis institutione, making the care and defence of Reli∣gion, and the Church, the suppression of all heresies and sins, the principal part of a Kings Office; observing, that2 Par. 23. in sacra Regum historia legimus, quia Principes Sacerdotum quando sacra unctione Reges in Regnum sacrabant, Coronam, significantem victoriam, ponentes super capita eorum, legem in manum eorum debant, ut scirent, qualiter se∣ipses regere, et pravos corrigere, et bonos in viam rectam deberent diri∣gere, &c.

Charles and others denyed the matter, fact wherewith he was charged, as false, averring the quite contrary for verity: That, nec legali nec regulari judicio convictus apparerent: Nos vero querquam (though the meanest Peasant) à communione prohibere non possumus, quinimo haec prohi∣bitio non sit mortalis, sed medicinalis, nisi aut sponte consessum, aut aliquo, sive saeculari, sive Ecclesiastico judicio nominatum aut convictum; much less then could he excommunicate his King, it being contrary to the Canons of the Council of Africk, where St. Angu∣stine was present; yea to the very Laws, Canons, Decrees of the See Apostolick, and Popes themselves, there cited by him: That the Nobles and French Bishops, to whom he had shewed his Letter, affirmed, That Popes did not excommunicate K. Astulphus, or Desiderius King of the Lombards, who invaded their possessions in Italy: Neither did this Kings Grandfather Pipin, nor Father K. Charles, conquer them, & restore the Pope & Church to their Right, Excommunicatione Apostolica, sed virtute hostili: Dicunt etiam, secularem scripturam dicere, quia omne Regnum saeculi hujus bellis quaeritur, victoriis propagatur, & non Apostolici vel Episcoporum excommunicationibus obtinetur: & Scriptu∣ram divinam proponunt dicere,Prov. 8. 15. Quia Domini est Regnum,Dan. 2. 2. c. 4. 17, 25. c. 5. 18, 19. per quem Reges regnant, & cui voluerit dat illud, ministerio Angelorum & hominum, (not of Popes) &c. Sicut vo∣lumus de vestris orationibus habere adjutorium, nolite quaere nostrum disiendium; & petite Dominum Apostolicum, ut quia Rex et Episcopus simul esse non potest, & sui an∣tecessores Ecclesiasticum ordinem, quod suum eu, et non Rempublicam, quod Regum est, disposuerunt; non praecipiat nobis habere Regem, qui nos in sic lognquis par∣tibus adjuvare non possit contra subitanto; et frequentes Paganorum impetus et nos Francos non jubeat servire, cui nolumus servire: quia istud jugum sui anteces∣sores nostris antecessoribus non imposuerunt: et nos illud portare non possumus, qui scriptum esse in sanctis libris audimus, ut pro libertate et haereditate nostra us{que} ad mortem certare debeamus, &c. Non con∣venit ulli Episcopo dicere, ut Christianum, qui non est incorrigibilis, non propter propria crimina, sed pro terreno Regno alicui tollendo vel acquirendo, nomine Christianitatis debeat privare, cum cum dia∣bolo collocare, quem Christus sua morte, & suo sanguine de potestate Diaboli venit redi∣mere, & Christianos pro fratribus suis anias suas docuit ponere. Propterea si Dominus. Apostolicus vult pacem quaerer, sic pacem quaerat, ut rixam non moveat: quia non nos concredemus, ut aliter ad Regnum Dei pervenre non possimus, si illum, quem ipse commendat, terrenum Regem non habuerimus. After which rendring many substantial reasons why he neither could nor ought to obey his command in excommunicating K. Charles, or withdrawing himself from all communion with him, upon his Papal command, he subjoyns, Consulendum qualiter nos Episcopi, & egopraecipue, in quem tantam comminationem intentastis, erga Regem no∣strum gerere debeamus; cum beatus Augustinus, Apostoli exponens sententiam, dicat: Apostolica dominatio,Rom. 13. et omnis anima sublimioribus potestatibus subdita sit,1 Pet. 2. &c. Et beatus Petrus dicit: Subjecti estote omni humanae creaturae propter Dominum, sive Regi, quasi praecellenti, &c. Omni humanae creaturae, inquit Doctor sagacissin us, omni dignitati hominum, omni personae, omni principatui, cui vos divina dispositio subdi voluerit. Hoc est enim quod ait: Propter Dominum, quia non est potestas, nisi a Deo: & qui potestati resistir, Dei ordinationi resistit. Item S. Augustinus Sermone Evangelii Johannis, &c. Noli dicere, quid mihi & Regi? Noli dicere possessiones tuas, quia ad ipsa humana jura renunciasti, quibus possiden∣tur possessiones (Ecclesiae.) Et si per jura Regum possidebunt (Episcopi) possessiones, non possunt ut Regi de Ecclesiasticis possessionibus ob∣fequium non exhibeant, sicut antecessores mei suis antecessoribus
exhibuerunt. Quapropter Domine Pater reverendissime, consulite secundum privilegi∣um sedis vestrae, subjectioni nostrae, netalia nobis cujuscunque suggestione mande∣tis, unde inter Episcopalem auctoritatem et Regalem potestatem, inter Ecclesiam et Rempublicam tantum scandalum possit oriri, quod facile ac sine dispendio religionis, vel detrimento Ecclesiasticarum rerum, unde servi, & ancillae Dei debeant nutriri, & Ecclesiastica negotia contineri postea non possit sedari, &c. De eo, quod pusillitati meae vestra rescripsit sublimitas, ut eundem Hincmarum, & alios tres Episcopos omnium Episcoporum Regni, Domini Caroli vicem ferentes, ad Synodum Romam mitterent: Vestra sciat auctoritas, quia nec praedictum Hincmarum, nec etiam quemlibet Episcoporum Diocaescos Remorum, minime autem aliarum Provinciarum Episcopos, nisi Dominus Rex illis praeceperit, Romam, vel in aliquam partem, mea commendatione, mittendi habeo potestatem, nec ipse ego ultra fines sui Regni absque illius scientia progredi valeo. A strong evidence of the French Kings Ec∣clesiastical Supremacy. He writExtant in Bibl. Patrum, Tom. 9. pars 2. p. 217, 218. another Epistle to this Pope, almost to the same effect, which I pretermit. At the same time there fell out a great difference between Charles King of France and Pope Adrian,Anno 870. who writ a most insolent, imperious, scurrilous Letter to him; whereupon he returned this notable reply, in an Epistle to this Pope, (penned, as I conceive, by Archbishop Hincmarus, being printed with his Epistles) answering all the clauses of his unchristian Libel. Bibliotheca Patrum Tom. 9. pars 2. p. 220, 22, &c. Cent. Magd. 9. c. 8. col. 356, 357, 358, 359. Sanctissimo ac Reverendissimo Patri, Hadrano summo Pontifici & Papae, Carolus Dei gratia Rex & spiritualis filius vester. Legimus in lib. Paralip. filios Israel mente pacifica ivisse ad Praelium: quia non livoris vindicta, sed obtinendae pacis gratia di∣micaverunt. Quod rursum dicimus, quia cogitis nos indecentibus potestati Regiae Literis vestris inhonoratum, inconvenientibus Episcopali modestiae vestrae manda∣tis gravatum, contumeliis & opprobriis dehonestatum, aliter quam vellemus mente pa∣cifica vobis rescribere, ut tandem animadvertatis, quamquam perturbationibus huma∣nis obnoxium, in imaginem tamen Dei ambulantem esse nos hominem, habere sensum, paterna & avita successione Dei gratia Regio nomine ac culmine sublimatum: & quod his majus est, Christianum, Catholicum, fidei Orthodoxae cultorem, sacris Lite∣ris ac legibus tam Ecclesiasticis quam secularibus ab infantia eruditum, nullo crimine publico in audientia Episcopali legaliter ac regulariter accusatum, minime autem convictum. Et, ut (quae superaddere poteramus) alia taceamus, ne nos potius jactare, quam vera dicere videamur, licet legamus Apostolum plura de se dixisse ob aliorum salutem necessitate compulsum: Quoniam saepe humiliter vobis locuti, be∣nigna & pacifica atque honorabilia nobis scripta impetrare nequivimus, ut quietam pacis venerationem, quam apud antecessores vestros nostri decessores & nos habui∣mus, quoquomodo obtinere possemus: Scripsimus vobis per Actardum Episcopum, & mansuetudinis nostrae legatum, singillatim ac viritim, quam inconvenientia pro Hincmaro quondam Laudunensi Episcopo, ex nomine vestro nobis scripta fuerunt, quae nos a vobis processisse non credebamus, putantes nos ratione comperta ab in∣competentibus, quae aliorum instinctu nobis eatenus scripta fuerunt, calamum revo∣care. Sed spe vana frustratis, aliter nobis quam sperabamus evenit. In capite quippe Literarum, quas per praefatum Actardum Episcopum nobis vestra direxit pa∣ternitas, auditam laudabilem charitatis & sapientiae nostrae magnitudinem, vos prae∣tulisse invenimus, & mox de comperto murmure, & tumultuoso clamore indebitae reprehensionis adversus paternitatem vestram nos denotatos, reperimus: sicque au∣ditam nostram sapientiam collaudastis, ut quasi honestius, & revera onustius, nos so∣litis contumeliis afficere volueritis, quem non per insipientiam, sed per industriam in murmuratione & clamore contra debitam charitatem delinquere demonstrabitis, & quasi ad ora vasculi melle illiti, & de eodem fonte, quo & ante missae Literae istae posteriores, nobis perniciosum poculum propinaverunt, fatentes illa, quae aliorum instinctu, & non a vobis processisse credamus, vestra fuisse. Nam in praecedentibus Literis nos perjurum, tyrannum, ac perfidum, & distracto∣rem rerum Ecclesiasticarum, non confessum nec ordine judiciario legaliter ac regula∣riter convictum, vocastis: in istis autem murmurationis crimen nobis impegistis, & tumultuosi clamoris naevum imposuistis, arguente Domino carnalem Israel per Prophetam,Ephes. 4: unde nos coarguitis, Quia non fecerit judicium, sed clamorem. Et Apo∣stolus, Omnis, inquit, clamor & indignatio tollatur à vobis. Et non levius malum est murmuratio,1 Cor. 10. his quibus nos antea denotastis, dicente Apostolo, Neque murmuraveri∣tis,
sicut quidam illorum murmuraverunt, & à serpentibus perierunt. Et ut beatus dicit Gregorius, Nullus murmurans Regnum Dei intrare permittitur. Hinc colligendum est, quantum peccatum sit murmuratio quae Regnum Dei intercludit. Sicut & illa pec∣cata gravia,Gal. . post quorum enumerationem dicit Apostolus, Qui talia agunt, Regnum Dei non possidebunt. Et non ut scripsistis tumultuoso clamore paternitatem vestram indebite reprehendimus, sed quae nobis ex vestro nomine scripta fuerunt, non multo∣rum vocibus quibus tumultus fieri solet, sed nostra tantum voce rescripsimus. Et quoniam talia vos misisse & a sancta Romana Ecclesia, in omnibus semper discretissi∣ma atque cautissima, dictata fuisse, nequaquam credidimus; Quia ipsa sancta sedes cum modestia & discretione semper corripere, & salubriter corrigere, secundum uni∣uscujusque personam & ordinem solita fuit suggessimus.Joan. 18. Igitur si male locuti sumus, testimonium perhibete de malo; si autem bene, quid nobis succensetis? Scriptum est Abra∣ham licet sanctum,Genes. 18 ut a Deo sanctificatum hominem, tamen eidem Deo dixisse: Num perdes justum cum impio? non est hoc tuum, qui judicas omnem terram: Et non ingrate hoc Dominum suscepisse: Et nos arguitis, quoniam humili placatione vobis suggessi∣mus, non esse vestrum non confesso, nec legaliter aut regulariter convicto, regia eti∣am potestate gratia Dei praedito, talia sicut plebeio, & de criminibus confutato scri∣bendo impingere,Matth. 5 scientes, quam grave sit fratrr (quod nobis impactis minus est) dicere fatue,Jac. 4. nullique detrahendum vel contra fas maledicendum: minime autem Regi, ut Apostolica doctrina,Rom. 12. atque Sancti in Saulis jam a Domino reprobati reverentia, & Salomonis sapientia,Act: 23. ac Nabuthae prodit historia.1 Reg. 24. 26. Invenimus etiam in eisdem literis nobis datum consilium (si forte dici potest consi∣lium, Prov. 24. quod est Domini exemplo contrarium,3 Reg. 21 & decretis Sanctorum invenitur adver∣sum) scilicet (ut verbis vestris dicamus) Omnia quae a sede Apostolica, cui per Dei gratiam praesidetis, directa sunt, alacri mente percipere, animo grato amplecti, & humili semper debemus intentione recipere. Scriptum est enim nobis ex vestro nomine, Nos perjurum, tyrannum, ac perfidum & distractorem rerum esse Ecclesiasticarum. Et haec alacri mente percipere, animo grato amplecti, & humili semper debemus intentione recipere? Nisi scriptor forte velit nos cum vulgo Aethiopes vocare argenteos; & ideo quis nobis pulcher videatur, qui a nomine bellus vocatur, & sibi cantare cum Persio, Quicquid calcaveris rosa fiat;Esa. 5. illudque Propheticum incurrere: Vae his qui ponunt amarum in dulce;Joan. 8▪ Cum Dominus dicentibus ad se Judaeis: Nonne bene dicimus nos quia Samaritanus es tu, & daemonium habes? quod recognovit, tacendo consensit; & patienter repulit, quod dictum fallaciter audivit, dicens: Ego demonium non habeo. Cujus pro modulo nostro in hoc exemplum secuti, qui non dedignatus ex ratione ostendere se peccatorem non esse, qui ex virtute divinitatis poterat peccatores justi∣ficare; de his quae in nobis non recognovimus humiliter & patienter apud paternita∣tem vestram nos excusavimus, ne, si penitus taceremus, tales; quales denotabamur, tacendo & consentiendo esse nos fateremur; & quasi confessi & nostra confessione convicti judicaremur. Et hoc hortamentum, quod in literis ex nomine vestro ab Actardo Episcopo no∣bis delatis invenimus, scilicet, ut omnia, quae a sede Apostolica nobis vent, humili semper debeamus intentione recipere, non solum, ut praemisimus, Evangelicae veri∣tati, sed etiam decretis sanctorum invenitur adversum. In quorum decretis legimus, Eum absolvi non posse,Con. Val. can. 4 qui in seipsum dixerit mortis causam, qua edicta in alium punire∣tur, falsum videlicet testimonium: cum omnis, qui sibi fuerit mortis causa, major homi∣cida sit. Et hinc decreverunt, Ut quicunque sub ordinatione, vel Diaconatus, vel Pres∣byterii, vel Episcopatus, mortali crimine dixerint se esse pollutos, a supradictis ordinationi∣bus submovendos. Et nos, si ad talia nobis impacta tacendo consentiremus, non solum a regimine regio, verum & a Catholicae Ecclesiae communione nos ipsos sequestra∣remus. Non igitur talia nobis ex parte sedis Apostolicae & nomine vestro scripta, mente alacri percipere, & animo grato amplecti, & humili semper debemus intentio∣ne recipere,Eccles. 12. quae, sicut in eisdem literis ex sententia sapientis Salomonis subjungitur, Quasi stimuli,Eccles. 1 & sicut clavi in altum defixi esse viderentur: quia culpas delinquen∣tium nesciunt palpare,3 Reg. 12. sed pungere. Cui sententiae item Sapientis verba referimus, quibus dixit:2 Reg. 7. Priusquam interroges, ne vituperes quenquam; & cum interrogaveris, id est, probaveris; corripe justè, sicut Nathan David regem prius interrogavit, & inter∣rogatione probatum corripuit: & cum causa correptionis defuit, humiliter adoravit, veluti in sacra historia legimus. Mandate et scribite, quae vestro et nostro mini∣sterio congrmt, ut decessores vestri nobis et nostris decessoribus manda∣verunt, atque scripserunt, & alacri mente, grato{que} animo recipiemus.
Literae autem ex nomine vestro semper sine interrogatione, id est, sine probati∣one nos pungunt, & peccata, pro quibus invitum pungunt, sponte confessa, vel or∣dine judiciario legaliter ac regulariter comprobata non ostendunt, & cum peccata ma∣nifesta & probata desint, fomentis benignae adhortationis & allocutionis non refo∣vent: reprehendente hinc Domino populorum rectores asperos, atque dicente, Vos autem cum austeritate imperabatis eis,Ezech. 34. & cum potentia. Quibus Apostolus regulam dedit commonitionis,2 Tim. 4. singulis dicens: Argue, obsecra, increpa in omni patientia & doctrina: mis∣ceas temporibus tempora, terroribus blandimenta: Dirum magistri, pium patris o∣stendentes affectum, id est, indisciplinatos & inquietos debent durius arguere: obe∣dientes autem ac patientes, ut in melius proficiant, obsecrare: negligentes autem & contemnentes, debent utique increpare aut corripere: & de criminalibus peccatis aut ultro confessos, aut ordine judiciario comprobatos, atque convictos, secundum mo∣dum culpae,De Poenit. Me∣dit. c. 3. legaliter ac regulariter judicare. Noluit Apostolus, inquit beatus Augusti∣nus, hominem ab hoc homine judicari ex arbitrio suspicionis, vel etiam extraordinario usur∣pato judicio: sed potius ex lege Dei, secundum ordinem Ecclesiae, sive ultro confessum, sive accusatum atque convictum. Alioquin illud cur dixit? Si quis cum frater nominatur, aut fornicator, aut idolis serviens, &c. nisi quia eam nominationem intelligi voluit, quae sit in quenquam,1 Cor. 6. cum sententia ordine judiciario atque integritate profertur. Nam si nominatio sufficit, multi damnandi sunt innocentes: quia saepe falso in quenquam crimen nominatur. Pleri{que} antem boni Christiani propterea tacent, & sufferunt aliorum peccata, quae nove∣runt, quia documentis saepe deferuntur, ut ea quae sciunt, judicibus ecclesiastic is probare non possint. Quamvis enim vera sint quaedam, non tamen judici facile credenda sunt, nisi cer∣tis indiciis demonstrentur, nisi ordine judiciario comprobentur: ut si per judicium mali ab Ecclesiae communione auferri non possunt, tolerentur potius, ne perverse malos evitando, quis∣que ab Ecclesia ipse discedens, eos quos fugere videtur, vinciat ad gehennam. Quod scriptum est in eisdem ex nomine vestro literis, quia sane non patienter Pontificii vestri monita, & correctiones, nos audisse comperistis, liquido patet, adhuc perfectae aliquid charitatis minus duntaxat haberet, de qua dicit Apostolus: Charitas patiens est,1 Cor. 13. benigna est, non inflatur, non irritatur, non agit perperam, omnia suffert, om∣nia sustinet. Cujus charitatis modum & perfectionem in benignitate, ac patientia, in humilitate, & sufferentia, exemplo sanctae paternitatis vestrae in literis vestris discere admodum cuperemus, si Deus nos inde honorare dignaretur. Quod & in hoc possemus addiscere, si in his, quae ex nomine vestro nobis scripta, sanctitati vestrae rescripsimus, sustineretis modicum quid insipientiae nostrae, & supporta∣retis nos,2 Cor. 1. sicut magnus Petrus, Apostolicae & primae Sedis primus Episcopus, non so∣lum patienter, sed & gaudenter adeo suscepit reprehensionem suam a coapostolo suo Paulo sibi ostensam,Gal. 2. ut ejus epistolas, in quibus se reprehensum legerat, cum maxi∣mo favore laudaverit.2 Pet. 3. Non enim ita supputate eas laudare poterat, nisi legisset: & quia legit scriptum, reprehensum se in eis invenit: & quoniam eas tam granditer lau∣davit, quam gratanter justam reprehensionem suam accepto tulerit patienter, osten∣dit; Et cum a minoribus suis reprehensus fuit, cur ad Gentiles intraverit, non eis nu∣do & tumido sermone respondit, ut omnia quae egerat patientissime sustinerent: nec aliquid in eorum querela de sua potestate dixit, sed humili ejus ratione placavit, at∣que in causa reprehensionis suae etiam testes adhibuit.Acts 11. Quia si in querela fidelium, ut beatus dicit Gregorius, aquid de sua potestate diceret, profecto Doctor mansue∣tudinis non fuisset. Si igitur pastor Ecclesiae Apostolorum princeps, signa & miracula singulariter fa∣ciens, non dedignatus est, in causa reprehensionis suae, rationem humiliter redde∣re: quanto magis, inquit Gregorius Apostolicae sedis Pontifex, nos peccatores cum de re aliqua reprehendimur, nostros ratione humili placare debemus? Literae autem ex nomine vestro nobis directae, non humili nos ratione placarunt: nec contra rationem nos ex ratione & authoritate quaesiisse monstrarunt: sed indebita incre∣patione os nostrum oppilare studuerunt, quum Dei gratia, libera adhuc fronte de his, quae nobis per literas ex nomine vestro directas impacta sunt, loqui possimus. Scriptum est etiam in praefatis literis nobis ex nomine vestro directis de Hinc∣maro hoc modo.Note the In∣solent stile of this Pope to this King. Volumus, & auctoritate Apostolica jubemus, ipsum Hincmarum Laudunensem Episcopum vestra fretum potentia, ad limina sanctorum, nostramque venire clementiam. Quo sane veniente, veniat pariter accusator idoneus, quia nulla possit aucto∣ritate legitima respui: & tunc in praesentia nostra, & totius sedis Romanae synodali colle∣gio,
causa illius prudenti ventilata examine, ac diligenter inquisita, secundum Deum & sa∣crorum Canonum constitutiones spiritu Dei prolatas, sine protelatione aliqua finietur. Quae relegentes, licet contra morem decessorum ac praedecessorum vestrorum hoc dictum invenerimus,Conc. . Can. 1. id est, umbrosum saeculi typhum inducere in ecclesiam suam, quae lu∣cem simplicitatis & humilitatis diem Domini videre desiderantibus praefert; tamen de voluntate non dubitavimus. Quia humano animo facile potest subripi, quod ex deli∣beratione conveniat immutari. Sed valde mirati sumus, ubi hoc dictator Epistolae no∣bis per Actardum Episcopum delatae scriptum invenetit? esse Apostolica auctori∣tate praecipiendum, ut Rex corrector iniquorum, et districtor reorum, ac secundum leges Ecclesiasticas atque mundanas ultor criminum, reum legaliter & regulariter pro excessibus suis damnatum, sua fretum potentia, Romam dirigat: maxime autem illum, qui & ante depositionem contra custodiam publicam, & contra quietem moliri in tribus Synodis extitit deprehensus, sicut in gestis Episcopalibus paternitati vestrae directis continetur, & post depositionem suam, & per se, & per quoscunque potuit, a sua pervicacia non quievit. Sed non miramur, si in posterioribus literis ex nomine vestro nobis directis, est infulcitum, ut legaliter ac regulariter damnatus, qui nullis legibus decernitur, a quoquam gradu seu rebus aut facultatibus redonandus, antequam si contra custodiam & quietem publicam moliri non fuerit deprehensus, renovato Apostolicae sedis auctoritate ju∣dicio in provincia, qua fuerit judicatus, forte inveniatur innoxius, Regia nostra potentia ad vestram veniat fretus, cum se authore damnato debeatur zelus rectitu∣dinis, non clementia resolutionis: quae si non de eodem foramine, de eodem ta∣men conamine manarunt, de quo & anteriores fluxerunt, in quibus contine∣tur, ut res omnes Hincmaro commissae Ecclesiae, donec ad propria revertere∣tur, nobis committeretis, ut indemnes consisterent, & aliquod dispendium non in∣currerent. Unde, sicut vobis rescripsimus, & nunc iterum vobis scribere non piguit, sed exi∣gente causa necessarium est: quia Reges Francorum ex Regio genere nati, non Episcoporum vicedomini, sed terrae Domini hactenus fuimus computati: & ut Leo ac Romana Synodus scripsit, Reges & Imperatores, quos ter∣ris divina potentia praecepit praeesse, jus distinguendorum negotiorum Episcopis sanctis juxta divalia constituta permiserunt; non autem Episcoporum villici extiterunt. Et sanctus Augustinus dicit; Per jura regum possidentur possessiones: non autem per E∣piscopale imperium Reges villici fiunt, actoresque Episcoporum. Et Dominus,Mat. 22▪ Quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari: & quae sunt Dei, Deo reddi praecipit; qui etiam censum regi reddidit. Et Apostolus voluit serviri Regibus, voluit honorari, et non conculcari Reges;Mat. 1. Regem, inquit, honorificate. Et iterum, Omnis, inquiens, anima potestatibus sublimioribus subdita sit:1 Pet. 2▪ Reddite ergo omnibus debita. Et paulo su∣perius: Ideo necessitate subditi estote,Rom. 13. non solum propter iram, sed & propter conscienti∣am. Et si revolueritis regesta decessorum ac praedecessorum vestrorum, talia man∣data, sicut habentur in literis ex nomine vestro nobis directis per Actardum Epis∣copum, decessores nostros a decessoribus vestris accepisse nullatenus invenie∣tis: Unde pauca de pluribus vobis scribere necessarium duximus. Sanctus Gregorius, merito vitae & sapientiae doctrina Apostolicae sedis Pontifex, & toti orbi colendus, Francorum Regibus Theodorico & Theodeberto praedecessoribus nostris, de praejudicio cujusdam Episcopi, non ita, ut vos nobis scripsistis, pro eo, qui pro meritis suis ac regulariter juste depositus est, scripsit hoc modo. Frater & coepiscopus noster Ursinus Taurinae Civitatis antistes, in parochiis suis, quae intra Regni vestri sunt terminos constitutae, grave omnino dicitur praejuicium sustinere: adeo ut contra Ecclesiasticam observatiam, contraque Sacerdotalem gravitatem, & contra sacrorum Canonum definita, nullo ejus exigente crimine, alter illis nunc meruerit ordinari. Et quia parum visum est, si in licitis non jungerentur illicita, etiam res Ecclesiae suae (ut fertur) ab∣latae sunt. Quod si ita se veritas habet, quoniam nimis intolerabile est, ut virtute oppri∣meretur, cui culpa non nocuit, praemisso paternae salutationis alloquio, petimus, ut quod ex∣cellentia vestra amore Ecclesiasticae reverentiae, & aequitatis contemplatione, sponte potest impendere, nostrae studeat benignius intercessioni concedere: & justitiam illi, sicut de aequitatis ejus bona confidimus, faciat in omnibus custodiri, atque patefacta veritate, quod illicite actum est corrigi. Pro utilitate ergo animae vestrae haec apud vos nostra exhortatic locum inveniat, &c.
Sed & ad Romanum Exarchum, minoris dignitatis, quam simus Dei gratia Regiae potestatis, de quodam Episcopo scripsit hoc modo. Pervenit ad nos, Blandum Orto∣nesis civitatis Episcopum, longo jam tempore, in civitate Ravennatia vestra excellentia detineri, & fit ut Ecclesia sine rectore, & populus quasi sine pastore grex fuit: & ibidem infante pro pccatis absque baptismate moriantur. Et rursus. Quia non credimus, quod cum excellentia vestra, nisi ex aliqua probabilis excessus causa tenuerit, oportet, ut habita Synodo, palam fiat, si quod in eum crimen intenditur, & si talis in eo culpa reperiatur, quae ad usque degradationem Sacerdotii deducatur; aliam ordinationem necesse est inquiramus, ne Ecclesia Dei in his, sine quibus eam Christiana non patitur esse Religio, inculta ac de∣stituta maneat. Sin autem excellentia vestra aliter se habere, quam de eo quod dicitur esse, perspexerit, eum ad Ecclesiam suam reverti concedat, ut officium suum in commissis sibi animabus adimpleat. Quibus mandatis B. Gregorii praedecessoris vestri de his, qui nec dum judicio Synodali legaliter ac regulariter pro criminibus suis fuere depositi, collatis cum scriptis ex nomine vestro ac nobis directis, ex eo qui legaliter ac regulari∣ter pro suis excessibus judicio Synodali habetur depositus, ut eum nostra fretum po∣tentia Romam mittamus, quae potius sequenda sint, judicate. Nos autem authori∣tatem vestram judicaturam potius credimus, ut ea sequamur, quae decessores ac praedecessores vestri secundum Scripturarum tramitem, praedicationemque majorum scripserunt, quam illa, quae scriptor sae∣pe dictae Epistolae ex nomine vestro nobis directae confinxit. Ait enim beatus Augustinus libro ad Jannuarium, Omnia talia, quae neque sanctarum Scripturarum auctoritatibus continentur, nec Conciliis Episcoporum statuta inveniuntur, nec consuetudine universalis Ecclesiae roborata sunt, resecanda existimo. Et S. Leo, de his quae a sacris Canonibus habentur ita praefixa, & eisdem Apostolicae sedis sunt pro∣mulgata decris, ut nullapossint ratione convelli, constituit; Ut omni penitus autoritate fit vacuum, quicquid ab illorum fuerit constitutione diversum. Ac si cum Paulo diceret; Quia sibi ipsi Apostolica sedes in suis constitutionibus esse non potest contraria;Galat. 1. Li∣cet nos, aut Angelus de coelo Evangelizet vobis paeter quod Evangelizavimus vobis, ana∣thema sit. Sed ut in controversia Quintiliani legitur, Floribus vafricia nebulonum veneficatis apes mortuas esse, quibus mellificandum fuerat; De Scripturis sacris B. Pe∣trus agi demonstrat,2 Pet. 3. loquens de Pauli Epistolis, Quae indocti & instabiles, inquit, de∣pravant, sicut & caeteras Scripturas ad suam ipsorum perditionem: Et de traditionibus Ecclesiasticis S. Innocentius,Ad Decentium Episcopum Eugub. Dum, inquiens, unusquisque non quod traditum est, sed quod sibi visum fuerit, hoc existimat esse tenendum, inde diversa in diversis locis aut Ec∣clesiis, aut teneri, aut celebrari videntur, ac fit scandalum populis, qui, dum nesciunt tra∣ditiones antiquas humana praesumptione corruptas, putant sibi aut Ecclesiis non convenire, aut ab Apostolis vel Apostolicis viris contrarietatem inductam. Contra quem morbum S. Caelestinus salubre cunctis celebravit antidotum, dicens: Nulli Sacerdoti suos liceat Ca∣nones ignorare,Epist. 2. nec quicquam facere quod Patrum regulis possit obviare. Quae enim a no∣bis res digna servabitur, si decretalium norma constitutorum, pro aliquorum libitu licen∣tia populis permissa frangatur? Et sanctus Gelasius in decretis suis: Patres nostri, Ca∣tholici videlicet & docti Pontifices, in unaquaque secta, quolibet tempore suscitata, quic∣quid pro fide, pro veritate, pro communione Catholica at{que} Apostolica, secundum Scriptu∣rarum tramitem, praedicationem{que} majorum, facta semel congregatione sanxerunt, incon∣vulsum voluerunt deinceps firmum{que} constare: nec in eadem causa denuo quae praefixa fue∣rant retractari, qualibet recenti praesumptione permiserunt. Videndum est igitur, quid hic trames sanctarum scripturarum, & praedicatio majo∣rum definiant. Scriptum quippe legimus in sacra historia dixisse Dominum per Pro∣phetam Josaphat Regi,2 Paral. 19. Impio praebes auxilium, & his qui derunt Dominum amicitia jungeris: & idcirco iram quidem Domini merebaris, sed bona opera inventa suns in te, eo quod abstuleris lucos de terra Juda.Matth. 18. Et in Evangelio semel & ecundo ac tertio moni∣tum, & non obedientem ad correctionem debitam, Dominus sicut Ethnicum & pub∣licanum jubet haberi. Et beatus Gregorius in decretis suis, sicut in gestis Synodi invenire potestis, per∣vasorem non solum rerum alienarum, sed etiam Ecclesiae sibi commissae anathemati∣zatum definit: verum etsi alius hoc egerit, is qui praeest Ecclesiae, si hoc vel ipse fieri praecipit, vel sine sua praeceptione factum digna punire animadversione negle∣xerit, Deut. 17. eum anathematizat: satis ergo mirari non possumus, unde scriptor Epistolae, nobis ex nomine vestro delatae,Gal. 3. hanc legem apud se auro sculptam produxit, quam
Dominus digito suo non scripsit; nec scribendam cuiquam inspiravit, neque ordinatam per Angelos in manu Mediatoris illius dedit: quam non paganus indixit, non Chri∣stianus induxit, non Ecclesiasticus vir decrevit, quae de se sub isto coelo sicut non at∣tramento manu justitiae, ita nec Spiritu Dei vivi scripta personuit: qua me Regem a Deo constitutum, et gladio ex utraque parte acuto: ultore scilicet nocentium & defensore innocentium inignitum,Rom. 23. ad vindictam malefactorum, ut ex∣ponit Apostolus, laudem vero bonorum, rei atque damnati, atque anathematizari fau∣torem esse praecipit, jubemus ut Hincmarum sacrarum legum praevaricatorem, sancti Sacerdotii vituperatorem, Regiae dignitatis contra regulam Apostolicam dehortato∣rem, regni perturbatorem, perjurum, & seditionum authorem, Ecclesiae sibi commis∣sae afflictorem, facultatum Ecclesiasticarum sacrilegum, fraudatorem, ac extirpato∣rem Episcoporum, ac totius populi nostrarum partium scandalizatorem, alienarum rerum pervasorem, & veniendo contra subscriptiones & professiones suas a scipso damnatum, potentia Regia frerum, Romam venire facamus. Quis igitur hanc universam legem infernus evomuit? Quis tartarus de suis abditis & tenebrosis cumculis eructavit? Contra quam literis sacris ostensa nobis est via,3 Reg. 2. quam sequamur, apposita forma, cui impriimmur. Clamavit, inquit, Propheta ad Regem Israel, & ait: Servus tuus egressus est ad praeandum cominus: cumque fugisset vir unus, adduxit eum quidam ad me, & dixit: Custodi virum istum, qui fuerit lapsus, erit anima tua pro anima ejus, aut talentum argenti appendes. Dum autem ego turbatus huc illucque me vrterem, subito non comparuit. Et ait Rex Israel ad eum, Hoc est judi∣cium tuum, quod ipse decrevisti. At ille statimabstersit pulverem de facie sua, & cogno∣vit eum Rex Israel, quod esset de Prophetis. Qui ait ad eum, Haec dicit tibi Dominus; Quia dimisisti virum dignum morte  manu tua, erit anima tua pro anima ejus, & popu∣lus tuus pro populo ejus. Reversus est igitur Rex Israel in domum suam audire contem∣nens, & furibundus venit in Samariam. Quaenam vos dementia coepit scientes dixisse Christum Dei virtutem & Dei sapientiam?Prov. . Per me Reges regnant, & conditores le∣gum justa decernunt. Et sacri Canones (sicut credimus, & in Apostolicis literis saepius regimus) Spiritu Dei conditi, & totius mundi reverentia sunt consecrati; propterea videamus, quid de hujusmodi sancti Canones & sacrae leges decernant: Ait enim S. Africanum Concilium,Can. 29: Et illud petendum (quin apud terrae Principes) statuere dignen∣tur, ut si quis cujusibet honoris clricus judicio Episcoporum quocumque crimine fuerit dam∣natus, non liceat eum sive ab Ecclesiis quibus praefuit; sive a quolibet homine defensari, interposita poena damni, pecuniae at{que} honoris, quo nec aetatem, nec sexum excusandum esse praecipiant. Et tunc Valens, Gratianus & Valentinianus constituerunt, Ʋt quicun{que} residenti∣bus Sacerdotibus fuerit Episcopali loco detrusus, & nomine; si aliquid contra custodiam publicam, vel contra quietem moliri fuerit deprehensus; rursumque Sacerdotium petere, a quo videtur expulsus, procul ab urbe quam infecit, secundum legem divae memoriae Gra∣tiani, centum millibus vitam agat, sit ab eorum caetibus separatus, a quorum est societate discretus; Sique hujusmodi personis illicatum, hujus legis tenore, sacra nostra adire secreta, & imperare scripta, omnibus abiectis per culpam Sacerdotio personis, quae impretata sunt infecta permoveant, scituris his, quorum defensione nituntur, absque sui praehensione non futurum, si hoc eis pollicetur suffragium, qui divinum no videntur merie judicium. Unde & Leo Papa apud principalem potestatem petiit de Eutiche scandali & pravitatis authore, Ut ab eo loco, qui Constantinopolitanae urbi nimis vicinus erat, longius trans∣ferretur, ne frequentioribus solatiis eorum, quos ad impietatem suam traxit, uteretur. Et Gregorius Paulum Diadinae civitatis quondam Episcopum, quousque omne, quod dilapidavit, vel de substantia tulit Ecclesiae, restitueret, in monasterium mirten∣dum esse decrevit. Et si sorte post depositionem suam inverecunde ac mente perver∣sa aliquando de Episcopatu loqui, aut rursus ad hoc qualibet aspirare praesumptione tentaverit, Dominici corporis & sanguinis communione privatum, in monasterio e∣um usque ad diem obitus sui, ad agendam poenitentiam retrudi, studio Joannis Primae Justinianae Episcopi jussit, ut perpetrati sceleris maculas dignus disceret fletibus e∣mendare, juxta legem Justiniani imper. qui in libro Constitutionum decrevit. Ut si quis Episcopus explosus, ausus fuerit ingredi civitatem, d qua repulsus est, vel exire de loco, in quo degere iussus est, jubemus eum in monasterio, in alia Provincia constituto tradi, ut quae in Sacerdotio peccavit, degens in monasterio corrigat. Quas leges ab Imp. et Re∣gibus nostris yidelicet praedecessoribus, promulgatas atque decretas, nos immu∣tilate et irrefragabiliter convenit conservare, sicut Apostolicae sedis Antistites
ad Dominos & terrae Principes scripserunt: Ait enim Leo ad Leonem Augustum, De∣bes, inquiens, incunctanter advertere Regiam potestatem tibi non ad solum mundi regimen, sed maxime ad Ecclesiae praesidium esse collatam, ut ausus nefarios comprimendo, quae bene sunt statuta, defendas, & veram pacem his, quae sunt turbata, restituas. Et Gelasius ad Anastasium: Etenim Imperator Auguste, si contra leges publicas ali∣quid (quod absit) quispiam fortasse tentaret, nulla id ratione potuisset admitti. Quas eti∣am leges principales authoritate promulgatas, non solum quibuscumque Episcopis, sed etiam ab ipsis Apostolicae sedis Pontificibus, ipsius primae sedis Antistites obser∣vari debere scripserunt, sicut beatus Leo ad Leonem Augustum scribes demonstrat, dicens, Non se refragari debere edicta Imperialia, vel ea quae sui decessores secundum tramitem scripturarum praedicationemque majorum statuerant. Si quae, inquiens, destruxi, ego aedifico, praevaricatorem me constituo, & eis me ultionum conditionibus subdo, quas non solum auctoritas beatae memoriae Principis Martiani, sed etiam ego mea consen∣sione firmavi. Et S. Gelasius ad Anastasium Imperatorem,Epi. 10 Si, inquit, quantum ad ordinem publi∣cae pertinet disciplinae, cognoscentes imperium tibi superna dispositione collatum, legibus tuis ipsi quoque parent roligionis Antistites, ne vel in rebus mundanis excluso, videantur obviare sententiae: Quo, oro te, affectu eis convenit obedire, qui pro erogandis venerabilibus sunt at∣tributi mysteriis. Quod & nos juxta hortamentum beati Gelasii incunctanter atque libenter exequi cupimus in his, quae ad suum ministerium pertinent, cunctis genera∣liter Sacerdotibus recte divina tractantibus, & potissime sedis illius Praesulis, quem cunctis Sacerdotibus divinitas summa voluit praeeminere,de Anath. vinc. & subsequens Ecclesiae ju∣giter pietas celebravit: sicut nostri decessores ac progenitores orthodoxi Imperato∣res, & Reges egerunt, ut & Apostolicae sedis Pontifex, & reliqui Domini Sacerdotes nobis, quae a Deo sunt consecuta, exhibeant: Scientes sicut idem B. Gelasius dicit, Quoniam Christus memor fragilitatis humanae, quod suorum saluti congrueret, dispensa∣tione magnifica temperavit, sic actionibus propriis, dignitatibusque distinctis officia pote∣statis utriusque discrevit, suosque volens medicinali humilitate salvari, non humana su∣perbia rursus intercipi, ut & Christiani Principes pro aeterna vita Pontificibus indigerent, & Pontifices pro temporalium cursu rerum Imperialibus dispositionibus uterentur: quate∣nus spiritualis actio à carnalibus distaret incursibus: & ideo militans Deo minime se nego∣tiis saecularibus implicaret, ac vicissim non ille rebus divinis praesidere videretur, qui esset negotiis saecularibus implicatus,2 Tim. 2. ut & modestia utriusque ordinis curaretur, nec extollere∣tur utro{que} suffultus, & competens qualitatibus actionum specialiter professio aptaretur. Omnis Pontifex, inquit Apostolus, ex hominibus assumptus, pro hominibus constituitur in his quae sunt ad Deum,Heb. 5. ut offerat dona & sacrificia pro peccatis, videlicet non solum pro populi, sed quia & ipse circundatus est infirmitate, pro suis. Et Regis est regni negotia dispensare, sicut inculcant literae divinitus inspiratae. Quia ergo sanctarum Scripturarum tramite, & praedicatione majorum ostenditur sancto etiam attestante Galesio,Epist. 10. Quia duo sunt, quibus principaliter mundus hic regitur, auctoritas sacra Pontifi∣cum, & Regalis potestas. Et per Regem Regum, ac summum Pontificem cunctorum Pontificum,Prov. 8. qui solus Rex & Sacerdos fieri potuit, Conditores legum justa decernunt: Quas leges Principales potestates appellaverunt aeternas, & sacri Canones Spiritu Dei sunt conditi, & totius mundi reverentia consectati, & ut beatus Ambrosius ad Va∣lentinianum dicit, Legis Imperator fert, quas primus ipse custodiat, quia quod praescrip∣sit aliis, praescripsit sibi, ne cui esset liberum aliud judicare. Et beatus Augustinus dicit, Quia postquam leges subscriptae fuerint & firmatae, non licet judici de ipsis judicare, sed se∣cundum ipsas: Quia secundum Pontificale Ministerium vestrum, regio ministerio no∣stro monita vestrae paternitatis obedienter ac libenter cupimus obaudire: patimini nos ea servare, quae praedecessores vestri ac nostri de hujusmodi, unde agitur, con∣stituerunt, & roborantes servando, quae gesta sunt, rata doceamus esse debere, quae gerimus. Nam quomodo leges Principum rite vocabuntur aeternae, si transeunti∣bus principibus, una cum eis constitutio legis transibit? Et Papa Symmachus ad Eoni∣um; Dum, inquit, ad Trinitatis instar, cui una est at{que} individua potestas unum, sit per diversos Antistites Sacerdotium, quomodo priorum statuta a sequentibus convenit violari? Huc accedit, quod sibaec eveniat sententiarum varietas ad ipsam sacrosanctam religionem credimus pertinere, cujus omnis potestas infringitur, nisi universa, quae a Domini Sacer∣dotibus semel statuuntur perpetua sint. Quod alias contingere poterit, si successor decesso∣ris actibus non tribuerit firmitatem, & roborando quae gesta sunt, faciat rata esse quae ges∣serit? Quanta enim Vicariis B. Petri Apostoli judicabitur esse reverentia, si quae in Sa∣cerdotio
praecipiunt, eisdem transeuntibus dissolvantur. Ʋniversa, inquit, perpetua sint, quae a Domini Sacerdotibus statuuntur, qui ut Moyses, ea quae statuunt ab oraculo divino suscipiunt: non quae ab his statuuntur, de quibus per Prophetam dicitur: Vae his qui condunt leges iniquas, & scribentes injustitiam scripserunt. Et nihilominus, quae a Vicariis B. Petri costituuntur maneant inconvuls.Esa. 1 Quia ut Leo dicit, nec nimia est severitas vel remissio, ubi nihil constituitur, nisi quod ex beati Petri aequitate profertur. Haec enim scimus esse Canonica,Serm. 3. n an∣nv. scimus esse Apostolica auctoritate robrata, & Apostolicae sedis decreta, quae, ut Gelasius dicit, unamquamque Synodum & sua auctoritate confirmat, & continua modo ratione custodit, pro suo scilicet principatu, quem B. Petrus Apostolus Domini voce,Ep. ad Darda. praeceptum, Ecclesia nihilominus subsequente, & tenuit semper & retinet. Et paulo superius. Confidimus quod nullus jam veraciter Christianus ignorat, uniuscuus{que} Synodi constitutum,Epist. 6. quod universalis Ecclesiae probavit assensus, nullum magis exequi sedem prae caeteris oportere, quam primam. Et item idem. Cum∣que nobis contra salutarium reverentiam regularum cupiamus temere licere, & cum sedes Apostolica super his omnibus favente Domino, quae paternis Canonibus sunt praefixa, pio devotoque studeat tenere proposito, satis indignum est, quenquam, vel Pontificum, vel ordinum subsequentium, hanc observantiam refutare, quam B. Petri sedem & sequi vide∣at & docere: Satisque conveniens sit, ut totum corpus Ecclesiae in hac sibimet observatione concordet, quam illic videre conspiciat, ubi Dominus Ecclesiae totius posuit principatum. Et de sacris legibus,Epist. 10. quas una cum Sanctis Canonibus Catholica observat Ecclesia, idem Gelasius, ut praemisimus, dicit in Epistola ad Anastasium Imperatorem, Quan∣tum, inquiens, ad ordinem publicae pertinet disciplinae, cognoscentes imperum tibi su∣perna dispositione collatum, legibus tuis ipsi quoque parent Religionis An∣tistites, ne vel in rebus mundanis exclusae videantur obviare sententiae. Et cum ita sacrae leges, tam Ecclesiasticae quam mundanae, de damnato Episcopali & Synodali Concilio decernant, non est nostri Regii ministerii, reum & sacrorum Canonum judicio condemnatum, atque Apostolicae sedis definitione, sicut in gestis Synodi invenire potestis, anathematizatum, nostra potentia fretum quoquam dirige∣re: cum apertissime sacri Canones definiant, & leges Justiniani ac caeterorum Impe∣ratorum Catholicorum edicta qualiter, & pro quibus & a quibus debeat Episcopus ju∣dicari; & post judicium, quid & qualiter, & per quos sit inde Apostolicae sedis agen∣dum: quae non abnuimus, sed incunctanter & competenter annuimus. A quibus definitionibus nulli est licitum deviare: quia, ut S Hilarus Papa dicit, Non minus in Sanctarum traditionum delinquitur sanctiones, quam in injuriam ipsius Do∣mini prosilitur. Quocirca,Malach. . quia Dominus dicit per Prophetam, Labia Sacerdotis custodient scienti∣am, & legem requirent ex ore ejus, quia Angelus, id est, nuncius Domini exercituum est; Nolite permittere nobis scribi ex vestrae authoritatis nomine, quae in legibus sacris, Dei sapientia conditis, & in sanctis regulis Spiritu promulgatis, non continen∣tur, Ezech. . dicente item Propheta, id est, Sacerdoti praecipiente, Audiens nunciabis eis ex me, ex me inquit,Joan. 7. & non ex te, Et redarguuntur, qui de corde suo loquuntur. Quoni∣am, qui à semetipso loquitur, gloriam proprium quaerit: Nolite igitur, t praemisimus, ex vestro nomine, vel Apostolicae sedis authori∣tate, visiones vel excommunicationum intentationes contra sacrarum scriptu∣rarum tramitem, praedicationem{que} majorum ac sacrarum legum, sanctorum{que} Ca∣nonum constitutiones nobis de caetero scribi cuiuscun{que} instinctu permittere pre∣camur. Quia scitis,Serm. 3. in an∣nv. & scimus, totum esse irritum, quicquid ab eorum fuerit constitutione diver∣sum. Dicitur, inquit S. Leo, à Domino beatissimo Petro, Tibi dabo claves regni coelo∣rum, Matth. 1. & quemcunque solveris super terram, erunt soluta & in coelis. Transivit quidem e∣tiam in alios Apostolos jus istius potestatis, & ad omnes Ecclesiae principes decreti hujus constitutio commeavit: sed non frustrauni commendatur, quod omnibus intimatur. Petro enim ideo hoc singulariter creditur, quia cunctis Ecclesiae rectoribus Petri forma praeponitur. Manet ergo Petri privilegium, ubi ex ipsius aequitate fertur udicium: Qua sententia con∣stat, quia non manet Petri privilegium, ubi ex ipsius a quitate non fertur judicium. Cum enim ubicunque dicitur, sicuti nullus locus, ita nemo rector Ecclesiae, ex Petri aequitate judicium. Cum enim ubicunque dicitur, sicuti nullus locus, ita nemo rector Ecclesiae ex Petri aequitate judicum ferens excipitur, vel contra illius aequitatem ju∣dicium proferens commendatur. Et quia ubicunque sine ulla exceptione non manet Petri privilegium, ubi ex ipsius aequitate non fertur judicium, prolatum obaudiemus
jussum, vel recipiemus judicium, quod non ex Petri aequitate fuerit prolatum ac per hoc ipsius privilegio fuerit destitutum? De quo Episcopali judicio, quid cunctis E∣piscopis sequendum, & quid Ecclesiae filiis sit tenendum atque servandum, B. Grego∣rius sufficienter inculcat. Ergo jubete & judicate privilegio magni Petri juxta aequitatis ejus judicium, quae jubenda & judicanda sunt. Ne, ut dicit ejus Coapostolus, vituperetur ministerium ve∣strum. 2 Cor. 6. Quia & nos secundum regium ministerium nostrum, quantum ex nobis est cupi∣mus servare quod scriptum est,Ephes. 6. Filii, obedite parentibus vestris in Domino, videlicet, quod fuerit jussum,Psal. 44. vel indicatum a Domino: dicente illo singulis, quia pro patribus, Apostolis Ecclesiae,Ezech. 3. nati sunt filii, Apostolici viri: Tu autem audiens nunciabis eis ex me.Num. 22. Divina quippe nos lectio docet, quia nec etiam Balaam satis superque a Rege Balac petitus, licet medicamento avaritiae delinitus in concilio dando corruptus osten∣derit, ullo tamen aut ullius instinctu in judicio justitiae aliud loqui adversus Israel per∣suaderi vel extorqueri potuit, quam quod a Domino audivit. De eo, quod in literis ex nomine vestro nobis directis habetur, Ut veniente Hinc∣maro Romam, veniat accusator idoneus, qui nulla possit auctoritate legitima respui: rescri∣bimus: Quia licet haec commendatio nulla sit ratione atque auctoritate suffulta, si for∣te apud vos exlex solus Hincmarus nova lege priscis tam publicis, quam Ecclesiasticis contraria, imo ordine novo{que} more habetur, ut non nisi a vobis et Romae valeat judicari pro his excessibus, de quibus habentur certa sacrorum Canonum ac legum decreta: Quae, ut Leo dicit, nulla possunt ratione convelli, cum etiam de causa fidei, ut dicit Gelasius, cuicum{que} Pontifici licet secundum regulam erroris ante damnati, quemlibet a Ca∣tholica communione discernere; Et ego ita exors ab omnibus accusationibus, non solum ab his quibus legaliter & regulariter accusandi adversus seipsum denegatur licentia, verum & ab his quibus in propriis causis accusatio non negatur: ut sicut leges & re∣gulae jubent, in Provincia, in qua sunt orta negotia, terminari non valeant, & secun∣dum Antiochenos Canones, Provincialium Synodorum non debeant experiri examen. Si vobis vias cum voluntate & consensu dilectissimi nepotis nostri Imperatoris vestri, contra cujus dilectionem & debitum honorem vobis exhibere studuerit, illuc ire non volumus, obtinueritis, cooperante Domino, pace in regno nostro contra Paga∣nos virtute vel quacunque dispositione Dei obtenta, Romam venire congruo tempo∣re non differemus. Et quia illum legaliter aut regulariter in Synodo Episcoporum, plurimarum Provinciarum de certis causis accusavimus, idoneum nos accusatorem il∣lius ostendemus: & tantos testes idoneos diversi ordinis ac dignitatis nobiscum duce∣mus, cum quibus eum legaliter ac regulariter nos accusasse, & comprobasse, suffici∣entissime comprobabimus. Tandem, quia vos non legisse, vel audisse collegimus ex literis ab Actardo Episcopo nobis delatis, quae antea per illum paternitati vestrae di∣reximus, iterato scribimus ea, quae tunc scripseramus, deprecantes vos in omnipotentis Dei honore, & Sanctorum Apostolorum veneratione, ut tales inhonorationis nostrae Epistolas, talia{que} mandata, sicut hactenus ex nomine vestro suscepimus, nobis, et regni nostri Episcopis ac Primoribus de caetero non mandetis, et non com∣pellatis nos mandata, et Epistolas vestras inhonorandas contemnere, et mis∣sos vestros dehonorare, qui, vobis, in his, quae ad vestrum ministerium pertinent, si tamen ministerium vestrum, cupimus obtemperare. Quae pro vestri honore privilegii vobis dicimus, quia vobis, sicut revera Vicario B. Petri Apostolorum Principis, in omnibus debite ac competenter obedire desideramus, & ne aliter eveniat cavere per omnia cu∣pimus, ac vestram sanctitatem id ipsum cavere humili prece deposcimus: ne nos & nostros satis invitos ad id cogatis convertere quod in quinta Universali Synodo, a se∣de Apostolica ut in Apostolicis literis, praecipue autem in Synodica B. Gregorii ad quatuor Patriarchas, & in aliis ejus Epistolis, una cum quatuor praecedentibus legi∣mus collandatum atque susceptum invenitur, nobis tenendum. Quod adhuc nostris literis ad exemplum inserere no luimus donec sciamus, si duritiam mandatorum ve∣strorum erga nos aliter ad benignitatem inflectere poterimus. Quia quod ex Apo∣stolicae sedis nomine secundum sanctarum Scripturarum tramitem, praedicationemque majorum & orthodoxorum decreta scribuntur, sequendum & tenendum non igno∣ravimus; et quod secus a quoquam fuerit compilatum sive confictum, non solum respuendum, sed et redarguendum esse cognoscimus. Si denique aliter quam nos & vos decuerat, reverendistimae paternitati vestrae rescribendo, factus sum insipiens, vos me coegistis. Petimus autem omnipotentem Dominum ut inspiret cordi vestro sic nos benigne tractare, quatenus ulterius nobis non sit necesse vobis ita rescribere.
Sed ut cupimus in veneratione Apostolorum Apostolico Pontificio vestro humiliter ac devote colla & corda submittere. Deus omnipotens ad honorem & salutationem, at∣que exaltationem sanctae suae Ecclesiae, vos per multa annorum curricula conservare dignetur, Domine sanctissime & reverendissime pater in Domino. Hincmarus Archbishop of Rhemes with his Suffragans,Anno 846. and four other Archbishops of France with their Suffragans, by command of this King Charles, in their respe∣ctive Synods, compiled several Canons and Ecclesiastical decrees, which they presen∣ted to the King and his Nobles, to confirm and ratify; Upon perusal, they finding some of them entrenching upon the Kings prerogative; the Priviledges of the Nobles, and peoples Liberties, and giving overmuch power to the Bishops by enlarging their Ec∣clesiastical Jurisdictions, the Nobles would by no means assent unto them, but on∣ly selected 21. out of 88. of their Canons,Codex Legur Antiquarum, p. 1196, 1197, &c. rejecting all the rest, which 21. were confirmed by King Charles, and published in his Name with this Title; [a] Karoli Hludovici Imp. F. Capitula, printed in [b] Fredericus Lindebregus, with this pre∣face to them. Haec quae sequuntur Capitula excerpta sunt a Domino Rege Caro∣lo, Domini Hludovici Imp. Filio, & Principibus ejus, ex Capitulis quae anno DCCCXLVI. ediderantSee Surius Concil. Tom. 3. p. 454, &c. Episcopi in Synodis, Wenilo scilicet cum Suffraganeis suis; Guntboldus cum Suffraganeis suis; Ursmarus cum Suffraganeis suis; Hincmarus cum Suffraganeis suis; Amalo cum Suffraganeis suis: et oblata sunt (some time after) eidem Principi, sicut ipse jusserat, collecta ad relegendum, in Spar∣naco Villa Remensis Ecclesiae. Et quia, factione qudrundam, motus est animus ipsius Regis contra Episcopos, dissidentibus regni sui Primoribus ab eorundem Episcoporum admonitione, et remotis ab eodem Concilio Episcopis, ex omnibus illis Capitulis, Haec tan∣tum observanda et complacenda sibi collegerunt, et Episcopis scri∣pto tradiderunt; dicentes, Non amplius de eorum Capitulis accep∣tasse, quam ista, et ista se velle cum Principe observare. A memo∣rable clear Evidence, 1. That no Ecclesiastical Canons and Constitutions made by Archbishops and Bishops in their Synods, were obligatory, or valid, unlesse first exa∣mined, approved by Kings and their Nobles, to whom they were usually presented for their examination, & ratified, if approved by them. 2ly. That the Nobles, as well as Kings and Emperors, had a negative voice in Councils and Synods, to reject Canons or Constitutions when made and drawn up in them by the Bishops. 3ly. That they rejected such of them as they deemed prejudicial to the Crown, their own or the peoples Priviledges, or enlarged the Bishops Ecclesiastical Authority beyond its due antient limits, which the Bishops were over prone to amplify in most of their Synods, as well as Popes; that so they might tyrannize over Kings, Nobles, and Laymen at their pleasures. Anno 876. there was a General Synod (as the Romanists stile it) assembled at Constantinopl,Anno 876 consisting of 373. Bishops;Surius Con∣cil. Tom. 3. p. 530, 531, 539. Cent. Magd. 9. c. 9. col. 426, 427, 559, 560. Money Myste∣rium Iniquita∣tis, p. 180, 181, 152. wherein these particulars are observa∣ble; 1. That it was summoned by the Emperor Basilius his industry, about the resti∣tution of Ignatius to the See of Constantinople, of which he was deprived by Michael the Emperor, and to remove Photius, intruded into it in his room. 2ly. That Pope Adrian the 2d. writ to this Emperor, importuning him to summon this Council. 3dly. That this Pope sent his Legates to it. 4ly. That this Emperor Basilius, though he advanced the Popes Supremacy over the Greek Church in a great measure in this Council, yet in exordio Synodi ita locutus est; Cum divina et benignissima pro∣videntia NOBIS GUBERNACULA UNIVERSALIS NAVIS (Ecclesiae) COM∣MISISSET, (not to the Pope, or Patriarch of Constantinople, the two competitors for this trust) omne studium arripuus, et ante publicas curas Ecclesiasti∣cas, Ecclesiasticas dissolvere et procellas, quae per multos annos ex invidia odi∣entis bonum Satanae expansae sunt, in stabilem tranquilitatem per meliorem quan∣dam provisionem transferre, &c. Igitur iis quae prava vobis omnibus esse videbantur et aspera, in vias planas imperatoria diligentiaet stu∣dio nostro translatis, commonemus et hortamur omnes vos fratres, ut cum multo pondere et reverentia conveniatis ad sanctam hanc et universalem Synodum, tanquam ad communem et universis aptam,
atque sine labore medelam, nullam vitiosam motionem, vel affectum ferentes, nec ad contentiosam voluntatem respicientes, sed potius vinci bene, quam vincere periculose ac injuste sitientes. Sic enim unusquis{que} qui vitiatum interiorem patitur hominem, sanitatem re∣cipiet, et aeternam salutem percipiet, &c. 5ly. That Photius the Patriarchand his followers summoned to and entring into this Synod,Surius, Tom. 3. p. 531, 539, 540, 54, 542 Cent. Magd. 9. col. 353, 354, 487, 488. Zo∣nara Annal. Tom. 3. Actio 4. & 5. would give no an∣swer at all to the Questions demanded of them by the Popes Legats, nor acknowledge their authority: wherupon the Legates spake thus to the Princes, Principibus, qui jussu Basii Imperatoris interfuerunt Interrogate illos magni, fortissimi, & gloriosissimi Principes, an illi qui introterunt, faciunt libellum hoc? That Actio 7. Bahanis Pa∣tricius, et Praepositus, dixit ad Synodum, Photio praesente, cum Episcopis suis, Sanctus Imperator noster vult facere also cutionem ad istos per me indignum servum suum. Whereupon Sanctissimi Vicarii senioris Romae ixerunt; Sicut ju∣bet Imperium ejus. Bahanis dixit, Hortatorie alloquitur vos Imperator; Homines, , estis? &c. Episcopi Photii dixerunt; Deus custodiat Im∣peratorem nostrum, Verbum petivimus impunitatis, ut diceremus negocia nostra cum fiducia, & non accepimus, (according to the Emperors promise) quantum ergo habe∣mus loqui, &c. After many discourses between Bahanis and them, Bahanis dixit; Per Imperatorem nostrum sanctum nihil prohibemini, jubet enim, vult et acquiescit ut loquamini: Sed viaentes Judices convicia vestra (Judi∣ces dicit Vicarios Papae & Patriarcham, as Binius informs us in his Marginal Note) Episcopi Photii dixerunt; et nos Iudices ipsos non recipimus. After many more discourses, answers and replies between them and Bahanis, speaking in the name and by the command of the Emperor, Photius and his Bishops would by no means sub∣mit to the Judgement of the Pope and Patriarch, or their Delegates, as unfit and partial Judges in this case. 6ly. That Justinian was in truth President and chief Judge in this Synod, not the Popes Legates; as is evident 1. By his Oration in the beginning of this Synod, Action 1. 2ly. By his elegant Oration to Photius, and his Bishops,Surius Tom. 3. p. 538, to 44. and the whole Synod, exhorting them all to Peace, unity, humility and recon∣ciliation, Action 2. & 5. with his Oration to them at the cioze of this Synod, and his & Bahanis Interlocutory Speeches therein recorded, worthy reading, over-long to in∣sert. 3ly. By giving Photius & his Bps. 7. days respite to consider whether they would submit and comply, or not, Action 6. 4ly. By these his memorable Questions pro∣pounded to the Synod and others when they had finished their Canons and Sentences. Quisquis habet aliquid adversus hanc Sanctam et Vniversalem Synodum dicendum, aut contra hujus Canones aut terminum, stet in medio, et quae sibi videntur edicat, sive Episcopus sit, sive quis∣quam de Ecclesiastio Clero, sive Laicus, aut ex iis qui civilibus officiis mancipantur, existat: Licentiam damus omnibus, ut qui in mente habet quid ambiguum de iis, quae decreta sunt in hac sancta Synodo, hoc in medium exhibeat, et suscipiat satisfactione salubre remedium, &c. Qui ergo habet quid dicendum, dicat dum haec celebratur: Nam solu∣ta sancta & universali Synodo, qui apparuerit Ecclesiae Dei contradicens, aut non commu∣nicans ei, sive Episcopus sit, sive absolutè Sacerdos, sive dignitate aliqua praeditus, vel aliqua conversatus, veniam ab Imperio nostro minime consequetur, sed juste condemnabitur, et a civitate nostra pelletur ut corruptor et pe∣stilens, et membrum putridum et inutile, et commune corpus Ec∣clesiae violans. 5ly. When the Acts of this Synod were publikely read, Post Lectio∣nem, Basilius amicus Christi, & magnus Imperator dixit, Dicat nunc quicunque voluerit ex sedentibus in hac sancta et universali Synodo, in quo istorum haesitet vel ambiget, quae nunc lecta sunt. Sancta Synodus ex∣clamavit, Omnibus placent quae lecta sunt; omnes eisdem ipsis concordamus, omnes liben∣ter subscribimus. Item, post lectum ter: inum Synodi, Basilius Imperator ad Sy∣nodum dixit; Dicat nunc Sancta & Universalis Synodus, Si omnibus sanc∣tissimis Episcopis concordantibus ac consentientibus praesens ter∣minus sit depromptus; oportet enim divina quaeque cum universo∣rum
consensu et concordantia in Ecclesiastis praedicari et confir∣mari collegus. Sancta Synodus dixit, Omnes ita sapimus, omnes ita praedicamus; om∣nes concinentes & consentientes prompte subscribimus. Hoc est veritatis judicium, hoc est justitiae decretum, &c. 6ly. By his and the other Emperors approbations and ratifica∣tions of the Acts of this Synod by their Subscriptions in this form, after all the Bi∣shops and their Delegates had subscribed them. Post quos tandem subscripse∣runt Imperatores his verbis. Basilius, Constantinus, & Leo, perpetui Augusti, Christo Deo fideles Principes Romanorum, et magni Imperatores sanctam hanc et universalem Synodum suscipientes, et omnibus quae ab ipsa definita et scripta sunt, concordantibus, subscribimus ma∣nu propria. To which subscription, Benius subjoyns this his observation: In qua subscriptione Imperatorum, hoc obiter advertendum est, quod aiunt quidem, suscipi∣entes et concordantes, non autem definientes; id enim Episcoporum est, non Principum: when as all the premised Presidents of former Councils resolve, that Em∣perors and Kings had the chiefest hand in prescribing, enacting, defining, confirming, as well as receiving and assenting to their Acts and Constitutions; And the Popes Le∣gates presiding and representing his person therein, subscribed only consensi, not de∣finientes,Anastatius in Hadriano 2. p. 139, 140. Cent. Magd. 9. c. 9. col. 439, 440. Zonaras An∣nal. Tom. 3. which the Greek Bishops only used. 7ly. There fell out a Notable difference between the Popes Legates and the Greek and Oriental Bishops, about the form of subscribing the Acts and Canons of this Synod. Cum ad subscriptionem actus esset res de∣ducta, Pontificii deprehendunt, Graecos de suo exemplari de Epistola Nicholai, ea quae de la∣de Imp. Ludovici erant scripta, avulsisse, propterea quod moleste ferrent alii Imperatoris et Caesaris nomen tribui, quam suo Domino: quare oboritur ea de re contentio. Roma∣ni subscribere denegant, nisi illa restituatur. Graeci respondent, in actis Synodalibus non esse de Imp. sed de Solius Domini laude tractandum. Romani autem metuentes sui Pontificis severi∣tatem, indefinite subscribunt;Surius, Tom. 3. p. 543, 544. Ego Donatus Dei gratia Episcopus Ostiensis Ecclesiae, locum obtinens Domini mei Adriani, huic sanctae ac universali Synodo praesidens, usque ad voluntatem ejusdem eximii Praesulis ad omnia ut superius legitur consensi, & manu propria subscripsi.See Suius, p. 531. Eodem modo & alii duo Legati subscripserunt. His peractis, quidam ex Graecorum Episcopis Imperatorem adeunt, & queruntur, per libel∣los, quod initio scribere, juxta formam Pontificis coacti sunt, Con∣stantinopolitanam Ecclesiam plane in potestate Romani Pontificis esse, nec posse unquam libertatem pristinam recuperari, nisi libelli Pontificiis extorqueantur, et sibi reddantur. Agitur ea de re mag∣na contentione cum Pontificiis, ac aegerrime impetratur restitutio. After which Ignatius the restored Patriarch of Constantinople subscripsit sic: Ignatius misericordia Dei Ecclesiae Constantinopoleos, Novae Romae sanctam hanc & univer∣salem Synodum suscipiens, & omnibus quae ab ea judicata & scripta sunt, concordans, & definiens subscripsi manu propria. Eadem forma usi sunt etiam Legati Patriarcha∣rum Orientis; whereby they avoyded the snare they were like to be intangled in by the Popes Legates policy.Cent. Magd. 9. col: 440, 441, 442.

That there fell out another difference and hot con∣test between the Roman Legates and Grecians in this Council, to whose Jurisdi∣ction the Bulgarians (newly converted to the faith) should belong; whether to the Pope and Church of Rome, or the Greek Church and Patriarch of Constantinople? they having GreekZonaras Tom: 3.

Con∣cil. p. 530. Bahanis a Layman bare chief sway. 11ly. That Laurentius Surius himself hath prefixed before his imperfect fragments and Epitome of its Actions, De octavo Synodo admonitio ad Lecto∣rem,
viz. Triplicem Octavam Constantinopoli habitam Synodum, historiae loquuntur. Pri∣mam, in qua praeter fas ejecto Ignatio, repente ex aulico & neophyto creatus est Constanti∣nopolitana Urbis Antistes Photius. Alteram, quae pulso Photio, restituit suae sedi Ignatium. Tertiam, sub Johanne Octavo Romano Pontifice, qui mortuo Ignatio, pacis conciliandae causa Photium Constantinopolitanis Episcopum reddidit. Ex his mediam, docti viri Octa∣vam recte ac merito oecumenicam censent dici oportere, tametsi Graeci quidem aliter sentire videantur, quorum judicia non sunt magni penaenda. Semper enim illi qua∣dam Conci. . mulatione feruntur erga Latinam Ecclesiam, & difficile est morosis ingeniis per omnia satisfacere, &c. Sed iis omissis, hoc te lector admonitum volumus, nos dare quidem in praesentiarum legendam tibi Octavam Synodum, sed ita tamen, ut multa ex ejus Ac∣tionibus desiderentur. Neque enim habuimus exemplar integrum, sed ab illis mu∣tua sumus, qui in compendium & epitomen ipsas Actiones redigere voluerint. Sub finem tamen quaedam adjuximus, ex aliis bona fide collectis, ad eandem Synodum per∣tinentia. 2ly. It is observable, that the true cause of Photius his deposition, and Ignatius his restitution by the Emperor Basilius, and this Synod, was, because Magd. 9. c.  26. Basi∣lius prohibitus fuit a Communione per Photium Patriarcham, propter caedem Michae∣lis Imperatoris; not because he was made Patriarch in his stead, being a meer Cour∣tier and Layman before, against the Canons; St. Ambrose, with sundry others be∣ing made Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, yea Popes, in the Eastern and Western Churches, and England, though mere Laymen and Courtiers when elected; yea after Ignatius his death, Photius was restored to his Patriarchship notwithstanding this ex∣ception. 13ly. It is worthy consideration what advantage Pope Nicholas the 1. and Adrian the 2d made of these schisms and differences between Ignatius and Michael, Photius and Basilius, Patriarchs and Emperors of Constantinople, to advance their own usurped Supremacy over the Greek Emperors and Church, all other Princes, Pre∣lates, and Councils themselves, if their Epistles, Rescripts registred by Gratian and others be genuine, not forged, as many justly repute them. For Pope Ni∣cholas in his Letters to the Emperor Michael, upon the complaint of Ignatius, that he was unjustly deposed by the Emperor, took upon him not only most insolently to revile, check, and trample upon the Emperor Michael, but likewise to inlarge his own Papal power beyond all bounds, and to deny, abridge, abolish the Empe∣rors antient Ecclesiastical Right and Jurisdiction:Rescripta Ni∣cholai Papae 1. ex Gratiani vo∣lumine in unum collecta per Joan: Co∣chlaem. Surius Concil. Tom. 3. p. 512, 513 514, 531, 533, 537. averring, 1. That Popes have an Universal Jurisdiction over all Patriarchs, Archbishops, and Bishops, to receive appeals from, and restore them to their Sees whereof they were deprived, either by Emperors, Kings or Councils, by their Papal authority. 2. That Popes have power to summon General, National or Provincial Synods for this purpose, without Emperors or Kings assents; and to enjoyn Emperors to suppresse all Councils, Synods enacting any thing to the prejudice of the Pope or Church of Rome, as meer wicked Conventicles. 3ly. That Emperors, Kings, or Laymen ought not to be present, much lesse to preside in any Synods or Councils where Ecclesiastical matters are debated, nor have any authority to intermeddle with, or to make Lawes, Constitutions for the Church or Clergy, but only Popes and Bishops. 4ly. That Emperors and Kings have no right, power to judge or dethrone Popes, Bishops, or other Cler∣gy-men, for any crimes, nor yet to elect, promote, constitute Bishops, or confer Bishopricks, but only Popes and their Delegates. 5ly. That Popes may judge, excommunicate, depose, Emperors, Kings and other Laymen. 7ly. That the Jurisdiction, power, office of Emperors and Kings, is confined by God and Christ, only to worldly or secular, not extended to Ecclesi∣astical, religious, or divine affairs, which belong wholly and solely to Popes, Bishops, and Church-men. 7ly. That Popes and Prelates by their Canons and Constitutions may repeal, null, controll the Lawes, Edicts of Kings, or Emperors; but they can neither null nor repeal their Canons, Constitutions, nor act ought against them. These with other Antichristian Paradoxes Pope Adrian broached, decreed, upon the score of Ignatius, and his suc∣cessors have since incorporated them into the body of their Canon Lawes.

After the death of Carous Calvus,Ano 878 Pope John the 9th. intended to make and Crown Ludovicus Balbus Emperor, but the Senate and Citizens of Rome standing for Carolus Crassus, against the bribed Pope, who persisted obstinate, they thereupon cast him into prison, from whence he escaping, fled into France for succour, and there Crowned Ludovicus Balbus Emperor: Charles in the mean time seising upon Rome, called the Pope out of France to Rome by menaces; who returning thither upon his summons, crowned Charles Emperor in Rome, to purchase his peace with him, that so he might safely reside there. An Argument of his Supremacy over this Pope.

Ita paulatim sese Pontifices Imperatorum potestate exuerunt, ut facilius eos tum demum contererent pedibus. Sed eo foelicius provenit Ecclesiae & Urbi, quod in tam male acquisito Papatu, diutius non duraverit; writes Balaeus, he dying within 13. months after.

Pope Hadrian the 3d. statim post initum Pontificatum nactus opportunitatem,Anno 884 per Caroli Crassi absentiam, qui tunc exercitum ab Italia in Normannos diripientes Galliam eduxerat; encouraged by his predecessors Usurpations upon the Emperors antient right in the election and confirmation of Popes, proceeded one step further, utterly to abolish it for the future. Tantae audaciae & supercilii fuit, ut mox adepto Papatu, De∣cretum faceret, ut in creando Pontifice, non amplius expectaretur Imperatoris au∣thoritas, sed ut Romae semper essent libera & Cleri & popul. suffragia. If we believe Gratian, this Decree of his (or another after it) extended further, even to deprive all Emperors & Kings of their rights in electing, promoting, or confirming any Bishops: Gratian Di∣stinctio 6. Nullus Laicorum Principum vel ptntum semet inserat electioni aut promotioni Patriar∣chae, Metropolitae, aut cujuslibet Episcopi, n videlicet inordinata & incongrua fiat electio, vel confusio, vel contentio: praesertim cum nullam in talibus potestatem quemque potestati∣vorum vel caeterorum Laicorum habre convenia: & infra. Quisquis saecularium Prin∣cipum vel potentum vel alterius dignitatis Laicus adversus communem consonantem at{que} Canonicam electioem Ecclesiastici ordinis agere tentaverit, anathema sit, donec obediat & consentiat quicquid Ecclsia de electio & ordinatione proprii praesulis se velle monstrave∣rit. From this Antichristian Decree, controuling the practie of the Church, and re∣voking the undoubted right both of Emperors, Kings, Princes, and Lay-men, in the election of Bishops in all preceding ages, Crantzius (and Balaeus out of him) observes; Sic ausi sunt Pontifices ac Romanorum improbitas, Imperatores suos contemnere dum Imperii virtus elangueret: Unde quod antecessores sui multis am annis partu∣rierant, ipse uno foetu edito, in lucem protulit. Porro hanc rem tentavit Prior Nicholaus pri∣mus: sed ad effectum, ut ipsi loquuntur, non perduxit. At{que} hic perpende , quomodo per hoc Decretum, jus Imperatoribus omne quod in Pontificem atque Vrbem Romanam habuere, sit ademptum: Ita ut in hoc foetu Pontifices magno cum Triumpho, superiores ac victores evaserint. Videbis eos adhuc majora tentare, & non cessare donec sese extulerint super omne quod dicitur Deus, aut quod colitur, 2 Thes. 2. ut dicant ejus adoratores, Quis similis bestiae? aut quis poterit pugnare cum ea?

(as in the Council of Paris,Here p 191, 192. forecited.)

Therefore Earls, Noble men, and other  acknowledgment, had then, and fre∣quently before this  voyce and consent with Archbishops, Bishops, Abbs, Priests, in  in aking Ecclesiastical Laws and Canons, to which the Emperor assented,  them valid and obligatory.

The Emperor hereupon sent to Nicholas the Patriarch, ut se reciperet &  eximeret; quem cum , ne{que} ulla ratione exorare posset: statim è Regia navi transvehendum, atque ind pedestri itinere in Galacrenaeum Monasterium, curat. Ejus vero loco Patriarcha designatus est Syngelus Euthymius, , qui  studio obstitit, ne  ab In peratore promulgaretur, ut ipsius exemplo, secundam, tertiam, & quatam etiam uxorem ducere. After this Empe∣rors death, Alexander who succeeded , restored Nicholas, and deposed, ba∣nished Ethymius the Patriarch. It is observable, that within the space of 40. year; in this age, the Emperor of Constantinople deposed, imprisoned, banished no lesse then . patriarchs one after another, for presuming to oppose or excommunicate their, though they contested with the Pope of Rome for Supremacy, and held them∣selves as universal and omnipotent as the Roman Pontiffs.

After 3. dayes fasting and prayers for the Emperor & Coun∣cils good success; The Emperor, pergens ad Palacium, Regale sedit solium, indutus veste splendidissima, quam texit sapientia, repletus est prudentia, erectus & potentia, tractans
practice de statu Regni, & theorice de ordine & stabilitate Ecclesiarum Christi, & quali∣ter boni quiete viverent, & mali inulte non peccarent. Episcoporum sacer conventus, inter alia quibus divina & humana tractaturi erant, communi voto & pari consensu, de collegio sanctorum Sacerdotum graves & idoneos direxerunt mediatores ad praefatum pium Regem, inquirentes, quo studio, & quali benignitate, secundum sapientiam & possibilitatem ab ipse Deo sibi datam, Ecclesiam Christi, illi per Regalem potestatem, & ipsis per Sacer∣dotalem eminentiam commissam, defendere, & ministerium illorum amplificare & subli∣mare dignaretur; proponentes ei propriam Regis eminentiam, id est, ut misericordia & mode∣stia omnes praecellat. After which the Emperor made an Oration to the Bishops & Cler∣gy, admonishing them of, and enjoyning them to perform their Pastoral duties with all diligence; which they performing, Haberetis me omnibus Ecclesiae Christi adversan∣tibus, & vestro Sacerdotali ministerio renitentibus, oppositissimum bellatorem, &c. Upon report of the Emperors Speech to the Council, all the Clergy and Nobility standing up, blessed God, prayed for Arnulphus his long life, and sung Te Deum Laudamus, glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ, qui Ecclesiae suae sanctae tam piam & mitem censolato∣rem, tam{que} strenuum adjutorem ad honorem nominis sui condonare dignatus est. Some of the Canons concerning excommunicated persons contemning the censures of the Church, were made by this Emperors special direction and command, and all of them approved as well by consent and approbation of the Nobility and Laity, as of the Bishops and Clergy, several of the Laws being Temporal, intermixed with the Ecclesiastical. After Pope Hadrian the 3d. had deprived the Emperors of their antient right in electing and confirming Popes,Anno 892, to 900. there arose sundry schisms, seditions, factions, cor∣ruptions in their elections and installments, till this their right was restored to them by Pope Leo the 8.

Theodora scortum impudens & Romanae Urbis Domina, veneris calore succensa, eum ob mutuas scortationes Bononien∣sem Episcopum primo, Ravennae Archiepiscopum secundo, & tertio (ut sic insano ejus amore commodius fruiretur) Romanum Papam fecit. At last he was apprehended in Rome by the Souldiers of Guido Marquesse of Thuscia, Anno Dom. 928. cast into prison, & cervicale super os ejus injecto suffocatur, to set up Theodoraes daughters Bastard son. Quo mortuo, Marozia filium Johannem 12. quem ex Sergio Papa meretrix ipsa genuerat, Papam constituerunt. Sed quia Romanus Clerus & populus in ejus electionem non consenerant, eodem anno est iterum depositus, & in maximo Civium tumultu, Leo sextus in ejus locum suffectus: Qui statim post septimum ejus regiminis mensem. Anno Dom. 930. veneno sublatus à Marozia fertur, ut surio locum daret.

Pope Stephanus the 8. ita civilibus Romanorum seditionibus vexatus fuit, ut nil memoria dignum ab eo geri potu∣erit. In populari enim tumultu tam turpiter mutilatus erat, ac cicatricum deformitate signatus, ut puduerit eum postea in publicum prodire. Adeo sancti tunc temporis Papae fuerunt, ut eorum oves nulla sanctitatis, aut beatitudinis (aut superioritatis) ipsorum habita ratione, eos vulneribus afficerent: he dyed ingloriously Anno 944. During all this space the Emperors by reason of their intestine Wars, and Competitors for the Empire, were disabled to claim or exercise their antient Imperial Jurisdiction at Rome, in the election, confirmation, correction and deposition of these wicked scandalous Popes, who were for theBaronius An∣nal.

Helduinus Episcopus Tungrensis Ecclesiae,Anno 920 about the year 920. against his Alle∣giance, revolting from King Charles the 3. of France, to Henry his Enemy, by great sums of money given to him and his followers, procured a grant of this Bishoprick from him, who by force and menaces enforced Archbishop Herimannus to consecrate him, procuring sundry Clerks and Laymen likewise to swear, That King Charles had conferred this Bishoprick upon him: Whereupon King Charles writ a Letter to the Bishops of his Realm against this intruder: Qui contra Regalem agens potestatem, con∣tra quoque Apostoli dicta ubi dicitur, Deum timete, Regem honorificate; Et, Qui potestati resistit, Dei ordinationi resistit; non est enim potestas nisi a Deo: Et adversus cytharedi David dicta, ubi ad Dominum loquitur; Imposuisti homines super capita no∣stra: Quique ultra Rhenum ad inimicos nostros proficiscens, minimeque reminiscens Sa∣cramentorum suorum nobis promissorum, eaque retro deorsum abjiciens, ab Henrico inimico nostro Episcopatum Tungrensis Ecclesiae expetivit, sua{que} damnatione contra omnia sta∣tuta tam sacrorum patrum quam Regum, viz. antecessorum nostro∣rum usurpavit, &c. commanding them to ordain Ruherus Bishop in his place, upon the petition of the Laity and Clergy of that Church to the King, whom they had una∣nimously elected by his License, which they did accordingly. Pope John the 10. in his Epistle to Herimannus Archbishop of Colen, affirmed that this forcible intrusion and consecration of Helduinus into this Bishoprick, absque Clericorum electione & Laico∣rum acclamatione, and Kings assent, was illegal, and against the Apostles rule, Lay hands suddenly on noman; cum prisca consuetudo vigeat, qualiter nullus alicui Clerici Episcopatum conferre debeat, nisi Rex, cui divinitus sceptra collata sunt. Concluding, Quia nos Caroli Regis decus nullo modo auferre volumus, sed pro vigore atque dilectione vel consanguinita∣te nostri dilecti filii Berengarii gloriosissimi Imperatoris, ut prior an∣tecessorum suorum Regum mos fuit, eum ita illibatam atque incon∣cussam
Dominationem obtinere delectamur: et sicut Priores suos antecessores nostrorum antecessorum authoritate, Episcopum per unamquamque Parochiam ordinare probabiliter statutum est, ita ut Carolus Rex faciat confirmando jubemus. A clear Papal concession and ra∣tification of this their Royal prerogative of conferring Bishopricks. After the death of Seulfus Archbishop of Rhemes,Anno 938, &c. Flodoardus hist. Eccles.

Herebertus Earl of Aquitaine coming to Rhemes perswaded the Clergy and people to elect Hugo his sonne (not a∣bove 5 years old) for their Bishop; and sent to Rodulphus King of Burgundy to confirm his election by his authority; who thereupon by advice of some Bishops, Remensem Episcopatum committit Hereberto (Comiti) aequitatis censura disponendum at{que} regendum ab ipso: Qui etiam legatos Ecclesiae, cum Abbone praesule Romam mit∣tere satagit, hujus electionis decretum secum ferentis, & assensum Papae super eum petentes. Johannes itaque Papa interveniente Abbone presule, petitioni corum assensum praebens, Episcopium Remense Abboni Episcopo delegat, quae sunt Episcopalis ministerii ab ipso in eodem Episcopio tractanda & sirmanda decernens. Abbo being Guardian only of the spiritualties, and Count Herebertus of the temporalties during Hughs minority; the Earl by force of arms turned many Clerks and Laymen out of their benefices and pos∣sessions belonging to the Archbishoprick, disposing of them prolibitu suae voluntatis, quibuscun{que} placuerit; A tumult arising thereupon, his souldiers slew two Canons in the Cloisters of the Church; After which he called a Synod of 6. Bishops of the Province of Rhemes, apud Trosteium, Anno 927. Rege tamen Rodulpho contradicente, In the mean time, Pope John being apprehended and kept Prisoner by Wido, and King Ro∣dolph falling out with Herebertus, Rodulphus Rex literas Remis mittit, ad Clerum & populum, pro electione Praesulis celibranda: ad quas illi respondent, id agere se non posse, salvo suo electo, (to wit, Hugh the infant) & electione quam fecerant, permanente. The K. thereupon besieged Rhemes 3. weeks, then being admitted into it, Conjunctis igitur sibi nonnullis Episcopis ex Francia & Burgundia, facit ordinari hac in sede Artol∣dum quendam ex eoenobio sancti Remigii monachum, without any election, by his own regal authority; who above one year after received his Pall from Pope John. Ar∣toldus excommunicating Herebertus for invading and detaining some Towns belong∣ing to his Church, Anno 940. thereupon Herebertus with his friends and certain Bishops, wasted the villages which belonged to the Bishoprick, with fire and sword, besieged and took Rhemes, then by perswasions of friends and menaces forced Artoldus Episcopii se precuratione vel potestate abdicare, and to accept of the Abbey of Saint Basol in lieu thereof: which done, they consecrated and installed Hugh for their Bishop, asserentibus, fautoribus ejus, quod Artoldus, nequaquam electus, sed per violentiam fuerit intromissus, sese{que} Episcopali abdicaverit ditione; Soon after the Le∣gates of Rhemes bringing Hugo a Pall from Pope Stephen, Artoldus breaking all his forced agreements with Hugh and Herbert, repaired to King Ludovicus, to whom he complained of the injury; who thereupon besieged Rhemes so long, that Archbp. Hugh unable to hold out, or make any composition without quitting his Archbishoprick, secretly departed the City after 3. dayes siege, to avoid the putting out his eyes, if taken prisoner.Anno 547 Sic{que} Reges cum Episcopis & Principibus ingredientes Urbem, Dominum Artoldum Praesulem, qui dudum fuerat ejectus, iterum inthronizari fecerunt; quem Rober∣tus Trevirensis Archiepiscopus, & Fred. Moguntiacensis accipientes utraque manu ei∣dem sedi restituerunt. After which, to end the differences between these Competitors, Synodus postea Verduni habetur, where sundry Archbishops, Bishops and Abbots assem∣bled to that end;Anno 94 ad quam Hugo evocatus, nissis quoque duobus ad eum deducendum E∣piscopis, venire noluit. Upon which contempt, Ʋniversa Synodus Artoldo Remense regendum decernit Episcopium. Soon after Indicitur Synodus, quae & convenit in Ec∣clesiam Sancti Petri in prospectu Mosomi, ex Diocaesi Trevirensi at{que} Remensi. Veni∣ens autem illuc Hugo Praesul, & locu us cum Rotberto Archiepiscopo, Synodum noluit ingredi.Agapit. 2 Literas vero quasdam er nomine Agapeti Papae misit ad Episcopos per Clericum suum, qui eas Roma detulerat, nihil auctoritatis canonicae continentes, sed hoc tantum praecipientes, ut Hugoni Remense redderetur Epis∣copium. Quibus lectis, responderunt Episcopi, non esse dignum vel congruum, ut Apostolicae Legationis mandatum, quod dudum Rotbertus Archiepiscopus, deferente Frederico Magontiacensi Praesule coram Regibus, et Episcopis susceperat, intermitterent
propter has literas quae insidiator, aemulus Artoldi Praesulis exhi∣bebat: immo quod regulariter caeperant Canonice pertractaretur. Sicque praecipitur recitari capitulum xix. Carthaginensis Concilii de accusato & accusatore. Quo recitato, dijudicatum est juxta diffinitionem hujus Capituli, ut Artoldo communionem et Parochiam Remensem retinente, Hugo qui ad duas jam Synodes evocatus venire centempsrat, à communione & regimine Remensis Episcopii ab∣stinert, donec ad universalem Synodum sese purgaturus occurreret. Ipsum{que} Capitulum mex in Charta describi feceruat Episcopi coram se, subnectentes hanc etiam diffinitionem suam, & eidem Hugoni miserunt. Qui post alteram diem eamdem Chartam Rotberto Pontifici remisit, hoc verbis remandans, quod ipsorum judicio nequaquam obedi∣turus esset. Interea literae proclamationis Artoldi Praesulis ad Romanam diriguntur sedem Dominus igitur Agapitus Papa, Vicarium suum Marinum Episcopum misit ad Othonem Regem, propter evocandum et aggregandum generalem Synodum, (as proper only for the Emperor to summon.) Literae quoque ipsius Papae mittuntur ab Urbe quibusdam speciatim Episcopis, vocantes eos ad eandem Synodum Congregato, deni∣que Synodo in Pallatio Engulenheim, recitata sunt haec quae sequuntur coram Regi∣bus et Episcopis,Hermannus Contractus, An. 948. Otto Frisingensis, l. 6. c. 19. Anno 1248. present therein. This general Synod being assembled, all the premises concerning Artoldus and Hugo, with the Popes Letter, commanding Hugh to be restored, were read before them. The Synod upon debate passed the same sentence for Artoldus against Hugo, notwithstanding the Popes Letter, as the last Synod did, approving their sentence, and excommunicating Hugo. From this Hi∣story I shall observe; 1. That the Archbishops of Rhemes were usually elected by the Clergy and people, but yet by the Kings license, who had a power to confirm or reject the person elected. 2ly. That the Kings of France, in special cases, did con∣ferre Bishopricks on whom they pleased, without any precedent election by the Clergy and people. 3ly That they committed the Temporalties of Bishopricks to Noblemen and others, during the vacancy of the Sees, or Minority of the Bishop. 4ly. That they had a just power to remove Bishops unduly elected, or forcibly in∣truded into Bishopricks, even by force of armes when necessary. 5ly. That both the Kings of France, and successive Synods, reproved, condemned the Popes own Letters as Un-canonical, and gave sentence against them, which sentence was afterwards ap∣proved by a General Synod. 6ly. That Kings may and ought to remove unfitting or scandalous Bishops, notwithstanding the Popes Bulls, Palls, Mandates to confirm, or continue them. 7ly. That no Synods ought to be summoned, but by Kings, or their Authority within their Realms; and that if any be otherwise called by Popes, Arch∣bishops, or others, they may and ought to prohibit them, and their Bishops resort unto them. This is evident by the antient memorable Inhibition of Sigebertus King of France, to Desiderius Cadurcensis Episcopus, in this his Letter directed to him.

Pope Agapet the 2. and after his death others stile him, partim muneribus, partim minis, mans, sent solonm Legates to the Emperor portuning and adjuring him, ut italiam tyrannide vindicaret; who thereupon marching into Italy with an them, entred Rome, conquering all who resisted him; and enjoyned Crown him Emperor; which he performing, before his return home, the Popes fidelity towards him, & Alberti partes nunqua  esset secuturus. No sooner was he returned into Germani, but the Pope presently violating his Oath, received Albertue into Rome and his pastoral duty, in co officio non Papalite, omni voluptatum & venationibus, ludicris, ludis, aliis{que} slagitiis ab ipsa adol ratorem hortarentur, ut reversus, ruinae totius Ecclesiae & Politiae subveniret; Hereupon this good Emperor returning towards Rome,  Papam pro suis sceleribus ar∣guens, monet cum sui officii, dum adhuc est in  verum lapiai verbasiua, cum corrigere potuit. Whereupon, Anno 963. the Emperor marched from Papia to Rome with a great Army, pro sceleribus Papae Johannis dijudicandis; The Pope conscious of his own guilt, together with Albertus, fled thence to the hiding himself in the woods amongst the wild beasts for a time. The Romans ope∣ning their gates, received the Emperor without resistance; who upon the Complaints of the Clergy and people against this Monster of men Pope John, sum∣moned a Council of several Bishops, Cardinals, Priests out of Italy, France, Germany and other parts, and of sundry Nobles, Senators, Chief Officers, certain Commo∣ners, and Military Officers of Rome, (mentioned by name in Luitprandus, who at large relates the proceeding in this Council against the Pope:) Wherein the Empe∣ror sitting as President, demanded of the Council, who the Pope declared to be pre∣sent in so holy and famous a Council, to which he was summoned? Pontifices & Cardinales, Presbyteri  Dacom, cum universa plebe diverunt, Mi∣ramur sanctissimam prudentiam vestram, nos hoc velle peroari, quod noc Babylonicos, nec Indicos . Nam hic jam e illis ed, qui veriunt in v∣mentis ovium, intus autem sum ; ita apertè savis, ita  per∣tractat negotia, ut nihil circuitioni utatur. Imperator respondit, ue accusatio es nominatim exprimantur: deinde quod agendum est, pertractetur. Tunc consurg Petrus Cardinalis, Presbyter, se celebrasse, & non communicatie, testatus ed. Johannes Episcopus  Jo∣hannes Cardinalis Diaconus,  Diaconum ordinasse in equorum non certis temporibus, sunt prosei. Benedictus, byteris dixit, se scire, quod ordinationes Episcoporum preo faceret; & quod an∣norum decem Episcopum in Tudertina Civitatu  De Sacrilego non esse necesse percontari, dixit, quia plus videndo, quam adulterio dixerunt, quod oculis non viderant, sed & Stephanam Patris Concubinam, &  absum este, & Sanctum Palatium lupanar et prostibulum fecisse: Venationem dixerunt publicae exercuisse; Benedictum  & mox mortuum esse. Johannem Cardinalem ubdiaconum  incendia fe∣cisse, ense accinctum, galea & lor candurum fuisse,  sunt. Diaboli in amo∣rem vinum bibisse, omnes tam Clerici quam Laici acclamarunt. In ludo Jovis, Veneris, caeterorumque Demonum & canonicas horas eum non celebrasse, nec signo  sunt Hisce criminibus adjiciuntur, quod juramentum imperatori, supra ipsam Corpus Petri praestitum, non servaret, quod aureas  &  Sancti Petri, scortis distribuerit; quod Zacheum, virum reprobatum, divinarum atque humanarum e∣rarum inscius, consecravit Episcopum, & Ungariis destinarit, ut suis concionibus ipsos contra Imperatorem instigaret. The truth whereof they all attested, under pain of being accursed and condemned by Christ in the great day of Judgement, and that there were as many Witnesses of his crimes, as there were souldiers in the Em∣perors Army. Hereupon he was summoned by the Emperors Letters to answer these crimes inserted into the summons; but the Messengers not finding him (he hi∣ding
himself in woods) after a treble search and summons; thereupon the Empe∣ror, as President, said, Expectavimus adventum ejus, ut praesente eo quod nobis egerit quaereremus, verum quoniam eum non affuturum certo scimus, quam perfi∣de nobiscum egerit, ut diligenter agnoscatis etiam atque etiam flagitamus. Notum itaque vobis facimus, Archiepiscopis, Presbyteris, Diaconis, reliquoque Clero, nec∣non et Comitibus, Iudicibus, omnique plebi, quod idem Johannes Papa oppres∣sus a Berengario, atque Adelberto, rebellibus nostris, misit nobis in Sexoniam nun∣cios, rogans, ut pro amore Dei in Italiam veniremus, & Ecclesiam Sancti Petri, ac seipsum ex saucibus eorum liberaremus. Nos vero, adjuvante Deo, quantum fece∣rimus, non est necesse dicere, ut in praesentiarum, videtis. Ereptus vero mea ope∣ra ex eorum manibus, & honori debito restitutus, oblitus juramenti et fidelitatis quam mihi supra corpus S. Petri promisit; eundem Adelbertum Roman venire fecit, & contra me defendit, seditiones fecit: & videntibus nostris Militibus, Dux belli factus, lorica & galea est indutus. Quid super hoc sancta Synodus decernat, edicat? Whereupon, Ad haec Romani Pontifices, reliquus Clerus, et cunctus populus dixerunt, Inauditum vulnus inaudito est cauterio exurendum. Si corruptis moribus sibi soli, & non cunctis obesset, quoquo modo tolerandus esset. Quot prius Casti, hujus facti sunt imitatione incaesti? Quot probi, hujus exemplo conversationis sunt reprobi? Petimus itaque magnitudinem Imperii vestri, monstrum illud nulla virtute redemptum a vitiis, a Sancta Ecclesia Roma∣na pelli, aliumque loco ejus constitui, qui nobis exemplo bonae con∣versationis praeesse valeat, et prodesse sibi: recte vivat, ac bene vivendi nobis exemplum praebeat. Tunc Imperator. Placet inquit, quod dicitis: nihilque gratius nobis, quam ut talis, qui huic sanctae et universali sedi praeponatur, inveniri possit. His dictis, omnes una voce dixerunt: Leo∣nem venerabilem sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Protoscriniarium, virum approbatum, ad summum Sacerdotii gradum nobis in Pastorem eligimus, ut sit summus & universalis Papa Romanae Ecclesiae, reprobato ob improbos mores Ioanne Apostata. Quum haec omnes tertio dixissent, annuente Imperatore, nominatum Leonem ad Lateranense Palatium, secundum consuetudinem, cum laudibus ducunt: & certo tempore in Ecclesia Sancti Petri (Leonem adhuc Laicum, as some record) ad sum∣mum Sacerdotium sancta consecratione attollunt, & fideles se ei affuturos, jure∣jurando promittuut. Pope John thus legally deposed, Minime sibi quiescendum pu∣tabat, sed simulc intelligebat, Othonem praesidium quod penes se in urbe fuerat, de∣misisse, ne populum Romanum minime gravaret; mox Proceres Romanos clande∣stinis literis solicitat, ut Imperatorem et ipsum quoque Leonem de medio tollant, ut jugum Caesareum excuterent, ut qui parva hominum manu stipatus esset: deinde lar∣gissime promisit, se ipsis omnes Ecclesiae the sauros sponte traditurum & concessurum esse. Hac ampla spe inescati perdi Romani, rem mota seditione quamprimum ag∣grediuntur. Milites vero Imperatoris summa alacritate arma capientes, tantam stra∣gem in seditiosorum cohorte edunt, ut ipse Imperator, misericordia erga sceleratos affectus, receptui caneret, vindictamque militum coerceret. Not long after, the Emperor departing from Rome, this lecherous, treacherous Pope, Meretrices plu∣res, easque genere non ignobiles, cum quibus commercium habuerat, by his secret messages and instigations, Nobiles Romanos concitaverunt, promissis Ecclesiarum thesauris, ut Iohannem rursus in Urbem reciperent, & Leonem comprehensum de medio tollerent. Quod & ipsi statim fecerunt, dejecto Leone quem Caesar crea∣verat: qui mirabiliter tamen evasit carnificum manus, atque ad Imperatorem confu∣git. Iohannes sanctissimus scortorum leno votis potitus, caput sanctae Romanae Ec∣clesiae constituitur. Sede occupata, Iohanni Diacono Cardinali manum amputat: A∣zorio Scriniario linguam praecidit, duos digitos amputat, & nares ei mutilat. O Apo∣stolici Apostolica prorsus facinora! Then calling a Synod of his own Creatures at Rome, Ille Synodo collecta Leonem deposuit, & ejus gesta cassavit, statutumque est, ab Othone Imperatore & Leone habitam, non nominandam Synodum, sed prostibu∣lum faciens adulteris. Quicunque ergo a Leone ordinati sunt, privantur ho∣nore quem ab ipso acceperunt; jussique sunt eorum proscriptionem praesentare in charcula, haec continente; Pater meus nihil sibi habuit, nihil mihi dedit: et sic depositi remansecunt in illis gradibus quos habuerunt antequam a  ordinati. The Empe∣ror informed of these proceedings, marched with his Army towards Rome to chastise
the seditious, treacherous Romans, and depose this lecherous Pope; but before his arrival there, Iohannes Papa se cum uxore cujusdam oblectans, a Diabolo in tem∣pore percutitur; (as Radulphus de Diceto and others story; though some relate it was by her husband) & sine Viatico Dominico obiit, dignas sceleratistimae vitae dans poenas; & ut vitae moribus, exitus justo Dei judicio responderet. The seditious Romans after his death,Anno 963 pristinam libertatem spirantes, cum jam Imperatorem armatum,Fasciculus Tem∣porum, Platina, Steila, Onu∣phrius, Balaeus, Barnes, Cent. Magd. 10. c. 9, 10.

Hac contumelia ac perfidia graviter offensus Im∣perator, primum obsessam & duriter pressam Civitatem, cogit facere deditionem; at∣que de paucis supplicium sumit. Postea Synodum Romae absque mora cogit, multis Episcopis, Abbatibus, Sacerdotibus, Clericis, Monachis, et praecipuis er populo praesentibus, in Ecclesia Lateranensi: In which Synod Pope Leo being resto∣red to his See, sitting with the Emperor, (to whose hands Pope Benedict the 5. was delivered up) by the Emperors command, advenit Benedictus Apostolicae sedis inva∣sor, eorum qui se eligerant, manibus adductus, Pontificalibus vestibus indutus. Quem Benedictus Cardinalis Archidiaconus, tali est Sermone aggressus. Qua tibi authoritate, quave lege, O invasor, haec pontificalia indumenta usurpasti, superstite hoc praesente Domino nostro, venerabili Papa Leone, quem tu nobiscum, accusato & repro∣bato Iohanne, ad Apostolicatus culmen eligisti? Num inficiari potes praesenti Domino Imp: juramento promisisse, unquam te cum saeteris Romanum Papam ele∣cturum, aut ordinaturum absque illius filiique sui Regis Otthonis consensu? Benedictus respondit, Si quid peccavi, miseremim mei. Tunc Imperator effusis la∣chrymis, quam misericors esset ostendens, rogavit Synodum, Ne Benedicto praejudi∣cium fieret: si vellet et posset, ad interrogata responderet: quod si non posset, aut nollet, ac se culpabilem redderet, tamen pro timore Dei misericordiam aliquam in∣veniret. Quo audito, ad Domini Leonis Papae pedes, ipsiusque Imperatoris, idem Benedictus concite procidens, Se peccasse, seque Sanctae Romanae sedis invasorent esse acclamavit: post haec pallium sibi abstulit, quod simul cum Pontificali ferula, quam manu gestabat, Domino Papae Leoni reddidit. Quam ferulam idem Papa sregir, & fractam populo ostendit. Deinde Benedictum in terra sedere praecepit, cui Casulam, quam Planetam vocant, cum Stola pariter abstulit; post autem omnibus Episcopis dixit, Benedictum Sanctae & Apostolicae sedis Romanae invasorem, omni Pontificatus et Presbyteratus honore privamus: ob eleemosynam vero Domini Imperatoris Ot∣thonis, cujus sumus opera in sedem debitam restituti, Diaconatus eum ordinem habere permittimus, et non jam Romae, sed in exilium destinamus. uit autem ablegatus Benedictus Hamburgum, ubi in exio vitam finivit. Porro in hoc Concilio, de jure eligendi Pontificem, deque bonis Imperatoris in Italia actum est.

This Decree of Pope Leo, is prefaced byDistinct. 63. Item Leo Papa. Gratian himself with this Ru∣brick, Electio Romani Pontificis ad Ius pertinet Imperatoris, and incor∣porated into the body of the Canon Law, authorized by sundry Popes: Which being made, ratified by two famous Popes, Adrian and Leo, in two Councils held in
Rome it self, with the suffrage and unanimous consent of all the Clergy. Senators, Officers and People of Rome in a most solemn manner, and the violators thereof subjected to such severe Ecclesiastical and Civil punishments, to prevent all future Schisms, seditions, symonaical contracts, indirect practises, and interpositions of pre∣valent infamous Whores, and Strumpets in the election of Popes, for the peace, ho∣nour, benefit of the whole Church, no succeeding Popes had any power at all to null or revoke by their Pontifical usurped power upon any pretext, without the con∣current authority at least of a General Council, and universal consent of all the Clergy, Senators, and people of Rome, asDefensoris Pacis, l. 2 25. Marsilius Patavinus proves at large. Distinctio Sect. Apost∣cam, et A. Bartholomeus Buxiensis, and Dr. Thierry in their Glosse upon this Decree, in Gratian, demand this Question: Cum haec privilegia fuerint omnibus (Imperatoris) successoribus data, quare non utuntur eis? To which they return these unsatisfactory Answers: Quia Imperator eis renunciavit: A grosse mistake, since no Emperor since the reign of Otho ever renounced it by any Charter: and Gratians conclusion, Ex istis Constitutionibus & pacto Ludovici Imperatoris, deprehenduntur Impratores renunciasse privilegiis quae de electione Summi Pontificis Adrianus Papa Carolo Impera∣tori, & ad imitationem ejus, Leo Papa Ottonis primo Regi Theutonicorum fecerat, is but a meer Nonsequitur, contradicted by his prmises; whereupon they subjoyn these ensuing answers, Item, quia per abusum ea pediderunt: (without expressing a∣ny abuse, the Roman Clergy, people, and Cardinals since having much more for feited their right to elect Popes, for their manifold abuses therein, recorded by sun∣dry Historians) Item, quia ex causa furint eis concessa, unde cessante causa ipsa, cessa∣verunt. Nec obstat quod hic dicitur de successoribus; quia hoc intelligendum est de illis successoribus, qui hoc impetrare possunt: A pretry equivocating evasion worthy Popes and Popish Canonists. They further propound this second question on this Popes Decree: Nunquid Papa posset Imperatori potestatem dare, ut deponeret ipsum? Which they thus affirmatively resolve: Sic, in Haresi, (therefore a Pope may be an He∣retick, and deposed for Heresie by the Emperor;) et de consensu Cardinalium: immo, in omnibus se potest subjicere ei; Therefore the Emperor in all things is superiour to the Pope, not the Pope to him; since this Pope Leo by his Bull and Charter resigned, regranted to this Emperor Otho, not only the Right of elect∣ing and confirming Popes, and the Investitures of Bishops, but also what ever Lands, Cities, Territories, Possessio, Gifts, either Charles or Pipin, or Justinian, or A∣ripert had given of the Regalities of the Kingdom of Italy, or the Empire to St. Peter, or the Church of Rome: which Bull or Charter is recorded at large inDe Privi.

conent of the Emperor; and further, with the consent of the Cardinals, Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, yea, of the whole Clergy and people of Rome, he remised, regran∣ted, resigned to Otho, and his Successors, the whole Donations in Italy, which were formerly made to the Roman Church, by Justinian, Pipin, Charles, and others: So as (by their resolutions) these Decrees and Charters of Leo remain unquestio∣nable, and cannot be evaded. Pope Leo deceasing,Anno 970 the Roman An. 970. dispatched two Embassadors to the Emperour to crave his license to elect a Pope;Aventinus Annal. l. 4. Continuat Reginons Cent.

Sed vereor ne talia fuerunt Benedicti merita, quale praemium à Cynthio consecutus est. Doubtles these 2.

(whom the Romans had elected and made Pope in his absence) that Joannem paratis praesidiis caepit, oculis privavit, carcere inclusit, fame necavit, occupa∣vitque rursus Pontificiam sedem; But dying soon after, the people were so enraged a∣gainst him, that they would not suffer his corps to be buried; but cadaver ejus fune ad pedes alligato, per plateas tractum, ac lanceis & contis opprobriose confossum, à Clericis beneficio sepulturae populari tralitum est.

A strong Argument against his Supremacy over Emperors and Kings, since thus imprisoned, corrected for his vices, by the very Clergy and people of Rome themselves, (never questioned for their proceedings against him;) who likewise forced his Successor Iohn the 17. to retire and exile himself from Rome for a time.

Duke Charles his brother clai∣med the Crown as next heir, but Hugo Caepet obtaining it by power, Charles seised upon the City of Rhemes by the treachery of his Nephew Arnulphus Archbishop thereof: Hereupon by the command of King Hugo, there were two Synods called at Rhemes; in the first whereof Archbishop Arnulphus was accused, and in the 2d. convicted of Treason against the King by many witnesses, and thereupon deposed, excommunicated, and imprisoned. In this 2d. Synod Signinus Archbishop of Sens, president therein, related, That Arnulphus was accused of pillaging, and betraying the City of Rhemes to the Kings Enemies, which drew not only a scandal and suspition upon himself, but upon all the Clergy. Nunc, quia Religionis amore, & studio Serenissimi Regis nostri Domini Hugonis congregati sumus, quaerendum est, quomed, tanta infamia tacere possumus? & si frater & coepiscopus noster Arnulphus il∣lata crimina diluere queat, vel crimen laesae Majestatis propulsare: Scitis enim omnes nos insimulari probo infidelitatis & perfidiae, causa unius. Si, inquiunt, justis E∣piscopi utuatur legibas, si lissimique suis Regibus sunt, cur hominem impurissimum suis le∣gibus non puniunt? nimirum aliorum flagitia adeo moliuntur celare, ut impune liccat eis peccare. Absit hoc ab hoc sanctissimo coetu vestro, absit ut contra divinas ac humanas le∣ges quenquam moliamur defendere vel  re, &c. After which Siguinus said, Non patiar, discussionem fieri ejus, quid citur Majestatis obnxius, nisi forte convicto, (Episcopo) supplicii indulgentia promittatur: citing 31. capur Toletani Concilii, to this purpose: who be∣ing seconded by Daibertus, thereupon Herveus Episcopus replyed, Si hoc periculo∣sum est (for Bishops to judge and condemn a Bishop as guilty of High Treason) vi∣dete ne sit periculosius, judicia Ecclesiastica deinceps a Secularibus non expectari. Conse∣quens enim est, ad forensia Iura nos pertrahi, si divinis legibus videmur in ali∣quo obniti. At quomodo sine judicio relinquetur, quod commissum esse constiterit? vel cur contrae Principem nostrum causabimur, si quod attingere non audebinus, iudiciaria potestate conceditur? After some debates pro & contra, Arnulphus his Oath of Al∣giance to the King (which he had apparently violated) was produced, and publickly read in these words,Cap. 6. Cen: Magd. 10. col. 463, 464. Ego Arnulphus gratia Dei praeveniente Remorum Archi∣episcopus, promitto Regibus Francorum, Hugoni & Roberto, me fidem purissimam servaturum, consilium & duxilium, secundum meum scire & posse, in omnibus ne∣gotiis praebiturum: inimicos eorum nec consilio, nec auxilio ad eorum infidelitatem scienter adjuturum. Haec in confectu divinae Majestatis & Beatorum Spirituum, & totius Ecclesiaeassistentis assistens promitto; pro bene servatis laturus praemia aeternae benedictio∣nis. Si vero, quod nolo, & quod absit, ab his deviavero, omnis benedictio mea convertatur in maledictionem, & fiant dies mei pauci, et Episcopatum meum accipiat alter, Recedant a me amici mei, sintque perpetuo inimici. Huic vero chirographo a me edito in testimonium benedictionis vel maledictionis meae subscribo, fratresque & filios meos ut subscribant, rogo; Ego Arnulphus Archiepiscopus. After much debate, Arnulphus his Advocates were called into the Synod to make his defence, who prin∣cipally insisted on the Decrees of Pope Damasus, Pope Stephen, Sixtus, Iulius, Sym∣machus, Eusebius, Adrian, Fabian, and Anacletus, which were all read, to this effect; Quod Episcoporum judicia non aliter quam authoritate sedis Apostolicae sunt terminanda, and that no Clerk ought to accuse, or be heard against his own Bishop. To which was answered, That Hildemannus Beluacensis Episcopus, & Ebo Remorum Archiepis∣copus, were imprisoned in Monasteries by Ludovicus the Emperor, and deposed by a Synod without the Popes privity, consent, or leave first obtained: That King Huge and his Bishops of the Province of Rhemes had voluntarily complained to Pope Iohn of Arnulphus his treasons, demanding his advice, how to proceed against him in this new case, who delayed or refused to return his resolution therein; therfore they might justly proceed against him without the Popes advice; That Popes were now so infamous, scandalous, ignorant, &c. That they were unfit to be Judges in any case, and other inferiour Bishops of greater knowledge and holinesse, fitter to be their Judges, and all Bishops their equals. I shall recite King Hughs Letter to the Pope, desiring him only to inform
him being ignorant, how to proceed, and what Judgement to pronounce against Arnulphus his treasons therein recited. Beatissimo Papae Iohanni,Cap. 25. Cent. Magd. 10. col. 484. Hugo gratia Dei Francorum Rex. Novis atque inusita∣tis rebus permoti, summo studio, summaque cura vestra consilia expetenda decrevi∣mus, quippe cum sciamus, vos omne tempus in divinis ac humanis studiis exigisse. Considerate ergo quae facta sunt, & facienda praescribite, ut & sacis legibus su honor reddatur, & regalis potestas non annulletur. Arnulfus Regis Lo∣tharii (ut dicunt) filius, post graves inimicitias, ac scelera quae in regnum nostrum exercuit, loco parentis adoptatus est a nobis, ac Metropoli Remo∣rum gratis donatus: jusjurandum praebuit, quod contra praeterita & futura valeret Sacramenta, Libellum Chirographi conscripsit, recitavit, corroboravit, corrobora∣rique fecit. Milites ac omnes Cives jurare coegit, ut in nostra persisterent Fide, si ipse aliquando in potestatem hostium deveniret. Contra haec omnia, ut certissimi testes sunt, ipse portas hostibus patefecit, Clerum ac populum, suae fidei creditum, captivitati & praedae distribuit. Sed esto, eum esse addictum alienae potestati, ut ipse videri vult; ur Cives & Milites pejerare cogit? Cur arma contra nos comparat? Cur urbem ac Castra contra nos munit? Si Captus est, cur non patitur liberari? Si vi hostium op∣pressus, quare non vult sibi subveniri? Et si liberatus est, cur ad nos non redit? Vocatur ad Palatium, & venire contemnit. Invitatur ab Archiepiscopis, nihil se eis debere respondet. Ergo qui vices Apostolorum tenetis, statuite, quid de altero Iu∣da fieri debeat, ne nomen Dei per nos blasphemetur, & ne forte justo dolore per∣moti, ac vestra taciturnitate, urbis excidium, totiusque provinciae moliamur incen∣dium: nec judici Deo excusationem praetendetis, si nobis quaerentibus atque igno∣rantibus, formam Iudicii dare nolueritis. This Letter makes not the Pope the sole Judge of this Archbishop or his cause, but only craves his advice, how this King might proceed against him, in this new case: So did the French Bishops Letter to him sent along with it, to this effect. Domino & Reverendissimo Papae Iohanni,Cap. 26. Cent. Magd. 10 col. 485. Episcopi Remorum Diaeceseos. Non sumus nescii, Beatissime Pater, jamdudum opportuisse nos expetere consulta san∣ctae Romanae Ecclesiae, pro ruina atque occasu sacerdotalis ordinis, sed multitudine tyrannorum pressi, longitudine terrarum semoti, desideria nostra hactenus imple∣re nequivimus. Nunc itaque vestro examini, non sine magno dolore perferimus no∣vum atque inusitatum crimen Arnulfi Remorum Archiescopi, qui famosus Apostate factus, locum Iudae traditoris, olim in Ecclesia tenet, qui filius quondam Ecclesiae Laudunensis, cum Episcopum suum dolo & fraude ceperit, Ecclesiam ejus pervaserit, ad cumulum suae damnationis Remensem Ecclesiam sibi creditam, cum Clero & populo cap∣tivavit: nec movet eum nostra vocatio, vel potius saluberrima exhortatio, non Archie∣piscoporum comprovincialium multoties repetita admonitio, non canonice facta coram Deo & Angelis ejus professio, non Chirographi in conspectu Eccleseiae recitata de∣scriptio, non numerosa Sacramenta miris excogitata consiliis. Stant suo vitio, quam∣plures Ecclesiae pastoribus viduatae, pereunt innumerabiles populi sine Sacerdotali benedictione & confirmatione: ipse factione tyrannica, divina humanaque jura con∣temens, tyrannidem exercet. Regibus nostris, a quibus tantam Gloriam gratis consecutus est, interitum meditatur. Ergo tandem monstro perditissi∣mi hominis expergefacti ivimus in Sententiam Domini dicentis; Si peccaverit in te frater tuus, vade & corripe eum inter te, & ipsum solum. Si te audierit, lucratus es fra∣trem tuum; si autem te non audierit, adhibe tecum adhuc unum vel duos, ut in ore testi∣um duorum vel trium stet omne verbum; Quod si non audierit eos, dic Ecclesiae; Si au∣tem & Ecclesiae, non audierit, sit tibi sicut Ethnicus & Publicanus. Adesto Pater ru∣enti Ecclesiae, & sententiam ex sacris canonibus promulgatam, vel potius ab ipsa veritate prolatam, profer in reum. (To wit, only by way of advice communicated to the King and them, not of actual execution.) Sentiamus in vobis alterum Petrum, defen∣sorem, & corroboratorem Christiane fidei; ferat Sancta Romana Ecclesia sententiam damnationis in reum, quem universalis damnat Ecclesia. Suffragetur nobis (by way of direction and approbation of their proceedings in a former Synod) vestra Authoritas, & in hujus Apostatae dejectione, & in ejus qui domni Dei praeesse possit, Archiepiscopi nova ordinatione: Simulque invocatis Episcopis nostris fratribus, necessaria promotione, ut sciamus & intelligamus, cur inter caeteros Apostolatum vestrum praeferre debeamus. The Pope receiving these Letters from the King and his Bishops against Arnul∣fus, Legatos primo blande accepit; postea verò quam Hereberti Comitis Legati (on be∣half
of Arnulfus) equum corpore praestantem, niveo colore insignem, cum aliis muneri∣bus Pontifici obtulerunt; se per triduum ante januam palatii defatigatos, nec admissos: Thereupon, infecto negotio redierunt. Upon which account the Synod of Rhemes re∣solved, That they might justly proceed against this Trayterous Archbishop without the Popes advice. In pursuit whereof:Cap. 28 Cent. Magd. 10. col 486, 487. Multa super his Pater Arnulfus (President in this Synod) publice loquutus est, multa cum sibi tantum assidentibus contulit, to this effect: Nos vero, inquit, Reverendissimi Patres, Romanam Ecclesiam propter beati Petri memoriam semper honorandam decernimus, nec decretis Romanorum Pontifi∣cum obviare contendimus; salva tamen Authoritate Niceni Concilii, quod eadem Romana Ecclesia semper venerata est. Statuta etiam Sacrorum Canonum diversis locis, diversis temporibus (sed eodem Dei spiritu conditorum) in aeternum valere praecipimus, ab omnibus servanda censemus. Duo autem sunt, quae magnopere a nobis praevideri debent: id est, Romani Pontificis silentium, aut nova Constitutio, promul∣gatis legibus Canonum vel decretis priorum praejudicare potest. Si enim silentium praejudicat, omnes leges, omnia priorum decreta,eo. & silente silere necesse est. Si au∣tem nova Constitutio, quid prosunt leges conditae, cum ad unius arbitri∣um omnia dirigantur? Videtis, quia his duabus causis admissis, Ec∣clesiarum Dei status periclitatur: et dum legibus leges quaerimus, nullas omnino leges habemus. Quid ergo? Num privilegio Romani Pontificis de∣rogabimus? minime: Sed si Romanus Episcopus is est quem scientiae & vitae meritum commendat, nec silentium, nec nova Constitutio metuenda sunt. Quod si vel igno∣rantia, vel metu, vel cupiditate abalienetur, vel conditio invidiam facit, (quod fere sub haec tempora vidimus) Romae tyrannide praevalente: tunc multo minus idem silentium, & nova Constitutio formidanda sunt. Non enim is qui quolibet modo contra leges est, legibus praejudicare potest. Sed O lugenda Roma, quae no∣stris majoribus clara Patrum lumina praebuisti, nostris temporibus monstrosas tenebras futuro saeculo famosas effudisti. Olim accepimus claros Leones, mag∣nos Gregorios. Quid dicam de Gelasio & Innocentio, qui omnem mundanam Philo∣sophiam sua sapientia & eloquentia superant? Longa series eorum est, qui sua Doctrina mundum repleverunt. Eorum itaque dispositioni, qui vitae merito & sci∣entia cunctos mortales anteirent, recte universalis Ecclesia credita est; quamvis et in hac ipsa foelicitate hoc privilegium tibi ab Affricanis Episcopis contradictum sit, has credo quas patimur miserias magis, quam typum domina∣tionis formidantibus. Nam quid sub haec tempora non vidimus? Vidimus Jo∣hannem cognomento Octavianum, in volutabro libidinum versatum, etiam contra eum Othonem, quem Augustum creaverat, conjurasse: quo fugato, Leo Neophytus in Pontificem creatur. Sed Otthone Caesare Roma discedente, Octavianus Romam re∣dit, Leonem fugat: Johannem Diaconum naso, dextris digitis, ac lingua mutilat: multaque caede primorum in Urbe debacchatus, in brevi moritur: cui Benedictum Diaconum, cognomento Grammaticum, Romani substituunt: eum quoque Leo Neo∣phytus cum suo Caesare non longe post aggreditur, obsidet, capit, deponit, perpe∣tuoque exilio in Germaniam dirigit. Succedit Otthoni Caesari Caesar Ottho, natura, aetate, cunctos Principes armis, consilio ac scientia superans. Succedit Romae in Pon∣tificatus horrendum monstrum, Malefacius, cunctos mortales nequicia superans, etiam prioris Pontificis sanguine cruentus: sed hic etiam fugatus est, in magna Synodo damnatus: post obitum divi Otthonis Romam redit, insignem virum Apostolicum, Petrum Papiensis Ecclesiae prius Antistitem, data Sacramentorum fide, ab arce Urbis dejicit, deponit: squalore carceris affectum peri∣mit. Num talibus monstris hominum, ignominia plenis, scientia di∣vinarum et humanarum rerum vacuis, innumeris Sacerdotes Dei per orbem terrarum scientia et vitae merito conspicuos, subjici decre∣tum est? Quid est hoc Reverendissimi Patres? vel quonam vitio fieri credendum est, ut caput Ecclesiarum Dei, quod in sublime erectum, gloria & honore coronatum est, ita in infima dejectum, ignominia et dedecore deturpatum sit? Nostrum, nostrum est hoc peccatum, nostra impietas, qui quaerimus quae nostra sunt, non quae Jesu Christi. Si enim in quovis ad Episcopatum electo, morum gravitas, vitae meri∣tum, divinarum ac humanarum rerum scientia, subtiliter investigantur; quid in eo qui omnium Episcoporum Magister videri appetit, investigandum
non est? cur ergo in summa sede sic infimus constituitur, ut etiam in Clero nullum habere locum dignus inveniatur? Quid hunc Reve∣rendi Patres in sub solio residentem, veste purpurea & aurea radiantem, quid hunc (inquam) esse censetis?Nota. Nimirum si charitate destituitur, solaque scientia in∣flatur, & extollitur, Antichristus est, in Templo Dei sedens, et se osten∣dens tanquam sit Deus. Si autem nec charitate fundatur, nec scientia erigitur, in Templo Dei tanquam statua, tanquam idolum est; a quo responsa petere, marmora consulere est. Quo ergo con∣sultum ibimus? Evangelium docet, quendam in ficulnea ter fructum quaesisse, & quia non repererit, succidere voluisse, sed admonitum expectasse. Expectemus ergo primates nostros, quoad possumus: atque interim divini verbi pabula, ubinam reperiri vale∣ant, investigemus. Certe in Belgica & Germania, quae vicinae nobis sunt, summus Sacerdotes Dei, in religione admodum praestantes, inventri, in hoc sacro conven∣testes quidam sunt. Proinde, si Regum dissidentium animositas non prohibere, inde magis Episcoporum judicium petendum fore videtur, quam ab ea Vrbe, quae nunc temporis venalis exposita, ad nummorum quan∣titatem judicia trutinat. Quod si quispiam dixerit, secundum Gelaium, Romanum Ecclesiam de tota Ecclesia judicare, ipsam ad nullius comeare judicium, nec de ejus unquam judicio judicari posse: quanquam hoc ipsum Affricani Episcopi im∣possibile judicant, nisi forte (inquiunt) quisquam est qui credat, unicilibet posse Dominum nostrum examinis inspirare justiciam, et innumerabilibus congregatis in Concilium Sacerdotibus deuega∣re. Sed cum hoc tempore Romae nullus pene sit (ut fama est) qui Literas didicerit, sine quibus (ut scriptum est) vix ossiarius efficitur, qua fronte aliquis eorum docere audebit, quod minime didicit? Ad comparationem quippe Romani Pontificis, in aliis Sacerdotibus ignorantia utcun∣que tolerabilis est; in Romano autem, cui de fide, vita, moribus, discipli∣na Sacerdotum, deque universali Ecclesia Catholica iudicandum est, intolerabilis videri potest. Is enim est (ut quibusdam placet) qui secundum Ezechielem Prophetam, moratur in Gazophylacio, quod respicit viam meridianam, & excubat in custodiis Templi; Cur autem loco prior, scientia inferior, non aequo animo ferat judicium loco inferioris, scientia prioris? Certe ipse Apostolorum Princeps non abnuit judicium, quamvis loco mi∣noris, Pauli scientia prioris, in faciem sibi resistentis, quoniam non sana videbatur Doctrina Magistri; & Gregorius Papa cum dicat, Si quae culpa in Episcopis inveni∣tur, nescio quis Apostolicae sedi subjectus non sit; subinfert, Cum vero culpa non exegit, omnes secundum rationem humilitatis pares sunt. Involutus ergo crimi∣nibus, sentiat praeesse sibi Romanum Pontificem: qui nullis atrocioribus factis prae∣gravatur, intelligat, parem dignamque se ac Romano Pontifice in quolibet negotio laturus sententiam. Sed esto, ponamus nunc Romae esse Damasum, quid contra ejus decretum actum est? Nempe, fi bene recordor, primum Capitulum suit quod Episcoporum & summorum negotiorum Ecclesiasticorum causae semper ad se∣dem Apostolicam sint referendae. Utique relatae sunt, non solum ab Episcopis, sed etiam a Principe nostro serenissimo, liberaque potestas Apostolicae sedi data est, & vera investigandi, & cognoscendi & di judicandi, per temporum intervalla nimis pro∣lixa: nec prius ad causam accessimus, quam desperatione judicii ejus (by way of advice, rather then final censure) protraheremur. Consultus est ergo Romanus Episcopus ut o∣portuit, & de hujus Arnulsi depositione, & de ejus qui domui Dei digne praeesse posset substitutione; sed our nihil responderit, quorum interest ipsi viderint. Nos autem Sar∣dicense Concilium, quod privilegio Romanae Ecclesiae plurimum favet, ita ad hanc cau∣sam inflectimus, ut quod de solo Episcopo in qualibet provincia relicto dicit, ad Roma∣num Episcopum affectum esse credamus, &c.

Arnulfus being thereupon deposed and committed to pri∣son in the City of Aurelia, Gerbertus (afterwards Pope) was made Archbishop in his place; and Siguinus Senonensis Archiepiscopus (who would not consent to Arnulfus his deposition, quae magis ipsius aulae insatiabili odio, quam Episcoporum sententia fiebat, as he conceived) una cum Arnulfo in carcerem ire jubetur: qua quidem re Hugo Rex suae tranquillitati consulere studebat: ac Triennium utrique in captivitate conservantur.

Hisce plus quam panicis terroribus praemissis; he cau∣sed another Synod of the French Bishops to meet at Rhemes, whereof Siguinus, è car∣cere eductus, was made President; wherein the deposition of Archbishop Arnulfus was examined, and in conclusion, by the connivance of King Hugo, Arnulfus (against the Canons, and his own confession) was restored, Gerbertus (who made a most elegant Oration therein, demonstrating the simony and intrusion of Arnulfus, the justice of his deposition, and legality of his own advancement to it) deposed, or rather translated from thence to the Bishoprick of Ravenna, to give satisfaction to the King and him, ex qua veluti scala postea in Romanum Episcopatum emergit. This Archbishop Gerbertus in hisBibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 10. p. 615, 619, 634. 1. Epistle,Anno 998. Othoni Caesari, hath these expressi∣ons: Loquatur Dominus mens servo suo propriis Epistolis solio more, ut ejus servitutis fiat exhibitio, &c. Quantum enim in nobis est, quod possibile este esse, consequens est nos perficere, si vestrum cognoverimus velle. Non dicatur Majestatis reus, cui pro Caesare stare semper fuit gloria, contra Caesarem ignominia. Epistola 154.

Paremus ergo Caesar, Imperi∣alibus edictis, tum in hoc, tum in omnibus quaecunque divina Maje∣stas vestra decreverit. Non enim deesse possumus obsequio, qui nihil inter humanas res dulcius aspicimus vestro Imperio. Epist. 34. he hath the like passages. Epist. 12. he thus complains: Ipse Caesar omnium hominum excellentissimus, a fur∣ciferis asino coaequatur. O amicorum fidelissime; recordare quod te oraverim, me malle esse nulitem in Caesarianis castris, quam Regem in extraneis. And in hisPhilip. Mor∣ney, Historia Papatus, p. 22, 223. Epistola ad Wilderodonem Episcopum Argentinensem, he thus asserts the Rights of the Kings and Church of France, against the Popes Usurpations. Tu dicis Arunlphum incendia, seditiones, traditiones, flagitia, captivitates, suorumque di∣reptiones exercentem, suorum Regum interritus molientem, Patriam hostibus prodentem, divina humanaque contemnentem, nec communione debuisse privari, nec potestate Principis abjici,Rom. 13. sine Episcopi Romani jussione; cum Apostolus dicat: Quia Princeps non sine causa gladium portat, sed ad vindictam malefactorum, laudem vero bonorum. Favete omnes, qui Regibus vestris fidem promisistis, promissamque servare vultis, qui Clerum vobis commissum & populum nec tradi∣distis, nec tradere disponitis; vos inquam, qui tantorum scelerum facta perhorrescitis, favete his qui obediunt Deo jubenti.Mat. 18. Peccantem & Ecclesiae non obaudientem haben∣dum sicut Ethnicum & Publicanum: qui iterum dicit vobis; Vae vobis Scribae & Pha∣risaei qui transgredimini mandatum Dei, &c. Et ne quis nos in invidiam adducat, quasi privilegiis Romanae Ecclesiae derogantes, audiat Hieronymum dicentem. Si authori∣tas quaeritur, orbis major est Urbe: Quod si persona major Presbytero quaeritur, ille Sacerdos magnus Leo Papa accedat; Non tenetur, inquit, Petri privilegium, ubi non ex ejus aequitate fertur judicium, &c. At quid judicata, si judicanda exinde non informan∣tur? aut quomodo mansuras in aeternum leges trecenti decem & octo Patres constituerunt, si horum constituta ad unius libitum permutantur, aut perimuutur? Apiarius Presbyter ab Afris damnatus, a Romanis communioni restitutus est. Scribunt Af∣ricani Papae Coelestino, contra Nycaenam Synodum factum videri. Aiunt Calumniato∣res nostri, Summum Sacerdotem Arnulphum a Summo Sacerdote Romano debuisse tan∣tum dijudicari; ait Beatus Augustinus, si Caecilianum totius Africae primatem ejus ac∣cusatores, quod in vita non potuerunt, post mortem convincant, a sacrorum proditori∣bus
voluminum ordinatum, vel ipsum proditorem fuisse, & post mortem sine r∣tractatione se ei Anathema dicturum. Licuit ergo Episcopis Galliarum viventi Ar∣nulpho confesso & convicto, ut Ethnico & Publicano dixisse Anathema; licuit inquam, sequi Evangelistas, Apostolos, Prophetas, sacra Concilia, vivorum Apostolorum decreta, ab his quatuor non discordantia, semper in usu habita, semper habenda, &c. Pressa jacet Tyrannide omnis Ecclesia Gallorum, atqui non a Gallis, sed ab his a quibus spere∣batur salus. Sed una salus hominis ô Christe tu es; Ipsa Roma omnium Ecclesiarum hactenus habita mater, malis benedicere, bonis maledicere fertur, et qui∣bus nec ave dicendum est, communicare, tuamque legem zelantes damnare, abutens ligandi et solvendi potestate a te accepta.

Hereupon, Clerus & populus sibi ab Imperatore metuentes, Brunonem in Pontificem eligunt, (called Gregory the 5.) à quo Otto cum benedictionem, tum Coronam Imperii accepit: Ottone ad Germaniam regresso, Romanus populus, novarum rerum cupidus, Crescentium ad consularem potestatem trabunt, & res Romanas ejus fidei atque industriae committunt. Crescentius & populus aegre ferentes Gregorium, Germanum natione, Auctoritate Imperatoris creatum Pontificem, ideo illum sede Pontificia ejiciunt, & Johannem 18. natione Graecum, Placentinum Episcopum (hominem perniciosum, insatiabili mentis ardore Papatum muneribus, tumultu ac seditione, aliorum Pontificum more, ambientem) Pontificem creant; qui per factionem pecuniis corruptam sedem occupavit, quod illi exitium, divina ultione, horridum postea pe∣perit. Gregorius, ad Imperatorem se conferens, de injuria queritur. Imperator indig∣ne ferens hanc contumeliam, cum exercitu in Italiam redit; Urbem obsedit, oppugna∣vit impigre: Hereupon the Romans deserting Crescentius and Pope John, veniam ab Imperatore sibi dari petunt, aperiuntque Germanis portas: The Pope and Crescentius thereupon fled to the strong Castle of St. Angelo, where after some assaults, descen∣dunt ad Imperatorem veniam petituri; in itinere intercipiuntur.

Pernices mercantur equos; venalia Romae, Templa, Sacerdotes, Altaria Sacra, Coronae, Ignes, Thura, Preces, Coelum est venale, Deusque. Miror ego (inquit Platina) Historicos Johannem istum inter Pontifices numerasse, cum vivente adhuc Gregorio, sedem occupasset, nisi forte in conscribendis Pontificum vitis, ita faciendum censeant, ut in perpetua Historia fit. Nam & Tyrannorum perver∣sa facta, optimorum Pricipum rebus gestis annumerantur; ut quantum inter se boni & mali dissident à legentibus agnosci possit; quo malorum exemplo a vitiis deterreantur, & bono∣rum exemplo al virtutes impulsi, vitam in terris beatam ducant.

After which, Congregata Romae Synodo, the Emperor and Pope perceiving the vari∣ous contentions and events concerning the Emperors election, arising from the am∣bition of Princes, & Episcoporum philargyria, they ordained in this Synod, ut jus eli∣gendi Caesares apud Germaniae Principes deinde maneret; scilicet, Maguntinensem, Treverensem, & Coloniensem Archiepiscopos, Comitem Palatinum Rheni, Ducem Saxoniae, ac Marchionem Brandeburgensem, & Bohemiae Principem ad dirimendas
discordias in paribus suffragiis. Quam sanctionem Anno Dom. 1002. Otto Imperator approbavit, without which it had been a meer nullity.

This Pope, artibus Diabolicis intentus, totus se Satanae mancipabat, & jurejurando se tradidit from his youth, obtain∣ing all his former preferments, and the Papacy, magicis artibus, & strenua opera Dia∣boli adjutus. Which he concealing after he was made Pope (lest he should seem the Devils Vicar, rather then Christs) Aeneum vero caput domi in abdito quodam loco ser∣vabat, per quod Diabolus de rebus futuris an ipso rogatus, responsa dabat. Sylvester in tan∣to honorum gradu Diaboli ope constitutus, consuluit aliquando Diabolum de tantae foelicitatis suae dinturnitate: qui ressondit, Non eum moriturum, nisi Hierosolymas missam celebraret. Pontifex urbem Palestinae intelligens, longissime mortem a se abesse somniabat, cumnihil minus quam de Hierosolyma adcunda cogitaret: Impiam igitur & ab omni mendations cura, liberam agebat vitam. But soon after saying Masse in Lent, according to the custom of former Popes, in the Church of St. Crosse, called rusalem, in ipsis sacris ardenti febre corripitur, daemonum{que} audit strepitum; where∣upon conceiving himself deluded by the Devils ambiguous answer, and that his death approached, Conscientiae morsu saevissimo excitatus, scelus suum deploravit, & praesentibus Cardinalibus rem omnem multo cum gemitu aperuit. Membra omnia quibus Diabolo obsequium praestiterat (viz. manus & linguam, sunt, qui addunt, genitalia) prae∣cidi jussit: Deinde truncum mortuum super bigam jussit poni, at ubicun{que} animalia per∣ducerent & subsisterent sepeliretur; And then expiring (Anno Dom. 1001. as some, or 1003. as others compute) the Cardinals executed what he desired on his corps. Et quis non hinc intelligat (writes Balaeus) qualenam istud munus sit, qualis sit dignitas, quale officium, quod Diabolus sine censura novit, quodque Satanicis atque nefariis artibus ade∣pisci possunt homines perditissimi? Quale sit etiam Missae sacrificum, quod vivis & mortuis prodesse crebro jactitant, cum Diabolus tantam tragoeiam adversus sanctissi∣mum Petri successorem & socium (Simonem Magum, potius) sub eo excitaverit, at∣que ad lacum tartareum secum tandem traxerit. Before I proceed further, I cannot but take notice of a memorable passage of Car∣dinal Annalium Eccl. Tom. 1. Anno 912. Artic. 8. Phil: Morney Hist Papatus, p. 123. Baronius (a chief Assertor of the universal Supremacy, and uninter∣rupted Succession of the Popes and Church of Rome) touching the corrupt, detestable state of the Church and Bishops of Rome, in this age. Quae tunc facies Ecclesiae Roma∣nae? quam foedissima, cum Romae dominarentur potentissimae aeque ac sordidissimae Meretrices? Quarum arbitrio mutarentur sedes, darentur Episcopi, & quod auditu horrendum & infandum est, intruderentur in sedem Petri eorum amasii, et Pseudo-Pontifices, qui non sunt nisi ad consignanda tanta tempora in Catalogo Romanorum Pontificum scripti. Quis enim a Scortis hujusmodi intrusos, sine lege, legitimos dicere posset, Romanos fuisse Pontifices? Nusquam Cleri eli∣gentis, vel consentientis postea, aliqua mentio, Canones pressi silentio, decreta Pon∣tificum suffocata, proscriptae antiquae traditiones veteresque in eligendo Summo Pon∣tifice consuetudines, sacrque ritus & pristinus usus, prorsus extincti. Sic vendica∣verat omnia sibi libido seculari potentia freta, insaniens, aestro percita dominandi. Dormiebat tunc plane alto (ut apparet) sopore Christus in Navi, cum ipse flantibus validis ventis, navis ipsa fluctibus operiretur. Dormiebat, inquam, qui ista non vi∣dere dissimulans, sineret sic fieri, dum non exurgeret vindex. Et quod deterius vi∣detur, deerant qui Dominum sic dormientem clamoribus excitarent discipuli, ster∣tentibus omnibus. Qualesnam reris delectos ab hisce monstris Presbyteros & Diaco∣nos Cardinales fuisse putandum, cum nihil tam naturae insitum sit, quam unumquem∣que sibi similem generare? Quos in omnibus his, a quibus delecti fuerint, consen∣sisse dubitare quis poterit? imitatosque esse ipsos, sectatosque eorum vestigia quis non facile credat, & optasse hos omnes Dominum dormisse semper, & nunquam in judicium surrecturum, evigilaturum, nunquam ad ipsorum cognoscenda & punien∣da facinora quis non intelligat? On which passage, Philip Lord Morney hath this ob∣servation. Et ex hoc solo loco judicet Lector, quam tantopere ostentavit Episcoporum Romanorum successionem, (he might adde, his Supremacy, Headship over the Church, as Christs Vicar General) quo jure defendere possit? To which I shall subjoyn this observation of learnedRodolphus Gualtherus Hom. l. 3. de Antichristo, Balaeus in Viti Pontif. l. 4. p. 174. Gualther, relating to the successive Popes
in the same age. Jam ergo penes cordatum quemvis judicium esto, non merito de Pontificum tyrannide & iniquitate conquesti sint optimi quique, cum tot (quos modo commemoravimus) nebulones, tyrannos, fures, raptores, latrones, se∣ditiosos, adulteros, et palam sacrilegos (he might have added homicidas, apo∣statas, Necromanticos, haereticos, idololatricos, atheisticos) intra tam paucos annos, sedes illa gestaverit. Et quis sodes ceu sanctam veneretur, quae tor pestes sustinere po∣tuit? Nondum tamen impletus satis fuit impiissimorum hominum catalogus, &c. To these I could subjoyn the concurrent Testimonies of Platina, Sabellicus, Wernerus, St. Bernard, Genebrardus, Bellarmin, and others, collected by our incomparable Ia∣cobus Usserius, in his Book, De Christianarum Ecclesiarum Successione & statu, c. 2, 3, 4. to which I refer the Reader: concluding with this memorable passage ofEnead. 9. l. 1. & 2. Ant. Coccius Sabellicus, evidencing the Emperors Supremacy over Popes: Non possum non multum mirar, unde Tragica haec Pontificum fluxerint exempla, quam dira pre∣tatis oblivio eorum mentes irrepserit, ut neque personae quem sustinebant ratio ab his ulla haberetur, neque loci quem tenerent, ut non immerito aliquis suspi∣caretur, quicquid moderaminis fuit et Majestatis in illis, quia Ca∣roli cognomento Magni temporibus ad Gallici Imperii exitum in∣terfuit (interfuit enim aetas una) sedem tenuerunt, non tam sua sponte, quam Regum, Imperatorum, et in quorum tutela essent metu et reverentia, in officio manserunt. Wherefore it was very necessary, at least expedient for the good government, reformation of Popes, Prelates, and the Church of God, that Christian Kings and Emperors should have a Superintendent coercive power over them, to keep them all in good order, to restrain, correct their detesta∣ble Enormities and exorbitances; especially since Wernerus (a Carthuan Monk) wri∣ting of this degenerate age, and Popes therein, pronounceth, Sanctitatem Pa∣pam dimisisse, ac ad Imperatores accessisse hoc tempore, sicut Cla∣re apparet; andChronograph. l. 4. in princi∣pio, 10. seculi. Genebrardus records, Hoc seculum uno infelix, quod per annos fre 150. Pontifices circiter 50. a virtute majorum prorsus defecerint, Apotactici, Apostaticive potius, quam Apostolici: And could such Mon∣sters of men, and Apostates from the life and faith of Christ, be his Universal Vicars over his Church on earth, and not rather those pious Christian Kings, Emperors, who punished their excesses?

This Pope by the perswasion of his Clergy Romanum populum Pontificis electione privavit, adjectis his clausulis, Docen∣dus (Ducendus) est populus, non sequendus: Major est dignitas legis quae regitur Spiritu sancto (whereby these Popes were not ruled, but by the unclean Spirit the Devil) quam legis secularis. Leges Imperatorias nihil esse dicebat: But by a divine retalation, his Papal authority was so much slighted, that Veneno a suis domesticis sublatus est, within 5. moneths after his consecration, to make way for his successor Iohn the 20. qui prodig iosis artibus Satanici Papatus sellam occupavit. A praedicto enim Sylvestro, qui Magus diabolicus erat, usque ad Gregorium septimum, sceleratissimum nebulonem, ac praestigiatorem iniquissimum, famosi fuerunt incantatores Romani Pontifices omnes, Jannem & Jambrem Aegyptos Magos longe superantes, as Benno Cardinalis, Balaeus, and others inform us.

Fulbertus on this occasion writ an Epistle to Pope John, ut eum de sanguine filiorum tuorum ita arguere & castigare me∣mineris,

The Emperor Henry the 2d. who ob eximium religionis studium Pii nomen sorti∣tus est;Anno 1007. by his Imperial power about the year 1007. summoned two Synods, not only of his Bishops and Clergy, but likewise of his Nobles; wherein himself was present, sharply reprehending the Bishops in publick Orations to them, for neglect∣ing their duties, and not rooting out, and cutting off putrid Members with the sword of the Spirit, lest they should corrupt the sound.

He was often deiected from his Papal See by the Romans for his vices, cruelty, ignorance; Literarum enim adeo rudis erat, ut collegam qui suo loco sacra tractaret, secum consecrare voluerit: verum pluribus id fieri improbantibus, ab in∣cepto destitit.

Pope Gregory the 6. having bought the Papacy of Benedict the 9th. to recruit his Treasury,Anno 1046, 1047, after solemn admonition, excommunicated, and that not prevailing, made War upon, and sent unto all those who robbed pilgrims or strangers, and took away their oblations by force, slaying and robbing them even in the very Churches of Rome, as our Malmesbury and others relate, by which means he not only restored, but exceedingly augmented the goods of the Church; whereupon the Cardinals stiled him a Symoniack, a Man-slayer, a thirster after blood, and un∣worthy Christian burial. YeaHistoriae l. 5. c. 5, 6. Radulphus Glaber, a Monk of Clungy, living in that age, records, that Henry the 2. calling the Archbishops and Bishops of his Do∣minions together, complained thus of the universal corruption in the Clergy. Omnes gradus Ecclesiastici à maximo Pontifice usque ad Ostiarium opprimuntur per suae dam∣nationis pretium, ac juxta vocem Dominicam, in cunctis grassatur spirituale latrocinium: Glaber subjoyns, Et haec non solum in Gallicanis Episcopis, pullulaverat nequitia pessima,
sed totam occupaverat Italiam: omnia quippe Ministeria Ecclesiasti∣ca eo tempore ita habebantur venalia, quasi in foro secularia merci∣monia. Ipso tempore Romana sedes quae universalis jure habetur in orbe terrarum, praefato morbo pestifero, per viginti quinque annorum spatia miserrime lboraverat; fuerat enim eidem sedi ordinatus quidam puer circiter annorum duodecim, contra jus fasque, quem scilicet sola pecunia auri et argenti plus commendavit, quam aetas & sancti∣tas. Et quoniam infelicem habuit introitum, infeliciorem persersit exitum: suitable, turpitudini illius conversationis & vitae.Glabot. l. 4. c. 7. Tunc, tum in saeculari potestate, tum etiam in Ecclesiastica Religione totius regiminis personae constiterant, in puerili aetate, propter peccata enim populi contigit tunc illud Salomonicum, quod ait, Vae tibi terrae. Nam & ipse universalis Papa Romanus, nepos scilicet duorum, Benedicti atque Johannis, qui ei praecesserant, puer ferme decennis intercedente Thesaurorum pecunia electus exti∣tit a Romanis, a quibus exinde frequenter ejectus, ac inhoneste recep∣tus, nulla potestate viguit. Et ut jam superius taxavimus, caeteros tunc temporis Ecclesiarum Praelatos, aurum potius vel argentum exaltabat, quam meritum. Prohpudor, de his evidentissime Scriptura ait, imo os ipsius Dei, Principes extiterunt & non cognovi, &c. YeaBelli Sacri, l. 1. c. 8. William Archbishop of Tyrus made this just com∣plaint of the general Apostacy and corruptions in all professors of Christianity in that age, occasioned by the evil examples, vitious and Athestical lives of Popes, Bi∣shops, and Clergymen, which drew down Gods judgements on them in most places: In occidente & in omni pene orbe terrarum, minime inter eos qui fideles dicebantur, fides de∣fecerat, & Domini timor erat de medio sublatus: perierat de rebus justitia, & aequitate subacta violentia dominabatur in populis. Fraus, dolus & circumventio late involaverant universa. Virtus omnis locum dederat, & cesserat quasi inutilis, malitia subintrante. Videbatur sane mundus declinasse ad vesperam, & filii hominis adventus secundus fore vici∣nior. Nam multorum refrixerat charitas, & fides non inveniebatur super terram. Confu∣sis ordinibus cuncta ferebantur, & in Chaos pristinum mundus videbatur redire velle. For∣nicationum genus quodlibet, quasi res licita, passim & sine rubore exercebatur impune. Sed nec inter affines aut propinquos tuta erant Matrimoniorum federa. Amica coelestibus & Deo placens, quasi res vilis, jussa migrare erat continentia. Nec parsimoniae aut sobrie∣tati locus erat, ubi luxus & ebrietas, & pernox alea praeoccupaverant additus, atque atria possidebant. Nec Clerus a populo vita nobiliore differebat, sed sicut inHos. 4. 9. Propheta legi∣tur, Sicut populus, ita & Sacerdos. (YeaSermo 1.  Conversione Pauli. St. Bernard addes, Non est jam dicere, ut populus sic Sacerdos, quia nec sic populus ut Sacerdos, the Popes, Prelates, Priests being then far more unchast, impious, atheistical, exorbitant in all kinds then the common people.) Nam Episcopi, aegligentes facti erant: Canes muti, non valentes latrare, &c. Quid plura? ut in summa dicatur, omne in praecipiti vitium stetit, & omnis caro cor∣ruperat viam suam. Nec pronos ad malum revocare poterant Domini comminantis in coelo sursum ostenta, nec signa in terra deorsum.Mat. 24. 7. Erant enim pestilentiae & fames terroresque de coelo, & terrae motus magni per loca: & caetera quae Dominus in Evangelio diligenter enumerat. Sed obstinati in operibus mortuis, quasi sus in volutabro, & quasi ju∣menta putrescebant in stercore suo, pia Domini longanimitate abutentes: quasi quibus à Domino diceretur.Jerem. 5. 3. Percussi eos, & non doluerunt; curavi eos, & non sunt sauci∣ati. The source, fountain of all this impiety, pravity, Apostacy, sprang from Rome, which instead of one sacred head, had a Three-headed Cerberus ruling over it, thus re∣lated byChron. lib. 6. c. 32.

Hunc miserimum statum Ecclesiae religiosus quidam Pres∣byter, Gratianus nomine, videns, reliquiis pietatis matri suae compatiendo animadvertens, praefatos viros adiit, eisque a sancta sede recedere, pecunia persuasit: Benedicto reddi∣tibus Angliae, quia majoris videbatur auctoritatis esse, relictis.

Igitur ad ejus Imperium (not the Popes) illic Episcoporum, Abbatum, Religiosorum{que} virorum grandi multitudine, Romanum quoque Pontificem, qui praeesset Concilio, invitat. Quid multa? Concilio habito, Synodicis Canonibus atque sententiis Gregorius Symoniacus probatus, sponte sua sede desiliens, Pontificalibus se infulis exuit, & humi prostratus (at the Emperors feet) temeratae dignitatis veniam sibi humiliter petiit.

After the death of Damasus, the Romans being much vexed by Pope Benedict the 9th. formerly deposed and banished by the Emperor, who returning to Rome, ad pristinam dignitatem perfas nefasque aspirabat; thereupon, Romani (pertaesi se∣ditionum quas excitaverant Papatus invasores) consilio Cardinalium, legatos ad ipsum Imperatorem dirigunt, et ut aliquem in Papam eligendum Romam mittat exposcunt, as some; or, ut Pontificem ipsis daret, as others expresse it: Alterna invidia magis, quam honore Regio moti, as Crantzius observes. The Emperor thereupon Brunonem Tullensem Episcopum (invitum & coactum) Romam mittit, simplicem ingenio virum; cum inter Episco∣pos Germaniae non esset qui veneficiis Romanis praefici vellet: Who travelling to∣ward Rome in his Pontifical habit; Abbatem Cluniacensem, & Hildebrandum Mona∣chum (Sacerdotium & Regnum sub specie religionis eversurum, ac juramentum Im∣peratori praestitum non diu servaturum, multarumque calamitatum authorem) in itinere obvios habuit. Qui videntes eum Pontificiis ornatum insigniis, apostaseos crimen illi odiose impingebant. Persuadebant ergo illi, ut deposito habitu Pon∣tificio,
Romam consueto cultu peteret; dicentes, Imperatori non esse concessum ius eligendi Papam (egregie mentita est sibi iniquitas, adds Balaeus) sed Clero & Romano populo, tam bene memores juramenti sui boni patres erant. Bruno ad∣monentibus morem gessit, deposito Pontificio apparatu privatus urbem ingreditur, seipsum accusans (Hildebrando persuasore) quod Imperatori maluerit quam Deo ob∣temperari. Hereupon, Romanus Clerus eundem Brunonem, (some stile him Barronem) in Pontificem eligunt, & eo libentius, quod omnem authoritatem eligendorum Pontificum ab Imperatore (ut par erat, writes Platina) ad Clerum transtu∣lisset, non ad Caesarem, & propterea Leonem 9. illum appellabant, cum merus esset Asinus, as Balaeus brands him. Hildebrandum ipsum statim sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Diaconum Cardinalem creat, ac Pontificii muneris consortem, committens ei curam Ecclesiae Sancti Petri. ThisSurius Concil. Tom. 3. p. 577, to 597. Pope Leo the 9. writ a large Epistle, Michaeli Constantinopolitano & Le∣oni Acridano Episcopis, adversus eorum inauditas praesumptiones; for denying the Supremacy of the Bishop of Rome, and stiling Michael, Universal Bishop and Patriarch, in derogation of his Papal Supremacy; which this Pope endeavours to vindicate by misapplied Scriptures, and the Emperor Constantines forged Donation, (therein reci∣ted at large, and in Gratian Distinct. 96.) giving Pope Sylvester therein, a superiori∣ty over all the other 4. Sees of Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Constantinople, ac etiam super omnes universo orbe terrarum Dei Ecclesias; granting him his Royal Palace of Rome; quod omnibus in toto orbe terrarum praefertur atque praeellit Palatiis.

Which forged Donation (at large refuted byIn his Defence of Constantine, and Treatise of the Popes Tem∣poral Monar∣chy, (the learn∣edest of this kin & subject) London 162. Dr. Crakenthorp and sundry others) if admitted true, infallibly evidenceth all the Popes Temporal and Ecclesiastical pretended Su∣premacy, Dominion, State, to be derived from this Emperor, not from Christ, or St. Peter, and that it was originally vested in the Emperor and his Successors by Christ himself, else his grant thereof to Pope Sylvester and his successors, was but a meer nullity: since, Nemo potest dare, quod non habet. Besides, this Pope writ anSurius Concil. Tom 3 p. 596, 597 Epistle, Glorioso & Religioso Imperatori Con∣stantino Monomacho, beginning thus: Quantas gratias referre jugiter debeamus cre∣atrici, & gubernatrici omnium sanctae & individuae Trinitati,1 Cor. 4. super inenarrabili dono ejus,Eph. 1. quo operatur omnia in omnibus, etiam ex tua devotione et religiosa industria, gloriosissime Fili atque Serenissime Imperator, perpendere possumus quare talem nostris exhibuit, et grata pietate providit diebus, cujus fida ope statum Sanctae et Catholicae Ecclesiae relevari, et terreni Imperii rempublicam meliorari confidamus. Tu enim post nimium longas et perniciosas discordias, primus pacis et concordiae monitor, portitor, et exoptatus exactor efficeris; & cum ipso vase electionis humillimo Paulo dicere videris:2 Cor. 5. Pro Christo legatione fungen∣tes, tanquam Deo exhortante per nos, obsecramus, reconciliamini propter eum, qui estEph. 2. pax nostra, qui facit utraque unum, &c. After which asserting the Headship and Supremacy of the Church of Rome above other Churches, upon false principles, he subjoynes; Cujus venerabilem faciem tu quoque honorificare dispo∣nis, non ingratus illi, quae tuum verticem diademate terreni Principatus decenter insignivit, & tremendum & amandum populis effecit, & ut in sempiternum regnes, Chrismate adoptionis inunxit. Nempe ipsa antiqua & jam emerita Roma illum pri∣mum nobilissimum & religiosissimum Constantinum, cujus genealogia gloriaris & po∣tentia magnificaris, cujusque de nomine dictam urbem famosam regis, temporali∣ter edidit, nutrivit, provexit, & super omnes mortales constituit, nec a benefi∣ciis cessavit, donec eundem aeterni regni gloria cumulavit. Unde multimoda gratia∣rum actione tuam excellentiam gloriosissime fili, magnificando, tanto majori super tua devotione, & recognitione replemur gaudio, quanto copiosior animarum numerus ex tuo regimine pendet; (therefore by this Popes confession, this Em∣peror had the chief regiment and care of his Subjects souls) tuoque innititur ex∣emplo. Et ideo non cessamus orare communem Dominum,Prov. 8. per quem Regis reg∣nant, & Principes justa decernunt, ut in suo beneplacito te conservet longaevum, &

Sancta Romana Ecclesia & Apostolica sedes nimium diu obsessa fuit mercenariis et non Pastoribus, a quibus sua, non quae sunt Christi, quaerentibus, devastata jacebat miserabi∣liter hactenus, divinum consilium voluit meam humilitatem sus∣cipere tantae Cathedrae pondus. Quo licet plurimum mei imbecilles prae∣graventur & deprimantur humeri, non parvum nihi subest sanctae spei, quando∣quidem ex utroque latere tales adstant Filii, religione et potentia praeclarissi∣mi. Quapropter devotissime fili, & Serenissime Imperator, collaborare no∣bis dignare ad relevationem tuae Matris Sanctae Ecclesiae, et privilegia dignitatis atque reverentiae ejus, necnon patrimonia re cuperanda in tuae ditionis partibus, sicut manifeste cognoscere po∣teris ex venerabilium praedecessorum nostrorum, seu tuorum scriptis & gestis. Tu ergo magnus successor Magni Constantini, sanguine, nomine et imperio factus, ut fias etiam imitator devotionis ejus erga Apostolicam sedem, ex∣hortamur, et quae ille mirabilis vir post Christum eidem sedi contu∣lit, et confirmavit, et defendit, tu juxta tui nominis etymologiam constanter adjuva recuperare, retinere, et defendere. Ita enim apud Deum singulariter pugnans cognominaberis, quod jamdudum inter homines cog∣nominaris. Alludit ad cog∣nomen Mono∣machus.

He concludes his Epistle to him with these words, and this prayer for him. Benedictus Deus, & Pater Domi∣ni nostri Jesu Christi,2 Cor. 1.

That the chief care, protection, government of the Church of God, the restitution, preservation of its peace, by suppressing Schismes, discords, schismaticks, hereticks, and the open Enemies thereof, and invaders of its priviledges, possessions, belonged to Christian Kings and Emperors, by this Popes own confession, who claimed his power, possessions, from their Donations, and implored their assistance upon all occasions.

This Pope holding a Synod at Florence against this pretended Simony, Pluralities, and Priests wives, Brazuh pharmaco, Hildebrandi impulsu, tactus occubuit, Anno 1058. Where∣upon Hildebrand posting to Rome, Omnes Clericos adesse jussit, praesentesque Sacramen∣to adegit, ne quenquam patiantur in Pontificem eligi, nisi sit ille omnium, adeoque suo etiam consensu, designatus Pontifex. But the Romans mutinying against the Clergy, who en∣deavoured to deprive them of their Votes in the Popes election: Benedictus 10. Pontifex acclamatur, & clamore populari Pontifex habebatur, during Hildebrands ab∣sence at Florence: who posting to Rome, expostulated with the Cardinals for suffe∣ring a Pope to be intruded on them against their Oath, perswading them to elect Ge∣rardus in his place: But fearing and not daring to elect a New Pope at Rome, ob ple∣bis furorem; Senas simul profugiunt, ibique rem perficiunt; Gerardus being there elect∣ed Pope, assumed the name of Nicholaus secundus: This new Pope and his com∣plices, Sutrii pergens constitit, coacto{que} Concilie Benedictum Pontificatu exit, qui factio∣sis ultro cedens,Anno 1059, 1060. returned to Veltras his former Bishoprick by his Successors consent. After which he held a 2d. Synod in Rome, wherein these Decrees were made con∣cerning the future election of Popes, to secure his own Title against Pope Stephen Surius Concil. Tom. 3. p. 599, 600. Centur. Magd. 11. c. 9. si quis pecunia, vel gratia humana, aut populari, militarive tumultu, sine concordi & canonica electione Cardinalium, fuerit in throno Petri collocatus, is non Apostolicus,

This Decree, if Apostolical, Orthodox, made this Pope himself, all his Predecessors, and most of his Successors in the Ro∣man See both Robbers and Apostates; and layd a seditious, schismatical ground for all Christians to rise up tumultuously against most succeeding Pontifs as such, Moreover, Inspector Deo est statutum, ut Electio Romani Pontificis in potesta∣te Cardinalium Episcoporum sit; ita ut si quis Apostolicae sedis sine praemissa con∣cordi & canonica electione eorum, ac deinde sequentium ordinum Religiosorum Clericorum & Laicorum consensu inthronizatur, is, non Papa vel Apostolicus, sed Apostaticus ha∣beatur. This Decree confines the Popes Election only to the Cardinal Bishops, but yet requires the subsequent assent of the inferiour Clergy and people to his in∣thronization. After which they proceeded to take away all Emperors, Kings, Nobles, & Laymens Rights of Patronage and presentations to any Church or Benefice, either with, or without reward. Ut per Laicos nullo modo quilibet Clericus aut Presbyter ob∣tineat Ecclesiam, nec gratis, nec precio. And to make this bitter pill to be swallowed with less regret, they subjoyned this plausible Decree thereto against Pluralities, Nec aliquis Presbyter duas Ecclesias simul obtineat: not with intention conscientiously to ob∣serve it, but to raise moneys by dispensing with it: Next they decreed, Ut cujuslibet ordinis Clericos Laici non judicent, nec de Ecclesis ejiciant, to exempt all Clerks from Secular Jurisdiction, though never so criminal, vitious, or indirectly intruded in∣to Churches by the Pope or other Prelates. Ut nullus Laicus ad quemlibet gradum Ecclesiasticum repente promoveatur, nisi post mutatum habitum secularem, diuturna con∣versatione inter Clericos fuerit comprobatus; Though many of their Popes were meer Lay-men when first elected; Yea one of them, Pope Joan (alias John the 8.) a wo∣man, a most notorious Whore not a man, so long conversant with Clergymen un∣der the disguise of a Male, in mans apparrel, that she was advanced to the Popes un∣erring chair, Anno 855. and not long after (as theCaxtons Chr pars. 5.

Laurentius Surius gives us this further account of Pope Nicholas the 2d. his Decree against Symoniacks, and several resolutions relating thereunto: Dominus Papa Nicholaus Synodo in Basilica Constan∣tiniana praesidens dixit; Erga Simoniacos nullam misericordiam in dignitate servanda habendam esse, decernimus, sed juxta Caenonum sanctiones, & decreta Sanctorum Patrum, eos omnino damnamus ac deponendos esse Apostolica authoritate sancimus. De iis autem qui non per pecuniam, sed gratis sunt a SIMONIACIS ordinati, quae quaestio a longo tempore est diutius ventilata, omnem modum dubietatis absolvimus, it a ut super hoc Capi∣tulo nominem deinceps ambigere permittamus. Quia igitur usque adeo haec vene∣nata pernicies hactenus inolevit, ut vix quaelibet Ecclesia valeat re∣periri quae hoc morbo non sit aliqua ex parte corrupta, eosque usque modo gratis sunt a Simoniacis consecrati, non tam censura justitiae quam misericordiae intuitu in acceptis ordinibus manere permittimus: nisi forte alia culpa ex vita eorum contra canones eis existat. Tanta quippe talium multitudo est, ut dum rigorem Canonici vigoris super eos servare non possumus, necesse sit, ut dispensatorie ad piae condescentionis studium nostros animos ad praesens inclinemus. Ita tamen authoritate Sanctorum Apostolorum Petri & Pauli omnimodis interdicimus, ne aliquando aliquis Successorum nostrorum, ex hac nostra permissione regulam sibi vel alicui assumat vel praefigat: quia hoc non authoritas antiquorum Patrum jubendo aut concedendo promulgavit, sed temporis nimia necessitas permittendum a nobis extorsit. De caetero autem
si quis hinc in posterum ab eo quem Simonaicum esse non dubitat, se consecrari permiserit, & consecrator, & consecratus non disparem damnationis sententiam subeat, sed uter{que} depositus poenitentiam agat, & privatus a propria dignitate persistat. Nihilominus authoritate A∣postolica decernimus, quod in aliis Conventibus nostris decrevimus, ut si quis pecunia vel gratia humana, vel populari seu militari tumultu, sine concordi & canonica electione ac benedictione Cardinalium Episcoporum, ac deinde sequentium ordinum religiosorum Cleri∣corum fuerit Apostolicae sedi inthronizatus, non Papa vel Apostolicus, sed Apostaticus habeatur, liceatque Cardinalibus Episcopis cum religiosis, et Deum timentibus Clericis et Laicis, invasorem etiam cum anathemate, cum humano auxilio et studio a sede Apostolica re∣pellere, et quem dignum judicaverint praeponere. Quod si hoc intra ur∣bem persicere nequiverint, nostra authoritate Apostolica extra urbem congregati in loco qui eis placuerit, eligant, quem digniorem & utiliorem Apostolicae sedi perspexerint, concessa ei authoritate regendi & disponendi res & utilitatem Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae, secuduns quod ei melius vidibitur juxta qualitatem temporis, quasi jam omnino inthronizatus sit: which justifies the Emperors future deposing of such Popes by force of armes. This Pope, was the first I meet with, who by these Constitutions robbed the Em∣peror, inferiour Clergy, Nobles and Citizens of Rome of their antient Rights and Jurisdictions in the elections of Popes, and vested it only in the Bishops Cardinals, against all former presidents. Our English Apostle John Wickliff asserted, that this electionWickliff Ar∣tic. 40. in Con∣cil. Constanti∣ens. Sss. 8.

Nunc vero Phylacteria sua in tantum dilataverunt, ut non modo Episcopos (quos Episcopellos solent passim vocare) sed Patriarchas, Primates, sed Archipraesules velut infra se positos despiciant, imo se jam ab illis supplicibus propemodum adorari sinant, quin etiam Reges ipsos aequiparare contendant: (After which he displays their other vices.)

No wonder then if Popes elected by these new upstart, reprobate Lucifers, have advanced their thrones above the Stars, and all that is called God, or worshipped; and confederated with Popes to rob all Christian Emperors, Kings, Princes, Nobles, Laymen of their Elections, Patronages, Advowsons, Presentations, Investitures, (under the false Notion of Symony) to in∣grosse them all into the Popes and their own disposals, by way of Provisions, that they alone might have the Monopoly of their sales to enhance the price. Pope Nicolas having made these Decrees by Hildebrands advice, was by divine
retaliation taken in this his own net, thus recorded byIn Gregor. 7. Benno Cardinalis, and In Nichol. 2. p. 208, 209. Platina, Stella, Fasciculus, Tem∣porū, Herman∣nus Schedel.

Postquam sedit Nicolaus, Hildebrandus, quia Papatura adipisci non potuit, ad Archidiaconatum quoquo modo invadendum se convertit. Et Mancium tunc Archidiaconum Romane Ecclesiae multis injuriis afflixit ac circunvenit. Qui victus contumeliis & dolis, atque ejus Hildebrandi pecunia deceptus, ad ultimum concessit, ut illius vice Archidiaconatu fungeretur. Hac concessione arrepta Hilde∣brandus Papam Nicholaum ex improviso aggressus, coegit inverecundis percibus & militum minis, quos pecunia collegerat, metum mortis etiam quibusdam terribilibus significationibus incutiendo, ut eum Archidiaconum ordinaret, atque constitueret. Et post paucos dies, Anno scilicet Domini 1061. ipse Nicholaus defunctus est, veneno (ut dicitur) a Brazulo Hildebrandi complice suffocatus; in pursuance of his own De∣cree. This Pope being thus sent packing by Hildebrand, to make way for himself to possess his See: Cardinales, Hildebrandi ambitionem non ignorantes, Im∣peratorem multis precibus coegerunt, ut eis in Electo suo Parmensi Episcopo Cadolo favorem et aurilium praestaret. Quod factum, cor Hildebrandi altius percussit, & manifeste factus est ex illo die Imperatoris inimicus: Omnia juratae fidelitatis vincula disrupit: & facta conspiratione cam  Impe∣ratoris, & cum Normannis, ut quem Cadolo a Cardinalibus Electo opponeret, Ansel∣mum Lucensem Episcopum decepit, & eum in Papam eligi a quibusdam Romanis fa∣cit, Imperatore neque salutato, neque consulto, ipsumque mutato nomine, Alexandrum secundum vocavit, Anselmum igitur, quem sub dolo Romani elegerant, pariter, & Parmensem Episcopum Cadolum, quibus poterat artibus Hildebranaus vex∣avit: qui utrique succedere anhelabat. Cadolus being dispossed by Alexander, thereupon the Lombards sides with Cadolus by the Emperors consent. Qui magno cum exercitu Romam obsedit: commisso{que} praelio, uno atque altero, cum suis est fuga∣tus. Henricus vero Imperator, ut Schisma tolleretu, Othonem Coloniensem Archiepisco∣pum cum sua authoritate illuc misit. Qui Romam veniens, multis egit de Impe∣ratoris jure in eligendo Pontifice, et in Alexandrum, qui sine consensu ejus electus esset, graviter incusabat. Tunc Hildebrandus ad hominum perni∣ciem natus, & propter victoriam nuperrime partam elatior factus, orationem Archi∣episcopi interrumpit, acriterque tuetur Pontificis partes, Electionem ejus asserens esse apud Clerum. Otho (plus fortassis, in ea re Pontifici quam Imperatori deferens) facile cedit: petit{que} ut Synodus pro sedando Schismate Mantuae congregaretur. In qua constituit Alexander, non esse missam audiendam a Sacerdote Concubinario factam. Filiis tamen Sacerdotum sacris initiari licere permisit, interposita Pontificis authorita∣te. Papam a solis Cardinalibus eligi decrevit: with other particulars which I pretermit. Hereupon, (asDe Romano∣rum Pontificum Actis, l. 5. p. 211. Balaeus observes) His temporibus, (by Hildebrands per∣swasions and instructions) Episcopi plusquam Principes, Regibus imperare ac leges praescribere conantur, decimas{que} magna austeritate extorquent. Haec quoque fuit eorum Vicariorum Christi religio, ut quo ventri luxuique suo satisfacerent, non sunt veriti totas Nationes bellis immiscere. Accedit nuncIn Gregorio 7. Bennonis Cardinalis de A∣lexandro Papa testimonium: Ubi Alexander, tandem intellexit, se dolis & arte ab Hil∣debrando & inimicis Imperatoris Electum atque inthronizatum, quodam die cum intra Missarum solennia sermonem haberet ad populum, praedicavit, se nolle sedere in se∣de Apostolica, absque licentia Imperatoris: Et publice dixit, Se li∣teras hujus rei gratia missurum ipsi Imperatori. (Such was his consci∣entious Loyalty, notwithstanding his predecessor Adrians and the Council of Romes fresh Decrees to the contrary:) Quo audito, Hildebrandus multa murmurando, vix manus, donec missa compleretur, abstinuit. Missa vero expleta, ipsum Alexandrum cum militari manu, ab Altari duxit in Cameram, & nondum exutum Pontificalibus indumentis, pugnis dure colaphizavit, increpans, et improperans, quod vellet inquirere gratiam Imperatoris. Et statuit Hildebrandus, ut ex eo die non darentur ei amplius quam quinque solidi Lucensium denariorum: Et extunc Hildebrandus omnes redditus Romanae Ecclesiae sibi retinuit (Alexandro in vincula conjecto) & immensam pecuniam congregavit.Stela, in Alex∣andro 2. Alexandro igitur sub miserabili ju∣go Hildebrandi Anno Domini MLXXIV.Anno 1074. quodam vespere (non sine toxico for∣talistis) defuncto, eadem hora Hildebrandus a suis Militibus, sine assen∣su Cleri et populi est inthronizatus, timens ne alius per moram eli∣geretur
Contrary to his immediate Predecessors, and his own Decrees. In cu∣jus electione, nullus Cardinalium subscripsit. Ad quam cum veniret Abbas Cassi∣nesis, ait ipse Hildebrandus, Frater nimium tardasti. Respondit Abbas, Et tu Hildebrande nimium festinasti, qui nondum sepulto Domino tuo, Pa∣pae sedem Apostolicam contra Canones usurpasti. Hoc modo inthroni∣zatus Hildebrandus qualiter vixerit, qualiter a se Cardinales, qui testes vitae & Do∣ctrinae ejus esse debuerant, removerit; quam miserabiliter vexaverit, quan∣tis haeresibus mundum corruperit, quanta perjuria, quam immensas proditiones consecraverit, vix a multis describi potest. Clamat tamen altius san∣guis Christianorum eo authore et incentore miserabiliter effusus. Sex aut octo Pon∣tifices (as Benno Cardinalis, Platina, Onuphrius, Balaeus, and others attest in his life) Gerrardi Brazuti Judaei ministerio venenis enecavit, ut ita sterneret ei ad Papatum via. IndeedIn Gregor. 7. Platina,Surius Con∣cil. Tom. 3. p. 602. Surius, and others out of him record, that this Pope was unanimously elected, not only by the Cardinals, (as the forecited late Popes and Councils Decrees prescribed) but likewise by all the several Orders of the Clergy, and of the people of Rome; That, adeptus Pontificatum Gregorius,Fuit is Hen∣ricus 4. Imperator in gratiam cum Gregorio rediit, eundemque in Pontificatu confirma∣vit, ut tum Imperatorum mos erat. But Benno Cardinalis, Balaeus, and most others averr, that this Impostor, Incantator, ac praestigiator Diabolicus, inaudita ty∣rannide Papatum invasit, statim usurpans Pontificiam sedem in ipsius Alexandri defuncti, & latenter per ipsum veneno occisi, obsequiis.

Occidentem adsere omnem potestatem in se transferre, neminem parem nedum superiorem ferre, justa aliorum diminuere, caeteris jus atque honorem praeripere, cuncta in se transferre.

After which he subjoynes, Hildebrandus primus Imperium Pontificium condidit, quod Successores per 150. continenter annos invito mundo, invitis Imperatoribus adeo duxere, ut inferos supe∣ros in servitutem redegerint, atque sub jugum miserint, atque cun∣cta fulmine perterruerint, Quo bruta tellus & vaga fluminae, Quo Styx, & invisi horrida Taenari Sedes, Atlanteusque finis Concutitur; mutant ima summis.

Hildebrandus instabat Imperatori (per literas Pontificalibus Cristis superbas, as others relate) ut ejiceret Episcopos Simoniacos: quod ni faceret, non posse se partes officii sui exequi. Imperator credens, qua∣si ex zelo legis, quasi a throno Dei procederent haec mandata, sine mora obediebat; sine mora, sine discussione, sine judiciario ordine Episcopos ejiciebat: dum per hanc obedientiam se Deo sacrificare existimabat, dum adhuc versutias Hildebrandi minus intelligebat. Hildebrandus vero expulsos a Rege Simoniacos relocabat, & quos Regi infestos reddiderat, eos sibi familiari amicitia reconciliabat, & multis & magnis juramentis sibi fideles & obnoxios efficiens praealiis exaltabat. Et modico tempore iis artibus regia domo perturbata, & pene amicis detituta, sibi vero amicitia majorum principum comparata, ex improviso, sine legitima accusatione, sine cano∣nica vocatione, sine judiciario ordine, obedientem sibi Impera∣torem excommunicat, et regni Principes ab eo separavit. Et cum Apostolus praecipiat,1 Thess. 4. 6. Ne quis circumveniat in negotio fratrem suum; quantum in eo fuit, mortificavit potius quam castigavit.

Grata admodum Gregorio alioqui faciles aures vituperantibus atque criminantibus Caesarem praebere solito, istaec fuere: tanto Cardine rerum nequaquam cessandum arbitrabatur: quippe sibi persuaserat, tempus oportunum venisse, quando Roma∣nos Flamines a servitute vindicaret, Imperatoris jugum, ejus opibus diminutis, excu∣teret, authoritatem antiquaret, omnem potestatem in se transferre liceret, itaque Principatum Pontificalem confirmaret. Nihil speciosius videbatur, quam sublato metu, neminem mortalium formidare. Et ut liberet Ecclesiastica libertate persru atque esse Imperatorem, cujus arma, vis, non metuerentur; ut qui arbitrio Romani Pontificis precario duntaxat regnaret. Gregorius ergo haec mente observans, Saxo∣num animos verbis confirmat, sibi hanc rem curae fore respondet; se propediem in Germaniam profecturum, Concilium totius Imperii in certum diem indicturum, ubi communi consensu de hujusmodi rebus agitetur, pollicetur.

Quia in cujuslibet rei profectu, nec facultas sine voluntate,
nec volantas sine facultate proderit: quod utrumque tu sidelissime (ut arbitramur) aequa∣liter possides: vel ut verius dicamus, licet maximo tibi, maxima non desit facultas, major tamen adhuc maxima facultate (si te benè novimus, si fidem tuam diligenter not avimus) in nostram & regni utilitatem tibi exuberat voluntas; de praeteritis emm fideliter exhibi∣tis, in futuris crescit spes fidelius exhibendis. Tuae autem dilectioni committimus, ne spes nostra sit major fide tua: quia de nullius regni Principum vel Episcoporum fidelitate, quam , majora speramus; sicut bactenus non modo in praeteritorum rerum exhibitio∣ne, verum etiam in sperandarum promissione tua gavisi sumus. Adsic igitur hoc in tem∣port opportuno, tua cum facultate voluntas, quam non modo nostra, verum etiam omnium Episcoporum, fratrumque tuorum, imo totius oppressae Ecclesiae exoptat necessitas. Non e∣tiam hanc oppressionem ignoras; tantum vide, ne oppressae te Ecclesiae subtrahas, sed regno & sacerdotio condolcas; quo utroque, sicut hucus{que} Ecclesia est exaltata, ita nunc heu humili∣atur viduata. Nam unus dum utrumque sibi vendicavit, utrumque dissipavit: nec in uno profuit, qui in neutro prodesse voluit, nec potuit. Et ne diutius notati nomine te suspenda∣mus, accipe quem dicimus, Hildebrandum scilicet, Monachum habitu, quidem dictum Apostolicum, non pastoris cura, sed invasoris violentia Apostolicae sedi prae∣sidentem: & de sede pacis catholicae pacis untae vincula dissipantem, ut tibimet in promptu est scire. Ʋt enim de pluribus pauca referamus, Regnum et Sacerdoti∣um Deo nesciente sibi usurpavit; in quo piam Dei ordinationem contempit, quae non in uno, sed in duobus duo, id est, Regnum et Sacerdotium, principaliter consistere voluit: sicut & ipse Dominus Salvator noster in passione sua, de duorum gladiorum sufficientia typica, intelligi innuit; cui cum diceretur,Luke 22. 38. See here p. 63, 64, 65, 66. Ec∣ce Domine duo gladii hic, respondit, satis est; significans, hac sufficienti dualitate, spi∣ritualem & carnalem glalium in Ecclesia esse gerendum, quibus omne nocivum fore tam putandum: videlieet, Sacerdotali, ad obedientiam Regis pro Deo: regali vero gladio ad explodendos Christi inimicos exterius, et ad obe∣dientiam Sacerdotii, interius, omnem hominem docens fore constringendum: & ita de alia in aliam Charitatem tenderetur, dum nec regnum Sacerdotii, nec Sacerdo∣tium regni honore privaretur. Hanc Dei ordinationem qualiter Hildebrandica insania confuderit, tu ipse nosti, si scire voluisti, nam nullum ejus judicio lice esse Sacerdotem, nisi qui hoc a fastu suo emendicaverit. Me quoque, quem Deus in regnum, non au∣tem illum vocavit in Sacerdotium, quia me de Deo, et non de illo regnare velle vidit, quia ipse me Regem non constituit, regno priva∣re studuit, minitans, regnum animamque mihi se tollere, quorum neutrum concessit. Haec & his similia cum saepius in nostram (ut ipse nosti) contumeliam struxerit, non tamen adhuc sufficere credit, qui de die in diem, nova & ex∣quisita confusionis genera nobis ingerit, ut in nostris nunciis noviter argumentum dedit. Nam Charta exponere non sufficit, qualiter eosdem Nuncios nostros tractaverit, quam indignis modis affecerit,Nota. quam crudeliter eos incarceravit, & carceratos nuditate, frigore, fam, siti, ac plagis contriverit, sicque demum in exemplum per medium Civitatis circum∣ductos, omnibus spectaculum praebere jusserit; ita ut eundem cum Decio Tyranno insanire, & Sanctos assare credas, & dicas. Unde ne pigeat charissime, communi nostrum, scili∣cet & mea & coepiscoporum tuorum petitioni satisfacere, ut in Pentecostem Wormaci∣a venias, & ibi plura, quorum pauca docet Chartula, cum caeteris audias Principibus, & quid agendum sit doceas, rogatus per dilectionem Coepiscoporum, monitus per Ecclesiae militatem, obligatus per vitae nostrae, & regni totius honorem.

The Letters from Rome adde, Monachus desertor est, novis dogmatibus sacrosan∣ctam Philosophiam adulterat, divinas literas falso interpretando suae causae servire cogit, concordiam Collegii scindit, sacra, prophana, divina, humana comnuscet; utrumque juxta polluit, Diabolis, hoc est acerbissimorum hostium spurcissimis crim∣nationibus, iniquorum maledictis aurem commodat & credit, Testis, Judex, Accusator, Inimicus idem est.

Hasce ob causas, sanctis∣simus Imperator, Pontifices, Senatus, populusque Christianus, illum Hildebrandum abdicandum, sibi eundem non placere, neque o∣ves lupo committendas, censent.

Cum primum Ecclesiae gubernaculum invasisses, etsi bene nobis cognitum esset quam illicitam & nefariam rem contra jus & fas familiari tibi arrogantia praesump∣sisses: dissimulanda tamen dispensatoria quadam taciturnitate, tam vitiosa introitus tui exordia putavimus: sperantes videlicet, tam criminosa principia consequentis re∣giminis tui probitate & industria emendata, & aliquatenus obliterata. Verum nunc, ut lamentabilis universalis Ecclesiae status clamat, & deplorat, malis initiis tuis pejo∣res actionum decretorumque tuorum progressus, infelici respondens tenore & per∣tinacia. Cum enim Dominus & Redemptor noster, pacis & charitatis bonum, quasi singularem fidelibus suis characterem impresserit (cujus rei testimonia plura existant quam ut Epistolari brevitate comprehendi valeant) Tu e contrario, dum prophanis studes novitatibus, dum magis amplo, quam bono nomine delectaris; dum inau∣dita elatione, distenderis, veluti quidam signifer Schismatis omnia membra Ecclesiae,1 Tim. 2. 2, 3. quae secundum Apostolum, quietam & tranquillam vitam ante haec tua tem∣pora agebant, Superba crudelitate, crudelique Superbia lacerasti: flammasque discordiae, quas in Romana Ecclesia diris factionibus excitasti, per omnes Ecclesias Italiae, Germaniae, Galliae, Hispaniae furiali dementia sparsisti. Sub∣lata enim quantum fuit, omni potestate ab Episcopis, quae eis divinitus per gratiam Sancti Spiritus, qui maxime in ordinationibus operatur, collata esse dinoscitur, omni∣que rerum Ecclesiasticarum administratione plebeio furori per te attributa, dum nemo jam alicubi Episcopus aut Presbyter est, nisi qui hac indignissi∣sima assentatione a fastu tuo emendicavit, omnem Apostolicae institutio∣nes vigorem, illamque pulcherrimam membrorum Christi distributionem, quam Do∣ctor gentium toties commendat & inculcat, miserabili confusione miscuisti: sicque per haec tua gloriosa decreta (quod sine lachrymis dci non potest) Christi fere no∣men
men perut Quis autem illud pro indignitate rei stupeat, quod novam quandam indebitamque potentiam tibi usurpando arrogas, ut debita univer∣sae fraternitati jura destruas? Asseris enim, cujuscunque nostrûm Parochiani aliquid delictum ad te vel sola faina perveniat, ultra jam non habere quemquam no∣strum aliquam potestatem vel ligandi vel solvendi, extra & praeter te solum, aut eum quem tuspecialiter. spiritualiter ad hoc delegeris. Quae sententia quod omnem insaniam exce∣da, quis in sacris literis eruditus non videat? Quia ergo per hos, aliosque praesump∣tionum tuarum Spiritus, Ecclesiam Dei tam graviter periclitantem, immo fere pessun∣datum diutius tolerare omni malo deterius judicavimus: placuit, ut commni omni∣um nostrum consilio, tibi quod hactenus tacuimus, innocescat: quamobrem nec modo possis, nec unquam potueris Apostolicae sedi praeesse. Tu ipse bonae memoriae N.Nota. Imperatori teipsum corporali Sacramento obstrinxisti, quod nunquam ipso vivente Imparatore, aut Filio ejus Domino nostro Glorioso Rege, qui modo summae rerum praeest, Papatum aut ipse suscipe∣res, aut alium (quantum in te est) suscipere patereris, absque as∣sensu vel laudamento patris, dum viveret. Ad hoc Sacramentum sunt ho∣die plerique Episeopi, qui hoc tunc & oculis suis videre, & auribus audiere. Illud  recordare, quomodo ipse in aliquos ex Cardinalibus, cum ambitio Papa∣tus llaret, ad tollendam aemultationem, hac occasione et conditione ut ipsi hoc sacramento te obligasti, quod nunquam Papatum habiturus esses. Vtraque haec Sacramentorum quam sancte, quam caute observave∣ris, tu videris. Praeterea, cum tempore Nicholai Papae Synodus celebraretur in qua etum viginti Episcopi consederant, sub anathemate hoc statutum et de∣cretum est, ut nullus Papa fieret, nisi per electionem Cardinalium, ex approbationem populi,Nota. et per consensum et authoritatem Regis: atque hujus Concilii seu Decreti tu ipse autor, persuasor, subscriptor∣que fuisti; atque hoc quasi foetore quodam gravissimi scandali, totam Ecclesiam re∣pleiti, de convictu & cohabitationeSee Jac.  alienae mulieris familiariori, quam necesse sit. In qua re verecundia nostra magis quam causa laborat, quamvis haec generalis quere∣la ubique personuerit, omnia Judicia, omnia decreta per foeminas in sede Apostolica acttati, denique per eas totius Orbis & Ecclesiae jura administrari. Nam de inju∣s & coumehis Episcoporum, quos filios meretricum, & id generis indignissi∣me null querimonia sufficit. Quia ergo & introitus tuus tantis perjuriis et Ecclesia Dei tam gravi tempestate per abusidnem novitatum tu∣aru periclitatur, et vitam et conversationem tuam tam multiplici infaa dehonestasti, obedientiam quam tibi nullam promisimus, nec de caetero nullam servaturos esse renunciamus: et quia nemo no∣strum, ut publice declamas, tibi hactenus fuit Episcopus, ita nulli nostrum amodo eris Apostolicus.

HENRICUS, non usurpative, sed pia ordinatione Dei, Rex, Hildebrando jam non Apostolico, sed falso Monacho. Hanc talem pro confusione tua saluta∣tionem promeruisti, qui nullum in Ecclesia ordinem praetermisisti, quem confusionis, non honoris, maledictionis, non benedictionis, participem non feceris. Ut enim de multis, pauca & egregia loquamur; Rectores Sanctae Ecclesiae, videlicet Archiepis∣copos, Episcopos vel Presbyteros, non modo non tangere, sicut Christos Domini non
timuisti; quin sicut Servos, nescientes quid faciat Dominus eorum, sub pedibus tu∣is calcasti, in quorum conculcatione tibi favorem ab ore Vulgi comparasti, quos om∣nes nihil scire, te autem solum omnia nosse judicasti: qua uti{que} scientia non ad aedifica∣tionem, sed ad destructionem uti studuisti, ut jure hoc beatum Gregorium, cujus no∣men tibi vendicasti, de te credamus prophetasse, dicentem sic, Ex affluentia subjectorum plerunque animus Praelati extollitur; existimat se plus omnibus nosse, cum se videat plus om∣nibus posse. Et quidem nos omnia haec sustinuimus, dum Apostolicae sedis honorem con∣servare studuimus: sed tu humilitatem nostram timori fore intellexisti: ideoque et in ipsam regiam potestatem nobis a Deo concessani, exurgere non timu∣isti, quam a nobis auferre ausus es minari, quasi a te nos regnum ac∣ceperimus: quasi in tua, et non in manu Dei sit Regnum vel Imperi∣um, quia Dominus noster Iesus Christus Nos ad regnum, te autem non vocavit ad Sacerdotium. Tu enim his gradibus ascendisti, scilicet astu∣tia, (quod Monachica professio abominatur) pecuniam, pecunia favorem, favo∣re ferrum, ferro sedem pacis adisti: et de sede pacis, pacem turba∣sti: dum subditos in Praelatos armasti; dum Episcopos nostros, a Deo vocatos, tu non vocatus spernendos docuisti: dum Laics Ministerium eorum super Sacerdotes usurpasti, ut ipsi deponant vel condemnent, aut ipsos de manu domini per impositio∣nem manuum Episcoporum docendos acceperant. Me quoque (licet indignus inter Christianos sum ad regnum vocatus) te teste, quem Sanctorum Patrum traditio soli Deo judicandum docuit, pro aliquo crimine nisi a fide (quod absit) exorbitaverim, deponendum asseruit; Cum etiam Iulianum Aposta∣tam prudentia sanctorum Episcoporum, non sibi, sed soli Deo depo∣nendum commiserit. Ipse vero quid verus Papa beatus Petrus, clamat?1 Pet: . 17. De∣um timete, Regem honorificate. Tu autem quia Deum non times, me con∣stitutum ejus inhonoras. Unde Beatus Paulus, ubi Angelo de Coelo, alia si praedicaverit, non pepercit, te quoque in terris alia docentem non excepit: ait enim, Gal: 1. 8, Siquis vel Ego, vel Angelus de Coelo, praeter id quod evangelizavimus, vobis evangeli∣zaverit, anathema sit. Tu igitur hoc Anathemate, et omnium Episcopo∣rum nostrorum judicio damnatus, Descende; vendicatam tibi sedem Apostolicam relinque; alius in solium beati Petri ascendat, qui nulla violentia religionem palliet, sed cati Petri sanam doctrinam doce∣at.

Appendix, An. 1176. p. 346. Bertoldus Constantiensis, thus relates the proceedings; His temporibus Henricus Rex per Simoniacam haeresin Ecclesiam faedare non cessavit, scilicet pro pretio Episcopatus, Abbatias, & alia hujusmodi investiendo, & inter alia crimina eti∣am excommunicatis communicando. Cum autem Rex jamdudum saepe a Papa praemonitus se corrigere nollet, & Papa in admonendo nihil proficeret; ad ultimum mandavit ei, quod in Romana Synodo proxima eum excommunicaturus esset nisi re∣sipisceret. Quae Legatio in oclava Nativitatis Domini ad Regem pervenit. Unde Rex in Septuagesima apud Wormatiam colloquio facto, & aliam in Lombardia apud Pla∣centiam, omnesque quos potuit, obedientiam praedictae Papae exhibendam abiurare fecit; & missa Legatione ad Romanam Synodum, quae in proxima Quadra∣gesima celebrata est, ipsum Apostolicum ab Apostolica sede contumaciter jussit descendere. Sed missi ejus turpissime in Synodo tractati, vix a Romanis, adjuvante Papa, evaserunt. Ipsum autem Re∣gem, Synodo iudicante, fidelitate hominum, regno, et commu∣nione privavit, et omnes ei ad Regnum juratos, juramento absol∣vit. Omnes Episcopos qui Regi sponte contra Papam fuerunt, officio & communione priva∣vit; reliquis autem, qui inviti eidem corspirationi intererant, usque ad festivitatem Sancti Petri inducias dedit.Hist. Angl: Anno 1977. p. 10. & Schaff∣naberg. Anno 1076. Matthew Paris registers; Imperator collecto Wormatiae 24. Episcoporum & multorum Concilio Principum decerni jubet, omnia Decreta et facta Gregorii Papae (qui prius Hildebrandus dicebatur) debere irritari: ibique omne Concilium, praeter paucos, Hildebrandum ab∣juravit, &c. The Pope in the mean time to engage the Romans to side with him against the Emperor,Aventinus Annal. Boiorum l. 5. p. 45. Cent. Magd. 11. c. 8. col. 424, 425. Romae concionem in Templum vocat, cum Sacerdotibus, equitatu, plebe, Senatu agit; Caput mundi (inquit) Romani rerum Domini, victor gentium populus, et Imperium et Pontificatum, in quos li∣buerit, transferre potest: (where then is the Popes Supremacy, and Cardinals right of electing Popes without the Romans precedent consent or privity?) Sicut ante ducentos & septuaginta quinque annos, a Gracis in Germanos transtulit: (therefore not Pope Leo the 3d.See here p. 178, 180. as Pontificians falsly boast.) Quemadmodum militem ignavum Imperator exauthorare potest, ita milti ducem in injustum deserere licet. Vestrum munus est Quirites, vestrum est beneficium, vestro sanguine atque sudore tantum partum Imperium, quod bonum, faustum foelixque sit. Mecum, filii charissimi decernetis, quinam Romae posthac regnarit, nec me superstite Rer libe∣ros populo, quem non creavit, imponetur. Post haec Gregorius millia talentum, quindicies viritim distribuit. Ea a Normannis & Machtylda contributa fuêre. Opes quoque Ecclesiesticas, quibus hacterus pauperes alebantur, militibus & rei bellicae peritis largitus est. Quod & Hildebrandini, Gerochus & Paulus non inficias eunt, & hic tanquam benefatum excusat, & id licere defendit. Romanus ergo hoc donativo oppig∣neratos, specioo nomine libertatis inescatos, Gregorius facile ad se deficere persuasit. Dum autem talia fiunt, Rulandus Sacerdos Parmensis, Literas Imperatoris, Concilii{que} (Wormatiae) Decretum deferens: aedem sacram ingreditur, ad Gregorium in Ro∣mana Synodo consedentem pertulit, & absque omni salutationis honore,See Paulus Bernreidensis, vita Gregorii 7. p. 83. Tibi (ad Hil∣debrandum inquit) Caesar noster Christianissimus, Sanctissimi Italiae, Germaniae, Galliae Episcopi, sacer orbis Christianus praecipiunt, ut te munere, quod astu, pecunia, gratia occupasti, confestim abdices. Nec enim fas est invitis illis,Nota te adversus authoritatem Imperato∣ris, contra Christianae Ecclesiae Decretum, ovili Dei ultra incuba∣re. Deinde ad caeteros versus; Pientissimi (inquit) fratres, Pa∣storem jure vestro deligite: deinde sacratissimus Consul, Tribunus & Prin∣ceps vester, more majorum author fiet: Iste enim Hildebrandus, neque Pastor, neque Pater, neque Pontifex; Fur est, Lupus, latro atque
Tyrannus. Vix haec fatus erat, Joannes Portuensis prosilit, facto impetu surgens, & immensa voce clamavit, capiatur, capiatur ingeminat. Fit tumultus: Urbis prae∣fectus & caeteri Parmensem gladiis strictis circumsistunt, in Temploque confodere parant, Ille vix ope Gregorii (ut Paulus refert) evasit. Post haec Pontifex multis verbis, amarissime in Caesarem perorat; flagitia, quibus a Saxonibus inustus erat, aperte dicit, crimina memoriter recitat: Tum ab omnibus (uti mos gentis: est) acclamatum, Im∣manis Tyrannus a fastigio rerum deturbetur: truculentissimus rei publicae et Ecclesiae hostis, sacro ense cum sociis et consultoribus feriatur, atrocissimum facinus ferro recidatur. Alius qui Romano Imperio dignus sit, substituatur. Gallina tum Romae ovum serpente quasi arte celatum, peperit. Gregorius posteaquam hujuscemodi dicta sunt, ovum Imperium, serpentem Regem, qui Romae domicilio Imperii conterendus sit, interpretatur. Multa dein de innocentia & potestate sua praefatur. Deinde Hilde∣brandus, velut alter Machabaeus (ut, inquit Gerhobus Reicherspergensis) gladium arripi∣ens; B. Petri Apostolorum Principis nomine invocato, Caesarem Anathemate, his conceptis verbis percellit. Henrico Regi, silio Henrici Imperatoris, qui contra tuam Ecclesiam inaudita superbia insurrexit, totius regni Teutonicorum, & Ita∣liae Gubernacula contradico, et omnes Christianos a vincula Iura∣menti quod sibi fecere vel facient, absolvo; et ut nullus ei sicut Regi serviat interdico. Atque ita absolvit omnes a juramento qui fidem Regi juraverant, ut contra eum impelleret absolutio quos fidei tenuit obligatio. Annal. Boio∣rum, l. 5. p. 453, 454. Johannes Aventinus in his Annals, presents us with this larger, and more particular relation of Hildebrands invectives and proceeding against the Emperor, after his sentence denounced against him in this Synod, what sad effects they produced, and what opinion most sober disingaged men had thereof. Postremo ubi hujuscemodi multa Gregorius dixit, concionem ut bono animo sit, & se Christo propitio, fortiter ad resistendum sacrilego, lascivo, temerario, injusto, imperito, superbo, avaro, crudeli, impuro inveni paret, cohortatur. Nordmannos, Mach∣tyldam, Saxones armis invictos, divi Petri rebus studere, alios haud dubie ful∣mine sacro attonitos causam justiorem secuturos; beatos denique esse proponit, qui persecutionem patiantur. Post haec Concilio dimisso, sexcenta fulmina, totidem tonitrua, diram gradinem, bullas appellant, in Galliam, Germaniam, Italiam mittit. Docet, a se Regem qui Christianam Philosophiam contemnat, Templum subverat Haereticorum author sit et consectaneus, execratuni, regnoque ab dicatum. Omnes qui in ejus verba Religione adacti jurarint, et Sa∣cramento solutos esse, commemorat. Exinde se Majorum vestigia, Pa∣trum scita, placita Magistorum Ecclesiae, legem divinam, summum coelestis Thesauri jus, se insequi. Christum Dominum Deum nostrum D. Petro, ejus{que} successoribus Ro∣manis Episcopis censuram totius orbis humani detulisse, eosdenque caelitus consti∣tutos Censores esse, qui judicarent de moribus, deCuria Coelesti, atque Spiritibus aeter nis, nedum mortalibus. In arcanis sacrae Historiae contineri, divina oracula esse; Tu es Petrus, & super hanc Petram aedisicabo Ecclesiam meam, & portae inferi non prae∣valbunt adversus eam;Ma 16. 18. ▪ & Tibi dabo Claves Regni coelorum, Quodcunque ligaveris su∣per terram, erit ligatum & in coelis. Nemo omnium (inquit Septimus) ne Reges qui∣dem atque Imperatores hic excipiuntur. Recitat inde veterum gesta, ubi legamus Hyldericum a Romano Pontifice non ob flagitia, sed quod inutilis foret, regno amo∣tum; Francos{que} jurejurando, quo illi astricti erant, a Primario Urbis Sacerdote absolu∣tos; ab eodem Pipinum Regem substitutum esse. Imperatoribus Theodosio, Arcadio, Philippo, Anastasio, Ambrosium, Innocentium, Constantinum, Anastasium Episcopos sacris interdixisse. Addit, in gestis divi Peteri contineri, ejus cui Pontifex maximus infensus sit, sermonem, conspectum, tanquam dirae contagionis pestem, vitandum esse. Pro∣inde concludit, qui quidem animam suam salvam esse velit, Regi devoto per sacro∣sanctam Religionem audiens dicto non sit; imo Vniversi Imperata mandata{que} de∣trectent rebellionem{que} faciant. Saxonas quoque, veteres amicos Gregorius mune∣ribus explet. Neminem spernendum, neminem contemnendum esse decernit; quae∣cunque potest largiendo, pollicendo parare, nequaquam cunctatur. Scinditur in contraria populus Germanus studia. Principes apud Oppenhaim, oppidum superioris Germaniae, Rhenum continuum coeunt; pars, sicut Hugo Alsatius, ob egestatem
atque inimicitiam (nemo enim est qui omnibus placeat, aut denique hoste careat) omnia misceri bello, ubi ditarentur, ac vindictam sumerent, omnia Marte, cui cuncta licent, ardere avebant. Rudolphus Burgundionum, ac Suevorum regulus, senectute ve∣nerabilis domi forisque praeclarus, caeteris Principibus bonis artibus praestans, Cui Soror Caesaris nuptum collocata erat, cum Berchtoldo a Zaringen genero suo, cum hostibus, quos tamen maxima clade pro Caesare fratre Uxoris suae pugnans affecerat, spe Regni inescatus, sentire caepit. Welpho quoque Dux Boiorum nova molitur. Si∣gefridus Mogontinus Archimystes, Hermannus Mediomatricum, Albertus Van∣gionum Episcopus, Willelmus Hersauentium Monachorum antistes in Boiaria, Altmannus genere Saxo Bathavensis Pontifex, cum Gebhardo Suevo Juvavensium Pa∣store, Adalberone Boio, clarissimis Natalibus orto Wurtzeburgensium primario Sa∣cerdote, condiscipulis suis (quippe eodem tempore Lutetiae Parisiorum literis operam dederant) sub toga & censura Sanctissimorum Patrum, melius quam sub armis & strepitu forensi Caesarum, tranquillitati & Reipublicae Christiane consultum iri arbi∣trabantur. Atque hi omnes quos commemoravimus, ad Saxonas sine cunctatione, deserta Caesaris optimatiumque causa, deficiunt, ad praetextum mutatae voluntatis re∣ligionem obtendunt. Hainricum communi consilio abjurant, se perpetuo ejus fore hostes, quoad vita suppetat, jure jurando sanciunt. Postea arma capessunt, Caesari insidiantur, ejus rebus studentes oppugnant, omnia tumultu, cuncta terrore & luctu complentur. Caedes, incendia fiunt; insontes & qui neutri parti favebant, qui idem Regi servabant, rebellare recusabant, pacem & otium bello praeferrebant, armis se commiscere abnuebant, Simonaici Nicolaitae Haeretici appellantur, proscribuntur, in sceeratorum numero habentur, aris sacris, convivio, colloquio, suppliciis, conspe∣ctu a conjuratis arcentur. Sacerdotes, Monachi, Episcopi, fratres Germani, amici, cognati, affines, liberi, parentes, miles, tribunus, herus, famulus, pueri, puellae, con∣juges, populus, Principes inter se discordant, dissentiunt publice, privatim altercan∣tur, rixantur, pugnant, belligerantur, invicem mutuis vulneribus, caede, parricidio, incendiis, rapina conflictantur: agri vastantur, fana spoliantur, aerarium diripitur, fiscus exinanitur, villae incenduntur, a designe concremantur, urbes, castella vi ex∣pugnantur, leges silent, arma fervent, omne jus in viribus est. Quicquid victori col∣libuisset, victus patitur, virgines rapiuntur, liberi a complexu parentum avellun∣tur, matres familiae vi constuprantur: terra, flumina, humano cruore rubescunt. A∣nimae cum corporibus intereunt, ad inferos raptantur, aeternis suppliciis mactantur. VVurizeburgenses, Vangiones, Mediomatrici, Bathavi, Salesburgenses Episcopos suos exigunt, quod contra instituta Majorum Civibus suis suadebant, solemne fidei pol∣luere, cujus Germaniae populos patientissimos esse inter illustres gravesque rerum authores, licet hostes nostros convenit. Pastores igitur illi extorres, sine lare, sine ovibus errabundi, destituti ovili, ad Saxoniam se conferunt. Plerique tum pri∣vatim, publice indignum facinus clamitant, pro concione Gregorio maledicunt, Hildebrando male precantur, Antichristum esse praedicant; pietatis sub specie (inquibant) debacchatur, honestis nominibus bo∣num Publicum simulat, titulo Christi negotium Antichristi agitat. In Babylonia,2 Thess. 2 in Templo Dei sedet, super omne id quod colitur, extollitur, quasi Deus sit, se errare non posse, gloriatur: In excolenda gloria sua pertinacis spei, at∣que concupiscentiae Imperatoris suo arbitrio constituendi, se devovet; homines non peccatis, sed lege Christi atque Sacramentis solvit, pacem, atque pietatem religionis nostrae labefactat, bella, seditiones concitat, stupro, caedi, perjuriis, perfidiae, rapinis, incendio ambitionem suam occulendam, fabulas comminiscitur, annales corrumpit, res gestas invertit, sed etiam coelestia oracula adulterat; divinas Literas falso inter∣pretando suae libidini servire cogit, sacram Historiam lacerat, inter mulierculas de sacris Philosophatur literis. Quicquid dixerit, Legem Dei putat; ad aviditatem suam incongrua conquirit testimonia, sententias depravat, ad voluntatem suam Scriptu∣ram trahit repugnantem. Nimium sibi de Pharisaeorum supercilio sumit, ut quos∣que damnare vel solvere arbitretur, cum apud Deum, non sententia Sacerdotis sed vita hominis quaeratur. Praeterea Hildebrandus ille divinae Majestati refragatur, Christianissimo Principi divinitus constituto, et a Deo inaugura∣to resistit: versutus, fallax, obscurus, callidus, imperium Orbis, ti∣tulo Christi, sub ovina pelle, ambit. Alios, pecudes ignavas, stultos,
stipites, caudices, Asinos qui ejus Sycophantias vaframentaque non intelligant, pu∣tat. Huc omnes nervos intendit, ut Ducem gregis oppresso in ordinemque redacto, in oves desertus praesidio Imperatoris licentius impuniusque grassetur, SiRom. 13.  Omnis potestas a Deo est, maxima quoque, nempe Caesarea ab eo sit necesse est, Joan. 6. 15 Christus cum eum populum rebus imponere conaretur, aufugit; &Lu. 12. 13. duos de nae∣reditat ambigentes, qui eum arbitrum ceperant, ad Caesarem cui Imperium Or∣bis terrarum commissum est; ablegavit.

Flagitium hujuscemodi Hildebrandi inexpiabile, scelus hactenus inauditum, procul ab Orbe Germano abigendum, ense, (quem Imperator supremus ad vindictam malorum Caesari tradit) resecandum; lupus sub ovina pelle saeviens, ferro tollendus.

Et si ea quae scimus, bene, recte, sapienterque in celebri Romano coetu summa prudentia, summo consilio gesta sunt: tamen accepi nos contra pietatem Christianam egisse videri plerisque, qui egregium sane facinus, velut ab odio & livore, ab Superbia atque aviditate profectum, carpunt, abominantur. Quamobrem rationem actorum reddere, rem ordine explicare placuit. Teste conscientia nostra, nihil invidiae, nihil simultati, nihil ambitioni datum est. Quicquid hactenus actum est, amore divinae justitiae feci. Dum adhuc privati essemus, vocabamur amici parentum regis, quem crebro ac frequenter, & amice Literis familia∣ribus commonuimus, ut resipisceret, eundem per Natales clarissimos, per avitam pater∣nam{que} gloriam & virtutem, per salutem, vitam, ac majestatem imperii saepius obtestati sumus, ut rumorem de ejus sceleribus (quae Deus ptohibeat ut edere in vulgus velim) dissipatum, falsum esse factis coargueret. Idem  Pontificatum Max. adepti, jam communis ejus animi parens factitavimus; Ipse itidem subinde nobis rescripsit, aeta∣tem, fortunam, potentiam paucorum, qui summam Imperii obtinerent, excusavit. Idcirco purpuratos quosdam; quorum consilio Sacerdotia, Pontificatus, contubern Monachorum vaenibant, ac lupi templis non pastores praeficiebantur, repetundarum postulavimus, condemnavimus. Postremo illos in malo obstinatissimos execrati su∣mus. Henrico uti illos aula, praetorio, curia, sermone exigeret, praecipimus. Verum enimvero tantum abfuit ut nobis recte consultanti obtemperaverit, uti omnes Italiae, plerique Galliae atque Germaniae Episcopi, ejus suasu atque instinctu, jugum D. Petri a Christo cervicibus ovium impositum excusserint, Censuram Romanorum Pontificum re∣jecerint, & ut paucis summam scelerum, illius explanem, Primo eos quos captae pecuniae accersivimus, in numero sceleratorum impiorum{que} computavimus, devitare noluit, Deinde, non solum nullam prae se fert spem resipiscendi, sed subnotari etiam a quo∣piam suos mores gravi & iniquo patitur animo. Postremo, templum divinum dissensi∣one labefactare, discordiae mala serere studet. Neque precibus, neque minis ad bonam frugem commovetur. Hasce ob causas eundem a Societate sacrosanctae concionis amo∣vimus, ex albo Christianorum erasimus, ut qui sponte recte facere negligit, hac contu∣melia coactus officium suum, & quod se dignum est, faciat. Si quidem ipse servari (quod Deus avertat) non vult, & omnino ad perniciem suam per praeceps tendit, nos qui Pa∣stores ejus, & rationem Deo de ejus anima reddituri sumus, desidiae atque socordiae convinci, ac perinde perire nolumus. Quid si utique quispiam, non tam Judicio, quam morbo animi nos uti, nostramque sententiam injustam esse existimaret, si talis est, ut doceri queat, sacras literas, decreta Magistrorum, Ecclesiae consulta, veterum annales nobiscum evolvat, comperiet pro certo, nos plus aequo justoque humaniores, ne di∣cam segniores fuisse. Quanquam neminem omnium esse credam qui mecum animo dissentiat, tametsi quae sentiat palam eloqui forsitan non audeat. Enimvero si ille a nobis injuste hoc fulmine afflatus foret, tamen eum supplicem venire opor∣teret, veniam atque piaculum, quo solveretur petere. Proinde, pientissimi filii,
qui magis Deum quam homines timetis, qui justitiam regi, veritatem irae praefer∣tis, bono estote animo, labore, patientia, factis fortibus vires exercete, bonis prae∣ceptis obtemperate, fortiter adversus insanos facite. Magnae curae magna merces est. Immortalis Imperatoris partes defenditis, qui si caepto quoad vita fuppetat perseve∣raveritis, immortalitate, praemio virtutis vestrae vos condonabit. Equidem perpe∣petuo Deum Opt. Max. deprecor, ut vobis virtutem praestet, regem ad sanitatem re∣dire cogat: tunc plane intelliget, me & vos longe eum magis amasse, majoremque gra∣tiam ab eo inibimus, quam illi qui animo indulgentes, assentando, palpando, adulan∣do perversam gratiam gratificantur. Si ille resipuerit, Omnium quae adversus me ges∣serit, oblivionem decernam, & consilio vestro cum eo in gratiam redibo, in Templum∣que divinum reducam. Sub idem tempus idem Gregorius Saxonas socios{que} certiores facit Romanis Concilium Augustam indictum displicere; tantam rem Romae, (ubi penetrale Religionis nostrae, se∣des & domicilium Imperii sit) transigendam esse; se tamen, licet invitis Romanis, Mantuam, quae Machtyldae pareat, profecturum, ubi bene inter bonos agier liceat. Mittuntur igitur a conjuratis ad Hildebrandum, Maugoldus Veringensis dynasta, frater Hermanni historici, Aribertus mysta, cum aliis compluribus, qui Pontificem Max. in Germaniam deducant.

The insolent Pope receiving the Emperors Embassie by the Arclib. of Triers, and others, returned this insolent answer at first (as Lamb. Schafnabergensis and others record) Si veraciter, inquit, facti poenitet, Coronam et caetera regni insignia, in argumentum verae et ex animo factae poe∣nitudinis, nostrae potestati dedat, et se post tam contumax admissum, Regio nomine et honore deinceps indignum profiteatur. Durum nimis hoc visum est Legatis: Cumque vehementer insisterent, ut sententiam temperaret, nec calamum conquassatum judicii austeritate penitus contereret; Vix & aegre tandem exoratus annuit; ut cominus veniret, & si veram pro admissis poe∣nitenam gereret, culpam quam sedi Apostolicae contumeliam irrogando contraxe∣rat, sedis Apostolicae decretis nunc obediendo expiaret. Hereupon the Emperor, by the Popes command, passing into Italy with an Army, came to Canusium with all expedition, where the Pope then was with the Countesse Machtylda, & cum Castellum triplici muro septum esset, intra secundum murorum ambitum receptus, foris derelicto omni comitatu suo, deposito cultu & ornamento regio, nihil praefe∣rens regium, nihil ostentans pompaticum, nudis pedibus (ut oppidanos ad miseri∣cordiam commoveret) jejunus a mane usque ad vesperam spectabat Romani Pon∣tificis sententiam praestolando, suppliciterque intromitti petebat. Hoc secundo, hoc tertio die fecit: Denegatum ingressum aequo animo tulit, aut tulisse dissimulavit, quamvis aspera esset hyems, & gelu cuncta rigescerent.Ante dies septem, quam finem Janus haberet, ante suam faciem concessit Papa venire Regem cum plantis nudis, a frigore captis; In cruce se jactans Papae, saepissime clamans, Parce beate Pater, pie parce mihi peto plane. Papa videns stentem miseratus ei, Satis est, est. Nam benedixit eum, Missam cantavit, corpus dedit et Deitatis. Domuizo Presby∣ter, l. 2.  Vita Mathildis Comitissae, c. 1. Ingolstad: 1612. p. 186. In suburbio quidem op∣pido triduo immuratus, continuo veniam petens, perversoris judicis injuriam et violentiam patienter, et publice, et cum lachrymabili af∣flictione, nudis pedibus, et cum laneis vestibus, hyeme praeter sol∣tum aspera, apud Canusium, spectaculum Angelorum factus et homi∣num, et Hildebrandi ludibrium triduo permansit: During which time (as Johannes Aventinus relates) nunciari Pontifici jubet, Caesarem adesse, ut pacem cum eo faciat bonorum virorum arbitratu, & salvo rerum statu; scilicet, ne sanguis Christianus effundatur, neve stupra, incendia, parricidia, praedae (quae licentia etiam belli justi impune committuntur) in populo Dei fiant, edantur: Vnum postulare,
ne contra fas jusque maledictis acerbissimorum hostium magis, quam innocenti sibi credatur. Optimum quemque vituperationibus vulgi imperiti, nedum inimicorum expositum esse, praecipue eum, qui in rerum fastigio, quasi illustri loco & theatro collocatus, omnibus pateat. Ita humana sunt, nemo est qui universis complaceat. Gregorium quoque vulgo male audire atque castigari, quod familiarius frequentius∣que secreto atque in occulto, quam tantum Pontificem deceat, cum Maechtylda col∣loquatur. Saxonum Legati, qui praesentes erant, intercedunt, ne pax fiat, summo∣pere laborant. Quamobrem toto triduo Caesar, in conspectum Pontificis non est admissus. At Hugo Monachorum Cluniacensium Antistes, caeteriquae boni minis, precibus hortari, suadere, orare, terrere, quovis modo instare, vociferari, pervica∣ciam hanc Tyrannidem appellare, non desistere, donec pepulere, ut Gregorius tandem rogatu Machtyldis, Adlai Sabaudiensis Comitis, & Clumacensis Abbatis, quarto die introductus, absolvitur, & Ecclesiae reconciliatur, upon unreasonable conditions Lambertu Schanaber∣gensis Hist. An∣no 1077. Centur. Magd. 11. cap. 8. col. 431, 432. Quarto demum die in conspectum ejus admissus, post multas hinc inde dictas sen∣tentias, his postremo conditionibus excommunicatione absolutus est, ut die & loco quemcunque Papa designasset, evocatis ad Generale Concilium Teutonicis Princi∣pibus praesto esset, & accusationibus quae intenderentur, responderet: ipso Papa, si ita expedire videretur, cognitore causarum assidente, & ad ejus sententiam, vel reti∣neret regnum, si objecta purgasset, vel aequo animo amitteret, si probatis criminibus regio deinceps honore indignus, juxta Ecclesiasticas leges decerneretur, nullam sive retento, sive amisso regno, hujus injuriae vindictam a quopiam hominum in perpetuum exacturus. Usque ad eam autem diem, qua causa ejus legitime discussa terminaretur, nulla Regno cultus ornamenta,Nota. nulla regiae dignitatis insignia sibi adhiberet, nihil circa rerum publicarum administrationem, juxta consuetudinem suo jure ageret, nihil quod ratum fore oporteat decer∣neret. Postremo, praeter regalium servitiorum exactionem, quibus necessario ipse & sui sustentandi essent, nihil regium, nihil publicum usurparet; omnes etiam qui ei sub jure jurando fidem dirissent ab hujus sacramenti viu∣culo, et conservandae erga cum fidei debito, apud Deum, et apud homines interim liberi expeditique manerent. Rupertum Babenbergensem Episcopum, & Udalricum de Cosheim, & caeteros, quorum consiliis se, remque publi∣cam prodidisset, a sua in perpetuum familiaritate amoveret. Quod si purgatis quae objicerentur, potens confortatusque in regno perstitisset, subditus Romano Pontifici semper, dictoque obtemperans foret, et ad corrigenda quaecunque in regno ejus contra Ecclesiasticas leges prava consue∣tudine inolevissent, consentiens ei, et pro virili proportione coope∣rator existeret. Ad ultimum, si quid horum praevaricaretur, irritam fore hanc quae nunc tantopere expetita sit, anathematis absolutio∣nem. Quinimo jam pro convicto, confessoque habendum esse, nec ultra pro asserenda innocentia sua, audientiam impetraturum, Principesque regni omni deinceps quaestione, cuncta juris jurandi religione liberatos, regem alium, in quem communis electio con∣sensisset, creaturos esse. Gratanter Rex accepit conditiones, & servaturum se omnia quam sanctissime poterat assertionibus promittebat. Nec tamen promitten∣ti temere fides habita est: sed Abbas Cluniacensis, quoniam Jurare Monasticae re∣ligionis obtentu detrectabat, fidem suam coram oculis omnia cernentis Dei interpo∣suit. Episcopus quoque Citicensis, & Episcopus Vercellensis, & Azzo Marchio & a∣lii conventionis ejus Principes, allatis Sanctorum reliquiis, sub Jure jurando confir∣maverunt, facturum esse quae pollicebantur; nec aliqua rerum asperitate, vel casuum varie succedentium mutabilitate ab sententia deducendum. Upon consideration of these premises,Cent.

Pope Gregory himself in his Letters to the Nobles of Germany, gives them this Narrative of the Emperors and his own deportment in this Tragical transaction. Ad oppidum Canusii in quo morati fuimus, cum paucis (Henricus) advenit; ibique per triduum ante portum Castri, deposito omni regali cultu, miserabiliter, utpote discalceatus, & laneis indutus persistens; non prius quam multo fletu Apostolicae miserationis auxilium & consolationem implorare destitit; quam omnes qui ibi ade∣rant, & ad quos rumor ille pervenit, ad tantam pietatem, & compassionis miseri∣cordiam movit, ut pro eo multis precibus & lachrymis intercedentes, omnes qui∣dem insolitam nostrae mentis duritiam mirarentur; nonnulli vero in nobis, non Apostolicae severitatis gravitatem, sed quasi tyranni∣cae feritatis crudelitatem esse clamarent.

Sigebertus, Mat. Paris An. 1077. Vincentius Bel∣luac. Speculum Histor. l. 25. c. 55. falsa): qualem scilicet pacem Iudas fimulavit, non qualem Christus reliquit. Aderat enim legatio hostium suorum, quaerentium omnibus modis interrumpere initum hoc reconciliationis pactum, qui∣bus Papa rescripsit talibus verbis, Ne solliciti (inquiens) sitis, quoniam culpabilio∣rem eum reddo vobis. Certe culpabiliorem facere aliquem, praecipue autem Regem, quem praecepit Petrus Apostolus honorificare, Hoc non est Oves Christi pascere: Ecce autem propria sunt Regia quaedam ornamenta, Corona et purpura atque alia Regni insignia (whichAnnal. Boio∣rum, l. 5. p: 457, 458 Johannes A∣ventinus largely insists on) a quibus Regem abstinere ad arbitrii sui tempus decer∣nit Papa; hujus scilicet intentionis gratia; ut sic, aut contemptibilior esset ipsius Regis in regno persona, donec rehaberetur regnum, quod jam parabatur in electio∣ne alterius, dum fuerat ipse legitimus Rex in Italia: aut si non permissus a se re∣galia resumeret ornamenta, certiorem perinde haberet circa eum caussam excommu∣nicationis: quod videtur non esse officium pietatis, nec signum con∣cordiae et unitatis. How ill the Italians resented, and what censure they passed on the Pope and Emperor for these Antichristian unparallel'd Proceedings,Historia Ann: 1077 See Cen∣tur: Magd: 11. c: 9. col. 431 Usserius De Christianarum Ecclesiasram succestione & statu, c. 5. p. 133, 134. Lambertus Schafnabergensis thus relates at large. Italiae Proceres eare cognita ad∣modum Regi indignabantur. Exclamabant, se Hildebrandi excommunicationem ni∣hili aestimare, quam ipsum omnes Italiae Episcopi justis ex causis
jampridem excommunicassent, qui Sedem Apostolicam per Simonia∣cam haresm occupasset, adulteriis, aliisque capitalibus criminibus polluisset, Regem secus ac deceat, crimen{que} gloriae suae intulisse nunquam abo∣lendum, quod homini haeretico et probris omnibus infamato, majesta∣tem regiam summiserit: et quem justitiae patronum, legum{que} Eccles, vindicem sibi parassent, is foedissima subjectione sua, fidem plane Ca∣tholicam, authoritatem Ecclesiae, dignitatem Republicae prodiderit. Se in ultionem ejus omnes quas potuerint Papae injurias irro∣gasse; & nunc, quod dictu quoque turpe sit, se in mediis perturbationum fluctibus relictis, ipsum sibi consuluisse; et cum hoste publico privata necessitudine in gra∣tiam redisse. Haec potissimum Principes Italiae jactando, et passim per populum serendo, ingens Regi odium brevi conflaverant. Adulta postremo seditione, una omnium voluntas, una sententia erat, ut ab∣dicato patre, qui ultro regni fascibus indignum se effecisset; filium ejus, licet impubem adhuc, et regni negotiis immaturum, Regem sibi facerent: et cum eo Romam profecti Papam alium eligerent; per quem & ipse protinus Imp. consecraretur, et omnia Papae hujus Apostatici gesta cassa∣rentur. Perlato ad Regem tam molestae conspirationis motu, misit propere quicquid apud se Principum erat, ut quacunque ratione, quaqua possent industria ef∣feratae multitudinis animos mitigarent: ne moleste acciperent, aut in contumelium su∣am factam reputaren, quod extrema necessitate compulsus communis commodi ratione fecisset: nec Teutonicis Principibus, qui sibi per ca∣lumniam regnum eripere dedita opera machinantur, nec Romano Pontifici, qui ad evertendum statum sanctae Ecclesiae spirituali gladio circum∣quaque fulguraret; aliter satisfieri potuisse, quam ut ante statutum diem excommunicatione absolveretur. Nunc se omnibus angustiis quibus vias ejus con∣clusissent inimici, liberatum, omnem deinceps curam industriamque ad vindicandas suas et illorum injurias translaturum. Chron. Scla∣voum, l. 1. c. 28. Hermoldus records; that Henry after this sentence, accepit in mandatis, from this Pope, ut anno integro Roma non discederet, equum non ascenderet, sed in ve∣ste humili circumiret limina Ecclesiarum, or bus & jejuniis, reddens dignum poenitentiae fructum; Quod Rex humiliter adimplere sategit. Videntes ergo Car∣dinales, & in quid de Curia sunt, quia prae timore sedis Apostolicae contre∣miscunt potestates, et curvantur ii, qui portant orbem; suggerunt Apostolico, ut transferat regnum ad alium virum: dicentes; indignum esse, ut talis regnet, qui de publicis convictus est facinoribus. Percunctanti ergo A∣postolico, Quisnam in Alemannia dignus esset tanto culmine? Designatus est Dux Suevorum Rudolphus, quod scilicet fuerit vir bonus, amator pacis, & circa cultum Sa∣cerdotii & Ecclesiarum optima affectus.

A quibus etiam deductus Moguntiam, 12. Kalend. Aprilis, a Segifrido Episcopo in Regem ungitur. Ubi eodem die pessimo auspicio, seditione facta, multa turba vulgi caesa est ab ejus militibus, unde vulgus accensum in ipsos exarsit, magnisque ictibus multos obtrun∣cans;
caeteros ad curiam palam fugavit, ipsasque regias aedes incendere voluit; nisi quod Episcopus Sigefridus pro veloci decessione Rudolphi obsidem se interposuit. Ita Rudolphus, & cuncti ei qui cum eo venerant, ejecti sunt, ipse quoque Sigefridus E∣piscopus magnis blasphemiis eliminatus, Moguntiam non intravit amplius. Whiles these things were thus acted in Germany by the Popes treachery, Henricus consiste∣bat apud Romam Papae mandatis obsecundans, ignarusque malorum quae adversus ip∣sum agebantur; asChronicon Slavorum, l. 1. c. 28, 29.

Hermoldus informs us: Surrexit ergo quidam Strateburgen∣sis Episcopus, amicissimus Regi Henrico, & velociter veniens Romam, diu quaesitum regem, invenit inter memorias martyrum diversantem: De cujus adventu Rex lae∣tus effectus, caepit percunctari de statu regni, aut si omnia in pace consisterent? Cui ille intimavit, Novum Principem electum, factuque opus esse, ut quantocyus Teu∣tonicam terram reviseret, ad confortandos amicorum animos, & conatus hostium reprmendos. Cumque Rex praetenderet, nequaquam sibi sine licentia sedis Apo∣stolicae obeundum: The respondit; Noveris certe, omne hoc conspirationis ma∣lum de parte Roman perfidiae manasse. Imo si captionem evadere voles, de urbe tibi clanculo exeundum est. Egressus ergo noctu Rex exiit Italiam, forma∣usque pro tempore rebus in Longobardis, venit in Teutonicam terram.

Historia de vta Hiltebran∣di Pontificis Romani. Set forth by Rein∣rus Reineccius Steinhemius, printed Franco∣, 1581. Benno Cardinalis, living under this Pope, and present at these transactions, informs us of the names of many great Cardinals and others of note, who condemned his pro∣ceedings against the Emperor as Tyrannical, Unchristian, Heretical; and thereupon, qui Hiltebrandum reliquerunt, cujus intolerabiles et gravissimos errores pub∣lice detestati, nunquam ad eum reversi sunt: Diversae etiam scholae Romanae Ecclesiae ab ejus communione recesserunt. Leo tunc temporis Archipresbyter Cardinalium, & Benno, & Ugobaldus, & Johannes Cardinalis, & Petrus Cancellarius & Cardinalis, ordi∣nati ante tempora Hiltebrandi: Natro, Innocentius, Leo, hi tres ab eo consecrati, dese∣ruerunt eum errores ejus execrati: similiter Theodinus Archidiaconus, quem ipse constituit Archidiaconum, & alii Cardinales Diaconi: Johannes, modo Archidiaconus, & Crescentius, Johannes primicerius scholae cantorum, cum omnibus suis: Petrus oblationarius cum omnibus suis, excepto uno Poppo; Prior scholae regionariae cum omnibus suis Subdiaconis: Archiacolythus, & Subpulmentarius cum suis: Centius, Judicum primicerius cum aliis Judicibus, & cuncti Milites signa banna gestantes, Prior scriniariorum, cum plerisque suis: Ipsi etiam Episcopi cum jam vellent eum deserere, (as well as all those forementioned) Hiltebrandus convocatis ad se Laicis, eis consilium suum aperuit, & quod Episcopos a Colloquio Cardinalium vellet sepa∣rare, indicavit.See Abbas Vspergensis Chron. p. 223, 224. Centur. Magd. 11. c. 8. Barnes and Ba∣laeus in Greg. 7. Sigonius de Regno Italiae, l 9. Post haec ipsos Episcopos convocavit, & turbis Laicorum stipatus, Sacramentum ab ipsis Episcopis cum terrore et minis exegit et ex∣torsit, in manu sua jurare coegit, ne unquam ab eo dissentirent, nunquam Regis causam defenderent, nunquam superordinato sibi Papae faverent, vel obedirent. Quo facto eos per Principem Salernitanum in Campaniam misit: & sic eos a consor∣tio Cardinalium & a Romana Urbe separavit. Nec solum Episcopos, sed etiam Urbis Presbyteros & inferioris ordinis Clericos, insuper & Laicos juramentis alligavit, ne ulla ratione, ullo tempore, condescenderent in causa Regis. These Cardinals and others forecited, who condemned, renounced communion with this Pope, charged him with these practices: Quod ejectis à consilio & à custodia ejus Cardinalibus, vita ejus & fides & Doctrina sine testibus fuit; cum sacri Canones praecipi∣at, ut in omni loco tres Cardinales Presbyteri, & duo Diaconi Papam non deserant, propter testimonium Ecclesiasticum, & propter stylum veritatis. Scripturas sacras violenter intorsit in adjutorium falsitatis: quod genus Idololatriae quantum sit, late patet in Scripturae sacrae campis spaciosis. Praeter voluntatem et consilium Cardinalium, extra ordinem judicandi sacris Canoni∣bus determinatum, Imperatorem in nulla Synodo Canonice accu∣satum, praecipitanter excommunicavit; in qua excommunicatione nul∣lus Cardinalium subscripsit. He further observes this signal divine Judgement: Balaeus de Rom. Pontif. Actis, l. 5. p. 218. in Greg. 7. Ortuin. Grat. Fasciculus, fol. 39, 40. Usseri∣us de Christia∣narum Ecclesi∣arum successio∣ne & statu, c. 5. p. 130. Money Hist. Papatus, p. 256. record it likewise. Ʋt primum ad excommunicandum Caesarem de sede surrexit, sedes ipsa noviter lignis for∣tissimis composita, subito, Dei nutu, terribiliter scissa est in plures partes: Ʋt manifeste daretur intelligi, quanta sessor illa tam periculosa excommunica∣tione et praesumptione, quamque terribilia schismata seminaret con∣tra Ecclesiam Christi, contra sedem Beati Petri, quam crudeliter dissiparet Cathedram Christi, conculcando leges Ecclesiae, impe∣rando cum potentia et austeritate. In descriptione ejusdem excommunicationis, ea interseruit in quibus manifeste a
side Catholica erravit, cum injuste excommunicatum Imperatorem, & Episcopos com∣municantes es, excepti ab excommunicatione tertio gradu communicantes eis, & unitatem Ecclesiae scindens, quantum in ipso fuit, duas Ecclesias fecit. Idem praesumptor, jejunium indixit Garanalibus, ut Deus ostenderet, quis rectius senti∣ret de co-pore Domini, Romana ne Ecclesia, an Berengarius? per hoc manifeste probatus infidelis, cum in Niceno Concilio scriptam sit, quia dubius in side, infielis est. Et de cor∣pore Domini signum quae sivit, quod petente biato Gregorio ad firmaend mmulieris fidem contigit, quando pnis Christi formam accepit digiti. Et  duos Cardinales Oho∣nem & Cunonem, ad Sanctam Anastatiam, ut cum Suppone, ejusdem Ecclesiae Archi∣presbytero, triduanum ejuium peragerent, & illis tribus diebus, singuli per dies singulos Psal∣terium & missas decantarent, ut supradictum sigrum eis Chrius ostenderet, quod minime contigit. They charged him likewise with this most Atheistical and Treasonable con∣spiracy, to murther the Emperor in the midst of his devotions in St. Maries Church: The same is recorded by Abbas Vper∣gensis, p. 223. Aventinus An∣nal Boiorum, l. 6. Barnes, Ba∣laeus, Centur Magd 11. c. 8. Schafnab en∣sis, and  others. Imperator solitus erat frequenter ire ad orationem, ad Ecclesiam Sanctae Mariae, quae est in Monte Aventino. Hiltebrandus autem cum per exploratores sus omnia cus opera soli∣cite inquieret, locum in quo frequentius Imperator, vel staus, vel prostratus orabat, notari fecit; et quendam promissa pecunia ad hoc induxit, ut supra trabes Ecclesiae occulte lapides magnos collocaret, et ita aptaret, ut de alto super caput orantis Imperatoris demitte∣ret, et ipsum conterreret. Quod minister tanti sceleris cum festinares implre, & la∣pidem magni ponderis super trabes aptare vellet, lapis pondere suo eum traxit, & fracta sub trabibus tabula, & lapis & ille miser homo, Dei judicio in pavimentum Ecclesiae cecidit, & eodem lapide contritus penitus est: (a just divine retaliation.) Hujus rei gestrae ordi∣nem postquam Romani cognoveruxt, pedem illius miseri fne ligaverunt, & triduo per plateas Urbis ad exemplum trahi fecerunt. Imperator autem solita clementia jussie cum sepeliri. Johannes Portuensis Episcopus, qui intimus fuerat, & a secretis Hiltebrandi, ascen∣dit in ambonem brati Petri, & inter multa, audiente Clero & populo, ait: Tale quid fecit Hiltebrandus et nos, unde deberemus vivi incendi: significans de Sacramento corporis Domini, quod Hiltebrandus responsa di∣vina quaereus contra Imperatorem, (when he received no answer from this dumb Hostia, and breaden God) fertur injecisse igni, contradicentibus Cardinalibus, qui assistebant ei. (O horrid Impiery!) In Pascha Domini feria secunda cum ad Ecclesiam Sancti Peti ad missam Clerus & populus convenisset, post Evangelium in ambonem ascendit, sicut erat indutus Pontificalibus indumentis. Et in praesentia Episcoporum & Cardinalium in frequentia Cleri, & Seatus populi Romani, publice clamavit inter multa suae divinationis verba,See Mathae Parisiensis, An. 1080. Abbas Vpergensis, Johan. Aventi∣nus Annalium Boiorum, l. 5. Centur. Magd. 11 c. 8. Balaeus, Barnes, Mor∣ney, and others forecited. Regem Henricum usque ad proximum Sancti Petri festum sine dubio moriturum; aut a Regno penitus dejiciendum, in tantum, ut ulterius non posset con∣gregare quam ser milites. Prae licavit etiam Episcopis & Cardinalibus, & omnibus qui aderant de Ambone clamans, nullo modo habete me pro Papa ulterius, sed ab Altari me avellite, si usque ad praedictum festum, Prophetia haec effectum non habuerit. (To make good these his prophecies by his designed Treasons, of whose successe he was thus confident,) Eisdem diebus paravit Im∣peratorem perdere per occultos proditores; Deus autem eum custo∣divit. Et eodem tempore fuerunt nonnulli qui existimaverut, ipsum Hiltebrandum conscium extitisse, et ordinatorem proditionis: quia eisdem diebus, paulo ante proditionem, de morte Regis falso prophetate praesumpsit. Quod verbum vehementer percussit corda multorum. Et palam factum est, Hiltebran∣dum voce propria in Conventu Ecclesiae esse damnatum, qui (ut dictum est) judicaverat, se nullo modo esse Papam, neque pro Papa ulterius ha∣bendum, sed proditorem et mendacem esse credendum; nisi usque ad proximum festum Sancti Petri, Imperator moreretur, aut omni ho∣nore spoliaretur, adeo ut ultra sex milites congregare non posset: et divino nutu actum est, ut a seipso quoque damnaretur haereticus. Sic enim ait Apostolicus; Dominus ipse inquit, Propheta qui arrogantia depravatus, vo∣luerit loqui in nomine meo quae ego non praecepi, ut diceret, aut ex nomine aliorum
Deorum, interficietur Quod si tibi tacita cogitatione responderis: Quomodo possum intelligere verbum, quod Dominus non ost eloquutus? Hoc habetis signum, quod in nomi∣ne opheta praedixerit, & non evenerit, hoc Dominus non est locutus, sed per tumorem animi sui Propheta confinxit, & idcirco non timebis eum. Tempore autem transacto, quod Hiltebrandus in divinatione sua praefixit, Rege verò neque mortuo, neque militibus suis imminuto, timens se suis verbis deprehensum, & ore pro∣prio condemnatum, ad callia argumenta se convertit, persuadens vulgo indocto, non de corpore, sed de anima Regis se propheass, quasi anima Regis milites omnes praeter sex  esset. Et his verbis vulgus indoctum delusit. Con∣tra hujusmodi Prophetas beatus Gregorius super : Inter Prophetas ve∣rs &  ista  distantia, quia Propheta ver quid aliquando per suum spiritum dicunt, citius corrigunt: Prophetae autem falsi, & falsa denunciant, & alieni a cto spiritu in sua faltate perdurant. (Moreover to evidence his Papal Justice) Tes homines (suspected to favour the Emperors party) non convictos, non con∣fessos osque secularibus judicibus Hiltebrandus morti judicavit, & eos in patibulis jux∣ta Ecclesiam Sancti Petri, in loco qui dicitur Palatiolum, interfici suspensos coegit, sine dilatione sine discussione contra leges, quae praecipiunt etiam manifestos reos infra spacium &  riginta dierum non interfici. Quae etiam apud Paganos vigent & ser∣vantur, sicut docet authoritas B. Ambrosu, & Pass Sanctorum Marcelliani & Marci. See  Greg. 7. Cent. Magd. . c. 8. Sabel∣licus.

Cintium  praefecti Stepham, prius fidelem suum, in carcerem misit, & in vase un∣dique aculets vestito, mille & mille mortibus cruciavit. Qui postquam evasit, (out of loyalty to the Emperor) ipsum Hiltebrandum coepit. De cujus captione antequam evaderet, omnibus, qui captionis illius cooperatores fuerant, hoc debitum publice remisit, quod postea infideliter vindicavit, Cintium cui omnia remiserat, persequi coepit, & novem de hominibus Cintii in patibulis suspendio interfecit, ante portas Sancti Petri, &c. Multa quidem aliafecit Hiltebrandus, in quem clamat sanguis Ecclesiae gla∣dio linguae ejus miserabili proditione effusus, propter quae, a communione ejus justissime Ecclesia recessit, sicut fecerunt majores nostri temporibus Apostatarum Liberii & Anastasii. Hiltebrandus autem non solum Ecclesiae perturbavit pacem, sed etiam Ecclesiasticam scidit unitaetem, & unicae fidei vestem inconsutilem: dum Caesarem et Episcopos communicantes Caesari, absque judiciario ordine excommunicabat, et tertio gradu communicantes eis, ab excommunicatione nova pietate excipiebat; quos hujusmodi artibus, & Regi subducere, & sibi allicere festinabat. Dicant nunc Hiltebrandi discipuli, quibus commentis, quibus coloribus, deaurare possint, quod ipse Hiltebrandus in Synodo generali haeretica praedicavit, praedicando excommu∣nicatis communicare consensit; praedicata scripsit, praedicatione & scriptis alteram Catho∣licam, alteram excommunicatorum Ecclesiam faciens, unitatem scidit, et scripta per or∣bem terrarum disseminavit: praedicando, scribendo, scripta dissemi∣nando, seipsum haereticum manifestavit, et ore proprio, et confessione haereseos non extorta, divino urgente judicio condemnavit, dum vulgus erroneum Sanctum existimaret, & Apostolis exaequaret spiritum tanti erroris, cum etiam prudentio∣res ejus laqueis caperentur, & inducerentur in tentationem, si fieri posset, etiam electi. Mentimur, nisi tresdecim Cardinales sapientiores et religiosiores, ipse Archidiaconus,Nota. et ipse Primicerius, et multi alii Lateranensium Clericorum, quorum judicio ex privilegio sanctae sedis totus subjacet mundus, Apostasiam ejus intolerabilem perpendentes, ab ejus com∣munione recesserunt. Dicant oramus, Hiltebrandi discipuli, qua praesumptione Magister eorum unitatem Ec∣clesiae in duas vel plures partes divisit? Si enim Caesarem injuste et absque ju∣diciario ordine damnavit, seipsum potius ab Ecclesia separavit. Si vero juste excommunicationis gladium in Caesarem, vel Episcopos communicantes Cae∣sari exeruit, quare communicantes ipsis Episcopis tertio gradu per Scripturam exci∣piendo absolvit. Gloriosus autem Hiltebrandus, & pedissequus ejusCardinal O∣tho, afterwards Pope. Turbanus Hil∣tebrandi pedis∣sequus. Turbanus, nova potestate solventes decreta Chalcedonensis Concilii, non solum verbis, sed & scriptis publicis consense∣runt extra Ecclesiam communicare, & baptizare: quam coesi essent, quam haeretici scrip∣tis propriis deprehensi. Prob nefas! ii praesumpserunt de Ecclesia judica∣re,
quiErgo Popes & Cardinals may erre. nusquam reperiuntur non errasse; quibus etiam ipsa veritas reputatux in mendacium, quam solo fallendi studio verbis et scriptis suis, ne venena erroris eorum perciperentur, quasi mel veneficorum more admiscuerunt. Mendacium enim est, ut beatus Augustinus ait, omnis enuncia∣tio prolata intentione fallendi. Sileant Hypocritae, sicut ait beatus Petrus piratis similes, beati Petri nomen igne malitiae sub nomine Catholi∣co, sub obtentu justitiae artificiose supposito, destruentes, et fere de∣mergentes. Obstupescant Pseudo-prophetae ad vocem Petri, in facie humani, in cauda scorpiones, lupi sub ovina pelle latentes, corpora trucidantes in oris gladio, et animas pariter devorantes, Benno his censure of Pope Hildebrands & his Successors Roman Religi∣on. QUORUM RELIGIO NIHIL ALIUD REDOLET QUAM PRODITIONEM ET AVARITIAM, penetrantes domos viduarum cap∣tivas duxerunt mulierculas oneratas peccatis, sub occasione impacati temporis attendentes spiritibus erroris & Doctrinis Daemonum, quas accepit Hiltebrandus Magister eorum, à Magistris suis, à Theophylacto, qui cognominatus est Benedictus Papa IX. à Lau∣rentio Malasitano Archiepiscopo, à Johanne Archipresbytero S. Johannis, de porta Latina, qui postea cognominatus est Sextus Gregorius Papa. (Whose Magical Arts, Practices, Necromancies, familiarity with, and Sacrifices to the Devil himself, he there at large relates) Adding, Hiltebrandus a suis Militibus sine assensu Cleri & populi est intro∣nizatus; qualiter vixerit, qualiter a se Cardinales, qui testes vitae & dorinae ejus esse debuerunt, removerit, quam miserabiliter vexaverit, quantis haeresibus mundum corruperit, quanta perjuria quam immensas perditiones consecraverat, vix a multis describi potest: clamat tamen altius sanguis Christianorum o auctore et incentore miserabiliter effusus. So Benno Cardinalis. Upon all which accounts he and others then renounced all Communion with him. An. 1079. Henry & Rudolphus fought another battel at Fladeheim, where Rudolphus with his Saxons and other forces were put to flight: notwithstanding the Popes be∣nediction, and Henries with all his adherents excommunications;Anonymus Hist. de vita Henrici 4.

Sed nulli mirum sit Virum in rebus bellicis exercitatum & strenum tunc fugisse; quia saepe justior & victrix causa, fortes in metum mittit et in fugam. Henricus postea Saxoniam cum ex∣ercitu saepius ingressus, aut victor, aut aequa manu recessit. Caesar fusis hostibus, (Anno 1080.) Osnoburgensem, Virdunensemque Episcopos Romam cum mandatis pro∣ficisci jubet, postulatque a Pontif. Maximo Ut siquidem secum syncerè in gratiam re∣dierit, tyrannum immanissimum, perfidum, parricidam (qui affinitatis vinculo fidei{que} reli∣gione violata, bellum plusquam civile exercitaret, pacem interturbarit) pro Republica, devoveat. Rudolphus quoque Romani Episcopi opem, cujus auspicio regnare jussus sit, supplex implorat, petitque, ut Pontifex Maximus communis generis humani parens, faedissimum sacrilegum, incestuosum, sacerdotum contemptorem, cujus Deus venter, atque ea quae sub ventre sunt, sacro ense jugulet. Gregorius hujus postulatis annuit, Hainricum quod contra atque pollicitus fuerat, insignia Imperii usurparit, rursus execratur: Proceres, populum, sacratos, prophanos Sacramento sol∣vit, eos qui Caesari fidem frangant, Principi suo rebellent, Rudol∣pho adhaereant, ab inferis emancipat, coeloque locat; hisce incendia, caedes et hujusmodi scelera, quae bello designari solent, indulget: a∣liis omnibus, qui Caesari fidem servent, ab eo deficere, armis se miscere recusant, diras inferiasque dicit. Regem malum ob crimi∣ua a se devotum, proinde jam non Regem, neque illi parendum esse docebat, quin obsequium praestare Deo, pietasque esse occidere eos qui Hainrico fidem servarent, asseverabar. Sacerdotibus quoque con∣nubiis interdicit, vetat populum sacrificiis eorum interesse, aut illos pro Sacerdotibus ducere. Gratissima haec fuere Scortatoribus, quibus pro una uxore sexcentas muli∣erculas inire licet. Sed istaec omnia, plerisque Episcopis, aliis eruditis, simplicibus a∣pertis atque bonis, praeter conjuratos, qui suae causae serviebant, novum dogma, pestifera haeresis, quae unquam Christianum conturbasset regnum, visa est.Aventinus Annalium Boi∣orum, l. 5. p 460 Abbas Usper∣gensis, Chron: Anno 1080. p. 224.

The recited Speech, and manner of Rudolphus his death, much disparaging Pope Hil∣brands Antichristian cause, proceedings, and blasting his & his Prelates reputations; they thereupon forged many fabulous Legends of Gods signal judgements upon some Bishops opposing Hildebrand, and adhering to the Emperor, to seduce the people, and vanquish those by Lyes and Counterfeit false miracles, whom they could not overcome by arguments or armes.Aventinus Annal: Boiorum l. 5. p. 469, 470 Cent.

As for Hilde∣brand himself, thus branded then by all good, just, ingenuous, openhearted, honest men, for the beginner, erecter of Antichrists Empire, during his life; a Priest of Saxony in that age by special revelation gave the world this account what became of him, and the two usurping Kings set up by him against the Emperor Henry, after their deaths:Aventinus An∣nal. Boiorum, l. 5 p. 470. Sacerdos expiranti similis triduo in Saxonia decubuit; is uti ad se rediit, apud inferos Hildebrandum, Rudolphum, Hermannum tyrannos, aeternis mactari suppliciis, revelavit; (which Rudolphus dreaded at his death) where I shall leave them at present. What unchristian effects, bloody civil wars, insurrections were occasioned throughout Christendom by this Emperors dethroning, and setting up Rudolphus in his stead, are thus recorded by one living in, or near that age;Apologet. de Vnitate Eccles. p. 286. Edit. M. Frcheri: See, Aventinus Annal. Boio∣rum, l. 5. p. 455. Hac divisione facta, surrexit Rex adversus Regem, gens adversus gentem, Episcopus contra E∣piscopum, populus contra populum. Exinde vero quantae caedes factae sint hominum, quantae destructiones Ecclesiarum, quanta etiam rerum confusio exinde facta sit in omni Ecclesia, indigere videtur Tragoedia magis, quam historia. Magno se ju∣dice quis tuetur, dum uterque Rex juste arma se induisse arbitratur. Henricus sci∣licet, quod natus & nutritus in regno successit progenitoribus suis in regnum ex Dei ordinatione, ac proinde accepisse, juxta doctrinam Apostoli vindicem gladium in im∣pios atque justos vel Ecclesiae vel Reipublicae. Rudolphus autem, quod obediens, esse deberet Pontifici sedis Apostolicae, qui per Episcopos partis suae praedicasset, eum non teneri obnoxium perjurii vel perfidiae, si contra eum arma tulisset, qui, utpote excommunicatus, Rex jam esse non posset: quum hoc sit, inquiunt, fidei ac fidelium in Ecclesia, occidere, scili∣cet, et persequi eos quicunque communicantes vel faventes excom∣municato Regi Henrico, noluerint declinare post partium suarum studia. Nova et inaudita est praedicatio hujusmodi, quoniam Eccle∣sia non habet sibi concessum gladium, nisi spiritus, quod est ver∣bum Dei. Which warrants no such Hildebrandian Heresie as they preached. The lawfulnesse and unlawfulnesse of the Popes excommunicating and deposing the Emperor, was as hotly disputed in Rome by the Cardinals, and in Synods, Pulpits, Schools by Bishops and Scholars, as it was by the Princes and Soldiers in the field.

Annal Boio∣rum, l 5 p. 448, 449. Aventinus relates, that Gerochus (quo nemo acrius scriptis libris Hildebrandum tutatus est) tandem suae partis pertinaciam, ne dicam Tyrannidem, hisce verbis, concta veritate notat; Romani (inquit) sibi divinum usurpant honorem, ratio∣nem actorum reddere nolunt, nec sibi dici aequo animo ferunt, Cur ita agis? Illud Sacyricum inculcant, Sic volo, sic jubeo, stat pro ratione Voluntas. He then subjoyns, that as the Popes till then were confirmed by the Emperors: so Hactenus, sanctissimi Patres, (quemadmodum Christus Dominus & Deus noster, Co∣mites, & Legati ejus fecerunt, & alios docuerunt) Caesares in terris a Deo secundos, ante omnes mortales primos, a supremo numine datos, divinitus constitutos, ab im∣mortali Deo electos, & (ut illi vocant) Coronatos, venerabantur; Dominos{que} suos voca∣re solebant. Eisdem tributum, censum non denegabant; pro eorum salute quotidie comprecabantur. Imperata detrectantes, tanquam coelesti provinciae resistentes, vide∣ri contra pietatem Christianam fecisse decernebant. Grande nomen esse Imperato∣ris, a Deoque tradi praedicabant; Reipub. turbellis, nedum armis, ut Milites Christi se non immiscebant, paupertate & modestia cum caeteris Christians decertabant; quo quisque submissius se gereret, hoc majorem esse sentiebant. Ensem ancipitem, gladi∣um duplicem, Christianae Civitati datum, ad servandum vivificandumque, non occi∣dendum esse putabant; eundemque spiritualem appellabant, qui est Sermo Dei, vita & lux hominum, & mortuos ad vitam revocat; ex hominibus Deos, ex mortalibus a ternos facit: tantum abfuit ut  vel regum quempiam, vel impium, vel Arrianum regno pellere, eidem sacrificiis interdicere, populum Sacramento solvere tentarent, atque regna evertere, sanguine humano se polluere, pro principatu cum Christianis decertare, sibi permittant. Hildebrand being the first who asserted the contrary. Chronicn. Hsaug: anno 1106. J. Trithemius writes thus of this Emperor Henries deposition by this Pope; Ipse primus est inter omnes Imperatores per Papam depositus, Scho∣lastici certant, & adhuc sub judice lis est; Vtrum Papa Imperatorem possit deponere? Quam quaestionem, cum ad nos non pertineat, indiscussam relinqua∣mus. Chronicorum lib. 6. cap. 35. lib. 7. in Pro∣logo, p. 139 Otto Frisingensis Episcopus, writing of the change and diminution of the Roman Empire, by this Emperors excommunication & deposition by Hildebrand, hath this memorable observation. Lego & relego Romanorum Regum & Pontificum ge∣sta, & nusquam invenio aliquem eorum ante hunc Henricum a Romano Pontif. excommunicatum, vel regno privatum, &c. Sic & regnorum mutationes & ad ulti∣mū imminutiones, quis fructus sequatur, quia non sine gravi scandalo dicere possumus, Deo apud quem nihil inutiliter effuere potest, relinquamus. Non desunt tamen qui dicant, Deum ad hoc Regnum imminui voluisse, ut Ecclesiam exal∣taret: Regni quippe viribus ac beneficentia Regum, exaltatam, et ditatam, nemo ambigit Ecclesiam; constatque non prius eam in tan∣tum regnum humiliare potuisse, quam ipso ob amorem sacerdotii eviscerato, ac viribus erhausto, non ejus tantum, id est spirituali, sed suo proprio materiali scilicet gladio percussum, destruetur: quod judicare, vel discutere, supra nostras vires est. Videntur tamen culpandi Sacerdotes per omnia, qui Regnum suo gladio, quem ipsi ex Regum habent gratia, ferire conantur, nisi forte David imitari cogi∣tent, qui Philistheum primo virtute Dei stravit, postmodum proprio gladio jugu∣lavit. Verum quia regno decrescente, Ecclesia (ut dixi) bravium aeternae pa∣triae, ac post vitae praesentis laborem, requiem adeptura, in praesenti quoque in magnum montem crescens, in magna authoritate stare coepit, ea quae sequuntur, praesertim cum ad nostra tempora recentemque memoriam ven∣tum sit, tam defectu rerum temporalium, quam profectu spiritualium, mundi con∣temptum prodentia, in hoc opere dicenda restant. Nemo autem propter haec verba nos Christianum Imperium ab Ecclesia seperare putet, cum duae personae in Ec∣clesia Dei, Sacerdotalis & Regales esse noscuntur: memineritque nos supra dixisse a tempore Theodosii senioris, usque ad tempus nostrum, non jam de duabus civitati∣bus, imo de una pene, id est Ecclesia, sed permixta, historiam texuisse. Quod tem∣peramentum propter Haereticos vel excommunicatos ex regibus, posuimus. Alios enim Christiana fide, etsi opera quae credant non sequuntur, in Ecclesia secundum praesentem statum computandos esse, nemo qui sagenam Domini malos & bonos continere scit, dubitat. Non enim discerni possunt in praesenti, Ecclesia tantum quae manifesta sunt judicante. Deo solo qui novit, qui sint ejus, cujus ventilabrum in
manu ejus, merita singulorum pensante. Porro Ecclesiam ecclesiasticas personas, id est Sacerdotes Christi, eorumque sectatores, tam ex usu locutionis, quam con∣sideratione potioris partis diximus; non ignorantes, quod & ipsi si reprobam vitam duxerint, ad Civitatem Dei in aeternum non pertinebunt. In the cloze of his Sixt Book upon this unpresidented excommunication and deposition of this Emperor by Hil∣debrand, and its sad effects, he thus descants;Otto risin∣gensis Chron. l. 6. c. 35, 36 Hic quod supra distuli, solvendum puto, quod Romanum Imperium, ferro inDan. 2. 40, 41, 42. Daniele comparatum, pedes ex parte ferre∣os, ex parte fictiles habuit, donec a lapide praeciso de monte sine manibus, excisum subrueretur, Quid enim aliud (sine melioris sententiae praejudicio) lapidem sine mani∣bus excisum, quam ecclesiam capitis sui corpus, sine carnali commixtione ex Spi∣ritu sancto conceptum, & Virgine natum, ipsam quoque sine humana operatione, & ex Spiritu & aqua regeneratam dixerim, &c. Hoc nimirum regnum circa finem suum, quem pedes significant, ferreum propter Martem, fictile propter conditionem, in ea parte quae infirmior fuit, percussit: dum Regem Orbis, non tanquam Orbis dominum vereri, sed tanquam de  per humanam conditionem factum , gladio anathematis ferire decuit. Ipsa vero quae antea parva fuit & hu∣milis, in quantum Montem excreverit (under Hildebrand) ab omnibus jam videri potest. Quanta autem mala, quae bella, bellorumque discrimina inde subsecu∣ta sunt, quoties misera Roma obsessa, capta, vastata, Quod Papa super Papam, sicut Rex super Regem positus fuerit, taedet memorare. Denique tot mala, tot schismata, tot tam animarum quam corporum pericula, hujus tempestatis turbo involvit, ut solus ex persecutionis immanitate, ac temporis diuturnitate, ad humanae miseriae infelicitatem suf∣ficer comprobandam. Unde a quodam Ecclesiastico scriptore densissimis Egypti tenebris comparatur. Praedictus enim Pontifex Gregorius a Rege urbe pellitur, Gi∣bertus{que} Rvennatensis Episcopus in locum ejus subrruditur. Porro Gregorius Salerni moriens, appropinquante vocationis suae tempore, dixisse fertur: Dilexi justitiam & odi iniquitatem, proprea maior in exilio. Quia ergo in Principe suo regnum ab Ecclesia prcisum graviter percussum fuit. ecclesia quo{que} tanto pastore, qui inter omnes sacerdotes & Romanos Pontifices praecipui Zeli, ac authoritatis erat, orbata, dolorem non modicum habuit. Tanta mutatione, tanquam a perfectione ad de∣fectum vergente tempore, sexto Operi finem imponamus ut ad septenarium, requi∣em{que} animarum, quae misriam praesentis vitae subsequitur, Deo ductore properemus.

Universa in∣cendus, caede complet. Hildebrandus fretus opibus Machtyldae, & Ruperti Vischardi Nordmanni, portas urbis clausit, fortiter urbem tutatus est, saepius eruptionem fecit.

Tandem post annos duos quarto Nonas Junii anno ab Orbe Vindicata Millesimo Octogesimo tertio, urbs capta est: Romani cum supplices adsunt, auro aegre pacem impetrant, perfidi∣am omnem in Hildebrandum transferunt, obsides viginti dant nobilissimos cujusque liberos, quos Hainricus postulavit. Romani deinde suasu Gregorii, Hainricum adeunt, orant ut diem Colloquio constituat, ubi ipse & Pontifex Senatoresque conveniant, de rebusque Reipublicae summis consilium habeant, bonorum{que} virorum arbitratu pax communiter confirmetur. Non abnuit postulata Caesar, diem huic negotio destinat, &c. In the mean time the Emperor returning from Rome by reason of the plague and new rebellions raised by Hildebrand in Germany Cal. Nov. ut conductum erat, Romam revertitur, maximo{que} honore excipitur. Nuncii ultro citroque commeant; Gregorium & Caesarem in gratiam redigere conantur.

Caesari non fuit consilium vitam, dignitatem, salutem suam atque amicorum, arbi∣trio inimicorum in potestate acerbissimorum hostium credere, se ense suo jugulare, manubrium e manu dimittere: Gregorius tamen simulata pace, fugae
ornatu dissimulato, Salernum ad Nordmannos aufugit, & qui omnes in periculum im∣pulerat, omnes in periculo deserit. Caesar coacto Procerum, Episcoporum , advocata concione populi, more majorum, comitia Pontificaia havet; Hildebrandus necessitae in rationem versa,, Anno 1081. tanquam lupus, fur ac latro, veluti perfidus transfuga, ovium desertor, gregis proditor, chri∣stianae charitatis osor, vir sanguinum, omnium communiter consensu abdicatur.

I shall render you a more particular account of Hildebrands, the Emperors, and this New Pope Clements proceedings against each other, out of Bertoldus Con∣stantiensis, one of Hildebrands faction, living & writing in that ageBertoldus Constantiensis, Presbyter; ad Hermannum Appendix, p. 350 Anno 1080. Gregorius Papa Synodum Romae, mense Martio collegit, ad quam de Tentonicis par∣tibus praedictae sedis Apostolicae Legati, redierunt, & ommimodam Rudolfi obedi∣entiam, & Heinrici inobedientiam, Domino Apostolico renuncaverunt; unde ipse in fine Synodi Heinricum deposuit, ipsumque cum omnibus suis fauto∣ribus anathemizavit, et Rudlophum Apostolica authoritate in Regia dignitate confirmavit. Unde, aemulus ejus congregata multitudine omnium Schismaticorum sive excommunicatorum apud Brixinam legitimum Papam ab∣juravit, & Guibertum Ravennatem quondam Episcopum, sed jam triennio a Papa Gregorio, irrecuperabiliter depositum, & anathemizatum, sibi non in Papam, sed in Haeresiarcham, elegit. Deinde apud Moguntiam conventu facto, eandem ipsam electionem, a quibuscunque potuit confirmari fecit: (by his Imperial Soveraign Ecclesiastical Authority;) He subjoyns, His temporibus Heinricus totam Italiam adeo conturbavit, ut nullus secure ad limina Apostolorum posset ire, qui non prius adjuraret, quod ad Papam Gregorium diversurus non esset. Anno 1081. Heinricus post obitum Regis Rudolphi Veronam in Pascha venit,Anno 1081 & nde ad invadendam Romam,Ibid. p. 30. cum suo non Apostolico, sed Apostata Guiberto, ut pu∣ta Domini Apostolici non semel perjuro & anathemizato; profectus, sed macte re∣versus est. In the mean time (as he relates) the Archbishops, Bishops and German Princes of Hildebrands faction, made and crowned Hermannus for their King, by the Popes instigation. Soon after; Ibidem p. 350 Henricus Anno 1082. In Italiam assumpto Apostata suo Guiberto,Anno 1082 iterum Romam invisurus proficiscitur, adunata multitudine Schismaticorum, ibique ea ae∣state moratus, pene incassum laboravit; nisi quod Milites suos quibusdam castellis, ut facerent guerram Romanis, imposuit, qui eum nec hac vice Romam intrare permi∣serunt. Ignem quoque in domum Sancti Petri per quendam traditorem immittere voluit, sed Dei misericordia protegente, non potuit. Cogitavit enim ut de impro∣viso, portus irrumperet, si Romani derelictis propugnaculis, ad incendium restin∣gendum concurrerent, unde ignem domibus quibusdam Sancto Petro contiguis im∣mitti fecerunt. Sed Dominus Apostolicus huic versutiae obviavit. Nam primum vi∣so incendio, omnes milites Romanos ad propugnacula defendenda transmisit, ipse∣que solus fiducia Sancti Petri fretus, facto signo Crucis contra incendium, ignem progredi ulterius non permisit. Igitur Heinricus capto Venerabili Episcopo de Su∣tria, alliisque nonnullis, suoque Apostata Guiberto in Tiburtina urbe ad infestandos Romanos derelicto, ipse Longobardiam revertitur. Hermannus autem Rex multum de adversitate sedis Apostolice dolens, eamque de manu Heinrici liberare volens, ex∣peditionem in Italiam paravit unde & de Saxonia in Sueviam venit; but was diver∣red. Ibid. p: 351, 352. Anno 1083. An. 1083. Iteram Heinricus cum multitudine Schismaticorum sive Excommu∣nicatorum ante Pentecosten Roman impugnaturus aggreditur: sicque Guibertum Ra∣vennatem, perjurum, depositum, & anathemizatum, apud S. Petrum inthronizavit. non per Ostiensem, & Albanensem & Portuensem Episcopos, qui hoc privilegium ha∣bent, ut & Papam consecrent: sed per Mutinensem & Ariminensem Episcopos: ut∣pote jam multis annis depositos & anathemizatos. Statim ergo juxta sanctum Pe∣trum quendam monticulum, nomine Palatiolum in Castellum, eique milites multos, ut impugnarent Romanos, imposuit, qui eum Transtiberinis urbis regiones, nullo pacto intrare permittebant. Multi tamen jam ex Romanis consenserant, partim
pretio inducti, partim multis promissionibus seducti, omnes autem aequaliter jam triennii impugnatione nimium fatigati. Quid plura? omnes pene Romani, prae∣ter Principem Salernitanum, hoc laudaverunt, ut Papa Gregorius Synodum in medio Novembris colligeret Romae, cujus Synodi statuta de causa Regni, nec Heinrico, nec Romanis, imo nulli penitus liceret praevaricari. Heinricus quoque ituris ad il∣lam Synodum, & redituris, securitatem jurejurando fecit. Unde et Papa omnes re∣ligiosos Episcopos & Abbates ad Synodum literis suis vocavit. Heinricus (after some stay at Ravenna) ad praedictam Synodum profectus est, quo & Legati Teuto∣nicorum principum ire debuerant, sed ab Heinrico in via apud forum Cassii capti, & sedati sunt, circa festum sancti Martini, licet omnibus Synodum illam petentibus se∣curitatem juramento promiserit. Unde & Romani multa contra Heinricum murmu∣rare coeperunt. Erant autem religiosissimi Monachi & Clerici, quos in captivitate fecit cruciari, (for stirring up rebellions against him in Saxony and elsewhere) cum quibus & Ottonem venerandum Ostiensem Episcopum captivatum, videlicet, ad ipsum ab Apostolica sede transmissum. Multi tamen ex Francigenis ad illam Synodum, tam Episcopi vel Abbates pervenerunt. Meliores autem Episcopi & Domino A∣postolico magis necessarii, id est, Hugo Lugdunensis, Anselmus Lucensis, Reginaldus Cumanus, specialiter a Heinrico ad Synodum pervenire, prohibiti sunt: Dominus tamen Papa Synodum tribus diebus solenniter celebravit, & ne Heinricum iterum speci∣aliter anathemizaret, vix a Synodo exoratus, omnes tamen excom∣municavit, quicunque aliquem ad sanctum Petrum, et Papam veni∣entem impedirent, quoquo modo. Sed jam advenit terminus, ad quem Ro∣mani, nesciente Papa, hoc Heinrico se effecturos juraverant, aut Gregorius Papa eum incoronaret, aut alius quem ipsi illo expulso eligerent. Quod juramentum licet in praeterita aestate factum fuerit, omnes tamen intimos Papae usque ad terminum pene atuit. Adveniente ergo termino, Romani Papae de juramento manifestaverunt, dicentes, se hoc jurasse, non ut Papa solenniter regali unctione incoronaret, sed tantum simpliciter, ut ei coronam daret. Annuit ergo Papa eorum votis, ut eos a juramento absolveret, viz. Heinrico; si vellet cum justitia: sin autem, cum maledictione (note it) Coronam daret: Unde Romani mandaverunt, ut veni∣ret ad accipiendam Coronam cum justitia, si vellet: Sin autem, de Ca∣stello Sancti Angeli per virgam sibi demissam a Papa reciperet. Sed Heinrico u∣trumque recusante, alium Legatum illi direxere, qui eos bello defenderet si necesse esset. Se bene attendisse quid juraverint, nec se amplius eo juramento detineri ob∣noxios. Igitur Domino Papae multo firmius, quam pridem, consilio adhaesere. Sed jam septennio totum Romanum Imperium civili bello, nimio schismatis dissidto, labo∣ravit: aliis quidem Domino Apostolico, aliis autem Heinrico faventibus, & ob hoc utrinque totum Regnum praeda, ferro et igne miserabiliter devastan∣tibus, paucissimi Catholici Episcopi ex parte Apostolici remanse∣runt, qui et a propriis sedibus expulsi, suis gregibus providere non permittebantur. Quapropter, omnes pene religiosi, sive Clerici, sive Laici, in a∣liqua Monasteriorum latibula hujusmodi mala declinaverunt: ne videlicet devastati∣onem sanctae Ecclesiae cernerent, cui in nullo adminiculari possent. Satius enim il∣lis videbatur, ut saltem seipsos, delitescendo salvarent, quam pro aliis incassum la∣borando cum eisdem perirent. Ibidem, p. 357 354. Anno 1084. Reginaldus Cumanus Episcopus, Gregorii Papae adjutor studiosissimus migravit ad Dominum, & Sigefridus Moguntiensis Archiepiscopus, Gregorio Papae per multas tribulationes adjutor indefessus, requievit in pace. Heinricus Aquileiensis Patriarcha, non semel Domino Apostolico perjurus & excommunicatus, in corpore & anima moritur. In die Resurrectionis Dominicae Heinricus a heresiarcha suo Ra∣vennate, coronam, non gloriae, sed confusionis accepit; Nam hujusmodi coro∣nator, juxta attestationem sanctorum Patrum, non benedictionem quam perdidit, sed damnationem, quam habuit, suo coronato imposuit. Erat enim ipse Ravennas Ar∣chiepiscopus & omnimodam obedientiam Romano Pontifici juravit, quam & non∣nullo tempore fideliter exequutus est; sed non multo post spreto juramento, singu∣lari contumacia contra Apostolicam sedem erigitur. Unde ab Apostolica sede & ab Episcopis totius Ecclesiae in Romana Synodo post Canonicas inducias irrecupera∣biliter deponitur, & anathemizatur; nec hoc semel, nec in una Synodo, sed in om∣nibus Synodis quotquot jam sexennio Romae celebratae sunt. Hic ergo in perjurio
ita inveteratus, & pro eadem saepius irrevocabiliter depositus & anathemizatus (so∣little did he esteem this Antichristian Popes frequent Anathemaes, or his Synods) sedem Romani Pontif: cui obedientiam juravit,pr. pro manus Anathematiza∣torum, utpote sui stimlium, praeterito anno invasit, legitimo pastore adhuc eidem sede praesidente: nempe Mutinensis & Aretinus Exepiscopi cum reliquis excommuni∣catis eum ordinaverunt. Qui etiamsi Catholici essent & Apostolica sedes Pastorem non haberet, nullum tamen eidem sedi Pontificem ordinare possent. Hujus etiam ordinationis privilegium solis Cardinalibus Episcopis, Ostensi, Albanensi, & Portu∣ensi, a sanctis Patribus est concessum, nec aliquibus aliis conceditur, ipsis hoc adim∣plere valentibus. Sed hi libentius omnia extrema paterentur, quam tam sacrile∣gae ordinationi, tanquam superbissimae praesumptioni miscerentur, quem et ipsi cum Domino Apostolico Synodali judicio canonice damnarunt. Ergo Mutinensis & Are∣tinus cum reliquis haereticis, Ravennatem illum, non in Romanum Patriar∣cham, quod nullo modo potuerunt, sed in damnatissimum haeresiar∣chum promoverunt, ut quanto altius inter ipsos emineret, tanto majoris damnatio∣nis privilegium possideret (writes this Hildebrandian fury) Quapropter & Heinricus ab eodem incoronatus, damnationem ejus haereditasse non dubitatur. Similiter & omnes quicunque aliquid, quod a Domino Papa suscipiendum esset, a praedicto hae∣resiarcha quasi susceptum, usurpaverunt.Chronicon Anno 1084. p. 225. Abbas Uspergensis records, Imperator ipsis (Romanis) petentibus, ut quia Hildebrandus ab ipsis abdicatus, aufugerat, Wigpertum Ravennensem Episcopum, eis Apostolicum praeficeret. xi. Kal. Aprilis feria 6. ante diem Palmarum multis stipatus cum magna gloria intravit, ducens secum praedictum Episcopum. Qui sequente Dominica per multos Episcopos Apostolico no∣mine dicatus, nomenque Clementis accipiens, reverenter est intronizatus. A quo Rex cum Regina Bertha in sancta Dominica Paschae imperiali dignitate sublimatus est.Ibidem Bertholdus thus proceeds, Morabatur autem Heinricus in Lateranensi Palatio cum Ravennate suo, nec a fidelibus Papae per Civitatem ad sanctum Petrum transire permittebatur, sed in ipsa Paschali hebdomada fideles aggreditur, in qua congressio∣ne 40. pene inter mortuos & vulneratos perdidit; nam reliqui fugerunt: ex parte autem domini Papae nec unus cecidit. A Papal pious celebration of Easter by these Martial Popes, even in Rome it self. Pope Gregory being overpowred at Rome by the Emperors forces, therupon hired and sent for Robert Wiscard to assist him. Hereupon Robertus Wiscardus Dux Normannorum in servitium Sancti Petri post Calendas Maii Romam armata manu invasit; fugato Heinrico, totam urbem Gregorio Papae rebellem, penitus exspoliavit, & majorem ejus partem igni consumpsit, eo quod Romani quen∣dam ejus Militem vulneraverant. Deinde acceptis obsidibus a Romanis, & in Castello Sancti Angeli, quod domum Theodorici dicunt, reservatis, ipse ad recu∣perandam terram sancti Petri reversurus, in brevi plurima Castella, & Civitates Domino Papae recuperavit. Heinricus autem Roberto resistere non valens, ad par∣tes Teutonicorum satis festinanter revertitur.Bertoldi Con∣stantiens. ad Herman: Ap∣pendix, p. 355 Interim Henricus, congregata mul∣titudine schismaticorum, VVecilonem Clericum, Halverstatensis Episcopi fugitivum, Moguntinensi Episcopatu remuneravit, eo quod illi in omni pertinacia contra Do∣minum & sanctum Petrum indefessus cooperator adfuit. Qui ipse jamdudum anathe∣mizatus, & ab anathemizatis electus, nihilominus etiam ab anathemizatis juxta Pelagium Papam non consecratus est: nam juxta beatissimos Patres, Innocenti∣um, Leonem atque Gregorium, nihil nisi damnationem & maledictionem a damnatis accipere potuit; Dominus autem Papa collecta Synodo, iterum sententiam ana∣thematis in Guibertum haeresiarchum, et Heinricum, et omnes eo∣rum fautores promulgavit; quod et in festo sancti Iohannis Bapti∣stae praeterito jamdudum Romae fecit,Anno 1085 cum Heinricus adhuc ibi mora∣retur. Hanc sententiam Legati sedis Apostolicae, videlicet, Petrus Albanensis Epis∣copus in Francia, Otto Ostensis Episcopus in terra Teutonicorum usque quaque divul∣garunt. Qui cum in Alemannia moraretur Sanctae Constantiensi Ecclesiae jamdudum viduatae, Catholicum Episcopum ordinavit, scilicet Gebehardum Bertholdi Duci fili∣um; hunc sane invitum, imo multum ejulantem ac reclamantem, Constantiensibus Clericis et Laicis petentibus & laudantibus, Episcopum consecravit. Bertoldi Con∣stantiensis ad Hermannum, Appendix, p. 355. See Abbas Vspergensis Chronicon, Aventinus An∣nal. Boiorum, l. l. 5, Centur. Magd. 11. c. 10 Hermannus Rex Nativitatem Domini Gostare celebravit, ad quem praefatus Osti∣ensis Episcopus post Epiphaniam pervenit in Saxoniam, & Colloquio interfuit, quod Saxones contra Heinrici fautores condixerunt, ut hoc illis probarent, se jure Hen∣ricum
vitare ut excommunicatum: Quod & facto colloquio decimo quinto die post Epiphaniam, firssime probaverunt, ea videlicet ratione, quia Romanus Pontifex illum eis a se in Romano Synodo anathemizatum, literis denunciavit. Adversarii autem eis objecerunt; quod Papa cum nequiverit excommunicare, eo quod expoliatus non potuerit vocari, judicari sive damnari. Ad hoc Saxones responderunt; Se judicium sedis Apostolicae nec debere retractare, nec posse; hoc cum illo potius tractandum, qui illum damnaverit, non cum Saronibus, quod damnationi ejus non interfuerint, qui sedis Aposto∣licae judicio nullam retractationem sed obedientiam debuerint. Ita ergo soluto colloquio . Eo tempore Hildesheimes Episcopus cum suis sequacibus manus Saxonum vix evasit, eo quod contra commune votum totius Saxoniae Henricianis se admiscuerit. Pro eadem etiam culpa Comes Theodoricus eodem tempore occisus est a nostrae par∣tis fautoribus. Praeratus quoque sedis Apostolicae Legatus praedicto Episcopo, cum nollec , officium penitus interdixit. Hermannus Rex in Quintilineburg Pascha celebravit, ubi & Legatus Domini Apostolici in ipsa Pascha hebdomada Generalem Synodum cum Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, & Abbatibus sancti Petri fi∣delibus, solenniter celebravit. Interfuit autem huic Synodo Gebehardus Reveren∣dissimus Juvaniensis Archiepiscopus; Item Venerabilis Hartungus Magideburgensis Archiepiscopus, cum Suffraganeis. Item Suffraganei Moguntiae sedis de Saxonia, nam Wurceburgensis et Wormatiensis, Augustus quoque, & Constantiensis de Aleman∣nia, quique ipsi Canonica necessitate impediti venire non potuerunt, per legationem suam se sancto Concilio repraesentaverunt, seque per omnia ejusdem Synodi statutis assensuros, mandaverunt. Rex etiam Hermannus cum suis Principibus eidem Synodo interfuit. Cum ergo omnes juxta ordinem suum consedissent, prolata sunt in me∣dium Decreta Sanctorum Patrum de primatu sedis Apostolicae; (to wit, of Pope Hildebrand, and some others of his Gang) quod nulli unquam liceat ejus judicium retrectare, et de ejus judicio judicare. Quod de totius Synodi publica professione laudatum, & confirmatum est: et hoc utique contra Heinricianos qui fideles Sancti Petri constringere voluerunt, ut excommunicationem Domini Papae Gregorii super Heinricum, cum illis retrectare praesumerent. Quidam autem Babenbergensis Clericus, nomine Gunibertus, Romani Pontificis primati: deroga∣re volens, in mediam Synodum se contulit, asserens, Romanos Pontifices hunc sibiSee Gratian, Distinct. 22, 23 40. primatum ascripsisse, non aliunde concessum haereditasse, videlicet, nullus de eorum judicio judicare debeat, nec illi alicujus judicio subjaceant. Qui cum aperte a tota Synodo confutaretur, praecipue tamen a quodam Laico convictus est per illud Evangelicum,Joan. 13. 16. c. 15. 20. Non est discipulus supra Ma∣gistrum; Cum enim hoc generaliter in omnibus Ecclesiasticis ordinibus, observan∣dum deputetur, ne major a minore judicetur, quis hoc Vicario Sancti Petri dene∣gare potuit, quem omnes Catholici pro Domino & Magistro venerantur? (though Christ never made nor owned the Pope for his Vicar, never excommunicated any Emperor, King, but submitted to their powers, and censures too, as this Pope ought to do, not being above his Lord, by this very objected Text) In eadem Synodo, ordinatio Wecilonis, Moguntini invasoris, & Sigefridi Augustensis, & Notberti Curiensis imo omnes ordinationes & consecrationes excommunicatorum, penitus irritae judicatae sunt, juxta decreta Sanctorum Patrum Innocentii, Leonis primi, Pelagii, atque ejus suc∣cessoris Gregorii 1. Item Secta praedicti Wecilonis ejusque sociorum, sub anathe∣mate damnata est,See Avent. An∣nal. Boiorum, l. 5 Abbas Usper∣gensis, anno 1085. p. 225. Centur. Magd. 1. cap. 10. quae asserit, seculares suis rebus expoliatos Ecclesiastico non subjacere judicio, nec excommunicari posse, pro suis excessibus; quaeque excommunicatos absque reconciliatione recipi posse conten∣dit. Statutum est autem ibi, ut quicunque ab Episcopo suo, nec officio nec com∣munione privato, excommunicatus esset, etsi injuste, nullatenus tamen recipere∣tur ad communionem, nisi absolutus Ecclesiastico more. Similiter & pro Sa∣crilegio excommunicatos, decrevit sancta Synodus non recipiendos, absque solita reconciliatione, & nisi dudum, quae sacrilege sibi vendicaverant, reddidissent, &c. In fine autem Synodi sententia anathematis, cum ardentibus candelis promulgata est, in Guibertum Haeresiarcham, sedis Apostolicae pervasorem, et in Apostatas san∣cti

Cent. Magd. 11 c. 10. Aventinus Annal. Boio∣rum, l. 5. Anno 1085. Synodus Moguntiae habetur, cui interfuit Imperator, ubi praesentibus Legatis Romanis, (to wit, of Pope Clements party) omnes Episcopi rebel∣les Imperatori, deponendi judicantur; caeteri vero anathemate, ut videbatur, condemnantur. Ibi etiam communi consilio constituta est Pax Dei: Non multo post substitutis ab Imperatore per parochias abdi∣catorum Praesulibus. In locum Aldeberonis, Mainharans, Werciburgensis, Ecclesiae Praesul ordinatur, the Emperor still retaining his antient right of Investitures. Ad Herman∣num, Appendix p. 357. Bertoldus Constantiensis, of the Hildebrandian faction, thus relates and tra∣duceth this Synods proceedings. Sed hi omnes adversarii Ecclesiae Dei, in tertia hebdo∣mada, post finitam Synodum, suam Moguntiae collegerunt, non Sy∣nodum, sed Conciliabulum, in quo umbratilem sententiam excom∣municationis, contra fideles Sancti Petri deprompserunt, utpote ne quaquam illos excommunicare valentes, sed apertissime seipsos a communione Catholicorum sequestrantes, ut non tantum judicio sanctae Ecclesiae, sed et proprio eorum judicio, sicut omnes haeretici, a Catholicis essent separati. Sedes quoque Catholicorum Episco∣porum viventium, temeraria cupiditate caecati, sibi vendicare non timuerunt. Deus autem omnipotens suis fidelibus per seipsum auxiliari non cessavit, suumque judicium super inimicos sanctae Ecclesiae mirabiliter exercuit. Nam totam pene Italiam, in qua potissimum furebant, tam magni fames obtinuit, ut homines non tantum immunda quaeque, sed etiam humanam carnem manducarent. Quam famem maudita mortalitas subsequuta est, ut nec tertia pars hominum remaneret, sed defici∣ente Colono, maxima pars terrae in solitudinem redacta est. Padus quoque fluvius Logobardiae, ripas suas excedens, multa castella, villas, imo circajacentes regiones penitus submersit, & inhabitabiles reddidit; Ipsa etiam Capita schismaticorum eo tempore, heu misere abiere in locum suum, videlicet Parmensis, & Rhegiensis Epis∣copi; Thedaldus Mediolanensis non Archiepiscopus, sed Antichristus, Adalbertus & Re∣ginherus Marchiones, & Comes Boso, & alii innumerabiles, quorum factione tota pe∣ne Italia contra Dominum Papam, & Sanctum Petrum se erexit. Hi quoque Ma∣thildam (Hildebrands Mistress) prudentissimam ducem & fidelissimam Sancti Petri Militem multis injuriis afecerunt in Italia. Illis autem divina animadversione de medio sublatis, ipsa suam potestatem recuperavit, et Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae in omnibus adminiculari non cessavit, sicque ejus prudentia Mutinensi Ecclesiae & Regiensi atque Pistorensi Catholici Pastores ordinati sunt, by meer force and usurpation.Anno 207 I have presented you with this large relation, how these two Popes Hildebrand and Clement, the Hildebrandian & Imperial Councils, Bishops, parties, excommunica∣ted, execrated, deposed, slaughtered one the other, condemning each others Doctrins, practices, Decrees as schismatical and haeretical: whose judgements, because they may seem partial in their own cases, I shall acquaint you with the resolutions of two Greek Fathers, living if not during, yet very few years before Hildebrands antimonar∣chical Innovations and Positions. The 1. of them isOecumenius, Enarrat. in E∣pist. ad Rom. c. 13. Parisiis 1547. f. 369, 370.

Nam
haec subjectio non evertit, (or invertit) pietatem. Admonet autem hoc Apostolus, osten∣dens; Quod Evangelium non doceat defectionem, vel inobedientiam aut contumaciam, sed benevolentiam magis, ac obedientiam. Magnam ubique capitis hujus rationem habet, ostendens, non ad subversionem communis disciplinae Christi leges esse; quumque suf∣ficientes sint, veritatis causa bellum in Nos gerant; quid, inquit, neces∣se est nobis ipsis superfluos procurare adversarios? Non est potestas nisi a Deo. Princi∣patus enim esse, & hunc quidem gubernare, alium vero gubernari, nec omnia sursum ac de∣orsum ferri, divinae sapientiae opus esse dico, &c. Omnes ergo potestates a Deo ordinatae sive factae sunt, quamcunque consideraveris; sive patris erga filium, sive viri erga uxorem, si∣ve alias omnes, etiam quae in animalibus sint, puta apibus, grubus ac piscibus. Ita{que} quisquis resistit potestati, Dei ordinatiom resistit. Ne abjecti viderentur Christi servi, si Principibus subjicientur, ostendit, quod parere oporteat, et non inobedientes esse Prin∣cipibus; nam qui hoc facit, Deo resistit; qui Principatus constituit, &c.

BesidesAleiados, lib. 1. Edit. August. 1610. p. 31, 32. Annas Comnenas, an antient Greek Historian, writes thus ironically of Hildebrands seditious practices; Iste vero execrandus Papa, cum spirituali gratia, & Evangelica pace tota manu ac mente, princeps a bellum civile progreditur, ille nimirum pacificus atque Pacifici discipulus; ad Saxonum enim mittens Duces, ac tum alias multas eis conditiones offerens, tum etiam se facturum eos Reges occidentis pro∣mittens, ita ad se viros allicit; usque adeo facilem ac promptam ha∣buit ille dextram ad ordinationem Regum: against St. Pauls and Pe∣ters forecited precepts, and presidents.

St. Briget of Sweden (canonized for a Saint by the Bulls of Pope Boniface the 9. and Martin the 5th. prefixed to her Revelations, l. 1. c. 41. printed Nurembergi 1521. brings in Jesus Christ himself thus complaining of 5. sorts of men, quia multipliciter offendunt me, the first whereof is the Pope, (what Pope it was she in∣tended, I cannot certainly define, unlesse it was this Hildebrand) of whom Christ there thus complained; Nunc ego conquerror super te, Capt Ecclesiae meae, qui sedes in seemea, quam Petro & successoribus ejus tradidi ad sedendum in ea, triplici dignitate ac authoritate. Primo, ut potestatem haberent ligandi animas, & solvendi a peccato, Secundo, ut aperirent coelum poenitentibus. Tertio, ut clauderent coelum maledictis & contemnentibus. Sed tu qui deberes solvere animas, & ad me praesentare, tu vere es animarum interfector. Ego eum institui (Petrum) paorem & servatorem ovium me∣arum, Tu autem es dispersor et lacerator earum. Tu autem pejor es Lucifero. Ipse enim habebat ad me invidiam, & nullum concupivit occidere nisi me, ut pro me dominaretur. Tu autem tanto deteriores, quod non solum occides me, removendo me a te per mala opera tua, sed et animas occides per malum exemplum tuum. Ego redemi animas sanguine meo, & commisi eas tibi tanquam amico fideli. Tu autem tradis eas iterato inimico, a quo redemi eas. Tu es injustior Pilato, qui nullum judicabat ad mortem nisi me: Tu autem non solum judicas me quasi nullius Dominatorem, et nullius boni dignum, imo et animas innocentes condemnas, et nocentes dimittis. Tu es immititor Iuda, qui me solum vendit, Tu autem non solum vendis me, sed et animas electorum meorum, pro turpi lucro tuo et vano nomine. Tu es abhominabilior Iudaeis: Ipsi crucifixerunt corpus meum solum; Tu autem crucifigis et punis animas electorum meorum, quibus malicia tua et trans∣gressio amarior est omni gladio. Et ideo, quia tu similis es Lucife∣ro, injustior Pilato, immitior Iuda, abhominabilior Iudaeis, ideo merito conqueror super te. After which she there brings in Christ himself, by S. Peters advice, passing this sentence against the Pope; Haec autem est vera justitia, ut primus qui sedet in sede tua, et opera habet Luciferi, amittat cum contemptu sedem in qua praesumpsit sedere (as Luciferian Pope Hildebrand did) et particeps sit poena Luciferi: Then she introduceth Christ himself swea∣ring thrice by God the Father, his own body, and the holy Ghost, quod faciam ju∣stitiam super hos: and passing this memorable Judgement upon the Pope, his Mi∣nisters, Members, Vicars, adhering to him, Gladius meae severitatis in cor∣pus tuum intrabit, qui a superiori capitis ingredietur, et sic profun∣de et valenter infigetur, ut nunquam extrahatur. Sedes tua mer∣getur quasi lapis ponderosus, qui non subsistat antequam venerit in novissimum profuni: Digiti, id est, assessores, ardebunt igni sulphureo et inextinguibili: Brachia tua, id est Vicarii, ad animarum profectum extendi deberent; sed extenduntur ad utilitatem mundi et honorem; judicabuntur poena

Hildebrandus Papa, qui & Gregorius VII. apud Salernium exulans moritur. Volumus vos scire, qui Ecclesiasticae curae solliciti estis; quia Dominus Apostolicus Hilde∣brandus, qui et Gregorius, nunc in extremis positus, ad se vocavit unum de xij. Cardinalibus quem prae caeteris diligebat, et confes∣sus est, Deo et Sancto Petro, et toti Ecclesiae, se valde peccasse in Pastorali cura, quae ei ad regendum erat commissa, seque sua∣dente Diabolo, contra humanum genus iram Dei et odium concitas∣se. Postea vero sententiam quae in orbe terrarum effusa est, pro aug∣mento Christianitatis revocasse, dicebat. Tunc demum misit prae∣dictum Confessorem suum ad Imperatorem, et ad totam Ecclesiam, ut opraret ei indulgentiam, quia finem vitae suae aspiciebat; et jam cito induturus erat angelicam vestem: et dimisit et dissolvit vin∣cula omnium bannorum suorum Imperatori et omni populo Chri∣stiano, vivis et defunctis, Laicis et Clericis, et jussit suos abire de domo Theodorici, et amicos Imperatoris ascendere. I have more largely related this History of Pope Hildebrands Antimonarchical, as well as Antichristian proceedings, upon these considerations: 1. Because he was the Jac  De Christia∣narum Eccles: secessione & statu, c 5. 6 Aventinus An∣nal. Bolorum l. 5. Onuphrius in vita Greg. 7 first visible founder, erecter of that Antichristian Papal Soveraignty & Tyranny, which his ambitious Successors have since presumed to claim, exercise over Christian Emperors, Kings, Kingdoms, Churches, Prelates: The first who attempted to ex∣communicate, depose, interdict the Roman Emperors, give their Crowns, Kingdoms to o∣thers; to absolve all their subjects from their Oathes of Allegiance to them, and excite Subjects to rebell and take up arms against their rightfull Kings, to dethrone them, for not obeying their Papal Decrees. 2ly. Because he was the chief contriver (before & after his intrusion into Peters pretended Chair) how to deprive the Roman Emperors of their antient hereditary Soveraign Ecclesiastical right of electing, ratifying, investing, con∣firming Popes, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops; and to defraud, robb all other Christian Kings, Princes, Nobles, Lay-Patrons of their Patronages, Presentati∣ons, Collations to Bishopricks, Benefices, or any other Ecclesiastical dignities, under the false pretext of Simony, Heresie, Sacriledge, Idolatry, wherewith he branded it, on purpose to monopolize the sale and disposal of them to himself and his Successors, to make allPlatina, Onu∣phrius, Marti∣nus Polonus, Barnes, Balaeus, in Gregor. 7.

Bishops, Clergymen, and Religious Orders sworn Vassals, Feudato∣ries, Votaries, Servants to, and sole Dependants on the See of Rome, but perfidious Traytors, Rebels to their own natural Kings, Princes, as exempted from, and having no Dominion over them, nor engagements to them. 3ly. Because he was the first Pope who violently persecuted married Priests, prohibiting all Laymen to hear their Masses, &c. unlesse they were totally divorced from their wives in obedience to his Papal Decrees.
Which Antichristian Usurpations, Innovations of his being the Original ground, president of all his Successors intollerable Encroachments on, proceedings of like nature against our English Kings, and their Soveraign Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction; and the Emperor Henries oppositions against him and his encroachments, a grand en∣couragement to our Kings vigorous oppositions against his successors usurpations of like nature in England; (the chief Subject of my ensuing History;) I deemed it not only expedient, but absolutely necessary, to present the world with a full and faith∣full Narrative of his Hildebrandian Antimonarchical Sentences, Decretals, Proceedings; the opositions made against them, which have ever since infested all Christian States, Churches, with high contests, schisms, wars between the Crown and Miter: And be∣fore I procceed to his Successors, I shall give you this further Account of these 3. par∣ticulars, beginning with the Original ground of the quarrel, Investitures and Simony. I haveHere, p. 216, 217, 219, 241, 243, 244, 245, 246. formerly discovered how some of Hildebrands immediate Predecessors (by his advice and instigation) made several Decrees, Constitutions against Clergy-mens receiving Investitures, or Presentations to Bishopricks & Ecclesiastical Benefices from Lay-mens hands, under the false odious crime of Simony, to render it detestable to the ignorant vulgar, which produced little or no effect, till Hildebrand himself, as Legat to Pope Stephen the 9th. and others, put them in vigorous execution,Chron. An∣tonini Tit. 16 c. 1. Sect. 21 depriving many Bishops and others, in France, Germany, under the Notion of Simoacks, which he more violently prosecuted after he became Pope. Hence our famous HistorianDe Gestis Regum, l. 3. p. 107, 108. William of Malmesbury, living in that age, stories; Quod alii Pontifices inusitaverant (mussitaverant readsHist. Papatus p. 247. Morney) palam extulit, excommunicans electos, qui investituras Ecclesiarum de manu Laici per annulum et baculum acciperent. Unde Imperator Henri∣cus Alemannorum, fremens quod sine sua conscientia talia praesumeret, et quod excommunicationem in eum propter Investituras Ecclesia∣rum promulgaverat, cum exercitu veniens Romam obsedit, Hildebrandum expulit, Guibernum Ravennatem introducit; This being the original occasion of all the Diffe∣rences, Contests, Wars between them.

Est omnino iniquum (sicut ait Plinius) sed nobis quoque usu jam receptum, quod honesta consilia vel turpia, prout male vel prospercedunt, ita aut probantur, vel reprehenduntur. Inde plerum{que} eadem facta, modo superstitionis, modo pietatis, mo∣do Christi, modo Antichristi, modo justiciae, modo tyrannidis nomina accipiunt. Diu∣tius in se Christiani Principes, summa pietatis ac religionis jactura debac∣chati sunt (concerning Investitures.) Vicit tandem Romanorum Flaminum fortuna. He elswhere observes, ThatAnnal.

Alii verbis quidem ambitus crimen abominabantur; sed plus auri sub magna pi∣etatis superficie, dum se gratis dare cuncta jactant, corrasere, plurisque Sacra ve∣num dedere. Et tu vigilantissime Gregori, quidnam faceres, si nunc demum natus esses, quando divitias, opes ambire, Sacerdotia cauponari, sacra nundinari, & quasi defectos caballos, juxta commune dictum, commutare, jus est, et longinqua consue∣tudo, vulgo dici saepius audio! Caeremoniae cum Pontifice, ara cum sacri∣ficulo, templum cum aedituo, omnia venalia sunt. A Pontificibus minoribus, quos Sacrificos vocamus, sexcenti exiguntur aurei nummi, in tantum ut quosdam hoc munus obiisse poenituerit: et quos∣dam designatos, rursus quod non esset unde avaritiae Romanensium corvorum satiarent, abdicasse norim; fenus quod ab aliis Pontif: reddi∣tur, quotannis a templis abraditur, majus est quam ut a me (licet nume∣rorum abaci perito) numerari queat.

Chron. An∣tonini Tit. 1. c. 3. sect. 21. f. 123. Tit. 17. c. 1. f. 177 Antoninus (with others) makes this Popes Decree against Investitures per annulum & baculum, and proceedings thereupon against the Emperor, the ground of all their longlasting controversies; Quumque (writes he) jam pax inter Sacerdotium & regnum videretur intervenisse; rursus suadente Diabolo in Papam & Imperatorem schisma gravissimum ortum est. Cujus Schismatis causa haec fuisse videtur. Inoleverat consuetudo. praecipue in Imperio (aSee Bode∣chini Abbatis appendix ad Chronica Ma∣ani Scot, an. 1110. p. 465 Walthramus Naumburgens.

Caroli Magni Temporibus per 200. annos et amplius concessa et observata sub Summis Pontifici∣bus illius temporis;) qua defungentibus Ecclesiarum Praelatis, annulus et baculus Pastoralis ad Dominum Imperatorem diri∣gebatur, unde postmodum unum, quemlibet de familiaribus et capellanis suis ad Ecclesiam vacantem dirigebat, ut ibi Pastoris fungeretur officio, non expectata Cleri electione. Quod Dominus Papa contra omnem honestatem fieri considerans, et jura Ecclesi∣astica in eo conculcari perpendens, semel, secundo, et tertio Impe∣ratorem monuit, ut a tam detestabili praesumptione desisteret. Quumque praeceptis salutaribus commonitum, illum revocare non posset, et hoc suum esse jus allegat: ob hanc causam Gregorius Romae Con∣cilium congregavit 110 Episcoporum; In quo primo ipsum Henricum excommunicavit Imperatorem, tanquam perjurum et Ecclesiae Dei persecutorem et subversorem. Anathematizaverunt autem insuper, omnes Ecclesiasticas personas qui de manu alicujus secularis personae acciperent Investituram, et omnes Simoniacos anathe∣matizavit. Inde grave ortum est scandalum: ita ut nullius Haeresis tempore Ecclesia Occidentalis graviori schismate sit divisa. Hi pro justitia, alii pro injustitia agebant. Alii a Simonia non declinabant. Aliis notam avaritiae honesto nomine praetexentibus, dum hoc quod se gratis dare, jactant, sub charitatis nomine vendunt. Et (ut de Montano dicit Eusebius) sub nomine ob∣lationis artificius munera accipiunt. Pope,Chronicon Hildebrands Decrees against Investitures and Simony, are thus recorded by Antonin. tit. 16. c. 1. sect. 21 tit 17. c. 1. Cent. Magd. 11 c. 7. col. 374, 485. Gratian Caus 16. qu. 7. & Distinct. 33. ox Acts and Monuments, Vol. 1. with sundry others.

Offi∣cium Simoniacorum, scienter nullo modo recipiatis, & quantum potestis tales san∣ctis Ministeriis ubi oportuerit, prohibete. De Gestia Regum, l. 2. c. 3. p. 84 William of Malmsbury records that Hildebrands Predecessor Gregory the 6. in an Oration to his Cardinals at Rome, (when being sick and likely to die, ausu te∣merario persuaderent, ne se in Ecclesia Sancti Petri cum caeteris Apostolicis tumulari praeciperet, qui tot hominum mortibus officium faedasset;) used this expression to them concerning investitures. Laudatus est olim praedicandae memoriae praedecessor noster Adrianus primus, quod Investituras Ecclesiarum Carolo Magno con∣cesserit, ita ut nullus Electus consecraretur ab Episcopo, nisi prius a Rege insigniretur annulo et baculo. Contra, laudatur in seculi no∣stri Pontificibus, quod has donationes tulerunt Principibus, Pote∣rat tunc rationabiliter concedi, quod nunc laudabiliter debet auferri. Cur ita? Quod erat animus Magni adversus avaritiam invictus, nec facile invenisset aditum aliquis, nisi intrasset per ostium. Praeterea, perDoth not the same reason still remain? tot terrarum insterstitia ne∣quibat requiri sedes Apostolica, ut unicuique electo accommodaret assensum su∣um, dum esset prope Rex, qui nihil per avaritiam disponeret, sed juxta sacra Ca∣nonum scita religiosas personas Ecclesis introduceret. Nunc omnia Palatia Regum, luxus & ambitus occupavit. Quare merito libertatem suam sponsa Christi asseverat, ne illam Tyrannus ambitioso usurpatori prostituat. Upon which pretexts, Pope Hildebrands made these Decrees, to rob Emperors and all others of Investitures, that Popes alone might enjoy the sales of all preferments. HenceDe Planctu Ecclesia lib. 2. artic. 15. f. 118. L. et artic. 2. f. 104. Alvarus Pelagius a Spanish Freer, flourishing about the year 1320.

Mundet igitur Dei Vicarius Curiam suam consuetudinibus Simonaicis, quia ad ipsum pauci intrant, qui non solvunt.

Vix credo, maxi∣me in Hispania, quod de Centum Episcopis sit unus, qui non sit Simoniacus in ordi∣nibus & beneficiis conferendis: Nam nec propter aliud Ordines celebrant, dantes suas benedictiones, a Domino maledicti, nisi ut lucrentur pecunias: unde in una or∣dinatione lucrabitur ibi Episcopus, nunc per expressas, nunc per tacitas Simonias suarum literarum, sigillorum, portatorum, matricularum obtentu CCCC. & quin∣gentos, et eo amplius frequenter Florenos.

Recor∣dentur Domini Praelati & alii Clerici de Crasso Dictatore Romano, qui aurum sitivit, & aurum bibit, aeque periit vero auro, sicut vero veneno.

Not long after, the antient Rythmus printed at the end ofOpera Lug∣duni Bat. 1613 Nicholaus de Clemangiis his Treatise de Corrupto Ecclesiae Statu, p. 29, 30. thus complained of the Simony and Bribery of the Court of Rome; Ibi nemo gratus gratis; Nulli datur absque datis, Gratiam gratia. Plumbum quod hic informatur Super aurum dominatur, Et Massam argenteam. Sic instillant el Draconis, Et in sine Lectionis, Cogunt Bursam vomere.

Foris Petrus, intus Nero; Intus Lupi, foris vero Sicut Agni ovium, &c. Cuncta vorat sicut Leo, &c. Nicholaus de Clemangiis himself, Archdeacon of Baion, about the year 1430. in his Book De Corrupto Ecclesiae statu, c. 11. 15. & De Praesulibus Simoniacis, makes the like complaints as Alvarus Pelagius of the intollerable Simony of Popes, Cardinals, and Bishops, which you may there peruse at leisure. The Author ofPrinted Co∣loniae 1531. Onus Ecclesiae (a Popish conscientiousEpiscopus Chiemnensis, as some conjecture German Bishop, living above 150. years since) cap. 19. De Indispositione Romanae Curiae, thus complains, sect: 8, 11, 12. Heu, sicut olim in Romano Imperio, sic hodie in Romana Curia, est vorago divitiarum turpissima; crevit avaritia, periit Lex a Sacerdo∣te, & visio a propheta, & consilium a senioribus: Claves Ecclesiae sunt in abusu, et servitute Simoniae et Ambitionis: Vitia enim ferme Curialium caela∣ri, negarique vix possunt. Roma quasi gurges flagitiorum: (Sequitur ex Bri∣githa) Papa qui clamare deberet,Mat. 11. Venite, & invenietis requiem animarum ve∣strarum; clamat, Venite ad Curiam meam, & videte me in purpura & ambitione plusquam Solomonem: Venite ad Curiam meam, & exhaurite bursas vestras, & in∣venietis perditionem animarum vestrarum: Sic enim clamat exemplo et fa∣cto. Ecce Roma nunc est Vorago et mammon inferni, ubi Diabo∣lus totius avaritiae Capitaneus residet. vendens Patrimonium Christi, quod sua passione nobis promeruit: qui nobis praecepit, ut gratis demus, quod gratis acceperimus. Idcirco versum est in Proverbium; Curia Romana non petit ovem sine lana: Dantes exaudit, non dantibus ostia claudit. In Curia Romana residet superbia maxima, cupiditas insatiabilis, luxuria mihi (Christo) execrabilis, ac etiam vorago pessima horribilis Simoniae. He adds,cap. 13. sect: 28. Sylvester secundus, per Simoniam et Magicam ar∣tem Pontificatum est consecutus. (Since which time) ultra quingentos annos usque modo ex divina permissione solutus est Satanas, qui suas malas immissiones non solum in adversarios Ecclesiae, id est infideles, sed etiam in ipsius Ecclesiae mem∣bra, id est, in Christianos reprobos effundit, operando in eis fallacias, & novas & inuntatas machinationes & oppressiones.Cap. 15. sect. 32. Plerique contra Ecclesiastica Statuta in Pontifices Simoniace electi, ambitiose intrusi, & aliquando in tantum vitiati fue∣runt, quod rursus ab Ecclesia rejecti, e sede expulsi, damnatique sunt, ac interdum propter suos defectus manifeste a Deo percussi. Cap. 20. D Excessibus Praelatorum: & cap. 21. De Praelatorum altorumque Curatorum vita vitiosa, he thus complaines: O quanta nunc est obduratio ab Ecclesia Dei! Com∣muniter ad Praelaturas intrant Simoniaci. Praelati sunt superbi, vani, pomposi, simo∣naici, avari, luxuriosi, ambitiosi, aut aliter vitiosi, &c. taking their president from Popes themselves. And cap. 25. sect. 9. Simonia contra Canonum Decreta in Clero jam ubique regnat. A minori usque ad majorem omnes Clerici avaritiae student,
Qui dicunt, aquam nostram, id est donum Spiritus sancti pecunia bibimus, hoc est Simoniace administramus sacramenta Dei: ideo subjungitur: Linguam nostram pretio comparavimus, &c. Et tamen ad majoris damnationis cumulum illam Simonaicam pravitatem ex inveteratae consuetudinis jure, quidam malitiose defendere nituntur, qui cum Giezi & Simone condemnabuntur. I shall cloze up this Discourse concerning Hildebrands and other Popes Decrees a∣gainst Investitures and Simony, with these memorable passages ofClaudium E∣pencaeum in Epistolam Pauli ad Titum, Pa∣risiis, 1568. p. 71, 72. Claudius Es∣spencaeus, (a learned Popish French Bishop) in his Commentarie upon Pauls Epistle to Titus; wherein he complains, that Popes and Popish Councils, instead of the long expected and promised reformation of the scandalous sinne of Simony, tot omnibus votis expectatum, atque a Paulo 3. viris doctissimis atque gravissimis delectis, delegata; who found and informed him, Ejus Sanctitatem hodiernorum malorum inde principium esse; quod Praedecessores ejus nonnulli prurientes auribus coacervaverunt sibi Magistros ad desideria sua, non ut a quibus discerent, quid facere deberent, sed quorum calliditate inve∣niretur ratio, qua liceret, quod liberet. Hinc effectum, ut prodirent adulatores potius quam Doctores, qui docerent,See Antonii de Rosellis Mo∣narchia pars 2. cap. 15. Papa beneficiorum omnium esse Dominum; ac ideo cum Dominus jure vendat id quod suum est, necessario sequi, in eum non cadere Simoniam: Ex hocSimoniam in Pontif.

Hanc praecipue ob causam Christianismum deridentes atque blas∣phemantes. Non licere ergo nec Christi Vicario in usu Clavium, sive potestatis, ab eo illi collatae lucrum aliquod comparare, hoc est gratis datum, non gratis dare, &c. He then observes, that from the gross notorious Simony of Popes, and their open, shameless sales of all sacred things, yea sales of Dispensations, for all detestable sins, all other Bishops, Clergy-men, and their Officials, openly practised this gainfull Trade of Simony.Ibid. pag. 66. 67, 68, 74, 75.

These were the fruits, designs of Pope Hildebrands decrees a∣gainst Simony, that he and his Successors might be the sole Merchants of all Eccle∣siastical Preferements, Indulgences, Pardons, Sins and universal Simoniacks in and over the Church of Christ. All which (with other historical passages hereafter cited) duly considered, it will appear most just, rational, advantagious for the Church of Christ, that as the Investi∣tures, Donations, Collations of the Papacy it self, all other Bishopricks and Ecclesiasti∣cal Benefices, did antiently of right belong to Christian Emperors, Kings, Princes, till forcibly wrested out of their hands by Popes and Popish Prelats: so they should in all Realms henceforth resume, perpetuat thē in their hands; not in Popes, Bishops or Cler∣gymens, who have bin so universally, infamously overspread, defiled with the foulest Leprosy of real Simony, as this grand reformer of Simoniaks, Hildebrand was.

thus publickly uttered by the Cardinal in the Pulpit, before the Pope himself, his Cardinals, Court, Clergy, and all the Citizens summoned to hear his Farewel Sermon, preached by the Pope's appointment, and in his name, right, was certainly an un∣questionable though satyrical truth, That the Pope, his Cardinals, Prelates, Court, had made that whole City (as they had done Rome whiles there) but one universal continued Stewes from East to West: such was the fruit of their vowed chastity. 5ly.

VVhores, to satisfie his unsatiable lustfull cloystred Virginity; which enforced Godly Christian Princes, by their Supreme Ecclesiastical Authority, to suppress when they could not reform these Nurseries of Uncleaness. These prodigious, unchast, sodomical consequences of pro∣hibiting Priests marriages are a sufficient evidence not only of the lawfulness, but ex∣pedience, yea necessity of their marrying, when or where they cannot live chast without it;Caus. 6. qu. 2. Gratian himself confessing, Copula Sacerdotalis, nec Legali, nec Evange∣lica, nec Apostolica authoritate prohibetur; the legality whereof in point of conscience, I shall briefly evidence against all Hildebrandians by these following Scripture Argu∣ments, wherewith I long since so silenced a vaunting Romish Priest, (who held our Ministers no Priests because married) that he had not one word to reply. 1. That God himself instituted Marriage in the state of InnocencyGen: 1. 27, 28 c. 2. 19, to 29. before Adam's fall, when he had nearest communion with God; therefore it cannot defile or in∣capacitate any of his posterity, to be a Bishop, Priest or Minister of God. 2ly. That Gods primitive command to Adam and Eve in the state of Innocency at the first institution of Matrimony; and to Noah and his Sons after the stood;Gen: 1. 27. c. 9. 1. Increase and multiply, and replenish the earth, by the use of lawfull Matrimony; extended to A∣dam, Noah, and all their Posterity in succession to the end of the world; (and that as a special priviledge and benediction, not a curse; it being aGen. 11. 30, &c. c. 15. 2. c. 25. 21. c. 29. 3. c. 30. 3. 1 Sam. 6. 23.

Therefore to Priests, Clergy-men, they all being Adam's and Noah's posterity, as well, as much as others, and so not to be debarred from this special blessing. 3ly. ThatSee here, p. 2, 3, 4. Gen. c. 5, & 10. throughout. Adam himself, and the first born, Patriarch of every Family, during the law of Nature, even from Adam's creation till the institution of the Levitical Priesthood, were the only Priests and Ministers of God to offer Sacrifices, instruct their Children, Families in the fear and worship of God, to bless them, and pray for them: Now these were1 Chron. c. 1, & 1, & 2, &c. Mat. 1. married to propagate Mankind, perpetuate Posterity, and the Church, by God's own precept, without the least restraint or any impediment at all to their primitive Priesthood; Therefore Priests may be so too under the Gospel. 4ly.

High-priests succeding him, who were types of Christ himself, andHebr. 9. 6, 7, &c. entred once a year at least into the Holy of Holyes, were all married, having Wives and Children: That the o∣ther Levit. c. 1, & 2, & 3. 1 Chron: c. 6, & 23, & 24. throughout. Levitical Priests, Levites and Church-officers under the Law, were all married, or permitted freely to marry without restraint, being High-priests, Priests, Levites only by descent and succession in the self-same Tribe, not by election and mere ordination; God himself prescribing whatLevit. 21. 1, 7, 9, to 16, 24. Persons they should marry, and what not; their Wives, Marriages, Children, no wayes disabling or hindering them from the exe∣cution
of their Priestly Offices, as the Scriptures abundantly evidence. Yea the Prophets likewise had both2 Kngs 9. 1. Amos 7. 14. Ezech. 24. 8. Wives and children under the Law; therefore all Bi∣shops, Priests, Prophets, Ministers under the Gospel, by parity of reason may, or ought to be married, and to enjoy their Wives, Children without any impediment to their Ministry: There being no divine inhibition to the contrary, as Clemens Alex∣andrinus Stromatum. l. 3. & 7. long since resolved. 5ly. ThatJohn 22 1, to 12. Christ himself, under the Gospel, with his Mother and Disciples honored Marriage not only with their presence at it, but by Christs working his very first Miracle, in turning water into Wine, to adorn this Solemnity, and manifest his glory thereat. 6ly. That Christ in theMat. 19. 1, to 10. Mat. 10. 2, to 13. Gospel, not only, not repealed, but approved, ratified the use of Marriage according to its primitive institution at the creation, which he re∣hearsed, reducing the Jews unto it, who had swarved therefrom: adding this farther divine seal and codicil thereunto; What God hath therefore joyned together, let no man put asunder. By which he justified its use, lawfulness under the Gospel, to be as uni∣versal, extensive, free from the least restriction in relation to Priests, as it was at the Creation, and before his incarnation, and prohibitsSee Gratian Distinct. 37. Priests divorses from their Wives, by any human or Papal Roman Canons whatsoever. 7ly. That it is evident both1 Cor. 9. 5. Mat. 8. 14. Mar. 1. 30. Lu. 38. Mar. 10. 18, 19. Lu: 18. 28, 29. Psal: 3, 4. Acts 21. 8, 9. by Scriptures, andIgnatii Epist: ad Philadelph. Clem. Alexand. Strom: l. 4. Ori∣gen in Epist: ad Romanos, c. 1. l. 1. Eusebius Eccles: Hist: l. 3. c. 30. Omnes Apostoli excepto Johanne, Uxores habuerunt, Ambrose in 2 Cor. 11. Fathers, that the Apostle Peter himself, James, Philip the Evangelist, all Christs Apostles except Saint John, yea St. Paul himself were married, and had Wives, without any reprehension, restraint from Christ, or disability to exercise their Apostolical, Episcopal or Ministerial functi∣ons. Therefore all other Evangelists, Bishops, Elders, Priests, Deacons, may law∣fully and laudably marry, without prejudice to their Spiritual functions, as well as they: as sundry godlySee Bishop Jewels Defence of the Apology, 2 part, cap: 6. p. 207, 208, &c. Bishop Halls honour of the married Clergy. Bishops, Priests, Deacons, and several Popes too mar∣ried and had Wives in the primitive Ages of the Church, for many hundred years af∣ter Christ, (as they ever had and still have in the Greek Churches) till, yea after Hildebrands time, when they were by force and absolute tyranny divorsed from them. 8ly. The Spirit of God resolves by Paul himself, ThatHebr. 13. 4. Marriage is honourable to ALL (whether Male or Female; Popes, Bishops, Monks, Priests, Clergy-men of all sorts, as well as others) and the Bed undefiled. Therefore to all Popes, Bishops, unmarried Priests, Votaries, unlesse they will deny themselves to be comprised un∣der the universal word All, and make themselves Beasts or Angels. But Whore∣mongers and Adulterers (asSee John Bales Acts of English Vota∣ies. The Ana∣tomy of the English Nun∣nery at Lis∣bon. most unmarried Prelates, Priests and Romish Votaries have been, and still are) God will judge. 9ly. God himself by the Truth inspired hand, pen of Saint Paul, gives this univer∣sal advise, if not precept to every man and woman,1 Cor. 7. 2, 9. Let EVERYMAN (therefore every Pope, Bishop, Priest, Deacon, as well as Layman) have his own Wife, and every Wo∣man her own Husband, rendring this unanswerable reason for it, for it is better to marry then to burn; better for every man, for any man; Therefore for Popes, Bishops, Priests, Monks, who burn as much, if not more than any others. 10ly. ThatEphes. 5. 22, to 33. marriage, (especially of Christs Ministers under the Gospel) most lively represents, typifies to Christians, the conjugal union, love, affection that is between our Lord Iesus Christ, his Church, and every true Believer; the Church in Scripture being stiledCant: 1. 8, to 13. c. 5. 1. Christ's Spouse, theRev: 21. 9. Lamb's wife, to whom he is said toMat. 22. 2, 4. c 25. 10. Jer. 3. 14. Rev: 19. 7, 9. Jer. 31. 32. c. 54. 5. be mar∣ried, yea to be her Husband, and to whose marriage all Christians are invited. There∣fore it can no ways unfit, or disable Popes, Bishops, Priests, Ministers (who pretend they have nearest approaches to, and union, communion with Jesus Christ, engrossing to themselves the Title of his Church, Spouse) to enjoy or execute their holy Functi∣ons in his Church, as Popes decree and dictate. 11ly. That God himself by St. Paul (the only pretended Patron, Patern of Priests single, unmarried lives) hath in precise terms, in two several Epistles to1 Tim. 3. 2, 4, 10, 11, 12. Timo∣thy andTitus 1. 6. c. 2. 4, 5. Titus, (Diocesan Bishops of Ephesus and Creet, as mostSee my Un∣bishoping of Timothy and Titus. Pontificians and Prelates assert) prescribed Marriage as a necessary qualification, amongst others, for all Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, allowing them, (without the least inhibition or restraint) to be the Husband of one Wife, yea to have Wives and Children lawful∣ly begotten on them, in these positive words: A Bishop then must be blameless, the Husband of one Wife, vigilant, &c. one that ruleth well his own House, having his Children in subjection, with all gravity. Like∣wise
must the Deacons be grave, &c. Let the Deacons be the Hus∣bands of one Wife, ruling their Children and their own Houses well: Even so must their Wives (to wit, of Presbyters, Bishops, Deacons,) be grave, no Slanderers, sober, faithfull in all things, chast, Keepers at home, &c. Which qualifications were purposely inserted into these Texts by Gods special pro∣vidence, to justifie the lawfulness of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons marriages, wives, and conjugal estate, against all Papal subsequent Decrees, Canons prohibiting them; Which qualifications bothGratian Di∣stinct. 26, to 33.

Ordo, Clerici, Uxor, &c. Gratian, and other Popish Canonists, Writers concerning the Ordination, qualification of Bishops, Priests, Deacons, recite, retain: yet impu∣dently endeavour to elude by these two irrational shifts, diametrically repugnant to the words and sence of these unanswerable Texts. The 1. evasion is,Evasion 1. That the Husband of one Wife, is intended only of the time past, of Bishops, Priests, Deacons, before they are admitted in to these Orders, not present or future time; of such who are to be actually ordained Bishops, Priests, Deacons, at the time of their Ordination, or after admittance to these Orders. To wit,See Gratian Distinct. 26, 27 &c. the Statute of By∣gamy, 4 E. 1. c. 5. Cook. 2. In∣stit p. 273. Papae Greg. 9 Decr. l. 6. Decr. 2. 1 that no Person who hath had two Wives, either together or successively, or maried a Widow, though both Wives be actually dead or divorced from him, ought to be ordained a Bishop, Priest or Deacon, or admitted to claim or enjoy the benefit of Clergy in criminal cases: but only single Per∣sons, or such who have formerly had but one Wife, from which they must be separa∣ted either by death or divorce, before they must be ordained; their actual marriage and cleaving to one Wife, disabling them by their Papal Constitutiors either to re∣ceive Orders, or to retein or exercise these their Functions after their Ordinations. I answer,Answer. 1. That this Papal restriction of Paul's qualifications only to such as are to be ordained Bishops, Priests, Deacons, before their Ordination, without rela∣ting to those who are such, is 1. Directly contrary to the letter of the Text; which de∣scribes the qualifications of such who areLeo 1. Epist. 87 Ambrose, Primasius, Chrysost. Sedul, Theod. The∣oph. Oecum. on 1 Tim. 3. & Tit. 1. actual Bishops, Priests, Deacons, as well at and after the time of their ordinations, as before, as the words in the present and fu∣ture (not preterperfect) tence, A Bishop then must be blameless, the Husband of one Wife, &c. positively resolve. Now no Person by theGratian Di∣stinct. 91, 92. Summa Ro∣sella, Angelica, Hostiensis, and others, Tit. Clericus, Ordo Sacerdos, Epi∣scopus, Prae∣dicatio, Sacra∣mentum. Popes, Canonists, Schoolmens resolutions, is or can be a Bishop, Priest, Deacon, or exercise these Functions in the Church before he be actually ordained: Therefore this qualification applyed to them as and whiles they are Bishops, Priests, Deacons, must be intended after their ad∣mission to these Orders, rather than before. 2ly. This restriction of it only to the time past, preceding their Ordinations; turns, A Bishop then must be the Husband of one wife; Let the Deacons be the Husband of one wife, into, Let him not be the Husband of one, or any wife at all, whiles either a Bishop, Priest or Deacon. A di∣ametrical contradiction to the Texts. 3ly. The subsequent clauses relating to their wives, children, Even so must their Wives be grave, &c. having faithfull children in subje∣ction, ruling their children and their own houses well, refer not only to the time preceding their Ordinations, but subsequent thereunto, since they cannot be actually divorced from their Children, Housholds, at or after their Ordinations, against theTim. . 8 laws of God, Nature, though they may be from their Wives: Therefore the Husband of one Wife, must have the same construction in point of Time. 4ly. All the other qualifications there actually coupled with and surrounding this (the Husband of one Wife) are principally intended of those who are actually Bishops, Priests, Deacons, both when and after they are ordained such, rather than before, viz. A Bishop then must be blameless, vigilant, sober, modest, of good behaviour, given to hospitality; not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy of lucre; but patient, not a brauler, not covetous. One that ruleth his own house with all gravity (for if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the Church of God?) Not a Novice, &c. Moreover, he must have a good report of those that are without, &c. Likewise must the Deacons be grave, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre, holding the mystery of Faith in a pure conscience, &c. If all these qualifications be intended of such who are actual Bishops, Priests, Deacons, as well when and after they receive orders, as before their ordination, then the husband of one wife, &c.See Concil. Crangr. c. 4. ▪ Constantinop. Gratian Dist: 31, 37. Je∣rom. in Jovini∣anum, l. 1. must have the self-same construction being conjoyned with them. 5ly. It would be a monstrous, ridiculous, untheological interpretation to restrain all these qualifications to Bishops, Priests, Deacons, only
in the time before their Ordinations, not after them: For example, every Person to be made a Bishop, Priest, Deacon must, and ought to be blameless, vigilant, so∣ber, of good behaviour, apt to teach, not given to wine, no striker, not given to fil∣thy lucre; &c. before he be ordained, but when and after he is made a Bishop, Priest, Deacon, then he must be no longer thus qualified; but as he was and must be the hus∣band of one wife, only before his Ordination, not after, so for congruity-sake (if this be the true meaning of this Text) by the same Papal interpretation, he may and must be ( to many degenerating Popes, Bishops, Priests, Deacons) blameworthy, , unsober, of ill behaviour, un-hospital, unapt to teach, or an un-preaching , given to wine, awarier, striker, greedy of filthy lucre, impatient, a brawler, , not ruling his own House, Children well, lifted up with pride, not having a good report, not holding the mysterie of Faith in a pure Conscience. And is not this n interpretation well beseeming a Popes unerring Chair, very suitable to St. Pauls and Gods own meaning? This interpretation suits well with out Gildas, and St. Bernards observations, complaints of the Bishops in their ages: Fratres, sic facit hodie, multos  Diabolos Episcopos. Ubi enim, proh Dolor, Repe∣riemus Episcopos, qui post adeptam dignitatem in humilitate se con∣tincant, &c. Male vivunt, et subjectos male vivere volunt. Porro, hujus temporis avaritiam quomodo declinent? Quod enim sine miserabili non est, Christi opprobria, sputa, flagella, clavos, lanceam, crucem & mortom, haec omnia in fornaci avaritiae conflant, & profligant in acquisitione tu∣pis , &c. Vendunt homicidia, adulteria, incestus, fornicationes, sacrilegia, perjuria, &  ad summum implent manticas suas, &c. Animarum nec casus reputatur nec salus, &c. And with Petrus Blesensis Archdeacon of Bath his obser∣vation: requens est inter Episcopos aliquem invenire, qui primum suae promoti∣onis annum dedicat sanctati, cumque in sua novitate factus est agnus, inveteratus ali∣quot dierum fit rapacissimus lupus, &c. What chast Bishops, Priests, Deacons, Vo∣taries, they prove after their enring into religious Orders, abjuration of Marriage and lawfull wives, you have heard before: Perchance to make these Qualifications only antecedent, not concurrent with, not subsequent to their Ordinations, nor conco∣mitant or dependent on them, as they do the husband of one wife. The 2d. Evasion is this, That the Husband of one Wife is to be interpreted on∣ly Metaphoricallie, not properlie, That is, a Bishop, Priest, Deacon, ought to have only one Wife; that is, one Bishoprick, one Benefice, Church, or Ecclesiastical Living with Cure of Souls, and no more, not of a proper wedded Wife, This is a strained, pittifull eluding of these Texts, pointblanck against the words, meaning, yea fatal to the former Popish evasion. For 1. The husband of one wife,Awer. is never taken in this sense in the Old or New Te∣stament, for the Bishop, Priest, Parson, Rector of one Bishoprick, Parochial Church, Synogogue, or Congregation, but in a litteral genuine sense: Therefore it must be so intended here. 2ly. All the other recited qualifications of Bishops, Priests, Deacons, here conjoyned withit, are taken, interpreted only in their proper, not in any allegorical, analogical, tropological or metaphorical sense: Therefore this ought to be so too. 3ly. The qualifications here required in their Wives, in direct terms: Likewise must their Wives be grave, not Slanderers, sober, faithfull in all things, chast, keepers at home, &c. are all improper, unapplicable to a Bishoprick, Be∣nefice, or Parochial Church in any sense; being peculiar only to real Wives and Women; Therefore it can only be meant, interpreted of such. 4ly. These Clauses, A Bishop, Priest, Deacon, must be one that ruleth well his own House, having faithfull children in subjection, ruling their own children and their houses well, are put in direct opposition to publick Churches, Benefices; the children here onely intended, are chil∣dren begotten of their proper Wives bodies, (as the children of High-priests, Priests, Levites were under the Law) not children spiritually engendred by the ministry of the Word: as will be yet more evident by comparing these Texts with 1 Tim. 2. 15. Notwithstanding she shall be saved by Child-bearing, & ch. 5. 10, 14. If she have brought up children: I will therefore that the young women marry, bear children, guide the house, (all used in a proper litteral sense, in the same Epistle;) Therefore children must be thus interpreted in these Texts too, not in a strained Metaphorical sense or con∣struction. 5ly. If by this one Wife, be only meant one Bishoprick or Benefice, then
why do Popes or Popish Prelates dispense with their having Pluralities, against sun∣dry Concil. Agathense, Can. 57. Calcdonense, Can. 10. Epaunense Can. 19. apud Palatium Vernis, Can. 6. Nicaenum 2.

And if the husband of one wife, that is, of one Bishop∣rick, or Benefice, be a previous qualification to his ordination; a Lay-man shall then be capable of a Bishoprick or Benefice before he is in Or∣ders: so as this Text remains unanswerable, to justifie the Lawfulnesse of Bishops, Priests, Dea∣cons Marriages, notwithstanding Pope Hilde∣brauds or others Decrees, as Claudius Espencaeus (a learned Popish Bishop) acknowledgeth, in his Commentaries on 1 Tim. 3. 2. & Tit. 1. 5, 6. 12ly. God himself, by a prophetical Spirit, not only predicted, but in precise terms pre-condemned in this very Epistle of Paul (where he permits, prescribes Bi∣shops, Priests, Deacons, to be the Husband of one wife) the forbidding of Priests wives mariage, as unlawfull, as the very doctrine of1 Tim. 4. ▪ 2, 2.

Which, compared with Hildebrands fore-alledged confession at his death; that,Here, p. 28. suadente Diabolo, he had raised up Gods wrath and hatred amongst Christians, (by his prohibiting of Priests Marriages, as well as receiving investitures from Laymens hands,) is a sufficient motive eternally to explode it.

The Glosses on Gratian resolve, Matrimonium est res sacratissima; yea the Church, Popes, Bishops, Priests of Rome have enrolled Marriage in the very list of of their 7. Sacraments, as a Sacrament and most sacred Ordinance of divine instituti∣on; by this device, they have made Popes, Bishops, Priests in their Ecclesiastical Consisto∣ries, the sole and only competent Judges of aell causes, questions concerning matrimony; which no Kings, nor other Laymen may any wayes examine or determine. Moreover they have canonized Orders for another of their Sacraments, and joyned it and Marriage to each other in the Catalogue of their Sacraments: It seems therefore very strange, irrational, contradictory, that this their Sacrament of Marriage should so defile their Popes, Bishops, Priests, and all other persons admitted to their Sacrament of Orders, as to render them utterly uncapable of executing or enjoying their Orders; That these 2. Sacraments should be so incompatible, inconsistent, adverse to each other, as to null, destroy one another; that the sole Judges, solemnizers of all Marriages between other men and women, should be only uncapable of this Sacrament of Mar∣riage, yea that it should more pollute, disable them to receive, retain, execute their Sacrament of Orders, then professed singleFornicatio simplex non est dgna depositio∣ne, quia paci sine lio vitio inveniuntur.

I shall cloze up the History of Hildebrands Papacy, with these memorable Censures of his Antichristian proceedings against the Emperor Henry the 4th, writ∣ten by learned Bishops of that age in justification and defence of the Emperors Sove∣raignty, against his New Usurpations. Valtramus Naumbergensis Episcopus shall lead the Van, who in his Notable TreatiseMat. Flacius Illyricus Cata∣logus Testium Veritatis, Ar∣gentorati, 1562 p. 212, &c. Mat. Freherus, Germaniae Scri∣ptores Franco∣furti, 1600. p. 228, &c. De Unitate Ecclesiae, (written about the year 1077.) asserts from Scripture and other Evidences, Papam non habere politi∣cum gladium, multo minus aliquod Dominium super Imperatorem; Nullo jure posse eum subditos Imperatoris, aut aliorum Dominorum, a juramento fidelitatis absolvere. Quod om∣nis anima sit subjecta superioribus potestatibus: atque ideo etiam Spirituales summos & infimos, politicis Magistratibus obedire debere. Papas & Episcopos non tantum nul∣las justas causas habere, quod Caesarem (Henricum 4.) persequantur, sed etiam in ipsa persecutione adeo modum excellere, ut plane scelerate et impie contra omnia divina et humana jura fecerant. His arguments against the Popes Supremacy from Scri∣pture, are principally these: Nolite plures Magistri fieri, fratres mei, scientes, quoni∣am magis judicium sumitis; Sicut dixitJac. 3. 1. Jacobus Apostolus. Ex doctrina Domini ac Salvatoris nostri;Mat. 23. 8. Vos, inquit, nolite vocari Rabbi: unus est enim Magister vester:Mat. 23. 11. Luke 22. 26. Qui enim, inquit Christus, major est vestrum, erit minister vester; Luke 14. 11. c. 18. 54. Qui enim se exaltaverit, humiliabitur; & qui se humiliaverit exaltabitur; Sed cum ipse unus Magister Christus, idem{que} Deus,Dan. 2. 21. muter tempora, & transferat reg∣na, Prov. 21. 1 tenens corda Regum in dextra sua; Legimus docuisse Hildebrandum Pa∣pam, quod potestatem ipse habuerit super Reges, et super regna? et posse id facere, quod per Deum tantum fieri dicit Psalmista; Psal. 75. 7. Hunc humiliet, & hunc exaltet: NamMat. 22. 21. reddite, inquit, quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari; & quae sunt Dei, Deo. Quam certe regulam proprio consirmavit exemplo, di∣cens Petro Apostolo,Mat. 17. 24, 25, 26, 27. Ut non scandalizemus eos, id est, ne nos Caesari contradi∣centes, tumultuandi eis occasionem praebeamus, vade ad mare, & mitte hamum, & eum piscem qui primus ascenderit, tolle, & aperto ore ejus invenies staterem; il∣lam

Qui utique dout Apostolos, Ecclesiam, non Regnum disponere, vel ordinare, quod nec ipe legitur affectasse,Joan. 6. 15. Qui fugit in montem solus orare, cum turbae venissent rapere eum & Regem constituere.Phil. 2. 6, 7. 8 Quoniam cum in forma Dei esset, formam servi accipiens,Mat. 20. 28. Venit ministrare, non ministrari; juxta quod etiam Pau∣lus: Apostolus,1 Cor. 9. 18. Cum liber esset ex omnibus, omnium se servum fecit, ut plures lucraceret. Unde & Gregorius Papa, cum esset Summus Pontifex, & virtutum ar∣tifex, in tantum se infra omnium humiliavit, ut prius ipse in Epistolis suis, Servus ser∣vorum Dei, se appellaverit, & hoc humilitatis nomen ad posteros quoque transmiserit, &c. (After which he subjoyns) Ecce quomodo ille Minister Diaboli (Hildebran∣dus) Ecce quomodo insanit, quomodo nos secum in foveam perditio∣nis mittere quaerit? Sic divisit Sacerdotia, quemadmodum Ecclesiam Dei, atque Rempublicam Imperii, quoniam partes inde segregavit sibi. Inter ipsum namque & inter Regem Henricum graves exortae sunt atque execrabiles dissidiae; Papa plurimum a∣nitente, ut Rex deponeretur a Regia potestate pariter et dignitate; Rege vero contra nitente, ut defenderet se ab hostium suorum circumventione, qui pro parte ejusdem Papae certant, quaerebant eum opprimere; Exinde omnia scandalorum exorta sunt genera:See here, p. 272. Exinde crevit grave & diuturnum bellum, & non solum civile, sed plus quam civile bellum, & factae sunt absque divino pa∣riter atque humano respectu, vastationes Ecclesiarum, & caedes hominum. Exinde eti∣am corruptae sunt divinae pariter et humanae Leges, sine quibus non subsistit vel Dei Ecclesia, vel Imperii Respublica: Exinde violata est fides, et publica et catholica: Exinde etiam crevit illa injustitia, ut pro veritate falsa testimonia, et pro fide catholica abundent perju∣ria, ut postquam leges bello siluere coactae, impleatur jam ista Do∣mini sententia perOse 4. 1, 2. Oseam Prophetam; Non est, inquit, veritas, & non est misericordia, et non est scientia Dei in terra; maledictum & mendacium, & homicidium & furtum inundaverunt, & sanguis sanguinem tetigit; Haec nunc a∣bundant et superabundant propter Doctrinam Hildebrandi Papae, qua divisit corpus vel Ecclesiae, vel Reipublicae. Nunquid hoc est Apostolicum esse? Et in doctrina et conversatione Catholicum esse? et Gregorium, id est, vigilantem esse? et in doctrina et conversa∣tione Catholicum esse, secundum sententiam superius propositae E∣pistolae? Atque cum tali Hildebrando partes habere, et ejusmodi qualia supradicta sunt, flagitia nutrire, fovere, vel defendere, nun∣quid hoc est,Phil 2. 14: Filios Dei esse, &1 Cor 3. . spirituales, &Phil. 3. 20. coelestes esse, juxta sen∣tentiam Scriptoris ejusdem Epistolae?

Quis in∣quam, non videt, per hunc quasi signiferum, tantum sanguinem mundi effusum esse?

Chronicon, l. 17. Gotfridus Viterbiensis writing of Hildebrands excommunication and deposition of Hen. the 4th. observes, (asChron. l. c. 35. Otto Frisingensis living in that age had done before him) Ante hunc Imperatorem, non legimus aliquem a Romano Pontifice excommunicatum, aut Imperio privatum, nisi forte illud pro excommuni∣catione reputetur, quod Philippus primus Christianus Imperator ad breve tempus à Roma∣no Pontifice, inter poenitentes legitur collocatus; aut illud quod Theodosius, ob cruen∣tam hominum caedem a liminibus Ecclesiae legitur sequestratus (to wit by St. Ambrose his admonition, to which he submitted, not by any Papal excommunication, as some Pontificians mistake.) The History of Philip, the 1. Christian Emperor, being much insisted on by Pope Hildebrand and other Romanists, to justifie the Popes usurpations in excommunicating and deposing Kings and Emperors; is thus related by Eusebius, only as a bare report or fame, not an undoubted truth, without any mention of, or relation to the Pope. Ecclesiast. Hist. lib. 6. c. 27. Centur. Magd. 11. col. 8. 144, 151. Ruffinus c. 25. Fama est istum (Christianus nam{que} erat) cum precationum in die postremae vigiliae Pas∣chalis, unà cum multitudine in Ecclesia Particeps fieri vellet, non prius ab Episcopo, qui tum Ecclesiae praerat (without naming the Church where, or Bishops name by whom this was reported to be done) permissum est intrare, quam se confessus fuisset, & inter eos qui peccatorum vinculis adhuc tenebantur astricti, locumque poenitentiam agentibus prae∣stitutum occupabant, se sua sponte (not by force of any formal Anathema, Excommuni∣cation or Interdict denounced against him) collocavisset. Episcopum{que} dixisse, eum non alia conditione, nisi istud faceret, propter multa delicta quae ab eo ferebantur admissa, (whereof theSee Grimstons Imperial Histo∣ry in the Life of Philip. ingratefull treacherous murder of his Lord and Master Gordianus the Emperor, to invade his Throne was not the least) aliquando ab ipso in Ecclesiam receptum fore. Imperatorem autem alacri animo & lubenti, Episcopo morem gessisse, & ingenuam modestiam ac religiosam piam{que} affectionem, Dei timore incitatam, reipsa decla∣rasse memorant. Moreover,Ecclesiast. Histor. l. 5. c. 25 Niceph. Calistus relates the story only as a report (aiunt, or ferunt) without informing us in what Church it was, or by what Bishop; but on∣ly indefinitely; non prius tamen in conventum fidelium accedere, intercessione & impedi∣mento ejus qui tum Ecclesiae praesuit Episcopi, permissum esse, quam confiteretur, et poeniten∣tium numero, qui ordine & loco suo segregati, disciplina certa explorabantur, aggrega∣retur; quod non aliter licere, ille diceret, nisi hoc fecisset, propter multas ejus noxas, cum Ecclesiae multitudine conventus ejus festi participem fieri. Eum vero rebus ipsis timorem divim nominis, religionemque debitam rite atque sincere declarantem, obsequentem ille esse ferunt. In the margin I find these notes annexed: Episcopalis libertatis exemplum, exemplum Principis ecclesiasticae disciplinae sese submittentis. Without one word of the Pope in the whole story. Now because Fabianus was reputed Bishop of Rome at that time,Rerum Ro∣manorum, l. 10 p. 126. Julius Philippus. Eutropius (a great advancer of the Popes authority) makes bold to assert, that he was the Bishop. Isti primi omnium Imperatorum Christiani Ro∣mae facti sunt, (though converted to the faith by Origens Letters, (not the Popes) as most record) & in die Paschae, id est, in ipsis vigiliis, cum interesse voluisset, & com∣municare mysteriis,See Grimston in the Life of Philip. a Fabiano Episcopo Romano (though neither Eusebius, Nicepho∣rus, nor others before him, averre it) non prius est permissum, nisi confiteretur peccata sua, & inter poenitentes staret; nec ullo modo copiam sibi mysteriorum futuram, nisi pri∣us per poenitentiam culpas, quae de eo ferebantur plurimae, diluisset. Then he concludes only with a, Fertur igitur libenter, quod a Sacerdote sibi imperatum fuerat, suscepisse, divinum sibi inesse metum, & fidem religionis plenissimam rebus atque operibus comprobans. Which incertain Report, how little it makes for Hildebrands excommunication or deposition of Henry the 4th, absolving his subjects from their allegiance, setting up Rudolphus in his royal throne, making him dance attendance barefooted three dayes together in frost and snow at his pallace gate, without admitting him entrance to his presence, upon his humiliation and repentance; when as the Emperor Philip was presently admitted upon his confession and repentance to the Church and Sa∣craments the very next morning, and neither excommunicated nor deposed for
murdering his predecessor and usurping his throne; (as Henry was only for defending his right of Investitures against this usurping Pope) let all indifferent Readers resolve. If any desire further satisfaction concerning the oppositions then made against Hildebrands Antimonarchical seditious, pernicious, heretical doctrines, and Apolo∣getical ples for the Emperors right, let them peruse Melchior Goldastus his Collectio Scriptorum Apologeticorum pro Henrico Quarto; adversus Criminationes Gregorii 7.

Having represented you with this large account of Pope Hildebrands Antimonar∣chical, heretical, diabolical positions and practises during his life, give me leave to mind you of one memorable fabulous prediction (whichAnno 1073. sect. 16 Cardinal Baronius very seriously insists on, thoughIn vita Greg. 7. fol. 234. Go∣belinus in Cos∣medron, aetas 6. c. 54. Onuphrius with others, stile it, inconcinna fabilla, in∣vented by nescio quis fabulator) portending them, yea his antichristian usurpation of the very Title, Soveraignty, Throne of Christ himself.

Potestas ejus a mari usque ad mare; & Psal. 71. 8. Et, dominabi∣tur a mari usque ad mare;] Strange Antichristian shamelesse blasphemy. It is now more then high time to take my farewell of Pope Hildebrands Papacy, whose Antichristian Heresies, Treasons, Schisms, Usurpations, Corruptions, trans∣migrated after his death into sundry of his immediate Successors, trained up under him, as his devoted creatures. It isChronicon Slavoum, l. 1. c. 30. Joan. Marii de Schis. & Concil. c. 7, 8, 9: Hermoldus his observation, that after Henry the 4. had deposed this Pope Hildebrand the second time, and installed Clement in his Chair: ex illa die orta schismata in Ecclesia, qualia non fuerunt in ebus antiquis: & ii quidem qui videbantur perfectiores & columae in Ecclesia Dei (in his repute, be∣ing an Hildebrandian) adhaeserunt Gregorio; caeteri, quos  Caesa∣reus agebat, sicuti sunt Wibertum, qui & Clemens.

But before he could vomit forth against the Emperor, illud animi venenum, quod odio plus quam Neroniano, in illum conceperat, veneno per suum Ministrum Subdiaconum, dum missaret in calicem injecto (as Herman. Contractus, Carsulanus, Petrus Praemonstratensit, Knyghton & alii plu∣res relate) or, as Vicelius, Volaterranus, and other Hildebrandians, qui ab Henrico Cae∣sare, vel a Clemente Pontifice id procuratum esse malitiose contingunt:) which proves, the consecrated wine, not to be really transubstantiated into Christs own natural glorified blood or body, uncapable of any poison, or at least able to allay its mortiferous quality. Platina, Martinus Polonus, Vincentius, and others write,
Eum dysenteria periisse, quod neque a suspitione data veneni alienum est: Nam & in dysenteriam, veneno petiti, interdum incidunt, corruptis ac labefactatis intesti∣nis, as Balaeus observes.

Si quis item Imperatorum, Regum, Ducum, Principum, Co∣mitum, vel cujusvis potestatis secularis, Episcopatum, vel quam∣vis aliam Ecclesiasticam dignitatem dare praesumpserit, (though they constantly did it before as their Founders or Patrons, by a Legal and (natural Right) ejusdem Sententiae vinculo se astrictum noverit; cum Trecenti & octo Patres in Niceno Concilio, omnes hujusmodi vendentes, & ementes, excommuni∣caverint; censentes, ut qui dat, & qui recipit, anathema sit; Cum hujusmodi igi∣tur Episcopis, Abbatibus, aut Clericis reliquis qui communicat, aut orat, aut ipso∣rum audit Missas, una excommunicationis sententia plectitur, qui ne Sacerdotes qui∣dem rite putari possunt. Poenitentia vero & communio a nemine nisi a Catholico suscipiatur. Quod si nullus adsit Catholicus Presbyter, rectius est sine visibili com∣munione persistere (excellent Antichristian Divinity!) & invisibiliter Domino communicare, quam eam ab haeretico sumendo, a Deo seperari. Nulla enim (ut ait 2 Cor. 6. 14 15. Apostolus) conventio Christi ad Belial, neque pars aliqua fideli cum infideli, omnis autem haereticus infidelis est. Simoniacus vero quia haereticus, idcirco infidelis; nam sacram Christi communionem quamvis visibiliter & corporaliter Catholici propter imminentes haereticos habere non possunt: dum tamen mente Christo conjuncti sunt, ejus communionem invisibiliter sumunt.

Qui juramentum contemnit, foedus spernit, pactum solvit, fidem frangit, illum despicit, per quem juravit, illi facit injuriam, cujus nomini adversarius credidit. Vivo ergo, dicit Dominus, juramentum quod sprevit, foedus quod praevaricatus est, ponam in caput ejus; Nunquid qui solvit pactum, effugiet? Non considerandum cui, sed per quem jura∣veris. Multo enim fidelior est ille, qui propter nomen Dei tibi credidit, quam tu qui occasione divinae Majestatis hosti tuo, imo jam amico moliris insidias. De Ti∣berio et Nerone non solum saevissimis tyrannis, sed impurissimis quoque monstris, praeceptum legimus,Mat.  Reddite Caesari quae Caesaris
sunt: &1 Pet. 2 Deum timete, Regem honorate,Rom: 13. 1, to 8.

Omnis enim potestas a Deo est: qui potestati resistit, divinae providentiae repugnat. Idcirco am∣bitiosi & superbi sunt, qui illud Domini Deique nostri elogium,Mat. 16. 19. Quodun{que} solveris super terram, erit & solutum in coelis: & quodcunque ligaveris super terram, erit & ligatum in coelis; perfricata fronte interpretando adulterant, suae libidini servire cogunt, et nobis, seu pueris, atque omnium rerum imperitis atu illudere student. Quasi vero nesciamus, peculiare esse sacris vatibus divinae sapienciae consultis pro capacitate auditorum, diversis nominibus idem appellare, eandem rem pro diversitate effectuum, modo propriis, modo translaticiis verbis, quod idem valet, nunc figurare, nunc simpliciter dicere, crebris similitudi∣nibus, frequentibus proverbiis atque exemplis, aptis comparationibus, et hujusmodi tanquam luminibus rem illustrare, animum atque aures, tanquam stimulis ferire, & ut sunt varia ingema, varia orationis sententiarumque supellectile homines instruere, docere, recreare, rapere, trahere, movere, oblectare. Et ut D. Aurelius Augusti∣nus docet, Veritas divina ita tradita, ita ornata, tecta, plus movet, plus delectat, plus ho∣noratur, quam si nuda absque veste prostitueretur. Nempe animus noster, quamdiu mortali carcere clausus detinetur, nolit velit, rebus fluxis, fragilibus, quae videri tangi solent, nimium addictus est. Ad aeterna & clara quae cerm, tactu sentiri ne∣queunt, ca cutit atque hebebatur, nisi igniculus ingenii hisce fomentis motus excite∣tur. Proinde, prout aeternus id quod subobscure de vinculo dixit, apud Joannem aperte, apud Matthaeum, Marcum, Lucam apertissime explicat.Joan. 20. 21, 22, 23. Pax vobis, in∣quit; sicut misit me pater, & ego vos mitto. Accipite Spiritum sanctum; quibus remise∣ritis peccata, remittuntur: & quorum retinueritis, retenta sunt. Et ut concordiam as∣sereret, & unum se verum Pastorem esse indicaret, ubi dixt siquidem,John 21. 15, 16. Amas me? pasce oves meas; id est,Mat: 28. 19, 20. Mar. 16. 15. Ite in mundum universum, praedicate Evangelium omni creaturae; atque, Data est mini omnis potestas in coelo & in terra; Ite ergo, docete omnes gentes. Hanc ob causam,Lu. 24. 27, 42, 43. aperuit discipulis mentem coelestis Doctor, ut intellige∣rent Scripturas, Mosen, Prophetas & Psalmos; Jussitque eos in nomine suo poeniten∣tiam, & remissionem peccatorum praedicare, apud omnes gentes, testesque horum esse. Has ergo ob causas Hildebrandus ambitione in praeceps abivit, cum potestatem immortalis Dei, cujus nuncius duntaxat est, sibi u∣surpavit: Ita mores, ita tempora, ita homines sunt. Male consuluisset rebus huma∣nis suprema illa Majestas, si ita gladium in manum mortalis cujusquam traderet. Quis concupiscentiae humani finem staruerit? aut quis moderaretur? Ne sapientissimus quidem aequo animo tantum onus tulerit. Non necesse habemus, ut quispiam nos doceat, quonam pacto spirituali po∣testate, vel ut verjusdicam, dispensatione atque procuratione divini peni (Oracu∣lorum enim coelestium promi atque condi duntaxat sumus) Petrus ejusque Colle∣gae usi fuerint. Clarius luce in Lib: quem de gestis Legatorum Christi Lucas Medicus scripsit, liquet, arma nostrae militiae Spiritus, non ferrum, neque ra∣pinae, caedes, homicidia, perjuria sunt. Nimirum lorica, thorar, galca, baltheus, ensis, Scutum, sunt Pax, Amor, Justitia, Spes salutis, Ve∣ritas, Sermo Dei, Fides. Quae munera divina saepius Imperator noster Christianissi∣mus ultro Hildebrando obtulit, sed ipse accipere recusavit. Then relating the Em∣perors manifold vertues, he adds, Rei militaris, juris, civilium morum, divinarum, humanarumque recum peritia, fortitudo propemodum nimia, non modo inter re∣ges excellens,Nota. sed inter illos quoque, quorum hac sola virtus fuit: Jam perpetuum pacis, pretatis, atque religionis studium, in pauperes liberalitas, majora tribuentis quam a Deo petuntur. Clementia in devictos, benignitas in amicos, erga milites benevolentia, in nullo unquam Germano Romanove tanta fuere Principe. Quod si flagitiosissimus is foret tyrannus, tamen ei obtemperandum, nequa∣quam resistendum esset. Prohibent humanae leges, decretaque Patrum adversari∣os, hostes, inimicos, accusatores, testes, atque judices esse. Augustus cum in Ita∣lia cum Hildebrando pacem facit, paucorum scelere atque perfidia Saxonia excidit; per∣fidus tyrannus qui perfidiae graves poenas reddidit, spreta religione jurejurandi, vio∣lata affinitate, necessitudine eam invasit. Nemini privato nisi ante in integrum restitu∣tus fuerit, dica scribi potest, &c. Post quam haec ita dicta factaque sunt, Gebhardus

Et Au∣thoritas illius, qui dedit potestatem ligandi et solvendi omnino dis∣picitur. Nimirum, ut cum pace omnium bonorum dixerim, haec so∣la novitas (ne dicam haereses) nedum in mundo emerserat, ut sacer∣dotes illius, qui dicit Regi Apostata, & qui regnare facit Hypocritam, propter peccata populi, docerent populum, malis Regibus nullam subjectio∣nem, et licet eis Sacramentum fidelitatis fecerit, nullam tamen de∣beri fidelitatem: nec perjuros nominari qui contra Regem sense∣rint; imo qui Regi paruerit, pro excommunicato habendum; et qui contra Regem fecerit, a noxa injustitiae et perjurio absolvendum. These were the new antichristian, antimonarchical Paradoxes by which this new Pope and Hildebrandian faction supported their party, and deluded their proselites. The Hildebrandian German Princes and Prelates hearing of Urbans advancement to the Papal chair by their confederates in Italy, Quintilburgii cum Hermanno Rege Saxonum, mense Aprili conveniunt, ad praetextum mutatae voluntatis, dictum Wezi∣lonis Moguut.

Valtramus Dei gratia id quod est, Ludovico Serenissimo Principi circumstantia ora∣tionum, semetipsum ad omnia devotissimum. Omni Regno utilis est concordia, desi∣derabilis est Justitia: Haec enim virtus, mater est probitatis, & conservatio totius honestatis: Qui autem intestina grassando dissentione, ad humani sanguinis alios ir∣ritat effusionem, profecto vir sanguinum est, atque illius particeps, qui nostrum san∣guinem sitiens semper circuit, quaerens quem devoret. Tu igitur gloriosissime Princeps, attendens, quomodo Deus pacis est, & non dissensionis: quod ex te est, pacem cum omnibus habeas; Deus charitas est, Diabolus odium. Tota Lex & Pro∣phetae, in dilectione pendent. Qui odit autem fratrem suum, homicida est, nec ha∣bet partem in Christi Regno & Dei. Hoc ipsa veritas; hoc discipulus ille veritatis protestatur, qui de pectore Dominico Evangelii profundius potatus veritatem, flumi∣nis impetu laetificat abundantius Civitatem Dei. Sed ille vas Electionis qui usque ad tertium Coelum, non secundum hominem sed per revelationem Jesu Christi Evange∣lium suum didicit, Omnis inquit, anima potestatibus sublimioribus subdita sit. Non est enim potestas nisi a Deo. Qui autem resistit potestati, Dei ordinationi resistit. Sicut amici nostri in mulierculas, & simplex vulgus somniant Regiae potestati subdi non oportere; falsum est: Ergo quod omnem animam potestati subdi oporteat. Sed nunquid veri∣tas mendacii arguenda est? An experimentum quaerant ejus qui in Apostolo loque∣batur Christus? An aemulemur Dominum? Nunquam fortiores illo sumus? fortio∣rem se confidit, qui Dei Ordinationationi resistit, quoniam non est potestas nisi a Deo: sed quod ait Propheta: Confundantur omnes qui pugnant adversum te Domi∣ne, & peribunt viri qui resistunt tibi. Radulphus, Hildebrandus, Eggebertus & innume∣ri Principes, Dei Ordinationi in Henrico Imperatore restiterunt; et ecce quasi non fuerint perierunt quia profecto necesse est malum fuisse principium, quorum finis pessimus subsequutus est. Nunc ergo, quoniam qui ex adversa sunt suis, adversum nos eminus digladiantur ratiotinationibus, vestro judicio, ubi jus, vel etiā in vestro judicio conferamus, domicilio tantum non suo usurario, sed Christi & antiq. Patrum utamur testimonio. Ac ne forte recusetur, lex hujus esto certamini, vel me in populorum transire sententiam, vel ex nostro triumpho vos Dom. nostro Imperatori lu∣cri faciamus. Attendatur & illud. Si quis aliter evangelizat, praeter quod evangelizatum est vobis, Anathema sit; hoc Anathema non de prophanae novitatis usurario, sed de tertio intonuit coelo, De istis autem qui ignorantes Dei justitiam, & quaerentes suam statue∣re, justitiae Dei non sunt subjecti; fiducialiter dixerim, maledicetur illi, & turbenedi∣ces; qui insurgunt in me confundantur, servus autem tuus laetabitur, quoniam (ut ait Dominus) sine me nihil potestis facere: nec damnas justum quum judicabitur illi; Tu quis es qui judicas alienum servum? suo Domino stat aut cadit. To this challenging Letter Ludovicuus returned a satyrical answer (written by Her∣randus Halverstadensis Episc. to whom Ludovic delivered Valtrams Letter to be perused and answered) which those who please may peruse in Dodechimus his Appendix, at or near which time Valtramus,Anno 1095. Niemburgensis Episcopus, scripsit pro Henrico 4. contra Papam librum. Pope Urban being driven out of Rome by ClementBertoldi Con∣stant. ad Herm. Chron. Append. p. 364, 365. in partibus Campaniae morabatur, & ab omnibus Catholicis debita reverentia colebatur, viz. a Constantinopolitano Im∣peratore,
& a Philippo Francorum Rege, aliisque diversorum regnorum Principi∣bus tam Ecclesiasticis, quam Secularibus, excepto Teutonicorum regno, ubi multi ex Catholicis in partem excommunicatorum, avaritia decepto, sponte sua se transtule∣runt. Romani quoque turrim Crescentii, quae eatenus Domino Papae obediebat, do∣lo captam, ducere tentaverant: Guibertum quoque haeresiarcham, quem jamdudum expulerunt, iterum Roman intrare, & sanctam Ecclesiam, suis non benedictionibus sed maledictionibus infestare, permiserunt. Whereupon, Dominus Papa Urbanus generalem Synodum Beneventi collegit, & sententiam anathematics super Gui∣bertum haeresiarcham & omnes ejus complices, Synodali judicio confirmavit. Soon after VVelpho Boiariae Dux, multos contra Henricum Imperatorem excitavit, ut ipsum novum Regem eligere decernerent, si quorundam pigritia sive malevolentia eos non impediret, because the Emperor refused to restore his Lands and Goods forecited by his Treason, in adhering to Hildebrand and Urban, nec vellet permittere ut Apostolica sedes a Guiberto haeresiarcha invasa, Urbano cononice disponeretur; notwithstand∣ing this excommunication, Multi ex Alemannia Henrico Regi reconciliati sunt, & excommunicationem sedis Apostolicae communem sibi cum Henrico facere, which they valued not at all;Anno 1093. Anno 1093. Some Monks of Hildebrands faction deser∣ted their Monasteries in Germany.Bertold. Ibid. p. 368. Nam alia veteriosa excommunicatio, quam piae memoriae Gregorius Papa, super Guibertum & ejus complices fecit, jam adeo majores in Alemannia contaminavit,Anno 1092, & 1093. ut quique religiosi se inter eos (Salva Catholica com∣munione) perduraturos desperaverint. (Anno 1092, & 1093.)Idem. p. 366, 368, 369. Bertold. Ibid. Dominus Pa∣pa Urbanus Natalem Domini in terra Sancti Petri extra Romam celebravit. Nam Gui∣bertus haeresiarcha, ita se prope domum Sancti Petri incastellavit, ut non facile absque humaui sanguinis effusione expelli inde potuit, & Urbanus nondum Romam absque armata manu intrare potuit, Guibertistis quidem & excommunicatis multum adhuc ibi praevalentibus, nec facile se absque violentia expelli permittentibus. Henricus quoque Imperator in Longobardia jam biennia morabatur, ibique circumquaque ter∣ram VVelphonis, Ital. Ducis, praeda, ferro & incendio vastare non cessabat, ut eun∣dem Ducem & ejus prudentissimam uxorem (Machtilda, Pope Hildebrands Mi∣stress) a fidelitate Sancti Petri discedere, sibique adhaerere compelleret; sed frustra; Nam Dux in sua sententia perstitit, ipsique satis viriliter restitit. This year (1093.) by the solicitation of Pope Urban, & Machtilda, Conrade the Emperors Son deserting his Father, a patre decessit, & VVelphoni Duci, reliquisque fidelibus Sancti Petri contra patrem cum suis adjuvit. Whereupon by Urbanus appointment, a Mediolanensi Archi∣episcopo & reliquis fidelibus Sancti Petri, in Regem coronatur, aunente VVelphone Duce Italiae, & Machtilda ejus charissima conjuge. Civitates quoque de Longo∣bardia, Mediolana, Cremona, Lauda, Placentia, contra Henricum in viginti annos conjuraverunt, qui omnes praedicto Duci fideliter adhaeserunt. Transitus etiam Al∣pium in Longobardiam obtinuerunt, ut fautores Henrici ad ipsum non possent profi∣cisci. Augustenses Episcopum quem Henric. illis dedit, expulerunt, ipsique sibi Catholi∣cum pastorem canonice elegerunt, qui Eporegiensem Episcopum in castello, quo transi∣tus Alpium custoditur, captivavit. Metensis Ecclesia & Tullensis & Virdunensis, ab obedi∣entia Egelberti Treverensis excommunicati, eique non amplius obedituras apertissime mandaverunt. Quorum Metensis, refutatio Episcopo, quem Henricus eis dare vo∣luit, ipsi sibi canonice pastorem eligere, eum{que} a Gebehardo Constantiensi Episcopo sedis Apostolici Legato consecrari fecere. This Popes Legat the same year held an assembly at Ulin, where VVelpho Duke of Bavaria, his own Brother Bertoldus; whom he had made Duke of Germany, with sundry Princes, Bishops, Abbots, Religious persons entred into League and Oath against the Emperor Henry, Ut ipsi Episcopo Constantiersi omni∣modo secundum statuta Canonum obediretur, & ut Duci Bertolde secundum legem Alemannorum obsecundaretur, a septimo die Decembris usque in Pascha, & a Pascha in duos annos. Hanc pacem singuli Principes qui convenerunt, tam majores quam minores juraverunt, & per potestatem suam usquequaque viritim jurare fecerunt. The next year they drew into this confederacy Duke Wilpho, France, Alsatia, and many parts of Germany, even to Hungary. These were the fruits of Hildebrands Successors and con∣federates to set up not only Subjects of all sorts against their lawful Prince, but the Son against the Father; the People against their lawfull Bishops, yea Bishops themselves against their lawfull Archbishops appointed by the Emperor, adhering faithfully to him against Urban their Anti-Pope; And not satisfied herewith.
Anno 1094.Anno 1094. They solicited and procured Praxedis the Empress to fly away from her Husband,Bertold. Ibid. p. 369. p. 370, 371. to his capital Enemies, first to Duke VVelpho and Machtilda his Wife, Qui gratanter eam susceperunt & honorabiliter tractaverunt, and then to Pope Urban; Quae se tantas tamque inauditas fornicationum spurcitias, & a tantis passam fuisse conquesta est, ut etiam apud inimicos fugam suam facilem excusaret, omnesque Catholicos ad compassionem tantarum injuriarum sibi conciliaret. Then her scandalous com∣plaints to defame the Emperor must be published in a great Synod first held at Constans by Geberhardus the Popes Legate, and spread over all Germany to alienate his Subjects from him then; in Lombardy, Italy and Rome; God in the mean time during these Re∣bellions, plagued and punished these seditious Hildebrandrians not only with intestine wars, but most grievous pestilences, famine, inundations, prodigious flyes, cater∣pillars, corrustations, earthquakes, tempests, prodigies from year to year, to bring them to repentance, recorded at large by Historians. Yet though many of the vulgar sort of people, and other persons were reclaimed, yea brought to confess and lament their sins thereby, yet the Pope, Prelates, Clergy and Ringleaders of this obdu∣rate Hildebrandian factions (all be it many of them were cut off by sudden death, to their great grief and prejudice of St. Peters cause) still proceeded impetinently in their antichristian, antimonarchical Treasons, rebellions, excommunicating their Oppo∣sites afresh in all places;Append. ad Herm. Chron. An. 1394. p. 370. and so cauterized the consciences of their own party by their unchristian Anathemaes, that their great Advocate Bertoldus Constantiensit, informs us: Magna tamen in illis partibus (viz. Boiaria, Franca, Teutonica, Alsatia) sancta ma∣ter in devitatione excommunicatorum perpessa est, quas utique vix devitare posset, si non jamdudum Dominus Papa sententiam excommunicationis quodammodo cum Apostolica authoritate temperasset. Nam multos ipso more praedecessoris sui vene∣rabilis Papae Gregorii, de excommunicatione seclusit. videlicet, viatores, rusticos, servos & ancillas, uxores & filios, quos tamen perversa voluntas eodem vinculo excommunicationis non astrixerit. This salve found out for this inconvenience, (for which Cardinal Benno and others taxed Hildebrand of Heresie) An. 1094. in Galliarum Civitate, quam Ostionem vulgaliter dicunt, congregatum est generale Concilium, a ve∣nerando Hugone Lugdunensi Archiepiscopo & see is Apostol. Legato cum Archiepisco∣pis, Episcopis & Abbatibus diversaram provinciarum 17. Cal. Novembris, in quo concilio renovata est excommunicatio in Henricum Regem, et in Guiber∣tum sedis Apost. invasorem, et in omnes eorum complices. And not content∣ed herewith: Item Rex Gallicarum Philippus excommunicatus est (as well as the Emperor, and that in his own Realm by his own Bishops in obedience to this Pope) eo quod vivente uxore sua aliam superinduxerit.In Vita Gregorii 7. Item Simoniac. haeresis, & incontinent. Sacerdotum sub excommunicatione damnata est. The like was decreed in the Council of Constans, held by the Popes Legate the same year, who prohibited the people under pain of excommunication not to resort to the Masses and divine Offices of Simonians or maried Priests, which many therupon in Alsatia refused to do. Urban not daring to reside at Rome,Anno 1095. by reason of Clements party there overpower∣ing him,Bertoldi Con∣stant. Append. p. 372, 375. celebrated the Nativity at Pisa, where Dagobertus the Bishop most studious∣ly serving him, he honored him and his See with a Pall and Title of Archbishoprick. By this Popes treachery, Henricus in Longobardia morabatur paene omni re∣gia dignitate privatus. Nam filius suus Conradus, jamdudum in Regem coronatus, se ab illo penitus separavit, et Dominae Mathildae caeterisque fideli∣bus sancti Peri, firmiter conjunctus, totum robur parerni exexcitus in Longobardia obtinuit. Dominus Papa Deo & S. Petro prosperante (whom he intities to these unnatural, prosperous Treacheries and Rebellions) jam paene ubi∣que praevaluit, & in media Longabardia, in Civitate Placantina, inter ipsos Schismaticos & contra ipsos generalem Synodum condixit, ad quam Episcopos Italiae, Burgundiae, Franciae, Alemanniae, Boiariae, aliarumque Provinciarum, Canonica et Apostolica authoritate missis Literis convocavit, (without either the Emperor or the Kings Mandates, the only lawfull antient Summoners of General, National, and Pro∣vincial Councils too, as the premises evidence) Ad quam Synodum tam innume∣rabilis multitudo confluxit, ut nequaquam in qualibet Ecclesia illius loci possit com∣prehendi. Unde & Dominus Papa extra urbem in campo illam celebrare compulsus est. In hac Synodo Praxedis Regina jamdudum ab Henrico separara (by the Popes and Mathildaes perswasion and advice, to defame her Husband) super maritum su∣um Domino Apostolico & Sanctae Synodo conquesta est, de inauditis fornicatorum
Spurcitiis quas apud maritum passa est: cujus querimoniam Dominus Papa cum Sancta Synodo satis misericorditer suscepit, eo quod ipsam tantas spurcitias non tam commi∣sisse quam invitam pertulisse pro certo cognoverit: (She and they fathering her abo∣minable Adulteries on the Emperor) Unde & de poenitentia pro hujusmodo flagitiis in∣jungenda illam clementer absolvit, quae & peccatum suum (therefore not the Em∣perors) sponte & publice confiteri non erubuit (to shame the Emperor rather than herself) Ad hanc Synodum Philippus Rex Galliarum legatum suum direxit, seque ad illum iterarripisse, sed legitimis sociis se impeditum fuisse mandavit, unde induci∣as sibi usque Pentecost. apud Dominum Papam Synodo intercedente impetravit; Domi∣nus autem Hugo Lugdunensis Archiepiscopus ad eandem Synodum vocatus, ab Officio suspenditur, eo quod ipse non venerit nec legatum cum canonica excusatione illuc pro se direxerit, [a just reward for excommunicating his Soveraign.] Now because so many were excommunicated▪ that few of their Party could be admitted to the Lords Supper, without some mitigation of the laws, they enacted amongst other things in that Synod, Ut quilibet rite ad confessionem venientibus Eucharistiam non denegemus, quos solo corpore non mente inter excommunicatos manere, nec tamen eorum Sacra∣mentis communicare, cognoscimus. They likewise condemned Priests and Deacons Marriages under the nick-name of Nicholaitans, and Investirures under the Title of Simony, in pursuance of Hildebrands Decrees, which they then ratified. Item haeresis Nicholaitarum [i.] incontinentiam Subdiaconorum, Diaconorum, & praecipue Sacerdotum, irretractabiliter damnata est, ut deinceps de officio se non intromittant, qui in illa haeresi manere non formidant, nec populus eorum officia nullo modo reci∣piat, si ipsi Nicholaitae, contra haec interdicta ministrare praesumant. In hac quoque Synodo haeresis Simoniacorum penitus damnata est, ut quicquid & in sacris ordini∣bus, & in Ecclesiasticis rebus, data & promissa pecunia acquisitum Simoniace videre∣tur, pro irrito haberetur, nullasque vires habuisse, & habere judicaretur. His ta∣men non Simonaice & nescienter a Simoniacis ordinati sunt, misericordia in servando ordine concessa est; qui vero scienter ab hujusmodi ordinati sunt, cum suis ordinato∣ribus irrecuperabiliter damnati sunt, for receiving Investitures onely from Lay∣men. Item in Guibertum haeresiarcham sedis Apostolicae invasorem, & in omnes ejus com∣plices [wherein the Emperor was principally intended] sententia anathematis Sy∣nodali judicio cum ardentibus candelis iterum promulgata est. In hac Synodo quatu∣or millia fere Clericorum & plusquam triginta millia Laicorum fuisse perhibentur. After which Conradus Rex filius Henrici, [whom the Pope had trayterously, unnatu∣rally set up in rebellion and oppostion against his Father] Domino Papae Urbano, Cremonam venienti obviam progreditur, eique stratoris officium exhibuit, quarto Idus Aprilis. Deinde fecit ei fidelitatem juramento, de vita, de membrir, & de Papatu Ro∣mano. Dominus autem Papa in filium Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae recepit illum, eique Con∣silium & adjutorium ad obtinendum regnum, & ad Coronam Imperii acquirendam, co∣ram populo firmissime promisit, salva quidem justitia illius Ecclesiae, & Statutis Apostoli∣cis, maxime de investituris in spiritualibus officiis a Laico non usurpandis. After which this Pope presumed to summon a Synod at Claremont in France by his own authority,Anno 1095. ad quam diversarum Provinciarum Episcopos,Bertold. Con∣stant. ad Herm. Append. p. 374, 375. missis literis Ca∣nonica vocatione invitavit. Whereupon, In Galliis ad Clarum montem generalis Synodus a Domino Papa in octav. Sancti Martini congregati est, in qua 13. Archie∣piscopi cum eorum Suffraganeis fuerunt, & 205. Pastorales virgae numeratae sunt. In hac Synodo Dominus Papa eadem Statuta quae in praeterita Synodo Placentina confir∣mavit, insuper & Philippum Regem Galliarum excommunicavit, eo quod propria ux∣ore dimissa, militis sui uxorem sibi in Conjugium sociavit. Philip the next year, Jam∣dudum pro adulteriis excommunicatus, tandem Domino Papae, dum adhuc in Gallia mo∣raretur, satis humiliter ad satisfactionem venit, & abjurata adultera, in gratiam re∣ceptus est, seque in servitium Domino Papae satis promptum exhibuit: This Pope encouraged by these his successfull Usurpations in France, Ibi etiam ali∣am Synodum in tertiam subsequentis Quadragesimae hebdomodam Turonis celebran∣dam denunciavit.Anno 1096. In tertia hebdomada Quadragesimae Dominus Papa Synodum cele∣bravit cum diversarum Episcopis Provinciarum, in Civitate Turonensi, ubi iterum suorum praeteritorum Statuta Conciliorum, generalis Synodi assensione roboravit;Bertold. Ibid. P. 376, 377. & non multo post Episcopum Strazburgensem, de excommunicatione resipiscentem recepit in communionem, ita tamen ut de illatis criminibus se expurgaret. In these
Synods, to weaken the power of Kings and Princes he stirred up great multitudes to cross themselves, for the holy wars, under Peter the hermi and others, though with ill success,Bertoldus, p. 374. See Abba: Uspergensis, Mat Paris, Sabellicus, Si∣meon Dunel∣mensis, Radul. de Diceto, Otto Frssingensis, Antoninus, Hermannus Schedel. and o∣thers. His temporibus maxima multitudo de Italia, & omni Gallia & Germania Hyerosolymam contra Paganos, ut liberarent Christianos ire coepit, cujus expeditionis Dom. Papa maximus author fuit. Nam & in praeteritis Synodis studiosissime omnes de hac expeditione promovere eamque eis in remissionem omnium peccatorum facien∣dam firmissime commendavit: omnes quoque qui se ad hoc iter devoverunt, signo crucis seipsos in vestibus notare fecit, quod etiam signum quibusdam, in ipsa carne notum apparuit. Unde & a quampluribus Dei ordinatione & inspiratione ipsum iter incaeptum fuisse credebatur. Nimium tamen simpliciter innumerabilis multitudo popularium iter illud arripuit, qui nullo modo se ad tale periculum praeparare no∣verunt & potuerunt. Unde et eorum non parva pars occubuit quae terram Unga∣rorum satis impudenter devastare praesumpsit, reliqui vero subsequentem multitu∣dinem Rex Vngariae terram illam intrare, non permisit, cujus etiam non minima pars ad introitum Vngariae occubuit. Non erat autem mirum quod propositum iter ad Hierusalem implere non potuerunt, qui non tali humilitate & devotione ac deberet illud iter adorti sunt. Nam et plues Apostatas in comitatu suo habuerunt, qui abjecto re∣ligionis habitu cum illis militare proposuerunt. Sed & innumerabiles foeminas se∣cum habere non timuerunt, quae naturalem habitum in virilem nefarie mutaverunt, cum quibus fornicati sunt, in quo Deum mirabiliter, sicut israeliticus populus quon∣dam, offenderunt. Unde post labores, pericula et mortes, tandem cum Vngariam non permitterentur intrare, domum macte cum magna tristitia caeperunt repeda∣re. Such was the ill successe of this holy Cheat, designed for other ends. Annalium Boiorum, l. 5. p. 469. Joannes Aventinus renders us this account of Conrades Rebellion against his Father and his proceedings against him, when incorrigible. Augustus jam ad statum pristi∣nae Majestatis, universis pacatis, Hildebrando sublato, Ʋrbano profugo rediisse vide∣batur & redierat, nisi filius suus Conradus, aemulus paternae potentiae fax & turbo novae discordiae fuisset. Is suasu Urbani & Machtyldae filiam Rogeri Normanni Siciliae reguli uxorem ducit; a Patre decessit, Italiae regnum sibi vendicat, moxque ad eum omnes inimici Augusti provolant. Augustus frustra crebro ad filium Le∣gatos mittit, sibi insidiari non desinentem, ex professo sub magna superficie pie∣tatis exercitus, proceres, milites sollicitantem, nequicquam orat, obsecrat, ne tam infandum scelus adversus genitorem (qui eum hactenus consortem Imperii successo∣rem testari perseveraverit) committat; sed surdo cecinit Augustus. Clemens tertius Vrbe a Conrado pellitur. Vrbanus restituitur; mox invi∣cem diras inferiasque dicunt. Vrbanus acta Hildebrandi tueri, Clemens rescindere pergit. Imperator quoque summa ope contra Urbanum nititur. Moveri rursus Civitas Christiana, & dissensio Civilis, quasi permistio ter∣rae erumpere coepit, scinditurque populus Christianus, pauci reperti, qui veram pie∣tatem, injustae potentiae anteponerent; partium studia, quae extincta erant, gliscunt. Neque illis modestia, neque ullus est modus contentionis; utrisque cupiditas victo∣riae haud satis moderata; multos mortales ea lues extinxit, remque Christianam pessundedit; dum alteri alteros quovis modo vincere volunt. Ʋrbanus criminan∣do Imperatorem, plebem Christianam exagitat occulte largiendo, indulgendo, polli∣citando, magis incendit, ita ipse clarus, potens factus, ex libidine sua victoria utitur, plusque sibi ac successoribus spinarum ac potentiae, quam pietatis, atque amoris com∣paravit sub titulo Christi, pro sua magnitudine amplitudineque laboravit. Namque uti paucis verum absolvam, post illa tempora quicunque concionem divi∣nam agitavere honestis nominibus, quasi jura Ecclesiae, libertatem∣que religionis defenderent, et quo Romani Episcopi authoritas maxima foret, bonum publicum simulantes pro sua quisque poten∣tia certaverunt. Imperator quidem contra haec summa ope connisus fuit: And by all possible means endeavoured to reclaim his Sonne Conrade from his Unnatural Rebellion, but could not prevail, being intoxicated by Vrban and Machtylda; whereupon,Ibidem, p: 471, 472 Is ubi filium ad sanitatem reducere non potuit, in Agrip∣pinense Colonia hybernat octavo Idus Januarii ad Aquas Granias ad Conventus Proce∣rum Imperii agendos concedit. Ibi habito eorum, quibus venire, sententiam dicere jus e∣rat, Concilio in Senatu, ita verba fecit: O fidissimi Civium; piissimique amicorum, Ro∣mani Imperii proceres, Christianaeque familiae columen, id vos oro & per Dium immorta∣lem,
per Majestatem Imperii, per salutem & dignitatem vestram, per jusjurandi religi∣onem, qua nobis & Reipub. astricti estis obtestor, ut po;itis gratia atque odio in commune consulatis, & Rempublicam capessatis; pietatem, pacem jam pridem factione atque perfidia paucorum terris depulsam, vestro labore, vestraque industria reducem stabilite; saevior tem∣pestas rursus fluctibus obruit, me in Imperium natum educatumque; quem Deus summus rerum arbiter, & vos Imperatorem rebus humanis imposuistis, non inimicus, neque hostis, sed quod falsum esse, & neminem credere percupiam, filius meus illecebris foemineis cap∣tus, quem genui, participem regni feci, successorem declaravi, contra jus Gentium, ad∣versus jus naturae et sanguinis necessitudinem, contra divinum e∣dictum, immemor beneficiorum, oblitus naturae, non solum digni∣tate, sed et vita privare conatur parentem, cui vitam, dignitatem, quicquid denique habet acceptum referre necesse est, extinguere con∣ititur, Countesse Machtylda. Dux facti foemina est: diutius quam filio placet me Deus servat, vitam quam natura mihi donat, proles mea mihi invidet. Expectare semis fata recusat. Quae sane nostrae sunt injuriae nihil ad vos. Verum nunc vestrum duce foemina occupavit regnum, vi & armis tenet. Vos in mea injuria despecti estis, vestra beneficia mihi excepta sunt, non me, sed vos contemnit. Vestra res agitur, au∣daciam hominum spectate. Non opus est malis geniis, homini ex homine plurima mala; Vni animalium, homini, ambitio honoris, avaritiae immensa cupido; nulli rerum major libido, nulli rabies acrior. Quid reliquum est, nisi ut caeteri omnes, ab hoc, quasi in loco illustri constituti, exempla sibi sumant, parricidia passim impune committant! Si ulla apud vos est memoria Conradi avi, atque Henrici parentis mei, majorumque vestrorum, nolite pati Imperium vestro sanguine atque sudore partum, per scelus et parricidia tabescere; per amplitudinem, salutemque vestram, per immortalem majorum gloriam obsecro, auferte procul in ultimas terras ex Germaniae vi∣ctrice Gentium flagitium hocce, hactenus inauditum. Defessum tot civi∣libus praeliis Orbem Romanum asserite a vitiis, scelere immanissimo Rempublicam Chri∣stianam vindicate; poenas impietatis scelerati reddant, sentiant sacrilegi impostores, Germanicam virtutem nondum a majoribus degenerasse, vos Majorum ve∣stigiis inniti decet, terrori pessimis, quibus{que} bonis patrocinio esse. Quod tum fiet si u∣no consensu filium meum minorem natu, majore ob scelera exhaeredato atque proscripto, Cae∣srem declaraveritis. Haec ubi Augustus dixit, pauci, quibus omnia alia atque sides & Respub. chariora erant, contra nitebantur, Caeteri omnes indignitate facino∣riscommoti, aequa postulare Augustum censent, ejusque▪ postulatis annuunt ex con∣silii decreto: more majorum Hainricum filium Augustum impuberem adhuc Cae∣sarem consalutant, isque se nunquam a patre defecturum solenni ritu jurat. Jamque Civile bellum, parricidialisque pugna parabatur. Imperator cum exerci∣tu in Italiam intrat, Nordmannos, Machtyldam atroci proelio superat, Castella, op∣pida, vicos, Mantuam, Florentiam obsidet, expugnat, capit. Romanos supplices obviam procedentes, datis acceptis{que} mandatis domum dimittit. Urbanus in Hispaniam aufu∣git. Eodem anno interea, dum Caesar in Italia belligeratur; Welpho Augustum Rhe∣tiae capit, populus Sacerdotes praedae fuere. Complures qui in Templum maximum confuge∣rant ab irato teste ibidem contrucidati sunt; Sigefridus Episcopus ab ara retractus in vincula conjicitur, Wigoldus Hildebrandinus, author hujusce belli, Civibus Episcopus imponitur. Postridie, licet pollutus homicidio, sacrificat. Vix sacra perpetrarat, morbo corripitur atque expirat. Circa eundum temporis tractum universi Epis∣copi, Principes, faces et antesignani civillis belli, quo septemdecim annos Respublica attrita fuit, uno anno extincti sunt. A memora∣ble judgement of God upon them for their Rebellions, Seditions, Treasons. After this, Auno 1097 Dominus Papa Vrbanus bene dispositis rebus in Gallia, post reconciliationem Regis Franciae & multa Concilia, tandem in Longobardiam cum multo triumpho & gloria repedavit.Bertoldus Constantiensis, ibid. p. 375, 376. Anno 1097. Dominus Papa tandem ad Apostolicam sedem cum magna gloria & tripudio reversus Cardinalibus gloriosissime celebravit nativi∣tatem Domini cum suis: quippe tota Romana urbe pene sibi subjugata praeter turrim Crescentii, in qua adhuc latitabant Guibertini. Domina egregia Dux et Marchionissa Machtylda, devotissima Sanctae Ecclesiae filia, ipsa pene sola cum suis complicibus Heinricum & haeresiarchum Guibertum, complicesque eorum jam septennio pruden∣tissime pugnavit, tandemque Heinricum de Longobardia satis viriliter fugavit, & ipsa recuperatis suis bonis, Deo & Sancto Petro gratias referre non destitit.
Pope Urban continued at Rome Anno 1098. maintaining wars and contests both there and in Italy with Clement his Competitor:Anno 1098, 1099. at last having manfully enough either appeased or finally conquered most of his Enemies, Anno 1099. Romae Dominus Papae generalem Synodum 150. Episcoporum & Abbatum & Clericorum innumerabilium in tertia hebdomada post Pascha collegit, in qua Synodo, confirmatis suorum antecesso∣rum statutis, etiam sententiam Anathematis super Guibertum hae∣resiarcham, et omnes ejus complices iteravit (if the many former excom∣munications of him had been valid, what need this reiteration of them?) Statuit quo∣que ibi, ne communicare praesumerent, qui concubinas haberent, nisi prius eas omnino demit∣terent. De Hierosolymitano itinere multum rogavit ut irent, & fratribus suis laborantibus sucurrerent. Our HistoriansIn vita An∣selm. & Hist. Novorum, l. 2. Eadmerus,Abbrev. Chro∣nic. col. 495.

Up∣on which account, Anselm peremptorily refused to consecrate any Bishops who re∣ceived investitures from the King, of which in due place,De Gestis Reg. Angl. An. 1099. col. 224. Simeon Dunelmensis, andIn Willielm 2. col. 994. Johannes De Brompton, who register this Constitution, render the reasons thereof given by Pope Urban, in these ensuing terms. An. 1099. Urbanus Papa 3. Ebdomada Paschae magnum Concilium tenuit Romae: In quo recisis recidendis & statutis statuendis, in adversarios sanctae Ecclesiae Ex∣communicationis sententiam in omnes laicos investitaras Ecclesiarum dan∣tes, et omnes easdem investituas de manibus illorumaccipientes, nec non omnes in officio sic dati honoris hujusmodi consecrantes, cum toto Conci∣lio Papa intorsit; Eosque Anatheniatis vinculo colligavit, qui pro Ecclesiasticis ho∣noribus Laicorum hominum homines fiunt, dicens, Nimis execrabile videri, ut manus quae in tantam eminentiam excreverant, ut quod nulli Angelorum con∣cessum est, Deum cuncta creantem, suo signaculo creent, et eundem ipsum pro redemptione, et salute totius mundi summi Dei Patris optutibus offerunt, in hanc ignorantiam detrudantur, ut ancillae fiant earum manuum quae die ac nocte obscaenis contactibus inquinantur, sive rapinis, ac injustae sanguinum effusioni addi∣ctae, commaculantur. Which blasphemous reasons being uttered, Fiat, fiat, ab om∣nibus est acclamatum, & in his Concilium consummatum. The Emperors Henry the 3. & 4. notwithstanding all Hildebrands, Urbans, and other Decrees against Simony, would not part with, but still maintained and exercised their antient Right of Investitures, in conferring Bishopricks; and the Papacy it self, ac∣cording to the forecited Decrees of Popes themselves, used by their Predecessors, as these Presidents in the eleventh Century after Christ (when Investitures were most eagerly decryed, decreed against,) will evidence, besides others which I pretermit.

Anno 1052. he promoted Henry to the Arch∣bishoprick of Ravenna after the poysoning of Humfridus. Anno 1055. he instituted Hatto Bishop of Trent, Echardus Bishop of Brixia, and Eugelbertus of Minden. Anno 1056. he ordained Gomradus Bishop of Nemets, and Hermannus Archbishop of Agrippinae. Anno 1060. he made Sigefridus Archbishop of Colen, Euchardus Bishop
of Nemeri, Otho Bishop of Maspurgh, and at the Romans petition elected, and con∣stituted the Bishop of Parma Pope in the place of Pope Nicholas then deceased. Anno 1062.

Anno 1084 he deposed Adelbero Bishop of Wirtzburgh, for adhering to the Pope against his allegiance, and placed Meginhardus in his See, who being vio∣lently dispossessed thereof by Adelbero, the Emperor again ejected this intruder and re-placed Meghardus in the Bishoprick; yea he deprived no less than 14. German Archbishops and Bishops for their rebellions against him at once, and put others in their places, by his Imperial power, as I haveHere, p. 279, 36. already evidenced. Pope Clment notwithstanding all the excommunications denounced against him by Urban, would not quit his Right to the Papacy, nor the Emperor his Preroga∣tive of conferring Bishopricks and Churches by Investitures; But on the contrary, this very year, Cardinal Benno, with others of the Emperors and Clements party, meet∣ing in a Synod of Rome, after many admonitions & summons to Urban & his schismati∣cal Party to appear before them, and renounce their seditious, turbulent, schismatical Practises, Heresies, and sophistications, denounced this ensuing sentence against them as incorrigible Schismaticks & Hereticks, and ordered all their Decrees made in their forecited Councils at Platentia, Claremont, Rome, & elswhere, to be publickly burnt as heretical; thus enrolled to posterity by Card.Histo: de v∣ta Hiltebrandi, Pont.

But Aventinus and others record, that Conradus filius Imperatoris Rex Italiae, & Romani eum Pontificem maximum faciunt, (not the Cardinals) in oppositi∣on to his Father. This Pope (Hildebrands Disciple) endeavoured not only to unitate and equall, but exceed him in antichristian Pride, Tyranny, Usurpations, Treasons, Re∣belsions against the Emperor Henry the 4th. Hic superbissimus Nebulo, (as Platina, Stella, Onuphrius, Balaeus, and others assure us) sellam Pontificam ascendere no∣iuit prius quam populus ter acclamasset: Sanctus Petrus Raynerum virum optimum elegit. Indutus deinde coccinea chlamyde? (juxta illud Apoc. 1. & mulier erat cir∣cundata purpura & coccino, &c.) thiaraque capiti ejus imposita, deducebatur a bo equo vectus in Lateranum, ubi Pontificum Sceptrum illi dabatur, ac baltheo cingeba∣tur; de quo claves septem (Saint Peter had but two at most) & totidem sigilla depen∣debant, tanquam papicae potestatis symbola, quibus jus datum esse significabat, se∣cundum septitariam Spiritus sancti gratiam, Ecclesias claudendi & aperiendi: O abo∣minatio inaudita: ita se exaltabat magnus ille Dei adversarius & Antichristus; writes Balaeus: Hoc modo (ait Functius) eques Meretrix virilem a atem fastu rexit, ut praedictum est, Apoc. 13. & 17.Ad Herman. Appendix. Bertoldus Constantiensis, who writ in that age, Anno 1100. observes: Jam multum paene ubique sententia excommunicationis caepit tepescere, ut etiam quidam religiosi, qui usque ad hoc tempus in illa causa fuerunt serventissimi a Catholicis discederent, et inter excommunicatos pro∣moveri non timerent: (The frequency and contrariety of these Papal bru∣tish, malicious sentences, making them both contemptible and execrable to most:) Sed sancta Ecclesia in obedientia circa excommunicatos nihilominus perstitit, quae post apostasiam Judae, reliquos Apostolos etiam sirnaus, cum Domino pershtisse cog∣novit. This Pope, as the Historians of that age, with Platina, Blaes, Barnes, and o∣thers observe, (to evidence himself the true Successor of Hildbrand, not of St. Peter) Totum vitae cursum in bellis gerendis ac seditionibus absolvit, hic summus in terris Satanae Vicarius. Et ne ulla in reimpusimo haberetur inferior, omnia experiebatur quae ad amplitudinem Sata∣nicae sedis pertinere videbantur: Episcopos omnes atque Abbates, a Caesare constitutos, sedibus furiose deposuit. Theodoricum, quem Cavenses Pontificem designaverant, coegit quaro ferme mense post Electi∣onem Papatum deponere, & habitum Anachoritae suscipere: Mag ilphum Romanum Civem apud Ravennates sibi arrogantem Pontificis titulum, in exilium pepulit, & auxi∣liantibus Romanis urbe ejecit. In Guibertum Antipapam, exercitum mover, Rogerii Siciliae comitis copiis & opibus adjutus, qui videns se viribus imparem esse Pas∣chali, profugit in tutiorem locum, & non multo post subitanea morte opetit gran∣daevus.

Nam Pontifices Re∣mani magis arma quam Biblia sacra tractabant, opponebant sese Imperatoribus, eosque contemptissime tractabant, articulos fidei depravabant, Sacramenta a Christo sancita pro∣phanabant, &c. Plures ad Pontificatum insidiis, armis, ac caedibus ascendebant, quam li∣bera electione, & castitas, quae etiam in honesto conjugio colitur, ex tota quasi choro sacra∣torum viroum exterminabatur. Erat denique Romanus Papa vorago pe∣cuniarum totius mundi, vi, non ratione pleraque administrans. Ista quidem huic Antistiti & aliis praesentem Ecclesiae statum nonnihil perpendentibus occasionem praebuerunt, jam evidentissimis & illustribus notis affirmandi, Antichri∣stum jam esse natum; publiceque in Ecclesia dominari, (being likewise seconded with many prodigies, at large related by Historians, hapning at this season.) Hac re divulgata Paschalis 2. vicem Antichristi Romae gerens, (conscious of his own guilt) nequaquam sibi dormendum praesumebat; sed confestim Florentiae cacto Conci∣lio Episcoporum Galliae & Italiae, Episcopum ad examen vocat. Re ipsa admodum dis∣cusia (silentium autem de argumentis ipsius altum est, nec enim visa est ex re Pontificis Ro∣mani, si rationes in vulgus sparsae, aut memoriae fuissent commendatae.) Hoc tantum asse∣runt, hominem verbis castigatum ac dimissum esse: Credibile est, verbis satis indig∣nis. And to shew himself a true Antichrist, as Dr. Barnes and others relate, Perpe∣tuum Anathema a Gregorio adversus Henricum 4. promulgatum in ca Synodo renovat et confirmat, ejusque Synodi sententiam postea in coena Domini, apud Lateranum Romae publice pronunciat. Immediately after, (as Platina, Barnes and others story) ad Guardastalum, conventis multorum Principum et Episcoporum habito, de homagiis, de feu∣dis, de Episcoporum Sacramentis Laicis antea exhibitis, exhiben∣disve, magna est habita ratio: And to reform the Clergy of France, non ita inte∣gre ut deceret vitam ducentes, Trecas Conventu habito, redactis ad laudabiliorem cultum Ecclesiis, earumque praesidibus partim pulsis, partim castigationibus emendatis, in Itaiam propere rediit, quod intellexerat omnia seditiosorum quorundam factionibus perturbari: Several persons seising upon St. Peters patrimony, and raising parties against this Paschal, who like a Martial Pontiff, encountred his Enemies in the field, obstinate resistentes expugnat, non sine magno utriusque partis incommodo; oppida quae jam defecerant, in deditionem recipit, & totum Petri patrimonium brevi pacatum reddidit. This year Conrade the Emperors sonne,Anno: 102, to 107. after 9. years revolt from, and rebellion against his Father, (wholly swayed by the Pope, and Machtylda, cui, ut quidam dicunt, sicut sanguine,Abbas Usper∣gensis, Chron.

Si quis Clericus, Abbas vel Monachus per Laicos Ecclesias obtinuerit, secundum Sanctorum Apostolorum Canones, (to wit of Urban and Hildebrand) & Antiochieni Concilii capitalium, excommunicetur. Constitutiones Sanctorum canonum sequen∣ts (of Hildebrand and Ʋrban) Statuimus, ut quicumque Clericus ab hac hora investituram Ecclesiae, vel Ecclesiasticae dignitatis de ma∣nu Laici acceperit, et qui ei manum imposuerit, gradus sui pe∣riculo subjaceat. Nullus Laicorum, Ecclesias vel Ecclesiarum bona occupat vel disponat, qui vero secus egerit ab Ecclesiae limini∣bus arceatur: ratifying all his Predecessors forecited Decrees against Investitures. Henry the Emperor having notice of the Popes intention and designes to call this Council; Habito cum Principibus colloquio, Roman se profecturum, ac Generale
Concilium circa Febr. Kalend. inibi convocaturum (according to his Imperial Priviledge to summon Councils, of which this Pope would deprive him) condirit; quatenus tam sua, quam Domini Apostolici causa canonice ventilata, Ca∣tholica inter Regnum et Sacerdotium confirmaretur unitas. Constat tamen nec ipsum juxta placitum venisse, nec nuncia dignitati Apostolicae subjectonem profitentia misisse (as he had no reason) Nec hoc latet, quod al∣terum Papam ipsi Domino Paschali superponeret (he being unduly elected without his Imperial assent, by the power and confederacy of his rebellious usur∣ping Sonne Conrade) si fieri posset, conatus sit: The ground of his absenting himself, was, his just fear of the Popes treachery and designs to dethrone or mur∣der him, to establish himself in his usurped Papal Chair. Whereupon this Pope ta∣king advantage of his absence, convententibus universis Apuliae, Campaniae, Siciliae, Tus∣caniae totiusque simul Italiae Praesulibus, Ultramontanorum autem quamplurimorum Le∣gatis (all or most of the Hildebrandian faction) Synodus magna Romae est habita; ubi praeter antiqua Patrum instituta (to wit against Investitures) more solita reveren∣ter confirmata, etiam saepedictum hujus temporis Schisma, inter prcipuas haereses computatur, ac perpetuo cum suis authoribus atque sequacibus a∣nathemate hujusmodi subscripta professione condemnatur. Anathematizo omnem haeresim, & praecipue eam, quaestatum praesentis Ecclesiae perturbat; quae docet & asserit Anathema contemnendum, & Ecclesiae ligamenta spernenda esse: (And to make sure his Title, superadded this new Oath of absolute Ca∣nonical obedience) Promitto autem obedientiam Apostolicae sedis Pontifi∣ci, Domino Paschali, ejusque successoribus, sub testimonio Christi et Ecclesiae, affirmans quod affirmat, et damnans quod damna sancta universalis Ecclesia. Ibi etiam, quam sententiam in Impe∣ratorem vel Patricium Romanum Heinricum idem Apostolicus Pas∣chalis promulgaverit, (by no Apostolical president) nos quoque inter innumeras diversarum Gentium catervas, proxima coena Domini in Ecclesia Lateranensi ab ipsius ore didicimus; Nimirum, postquam 8. Kalend. Octobris maris fluctibus Joppae traditi Romae sumus, per gratiam Christi praedicta majore hebdomada introucti. Quia, inquit, tunicam Christi scindere, id est, Ecclesiam rapinis & incendiis devastare, luxuriis, perjuriis atque homicidiis commacu∣lare non cessavit, Primo a beatae memoriaeSee Krantzii Metrop. l. 5. c. 22, 28. 29.

Gregorio Papa, deinde a sanctissimo viro Vrbano predecessore meo propter suam inobedienti∣am excommunicatus est atque condemnatus; Nos quoque in proxima Synodo nostra judicio totius Ecclesiae, perpetuo eum anathemate tradidimus. Id notum volumus omnibus, et maxime Vltramonta∣nis esse, quatenus se ab ipsius contineant iniquitate. After this Ex∣communication the Pope dispatcheth his Legates and Letters into Germany, exciting Princes and Prelates of the Hildebrandian faction to take up arms afresh, against the re-excommunicated Emperor and all his adherents. Amongst others he sent one Letter to Robert Earl of Holland, newly returned from the wars against the Sara∣cens in the holy Land, to this effect.Platina in Gregorio 7. Sabellicus Ae∣nead. 9. l. 4: 4. Morney hist. Papatus, p. 275. Hoc est legitimi militis, ut sui Regis hostes in∣stantius persequatur. Gratias ergo prudentiae tuae agimus, quod praeceptum nostrum in Ca∣meacensi parochiae executus es, id ipsum de Leodiensibus excommunicatis Pseudocleri∣cis praecipimus (who adhered faithfully to the excommunicated Emperor) Nec in hac tantum parte, sed ubique cum poteris, Henricum haereticorum ca∣put, et ejus fautores pro viribus persequaris. Nullum profecto gratius Deo sacrificium offerre poteris, quam si eum impugnes, qui se contra Deum erexit, qui Ecclesiae Dei regnum auferre co∣natur, &c. Hoc tibi et Militibus tuis in peccatorum remissionem pricipimus, &c. Hereupon the Bishop, Canons and Clergy of the Diocesse and Church of Leodium, in their own just defence writ a memorable answer to this Popes Letter, wherin they thus notably oppugned his antichristian proceedings against the Emperor, and his adherents, oppugne his pretended Supremacy, Tyranny, Blood∣thirstinesse, vindicate this Emperors cause supremacy over Popes, Prelates, prove Rome to be Babylon, and the Pope Antichrist.
Stupendo & gemendo exlao (inquit Ecclesia Leodiensis) cum Esia,In 2. V qui onus de∣ exaggerans, exclamat, sicut turbines ab Africo veniunt, de deserto ve∣nit, de terra horribili vuio dura nunciata est mihi, &c. Qui hactenus non intellige∣bat loquendo, quid sit desertum mare, nunc intelligat videndo, quid per desertum mare significetur; non solum Babylonia, sed etiam mundus & Ecclesia, &c. Ecclesia se desertam a sano praesulum consilio. Quae enim major olim confusio fuit in Babylonia, quam hodie est in Ecclesia? In Babylonia confusae sunt lingua gentium, in Ecclesia dividuntur linguae & mentes credentium. Ait Petrus in Epistola sua, Sa∣ta vos Ecclesia quae est in Babylone collecta, Hactenus interpretabar ideo voluisse Patrum per Babyloem sgare Romam, quia tunc temporis Roma confusa erat Idolo∣atria & omni spurcitia. At nunc dolor meus mihi interpretatur; quod Petrus Pro∣phtico spiritu dicens Ecclesiam in Babylone collectam, praevidit confusionem dissen∣sons, quia hodie scinditur Ecclesia, &c. Qui sint turbines ab Africo, discimus pati∣endo magis quam legendo, de terra horribili, a Romana scilicet Ecclesia, visio du∣ra nunciata est mihi; inde turbo ut tempestas venit ab Africo Romanus enim pra sul, pater omnium Ecclesiarum literas contra nos mittit Roberto Flandrensium Comiti, et earum hic exemplar interserunt. Super his literis cujus lumbi non reple∣antur dolore? Super hs me obstupefecerunt tenebrae, nec tantum pro horrore pe∣riculi, quantam pro horrenda novitate rei, quam tam lachrymabiles literae potue∣runt scribia Matre contra filas suas,1 Reg. 3 quamvis peccantes. In judicio Salomonis ex∣pressa est magnitudo materna pietatis, quoniam judicante Solomone, ut infans pro quo contendebatur, gladio divideretur maluit mater filium suum sub aliena muliere vivere,saa. 21. quam gladio judicis dividi. Dicit Esaias, Babylon dilecta mea, versa est mihi in miraculum. At ego dico, Roma dilecta mea mater, versa est mihi in miraculum. Quid enim tam mirabile,2 Sam. 24 imo quid tam miserabile? Vidit olim David Angelum Dei stantem exteno gladio super Hierusalem, nos filiae Romanae Ecclesiae, Ecce videmus Romanum presem, qui est Angelus Domini (hunc utique locum occupat,) extento gladio super Ecclesiam. Davia orabat ne populus occideretur; angelus noster por∣rigens Roberto gladium,. 21 orat ut occidamur. Unde iste gladius angelo nostro? Unus est gladius spiritus, quod est verbum Dei, &c. Est alter gladius spiritualis, quo mor∣tificatis vitus carnis emitur corona martyrii. Cum ergo duos tantum gladi∣os a Domino Apostoli habeant, unde iste tertius Apostolico gladius, quem in nos porrigit Robeto armigero suo? Forte recurrit Apostolicus ad Ezechielem Pro∣phetam, ut de manu ejus tertium arripiens gladium, vadat ad dextram, sive ad sini∣seram, caedendo bonos & malos, &c. Hic est gladius interfectionis magnae, qui me cum Ezechiel obstupescere facit; quem enim non faciat corde tabescere, quod A∣postolicus ad vivisicandum unctus, accingitur in nos tertio gladio interfectorum, &c. Si licere dicere (salva Apostolicae dignitatis reverentia) ipse nobis videtur dormi∣visse. Dormierunt cum eo omnes consiliarii ejus, quando conduxit sibi vastatorem Ecclesiarum Dei.Tit. 2. 1. Pracipit Paulus, ut verbum Episcopi sit sanum & irreprehensibile. Nos ergo nec infirmamus aut reprehendimus verbum Episcoporum Episcopi, sed quia Apostolicus non debet deviare ab Apostolo, quaerimus humiliter per singu∣la, utrum hac Apostolici verba sint per omnia gravitate Apostolicae authoritatis sana & irreprehenbilia? Ecce ut pater dilecto filio salutem mittit, & apostolicam bene∣dictonem promittit! Sed non ea illa opera indicit, quibus salutem & benedictio∣nem a Deo promereri possit, &c. Quis unquam populum Dei, quis unquam Eccle∣siam Dei impune persecutus est? (Et huc multa ex Scripturis sucris exempla adducunt.) Ecce opera justae malitiae, quibus pater filium, Papa coelestis Regis militem imbuit, per quae possit contendere ad coelestem Hierusalem, impugnando scilicet Ecclesiam Dei. Gratias, inquit, prudentiae tuae agimus, quod praeceptum nostrum in Came∣racensi parochia executus es; Qualis & quanta sit vastitas & contritio Cameracensis Ecclesiae, quis recolit sine dolore? Ego quidem silia Romanae Ecclesiae, condolebam Camerasibus pro affectu germanitatis, nunc vero audiens haec mala inferri praece∣pto Apostolicy authoritatis, jam amplius doleo, quia timeo Matri meae, ne in eam redundet illud quod Deus dicit per os Esaiae,Isay 10. 1. Vae qui condunt leges iniquas, & scriben∣tes injustitiam scripserunt, ut opprimerent in judicio pauperes, &c. Tantam Ecclesiae de∣solationem, tantam pauperum & viduarum oppressionem, tantam praedarum & rapi∣narum immanitatem, & quod his gravius est, promiscuam bonorum & malorum oc∣citionem; Haec & pejora his praecepto Apostolici facta esse quis crederet, nisi ipse suo ore prodidisset? Nos attoniti hac novitate rerum, quaerimus unde sit hoc novum exemplum, ut praedicator pacis, suo ore & alterius manu, inferat Ecclesiae bellum, &c.
Apostolici enim peccantes arguunt,2 Tim. 4 Obsecrant,Matth. 18 increpant, in omni patientia & doctrina &c. Dicit Jesus, Si peccaverit inte frater tuus, corripe illum, &c. Et hic exemplum Gregorii erga Episcopem Salonensem proferunt, Imperatorem Maximum arguentem, quod in Priscilliani sectatores vim adhiberet; Qui damnavit, inquit, accusatorem Ita∣chium pro morte haeretici, si adhuc viveret, non laudaret & istum, cujus praecepto tot occiduntur pro causa Cameracensium, &c. Idipsum de Leodiensibus excommuni∣catis pseudoclericis praecipimus, inquit, Nos vero Leodienses quare excommunicati dicimur, in uno Spiritu nos omnes, in unum corpus baptizati sumus, &c. Quando significatum est Romanae Ecclesiae quod contentiones fuerit inter nos, idipsum in Chri∣sto sapimus,1 Cor. 1. 12. idipsum dicimus, Non dicimus, Ego sum Pauli, ego Cephae, ego autem Chri∣sti; num quid pro hac unanimitate excommunicati dicimur, &c. Nobis legem Dei tenentibus objiciunt, quod transgrediamur eorum novas traditiones. At illis dicit Deus, Quare vos transgredimini mandatum Dei propter traditiones vestras? Jubet Deus,Mat. 15. 2, 3. ut quae sunt Caesaris, reddamus Caesari, & quae sunt Dei, Deo. In hanc sententi∣am Petrus & Paulus pedibus eunt.Mat. 22. 21 Petrus inquit, Deum timete, honorisicate Regem. Servi subditi estote in omni timore dominis, non tantum bonis & modestis,1 Pet. 2 17, 18 sed etiam dyscolis, &c. Qui hoc omni animae praecepit, quem a subjectione terrenae potesta∣tis excepit? Quia ergo Regem honoramus, quia Dominis nostris non ad oculum, sed in plicitate cordis servimus, ideo excommunicati dicimur? Sed Simoniaci sumus. Simo∣moniacos, quantum ad nos, vitamus, & quos vitare nequimus, pro loco & tempore toleramus, nec minus vitamus illos, qui notam avaritiae honesto nomine praetexen∣tes, quod gratis se jactant dare, vendunt sub charitatis nomine, & sicut Montanistae sub nomine oblationum artificiosius accipiunt munera; Oh dolendo miramur, quare, quando & a quo excommunicati simus. Non ab Episcopo nostro, non ab Archiepis∣copo, cui Episcopus noster suffragatur, nos excommunicatos esse scimus. Sed nec a Papa Romano nos esse excommunicatos credimus; quia scimus eum non ignorare quod ait Nicodemus,Johann. 7. Lex nostra non judicat quemquam nisi andierit ab ipso prius. Nec Sodomitas damnasset Deus,Genes. 18 nisi descendisset ad ipsos, videre, utrum clamorem, qui ve∣nerat ad eum, opere complessent. Qui nihil a nobis audivit, quem non Episcopus, non Archiepiscopus aliquando contra nos interpellavit, quis crederet quod nos excom∣municaverit? &c. Credo dicetis nos ideo haberi excommunicatos, quia favemus E∣piscopo nostro, faventibus partibus domini sui Imperatoris. In hac re sunt initia do∣lorum, pro hac re erubescunt causae malorum, quia Satanas solutus terram peram∣bulans, jam divisit regnum & Sacerdotium; Quia ergo Diabolus venit ad nos habens iram magnam,Apocal. 20 Patrem nostrumqui est in coelis oramus pro hocspecialiter, ne nos in∣ducat in tentationem hanc, sed liberet nos a malo hujus tentationis, &c. Quis jure re∣prehendet, quod Episcopus partibus Domini sui favet, cui promissam cum juramento fidelitotem debet? &c. Hoc non ignorant illi qui regnum & Sacerdotium scindentes novello schismate, et novellis traditionibus, illos qui Regi perjurant, se a culpa perjurii absolvere promittunt, &c. Hinc omnes perpendite, quis sit reus capitis, qui non reddit Caesari quae sunt Caesaris secundum Decretum Dei. vel qui Regem inhonorat contra Decretum Apostoli, vel perjuraudo as∣sumit nomen Dei in vanum, per quod juravit Regi fidelitatem. Ecce quare ex∣communicati dicimur. Sed quare pseudoclerici vocamur, qui canonice viventes, operi∣bus meremur, ut Clerici vocemur? Non est inquam de sorte Dei, (alludens ad vocem ) qui vult nos excludere a sorte Dei; (ac proinde Paschalem, qua in parte col∣locat) Evomuit cor Paschasii vile convicium,1 Pet. 5. prout vetulae & textrices faciunt. Pe∣trus Apostolus docet,Gal. 4. 19: non dominantes in Clero, sed forma facti gregis. Paulus A∣postolus, filioli quos iterum parturio in Domino; Hos igitur attendat Dominus Paschasius pios admonitores, non impios conviciatores. Maledictum excommunica∣tionis Dominus Paschasius nobis imporperat, sed illud ante omnes timemus, quod Spiritus sanctus per os Psalmistae dicit,Psal. 119. 21. Maledicti omnes qui declinant a mandatis tuis; Maledictum excommunicationis, quod ex novella traditione Hildebrandus, Odardus & iste tertius indiscrete protulerunt, omnino abjicimus, & priores Patres sanctos us∣que nunc veneramur & tenemus, qui dictante Spiritu sancto, non animi motu, in majoribus & minoribus potestatibus graviter delinquentibus, quaedam dissimulave∣runt, quaedam correxerunt, & quaedam toleraverunt. Dominus noster Episcopus communicat Regi & Imperatori suo, cui ex Regalibus ejus acceptis fidelitatem juravit Nimium effurit tempus, quo haec consuetudo incoepit, & sub hac consuetudine migraverunt a saeculo sancti et reverendi Episcopi, reddentes Caesari quae erant Caesa∣ris,
& Dio quaerant Dei. (Hicque multos ex Ambrosio & Augustino loces addu∣cunt.) Ecce, inquit, quare excommunicati vocamur, eo quod sanctos et moderatos et antiquos Patres tenemus, et pro posse imitamur. Episcopum, Archiepiscopum nostrum, provincialem & comprovincialem Synodum ex antiqua traditione tenemus; & quicquid ibi de Scripturis definitum fuerit, Romam non refertur, usque ad graviora negotia, de quibus non inventur in Scripturis sanctis authoritas. Illos ve∣ro Legatos a Latere Romani Episcopi exeuntes, & ad ditanda marsupia discurrentes, omnino refutamus,Nota, sicut temporibus Zozami, Coelestini, Bonifacii Concilia probaverunt. Etenim ut a fructibus eorū cognoscamus eos, non morum correctio, non vitae emen∣datio, sed inde hominum caedes, & Ecclesiarum Dei proveniunt depraedationes. Quia igitur antiquae regulae inhaeremus, & non omni vento doctrinae circumferimur, ecce unde excommunicati dicimur? Cur Paschasius vult, ut exolvamus quod non ra∣puimus? ut pseudoclerici vocemur, ubi rectam lineam tenemus? Potius deposito spiritu prae sumptionis, cum suis consiliariis solerter recolligat, quomodo a beato Sylvestro us{que} ad Hildebrandum sedem Romanam Papae obtinuerint, & quot et quanta inaudita exambitione illius sedis perpetrata sint, et quomodo per Reges Im∣peratores definita sint, et pseudo papae daminati et abdicati sint, et ibi plus valuit virtus Imperialis, quam excommunicatio Hildebrandi,Gal. 2. 11. Odardi, Paschasii, &c. Paulus Apostolus in faciem Petro Principi Apostolorum restitit. Ergo remoto Romanae ambitionis typo, ur de gravibus et manifestis non reprehendantur et corrigan∣tur Romani Episcopi? Qui reprehendi & corrigi non vult, pseudo est sive Episcopus, sive Clericus; Nos vero qui per misericordiam Dei, juxta regulam obedientes & corrigibiles sumus, & schisma, & simoniam, & excommunicationem per omnia dictante ratione & Spiritu sancto vitare volumus, &c. Quae etsi devastanda essent, edicto Re∣gum et Imperatorum devastari deberent, qui non sine causa gladium portant. Sed solutus est Satanas habens iram magnam, quem exterreat valida manus Dei, (ad Ec∣clesiam in Apocalypsi alludens,Apocal. 22. v. 1. & 12. quam Satan persequitur;) Nos ab excommunicatione excipiet ipsa Romanorum authoritas. Hildebrandus Papa, qui author est hujus novelli schismatis, & primus levavit Sacerdotalem lanceam contra diadema regni, primo indiscrete Henrico faventes excommunicavit, sed reprehendens se intempe∣rantiae excepit ab excommunicatione illos, qui Imperatori adhaerebant necessaria & debita subjectione, non voluntate faciendi vel conciliandi malum; Et hoc pro decreto scripsit, &c. Excutit inde amplius Paschalis ad Robertum Epistolae verba; Henricum haereticorum caput & ejus fautores persequere; nullum profecto Deo gratius sacri∣ficium offerre poteris, &c. Cum Alaricus Rex Gotthorum iret ad capiendam Romam, monitus a quodam servo Dei, ut ab his malis cessaret, non volens, inquit, vado Romam; vir enim quidam me quotidie torquens urget, ut eam ad destruendam Ro∣mam; Hoc exemplo urget Apostolicus armigerum suum, ut totum depopuletur regnum, quod non potest fieri sine caede & sanguine, & Ecclesiarum Dei depopula∣tione. Alaricus in hoc quidem mitior fuit, qui capta Roma Ecclesiis Dei pepercit; & a caede hominum abstinuit; nunc nihil excepto, immittitur Robertus ab Apostolico, ut non solum in Cameracenses & nos Leodienses, sed totus feratur ad dispergendos omnes.Isa. 52. 7. Quis clamabit modo cum Esaia, Quàm pulchri super montes pedes praedicantis & annunciantis pacem, &c.Mat. 26. 51, 52: Qualem zelum habuit Petrus in amputanda auricula Mal∣chi, talem zelum habet modo Vicarius Petri in amputanda auricula Regis haeretici; sed qui in feriendo Petrum imitatur, etiam in recondendo gladio Petrum imitetur, &c. Esto, concedimus vobis inviti eum talem esse qualem dicitis, nec talis a nobis re∣pellendus esset, armis contra eum sumptis, sed precibus ad Deum fusis. Con∣tra Pharaonem cujus cor contra Deum induravit,Exod. c. 6, &c. Moses, ranam, muscam, locustam, grandinemque induxerat; has tantum plagas non nisi orando extensis in coelum ma∣nibus, avertere potuit; Jeremias pro Nabuchodonozor, & Paulus pro Nerone orant, &c. (Et haec exempla latius exporrigit.) Quis Pontificum Romanorum suis unquam decretis authorizavit, ut debeat Pontifex gladio belli in peccantes uti?Greg. l. 7. Re∣gist. c. 1. Gregorius pri∣mus hujus nominis Papa quid omnes ante se Papae, super hoc senserint, & quid om∣nes post se sentire debeant, ostendit, scribens Sabiniano Diacono, &c. Hoc exemplo omnes a primo Gregorio contenti, utebantur solo gladio spirituali, us{que} ad ultimum Gregorium, qui primus se et suo exemplo alios Pontifices contra Imperatorem accinxit gladio belli, &c. Dicitis cum Gregorio, quoquo modo liget pastor, timeat grex vinculum pastoris; Dicimus & nos cum Gregorio, ligandi & solvendi potestate se privat, qui subjectos pro suo velle & non pro merito eorum, ligat & solvit. Di∣citis,
quoque modo excommunicatur, si morte praevenitur, damnatur. Hic no∣bis succurrit Romanae Ecclesiae authoritus; Gregorius enim primus scripto & facto exauctoravit, quod potest Romanus Pontifex absolvere excommunicatum in juste ab aliquo; Si hoc potest Romanus praesul, quis neget etiam Deum posse absolvere, si quem praesul Romanus injuste excommunicaverit? Nemo enim potest ab alio laedi, nisi prius laedatur a semetipso; nullum vero sacrificium Deo gratius offerre poterit Robertus, quam si nos persequatur; Quaero a te, O mater mea Romana Ecclesia, Num Deo placeat sacrificium, nisi sit mundum & immaculatum? Quale ergo & quomodo tam gratum est Deo hoc bellandi Sacrificium (quod non potest fieri sine macula culparum? (quod caput multis Scriptura locis explicat) Et hoc, inquit, tibi ac militibus tuis in peccatorum remissionem praecipimus; Hic quid dicam, nescio, quo me vertam, non video. Si enim utriusque legis totam bibliothecam, si omnes totius bibliothecae veteres expositores revolvam, exemplum hujus Apostolici prae∣cepti non inveniam. Solus Hildebrandus Papa ultimam manum sacris Canonibus imposuit, quem legimus praecepisse Mathildi Marchionissae in remissionem peccato∣rum suorum, ut debellaret Henricum Imperatorem (Tum{que} ex Scriptura & aliquot Gregorii locis, veram peccata remittendi rationem edisserens, qua nemp: peccatori pecca∣tum suum ob oculos ponitur, quod & confiteatur & agnoscat, indeque & ejus gravita∣tem expendat, & dolore copunctus, viva fide remedium in Christo quarat, concludit haec ipsa Leodiensis Epistola his verbis;) Hunc morem discrete ligandi & solvendi hacte∣nus tenebas, & nobis tenendum mandabas, O sancta mater Romana Ecclesia; Unde ergo haec nova authoritas per quam reis sine confessione & poenitentia offertur prae∣teritorum peccatotum immunitas & futurorum libertas? Quantam fenestram mali∣tiae patefecisti hominibus?  mater liberet Deus ab omni malo. Sit Jesus tibi osti∣um, sit ostiarius, nullus in te introeat, nisi cui ostiarius aperuerit; Te inquam, tu∣umque Praesulem liberet ab his,Mich: 3. 2. 7. qui (ut ait Micheas) seducunt populum Dei, qui mordent dentibus suis & praedicantem pacem. Et si quis non dederit in ore eorum quippiam, sanctificant super eum bellum. This Pope after Conrades death, perceiving he could not work his design to depose the Emperor (who upon Conrades long unnatural rebellion against him, had declared his Son Henry Copartner with him in and Successor to the Empire; by Decree of the German Princes) but by engaging Henry to revolt and take up arms against his Father, as Conrade had done; by his Legate and Agents; perswaded Henry (against his filial duty and express Oath, never to bear arms against his Father) suddenly to desert and raise Forces both to imprison and dethrone him. To prevent which design, Henry the Father, Anno 1103. published his intention to leave the Go∣vernment of the Empire wholly to his Son, and to take a voyage to relieve the Ho∣ly land; whereby many were encouraged to accompany him thither, and the malice of his enemies abated for the present, but he deferring his expedition, thereupon An. 1105. his Son Henry by the advice of the Pope & of some German Princes, & Pre∣lates, rebellionem adversus Patrem in Boiaria parat: most unnaturally departing privily from his Fathers side, as an Heretick excomunicated by the Pope; soon after to engage all the Hildebrandian Papal faction to side with him against his Father,Otto Frisurg.

Primo haresin (Investiturarum) anathematizans, Apostolicae sedis Pontifici debitam profittur obedien∣tiam; indeque foederatis sibi Noricis principibus, atque ab Alemannia, necnon ab Orientali Francia nonnullis Nobilibus, ad Saxones conenitur, (the old seditious Rebels) A quibus honorifice susceptus, in brevi universis Saxoniae civitasibus potitus, & ab optimatibus est dig∣nitate Regia satis honoratus. Consilio tamen atque ministerio Ruothardi Moguntini atque Gebehardi Constantiensis Episcopi (responsalium scilicet Domini Pa∣scalis Papae, being the Popes Legates and Commissioners) totam Saxoniam Ro∣manae Ecclesiae reconciliavit. After which this Usurper of his Fathers Throne by his new Imperial authority, Episcopis atque Clericis Conventum generalem in villam regiam, quae Northusam dicitur, quarto Calendas Junii indixit, ubi super Ecclesiasticae institutionis jam depravata disciplina tractaretur. Convenit igitur magnus Episcoporum Abbatum & Monachorum turba. In quo Concilio super sententiis instantibus Patrum de∣cretis primo relictis, quaecunque poterunt ad praesens laudabiliter corrigebantur; quaedam ve∣ro quae & graviora videbantur, ad Apostolicam audientiam differebantur: Simoniaca quippe haeresis Patrum consuetudine condemnata ibid. ab omnibus condemnata. Deinde (as the Century Writers observe) Investiturae jus totum Romano idolo consecrabant, et involabant plenissimis
oribus. Nam Henricus hactenus majorum authoritatem et privile∣gia contra furorem Romanorum Praesulum tutatus fuerat. Et hac quidem in parte Henrici filius Papam omnium maxime fricare studebat, sed postea in similes poenas justo Dei judicio incidit. Hoc igitur Investurae jes, quod sibi politici arrogabant, per invidiam nonnulli Scriptores, & Papae, Simoniam appellabant. His vero qui a Pseudo-Episcopis (as they deemed all who received Investitures from the Empe∣ror) fuerant consecrati, per Catholicam manus impositionem reconciliatis, proximo ejunio danda fore promittitur, to corroborate their action. This young Emperor Henry the 5th. counterfeited very much humility and ingenuity in this Council, to indear himself to the Pope, Prelates and Church. Nam cum servorum Dei conventui non nii vocatus interesse vellet, tandem in abjecto productus habitu, locoque stans editiori, omnibus juxta Principum decreta, suas leges atque jura rationabiliter renova it; si qua vero irra∣tionabilia rogabantur, mira & ultra suos annos prudenti resposione, & avita mag∣nanimitate confutavit. Christi Sacerdotibus dignam exhibens reverentiam. Inter haec obortis lacrymis, ipsum regem coeli, cunctamque militiam coeli testabatur, Se nulla regnandi cupiditate paternum sibi Regnum usurpare, ne{que} Dominum et Patrem suum a Romano deponi Imperio exoptare; imo debitam pertinaciae & inobedientiae ejus semper compassionem exhibe∣re. Sique Sancto Petro suisque Successoribus lege Christiana sub∣lici velit, sive regno cedere, sive serviliter ipsi se subesse promisit. Quod auditum omnis multitudo collandans, lachrymae simul & preces, tam pro Patris con∣versione, quam prosilii presperitate funderecaepit, voce magna Kyrieel: declamans. Eadem hora Uto Hildinisheimenis & Henricus Paderburnensis, & Fredericus Halberstaten∣sis praesules vestigiis Metropolitani prostrati, ipsius atque Regis stantis, totiusque praesentis Ecclesiae testimonio, Apostolicae se dederunt obedientiae. Quorum etiam commissa Aposto∣lico nihilominus judicio reservantur, sub Officii sui tantum suspensione. After this, Henry the Son raising an army against his Father, forcibly ejected the Bishops made by his Father, who on the contrary opposed, despised the Bishops ordained by the Son. After several bloody battles (one of them continued for three dayes) against each other, to the great effusion of Christian blood, both parties referred themselves to a Treaty of Peace in an Assembly of the German Princes and Prelates to be held at Mentz: wherein the Emperor was to purge himself from the Heresie objected a∣gainst him by the Pope, and safe conducts were mutually granted to each party to resort to that Synod without any peril either of life or body: Eo jam Henricus 4. Imperator cum iret, a filio in itinere per insidias contra sidem publicam datam, capitur, captus in communitissimum castrum obducitur, non permittitur illi ut Comitia adeat. Henricus filius praesentibus Pontificiis Legatis, Albano. Episcopo & Gebehardo Constan∣tinensi Episcopo, Comitia celebrat, patre captivo & excluso. Legati anathema a tot Pontificibus in Henricum promulgatum, renovant, & iterum confirmant, & Imperi∣um impositione manuum conferunt silio. Henricum 4. ea lege libertati restituendum esse statuunt, ut coram Legatis Pontificiis culpam suam confiteatur, satisfactionem∣que promittat, & cedat filio regnum, cum omnibus Imperialibus insigniis, corona, lancea, ceptro, globo, atque corona. The Emperor thereupon writ one memorable Letter to his Son, another to Pope Paschal, complaining of this his Treachery, Injustice, and against these inhuman proceedings, which you may peruse in his Epistles; and this to the Bishops and Nobles of the Empire.

Ubi cum ferme omnes essetis, magna pars vestrum visa est dolore contristari: sed prohdolor, nihil nobis contulit vestra tristitia, quin in nobis sibi satisfaceret volun∣tas inimicorum odiosa. Et quia consilio & rogatu filii nostri, fide & securitate vitae & honoris primum ab eo accepta, fiducialiter & desideranter Moguntiam in praesenti∣am Legati Romani & principum tenderamus, ut eorum dispositione ageremus tam de statu Ecclesiae & honore regni, quam de salute animae nostrae, ipse non est veri∣tus

Quapropter multum vos rogamus,Petitio ad or∣dines Saxon. & obnixe precamur, ut pro timore Dei & honore Regni, & honestate vestra, dignemini studere, quomodo injuria, in manibus vestris nobis illata, per vos possimus recuperare justitiam. Nos autem pro consilio vestro & aliorum, qui nos odio non habent, religiosorum virorum parati sumus, tam filio nostro, si in aliquo eum offendimus, quam alicui in regno libenter rationem dare. Praeterea sicut Domino Papae in praesentia Legati sui & vestra obedire parati fuimus, ita nunc parati sumus ei omnem debitam reverentiam & obedientiam syncero corde & devotione praesentialiter exhibere, ac tam consilio vestro quam spiritualis patris nostri,Henr.

He likewise sent another Epistle to Pope Paschal; & Regi Celtarum, thus complaining against the tyranny, treachery, injustice of the Pope & his own Son, by his instigation. Princeps clarissime,Epist.

In hac igitur persecutionis, et odii sui inflammatione, cum parum viderent se proficere, contra ipsum jus naturae laborantes, quod sine maximo cordis dolore, sine multis lacrymis dicere non va∣leo, et quia dicitur, vehementer contremisco, Filium meum, Ab∣solon inquam dilectissimum, non solum contra me armaverunt, sed etiam tanto furore armaverunt, ut inprimis contra fidem et sacra∣mentum, quod ut miles Domino juraverat, regnum meum inva∣deret, Episcopos et Abbates meos deponeret, inimicos et persecu∣tores meos sustineret: ad ultimum, quod maxime vellem taceri, aut si taceri non potest, vellem non credi, omnem affectum naturae abji∣ciens, in salutem et animam meam intenderet, nec quicquam pensi haberet, quomodo vi et fraude ad hanc periculi et ignominiae suae summam aspiraret. In hac tanta mali sui machinatione, cum essem in pace & in ali∣qua salutis meae securitate,Confluentia. in locum, qui Confluentia dicitur, in ipsis Dominici ad∣ventus sanctissimis diebus ad colloquium evocavit me, quasi de communi salute & honore filius tractaturus eum patre..

salutem animae, si pro peccatis meis flagellandus eram a Deo, de me ipse nullam conquireret maculam honori, et nomini suo, quia cul∣pae patris vindicem filium esse nulla divinae legis constituit sanctio. At ille tam pul∣chre, Subdolum in∣stitutum. imo miserrime institutus ad malitiam, quasi abominabile & execrabile scelus coe∣pit detestari. Et procidens ipsos ad pedes meos, de praeteritis coepit veniam deprecari. In reliquum ut miles Domino, ut patri filius, cum fide & veritate per omnia se mihi obauditurum promisit cum lacrymis, si modo sedi Apostolicae vellem reconciliari. Quod cum promitissime annuissem, & deliberationi suae & consilio prin∣cipum hoc tatum mancipandum promisissem, in praesenti nativitate se producturum Moguntiam, & ibi de honore & reconciliatione mea, quam fidelius posset acturum, & inde in pacem & securitatem me reducendum, promisit in ca veritate et fide, qua patrem a filio honorari, et filium a patre praecepit Deus diligi. Hac promissione, quae & gentili observanda est, securus ibam, & filius meus ali∣quantulum me praecesserat. Et ecce quidam fideles verissime me deceptum affirma∣bant et proditum sub falsa pacis & fidei sponsione. Revocatus autem silius meus, & iterum a me instantissime admonitus, sub ejusdem fidei & sacramenti obtestatione, animam suam pro anima mea fore promisit secunda vice. Cum ergo ad locum, qui Binga vocatur,Binga. pervenissem, jam existente die Veneris ante nativitatem, nu∣merus armotorum suorum jam satis augebatur, jam fraus ipsa de se detegebatur, & filius ad me,Osceleratam in silio perfidi∣m. Pater, inquit, nobis secedendum est in vicinum castellum: quia Moguntinus Episcopus in suam civitatem non admittet vos, quam diu in banno eritis. Nec vos inpacatum et irreconciliatum audio in∣gerere immicis vestris. Illic nativitatem cum honore & pace agatis, quoscunque placuerit vobis, vobiscum habeatis: ego interim quanto instantius, quanto sidelius potero, pro nobis utrisque laborabo, quia causam vestram meam existimo esse. At ego, mi inquam fili, judex et testis sermonum et sidei sit inter nos hodie De∣us, quomodo te in virum & haeredem meum produxerim, quantis tribulationibus meis honori tuo inservierim, quot & quantias inimicitias pro te habuerim & habe∣am, solus conscius es. Ille autem tertio sub ejusdem fidei & sacramenti attestatione, si ingrueret occasio periculi, caput suum pro meo capite force mihi promisit. Sic postquam clausit me in eodem castello, quo omnia animo et corde fu∣erit locutus,Henrici 4. captivitas. manifeste rei ostendit eventus.

Benedictus per omnia Deus exaltandi & humiliandi, quae voluerit rex potentissimus. Cum ergo ipso sacratissimo die nativitatis suae omnibus redemptis suis ille sanctus sanctorum puer fuisset natus, mihi soli filius ille non est datus.Contameliae & & injuria illata Nam ut taceam opprobria, injurias, minas, gladios in cervicem me∣am exertos, nisi omnia imperata facerem, praeterea famem & sitim, quam perfere∣bam ab illis, quos injuria erat videre & audire, ut etiam taceam, quod est gravius, me olim satis foelicem fuisse, illud nunquam obliviscar, illud nunquam desinam omnibus Christianis conqueri, quod illis sanctissimis diebus, sine omni Christiana communione in carcere illo fui. In illis poen itentiae & tribulationis meae diebus a filio meo missus venit ad me quidam Princeps Wigbertus, Vipertus Grol∣censis. dicens: nullum vitae meae esse consilium, nisi sine ulla contradictione omnia regni insignia redderem ex voluntate et imperio principum. At ego etsi omnis terra, quantum inhabitatur, mei regni terminus esset, nollem regnd vitam commutare: quia vellem nollem sic agendum, et sicut definitum intelligebam, coronam, sceptrum, crucem, lance∣am, gladium misi Moguntiam. Tunc communicato consilio cum inimicis meis meus filius egrediens, relictis ibidem fidelibus & amicis meis, quasi me eo adductu∣rus, sub multa frequentia armatorum suorum me abductum ad villam, quae dicitur Englizaim,Ingelheim. fecit me ad se adduci, ubi maximam inimicorum meorum multitudinem collectam inveni, nec ipsum filium caeteris mihi meliorem reperi: Et quia firmius et stabilius videbatur eis esse,Henric. 4. co∣gitur se abdi∣care imperio. si propria manu cogerent me regnum et omnia regalia exfestucare, simili modo & ipso omnes minabantur mihi, nisi omnia imperata facerem, nullum vitae meae consilium fieri posse. Tunc ego inquam, quia de sola vita mea agitur, qua nihil preciosius habeo, ut saltem vivens poenitentiam exhibeam Deo, quicquid imperatis faciam. Cumque inquirerem,
si saltem sic de vita mea certus essem,Exagitatur a legato Papa. Apostolicae sedis Legatus, qui ibidem aderat (non dico qui omnia haec audiverat) respondit, me nullo modo eripi posse, nisi publice confiterer, me injuste Hildebrand, persecutum esse, Wig∣bertum ei injuste supposuisse, et injustam persecutionem in Apostol. se∣dem et omnem Ecclesiam hactenus exercuisse. Tunc cum magna con∣tritione animi prostratus coepi per Deum, per ipsam conscientiam orare, ut locus et tempus mihi daretur, ubi in praesentia omnium Principum, cum innocens essem, vellem ex judicio omnium me expurgare, & in quo culpabi∣lem me recognoscerent, ex consilio omnium sanioris sententiae poenitentiam & sa∣tisfactionem, quo ordine juberent, quaerere, & in principibus regni de fidelibus no∣stris, quoscunq, obsides vellent, dare. At idem legatus locum et diem mihi ab∣negavit, dicens; aut tibi totum debere determinari, aut nulla spes mihi esset evadendi. In tanto tribulationis articulo, cum interrogarem, si confiterer omnia, quae imperabantur, an confessio mea, ut justum est, veniam & absolutionem conse∣queretur? Ibi legatus dixit, non esse juris sui me absolvere: Si vellem, inquit, absolvi, Romam irem satisfacere Apostolicae Sedi. Sic desolatum & spoliatum (nam & castella & patrimonia, & quicquid in regno conquisieram, eadem vi et arte sua extorrserant a me) in eadem villa reliquerunt me. In qua cum aliquo tem∣pore commoratus essem, & filius meus ex eodem fraudis suae consilio demandasset, ut ibidem eum expectarem, superveniens quorundam fidelium meorum legatio prae∣monuit, ut siquidem admonitum ibidem remanerem, fore aut in per∣petuam raperer captivitatem, aut in eodem decollarer. Quo nuncio satis tunc vitae meae diffisus, illico aufugiens, fugiendo Coloniam veni, & ibi ali∣quot diebus commoratus, posteaSee here, p. 311, 312, 313, &c.

Horum caeterorumque regni fidelium consi∣lio usus, vobis fiducialius & honestius habeo deplorare has omnes meas miserias. Fiducialius quidem propter mutua consanguinitatis & antiquae amicitiae debitum: honestius autem propter tanti regni nomen gloriosum.

Missi ergo a Principibus venerunt ad Regem, qui tunc forte con∣sistebat in corte regia Hilgelsheim, Moguntinus, Coloniensis, Wormatiersis, & pertule∣runt ad eum mandatum ex ore Principum, dicentes; Fac nobis reddi coronam, annulum et purpuram, caeteraque ad investituram Imperialem per∣tinentia, filio ejus deferenda. Illo percunctante dejectionis suae culpam, respon∣derunt dicentes; Quid quaeris ea, quae optime nosti? Meministi qualiter universa Ec∣clesia tui causa maximo schismatis errore multis jam annis laboraverit, qualiter Epis∣copatus, Abbarias, praeterea omnia Ecclesiae regimina fecisti venalia, nec fuit in con∣stituendis Episcopis ulla legitimae Electionis facultas, sed sola pe∣cuniae ratio. Pro his & aliis causis sanxit authoritas Apostolica, favitque Princi∣pum
unanimitas, Te non solum regno, verum etiam Ecclesiastica com∣munione privandum.Purgatio, cum justissima peti∣tione. Quo contra Rex ait, Dicitis quia Spirituales dignitates precio vendiderimus; Vestra quidem potestas est, tale nobis crimen impingere. Die ergo, O Moguntine, dic adjura∣tus per nomen aeterni Dei, quid exegimus, aut recegimus, quando te Moguntiae praefecimus? Tu quoque Coloniensis, per sidem te contestamur, quid nobis dedisti pro sede, cui nostra munificentia praesides? Illis fatentibus nihil pecuniae hujus rei gratia aut oblatum aut erceptum, Rex ait, Gloria Deo in excelsis, quia vel in hac parte fideles inventi sumus. Certe dignitates eae duae praestantissimae sunt, & magnum quaelium Camerae nostrae referre poterant. Porro Dominus Wormatiensis, qualis a nobis susceptus, ad quid promotus,Pisi. scilicet pietate, vel quaestu erga ipsum usi fuerimus, nec vos nec ipsum latet. Condignam ergo beneficiis nostris rependitis gratiam? Nolite quaeso, effici participes corum, qui levaverunt manus ad∣versus Dominum et Regem suum, et temeraverunt fidem, et ju∣ramentorum Sacramenta. Ecce jam defecimus, parumque nobisvitae viae restat, senio & labore confectis: sustinete modicum, & nolite gloriam nostram con∣fusione terminare. Si autem nobis cedendum omnino esse dicitis, & manet sixa sen∣tentia, praesigantur induciae, statuatur dies placiti, si Curia adjudicaverit, filio no∣stro Coronam manibus propriis resignabimus. Generalem itaque Curae audien∣tiam expetimus.Indigna Epis∣coporum pervi∣cacia. Illis e contrarioPathetica Caesaris Oratio nitentibus, & dicentibus, Se negotium pro quo missi fuerant, fortiter expleturos, Rex parumper avulsus ab eis, fidelium suo∣rum participavit consilio. Vidensque quia Legati venissent stipati malitia, & non esset locus resistendi, fecit sibi regiam exhiberi praeparaturam, qua indutus, & in sedem receptus, legatos alloquitur dicens; Haec quidem Imperialis honoris insignia mihi prestitit aeterni Regis pietas, et Principum regni electio concors. Potens autem est Deus, qui me ad hoc culmen sua dig∣natione provexit, mihi conservare quod concesserit, manus{que} vestras a coepto opere cohibere. Divino enim praesidio nos enixius inniti oportet, om∣ni scilicet militia & armis destitutos. Hactenus quidem externis bellis impliciti, sem∣per in custodiae nostrae diligentia constitumus, omnes impugnationum jacturas, pro∣pitia divinitate, partim consilio, partim virtute praelii evincentes. Hoc autem in∣testinum malum sicut nec suspectum habuimus, ita nec praecavimus. Quis enim in Orbe Christiano tantum nefas consurgere crederet, ut jurata Principi Sacramenta fidelitatis irritentur, suscitetur filius ad∣versus patrem, postremo nulla beneficiis gratia, honestati reve∣rentia exhibeatur? Certe majestas Imperatoria eam etiam er∣ga hostes honestatis disciplinam servare consuevit, ut proscri∣bendis sive damnandis, vocationum sive judiciarium remedia non negaverit, ante praemuniens quam feriens, prius invitans per gratiam,Nota: quam damnans per sententiam. At nobis con∣tra fas, vocationes et audientia negantur. Ideoque praefoca∣mur, ne audiamur. Quis tantam mentis alienationem a fidis∣simis amicis, maxime vero a Pontificibus crederet? Dominum ergo factorem Orbis vobis proponimus, ut ipsius terror vos coher∣ceat, quos pietas non revocat. Quod si nec Deum nec honestatem vestram reveremini, ecce praesentes sumus, violentiam explodere non possumus, necessarium est vim sustinere, cui refragari locus non est. Coeperunt ergo Pontifices haesitare quid agerent: Magnarum enim rerum ingressus semper sunt difficiles. Tandem Moguntinus allocutus est socios, dicens; Quousque trepidamus,Tragicus, co∣natus. O Socii? Nonne Officii nostri est Regem consecrare, cosecratum investire? Quod ergo Principum decreto impendere licet, eorundem authoritate tollere non licet? Quem me∣ritum investivimus, immeritum quare non divestiamus? (Brave Pontifical doctrine!) Statimque accepto conamine, Regem aggressi sunt,
eique coronam de capite abripuerunt. Deinde subsatum de sede, pur∣pura, caeteris{que} quae ad sacramThe Empe∣ror must not grant Investi∣tures of Bsho∣pricks; yet these Bishops mts di∣vest him of his Imprial Inve∣sttures, and Robes. investituram pertinent, funditas eru∣erunt. Tunc Rex conusione circundatus,  judicet, quia inique agitis contra . I go quidem  peccata adolescentiae meae, recipiens a Do∣mino stateram aequi ponders,  & consusionem, quantam nemo regum, qui ante me fuerunt, sustinuisse dinoscitur. Non vos tamen ideo immunes a peccatis, qui levastis manus adversus Dominum ve∣strum, et praevaricati estis jusjurandum quod jurastis. Videat Do∣minus, Caesaris exau∣ctorati in ad∣versarios dira. et ulciscatur in vos, Deus, inquam, ultionum Dominus. Non consurgatis, neque crescatis, neque prosperetur honor vester, sitque protio vestra cum co qui tradidit Christum Dominum. At illi obturantes, aures suas, perrexerunt ad filium, deserentes ei Imperialia, firman∣tesque eum in regnum. Surrexit ergo Filius adversus Patrem, et expulit eum a regno: ille fugiens a facie silii sui, pervented Ducatum, qui dcitur Linthburg, pergens & accelerans, ut evaderet manus qua rentium animam ipsius. Erat autem in regione illa Princeps nobilis, quem Caesar, adhuc sui Compos, ducatu de Linth∣burg destituerat, & alii dederat. Accidit ergo, utidem Princeps sorte venationi dedi∣tus, esset prope viam cum Caesar transiret, comitatus viris novem, animadvertitque quia fugerat a facie filii sui. Jam enim aliquid auditum fuerat. Sedensque in equo, assumptis militibus insecutus est regem velocius. Quem videns Caesar, & reputans hostem,Benevolentia in hoste. coepit metuere de vita, & exclamans voce magna coepit postulare veniam. At ille: Male, inquit, Domine, erga me meruistis, qui supplicanu quondam omnem negastis gratiam, & abstulistis nulu ducatum meum. Hoc est, ait Caesar, quod nunc luo, quia filius meus surrexit contra me, & depulsus sum ab omni honore meo: Videns ergo Princeps ille regem desolatum miseratione commotus, ait ad eum. Li∣cet quidem potestate vestra in me abusus fueritis, Deus , quia magna su∣per vos poenitudine movear. Impietas enim maxima adversum vos commissa est, ab eis maxime apud quos pius et beneficus semper extitistis, Quid ergo vobis videtur, esne vobis inter Principes aliquis relicuts? Cumque Caesar diceret se ignorare, eo quod nec dum esset tentatum, il∣le ait, Potens est Deus adhuc resarcire honorem vestrum, eo quod inique actum sit adversus vos. Facite ergo, quod suadeo, ascendite urbem hanc, & habete corporis fessi curam, mittamusque ad regiones & Civitates, tentare si possimus alicubi inveni∣re auxilium, forsitan enim non ex toto defecit Justitia a filiis hominum: Nec mora, misit circumquaque pro militibus, collegitque quasi octingentos loricatos, assump∣tumque Caesarem, perduxit in Civitatem magnam Coloniam; Colonienses vero rece∣perunt eum. Quod cum audisset filius, venit cum exercitu grandi et obsedit Coloni∣am. Cumque obsidio vehementer incresceret, Caesar timens Civitati, noctu elapsus fugit Leodium: Et convenerunt illic ad eum omnes viri constantes, & quorum cor∣da miseratio tetigerat. Perspectoque auxiliatorum numero, dimicare statuit. Quem cum silius persequeretur in manu gravi, Ille egressus est in occursum ejus ad aquas Mosanas, Rogavitque Principes, & omne robur exercitus sui, dicens, Si fortissimus Deus nos hodie adjuverit in Praelio, factique fuerimus in conflictu superiores, serva∣te mihi filium meum, & nolite interficere eum. Commissum est ergo Praelium, & praevalens Pater fugavit filium trans Pontem, multique illic occisi gladio, plures a∣quis praefocati sunt. Rursus instauratum est praelium, & Caesar senior victus, con∣clusus, comprehensus est. Quantas autem contumelias, quanta opprobria vir iste magnificus in illis diebus pertulerit, sicut relatu difficile, ita auditu lamentabile est. Insultabant ei amici, illudebant illi nihilominus inimici. Denique, ut aiunt, pau∣perculus quidam, sed literatus, coram omnibus adorsus est eum, dicens; Inveterate dierum malorum, nunc venerunt peccata tua quae prius operaberis; judicans judicia injusta, opprimens justum, & dimittens noxium.In imitation of King David, 2 Sam. 16, 5. to 14. Cui cum astantes irascerentur vi∣ri scilicet sensati; Caesar compescuit eos dicens, Nolite quaeso, irasci in eum. Ecce filius meus, qui egressus est de utero meo quaerat animam meam, quanto magis alie∣nus: sinite eum ut maledicat quia voluntas Dei est. Erat autem illic Episcopus Spi∣rensis Caesari quondam dilectissimus, nam & templum ingens Dei genetrici apud Spi∣ram construxerat. Praeterea Civitatem & Episcopum decenter promoverat. Dixit ergo Caesar ad amicum suum Episcopum de Spira; Ecce destitutus regno, decidi a spe, nihilque mihi melius est quam renunciare militiae! Da ergo mihi Praebendam apud
Spiram, ut sim famulus Dominae meae Dei genitricis, cui devotus semper exstiti; Novi enim literas, & possum adhuc subservire choro. Ad quem ille; Per matrem, inquit Domini, non faciam tibi quod petis. Tunc Caesar suspirans & illachrymans ad circumstantes ait,In Job 19. 21, 22. Miseremini mei, miseremini mei vos saltem amici mei, quia manus Domini titegit me. Mortuus est autem eo tempore Leodii, stetitque corpus ejus in∣humatum in Capella quadam deserta quinque annis. Tanta enim severtitate Dominus Papa, et caeteri adversarii ejus in ipsum ulti sunt, ut mortuum vel humari non sinerent.Saxoniae, l. 5. c. 24. Krantzius, and others adde, Caa∣ber ejus jam Christianae sepulturae traditum in monasterio, jubetur extrahi, et in locum poni non consecratum; ubi post quinque annos reconciliatum, Spiram perducitur. Mirum et incomparabile re∣rum humanarum spectaculum et exemplum non vulgar, in quo con∣templari possint ima at{que} summa. O Magna Dei judicia quae completa sunt in tam praepotenti viro! sperandum autem quod caminus ille tribulationis decoxe∣rit in eo scoriam, tulerit rubiginem:1 Cor. 11. 32. quoties enim in praesenti judicamur, a Domino corripimur, ut non cum hoc mundo damnemur. Fuit autem Ecclesiis admodum bo∣nus, his videlicet quas sibi fideles persensit. Porro Romanum Antistitem Gregorium & caeteros insidiatores honoris sui sicut infestos habuit, ita etiam infestare studuit. Impulit eum ad hoc, ut multi dicunt, gravis necessitas, Quis enim vel minimam honoris sui jacturam aequanimiter ferat? Legimus autem quia multi peccaverunt, qui∣bus tamen subventum est poenitentiae remedio. Certe David peccans & poenitens Rex & Propheta permansit. Rex autem Henricus ad vestigia Apostolorum jacens, orans ac poenitens gratis, pessundatus est, nec invenit tempore gratiae quod ille obtinu∣it duro legis tempore. Sed disputaverint de his qui scierint vel ausi suerint; Vnum hoc scire licet,Nota. quia Romana sedes adhuc hodie luit factum illud; a tem∣pore enim illo quotquot regnant de stirpe illa omnibus modis nitun∣tur humiliare Ecclesias, ne resumant vires consurgendi adversus Reges, nec inferre quae intulerunt patribus eorum. Regnavit au∣tem Henricus junior pro Patre suo, fuit{que} Concordia inter Regnum et Sacerdotium, sed non multo tempore, nam nec ipse prospera∣tus est in omni vita sua, irretitus similiter ut Pater ejus a sede A∣postolica. De quibus suo loco dicendum est. A Just punishment of God for his Wars and Rebellions against his Father to gratifie the Pope. The transcendent Tyranny of this Pope towards this pious Emperor, both in his life and after his death, (which wasAnonymus Historia de vi∣ta Hen. 4. Cae∣saris: where his Virtues are at large set forth and vin∣dicated against all his Enemies calumnies. much lamented by all good men,) made Rodolphus Gualther andAnonymus Historia de vi∣ta Hen. 4. Cae∣saris: where his Virtues are at large set forth and vin∣dicated against all his Enemies calumnies. Balaeus passe this further censure thereon. Et haec quidem non alicujus barbari tyranni jussu, non Phalaridis alicujus instinctu, sed sanctissimi Patris consilio si∣nt. Gaudete nunc Caligulae, exultate Nerones, & quotquot unquam crudelitatis nomi∣ne fuistis celebres. Habetis enim qui dum vos longo post se reliquit spatio, infamia & diri nominis memoria liberat; Romanum videlicet Pontificem, qui in Patris viscera Filii gladium stringi praecepit. Sic Regem honorabat, 1 Petri 2. Sic Dei institutis obedivit Ro∣manorum 13. superbissimus Antichristus. But now observe the signal Judgement of God upon this Treacherous Pope, who instigated this new Emperor most unduti∣fully to imprison and depose his own Father, whom he kept 5. years from Christian burial. This Pope, Anno 1106. by another Synod at Guardastal, making Decrees against Bishops homages to the Emperor and other Princes for their Temporalties, against receiving Investitures from them, and refusing to consecrate those Bishops who received Investitures from this Emperor; (the chief ground of the quarrel against Henry the 4th. his Father) He therewith exasperated, upon this affront,Platina, Stl∣la, Balaeus. Barnes in Pas∣chale 2. imprisons his ghostly Father in Rome it self. Ab eodem Imp. post pedum oscula capitur, et in Car∣cerem traditur; nec inde educitur, donec omnes confirmaret, in∣vestiendi jus Carolo magno datum, diplomate restitueret, atque ip∣sum Imperatorem confirmaret. Dum in Cathedra (inquit Massaeus) post Missam se contineret Pontifex, ecce Milites clamantes, Reddi∣te quae sunt Caesaris Caesari: tam ipsum quam totum Clerum in∣vaserunt, et abduxerunt, exuerunt que vestibus adeo nudos, ut ne femoralia reliquerint eis, at{que} ita spoliatos apud montem Soractim
custodiae manciparunt. Videres ergo Cardinales funibus in colla missis nudos trahi, vinctis post terga manibus. So little did this New Emperor or his Souldiers value his Papal or his Cardinals authority, holinesse, when put in competition with the antient Rights of the Imperial Crown, even in this case of Investitures, for defence where of his Father was so frequently excommunicated, de∣prived. I shall recite the story more at large out ofHermoldus Chron. Slavo∣rum. l. 1. c 60. Hermoldus,Krantzii Saxoniae, l. 5. c. 30, 31, 32, 33. Krantzis, Abbas Us∣pergens. Chron. 1011, 1119. Abbas Uspergensis &Cent. Magd. 12. c. 9. De Synodis, Bans in Paschali 2. Morney Hist. Paps p. . &c. others. King Henry the 4. being dead and thus trampled up∣on by the Pope, and his Son intangled in Wars in Germany, this Pope thinking he had now obtained a full conquest in case of Investitures, Synodalibus comitiis non minus dat operam Pontificiam authoritatem augere, quam Henricus Imperium armis; apud Trecas enim congregato Concilio contentionem de dandis Episcopatibus resuscitat, propter quam Hildebrando cum Henrico inimicitiae intercesserunt, quae fuerunt maximae cladis occasio in Germania. Episcopos namque non ineuntes secum grati∣am & obedientiam pollicentes in eo Concilio dejecit, substituitque alios: Statuitque neminem ex Laicis debere dare Ecclesiasticas dignitates. Henricus audiens fale Decretum in Synodo promulgatum, Moguntiae Concilium habuit, unde misit suos Legatos ad Pontificem, postulaturos ne se ex jure spoliaret quod olim Caro∣rolo datum esset, et suis omnibus in imperio successoribus. Ponti∣fex inducias petiit super ea quaestione, donec Henricus Romam ve∣niret, dicens, Sibi non esse integrum in alieno regno de tantis re∣bus aliquid definire. Henricus 5. rebus in Germania pacatis, Anno Dom. 1111. in Italiam ire decrevit, ingredituriter. In Italiam cum venisset, intellexit Paschali Pontifici suum adventum esse ingratum, eumque in se gerere hostilem animum quod pro suo arbitrio Ecclesias & Episcopatus demandasset iis qui sibi placuissent. Rex ergo Henricus Sutrium subsistit, nec putavit propius accedere ad Pontificem si∣bi tutum esse, & missis legatis, tuta fide, ut liceat Romam adire postulat. Pontifex dat Regi potestatem tuto veniendi Romam, & testatur se promptum, cum ad consecratio∣nem, tum ad omnem honorem Regium augendum, ea tamen lege ut Rex Ecclesiae suam libertatem relinquat, in qua tum fuit; & pollicetur, se pacato agmine ingressu∣rum urbem. His omnibus utrinque per Legatos compositis, populo Rom. annuente, Henricus Roman movet, advenienti populus & Clerus fit obviam, Sacerdotalibus in∣fulis, et Sanctorum reliquiis ornati. Leoninam urbem ingreditur, deduciturque in basilicam Petri, in cujus gradu Paschali Pontifici pedes deosculatur. Henricus positis in statione suis militibus ad dextram Pontificis, Basilicum ingreditur cum Pon∣tifice; Oratione autem facta, rogavit, ut Paschalis Episcopos confirmaret a se institutos; Paschali recusante id facere, totus Dies disceptatio∣ne firme absumptus est. Rex videns, se pace et jure non posse tu∣eri suam potestatem in instituendis Episcopis, quam quasi per ma∣nus omnes Imperatores a Carolo Magno, plusquam per Trecen∣tos Annos acceperant, Milites a statione (dato signo) vocat, ca∣pitque Pontificem cum Cardinalibus, jubet eos in sua Castra per∣duci, et custodiri, in munitissimo monte S. Sylvestri, donec conce∣derent Imperatori suo proprio jure de instituendis Episcopis libere uti The Romans thereupon fly to their arms, assault the Emperors Army early in the morning, and after an whole dayes fight are vanquished. At last the Pope made Peace, and this agreement with the Emperor; which was to be ratified by these mutual Oathes, & hoc est Juramentum Regis.Simeon Du∣nelmensis de Gestis Regum Anglorum, p. 232, 233, 234, 235, 236.

This Oath the Empe∣ror refused to take at his Coronation, as new and unreasonable, dicens,Hermoldus Chron. Sclavo∣rum, l. 1. c. 40. Impera∣torem nemini jurare debet, cum juramentorum Sacramenta ab omnibus sunt sibi exhibenda: requiring the Pope to ratifie all the antient Rights belonging to the Emperor; whereupon they came to this second Agreement ratified by the Popes Charter, and his and the Cardinals Oaths and Subscriptions. Dominus Papa Paschalis secundus concedet Domino Regi Henrico et Regno ejus, et privilegio suo sub anathemate confirmabit et corroborabit, Episcopo vel Abbate libere electo sine Symonia assen∣su Regis, quod Dom. Rex eum cum anulo et virga investiat. Epis∣copus autem vel Abbas a Rege investitus libere accipiat consecratio∣nem ab Episcopo ad quem pertinuerit. Si quis vero a Clero et po∣pulo eligatur, nisi a Rege investiatur, a nemine consecretur; et Ar∣chiepiscopi et Episcopi libertatem habeant consecrandi a Rege inve∣stitos. Super his etiam Dominus Papa Paschalis non inquieta∣bit Regem Henricum, nec ejus Regnum et Imperium. (A necessary Clause, since he and his Predecessors had so much disturbed them during his Fathers reign, and armed him against him.) Hoc Sacramentum est ex parte Papae. Dominus Papa Paschalis non inquietabit Dominum Regem Henricum,Nota. nec ejus Imperium vel regnum de investitura Episcopa∣tuum, vel Abbatiarum, neque de injuria sibi illata et suis, neque aliquod malum reddet sibi vel alicui personae pro hac causa, et peni∣tus in personam Regis Henrici nunquam Anathema ponet, nec re∣manebit in Domino Papa, quin coronet eum sicut in ordine continetur, et regnum et imperium officii sui auxilio eum tenere adjuvabit pro posse suo, et hoc adimplebit Dominus Papa sine fraude et malo in∣genio. Haec sunt nomina illorum Episcoporum et Cardinalium qui praecepto Domini Papae Paschalis secundi Privilegium et Amiciti∣am Sacramento confirmaverunt Domino Imperatori Henrico. Petrus Portuensis Episcopus, Centius Sabinensis Episcopus, Rodbertus Cardinalis Sancti Eusebii, Bonifacius Cardinalis Sancti Marci, Anastatius Cardinalis Sancti Clementis, Gregorius Cardinalis Sancti Chrisogoni, Johannes Cardinalis Sanctae Potentianae, Risus Cardinalis Sanctorum Apostolorum Petri & Pauli. Item Gregorius Sancti Laurentii, Reinerus Cardinalis Sanctorum Marcellini & Petri, Vitalis Cardina∣lis Sanctae Balbinae, Duizo Cardinalis Sancti Martini, Teobaldus Cardinalis Sancti Johannis & Pauli, Johannes Diaconus Sanctae Mariae in Schola Graeca. Istud est Privilegium Domini Papae quod fecit Imperatori de Investituris Episco∣patuum. Paschalis Episcopus Servus servorum Dei, Charissimo in Christo filio Henrico Glorioso Teutonicorum Regi, & per Dei operis gratiam Romanorum Imperatori Augusto, salutem & Apostolicam benedictionem; Regnum vestrum Sanctae Roma∣nae Ecclesiae singulariter cohaerere dispositio divina constituit. Praedecessores vestri probitatis cum prudentiae amplioris gratia Romanae Urbis Coronam & imperium con∣secuti sunt. Ad cujus videlicet Coronae & Imperii dignitatem, tuam quoque perso∣nam fili Charissime Henrice per Sacerdoti nostri ministerium Divina Majestas pro∣vexit. Illam igitur dignitatis Praerogativam quam Praedecessores nostri ve∣stris Praedecessoribus Catholicis Imperatoribus concesserunt, et privilegiorum paginis confirmaverunt, nos quoque dilectioni tuae concedimus, et praesentis privilegii pagina confirmamus, Vt reg∣ni tut Episcopis vel Abbatibus libere, praeter violentiam et symoni∣am, electis, investituram virgae et anuli conferas; post investitutio∣nem vero canonice consecrationem accipiat ab Episcopo ad quem
pertinuerit. Siquis autem a Clero et populo praeter tuum assen∣sum, electus fuerit, nisi a te investiatur, a nemine consecretur. Sa∣ne Episcopi vel Archiepiscopi libertatem habeant a te investitos E∣piscopos vel Abbates Canonice consecrandi. Praedecessores enim vestri Ecclesias regni sui tantis regalium suorum beneficiis am∣pliarunt ut regnum ipsorum Episcoporum maxime vel Abbatum praesidiis oporteat communiri, et populares dissensiones quae in electi∣onibus saepe contingant, regali oporteat Majestate compesci. Quamobrem prudentiae et potestativae curae debes sollicitius immi∣nere ut Romanae Ecclesiae celsitudo, et caeterarum salus praestante Domino beneficiis et servitiis conservetur. Si qua igitur Ecclesia∣stica vel Secularis persona hanc nostrae concessionis paginam teme∣rario ausu pervertere temptaverit, anathematis vinculo, nisi resipue∣rit innodetur, honoris quoque ac dignitatis suae periculum patiatur. Observantes autem misericordia divina custodiat, et personam pote∣statemque tuam ad honorem suum, et gloriam foeliciter, imperare concedat. His conventionibus & juramentis inter Dominum Papam & Imperatorem in Pas∣chali festivitate facta est Concordia; Deinde Romam Idus Aprilis Imperator venit: quem Papa in Ecclesia Sancti Petri missam celebrans, Imperatorem consecravit, & ei omnibusque suis absolutionem fecit, & omnem injuriam sibi factam condonavit. The Emperor being thus solemnly Crowned, and receiving this Charter concern∣ing Investitures, and Oath from the Pope and Cardinals, not long after departed out of Italy with his forces, being conducted by the Pope, Cardinals, Prelates, with all pos∣sible professions & expressions of future loyalty and affection to him. No sooner were the Emperor and his forces departed out of Italy, but this most perfidious ambitious Pope upon this occasion, summoned a Council at Rome on purpose to null and abro∣gate all these his Concessions and Oath to the Emperor, as made by mere duresse, and constraint, thus related by theSimeon Du∣nelmensis.

(though tatifyed by this and other forecited Popes.)
Perlecta vero hac Charta, acclamatum est ab universo Concilio Amen, A∣men, Fiat, Fiat. (O the Punick faith, perjury, treachery of this Pope, his Cardi∣nals, and Prelates, thus to repeal what they so solemnly ratified by their Oathes, Charters, in Gods own presence but few Moneths before to the Emperor, as his undoubted right!) Archiepiscopi qui cum suis Suffraganeis interfuerunt, hii sunt, Jo∣hannes Patriarcha Veneticus, Senes Capuanus, Laudulfus Beneventanus, Almaphi∣tanus, Regitanus, Hidrontinus, Brundulfinus, Capsanus, Girontinus & Graeci, Ro∣sanus, & Archiepiscopus Sanctae Severinae; Episcopi quoque, Petrus Portuensis, Leo Hostiens, Cono Praenestinus, Gerardus Engolisinus, Galo Leonensis, Legatus pro Bturicensi & Viennensi Archiepiscopis, Rogerus Wulturensis, Gaufridus Se∣nensis, Rollandus Populiensis, Gregorius Terracinensis, VVillielmus Trojanus, Gibinus Siracusanus, Legatus pro omnibus Siculis, & alii fere C.

Upon this occasion there arose new Quarrels and contests between the Emperor and Pope about Investitures; the Bishops, and Churches adhering to the Emperor asserting, maintaining this his antient Right against Pope Paschal and his perjured Confederates Amongst others, Waltramus Bishop of Naumberg writ a particular Treatise, De Episcoporum Investitura per Imperatores facienda; Which being very rare and pertinent to my Theam, in respect of the great controversies about Investitures then arising not only in Germany, but also in England between Anselm and our Kings, I shall here insert. Flacii Illyrici Catalog. Testi∣um Veritatis, Appendix. p. 54, 55, 56, 57, 58. Leo Constantini filius, imperavit annis quinque in regno Graecorum & Romano∣rum. Post quem uxor ejus Hyrene, filia Caiani Avarum, id est, Hunnorum Regis, cum filio suo Constantino imperavit annis decem: verum Constantinus matrem suam Hyrenen imperio privavit, solusque annis sex imperavit. Hyrene autem super ere∣pto sibi imperio, foemineo dolore abusa, Constatinum filium suum oculis & imperio privavit, & sola annis sex imperavit.Not Pope Leo. Romani autem, qui ab Imperatore Con∣stantinopolitano jam animo desciverant, propter tardum & infructuosum illius auxi∣lium contra Tyrannos, accepta occasionis opportunitate, quia mulier, excaecato Imperatore Constantino filio suo, imperabat, uno omnium consensu Carolo Magno Imperatoris laudes acclamaverunt, eumque per manus Leonis Papae coronaverunt, Caesarem & Augustum appellantes. Igitur ex quo Byzantium Thraciae Civitas, a primo Constantino in novam amplificata, & in regiam urbem est exaltata, evolutis annis circiter CCCCLXVIII, diviso a Constantinopoli Romano imperio, Carolus Magnus Rex Francorum primus imperavit Romanis annos XIII. Ex tunc a Graecis in Reges rancorum translata est Imperatoria dignitas: & Adrianus Papa, collaudan∣tibus Romanis & plena Synodo Primatum, Archiepiscoporum, Episcoporum, Abbatum, Ducum & Principum acclamatione; Carolo Magno, ejusque successoribus futuris Imp. sub anathemate concessit Patriciatum Romanum: & per se vel per nuncios confir∣mationem in electione, et in consecratione Romani Pontif concessit, et inve∣stituras Episcoporum eis determinavit, ut non consecretur Episcopus qui per Regem et Imp non introiret pure et integre: exceptis quos Papa Romanus investire et consecrare debet ex antiquo dono Regum et Imperat. cum aliis quae vocantur Regalia, id est a Regibus et Imperato∣ribus Pontif. Romanis data, in fundis; et redditibus. In hac concessione continentur regales Abbatiae, Praepositurae. Ex hoc constituto, Ca∣rolus Magnus, Aistulfum, Desiderium, aliosque Reges & tyrannos, bello, caede & exilio delevit, qui fundos & bona Ecclesiae Romanae, aliarumque Ecclesiarum in∣vaserant, omnia reddens libertari. Alii Reges et Imperatores, successores Caroli Magni, defensionem Romanae Ecclesiae, et aliarum Eccle∣siarum timore Dei et charitate devote prosequuti sunt, investitu∣ras Episcoporum facientes, eorum consecrationibus per se & nuncios suos asistentes, juxta quod Paulus Apostolus ait ad1 Cor. 15, 6. Corinthios: Non quod primum spiritu∣ale, sed quod animale, diende spirituale. Magnus etiam Gregorius, Theodorico & Theo∣deberto, & Brummihildi scribit, ut absque Symonia investituras Episcoporum faciant. Hic etiam primus Gregorius non est consecratus, donec Mauritii Imperatoris interfuit assensus. Ioannes Papa investi∣turam Leodicensis Episcopatus, quam Carolus Rex fecerat, Ri∣chario Prumiensi Abbati plane confirmat, et invasionem Hilduvini
per Gisilbertum Comitem de Capremonte sub anathemate damnat. Papa Leo primo Otthoni, aliique plures Pontifices Romani idem confirmaverunt sub anathemate Regibus et Imperatoribus. Vnde mirum est, imo periculosum in salutem animarum, quod ea quae sancti antecessores ex magna necessitate, et patenti ratione sub ana∣themate confirmaverunt, atempore Gregorii, qui et Hilteprandus, sub absolutione immutantur. Qui a primo Constantino, quem Sil∣vester baptizavit, gesta et decreta revolverit, patenter inveniet, quod per Reges et Imperatores, et devotos Laicos, Romana Ec∣clesia, aliaeque in orbe terrarum Ecclesiae, in fundis et mobilibus di∣tatae et exaltatae sunt, sibique tutelas et defensiones contra tyrannos et raptores retinuerunt, ut gladius Regalis et stola Petri sibi invi∣cem subveniant, quasi duo Cherubin conversis vultibus, respicien∣tia in Propitiatorium. Romani Pontifices, alii{que} prasules, de sundis & rebus per devotos Laicos et Laicas adquisitis, & a seculari potestate confirmatis, stru∣xerunt & ornaverunt Ecclesias: et a quibus acceperunt gratiam, non debent in∣ferre contumeliam, et si de investituris peccaverunt, exemplo primiGregoria. Geor∣gu exhibeantur. Quod Paulus dicit:2 Tim. 4. . Argue, obecra, increpa, in omni patientia & doctrina. Hieronymas in Epistolis suis dicit, Quadringentos Epi copo Imperiales li∣terae ad Synodum contraxerunt. In hoc virtus Imperialis egit, quod excommunicatio Pon∣tificis agere non potuit, ut sine captione, sine damnatione, sine contumelia, tot Episcopi ierunt & redierunt.Nota. Excommunicatio enim quanto inteligetur & timetur, tanto cavendo vitatur: & punitio corporalis in vita, vel in membris, & rebus vel in sundis, plures resi∣piscere facit ex justicia regali. Domino autem Pontifici summopere cavendum est ex medulla Scripturarum, ne quando liget in terris, quae Deus solvent in coelis: & quan∣do solvit in terris, Deus liget in coelis. Hoc evenit ex illa gloria praelationis, nimiis{que} motibus animorum, quando succedentes Pontifices praecedentium Pontificum decreta & ex∣communicationes immutant & solvunt. Unde cum Dominus Jesus, ipsa veritas, dicat: John 28. 29. Si male loquutus sun, testimonium perhibe de malo: mirum est, & periculosum in Christi pusillos, quod antiqua constituta sub anathemate confirmata, novis immutationibus sol∣vunt, & inde nolunt reprehendi, objicientes, Romana judicia non sunt retractanda. Si Ro∣mana judicia non sunt retractanda, non videtur pusillis Christi canonicum & salubre, ut a tempore Gregorii (qui & Hildeprandus) ea solvantur, quae sub anathemate consir∣maverunt , Leo, Adrianus, primus Gregorius, Leo, Benedictus, erga Reges et Imperatores, de investiendis Episcopis per illos: a quibus, et etiam a de∣votis Laicis & foeminis, fundi & alia mobilia, Ecclesiis omni in orbe terrarum pro∣venerunt, sibique tutelas et defensiones rerum Ecclesiasticarum retinuerunt contra tyrannos et raptores. Si in successione quisque solvit, quod praedecessio sub a∣nathemate confirmavit: ecce oritur confusio pusillis Christi, cui parti potius assentiendum sit, antiquae an novae. Pars antiqua in paupertate mediocri & honesta arguit, obse∣cravit in patientia & doctrina, & parcendo justitiae majores & inferiores personas ad correctionem adduxit. Nova autem pars ex votis fidelium insolescens, sub specie religionis omnia trahit ad se manibus expansis, cum Dominus dicat, Mat. 22. 2. Reddite Caesari, quae sunt Caesaris, & Deo quae sunt Dei; Gregorius, Augustinus, Am∣brosius testantur, ea quae sunt data Ecclesiis a Seculari potestate, et confirmata, potius a seculari potestate retinenda. Legitur etiam de Episcopis Hispaniae,Nota Scotiae, Angliae, Vngariae, quomodo ex an∣tiqua institutione, usque ad modernam novitatem, per Reges in∣troirent cum pace temporalium pure et integre. Qui pacifice sollicitus est, re∣volvat vitas patrum, & historias legat, & intelligat. Sed Episcopatus qui sub Ro∣mano degunt imperio, majoribus fundis, & amplioribus vigent justiciis; & ideo propter majus scandalum, à stola Petri discretius tractandi sunt, quia non omnes sunt Petrus, qui tenent sedem Petri. SicMat. 23. 2. Scribae & Pharisaei, qui sederunt super ca∣thedram Moysi, non omnes fuerunt Moyses. Elatio enim ex praelatione, et indis∣cretio ex correctione, pariunt scandalum in confusionem: & fit manifeste illud, quod Dominus in Evangelio dicit:Mat. 23. 15. Vos Scribae & Pharisaei circuitis mare & aridam, ut faciatis unum proselytum; & cum inveniretis, facitis filium Gehennae, duplo quam vos.
Longe etiam ante decretum Adriani Papae, ejusque successorum, Reges qui non erant uncti, et Majores domus, investituras Episco∣porum fecerunt: scilicet Dagobertus, Sigibertus, Theodoricus, Hilaricus, Pipinus filius Beggae Major Domus, Theodebertus. Ab his inthronizati sunt Remaclus. A∣mandus, Audomarus, Autpertus, Eligius, Lampertus, alisque sanctissim praesules; cum Reges isti in moribus suis satis fuerint notabiles, et solo nomi∣ne Regum per majores domus vivebant. Postquam autem Romani, in∣gruentibus vicinis & gravibus bellis, desciverunt a Graecis Imperatoribus, ex causis supradictis, Papa Stephanus ob infestinationem Longobardorum venit Parisios, & assensu Romanorum & Francorum in Regem & Imperatorem unxit Pipinum, filium Caroli Martelli, nati ex Alpaide: proter quam ex pellicatu increpatam, Pontifex Lampertus martyr factus est. Unxit etiam idem Pontifex Stephanus filios ejusdem Pipini, Carolum qui agnominatus est Magnus, & Carolomannum frarrem ejus, confir∣mans stirpem illorum in Regia & in Imperatoria dignitate. Ibi de Investiendis Episcopis per Reges, antiquam consuetudinem confirmavit: Ex horum collectione pure et integre servanda est antiqua constitutio, ne pusilli Christi scandalizentur. Nil enim refert, sive verbo, sive prae∣cepto, siue baculo, sive alia re quam in manu tenuerit, investiat aut inthronizet Rex et Imperator Episcopum: qui die consecrationis veniens, annulum et baculum ponit super altare, et in curam pa∣storalem Signa. singula suscipit a stola et ab aucthoritate sancti Petri. Sed congruum magis est, per baculum, qui est duplex, id est temporalis et spiritualis. Operatius enim in seminandis spiritualibus dignus est mer∣cede sua,In 1 Cor. 9. 11. non accipiendis temporalibus, juxta quod Paulus ait:In 1 Cor. 9. 11. Si spiritualia vobis seminamus, non est magnum si carnalia, id est temporalia a vobis metamus. Praece∣dens investitura per Regem in fundis et rebus Ecclesiae contra ty∣rannos et raptores, quieta et pacifica reddit omnia. Sequitur autem Consecratio, ut bannus Episcopalis banno Regali conve∣niens, in communem salutem operetur: et si Episcopis faciendum est regibus hominium, et sacramentum de regalibus, apertius est ante consecrationem, cum Paulus Apostolus dicat:Rom. 14. 5. Vnusquisque in suo sensu abundet. Omnia divina & Ecclesiastica per magistros Ec∣clesiarum ad pacem & quietem pusillorum Christi tendere debent. Legitur etiam in libris Regum et Machabaeorum, quod a regibus Iudaeis et gentili∣bus sacerdotes investituras acceperunt, etiam in Iudaismo. A Petro usque ad Silvestrum, qui Constantinum baptizavit, Imperatores Romani erant Gentiles, & Christianorum persecutores: & in fundis & rebus Ecclesiasticis pauperes erant Ecclesiae: & a timoratis Christianis, qui tunc pauci erant, Romae & alibi con∣stituebantur Episcopi. Postquam autem a Silvestro per Christianos Reges & Imperatores dotatae, ditatae & exaltatae sunt Ecclesiae in fundis, & aliismobilibus: & Imperatores tatum nteloneis, monetis, villicis & scabinis, comitatibus, advocatiis, Synodali∣bus bannis per Reges delegata sunt Episcopis: congruum fuit et consequens, ut Rex qui est unus in populo, et caput populi, inve∣stiat, et inthronizet episcopum, et contra irruptionem hostium sciat cui civitatem suam credat, cum jus suum in donum illorum transtu∣lerit. Primus Gregorius conqueritur dolendo, de quodam Episcopo, qui adeo pauper erat, ut de Episcopatu suo contra frigus hyemalem vestem habere non pos∣set. A taali Episcopo, forsitan sancto, non erat Regi necessarium exigere hominium, sa∣cramentum, obsides. Ex hoc, prout sunt consuetudines in regnis per orbem terrarum, de Episcopis investiendis servanda sunt antiqua jura. Sicut enim primus Gregorius dicit: Si voluissem, inquit, hodie Gens Longobardorum nec Regem nec Duces haberet: & quia Dominum timui, in alicujus sanguinem me miscere nolui. Ita successores ipsius Gregorii ca∣vere debent scandalum, ne contristent noviter Reges in suis anti∣quis juribus, per quorum antecessores caput et membra exaltata
et confirmata sunt: sed juxta Paulum a Pontifice Romano et Re∣gibus omnia fiant in charitate et humilitate, remotis superbia et contentione. Quapropter apud Pontifices & Reges fiant Ecclesiastica pure et integre, quia Dominus JESUS dicit:Mat. 6. 22, 2. Si oculus tuus fuerit simplex, totum cor∣pus tuum lucerna erit: id est, si intentio bona est, et opus bonum est. Si Romani Pontifices intendunt Regibus auferre antiqua jura de investiendis Episcopis, timent, dubitant, dolent pusilli Christi. Reges si in Episcoporum investituris excesserint, possunt a timoratis viris et Pontifice Romano argui, et ad rectam correctionis lineam reduci. Si autem in promotione et consecratione Episcoporum Pontifex Ro∣manus exorbitaverit, et sub verbo summae praelationis ad volunta∣tem suam egerit, non vult ut reprehendatur, cum Dominus Iesus se reprehendi concesserit, dicens,Johan. 18. 23. Si male locutus sum, testimoni∣monium perhibe de malo. Isti autem, Summus (in quiunt) Ponti∣fex anemine judicetur. Et si ab illa sua aucthoritate sub specie re∣ligionis introducuntur personae contra oculos Dei, ecce periculum et in capite et in membris: id est, qui scienter operantur, et sci∣enter cooperantur. Unde Dominus JESUS hypocrisin, et avaritiam, & cupiditatem sacerdotum in Evangeliis super omnia arguit, vocans illos se∣pulchra dealbata: et peccatum mulieris adulterae misericorditer suscipit: & tria genera eunuchorum humanè definit,Mat. 13. 27. Mat. 17. 24, 25. 26. c. 22. 17, 18 pro se & pro Petro tributum solvit, Re∣gibus jubet debita reddi.Rom. 13. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14. Petrus, Paulus, aliique in orbe terrarum viri sanctis∣simi concedunt in sententiam Domini JESU, qui omnibus dixit,Mat. 5. 9. Beati paci∣fici, quoniam regnum Dei possidebunt. Sunt autem Pacifici, qui ex contentione, arrogantia, cupiditate, ex nimiis motibus animorum, non moventur, non inveniunt commutationes contra antiqua jura propter pacem consti∣tuta, maxime propter potestates superiores, in quorum pace1 Tim. 2. 2, 3. juxta Paulum) tranquillam vitam agere debemus. Notandum est autem, Pontificibus Romanis et corum civibus, quando orta fuerat divisio in electione Pontificum, et in communione civium, non est par resti∣tuta nisi per Graecos Imperatores, quandiu Imperium ibi fuit: et per Francos Imp. ex quo Imperium Romanorum datum est eis. Et quidam Graeci Imperatores Christiani, quosdam Romanos Pontifices viros sanctissimos, us{que} ad exilium & mortem immisericorditer tractaverunt: sicut legitur de Agapeto, & de Joanne: Imperatores autem ex Francis, ho∣nestè & piè deduxerunt, sicut legitur de Stephano, et de Leone excaecato. De divisione cleri et populi in electione Romani Pontificis, comprehensa per Honorium Augustum, ex Graecis ita legitur: Bonifacius xl. Romanae praesedit Ecclesiae. Contra hunc Bonifacium ordinato Eulalio, et per hoc dissidente Ecclesia, ambo jussu Honorii Augusti, urbe egrediuntur, et sic re∣probato Eulalio, jussu Augusti, Bonifacius, quia prior ordinatus fuerat, sedi Apostolicae restituitur. De divisione Romanorum civium in electione Pontificum per Imperatores ex Francis adnihilata, ita legi∣tur: Otto primus Ioannem, quem Adalbertus Papam constituerat, iudicio Canonico deponi fecit, et Leonem ordinari fecit; et iste Io∣annes se cum uxore cujusdam oblectans, a diabolo percussus est, ac sine viatico mortuus. Post reditum Ottonis, Romani ex ambitione quendam Benedictum superposuerunt. Imperator rediens, obsessa Roma, Romanos caede et fame adeo afflixit, ut Leonem Papam se recepturos promitterent, et jurarent: Benedictus rejectus non so∣lum Papatu, sed etiam sacerdotio, a Leone exordinatur. Idem Benedictus Simoniace Papatu Romano invaso, cum esset rudis
literarum, alterum ad vices Ecclesiastici officii exequendas, secum Papam consecrari fecit. Quod cum multis non placeret, tertius superducitur, qui vices duorum expleret Romae. Ʋno itaque contra duos, & duobus contra unum de Papatu altercantibus, Rex Henricus filius Chon∣radi, contra eos Romam vadit: et eis Canonica et Imperiali cen∣sura depositis, Swyggerus Babenbergensis Episcopus, qui et Cle∣mens, Romanae Ecclesiae Cxlvi praesedit: et ab eo Rex Henricus ad Imperatorem benedictus est, jurantibus Romanis, se sine ejus consensu, ejusque successorum, nunquam Papam electuros. Igitur haec scandala gravia pastores animarum cavere debent, coram Deo, in vera simplicitate, propter pusillos. Ex quo Imperium Romanorum Ca∣rolo Magno acclamatum est, sunt anni trecenti et unum, est autem annus praesens, Millesimus centesimus nonus, quando ultimum Pascha fuit ab in∣carnatione Domini, secundum Cyclum Dionysii. I shall hereunto addeCatalog. Testium Veri∣tatis, Appendix p. 53. Flacius Illyricus his Argumentum Libelli praefixed to this Treatise of Waltramus. Hildebrandus ille, di quo ex historia Bennonis superius plura scribuntur, Cluniacensis sectae monachus, demum artibus suis post annum Christi MLXXIV. Pontificatum Roma∣num obtinuerat sub Gregorii septimi nomine: nullo tamen Romani Imperatoris, qui tunc Henrichus quartus erat, conseju accedente. Quod quidem ut contra ritus sacrosanctae Ca∣tholicae Ecclesiae esset, atque juribus authoritatique Imperii multum derogare videretur, sic Reip. maximam calamitatem peperit. Statim enim quibusdam Symoniacae haeresis quae∣sitis calumniis, Principibus Romanis potestatem conferendi Ecclesiastica officia eripere ten∣tabat: quam Imperatores ab eo tempore quo in Germania Christus praedicari coeperat, ha∣buerant integram. Papa autem causae caput ab ipso Imperatore inchoans, omnia miscebat: cum bellis occupatus Augustus, initiis obstare non posset: at{que} Conciliis, quae Papa hinc indicebat, consulto interesse nollet. Hinc in ipsum insidiae siruebantur, adeò ut & de vita periclitaretur. Quibus non succedentibus, aperta vi grassabatur in Imperatorem ambitiosus Pontifex, ac summissis inauguratisque demum tyrannis supplicem sibi reddit. Tandem de∣victis tyrannis, & Hildeprandum ipsum solio dejicit Augustus, cujus tamen victoria tan∣ta non fuit, quo minus Victor & Urbanus, insequentes duo Pontifices eo etiam invito Ro∣manam sedem ascenderent: Clemente, quem ipse ad eandem dignitatem intulisset, excluso. A Paschali deinde exagitatus Imperator, at{que} ab Henrico V. filio, quem Pontifex in∣stigaverat, & imperio et vita spoliatus, dum Pontifex odio adhuc flagrans, investiendi Episcoporum jus imperatoribus nititur extorquere: quapropter variae de hac re hinc inde ha∣bentur consultationes, diversis in locis congregantur Concilia, doctorumque virorum in∣genia seriis disputationibus exercentur; inter quos Waltramus hic, Namburgensis Epis∣copus, hunc quem damus Libellum exaravit. Pontifex autem ambitiosissimus, qui autho∣ritatem suam omnibus modis amplificare studebat, nullius acquiescens consiliis, captus tan∣dem, & vix liberatus, Henricho privilegia Francorum Imperatorum confirmavit: cujus confirmationis exempla apud Marianum Scotum, Nauclerum, atque aliis permultis in historiis extant. Statim verò post discessum Imperatoris, Pontifex retractavit quod con∣cesserat, Pravilegium nominans, quod scripto ediderat: quanquam morte praeventus, quod moliretur excqui, atque ipsius successor Gelasius dignitatem, quam inconsulto Imperatore invaserat, retinere non posset. Atqui Calixtus, qui ex Burgundiaca familia Papa effe∣ctus, minis, diris{que} abstentionibus, invisum omnibus Imperatorem reddidit: & ita terruit, ac nescio quo consanguinitatis vinculo enervavit, ut maximo, ac adhuc nunquam deleto Germaniae Imperii totius dedecore, jus investiendi Pontificis con∣donaret; ique apud Wormaciam ad Rhenum in campo quodam spaciocisissimo procla∣mare juberet.

Bruno autem Siguinus Episcopus, altius exorsus est, gratias agens Omnipotenti Deo, quod Dominum Paschalem Papam, qui praesenti Concilio praesidet, audivimus proprio ore con∣demnantem illud privilegium, quod pravitatem et haeresin continebat. Ad haec qui∣dam ex ast antibus Episcopis subjunxit; Si privilegium illud haeresin continebat, Ergo qui illud scripsit hae reticus fuit. Johannes autem Cajetanus ad haec commotus, Siguino respondit: Tu ne hic, & in Concilio, nobis audientibus Romanum Pontificem appelles haereticum? Scriptum quod fecit Dominus Papa, malum quidem fuit, sed haeresis non fuit. Et alter quidam adjecit, Imo nec malum dici debet, quia si liberare populum Dei bonum est, quod Dominus Papa fecit, bonum fuit: Sed liberare populum Dei bo∣num est, authoritate Evangelii, quia praecipimus,1 Joh. 3. 16. animas quo{que} pro fratribus ponere. The Popes patience being awakened, and moved with this charge of Heresie, com∣manding silence with his hand, said; Fratres & Domini mei audite; Ecclesia haec nun∣quam habet haeresin, imo hic omnes haereses conquassatae sunt, &c. On the 6. day of the Council, when as Cuno Praenestinus Episcopus frequently attempted to Excommunicate the Emperor therein, Johannes Cajetanus, and Petrus Leo, with some other of the Emperors friends resisted him to his face, and restrained him with these words: Ec∣clesia primitiva martyrum tempore floruit apud Deum, & non apud homines; Deinde ad fidem conversi sunt Reges, Imperatores, Romani Principes, qui matrem suam Ecclesiam sicut boni filii honest averunt, conferendo Ecclesiae Dei praedia, & allodia, seculares honores & dignitates, regalia quoque jura & insignia, quemadmodum Constantinus caeterique fideles; & cepit Ecclesia florere tàm apud homines, quàm apud Deum. Habeat ergo ma∣ter & Domina nostra Ecclesia sibi à Regibus sive Principibus collata, dispenset & tribuat ea filiis suis, & sicut scit, & sicut vult. Notwithstanding which opposition, Pascha∣lis privilegium Investiturae, quod in tentoriis concessisse videbatur, obliterare volens, iterans sententiam Papae Gregorii Septimi, investituram Ecclesiasticarum rerum a Laica manu rursus excommunicavit sub anathemate dantis & accipientis; Hereupon Cardinalis vero Dominus Cuno Praenestinus, talem Papae fecit inductionem Legationis suae, & contra disturbatores praesentis negotii competentem; Domine Pater, si tuae placet Majestati, si vere tuus fui Legatus, & quae feci tibi placent esse rata, in auribus Sancti hujus praesentis Concilii ore tuo edicito, & Legationem meam tua Au∣thoritate corrobora, ut sciant omnes, quia tu me misisti. Ad haec Apostolicus respon∣dens, ait; Vere Legatus ex latere nostro missusfuisti, & quicquid tu caeterique fra∣tres nostri, Cardinales, Episcopi, Legati Dei & Apostolorum Petri & Pauli hujus se∣dis, & nostra Authoritate fecerunt, confirmaverunt, probaverunt, ego quoque probo & confirmo, quicquid damnaverunt damno. Et Dominus Praenestinus consequenter subjunxit, qualiter pro sedis illius Legatione Hierosolymis audierit, Regem Heinri∣cum post Sacramenta, obsides & oscula, in ipsa beati Petri Ecclesia Dominum Papam tenuisse captum, indigne tractatum, potiora Ecclesiae membra, Car∣dinales videlicet, exutos, tractos, et male tractatos, Nobiles quo∣que Romanos occisos et captivos, et populorum stragem factam, audiens, ingemuerit, et pro hujusmodi facinoribus Ecclesiae Hiero∣solymitanae consilio et zelo Dei animatus, excommunicationis sententiam in Regem dictarit, et eandem in Graecia, Vngaria, Saxonia, Lotharingia, Francia, in quinque Conciliis, consilio praedictarum Ecclesiarum, renovando confirmarit. Orare se demum, ut sicut Dominus Papa Legationem suam confirmasset, ita praesentes Concilii Patres & Episcopi concorditer annuerent. Ad eundem modum Legati, & literae Domini Ʋiennen∣sis postulabant. Dum tali ratione et ordine, tam variae & dissonae multitudinis assen∣sus exquiritur, à saniori parte veritati & apertae rationi nihil contradictum, a paucis submurmuratum, ab Episcopis vel Abbatibus nullo modo reclamatum. The Emperors Excommunications being thus ratified by the Pope & Council, the sad consequences thereof are thus recorded byChronicon. Anno 1116, 1117, Chro∣nicon Bamber∣gense, Centur.

Hinc factiones extitêre, altera alterius agros vastare coepit, maximè vero Herbipolensis Dioece∣sis per Conradum Ducem (qui Imperatoris frater erat,) affligebatur; ac denique cun∣cta

Seditiones crebrae, ejectiones Praesulum, Castellorum demolitio∣nes, conflictus, caedes mutuae, oppressiones pauperum in frequen∣ti usu fuere, et neque pax Dei, caeteraque Sacramentis firmata pa∣cta custodiuntur: sed uniuscujusque conditionis & aetatis, praeter solos Ecclesiasticae professionis homines, quibus jam penè nihil praeter miseram restabat vitam, caeteri hoc tempore belluino furore bacchantur. The Emperor thus still vexed, excommunicated by this Luciferian Pope & his Pre∣lates, without any hopes of reconciliation by all his amicable Treaties, being tyred out with Papal delayes, & exasperated by new affronts, resolved to recover his right, & work out his peace by force of armes.Aventinus, Balaeus, and o∣thers forecited. In pursute whereof, Heinricus tantam incle∣mentiam Papae aegerrime ferens, exercitu conscripto, ipsemet Romam contendit, armis discre∣turus quod summa subjectione, & quotidianis precibus obtinere non poterat. Sed Papa id ani∣madvertens, sese in pedes conjecit, atque in Apuliam fugiens, ibi Rogerium contra Impe∣ratorem impellit. Dum itaque Romae Imperator est, in Apulia denuò suos convocat, quieti non assuefactus Paschalis; & primum quidem fulminibus suis Acheronta movet, deinde Rogerium hastis atque gladiis cruentis in Heinricum armat; who thought to surprise the Emperor at unawares; but being prevented by the Emperors sodain collecting of his forces, resolving to give him battel, he retreated with the Pope into Apulia. The Emperor often petitioned the Pope to absolve him from his Excommu∣nications, but he still affirmed he could not do it without the consent of the Bishops who concurred with him in the sentence, and that in a Synod, where both parties might be heard, the Bishops by their Letters urging him to continue it. During these delayes, the Emperor retyring with his forces from Rome into Germany, to suppress the Insurrections there raised against him by the Archbishop of Mentz and other Pre∣lates and Confederates of the Pope; Paschal thereupon returned to Rome, and repos∣sessed himself of St. Peters Church; whither the Emperor marching with a great Army to chastise him, Paschal soon after breathed forth his seditious Antichristian spirit. During these contests between the Emperor and Paschal concerning Investi∣tures, Yvo Carno∣tensis Epistola 196, 238, 239. Morney Histo∣ria Papatus, p. 286, 287. Ri∣chardus de Vas∣semburg in Chronico. there fell out this Quarrel between the King of France and him. About the year 1108. Pope Paschal presiding in the Synod of Treca in France, therein publish∣ed some Decrees against the Kings antient rights of Investitures, and Bishops Oaths, Homages, Fealty to him. In pursuance whereof, he presumed to make Richard Archdeacon of Virodune, Archbishop of Rhemes, to withdraw him from the Em∣perors party, and confirm his usurped Papal authority in France: which preferment Richard refusing, being made Bishop of Verdune by the Emperor, Paschal thereupon constitured Rudolphus Archbishop of Rhemes, by his own Papal authority, without the consent of King Lewis the Grosse, then newly come to the Crown, and involved in wars with his Barons: who thereupon taking possession of the Archbishoprick, King Lewes on the contrary, created Gervasius Archbishop, Et Archiepiscopatu Rhemensi pro suo jure investit: The City hereupon receiving Gervasius for their Archbishop, was interdicted and excommunicated by Paschal, who imployed Yvo Carnotensis, to mediate with King Lewes, to remove Gervasius as an intruder, re∣ceive Rudolphus into his royal favour, and grant him leave to enjoy the Archbisho∣prick. The King at last, upon Yvo his solicitation, concessit ut eum ad Curiam suam, quae Aurelianis in Natali Domini congreganda erat, Rudolphum securè adduceremus, & ibi cum eo & Principibus regni de hoc negotio, quantum fieri posset, salva Regni integri∣tate, tractaremus. But what the issue of this Treaty was, Yvo himself thus relates in his Epistle to Pope Paschal. Sed reclamante Curia, plenariam pacem impetrare ne∣quivimus, nisi praedictus Metropolitanus per manus et Sacramen∣tum eam fidelitatem Regi faceret, quam praedecessoribus suis Re∣gibus Francorum antea fecerant omnes Rhemorum Archiepiscopi, et caeteri Regni Francorum, quamlibet Religiosi et sancti Episcopi: Whereupon Yvo made this request to Paschal; Petimus ergo flexis genubus, ut hoc eo∣dem intuitu charitatis & pacis veniale habeat paterna moderatio, quod illicitum facit non aeterna lex (Dei) sed intentione acquirendae libertatis praesidentium (Pontificum) sola Prohibitio. So that this great Bishop and Canonist Yvo, deemed Kings investing of Bishops, and Bishops Oaths, Fealty made to Princes, constantly pra∣ctised
ever before & at that time by all the holy & religious Archbishops & Bishops of France, no wayes unlawfull by Gods Law, but by Popes meer prohibitions: Which he likewiseYvo Carno∣tensis Epist. 238, 239 asserted against John Bishop of Lions, and Hugo the Popes Legate in France, who expostulating, that this King had invested the Archbp. of Sienna against the Popes Decretals; Ivo declared it to be no Heresie nor crime (as Popes deemed it) cum hoc nullam vim Sacramenti in constituendo Episcopo, vel admissum, vel omissum, quod fidei & religioni officiat, habeat, cum Reges nihil spirituale se dare intendant, sed tantum votis petentium annuere, & bona exteriora, quae de munificentia Regum obtinent Ec∣clsiae, ipsis electis conceder, &c. Whereupon he made this supplication and gave this good advise to Pope Paschal, (who attempted, Hermanensem Episcopatum à Noviodu∣nensi distrahere, without the Kings royal assent:)Epistola 238. Nos sicut filii & fideles, rogamus & consuls, ut statum Ecclesiarum Galliae, quae quadringentis fermè annis duravit, in∣concuum manere concedatis; ne hac occasione Schisma, quod est in Germaeo Regiis adversus sedem Apostolicam, in Galliarum regno susciters.  enim Paternitas vestra, quod cum Regnum & Sacerdotium inter  conveniunt, bene regitur mundus, floret & fructificat Ecclesia: Cum vero inter se discordant, non tantum parvae res non crescunt, sed etiam maximae res miserabiliter di∣labuntur; whereupon this Pope made no further progresse in these Usurpations. ThisEpist. 62. & 171. Decreta∣lium, pars 16. c. 344. Yvo Carnotensis asserts the Supremacy of Kings as well in Ecclesiasticals as Temporals; That they ought not to be excommunicated; That if they receive any Excommunicate persons into their royal favor and protection, the Bishops, Priests and people ought to absolve and receive them into their Communion; Dispositiones rerum temporalium Regibus attributa sunt, & Basilei, id est, fundamentum populi et caput existunt; Si aliquando potestate sibi concessa abutuntur, non sunt a Nobis gravi∣ter exasperandi, sed ubi Sacerdotum admonitionibus non acquieverint, divino judicio sunt reservandi, (not to the Popes tribunal) ubi tanto districtius sunt puniendi, quan∣to minus fuerint divinis admonitionibus obnoxii; unde habetur in libroCapitularia Caoli Magni & Ludovici, c. 383. Concili  Tltan. 12. c. 3. Pthou Preuves de Li∣bertez de L'eg∣le Gallicane, c. 5, 6. p. 31, 32, 33, &c. Capitulorum Re∣galium auctoritate Episcoporum constitutorum. Si quos culpatorum Regia potestas aut in gratiam benignitatis receperit, aut mensae suae participes effecerit, his etiam Sa∣cerdotum et populorum conventus suscipere in Ecclesiastica communione debebit, ut quod principalis pietas recipit, nec a Sacerdotibus Dei alienum habeatur. Upon which account Yvo thus justifyed his reception of Gervasius, an Excommuni∣cated person, ad communionem in Paschali Curia: Pro regia honorificentia hoc feci, fretus auctoritate Legis praedictae, which he there recites; thus ratified and prefaced in his Decretals, and in the 12. Council of Toledo. Vidimus quosdam & flevimus ex nu∣mero culpatorum receptos in gratiam Principum, extorres extitisse a Collegio Sacerdotum; quod notabile malum illa res agit, quia Licentia principalis, in qua se solvi licentius curat, ibi alios alligat, & quos in suam communionem videtur suscipere, à communione & pace Ecclesiae eligit separare, & qui cum illa convescant, sola Sacerdotum communione priventur. Et ideo quia remissio talium qui contra Regem, gentem vel patriam agunt, per definitiones Canonum antiquorum in pote∣state solum regia ponitur, cui et peccasse noscuntur,ideo. adeo nulla se deinceps a talibus abstinebit Sacerdotum communio; Sed quos regia potestas aut in gratiam benignitatis receperit, aut participes mensae suae effece∣rit, hos etiam sacerdotum ac populorum conventus suscipere in Ecclesiasticam com∣munionem debebit; ut quod Principalis pietas habet acceptum, neque à Sacerdoti∣bus Dei habeatur extraneum. This was the received practice both of the Churches, Realms of France, Spain, and of England too, (as the learned French Advocate Pi∣erre Pithou proves at large, by several Histories, Presidents, Authorities;) before and under Pope Gregory, Ʋrban, and Paschal the 2. whose excommunications of the Emperors Henry 3. & 4. and their adherents, by all these resolutions, were meerly uncanonical, and voyd, by this approved antient Law, which gave Emperors and Kings power to absolve their Excommunicated Subjects, and exempted them∣selves much more from Excommunications, which Priviledge the French Kings Cler∣gy strenuously maintained against this usurping Pope Paschal; who though he mis∣carried in his Design of stripping the Emperor and King of France of their right of Investitures, yet he so terrified the King of Hungary with his Thunderbolts, that after a great Schism and contention between them, Literis graviter scriptis renun∣ciavit Pontifici Investituras Episcoporum & aliorum Praelatorum; as the
Cent: Magd. 12. c. 8. col. 1133. Century Writers inform us out of Martinus Capel. But these Letters being not extant, we cannot resolve upon what terms, or how farre he quitted this his ancient indubi∣table Prerogative royal, to this Pope. Before I proceed to the next Popes Contests with the Emperor, I cannot but in∣form you what censureChronicon Editione Fran∣cofurti 1566. f. 133, 134. Sigebertus Gemblacensis Monachus (living and dying under Pope Paschal, in the year of Christ, 1112.) hath given in his Chronicle of this Controversie between the Emperors and Popes about the right of Investitures. Anno 1111. Henricus Rex Romam vadit propter sedandam discordiam quae erat in∣ter Regnum & Sacerdotium, quae caepit a Papa Gregorio septimo, qui & Hildebran∣dus nominatus est, et exagitata a successoribus ejus Victorie & Urbano, et prae omnibus a Paschali, magno scandalo erat toto mundo. Rex au∣tem utimisprinted nolens. volens authoritate et consuetudine et authoralibus pri∣vilegiis Imperatorum, qui à Carolo Magno, qui post de Regibus Francorum imperavit Romanis; jamque per trecentos et eo amplius annos im∣peraverant sub 63 Apostolicis, dabat licite Episcopatus et Abba∣tias, et per Annulum et per Virgam. Contra hanc majorum au∣thoritatem censebant Papae Synodali judicio, non posse nec debe∣re dari per Virgam vel per Annuium Episcopatum, aut aliquam Ecclesiasticam Investituram a Laicali manu, et quicunque ita Episcopatum, aut aliam Ecclesiastici juris Investituram accipiebant, excom∣municabantur; Propter hanc praecipue causam Rex Romam tende∣bat. After which he reciteth theHere, p. 330. forementioned Charter and Oath of Pope Pas∣chal and his Cardinals, confirming this antient right of Investitures to the Emperor, and their perfidious violations thereof, upon which many prodigies and calamities ensued. I shall hereunto subjoyn these passages out ofAnnalium Boiorum, l. 6. p. 480, 485, 486, 490. Joannes Aventinus, rela∣ting the original and progresse of the Contests between this Emperor, Pope Paschal and his predecessors touching Investitures. Per triginta tres annos a Gregorio & Urbano continenter sanguine ovium belligra∣tum est, &c. donec Augustum Paschalis per filium Henricum è fastigio rerum in priva∣tum statum deturbavit, pollicitus se in Germaniam ad Conventum solennem Augustam Rhaetiae venturum. Dumque eo contendit, certior fit de morte Augusti (Henr. 4.) ad Padum ergo substitit, atque coacto suae partis Coetu, acta Gregorii Urbanique comprobat, Clementis tertii, caeterorum Episcoporum atque Augusti rescindit; pol∣lui Religionem, si quispiam sacrificus suffragio prophano cooptatus fuerit, fidemve principi dederit. Necesse est cuivis Christiano in Ro∣mani Pontificis leges jurare, decernit,See here, p. 325. &c. Proinde debere homines consi∣deratius jam loqui cum illo, atque pro legibus habere quae dicat. Quic∣quid adversus Romanum Senatum Pontificalemve se extulerit, contundendum esse decernit. Conventu peracto ad Caesarem Legatos cum manda∣tis mittit, se in Germaniam venturum, ubi de summis utriusque rebus colloquatur, pro∣mittit. Inde Romam ipse, at Caesar Reginoburgum ad hyemandum petit, adventum Pas∣chalis praestolatur, Verum is se in Gallias Cluniacum confert. Postea Augustobonae in Trecassiorum, & Galliae Lugdunensis Ʋrbe, conciliato sibi Galliae Episcoporum fa∣vore, ad captandum plebis auram, leges turbulentissimas rogat atque perfert. Caesarem de creandis Pontificibus ad disquisitionem vocat: ipsum Pontifica∣libus Comitiis excludit; ea ad Plebem transfert, nempe communem omnium Pastorem, communiter omnium suffragio capiendum esse statuit; pollui religionem, si quispiam sacris addictus caelestis atque immortalis Imperatoris Caeremoniarum consors sit, terreno atque mortali Regi se in Clientelam atque servitutem dicaverit. Sa∣cerdotiorum administrationem ad Pont. Max. armorum ad Caesarem pertinere. A sin∣gulis igitur Episcopis jusjurandum exactum, futuros in potestate Romani Pont. Hereupon the Emperor Henry the 5. in defence of his antient Imperial Rights and Ju∣risdiction against these Papal incroachments, by his publike Proclamations declared, & per Edicta ita obnunciat; Non licere Gallis curiosis, aliena, quae nihil ad eos atti∣nent, curare; cuilibet facile esse de alieno largiri. Christiani orbis Imperium sibi a Deo Opt. Max. impositum esse; proinde se de veteri more, et ri∣tu

Extare vetustissimam Sanctissimorum Patrum Legem tempore Caroli Magni perlatam, quae Paschalis, atque cum eo sentientes, per omnium Sacerdotum religio∣nes devoventur, atque proscribuntur. Nullo pacto fas jusque esse fastuoso Pon∣tifici, levissimis Gallis, magis superstitiosis, quam Religiosis, tot divos, tot pientissimos Pontifices maximos, minores Mystas, Mo∣nachos, Reges, Imperatores, Superos atque Caelites impietatis condemnare; se quoad vita suppetat, non passurum, ut instituta a majoribus accepta, per tot annos hactenus observata, fraude et astu paucorum, cum maximo Christianorum morum pernicie, obliterentur, Pontifices, Episcopos, mystas, Monachos ab Imperatoribus, atque Regibus collocupletatos esse; Ubi his pares opibus facti sunt, more perditorum, quo plura donata fuerint, plura concupiscere, illi{que} sordere prima quae{que} ubi majora sperarint: Titulo honesto libertatis Ecclesiasticae, fraudulentos homines grassari, illud conari ut se excluso, paulatim etiam populum, Sacerdotes, Episcopos alios in ordinem atque servitutem tandem redigant, atque arma in eis, quorum beneficia possident, ne haec aliquo pacto repeti queant, vertant. Pon∣tifices Romanos orbis Imperium animo cogitare, Regnum Chri∣stiani populi adfectare, non quieturos, donec oppresso Caesare om∣nibus jugum servitutis, quod ipsi excussere, imponant.

In hanc sententiam multae ultro citroque datae sunt Epistolae. Novissimè Caesar rescripsit: Quam∣vis veterem consuetudinem atque ritum a tot sanctissimis Patri∣bus per tot annos observatum, jure atque armis retinere possit, nihil tamen sua referre, si Pontificalibus Comitiis excidat; modo Episcopi, mystae, Monachi praedia stipendiaria, fiscos, nervos Reipub.

Convenit itaque inter Pontificem Max. atque Caesarem, uti Sacerdotes, Flamines, Pontifices Maximi, Minores, medioximi, omissis hujuscemodi Reipublicae, (ut Christus Magister noster appellat) spinis, victu parabili ac parco contenti, Christi praeceptoris nostri quoad liceat modestiam, paupertatem (ectentur, studio literarum operam navent. Atque ad hanc legem promulgandam jam Paschalis Romam ex Galliis redierat; where forgetting, rescinding all his premised Promises, Charter, Oaths, Obligations to the Emperor, (recited by Aventinus) he stirrs up all the Grman Prelates, (whereof the Archbishop of Mentz was the ring-leader) to conspire and rebell against him, when he expected nothing but Peace and Unity.

Dumque talia in Italia & Romae fiunt, Conradus Archimysta Boiorum ad Saxones defecit. Hugonem Episcopum Caesarianum, Brixina movet, Renoberthum Monachorum Salisburgensium Praesulem sufficit. Hainricum quoque Fruxinensem Episcopum abdicare conatur. Vischo∣pagum, alia templa, quae is consecrarat, resecat: Fruxinum inde se confert, Hain∣ricum Paschalis decreta refellentem dignitate moturus. Verum mystae ejus∣dem Fani, qui tum doctissimi omnium Sacerdotum Germaniae censebantur, Acta Paschalis, velut sacris literis contraria rescin∣dunt, Conradum exigunt. Qui a Salisburgensibus quoque exclusus in Saxoniam aufugit, Saxoniae Proceres, Episcopi, Archimystae hi, Conradus Juvavensis, Alber∣tus Mogontinus, Fridericus Agrippinensis, Theodoricus Legatus Paschalis in Agrip∣pinensi Colonia coeunt, Augustum et Episcopos ab eodem more et ritu priscae religionis in Senatum Pontificalem allectos, devovent, Im∣peratori hisque Pastoribus rebellantibus mandata detrectantibus, belligerantibus adversus Caesarem, veniam scelerum condonant, caelum aperiunt, caeteris claudunt. Fidem igitur servantes op∣pugnantur sub specie Religionis; stupra, incestus, sacrilegia passim committuntur; caedes, incendia impune fiunt. Augustus se quoque tutaturus Agrippinam Coloniam petit, agris circa vastatis in Saxoniam tendit, cum Saxonibus contendit, Segifridus ac Horo Manoveltrae Proceres Saxonum praelio suc∣cubuere, atque occisi sunt. Inter haec Conradus in Francia & ad Danubium, Fride∣rieus in Suvia & juxta Rhenum sorore Imperatoris geniti, fortiter acta avunculi tu∣tantur, Emicho dynasta partium Alberti Sarobriga, Episcopi Mogontini, authoris hu∣jusce belli Civillis, a Friderico occiditur, Stephanus Colomanni Regis Ʋngariae filius Lupoldus Austriacus cum Duce Boiemiae Ladislao, subsequuntur vestigia Ʋngarorum ad Eylenostadium progrediuntur: agris circum circa vastatis, incolumes revertuntur. In the mean time Machtylda (Hildebrands and Paschals grand Patroness) deceasing, Ibidem p. 484. Romano Episcopo legavit, id quod patrimonium Petri nominant (being in truth the Emperors Patrimony, not Peters) tuncque vox caelitus audita (uti a gravissimis ac∣cepi Theologis) Venenum melle litum foeminam propinasse. The Pope seising on her pretended Legacy, the Emperor hereupon to recover his right, and chastise him for his premised Conspiracies and Rebellion, Augustus cum exer∣eitu Italiam intrat, Machtyldae opes jure hereditario (nam cognata fuerit) possedit; but before his arrival at Rome Pope Paschal died. This Papal Usurper (as Annal. Boio∣rum l. 6. p. 491 Aventinus observes) was the first Pope who set the year and date of his Papacy to his Letters and Bulls instead of the Emperors, and granted immunities to Col∣ledges built by others. Priores Pontifices Romani ad diplomata, Epistolas, libellos om∣nes hactenus Imperatoris annos addiderunt, primus Paschalis hisce tacitis, suae pote∣statis numerum adscripsit, (which other Bishops since usurped) huncque pri∣mum immunitate donasse Collegia, licet ab aliis extructa, reperio.

Joannes Cajetanus, stiled Gelasius Se∣cundus, was chosen Pope by some of the Romans and Cardinals, without the Em∣perors privity, yet with great dissention. Nam cum sine Imperatoris con∣sensu eligeretur Cincius quidam Fregepanis dictus, Patricius Ʋrbis potentissimus, illius injuriam non ferens, ad Palladii Monasterium, ubi Cardinales erant congre∣gati, cum satellibus armatis venit, Imperatoris injuriam ulturus; Cupiebant e∣nim hac in parte tum authoritatem Imperatoris conservare, sicuti fidem ei de∣dissent, tum Ecclesiae patriaeque suae consulere. Cum autem monitionibus preci∣busque nullus daretur locus, impetu in Coventiculum Cardinalium facta, Cincius in eos irrumpens, refractis foribus, obvium quemque percussit; Pontificem obtorto ejus collo in terram dejectum calcibus contrivit, in vinculaque pro∣trusit,
ne sedem ascendat, donec Imp. ea de re certior factus esset. Cardinales autem fugam parantes ex mulis et equis dejecit, nul∣lumque genus contumeliae praetermisit, quo affici tantus Senatus posset. Sed non tulit tantam injuriam populus Romanus, quin auxilio Normannorum eum tandem liberaverit, & hostes ad pedum oscula compulerit. Hinc Imperator Henricus (to vindicate his Imperial Jurisdiction and right in the Popes election and removal of this Intruder) Exercitum magnum ex Germania Romam misit. Gelasius hereupon, conscious of his guilt and inability to resist, cum suis Cajetam navigio mox petiit, ibique Sacerdos factus est, cum solum Diaconus ante creatus fuisset Pontifex. Henricus Romam veniens absente Gelasio (by his Imperial Soveraignty and Privilege) Mauritium Burdinum Bracharensem Archiepiscopum pontificem creavit, ac Gre∣gorium octavum vocavit, eumque familiae Frangepanum commendans tuendum, inde abiit. Quo audito Gelasius clam redit, & sumpto animo prodit in aedem Praxedis, Mis∣sam facturus. Ubi ab adversaria parte ita fuit impetitus, ut aegrè fuga suae incolumitati consuleret. Animadvertens igitur Pontifex se imparem iis quos Caesar jusserat Burdini partes defendere, gravi concitata seditione, quasi faetore suo relicto, ipse iterum in fugam dilabitur. Elapsus difficulter manibus suorum hostium, Pisas navigavit, atque inde in Galliam solvit, ad portum S Aegidii, & consecratis in via inter eundum aliquot Eccle∣siis, scilicet S. Caeciliae in Stagello, S. Sylvestri in Tullano, & S. Stephani in Torna∣co. (Christum nullibi praedicabat) lapidibus earum terminos notabat.Chron. Ann. 1118. p. 262. Abbas Usper∣gensis relates, that this Pope in contempt of the Emperor and Magistracy, assembled a kinde of Synod at Capua of his conjured Prelates, wherein Caesarem cum Antipapa Burdino (quem vocat idolum Caesaris) damnavit, inde in Galliam iter facit.

Annalium, l. 6. p. 491. Joannes Aventinus relates, that Paschali vita defuncto, Romani certiorem faciunt Imperatorem, petunt ut Romam veniat, atque Comitia Pontificalia cum Sacerdotibus Senatu populoque, more majorum habeat.

Augu∣stus Comitiis Pontificalibus, clientela Episcoporum destitutus, arbitrio Coetus Eccle∣siastici excidit Pontificatus universi, sacerdotiaque beneficia Ro∣mani Pontificis facta sunt. Thus Aventinus in brief.Abbas Usper∣gensis, Sige∣bertus, Platina, Martinus Po∣lonus, Stella, Hermannus Schedel, Barns, Balaeus, Onu∣phrius, & Cen∣tur. Magd. 12. in Calixto 2.

Abbas Ʋspergensis, Albertus Krantzius, Platina, and others quoted in the margin, render us this larger Narrative of the election and proceedings, of Calistus. Pope Gelasius deceasing in the Abbey of Cluny, Anno 1119. the fugitive Cardinals of his faction assembling in that Abbey in opposition to the Emperor, and support of the Hildebrandian Faction, created Calixtus the 2d. Pope, in the life of Burdinus whom the Em∣peror had made Pope, and stiled Gregory the 8. Contra Burdinum igitur Calixtus non prius capit arma, quam Caesarem sua Excommunicatione compulisset, ut sibi praeberet suffragium et extorsisset Investiturae Episcoporum privilegium; To which end Calixtus sent Conon his Legat into Germany to excommunicate the
Emperor, in order to deprive him of his Crown. This Excommunication be∣ing publickly denounced first at Colen, and then at Friburgh in a German Synod of Bishops, thereupon coactus est Imperator (to post out of Italy into Germany) apud Triburiam Conventum Episcoporum & Principum agere, ut concordia inter ipsum & Papam statim procuraretur. Et ne Pontificum arte regno (ut ejus piissimus Pater) exueretur, conditiones Pacis valdè iniquas admisit. Missis Triburiam Oratori∣bus, Calixti hujus electionem ad summum sui dedecus confirmare cogitur, (vivo ad huc Gregorio seu Burdino, quem ipse pontificem prius fecerat) ne velit à dig∣nitate sui Imperii excidere. Hoc scilicet erat caput rei, & causa cur regnum Romanum concuteretur. The Pope and his Confederates not satisfied with this his great con∣descention in the Council at Friburg, Pontificis Legati & Episcopi deinde perurgentes eum, ut de jure suo investiendi Praelatos cederet, atque tradat Ro∣mano Praesuli, id enim postulare ipsum securissime et strictissime. Thereupon the Emperor, who in a former Council atAventinus Annal. Boo∣rum, l. 6. Here p. 341, 342. Morney Hist. Papatus, p. 283, 284. Mentz asserted, Christiani orbis Imperium sibi a Deo Opt. Max. impositum esse, proinde se de veteri more et ritu priscae religionis, sacris Supremae Magistratus placitis non defuturum, &c. insisting upon his ancient undoubted right, multa ultro citro{que} de hac re disputantur: Sed velle Pontificis praeponderat. In tantas igitur angustias Caesar redactus, et aut cedendum suo veteri jure, aut regnum amittendum esset; petit inducias & potestatem cum Principibus conferendi; Sed illi perterriti at∣que examinati paene tam potentis Praesulis Romani fulmine, ad unum omnes suadent, cedendum esse voluntati Papae, ni velit sese universamque Ger∣maniam in extremum discrimen adducere. Consulit porro amicos atque adversarios, verum nihil solatii uspiam audit. Expugnatus itaque Caesar; quasi suppli∣ces manus porrigit, necessitatique, tanquam durissimo telo, parendum esse dicernit; (Sic ejus tandem Dominus retaliabat proditiones in pientissimum patrem suum, as Balaus and others observe.) Hereupon, Percepta illa grata fama, Caesarem vo∣luntati Papae, seujugo, sese submittere, non sibi celandum putat Calixtus, sed absque mora, ad S. Lucam Conventum indicit ad 13. Calend. Novembris. Promiserant au∣tem qui Triburiae fuerant se ad eum locum venturos, quem Papa designasset. Vicinum quoque Caesar sese praebet, sicut Catalaudensis Episcopus, & Cluniacensis Abbas cum Henrico Argentinae transegerant. Adfuerunt autem ipsi Calixto circiter 426. Pa∣tres, innumera Clericorum & populi multitudo. Vlcus erat Investiturae negoti∣um quam tenebant Laici, inter quos princeps erat Caesar Roma∣nus. Legati Imperatoris Henrici sua proferunt privilegia anti∣qua a Pontificibus obsignata, et diuturnam possessionem, et jus ipsum atque aequitatem; sed eis se Papa Calixtus cum suis cre∣aturis pro Authoritate opponit, omnia antiqua jura repudians, et mandans, se velle id dignitatis sibi attribui. Legati singulari re∣verentia, inducias ulterius petunt, et vix extorquent. Papa autem nihilominus Synodalia suorum antecessorum decreta confirmat, hoc est, decernit jus inve∣stiendi Episcopos penes Episcopos Romanos, et non penes Caesarem esse: (being against all rules of Law, reason, justice, the sole Judge in his own cause, and pronouncing sentence for himself): & sic omnem suam potentiam adversus Caesarem di∣rigit. Hoc pacto diebus duodecim Synodus ista finitur. In Italiam deinde Papa reversus maxima pompa, ut Papam Caesarem decebat excipitur. And here we may behold the pro∣per Genius of the Popes and Popish Prelates, when ever they were in distresse, and needed the Emperors and other Princes ayde to assist and defend them against their Potent adversaries, they would then cry up, ratifie and confirm their Soveraign Pow∣er and Patronage over themselves, and all other Churches, and ratifie their right of electing, confirming Popes, and of Investitures, by Canons, Councils, Oaths, Instru∣ments, but no sooner were they reestablished in their Chairs by them, but present∣ly upon the first advantage they violated, abjured, revoked all their former Oathes, Canons, Engagements, and excommunicated, dethroned, and trampled them under their feet, with highest scorn, contempt, like most perfidious ungratefull Traytors. Anno sequenti, hoc est Vigesimo, in Germania Episcopis Papa literis praecipit, ut va∣cantibus Cathedris Canonicè, uti loquebatur, Pastores eligerent. Hac ratione & decre∣tis, & ipsa praxi, licet inducias verbis dedisset, ne tamen ipsa Papa Caesari jus inve∣stiendi Episcopos eripit. Moguntinus Praesul Albertus (seu Adelbertus) Ro∣mano Papae Caesari addictus omnem Romano Imperatori Reverentiam detrectabat. Ita∣que
Henricus eum persequitur. Pelluntur & Spirensis & Wormatiensis Episcopi suis sedibus, quia in gratiam Papae nolebant Imperatori communicare. Sed Moguntinus Duces Saxoniae extimulat, ut arma contra Caesarem sumant, et hisce facibus accensi Saxones ante Moguntiam exercitui Caesaris suas opponunt copias, neque procul aberat res à cruento praelio. Sed Sapientum quorundam interventu duodecim Prima∣tes ex utraque parte deliguntur, qui de rebus inter Regnum & Sacerdotium, uti loquuntur Scriptores, componendis, consultarent, atque statuerent. Locus denominatur Herbipo∣lis, seu Wirtzburg ad diem Michaelis, Anno Domini 1121. Veniunt autem eò arma∣ti utraque pars, ac consultatio inchoatur. Tandem Septimana integra controversiis agi∣tatis, sancitur pax tali pacto, ut regalia vel fiscalia regno, Ecclesiastica Ecclesiis praedia spoliatis, Haereditates haeredibus manerent, & cuilibet personae sua tribueretur justitia. Praedones ac fures edictis Imperialibus, & juxta leges antiquas cohercendo. Scandala & perturbationes excitatas in Germania, omni ratione sedandus & extirpandas. Excom∣municatione unde ista mala omnia scaturirent, ad Apostolici regiminis audientiam esse rejiciendam. Denominati etiam sunt Legati Bruno Episcopus Spirensis, & Ar∣nulfus Abbas Fuldensis, qui Romam istam concordiae rationem perferrent, ac Papam de Generali Concilio in Germania instituendo sollicitarent. Anno sequenti mortuo Herbi∣polensi, Imperator Gebhardum constituit Episcopum; Sed alii Ruggerum diligunt, ac Moguntinus quidem contra Imperatorem eum confirmat instigantibus Legatis Pon∣tificiis qui venerant, ut contra Imperatorem facerent omnia.

Redeuntes Spirensis & Fuldensis ex Italia, secum adaucunt Papae Caesaris Legatos, plenissima instructos potestate ad transigendum omnia, quae ad Caesarem Papamque perti∣nerent: nempe Lambertum Ostiensem, Saxonem, Sancti Stephani, & Gregorium Sancti Angeli Cardinales. Hi vultures Romani mox Wormatiae indicunt Conven∣tum Principibus & Episcopis, Caesare adstipulante. Nam ille nunc se passivè quidem habebat, prostratus ictu Pontificio, ac cermens se necessitatem praesentem nulla vi effugere posse. Caput disputationis est Investitura Episcoporum, quam e manibus Laicorum omni Authoritate et vi extorquendum esse, Papa Romanus decreverat. Etsi autem plurima de jure Caesaris, et usu diuturno antecessorum, deque plurium Pontificum permissione, et comprobatione in medium afferrentur, tamen vicit, Sic volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas. Nam Magistratus Politicus debebat (juxta ipsius2 Pet. 2. 10. Petri vatici∣nium, ab hususmodi hominibus summa ignominia affici, atque egre∣gie pedibus conculcari.

Formulae verò sunt ejusmodi: Ego Heinricus, Dei gratia Imperator Augustus, pro amore Dei, et Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae, et Do∣mini Papae Calixti, et pro remedio animae meae, dimitto Deo, et Sanctis ejus Apostolis Petro et Paulo, Sanctaeque Catholicae Ec∣clesiae, omnem Investituram per Annulum et Baculum: et con∣cedo in omnibus Ecclesiis fieri electionem et liberam consecratio∣nem.

Hoc pro bono pacis Henrico so∣li concessum esse, et non successoribus ipsius. Attende igitur quam honestè, & candide illi homines agant! Haec diplomata ubi Romam perlata sunt, incredibilem excitave∣runt laetitiam et tripudium. Vt autem triumphus ille de manu∣biis Caesari ereptis Communis et illustrior esset, Sanctissimus Papa Caesar Calixtus 2. eas literas de extorta resignatione et re∣nunciatione Iuris Caesarei de Investitura Episcoporum, in Ec∣clesia Lateranensi publice suspendit, ut omnibus et risum et insul∣tationem, more scilicet vere Apostolico, moverent. Pope Calixtus having thus publickly triumphed over the Emperor, and forci∣bly wrested out of his hands the right of Investitures, after above 46 years hot contests, and bloudy warres about it, between the Imperial Scepter, and Papal Myter, he next addressed himself to vanquish his Competitor Gregory the 8. by the Temporal, as he had conquered the Emperor by the Spiritual sword; whereup∣on Otto Frisin∣gensis, l. 7. c. 16 Platina, Onu∣phrius, Stella, Barnes, Balaeus in Calixto 2.

Ipse Pontifex ad visitationum, scilicet Ecclesiasticam, praemisse exercitu cum gladiis, lanceis & tormentis, pedetentim subsequitur, quia Burdinus adhuc nomen Pontificium arrogabat, quod electione habebat, Romanos incursionibus infestabat; & ut qui contra se latrocinia exercebat, peregrinos religionis & suorum negotiorum causa cum turgida crumena Romam adventantes pecuniis spoliabat, quas Papa, Cardi∣nales, & sacrifici avide expectabant. Quid fit? Sutrium expugnatione Petrino∣rum capitur, Burdinus in potestatem Calixti traditur. Jam attende, quanta clemen∣tia mitissimus Papa erga hunc suum rivalem, usus sit; Burdinum (non sine summa Caesaris, et Papatus ignominia) crudis & sanguinolentis pellibus caprinis amictus, per mediam Civitatis, via Regia, ut magis publicaretur educitur, & imperante Domin Papa Calixto, imponitur camelo, capite ad caudam verso, candamque manu tenentem, publicéque omnibus deridendum & conspuendum exponitur; tandemque monaste∣rio eum tanquam in carcerem intrudit, & ad tantae ultionis memoriae conservationem, in camera palacii sub pedibus Calixti conculcatum depinxerunt.

To which he annexed Decrees and Canons against Priests wives, and marriages. By these Canons, this Pope and his Successors since engrossed into their own hands the disposal of most Archbishopricks, Bishopricks, and other preferments, which they bestowed on their Creatures, or those who would give most money for them, with∣out the guilt of Sacriledge, or Simony, to maintain their usurped Soveraignty against the Emperor and his Successors, and therebySee Mr. Tyn∣dals Practice of Popish Prelats, and Obedience of a Christian man, p. 114, 115, 137, to 155. 180, to 184. monopolized into their hands the Go∣vernment of the Empire, and all Christian Realms, all Archbishops, Bishops, Ab∣bots, dignities, and the whole Clergy being thenceforth solely dependant upon the Pope, not Emperor, Kings, Princes; who in that and subsequent ages were both Legats, sworn Vassals, Homagers to the Pope, and the Grand swaying Officers of State, Privy Counsellors, Chancellors, Treasurers, Secretaries, as well as Confessors to the Emperor, the Kings of England, France, Spain, Hungary, Poland, Denmarke, Scotland, and other Princes; siding with the Pope against the Emperor, Kings, Prin∣ces, their Crownes and Interests, whenever they came in competition with the Popes usurped Supremacy and Jurisdiction, and betraying their secrets unto him. Rupertus Tuitiensis Abbas,Anno 1120. a learned Author flourishing under this Pope, l 9. in Mat. c. 11. writes thus against these usurpations. Viro spiritualis propositi non conceditur eva∣ginare gladium.Rupertus in Matth. l. 8. Virga Discipulorum Christi, est virga Pastoralis Officii, super curam animarum sollicitè vigilantis; Illam namque virgam quae Dominationis est non esse concessam Ministris Evangelii Pacis (much lesse then the swords) interdici imo hic, &c.Idem l. 11. c. 13. in Jo∣han. Christi Ministri sciant Apostolatum non esse Dominium, sed sum∣mae Humilitatis Ministerium, ut ponant animas pro fratribus suis. And if this be not sufficient, he thus quite subverts the foundation of Peters and the Popes Supre∣macy. Idem l. 2. c. 2. in Johan. Christus super seipsum, videlicet firmam petram, suam aedificat Ecclesiam. Et mutato nomine, Petrus à petra denominatum, per quod significatum est, quia cunctis su∣per illud fundamentum (quod est Christus) aedificantur, juxta Prophetam vocandum sit no∣men novum quod os Domini nunciavit.

In his 82 Epistle to Pope Honorius the 2. he thus declaimes against Appeales to Rome.Bibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 12. pars 1. p. 346, 347. Honorio Deigratiâ Excellentissimo & Reverendissimo Patri suo Sanctaeque Romanae Ecclesiae Summo Pontifici, H. humilis Turonum Minister, debitae integritatem obedientiae.

Ideo cumulatis precibus exoro, ne vos Reverende Pater, scriptum praesens exasperet, aut velitis de necessitate praesumptionem figurare. Etenim necessitate scripsi, eodem quo sum laesus jaculo, laedi metuens Ecclesiae sospitatem. Bonam spem in sinu meo gero, quia scribens pro justitia, gratiam Patris non avertam. Quaslibet igitur Appellationes in Romana vigere et suscipi Ecclesia, cis Alpes auditum non est, nec ex sacris traditum institutis. Quod si forte hujusmodi emersitAppeales to Rome from this side the Alpes, a No∣velty then first introduced, and thus oppugned. no∣vitas, ut placeat omnem indifferenter admittere Appellationem,
Pontificalis censura peribit et omnino conteretur Ecclesiasticae ro∣bur disciplinae. Quis enim raptor ad solam Anathematis comminati∣nem non statim Appellabit? Quis Clericus aut Presbyter, frustra∣toriae Appellationis refugio non putrebit, aut etiam sepelietur in stercore suo? Quis Episcopus habebit in promptu, non omnem dico, sed aliquam ulcisci inobedientiam? Ejus virgam quaevis Appellatio quassabit, solvet constantiam, severitatem emolliet, adducens et illi silentium, et reis impunitatem delictorum? sic fiet ut sacrilegia ac rapinae, fornicationes ac adulteria pernicioso inundent incremento, cum Praesul ad superfluas Appellationes clauserit ora, et desierit persequi piorum persecutores locorum, cum viduarum injurias desie∣rit ulcisci et Orphanorum. Dilatione nimirum censurae facinora fo∣vebuntur, et venient in profundum iniquitatis impune delinquentes; super quos Evangelicum illud implebitur praeceptum,Luke 14. Exi cito in plateas, & vicos Civi∣tatis, & pauperes ac debiles & caecos, & claudos introduc huc. Quis vel caecum vel claudum intrare compellat, si caecus, cum compelletur, appellet? Denique pro delicto Heli, nullus Pontificum punietur, quoniam Appellationis excusatione suam quis{que} defen∣deret offensam. Exempla quaedam censurae semper vivent, aemulatores autem ejus, quaelibet Appellatio sepelicet & vivos. Sane parva est materia, & exilis scientia, quae si (juxta Job 39. Job) Inter aquilas in praeruptis lusitantes cum pullis earum sanguinem lambit, satis est. Non erubesco meam & attendere & profiteri mensuram. Inter caeteros tamen Sacerdotes ad me pervenit, quas Appellationes Cisalpina susceperit Ecclesia, quas et sine of∣fensione, sedis Apostolicae renuit et abjecit. Accepi enim, & universitas Ecclesiae prae∣dicat, quod gravatis judicio, subventus Appellationis debeatur. Accepi, quod suspectos habens judices aut infestos, aut formidans vim temerariae multitudinis, eodem remedio possit & debeat relevari. Ʋnde etiam inGratian, Caus. 2. qu. 6. Decretis Cornelii Papae, taliter Ecclesiae traditum est: Si quis Judicem adversum sibi senserit, vocem Appellationis ex∣hibeat, quod nulli oportet negari. Item in eodem, Nullus Sacerdotum causam suam alieno committat judicio nisi ad sedem Apostolicam fuerit Appellatum, sed unusquis∣que comprovinciales Judices & notos habeat, nisi aliquem vim temerariae multitudinis illic timuerit, aut infestos vel suspectos Judices ibi habuerit; pro quibus causis ad majo∣ris authoritatis Judices, & ad alias provincias appellare & venire concessum est. An∣divi etiam alias quoque Appellationes esse, sed moratorias nec aliquando recipiendas, de quibus in sacris legibus his legimus verbis. Quicunque non confidentia justae causae, sed causa afferendae morae ne contra eum sententia proferatur Appellaverit, & si de facto suo confessus ne addicatur Appellare voluerit, hujusmodi Appellationes non re∣cipiuntur. Et quidem videri mihi plures talium Appellationum species, quas prudens Ju∣dex ita necesse est discernat, ut circa Judicandos debitam in omnibus servat aequitatem Porrò ea quae Praerogativam obtinent, sicut parvitati meae ministravit authoritat, per∣strinxerit, quae si plura sunt; etiam usque ad ipsius Cathedrae vestrae sedem Apostolicam in∣currere vigilantia: confiteor non transgrediendos esse terminos quos posuerunt Patres nostri; Moratorias autem Appellationes omnino a vestra relegandas esse audientia, nec sustinendum in horto Domini plantari toxicum mor∣tis; toxicum quo subventus afflictorum morietur, quo justitia in nihilum reverteretur, incrementum suscipiat ubertas delictorum. Vale. This Bishop being violently taken and detained in prison by Earl Hubert, there∣upon writ thisEpistola 40. Bibliotheca Pa∣trum, Tom. 12. pars 1. p. 325. Epistle to H. Sagiensi Episcopo, (not to the Pope) to excommuni∣cate him till he should release him. Duos in coena fuisse gladios, hoc quoque & legis & intelligis. Ʋnum quidem Petrus in Malchum vibravit, dum Malchus in Christum ma∣nus extenderet; alter verò eductus fuisse non legitur. Aptè profecto inventus est uter∣que apud Discipulos Christi, quia adhuc uterque ostenditur in membris corporis Chri∣sti: Gladius duplex, Curiae, & Ec∣clesiae. Membrum enim Christi, Rex; membrum Christi, Sacerdos: Scienti loquor, nosti gladium Regis, nosti gladium Sacerdotis. Gladius Regis, censura Curiae; Gladius Sacerdotis, Ecclesiasti∣cae rigor disciplinae. Hos Evangelistam signasse legisti, dicentem;Luc. 22. 38. Domine, ecce gla∣dii

Arguam te, et statuam contra faciem tuam. In which passage, it is remarkable; 1. That this famous Bi∣shop and Archbishop, (one of the first who wrested the two swords in Luke 22. to typifie only the temporal and ecclesiastical Swords of Jurisdiction) directly resolves, the sword that Peter used in cutting off Malchus his ear, to be the Temporal sword, belonging to the King, not Spiritual, which was then hid amongst the other Apostles, but not drawn forth by Peter or Christ against those who laid violent hands upon, and crucified him. How then this later sword can belong to Peter, Popes, or Prelates alone, by divine right, let Pontificians resolve the world when they are able. 2ly. That he asserts, the King to be the Supreame Member in the body of Christ, to whom St. Peters sword appertains; not the Pope, Bishops, or Priests, who have only that sheathed sword which Peter and the other Apostles did not then draw forth. 3ly. That so long as the Kings sword is drawn, exercised in and for the Church, or its Members; the Spiritual sword of Excommunication ought not to be drawn or used. 4ly. That the Ecclesiastical Sword equally belongs to every Bishop, Angel, Priest of God, as much as to St. Peter, or the Pope, who may lawfully draw it out, when ever there is occasion, without the Popes Commission, License, Permission. 5ly. You may hence observe, how much this Text hath beenSee Baronius Annal. Ann. 1053. Sect. 10. Bellarmin de Romano Pont. l. 5. c. 5. perverted by Popes and their Advocates, to maintain the Popes title to the Supreame Temporal and Spiritual swords of Authority & Jurisdiction in & over all Christian Kings, Kingdoms, which (as I haveHere, p. 63, to 67. formerly evidenced) make nothing at all for these two Metaphori∣cal Swords, Jurisdictions, or St. Peters, or his pretended successors Title to them. For if we believeIn Luc l. 5. See Hil in Mat. Can. 32. In Luc. l. 10. Augustin, Cas∣siodorus, Bruno in Psal. 44. & 49. Dr. Beard Antichrist the Pope of Rome, p. 197, 198. Marlorat, in Luc. 22. St. Ambrose, and others, these two swords, which the Apostles then had, and Christ resolved to be enough, were only the Old and New Testament, which Saint Peter and the other Apostles were to draw forth, open, explain, and preach to all Nations for their instruction, the slaying of their sinnes, errors, corruptions, pric∣king them at their hearts, arming them against all the assaults of the Devil, and for the edification, conversion, defence and salvation of their souls: Which exposi∣tion of theirs is warranted by Luke 24. 25, 26, 27. Rom. 1. 1, 2, 16, 17, c. 10. 6. to 21. c. 16. 25, 26. Eph. 2. 17, to 22. c. 3. 5, to 12. Mat. 28. 19, 20. Mark 16. 15, 16. compared with Eph. 6. 17, 19. Hebr. 4. 12, 13. Rev. 1. 16. c. 2. 12, 16. c. 19. 14, 15, 16, 21. Ps. 45. 3. Ps. 149. 6. Isay 49. 2. Mat. 10. 34. Duo Gladii, unus veteris, alter novi Testamenti, quibus adversus Diaboli armamur insidias; & dixit, Satis est, quia nihil deest ei quem utriusque Testamenti doctrina munierit. Gladius Sermo Domini Servatoris; ideo anceps, quoniam duo contineat Testamenta, is the general and ge∣nuine resolution of St. Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostom, Jerome, Beda, Cassiodor, Bruno, Lyra, Hugo de Sancto Victore, the Ordinary Glosse, most Orthodox Interpre∣ters Old and New, on these Texts; This is the only sword proceeding out of Christs mouth, which he came to send into the world: which himself brandished or made use of whilst on earth, & committed to his Apostles, Ministers, Peter, (or the Roman Pontiffs, admitting them to be his genuine Successors) after his death and resur∣rection: not the Supream Spiritual or Temporal Coercive Sword of Jurisdiction in and over all Persons, Churches, Kingdoms, causes whatsoever, as Popes and Ponti∣ficians most blindly inferr from hence, against the Letter, true scope of this Text, Exposition of the Fathers, and their own learned Expositors. 6ly. These words Lu. 22. 36, 38 But now, he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one, &c. And they said, Lord, Behold here are two swords; And he said, they are enough, are thus inter∣preted
by the Fathers. St.In Lucae E∣vangel. l. 10. Ambrose hath this Meditation on these words in St. Pe∣ters name; O Domine, cur emere nos jubes gladium, qui ferrire me prohibes? Cur habere praecipis, cum vetas promi? nisi fortè ut parata sit defensio, non ultio necessaria, & videar potuisse vindicari, sed noluisse. Lex tamen referire me non vetat: & ideo for∣tasse Petro duos gladios offerenti, sat est, dicit; quasi licuerit usque ad Evangelium; ut sit, in Lege aequitatis eruditio, in Evangelio bonitatis perfectio. Multis hoc iniquum videtur, sed non iniquus Dominus, qui cum se possit ulcisci, maluit immolari.Hom. 85. in Mat. Tom. 2. Opera. St. Chry∣sostom hath the like; Cum illi dixissent, Duos se gladios habere, Christus satis esse re∣spondit: Cur igitur habere permisit? ut facilius crederent, quod tradetur: Propterea dixit eis, emat gladium; non ut percutiant animat, sed ut proditionem per hoc declara∣ret. Propterea Petrus gladio usus comminatione, & quidem vehementi repraehenditur: Which Beda, Theophylact, Hugo de Sancto Victore, Lyra, Erasmus, Aretius, Calvin, Beza, Marlorat, Heinsius, Walaeus, and others on this Text recite, yea second; and Origen before them, Tract. 35. in Matth. gives the like interpretation thereof. The summe, scope of which words they resolve to be this; 1. To give a further check to the Disciples ambitious spirit and contest for precedency or worldly grandure (which he had reprehended immediately before) by minding them of the persecutions and hardships they should suffer after his passion, ascention, and thereby advising them to provide against them. 2ly. To instruct them, that in times of persecution, they might lawfully buy a sword to defend their persons against private violence; butMat. 5. 39. c. 10, 17, to 32. Rom. 13. 1, to 7. 1 Pet. 2. 12. to 22. not to re∣sist the publike Authority of persecuting Princes, or revenge themselves. 3ly. That the Disciples misapprehending Christs meaning, imagining he commanded each of them personally to buy a sword to defend him from the band of men armed with swords, staves, that should apprehend and put him to death, they in their simplicity thought two swords sufficient to effect it, when as not twelve, nor two hundred swords, much lesse two, would be sufficient for that purpose; Whereupon he replied, It is enough: either by way of Ironie, as some hold; Dominus ironia dixit; Quia duo gla∣dii sunt, omnino multi sunt, & sufficiunt nobis contra multitudinem quae venit super nos: Or else rather by way of diversion to some other discourse, asTheophylacti in Lucam E∣narratio, c. 22. p. 203, 204. Tho. Aquinas Catena in Lo∣cum Theophylact thinks! Haec enim opinor aenigmaticè propterea dicebat, ut postea recordantes & intelligentes, utilitatē capiant, quoniam tunc adeo insipientes erant, ut dicunt: Domine hic duo gladii, at ipse quia vidit ipsos non intellexisse, inquit, Satis est: tametsi nequaquam sufficerent, si hu∣mano auxilio contra honicidas illos uti oportuisset; neque omnium gladii sufficissent: si autem hoc oluissent, & diviniore subsidio opus erat, superstui fuissent & duo. Verunta∣men Dominus noluit eos arguere, utpote nihil intelligentes, sed dixit, satis est: & processit. Sic igitur etiam nos quando cum quodam conversantes vidimus cum non intellexisse quid diximus, dicimus; Bene, dimitte; quamvis non sit bonum; sed ne conturbaremus, re∣mittimus. Facit hic Dominus quando videt discipulos non intelligere dictum; transit, & eventum rerum explicare dictorum intelligentiam, &c. 4ly. That Christ by this re∣ply, It is enough, expressed his own willingnesse to suffer death, without the least re∣sistance by his Apostles swords, orCompared with Mat. 26. 48, to 59. Isay 53. 7. Acts 8. 32. any other human or angelical power, and that he would make use of neither of them to prevent his apprehension or crucifixion. Duo gladii sufficiunt ad testimonium spontè passi Salvatoris: Ʋnus qui & Apostolis audaciam pro Domino certandi, & avulsaictu ejus auricula (Malchi) Domino etiam morituro pieta∣tem virtutemque doceret inesse medicandi. Alter qui nequaqam vagina exemptus, osten∣deret eos, ne totum quod potuere pro ejus defesione facere permissos; as our Venerable w Beda expounds these words, living about 750 years after Christ, and Hugo Cardi∣nalis, Stella, besides others since: 5ly.In Evang. Lucae, l. 6. c. 22. Tom. 5. p. 428. Chryso∣stom, Hom. 85. in Mat. Origen,Hom. 7. in Mat. Lyra in Lucam l. 10. Ambrose,Aquinatis Catena in Lo∣cum. St. Chrysostom, with other Antients, Erasmus in his Paraphrase on Luke 22. & Oecolampadius in Mat. c. 26 conclude from hence, and from Christs command to Peter, Put up thy sword into its place, &c. That it is unlawfull for Christians under the Gospel to wage warre; since two swords are enough for Christs disciples to defend themselves withall, even in times of per∣secution, without an offensive or defensive army, which requires thousands of swords, not two: YeaSixtus Senen∣sis Bibl. l. 6. Annot. 156, to 158. Sixtus Senensis himself, who differs from them in opinion, confesseth, that exordio nascentis Ecclesiae, armorumusus minimè conveniret. Whence Christ pro∣hibited his Apostles so much as to takeLuke 9. 2. Mat. 10. 10. two staves, much lesse two swords, to defend themselves, or offend others. FinallyIn Lu. 22. v. 38. Maldonat, and CardinalDe Romano Pontifice l. 5. c. 5. Bellarmine in this our age are forced to confesse, That these two swords and the Popes Titles to them cannot be literally deduced from this Text; & Mr. Calvin concludes,In Luc. 22. & Marlorat ibi∣dem. Quod hinc eliciunt Canonistae, cornutos suos Episcopos duplici Jurisdictione esse praeditos, non solum putida est allegoria, sed protervum ludibrium quo verbo Dei insultant Antichristi mancipia. Where∣fore
letHere p. 63. Popes and their Parasites for the future evince their pretended divine Right to the two Temporal and Spiritual swords of Supream Coercive Power over all Em∣perors, Kings, Princes, Churches, and Pope Hildebrands and his Successors arming many thousands of souldiers with swords against Henry the 3, 4, 5. Frederick and o∣ther Christian Kings, Princes, and their slaughters of Millions of Christians to wrest these Swords out of their hands, and keep them in their own with meer armed force, by better arguments then any yet produced from this Text, or else for ever renounce their distinction of, and Title to these two swords, with these Thrasonical Paradoxes vented in that age byPetrus Ble∣sensis Tract. de Hierosolymita∣na Peregtina∣tione accele∣randa, Bibl.

Arnolphum qui magna nominis celebritate, magnoque mortalium concursa divinam praedicabat legem, quia eorum vitam increpabat, impie necarunt. He subjoynes, Tulit id facinus Honorius iniquo animo, caeterum quaestione abstinu∣it. Therefore doubtlesse he assented to it; qui tacet consentire videtur. St. Bernard Abbot of Clarevall flourishing in that age,Anno 1130. upon this occasion (as I suppose) thus declaimed against the Prelates persecution, Tyranny,De Conver∣sione Pauli, Sermo 1. 1. 20. Videatur jam Ecclesiae persecutionis tempus, sed ut palam factum est, nunquam deest persecutio Christianis, sed neque Christo: & nunc, quod gravins est, ipsum Christum persequun∣tur, qui ab eo utique Christiani dicuntur. Amici tui Deus & proximi adversum te appropinquaverunt & steterunt. Conjurasse videtur contra te Vniversitas populi Christiani a minimo usque ad maximum; a planta pedis usque ad verticem, non est sanitas ulla: egressus est iniquitas a Senioribus, Iudicibus et Vicarus tuis, qui videntur regere populū tuū. Non est jam dicere,
ut populus, sic sacerdos, quia nec sic populus ut sacerdos. Heu, heu, Domine Deus quia ipsi sunt in persecutione tua primi, qui videntur in Ec∣clesia tua Primatum diligere, gerere Principatum. Arcem Syon apprehenderunt; munitiones & universam deinceps libere & potestativè tradunt incendio Civitatem (He alludes to Pope Calixtus conquest of the Emperor, and wresting Inve∣stitures and Ecclesiastical preferment out of his hands, under pretext of Simony, that he and his successors might bestow them gratis on the best deserving Clergymen; but it fell out quite contrary, as his next words import) Misera eorum conversatio ple∣bis tuae miserabilis subversio est, atque utinam hac parte sola nocerent. Esset fortè qui Domi∣nica praemonitus & praemunitus exhortatione, daret operam ipsorum non exempla imitari, sed observare praecepta,Mat. 24. juxta illud; Quae dicunt facite, & ad opera eorum nolite respicere. Nunc autem dati sunt sacri Gradus in occasionem turpis lucri, et quaestum aestimant pietatem. Copiosissimae si quidem pietatis in∣veniuntur in suscipienda, immo accipienda magis animarum Cu∣ra, sed haec apud eos cura minor, et de animarum salute novissima cogitatio est; An vero Salvatori animarum gravior ulla esse poterat persecutio? Inique agunt & caeteri contra Christum; multique sunt nostris temporidus Antichristi. Meriò tamea & crudeliorem eam censct persecutionem, pro acceptis beneficiis, & gravi∣orem sentit pro potestate quàm propriis sustinet à Ministris: licet alii quoque multi con∣tra proximorum salutem multiphariè multisque modis & variis occasionibus agere vide∣antur: Agnoscite dilectissimi & expavescite consortia eorum qui suggestione maligna, ex∣emplo pernicioso, scandali occasione salutem impediunt animarum. Horrendum penitus This is the  Sacrilege, which the Popes, Bishops, Priests were most guilty of; Sacrilegium, quod & ipsorum videtur excedere facinus quo Domino Majestatis manus Sacrilegos injecerunt. Haec videt Christus, & silet: Haec Salvator patitur, & dissimulat. Proptere dissimulemus nos quoque necesse est & sileamus interim, maximeque de Praelatis nostris magistris Ecclesiarum. Sic nimirum, sic placet, et impiis ut evadant nunc humana judicia, veniatque semel ejudi∣cium grave his qui praesunt, et potentes patiantur tormenta po∣tenter. How corrupt, unjust, and dishonourable this Pope Honorius and the Court of Rome were in their proceedings, St. Bernard thus informed both himself and the world in several of his Epistles to him and Haimericus Chancellor of the Roman See. Epistola 46. Summo Pontifici Honorio, pauperum Christi Abbates, Hugo de Pontiniaco, & Ber∣nardus de Claravalle, quicquid potest peccatorum oratio. Lachrymabilem Episco∣porum, imo totius Ecclesiae querimoniam, nos quoque ejus filii, si tamen digni, dissimulare non possumus. Quae vidimus, loquimur: magna siquidem nos necessitas de claustris ad publicum traxit, ubi & quod loquimur vidimus. Tristes vidimus, tristes eloquimur; honorem Ecclesiae Honorii tempore non minime laesum. Jam Regis flexerat iram humilitas, vel potius constantia Episcoporum, cum ecce a Summo Pontifice summa superveniens auctoritas, heu dejecit constantiam, superbiam statuit. Scimus quidem id vobis per mendacium fuisse surreptum, quod ex vestris literis palam datur adverti, ut everti tam justum, tam∣que necessarium interdictum juberetis. Sed nunquid non vel tandem deprehenso mendacio, mentitum se sentiret iniquitas sibi, & non tantae utique Majestati? Est autem quod miramur; qua nam ratione judicatum sit de parte, abjudica∣tum absenti. Quod tamen non temeraria praesumptione reprehen∣dimus, sed filiali amore, paterno cordi suggerimus, quantum ex hoc et superbit impius, et incenditur pauper. Caeterum quamdiu illum pati, quantumve huic compati debeatis, non est nostrum praescribere vobis. Vos vestra hinc potius dulcissime Pater viscera consulite, Valete. The cause of which complaint is thus related in his next Epistle to this Pope, writtenEpistola 47. ex persona Gaufridi Carnotensis; King Lewes of France, for some pretended misdemeanor, or just cause had seised the Temporalties of the Bishop of Paris, who complaining thereof to the Archbishop of Sienna, and his Suffragans; excepta siquidem tam modesta praedicti Episcopi querimo∣nia, Senonensis Diocesis universi Episcopi, una cum venerabili Metropolitano nostro, as∣citis etiam nobiscum quibusdam aliis Religiosis personis, Regem super gravi injuria per nosipsos humiliter, prout debuimus, convenimus, ut Episcopo, nil quidem tale merito,
su quae tulerat restitueret, rogavimus, nec impetravimus. Sentiens tandem nos ad arma Ecclesiae pro Ecclesia velle confugere, (they interdicting his Land, and threatning to excommunicate him) timuit, annuitque (se omnia redditu∣rum. Sed in eadem forte hora supervenientibus Literis vestris, quibus ejus terram ab interdicto absolvi praecepistis, male in ma∣ium confortatus, quod bene promiserat minime executus est. Die tamen nominata qua id se rursum promisit executurum, ejus nobis conspectui praesen∣tantes, sustinuimus pacem, & non venit, quae sivimus bona, & ecce turbatio. Hoc deni∣que literis vestris factam est, ut male ablata pejus teneantur, et reliqua passim indies rapiantur, eo utique secure quo impune; illa retinentur; Soluto nempe ad vestrum imperium Episcopi justo (ut putamus) interdicto, nostroque, quando parabamus, & quo sperabamus pacem consequi, vestro aeque timore uspenso; interim facti sumus opprobrium vicinis nostris. Quo∣usque, vestrae viderit pietatis compassio. InEpistola 48. 51. two other Epistles he complains how much he was slandered, misrepresent∣ed to this Pope and his Court at Rome, yea persecuted for writing truth to them and doing well; Etiamne pauperi & inopi veritas odium parit, & ne ipsa quidem miseria declinare invidiam potest? Sed hoc viderint fratres vestri, qui contra legem, maledicunt surdo; & maledictum propheticum non verentes, dicunt bonum malum, & malum bo∣num: Quid in me ô boni viri displicuit Paternitati vestrae?Esa. 5 &c. Quousque durat illa sententia,2 Tim. 3. Omnes qui piè volunt vivere in Christo, persecutionem patiuntur? Quousque relinquitur virga peccatoris super sortem justorum? Ʋtinam nuper non esem, ubi vi∣diisem adversum Ecclesiam Apostolica (proh dolor) auctoritate violentam armari tyrannidem, quasi non satis per se insanisset. Tuns demum sensi juxta Prophetam adhaerescere linguam meam palato meo, cum subito pondus superjectum est nostris cervicibus,Psal. 38. atque irrefragabilis auctoritas literarum:Isay 26. Obmutui & humiliatus sum, & dolor meus renovatus est, quoniam vidi repente ad illas literas, impleri facies innocentium ignominia, et laetari amplius impios quod male fecerint, et exultare in his rebus pessimis: Misertum est impio, ut juxta dictum propheticum, non disceret facere ju∣stitiam; & quae in terra sanctorum injusta gessit, ipsius terra justissimo quo tene∣batur absoluta est interdicto, &c. Non tamen me latente et tacen∣te cessare puto murmur Ecclesiarum, si non cesset Romana Curia pro voluntate assistentium facere praejudicium in absentes. Valete. Which he further prosecutes Epist. 49, 50, 51, 52. This holy zealous Abbot St. Bernard, writ, preached, declaimed more frequently and largely against the Usurpations, Temporal, Spiritual Domination, Ambition, Pomp, Pride, Simony, Sacriledge, Lazinesse, Uncleannesse, Sodomy, Bribery, Cor∣ruptions of the Popes, Prelates, Clergy, Court and Church of Rome, then Arnulphus whom they slew, both in hisHere p. 50, 51, 52, 290, 296. forecited Passages, (on which you may reflect) and in his Homilia 4. Supermissus est, De Conversatione ad Clericos, parvi Sermones; Super Cantica Sermo 10, 23, 24, 32, 33, 76, 77. Epistola 42. ad Henricum Senonensem Archiepiscopum, Epist. 48, 51, 78, 87, 91, 125, 126, 132, 152, 164, 168, 169, 176, 178, 178, 185, 189, 210, 219, 234, 235, 236, 299, in his Bookes De Conside∣ratione to Pope Eugenius; in his Sermo ad Clerum in Concilio Rhemensi, ad Pastores Sermo, in Synodo, and other his works. I shall transcribe some Passages of his, that all the world may thereby discover the sad effects of Popes wresting Investitures out of the Emperors and Laymens hands, to engross the disposition of all Ecclesiastical dignities, preferments into their own & Clergies, and their inhibiting Priests marriages produ∣ced; and what ill Bishops, Clergymen they preferred.Sermo 10. & 77. super Can∣ic & in Con∣cilio Rhensi 1 Psal. 1. Serm. 6, & 7. Quatuor his qu praesunt ne∣cessaria. Si reddanda est ratio de his quod quisque gessit in corpore suo: heu quid fiet de his quae quisque gessit in corpore Christi, quod est Ecclesia; Ecclesia Dei vobis commissa est, et dicimini Pastores, cum sitis Rap∣tores. Et paucos habemus heu Pastores, multos autem Excom∣municatores. Et utinam sufficeret vobis lana et lac, sititis enim sanguinem. Quatuor tamen in his qui praesunt in Ecclesia Dei necessaria esse prae om∣nibus reor: videlicet ut perostium intrent, ut in humilitate se contineant, avaritiam de∣clinent: mundiciam tam corde quam corpore servare studeant. Sed quid prodest si cano∣nice eligantur (quod est per ostium intrare) & non canonicè vivant?Joh. 6. Dixit dominus,
ad duodecim, Nonne ego vos duodecim eligi, & unus ex vobis Diabolus est? Do∣mine Jesu cum esset electio illa in manu tua, & non haberes aliquem contradicentem, & re∣clamantem tibi, Quare eligisti Diabolum Episcopum? Cur bone Jesu non eligisti bonum, & justum, & sanctum, sicut Petrus bonus, justus, & sanctus fuit? Vel si eligisti Dia∣bolum, cur te jactas eligisse? Fratres, sic facit Iesus hodie, eligens sibi multos Diabolos Episcopos. Vbi proh dolor! reperiemus Epis∣copos qui post adeptam dignitatem in humilitate se contineant? Nempe superbia eis occasio est ut ad tantam dignitatem aspirent, ut in ovile Christi impudenter irrumpant:Psal. 100. cum tamen per Psalmistam Dominus dicat, Non habitabit in medio domus meae qui facit superbiam. Jesus au∣tem in medio est,Matth. 18 non in angulo. Ʋnde ipse in Evangelio; Ubi duo, inquit, vel tres congregati fuerint in nomine meo, in medio eorum sum. Et iterum, Jesus autem transiens per medium illorum ibat.Luc. 4. Et in Libro Sapientiae, In medio, inquit, Ecclesiae aperuit os ejus.Eccl. 15. Et rursus in Evangelio dicitur; Stetit Jesus in medio Discipulorum suorum.Luc. 24. Ve mihi Domine Jesu si tecum ero in domo tua, & non in medio domus tuae. At isti non sic, sunt quidam cum Jesu; sed non in medio domus ejus, quia amant & faci∣unt superbiam; Parentes suos extollentes, Pauperes autem negligentes, & deprimentes. Male vivunt,Esa. 14. et subjectos male vivere volunt. Et idcirco comparantur Apo∣stati Angelo qui dixii in corde suo, Ponam sedem meam ad aquilonem, &c. Tales fuerunt Scribae & Pharisaei,Mat. 23. contra quos ait Dominus, Vae vobis Scribae & Pharisaei qui clauditis regnum coelorum ante homines, vos enim non intratis & intrountes non si∣nitis introire. Porro Episcopi hujus temporis avaritiam quomodo declinent? Quod enim sine miserabili gemitu dicendum non est, Christi oppro∣bria, sputa, flagelia, clavos, lanceam, crucem, haec omnia fornace avaritiae conflant, et profligant in acquisitionem turpis quaestus, et precium Vniversitatis suis marsupiis includere festinant, hoc so∣lo sane à Juda Ischariote differentes, quod ille horum omne emolumentum denariorum numero compensavit: isti voraciori ingluvie lucrorum infinitas exigunt pecunias. His insatiabili desiderio inhiant, pro his ne amittant, timent; & cum amit: unt dolent. Harū in amore quantum quiescunt duntaxat lib rum est eis arbitriū acervandi vel augmentandi, cura. Animarum nec casus reputatur, nec salus: non sunt profecto ma∣tres, qui cum sint de curcifixi Patrimonio nimium incrassati, impinguati, dilatati, non compatiuntur super contritione Joseph. Archipresbyter circuit obedientiam sibi creditam & ut impleat saccum suum, tradit sanguinem justum. Vendit nempe homicidia, adulteria, incestus, fornicationes, sacrilegia, perjuria, et usque ad summum implet manticam suam. Fama igitur volante innotescit Episcopo, talis quaestus, & accersito Archipresbytero, Da mihi (inqit) partem meam. At illi nihil dabo tibi: è contra Episcopus; si non dederis mihi (inquit) partem meam, auferam tibi omnia. Fitque altercatio maxima, & propter dvaritiam fit discordia, Postea ve∣ro Archipresbyter revolvens secum, quod Authoritate Episcopi fungatur potestate ista; & quod sine gratia ipsius nihil possit (perverse conversus) poenitet inquit me, accipe partem tuam,Luc. 2. & insuper de mea quod beneplacitum fuerit, & reconcilantur. Heu sicut Hero∣des & Pilatus reconciliati sunt; et Christus crucifixus est: sic nihilominus isti re∣conciliantur; & pauperes Christi spoliati sunt. En tempora ista planè foeda a negotio per∣ambulante in tenebris: Quapropter Vae generationi huic a fermento Pharisaeorum, quod est Hypocrisis: si tamen hypocrisis dici debet, quae jam latere prae abundantia non valet, & prae impudentia non querit. Et sic serpit hodie putrida tabes per omne cor∣pus Ecclesiae, quo latius, eo desperatius: eoque periculosius quo intestinius. Nam si insurgeret apertus Haereticus, mitteretur foras & aresceret; si violentus inimicus, absconderet se quis for sitan ab eo. Nunc quomodo ejiciet, aut quomo∣do abscondet se? Omnes amici & Inimiciomnes necessarii, omnes domestici & nulli pa∣cifici. Et quae sua sunt quaerunt omnes.Phil. 2. 21. Ministri Christi sunt, et serviunt Antichristo; honorati incedunt de bonis Domini, cut honorem non deferunt. Unde hic est eis quem quotidie videmus meritricius nitor, Histrionicus habitus, regius ap∣paratus. Inde aurum in froenis, aurum in sellis, & in calcaribus: plus nitent calcaria quàm altaria.Psal. 143. Inde mensae splendidae, & Cibis & Cyphis; Inde commessationes & ebrietates, Inde Cithara & lyra & tibia: redundantia torcularia, & promptuaria plena, erustan∣tia ex hoc in illud. Inde dolia pigmentaria, inde referta marsupia. Hujusmodi sunt
et volunt esse, Ecclesiarum Praepositi, Decani, Episcopi, et Archi∣episcopi. Nec enim haec merito cedunt, sed negotio illi, quod perambulat in tenebris. O∣lim praedictum est,Esa 21. & nunc tempus impletionis advenit, Ecce in pace amaritudo mea amarissima. Amara prius in nece Martyrum, amarior post in conflictu Haereticorum, ama∣rissima nunc in moribus Domesticorum. Non fugari, non exterminari possunt, ita invaluorunt,Esa. 21. ita multiplicati sunt super numerum. Intestina, & insanabilis enim plaga Ecclesiae,Psal. 39. & ideo in pace amaritudo mea amarissima. Sed in qua pace? Pax est, & non est Pax:Isa. 1 Pax a Paganis, Pax ab Haereticis, sed non profecto a filiis. Vox plangentis in tempore Israel,Job 40. Filios enutrivi & exaltavi, ipsi aut spreverunt me. Spreverunt et invaluerunt a turpi vita, a turpi quaestu, a turpi commercio, a ne∣gotio perambulante in tenebris: Superest ut jam de medio fiat demonium me∣ridianum ad seducendos si qui in Christo residui sunt, adhuc persistentes in simplicitate sua, siquidem absorbuit fluvios sapientum, & torrentes potentum, Et habet fiduciam quod influ∣at Jordanis in os ejus, i. humiles & simplices qui sunt in Ecclesia, Ipse enim est Anti∣christus, 2 Thess. 2. qui non solum se diem, sed & meridiem mentitur, & extollitur supra id quod colitur, ut Deus, quem dominus Jesus interficiet Spiritu oris sui, & destruet illum illustra∣tione adventus sui. Ecce diximus quales habemus Pastores in via hac qua ambulamus, non quales habere opus. Non sunt omnes amici sponsi, qui hodie sponsi sunt Ecclesiae. Hinc inde assistre cernuntur,Phil. 2. & vulgo aiunt eam quasi addrextrare videntur. Pauci ad∣modum sunt qui quae sua sunt, non quaerunt, ex omnibus Charis ejus. Diligunt mu∣nera, nec possunt pariter diligere Christum, quia manus dederunt Mammonae, Intuere quommodo incedunt, nitidi & ornati, circumamicti varietate tanquam sponsa procedens de thalamo suo. Nonne si quempiam talium repentè eminus pro∣cedentem assexeris, sponsam potius putabis quàm sponsae custodem? Unde vero hanc illis, exuberare aestimes rerum affluentiam, vestium splendorem, mensarum luxuriam, congeri∣em vasorum argenteorum & aureorum, nisi de bonis sponsi? Inter haec est quod illa pau∣per, et inops, et nuda relinquitur facie miseranda, inculta, hispida et exanguis: propter hoc non est hoc tempore ornare sponsam, sed spoliare; non est custodire, sed perdere; non est defendere, sed expo∣nere; Psalm 5. non est instruere, sed prostituere; non est pascere gregem Do∣mini, Psalm 78. sed mactare, et devorare; dicente Domino de illis, qui devo∣rant plebem meam ut cibum panis:Ose 4. & iterum, quia commederunt Jacob & locum ejus desolverunt, peccata populi commedent, quasi dicat; peccatorum precia exigunt, et peccantibus sollicitudinem non impendunt. Quem dabis mihi de numero Episcoporum, qui non plus invigilet subditorum eva∣cuandis marsupiis, quam vitiis extipandis? Vbi est qui flectat i∣ram? Vbi est qui praedicet annum placabilem domino? Propterea re∣stnquamus istos, qui non sunt Pastores sed Traditores, et imitemur il∣los qui viventes in Carne, plantaverunt Ecclesiam sanguine suo. Et quidem isti sortiti sunt Ministerii locum, sed non Zelum; successores omnes cu∣piunt esse, imitatores pauci; utinam tam vigiles reperirentur ad Cu∣ram, quam alacres currunt ad Cathedram; vigilarent utique sol∣licite servantes sibi creditam Ecclesiam. Immo vero vigilarent pro se∣metipsis nec sinerent de se dici, amici mei & proximi mei adversum me appropinqua∣verunt & steterunt. Iusta omnino querimonia, nec ad ullum justius quam ad nostram referenda aetatem; Parum est nostris Pastori∣bus quod non servant nos, nisi et perdant: Graviter quippe dimersi ob∣livionis somnio ad nullum dominicae comminationis tonitruum expergiscuntur, ut vel suum ipsorum periculum expavescant: inde est quod non parcant suis, qui non parcunt sibi: perimen∣tes pariter & pereuntes. After which he relates their unclean, Sodomitical practises, which IHere, p. 290, 291, 292, 293. formerly touched, and shall not here repeat. In another place he thus complains of the ambition, avarice, depravation of the Clergy, & Court of Rome in that age.Epistola. 42. Nunc verò quia sola attenditur gloria, & non poena, purum esse clericum erubescitur in Ecclesia, seque viles aestimant & inglorii, qui quocunque eminentiori in loco non fuerint sublimati: Scholares pueri, & impuberes adoles∣centuli ob sanguinis dignitatem, & de sub ferula transferuntur ad principandum Presby∣teris, laetiores interim quod virgas evaserint, quàm quod meruerint principatum, nec tam
illis blanditur adeptum, quàm ademptum Magisterium: Et hoc quidem in initio. Pro∣cessu vero temporis paulatim insolescentes, docti sunt in brevi vendicare altaria, subdito∣rum marsupia vacuare, Magistris nimirum in hac disciplina utentes idoncis, ambi∣tione et avaritia. Verum quantavis industria tua tibi lucra conquirere cautulus vi∣dearis, quantalibet vigilantia rem possis servaretuam, quantecunque studio Regum tibi ac Pincipum gratiam captare cures,Ecci. 10. dicimus tamen, Vae terrae cujus Rex est puer, & cu∣jus Principes mane comedunt: Caeterum curritur in Clero, passim ab omni aetate & or∣dinè, à doctis pariter & indectis, ad Ecclesiasticas Curas, tanquam sine curis jam quisque victurus sit, cum ad curas pervenerit. Nec mirum de his qui necdum in semetipsis experti sunt. Videntes quippe illos qui jam proprios humeros cupitae sarcinae summiserunt, non solum non gemere tanquam sub onere, sed insuper appetere plus onerari, non deterrentur periculis, qui cupiditate caecati non vidnt, sed favoribus amplius quos illis invident provocantur. O Infinita semper Ambitio, et insatiabilis avaritia! Cum primos honorum gradus meruerint in Ecclesia, meruerint, autem vel vitae meri∣to vel pecunicae, sive etiam carnis et sangunis, quae regnum Dei non posside∣bunt, praerogativa, non ideo Corda quiescunt, duplici semper aestu∣antia desiderio, quo utique magis ac magis et dilatenturIs not this their Genius, Practise ever since, & now? in plu∣ra, et ad celsiora sublimentur. Verbi gratia, cum factus quis fue∣rit in quacunque Ecclesia Decanus, Praepositus, Archidiaconus, aut aliquid hujusmodi, non contentus uno in una, plures sibi immo quotquot valet conquirere honores satagit, tam in una quam in plu∣ribus. Quibus tamen omnibus si locus evenerit, libenter unius praeferet Episcopi dignitatem; Sed nunquid sic satiabitur? Factus Episcopus, Archiepiscopus esse desiderat. Quo fortè adepto, rursum nescio quid altius somnians, laboriosis itineribus, et sumptuosis fami∣liaritatibus Romanum statuit frequentare palatium, questuosas sibi quasdam exinde comparans amicitias. Si Lucri Spiritualis gratia haec faciunt, laudandus est zelus, sed praesumptio corrigenda. Nonnulli cum ista non possint, vertunt se ad aliud ambiendi genus, in quo nihilominus aperiunt eam quam ha∣bent dominaudi libidinem. Nam cum praesident Ʋrbibus valdè populosis, & totas, ut ita dicam patrias propriae Diocasis ambitu cincumcludunt, occasione inventa, ex quocunque veteri privilegio, satis agunt, ut et vicinas sibi subjiciant. Civitates, quatenus duae, quibus duo vix praesules sufficiebant, sub uno redigantur Antistite. Regi quae haec tam odiosa praesumptio? Quis hic tantus ardor dominandi super terram? quae principandi, tam effrenis cupiditas? Certè cum primum tractus es ad Cathedram, flebas, refugie∣bas, vim querebaris: multum ad te, & omnino supra te esse dicens, miserum clamitans & indignum, qui non esse idoneus tam Sancto Ministerio, tantis non sufficeres curis: Quid igitur nunc verecunda depulsa formidine, sponte ambis ad ampliora, immo irreverenti audacia, propriis non contentus inva∣dis aliena? Cur hoc? Fortè ut plures populos salves? Sed in alienam messem tuam mittere falcem injuriosum est. Vt tuae praestes Ecclesiae? Sed Ecclesia∣rum sponso non placet tale unius incrementum quod sit detrimen∣tum alterius. Crudelis ambitio, & incredibilis, si fidem oculi non astruerent: Vix tenent manus quin illud ad literam impleant, quod logitur in Propheta, Secuerunt preg∣nantes Galaad,Esai. 5. ad dilatandum terminos suos. Ʋbi est illa terrifica comminatio, Vae qui conjungitis domum ad domum, & agrum agro copulatis: Nunquid in his dun∣taxat exiguis, vae istud metuendum est, non autem cum Vrbes Vrbibus, aut Provinciae Provinciis continuantur? Immò, etiam respondeant si imitari Dominum Christum; facientes & ipsi utraque unum adducentes, & ipsi ex di∣versis pascuis greges,Eph. 2. Ut fiat unus pastor, & unum ovile. Hujus rei gratia, non pigri∣tantur crebro terere limina Apostolorum,Joann. 10. 16 inventuri et ibi quod ma∣gis dolendum est, qui suae faveant improbae voluntati: non quod valde Romani curent, quo fine res terminetur; sed quia valde diligunt munera, sequuntur retributiones. Nude nuda loquor, nec re∣tego verecunda, sed inverecunda confuto. Utinam privatim & in Cameris haec sierent,
Utinam soli viderimus & audierin us, Utinam nec loquentibus crederetur, Utinam nobis reliquerint moderni Noae unde à Nobis possent aliquaetenus operiri. Nunc vero cer∣nente Orbe mundi fabulam soli tacebimus? He elsewhere thus seconds this complaint,In Psal. 91. Sermo 6. Ipsa quoque Ecclesiasticae dignitatis of∣ficia in turpem quaestum & tenebrarum negotium transière, nec in his salus animarum, sed luxus qua ritur divitnarum. Propter hoc tondentur, propter hoc frequentant Ecclesi∣as, Missas celebrant, Psalmos decantant. Pro Episcopatibus et Archidiacona∣tibus et Abbatiis, aliisque dignitatibus hodie impudenter decerta∣tur, ut Ecclesiarum redditus in superfluitatis et vanitatis usus dis∣sipentur. perest ut reveletur homo peccati, filius perditionis, daemonium non modo diurnum sed & meridianum; quod non solum transfiguretur in Angelorum lucis,2 Thess. 2. sed extollitur super omne quod dicitur Deus, aut quod colitur. Nimirum insidiatur crudelius calcaneo matris Ecclesiae, â qua dolet caput suum esse contri∣tum. Hic planè gravissimus erit incursus, sed ob hoc quoque Ecclesiam Electo∣rum veritas liberabit propter eos brevians dies.Epistola 42. ad Henricum Senonensem Archiepiscopum  Tim. 2. Cernitur in nonnullis Sacerdotibus vestium cultus plurimus, virtutum aut nullus, aut exiguus. Quibus ego si rememorarem illud Apostolicum, non in veste preciosa, vereor ne indignentur: dum nimirum indignum ducant in se assuptam sententiam, quàm prius in viliorem sexum & ordinem prolata fuisse, recognoverint, Quasi vero non eodem utantur medici ferro secandis regibus quo & popu∣laribus hominibus, aut capiti fiat injuria, si ipsis forcipibus capilli excrescentes detonde∣antur, quibus & unguium fuer intresecata superflua. Attamen si dedignantur pari cum mulierculis, non quidem à me, sed ab Apostolo feriri sententia; dedignentur & cum ip∣sis eadem involvi culpa. Despiciant jam textricum sive pellificum, & non propriis ope∣ribus gloriari. Horreant et murium rubricatas pelliculas, quas gulas vocant, manibus circundare sacratis, & sacrantibus tremenda mysteria. Respuant & apponere pectori quod decentius ornat gemma sapientiae, Pudeat & Collo circumtexere quod honestius at∣que suavius Christi jugo submittitur: Non Christi stigmata sunt haec, quae isti Mar∣tyrum exemplo circumferant in corpore suo.

Ad Dominum Papam Innocentium in persona Alberonis, Treverensis Archiepis∣copi, he complains, Suffraganeos accepi juvenes & nobiles: adjutores esse deberent, et utinam non adversarentur. Sed supersedeo: Dico tamen Ius, fas, honestas, religio in nostris Episcopatibus perierunt; to wit, among the Bishops and Clergy, of whom he thus complained to the Pope, without any hopes of redresse. I pretermit hisSee Epist. 158, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168. other passages against the Corruption, Simony, Sacri∣ledge, Ambition, Pomp, Pride, Lazinesse, Uncharitablenesse, Luxury, Unclean∣nesse, Bribery, and Atheistical lives of the Roman Court, Prelates, Clergy in that age, when Popes and Popish Prelates had the sole election, preferment, cor∣rection of them; yet would not suffer Monks or Laymen so much as to reprehend, much lesse to correct their persons or vices. After the death of Pope Honorius (to whom St. Bernard writ severalEpist. 13, 14, 46, 47, 49, 50. Epistles) Anno Dom. 1130. there arose a Great Schisme in the Church about the election of a New Pope; some of the Cardinals electing Gregory Cardinal of St. Angelo, who assumed the name of Innocent the 2. against the Romans consents: who presently ta∣king up arms against Rogerius Duke of Sicily and Normandy (stilingSigeberti Continuator Otto Frisin∣gensis, l. 7. c. 27 28.

He to establish himself in St. Peters Chair, seised upon the gold or silver Crowns, Crosses, Crucifixes, Vessels, Ornaments of the Church, & melting
them into coyn distributed the mony among the Romans, wherby he so obliged them to him, that Innocent after his release out of prison, thought it not safe to stay at Rome, but taking ship with his Cardinals passed over to Pisa, and there excommunicated Anacletus. From thence sending a Legate to Ludovicus Crassus King of France, to relate the equity of his cause, desired he might be there received as Pope; the French Bishops being doubtfull, to which of these Popes they should adhere, some of them siding with Anacletus against Innocent; thereupon a Council was held at Stamps, where (by St. Bernards means, who stickled for Innocent, and writ manyBernardi E∣pist. 124, to 133, 139, 140, 150, 76. Bernardi Vita l. 2. c. 1, 2. Epistles to Kings, Princes, Bishops in his behalf) Innocent was received as Pope. After which he posted into Germany to Lotharius, where a Council of Bishops was called at Leodium, which received him as Pope; engaging Lotharius the Emperor by Oath to restore him, if he would crown him Emperor. After which returning into France, having by St. Bernards Epistles, travel, mediation, engaged the Kings of Germany, England, Scotland, Spaine, Jerusalem, to receive him as lawfull Pope, he held several Coun∣cils at Rhemes, Placentia, Pisa, and Claremount, wherein heCent. Magd. 12. col. 1032. solemnly excommunica∣ted, anathematized Anacletus and all his adherents with horrible execrations. St. Bernard in his 125. Epistle renders this account of these two Popes ele∣ctions and proceedings, ad Magistrum Galfridum de Loratorio; Tu tibi quiescis, & mater tua Ecclesia graviter conturbatur: habuit sua tempora quies, & sanctum otium ha∣ctenus sua negotia licenter, libenterque exercuit: Tempus faciendi nunc, quia dissipa∣verunt legem: Bestia illa de Apocalypsi,Psal. 118. cui datum est os loquens blasphemias, & bellum genere cum Sanctis,Antichrist may possesse S.

Epistle ad Lotharium Imperatorem, in this Popes behalf, is very observable; Lothario Dei Gratia Romano Imperatori Augusto, B. Abbas Claravallae, si quid po∣test peccatoris oratio. Benedictus Deus qui vos elegit, et erexit cornu salutis nobis, ad laudem et gloriam nominis sui, et reparandum Imperii decus: ad subveniendum Ecclesiae suae in tempore malo: postremo ad operandum etiam nunc salutem in medio terrae. Ipsius est enim opus quod Corona Gloriae vestrae ita indies ampliatur, & sublimatur, mirabiliter crescens ac proficiens in omni decore, & magnificentia apud Deum & homines. Ipsius profectò nuper opus & virtus fuit, quod iter satis laboriosum & meticulosum pro pace Regni, & Ecclesiae liberatione susceptum in tanta prosperitate peregistis. Romae siquidem Im∣perialis culminis plenitudinem gloriosissimè assecutus. Idque quod majus fuit in manu non magna, ut animi fideique magnitudo clarius emineret. Quod si ante tantillum exercicum terra tremit & quievit: quantus patamus horror hostium cor∣da invadere habeat, cum coeperit Rex procedere in magnitudine brachii sui? Ani∣mabit insuper honestas causae, immo duplex provocabit necessitas. Non est meum hortari ad pugnam, est tamen (securus dico) advocati Ecclesiae, ab Ecclesiae infe∣statione schismaticorum rabiem, est Caesaris proprium vendicare Coronam ab usurpatore Siculo. Vt enim constat Iudaicam sobolem sedem Petri in Christi occupasse injuriam; sic proculdubio omnis qui in Sicilia Regem se facit, contradicit Caesari. Si autem utrum∣que incumbit Caesari, restituere scilicet Caesari quae sunt Caesaris, & quae sunt Dei Deo; (Therefore by St. Bernards Verdict, Siciliy is the Emperors, not St. Peters or the Popes Patrimony.) Cur apud Tullum res Dei minuitur, cum Caesar nihil ibi lucretur? Verendum est ne minimorum neglectus, impedimentum sit maximo∣rum. Hoc est quod dico, Ecclesia Sancti Gegulfi graviter injusteque (ut dicitur) in illa Civitate opprimitur, & aiunt vestrae prudentiae nescio qua fraude subreptum, ut Domino Papae per justitiam subvenire paranti vestrae interventu precis obviare∣tis, obsecro & consulo consultius agi, noxiam revocari precem; dari locum justi∣tiae, antequam Ecclesia illa funditus destruatur. Pauper sum ego, fidelis tamen vester. Et si video Importunus, fortasis inde est: The History of Pope Innocents and Anacletus schismes,Carolus Sigo∣nius de Regno Italiae, l. 11. p. 261, 262, 263. See Bernardi vita, l. 2. c. 1, 2 elections, contests, pro∣ceedings, wars against each other is thus related at large to Posterity by Carolus Sigo∣nius, more exactly than by any other Historian. Mortuo Honorio postridie Cardinales cum Clero convenerunt, ac relatione de novo substituendo Pontifice facta, alii alio sua studia contulêrunt. Major pars, ea∣que integrior, Gregorium Johannis Vidonis filium ex Canonico regulari Cardinalem, vitae, aetatis, ut prudentiae gravitate, illo honore dignissimum legit, eumque Inno∣centium
secundum vocavit; minor eaque corruptior Petrum, Petri Leonis filium, ex Clerico Cardinalem, omnibus his laudibus omnium judicio inferiorem renunciavit, ac Superioribus fustra renitentibus, festinanter atque astute consecratum, Anacleti secundi nomine insignivit. Innocentius per Ostioensem Episcopum legitimè consecra∣tus ac moderatè à suis per omnia loca, in quibus ex antiquo instituto Sessiones ipsi habent Pontifices, circumductus, demum, legitimam Lateram sedem inivit. Uter∣que Civis Romanus erat; verùm Nobilitas in Petro major & spes pramiorum uberior, multo plures ad eum venerandum illexit. Itaque Petri sive Anacleti parte in urbe fuerente, atque Innocentio, & fautoribus ejus terrorem ac periculum intentante, Innocentius timuit, atque unà cum Cardinalibus suis ad Fragipanes amicos accestit, ho∣mines tum in urbe insigni potentia ac nobilitate florentes, & in eorum turribus salu∣tem tueri suam contendit. Anacletus ad pecumam, quam ex Patrimonii magnitudine, & negotiis Domini Ecclesiae gestis coacervatam habebat, simul etiam quoque nefarie comparavit;Nota Siquidem occupata Vaticana D. Petri Basilica coronas, calices & cruci∣fixos aureos, ac ciborium, quod Leo construxerat, sustulit, itemque alia opulenta urbis Tempia donariis pretiosissimis spoliavit, atque auro conflato ingentem in pecu∣niae summam redegit, quam cum plebi distribuisset, facilè quod reliquum populi erat, ab Innocentio avocavit. Itaque Populus Romanus pravis illebris Anacleti corruptus, Innocentium ac Cardinales partemque ejus non solum probris & convitiis petere, sed etiam manu, telisque incessere institit. Quibus malis cum resistere se non posse Innocentius cerneret, sibi urbe cedendum existimavit, ac relicto in Laterano Conra∣do Sabinensi Episcopo, paratis occulte navigiis secundo Tiberi cum Cardinalibus suis ad mare, atque inde duabus Pisanorum triremibus Pisas accessit. Exceptus a Pisanis tantis studiis, quantis verum excipi Pontificem decuit. Ibi proximorum Episcopo∣rum conventu habito Anacletum partem{que} ejus devovit, atque Henricum Patriarcham Gradensem designatum consecravit, ac pallio insignivit. Interim Legati ab eo in Franciam missi Ludovicum Regem, ac populos Francorum de jusstis ipsius Comitiis docuerunt, eosque ad complectendum Innocentium adhortati sunt. Haerente autem con∣silio, Ludovicus, & Episcopi, Concilium Stampis habuere, at{que} eo praecipuè Bernardum Abbatem Cluravallensem maximè tunc propter creditam sanctitatem authoritatis homi∣nem accivere. Ibi utrius{que} Pontificis comitia accuratissimè sunt discussa. Bernardo vero Innocentii causam graviter ac copiosè agente, haud aegrè & Rex, & Episcopi omnes In∣nocentio subscripsêre, ac missis ad Innocentium nunciis ipsum in Franciam vocavêre. Ita Innocentius rebus satis in Etruria constitutis, gratiis Pisanis actis Franciam versus accessit. Ex itinere cum Genuam attigisset à Civitate honorifice exceptus Syrum Novum urbis Episcopum consecravit, atque inter eos & Pisanos inducias usque ad suam reversionem composuit. Profectus indè Genua ad littus Provinciae accessit, & per Decembrem men∣sem alterum Claramonte conventum habuit, atque iterum Anacletum et fautores ejus damnavit. Dum haec ab Innocenti administrantur, Anacletus, qui solus in urbe remanserat, et ipse partem adversam infligendis Anathematis institit preme∣re, et ad causam suam amicos quam plurimos potuit aggregare. Praecipuè autem Anselmus Mediolonensis Archiepiscopus, ab Honorio Conradi causa devotus, ei se tradidit, atque una secum populum Mediolanensem, ac plerosque Lombardiae Episcopos traxit. Quin etiam Rogerius Siciliae Comes, atque Apuliae & Calubriae, cum Roberto Principe Capuano ad Innocentium Pisas profecto, per arma Principatum eripuisset omnes ditionis suae Proceres ad Anacletum traduxit. Ejus ve∣rò facti haec ratio fuit. Rogerius cum Sicilia, Calabria, Apuleaque potitus, se opibus ad tuendam regiae Majestatis titulum satis instructum videret, nec tam latè patentem potentiam, exiguitate nominis coarctandam existimaret, ultrò se Regem Siciliae nuper appellare nulla Pontificia authoritate inceperat. Quod cum vulgo improbari sentiret, occasionem idoneam nactus ad Anacletum accessit, & se cum suis Episcopis complexurum, si se Regem appellaret, ostendit. Anacletus optatissimam occasionem adeptus, avidè arripuit, ac re composita, Beneventum profectus 5. Calendas Octob. ipsum praesentem Siliciae Regem, Apuliae, Calabriaeque Ducem, Capuaeque Principem declaravit, ac feudatarium, sive hominem, ut vocabant, ligium Ecclesiae confirmavit. Ah illo die Episcopi Abbatesque ulterioris Italiae,See Chroni∣con Cassinen∣si, l. 4. c. 105, 106. Centur. Magd. 12. c. 8. col. 1149, to 1166. in primisque Seniorietus Abbas Cassinas, Anacsetum, ut justum Pontificem coluerunt. Qua ex re maxima Ecclesiae Italiae incommoda perceperunt. Being divided against each other in Civil wars by reason of the Schisme between these Popes, and subjected to the forces and invasi∣ons of Lotharius the Emperor who assisted Pope Innocent.
Anno Domini 1131. Innocentius Claremonte profectus per Burgundiam Aurea∣nam venit ab Episcopis,Anno 1131. & Ludovico Rege obviam progressus exceptus,See Vita Bernardi, l. 2 c. 1, 2. ac legitime cultus; Inde à Gaufrido Carnotensi Episcopo Carnotum adductus Henricum Anglorum Regem, cum maximo Episcoporum, Principiumque suorum Comitatu obviam habu∣it. Eo vero invitis Episcopis suis Innocentium recipere non audente, Ber∣nardus qui aderat, Quid haesitas? inquit, anne Deo displiceas, & piaculum con∣trahas? cogita de aliis peccatis tuis quid ei respondeas. Istud vero fac mihi relinquas Atque ita illum ad colendum Innocentium impulit. Reversus inde Gerardus Cardina∣lis à Lothario Rege Germaniae, quem Natalicia Gandersheim celebrantem, Innocen∣tii jussu convenerat, bonum ejus erga Innocentium animum retulit, ac praesto ad Leodium fore nunciavit. Quo nuncio erectior ipse factus, haud tamen in praesens Leodium voluit adire, verum Franciam ante, postulantibus ita populis, perlustrare. Itaque praesente Ludovico 14 Kalend. Novembris Concilium Remis frequentissimum habuit in quo Anacletum deintegro condemnavit, ac Ludovicum juvenem Lu∣dovici filium,Anno 2132, Regia Franciae Corona 7 Kalendas ornavit. Sequenti Anno Innocen∣tius Leodium prodiit. Atque eodem quoque Lotharius cum omnibus Sacris, & pro∣fanis Regni sui proceribus, & universa Germaniae nobilitate occurrit. Ibi Innocentius à Rege, caeterisque eximii cultus Conventum celeberrimum habuit; in quo sacras adversus Anacletum detestationes redintegravit, ac Lotharium ad se Ecclesi∣amque tuendam honesto Othonis Magni, & posterorum ejus exemplo hortatus est. Lotharius se nullo ei tempore defuturum respondit, si ipse sibi antiquum jus con∣ferendorum sacerdotiorum, cui nuper Henricus renunciarat, con∣cederet; Nam Imperium plurimum eo vectigali subtracto ad gra∣via pro Ecclesia sustinenda bella detrimenti caepisse. Qua voce audita graviter perculsi Cardinalium animi sunt, ut qui se tristiorem in Germania ipsis Ec∣clesiae rebus fortunam reperisse viderentur, quam Romae reliquissent, si eo sibi jure cedendum esset, quod ipsi nuper tanto sudore ac sanguine vix tan∣dem Ecclesiae peperissent. Tum Bernardus qui ab Innocentii latere nunquam discessit, Petitionem ejus iniquam, atque alienam esse docere, neque ipsum petisse sedWas not this true of the Popes Prede∣cessors, who had wrested it from the Em∣perors by force? extorsisse tempore iniquioris fortunae captato, judicaturos homines esse oporte∣re eum, ut genere, sic studio à Gebellinis differre, qui pravum exemplum ut venden∣dorum sacerdotiorum, sic oppugnandae Ecclesiae induxissent, eundem omnem dissi∣dii inter Imperium, atque Ecclesiam tollere occasionem debere, ne diuturna con∣certandi consuetudo Christianorum in duas factiones studia distrahat. Quod si quan∣do eveniat profectò non sine ingenti pernicie omnium eventurum. Haec ipsa non aliter atque si ex oraculo edita essent, facile prudentem piumque Regem de sen∣tentia deturbarunt, pollicitusque est, se Innocentium Romam cum exer∣citu reducturum, atque Anacleto exacto incolumem in Laterano collocaturum, si ipse sibi Imperatorium diadema sponderet. Quod cum Innocentius promisisset, & rei perficiendae consilium satis, ut in praesentia, constitisset, Leodio abiit; ac Monaste∣rio Bernardi Claravallae lustrato sese in Italiam retulit, ac Genuam reversus ibi Lotha∣rii adventum sibi expectandum esse constituit. Eodem Anno Mediolanenses (in defence of Anacletus his title against Innocent) iterum adversus Papienses moverunt, ac Prae∣lio magno ad Martinengum facto eos ita fuderunt, ut propè ad internecionem afflix∣erint. Agro inde rursus longe lateque vastato, domum est reditum. Imolenses ca∣stri Sancti Cassiani, quod ex Diaecesi sua cum Bononiensibus sentiebat, iruerunt. Erat tum in Germania Conradus ex Italia nuper post varios excitatos tumultus rever∣sus. Is licet magna pecunia rerumque omnium difficultate oppressus, tamen par∣tium studio multos adhuc causae suae studiosos habebat. Ea res fecit, ut manenti∣bus adhuc seditionibus Lotharius exercitum conficere haud magnum potuerit. Cum iis igitur quas parare potuit, copiis sequenti anno in Italiam per vallem Tridentinam, Othone & Sigeberto authoribus, transiit, atque à Bononiensibus, & Aemiliensibus cum Conradi studio, tum copiarum exiguitate contemptus, recta ad Appenninum accessit, ac Pisas ad sumendum Innocentium properavit. Caeterum Innocentius à Genuensibus comiter & honorifice jam bis acceptus, hanc eis gratiam retulit, quod Episcopum eorum, obedientia Archiepiscopi Mediolanensis exemptum Archiepiscopum fecit, at∣que ei dimidiam Episcoporum Corsicae partem subjecit. Syrus primus ea dignitate est usus. Genua inde Placentiam terrestri itinere profectus novo Anacletum, & fauto∣res ejus concilo jugulavit. Via inde Aemilia ingressus 17 Kalendar Junias Bononi∣am
venit, mox superato Apennino Pisas progressus, pacem inter Pisanos & Genuenses composuit, eorumque Ecclesiam perinde ac Genuensem Metropolitanam effecit; parte altera Episcoporum Corsicae, contributa, quae res adhuc discordiam inter eas Civita∣tes aluerat. Haec vero illo, cum ad vetera earum Civitatum erga se beneficia persol∣venda, tum ad nova duris his temporibus provocanda studiose agente, Lotharius su∣pervenit, atque ipso ut dixi assumpto Viterbiam, atque inde Romam perrexit. Ibi castris ad portam S. Agnetis locatis, Genuenses & Pisanos Classes suas littoribus admo¦vere Romanis jussit, ac, tantum Anacleto, & fautoribus ejus qui Urbem tenebant, terroris injecit, ut in editas se turres salutis suae tuendae causa referrent. Qua re animadversa ab amicis receptus, ipse cum Innocentio Urbem pacato agmine init: cum∣que illum in Laterano reposuisset, ipse Aventinum insedit. Rebus in hunc modum habentibus duo inde sibi expedienda putavit, unum, ut praesentem controversiam cum Anacleto aliqua ratione finiret; alteram, ut Coronam ab Innocentio Augusta∣lem acciperet. Ubi vero se dissidium tollere non posse sensit, quod Anacletus ad id neque Colloquii neque Praelii facere Copiam vellet, omne studium ad insignia reci∣pienda convertit. Huic rei cum illud obstaret, quod Anacletus basilicam Vaticanam operibus, praesidioque firmatam tenebat, in qua moris fuerat Diadema Imperatorium tradi, Innocentius, ne qua ei solemni mora injiceretur, Lotharium in Lateranum vocavit, atque ibi pridie Nonas Junias ipsi Coronam imposuit, ac protenus ad prodendam rei novo exemplo actae memoriam, hujus facti seriem regiae in pariete pingi, atque hos Versus subscribi mandavit: Rex venit ante fores, jurans prius Vrbis honores, Post homo fit Papae, sumit quo dante Coronam. This Emperour Lotharius departing soon after from Rome into Germany, Eo urbe profecto Anacleti factio è turribus exiit, ac per urbem volitans caedem amicis Innocen∣tii intentare, ac novo omnia tumultu permiscere instituit.Vita Bernar∣di, l. 2. c. 2. Quare Innocentius intel∣ligens manisionem suam in urbe rationibus Ecclesiae parum conducere, ne praesentia sua rabiem, ac furorem adversariorum accenderet, Pisas, Civium erga se benignita∣tem expertus repetiit, eoque novum Concilium ex toto Occidente indixit. Quod ubi Bernardus Claravallensis audivitBernardi E∣pistola 130. Epistolam, quae extat, ad Pisanos scripsit, adhor∣tans eos ut singulari studio Pontificem cum Cardinalibus custodirent, atque honoris accepti magnitudinem assiduitate Officii compensarent. Assumitur, inquit, Pisa in locumTherefore the Popes Claim to Saint Peters Chair at Rome was to∣tally annihi∣lated by divine providence, and translated to Pisa. Romae, et de cunctis urbibus terrae ad Apostolicae sedis cul∣men eligitur, nec fortuitu sive humano istud contigit Consilio, sed coelesti providentia, et Dei benigno favore fit, qui diligentes se di∣ligit, qui dixit Christo suo Innocentio Pisam inhabita, et ego benedicens benedicam ei, hic habitabo, quoniam eligi eam Me au∣ctore. Tyranni Siculi malitiae Pisana constantia non cedit, nec minis concuti∣tur, nec donis corrumpitur, nec circumvenitur dolis. O Pisani, Pisani, magnificavit Dominus facere vobiscum, facti sumus laetantes. Quae Civitas non invidet? Serva depositum urbs fidelis, agnosce gratiam, stude Praerogativae non inveniri ingrata. Honora tuum, & Universitatis patrem; honoraMundi. mundo Principes, qui in te sunt, & Judices terrae, quorum te praesentia reddit illustrem, gloriosam, famosam. Alioquin si ignoras te, O pulchra inter Civitates, ingredires post greges fidelium tuorum pa∣scere haedos tuos. At the same timeEpistola 131. St. Bernard writ an Epistle to the Clergy and Peo∣ple of Millain, (whose Archbishop Anselmus, Innocentius had degraded, and erected two Archbishopricks in lieu thereof, for siding with Anacletus;) informing them by his intercession, mediation, that Pope Innocent was ready to receive them into his favour, to confirm their new-elected Bishop Robaldus, restore their Arch∣bishoprick to them, and send them a Pall without delay, if they would consent and adhere to Innocent and Lotharius, and desert Anacletus. Benè vobiscum facit Deus, Benè vobiscum facit Romana Ecclesia. Facit ille quod Pater, facit illa quod Mater. Et revera quid vobis debuit facere & non fecit? Si postulastis mitti vobis de Curia honorabiles personas ad honorem Dei & vestrum, factum est: si postulastis confirmari quod unanimitas vestra venerabilis Patris vestri electione firmaverat, factum est. Si voluistis licuisse vobis quod illicitum, nisi pro magna quidem necessitate Sacri Canones judicant, translationem Episcopi scilicet in Archiepiscopum, concessum est. Si roga∣stis
erui Cives vestros de Vinculis Placentinorum quod utique ego praetermittere nec volo, nec valeo, Et hoc factum est. In quo postremo quocunque rationabili petitio filiae, non dico repulsam, sed vel moram passa est, apud pam matrem? En ad complementum pallium praesto est, plenitudo honoris. Nunc vero audi me inclyt∣plebs, Gens Nobilis, Civitas gloriosa. Audi inquam, me (veritatem dico; non men∣tior) dilectorem tui, zelatorem salutis tuae. Romana Ecclesia valdè clemens est, sed nihilominus potens. Fidele Consilium, & omni acceptione dignum, noli abuti clemen∣tia, ne potentia opprimaris. Sed dicit aliquis debitam ei reverentiam exhibebo, & ni∣hil amplius. Esto, fac quod dicis; quod si exhibeas debitam, & omnimodam; Plenitu∣do siquidem potestatis super universas Orbis Ecclesias, singulari Prerogativa Apostolicae Sedi donata est. Qui igitur huic potestati resistit, Dei ordinationi resistit.And cannot the Emperor and every King do as much without the Pope? but the Pope could not justly do this without their assent. Potest eos qui sunt altos deprimere, alios sub∣limare prout ratio sibi dictaverit, ita ut de Episcopis creare Archiepiscopos liceat, & è converso si necesse visum fuerit. Potest à finibus terrae sublimes quascunque perso∣nas Ecclesiasticas evocare, & cogere ad suam praesentiam non semel aut bis, sed quotiens expedire videbit. Porro in promptu est ei omnem ulcisci inobedientiam si quis fortè reluctari conatus fuerit. Denique, probasti & tu, quid enim contulit tibi, vetus tua rebellio, & recalcitratio malè suasa à pseudo-Propheris tuis? Quem fruc∣tum habuisti, in quibus nunc erubescis? Agnosce potius in qua potestate, Gloria & Honore suffraganeorum tuorum tam diu privata extitisti. Quis pro te valuit obviare Apostolicae authoritatis justissimae severitati, cum provocata tuis excessibus; decrevit te tuis illis antiquis ac praeclaris ornamentis nudare, mutilare membris; & hodie confusa & truncata jaceres, si non benignius quàm potentius tecum actum fu∣isset. Quis eam prohibere valebit etiam à gravioribus, si rursum (quod absit) adjece∣ris provocare? Vide ne patiaris recidivum quia pro certo (nisi fallor) non tam fa∣cilè denuò poterit inveniri remedium. Si quis itaque dixerit tibi, partim oportet obedire cum in te experta sis plentitudinem Apostolicae potestatis, authoritatis integri∣tatem; nonne hujusmodi aut seductus, aut seducere vult? Sed fac quod dico, nam ego te non seduco, &c. Not long after this Epistle St. Bernard and Pope Innocents Legate repairing to Mil∣lain, they submitted themselves to Pope Innocent and renounced Anacletus. After which by Pope Innocents command, S. Bernard was sent to Papia and Cremona to reconcile them by a Parly; but those of Cremona would by no means receive him. Lotharius having pacified Germany, at the Popes Importunity, Anno 1136. entred into Italy with two great Armies to restore Pope Innocent,Anno 1136. expell Anacletus out of Rome, and reduce all parts of Italy adhering to him. Having reduced Millain, Cremona and other Cities to his obedience; Henry Duke of Bavaria the Emperors General with part of his Army conducted Innocent to Rome:Anno 1537. Ibi tertio nonas Maii Conventus omnium Episcoporum Abbatumque qui adesse potuerunt est habitus, ac rursus Anacletus Rogeriusque devotus: Eo post triduum Henricus urbe cum Innocentio egressus,Sigonius, l. 2. Albam, quae cum Anacleto sentiebat, invasit, ac suburbiis disiectis infestum indè in Campaniam ducere exercitum instituit. Ac statim Richardum Monachum qui idem Innocentii erat Sacerdos ad Cassinas Monasterium misit, qui mo∣neret Rinaldum (whom they had elected Abbot, adhering to the contrary party) se si Innocentio obtemperare, & Lotharium recipere in animum induxisset, Monaste∣rium ab omni maleficio, atque injuria servaturum. Qua re audita, Rinaldus Mona∣chos advocavit, atque ut in fide Anacleti, Rogeriique persisterent obsecravit, se enim Monasterium quod ab eis acceperit, in eorum retinere potestate constituisse, subito∣que auxilia nova ac civit, quibus se Monasterium tueri posse confidit. Quae ubi Ri∣chardus vidit, ex loco decessit ac Civitatem quae Monasterio continens est, Sacramen∣tum dicere Innocentio jussit. Diebus inde undecim interiectis Henricus Rinaldum ad se vocavit, acceptoque aureo calice, & quadraginta libris, contraque obsidibus aliquot datis, Abbatiam illi nomine Imperatoris firmavit, si in ejus fide mansisset, & vexillum Imperatoris in arce quae aedi S. Benedicti, imminet, statuit. After many Sieges and Battles all or most of the Cities in Capua, Campania, and Apulia being ta∣ken by Lotharius his forces, and reduced to Pope Innocent, (recorded at large by Sigonius) he thus proceeds in the Story of Rinaldus and his Monks, and Pope Inno∣cents deportment towards them, and Lotharius.Sigonius, . 11. p. 267, &c. See Chronicon Casinense. l. 4, c. 104, 105, &c. Centur.

Senioreto inde mortuo eadem renunciari, Rinaldo jussit, adjiciens, ut quoniam infesto Sancti Petri Con∣ventum Melfiam edixisset, ipse quoque Monachis secum prudentissimis ductis eo veni∣ret, omniaque Monasterii privilegia secum ferret. Quibus Literis Rinaldus sibi ob∣temperandum ratus, Melfiam ad lacum pensilem, ubi universus Lotharii exercitus cum Innocentio Pontifice confidebat, accessit. Adventanti ei Innocentius nunciis obvian missis mandavit, ut prius, quam castra iniret, ipse cum Monachis suis sibi nudis pedibus satisfaceret, ac pro obedientia Anacleto exhibita, piaculum quod imponeretur, acciperet, ac jurejurando omnia sua se mandata facturum, et Anacletum repudiaturum, sanciret: Rinaldus subica re perturbatusAn Appeal from the Pope to the Emperor himself. Lotharium ap∣pellavit, & se ex ejus sententia deliberaturum respondit, atque ita castra ingressus Lotharii jussu tabernaculum suum propè illius tabernaculum posuit. Ea res animum haud mediocriter Innocentii perculit. Itaque missis Cardinalibus, à Lothario postu∣lavit, ut Rinaldum cum Monachis Anacleti obedientiae renunciare, et sibi dicere sacramentum juberet, Monachis autem sibi per Majorum suorum instituta, jurare fas esse negantibus, jussit, ut ab eorum qui absentes essent, consuetudine abstineret. Qua re motus Lotharius diem 7 Idus Julias ad causam cognoscendam, constituit, atque utriusque partis patronos in consilio, ad illam diem adesse praecepit. Ea ubi dies venit ipse cum peregrino Patriarcha Aquileiense, Archiepi∣scopis, Episcopis, & Abbatibus plurimis assidens ad Consilium, retulit, num Mo∣nachi Cassinates, quod Anacletum recipissent, inpaenam Anathematis incurris∣sent? et num salvis legibus cogi ad jurandum Innocentio obsequium possent? Res per multos dies magna altercatione peracta est. I shall at large relate the History of this contest, and Councils proceedings, more clearly discovering the Arrogance,Chronicon Casinense, l. 4. c. 105, to 116. Centur. Magd. 12. c. 8. col. 1150, to 1166. Obstinacy, Ingratitude, & uncharitableness of this proud Pope to the Emperor, who with so much pains and expence had twice restored him to his See, from whence he twice fled and was ejected by Anacletus; and likewise the Emperors Jurisdiction to be paramount the Popes, in calling, presiding, ruling judging in Councils, even in Appeals, cases between the Pope, Church of Rome, and other Ecclesiastical persons and Churches. In nomine Domini Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi, Anno ab incarnatione ejus 1138. in∣dictione prima, septimo Idus Julii, Anno Imperii Domini Lotharii Caesaris septimo, resi∣dente eodem invictissimo Principe ad aquas Pensiles, consedente etiam Peregrino Patri∣archa Aquilegiensi, cum Archiepiscopis, Abbatibus quampluribus, Causidicus pro Ro∣mana Ecclesia directus est Gerardus Cardinalis, titulo Sanctae Crucis, & Guido Ca∣dinalis, qui ambo posteà Romani fuêre Pontifices: Aimericus Cancellarius, & Diaco∣nus Cardinalis Presbyter, Baldwinus Cardinalis, qui post Pisanus Archiepiscopus fuit, &Misprinted Robertus. Bernardus Clarevallensis Abbas, & alii plurimi Romanae Ʋrbis Nobiles. Ex par∣te Casinensis Ecclesiae auditores fuere Henricus Dux, Imperatoris gener; Conradus Dux, qui post imperii Sceptra tenuit, Otto Imperatoris consobrinus, Fridericus Marchio Anconitanus, Mala Spina Marchio Liguriae, Henricus Episcopus Ratisponensis, Han∣no Episcopus Basiliensis, Hanno Abbas Luneburgensis, Galfridus Palatinus, Romani Imperii Judex. Facto itaque silentio Imperator dixit: Non modo praesentium, et temporalium, verum futurarum aeternarum rerum in hoc conventu discussio erit. Constat enim, Sanctos Patres, dum unius rei gratia Concilia saepe celebrarent, plurima unius oc∣casione definiisse. Ita et hc Romanae quidem et Cassinensis Ecclesiae causa cum specialiter agi videatur, variae tamen agente Deo, solventur quaestiones, fiet que unius Ecclesiae causa salus omnium per orbem constitutarum. Nos quoque vestigia Praede∣cessorum nostrorum sequentes, dignum duximus huic interesse Concilio, et eorum quae dicentur librare monumenta. Defensores utriusque disceptantium partis magnificos a nostro latere dedi∣mus viros, qui violentiam omnem prohibeant. Igitur in Domini no∣mine sedeant, quibus Romanae non displicent leges, taciteque rerum exitum expectent, ne dum omnes confusè vel dicunt, vel obstrepunt, veritas obnubiletur. Hac & alia plura
dum praefatus esset Augustus, Conradus ab Imperatore defensor datus, inquit, Copia Imperiasium verborum me fecit fandi inopem, cum tàm profundè, tàm plenè, tanta∣que ratione Imperialis sit praefata Majestas, ut non humano opere, sed Divino pro∣dusse videantur. Ducibus tamen atque Comitibus, mecam defensoribus datis, visum est primo apparatu hodiernae Sessionis proferri, quae sint  parte dis∣ceptaturae personae, vel si cui permittitur disceptandi licentia, nisi  tantum quibus fuerit concessa. Omnis enim, maximèque divina conventus , ordinatè fieri ac rationabiliter debet; quippe cum nil prfectè definiri possit, ubi confunditure ordo loquendi, Placuit omnibus sententia Ducis, & quis pro utraque parte  inquiri∣tur, quinam item inter pretes, & quis esset disputantibus locus. Elig  Gerardus Car∣dinalis Sanctae Crucis, qui pro Romana, & Petrus Diaconus, qui pro Casinensi respon∣deret Ecclesia. Interpretes dati sunt Bertulfus Imperatoris Cancellarius, Anfredus Vestiarius, & Bertulphus Masionarius. Traditur autem Gerardo locus ante Impera∣toris faciem. Ad pides vero ejus constituitur Petrus Diaconus. Renuit Girardus Mo∣nachum ad suos sedere pedes, dicent, nequaquam oportere sive licere excommunicatum cum filio sedere Ecclesis. At Imperator finem litigio imponens, Petrum Diaconum extunc & doinceps sedere ad pedes suos jussit. Tum taliter Gerardus Cardinalis loqui orsus est. Sancta & universalis Eccles, invictissime Imperator, quae & vos & praedecessores vestros orbis totius dominatores effecit, mirari non desinit, cur ex∣communicatores, & à laminibus Ecclesiae separatos receperitis. Ad haec Imperator, Imperii quidem nostri nos ab Apostolica sede gaudemus accepisse coronam, excom∣municatos nullo pacto suscepisse putainus; hoc tamen ex conflictu vestro constabit. Pan∣dulphus Theanensis Episcopus Casinensis Monachus dixit, Quomodo Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalis Cannenses Monachis excommunicatos asserat, videre non possumu. Girardus Cardinalis dixit; Quid mihi & tibi bone Tit? Alienus nobis es. O mirum, O novum in∣auditumque prodigium, ut truncus ramis praecisis, & à radicibus evulsus novas contra Ec∣clesiam erigat Machinas. Ad haecThe Empe∣ror rules and moderates in this Council. Imperator; Cesset, inquit, omnis violentia: hic enim non inferendae vel referendae injuriae, sed feren∣dae potius aequanimiter sunt. Quocirca statuimus, ut neutra pars utatur in alteram contumeliis, ne quod ad laudem Domini, et po∣sterorum utilitatem statuatur, in litigium riramque vertatur. Tunc Girardus resumpto sermone, sic ait, Decrevit Sancta & Universalis Ecclesia, ut Casinesis Coenabii Monachi voluntatem Domini nostri Innocentii pii & universaliae Papae, se in omnibus impleturos Sacramento confirment. Jam enim Inno∣centis ipse hos Casinenses Monachos dispergere per diversa loca statu rat, nisi Lotha∣rius Clementissis Imperator, nolens Casinensem Ecclesiam destrui pro ipsa Ecclesia contra Papae voluntatem se objecusset. Cumitaque Girardus Cardinalis de Sacramento Monachorum sermonem fecisset, Petrus Diaconus respondit, Non parum miramur, cur Dominus Cardinalis Monachos Sacramento velit astringi, cum Dominus in Evengelio,See here, Book 4. ch. . p. 706, 707, 708. Jusjurandum omnino  Girardus Candinalis dixit, Quod Monachus ait, probmus; sed Romana Ecclesia Casinenses Monachos sine Sacramen∣to recipien los non esse dicernit. Patrus Diaconus ait, In regula Sanctissimi Patris no∣stri Benedicti jurare omnino interdicitur Monachis. Quod non modo di∣vinae, verum humanae quoque prohibent leges. Quippe inter Im∣peratorum praecepta Caroli, Ludovici, Hugonis, Lotharii, Berengarii, Alber∣ti, trium Othonum, quinque Heinricorum et Conradi, sic invenitur: sta∣tuimus, ut Monachi ad Sacramentum non compellantur. Et haec dicens, pracepta ipsorum Imperatorum, Casinensi collata Monasterio, auro, plum∣bo, ceraque signata, Imperatori caeterisque monstravit. Ea Imperator praecepta excipiens deosculatus est, moxque in haec verba prorupit: Magno∣rum Sanctorumque Principum haec esse praecepta, ex sigillis agno∣vimus: Convenit Majestati nostrae, cuncta praedecessorum nostro∣rum servare praecepta. Quare Dominum Apostolicum vos qui hic illius adestis vice, ex nobisRegum Pre∣ces sun Impe∣riae. orate, ut sanctissimorum Imperatorum praecepta nobiscum protegere, suaque authoritate confirmare digne∣tur: Quis enim jam Imperatorem observaret si ab Apostolico con∣temnatur? Omnia membra sequuntur caput, neque ab eo nisi magno suo detrimento se∣parari
queunt. Certes itaque pro membris caput, pronatis Pater, pro ovibus Pastor: quia nullo modo Lupirabies praevalet, ubi cura sollicita pastoris invigilat. Sit igitur hodi∣erno consensui finis, et hospitia sua singuli repetant. Cardinales vota nostra Pontifici referant, Casinenseque Caenobium ut mecum foveat nostra vice precentur, Mo∣nachi Electo suo quae dicta sunt referant, et crastina die quid respon∣dere objectis debeant, parent. Tertia diei hora hic adesse singuli cu∣rent, hodiernusque tractatus, adhibitis notariis, literis mandetur, ne oblivion tradantur, quae posteris quoque profutura praevidimus. His dictis in sua quique disecssere. Imperator ad ea quae sibi imminebant, negotia tractanda resedit. Postera die utraeque conveniunt disceptantium partes. At ubi ingressis data copia est fandi, Girardus Cardinalis dixit, Mandato pietatis vestrae, Sanctissime Imperator,Note his Papal Pride, Obstina∣cy, malice. retulimus summae Sedis Antistiti: Sed haec nullo modo implere se posse respondit, asserens, facilius se Pontificalia vestimenta deponere, ac pedibus subjecta calcare, quam quae abs te rogantur efficere. Ad haec Imperator paulisper obticuit, De tunc reliquas disputationes hesternas concludere jussit. Girardus dixit, Memini nos die hesterno de Sacramento Casinensium Monachorum tractavisse, nihilque inde fuisse definitum: De eadem igitur denuò tractaturi, denuò proponere debemus ex parte Domini nostri, quae heri quoque proposuimus, fidem, scilicet Apostolico à Casinen∣sibus Sacramento promittendam, perpetuamque obedientiam, alioquin nunquam illos pa∣tietur Domini corporis ac sanguinis participes fieri. Ad haec Petrus, Constat inquit Do∣minum Cardinalem hesterni tractatus renovasse conflictum, nostrosque terminos ad redivi∣va reparasse certamina. Nobis contra satis superque videtur huic sententiae Dominicis obivisse praeceptis, quibusSee here Book 4. c. 2. p. 706, 707. omnino jurare prohibemur: fidem autem à nobis Sacramento exigi profecto otiosum est, cum hanc sponte simus exhibere consueti. Girardus inquit, Non est veritus Monachus coram invictissimo Principe mendosa proferre, dicens Casi∣nenses Monachos Romanae Ecclesiae semper servasse fidem, cum constat omnibus, eos ha∣ctenus schismaticos esse, Abbatemque à schismatico ordinatum praefecisse. Petrus Pru∣dentius inquit, Viri est, non antè quempiam falsitatis arguere quàm ipsum omnibus mendacium in conspectum dederit, & cum nihil contra possit opponi à conscientia sua, qui mentitus est, ipse accusetur. Inique igitur & obliquè me petit Dominus Cardinalis, qui tacito mendacio me falsitatis insimulat, proponaetur causa, aperiantur mendacia: tunc me fallacem asserat, tunc mendacii arguat. Girardus, facilè id quidem probare est. Nam cum relicto Innocentio, schismatico adestis, quid nisi infideles fuistis? Petrus, Deum ero, inquit, illum nos, an potius nos ille demisit? Girardus, Ecclesia, inquit, à schis∣maticis capta, piissimus de sua sede est pulsus Episcopus: sicque Italia relicta, properavit ad Gallias. Petrus; Nonne Pastor bonus Christus Jesus cum diversitatem, imò unita∣tem in se unitam ostenderet:Joan. 10. Bonus pastor, inquit, animam suam dat pro ovibus suis? Girardus, Haec, inquit, non solum verbis, verum & factis ostendit. Petrus, Rursus ip∣se Dominus, cum descripsisset optimi facta Pastoris, Mercenarii quoque mores adjunxit, dicens, Mercenarius, & qui non est Pastor, cujus non sunt oves propriae, videt lu∣pum venientem, & dimittit oves, et fugit. Agnoscis profectò Evangelii verba. Gi∣rardus: Ita sanè. Petrus, Hocne Romanum agere Pontificem decet? Girar∣dus; Tantò, inquit, magis ab Apostolicae sedis sunt observanda Pontifice, quanto pecu∣liarius suscepit aliis praedicanda. Petrus, Quid igitur? Ovibus ne imputabitur, si quid pastor amisit? Girardus, minimè, inquit. Petrus, Ergo Monachis imputandum non est, si Pastore destituti, morsibus lupi patuerunt. Debuit enim Apostolicus (ut ait Dominus) oves suas non modo non dimittere, verum pro eis quoque mortem libenter amplecti. Ad haec Imperator, Patet, in∣quit ex assertione, Monachi si quid peccaverunt, Pastoris culpa contigisse, non ovium. Ʋnde rogana adhuc est Domini Apostolici pietas, ut nobiscum, quae contra nos gessêre, dimittat. Quare hodiernae quaestioni finem pla∣cet imponi. Occupati enim Reipublicae curis, diutius his interesse non possumus; quis∣que igitur revertatur ad propria. Cras idem certamen rursum ineundum est. Hoc dicto cum omnium favore discessum est. Altera die, cum piissimus Imperator, memoratique Proceres, au∣dituri quae residua erant, consedissent, hac voce incipit; Cum exer∣citui,
tum omnibus qui intra Romanum orbem sunt, notissimum credimus, quanta in reverentia & observatione Casinensem Ecclesiam, ut suam scilicet peculiarem Ca∣meram, majores nostri habuerunt; & super omnia Monasteria Imperii Romani dilexe∣runt, honoribusque & privilegiis eximis exaltarunt. Deceret itaque dominum quoque Apostolicum mecum eandem fovere Ecclesiam quod auxi∣liante Domino in posterum fiet. Non est autem ista quae agitatur controversia, di∣cenda lis,1 Cor. 12. cum constet, membra secum litigare non posse, neque Caput dicere manui, Ne∣cessarium te non habeo; neque oculus pedi; viliora saepè nostra utiliora sunt. Nullus igitur, nos indecens aliquid existimet facere, quod Casinense Monasterium quasi tueri vi∣demur. Nam neque cum vel mater filiam, vel conjugem vir, aut filium pater ira stimu∣lante caeciderit, si quis se inter saevientem patrem & paventem filium obiciat medium, na∣tum{que} ab immoderata caede patris eripiat, cum mansueverit, pater homini illi indignabi∣tur, sed contra maximas habbit gratias, quod filium è fuis subtraxerit manibus: ita et universalis mater Ecclesia cum posita ira requieverit, gratias aget Imperio nostro, quod ipsius irae subdurimus. Agantur ergo quae agenda restant: quia nunquam desistam, quin compleam desi∣derium meum. His dictis, Girardus Cardinalis dixit, Vestrae magnitudinis verba, sacratissime Imperator, & semper Auguste, precesque Domino Innocentio Papae retuli∣mus, sed nullo pacto, sine sacramento Casinenses ut recipiat, induci potest. Petrus Diaconus dixit, Satis nos fecisse his, & ex praecepto Domini, & ex Im∣perialibus edictis existimamus. Alia si quae habes, edicito. Girardus, Ignoras, Invic∣tissime Imperator, hos quos vestra magnitudo defendit, cu Rogerio Siculorum Comite, contra Romanam Ecclesiam vestrumque conjurasse Imperium, nequè non solum conjurasse, verùn anathematizasse & damnasse? O Rem inauditam, ut ligati & ligent solutos, & solvant ligatos! Ad haec Caesar indicto silentio dixit, Quod in me Casinenses admi∣sere libens tolero, gratèque remitto. Exemplo itaque nostro, quod in Ro∣manum Pontificem commiserunt, et ipse dimittat. Girardus, Et si Domini nostri Innocentii pii universalis Papae agimus vices, hujusmodi tamen sine illo definire non possumus. His dictis favente Imperatore discessum est. Nocte insecu∣ta cum Imperator duraret pervigil, Petrus Diaconus genu flexo ante illum ita pro Casinensi orabat Ecclesia, Cum omnes mortales vobis militent, ut Domino re∣rum atque principi, Vos autem ipsi Imperatori Coelesti pacis, pietatis atque justitiae au∣tori, humiliamini: Aliter enim utriusque vitae salus tuta esse non poterit, nisi talibus mi∣nistratoribus gubernetur. Itaque, Imperator invicte, cum Majestatem vestram cunctas per orbem tueri Ecclesias deceat, Casinensi ta∣men Ecclesiae ideo magis te exhibere convenit, quia magis opus habet, cum nobis et loqui licitum non sit, et indulta ab Imperato∣ribus privilegia pro nihilo habeantur. Nam Romano Pontifici obtemperandum et ipse censeo: sed Deum illi quoque praeferendum, libera voce profiteor, neque enim illi irrogatur injuria si sibi prae∣feratur Deus. Totus in Casinensis Ecclesiae dejectione Monasticus ordo vacillat. Te ergo Imperatore, Monachis sua jura tollentur? Te Imperatore à Monachis Sacra∣mentum extorquebitur? Te tuamque clementiam deprecamur, Imperator Invicte, ne hoc de∣cernas, ne statuas, ne hujusce decreto subscribas. Indignum profectò est, ut te agente abrogetur Casinensis Ecclesiae dignitas, ut Cardinalibus proveniat malae voluntatis af∣fectus. Nihil majus est religione, nihil sanctius ordine Monastico, nihilique sublimius Patre Benedicto. Quid respondebit Carolomannus pius Imperator Au∣gustus? Nonne tibi dicet, Imperium me dimisisse non credidi, quia Lotharium ju∣stum & sanctum Imperatorem habebam, Imperium me deposuisse non dolui, quia Impe∣ria mea praesertim de religione Monastica inconvulsa perpetuò manere credebam. Titu∣los ego pietatis, justitiae atque mansuetudinis in Casino exexeram, has de mundi pressuris manubias referebam. Quid mihi plus potuit meus hostis auferre? modò inquam, modò abrogantur decreta mea. Nunc gravius telum excipio corpore cum a Romano Pontifice mea decreta damnantur. Nunc mihi abroga∣tur Imperium, et quod est gravius, a Pontificibus Romanis, et hoc praesente fratre meo Imperatore Lothario. Cui enim magis quam sibi praestat Imperator, si instituta majorum, si Casinensis Coenobii
conservat? Nulli ergo grave vidiatur, si defendimus religionis Monasticae sia∣tum. Certe à beato Benedicto ad Innocentium Papam, 113 Romani Pontifices nume rantur, ii omnes Casinense Coenobium dilexerunt, coluerunt, auxerunt, nullus Religio∣nem violavit. Jam verò si quid meretur veneranda canities, beatum Benedictum in∣troducamus loquentem; Optime Imperator, Pater Patriae, Caesar Auguste, reverere ca∣nos meos, in quos aetas me longa provexit. Utantur licite filii mei legibus suis, à me sibi salubriter traditis. Decet enim ut vivant meo more. Per hos occiduum Orbem in mea redegi jura, per hos Anglia, multaeque Nationes ad Christum conversae sunt. Mea est horum salus, tutela, juvamen. Cum haec & his similia Petrus orasset, ad Bertulfi Cancellarii tentorium, Imperatore jubente, regressus est. Cum igitur evo∣cati Cardinales ad Imperatorem egressi essent, Girardus ait, Quae heri vestra sublimitas jussit Domino nostro retulimus: benigne vestra postu∣lata suscepit. Causam tamen permolestam sibi a vobis injungi conquestus est. Ius enim Episcopale, quod sui habuerunt majores, nullo se pacto, nulla ratione posse dimittere. Lotharius ad haec: Nos, inquit, Casmensem Ecclesiam eo magis honorare decet, quo majoribus nostris in honore ac reverentia habitam scimus atque ditatam. Nam sciat Dominus Apostoli∣cus, castra, praedia, villas, omnem{que} Monasterii possessionem juris nostri esse. Episcopale autem jus suum in nullo violamus. Ber∣tulfus Cancellarius dixit: Nil juris sui Apostolicus in Casinense debet habere Coenobium, quod Romani Imperii specialis Camera esse decernitur, nisi Abbatis consecrationem, quam Heinrico Impera∣tore concedente, habuisse, dignoscitur. Girardus, Placeat ergo consilium meum vestro Imperio, Caesar invicte, ut vobis quibus Secularium, Aposto∣lico vero spiritualium rerum fidem sacramento confirment. Lotha∣rius; Nostro valde inhonestum videtur Imperio, Majorum nostro∣rum non servare mandata, eorumque Sanctissimis non obedire praeceptis. Nam si nos illa negligimus atque noumus, quis ea servabit? Quo pacto alios haec servare compellimus, si nos ea con∣vellimus? Lex itaque Imperatorum non plus aliis, quam Impe∣ratoribus ipsis constituitur. Imo illos hanc magis servare conve∣nit, ne a seipsis descivisse videantur. Girardus Cardinalis dixit, Non pa∣rum quoque Dominus Papa miratur, cum te Ecclesia in Caesa∣rem orbis dominatorem consecraverit, cur contra eum niti pro Casinen∣si Ecclesia videaris, quam non ad te ut asseris, sed ad se, ut caeteras Ecclesias, pertinere testatur. Tum Imperator iratus: Immo (inquit) nos valde miramur, cur nostris precibus annuere nolit, cum nos ipsius gratia annum jam dimidium in Papilionibus com∣morati cum Romano exercitu, pecunias in usus publicos deputa∣tas, in ipsius obsequium converterimus, omnesque ultramonta∣nos populos illi obtemperare fecerimus. Quid ergo mirum, si Casinensem tuemur Ecclesiam, cum constet, id a majoribus nostris gloriose actum? & illi quidem eam tanti fecerunt, ut ibi magis quam domi sepeliri delegerint. Quid de Sanctissimo & omni honore nominando Augusto Carolo dicam, qui relicto Imperii sceptris, Monasticam ibi transegit vitam? Quid de ipsius Caroli fratre Pipino loquar, qui defunctum apud se Monachum fratrem Casinum, ibi tumulan∣dum, cum honore remisit? Raches quoque Longobardorum Rex, relicto regno, ad ip∣sum venerabile Monasterium venit, monasticamque ibi exercuit vitam. Quid de Impe∣ratoribus Justiniano, Justino, Theodorico, Pipino, Carolo, Pipino, Carolo, Magno, binis Ludovicis, Hugone, duobus Lothariis, Alberto, tribus Othonibus, quinque Heinricis? Quid de Constantinopolitano & Alexio referam? Qui omnes Ca∣sinensem Ecclesiam et summo affectu dilexerunt, et magnis illustra∣bere muneribus. Adeò Casinensis Ecclesia Imperatoribus extitit grata, ut ad e∣jus liberationem Romani Imperatores cum omni exercitu venerint. Heinricus enim ius, invictissimus, Christanissimusque Imperator ad eam tuendam cum Centum Octo∣ginta
millibus Militum Italiam ingressus est, eaqu à Capuam Principis ditione sublatam pristinae restituit dignitati. Conradus autem Imperator Augultus, & Heinricus ipsi iis filius cum Centum Sexaginta Millibus pugnatorum ea, defensurus Ecclesiam ve∣nit, cum Pandulphi nequissimi, non aicam Principis sed Tyranni jugo premeretur. O∣mittimus nova & nostra gesta memoria. Antiquiora repetamus locique situ, cujus pro∣priè fuerit videaus. Varro nempe (ut legimus) Romanorum nobilissimus ac doctis∣simus hanc sibi sedem eligisse, extruxisse, multisque illustrem monumentis reddidisse, cognoscitur. Ipsum Casinatem fundum (ut M. Tullius in Philippicis refert) Caesar An∣tonio tradidit. At fortassis objicitur, Benedictum Patrem Romanae Ecclesiae alum∣num, illud instruxisse Coenobium. Quis id nesciat? Sed Romanorum nobilium sustul∣tus auxilio id eum fecisse cognoscimus. Beatissimo namque Papa Gregorio referente d∣dicimus, Beatum Benedictum una cum Mauro Senatoris equitii Placido ue Tertulli pa∣tricii filio, ad Monasterium Casinense construendum divinitus fuisse directum. Alibi quoque expressimus, Casinum cum finibus suis à Tertullo paricio jure suo haereditarso praecisum, Patrique Benedicto traditum legimus. Quid plura? aut Romana Ec∣clesia Romani Imperii Cameram Casinense Coenobium decenter ac∣cipiat, aut ab ea Romanum Imperium irrevocabiliter separabitur. Girardus Cardinalis ait, Nequaquam, invictissime Caesar, vestra indignetur mansue∣tudo, nec super Domini Apostolici indignetur mandatis, neque Domini Innocentii pii & universalis Papae mandata videantur injusta. Verùm siquid in his displicet, ad eum refe∣ratur. His dictis, quarti diei est solutus conventus. Manè facto, cum utraeque partes ante Imperatoris praesentiam constitissent, Girardus qui vicem Romanae gerebat Ecclesiae, dixit. Noverit vestra Celsitudo, Caesar invicte, haec Dominum Apostolicum vestris ita annuisse mandatis, ut vestri causa, fidelitate o∣missa, Sacramentum solummodo obedientiam{que} requirat. Interim quoque de electione Abbatis nobis injunxit disputandum; qua ratione Excommunicatum, et quod gravius est, Schismaticum (Rinardum) Ecclesiae Christi praetule∣runt? In which debate Petrus Diaconus proved the right of electing the Abbot to belong only to the Monkes by several instances, without the Popes concurrence; justified their election of Rinaldus to be lawfull, answering all Girardus his obje∣ctions to the contrary, who insisted principally on the Excommunication and schism of Rinaldus. Ad haec Imperator respondit, Et quae injusè hactenus gêre Casinenses Monachi, eis per omnia impetranda censuimus: haec petitionis mea summa, quam à Do∣mino Apostolico rego, ut eis quae usque in praesens incautius admiserunt, remittantur▪ Sit ergo finis hodierni conflictus. Nostra iterum rogata ad Papam referantur & pos diem quintam quid jubeat audiemus. Has autem indicias idcirco damus; ut definire melius ac stature possit. His dictis quique ad sua rediêre. Petrus vero Diaconus in Curia remansit Imperatoris. Cardinales itaque ad Apostoli∣cum redenutes, quae dicta fuerunt ei retulère, dicentes; quendam Romanum esse Ca∣sinensis Ecclesiae, qui solus pro suo Monasterio contra Romanam disceptaret Ec∣clesiam. Hunc si quo constrinxeris vinculo, alios omnes pro nihilo reputabis. His In∣nocentius auditis, interrogat, quod illi genus patriaque sit? Et illi, Pater (inquit) ejus Gregorii filius fuit, Romanorum Ducis & Consulis. Tunc Papa, auxiliante Deo, et illum, et alios tali praepedivit compede ut contra ipsum mutire non auderent: vehementi{que} ira concitatus, cum post quartam diem refer∣ri Imperatori verba praecepit, Dominium Casinensis Ecclesiae non ad illum, sed ad se pertinere, sicuti et Ecclesiarum reliquarum. Decre∣veramus, inquit, vestra interventione infidelitatem dimittere Monachis, verum quia ni∣tuntur contra nos, et haec, et alia ab eis inquirenda consulimus. Mandat deinde Pontifex per Benedictum Capellanum suum Petro Diacono, ut ab Im∣peratoris famulatu recedens, à Casinensium quoque fratrum societate se separaret: indignum esse ut Romano genere exortus, exteros praeferat contribulibus, Romanam Ec∣clesiam linquens: Proinde si Casinensibus dimissis, illos impugnare omnibus modis mal∣let, se illum inter Capellanos suos habiturum. Ad quem ille talem remisit responsum, Gratiam agens, quod se tanti aestimasset, ut obsequio suo dignum judicaret. Caete∣rum non posse se Socios in tali articulo constitutos deserere. Post peractum negoti∣um, se in servitio Sedis Apostolicae & Romani in fide Pontificis, quod vixerit, si ille vellet, permansurum. Post haec decernit Papa per omnia loca Casinensi Ecclesiae subdi∣ta literas mittere, ut Casinensi Abbati & Monachis non obedirent, omniaque Coeno∣bia
quae sub praepositis erant, sibi Abbates eligerent. Sed omnipotens Deus consilium Pontificis, voluntatem{que} impedivit. After this a Cistercian Monk scoffing at the Monks for adhering to Anacletus, and asserting their election of Raincrus to be voyd, for∣ged and reprobate: Ad haec Lotharius, De omnibus (inquit) quae contra nostram Cameram Casinensem Ecclesiam Cistellensis objecerat, Petrus Diaconus lucidè satis apertéque respondit. Sed hujus altercationis iste sit finis. Singuli ad hospitium re∣deant, manè rursum ad conflictùm redituri. Die altera, ubi lux est reddita terris, Imperator accersitis Magnatibus suis in Con∣sistorio resedit, & utrasque disceptantium partes coram se ingredi jussit: Et dum venisset Cistellensis, hujusmodi disputationis initium dedit, &c. Die altera Girardus Cardinalis ex parte Sedis Apostolicae veniens, Imperatore pro tribunali residente, ait; Romana Ecclesia, sacratissime Imperator, & semper Auguste, non ab hominibus, neque per hominem, sed per Iesum Christum fundata est, qui Petrum Apostolorum Principem illuc direxit, cui etiam claves regni coelorum tradidit: & id∣circo nullum illius gratia violari debere Apostolicus censet. Petro autem respondente, Nunquam Romanum Pontificem à Casinensibus Monachis Sacramentum exegisse. Girardus ait, Ideirco eos non haec quaesisse, quia usque ad illa tempora in Ecclesiae unitate mansissent; sed postquam schisma incurrissent, absque Sacramento reci∣piendos non esse: protulitque jussu Papae Innocentii, Capitulum Niceni Concilii, ut revertentes a schismate absque Sacramento non reciperentur. Lotharius Imperator dixit, Non vos idcirco congregavi, ut Canonum jura servetis, sed ut benigne, ut leniter cum Ecclesia Casinensi ageretis; Meminisse debe∣tis, quae in Romana Ecclesia beneficia ipse contulerim, quot et quanta pericula pro vobis cum exercitu perpessus sim, qualiter annum integrum, ac menses duos in tentoriis egerim, quot pro∣pinquos et amicissimos inter bellorum amiserim fremitus. Non enim Casinenses fratres, ad inimicum Pontificis, sed ad Romanum Imperatorem Ecclesiae propugnatorem confugere. Postremo, si me ea spe frustratum esse vultis, contestor hodie, schisma inter me et Pontificem futurum, et pro amico obsequentissimo infestissi∣mum fore inimicum. Cumque ad hanc Imperatoris vocem exer∣citus omnis acclamasset, rectaque prosecutum, fremens diceret: Primo, per omnes Episcopos; Secundo, per Archiepiscopos; Tertio, per Aquile∣giensem Patriarcham; Quarrò, per Abbates; Quintò, per Comites; Sextò, per Marchiones & Principes; Septimo, per Richizam Augustam; Octavo, per seipsum Imperator Pontificem hac de causa rogavit. Mandat dehinc Pontifex Impe∣ratori, de Casinensi Ecclesia consilium ejus voluntatemque se factu∣rum. Caesar hoc nuncio laetior factus, rursum per seipsum Pontificem adiit. Supplican∣ti itidem pro Casinensi Monasterio: Miror, ait Pontifex, cur tanta pro illis oras in∣stantia, qui te ac me anathematizarunt; qui Petri Leonis filium pro Papa receperunt; qui Coronae alteri obtemperarunt, hactenusque in priori nequitia durarunt. Tunc Impe∣rator Clementissimus totus solutus in lachrymas, dixit; Scio equidem illos haec omnia ideo egisse, ut integer ad nos Ecclesiae ipsius status perveniret. Nam si secus egissent, Ecclesia illa ab hostibus nostris eversa jaceret. Unde oro, ut censuram, qua plectendi illi erant, in me retorqueatis. Si caedendi sunt, ego pro eis dorsum submitto; si deponendi, deponi pro eis volo. Tunc Papa, Canonicae severitatis rigorem vestri causa temperamus. Jure enim deponendi erant, qui participarunt excommunicatis, qui Pontificem suum A∣nathematizarunt. Sed nos lenitate usi atque clementia, vestri amoris gratia (not for Christs sake, or command) cuncta dimittimus. Ita tamen, ut Filium Petri Leonis ejusque complices anathematizent, mihique ac successoribus meis obedientiam promittant. Ista dum Imperatori placuissent, beatae Martyris Simphorosae die misit Imperator Rainerum cum electo & fratribus Heinricum Ducem generum suum, Conradum Ducem, nepotem Henrici 5. Imperatoris, Ottonem Consobrinum suum, omnesque Archiepiscopos, Episcopos, Comites, Duces, ac Ro∣mani Imperii Proceres. Cumque Papae tentorium appropinquassent, Cardinales occurrentes interrogabant, Sifilium Petri Leonis renuere paratus esset? Quo sum ille annuisset, protinus electum in hac verba jurare fecerunt. Ego Rai∣naldus
refuto et anathematizo Schisma omne, et omnem Haeresim extollentem se adversus Sanctam et Apostolicam Ecclesiam. A∣nathematizo etiam filium Petri Leonis, et Rogerium Siciliae Comitem, omnesque illorum complices, et obediens ero Domino Papae Inno∣centio, et Successoribus suis canonice intrantibus. Cumque Rainal∣dus in haec verba jurasset, reliquos (Monachos) similiter jurare cogebant. Illi au∣tem Patri Benedicto ejusque successoribus se jurasse, atque ideo Sacramentum se exhi∣bere non posse dicebant. Tunc Rainaldus, ex parte Patris Benedicti, ac sua praecepit, ut obedientiam, quam B. Benedicto ejusque successoribus sibique exhibuerant, in manu Pa∣pae promitterent. Sicque constricti fratres, quod electus ad Evangelia, hoc illi juxta teno∣rem Chartulae in manu Episcopi Hostiensis juraverunt, adjectoque hoc insuper, Quod siCasinensis à Romana Ecclesia divisa fuerit, ego in Monasterio non remanebo, neque Abbati obediam, salva Romani Imperii fidelitate. Haec ubi ad Papae libitum impleta sunt, ab excommunicationis nexu absoluti, nudis pedibus ad Papae vesti∣gia, deinde ad osculum recepti sunt. Petrum vero Draconum Innocentius ad se evocans dixit: Praecipio tibi in virtute Spiritus Sancti, & per Sacramentum, quod hodiè mihi & successoribus meis praestitisti, te ajuro, ut quacunque hora literas vel nuncium meum acceperis; non habes licentias ultra remorandi: sed quamprimum poteris vestigiis sedis Apostolicae & Pontificis, qui pro tempore fuerit, te representare studeas. Nolo enim ut pia Romana Ecclesia inquietetur. Post haec Rainaldus ad Imperatorem deductus, & ab eo magno cum honore susceptus, cum fratribus inter Imperii Capellanos constitutus est. Nam usque ad eam diem Imperatoris obtutibus praesentatus non fuerat. Aalvolis ta∣men posta in suspicionem adductus, singulari Papae livore depositus est. Such was this Popes Christian candor, charity, fidelity towards him, after this solemn re∣conciliation, notwithstanding the Emperors mediation. And to demonstrate his unparalled ingratitude to the Emperor, who with extraordinary expence and tra∣vel had twice by force of Armes suppressed his Competitor, and restored him to his Papal Authority,Chronicon Casinense, l. 4. c. 118. Cent. Magd. 12. c. 8. col, 1166. Cum se Salernitani Imperatori victorioso Lothario dederent, Papa indigne tulit, quod Imperator eos suos esse assereret, Pa∣pa enim contendebat, eos sui juris esse; Which the Emperor would not admit: As for his antient Right of Investitures, and bestowing Bishopricks in Germany, he strenuously maintained it, as this president amongst others demon∣strates.

After his death,Sigeberti Chronicon, An. 1134. p. 13. Cent. Magd. 12 col. 1162. Nortbertus Innocentii Papae Catholici aequissimus fautor, Petri verò Scismatici justissimus execrator, dying in Italy, de exuviis Nortberti posteà intr Clericos majoris Ecclesiae & fratres Sanctae Mariae contentio gravis exoritur (non de Doctrina, de qua nihil erant sollici) quam quidem solus Imperator Lotharius potuit dirimere: Res ad Imperatorem delata est, et ejus praecepto, cadaver fratribus Sanctae Mariae attribuitur, quia Monachus extiterit; & cum filiis & fratribus quos in Christo genuerat, in Ecclesiae Sanctae Mariae (quam Christo aedificaverat) sepultus est. How corrupt, unjust, this Pope, his Cardinals, and the Court of Rome were, & how ingratefull they proved even to St. Bernard himself, after all his travel and pains for them; his Epistles to them thus relate to posterity.Bernardi E∣pist. 158, 159. ad Dominum Papam Inno∣centium. Thomas Prior S. Victoris in France; Vir religiosus, in itinere quod induxerat pietas, in opere sancto, in sanctorum Comitatu, in Dominico die, certe in sinu Episcopi Parisiensis, & inter manus ejus, crudeliter ab impiis excerebratus est, by the instigation of another Clergyman of Noble extraction; who to secure himself from legal proceedings in France for this murder, appealed to Pope Innocent, and there found favour and protection; Of which St. Bernard thus complained to this Pope; In quantam misera devenit amentiam, ut fera pessima quae devoravit Joseph, vaga & profuga, & tremens super terram, illuc potissimum fu∣gam inerit, ubi plus timere oportuit? Sceleratissime, tu summae aequi∣tatis sedem, putas esse speluncam latronum, aut cubile leonum, &c. Ss inquam impunè ferat, quod utique mira impudentia de vestra Apostolica Authori∣tate praesumit, quanta putamus impunitas ista in Ecclesia parturiet punienda unum de duobus fore, necesse est, aut nullos ex nobilibus sive potentibus secundum hoc
seculum, admitti deinceps ad honores Ecclesiasticos; aut passim ad omne illicitum permitti libere Clericos sacris abuti officiis, ne fortè si quispiam Zelo Dei accensus prohibere tentaverit, ferro illico militari reus justitiae trucidetur. Atque ita quid spirituali gladio, quid censurae Ecclesiasticae, quid Christianae legis & disciplinae, quid reverentiae sacerdotali, quid denique divino timori relinquitur, si metu poten∣tiae secularis nullus mutire jam audeat contra insolentiam Clericorum? Quid enim insolentius, quidve indignius in Ecclesia esse potest, quam ut sibi quisque Ecclesi∣asticas vendicet dignitates seritate armorum, non morum probitate? Quamobrem Domine Pater, aliquid ut videtis prorsus decernendum in hominem quod Ecclesiae prosit, ut salus facta hoc tempore per vos transfundatur in posteros, & cognos∣cat generatio altera non solum quod fuit praesumptum, sed & qualiter ultum. Alioquin si serpat venenum, nec sequatur pariter antidotum, multos (quod absit) habeat perimere. Yet his 160, 161, 162, & 163 Epistles prove, that contra jus et fas this murderer found protection at Rome, and so escaped unpunished. In his Epist. 166. ad Dominum Papam Innocentium (to whom he had complain∣ed at large in his 164. Epistle, of the fraud, rashnesse, injustice of the election and consecration of the unworthy Bishop of Lingon, against the Archbishops, Deans and Canons promises to him, and this Popes command, without the least redresse upon several Appeals to him against his election) he writes thus; Iterum clamo, iterum pulso, & si non clamosis vocibus, certè lachrymosis gemitibus; cogit iterare clamores, iterata in nos injuria perditorum & prolongantium iniquitatem suam. Confortati sunt ad∣dentes praevaricationem. Apponunt iniquitatem super iniquitatem, & superbia eo∣rum ascendit semper. Invaluit furor, pudor evanuit, & timor Dei. Quem contra tuam, Pater, castam justamque dispositionem non timuerunt eligere, etiam post Ap∣pellationem tui nominis ausi sunt execrare. Et hoc praesumpserunt Lugdunensis, Edunensis, Matisconsis, ac amici Cluniacensis. In fraude & temeritate istorum heu quam ingens multitudo sanctorum turbabitur, si angariati fuerint tali portare jugum taliterque impositum. Proh nefas, hoc ita accepturi sunt, ac si cogantur ge∣nua curvare Baal,Esay 28 aut certe juxta prophetam, pactum facere cum morte, & cum inferno fedus inire. Rogo ubijus, ubi lex, ubi sacrorum auctoritas Canonum, ubi denique reverentia Majestati? Illa, illa, quae nulli negatur oppresso, soli mihi non profuit Appellatio, Vbi nimirum imperabat aurum, judicabat argentum, leges Canonesque silebant, locum ratio et aequitas non habebant. Eisdem telis (quod intollerabilius est) arcem quoque Apostolici culminis oppugnare minantur. Id vero ridicu∣lum; Fundaeta est enim supra firmam Petram. Sed quid ago? Excessi fateor; non est meum accusare quemquam aut reprehendere; sufficit mihi ut plangam dolorem meum Post longam moram multosque labores quos pro servitio Romanae Ecclesiae pertuli, cum tandem placuit Serenitati vestrae reditum annue∣re ad fratres meos, etsi fractus viribus Corporis tanquam malè operans, laetus tamen ob manipulos pacis, quos reportabam, ad Monasterium cum prosperitate perveni. Credidi me de labore evasisse ad requiem, licere mihi utcunque resarcire spirituali∣um damna studiorum, ac sanctae quietis detrimenta quae foris incurreram; et ecce tribulatio et angustia invenerunt me: En lectulo recubantem plus Cordis quam corporis dolor excruciat. Nec enim Ego deploro tem∣porale incommodum ullum; Anima mea in manibus meis, salus ejus in causa est. Placet vobis, ut illi homini credam animam meam, qui perdidit suam? Scio quod non placet. Quamobrem dixi animae meae, expedire magis inire fugam quam & maerore consumere residuum dierum meorum, & nihilominus in periculum solertis incidere. At Deus vobis potius inspiret, quod potius est, reducere (viz.) ad memoriam (si dignum judicatis) qualiter vobiscum egerim, & ponere oculos pietatis super puerum vestrum, & liberare afflictum de angustia; quin potius non oblivisci, quanta Deus ipse fecerit vobis, & in quantulecunque vicem recompensationis, ad ipsius gloriam, quod tam perperam factum est, revocare. This businesse he again pressed to this Pope, Epist. 167. concluding it thus, Nisi isti à tam scelerato, tamque temerario ausu deficiant (ut meipsum nunc sentio) deficiet in dolore vita mea; & anni mei in gemitibus: Which he thus backed with anEpist. 168. Epistle Ad Episcopos & Cardinales Romanae Curiae; Vos scitis, si dignum ducitis recordari, quali∣ter
vobiscum in tempore malo conversatus sim, egrediens & regrediens, & pergens ad imperium Regis:Ps. 114. persistens ac permanens vobiscum in tentationibus vestris, ita ut consumptis penè viribur corporis, vix post redditam caelitus pacem Ecclesiae repa∣triare potuerim. Et recolo hoc non glorians, aut improperans, sed provocans & efflagitans, monens & reposcens debitum vestrae miserationis affectum. Urget necessitas modo omnes repetere debitores. Ego vero si feci quod facere debui, haud aliud me ex eo quàm servum inutilem reputo, juxta sermonem Domini. Ve∣runtamen si feci quod oportuit, aut quod faciendum fuit, nunquid merui vapula∣re? Et ecce rediens a vobis tribulationem et dolorem inveni, et no∣men Domini (to wit, Innocentii Papae) invocavi, sed non profuit. In∣vocavi et vestrum, et non valuit. Siquidem Dii fortes terrae vehementer ele∣vati sunt,Ps. 49. 6. Lugdunensis scilicet Achiepiscopus, & Cluniacensis Abbas. Hi confiden∣tes in virtute sua, & in multitudine divitiarum suarum gloriantes, adversum me ap∣propinquaverunt & steterunt: Et non adversum me tantum, sed adversum mag∣nam multitudinem servorum Dei, adversum vos, quoque adversum seipsos, contra Deum, contra omnem aequitatem et honestatem. Denique imposuerunt hominem super capita nostra, quem, proh pudor! & boni horrent, & mali rident. Quo ordine, imo quàm extraordinariè, videat Deus & judicet: Videat, et doleat Romana Curia: Videat, misereatur et accinga∣tur ad vindictam malefactorum, laudem vero honorum. Quid enim? Placet tibi, domina mundi universitati constituta est, vindex in iram, judex in miseriam, placet inquam, tibi quod dum superbit impius, incenditur pauper, & ille pauper qui pro tuo servitio, cum non haberet Censum quam effunderet, sanguini non pepercit? Dignum ne tibi videtur tua perfrui pace, & nostram non curare, nec recipere in sor∣tem consolationis quos habuisti consortes laboris? Si inveni gratiam in oculis ve∣stris, Ps. 35: 10. eripite inopem de manu fortiorum ejus, egenum & pauperem, ab eripientibus eum. Alioquin ego quidem ut potero laborabo in gemitu meo, & erunt mihi la∣chrymae meae panes die ac nocte,Job 6. vobis autem legem illum versiculum, Qui tollit ab amico miseriam,Psal. 37. timorem Domini derelinquit. Et illud, omnes necessarii mei recesserunt à me. Illud quoque, Qui juxta me erant de longe steterunt, & vim faciebant, qui quae∣rebant animam meam. In his 178 Epistle ad Dominum Papam Innocentium, pro Alberone Treverensi Ar∣chiepiscopo, he writes thus; Querimonia Domini Treverensis non est ejus solius, sed communis multurum, eorumque praecipuè qui sinceriori affectu vos diligunt; Vor una omnium qui fideli apud nos cura populis praesunt, justici∣am in Ecclesia deperire; Annullari Ecclesiae Claves; Episcopalem omnino vilescere authoritatem, dum nemo Episcoporum in promp∣tu habeat ulcisci injurias Dei; nulli liceat illicita quaevis, ne in propria quidem Parochia castigare. Causam referunt in vos, Cu∣riamque Romanam. Recte gesta ab ipsis, (ut aiunt) destruitis: ju∣ste destructa, statuitis; Quique flagitiosi et contentiosi de populo, si∣ve de Clero, aut etiam ex Monasteriis pulsati currunt ad vos, re∣deuntes jactant et gestiunt se obtinuisse tutores, quos magis ultores sensisse debuerunt; An non gladius Phinees promptissimè at{que} justissimè eductus fuerat, ad condemnandum incestuosum concubitum Drogonis & Milis? sed confusis atque retusus abiit retrorsum: Scuto nimirum Apostolicae defensionis opposito. Proh pudor! quos Cachinnos res ista movit, et movet Ecclesiae inimicis, eisque etiam ipsis quorum fortasse metu aut favore a recto tramite abducti sumus? Amici confunduntur, fidelibus insultatur, Episcopi ubique in opprobrium veniunt et contemptum, quorum dum recta judicia contemnuntur, vestrae quoque plurimum deroga∣tur Auctoritati. Ipsi sunt enim qui honorem vestrum zelant, qui vestra pro pace, & exaltatione laborant fideliter quidem, sed vereor ne inefficaciter. Quid vobis vires minuitis? quid robur vestrum deprimitis? Quousque retunditis arma fidelia militantia vobis; humiliatis cornua erecta vestrae virtutis, & salutis? Plorans plorat desolationem suam apud Tullum Ecclesia Sancti Gengulsi, nec est qui consoletur eam. Quis enim se opponat brachio excelso, torrentis impetui, summae arbitrio potestatis? &c. Which he thus aggravates in his 179 Epistle to him. Quomodo malitia vin∣cit
sapientiam? Nosti pie Domine, nosti Treverensem Archiepiscopum? Scio quod nosti. Nosti & illum Sancti Maximini non sanctum Abbatem? Puto quia non no∣sti. Quis dignior honore illo priori? Sic nemo confusione digmor isto sequenti, & tamen iste honoratus est, ille opprobriodatus. Quid peccavit Archiepiscopus, praedam Ec∣clesiae suae recuperavit, captivam Ecclesiam de manu Laica liberavit, &c. In his 180 Epistle to him, he shewes how Popes and the Court of Rome did oft times erre in their determinations by misinformations. Iterum supplicatio, iterum pre∣ces, & decies repetitae te non desinent. Non desistimus, quia non diffidimus. Bonam causam habemus, et aequum judicem qui non cunctabitur evacuare quod subreptum est, cum apparebit quod verum est: nec poterit in∣de ridere qui voluit irridere, sed ut scriptum est, Mentita est ini∣quitas sibi. Hoc solet habere praecipuum Apostolica sedes, ut non pigeat revocare quod a se forte deprehenderit fraude elicitum, non veritate promeritum. Res plena aequitate, & laude digna, ut de mendacio nemo lucretur, praesertim apud Sanctam & summam Sedem. But notwithstanding all St. Bernards importunate successive Letters, Merits, Piety, the Justice of his own and others causes he recommended to this Pope Innocent, his Cardinals and Chancel∣lor, the heavier purse overballanced them, and carried the cause, though never so unjust or irregular, during this Popes domination, as well as his predecessors; as these Epistles and other Testimonies evidence. In his 213 Epistle ad Dominum Papam Innocentium, he thus expostulates with him for his Injustice, in styling him a Traytor to him; Quis mihi faciat Justitiam de vobis? Si haberem judicem ad quem vos trahere possem, jam nunc ostenderem vobis quid meremini: Extat quidem Tribunal Christi; sed absit, ut ad illud appellem vos, quia il∣lic si vobis necessarium, & mihi possibile esset, vellem magis totis viribus stare, & re∣spondere pro vobis. Itaque recurro ad cum cui in praesenti datum est judicare de Ʋniver∣sis; hoc est, ad vos: Vos appello ad vos; vos judicate inter me & vos. In quo quaeso puer vester tàm malè meruit de vestra Paternitate, ut eum inurere et insignire pla∣ceret nota et nomine proditoris? &c. Quisnam ergò constantiae vestrae, suo consilio, vel magis suo dolo subripuit, indulta repetere, & quae processêre de labiis vestris facere irri∣ta? Epist. 216, 217. he writes to this Pope, Scriptum est, Quod Deus conjunxit, homo ne separet.Mat. 19. Surrexerunt viri audaces qui non timuerunt conjunctos à Deo contra Deum disjungere: Neque id solum, insuper & adjecerunt conjungere non conjungendos, addentes praevaricationem. Lacerantur sacra Ecclesiae, scinduntur proh dolor vestes Iesu Christi, idque ad cumulum doloris ab his a quibus resarciri debu∣erint: Amici tui Deus, & proximi tui adversum te appropinquaverunt & steterunt, &c. Comitem Radulphum & unxorem ejus, Deus conjunxerat per Ministros Ecclesiae, & Ecclesia per Deum,Psal. 37, qui dedit talem potestatem hominibus: Quomodo quos Deus con∣junxit, disjunxit camera? In quo facto illud solum convenienter provisum est quod in tene∣bris facta sunt opera tenebrarum.Joan. 3. 20. Qui enim malè agit odit lucem, & non venit ad lucem, ut non arguantur opera ejus a luce. Quid meruit Comes Theobaldus? Quid peccavit homo ille? Si peccatum est, quod diligit justitiam, & odit iniquitatem, non potest excusari. Si peccatum est, quod reddit Regi quae Regis sunt, & quae sunt Dei, Deo; non potest excusari. SiSee here, p. 28. Archiepiscopum Bituricensem suscepit ad Imperium vestrum, hoc est maximum & primum peccatum: En sanguis iste de manu ejus exquicitur, &c. Tribulatio & angustia invenerunt nos: Ipsa religio venit in opprobrium & contemptum. Probro ducitur apud nos saltem mentionem facere pacis: Nusquam fides, nusquam innocentia tuta. Amator innocentiae, pietatis cultor Comes Theobaldus penè tradi∣tus in animam inimicorum ejus: And in his excusatory last Epistle to this Pope he thus complains he was fallen quite out of his favour (only for his just reprehen∣sions of his Injustice, abuses, and disobeying his unjust commands.) Domino & Patri Reverendissimo Innocento B. nihilum id quod est.Epistola 218. Putabam me aliquando aliquid vel modicum esse; Sed nunc ut sentio prorsus ad nihilum redactus sum, dum nescivi. Nec e∣nim me dixerim omnino nihilum tunc fuisse, cum oculi Domini mei super puerum suum essent, & aures ejus ad preces meas; cum omne quod scriberem obviis manibus accepisset, & vultu hilari perlegisset, benignissimè atque plenissimè ad omnia postulata respondens. Modò autem me merito non modicum dico, sed nihilum, quoniam ab heri & nudiuster∣tius avertit faciem suam à me. Cur hoc? Quid peccavi? Multum fateor, si pecunia Cardinalis Yvonis bonae memoriae meo arbitrio distributa fuit, & non ad nutum ipsius, quod utique ad aures Domini mei fuisse perlatum, mihi relatum est which act he justified,
referring the Pope to his forecited Epistle written to his four Cardinals: In fine, he thus complaines ofEpistola 182. Henry the Archbishop of Sienna his pro∣ceedings, just like the Popes and Court of Rome, Multiplicatis vobis ac∣cusatores, defensatores subtrahitis; Provocatis adversarios, patronos offenditis: Vbique apud vos pro ratione voluntas; totum pro imperio, nihil pro timore Dei. Qui de vobis non rident inimici, non conquerun∣tur amici? Quomodo devestitis hominem, non dico judicio non convictum, sed nec verbo conventum? Quantus hoc verbum scandaliza∣bit? quot ora ad subsannandum? quot corda ad succendendum movebit? Itane puta∣tis periisse justitiam de toto orbe, sicut de vestro corde, et homo sic ablatum perdat Ar∣chidiaconatum? &c. Haec vobis mordacius audaciusque quàm velletis audire scripsi, sed non ad insipientiam vobis si velietis corrigere. That the Kings of France maintained, exercised their antient right of Invest∣ing of Bishops and Abbots by a Ring and Pastoral Staff, and usually gave their Royal assents to and confirmed their elections, under Pope Innocent and his Pre∣decessors, notwithstanding all their Canons to the contrary, is evident by these Passages in St. Bernard, (no Friend to Investitures) who informs us in general: In caena Domini, De Baptismo, &c. Serm. 2. f. 31. L. M. Multa siquidem facta propter se tantum; alia verò propter alia designanda, & ipsa dicuntur signa, & sunt; ut enim de usualibus sumamus exemplum; datur annulus absolute propter annulum, & nulla est significatio: datur ad investiendum de haereditate aliqua, & signum est, ita ut jam dicere posset quid accepit: Anulus non valet quicquam, sed haereditas est quam quaerebam. Variae sunt investiturae secundum ea dequibus investimur: Verbi gra∣tia: investitur Canonicus per Librum; Abbas per Baculum, Episcopus per Annulum & Baculum. In his 164. Epistle to Pope Innocent concerning the Cause of the Bishoprick of Lingon pending by Appeal before him he informs him, that the Bishop of Lingon being elected, against the consent of the Dean and others, yea against the Popes Order & Electors promise to him; the Archbp. of Lyons upon St. Bernards importuni∣ty refusing to consecrate him; he thereupon privily procured an Investiture from the King, and then was ordered to be consecrated at another day and place: Interim nempe homo qui & consecrationem fugerat & electionem refutat, festinavit ad Regem; Regalium investituram obtinuit, quibus meritis ipse viderit: Mox directis Epistolis, & locus qui assignatus fuerat, est mutatus, & dies anticipatus, ut loci temporisque opportunitate substracta, & copia agendi pariter, subtrahatur contradictu∣ris, & consecrationis dies subripiatur appellaturis. Caeterum non est consilium contra con∣silium Domini, cujus providentia factum est ut nec contradictores defuerint nec appel∣latores. Appellatum est à Falcone Decano Lugdunensis Ecclesiae, &c. and others to the Pope against his Consecration. St. Bernard, as he writ several Epistles to the Pope in favour of the Appellants, so he sent anEpist. 170. Epistle ad Ludovicum juniorem Francorum Re∣gem, desiring him to revoke his Investiture granted to this Bishop being unduly ele∣cted, and unfit for that Charge, and to invest the Bishop duly elected by the contra∣ry Party; Which begins thus: Si totus orbis adversum me conjuraret, ut quippiam moliter adversus Regiam majestatem, ego tamen Deum timerem, ac ordina∣tum ab eo Regem offendere temere non auderem: Nec enim ignaro ubi legerim; qui potestati resistit, Dei ordinationi resistit, &c. Non imminuetur honor Regis, regnique utilitas per nos: Nam in quo alio regia majestas; recte in eo quod factum est imminuta dicatur? Electio rite celebrata est; electus fidelis est; Non esset fidelis si vestra autem et non per vos habere vellet. Necdum ad vestra manum extendit, necdum civitatem vestram ingressus est, necdum prorsus se intrusit de aliquo, quanquam invitatio Cleri & Populi, & oppressorum afflictio, & vota bonorum id ab eo vehementissimè flagitarint, &c. Quae cum ita sint, opus est, ut videtis, maturatione consilii, non minus vestro honori, quam nostrae necessitati: & nisi per praesen∣tes nuncios expectanti populo, qui vester est, Serenitas vestra pro voto responderit, multo∣rum religiosorum adversum vos (quod non expedit) devota vobis nunc corda turbabitis, et regalibus vestris ipsis, quae ad Ecclesiam pertinent, non parvum, ut veremur, in∣commodum acquiretis.c Rom. 19. In another Epistle Ludovico Regi Francorum pro electo Antisiodorensi,Epistola 282. he writes thus of the usual Elections of Bps. in France, the Kings Prerogative to grant Licenses and ap∣prove elections when made, & differences likely to arise between the King and Pope in case of a Provision by the Pope without the King Volui ego unquam in aliquo imminui
honorem Regis, dignitatem regni? Deus scit, nec vestra ut confido conscientia id vobis respondet. Videte ne illi magis contra vos faciant qui electio∣nes disturbant, ne sint in Ecclesiis qui serviant Regi, sed ipsis de Ec∣clesiarum redditibus serviatur. Ego, ego electioni Antisiodorensi interfu; concors fuit: quia Clerici qui ante hac in partes dissilierant, sixe contradictione nunc tandem, Deo mi∣serante convenerunt. Electum benè novimus, testimonium ei perhibemus, quoniam bonus est. Neminem prorsus arbitror affuisse illi celebritati qui de assensu vestro dubitaret, cum jam idem assensus vestris literis teneretur. Quis enim hoc vel cogitare posset, repetendum alterum assensum, nec sufficere u∣num; praesertim ubi nulla extunc intervenit altera electio? Nun∣quid quociens dissenserint Clerici, totiens erit requirendus favor Regis? Nec ratio, nec consuetudo hoc habet. Denique nuper, si recordamini, in Sessio∣nensi Ecclesia quotiens ad eligendum Clerici convenerunt, quotiens disserserunt, & in∣fecto negotio discesserunt, nec tamen existimo totiens repetisse assensum vestrum quem semel promeruerant. Ita est Dominus Rex, non est quod debea∣tis reprobare factas electiones quibus ut fierent semel vos assensisse constiterit. Sed sunt aliqui qui vos conturbant, & conturbaremtuntur Ecclesias, sua lu∣cra sectantes; quodque gravius est, summi Pontificis et Serenissimi Regis mutuam gratiam et amorem Diabolico studio dirumpere molientes. Absit hoc: judicium portabunt quicunque sunt illi, et Rex semper faciet quod bonus Rex sicut hactenus fecit. Itaque citò mandentur jocundiora, ne diutius sedeat in tristitia Ecclesia tamdiu jam vexata & afflicta. De persona nulla subeat suspicio, aut ego nimium fallor, aut fidelis erit, et Regi beneplacitum superea. Consido in Domino quod non contristabitis multitudinem Sanctorum qui sunt in illo Episcopatu, nec me servum vestrum, qui, ut verum fatear, nihil aequè unquam à vobis molestum pertuli, quàm si in hoc consilio quod non eveniat, praestiteritis. The Continuator of Sigeberts Chronicle (Robertus de Monte) informs us;Anno 1241. f. 139. b. & An. 1243. f. 140. Centur. Magd. 12. c. 10. col. 1248. that Anno 1241. there arose a great difference between this Pope and the King of France, by reason of his making and consecrating one Peter Archbishop of Bituris by his Provision, without the Kings consent. Orta dissensione inter Papam Romanum, & Francorum Regem Ludovicum Ecclesia Gallicana turbatur. Defuncto enim Alberico Bituricensi Archiepiscopo, missus est Petrus a Papa Innocentio eidem Ec∣clesiae Pastor consecratus, sed a Rege Ludovico repudiatus, eo quod sine ejus assensu fuerit ordinatus, in Civitatem minime recipitur; cujus partes quia propter reverentiam seu voluntatem Papae Comes Theobaldus fovere videbatur, simultas quae sopita pu∣tabatur inter Regem et ipsum coepit repullulare: The King besieging his Castles, and raising War against him as a Traytor, for receiving and assisting this Pseu∣do-Archbishop Peter, by the Popes command, burning a Church & no lesse then 1300 soules therein in his Castle of Vitriacum, which he took by force; for which he was sharply reprehended by St.See Bernardi Epist. 216, 217. 219, 220, 221, & here, p. 378. Bernard,† Hist. Angl. Ann. 1146. p. 77. Philip de Mornay, Hist. Papatus, p. 300 & excommunicated by Pope Innocent. After this (asRex Francorum Lodowicus à Papa Eugenio excommunica∣tus. Mat. Paris informs us) An. 1146. Eodem Anno Papa Eugenius Parisiis veniens, con∣secravit Petrum quendam Aimerici Ecclesiae Romanae Cancellarii nepotem, in Archiepis∣copum Bituricensem. contra Lodowici Regis Franciae voluntatem. Quod Rex injuria suae dignitatis factum vehementer indignans, propositis publice sacrosanctis reliquiis, in praesentia multorum juravit, quod Ar∣chiepiscopus praefatus, quamdiu ipse viveret, Civitatem Bituri∣cam non intraret. Sic per triennium Regis persona subjacuit in∣terdicto. In quamcunque civitatem, vicum vel castellum intrabat, suspendebatur celebratio divinorum. (Such was the atheism of these Popes to preferr every punctilio of their own absolute wills and usurpations, before the Sacred publike Worship of God himself, and the peoples salvation) Tandem Ber∣nardi Abbate Claravallensi persuadente ad hoc, est Cor Regis inclinatum, ut Ar∣chiepiscopum reciperet, et pro transgressione perjurii, Hierosolymam se promitteret profecturum. Igitur per totam Galliam, fit exactio generalis, nec genus, vel ordo, aut dignitas, quempiam excusavit,
quin auxilium Regi conferret. Vnde factum est, ut ejus peregri∣natio multis imprecationibus persequeretur. A remedy farr worse then the disease, and an over-dear compensation for his perjury in departing with an antient royal indisputable prerogative, against his solemn Oath. The Letter of St Bernard to the Church of Rome in the behalf of this young King, is very remarkable; wherin he excuseth the rashnesse and temerity of his forecited Oath, by the custom, generosity of the French Nation, the youth and courage of the King;Epist. Bernardi 219. fol. 220. Num. 16. thereby in a manner betraying the rights of the Crown of France, to the usurpations of this tyrannizing Pope. Quantum malum schisma in Ecclesia, & quam sit detestandum, & omnimodis devitandum, evidenter quondam ostendit famsae & hor∣renda mors virorum illorum quos ob istiusmodi pestem terra deglutiens, vivos transmisit ad inferos; ostendit & illa persecutio Guibertina, sive Burdini temeritas quae nostrae jam tempora experta sunt, inter Regnum & Sacerdotium dividentes, plaga penè incurabili, & castigatione crudeli. Ostendit & illa quae nuper adhuc post multam & multifariam Ecclesiae vexationem,Mat. 18. 7. & vastationem, tandem Deo miserante nem accepit, rabies Leo∣nina. Merito proinde Salvater in Evangelio, Vae (inquit) homi illi, per quem scan∣dalum venit; Vae vobis qui vivimus plangere quae pertulimus, dolcre quae sentimus, ti∣mere quae expectamus. Et quod pejus est, ad tam malum habitum humanae res devene∣runt, ut nec rei humiliari velint, nec Judices misereri. Dicimus, iniquis, nolite iniquè agere,Psal. 74. & delinquintibus, Nolite exaltare cornu, & non audiunt nos quia domus exasperans est.Luke 17. Supplicamus his quorum est peccata arguere, peccantes ser∣vare, Ne calamum quassatum conterant, & linum fumigans non extinguant, & magis in Spiritu vehementi conterunt Naves Tharsis.Isay 42. Si denunciamus filiis cum Apostolo, ut obediant patribus per omnia, quasi acrem verberamus;Ephes. 6. Si Pa∣tribus loquimur, ne ad indignationem provocent filios, in nos potius eorum indignatio∣nem provocamus. Nec delinquentes satisfacere, nec Rectores seu correctores condescen∣dere ullatenus acquiescunt. Omnes suum stomachum sequuntur & totis viribus funem in diversa trahentes, rumpunt. Heu nec dum recenti Ecclesiae plagae cicatrix occalluit, & rur∣sum scindere parant, rursus Corpus Christi assigere cruci, rursus fodere latus innoxium, rursus vestimenta dividere atque ipsam quod in ipsis est tunicam inconsutilem (quamvis frustra) dirumpere satagunt. Si qua in vobis sunt viscerae pietatis, tantis vos opponite malis, ne in illa praecipuè terra scissura fiat in qua solent sicut optime nostis scissurae aliae re∣sarciri. Nam si author scandali, ore singulariter judicis tremendo addicitur maledicto, quibus putamus benedictionibus dignos hujus nequitiae fugatores & propugnatores? De duobus non excusamus Regem, nam et juravit illicite, et perseve∣rat injuste. Verum id non voluntate, sed vere cundia. Nam pro∣bro ducitur, sicut optime nostis, apud Francigenas juramentum sol∣vere quamlibet male publice juratum sit, quamvis nemo sapiens dubitet illicita juramenta non esse tenenda. Veruntamen ne in hoc quidem excusari posse fatemur, neque enim excusare nos, sed veniam postulare suscepimus. Vos videte an excusare aliquatinus eum possit ita, aetas, et Majestas. Poterit sine dubio, si misericordiam judicio superexaltandam decernatis, quatinus videlicet, talis aliqua consideratio in Rege et puero habeatur, ut hac ei vice tali quidem tenore parcatur, quo tale aliquid de caetero non praesumat. Par∣catur sanè dixerim, si fieri possit (salva in omnibus Ecclesiae libertate) simul & Archiepiscopo debita veneratione servata, quae manus Apostolica consecravit. Hoc ipse Rex humiliter petit, hoc nostra universa citramontana nimium jam afflicta Ecclesia suppliciter deprecatur. Alioquin damus manus morti, tabescentes & arescentes prae ti∣more & expectatione quae supervenerunt universo Orbi. Siquidem deprecatio mea super hoc ab anno priore, & peccatis meis exigentibus deprecationem meam non exauditio, sed indignatio, indignationem autem desolatio pene universae terrae secuta est. Si∣quid Zelo urgente erupit, quod non fuit, aut secus quam fuit dicendum, sit quaeso apud vos quasi non dictum. Ʋbi vero dixi, quod oportuit, & ubi oportuit dici, sit non frustra dictum. As for Kings Supremacy over Archbishops, Bishops, Clergy-men, their due Sub∣jection, and paying Tribute to them, as well as Abbots Subjection to their Diocaesan Bishop in that age, St. Bernard thus notably proves it from Christs own Precept, President, and the Centurions in the Gospel;Bernardi Ep. 42. ad Henric Senonensem Archiepiscopū. Nolite illorum acquiescere consiliis, qui cum sint Christiani, Christi tamen vel sequi facta vel obsequi dictis opprobrio ducunt. Ipsi sunt qui vobis dicere solent, Servate vestrae sedis honorem. Decebat quidem ex vo∣bis,
vobis commissam Ecclesiam crescere, nunc vero saltem in illa quam sus∣cepistis maneat dignitate. Si non crescit per vos, non decrescat per vos. Christus aliter jussit, et gessit; Reddite, ait, quae sunt Caesaris Caesari, & quae sunt Dei Deo.Marc. 22. Quod ore locutus est, mox opere implere uravit: Condi∣tor Caesaris,Mat. 17. 25, 28. Caesari non cunctatus est reddere censum, exmplum e∣nim dedit vobis, ut et vos ita faciatis. Quomodo verò Di Sacerdotibus debitum negaret reverentiam, qui hanc secularibus quoque potestatibus exhibere curavit? Porro vos si Caesaris successori, i.e. Regi, sedulò in suis Curiis, consiliis, negotiis, exerci∣tibusque adestis, indignum erit vobis cuicunque Christi Vicario taliter exhibere, qualiter ab antiquo inter Ecclesias ordinatum est? Sed quae sunt (inquit Apostolus) potestates,Rom. 13. à Deo ordinatae sunt. Viderint ergo hujus ignominiae dissuasores, quale sit Dei ordinatio∣ni resistere. Valdè ignominiosum servo si sit sicut Dominus ejus. aut discipulo si sit sicut magister ejus. Plurimum se vobis deferre putant, cum vos Christo praeferre conantur, ipso reclamante ac dicente,ohn 13. Non est servus major Domino suo, neque Apostolus eo qui misit cum. Quod non dedignatus est Magister et Dominus, ta∣lisque et Magister et Dominus, indignum sibi judicabit servus bonus devotusque discipulus? Quàm pulchrè locutus est beatus ille Centurio, cujus fidei nulla par inventa est in Israel; Et ego (inquit) homo sum sub potestate, habens sub me Milites.. 7. 8. Non jactabat potestatem quam nec solam protulit, nec priorem. Dicturus quippe, habens sub me Milites, praemisit, homo sum, & homo sub potestate. Praemissa siquidem est humilitas, ne altitudo praecipitet. Dedit prius honorem prae positis, ut jam a subjectis juste reciperet, sciers se à supertoribus accipere quod impenderet inferioribus, & quia melius propriae subjectionis disceret experimen∣to sua ipse moderari imperia, &c. Miror quosdam in nostro ordine Monasteriorum Ab∣bates hanc humilitatis regulam odiosa contentione infringere, & sub humili (quod pejus est) habitu & tonsura, tàm superbè sapere, ut cum ne unum quidem verbulum de suis im∣periis subditos praetergredi patiantur, ipsi propriis obedire contemnant Episcopis: (yea Regibus & Principibus suis, of which he formerly discoursed;) spoliant Ecclesias t emancipentur; redimunt se ne obediant. Non ita Christus: Ille siquidem dedit vitam ne perderet obedientiam, quam illi, ut careant, totum ferè suum, suorumque victum expendunt. And did not Popes, Popish Prelates, Abbots then do so likewise, spending their own, and others revenues to exempt themselves from due obedience, taxes to their own Emperors and Christian Kings? Pope Innocent Anno 1143. having by the forces and valour of the Romans redu∣ced the Rebellious Tiburtes,Anno 1143. punished them farre lesse then they demerited,Carolus Sigo∣nius de Regno Italiae, l. 11. p. 275. and the Romans expected; whereupon, Romani, qui a parta victoria ferociores evaserant, & irati, acrbiore poena Tiburtes afficiendos putabant, à Pontifice flagitarunt, ne tantam defectionem tàm molli vindicasse conditione vellet; Tiburtes mernisse, ut muris disjectis è Latii finibus truderentur, ne{que} ipsum à defectionibus esse tutum futurum, nisi in auc∣tores eorum atrocius esse foret animadversum. Contra verò innocentius, postulatio∣nem eorum iniquam esse contendit, neque in dedititios, ac veniam pacemque petentes, tam acerbè consulere convenire, ab Ecclesia certè, quae communis omnium mater esset, tam acre vindicandae contumaciae studium abhorrere. Quod ubi Romani audiverunt, ira ve∣hementius exarsêrunt, quod neque hostes à quibus laesi essent, puniri pro libidine possent, neque aequi aliquid à Papa impetrarent, cui operam magno suo detrimento navassent. Ita∣que tumultu in urbe concitato, ac Civitate antiquo seditionis morbo furente, Concionem ex∣templo in Capitolio convocarunt. Ibi pro se quisque ferocissimè ac superbissimè est loqun∣tus, atque antiquam Romanorum animorum opemque magnitudinem ipsa verborum mag∣nificentia, atque orationis granditate est facile consecutus. Ad extremum multis dictis sen∣tentiis, omnes in eam quae maxime popularis, & splendida visa est, descenderunt. Ve∣terem Romanae libertatis statum restituendum; (being all weary of the Popes Tyranny, Vassallage, and resolving to shake off his usurped power over them) pristinos ordines, magistratusque Reipublicae reponendos, Pon∣tifici unam sacrorum curationem relinquendam in urbe esse. Hoc decus, hanc speciem dignitatis majores saepe, sed irrito in∣caepto tentasse; id eo sibi apud posteros splendidius ac magnificen∣tius fore, si ipsi tantam urbi laudem, majestatemque pepererint; pro certo autem parituros, si viribus suis agnitis parem ad caussam
animum, constantiamque attulerint. Ad hanc itaque opinionem ve∣nisse See p. 35. Arnoldi haeretici potissimum auctoritate videntur, cujus ejusmo∣di tum adversus Pontificem decreta vulgari hominum sermone celebrabantur. Itaque inita defectione, ordinem Senatorium jam∣pridem extinctum popularibus suffragiis revocarunt, ac bellum cum Tiburtibus renovarunt. Innocentius his rebus cognitis, primum per amicos summa au∣ctoritate praeditos Romanos redigere ad sanitatem contendit; deine ubi se incassum la∣bornare animadverterit, ad infesta edicta confugit, ac populum Romanum a sacris amovet, eum{que} Pontificiorum jure Comitiorum, cujus a primis tem∣poribus ad eum usque diem particeps fuerat, spoliavit. Verum nè ita quidem furorem sanare eorum potuit. Itaque in timorem Romani amit∣tendi Dominatus adductus, tantum ex ea re sollicitudinis hausit, ut langore confectus 8. Ralendas Octobris pericrit. Haec cum In∣nocentio instituta contentio tanti momenti fuit (as Sigonius observes) ut omnes deinde Pontifices usque ad Clementem tertium exercu∣erit. Sigonius l. 11. p. 276.

I shall only transcribe 2. Epistles of St. Bernard, the one to this Pope Caelestine himself, the other to the whole Court of Rome, in behalf of Henry Murdas the intruded Archbishop of Yorke, setting forth their grosse corruption, Injustice, and Pope Innocents too, with the mischief, and vexation of Appeals from forreign parts.Bernardi Epist. 234. See Godwins Cata∣logue of Bi∣shops, p. 456. Henry Murdac: Ad Dominum Papam Caelestinum, pro intruso Eboransi, Epist. 234. Oportet vos secundum ju∣stitiam quae ex lege est suscitare semen fratris vestri defuncti, quod dignè implebitur, si Papae Innocentio cui in haereditate Domini successistis, & defenditis benè gesta & minus adimpleta perficitis. Prae manibus est, in quo id liceat experiri. Causam Ebo∣racensis Ecclesiae per eum fuisse decisam quis nesciat? At quomodo executioni manda∣tum sit quod egressum est de labitis tanti viri? utinam nesciretur. Quis det ut non an∣nuncietur in Geth, neque in compitis Ascalonis! Sed ut verbum abbreviaum faciam auribus occupatis, audiat paucis Dominus meus quid dictum fuerit, & quid factum tu neamus. Cum in multis accusaretur is qui sili vendicare electionem in praefata Ecclesia impiè cupiebat, tandem omnis controversia ad testimonium viri illustris Willielmi ipsius Ecclesiae tunc Decani conquiescere jussa est, ut nisi capitulum intrusionis quod huic inter caetera impingebatur ille propriae manus juramento amoveret, suis omnino conaibus tanta frustraretur ambitio. Hoc autem non ex ju licio, sed ex misericordia. Sic enim rogave∣rat ipse. Mitissima plane sententia, quippe cum de plurimis & pessimis pulsaretur qua nullatenus propulsare valebat, sed utinam vel ipsa stet. Quid enim si non sufficit Iuri, dummodo sufficiat Ecclesiae liberationi? Non causamur sententiae remissionem quae nil nocuit.2 Reg. 1. Neque enm proficit adversario etsi lar∣gior indulgentia, qui ne ipsum quod ultro spoponderat implere praevaluit. Nam de quo praesumere visus est defecit ei ne sibi ipsi desiceret, ejerans. Quando enim vir bonus at∣testaretur homini, quem rumor publicae opinionis & operis veritas detestatur? Quid ergo? Ille non juravit, & iste Episcopus est? O rem ignorantia omnium dignam, et per∣petuo si fieri poset silentio comprimendam: Verum id sero, Heu notus est orbi triumphus Diaboli, ubique personat plausus incir∣cumcisorum et planctus bonorum, pro eo quod videatur sapientiam vicisse malicia. Monstratur digito matris Ecclesiae turpitudo, Patris Innocentii verenda irridentur denudata a servo nequam, quoniam mortuum putat, sed vivit in vobis. Si is exitus im∣minebat
cur e longinquo Romam est pertractata causa spurcissi∣ma, umbra magis ex angulo digna? Cur tanta mari terraque a multis assumpta fatigatio? Cur a finibus terrae evocati viri re∣ligiosi qui eum accusarent, et pauperum Christi marsupia longi iti∣neris expensis exhausta sunt? Non poterat Episcopari turpis in∣famisque persona (quod invitus dolensque loquor) nisi quam in illo horrebat Anglia, Francia abominabatur, etiam Roma cognosceret? Quanto melius in Romana Curia causa ejus minime ventilata fuisset: et non tangeret vel sacra limina generalis atque horribilis faetor? Quanto tolerabilius ignorasset Apostolica sedes tam into∣lerabile malum, quam tolerat manifestum? Quid istud temeritatis fuit? publice infamatus, ante indicem accusatus, nec purgatus, imo et convictus, et sic consecratus est? Viderit qui huic manum post ista imposuit, an magis execratus dicere debuerim. Non enim negabit sic se ista habere, non negabit si se er literis Apostolicis ad se pro hoc ipso directis eadem comperisse. Dicat fortè aliquis quod non est datum judicium, non fuisse convictum. Ego dico & confessum. Nam qui ut judicium evaderet, ultrò elegit ad testimonium Wilhelmi Decani confugere, illo sibi deficiente, quid risi suo judicio à cau∣sa decidit ore proprio condemnatus? Quae cum ità sint, Vide Domine Pater ne declinet cor vestrum in opus malitiae,Psal. 124. quoniam secundum Prophetam, declinan∣tes in obligatione adducet Dominus cum operantibus iniquitatem. Alioquin quod consilium datis missis Abbatibus illis quos ad accusandum eum vocatio Apostolica Roma∣na traxit, sed & aliis quampluribus ex illo Episcopatu viris religiosis, sint ne obedituri huic, & Sacramenta accepturi ab homine bis intruso? primo quidem per Regem, deinde per Legatum. Quippe qui illum in Sanctuarium Dei contra jus et fas, con∣tra mandatum Summi Pontificis in injuriam summae Sedis, et totius Romanae Curiae, cum non potuit per ostium, fodit argenteo (ut aiunt) sarculo, unde impudenter intrusit. Ante (nisi fallor) suis sedibus exulabunt, quam dare acquiescant manus Idolo huic, nisi vestra violenta authoritas obviarit. Caeterum quam Sanctiori ve∣stroque Apostolatu digniori zelo gladium Phinees in confusione duo∣rum tam turpiter fornicantium stringeretis, quam tot sanctos aut de suis fugere locis permittitis, aut contra conscientias suas co∣git remanere. His other Epistle Ad totam Curiam Romanam,Bernardi Epist. 235. fol. 222. runs thus; Dominis & Patribus reve∣rendis, Episcopis & Cardinalibus Curiae Romanae, frater B. Claravallis vocatus Ab∣bas salutem, & nostras qualescunque orationes. Omnibus scribendum fuit de eo quod spectat ad omnes. Nec vereor ne fortè praesumptionis arguar, quippe qui licet omnium minimus, tamen Romanae Curiae injuriam, a me non judico alienam. Vrimur assidue dico vobis, urimur graviter nimis, ita ut nos tae∣deat etiam vivere. In domo Dei videmus horrenda, et quod cor∣rigere nos non possumus, saltem suggerimus his ad quos spectat. Siquidem emendaverint benè; sin autem, nos animas nostras liberavimus, vos excusa∣tionem non habetis de peccato; Non ignoratis, prolatam esse sententiam à Domiao Papa bonae memoriae Innocentio, cum vestro & Romanae Curiae generali assensu, irri∣tam esse Wilhelmi Eboracensis electionem, immo intrusionem, nisi Wilhelmus alter, tunc Decanus, quod objectum ei fuerat, propriae manus juramento repelleret. Nec vos latuit quàm plena esset sententia, non judicii sed misericordiae, nimirum cum hoc Wilhel∣mus ipse quaesisset. Sed utinam vel ipsa stet, & quod adversus eam factum est stare non possit. Quid enim, Non juravit ille, et iste in Cathedra pestilentiae sedit? Quis tribuat ut adversus fornicationem hanc, Phinees cum pugione procedat, aut vivat in sede sua Petrus, qui Spiritu labiorum suorum interficiat impios? Multi clamant ad nos in toto corde suo: ut sacrilegium hoc digna animadversione vindicare studeatis. A∣lioquin
dico vobis scandalum magnum nimis erit in Ecclesia De, et timen ne Romanae sedis authoritas gravem admodum jacturam et detrimentum grande suscipiat, nisi in eum qui pervertit genera∣lem ejus sententiam vindicta processerit, et taliter ut caeteri me∣tum habeant. Quid enim de eo dicam, quam occultas, et vere tenebrosas literas habuisse se gloriatur Wilbelmus ille; utinam a Principibus terrarum, non a Principibus Apostolorum. Et ecce audierunt filii incircumcisorum, subsannant Romanam Curiam, a qua post datam tam manifestam sententiam furtim datas esse ai∣unt contrarias literas. Quid dicam vobis? Si non vos urit scan∣dalum grave quo scandalizantur, non pusilli, sed magni et perfe∣cti viri, si non compatimini pauperibus Abbatibus quos a finibus terrae vocatio Apostolica Romam traxit: si non miseremini mag∣nis et religiosis Monasteriis quibus omnino sub incubatore illo destructio imminet, si (quod primum dicere debui) Zelus domus Dei non comedit vos. Nunquid usque adeo inimici hominis versutia praevale∣bi, ut proprium quoque contemptum, et infamiam hanc pessi∣man Ecclesiae Principes aequanimiter ferant? Quid enim si sa∣crile gam homo ille consecrationem recepit? Profectò longè gloriosius, erit jam elevatum djicere Simonem, quam prohibere conantem. Alioquin, quid facie∣tis religiosis viris, qui omnino non inveniunt salva Conscientia; vel ipsa communia Sa∣cramenta de leprosa manu suscipere? Ante (nisi fallor) eligent fugre, quàm dare ma∣nus morti, & exulare priusquam vesci idoloticis. Quod si contra conscientias suas coegerit eos Romana Curia curvare genua ante Baal, vide∣at Deus et Iudicet, videat Curia illa caelestis, in qua nulla pote∣rit ambitione subverti judicium. In fine omnium obsecrat vos puer vester, per viscera misericordiae Dei nostri, si quis in vobis est Zelus Dei, miseremini Ecclesiae Sanctae saltem vos amici ejus, & quantum potestis date operam, ne tam detestabili facto detur assensus. But this Pope and the whole Court of Rome turning the deaf ear to these his Epistles; he thereupon (some years after) backed them with two other Epistles to Pope Eugenius, his Scholar, and familiar friend, which I shall here insert. Ad Dominum Papam Eugenium,Bernardi Epist, 238. de Eborcensi intruso, Epistola 238. Importu∣nut sum, & habeo excusationem Eugenii Apostolatus excusat me. Aiunt non vos esse Papam, sed me, & undique ad me confluunt qui habent negotia. Nec desunt in tanta multitudine amicorum, quibus officium negare non possum, non solum absque scandalo, sed etiam aebsque peccato; Et nunc est etiam alia excusatio non minus idonea, quia causa honestissima est, contra Idolum illud Eboracensi iterato stylus dirigitur, ea scilicet necessitate, quod saepenumero hoc telo impetitum à nobis necdum confossum est. Cur hoc? Quia nil fortè à nobis tale directum est, qualis fuit Gladius Jonathae qui nunquam rediit retrorsum; Nec sanè fuit culpa jaculi, sed dirigentis jaculum, Patet enim quod non in ea qua oportuit fortitudine missum est; Nec mirum, Quis enim in manu forti sagittas mittere potest; nisi filius excussorum? Qui locum Petri tenet, potest uno ictu extinguere Ananiam, uno Simonem Magum, & ut planius quod loquimur fiat, pe∣remptoriam dare sententiam ad depositionem Episcoporum solius Romani Pontificis non scitur esse, pro eo nimirum quod & si alii multi vocati sunt in partem sollicitudinis, solus ipse plenitudinem habeat potestatis. Solus perinde si dicere audeam in culpa est, si culpa non feritur, qua ferienda est, et eo impetu quo fuerit ferienda. Quo autem impetu non dico ferienda sed fulminanda fuerit, praedicti Eboracensis culpa, vestrae conscientiae derelinquo. Caeterum quod factum non est vobis credimus reservatum, ut in eo experiatur Ecclesia Dei, cui ipso auctore praestis, fervorem Zeli vestri, potentiam brachii vestri, & animi sapientiam, & timeat omnis populus Sacerdotem Domini, audiens sapientiam Dei esse in illo ad faciendum judicium. Ad eundem pro eodem. Epistola 239. Quam cupio semper illa de vobis au∣dire, in quibus glorificetur Deus, honoretur Ministerium (vestrum, & anima mea letificetur. Inde est quod audita responsione vestra, de quibusdam qui ad offi∣cium
legationis nimium videbantur, & ambitioè spirare, & impudenter sperare, supra quam dicere possumus facti  laetantes, Non autem nos tantum, sed & omnes qui di∣ligunt nomen vestrum, gavisi sunt gaudio magno. Porro visis literis vestris quas pro causa Rutinensis Ecclesiae denastis; tunc prorsus, tunc repletum est gaudio os nostrum, & lingua nostra exultatione, &c. Age ergo transeat am Sanctus hic pietatis zelus, & ad miseram illam Ecclesiam transmarinam quia tempus mierendi ejus Vina Domin: Sabbaoth est, vinea electa, vinea speciosissime, sed heu in desertum pene re∣dacta, quod singularis ferus depascitur eam; Cur dicunt inter gen∣tes, Vbi est Deus ejus? Vbi quem posuerunt custodem in vineis? Vbi manus putans? Vbi sarculus excolentis? Quousque sarmen∣to inutili occupatur tellus, suffocatur fructus? Et certe tempus pu∣tationis advenit. Siquidem homo pacis ejus in quo speravit, quod se purgare deberet, non purgatione ed amputatione opus esse testatur. Extant denique literae ipsius de eo ad Apostolicae sedis legatum, in quibus manifestè manifestam asserit intrusiorem, electionem negat. Ita ergo quem sibi paraverat defensorem, accusatorem sustinet. Ad haec quae ubique de co publica fama concelebrat, etiam virum militarem possent omni jure spoliare Cingulo Militar. Quamodo am poterit stare ubi multiplex vobis sub est ratio decien∣di, & voluntas non deest? Legi siquidem Zelum vestrum pro Ecclesia illa in Literis vestris & jam exigo de manibus vestris. Quanam via procedendum sit ad ejus dejectionem (ne∣que enim una  esse videtur) non est meum dictare sapienti. Nec multum nostra interest in qua parte arbor i fructuosa cadat, dummodo cadat. Dico tamen, qui sibi possessionem vendicat furtivarum commertio literarum, Nonne fur est & latro? Denique ubi as∣serit habuisse se clandestinas literas execrationis suae, aut verum est aut falsum quod loquitur; Si verum, reus est furti, et Summi Pontificis criminator. Si falsum, debet audire, occidisti et posse∣disti. Sap. 1. Os enim quod mentitur occidit animom. Sed absit ut tanta de tali viro credatur duplicitas, quanta ab ipso ei imponitur. Nempe Innocentius hic erat, cui si pro se re∣spondere liceret, proculdubio diceret huic, quia ego palam in te dedi sententiam, & in occulto locutus sum nihil. At last, to satisfie St. Bernards importunity,Thoms Stubbs, Acta Pontificum horacensium, col. 1721, 1722 Godwins Cata∣logue of Bishops Eugenius re∣moved William by his Papal power, and presently consecrated Henry Murdac Archbishop, sending him into England with his Pall, to the great offence of our King Stephen, who was much grieved with the disgrace of William (being his Cosen) which all men judged undeserved. The King thereupon denyed to admit him, unlesse he would swear fealty to him in an extraordinary manner; which he refusing, the King detained his Temporalities, and the Citizens of Yorke shut their gates against him, for which resistance he interdicted the City; whereupon divers seditions and tumults were raised for the space of 3. years, till his submission and reconciliation to the King. Upon the death of Pope Eugenius and St. Bernard, (Williams heavy ad∣versaries) he repairing to Rome complained to Pope Anastatius his successor, of his unjust deprivation by Eugenius; upon tyding of the death of Murdac, the Pope sensible of his former Injuries sustained, without any great suit, restored him unto all his honours of which he was unjustly deprived; soon after he returned with his Pall to his Archbishoprick, notwithstanding a new Appeal of the Dean and Archdeacon of Yorke to hinder his installment. Of which more in its due place; being here inserted only to evidence the grosse Injustice, Corruption, Bribery of Pope Innocent, Caelestine, Eugenius, and the Court of Rome in cases of Appeals, by St. Bernards testimony, and Pope Anastatius his resolution, particularly in this case of William Archbishop of York, relating to England; I now return to my Chronological method.Otto Frisin∣gensis l. 7. c. 3 Naucerus, Martinus Polo∣nus, Platina, Onuphrius,  Volte∣tanus, Fasci∣culus Tempo∣rue Barnes, Balaeus, Crantzius Sabellicus, Opmerus, Cent.

Pontificemque sacris decimis et largitionibus dignitatem tueri suam jusserunt, Ea dignitas delata trimum est ad Jordanem Petri Leonis filium, hominem in urbe vetere no∣bilitate ac populari gratia potentissimum. Quas actiones Lucius primum blanditiis im∣pedire contendit, deinde inanes eas expertus vim adhibendam putavit. Itaque postero ine∣unte Anno (1145.) Lucius à Romanis propter hoc vehementer exagitatus, supplex per Legatos Conradum Imperatorem in Italiam vocabat, sed Conradus aliunde impeditus, illuc venire non poterat, nec ejus tunc inservire tyrannidi. Lucius ergo ex alia via rem comparandam ratus, expctabat donec semel essent Senatores omnes cum Patricio in Capi∣tolio congregati ut de rebus suis consultarent, tunc exercitu co parato Senatores in Capi∣tolio obsedit (Papaliter factum) ordinem illum, qui libertatis Romanae erat funda∣mentum cupiens vel omnino perere, vel saltem expellere. Quo apparatu cognito Jor∣danes Patricius cum majori manu occurrit, populusque ad arma cucurrit, commissoque praelio ipsum Pontificem cum suis à Capitolio repulit. Lucius militio imixtus lapidi∣bus & axis ità est quassatus (so little did the people esteem his Papacy or Sanctity) ut neque amplius usque ad diem obitus sui, qui proximè consecutus est, in olio Pontificio consedisset, primo nondum sinito sui Pontisicatus anno.Ann. 1142 p, 180.

Bernardi quoque crbrescentem famam, mul∣tum suam facere putabant; atque si ejus dicipulum eligrint, praeceptoris authori∣tatem, auxilium & consilum nunquam defuturum suis desideriis sperabant. Nec eos feseliit spes subdola; auxit enim Bernardus quantum potuit Romani Pontifics authori∣tatem. As soon as St. Bernard heard of this elect on, being a plain-hearted man, he writ this chiding Epistle to the Cardinals and Bishops for making such an unfitting choyce. Epist. 236. ad Omnem Curiam Romanam quando eligerunt Abbatem Sancti Anastasii in Papam Eugenium. Dominis & Patribus venerandis, Cardina∣libus & Episcopis omnibus qui sunt de Curia, puer Sanctit itis eorum. Parcat vobis Deus; quid fecistis? Sepultum hominem revocastis ad homines; fugitantem curas et turbas, cur denuo implicuistis, et immiscuistis turbis? fecistis novissimum primum, et ecce novissima illius periculosiora priori∣bus: Crucifixus mundo, per vos revirit mundo; & qui elegerat ab∣jectus esse in domo Dei sui, ipsum vos in Dominum omnium elegistis. Cur consilium inopis corfudistis? Cur pauperis hominis & mendici & compuncti corde judi∣cium perturbastis? Currebat bene: Quid vobis visum est sepire vias ejus, avertere semitas, gressus involvere? Quasi descenderet de Hierusalem, et non magis ascenderet de Hiericho, sic incidit in latrones: et qui se (tanquam violentis quibusdam) Diaboli manibus, carnis il∣lecebris, et gloriae seculi potenter excusserat, non tamen valuit effuge∣re manus vestras. Num idcirco Pisam deseruit ut reciperet Romam? Num qui in una Ecclesia non sustinuit Vicedominatum, dominatum in omni Ecclesia requirebat? Quid igitur rationis vel consilii habuit de∣functo summo Pontifice, repente irruere in hominem rusticanum, latenti injicere manus, et excussa e manibus securi et ascia, vel ligone, in Palatium trabere, levare in Cathedram, induere pur∣pura
et bysso; accingere gladio ad faciendam vindictam in nationibus, incre∣pationes in populis;Psal. 149 ad alligandos Reges eorum in compedibus, & Nobiles eorum in manicis ferreis? Sic non erat inter vos sapiens et exercitatus cui potius ista convenirent? Ridiculum profecto videtur, pannosum homuncionem, assumi ad praesidendum Principibus, ad imperan∣dum Episcopis, ad regna et imperia disponenda. Ridiculum an miraculum? Planè unum horum. Non nego, non diffido posse fuisse hoc etiam opus Dei,Psal. 118 qui facit niabilia magna solus; praesertim cum audiam usquequaque ex ore multorum, quoniam à Domino factum est istud. Sed nec ego oblitus sum judicio∣rum Dei antiquorum, & Scripturae plurimos recensentis, ex privata seu etiam rusti∣cana vita olim assumptos in voluntatem Domini ad regendum populum ejus. Denique, nonne (ut unum è pluribus memorem) taliquodammodo elegit David servum suum, & suscepit eum de gregibus ovium, de post fetantes accepit eum? Ita inquam, ita & de nostro Eugemo in beneplacito Domini potuit contigisse: Non sum securus tamen, quo∣niam filius delicatus est, & tenera verecundia ejus assueta potius ocio & quieti, quàm tractandis quae foris sunt; tremendumque ne non ea auctoritate qua opor∣tuerit, sui Apostolatus officia exequatur. Quid putatis gerere animi nunc hominem illum, qui de secreto internae contemplationis, & amica sollicitudine cor∣dis, tanquam infans è gremio & sinu matris subitò perturbatus, tractum se ad medium videt, & quasi ovem ad victimam ductum ad tam insueta et insuavia? Nisi Dominus supponat manum suam, heu necesse est obruatur, et opprimatur onere insueto et nimio; quod et gygantinis (ut ai∣unt) vel ipsis quoque angelicis humeris formidabile videatur. Veruntamen quia sic factum est, & sicut multi dicunt, à Domino sactum est; vestra interest carissimi vestris ferventibus studiis fidelibusque obsequiis solicitè confoveri, quod vestris manibus constat elaboratum. Si qua ergò consolatio in vobis, si qua virtus cha∣ritatis in Domino, si qua miseratio pietatis, si qua compassionis viscera, assistite & col∣laborate illi in opere in quo assumptus est per vos à Domino. Quaecunque sunt vera, quaecunque pudica,Phil. 4. 8. quaecunque justa, quaecunque sancta, quaecunque amabilia, quaecunque bonae famae, haec ei suggerite, haec suadete, haec agite; & Deus pacis erit vobiscum. He likewise writ another elegant Epistle to Pope Eugenius himself;Epistola 237. Amantissimo Patri & Domino Dei gratiâ Summo Pontifici Eugenio, &c. Quia tamen semel coepi lequor ad Dominum meum: jàm enim filium dicere non audeo, quia filius in patrem, pater mutatus est in filium: Qui post me venit, ante me factus est; sed non invidio, quia quod mihi deerat in eo me habere confido, qui non solum post me, sed etiam per me venit. Nam si dignaris quodammodo per Evangelium ego te genui.1 Cor. 4. 14. Quae est ergo spes no∣stra, Psal. 76. & gaudium nostrum, & corona gloriae? Nonne vos ante Deum? Denique, fi∣lius sapiens gloria est patris.Gen. 17. Amodo tamen non vocaberis filius,Mar. 3. sed vocabitur tibi no∣men novum,Acts 13. quod os Domini nominavit. Haec est mutatio dexterae excelsi, & multi in mutatione ista gaudebunt. Nam quemadmodum olim Abram in Abraham, Jacob in Israel, & ut de tuis magis praedecessoribus tibi proponam: sicut Simon in Caepham, Saulus in Paulum: sic filius meus Bernardus in patrem meum Eugenium, laeta pror∣sus, & utili,1 Reg. 2. ut speramus, translatione promotus est. Digitus Dei est iste, suscitans de pulvere Egenum,Psal. 110. & de stercore erigens pauperem, ut sedeat cum Principibus, & solium gloriae teneat.2 Cor. 2. Superest ut facta hac mutatione tui, ipsa quoque quae tibi com∣missa est Domini tui sponsa mutetur in melius, & jam nequaquam Sarai sed Sara de caeterò nominetur. Intellige quae dico. Dabit enim tibi Dominus intellectum. Si ami∣cus Sponsies, ne dixeris, dilectam ejus Principem meam, sed Principem, nil tuum in ea vendicans,Mat. 20. nisi quod pro ea si oportuerit etiam ani∣mam dare debes.Joan. 10. Si Christus te misit, aestimabis te non ministrari, sed ministrare venisse, & ministrare non solum substantiam, sed ipsam quoque animam,2 Cor. 1. 24. sicut praefatus sum. Verus Successor Pauli dicet cum Paulo; Non quia dominamur fidei vestrae, sed adjutores sumus gaudii vestri; Petri haeres, au∣diet Petrum dicentem,1 Pet. 5. 3. Neque ut dominantes in Clerum, sed forma facti gregis; sic enim jam non ancilla, sed libera etiam & formosa speciosissimi sponsi per te in deside∣ratos asciscetur amplexus. Alioquin per quem alium haec tam debita libertas sperabitur,
si & tu (quod absit) in Christi haereditate quaeras quae tua sunt, qui jam & ante edice∣ras non dico tua non retinere, sed nec tuus esse? Ergo fiduciam talem habens in te, qualem in nullo praedecessorum tuorum, a multis retro tempo∣ribus visa est habuisse, exultat merito ubique & gloriatur in Domino Omnis Ecclesia Sanctorum, & specialiter illa cujus uternus te portavit, & cujus ubera tu suxisti. Quid ergo, Nonne & mihi licet gaudere cum gaudentibus? Nunquid non ero unus de numero laetantium?Psal. 2. Exaltavi fateor, sed cum tremore. Exultavi, sed in ipsa exultationis meae articulo, tunor et tremor venerunt super me. Ego enim et si nomen patris deposui, sed non timorem, sed non axietatem, postremò nec affeclum, nec viscera patris. Considero gradum, et casum vereor: Considero fastigium dig∣nitatis, et intueor faciem abyssi jacentis deorsum. Attendo cel∣situdinem honoris, et e vicino periculum reformido, pro eo quod scriptum est;Psal. 48. Homo cum in honore esset non intellexit. Quod quidem ad causam magis quàm ad tempus arbitror esse referendum, ut sic intelligatur dictum, Cum in ho∣nore esset non intellexit; ac si diceretur, honor aborbuit intellectum: Et quidem elegeras abjectus esse in domo Dei tui, & recumbere in novissimo loco in convivio ejus; sed placuit dicere ei qui te invitavit,Lu. 14. Amice ascende superius. Itaque ascendisti in altum, Noli altum sapere, sed time, ne fortè contingat serò miserabilem illam e∣mittere vocem,Rom. 11. A facie irae & indignationis tuae, elevans allisiii me. Altiorem quippe locum sortitus es, sed non tutiorem; sublimiorem, non se∣curiorem; Psal. 101. Teribilis prorsus,Exod. 3. terribilis est locus istae. Locus, in∣quam, in quo stas, terra sancta est; locus Petri est, locus Principis Aposto∣lorum, ubi steterunt pedes ejus. Locus illius est quem constituit Dominu Dominum do∣mus suae, & principem omnis possessionis suae. Si forte declinaveris a via Domini, sepultus est in eodem loco, ut sit ibi contra te in testimonium. Meritò tali Pastori, tali nutritio commissa est Ecclesia cum adhuc tenera, adhuc in cunabilis esset, cujus docta magisterio, & exemplo educata omnia terrena calca∣ret, utpote qui excusserat manus suas ob omni munere, qui di∣cebat de corde puro et conscientia bona,Acts 3. 6. Argentum & autum non est mihi. Haec hactenus. Caeterum causa quare ante tempus scripserim vobis, haec est. Wintoninesis Episcopus, & Eboracensis Archiepiscopus non gradiuntur uno Spiritu cum Cantuariensi Archiepiscopo, sed incedunt sibi ex adverso, & haec vetus est de le∣gatione quarela. Veruntamen quis est ille, & qui sunt illi? Nonne Eboracensis ipse est cui te praesente cum adhuc esses quasi unus ex nobis fratres tui restiterunt in faciem, eo quod reprehensibilis erat?Gal. 2. Sed speravit in multitudine divitiarum suarum, & praeva∣luit in vanitate sua. Certum est tamen, quod non intravit per ostium in ovile ovium, sed ascendit aliunde:Joan. 10. si Pastor fuisset, diligendus erat; si mercenarius, tolerandus; Nunc autem cavendus & repellendus utpote fur & latro. Quid dicam de Domino Win∣toniensi? Opera quae ipse facit testimonium perhibent de eo. Porrò Archiepiscopus Can∣tuariensis cui adversantur vir religiosus est, & suaveoentis opinionis. Pro ipso petimus ut respondeat ei Justitia sua.Ezech. 18. Verum illorum iniquitas super eos, ut sit sicut scriptum est, Justitia justi super eum erit, & impietas impii erit super eum. Cum acceperis tempus secundum opera manuum illorum retribues illis, ut sciant Prophetam esse in Israel. Quis mihi det antequàm moriar videre Ecclesiam Dei sicut in diebus antiquis, quando Apostoli laxabant retia in capturam; non in capturam argenti vel auri, sed in capturam animarum? Quam cupio illius te haeredi∣tare vocem,Acts 8. cujus adeptus es sedem, Pecunia, inquit, tua, tecum sit in perditionem. O vox tonitrui! O vox magnificentiae et virtutis! ad cujus terrorem confundantur et convertantur retrorsum omnes qui oderunt Syon. Hoc vehementer expectat, et omnino expetit a te mater tua; hoc filii matris tuae pusilli cum majoribus deside∣rant, hoc suspirant, ut omnis plantatio quam non plantavit Pater coelestius tuis manibus eradicetur. Ad hoc enim constitutus es super gen∣tes & regna,Jer. 1. 10. ut evellas, & destruas, & aedifices, & plantas. Multi audito hoc ver∣bo, dixerunt apud se, Jam securis ad radicem arborum posita est; Multi dicunt in corde suo,Mat. 3. 10. Flores apparuerunt in terra nostra, tempus amputationis advenit, in quo sarmenta sterilia recidentur, ut ea quae praevalent uberius fructum
afferant. Confortare igitur & esto robustus, manus tuae in cervicilus inimicorum tuoum. Vindica tibi ami constantia, & vigore spiritus partem quam dedit extra fratres tuos tibi omni eus Pater, quam & tulit de manu Amorei in gladio & arcu suo. In omnibus tamen operibus tuis memento te esse hominem, et ti∣mor ejus qui aufert Spiritum principum semper sit ante oculos tu∣os, Three of them dying within the space of one year. Quantorum in brevi Romanorum Pontificum mortes tuis oculis asperisti? Ipsi te praedecessores tui, tuae certissimae et ci∣tissimae decessionis admoncant, et modicum tempus dominatio∣nis rum paucitatem dierum tuorum nunciet tibi. Iugi proinde meditione inter transcuntis gloriae blandimenta, memorare no∣vilma tua, quia quibus successisti in sedem ipsos sine dubio se∣queris ad mortem. This Epistle of St. Bernard was seconded with sundry others, but especially with 5. sever elegant Bookes De Consideratione, dedicated to Pope Eugenius, wherein he earnestly pressed him to the serious consideration and discharge of his Pastoral duty, which was not a Domination or Dignity, but a worke and Ministry, wherein he should udy to profit, not to preside over others; discovering unto him the manifold abuses, corruptions of the Popes, Court of Rome, their Officers and pro∣ceedings under former Popes, which he exhorted him diligently to reform. Anno 1145, 1146, and 1147. upon sad tydings from the Holy I and, that the Saracens on the night of Christs Nativity, by the treachery of some Christians, had entred the Temple of Hierusalem, slan the Archbishop and Clergy ministring in the Temple, subdued all Mesopotamia, and endangered the losse of all the Holy and and Kingdome of Jerusalem; Pope Eugenius by his Bulls, and Saint Bernard by his Epistles and Sermons, excited the Emperor and most Christian Kings and Kingdoms to take up the Crosse and arms against them, granting him the same large indulgences for this service, as Pope Ʋrban had done before them; Omnibus inde rebus, quae a causam orientalem pertinebant, satis, ut tum potuit, constitu∣tis; the Romans mutining against the Pope to recover their antient Liberties, he thereupon being greatly incensed, resolved to be avenged of them; atque armis (a Popelike argument) ad pristinum Ecclesiae studium obsequiumque reducere statuit. Itaque Lucii exemplo, hand molli rem agendem brachioratus, Tiburtes, caeterosque Latii populus, quorum caussa adeum furorem Romani venerant, ad arma sollicitavit, at{que} ipso; corum ope Romanos invasit. Romani cum per aliquot dies acerrimè restitissent, tandem tectorum eversionem, patriae fortunarumque amissionem extimescentes, pacem pe∣tierunt, eaque demum his conditionibus impetrarunt, ut Patricium abrogarent, Praefectum restituerent, Senatores ex Pontificia authoritate tencrent, et Arnoldum turbarum concitatorem urbe ejicerent. Hisrebus transactis Eugeni∣us in Ʋrbem revertit, populo, Cleroque faullis vocibus, Benedictum esse, qui veniret in nomine Domini,Sigonius l. 11. See Abbas Us∣pergensis, & Cent. Magd. 12 c. 9. col. 1174, 1175. concinente. After which, Anno 1246. Romani seditionem redin∣tegrantes, rursus ab Engenio ut Tibur everteret, postularunt. Quare disertè negata, usque adeo exasperati animis sunt, ut se ni quod peterent i petrarent, vim adhibituros otenderent. Itaque Eugenius consilio cum Cardinalibus habito rursus Urbe cum eis ce∣dere statuit, ac pedum pulvere ad terrorem injiciendum in eos excusso trans Tyberim, una cum Cardinalibus, populo ipso telis missilibusque eos hostiliter inces∣sente, atque inde Tybur contendit. Hac re audita Bernardus ad populum Romae literas oburgationis plenas has scripsit. Nobilibus & Optimatibus,Bernardi E∣pist. 242 f. 224 Ad Romanos quande discesse∣unt à Domino Papa Eugenio. atque Ʋniverso populo Romano frater B. Clarevallis vo∣catus Abbas, Declinare à malo, & facere quod bonum est. Sermo mihi est ad te po∣pule sublimis & illustris cum sim vilis exiguaque persona, ac nullius pene momenti ho∣muntio. Id quidem verecundum atque onerosum mihi consideranti, quis quibus scribam, simulqu quam aliter hoc alius indicare possit, sed levius reor verecundia apud homines periclitari, quàm condemnari apud Deum silentio, veri taciturnitate & absconsione justitiae, &c. Communis est causa, & non est distinctio pusilli & magni. Dolor nempe in capite est, ac per hoc minime alienus, ne à minimis quidem vel extremis quibusque corporis partibus, nec a me. Pervenit profecto usque ad me, quamvis omnium minimum dolor maximus istesqui maximus est) & quod cum sit capitis non potest non esse & corporis, cujus membrum sum ego: Nunquid non dolente capite clamat lingua pro omnibus corporis
membris, in capite se dolere; omnia per ipsam suum caput suumque capitis fatetur in∣commodum. Dimittite proinde, quaeso dimittite, ut plangam paululum apud vos dolo∣rem meum, nec meum tantum, sed & totius Ecclesiae. Nonne ipsius vox est hodie per universum mundum, Caput meum doleo, caput meum doleo? Quis namque vel novissimus Christianorum in toto sit orbe qui non glorietur hoc capite, quod ambo illi glo∣riosi principes terrae alter amisso, alter submisso in cruce capite, suo tiumpho extulerunt, suo sanguine ornaverunt? Ad omnem itaque spectat Christianum injuria Apostolorum, & sicut in omnem terram exivit sonus eorum, sic laesio eorundem ab omnibus usquequa∣que sentitur, usquequaque plangitur, & doletur. Quid vobis visum est, O Romani, offendere Principes Mundi:Psal. 1. vestros autem speciales patronos? Cur Regem terrae, cur Dominum coeli, furor tam intollerabili, quam irrationabili in vos pariter provoca∣tis, dum Sacram & Apostolicam sedem divinis regalibusque privilegis singulariter sublimatum, auu sacrilego incessere, suoque minuere honore contenditis, quam vel soli contra omnes si oportuisset defendere debuistis? Sic fatui Romani non judicantes, ne∣que quod honestum est di cernentes, caput vestrum atque omnium, quod in vobis est, detur∣atis, pro quo magis nec vesiris ipsis cervicibus parcendum a vobis foret, si necessitao exegisset. Patres vestri urbi orbem subjugaverunt, vos urbem pro∣peratis orbi facere fabulam. En Petri haeres, Petri sede, et ur∣be a vobis expulsus est: en rebus et domibus suis vestris manibus spoliati sunt Cardinales atque Episcopi Ministri Domini. O popule stulte et insipiens! O Columba seducta non habens cor! Nonne ille Caput,Osee 7. et illi oculi tui erant? Quid ergo nunc Roma nisi sine Capite truncum corpus, sine oculis frons effossa, facies tenebrosa? Aperi Gens misera, aperi oculos tuos, & vide desolationem tuam iam∣amque imminentem. Quomodo in brevi mutatus est color optimus, facta est quasi vidua domina Gentium, Princeps Provinciarum: Verum initia malorum sunt haec graviora timemus. Nunquid non propè interritum es si persistis; Revertere, Revertere Sunamitis, revertere ad cor tuum; agnosce jam vel serò quae quanta, à quibus patiaris vel passa sis. Recordare qua causa, quo fine, per quos & in quos usus, non longe ante hos dies cunctrum quae in te sunt Ecclesiarum, omnis ornatus et census profligatus est, quicquid in Altaribus et in Altarium vasis, quicquid in ipsis sacris imaginibus Auri et Argenti reperiri nunc potuit, manibus impio∣rum direprum et asportatum est. Quid ex his omnibus tu in tuis nunc mar∣supiis invenis? Porro decor domus Domini irrcuperabiliter periit, & nunc quid tibi vi∣sum est iterare malitiam, innovare denuo super te dies malos? Quid modo vel lucri am∣plioris vel certioris spei arridet tibi? nisi quod in eo novissima tua cernuntur incautio∣ra prioribus, quod tunc quidem non solum multi de plbe, sed etiam de Clero & Principibus nonulli per orbem in Schismate illo faverunt tibi. Nunc vero sicut manus tuae contra om∣nis, sic manus omnium contra te. Mundus est à sanguine tue mundus omnis praeter te so∣lm, & filios tuot qui in te sunt. Vae ergo nunc tibi popule miserandè, & vae duplo quam ante, non ab exteris nationibus, non feritate Barbarorum, non a millibus armato∣rum. Vae tantum à facie tuorum, tibi vae à domesticis & amicis, à clade intestina, à cru∣ciatu praecordiorum, à tortionibus viscerum. Agnoscis ne jam, quod  omnes pacifici qui domestici, nec omnes amici qui videntur? Et si alias noveramus, sed nunc parte manifestius edocemur omnem veritatem illius sermonis Domini quam dixit, quoniam inimici hominis domestici ejus.Mich. 7. Vae fratri à fratre in medio tui, & filiis à parentibus. Vae non à gladiis sed à labiis iniquis,Mat. 10. 36, 37. & à lingua dolosa. Usquequo male in malo vos al∣terutrum confortatis, & Gladiis labiorum invicem sternitis, invicem perditis, ut ab in∣vice consumamini. Congregamini oves dispersae, redite ad pascua, redite ad Pa∣storem et Episcopum animarum vestrarum. Redite pravaricatores ad cor; quod loquor non quasi hostis convicians, sed quasi amicut objurgans. Habet vera amicitia nor nunquam objurgationem, adulationem nunquam, sed iungimus & obsecrationem. Obsecramus pro Christo reconciliamini Deo,2 Cor. 5. 1. reconciliamini Principibus ve∣stris (Petrum loquor & Paulum) quos utique in Vicario et Successore suo Eugenio suis sedibus et aedibus effugastis; Reconciliamini in∣quam orbis Principibus, ne forte incipiat pro eis pugnare orbis terrae contra insensatos. An nescitis quia his offensis nihil om∣nino valetis; his propitiis, nihil omnino timetis. Non, inquam, non
timebis sub horum tutela millia populi circumdantis te, Urbs inclyta, Civitas fortium. Reconciliare proinde illis simul & millibus martyrum, qui quidem apud te, sed contra te sunt propter grande peccatum quod peccasti, inquo & persistis. Reconciliare etiam om∣ni Ecclesiae Sancterum qui ubique terrarum aeudito hoc verbo scandalizati sunt. Alio∣quin pagina ista contra te, in testimonium erit, sed & ipsi Apostoli & Martyres tui stabunt in magna constantia adversus eos qui se angusti verunt,Sap. 1. & qui abstulerunt labo∣res eorum, Sed jam finem loquendi omnes pariter audiamus. Annunciavi justitiam praenunciavi periculum, veritatem non tacui, hortatus sum ad meliora; superest ut aut de vestra citius correctione laetemur, aut de justa imminenti damnatione certi inconsola∣biliter lugeamus arescentes & tabescentes prae timore & expectatione quae supervenient u∣niversae Ʋrbi. The Romans notwithstanding this Letter persisting obstinately in their Oppositi∣sition against Eugenius,Sigonius, l. 11 p. 279. to cast off his Papal Usurpation over them; this Pope there∣upon, veterum Pontificum exemplo, in Franciam ire constitutit, ut absentia desiderium sui Romanis efficeret; accordingly he retired into France to avoid the fury and treachery of the Romans, and that principally by St. Bernards perswasion, who gave him this black Character of them.Bernardus de Consideratione lib. 4. f. 242, 243. Quid de populo loquar? Populus Ro∣manus est. Nec brevius potui, nec expressius tamen aperire de tuis Parochianis quod sentio. Quid tam notum seculis, quam protervia et fastus Romanorum? Gens insueta paci, tumultui assueta; Gens incivilis et intractabi∣lis usque, adhuc subdi nescia, nisi cum non valet resistere. En pla∣ga; tibi incumbit cura haec; dissimulare non licet; Rides me, forsitan fore incurabilem persuasus; Noli diffidere, curam exegeris, non curationem. Denique audisti, curam illius hab; & non cura vel sana illum. Verum dixit quidam, Non est in medico semper relevetur ut aeger, &c. Quem dabis mihi de tota maxi∣ma urbe, qui te in Papam receperit precio, seu spe precii non inter∣veniente? Et tunc potissimum volunt dominari, cum professi fue∣rint servitutem. Fideles se spondent, ut oportunius fidentibus noceant. Ex hoc non erit consilium tibi, à quo se arcendos putent, non secretum, quo se non ingerant, Si stante prae foribus, quoquam illorum moram vel modicam fecerit ostiarius; ego tunc pro illo esse nolo. Et nunc experire paeuci; noverim ne & ego vel aliquatenus mores gentis. Ante omnia sapientes sunt ut faciant mala, bonum ante facere nesciunt. Hi invisi terra & coelo, utrique iniecere manus, impii in Deum, temerarii in Sancta, seditiosi in invicem, aemuli in vicinos, inhumani in extraneos, quos neminem amantes amat ne∣mo; & cum timeri affectant ab omnibus, omnes timeant necesse est; Hi sunt qui sub∣esse non sustinent, praesse non norunt, superioribus infideles, in∣ferioribus importabiles. Hi inverecundi ad petendum, ad negandum frontosi. Hi importuni ut accipiant, inquieti donec accipiant, ingrati ubi acceperint. Docuerunt linguam suam grandia loqui cum operentur exigua. Largissimi promissores, & parcissimi exhibitores. Blandissimi adulatores, & mordacissimi detractores, simplicissimi dissi∣mulatores, & malignissimi proditores, Excurrimus usque huc, plenius te atque ex∣pressius ad monendum putantes horum quae circa te sunt in hac parte; jam ad ordi∣nem recurramus. St. Bernard perceiving the Romans to persist obstinately in their Rebellion against Eugenius, whom they forcibly expelled, without hopes of any amicable reception of him by Letters or mediation, endeavoured to stirr up the French King and other Princes to restore him, and reduce the Romans by force of arms to obedience both to the Pope and Emperor; to which end he writ this memorable Epistle to Conrade King of the Romans, evidencing the Emperors and Kings Supremacy in causes Ec∣clesiastical, that the defence, care of the Church and Religion, belongs primarily to them, not the Pope, and that Rome was the head, Inheritance of the Empire, though the See of the Papacy. Bernardi Epi∣stola, 243. f. 225. Ad Conradum Regem Romanorum. Nec dulcius, nec amicabilius, sed nec artius om∣nino Regnum Sacerdotium{que} conjungi, seu complantari in invicem poterunt, quam ut in persona Domini ambo haec pariter convenirent, utpote qui factus est nobis ex utraque tribu secundum carnem, Summus & Sacerdos & Rex; non solum autem, sed et commiscuit ea nihilominus, ac confederavit in sue corpore, quod est populus Christianus, ipse caput illius, ita ut hoc ge∣nus
hominum Apostolica voce,1 Pet. 2. genus electum, regale Sacerdotium appelletur. In a∣lia quoque scriptura,Apoc. 1. quotquot sunt praedestinati ad vitam, None omnes Reges & Sacerdotes nominantur? Ergo,Matth. 1 quae Deus conjunxit, Homo non separet: Magis autem quod divina sanxit authoritas, humana studeat adimplere voluntas, & jungant se animis, qui juncti sunt institutis. Invicem se foveant, invicem se defendant, invicem onera sua portent. Ait Sapiens,Eccles. 4. 9. 11 Frater aduvans fratrem, ambo consola∣buntur.Gal. . 25. Quod si alterutrum se (quod absit) corroserint & momorderint, nonne ambo desolabuntur? Non veniat anima mea in consilia eorum qui dicunt, vel Imperio pa∣cem et libertatem Ecclesiarum, vel Ecclesiis prosperitatem et ex∣altationem Imperii nocituram; Non enim utriusque institutor Deus in destructionem ea connexuit, sed in aedificationem. Si hoc sis, quousque vos communem contumeliam, communem dissimulatis injuriam? Nonne ut Apostolica sedes, ita et caput Imperii Roma est? Ut ergo de Ecclesia taceam, num honor Regi est truncum in manibus tenere Imperium? Et quidem ignoro quid vobis super hoc consulent Sapien∣tes vestri & Principes Regni; sed ego in insipientia mea loquens quod sentio, non tacebo. Ecclesia Dei ab exortu su, usque ad haec tempora pluris tribulata est, & pluries liberata est,Psal. 128. (to wit, by Christian Kings an Emperors) Denique, audite quid ipsa de se loquatur in Psalmo; Ipsius enim vox est; Saepe expugnaverunt me à juven∣tue mea, etenim non potuerunt mihi: supra dorsum meum fabricaverunt peccatores, pro∣lo gaverunt iniquitatem suam.Psal. 124. Certus esto, O Rex, quod nec nunc quque relin∣quet Dominus Virgam peccatorum super sortem justorum.Esa. 59. Non est abbreviata manus Domini, nec facta impotens ad salvandum.Acts 20. Liberabit & hoc tempore absque du∣blo sponsam suam qui suo sanguine redemit eam, suo spiritu dotavit, donis caele∣stibus exornavit, ditavit nichilominus & terrenis. Liberabit inquam, Liberabit; sed si in manus alterius, viderint Regni Principes, id ne honor Regis, regnive utilitas sit; non est utique. Quamobrem accin∣gere gladio tuo super femur tuum potentissime, et restituat sibi Caesar quae Caesaris sunt,Nota. et quae sunt Dei Deo, Vtrumque interesse Caesaris constat, et propriam tueri Coronam, et Eccle∣siam defensare; Alterum Regi, alterum convenit Ecclesiae advo∣cato. Victoria sicut in Domino conidimus prae manibus est; Superbia & arro∣gantia Romanorum plus quam fortitudo eorum. Quid enim? Nunquid quispiam magnus vel potens verbi gratia, Imperator aut Rex, faedam Rem istam in Imperium pariter Sacerdotiumque praesumit? Sed Populus hic maledictus, & tumultuosus; qui suas nescit metiri vires, cogitare sinem, considera∣re proventum, insipientia sua, furore suo ausus est hoc grande sacrilegium at∣tentare. Absit ut vel ad momentum stare possit ante faciem Re∣gis popularis manus, vulgi temeritas. Factus sum insipiens, qui cum sim vilis ignobilisque persona, tanquam aliquis magnus consiliis tantae magnitudinis, tantaeque Sapientiae me ingessi, & de re magna. At quo ignobilior, atque obje∣ctior, tanto liberior sum ad loquendum quod Charitas suggerit: Unde & adhuc, addo in eadem inspientia mea; Si quis aliud quam locutus sum vobis, quod non credimus, suadere conabitur is profecto, aut non dili∣git Regem, aut parum intelligit quid Regiam deceat Majesta∣tem, aut certe quae sua sunt quaerit, et non valde quae vel Dei vei Regis sunt curare convincitur. This Pope at last by St. Bernards solicitation and the assistance of Conrade, and Ludovicus King of France, was restored to the possession of his See at Rome. In the mean time whiles Engenius remained in France, the Emperor Conrade apprehended that St. Bernard had done something in derogation of the Empire and his Prerogative; whereupon he writ this short Epistle to him, to acquit himselfe from this accusation. Querimoniae Regis nostrae sunt,Ad Conadum Regem Roma∣norum, Epist. 183. & maximè illa quàm dignanter exprimitis de inva∣sione Imperii; Regis dedecus, Regni diminutionem nunquam vo∣lui; Volentes odit anima mea: Legi quippe, Omnis anima potestatibus subli∣mioribus subdita sit,Rom. 13. Et qui potestati resistit, Dei ordinationi resistit. Quam tamen
sententiam, cupio vos & omnimodis moneo custodire, in exhibenda reverentia Summae & Apostolicae Sedi, & beati Petri Vicario, sicut ipsam vobis vultis ab universo servari Imperio. Pope Eugenius intending to hold a General Council at Rhemes in France, the French King conceiving it might derogate something from his Prerogative and right of his Crown, intended to prohibit it: hereupon St. Bernard writ this E∣pistle to perswade him to permit this Council to sit; promising that the Pope should correct and reform any thing wherein he had exceeded his Jurisdiction, to his pre∣judice, wherein he would assist him. Ludovico Dei Gratiâ Excellentissimo Regi Francorum, B. Clarevallis vocatus Abbas,Bernardi Epist. 255. f. 225. Ad Ludovicum Regem Fran∣corum. fidelis suus salutem, à Rege Regum & Domino Dominantium, ipsi & dilectae ejus, & filiis ejus. Regna terrae, et jura Regnorum tunc satè sana suis Do∣minis atque illaesa persistunt, si divinis ordinationibus ac dispositionibus non resistunt. Cur Domine trascitur furor tus contra Dei electum, quem tua quoque sublimitas suscepit et praeelegit tibi quidem in Patrem, filio autem tuo in Samue∣lem? Armatur Regia indignatio non plane in extraneos, sed in se∣metipsam et suos. Non mirum si juxta Scripturam, Ira viri justitiam Dei non ;Jacob. 1. quae propriae quoque utilitatis, sed indignitatis, sed salutis facit sapè ut nec  omnibus advertas periculum, sentias damnum. Colligitur Consili∣um: Quid in hoc detrahitur Regiae Gloriae, Regni utilitatibus? Ibi Vniversae Ecclesiae commendabitur, ac rememorabitur Excel∣lentiae vestrae prompta et specialis devotio, quod Regum primus, aut certe inter primos rabie persequentium eandem matrem vestram strenuissime et Christianissime defendendo obviastis. Ibi gloriosè ab ingenti illa multitudine debitae gratiae referentur vobis; ibi a Milibus Sanctorum orabitur pro vobis et vestris. Alias autem quàm sit hoc eempore necessarius Conventus Episcoporum nullus ignorat, nisi qui durus corde, matris Ecclesiae angustias non attendit. At calor inquiunt nimius est; quasi nos glacilia cor∣pora habeamus; An corda nobis magis congelata sunt, & nemo est qui juxta Prophetam, Compatiatur super contritione Joseph.Amos 6. Sed haec alias. Nunc autem ego minimus in regno vestro sed dignitate, non fidelitate, dico vobis, non expeit velle impedire tan∣tum & tam necessarium bonum. Nec desunt evidentes causae quibus id manifestum fa∣cere possem, quas & nunc proferre in medium ad manum mihi est; nisi quod sat arbitror dictum Sapienti. Tamen si quid ex Apostolicae auctoritatis rigore pro∣cessit, unde se merito esse turbatam Celsitudinis vestrae Sereni∣tas arbitratur; qualiter hoc ipsum revocetur, aut temperetur, prout oportet ad honorem vestrum, fideles vestri qui adherent to∣tis viribus enitentur. Inter nos quoque, si quid possumus, non dissimulabimus. The design of this whole Epistle imports; 1. That the Pope himself could not then summon any Council in France, without the Kings special royal license, authority, and conviction of the grounds and necessity thereof. 2ly. That he had power to prohibit any Council to assemble in his Realm, if held by the Pope himself without his license and approbation. 3ly. That if the Pope did or had done any thing by his Decrees, or Papal authority, to the Kings offence, or prejudice of his honor, all his loyal Subjects and Clergy were obliged to endeavour to revoke and moderate it. Eugenius by S. Bernards instructions and assistance,Carolus Sigo∣nius Hist. de Regno Italiae, lib. 11. p. 277. beyond expectation of all men, became more couragious, Papal, & apt to govern the See of Rome then was imagined, whence Sigonius observes; Eugenius ubi primum est designatus, contra opinionem omnium ingentem animi indolem prae se tulit. Nam cum à Romanis ad remittenda urbis vectigalia urgeretur, eos ita aspernatus est, ut ne dignos quidem, queis cum habitaret, putarit. Itaque urbe statim egressus ad Monasterium Farfense se contulit, eoque Cardinalibus evocatis novo instituto, ibi consecrationem accepit, atque inde aspectum pervicacis populi devitans, arce S. Angeli Petri Leonibus tradita, Viterbi∣um se recepit. Sub eosdem dies Arnoldus Haereticus ex Germania in Italiam rever∣sus, captato Romanae seditionis & Pontificiae absentiae tempore, in Urbem se con∣jecit, ac seditioni per se satis ardenti majores quoque faces admovit, populum ad vetera majorum instituta, factaque imitanda gravi inprimis, ac praesentibus tem∣poribus
oportuna oratione adhorans, qui senum consilio, et juvenum manu to∣tum sibi terrarum orbem subjecissent, reaedificandum Capitolium ac Senatores, Equitesque Romanos renovandos, inclamans admini∣strationem urbis ad Pontificem non pertinere, ipsum Ecclesiastico jure contentum esse oportere. Quibus vocibus  Romani, praese∣ctura urbis omnino sublata, caeteros Magistratus Patricio  ac populari ∣multu concito turres aliquot Laorum, Clericorum, Nobilium deturbarunt, Vaticanam cperunt, ac peregrinos religionis causa  ex spolia∣runt, quique multam petitam per dere resarunt, eos in  trucida∣runt. Neque his contenti, liters  Legatos ad Conrdum Regem in Germaniam misere, eumque ad deendum dominatum in Vrbe Pontificium vo∣cavere, regemque Catholicum novo dissidio alienare ab Ecclesia contendre. Earum literarum hoc suit exemplum.  Regi, Senatus populusque Romanus salutem. Multis literis ceriores vos  quem∣admodum in authoritate, fideque vestra maneamus; ac pro vestra in  Coona augenda quotidè decretemus, ad quas quod nihil responders, satis mirari non possumus. Nos enim Regnum et Imperium Romanum redigere, cupientes in cum statum, qui fuit tempore Constantini et Justiniani, qui universum Orbem terrarum Senatus et populi Romani viribus pepererunt, Senatoribus restitutis, quique tantum honorem Impe∣rio eripuecant, conculcatis, id agamus, ut vos quae Imperio de∣bentur, obtineatis, nam Pacem & Justitum petentibus cunctis , & tur∣res ac domos potentium qui vestro imperio una cum Siculo, & Pontifice adversari moliebantur, occupavimus, & alias in vetra potestate tenemus, alias solo cquavi∣mus. Verum hoc nomine Pontifex, Fragitanes, & silii Petri Leonis, homines & a∣mici Siculi, excepto Jordano nostro vestri studiosissimo, Ptolemaeus quoque & alii plures nos oppugnant, ne vobis Imperialem Coronam, ut convenit impona∣inus. Quare oramus ne iniquis de Senatoribus, nobisque sermonibus credatis, ve∣strumque nobis auxilium denegetis, sed primo quoque tempore in Italiam venia∣tis, quia quicquid optabitis, nullo negotio assequemini, atque in Urbe terrarum Principi toti Italiae dominantes, commodius, quam majores vestri fecerunt, ut nos qui∣dem cupimus, habitabitis, Pontem Milvium, qui ad inter sependos Imperatorum ad urbem aditus erat eversus, ne Petri Leones vobis ex arce Sancti Angeli obesse venientibus possent ut statuerunt cum Pontifice & Siculo, , & brevi muro firmissimo ac Sicilibus munitum habebimus. Notum etiam vobis esse op∣tamus Pontificem, ut audivimus, Siculo concessisse virgam & , & Mitram & Sandalia, et ne quem in terram suam mittat Legatum nisi quem ipse poposcerit, et Siculum grandem adversus vos pecu∣niam tribuisse. Petimus à vobis ut in posterum Legatos nostros  accipia∣tis, & eis nomine nostro agentibus fidem habeatis, sunt enim magnie Authoritatis viri, Guido Senator, Jacobus filius Sixti Procuratoris, & Nicholaus eorum Socus. Haec Romani. Conradus autem indignitate & vanitate literarum cootus, ut Le∣gatos Romanorum palam respuit, sic contra Guidem Pinum Cardinalem, aliosque qui a Pontifice missi fuerunt, comitèr accepit, ac liberaliter eis omnia (quod peti∣erunt) privilegia confirmavit. By which passages  observable, that both the Pope and Romans then appealed to the Emperor Conrade, as their superiour Lord. How much the Popes,Bernardus de Consideratio∣ne ad Eugeni∣nium, l. 4. f. f. 242. Cardinals, and Court of Rome were degenerated from their pristine Usage of preaching and seeking the salvation of the peoples souls, through worldly Pomp, Pride, Ambition, St. Bernard thus complained to Eugenius himself, without hopes of reformation, Quia non placebit Satrapis, plus Majestati, quàm veritati faventibus.2 . 12.

Non quaerentes quae sua sunt, sed impendentes; impendere curam, impendere substantiam,Luke 1. impendere & seipsos. Unde unus illorum, Et ego (ait) superimpendar pro animabus vestris;2 Cor. 11. Et tanquam dicerent, non venimus ministrari sed ministrare, pone∣bant quotiens opportuisset sine sumptu evangelium. Ʋnus erat de Subditis quaestus, una pompa, unaque voluptas, si quomodo eos possent parare Domino plebem perfectam. In om∣nimodis satagebant, etiam in multa contritione cordis & corporis, in labore & ae∣rumna,
in fame & siti, in frigore & nuditate. Vbi nunc quaeso consuetudo haec? subiit dissimilis valde, longe in aliud mutata sunt studia, et utinam non in pejus. Cura tamen & anxietas, & aemulatio & sollicitudo fateor per∣severant. Translata haec, non imminuta. Testimonium vobis perhibeo, quod nec substantiae parcitis, non magis quàm antè. Diversa autem locatio dissimilitudinem facit. Mag∣na abusio, pauci ad os Legislatoris, ad manus omnes ressiciunt, &c. Quale est quod de spoliis Ecclesiarum emuntur, qui dicunt tibi Euge, euge? Pauperum vita in plateis divitum seminatur, Argentum micat in luto, accurritur undique, tollit illud non pauperior sed sortior, aut qui forte citius prcurrit. Ate tamen os iste, vel potius mors ista non cepit, in te utinam desinat. In his 3d. Booke, he hath this memorable discourse concerning the great a∣buse, grievance, vexation of Appeals to the Court of Rome, which he pressed Euge∣nius seriously to consider and redresse. Bernardus de Consideratione l. 3. f. 240, 241. Annon limina Apostolorum plus jam ambitio, quam devotio terit? An non vocibus ejus vestrum toto die resultat Palatium? Annon quaestibus ejus tota legum Canonumque disciplina insudat? An∣non spoliis ejus omnis Italica inhiat inexplebili aviditate rapacitas? Quid ita tua ipsius spiritualia studia non saltem intercidit, sed ab∣scidit, quotiens sancta & faecunda tua abortiri otia fecit inquietum, & inquietans ma∣lum? Aliud est quod ab oppressis appellatur ad te, aliud autem quod ambitio in Ecclesia per te regnare molitur. Nec de esse illis, nec huic aliquatenus assentire opus. Quàm vero iniquè fovetur illa, spernun∣tur illi, utrisque tamen debitor es; illis ut erigas, istis ut reprimas. Et quoniam incidit de Appellationibus, prosequi aliquatenus non erit ab re. Magno in his & pio opus intui∣tu est, ne quod magna fuit necessitate provisum, male utendo redda∣tur inutile. Michi videtur & in multam posse eas devenire perniciem, si non sum∣mo moderamine actitentur. Appellatur de toto mundo, ad te quidem in testimonium singularis primatus tui. At si tu sapis, non primatu gaudebis,Luc. 4. sed fructu. Apostolis dictum est, In hoc nolite gaudere quod Spiritus subjiciuntur vobis. Appellatur ad te, ut dixi, et utinam tam fuctuose, quam necessarie. Vtinam cum oppress us clamat, sen∣tiat oppressor, et non superbiat impius unde incenditur pauper. Quia e regione tàm perversum, tam recti alienum, ut laetatur qui malum fecit, et qui tulit inaniter fatigetur? Inhumanissimè non moveris erga hominem cui illatae injuriae cumulavêre dolorem, & labor itineris, & damna expensarum. Sed nichilo∣munus ignavissime in illum non moveris, qui huic tot calamitatum partim author, partim extitit causa. Evigilia homo Dei, cum haec con∣tingunt, moveatur miseratio, moveatur & indignatio tua; Alteram laeso, alteram lae∣denti debes. Consoletur ille damnorum resarcitu suorum, satisfactione injuriarum, fine calumniarum. Cum isto ita agatur ut poeniteat fecisse, quod non timuit facere, & non de poenis innocentis rideat. Arbitror idem debere pti illum qui sine causa fortè appel∣lavit. Formulam hanc justitia praefigit tibi, & divinae incommutabilis ratio aequitatis, & ni fallor ipsa Appellationum lex, ut illicite usurpata appellatio, nec pro∣sit appellanti, nec appellato obsit: ut quid enim frustra fatigatus sit homo? Quam plenum justitiae, ut sese potius aeserit qui voluit proxi∣mum? Appellasse inique iniquum est, inique et impune ini∣quarum Appellationum fomes. Iniqua autem omnis appellatio, ad quam Iustitiae inopia non coegit. Appellare non ut graves, sed si graveris licet. Appellandum a sententia: ante sententiam improve omnino, nisi ob manifestum gravamen praesumitur appellatio. Qui igitur non gravatus, appellat, liquet, quod aut gravare intendit, aut tempus redimere. Non est autem suffragium appellatio, sed refugiō. Quantos novimus appellasse pulsatos, quo interim liceret quod nunquā licet? Nonnullis etiam quod vixerunt licuisse appellationis suffragio nefaria scimus; Verbi gratia, incestum, adulterium. Quale est hoc
turpitudini patrocinari, quod vel maxime formidari a turpibus o∣portebat? Quousque murmur universae terrae aut dissimulas,Nota. aut non advertis? Quousque dormitas? quousque non evigilat consi∣deratio tua ad tantam appellationum confusionem, atque abusio∣nem? Praeter jus et fas, propter morem et ordinem fiunt. Non locus, non modus, non tempus, non causa discernitur, aut persona. Praesumuntur leviter passim, plerunque et nequiter. Voletes ma∣lignari nonne his potissimum terreri solebant? Nunc terrori ipsi er his magis fiunt atque id bonis. Antidotum versum in venenum: non mutatio dexterae excelsi haec. Appellantur boni a malis, ut non faciant bona; et su∣persedent a voce tonitrui tui formidantes. Denique, appellantur Episcopi, ne illicita audeant Matrimonia solvere, vel prohibere. Appellantur, ne rapinas, ne furta, ne sacrilegia et quae ejusmodi sunt punire ullatenus, vel cohibere praesumant. Appellantur, ne indignas et infames personas a sacris officiis beneficiisve repelle∣re, seu amovere queant. Quod tu invenis remedium morbo huic, ne quod repertum ad remedium fuit, reperiatur ad mortem? zela∣tus est Dominus domum orationis factam speluncam latronum; Tu ejus Minister dissimulas miserorum refugium; datum arma ini∣quitati. Videas praeripi passim partes oppressorum, et prorumpere ad appellandum, non tam gravatos, quam gravare volentes: Quid hoc mysterii? Tuum est considerare, non meum commentari istud. Et eur, inquis, male appellati non veniunt ostensuri suam innocenti∣am, malitiam convicturi? Dico quod dicere ad hoc solent. Nolumus vexari frustra; In curia esse qui proclivius faveant appellantibus, fovean appella∣tiones. Cessuris Romae domi cedere satius. Fateor me non omnino decredere his. Quem das mihi in tam crebris appellationibus quae hodie fiunt, qui pro expensis itineris, vel nummum restituerit illi quem forte ap∣pellarit? Mirum vero si ita omnes et appellantes justi, et appellati rei vestro examine inventi sunt.Sap. 1. Diligite, inquit, justitiam qui judicatis ter∣ram. Parum est justitiam tenere, nisi et diligas. Qui tenent, tenent, qui diligunt zelantur,Mich. 6. 8. Amator Justitiae inquirit , & prosiquitur eam. Porro omnem justitiam prosequitur. Nihil tibi et illis, qui appellationes venati∣ones putant. Pudet Elogii, quod apud Ethnicos jam vertitur in Parabolam, duos movimuscervo. servos pingues, ut mitius loquar, plus facetiae quam justitiae hic; Tu si amas justitiam, appellationes non affectas, sed sustines. Veruntamen quid emolumenti affert Ecclesiis Dei tua unius hominis justitia, ubi sententia praevalet aliter affectorum? At istud loci illius erit cum coeperint versari qui circa te sunt. Nunc verò non te exi∣stimes ociosè vacare considerationi huic, qua appellationes ad legitimum si fieri potest re∣voces usum. Et si hinc mea quaeratur vel potius curetur sententia, dico Appellationes ut non contemnendas, sic nec usurpandas omnino. Porrò horum quid insolentius censeam haud facile dixerim, nisi quod usurpatio quandam videtur in∣ducere contemptus necessitatem, ac per hoc fortè acrius insectanda quia amplius noceat: Aut non verè nocentior est mala in se, in partu pejor? Nonne ipsa est quae ipsum jus quoque naturae, aut extenuat at exterminat? Nam saepe rebus etiam preciocissimis, pre∣cii gratiam non modo demit, sed adimit. Quid Sacramentis acceptius? usurpata tamen ab indignis, indigneve tractata, minimè acceptantur. Magis habent damnationem, quia debitam venerationem non habent. Fateor, grande et generale mundo bonum esse appellationes; idque tam necessarium, quam solem ipsum mortalibus. Re∣vera quidam sol Justitiae est, procedens ac redarguens opera tenebrarum; prorsus, foven∣dae & manutenendae sunt; sed quas extorsit necessitas, non calliditas ad∣invenit: Vsurpatoriae sunt hujusmodi omnes, non subvenientes in necessitate, sed opitulantes iniquitati. Quid ni veniant in con∣temptum?
Quanti ut talibus quoque deferrent etiam de proprio cessere jure ne longo et casso itinere fatigarentur? Plures tamen sua amittere, non ferentes Appellationes minus oportunas, et celsa nomina importunius contemserunt. Dico aliquid quod ad rem per∣tinet, exempli causa▪ Quidam sibi publice desponsaverat uxorem, adest dies cele∣bris nuptiarum,  omnia, invitati multi, &  concupiscens uxorem proximi sui  appellationis inopinatae prorumpit affirmans, sibi traditam pri∣us, suam  esse debere. Stupet Sponsus,  omnes, sacerdos non audet pro∣gredi: omnes apparatus ille, descendit quisque in donum suam coenam manducaturus; Sponsa a mensa et thalamo sponsi suspenditur, quo∣usque Roma reditum est; Parisiis contigit hoc nobili Galliarum Civitate sede Regia. Rursum in Civitate eadem, quidam sibi desponsata Uxore diem, : Interim emergit calumnia, dicentibus quibus∣dam, non de bere conjungi. Ad judicium Ecclesiae causa delata est; sed non est ex∣pectaa sentence, appellatum est sine causa, sine gravamine, solo frustratoriae disationis  perdere quae pararat, sive dilectae camdiu frustrari consortio  quod proposuerat, contempta sive dissimulata Ap∣pellatione peregit. Quid illud quod in Antisiodorensi Ecclesia nuper a quodam adolescentulo praesumptuim est? Nempe defuncto Sancto Episcopo volentibus Cle∣ricis alium, ut  est eligere sibi, intervenit ille appellens, et vetans ne sieret quous{que} isset et redisset ab urbe: Cui tamen Appellationi nec ipse detulit. Num cum videret se contemni tanquam qui irrationabiliter appellasset, accitis qus  die post factam ab aliis electionem, fecit suam. Cum itaque ex his & innumeris talibus liqueat,Nota. non ex contemptu gigni usurpationem, sed ex usurpatione contemptum, videris tu quid sibi velit quod Zelus vester assidè perè vindicat illum, istam dissimulat. Vis perfeciicus corcere contemptum? Cu∣ra in ipso utero pessimae matris praefocari Germen nequam, quod ita siet si usurpatio digna animadversione mulctetur. Tolle u∣surpationem et contemptus excusationem non habet. Porrò inex∣cusabilitas ausunm explodet. Non sit proinde Vsurpator, et contemptor nullus erit, aut admodum rarus. Bene facis tu, quod appella∣tionum negato suffragio, imo suffugio, multa remittis negotia ad cognoscentes, vel qui noscere citius possunt. Ubi enim certior ac fa∣cilior notio, ibi decisio tutior expeditiorque esse potest. Quam plenum Gratiae, quam mul∣torum quoque per hoc & laboribus parcis & sumptibus? At quibus sic credas id tibi omnimodis attendendum. Poteram multa de eodem utiliter addere his, sed memor praepositi mei contentus interim occasionem dedisse. After this he thus censures the Avarice and Bribery of the Pope and Court of Rome,  Et primum quod occurrit minimè transeundum reor; Praees, et singulariter:De  l. 3. p. 241. Ad quid? Eget tibi dico consideratione, Nunquid ut de Subdi∣tis crescas? Nequaquam; sed ut ipsi de te, Principem te consti∣tuerunt, sed sibi, non tibi; Alioquin quo pacto te reputas superio∣rem his a quibus beneficium mendicas? Audi Dominum; Qui potesta∣tem habent super eos,. 22. benefici vocantur; At istud de his qui foris sunt; Quid ad nos? Tu id mendaciter diceris, si non tam beneficus esse, quam beneficis praeesse intendas. Parvi dejectique animi est, de Subditis non profectum quaerere subditorum, sed quaestum pro∣prium; In summo praesertim omnium nihil turpius. Quam pulchre magister gentium;2 Cor. 12. 14  4. Parentes filiis, non filios debere censuit, the saurizare parentibus. Non mediocris gloriae vexilla identidem ipsius, non requiro datum, sed fructum. At jam transeamus & hinc, ne quis moram in his meam, avaritae in te notam interpretetur, &c. Hic locus avaritiam carpit, à quo vitio immunis satis tua opinio est, an et opus tu videris: Vidimus tamen, Germanicos detinuisse saccos, sed precio, non massa. Argen∣tum reputatum est fanum: summarii non levati sarcinis, onusti nihilominus repatriant vel inviti. Nova res: quando hactenus Roma aurum refudit? et nunc Romanorum consilio id usurpatum non credimus. (vi oblata à pauperibus.)
I shall adde his Notable passage of complaint against this and other Popes frequent exemptions of Abbots, Bishops and others (for mony) from subjection and obedi∣ence to their Superiors; by subjecting them immediately to the Pope himself: be∣cause his arguments against them hold as firmly in cases of Popes exempting them∣selves, and absolving Bishops, Clergymen, or Lay-subjects from allegiance and obe∣dience to their Princes: and gives a notable check to the pretented plenitude and absolutenesse of the Popes will and power to do what he pleaseth. Murmur loquor,De Consid. l. 4. f. 241. A. et querimoniam Ecclesiarum; Truncari se cla∣mitant, et demembrari vel nullae, vel paucae admodum sunt quae plagam istam non doleant, aut non timeant. Quaeris quam? Sub∣trahuntur Abbates Episcopis, Episcopi Archiepiscopis, Archie∣piscopi Patriarchis, sive Primatibus. (He might have as truly ad∣ded, Regibus & Imperatoribus suis:) Bona ne species haec? Mirum si excusari queat vel opus. Sic factitando probatis, vos habere ple∣nitudinem potestatis, sed justitiae forte non ita. Facitis hoc quia potestis; sed utrum et debeatis? quaestio est. Honoram ac dignita∣tum gradus & ordines quibusque suos servare positi estis, non invidere, ut quidam ve∣strorum ait;Rom. 13. Cui honorem honorem: Spiritualis homo ille, qui omnia dijudicat, ut ipse à nemine dijudicetur,1 Cor. 3. omne opus suum trina quadam consideratione praevenit. Primum quidem, an liceat? deinde, an deceat? postremò, an expediat? Nam etsi con∣stat in Christiana utique Philosophia, non decere nisi quod licet; non expedire, nisi quod decet, & licet; non tamen omne quod licet dicere aut expedire consequens erit. Age, ap∣temus si possumus tria ipsa aperae huic. At quomodo non indecens tibi volunta∣te pro lege uti; et quia non est ad quem appelleris, potestatem ex∣ercere, negligere rationem? Tunc major Domino tuo qui ait; Non veni facere voluntatem mea.Joan. 6. Quanquam non minus dejecti quam clati animi est veluti rationis expertem, non pro ratione, sed pro libitu agere, nec judicio agi sed appetitu. Quid tam bestiale? et si indignum cuivis utenti ratione vivere ut pecus, quis in te recto∣re omnium tantam contumeliam naturae, honoris injuriam ferat? Sic degenerando, quod absit, generale opprobrium fecisti proprium tibi: Homo cum in honore esset non intellexit, comparatus est jumentis insipien∣tibus, Psalm 49. 20. & similis factus est illis. Quid enim tam in dignum tibi, quam ut totum te∣nens, non sis contentus toto, nisi minutias quasdam atque exigu∣as portiones ipsius tibi creditae universitatis, tanquam non sint tuae, satagas nescio quomodo facere tuas? Ʋbi etiam meminisse te volo parabo∣lae Nathan,2 Reg. 12. de homine qui multas oves habens, unam quae erat pauperis concupivit, Huc quoque veniat factum,3 Reg. 21. imò facinus Regis Achab, qui rerum summam teebat, & unam vineam affectavit. Avertat Deus à te quod ille audivit; Occidisti & possedisti. Nolo autem praetendas fructus emancipaturis ipsius, nullus est eni, nisi quia inde E∣piscopi insolentiores, Monachi etiam dissolutiores fiunt: quid quod et pauperiores? Inspice diligentius talium ubique libertorum & facultates & vitas, si non pudenda admodum ut tenuitas in his, & in illis secularitas invenitur: Matris noxiae libertatis gemina soboles haec. Quid ni peccet licentius vagum, & malum liberum vul∣gus, cum non sit qui arguat? Quid ni licentius quoque spolietur ac depraedetur inermis re∣ligio, cum non sit qui defendat? Quo enim refugium illis? Nunquid ad Episcopos do∣lentes injuriam? Ridentibus profecto aspiciunt oculis, sive quae faciunt mala, sive quae pa∣tiuntur. Quae demum utilitas insanguine isto? Vereor ne illa quam in Propheta commi∣natus est Deuus,Ezeck. 3. ille, inquiens, in iniquitate sua morietur, sanguinem autem ejus de manu tua requiram. Si enim extollitur qui subtrahitur, & cui subtrahitur uritur, qui subtrahit quomodo Innocens? Parum est, involvimus ignemandi apertius, si is qui mur∣murat secundum animam mortuus est, qui instigat quomodo vivit? Quomodo non reus mortis amborum, et suae pariter, qui gladium dedit unde ambo morerentur? Hoc est quod dixeram,3 Reg. Occidisti & possedisti. Adde, quod qui audiunt scandalisan∣tur indignantur, detrahant & blasphemant, hoc est vulnerantur ad mortem. Non est bona arbor faciens fructus tales, insolentias, dissolutiones, dilapi∣dationes, simultates, scandala, odia, quodque magis dolendum in∣ter

Qum si forte nec licet, Ignosce mihi, non facile adducor licitum consentire quod tot illicita parturit. Tune denique tibi licitum censeas suis Ec∣clesias mutiare membris, confundere ordinem, pertubare terminos quos posurrunt Patres tui? Si justitiae est jus cuique fervare, au∣ferre euique sua, justo quomodo poterit convenire? Erras si ut sum∣mam, Ia et solam institutam a Deo vestram Aposolicam potesta∣tem existimas.Rom. 13. Si hoc sentis, dissentis ab eo qui ait, Non est potestas∣ a Deo.  quo, siquitur, qui potestati resisti Dei ordinatiom resistit, et si principaliter pro te facit, non tamen singulariter; Denique idem ait.Matth. 9. O  potestatibus su oribus subdita it. Non ait sublimio∣ri tanquam in uno, sed sublimioribus tanquam in multis. Non ergo tua sola potestas a Domino, sunt et mediocres, et sunt infe∣riores.

Nisi tu putas alium esse qui posuit in Ecclesia quosdam quidem Apostolos, quosdam autem Prophes, alios vero Evangelistas, alios Doctores & Patrores, ad consummationem Sanctorum in opus Ministerii, in aedificationem corporis Christi.

Quod si  Episcopas; Nolo esse sub Archipiscopo; aut Abbas, Nolo obedire Epis∣copo: hoc d coelo  est, nisi tu forte Angelorum quempiam dicentem audivisti, Nolo sub Archanglis esse, aut exalio quolibet inferiorum ordinum aliquem non ferentem sub∣esse Deo. Quid inquis, Prohibs dispensare non, sed dissipare. Non sum tam ,1 Cor. 4. 2. ut ignorem positos vos dispensatores, sed in aefirationem non in destructionem. Deind quaeritur inter dispensatores ut fidelis quis inventatur. Ubi necessitas urget, ex∣cusabilis dispnsatio est; Ubi  tas provocat, dispensatio laudabilis est: Vtilitas dico communis▪ non propria.
