His Majesties MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT, On Munday the 9th of November, 1685. My Lords and Gentlemen, AFter the Storm that seemed to be coming upon Us when We part∣ed last, I am glad to Meet you all again in so great Peace and Quietness, God Almighty be Prais∣ed, by whose Blessing that Rebel∣lion was Supprest: But when I Reflect what an inconsiderable Number of Men began it, and how long they carried it on with∣out any Opposition, I hope eve∣ry body will be convinced that the Militia, which hath hitherto been so much depended on, is not sufficient for such Occasions; And that there is nothing but a good Force of well Disciplined Troops in constant Pay, that can Defend Us from such as either at Home or Abroad are disposed to Disturb Us. And in truth, My Concern for the Peace and Quiet of My Sub∣jects, as well as for the Safety of the Government, made Me think it necessary to increase the Number to the Proportion I have done; This I owed as well to the Honour as to the Security of the Nati∣on, whose Reputation was so infinitely Exposed to all Our Neigh∣bours, by having layen Open to this late wretched Attempt, that it is not to be Repair'd without keeping such a Body of Men on foot, that none may ever have the Thoughts again of finding Us so mise∣rably unprovided; It is for the Support of this Great Charge which is now more than Double to what it was, that I ask your Assistance in giving Me a Supply answerable to the Expence it brings along with it; And I cannot doubt but what I have Begun so much for the Ho∣nour
and Defence of the Government, will be Continued by you with all the Cheerfulness and Readiness that is Requisite for a Work of so Great Importance. Let no man take Exceptions that there are some Officers in the Ar∣my not Qualified according to the late Tests, for their Imployments; The Gentlemen I must tell you are most of them well known to Me, and having formerly Served with Me in several Occasions, and al∣wayes approved the Loyalty of their Principles by their Practice, I think them fit now to be Imployed under Me, and will deal plainly with you, that after having had the Benefit of their Services in such time of need and danger, I will neither Expose them to disgrace, nor my Self to the want of them, if there should be another Rebellion to make them necessary to Me. I am afraid some Men may be so wicked to hope and expect, that a Difference may happen between you and Me, upon this Occasion, but when you consider what Advantages have arisen to Us in a few Months, by the good understanding We have hitherto had, what wonderful Effects it hath already produced in the change of the whole Scene of Affairs abroad, so much more to the Honour of the Nation, and the Figure it ought to make in the World, and that nothing can hinder a further Progress in this way to all Our Satisfactions, but Fears and Jealousies amongst Our Selves: I will not Apprehend that such a Misfortune can befall Us as a Division, or but a Coldness be∣tween Me and You; Nor that any thing can shake you in your Stea∣diness and Loyalty to Me, who by Gods Blessing will make you all Returns of Kindness and Protection; with a Resolution to Venture even My own Life, in the Defence of the true Interest of this King∣dom. FINIS.
