The English Womens Chastity; OR, The last SUNDAY Nights Frolick: Being a very True ACCOUNT of Three Eminent Citizens of London. Who by a sttange Mistake, unfortunatly Pickt up their own WIVES, last SUNDAY-Evening, in St. JAMES's Park; Whom they Treated with a Supper very Splendidly, at an Eminent Tavern, near CHARING-CROSS: With the Manner of their Discovery; and of the great Confusion of the whole Company thereupon. Being, indeed, not only a very Pleasant, but also a True Relation. IT was upon a Sunday Night (to sanctifie the Deed) when three Strowling Citizens, of supe∣rior Note, releas'd from Purgatory of a Compter, determin'd to gratifie their Lungs with a little fresh air, and after the duty of the day was over, which no doubt they had performed with the usual City devotion, they very amicably took a Walk into St. James's Park: The Matrons at home, being Ladies of singular Intelligence▪ were timely enough acquainted with their Husbands determination, Mrs. A—having the first advice brought to her, posted away with mighty Expedition to Mrs E—'s, where the matter was not long a debating, being Ladies of an admirable invention; and the Resolve was, that they should put on disguises, and go incognito in pursuit of their Husbands, that care and pleasure should separatly occupy the Fa∣mily. The Ladies thus equipped, pursued their Stratagem in Masquerade, and soon arrived at the Park; where they were often attacked by the Beaux and Sparks, but they being in quest of a Nobler Game (tho naturally coming and complying enough) did very tyranically repulse all the Courtship and Solicitations of these Gallants▪ and very bravely made good their way, till at length they came in view of their appointed Quarry, and drawing towards them with all the Tricks and Artifices of Women of the Town. Mr. A—made the motion to meet them, and carry them to a Glass of Wine, being of an even number, and promising well enough to deserve their fare, the motion was agreed to by the other two, and referred to Mr. A▪ be∣ing a Man of the greatest Assurance and Presence of Mind) to manage; and accordingly, Don Formalioso, with a Spanish Stiffness, makes up to the Ladies, and accosts them with Tropes and Figures, and a dull Harangue of Costive Rhetorick, (his natural Stile, wherein he excuseth the Modestly and Bashfulness of his two friends, tho' Citts, and Married too; yet for them and him self he gave them a hearty invitation to a Glass of Wine. The Ladies gave their consent by their Silence; or by saying very little at most, being sparing of their specch, for fear of Discovering themselves; so, in short, every on takes his Bird, and hastes to a certain Tavern at Charing-Gross; knowing the nights being short, their Wives would look for them home in good time, or else lead 'em a weary Life all the week after, with hard service in bed and hard Bargains i'th Shop, as soon as they came to the Tavern, like generous Hearts, they spoke for a Supper of a Price, and orderd it to be hastned with all Speed, and in the mean time call'd most incontinently for Wine, and drank very freely whilst Supper was making ready; But here was the most deverting Scene as Fortune would have it, who seldom stumbles over or interupts such intrigues, each makes choise of his own wife, whither for Rallary, or the last Favours I know not, (an unhappy choise and a sign that they did not know them; And here they all strove for the most soft and engaging Expressions of Love, and here they boast∣ed and bounced of strenuous Vigour, and youthful performances, which these disguised Ladies had too often found experimentally false, in the disconsolat and legitimate bed, and yet perhaps these Gentlemen might have been sincere too, For some can never do the Trick to Per∣fection, but in a Baudy bouse. But, by this time Supper was brought up, and the conditions ended that they must now Unmask, which when the waiters were commanded to retire, they performed, and put an end to the Farce by discovering themselves to be their wives, and the whole company 3 whole pair of Legitimate Upholders of the race man, Tho I think they had not been very successfull neither. But here you may imagine what a surprize & confusion arose in the whole company, & had not the sparks been very generous in their entertainment, they had not been considerable sufferers with the pleasure of the Discovery, and the Diversion of good Wine, and a Supper, which in the midst of all their Passion, they were too wise to spoil, the Ladies were so far mitigated as to keep the King's Peace, and their Fingers off their Husbands Faces. So, in short the Com∣pany soon broke up, and they all parted, the Wives to the Triumph of their Discovery, and the Husbands to the Severest Discipline that ever Men, besides Cools, Culles, and Cits, were ex∣posed to▪ This Frolick was performed on Sunday last.
