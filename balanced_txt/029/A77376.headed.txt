A perfect Narrative of the Grounds and Reasons moving some Officers of the Army in Ireland to the securing the Castle of Dublin for the Parliament, &c. AS no Nation in the World hath been exer∣cised (in so short a tract of time) with more prodigious Revolutions then England; so is it as admirable to observe the manifold astonishing Providences that are the Con∣comitants of such marvellous and frequent Alterations in this State and Commonwealth. The Spirit of the living Creature hath moved in this great Wheel: This Bush hath been often a fire, but hitherto not consumed: God doth often threaten and shake his angry rod over, yet seems unwilling to ruine these Nations. And albeit the first Part is always acted on the English Stage, the Irish and Scotish Nations are so far influenced thereby, that they become participants more or less in her Peace or War, in her prosperity and adversity. To demonstrate this
truth, We having (as we hope) been set on work by the Lord, in the contriving and execution of the late Change in Ireland, by the evil reports we have heard of that ser∣vice, since our repair to this City, finding it necessary, have thought it our duty to expose to publike view this Narrative of the dealings of God with the Irish Nation; to prevent and remove those disingenuous Misinformati∣ons cast upon that action, by sundry disaffected persons to the Parliaments cause and interest, and whose malevo∣lent aspects did eminently contribute to their late Inter∣ruption, or to the continuance of it. And waving all former actions, shall only reflect upon those that have been immediately previous, or attending, or succeeding that great Enterprise in Ireland. And this we shall do faithfully, and succinctly. The laying aside the Single Person, was the bringing in the Parliament; which after some years discontinuance, was in May 1659. restored to the exercise of their power by the Army in England, and after owned with general acclamations and Addresses from all places, and particu∣larly from Ireland. The honor of which universal com∣pliance from the Army to the Parliament, was snatch∣ed away by a sort of people, whose affections to the wages of unrighteousness, hath characterized them in all the three Nations; and did appropriate that to them∣selves alone, blasting as Malignants others really zealous in that great work: They who were best affected to the Parliament, and most forward in their Addresses, being by those men branded as Enemies to the Parliament, under the notion of having once adhered to the Single Person, although the owning that power in the Single Person, had been in them nothing more then what had
been in the generality of the three Nations, and that after (to a general satisfaction) obliterated by an Act of In∣dempnity: And notwithstanding that having had prefer∣ments and advantages above others by the Single Person, none had been more forward in adoring that very power in the Single Person, then those very men, who after so upbraided it as a crime in others. These very men were they, who above others rejoiced in the dissolving the Parliament by the Protector in the year 1653. And these were they who were for the Rising Sun, and were emi∣nently industrious in framing and carrying on Addresses to it, from all places; after all which, having with the Adulterous woman wiped their mouths, they say, We have done no wickedness. And strange it is, even to astonish∣ment, how they gained belief with that very Parliament, on which they (even they) had so trampled: And that notwithstanding all the evils, then, and after breaking out upon the Nations, flowed from themselves actually, or occasionally; yet were they esteemed Children of peace, nay Sufferers, and all those evils charged upon others. And it is to be admired (these things considered) by what artifices they should so winde themselves into almost a Supremacie of power in Ireland, kept under them in very vassalage, whereby in the after-change England it self might have been hazarded. Nor will it be from the purpose, to observe in part the Method artificially pro∣ceeded in, for carrying on their destructive designs, almost unobserved until the three Nations had been in the evils thereof well-nigh overwhelmed. First, they laboured the securing to themselves the Army in Ireland, in the modelling thereof in England, they having the nomination, and presenting all Com∣mission
Officers, who were such as for the most part were fixed to their Interests, in whatsoever Changes; so as of more then forty Field-Officers, there were but a very few but what carried on their designs; In the mean while ex∣cluding by misinformations (secret and at distance) Sir Hardress Waller, Sir Charls Coote, Colonel Ingoldsby, Co∣lonel Theophilus Jones, Colonel Flower, Colonel Redman, Major Eyres, Lieutenant Colonel. Bret, Major Read, Major Stanley, and others of known integrity, and all this by false suggestions of Colonel Axtel, Colonel Barrow, Co∣lonel Sankey, Mr. Roberts, Doctor Worsley, Doctor Hard∣ing &c. then in London, and most of them after hasten∣ing into Ireland, for compleating there what remained of the modelling that Army, as to inferior Officers. Secondly, they singled out, and gained persons to be entrusted with the Government of the Army and Nation fitted for their turn, such were Lieutenant General Lud∣low, Colonel Jones, Mr. Corbet, and Colonel Thomlinson, by which their Instruments (rather then Masters) they in effect ruled, and thereby fixed in themselves, and in the hands of their Confidents the principal places of strength in the Nation, victualling each place with three months provision, together with the County Militiaes, and even the management also of civil things, as to Sheriffs, Justi∣ces of Peace &c. By all which, 'tis most apparent, Ireland was intended for their place of refuge, in their distress elsewhere, and so had it been found to the disturbance of the three Nations, had Lieutenant General Ludlow in this juncture been admitted (as he hoped) into his former com∣mand, he having been sent for to that end from London, by that party in Ireland, and sent thence to that purpose by express orders from the Lord Fleetwood.
Thirdly, that part of the Army in England under their apostatized General, having contrary to all Faith and Al∣legiance in October last, again disturbed the Parliaments sitting; it was then the time for that party in Ireland, to put in practice what had been before designed; whereunto indeed they seemed to be now necessitated, for their new created General had ordered by his Letters to the Com∣mander in cheif of the Parliaments forces in Ireland, that subscriptions should be taken throughout the Army, for owning the Lord Fleetwood as General, and Colonel Lam∣bert as Major General &c. though in direct opposition to the Parliament, who enacted and declared to the contra∣ry; it being further by such subscriptions intended that the Army in Ireland should be engaged for the Army in England against the Parliament. The Lord Fleetwood had then required as aforesaid an Election of Agents out of each Regiment, to be sent in∣to England for assisting with others in framing, propose∣ing and imposing a new Model of Government for the three Nations &c. to the subvertion of the fundamental Laws, and the very being of Parliaments, and the Liber∣ties of the good people of these Nations in Parlia∣ment. Herein is Lieutenant General Ludlow active in London, by his Letters to his substitute Colonel Jones, and to o∣thers in Ireland; herein are Colonel Jones, Mr. Corbet, and Colonel Thomlinson, concurring and acting vigorously; therein falsifying their Faith to the Parliament, contrary to the high trust as Commissioners of Parliament reposed in them, which their former Title of Commissioners of Parliament, they cast off, assuming another of Com∣missioners of the Commonwealth, that their Guilt be
not read in their Forehead, and in the Front of publick Declarations &c. And by all of them orders transmitted into the several Quarters for hasting the subscriptions and Elections mentioned. For prevention whereof, or giving at least some stop to such their pernicious actings against the Parliament, and for preserving (if it might be) the Parliaments interest in Ireland, about October last it was from the Lord on the Spirits of his Servants (some dissenting Officers about Dublin) to consider of some probable meanes to that pur∣pose. But the Danger being evident that there should be meetings of such who declared dissatisfactions and dissen∣ted from such acting, and protested publickly against such designes against the Parliament; therefore the said dissent∣ing Officers for giving some colour to their waies, with less jealousie, pretended the carrying on a Petition to the Commander in chief, Colonel Jones, for a gene∣rall Councel of Officers to meet at Dublin to consider of those great and weighty affairs, wherein three Nations were so highly concerned; by which general Councel (if meeting) it was hoped that a check might be given to the other party, and that the hands of the dissenters might be strengthned for the Parliament; or if such a general meeting of Officers on such an occasion should have bin denyed by the Commander in Chief, it would probably returne on him and his wayes with greater disadvantage; and in the mean time it was conceived that the private meetings of the said Dissenting Officers, might be with less suspition, supposed to be in order to the matter only of their Petition mentioned: And for giving yet more countenance to this their designe, it was by them con∣cluded,
that Sir Hardress Waller the Major General, should be moved to appeare in the head of them, before the Commander in chief and the Commissioners of Par∣liament, for setting forward that desire for a general Councel of Officers; which he freely promised to do, And for gaining to themselves a party abroad under the same covert of a Petition for a general Councel of Officers, the said Dissenting Officers sent out into the several Quarters a Petition to be subscribed to that purpose▪ whereby they gained as to so much with their friends, with whom they else where Corresponded; they also there∣by hindred in a great measure those Subscriptions pomo∣ted by the Lord Fleetwood, and his Instruments in Ire∣land. Thereupon Colonel Iones the deputed Commander in chief, well foreseeing what might be the Issue and Sequel of such Actings; and understanding the Inconveniencs of not Assenting to that Councel of Officers desired, (which had bin on the first motion rejected); taking new Co∣cels, he resolveth on a Complying with that therein pro∣posed by the Dissenting Officers before the Petition was delivered; Yet to make it insignificant to their ends, he had fixed for that purpose on the meeting of those new elected Officers appointed for the meeting in England, who within few dayes were expected in Dublin, and were sup∣posed persons made for that purpose, and that by this meanes also his so yielding to the Petitioners, might prove an expedient for stopping their further prosecution of that their Petition in other places, that hereby the said Dis∣senting Officers might be rendered secure, until they should be surprised and laid up safe; which he intended at the coming in of his Juncto of Officers, whom he expected;
for he the said Colonel Jones had to that end advised with General Fleetwood, who by his Letters intercepted, ordered the securing them the Dissenting Officers, and the dis∣arming all others in the Nation not of their party. The said Dissenting Officers being now awakened and sensible of the danger to themselves, but principally of that threatned to the three Nations, and the Parliaments In∣terest therein, they thereupon found it necessary to put speedily in Execution, although but with few hands, what had bin before resolved; in order whereunto on the 12. of December last they fixed their Resolution, for acting the very next day to the seizing, and securing the Castle of Dublin; and of those the Parliaments Commissioners so Perfidiously acting against their trust. Some difficulties interposed in the manner, particularly that of five Companies of Foot Quartered in Dublin, four being of Colonel Lawrences Regiment, and three Troops of Horse brought in by Collonel Jones for the security of the Castle and those of his party, not any one of them had bin hitherto prepared for the work. The persons also managing that work to Execution were but few (viz) Colonel Bridges, Major Edward Warren, Leivtenant Colonel John Warren, Captain Abel Warren, Leivtenant John Thompson, Colonel Theophilus Jones, Captain Jeonar, Captain Daniel Lisle, Colonel Warden, and Captain Bond, by whose Foot Company then upon an outgard the Castle was surprised; notwithstanding which, and many other difficulties, the Persons mentioned com∣mitting the Parliaments Cause in their hands to the Lord, and willingly offering up themselves, and all deare unto them for a reasonable Sacrifice to the publick, according to former resolutions on the 13 December about five of the
Clock in the afternoon they first Surprised the Castle, wherein but the very day before was laid up 500. Bar∣rels of Powder newly landed, besides the former store, and intended for other ends; they afterward secured Colonel Jones, Cheif Baron Corbet, and Colonel Thomlinson, the Commissioners before mentioned; and having declared for the Parliament throughout the City of Dublin, they were met with general Accla∣mations from the highest to the lowest, both Army and others, expressing all joy, except such as were of the Adverse party; and all this through mercy without one drop of Blood, or so much as Tumult. This whole work was begun and perfected within less then two houres, and within less then so many weeks, in like manner almost throughout the whole Nation; And the very same night Colonel Edmond Temple, received Orders for imbodying of five Troops of Horse, with which he afterward reduced Collonel Pritty, then standing out against the Parliament in Catherlo Castle. It now behoving those thus ingaged to put themselves into that order whereby the work in their hands might be carryed on (by the blessing of the Lord) the more Prosperously, and considering the countenance they might have in that action by the Major General, if he would own them in it, they thereupon desired his heading them, and that by his hand Orders might pass upon all occasions, he being the visible Superior Officer then in Ireland, whereunto (they, and that under∣taking appearing for the Parliament) he assented: he having been some weeks before prepared by some ge∣neral discourse concerning it.
After upon the Fourteenth of December, was pub∣lished the Declaration for the Parliament, which be∣ing transmitted by the Post into all parts, with the particulars of the success, which the Lord was plea∣sed to give unto them his poor weak Instruments in his Service, they had thereupon daily returnes of joy∣full approbations, and the owning of their work and profession for the Parliament against all opposition; and herein is to be remembred to the honor of the City of Dublin, the readiness and alacrity manifested in this work by the Mayor and Citizens, generally, both in the first taking of the business, the very first night, and afterwards drawing the City Militia into the field, which consisted of about 2000 foot, beside horse, for the service of the Parliament, and still holding on with that faithfulness and zeal which can be expected from them. Also Sir Charles Coot Lord President of Connaught, having cast off the Subscriptions expected from him and his Forces in that Province, his Lordship with his party declared for the Parliament, and secured the Town of Galway, and those therein, refusing to joyn with him in owning the Parliament; his Lordship did after re∣duce Colonel Brafield, rendezvouzing and holding out the Castle of Athlone against the Parliament, and in a short time, setled the whole Province, and signified by Letters to the Officers in Dublin, that he was ready with his forces, for what should be further for the Par∣liaments service. The like Affairs of the Province of Munster, was carried on by the management of the Lord Broghill, who
with great care and dilligence, secured Youghall, Bandon, Kinsale and other places considerable: The City of Cork also declared for the Parliament, by meanes of the Citizens and private Soldiers, notwithstanding that Colonel Phayer the Governor there, with Colonel Wal∣lis, and others of that party, had laboured much to the contrary, was secured by Major Wilson, whose be∣haviour was eminent: Also Limerick and Waterford by Lieutenant Colonel Leigh, who appeared faithful to the Parliament in that great streight. As to Vlster, Londonderry being secured by Colonel Gorges, there was little remaining in that Province of considerable opposition; all there being soon quieted, especially on the decease of Colonel Cooper, Gover∣nor of that Province, who died in his Chair about the 21. of December. Matters being thus, through the Blessing of God, in some goodmeasure ordered at home, the Councel of Of∣ficers in Dublin, now settle themselves on dispatches a∣broad, as for giving a right understanding of themselves and their Proceedings, so for strengthning as they hoped, the hands of their Friends elsewhere, coopera∣ting in the same cause with them, and accordingly they did by several Expresses, give a particular accompt to General Monck in Scotland; also to the Parliaments Commissioners of the Army in Portsmouth, and to the Lord Mayor of London. And for the better carrying on the work, the Lord Broghill, and the Lord President of Connaught, were desired by the Council of Officers to repair to Dublin, on whose Judgment and prudent management of af∣fairs
they much depended; by whose coming were their Councels and actings more enlivened, and all others better satisfied. And for securing the Army to the Parliaments interests, and that the endeavors of those attempting the contrary might be prevented, It was for that end concluded as absolutely necessary, that the Army in Ireland should be forthwith setled, by removing those from Commands who were dis∣affected to the Parliament, and placing others in their room, of whose good affections to the Parliament they might be confident. Therefore did the Council of Officers set themselves upon a temporary model∣ing of the Army, until the Parliaments pleasure should be therein known; hoping that their end in it (purely the Service of the Parliament) would be accepted: In which their said Model were laid aside only such as opposed the Parliament in the Revolutions in England, or here, or of whose not acting against the Parliament they could not be satisfied: And such only as shewed themselves friends to the Parliament, were imployed. On the 31. of December, came into the Bay of Dublin Lieutenant-General Ludlow, who from aboard the Oxford-Frigat signified his being there, and ex∣pected admittance to the head of the Army as Com∣mander in chief, which he had by Commission from the Parliament before its interruption. Whereunto, for the reasons before mentioned, as also for many other causes, all expressed in a Charge already exhi∣bited against the said Lieutenant-General Ludlow and others to the Parliament; It was therefore resolved,
That it was not consistent with the safety of the Par∣liaments Interest in Ireland, that Lieutenant-General Ludlow should be received into the Head of the Army, until the Parliaments pleasure, on hearing of what should be objected to him, should be signified concerning him. And in regard of his so hovering in the Bay of Dublin, whereby he was at hand in order to distra∣ctions in the City, which was threatned and expected by his party there, who might be considerable if head∣ed by those Officers then prisoners at Dublin, secured for their opposition to the Parliament, and conceived dangerous by reason of their interests and disaffection to the Parliament; therefore did the Council of Of∣ficers conceive it necessary, that the prisoners then in the City should be dispersed and disposed into places more remote, particularly Colonel John Jones was thereupon removed to the Castle of Athlone, and others elswhere. And whereas Miles Corbet Esquire, and Colonel Thomlinson, had in their restraint the favor of a con∣finement to their houses, until the Parliaments plea∣sure concerning them should be known, respect being had to the Charge to be presented against them also; and that he the said Mr. Corbet had fled to Lieutenant-General Ludlow then in the Bay of Dublin; there∣upon was Colonel Thomlinson removed, and for better security of his person, restrained in the Castle of Dublin. And having thus far proceeded in setling and se∣curing the Parliaments Interest and Authority in Ire∣land;
It was also judged expedient by the Major-General and Council of Officers there, during the Parliaments interruption, to take some speedy order (in regard of the pressing necessity of the Army, then sixteen moneths behind of their pay) for the raising of money for the present maintenance of them. The Council of Officers did advise, That two persons of each County, and the like number of each City and chief Town, should be elected by the Protestant in∣habitants of the said places, and the Electors and Elected to be such persons as always manifested their good affections to the Parliament, and not then in Arms; who were to meet in Dublin so to raise money by way of Loan, for the temporary supply of the Forces, that so they might not perish, nor be exposed to the many temptations that such a condition may leave them open unto, and also to prevent the Free-quartering of the Army upon the Inhabitants of the Country, a grievance not long to be borne. But with∣in a few days after, they having received information of the Parliaments sitting, which came to them some days before the meeting of that Convention; the Council of Officers sent forth their Dispatches into all Counties and places to stop such meeting, which was accordingly done. And this is the true accompt of the proceedings in this affair, which hath made so great a noise in this City, as if they in Ireland were setting up for themselves, and calling a Parliament to govern and manage the affairs of that Nation, in opposition to the Parliament of England.
And for giving the Parliament a due representation of the State of these Affairs in Ireland, the Council of Officers there have chosen, and ordered us to be their Commissioners to attend the Parliament for that purpose; and to indeavour to rid that Army from the insulting Pride and Bondage, under which they had groaned by an Anabaptistical, and Notionall Party, from whom proceeded all those confusions, and revo∣lutions this Parliament and Commonwealth have been exercised, which for some years past, whose casting out as to their over-ruling Power in Ireland, (if owned by the Parliament) may be (it is hoped) to the other Nations, a deliverance also from the like future evils by that kinde of men. And thus with much integrity and faithfulness, unto that Army whereof we are unworthy Members, have we given a just accompt of what the Lord hath done in that Nation for his people, wherein we have pur∣posely omitted many remarkable Circumstances that attended this great action, least we might appear ei∣ther unnecessarily tedious, or foolishly vain glorious; Whereas our aimes are nakedly and sincerely, that God might have the Glory, the Nations setled up∣on an honest Basis, and that those prejudices that had been occasioned against the late Proceedings in that Nation, by the bespattering reports of ma∣lignant Tongues and Pens, might be removed or silenced; So we desire, that all that fear God, and honor Magistracy and good Government, would joyn with us in blessing our gracious God, whose
ways are inscrutable for delivering that and these Nati∣ons from the raging power of a devouring Sword; and that our supplications may be united for the settlement of Peace, with Truth among us; That every one may sit under his own Vine and Fig-Tree, none making them affraid. John Bridges, Edward Warren, Abel Warren. FINIS.
