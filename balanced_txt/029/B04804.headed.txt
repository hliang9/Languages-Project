A pretty Ballad of the Lord of Lorn, and the False Steward. The Tune is, Green Sleeves IT was a worthy Lord of Lorn, he was a Lord of high degree, He sent his son unto the School, to learn some civility. He learned more in one day, then other Children did in three, And then bespake the School-master, unto him tenderly. In faith thou art the honestest boy, that e're I blinkt on with mine eye: I hope thou art some Easterling born, the Holy Ghost is with thee: He said he was no EasterIing born, the child thus answered courteously, My Father is the Lord of Lorn, and I his Son perdye. The School master turned round about, his angry Mood he could not swage: He marvelled the Child could speak so wise, he being of so tender age. He girt the Saddle to the Steed, the Bridle of best gold shown, He took his leave of his fellows all, and quickly he was gone. And when he came to his Father dear, he kneeled down upon his knee, I am come to you father, he said, Gods blessing give you me: Thou art welcome my son, he said, Gods blessing I thee give: What tidings hast thou brought my Son, being come so hastily, I have brought tidings Father, he said, and so liked it may be: There's ne'r a book in all Scotland, but I can read it truly: And there's ne'r a Doctor in all the Realm, for all he goes in rich array, I can write him a Lesson soon, to learn in seven years day: That is good tydings, said the Lord, all in the place where I do stand, My Son thou shalt into France go, to learn the speeches of each land: Who shall go with him, said the Lady? husband we have none but he: Madam, he said, my head Steward, he hath been true to me. She call'd the Steward to an account, a thousand pound she gave him anon, Says, good sir-Steward be good to my child when he is far from home: If I be false unto my young Lord, then God be like unto me indeed. And now to France they both are gone, and God be their good speed: They had not bee in France in Land, not three wéeks to an end, But meat nor drink the child got none, nor money in Purse to spend. The child runs to the Rivers side, he was fain to drink water then, And after followed ye false Steward to put the Child therein: But nay marry, said the Child, be asked mercy pitifully, Good steward let me have my life, what e're bete my body. Now put off thy fair cloathing, and give it meanon, So put thée off thy silken shirt, with many a golden seam. But when the child was stript naked, his body white as the lifly flower, He might have been seen for his body, a Princess Parmour, He put him on an old Kelter Coat, and hose of the same above the Knee, He bid him go to the Shepherds house, to keep sheep on a love lovely: The child said, what shall be my name, good Steward tell to me, Thy name shall be poor dost thou wear, that thy name shall be. The child came to the Shepherds house, and asked mercy pitifully, Says, good Shepherd take me in, to keep sheep on a loo lovely, But when the Shepherd saw the child, he was so pleasant in the eye, I have no child, I'le make thee my heir, thou shalt have my goods perdye. And then bespake the Shepherds wife, unto the Child so tenderly, Thou must take the sheep & go to the field, and get them on a love lovely: Now let us leave talk of the child, that is keeping sheep on a love lovely, And we'l talk more of the false Steward, and of his false treachery; He bought himself three suits of apparel that any Lord might a seem'd to worn, He went a wooing to the Dukes daughter and cal'd himself the Lord of Lorn. The Duke he welcomes the young Lord, with three aed stags anon, If he had wist his the false Steward, to the devil he should have gone: But when they were at supper set, with dainty decates that were there, The D. said, if th wilt wed my daughter I'le give thee thousand pound a year: The Lady woul se the red buck run, and also for o nt the Doe, And with a hundrd lusty men, the Lady did hunting go. The Lady is a hting gone, over Feansel cat is so high, There was she are of a shepherds boy, with sheep on love lovey: And ever he sig and made moan, and cryed out ittyfully, My Father is the Lord of Lorn and knows not what's become of me. And then bespake the Lady gay, and to her mad she spake anon, Go fetch me hithr the Shepherds boy, why maketh h all this mone? But when he cae before the Lady, he was not to earn his courtesie, Where wast tho born thou bonny child, for whose sake nakst thou all this moan? My dearest-friend, Lady he said. is dead many years agon. Tell thou to me thou bonny child, tell me the truth and do not lie, Know'st thou not the young Lord of Lorn? he is come a wooing unto me: Yes forsooth, said the child, I know the Lord then verily: The young Lord is a valiant Lord, at home in his own Country. Wilt leave thy sheep thou bonny child, and come in service unto me, Yes forsooth then said the Child, at your bidding will I be. When the Steward lookt upon the Child, he be wail'd him villanously, Where wast thou born thou Vagabond, or where is thy Country? Ha down ba down said the Lady, she cal'd the Steward then presently, Without you ear him more good will, you get no love of me: Then bespake the false Steward, unto the Lady hastily: At Abardine beyond the Sea, his Father robbed thousands three. BVt then bespake the Lady gay, unto her Father courteously, Saying, I have found a bonny child, my Chamberlain to be: Not so, not so, then said the Duke; for so it may not be, For the young Lord of Lorn ye comes a woo∣ing, will think no good of thee and me. When the Duke had lookt upon the child, he seem'd so pleasant to the eye: Child, because thou lovest Horses well, my Groom of Stable thou shalt be. The Child plyed the Horses well, a twelve month to an end, He was so courteous and so true, every man becomes his friend: He led a fair Gelding to the water, where he may drink verily, The Gelding up with his head and hit the Child above the eye: Wo worth the Horse, then said the Child that ever Mare foled thee, Thou little knowst what thou hast done, thou hast striken a Lord of high degree. The Ds. daughter was in her garden gréen she heard the Child make great moan, She ran to the child all weeping, and left her Maidens all alone. Sing on thy song thou bonny child, I will release thee of thy pain, I have made an oath Lady, he said, I dare not tell my tale again Tell the horse thy tale thou bonny child, and so thy oath-shall saved be, But when he told the horse his tale, the Lady wept most tenderly. I'le do for thee my bonny child, in faith I will do more for thee, And for thy sake my bonny child, I'le put my wedding off months three, The Lady did write a Letter then, full pitifully with her own hand: She sent it to the Lord of Lorn, whereas he dwelt in fair Scotland: But when the Lord had read the letter, his Lady wept most tenderly, I knew what would become of my Child, in such a far Countrey. The old Lord cal'd up his merry men, and all that he gave Cloth and Fee, With seven Lords by his side, and into France rides he; The wind serv'd, and they did fail, so far into France Land: They were wear of the Lord of Lorn, with a Porters staff in his hand: The Lords they moved hat and hand, the Serving-men fell on their knee, VVhat folks be yonder said the steward, that make the Porter courtesie: Thou art a false thief, quoth the L. of Lorn, no longer might I bear with thee: By the Law of France thou shalt be judg'd, whither it be to live or dye. A Quest of Lords there chosen was, to bench they came hastily: But when the Quest ended was, the false steward must dye. First they did him half hang, and then they took him down anon, And then put him in boyling lead and then was sodden breast and bone: And then bespake the Lord of Lorn, with many other Lords more, Sir Duke if you be as willing as we, we'l have a Marriage before we go: These Children both they did rejoyce to hear the Lord his tale so ended, They had rather to day then to morrow, so he would not be offended. But when the wedding ended was, their was delicate dainty cheer, I'le tell you how long the wedding did last full three quarters of a year. Such a banquet there was wrought, the like was never seen, The K. of France brought with him then a hundred Tun of good red wine: Five set of Mustians were to be séen, that never rested night nor day, Also Italians there did sing, full pleasantly with great joy. Thus have you heard what troubles great unto successive joys did turn, And happy news amongst the rest, unto the worthy Lord of Lorn. Let Rebels therefore warned be, how mischief once they do pretend, For God may suffer for a time, but will disclose it in the end. FINIS. London, Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, and
