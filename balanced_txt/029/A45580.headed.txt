Reason in Season: OR, A VVORD on the Behalf of the NON-COLLEGIATE PHYSICIANS And of the Right of the People IN THE Choice of their Physicians. By A. Hargrave, PHILO MEDICƲS. Magna est Veritas, et praevalebit. Printed in the Year 1676.
Reason in Season, &c. FOrasmuch as there was never any Prohibition of the Practice of Physick or Chy∣rurgery to those that had Skill therein, until the time of King Henry the 8th, it is to be presumed, that the Exercise of these Arts is Common Right. For our Kings and Governours had no such Thoughts, as some now have, that the E∣ducations of the Universities only capacitated Persons for that Practice; because, had they so judged, it cannot be imagined they would, for so many Hundreds of Years, in a Nation of such pregnant Faculties, have forborn to specifie their Re∣sentment thereof; especially considering, that the Clergy (the Original and Support of Academick Learning, were the great Ministers of State, for the most part under every King since the Conquest; and how easie it had been for them, had they (seeing they ruled All) apprehended it Essential to Healing, may be judg∣ed by every Rational Man. Nor doth it appear by that Act of the third of Henry the 8th, where the Bi∣shops are the Licensers of Physick, that there was ought of other Learning requir∣ed, then Judgment in the Faculty; because it was appointed by that Act, They should call to their Assistance any Four Teachers thereof; and as if this also were thought too great an Infringment of Liberty, it was by another Act of Parliament in the 34th Year of the said King's Reign (taking no notice, if there were any such, of that in the 14th and 15th Year of the same King) ordered, That Any that had Skill in Herbs, Roots, Waters, or to cure any Outward Sores, the Stone, Stranguries, Agues and Impesthumes; not withstanding any thing specified in the former Act, should have Liberty so to do: and good Reason. For they found that Limitation of Practice to a set Number increased Pride and Covetousness (grand Hindrances to the Improvement of Physick) and the Diressed wanted Help, and they that did them Good were Troubled for so doing, as the Preamble to that Act sufficiently manifests. Now, although some may Object, This later Act was only made against that Branch of the former which concerned Chyrurgeons; yet you may without Diffi∣culty discern that Agues. the Stone and Stranguries (Distempers not cured by Out∣ward Medicines) are referred to Any Persons skilful therein. Yea, the very Letter of the Act, specifying Knowledge in Herbs, Roots and Waters (Chymical Spirits and other Preparations of theirs being at that time unknown) doth undeniably de∣monstrate some part of Physicians Practice, if not the better part. For though Col∣ledgiate Physicians (through Ignorance & Idleness) refer the Stone to the Knife, and so make it a part of Chyrurgery; yet the Stone in the Kidneys (all men know) the Knife never reached; & where one is troubled with the former, there are six, if not
ten with the latter and can any one think, that that Act should only or simply respect Chyrurgery. For in Aus, though they are sometimes cured by Topicks, most men now know, that internal Remedies are more efficacious. The Strangury out∣ward Medicines could never cure; to testisie which I call to witness the Calamities of the Sick, and the Error of Physicians (marked with a Bloody Character) who, by doting on the Stone & outward Remedies, have neglected the One thing necessary, viz. the Assistance of the Physical Man, and by that means miserably prostrated their Pati∣ents to Death Wherefore we may reasonably conclude, that Parliament never intended to make the Power given to Physicians as a Bar to Natural Endowments, or the Improvements of others in any wise relating to the cure of the sick. And although by Mis-infor∣mation they had enthroned Colledgiates as Judges, yet (upon sense of their Inabili∣ties) they were willing to curtayl their Power. A sufficient Demonstration, that the Limitation of Physick never arose Naturally as needful; but, by surprise of per∣sons in authority, with pretences of what was not. It is also to be considered that in none of the Acts, made during that King's Reign, was any thing specified to limit the Practice of Physick to those only that were Academical; and although men now dote upon that kind of learning (which as we would not contemn, so we are unwil∣ling too much to adore) yet 'tis to be presumed, our Ancestors left Nature free to bring forth her own Virtues, as all the fore-going Generations before that time had done; especially when they saw the limitation to a particular, so far to endanger the who. For if we contemplate the original of Physick, it oweth not its Birth to any Academy, it having had its being long before they were known in the world. Nor had it its Rise in Societies, but in and from particular persons, as (in the former Ages of the world from Hermes, Machaon, Esculapius, Hippocrates, &c. and (in the latter) from Basil Valentine, Paracels, Alexander Suchte Helmont, &c. Hippocrates indeed, though a Man descended from the Race of Physicians, was reckoned the Founder thereof; and because he cured the Plague. dged to be endowed with a Divine Nature (as Petus, Physician to Artar, testified to his Master) and to have done more in his single Person, then all his Ancestors had  and this same Man also, by his Volumns written, hath so far proved his Gifts, as to be esteem'd the Patron of Physick, though we do not find him acquainted with ought but his Mother Tongue. And that it was so, is probable enough, seeing Collegiates and Academists confess, and the World knows, that Natural Gifts arise not from nor are tyed to lear∣ning of Languages; for if they were, then every Man, who hath learned French, Dutch, Spanish; or any other Language besides his own should necessarily he endow∣ed with more Excellent Gifts then others, the contrary of which is daily obvious. Nor can there be at this day such Pretences for Academick Learning, as heretofore might have been, in order to the understanding of Physick; because the Sum of all that hath been written by the Ancients, is now in the English Tongue, although at the time of that Act making it was lockt up in other Languages. Moreover, Chymistry (the great Ornament of Physicians and Benefit to the Sick)
was not so much as thought of to be essential to the Practice of Physick; but of la∣ter times, experience testifies, little can be effected therein without it. And it is ap∣parently evident, that Colledgiates have made very small Progress therein; but those that are not of them (and whom they at this day persecute) have solely aimed at, and brought to Light, such Remedies as do more easily, safely and speedily effect the Cure of the Sick, then the Medicines of their Dispensatory can at this day, What! shall we then defend a shadow, that cannot benefit us, and destroy a substance, that helpeth to preserve us? The Colledge alledge their Education, as great Help to their Capacities; yet when we consider of it, we shall not find it amounts to more then a Memorative Know∣ledge of what they have read; and what this can advantage us, is easie to judge. For, since we live in a Climate and Time, where & when no Disease is so apparent∣ly single, as to answer the Description of the Ancients, how shall what they have said advantage the sick, when the present Distempers were not in former times known? That this is true, the Observation of many years hath proved: for Col∣legiates themselves are frequently crying out, This is a New Distemper. Therefore if we rightly consider, the learning of Languages cannot better the Reason of any man, much less beget Understanding, except historical, which in Physick can be of no ser∣vice at all in this our Age: because Diseases are now changed and complicated, and few or none apparently single (as we said) and the Constitutions of Bodies so al∣tered, as whatsoever might formerly be of use, and very beneficial, at this Day is so far from doing Good, as 'tis often found to prove inimical and injurious, for the Reasons aforesaid. Indeed, it is clear to all Practitioners in Physisk, that are not Lip-learned only, that very few Sick Persons have been so happy as to suffer the Affliction singly of any Nominal Disease, ever since the Pox and Scurvey have proved so Epidemical; and the last Plague augmented the latter, as becoming material therein, that that Dis∣ease seemeth as the Mother or Genetress of all Calamities now reigning; insomuch that the Stone, Gots Pasies, and all the Troop of Diseases (congealing, coagulating and obstracting receive Life and Existance therefrom; against which no known Ancient: Remedies prevail, or effect ought to purpose, Nor did any Methodist ever care by them in these latter Days, notwithstanding the Advantage they have of Association, and standing so fair in the Opinions of the People, that they have Pa∣tients at their Bck so as at the very first beginning of Distempers 'ere those Diseases have materiated themselves, they are the Subjects of their Skill: An Advantage that those that are not of them seldom have: yet 'tis evident, that in Chronical Diseases more are cur'd by Particular Persons of no Society (when the Patients are by the other lest off as Uncurable, & the Disease for the most part changed in respect of its Seat; and the Spirit more darkned, through great Deility of the Faculties) then they themselves, with all the Helps of Nature's Clearness, Strength of Facul∣ties and Unfixedness of the Disease it self could alleviate or tolerably help. Now, since few of the Practitioners in Physick (that are not Collegiates or Depen∣ders
on them) follow any other Method, then what they have raised from Experi∣ence, or a well grounded Judgment in Nature, both as to the Progress of Distempers and the Cures thereof; is it not reasonable to judge, they are as fit (if not more to practise Physick, then Those that sit down contented with Rules prescribed by the Ancients, who knew nothing of the Distempers which now afflict, as is well and pithily noted by the Chymists of London in the first Part of their Principles stated &c. For 'tis evident by the Histories of former Times, Distempers were rarely compli∣cated, and now we are sensible; that they are seldom Simple; and how the Reme∣dies appointed by the Ancients in their Dayes should serve ours, We leave to the Judgment of every Man. Therefore it is worthy the Consideration of Magistrates and Others, that not withstanding there hath been, for many Years, this great Digression in Nature from her wonted Path, and Epidemical Diseases falling one upon the Neck of another have greatly augmented the same, yet hath it not been in the Hearts of these Men that are called a Colledge, either to take sufficient Notice of the same, or to  after Remedies for Prevention of the Increase thereof; whereas it is the Part of a good Physician, not only to change and alter his Medicines, but his Method of  also (if Need be) as Diseases vary and are changed; and whensoever any  his formerly succesful Remedies are unserviceable, to substitute others more effe∣ctual in their Stead, and this, not by Hearsay, or Reports of Others, but with found Judgment and proper Experience: But They, on the contrary, in all Times and Seasons have been so far from thinking this any Part of their Concern, that they have laboured to suppress those that have endeavoured it, as their Persecutions in all Times have testify'd. They are not ignorant of the Improvement that hath been made in Physick by those that are not of them (although Mr. Godale slanderously avers the contrary) in somuch that there is no single Labouring Physician, but hath something he can call his own, as a Blessing upon his Endeavour, whilest They, with all their Accumu∣lations (if they set aside what is bought, begged, or borrowed) are destitute  the Like, as they are a Colledge: For indeed Industry is alwayes followed with hopeful Fruits, but eness reapeth Nothing; yet we know they have their pri∣vate Nostrums (as they call their peculiar Remedies) but if compared with who Labouring Physicians profess they are but as Chass to Wheat and more for State the Service, and each of theirs for the most Part is such a Child as cannot call them Fa∣ther: Now can it be thought These Men, if left free to their pretended Power should ever advance Physick to the Benefit of their Country, when they so apparently hinder Others: For although for above an hundred Years they have had all the Ad∣vantages any Sort of People could desire, yet do they walk, like a Carrier's Horse▪  the old Track still; and this Curse they will hold (because splendid and profitable though almost every One of them, taken apart, will confess there is a Better Way but because those they have assumed for Patrons have not prescribed it. They rather choose to stumble and fall, and make Others do so too, then to leave the same;
Piece of Confidence, which (in any other Sort of Men) could not but be accounted Sordid; yet so strangely are these Men bewitched with the Pretence of Power, that They think, if they Kill by a prescribed Rule (like the Wild-Irish ploughing by the Horse-Tail) to be more pardonable then Others that are none of them, who really Cure without that Rule; but this is a Part of Boldness, so inconsistant with Inge∣nuity, that any unbyassed Man would be apt to judge them clear of the same; there∣fore since they are notoriously guilty thereof, it is a Thing very fit to be considered. For if they were by Act of Parliament made a Society, that was for the Advance∣ment (not the Hindrance of Improvement) of Physick; and if they have not advan∣ced, but hindred it, are they not, ipso facto, as other men that never had any such Authority? For where the Reason for which a Law was made ceaseth, the Law it self ceaseth to be: And can any man judge they were established a Colledge, for any other End, then the Cure of the Sick, after an easier and safer Manner then Others could do? and if they have not done it, shall Those that have done what They have not (or cannot do) be counted Aggressor? The Laws of the Kingdom, that admit, every Man's House as his Castle, for a Just Defence of his Propriety; and judge every Man or Men a Felon or Felons that break it open; yet in the Case of Fire do not in the least accuse Those, that for Preservation of the same House, and Defence of others, force open the Doors to quench it: Nor is the restraining of Mad or Passionate Men from injuring Others or themselves, either by locking a Door upon them, or holding their Hands, adjudged a Restraint of Personal Liberty (though in other Cases pu∣nishable by Law) because 'tis a Maxim in our Law, that all Laws are made for the Benefit, not the Hurt of the People in general: Therefore it hath been established by the Grand Charter, and since confirmed by many Parliaments, that if any Act be made contrary thereunto, it shall be holden for Null: Nor want there Examples for Proof of the same, as is well known to All that are acquainted with our own Histories; for the End of all Laws is no other, but the Preservation either of our Persons or our Estates; and so far as this Law doth so, it is to be acknowledged and adjudged Good. But can Any be so ignorant as to think, that if these Men could obtain their de∣sirable Power (which they earnestly attempted to acquire from the Parliament in the Year 1664. and seem now again to thirst after) it should be for the Preservation of Persons, or Security of Estates, when by Suppression of the Laborious and Inge∣nuous Party, they should arrogate and assume to themselves the sole Power of Ad∣ministring; shall not the Remedies so many Thousands have experienced the Use of, and the Advantages they have found by them be utterly extinct, and their Persons endangered for Want of them, and their Purses be exposed to the Pleasure of those they must be compelled to make Use of, who being but a small Number (and in a joynt Confederacy) may set what Price they please on their Visits? For without Doubt, where there is One Colledgiate Practitioner, there are three or four Others; and if the Number of People be considered in London and seven Miles about, it will be found that they of the Colledge are not capable (if the Non-Colledgiates, practi∣zing
Apothecaries and Chyrurgions were supprest) to supply the Necessities of half the Sick; suppose there were five hundred of them, which it is well known they are not, what is that to take Care of ten hundred Thousand Persons? But if it were so, that they were numerous enough, and as well furnised with Remedies, we see no Reason why any Man should be debarred of his Liberty so, as not to choose whom he pleaseth for his Physician, seeing it is one of the greatest Helps a Sick Person hath to be satisfied with those about him: And should we well weigh what it is to be debarr'd of using what Physitian we please in Time of Sickness, it would amount to no less then the Greatest of Cruelty; for the Husband must be forced to abandon the Relief of his Wife, when Sick, if under such a Distemper as their Remedies (which we too en find uncapable) cannot reach, and the Wife also must do the same to her Husband, the Father or Mother to their Children, and the Children to their Parents which if so, are not the Duties of Relations dissolved, and the Law of GOD (im∣planted in our Hearts, blotted out? And is not this an Impiety beyond Parallel. For of how great an Advance the Affection of a Patient to his Physician is towards his Recovery, none will doubt; but if the Sick Man shall be compelled to use that Physician he affects not, what great Consternations, Doubtings and Trouble of Mind (to the uter undoing of the Patient) will unavoidably thence arise in him every Man of a mean Capacity may easily judge. Besides, in Times of greatest Danger, as when the Plague raged, We have seen how inhumanely they fled the City, leaving its Inhabitants at that Time, when their Skill (if they had any) was of most Use; hence you may clearly see whe∣ther it be for the Benefit of the People to be compelled to use no other Physicians, then those who in Time of greatest Danger will be sure to forsake them: But I sup∣pose every Rational Man will judge this enough to prove they have forfeited their Power, having broken their Trust, which was for better securing the People from the Hands of the Ignorant. Now to conclude this Apology let us consider the Preamble of their Patent, the main Hinge or Soul of their Constitution, which (if perused) you will find clearly to demonstrate, that to prevent the Ignorant, Malicious and wicked from hurting the People, their Authority took Beginning, and was imposed on them for the same End wherefore, if They cannot prove Ignorance, Malice and Wickedness in the Per∣sons they trouble, can any Conscientious Jury-man find them guilty of a Law (if it be one) that have not deviated from the Scope and End thereof; let this be laid to Heart; also let it be well weighed, that They use not against us the Verity of their Arts, but Arms, viz. their pretended Law, as if they wanted other Arguments to confute Us; a sufficient Testimony They rather seek to suppress the Industrious by Pow∣er, then Reason; which if so, let all Men consider how safe they are under their Hands, and also, that Men of Innocency and Prudence seek not coercive Power over Others, but leave all Men to be Judges of their Acts, and are willing to stand or fall by the Common Law of the Kingdom, which never wants Power to chastize Those that by Male-Practice injure their Neighbours. FINIS.
