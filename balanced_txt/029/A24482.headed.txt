An Alphabetical Prophesie found in Dubline, in the year 1689, keeped secret then, because of the hight of Popery. Shewing what should fall out in 1692. THese Letters five P. R. J. W. and L. Together strive which of them shall prevail, P. claims pre eminencie over R. J. L. and W. For I. and R. makes all the World ado: P. pull'd down shall be: but R. shall rise, J. L. shall fall, and W. shall gain the prise; A. ante M. shall then hold E. his staff, And keep at under S. G. J. and F. D then shall dance, and G. shall glorifie, And B. shall boast of this great Victorie; N. after all recover shall the day, And O. his Banner valiantly display; No wapon traimd 'gainst Z, prosper shall, Thô other Nations they keep under thrall. Therefore, good People strive, yea, strive I say, For that Above, which never will decay. Note, All Letters here, except Z. and W. Are those, the Irish Characters allow, And when they do admit them with the rest, Then may the Land again be at the best. For the Readers better understanding the Author has set down the Denotation of these Letters. P. Popery, R. Reformed Religion, J. James, L. Lewis, W. William, I. and R. in the fourth line, In∣terest and Religion, A. ante M. Anti Monarchy, or State Government, E. Europe, S. Spaine, T. Turkey, C. Cham of Tartery, F. France, D. Denmark, G.
