AN ANSWER TO Several LETTERS Written by SCOTISH GENTLEMEN In His Majesties Dominions beyond the Seas, To the MASTER & GOVERNORS OF THE Scotish Corporation AND HOSPITAL in LONDON. Giving a true Account of the Erection of the said Company, and its Progress from the Year 1664, to 1677. for the Satisfaction of such as desire that Information. GENTLEMEN, WE cannot but judge well of your Intentions, by the desire you testifie in your Letters, to be in∣formed of the Grounds and Motives that in∣duced us to procure the Erection of a Corpo∣ration of our Countreymen in London: And as we rejoyce to perceive you acted by the same Charitable and Publick Spirit that mo∣ved us, so we think it our Duty to satisfie your just Demands as clearly and succinctly as pos∣sibly we can. Though we need not put you in mind that many use∣ful
and great Works have had their Rise from low and fortuitous Be∣ginnings; your own, and the experience of the World, being suffi∣ciently furnished with many Instances of this Nature; yet that you may the more fully understand the Original and Progress of our So∣ciety, by the accidental Motives and real Causes of its Establishment: take the pains, Gentlemen, to be informed, That in the Year 1664, a worthy Member of this Society, who is still alive, being visited with a long Fit of Sickness, and in doubt of Life, resolved to communicate to the Poor of his Countrey (whom he found to be numerous, and under great streights) part of the Fruits of those his Labors, which the Lord had been pleased to bless with Suc∣cess. But his Charity having a farther Prospect than a present Supply to the Indigent at that time, and being willing to mortifie a Gift, that might be a standing Stock for the Relief of the Poor not only of the present but future Ages; and to secure the same to Posterity, as far as worldly Contingencies could permit, and beyond the uncertainties of private Trustees, whose malversation or decay, often disappoint the pious Intentions of Donors; he took thereupon the advice of Councel. Their Answer and Resolution was, that his present Charity might be safely enough distributed, but that if his intention was to settle a perpetual Stock, the use and improvement whereof might be a stand∣ing Supply for the Poor of his Countrey, the surest Expedient for that was to obtain Letters Patent from His Majesty, for the erecting of an Incorporation of Scots in London which having the Priviledges of a permanent and authorized Society, would be by Law impowred to act and oblige themselves and Successors, in such a manner as no private Consociation could pretend to. This Resolution was immediately imparted by the Sick Person to the most sober and discreet Men of our Countrey, who then had the direction of that voluntary Contri∣bution, which by the name of Box-money was collected for the use of the Poor. They maturely weighed the matter first privately among themselves, and then in a general Meeting of our Countreymen, who all foreseeing the advantages of the Design, and applauding the Coun∣cel, notwithstanding their doubts of procuring the Patent, bestir∣red themselves so zealously in that Affair, that having made application to the Earl of Lauderdale, and made appear to him the profitableness of that Project, they obtained of His Gracious Majesty, by the intercession of the Earl, after a Reference and satisfactory Report made to His Ma∣jesty on that Subject, a Patent in ample Form; which took place the Third of September 1665. and Mr. James Kinnier was chosen first Master. So good a Work was almost stifled in the Birth; for the Contagious Plague which then dispeopled London, and those fatal Flames (which the Year following by the deplorable ruine of the City purified it from Infection to the very foundation;) if not wholly crushed, yet suspended for some time the execution of our good Intentions. These
dismal Times, however, put not a stop to the main Wheel of Charity, for during the Sickness Year, when our Beginnings were but small, there were Three hundred Scots, and of Scotish Extraction, who dyed of the Plague in and about London, buried at the Charge of the Com∣pany, with as much decency as the Calamity of the Time would per∣mit; and many who were Infected maintained, and taken care of, un∣til they recovered, and by God's blessing the Contagion ceased, with∣out putting the several Parishes where they had lived to one Farthing of Expences. Whil'st the City lay buried under its own Rubbish, though many of our Members who had been scattered by these two heavy Visitations, were again returned, and as earnest in their desires as formerly to pro∣mote that Work of Charity; yet the lowness of our Stock, which was hardly sufficient to supply the Necessities of the Poor that then lay upon us, made us almost despair of bringing our designs to any accom∣plishment. We wanted a Hall for our Meetings, Ground to build up∣on, and Money to purchase and effectuate both. Nevertheless in the Year 1670, the City having to admiration recovered, or rather out∣done much of its ancient splendor, we resolved with revived hopes vi∣gorously to set upon the performance of our long intended resoluti∣ons. To that effect having several times assembled the Body of our Company, to consult about the measures we were to take, we at length had notice given us of a piece of waste Ground in Black-Fryers, where formerly had stood a large dwelling House belonging to a Lady: ha∣ving after a view found the Ground for our purpose, we made appli∣cation to the Lady for the Purchase. She was unwilling to sell the Ground right of her Inheritance, but being informed of the Pious and Charitable use that it was designed for, she frankly granted us a Lease of it for a Thousand Years. Having laid this foundation, we again in several Meetings of the Corporation considered of the wayes of raising Money to go on with our Buildings; and found so great readiness not only in the Members of our own Society, but also in several persons of worth and quality of our Nation, who liberally and bountifully both gave and lent us Money, upon no other Security but the Bond of the Corporation, that we were enabled in several Gradations to build, first four dwelling Houses fronting the Street in Black-Fryers that leads to the River, with an Inscription on the Frontispiece, declaring them to be for the use of the Poor of our Countrey, which were finished in the Year 1671, next our Hall, and a House contiguous to it, the Hall having its Entry from the Street in Black-Fryers, and lying open to Bridewell Ditch, with an Emblem of Charity cut in Free Stone, and fastened in the Wall, finished in the Year 1672. And lastly another House which stands upon a parcel of disputed Ground that lay long undetermined, with a Kitchin and two Rooms over it for a Dwelling-house for our Beadle, which at the sole Charge of the Members of the Company were finished in the Years 1675, and 76. The Charge of the whole Building, viz. Seven Dwelling-houses, the Hall with two small Rooms adjoining to it, the Kitchin and two Rooms over it for the Beadle, by a true Computation, amounting to Four thousand four
hundred, and about fifty Pounds English, no inconsiderable Sum to have been raised and disbursed in so short a time. And though the Corporation hath by such a vast Expence contracted Debts; yet when we consider the chearful and free Contributions of those who have al∣ready concurred with so much Unanimity in that charitable Work, and the former experiences that we have had of the Goodness and Bles∣sing of Almighty God, in raising us up many times unexpected Supports to our languishing Hopes; we cannot but confidently believe, that the like means may hereafter free us from Incumbrances, as have hitherto advanced the Work in such a progress to perfection: And the rather, that none of those bountiful Benefactors who have even above their Abilities contributed to the Work, have any reason from the success of their honest Endeavors, to think their worldly Estates any way lessened thereby; God Almighty, who charges as a Debt on Provi∣dence what is chearfully given to the Poor, having many times imper∣ceptible wayes to repay what that way is lent to himself: And that moreover all such whose hands have been open in their Charity, besides the inward satisfaction of Conscience, the inseparable Companion of Virtue, and the hopes of future Bliss, the promised Reward of Well-doing, have also their Names and Benevolences recorded to Posterity in a large Sheet of Parchment hung up in the Hall, for their present sa∣tisfaction, and an encouragement to others hereafter to imitate their laudable Example. God Almighty having thus far prospered our Endeavors, we thought it convenient to have our Patent, which in some things was defective, and not rightly conceived, altered and enlarged. Accordingly having addressed our selves to his Grace the Duke of Lauderdale, the Kings Most Excellent Majesty, at the earnest desire of the Duke, has been Graciously pleased, to renew our Patent in such full and ample form as was requisite: And the Lord Chancellor of England, and other Offi∣cers of State through whose hands it past, have with a Generous and Charitable Liberality been pleased to discharge us of their usual Fees; to whose Noble Munificence we do acknowledge our selves Eternally obliged. Nor must we profess less Gratitude to the Magistrates and Governors of this famous City of London, who have not been wanting to encourage us by many Favors, and to many other Charitable Per∣sons of the English Nation, who professing themselves much taken with so laudable a work of Charity, have freely and bountifully assisted us with their Benevolence, which we hope will not be frustrated of Re∣ward. Hitherto, Gentlemen, we have acquainted you with the Motives that gave Being to our Corporation, and with its Beginnings and Pro∣gress to this present: We shall now briefly give you an Account of its Constitution and Government, with some few Instances, amongst many others, of the Benefits and Advantages that may therefrom redound to the Poor of our Countrey. The Corporation consists then, of a Master, Eight Governors, Three
nd thirty Assistants, with some subservient Officers appointed by them, s Register, Treasurer, Stewards and Beadle, and of entered Members. The Master is yearly chosen out of the Assistants by the eight Gover∣ors, who are perpetual, and must be all Scotish men born. If the Master dye before his Year be expired, the eldest Master is to supply his lace until a new Election: And upon death, or exclusion for misde∣eanor, of any of the Governors, the eldest Master amongst the As∣stants, provided he be a Scotish man born, is to succeed in the Office; ut if otherwise, he is only after he hath been Master, to continue As∣stant, and the next Scotish man successively of the Assistants that hath een Master, is to be admitted, according to the true and genuine sense nd meaning of our Patent. Out of the Assistants, by the Master, overnors and Assistants, there is likewise yearly chosen a Treasurer, ho in course falls to be Master: and who, to prevent all fraud and alversation, by suffering the Money to be in several hands, is alone to eceive the Companies Rents, which are collected by two Stewards al∣red and of new elected every Quarter-day; and at the Years end is  give in his Accompts at a Publick Meeting, which being audited and st the Balance, is to be delivered to the succeeding Treasurer for the llowing Year: so that the increase or diminution of the Publick ock, is punctually and publickly known every Year. It is to be observed that in all Meetings concerning the Affairs of the orporation, whatsoever is spent is not charged upon the Publick ock, but every one freely and without grudging pays his proportion, ough most have already considerably contributed to the Founda∣on. Now as to the Advantages which the Poor may receive by this Cor∣oration so constituted, they are many; for Lands may be either pur∣hased in the Name of the Corporation, or made over to them in trust, o be managed and improved for the use of the Poor, with far more curity than can be expected from any private Trustees who are not iected in a lawful permanent Body. Legacies and Donations, of hat nature soever, tending to the benefit of the Poor, may likewise e made over to the Company; whereby the Necessitous of our Coun∣ey who are here decayed and aged, may, by way of Pension, be sup∣ied, such as fall Sick relieved and taken care of, such as dye, decently ried, and such as want Money to go to their Native Countrey, fur∣shed; (Instances of all which we daily meet with in abundance:) ithout Burden to the Parishes where they live, Charges to Strangers mongst whom they have been, and Disparagement to the Countrey to hich they belong; and this we think a Consideration to be valued y all the ingenuous Lovers of their Countrey. We are likewise by ur Patent enabled to be serviceable to our Countreymen beyond a, in performing the Wills of the Dead as Executors, and distribu∣ng their Legacies amongst their Friends as they shall appoint, or in ispensing the Charity of the Living, in the manner that themselves hall prescribe, without fraud or prevarication, the nature of our Con∣titution made up of so many Persons whose private Interests are so
various, and their publick so uniform, in no probability being like  admit of any. Many other Benefits you your selves may gather fro the Privileges of such an Incorporated Body, which we shall not, present, to your farther trouble enumerate. To conclude, Gentlemen, we are fully persuaded that your own ca¦did Reflections upon what we have above intimated to you, will  only incline you to approve our charitable performances in this kin but also encourage you to assist us with your Counsels, and benevol Concurrence in a Work of so much advantage to the Indigent of  Countrey; it being not only a Christian duty, but in some manner so the Interest of all Men, especially such as are abroad, to exerc their Charity in this way; for whosoever shall but consult his own ¦perience as to the ebbings and flowings of Temporal Goods, and t many Revolutions of Providence, though Prosperity, at present, n seem with a smile to invite his Soul to take its rest, shall have reas without a blush or shame, to think it not altogether impossible, but t (if not) himself, yet some of his Relations who are dear to him,  at some time or other be obliged to that wherewith at present his C¦rity is pleased to oblige others. Though this be a Truth which uncertainty of worldly Enjoyments does too often confirm, yet as our Duty to wish well to all Men in General, so particularly we p God that he would be pleased more and more so to prosper you in  World, that you may have occasion to be fully satisfied with your  Portion, and abundantly to supply the Necessities of others; an grant you in the next the lot of the Righteous, and the rewar Well-doers: This is the hearty and earnest wish of, GENTLEMEN, Your affectionate Brethren and Countreymen, JOHN RENNEY present M FINIS.
