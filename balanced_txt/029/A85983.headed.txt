The Heathen or false Christians, yea rather the Divels Chri∣stians in Germany, have indevoured to doe the same unto God in the Heavens, and his servant David, whom God in this present and last time hath raised heere on Earth for the honour of his ho∣ly name, and for the Truth and eternall Righteousnesse of God; which the Jewes did formerly unto their King: whereupon they in many Countries have so fared for a great while, that the one hath beene forced to devour the other, far worse then in the de∣struction of Jerusalem. But the remnant which yet spurn against God, persevering still in their obstinacy and contempt of God, and thinking to be hidden from the eyes of the Majesty of God, never so much as endevouring to put out of their hearts and con∣sciences their vaine devices, their sinnes, their unbeliefe, and un∣righteousnesse, which formerly was crept in, nor any wayes wil∣ling to give any outward ayd and assistance, that this ruine, accor∣ding to righteousnesse may be removed, that remnant, I say, shall Gen. 6. 7. 19.

Ye are the Officers of my Kingdome, saith God, who giveth life and breath to every man: but those Gods who have not made Heaven and Earth, who are become vaine in their imaginations, detaining the truth in unrighteousnesse, nay all Heathens or king∣domes, who will not serve God, or helpe thereto, that Zion may be built, the poor and fatherles delivered, the miserable and needy ones obtaine justice, the afflicted and distressed rescued and freed from the violence of the wicked, or hands of the oppressors; those, I say, shall perish and be rooted out from the Earth, and from un∣der the Heavens, Jerem. 10.

Esa. 63.) and fierce wrath of God, Rom. 1. and his vengeance and judgement, 2. Thess. 1. shall not onely in one respect alone, but double and treble fall upon those mockers and despisers, who blaspheme the right of the Lord, and pervert all what is upright, going about to build Zion with blood, Mich. 3. Amos 5. James 5. Marke 12.and Jerusalem with unrighteousnesse, robbing the poore of his sweat and blood, and bringing thereby him, viz. their own Land and their subjects therein, into totall ruine and destruction; and moreover suffer their neighbors or fellow-members, who, accor∣ding 1 Cor. 13. Rev. 17. 18. Dan. 12. 1 John 3.to the justice and judgemet of God, might, could and ought to have been delivered, with body and soule, to perish. Therefore this Cains-generation had best to observe well this power, com∣mandement and message of God, not onely according to this, but also many other and former writings sent thither, in the behalfe Mich. 3.

But these Heathen who brag of Christianity, and yet most ob∣stinately and presumptuously will be counted the Only people of God, are in their hearts and consciences so possessed and blinded by the Prince of this World▪ viz the spirit of Eternall darknesse, that they are altogether unmindfull and carelesse of the Eternall, Infinite and Invisible God; nay, they wil not so much as acknow∣ledge Him amongst them, in the vaine and cursed Doctrine of those false Teachers, whom they have chosen to themselves, nor according to the power and truth of his Living Word, in regard of these present workes and deeds. Seeing that God in his Word long since faithfully enough, hath given warning, carefully to take heed and to beware of the false Prophets, viz. of those horrible ravening Wolves in sheeps clothing, who, with their contentious pratings and disputing, are the very prime and principall cause of all division, distraction, concision, confusion and seduction, Esa 3. and 10. chap. Ezech. 13. God speakes in his Word that the true believers being Mem∣bers of his Body, ought to be compacted, built and rooted toge∣ther, through the Bond of Peace, and the Love of God. But the Divell, through the mouth of the false Prophets in the stone-Churches and Chappels, or carnall Congregations, saith; Heere is Christ, there is Christ: Heer is the Temple of the Lord, heere is the Temple of the Lord: Come hither and heare us, and let your sinnes bee forgiven you, &c. and all this to that people which hath lost and forsaken Christ the Head of the Church and Saviour of his Body, according to his Eternall, Divine and Undi∣visible Power and Vertue. Now although God (richly and) abundantly hath warned the Heathen as well as the Jewish Nation, not to be haughty & proud in their unbeliefe; yet notwithstanding they being in and through all Cities and Countreyes, yea through all Realmes, as Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Holland and other places divided one from a∣nother

Zeph 3 in the very abisse or depth of their soules, or having no spi∣rituall communion of God any more amongst them; they, I ay, dreame and imagine to have a way to the Father into the e∣verlasting Kingdome of God, without Christ the unity in the Spi∣rit, or foundation of Faith, by the damned arch-witchcraft of their false Teachers, Priests, and Prophets, being never either sent or knowne of God, as if they with those false Apostles, by which Satan the very Divell transformeth himselfe into an Angel of light, had the truth, and God should be their liar, who long since hath foretold the state and condition of this present, last, and lamentable time, viz. that Faith should be extinguished, love by many grow cold, and unrighteousnesse get the upper hand. But seeing that these people wholly neglect and despise the Lord of Sabbath concerning the reall and fundamentall alterati∣on and removing of this present distresse, misery and great cala∣mity, for his seeds sake; and moreover that they for to main∣taine the Idolatry and Sorcery of their false worship and religion, wherein is neither faithfulnesse nor love, neither Faith nor Righ∣teousnesse, like the Jewes in former times, especially about the end of the old Testament, have begunne and still doe beginne one murthering, robbing, and bloodsheding course and enterprise, af∣ter and above another, not forbearing thus to bring many thou∣sands of souls to the slaughter, it shall & must so be paied home to these heathens possessed of the Divell, who never would obey nor hearken, but with all their strength still doe endeavour to annihi∣late and frustrate the counsell of the Lord; even so I say, as they have deserved it both of God himselfe, and also of those poore people, who thereby are ruined, made desolate and destroyed, Psal. 2. and 12. Thus the Heathen, viz. the people of the second and new Te∣stament, who, by breaking the bond of the love of God, are di∣vided asunder, and in Christ the light of Faith, blinded, are from the face and presence of Jesus Christ in these their darke and ob∣scure hearts called upon by Michael the Prince of warres, by whom the Lord God, for to maintaine the honour of his word and holy name, and for the fundamentall deliverance of poore Mankinde shall arise, and make himselfe manifest and knowne.
