A MANIFESTATION OF Divine Love, OR Some spirituall Breathings, consisting of two Generall Epistles, directed in Manuscript to the Flock of God in the West of England. Where they were read to the great refreshment of many, and now out of a sincere desire that Friends in all parts of this Nation (and others) may partici∣pate of that unfeigned love herein manifested, these things are made publick by a Mem∣ber of the Church of the first Borne. W. H. Arise, Shine for your light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is risen upon you: Your Sun shall no more goe down, neither shall the Moone be hid, for the Lord shall be your everlasting Light, and the dayes of your mourning shall be ended, Isa. 60. LONDON; Printed for Thomas Simmons at the signe of the Bull and Mouth within Aldersgate, 1660.
A Generall Epistle to all Friends, and a Sa∣lutation to the Saints, separated from the World; with a word of Exhortation to the Church of the first borne, in Sum∣merset-shire, Devon, Plymouth, Corn∣wall, and else where, in the West of Eng∣land. EVerlastingly beloved Friends, in the Truth of God, and faithfull Followers of the Lamb, in the Regeneration, who are asking the way to Sion, with your faces thitherwards; unto you all as one, who are of one mind and of an upright heart, is my love freely given, and dearly remembred, and for you is my soul poured forth into the bosome of my Father, and your Father, that by the eternall word of his power, you may be kept unspotted of the World, faithfull unto him who hath alled and chosen you, till you come to the end of your faith, that in the Kingdome which cannot be shaken, you may sit down, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, be∣ing heirs of the same inheritance, and partakers of the like precious faith, for which we earnestly con∣tend, in these last dayes, with respect to that re∣compence of reward, which is appointed of the Father, for the Seed, which he hath blessed.
Oh my Deare, and eternall beloved Friends, and fellow Citizens, a people saved by the Lord; and known to him, of all the families of the earth, who is like unto you? how amiable is your habitation, and how pleasant is your dwelling place? how delightfull is it to meet with you in the Taberna∣cle which God hath pitched amongst you, even as Lillies among Thornes, are you set before me, who are found walking in the truth, and faithfull to the Lord, and as fruitfull Trees, among the Trees of the Forrest, faire, and fresh, greene, and lively; yea verily in the light of life doe I behold you, in the beloved, as vessels of honour, sanctified, and made meet for the Masters use, although you were taken out of the same Lump, and hewed from the same Rock, and of the same earth, bloud, and off∣spring, that they are of, who yet remaine vessels of wrath, in the unconverted estate, separated from the Lord as reprobate Silver. Surely, the Lord whom you have sought, and for whom you have waited, hath done great things for you, yea, mighty things hath his right hand brought to passe, amongst you, glory to his name for evermore: My beloved and longed for in the Lord, let the high, holy, and honourable call of God, which hath reached unto you be answer∣ed by you, with pure obedience, and his loving kindnesse with faithfullnesse, let his manifold mer∣cies be had in an everlasting remembrance, and declare his noble Acts unto your children, that they may tell it to another Generation, that so in Ages to come, you may manifestly be declared to
be a chosen generation, an holy nation, a peculiar people, saved by the Lord, and sanctified by him, through the operation of his good Spirit, which was manifested unto you, and received by you, through the hearing of faith. And Friends, in as much as you have many dayes and months past, in∣quired for the new and living way, and now in an acceptable time, as an answer to your earnest ex∣pectation, the Lord hath administred an entrance into it, let his free love constraine you all to walk in it as obedient children, that your light may shine forth as the light of seaven dayes, to the a∣stonishment of the adversaries of the Lord, and the stopping of all slanderous mouthes, whose pra∣ctise is to blaspheme God, and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven; for the Lord is risen in glory, and in great Majesty, to shake all Nations, and to staine the glory of all flesh, to assemble the outcasts of Israel, to comfort the mourners in Sion, and to proclaime liberty to the Captives, who hath shewed you the path of life, and guided your feet into the way of peace, who is giving beautifull garments instead of ashes, even the garment of praise, for the spirit of heavinesse; yea, I bear you record, your light is come, and the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, is arising among you, and upon you, in the day of the visitation of his ever∣lasting love; and this one thing the Lord requires of you, that is, to obey his Voyce, and the way to manifest your obedience, is to walk humbly with him, in a holy life, and in a chast conversation, in your place and callings, according to your measure
of the free gift of God communicated unto you, and manifested in you to profit withall; and that you may be filled, with the spirit of wisdome, and furnished with the heavenly treasure, unto every good word and worke, my hearts desire and pray∣er for you all is that, Grace, Mercy, Truth, eter∣nall Love, everlasting Righteousnesse; and perfect Peace, may be abundantly multiplyed, and increa∣sed in you, and among you all, that you may be made compleat in him, who is the head of the spi∣rituall body, the Church or houshold of faith, which is builded of living stones, upon the foun∣dation of many Generations, for an habitation of God through the Spirit, that in you he may dwell, and be glorified, and over you he may rejoyce, as the operation and workmanship of his own hands, who is creating you againe in Christ Jesus unto good workes, which he hath before time ordained that we should walk in them. These things my Friends I write unto you, as moved of the Lord, for the stirring up of the pure mind in you, who knowes the truth and are made partakers of the pure and precious faith which was once delivered to the Saints; and hereby I doe as your servant for Christs sake, and in Christ stead, exhort and beseech you all to attend, and condes∣cend to the counsell of the Lord, directed unto you through him that hath loved and doth love you unfeignedly, as being not only neerly related, but also inseperably united unto you, as a member of the same body, whereof Christ Jesus is the head, in whose behalfe these necessary things are
brought before you, by way of remembrance, not as if you were ignorant of them, but because you know them already, and other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid; and if any beast or false prophet, out of the Sea, or out of the earth, nay if an Angell inlightened from Heaven, should bring any other doctrine, or preach any other Gos∣pel among you, then that which hath been freely preached, and by you received, in which you stand, let him be accursed, and receive none such into your houses, neither bid them God speed, least you partake with them in their evill deeds: And Beloved, believe not every spirit, for some deceitfull spirits may fall in among you, whose wickednesse is more spirituall, and their iniquity more malicious, then formerly hath appeared, though many of the like spirit, and principle, hath been denyed, and declared against, and turned away from, by some of you, that have known the Depthes and Wiles of Sathan, who letteth and will let untill he be taken out of the way, who is now revealed, and made manifest, that he may be destroyed, and cast out, as an Ac∣cuser of the Brethren, and an enemy of their peace. Truly Friends, My heart is inlarged towards you, and my love abounds to you, more then herein can be expressed, or contained, let me be read by you where I am written without hands, and let this be received, as the flowing forth of one streame from the Fountaine; In the fear of the Lord, I write unto you who are called to be Saints,
both to the Ancient, and Honourable, Male, and Female, in the houshould of Faith, in bonds, and at Liberty. Fathers and Mothers, in love, feare, wisdome, and moderation, rule, reprove, informe, instruct, correct, and counsell your Children, and according to their growth and knowledge in the truth, ad∣minister unto them, for their edification, and con∣firmation, and let not your own wills, or, a zeale, before true knowledge, usurp authority over them, because they are the fruit of your body, but look upon them who are begotten of God, and have received the truth, as upon the off-spring of God, and equall with you, as in that relation; and if they be such as have chosen the better part, and are made truly wise unto salvation, despise not their youth, but be ready to receive instruction, or information from them, as well as to administer to them; and if they be such as be out of the truth, provoke them not to wrath, but by all meanes pos∣sible, labour in wisdome and moderation, to pro∣voke them to love, and to good workes, that if peradventure you may be a means to gaine them, to the acknowledgment of the truth, in which you have believed, so will your renowne go forth amongst the Heathen round about, and the Lord will multiply and increase your off-spring, and cause them to break forth on the right hand and on the left, to build the old wast places, and to in∣herit the desolate heritages, and herein the Lord will be glorified in you, and by you, and if you abide faithfull to him, he will make you an eter∣nall
excellency, even the joy of many Genera∣tions, and Crowne you with the first dominion, who first beleeved in the truth, and whom God hath set as the first fruits of his creatures in this Generation. Likewise all ye Children of the Light, who have received the truth in the love of it, let Ho∣nour and Obedience, be manifested to your Pa∣rents in the Lord, and for his sake submit to them in things pertaining to this life, in singlenesse of heart, and receive their counsell with meeknesse of spirit, and readinesse of mind, when they speak according to the Word of God, and mind of Christ, that the precious Promises of God you may receive, both length of dayes, and peace in your dwellings, the blessing and presence of God, both in your going forth, and in your com∣ing in, so shall you be for ever established in the Truth, and everlasting Righteousnesse, and the Lord will give you a name in his house, and with∣in his Walls, better then that of Sons and Daughters, if you continue faithfull unto the end. And you that are Husbands love your Wives, who are joyned unto you, and given as meet helpes for you, and watch over them for good, to instruct, cherish, comfort, confirme, and esta∣blish them in the truth, that you may both come to be joyned, and everlastingly betrothed to one Head and Husband in the Spirit and in the Truth, that here your union may encrease, and your off∣spring may become holy to the Lord, who saw
that it was not good for man to be alone, and therefore gave him the help of another, who is no more two but one, being joyned in and by the Lord, which thing by some of you is witnessed, according to measure. And Wives submit your selves to your Hus∣bands, in the fear of the Lord, as head over you, to order, guide, and counsell, comfort, and direct, and in all wisdome, meeknesse, and moderation, as meet helps and faithfull yoak-fellowes, behave your selves towards them, so will you have praise of men, and favour with God; for the ornament of a meek spirit, is the garment of praises, and let your adorning be after the manner, and according to the example of the holy and honourable wo∣men, in the dayes of old, and this is a thing of good report, which may stand recorded for ages to come, that the children yet unborne may hear of your Renowne, and come to the brightnesse of your rising. Likewise you that are Masters of Servants, and Rulers in Families, be not hasty, nor high minded, but in the spirit of meeknesse, rule in love, and in the fear of God, in the authority of Christ, as his Servants, and not as Lords over Gods heritage, for he that rules amongst men, must be just, ruling in the fear and wisdome of God, and by this meanes the Lord will bow the spirits of your servants, in subjection to the power of God, when his Law and Government thus comes to be set up in you, to order and rule your houses well, so will the Lord honour you in the sight of men, and blesse you in all that you put your hands unto.
And let as many Servants, and handmaids as are under the yoak, be subject unto their own Masters, to whom they are related by any outward Cove∣nant, contract, or engagement whatsoever, serving them with a ready mind, in singlenesse of heart, not with respect to their persons as men pleasers, and eye servants, but as servants of Christ, and subject to men in the thing that is good, for his sake; And hereby will the Lord be honoured, and his Truth be spread abroad in the earth, so will his Doctrine be adorned, and your light will goe forth as the Morning, and your Salvation, as a Lampe that burneth. And all you Prisoners of hope, for the Testimo∣ny of Jesus, be still, and waite upon the Lord in patience, all the dayes of your appointed time, for the Lords love is unto you, and your cause is own∣ed by him, who will arise for your Redemption, and returne your Captivity, as the streains in the South, and plead with your adversaries face to face, for all the hard measure you have received from their hands, which are full of blood: I am as a companion with you to this day, as one bound with you, being a member of the same body which the Lord hath prepared to fulfill his will, both by doing, and suffering; And so unto the Protection of Israels keeper, I commit you all; and as a mani∣festation of the love of God, let these lines be re∣ceived, and read, amongst you, which are written in bowells of love and tendernesse, by your Friend in the Truth, and a servant unto you, for and in the behalf of Jesus Christ our Head. Thomas Salthouse.
To all who are Lovers of, and Believers in the true Light, Grace, Mercy, and everlasting Peace be multiplyed amongst you. DEare and precious souls, for as much as it hath pleased the infinite wise God, who is pure for ever, and just, and equall in all his wayes, who loves Truth and delights therein, who is strong, and mighty to deliver, and able to save from sin and Sathan, bondage, and corruption, all who comes unto him, and waites upon him, in truth and meeknesse, and sincerity of heart, who is the God of the spirits of all flesh, who gives life and breath unto all, who made the World and all things therein by his power, and by his Word which is powerfull upholds all things at this day and time, who is the same to day as ever, in Power and Majesty, his Arme is not shortned that it can∣not save, nor his Eye closed that it cannot see, neither is his Mouth shut that it cannot speak, but he lives, and workes, and speaks, and sees, and discernes what is contrived and acted among the Sons and Daughters of men; his living Word abides for ever, and is as quick, and as lively as
ever, as powerfull, and sharpe, for the cut∣ting downe of sin, and corruption, as it e∣ver was in the dayes of old and ages past, according to the Testimony of the holy men of God recorded in the Scriptures of truth, as the many living and true witnesses at this day doe likewise testifie, and set to their seales, that these things are true, though the darke World doe not see, whose eyes are closed, and eares stopped, and hearts harded, by reason of sin, that they cannot see, nor heare, nor rightly un∣derstand those things that are of the great∣est concernment, but notwithstanding the blindnesse, and ignorance, and the great darknesse which is over many thousands, so that they know not the Majesty, and sav∣ing power of God, but are laden with (and dayly adde sin upon sin) yet a Remnant there are who are quickened by the living Word, who beare Witnesse to the same saving, living, powerfull Truth, which makes free, and seales up in one Covenant of light, and life, all such as live in the power of it. Now seeing Dearly Beloved, that it hath pleased our gracious Almighty God, to ap∣peare in these last times according to his pro∣mise declared by his holy Prophets, concern∣ing his great love in pouring forth of his holy Spirit upon his people, and to gather them from off the barren Mountains, and from the
mouths of the Wolves, and all false Shep∣heards, that they might no longer be made a prey upon, nor starved for want of bread, but the promise of God, is to feed them himself, in fresh and greene pastures, and bring them back into the fold of the good Shepheard, and there shall be one sheepfold, and one Shepheard. Dear hearts, both I, and you, and all the rest of the Sheep and La of Christ, may truly confesse, and say, that we all like Sheep that have gone astray, we were wan∣dring upon the dry and barren Mountaines, and feeding upon the huskes and empty shad∣dowes, even as well as others, but for ever∣more blessed and praised be the Lord our God, who in a good and an acceptable time, did appeare, and stretched forth his holy Arme, and gathered us into the fold of the good Shepheard, whereby we are refresh∣ed, with the favour, and tender loving kind∣nesse of the Lord; O what manner of love is this, that even when we were ene∣mies and Rebells against God, yet his eye was over us for good, and waited to be gra∣cious unto us, (as he doth now unto the World) not willing the death and destruction of any, but rather that all might turne unto him, and hearken to his Voyce that their souls might live. Deare Friends, as the Lord in his rich love hath visited you, and by his grace called you
out of darknesse into his marvelous light, so, deare ones, prize his love, and walke worthy of that high and heavenly calling whereunto the Lord hath called you, pleasing him in all things, waiting in the light which is pure, (which is of Christ) in you, that ye all may receive, wisdome, and counsell from God, that whatsoever ye doe or take in hand, may be done to the glory and praise of him, that hath called you. Remember and alwayes keep in mind the goodnesse of the Lord, and let his Word dwell and abide in you, lay it up in your hearts, as a precious and holy treasure, so will ye be kept in a lively sensible state, apt, and fit to receive instruction from the Lord; The living word seasons and keeps the heart sweet and savoury, so that corruption cannot grow there, neither any other lusts, or bad thing, but by the Word it is cut down and destroyed, blessed are they that keep the Word of God in them, such shall be kept in peace and unity, with God, in the light, and there every one shall see the honou∣rable calling unto which ye are called, he that calls is holy and honourable, and the calling unto which you are called is likewise holy and honourable, considering what ye are called from, and what ye are called unto, formerly ye walked in darknesse, and had fellowship with the unfruitfull workes of darknesse, now ye are called out of darknesse to walke in the light, and there to have communion one with
another, and fellowship with God, who is light, and with his son Jesus Christ, who likewise de∣clares himselfe to be the light of the world, in the light is the precious unity, with God, and with Christ, and one with another. If we walke in the light, (saith the beloved Disciple) as he is in the light, then (not till then) have we fellowship one with another, and the blood of Je∣sus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. They that love the light, and believe in the light, and walke in the light, such receive remission of sins, such worship God truly, such are of one heart, and of one mind, and soul, such only are accepted of the Lord, and with, and to such is my soul for ever united, and bound up in the Covenant of light, life, and peace: And unto you all who are lovers, and followers of the light, is my heart poured forth in love towards you. And now deare souls, as you have been called to such an high and heavenly calling, mind eve∣ry one your particular duties, in walking an∣swerable to the Lord in every thing, that good order may be kept amongst you, both in your meetings and solemne Assemblies, in your ser∣vice and Worship of God, and also in your com∣mon occasions and affaires amongst men; some∣thing is upon my spirit to write unto you at this time, concerning these two weighty things. And first, Concerning the Worship and Ser∣vice of God: That which God requires of eve∣ry
one, is Justice, Mercy, and a humble, and orderly conversation, for as it is the love of God by his light to shew you his will and mind, so it is your duties to doe the Will of God, which Will is your Sanctification, and as it was the manner and practice of the ho∣ly men of God, (who were called in the light) to meet together to waite upon God, and to speake one to another, as the Spirit of Truth did move and give them utterance, for the strengthening one another, and build∣ing up one another in the most holy faith; so it is now judged meet, and good, also use∣full and necessary, for all who are called to be Saints, to meet often together, to waite upon the Lord, that their strength may be renewed: So Friends, when ye come toge∣ther to waite upon God, come orderly in the feare of the Lord, the first that enters into the place of your meetings, be not care∣lesse, nor wander up and downe, either in body or mind, but innocently set downe in some place, and turne in thy mind to the light, and waite upon God singly, as if none were present but the Lord, and here thou art strong; then the next that comes in let them innocently and in sincerity of heart sit downe and turne into the same light, and waite in the Spirit, and then ye are stronger: One in the Truth is strong, two in the Truth is stronger then one, and so all the rest com∣ing in, in the feare of the Lord, sitting down
in pure stillnesse and silence, waiting in the light, a few that are thus gathered by the Arme of the Lord, into the unity of the Spi∣rit, this is a sweet and precious meeting, where all meet with the Lord, and being thus set waiting together, if any good thing move or stir in any it will be felt and heard throughout the whole meeting, if a pure sigh or groane, it will preach and draw inward to the watch, and so as all minds are stayed on the Lord in spirit, is refreshment to the soul, words which are precious, sweet and good; as the streame is sweet, so is the Foun∣taine, for if words be good (as it is confest by most sorts of people, and that to meet to∣gether to speake words is good, to edifie one another, but to meet in silence many doe not know what to think or make of it; Now I say that words in their place and season as they are spoken from the movings of love and life, are good and serviceable, but all words which are spoken in the Cu∣stome, and dead forme, though they be ne∣ver so good words, if they doe not spring and arise from the good word, they are vaine and unprofitable, but words spoken in and from the life and Spirit of God, are good and profitable for the stirring up of the pure mind, then if words be good) the Spirit from which good words are spoken must needs be better; so then those who are brought to a pure still waiting upon God in the Spirit,
are come more nearer to the Lord tben words are, for God is a Spirit, and in the Spirit is e worshipped, so that my soule hath deare union with you, who purely waite upon God in the Spirit, though never a word be spoken, to the hearing of the outward eare, yet in the spirit of love, I have unity with you, and here is the true feeding, in the spirit, and all who thus meet together to waite upon the Lord, shall renew their strength dayly, and in such a meeting where the presence and power of God is seen and felt, there will be an unwillingnesse to part asunder, being ready to say in your selves, it is good to be here, and this is the end of all words and writings, to bring people to the eternall liv∣ing Word. So all deare hearts, when ye come together to waite upon God, come sin∣gly, and purely, that your meeting may be for the better, and not for the worse. And if any be moved to speake words, waite low in the pure feare to know the mind of the Spirit, where, and to whom, they are to be spoken, for a multitude of words in one particular meeting, to one and the same peo∣ple, will burden the Seed, and bring dead∣nesse; therefore if any be moved to speak, see that they speak in the power, and when the power is still, be ye still, for in the house of God amongst the family there will be little need; But if thou hast skill, goe and cast thy net into the Sea, and gather as many as thou
canst, good and bad, out of the Sea, and they may be separated, the good from the bad afterwards. And all who speak of the moving of the Lord, I lay it as a charge upon you, to be∣ware of abusing the power of God, in acting a wrong thing under pretence of being moved of the Lord, for the pure power may move (and then the enemy who goeth about like a roaring Lion seeking whom he may devour, he presents a wrong thing to the view of the understanding, and here is danger of abu∣sing the power, acting that which the true power condemns, and yet pretends the power moves to it (and this is a double sin) as to bring forth a Bastard is a sin, but to father it upon an honest man who is not guilty of that sin, is a double sin; so to act any thing that the true power condemns is evill, but to father the evill upon the power is a dou∣ble evill.) Therefore let every one patiently waite, and not be hasty to run in the darke, but keep low in the true feare, that the un∣derstanding may be opened, to know the mind of the Spirit, and then as the spirit moves, and leads, it is good to follow its leadings, for such are lead into all Truth; and thus my Friends, as you keep close to the Lord, and to the guidance of his good Spirit, you shall not doe amisse, but in all your ser∣vices, and performances, in the Worship of God, ye shall be a good savour unto the Lord,
and the Lord will accept of your services, and blesse and honour your Assemblies, with his presence and power. And now for the ordering of your conver∣sations amongst men, ye are to walke by the same Rule, that is, when your meeting is end∣ed, doe not look upon the service of God to be ended, but keepe in the feare of God, that ye may receive Wisdome from God, to order the creatures, that the pure light may exercise your conscience towards God and men. A time there was at your first convincement, when ye stood in the crosse, to the worlds spirits, and could not conforme to their Cu∣stomes; many of them have stood off for a time, and would not Trade nor deale with Friends, but when they see your fidellity, and honesty, they come againe, and many have greater desires to deale with Friends, then many of their own Generation, because they know that ye will not wrong them, nor deale de∣ceitfully with them, and then the blessing of God attends the faithfull, and gives an in∣crease, both inward and outward, then is the danger of being lifted up in mind, or drawne backe againe into the earth, so that the earth comes over, that will choake, and hinder the growth of the Seed, but as every one keeps in the dominion and power of God, so that the earth is his footstool, then the blessing is con∣tinued, as love to the Truth is continued; and so deare Friends in all companies at all times
and seasons, so walke that ye may be exam∣ples of good unto all, and answer the Witness of God in all, that God over all may be glorifi∣ed, and you by his power daily kept and pre∣served in holinesse, and righteousnesse, out of the Worlds wickednesse, not for a day, or a weeke, or a certaine time only, but even all the dayes of your lives, for this is but just and rea∣sonable, that we should yield our members ser∣vants unto God, who gives us life and strength, and all other good things; glory, and holy praises be rendred unto him, of all that knows him, for evermore. And furthermore, Deare Friends, as concern∣ing these present overturnings, and these great destractions, devisions, and confusions, in this our Nation, be not ye troubled nor shaken in mind, because of these things, there is a secret hand working in and through all these over∣turnings; and they come to passe not without the knowledge of the Lord, for making way for greater things, which the Lord hath to bring to passe in this Nation, for much is yet to be throwne downe, before Truth and Righte∣ousnesse be set up: My advice and counsell is, that every one of you, who love and beleeve in the light, be still and quiet, and side not with any parties, but own and cherish the good where ever it appears, and testifie against the evill in all, where ever it appears, not like the children of this World, warring with car∣nall weapons against flesh and blood to destroy
mens lives, but like Christians, with spirituall weapons warring against spirituall wicked∣nesses, and against all sinfull and fleshly lusts, which warre against the soul, not striking at creatures but at the power, that captivates the creatures, that so the creatures may be redeem∣ed from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God; so be not ye overcome with evill, but overcome evill with good, so shall you have peace with God, and true unity with all who are of God; the God of power strengthen you in every good word and worke, and perfect his worke in you, to his glory, who is blessed for ever, Amen. Given forth the 14 day of the 11th Month, 1660. I Rest in the Lord, your deare Brother in the Truth, watching for all your good. Alexander Parker. FINIS.
