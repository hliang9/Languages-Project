SYDNEY, THO: CONINGESBY. WHereas there is good Reason to suspect, that several Dangerous Persons coming as Spies from the Rebels, and upon other wicked Designs, are shel∣tred in the City of Dublin, and the Liberties there∣of, in Taverns, Inns, Ale-houses, and Coffee-houses, kept by Natives of this Kingdom of the Popish Religion, which Houses are likewise fre∣quently made use of by such evil disposed Persons and others for their places of Meeting, to Contrive as much as in them lieth the Subversion of Their Majesties Government, and the Ruine of Their good Subjects of this Kingdom. We therefore ta∣king the same into Our Serious Consideration, have thought fit hereby to discharge all Persons, Natives of this Kingdom of the Popish Religion from selling any Wine, Ale, Beer, or other Liquors within the said City or Li∣berties thereof by Retail after the twenty fifth day of this present December. And We do hereby Will and Command all such Natives of this Kingdom, that after the said time, they nor any of them do not presume to use the Trade or Calling of a Vintner, Ale-house-keeper, Inn-keeper, or Coffee-seller, within the said City or Liberties thereof, upon pain to be proceeded a∣gainst as Retailers of Wine, Ale, Beer, Coffee, or other Liquors (without License) and Contemners of Their Majesties Authority.
