For the Encouragement therefore of the Officers of His Majesties Customs, and all other Persons whatsoever, to use their utmost Diligence and Endeavours to Discover and Seize all such Gold and Silver Coin, as shall be Exported or put on Board any Ship or Vessel in order to be Exported, or shall be in the Keeping of any Person passing out of this Realm; and that they may have the same share of such Coin, as shall be Seized or Dis∣covered by them, as by Law is given to the Persons who shall Seize or Discover any Bullion Exported contrary to Law: It is Ordered by their Excellencies in Council, That the Lords Commissioners of his Majesties Treasury do Grant and Allow to such Officer or other Person whatsoever, who shall Discover or Seize any Sum or Sums of the Gold and Silver Coin of this Kingdom, which shall be Ex∣ported, or put on Board any Ship or Vessel in order to be Exported, or shall be in the Keeping of any Person passing out of this Realm, one Moiety of such Gold or Silver which shall be so Seized or Discovered, as a Reward to such Per∣son for his Diligence, in making such Discovery or Seizure.
