An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, for the calling of an Assembly of Learned and Godly Divines. WHereas amongst the infinite blessings of Almighty God upon this Nation, none is, or can be more deare unto us then the purity of our Religion, and for that as yet many things remain in the Liturgy, Discipline, & Go∣vernment of the Church, which do necessarily require a further & more perfect Reformation, then as yet hath bin attai∣ned, and where it hath declared and resolved by the Lords & Com∣mons assembled in Parliament, That the present Church-govern¦ment by Arch-bishops, Bishops, their Chancellors, Commissaries, Deanes, Deanes & Chapters, Arch-deacons, & Ecclesiastical Offi∣cers depending upon the Hierarchy, is evill & justly offensive & bur∣thensome to the Kingdom, a great impediment to Reformation and growth of Religion, & very prejudiciall to the state & government o this Kingdome, and that therefore they are resolved that the same shall be taken away, & that such a government shall be setled in the Church, as may be most agreeable to Gods holy Word, and most apt to procure and preserve the peace of the Church at home, and neerer agreement with the Church of Scotland, and other re∣formed Churches abroad, and for the better effecting hereof, and for the vindicating and clearing of the Doctrine of the Church of England from all false calumnies and aspersions, it is thought fit and decessary to call an Assembly of Learned, Godly, and Iu∣dicious Divines, to consult and advise of such matters and things touching the premisses as shall be proposed unto them by both or either of the Houses of the Houses of Parliament, and to give their advice and counsell therein to both or either of the said Hou∣ses, when, and as often as they shall be thereunto required.
