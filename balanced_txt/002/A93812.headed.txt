THE STATE EMPERICK A New BALLAD. To the Tune of, Which no body can deny. [1] FRom over the Seas not long since there came, A Doctor of most Notorious Fame, If you please, you may guess at his Ʋn-Christian name. Which no body can deny. [2] This Doctor came hither to cure three Nations. Who were so Silly as to be his Patients; And first he Blooded 'em for the Fashions. Which, &c. [3] The Med'cine he brought was called a PLOT, Which was Compounded of th Devil knows what: When first he Arrivd it was Piping-Hot. Which, &c. [4] But if We may guess at the Damn'd Composition, 'Twas a mess of all sorts of English Sedition, Made by a Presbyterian Physician. Which, &c. [5] To make each Dose go down the safer, What do▪s me still This Learned Gaffer, But Cover it or with a Papist's Water. Which, &c [6] As soon as 'twas Swallow'd, the Patient began, To Stare and to Talk like a Lunatick Man, Of Pistols and Daggers, to Kill and Trepan. Which, &c. [7] To some 'twas Fmetick, to others Cathartick; (I mean, to all those who of it did partake;) In short, it made every Honest Mans heart-ake. Which, &c. [8] To say truth we were all in a filthy Condition, This voided a Libel, that Spew'd a Petition, For which we may thank in part our Physician. Which, &c. [9] At last it made our Bloud so ferment, That a Rancorous Sore from Men's Body's was sent: The Ʋlcer, I mean, of a strange Parliament. Which, &c. [10] It's Venom upon each Member was shed; The Body it almost had over-spread; Nay, it had e'en like to have seiz▪d on the Head. Which, &c. [11] But one wiser then all▪ did gvi't such a Thump, That t burst and went out, just next to the Rump, Which made with Joy ev'ry Loyal Heart Jump. Which, &c. [12] This Ʋlcer was full of Pistol and Sword, With Blunderbuss and with your things made of Board; Your Protestant Flayls to Fight for the Lord. Which, &c. [13] O Doctor! I fear, you study'd Art Magick, To Compass your Ends, which still were so Tragick: But now it is hop'd that we may lead You-a-Jig. Which, &c. [14] Or else I am sure, without being uncivil, A Man my believe you deal with the Devil, For no body else could have wrought us such Evil. Which, &c. [15] Your Canting was Charm, Rebellion your Witch, With these you gave the Poor Rabble the Itch, When like Emp'rick on Stage you made 'em a Speech. Which, &c. [16] Y'are Jilted you see by Faction your Whore, Your little Tap-Pug can help you no more: Hell ow's Both a Spite, and will pay ye the score. Which no body can deny.
