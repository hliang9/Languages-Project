A PREPARATORY PRAYER Before Sacramentall Confession. O Maker of heauen & earth, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, who hast made me of nothing vnto thy Image and si∣militude, & hast redee∣med me with thy owne pretious bloud, whome
I a sinner am not worthy to name, nor call vpon, nor yet to thinke of, in hart. I meekly beseech thee, and humbly pray thee, that thou wouldst respect with clemency me thy wicked seruant. And haue mercy vpon me, who tookest pitty vpon the woman of Ca∣naan, & Mary Magdalen: who spard'st the Publi∣can, and the Theefe hā∣ging vpon the Crosse.
To thee I confesse, O most louing Father, my sinnes, which, O Lord, if I would I cannot hide from thee. Spare me, o christ whom I haue late∣ly much offēded in thin∣king, speaking, and do∣ing, & by all the wayes in which I frayle worme and a sinner might of∣fend through my fault, through my fault, tho∣rogh my most grieuous fault. Therefore, O
Lord, I beseech thy Clemency, who camest downe from heauen for my saluation, who lif∣tedst vp Dauid from the fall of sinne, spare me o Lord, spare me o Christ who sparedst Peter de∣nying thee. Thou art my Creatour, and my Redeemer, my Lord, & my Sauiour, my King, and my God. Thou art my hope, and my trust, my stay, and my helpe,
my consolation, and my fortitude; my defence, and my deliuerance; my life, my saluation, and my resurrection; my light, and my desire; my ayde, & my patronage. I beseech and pray thee help me, and I shall be safe: gouerne me, and defend me; comfort, & consolate me; confirme and glad me; enlighten me, and visite me. Raise me being dead, because
I am thy creature and worke. O Lord, despise me not, for that I am thy seruant and vassall: and although euill, al∣though vnworthy and a sinner, yet such as I am, whether good or euill, alwayes I am thyne. Vn∣to whome shall I flye, except I go to thee? If thou cast me off, who will receaue me? If thou despise me, who wil be∣hold me? Re-acknow∣ledge
me therfore thogh vnworthy returning vn∣to thee. For if I am vi∣le, and vncleane, thou canst cleanse me: if I be blind, thou canst enligh∣ten me: if I be feeble, thou canst heale me if I be dead and burryed, thou canst reuiue me, because thy Mercy is greater then my iniqui∣ty: greater is thy piety, then my impiety: more thou canst pardon, then
I commit: & more thou canst forgiue, then I a sinner offend. Therfore o Lord despise me not, nor yet regard the mul∣titude of my iniquities, but according to the multitude of thy cōmi∣serations haue mercy on me, a most grieuous sin∣ner. Say to my soule, I am thy saluation; who saidst: I will not the death of a sinner, but ra∣ther that he be conuer∣ted
and liue: turne me, O Lord vnto thee, and do not extend thyne an∣ger against me. I beseech thee▪ o most clement Fa∣ther, for thy mercy, I bow downe and earnest∣ly pray thee, that thou direct me vnto a good end, and vnto true pen∣nance, pure confession, and worthy satisfaction, for al my sinnes. Amen.
Another Prayer before Sa∣cramentall Confession. REceaue my confessiō O most benigne, and most clement Lord Christ, the only hope of the saluatiō of my soule, and giue vnto me (I be∣seech thee) contrition of hart, and teares to myne eyes, that I may bewaile day and night all my negligences with humi∣lity and purity of hart.
Let my prayer o Lord, approach neere in thy sight. If thou shalt be angry against me, what helper may I seeke? who will haue mercy vpon myne iniquityes? Re¦member me, O Lord, who didst cal the womā of Canaan, and the Pu∣blican to repentance, & didst receaue Peter wee∣ping. O Lord my God, accept my prayers: O good Iesu, Sauior of the
world, who gauest thy selfe to the death of the crosse, that thou mightst saue sinners, regard me a wretched sinner, cal∣ling vpon thy Name, and regard not so my wickednes that thou for∣get thy goodnes. And if I haue committed ought, whereby thou mayst condemne me, yet thou hast not lost that whereby thou art wont to saue. Spare me there∣fore,
o Lord who art my Sauiour, and take mer∣cy on my sinneful soule. Loose the band thereof, & heale the woundes, O Lord Iesus. I desire thee, I seeke thee, I will thee: show me thy face, and I shall be safe. Send forth therefore, o most louing Lord (through the me¦rits of the most pure and immaculate euer Virgin Mary thy Mother, and thy Saintes) thy light,
and thy truth into my soule, which may shew vnto me truely all my defects, which it behoo∣ueth me to confesse; and which may helpe and teach me to expresse thē fully, and with contrite hart. Who liuest and rai∣gnest God, world with∣out end. Amen.
A BRIEFE METHODE OF CONFESSION, For those that frequent the same often. HE that is accusto∣med to confesse of∣ten, must be very care∣full of foure thinges. 1. Of the due examē of his Conscience. 2. Of com∣punction and sorrow for his sinnes. 3. Of the cō∣fession
it self, that it brief and humble, & sincere. 4. Of ful purpose & true endeauour to amend. This done let him come hūbly to his Gho∣stly Father, & kneeling downe at his feet, say: Benedicite. Confiteor Deo Omnipotenti &c in Latin or English, as he best can vntill the wordes, Mea culpa &c. Then say. First I accuse my selfe, that I come to this Sa∣crament
of Pennance not so well prepared as I ought to doe: for which I aske God hartily par∣don. I accuse my selfe, that I haue not had such sor∣row, and repentance for my sins past as I ought: for which I aske God hattily pardon. I accuse my selfe, that I haue not vsed such di∣ligence in the dayly exa∣mining of my cōscience,
and amendment of my life, as I ought to haue done: for which I aske God hartily pardon. I accuse my selfe, that I haue greatly offended Almighty God, in that I haue not giuē him due thankes for all his bene∣fits that I haue receaued cōtinually at his hands, for which I aske him hartily pardon. I accuse my selfe, that I haue not loued & ser∣ued
him with such feare, and reuerence, and hu∣mility of mind in all thinges, as I ought to haue done: for which I aske him hartily pardō. I accuse my selfe, that I haue not made my prayers vnto him, with that alacrity & feruour of spirit as I ought, but haue beene very often, and voluntarily distra∣cted, slouthful, & could in my prayers, deuoti∣ons,
and all other pious workes, and exercises: for which I aske him al∣so hartily pardon. I accuse my selfe, for that I haue beene proud & vaine glorious in my inward thoughts & co∣gitations: for which I aske God hartily pardō. I accuse my selfe, for that I haue beene very negligent in putting a∣way euill thoughtes of sundry sorts, and haue
not endeauoured to keep my mind occupyed in lawfull and Godly ex∣ercises, nor thought so humbly of my selfe, as I should haue done: for which I aske God harti∣ly pardon. I accuse my selfe, that I haue not kept my sen∣ses in such narrownes & custody, as I ought to haue done, especially my eyes, and my eares: for which I aske God harti∣ly
pardon. I accuse my selfe, for that I haue not spoken of other men, and their affaires, with that care, charity, and affection, as I should haue done, but rather haue discouered their defects: for which I aske God hartily par∣don. I accuse my selfe, that I haue not behaued my selfe so modestly in my actions, and conuersati∣ons
as I should haue done, but haue spent many houres idly in de∣sports, laughing, & idle discourses, without pro∣fit to my selfe or others: for which I aske God hartily pardon. I accuse my selfe, that in my workes I haue not purely sought Gods ho∣nour and glory, but ra∣ther some worldly res∣pect, or selfe-content herein: for which I ask
God hartily pardon. I accuse my selfe, that I haue not frequented the holy Sacraments of Confession, and Com∣munion with that due preparatiō & reuerence, as I ought to haue done: nor heard Masse, or o∣ther spirituall Exhorta∣tions with that attentiō, and deuotion, as was fit for such diuine myste∣ryes: for which I aske God hartily pardon.
I accuse my selfe, that I haue beene angry, me∣lancholy, froward, stub∣borne, and very trou∣blesome to others often tymes without cause: for which I aske God harti∣ly pardon. I accuse my selfe, that in my talke and other discourses, I haue not beene so careful to keep my tongue from vtte∣ring of some vntruthes, nor from swearing by
Fayth & Troth without necessity: for which I aske God hartily pardō. For these, and all my other sinnes and trans∣gressions, wherinsoeuer, & howsoeuer els, I haue offended my Lord God: & also for those that at this present I haue for∣gotten, and through my negligence cannot call to remembrance, I aske him hartily pardon and forgiuenes, and of you
my Ghostly Father, pē∣nance, and absolution. Ideo precor Beatam Ma∣riam &c. Or, Therefore I beseech the blessed &c. If besides this ordina∣ry method of Confessiō, thou shalt feele thy con∣science troubled or bur∣dened with these, or any other sinne, mortall or veniall, thou must ex∣presse them distinctly & orderly, withall their due circūstances, to the
end thy Ghostly Father may truly iudg of them, posing condign pennance, may absolue thee, according to the rites of the holy Catho∣like Church. A short prayer to be sayd presently after absolutio. LET, O Lord, I hū∣bly beseech thee, this my Confession be grate∣ful and acceptable vnto thy diuine Maiesty, by
the merites of bitter death, and passiō and by the of thy Blessed Mother, and all the Saints. And that whatsoeuer, now, or at other tymes hath been wanting in me, ei∣ther to the sufficiency of Contritiō, or to the pu∣rity and integrity of my Confession, let thy pie∣ty, and mercy, O Lord, supply the same; & ac∣cording therunto, vou∣chsafe
to absolue me more fully and perfect∣ly in heauen. To whom be all honour and glory world without end. A∣men. Sweet Iesus, A∣men.
A PRAYER BEFORE Receauing the B. Sacrament. O Most benigne Lord Iesus Christ, I a sin∣ner presuming nothing on myne owne merites▪ but trusting on thy mer∣cy & goodnes do feare, and tremble to haue ac∣cesse to the table of thy
most sweet banquet▪ For I haue a hart, and body spotted with many cri∣mes: a mind and tongue not warily guarded. Therfore o benigne dei∣ty, o dreadfull maiesty, I a wretch holde in thee straites, haue recourie vnto thee th fountaine of mercy, I hastē to thee to be healed, I flye vn∣der thy protectiō: & he whom I cannot endure, a Iudge, I hope to haue a
Sauiour. To thee, O Lord I shew my woūds: to thee I discouer my shame. I know my sins to be many, and great, for which I feare. I trust in thy mercyes, which are without number: looke downe vpon me with the eyes of thy mercy, o lord Iesu christ eternall King, God and man, crucified for man. Hear me graciously ho∣ping in thee: haue mer∣cy
vpon me full of wret∣chednesse and sin: thou that wilt neuer restraine the fountain of thy pie∣tie to flow. All haile healthfull sacrifice, offe∣red vpon the tree of the Crosse for me, and all man-kind. All haile, O noble & pretions bloud gushing out of the woū∣des of my Lord Iesus Christ crucifyed, & wa∣shing away the sinnes of the whole world. Re∣member,
O Lord thy Creature, whome thou hast redeemed with thy bloud: it repenteth me, that I haue sinned, I de∣sire to amend that which I haue done. Take away then from me, O most clement Father, al mine iniquities, and offences, that purified in mind & body, I may deserue worthily to tast the ho∣ly of holyes: and grant that this holy tasting of
thy bodie and bloud, which I vnworthy, desire to receaue, may be a re∣mission of my sins, a per∣fect purgation of my crimes, a driuing away of filthie cogitations, and a re-engendring of good thoughts, and also hole∣some efficacie of workes pleasing to thee, & with∣al a most firme protecti∣on of soule and body a∣against the deceiptes of my enemyes. Amen.
Another prayer before re∣ceauing the B. Sacrament. ALmighty & eternal God, behold I come to the Sacrament of thy only begotten Son, our Lord Iesus Christ. I re∣paire as one being sicke vnto the Phisitiā of life, as one vncleane vnto the fountaine of mercie, as one blind to the light of perpetuall brightnes, as one poore and needy
to the Lord of heauen & earth. I besiech thee ther¦fore by the aboūdance of thy infinite bounty, that thou wouldest vouchsafe to cure my infirmitity, to wash my filth, to en∣lighten my blindnes, to enrich my pouerty, to cloth my nakednes: that I may receaue thee, the bread of Angels, King of Kings, Lord of lords, with so great reuerence and humility, with so
great contrition and de∣uotion, with so great pu∣ritie and faith, with such purpose and intent, as is expedient for the health of my soule: graunt me I beseech thee, not only to receaue the Sacramēt of our Lords body, and bloud, but also the thing and vertue thereof. O God most meeke, grant me so to take the body of thy only begottē Son our Lord Iesus Christ,
which he tooke of the Virgin Marie; that I may deserue to be incorpora∣ted to his misticall bo∣dy, & accounted among the members therof. O most louing Father, grāt me for euer with open face to behold thy belo∣ned Sonne, whome now couered in this wayfare, I desire to receaue. Who togeather with thee, and the Holy Ghost &c.
A Prayer after receauing the B. Sacrament. I Giue thee thankes, O holy Lord, Father al∣mighty, eternall God, who hast vouchsafed to replenish me a sinner thy vnworthy seruant, through no merites of myne, but by the only vouchsafing of thy mer∣cy, with the pretious bo∣die and bloud of thy son our Lord Iesus Christ;
and I beseech thee, that this holy receauing, may not be to me as a guilt vnto punishment, but as a wholesome intercessiō vnto pardon. Let it be to me an armor of faith, & a shield of good will: let it be a cleansing of al my vices, a driuer out of concupiscence and lust, an increase of Charity, patience, humility, and obedience: a firme de∣fēce against the wiles of
all enemies, aswel visible as inuisible, a perfect quieting of my motions aswell carnall as spiritu∣all, a firme cleauing vn∣to thee, one & true God: and a happy consumati∣on of my end: and I be∣seech thee that thou wilt vouchsafe to bring me a sinner, vnto that vnspea∣keable feast: where thou with thy Sonne and the holy Ghost, art a true ight to thy Saints, a
complete fullnesse, an euerlasting gladnes, an absolute ioy, and a per∣fect felicity. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. Another prayer after recea∣uing the B. Sacrament. PIerce through, o sweet Lord Iesu the mar∣row, and bowells of my soule, with the most sweete, and holsome wound of thy loue, with thy true, cleere, most
ardent and holy Cha∣rity, that my soule may languish and melt, euen by the only loue and de∣sire of thee; let it couet thee, and euen languish after thee at thy gates; let it desire to be dissol∣ued, and to be with thee. Graunt that my soule may hunger after thee, the bread of Angels, the food of holy soules, our daily & supersubstantial bread, hauing all sweet∣nes,
and sauour, and all delightfulnes in it selfe: let my hart alwaies hun∣ger & eate thee, on whō the Angells desire to looke; and let the bow∣els of y soule be reple∣nished with the sweetnes of thy tast▪ let it alwaies thirst after thee, the foū∣tain of life, the foūtain of wisedome & knowledg, the fountaine of eternal light, the riuer of plea∣sure, the plentifulnes of
the house of God: let it alwayes earnestly couet thee, seek thee, and find thee▪ let it tend to thee, come vnto thee, thinke vpō thee, speak of thee, and worke all things vn¦to the prayse & glory o thy name, with humili∣ty, and discretion, with loue and delight, with facility and affection∣with perseuerance vnto the end: and thou alone be alwayes my hope, my
whole confidence, my riches, my delight, my pleasures, my gladnes, my rest and tranquility, my peace, my security, my odour, my sweet∣nes, my meat, my food, my refuge, my help, my wisedome, my portion my profession, my trea∣sure, in the which my mind & hart, is alwayes fixed, firme, and im∣moueably rooted. A∣men.
Another Prayer after recea∣uing the B. Sacrament. O Lord Iesus Christ, I humbly bessech thy vnspeakable mercy, that this Sacramēt of thy b∣by and bloud, which I (vnworthy) haue recea∣ued, may be to me a pur∣ging of offences, a forti∣tude against frailtyes, a fortresse against the pe∣rils of the world, an ob∣taining of pardō, an esta∣blishment
of grace, a medicine of life, a me∣mory of thy passion, a nourishmēt against wea∣kenes, & a rest of my pil∣grimage. Let it guide me going, reduce me wan∣dering, receaue me re∣turning againe, vphold me stumbling, lift me vp falling, and perseue∣ring bring me into glo∣ry. O highest God, let the most blessed presence of thy body and bloud
so alter the tast of my hart, that besides thee at any tyme it feele no sweetnesse, it loue no fairenes, it seeke no vn∣lawfull loue, it desire no consolation, it admit no delectation or pleasure, it care for no honour, it feare no cruelty. Who liuest and raignest, with God the Father, in the vnity of the Holy Ghost, world without end. Amen.
BRIEFE MEDITATIONS FOR THE SEAVEN dayes of the VVeeke, In imitation of seauen vertues of our Blessed Sauiour. By the R. Father Luke Pinelli, of the Society of IESVS. SVNDAY. Of Christs Humility. 1. COnsider the hu∣mility, which
the Son of God mani∣fested in his Incarnati∣on, in which for thee he annihilated himselfe, ta∣king vpon him the form of a seruant, the Lord of Maiesty became thy ser∣uant, to do thee seruice, he came downe heauen, where the Angells were attendant vpon him, & for an ample testimony of his humble seruice to thee, he pleased to be borne in a stable.
2. Consider, how this Lord of heauen, a while after hūbled him∣selfe much more in his Natiuity, when first he subiected his most ten∣der and delicate body to circumcision, and decla∣red himselfe as a sinner, and standing in need of a remedy (for Circum∣cision was a signe of sin, and a remedy against it) & he vouchsafed to nū¦ber himselfe among sin∣ners,
al the world behol∣ding it: and how more vile, and abiect could he make himselfe, then to take vpon him the forme of a seruant, and to be borne in a stable? 3. Consider the great affection of humility, that our Sauiour exerci∣sed in Iordan, when he pleased to be baptized by S. Iohn Baptist, where contemning his own re∣putation, he stood amid∣dest
base persons, and sinners, & was baptized by his Precursour as one of the multitude, and more contemptible sort. 4. Consider, how in his last supper, girding himselfe with a lynnen cloth, and falling downe vpon his knees before e∣uery one of his Apostls, he washed their feet. At the strangenes of which fact, they were so astoni∣shed and confounded,
as that S. Peter meruai∣ling at it more then the rest, that the Sonne of God abased himselfe so farre, would not, that he should wash his feet. 5. Consider the hu∣mility, that the King of Glory declared in his death, when he disday∣ned not to be crucifyed out of Hierusalem, in the midst betweene two theeues, in the feast of the Pasche, whither the
people were come from all partes in great num∣ber, by reasō of the feast; where he made a repre∣sentation of the shame∣fullnes of his most igno∣minious death to the vi∣ew of the whole world, when as at another tyme he made a manifestation of some little part of his glory to three of his dis∣cipls alone in the desert; neither yet, while he li∣ued, would speake any
word at al touching this matter. This Meditation being ended, you that turne the eyes of your mind vpō your selfe, and you shall stir vp these most profitable and practicall docu∣ments. 1. SInce that the K. of heauē, & my Lord hath humbled himselfe so many waies, is it meet that I the seruant, and a most vile worme of the earth, should extold my selfe? 2. Neither ought I
to make outwardly a∣ny more reckoning of my selfe, then I am in very deed. 3. Neither is it meet, that for the conseruing and entertaining of a vaine reputation of my name & credit, I should abandon, or giue ouer the care of my soule. 4. I must not in any sort withdrawe my selfe frō the exercise of those thinges, which I haue
giuen ouer. 5. I ought not also to conceale and keep hid∣den those thinges, that may serue for my morti∣fication, or to propose to the view of all men those thinges, that are wonte to turne to my honour. MVNDAY. Of the Obedience of Christ. 1. COnsider, what the Apostle saith of Christ: He was made obediēt euen vnto death
yea to obey the precepts of the law, wherunto he was not bound at all; & he refused no aduersi∣tyes, torments, & igno∣minyes, such as he suffe∣red in his circumcision, and in his whole sacred passion. 2. Consider, how he being the only Sonne of God, and the wisedome of the Eternall Father, was most obedient to his Mother, and to S. Ioseph
his reputed Father. And though he were for infi∣nite causes more holy, & more wise then they, yet he neuer resisted a∣gainst that they commā∣ded, nor murmured a∣gainst them, nor censu∣red them, but with grea∣test humility & promp∣titude executed, and did whatsoeuer they com∣manded him. 3. Consider the great affection, wherwith our
Sauiour tēdred the ver∣tue of Obedience, for which from the very beginning he protested to all, that he came into the world not to do his owne will, but the will of his Father. And ther∣fore in another place he called Obedience his meate, and therby he si∣gnifyed, that it was grea∣tly pleasing vnto him. 4. Consider, how he loued obedience, whiles
he not only considered not the person of him who commanded, nor also the difficulty of the thing commanded, but was further obedient to his enemyes, who tor∣mented him in his Pas¦sion, and treated him most ignominiously, when they crowned him with thornes. For being willed to strip himselfe of his garmentes, he de∣layed not to doe it: wil∣led
to sit downe, he o∣beyed: when the crown of thornes was put vpon his head, he contradi∣cted not, and he tooke the Reed in his hand, that was giuen him for a Scepter. 5. Consider, how the Lord of the Vniuerse o∣beyed without any re∣ply, or further appeale; in so much as he vsed not the very least word, & accepted of the most
vniust sentēce of death, vniustly pronounced a∣gainst him by his per∣uerse Iudges: and being willed by the Ministers, and officers to carry his owne Crosse, he gladly did it, and tooke it vpon his bruized and torne shoulders, and with it vpon his necke, as ano∣ther obedient Isaac, he went vp to mount Cal∣uary, there to be sacri∣ficed for our sinnes.
The documents, that may be gathered of this Meditation, be, that we omit nothing defectiue against obedience. 1 SInce the Sonne of God, without any obligation at all, obeyed with so great prompti∣tude, what shall be my punishment, if I shall not be obedient vnto him, to whome I am bound? 2. How grieuous shal my sinne be, if I shall peraduenture murmure
or rise against the com∣mandmentes of them, who haue power ouer me? 3. What excuse can I pretend, if for the do∣ing of myne owne will, I neglect the will and pleasure of my Lord God? 4. How great a shame and confusion will it be to me, if, that I may not endure any aduersity, I shall contemne to obey?
5. Who shall exem∣pt me from confusion, and fault, if I shall iarre and contend with him, who is my Superiour, & if, which is worse, I shal censure that vniust which is cōmanded me? TVESDAY. Of Christ his Patience. 1. COnsider, how Christ our lord, from the very instant, that he came into the
world, began to exercise patience. For when there was not any found in all Bethleem, that would receaue his Mother into their house, he was for∣ced to make choice of a poore Cot for the place of his natiuity, where the Manger serued for his bed, & cradle to lye in. Consider what man∣ner of intertainment he had, when his Mother was but a yong Virgin, a
poore stranger, and wea∣ryed by the payns of her long iourney, in the mi∣dest of winter, in a poore stable, in the night tyme and from home and out of her countrey. 2. Consider, how he was no sooner borne, thē that he was persecuted, when he was forced to flye into Aegypt because Herod sought his life, & to make him away Con∣sider, how many mise∣ryes
& aduersityes, the poore little child suffe∣red in so long and payn∣full a iourney, and in Aepypt, a strange and barbarous coūtrey, wher he liued in a most poore manner for some yeares by the labours & paines of S. Ioseph, & his poore Mother. 3. Consider the pati∣ence, that the Iewes put him vnto, when they of∣ten called him a seducer
of the people, seditious, a Magitian, & raiser vp of Diuels, an enemy of God, blasphemer, a pre∣uaricatour, & transgres∣sour of the Law, & gaue out that he was a drin∣ker of wine: sometymes in a fury they rose a∣gainst him, and had a desire one tyme to stone him, another tyme to thrust him downe head∣long from the top of an hill: but our meeke Iesus
is not recorded either to haue reuenged himselfe of so great iniuryes, or to haue been incensed at al against the ingratefull people, but to haue stu∣dyed to do them good e∣uery way. 4. Consider, how pa∣tient he was in al his do∣lourous passion. When he was layed hand on in the garden, and carryed away, as a thiefe bound fast; was in the sight of
Annas censured for arro∣gant, and receaued that vnworthy buffet at the hands of a most vile bound-slaue: Caiphas held him for a blasphe∣mer, and Herod for a foole; and being trea∣ted for such an one, he endured all without any perturbation of mind, and with exceeding pa∣tience. Consider the sin∣gular acts of patience, which our Sauiour exer∣cised
in the house of Pi∣late, where he was boūd fast to a pillar, scourged as some notorious male∣factour, scorned & moc∣ked in putting on the crowne of thornes vpon his head, grieuously pay∣ned therewith, his diuin face not only buffeted, but also defiled with most loathsome spittle; and when he had much a do to stand, they for∣ced him to carry his own
crosse, whereon he was nailed, and did hang till death. All this & much more our Lord suffered with so great patience, as he complained not at al. Of this Meditation you shall conceaue a confusion and shame, for that you haue suffered so little, or nothing at all for our Lord, who hath suffered so much, & so great matters for vs. 1. THov who see∣est, how much thy Sauiour hath endu∣red for thee, say now, who dost complayne so
much, what thou hast suffered for him? 2. Thou hast not yet from the first instant of thy natiuity begun to suffer. 3. Thou hast not yet beene persecuted vnto death, nor against all e∣quity and conscience. 4. Thou hast not byn scourged, nor crowned with thorns, nor nayled to a crosse, nor so much as shed one droppe of
bloud for thy Creatour. 5. What manner of pa∣tience is thyne, when for euery little aduersity, or word, thou art troubled, or fillest the ayre with complaints? WEDNESDAY. Of Christ his Meeknes 1. COnsider, how the Scripture sayd of Christ to the Countrey of Iury: Loe thy King commeth vn∣to
thee, meeke. For where the worlds desert was, that our lord shold haue come downe from heauen, armed with the sword of Iustice, to take vengeance on the ini∣quityes of it, he descen∣ded all benigne, and gentle, that he might re∣dresse it, and giue a re∣medy vnto it by meek∣nes, and not chasten it with the seuerity, and ri∣gour of his diuin iustice.
2. Cōsider, how Christ was most meek towards his disciples, and gently bare with their defects, when they contented a∣bout the primacy amōg themselues: when they were angry with Mary Magdalen, at her an∣noynting his head with precious oyntment: whē they forsook him, in the garden, when-he was be∣trayed into the Iewes hands. For in these and
the like defects Christ, out of his Gentlenes, chose rather meekly and benignly to blame them the in a more seuere mā∣ner, to checke them by shar reprehension. 3. Consider the meek∣nes, that he vsed towards the Scribes & Pharisies his enemyes, who calū∣niated his workes, and iniustly persecuted him, affirming that he droue out vncleane spirits in
the power of Beelzebub: when he pardoned him, his sins, who was trou∣bled with the palsey, and that he blasphemed: & that he had a diuell, whē he reprehended them. For our Lord by answe∣ring with mildnes to these & other their like calumniatiōs, confoun∣ded their ill meaning, boldnes, and ouermuch presumption. 4. Consider further,
how our Lord discoue∣red his meeknes in the presence of the Diuell. For he permitted him∣selfe to be tempted of him, and though he best knew the peruerse wil of the bad and malignant spirit, and might at the first haue confounded him, put him to silence, and driuen him away; yet he chose rather to o∣uercome him with mild answeres, and in that
manner to controle the extreme boldnes of the infernall friend. 5. Consider the won∣derfull signes of meeke∣nes, that Christ vsed to∣wards Iudas, who be∣trayed him. For though he knew that he had sold him for money, yet he louingly admitted him to his table, washed his feete, and when the houre was come, that he deliuered him into the
handes of his enemyes, he friendly imbraced him, permitted him to giue him a kisse, and by calling him friend, in a mild manner wished him to remember him∣selfe, and did put him in mind of the sin, that he then committed. Fi∣nally like a meek lambe he suffered himselfe to be bound, and to be lead whithersoeuer his Ad∣uersaries thought best.
The fruit of this meditation shalbe to vnderstand the defect and want of meeknes, that lyeth hid in thee, and to take paines for the gayning of it. 1. HOw farre thou comest short of thy meeke master Iesus, who art not able to bear with the very least defect in thy Neighbours? 2. How little thy mee∣kenes is, who art angry at euery least word, and threatnest therfore. 3. What wouldst thou
now doe, if calumnyes were raised against thee, or that thou wert iustly persecuted. 4. What wouldst thou do, if thou wert sold, & betrayed of him, who had receaued singular benefits at thy hands, as Christ our lord was sold and betrayed of his dis∣ciple Iudas, vpon whom he had cōferred so great benefits?
THVRSDAY. Of Christs contempt of the world. 1. COnsider, how our Sauiour cō∣temned all those things, that men of the world desire and seeke after. For first he contemned the riches of this world, and lead so poore a life, as he would not haue possessiō of any earthly thing at all, but liuing of almes, was contented
with those thinges, that were necessary for his state of pouerty, and for cloathing. 2. Consider, how he despised al pleasures and carnall delectations. For the Iewes, who had trea∣ted him ignominiously many wayes, neuer durst infame him touching Chastity, which he so plainely demonstrated in his very face, as it in∣duced and moued euery
one, who beheld him, to chastity, and purity of life. 3. Consider, how he not only contemned the honours & dignityes of this world, but also, at what tyme the Iewes would once haue made him King, he accepted it not, but went away from them, as from his enemyes, declyning all other titles & dignityes whatsoeuer. And there∣fore
he prescribed vnto his Apostles, that the greater of them should be the others seruant: & therof he had giuen thē an instance before, and had giuen answere to Ze∣bedeus his sonnes, who made petition vnto him for an earthly dignity, that they knew not what they asked. 4. Consider, how he contemned the pleasurs & contentments, which
worldly men so greedily seeke after; and thereu∣pon some called him a Carpenter, because he assisted S. Ioseph in his Carpenters trade: and arriuing to 30. years of age, he withdrew him∣self into the desert, wher he punished his most innocēt flesh with very soare pennance; and all the remnant of his life after, euer trauailed in procuring the soules
health of his neighbors. 5. Cōsider, how cheer∣fully he imbraced the things, which this blind world conceaueth so great an horrour of, and flyeth from; that is, he made no reckoning of iniuryes, reproaches, disgraces, tribulations: contempt, and to be re∣puted a foole; he neuer sought to be reuenged, as the world doth: and when as by the very least
signe he might haue pu∣nished his enemyes, he would not doe it, but with a great & generous mind forgaue all them who had offended him. y this meditation you shall learne to know your inward affections, for the gouerning and moderating thereof, as is most fitting. 1. HEnce you may learne, whether you follow the standard of the World, or of christ. For if you in hart
desire more, then is ne∣cessary, or be carryed a∣way with carnall pleasu∣res, with an affection to be honoured and estee∣med of men, & with the vanityes of this life; a signe it is, that in affecti∣on you follow the world though you make out-wardly neuer so greatshew to the contrary. 2. But if your care be to please your Sauiour, and to be like him, and
willingly imbrace tribu∣ations, and loue to be mocked & contemned; t is a signe, that you are a good souldier, and the true disciple of Christ. FRIDAY. Of Christs Charity towards his Neighbours. 1. COnsider, how the Sonne of God, whereas he was in Heauen adored of the Angels, neither stood in
neeed of any thing, but was most happy & bles∣sed in himselfe, pleased to vndergoe the person of a needy man, exposed to a thousand aduersi∣tyes and dangers, tha he might in this calami¦tous banishment be ou maister & conductour whereunto not his owne profit, and vtility, bu his sincere and earnest loue towards vs moued him.
2. Consider, how our Sauiour thought it not inough to haue take on him mans nature for vs, but also, whē he saw that it was not within the cō∣passe of our weake abili∣tyes to satisfy the diuine iustice for our faults & transgressions, he layed all vpon his own shoul∣ders, and abundantly sa∣tisfyed for all mankind And though his satisfa∣ction was superabundāt,
where one drop of bloud had beene more then i∣nough, yet he shed all. 3. Cōsider how, thogh he foresaw there would be many who would not acknowledg this so great a benefit, & would shew thēselues vnworthy of so great charity, he did not for all that cease to loue vs, nor loued vs the lesse, neither reiected he the ingratefull from be∣ing capable of his bene∣fits,
but as the inexhaust Goodnes, as he was in∣deed, most munificent∣ly, & most liberally be∣stowed himself vpon al. 4. Consider the pains trauailes, and troubles, which Christ endured for helping his Neigh∣bours, & you shall giue a gesse at the greatnes of his Charity For he tra∣uayled from one castle to another on foot, and from one Synagogue to
another, shewing vnto all the way of saluation: he neither feared, nor regarded any aduersi∣tyes at all, so he might preach the kingdome of heauē to the multitude. And therfore among o∣ther thinges, though he were wearied of his iour∣ney, and it were very late he yet cheerfully refused meate, whereof he stood in much need, that he might conuert the Sa∣maritan
woman. 5. Consider the great loue, which our Sauiour shewed towards vs, whē in the end he loued vs so as he left himselfe vnto vs in the most holy Sa∣crament of the Altar. Neither did he leaue vs any lesser testimony of his loue in his sacred passiō, who to set vs free from the bondage of the Diuell, and the miseryes of sin, endured the most
cruell tormentes that e∣uer were: and while he hanged vpon the crosse, prayed to his heauēly fa∣ther for his Crucifiers, & excused them in these wordes: Father forgiue them, for they know not what they doe. Heere turne your eyes vpon your selfe, and by comparing your selfe with Christ, you shall stir vp your soule to the loue of your neighbour, which is the fruit of this Meditation. 1. VVILL you know how great your
Charity towardes your neyghbours is? Examin it with that, which you doe for them, and you shal find it to be as great as be the trauails, payns, & incommodityes, that you take & suffer in hel∣ping them. 2. If thou dost good neither to the soule, nor body of thy neighbors, neither hast wil to with∣draw the very least thing from thy selfe for their
profit: and if what thou doest, thou do it there∣fore because it turneth to thyne owne vtility, what manner of Charity is that of thine? 3. He that hath true charity, wisheth spiritu∣all good to his neigh∣bour, as to himselfe, prayeth to God for him, assisteth him in his neces∣sityes as he is able, and willingly forgiueth him, wherein he hath offen∣ded
him. SATVRDAY. Of Christs diligence in spi∣rituall matters. 1. COnsider, how diligent our Sa∣uiour was in obseruatiō of the law, no otherwise thē if he had byn boūd. For the eight day he was circumcised, and the 40. day he was presented in the Temple; at euery time of the yeare, as it
was appointed, he went vp to Hierusalem, ac∣cording to the custome to worship God there: and he euer respected S. Ioseph, and his Mother, as the law commanded. 2. Consider how, whē he was to preach pen∣nance to others, he wold first of al experience it in himselfe. For after his Baptisme, he retyred into the desert, where he gaue himselfe most
diligently, with fasting, and punishing of his owne body, to contem∣plation, & to other spi∣rituall exercises. 3. Consider how after his returne from out of the desert he begun to preach, & with an ami∣able diligence endea∣uoured to shew the way of saluation to all. To the infirm he gaue dou∣dle health both of body, and of spirit; he repro∣ued
vice, he exhorted to vertue: he went vp and downe from place to place, that he might help many. To be short that he might do good, he spared no pains at al. 4. Consider, how his wil also was, that his dis∣ciples should be diligent in doing of good works. For he oftē sent thē forth to the adioyning castles to preach, to cast forth Diuells, to cure the sicke
and diseased, and there∣fore he often exhorted them to great Charity, for he best of all knew, that such diligence was the mother, and begin∣ning of all spirituall workes. 5. Consider, how dili∣gent, and serious he was in prayer; and when as by day, by reason of his ouermuch busines, wher¦with he was detayned in preaching, and in the
conuersion of his neigh∣bors, he could not pray, he attended to prayer by night, and as S. Luke sayth, he spent the night in the prayer of God. And this is also mani∣fest, for that, before he began his passion, in great humility and ear∣nestnes he addressed his prayer thrice vnto his heauenly Father; and in the expiration of his life he pleased to end it,
and to dye in praying; namely, while he did hang vpon the Crosse, he prayed first for his persecutours, and in say∣ing: Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit, he gaue vp his Ghost. The fruit, that is to be gathered of this Meditation. 1. IF the Sonne of God were so dili∣gent, not for any profit that were to redound to
himselfe, why shouldst not thou be confoūded, who art so negligent in matters of spirit, that were prescribed for the good of thy soule. 2. What will it help thee, if thou be cir∣cumspect in temporall and transitory things, & shalt be negligent in prayer, mortification, pennance, and other spi∣rituall functions? 3. Thou art also de∣ceaued,
if thou be di∣ligent in thy particuler deuotions, and slouth∣full, and drowsy in the obseruation of the com∣mandements of God, & of the Church. 4. If thou desire to attaine to a diligence in spiritual matters, endea∣uour to loue them, for that the more thou shalt be affected vnto them, the more diligent wilt thou be inprocuring thē.
ANNOTATIONS. FOR the due performing of the former Meditations it is to be vnderstood, that the Vertues of our Sauiour may be meditated vpon, three manner of wayes. 1. First, that we may vnderstand their nature and perfection, as the Phi∣losophers vse to contemplate the heauens for the vnderstanding of their nature. 2. Secondly, for the praysing, & magnifying of him, who had so excel¦lent vertues. And this second manner is both more noble, and more gratefull to God; for that it hath a more excel∣lent, and a more perfect end, that is, the praysing of Gods Godnes. 3. Thirdly, for imitation, and purchasing of thē: & this is the best mā∣ner of all, and more excellent then the other two, and more pleasing to God.
For besides that, that it comprehendeth the excellency of the two other, it hath withall a most noble end, which ma∣keth a man like vnto the sonne of God. And that is, the greatest perfection of all, that a reasonable creature hath, or can haue in this life. Moreouer in this manner be exer∣cised the three powers of the soule. The Memory layeth before the eyes Christs life, as the acts of vertue, which he ex∣ercised, whiles he liued. The Vnder∣standing discourseth about the vertues, and the qualityes of then. And the Wil to the same vertues applyeth Affection which helpeth to the attayning of those vertues, for in that in which a thing is loued, in that it is sought for to be at∣tained. The vtilityes of his last manner be diuers. 1. The first purgeth the soule from
vices. For while the vertues are planted, the vices are destroyed in it. 2. The second restoreth it to the former beauty, and seemlynes, and di∣recteth it: for that by the vertues the passions are brought backe againe to their naturall order, that they doe no more, then what they are swayed vnto by reason. 3. The third illuminateth: for that the soule informed, and furnished with vertues, and not troubled with passions, both seeth, discerneth, & iud∣geth the better. 4. The fourth maketh it grate∣full to the Creatour, and to all other creatures, sith there is nothing, that maketh a man so amiable, as doth ver∣tue, which draweth the very enemyes to loue and admire it. 5. The fifth enricheth it with merits, for that all the vertuous acts of
him, who is in grace, be meritorious. And the way of reaping some fruit in these Meditations, is this, that a man put on an effectuall, and earnest desire of attayning the said vertues, for from this desire proceedeth the exercise ther∣of, which is the principall, and only way to purchase them. Wherfore vpon Sunday he, who meditateth of the hu∣mility of Christ, must exercise many acts of Humility. Vpon Munday, he must exercise acts of Obedience, and so of the rest. It is not euer neces∣sary to meditate vpon all the fiue points of the Meditation, but it is inough to insist vpon one, or two, and oftentymes in the day to exercise the vertue, that be hath meditated vpon, & to craue grace of God to go forwardes therein, euery day more and more.

The beginning of the Ghos∣pell, according to S. Iohn. Glory be to thee, O Lord. IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, & God was the Word. This was in the begin∣ning with God. All thinges were made by him: and without him was made nothing,
which was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men: and the light shineth in dar∣kenesse, and darknesse did not comprehend it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was Iohn. This mā came for testimony, to giue testimony of the light, that all might belieue through him. He was not the light, but to giue testimony of the light.
It was true light which lightneth euery mā that cōmeth into this world. He was in the World, & the World was made by him, and the World knew him not. He came into his owne, and his owne receaued him not. But as many as receaued him, he gaue them pow∣er to be made the Sōnes of God, to those that be∣lieue in his Name: who not of bloud, nor of the
will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God are borne. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in vs (and we saw the glory of him, glory as it were of the only begotten of the Fa∣ther) full of grace and verity. Thankes be to God.
