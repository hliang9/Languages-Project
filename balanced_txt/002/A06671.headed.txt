A RELATION OF THE PASSAGES OF OVR ENGLISH COMPANIES FROM time to time since their departure from England, to the parts of Germanie, and the vnited Prouinces. MY loue and dutie (Right Worshipfull) vrging me oftentimes (since my de∣parture from England) to make an explanation of the same to your selfe, with the rest of my good friends, and now comming to a fulnesse of affection, I am here to giue you a certification, of all the occur∣rances and passages in seruice from those trouble∣some parts of Germanie, where I am now resi∣dent: and although I am a little preuented, in lay∣ing open the full discourse of our Iournalls or Martch, by the departure of many of our Regi∣ment that are returned backe to England, who hath reported more then I am able to write, yet neuerthelesse, will I giue you a touch of our tra∣uaile
and martch, as my remembrance will giue me leaue. First, wee had a quicke passage to Roterdam, from thence to Delfe, where wee were muste∣red for the King of Bohemia, and was billited there for three weekes, where we had our Appa∣rell, our Hats, and Colours, with our Armes giuen to vs: from thence we Marcht vp the Riuer of Rhine to Rayse, where we stayed vntill we heard from his Excellence; from thence we Marcht vp the Rhine, vntill wee came right against Wesell, where his Excellence lay with twenty thousand Horse and Foote, and mounted his Ordinance against Wesell, where wee lay in leaguer the most part of Iuly, vntill the Bridge was made ouer the Rhine: and the first of August we Marcht ouer the Rhine; his Excellencies Musketieres gaue vs three volleyes of shot at our departing: from thence we Marcht accompanied with Graue Hen∣rick, and his troupes of Horse, and when we came to our lodging, wee were entertayned by the Boores of the Countrey, with fresh Straw, Bread, and Beere, and what else wee could get, and so Marcht forwards, sometimes twenty miles a day, sometimes more, and sometimes lesse: but Spin∣dola made account to cut vs off euery man of vs; & because we Marcht extraordinary, he reported the Diuell did leade vs; but I am sure that God was our guide and defender, and so wee Marcht vntill wee came to a Towne called Bensum, where we were billited three dayes, where we had good
Wine in aboundance, and good cheare with it. The Wine was commonly set on the Table in a Paile or some such like vessell, wherein wee filled our glasse, and dranke euery man his belly full. From this Towne wee Marcht towards Anne, where dwelleth Graue Henrickes sister, who is Prin∣cesse of that place, and she Royally came to vs in the Field, with other Gallants in their Caroches, guarded with Horse and Foote, whom courte∣ously greeted our Lords and Captaines, we stand∣ing in Battalia manner, which when she returned, wee Marcht to a little Dorpe neere adioyning, where wee had two Alarums that night, which caused most of vs to leaue our victuals behind vs: some their meate a boyling, and some rosting, which was a great griefe vnto vs being hungry the next day. Also it was the first time that wee had any Alarum, and so wee Marcht from that Dorpe towards Wormes, where wee Marcht ouer the Riuer, and so thorough Wormes to a Dorpe sixe miles distant from that place, and so wee Marcht vp and downe vntill wee did meete with the Princes of the Vnion, who ioyned with our forces to meete Spindola, who lay then in a Towne called Vpnam, which was yeelded to him, and there he Entrencht his Forces, that by no meanes possible they could remoue him out; wherefore the Generall gaue command to draw our Forces into Field to giue him battaile, and so we Marcht vntill wee had sight of his Forces, and wee Marcht about to get the winde of them, the
which we obtayned, and then our Generall gaue commaund to draw out part out of euery Com∣pany, to be of the Forlorne Hope, to giue the on∣set, whereof my selfe was one of the number, and Doctor Burges our Minister did encourage vs to fight valiantly, and did assure vs wee should finde our reward in heauen: whereupon we feasted our selues with such victuals as wee had, and threw away our Snap-sackes, with all our Prouision, both linnen and woollen, because it would be troublesome to vs, and couragiously prouiding vs for the battaile, and vpon the suddaine wee heard the Enemies Drums beate a Martch, where wee discried them to Martch backe againe to our Lodgings the next morning, for wee remay∣ned in the Field all that night, the next day our Generall had notice giuen him, that the Enemie did martch towards the Citie of Wormes, where∣fore hee gaue commaund the next night to martch without sound of Drumme, or display∣ing our Coulours, thinking to meete with him before he came to VVormes: but the Enemie had intelligence of our comming, wherefore they re∣turned backe into their Trenches that night, be∣ing extreame colde, that it killed many of our Souldiers, as namely Captaine Trussell, my Lieu∣tenant, and diuers others, whom died when they came to Garrison into Frankendale, which was a little befor Christmas, for the Rayne and Snow began to fall, that wee were not able to lye any longer in the Fields: wherefore wee marcht into
Frankendale, where we haue duty enough put vp∣on vs, for euery third night we watch at the Ports and Bulwarkes, standing Sentinell on the walles with our Armes in our hands: we do make them to stand, be he friend or foe, and cry que vella? be∣sides Alarums, which often times falles out, some times two or three in a weeke: wee had Alarum on the Saterday night before Shroue-Sunday, where wee were drawne all on the walls, and on the next night following wee were drawne out of the Towne, expecting to meete with some of the Enemies Forces, but we did not; and marching neere vnto Wormes without sound of Drumme or displaying our Coulours, they thought vs to be Enemies, wherefore they shot at vs, and hurt two of our Company, wherefore wee discried our selues, and Marcht backe againe: and now wee are certified that Lepoltus the Emperours brother is comming downe with twelue thousand to ayde Marques Spindola against vs, and they haue repor∣ted to besiege this Towne and Wormes both in one day, but before they winne them, it will cost them hote liquor, for our Generall gaue com∣maund to burne some Townes neere vnto vs, be∣cause the Enemie shall not Intrench his Forces neere vs, and the Boores that dwelt in them haue brought their Goods into our Towne, and they themselues doe worke vpon our Walles without the Towne, and are making halfe Moones, Scon∣ces, Bulwarkes, Counterscarfes, and Trenches. Wee haue had lately 12. Peeces of Ordinance
from Wormes to plant vpon our Walles, besides the Peeces that were planted before, which will encounter with them before they come at our Towne; and afterwards, our nimble Muskatieres will speake three words at once to them: Wee haue in our Towne many Streetes, and in euery Streete one Well with two Buckets of very good water, also a good Riuer running thorough the Towne: and neuerthelesse, wee haue Wine in the Towne as plentifull as water, which is solde vnder three pence the quart: also Bread and Beere as good and cheaper then in England, and so of Flesh and other commodities. There was in our martch good Hogs solde for twelue pence a peece and vnder, also Pullets, Pidgions, and other flesh very reasonable. I thinke we shall not haue the like penny-worthes when wee come to England: but we hope well, and purpose to make a tryall of it, and now vnwilling to be too tedi∣ous, I will abruptly conclude. So remembring my loue and commendations to all my good friends, I rest: committing you to the protection of the Almighty, this 9. of March. 1621. A. M. From Frankendale in Germanie.
