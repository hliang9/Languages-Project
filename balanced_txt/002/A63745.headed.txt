A True Representation TO THE KING and PEOPLE of ENGLAND; How Matters were carried on all along in IRELAND BY THE Late King James, In Favour of the Irish Papists there: From His Accession to the CROWN, To the Tenth of April, 1689. By an Impartial Eye-Witness. LICENS'D, Aug. 16. 1689. J. Fraser. LONDON, Printed for Richard Chiswell, at the Rose and Crown in St. Paul's Church-yard, MDCLXXXIX.
A True Representation to the King and People of England, how Matters were carried on all a∣long in Ireland, by the Late King James, in Fa∣vour of the Irish Papists there, &c. TO satisfie those that make it their business to reflect on the Protestants who left Ireland in the late Ca∣lamities; the following Reasons are briefly offered. First, It is clearly evident, That Ireland is a Kingdom depending on England, and that the Acts passed in it are to be altered, amended, and confirmed by the King and Council of England, as by Poyning's Act in Ireland, may more fully appear. That England receiv'd K. J. as their law∣ful King, is likewise granted; and that Ireland intirely sub∣mitted, is evident: And here I will not enter into a tedious discourse of all the measures taken since 1660, to subvert the Protestant Religion, and the Laws Established, (which will be shortly at large set forth, by another Hand, to the full satisfaction of every Impartial and Ʋnprejudiced per∣son) but briefly and truly give an account of the Proceed∣ings in Ireland since his Accession to the Crown. It is plain, that his whole endeavours were bent to intro∣duce Popery, and establish it in these Kingdoms, and that he could not more readily effect it, and try the Genius of his Protestant Subjects of Ireland (who were taught to yield him Passive Obedience, by the easie compliance of some of their Party then in power, to his fierce Incroachments) than by a new modelling of the Army there; which in a very little time was so purged, that scarce a true Protestant, or honest Gentleman was left in it: And tho' it began by degrees whilst his Excellency the Lord Clarendon had the Sword, yet it was fully executed (to the almost ruine of many a worthy Gentleman, whose fortune depended on it) a little
after the Lord Tyrconnel had the honour of being his Depu∣ty in that Kingdom. This being the first step, the Irish were made Officers, and Troops and Companies filled every where with them, and were trained and exercised by an ex∣traordinary diligence of some good old Officers, kept in I suppose of purpose for it, who soon became, not only con∣temners of their Protestant Commanders, but were preferred to their places. So that the Sword (and consequently the Mi∣litary command of that Kingdom) was wholly in their pow∣er. The next thing to be looked into was the Civil Magi∣strate, and he who was known to be a true Protestant, was laid aside, and new Judges of the right stamp were first Coyned, who had command in their respective Circuits to inform the Government of all Protestant Justices (or Crom∣well's favorers as they called them) who were likewise pre∣sently eased of their Commissions, and all other Impoloy∣ments. Then the Officers of the Revenue were also purged; and several of the Irish who had got in among them (in infe∣riour Stations) yet in regard they were not so well qualified as the Protestants, by a knowledge in those affairs, some were removed, and the most useful of the Protestants restored for a while; yet as the Irish grew skilful, the Protestants still were outed again: Matters being thus acted and the Protestant No∣bility, and many of the Gentry knowing of no better Expedi∣ent than to come into England (since they could not struggle against the King's will, which was a Law in Ireland) there∣fore they removed hither to make a Remonstrance of the Grievances of that Kingdom to the late King: and tho' they flock'd over out of all parts, yet they prevailed so little to gain any redress, that they saw plainly they could not return into Ireland without apparent hazard of their Lives. And now was it judged by the Ld. Deputy the fittest time for him to put his long contrived designs of Subverting the Protestant Religion, and introducing Popery, into full Execution; upon which in November last, there was a motion made in Council for disarming all the rest of the Protestants of that
Kingdom, which being known, and most concluding that as soon as their Arms were taken (there being then a hot Discourse of a general Massacre intended) 'twas only to leave them more naked and exposed, so as that might have its full effect more easily, and with less opposition upon them, which alarm'd the Protestants so, that many thousands came flocking over to avoid that fatal stroke. Now were the few Protestants who lived disperst left to shift for them∣selves. In the mean time the Lord Tyrconnel (who still had the Sword undemanded and undisposed of to any other) issues new Commissions, not only to the Ro. Ca. who had some Estates; but to all, who were willing to stand up for the Cause, that were men of broken Fortunes and worse Fame, but could influence the Rabble and raise Companies, only with this Salvo, that they should maintain them for 3 months on their own cost and charge, and then they should have their Commissions given them: by which it was ad∣judged, that in regard there was but little Money in the Treasury, they should be fitted for service against the time K. J. should come, or send them Money; or, that if the De∣puty found an Army ready to Land out of England, what Money was there would be little enough to bear his Char∣ges, and furnish him with Necessaries on his flight. But these Commissions (or rather Incouragements) being very many, for every one who could get about 60 Kearnes, or Country Fellows to joyn with them, and own him as their Captain, immediately strutted and looked very big, and was ho∣noured, by the name of Captain; so that it was nothing strange to have 20 or 30 Companies in a County, and these the noted Idlers and Cow-stealers. So that presently the Captains (many of which had not 3 Cows of their own) had several scores of Cattle driven into Nooks and By-Paths; and all that were branded, were sure to go to Pot, in regard the Horne (as they called it) spoke English; the rest were sent into other remote Counties to the Officers there, and those again sent their stolen Cattle in exchange
for the other (which was done to elude a Proclamation from the Lord Deputy on the many and daily Complaints and Petitions he receiv'd on account of the stolen Cattle) requiring all Officers and Soldiers as well as others to be aiding and assisting to recover the stolen Cattle, and to pu∣nish the Offenders; which pass'd for currant. For it was well if a Protestant could go safe to the Captain of the next Garrison, who sometimes would be so civil (especially if a Sum of money were given his men to assist in the search) as to send 8 or 10 miles, but be sure the Cattle must be far enough from the place searched; and sometime when 30 or 40 good fat Bullocks came to be made a Prey, that a∣bout a 3d or 4th part must be laid aside for the Pot; the rest for a Bribe of 5 or 6 l. would be got by some of the Sol∣diers, who would swear lustily they were forced to promise so much to their Spy: Yet no sooner (on the delivery of the greater part of the Cattle, and the money receiv'd) but be sure in a night or two the Cattle were again stolen. Thus the merry Drovers (as they called themselves) valued not to joyn about 60, or 80, or 100 in one Party, and force away what Cattle they had a mind to: so that sometimes 100 Sheep would scarce feed the Drivers with their Families and Friends; and a purchace of about 100, was only fit to be divided among them and their Crew into Lots and Parts, (but they called them Steages.) And now these new rais'd Forces were most of them half armed out of the Stores, the rest were pretty well fitted for Pikes made in the Country, and the Priests and Fryars commanded (on obedience to the Holy See) that no person whatsoever should appear at Mass without his long Skeane and Half∣pike, which accordingly was performed, and one person who had not one foot of Land but what he Farmed from an English Gentleman, had 12 dozen of each made for him∣self and Tenants, an account whereof was sent the Govern∣ment, but no notice taken. And now was it judged fit that those new rais'd forces should
betake themselves to Garrisons, which was suddainly done —And not only were the Kings Garrisons, Forts, and Ca∣stles, well stored with them, but many Gentlemens houses that were strengthy, (or whose ownes were judged dis∣affected to them) were likewise filled with their Numbers, and the Proprietors, or Possessors turned out, and the provi∣sion seized, (and it was an extraordinary favour to get off any Goods that were of any value) on pretence that it was for the Kings use, and that he would make satisfaction as he thought fit, and that it was done by his Command. Now was it plain, that this Army was not designed to fight with Butterflies, and that the Lives of all the Prote∣stants that stayed, were in apparent danger: On which an humble request was made to one or two persons of greatest Quality and Station, to stand up for the Protestant Religion. — But either through too much Loyalty, or judging the scattered and dispersed Protestants, too weak to withstand their shock, (much less to disarm the Party designed) was therefore declined and judged unfit to attempt as they pro∣posed, seizing the Sword, Lord Deputy, and Dublin. Matters being thus transacted, it was judged by the Protestant Gentry of the West of Ireland, that in regard Sligoe, (which is a Sea-port Town, and the chief in the County) one of the best Posts and strongest, being also well situated to pass from the North to Connaght; (the Irish Company a little before being drawn out of it to a General Rendez∣vouz) and many of their new raised Forces possessing them selves daily of the most considerable strengths in the Coun∣ty, as Belahy, Moygara, which belongs to the L. Kingston and his Tenants, Ousted, and Ballymoate; therefore, lest they should likewise possess themselves of Sligo as they intended, it was resolved by the Protestants there to enter it, and pos∣sess themselves of it for their defence and safety: and so they did unanimously issue their Declaration on the 4th day of Janar. last, that they associated themselves in the necessary defence of their Lives and the Protestant Religion as by Law
established, which to their utmost powers they would main∣tain, and would not prejudice even Roman Catholicks whilst they demeaned themselves according to the Laws —The Protestants then chose the Right Honorable Robert L. Baron of Kingstone, and the Honor. Chidley Coote, Esq their Com∣manders in chief, to whom they promised intire obedience. —And accordingly all were formed into Troops and Com∣panies, and all furnished themselves with the Men under their respective Commands, with Horses, Arms, Ammu∣nition, Provisions, &c. imploying all the Smiths in fixing Arms, making Pikes, Stars, and other Inventions against Horse, and to defend Forts, buying all the Scythes, and fix∣ing them on Poles, building up the old and decayed Forts, making Draw bridges, ordering frontier Garrisons, keeping strong Watch and Ward on all Quarters, at Grange near Mid-way to Balishannon, to hold their Correspondence with Derry, at New-town, Dromahere, and Mannerhamelton, to have intelligence with Enniskilling, at Dr. Leslies, at Coolooni, and Marcray, to prevent an infal from the Boyle, or Ballymoate; at Ardinglass, Lackan, and Cottlestown, to awe the new rais'd Army in the County of Mayo, part of which had seized the Bishop of Killalla's House: And when one Mr. Trem∣ble (a Servant of Sir Arthur Gore's) ask'd one Captain Walter Bourke why he would seize the Bishop's House, and make it a Garrison, the Gate was shut upon him, and he set upon and barbarously murthered. Likewise an Account of the Protestants, who were at Foxford, and many other places, who were drawing to Sligo on the Orders that issued for disarming all Protestants of the Kingdom; as also to take all their Service-Horses, which was obeyed with that Secrecy, Diligence, and Care, that not so much as a Plow-Horse was left; so that many a Fa∣mily, for want of a Horse to carry their Luggage, was forced to stay and submit to their merciless Cruelty; but this Garrison relieved and conveyed many a distressed and robbed Protestant to Sligo, who soon was recruited
and put into Troop or Company at the Officers cost. During this time there was a secret Intreague with Se∣cretary Ellis and Mr. Temple: As also a sham Letter from the Lord Tyrconel into England about delivering the Sword; and had there one been sent to demand the Sword with about a Thousand Soldiers, 'tis not doubted but it would be delivered, though at the same time the Lord Montjoy (least he should stand up for the Prote∣stants) is Complemented with an Embassy into France. And now the Irish getting all this time to strengthen themselves, and the Arms and Horses taken from the Protestants, they began to encrease to an Army of 90000. strong: And all this while there was neither Commission, Arms, Ammunition, or Money sent to the Protestants at Sligo, notwithstanding that as they were Informed, it was earnestly sollicited by a Person of Qua∣lity in England, who knew the goodness and strength of that Post they were in, and that they daily expect∣ed some Succours, so that the Protestants there began to be in very great want of Ammunition; and not∣withstanding all their endeavours, wanted many Arms, tho' all the fowling Pieces were cut into Carbines, and Smiths continually at work. And the Sword (to which the Supreme Acknowledgment is paid) was still unde∣manded in the Lord Tyrconnel's hand, and sure with∣out Command he would not lay it down; yet the Pro∣testants at Sligo continued in their own and Protestant Religions defence, according to their Declaration of the Fourth of January, without any violation of it, and kept constant Watch and Ward with the usual Exer∣cise against occasion offered, only on account of se∣veral Protestants who were stopt at Boile, and their Goods seiz'd by Colonel Mac Donel, who possest him∣self of my Lord Kingston's House there, and likewise on all the Corn and Hay of his Tenants near it. The
said Lord Kingston writ to the Colonel, desiring him to let the Protestants with their Goods come down, for he did not hinder any Papist to remove to him; which not being done, my Lord resolved to deliver those from their Restraints, and accordingly with a conside∣rable Party of Horse and Foot marched to Boile; but the Colonel hearing of my Lord's coming, drew in all his Men and Horses into my Lord's House and Court, and Capitulated, and let his Prisoners go; and enga∣ged on Honour not to hinder any from joyning at Sligo; but no sooner was my Lord and his Party gone, than the next day those that heard of that Engage∣ment, and were desirous to go thither, were all seized and kept close Prisoners till the Assizes— About this time, which was the 12th of March, the unlucky De∣claration (pardon the Expression) of the Second of February last, as being sent before any Army was Land∣ed to back it, and was there receiv'd, which gave time to all Papists to lay down their Arms and repair to their respective Dwellings by the 10th of April last, &c. which did so tye up all the Protestants from offering Violence, even to those who some time before stole their Cattel, that the least Violence was not offered them, in an absolute and intire Obedience to that De∣claration; by which means they were encouraged to have pardon for their Villanies and Robberies, and told by the Priests, Fryars and Officers, that no Army would be sent to suppress them: and therefore till the time li∣mited, they should let none know their Resolutions, whether to lay down, or stand to their Arms.— Also the French Marquess Dupont landing in Kinsale, and going to Dublin about this time, was splendidly enter∣tain'd there by the Lord Deputy, who assured him it would not be long till an Army Landed in Ireland out of France, as also of King James's going thither very
speedily, and a full account of what since hapned, which would not at all be credited by any Protestants, but that an Army would land out of England before any could come from France; but it was hoped the Marquess would not return back to France nor scape our Men at Sea — Intelligence being now receiv'd, and Account of the Army, and how Affairs stood, be∣ing sent back by Monsieur, it was judged expedient to march an Army with all speed to the North, and suppress the Protestants there. Accordingly an Army came to Lisnegarvy which (after a little Dispute, a great number of their Men falling on a small Party of ours) made them quit their Ground.— The noise of this Vi∣ctory soon took wing, and gave them encouragement to Besiege Colerain; and not being able to do any Exe∣cution on that side, drew off their Men to march them back to get over the Bridge above it, and so fall on that Town from the other side of the River, on which Colerain wanting trusty and good Officers in it to Com∣mand, the Rabble with the Inhabitants deserted and left the Town, (excepting only those that resolved to submit to the Enemy) by which means, and the great disorder they were in to get to Derry, many a good Horse and Arms, as well as the Riches of that Town, fell into the Enemies hands.— Notice of these Disasters being immediately sent from Derry by Colonel Lundee to the Gentlemen, who kept Garrisons in their Houses in the Counties of Monaghan, Cavan, &c. who were earnestly desired to draw down immediately with their Men, and joyn Derry Men; and understanding the Condition Derry was in, marcht forthwith: And lest the Enemy should possess themselves of their strong Houses, Goods, and Provisions, set fire to all, and marcht away by the light of it; consuming their own Goods and Houses, to joyn with Derry Men, and op∣pose
the Enemies marching thither to besiege it. And though it might be judged, the Loyalty and Zeal of these Gentlemen need not be question'd; yet hitherto there is but small Provisions made for them. And if it be asked what made them come over, 'tis easily answe∣red, the Divisions in Derry amongst several there, (who hitherto have scaped being called to account for it, may be fear'd, were private Instruments) and who took on them the Command, and ordered Matters as they themselves pleased, taking no advice but that of their own Pleasures, gave such plain occasion of distrust, that it was judged better by those and other honest Gentlemen there, to come over and give an Account how matters were, than to stay in disorder and Con∣fusion, when especially they were not able to stem the Current that so violently run against them, and whose business it was to joyn and assist with the Governour, rather than to give him publick opposition, when pri∣vate Advice proved vain; so that as well to avoid mu∣tinying with him, as to bring a Calumny on themselves, to be so much as suspected for betraying that Interest and Religion they were not able to defend or pre∣serve, the Rabble being in Confusion, who sometime would have one, another day another Officer; and some∣time would joyn themselves, and do as they pleased. The one part of Protestants deserting the other, and these not able to withstand the Enemy without mutual assistance; and if they could, not daring to trust their Governour, who was there (as well as he had been at Colerain) when they were about seizing him, and shut the Gates on him that he should not get away, till by his Oaths of Fidelity to them, (which he freely gave) and a little Policy, he got off; and being under vehe∣ment Suspicions of a private Correspondence with King James, who about this time was in Dublin, had
created such great Jealousies, Feuds and Heart burnings in the Soldiers, he refusing to give the Command to him chosen by the People: which was of no small Ad∣vantage to the Enemy, and daily weakned the Town, by the Desertion of those who durst neither trust him, nor themselves under his Command. During these disorders, Letters came to Sligo by Ex∣presses one after another from the Colonel, desiring my Lord Kingston to send a Party to join them at Derry. But answer being immediately return'd him, that there were not men enow at Sligo to keep that Post (so far from all re∣lief and) in the Face of the Enemy, and of the want there was of Arms and Ammunition (which were then at Der∣ry to be had for Money.) Every Officer for himself and Men, sent for so many as they wanted, according to their Proportions, and made a Purse, and thought it convenient to send Captain Coote forthwith to acquaint them with the state of the Garrison and know theirs; — and bring Arms and Ammunition, which were very much want∣ing; — whilst another Letter came posting, to de∣sire a speedy joining them at Derry. But a Council being call'd, it was resolved to stay till Captain Coote returned and brought the certainty how Matters were, and not to quit that advantageous Post lightly, which cost so much Money and Work to strengthen it, and had so many Men, Women and Children, that had from almost all parts of Connaght flockt to it, and could not get room, nor be provided for at Derry; and above all, was so considera∣ble to awe all Connaght Forces, that in case of Hard∣ships, Succours could come by Sea, which were now daily expected by every blast of an Easterly Wind, which was heartily wish'd and greedily long'd for. But streight a third Express was suddenly hastened, shewing the great Danger the North was in; and if that were lost, (as it was feared, without Sligo-Forces joining them, it would)
that Sligo could not hold out long after, and earnestly desired to desert it; and that he had provided Quarters and Forrage ready for them there, and come immediate∣ly to their relief. On which Express another Council was held, and knowing the great want there was of Ammuni∣tion (not much above one Barrel of Powder being in the Garrison at Sligo,) and the Danger that threatned them at Derry, it was resolv'd to join them forthwith, and quit Sliego, and to put all to the short Issue of one Field-Fight. Accordingly all now resolved to march with Bag and Baggage. The next day was spent in providing Horses and Necessaries, in getting Boats, breaking the big Guns, and sending of the small to Derry by Water; burning and destroying all the Corn, Hay, and Haggards about the Country; calling in all the Frontier Garri∣sons; — and every one using his utmost endeavours (some by Water to the Island of Enishmorrey, that was judged capable of defence till the Goods and Men could get off by Water to Derry,) the rest with what Horses they could get: so that the day following all marched; and a Vessel lying then at Sligo, as many as could get off, with some Goods, the Wind being fair, sailed away. But after two daies March (in the saddest Weather that could blow,) coming to Belashannon, 20 miles from Sli∣go, a fourth Letter comes to my Lord, to stay him there till Quarters were provided for him, and Forrage got for Horses; which was no small surprize, after drawing him from his Post, on Assurance of providing those neces∣saries, and of the distress that threatned Derry. A Boat also with Passengers and Goods from Sligo was cast away near Donigale, and another sent with the Field∣pieces, by reason of the Storm put into an Island, and the next day seiz'd and taken back, as were all the Goods, Provisions, Men, and Women that went into the Island, which was no small Booty. — But now was my Lord
Kingston forced, for want of Forrage, to disperse his Men, some to Beleeke, some to Donigale, some to Kil∣labegs (to keep Boylagh men in Awe, who were extream∣ly increased, and began to rob publickly on Barnesmore,) some at Belashannon, and some about the County; and so continued for seventeen days in a very ill condition for want of Forrage, many of the Horses being turned to Grass for want of it, and the Weather continuing extreamly bad; which so abused them, that many were made unserviceable. — At length a Letter comes from the Colonel to my Lord to Belashannon about ten at night, to secure the Pass at Ballymofey (30 Miles thence) by ten next day, which was altogether impossible to be done; — neither could it be (under half that time) that the men could have notice of it sent them, as they lay scattered in their several Quarters, which formerly I mentioned; and many were likewise to provide Horses, their own being dead, or so weak and out of Condition for want of Forrage, that they were of little use for Service: However two Companies that were at and near Donnigale, march'd in the Morning betime to join the Northern Men, and to secure that Pass, which was 20. Miles from them, and many hundreds of Men, Women and Children march'd with them, with Bag and Baggage in hopes to get to Derry before the Enemy intercepted them; but this day being dismally wet, and extream windy, and marching over that horrible Mountain of Barnesmore, which is 15 miles long, tho' they marched at an extraordinary rate, yet it was seven at night before they could reach it; and my Lord (expecting to meet Colonel Lundy there) rid with a dozen Horse, to dis∣course him, and to know why he was drawn from his Post on pretence of so great danger? why he kept there in that bad condition so long after he had receiv'd his Letter, that Quarters and Forrage was provided for him
and his Party? why he had not notice sooner sent him of the Enemies approaching so near? and how was it possible for him to march his Men, who lay scattered at such a distance, under at least three daies notice? but coming thither, there was soon an account given by those, who that day were broke and fled from Cladyford Fight, that the Colonel, with the Horse whom he com∣manded to go with him to secure a Pass on the River above Cladyford, was gone to Derry; and it was not much questioned but the Enemy, who soon fell into Rapho, killing Men in the very Streets there, would be as soon at the Gate, and enter, as the Colonel.— And it is not much to be doubted, that had the Irish Army Liberty of getting over that Ford, which they could not possibly do, without great danger of their Lives, the Water being so very high with that days rain, and the Bridge being broken down, that if they could have marched over and pursued their Victory, they would have got in without great (if any) opposition; for Colonel Cunningham, with the Succours sent by him for the relief and defence of the Town, had set sail, and reurned: and it was not doubted but Derry as well as Colerain, would be left to them by the Colonel, in re∣gard that neither Men nor Arms were landed:— And now this Party thus disappointed at Ballemofey, and the Enemy in Rapho between them and Derry, after this days sad March, were now forced to return that night, over that wild Mountain; and Horses being weak and weary with the long March and bad weather, could not get back that night, but were left with Loads and all: So that by much difficulty, and by the great care the two Companies of Foot (who brought up the Rear) took to bring off the Women and Chil∣dren, who were sadly toiled and tired, many of them would have been left and lost, as almost all their Goods
and Baggage were. — And next Morning got back to Donigale, with much difficulty and distress, by reason of the badness of the Weather, as well as that of the way, and the Darkness, Windiness, and Rain, contribu∣ting not a little to the Hazards and Losses they sustain∣ed. — And now consulting what was to be done in these Disorders, or rather treacherous Practices, it was concluded that my Lord Kingston (with the Officers of his appointment that were there with him) should come off in three or four Vessels that lay at Killabeggs, and hasten over and give an account how matters were, and get Commissions and return with all speed to their Friends, Relations and Tenants, whom they mounted and armed and sent straight to joyn Eniskillin Men; which was no small trouble to them, that after about four months cost, sufferings, and acquaintance, they must now part, having neither Arms, Ammunition, nor Supplies sent them: but it was now plain, that the Co∣lonel (who knew very well that King James was near his Army) which gave clear occasions of distrust, and that the private under-hand intelligence he held would be to the ruin of the Protestants; and the day after the Lord Kingston, the wind being fair, set sail. But to relate the miseries and hardships they endured at sea, lying a Ship-board like packt Herrings in their Boots and wet Cloaths for six or seven days, and twice like to be cast away on the Scotch Shoar; and thence getting to Glas∣gow in small Boats, some again riding post to London with my Lord, others going to Edinburgh, and then by Sea, some afoot to Leverpool above 200 miles, others again venturing, thither by Sea, who ever since have been waiting, petitioning, and expecting to return with Commissions for themselves as well as for some of their Friends, who have given the World satisfaction of their Courage and Zeal for the Protestant Religion, and whose Names ought to be honoured with a perpetual
Remembrance of their Actions. And if the Archbishop of Tuam or Bishop of Killalla, who very well knows my Lord, with the Gentlemen that came over with him, and what they did and suffered whilst they were at Sligo, be enquired of the truth of this matter, that certainly per∣sons who are provided for, and who never shewed that Zeal would not be preferred, and these (not only neg∣lected, by which means they suffer many hardships, but) even discountenanced, by being called Deserters of their Country; and whether this usage be not a Trial of their Zeal, I leave to any one to judge: also on due en∣quiry, or after what is said, if they for coming over, or the Person who drew them from their Post, who by their Majesties Commission, was Governour of Derry, and who hazarded their Lives and Fortunes to join with him, without Commissions to oppose the Enemy, to be so served, or he be most to blame?— Or whether they who know the Mountains, Creeks and Passes, as well as the notorious bloody Rebels and Cow-stealers, who have most of their nearest Relations, either ha∣zarding their Lives against them, or under their Pow∣er, at least in restraint, with cruel usage and hardships enough, if they have yet escaped with their Lives: whe∣ther also that these Gentlemen, who have left their Goods, and come over, some with a very little Money, Plate, or other Moveables of value, which is now all spent; and some who have a great Charge of eight or ten in Family, who in probability might have starved many of them, had not that charitable Course been taken for their support; that is, who cannot raise Money here for want of City-secu∣rity; neither their own (tho they have good Estates in Ireland) nor the Gentlemen thence to be taken bound for them; whether, I say, these be able to return for want of Horses, Arms, or Necessaries to carry them over, having spent all, and to carry a Musket, and leave their Families in want, and wholly unsettled and wanting Bread, would
not only be bad encouragement for them, but that Pay would neither maintain them, nor scarce any one of their Familie; and whether a due consideration and regard be not to be had of those so quallified for Employments, and Persons of known Courage and Zeal for the Protestant Religion, of whom there are many unprovided for of a∣ny Employment, which would be a great ease to England in the several Sums paid for the Relief of those Prote∣stants, who are now here in no capacity nor ability for providing for themselves, tho they are sufficiently zea∣lous for their Majesties Service. And whether a farther delay may not be prejudicial as Matters stand, considering that for want of a speedy relieving of Ireland, and not sending over but about 100. Officers, and one to Command in Chief with Arm, Ammunition, Commissions, and Money in Ja∣nuary, February, March, or April last, that Kingdom had not been wholly in the Protestants hands, notwith∣standing all the French Army since Landed, as well as that raised by Tyrconnel, and if it had not prevented the ruin, Destruction, Desolation, and Cruelties, which the Protestants there have since suffered? And now 'tis hoped it may not be amiss to inspect and enquire who the Retarders are; and to do it so effectu∣ally, that they at length be frustrated of carrying on any farther Designs, to the Apparent ruin of the Pro∣testants, and to bring them to Condign Punishments for the Blood and Miseries many Thousands have suffe∣red by the Irish and French Cruelties, who were the Instruments who occasion'd it. And whether they did not endeavour by such Practices to Establish Popery, as well as Confusion. May they therefore be found out and made Exam∣ples for their Perfidy. May their Sacred Majesties ever be happy and defend the Protestant Reli∣gion from Popery and Superstition, and have the
Hearts of all their Subjects intirely united to them, whilst all Ackitophels justly suffer. May England with all their Majesties Kingdoms and Dominions flourish under Peace and Safety, whilst we Bless God for his great Deliverances he wrought for us, in Placing their Majesties on the Royal Throne. May the Poor Pro∣testants of Ireland Bless the Almighty, who they hope hath raised a Deliverer for them, that they may return in Peace to enjoy their Possessions; that they may make the right and Sanctified use of their Afflictions, so that they and their Children may never forget the great Deliverances wrought for them: Whilst the Irish and French be turned out of that Land, and receive their just demerits, and that Religion and true Piety, may ever flourish and be establish'd among us for all Generati∣ons. And may Duke Schomberg have this also added to his former Renowned Acts, to prove the Deliverer, first of the Irish Protestants, and then of the French in France. FINIS. Books lately Printed for Ric.
