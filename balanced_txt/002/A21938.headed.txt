❧ By the Queene. The Queenes Maiesties Proclamation, declaring her Princely intention to inhibite her Subiects vpon most extreme paynes from offending on the Seas, any persons in their Ships or goods, being the Subiectes of any Prince, Potentate or State, in Amitie with her Maiestie. THe Queenes Maiestie vnderstanding of some complaints made against certaine of her Subiects, who go to the Seas with Letters of Reprisal to recouer recom∣pence of the King of Spaines subiects for the notable iniuries and losses by arrests and other barbarous cruelties committed in Spaine and Portingale against them and many others (whereof no remedie could euer be had by order of Iustice) should vnder colour of seeking to recouer the proper goods of the Spaniards, both take the Ships and goods of diuers subiects of other Princes and States being in Amitie with her Maiestie: Although all such courses haue bene euer odious to her Maiestie, and alwayes seuerely punished, whensoeuer any such things haue bene duely prooued: Yet her Maiestie whose care is infinite to preserue Iustice, as one of the maine pillars of her Estate, whereof not onely her owne conscience is sufficient testimonie, but all her actions (if they be duely considered) haue left sufficient proofe of the same: Hath commanded both her priuie Counsell and the Lord high Admirall of England, with all other the officers of her Ports and marine causes, to cause the trueth of all these generall complaints to be heard and examined with all expedition: And as they shall be found true, to see both restitution and full recompense to bee made to her friends subiects, that are dam∣nified: And the offendours to bee grieuously punished, as farre foorth as the nature of their offences might deserue. And for further proofe of her Maiesties Princely meaning in this case towards all Kings, Princes and States in Amitie with her Maiestie, Shee declareth her intention to be, (and so commandeth it to be executed) That if any person whatsoeuer shall vpon the Seas take any Ships that doe belong to any subiects of her friends and allies with whom shee is in Amitie, and after knowledge had that the sayd Ships doe belong to her friends, doe not forbeare to stay them, or shall take out of them any goods belonging to her sayd friends, shall suffer death, with confiscation of lands and goods. And forasmuch as her Maiestie is infourmed of some com∣plaints that some of her Marchants ships trading aswell into the Straights as to other places in league and Amitie with her Highnesse, being strongly furnished (as reason is they should be) for the defence of themselues against the violence of the enemies, should also offend and endamage her Maiesties good friends vpon the Seas, vnder colour of taking the subiects of the Spanish King: Her Maiestie straightly chargeth and commandeth all her louing Subiects for preuention of any such suspicion hereafter, that none of them shall send to the Seas any ships by way of trade or traffike, but they shall also enter into bond before the Lord high Admirall of Eng∣land or his officers, to the full value of his ship, furniture and victuall, that the company of that ship shall not of∣fend, indammage, hurt, rob, or spoyle any ship or vessel of any her Highnes sayd friends or allies, vnder paine of confiscation of such ships as shal be sent to the seas before such bonds so entred. And to the intent that all persons may vnderstand with what conditions all persons seruing on the Seas against the Spaniards are licensed, her Maiestie hath commanded that the very condition of the parties bonds that are licensed, shall be annexed to this Proclamation: the which being duely obserued (as her Maiesties meaning is it should be) her Maiestie doubteth not but her actions shall be thought consonant to Honor and Iustice, and to the allowance of her friends and al∣lies,
leauing the false callumniations of her enemies, and the auenge of their  disturbance of the common peace of Christendome to the iudgement of Almightie God, to whose wisedome and power it onely belongeth.
