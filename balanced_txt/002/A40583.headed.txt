The Full and True RELATION Of a Dreadful Storm or Tempest Accompanied with Thunders, Lightnings, and Hail-stones, some of them being above Two pounds in weight: As likewise a terrible Earthquake, continuing for above half an hour, giving three furious onsets, the which hapned on the 16th of August 1680, in the City of Millain, and the Villages adjacent; so that in the space of Three hours and a half, it quite demolished Twenty state∣ly Houses, and ruined about one hundred and fifty more, and greatly Endamaged Two Churches, by blowing off their Steeples, and unleading them. As likewise An Account of Barns and Reeks fired by Lightning, Trees blown up by the Roots, and Villages adjacent destroyed; with about Sixty persons killed, and a Hundred wounded, besides a number of Cattle that perished: the like not having been known to happen: The Damages sustained upon view of several worthy persons, being granted to be One Million and a half. With several other Remarkable Accidenrs (strange and dreadful) as they were faithfully transmitted by a person of worth, who was upon view of the sad accident, and gave his report as to the losses sustained. WHen angry Heaven designs to punish man for Disobedience, and to make him know he is but dust, sundry means are used; and wise Om∣nipotence fore-warns before he strikes, or gives his venge∣ance reins to overwhelm with ruine irrevocable the Sons of Men: for sure it is, Divine Justice is always tempered with Mercy, and many times some fall, to give the rest an op∣portunity
for to repent, and so avoid the danger imminent, which otherwise would fall heavy on their heads: And truly through all Ages it has been observed, that the Almigh∣ty has been loath to destroy the work that his right hand has formed; for as the holy Psalmist does declare, that lowd Thunder is his voice among the waters, so may it be under∣stood, that Tempests and Earthquakes are his warning-pieces, and as Heralds, gives us notice of wrath designed to fall; of which more dreadful has not happened, than what I shall here relate, which happened in the City of Millain, and the Vil∣lages adjacent, on the 16th of August, 1680, the Circum∣stances of which are as followeth. About Noon an unusual paleness over-cast the Sun, and all the Clouds seemed of a white Amber-colour, their motions being many times contrary to the Winds, that about Three of the clock in the Afternoon began to blow strong from the North-West, when on a suddain, it Thundered, and darted Lightning so swift, as made the Heavens seem all on fire, whilst a gathering blackness made it seem as night, that peo∣ple could not discern each other, so as to be known the space of six yards; which put all to a great amazement, and caused them to imagine that Dooms-day was at hand: but long their wonder had not lasted, ere from the breaking Clouds a storm of Hail descended, the stones of which were of such Magnitude, as has not been seen in any Age, many of them weighing two pounds or more; which surprizing many in the fields, and other places shelterless, killed them in a mo∣ment, whilst in vain they strove to fly, and Cattle without number perished; all the Fruit-trees and others were broken in pieces for the space of forty miles, as if they had been bat∣tered with Cannon-Bullets, or the Branches torn with vio∣lent hands: nor fared the City and Villages much better, for in many places the Spires were beaten off Church-steeples, the Leads broken through, and all the Ornaments therein quite spoyled; whilst the Houses went to wrack, scarce either Tiles or Slates being left upon them, but loosened or broke off by the furious Storm, they were by the violence of the winds
carried like Leaves in the Air, far distant from their proper places; stacks of Chimneys likewise being blown down, whose fall demolished several stately Buildings; so that the wretched people in amazement knew not where to fly for safety, but as they strove to avoid one danger, fell soul of another as great if not greater than the former; for leaving their ruined Houses, in the open streets the Hail was worse, and the Storm raged more, accompanyed with hot flashes of Lightning, and volleys of Thunder, so prodigious loud as was never heard before; so that multitudes being struck down, lay sprawling and crying for help in vain; each one preferring his safety before that of his friends. Whilst this was doing, several Barns and Reeks of Corn and Hay near adjoyning to the City, took fire, supposed to be done by Lightning, whose Flames, notwithstanding all the Rain and Hail, burnt fierce, and being carried with the wind, whole sheets of that devouring Element were hurled in the Air, not without greatly endangering the Churches and Buil∣dings on that side the City. The Storm and great Confusion having continued for the space of three hours, Rending and Tearing what e'r opposed it, immediately an unusual Portent more dangerous, began to assault the tottering Ruines: for whether caused by the violence of the Tempest, or Whirlwinds inclosed in Natures Caverns, is not certain; but certain it is, the Earth began to Tremble more and more, till at last it fell into so terrible a shaking fit, as made the Buildings skip like Rams, and the People stagger as if drunk, that nothing but Confusions and Amazements were spread among them, whilst the Crying Children followed their woful Parents, for to shelter them from Heavens wrath, which the angry Skies sent down. The Earthquake gave Three several onsets, which each time in∣creased so, that the last seemed to have unhinged all Nature, and to have overturned her deep Foundations, the like ne∣ver having been in any of these parts before. It continued for half an hour or somewhat more, doing infinite damage to those Buildings the Storm had loosened; so that above
Twenty fell flat to the ground, and about one hundred and fifty spoiled and ruined, that they must be quite plucked down; besides a number, almost numberless, that received less damage, though very considerable. The two Churches on the West-side, have almost all the Lead blown off them, and their Steeples half way blown down: Nor are the Villages less ruined, though they lye much lower, and are in several places sheltred with small ri∣sing Hills, and high-grown Trees; but Trees availed them not, for they, as well as Barns, Hay-reeks, Corn-reeks, and Houses, were torn up by the Roots, some of them being tos∣sed up in the Air, and made the sport of winds. After the continuance of almost four hours, on a sudden all was whist and still; which put some into a great admiration, which might have been spared, had they considered what the Holy Scriptures saith, That both Winds and Waves, and all Created things obey, and at the voice of God desist to rage. The next morning being very fair, several went to view the Ruines, and take a particular account of the Damages done, as well in the City as other Villages; which they found to be very great, and that the loss and spoil of Hay, Corn, and Cattle onely, amounted to half a Million; and the Da∣mages the Churches, Houses, Out-houses, and Barns had sustained at the lowest value, about one Million more. It is said there was about Sixty persons killed, and about a hun∣dred wounded, with the fall of Hail, Tiles, Stones, and Timber. Several persons of great Quality have come to be Spectators of our devastations, and with admiration bless themselves, to see how many goodly Structures are demolished and de∣faced; and all conclude never to have beheld the like; so that it was thought fit by all our Magistrates, that a publick Fast should be Solemnized here at all the Churches, thereby to appease the wrath of Heaven, and intreat him with sup∣plications to turn away his conceived displeasure; which was accordingly performed on the 18th of the instant before-mentioned, with great Observance and Solemnity.
