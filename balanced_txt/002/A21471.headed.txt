THe Kyng our soueraygne lorde / of his hyghe prudence and wysdome. Consideryng / howe that aswell in the tymes of his noble progenitours / kynges of this his realme of Englande / as also in the tyme of his most noble reygne / by the exercisyng and vsyng of his and their subiectes in shotyng in longe bowes / there dyd insurge / en∣creace and growe within the same realme / great nombre and multitude of franke Archers / whiche nat onely therby defended this his said realme and subiectes therof / against the malyce and daungers of their enemyes / but also with a meane & small nombre and puissaunce / in regarde and comparison of their enemyes / hath done many notable exploites and actes of warre / to the discomfiture of their said enemyes. By reason whereof / aswell our sayd souerygne lorde the kyng / as also his noble progenitours / haue had and optayned great and tryumphant victories / against their enemyes / to the great honour / fame / renowme / and suretye of his and their noble {per}sons / and of this his said realme of Englande / and subiectes of the same / as also to the terryble feare and drede of all outwarde and straūge nacions / attemptyng any thing by the waye of hostilyte / to the hurt or daunger of this his said realme.
