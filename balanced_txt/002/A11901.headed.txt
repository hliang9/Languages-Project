LUCIUS, ANNAEUS, SENECA THE PHILOSOPHER: HIS BOOKE OF THE Shortnesse of LIFE. Translated into an ENGLISH Poem. Multum ille ad bonam mentem profecit, cuj Seneca placere caepit. Lipsius. Imprinted at London for Daniel Frere, at the red Bull in little Britaine. 1636.
TO THE LEARNED AND Iudicious, Sir Henry Wotton. Sir, YOur Approbation of some wandring Papers, brought casually to your sight, and whisper'd to be mine, inuites me to owne this, and send it a∣broad secur'd by the Safe Conduct of Your Iudgment: I ven∣ture to transforme a Stoick into one of the Muses, to reduce to Harmony a rigid peice of Philosophy; and because an Imperiall Envy, and therefore the highest, (that which de∣sign'd the suppression of Homer, Virgil, and Livie,) censur'd the Authors Workes, to be but Arena sine calce, I have without any violence knit up His short Booke of the Shortnes of Life, into a naturall Poem; which may bee thus farre usefull, that the Readers memory may retaine his Acute and Redundant witt with more facillity: I make the addresse to you, thereby to prefixe a President, that wisely spins out this narrow Thread of Life in the way prescrib'd; which Remarkeable Example (that being all the Addition I make) must needs contribute no small vi∣gour to the Precepts of Seneca. R. F.
In Senecae de brevitate vitae Librum Elegan∣tissime Translatum. OBstruitur tanto mortalis vita dolore, Taedeat ut longae semita ducta viae. Tam suavis Senecae stilus, et Translatio libri Vt placeat multas ferre relecta vices Esse brevem cuperem misero sub tempore vitam Sed longum vitae de brevitate librum. G. A. Metaphrasti Dignissimo. TO Translate Seneca, and to obserue His Brevity, and from his sence not swerue, Require's a Learned Iudgement ev'n in Prose; But him in Verse to render, and yet lose Neither his Quicknes, nor his Eloquence, Shew's both great Skill and our Tongu's Excellence; Thus by this happy Version may we see, That the Acutest Prose is Poetry, And may beleeve that Seneca' as in name Both Poet and Philosopher's the same.

L. A. SENECA OF THE Shortnes of Life. MOst men (Paulinus) make it Natures crime, That we are borne to a small part of time, Which doth so speedily, so swiftly run, That life with most is in the entrance done; Nor doe the Rude and Ignorant alone Vnder this common conceiv'd evill groane; But it hath drawne (out of an inward sence) Complaints from men of greatest Eminence; Hence did the chiefe Physitian exclaime, That Art is long, Life short to learne the same; And Aristotl' expostulate with Nature (More then a Wiseman ought) to the brute creature As most indulgent, since some kind appeares To live five hundred, some a thousand yeares, Whilst man to High and Noble things design'd Is to a farre lesse terme of life confin'd. The time we have's not short; but much we lose, Our life, if of the whole we well dispose, Is long enough, and of a large extent To bring great things to their accomplishment: But when it is not vertuously imploy'd▪ But with excesse or idlenes destroy'd▪ Death vs at length surprising, life is spent Before we have perceived how it went;
Life is not given, but made short; nor poore Can we be said, but prodigall of store; For as great Riches falling in the power Of a lewd Spend-all vanish in an houre, And meanes though small, committed to the care Of a good Husband, soone increased are; So life well us'd is long enough; Why then Is Nature charg'd to have dealt ill with men? Some to infatiat Auarice are bent; Others to fruitlesse labours are intent; This drenched is with Wine; that, dull'd with Sloth, This mans ambiton leaves him to the Wrath And will of others; that, in hope of gaine Seekes Lands, and Seas his Traficke to maintaine; Some take delight in Warre, busy'd about Other mens Ruines, while their owne they doubt; Some into willing servitude are brought, Which an ingrate dependency hath wrought; Many doe either earnestly affect Other mens fortunes, or their owne neglect; Most, unresolv'd whereto themselves t' apply, Through vaine and selfe displeasing levity Fall still upon new proiects; some againe Misliking every course of life, remaine Yawning till death; so that, what hath beene said And as an Oracle delivered By that great Poet, we for truth may give, 'Ts the least part of Life that wee doe live: The rest is onely Time not Life; they're ty'd
And compassed by vice on every side, They cannot raise themselves, nor lift their eyes To behold truth, and from their strong Lusts rise; They never will find leasure to retire Into themselves; or if some good desire They chance to have, 'tis like, but at the best The Sea, that though Winds cease, is not at rest; Their passions will afford them noe repose; Nor would I have thee thinke I speake of those Notoriously bad; they whom the World Calls happy, are into like evils hur'ld; How many mens great Riches have beene found An heauy weight to presse them to the ground? Many to boast their Eloquence so strayne Themselues, they dye by Rupture of a Veine? How many have we seene grow pale and wan With their continuall pleasures? many a man Compass'd with troopes of Suiters, is thereby Deprived quite of his owne liberty; Nay run through all degrees; one goes to law, Another Pleades the cause; this stands in awe Of Power which threatens death, that him defends An other will be Iudge, and make them friends; But none doth to himselfe himselfe redeeme; We mutually are wasted; those that seeme Of greatest note, doe with a fond respect Court one another, and themselves neglect; It is a folly therefore beyond Sence, When great men will not give us Audience To count them proud; how dare we call it pride
When we the same have to our selves deny'd Yet they how great, how proud so ere, have bin Sometimes so courteous as to call thee in, And heare thee speake; but thou couldst nere afford Thy selfe the leasure of a looke or word▪ THou shouldst not then here in another blame, Because when thou thy selfe do'st doe the same Thou wouldst not be with others, but we see Plainely, thou canst not with thine owne selfe be; Not all the wits that are, should they conspire, This humane blindnes could enough admire; They will have none to meddle with their Farmes, And if their bounds be question'd are in Armes; But yet will suffer others to incroach Vpon their lives, and to their great reproach, They will not sticke officiously to call Such as will at the length be Lords of all; To share his money no man can abide; Their lives twixt many all men will devide; In keeping their Estate strict care they use; But, come t' expence of time, th'are most profuse; Of what alone (though in it selfe a vice) Is an especiall vertue, Avarice; With some old man let's thus expostulate; Thou hast, we see, run through lifes umost date, Attain'd perhaps, an hundred yeares or more, But tell us now; how much from that great store Thy Creditor hath got, thy Mistris, Friend, Thy Clients, or the Iarre (that hath no end)
Betweene thy wife and thee? how much is spent In chastising thy Slaves? in Complement, And Visits through the towne? adde here the cure Of maladies, thou didst thy selfe procure, Time lost in doing nothing; and behold Thou hast farre fewer yeares then thou hast told: Consider well what day hath beene imploy'd As thou determin'st, how thou hast enioy'd Thy selfe, or hast beene constant to thy ends, Kept thy mind right, what good thine age pretends T'have ever done, how many have bereav'd Thee of thy life when thou hast not perceiv'd, When foolish ioy, vaine hope, greedy desire, And flattering company their shares require, But a small part will to thy selfe belong, And then thou must confesse thou dyest yong. BVt what's the cause? we live, as if for ever We were to live, minding our frailties never? We husband not our time, but let it fly As if we had a Store-house to supply, When as perhaps, that day set to be past Vpon that thing, or man, will be our last; As Mortall, all things sordidly we feare, And as Immortall, our Ambitions reare: At fifty Yeares some say they will retire, And at threescore beleeve they shall desire To quit their offices: but who can give Assurance, that we shall to that time live T'effect our purpose? what vain thought us driues
To give our selves the Reliques of our lives; And that time onely unto goodnesse lend, That otherwise we know not how to spend? That man hath certainly too late begun To live, that onely lives when life is done; What madnesse is it to defer our rest. Till fifty 'or threescore yeares? and thinke it best Then to begin our life, when onely some, And perhaps few, will unto that age come? The greatest Princes oft have words let fall Wherein they wish, commend, prefer 'bove all A quiet life; and (might it safely bee) Would be content to quit their dignity For though no outward danger should assaile, Yet fortune will against her selfe prevaile. DIvine Augustus (t'whom the Gods gave more Then any mortall man) would oft deplore The misery that waites upon a Crowne, And still desire to lay the burthen downe, His chiefe discourse to this did ever tend, That in a privat life his cares should end; This hope, though vaine, did sweete contentment give, That at the length he to Himselfe should live: In an Epistle to the Senate sent, Where he desir'd to let them know, hee ment That his so often mentioned retreat, Should be with reservation of his state, Such words I find. But these things rather ought Be done, then said; yet so farre hath the thought.
Of that wisht time prevaild, that though the glad Fruition of the thing hee yet not had, Yet I, in the discourse I thereof make Doe in the meane time no small pleasure take: So did he value rest, that when he could Not compasse it in deede, in thought he would; He that saw all depend upon his will, And unto men and Nations, good or ill Gave as he list, thought gladly on that day Wherein his greatnesse he should put away; He found what secret cares, and how much sweat Such farre-renowned Honour did beget; When first by Citizens, by Collegues next, And lastly by his Kindred deepely vext, He was compeld (so powerfully withstood) By land and Sea, to try it out with blood; Through Macedonia, Aegypt, Cicily, Through Asia, Syria, and the coast thereby He led his Armies forth to forraigne warrs Weari'd with slaughter in our Roman iarres; While he the Alpes appeas'd, did such reduce As in the Empire liv'd in doubtfull truce; While beyond Rhene, Danubius, Euphrates, He did his bounds remove, in midst of these Great acts, in Rome it selfe did Lepidus, Muraena, Caepio, and Egnatius Whet all their Swords against him; and before This threatning danger he had well past ore, His daughter, with so many Nobles bound B'Adultry, as by vow, sought to confound
His yet unbroken age; that once more hee Might feare a woman with her Anthony: And though these ulcers with the members two, He quite cut off, yet others quickly grew; So bodies still breake out, that are opprest With too much blood; he therefore sought for rest; There dwelt his thoughts, to that his hopes aspir'd, That could give others all that they desir'd. When Cicero by the malitious fewde Of Catalines, and Clodians persude, By Pompey and Crassus greiv'd, those foes profest, These doubtfull friends, could not find any rest In the perplexed State, which he desir'd To save from ruine, he at length retir'd; No lesse inconstant in adversity Then he was active in prosperity; His Consulship that he did so commend, Though not without a cause, yet without end, How did he then detest? what heavinesse Writing to Atticus did he expresse? Old Pompey vanquisht, and his Sonne in Spaine, His broken troopes now gathering up againe, Dost thou demand what I doe heere? (quoth hee) In Tusculanum I remaine halfe free: He further addes where he bewailes time past, Condemnes the present, and despaires at last Of what's to come; did Cicero but call Himselfe halfe free? a Wise man never shall Descend so low; but halfe he cannot be, Vnbound, intirely himselfe, hee's wholy free;
For being above fortune, nothing can Be ever thought to be above that man. WHen Livius Drusus one of a bold spirit, Did strive the Grachi's mischiefe, to inherit And to obtrud new Lawes, followed by all Th' Italian rout, scarce weighing what might fall, Finding no hope to compasse his designe, Which he with safety could not then decline, He curs'd his life, who (as he oft would say) Was th' onely boy that nere had leave to play; He durst presume though yet but one of those, That wore the Robe of Youth, to interpose For guilty men, and in such earnest sort That he did many sentences extort; What would not that ambition undergoe? Such forward impudence brings certaine woe, Private and publique; therefore he too late Complain'd of want of play-daies, whom the state And Iustice, from a boy pernitious found; Some thought he slew himselfe, for of a wound Peircing his Groyne he dyde, the means unknown, But the act thought unseasonable by none. Twere vaine to speake of more, whom vulgar fame Hath happy call'd, since selfe-convincing shame Their whole life past hath taught them to condem; But these complaints nor others chang'd, nor them For though such words brak from them, yet the wil And the affections have remained still; A Life so led, although a thousand yeares,
Seemes to best raightned much and short appeares; Such things devoure an Age; though nature run Her course, lengthned by Art, yet life's soone done; For men observe not, nor give timely stay To what's most swift, but let it passe away As needlesse, or to be regain'd at pleasure; I name those first that can afford no leasure To any thing but Wine, and Lust, such time Is vildly spent: Others, although they climbe With a vaine glorious hope, more brauely' offend, The Couetous, the Wrathfull, they that bend Their actions to uniust revenge, or warre, Have more pretence, Their crimes more manly are, The sins of Lust are base; doe thou suruay The actions of most men, they spend the day Onely in counting money, plotting still How to deceive, or fearing the like ill, Giving or taking favours, waging law, Or making feasts, which custome now doth draw As duties on them, betweene good and bad They're so turmoyl'd, no breathing can be had; And 'tis confest by all; that they that dwell In too much businesse, can doe nothing well; Nor Eloquence, nor liberall Arts can find Any admittance, when the busied mind Not able to looke up, with care is cloyd, They that continually are so imployd, Doe nothing lesse then live, a thing discernd By very few, and hardly to bee learnd Of other Sciences, professors are
In every place; yea boyes have prou'd so rare They have beene teachers; but we must apply Even all our life to live, nay all to dye: Which many Wise men quitting both their trea∣sures Their worldly affairs, their offices, their pleasures, And ready to depart hence, have profest Not yet to know; how short then are the rest? We may (beleeve me) truely thinke a man Rais'd above humane errour, when he can So keepe his time, that it be shard by none; Life then is long, when it is all our owne. No part will to the owner uselesse be, Nor subiect to an others will; for he That knowes to husband time, think's nothing fit Nor worthy heere, to be exchang'd for it: He therefore hath enough, while they that spend It on the people, quickly find an end; Nor can we therefore thinke from hence that such Know not their losse, how many with too much Felicity opprest, amidst the Rout Of Suitors, their law cases, or about Some other honest misery, have cride That time to live was unto them denide? Which we may well beleeve, since all that make Vse of thy helpe, doe something from thee take; How much hath he whom thou defend'st? or hee That by thy helpe expects some dignity? Or that old Woman, that with clamour fils Thine eares, with proving many Husbands wills? How much hath hee that sicknesses doth faigne
And by deluding others hopes makes gaine? Or that great friend, by whom th'art onely sure; To be regarded as his Furniture? Recount (I say) thy daies, and thou shalt find Onely the reffuse to thy selfe assign'd: This gets the Consulship so much desir'd, And then askes when the yeare will be expir'd▪ That provids publique sports, obtain'd with large Expence, and straight growes weary of the charge: This Lawyer hurried to every barre By troupes of Suiters, with more causes farre Then can be heard, growne weary, doth pretend That he could wish the Terme were at an end; They their owne Lives precipitate, that both Desire things future, and the present loath; While he that suffers none his time to borrow, But makes each present day his life, the morrow, Nor feares, nor wishes; for what houre can bring New ioy to him, that knowing every thing Hath Master'd all his thoughts? let Fortune vse Her pleasure, he his constant life persues: Something may added be perchance, although Nothing diminished, but yet added so As Meate to a full stomacke, neither sought, Nor yet digested. Let none then be thought Old for their wrinckles, or gray-hairs, 'twere wrong To say hee liv'd, hee onely hath beene long: We cannot truely say that Ship hath saild, On which fierce stormes have from the port pre∣vaild, And driving too and fro, the voyage crost,
That hath not sayled much, but beene much tost: I oft have wondred with my selfe to heare, Some demand time, and others not forbeare To grant it straight, both looke upon the cause Why it is ask'd, the thing from neither drawes Regard, but as nothing were sought, or given; That which should be in most esteeme, is even A trifle made; the errour hence doth spring, Because it is an incorporeall thing, Not subiect to the sence, tis therefore brought Into contempt, or rather nothing thought. Our Great men yearly New-yeares Gifts receive, For which they give by way of contract leave To use their labour, diligence, and paines, That which costs onely time, is counted gaines: But if such once be sick, and think, Death neare How are Physitians hugg'd? or if they feare To loose their lives for some notorious crime, What bounteous offers are then made for time? So various are their thoughts; could men but tell The number of their yeares to come, as well As what are past, how would they then both make Spare of the one, and at the other quake? What certaine is (though small) we may devide; We must more wary be of what may slide So suddainly from us; nor can we suppose They know not what a precious thing they loose, Because when they their loves would most expresse, Part of their yeares to give, they will professe, They give, tis true, but so, that what they leave
Others, to whom they give, doe not receive, Nor they themselves take notice of the losse; A hidden damage seemes an easie crosse. But none thy yeares will render, none restore Thee to thy selfe; what order'd was before Must be continued in the course begun; Time gives no warning, but doth flyly run: Nor peoples favour, nor the Princes power Can alter, lengthen, or retard one houre; Thou busy'd art, life hastneth away, Death comes at length, and thou must needs obay. CAn any that to Wisedome would pretend, Be better busy'd, then to learne to mend His present life? it is a vaine pretence To thinke to order time, with times expence; And to defer our purpose, when we know, Life's greatest damage from delay doth grow. Th'expectance of an other daies event, Is nothing but a present detriment; For to omit a day, is to dispose Of what is fortunes, and our owne to lose: Why stay'st thou then? whereon dost thou relye? No future thing is sure; live presently. Heare how the Poet in a Rapture cries, Each best day first from wretched Mortalls flyes. Let's not deferre (said he) for if wee stay 'Tis gone, though we lay hold it runs away; We therefore of swift time swift use should make, And as it were from a quicke Torrent, take;
And to reprove our thoughts, he doth not say The best Yeare soonest flyes, but the best day; Why are we then so slow in such a Flight Of time, as if we could pretend a Right To Moneths, or Yeares, or to the longest date That our vast minds could ere desire of fate? He speakes but of a day now fleeting; then Why marvaile we, if wretched mortall men (That is, such as be buside) ever find Their best daies soonest gon, whose childish mind Age undiscern'd invades; for no man keepes Any accompt, by what degrees that creepes: As they, whom some tale told, or serious thought Deceiving, to their Iournies end are brought, Before they thinke them neere; so we that make This speedy Iourney' of Life, both while we wake And sleepe, by reason of our too much care, Doe find it done before we be aware. SHould I in parts devide what I propose, I easily then might prove the lives of those That so much mind the World, to be most short: Old Fabianus (none of that odde sort Of Chaire-philosophers, but Morrall, grave;) Was wont to say, that vices must not have A slight encounter, the'are (quoth he) our Swords, That must repell such Enemies, not words; Yet that men may their errours more refraine, 'Ti better to instruct, then to complaine, These three degrees of time make up lifes summe,
What is, what was, and what is yet to come, The present transient is, and cannot last, The future doubtfull; onely what is past Is certaine: fortune heere all right doth lose, Not any other can thereof dispose; This Worldly men have lost, nor can they find Leasure enough, their former deedes to mind; Or if they could, 'twere an unpleasant thing, To thinke of that which must repentance bring: Men care not to looke backe on time ill spent, For that remembrance needes must represent The shame, when they shall truely ponder it, Of what they tooke such pleasure to commit, Such onely as by reasons rule direct Their actions, can upon time-past reflect; He that hath oft ambitiously desir'd, Proudly contemn'd, with insolence requir'd His captives thraldome; he that hath deceiv'd Perfidiously, extortingly bereav'd, Or hath profusely spent, can hardly be Content to have recourse to memory; Whereas that onely is the Sacred time, That doth above all power of fortune clime: No sicknesse can disturbe, nor feare, nor want, The firme fruition of the same supplant: The present is but every single day, Which passeth in a moment, but we may At our owne pleasure all time past revive, Whereof the busy'd doe themselves deprive: It is the quiet mind, that can revoke
All parts of life, whereas a heavy yoake Imposed is upon the labouring thought, That to looke backe it hardly can be brought: Such lives are swallow'd up; and as tis vaine To seeke to fill what nothing can retaine, So is it bootlesse store of time to give To them, whose minds are like a leaking sive: Time present is so short, that 'tis by some Thought nothing, gone ere it be fully come, And stoppes no more then the Celestiall speare, Which never can its constant course forbeare, Yet that to busy'd men is onely left, Whereof they at the instant are bereft. BVt wouldst thou know how short a time they have? Then doe but see how long a time they crave; How earnestly doe old men begge t'obtaine, Some yeares addition to their small remaine; Who feigning themselves younger doe belye Their age, and are deceiv'd so willingly, As if the fates they also could delude; But by some deadly sicknesse be'ng pursu'd, How fearefully they draw their latest breath, And goe not, but are haled unto death; Then they repent, and vow if they recover Their health's, their wonted courses to give over; Finding their labour to small use imploy'd, When what is gotten cannot be enioy'd: Whereas a life from worldly troubles free Is long enough, and cannot subiect be
To Fortune, Riot, or an others will, Tis all our owne, and turnes to profit still; Though it be short, it doth cententment find, A Wise man dyes with an assured mind: But thou, purhaps wouldst be informed▪ whom I meane by buside men; not such as come Early into the Pleading place, and stay So late, that barking Dogges drive them away; Nor those, whom either their own Clients smother Bravely, or else by following an other Contemptuously are trod on; nor yet those That for base Lucre, their Estates expose To sordid out-cries; or whom flattery Drawes from their owne, at others gates to lye; Some mens repose is busines; in their Beds And Houses of retirement, are their Heads Still vainely troubled; such cannot be said To be at rest, but Idely busied. THink'st thou them quiet, that with so much care, Corinthian rusty Medalls will compare, That from the false they may discerne the true, Made pretious by the Folly of some few? Or those that goe to see (for loe we groane Not under Roman vices now alone) Youths with Oil'd-bodies wrastle on the Stage, Bred up on purpose of like shape and age? Think'st thou Him quiet, that spends halfe the day To have the tedious Barbour take away What grew the night before, that time can spare
To call a Councell upon every haire How it must lye; what Choller will he vent If once the Barber seemes but negligent? Who to displease him is as much afeard As if he cut the man, and not his beard; When by a Per'wigg th'haire's restor'd that's shed, Or growing thinne is o're the Fore-head spred; Into what passion will he straight be put If any part of his Deare maine be cut, Or if the same be discompos'd; he frets If all be not reduc'd to Annulets; May we not well beleeve he takes lesse care To have the State disordred, then his haire; Who rather to be spruce, then honest strives; Such are more curious of their lockes, then lives. Are they at rest, who their whole time doe passe But onely with a Combe, and Looking-glasse? That Songs doe either make, or sing, or heare; When as the voice, that to the naturall eare In the plaine note sounds best, is taught to run Wanton division with writh'd Faces done; Who on their Fingers measure verses feet, And though with serious, or sad things they meet, Yet are they ever warbling; such as these In Lazie businesse live, and not in ease: Nor have they vacant time, that feasts doe make; Because we se what curious paines, they take T'adorne with Plate their Cupboards, and devise To put their Pages in quaint Liveries; How carefull are they least the Cooke neglect
To send the Bore in dress'd as they expect? With what a quicknesse doe the servants fall Vnto their busines, when they heare the call? How neatly doth the Carver play his part, In cutting up the fowle with so much art? And after their full Cups spewing about, How soone th'unhappy boyes will wipe it out? In these respects, they covet to be thought Magnificent, and bounteous, and are brought In every course of life, to this condition They cannot eate or drinke, but with ambition: Nor have they quiet lives, that up and downe Are born in Chairs, and Litters, through the towne; For which they have their certain hours, when they That are their Bearers, dare not be away; Who must by other men be put in mind To Bath, to Swimme, to Sup, and are inclin'd To such a negligence, that they scarce know Themselves, whither they hungry be, or no; One of the nicer sort (if so it be, Nicenesse to loose humane society,) Lifted by men from forth a Bath all wet Into a Chaire, said to them, am I set? So strange a question made, can it be guest He knowes he lives, or sees, or is at rest? 'Tis doubtful, which most wretchednes doth show To know it not; or to faine not to know; Some things we doe forget, and some we faine, Some errours we are willing to retaine, As Arguments of Greatnes: 'tis for love
And Abiect persons to know what they doe. Goe then, and blame the Players bold abuse▪ More Follies they omit, then they traduce: So Copious is vice growne in this our age, Witty in ill alone, that we the Stage May rather taxe of negligence; can one To such a sensuality be growne That he by others must be told he fits? He is not quiet, that such things forgets; WE rather must some other word devise, That he is sicke, yea dead will but suffice; He is at rest, that doth his rest discerne, This halfe-alive, that must from others learne His bodies posture, never can be thought Of time to make advantage as he ought; Twere long to reckon them that spend the day At Chesse, at Ball, or at some other play Are roasted in the Sun; such men can spare No time, whose pleasures tedious businesse are; Nor can we doubt, but they laboriously Performe iust nothing, who themselves apply To fruitlesse Studies, frequent now in Rome, Twas a disease that first from Greece did come, To make it a rare peece of skill, to know How many in Vlisses Ship did Rowe; Th' Iliads or the Odisea, whether Were written first; or from the stile to gather If one compos'd them both; with such as these, Which if conceal'd, cannot the mind displease,
And utter'd, we thereby are not become More learned, but perhaps, more troublesome; Behold the Romans also have affected These needlesse Studies, formerly neglected; I knew a Wise man of these times would run Through every Act, and by what Captaine done, Affirming that Duillius first assail'd Our foes at Sea, and prosperously preuail'd; That Curius Dentatus was the first Led Elephants in Tryumph; these at worst, Examples are of ciuill Actions, though True Glory nothing to such things doth owe, Such knowledge profits little, though there bee Therein a kind of specious vanity; Let them that will have also leave t'enquire Who first possess'd the Romans with desire To build a Ship; 'twas Claudius, therefore he Was called Caudex, by which word we see The Ioyning fast of many Boords is meant, Whence publique Tables are by one consent Call'd Codices, and Boates of Tyber fram'd For Publique use, are Caudicariae nam'd; And let this knowledge not be needles thought, That first Valerius Corvinus brought Messana in Subiection, and thereby Added that Surname to his Family; Which from Messana, by corruption came To be Messalla, but was still the same; And it is not a knowledge of much use, That Sylla in the Cirque let Lions loose?
Whereas before they tyed were together, And that King Boccus sent Dart-flingers thether T'encounter them? yet these we may remit; But how can this for any use be fit, To know that Pompey in the peoples sight First brought the Eighteene Elephants to fight With men condemn'd? a Prince of High esteeme, And whom Fame for Humanity might seeme To rancke with Auncient Worthies, to devise New deaths for men, and ther'with feed his eyes? They fight, they goared are, at length they dye, And under those Huge Monsters buried lye; Surely this ought t'have beene forgotten quite, That so no great man after might delight To Imitate such an inhumane thing, And enuy that should detestation bring. O, How doth Greatnes blind mens Iudgments! he Thought himselfe rais'd above Mortality, When he so many wretches did ordaine To be by beasts bred in farre Countries slaine, Devising a strange Combat betweene Creatures Of so vnequall strength, and different natures, And in the Romans sight shedding such store Of Blood; (compell'd soone after to shed more,) He was at length perfidiously betray'd When his owne Slave rude hands upon him layd, And Murdred him, letting him plainly see That his proud Sur-name was but vanity. But to returne to my discourses and thence
To shew another fruitlesse diligence, The same man of Metellus said, when he The Carthaginians in Cicily. Had vanquish'd, that he onely Triumphed With Sixscore Elephants, as Captives lead; That Sylla first had leave to amplifie The Citty bounds for forraigne Victory, A thing allowed Aunciently to none But Conquerours in Italy alone; This is more worth our knowledge, then t'have found The Aventine to be without that bound, Because the people when they did dissent, So mainely from the Senate, thether went; Or that the Birds at Remus-Augury Were not observ'd about that place to fly: These and a thousand more they doe devise, Which either are, or else resemble lyes; But let us on their Credits now relie, And thinke them true, whose errours are thereby, Whose Lust suppress'd? whom may we therefore call More Iust, more Valiant, or more Liberall? Our Fabianus said, he doubted much Whether no knowledge better were, or such: They onely quiet are that Wisedome mind, They onely live; nor doe they thereby find Their lives in firme security alone, But every age they adde unto their owne: What ever hath beene acted heretofore Belongs to them; yea, that unvalued store Of Sacred Writers, for our use were borne,
Who ready are our present lives t'adorne: Thus we by others industry are taught, Great and rare things from darke oblivion brought, And are not limited, but uncontrould The secrets of all ages may behold; And if the greatnesse of our minds would climbe Above all humane frailty, we have time Enough, t'enquire out truths with Socrates, To propound questions with Carneades, To rest with Epicurus, to suppresse With Stoickes our affections vast excesse, And with the Cynickes to subdue them so, That we with Fate even hand in hand may goe: Why doe we then in this short time neglect These divine things, that all good men affect? Such as have daily offer'd up and downe Their meritorious Service in this towne, As vast in sensuall pleasures, as extent, That both themselves and others doe torment, When they have shew'd folly enough, and bin At every house that would receive them in; How have they beene put of by Luxury? Or Sleepe? or great mens Incivillity? Who having tortur'd them with long delay, Then pretend businesse, and make hast away; Or else to shun the place filled with store Of Suiters, have slunke forth at the backe Doore, As if it were not farre lesse barbarous To deny entrance, then t'abuse them thus: How have they courted him, whose sleepy head,
Shewes he hath yet scarse well recovered His last nights surfit, making others keepe Ill houres, to waite on his disorder'd fleepe, Who being often told the Suiters name, With a proud yawning will repeate the same. They are imploy'd to purpose, that doe passe Their time with Zeno and Pythagoras; That often to Democritus resort, That Aristotl' and Theophrastus Court, With other Authors of good Learning; they Bid all men welcome, sending them away Not empty, but more pleas'd, more happy farre; They, day and night at equall leasure are; They'll not compell, but teach us, how to dye; They'll not consume our yeares, but will supply Ours with their owne; their Friendship is to us Not costly, their discourse not dangerous. FRom these men we may carry what wee will, And having gotten much may get more still; What happines, what Reverend Age shall hee Obtaine, that is of their societie? There hath he those with whom he may advise What he should doe when any doubts arise; There he the truth without Reproach shall heare, And being prais'd, no flattery needes feare: By their Example he his life may frame, And strive like them to gaine a vertuous name: The choyce of our owne Parents did not lie In our owne Power, Chance gave them; but hereby
We may be borne, as we our selves shall please; The Families of Noble wits are these; Choose then in which thou wilt thy Race advance, And bee intitled to th' inheritance, Not the bare name; to wealth that must not be Hoorded up, basely, or malitiously, But bountifully spent; men grow not poore By such expence, those goods increase the more: These shall thy way t'Eternity prepare, And fixe thee there, from whence none can, or dare Thinke to remove thee; they alone can teach Mortality, Immortalitie to reach: Great Honours, Monuments, or what beside In strength of Law or structure is by pride Devis'd, shall soone decay, time doth invade That soonest, which the World hath Sacred made: Onely true Vertue can resist the rage Of present, and of future time, by Age That gaines esteeme; things neere them men enuy, But on remote looke with Impartiall eye: A Wisemans life is therefore large, not bound To those strict tearmes that Nature doth propound To others, Lawes, which mankind doth deplore; All Ages, like a God, doe him adore; He in the thought to time past takes content, Makes use of what is now, and doth prevent That which shall be; thus ioyning all in one His constant life can shortned be by none; Whereas their time must short and sad appeare, Who all these three forget, neglect, or feare;
And when death commeth, they too late begin To know how idly they imploy'd have bin. NOr is this any Argument at all That they live long, because for death they call; Their Folly workes on their affections so, That they, on what they feare, themselves do throw; Thus they seeke death, because they feare the same; Nor yet can we from hence a reason frame, Because the day seemes sometimes long, for they Repine that houres so slowly passe away Ere it be Supper time; if they remaine But a short while unbusy'd, they complaine, And not well knowing how the time to spend, Their thoughts to some new Vanity they bend: How tedious seemes that time, when they expect Some Sword-play, or some Masque that they affect? And yet how short is that they like? and short Because they like not long, but still resort To new delights, so that their daies become Not long at all, but rather wearisome; Those Nights seeme ever quickly at an end, That men in drinking, or with Harlots spend; Hence Poets in their Raptutes, to disguise And cherish humane errours, did devise That Iupiter, to lengthen the delight He with Alcmena tooke, doubled the night: But what can this be else, but vice t'enflame, To make the Gods the Authors of the same? And to Divinity ascribe th'excesse
Of Mortall mens Licentious wickednes? How can those nights seeme short? that cost so deare? They lose the day, that wish the night were neare; And lose the night with a desire of day; So much their feares their pleasures doe dismay; The thought of these two slender words, (How long) Can turne all mirth into a mournefull song: From this affection Kings their Powre lament, And in their Greatnes find but small content; As being Frighted often with this thought, That it must one day to an end be brought. When that proud Persian King o're vast Fields spred His spacious Army not then numbered, But in the view admir'd, He there shed teares, To thinke that but within on hundred Yeares, Not any one thereof should be alive; When he that wept, soone after did deprive By Sea and Land, by Fight, and Flight all those Of Life, which he with greife, did then suppose Would dye within one hundred Yeares. How then? Comes it to passe, that feare possesseth men In mid'st of Ioy? because their Ioyes rely On nothing, but the selfe same vanity That gave them being: what may we then gesse, Of that, which to be wretched they confesse, When the felicity through which they beare, And lift their thoughts so high, is not sincere? Great fortunes are accompany'd with care, And of all others, least assured are;
They stand in neede of other Happines To keepe their Happines, & new successe To guard their old; all things that come from Chaunce Vnstable are; yea that which doth advance It selfe the Highest, soonest falls to Ground; Then what true Pleasure can therein be found? Needs must their Life both short and wretched be, VVhen what they get with so much Misery, They keepe with more, and doubtfully maintaine VVhat formerly acquired was with Paine; In the meane while, but small account is made Of unrecouer'd time; new things invade The old, hope stirres up hope, desire desire, They change the matter, not the end require: Doe we our selves cease to be Candidate? VVee give our suffrages to others streight; If we give over our owne suites, we then Are hir'd to follow suites for other men; No sooner doe we leave of to accuse, But to be Iudges instantly we choose; Hath Marius left the VVarres? He shall receive The Consulship; did Quintius strive to leave The charge of the Dictatourship? he now Shall bee againe call'd to it, from the Plough; Scipio, too yong for so great things, shall goe Against the Carthaginians, and o're-throw Hanniball, and Antiochus subdue; The glory of our Consuls, and the true Pledge of his Brothers Honour, who unlesse Himselfe gaine-say it, shall with Iove poesse
An equall place; and when all this is done He the preserver with sedition Shall be provok'd, and having quight refus'd Such Honour as unto the Gods is us'd, He at the length growne old, shall take content To goe into a willfull Banishment: Thus happy or unhappy causes will Be never wanting to breede trouble still; Variety of busines hindereth rest, A thing desir'd by all, by few possest. EXempt thy selfe then from the multitude My deare Paulinus, having beene pursude By stormes, which might more years then thine re∣quire, Into a quiet Harbour now retire; Thinke but what privat blasts thou hast endur'd, What Publique tempests to thy selfe procur'd; Thy Vertue hath sufficiently bin try'd In Rough Affaires; now let it be apply'd To Calmer Waies; the most (at least, the best) Part of thy life, hath solely beene possest By the Republique; let then some be spent To thine owne use; nor is it my intent To call thee to a dull and lazie Ease, To drowne that vigour in delights that please The vulgar People; this gives no repose To any; there are greater things, then those Thou hast already done, that may by thee In thy retirement safely acted be; Th'Accompts of all the World thou managest
With temperance, as an others interest, With Fore-sight, thine owne, and with a zeale, As things that much concerne the Publique-weale: In doing this thy duty, thou gayn'st love, Wherein an other hardly could remove A generall hatred; it is better though To take accompt of thine owne life, then know What store of Graine there is; that strength of wit, That vigour of thy mind, for great things fit, From a charge (Honourable I must confesse, But not conducing unto happines:) Call home to thee; and think not thou wert borne And trayn'd in famous Arts, to lay up Corne; Thy Noble Education promis'd then Things of a Higher straine; there want not men That moulded are for labour, and can be Exact in matters of frugality; Dull Iades great Burthens fitter are to beare Then generous Horses; what a pitty 'twere Their stately backes with heavy loades to presse? Thinke also with thy selfe, to what excesse Of envy th'art expos'd; thou hast to doe With hunger, and the common people too: No reason workes, no equity prevailes, No Prayers move, when hunger them assailes. In Caius Caesars time, (who now at least If Sence of things abide in Soules deceast Is grieu'd to find the Roman people left In safety, and himselfe of life bereft,) The Store-howses so empty were of graine
That scarce a weekes Provision did remaine; While he with ioyned Ships large Bridges made, And with the forces of the Empire plaide, The worst of evills (Famine) was at hand, And that which followes, Ruine of the land; And this th'example of a Forreigne King, Vnfortunately proud and mad, did bring; What thoughts had they that then imployed were? Did they not Stones, Fire, Sword, and Caius feare? They all their Art (as they had cause) applide, The ill that in their Bowells lurk'd, to hide; For some are cur'd, ere they their Sicknes know; While others Deaths from such a knowledge grow. FOr these things then doe thou thy selfe prepare, Which more secure, more calme, more Noble are; Is it all one (think'st thou) thus to take thought That Corne be cleane into the Garner brought, And layd up dry, least it grow Musty streight, And heat, and that it answer the iust weight? Or to search out the highest Misteries, To know the Nature of the Deities, Their Will, their Forme and their Condition? To learne what manner of conclusion Waites on our Soules, where Fate will them bestow So soone as they forth of our Bodies goe? To understand what holds the heavier things Firme in the mid'st, and what the lighter brings To hang aboue, what highest beares the fire, And doth the motions of the Starres inspire,
With all hings else, that are by Nature sent To strike the wilest with astonishment. Wouldst thou from Earth to these things raise thy mind? Doo't while thy blood is warme; the Sprightful find Easi'st Aecesse, this course of life imparts These things unto thee, Love of all good Arts, True Vse of uerrue, Courage to defie The Powre of Lusts, Skill how to live and dye; Together with a firme and constant rest Whereof thou never canst be dispossest; All busy'd men are wretched; but yet none Like them that toyle, not onely in their owne Frequent affaires, but sleepe while others sleepe, And when they walke the Pace of others keepe, That eate with others appetites, and waite To be commanded; both to Love and hate Of all things the most free; their lives seeme short That thus unto anothers Will resort; They doe not envy him that gets Renowne By Pleading, or that weares the Purple Gowne, He ventures his life for it, 'have men call But one yeare by his Name, he wasteth all; Some, having stretched their ambitions wide, Dye yong, and in the midst of all their pride; Others, that have great Dignities obtain'd By many Indignitie, find they have gain'd But Titles to their Tombes; some, their last Age Fed with new hopes, like their first youth ingage In great and wicked Proiects, when they see Nothing but Death in their Infirmity,
HE sordid is, that catch'd with rude applause, Grown old, dies wrangling in a worthles cause, Like him, that weary lesse of toyle, then life, Faints in the mid'st of his officious strife; Or him, whom dying mid'st his heapes of Gold, His long-fed Heire with laughter doth behold: I cannot an Example here let passe That comes into my mind; Turanius was An aged man, exactly diligent, Who after Ninety yeares, a good part spent As Procuratour, willing to desist, By Caius Caesar was at length dismiss'd; But comming Home, he laid him on his Bed, Bidding his Servants Mourne as he were dead, Who standing round about him, did expresse Sorrow for their old Master's Quietnesse, Nor would his Family their griefe refraine, Till to his labour he were call'd againe: Is it such pleasure then to dye in cares? So are the thoughts of most bent to affaires, Their Bodies sooner then their minds doe faile, Thus they their owne infirmities assaile, And Age in no respect more Irkesome proves Then that from busines it them removes; Law doth not force a Souldier to Fight At Fifty Yeares, nor after Three-score cite A Senatour, men doe more hardly draw Leave from themselves to rest, then from the Law; In the meane time, while one anothers peace They daily interrupt, and never cease
To hurry, and be hurry'd; while they lye Together in a mutuall misery, Their life is without Fruit, without delight, Or any thing that should the Soule invite: No man makes Death his Obiect; to their hope All men desire to give the largest scope; Yea many contrive busines beyond Death, Resolue of stately Monuments, bequeath Great Guifts for Funerall Triumphs, and devise Workes to be talk'd of, with proud Obsequies; But these, like such as dye to soone, should have Torches, and Lampes, to light them to their Grave. FINIS.
