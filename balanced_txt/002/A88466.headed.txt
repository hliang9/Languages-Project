blazon or coat of arms By the Mayor. WHEREAS the Lords Day, (commonly called Sunday) is of late much bro∣ken and prophaned by diverse disorderly people, in carrying and putting to sale diverse victuals and other things: Yet in regard of the inevitable necessi∣ty of milke for many Infants, sicke, aged, and many medicines, as well on the Lords day as in the weeke dayes, without which they cannot subsist; by reason whereof, the sale of milke on that day cannot be avoided. And where∣as the Milkewomen in the City of London, and places adjacent, have most earnestly petitioned, That Order might be taken aswell about the sale of Milke on the said Dayes, that they might neverthelesse injoy the Ordinances of God, and sanctifie the Sabbath in obedience to the Com∣mands of God, and the pious Lawes of the Kingdome in that behalfe made. As also to pre∣vent the great abuse and fraud which is used by divers single persons using the said calling, give great prices for their milke to the Milke-masters, (those of the said calling (which have Fami∣lies to maintaine, and many Parish, and Church duties to pay) not being able to give the like) and to make up their money againe in retailing their milke, doe usually deceive the Com∣mon wealth, in selling by false measures, and vending flatten milke for new: It is there∣fore Ordered, That all and every person using the said calling of Milke-selling, and which are House keepers within the City of London and places adjacent, may repaire to the houses of their Customers, and serve them only in the morning of every Lords day with Milke, they not exceeding the houres of eight of the clocke (in the Summer,) and nine of the clocke (in the Winter time) of the same mornings, for the sale and serving thereof at the furthest; And that no such retaylers of Milke, shall presume to cry or sell any milke during the residue of the said dayes, nor in the evening of the same. And it is further Ordered, That no Milkemasters within the City of London, and places adjacent, shall sell the Milke (which their Kine doth yeeld in the evening of the Sabbath dayes) to any of their retailing Customers whatsoever; And that the same evenings milke (from time to time) of every Sabbath day, shall remaine and be unto the respective Milkemasters (Owners thereof) unto their owne Accompts, as their owne proper goods and Chattels, without (any way) charging the same, either to, or upon their (then) retailing Customer; Or mollesting, suing or troubling them or any of them, for any losse or dammage that shall or may arise or grow thereby. And lastly, for the preventing of the inhancing of the prices of Milke, and the great deceite which is daily used as foresaid, by many idle and extravagant single persons in retailing of Milke. It is ordered, that no milke∣master whatsoever at any time or times hereafter, shall utter, vend, or sell their milke to any retailing single person or persons whatsoever: And if any person or persons shall be found offending in the premises: That then they be brought before me the Lord Mayor, or some o∣ther of his Majesties Iustices of the Peace, to the end they may receive such punishment as to Iustice shall appertaine. Given under my hand this nineteenth day of June, Anno Dom. 1643. And in the nineteenth yeare of the Reigne of our Soveraigne Lord King Charles, of England, &c. ISAAC PENNINGTON Mayor
