GOOD NEWES From the NETHERLANDS, OR A Congratulatory Panegyrick, composed by a true Lover of his King, and Country: REjoice, brave Brittans now for Charls our King Is comming home, into his Realms to bring Peace, Piety, and Plenty, Law and Love, Religion, Justice, and what else may move Your hearts to exultations; Trade, and Arts Shall flourish more then ever, in all parts Of his Dominions, and we shall be free As well in Conscience, as propriety; So that enjoying this sweet liberty Vnder his blest Reign, we shall happier be, After those Tempests of Intestine Wars, Than if we ne'r had felt, and worn their scars. No former Age can boast, since Britain stood, A Prince more Sweet, more Great in Heart, more Good, More Wise, more Iust, more Try'd in all Events Of various chance: Forraign experience In State Affairs, in Wars, join'd to his own Rich natural Genius, and his Theory known, Make him a compleat Monarch. Oh! if I Could tell you with what magnanimity He bare the rude assaults of adverse fate When lost in hope, and ruin'd in Estate, Yet triumph'd by Heroick Patience, And strong Faith in the Divine Providence, How like a firm Colossus, stil the same, He stood the Winds which from the North-side came, You would conclude, that He who could command Himself so well, can rightly rule the Land, Yea govern the whole World: Prepare to sing Poeans of joy then to our Gracious King, Compose rich Panegyricks to his praise, And Poets, crown your temples all with Bays, Cut down your Woods and Forrests to make Fires May flame to Heaven, let Bels ring your desires, And all your Canons loud proclaim the King, Open your hands and hearts to bring him in: Establish him in Power, in Dignity, And in his lawfull just Authority: Give him his due Prerogative, let him be No King upon conditions, but Free, Not Limited, not onely Titular, But Absolute, Himself, and Singular, For 'tis a Priviledge the Law allows Unto his Birth, to which it humbly bows: Rather adde to the Flowers of his Crown, Then take from thence, and purchase a Renown Shall never die: This glorious work thus done, Thus perfected, with a Beam of the Sun Shall be subscrib'd, shall make you great in fame, And great in fortune, rich in a fair name Of Loyal Subjects, which shall ever be Entail'd on you, and your posterity: Give now your Votes to this, expresse your joy Of heart, and cry with me, Vive le Roy. W. L.
