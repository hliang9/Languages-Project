His Majesties MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT. My Lords and Gentlemen, I Return My hearty Thanks to you all for the great Demonstrations you have Given Me of your Affecti∣ons in this Sessions, and of your Zeal for the Support of the Government. And I must Thank you Gentlemen of the House of Commons in particular, for the Great Supplies you have Granted for the Prosecu∣tion of the War. I Assure you I shall take Care so to Dispose of the Money you have
Given Me for the Publick Occasions, as that the whole Nation may be entirely Satisfied with the Application of it. My Lords and Gentlemen, I Think it proper to Acquaint you with My Intentions of going beyond Sea very speedi∣ly, which I am Afraid have been already Re∣tarded, more then is convenient for the present Posture of Affairs; And upon that Account I Think it Necessary to put an End to this present Meeting. The Season of the Year be∣ing now so very far Advanced that it may prove of the last ill Consequence to Continue it any longer. FINIS.
