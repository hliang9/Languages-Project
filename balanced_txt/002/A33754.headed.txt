AN English Dictionary: EXPLAINING The difficult Terms that are used in Divinity, Husbandry, Physick, Phylosophy, Law, Navigation, Mathematicks, and other Arts and Sciences. CONTAINING Many Thousands of Hard Words (and proper names of Places) more than are in any other English Dictionary or Expositor. TOGETHER WITH The Etymological Derivation of them from their proper Fountains, whether Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French, or any other Language. In a Method more comprehensive, than any that is extant. By E. Coles, School-Master and Teacher of the Tongue to For∣reigners. Ben. Johnson. Much phrase that now is dead, shall be reviv'd; And much shall dye, that now it nobly liv'd, If Custom please; at whose disposing Will The pow'r and Rule of Speaking resteth still. Hor. de Arte Poet. LONDON, Printed for Peter Parker, at the Leg and Star over against the Royal Exchange in Cornhill, 1677.
TO THE READER. THE several Climates of the World, have influenced the Inhabitants with Natures very different from one ano∣ther. And their several speeches bear some proportion of Analogy with their Natures. The Spanish and the Spaniard both are Grave, the Italian and th' Italians Amourous, the Dutch as boisterous as the Germans, and the French as light as they themselves are. But the moderate Clime of England has indifferently temper'd us as to both: and what excess there is in either, must be attributed to the accession of something Foreign. Our changes are all professedly owing to the Conquests, especially of Sax and Normandy. The first was far the greater, and by virtue of That the body of our Language is still Teutonick: But the Last is that which more nearly concerneth us; because, though its first irruption was not a violent Inundation, yet it forced us to such a Communicati∣on with France, that our Genius is wrought into some resem∣blance of theirs: and (to imitate them) we bring home fashions, terms and phrases from every Nation and Language under Hea∣ven. Thus we should fill one another with Confusion and Barba∣rity, were it not for some such faithful Interpreter as is here pre∣sented to the Prince of Isles. Not that I am ignorant of what's already done. I know the whole Succession from Dr. Bulloker, to Dr. Skinner, from the smallest volume to the largest Folio. I know their difference and their Defects. Some are too little, some are too big; some are too plain (stufft with obscenity not to be named) and some so obscure, that (instead of expounding others) they have need themselves of an Expositor. The method of some is foolish, and supposes things to be known before they are explained. For
when the Terms of Art are reduced to their several Heads, you must know (in general) what your word is, before you can possi∣bly tell where to seek it; or else (as they say) you must look a needle in a bottle of Hay. Suppose you want the meaning of Belperopis or Dulcarnon, they are not in the Common herd; where will you look them? In the Law-terms? they are not there. Sure then they are proper Names; But they are not there neither. What's to be done? Why, look till you find and you will not lose your labour. Some that pretend to correction and exactness, transcribe out of others (hand over head) their very faults and all. Hear how severely Doctor Skinner taxes one of them,—Solens hallucinatur: and again, —Ridicule ut solet omnia: and in ano∣ther place, —ubi notare est miserrimam Authoris igno∣rantiam, &c. But that Man had but a little work, and so was bound to have done it well. It is excusable in a World of Words to say that Contemptible and Contemptuous, Ingenious and Ingenuous are all one: that Decomposit signifies Compounded of two other words: Emberweek is the week next before Lent: Froise, a pancake or tanie: Gallon, a measure of two quarts: Gomer, nine gal∣lons (instead of one.) Limbus Patrum, where the Saints reside till the Resurrection: Nazareth, the place where Christ was born, Redstert, a Robin Red-breast, &c. And a thousand more such, which simple Children would be apt to contradict, but Men of Judgement (for whom they were not writ) know where the mistake might lie. Yet sure 't would have made his worship smile, to have readd, how that Argus King of P. for his singular wisdom and circumspection, was feigned by the Poets to have had no eyes. Custode admittendo, a writ for the removing of a Guardian. Ejaculation, a yelling. Eviration, a yielding. Fidicula, a falling vulture. Ichidian, the Motto of the Princes Arms. Iopaena, a song of rejoicing. Lungis, a tall slim mn that has no length to his height. Mayweed, like Cammomile in smell, but of a stinking sa∣vour, &c.
So many there are of this Nature and so gross, that (let the reason be what it will) they are altogether intolerable. In that which I have done, I do not warrant absolute perfection. The pains that are taken in it, will appear at first sight. The ad∣dition that is made to the number of words in former Authors of this kind, is almost incredible (considering the bulk) being raised from seven in th' Expositor to almost thirty thousand here; which is some thousands more than are in Mr. Blunts Glossographia or Mr. Philips World of Words. The order I observe is altogether Al∣phabetical; for that best answers the design of Informing others. If any would have the proper Names, Terms of Law, Navigati∣on (or any other Art) by themselves, they may go through the whole and (with delight and profit) reduce them all to their par∣ticular Heads. I am no friend to vain and tedious repetitions. Therefore you will often meet with words explain'd in their dependance and re∣laton to one another, and the sence compleated by taking them together: as for example, Lupa, a She-wolf that nourished Romulus in the Lupercal, a place near Rome, where were celebrated the Lupercalia, Feasts in honour of Pan, performed by the Luperci, Priests of Pan—. Poetical expressions may be allowed to Poetical Relations and Fictions; yet here and there I give a hint, to let you know, that I take them not for real verities. The history of the Bible I suppose to be so well known, as that I only give the plain English of the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriack and Greek Names. Here is a large addition of many words and phrases that be∣long to our English Dialects in the several Counties, and where the particular Shire is not exprest, the distinction (according to the use) is more general into North and South-Country words. Here are also added all the Market-Towns (and other conside∣rable places) in England, with all the places of note in other Countries, especially the Neighbour Nations. Where it is to be observed, that (as Dr. Heylin saies of Hungary) it were in∣finite labour to expresse every little place which the seat of a war
gives occasion for History to mention. 'Tis no disparagement to understand the Canting Terms. It may chance to save your throat from being cut, or (at least) your Pocket from being pickt. I have not only retain'd, but very much augmented the num∣ber of Old Words. For though Mr. Blount (as he saies express∣ly) shunn'd them, because they grew obsolete; yet doubtless their use is very great: not only for the unfolding those Authors that did use them, but also for giving a great deal of light to o∣ther words that are still in use. Those that I call Old Words are generally such as occurr in Chaucer, Gower, Pierce Ploughman and Julian Barns. And whosoever has a mind, instead of them (or other vulgar terms) to use expressions that are more polite; he sees what words are markt for Latin, Greek or French, and may himself make such Collections as will be far more advantageous, than if they had been gathered to his hand. Finally, that I might be the more comprehensive (for here is very much in very little room) I have signified the derivation of the words from their several Originals, and the Names of the Coun∣ties in which they are used, by one or two of their initial letters; the meaning of which is exprest in the following Table.
