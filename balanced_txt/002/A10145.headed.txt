To his moste excellent Maiestie con∣cerning these proiects of the Author. BY knowledge true I did preferre, vnto your highnesse proiects three Of mickle worth, exceeding farre the subtill sleight of Enmitie. Shee seekes my truth for to suppresse, And I to Wisdome for redresse. Where reason is by knowledge found, your highnesse pleasure to fulfill: Extending many a thousand pound, in secret knowne to Arte and skill, Should single wits thereiudge or deeme where knowledge wants or hath not beene. I am not of that learned lore, of Riplie, Kellie, and other moe; Whose learned worke are gone before, figuratiuely, Imeane not so, But plainely in a homely stile, shewing the truth deuoide of guile. In plow-mans painefull toile, my skill is something good: And in the arte deuoide of guile, my minde not wauering stood. Loe yet my heart could not discearne, by glosing wordes that skill to learne.
By duety I doe bow and yeelde, by rigors rage I nothing see: By guilefull guiftes that hath been sild, brought to the baites of flatterie: My sight not dim, though blinde I am, and liues on earth a simple man. I am not knowne, nor will not be, but as the Bird who seeth the net: I fall into each ieopardie, and none but God the same can let, Therefore good King know most iust, in God aboue I put my trust. For if with golde I had beene fedde, my sellfe had had a passing parte: And eke my sences had been led, from learning of that noble arte Of knowledge, which so many knowe, vnto the end it proues not so, For knowledge is a sccret thing, and knowledge is a vertue great: And knowledge doth make wisdome spring and knowledge tis wherof we treate. The loue and life of euerie thing, with due obedience to our King. Blisse-full thy hap, thy life, and eke the daies, as Dauid did to God, giue thou thy praise, Who was, who is, euerlasting seeing, Rules Princes dead, and those now aliue being.
A Description of the manner how to mend high-waies. THis Treatise & discrip∣tion of High wayes, for these partes of his Maie∣sties Kingdome of Greate Brittaine, with their diuers and seuerall plat-formes, frames, order, and manner of making of them, whereby all the said high-waies shall or may bee made more sound and strong, pleasant, and comfortable for all maner of way-faring iourneying, or traueling with Cartes and carriages, or other waies by these said highwaies, All which is heerein plainely laide open and made manifest by Thomas Proctor Es∣quire. In this his Treatise is set downe for the generall good and helpfull in∣struction of al Countrimē, & for al places, and chiefly and moste needefully, where
there is greate lacke and want of good waies, and where there are verie little or no good waies made: as in Holland in Lincolne-shire & such like: and to the dayly continuall great griefe and heart break∣ing of man and beast, with charges, hin∣drances, wearing and tyring of them, and sometime to the great and imminent danger of their liues, and oftē spoile and losse of goods, and also in some places else where, great hurt and spoile of Fences and groundes, with riding and going o∣uer the Corne, and such like, by shifting & seeking the best way diuersly: all which by these meanes are, or may bee remedied and preuented: And although it may be that in the foresaid places, or some of thē, there hath beene bestowed the yearelye great allowance of so many yeares past, with the yearelye labours and charges thereof, and thereto by the lawes appoin∣ted and prouided with the beneuolence of so many well disposed persons, descea∣sed, which haue giuen for and towardes the making, mending, and repayring of high waies, in diuers and sundrie places of this his Maiesties saide kingdome,
with diuers other voluntarie helpes, be∣sides, the saide greate allowance of men, and matter fitting to these yearelye and common daies labour and workes, &c. The aforesaid considerately looked into, he findeth no reason why there should be any ill waies. Notwithstanding, all which, or much therof hath been bestow∣ed to little or no purpose, but much there∣of vtterly lost both cost, worke and stuffe, for want of meete matter, or orderly ma∣ner in disposing the same in their saide workes, as appeares too manifestlye in moste of those their works at this day. And as he by his practise and costs, hath found true and prooued: That the labour of twentie fixe able persons, that are readie in their worke, and well dispo∣sed thereunto with Pick-are, spade sho∣uell, rake and rammer, chipaxe and Au∣gur, to be chosen and taken out of euerie parish, and so forth generallye out of all such numbers, of all vsuall and common daies labours, &c. Orderlye to bee set to worke in this his manner, with their carts & carriages according, with some boyes and maides to helpe, where cause
requires, shal or may suffice to make half a furlong yearelye, and as much good and faire way, and dispatch them, to the bettering of the worst and foulest waies to be made good and strong in euerie pa∣rish, as twice so manye should or could haue done heeretofore in this proportio∣ned worke and orderly manner without this saide prescribed manner and order heerein made knowne. And heere withal is to be remembred that one principal and chiefe cause of al bad and foule waies is, that the raine water or other water doth lye and rest vpon ye highwaies (not order∣lye and soundlye made) which with the working of cart wheeles & others, dooth peirce downe more deeper into the saide waies, and so more and more doth soften and rot the same, as by dayly experience is seene and knowne. And also that the ditches and common showers are not yearely clensed so as is needfull, which are the best helpes to drawe and dreane the waters off and from the moste parte of all highwaies and groundes (as in reason there should bee) and by his Ma∣testies lawes ought to bee done; which
not hauing beene done orderly is one rea∣son of, and wherby much of their former labours and charges with their waies and works are wasted, as aforesaid, and little good way to bee found, whereas these foresaid thinges otherwise preuen∣ted, then once well made and stronglye done, though but a furlong yearelye in e∣uerie parish so to bee made, so as one parish may bee helpfull vnto another next adioyning with men or mony, of the surpulsages of other greater parishes, to supplie the wantes of the lesser pari∣shes, at the rate heere in this his book ex∣pressed so as by help one of another, there may easilye bee performed yearelye fortie rodds at the least in euerie parish, and so yearely by little and little heereby all for∣mer labours & charges which haue vn∣profitably beene wasted, shall bee cut off, and all such future labours and charges shal be preuented and saued to some need∣ful and profitable vses: For this saide worke once well made and done, must needes be better and cheaper, then yerely still a making and doing, and neuer well made and done, so as it ought to bee, and
as is by the lawes therfore appointed, in∣tended and ment. The neglect and necessitie wherof, and the loue to his country in this his last age and yeares, hath inforced him hereunto, out of his care, charge, paines and pract∣ice, to make known the same. The effects whereof dooth and may appeare with o∣ther his studies & labours for the general good of all in this his booke duelye or in∣differently considered, to the making and bettering, as is aforesaide of all high∣waies, thereby to be made more sufficient and durable, more easie, with much lesser matter, stuffe, charges, and expences thē euer heeretofore hath beene done (by their common daies labors) which by Art and action dooing, wil & may cut off and saue very much of the yerely charges & labors of former times and works, as aforesaid. First therfore a platforme and founda∣tion must bee cast & made in cawsy-wise, that is to say, to be made a rodd broad at the least, wherupon two carts may meet and passe one by another, & on either side the said cawsie of that bredsh, to draw a ditch of 3. foot depth, & 4. foot broad, & that
earth which shal be so digged, must be cast vp frō the said ditch to ye midst of ye caw∣sie of a rod broad, proportionally, that the middest & height of the said way may bee in bredth one yard, & higher by two foote in the midst, then at the outward sides or edges of the same: the higher ye midst and lower the sides, the drier and better way to void the water, which water is the on∣ly rotting and spoyling of al high waies, and the only losse of al charge and cōmon daies labours heretofore yt no good way hath been made and continued for want of true maner and forme, and due conside∣ration hereof in their former works. Secondly this cawsie, if it be of a clayish soile, or of such like slimy or spungy earth, it must be wrought and cast vp in ye win∣ter season, that it may haue time to settle and ioyne firmly and soundly together, & so being cast and made as before said, that no carts be suffered to passe vpō it, til the spring time, or that the earth thereof bee drie and hard, for marring and breaking his shape and forme made as before∣saide, for if in Summer it shall bee caste, it wil rise in such hard clottes and
tough greate lumpes, as will hardlye with greate labour and much ramming bee disgested and brought to a good foun∣dation, but at a far more greater charge then the before said, when the earth is soft and kindely to digge and ioyne together. The which thus cast & made in winter as before, besure thē that your forenamed ditches on either side the saide Cawsie be so artificially and hansomelye contriued, made and clensed of filth and soile, that the raine water which shall fall from the said Cawsie, may haue a speedie Current in those ditches, and so falling into ditch∣es which must bee made by some good iudgement of workemen, or other instru∣ment to that purpose, that the said water from thence may haue a good and speedy passage to the next ditches, and so from ditch to ditch, gutter to gutter, or other conueyances of water to the common shoares, and so to the next brook or maine streame adioyning to the saide workes or any of them. Thirdly, if your ground or earth in a∣ny of your waies to be made, bee garden∣like moulde, soft, sandye or crumbling, or
such like short earth, then will that sort of earth with small labour of ramming of it selfe, with treading and going vpon it in their labours & workes, settle and ioyne soundly together, and especiallye after some good shewres of raine falne there∣upon, which then will be a good founda∣tion presently, to frame and binde in with Timber, woodrailes or powles, as to place, lay, fill, and couer with stones gra∣uell, sand, or small wood to be cut of Bil∣let or faggot fashion, or anye other hard or drie matter to bee had or made by art or otherwise (according to the plentie or ne∣cessitie of euerie soile and place) as in di∣ners, and in euerie sundrie seueral man∣ners, sorts & formes of works and work∣ings, in this his booke is declared, shew∣ed, and plainely set downe in their places for euerie one to follow and worke there∣after accordingly: al which manners and emptie places of all those wood frames you do vse, must be filled as you see, either with wood, stones, Iron-cinders, Iron∣stones, Geauel stones or other, & so filled. Lastly to be well couered ouer with smal grauel, rubbish or sand, or anye other
stones broken smal. And heere is to be cō∣sidered, that in euery parish one with an∣other there are to be estimated of vnspea∣keable or vnknown numbers of houshol∣ders plowes & carts to be rated at three shillings euery cart, and therfore so many men for their worke of highwaies, to bee rated but at 8. pence euerie man the day, besides the help of women and children, fit to serue in this worke as heeretofore haue done, for gathering of stones and carrying of matter and stuffes with bowles, creeles and baskets & such like, for to fil hollow places according to their accustomed & yerely vsual maner heereto∣fore in repayring of high waies, which yerely amounteth to a great summe. From amongst which numbers of hous∣holders, plowes and carts before said are to be chosen or made for this worke two and fiftie men, with 12. carts, and 12 men part of ye said 52. for the seruice of 6. daies to bring in matter and stuffe likewise ac∣cording to the custom of the yerely repai∣ring of high waies in euerye parishe, and that thē euery cart & mā so seruiceable in these workes, to be rated for their 6. daies
labour, but as aforesaide, after three shil∣linges the day for euerye cart so seruing, and the rest of the said labouring men be∣ing 38 to be rated as aforesaid after eight pence the day, of which number of 38. there must be 20 at the least of verie suffi∣cient able men of some good iudgement in their own labours: If such bee wanting they must be chosen and hired to doe such work as ye surueyor or surueyors of ye said work, shal direct & appoint in euery parish according to these his rules in this his book vnder writtē. Likewise out of ye said rest of 52. now remaining, being now but 20.12. must be sufficiēt laborers with sho∣uels, pickare and spades, for making and fitting the saide platforme and foundati∣tion in manner and forme (as before said) to be readie for the second work, to be laid, made and framed vpon, to bee filled with earth, and fast rammed for shrinking. These last before said, 20. such able men wil digge ditch, cast, leuell, plaine, and make readie, and finish fortie rods, which is a furlong in all the saide sire daies, according to the Statutes heeretofore made, of and for the workes of euerye
yeare for euerie parish yearely this work during, but seauen or tenn yeares space, which after the saide accompt of fortie roddes in euerie parish yearely to bee wrought and made as before saide; will make good, fil, and dry vp al foule, hollow & bad places with a small yerelye charge and labour to bee maintained, passable, good and faire for euer after, where here∣tofore the labours and costs of such great numbers of housholders plowes & carts for these fiftie yeres past haue beene spent and loste, and little or fewe good waies made in any such order, maner and forme. If the ground, soyle, or earth bee clay∣ish, or destitute of stones, a binding must needes bee made for this worke of wood, framed and made & likewise filled with wood, as appeareth by the platformes heareafter discribed: That is to say, poles of young wood, or rayles of base Timber, of length eighteene foote, and in thicknesse or compasse round about some ten or twelue inches one with another, or lesse where wood is scant, & if they shall lacke of that length, to take two shorte, to make one longe, so as when they are fra∣med
and made fit, and pinned down with stakes with wodden pins through them, they may be a rod square at ye least with∣in the said frame and crost with such like timber made fast as is needfull, according to the platformes and sundrie maners of workes and working in this his booke plainely set downe. Also it is to bee considered, that if anye such matter & stuffe fit for the said work, cannot bee had within two miles of the said worke, as is moste commonly to bee had within that compasse in most places & parishes therabouts, being diligently sought for, yet neuertheles 12. cartes will suffice within their sixe common daies la∣bour, at two miles off, to bring in suffici∣ent loades of such matterof stones, wood, or other drye or hard matter, as will performe the yearely accomplishment and finishing of one furlong of the worst way euerie yeare in euerie parish, being fortie rods a yeare: and if it be at a mile off, or from the worke, then sixe cartes will per∣forme as much as the other twelue: if but at halfe a mile from the saide workes or Cawsie, then three cartes are able to per∣forme
the saide carriages, as in stonye or wood countries, where such stuffes or stones are neare at hand. And then there & in such places, so much money, labours & charges is spared & gotten after three shillings in euerie cart by day, more then in other parishes, where it is not so easie to be had, and so likewise in the mens la∣bors of euery housholder after eight pence by day, cōtaining great numbers in their former labours of their said high-waies, besides women & children, as aforesaid, yerely heeretofore so inconsiderntely con∣sumed and spent: all which charges heere∣by so saued, some part thereof to bee im∣ployed and reckoned for wood for the said frames and strong binding, and making of the said cawsie and high-waies with their belongings, & all the rest so saued to bee at his Maiesties good pleasure, to whose most gratious fauour, hee humbly submitteth himselfe, and to the good con∣sideration of all his louing countrie men, for this his skill and paines taken so di∣uersly to his cost and charge in setting foorth this his manners of high waies, with his other proiects of water, for ma∣king
of anye drie towne to haue waters brought vnto them, or neare vnto them, or bringing one riuer to or neare vnto ano∣ther, as Thames to or neare Seuerne, or Seuerne neare or to Thames at an easi∣er rate then any other, for botes, lighters and bardges with their ladings and car∣riages to passe too and froe with Sea∣coales, which are as wel in his maiesties forrest of Deane as in Wales, are plentie to be had neare there abouts, for transporta∣tion at a reasonable rate, with other more such like places (as now from New-cast∣le in way of Decaye) and also for making of Iron in quality and quanty good and merchantable, according to the nature of the mine, with a third part of wood-coles wher it may be spared, or otherwise with out any wood coles at al at greate profit, such as thereon may bee gained, 33. shillings vpon euery tunne, as the prise of Iron there now goeth, or three shillings vppon twentie, vpon euerie returne where the same shall bee made, for the generall good of his maiesties kingdome and Subiects.
All which, or any of them, he shall shew & performe the tryall by actiō & working of workemen, with cleare appearance of the benefits and profits theron, and ther∣in to his Maiestie if hee shall be called thereto, and thence to any other that shal desire to be satisfied therein, that shall bee fit and furnished therefore. A tryall and true performance of all the before said, may bee made vnder sixtie pound expences fully to satiffie, euery one of capable vnderstanding. These being true, as true they be, not set to worke is great pittie, But scorne and blame such workes they haue, where enuie knowledge doth depraue.
These frames heereafter following (beeing made of Wood) doe represent euerie one of them a rodde of ground square, where they shall bee made in wood countries, and where there is wood to be had, may all of them, or any of them be filled with wood, cut billet or fa∣got fashion, with hurdles or wattles, with bauins or brush wood, or such like for want of bigger, being vnbound and well placed and laid, and then well coue∣red ouer with other matter, & in manner as is declared with small grauell, or gra∣uell stones broken small, Iron-stone, I∣ron Cinders, sandie stone, thalke or lime, or any other hard or drie matter, made by art out of killnes: as bricke, hard tile, Potshardes or other earth, sand or any rubbish whatsoeuer: the dryer, harder, and smaller, the better and fayrer the way will be.
These figures heere vnder, euerie of them representing a rod of high-way squar,e bound with poles of young wood, or railes, crossed diuersly as you may see; are to bee filled within wt wood, stones, grauel, or such like matter, as best may be had diagram of roadbed structure depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch diagram of section of roadbed structure depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch diagram of section of roadbed structure depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch
These liwise as you see heere vnder figured, are to be fil∣led with stone or wood, and rammed hard downe as Pauiers doe, & then well ouercouered with grauel, smal stones or sand, Iron-cinders: or other, the smaller, the better the way. diagram of roadbed structure with wood, stone, etc. fillers depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch diagram of section of roadbed structure with wood, stone, etc. fillers depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch diagram of roadbed structure with wood, stone, etc. fillers depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch
These frames of wood and hurdles, or wattles made of spring wood, are of smal price, when they are wel made and ioyn∣ted together one to another, and must bee laid and placed as the ground riseth and falleth in his kinde, and as it lyeth before the way is made, shall neither neede trunckes, neither bridges: the reason bee∣ing, the water in these ditches running by the cawsie and frames, may passe verie wel ouer the said waies in those low pla∣ces and bottomes, and not stay, but spee∣dily passe and followe their current, into the next ditches to the common shewres, not hurting the wayes. depiction of wattle framework These are to be likened to the sheepe∣fold hurdles, and foure of these will serue a rodde way.
These frames héereunder bound about, & crossed as you sée, is first to be filled with all stones and couered as a foresaid. diagram of crossed framework forming part of roadbed depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch diagram of x-crossed framework filled with stones depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch And this likewise bound and crossed as you see with stones, & the rest of it to be filled as the former, with grauel or other. diagram of latticed framework forming part of roadbed structure depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch diagram of latticed framework filled with stones depiction of ditch bordering roadbed Ditch

This single frame being onelye bound with poles or rales, on the out sides, as you see of the waye, must be strongly sta∣ked & pinned downe, and thē filled, spread & couered ouer with ye aforesaid matters & especiallye with I∣ron-cinders, which wil make no illway; and is so plentifull in wood Countries, neare vnto the high waies, where there shall neede no other matter in those pari∣shes, and wel made, will indure with small repayring, but it must haue manye loads of stones, more matter & stuffe, then any of the before said workes, because it will shrinke & yeeld quicklye with ye wa∣ter & wheeles, and such like weight of horse and cariages. diagram of framework for roadbed And lastly in those Countries and places, where there shall lacke, and is not, or cannot be found, stones, grauell, sand, or young spring wood, to make frames, and to be cut billet or fa∣got fashion, neither Iron cinders, or anye such like hard and drie matter to fill and couer therwith, as in Holland in Lin∣colnoshire and such other. That there, and in such places, they must make or cause to be made, kilnes like lime kilnes, brick∣kilnes,
Tile, or Potter kilnes, wherein they must burne with sea-coales, pets or Turnes, claye or earth, & make hard matter thereof, of hardnesse poterlike: the bigger of which matter shall make the vpper part of the way vppon the foun∣dation therof, and the smaller thereof to couer againe vper∣moste aboue the other greater before said, and so ramme and settle the same close together on their high-waies there & in such places, where their greatest care in their workes must be to leaue their waies high in the midst, and so euen and han∣some, that no raine-water or ouerflowinges shall tarrie or a∣bide vpō their cawsie or high waies, but fal speedily into their ditches, as is moste meets and prescribed to all high waies, and in these places, and in such like, where there is little wood or none to bee had for heipe thereof, it shall bee verie good and profitable that there the inhabitants or dwellers neare, or other waies shall plant & set young plants of willowes or other, as shall bee most meete or fitting there∣fore, al along by the sides of the said high-waies and ditches, which will growe and yeelde in short time, yearely helpe to the mending & repayring of the same said high waies, wattles and with hurdles. The benefits and profits that shall or may arise vnto his Maiestie and subiects, here by art and action doing, if set on worke accordingly. HIs Maiestie by his moste royall authority, and there vn∣der this prescribed manner to bee performed and done. There shall be good & faire wayes made, which since the ma∣king of such good lawes, hetherto these 50. yeres past & more, hath not beene made and done accordingly, so as is now here∣by taught and set foorth how to bre done, and moste of them may be finished within the time prescribed, or thereabouts: where by from hencefoorth may bee faued manye thousand loades of matter and stuffe, charges and labors, and so thethy and there through many thousands of pounds yereiy, If but rated after three shillings for euerie Cart, out of such num∣bers as are set usceable to this said worke, by his Maisties Lawes and statutes appointed. And likewise, if but after 8. pence the day for euery man, out of the aforesaid greate num∣bers
so seruiceable as before said, & yet notwithstanding suf∣ficient left for the yerely repayring of the said waies for euer, and the rest so saued whatsoeuer, may be otherwise necessari∣ly imployed to other vses according to his maiesties good plea∣sure, or as shall be found most meete by his maiestie, and his moste honorable priuie counsell. Also for waters, Riuers and their benefits. THese saide waters or small riuers made for Boates and lighters to passe, that is to say, from one riuer to or neare vnto another, or from one Cittie, towne or place, too or neare vnto another, or into one another, where the same shall bee found meete and needfull: as from Thames too or neare vnto Seuerne, or from Seuerne to or neare vnto Thames, as also from Sarisburie, Stampford, North-hampton, Berry, Wak∣field and Leedes, or Oxford, as also from the riuer of Lee, neare vnto Stock-bridge, to or neare vnto Clarken-well lying, and being on the north side of London: all which or any of them may be done accordingly, and any of the which he wil vndertake to doe at an casterate, and better cheape then anye other shall doe, not vsing his way and manner. For that hee seeth in other mens workes, labors and manner, much vnpro∣fitably spent, which may and might be spaced and saued, all which the generall and necessarie vses whereof are many: as for transportation and carrying of coales, Sea-coales, wood, Leade, Iron, corne and graine, Flaxe, Hempe, Wollen and Linnen cloath, with many diuers and sundrie commodities, whereby a custome or rent may growe vnto his Maiesty, and case of charges & benefit by charges, & other benefits by inter∣change of commodities to diuere Townes, shires and places, whereby men euerie where may be stirred vp and prouoked diuersly to seeke and finde out such commodities whatsoeuer their Countrie shall affoord and bring foorth to the proffiting of themselues and others, And also by this meanes, that car∣ried for fiue shillings, which now vpon euerie tunne carrying costeth twentie, which then there shall or may be saued to help them vpon their commodities. The greatnes of the manifolde benefits, that heereby shall, may or might growe, hee leaueth to the good consideration and profound iudgement of the best
