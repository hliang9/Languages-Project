A POEM ON His Majesties Return TO WHITE-HALL. WHEN from his Nest the Royal Eagle flies, Forc't thence by threatning Storms and thundring Skies; The tender Brood, their Guardian tare away, To Sacrilegious Hands becomes a Prey. The dire Effects of Violence we see, That streight tears down the consecrated Tree. So when a Monarch from his Seat withdraws, Empire becomes a Prey to griping Claws, Of Ravenous Kites and Savage Tygers Jaws. Then welcom Caesar to thy trembling Realm; If Pilots in the Storm forsake the Helm, Prevailing Waves the Ship must soon o're-whelm. If dangerous Courses in the dark we steer'd, Let's take new Measures when the Skies are clear'd: The Fiends that rais'd the Tempest now disperst, Why should not now our Fortune be reverst? The guilty Jona's to the Billows give, But let the Royal Boat and Pilot live: Far be the Rashness from a private Muse, Wholly to charge or wholly to excuse. Who can but wish to have the Tempest cease! And ev'ry Voice must vote for publick Peace. Let Achan fall, the Troubler of the Land; Let Dagan tumble, but let Caesar stand. When to the Hive a Factious Drone may steal Of it's rich Sweets, to rob the Publick Weal; Who only for his lazy Cell purloins, (Lazy, but active in accurst Designs.) Th' Offender duly punisht, to the Hive Safety and Peace may once again arrive: But if the Royal Bee is once opprest, Inevitable Fate o're-whelms the rest. The guiddy Swarm will ruin their own Toil, And Rabble Bees the Publick Treasures spoil. When Hurricanes the Kaden Vessel shake, All Hands shou'd join to save the general Stake: But if the Pilot from the Harbour be forc't, The common Bonds of Safety are divorc't; By Winds and Waves the shatter'd Barque is tost. One Sailer takes a Plank, and one a Mast, But gaping Syrges swallow All at last. Then welcom Caesar to thy Royal Seat, Let Britains Foes and Britains Fears retreat; But Britain once again be safe, and Caesar great. FINIS.
