To the vertuous, and very worthy Gentlewo∣men, Mistris Anne: and Mistris Frauncis Iermin, daughters to the right worshipfull, Syr Robert Iermin Knight, (his very good Maister) G. K. wisheth in this life, increase of all vertues, and in the life to come, the full fruition of all happinesse. IT were a thing very vnnecessary (thrise worthy & vertuous gentlewomen) for mee (although I were able) to speake any thing in commendation & praise of Musicke, considering (besides that many learned men haue learnedly written in commendation there∣of) the examples of times past, and our owne expe∣rience euery day, doth giue sufficient testimonie both of the pleasure and proffit that it bringeth to a di∣stressed & melancholy mind. Also I think it conuenient not to answere (other∣wise then with silence) to those (more sencelesse then brute beastes) that with open mouthes doe in-veigh, & speake all the euill they can against that excellent knowledge. But it standeth mee in hand, rather to craue pardon, for this my boldnes, in putting to the veiw of so many learned Musitions, (which this age & Realme affordeth) these first fruites of my poore knowledge in Musicke, yet I hope, that as they themselues had small entrances, beefore they came to their perfection, so they will fauourably, accept of these beginnings, looking for better hereafter: And in hope of their better likings, I haue made choise of you to patronise these my labours, as well for the Haereditarie vertues of your godly parentes alreadie dwelling in you, as also for the delight, knowledge, and practise which you haue in Musicke, in the which few or none (that I know) can excell you. Vouch safe therefore (worthy Mistrisses) to vndertake the tuition of that, which by right & equitie, you may challenge for your owne, being no straungers, but home bredd, & which for your delight & cōtentments were first by me compiled: & as you seemed to like them, being mine, so I doe not doubt but you will more fauour them, now beeing your owne. Then I (your deuoted seruant) shall think my paines heerein very well rewarded, & be better encouraged to employ my time hereafter in your fur∣ther seruice. Yours in all duetie, George Kirbye.

IT were a thing very vnnecessary (thrise worthy & vertuous gentlewomen) for mee (although I were able) to speake any thing in commendation & praise of Musicke, considering (besides that many learned men haue learnedly written in commendation there∣of) the examples of times past, and our owne expe∣rience euery day, doth giue sufficient testimonie both of the pleasure and proffit that it bringeth to a di∣stressed & melancholy mind. Also I think it conuenient not to answere (other∣wise then with silence) to those (more sencelesse then brute beastes) that with open mouthes docin-veigh, & speake all the euill they can against that excellent knowledge. But it standeth mee in hand, rather to craue pardon, for this my boldnes, in putting to the veiw of so many learned Musitions, (which this age & Realme affordeth) these first fruites of my poore knowledge in Musicke, yet I hope, that as they themselues had small entrances, beefore they came to their perfection, so they will fauourably, accept of these beginnings, looking for better hereafter: And in hope of their better likings, I haue made choise of you to patronise these my labours, as well for the Haereditarie vertues of your godly parentes alreadie dwelling in you, as also for the delight, knowledge, and practise which you haue in Musicke, in the which few or none (that I know) can excell you. Vouchsafe therefore (worthy Mistrisses) to vndertake the tuition of that, which by right & equitie, you may challenge for your owne, being no straungers, but home bredd, & which for your delight & cōtentments were first by me compiled: & as you seemed to like them, being mine, so I doe not doubt but you will more fauour them, now beeing your owne. Then I (your deuoted seruant) shall think my paines heerein very well rewarded, & be better encouraged to employ my time hereafter in your fur∣ther seruice. Yours in all duetie, George Kirbye.

To the vertuous, and very worthy Gentlewo∣men, Mistris Anne: and Mistris Frauncis Iermin, daughters to the right worshipfull, Syr Robert Iermin Knight, (his very good Maister) G. K. wisheth in this life, increase of all vertues, and in the life to come, the full fruition of all happinesse. IT were a thing very vnnecessary (thrise worthy & vertuous gentlewomen) for mee (although I were able) to speake any thing in commendation & praise of Musicke, considering (besides that many learned men haue learnedly written in commendation there∣of) the examples of times past, and our owne expe∣rience euery day, doth giue sufficient testimonie both of the pleasure and proffit that it bringeth to a di∣stressed & melancholy mind. Also I think it conuenient not to answere (other∣wise then with silence) to those (more sencelesse then brute beastes) that with open mouthes doein-veigh, & speake all the euill they can against that excellent knowledge. But it standeth mee in hand, rather to craue pardon, for this my boldnes, in putting to the veiw of so many learned Musitions, (which this age & Realme affordeth) these first fruites of my poore knowledge in Musicke, yet I hope, that as they themselues had small entrances, beefore they came to their perfection, so they will fauourably, accept of these beginnings, looking for better hereafter: And in hope of their better likings, I haue made choise of you to patronise these my labours, as well for the Haereditarie vertues of your godly parentes alreadie dwelling in you, as also for the delight, knowledge, and practise which you haue in Musicke, in the which few or none (that I know) can excell you. Vouch safe therefore (worthy Mistrisses) to vndertake the tuition of that, which by right & equitie, you may challenge for your owne, being no straungers, but home bredd, & which for your delight & cōtentments were first by me compiled: & as you seemed to like them, being mine, so I doe not doubt but you will more fauour them, now beeing your owne. Then I (your deuoted seruant) shall think my paines heerein very well rewarded, & be better encouraged to employ my time hereafter in your fur∣ther seruice. Yours in all duetie, George Kirbye.
