TO THE READER. AS the true scope of all actions and endeuours ought chiefly to tend to the glorie of God, and to the good and common vtilitie of manie: so are those men wor∣thie of great praise and commendation, who not re∣garding their priuate gaine or glorie, haue laboured their wits, and spent their studies, in composing, tran∣slating, and publishing in our vulgar tongue either their owne workes, or such learned writings of others, as they thinke most necessarie for the publique weale; imitating therein the most famous Authours of auncient and moderne age: namely such as Hippocrates, Ga∣len, Auicen, Paracelsus and others, that haue in their natiue tongues ope∣ned and reuealed to posteritie the verie depths and secrets of that excel∣lent arte of Physicke: which as it is more auncient, more necessarie, more profitable, and more pleasant, than anie other arte or knowledge whatsoe∣uer (except the knowledge of true felicitie:) so it may boldly be sayd (though not without apprehension of griefe) no arte more falsified nor more abused in these dayes, as well by the presumptuous intermedling of audacious and vnskilfull persons; as for lacke of good and wholesome writings in English for the instruction and safe direction of all those that haue not alwayes a good and learned Physition at hand. Therefore (gentle Reader) that you may the better auoide these and such like mischieuous inconueniences, here is presented to your view the learned worke of that worthie Physition CHRISTOPHER VVIRTZVNG, first written and pub∣lished by himselfe in the high Dutch or Germaine language, wherein it hath bene more often printed there, than anie other VVorke of like na∣ture: Afterwards translated into the low Dutch or Flemmish tongue, by CAROLVS BATTVS Doctor in Physicke, whose iudgement and expe∣rience, the Citie of Dort in Holland doth willingly acknowledge: and now likewise Englished for the publike benefite of our countrey, by IAMES
MOSE Doctor in Physicke. VVhat paines and labour hath bene taken in the translating, it is referred to your owne fauourable censure, after you shall haue perused and made tryall of it. Onely this for the present may with your good fauour be boldly added out of the testimonies of men lear∣ned and skilfull in this facultie, that there is not published in our English tongue the like worke, wherein the whole bodie of Physicke is so succinct∣ly, so absolutely, or so artificially digested and compiled. For whether you consider the matter therein deliuered, or the manner of the deliuerie it self, which as it is altogether profitable, so is it easie and methodicall, descen∣ding from the head to the foote, shewing all manner of diseases incident to each part of our bodie, and setting downe first the causes from whence they spring, secondly the signes and tokens whereby they are knowne, and thirdly the remedies and helpes whereby they may be cured and eased. There is no doubt but when you haue indifferently perused, and heedfully noted the same, you will not onely concurre in iudgement with others, but also accept in all kindnesse the worke it selfe, and make such fauorable con∣struction of the good indeuours of those that haue laboured for your preseruation, as your selfe would looke to be rewarded withall in the like. Farewell.

A very meet and necessarie introduction, for the better vnderstanding of all such things as are handled in this present Practise of Phisicke. The Contents of the Jntroduction. THE miserie of mans life caused by sinne, hath constrained vs to thinke on such meanes, by the which the diseases that daily are inci∣dent vnto it, might be eased: which truly by the mercie of God, and Phisickes rule, at length haue bene found out. The profite and neces∣sitie whereof together, are iust causes why Phisicke may thorowly be praised. And because the sicknesses are manifold, and the bodie of man also diuided into many and sundrie parts & members, but prin∣cipally into foure: the Head, the Breast, the Belly, and the external or outward parts: Euery Maladie hath her due remedie: also where, when, how, and in what sort euery remedie is to be gotten, gathered, and kept: likewise if any superfluitie were in it, how and what is to be separated from it, what regiment or order is to be obserued in Purging, Letting of bloud, Cupping, or fastening of Horsleaches. Then is shewed the due and true vse of the Aire, of moouing, and quietnes: of wa∣king and sléeping, of meate and drinke. At length also are expounded the weights and measures which are vsed in Phisicke. Of the manifold miseries and calamities of mankind. The first Chapter. THe innumerable miseries, calamities, dangerous diseases and sores, which the life of man is daily and hourely subiect vnto, hath euen from the beginning of the world vntill this day, mooued, nay rather constrai∣ned diuers learned men, to examine and trie whatsoeuer the earth and nature her selfe hath yéelded, by that meanes to find ease for the disease and wretchednesse of mankind. Some Philosophers there be, that wholy haue employed and applyed themselues, to amend and heale the infirmi∣ties of the mind, haue extolled vertue, aduaunced honestie, and planted reason in the heart of man: they haue also set foorth vice in a most vgly shape, so to feare men from it, and to induce them to leade an honest & vertuous life. But because all this was groun∣ded only vpon the reason of man, and altogether without a sure foundation, it hath pleased God of his infinite mercies to supply the wants by his spirit in the holy Scripture, and there to teach whatsoeuer is necessarie vnto a vertuous and honest life: yet is the nature of man by sin so ouertaken, by the first fall so ouer-reached, so wrapped and rooted in iniquities, that at no time in him any goodnesse either is or may be found. Others there are, that haue taken no lesse paines, in séeking out the meanes to cure and help the innumerable maladies, accidents, sicknesses, and sores of the bodie, and therefore are forced to trie and approue all the creatures of God, as Rootes, Herbes, Flowers, Fruites, Stones, Woods, Mettals, all liuing beasts, yea euery element, each by himselfe, to find out the hidden vertues and properties, and to know to what vse they might rightly be applyed. This was
the first finding and foundation of this noble science of Phisick, and hath bene from time to time by diuers and sundrie experience of the old Phisitions diligently obserued, truely taught and written: and at the last also imparted vnto vs, and shall be reserued vntil the end of the world. The wret∣chednesse of mans life.And indeed, if we behold our owne wretchednesse, we shall euidently perceiue, that we in the whole course of our short life in this world, are as it were swimming in a boysterous and bottomlesse sea, where waue vpon waue vncessantly couereth vs, and is readie to swallow vs vp: where we are tossed too and fro, not finding any place to rest our foote, or frée our head from water: and albeit at length (with much ado) we do from stormie seas arriue on shore; yet there we find as many thistles and thornes, calamities and miseries about vs, which do pricke and plague vs on euery side, vntill our miserable flesh at the last returne (whence it began) to the dust and wormes meate. This it is, that the Prophet Esay acknowledgeth, when he saith: What is man? All flesh is grasse, and all the glorie thereof is as the flower of the field. Behold, the grasse withereth, and the flower falleth away, for the breath of the Lord bloweth on them. And Dauid sayeth: What is man that thou art so mindfull of him, and the sonne of man, that thou visitest him? Man is as it were no∣thing: his dayes passe away like a shadow. With many such like sayings in diuers places of his Psalmes. And in very truth, if we rightly waigh our estate, what is our life (so long as we re∣maine on earth) more then a continuall anguish and paine, labour, feare, sorowe, and alas al∣together troublesome?Wretched∣nesse of new∣borne babes. Behold our wretchednesse, euen from the houre of our birth: we are brought foorth not onely in perill and danger of our selues, but hazarding also our mothers life. But granting that happily we are borne, yet are we not able in any wise, or any way to helpe or aide our selues, but are as it were thrust headlong into an euerlasting and terrible prison: for we are no sooner come to the world, but presently we are fettered and bound both hand and foote: then must we eate and drinke what others commaund, we must sléepe and awake when others will: there lye we wrapped in our owne filth, then do we abide paine in the belly, gnaw∣ing of the wormes, ach of the gums and téeth, neither can we (which is the greatest miserie of all) complaine and shew our paine and griefe, but lye wéeping and wailing euermore. Beside all this, how long créepe we vpon all foure, not hauing vse of leg or hand? how long liue we, before we chat or prate any whit at all? Thus without hand, without foote, without tong, yea without any ioynt that doth his dutie aright, liue we (though not séeming to liue) some yeares together: and thus we spend infancie in miserie. Afterward comming peraduenture a little further, what followeth more than stripes and blowes, braulings and chidings of the parents, schoolemasters, and ouerséeers, till at the last (if so it please God to preserue vs) we, with no smal sorrow, care, and trouble of our parents, leaue childhood and enter into youth? But now alas, with much trauell and paine being come to youths estate,Of youth. we are in ten thousands of perilles both of bodie and soule: for now we grow wanton and lasciuious, stubborne and obstinate towards our parents, vicious and vngodly in the sight of God, as by experience daily we find and see, and néede not any further proofe. What sorrowes and cares after all these, bring mans yeares with them? great labour and paines taking do they againe require to maintaine him∣selfe, his wife, his children and familie to féed and find them honestly and well, to supply their wants, to estéeme of friends, to beware of enemies, and to take care for the Commonwealth. If then at length peraduenture he come to any preferment, office, or gouernance in that place where he liueth, he is not onely constrained to set behind and omit his owne affaires and busi∣nesse, but is hated also and enuied of others, now soroweth, dow ioyeth for his countries estate, now with one thing, now with another troubled and vexed in mind. Furthermore, the tur∣moile and paines he taketh, resteth neither night nor day, otherwhiles called vpon for one mat∣ter, straight way for another, and then at the last reapeth his paines for his labour, and is re∣warded with ingratitude, yea oftentimes he is endangered of goods, of honour, of life and all. Thus with much trauell, with many perils, and with great pains gaineth he nothing but gray haires and old age.Old age a sicknesse of it selfe. And to conclude, what is old age else then a very sicknesse it selfe, féeble, weake, full of sorowes, and an heape of cares, not regarded and estéemed of those that should most account of it? I will not rehearse here the temptations of sathan, vexations and trou∣bles in mind, pricking of the conscience, and many other heauie matters, which age is subiect vnto, but end with this, that the old man goeth with one foot in the graue, and hath nothing more surer then death at his doore. When we beginne to bethinke with our selues, either what sicknesses we haue had & withstood, or what we haue séene in others, and what diseases we are
subiect vnto, what strange, how diuerse, and what incurable calamities, euen from the hower of our birth, till our dying day are incident vnto vs, as leprosie, falling sicknes, lamenesse, blind∣nesse, deafnesse, &c. Out of all which we may easily gather, and euidently see, that our short life is nothing else but a long dying day, in yt which all miseries méet. This may well be a iust cause to admonish vs to thinke vpon another home, which is promised and prepared for vs, of that most cunning Phisition and Sauiour of our soules Christ Iesus, which we shall find to be without all troubles or cares, without wants, and without end. The second Chapter. The causes of mans miseries and wretchednesse. THe reason of man (as alwaies if hath done euen from the beginning) sée∣meth to complaine greatly,The cause of mans wret∣chednesse that our nature shold be subiect vnto so many infirmities, miseries and calamities: yea it doth as it were chide with God, and accuse him of tyranny, for creating of man so wretched. And in very déed, a worldly minded man, that neither acknowledgeth God, nor the cause of his naturall imperfections, might easily be brought, and car∣ried away with such like opinions, and with great reason bewayle the infinite wretchednesse of mankind, séeing he findeth no creature on the face of the whole earth, that is vexed with so many aduersities, but man onely: But contrari∣wise, they that are indued with the knowledge of God and godlinesse, will not accuse him of ty∣rannie that is most gentle; will not accuse him of euill, that hath created and made all things most perfect and good, nay, that neuer could or would do harme. Adam was created in the be∣ginning sound and whole, perfect wise, absolute, and without any blemish or spot whatsoeuer: but by disobedience, transgressing the commandement of God, in that he would without con∣tradiction be made like vnto God, and know both good and euill, which he did of his owne stub∣borne head, and in despite and contempt of his Creator: herewith hath he not onely brought and wrought vnto himselfe, but vnto all his posteritie after him, an euerlasting mishappe and infelicitie, as a well worthie and deserued punishment for his and our misdéedes together. Wherefore sinne is the first and onely cause of all our distresse, of all our sicknesses and heaui∣nesse here on earth: which hath brought vs to that estate, that after all our turmoyling & paines taking, we must at the last tast and take death as a merit and payment for our sinnes. This if a godly man consider with himselfe,Christians beare their crosse with patience. and (as Saint Paul saith) sigheth for sinnes fake, then doth he beare the crosse patiently, acknowledgeth it to be a fatherly warning and re∣buke, vseth due and true meanes: First, calleth to God euen from the bottome of his heart, committeth both his life and his death into his hands: afterwards commeth vnto Phisicke, the which it hath pleased God of his mercie to ordaine for the behoofe and néede of man, and hath taught it his seruants the phisitions. Also it is his will and pleasure, that we should vse his creatures in our necessitie, and giue him praise and thankes for them. And to the end the afore∣said meanes might the better be vsed, he hath mercifully lent and sent vs the Phisition and phi∣sicke, and hath shewed vs a way, by which those meanes might best be wrought. And to the end, this might in our natiue language be better published and shewed abroad, I thought good not to burie, but to employ this litle talent of mine, which for this end and pur∣pose I haue receiued of God. In which worke, my purpose and intent is, to begin and diuide the bodie of man orderly from the crown of the head, and so descend downward from ioynt to ioynt, til I come to the sole of the foote: and withall to shew, what infirmities euery part and member is most subiect vnto: And lastly, how, and by what meanes they may be cured. But séeing this cannot be done without phisicke and phisitions helpe; I thought it best, first to shew the iust dignitie and woorthie praise of them both, before we go forward with our in∣tent and purpose.
The third Chapter. Of the necessitie, profite, and praise of Phisicke. The neede and praise of Phisicke.SEeing it hath pleased almightie God, that we should, with many infir∣mities of bodie, and with great and heauie troubles and vexations of mind, runne on and continue this our race and pilgrimage on earth; and that we might preserue this lumpe of clay, flie and auoide those things that might harme it, take away the incident infirmities, and to kéepe our bodies a pure habitation for God and his holy Spirit, as it pleaseth him to grant vs life, he hath also of his infinit mercie and goodnesse crea∣ted (as is aboue shewed) naturall and effectuall meanes, reuealed them, and in pitie, so bountifully by the art of Phisicke imparted and commu∣nicated vnto man, that Iesus Sirach saith in this manner: Honour the Phisition with that honor that is due vnto him, because of necessitie: for the Lord hath created him; for the most high commeth healing, and he shall receiue gifts of the King: The knowledge of the Phisition lifteth vp his head, and in the sight of great men he shall be in admiration: The Lord hath created medicines of the earth, and he that is wise will not abhorre them. Was not the water made sweet with wood, that men might know the vertue thereof? So he hath giuen men knowledge, that he might be glorified in his wondrous workes. And giueth thereu∣pon a good lesson well to be noted and kept, as that we should leaue off from sinne, and not faile in our sicknesse that we should pray vnto God that he would heale vs, and afterwards giue place to the Phisition. What greater praise also can we haue of phisicke, than that onely example of Christ our Lord and Sauiour? what else was his whole life, whilest he was amongst vs here vpon earth, but first, as it were a spirituall curing and healing of the soule, and afterward also of the body, shewing thereby that he was the true Phisition, the onely healer and helper both of bodie and soule of man? He made the blind to sée, the deafe to heare, the dumbe to speake, the lame to go, he cleansed the lepers, stayed the bloudie flixe, which all Phisitions could not do, draue the di∣uels out of the possessed, and to conclude, he raised the dead. Such expert and cunning Phisiti∣ons after him were his Apostles: who oftentimes haue expounded this healing of the sicke, to be a shadow of our saluation, & mysterie of his holy word, and a rule or pathway for the whole life of a Christian. Is not this a sufficient praise and commendation of this Art? The heathen and wise men heretofore, haue so estéemed of this great gift of God, that they haue not onely ascribed the Art it selfe vnto the gods, but also haue reuerenced all those that were skilfull in it, with such honour, as was due vnto their gods; as we may reade of Apollo, Aesculapius, Chiron, Machaon, Paeon, and also Hippocrates. Phisicke is a sure pawne.If thou regard riches: what expert Phisition euer lacked wealth, (as Galen testifieth) that respecteth and careth for it? Most true it is, that Phisicke is a most firme and sure pawne, that defendeth the possessor from extreme pouertie: An approued Phisition may go whither he wil, euery where findeth he store of sicke and diseased people, and if peraduenture some speake not well of him, yet others will, so that neuer he can want where euer he be. Neither is there any vocation vnder the Sunne that is lesse hated and enuied, then the estate of a Phisition: for the greatest tyrant in the world, if he fall into an extremitie of sicknesse, and knowe a renowmed Phisition, whom he hath euer hated and greatly iniuried, his counsell will he séeke in the time of his infirmitie, forgetting all rancor and euill will, & laying aside all the iniuries that passed betwéene them, yea he will commit both life and death into his hands, and afterward reward him honorably. A godly Phisition also may saue the soule of an vngodly and vicious man: for although he were neuer so wicked, that neuer had once thought on God, or his iudgement to come, and falling into a great sicknesse of bodie, very seldome séeketh for God, but sendeth only for the phisition of the bodie: who comming, may very conueniently mixe spirituall phisicke with his corporall medicines, admonish the diseased to repentance, to sorow for his sinnes, and to leade a more righteous life hereafter: The sicke taketh his counsell kindly, assuring himselfe
that it procéedeth from a good mind, and spoken by him that séeketh not onely to saue and pro∣long his life; but also by Gods helpe, to cure him of his present infirmitie. And indéed we finde by daily experience, that in such a case a godly Phisition more effecteth, than a good Diuine or Preacher: It is also an euen pathway for the Phisition to obtaine the blessing of God, when he saith: Come ye blessed, inherit the kingdome of my Father, which hath bene prepared for you, euen from the beginning of the world: for I haue bene sicke, and you haue visited and comforted me, &c. Phisicke is thus defined or described: Phisicke is an art, which doth no lesse maintaine health,The defini∣tion of Phi∣sicke. then cure and take away sicknesse. Phisicke is a supplying of that which is wanting, and a diminishing of that which aboun∣deth: If any one list to heare a longer and larger discourse of this, let him reade Galen in his booke De Arte medendi. And albeit, that there haue bene some learned men heretofore, and peraduenture yet are, that do séeme to scoffe and mocke at phisicke and Phisitions: as Cato, Plinie, and the rest: yet let them say what they list, the art of phisicke shall to the end of the world well and worthily be estéemed and accounted. Neither néedeth any one to be offended, for that there are many, that falsly vse and abuse the name and title of the Phisition, thrusting themselues into phisicke, that neuer learned the art, neither studied or made any one thing in it: deceiuing all men vnder a colour of faire spéeches, and flatterie, with costly apparell, with chaines of gold and iewels so bedeckt, and so adorned with euery costly thing, that many are induced to wonder at them. In Egypt were all Phisitions very gallantly and well maintained, although they had but one par∣ticular remedie for one onely disease. A Phisition (as Homer saith) is a man, that is to be estée∣med as a great number of men: and Seneca, speaking in the commendation of phisicke, saith, we buy of the Phisition an inestimable treasure, namely, life and health of bodie: and we do daily find by experience both in Court and countrie, that there is not a more ample vocation, than that of phisicke: for certainely we see that euery one striueth to be a Phisition: and no sooner can any one either be pricked with a pin, or stung with a Bee, yea scant bitten with a flea, but euery one straight waies giueth his counsell, and as it were presenteth himselfe to be Phisition for the aggrieued patient. The fourth Chapter. The diuision of this present worke. THe causes that haue induced me to compile and make this present booke,The diuision of the whole worke. I haue partly shewed before: partly also intreated and very earnestly requested by such persons, whom I could not, and willingly would not denie a greater mat∣ter then this was: as that I would comprehend in writing, not onely such things as by long experience my selfe haue approued, but also whatsoeuer I had either seene, read, heard, or duly and truly obserued and noted, amongst the most expert and learned Phisitions of all nations, as well the auncient as later writers. And that I would not onely write according to the cōmon custome: Fiat secundum artem: but as much as is possible, and as neede shall require, adde also the preparation of euery remedie: for in this if a little error be once committed, a great displeasure and fault might easily ensue, the opera∣tion of the medicine weakened, and oftentimes altogether lost and perished. In fine, this whole worke was made, to the intent, that euery good housholder in the time of sicknesse, hauing neither Phisition nor Apothecaries neare him, or at least none skilfull in that Art, might himselfe know how to prepare and vse any medicine that might serue for his disease, or what he might as best and meetest send for at the Apothecaries for his purpose. In like sort also may he iudge of the properties and vertues of compoūded or mixed medicines, as Electuaries, Syrupes, Pils, Powders, &c. and which of them in euery disease might rightly be applyed and vsed. Furthermore, I haue very diligently obserued and noted the iust dosis, pro∣portion, or quantitie of euery medicine that is at one time to be vsed, and what things are to be auoided and shunned. And for this cause, haue I parted it into sixe treatises or parts, named and shewed diuers kinds of poysons, to the end that better heeded might be taken in shunning them,
and if by some mischance they had bene taken inwardly, how to infringe and breake the force and violence of them. And albeit some things there be noted and set down in this booke, which might seeme better to haue bene passed ouer in silence, yet was it done to such an end, that the deceits and knaueries, by which the common sort of people is oftentimes illuded, might be dis∣closed and bewrayed, to teach them also to take héed hereafter of those that wold deceiue them, and onely to regard those things that are grounded on reason and skill. All such things as are noted with Latine names, are either those that haue no English name as yet knowne, or else that are not growing here in England, but are commonly found at the Apothecaries. The method we haue obserued in this booke, is according to the customes and orders of the ancient phisical writers, who diuiding mans bodie into foure generall parts, to wit, the Head, the Brest, the Belly, and the externall or outward partes: so also haue I diuided and cut this present worke into foure bookes: The one for the head: the other for the breast: the third for the belly: and the fourth for the outward members: as at large in the beginning of euery of them shall be shewed. Vnto these foure first are adioyned other foure bookes, and not without cause: for that the method and order I haue obserued, requireth and asketh no lesse, as shall be shewed hereafter. The auncient Phisitions haue (as is alreadie sayed) for sundrie and very necessarie causes, diuided the bodie of man into foure generall parts. The first part containeth the head, and stretcheth no further than vnto the necke: the second part hath the breast vnto the midriffe, or to the lowermost short ribs: the third part is the belly, with all that is in it, euen vnto the hippes: the fourth part are the outward members, as Armes, Hands, Thighes, Legs, Féet, &c. with all their particular parts and ioynts. This very same method (if God of his infinite mercie giue me grace) do I purpose in this my worke to follow. And this may suffice, to let vs sée the wretchednesse of mans nature: the fountaines and cau∣ses of all infirmities, and also the necessitie, profite and praise of phisicke. But before I procéed any further in describing of diseases with their appropriate remedies, I thinke it were very meet and necessarie to giue a more clearer instruction in some points of phisicke, to the end that such as shall vse this booke might haue the better vnderstanding in the preparing of medicines. The fift Chapter. How all manner of Rootes, Barkes, Herbes, Flowers, Fruites, and such like may be gathered and kept. The best time to ga∣ther rootes.THe best time and most conuenient to dig or plucke vp rootes, according to some mens iudgement, is the haruest or Autumne, when the leaues do wither and fall away. Others suppose the spring time to be most méete for the same intent, when the herbe doth first beginne to appeare and créepe foorth of the ground: But the greatest and fittest obseruation in the gathering of them is this, to note the place or ground they grow in, the time when they are sappiest and fullest of iuice, and the vse, as either that we must néedes haue them, or that we must haue them greene & fresh. We must indeuour also to haue them fresh new digged out of the ground, to wash them cleane, to separate the small haires and lesser branches from the roote, to crop off the stalkes and tops, to cut away that which is rotten and worme eaten. All these rootes which are woodie within, as of Fennell, of Cichorie, of Parsly, &c. shall the hard and woodie heart be taken out of. The biggest rootes must be split asunder, and afterwards dried in the shade and in open aire. And if it be moist and wet weather, they are to be put in a warme place, where no ill smoake cometh, with often turning them vpside downe. They must also be kept frée from Sunne, moisture, dust and smoake, and be hanged vp in such a place, where the wind and fresh aire may sometime come to them. The lesser rootes, as of Spa∣rage, Valerian, Azarabacca, are kept longer then a yeare, and continue of like force and vertue. The great and hard rootes, as of Brionie, Gentian, and Aristologie, as also amongst the lesser,
both kinds of Neesewort may well be reserued thrée yeares together, without any let or hinde∣rance to their vertue: The rindes of the rootes being separated (as is aforesaid) from the inner∣most wooddie parts, shall in like sort be dried and kept. As concerning herbes, it is the common opinion,Herbes. that they ought to be gathered within thirtie daies, as from the 15. of August, vnto the 15. of September. But séeing that some herbs do sooner come to their full perfection and growth, other some later: (which difference for the most part dependeth on the diuersitie of the countrie, or else of the ground and place where they growe) the best time of gathering them shall be either when they beare their flower, or when the leafe is at the biggest, and when they smell strongest and are best coloured. They must bée dried in the shade, or else in a reasonable warme place, where neither dust nor smoke can come at them. They continue not in their full vertue and strength aboue one yeare. All manner of Flowers shall be gathered when they are full blowne and wide open,Flowers. while they be fresh and not withered, not when they haue lost their smell. Roses must be gathered when they begin to blowe, and as yet not full blowne: None of them all may be kept aboue one yeare, except the flowers of Cammomil, and that is by reason they be naturally drie: the sweet smelling flowers are longest preserued and kept in boxes of Lentill wood. Concerning Fruites, Nature it selfe teacheth vs,Fruites. that they ought to be gathered or plucked from the trée, not bruising them, at such a time when they are at the ripest: those that haue stones in them, may haue the stones (if it so seeme good) taken foorth, afterwards thoroughly and well dried, or preserued and confected in honie or sugar, as is taught in the 8. part of this booke. Séedes are ripest and of most vertue, when the fruites are full ripe,Seedes. and when herbes are at their full growth, all dust shall be sifted or fanned from them, then bound vp in paper, which longest kéepeth them good. Some séedes may be kept longer in their full vertue and strength, o∣thers must be new gathered euery yeare, but easily it may be discerned by the tast, which of them hath lost his vertue, and which hath not. Addition. For the gathering of simples and their partes, there be almost as many mindes and diuersi∣ties of opinions, as Authours that write of them. The one will haue them gathered when they beare their flower: the other before, or when the leafe is at the biggest, and they readie to haue flowers: the third sort, when they are but young and new come foorth of the ground. Some do ga∣ther one and the selfe same hearbe at sundrie times, as when it first springeth out of the earth, when it beareth his flower, and when it beareth seede: adding, that the first is for children and young folkes, the second for middle aged, and the last for old men. Other some would haue the leafe, the stalke, the roote, the flower and the seede each gathered and reserued apart, affirming each part of them to serue for sundrie vses. There are yet others, that gather all manner of hearbes in their seuerall moneths, beginning the moneth still when the Sunne entreth into one of the twelue cele∣stiall signes, saying, that euery hearbe hath most vertue when it most flourisheth: some adde vn∣to this the full Moone. But howsoeuer it be, this I knowe by experience, that not onely the di∣uersitie of the time in gathering them, in preparing and in reseruing them, but also the manifold vses of them, are iust causes of sundrie, nay, cleane contrarie effects and operations in them. For this I haue seene, that one and the selfe same Simple being gathered at sundrie times in one and the selfe same place, shall purge and bind, which are quite contrarie effects. And therefore it is no maruell, if sometimes we misse of our expected purpose and hope, in not finding those vertues in the Simples, that by Hippocrates, Galen, Dioscorides and others, are ascribed vnto them, seeing they are of diuers men gathered without regard of time or place, prepared without care, re∣serued and kept they passe not how nor how long. I remember, that as I trauelled through the Dukedome of Brownswicke, I heard of a woman that was very famous (in the towne there called Gosler) for womens diseases, but especially in staying and prouoking their menstruall fluxes: with whome when I had conferred about her art, I found that it was one onely hearbe, but gathered
at sundrie times. The reason of all these opinions and sundrie operations, because it is not our in∣tent nor meaning here to recite them, we will deferre them till a more fit oportunitie be offered. The sixt Chapter. Of the preparation of some things for Phisicke, as followeth. The prepara∣tion of sim∣ples.IT is also very necessarie and conuenient, to knowe the true preparation of diuers and sundrie things and simples, that are vsed in phisicke, and to take away or diminish, or at the least correct that which is and might be hurtful in them, For if this should not be done, they wold oftentimes, by reason either of their sharpnesse or venimous nature, do a great deale more harme than good. Neither shall it be amisse, to shew and declare the nature and properties of the principall simples and drugs in phisicke. What Aloes Hepatica is.Aloëpatica is the iuice of a very sappie hearbe, which groweth in the countries that lie Eastward, and is in tast maruellous bitter. The best is that which glistereth, is light, cleare, like a liuer, without sand or grauell admixed, and as yet cleauing to the skin wherein it is brought. There is another kind of Aloes, called Aloes Caballi∣num, which in colour is very blacke, and not vsed in Phisicke. The vertues of .Aloes is hote in the first, and drie in the third degree, purgeth gall or choler, and waterish flegme. It is corrected two sundrie waies, as followeth: Hisp .Take of very fine powdered and sifted Aloes, as much as thou wilt, put twice as much raine water to it, stir and mixe them well together, let it then rest all a night, that the sand, stones and other filth may fall to the bottome: in the morning after, straine of the clearest, couer it with a linnen cloath, and set it in the hote Sunne, or in some other warme place till it be somewhat dried, then make litle rowles of it. The other manner of washing Aloes is done with spices, thus: Take of Aloes (as afore) powdered and sifted six ounces, of the swéet wood called Cassia Lignea, Spikenard of India, Asar∣rabacca, swéet Cane, Cubebes, Lignum Aloes, Cinnamom, Xylobalsami, Saffron, Mastick, prepared Lacca: of each one ounce and a halfe. Boyle all these together in a glasse or pot in water, vntill all the vertue be boyled out of the ingredients and gone into the water: then straine it through a cloth: after this dissolue your Aloes in this water, stirring it continually, and at the last straine and drie it as is aforesaid. This is called of the Apothecaries Aloe Lota, or washed Aloes, either with or without spices: of this may boldly without any danger be giuen a quarter of an ounce at once. To make burned Allume. How to cal∣cine Allume.Take of the best Allum, as much as thou wilt, beate it not very small, put it into an earthen pot vpon a litle cole of fire, boyle it till it be thicke, white and light, and stir it wel in the boyling: if it were not altogether drie, then take it out by péeces, and lay it in the hote fire, and it will be dried incontinently. AmmoniacumAmmoniacum and such like gums, that cannot be beaten small, and are very vncleane, are clensed as followeth: Put strong vineger vpon them, and let them melt together on the fire, straine and presse them through a strong linnen cloth, to separate péeces of wood, strawe, and whatsoeuer else is with it, let it afterwards boyle till it be thicke, powre it out on a stone that is be-oyled, and make it vp as pleaseth thée best. Oile of oliuesSallet Oyle or Oile of Oliues: it is oftentimes commanded to vse old oile of Oliues: in place of which (if it be not to be had) thou shalt take one part of Oyle and two parts of water, and let them boyle together easily on the fire till the Oyle become as thicke as honie, and so vse it. Others adde more water to their oyle, but that cometh all to one end. Pitch.Pitch is sometimes vsed in forme of powder, and is prepared on this manner: Take one part of Pitch and twentie parts of water, let them boile together in a great pot, til such time, as that the Pitch do no more smell as it was woont to do, and be molten againe together: then let
fall one or two drops vpon a cold stone, and if (it being cold) thou canst rub it to powder be∣twéene thy fingers, it is sufficiently prepared.Turpentine. After the very same manner is also Turpentine Rosine, and such like things prepared.Rosine. Pearles shall be beaten very small, and searced thorow a lawne searce,Pearles. Precious stones. then moule or grinde them on a mortar or marble stone with rose water, vntill thou find or féele no sharpnesse or san∣dinesse betweene thy fingers, then let them drie in such a place where no dust can come at them: On this manner are all other precious stones prepared. Lead being burned to ashes is vsed to many purposes, and it is thus to be burned:Lead calci¦ned. Take as much Lead as thou wilt, put it in a little pipkin, & stop it very close, set it in a potters fornace, there let it glow & burne whiles his pots be a baking, then let it coole: if it be not calcined or bur∣ned inough, lute it and set it in the fornace againe, and so burne it till it be so fine as ashes. Lead is also washed and prepared thus: Take Lead and beate it in a leaden morter,Lead washed. put raine water to it, and beate them both togither a good while till the water begin to be very thicke, and trou∣bled like puddle, straine this through a cloth very well, and let it drie in a warme place. Take Bloudstone which now is in vse at the Apothecaries, is the myne of Quicksiluer:Bloudstone. pow∣der it, and searce it finely, then put it in a mortar, & powre cleare fresh water on it: stir them well togither, and let it settle to the bottome, then powre away the fowle water on the top, and put more cleane water to it, and do as before, till it be cleane washed, but much better it is to wash this stone with plantaine water. The preparation of Bucks bloud is this: In the sommer time whē the sunne is in the Lion,Bucks bloud. thou shalt then take a black bucke or he goate, that is some three or fower yeares old, kéepe him by himself the space of three wéekes, & féede him with nothing else but these herbs, as Smallage (which is so good for the grauel, that of some for that cause it is called the hand of God) Parsley, Mallowes, Pimpinell, Iuie of the oake, Paules Betony Saxifrage, Saxifrage of the wall, and such like herbes with their rootes: Item Straberie leaues, Beane huskes, the lesser branches of the vine: giue him these herbes one after another: Thou shalt also giue him red wine to drinke, but euery third day giue as much faire water as he is able to drinke. Now when he hath thus béen fed three weekes togither, he shall at the first full moone be killed or stucke: The first bloud shalt thou let passe away, and receiue that which is the middlemost or second, drie this in the sunne vntill thou canst powder it: or else if it cannot be done at the sunne, drie it in an ouen, and so reserue it in some drie place, &c. Those that take great delight in distillations, do féede the bucke with meate and drink,The distilla∣tion of bucke bloud. as is before sayd, onely excepted that they giue him no water at all; They take ten pounds of this bloud, & fiue pounds of wine vineger that hath bin twise or thrise distilled, one pound of salt, of Radish, of Cicorie, Pimpinell, of each of them three ounces, Valerian, Cichorie rootes, Ginger, Winter Cherries, white Amber, Sulphur viue that hath bin well washed in wine, Cinnamom, Anniseedes, Fen∣nell seede, Commin seede, Wilde Rape seede, Parsly seede, of each two ounces: of the iuice of Agramo∣nie, Rue, Penniroyall, and of Paules Betonie, of each six dragmes: These things being cut somwhat small, and well mixed togither, they shall be put into a pot close luted and stopped, and buried in horse dung for one fortnight or three wéekes, then distilled in a glasse limbecke: The first wa∣ter that distilleth is very cleare, & so soone as the colour of the water altereth, thou shalt change thy recipient or receiuer: this iterate in changing of recipients as often as thou séest the colour of that which distilleth to change. Others distill it all ouer togither into one receiuer, and after∣ward reiterate or repeate their distillations twise or thrise, till neither the tast nor the smell do offend them: In the first and second distillation ascendeth also some oyle with the water, which shal be let alone with the liquor: and albeit the liquor do séeme nothing troubled or thicke, thou shalt not regard that, for it is but so much the stronger. This liquor and oyle togither, if it be kept close stopped, remaineth good and vertuous two or thrée yeares after the first making of it. Of this mayest thou giue at one time two dragmes, or half an ounce in wine or meade, against grauell and dropsies before meate: it doth also wonderfully prouoke sweate. Bolus Armenus or Bole Armenacke, is a red stone or earth that is brought from Armenia:Bole Arme∣nacke. This hath an especiall vertue to purge melancholie: the waight of a crown at once is sufficient, for it purgeth somewhat violently: but if it be washed, thou mayest exhibite the waight of two crownes at one time, for then purgeth it gently. Beate as much of this Bole as thou wilt, powre vpon it Rhenish or French wine, or faire
water, stir and mixe them well together, let it settle againe, powre off the humiditie or water, or wine, and put on fresh and stir it againe as before: this do as long as thy water cometh co∣loured from it, which will be some sixteene or twentie times: after this, wash it yet tenne times with rose water. Some there be that do adde such things as do comfort and strengthen the hart, which in very deede is not to be misliked. Camfire.Camfire will in no wise be beaten to powder, except it be rubbed and chafed in a morter, in the which morter hath first bene beaten some péece or part of an almon or almons, according to the quantitie of Camfire which thou wilt prepare. Caia.Cassia which is in the pipe, quill, or cane, is one of the best purging medicines, and is suffici∣ently knowne. The best pipes are chosen by waight, & in which the kernels do not rattle, which is a sure signe that the pith or marrow in them is succulent and moist, and nothing withered or dried. It is vsed on this manner: Take as many of the pipes as pleaseth thée, beate vpon them softly from one end to the other vntill they rend or split asunder, take out all that is in it with a knife into a hairen strainer, & lay it ouer a boyling pot of water, that the hot vapor may come to it: When the Cassia is reasonable warme, take off the hairen strayner or sieue, hold it ouer a dish, and with a round pestell squise it thorough the strainer, and all the black pith will passe thorough and hang on the outside of the strainer, which thou shalt scrape off with a knife, and kéepe it: then set thy sieue or strainer ouer the boyling water, as is aforesaid, and afterwardes squise it thorough againe as at the first. This worke shalt thou do againe so long, till no more pith passe thorough, and nothing but kernels remaine in thy strainer: this prepared Cassia is called by the Apothecaries Cassia cribrata. Note, that when thou wilt vse this Cassia, it must alwaies be new taken out of the pipes: for being reserued out of the pipe, presently it waxeth sower, and especially in the sommer time. Of this strained Cassia maist thou exhibite at one time one ounce, or one ounce and a halfe, in hot burning agues vnto children and women in child bed, to euery of them more or lesse, as they are able to beare. Also if thou wilt haue this Cassia to purge more effectually, then put either the blossomes or leaues of the Peach trée in the boyling water, before thou hold thy Cassia ouer the vapor of it. The vertue of Cassia is, to purifie and cleare the bloud, to quench thirst, and to allay heat, being taken with Endiue water; also to purge the stomacke, to driue out choler and flegme without any danger: for it hath no sharpnesse or corroding vertue in it. In like sort it is very comforta∣ble for the brest and liuer, and is very good for the kidneys, being mixed with the appropriate waters that driue out grauell, and beaten Licorise, then ministred, it doth scowre away the gra∣uell, and hindreth the growing of the stone. It is vsed in a confection with Manna, and it is al∣so prepared for Clisters. Coloquint.Coloquint is a very bitter apple, and is oftentimes sowne in gardens for pleasure sake, yet it is found very seldome to be ripe. The vse of that which is brought vs from Ʋenice or other pla∣ces, is this, and no otherwise. The innumerable white kernels being cast away, the rest shall be beaten very small, and sifted thorow a very fine searce, and so be brought to as fine a powder as possible may be: when it is wet, it swelleth as if it had neuer bene powdered: and for that cause it is straightly charged to be reduced into so fine a dust: for if neuer so little a peece should by chaunce remaine in the stomacke or guts, it would easily excoriate and hurt them, so that hereby the sinewes might take some harme, yea lamenesse and crampes ensue of it. The right preparation of it is this that followeth. Take of the aforesaid fine powdered Coloquint two ounces and a halfe, rub it a great while with two ounces of oile of Roses, then take of the gum Tragacanth, of gum Arabicke, of Bdellium, of each of them ℥.ss. stéepe them in a litle rose water vntill they be dissolued: put of this mixture vnto the beaten Coloquint, and forme little cakes of it, let them drie, beate them small againe, and fashion your cakes againe with the gum water, and kéepe them: On this wise prepared are they more safe than the crude Coloquint, and are called Throcisci Alandali: To what end they be vsed in phisicke, shall be shewed hereafter. This prepared Coloquint may be exhibited from ℈. j. to ℈. j. ss. ℈. ij. but it purgeth vehement∣ly, it draweth the tough flegmaticall humors from the head and other parts. Coloquint is supposed of some to be hote and drie in the second: of others, in the third degrée. Corrall.Corrall both red and white is prepared in that manner as is aforesaid of the Pearles.
Coriander séede being hurtfull vnto the braine, both by his hot nature & by his strong smell,Coriander seedes. is verie profitable for many vses: ye shall correct it as followeth. Stéepe it the space of twelue howers in good strong wine vineger: afterward euaporate or drie away your vineger from it in a warme place, then it is prepared. Black Coriander is the séed of Nigella,Nigella seedes. and is prepared as that aboue sayd. Dates both swéete and sower do purge very easily, especially in hot diseases & great drithes:Dates. being prest close togither as they are brought vnto vs, they are kept good a long time: you may minister of them from two ounces to fower at once. They néede no preparing or correcting at all, for that they purge so gently, and can do no harme. Gems or precious stones are prepared as is aforesayd of pearles.Gems. Horsleaches, the bloud sucking water worme,Horsleaches. shall be kept some dayes in fresh water before they be vsed: putting a little bloud and bran into the water for their food, then do they lose their venome. Scoria ferri, the refuse of iron, shalt thou cast into faire water: wash it,Scoria ferri, Refuse of iron. and let it settle to the bottome, powre of the water from it vntil it remaine verie cleane and pure, afterward put it in an earthen pot that is well leaded or glassed within: put as much vineger to it as will wet it onely, and not ouerflow it: let them stand so both togither the space of thirtie dayes, in the meane while oftentimes stirring them: afterward moule or grinde them on a marble, as thou didst the pearles. Polipodium, little ferne or polipodie doth willingly grow on old wals and mossie stones,Polipodie. but the best groweth on okes: it purgeth gall and slimie superfluities: it is somwhat hurtfull to the stomacke, it is therefore corrected with Annise séedes, Fennell seedes, Cloues, Cumine seedes, and is administred either with hony water, or else with the water of grapes, and very seldome by it selfe alone. Epithymus, Dodder is vsed in many profitable medicines:Dodder. the gold coloured and strong smel∣ling Dodder is the best: foure dragmes of it in powder, or at the most six, driueth out melancho∣lie and choler. It is almost neuer giuen by it selfe, but alwayes admixed with other things, but specially it is sodden in drinkes or potions, at which time thou mayest vse one ounce at once. It is put in last of all into the boiling potion. The iuice of wild Cucumbers (called in Gréeke Elaterium) is pressed out of the wild Cucum∣bers: the Phisitions commaund that it should not be vsed till it be two yeares old,Elaterium, it may be kept ten yeares togither, the older it is, the better: and when it is moistened it is like vnto milk: being put to the fire, it doth presently burne. It purgeth flegme, water, and all superfluous hu∣midities most violently, and in like sort gall and choler also. It ought not to be vsed vnaduised∣ly, or without the counsell of a skilfull Phisition, for that an error might be committed in a few graines. Euphorbium, is a strange gum so called,Euphorbium. amongst all the purging simples the strongest and hottest, verie sharpe and biting on the tong, it seemeth to burne in the nostrils, and prouoketh néesings, it stoppeth the breth, as if it would choke one, if the dust of it be receiued. Therefore great héed is to be giuen: for two or thrée dragmes of it is ranke poyson. In extreme diseases of flegme and dropsies, when no other remedies will helpe, thou mayest vse it from foure graines vnto twelue, but no more: Masticke and Spike of India do greatly diminish his hurting quali∣tie. The ancient Phisitions did minister it with meade or honie water. Sewets and marrowes of sundry beasts are prepared as followeth:Sewets. Marrowes. First wash them cleane and often in cold water, then chop & melt them togither with a little fire in a seuerall pot with boiling water and wine, or else with rose water: after this presse & straine them thorow a cloth, and kéepe it in a vessell or pot of pewter in a cold place. The marrow must especially be taken out of the bones in the beginning of winter. Iuorie is thus prepared: take of it in quantitie as you please: cut it in thin chips,Iuorie. put them into a new pot, and stop him close with a pot lid that is vnbaked: put him into a potters fornace amongst other pots to be burned. When your pot is cold, take out your Iuorie, beate it to a small dust or powder, and searce it thorow a fine hairen searce: put it into a leaded or glassed pot, powring as much rose water on it till it be cleane couered. Afterwardes, take for euerie twelue ounces of Iuorie half an ounce of Camfere: moule or grind them on a marble togither, and when it is hard like dow, forme or make little square cakes of it called Trochises: kéepe
them in a glasse well stopped, that they lose not their smel. Note also, that if thy pot he not very closly luted and couered, that thy Iuory cannot be burned white, and that it loseth a great deale of his vertue. This is vsed against all manner of poysons. Hermoda∣ctils.Hermodactils, some suppose it to be our Daffodils, and indeed I do take it to be a kind of them, but the Gréekes do call their Hermodactilon, Ephemeron, and Colchicon, of the place where it grow∣eth. And although this roote may kill a man in one day (as also our Daffodils do excitate a fluxe or laske in the belly euen till the very bloud do follow) yet hath it his vse, as in other places shal be shewed. This roote shall be digged vp out of the earth in the beginning of the sommer, and those that are sappiest and whitest within, shall be reserued. Those that are withered and soft, haue lost their vertue: such as grow in wet, watrish and low ground, are verie venemous. And albeit that they be verie cleane and drie, yet shall they not be vsed in halfe a yeare, and are verie seldome in request. One dragme, or one dragme and a halfe at the most is sufficient at one time. Cinnamom, Ginger, Mastix, long Pepper do greatly correct their venemous qualitie: they are giuen in the vineger of Squils, honie of Roses, or Oximel. Hartshorne. .Hartshorne is prepared as is aforesayd of Iuorie. Lacca the gum or sap so called, do we not vse verie often, notwithstanding that, we will not passe ouer her preparation, which is as followeth: Take of Hartwort, of Fenegreeke, of each one ounce: boile them in a sufficient quantitie of water, vntill the fourth part be consumed, and that there remaine but ten ounces: being strained, put into this liquor eight ounces of the a∣foresayd Lacca, boyle them togither on a little fire, till the water become as red as bloud, and all the best of the gum be dissolued in the water: then straine it thorow a cloth, and let your bloudy liquor boile in a glasse in water, till it become thick vnto a sirupe, and more thicker and harder: make it vp into little cakes, and drie them. Agaricus.Agaricus, a kinde of well knowne Mushrome: the white, compacted light and soft, is al∣wayes the best: that which is hollow, full of holes and blacke, is reiected. The one is taken to be the male, and the other the female kinde: the best is at the first in tast swéete, but presently af∣terwards very bitter. Being giuen by it selfe, one dragme or one dragme and a halfe, is inough at once: but being boiled in drinks, or other decoctions, thou maiest vse halfe an ounce. It is hot in the first, and drie in the second degrée. It doth purge tough flegme, and openeth all obstructi∣ons. When thou wilt administer it, thou shalt adde a litle salt Gem and Ginger to it, also Oxi∣mel and honie of Roses, by the which his venemous qualitie is verie much delayed. The Apo∣thecaries do diuersly prepare this Agaricus, as followeth: Take of it as much as thou wilt, cut it small, mole or rub it in a mortar (for it will not be beaten to powder) make it in forme of a dow with wine, in which ginger hath beene steeped eight or ten howers, and then make little cakes or Trochiscos of it. The other manner of preparing is this: Take Malmesey or Muscadell fower ounces, vineger of Squils three dragmes, white ginger two dragmes, Spike of India halfe a dragme let them boyle togither with a soft fire: straine it, and stéepe in this liquor thrée ounces of the beaten Agaricus, but not too fine powdered, and let it stand and drie verie well in a glassed pot; & when it is almost drie, make little cakes of it with the flime of Polipodie. They purge the head and the brest of superfluous and stinking humidities, they are called at the Apo∣thecaries Trocisci de Agarico. Manna.Manna may we call (as it is indéed) a deaw of heauē, séeing that this precious liquor falleth in the morning with the deaw from heauen. This is now in great quantitie & very good brought vnto vs out of Calabria, situated beyond Italie. The best is that which is a little yellow, and somewhat perspicuous, or cleare like Masticke, in tast swéete, and without any filth admixed. This Manna is an easie, harmlesse, cooling and fine purging medicine, which may be giuen to women in childbed & to yong children, with distilled waters, or any broth of meate, from one ounce and a halfe vntill two ounces and more at once; when it is moulten in the waters, on hot coales, straine it thorow a cloth, that all the vncleannesse might be separated. It needeth no cor∣rection, for it hath no venemous or bad qualitie at all with it. Mirobolani.Mirobolani, these are strange fruits, of the which there are fiue sorts: of some of them are the rindes or barkes dried: of others is the whole substance dried and brought vnto vs. All of them do purge and draw tough flegme from the head; they drie the braine, &c. But euery one of them hath an especiall and seuerall vertue, which ought to be noted. Curini, these are yellow, hauing a thicke skin or rinde with a hard stone or stonie kernell.
They purge cholericke and hot humors. Emblici do comfort and drie the braine, and are confected or preserued. Bellirici haue the same vertues with the first. Kebuli are big, blacke and somewhat long, darke and of a Chestnut colour: the heauiest and thickest of rind are the best. They purge flegme, and may also be preserued. Indi, of these are the barkes onely brought vnto vs, which are in colour blacke, for which cause they are also called Nigri: they are waightie as the others also are: they do purge melan∣cholie. The powder of either of them by it selfe (which is not vsuall) may be giuen the weight of one dragme or twaine: they be commonly vsed with an admixtion of many things: with Almonds, Currants, Fennell séedes, Spike of India, in the whay of goates milke, and the iuice of Fumi∣torie, they may very meetely be administred. Neesewoort, of this are two sortes or kindes, the white and the blacke,Neesewort. and it is concluded a∣mongst Phisitions, that the best time to gather them is the time of haruest: they purge both vp∣ward and downward, and must therefore be very warily vsed: yea if it be possible it is good to refraine from them altogither. The whiter that one of them is, the better it is: it ought also to be soft, vnperished, and not too sharpe or biting on the tong. With this roote haue auncient Phi∣sitions done great maruels, and haue had many strange opinions of it, that it should strengthen memorie, sharpen the wit, and should be very commodious against the falling sicknesse. They compare it to a captaine, who placing his souldiers to the battell, is himselfe the first that forsa∣keth the field. Both of them may be vsed, but (as is aboue sayd) with great circumspection; for that they be venemous, as presently appeareth in the digging of them vp: for if the sent of them chance to ascend into the face and nostrils of the digger, it doth gréeuously disturbe his braine, and causeth both a great paine and swelling to follow: And for this cause shall they be digged vp in hast, & he that diggeth them shall stand with his backe to the wind, that the smell of them may not annoy him; and before he begin to dig he shall eate garlicke, and drinke some wine. The white Néesewoort purgeth verie violently by vomite, & is not so hurtfull for beasts as it is for man; of neither of them may be giuen aboue a dragme at a time, and that in no wise vnpre∣pared, that the patient be not choked with it. It is corrected by the addition of pepper, Parsley séede, Anniséedes, Marierome, and wild Mints. The blacke Neesewoort killeth horses, oxen & hogs, and purgeth by stoole. In fine, these rootes may the ancient Phisitions praise as highly as they list, yet it is forbidden that neither women nor old men, nor children, nor men of a weake constitution, nor those that haue a short breath should in any wise vse them. To what other vses they are put, shall be shewed hereafter. Opium is the iuice of a strange kinde of poppie dried, being too much vsed it killeth by sléepe:Opium. it hath a strong and vnpleasant smell, which may be corrected as followeth: take a little paire of tongs, which is somwhat broad before, make it red hot, hold a little péece of Opium in it, and lay it downe againe presently, and so do as much as thou wilt. Rhabarbarum, Rubarbe,Rubarbe. how far this precious roote is estéemed aboue all other purging sim∣ples, shall openly appeare in this booke. The best is that which is without, of a Chestnut and darkish colour, but commonly that which is brought vnto vs hath the rind taken off, & is yel∣low coloured. That is also commended which is reasonable heauie, in the breaking spongious, and not hard, verie red, with white specks, also that which hath yellow spots, and in chewing coloureth like Saffron. The preparatiō of it is very easie, for that it is so harmlesse that it may be vsed without any addition, yet do Phisitions commonly vse to adde to euery dragme of Ru∣barbe thrée or fower graines of Spikenard, Squinanth, or swéete Cane, or Masticke, and most fittest with whay of goates milke; in the winter time with wine the weight of one dragme, or one dragme and a halfe being finely powdered; but stéeped, two or thrée dragmes, according to the state and abilitie of the patient. The saps or iuices of herbes, flowers and rootes, for sirupes and other compositions,Iuices. are thus prepared: Presse out your iuice into an earthen pot, let it boile on ye fire thrée or fower bubbles; then let it settle from the fire, til al the thickest drosse be sunke to the bottome powre of the clea∣rest from the top by inclination, which onely shall be reserued and vsed, casting away the vn∣pure setlings. Wilde Saffron, or Carthamus is verie offensiue for the stomacke,Wild saffron and is hot in the third
degrée. Of this is vsed the innermost part or kernell of the seed, it purgeth all superfluous humi∣dities, dropsies and flegme. It is giuen to the weight of halfe an ounce in barly water sodden, & well expressed, but not without the admixtion of such things as do comfort the stomacke. It is also vsed to other intents, as hereafter in this booke shall appeare. Scammoni.Scammonie or Scammonia, is a strange iuice, and vsed in many compositions & purging me∣dicines, to increase and sharpen their purging qualitie: the best Scammonie is brought to vs from Asia: when it is prepared, it is called Diagridion. It is giuen frō foure graines vnto twelue at the most in one day, or at one time. The best is discerned by that, that it is blacke, leane, or not gummy, shining, and with many little holes, much like vnto bread; and as soone as it is tou∣ched with the tong, that presently becommeth milkie white, not sharpe or biting, not sandy, not heauie or weightie, and verie brittle. In the second yeare is Scammonie in her flower and most vertue: afterward doth it decay, and waxeth obsolete and old. It is thus prepared: Take two ounces of Scammonie, powder it verie finely in a morter, put a little oyle of Ireos to it, to bring it to the consistence of dow: then make hollow a Quince, in which thou shalt put thy Scam∣monie, and stop the hole with a péece of a Quince verie close; wrap the Quince in dow, and let it bake in an ouen. Afterward take one ounce of yellow Myrobalans, steepe them fower and twentie howers in two ounces of the iuice of Quinces, setting it on warme ashes; then presse them very hard thorow a cloth, mingle it with the Scammony, and let it dry in a warme place. Some men do admixe some Mastick with it; others take nothing else but the iuice of Quinces: but the former preparation is that which is commonly vsed. Iuice of Sloes.The iuice of Sloes is euerie where taken and vsed likewise for the strange sap Acatia, yet it doth not agree in all points with the vertues of Acatia. The true Acatia is the sap of the trée, from which the gum Arabeck is taken. Notwithstanding if any man would make a mixture that might haue the same vertues with Acatia, Valerius Cordus doth teach it him thus: Take the kernels of sower Dates, séede of Sumach, of each one pound: bruise them, and put vpon them three or fower pints of raine water: let them stéepe togither fower and twentie howers, then straine them thorow a cloth, boyle that is strained till one third remaine, clarifie it with the white of egs, set it on the coales againe, and let it boyle softly, till it be as thicke as the iuice of Sloes, which then may boldly be vsed. .Brimstone is thus prepared: Melt thy Sulphur or Brimstone at the fire, then powre it into the water of Lettice: this reiterate eight or nine times: when it is dry, beate it to powder. This is commonly vsed to stop the bloud, as hereafter shall be shewed. Sene leaues.Sene leaues with the huskes and their séede is a common purgation for euerie man, for that it purgeth all bad humours, and especially choler and flegme. Great store of it is brought from Florence. It is also set in our gardens, but the verie best is brought from Alexandria. The huskes of them are of more force and vertue than the leaues. Two dragms of them in powder is a sufficient dose at once: but either stéeped or sod, an ounce is little inough, as in this booke shall appeare. They are corrected with Ginger or salt Gem: and may be giuen in the decoction of Borage Buglosse, Violets, Mastix, Cloues, and Cardimonie, or else being powdered, may any of these be admixed with them, and so exhibited. White Mu∣stard seede.White Mustard séede may in no wise be inwardly vsed, except it be first corrected as follow∣eth: Stéepe it one day and a night in good Aqua vitae, and then euaporate or drie it away from it: then powre vpon it fresh Aqua vitae, that hath bene made of the best Malmesey, or of some other strong wine with Lauander flowers in it: then let it stand and soke as before, and afterwards also euaporate: then is thy séede prepared. This seede may be made vp in Sugar, or confected and so vsed, or by it selfe but very little of it at once. It is verie good to be mingled with any sto∣machical powder: it drieth vp all moistures of the braine, it helpeth the swimming in the head, falling euill, and the dead palsie: but vnprepared may it in no way be vsed. .Mezercon▪ of some Spurge, or Chamelaea, of the Apothecaries Coccognidion. The auncient Phi∣sitions were wont to giue seuen or eight of the séedes of it, wrapped vp in a greene fig or date; but experience doth teach vs, that thrée of the séedes are sufficient inough to purge the bodie. Sops of bread may be vsed in stead of the figs or daies: for it is onely done to the intent, that they by reason of their extreme heat should not harme the throte. They also commanded a good draught of water to be presently drunke after them. But flie the vse of such medicines, which are described for none other cause, than that we might know & shun them: let Empericks and
the outcasts of phisicke vse them. Take the filings of Stéele, cast them into faire water,Steele. rub them well betwéene thy hands in the water, powre away the vncleane water from thy Stéele remaining on the bottome: this washing reiterate so often, that the water come cleare from it. Then put the Stéele into a well glassed earthen pot, powre strong wine vineger vpon it, as much as will onely moisten it and not couer it: let them so stand together thirtie dayes, but in the mean while oftentimes stirring it; afterward beate it to powder, and mole it on a marble, as is before said of the pearles. Turbith is the barke of a roote, and at the Apothecaries well knowne and very common,Turbith. for that it is added vnto many purging confections. It is thought to be a kind of Wolfes-bane. It is giuen in powder from one dragme vnto two at once; but being decocted, halfe an ounce eue∣rie time. It purgeth flegme mightily. All his maliciousnesse is corrected by the addition of one third part of Ginger, and so, either with honie of Roses, or the water of grapes, exhibited. When it is vsed in powder, it must not be beaten very small. Tutia, Tuttie is commonly vsed for the eyes,Tuttie. and in all kind of infirmities where exsiccation is required, and is thus prepared: Make it red hote in a Goldsmiths crusible or melting cruse: then extinguish it in the vrine of a male child: this reiterate the seuenth time, afterwardes also fiue times in Fennell water: then powder it as thou didst the pearles. Item glow it, as is now said, fiue or sixe times, and euer cast it into rosewater, and powder it as aboue. This is the com∣mon preparation of Tutia. Wolfes-liuer must be taken fresh out of the wolfe, and be washed with good warme wine:Wolfes liuer. cut it into little péeces, put it into a pot, and set it into a warme bakers ouen: kéepe it in a drie place well wrapped in wormwood, lest the wormes do spoile it. Esula, is taken for the roote onely at the Apothecaries. It is a strong purging roote,Esula. and ought not to be vsed vnaduisedly: being prepared, not aboue the waight of a dragme or lesse, as occa∣sion serueth. There be seauen kinds of it called Tithymalus, and are all more fit to be vsed out∣ward, then inward in the bodie. It purgeth choler and melancholie. Take either the bigger or the lesser rootes of Esula, stéepe them foure and twentie houres in wine vineger, and let them dry againe. When thou wilt vse them, cut off and cast away all the hairie and hard parts of them, and beate the rest to fine powder. The seede of Palma Christi or Ricinus, being purified,Palma Christi seeds. doth by his purging vertue driue out choler and flegme. The auncient Phisitions do command not aboue ten in number at once to be exhibited: but because they are very greatly hurtfull to the stomacke, they shall in no wise be vsed: but in place of them, other things which are lesse hurtfull. There is a false opinion amongst the common sort of this Palma Christi, to wit, that if the séede in the gathering of it be plucked vpward, it prouoketh vomit: if it be plucked downward, it should mooue stooles; but howsoeuer they be gathered, by reason of their venimous and hurtfull qualitie, they may purge both vp∣wards and downwards. Laureole, Daphnoidis, and Laureola, Laurell. These leaues haue a sharpe purging qualitie,Laurell. to driue out flegme and choler. Of the powder of them prepared may be taken from foure grains vnto sixe and no more: and with other spices and simples corrected, not aboue one dragme. There is nothing of it in vse, but onely the leaues: it is prepared by stéeping of it foure and twentie houres in wine vineger, and then dried. Sugar is vsed in many things, as hereafter in this booke may appeare,Sugar. but to boyle it there be diuers and sundrie wayes: and first of al shall be shewed, how the common and course Sugar must be seuered from his filth and dregs, and clarified for sirupes, and other necessaries in phi∣sicke. Take (for example) two pounds of common Sugar, put it into a certaine quantitie of water:How to cla∣rifie Sugar. set it on the fire vntill it be readie to boyle or séethe: then haue in a readinesse the white of fiue egges, beaten to water with a litle rod, and sprinkle them with thy rod into thy boiling Sugar: let it boyle afterwards a pretie while, then doth the filth of the Sugar adioyne himselfe to the whites of the egs: then set it from the fire, and when it ceaseth boiling, take away the filth from it with a skimmer, boile it againe, besprinkle it, and skim it as before, so often, vntill thou find it bright and cleare. For sirupes and other confections let this Sugar boile somewhat longer, let two or thrée drops of it fall on a cold stone, dip thy finger in them, and sée if it do string or glue or draw out in a threed, which is a signe of a sufficient cocture.
Manus ChristiFor to make Sugar cakes or Manus Christi, the foresayd Sugar must boile yet longer: and if thou wilt know if it be sufficiently boiled for this thy purpose, take a litle of it on spattens or skimmer, and throw it from thée into the aire: if it flie very white and fierie from it, then is it boyled enough: set it from the fire, stirring it continually vntill it begin to be stiffe or hard, then adde and mixe those things with it, which thou wilt: then very spéedily cast it on a cold stone, whereupon a litle flower hath bene cast or sifted before, lest they should sticke or cleaue fast to the stone. Saccharum Penidium, called Sugar pennets, is best made of the whitest sugar that is brought from the yland of S. Thomas. Take of this (if thou canst tell how to worke it) from two vntill fiue pounds at once, powre vpon it a good pretie quantitie of water, and if it be very vncleane, clarifie it as afore, continue the boyling easily vntill it begin to be thicke, and that it rise vp in great bubbles: then haue a spindle or the like litle round sticke being wet with cold water, thrust it into the boyling sugar about a fingers breadth, that some of thy sugar may cleaue to it, and coole it in cold water: if then it easily come from thy spindle or sticke, if it be reasonable hard, and if in the biting or chewing it sticke and cleaue not to thy teeth, then it is readie to be wrought: Take it from the fire, let the bubbles settle themselues, powre it out vpon a stone or table, that is moistened all ouer with the oyle of Oliues: when it is run flat or abroad, take vp the ends, corners, or edges of it, and throw them vpon the middest of it: this continue, vntill such time as it all do remaine in a heape or lumpe: then dippe thy hands in fine floure lest the sugar sticke to them; hang or fasten the whole lumpe of sugar vpon a strong hooke or crooked naile fastened in a wall, and drawe one part of thy sugar towards thée about a cubits length: fasten the end in thy hand on the hooke againe, and pull againe; thus continue pulling and fastening, vntill thy Sugar become very white. There must at the least be a couple to work it, that the one being wearie, the other may go forward with it; besides that, by reason of the great heate of the sugar, it is not possible that one should doe it well alone. Now when it waxeth white and cold, thou shalt draw it out in long ropes, and lay them on a table whereupon a lit∣tle flower is sprinkled, and so make it vp in rowles. This whole worke must be done in hast: for otherwise the sugar will waxe too hard, which notwithstanding, it is not spoiled: But if thou wilt bring it into Sugar pennets againe, it will be somewhat blacker than otherwise it would be. This shall suffice at this present concerning the principall purging simples, and after what sort they are best prepared and corrected: and those things that haue as yet not bene spoken of, shall hereafter (as néede shall require) be shewed and intreated of at large. Addition. Succus rosarum, the iuice of Roses, or their infusion, purgeth choler gently, and cooleth withall. It may be giuen from one vnto two ounces very safely. Serum lactis, whay of milke or of cheese, is a lenitiue and laxatiue medicine, it doth also purge choler. It is exhibited from three vnto fiue ounces. Mechoacha (in English Mechecan) is an Indian roote, of some called white Rubarbe. It may be taken in substance from two scruples vnto one dragme with broth, wormewood wine, or sweet wine, as followeth: Take Mechecan one dragme, Gentian one scruple, Cinnamom halfe a scruple, beate them into a fine powder, and exhibite it three howers before meales with wormewood wine. It purgeth flegme and waterish humours without any molestation or trouble vnto the patient. It is giuen for the paine in the head, that hath continued long; for agues, for the collicke, for the drop∣sie, and for the shortnesse of the breath. Opopanax is the iuice of the herbe Ferula. The best is white within and yellow without, bit∣ter, brittle, and of a strong sent. It is commonly giuen from one vnto two dragmes. It euacuateth the grosse and tough fleagme that is inherent in the braine, nerues, breast and ioynts. Sagapenum is a certaine iuice or gum so called, of a darke yellow colour, white within and strong in tast. It may be giuen from halfe a dragme vnto a whole, with the water of Rue, or of
Elecampane. It doth in like maner purge grosse and tough humours. Both these gummes are cor∣rected with Masticke and Spica, &c. Taken out of Dioscorides, Mathiolus, Weereus, and others. The seuenth Chapter. §. 1. A generall rule to be obserued in purging. FOrasmuch as the especiallest point in sanation is to vnburden the bodie of man of abounding superfluities,A rule for purging. and cleanse it of all corruption and vncleannesse; which indéed may be done, either by prescribing a mode∣rate diet in meate and drinke, by leading a well ruled life, or rather if in these any thing be wanting, by purgations: Therefore it séemeth néed∣full here to set downe a generall rule, which euery man is to obserue and kéepe, that purposeth to purge, as thus: He must haue a great regard of the nature of the disease, of the diseased, of his age, of the time of the yeare, and such like. And where (as it is alreadie sayd) all sicknesses and inward griefes do procéede of corruption of the bloud and bad humours, (as in this our worke doth appeare,) necessitie therefore doth require that such superfluities and corruptions should be expelled and banished out of the bodie, which for the most part is perfected by dry∣ing or purging medicines, whereof now shall be mentioned. The best counsell therefore is, that not vnaduisedly, but very warily thou meddle with strong medicines. For as in all infir∣mities purgings are very needful and profitable, so also the vse of bad and too strong purgations is very hurtfull and dangerous. Wherefore in sharpe and perillous diseases shall the aduice of a learned Phisition be asked, or else in his absence to choose and vse things that are easie and safe, of which in this booke euery where mayest thou haue choise. What persons shall abstaine from purging, and the impediments thereof. §. 2. ALL such as vse a moderate diet,What persons are to refraine from purging and eate nothing but that which ingendreth good bloud, they haue no néed of any purgation. Those that do abound in bloud, may in like sort omit purging: but good it is for them to be let bloud. If any matter or bad humour do settle it selfe in the concauitie or hollow∣nesse of the articles or ioynts, and is inherent, as in the Leprie, and such like happeneth, in vaine it is also for them to purge; for if such humours be mooued onely, and not wholly expelled, they might easily be drawne to some noble and principall part of the body, whereby the diseased might be greatly weakened, and fall into a worse incouenience than before. In great heate or cold mayest thou not purge, for the heate diuideth and spreadeth the matter ouer all the body, and weakeneth greatly: at which time if thou purge, thou doest stir and moue the humor, and doest ouerthrow the strength of nature. In great cold is the matter tough and thicke, and altogether vnapt for Phisicke to worke vpon. It is also forbidden in weake persons, whether their weaknesse procéed from nature or some other accidentall cause, to purge strongly, although gentle purgations for their ease in some sort be allowed. Hote and drie natures must forbeare purgings, for all purging medicines for the most part are hote and drie, and by that meanes do they augment heate and drought, and hurt the bodie.
Very nice and daintie persons shall not take any strong purgation, for in them are the hu∣mours easily moued. In like sort might fat bodies, which commonly are but weake, by strong purgations incurre the danger of stifling. Young children and old men shall shunne purgations: and those also that labour much, and cary great burdens: for they are alwayes weary, which is contrary to all purgations. What is to be obserued in and after the taking of a purgation. §. 3. , and after purguing.AFter the taking of a purge, is a moderate motion vp and downe, and stirring of the armes commodious, that the matter fall and remaine not all vpon an heape in the body. But if thou feare that thou shalt cast vp the purgation, thou shalt be at rest and quiet till thy stomacke be stayed. If the purgation that thou hast taken be gentle, and a little potion or drinke, thou shalt forbeare to sleepe after it: but vpon hard or solide me∣dicines, as pils, tabulats, and such like, is sléepe and rest graunted, that by the inward and naturall heate the substance of the pilles might the sooner be dissolued and dispersed. The purgation being taken, it is not amisse to vse some sower thing after it, as a Pomegra∣nate, vnripe Grapes, Oranges, &c. for that strengtheneth the stomacke, that it draweth no ill humor to it, and it stayeth all the vomiting. It is also good after the taking of any purgation to drinke a draught of whay or warme béere; it helpeth the operation of the medicine, and dulleth her sharpnesse. It is also good to kéepe the belly warme, least by force he draw away the medi∣cine from the stomack. To this end is nothing more commodious than warme water to set thy féete in, for that warmeth all the bodie. The belly may also be couered with a little bagge, and some bran in it. When the medicine beginneth to purge, it is not much amisse to mooue the bodie somewhat: for by that motion descendeth it downewards, and all the harme or badnesse which the medicine hath with it, is thereby taken away: the motion helpeth also to expell the humors. Whilest the medicine doth yet purge, thou shalt neither eate nor drinke, least it hinder the operation thereof. Notwithstanding if the patient cannot forbeare so long, let him vse the broth of a hen, or some such like thing, or else the sirupe of Violets, to delay the heate of the stomacke, and to preserue him from an ague. For a great quantity of choler being drawne into the sto∣macke by reason of hunger, might easily cause such an accident as might be very hurtful for the diseased. Secondly, if a great hunger should ouertake him, he may boldly take a péece of a toast and dip it in good wine, or any such like liquor, but not so much in quantity, that the medicine might be hindered of her operation. Sleepe after the operation of the purge is permitted: for as the purge doth weaken and distem∣per the body, so doth rest and sleepe strengthen it againe. After thy sleepe thou shalt make but a small and easie meale: for considering that the natural powers and vertues of the body be somewhat weakned, they might by too much and too hasty eating be quite ouerthrowne: so that this is a generall rule; The more the medicine hath purged, the lesse ought to be eaten after it. The next day after purging, is good to bathe in warme water, if at the least the féeble estate of the patient do not disswade from it: for thereby are the relikes that are left after purging moistened and digested, and it suppleth also the drie body. On the third day shall a veine be opened, by the which the vapors (of the humors that were mooued and expelled) are taken away, which otherwise would be no small hurt vnto the body. This shall suffice as concerning the rules and ordinances that ought to be obserued in purging.

The eight Chapter. §. 1. Of Phlebotomie in generall. PhlebotomieTHe health of man is no lesse maintained, and being in decay re∣stored by right vse of Phlebotomie, than by purging; and there∣fore ought it not at this present time to be passed ouer in silence. As concerning euery particular disease and causes of it, shall hereafter particularly be mention made. First, one that is in in good health néedeth neither boxing nor cupping, nor the letting of bloud. Also the Phlebotomie is fruitlesse to such as haue so strong a nature, that (being ouerladen) is able to expell all superfluities through naturall passa∣ges, as by bléeding at the nose, by the piles or hemorhoides, by the flowers in women, and such like: to such is nothing else to be done, but to ayde nature in opening of those passages that shée hath chosen to ease her selfe by. But now might some man aske this question; Why, or for what cause is Phlebotomie vsed? Where∣unto may thus be answered: When the aboue-named naturall euacuations haue not their course, then are there foure reasons why this letting of bloud might be vsed. First, when bloud aboundeth, as commonly in those that haue a hote liuer, full veines, a high colour and brow∣nish, and are not too fat and corpulent: also in those that eate and drinke abundantly, liue at ease, and that vse meates that ingender much bloud; which when nature cannot altogether digest, doth smother, rot and corrupt in the veines; from which dangerous and deadly diseases do ensue. Wherefore if phlebotomie be in due season adhibited, it hath these commodities with it: First, that the whole bodie, or the part affected, may more surely by this meanes then by administration of inward Phisicke be eased. For in the letting of bloud, being ruled by art, thou mayest draw as little as thou wilt, and as much as séemeth néedfull; which in purging can in no wise be done: for that which is taken into the bodie, that remaineth there, whether it be too much or too little, whether it do good or euill. Furthermore, Phlebotomie doth strengthen the braine, comfort the sight, warmeth the cold marrow in the bones, freeth the inward parts of many infirmities, stayeth vomiting, helpeth also oftentimes the flixe or laxe, cleareth the sen∣ses, restoreth sleepe, reuiueth the spirits, because melancholy bloud is by it diminished, cureth deafnesse, reduceth the lost voice, augmenteth the powers and vertues of all the bodie, by rea∣son that it is by this meanes rid of superfluities. In the same sort also is anger delayed by it, because that choler or gall is by Phlebotomie also diminished. The aboundance of bloud is knowne no lesse by the thicknesse and troubled consistence of vrine, than by the signes before mentioned. Secondly, although the bloud be not inflamed, but onely superabounding, yet doth it cause greeuous agues and other perillous diseases: wherefore, whensoeuer we find an inflamma∣tion and an aboundance of bloud, presently we open a veine. Also if any one euery morning about the dawning of the day doth vse commonly to sweate, it is a signe of a superfluitie in the veines. Thirdly, where bad and cold bloud is, there must a purgation precéede phlebotomie; other∣wise the good bloud will be drawne foorth, and the thicke, tough and cold bloud remaine in the veines. Lastly, it is profitable at sometimes to be let bloud, not for any of the aforesaid causes, but only that the bloud might be led or drawne from the one veine into the other. For example, If a woman do ouerpasse the time wherein she should haue her flowers, then do we open the veine Saphea in the foote, thereby intending to draw the bloud downewards. Others comprehend all these particulars in these two points, namely, such ought to be phlebotomized that abound in bloud and for that cause are very subiect vnto sicknesse. Secondly, that are full of bad humors, or that do abound in a corrupted masse of bloud, and are diseased: of all which points, and how euery veine shall be opened, we will more at large speake hereafter, where we shall treate of euery sicknesse in particular.
Of the causes that prohibite or forbid phlebotomie. §. 2. WE haue before shewed what persons ought to be phlebotomized:Causes that hinder phle∣botomie. also what pro∣fite this letting of blood causeth. Now we will declare what persons must for beare it, and what might hinder it. First, Galen commandeth that no body before the foureteenth yeare of his age should be let blood: but his successors the latter Phisitions, will that no man should haue a veine opened before the seuenteenth yeare: also those that are aboue thréescore and ten yeares old should in no case meddle with it: adding, that youth being hote and moist, doth consume much, and therefore née∣deth much bloud for the sustenance of life. In like sort also haue old men small store of good blood, but rather great store of bad humors; where the letting of blood might take away the best blood and leaue the worst behind: Beside this, they are weake, and their strength doth dayly decay. But those that are of a middle age from thirtie to fiftie, may most safely vse phlebotomie: for that they neither incline to the one, nor to the other. To those that are cold of complexion is phlebotomie forbidden, as also to such as dwell in cold countries: for their blood lieth déepe in their bodies, is chicke, and vnapt to be educed. Also where there is a great paine shall it be omitted, except it were in a hote ague: and there shall so much be drawne that the patient do swoune, to the intent the whole bodie thereby might be cooled, and the heate taken away. Also it is not good presently after a bath to be let blood, nor after the vse of Venery, nor after any long lasting sicknesse, vnlesse the patient do abound in vncleane blood: neither must any one that hath ouerladen his stomacke with meate or drinke, and as yet is vndigested, vse phlebo∣tomy. They that are constrained to much vomiting of choler in the stomacke, must also forbeare it, otherwise it will greatly weaken them. Lastly, no man shall after much bleeding at the nose, or much bléeding of the hemorrhoides or piles, or after great store of the flowers in women, be phlebotomized; for it will cast him downe and weaken him, because the blood is the treasure of life. At what time and in what signe a veine ought to be opened. §. 3. FOr the preseruation of health, it is best to be let blood in Aprill or in May,When phle∣botomie ought to be vsed. because at that time man doth most abound in blood, and it shall be done on the right side, either in the hand, arme, or foote: for in these moneths and in Sommer also increaseth choler, which procéedeth from the liuer and gall, that both lie on the right side. In haruest groweth melancholy blood, and then must the veine of the spléene be opened on the left side, and in winter also. In like sort it is ordained to be let blood for diseases of the heart in the spring, of the liuer in sommer, of the féete in haruest, and of the head in winter. And to the end it might more cléerely appeare at what speciall times phlebotomie may be vsed, it shall now be shewed from moneth to moneth, which times are most conuenient, and which are not. In Ianuary shalt thou by no meanes be let blood, except necessitie constraine thée,Ianuarie. and that in diseases of the head. In February, if necessitie require, mayest thou vse it.Februarie. In March it is altogether forbidden.March. In Aprill it is alwayes conuenient to open a veine, but not the median.Aprill. In May it is very good and conuenient, but not in legs nor féete.May. In Iune (if néed require) thou mayest sometimes phlebotomize.Iune. In Iuly it is hurtfull, by reason of the heate.Iuly. In August likewise, vnlesse it be towards the latter end of the moneth.August. In September it is as conuenient as it was in Aprill or May.September.
October Noember.In October and Nouember mayest thou also phlebotomize. December.In December is phlebotomie prohibited, partly by reason of the extreme cold, partly also be∣cause at such time there is small store of blood in the body of man. There is a great abuse among the common people committed, to looke for the signe in the Almanacke, and so where the Moone resteth. They make also great difference betwéene the height and lownesse, drith and moistnesse of the signes: also whether the Moone be new or full, increasing or decreasing, and diuers things more, which of some very superstitiously are obser∣ued. Furthermore, if the Moone be in Aries, then it is forbidden to let blood in the head veine and vnder the tongue. And if the Moone be in Taurus, it is thought vnmeet to open any veines in the necke, or to boxe or cup about the necke or shoulders. When the Moone is in Gemini, which rule the armes, and is supposed to be a hote and moist signe, the places gouerned are not to be touched. Cancer is cold and moist, where if the Moon be, neither the hand nor the left arme ought to be touched. Because Leo is hote and drie, no phlebotomie is permitted concerning the heart. Ʋirgo is thought to be a very bad signe, and to be cold and drie, and to rule the guttes: at which time ought neither phlebotomie nor any purgation to be vsed, but all kind of Phisicke to be a∣bandoned. But I take it to be a great deale more méet that euery Phisition examine well the estate and maner of the diseased patient, and to iudge wisely thereof: and first to féele the pulses, and seeke out the infallible signes of the infirmitie, before he runne vp to heauen to see the celestial signes: for in sharpe and very hote diseases there is no leisure to expect a good signe celestiall, but imme∣diatly to open a veine, and that so often reiterated as néed shall require. But in such like infir∣mitie must be the counsell of an expert Phisition be alwayes vsed: for if phlebotomy in the like extremities be not in time adhibited, life it selfe might oftentimes be indangered. An admonition to those that let others blood. §. 4. ALl those that let others blood, must take great heed they enter not too déepe with their launcet, for feare of pricking an artery or sinew, because they are placed very neare, vnderneath, and about the veines. And if a sinew be wounded or hurt, great danger is like to ensue, as Spasmus, great tumors and swellings, or other more grieuous accidents, and at the last a terrible and hard death or at the least a resolution or lamenesse of the whole member so grieued; for a woun∣ded sinew is counted incurable, as at another time and place at large shall be shewed. Also if an Artery be touched, then either gusheth forth that excellent blood of the heart, in which the soule of man resteth; or else Sinouia, which very hardly will be stinted, because rest and quietnesse in all consolidations and healings are required, where indéede all arteries are in continuall motion. But to stay the running of the Sinouia, thou shalt haue very good and expert remedies in the fift part of this booke. Notwithstanding it is sometime permitted to open an artery, but only when the greatest need requireth that may be, because (as is already said) it can by no meanes be done without great danger. But because there is no such peril in the opening of some veines as is in others, let this instruction that followeth he diligently obserued. Head veine ate Median som∣what dange∣rous. Liuer veine dangerous. The spleene veine.The Cephalicall or head veine is without danger, for that there is neither artery nor sinew neare it. The Median is somewhat perillous, for there lieth a sinew iust vnder it, which is to be re∣garded. Basilica or liuer veine is not without danger, for vnder it is placed both an artery and a sinew. The Spléene veine hath no other danger, but that it is small and hard to be pricked: and therefore shall the hand first be laid in warme water. But whatsoeuer is more to be said of these and the like other veines, shall immediatly hereafter be declared. Incision great or small.In this point all Phisitions do agrée, that wheresoeuer is great store and very thicke and grosse blood, there must the incision be made the larger, that the vapors and bad blood might the better issue forth: for if it be not large inough, then commeth forth the thinne and subtile blood, and that which is grosse and bad remaineth behind. But if the patients be very weake, then of
necessitie must the issue be made the lesse, that their little strength be not ouerthrowne, and their vitall spirits let out. What is to be done before, in, and after the letting of bloud. §. 5. WHensoeuer thou doest purpose to be let blood, vse some foure dayes before meats that are subtile, light and easie of digesture, especially if thy blood be grosse, thicke and heauy, that thereby it be made thinner, more flued and subtile, and so much the easier issue forth: neither is it amisse to bathe thy selfe two or thrée dayes before, but not on the day appointed for letting of blood. It is also good in the precedent dayes to vse the sirupes of vineger. Note also, that thou be not phlebotomised presently after awaking out of thy sléepe, but ra∣ther two or thrée houres after it, and when thou hast walked before. All the learned Phisitions also do counsell (although it be against the common custome) not to open any veine, the patient being fasting, or not hauing eaten a new laid egge, and drunke a good draught of wine vpon it; then to be let bloud, and thrée houres after to breake his fast againe: the cause whereof is, that when the stomacke hath taken a little food, nature is most strong. The member likewise which is to be phlebotomised, ought first to be somewhat chafed and rubbed with warme clothes, that the humors thereby might be drawne thither. It is also not amisse to bind the member with a band: for that in like sort draweth the humors into the veines. It befalleth oft in phlebotomie, that the blood by no meanes can be stenched or stopped: for the which thou shalt find in the fift booke diuers approued remedies; but for the same is the powder of calcined or burned Vitrioll very highly commended, being cast vpon it. If the patient chance to faint in the letting of blood, let him drinke a cup of good wine, for that reuiueth the vital spirits, strengtheneth the heart, and refresheth the blood. Vse also for the same those things that do comfort the heart, which thou shalt find in the second booke. If the opened veine should swell and puffe vp, then boyle Rue in the oyle of Oliues, and ap∣ply it to the veine. This also is very good to be vsed after cupping, if the place should begin to rankle. After the letting of bloud the patient shall forbeare sléepe at the least sixe houres, and not eate in the time aboue specified, that the homors now stirred and troubled in the body might be set∣led againe in the meane while. Afterwards let him vse light meates, abstaine from milke or any thing that is made thereof, and then at the last commit himselfe to sléepe. Lastly, he is not to vse any thing either inwardly or outwardly, but that might warme and comfort the body, and to follow that most learned man Ioachimus Camerarius, who excellently and briefly obserued these rules after the letting of bloud. Prima coena die sit misso sanguine parca: Lux abeat laetis aucta secunda modis. Tertia sed placidae debetur tota quieti: Quarta & quinta sibi mollius esse volunt. Balnea sexta petit: mox septima colligit auras, Fert{que} vagos circum rura nemus{que} pedes. Octaua amplexus dilectae coniugis: & quae Antè fuit, vitam restituisse solet: That is, The first day not much meate be spent: The second day to mirth be bent: The third day vse thy rest and ease: The fourth and fift eate what thou please: The sixt day bathe in any case: The seuenth walke from place to place: The eight mayest thou lie with thy wife, and after liue thy wonted life.
What veines ought in euery disease to be opened. §. 6. SEeing that the body of man is euery where full of veines, here shall now be shewed which of them ought to be opened for the ease of any one member, or for cure and helpe of any disease whatsoeuer. First therefore shall be noted, that phlebotomie may be vsed in diuers parts of the bodie, partly as the disease re∣quireth, partly also according as the veines are apparent. Amongst others, there are six from the armepit downeward to the elbow, with those on the hand, that may be opened. The first is called Cephalica, the head veine: the second Basilica, in Latin Hepatica, the liuer veine: the third Mediana, Cordiaca, Corporalis, Nigra, Matrix and Communis, that is, the median, heart, corpulent, blacke, mother and common veine. The fourth Axillaris, the veine of the armepit, because in the armepit it most plainely appeareth. The fift on the beginning of the hand, which now is no longer phlebotomised. The sixt is also on the outside of the hand, be∣tweene the litle and the fourth finger, which of the Phisitions is called Sceiles, Splenetica, Salua∣tella, that is, the spleene veine. The lower parts of the body (as the legs and féet) haue thrée speciall veines: the one Ischiadi∣ca, the hip veine: the other is Saphea or Saphena, the wombe veine: the third Poplitis, the knée vein, which is the iust middle veine. They are the special veines that commonly are opened: of which and others more, we will hereafter speake at large. Of the head veine Cephalica. §. 7. THis veine is also called Humeralis the shoulder veine, because it easeth all the veins that are aboue and beneath the necke, whensoeuer it is opened. This veine being opened, it doth much helpe the head-ach called Hemicrana, madnesse, and such like, that proceed of an extraordinary heat. It beginneth to appéere about the armpits, and passeth along by the left arme. To the end then that the Reader might more cléerely vnderstand and know, in what infir∣mities this veine may conueniently be opened, I wil briefly rehearse out of other places of this our booke, and shew when it is vsually opened: As for example; in head-aches with agues, heate and flures: in tumors of the armepits: in the paines, inflammations and apostumations, with other impediments of the eyes: in frensies or madnesse, in the night mare or hag: in al accidents of the mouth and throte: in all rheumes, in hot agues with an infection of the lungs. Here maist thou perceiue and sée manifestly, that this may iustly be called the head veine. Of the liuer veine Basilica. §. 8. AMongst all others is this liuer veine Basilica the principallest, whose name is sufficiently knowne both in Gréeke and English. This being opened, vn∣burdeneth all the parts below the necke, as breast, liuer, &c. of their superfluous bloud; so that if any of these be any kind of way diseased, it may by that meanes be recouered againe: it taketh her beginning of the armepit veine or Axillaris, and goeth downe to the elbow. The diseases in the which it is v∣sually phlebotomised, are these: In tumors of the eyes, in vnmeasurable bléeding at the nose, in whéesing or ringing of the eares, in extreme melancholy, in rheumes with heate and agues, and in all infirmities of the lungs, in broken veines or varices of the brest, in the panting or beating of the heart, in great faintnesse, in ruptures, in bleeding of the hemorrhoides, in barrennesse of women that procéedeth of heate, in an obdurated and hardned liuer, in melancholy, in hot swel∣lings of the stomacke, in obstructions of the vrine, in impostumes of the wombe, in the paine of the hips, in the gout, in wrenchings of the ioynts, in broken veines, in great inflammations, in the poxe, and in the measles.
Of the Median or middle veine. §. 9. THis is for the most part of all our Phisitions and Chirurgians called by the La∣tine name Mediana: because it lieth betwéene the abouesaid veines, and taketh his beginning also from them both. This being opened in all infirmities doth most good, for that it easeth both the vpper and the lower parts of the bodie; for which cause it is called Vniuersalis, the common veine, and not as some suppose, because it commeth from the heart. Here is to be obserued, that if the head veine or Cephalica should be opened, and it no where appeareth; in stead of it the Median shall rather be vsed than the Liuer veine: likewise if the Liuer veine be not seene, open rather the Median than the head veine. As for example, this veine is conueniently opened in swolne eyes, bleeding at the nose, outragious melancholy, hot rheumes, panting of the hart, ruptures, to procure chil∣dren in women of hote complexions, bléeding of the hemorrhoides or piles, and to procure the flowers in women, &c. by which euery skilfull man may guide himselfe. Of the armepit veine Axillaris. §. 10. THe fourth veine is called (as is aforesaid) Axillaris: it is a branch of the great liuer veine, called Vena caua, the hollow veine, which commeth from thence into the armes, and shew∣eth it selfe in the bending of the arme. It hath great correspondence with the head veine, as is already sufficiently shewed. After the same sort it is with the fift, which is on the end of the arme: so that all that hath bin said before, and which shall be said hereafter of the Spleene veine, the very same may be said of these two. Of the Spleene veine or Saluatella. §. 11. THe sixt principall veine lieth betwéene the little and fourth fingers, on the outside of both hands. It is oftentimes opened, because it cleanseth the spleene, liuer and brest, cléereth the voice, preserueth the internall parts, but especially the stomacke and mouth from all accidents whatsoeuer; easeth the paine of the heart, and taketh away all the superfluous bloud of the before named inward parts. The later Phi∣sitions make this distinction: they call this veine on the left hand Splenetica, the spléene veine; and on the right hand Saluatella: for this cause haue diuers opened that on the left side, letting it bléede till of it selfe it stanched, supposing thereby to heale all infirmities of the spleene. It is also opened in blood spittings, in obstructions of the spleene, and in the French pox. That on the right hand in infirmities of the liuer, in shaking palsies, in contractures of the mouth, in all maner of stitches, in the gout, in the pockes, and in fine, almost in all other diseases. Of the hip veine. §. 12. AFter the description of the veines that are in the armes and hands, it followeth now to treate of the three principall veines apparent in the legs and feet. The first and vp∣permost of them is called in Gréeke Ischiadica, and in English the hip veine. It is com∣monly opened vpon the left foote, thereby to draw the blood downewards, and to ease all the maladies of the same side, of the kidneyes, of the wombe, and such like: also to make the piles bléed, to helpe the paine of the hip, to cease the raging of the gout, if it be opened hard by the little toe, although it specially appeere vpon the ankle on the outside of the leg. Of the wombe veine or Saphena. §. 13. THis commeth from the great liuer or hollow veine, and descendeth from the foreside of the legge downe to the inward ankle, where it very manifestly appeareth: for the which cause it is also called Manifesta, the apparent or manifest veine, otherwise Saphea, and not Saphena. This is especially opened to draw the bloud downewards from the priuie parts of man, from the wombe in women, in sore eyes, in madnesse, in the palsie, in the night mare,
falling euill, blood spittings, womens flowers, and barrennesse of them, in the suffocation of the matrix, or the rising vp of the wombe or mother, in the gout, and in the plague. Of the hamme or knee veine. §. 14. THis also is a median or middle veine, which descendeth downewards through the calfe of the leg into the foote, as the median of the arme doth into the hand: and it is more méet to be opened to the aforesaid infirmities, than either the hip or wombe veine, because it is néerer adiacent to the womb with her annexed parts than either of them, and therefore draweth with more force. Of the veine in the forehead. §. 15. IN the middest of the forehead is also a very apparent veine, which vsually was opened in all paines of the hinder part of the head and necke, although it haue continued very long; also in all paines of the eyes, but first of all ought the head veine to be opened. It is also vsed in the frensie, night mare, and palsie. Of the veines of the eyes. §. 16. THese litle veines appéere in the corners of the eyes, hard by the nose vpwards toward the forehead. They are commonly opened in inflammations of the eyes: but first of all open the veine of the head. Of the veine in the temples of the head. §. 17. IN the temples of the head are veines, which some men do counsell to be ope∣ned in the paine of the eyes, if the same procéed of hot humors or windinesse, as is before said. But it is not without great daunger, because there is an artery hard by it, which easily may be felt. The same may be said of the veines behind the eares, which also are very commodiously opened in great paines of the head, as Hemicrania, in a continuall paine and swimming in the head. But Auicenna supposeth, that such as vse it thereby are made barren or vnfruitfull. Of the veine vpon the nose. §. 18. IN like manner also is there a veine vpon the nose close by the forehead, which may be ope∣ned: but first must a towell or napkin be tied hard about the necke and throte, that the veine may swell or puffe vp, and be the better séene. Of the veines in the lippes. §. 19. THese are opened in all putrifactions and rottings of the gums, and many other infections of the mouth, but not before the head veine. Of the veines of the almonds or kernels in the throate. §. 20. THere be foure of these veines apparent, the which being opened, helpe very greatly in all rheumes and defluxions, as also in the tooth-ach, but it is not good to open them but when the rheume beginneth to fall. Of the veines vnder the tongue. §. 21. VNder the tongue are also some veines, which in dangerous diseases may well be opened, and especially in the squinancy, and in all other flegmaticall tumors of the throte, in the night mare, and all maladies of the tongue.
Of the veines of the necke. §. 22. TO conclude, there be certaine veines in the necke, called of the Arabians Guingedes, which vsually were opened in the beginning of the leprie, in the paine of the throate called An∣gina, in shortnes and oppression of the breath, impostumes of the lungs, in affections of the spléene and sides. Thus ending this Chapter of the opening of all kind of veines, we wil treate of boxing or cupping, which also is greatly commended in Phisicke. The ninth Chapter. Of Cupping. THis is the second meanes, whereby the abundance of blood in mans body is diminished. Galen did so highly estéeme of it, that he termeth it a preci∣ous helpe, and commendeth it in many diseases, but especially where flegme and windinesse doth excéed. He ascribeth vnto it the attraction of humors, ceasing of paine, diminishing of flegme, dissipation of windines, to prouoke hunger, to withdraw and to stay rheumes, and to stanch blee∣ding. He aduiseth also to vse it in a great paine of the belly procéeding of wind, as the most true and present remedie, namely, to fasten a great box or cup on the place pained, and often to renew it: for thereby is the wind maruellously drawne forth and dissipated: and not only for this, but for the hardnes and other accidents of the spleene, but without picking or opening of the skin. But note that this boxing or cupping ought not to be vsed, except the patient haue first of all throughly bene purged: otherwise it doth draw the superfluous humiditie, which lieth deepe vnderneath, outward to the skin. These boxes also are not to be set iust vpon the place affected, but hard by it thereabout, that by them the matter might be dissipated and withdrawne: As for example, if a woman had too many of her flowers continuing, the cups or boxes shall be set vpon her brests. In too much bléeding at the nose, vpon the nauell, and so in more places contrary still to the course of the blood, or else vpon the veines whence the cause procéedeth: likewise to prouoke or moue the termes in women, the cups shall be fixed vpon the thighes: in sore eyes, behind the necke, as in many places in this booke shall be shewed. Thus much for the cupping without opening the skin.. But if thou wilt open the skinne also, as commonly is vsed in diuers parts of the bodie, and especially in any hard tumor or Schyrrhus, or other swellings with a great distention and paine. In like manner when thou wilt draw the peccant matter from the infected place to another, as to remoue head-ach, the cups are fixed on the caues of the legs with opening of the skin: which also is done if the termes or flowers in women be stayed, and in such like other accidents, as hereafter in this booke at large shall appeare. The tenth Chapter. Of the diminishing of the bloud by Horsleaches. THe third meanes whereby the blood is drawne forth of the body, is that blood sucking water worme, which the auncient Phisitions by their ex∣perience for the helpe of man haue found out. These Horsleaches are of diuers and sundrie colours, some blacke, some red some gréenish, and of many other colous. They are all of them somewhat venemous, but es∣pecially those that be partie coloured with greene stripes, big, and liue in stinking pooles, which altogether are to be auoided. Others that ap∣peare in May, and most of all about noone, abide in other pooles and wa∣ters where also they are taken: how to prepare them for to vse, hath bene shewed in the sixt Chapter. Before they be fastened, the place must first be well chafed, with water moistened, and well scratched with the nailes; then take they the better hold. When they are fast, annoint the place
with warme oyle that it coole not: and if they be fixed to either hands or féete, then put that part into luke-warme water, whereon they be fastened: but if they draw or sucke not strong inough, c off a litle peece of their tailes, that the bloud may passe through them; for they will not leaue sucking for all that, vnlesse a little salt or a few ashes be cast vpon their heads, or that they be stricken on the head with a little wand or rod, or that they be burnt with a waxe candle. After they be falne off, thou shalt fasten a boxe or cup vpon the same place to draw out the remaining bloud and venome, or else moisten it with a warme sponge: and if it continue bléeding, cast some meale on it, and lay shéepes wooll dipped in oile vpon that, or some other thing; as in the fift part of this booke is taught how to stanch blood. Here is also to be obserued, that these horsléeches do not draw the blood out of the inward parts of the bodie, but onely that which lieth in the flesh thereabout, so that they can onely be vsed in place of boxes, and especially in blacke melancholy blood, which by nature they only suck forth. And this is all the difference betwéene the vse of them and of cups. In the application or fastening of Horsleaches, they must be put into a quill, réede or cane, that they take hold of no other place but where they should. It is furthermore well knowne, that great store of superfluous humidities are expelled by baths, sweat, rubbing, vomiting, and such like: but because these things must be altered, aug∣mented and diminished according to the estate of the person, great héede ought to be giuen, what here and there in this booke is spoken of them. The eleuenth Chapter. Of the sixe things not naturall, called of the Phisitions Res non naturales. THe cause why we make no mention of these sixe things, is, for that by them a generall rule of the life is to be obserued, but most of all in the time of sicknesse, when euery one (according as necessitie requireth) is taught what order is to be kept in euery of them. The first is aire, to wit, what aire ought to be elected, what to be re∣fused, and if neither of these may be, by what meanes to correct it. The second is mouing or motion, which is not a litle to be regarded, because some diseases require much mouing, others litle, and some none at all. The third is sléepe and watching, which is of no lesse account than motion. The fourth is fulnesse and emptinesse, which teacheth what order is to be followed in meate and drinke, as also in hunger and abstinence: the meanes also to restore that which either is wanting in the one or in the other. The fift, the accidents or motions of the mind, as anger, feare, gladnesse, sorrow, loue, hatred, &c. which oftentimes cause great chaunge and alteration both in sicknesse and in health. The sixt is meate and drinke; which is méete for euery disease, which vnméete. Of the which in euery particular disease, seuerall instructions shall be giuen: this generall rule presupposed, that no man diseased shall ouerlade his stomacke with meate or drinke, except it were to vomit it vp againe. It is also better to eate thrice a day, and a little at once, than but twise aboun∣dantly. If of all these things thou wilt haue a more iust explication, looke in the second part of the wheesing and stopping of the breath, by the which thou mayest also rule thy selfe in other infir∣mities. Furthermore, whatsoeuer might be said of the foure complexions or humors of mans body, as bloud, choler, flegme and melancholy, with their incompassed mixtures called Intemperies, which are eight fold, and what else doth appertaine vnto them, shall sufficiently as oportunitie serueth hereafter be declared.
The twelfth Chapter. An explication of all the weights and measures which commonly are vsed in Phisicke. THere be two sorts of pounds: the common pound containeth sixtéene ounces, but the phisicall pound hath but twelue ounces. It is abbreui∣ated thus, lib. but to auoide all errours, we haue set downe the word pound: and where a phisicall pound was meant, there are twelue oun∣ces specified. An ounce containeth eight dragmes, which euery where is noted by the name ounce. Halfe an ounce is foure dragmes, which is noted by the Phisitions and Apothecaries with this marke ℥. ss. which might bréede errour, and therefore do we set the name of halfe an ounce. Dragma is the eight part of an ounce, which we write thus, dragme or drag. least by the cha∣racter some error might be committed. Scrupulus is the third part of a dragme, and shall be written after this manner, scruple or scrup. Granum a graine, is the weight of a barley corne, whereof twentie do make one scruple: but because that barley cornes are bigger in one country than in another, thou shalt in steed of them vse pepper cornes, and so take twentie of them for a scruple: This shall be noted by the name graine. Manipulus is a handfull of herbes, flowers or séedes, and this shall be marked thus with an M. and halfe an handfull, which is called of the Apothecaries Pugillus, shall be noted thus, halfe M. Measures of water, honie and such like liquors, do we estéeme euery wine-pint at eightéene ounces. Note also, that if thou happen to find any vnknowne name or word in this booke, either in Latine or English, that thou shalt find it in the Table or Index at the end. After all the instructions we wil by Gods grace come to the principall, and beginning at the vppermost part of the body, that is the head, descend downeward to the foote. The most high Phisition God our most deere father, through Iesus Christ our onely Sauior, giue vs his blessing and grace to finish it. The end of the Introduction.
The first part of this Booke containeth the Head, with all the parts thereof, to the very necke, as Face, Haire, Beard, Scull, Braine, Nose, Eares, Lippes, Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, Speech, &c. with all such accidents as are incident vnto them, and their appropriate remedies. The first Chapter. Of paine in the Head. THere are many paines of the head, by the Arabians commonly called Soda: which as they procéede of diuers causes, so do they also differ in nature. They are deliuered vnto vs either in particular, proper, principall or vniuersall affections, vnder which all the other are comprehended, as Cephalalgia, Cephalaea, Hemicrania, and Congelation. Of giddinesse of the head, falling euill, dead palsie, and such like infirmities shal be spoken hereafter, where we intreate of the braine: for that these and diuers other diseases are caused for the most part of a debilitie and weaknesse of the braine. Of all outward accidents, as blowes, bruises, wounds, and falles on the head, shal be shewed in the Chapter of the braine-pan or scull. Cephalalgia.Cephalalgia, by the Gréekes so termed, is such a disease that almost affecteth the whole head: which sometimes is very violent, otherwhiles more tolerable, and either continueth long, or passeth ouer spéedily. Cephalaea.Cephalaea is an intolerable headach, which (notwithstanding that it hath some communion with the aforenamed Cephalalgia) doth maruellously weaken all the powers of the head, and at sometime ceaseth, séeming as though it would not returne againe, yet (in maner like vnto the falling sicknesse) by fits returneth with such violence, such noise in the eares, such beating in the forehead, such thrusting forth of the eyes, and finally with such swelling vp of all the veines of the head, that both hearing and sight thereby decayeth: yea taketh diuers with that extremity, that it séemeth vnto them as if something did beate on the inside of their head with a hammer, and would rend and teare their head asunder. This ach sometimes commeth in the sinewes of the eyes, and doth opilate and harme them greatly, and at the length induceth blindnes altoge∣ther. And albeit this affection of the head oft times groweth of a light and small cause, yet pro∣cureth it diuers times very heauy and grieuous accidents. HemicraniaHemicrania is also an head ach, wherewith either the right or the left side, the backe or fore∣part of the head is infected: it taketh commonly the one side of the head, euen from the midst of the forehead, & so passeth through the boll or concauity of the scull to the very back part of the head. It doth also very often so disease the eyes, that it perisheth the sight of them: insomuch that this paine is so like to the aboue named Cephalaea, that Galen and many others do not onely de∣scribe them both together, but vse also one and the selfesame remedies for them both, as hereaf∣ter may appeare. Congelatio.The fourth kind of head-ach is Congelatio, as it were a cold nummednesse: this procéeding from the backe part of the head taketh away all sense and féeling of the patient, and therefore it is not vnlike vnto that heauy and drowsie disease Lethargus and Stupr, wherein also the affe∣cted body is suddenly depriued both of sense and feeling.
Of the causes of head-ach. §. 1. THe common causes of head-ach in generall are innumerable; as heate of the Sunne, bathings, chaunge of ayre, a continuall South wind, a strong sent of spices, whether they be hote or cold by nature: also the smell of wine, drun∣kennesse, stinking meate, garlicke, onions, mustard, strokes or blowes, brui∣sings or great motions of the braine, sleepe presently after dinner, much blee∣ding, wormes in the eares, nostrels, or stomacke, choler in the stomacke, fumes and vapours out of the same, too much repletion of the stomacke, Intemperies or an vnnaturall mixture of the humors, with many more, which for breuities sake we omit, and will treate of more necessary matters. But for the most part (as hath already béene sayd) this paine in the head procéedeth of the intemperature of the foure humors, namely of bloud, choler, flegme and melancholy. The Phisitions haue found out eight kinds of this intemperature, with their appropriate and due remedies, as hereafter at large shall be shewed. As concerning the aches and paines of the head, we do diuide them into hote or cold aches, in which all others that we purpose to treate of are comprehended, and so beginne with the hote paines of the head. The signes of a hote head-ach that proceedeth from choler. §. 2. IN this kind of head-ach are these common signes, belching or breaking of wind vpward with lothsomnesse and thirst, dryth of the mouth, tongue and nostrels. The paine is pricking, sharpe, and rather in the right than in the left side of the head, heate ouer all the body, but especially in the nostrels, no appe∣tite, no sleepe, the pulses hastie and quicke, the vrine reddish, the face yellow. The surest notes are, if the time of the yéere be hote and drie, the patient yong, and hath vsed those things that procure heate and dryth. The causes and signes then being knowne, now follow the first and especiallest meanes to ease it, namely in shunning those things that in any way might either procure or continue it, as hot wines, the sent of hot and strong things, the vse of meates hot in operation: then to beginne (not onely in this, but in all other infirmities whatsoeuer) with the easiest remedies at the first, and most of all if this hote paine of the head be but new and of no continuance: at which time, to delay the heate, thou mayest safely vse these things that follow. Applications, Ointments, Plaisters, Lotions. OXyrrhodinum applied outwardly is greatly commended, that is, oyle of roses, water and vineger of roses, of each a like quantitie: in this mixture dippe double linnen clothes, and lay them so cold and wet to the forehead, from one temple to another, and as often as it drieth must it be refreshed againe. Others make it stronger thus: Take of Rose water fiue ounces, of Melilot water foure ounces, water of Nightshade two ounces, oile of Roses one ounce and a halfe, Rose vineger one ounce, vse it as the other before. These two compositions, by reason of the Oyle and vineger of Roses which are in them, are called Oxyrrhodina: vnto which (if the heate be very extreame) thou mayest adde one dragme of Camfere. Also take the white of an egge well beaten, Rose water one ounce, water of Elder, and Fennell water, of each halfe an ounce, fiue small Nuts well beaten in a mortar, a little Saffron; lay this to the forehead with wooll. Another that is more stronger, the water of the white water-Lilly, water of Endiue, of each three ounces, red, white, and yellow Saunders, or one of them, of each one dragme, beaten Rose leaues halfe a dragme, beaten Camfere halfe a dragme, mixe them all together, and vse them as is aboue shewed. This cooleth greatly, and easeth the paine of the head.
The ointment of Roses described by Mesues. TAke fresh or new hogges grease, as much as thou wilt; wash it very often with warme water, afterwards with cold water: then take as many Roses in weight as thy grease weigheth, beate them both together in a morter, let them so rest the space of seuen dayes: then straine it through a cloth, and beate as many Ro∣ses with thy grease as before, and so let them stand other seauen dayes; straine them againe, and adde to thy grease halfe the weight of the iuice of Roses, and the sixt part of the oyle of swéete Almonds, and boile them together vntill all the iuice be consu∣med, which thou shalt know thus: put one or two droppes of it into the fire, where if it make no noise or hissing like vnto water, then it is sufficiently boiled: then take it from the fire, stir∣ring it continually with a woodden pestell vntill it waxeth stiffe and white: some adde a little Opium vnto it to make it coole the more, but it is néedlesse; for if it be necessary, thou mayest adde it at all times afterward. This ointment is an especiall good remedie in Cephalalgia and heate of the head, it stayeth flegmaticall rheumes and flegmons, it mitigateth the canker, it is also good for the heate of the stomacke, liuer, kidneyes, &c. A cooling vnguent, Infrigidans Galeni. TAke two ounces of white or virgine waxe, melt it easily, and wash it often with faire water, and at the last with white vineger: then adde vnto it foure ounces of the oyle of Roses, which also hath bene washed as before. It may also be made vp in forme of a plaister or Ceratum. It easeth both the heate of agues & of the head, being applied to the forehead and temples: it is also very good against the paine of the kidneys. If thou wilt vse it for the paine of the head, melt it on a litle fire, then wash it with vineger, and with the iuice of Plantaine & Nightshade, annoint the forehead with it, especially on those seames of the scull: then lay vine or willow leaues vpon it, & thou shalt find great ease. To the same intent is the Poplar vnguent or Vnguentum Populeum also vsed, which is found rea∣die made in all Apothecaries shops. Likewise take Rose leaues, Willow leaues, water Lillies, Mallowes, of each one handfull, boyle them in water, and irrigate thy head with it. Also take Violets, Barley beaten in a morter, beaten Gourd séeds or the barke of Gourds, Poppy heads, seedes of Hollihocke, Purslaine seedes, Lettice seedes, of each one handfull: boile them in water, and let the decoction being warme drop from on high vpon thy head. Note also that if necessitie and the violent paine should require stronger remedies, then vse the iuice of such herbes as are cold and drie, as of Plantaine, of Shepheards purse, of Nightshade, of Housleeke, of Pome∣granates, and in the greatest extremitie adde a little Opium vnto it, of Henbane: adding the iuice of Southernewood or of poppie vnto it, and applying them to the head as is aboue sayd. Here is also to be obserued, that these stupefactiue or narcolicall things are not to be vsed, but onely in the greatest extremities. Neither may any such cold remedies be adhibited to the back-part of the head, but only to the forehead. In fine, wheresoeuer these & such like may be omitted, there are they not at al to be vsed: notwithstanding if the extremitie be such that no other reme∣dies would serue the turne, & any danger might ensue of any obstupefaction or numming of any one part, this shall be sometimes vsed: Take the wood of Cassia small beaten one dragme, mixe it with oyle, and drop it into the eares and nostrels: and if peraduenture the patient should loose both sense and féeling, then mixe halfe a dragme of Beuer Cod, a scruple of Saffron, and a little oile of Oliues, or rather oile of Chestnuts together. Also make this emplaister: Take of the Vine buds, beate them small, and adde as much oile of Roses and Barley flower as shall suffice, then lay it plaisterwise to the forehead: in the want of Vine buds take Housléeke, or the iuice of Nightshade, of Shepheards purse, or of Let∣tice. Or else take yellow Saunders, Roses, water Lillies, of each halfe an ounce, Camfere one scruple, Spica of India halfe one scruple: wet them together with Rose water, boyle them, and receiue the vapours at your nose through a funnell: likewise take Roses, the blossomes of the Pomegranate trée, shels of Pomegranates, séeds or berries of the Mirtle trée, shels of Citrones, of each one dragme, Agarick as much; boile them in lie a little while, and wash the head with it.
This cooleth, drieth and strengtheneth the braines. Otherwise take Venice hard or cake Sope, slice it smal into a flat earthen pan, powre a good strong ley vpon it, couer it with a linnen cloth, and set it in the warme sunne while the Sope be molten: stir it oftentimes til the ley be euapo∣rated or dried away, then put Rose water vpon it, and let it drie againe: this reiterate so often till the Sope haue lost her strong and vnsauorie smell, and imbibe the swéete smell of the Rose water. Take of this prepared Sope one pound, white or yellow Saunders, Roses, of each halfe one ounce, water Lillies two dragmes, Camfere one dragme, being all beaten to powder mixe them with the Sope, and make it vp in little cakes, drie them, and reserue them for thy vse. Of the paine in the head with agues, and laske or flixe of the bellie. §. 3. WHereas this paine of the head is oftentimes cause of diuers other mala∣dies, it shall not be amisse to describe that headache which raigned in the yeare of our Lord 1564 in Mosbach, and in the whole Dukedome of the Palsgraue of Rhene: at which time I compiled this present worke. This paine began with a shiuering cold, presently ensued an ague with a little heate, but with great drithe and thirst, which continued about one fortnight or more. It returned vnto diuers after they had bin cleare of it a moneth or twaine, and that twise or thrise togither: others were intolerably troubled in the head, and some so vehemently vexed with a flixe of the bellie without bloud, that it could by no meanes by stayed, yea they oftentimes very miserably peri∣shed with it. In this headach were these remedies found very effectuall and good. First, if nothing do dis∣swade from it, thou shalt open the head veine, especially if the patient be yong, full of bloud, and be of body strong and able inough to beare it. Children shall then purge with easie medicines, as Cassia, Manna, sirupe of Roses, Sene leaues decocted with some cooling herbes. The bigger sort shall be purged with sharpe pils and other purgations, if they haue no laske withall: and if nothing else could be had out of hand, thou shalt make this decoction or drinke: Take Sena leaues one ounce, Cinnamom, Annise and Fennell seedes, Currans, of each as much as thou canst hold betwéene two of thy fingers, Licorise the length of thy finger, if it be a thicke sticke take lesse of it, one fig, both cut small, swéete Marioram, Rosemarie, as much as thou canst take vp betwéene thy fingers, Sugar one ounce: boyle them all in a quart of water, till halfe be con∣sumed: of this giue to a child to drinke two ounces, to an old body fower ounces, to a strong body mayest thou boyle half an ounce of Sene leaues with it. For women & childrē to be boxed on the sholders and legs is very good, or to rub their arms and legs with warme clothes down∣wards. It is also good for them to bathe their féete in the decoction of Cummomill, Roses and Betonie. Wines of all sorts must be shunned in this infirmitie, and all things that are hot, as Spices, Onions, Garlicke and such like: for daily drinke take two handfuls of Barly, Anni∣séedes halfe an ounce, Raisins one ounce and a halfe: boile these together in a pottle of water, till the Barly do burst: then adde thrée dragmes of Cinnamom grossely beaten, and let it boile a little, & so coole. Séeing then this sicknesse prouoketh thirst, thou maiest not altogether bar the diseased from any kind of drinke, but let him take inough of the prescribed decoction, with the si∣rupe of Roses, of Violets or of Citrones admixed. Thou mayest also giue him ye conserue of the same flowers, with the water of Endiue, Succorie, Borage, and of Lettice, for that it doth com∣fort the heart. For his meate he shall commonly vse French Barly boiled with a hen in broth, veale, kids flesh, or stewed Prunes, and such like light meates. But if a flixe or loosenesse in the bodie be adioyned to the former infirmitie, the affected partie shall in any wise take great héede of such light and loosing meates: and onely vse rosted veale, pullets rosted, and other small birds, stewed Quinces, or any such like thing. Or if he would haue any other meate dressed, it shal be done with stilled water, which is made as followeth: Take as much faire water as thou wilt, set it on the fire, and cast a good péece of steele into it, being first made red hot thrée or foure times together: then let the water coole, and vse it as thou wilt. In like sort also mayest thou prepare water of iron, of gold, of siluer, and of flints for the same purpose: thus is wine, the milke of a cow and of goates also stéeled.
But to come to our purpose again: as long as this loosenesse of the bodie doth continue, thou shalt annoynt the stomacke twise a day with the oyles of Mastix and of Quinces. If it be about the time of the yeare that Sloes be ripe, take as many of them as you please, put them into a pot, and powre boyling water vpon them; stop or couer them very close: giue vnto the infirmed bodie three or foure of these a litle before his meate: noting alwaies, that in foure and twenty howers he vse not aboue twenty of them at the most. Contrariwise, if the bodie be bound, thou shalt seeke by all meanes thou maist, to loose it: o∣therwise many vapors ascend vp into the head, and there augment both the heate and the paine, yea oftentimes bereaue the patient of his wittes. Wherfore first of all thou shalt trie to open the bodie by suppositories, which if they will not suffice, vse common Clisters, which her∣after in the third part for the binding & stopping of the bodie are prescribed. Otherwise, if these do not please thee, vse some cooling purgation, or else that purging potion aboue described. There be aboue set downe many vnguents, salues, and waters, but all are very good for the paine of the head. But in this kind of head-ach, this remedie that followeth is expresly described: Take of the water of Lettice, Nightshade, and of Housleeke, of each two ounces, water of Ca∣momill an ounce and a halfe, good strong vineger one ounce, Camfere beaten foure graines: mixe them all together, or take Rose water, Rose vineger, Melilot water, Betonie water, of each, or of as many as are to be had, what quantitie thou please, wet linnen clothes in them, and lay them to the forehead. In this infirmitie oftentimes is both the toung and throate very raw and sore, by reason of the great heate; for the which looke the remedies that are set downe in the Chap. 13. §. 6. of this first part, for the infirmities and heate of the toung: and the gargarismes for the paine in the throte in the first Chapter of the second part. The sirupe of Mulberies with Plantaine, Knotgrasse, and Selfeheale water admired, conduceth and helpeth very much: likewise, take the seede of Quinces, and the seede of Flea∣woort: then take a litle sticke, and tie to the end of it a little skarlet or linnen cloth with one dragme of these seedes in it, steepe it in the water of Selfeheale: when thou wilt cleanse thy toung, rub it easily with that cloth so steeped: it cleanseth, moisteneth, cooleth and healeth all the chops or clifts in it. To comfort the heart, vse Manus Christi, with Pearles, conserue of water Lillies, Pome∣granates preserued Citrons, and others such like. This binding water hath done very many much good: Take a hote wheaten loafe new ta∣ken out of the ouen, take out all the crum of it, put a good quantitie of stéeled water vnto it, with one ounce and a halfe of Nutmegs, stop it close, and let it so stand one whole day in a warme place: then still of the water in a glasse Lembecke: giue of this to the patient euery morning two ounces, and let him fast two hours after it: two hours after his meate, giue him as much more, not forgetting first to warme it alwaies, and let him then fast till night. The third po∣tion or draught he shall take the next morning fasting (as before) after the same: this is not on∣ly in this kind of flixe, but in all other flixes experimented and approued. Note also, that if the flixe be without heate, thou maist take red wine in stead of the water: for then will it be of bet∣ter force and vertue. Heate of the head with melancholie. §. 4. THis infirmitie is described by these signes following: the paine is not so great as the former, but with a drinesse and sadnesse: the heate is more euident in the left side of the face than in the right, it causeth disquietnesse, and albeit the sicke sometimes taketh rest, yet it is an vnnaturall sléepe, it maketh the affected faint harted, fearefull and carefull, the color of the face is red and blew, with a sower taste in the mouth: if the patient be old, if it be about the Autumne, then are the signes the surer. Thou shalt vse those remedies for this maladie which are prescribed against melancholie, as sufficiently shall appeare hereafter. Also vse this Clister: Take Mallowes, Violet leaues, Buglosse, Fumitorie, Bran, of each one M. Polipody, Epithymus, or Dodder, of each one drag. boile them together in a sufficient quantitie of water, take twelue or sixtéene ounces of this decoction, oile of Oliues, thrée ounces. Stronger Clisters
shalt thou find elsewhere described. Thou maist also make these or the like suppositories: Take Coloquint, Salamoniacke, of each one dragme, Oxe gall two dragmes, sodden or boyled hony three ounces: make them reasonable thicke and long: they are very effectuall and strong. Head-ach proceeding from emptinesse of the stomacke. §. 5. IT befalleth oftentimes, that this head-ach vexeth many euery day, especially before they eate or drinke any thing, and presently after meales departeth; wherefore to auoide this emptinesse of the stomacke, thou shalt euery morning take one bit of bread dipped in vineger, or in the iuice of Pomgranates, or veriuice. The order of diet in hote head-aches. THose that are troubled with a head-ach that procéedeth of heate, must altogether ab∣staine from wine, as hath bene alreadie said, and not eate any flesh at all or very lit∣tle: for both of them do ingender much bloud. Their meate must be thinges cold by nature, as Lettice sodden and stewed, Spinage, Purslaine, Panadoes, broths, béere and bread sodden together, Apples and Peares stewed, broths of veale, of hens, being sharpe∣ned with a litle veriuice. Their drinke shall be small beere, whay of milke, Barley water, with a little of the iuice of Pomegranates or Limons. Of Cephalaea and Hemicrania certaine paines of the head. §. 6. IF this head-ach do come with quicke and hastie puls, and with heate, then shall it séeme good first of all to purge the bodie: and if the circumstances of the infir∣mitie permit it, the patient shal vse this lenitiue medicine, which is thus prepa∣red: Take of the greater and lesser Endiue, Lettice, of each one handfull, Poppy heads, two ounces, séedes of Melons, Gourds, Cucumbers, and of Pompions, of each two dragmes, grosly beaten halfe an ounce; Violets, Roses, white and yel∣low Saunders, of each two dragmes: boyle them all in a sufficient quantitie of water, till the third part be consumed, then adde twelue ounces of Sugar, boile it to the consistence of a sirupe, and then clarifie it with the whites of egs. Of this giue to the sicke one ounce and a halfe at once, with the water of Borage, or Endiue, or Buglosse: vse this thrée or foure times euery morning. Because there is a great vse of sirupes in this booke,How to make sirupes. I will now shew and set downe the per∣fect order and way how to make and prepare them. First sée thou haue fresh and cleare water, with which thou wilt make thy sirupe: put into it those things first which are hardest, as rootes, woods and such like, let them boile as long as thou wouldest séeth a couple of egs: then cast into it thy séedes grosly beaten, then thy hearbes being cut, after them thy flowers and Currants: let them boile well together, that their strength may come foorth, and if Epithymus be one of the in∣gredients, let it be put in last of all, & when it is sodden sufficiently, adde thy hony or sugar vn∣to it, and clarifie it with the whites of egs, as hath bene taught in the Introduction, namely, in the clarifying of Sugar: after this manner maist thou also deale in the purifying of hony. But to come to the purpose againe; thou shalt note, that if the choler be supple and thin, then shalt thou take sirupe of Endiue, of Violets, of water Lillies, of each three drag. admixed with the aboue named waters: if the choler be grosse and thicke, then take in stead of the sirupes, the like quantitie of Oxysaccharū compos. Rasis counselleth to giue this purgation after it: Take Da∣maske Prunes ten drag. sowre Dates one ounce: boile them in a sufficient quantitie of water: in this decoction steepe the rind or barke of yellow Mirobalans two dragm. grosly beaten, the next day strain and presse out all the liquor, and giue three or foure ounces of it in the morning. Others boyle Violets and water Lillies, of each one ounce, Stechas or French Lauander, two ounces, with halfe an ounce of Mirobalans: this alwaies giue at the first. They are both of them easie and safe purgations: for which cause also it is found good sometimes (according to
néed) to adde thrée graines of Diagridium to them, or else to mixe with them of the conserue of Prunes, or of Electuarium de succo Rosarum, thrée dragmes. Also in stead of the foresayd potion or drinke, thou mayest vse this confection that followeth: Take of both the confections before na∣med, of each halfe an ounce, sirupe of water Lillies as much as sufficeth to mixe them withall, and cast some Betonie rootes powdered and a little Sugar vpon it. Likewise if thou hadst rather vse pils: take two dragmes of Rubarbe, Mastix one scruple, Scammonie halfe a dragme: make pils of them with the iuice of Rue, or with wine, and take a dragme at one time of them. For the same purpose are sower Dates approued to be an especiall good remedie, and may in this hot kinde of headache very safely & with very great effect be adhibited. But thou must take thrée or fower ounces of them at once, as thou mayest behold their description and vertues in our Introductiō. This manner of purging is set for an example, which according to the circum∣stances both of the disease and of the diseased, may either be changed or vsed at pleasure. The body then being purged, the oyle of Roses, or of water of Lillies shall be dropped, or by some other meanes put into the patients nose, and let him smell to Camfere, Rose water, or the water of Violets. Or take oyle of Violets, of Roses, of water Lillies of each half an ounce, Cam∣fere thrée graines: rub them well togither, and put them into his nose. In like sort also take oyle of the seedes of Gourds, Willow leaues, and oyle of Roses, and vse it as before: likewise in place of the foresaid oiles, thou maiest vse cooling herbs, as Night-shade, Housleeke layd to the forehead with tow and double linnen clothes. Also to the same end is wo∣mens milke mixed very well with the white of an eg, and so layd to the forehead especially ap∣proued: or let the patient bath and rub his legs with the decoction of Vine leaues, water Lillies, Violets, Gourds, Cucumber, & Melon leaues; & if for all this the paine would still increase, thou maiest mixe two or thrée graines of Opium or Camfere with it, and often iterate the dropping of the oyle of Willow leaues into the eares and nostrils: for this purgeth the head greatly. But sée thou forget not that which before hath bin sayd de Narcoticis and obstupefactiue things. A sweete ball for the headache approued: Take Violets, water Lillies, Willow leaues, Ro∣ses, of each one ounce, Camfere two graines, beate them all togither, & binde them vp togither in a fine péece of silke or linnen cloth, and wet it often with a little Rose water. Others beate the foresayd simples into fine powder, and with molten waxe make it vp in forme of a ball; but this is not so good. Many such like cooling bals are described in the treatise of the plague, in two di∣uers places of the sixt part, as well to recreate and restore the sicke, as to preserue the sound. Headache proceding of the sunne or south winde. §. 7 IF the paine of the head be caused by the heate of the sunne, then may it easily be remedied with the aboue described Oxyrrhodinum, vnguent of Roses, the cooling vnguent of Galen, &c. And if those would not suffice, vse the iuices of the before named cold herbes. Also the oyles of Roses, of Violets, mixe with them as much strong vineger, as thou takest of one of the oiles, beate them well togither, dip a wollen cloth in it, & lay it where the paine is. Furthermore, the patient shall obserue and kéepe the same diet that is aboue set downe in the Chapter of Cepha∣lalgia: eate things light of digesture, abstaine from al things that might any way trouble or vexe the head, and if neede require, to purge with cooling medicines, as aboue is already shewed. Headache that commeth of drunkennesse. §. 8. OF the disease that procéedeth from drunkennesse, shall be spoken hereafter: now we wil only intreate of headache without any other infirmitie adioining with it. Néedelesse it is at this present to recite any signes of this kinde of headache, for that euery thing is most euident, whether this paine take her beginning of drunkennesse by wine or béere. The first remedie is to vomit; the second, to sléepe long, to fast it out, the broth of Colewoorts, or of Béetes a good quantitie being taken: also to drinke much cold water, and to eate sower fruits; but the best meate is first of all to eate sodden Lentils, Colewoorts and Pullets dressed with veriuice or Limons. The
patient shall also smell to Roses or Camfire: let the vttermost partes of his bodie be rubbed, drinke wine allayed with water, and two dayes after eate astringent and binding meats, with Pomegranates. The first day also shall it not be amisse to annoint the forehead and temples with the oyle of Roses, the next day with the oyle of Cammomill or of Lillies: and if perad∣uenture the paine as yet would not cease, he shall (as néede doth require) be purged, especially if any vapours ascend vp into the head. Likewise he may also vse this powder following: Take Colewoort séedes, Barbarie seedes, Endiue séedes, Lentils, Roses, calcined or burnt Iuorie, or Elephants tooth, of each two drag. make it into a very supple powder, giue of this two drag. at once, Camfire prepared, three graines, with the sirupe of Pomegranates or Citrons. Headach proceeding of a stroke or fall. §. 9. IF any one were hurt in the head by a stroke, a fall, or the throwing of a stone with∣out any wound or breaking of the skin, or fracture of the skull, he shall first of all be let bloud in the head veine, and afterward (if need require) take a common Clister: and (if he haue not an ague) he shall be purged with Pilulae Cochiae. And first of all lay on his head being shauen, this that followeth: Take the shelles and flowers of Pomegra∣nates, the iuice of Sloes, Hyppocystis, fine Bole, Sanguis Draconis, Terra sigillata, of each one drag. beate them all into powder, mixe it with the whites of egs, and lay it vpon the place affected or bruised. Or take the decoction of Roses, of Mirtle seed, or of Willow leaues, applying it three or foure times a day: then take oyle of Mirtles, and of Roses, of each one ounce, Mirtle seedes, iuice of Sloes, Hyppocystis, of each one dragme, mixe them together with a little molten waxe, & if there be no suffusion or congealed blood, annoint the place wt it two or three dayes together. Thou maist also make a pultis of Roses, Cammomill, and Melilot flowers, adding a little fine Bole to it, and mixing it with the oyles aboue named. If an ague be present, vse either cold or lukewarme things: also let him smell to cooling things, as Violets, Camfire, Willow leaues, and Mirtle leaues, &c. The second Chapter. Of the paine of the head that is caused by cold. IF the paine of the head proceede of cold flegmaticke humours and con∣tinue long, then are these the signes: wearisomnesse of all the partes, and as if all the bodie were beaten and broken into peeces: the paine is not extreame, without any swelling or thirst, fleepinesse, much spitting at the mouth, much moisture at the nose: for such like humidities do daily in∣crease in the diseased; the face is alwaies palely coloured, and somewhat swollen, the eyes run, and the mouth is quite out of tast. In such cold headaches, must contrarie remedies be vsed, that is, warming and dry∣ing medicines. Also we must begin here likewise with the gentlest and easiest remedies first, as this example following sheweth: which alwaies must be holden in the mouth, chewing it continually, and casting foorth the slime and spittle, which thereby is gathe∣red. Take Mastix, Nutmegs, Diptamer of Candie, Pepper, Stauesaker, Pellitorie of Spaine, Cubebs, Ginger, bound vp in a little cloth. The manner of purging in this infirmitie. §. 1. SEeing that purging is very needfull in this kind of head-ache, purge therefore both head and bodie in manner as followeth: Take Sage, Lauander gentle, Bayberies, wild Mints, Hysope, Marioram, sweet Marioram, garden Mints, Calmus, of each one M. seedes of Fennell, Persley, Sparage, Endiue of each two dragmes, Raisins, Nux Pinea, seedes of Melons, of Pompions, of Gourds, and of Cucumbers, Roses, rootes of wild Smallage, Annise seedes, of each halfe an ounce, Cubebs, Pionie seedes, Cloues, Nutmegs, of each a drag and a
half, Spikenard of India, Ginger, Cinnamom, Pepper, of each halfe a drag. boyle these things in a sufficient quantitie of water, then presse out all the moisture from them, & boile it the second time with honie or Sugar to the consistence of a sirupe. This if thou wouldest haue to purge, adde vnto it seedes of wild Saffron, Hermodactils, of each half an ounce, Agaricke six dragmes, Salt gem halfe one scruple, Turbit two dragmes: knit vp these togither in a little bag, & boyle them in the foresayd liquor. Afterwards sharpen thy sirupe with the vineger of Squils as fol∣loweth. Of this sirupe thou mayest giue one ounce and a halfe, or two ounces at once, mingled with good wine, or else with some other distilled waters that may serue to the same end, thrée or fower dayes continually togither. nell of Squiom∣.The composition of the vineger of Squils is as followeth: Take the Squill (called in Latin Scilla) take away the externall shels from it, till thou come to the white: these white ones take off by themselues seuerally with thy hād, or else with a wooden Spattin or knife, and not with iron, for that is hurtful: also leaue out the hart, the innermost part of the Squill, and take onely the middle white shiuers of it: fasten all these on a thred, that the one touch not the other, and hang them vp to dry fortie dayes in a coole place and in the shade. But this way that followeth, is much better: Take away all the vttermost parts vntill thou come to the white, then wrap it vp in dow, and bake it in an ouen: afterwards part it in shiuers as before, & drie it as is alrea∣dy sayd. Take of this dried Squils as much as thou wilt, cut it into little péeces with a wood∣den or bene instrument, put fower times as much vineger vpon it in a glasse and let it so conti∣nue fortie dayes in the sunne. Hauing taken the foresayd potion as hath bin taught before, thou shalt giue him Pillula Co∣chiae. If thou wilt haue them strong, take two dragmes of them; Coloquint, Bdellium, of each one scruple, make them into pils with the water of Sage: of these giue but one dragme at one time bicause they be very strong: to the same purpose likewise serue the pils Alephangina, Aureae, & Aloes prepared, being taken a dragme at once. But if the sicke would rather take a potion than these pils: Take Lauander gentle, flowers of Borage and Buglosse, Currans, of each one ounce, Basill séede one dragme, Agarick, Turbit, of each one dragme, boyle them in a sufficient potion of water, vntill there remaine about ten ounces, steepe in this liquor one ounce & a halfe of the barkes of Mirobalans called Chebuli, & set it so in warme ashes all one whole night: then presse it out hard, and giue three ounces of it at once. Also take Hiera picra, Agarick, of each one dragme, Lauander, Saffron, of each one scruple, Salt gem, two graines, mixe them with some broth that Nutmegs & Sage hath bin boyled in. In like manner mayest thou vse this that fol∣loweth: Take honie of Roses, sirupe of Stechas, of each thrée dragmes, Agarick, Turbit, of each two scruples, Spica, three graines, prepared Turpentine, halfe an ounce; beaten to powder all what thou canst beate, melt thy Turpentine in some hot broth, & when it is as cold that it may be drunken, mixe the powders and sirupes with it, & giue it early in the morning. This must be either diminished or augmented in qualitie, according to the abilitie of the patient. If the diseased can beare no kinde of Phisicke, then vse this Clister: Take Mallowes, herbe Mercurie, Dill, Rue, Bran, of each one handfull, boyle them in a sufficient quantitie of water, take of Colatare twelue or sixtéene ounces, mixe with it of Hiera picra, of white Sugar, of each halfe an ounce or somewhat more, Salt, two dragmes, oyle of Dill and Rue, of each one ounce and a halfe, and minister it warme. Gargarismes also are very good for this maladie, bicause they draw forth a great deale of slime and filthinesse from the head. Take Mastix, Calmus, Licorice, Currans, of each halfe an ounce, Hissope, Ireos, of each two dragms, Pellitorie of Spaine, Saxifrage, Ginger, Mustard seedes, of each one dragme, beate them all togither, and boyle them in fresh water: vse it thrée or fower times a day warme. Some do counsell to take a vomit of Radish water and Oxymell, but it is not without some danger, for that it doth oftentimes greatly disturbe the head: otherwise it might do some good. There are also diuers confections & Electuaries made for the same, which might warme and drie a cold and a moist braine: Take conserue of Roses two ounces and a half, conserue of Be∣tonie one ounce and a half, gréene Ginger half an ounce, Cinnamom one dragme, Cloues, An∣nise seedes, of each one dragme, beate & mixe them all togither: and if it be too dry, adde as much of the sirupe of Citrons vnto it, as shall suffice, or as much of any other sirupe. Of this ehibite euery morning the bignesse of a nut in quantitie.
Another Electuarie of life. This is described by Paulus Riccius,Paulus Ric∣cius Phisiti to the Empe∣rour his Ele∣ctuarie. head Phisition to the Empe∣rour Maximilian, and is very comfortable for the head, for it doth both warme and dry it. Take Currans six ounces, Licorice, two dragmes, boyle these in the waters of Buglosse, Scabious, and Betonie, of each twelue ounces; then straine it & presse out all the humiditie, in the which, being yet warme, stéepe one dragme of Rubarbe, Lauander fiue graines: being bound vp togi∣ther in a cloth, put them togither in a pot, and stop it close, and boyle it a good while in a kettle with water, presse it out and put into it as much Rubarbe and Spike as before, letting them there remaine all a night, presse it out againe as before, and steepe in it the barkes of Miroba∣lans, to wit, Chebuli, Indi, Bellirici, and yellow Mirobalans, of each one ounce, Emblici two drag∣mes, boile them al togither, and straine them through a linnen cloth; then ad Sugar six ounces, Manna two ounces, and let it boyle to the consistence of a sirupe: when it beginneth to coole, mingle in it Cinnamom halfe an ounce, Cloues, Galingale, Nutmegs, of each one dragme, La∣gnum Paradisi halfe a dragme, séedes of Fennell and Annise, of each halfe an ounce: mixe them well togither, and reserue it in a gally pot. This following is likewise greatly commended for the same: Take conserue of Betonie, thrée ounces and a half, conserue of Sage two ounces and a halfe, conserue of Rosemarie one ounce and a halfe, conserue of Borage and Buglosse of each one ounce, of the foresayd confection of life two ounces, Cinnamom two dragmes, preserued Chebuli halfe an ounce, preserued Emblici two dragms, sixe leaues of beaten gold, ad as much sirupe of Betonie as may suffice. This confection also comforteth the hart:Calamus Aro∣maticus The right Calamus Aromaticus of the ancient Phisitiōs, as it is described in the beginning of the eight part of this present booke, taketh away all cold headaches, and sharpneth the wit. Another conserue which is greatly commended for this kinde of headach: Take Cinnamom one ounce, Cubebs, Mirobalans, Chebuli, and Emblici, of each two dragms, red Rose leaues, red Saunders, red Corall, of each one dragme, Cardamonie, Mace, Cloues, Nutmegs, of each halfe a dragme, Sugar sixteen ounces, dissolue your Sugar in rose water and Lauander water: boile it till it be hard, and make it vp into a cake or Manus Christi. What vertues the confects of Coriander, Annise séedes, Fennell séedes, Commin séedes, bit∣ter Almonds, Haselnutg, and such like haue to helpe, comfort and strengthen a cold braine, as al∣so how they kéep backe and hinder the fuming vapors that would ascend from the stomacke in∣to the head, is at large declared in the eight part. An especiall medicine of the ancient Phisitions for the cold headache. CUt the rootes of Horseradish small, drie them and beate them into powder, giue of this one spoonefull in wine or broth, and let him sweate in his bed very well, and fast two howers after it. Let his meate be light of digesture, as pullets, and such like. But I must needes mislike of this remedie, for that the Horseradish is very strong, and doth more harme than good to the braine: neither séemeth it any way conuenient to sweate vpon. Certaine wines composed for the cold headache. TAke Rosemarie two M. Nutmegs one ounce, dried Betonie 2. ounces, Cloues two dragmes being cut very smal, put vpon them eight quarts of good Rhenish wine, let them so stand togither three or fower dayes. For the weaknesse of the stomacke drinke a good draught of it in the beginning of thy meales: but for the headach, at the latter end. This wine is very good for a cold and moyst braine, and hurtfull for yong folkes and hot complexions. Another for the same: Take rootes of Buglosse one M. rootes of Cicorie halfe as many, flowers of Buglosse, of Borage, of Roses, of Rosemarie, Harts tong, of each halfe a M. boyle them in fower quartes of wine the space that thou maiest boyle an eg hard: let it coole, straine it, and then take fower quarts of wine more, and stéepe in it sixe Sage leaues, and as much Rose∣marie, long Pepper one ounce, Galingale one ounce and a halfe, Cloues, Cubebs, of each halfe
an ounce, Cardamonie two drag. Cinnamom, Currans prepared, Coriander séeds, of each one ounce: these things being well beaten, tye them in a cloth, and boyle them with the wine, but not aboue twentie bubbles; then put both wines together in a little rundlet, and let the spices stéepe in them eight dayes together, pressing them out once a day. If this wine be too strong for thy drinking (as it is most like to be) then mixe other wines therewithall before thou drinke it. Of other Cephalicall herbes and spices, thou shalt find a description in the eight part of this booke. Hitherto we haue aboundantly treated of cold headaches with their appropriate remedies internall: now because that outward applications oftentimes are of no lesse effect than the in∣ward medicines, I do purpose at this present to set downe diuers externall remedies. manders  the cold .A Muske ball for the same: Take Laudanum halfe an ounce, Lignum Paradisi, Styrax Calamita of each one drag. Cloues, Nutmegs, Basill séedes, of each halfe a drag. Rose water with which a little Muske is dissolued, make it vp into a ball: if thou adde a small quantitie of Amber, it will be the better. Thou shalt find diuers sorts of these sweet smelling bals in sundrie places of this booke described. These bals are made after this manner: Take a warme mortar and pestell, and put into it a little of the foresaid Rosewater, with the Laudanum and Waxe: stir them with the pestell to∣gether till they be molten, then mixe the other powders with them, except the Muske & Amber, and make it vp in bals of what bignesse thou please; last of all, pricke them full of litle holes, but not very déepe, into the which thou shalt put the Muske and Amber mixed first with Rose wa∣ter: then take some finely prepared Cotton, wipe the mortar with it, and wrap the swéet ball in it, or kéepe it in a little red péece of sindal. It is also good to snuffe vp some of the foresaid powder into the nose, or else a little muske. To perfume with all: Take Frankencense, wood of Paradise, Mastix, Nutmegs, Styrax Ca∣lamita, of each by it selfe, or of them all as much as thou wilt. Also take Frankencense, Sandara∣cha, wood of Paradise, of each a like quantitie: throw it on glowing coles, and receiue the vapor or smoke. The manner of making lyes and sopes for the same, with which the head being washed the braine is comforted, her moisture dried, and her ouermuch cold changed into warmth, for which purposes thou shalt vse these things following: Take Roses, Sene leaues, Betonie, Marioram, Agaricke, of each one drag. steepe them in hote lye the space of foure or fiue houres: others first boile them in wine, and afterward mingle it with lie. Take Mace thrée drag. Stechas, Marioram, of each one drag. blossomes of the wild Vine, Roses of each two drag. Spica one drag. cut them all into small péeces, put them into a litle bag, and then steepe them in the ley: this comforteth the head, braine and memorie, and helpeth also the swimming or giddinesse of the head. Also take Spica halfe an ounce, Lauander flowers, Roses, Marioram, Rosemarie, rootes of the blew flower deluce, of each two drag. cut them into péeces, and being put into a bag, stéepe them in ly, and wash thy head with it: this strengtheneth the braine, all the senses, and the me∣morie very much. Also take wild Mints, Nep, course Marioram, Hyssope, Bay leaues, of each sort two M. Rosemarie blossomes, Stechas, Gold flowers of each halfe a M. and séeth them in ly: take also Marioram, Sage, Cammomill, Bay leaues, Stechas, of each a M. lay them in stéepe in the wa∣er of ly, as is aforesaid. Washing bals for the cold paine of the head.Here followeth diuers sorts of washing bals very méete and necessarie for the cold, and hu∣mors of the head. Take Venice Sope, halfe a pound, bruise it and stampe it in a warme mortar with a hote pestell, and make it somewhat moist with Rosewater, or Lauander water, vntill it be like vnto dowe, then beate one ounce of Ireos roots, Cloues, Nutmegs, Cinnamom, Carda∣monie, Stechas,, of each a drag. Roses, Basill, Rosemarie, Lauander blossomes, of each halfe a drag. all dried and beaten to powder, and then mingle the same with the dowe of the Sope, and take oyle of Spikenard, and rubbing your hands therewithall, then make vp the bals. Also prepare or dresse the Sope in like sort as before is mentioned, and then mingle there∣withall these powders hereafter following, to wit, Lauander halfe an ounce, Roses, Marioram, Basill, of each a quarter of an ounce, Ireos 3. quarters of an ounce, Benzoin, Styrax Calamita, Stechas, of each a drag. Spike a quarter of an ounce, and mingle them with Rose water. Then
annoint the temples of the head, and it will giue a very sweet smell or fume, and comfort the head and braine. Also take of the foresaid Sope prepared in the like manner as before is specified, two ounces, and mixe therewithall a quarter of an ounce of Agaricke: Ireos, Cloues, of each half a dragme, Camfire a scrup. Then make bals thereof in what sort you desire them. Also take Venice Sope foure ounces, Ireos, Cloues, Betonie, of each thrée dragm. Mario∣ram, Macis, Galigan, Lignum Aloes, Ciperus, Calmus, Sandaracha, of each a scrup-liquid Sti∣rax a drag. and a halfe, Muske foure graines, then dresse the Sope with Lauander water, as before is specified. Also heretofore in Chap. 1. §. 2. is mentioned, how the strong smell of the Sope may be taken away and made very commodious and fit for vse to diuerse purposes. Here is to be noted, that if the bals be for present vse, then are the bags herafter mentioned not néedfull: but for the bags, you are to take drie Betonie a M. Borage, Melilot, Millet a little dried in a pan, of each halfe an ounce, Rosemarie flowers, Stechas, of each a quarter of an ounce; make the bag so great, as the place of the griefe, and put the same therein, and lay it to the place where the griefe is. This following is stronger: Take drie Betonie, Rue, of each half a M. Rosemarie blossomes, Stechas of each an ounce, Basill séede, Rue, of each halfe an ounce: beate them in a mortar together, and put them in a little bag, and lay them to the head. Millet scorched or dried a quarterne: the like quantitie of salt, and also as much Cammomill, put them in a little bag, and lay them warme vpon the head: this is also very good. Also take Stechas, Cammomill, wild Mints, Marioram, Bay leaues, of each a handfull, Sene leaues, Cyprus, Citron shels, of each two drag. Cubebs, Nutmegs, Cloues, of each a drag. Macis, Spike of India, Ciprus rootes, Calmus, of each two drag. beate these together in a mortar; then put the same into two litle bagges: and if thou wilt haue it warmer, then take Doues doung and Mustard séede, of each thrée dragmes, Beuer cod, and Euphorbium of each a dragme. Note also very specially, that neither Roses nor other stopping things be put in the bags, nei∣ther are these plaisters following, in any wise seruiceable; and although they be strong, yet do they but hinder the diuiding of the matter. Therefore you shall not vse the bagges in certaine houres after you haue washed it with the Sope before mentioned. A powder for the head: Take Nutmegs, Macis, Rosemarie, Cloues, Frankencense, Mar∣ioram, Lauander, Stechas, of each a like quantitie, beate it small, and rub the head well there∣withall vpon the seame of the head, and then couer and kéepe warme the head with a cap, that the smell of the powders may the longer remaine. Also take Betonie, Marioram, Stechas, Roses, of each a M. Sage, Rue, course Marioram, of each halfe so much, Rosemarie two drag. Citron shels one ounce, Barke of Frankencense, Myrrhe, Frankincense, Mastix, Sandaracha, of each halfe an ounce, Cloues halfe a drag. beate them all into powder. This is very good for the moist and rheumaticke head, to drie it and to procure warmth. Plaisters and salues: Take Aloes, Penniroyall, Citron shels, wilde Mints, Sandaracha, Frankencense, of each halfe an ounce, oile of Roses one ounce, Laudanum sixe ounces, beate these small in a warme mortar, with a warme pestell, put thereunto sixe ounces of molten waxe, the other being very small beaten, then spread it vpon leather, and couer it ouer with red farsnet: this shalt thou lay vpon the head of the partie grieued in the morning whilest he is fasting: this drieth very strongly, warmeth the head, and comforteth the braines. Another: Take of the best Laudanum two ounces, Maces, fiue dragm. Millet that is scor∣ched or dried two drag. Turpentine and oyle of Cammomil so much as shall be néedfull for one plaister, and then vse the same as before is mentioned. Some take foure ounces of Laudanum, and Horehound in the place of Mace. This plaister following is very strong, and of great heate: Take Beuer cod, Euphorbium Pepper, white Mustard séede, Styrax Calamita, Rue, Horehound, of each a like quantitie: this beate all together with wine vntill it be like dowe, and therof make cakes of a like waight, let them drie. When you will vse them, rub them with oyle of Costus (otherwise Balsam) or Cam∣momill oyle vntill it be made fit for a plaister or a salue, then lay it vpon the forehead: for it is very good for any old or cold paine of the head, but lay it not vnto the forehead onely, but also drop some into the eares, and it will be very warme, and therefore I do not counsell you to take
much thereof. This is of speciall account: Treacle or Mithridate, with the iuice of bruised Mints, make it thicke as pap, and then annoint the forehead therewithall in the time of rest, and principally in Hemicrania, and where you find the head most cold, there vse it oftenest. Also take the rootes of wild Cucumbers, wormwood, of each two M. séeth them together with a soft fire in thrée ounces of water, and as much common oyle, vntill it be sodden to a third part. With this moisture rub the head till it be wet, and of the rest make a plaister, and lay it to the place of the paine. Also take of the vsuall plaister Apostolicon foure ounces, make it soft with the oyle of Cam∣momill, and then rub the place of the paine therewithall. Alwaies vnderstanding that the haire is to be first cut off very close. Hereunto may also of the oyle of Spikenard, of Costus, of Beuer cod, of Cammomill, and Dil be vsed, of each a like quantitie, and then stamping all the foresaid herbes and rootes with them. Addition. The hearbes and simples that are vsed in a cold head-ach are these: Iris Illirica, oile of the wild Oliue, oile of Almonds, the seedes of the chast tree, bitter Almonds, Lana succida, wa∣ter Mints, the iuice of Iuie leaues, Aloes, Mints, wild Time, Melilot, the leaues of Bac∣charis, Rue, Scammonie, Annise, Dog Fennell, Git, the lesser Coniza, the young leaues of Ana∣gyris, Rhodia radix, Hippoglossa, Laurell, iuice of the wild Cucumbers, Galingale, Nardus Italica, Lauander, Valerian with the roote, Cinnamom, Cubebs, Muske, Siuet, Amber, oile of Baies, Mummie, Mastick, Agarick, water of Veruaine, Verbascum, Coloquint. For the heate and hote paine of the head, Priuet blossomes, drie Roses, Purslaine, the rootes of water Lillies, and of Rhodia, iuice of Poppie, the greater Housleeke, tame or garden Nightshade, Vine leaues, mosse of trees and stones, oile of Priuet, iuice of Plantaine, of Lettice, Fabaria beaten, Henbane, Muscilage of Fleawort, Mandrake, all manner of Housleeke, white Saunders, the decoction of Sene, Camfire, &c. Some of these are vsed onely inwardly, some onely outwardly, and some also both wayes, and for that cause they are not to be vsed without great circumspection. Of neesing for a cold and rheumaticke head. §. 2. MAny do aduise to prouoke néesing, for to cleanse the braine and head therby: but it is also to be doubted, that the same will rather distemper the head, so that it must prouidently be dealt with, as shall presently hereafter be expressed. Ther∣fore it is also needfull to speake somewhat of néesing, which doth men much good or ill. Néesing, Sternutatie, is a motion of nature, or of the expulsiue vertue to driue out all that hindreth the aire from the braines. Or, néesing is a speciall motion of the braines expelling superfluous moisture or matter, and that thorow the helpe of the attracted aire, which driueth out the same speedily thorough the mouth and nose. The causes of néesing are sharpe things, as Onions, Lillies, Hellebore, Pepper, Mustard∣seeds, and such like in smelling, eating and drawing them into the nose. To hold vp the nostrils against the Sunne, to tickle in them with some sharpe things. But for more safetie this is mine aduice, that Neesewort be refrained as much as is possible, as also Pieretrum, Euphorbium, and such like moe, and principally by themselues alone. In like manner, although the wild Cucum∣ber doth draw forcibly, yet notwithstanding it is a great deale too sharpe. But if it be found good aduice to vse neesing, then are these compounded remedies hereafter following much safer and milder to cleanse the head and braines: Take Marioram one quarter of an ounce, Nigella séedes, Rosemary flowers,Neesing powders. of each one dragme, Cloues two scruples; beate them small, and smell thereto. Item take beaten Marioram one quarter of an ounce, Pieretrum one scrup. Ginger one scru. white Hellebore nine graines, and beaten all small together.
Item take Pyretrum ten graines, Betonie a drag. Marioram one drag. and a halfe, and beate them all together. Item take Laudanum, Myrrhe, Amanacum, white Hellebore, of each one drag. Frankencense, Euphorbium, Coriander, Ginger, long Pepper, of each halfe a drag. these beaten all to fine pow∣der, it is very good for the cold murre. Item take Pyretrum, blacke Hellebore, of each halfe an ounce, white Hellebore, Beuer cod, of each two drag. Marioram halfe a drag. beate them to powder: of this vse but a little, and not very often; for it is very strong. Oile of Spike being put into the nose, doth prouoke néesing. There may also be drawne vp into the nose two ounces of Marioram water, and afterwards wash the forehead and face warme therewith. For what end néesing is commodious or hurtfull, you shall perceiue here and there in this booke. Lotions for the féete. All Phisitions do commend for sundrie sicknesses, and also for cold ach in the head, this lotion of the feete: Take Betonie, Roses, Elderne flowers, Cammomill, Mar∣ioram and Sage, of each foure handfuls: seeth them together, and euery euening put the feete deepe inough therein, and so continue about halfe an houre therein: this may be kept good three dayes together. If so be that the patient cannot sleepe he may vse this three or foure times a weeke: Take Cammomill, Melilot, Violet leaues, of each one handful, water Lillies, halfe a handfull, Pop∣pie heads broken in peeces one ounce: seeth and vse them as before. The order of diet for the cold paine of the head. §. 3. STrong wine is good, but not too much, to the end it do not disturbe the head: once in eight dayes he must bath & wash his head with the decoction of Cammomill, Mar∣ioram, and Stechas: or he may vse according to the importance of the sicknes, one of the foresaid lyes or sopes: before meales is his head to be rubbed with warme clothes, and after meates take a litle Marmalade, thereby to hinder the vapours of the stomack from ascending to the head, and prouoking of new paine. Outward bruisings of the head. §. 4. ALl outward bruisings or wounds of the head, whereof is not onely caused great paine, but also great perill of life, do belong chiefly to Chirurgerie, notwithstanding where we shall hereafter discourse of the Scull, somewhat shall be spoken thereof. What doth conuey the medicines towards the head. §. 5. WE haue hitherto described many kindes of remedies and medicines that are méete for the hot, cold, and other paines of the head: but because the laxatiue and purging medicines through their owne power do not expell all humors (for which they be giuen) out of all members indifferently, without the addition of such things as may conuey their operation towards some certaine member, the which one desireth to haue them to purge: therefore we will discourse here somewhat ther∣of. And that you may by example clearely vnderstand the same, then behold the Oxymel that shall immediatly be described: it prepareth or digesteth flegmaticke humours indiffe∣rently as well in one member as in another. But if so be you mixe therewith Nutmegs, Pionie séedes, or Cubebs, then doth it onely purge the head, and none other part of the bodie: and if you put thereto Tamariscus and Caper rootes, then doth it purge out of the milt, and so foorth with all the rest. Now because we write here onely of the head, these are the principallest simples or herbes, that do conduct the medicines towards the head; to wit, Nutmegs, Cubebs, and Pionie, Penniroyall, Marioram, Balsam wood and séedes, Frankincense, Beuer cod, Lau∣danum,
Melilot, the right Acorus, Lignum Aloes, Myrrhe, Chamedris, Squils, Nuces pinea, Spike∣nard, Gentian, Hysope, Pepper and Sagapenum or Serapinum. There are many things moe here and there discouered in this booke, which the diligent rea∣der shall find to be very méet for the headach. Additions vnto the paine of the head. FOr the forementioned pain of the head there are certaine things commemorated, that are commodiously and much vsed, & yet are not discouered how they shold be prepared. Thus, to the end the reader might be satisfied, we will here describe certaine of them, and begin with Oxymel. Diuers kinds of Oxymel. §. 6. FIrst we will begin with that which at the Apothecaries is called Oxymel sim∣plex: for that it is made onely of honie and vineger: now for to make the same, take clarified honie foure ounces, powre thereto two ounces of cléere water: séeth the same together, and scum it, vntill all the water be sodden away: put thereto two ounces of vineger, let it séeth together vnto a sirupe. This consu∣meth all tough slime and thick humors, openeth all obstructions, cleanseth the brest, and maketh an easie breathing. The second Oxymel is called at the Apothecaries Compositum or Diureticum. It is made in this manner: Take Fennell rootes, and rootes of Smallage, of each two ounces, the seedes of Parsley, of Butchers broome, of Sparage, of Smallage, and of Fennell, of each an ounce: take out the core of the rootes, chop them, and séeth them in a quart of water vntill they be mellow, afterwards wring them out thorow a cloth, and adde to the decoction sixe ounces of sharp vi∣neger, twelue ounces of cleansed honie, let them séeth together vnto a sirupe. This is much stronger for all vses then the former: it doth attenuate all tough slimes, it driueth them out of the members, openeth the obstruction of the liuer, of the milt, and of the kidneys, it expelleth the vrine and sweate. The third Oxymel is made of Squils called Scyllinum, or at the Apothecaries Squilliticum: for this, take vineger of Squils which is described before in the second Chapter, §. 1. against the cold paine of the head, foure ounces, clarified hony sixe ounces, and séeth it al together vnto a sirupe. The fourth is Oxymel Scyllinum compositum, the which is thus made: Take the roots of Smal∣lage; of Fennel, of each two ounces, the rootes of Parsley, of Butchers broome, of Sparage, the seedes of Smallage, and of Fennell, of each halfe an ounce: séeth them together in a quart of water vntill the roots be mellow: vnto this decoction adde twelue ounces of vineger of Squils, clarified hony 18. ounces, and then séeth it to a sirupe. They are both very good to attenuate the tough slimes, to strengthen the stomacke, and to prouoke vrine: but the first is stronger to open all obstructions, and is speciall good against all quotidian and quartaine agues. Purging sirupe of Roses. §. 7. TAke a pound of red or damaske Rose leaues, put them into a pot with a narrowe necke, powre thereon about thrée times so much of hote cleare water, let it stand so 8. or 12. howers couered very close, afterwards wring it hard out with thy hand, straine the liquor cleare thorow a cloth: then take againe fresh Roses as before, and powre the strained liquor séething hote vpon it, let it stand as before: wring it out againe, and do this afterwards 8. or 12. times together (the oftener the better) and it will be the stronger in purging. Lastly, wey all that strained iuice of Roses, and put halfe so much Sugar vnto it, and clarifie it with the white of an egge, vntill it be very cleare: afterwards let it seeth to a sirupe. Some do stampe the Roses, that the vertue might come out the better. Others do make it after this manner, as followeth: Take red or damaske Rose leaues two
pound and a halfe, powre thereon ten quarts of May deaw or cleare raine water made méetly hote: let them infuse together in a warme place a whole day and a night stopt very close. The next day wring it out hard: make the broth not séething, but onely meetely hote: then powre it againe vpon two pound of fresh Rose leaues: let them stand and stéepe, as before. The third time take one pound and a halfe of Roses; the fourth time one pound, and so the fift and sixt time: last of all, after the foure last times, take each time halfe a pound of Roses: afterwards, the liquor being strained, put vnto thrée parts of it one part of Sugar: seeth it well, clarifying it vnto a sirupe. Of one of these sirupes may be giuen to a full growne person three, foure, or fiue ounces at one time: vnto a young child one ounce: vnto one of eight or nine yeares old, two ounces, and further after the same rate, according to the greatnesse or smalnesse. This sirupe doth quench the thirst and heate in all hote agues, it doth strengthen the sto∣macke and the hote liuer, defendeth the heart from all venime and stinch: therefore it is also good for the plague, and looseth very gently. It is also prepared with Rubarbe and other things, according to the opinion of euery Phi∣sition. Barley water. §. 8. IT is ordained before, for the hote paine of the head, to giue vnto the sicke body Barley water for his daily drinke, the which is prepared after diuers maners, but is commonly prepared thus: Take vnto a good deale of water one ounce of péeled Barley, let it séeth vntill it breake. Some do steepe it two or thrée houres before in cleare water. And albeit that such Barly water haue small force, yet it is better than bare water, when the patient is forbidden to drinke wine. There are also other things moe, according to the importance of the sicke person, put vnto it, as Masticke, Barberies that do colour it like vnto wine. In like manner are also hearbes, rootes, and all that one will, decocted therein. Manus Christi with Pearles. §. 9. THis cordiall Sugar is very common, and is made thus: Take 12. ounces of the whitest Sugar, seeth it with Rose water like as is taught in our introduction, af∣terwards when it beginneth to be cold, stir an ounce of prepared Pearles amongst it, and make Tabulates or Manus Christi of it. It is good for all faintnesse, hote agues, heauie fantasies and imaginations. The Apothecaries do commonly not take more then a dragme of Pearles vpon a pound of Sugar, because men will not go to the cost thereof. Without Pearles the Apothecaries do call it Manus Christi simplex, they decoct the Sugar with Rose water, without putting any thing else vnto it. It is made also with violet water, Cinnamom water, and howsoeuer that one will haue them. The third Chapter. The Haire of the Head. EVen as we haue discoursed of all kind of paines of the head, so we wl now begin certaine other things of the same in particular, and of that which maketh shew outwardly in the top of the head, to wit, the hae, the which groweth there of it selfe, garnisheth the head, decketh and o∣uereth it. And although the same haire (like as the nailes also) hath no other gouernment but onely the growing and garnishing by nature: neuerthelesse it hath that secret in it, that thorow his colour, his hard∣nes, softnesse, finenesse, curling, euennesse, and other marks, it doth suffi∣ciently giue knowledge how the braines which lye vnder it are in∣clined; to wit, the cold, warmth, drith, moisture, as also their mixed complexions, as cold and drith, warmth and moisture, whereby it may be knowne what humor or moisture doth most
abound, or whether ones haire also wil quickly fall off or not. These weightie and other causes haue planted by nature in all men, specially in women, a carefulnesse to looke vnto, and main∣taine it: the one with making it grow more or thicker than the other, to change the colour, to make it fall away, to keepe it cleane from all vermine, and to frée and cleare it from all defaults. Because therefore that this is so greatly estéemed, it is requisite to prosecute our attempted me∣thod, and to write also somewhat thereof. And first of all, of those things which cause the haire to growe: afterwards, to take that away which hindereth, or to draw or plucke it out. To cause the haire to grow, and to colour it. §. 1. ALl they that desire to haue their haire grow thicke and apace, are to annoint the place oftentimes with honie where they will haue it growe: also to make a ley of herbes (to wit, for young maydens and women) who beare the name thereof, Gallitrichon, faire haired, Politrichon, much haire, Capillus Veneris: Venus haire. And if any bodie haue a bald patch: then take garden snails pluckt out of their houses, Horsleaches, Bées, Waspes, Salt, of each a like quantitie: powne them not too hard one amongst another, put them into a glassed pot that is pitched beneath, and hauing a smal hole, burie it the space of eight dayes in warme horse dung, and receiue the moi∣sture that droppeth out in another glasse bound vnder it: and annoynt therewith the baldnesse, rubbing well the place first: wash the head with the decoction of vrine, Wormwood, Southern∣wood, and of Lineseede well parched: goates milke doth likewise make the haire growe faire. You shall also find moe things hereafter in the description of the eye browes, and of the beard. Of the dying of the haire in generall. §. 2. IF any desire to dy the haire otherwise than it is grown by nature, then is this ge∣nerally to be obserued: that he alwaies before wash the haire with ley made of vine stockes, wherein a peece of Allum is dissolued: for the Allum maketh a prepara∣tiue for to receiue all colours, as is well knowne to all Dyers. Here do now follow certaine sorts of colours. Amongst Dutchmen there is no colour more highly commended then the gold colour or yel∣low, like as it was much esteemed of the Romaines: so that sometimes they dyed their beards and haire with gold: but these things following are also meet for this purpose. Yellow haire.Take ashes of the Vine stickes, eight ounces, of Barley straw two handfuls, of Licorice two ounces, seeth them together in a great quart of water; afterwards let it settle, and wash the head with this ley, and let it drie of it selfe. Item take shauen Beechen wood, Gold flowre, Venus or maiden haire, of each one hand∣full, Licorice halfe an ounce, Saffron one scrup. let this mollifie in ley, wash the head, and let it drie of it selfe: also as often as one combeth him, he must wet the combe therein. Item take Willow leaues, white beaten Mustard seede, Consolida Saracenica, broad Plan∣tain, Water Cresses, Radishes, white Hellebore, Bryonie, Onions, of each halfe an ounce: cut them all in péeces, and let them seeth al together a while in ley, temper one ounce of Honie a∣mongst it, and then let it stand vntill the hearbes do putrifie: afterwards put more fresh herbs therein, and seeth them with as much honie as there is of the decoction, vntill it be thicke, and annoynt the place where you desire to haue the haire grow: but looke well to it that you touch no other haire with it, for it would be disordered thereby, but I aduise no man to vse much of this salue, for it is hurtfull for the head. Item in March take Poplar buds and séeth them with ley; take also powned Colewoort seede, temper it with the oyle of Walnuts like to a salue, and annoynt the head therewith. Or take nettle rootes, horse Radish, the gumme of the Birch, make it hote vpon the fire with the ley, and wash the head therwith. Iuniper oyle annointed thereupon after washing, will ea∣sily make yellow haire to grow: but note that this oyle is hote. This should also the fruite of the Béechen tree do, being laid in ley. Black haire.Blacke haire: Some that by nature haue blacke haire, do diligently seeke to augment that colour: others will cloke therewith the mishapen haire, many will dy gray haires therewith,
which to effect, they annoint it with the iuice of Sage. Burne Hasell nuts, as many as you please, in a luted potte, stampe them to powder, then make them vnto a salue with the tallow of a Beare or Goate: this doth not onely dy black, but maketh also the haire to grow. Item take beaten Gal nuts sixe ounces, seeth them in nine ounces of Sallet oyle, as long as one would seeth an egge hard: afterwards wring them out, mixe amongst it pounded Priuet, burnt Vitriol, Salt gem, of each one quarter of an ounce: let it seeth a good while together, ha∣uing washed the haire with the decoction of Blites and Elderne flowers, then make it fat with the foresaid oyle. Item take the green shales of Walnuts, stampe them and seeth them, annoint the haire with it, and it will be as blacke as Pitch. For this also helpeth Cipers nuts, Beane straw, burnt shales of Hasell nuts, peeles of Pomegranates, vnsleckt Lime, Priuet, and oyle of Nuts. For to make curled haire, take Mallowes layd in ley; if one would dy his haire gray,Curled haire. then make ashes of the innermost barke of Iuie, and wash you oftentimes therwith, or annoint your haire with Badgers grease. To hinder Gray Haires. §. 3. TO be gray, is onely proper to mans head, which commeth thorow the abatement of the naturall warmth, or thorough the ryoting life, whereby Flegma is in∣creased, and it is sometimes also caused as well thorough vnnaturall heate as cold: but if any be gray before his time, that commeth by vse of much fruite and fish: but to vtter the truth, the gray haires are none other then an Ensigne or ban∣ner for vs, that death planteth vpon our heads, signifying that it will shortly haue victorie ouer vs. But as there be many that would hide their age, and would rather be thought young men, them old fooles; So hath it bene also found out, not how to turne away gray haires, but how to preuent the same, whereof we will here write somewhat. The chiefest is the daily purging of flegme, and specially with vomits and clisters, for which are fit Pilulae Cochiae, Trifera Saracenica, these pils following. Take Coloquint, Turbith, Aloe, of each a dragme, Fennell seede, Annis séedes, Persley seede, blacke prepared Hellebore and Pepper, of each halfe a dragme, Diagridion two scrup. make thereof a masse with the iuice of Wormwood, take a dragme therof at the most at one time, for they be strong: good héed is to be taken in this purging, that age for gray haires be not thereby taken away. The auncient Phisitions do describe many things for preuenting gray haires, what is to be eaten, drunke, and refrained: also what is to be vsed a whole yeare in youth, and that one must eate snailes: so that it grieueth me to enter into so néedlesse a matter (when one would stay and preuent the course of nature) I will therfore be briefe. Annoint thy head with the oyle of Beuer cod, with the oyle of a Beare, fresh oile of Roses, or oile of Mustard séede: all which are méet to preuent gray haire: or take the spleene of an old dog, and rub the haire therewith. Also the oile of Priuet doth preuent gray haire. Item take Tassell, séeth it in ley and vse it daily: stéepe in the ley Mirtle leaues, Cipers nuts, Iuniper wood cut, the barke of Fir-wood with the leaues, Gall nuts, and such like. To take away haire. §. 4. TAke a pint of wine, drowne twentie gréene frogs therein, or as many as can be drowned therein, then set the pot forty dayes in the warme Sun: afterwards straine it hard thorow a cloth, annoint the place therewith where you wil take away the haire. Make the place oftentimes moist with the iuice of yellow Lillies, which is wild Flower deluce. Take Ants egs and rub the place therewith, wherein you would haue the haire taken away, it will fall off and grow no more againe. Item annoint the haire place with the iuice of Sloes, and it will make the hairie place bald and smooth. Will you plucke out haire without breaking the skin?To plucke out haire. Then take six ounces of Turpentine
set it on the fire in a new pot, and let it séeth somewhat; then powre it into a panne full of cold water, and stir it continually about with a woodden sticke vntill it run together. Then powre therein other fresh water, and plucke it with your fingers well from another, whereby it may be well washed; and do this so long, vntill it waxe faire and white; afterwards temper amongst it one ounce of beaten Masticke in the foresaid pot, séeth it all together as before, and wash it also afterwards as before is done, and kéepe it alwaies couered with water, and when you will vse it powre out the water: let it melt with the fire, spread it on a cloth, and lay it no where but on the place whence you would haue the haire drawne out, and when it is cold (as it will be quickly) pull off the plaister with violence. Then will the skin remaine very white and bare of haire, then haue a péece of fresh larde readie, and therewith annoynt the place, and then wipe it by and by away with a cloth: then will the skin be bald and smooth. Of diuerse defaults of the haire. §. 5. THe cunning & expert Phisitions do reckon nine kinds of defaults of the haire: Contorsio, Decoloratio, Quassatio, Fractio, Atrophia, Canities, Alopecia, De fluxio and Ophiasis. The first, Contorsio, is called a curling or intangling of the haire. The second, Decoloratio, a deformitie of the colour. The third, Quassatio, which is a splitting or cleauing asunder of the haire. The fourth, Fractio, a short breaking away of the haire, that it snappeth asunder. The fift is, Atrophia, that is as much as a drying away or consuming of the haire for lacke of foode. The sixt is Canities, when the haire before his due time becomes gray or white. The seuenth is Alopecia or Arca, which is bald∣nesse or falling off of the haire. The eight is Defluxio, which is also a falling away of the haire, like as in them who lost their naturall heate, or recouer after a long continued sicknesse. The last is Ophiasis, which hath her name of the snake: it is also a changing of colour not vnlike to the other; for it is parti-colouring like to a snake. Of baldnesse and falling off of the haire. §. 6. BAldnes and falling away of the haire is thrée fold: as the falling off of the haire of the head, of the eye browes, & of the beard. Of the two last we wil discourse in their place: here we will onely speake of the first falling away of the haire. The causes of the same are inflamed moistures, whereby the haire before was fed: which thorough inflammation thereof is taken away, as alreadie hath bin rehearsed: for whensoeuer that it wanteth sustenance, the haire must of necessi∣tie drie away, and fall off with his rootes, as may be séene in them that haue hote braines, and become bald betimes: and contrariwise women, children, and they that be gelded very seldome. Thus to speake of the meanes: the first proofe is, whether the haires may be restored or not, to rub the bald place: and if it be not foorthwith red, then is there no hope at hand: but if it wax red, then it is a signe that there is still some good bloud, and therfore good hope also. And to come vnto it, first must good order of diet be obserued, to refraine strong wine, Borage, reare egs, & all that is light of digesture is commodious for him, and to drinke white, cleare, and small wine, that is swéetish. Bathing and rubbing is very méete for this disease; if the person be full of bloud, open ye head veine, or that on the nose, or the veine behind the eares, and also purge, if it be néedfull, of whatsoeuer occasion it be that the falling away of the haire happeneth. These means following are alwaies conuenient for it: Take Euphorbium, burnt Hasill nut shels, burnt Chesnut shels, Cresses séedes, Indie Spica, Verbascum, of each one drag. bitter almonds with their pils burnt, one quarter of an ounce; make salue thereof with vine uict, oyle of Radishes or Barberies. Item take Euphorbium, wild Rue, Boreas, Mustard séed, Mugwoort, of each a like much; beate them all together and make therof a salue with the iuice of Onions: let the head be rubbed vn∣till it be red, and then annointed therewith. Of such like remedies are many more described by the auncient Phisitions: but omitting them, ye haue some here that are certaine and common. Take Pigeons dung, burne it to ashes, then powre ley vpon it, and let him be washed ther∣with. Or Hasell nuts with the shels beaten small, and tempered with Beares grease, is very good.
Oile of egs doth defend and kéepe the falling out, and maketh the haire for to grow againe where it is fallen away. Forasmuch as the oile of egges is so good for this, and for many other things more, it is needfull to teach here how to make the same. The oile of Egs and his vertue. Take hard sodden yolkes of egs as many as you will,Oile of Eg. breake them in peeces, and parch them in a pan vntill they waxe ruddy, then shall you sée oile run out: then without ceasing must you stir them about, and when they be throughly parched, presse them hard through a woollen cloth. It is many times approoued and found, that this oile doth not onely cause the haire that is fallen off to grow againe, but doth preuent and stay the haire from falling. It also healeth, and causeth all other itches and sores to heale. Further: Take wel salted Barly bread, burne it to powder, and temper it with Beares grease, and annoint your head therewith. Item slake a glowing steele in the ly wherewith you will wash you: vse it often without any thing else therein. Take Mirtle séeds and the leaues: séeth them in water, and wash the head therewith. All that is taught hereafter against the falling off of the haire in the eybrowes and the beard, is also méete for this purpose. Of the scales of the head, of the beard, and eyebrowes. §. 7. THe Latinists do call the scales of the head Furfures, which is bran, well knowne of all people, and are very common in al mens heads. They grow there through a hot complexion, and when they abound much & aboue custome, then were they wont to be messengers of leprosie. They that haue them so excessiue, do get them through a licentious life, and surfetting in eating and drinking, through incontinencie, strong wine, much vse of garlick, onions and mustard, whereby the blood is burnt to ashes. For this must one begin with purging, like as in all drie itches shall be expressed. But if the person haue much bloud, then is he to be let bloud; if not, then are to be vsed neesing powders, gargarismes, and boxing cups are to be set on the shoulders and necke, and afterwards these things: Seeth Mallowes or Venus haire in water, wash therewith the head and face, and al∣wayes rub well the head; or boile fennell séed, Licorice, Fleawort, Lupins, Hollihocke rootes, take out the muscilage as shall be taught hereafter, and temper them with the iuice of Melons. Item take Nuttrée wood, or Nut shels burnt to ashes, put them in the ly and wash you therwith. Item take Charuill, Southernwood, make a lie thereof with a little vineger. Item burne Hay flowers to ashes, and poure ly vpon it. Item take Elecampane rootes, and infuse them a good while in ly. Or take Storkes bill, let it séeth in water, and foment well the scales therewith, that they be well frothed, and afterwards lay the herbes on the top of it, and they will weare away. Will you yet haue stronger things? then take the gall of a Bull, Coloquint, Sal Alcali Boras, of each one drag. Gals, pils of Pomegranates and their blossomes, of each one scrup. and temper them together. Item take narrow Plantaine, Henbane séeds, and salt, of each a little, séeth them in water and rub the scales therewith: the same also doth Aqua vitae with Brimstone amongst it. Heretofore in the second chapter & §. 1. you haue a bag for ly, which beginneth, Take Spica &c. you may vse the same also for the scales, and put therto two ounces of Orenge péels, where∣of some of the white is cut away. For to draw the muscilage out of the séedes and rootes, the Apothecaries do call the slime drawne out of all séeds and rootes Muscilagines; it is much vsed in this matter, and is thus pre∣pared. Take rootes and séeds, chop and stampe each according to the qualitie,How to make the slime or muscilage of seeds & root. seeth them vntil the li∣quor be very slimy & muscilaginous: this being done, poure it al together into a long bag that is piked beneath, and bind it hard to a staffe; afterwards take two little boordes and fasten the said bag betwéene them, wring it hard from aboue downewards, then runneth the slime or musci∣lage out of it, receiue it in a cleane porrenger; and after this fashion wring or presse out all the slime that will come forth.
For to driue away Lice and Vermine. §. 8. Lice.THis lothsome and (especially to children) troublesome worme, hath his most abode in the foresaid haire of the head, and they do grow through moisture of the flesh, or (to speake properly) of a grosse and moist vapor that fumeth out at the pores, and through naturall warmth becometh outwardly a Louse, and receiueth also a vital spirit, and is altered into a litle worme with sixe feete, increasing and seeking their meate in the place of their generation: there∣fore are children and women more plagued then men that are drie by nature, and be much lesse hurtfull to yong children then to full growne persons, yet they haue this commodity thereby, that they that haue most lice be wholly fréed from the headach. Their cause.The cause whence they are ingendred, may be ouermuch eating and small digesture, or ea∣ting of meates that be very moist, as diuers fruites, and especially figs and chestnuts: also ouer∣much carnall copulation, vncleane clothes, and such as are worne ouerlong. Their reme∣dies.Now that one may be rid of this vermin, annoint the head with the broth of Salt fish, with the iuice of Alehoofe, the iuice of Fumitory mixt with Vineger: take Gentian and séeth it in ly, and wash the head therewith. Take Bay berries, or (if you haue them not) the oile of Bay, Vineger, powned Bay berries, burnt Harts horne, seeth them together in water or ly, and wash the head therewith. Salues. Take halfe a pound of Barrowes grease, mixe and temper amongst it one ounce of Quicksiluer, and one ounce of the oile of Bay, Licebane and white Hellebore, of each halfe an ounce, Salgem one dragme, and a litle vineger: temper them all together, and therewith annoint the head, and put a kercher on the head, and in the morning wash the head with lie. Another. Take Barrowes grease halfe a pound, beaten Liuer foure ounces, Wolues bane, and white Hellebore rootes, of each halfe an ounce, oile of Bay one ounce, temper amongst it one ounce and a half of quicksiluer so wel that one cannot sée it, salt one drag. vse a litle thereof, for it is strong. Item take vnprepared Coriander, séeth it in water, wash therewith the head, and all places where there are any lice, and wash the clothes in like maner, it driueth away lice and fleas: you may also try the same with Coriander leaues. Crab-lice.Against Crab-lice you are to vse all the former things. They grow of a stinking matter, that nature expelleth through the hairy skin, as in the eybrowes, beard & priuities: they are most pla∣gued with them that eate many kinds of meates, vse small exercises, and much bathing. For to consume this vncleane matter, he is to be purged with Pillulae Cochiae, and to vse oftentimes gar∣garismes with the sirupe of vineger, and a litle mustard séed, and to wash the place with Allume water, and salt water, or that wherein Stauesacre is decocted. Iem take Stauesacre and Allume, of each one drag. beate them together, temper it with hony, and annoint therewith: Others do take Salarmoniac, Aloe and Borras amongst it, and in stéed of hony, vineger of Squils: also the white of a rosted egge is commended for it, wrapt vp in a cloth, and held as hot vpon the place as may be suffered. This being done thrée or foure times, they will fall away. Lice in chil∣drens feete.Somtime yong children haue also lice growing in their féet: for them take new laid hen egs, let them be sodden hard, cut the white in péeces in the breadth; beate then the yolks, and with fine linnen rags lay it on the feet, and then the white vpon it; and so being well bound certaine houres, the lice will créepe to the white of the egge. The Lowsie euill, Phthiriasis, a miserable sicknesse. §. 9. EVen as we haue written of the Lice, so we wil adioyne thereto the Lowsie euil, which the Grecians do cal Phthiriasis. This is a wonderful and terrible sicknes, that a man should be eaten vp with such baggage worms, and so bereft of his life. It hapneth that these worms do bréed of moisture of a mans flesh, and begin commonly in the eybrowes, and in some scabs, or among some scurfe therein when they do breake of themselues or are opened. Then do lice créepe out, and so by little and little out of the whole body, with such danger, that very skilfull Phisitions haue inough to do therewith, and yet neuerthelesse are these medicines following
ordained for the same: Take the iuice of Fumitory, Borage, Germander, of each two ounces, Mirobalam, Chebuli, Indi, Citrini, of each foure scrup. blacke pepared Hellebore one quarter of an ounce, prepared Agarick half an ounce, Aloe three quarters of an ounce, Epithymum, Sene leaues, rootes of Polipody, of each one ounce: powne all that is to be powned, and temper them with the iuice; if it be too soft, let it dry, and forme a lumpe or masse, thereof take one drag, and make sie pils of it, of the which you are to take twice or thrice euery weeke, two at one time, an houre before supper. Prepare this ly ensuing: Take Aristology, Swines bread, of each half an ounce, of Gentian, Rhapontica, of each three drag. Centory one quarter of an ounce, seeth these things in ly, and wash therewith. Item take Ireos halfe a ounce, Squils one ounce, Centory halfe an ounce, Mirtle seed one ounce, Cloues three quarters of an ounce, bitter Almonds foure ounces, Vineger, as much as is néedfull: let them seeth together stopt well in a glasse in water by a soft fire about the space of foure houres: afterwards wring it out wel, & with this oile annoint the pushes or scabs whence the lice do issue and bréed. A salue. Take Iuniper berries powned well, one ounce, of sallet oile thrée ounces, of white wine one ounce and a halfe: seeth them together til the wine be consumed, afterwards wring it out; then take two ounces of Barrowes greace, Elecampane rootes rosted vnder the ashes, one ounce and a halfe, Litharge of gold one ounce, prepared Quicksiluer one ounce and a half, tem∣per them and annoint the scabs therewith, but beware of the eyelids that you do not annoint them therewith. In this lousie euill is commaunded to mortifie the Quicksiluer as hereafter followeth:How to pre∣pare & mor∣tifie Quick∣siluer. take wild Ferne and the roots thrée M. Limons and Oranges cut in péeces, of each three drag. seeth them in water vntill the third part be consumed: afterwards straine it through a cleane cloth, and temper the quicksiluer wel amongst it. There are other meanes more to kil the quicksiluer, like as hath bene shewed in the other salues for Lice. Of the bad sore, Scurfe or Scall of the head, and such like. §. 10. AS through the vnnaturall moisture of the head Lice do grow: so doth there come thereof bad sores or scals of the head, as is séene in children which are full of moisture. And although these scabs are for the most part alwayes an expul∣sion of nature, whereby children are cléered from other accidents and noisome diseases, for which cause they ought rather to be prouoked then healed: neuer∣thelesse heed must be taken that this breaking out come not to grow old, and to be changed into the bad sore or scall, the which is not to be holpen in people of yeeres, nor yet in yong children, therefore will we here write somewhat thereof. Of a Scald head. THis is a detestable disease, to wit, the sorenesse or scals of the head with scurfe, spoile and falling off of the haire, with much itch, stench, and lothsome mishape or ilfauorednesse: the one sort are drie, the other are moist; neuerthelesse all are to be cured after one maner. At the first doth this bad sore appeare small and little: but if they be not quickly looked vnto, then runneth it forthwith from the one side of the head to the other, vntil the whole head be ful: the causes are drie burnt humors, or moisture and putrified blood. If it come only of Phlegma, then yéeldeth it moisture, whereof we wil make further mention. If it be dry and old, then do all the learned conclude vpon it that it is incurable; and although it should heale in continuance of time, and through much aduise, and with trouble, neuertheles must not one cease therefore. And to this end are these things following acknowledged to be good for the same. First it is needfull to begin the cure with a good order of diet, wherein neuerthelesse there is no certain order to be made, because that this disease is incident to yong children, albeit som∣times also to people in yéeres, wherein great difference is to be made. But generally to eschue all things which maketh heauy, melancholike and flegmatike bloud, whereof are many instru∣ctions
giuen in many places of this booke. First of all, a full growne man must alway apply him∣selfe as hereafter followeth. Aboue all he must beware of strong and sharpe wines, and (as is said) from all melancholike meate, as cheese, coleworts, salt flesh, and such like, and must rather vse them that be light of di∣gestion, and make good blood, as fowles that haunt high grounds, rere egs, Borage, sweet fish of fresh waters. He must also oftentimes purge, according as the person is, and as the sores be great and noisome. If a mans age wil permit it, & the the patient be abounding in blood, which may be perceiued by the greatnesse of the veines, it is aduised to open the head veines in both armes, likewise the veines in the forehead, and behind the eares. Neuerthelesse some do suppose that the two last mentioned veines are not often to be opened. To the end one might recouer haire, for which this blood is requisite, vpon the places where it is red and raised, and sheweth bloody, are horse-leaches and boxing cups to be set, and plaisters to be applied that do raise blisters, whereof shall be more spoken in time. If there be any disease where haire groweth, there must it be shorne off twice a wéeke, and alway before there be laid any salue vpon it, the haire must be cleane shorne away, and be also wel rubbed with course linnen, and afterwards annoint it ouer with the iuice of onions or of radishes. These are now the beginnings of the cure. First of all must the grosse burned moisture be attenuated and prepared for expulsion, the which is to be effected with Oxymel of Squils called Compositum, and is described in the second Chapter, §. 6. for which also doth serue the sirupe of Fumitory. The melancholike and flegma∣tike humors are to be purged with the pils Cochiae; and if one haue strong folks in hand, he may vse thereunto Epithymum, Coloquint, and prepared Hellebore: yet a man is alwayes to be ad∣uised herein by a learned Phisition. And for example in a dry scall: Take prepared black Helle∣bore one drag. Sene leaues, Epithymum, of each one drag. Agaricus one drag. and a half, Mastick one drag. Aloe half an ounce, make pils thereof with the iuce of Smallage, and giue thereof one dragme at one time. But if the scall be moist, then purge with these pils following: Take Cochiae one drag. & a half, Epithymum halfe a drag. make pils thereof for to vse at two times: or take Agaricus, Coloquint, and Mastick of each one drag. Aloe halfe an ounce, temper them all together with the iuice of Garlick take one drag. at once. Mirobalans, Chebuli tempered with Epithymū and Sene leaues are also méet for this. Take of these remedies, of which we shall write against both sorts of these scals, and begin first with the least. Fumitory, after what sort soeuer it be taken, doth much clense the blood, therefore it is to be v∣sed for this disease. Also wash the head with wormwood wine, for that it drieth the moisture, and specially healeth the scals, with the white scall or scurfe. Annoint the scals with oile of white Lillies mixed together with the oile of Cammomill. Take the yolks of egs, fry them well in swines grease, and put vnto it as much Tupentine, let them melt together, they dry very gently. Take oile of Roses, Iuniper oile, of each half an ounce, quick brimstone, Pigeons dung, Ver∣digrease, of each 3. drag. a litle wax, melt them together, it is very certain, and healing all scals. Take stamped Lupins, temper them in vineger with Barrowes grease. Take oile of Bay and Oatmeale, of each a like much, Basil séed, one quarter of either of them, annoint the head, and lay leaues of this herbe vpon it. But it is too mild for the scall, and be∣sides the Basill séed is hurtfull to the head. Take two handfuls of Sage, beate them smal, temper them with salt, hogs grease & vineger: let it séeth well, and annoint therewith the scald head euery other day. Vpon the day betweene both, it is very good to wash the head with the decoction of Mallowes and Dock roots. This salue is certaine, and approoued many times: Take butter which is burnt black, Soote out of the chimney, and salt, of each a like much: stir them both well amongst the butter, vntill the butter be stiffe, and therewith annoint the scals. And if it be not needfull euery day, then about the third day wash the head with a small ley, and do this as often as is néedfull; when the scurfe falleth away, annoint the red place with this salue. Also this remedy following is much in vse: take pure turpentine two ounces, and wash it well with cléere water, fresh butter one ounce washt well, half an ounce of small bruised salt, one Orenge beaten all to péeces and
wroong out hard, the yolkes of thrée new layd egs, oile of Roses halfe an ounce; temper them all together by a small fire. This is a certaine salue, it may be vsed for all itches and scabs. This salue following is excéeding sharpe, and therefore it is not to be vsed but at great néed, and for the most venemous scabs of the head. Take two ounces and a halfe of Barrowes grease, oile of Bay, Wax, powned Frankinsence of each an ounce, salt one quarter of an ounce, Quicksiluer mortified three dragmes: first melt the wax, oile of Bay and grease by a small fire, and put one ounce of the iuice of Plantaine and Fu∣mitory with it, let them boile till the iuices be consumed; then take it from the fire and temper with it the Frankinsence and Quicksiluer, and stir it so long vntil you sée no more Quicksiluer; it is then prepared: and you are to annoint this salue onely vpon the scall, and if you mixe halfe an ounce of Mastix with it, it would make it the better. Some haue another manner to heale the scall of the head, and do first thus: first they cause the head to be shauen bald, afterwards they annoint it the space of three daies with oile of nuts, oile of Palma Christi seeds, and oile of Cammomill tempered together. The fourth day do they let the head to be pricked in diuers places, that it may bléed: after∣wards they let it be washed with the decoction of Fumitory, Dock roots, and of Cammomill; and afterwards they put into the same decoction Argall Squils, or Garlick; they seeth it all toge∣ther, and forthwith do rub the head therwith, and dry it with hot clothes: and this do they twice or thrice a day for the space of thrée dayes. The fourth day they wash it againe with the former decoction, and then shaue off al the haire: if the skin be not yet cleane, vse rubbing again with the Argal, & continue it so long vntil the skin be through clean, then annoint the head with the salue following. If you haue a woman to cure, then take a womans haire; if you haue a man, then take a mans haire, burne it in a pot of ashes, take thereof an ounce, burnt hazle nuts one ounce and a halfe, the dregs of sallet oile foure ounces, clarified hony thrée ounces, Myrrhe one ounce and a halfe, Aloe halfe an ounce, Saffron thrée dragmes; temper them together vnto a salue. This preserueth the skin, and permitteth not the moisture to putrifie vnder it, but maketh the haire to grow. But if it happen that through this or any other salues the skin is distempered, then must it be vsed no further, but with these decoctions following (which are much commen∣ded) it is to be washed, to wit, with the decoction of Willow leaues and Woodbind, for which these also are more requisite, Blites, Fumitory, wild Time Dock roots, Sorell, Storks bill, all together, or which one can get, decocted or bathed therewith. This following is a very good salue, not only for the scals of the head, but also for al other scabs and scurfs, itch, falling off of the haire, nits and lice. Take Gals, red Arsnick, Aristology, of each 3. drag. Hemlock séeds one quarter of an ounce, foot of a chimny, brimstone, bitter Almonds, Coloquint, Caper roots, fig leaues, Elmtree leaues, Verdigrease, Plume Allume, Sieff memithae plaine Coegal, Myrrhe, Aloe, frankinsence and pitch of each one drag. and a halfe, stampe all that is to be stamped, and temper it with vineger, set it eight dayes or more in the sunne vntill it be well tempered, and then vse it. In like manner is this highly commended, although the scall had continued many yeares. The black and white Hellebore, Brimstone viue, Vitrioll, Gold litharge, vnslekt Lime, Shoo∣makers blacking, Aloe, Gals, soot of the chimny, Woad ashes, of each halfe an ounce, mortified Quicksiluer, Verdigrease, of each one quarter of an ounce, stamp all that is to be stamped. Fur∣ther, take the iuice of Borage, Scabiose, Fumitory, Dock roots, of each two ounces, mixe them all together with three ounces of old dregs of sallet oile and as much vineger: let this seeth vpon a mild fire half an hower, and then temper the other things amongst it, and put an ounce of mol∣ten Turpentine amongst it, Wax as much as is néedful for to make a salue. This is maruellous much commended for all scurfe and diseases of the skin. A sharp ley. The ancient Phisitions wil make a cleane head with sharp ley: but I cannot ad∣uise, especially if one will often vse the same. Take a pound of Argall beaten small, and bind it in a cloth, powre thereon a pint of water, and let it lie so the space of halfe an houre; afterwards lay cloth and all in the fire, and so burne it thrée houres long, then beate it againe, and bind it vp as before, and burne it two houres more, beate it to powder and put it in an Hippocras bag, poure the foresaid water vpon it, let it runne through sixe or eight times, and make a ley thereof: it drieth vehemently, and hath almost the sharpnesse of blew Tartary.
Of the plucking away of the scall. MAke nine caps of blew cloth or blew linnen, as big as the head is scallie, annoint it in∣wardly with molten pitch and rosin, and put it vpon the shauen head, and so leaue it thereon thrée dayes: afterwards plucke it off by force, and it will take away with it the haire and all the scurfe. But if there remaine any haires in it, then plucke them out with small mullets, and then wash the head with water (like as is said) wherein is decocted Fumitorie and Docke rootes, &c. And when it is drie, then set another cappe vpon it: do as before, and so vntill nine times, afterwards vse one of the foresaid salues. Of the skinne of the head. §. 11. FOrasmuch as the foresaid scall hangeth most on the skin of the head, and the fore∣said skin is not onely fastned to the head, but also to the whole body, couering it as with a clothing, and is layd vnder the haire as his ground: therefore are we somewhat admonished here, and afterwards occasioned once againe to write thereof in the first part. The skinne which couereth the head, is not of one kind of nature: for this whence the haire groweth is hard, drie and thicke: the skinne of the forehead, as much as it is without haire, hath her frée motion: that which is vnder the eye cannot be separated but with great trouble, and hath no motion, like that of the forehead. The skinne of the lippes is a mixture of the skinne of the muscles, so that they may be called with both the names. Thus much may suffice at this present time. The fourth Chapter. Of the Scull of the head. BY this name we will not onely haue Cranium, but also all the vppermost bones of the head to be vnderstood, whereof there be seuen commonly told, the which through fiue Suturas, which is sewings or conioining, very naturally are in each other knit together. But for the same one may looke into the Anatomicos: concerning this our purpose, the head is parted into sixe parts, whereof the first is Frons, the forehead, which is begin∣ning from the eye-browes till there where the haire beginneth on both sides euen vnto the eares, it is but one proper bone called by the Chirur∣gians and other mo Coronalis, like as men do vse to weare on this place of the head the garland. The second is fast by it couered with haire, they call it Sinciput, it is with vs the former part, and hath two bones which we call Parietalia, the side bones: they touch both of them the future that passeth ouer the middle of the head, are thicke bored through with small holes and weake. The third do they call Occiput, the hinder part of the head, the necke is a great strong bone with a great hole, where the first ioynt Vertebra of the backbone hath his winding about. The fourth is Vertex, the crowne, the height and middle, from which, as from a point or circle, the haire doth spread abrode it selfe round about, but that which is betwéene both the eares and eyes be called Tempora, with vs the temples. Lastly, is all that beginneth vnder the forehead and the eye-browes vnto the end of the chin, as eyes, eares, nose, mouth, called Facies, that is, the face. These are now the outward parts of the head, which do also comprehend the bones, of which hereafter particularly mention shall be made. As much as then concerneth the scull, that is outwardly after diuers manner of meanes bru∣sed and perished, as through stripes, fractures, wounds, and such like, which accidents do speci∣ally appertaine vnto Chirurgions, neuerthelesse we are minded to discourse somewhat thereof. And this for a beginning.
Of the compression of the skull in yong children. §. 1. IT commeth to passe otherwhiles that new borne children haue their skuls doubled one ouer another or compressed; for which lay this plaister vpon it: Take Lodestone, Pumice stone, salt, of each a like much, bruised small, and make with honie a plaister thereof. Of the fracture of the skull. §. 2. WHen it is time after the first dressing to looke to the wound of the head, then take off the tow, couer the wound with a fine linnen cloth made wet in this Aqua vitae following: Take Aqua vitae made onely of Wine one ounce, wherein put powned Aloe and Myrrhe of each one dragme, Masticke halfe a dragme, stop it fast; then strew of the powder which is powned together of the thrée things vpon the wet cloth, couer it with another cloth, and annoint the wound round about with oile of roses, couer the head gently with a linnen cap or kercher. Item take womans milke that giueth sucke to a boy, wet a péece of silk therein and couer the wound therewith, afterwards take the well brayed white of an eg, put powned Frankinsence vnto it, spread it on a cloth and lay it ouer the wound aboue vpon the first cloth which is made wet in the womans milke, and let it lie so thrée dayes: if the braines be quiet, then is it a good signe of life: afterwards dresse him with the blacke plaister or salue that shall hereafter follow: but if the wound stanch not bléeding, then is this powder following maruellous good; Take Frankinsence two dragmes, Aloe one dragme, and therewith strew the bleeding wound. A water. Take Rosemary with the flowers, Sage, Betonie, of each one M. steepe them 24. houres in good wine and distill it, put thereto Myrrhe halfe an ounce, Aloe one ounce, Saffron ten graines, Sarcocolla, Frankinsence of each one drag. This you are to kéep in a fast closed glasse vntill you haue néed to vse it. After that the wound is dressed, and that it hath not bled much, some do aduise that the head veine is to be opened, and that is very truly aduised, that for all such wounds the head veine once at the least should be opened, and the patient purged: for it happeneth oftentimes that the paine of the head, impostumation, or other mischances may thereby be hindered and preuented. But to returne againe to the Chirurgery. It hapneth oftentimes that there befalleth with it paine of the throte and of the almonds, for which is méete this gargarisme. Take Masticke, Frankinsence, of each one drag. Plantaine, the iuice of Sloes, Acorne cups, of each one quarter of an ounce, Licorice an ounce, Pieretrum, Pomegranate pils, of each one quarter of an ounce: séeth them together in a quart of sower red wine vntil the third part be sod∣den away, put thereto prepared Bolus Armenus half an ounce, burnt Allume one ounce & a half. Lay this plaister following then vpon it to heale it withall: Take oyle of Roses eight ounces, oile of Masticke one ounce, sheepes and calues sewet of each twelue ounces, siluer litharge brui∣sed small two ounces, red lead one ounce, and a pint of wine; then let this boile softly vntill it be browne or blacke: then put thereto foure ounces of Turpentine, Masticke two ounces, Gummi Elenij halfe an ounce, white waxe as much as is néedful for to make a plaister. This plaister is especial good to cure a wound in the head, although one vsed nought else, yet is the wound often∣times to be washed with warme water: and if it were wholy impostumated, then in stead of water vse wine, wherein Mirtle séeds and blossomes of Pomegranates with a little Allume hath decocted. Another plaister, which is also commended for good, and to haue bin approued. Take Gummi Elenij one ounce and a halfe, white rosin two ounces, Waxe two or three ounces, oile of Roses two ounces and a halfe, Ammoniack one ounce, Turpentine one ounce and a halfe, make a plai∣ster or salue of it: some adde Rie meale vnto it: others blacke Beane meale: the third sort beate Plantaine séeds: some also vse wine in stead of oile. A salue. Take white rosin fiue dragmes, powned Aloe halfe an ounce,An especiall salue for the fracture of the skull. oile of Roses and waxe as much as is néedfull, let it melt by a mild fire: when it is cold, put thereto halfe an ounce of Gummi Elenij: with boiling may be made a tough plaister thereof. It draweth the matter out of the broken skull, and from the bottome or depth asswageth the paine.
Yet one more that is stronger; Take the vpright Balsame, or in stead thereof oile of Cloues, Bdellium, Ammoniacum, of each thrée ounces, white rosin, Gummi Elenij, of each one ounce, Frankinsence, Myrrhe, Sarcocolla, beaten small, of each one dragme and a halfe, oile of roses two ounces, waxe as much as is néedfull: make a tough salue thereof, and séeth it in foure oun∣ces of the iuice of Woodbinde vntill all the iuice be consumed. Of the skins or tunicles of the braines, called Dura and Pia mater, when they be perished. §. 3. THese two skins or tunicles that couer the braines vnder the skul, do the Gréeks call Meninges, the vpmost is called Dura mater, the hard Mother, for that in com∣parison of the other it is very hard and full of holes where the veines passe tho∣rough. Pia mater, the good Mother, is very spare and thinne, therefore also very dangerous if the same be wounded: for which these salues following are ordai∣ned and found requisite. Take Woodbind, Betonie, Pimpernell, of each two M. Gummi Elenij, Dragon blood, of each three quarters of an ounce; seeth them together in two ounces of oile of roses, and sufficient quan∣titie of red wine vntil all the moisture be consumed, wring it out, and let it be cold, make it as thicke as you will with molten waxe. Or take Turpentine, Rosin, Wax, of each one ounce, Frankinsence one quarter of an ounce, oile of Roses thrée ounces, Cummi Elenij three dragm. Mastix one quarter of an ounce, Betonie, Wood bind, of each three drag. These herbes must be sodden in red wine vntill all the moisture be sod away, afterwards wring it out, temper the other things with it, stirre it wel about vntil it be a salue. But if the skull onely be broken, whether it be by falling, throwing or beating, and a swel∣ling withall, then take Wormewood, Roses, Cammomill, of each one M. séeth them in red wine and oile of roses as much as is needfull, temper a good quantitie of Beane meale with it, and so applie it. Item, take Wormewood, Cammomill, Melilot, of each one ounce, Stechas, Betonie, Woodbind, Bolus, Dragons blood, of each halfe an ounce, Barley meale two ounces, oyle of roses as much as will suffice for a plaister or salue, yet if you would haue it hard, adde waxe vnto it. The triall when the plaister is sodden inough. §. 4. IF any will put iuices, wine or any other moisture in plaisters, then are you to let the iuice be sod away: and when they be sufficiently sodden, you shall know it hereby: let a drop or twaine fall vpon the fire, if it do not sisse as water is wont to do, then it is inough. The fift Chapter. The face a part of the head. IT is before declared in the beginning of the fourth Chapter, that in diui∣ding of the head, the face is the sixt part, beginning and ending from the eyebrowes vnto the end of the chin, of which parts disease we will now discourse. As much as concerneth the face in generall, man hath purchased the same aboue all liuing creatures, for it cannot be said of any beast that it hath a face, Faciem, but only of mankind: and it is also to be wondred at, that nature hath planted so many parts in so small a compasse; for that there be eyes that sée and leade the whole bodie; a mouth that speaketh and taketh in meate for the sustenance of the whole bodie; a nose that smelleth, and can discerne what is pleasant or vn∣pleasant in smell or sauour, that also doth discharge and vnburden the braines of all superfluous
moisture; eares for to heare, whereby men may vnderstand one another; a beard for to distin∣guish one man from another; eyebrowes to the garnishing and defence of the eies. cheekes, wherewith to manifest and shew shamefastnesse, feare, peace, and friendship, as shall be more at large shewed hereafter: consequently, the face is a looking glasse of the mind, of the inward intention and vnreuealed thought. But we wil not make long discourse thereof at this present, but onely to discourse of the diseases of the face, and how to cure them. Of all staines or spots of the face. §. 1. FOr to take away this disorder or misfiguring of the face, may these remedies fol∣lowing be vsed: make a little cruse of dow, as it were a small pastie meetly thicke, put therein sixe ounces of Cerusse, make it fast on the top, that there flie no vapor out of it; let it stand so in an ouen the space of an houre, that it be not too hote: and when it is waxen cold, take it out and bruise it small, and put thereto a sufficient quantitie of Elderne water, and so set it in the Sunne close stopped; stir it euery day about foure or fiue times, wash the face therewith foureteene dayes long, or as long as is needfull with a cloth which is wet therein. This is oftentimes approued. Item take fresh roots of Salomons seale, beate and annoint it on the spots: or take Goates milke wherein Salomons seale roots are decocted, and vse it as is aforesaid. The water of distil∣led honie doth take them also away. Maidens milke, Lac virginis, the which the ancient Phisitions do so name,Lac virginis or maidens milke. is a good and sure water, not onely for staines in the face, but also for many other diseases, as shall be hereafter more at large declared, and the same shal be prepared thus: take half a pound of litharge of gold, beate it small, and put it into a pot, poure halfe a pint of vineger vpon it, let it séeth a litle, after∣wards when it is setled poure of the cléere into another glasse and kéepe it; you may preserue the litharge for to make a plaister with it afterwards. Secondly, take a good handfull of salt, put foure ounces of water vpon it, séeth it to the halfe, and kéepe it also in a glasse by it selfe: whensoeuer you will vse it, then take three parts of salt water, and one part of the foresaid vineger, temper it well, then will it be as milke: will you haue this better, then put a little Rose water and Sal Armoniack vnto it. It is good for all scurfes: some do vse it in the eyes also, but it is very sharpe, chiefly if one take Sal Armoniack with it. Tristrams water. TAke twelue ounces of Nutmegs, Mace, Ginger, Graines, Cloues, of each halfe an ounce, Rubarb one ounce, Beuer cod, Spikenard, of each halfe an ounce, oile of Bay two ounces, leaue the spices vnbeaten, poure to it foure quarts of wine, couer it close, and let it stand so the space of foure wéekes, afterwards poure away the wine, powne all the spices to pay, and put it againe to the foresaid wine, let it stand well stopt thrée dayes, stirre it well about: then distil it in hot water without séething, and preserue it well. Besides that this water doth take away all spots of the face and of the bodie, there is ascribed more vnto it these wonderful vertues, to wit, some holden in the mouth taketh away the toothach. Also venison laid therein should continue good a yeare and a day. Also al ma∣ner of fruites and flowers laid therein do the like: a litle thereof put into faint wine, maketh the same fresh and quicke: a little drunke thereof doth breake all inward impostumes, it kéepeth a man in good constitution, also the stomacke, the liuer, the milt, the lights and the bowels; a cloth dipped therein put on wounds doth heale the same: it preserueth from al dead palsies, it drieth al moist and rheumaticke braines: if any drinke the same, or annoint the head therewith, it taketh away a stinking breath: also it kéepeth one long youthfull if one drinke a litle of it in the mor∣ning, as many times hath bene proued. A salue for the spots: Take oile of Roses, vnguent of Roses, of each halfe an ounce, oyle of Violets one quarter of an ounce, the iuice of Plantaine halfe an ounce, Muscilage of Fleawort, of Mallowes, of Violet leaues, of each one ounce and a halfe: let it séeth till the Muscilage be con∣sumed, afterwards with molten waxe make a salue thereof.
For the freckles which one getteth by the heate of the Sunne: Take a little Allume beaten small, temper amongst it a well brayed white of an eg, put it on a mild fire, stirring it alwayes about that it waxe not hard; and when it casteth vp the scum then it is inough, wherewith an∣noint the freckles the space of thrée dayes: if you will defend your selfe that you get no freckles on the face, then annoint your face with the whites of egs. Of the rednesse of the face. §. 2. TAke the whites of two egges brayed well with Rose water, temper the iuice of Plantaine and of Docks amongst it, of each a like much, afterwards thrée graines of small powdered Sublimate also mixed amongest it, annoint the rednesse with it. Afterwards take about eight ounces of vineger and rose water, temper one quarter of an ounce of Brimstone amongst it, Allume one quarter of an ounce, let it séeth softly vntill about one third part be sodden away, wash therewith the red face. It is also good that the bad blood may be drawne out to set a horsleach or twaine to it, for it is found that the rednes of the face and the pushes can neuer be better taken away, than with this fastning of the leaches, but one must alwayes purge beforehand. A water. Take Sulfure viue half an ounce, salt one drag. Camfere half a scruple, rose water, the water of blew Flowerdeluce, of each two ounces; set it fourtéene dayes wel stopt in the sun, stir it oftentimes together, make a cloth wet in it, and therewith wash the face. Another. Take one ounce of Ceruise, Masticke one quarter of an ounce, Myrrhe halfe a drag. let them be sifted through a lawne searce together, put them into a mortar, and poure thorough a little sallet oile and vineger, and with long stirring it about make a salue thereof. For all white pushes of the face. §. 3. FOr this is first of all good, the water of broken Ceruise with Elderne water, which is described in the first §. This salue may be also vsed for it. Take shéepes sewet, fresh marrow out of the stags bones, melt them together on the fire, and annoint the face therewith. Item take Camfere halfe a drag. grind it small with three ounces of rose water, stir it often, and wash the face therewith. For this is also highly commended, the oile of Spike, besides the good sauor, it giueth the face a good colour. With the white pushes of the face, we do also vnderstand all scabs, blisters, and other spices of leprosie in the face,Montaga. which the Grecians do call Lchenas, and the Latinists Montagram for that all such diseases do commonly appeare with drie white scabs, and itching scurfe about the chin, the which doth at length spred it self from thence ouer the whole body; for which these remedies following are very good. The Goates milke that commeth warme from the beast, the water of Liriconfansie, of each eight ounces, the whites of three new laid egs which come warme from the neast, the crusts of two warme white loaues, Salomons seale one M. Camfere halfe a drag. This shall be distilled together in séething water, then temper the Camfere amongst it, and wash oftentimes the face therewith. The face commeth also otherwhiles full of little red blisters, whence issueth a sharp moisture mixt with blood, the which if it be not remedied in time, it will degenerate into the right leprie, against which these meanes following are to be vsed. Take water distilled of water-snegs or of muscles thrée ounces, Ceruise washed with Harts toong water, one ounce and a halfe, the iuice of wild cucumbers or the water thereof as much as is needfull for to make a salue thereof: but this following is more forcible. Take Sarcocolla, Ceruise, Starch that is stéeped foure dayes in ly, of each thrée ounces, al these are you to temper with the white of an egge: Lastly, put thereto two graines of Muscus, and one dragme and a halfe of Camfere, make a salue thereof, and therewith annoint the face.
But this following is aboue all other to be commended: Take Litharge of gold which is well decocted in vineger and well cleansed, bruse it very small, and temper with it oyle of roses: but amongst all the rest this is to be noted for a rule, that the vse of this foresaid nointing is not to be done but onely at the euening. For to make a cleane face. §. 4. IF any one haue a dark and sad countenance, he is to be purged with Hiera piera, afterwards he must euery morning fasting take Gentian, Wormewood, bitter Almonds, of each one drag. beaten small together with thrée ounces of Worm∣wood water certaine dayes together: he is to wash the face oftentimes with vi∣neger tempered with Rose water. This following is also very sure: Take Li∣tharge of siluer an ounce and a halfe, Sulfure viue halfe an ounce, Camfere half a drag. burnt Allume half an ounce, make a fine powder thereof; put thereto the water of Lillies and of Liriconfansie, of Beane blossoms, Salomons seale, of each one ounce and a halfe, keepe it in a close stopt glasse, and when you will vse it stirre it well about. Item take Beanes as many as you will, steepe them all a night in sharp vineger, take off the péeles, & drie them in a warme place; beate them to powder, and put some of it in warme water when you will go to bed, and wash thy face therewith. It is counselled for women, that if they wil haue a wel colored face, to eate oftentimes course Marierom: for this it is also good to drinke wine, for it maintaineth a liuely colour. In like maner are much commended for this purpose the Aromaticall wines, that haue rose∣mary in them, not onely to be drunken, but to wash the face also with them. Betonie infused a whole night in wine maketh a good colour. For congealed bloud after any blowes remaining. §. 5. TAke Comfrey, daisie leaues, of each thrée ounces; Cammomil, Melilot, of each one ounce; Beane meale two ounces; boile them together and beate it to grout, & when you wil vse it adde oile of Roses to it. Item this following is very good: take Com∣frey, Daisie leaues of each thrée ounces, Cammomill, Melilot, of each two ounces, Saffron one drag. Beane meale foure ounces, fresh butter two ounces, Fenegréek meale one ounce and a halfe, boile the rootes in water, beate them and make a plaister of it: this is very good for bruised members with congealed blood, it suppleth and swageth the paine, put also Wormewood and Comin vnto it, of each one ounce, then hath it not his like. How to make a good colour. §. 6. TAke the roots of Cuccowpint, Ceruse, of each half an ounce, beaten small, mixe them with Rose water and annoint the chéekes with it: or take the lesser thrée leafed grasse beaten, rub the face therewith; it maketh a faire face and a cléere skin: It is also ascribed to the Mi∣thridate that it should also beautifie the face, but yong hot folkes are not to vse it. The sixt Chapter. Eyebrowes, Eyelids, with all that appertaineth vnto them. IN the beginning of the description of the face in the fift chapter is shewed that the same hath his entrance at the eyebrowes; therefore doth the di∣uision of mans body require somewhat to be written of the same. This is here specially to be noted, that prouident nature doth wonder∣fully defend the eyes, not onely with these, but also with other members mo, from many kinds of externall accidents: for first there be Cilia, the haire of the lids placed on the edges of the vppermost and vndermost ey∣lids, which stand out before with hard and stiffe haires, whereby all smal
things, as flies, dust, and such like, that might fall into the eyes, should be therewith withstood. Afterwards are both the eyelids Palpebrae, whereof the vndermost standeth very fast, and the vp∣permost most swiftly moueth, so that it couereth the eye against all that might fall into it: they do thus preserue and keepe the eyes in the sléepe, they couer them from the ayrie light, to the end that the whole body might the more commodiously take rest. Thirdly, they haue aboue in the end of the forehead as is said, Supercilia, eyebrowes set vpon a high bulke garnished with much haire, to the end that all things that might fal downe, and specially the sweate, which tho∣rough his salt nature might do the eyes much harme, should be kept of these as it were with a bulwarke or fortresse. And in like sort haue both the chéekes also two bunches in the midst of the two sides separated & defended with the height of the nose, like as also the outsides, both of them with hard bones preserued and prouided for, called of the Anatomists Ingales, the temples: so that the eyes are on euery side fortified that they might lie the surer in the depth. It is not néedful to speake more ampler thereof, but onely to discourse of those things which are conuenient for the healing of the maladies that are incident to those members. Of the swelling of the eyelid. §. 1. THere do fall many maladies into the eylids, as swellings, impostumes, blerednes, and other mo, which maladies also oftentimes with the falling away of the haire are augmented. But we wil begin with the swelling, these haue many causes, first that the defluction of the eielids cometh of a grosse and tough humor, their rednes, itch and smart make manifest, whereby they be exulcerated, and the haire falling away by no meanes groweth againe as long as this disease endureth, the which doth hurt the sight and the eyes. This patient first of all if he be full of blood, is to haue a veine opened, afterwards to prepare the matter with Oxymel compositum and sirupe of Fumitory, and afterwards to purge with these pils following, Take yellow Mirobalan barkes halfe an ounce, Aloe one quarter of an ounce, Turbith one drag. Dragagant, Roses, Diagridiō, Sene, the iuice of Fumitory, temper them all together, and giue thereof one dragme at once or foure scruples. They do purge the burnt matter and salt flegme: water baths are also very profitable for this, wherein Mallowes, Sorrell Docks and Verueins are decocted, vsed oftentimes. At night lay this plaister following thereon, take Endiue, Purslaine, Priests crowne, of each a like much, beate them to pappe, and temper them with the white of an egge, and with a little oile of Roses: you may also wet a cloth in the iuice of those herbes, and so lay it thereon. Item take sodden Lentils, powre out the broth, bray them with a little Rose water, and lay it thereon like as the former. Or take Lentils, Pomegranate pils, Roses, Sumack, of each one ounce; beate these together, and make a pap thereof with Rose water: make the eyes often moist with stilled Rose water, or well water wherein Sorrell is decocted. Or do thus: Take Dandelion, Sorrell, Roses, Docke leaues and Lentils, of each a like much. Item, take prepared Sarcocolla, and bruise it in the iuice of Celendine, and annoint the eies therewith, is very good. The order of diet is like, as hereafter in Ophthalmia shall be shewed. But if this defluxion or rednesse of the eylids be of long continuance, then must one let blood, and purge the oftener, and outwardly vse the stronger things, as this ensuing, called Sieff viride: Take Verdigrease one drag. burnt Vitrioll one quarter of an ounce, Orpiment, Seafome, Saltpeter, of each one scrup. Sal Armoniac two scrup. temper them together with the iuice of Rue, and annoint it vpon the eylids. This is very good indeed to expell all such diseases: but it is very strong, and somewhat perilous to be vsed in the eyes, yet outwardly not a whit. This following is somewhat milder: Take Verdigrease one dragme, Dragagant thrée drag. Saffron and Pepper of each one drag. make it as thicke as hony with sowre wine, and vse it as before. Item, take white Wine, Rose water, of each two ounces, Aloe, Saffron, of each one dragme, wherewith wash the eyelids, take water wherein Sumacke is decocted, Rose water and white Wine, of each thrée ounces, Vitrioll, Verdigrease, and burnt Aloe, of each one drag. wash it cold therewith: or take Roses one quarter of an ounce, prepared Tutia thrée drag. Antimony, burnt Copper, of each halfe a drag. Wine six ounces, Fennel water one ounce and a half: temper them and wash the eyes therewith.
The other manner of swelling or distension of the eyelids and browes, doth come of subtile moisture or vapors. Also if there be something throwne into the eye, stung of wasps, or perished through any other inconueniences. In like manner if one rub the eyes with any strong herbes, as Nettles, Rue, Esula, &c. Also these accidents may procéed of a bad digesture of the stomack, of ouermuch watching or sléeping, like as it commeth to passe in the Lithargy, and also in the Dropsie. Item, if the swelling be caused through stripes or hurt, then take the white of an eg brayed, temper it with Rose water, or oile of Roses, and lay vpon it as often as it is dry: two or three dayes after put Cammomill in a little bag, and let it seeth in Wine, and wet the swolne eyes therewith. Item, if this swelling be caused through wind or vapors, then take powned Millet & Cumin, of each a like much, make a plaister thereof with fennell water, and lay a rosted apple vpon it. You may annoint it also with the iuice of Sloes. But if the swelling do come through the stinging of Waspes or Bees, then take Theriaca, Mithridate, or the confection of Triphera, tempered with a litle Aloe, bruised with Rose water, and annoint it therewith. Some do temper salt Gemme amongst it: You may reade further thereof afterwards in the seuenth part, of the stinging of Bees. Or if this swelling be caused through rubbing of hot hearbs or such like, annoint it with Po∣pulcon, oyle of Roses tempered with the white of an egge: for this also the iuice of Housleeke tempered with oyle of Roses, or with iuice of Plantaine, making clothes wet therein, is good. If it be caused by much watching, then is sléepe requisite: and also for a bad digesture, to suffer hunger and thirst, &c. If the same be caused through cold, then take Asarabacca Daffodil, of each halfe an ounce, prepared Tutia, and annoint the swelling therewithall: there may also oyle of roses and white waxe be molten amongst it, that it may be like a salue. The third sort of swel∣ling of these members, is like as it were a fatnesse that sheweth it selfe throughout the browes, where the same aggrauateth and hindreth the lids that one cannot well open them. This di∣stension is without paine, and if one presse his finger vpon it, then is the mark séene stand a good while afterward therein. The occasion of this is dry or grosse slime, and withall some moisture of the eyes, it doth matter in the corners of the eyes, that sticketh so fast to the eyelids. But one must first try to remedy it by fomentation, & to take for it the decoction of Wormwood, Cammo∣mill, fennell, Annise, and such like: afterwards make a plaister of prepared Ammoniack or Di∣achylon, and some salt Armoniack and Ireos tempered amongst it: and if it wil not away there∣with, then is it certaine that it procéedeth not of moisture or vapors but of rottennesse; for which many strong things are to be vsed, for that will not easily be consumed, euen as you may appa∣rantly perceiue, if you let water and fat seeth together, that the water is much sooner wasted than the fat: therfore we are also to vse the things following that are rehearsed hereafter in the first place of this distension. Especially if the premisses will not help, he is to purge, like as is said in the first swelling or distension of the eyelids: but if so be that the water be subtile and fluxible with choler, then is a purgation to be tempered with yellow Mirobalans and Woodbind water, and also to let blood if it be needfull. Warme clothes wet with well water are also very good layd thereon: also to bathe otherwhiles. And when one goeth to bed to lay vpon it the white of an egge brayed well. In the morning are the eyes to be fomented againe with warme water: if then the matter be grosse, and the swelling be any thing big, then take Fenegreeke and Linseed, lay them to steepe in womans milke, then wring out the muscilage, but foment the eyes with warme water before, and lay the foresayd Muscilage vpon it; if there be then paine with it, annoint the place with the fat of a hen. This doth also the Muscilage of Linséeds alone, tem∣pered with a little Waxe and oile of Roses and layd thereon. This tough matter we must seeke to consume with the foresaid Collyrium of Tutia, Pepper, and such like, and therewith continue somewhat, because health cannot follow so soone after it. There cometh also other whiles paine of the eyelids, which presseth none otherwise than as if one were constrained to hold his eyes shut: for which the Mithridate is very good layd vpon the eyes and the forehead, and held in the mouth. The fourth kind of the swelling is called Hailstones, by reason of their hardnesse, which is not throughout like to the fat swelling, but onely in one place whether it be within or without
the eyelids: for this is first to be sought to mellow it, as shall be hereafter taught. If this cannot be effected, then if it may be come by outwardly, it is to be cut out. The fift kind receiueth her name of the Barly which it resembleth, for it is such a swelling of the eyes that stretcheth him from one corner of the eye to the other, and is greatest in the middle and smallest in the corners, and hath this difference with the aforenamed Hailstones, that they remaine hard throughout, but this not so, vnlesse it were so hardned through long continuance of time. For to cure this, the head veine is first to be opened and purged: afterwards to lay vpon it Opopanacum molten in Cammomill oile. Afterwards a plaister made of prepared Galbanum and Barly meale, of each a like much, prepared with oile of Lillies and layd thereon: for this is also very good, Hens grease warme. The eyes must be often bathed with warme water, wherein Barly and Cammomil is sod, and afterwards annointed with the blood of Pigeons, Turties, or Partridges. Another plaister: Take Galbanum, Ammoniacum, of each halfe an ounce, Boreas one dragme, mixe them together and lay them vpon the eye. Or take Frankinsence and Myrrhe, of each one quarter of an ounce, Landanum halfe an ounce, Boreas, Allume, Waxe, of each one dragme, the dregs of the oile of Lillies as much as is néedfull: melt therein the Laudanum and Waxe, the rest temper and beate amongst it: vse this so long vntill it be all consumed. Of the itch and smarting of the eye∣lids. §. 2. IT is mentioned in the former distension or swellings of the eyelids, that the same cometh with great itching and smarting, whereof we must speake more at large. This happeneth oftentimes in the infusion of the eyes Ophthalmia, through salt and sharpe rheumes, whereof shall be hereafter discoursed, and also of Lice, whereof is before spoken in the third Chapter and eight §. and shall immediatly hereafter follow in the discourse of the browes. Otherwhiles this itch and smart doth procéed of hot bloud, or such like other moisture, and in case then the rubbing and scratching do come to it, then hath the humor the more recourse thither, whence follow scabs and scurfe, not much differing from bran or sawdust, which doth harden and continually smarteth. And although in the former swelling of the eyelids (as is said) there be good remedies declared, meet also for this disease, yet neuertheles it is very needfull to speake somewhat more thereof. If it do come through heate and rednesse, vse for it all that is there rehearsed: if it come of any sharp matter, purge (as before in the first swelling is shewed) once euery moneth. Or purge with the whay of Goates milke, wherein is sodden Epithymum, in the which shall be stéeped and wroong out Mirobalani, Chebuli, thrée dragmes, Annis séeds halfe a dragme; and if this be too much, then prepare these pils following: Take Aloe, Rubarb, of each one drag. Annis seeds halfe a drag. Diagridion two scrup. make pils thereof with the iuice of Fumitory, take thereof one dragme at the vttermost at one time: afterwards open the veines in the corners of the eye, and set boxing cups behind in the necke. Also vse either of these fomentations of the eyes, whereof hath bene spoken in many places of the distension and swel∣ling of the eyelids. Or take yellow Amber one quarter of an ounce, Pomegranate péeles thrée dragmes, temper them with hony, and annoint the eyes with it where the itch is. Or take Sal Armoniack two drag. Aloe halfe an ounce, mixe them together in a brazen morter. But if the itch be not too great after the letting of blood and purging them, onely foment the eyes with warme water, wherein is decocted Mallowes, Docks, and Sorrell, with some Rose water put amongst it: or take white wine thrée ounces, Aloe one quarter of an ounce, annoint the eyes therewith after the fomenting. Item, take Butchers broomeséed, Pursian séeds, Lentils, of each a like much, powne them all together, close it with the white of an egge and oile of Roses: Sarcocolla tempered with the iuice of Celendine is alwayes very good for this purpose.
Of clefts in the eyelids. §. 3. THese clefts and infection of the eyelids are caused of heate, or of a sharpe and salt humor that falleth into the eielids after the purging and letting of blood (whereof is said so oftentimes) Seeth pils and blossoms of Pomegranates very soft, after∣wards stamp them in vineger, and therewith annoint the eylids certaine daies to∣gether; and afterwards temper some Saffron and the yolke of an eg amongst it, and lay it vpon it, for it healeth much, like as doth also the Sieff de Thure, which is approued for all rheumes of the eyes, and to be sought for in the Register. Of Warts vpon the Eylids. §. 4. OF these there be two sorts: the one not very hard and without rankling, which is caused of melancholike humors: the other hard, like to a small Mulbery, standing commonly about the corner of the eyes: both of these must be cut or burnt, and after∣wards things laid vpon it, which hereafter for the cure of the excrescence of the flesh, of the fistula and corners of the eye are dicoursed. But of the warts shall be more amply written hereafter in the fift part. Of the inuersion of the eyelids, where the inward red flesh appeareth outwardly. §. 5. IT happeneth also that through the increase of flesh the eyelids do turne, and the inside doth appeare outwardly. There are two sorts of this: the one when the eyelids being turned about be red and sore, which is a kind of scabbednesse: the other doth couer and hide the whole apple of the eye with red and meetely big veines: both of them are of long continuance, and hard to be healed. Therefore it is aduised that at the very first there be somewhat laid vnto it: and although the cure of this disease haue the same intention with all other forementioned infirmities of the eyes yet neuerthelesse it is required for this disease, that if the party be in health, he must purge with these pils: Take Agaricus, Coloquint, Bdellium, Mastick of each one dragme, Aloe halfe an ounce, Turbith one ounce and one quarter, make pils thereof with the iuice of Betony, whereof you are to giue one drag. at once. Or take Pillulae aureae two scrup. Cochiae one scrup. make pilles thereof, and fast sixe houres vpon it. But if one haue once purged, then is the head veine to be opened betweene the thomb and the forefinger, and in like maner in the forehead, and to set box∣ing cups behind in the necke. Allume boiled in white wine, and washed therewith, is also very good. Afterwards this plaister following shall be laid thereon: Take Fenegréeke meale six oun∣ces, Cammomil, Roses, one ounce of each, red wine as much as is needful for to make a plaister, whereof take as much as you will vse at one time: temper amongst it the whites of two well brayed egs, and say it vpon it. Afterwards you are eight dayes one after another to vse this si∣rupe following: Take sirupe of Roses one ounce, sirupe of Vineger Compositum halfe an ounce, Fennell and Licorice water, of each an ounce: after this must you by and by take the foresaid pils againe; and further then euery fift day once, two houres after supper, the inuerted eyelids are in the day time often to be annointed with the iuice of smallage, and that enduring the space of eight dayes. The next eight dayes afterwards, they are to be made moist softly with the wa∣ter wherein Sal Armoniac is dissolued, and then being annointed with the foresaid iuices, lay this plaister following vpon it: Take the plaister De Muscilaginibus as hereafter it is described, one ounce, of Allume, Vitriol, both burnt, of each one dragme, melt this plaister with old wine, tem∣per the powders amongst it into a tough plaister. After the vse of this plaister and the foresaid water, then vse this powder following: Take Antimony halfe an ounce, prepared Tutia, Orpiment, Bloodstone, Litharge of gold, of each one quarter of an ounce, make a very fine powder of it: this eateth away all the superfluous flesh, healeth the sore eyes, drieth and taketh away the itch. But if it be too strong, then leaue out the Orpiment, and take onely Verdigreace two drag. Tutia thrée drag. Antimony halfe an ounce; but haue care of the apple of the eye. And if this disease waxe old, then it is néedfull that this
scabbednesse be rubbed vntil it bléed, which may most commodiously be effected with fig leaues. The other must be opened with a lancet, with a hot iron, and the paine asswaged with the braied white of an eg. But these are cures of cunning and expert Chirurgians, to whom only the same is to be referred. But this drying powder is not here to be concealed, which is also discouered in other places: Take egshels of very new laid egs, lay them the space of nine dayes in vineger, drie them and make thereof a subtill powder, and strew it vpon the disease. These sick persons shal beware of all meates that fume into the head as of al spices, mustard, strong wine, and eschue especially drunkennes: but let them eate rere egs, Spinage, fennel, Bo∣rage, Parsly, yong flesh, and drinke watered wine. The other maner of inuersion of the eylids hapneth when the vppermost eylid shrinketh vp, or is drawne vp, so that it cannot couer the apple of the eye: we call it the Hares sléepe; it doth sometimes couer but one part. Thirdly when the vppermost of the eyelids cannot reach to the lowermost. But if it come by nature, then is it not possible to be holpen. There commeth also otherwhiles a paine in the eyebrowes, which wringeth sore (as if one were constrained to keepe them alway shut) for which Mithridate is very good being spred vpon the eyes and on the forehead, and likewise some thereof holden in the mouth. Of the Consolidation or growing together of the Eyelids. §. 6. IT happeneth otherwhiles, that after the taking off of the skin, or cutting off of the flesh in the corner of the eies (if it be not wel looked vnto) that the eyelids do grow vnto the apple of the eye, or one fast to another, wherewith the whole eie is couered. For to preuent this, must the eyelids which are not yet growne, be raised vp softly, and the place be annointed with a soft fether with the decoction of fennel and Carraway, then put in some of the white of an egge; do this euery day two or thrée times: now if there remaine any flesh, the fourth day are sharpe Collyria to be vsed, which hereafter are described in the eyelids. Of the neathermost Eyelid which pricketh the Apple of the Eye. §. 7. FUrther, it commeth also to passe, that the Eyelids do alter their naturall course in growing, not growing right but inwards: and because (as hath bene said) next to the Apple of the eye, they are very subtile, not sensible at all, they make the more paine with their pricking: for to amend this, these meanes following are to be vsed. If there be but one or two haires, then take Masticke, Gummi Arabicum, make them some∣what moist, turne the eyelids about and annoint them therewith: if it will not be well there∣with, then are the haires to be pluckt quite out, and you must burne the holes with a glowing needle that it may not grow out againe. Or you may vse this salue following: Take the iuice of the roots of Southernwood, Muscilage of Fleawort, a little vineger and Camfere, annoint the same in the same hole. Item take Opium one grain, Mastick half a scrup. make it soft with a drop of vineger, and annoint the hole therewith. Or take the blood and gal of a Hedgehog, iron drosse, of each like much, make a flat cake like to a Lentill, or fish scale, and lay it on the place where the haire is drawne forth; that swageth the paine within the space of an houre, and will not suffer the haire to grow there any more. Or take the rust of iron, temper it with fasting spettle. In like sort may also be powned Ants egs, and vsed. But amongst all is the plucking out and bur∣ning most surest. If the haires be many that grow inward, then must one cut off the outer edges of the eyelids; so that the roots of the haires be taken away, the which must be done by expert Chirurgions, o∣therwise must the eyelids not be cut ouerthwart at any hand, for that they could not grow to∣gether any more. Plaister de Muscilagini∣bus.A plaister de Muscilaginibus, promised to be described in the fift §. Take Fenegréek, Linséed, Hollihock roots, of each thrée ounces: boile them, and draw out the slime or the Muscilage, be∣sprinkle it besides with a little vineger, afterwards temper 3. ounces of small beaten Litharge
of gold sodden softly with sixe ounces of oile of Sesamum, and put thereto the foresaid slime, and then seeth it to a plaister or salue. For falling off of the Haire in the vndermost eye-lids. §. 8. THe falling off of the haire is of many sortes; whereof heretofore in the imperfecti∣ons of the haire are many things described in the third Chapter, 6. §. and furtherin the description of the beard shal be declared. The cause of the falling off of the haire out of the lower eye-lids, is a sharpe salt matter, which consumeth the humors that should féede the haire, and dryeth away the rootes thereof, that they must fal away, which is oftentimes séene by them that recouer of a sore sicknes. It may also happen in the sore∣nesse and scabs of this place, as hertofore is sufficiently declared. Also experience doth teach vs, that the hairs do fall from the eye-lids of those that leade an vnchast life. Also that the crab lice do grow thereof is sufficiently declared before in the former Chapter, 8. §. But if the cause of all this be a sharpe, salt, smarting matter, let the bodie be purged, like as heretofore is specified for the itch of the eyelids, and so for the like in others. But for a beginning, one must kéepe a good order in eating and drinking; afterwards make this plaister: Take Hares dung, Bucks dung, of each one quarter of an ounce, burnt Hasill nuts thrée drag-goates fat as much as is néedful for a salue, therewith annoint the eyelids. Or take Antimonie, burnt Pepper, of each one drag. and washed Lead halfe an ounce, Indie Spica, Squinant, of each one drag▪ and a halfe, burnt Date stones fiue drag. Goates and Beares fat, as much as is néedfull for a salue. Item take Swallowes dung, Mice dung, of each halfe a drag. burnt Date stones, Lasure stones, of each one drag. Indie Spica one scrup. make a salue thereof with clarified honie, and vse it as the aforesaid. If the falling off of the haire be caused of rednesse, smarting, or scurfe, then take a Pomegra∣nate, cut it in eight péeces, and séeth it in vineger vntill it be soft, and vnto growt or pap: after∣wards straine the iuice thorow a cloth, and vse it so long vntill it be thorow whole. The seuenth Chapter. Of the Eyes. THey are thus described: The eye is an instrument of the sight, whose na∣ture and complexion is moist, round, yet a little flattish, with seuen pan∣nicles and thrée humors complete and conioyned, the definition wherof wold here be too long to rehearse. These two members are accounted in comparison of all the rest to be very small, yet notwithstanding so preci∣ous, that our Lord God hath planted maruellous things, and shewed his power and omnipotencie most excellently in them: wherof it is not here néedfull to write any more, yet it is not amisse to rehearse those thinges which in the beginning of the first Chapter haue bene said of the face: to wit, that for the most part al humane affections, inward desires, and cogitations of the hart, do most forcibly appeare in the eyes. For what is there, that the inward thoughts, will and desires of the heart and the mind could counterfeit more naturally, than these members? For they shew thorow their rol∣ling about, looking downwards, sudden motions, winking, and other such like, mirth, sorrow, anger, hatred, and other affections of the hart. They do giue also sure knowledge of the secret lusts: for there cannot be so many inclinations in the brest of man, but there may be a signe thereof discerned in the eyes: so that one may iustly say, the eyes are most true messengers of the heart and of the mind. Of them haue the Physiognomici knowne the manifold nature of men, and adiudged that the eyes which stand so déepe in the head do sée much sharper, than they that stand wide out. Those eyes that stand farre out (they say) do decipher a foole and light brained person: they say also, that the eyes which do so twinkle and close the eyelids so often, do alwaies signifie fearefull persons: contrariwise, they that hold the eyes strong open, are stout and inuin∣cible,
and such like moe, with which naturall causes the daily experience agréeth. In fine, there is nothing more costly, nor more néedfull in a liuing bodie, then the sight: It is also amongst the motions of the bodie an onely thing, that maketh a difference betwéene life and death. And this is sufficient in generall to be said of the eyes: we will now come to their diseases and their cures. Of the paine in the eyes in generall. §. 1. BEfore that we do come to the effect of the matter, these things are to be obser∣ued in all paines of the eyes: to wit, the nature of the patient, his age, the time of the yeare, the sicknes he hath had before, and all other circumstances: so that all things, according as occasion serueth, may be either augmented, diminished, or altered. In generall, it is alwaies good in all paines of the eyes, that the pa∣tient do kéepe him in a darke place, frée from aire and wind, lie high in the bed, so that the rheume may not tarie in the eyes, but may fall downe to the chéekes: sléepe is very méete: for it consumeth and digesteth the matter. All vexation is also to be eschewed, and all that may bréed or bring any trouble to the head, as sorrow, anger, ill fauor, & such like. Also to refraine much venerie, to féed on light meates, to auoid strong sents, as Mustard, Onions, Gar∣licke, Beanes, nuts, wine, vineger, and all sowre meates. He must kéepe himselfe very quiet, as long as the griefe of the eyes endureth. This is now a generall and briefe declaration, because that we shortly hereafter (in the description of the Gnats that séeme to swarme before the eyes) shall giue a longer and ampler instruction of the eyes. What concerneth the letting of bloud, purging, and other sorts of remedies, that shall particularly be taught in their proper places. First some remedies are here described which may be vsed for all paines of the eyes: and for that this is a generall rule, that as oftentimes, and so long as the paine of the eyes endureth, you shall lay thereon the white of an egge, brayed together with oyle of Roses; for it stayeth the course of the humors, and swageth all paines. Item take the iuice of Celendine and honie, of each a like much, beate them together by a soft fire; afterwards scum them, and annoint the eyes therewith. The iuice of Fennell and the iuice of Betonie is also very good for this purpose. Item take broade Plantaine, Eiebright, Fennell, séeth them together in a pot, and receiue the vapor into the eies. Take a young Pigeon, open the veins vnder the wings, and let the bloud drop in your eyes; but vse not this in the beginning, (for it is too hot) but at the last when the course of the humors beginneth to abate. Or you may vse this following: Take the bloud of a Turtle doue, temper it with Rosewater, and put it into the eyes. This is many times approued for the paine of the eyes. Others do only annoint their eyelids with it. A very good Collyrium, which diminisheth and discusseth the paine. Take prepared Tutia, Camfire bruised very small, of each one scruple, Rosewater one ounce, white Wine halfe an ounce, temper them well: when you will vse it stir it well about, and put a drop or twaine in the eye. The white powder of Rasis for the eyes.Rasis his white powder which maruellously asswageth the paine. Take prepared Sarcocolla fiue drag. Sief memthe (which is hereafter described) one ounce: temper it wel with Fennel wa∣ter, or womans milke. But by reason that womans milke is oftentimes vsed, therefore we will admonish here, that womans milke must not be vsed except it be very fresh: for it sowreth very quickly, and loseth her force, whereby it might do more hurt then good. Sief memitheSief memithe which is here and in other places mentioned, is thus prepared: Take the iuice of the strange herbe Glancium, called by the Arabians Memithe, Chamedrios, barkes of Franken∣sence, Myrrhe, Aloe, Sarcocolla, burnt Vitriol, Aristologi, of each a like much: make this together into a most fine powder, and vse it like as is taught. Of the corners of the Eyes and their diseases. §. 2. FIrst there groweth in the corners of the eyes sometimes as much of the flesh, that the sight thereby is hindered. Contrariwise there commeth also sometimes such drying away or
consumption, that they wholly waxe sore, and alwaies run, so that the rude and vnskilfull peo∣ple do déeme no other, then that it is a Fistula. The cause of this growing is ouermuch bloud and moisture, as it also commeth to passe in the diminishing of the eyelids, the same being not rightly handled, the affluent humors make flesh to grow againe. The diminishing and abating is caused of drowth. The signes of both these are apparant to the sight: they are both almost in∣curable, but that there must be sharpe medicines vsed vnto them which the eyes cannot suffer, wherefore it is strictly to be commaunded to the vulgar Occulists, that they haue speciall care of their incisions and cauterisings in such perilous places. For ease may one vse one of these remedies following, which are very méete for it, if the cor∣ners of the eyes do run much and impostumate. For this, is the bodie first to be cleansed, afterwards to be bathed euery day, and to sweate, but not too much: for yt thereby should the moisture be drawne out of the bodie, & be consumed. Afterward shall this powder be vsed oftentimes, made after the subtilest manner. Take prepared Tutia, one ounce and a quarter, red Corall, yellow Mirobalans, of each one quarter of an ounce, Pepper halfe a drag. strew that in the corners: Or take prepared Tutia one drag. Antimonie halfe a drag. prepared Pearles, Nihil, red Corall, of each one quarter of an ounce, burnt silke houses halfe a drag. make an impalpable powder therof, it drieth very strong∣ly, and is also safe. Or take Aloe, Acatia, Litium, fine Bolus, Gummi Arabicum, of each one drag. This being powdered together, is to be mixed with the white of an egg, or dissolued Draga∣gant: afterwards annoint therewith the forehead and eyelids. Item te the iuice of Housleek, or Nightshade, and veriuice, of each one ounce: mixe beaten Acornes amongst it, Myrrhe, sine Bolus, of each one dragme, lay it on the eyes, as is said before. Item take Cipers nuts, Mommie, Dragon bloud, Masticke, Dragagant, of each one quar∣ter of an ounce, beate them small, and make with the white of an egge, or dissolued Dragagant, a salue of it. Item wash the eyes oftentimes with raine water, wherein Galnuts, Mirtle séedes, fine Bo∣lus, and Cipers nuts haue bene decocted. These things are all good to driue backe the moisture. Or take burnt Mirobalans, Chebuli stones beaten small, make with water of Mints a Colly∣rium of them. Item take one drag. of Tutia stéeped in Mirtle water and▪washed, white Corall, burnt stones of Chebuli, Butchers broome séedes. Gal nuts, Aloe, Mastick, Frankinsence, Opiū, of each one scrup. all beaten together after the smallest manner, make a powder, or temper it in water wherein Gummi Arabicum or Dragagant is dissolued. Now because that in this Collyrium, as also in other mo medicines for the eyes, Opium is vsed:Opium not waies to be vsed for the eye. therefore must I here admonish, that the same is not to be taken but in time of great extremi∣tie: for it might easily happen, that whereas one meant to ease the paine, that the disease for euermore were made altogether incurable, yea that blindnesse might follow after it. Therfore are men to take good héed vnto this. A plaister. Take Laudanum, Ammoniacum, of each one ounce, Mastick fiue dragm. parched Millet two ounces, beate it all smal, make with Cammomill oile a plaister foure fingers broad, and one quarter of a yard long, the which lay vpon the seame of the scull. Hereafter do follow many more remedies, which are also very good for it: but this present is prepared rather for the running corners of the eyes, for to drie them, and to stay the rheume. Of the disease in the eyes called Ophthalmia. §. 3. SOme haue supposed that this Gréeke word did generally signifie the paine in the eyes: but other haue defined it thus, Ophthalmia is an infirmitie that cometh in the eyelids and in the eyes, spreading it selfe so wide abroad, that it couereth the whole apple of ye eye. Or Ophthalmia is a hot disease, wt only assayleth the eyes (after a natu∣rall manner) through bloud or Choler; or outwardly of corrupted matter, of cold Rheumes, or is caused of bloud or vapours, and thereby whatsoeuer moisture is in the eye it is ouerhea∣ted: yet do all learned conclude with Galen, that it is Flegme of the eyes. Of this do also come other moistures, which the Latinists do cal Lippitudinem, that is, the blearnes of the eyes, which is caused of three speciall causes, like as is said at the first, to wit, of outward, and inward: Of outward, as the Sunne, smoke, dust, and such like: so match also the vnnatural alteration of the
times, vse of vaporous meates, as Onions, Garlick, Mustard, strong compounded Wines, cause the same. The inward causes are the affluxe of certaine humours, be they mixt or not: but this infirmitie of the eyes may be caused of the bloud, Cholera, Phlegma, or Melancholia, of which signes we will here somewhat discourse. O bloud.If it proceed of bloud, then are the eies and their veins puffed vp, red, the temples of the head do beate, the vppermost eyelids do swell, the eyes are moist, yet with little paine; but with such moisture that in sleepe the eyes do bake to: for this doth also the time of the yeare auayle, as doth the clearenesse, youth, warme and moist countrie, and meates that engender much bloud. If it do come of Cholera,Choler. then is there pricking, burning, with great paine and swelling, not so red as aforesaid, but moist and burning, that therby also the apple of the eye is otherwhiles pe∣rished. If it proceed of Phlegma,O Plegme. then is there a compression and ponderositie in the eyes, with great paine, without heate or rednesse, but some whitenesse, & by reason of the great moisture, much sorenesse and swelling. Of Melan∣chlieIf it be caused of Melancholia, then is there also great ponderositie, with sallow color, with∣out rednesse or compression: the eyes do not bake together in the sléepe, for that the Catarre or the Rheume is too drie. The Phisitions do herein make more differences and signes, which are to be commended to the Philosophers. But this may suffice for our purpose and intention. Neuerthelesse, this is also to be noted, that these defluxions, sorenesse, or impostumations of the eyes (that befall for the most part in the corners of the eyes with a sharp salt Rheume, which hath bene spoken of in the §. 2.) are the beginning and true signes of this Ophthalmia. The cor∣ners of the eyes are foure, two besides the nose, which are the greatest, the other smaller. When∣soeuer then the Ophthalmia doth appeare in this place, occasioned of bloud; then must it be pre∣uented with letting of bloud, be it in the head veine, or other, in one, or both the armes, and let out much or little according to the abilitie of the patient. And if the matter were subtill and ran sore, one may also let him bloud in the temple of the head. In like manner, horsleaches applyed to the forehead, and boxing cups on the necke. But if all this will not helpe, there is to be made and applyed on the top of the head vpon the Sutura Coronalis a Cauterium, whether it be poten∣tiall or actuall. Afterwards the patient is to be purged, and to vse no other outward meanes but to betake him to a good order of diet. Now to procéede to the especiall infirmities of the eyes or Ophalthmia, this shall be the first. Of the rednesse of the eyes. §. 4. THis is caused outwardly of stripes, thrusts, concourse of blood, superabundance of bloud in the veines, which (as is said) spreadeth it abroad in the eyes. For this, it is aduised to open the head veine on the contrarie side, or at least to set boxing cups vpon the shoulders: afterwards to purge. Further, to apply out∣ward things which driue ye matter back againe. For this is first, the white of an egge brayed with womans milke, most highly commended and safe, a drop or twaine dropped into the eye. Or séeth Linséed and make a spunge wet in that decoction, and lay it warme on the eyes: but if this will not helpe much, then do in like manner with the decoction of Fenegréeke or of Cammomill. Item take the iuice of Nightshade, temper it with the brayed white of an egge, and with oile of Roses, make a cloth wet in it, and lay it on the eye. Item, if the eyes be bloudshot, take the iuice of wormewood, bray it well with the white of an egge, and drop into the eyes. Take Coriander, seeth it in water, wring it out with this decoction, make muscilage of Fleawort, temper it with fine Bolus, and lay it on the eyes with wet clothes. Or make Cotton wet in the brayed whites of egs with oile of Roses, and lay it to his fore∣head, eyes, and temples. Also you may temper amongst it fine Bolus, or Frankinsence, which you will. But if the matter be subtill, then must one labour to discusse the bloud: for which end, you are to take young Pigeons or Turtle doues bloud, like as is taught before in the §. 1. for that hath beene found many times to be good. Item take Frankinsence, Sal gemmae, of each one drag. beate it small, and make it with wo∣mans milke into a Collyrium.
Take broad Plantaine water about one pint, small brused Verdigrease one ounce, fine Bo∣lus, Dragon bloud, of each half an ounce, Camfire one quarter of an ounce: distill this in a glas∣sen helme in seething water: it is not onely good for red eyes, which are painfull,Vlcerations o he priui∣ti▪ and for swolen eyelids that haue long continued: but also to all sore stinking mouthes, and especially for al vl∣cerations of the priuie members. Item take Aloe thrée parts, Camfire one part, stéepe them in Rosewater, and vse it. Radish water is also maruellous good for all rednesse of the eyes. Take the water of Ver∣ueine, of Eyebright, of Marioram, of each halfe an ounce, Fennell water one ounce, Camfire halfe a drag. the gall of a great Pickerell: temper and stir it all together, and vse it as the rest. Item take prepared Tutia, prepared in pisse and Fennell water (like as is taught in the In∣troduction) halfe an ounce, of Mace thrée drag. of Camfire sixe graines, of Malmsey one small pint: beate all these as small as may be, mixe them together, and kéepe it. You haue also other preparations mo of this Tutia, like as there are twaine expressed in the Introduction of this booke: but for the rednesse of the eyes is this especially recommended:Tutia prepa∣red. take halfe an ounce of Tutia, make it glowing, and quench it 15. times in Rosewater: then bruise it small, and put vnto it one quarter of an ounce of Calamint stone, thrée cloues, halfe a pint of Malmsey: mixe all these together. These thrée Collyria are for all rednesse of the eyes and other things very highly commended of the ancient Phisitions. Also to befume the eyes with white Amber, is much praised. Item take Hyssope, Marioram, Fenegréek, Cammomill, Melilot, Roses, & such like: séeth them, & let the vapor go into the eyes. A plaister for the rednesse of the eyes. Take Radish leaues wel made cleane and washed, and Currans of each halfe an ounce, Pigeon dung one quarter of an ounce: beate them well toge∣ther, and lay it thereon. The same may also be done with powned Willow leaues, and laid vpon it. Salues. Take Tutia halfe an ounce, oile of Bay one quarter of an ounce, hony and vineger of each a spoonefull, Camfire one drag. make a salue thereof, and therwith annoint the eielids. This is also méet for inuerted eyelids. Eiesalue called Nihil. Take prepared Tutia one quarter of an ounce, red Corall one dragme, Pearles one drag. Nihil albi one quarter of an ounce, Camfire halfe a scrup. Barrow grease 4. ounces: temper it well annoint of this salue the quantitie of a Coriander séede in the corner of the eye, in the euening when you go to bed: it healeth the rednesse of the eye, and taketh away all rheumes that fall into the eyes. After this forme is the salue of Roses much commended, which is described in the first Chapter and 2. §. whereof take one ounce, prepared Tutia, foure scrup. and annoint the eyelids therewith. Confected Chebuli being eaten do withstand the rednesse of the eyes, and defend the sight. In like manner Nutmegs confected in hony. Hote eyes. §. 5. FOrasmuch then as that there can be no rednesse of the eyes without heate, ther∣fore must we discourse somewhat thereof, and vse these remedies following for it: Take the water of Eyebright, of Fennell, of Celendine, of each one ounce, prepared Tutia thrée scrup. prepared Sarcocolla and pearles, of each halfe a drag. temper it together. This Collyrium is much in vse at Augusta. Another. Take Rue, Fennell, Verueine, of each like much, stampe it, and poure thereon Rosewater and white wine, so that the herbes be couered: let it stand a night, afterwards distill it in a glassed helme and in water. Item take prepared Sarcocolla halfe an ounce, white Dragagant, Frankinsence, Iron drosse, Pearles, of each thrée dragm. Indy Spica, Siluer and gold Litharge, of each one drag. and a halfe, Starch, Ceruise, of each one quarter of an ounce, Tutia, thrée drag. bruise this all together vnto a small powder, make a dough thereof with Rose water, afterwards make small trocisces thereof, and let them drie: powne them afterwards againe, and make them moist with the iuice of Pomegranates, and drie them a∣gaine. Thirdly, make them moist with the water of Nightshade like as before: put thereto one drag. of Camfire, white Sugar one drag. and a halfe. When ye will vse of it, stirre it with Rosewater, white of an egge, and womans milke: Take Aloe, Tutia, Hony, Sugar, Fene∣gréeke,
Fennell, of each a like much, seeth them in Wine, and receiue the vapor, or apply it vn∣to them; it is very good for the hote eyes. Item, take white Wine foure ounces, Aloe, Serapinum, Myrrhe, Sugar, Fennel, of each one drag. let it séeth moderatly: this is also good for a Collyrium. Take the water of Fennell, of Eybright, of Celendine, of each halfe an ounce, Serapinum one drag. dissolue this gum, and temper it all together. Item, take gréene Agrimonie, stampe and temper it with the white of an egge: make towe wet therein, and lay it vpon the eyes. To set boxing cups on both shoulders, is also very commodious for this infirmitie, womans milke, letting of bloud, Roses and Fennell, with Tutia: sodden Fenegréeke and egges sodden warme and layd vpon the eyes is also much commended. Hote Blisters and pricking in the Eyes. THese are caused thorow moysture which setteth it selfe in the white of the apple of the eye, and there rankleth. The blisters are sometimes great, and sometimes small, white, red, darke, and also blacke with paine and pricking, according as the matter is. The déeper, the greater they be, and the more hurtfull and daungerous to be cured, because of the noblenesse and tendernesse of this member. But this in the beginning is alwaies good for it. Take Licium, Saffron, of each halfe a drag. Acatia or the iuice of Sloes one scrup. mixe this with Rosewater, and drop a little in the eyes: he must also be let bloud, and purged. But this foresaid water for the eyes must be dropped into them with the white of an egge, and whilest the disease is in Augmento, or the increase: then take Fenegréeke, Linséed, of each one quarter of an ounce, Melilot one quarter of an ounce; séeth it in faire water, and wash the eyes oftentimes therewith, let a drop thereof drop otherwhiles into the eyes: that ripeneth, draweth out the corruption, and swageth the paine. When as the blister is broken out, then heale it like other sores of the eyes. Item, take the fat of the fish Tymalus, and annoynt it on the apple of the eye: it is very strong, therefore it is better for horses then for men. But this following is more su∣rer: take the crumme of white bread, make it wet in water: but it is stronger in womans milk, and lay it on, where it is drie make it wet againe, or take a fresh. This confection following is very good for all heate of the eyes, swelling, and pricking: take Eyebright, Fennell, Cinnamom, of each thrée drag. long Pepper, Mints, Mace, Marioram, Verueine, Calmus, Rosemarie, of each one drag. and a halfe, Sugar pennets thrée ounces, white Sugar fiue ounces: with the Sugar séeth these iuices following, of Roses, of Verueine, of each two drag. the iuice of Fennell that is well clarified fiue ounces, the iuice of Celendine, of Rue, of each one ounce and a halfe: let them séeth so thicke as a sirupe, afterwards temper amongst it the rest well beaten. Item take young Endiue, stampe and temper it with the oile of Violets, or rather the oile of Roses: annoint therewith the hote corners of the eyes and the eyelids: the same taketh away the paine, and swageth the heate. If that will not helpe; take the meale of Lintels, Sumacke séede, Roses, Pomegranate kernels, powned together and tempered with vine cuicte, vse this as the rest. Item if this helpe not, then must the head veine in the forehead be opened, or in the corners of the eyes, which you will; which doth void away the sharpe matter that setleth in the eyelids. In like manner purge alwaies with such medicines which expell the Cholera, and salt matter. It is also good to bath other whiles, and to sweate moderately, whereby the sharpe daefluxion is delayed: or in stead of sweating may you foment the eyes with a spunge made wet in luke∣warme water. Lastly, it is very good to wash the eyes with water of Fennell, of Celendine, of Verueine, and of Eyebright, mingled together one amongst another. Itch and Scabs of the Eyes. §. 6. THese biting drie scabs of the eyes do otherwhiles manifest themselues on the lids of the eyes, so that one cannot forbeare but to rub them, the which doth the eyes and face great hurt, making the same more hotter and redder.
This defluxion is a salt matter, which is sharpe and pricking. Against this, he must first re∣frame from rubbing of the eyes, eate and drinke soberly, purge choler, open the head veine, and also lay thereon outwardly at the first fresh water or Rosewater two or three daies: afterwards he must foment and wash the eyes with the decoction of Mallowes, Violet leaues, Celendine and Verueine, or with Rosewater also alone. If then of this or any other occasions there come any swelling to it, then looke to that which is ordained for red and hot eyes. Watering or running Eyes. §. 7. IT is manifest, that the mattering of the eyes doth procéede of many occasions, as of mirth, sorrow, weaknesse of the retentiue power, and superfluous moisture of the braines that falleth vpon the eyes; like as of thrusts, stripes, sharpe winds, smoke, cough, sharpe sauors of Onions, Saffron, &c. all the which do perish the eyes, so that the eyes do stand as if the eyelids were newly pluckt off, or that a Cataract had bin couched in them, or as if they had suffered any other disease, the which also happeneth if any body drink too much wine: wherefore that many may afterwards bewaile the miseries of drunkennes, what concerneth the outward causes, those may be learned of the patient himselfe. But if this running of the eyes be caused through any disease of the braines, and not through heate: then doth the patient alwaies feele some heauie puffing vp of the veines in the forehead, and in the temples of the head: and this defluxe is for the most part alwaies augmented by the neesing. This running or watering is very strong, falling as well into the eyes as into the nose, with a sharpnesse in the throate. But if this defluxion be through heate, then is the humor so hote, that through the heate it bites open the eyelids, which cause the haire to fall out of the eyelids, yea that the heate may be perceiued, through féeling with the hands. But if it come through cold, then are all things contrarie to all these that we haue now spoken of. Now the remedies of these running eyes be these. They that be caused of outward causes, may be easily remedied, that is, by taking away of the cause of this defluxion: but as much as doth concerne the inward causes where heate is the cause, it is specially aduised, that the bodie be purged sometimes with Pils Cochiae, Aurea, with Succo Rosarum, or with Pils of the fiue kinds of Mirobalans. And it is not enough that this and the letting of bloud be once performed, but oftentimes: to wit, in the beginning, in the aug∣menting, and in the standing still of the disease, that thereby the sicknesse may be throughly holpen. The order of Diet. FOr this must all drying things be vsed, and all moist attenuating meates and drinkes es∣chewed, like as Lentils, Colewoorts, Lettice, Purslaine, salt fish and flesh, Milke, Chéese, Onions, Scallions, Garlicke, and all that fumeth into the head: some forbid to eate in the euening. When it is caused through heate, he must smell to Roses, Saunders, Camfere, and such cooling things: like as also the Pomanders are commodious for these causes, ordained in the discourse of the Plague. When the patient is purged, and the pain of the eyes be yet in the beginning; then take (like as is is oftentimes aduised at the first) the brayed white of an egge, and drop a drop thereof in the eye. Take also milk of a young woman which hath a daughter sucking vpon her, put it fresh into the eye: or take two ounces of Rosemarie amongst it, then beate the white of an egge, and drop a drop or two thereof in the eye. Some do take onely fresh water mixt with vineger, and vse it as is rehearsed, specially after bathing, and haue thereby found great amendement. This is also much praysed: Take vnripe Grapes, burne the same to ashes, bruse them very small, and blow somewhat thereof into the eyes; it dryeth the running, and doth driue away the rednesse. Or take the slime of Fleawoort, Quince kernels, or Dragagant one quarter of an ounce, the white of an egge well brayed, womans milk that hath a daughter sucking, half a drag. tempered well; if the paine be very great, then draw out the slimes or muscilage with water, wherein
before Poppie heads haue béene sodden. You may also vse Sieff de Rosis which followeth here∣after. Take fresh Rose leaues halfe an ounce, Saffron, Spica of Indie, Gummi Arabicum of each one quarter of an ounce, beate all small, and make cakes thereof with raine water: and when you will vse them, then take one dragme thereof, and lay them to stéepe in the beaten white of an egge. This is speciall good in the beginning of the hote Ophthalmia: for it repelleth the matter backe, it consumeth and asswageth the paine. In like manner, is this also following much commended: Take washt Ceruse, prepared Sarcocolla, Dragagant, Licium, Acatia, pils of Pome∣granates and Frankincense, of each one dragme, Pearles, Opium, of each halfe a scruple, and the iuice of Pomegranates (which is very cleare) as much as is néedfull for to make cakes or troscisces thereof when you will: then vse thereof. Then lay a dragme thereof to stéepe in Rose water; this hath a constringent vertue: it drieth & cooleth all hot humours: but when the paine is at the most, then temper among the foresayd medicines two or thrée graines of Opium, or of Sieff album, called Sieff Rasis. Take washt Ceruse one ounce, Gummi Arabicum halfe an ounce, Opium, Dragagant, of each halfe a dragme: this must you bruise verie small, and temper it with the well brayed white of an egge and womans milke. Take also the iuice of Fennell well scummed one ounce and a halfe, Aloe two dragmes and a halfe, a leafe of well beaten gold: temper them well, and after∣wards put vnto it the waight of seuen graines of Frankinsence: dissolue them in good white wine, and mixe them all togither with Fennell and Rose water: you must drop of this water twise a day in the eyes. Item take good Aloe stéeped in the iuice of Fennell: put thereto the waight often graines of Frankinsence burning therein, kindled at a candle, vse it as afore. Other waters moe. Take Rose water fower ounces, quench therein glowing gold, after∣wards put thereto Aloe, Frankinsence, Masticke, Litharge of siluer, of each one drag. let it séeth vntill a third part be consumed: afterwards, straine it through a cloth, and vse it as it is néedful. Item take Dragon bloud, Aloe, Sarcocolla, of each halfe a dragme, Saffron, Camfere, of each halfe so much, prepared Tutia one quarter of an ounce, bruise it very small, and temper amongst it wine of Nutmegs fower ounces, and as much Rose water: also let it séeth in water in a glasse, vntill about thrée parts be consumed: it drieth and healeth without any danger. Item take Aloe, Tutia, hony, Rue, Fenegréeke, Fennell; seeth it in wine: it is especiall good for all ouerhote eyes. This water following is also verie appropriate for the same disease: Take prepared Tutia one ounce, prepared Bloudstone one dragme, Frankinsence, Mastick, Pepper, of each a scrup. Fennell water, Eyebright water, of each one ounce, Rose water and Violet water, of each two ounces, old fine wine thrée or fower ounces: put it into a glasse, and let it séeth in water euen to the halfe, afterwards straine it through a cloth. A salue. Take the iuice of Rue, of Framboyes oyle, of Mirtle, of each one ounce, let it boyle vntil all the iuice be sodden away: then wring it through a cloth, and set it againe vpon the fire: mixe amongst it prepared Saphire halfe a dragme, Iacint one scruple, Antimonie one dragme, burnt Copper one scruple, prepared Tutia thrée dragmes, let it seeth softly with the foresayd fire: put thereto thrée dragms of Waxe be it more or lesse, accordingly as you desire to haue it hard: wherewith annoint the eyelids. This swageth the paine, stayeth all defluxions in the eyes, and taketh away the cause of them wonderfully. In running and ouermoyst eyes, take Myrrhe halfe a dragme, Bloudstone one dragme, the vppermost sprigs of Framboyes, and of the Rose trée, of each one ounce; seeth them togither in a glasse in water vnto the halfe: afterwards straine it forth through a cloth, and drop at least fower times a day one drop in the eyes. Secondly, the forehead and temples of the head are of∣tentimes, or at least against the euening, to be annointed softly with the iuice of Roses. But if this rheume be but in his increasing, or in Statu, which is at the highest; then may he very fréely put therein all the foresayd things, and chiefly womans milke (which is much com∣mended for this) also temper Dragagant amongst it, and drop in them. In like manner take prepared Tutia, Camfere, of each a scruple tēpered with halfe an ounce of white wine. It drieth and swageth all paine. This is also very good, Tutia tempered in Fennell water, in water of Celendine, of Rue, of Verueine, and in Rose water, and a gal of a Pickerell, or a Partridge put
thereto, and the same kept in a Copper vessell, vntill it be to be vsed: or take prepared Tutia one quarter of an ounce, white Amber one drag. Fennell and Rosewater, of each foure ounces, take also washt Ceruise one quarter of an ounce, prepared Sarcocolla, Dragagant, Opium, of each half a drag. Gummi Arabicum, Saffron, of each halfe a scrup. This being altogether beaten as smal as may be, temper it with raine water, and let it drie. And when as you will vse it, mixe it with womans milke. Here is to be noted, that raine water for all paine of the eyes is very méete, for that it is subtile. But whensoeuer this Ophthalmia cometh to abate, then may bathing be vsed: or that which is more sure, séeth Cammomill & Melilot in water, and make a spoonge wet therein, wringing it out a little, and so hold it warme vpon the eye, and when it is cold to make it warme againe. Or take fresh Wormwood, Lycium, Fenegréeke of each two ounces, Sarcocolla one ounce and a quarter, the iuice of Celendine halfe an ounce, Aloe one quarter of an ounce, Saffron, Sea∣froth, of each one drag. séeth that which is to be sodden, in raine water vnto a pap, and temper amongst it al that is beaten, and lay it warme ouer the eyes. It is also very good to wash hands, feete, and face oftentimes with the warme decoction of Wormwood, Melilot, and of Cammo∣mill. In like maner also is the yellow powder of Rasis in the declination of this defluxion much commended, which is thus to be made: Take Sarcocolla fiue drag. Aloe, Saffron, Lycium, of each one drag. Myrrhe halfe a drag. make a powder thereof. Bleared eyes of a cold cause. IF this defluxion or rheume come through cold, then at the first when it begin∣neth to fall, vse this confection: Take Indie Spica fiue drag. Agaricus one dra. and a halfe, Cinnamom one ounce, Masticke, as much as the waight of them all: also make a confection thereof with clarified honie, and vse thereof euery day. This patient is to smell vnto all warming and drying things, as Muscus, Lauander, Marioram, Amber, Betonie, Styrax Calamita, and such like, as also vnto the poman∣ders that euery where in this booke are specified. It is also very conuenient to chew and to eate a good deale of Fennell séede euery morning, Likewise also Rue and Verueine chewed, and the eyes annointed with the spettle. If so be that the eyes be filled with cold moisture that floweth out of the braines: for that is this following very good to be vsed. Take prepared Bloudstone one quarter of an ounce, Roses, burnt Yuorie, red and white Corall, Amber, yellow Mirobalans, of each one drag. the iuice of the sprigs of Fromboyes foure ounces, temper them together, and so keepe it well stopped: of this iuice put daily into the eyes, and annoint also the eyelids therewith. This doth drie the rheume maruellous much, and doth strengthen the eyes from taking any such moisture. Or take the iuice of Fennell, of Rue, of each one ounce, childrens vrine halfe an ounce, Aloe thrée drag. let it séeth somewhat, and then straine it thorow a cloth, and put a drop of the same in the eye: it cleanseth, drieth, and sharpeneth the sight. Item take Frankinsence, Masticke, Cipers nuts, Myrrhe, Aloe, of each one quarter of an ounce, Tutia, Sarcocolla, of each one drag. and a halfe, Dragons bloud, Sumach, Barberies, Ro∣ses, of each one scrup. make them to powder, or to trocisces with the iuice of Fennell, and vse it with Rose water or Fennell water. Item rost thrée apples, clense them of the pils and kernels, then temper them with the yolks of thrée new laid egges, and then lay it warme to the eyes. Item take Acatia, Dragons bloud, of each one drag. fine Bolus one quarter of an ounce: this being beaten together, then make it to a plaister with the white of an egge, and lay it round a∣bout the eyes from whence the rheume doth come: you may lay it also vpon the forehead, and vpon the lids of the eye: but then you must leaue out the Bolus. In winter time may one wash his eyes with the vrine of a man child and wine: in sommer with the vrine and with Rose water: that driueth away the rheume, and preserueth the sight wonderfully. This water following doth drie much the cold catarres: Take Gummi, the Muscilage of
Fenegréeke séedes, of each one quarter of an ounce, of prepared Sarcocolla, Spicanardi, Myrrhe, Cinnamom, Aloes, Beuer cod, of each halfe a scrup. this powdered all together small and made vp with womans milke. This following drieth also much the defluxion: Take an ounce of Tutia, bruise it very small in a mortar, put thereto 12. ounces of old sower wine, powre some vpon it, and bruise it well with the stamper: afterwards, powre wine vpon it againe: afterwards let it séeth together in a copper pan. When it is from the fire, then temper amongst it Aloes beaten small, one quar∣ter of an ounce, put two or thrée drops thereof in the eyes. Then lie vpon your backe the space of two howers. This discusseth the bloud also in the eyes, and taketh away all sharpnesse, and biting Rheumes. In like manner if this defluxion do make much paine, then take vnwashed shéepes wooll, burne it to ashes in a close stopt pot, bruise it as small as may be, and mixe it with the white of an egge: lay it on your forehead and on the temples of the head: this swageth the catarre very quickly, and abateth the paine.

A plaister. It is also profitable for such cold catarres, to haue a plaister laid vpon the tem∣ples of the head. The same is to be made thus: Take Aloe, Myrrhe, Mirtle leaues, Acatia, of each one drag. Masticke, Frankinsence, of each halfe a drag. beaten small together, make it to a plaister with the white of an egge. and lay it as is said on the forehead and temples of the head. Another. Some do coūsell for to take Assa foetida one ounce, Pepper one quarter of an ounce: melt and séeth the Gum in vineger vntill it be thicke, then stir Pepper amongst it, lay it ouer the eyes: but haue good regard, that there come none of it into the eye: it will stinke much, and is very daungerous for the eye. But there be other things that may be vsed for this purpose. Of actuall cauterisation in the necke in all Rheumes of the head. THis hath oftentimes also bene more remembred, and is often vsed by the ancient Phisi∣tions, euen as many Italian Phisitions do aduise, that in these cold rheumes or deflu∣xions, the necke is to be opened with an actuall or potentiall Cauterie, whereof diuers may be sought in the Register, and must be kept open about fortie dayes. What is conuenient for purging. THat is to be effected with the pils Cochiae, which be sharpened with the trocisces of Al∣handali, also with the confection of Hiera, and such like. In the declination of the rheume through cold, bathing is very meete, to wash himselfe with vrine, to drinke wine mode∣rately, to apply vnto it the foresaid sponge with the warme decoction of Cammomil & Melilot. Sore eyes with or without matter. §. 8. THese diseases doe come commonly through outward occasions, as of pricking, striking, or any other manner of bruising: in like manner, of inward causes, as hot, sharp, and salt rheumes, which do eate in and perish the pannicles of the eyes. If then there be perceiued great paine with pricking, beating, and with moist rheumes in the eyes, and the eyebrowes be fallen, the eyes stand wide open, the white of the eye looking red, and that some whitenesse be séene vpon the blacke: then is there an impostume growing, and indéede such accidents do verily require an expert Chirurgion: for (as the common prouerbe is) there is no iesting with the eyes. Therfore to this end and intent shall hereafter be presented and deliuered many good medicines: and we will first begin with things
which are caused through inward sharp Rheumes: It is to be noted, that the Impostume that commeth in the white of the eye, is not so much to be feared, as they that come vpon the star or blacke: for that they are the most dangerous. Amongst which, one is called the Canker, which commeth of melancholicke humours: and the signes be, that this Impostume doth shew it selfe with heate and heauinesse of the minde: the face and the eyes are of a leaden colour: It maketh great pricking paine in the eyes, and in the temples of the head, on the side whereas the disease is. And if there be applied thereto any hote things, then doth the paine increase manifestly, the appetite to meate is lost, and all the face getteth another colour: Therefore when that is seene and perceiued, then must it be with all spéede preuented. And first to begin with a necessarie let∣ting of bloud, and purging: The patient must be forbidden wine, and flesh, and specially swéete wines. His meate must be cooling hearbes, as Spinage, Lettice, Purcelane, Gourds: Endiue water must be his best drinke: much letting of bloud (if the partie may suffer it) is good. And if so be that the impostume do appeare very great, then is the patient to be let bloud the more in the Median or in the Saphea, on the same side: afterwards in the liuer veine, alwayes regarding the time of the yeare, and the patients abilitie. But if the Impostume be not so great, you may be content with the opening of the liuer veine or Median onely: hereby will the Rheume be cut off, that it cannot fall any more into the eyes. For this are méete also boxing cups set vpon the shoulders and higher, with picking: But if the matter be sharpe and bitting, one must purge with Mirobalans, Manna, laxatiue iuices of fruits, and such like. Afterwards the patient must be caused to néese, and to gargarise, whereof you haue before in the second Chapter and §. 2. good instruction, & shall haue hereafter in other more places. When as this is effected and done, you may vse of these medicines which you will. First there is Sief album, (not long since described in the 7. §.) tempered with womans milke. If it leaue beating, then it is a good token, and hope that the sorenesse or paine wil weare away without impostumation: but if it come to impostumate, then must it be clensed with Hy∣dromel, or honie of Roses, tempered with raine water, making a linnen cloth wet therein, and so layd on it. Secondly, with astringent things; as the Sief de Thure, which is forcible for all humours and defluxions of the eyes. Thirdly, with drying medicines; as with well prepared Tutia, and chiefly with the plaister de Muscilaginibus, which is described in the sixt Chapter, and in the end of the 7. §. Will you then haue some part of the Catarre repelled? Then put thereto the Muscilage of Fleawoorte, or of Quince kernels, the which must thrée or foure times a day be layd vpon the eyes, mixed alwayes with Sief de Thure: to wit, as long as the matter cleaueth to the apple of the eye, and no longer. A good salue. Take Tutia prepared in Rosewater halfe an ounce, fresh Swines grease one ounce, Starch thrée quarters of an ounce: bruse it long in a morter one amongst another: after∣wards wash it thrée times in the water of Nightshade, and annoint the forehead, the temples of the head, & the eyelids with it, without and within. This salue is maruellous good for all im∣postumate and running eyes, as also for al paines of the eyes, bloudshots, scabs, and wounds of the eyes. Some do vse also the maiden milk, or Lac Virginis, (which is described in the fift Chap∣ter and the 1. §.) but it is somewhat sharpe in the eyes. If there be any sharpe Catarre that falleth into the eyes; take warme white bread, stéepe it in womens (or any other) milke, and lay it vpon the eyes. Item take a white loafe, cut slices thereof a finger thicke, lay them to stéepe in Well water, and lay them on the eyes. Oyle of burnt linnen is also very good for the impostumate eyes, which is to be made as here∣after followeth. Lay cleane and washed linnen clothes in a glassen helme, strew powned glasse vpon it, a∣gaine afterwards another lay of clothes, and glasse againe, vntill the helme be halfe full: after∣ward distill it in sand. Some do burne it in gilt boules, and giue it for the plague. Item set the clothes on fire with a candle, lay them vpon an euen péece of iron, tinne, or siluer, and put them presently out againe. Then shall you alwayes find a drop of oyle, the which take vp with a fea∣ther, and so gather it. This healeth maruellous well the impostumation of the eyes, taketh a∣way the paine, and is good for the fistula and wounds in the eyes. Clarified hony annointed in the corners of the eyes doth heale all diseases. This Collyrium following is aboue all measure much commended; a little of it being dropped
often in the eye, for it healeth and strengtheneth the sight mightily. A precious water for the eyes.Take Rue, Roses, Endiue, Betonie, Veruein, Venus haire, Agrimonie, Cleuers, Milfoile, Eybright, Chamedris, Pimpernell, Sage, of each two M. cut them small, stéepe them a day and a night in good Wine: afterwards wring them out, and spread them on a boord that the moi∣sture may runne off: ten houres afterwards beate them grosse, and distill them in water, and kéepe it stopt close. Item, take the iuice of Celendine one ounce, the iuice of Fennell one ounce and a halfe, Oxe gall fiue drag. and one scrup. Wolfes gall thrée quarters of an ounce, prepared Tutia, halfe an ounce, temper them all together, this dryeth much the impostumate eyes. Item, take Poppy leaues one M. Verueine, Eyebright, Fennell, Mallowes, Hollihockes, Cammomill, of each halfe a M. chop it and stampe it to pap, mixe it with oyle of Roses, make a cloth wet therein, and lay it ouer the eyes. It is a generall commaundement, that where one v∣seth water for the eyes, you must bind it hard with twice double linnen, whereby the medicins applyed fall not off through néesing, coughing, or any other stirring or motion of the head. Impostumes of the eyes through outward occasions. IF so be that the impostumes of the eyes be caused through any outward occasion, as through thrusts, strokes, and such like, then are the déepe thrusts or pricks dan∣gerous and most to be feared, lest blindnesse do insue. But these meanes following are to be vsed for the same: Take vnpared Quinces, the kernels being taken out, beate them small, and temper meale of Lentils amongst them, and a little honie, that there may be a plaister made of them: lay the patient vpon his backe, and apply some ther∣of vpon his eye. Or take a whole Pomegranate, betwéene sowre and swéet; séeth it in a little Vineger,A drying and astringent Collyrium. stampe it, and vse it as before. Item, take the yolke of a rosted egge, lay it with towe vpon the eye. Item, vse also waters for the eyes that are drying and astringent, as hereafter followeth: take powned Bloudstone that is nine times washt in the vrine of a man child or boy, one quarter of an ounce, Gummi Arabicum, Dragagant, burnt Copper, of each one dragm. burnt and washt Pumis stone, Opium, of each a scrup. Fennell water as much as is néedfull for to forme small trocisces thereof: when you will vse them, then stéepe them in white wine. The eyes are also to be often washed with water wherein Roses are decocted, or well water tempe∣red with Vineger and foure Wine: for this is also fit, Oliue leaues, and if they cannot be had, then in the stead of them is the iuice of Shepheards purse vsed, wherein burnt lead brused smal is to be tempered, also the iuice of Quince leaues, and Medlar leaues, and then sallad oile must be put amongst it, and so lay it ouer the sore eye. Where the eyes do bake together in the sleepe. TAke the iuice of Housléeke, and annoint the eyes therewith: it doth soke them softly, and coole them. Item, take iuice of Agrimonie alone, or tempered with womans milke: also Rosewa∣ter, and other waters for to soke therewith the dryed matter of them. Of Aegylops, a certaine swelling betweene the nose and the corner of the eye. §. 9. THere commeth otherwhiles a small impostume betwéene the nose and the corner of the eye, the which the Phisitions call Aegylops. If the same be not holpen betimes, then doth it infect the bone. The Chirurgeons do heale the same in this manner: they cut vp the vppermost skinne, and wring out the impostume which lyeth lockt in a little bladder, and cut it off as neare as may be, the rest do they take away with an actuall or potentiall Cauterie. The same swelling doth settle it selfe otherwhiles in the length of the eyelids, yet both are to be holpen with Oatmeale, Wine, and Tutia tempered together in manner of a Salue.
Of Blemishes or spots in the Eyes. §. 10. THese are two speciall kindes; red, and white: The red are caused thorough bloud, when there appeareth in the eye a red drop, or a darke (like as a congea∣led bloud) which at times is also blacke: that is woont to be caused of blowes, falles, great labour, much wéeping, and such like. In like manner also of in∣ward causes, as hath bene said of Ophthalmia, and of red or ouerheated eyes. For this is also much commended, the bloud of Turtle doues, wild Pige∣ons, or (if one cannot haue them) of common house Pigeons being let bloud vnder the wings, (like as is alreadie rehearsed) and chiefly in the beginning, if one temper some fine Bolus among it, and the eyes to be fomented with warme water wherin wild Time, Marioram, Fennel and Barley is decocted. A water for the eyes. Take the séede of Ameos, Comin, Fennell rootes and the séedes sodden together, and a little Salgemmae tempered amongst it: you shall oftentimes let some thereof drop into the eyes. If it be néedfull to vse any stronger thing for it, then take one quarter of an ounce of Orpi∣ment, put eight ounces of water vnto it, stir it well about, & then let it settle: powre the water cleare from it, that no substance of the Orpiment run with it, and drop thereof in the eye. But good héed must be taken in the vse of this sharpe venime, that there follow no bad accident after it: therefore it is more sure to vse this following: Take prepared Bloodstone thrée drag. burnt Copper one quarter of an ounce, red Corall, Pearles, of each halfe a dragm. Gummi, Tragacant of each two dragmes and a halfe, Pepper the waight of thirtie graines, washed Ceruise one drag. Orpiment, Dragon bloud, Saffron, Amber, of each halfe a drag. make a dough thereof with the blood of Turtle doues, of Hennes, or common Pigeons bloud, and forme Trocisces thereof about the waight of one dragm. When you will vse these, bruise them in womans milke, and put a drop thereof in the eye. It is also very good for the skinnes of the eyes, whereof we purpose to intreate hereafter. A plaister. Take Doues dung, make it with wine and vineger into a plaister, and apply it lukewarme vpon the eyes. Or take that which followeth which is most certaine. Take Raisins, put out the stones, powne them, and put vineger to it, vse it as before. Item take fresh chéese méetly salted, Radishes rosted in ashes, Melilot, Cammomill, of each one ounce, rosted Lillie rootes, meale of Lentils, Dragon bloud, of each halfe an ounce, Saffron one quarter of an ounce: temper them all together with the brayed white of an egge, vnto a plaister. In like manner it is also good to foment the eyes with the decoction of Coleworts, and the leaues thereof (sodden together in wine in manner of a plaister with Cammomill) laid vpon the eyes. Now concerning the white spots which do come commonly after the Impostume of the eyes. Of these some are thin, and some are thicke. But they that stand vpon the white and be thin, do the sight no hurt: but those that are thicke, and lie vpon the apple of the eye, they re∣maine and are almost vnpossible to be healed, but to be somewhat eased, and rather in children then in aged folkes. Now albeit that this is hardly effected without the manuall operation of an Occulist: yet neuerthelesse are these things very good for it, and especially if the same be white and thin. First of all, he is to bath oftentimes in water, or at the leastwise to foment his face and eyes so long with warme water, vntill the face be thorowly red and sweating: and if that therby be caused a rednesse or paine of the eyes, it is to be omitted certaine dayes, and afterwards begin againe. Also you may vse water wherein Mallowes, Hollihocke rootes, Oaten straw, Barley, Otes, and chiefly Fenegréeke are decocted; for this is a certaine and approoued receipt. After this fomenting, strew this powder therein: take Sarcocolla, white Sugar, Spuma maris, of each a like much, and bruise it very small. Item take Cuttle bone powdered small, and temper it with womans milke. Take swallowes dung, honie as much as is needfull, and if you will make it soft, mixe it
with Fennell water. But the storie of Tobias doth shew that this medicine is especially pe∣rilous. Make the eyes oftentimes moyst with fresh womans milke, but if you cannot get it, then vse the waters wherein Mallowes & Hollihock rootes be decocted: afterwards you may put there∣to the Sieff de Thure, the which you must prepare like as hereafter followeth. Take Frankinsence fiue dragmes, Ammoniacum, Sarcocolla, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Saffron one dragme, beate them all vnto an impalpable powder, and with the musci∣lage of Fenegreeke make it into trocisces: vse it with womans milke, it doth mundifie the eyes apparantly. In like manner, the Seiff de Plumbo doth ingender flesh where there be small sores and spots, and it is thus made: Take burnt Lead, Antimonie, prepared Tutia, burnt Copper; Gummi Dragagant, of each halfe an ounce, Opium fiteene graines: make it very subtile, and forme Tro∣cisces thereof with rayne water: It is verie good for all diseases of the eyes, it cleanseth and driueth the matter out of the eyes, when it is mixt with Rose water, it taketh away all man∣ner of vncleannesse out of the eyes, and stayeth the defluxion also, but preserueth especially the sight of the eye. Item, take Litharge of siluer brused verie small, Comin, Bayberies, Gallingall, Ginger, Aristologie, Cloues, Nutmegs, of each one dragme beaten small, put a pint of Malmesey vnto it, or any other strong Wine: stirre it well about thrée or foure dayes, afterwards straine it through a cloth into an other glasse, and preserue it well stopped, for it is good for all spots of the eyes, and also for al fractures of the bones, & it draweth the wounds togither without stitching. First take water that droppeth from distilled honie two ounces, Sugarcandie one quarter of an ounce,Vertues of Sugar candy. Water of Rosemarie for the eyes. drop it twice a day in the eyes. Sugarcandie is good for all diseases of the eyes, and for the sight. Rosemary water made vnder the earth is also verie good for these blemishes of the eyes, the which some do thus prepare: Fill a glasse with Rosemary flowers, stop it with waxe on the top, and burie it in the Dogdayes about halfe a foote déepe in the earth fortie dayes long, and then yeeldeth it a water. When the pearles or Velmes be new. WHen the pearles or spots be new, there are foure kinds of waters to be vsed for thē. First of all (as is somtimes admonished) let womans milke be drop∣ped into it, & afterwards fine brused Cuttle bone blowne into the eyes. Se∣condly, take the iuice of Corneroses and of Centorie, of each one ounce, ho∣nie two ounces. Thirdly, take Swallowes dung brused small and drie, halfe an ounce, honie as much as it néedefull. For to make a dough, let it dry: take thereof one dragme and a half, Eybright water two ounces, tem∣per them togither: this is wonderfull, but (as is already sayd) perilous. Fourthly, take Cuttle bone two dragmes, Sugar one dragme, make a subtile powder thereof, and let some of it be blowne into the eyes: But if the fleckes be out, then are they to be fomen∣ted with womans milke, or with the decoction of Hollihock rootes, Mallowes, Barley or Oate straw: afterwards this following is good. Take fresh egge shels, burne them a little, the dung of a gréene Lizard, Spuma maris, Sarcocolla, that hath lyen certaine dayes in the iuice of Celen∣dine, washt Ceruise, of each one dragme, prepared Tutia, Sagapenum, Galbanum, of each halfe a dragme, Cuttlebone, Ginger, of each one scruple, Kites gall two scruples, powne all that is to be powned, and temper it with the water of Celendine. For this serueth also the foresayd Rosemary water, which is made vnder the earth. Fourth∣ly take Verdigreace one dragme, Frankinsence two dragmes, Vitrioll halfe a dragme, Spuma maris, Celendine, Rue, Roses, Rosemary, of each one ounce and a half: séeth well the last foure, vntill there remaine about foure ounces: mixe the other powders with this decoction, and let it drie. Afterwards beate it againe, and temper it as before, do this foure times togither. Lastly, make a subtile powder of it, and vse it vpon the pearles. It doth strengthen the sight, and taketh away the white pearles without paine: but if it be thicke or old, so that none of these will helpe it, then is the last meane to take it away with the needle, which belongeth onely to the manuall operators or Occulists.
Of the Fistula in the corner of the eye. §. 11. THere be many Chirurgeons that describe these Fistulaes amongst other vlcers of the eyes: in which place, namely, in the fift part of this booke we shall describe their natures, and what vlcerations they be: but we will here onely write of this Fi∣stula, which is woont to appeare in the corner of the eye. The causes of this are badde humors, and for the most part cold, which do a long time in this place settle themselues, pu∣trifie, and lstly impostumate. The signes thereof are humours of the place: and if any wring it, then it doth paine one: it is somewhat reddie, giueth afterwards gréene matter; and it happe∣neth, that it oftentimes hurteth the eyelids and the nose. But before that the Fistula be tou∣ched with any application or cauterie, the patient must be prescribed an order of diet, and must purge well. For diet: first, he must beware of all fatte and strong sauouring meates, of milke, moist fruites, Onions, Garlicke Mustard, and all that is much salted. In like sort, all that may replenish the head with hote vapours, as Spices, sléepe immediatly after meales, and doing violent exercise. For to purge, one drag. of the pils of Hiera Composita is to be taken: Make fiue or sixe pilles thereof with the sirupe of Calamintha: If you will first vse preparatiues, then take of the foresaid sirupe one ounce, Oxymel Compositum halfe an ounce, decoction of Mace three ounces. Are you afraid of the heate of the liuer? Take some cooling things therewith, as Cicorie water, or any such like. One may vse foure of these potions in the space of eight dayes; in the morning, and at the same time that the bodie is stopped. He is to take euery other day, or euery day, one pil of Aloephangine before meate, or washed Aloe. After the taking of these foure potions, these pils following are to be vsed, Pil. de Sarcocolla two scrup. Cochiarum one scrup. make with the sirupe of Roses seuen pils of them: afterwards you are to vse euery morning this Collyrium following: and after that, apply this plaister on the corner of the eye. Take prepared Antimonie, Fran∣kinsence, of each one scrup. prepared Sarcocolla, one drag. Licium, Dragon bloud, burnt Iuorie, parched Dragagant, prepared Iron drosse, of each thrée drag. Rue, Nightshade, and Celendine waters, of each one ounce; let this drie, vntill one may forme dowe thereof: when you will vse thereof, then dissolue it in the foresaid waters, and put two or thrée drops thereof in the eyes. For a plaister: Take Mommy, fine Bolus, the iuice of Sloes, Frankinsence, Hippocystis, Ma∣sticke, of each thrée drag. Acorne cups, Cipers nuts, Gals that are woorme eaten, Isenglas, Dragagant, Gum, of each one ounce. The Isenglas must be dissolued in red vineger, and tem∣per the other ingredients amongst it, and make thereof a plaister. If it be then perceiued that the corner of the eye watereth, and if one wring or presse vpon it, there come matter out of it: then it is a Fistula, and the actuall cauterie is the best meane to heale it: for otherwise it is very vncertaine as Rasis writeth: he found this medicine first, that the Fistula doth thereby cease certaine moneths, that one would thinke the same to be thorow whole, and is thus prepared. Take Aloe, Frankinsence, Sarcocolla, Dragon blood, blossomes of Pomegranates, Antimo∣nie, Allume, of each a like much, Verdigrease the fourth part of one of them, make a powder thereof: when it is then néedfull, wring the Fistula so long, vntill it yeeld matter. Lay the pa∣tient on the contrarie side where the Fistula is not, and temper this powder with a little wo∣mans milke, and drop a drop in it. Now, and a certaine season afterwards one more, and so foure times one after another: let him lye the space of three howers. Do this the space of a weeke, and looke well to it that the Fistula be wrung out, and yéeld no more corruption or mat∣ter. Now although (as it is said) the accident is vncertaine to be healed, yet is there amongst all the rest, Rue most highly commended for it. When that the Fistula is made wet with the iuice of Rue, and wine of Pomegranates, and couered with a double cloth, also if the cause require to open the Fistula so wide vntill one may sée the bottome of the same, which may be effected with the drie roote of Gentian, Elderne pith, or with an Iron. Secondly, the spoongions flesh which lyeth at the bottome, and is the right roote of the Fistula, must be killed. The which must be effected with an actuall or potentiall cauterie. The corosiue is made thus: Take Orpi∣ment, Vitrioll, Cantarides the heads and wings taken off, quicke Lime, Salarmoniack, Allum,
of each one scruple: beate them to powder, and make a dough thereof with the vrine of a man child; let the same dry, and lay somwhat thereof euery morning in the fistula: th will cleanse it. Also you may vse this following, which is also very good. Take Ginger three dragmes, Verdigrease one dragme, beate them small togither, and séeth them in halfe an ounce of vineger vntil it be thicke: annoint the taint with it, or that which you shall lay in the fistula. Item take fresh Rue, Agrimonie, Celendine, of each a dragme, beate them and séeth them in sixe ounces of Aqua vitae, or water of Rue, vnto the halfe; put some thereof euery day in the fi∣stula, two or thrée times. Thirdly, it must be cleansed, which is to be effected with Hydromel, and Rue water, and honie of Roses, or with sowre wine wherein Roses are sodden. Fourthly, for to cause the flesh to grow or incarnate; you shall take Aloe, Frankincense, Sarcocolla, steeped in Fennell water, oyle of Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, Waxe as much as is néedfull for a salue: one may put thereto one quarter of an ounce of Ineos. In like manner Agrimonie is highly commended, & Rue leaues, of each one dragme decocted vnto the halfe in a pinte of wine, the same being wrong out, and vsed euery day, like as is aforesayd. If Gnats, Flies, or any such like thing seeme to swarme before the Eyes. §. 12. THis disease procéedeth of flegmaticke and melancholie humours which fall out of the braines into the eyes, oppilating the sinewes of the sight more or lesse, accor∣ding as the defluxion is tough, hard, thin, much, or little. The Phisitions do call this accident Catarractam, as a cadent water. It doth sometimes proceede of a fowle stomacke, or through some disease of the eyes: but if it be caused of the stomacke, then is the danger not so great: for assoone as the occasion is taken away, then auoideth that which is caused thereof. But the other is much to be feared, and very needefull to be looked vnto, whilest it is yet time: but when it waxeth old it is incurable by Phisicke: and can by no meanes be holpen, but through the néedle, and that is al∣so vncertaine. That which is caused from the stomacke, maketh before both the eyes buzzing and flying, as if there were Gnats or somewhat else, that swarmed so before the eyes; and that much more, if the stomacke be full, then when it is emptie. Also whensoeuer such fantasies do continue, endu∣ring before the eyes the space of a moneth or twaine without any alteration of the apple of the eye, or disclosing of any other signes; then may one assuredly iudge, that these diseases are cau∣sed of the stomacke: for this patient is a certaine order of diet to be ordained, and he must purge with Pilluls Cochijs. But if this swarming of the Gnates or flies be onely before one eye, and not to be wiped off; then may it well be déemed that this disease commeth by reason of some moisture wt lieth clo∣sed in the eyes, especially if one sée no dark thing in the eye: but if one perceiue any darke thing therein, then without all doubt the sinew of the eye is stopt and obstructed. Now for to helpe this infirmitie, there is nothing more to be aduised then to begin with a good diet: first is héede to be taken, that the whole body, and especially the head be couered well, and kept warme: he must refraine all moist ayre and dwelling, and not looke much into the water (specially where it is much stirred with the wind) he must oftentimes fasting rub and combe his head. He must bath his feete before supper with this decoction following: Take Bay leaues, Sage, Betonie, Stechas, Penniroyall, and such like, except Smallage and Dill. Item let him be often times rub∣bed with warme clothes from the necke to the shoulders downwards: after meate he must re∣fraine from forcible exercise, and (if it be possible) he must abstaine thrée houres from writing, and beware of all hard meate; but vse all that warmeth. And to recite somewhat therof in particular, well salted and raised bread is not amisse to be vsed, wherein Fennell séede or Fennell powder is baked. Concerning flesh, there is nothing more commodious, then sucking Veale, young Mutton, Roe déere, Kids, and Hares. Of foules, young Hens, Pullets, Capons, young Pigeons, (and chiefly wild ones, which haue a secret vertue to strengthen the braines) Partridges, Snipes, Fesants, and Quailes: the Blackbird is also permitted for this, Riuer fish are more wholesome then other: neuerthelesse other fish are
tolerated measurably vsed and broyled, dressed with Pepper, Ginger, Fennell, Annis séede, Parsley, Verueine, Eybright, and Rue. One may eate egges after what manner he list: onely so that they be not hard baked, sodden, or rosted. Further, Sugar, Hony, Veriuice, the iuice of Limons, and Citrons, herbs of a warme nature, as Sage, all manner of Mints, Penniroyall, Hyssope, & wild Thime, are all good. All kind of Rapes, all their séed confited doth strengthen the sight. Of all fruits are allowed fresh Figs, Almonds, rosted hasil Nuts, Pistacies, rosted Chest∣nuts, Corans, Raisons, Sallet oile, Oile of Walnuts, Oile of swéet Almonds. These Spices following may he also vse, as Pepper, Galingale, Cloues, Nutmegs, Mace, Ginger, Cyna∣mom, Graines, Lignum Aloes, Comin, fresh Fennell, Eyebright strewed vpon his meate, or take halfe an ounce of Eyebright, one quarter of an ounce of Mace; and alwaies take one scrup. thereof before meate, for this hath bene found to haue oftentimes holpen them that had their sight blemished: Rue séede is also very good, and for them that haue this passion in the eyes, are the herbs, rootes, and séedes of Pyonie good, howsoeuer they be prepared for the taking. Also Treacle and Mithridate, haue a speciall propertie to put away the clouds, and all that swarme before the eyes. Auenzoar doth write, that all they which be burthened with the forementioned Cataracts or dimnesse, that if they looke earnestly into the eye of an Asse, thereby the defluxion should be stayed: but if so be that this be true, it is a wonderfull worke of nature. This pow∣der following may also be vsed for an approued thing, for many haue bene holpen thereby. Take Eyebright with the flowers beaten small, Mace, of each an ounce and a halfe, siluer mountaine thrée quarters of an ounce, Sugar foure ounces and a halfe: make a powder thereof. It is also very good, that one hold his face oftentimes ouer the vapor of the decoction of Ce∣lendine, Fennell, and Eyebright: but such like moe shall follow hereafter. What these patients must refraine. EVery such patient must beware of those things that make great disturbance in the head, as anger, calling, crying aloud, raging, sorrow, stench, and from much wat∣ching, because they much weaken the naturall heate. But he must oftentimes let bloud, and vse boxing cups. But as concerning his meate: there are hurtfull for him all still standing waters, seafish, and all fish which are taken in moorish waters, to be eaten ra∣ther sodden then broyled if one should often eate of them, Crabs, Eeles, Tenches is he vtterly: to forbeare: also milke, and all that is drest with milke, and he must not vse much vineger but only outwardly. All herbes of cold and moist natures, as Endiue, Béetes, Spinage, Purslain, Lettice, Cucumbers, Gourds, and chiefly Colewoorts which darken the sight, are to be es∣chewed and left. Of all rootes are chiefly forbidden Garlicke, Onions, Radishes. In like man∣ner also all pottages (except red pease, which be called Cichelings) Rice, Wheate, and Bar∣ley: all fruites which be swéete and cold, as Apples, Cherries, Pingles (whether they be con∣fected or not) are to be refrained. And he must chiefly beware of all that which prouoketh née∣sing, and the cough. There is nothing better for his drinke, then cleare wine of a good tast, and that is meetly strong, but a little at once. But they that drinke no wine, or haue no wine, may vse from October vnto March this following: Take Verueine, Celendine, Rue, Eyebright, of each one quarter of an ounce, séeth them in twelue quarts of water, vntill the third part be consumed, put 14. pound of honie vnto it: seeth it againe vntill about the third part be sodden away, alway skumming it, then straine it thorow a cloth, and kéepe it stopt close in a pot. Now if the sicke person desire it, then may wine (that is méete for the eyes) the fift or sixt part be tem∣pered amongst it. By this drinke hath bene perceiued much amendment, and that in auncient folks who had a darke sight haue bene holpen therewith. Also Hydromel, which is hony water or mead, is much commended for this, without any addition. Euery one may diminish or in∣crease the quantitie of the hony euen as it pleaseth him best. For as much as concerneth purging, which is excéeding néedfull, he must know to direct him according to the time of the yeare, otherwise in winter then in sommer, otherwise in the spring of the yeare then in haruest, or fall of the leafe, which were too long to rehearse at this present, & therfore we will recommend that to the Phisitions. But there are to be commonly vsed Pilulae Cochiae, de Sarcocolla, Sine quibus, De hiera Composita, Lucis, of the confections Hiera Picra, Bene∣dicta
laxatiua, & Hiera longodion. The Clisters are to be decocted with the common hearbes, and tempered with one ounce of Hiera. Further it is then commanded to take in winter a péece of confected Ginger: in like manner also after dinner and supper to vse one of the tabulats follow∣ing: Take Spec. de Xylo, Aloe thrée drag. Diacinamomi one drag. white Sugar foure ounces, séeth them with Fennell water, and cast Tabulates thereof of a méetly bignesse. And if he begin to perceiue any clearenesse, he must in the beginning of March drinke of this decoction following foure ounces alwaies foure houres before meate in the morning: first, take Ginger, white Pepper, Calmus, of each one drag. floures of Eyebright, Balsam wood, of each a quarter of an ounce, thrée cleansed Hermodactils, stampe them all together, and séeth them in thrée pints of water, vntil two parts be consumed. Secondly, take the iuice of Fennell, common ley which is not sharpe, of each two ounces, Tutia prepared with the vrine of a manchild one drag. and a halfe: set this the space of 20. dayes in the Sun, and vse it as shall be declared here∣after. Thirdly, take iuice of Roses one drag. common ley, Eyebright water, of each one ounce, set it (as is said) in the Sunne, and make the eyes therewith moist euery morning and euening two houres before meate: vse also the iuice of Roses alone, annoint therewith the forehead and the temples of the head. Before supper he is to take all the spring time a quarter of an ounce of Diacorum. Fourthly, take Gall, Masticke, sealed earth, the iuice of Sloes, of each one dragm. Sandaraca one ounce, the iuice of Roses as much as is néedefull to stéepe the same in: bray it all together in a mortar vntill it be méetly thicke: annoynt therewith alwaies euery third day when you go to bed, the forehead, and the temples of the head. Fiftly, take Mace, Eybright, of each one drag. and a halfe, Lignum Aloe one quarter of an ounce, Fennell, Comin, Ameos, of each halfe a drag. Amber two scrup. Séeth this all together in a pint of Fennell water vnto the halfe: take alwaies foure ounces at once tempered with Sugar: drinke thereof foure times a wéeke, thrée houres before meate. In the sommer you are to vse this following euery morning, at the least euery second day, then must you chew (but not swallow) a péece of Masticke and Cucubes. Item, take Fennell, Celendine, Rue, the iuice of Roses of each thrée ounces, Sugarcandie, white Sugar, of each sixe ounces, Sugar pennets, foure ounces, of Fennell séede, Licorice, Violets, Roses, Eyebright, of each one ounce, Pistaces thrée drag. that haue bene stéeped fiue dayes in Eyebright water, and be dryed againe: powne them all to powder. The Sugar is to be sodden vnto a Sirupe for to make a confection thereof, and take thereof euery morning about half an ounce. Secondly take the iuice of Verueine two ounces, the iuice of Roses, of Fennell, water wherein Licorice hath béene sodden, of each two ounces, the gall of a Pickrell one drag. temper it, and set it 15. daies in the Sunne. This Collyrium is to be put once or twice into the eyes before meate, or at least moisten them therewith, for it is very good and sure. In the beginning of haruest, and after purging, one must vse to chewe sometimes Calmui, otherwhiles Nutmegs, Galingall, or as much Agaricus as the bignesse of a beane: spew out the slime (as is said) and then vse the confection with the salue of the forehead. A plaister for the head: Take cleane Laudanum halfe an ounce, Rosen one quarter of an ounce, Celendine, Lignum Aloes, of each one drag. Cloues halfe a drag. melt the two first in sharp Vine∣ger, temper them afterwards with strong Wine, and let them all séeth thicke with the herbes: put the spice vnto it, and make a plaister thereof, and spread it on lether, couer it with red Syn∣dall, make it that it be as large til it come ouer the eyes: this warmeth, dryeth moderately, and strengtheneth the braines. This powder following may also be strewed vpon the head, take Lignum Aloes, Eyebright, wild Time, Hysope, Stechas, of each one drag. Mace thrée quarters of an ounce, Violets one drag. and a halfe, powne each of them by themselues, and temper them well: thereof strew vpon the head alwaies two houres after supper, on the top of the crowne a∣bout the waight of a scruple, and that once in thrée or foure daies: the same helpeth much. Or take this powder following: Lignum Aloes, Cloues, Cardamome, of each halfe a drag. Amber, Eyebright, Fennel, floures of Celendine, Roses, of each one scrup. Mace one drag. make there∣of a fine powder, and vse it as before: but take not more then sixe graines thereof at one time, and when you will strew more vpon it, then first brush off the former. Item, wind small stamped Marioram in a péece of silke, and smell oftentimes thereto, fume also your head or hat oftentimes with Lignum Aloes ouer the fire.
There may also sometime be vsed drying head ley, wherof euery where many be discouered. Famous Phisitians do also require to take euery moneth an ounce and three quarters of Hiera Piera, tempered with Fennell water, and that without any feare, for that it is a gentle medi∣cine. There may be taken euery moneth in the steade of the other, two scruples of the powder of Centorie, with Fennell water, and fast sixe houres after it. With the things that are to be dropt in, one must go to worke very prouidently, and that not carelesly, but onely in great néede, and when the body is well clensed. Amongst the same be these commended, which are also the least: Take the iuice of Fennell well clensed two ounces, let one dragme of Salgemma be dissolued therein, put thrée or foure times a day one drop thereof in∣to the eye. Or take the iuice of Fennell as it is, or that which is thicke one dragme, bruise it in an ounce of the water of Eyebright, vse it as before. For this are also good the gals of rauening birds, and also of Fesants, Partridges, and such like, which eate no flesh. This simple Collyrium following is very much commended: Take the gall of a Pickerell one quarter of an ounce, Sal∣gemma halfe a scruple; let them melt togither. In like manner this following: Take the fresh li∣uer of a sownd Bucke being washed, pricke it well through, and fill it with long Pepper, Fen∣nell and Eyebright powder, of each a like much: put it on a spit, and let it rost by a gentle fire, receiue the iuice that droppeth from it in a cleane pot, and vse it as a Collyrium. Or take in the end of Aprill the iuice of Fennell, stop it tight in a glasse, and set the same fif∣téene dayes in the sunne: afterwards straine it through a cloth, and temper Aloes vnto it sixe ounces, one ounce of Lignum Aloes beaten small: let it afterwards stād fifteene dayes in the sun, and straine it againe through a cloth, and vse it as is rehearsed already. This following is also many times well approued. Take Swallowes heads, burne them to ashes in a couered pot; take one quarter of an ounce thereof, clarified honie three ounces, the iuice of Fennell one ounce; temper them all togither in a glasse, stop them tight, and seeth them in water vnto the halfe: vse thereof morning and euening, and before and after meate, one drop. Item burne Fennell stalks to ashes, powre lye vpon it, wash therewith the eyes and eyelids, for it is verie good. It is likewise also good that each one vse his owne vrine, or that of a man child. Forasmuch then as for these diseases there be many kindes of remedies described, therefore may one chuse that which liketh him best, and to follow all that one findeth to do good, for there are not so many described that they should altogither be vsed, but because that one might chuse thereof, and vse onely all that one may get most easily. Of the Skin of the Eye. §. 13. IT is declared in the beginning, that out of old Catar acts there doth easi∣ly engender a skin, and the starre, which will take away the sight; whereof we now meane to write: there be therefore commonly two kindes of them disco∣uered by the Phisitians; as the red and the white. The red do the Arabians name Sebet, which commeth of aboundance of bloud in the small veines of the eyes, which doth spread it selfe abroad ouer the whole eye, so that it seemeth to be a red cloth; whereof insueth a great itch. The patient can abide by no meanes any light, nor sunne, nor fire. This disease will be sometimes also (as is reported) inherited from the parents, but it infecteth not any body else. It is grieuous and tedious to be cured, it so be that the ma∣nuall operation be not vsed vsed thereto. For this, one of the chiefest things is to leade an or∣dered life, to vse that which is good, and to eschew that which is ill, like as is sufficiently shewed in the 12. §. and is méete for this purpose. For purging are the Pillulae Cechiae or such like requi∣site. Also for this is aduised to open the head veine: And for the itch, to wash the eyes with water wherein Roses, Sorrell and Mallowes are decocted. Or you may prepare this powder: take fresh eg shels, that haue béen infused nine dayes in vineger, afterwards seeth them a good space in the same vineger, dry them in the shadow, stampe and bruse the same: this powder is to be vsed oftentimes in the eyes. Some do temper amongst it Sarcocolla, Aloe, Ginger, Gumme, of each the third part of the eg shels, and make it with Eybright water vnto a Collyrium: It may be vsed in maner of a pow∣der,
being beaten small. Item take Ceruise which is washt nine times in Rosewater, one drag. burnt Copper, Gum∣mi Dragagant, prepared Sarcocolla, Beuer cod, Aloe, Frankinsence, Opium, prepared Pearles, Camfere, of each a drag. temper this with the iuice of Celendine, make your hands fat with the oile of bitter almonds, and make trocisces thereof, the waight of halfe a dragme. Afterwardes dissolue one of them in Fennell water, and when you will vse it, put some therof into the eyes: it cleanseth them, and taketh away the skin from the eyes. Item make this powder following, which is good to take off the white skin when it is but new: the same is also good for running and sore eyes. Take Ginger, Pepper, Mirobalani Indi, and of the yellow Mirobalans, of each fiue drag. Aloes one drag. and a halfe, Cuttle bone three quarters of an ounce, Antimonie thrée drag. Cassia wood and Cloues, of each halfe an ounce: make all this vnto a subtill powder, & let it be blowne into the eyes. And if so be that these fore∣said things do not helpe, then must the skin be pluckt off; whereof it is not our meaning here to shew the manner. Vngula.Now as concerning the white skin of the eyes, which the Phisitions do call Vngulam, which is a naile; for that it is likened to a naile of the finger, which is of nature betwéene skinne and flesh, and groweth from the corner of the eye towards the middle of the same: Of these some be hard, and some be soft, yellowish, darkish and reddish, and haue some societie with the fore∣said Sebell, whereof some be light, and others very hardly cured by manuall operation. They do grow out of all corners and sides of the eyes, vntill that in part or in whole they couer the apple of the eye. The cause of this are many tough and thicke humors, like as one may sée in horses and foure footed beasts mo, which are fed with grosse food. Now what one is to beware of in this sicknesse, hath bene before beclared at large in the 12. §. For this (like as also in all other) is very good the letting of bloud and purging, with al other things which repell this defluxion, for the beginning of the cure, like as is sufficiently shewed in the former instructions. Now hencefoorth we will go and discourse of the smallest and newest skinnes. Take Mallowes, Cammomill, Hollihocke rootes, Lineseede, of each halfe a M. let it séethe well, and receiue the vapor into the eyes: afterwards vse the Collyrium which is described be∣fore in the eight §. and beginneth thus: Take beaten Bloudstone, &c. Item, take Ʋinum Punicinum, put a good deale of Rue therein, and let it stand in a glasse the whole Sommer in the Sun, drop thereof into the eyes. The same doth driue away the new skin, and all darknesse of the eyes. The iuice of Celendine, of Beetes, of Fennell, of Verueine, each a part or mixed, being put into the eyes, do take away the heate of the eyes, and all dark∣nesse of the same. Or take the flowers of Cicorie, as many as you will, put them into a glasse stopt, couer the glasse with thicke dow, put it then into an ouen. The water which runneth from these flowers, vse to the skin of the eyes. This also may be approoued: Take Iuniper leaues, and the berries that growe thereon: distill water thereof, and put it into the eyes. Item, take fine honie, bruise some Camfere amongst it and vse it as all the rest. Breake a fresh péece of Beuer cod in péeces, wherein you shall find some moisture: temper this with wine, and put it into the eyes. For this is also good, great Ants bruised in péeces, and made to pap with the fat of Quailes, Myrrhe, and Fennell water. Take sixe graines of Pepper, and as much Allume, vineger one ounce, seeth it vnto the third part, and kéepe it for daily vse. Take Grashoppers, but not the gréene, nor them that be big, nor too little: bind them on a thréed, and drie them in the Sunne, then beate them to powder, bind them in a cloth, and lay it all night in wine, drop thereof into the eye; it is very sharpe. Others do but make a cloth wet therein, and so lay it vpon the eye, and that is surer. Some do vse Elderne pith. Item take the innermost skinnes of the mawe of a Sparrow, halfe an ounce, Verbascum séeds thrée drag. beate them very smal, and make it into a salue with the oile of swéet Almonds: afterwards take Verdigrease, white Vitrioll, Salarmoniacke, burnt Copper, of each halfe a scrup. long, white, and black Pepper, gréene earthen potsheards, Sagapenum, Galbanum, of each one dragme, Bucks gals one quarter of an ounce: Powne very small what is to be powned,
temper them with some honie, and put of the iuice of Marioram or water vnto it, that thou maist vse it for a Collyrium. There may many be found wherein the venime Orpigmentum is put, the which I do not willingly rehearse; because that where any thicke and old skinne doth couer the eye, it is to be taken off with the néedle, so that it is vnnecessarie to vexe the eyes with any such perillous things. Of the mists and cloudes of the Eyes. §. 14. THe Nebula (which is also called by reason of her whitenesse Albugo) is diuers:Nebula. Albugo. it hath also other causes than the foresaid white eye skins. There be two sorts of these: the first is méetely thicke, like the white of a sodden egge to looke vnto: the other is much subtiller, and is like to a cloud, and it is also easier to cure than the other: both procéed through the defluxion of moi∣stures out of the head, and wil be according to the nature of that moisture, thick or subtill. There commeth also otherwhiles a third sort into the eyes, as of some kind of bruse, or old impostume, or of any blisters of the eyes, which are a long time in curing. Neuerthelesse it hath bene found, if young children through the pockes do retaine any such cloudes, and the eyes with the bodie be waxen greater; that the same clouds do lessen in time. The thicke whitenesse is thus to be cured: Euery morning fasting are the eyes to be fomented with cleare warme water, or with water of these herbes following, whereof we meane to vse the iuice: Take the iuice of corne Roses, the iuice of Centorie, temper them together, or vse each by it selfe. Item take the dried iuice of Celendine thrée dragm. Ameos one quarter of an ounce, make a powder thereof. Item take white Sugarcandie: each put apart in the eye, is very good. Take Pumicestone, prepared Sarcocolla, Aristologie, white Sugar, of each a like much: make a powder therof. Cuttle bones alone, or tempered with one of the foresaid, are also very profitable: womans milke after the foresaid bones, milkt in the eyes, and vsed often, mollifieth the white skins. This following is also highly commended: Take Pumicestones, Cuttle bones, prepared Sarcocolla, Aristologie, red Corall, Boreas, of each one drag. Sugarcandie thrée quarters of an ounce, make thereof a subtill powder. Take the burnt shels of Sea crabs, prepared Tutia, and Sugar: beate them as small as may be. Now to the end the eyes may be cleansed, and the clouds taken away, this ho∣ny following is to be put therein: Take clarified hony two ounces, the iuice of Centorie, the iuice of Fennell, of each an ounce and a halfe, let it séeth somewhat, and scum it till it be cleare: drop thereof on the white cloude of the eye. Will you haue the honie more sharpe? then put thereto thrée dragmes of Boreas. Take one part of Swallowes dung, Hony thrée parts, temper them together: this will ap∣parantly helpe, but it is sharpe like as is said alreadie. Dispersion, or contraction of the eye beames or sight. §. 15. BEcause that these parts or skinnes of the apples of the eye (called Ragodis and Ʋuea) are sometimes disgregated through inward and outward occasions, so that they be stretched out euen to the white of the eye, whereby the sight is not a little hurt: it is therefore first to be marked, whether this disease be from the natiuitie, or procéede of the great paine in the head, Cephalaea. If it be borne with one, there is then small hope to haue it cured: but if it be caused through any other occasions, as fals, blowes, thrusts, many humours that disperse themselues abroad, or of some former impostume that hath not long bene past, then it is still to be holpen: first, by letting of bloud in the head veine on the contrarie side where the disease is afterwards through purging with the pilles of Cochiae, and through a well gouerned diet. This is one of the best medicines, for it consumeth all humidities, not onely of the head but also of the whole bodie. Afterwards one may make a plaister for it with fine Bolus, Mirtle séed, of each half an ounce, Linséede beaten small two ounces, Rose water, and the iuice of Barberies: or take Night∣shade, Plantaine, the iuice of Housléeke, of each a like much, & lay it ouer the eyes with a cloth.
Item, wet a cloth in Rosewater wherein Tutia hath bene infused, and lay it ouer the eyes: for this is cauterization in the necke very much commended: but if this disgregation of the sight be small, then it will be easily cured with the Sieff of Gals, which herafter shal follow, which fore∣said Sieff of Gals, or de Fellibus is thus prepared. de Felli∣s.Take the Gals of these aforenamed beasts, to wit, of Cranes, Pickrels, Buckes, Hobbies, Sparhaukes, or of any other rauening birds whatsoeuer, of each two drag. and a halfe, Eu∣phorbium, Coloquint, Sagapenum, of each one drag. melt the gum, powne all that is to be pow∣ned, and temper it with the gals, and with two ounces of the iuice of Fennell, and vse it like any other Collyrium: It is also specially good for those that are purblind, whereof shall be here∣after spoken. But if the starre or beame of the eye be dispersed because it is hurt, there is then no great care to be taken, for the same is easily to be holpen: make this plaister following. Take beanes and Barly meale, of each one quarter of an ounce, oyle of Roses halfe an ounce, the yolke of an egge, temper it well with the iuice of Endiue, as much as is néedfull. Take Nightshade, Housléeke, and Rosewater, of each one ounce, and the white of an egge, make a cloth wet therein, and lay it vpon the eyes. For this is also good, the gall of a Bucke, ashes of the burnt head of a Magpie, of each a like quantitie, tempered with Honie and the iuice of Celendine, and so layed vpon the eye: this is commended for a very approoued re∣ceipt. And if so be that the apple of the eye be contracted and waxe smaller, it is then caused through drought; and although naturally the small apple of the eye be good, yet is the diminishing of the same very bad. For this are good moist meates to be vsed, to bath in swéet waters, to vse of∣tentimes womans milke, and drop of the foresaid mildest Collyrium into the eyes. Of the extuberation of the Eyes, as if they would fall out. §. 16. THis is caused through many occasions, as for that the head is full of humors, or that the eyes of themselues do swel through a ful bodie, & otherwhiles through wind, and otherwhiles through some kind of impostume, if there be much bloud or flegme with it, whereof mention is before made in the 8. §. It may happen also that the sinewes of the muscles about the eyes are féebled and lamed tho∣rough some superfluous humor of the head, like as it may well happē by reason of the great paine of the head through extreame vomiting, and strong straining of going to stoole, of hard coughing, and of such like strong motions: and this happeneth especially in the dropsie, if it come through fulnesse of the bodie, then doth the patient féele a strong pricking and paine about the eyes: if through wind, then is the pricking not so strong, but rather contracting: if it come through much bloud, that do the red veines declare, with heate, Cholera maketh pric∣king and smarting. If this infirmitie be new, then it is easily to be holpen (in case that it is not caused through the dropsie) and that onely through good gouernment of diet. But if this infir∣mitie be but small, then lay cotton on the eye, and tye it to a linnen band: eate and drinke but little, sléep much, and refraine from all labour. But if the griefe be much, and with great paine, open the head veine, and purge with Hiera and with Pils ordained in Ophthalmia. Set boxing cups with picking on high vpon the shoulders, foment the eyes with wooll which is dipped in warme vineger and water, or with water and vineger wherein Pomegranate blossomes and péeles, Gals, and Sumach is decocted, and make the whole face wet therewith. And if therwith be great heate, then make a plaister of the hearbe Shepheards purse, Plantaine, and Housléek, and so apply it vpon the eye. But if it procéed through weaknesse of the sinewes, then purge the head, vse Gargarismes, and the Salues that hereafter are taught in Paralysi and contraction of the mouth, make a fomentation of warme hearbes, or this plaister: take Frankinsence, Ma∣sticke, Cipers nuts, and the leaues of each a like much beaten, tempered with oyle of Cammo∣mill; but if you will put some of the iuice of Sloes vnto it you may.
Of eyes that be burnt. §. 17. IF any bodies face be burnt, so that one haue feare of his eyes, and that they do swell, then take water of Verueine, steepe Quince kernels therein, wring the slime through a cloth, and annoint the face therewith, and the eyelids: but looke for that which is writ∣ten before of white and red eyes, what cooleth all kinds of inflammations, or that is de∣clared in the first part. Whensoeuer any be stricken in or vpon the eye. §. 18. TAke powned Wormewood, temper it with the brayed white of an egge, and lay it ouer the eye. Item, take the iuice of Verueine, the white of egs well brayed, lay it on the eyes with a wet cloth: looke also thereof in the sixt Chapter and the first §. of the humors of the eyelids. If any thing be fallen into the eyes. §. 19. IF so be that the eye (through any thing that might fall therein) be bruised or perished, that must forthwith be holpen, to the end that it do not inueterate: for this it is aduised to take fresh cléere water in the mouth, and spout the same into the sore eye so long, vntill all that whatsoeuer be in it may be washed out. Yet womans milke is more commodious, sprouted into it out of the breast. This may also be done with white wine, for it causeth the eyes to run better; and if one wring thereon, then commeth that which is fallen into it with more ease out of it againe. Or take a péece of white Rosen, let it be made warme in the sunne, or after another maner, then draw it very softly on the apple of the eye, then doth it remaine hanging thereon. This operation or power is attributed also vnto Rubies & Saphires being stroked in the eyes. Roll the vpper eyelid about, and wipe it with a soft linnen cloth, then doth it remaine hang∣ing on the cloth. Item, take Betony, Celendine, Eyebright, Hyssope, Penniroyall, of each a like, séeth them in méely water, and wash the eyes with this whilest that it is warme. How to cure the diminishing, feeblenesse, and darknesse of the eyes. §. 20. THe sight is many times of some disease of the eyes (like as in Ophthalmia is de∣clared) lessened, and also enféebled, as the shining of the Sunne, looking glasses, shining copper, lightnings, fire, long darknesse, watching, the beholding of white things, like as when one walketh farre in the snow, cold ayre, or that chalke, dust, or any things else come into the eyes, through much looking vpon small things, to let much bloud, or that one doth it not if he be accustomed, also through an vnchast life. Further, the eyes are much weakened with great laskes, great labour, odoriferous things, and specially the Basilicon, of which we are not to omit this admirable work of nature, that is, if one eate too much of this, then will the sight be weakened, where notwith∣standing the iuice thereof dropt into the eyes doth strengthen the sight and drieth vp the moi∣sture. These patients must beware of all grosse meates, as chéese, old flesh, coleworts: also from o∣uermuch eating and drinking, and from fasting. Also all such diminishing of the sight is cau∣sed through great paine of the head, swimming and great heate, which drieth too much. Also through cold moistures, which obstructeth the sinewes of the sight. There are thrée kinds of the weaknesse of the sight, the first of all diminisheth, when a thing is seene vnperfect, and when it is thought to be lesse; the second kind is a spoyled or corrupted sight, whereas one séeth any thing otherwise then it is, like as happeneth in the disease Scotoma. Thirdly, it is a contracted
sight, when one can discerne nothing by the sight, like as in the blindnesse. For all these aforesaid infirmities, shall the patient first vse preparatiue potions, and purge with the pils Cochiae or Stomachicae, and also vse Clisters which draw all humors downewards. Fennell séed vsed in all meates is especiall good both before and after meate: then as it commonly hapneth, that the fée∣blenesse of the eyes do proceed of a bad full stomacke, which doth cause many bad vapors in the head; then do the ancient Phisitions aduise, that these sicke persons shall be caused to vomit, for that will drie and cleanse the stomacke from all bad corruptions and intolerable moistures. Also there be drying powders to be put into the eyes, whereof there be many before described. But if with this imperfection of the sight, there be an abatement or consumption of the body, like as one seeth in all those that recouer after a languishing sicknes, they must be fed with good meate, for that if one be fasting or hungry, the paine will be the greater and more forcible. Also he is to be let sleepe well, and giuen wine to drinke, to make the head oftentimes moist with warme water, or to bath: but beware that he sweate not too much. In the nose and eares is he to drop the oile of swéet Almonds, and besprinkle the eyes often∣times with yong womans milke. Hereafter do follow certaine medicins: first a gouernement of life, for that a good order of diet is no lesse of importance for this, then it is in any other sicknes. First of all one is aboue all the other foresaid things to abstaine from very cleere ayre, vnmeasurable Venery, reading smal prints or writings, &c. from going to sléepe with a full stomacke, from all salt and strong meates, from drunkennes, and all that replenisheth the head. If the cause be moisture, then is likewise to be feared bathing, much sléepe, letting blood, cupping, and vaporous meates, new Wine, Beanes, Pease, and other pottages, Lettice, Vineger, and Radishes, much fish, Peares, Apples, and all moist fruites, especially after meate. In like manner all moist, darke and mistie weather, smoke, wind, dust, moist dwellings, going idle, vnleauened bread, old and grosse flesh, and all that maketh grosse blood. On the contrary side, there be many commodious things that strengthen the weake sight, as the sight of gréene fields, trées, the precious stone Smaragdus, greene glasse, greene linnen, and such like more, which are to be set before our eyes, to the end it may thereby be quickned. In like manner also all blew colours, and all other orient colours, as to looke into a steele looking-glasse, in the cléere water, gold, the starres of heauen, the precious Saphir stone, flowers of Borage, of Eyebright, and specially of Larks spurres, which are chiefly commended. .The like operations are ascribed vnto the Wine and the conserue of Eyebright, and that not without reason, for that they be both forcible for to strengthen the sight, & to make it cleere and fresh, so that many old folkes through the vse of these haue continued and strengthened their sight with them. They do also deopilate the obstruction of the Milt and Liuer being dayly vsed, they cleanse the stomacke, and withstand all agues that proceed out of the stomacke: for what they serue else, and how they are to be prepared, the Register shal make mention. Therfore hath the wine of Eybright also, and the conserue of the same, not their names in vaine: for they haue like power in strengthening of the sight, to dry the moistnes of the braines, and to cléere all dark sights. Further, it is very commodious that one do kembe well once a day, especially ancient folkes: youths are to wash their eyes often with fresh water, also to suffer hunger and thirst somtimes, and to drinke swéet water. In like manner all that is meet for the strengthening of the memory, is also very fit for the sight, as hereafter shall be shewed: and all that is accounted good for the fiue senses, as the sight, the hearing, smelling, tasting and féeling. Cléere faire ayre is alwayes good, bread well raised, good wine soberly drunk, also light meates which fume not into the head. This is now sufficiently written of the order of dict. Now we will come to the medicines, and waters for the eyes.The water of the Emperor Frederick for  sight. Hereunder is one which was ordained and made for the Emperor Frede∣ricke the third, the which vnto this present day is very highly commended, and is thus prepa∣red: Take Betony, Rue, Verueine, Celendine, Eyebright, Roses, all of them gréene, of each sixe good handfuls, Aloe one ounce, long pepper, Cloues, of each halfe a drag. some also put thereto thrée handfuls of Woodbind and the flowers. This being all chopped, is to be distilled through a glasse helme: drop thereof into the eies, and annoint al the face therewith. Or take the iuice of Fennell and of Verueine, each by it selfe, or mixt amongst other, drop it into the eyes, lay it ouer them with a cloth, it taketh away the dimnesse. There is also described before in this Chapter
and first §.  water for the eyes, of Celendine decocted with hony, which is specially good for all darknesse of the eyes. Another. Take Fennell, Eyebright, and Rose water, of each one ounce, Sarcocolla, Tua both prepared, Sugarcandy, of each one scup. the gall of a Pickerell, fiue leaues of beaten gold: put these together in a glasse, and let it séeth a while in hot water in a glasse, and vse it as a Collyrium. This preserueth the sight maruellously. Item take Fenegreeke, Hollihock roots, of each two ounces, cleanse them well, and let them séeth well in cléere water with a mild fire vnto the halfe: wring them out hard and straine them through a cloth, tempered with Aloe, a quarter of an ounce, Sugarcandy or Sugar of Roses one ounce, straine it with the Rose water through a cloth, and let it seeth together vnto a sirupe: preserue it stopt close in a glasse, and vse it as other eye-waters. Take prepared Tutia one drag. white Amber halfe a dragme, Camfere halfe so much, fennell water and Rose water, of each two ounces, temper them together. The water that is gathered of the vapor of hote bread maruellously cléereth dim eyes: Take Rose water as much as you please, Sugarcandy as much also; let it stand before that you vse it a certaine time in the Sunne. All gals of rauening birds, as also of Partridges, of Buls, Hares, Wolues, Foxes, and aboue all the Buckes gall doth drie the eyes and sharpen the sight. But one of these or more must be decocted with much iuice of fennell and clarified hony (once as much more as the other) and dropt into the eyes. Take the gals of Partridges, Balsam oyle, of each one quarter of an ounce, the iuice of Celendine one dragme, temper and vse them as the other. The auncient Phisitions haue highly praised this following: Take the iuice of Pomegranates which be neither lower nor swéet, two ounces: seeth them in a siluer vessell vnto the halfe: then adde clarified hony one ounce, let it boile well, straine it through a cloth, let it stand certaine dayes in the sunne, and drop it into the eyes. Item the iuice of sower and swéet Pomegranates, of each two ounces, set it in the Sun two moneths, then straine it, and temper thereto one drag. of Aloes, long pepper halfe a drag. And if you desire it to be more drying and biting, put thereto one scrup. of Sal Armoniack: the older this is, the better. Hereafter follow certaine simples which strengthen the sight, as the iuice of rosted Onions tempered with hony dropt into the eyes, the braines of flitter mice or Bats tempered with hony and dropt therein, the ashes of the same blowne into the eyes especially in the beginning. Rue hath an especiall propertie in the eyes, is good eaten, and the iuice of it tempered with the iuice of fennell and hony dropt into them. Hyssope vsed in meate is also very meet for the sight, Rapes and sodden yong Doues are very good, also their broth drunken: so are also Swallowes & Mag∣pies eaten, good for the strengthening of the sight, and the ashes of them tempered with hony and put into the eyes; Calmus raw and confected is very méet; burnt Corall drieth and consu∣meth all moisture of the eyes: Acatia strengtheneth and sharpeneth the sight, and expelleth the rednesse; Almonds are also very good. All odoriferous herbes, as Lauander, Rosemary, Gillo∣flowers, Roses, and all pleasant smelling fruites, are good for the eyes. Pomanders. Take Rosemary, Nep, Marioram, Penniroyall, of each one drag.Pomanders fit for a bad sight. Lignum A∣loes, Marioram gentle, and Mace, of each one quarter of an ounce, Muscus, Ambra, of each two graines, make thereof a powder, bind it in a peece of red silk, and smell oftentimes to it. They may also vse the same which haue the disease of the Cataract, whereof is much admonished before. The ancient Phisitions were of opinion, if one annointed oftentimes the eylids with Coral, precious stones and gold, or did behold them, that it were to strengthen and cléere the sight. This powder following of Rasis is much commended for to strengthen the sight therewith: Take prepared Tutia ten drag. make this to paste with the fresh iuice of Marioram gentle when it hath stood a night and be well setled: afterwards let it dry wel, beate it againe and put Ginger vnto it, long and black pepper, and Celendine, of each a drag. Sal Armoniack half a drag. al bea∣ten small, and maide moist with the cléere iuice of fennell: Let it dry againe, and so preserue it. When you will occupy it, then beate it vnto an impalpable powder, and put it into the eye. This powder following is to be strewed vpon the head: Take Cloues, Liguum Aloes, Beto∣nica, Sandaraca, burnt Iuory, Styrax Calamita, of each halfe a drag. make thereof a powder, strew all the head therewith. As oftentimes as you will vse it, then kembe the head before, to the end the first may come off, afterwards vse twise a moneth when you go to sleepe one quarter of an
ounce of the trocisces of Diambra, hold them long in the mouth vntill they do melt. Item take Cumin which is stéeped one night in vineger, and afterwards dried, Annis séeds, prepared Coriander, of each three ounces, Fennell séed sixe ounces: temper them all together. You may also let them be confited with Sugar, and vse it after meate: this strengtheneth the stomacke, stayeth the vapors from gathering vpwards toward the head, and consumeth al cold matter in the stomacke and the head. A powder to be vsed with meate. TAke Siluer mountaine, Ginger, Cucubes, Cloues, long pepper, Nutmegs, the rootes of Celendine, Diptamer rootes, of each halfe an ounce, prepared Cumine, Fennell séed, Annise seeds, flowers of Eyebright with the leaues, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, prepared Coriander one quarter of an ounce, Sugar as much as you please: this is to be bea∣ten small together and vsed dayly in meate; it strengtheneth the sight, and defendeth against blindnesse. This following is also to be obserued for a speciall meane, that one must gargarise euery ten dayes: two dayes together in the morning and euening eight or ten times together. Take Mar∣ierom gentle, one handfull, Licorice halfe an ounce, seeth them in a pint of water vnto the halfe: take a good cruse full thereof, temper amongst it one dragme and a halfe of Hiera Picra: gargarise with it (as is said) it is very requisite, but bitter. After supper take one of these Tabulates: Take Spec Diambrae one dragme and a halfe, Eye∣bright, Celendine, Fennell, Verueine, of each one scrup. the seed of Rue, of Siluer mountaine, of each halfe a drag. Sugar fiue ounces: séeth all these with Eyebright water, and cast Tabu∣lates of it. Lastly, take Rue, Celendine, Eyebright water, of each two ounces, Fennel and the iuice of Verueine, of each one ounce, the gall of a Pickerell thrée drag. Lignum Aloes beaten smal halfe a drag. the séed of Rue, of Celendine, Marioram gentle, of each one dragme, temper them with the foresaid water, stop it tight in a glasse, and sement it with dow: afterwards set it in an ouen when the bread is taken out, and let it stand a whole day therein. The next day take of the dow againe, and set it the space of twelue days in the Sunne; afterwards straine it through a tight cloth, but wring it not out, and kéepe it in a stopt glasse, whereof put euery morning and euening one drop in the eye, and lie vpon your backe, then shall you perceiue an apparant a∣mendment of the sight. Pillule, Pilles. TAke white beaten Eyebright half an ounce, Caroway sodden in vineger and dried, Mar∣ioram gentle thrée quarters of an ounce: Lignum Aloes, Indie Spica, of each one ounce, the séeds of Sorrell fiue scrup. temper them with the Iulep of Roses, whereof you are to take at one time a halfe or a whole drag. once in thrée or foure dayes in the euening when you go to bed. Will you then make a powder thereof? put thereto prepared Coriander, Cinnamom and Fennell, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar as much as you please. This may you take af∣ter supper. The con∣ction of Mon∣tagnana for a bad sight.This following is a costly confection, and strengtheneth the sight, therefore it is called of Mon∣tagnana, Electuarium Occulistae, because it is very profitable for the abating of the sight which pro∣ceedeth through flegmaticall humors; for besides that it strengtheneth the braines, it restoreth the lost sight againe, and maketh also the spirits of the sight subtiller and stronger. Take Siluer mountaine séed, Eyebright, fennell, and Cucubes, of each a drag. Cardamome, Mace, of each one drag. and a half, the séed of Celendine, of Rue, of each one quarter of an ounce, Rosemary one ounce, Annis séed, Lignum Aloes, Caroway, Consolida Sarracenica, of each halfe an ounce, sugar or hony as much as is néedfull for to make thereof a confection. Another. TAke dried Betony, Celendine, Eyebright, Hyssope, Penniroyall, of each one drag. fennell, Siluer mountaine, Annis, prepared Coriander and Marioram gentle seeds, Basill séeds,
Cardamome, Cinnamom, Ginger, Galingale, Nutmegs, Cloues, long Pepper, Lignum Aloes, Masticke, Spikenard, of each halfe a drag. preserued Citron pils thrée drag. conserues of Bo∣rage, of Rosemarie, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar decocted in Fennell and Rosewater as much as is néedfull for to make a confection. This patient shall take also after purging the second or third day one drag. of Treacle, Aurea Alexandrina, or Mithridate. Or make a potion: Take halfe a dragm. of Treacle, breake it in wine, water of Rue or Fennell, and take it once euery wéeke: yet this is best of all that one may vse for a weake sight, preserued Chebuli eaten fasting doth much strengthen the sight; some chew euery morning Iuniper berries, spetting it afterwards into the hands, and letting the fume go into the eyes: the which can also streng∣then the sight much. The same vertue hath also chewed Annis, Cumine, and especially Fen∣nell séede, whether they be confected or no. All later and auncient writers do commend this remedie following, as well for the streng∣thening of the sight, as for those that be purblind: Take the liuer of a Bucke, take off the Gall, cut broad peeces out of it, lay therein whole long Pepper, couer it with another peece of liuer and Pepper as before, thus continuing till all the péeces be laid one vpon another, so that aboue and beneath be nothing but liuer. Put this then into an ouen, and drie it well away: then take of the Pepper, beate it small, and mixe some Muscus amongst it, and with the moisture which droppeth from the liuer, moisten therewith the powder, and make losinges thereof, preserue it vntill you haue néede of it, then temper it with Eyebright water, or such like, and vse it as the other. To these spices of medicines are thrée kinds of commodities ascribed: the first to drop fat∣nesse into the eyes: the second to receiue the warme vapour into the eyes: thirdly, that the pa∣tient eate thereof many times a yeare, euery time three daies together. One more (which is almost like vnto it) doth hereafter follow: Rost a hogs Liuer, wet the eyes with the dampe of this rostmeate, and rub the fatnesse on the eyelids. Take a slip of Rue, drinke the infusion of it at your meale, it is also very good for this. Take Cinnamom, Cloues, Mace, of each a like much, powre Malmesey vpon it, and vse it as you please. When one hath then vsed a good deale of these foresaid things, and there be yet perceiued much more moisture in the eyes: there is sometimes to be vsed for to drie the braines of this iuice following, drawing it vp through the nose, to wit, of Marioram gentle and Dane wéede. There are also twise a wéeke two of these pils following to be taken after supper: Take Pa∣ula lucis, Rubarbe, of each one scrup. and a halfe, and make thereof fiue or seuen pils. Of all those that after the rising of the Sunne, do see nothing at all, or very badly. §. 21. THis infirmitie of the sight is of two kinds. The first is when one can sée well in the day time, but against the euening and night can sée nothing or very badly. The o∣ther to the contrarie, when one in the day time doth sée little or badly, moouing the eyes vp and downe, when he doth come into the clearenesse, without holding them open, therefore be they commonly called in Dutch blind Cats: but when it groweth towardes euening, then begin they to amend, and can sée much better. Both these infirmities do procéed of like causes, and according as the spirits of the sight be formed, whereof the Philosophers do dispute much. The Grecians do call them Nyctilopas, the Latinists Lusciosos, in English pur∣blind, whereof Galenus speaketh generally, that it is a disease which procéedeth of no manifest cause. Others write, that it is incident rather to blacke eyes then to other: what concerneth the signes, they are to be inquired of them that haue this infirmitie. First, for this is reputed good, if the partie be full of bloud, that first of al the head veine, after∣wards the veines in the corners of the eyes be opened: others do aduise to open the median and the veine in the forehead. Afterwards whether it be of a Phlegma or Melancholia, purge with the pils Cochiae or Lucis, and then to take Mithridate or Treacle. In the eye is to be vsed the fat of the Bucks liuer (described before) or to temper it with a little of the Bucks gall, or the Buckes gall alone decocted with a little vineger, applied likewise as aforesaid: for in this disease is most of all commended that which commeth from the Bucke or Goate. Plini admonisheth that some haue aduised, that one should wrap the Goates dung with waxe, and so swallow it down.
He writeth also that this blindnesse is to be holpen with Goats bloud, & it may come thereby, for that it is sayd that those beasts do see as well by night as by day: therefore it was comman∣ded to Nycripolis to eate the Buckes and Goats liuer rosted. And how the same shall be drest is shortly before declared, where we haue discoursed of the diminished and weake sight. When one is waxed almost blind. §. 22. IF there fall any moysture in the eyes which maketh one almost starke blind, then it is found out by experience, that the decoction of a Viper, the head and tayle chopt off, hath holpen (yet the intrailes pluckt out and stuffed with Fennell séedes) like as also helpeth if one eate the flesh of this Serpent boyled. This is reported of the nature of the Viper snake. The like vertue also hath the decoction of Guaiacum vsed after his manner or kind, the which is not onely méete for this, but also in certaine confections for the sight, which Pope Innocentius the third did send to an Abbot, who was almost blind, and is made thus: Take Fennell séede halfe a pound, Siluermountaine seede, and blew Chamedris, of each foure ounces, Smallage, Annis, Parsly séedes, Peniroyall, Hyssope, Saxifrage, Iuniper berries, of each one dragme, the séede of Stauesacre two ounces: this being beaten small with Hony or Sugar, and a confection made thereof, and vse thereof morning and euening, and you shall sée maruels. Commeth the cause of the hinderance in sight through obstructions of the sinewes whereby the sight commeth into the eyes? then vse the Pils Cochiae and Lucis of each half a dragme, make 7. or 8. pils therof, swallow them in the morning betimes and fast fiue houres vpon it, vse them once euery moneth. Afterwards vse this confection, take Peniroyall, Rue, Betony, Celendine, of each one handful, Saxifrage, Louage, Annis, Cammomil, Ginger, Fennell, Parsly, Hyssop, Marioram, Siluermountaine, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Gallingall halfe an ounce, powne all very small that is to be powned, and temper it with Sugar which is clarified in Fen∣nell water, it requireth halfe a pound of Sugar at the least, cast Tabulates of it, and then lay them vpon the tong, and let them melt of themselues: this do and continue it the space of two or thrée monthes, all after that the blindnesse is great and hath long continued. Of Squintnesse. §. 23. THis is a distractiō of the eyes out of their naturall places towards the right or left side, vpwards or downewards: the occasion of this is sometimes through resolu∣tion of the sinewes, where the whole place doth draw that infirmed vnto it. Also it may be a crampe in the same sinewes, whereto the cōtrary the shrinking sinewes do draw the whole vnto them; it cometh also very well through a custome, when yong children in the cradle do lye alwaies vpon one side, & open but one eye: but if the squintnes do come through slacknesse of the sinewes or the crampe, that is séene and shewed by the signes which are described in Paralysi, or in the crampe. This disease could the auncient Phisitians heale very badly, and it is very vncertaine in yong children, neuerthelesse we will not preter∣mit to shew our aduise for it: on the side where the disease is put some clearenesse, to the end the eye may be drawne to his naturall place: also when it is caried about on the arme, the aun∣cient Phisitions haue vsed all those things which were wont in Paralysi and in the distraction of the mouth to be adhibited. Hydromell, honie water: how to make and vse the same. §. 24. IT is before oftentimes mentioned, and therefore it is very worthy for to describe here how to make it: The ancient Phisitions tooke raine water and hony decocted therewith, scum∣ming it well, and vsing it for a common drinke, in the stead of water or wine, like as also it standeth discouered in many places of this booke; now it is for the most part made with well water and hony. In fine, Hydromell is no other thing but our common meade without any ad∣dition: of other sorts of meade is spoken hereafter in the eight part.
The eight Chapter. Of the Nose. THis is also one of the principallest outward members of the face, artifici∣ally conioyned of sinewes and gristles, and by nature ordained for many kind of vses: for who knoweth not how excéeding needfull it is for the life, and for preseruation of the good breath, and for discerning of al smels & sauors: in behalfe of both these two causes is the Nose set in the height of the bodie, and endued with such a propertie that it might refresh and coole the hart, the lights and all inward parts with continuall breathing, without the which no man liueth. Besides this it hath power to discerne and iudge the sauor of the meate: it is set besides and aboue the mouth, to the end it might adiudge and giue euidence to all before it goeth into the mouth, what is pleasant and what is to be eschewed, or is necessarie or hurtfull: it standeth also in the middest of the face not onely for a garnishing, but also for a stay or defence betwéene both the eyes for to defend them (as hath bene said before.) It is also a right pipe or gutter to purge and cleanse thereby all the moisture of the braines and the head; to the end there should nothing fall downe vpon the breast or other principal parts that might there cause great sicknesse. This member is subiect also to many kind of diseases, as Impostumes, Obstructions, Rheumes, ex∣cessiue bléeding, losse of smelling, of all which and others mo, shall be hereafter spoken. Of Obstruction or stopping in the Nose. §. 1. THis infirmitie is caused through inward or outward occasions: If the nose be stopt tho∣row falling, striking, or thrusting; then must it swell: if it be then swolen, then be the waies thorough which the breath and smell commeth stopped: yea also the smell other∣whiles wholy lost. It may also be well stopped through some grosse moisture, that falleth out of the head and braines, which cannot passe thorough the nose, for that the nose vents are thereby stopped. As much as then concerneth any outward brusing, there must be salues and plasters laid vpon it, like as vpon other tumors. The same being healed, the vents and pores will be o∣pen againe, and the smelling restored, yet it is alwaies good aduice to set boxing cups vpon the necke and shoulders, and to lay vpon the brest brayed whites of egges, tempered with some Camfere. But of this stopping shall be spoken more at large hereafter, especially in the losse of the smelling. Of the Vlcers in the nose. §. 2. THese impostumations do the Writers diuide into Vlcera & Apostemata, which we do english, Vlcers and Impostumes; the Vlcers are alwaies drie or moist: drie when they make hard scurse, and contrarily when they yeeld out much moisture, like as if the nose were rubbed on the inside and thereby bled, and yeelded yellow, gréene or blacke matter; both procéeding of sharpe, salt, and burnt matter that des∣cendeth out of the head into the nose. The signes thereof may one easily discerne: if there be paine in the nose, then is to be séene against the bright Sunne where the disease is. For this ac∣cident the patient is to be purged with the Pils Cochiae, or Hiera, and such like. This is also a common rule in the curing of all Vlcers, to wit: that it be begun with no strong medicine, or that the partie be purged before. Like as for example, if the patient be plethoricke in bodie, and the vlcer be great, open the Median, and let out foure or fiue ounces of bloud according to the strength of the patient: but if the disease be not so great, then open the head veine vpon the arme or vpon the hand, at all times vpon that side where the disease is not, and somtimes very well in the veines of the nose. In like manner also are cups to be set in the necke, thereby to se∣duce the matter. This being done, the patient is to vse the space of eight dayes or sixe dayes this preparatiue potion: take Oxysacchara (which shall be immediatly hereafter described) the sirupe
of water Lillies of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Sorrell water, and Fennell water, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, drinke it lukewarme in the morning. The purgation vpon it is this. Take halfe an ounce of the confection De succo Rosarum, Cassia prepared with the water of Violets one ounce, temper all together with thrée ounces of Barly water méetly warme▪ for o∣therwise it is too thicke. Immediatly after purging lay this plaister following vpon the nose, that it may be couered euery where with it: Take small Housléeke, and the iuice of Plantaine, the iuice of shepheards purse, of each one ounce, the whites of two egges, Camfere brused small foure scrup. prepared Tutia, and Butchers broomeséedes of each one drag. burnt Corall and Am∣ber of each two scrup. Starch one ounce and a half, bruse these together in a leaden mortar some houres together, this is to be vsed thrée or foure times a day. Another. PVt the iuice of Tassell leaues thrée or foure times a day into the nose, it may be drawne vp into the nose: but if you feare that it will coole too much, then temper the third part of the iuice of Betonie amongst it. Oxysacchara. THis kind of Sirupe may easily be made by all housekéepers, it hath also great vertue and operation, for it doth consume the mixed and flegmaticke humidities which do pinch or annoy the vppermost parts, and cause the vnruly double Tertian and quar∣taine Agues: Take sixe ounces of white Sugar, the iuice of Pomegranates foure ounces, sharpe Vineger two ounces: seeth them in a little pot by a mild fire, vntill they be of the thicknesse of a common Sirupe. Item, if there be scurfe in the nose: Then take Sallad oile, the grease of a Capon as much as you please, and powre a little molten waxe amongst it, and annoint therewith the scurfs: like∣wise take warme water, draw it vp into the nose certaine dayes together, in the morning it is also good. Item, take the gum of a Cherrie trée, the gum of a Palme trée or Dragagant, dissolue them in Rosewater which thou wilt, annoint the Muscilage or slime in the nose with a feather. Or take the marrow of an Oxe bone, new waxe, of each half an ounce, oile of water Lillies one quarter of an ounce, melt and vse it as before. Or you must in stead of the oile of water Lillies, take also the oile of Roses. Another: Take Dragagant and the séede of Fleawoort, stéepe them in Rosewater and cile of Violets, annoint the nose oftentimes with this muscilage. You may also make this salue: Take Duckes and Hens grease, the fatnesse of Shéepes wooll, Harts sewet, honie, of each halfe an ounce, burnt Mirobalans, Gals, of each a drag temper them together. This asswageth and drieth much. In like manner this salue following is very conuenient: Take oile of swéet Almonds one ounce, oile of Roses one ounce, washt Butter, Hens grease, the Muscilage of Dragagant, of each one quarter of an ounce, and a little waxe. Or take fresh marrow out of the Calues bones, and gum, of each one quarter of an ounce, oile of white Camelina one ounce and a halfe, waxe as much as is néedfull. The same doth also butter washt wel with faire water, likewise also decocted Hollihocks, Nightshade or Malows. Another, almost as the former. Take the marrow of Calues bones, the yolks of egs, Draga∣gant and gum, of each one quarter of an ounce, oile of Camelina one drag. and a litle waxe. But if the impostume onely beginneth to run: then dip Cotton in strong and well salted vineger, put it into his nostrils, herewith they will be dried. But this following is better: Take prepared Tutia which is slaked in the vrine of a man child of two yeares old, and Ceruse, of each two drag. and a halfe, the iuice of Housleeke fiue ounces: rub this at the least the space of thrée dayes together, the space of thrée howers euery day in a leaden mortar, set it afterwardes well stopt in the Sun when it is too drie: then powre againe other iuice vnto it, and bruise it as before: do this so thrée or foure times together: with this salue are you to annoint the disease thrée or foure times a day. This salue is so forcible, that many people which haue had the can∣ker and Polypum,Canker Poly∣pus. thereby haue preserued their life a long time.
And if so be (through the great vncleanesse of this vlcer) there behooueth stronger things, and the disease be also old: then make first of all the scurfes moist with wine, wherein Agrimonie, Verueine and honie is decocted, drie it and make it moist again, afterwards vse this following: Take Vitrioll, red and yellow Orpiment, of each halfe a drag. beate and steepe it in the gall of a Bull or Oxe, and refresh it daily vntill the matter be white; then put thereto Antimonie and Myrrhe, of each one quarter of an ounce, Waxe as much as will make an ointment, annoint therewithall, and stop it in the nose: if you will haue this somewhat milder, then put thereto beaten Horsemints and Mallowes, to the quantitie of one quarter of an ounce. This that fol∣loweth is not so strong. Take Cypers rootes, Allume, Gals, Myrrhe, Saffron, of each one quarter of an ounce, beate them to powder, and blow it into the nose. Or make thereof a salue with honie. Also you may vse the salue Ʋnguentum Apostolicum, the which is made thus: Take Turpentine, white waxe,Vnquentum. Apostolicum. white Rosen, Ammoniacum, of each one drag. Opopanacum, Verdigrease, of each halfe a drag. the Litharge of gold two scrup. sallad oile sixe ounces in the Somer, but in the winter nine ounces, vineger as much as is néedfull for to dissolue the Gum with it, make a salue thereof. This salue is common at the Apothecaries, and is not onely good for this, but also for all sore eyes, Fistu∣laes, for cleansing the wounds, wherein it hath a maruellous operation: for it consumeth the bad flesh, incarnateth afterwards, and healeth all hard swellings: so that there is not almost the like vnto this. Item take burnt lead well washt, Ceruse, Litharge of gold, of each a like quantitie, oyle of Roses, and Waxe as much as is néedfull for a salue. This also following is much commended and is certaine: take one sower Pomegranat, others take sower, meane, and swéet Pomegra∣nates, of each one stamped with their pils, wrung out and decocted a while in a litle pot and cla∣rified, dip a taint in it and put vp into the nose; but if there be any vlcers with it, then vse this following. Take Ceruse, Myrrhe, Litharge of gold, burnt Copper, Gals that are parched a little, Allume, of each one drag. oile of Roses thrée ounces, Waxe as much as is needfull for a salue: this healeth and drieth. Item take Ceruse one ounce and a halfe, calcined and washed Ceruse, Litharge, of each halfe a drag. Vineger, Waxe, of each one spoonefull: make it with oile of Mirtles vnto a salue, wash the nostrils with warme wine and pisse, wherein Myrrhe and Frankinsence is decocted. And if this vlcer will not be healed with the foresaid things, it is then to be taken for a secret Canker, which one may not touch with sharpe things; as present∣ly hereafter shall appeare. Obstruction or stopping in Childrens noses without any other infirmitie. §. 3. IT happeneth oftentimes, that young, yea new borne children do suffer great stop∣ping in the nose: their breasts must be annointed well with the oiles of sweete Al∣monds, and of Violets, and to them that giue sucke wine is forbidden. And if the childrens breast be full, then is the oile of Violets with Sugar to be put into the mouth. Ancient folkes (if they cannot abide the oile of Violets by reason of the smell) then take sallad oile, or oyle of swéet Almonds in stead thereof. Impostumations of the Nose. §. 4. THe second kind of exulcerations in the nose are much more perillous and worse, and are called Apostemata, Hemorrhoides, Polypus Canker. The first is a soft excrescence of flesh, which giueth moisture when one wrin∣geth the nose; soft in féeling, and bléeding quickly: this procéedeth of moist wa∣ter which falleth out of the brains, rotteth there, and degenerateth into the flesh, the which otherwhiles groweth out so long that it hangeth without the nose: it taketh away the spéech, the breath, and also the smelling, somtimes shewing red and somtimes white and blackish. But the Polipus is hardish, hath many rootes and veines: he is so called af∣ter the name of a fish which hath many féete: and for many moe similitudes and properties that are betwéene them. This is caused of melancholicke humors tempered with slime or Phlegma, &
stoppeth the nose through his increase. This Canker is wholly hard and fast: it manifesteth himselfe also on the outside vpon the nose, with many blacke veines of melancholick bloud, whence this sore taketh his ofspring, and doth bring with it an intollerable stench (which the Phisitians do call Ozenam.) The cause of these tumours is the affluence of bad humours: but that which causeth Hemorhoides is a sweete Phlegma, which is without bloud but rotten, very moyst without paine, therfore is better to be healed then this following. But in Polypo is corrupted bloud, whereto doth come a stinking Phlegma. The Canker is a burnt, rotten, and hardened Melancholia. Both these last are vncertaine, yea wholly impossible to be holpen: neuerthelesse there be many kinds of remedies ordained and v∣sed as followeth. When as then the first sort doth appeare with softened or white flesh which filleth the whole nose, then is the head veine first to be opened; afterwards a taint annointed with this salue following, to be put into the nostrels where the disease is. Take yellow Orpiment, Coperas, Verdigreace, of each halfe an ounce, Quicksiluer, Salarmoniacke of each one ounce; bruse these small, and cast it into lime ley: this may you vse so: or make it with hony vnto a salue. Others do vse this sharpe water following: Take yellow Orpiment, quicke Lime, Verdigreace, Quick∣siluer, of each one ounce and a halfe, Salarmoniacke halfe a dragme; beate them cleane, and let it séeth well in water: when it hath stood a while, then will it be very sharpe. In like manner, getteth also a corroding qualitie, the water wherin quicke lime is quenched, and wherin quick∣siluer is put. This is more gentle, take Allume, Verdigreace, of each halfe an ounce, yellow Orpiment one scruple, temper them, and stick a taint in Vineger, sprinkle it with this powder and so sticke it in the nose where the disease is. Of the meane Corsiues is also taken for an approued thing, powned Vitrioll blowne into the nose in the morning and euening. There is also described in this Chapter in the 2. §. a medicine with the iuice of Pomegranats, which are especially good for this, amongst which you are to temper a litle Antimonie and Verdigreace. But if this will not helpe, then are stronger things to be vsed, as an actuall cauterie or incision, & although this do seldome prosper, neuerthelesse we will discourse somewhat thereof. For this soft excrescence of flesh whereof we haue spoken at the first is not wholly incurable, but may through these meanes be cured, which neuertheles is very vnpossible in the Canker: but if it were found that there ought to be vsed either the actual cauterie or incision, then must the cauterized place be an∣nointed with fresh butter, & the brayed white of an eg, and couer the nose and the whole face with vineger & water, or Rose water, or take the yolks of an eg, temper it with oyle of Roses, and the iuice of Roses, this swageth almost all the paine of the Cauterie. Here do now follow certaine sharpe, yet good meanes, which are most surest in greatest ne∣cessitie, the first is, that these superfluous excrescences be clipt off with a sharpe payre of Cisors euen to the bottome, afterwards take away the rest that remaineth behind with this salue fol∣lowing: Take one ounce of hony, vineger one quarter of an ounce, Sarcocolla, Ammoniacum, of each halfe an ounce, séeth these vpon a mild fire, and therewith annoint your taints which you thrust into the nose, it hath a speciall vertue of healing and drying. The other meanes, if this were not sufficient, then burne the disease with an iron that is flat before, thrust it through a copper pipe which is wrapt in clothes wet in Rose water, to the end that the sound part of the nose be not burnt, do this so long vntill one can perceiue no remanence of it more. Afterwards annoint the cauterized place with butter, vntill that the escarre falleth off, & heale it with Ba∣sill and the ointment of Ceruse, or with the salue that is described in the 2. §. in the vlcers of the nose with Tutia. The third meane to expel this accident: Take a long and strong horse haire, thrust it into the nose vntill you bring it out of the mouth againe: fasten it on both ends and plucke it hither∣wards ouer the accident, and that so often times til it be cut out at the bottome. This being ac∣complished, stanch the bloud with this powder, take Mirrhe, Sarcocolla, fine Bolus, Dragon bloud, of each one dragme, prepared Tutia halfe a dragme, this powder must be blowne in the place where it bléedeth, or strew a taint with it and stop it into the nose; now the bloud being stanched, heale it with the foresayd salue.
Of the Canker in the Nose. §. 5. THe causes of this Canker in the nose, and the signes thereof are discouered before. First, it sheweth it selfe small like a corne of wheate, but afterwards will be as big as a hazle nut or almond: it yéeldeth seldome matter, and remaineth alwayes (as is said) hard and dry: it will abide no strong things, as actuall or potentiall cauteries, but it must be softly medled with, and easie remedies vsed thereto, as to let blood, laxatiue things, and Master Tristrams water, which is described in the fift chapter and first §. Also oile of blew Flowerdeluce annointed thereon, and chiefly Treacle and Mithridate thrust into the nostrils, and to hold the same in the mouth & eate it. Also it is very good to purge the head with this potion: Take Mirobalani Indi one ounce and a halfe, Sene, Epithymum, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugarcandy foure ounces, séeth them together in nine ounces of water euen to the halfe, straine it then through a cloth, and temper it with Manna and sower Dates a∣mongst it, of each one ounce. In like sort may one purge also with the Pillulis foetidis or Sioma∣chicis. The place of the accident is also to be twise a day at the least strengthened with the oile of Roses wherein Camfere is tempered, and lay a cloth therein dipped in them, or made as it were into a salue, and annointed therewithall. Yet in stéed of this he may vse the iuice of Nightshade. The patient must much beware of all pottages, chéese, hard flesh, and all which ingendreth me∣lancholike blood: but must vse drying meates. His drinke must be wine tempered with water. For the defluxion Ozena, which the Canker bringeth with it, is this following very meet:Oza. Take one ounce and a halfe of oile of Roses, halfe an ounce of white Waxe, a little vineger, and the brayed white of an egge, milke one ounce, washed Ceruse one quarter of an ounce, the iuice of Lettice, of Plantaine, of Nightshade, of each halfe an ounce, stir them together the space of two or three houres in a Leaden morter. Of the Murre. §. 6. WE haue taught in the description of the Nose, that it is by nature ordained for a channel, thereby to cleanse the moisture of the head and of the braines, like as is brought to passe through this course of the Murre, the which the Grecians do call Catarrhum, especially this murre which falleth downe into the nose, do they call Coryzam: of the other two kinds, whence commeth so much badnes, which be salt catarrhes or rheumes, which descend into the throte and vpon the brest, shall be taught at large in their places. We will onely here now discourse of all those maladies that concerne the nose: that this course or running procéedeth out of heate and cold, which is Cholera and Phlegma, that shall be shewed at large in the discourse of the paine in the throte in the second part, where is spoken of the catarrhe or rheume. Here is no other thing discouered but onely of the murre, how that that is most caused when one commeth suddenly out of great warmth into cold; and to the contrary, out of great cold speedily into warmth: like as when one runneth bare headed out of the bath into the wind; or as one runneth out of the great cold into the warme stew: and this is also the cause wherefore the people for the most part in the latter end of winter or summer are plagued therewith. Now when this murre or sniuell is salt and biting, then doth it soone cause these accidents, Ozena, Cancer or Polypus▪ therefore the sniuel is not to be estéemed so smal, but rather endeuor by and by to prouoke and moue this defluxion, to the end the matter may be caried out, whereto this fume following is conuenient: Take Cloues, Myrrhe, Frankinsence; odoriferous fruites and herbes, as Quinces and their parings, Rue, Marioram gentle, and such like. Lotions for the feete are also very fit for this purpose, like as followeth: Take Sage, Lauander, Betony, field mints, or any other, thrée or foure handfuls, séeth them in water, and put the féet therein, vse it oftentimes, and méetly deepe. The cleansing of the head. IN all the former cases, the most principall remedy was alwayes to cleanse the head and the braines, whereto this water following is very good: Take foure ounces of the iuice of wild
Cucumbers, Salarmoniacke powned small, halfe an ounce tempered in a glasse, and fill it halfe ful with water, stir it oftentimes about, and snuffe it vp into the nose in the morning fasting fiue or sixe times together warme, and do this alwayes about the second day. This openeth all ob∣structions that hinder smelling, whether it be in impostumes or vlcers of the nose: it draweth also the matter out and consumeth it, and it strengtheneth all the instruments that are created for smelling. Item take the iuice of Marioram and Penniroyall, of each one ounce, Muscus two graines, vse it as before. Make also this powder following: Take Penniroyall, Marioram and Nep, of each one drag. Graines thrée drag. powne all and bind them in a fine cloth, and smel oftentimes to it. Take oile of Violets, oile of Saffron, of each thrée drag. Ireos, long Pepper, Euphorbium, of each two graines, make a salue thereof with a little waxe, whereof you shall take the quantity of a pease, and annoint it in the nose when you go to bed, it purgeth and clenseth the braines. Some do vse Hellebore or Pepper for the nose, but it is not without danger, for it troubleth too much the braines: but how and through what meanes the head is to be clensed with néesing, looke in the first and second Chapters of the paine in the head. Of the excessiue bleeding at the Nose. §. 7. THe excessiue bléeding at the nose hath diuers causes, which were too long to dis∣couer them all at this present time, it only sufficeth vs to shew the inward and outward causes: as concerning the outward causes of bléeding, are blowes, fals, thrusts, sore labour, and the heate of the sunne: all these things do open the veines, and make subtile blood, which is easily mooued to runne out. The causes thereof can easily be perceiued and inquired of the patient. The inward causes be superfluity, sharpnes and heate of the blood, the which is ouer all the whole body, head, liuer, milt, wombe and other places. In like maner also through agues and other great sicknes, through paine of the head, a forci∣ble expulsiue power, and féeblenesse of the retentiue vertue, in full bodies and abounding of blood is the bléeding at the nose requisite, it emptieth the head and other parts. In Phthisi and other sicknesses moe, it is commaunded to prouoke it, whereof shall be more at large spoken in other places. Therfore if there be perceiued an vnburthening through this bléeding at the nose, then it is a good signe of health: like as to the contrary a sudden and excessiue bléeding is very dangerous, and a signe of death. But if this bléeding happen through any bruising of the skin of the braines, then it is very hard, yea in danger neuer to be holpen. And whensoeuer the bléeding is aboue 48. ounces, then it is a bad token, and yet badder if it do surpasse it: if it come then vnto twenty or 24. pound, euery pound reckoned at twelue oun∣ces, then must death follow after it immediatly. In like sort the signes of death are, if the bléeding person be not onely of a bleake colour, but also darke, gréene or leady coloured. An order of diet. THis bléeding at the nose commeth through some causes that require alwayes a good order of life to be obserued. For this purpose is this most common, that those things be alwaies vsed that coole the blood, and make it thicke: if there be any agues with it, then must light things be vsed (which be cooling) as Lettice, Purslain, Endiue, small Endiue, vineger, veriuice. Is then the bléeding strong and vehement? to the end it might once be stayd, vse Beanes, Pease, Lentils, Rie, Colewoorts, Chéese, Beefe, Hares and Harts, also thicke red wine, all hot spices, white wine (if so be that they be not well watred) are to be eschewed. Now we will shew how the blood is to be stanched. For to performe the same, there be sixe kind of meanes: first, by the foresaid cooling things (which be to be eaten) these things following are to be dropt into the nose, and laid thereon: in like maner also vpon the forehead, the iuice of Lettice, of Housléeke, of Nightshade, corne Ro∣ses or Nettles: in like maner the water of water Lillies, of Cichory, of Roses, and Cumin
water: Also the herbe of Poppy, Willow leaues, or their iuice. Item also Horstaile, Shepherds purse, vineger and Camfere, and if it be very great néed, Opium: for these things altogether make thick blood, that it cannot run so hastily out of the veines. It is also good to irrigate his head with cold water, so long continuing vntill his head be so cold, that he get thereby a shiuering and shaking, or trembling. In fine, to kéepe the head cold, & not to stir it much, is very commodious: also wet a cloth or napkin in cold water, in vineger, or in Rose water, wring it not out too hard, and wrap it so about the necke. Item take the whites of twelue egs, powned Allume foure ounces, beate it well together, wet a cloth in it, and wrap it about the neck, about the forehead and temples, afterwards take Hares haire, or the haire of a Roebuck, stop the nostrill full thereof, and that at the first. Also it is commended that both the thombes and their armes be bound hard about the el∣bowes; but let them not be bound too hard, but being sometimes made loose, to bind them a∣gaine. Or make one of these plaisters, take the iuice of Nightshade six ounces, Rose water one ounce and a halfe, Barly meale as much as is néedfull for to make a plaister, lay this vpon the liuer, if the blood run forth of the right nostrill. The second meane to stanch the blood effected with stopping things, as the iuice of Sloes, red Coral, Momy, Aloe, Horstaile, Amber, Bloodstones, Hippocystis, Bolus, flowers of Pomegranats, Lentils, gals, Sumach, Shepherds purse, Medlers, Seruices, Quinces, peares, and other soure peares amongst the compounded things, Trocisces de Carabe, Terra sigillata, which foresaid things all that be of this nature do draw and shut the veines together. For this are also meet these plaisters following, take the iuice of Plantaine and Rose water, of each two ounces, vineger halfe an ounce, and the white of an egge, sealed earth, or in the stéed thereof time as much as is néedfull for to make it méetly thick: lay it vpon the forehead and the temples of the head. Another. Take Dragon blood, parched gum, parched starch roses, the iuice of Sloes, Hippocystis, burnt Iuory, the blossoms of Pomegranats, Bolus, sealed earth, bloodstone, red Coral, and Am∣ber, of each one drag. and a half, Poppy seed, Purslane séed, of each one drag. Opium halfe a drag. powne all that is to be powned thereof, and with the iuice of Plantaine make it to a plaister, and vse it as before. This following is not much vnlike to the former: Take Dragon blood, parched gum, the yel∣low seeds of Roses, the iuice of sloes, Hippocystis, burnt Iuory, blossoms of Pomegranats, Bolus, sealed earth, bloodstone, red Corall, of each one dragme and a halfe, Poppy séeds, Purslane séeds, burnt Harts horne, ashes of gals, Cipers nuts, of each one drag. beate them all small, and mixe them amongst the other with the iuice of Plantaine, afterwards make small cakes of it; when you will now vse it, then beate it to powder and blow it into the nostrils: but you may vse it as a plaister for to lay vpon the forehead and temples of the head. Item take well beaten Momy as much as you please, mixe it with copwebs and the white of an egge, dip cotton or lint in it, and then stop it into the nose. First take Harts bones, burnt I∣uory Dragon blood, Verbascum powned with vineger, temper the foresaid powder amongst it, according to that you will haue of it little or much put it into the nose, all these things stanch blood, tempered together or each alone, or mixe Aloe with the white of an eg, vse it as aforesaid. Item take the whites of foure egs well braied and tempered amongst Aloe one drag. Frankin∣sence one quarter of an ounce, Dragon blood and fine Bolus, of each halfe a drag. vse this, yet putting therein Hares haire made wet. Secondly, take wel brayed whites of egs, and temper Gips or plaister amongst them, so that it waxe a pap, then lay it vpon the forehead, take Hares haire, temper it well with the white of egges, and a little Allume, afterwards mixe it with Rose water, or Rose vineger: take powned Horstaile, temper it with Plantaine water or the iuice of Plantaine. Thirdly, the blood is to be stopt with astringent things, as Dragagant, Gum, Frankinsence, Mil dust, whites of egs, and such like, take Tormentill or Pyrola, one of both, this is to be held in the mouth. These astringent things are not oftentimes vsed alone, but commonly tempered with the aforementioned binding and cooling things. Fourthly, the bléeding is to be inhibited by potentiall cauteries, as Coperas, Orpiment, quicke lime, Sal Armoniack, when the same be powdered and blowne into the nose, for they
make an escarre. But this is to be feared, if so be that the blood be not quenched therewith, that it might afterwards bleed the sorer, therefore it is not without great danger to vse this meane. Fiftly, it wil be staunched with those things which haue a proper and hidden vertue for it, as the iuice of Basil, but especially Asse dung and Hogs dung are said to be good for it (be it of what soeuer cause that the bleeding be prouoked) if the same be but of it self alone held before the nose, and so let smell thereto: and also the same tempered with the iuice of broad Plantaine, and an∣nointed in the nose, or burnt to ashes and blowne therein, or a plaister made thereof and laid on the top of the nose:Termes in . this plaister is also méete against the excessiue termes or flowers of women, put into the necke of the wombe, and also applied to their priuities. This is also very good: Amber, Purslaine, garden Mints, and their iuice with copwebs, thrust vp into the nose. Sixtly, the blood will be stanched if one let it out on the contrary side, the which is effected if one open the Median or liuer veine, as also many learned Phisitions do affirme, that they haue for the bléeding of the nose not approoued any thing more better nor certainer than to open the veine vpon the hand or on the foote, and then to drinke two scruples of Philonium Persicum with Purslaine water: they haue also, as hath bene said, powdered Troc. de Carabe and blowne into the nose. It is also very good to set boxing cups on the shoulders and on the legs, vnderstanding well, that if the blood run out of the right nostril, then set the boxes vnpickt vpon the liuer: if it run out of the left nostril, vpon the Milt in the left side: also the legs, the armes and the breast are to be bounden, to rub the outward members, and also vnder the armpits and other places of the body with burnt nettles for to draw therewith the blood downewards. Besides all these aforesaid, I am to manifest one remedy more that excéedingly stoppeth al∣so bléeding: Take sleckt lime, make a plaister thereof with vineger, lay it ouer the nose, it will stop presently. Others suppose also that this lime is to be blowne into the nostrils, or made vp with the white of an egge, to be so put with a taint into the nose. This also (as some suppose) wil the wooll or flaxe do, that flieth from the herbe Carduius Benedictus, cut small and thrust into the nose. Item it hath bene oftentimes found, that an extreme frighting hath caused blood by and by to stanch and cease for that the blood runneth then towards the hart. In this also hath superstition and vnbeleefe taken place, whensoeuer one holdeth in his hand a dead mans bone, and the mosse that groweth vpon a dead bodies scalp be stopt into ye nose, then is the blood stanched out of hand. In like maner also, albeit that it be somewhat more naturall, if one lay the mosse of the blacke (or sloe) thorne in the shooes and go thereon, it doth stanch blood. Item take broade Plantaine and the iuice of Shepheards purse, of each thrée ounces, prepa∣red Bloodstone, fine Bolus, sealed Earth, Dragon blood, of each one dragme and a half, spread it on a cloth, and lay it on the place of the nose where the bloud cometh, and refresh it oftentimes. Or take beaten Beane meale, temper it with the white of an egge, and vse it as before. It com∣meth also otherwhiles to passe (and is also no wonder) that such superfluous blood of the nose doth bring swouning with it; for the which are sicke persons hands and feete to be rubbed with salt and vineger, to bind fast the armes and legs, and to bind and vnbind them againe, also to vse other outward meanes, which here afterwards in the second part shall be described for the swouning. Item if the blood run out at the right nostrel, set a boxing cup vnpickt vpon the Liuer: and so whensoeuer the swouning is past, the Liuer veine is to be opened, or the Salnatella in the left side, & to smel to cold things, as that which is made of Quince peares, and to vse Lettice, Purslaine, Beanes, and other pottages, vntill that the blood waxeth thicke. For a conclusion, you haue hereafter many remedies in the fifth part for to stanch bloud, which are also good for this purpose. Enfeebled or lost smelling. §. 8. THis is no small disease to man, for if one be borne with it, or haue had it long, he is esteemed by the Grecians incurable, vnles it be through continuance of time and with great trouble: neuerthelesse the auncient and latter Phisitions haue imployed all
diligence to deuise all necessary meanes; and first described thrée seuerall kinds thereof. The first kind, where throughly and wholy the smell is lost. The second is a diminishing of the smell, where a thing is smelt like as it is, yet vnperfectly: and this disease is much more with men then with beasts, for that they be of a moister braine, and all beasts haue their braines much drier, therefore they do also smell sharper and fur∣ther. The third kind is a corrupted smel, where one receiueth the smel otherwise then it is of it self, like as when one adiudgeth stinking things for odoriferous. The cause that the smell is vtterly lost, is when the conduits that go towards the braines be throughly obstructed, that the aire re∣ceiued cannot come to the skin of the braines, which obstruction may happen through some vio∣lent motion or blowes on the head. Also if about the place and instuments of smelling there in∣gender any wart or fleshly excrescence, or any vlceration: or also through any other grosse humors that will settle there, and stop vp the conduits of smelling. Lastly through repletion of the head and of the whole body. The cause of the diminishing of the smelling is as before, but is not so great: it may also be caused by cold or by hot medicines, which be vsed at the nose. The cause of a corrupted smell is a bad moisture, which lieth hidden in the same place, and there maketh stinking vapors: and so may also the canker of the nose be caused and procured. The signes of the obstructions are, that no moisture commeth out of the nose without paine, vnlesse the braines had some impediment: but if any moisture doth appeare without paine, then doth the same moisture obstruct the conduits of smelling. If it procéed of heate and drought, then may you perceiue the heate in the forehead and nose: if of cold, it is also discerned by the same places: or if it be some stinking moisture, then doth all stinke that he smelleth vnto, and all what is neare him, also his breath is vnsauory and stin∣king. Other infirmities or lets are knowne by sight, they may also be discerned by the paine and by the matter. The cure of them all consisteth especially in comforting and cleansing the infirmities of smelling and the braines, whence most commonly all these infirmities do pro∣ceede. It may also be perceiued by the former reasons, that all these obstructions and sorenesses, the diminishing and losse of smelling doth procéed of humors: now to remedy the same, are you to begin the cure by a good diet, wherefore all meates easie of digestion are best, as broths, yolks of egs, Hares braines, which haue a proper and secret vertue for this infirmity, Pullets, yong Pi∣geons, Partridges, Fesants, Veale, Cawdles, and all of them distilled with Sage, Marioram, Rosemary, and Betony: parched hasel nuts are also very good for this purpose: smal white wine shall be his drink, neither may you omit to purge the body: if the sicknesse be caused of cold, then is he to be purged as hath bin said in the second chapter and first §. of the cold paine of the head; but if blood and heate do cause it, then are you to procéed as hath bin shewed in the first chapter and sixt §. Afterwards you are to cleanse the head with néesing in them that haue lost their smelling without any excrescence of flesh or sorenesse of the nose: for which purpose you may looke the se∣cond chapter & second §. also in the sixt §. of this present chapter: but these simples are especially to be vsed for it, to wit, Amber, Rosemary, Cinnamom, Cloues, Lignum Aloes, Nigella, to which he must smell often and long, for they open the obstructions of the head; which is also effected with these dried herbes following; namely, Rue, Germander, field Cipers, Nep, and Marioram: but for to prouoke sternutation or néesing, take Lignum Aloes, pepper, and Stauesacre. Also the vapor of boiling vineger receiued into the nostrils very oftē is of good effect, for because the same hath a biting nature, it doth moue néesing. Also you may seeth one of these things following in wine, and receiue the vapor as is said into the nostrils. Take Calmus, Gentian, Bay leaues, Penniroyal, field mints, Annise and Fennel séeds, parsly, and roots of Smallage: or receiue often in one day the vapor of warme water wherein Melilot or Fumitory be decocted, the water of Asarabacca or of Elder is also good for this vse. Also the séeds of Nigella bounden in a cloth, caried with him and smelt oftentimes vnto it; the same strewed vpon hot coles, and to receiue the fume of it. Item take the powder of Nigella, Ireos, of each 3. quarters of an ounce, Marioram gentle,
Cammomill, Bay leaues, Nep, Stechas, of each halfe a handfull; séeth all in sufficient water vntill about the third part be wasted: mixe the powders amongst it, and draw thereof into the head, it doth clense the head very wel. Also this pouder following may be prepared: Take Nar∣dus seed which hath lyen a day and a night in sharp vineger and is dried againe, one ounce, Be∣uercod and Nutmegs, of each one drag. and a half, red and white Behen, Galingal, white pep∣per, Marioram and Nep, of each a scrup. Costus roots, Sagapenum, the seed of Rue and Basill, of each one ounce; stampe each apart, and bind it being tempered in a péece of Syndall, and smell oftentimes vnto it. This is good against all hinderance of the smelling which commeth through coldnesse, be it with or without obstructions. Pomanders. TAke red Storax, Nutmegs, Cucubes, Cloues, Nardus séed, Lignum Aloes, Indy Spica and Cinamom, of each one drag. Muscus and Amber of each one scruple, Laudanum one ounce, make a Pomander thereof, like as there be many described in the sixt part, and is also taught how the same is to be made. Or vse Cammo∣mil, Melilot, Rue, Marioram, decocted in half wine half water. But if these things will not helpe, then take the iuice of blew Flower deluce, and a little beaten Piretrum, annoint that, or stop it into the nose: do the like with oile of Spike, wherin is tempered a litle Euphorbium and Muscus, for both of them be strong and hot. This following is commended for a worthy receit, whereas the smelling is lost: Take small powned Nardus séed, temper it with oile of Oliues, bend the head backward as much as is pos∣sible, and let thrée or foure drops fall into the nose, but take the mouth full of water, to the end the oile may run the lesfe into the mouth. Item take Nardus séed which hath lyen thrée dayes in vineger, and is dried againe, one quarter of an ounce, stéepe them in thrée ounces of the iuice of Marioram gentle, or at the least in faire water, and vse it as aforesaid thrée or foure times be∣twéene day and night, and so shall you see maruels. Take oile of Tiles, like as shall be described hereafter, halfe an ounce, Muscus two graines, stroke them in the nose being made warme. The gargarismes are also commodious, like as here followeth: Take Radish, Marioram, Calmus, Betony, Penniroyall, of each halfe a M. let them seeth in a pint and a halfe of wine, vntil about the third part be sodden away; put thereto as much hony as you please, Mustard séed, Piretrum, of each one drag. vse it in the morning. The like also gargarized with decocted Rue and Hyssop, also Piretrum, Masticke and Zeduary, or one of these, are to be taken and chewed in the mouth, and to spet out the moisture: likewise is also very good to strew this powder following vpon the head. Take Briony, Lignum Aloes, graines, of each one drag. Marioram gentle, Cloues, of each one quarter of an ounce, Beuercod one scrup. Muscus, Amber, of each one graine and a halfe, pow∣ned apart, and then mixed: of this powder take foure graines, and strew it vpon the head before where the haire beginneth to the crowne of the head. For conclusion: because amongst the foresaid remedies there be some violent, which may prouoke much paine in so precious a member as the nose is; therefore droppe therein when the paine is too great, the oile of Gourds séed, and poure warme water vpon the head, that will asswage the heate and paine: so will also all whatsoeuer cooleth and moisteneth, whether it be vsed inwardly or outwardly, or stopt inwardly into the nose: like as for example, a cloth made wet in Rose water and laid vpon the nose, or Rose water drawne vp into the nose. Oyle of Tiles or Brickes, called Oleum Philosophorum. THis oile is worthy for her vertues sake, that it should be here described: for it is not onely good for the lost smelling, but also for all cold sicknesses, for it is warme and piercing, it consumeth all though moisture of the members, and expelleth all swelling: it is also very good against the falling sicknesse, swimming of the head, the dead palsie, losse of memory, crampe, and paine of the backe, and against all manner of goutes: it is also highly commended in all diseases of the milt, the
bladder, and of the kidneyes, in all vlcers, lepry, scals and fresh wounds. This oile is made as hereafter followeth. Take a very old Tile or Bricke, beate it in péeces as big as Walnuts, make it glowing hot, cast one peece after another in old Sallad oyle, leaue them therein so long, vntill they be well soked through with the oile; afterwards beate them to fine powder, and put them in a glasse helme, the which is cleane ouer well luted, lute also the helme and the recipient, afterward di∣still it in sand or ashes, but first with a mild fire augmenting the same a little; the oile which commeth out of it, preserue it well stopt. The ninth Chapter. Of the Eares. THere be more parts of the face, to wit, the Eares, in truth precious and necessary members, the which nature hath ordained as instruments for receiuers and iudges of the voice and their noise, whereof as well men as beasts haue alwayes twaine, on each side of the head one, that alwayes stand open, because that as well sleeping as waking we haue néed of hearing. They be also outwardly shapen with diuers crooked en∣trances, to the end they may receiue much aire, and noise might retaine and discerne the same the longer: which crooked wayes are also meet for this, that there may not easily fall any thing therein, which otherwise might befall if the entrance were right out, whereto is alwayes the moistnes in the entrance of the eares, which we cal the waxe of the eares, and is as it were birdlime, to the end that the smal flies, fleas, and other such like that would otherwhiles creepe into the eares, might be first stayd therin. It is also very seldome seene that men can stir their eares, the which neuerthelesse is seene in all fourefooted beasts. The eares are also subiect to many kind of diseases, the which are diuided by the learned into three principall kinds. The first is when any one is wholy and throughly bereft of his hearing, the which we call with one word deafnesse. The second is when the hearing is diminished or weakened, like as when one heareth not but when one calleth alowd to him. The third kind is when the hearing only is lost or altered, like as one thinketh that he heareth one pipe, sing, rush or any thing else, the which in truth is not so. But of this and of other moe that concerne the eares, we will write thereof more at large. The causes which may hurt both these, are almost incurable, some be naturall, some also through some outward and inward accidents, to wit, as to come out of too hot or too cold ayre, sudden alteration of cold or heate, from warme water to cold water, or any thing else that might come into the eares, as thrusting, falling, striking, wounds, beasts that may créepe there∣in, vnslackt lime, &c. In like maner also disturbance of the braines, of the head, and of the whole body, rheumes of the head, and chiefly cold, toothach, paine of the sinewes, and of other members which do touch the hearing: or impostumations, swellings, and wormes that do grow in the eares. All these and other moe haue their speciall signes. If the deafnesse or diminishing of the hearing procéed of outward causes, the same may be well demaunded of the patient: Doth it come from the braines? then will also the sight, smelling, and especially the tast be annoyed. If it be caused through hot impostumes, or swelling of the sinewes, then is there intolerable paine, panting, trembling, and some frensie with it, yea hot agues, and lastly death it selfe, if so be that there be not some good aduise taken for it in time. If it be caused through cold humors, there is then impostumation and cold alwayes about the same places. Be winds the causes? then is there alwayes some sissing with it. Impostumations do yéeld matter: wormes may be perceiued by their stirring or rumbling, and if otherwhiles one fall out: what now concerneth the description of their remedies, our beginning shall be first of all of the paine of the eares, and afterwards of all other infirmities of the eares.
Paine of the Eares in generall. §. 1. FIrst it is herein to be noted, that the paine of the eares is not rightly nor proper∣ly spoken; for that which toucheth the outward part of the eare, the same can suf∣fer no great paine: and although the paine were great, yet is there no danger of life with it, for that they be no principall members of the life: neuerthelesse this is wont to be called, the paine in the eares which is within the head, and in the instruments of the hearing, as in the sinewes of the hearing, which are néere vnto the braines, and are knit therewith; of which intolerable paine deadly agues and frensies do procéed. There∣fore we will here expresse sundry remedies for the strengthening and cleansing of the braines, from whence these terrible accidents do come, like as already hath bene done in the description of the head, in the first and second Chapter, and more yet where we haue discoursed of the pose or murre, that for this are especially these following gentle cleansings of the head commaunded to be vsed. Take two ounces of Marioram gentle, white wine one ounce, the séeds of Licebane, Piretrum, of each one scrup. temper it and drop it into the eares: such cleansing of the head is not to be spa∣red, as long as the paine of the eares or head endureth. Or when he perceiueth that it will come againe, it is forthwith to be preuented and cut off: but if the paine get the vpper hand, which is caused through blood, the which the red and swolne face with beating of the braines doth shew; then is the head veine on the same side where the paine is to be opened, that the matter may be drawne downewards. If there run any choler amongst it, then may the same be purged with yellow Mirobalans, sower Dates, sirupe of Roses, Cassia, de Succo Rosarum. After both these remedies following, or one of both are to be vsed outwardly. Take oile of Roses, of Willow leaues, of each a like much, temper a litle vineger amongst it, and drop it lukewarme in the eares. Or take warme womans milke like as it cometh from the breast, and dropt it oftentimes therein. Both of them do slacke the heate, and asswage the paine. For this is also good the braied white of an egge, tempered with a little oile of Violets and some Camfere: others do vse oile of water Lillies alone, or tempered with others. A generall rule of the outward applications into the Eares. FOrasmuch as now it is of much importance, how that is to be vsed which is to be put into the eares, therefore we will (before we run any further) declare this rule following. First there ought nothing to be dropt into the eares before that the body and especially the head be purged: but before we come to this, he may vse the fomentations, bags, vapors, and plaisters that are to be vsed most safely: for this application hath alwayes some more danger in causing some obstruction or stopping. And if so be that with them nothing can be effected, then is the im∣position to be attempted; yet the eares are first of all to be cleansed with clothes: also there is no∣thing to be put therein, which by nature is either too hot or too cold, but al whatsoeuer is middle, meane and lukewarme: also not too much, but from one to foure drops, and to hold the same not aboue thrée houres in the eares; howbeit neuertheles others do suppose this time to be too short, for that the medicine in so short time cannot performe his operation, therefore do they prescribe sixe or eight howers. In the imposition shall the patient lie vpon his whole eare, yet not to drop it in, if so be that it be not first run out: the which through néesing, crying, strong blowing of the nose is done. And this is also to be noted, that there is neuer any repelling medicines therein to be vsed, to the end that the paine be not driuen to the braines. Now for to come to the hot pains of the eares, then take the water of Purslaine, grated Gourds (the iuice prest out) temper them, or vse each alone like as is already taught. Or take the séeds of Gourds, Melons, Pompions and Cucumbers, of each one drag. and a halfe, beate them and seeth them in sixe ounces of vineger vntill that two ounces be consumed; straine them through a cloth, and vse them like as all the other. Take the iuice of Housleeke, oile of Roses, of each halfe an ounce, and temper them: or take
the iuice of Roses, of Housleeke, of each halfe an ounce, oile of Sesamum two drag. temper them togither. Or take the oile of Roses two ounces, sharpe vineger halfe an ounce, let them seeth vn∣til the vineger be sodden away, then temper therin Philonium Romanum one quarter of an ounce, and rub it in and about the eares. Take the iuice of Housléeke, temper it with womans milke and vse it. Also you may take the iuice of Peach leaues, tempered with a little vineger. Item take a small glasse with a narrow neck, put therein the fresh leaues of Violets halfe ful, put more vnto it afterwards twenty Ants egges, and then fill full the glasse with the foresaid Violet leaues, stop it tight: bury it the space of sixtéene dayes in the ground wherein Ants are; afterwards wring them out, and drop thereof into the eare: and if one perceiue thereby no amendment, and that the paine be yet augmented, then are stronger things to be vsed for it as followeth. Take Opium one scrup. oile of Roses one ounce, temper them together, and drop a litle thereof in the eare, it asswageth the paine and procureth sléepe: but do this but seldome, for we haue of∣tentimes warned you from the Opium. The same may you also do with the iuice of Southern∣wood, with the foresaid oile. In like maner also garden Snailes decocted in the oile of Almonds. Eyewaters may also be vsed for this, which are ordained for the hot and sharp paine of the eies, like as here before in the seuenth Chapter, in the fourth and fifth §. is declared, if so be that the paine be intolerable. This plaister following is very highly commended for all paine of the eares: Take dry Vio∣lets and Cammomil, of each one ounce; temper amongst it well decocted and beaten Henbane roots, with Barly meale, of each one ounce and a halfe, the fat of Hens one ounce, oile of Cam∣momill as much as is néedful; let them séeth thicke together, and lay it vpon the eares, and vpon the temples of the head: when it is cold, then lay another vpon it that is warme. It must also not be neglected to rub the patient softly behind his eares with the foresaid oile, being made lukewarme, once or twise a day. But if the occasion of this paine be through cold, then parch first Millet and salt vpon the fire, and lay it warme ouer it in a cloth, and purge the patient, like as hereafter shall be taught of the diminishing of hearing. For to put into the eares, are to be taken these things following which are extant or in readi∣nes, as oile of Baies, oile of Costus, oile of Radish séeds, the iuice of Marioram gentle, the which also is good each apart, or mixed and dropt therein. Also oile of Rue, oile of Spike, of Beuercod, and of Behen: the eares are to be rubbed round about with the salue of Martiaton, and couered with vnwasht sheepes wooll, and to do this twice in 24. houres. Take oile of Roses or of Egs, and the iuice of Sage, of each two ounces, stampe therein one or two Scarabées (which are of the small beasts that fly abroad in the euening with or without hornes) also as many Earthwormes washt in wine, seeth this by a soft fire vntil all the moisture be wasted: afterwards straine it through a cloth, and drop thereof in the eare euery morning and euening lukewarme two or thrée drops. Item temper Beuercod with womans milke, vse it as aforesaid: if this help not so soone, then take Ants, bruse them and temper them with womans milke: the iuice of Radish dropt therein the space of thrée dayes shall also take away the paine. Take the iuice of Pauls betony, of strawberry leaues, of Sage, of Housléeke, of each one ounce, Mastick and Frankinsence of each one drag. and a halfe, temper them together; the decoction of Coleworts two ounces: drop thereof into the eare, should also take away all paines. Of the order of life or diet. VVHereas we haue shewed many causes of the disease in the eares, yet can there no cer∣taine order or rule be yeelded for it. But one must direct him according to the quality or importance of the cause. But generally whereas paine or impostume of the eares be approching, then must one kéepe him alwayes sober in eating and drinking, and to eschew all that which ascendeth to the head, whereof is already sufficiently expressed: also all that maketh wind, as pottages, moist fruite, cheese, smoked and salted flesh, vnleauened bread, and great fishes, small or watered wine is he to drinke, and to eate roast meate: Comin, Annise, Caraway, and Fennell are very requi∣site
for all diseases of the eares which procéed through cold: so also is prepared Coriander after meate. Of the noise and hissing in the eares. §. 2. THis disease hath many causes, as blowes without wounds, ouermuch vomiting, great stirring of the head and the whole body, great cold or heat, wind, moisture of the head, or the impostumation of any other member: but the principallest cause of this sissing is, that the vapor and winds of the braines do fall into the eares; and according to the importance thereof, do forcibly rush like water, which either continueth alwaies without intermission, or at some times also ceaseth. Now pretermitting many subtil differences; this hissing procéedeth most through the feeblenes or imbecility of hea∣ring, by reason it is not throughly cléere and cleane, so that it may be thereby knowne, to wit, that it is lesse perceiued fasting and when one is hungry, than when one hath eaten; for that the ascending vapors of a full stomacke do much take away all such purenesse in hearing. This hissing must be preuented betimes, for that when it endureth continually, it is not to be cured through good gouernement and necessary medicines; then commonly followeth after it a perfect deafnesse: and for this are commonly vsed these following: Pillulae de Hiera, Mastichi∣nae, Cochiae, Sine quibus, de Agarico, and Trocisci de Agarico. These diseases of the head be cleansed with the things which are described in the first §. of the paine of the eares through neesing and otherwise. Certaine auncient Phisitions haue more violently dealt with it, and aduised to temper two graines of Opium in oile and to put it into the eares, but the same is so perilous that some therby haue remained vtterly deafe: but if Opium must needs be vsed, then is this more safe. Take Opium, Beuercod, of each one graine, breake them with one quarter of an ounce of vi∣neger, and drop a drop or twaine into the eares: yet is this following much safer. Take Sallad oile wherein Poppy séed and Mirtle séed are decocted, and vse it as is expressed. But if the sissing come with anguish of the head, and specially through cold causes, féeblenesse of the hearing and windy vapors, whether it be from the stomack, the wombe, or any other parts of the body, then vse for it the iuice of Marioram with womans milke. Vse also which of these oyles you will, as the oile of Radish séed, of Bayes, of Roses (wherein some Beuercod is mixed) of Mustard séeds, Costus, and of Sesamum, and aboue all is the oile of bitter Almonds commended. In like sort these things following which haue the same efficacy are to be vsed, temper Radish water with oile of Bayes, the iuice of great Harts toong with ho∣ny, the iuice of an Onion alone stéept well in Rue water, afterwards take bitter Almonds and the iuice of Rue, of each halfe an ounce, and prepared Euphorbium bruised small and tempered a∣mongst it: but if so be that these foresaid things do not helpe, then it is a token that this sissing of the eares proceedeth of a great moisture which lieth inclosed in the pannicles, which couer the braines. And then must the braines be oftentimes purged with the pils of Hiera cum Agarico, and Pillulae Cochiae and to take them in the euening after meate. Will you then according as it is aduised vse preparatiue potions before? then take Oximel, and Oximell of Squils, hony of Ro∣ses, sirupe of Betony and of Stechas (which you thinke good) each time one ounce and a halfe, or two ounces, tempered with the water of Baulme or such like, continuing this thrée or foure mornings one after another. After the purging take Marioram gentle, Stechas, Sea-mints, Wormewood, Marioram, of each half a M. seeth them, and let the warme vapor go into the eares. Item, take Rosemary, Sage, Betony, Cammomill, Marioram gentle, of each a little sod∣den together, and vsed as aforesaid. Item, for this is also good, the vapor of vinegar wherein Wormwood is decocted: also the iuice of Onions and of Rue decocted in oile, and two or thrée drops put into the eare; boile the Betony alone in wine, and let the vapor go into the eare: the iuice of Marioram put into the eare oftentimes in the day, driueth away all sissing of the eares, which cometh through any wind or cold matter, and hindreth sléepe. We haue before shewed how to mixe Euphorbium in the oile of bitter Almonds, for which one may take the oile of Elderne, of Rue, of Cammomill and Dill, also of Licebane, Peach
kernels, oile of Walnuts, of Bayes, or which you will: or you may vse one of these foresaid which you will alone or with oile of Beuercod, and of Euphorbium, which is not so hot. Item take the gall of an Oxe, or of a Shéepe, the oile of bitter Almonds, of each half an ounce, the iuice of onions or of garlik and hony, of each one quarter of an ounce, temper them and vse them as is aforesaid. Take oile of Spike (at the Apothecaries) and the iuice of Onions, of each a like much, vse it warme as before, it is very forcicble. Item take one dragme and a halfe of Aristologie, temper it together with the iuice of Bayes, and vse it as before. Hissing in the Eares with bad hearing. TAke white Hellebore, Beuercod, of each one dragme, Rue, Saltpeter, long Pepper, of each two scruples, Euphorbium one scruple, the iuice of Radish and Garlicke, the oile of sweet and bitter Almonds, oile of Dill, of Cammomill and Nardus, of each one ounce, let them séeth alone in a pot of water vntil the iuice be consumed: afterwards straine them through a cloth, and drop two or thrée drops in the eare with a chip or slice of Cipers wood, whereon is laid a good deale of the stamped leaues of Maioram. These little Cipers boordes are very highly commended of famous Phisitions, made warme and laid alwaies before meate vpon the disea∣sed eare and temples vntil it be cold, and this continued so long vntill the hissing be gone away: also when one goeth to sléepe he may lie downe vpon his eare, putting alwaies the stampt Mar∣ioram vnto it. And if any body through the great hissing cannot sléepe, then is he to prepare this bagge fol∣lowing, and after that it hath layen certaine howers in lie, to wash and rubbe himselfe there∣with. Take the innermost of the Coloquint, field Cipers, Asarabacca, Centory, of each one handfull, Maioram, field milts, Penniroiall, of each two handfuls, water mints one handful and a halfe, chop it small, and make two bags thereof: lay them in lie and wash your head therewith, after∣wards wring them out wel, and lay them warme vpon the head, or on the hissing eare. It is an approoued remedy. Item in like manner may you take a drie bag for to hold before the eare, to wit, of Betony, Stechas, Marioram gentle, and Cammomil, lay these warme vpon the eare. Take Mastick half an ounce, Piretrum one drag. beate it smal, and temper it with as much hony of Roses that you may forme Trociscos thereof, chew it in the mouth and spet it out againe: they do draw much slime out of the head. Treacle and Mithridate are not only good against this hissing, but also against al the diseases of the eares and hearing: therefore it is commanded in the disease for to take after purging one dragme of fine Treacle with conserue of Buglosse. After meate you shal vse Mermelade or any such like that detaineth the ascending vapors out of the stomacke towards the head: it is also commended not to eate much in the euening, nor to drinke late: but rather to take a spoonfull of Caraway séed (which is stéeped in vineger) and so go to bed, or you may vse also Annise, Fennell, and prepared Coriander. What meates are to be refrained. BEware of all whatsoeuer doth ascend vpwards towards the head, as Garlick, Mustard, Onions, Horseradish, nuts, strong wine, and all that is made of dow and milke; of Cole∣worts, sodden fish, and especially from Eeles and Tenches, also from all broths, but espe∣cially in the euening: also it were not amisse euery fourth day before the supper, or two or thrée houres after, to take these pils following. Take Beuercod fiue graines, pils of Sarcocolla halfe a drag. washed Aloe one quarter of an ounce, make pilles thereof with the iuice of Nep; after this vse the vapor described in this §. where it beginneth: Take Marioram gentle, Stechas, &c. afterwards this bag or cap laid vp∣pon the head, that both the eares euen to the necke be couered therewith: Take Nep, marsh Mint, Penniroyall, Marioram and Rue, all drie, of each one handfull, Mace halfe an ounce, Ameos, Borage séeds, and Caraway, of each halfe a handful, two white Poppie heads, stampe
all these to powder, and make thereof a cap or bag. Another. Take Asarabacca, Nep, Penniroyall, Stechas, of each one handfull and a halfe, Spiknard, Spica Romana, Rosemary flowers, Basill, Lignum Aloes, of each half a drag. Mace half an ounce, powne this together, and make a cap thereof; make it warme betwéene two Cipers boords, and lay it on the head as before. Capitall powders are also commended for this purpose: Take Lignum Aloes, Cucubes and Cloues, powne each apart, and strew this in the haire on the top of the whole head, as is taught before. Will you then haue a mixt or compounded powder? then take one quarter of an ounce of Lignum Aloes, Spica Indica, Cucubes and Cloues, of each one dragme, Sandaraca and Roses, of each two dragmes, Mace thrée dragmes, make thereof a powder; strew this vpon the head two howers after supper, and early in the morning, like as is said. Whereto all such patients are of∣tentimes to smel, is sufficiently alleaged here before in the eight Chapter and eight §. in the di∣minishing or lost smelling. Of the binding or rubbing in the hissing of the Eares. FOr this rushing or hissing of the eares is very good that the shoulders euen vnto the rump; and the knées vnto the feete, be forcibly rubbed and chafed downewards so long vntill they be through red. It is also very commodious to bind them hard & againe quickly to make loose and vndoo them: also to bind hard the brawne beneath the knees, and then afterwards ascending by little & little, euen to the very priuities. In like maner are also good for this, boxing cups without picking, applied from the buttockes vpwards euen to the shoulders. Lastly if there appéere in the face or on the temples any extuberating, then can it not be ill to let two or three ounces of blood out of the Median. To these we wil adde a very old superstition, whereof Plinius hath written 1500. yeares ago, which is, When ones right eare itcheth, then is there somewhere some good thing spoken of him: but if any ones left eare itch, then is there some ill speaking of him: which misbeleefe continueth with many euen to this present day. Impostumes and sores in the Eares. §. 3. IT hapneth very seldom that nature accustometh to purge her superfluous moi∣sture through the impostume of the eares, neuertheles it chanceth in yong new borne children which are full of moisture; this appéereth oftentimes in the first described sissing of the eares, but when this hath ceased and abideth away, yet cometh againe and endureth the space of three dayes; then it is a signe that there is an impostume of the eares at hand, for which maturatiues must serue, and when it is broken vp, mundification. The running & mattering of the eares is moued through three kinds of causes, to wit, of an impostume, or of some vlcers of the eares, or through any de∣fluxion into the eyes that afterwards falleth towards the eares, and there putrifying, is altered into corruption and matter. For all these foresaid, a sober life is fit and requisite, whereby this course of matter may be di∣minished. Also the patient must refraine from all grosse and vaporous meates: moderate exer∣cise is meete and commodious for him: he is alwayes to hold the body loose: if he be hot and full of blood by nature, then is his head veine to be opened, in the hand or in the arme. And if so be this (by reason of occasion) might not be compassed, then are boxing cuppes to be set vpon the shoulders, also to purge with the pils Cochiae, and otherwhiles moue néesing, for that it draweth the matter into the nose, whereby it may be easily purged and drawne, for the gargarismes are also very meete which are prescribed in Paralysi: for this are also outward things to be vsed, wherewith the impostumation may quickly be maturated, the matter euacuated, and the vlcer mundified, the which can be by no surer meanes effected then by this: Take oyle of Sesamum half an ounce, Ducks and Hens grease of each one quarter of an ounce, melt them together, and drop them oftentimes in the eare, or vse Hydromell, which is described in the end of the seuenth Chapter.
Item take salt water wherein fish hath bin sodden, or the pickle of salt Oliues, and vse them as before: the same may you do also with the leaues of Betony sodden in wine, which are very good for all paine of the eares: or take the iuice of Harts toong tempered with hony, afterwards are to be vsed one of these things following. First. This is a commodious plaister for to draw out the matter therewith, take two oun∣ces of Galbanum, Ammoniacum, Turpentine and Waxe, of each half an ounce, Serapine one quar∣ter of an ounce, the iuice of Onions one drag. and a halfe, Myrrhe, Beuercod, of each one drag. dissolue the Gums in a little Wine, and powne all that is to be powned, afterwards mingle them and worke throughly this salue with oyly hands, so that there be made a hard plaister of it. Another. Take one ounce and a halfe of fine wheate floure, the muscilage of Linséed, of Fe∣negreeke séed, Eeles grease (which droppeth off when they are rosted), gold Litharge, Ceruse, and Frankinsence, of each one drag. make a plaister of it, and lay it all ouer the eare, and rub it also in the eare. Item take fresh Hollihocke roots beaten small, two ounces, Linséed and Fene∣gréeke séed both beaten, of each one ounce, Dill séed and Cammomill of each halfe in ounce: let them séeth somwhat together in butter: afterwards make a soft plaister thereof, and lay it vpon the eare as is aforesaid. Another, which is not vnlike vnto this former: Take the muscilage of Hollihocke rootes, of Linséeds and Fenegréek seed, of each three dragmes, Lilly roots sodden and stampt as much as is néedfull for a plaister: temper amongst it one ounce of séeds of Dill, two ounces of Cammomil, butter sixe ounces; if it be too thin, let it séeth til it be thicker, annoint al ouer the eare therewith, and lay it vpon it. But when the paine beginneth to cease, it is then a signe that the impostume is ripe and will break. But for to draw out the matter the better to mundifie and heale, you are then to vse this that hereafter followeth. Take Sarcocolla, Aloe, Dragon blood, Iron drosse, Verdigrease, Myrrhe and Frankinsence, of each half a dragme, temper al together with vineger, dip a taint therein and put it into the eare. The same doth also the wel knowne salue called Apostolorum, whether it be new or old. Iron drosse alone brused small and tempered with vineger vntill that it be as thicke as hony, rub the same in the eare, it drieth much. The like also doth burnt Allume tempered with hony. This ensuing is also maruellous good for all kinds of impostumes of the eares: Take hony fiue drag. vineger half an ounce; let them séeth; put thereto one drag. of Verdigrease brused smal: lay it with wool in the impostumated eare. Item, whether you see the impostume in the eare or not, you are to wash the eare with water wherein Willow leaues and Agrimony are decocted and mixt with Oximell. If there be great paine with it, then looke in the first §. chuse there what you please to asswage the same: but if this matter and impostume be caused of a hot corruption, the which may be knowne by the former signes, then is the head veine to be opened, and let him bléed. Lastly also purge, as is alleaged in the paine of the eares through heate, and drop often∣times new womans milke. For this is also good oile of Roses decocted with vineger vntil al the vineger be consumed. Some do take oile of Roses, of Violets and Vineger, of each halfe an ounce, Henbane séeds halfe a drag. and let them séeth till the vineger be wasted away, then straine it through a cloth: this may be done the first thrée or foure dayes, and then vse this drying and healing salue. Take Iron drosse as much as you please, make it glowing hot, and then slacke it in vineger, and do this so fiue times together; afterwards take thereof one quarter of an ounce beaten small, and bruise it very small vpon a bruising stone; temper amongst it one ounce and a halfe of the oile of Roses, vineger seuen dragmes, waxe as much as is néedful for to make a soft salue; spread thereof vpon the taint, and stoppe it into the eare, or séeth it in vineger and oile. Take shéepes wooll with the fat called Hyssopus humida, temper therewith as much oile of swéete Al∣monds, and vse it in the eare, it is very wholesome: likewise is also Verueine and Nightshade sodden. Item take the leaues of Nightshade, beate them very small, temper some salt amongst them, make a plaister thereof, and lay vpon the eares. Take oile of Roses and clarified Hony, of each a like much, temper it well, and drop it in the eare: this is good for all impostumated and sore eares.
Will not the paine cease, but rather increase? then take Opium one scrup. oile of Violets thrée drag. vse it like as in the paine of the eares is expressed in the first §. Or take two graines of Philonium Romanum, and a little womans milke, drop it in the eare, it asswageth the paine. This is to be laid on the outside, take the muscilage of Linséed and Fene∣greeke séed. Item take Ducks grease, Hens grease, the suet of Foxes, or which you wil, tempered together with oile of Sesamum, it delayeth the paine. If the impostume be very hot, temper Goates suet with hony, this maturateth and asswa∣geth the paine. For this is also méete Butter alone, or else tempered with Calues féete oyle and hony. Item, melt Hony and oyle of Cammomill together, temper some Goose dung amongst it, let it seeth a little, and then wring it through a cloth; this helpeth for the opening of the impo∣stumes. But this ensuing is more better, and more profitable for to maturate and open all im∣postumes. Take Litharge of gold and Ceruse, of each halfe an ounce, white Rosin, Frankinsence and Mildust, of each one ounce and a half, Sallad oile sixe ounces, Fox grease, Goats suet, and hogs grease (altogether fresh) of each one ounce and a halfe, muscilage of Linseed and of Fenegréeke as much as is néedfull, let them séeth vnto a plaister, and lay it ouer the eares vpon the forehead and temples of the head. You must also kéepe a part soft with the water of the greater With∣wind, and when you will occupie it to mollifie it with Hony and moisten Cotton therein, and so vse it in the eare. But if the impostume do come through cold, the which may be perceiued through the small paine, lesse beating, by cold weather, continuance, and such like, then is he to be purged againe with the pils Cochiae. For this is also méet the forementioned suets & greases, tempered with oile of Spike. Item take a good handfull of Millet, parch it in a pan that thereby it may lose the moisture, and may warme the better, put it in a bagge and lay it so warme vpon the eare: this doth also parched Bran mixed with Salt: in like maner also dried Betony laid warme in a bag vpon the eare. Item, hold the eare oftentimes ouer hot water, wherein Mints, Stechas, and Marioram are decocted. Take Rue, onions, both or each apart, vse them as before. This warmeth also the matter, and prepareth it to breake out. The oile of Hemp séeds dropt into the eare, helpeth also to mundifie. The iuice of Onions and Rue, of each a like much méetly salted, doth much dry the running of the eares: likewise also the iuice of Radishes. In like sort are requisite for this these iuices ensuing, to wit, that of Daffodils, of shepheards purse, of Verueine, Knotgrasse, each alone or mixed: the iuice of Betony tempered with oile of Roses, and so vsed is very good for all impostumes and paine of the eares. Item take Beanestraw, seeth it in water and receiue the vapor in the eare, for it is especiall good for all hissing impostumes and paine of the eare which procéed through cold. But if these foresaid things will not help, then take one ounce and a half of Sallad oile, stéepe one quarter of an ounce of Turbith a whole day therein, then let it séeth somewhat, and temper one ounce of the oile of Lillies amongst it, Euphorbium, Beuercod, of each one drag. vse it as the former: this disperseth the matter mightily. In like sort it is oftentimes found, that the water which runneth out of the gréene Ash wood layd on the fire, doth helpe maruellously if one let a drop or twaine thereof fall into the eare. Here before is an oile also described which is made with Béetles, which are called in Latine Scarabaeos, the which in time of need is also to be vsed: these beasts do fly in the euenings alwaies in Sommer. Item take the salue Basilicum, melt it in the oile of Lillies, or the salue Martiaton molten in the oile of Spike, and rub it all ouer about the impostume. Bathing is also very méet with warme herbes wherein Stechas, Cammomill and Bay ber∣ries be decocted: but first to purge with the pils Cochiae, otherwise it is not commodious. And if so be this impostume would fistulate, then temper Oxe gall with as much vrine of a yong boy, and drop it into the eare: or take the oyle of Rue, Hens grease, and Oxe gall, of each halfe an ounce, Swines bread one quarter of an ounce, Comin one drag. both beaten: let these
séeth in two ounces of vineger vntill the vineger be consumed, whereof being strained, you shall twice a day drop into the eare. Item, take wine wherein white Frankinsence is sodden. Another: Take red wine and hony, of each halfe an ounce, white Hellebore one dragme and a halfe, steepe a linnen taint therein, and sticke it in the eare. For this is also good whatsoeuer is described for the fistula of the eye. Outward sores of the Eares. §. 4. ABout the eares do also ingender mo kinds of outward swellings, which are called Parotidae or Gemelli. For that commonly there commeth one vnder each eare, chiefly in the time of the plague, whereof is more at large discoursed in the sixt part. These are somewhat perilous, not onely in the time of plague, but also hurtfull for the braines at other times, for that they be causes not only of fran∣ticknes, but also of death. In like maner also if the matter descendeth towards the throte, it doth sometimes cause a squinancy, whereby the patient cometh otherwhiles in great perill, and might be strangled therewith. These foresaid swellings may procéed from the blood Cholera, Phlegma, and Melancholia: the signes of blood are fulnes and hardnes; if it be wroong with the finger, the place where the finger was sheweth white, and in the twinckling of an eye spreadeth with red: also with heauy breath and ill swallowing. If the griefe do come through Cholera, or of the subtillest blood, then there is a biting paine and great heate, without any impediment either of breathing or swallowing. But if it proceed of Phlegma, then is there a litle paine in the féeling, without heate or great red∣nes. As the other be, the Melancholia giueth great hardnes and little paine, and is leaden co∣loured: these are to be cured as followeth. First, if the patient be of a plethoricke constitution, then the matter of the same is to be auoided & drawne away with Clisters and letting of blood: also to be holpen with setting of cups, especially if there be no headach or Ague at hand, that thereby one do not aggrauate paine with paine: but if there be great paine with it, then vse out∣wardly warming and moistening things, as butter, the yolks of egs, sodden Hollihocke roots, Swines grease, Figs, muscilage of Linséed, of Fenegreeke seed, oile of Oliues, warme water and such like. And if the same swelling incline to maturation, then make a plaister of these things fol∣lowing which are in a readinesse, as Mil dust, Linséed meale, and Fenegréeke meale, or Wheate meale; temper them with water wherein Mallowes, Hollihocke rootes, Figs or Fenegréeke are decocted; these things do mollifie, consume and maturate: when they be ripe they are to be ope∣ned, the matter is to be let out, and the issue so long continued vntill all the vlcer be fresh and well mundified. But if the swelling be caused through cold, then are hotter things to be vsed for to maturate it, as oile of Cammomil, oile of Lillies, and old Swines blood tempered amongst it, or Goates dung, Shéepes dung sodden in wine and a little hony put thereto. This is very for∣cible also, Oxe tallow with hony, oile of Lillies, the iuice of Onions, Linséed oile, Pease meale, and such like tempered together. But if the malady be old, then must strong things be vsed thereunto, as Ireos, Pigeon dung, of the foresaid grease or tallow of old beasts; for how much older the beast is, so much the better is the grease. For this is also good Badgers grease, Beares suet, the marrow of Harts bones: of these fore∣said things may plaisters be made: take which you will: of the gum Ammoniacum, the fatnes of Sheepes wooll, Sal gemme, and such like, are you to mixe amongst it. Of the bleeding at the Eares. §. 5. THis vnaccustomed bléeding of the eares doth come of falling, or of blowes on the head, but seldome of superfluous blood, but often through very subtile blood, the which openeth the veines in and about the eare: if it come in hot Agues, or in great paine of the head, then followeth great ease afterwards: if it be caused of falling or blowes, then is the head veine to be opened on the same side, for that thereby the blood will be drawne downe and hindered that it congeale not in the eare, and so cause an impo∣stume: if there be paine with it, vse oyle of Cammomill, Wormewood, or the iuice of the same
with so much wine wherein hot bread is stéeped, and so laid ouer all the eare. Item séeth gals in vineger and water, and drop therof in the eare. Take a whole Pomegranate, seeth it in vineger, and wring it out well. Also for this is good Hares grease decocted in vineger. But if you be a∣fraid of any gored or congealed blood in the eares, for that vse the iuice of Garlicke tempered with vineger. If there be any heate with it, then take the iuice of Shepheards purse, the iuice of Plantaine, the iuice of Housleeke, which you will, tempered with wine. These are cooling and astringent. Item take both the kidneyes of a Stéere or Oxe, with some of the tallow about it; salt it méet∣ly well, let them rost: of the fat which droppeth off, put a little into the eares. All that is also described in the eighth Chapter and seuenth §. of the bléeding of the nose, that is also very fit for this purpose. Of little wormes that grow in the Eares, and that do creepe into them outwardly, and such like. §. 6. WOrmes do grow as well in the eares as in the intrailes, although that the same be not so common: these do make an itch with great paine. Besides that, it happeneth oftentimes if one do lie vpon the bad eare, that the wormes do créepe or fall out. Against this are you to vse any of these iuices following; of mints, of Peach leaues, Peach kernels, and water wherein Aloes is dissolued, put of each a droppe in the eare; for that they kil al wormes whether it be that they be growne or crept into them, as fleas or earwigs. The same doth also the iuice of Wormewood, of Lupins, of Caper roots, Coriander roots, which haue therein an especiall property; and also the iuice of gréene nut shels: some do de∣coct in wine a little Hellebore, and so drop it therein. But if these maladies may otherwise be cured, then is the vse of these rootes to be omitted. Item take burning nettles, stampe them and straine out the iuice, put it into the eares, and giue him to eate of the root, it will help immediatly. Take Aloe halfe an ounce, Coloquint, Aga∣ricus, of each half a drag. beate them togither, and temper them with hot water, bruse them and vse as aforesaid. Take a slice of well tosted bread, hold it to the eare, then wil the wormes, fleas, earwigs and such like come out: or hold the eare wherein the wormes be, on the vapor of hot new milk, then do the wormes créepe after the vapor of the said milke. Another. Take one quarter of an ounce of Wine, Hony, and oyle of Roses, of each thrée drag. temper them together with the brayed whites of two egs; make cotton moist therein, and stop the eare therewith, lye about an houre on that side, afterwards pluck it suddenly out, then will the worme hang vpon it: the same doth also the wooll steeped in hony. Item set a great boxing cup or glasse on the eare, then will it be drawne out whatsoeuer is within it. Obstruction or stopping of the Eares through inward and outward causes. §. 7. IF the eares be stopt, and thereby the hearing hindered, the same must procéed either through an inward or outward cause. The inward cause may be some tough slime or moisture, wormes growing in them, congealed bloud, matter, impostumations, excrescence of flesh, warts, and such like. Outward causes are if there come any thing into them whereof we will speake seuerally. Do now these obstructions procéed of excrescēces, warts, and such like, which one cannot see nor come at with the hand? then is it taken to be incurable: as contrariwise if it may be seene, it may very well be cured, the which is committed to the Chirurgians, otherwise the oyle of Bay, Oxe gall, Hemp oyle, are very good, each vsed apart. If then the stopping be through slime, matter, or any other vncleannes, mollifie it with oyle of bitter Almonds, or drop hony water warme into it two dayes together, and oftentimes vse the one in stéed of the other: after∣wards take a warme tile, sprinkle it with wine, couer it with a cloth, lay the eare vpon it, to the end that the matter may runne out. For this is also good Goats gall tempered with oyle, or Scorpion oyle: for the stopping with wormes you haue heretofore in the sixth §. the reme∣dies.
If any thing be gotten into the Eares from without. §. 8. THese things are of two sorts, as it also happeneth, that the one child doth put pea∣son, smal stones, or cherrie stones into the eare of another: the other be soft things, as water, Fleas, Earewigs, and such like. If this happen, then is not the same to be slept vpon or delayed, for the things require helpe and aduice with all spéed, for there is great danger imminent, especially if that which is cropen therein be of any bad nature, for of that commeth great paine, and consequently great sicknesse. For this accident, first one of these foresaid Oyles is to be dropped therein, afterwards to bath, and to sit there a good while, moue néesing, and to hold in the breath for to driue out what∣soeuer is in the eares: but if this will not helpe, then is the same to be done with manuall opera∣tion with instruments. But if that which is gotten in be liquid and soft, as water; then vse oile againe, and bend the necke alwaies towards the side of the disease, and exercise your selfe with leaping and iumping: and if so be that it come not out thereby, then indeuor your self againe to néesing. Also you may often cleanse the eare with an eare picker couered with wooll, or with a peece of a spunge, or to tye the pith of Elderne wood at a thrid, and so to thrust it into the eare, or through a little pipe let the moisture be sucked out, the which in like manner may be done with the woormes. One may also hold the eare ouer the vapor of hote wine, wherein Cammo∣mill, Linséede, Annis séedes and such like are decocted. But if fleas or wormes be gotten into them, they do raise great paine through their iumbling, especially the fleas: for the which take a Taint and annoint it with a little cleauing salue made of Turpentine and Rosin, to the end that the fleas being fast thereat, may remaine hanging at it, and so be drawne out. If this cannot be effected, then vse that which is heretofore described in the 6. §. of the wormes in the eare, and wherewith they be to be destroyed. Of the diminishing of hearing. §. 9. THe diminishing of hearing may procéede of many sundrie occasions: the outward causes are these, strong fumes, vnexpected, vehement, and sudden noise, as when the thunder striketh one, oftentimes hath bene seene that some thereby haue lost their hearing, and haue bene starke deafe. In like manner the South wind doth also cause it, by reason that it filleth the braines with moisture, whereby the sense of hearing is inféebled. What now concerneth deafenesse, and the diminishing of the hearing, thereupon do all lear∣ned men first conclude, That if we be borne with it, or that it continue the space of two yeares, that there is no hope at all left for to cure the same: and if the same do procéede of any moisture, water, matter, or other cause, whereby the hearing is weakened, that may be knowne by these meanes ensuing. Take a spunge, make it very drie and warme; bind it in a double linnen cloth, and when you go to bed lay it vnder the eare: if you then in the morning see the cloth spotted, then may you well adiudge, that there is some matter in the eare whereby the hearing is hindered: but if the cloth be cleane and faire, then dependeth it on another cause. If that this disease do then come through heate, yet without any impostumation, the which thereby may easily be discerned: if the patient complaine of no heauinesse, but much rather of lightnesse in the head, the heate perceiued in the féeling may well abide cold things, and hote things very ill: where this is found and perceiued, then to take away the great heate is first to be endeuored, and to drop those things ensuing into it lukewarme. The oile of Roses, oile of Violets, oile of water Lillies, temper them together, or vse each alone. Item, take a Pomegranate, wring out the iuice, put vineger and oile of Roses vnto it, of each a spoonefull, powned Frankinsence one drag. and a halfe, let it séeth a litle, and droppe it therein. Take the water of Lettice, the water of a cut Vine, mixe them together, or vse each alone, the braied whites of egs with womans milk (mingled together or each vsed alone) that giueth suck
to a maiden child, are also very good: the iuice of Housléek alone, or tempered with other things is also good. Take Mallowes, Hollihocke rootes, Lettice, Purslaine, Willow leaues, Nightshade, of each halfe a handfull, let them séeth together, and receiue the vapor. But if this deafnesse, as it chiefly happeneth through cold matter, which cannot be without wind, then is the patients head alwaies heauie, the face puffed vp or swolen, casteth out much moisture through the mouth and nose: For this is the head veine to be opened, certaine potions to be vsed, as Oximel of Squils, or sirupe of Stechas, one ounce and a halfe, in a broth wherein Marioram gentle, Hyssope and Fitches be decocted: and afterwards to purge with the pilles Cochiae euery 14. day once, in the weight of a French crowne. Some do vse the Hieralogodion: two daies after purging he is to gargarise with this decoction following. Take Hyssope, Marioram, field Mints, of each halfe a handfull, Calmus, Mustard séede, of each three drag. stampe and beate it with honie vnto a confection, take thereof one quarter of an ounce, temper it in eight ounces of water, wherein Dane wéede, Fullers grasse, or Licebane is decocted. Also to prouoke néesing is very méete: how that is to be effected, looke in the first Register. In like maner, Masticke doth draw out much slime. Also Ginger and Pieretrum, oile of bitter Almonds alone is to be dropt into the eare, oile of Bay tempered with a little oile of Roses, & some Pepper amongst it, or the iuice of an Onion, of Radish, of Garlicke, of Daffadils (which you wil) as much strong vineger with it, and for euery ounce foure graines of Euphorbium, tem∣pered amongst it: The vapor of water wherein woormwood is decocted, and the warme vapor of Vineger receiued into the eare openeth all obstructions, and consumeth all moistures. Take Hares gall, Foxe fat, molten Pitch, of each a little quantitie, temper them together, it is very good for deafenesse. In like sort Shéepes gall, Sallad oile, the oile of bitter Almonds, and wine decocted together vntill the wine be cleane euaporated. Of this ensuing it is said, that it hath holpen deafenesse, which hath continued thirty years, and they that find it so may iustly say, Probatum est. Fill a hottell with the blossomes of Walnuts, stop it fast with waxe, that it do not putrifie, & that there come no vapor out of it, burie it in horse dung, that it stand couered all about thrée quarters of a yard: let it stand so a whole yeare: when you then open it, then shall you finde therein a kind of oile or moistnesse, that must you straine out and set in the sun certaine daies together, then put a drop thereof into the eare, and you shall quickly find amendement: At the first opening it hath a lothsome stench: therefore must the eares and nostrils be stopped, and to eschew as much as is possible the receiuing of this vapor. But if the infirmitie of the hearing do come out of any vncleanesse, then is the same to be re∣medied with the things described in this Chapter, in the §. 3. of the impostume of the eares, or else if it be néedfull, to vse the manuall operation for it: and if so be that there be no matter ap∣pearing, and that the disease doth bréed through repletion, or of some great former sicknes, then are the eares to be fomented with the water wherein Marioram gentle, Wormwood Stechas, Mints, and Marioram is decocted, for that this vapor doth consume and expell all winds and thicke vapors, which do stop the conduits of the hearing. Also one pound of fresh or new Sal∣lad oyle sodden, and the vapor thereof receiued into the eares is also very conuenient. Trocisces. FVrther you are to prepare these Trocisces: Take Coloquint halfe an ounce, Boras one scrup. Beuer cod, Aristologie, the iuice of Wormwood, of each halfe a dragm. the roote of Costus 1. gra. Euphorbium ten graines, Cowgalles as much as is néedfull for to fashion Trocisces thereof: when you will vse them, then breake it with the oile of bitter Almonds, and drop thereof into the eare. This medicine is very fit for all infirmities or diminishing of the hearing, which procéedeth of wind and flegmaticke humors. Item take Aloe, Coloquint, Euphorbium, of each one scrup temper it all together with Cow∣gall, afterwards diuide it in small péeces and let them drie: when you will vse this, then bruse it on a stone, and mixe it wit the iuice of Radish, and so drop it lukewarme into the eare, and
annoint it also therewith. Item take oile of Bay, and séeth therein a cast skin of a Snake. Take beaten Bay berries halfe an ounce, seeth them in the oile of Lillies; afterwards wring it through a cloth, and vse it as before. Or take Balsam, oile of Iuniper, the oile of bitter Almonds, temper them together, or vse each alone. Item, take the iuice of Sage, as much as you please, temper it with Oxe gall, or Goose grease, or the fat of an Eele. Item take oile of Scorpions, of swéet Almonds, and Wormwood, of each a like quantitie, mixe them together, or vse each alone. The same doth also the hearbe Coriander decocted with Onions and water. Or take Ants egs, powne them, and put thereto a fresh hares Gall, as much honie as both of them, temper them together, and vse them lukewarme. Item take a reasonable big radish, wind it about with wet towe, rost it vnder the ashes, cleanse it, and afterward stampe it, wring out the iuice, then put as much Sallad oile vnto it, and vse it as the other. Take Oxe gall, the iuice of blew flower deluce, oile of bitter Almonds, of each a like quan∣titie; drop it warme into the eare. Take also the iuice of Peach leaues, the iuice of Wormwood, of each a like much: This is very forcible for the impostumation of the eares, and paine of the same. Master Tristrams water described before in the discourse of the face, and 1. §. is very good for this infirmitie of the hearing being dropt into them, and vsed otherwise. But if this disease be caused of too much fasting or too much watching, whereby the face is cleane fallen away, and waxen leane, and the eyes stand déepe in the head, then must one bathe oftentimes, eate well, and drinke more then before, sléepe longer: to powre oftentimes vpon the head warme water and oile, and to keepe it moist. The tenth Chapter. Of the Lips. IN the face is comprehended the mouth that outwardly doth not appeare in sight, but onely the lips, which do hide all that is contained therein, and accordingly are described among the inward members. The vse of the foresaid lippes is diuerse: First and before all they are most néedefull for the spéech, therefore they also by nature are wholy mooueable and light, yea made more swift to mooue then any other muscle of the bodie: so that iustly they may be called neither skin nor flesh onely, but a musklie skin. They do couer (I say) and shut the mouth, to the end there come nothing into it against ones will: also that they might couer the téeth from all cold aire, and whatsoeuer else; they do retaine the spettle, that otherwise would alwaies driuell apparantly out of the mouth. So do they also kéepe in the meate, the which the toung doth thrust amongst the téeth, and might fall out of the mouth. Lastly, both for man and beasts they are behoouefull to draw in the drinke, The learned do ascribe foure kinds of maladies vnto the lips, as chops and clifts, impostu∣mation and quauerings: others do write onely of the chopping and the swelling, as hereafter shall appeare. Of the chops or clifts of the Lips. §. 1. THis is otherwhiles caused through fals, strokes, great heate or cold, whether it be inward or outward, and very often of nipping cold winds: the signes of the out∣ward causes are to be perceiued by the patient. Be they then prouoked through sharpe hote catarres or rheumes, which do fall out of the head? then is there a ma∣nifest heate and drouth in the lips: in like manner also in the forehead and in the
nose: if there be no such, then is it a signe that it doth procéede of vapor. If now these chops pro∣céede of a burnt matter, as salt Phlegma, Cholera, or Melancholia, then are the same to be prepared for expulsion, and to vse three or foure mornings together the sirupe of Fumitorie, of Worme∣wood, or Oxysacchara tempered with Endiue water, or such like; and then to purge with these pils following, which are approued especiall good for all such burning matter: Take the rindes of yellow Mirobalans, Chebuli, Sene, Epithymum, of each two scrup. Mastick halfe a scrup. Aga∣ricus, and Rubarb, of each one scrup. Diagridion two scrup. Fumitorie halfe a drag. make therof pils with the iuice of Fumitorie: one may giue of these pils one drag. vnto one drag. and a half. Afterwards lay a Nut vpon hote coles, vntill the shell be somewhat blackish, then wring the oile out of the kernell, and annoint the clifts therewith. Item take Dragagant or gum of Cherrie trées (which you will) in the mouth, vntill it be∣gin to dissolue, afterwards rub it with the toung vpon the clifts, or dissolue it in Rosewater, and so vse it. Item, take fresh Butter, the muscilage of Fleawort, Calues sewet, Duckes grease, honie, oile of Roses, of each a like much, melt them and temper well amongst them the well braied white of an egge and Pease meale. Item, burne the herbe Ferne to ashes, it healeth maruellous well: or the Waxe, Hennes grease, of each halfe an ounce, Turpentine one ounce, Dragagant halfe a drag. Gals one quar∣ter of an ounce, melt them all together with a little oile, and mixe the rest amongst it. This following also is altogether wholesom: Take the Caule of the Hart or Stag, lay it the space of thrée daies in ley, wash it euery day with fresh water, and renew the ley euery day, let it drie: the third day cut it small, & melt it by the fire: then temper amongst it halfe so much harts sewet, Ceruse bruised small, sixe ounces, Camfire one dragm. or beaten Ginger and Cloues, temper them together: but if so be that the chops do eate in, then leaue out the Ceruse. Pomade. POmade is especiall good and safe. Take the sewet of a Hart, fresh Butter or Barrowes grease, of each thrée ounces, let them melt together on the fire, put thereto foure or fiue small cut apples, also white wine sixe ounces: let all these séethe together, vntill that the apples be soft; then bruise them well together, and put Camfire vnto it, Cinnamome, Cloues, Nutmegs, of each halfe a drag. beaten small together, also Muscus foure graines, Rosewater two ounces; seeth these againe in another pot in boiling water, vntill all the Rosewater be wa∣sted away: afterwards wring it through a cloth, and wash it so long with Rosewater, vntil it be white. This Pomade is also good for all chops of the hands and otherwise. For this is the Poplar ointment also good. Item, take white Waxe, Hens grease, the sewet of a Weather shéepe, the iuice of Rue, of Cammomill, Dragagant, of each a like quantitie, temper them together. Take Gum, fresh oile of Almonds and Hens grease, of each a like much, Waxe as much as is néedfull: these two last are also speciall good for the impostumation of the nipples and wo∣mens brests, although they giue sucke vnto children. The bloud of the lips (do the Phisitions call Haemorrhoidae) it is to be healed like the vlceration and bléeding of the nose, which hath bene shewed in the eight Chapter. The trembling or quiuering of the lips is commonly a messenger of imminent vomiting, the which afterwards ceaseth again: what is to be vsed for this quiuering, looke in the Register. If the lips be hote and swollen: for that do some aduise that the nauell is to be annointed with Sallad oile, the which is easily to be approoued. You haue in many places else what is to be done to all such hote swellings: of the inuersion of the lips, shall be spoken hereafter amongst the diseases of the mouth. The eleuenth Chapter. Of the Beard. THis is the last part of the face which one séeth outwardly, and also a goodly ornament of man; therefore men do desire to haue it grow, and stayed from falling out.
For the growing of the Beard. §. 1. FOr to make the beard grow thicke and spéedily, take Southernwood, Squinanth, of each a handfull, powre oile of Dill vpon it, stop it close, and let it stand a night; then afterwards seeth it in water two or thrée howers space, temper then more amongst it, about halfe an ounce of powned Southernwood: after this straine it through a cloth, and annoint the place therewith, where you desire to haue a beard. Another. TAke oile of Dill two ounces, of Southernwood halfe a handfull, Squils two scrup. wine thrée ounces, let these séeth so long together vntill all the wine be consumed, and then straine it through a cloth and vse it as before. Looke for this also in the third Chapter §. 1. Against the falling out of the Beard. §. 2. TAke as many Bées as you please, kill them and lay them in the sunne or elsewhere, beate them to powder, make with Sallad oile a salue thereof, and annoint therewith the bald place. Take fiue drag. of Waxe, the oile of Palma Christi seedes two drag. and a halfe, li∣quide Styrax and Myrrhe, of each 3. drag. Laudanum one ounce, Euphorbium, wild Rue, Gum, Cantharides, of each thrée drag. powdered Bées or Waspes two ounces, melt all that is to be molten, and temper the powned things amongst it: therewith annoint the place of the beard when you go to bed; but chafed well first: and in the morning wash it off againe; let also the beard be often shauen away. This ensuing is also good for the haire of the head and of the eyebrowes. Take the oile of Behen, séeth Cantharides therein, whereof the head and wings be abated, make it smell well with Muscus and Amber, and vse it as before. Euen as of all outward accidents of the head and the face, mention hath bene made before; so will we now also speake of all inward diseases and members of the same. And first of the Braines. The twelfth Chapter. The Braines, and all that concerneth them. LIke as is alreadie alleaged, the braines are the vppermost and chiefest of all the inward members of mans bodie, a place and abode of the vn∣derstanding, memorie and iudgement, the which are shapen, and by na∣ture fashioned with many kinds of woonderfull, seuerall, and proper shapes, for they be without bloud, without flesh, soft and congealed to∣gether like as a scum, also as marrow, moist, cold, and of themselues in∣sensible; where they neuerthelesse through the sinewes, do impart and send to all other members the sensiblenesse and motion. With this part of the bodie are all beasts indued (which haue much or little bloud) but most of all men aboue all beasts, and the men more than the women: the foresaid braines are also moister in man than in any beast. Hence do also spring all the sinewes, that thence (as is specified) do spread themselues tho∣rough the backe ouer all the whole bodie, strengthening and conioyning it, making it mouea∣ble and sensible. Vnto the braines do also stretch and reach the right beginning of all veines out of the heart, and there do they end: from thence commeth also sléepe, which imparteth rest vnto the whole bodie. It is also the second part (next to the heart) that is formed in the mothers wombe. This precious and tender part is also subiect vnto many accidents, which bring with them very great inconueniences, like as for example, if so be that the brains through fals or strokes be
annoyed or molested; then doth it oftentimes come to passe, yea commonly, that the patient be∣commeth mute and dumb: like as also in the dead palsey the members are altogether nummed or vtterly lamed, and so losse of vnderstanding ensueth. But before that we do come to these in∣firmities, we purpose here to admonish, that before the description of other diseases of the head, those things are not discouered, which might be conuenient for the brains; as Néesing, Treacle, Mithridate, Eyebright wine, conserue of the same, and such like. With these may be also well annexed, all that strengtheneth the braines, dryeth the superflous moisture, taketh away heate, and whatsoeuer might be else. But because our whole booke is full with such like things, there∣fore it is the lesse needfull for to write much thereof. For to drie the braines. FOr to drie and strengthen the braines, you haue amongst other, many and sundrie reme∣dies. When you go to bed, swallow down two or three little péeces of Frankinsence, this strengtheneth and dryeth the braines maruellous much. The smell of Sugar is also very good receiued at the nose. Certaine Aromaticall wines which in the last part are described with their operations, and other moe, as Calmus, compounded waters, Master Tristrams water, are also very good for this vse. And especially this following: Take Ireos thrée ounces, Lauander flowers, Rosemarie flo∣wers and the hearbe, Rose leaues, of each one ounce and a halfe, red Styrax, Benzuin, of each one ounce, Nigella, prepared Coriander, Epithymum, Stechas, of each one dragm. make a powder thereof, furre a cap therewith and weare it on the head. You shall haue also many moe such like whereas we shall discourse of the giddinesse of the head. But if you desire any cooling things for the braines, whereto you haue not onely commodi∣ous things to lay thereon in the first Chapter and second §. but also in other places where we discourse of the Ague and Plague, as much as concerneth their vertues and infections of the braines; we will begin with that costly treasure of memorie. Of the Memorie. §. 1. MEmorie is a retaining of acts either heard or séene: Or memorie is a comprehension of the things ouerpast; the which the mind, as present, doth kéepe and retaine. Item, memorie is a retaining, establishing, and preseruing of matters which haue bene conceiued in the spirit. If so be that this memorie be hurt, then followeth forgetfulnesse of matters which be past and done. And there be two sorts described thereof by the Phisitions: The first they do call the greater Lethargus,Lethargus. the sleeping disease, whereof we will speake apart hereafter. The other is lesse and without Ague, that may in time so take the vpper hand, that not onely the memorie will be enféebled, but also that men lose their vnderstanding, and become childish and foolish. The cause of this is commonly a bad and cold complexion: otherwhiles al∣so adioyned with cold and moisture which ouerruleth the hinder part of the head. If it be cau∣sed onely through cold,Stupor. Cold braine. then it is Stupor, astonishment: These sicke persons do speake neither of things past, nor yet things to come; they care for nothing, they sléepe and wake méetly, they féele no drought of the toung nor yet of the nose. Cold and dry.But if this disease be caused through cold and drith, then can the patient sléepe, thinketh well vpon things which be ouer past, but not of any thing that is present: the mouth and nose are alwaies drie.Cold & moist If it come through moisture and cold, then it is the sleeping disease, which forgetteth all former things wholly and throughly, and all present very quickly: they haue ve∣ry moist braines; so that the moisture runneth out at the nose and mouth. If heate and drith be causes,Mania. then commeth it to Mania, that is, the right madnesse. To the end now, that this precious treasure of memorie may be continued and kept: there∣of you shall haue sufficient instructions which you find of the sléeping sicknesse, astonishment and madnesse: so that we will onely speake here of that kind of forgetfulnesse which is caused of cold and moisture together, and is not an absolute Lethargus: neuerthelesse doth raigne most.
For this is to be applyed for a generall rule to defend the head from al superfluous moysture, how the same is to be effected you haue many and sundrie meanes, especially there whereas it is discoursed of the cold paine of the head, in the first Chapter §. 2. and also hereafter where we shall speake of giddinesse. But to the end we haue an orderly rule for to preuent this forgetfulnesse, therefore we will here prescribe an orderly meanes for an example. If this disease procéede of an ecessiue vncleanesse, surfetting of meate, of drinke, of cold, and such like outward causes, then are they to be shunned, and good gouernment obserued, whereof we will once againe speake more at large. For this, must also strong Clisters be vsed, take Consolida Saracenica, Betonie, S. Iohns woort, both kinds of Sage, both sorts of Centorie, Rosemarie, Stechas, Flouramour. Cammo∣mill, of each half a handfull, Baulme a handfull, Coloquint one drag. and a half: al these things are to be bounden in a cloth and sodden in sufficient water, afterwards wrung, out and to take of this decoction 12. or 16. ounces, wherein shall be tempered Hiera Picra, Benedicta Laxatiua, of each fiue drag. Salt one quarter of an ounce, oyle of Lillies two ounces and a halfe. This Clister (as is expressed) is strong; will you then haue a milder? then vse them that be described for the cold paine of the head: for a preparatiue potion is méete Oxymel Squilliticum, with the decoction of Galingale, or Calmus. Afterwards purge with these pils following, take Pillulae Cochiae one drag. Coloquint, Mastrix, Bdellium, of each halfe a dragm. make pils thereof with the iuice of Baulme, you may giue them all together to a strong man, although they be strong. Hereafter you may vse certaine dayes Treacle, Mithridate, or Aurea Alexandrina one drag. at one time: afterwards purge againe with Hiera Logodion, or Simplici, according to the impor∣tance of the matter. You must annoint the head with Beuercod dissolued in vineger, and oyle of Lillies, or rub the necke with some of these waters of life hereafter described, like as most of all those waters are requisite for this vse which be described in the eight part. For this, is also conuenient, Ginger, Masticke, Pieretrum chewed or bounden in a cloth by reason of his heate, they draw out much moisture. In like manner are things of a good sauour or smell to be holden before the nose, and those that be of hote nature, as Muscus, Ambra, Lignum Aloes, Cloues, Nut∣megs, Indie Spica, Flouramour, and such like sauors: take Frankinsence, Pepper, Cipers rootes, and Myrrhe, of each a like much; make with decocted honie a conserue thereof, giue ther∣of a dragm. at one time. The auncient Phisitions commend much to take euery morning one drag. of Frankinsence, Pepper halfe a scrup. and that with a draught of wine. Order of Diet. FOr forgetfulnesse of cold and moist causes are alwaies warming and drying things to be vsed; the dwelling place must be cleare and cleane, and carnall co∣pulation as much as is possible to be refrained, and that not onely therein, for it is seldome found, that they that be immoderate therein, haue a good memorie or vnderstanding: Mustard, Garlicke, and all things which be of cold nature: in like manner, all excesse of meate and drinke is also very hurtfull: likewise also Mutton, Marrow of Mutton bones, sléepe immediatly after meate, and such like: to the con∣trarie all drie fruites which be parched, as Hasell nuts, and Chestnuts be very good. Also all Fowles are very méete for this, and the braines of the same, whereof we haue made mention in the other description of dyet, where we haue spoken of the memorie, ordinarie going to stoole, and making water, &c. moderate mirth, fresh water wherein Baulme, Fennell, Bay leaues, and such like are decocted. The head may also twice a wéeke be washed with ley wherein Cammomill, Rosemarie, Sage, Baulme, Betonie, or which one will, is stéeped or decocted. Like as for example to be followed, here we describe for these matters.
A good powder. An especiall powder for memorie.TAke thrée ounces of Sene leaues, Seduarie, Cumin, Parsley, and Dill séede, of each one ounce, Ginger halfe an ounce, Cloues, Nutmegs, Calmus, Galingall, Pimperuel rootes, Sage, Rue, Valerian, Annis, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar thrée ounces, powne all small, and temper them together; take thereof in the morning and euening about one drag. at one time: this powder doth not onely strengthen the braines, but also the memorie: it is also good against giddinesse of the head, cleanseth bloud, and is good for the stomacke, strengtheneth the wombe, preserueth the lights from all superfluous humors, withstandeth all diseases of the hart, paine of the liuer, of the milt, of the gall, driueth away the cough, maketh a good color and a cleare face. It is also good to be vsed against all swellings, and against all pestilential aire: hol∣den in the mouth, it taketh away all toothach, stinking breath, and kéepeth men in good health. The water of Carduus Benedictus is said to strengthen the memorie, to take away the paine of the head, to amend the giddinesse, and all other accidents of the head, if so be that one take the water or the decoction of the herbe euery morning two or thrée ounces at one time. Coriander séede and bitter Almonds confected with Sugar, do strengthen also the memorie and the braines. You haue heretofore in the second Chapter and first §. of two ley bags which strengthen me∣morie, and in like manner in the eight Chapter 8. §. of the oile of Bricks which is also requisite for it. Secondly, there be also prepared for this many compounded wines, as the wine of Mar∣ioram gentle, which not onely strengtheneth the memorie, but also causeth it, if it were lost, to returne againe. Another meane for to strengthen the memorie. THere was by our time at Canterburie here in England, a Canon, a Doctor of Diuini∣tie and also in the Law,Iohannes Cole∣tus. named Iohannes Coletus, to whom by that time he was sixtéene yeares old, was an experiment imparted by a Christened Iew, whereby he obtained such a maruellous strong memorie, that he retained and kept all that euer he read in all his life time: the which when he was in his 39. yeare of age, he lying at the point of death, his friends praied him to disclose and reueale this secret remedy and experiment vnto them: where he hath decla∣red that before he had a very grosse and hard vnderstanding; but through the vse of this experi∣ment he afterwards obtained such a sharpe wit and memorie, that he could not only remember and hold in mind that which he read, but also all that he heard and saw: Insomuch that he could recite by hart from word to word the Decreta, Decretals, the orders of all the Emperors lawes, with their expositions, Aristotle and other authors which he had séene and read. Also how many names that were rehearsed before him, he could afterwards without missing one repeate them againe. Therefore may this experiment be reputed of a great value, and as a gift of God, because that thereby men may with so little trouble attaine vnto so great a matter. First, the head is to be cleansed with these things following: Take Pieretrum, Marioram, Galingale, Ginger, Caraway, séed of broad Plantaine, prepared white Mustard séede, of each a like much: this being beaten grosse together, and if this powder wey about two ounces, then séeth it in a quart of water stopt close too, when it hath now sodden well, then put a quart of strong wine vnto it, and an ounce of cleare honie, let it séeth againe vntill about two fingers breadth of the liquor be wasted: herewith are you once euery morning (in the increasing of the moone) to gargarise well and many times, holding it long and warme in the mouth, to the end it may vapor vp into the head. Afterwards make this potion following: Take Ginger, long Pepper, of each one dragme, Galingall one scrup. Cloues, Cubebs, of each one drag. and a halfe; powne them al together to powder, and bind them in a linnen cloth, let them séeth well together in two quarts of Wine stopt fast as aforesaid: afterwards let it stand couered vntil it be cleare, wherof you are to drink euery morning fasting, and at euening going to bed a good draught, and that before you shall haue annointed with the salue which shall hereafter be described. The vertue of this wine is for
to draw a superfluous moisture out of the head. This being done, then place your selfe in Somer time in the Sunne, and in Winter season by the fire, and kembe your haire softly a long time; so that thereby the pores may be opened: afterwards wash your head with the water of Rue, and drink a good draught of wine, and ther∣upon eate a bit or twaine of bread that hath bene stéeped in the wine, then fast so vnto the eue∣ning. Your supper must also be sober, your sléepe quiet and vndisturbed: continue this many daies together, the longer the better. When now the veines be warme with kembing, then annoint the head and the temples with this salue following. Take white Lillies, Colewoort leaues, wild Baulme, of each one drag. powne them together, put them in a pot, powre therein two ounces of Sallad oile, fresh butter as much as all the rest, thrée spoonefuls of the spirit of wine (which hath bene rectified at least foure times) water of Rue, of Sage, of Celendine, of each two spoonefuls, old white wine fiue spoonefuls, temper them well together, set it so sixe or eight houres in a warme place, then straine it through a cloth; afterwards séeth the liquor vntill it be as thicke as honie, (and that by a small mild fire) then set it in the Sunne so long till it be of the colour of Copper: This salue must be alwaies made betimes, and it can continue good the space of two yeares. Also it behoo∣ueth to gather all the hearbes for distillation when the daies be at the longest: and then may also most méetely this salue be prepared. This salue must you (as is rehearsed) vse after that the head is purged, you must annoint well the hinder parts of the head and the temples with it; afterwards couer it with a leatherne cap or hat, so that the head may be warme that the said salue may haue her operation the better in the bloud and braines. In the euening is the head to be washed with good warme wine, and one must kéepe a good diet, and vse meates that be light of digestion, also vse moderate drinking. This order is to be kept at the first by the space of foure daies, and so to continue it the space of a whole yeare, euery eight weekes once two or thrée daies together. The next yeare afterward you may chuse one day vpon which it is good to take Phisick, and then vse this salue euery three moneths once, when the Moone increaseth: The third yeare it is sufficient once in twelue moneths, and afterwards so long as you liue, once in two yeares. Of the giddinesse of the head, and infirmitie of the Braine. §. 2. THis disease is called of the Grecians Scotomia, and of the Latinists Vertigo, which is a giddinesse or swimming of the head, we call it also the swimming of the head, for that it séemeth, that all which one séeth runneth round about: or the sight faileth when he will behold any thing, and he thinketh that he séeth swarming before his eyes many maruels, and things which be of strange colours, yea it of∣ten happeneth, that his eyes be very darke, and must fall to the ground: like as also it somtime happeneth to a sound bodie, if they run too much about: or to such as looke too much downe∣ward from a great height, or vpon a quicke turning thing, or into running waters. This disease do they chiefly get, that are woont to frequent much the Sunne, and their heads haue bene ouerheated: It is also caused of the stomacke, if that it be ouercharged with any su∣perfluitie, whereby the mouth of the stomacke is harmed, and sendeth some bad vapors to∣wards the head, which do cause this swimming or giddinesse. In winter time and when the wind is southerly, then are all people more subiect to this giddinesse, than in drie sommer. Of this giddinesse the Phisitions do make many kindes, like as also it is diuers according to the nature of the humor whereof it is caused: but to speake of the foresaid giddinesse, when any one thinketh that all that he séeth runneth round about, the sight vanisheth as he would fall to the ground, the face and the eyes waxe red, the veines swell, the eares shew themselues great and full of bloud, thereby it may easily be adiudged, that it is caused through superfluous bloud in the head, the which troubleth and molesteth the braines: therefore is this sick person to procure presently afterwards to open the veine behind the eare, and to let out thrée or foure ounces of bloud; for that is a certaine remedie for this disease. And further, for all other spices of this swimming, of whatsoeuer cause that they may procéede: for if so be that this giddinesse do continue long, it is much to be doubted, that the falling sicknes or the dead palsey may come thereby. In like maner are boxing cups vnpickt to be set aboue vpon
the head, in the necke, vpon the shoulders, and on the legs. For this also are certaine lotions of the feete to be vsed, made with herbes which do strengthen the head, whereof before in the first Chapter 3. §. for the heate of the head, and in the second Chapter 12. §. sundry are described. But although these foresayd veines do not appeare and make shew, and neuerthelesse the face were alwayes red, then must the median be opened, boxing cups, as is sayd, to be vsed, to moysten the head with vineger of Roses, and with oyle of Roses, and to eschew all hot meates, much sléepe, long watching, to looke from great height downwards, and such like things: Lintels, milke, kids flesh prepared with veriuice, iuice of Pomegranates or with vineger, rosted peares or apples after supper are very good for him: of herbes, Lettice and Purslaine with vineger may he also eate well: for his drinke he may also temper vineger or the iuice of Pomegranates, Sugar wa∣ter decocted with Fleawoort, or any small thin wines. For purging are meete yellow Mirobalans, especially if the giddinesse be caused of Cholera, the which are thus to be vsed: Take one ounce and a halfe of yellow Mirobalans beaten grosse, séeth them in eight ounces of water at the least, put thereto one ounce of sower Dates, let them séeth togither vnto the halfe; then temper amongst it thrée or foure ounces of sirupe of Violets, or of Roses, and so giue it to the patient in the morning fasting. Take sixe ounces of whay, lay therein to stéepe one dragme and a halfe of Rubarbe a whole night, wring it afterwards out, and giue it to the sicke person cold or lukewarme. Take ten dry Prunes, sower Dates one ounce, seeth them in sixe ounces of water, then take thereof thrée ounces, and mixe amongst them two dragmes and a half of the Electuarie De suc∣co Rosarum, and drinke it warme. Item take sower Dates, Manna, of each one ounce, temper them with thrée or foure ounces of Prune broth. Also these pils following may be vsed: Take Pillula foetidae, de Sarcocolla, of each one scruple, temper them, and make thereof seuen pils. After the purging he is to kéepe him quiet, and to couer the belly with warme clothes. But if to this giddinesse there happeneth no rednesse in the face, nor any ague, it may be concluded therof, that the cause procéedeth of cold, wherof the matter lyeth in the stomack, which there pro∣uoketh the patient to wambling and vomiting, whereto the patient is then to vrge himselfe, thereby to be rid of it; & that through this meanes: Take Radishes, or Horseradish, one ounce, the séede of Orage and of Asarabacca, of each halfe an ounce, seeth all this in twelue ounces of water vnto foure ounces: vnto this strained decoction you are to adde halfe an ounce of Oyle, Saffron one drag. vineger foure ounces, giue therof two spoonefuls in the euening after meate. Preparatiue potions are to be vsed according to ye cause of the disease, for the space of certaine dayes, and then to take these pils following, Aurea or Cochia, the waight of one dragm. Or in the stead of these pils, to vse halfe an ounce of Hiera Picra, and Oxymel Compositum one ounce, with foure ounces of water, wherein Hyssope and Zeduarie is decocted. It chanceth also oftentimes, that at the first this giddinesse doth come with some swarming or fantasies which appeare before the eyes, the which neuerthelesse in truth is nothing so. This the Phisitions do call Scotomiam and Imaginationes, whereof before in the seuenth Chapter and 12, §. is spoken at large. Of the which very many be holpen by these meanes following: Take Eyebright two ounces, Mace halfe an ounce, beate them small; giue thereof after the purging half a drag. or two scruples with wine or flesh broth. What further concerneth this kind of gid∣dinesse, you may discerne hereafter, where we speake of Paralysis, with yt which this swimming doth agree. This patient must refraine from all meates and drinkes which be cold of nature: but Kids, Mutton, Pullets, Partridges, Pheasants, and all other fowles that haue their abode in hilly countries, he may well eate them, yet rather rosted than sodden: in like sort egs and all that is drest with wheate or Rice: small red wine, or rather hony water is to be his ordinarie drinke. But if this will not helpe, and the foresayd giddinesse do still continue, then is this com∣mēded for a principall remedie, to wit, to open the head by actuall or potential Cauteries aboue vpon the seame (which is called Sutura Coronalis) to the end that thereby all bad vapors, which cause these infirmities in the braines might exhalate. Some vse in stead of ye foresaid Cauterie this corrosiue salue following: Take Cantharides (the heads and wings broken off) two ounces, sower dow halfe an ounce, temper them with spirit of wine or vineger, lay them behind in the necke, and behind vpon the brawnes of the legs, in bignesse of half a doller; let them lye so long vntill they raise a blister, that is, about twelue howers or somewhat more. These blisters are
to be holden and kept open, with the laying vpon them of a Colewoort leafe as long as is possi∣ble. But if so be that neither ague, nor vomiting, nor any other impostume do befal with it, and yet neuerthelesse the giddinesse persist and endure, then is the sicke person oftentimes to be pur∣ged with the pils Cochiae, and to withdraw him (as is said) from cold meates, because that the cause of this disease proceedeth of cold. Further, he is to be let smell to a little bag of Annis séedes, and in like sort must he weare a cap with Annis séedes vpon his head, and receiue the vapor of the decoction of Annis séedes into his nose; for that the smell is very requisite, because it drieth and warmeth well. Also the head is to be cleansed, as oftentimes hath bene shewed: but this ensuing is especially good for it: Take the iuice of wild Cucumbers one ounce, honie wa∣ter wherein Marioram is decocted, two ounces; temper and draw them into the nose: but take before, thy mouth full of cleare water, so that it may come the lesse into the mouth. Gargarismes. GArgarismes are also to be vsed for this purpose, thereby to expell all flegmaticke humors which cause this maladie: Take Betonie, Hyssope, of each one handfull, Licorice, Rue, and Raisons (the stones being taken out) of each one ounce, Pieretrum, Ireos, of each half an ounce, Mustard séede, Licebane, Ginger and Masticke, of each one quarter of an ounce, cla∣rified honie thrée ounces, séethe them in sufficient store of water, and scum them well, take thereof before and after meate, at each time two spoonefuls in the mouth, holding it long there∣in, and hauing gargarized, spet it out againe. With this may you also vse chewed Mastick, Picretrum decocted in wine or water, or stéeped. But alwaies (as is admonished before) the rootes knit in a cloth: for it is otherwise too strong. Item, take Mustard séede, Marioram, Pieretrum, long Pepper and Sage, of each one quarter of an ounce, seethe it to the halfe, being strained, vse it as before. The Pieretrum hath an especiall operation against the giddinesse, therefore it is also to be de∣cocted and beaten to pap with the whites of egges, and so laid vpon the head. A powder for meate. TAke Nutmegs, prepared Coriander, of each halfe an ounce, Misselden of the Oke, Piony séede peeled, and Galingale, of each one drag. Calmus, Betonie, Cubebs, and Cumin, of each halfe a drag. Sugar, as much as you please. You haue heretofore in the first §. a good powder for the memorie, which is also méet for this purpose: and this following is very necessarie for it. Take the iuice of Fennell one ounce, Sugar two ounces, séeth it together like to Manus Christi. An Electuarie. TAke a pound of Currans (well cleansed) Licorice cut small, Buglosse water and Endiue water, of each sixe ounces, set them seeth together, and afterwards wring it out hard: in this decoction are you to put of preserued Mirobalans, Chebuli and Emblici, of each sixe ounces, honie of Roses and Sugar, fiue ounces; let it séeth vntill it be somewhat thicker than honie: afterwards clarifie it with the whites of egs: when it is now cold, then temper amongst it one drag. and a halfe of Cinnamom powder, preserued Nutmegs one ounce, Lignum Aloes, Cloues, of each one drag. Fennell and Annis séedes, of each halfe a drag. conserue of Roses two ounces and a halfe. Of this confection you are to vse euery wéeke the quantitie of a Walnut. Item take Cinnamom, Cloues, Fennell, Galingall, chew them long in the mouth, and after∣wards spet it out againe. The confected Calmus is also much commended for this giddinesse, and in like manner confected Coriander, as is more said in other places, where we haue intrea∣ted of the memorie. Preserued Mirobalans are also especiall good after meate, also being drie to chew them in the mouth; for that they do hinder the vapors ascending vp to the head, and consume all watery moisture: also how good Carduus Benedictus water is for this vse, look in the place where we haue spoken of the memorie: the Treacle and Mithridate are also much commended for this purpose.
The order of diet. THey that be troubled with this giddinesse ought to liue very soberly and moderately, to leaue wine, or to water it well: if the disease come through heate, then is heate to be es∣chued; if through cold, then is cold to be shunned: after meales take a peece of tosted bread and eate it. His meates must be light of digestion, and vse little: like as is sufficiently shewed in the hot headache. Of franticknesse, madnesse, or doting, and such like infirmities. §. 3. THe diseases of the braines are diuided into thrée kindes, to wit, first if their ac∣customed operation be hindered. Secondly, if they be perished and enféebled. Thirdly, if they be altered from their good disposition and nature into another: like as when a man falleth into foolishnesse and forgetfulnesse, that he forget∣teth his writing, reading, and his nearest kindred, yea his owne name: the which in truth, procéedeth out of a coldnesse of the braine, like to the palsey, and falling sicknesse, and such like accidents which sodainly assault men. But if this foresayd dis∣ease (whether it happen in the vnderstanding or in the memorie) be small, then it is a signe that the coldnesse is not great,Delirium. for these diseases haue also their greatnesse and smalnesse. Delirium, doting childishnesse, be it howsoeuer it will, it commeth of some bad humor and distemperance of the brains, and is an erring, troubled & spoyled motion of the principall vertues of the mind; and if so be that an Ague befall with it,Phrenitis. then it is a right Phrenitis, that is Frensie; which is not onely caused through hot humours, but is also admixed with some Phlegma in the braines: but in case there be no ague with it,Mania. then is this maladie called Mania, madnesse; and springeth out of hot humours, and chiefly of Cholera, which inflameth the braine too much; Melancholia, of which issue onely despaire,Dementia. sorrow and feare, and that which is called in Latin, Dementia, (to wit, when a man is wholly out of his right minde) procéedeth onely of cold humours, like as hereafter againe shall be more at large declared. Of dotage and childishnesse, called in Latin Delirium. §. 4. THis disease is for the most part in all sicknesses or infirmities of the braines, for that in case the same be distempered, (be it by whatsoeuer manner that may be) then will the vnderstanding be thereby wholly or in part enféebled, according to the greatnesse or smalnesse of the humour whence this disease is caused. When now these doting conceits and strange thoughts do come without cry∣ing,Melancholia. calling, or noise, as if he were possessed, then it is the very true Melancholia. But if the madnesse do come with chiding, scolding, leaping, cursing, and such like misdemea∣nours, then it is the right Mania, or madnesse, with all her syptomes, which do assaile him no otherwise then as if he were possessed. If there be with this madnesse laughing, merriment, friendly semblance, then is the same al∣wayes better then any of the rest: but if this come through burnt melancholicke humours, then it is the worst, and the behauiour none otherwise then as if he were possessed. Others make of these Delirium or Desipientia, 12. kindes, whereof the most part are here described. And to the end we might first of all haue an example how that these kindes of sicknesses are best to be holpen; therefore we will set before vs a youth that hath lost his vnderstanding, and is become distraught. At the first is very méete for it a very good gouernment or order of diet, and to vse all things which be warme and moyst, to eate good raysed bread, which is aboue three dayes old, other∣wise he is to eschue all things that are made of dow: yong Veale, Mutton, Lambe, Pullets, Ca∣pons, yong wild swine; in fine, he is to eate all that is yong whether it be wild or tame, and to refraine all that is old. Of herbes are méete for him Endiue, Spinage, Purcelane. As concerning fruit, fresh Al∣monds,
Hasell nuts, swéete Cherries, Melons, Gourds, Pompions, fresh Figs, Grapes, swéete Peares, Apples, oyle of sweete Almonds, or fresh Butter. He must refraine from Vineger; or if he will vse it, he must delay it with Sugar or water: yet is he rather to vse the iuice of Limons or Veriuice, but seldome, and that made swéete with Sugar. For his drinke he is to take sweete wine, and cleare wine well watered, for that he will be very soone drunken, which is hurtfull for him. In this countrey in steade of the foresayd wine, small béere is commonly to be vsed: he is to forbeare all old and salt flesh. But if so be he cannot forbeare wine, and were yet notwithstanding inclined to drink much, then are you to stéepe therein prepared Coriander séede, Sorrell séede, Purcelane séede, with the flowers of water Lillies, this will resist and withstand all drunkennesse. Can he be satisfied with drinking of water? then let him drinke none other then barly water or sugred water. Buglosse leaues or the rootes of the same are alwayes good, whether they be vsed in meates or drinkes, and all that may be made with Buglosse.Buglosse good for Melancholie. He must also moderately moue and stirre in going and standing. Copulation must he vtter∣ly eschue, bicause that thereby the best bloud of a man is wasted, and worne away and the na∣turall forces inféebled. He must kembe the head oftentimes, sing much, vse musicke which is very commodious for all melancholicke persons, his sleepe must be somewhat longer then it was wont to be when he was in health. Because that this matter is very hard to be purged, and yet neuerthelesse it must be done for the most part, then is alwayes the aduise of a learned Phisition to be followed, the opening of the Piles or Hemorrhoides is especially commended for this disease. One may also drinke many daies togither, thrée ounces of the iuice of Buglosse, for it is maruellous good for all kinds of melancholy. Also is very good two ounces of the iuice of Hops (being wrong out) if it be pre∣sently taken without setling, preserued Citron pils one spoonfull taken in the morning early, and in the euening two houres before meate are very meete, or two ounces of the sirupe of Ci∣tron pils, with three ounces of Lettice water vsed before purging, Comfortable Electuaries. TAke the flesh of a rosted Partridges brest twelues ounces, the rootes of white Behen the flowers of Borage, Buglosse, Seduary, of each one dragme, Saffron one scruple, Mace, Saxifrage, of each one scruple, Iacint, Smaragd, Saphires, and Harts bones, of each halfe a scruple, three leaues of beaten gold, fired gold halfe a dragme, prepared pearles one dragme, three ounces of fresh Pine apple kernels: let this steepe 24. houres with the flesh in foures ounces of white wine, and two ounces of the iuice of Quinces, powne them all small, and seeth 12. ounces of white Sugar with the foresayd liquor, temper it all togither: giue ther∣of euery morning halfe an ounce, and drinke thereupon two ounces of Buglosse water: after∣wards take before dinner and supper one quarter of an ounce of it: for besides that it is good for the giddinesse, it doth also strengthen all the members of the body. In like manner marke, that all which strengtheneth the heart, whether it be hot or cold, the same also strengtheneth the braine. Of Phrenitis, or franticknesse with an Ague. §. 5. WE will now discourse of that kind of franticknesse, which the learned call Phreni∣tis, which we define thus: Phrenitis is a frensie or bereauing of the wits with an hot Ague, or Phrenitis is a doting and distraction or spoyle of the vnderstanding, which endureth not alwayes, and that assaileth one with quiuering, small voyce, and with an ague, which doth also most procéed of some inflammation or swelling in the braines. And although there be many kinds of franticknesse, yet may they be deuided in∣to two principall sorts; the one which is caused of bloud, the other of Cholera: out of both which, the third kind which is Melancholia, as a mixture doth sprout and spring. They that be burdened with the first kind, they may adiudge all things like as they be, know
what it is; but how to thinke of it and vse it do they know nothing at all. They that haue the second kind of franticknesse, they do know in their thoughts or forecast nothing at all: but ad∣iudge much otherwise of all that euer they sée then it is. For both these sorts haue you a nota∣ble historie recited of Galen. They which be charged with the third sort, they be so distraught of their wits, that they can neither discerne right, nor adiudge right. And now for to come to the right signes of the foresaid diseases, we will rehearse these following. The signes of .First inward Agues, heauinesse of the head, drought, rednesse of the eyes and face, paine of the head, shunning of light, and strong motion of the pulse. Item, vnquietnesse, much and filthy talke, drith and blacknesse of the toung, tumbling vp and off from the bed: their vrine white, quicke and strong breathing, crying out in the sléepe, feare, impudencie, do not couer their pri∣uities being vncouered, forgetfulnesse of all that is passed, terrible dreames, &c. And if, besides the foresaid signes, the tongue be red and yellow, and the vnderstanding en∣féebled with much watching: then it is a perfect Phrenitis, that is, franticknes, with a strong A∣gue. For this the remedie is not to be delayed, but before they (which do procéede of bloud) do take roote, he is strongly to be let bloud in the head veine, euen till he swoune, if nature may abide and suffer it. But if so be that the sicknesse haue indured alreadie past the fourth day, and setled it self, then is the veine of the forehead also to be opened on the top of the nose, and to be diligent for to o∣pen the Hemorrhoides, the which is very requisite and sure. And if so be that for some causes the opening of a veine be hindered, then is bloud to be forced out of the nose, or at the least to set boxing cups on the shoulders. But if the cause be of Cholera, then is the bodie to be purged through Clisters, as hereafter followeth. Take two handfuls of Lettice, Barley halfe a M. Mallowes, Mercurie, Violet leaues, of each halfe a handfull, the flowers of water Lillies one ounce, and a little bran: séeth these toge∣ther in a sufficient quantitie of water: then take of this decoction twelue or sixtéene ounces, put thereto Sallad oyle, and prepared Cassia, of each one ounce, extracted Prunes fiue dragm. set this Clister fasting. Another: Take Mallowes, Blites, Mercurie, Violet leaues, and water Lillies, of each one M. let them séeth together in sufficient water: afterwards take twelue ounces therof and tem∣per amongst it Triphera Sarrecenica one ounce, strained Prunes an ounce and a halfe, oyle of Violets, two ounces, Salt halfe a drag. Further to purge withall, sowre Dates are especially fit: for they do not onely expell the bad humors, but also alter them. These are thus to be pre∣pared. Take twelue ounces of sowre Dates, séeth them in 24. ounces of water vntill the fourth part be consumed: this decoction is to be strained through a cloth, and to giue him fiue ounces thereof at once. Item, take thrée ounces of Manna, temper it in the decoction of Prunes, and giue it him in the morning. But if so be that the humors be burnt, then séeth with the Prunes a few Sene leaues, a lit∣tle Fumitorie, and Epythimum, of each one quarter of an ounce, the roots of Polypodium one ounce, and in foure ounces of this decoction, temper the Manna and sowre Dates. Another. Take yellow Mirobalans one ounce and a half, stampt Prunes two ounces: séeth them together in ten ounces of water vnto the halfe, or till that there remaine foure ounces ouer: then giue it so. Or take one quarter of an ounce of Rubarbe, decoction of Prunes foure ounces, beate the Rubarbe and so temper it amongst the decoction; adde vnto it two ounces of sirupe of Violets: let this stand together the space of twelue houres, and giue it him early in the morning. But if so be that the humor be burnt, then put some Sene leaues vnto it, Epithymum, and the rootes of Polipodie, of each one quarter of an ounce. After the foresaid purging, may the head veine vpon the hand or in the elbow, be safely ope∣ned, and boxing cups fixed vpon the shoulders. Also to open the Saphea, and to moue the He∣morrhoides, if so it séeme requisite.
If this sicknesse be caused of bloud. TAke twelue ounce of the iuices of Plantaine, iuice of Shepheards purse and Rosewater, of each foure ounces, Vineger two ounces; make clothes or two wet therein, and then lay them on the forehead, and so ouer halfe the head. Item, take Violet leaues, Lettice, and powned Barley, of each 1. M. Poppie heads, rootes of Southernwood, and water Lillies, of each halfe a handfull, Henbane, Poppie séeds, and Lettice seede, of each halfe an ounce, Cammomill, Melilot and Mallowes, of each halfe an M. Séeth them all together in a sufficient quantitie of the water of Sage: afterwards take a Spunge and therewith moisten from the forehead, or from thence where the haire beginneth, vnto the necke behind as often as you please. Item, take the iuice of Housléeke, of Lettice, of Purslaine, and of Nightshade, of each thrée ounces, Rosewater two ounces, Vineger one ounce, temper and vse them as before: this bringeth also sléepe with it, and especially if one temper therewith two ounces of the iuice of Poppie heads: cannot you get the iuice? then take the distilled water it selfe, if you will haue a plaister of it, temper Barley meale amongst it. Note also that these cooling things are to be vsed onely in the beginning of the frenzie: for that if it be séene that the matter beginneth to yéeld, there are other things to be adhibited; as when it beg inneth to depart, then take a sucking whelpe and take out the bowels, and so lay it warme vpon the patients forehead, or rather on the top of the forehead when the haire is shorn off. Item, take another whelpe (the intrailes being taken out as is sayd) bestrew it inwardly with Henbane séede, and lay it warme vpon the head, this maketh the franticke to sléepe: the same do also yong Doues and Cocks opened in the backe, and laid vpon the head: or take the warme lights of a Weather, hold it vpon the forehead, when it is waxen cold make it warme againe in warme water, but wring it well out, and lay it againe vpon the forehead, and reite∣rate the same oftentimes. Of the dwelling of a franticke man, and other remedies concerning this disease. THe dwelling of any franticke persons must be temperate, more cold then warme: Be∣strew his Chamber and bed with cold hearbes, as Lettice, Purslaine, Housléeke, smal and great Willow leaues, water Lillies, and Nightshade: haue also clothes made wet in common water, round about him plucke away all pictures out of his eyes, for that they bring fantasies and troubles vnto him, let honest people come amongst them, to the end he may be a∣shamed; let him smell to Roses, Violets, water Lillies, flowers, and Camfere, whereof may also bags be made, this is prescribed for an example, how all manner of franticke men are to be gouerned, now will we procéede forward. But if it be feared, that a man would become franticke, then take quicke Brimstone, and Ma∣sticke of each one drag. and a halfe, temper them wel beaten with half an ounce of good Treacle, and giue a youth thereof halfe a drag. at once mixed with Cicorie water, an old body one drag. with old wine. He is to sweate thereupon as long as he is able to indure it: doth it not helpe at one time? then do it mo times, but the patient is to beware of cold and wind. Take Cammomill, the herbe Dill, Roses, Marioram gentle, of each one M. séeth them and make clothes wet with it, and lay them warme oftentimes vpon the patients forehead. Take Violet leaues, Melilot, Mallowes, Rosemarie, Bay leaues, and Poppie heads, of each two handfuls, let them séeth together and vse it as before: the conserue of Betonie, of Gillo∣flowers, and especially of Pyonie flowers, is very conuenient for this aboue all other, and not onely for this disease, but also against all strange fantasies, frightings and feare, the which peo∣ple haue a nights and without any cause. A precious water. THis is much commended aboue all things for to kéepe men in their good vnderstanding, and to restore the same if it were lost: take May Lillies stript off from their stalkes, powre
Muscadell, Malmsey, or any other old wine vpon them, put this in a glasse and stop it fast, and let it so stād certaine dayes: afterwards distill it through soft séething in a kettle of water. This is not onely good against the frensie, but also in the dead palsey, where the spéech is lost, against all faintnes, against all consumption: it repugneth also all venime, and strengtheneth the heart; a spoonefull taken thereof at once. These franticke persons are to be alwayes kept sober in eating and drinking, as is expres∣sed, and to vse cooling things, for necessitie requireth the same: They must eschew wine, and be content with small beere and Barley water, wherein the sirupe of Violets, of Roses, or of water Lillies be mixed. He is to eate Orgemond or Ptisane (called Ptisana) or any other water paps. Also all other cold herbes stewed, as Lettice, Spinage, and Sorrell, yea some require this order to be kept so directly, that they will not allow any other thing in the world. But regard is al∣way to be had to the abilitie of the patient: and héede must also aboue all things be taken, that this patient be not made angrie, nor feared, and not frighted; but as much as is possible to be kept with mirth. For to bring the sicke to sleepe and rest. §. 6. FOr that this maladie doth bring with it much vnnaturall watching, therefore it is néedefull to write somewhat thereof, for that is very hurtfull in the disease, because it doth dry the whole body, taketh away ye appetite, troubleth the mind, contracteth the sinewes, weakeneth the wits: also causeth some Ague, and brin∣geth with it other inconueniences moe; as also the losse of sléepe, which is a ve∣ry bad signe in all hot diseases. The causes why one cannot sléepe are many, as anger, sorrow, paine, heauie thoughts, a full and crude stomacke, hard meates; as Toad estoooles, Beanes, Oinions, and Mustard séede, the which do all bring terrible dreames: Also when there is an impostume in the braines, great dis∣quiet, barking dogs, and such like moe which may hinder the sléepe: these are the common cau∣ses which do kéepe one awake. But how the same is to be redressed, and how that the reuiuing sléepe is to be restored, shall be shewed hereafter. But now to prosecute our method, there be in the frensie (called Phrenitis) which is with strong Agues, these things following prescribed. If it happen that this patient can attaine to no sléepe, like as it commonly chanceth in such diseases, whereby the sicknesse is aggrauated; then may the sléepe be prouoked wel with inward and outward things: whereto these safe remedies are very méete. Take womans milke, of one that giueth sucke to a daughter, foure ounces and a halfe, the brayed whites of foure egges, and white powned Poppy séede as much as is néedfull to make them to a salue; spread thereof vpon the forehead and the temples. Take the sirupe of Poppy heads, the water of white water Lillies, and oyle of Violets, each alone or mixed togither, and vse them (as hath béen sayd.) Take Henbane seedes, and séeth them so long in wine vntill it be thickish, annoint the temples of the head, the nose, and eares therewith: this is very strong, but vse it not but onely in great need. Item, take Poppy séede, & Henbane séede, of each a like much, beate them small, and temper them with the white of an eg, womans milke, and with a little Vineger; vse them as before. When one is come out of his naturall sléepe, or enféebled in his wits, then make a spunge wet in this water following, and lay it warme on his forehead and on the temples of his head: being waxen cold it is to be renewed. Take Lettice, Violet leaues, pilled Barley, Poppy heads, the rootes of Mandragora, the white water Lillies of each a handfull, Henbane séede, Poppy seede, Lettice séede, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cammomill, Melilot, and Mallowes, of each halfe a handfull: let this séeth togither in water. Take Cassia wood one dragme, Opium two dragmes, and Saffron one dragme, make a pow∣der thereof, and at the most take one scrupe thereof, let it stéepe in Vineger and Rose water; annoint the temples with it, it is very strong and safe. In like manner wil be for this (amongst the common things) Oxyrrhodinum vsed: whereof some stand described in the first Chapter and second §.
A Salue. TAke one ounce of Poplar salue, oile of Violets halfe an ounce, Henbane séedes, the rootes of Mandragora, of each halfe a drag. Saffron, Cassia wood, of each one scrup. temper this together: the sléepe was woont also to be procured with this following, binding it about the necke, and to lay it vpon mens priuities, and womens breasts. Take cold water and Rosewater, of each fiue ounces, vineger one ounce and a halfe, wet a double linnen cloth therein, and lay it ouer it. Item, take herbes of cold natures, as Willow leaues, water Lillies, Vine leaues, and Let∣tice, séethe them in water, and wash the foresaid place, also the hands and féete therwith. This doth also, to set the hands and feete in cold water. A potion and such like to procure sleepe. TAke white Poppie séedes halfe an ounce, rootes of Mandragora, Henbane séede, of each halfe a dragme, vnbeaten Saffron foure graines, stampe them all together, and bind them in a cloth, and then lay them in stéepe in fiue ounces of the water of water Lillies the space of sixe howers, afterwards wring it out, and giue it to the sicke person two howers before sup∣per or dinner, from one ounce vnto thrée ounces, according to the importance of the sicknesse and abilitie of the patient. Item, take water Lillies twelue ounces, Opium one drag. stéepe them together in thrée pints of Malmsey the space of 24. howers, then cast therein one quarter of an ounce of Salt, white beaten Poppie séedes halfe an ounce, Henbane séedes one quarter of an ounce, Lettice seede thrée drag. distill the same in séething water, whereof you are to giue going to bed, from halfe a drag. vnto a drag. This is strong inough for to cause the patient to sleepe sixe howers: wine doth also prouoke sleepe if one drinke somewhat excessiuely; in like sort also wine of Wormwood, yet that driueth away heauie dreames. A confection and what else may be taken. TAke conserue of Violets and water Lillies, of each one ounce, white Poppie séedes, white Henbane séedes, of each halfe an ounce, Ginger thrée dragmes: temper this together, and when you go to bed, then take the bignesse of a Hasell nut rather more than lesse: the Ginger is put thereto, to the end that his power might penetrate. Another. Take white Poppie séedes, Endiue séedes, Lettice séedes, and Purslaine séedes, of each two ounces, Melon séede pilled, Pompion seede, Gourd séedes, and Cucumber seedes, of each a drag. and a halfe, Mandragora apples one ounce and one quarter, Saffron, Cammomill, Dill seede, of each one drag. and a halfe, Lignum Aloes, one drag. Sugar twelue ounces, honie of Violets sixe ounces: the Sugar and honie you are to séeth in the water of water Lillies vntill it be thicke; when it is almost cold, temper the other beaten small amongst it, and vse it as be∣fore from one quarter of an ounce vnto halfe an ounce. It is good for franticke persons to an∣noint the forehead, the temples, the nose and the pulse veines therewith, or to take it with the water of Lettice one hower after meate. Another not so strong. TAke white Poppie séede thrée quarters of an ounce, the séedes of Violets, of Lettice, of En∣diue, of each one quarter of an ounce, pilled Melon séede, Pompion séedes, Gourd séedes, Cucumber séede, of each halfe a drag. Sugar one quarter of an ounce, temper this as thicke as you will haue it, with the sirupe of Poppie séedes. Here may you sée that Poppie séedes are vsed almost in all receipts for the sléepe, likewise all that is made of Poppie is good to procure sléepe, as the confection Diapapauer, Loch de papauere, Syrupus de papauere, and Diacodion. A powder. Take Lettice seede and white Poppie séede, of each halfe an ounce, Endiue séede,
Henbane séede and Ginger, of each one drag. Sugar foure ounces, make a powder thereof. But if all these things will not helpe, then must Opium of necessitie be vsed, to the end that nature may get some rest. But with what prouidence this is to be vsed, that do all experienced Phisitions sufficiently know, without whose counsell the same is not to be done. Of the ouerheated children, when they awake out of sleepe. TAke water Lillies or Purslaine, Willow leaues, Vine leaues, and Poppie séede with the heads, of each one handfull, let these séethe together in a pot of water, when it is then lukewarme set the child his féete therein, and stroke him well downwards, likewise also from the shoulders to the elbow. This ensuing is much more safe and expert than any thing else annointed on the temples of the head. Item make a cloth wet in his mothers milke, or if the same be not to be had, in warme Goates milke, lay thereof vpon the forehead, and on the temples of the head, it cooleth well, and also causeth to sléepe. Of Mania, another kind of franticknesse, which we commonly called Madnesse. §. 7. IT is discouered how that the Mania is a mad Phrenesis, without an ague, and is described by the learned, and defined after diuers manners, which are méete to be here rehearsed. Mania (some say) is a distemperature of the vnderstan∣ding, which altereth the right and reasonable thoughts, with losse of voice, of wit, and of iudgement, which were good in health. Other say thus, This Mania is a dottage or madnesse, and therfore a disease of the mind, which no otherwise distempereth the mind, but as any other sicknesse of the bodie, whereby can be no health. In fine, it is such a Melancholia, in case that it begin to roote in one, that they become raging mad, and must be bound, yea the common sort thinke no otherwise, but that he is possessed with a spirit. The chiefest signes of Mania be these, vnstedfastnesse, alterations in words and déedes done without sense or reason, like as much talke and prating, much waking, leaping, great troubles, and such like. But if they be caused of a cholerike Melancholia, then is the patient the more vnquiet, and so much the more inclined to chiding, calling, and great madnesse: but if it be mixt with burnt bloud, then do they only rage, and hold also their peace otherwhiles, the which cometh straight way againe afterwards with so wonderfull much talke, that they are hardly induced to hold their peace: they will be leane ouer all their bodie, they haue heauie dreames, spet out other∣whiles some gall, which falleth séething vpon the ground, their pulse is slow and weake, and their arteries hard. This is verily a terrible sicknesse, not onely for the patient himselfe, but for all them that doe assist and kéepe him: and is cured through the same means that are prescribed for Phrenitis, and for this Melancholia following. Of Melancholia, or Dementia, a wonderfull madnesse. §. 8. THis word Melancholia is to be taken after two waies: First, for one of the foure humors of a mans bodie, the blacke part of mans bloud, whereof we haue as yet not admonished. Secondly, for a certaine sicknesse which annoyeth & wea∣keneth the braine and mind, with great trouble and heauines: and is thus de∣scribed. Melancholia is a corruption of the iudgment and thoughts, altered from their naturall kind, into an vnnaturall and spoiled maner, tempered with feare and care: through which the blacke bloud causeth a troubled and changed spirit; like as it is also true, that it is common with all melancholicke persons (be it of whatsoeuer cause it will) to be alwaies fearefull and sorrowfull: and if you demaund of them the occasion, they know not to declare or alleadge any occasion vnto you: they be so full of fantasies & maruellous imagina∣tions.
Otherwhiles they be weary of their life; neuerthelesse they shun death: they complaine not any otherwise but that they be persecuted and murthered, or that some wild beasts will de∣uoure them; yea some be also moued in their wits; albeit that they feare death much, neuerthe∣lesse sometimes destroy themselues. Other also being infected with this disease, they fall into ri∣diculous fantasies: (for an example) like as we do read in Galen of one that had a strong imagi∣nation; so that he thought he was an earthen pot, and therefore shunned the way from all such as met him, fearing that they would breake him. There was another that so surely minded the fall of the Gyant Athlas, which should carrie heauen, that he thought that he also caried heauen, and was so weary thereof that he could no longer carrie so great a burthen, and yet would not cast it downe for feare he should bruse him selfe and all men in the world to fitters. Some suppose and imagine that they be Emperours, Kings, Wolues, Diuels, Foules, and what may be more: some weepe, some laugh, others shun the water. Also it hath béen séene be∣fore times that learned men being plagued with this disease, afterward did not know one let∣ter. To the contrary, vnlearned men did know wonderfull artes, could speake strange lan∣guages, who also prophesied: and others that did those things that séemed to be against nature. Some feare the things which be not to be feared, nor neuer can come to passe. But in this they be like to feareful men, yea all those men who alwayes feare darknesse: for like as such outward darknesse bringeth feare with it; so doth Melancholia also cause a darke blacke bloud, which ma∣keth darknesse in a bodies minde, and a feare withall. This is also a cause wherefore the melancholicke persons are easily possessed with the falling sicknesse. The cause of these melancholicke fantasies do procéede most from the nature of the meates which ingender melancholicke bloud; to wit, all Venison, but especially Hares, Conies, and all old flesh, whether it be of Oxen, Goates, Bucks, Kine, wild Oxen, and rather if they be salted than fresh. Also of great sea fishes, Salmons, Sturgeons, &c. The like also of all herbes which do not moysten, especially of Colewoorts, and all other Pottages, as Beanes, Lintels, Pease, &c. The blacke thicke Wine, old Chéese, vnleauened bread, and such like, do also increase Me∣lancholie. The melancholicke persons are also to beware of great labour, sorrow, heauie thoughts, much watching, from great hunger, and great thirst; and eschew also great cold, dry countries and dwellings. To the contrary is also good for them, young Mutton, Kids, Lambe, Pullets, Hens, fresh flesh broth, Egs, and whatsoeuer else is easily to be digested, and maketh good bloud, as Bur∣rage, Buglosse, &c. His bread must be white, light and well raised: To bath oftentimes without tarying long in it, is very meete for them. In like manner the hearing of musicke and all mirth, and all well sa∣uouring and odoriferous things caried about them: this is now a general rule for all those that be assailed with this Melancholie. But forasmuch as this griefe of the mind, or heauinesse, doth commonly procéede out of two parts of mans body, as out of the braines, and the Milt or Spléene; therefore is good héede to be taken, viz. when these grieuous thoughts and fantasies do assaile a body, as feare, sorrow, & also when anger doth get the masterie, then it is a signe that the Melancholie procéedeth out of the Spléene, and that the rather when it appeareth with swelling, & ache in the belly, loath∣some colour, lost appetite, and vomiting: if it then come so farre that the patient do disclose his thoughts in words or déeds, then it is a signe that the melancholie hath fast setled herselfe, and that it is high time to vse good aduise for it: for if this maladie do take roote, then it is vncurable. Therefore first the Liuer veine is to be opened in the hand; and if the bloud be blacke, then let it bléed as lōg as the sick person may suffer it: but if it be faire red, then stanch it presently againe. And if with this franticknes were not the foresayd signes, but that this Melancholy (according to the frensie) were caused through long continuance in the sunne, or that the patient be beaten on the head, then is his head veine to be opened, and he is also to vse purging, and meate as is before sayd; his head is to be irrigated with warme water from on high, and afterwards to be annointed with oyle of Roses, Vineger, and womans milke, and let him smell to things which
be coole of nature, as Roses, Violets, Sanders, Camfere, &c. In fine, that which is before pre∣scribed for frenzie, and in the first part of this booke for Cephalaea and Hemicrania, is also good for this purpose. And if so be that none of the foresaid signes be present or apparant, then doth the melancho∣ly not aggrieue the head only, but it hath also communion with the hart and liuer. For this, the Median must be opened, and the sicke person gouerned (as is said before) a certain space, other∣whiles holding vp and interceassing, and then to begin againe with phisicke, and continuing this so long, till he be throughly whole. Now in generall to write of this sicknesse, it is first to be noted, that no medicine is méet for this which purgeth by vomit, for because that the matter is heauie of it selfe, it doth couet to be purged by stooles, therefore it is good that he vse some preparatiue potions, according to the ad∣uice of a learned Phisition, and according as the patient is able. Some also commend for this a potion of Epithymus, thus prepared. A potion of Epithymus. THis decoction or potion do we here describe to be made after thrée manners, the which also is a sure signe that the same as well by the auncient Phisitions, as of later time, is of esti∣mation and price. The first maketh Rasis thus: take Mirobalans Indi one ounce and a quarter, the rootes of Polypodie fiue drag. Sene leaues nine drag. Turbith halfe an ounce, Epithymus 10. drag. séeth them all together (except the Epithymus) in 36. ounces of water; then at last cast in the Epithy∣mum, afterwards take it from the fire and let it coole: straine it, and reserue it. The second manner. Take Epithymum, Stechas, Mirobaloni Indi, of each one ounce, Miroba∣lani Chebuli, Emblici, Bellirici, Turbith, the hearbe Pyony and Agaricus, of each two dragm. and a halfe, Polypody rootes, and Sene, of each thrée drag. Fumitory, Squinant, of each one drag. and a halfe, rinds of black Hellebore roots one drag. Salgemme two scrup. Corants thrée quarters of an ounce; séeth them all together (except the Epithymum) in a pot of water a good space, then put thereto the Epithymum at the last, and let them séeth vntill thrée parts remaine: when it is luke∣warme, then straine it, and kéepe it in a cold place couered. The third manner. Take Fumitorie, Endiue, Cicorie, of each one handfull, rootes of Poly∣pody thrée quarters of an ounce, Cuscuta, Sorrell, Buglosse, of each one handfull, Thymus, Epi∣thymus, of each one ounce and a quarter, Corants one ounce, Dates & Figs, of each one ounce, Sene leaues 7. drag. Turbith thrée drag. Agaricus halfe an ounce, séeth them altogether in a pint and a halfe of water of Fumitorie, vntill the third part be spent; then straine it, and lay to stéepe in this warme decoction two drag. and a halfe of good Rubarbe, Rinds of Mirobalani Chebuli one drag. and a halfe, Indi one drag. let them stand together: wring it oftentimes out, and kéepe it vntill you haue néede of it. But before this potion, these pils are first to be vsed: Take Agaricus two scrup. Aloe one dra. Indy salt, halfe a drag. black Hellebore half a scr. make as many pils as you will with it for to take at twice. Three howers before the potion also you may in stead of these pils, vse the con∣fection, Hamech, or Diasena. When as now it hath thus bene continued certaine dayes (accor∣ding to the abilitie of the patient) then let him rest thrée daies, and liue soberly (drinking small white wine, and then purging againe as before) and so vntill foure times one after another, for (as is said before) melancholy is wonderfull hard to be purged. In fine, delay is in no wise méete, and the Phisition is to do his very best for to make the sicke person fat, for if that can be effected, then shall he quickly recouer his health. And if it chaunce that he could not vse this potion, then may he take in stead therof the pils which expell blacke Choler, yet to vse alwaies before some preparatiue medicine, for which you are according to the importance of the cause, to follow the aduice of a learned Phisition. This potion following is very conuenient, take Mirobalani Indi one ounce and a halfe, dried Prunes one ounce, séethe them together in 8. ounces of water, euen to the halfe: afterwards straine them through a cloth, then dissolue therin two ounces or two ounces and a half of Manna, and vse it in the morning betimes. All the time that he shall rest, may he vse these things, as Laeti∣ficans Almansoris,Laetificans Almansoris. the which is thus prepared: Take Balme, the pils of Citrons, Cloues, Galliae
Muscatae, Mace, Cinnamome, Nutmegs, Cardamome, red and white Behen, Pionie seed pil∣led, Seduarie great and small, Basill seede, of each one drag. and a halfe, Muscus nine graines, afterwards 20. Mirobalani, Chebuli, and 30. Emblici, powre twelue ounces of water theron, bray them so long in a mortar, vntill the fift part remaine: afterwards straine it through a cloth, and mixe therewith sixe ounces of cleare honie: seeth it so long, vntill all the water be consumed: waigh that which is ouerplus, and temper alwaies with twelue ounces of this decoction, one quarter of an ounce of the foresaid spices, or one ounce and a halfe in the whole quantitie, and then make a confection of it. But if you will haue tabulats or rotuls, take vnto twelue ounces of Sugar one ounce, or at the most nine drag. of the foresaid spices; you shall take of the confe∣ction the quantitie of a Hasell nut; it strengtheneth all the principall parts of mans bodie, and helpeth much the naturall warmth and concoction; it withstandeth all grieuous thoughts, and maketh also merrie, and a good colour. A very precious Confection. TAke Lignum Aloes, Cloues, Cardamome, Amarantus, which is burnt to powder, Roses, Burrage, and flowers of Buglosse, of each one quarter of an ounce, parched Hasell nuts halfe a dragme, sweete Almonds, and Iuiubes, of each one ounce, prepared fine Bolus 3. drag. Annis, Fennell, of each two ounces, Saffron two scrup. Doronicum, Harts bones, Seduary, Ia∣cinth, Smaragd, and Saphires, of each one scrup. prepared pearles one quarter of an ounce, Basill séede one drag. 8. leaues of beaten gold, you are to séeth this together in the iuice of Cha∣maedrios, of field Cypers, and iuice of Buglosse, of each thrée ounces, vntill all the iuice be consu∣med. But note, that the precious stones, gold, and Saffron must not be sodden with it, but be at the last tempered amongst it. Of this is to be giuen in the morning early thrée dragm. in a draught of wine before dinner and supper, one drag. and a halfe to eate, and halfe an ounce of conserue of Buglosse after it. This is especially fit for the burnt melancholie, of whatsoeuer oc∣casion the same doth procéede. If you will vse it also in Mania, minister it with the water of Violets, and of water Lillies. Now for to prouoke sléepe, you are to giue the decoction of Poppy heads, or lukewarme water of water Lillies one quarter of an ounce, and that two houres af∣ter supper. Another Confection. TAke burnt silke, prepared Corall, of each halfe a scrup. burnt Harts horne two scrup. pre∣pared Pearles one drag. Cardamome foure scrup. prepared Pingles two ounces, Hyssop, and Licorice, of each two scrup. Nutmegs, Cloues, Mace, Indie Spica, Cypers roots, Cucubes and Galingale, of each one drag. and a halfe, Cinnamom one quarter of an ounce, Saffron one scrup. white Sugar 24. ounces, séeth this with Buglosse water, vntill it be as thicke as honie, and then temper the rest with a little Muske amongst it. A Powder which is much commended. IT is said that it hath bene many times found, that they which had this melancho∣like passion, haue onely through this powder recouered health both of bodie and mind. Take Epithymum one ounce and a halfe, Azure stone, Agaricus, of each one quar∣ter of an ounce, Diagridion one drag. 20. Cloues, this being beaten together and tempered, you are twice a wéeke to giue thereof, but at the most one quarter of an ounce at once. Or you may vse for this the confection Diamargarition, and all that is described before for the strengthening of the head, and shall be described hereafter for the comforting of the heart. To moisten the drie braines in this Melancholia, take the broth wherein the head of a Weather, or the féete be de∣cocted: let certaine Poppie heads be sod flue or sixe waumes, and so lay thereof wet clothes v∣pon the head. Or take the flowers of Borage, of Buglosse, Thymus, Epithymus, of each a like quantitie, séeth this together, and wash the head therewith. Take the iuice of Borage, and of Fumitorie, of each sixe ounces, foment therewith the head
with a spoonge which is made wet therein: if you cannot get this iuice, then take the water of the same herbes. Néesing is also very fit for this vse: and that is to be prouoked like as is taught in the second Chapter and 2. §. The learned do aduise, that in this disease, after the purging, the head before and behind aboue the necke is to be cauterized euen to the very bone, and to hold the holes open the space of 14. dayes. In fine, to rehearse the whole manner of curing this Melancholie, it consisteth onely therein, that the black Melancholike blood is first and last to be purged, through all meanes possible. Also good héed is to be taken vnto the Liuer, and the phisicke to be ordained thereafter. Of the Palsey in generall. §. 9. THis is indéede a swift, grieuous and terrible disease, which (like as is said before) hath his ofspring from the brain. It is of diuers natures, each one worse then the other, which we will comprehend in fiue kinds: the first is Lethargus, which is the sléeping sicknesse: the second is Stupor or Tremor, which is astonishing and quaking, which some call the small pal∣sey: the third is Paralysis, that is, the right or dead Palsey: the fourth is Epilepsia, which is the falling sicknesse, and all kinds of such like paroxismes, sometimes in old men, and otherwhiles in young children: the fift is Apoplexia, that is the most grieuousest, which not without reason, we do call the power or hand of God. Because that these said sicknesses do resemble each other in many things, therfore we will before all briefly discouer what difference there is betwéene them, and wherein they do accord together. First therefore Apoplexia and Epilepsia, haue this difference, that the last mentioned is placed before in the head, the man fallen neither calleth nor cryeth out, the sinewes stirre, and are contracted towards the braine, he hath the breath almost wholly frée, and commeth quickly to himselfe againe. To the contrarie, the Apoplecticus, or he that is stricken with the dead Pal∣sey, the sicknes is ouer his whole head, cryeth in falling, the sinewes will be slacke, they haue a grieuous or no breath, and come slowly to themselues: but they resemble each other so like, that they be both caused of flegmaticke humors in the braine. The Palsey or Apoplexia, is also differing from the numbednesse and sléeping sicknes, which is Lethargus, Subeth, and Congelatio: but in Congelatione, there is no restraint of the breath, as there is in the Palsey: secondly, it forcibly assaileth the sicke persons; they thrust, crie out, and such like, which is nothing so cum Apoplecticis. Thirdly, that the sléeping disease commeth slowly, and the dead Palsey very sodainly. But herein they accord, that all they be altogether depriued of their vnderstanding. Subet or Stuper, doth therin disagrée with Lethargus and Congelatio, that at the last there assaileth in Lethargus an Ague, and an Impostume in the hinder part of the head: where contrariwise Subet or Stuper commeth without an Ague, and alwaies without any sorenesse, and in the forepart of ye head. Of the sleeping disease Lethargus, Veternus, Torpor. §. 10. THe nature of this disease is cleane contrarie to the foresaid frenzie: for that like as they be plagued with an immoderate watching; so are they in this sicknes vexed with an insa∣tiable sléeping. It beginneth first with an alteration in the colour in the skinne ouer the whole bodie, and with a féeble pulse, somtimes with a small, and otherwhiles with a great and hurtfull ague. It is also caused out of a cold moisture of the head and braines, wherby not only the vnderstanding is enféebled, but is for the most part alwaies so spoiled, that they vtterly for∣get all that they do speake, heare and sée. The which also the gréeke name Lethargus doth signi∣fie; for this cold slime doth through his toughnesse obstruct the hindmost tunicles of the braines, where the memorie hath her seate. Amongst many causes this is one of the commonnest, name∣ly, all that augmenteth melancholy, that causeth this sléepie sicknesse: but which they be, look in other places, viz. where the melancholie is described, which the first Register discouereth espe∣cially. This maladie is caused of all meate and drinke which ascendeth towards the head, as Onions, Garlicke, Penniroyall, Mustard (howsoeuer they be drest) and such like moe: Also if he ouercharge himselfe, liueth in filthinesse, sléepeth much, and especially lieth on the backe,
whereby that the heauie flegmatike vapors do ascend into the hindermost parts of the head, which do cause there otherwhiles an impostumation or deprauation of the vnderstanding, and sometimes much gaping or yawning. Here is also to be noted, that there be foure kindes of diseases contained and comprehended amongst these sléeping sicknesses. First, Lethargus it selfe; Congelatio, which is the numnesse; Stupor, that is, senslesnesse; Subet, which is called of the Arabians, a very déepe sléep. And although it appeare that all these be one kind of sort, neuerthelesse they haue notable differences. The numnesse and sléeping sicknesse do therein accord, viz. that they do both infect the hin∣der part of the braine, do take away vnderstanding, and all sensiblenesse, and preferre forget∣fulnesse. But they disagrée herein, that in Lethargo the eyes be shut; and in the numnesse they remaine open, like as is sufficiently shewed before in the 9. §. But to the end we might speake somewhat of their signes, these are the commonest; small continuall agues with a déepe sléepe, and the pa∣tient lyeth alwayes with closed eyes; if one call him, he openeth the eyes, & shutteth them close againe by and by; the pulse is strong, but slow and sweatie, with forgetfulnesse of all that is past and done, and of present things, yea in such manner, if they aske for meate and drinke, they forget to shut their mouth to: they draw their breth slowly, and with great trouble; the going to priuie or stoole is alwayes thin, the vrine thicke and troubled, as of a foure footed beast. If all these signes (or any of them) be marked, then it is easily to be adiudged, that it is none other but the sléeping disease. But if there befall something else with it (whereof it were too long to write) then do these foresayd signes alter and change. Now for the first meane all diligence is to be done, to let and stay that these sicke persons fall not in any déepe sléepe, through the strong binding of the outward members, like as is taught in the ninth Chapter and second §. and in other places of the Hissing of the eares, frothing and rubbing the same hard: also the plucking by the nose or beard, and women by the haire of their priuities, lowd crying, and making great noise, yea if it were néedefull, by fearing them, to the end they may be sorrowfull. Some Phisitions begin first the cure with letting bloud and opening of the head veine: and if there be no other occasions which may let and hinder it, few dayes after the veine on the fore∣head aboue the nose. They also do further ye bléeding at the nose, by thrusting in of swines bri∣stles and such other. Afterwards they vse strong Clisters, & two or thrée dayes afterwards née∣sing powder, for to expell sléepe therewith: and if all these will not helpe, then is one to looke if he can bring the patient to parbraking & vomiting, whether it be through thrusting in of his fin∣gers, feathers, plumes, or waxe candles into the throate, or through the iuice of Radishes tem∣pered with Oxymel, or taking a Radish, sticking here and there into it péeces of blacke Hellebore layd al night in a celler, taking out the rootes in the morning, and boyling the Radish in water, and straining it through a cloth: tempering therein one dragme of Saffron and foure ounces of vineger, whereof two spoonefuls are to be giuen him immediatly after meate. The order of diet. BIcause that this maladie is short, and inclineth spéedily to life or to death; therefore is no great héede to be taken for meate and drinke in this sicknesse: but thin Meade must be his onely drinke, for it digesteth and expelleth. Also he is to occupie the broth of Fitches and Barly decocted with Hen broth: it is a commodious meate for him; but of all fruites, and meates of cold nature, he must beware. But as much as concerneth the foresayd Clisters, we shall speake thereof when we discourse of the Apoplexia: for thereby be the braines discharged from all that hurtfull matter. You must also in stead of the same, vse these suppositories: Take stone salt, and beaten Beuercod, of each one dragme, clarified Honie two ounces: make méetely thicke and long suppositories of it. For to purge, this ensuing is very requisite: Take Hiera Picra halfe an ounce, Honie water three ounces; it is thin and bitter: or breake the Pils Cochiae one dragme, sirupe of Roses one ounce, in thrée or foure ounces of hony water: also he must drinke sometimes of this hony wa∣ter following: Take foure parts of water, and one part of hony, séeth it so long as it will cast
vp any scum. The aboue mentioned Oxyrrhodinum thrée dayes together laid vpon the head is also much commended. Or make this water, Stechas, Rue, Marioram gentle, Marioram, Bay leaues, Hyssop, and Nep, of each halfe a handfull: séeth them all together in sufficient wa∣ter vnto the halfe: dip a spoonge therein, and apply it warme to the head. This foresaid water may from on high be irrigated vpon the head, and the hearbes being wrung out to be layd in a little bag on the top of the head. Item, take Pigeon dung, temper it with Hony, and so lay it vpon the head; you must rub well the necke with Lilly rootes or with Squils. For this are also good all these oyles ensuing vsed each by it self or mixed together, as the oyle of Beuercod, of Spike, of Piretrum, of Mustard séede, and oyle of Bayes, the iuice of Rue, or the hearbe decocted in Wine, and laid in the neck, is very highly commended. Because then the causes require (like as is said) that the head be purged through néesing, take the things whereof we haue at sundrie times spoken, like as the first Register shall shew thée: if it be néedfull to purge yet more, you haue further instructions for it in the foresaid pla∣ces, where we haue discoursed of the Palsey. Lastly, the patients haire is to be shorne off, and afterwards he must haue the head annoin∣ted with a salue of Mustard séede, Beuercod, and Vineger tempered together, for it is strong and hote for to consume all melancholicke humors in the hinder part of the head. There may also those things be vsed for it which are ordained for the Palsey, which be worthie of obseruation. Of Numnesse and Astonishing, which is Stupor, Congelatio, whereon dependeth Tremor, which we call trembling. §. 11. THe second kinde of this sléeping disease haue we ascribed to Stupor and Tremor, that is, the numnesse and trembling which commonly follow each other. What the first is for a disease, that is discouered in the beginning of this our booke, viz. a strong cold, which comprehendeth the hinder part of the head (like to Lethargus) and maketh vnmoueable and senslesse the partie affected, and therefore is likened therein to the Paralysi, for that also (as is sayd) it is called a small Paralysis or Palsey. In this sicknesse the patient lyeth none otherwise then as if he slept, but hath the eyes open, and stirreth neither the eye lids, nor any other member of the bodie. If they do get this numnesse, as they stand, they remaine standing, or as stiffe as a sticke: if they get it writing, so do they continue sitting, as if they wrote: or if they get it with looking into the Skie, so they also remaine séeing without any alteration; whereby then the common people do get an vnbeléefe, saying, that they be taken away, and that they speake with God or with an Angell: amongst which otherwhiles Sathan doth mingle his wilinesse, whereby some do take and hold them for Saints, like as they sometimes shew foorth, that they haue seene maruels in Purgatorie and in heauen. In fine, these be likened to Idols, that do not see with open eyes, do not smell, nor heare, do not speake with open throate, neither go on their legs, like as the Psalme saith. This numnesse or stifnesse doth also most commonly take one in their sléepe, that is, if any one haue a leg or a foote stiffe, like as the learned and we also call it stéeping, and hath lost for the space of a certaine time his féeling, and motion, the which hapneth if that one mem∣ber lye too hard vpon the other, whereby the vitall spirits are kept backe: but with what infir∣mities of the braine this numnesse agréeth, is sufficiently before rehearsed and shewed. This disease is to be holpen as the sléeping sicknesse Subet is cured, as you find written in the first Chapter §. 6. and afterwards of Cephalaea: but for this is especially commanded not to tarry long from taking of good aduise, for that if one let this numnesse grow old, then follow∣eth after it a perfect palsey. Therefore, if any bodie haue their féete or other member benumned, or will waxe stiffe, then are the remedies to be vsed for it, which are good for the palsy, and those that shall be here∣after described, and a good diet to be obserued in eating and drinking. Also all such meates to be chosen which be warme and drie by nature, as Pullets with their brothes, and all other Fowls which make their abode in the hilly country. If this patient may also be brought to sweating, it would be very good. The neck and all other stifned members are euery where to be annointed
with Dialthaea, or Martiaton: for this is also good oyle of Costus, with a little Benercod tempered amongst it, which is speciall good for trembling. But if the maladie waxe old, then purge with the pils Cochijs, and vse otherwhiles the confection Anacardina, which is also much commended for the same: or take the oyle of Elderne flowers one ounce and a halfe, temper it amongst one quarter of an ounce of Euphorbium, and annoint the head therewith. In like manner the head may also be annointed with the oyle of Elderne leaues, Beuerrod, and of Euphorbium, or vse this water following, which is more milder. Take Burrage, Buglosse, Fumitorie, Stechas, Tymus, Tymiama, of each halfe a handfull: séethe them all together in sufficient water, and let the head be therewith irrigated warme, or made moist with a spoonge. The néesing is also very requisite, and this is to be done in the numnesse or stifnesse with blacke Hellebore, by reason that the same vehemently riddeth away al melancholy, wherof two kinds are here described. Clisters are also very commodious for this kind of numnes, take Mercurie, Balme, Sene leaues, rootes of Polypody, Burrage, Buglosse, Annis séedes, and Fennell séeds, of each halfe a M. Also take Bran, séeth all these together in sufficient water, and take thereof 12. or 16. ounces. Temper amongst it Hiera Ruffi, Logodionis, of each halfe an ounce, oyle of Rue foure ounces, salt halfe a drag. then make a Clister thereof. The second. Take Burrage, Buglosse, both the rootes and hearbes, Fumitory, Mercury, of each one M. Cuscuta, Fennell, Tymus, Tymiama, Stechas, and Amaranthus, of each halfe a M. also a little Bran: séeth this altogether, and take of this decoction as much as before: afterwards put more thereto, oyle of Lillies, and Honie, of each one ounce and a halfe, Salgemma, one drag. Hiera logodion, or Ruffi, thrée quarters of an ounce more or lesse according as the patients abi∣litie requireth. Of the shaking Palsey. §. 12. COncerning the shaking Palsey, the which is a kind of this forementioned dis∣ease, it is therefore added to the numnesse, for that they both procéede from one kind of cause. There be diuerse spices of this, which are here especially reckoned amongst the contagions of the braines, although they be caused through some offence or perishing of the sinewes, and are thus described: The shaking is a continuall strife of the naturall powers, which willingly and after a naturall manner are raised without ceasing, and is ouercome by sicknesse. Also, this shaking is a weakening or diminishing of mo∣tion. This hapneth of many causes, as if one looke from great height into the depth, or like as any body should speake to a seuere Prince, a Tyrant, or any other great Sir, or Ruler; or if one sée any deuouring beast before his eyes. Also this shaking or trembling commeth of great anger, great ioy, hard binding, through great cold and darknesse, like as daily experience shew∣eth. Item through great heate, vnbridled incontinencie, much bléeding, and also when there is little bloud and spirit extant, as one séeth by them which be recouered of a long sicknes. But be∣cause that it plainly appeareth by the foresaid reasons, that this disease is caused by diuers meanes and accidents, therfore there be generally diuers remedies appropriate vnto it, wher∣fore if it procéede of perishing of the sinewes, and cold causes (like as it most commeth to passe) then is to be vsed for it all that is ordained for the Crampe and Palsey. Generally of all other hearbes there is praysed for this, Thrée leaued grasse, Comin, and Stechas, whether it be in Clisters or otherwise: of oyles, the oyle of wild Cucumbers, of Dill, of Cleauers, Articocae, which hearbe is maruellous forcible against the shaking or trembling. For his meate, are very méete for it the braines of Hares, yong Stares, and yong Beuers, and also for all other diseases of the sinewes. These Clisters following are also to be vsed, take Centorie, wild and garden Sage, Rue and Cowslips, S. Iohns woort, and Mercury, of each halfe a M. also péeled wild Saffron séed one drag. Rue séed, Basill seede, siluer mountaine séede, of each halfe an ounce, Agaricus fiue drag. Stechas and Amaranthus, of each halfe an ounce: let them seeth together in sufficient water, take 12. or 16. ounces of this decoction, Hony, and oyle of Lillies, of each one ounce and a halfe, Sal gemma, Pil. Cochiae, of each halfe a drag. temper them well for a Clister, this is also good for the palsey and stifnesse: but if the trembling come of
excesse drinking of wine, then is the same to be forborn, or at least tempered with Sage water, or common water wherein Sage is decocted: Meade is much more méete for this then wine, or common water tempered with the iuice of Pomegranates, or Veriuice. There is also to be de∣manded, what the cause is, that the head alwaies shaketh most of all, and next after the hands: like as by experience is séene. The answer: For that the braine is a very flegmaticke part, the which imparteth her moisture to the other members. And for that the hands are next of all to the head with their sinewes, & far from the naturall warmth: they are also most annoyed with outward causes, for that they be seldome couered. Now that one may chiefly helpe this shaking of the head, (out of which might procéede much damage) first is the patient to eschew all moist and cold meate, as fish, and especially sodden Crabbes and Eeles. He is also to refraine from Spinage, Béetes, Purslaine, Cucumbers, and such like hearbes, and all that is made of dowe, except leauened bread. Item, from all sorts of pottages, except red and white pease, and Rise. All fruit is also hurtfull vnto him, except Oranges and Limons which be preserued. Milke, and all that is made of milke is he to shun like poison; and if he loue his health, he must drinke no wine. But his meate is to be wheaten bread with the bran: Also Veale, Kids flesh, and leane powdered flesh, Fennell, Mints, Rosemarie, Sage, wild Time, yellow Rapes, Parsneps, Ca∣pers, and such like, are also very commodious. For his drinke is this to be prepared; take sixe quartes of fresh Well water, and one ounce of dried Rosemarie flowers; let it séethe vntill two quartes be wasted: afterwards temper thereto foure and twentie ounces of Honie, let it then séeth againe, and scum it well, vntill there be about a quart consumed: Afterwardes straine it through a tight cloth, and let him drinke thereof in steade of wine: but if he cannot well drinke it, then temper a little red cleare wine amongst it. But if so be that he must and will drink wine, then take Rosemarie wine; for it strengtheneth the members, and also the sinewes, whether it be drunken, or the members rubd with it. The same doth also the wine of Clarie, Sage, and Wormwood, but aboue all others Rosemarie wine. But if so be that the person be young & full of bloud, then after the vse of the foresaid Clisters open the Liuer veine in the elbowe, or vpon the hand, and let out of it foure or fiue ounces of bloud, and the next day afterwards let him take these pils following: as Cochiae, de Sarcocolla, of each halfe a drag. with the iuice of Roses, whereof are seuen pils to be made, and he must fast af∣ter them fiue howers. Also to drinke afterwards a good draught of warme wine, and an hower after he is to breake his fast. After purging he is to drinke euery morning this potion following the space of a moneth, and to fast foure houres after it. Take water of Artichokes, of Betonie, and Rosemarie of each one ounce, sirupe of Stechas and Oxymel, of each thrée quarters of an ounce: and once in twelue daies he is to vse these pils following: as Pill. foetidarum, two scrup. Cochiarum one scrup. whereof you are to make with the sirupe of Roses seuen pils, euery eue∣ning when he goeth to bed he is to eate one quarter of an ounce of Calmus, and thereupon to drinke a draught of Artichoke water. He is also from the necke downewards to the rumpe a∣long the backe bone, to be rubbed with warme clothes, and thereupon annoint it with the oile of Artichokes. He is also to drinke halfe a drag. of the powder of a Hares head burned, and that one houre before meate, with Meade, or water of Artichokes. Now after that the patient is well purged, then may he euery day two or thrée houres before meate, set boxing cups vnpickt behind in the necke. A Powder. TAke field Cypers, Cowslips, Lignum Aloes, Ireos, Hermodactils, Stechas, Marioram, Mints, of each halfe a dragme, Indy Spica, Graines and Rue, of each one scruple: this beaten each by himselfe, and then tempered, bestrew all the head therewith when it is shorne. The Confection of Diamargariton. THis Confection following is very méete for all manner of shaking: it doth maruellously strengthen the heart in all venimous accidents, and is amiable to the stomacke. Take Cinnamom, Lignum Aloes, Cloues, Indy Spica, Galingall, Licorice, Trociscos de Ʋio∣lis sine Scammonio, Specierum, Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each fiue drag. Nutmegs, Aliptae muscatae, Se∣duarie,
Spiknard, Mace, Rubarbe, and red Storax, of each halfe an ounce, prepared Pearles, burnt Iuorie, Harts bones, Ginger, Blatia Byzantia, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Mus∣cus, Ambra, Cardamom, Louage seede, Basill séede, of each one dragme and a halfe, Camfere one dragme and thrée ounces of clarified Honie: temper these all togither, and you shall giue thereof early in the morning, and as often as is needefull in the day time; to wit, one quarter of an ounce at once. If you will then haue Tabulats thereof, then take twelue ounces of Sugar, and one ounce of the foresayd ingredience: seeth Sugar with Lauander water; or if you desire it more cooler, then take Buglosse water, there is also at many Apothecaries Diamargariton frigidum, which is yet more cooling, because that the former is of a warme nature. Against the trembling or shaking are all Aquae Comp. good, which are described in the eighth part, taking thereof, or the trembling member washed or rubbed therewith. Item take Garlike, beate it with wine, and rub the shaking members with it: In like man∣ner also, with the iuice of wild Cucumbers, tempered with oyle of thrée leafed grasse, or vsed by it selfe. Take a sponge which groweth on the Iuniper tree in May, before the rising of the sun: put it into a glasse, set it in the sunne, and then will it change to water; wherewith wash the sha∣king and trembling hands, and let them dry of themselues. There is much taught in the second part, of the palpitation of the heart, which is also méete for this shaking. For the Resolution of the sinewes or dead Palsey. §. 13. OF the third kinde of Palsey we haue told heretofore in the beginning of the 8. §. of the Resolution in the sinewes, what manner of sicknesse it is that doth sodainly take away the frée motion and action of a part in mans body particularly, or whol∣ly, and maketh it dead & insensible. We do call the same a resolution of the sinewes, or a dead Palsey, and them that be troubled with it, Paralyticos. This is now called by the learned, the great or dead Palsey or Resolution, for a difference of the foresayd trembling and shaking. In this are two kindes of natures hidden; whereof the one is Epilepsia, when it taketh the left or right side, and not all the whole body, & is called in Latin Resolutio, or Dissolutio neruorum, that is, a resolution or vnbinding of the sinewes, that the members haue no strength or might in them, whereof we will here speake more at large, for this Palsey concerneth not the head at all: for if so be that the head be therewith infected, then is it a right Apoplexie. The Palsey or Resolution, whereof we at this present do speake, hath many causes: first, it is properly caused of cold moyst meates, as fish, Swines flesh, Milke, and all that is dressed therewith: all fruits, except Almonds, Hasel nuts, and Pistaces: also all cold herbes, as Béets, Spinage, &c. In fine, all that is moyst and cold is hurtfull for this sicknesse. But if one will eate fish, Porke, and red Pease, then are they to be prepared with Rosemarie, wild Time, Mints, Sage, and such like. The surfetting with meate and drinke, is in this sicknesse very preiudicial, like as also much sléeping, and chiefly for all them that be of a cold nature, and be old, or dwell in a cold or moyst countrey. This disease may also proceede of beating, or racking of the sinewes, of anger, of feare, great cold, hard binding of any of the members, and such like more. For this, all drying and warming meates are good; as well salted and leauened bread, Partridges, Fesants, Turtle doues, and all small foules: also Mutton and Veale drest with the foresayd herbes. Some com∣mend much Kids flesh salted, the which should strengthen much the sinewes. For this is also meete all kind of drying and warming Conserues, whether they be of rootes, herbes, flowers, or spices: but wine is to be refrained as much as is possible. But in case that the patient, by rea∣son of his age, cannot forbeare wine, then chuse old red wine, which he is to drinke tempered with a little Rosemarie water: and if that like him not, then he may drinke Rosemarie water alone, whether it be decocted or distilled. If the red wine be against him or not to be gotten, then take thin white wine, and temper it with water wherein Cardamome is decocted. Now all they that will be defended from this Palsey, they are to vse much confected Co∣riander, fasting and before meales; as also to vse white prepared Mustard séede therewith. For this is also very good the bloud of Turtle doues drunken. This sicknesse commonly ap∣peareth
with a new and full Moone, against which you are to prepare these things following. Take good Treacle thrée quarters of an ounce, Beuercod one quarter of an ounce, and tem∣per it with Lauander water, and take it in the morning fasting. But if so be there appeare any beginning of this sicknesse, then do many aduise (and that rightly) that then the thumbe and great toe are to be hard rubbed, chafed and stretched out; and likewise to rub with warme clothes the necke and the backe bone downwards, that the bloud may be drawne from the head and from the heart. Also there must be a little Treacle thrust be∣hind in his throate. Beuercod holden in the mouth and vnder the tongue is also very good. Some do also giue Beuercod and Pepper to drinke, of each one drag. For this is also much commended Asa foetida, whether it be taken inwardly, vsed on the outside, or in gargarismes: and if you would take the same, then is one drag. and a half enough, with Pepper and Rue, of each halfe a drag. tempered with wine. This is good for all diseases of the sinewes. The distilled water of blacke Cherries is also much praised for this sicknesse at the first, and especially if one put thereto as much Lauander water, and so take thereof thrée or foure ounces at one time. The common order of this sicknesse is, that all remedies for this disease are applyed to the hinder part of the head, and in the beginning before the fourth and seuenth, or also before the fourtéenth day to vse no strong medicines, but onely preparatiues. And if so be that the sicke person will yéeld vnto it, then it were not amisse that he drunke no other thing the first foure or fiue daies, and did eate almost nought else but only hony water, yea also (if it be possible) to suf∣fer hunger and thirst with it. The fourth day he is to haue giuen him one drag. or a drag. and a halfe of Treacle or Mithridate, with waters méete for this disease. It is also found by experience, that all they that be burthened with this disease, shall get great ease, if they accustome to drinke euery morning thrée ounces of Rosemarie or Lauander water, with three drag. of the powder of Pieretrum tempered amongst it. Item take the water of the blossomes of the Tillet trée, of May Lillies, and of blacke Cher∣ries, of each one ounce, giue it him so to drinke. In like manner also stilled womans milke is highly commended for it, and all kinds of Aquae Compos. Take ced Licorice, and Annis seedes, of each one ounce, Elecampane halfe an ounce, Pyo∣nie rootes one drag. Nutmegs one ounce, Spirit of wine sixtéene ounces, Hony eight ounces: temper these all together and conserue them well. In winter put thereto one quarter of an ounce of long Pepper, vse thereof euery morning a spoonefull or twaine. This is maruellous much commended for a speciall remedie. Another. TAke Lauander water sixe ounces, water of the May Lillies thrée ounces, Elixer vitae, and the water of wild Poppey, of each two ounces, oyle of Beuercod one ounce and a halfe; temper it in a glasse, and then set it in the Sun the space of eight dayes, whereof in time of néede take a spoonefull, and annoint therewith the temples of the head. M. Tristrams water is also very fit for this purpose. Of Purging. FOrasmuch as purging is very néedfull in this sicknesse, therefore for example will we de∣scribe here a purgation. But it is aboue all aduised, yt the sick body drink euery morning foure or fiue daies together fiue ounces of Rosemary water, and fast foure houres vpon it. Afterwards he is to take halfe an ounce of Hiera logodion, tempered in two ounces of Agri∣monie water, in the morning, and to fast fiue houres after it; or to vse these pils following: take Agaricus a scrup. Asa foetida half a scrup. Ginger twelue graines, Diagridion one graine: make pils thereof with the iuice of Hyssope. When the patient is purged, then he is to vse this potion following, for the space of eight daies together: Take the water of Agrimonie, and of Sothern∣wood, of each two ounces, put some Sugar amongst it.
Other do rather aduise this following: Take Calmus halfe an ounce, Cowslips thrée M. Saint Iohns woort, field and garden Sage, Betonie, Balme, Rue, Bay leaues, of each one M. Siluer mountaine, Balsame wood, Balsame fruite, and Basill séede, of each one quarter of an ounce, Licorice, Corants, Lauander flowers, Amaranthus, of each one ounce, clarified Honie sixe ounces, rayn water which is clarified with the white of an egge, twelue ounces; let all these séeth together vnto a sirupe. Another. TAke Calmus sixe ounces, Sage thrée M. Stechas thrée ounces, clarified hony sixe oun∣ces, white Sugar nine ounces; séeth them together in eightéene ounces of raine water vnto a sirupe, wherof you may take one ounce and a halfe, or two ounces at once, tempe∣red with Sage water. Also you may vse the sirupe of Stechas, for all they be very commodious for this disease. After∣wards take the former purgation againe, or the pils of Euphorbium, de Serapino, & de Opopanaco. And if the patient by drinking of these potions do remaine bound in bodie, then is he euery eue∣ning before supper to swallow one of these pils following. Take of the pils of Alephanginae one drag. Trocisci Alhandali, Agaricus, of each halfe a scrup. In∣die salt fiue graines, whereof make sixtéene pils. Clisters. TAke Sage, Rue, Stechas, Centorie, Mallowes, Mercurie, and Bran, of each halfe a hand∣full: let them séeth all together, and take twelue ounces of this decoction; temper a∣mongst it Hiera logodion halfe an ounce, Salt one quarter of an ounce, Sallad oyle three ounces, minister it warme. But for them that haue newly gotten this dead Palsey, there is to be sodden in these Clisters, halfe an ounce of rootes of Brionie, or of Pyonie, for both these are good for the disease. Powder for sauce to meate. THis powder is he to strew vpon the meate in stead of spice: Take pickt Cinnamom one ounce an a halfe, prepared Coriander, Cloues, Galingall, Pepper, Cucubes, Mace, Nut∣megs, of each one ounce, Calmus two ounces, Coutchenell halfe an ounce, Sugar sixe ounces: this is to be tempered together. Another. TAke Pepper two drag. and a halfe, Cloues, Cardamome, long Pepper, Seduarie, of each one dragm. Indy Spica, Mace, Saffron, of each one scrup. Sugar as much as you please: temper them well together. Item, about the third day is the patient before the rising of the Sun, to take one dragm. of Treacle tempered with the water of wild Sage. This medicine is most highly commended of diuerse Phisitions. Of Bathing. IN this sicknesse is also bathing much commended; whereof there be two kindes naturally, as sea water; or that is sulferish by nature: Others which be prepared with herbes and such like. For the herbe bath: Take the same hearbes, rootes, and séedes, which be named in the last si∣rupes, and one is onely to receiue the vapor, and sweate withall: or make this ensuing. Take Bay berries, Iuniper berries, and Pepper, of each as much as you please, stampe it to grosse powder, and set the patient in a drie bath: powre of this powder on hot irons, tempred with Lauander water, to the end he may sweate well with the vapor thereof, then rub all his members infected with Venice Sope, vntill the Sope be drie againe: Also his bodie is not to be
made wet at any time with any thing, but onely as he steppeth out of the bath with Lauander water, which is to be powred on a glowing Iron, and so moisten him with this vapour. And after bathing, tarying in a warme place, the lame ioynts are to be rubbed hard with the grease of Storkes, vntill they be drie; and afterwards with the sewet of a Wether; and lastly with Buckes sewet. This being continued so the space of foure dayes, the great veine on the foote is to be opened, and boxing cups set vpon the armes: then will he be holpen. An especiall Bath. TAke a Foxe, vncase him, and (the bowels being taken out) séeth him in a sufficient quanti∣tie of water, and bath the sicke person with it: but yet not before that the bodie be purged, it is not otherwise permitted. Fomentations in steade of Bathes. TAke Sage sixe M. Iuniper berries foure M. the strong wine lées seuen quarts; let them séeth together by a small fire: afterwards put it all together in a necessarie kettle or pot, to the end the vapor thereof may euaporate and ascend vnto the lame member, and vse this so twice euery day. Item, take drie Sage thrée M. séethe it in a pint of raine water vntill the third part be sod∣den away: at the length cast therein one ounce and a halfe of Stechados, let it séeth a waume or two: then temper amongst it halfe a pint of wine, or salt water, with halfe so much white wine, clarified honie two ounces: annoint and rub therewith the lame members. This (and other moe which follow hereafter) is approoued for this disease, if one cannot get the naturall bath, or will not vse artificiall bathes, which is alwaies to be vsed before the annointing, therewith be∣fore hand to open the pores. Take a hote Tile, sprinkle it with good strong wine, receiue the vapors vnto the lame mem∣bers, when they then be warmed and besweated, drie them with warme clothes, and annoint them with some of the foresaid things, now with the one, & then with the other, and couer well the lame members with a good woolfes furre, or with somewhat like vnto it. In like manner it is also good to rub the lame side with good burnt wine, or spirit of wine onely, or halfe so much white wine tempered amongst it: but if you will haue it yet more forci∣ble, then take in the stead of the spirit of wine, one of these Elixers vitae following. A water for Inunction. TAke Rosemarie, Marioram gentle, and Bay berries, of each one handfull, Venice Sope as much as the yolke of an egge, sixe ounces of Lauander water, temperall these together in a mortar, and let it stand a day: afterwards wring it through a cloth, the which is thus to be vsed: First rub the member well with a warme cloth, and annoint the water vpon it. Also he is twise a wéeke for to swallow or slide downe, 9. or 11. prepared Mustard séedes, and to drinke thereupon two or thrée ounces of Lauander water, and so to continue this the space of thrée weekes: otherwhiles he may annoint the lame side with the oile of Iuniper, but not too often: for thereby might come great hurt. The oile of Costus is also especially recom∣mended for this vse, which is thus made. Oile of Co∣stus.Take the rootes of Costus one ounce, Pepper, Pieretrum, Euphorbium, of each eight scruples, Beuer cod halfe an ounce, melt these all together in sixe ounces of the oile of Wall flowers, or in oile of Bay which is more forcible. Another. TAke powned Pieretrum, half an ounce, seeth it in sixe ounces of Sallad oile, vntill the third part be consumed, let the sicke person be annointed therewith foure times in fower and twentie howers: it is much commended of all auncient and later Phisitions.
A maruellous Oile called Hypobalsamus. THis oyle is most highly commended for the dead palsey, and for all resolutions of the sinewes, and is thus made: Take cleare Turpentine sixe ounces, oyle of Bayes one ounce, Galbanum, Gummi Helenij, of each thrée ounces, Gummi Hederae, Olibanum, Lig∣num Aloes, of each one ounce, Masticke one quarter of an ounce, Myrrhe, Laudanum, Aloes, Beuer cod, of each thrée dragmes, powne it grosse; then ad vnto it two ounces of spirit of wine, let it stand thrée dayes, afterwards take Galingale, Cloues, Cinnamom, Nutmegs, Zedua∣rie, Cucubes, of each one quarter of an ounce, Diptamus, Comfrey, of each one ounce and a halfe: powre theron two ounces of spirit of wine: let it stand so foure dayes, stirring it often∣times about, distill it afterwards in a glasse helme. This water is called also Balme water, which must be preserued alone, so also do with the oyle: for it swageth and strengtheneth all the sinewes maruellous much. For this is also méete the oyle of Marierom gentle, the oyle of Iuniper, of wild Cucumbers, of Tyles, and two precious balmes which shall be hereafter described in the eight part, which are especiall good for the lame members. This salue following is very good for all lame hands: Take Lauander, Sage, of each one handfull, Iuniper berries thrée ounces, séeth all togither in wine, and rub the fingers and other members with it. And if you will haue this more forcible, temper it with the former oyles vnto a thin salue, which is wonderfully commended. Another. TAke Squils, Rue, Calmus, Nettle rootes, Agrimonie, Cowslips, of each a handfull, powne them all togither, and powre oyle of Nuts vpon it, and old Sallad oyle foure and twentie ounces, and well salted water or wine as much also: let these séeth togither vntill the moisture be wasted away, wring it hard through a cloth, and temper amongst it Saltpeter, Euphorbium, Pepper, oyle of Bay, of each one ounce and a halfe, Galbanum, Turpentine, of each two ounces, Waxe as much as is néedefull for to make a salue thereof. This is maruellous good against the Crampe, against the cold Gowte, and whatsoeuer ache else may procéede of cold. Also you may make of all the foresayd oyle, salues, if you temper amongst it any grease of Beares, of Badgers, wild Cats, Hens, and Géese, of which you will. Item take Calmus, the rootes of Lillies, rootes of Costus, of each halfe an ounce, Pepper Pieretrum, Beuercod, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sage thrée dragmes, Stechas one dragme and a half, Spicanardi, Squinant, of each one dragme, and the iuice of Cowslips which is well set∣led one ounce, of the oyle of Indie nut kernels, of the oyle of crabs, & wine, of each thrée ounces: afterwards powne all that is to be powned, the rest are to be brused by themselues: séeth this by a mild fire so long, vntill the wine be consumed, afterwards put as much waxe vnto it as is néedfull for the salue. Item, it is reported that this salue ensuing doth preserue men from the dead Palsey: Take Bay leaues, Marioram, Rosemarie, Sage, Costus rootes, Scariola, Mints, Millet, Consolida mi∣nor, Sanicle, of each one M. Spicanardi, broad and picked Plantaine, Agrimonia, Buglosse, and Rue, of each one M. and a halfe, Wormewood, Smallage, Saint Iohns woort, red and white Roses, of each two M. Hyssope, nettles, and Tansey, of each halfe a handfull: beate them al to∣gither, and séeth them in thrée pound of fresh butter, vntil all the iuice be consumed: afterwards straine it through a cloth, and temper amongst it white molten Waxe thrée ounces, Masticke two ounces, Sallad oyle one ounce, and make thereof a salue. This is also good to preserue one from the Gowte. Another Salue highly commended. TAke a pluckt Goose, taking cleane out all the intrails, and wash it with vineger; after∣wards make a dow of Sage, Frankinsence, Mastick, powned Earth wormes, Wolues and Cats grease, fill the Goose therewith, and let her be gently rosted: the fatnesse which
droppeth off is to be gathered in a pot, with some vineger. This is a very piercing salue, which doth maruellously resolue and consume all hardnesse. But if the Wolues or Cats grease can∣not be gotten, then take shéepes suet in stead thereof, and annoint the necke and lame members therewith. It is also very requisite after the vse of this salue, to weare a plaister vpon the lame member, whereto this following is very méet: Take sixe ounces of the iuice of Rue, which is very cleare, and Pigeons dung as much as is néedfull for to make a plaister. This plaister is to be laid on the lame part. Also you shall many times find many kinds of remedies mo in the fourth part, of the lame∣nesse and extenuation of the members. To be noted. IN this Resolution or Palsey, are two principall members, which are to be healed with the foresaid oyles, waters, salues, and plaisters, viz. the member which is taken, and the be∣ginning of the sinewes which are next to the same member. Take for example, if the Pal∣sey or Resolution is in the one hand, then is the same, and all the parts of the backe, from the necke vnto the huckle bone to be annointed, for that the sinewes of the hand haue their ofspring from thence. Further, boxing cups vnpickt are to be applyed vpon the beginning of the sinewes, which do also helpe well, because that they do warme and drie them: it is good also to rub the same pla∣ces with Salt, Nettles, and Mustard seed. But alwaies after purging certaine daies together, whilest that the patient stayeth and ceaseth from purging, bathing, and such like, then is he to take euery morning halfe an ounce of the confection Anacardina, for that it is commended aboue all measure in the cold Palsey: and if so be that there be any sweate or small Ague with it, (like as accustometh to happen, which his heate causeth) then it is a good signe: but if this follow not, then is the patient to forbeare ten daies long from all vse of Phisicke, and to continue only with good meate and drinke. It is also here to be noted, that all that is described before, is only fit for the resolution which procéedeth of cold causes: but if they procéede of hote causes, the sicknes will be augmented tho∣rough the foresaid remedies. Palsey through fals or blowes. IF so be that one do fall so hard, or be beaten or stricken, that thereby forthwith he be taken with the Palsey, then it is not to be holpen: but if it come slowly afterwards vpon one, the this salue is very méet for it. Take Beuercod two scrup. Euphorbium one scrup. Pepper thrée graines, Pieretrum halfe an ounce: séeth all these in ten ounces of Sallad oile vnto the halfe, then temper with it fiue drag. of Brimstone, and a little wine: It is also especiall good for the Spasmus or Crampe. Item, take Myrrhe, Opopanacum, of each fiue dragm. Beuercod thrée dragm. Euphorbium one quarter of an ounce, oyle of Lillies, and of Narcissus, of each two ounces, make a strong plaister thereof with waxe, and spread it vpon a cloth, and lay it vpon the place aggrieued. But good héed is alwaies here to be taken of the lamenesse (and of all that might concerne the same) with heate or without heate, like as we haue alreadie admonished, that it may be known to apply the remedie thereafter. Lauander, Rosemarie, Spicanardi, (which haue almost the same operation) are inestimably good for the Resolution which procéedeth through cold causes. Therefore all conserues which be made thereof, are not onely profitable for these causes, but also for all lost spéech and lamed limmes. If so be that any will vse any wine in this sicknesse, then is there none fitter nor bet∣ter then wine of Rosemarie, or Wormwood wine. Conserue of Sage and of Cowslips are also much commended; with other things more which are declared in the Palsey.
Conuulsion of the mouth through the Palsey. §. 14. THis disease is thus described of the Phisitions: Contorsio is a disease which alte∣reth the naturall shape of the face: or, Contorsio is a conuulsion of the mouth and lips to the right or left side; so that it doth otherwhiles cleare shut vp one eye, and also the breath issueth out but at one corner of the mouth, whereby some∣times also the whole face is changed in colour. In fine, it is a Crampe, with a contraction and shortening of the sinewes, which draweth the lips hither or thitherwards, and these be the most causes, (like as in the Crampe and Palsey hath bene shewed) that if it procéede of moysture, then it is a kind of Pal∣sey: whensoeuer it is caused through drith, then it is a kind of Crampe. Also this contorsion or contraction commeth sometimes by reason of an impostume, like as in the paine of the throte, which quickly strangleth a bodie. This Crampe or contraction of the mouth assaileth a bodie oftentimes sodainly, as in Phre∣nitide and such like, whereof at this present shall not be spoken, because that the same is com∣monly a signe of death: it commeth also not through repletion of the bodie, but through inani∣tion and drith. But we speake here onely of that which is caused of Spasmus or the Crampe, which distendeth the sinewes from houre to houre, therfore is there some aduice to be done and taken for it. But for to expell this disease there is somewhat to be done vnto it out of hand, that there bréede not a worse matter of it, as Epilepsia, or Apoplexia. This cure is first to be begun with Cli∣sters, especially if the patient be bound, and to acuate the Clisters by little and little. Afterwards he is to be let bloud, if it be not that this accident be so small, that there were time sufficient first to take a purgation, and to take good héede whether the vrine be cleare and well coloured, and then to open the Saluatella, besides the little finger vpon the right hand, and to let out thrée or foure ounces of bloud, and after that to purge. These preparatiue potions is he to take first of all: take Calmus sixe ounces, Ginger and Nutmegs of each one ounce, clarified Honie nine ounces, make a cleare sirupe thereof, and giue the sicke person thereof certaine dayes together euery morning two or thrée ounces tempered with the decoction of Sage. Afterwards he is to take these Pils: take Pill. Cochiae, de Sarcocolla, de Hermodactylis, of each one scrup. and Dysagridion two graines, make thereof 7. pils, with the iuice of Rue, and take them early in the morning fasting, and fast sixe houres vpon it: for this vse are also good the pils Foetidae. Will you then haue them more forcible? then take two drag. of the pils Cochiae, prepa∣red Coloquint, and Bdellium, of each one drag. make pils thereof as big as a pease, and if the patient be reasonable strong, then giue him a drag. at once. Item, let his head be shauen and rubbed softly with warme clothes, vntill the skinne begin to be red, and then annoint it with this following: take the iuice of Swines bred thrée ounces, Stechados, Penniroyall, Mints, Hyssop, of each one ounce beaten, and one quarter of an ounce of Violets, temper them all together. When he hath then purged well, and the matter is prepared, which is done in foure daies, then is he to vse euery day before meate this Gargarisme. Take white Mustard séede two ounces, Vineger one ounce and a halfe, Hony thrée ounces, séeth them all together in a pint of water vnto the halfe, and skimme it well. But it is here to be noted, that these Gargarismes must not be vsed at the first, that they make not an affluxe of the humors, and the accident thereby be augmented. Item, take Nutmegs, Pieretrum, Stechados, of each halfe an ounce, séeth them and vse them as before. You may also temper amongst it Oxymel of Squils. Another. Take thrée ounces of Calmus, Vineger one ounce, and vse it as before. This contraction of the mouth sometimes also yeeldeth much spettle, and to further the same and to make it runne the better, make this Masticatorie. Take Licebane, Mastick, white Mustard séede, Pieretrum, of each a like quantitie, temper it with molten virgin waxe, make small balles or pellets of it as big as Hasell nuts. This is to be chewed & spit out: the same doth frankinsence & Mastick also together, or each chewed by it self.
Neesing. NEesing is very good: wherewith it might be effected, you are to séeke for that in the first Register. Salues. ALso the nape and hinder part of the head, the throate, the face, and the forehead are to be annointed with the oile of Costus: but it were good, that one made first a Cypers boord hot, and bound it in a cloth, and laid it so long on the neck and shoulders, vntill the same parts were throughly warmed, and afterwards annointed. Item take the oile of Costus one ounce and a halfe, oyle of Euphorbium half an ounce, Mints, the séede of Rue, Stechas, Penniroyall, Lignum Aloes, of each halfe a drag. oyle of Beuercod one ounce, white Waxe as much as is néedfull; besprinkle it with some Vineger of Squils, and therewith annoint all the necke from the nape to the rumpe foure times in 24. houres. Item take Calmus foure ounces and a halfe, Ginger, Nutmegs, of each thrée drag. oyle of Costus foure ounces, wine as much as is néedfull: let them séeth together by a mild fire vntill the wine be consumed, straine it, and make a salue thereof with molten waxe. A Plaister. TAke Betonie sixe ounces, white water Mints, field Mints, Penniroyall, Marioram, of each one ounce and a halfe (altogether greene,) Stechas two ounces, Pease meale one ounce and a halfe, Beane meale two ounces, Saffron halfe a drag. séeth these herbes in sharpe lye vnto grout; afterwards temper the meale and Saffron vnto it, also oile of Beuercod, oile of Pepper, and of Rue, of each two ounces: lay it morning and euening warme vpon the head, and vpon the temples of the head, where this contorsion is. Another. TAke Opopanacum thrée ounces, Calmus thrée drag. Ginger, Nutmegs, of each one dragme, Turpentine one quarter of an ounce, melt the Gum and Turpentine, and temper it with the rest vnto a plaister; then spread it vpon a cloth, and lay it behind vpon the head, vpon the necke, and ouer all the nape. Item, Take fresh Swines bread halfe an ounce, Marioram gentle seuen drag. Lignum Aloes, one drag. and a halfe, séeth them in a pint of water vnto the halfe: but before that the patient draweth vp this into his nose, he must first take his mouth full of hony, or sugred water, and then hold some of the said decoction in his hand, and draw of it thrée times through the right nostrill, and thrice also thorow the left nostrill, and that one hower before supper: the like also in the morning and at noone. This is very requisite for health: he is also euery day two or thrée howers before supper to swallow downe two or thrée cornes of Myrrhe. A capitall Powder. TAke Stechas, Penniroyall, white water Mints, and Betonie, of each one drag. and a half, Pieretrum, Costus rootes, Licebane, of each one drag. Marioram gentle, powne it, and tem∣per it all together: Strew therewith the vppermost part of the head, rubbing it gently. Also it is to be strewed thereon, when he hath annointed him with the oile of Costus. A Lotion for the feete. IT is also very good to vse these Lotions for the féet before meate, wherein Woodbind is sod∣den. Also the féete, the legs, the thighes, the hands, the armes and face may be washed with this decoction following: Take Bay leaues two handfuls, Iuniper leaues thrée handfuls: séeth them all together in a good deale of water, vntill it smell swéete.
Order of Diet. THis patient is to kéepe himselfe from eating and drinking; and all other things, as is taught in the Palsey, and Apoplexie: viz. to eschew wine, to drinke honie water, to eate Kids, or young Goates, Roebucks, and Hares, rather rosted then boyled. All his other meates are to be besprinkled with Rosemarie, Sage, Wormwood, white wa∣ter Mints, garden Mints Penniroyall, and Comin. And albeit that hot spices are also good for him, yet may he in stead thereof vse these following. Take Nutmegs one ounce, long Pepper, Beuercod, Galingall, of each one scrup. Seduarie halfe a drag. powne all small and temper them together. Item take Nutmegs, Ginger, of each thrée drag. of the confection of Calmus thrée ounces, Sugar as much as will suffice to make an electuarie: this ought he to vse in the morning fasting. Egges howsoeuer they be drest, Rice, Colewoorts, and Rapes he may eate. But from milke, and all that is drest with it, from all fruit, and all that is of cold a & moist nature must he refrain. A darke habitation is also méete for him, and to looke oftentimes into a looking glasse, and to force himselfe to set his mouth right: great labour also is not fit for him, but rather rest and moderate sléepe. To warme him, he is to burne that wood which is warme of nature, as Firre wood, and Iuniper wood: he is alwaies to kéepe his head couered with a Foxe furre, and to hold alwaies a péece of Nutmegge in the mouth, in the place affected, or in stead of that these Trociscos: Take Calmus two ounces and a quarter, Ginger halfe an ounce, Nutmegs two drag. and a halfe, powne them all together, and stéepe them two daies in water of Sage. Now if it be too moist, then let it drie away vpon warme ashes, and then with hony make Trociscos of it, of the weight of a drag. and a halfe, and hold them in the mouth: if you can swallow them, they will do no hurt. And if these things will not helpe, then must he purge againe, and lastly make an issue be∣hind in the nape of the necke, and on the veines vnder the eare, or vnder the chin with an hote iron or corrosiue, and to hold it long enough open. Of the Crampe, and conuulsion of the sinewes by the Palsey. §. 15. THis disease is also a kind of Paralysis, called of the Grecians Spasmus, and by the Latinists Conuulsio, and it hath also no small agréement with the foresaid contra∣ction or contorsion of the mouth, (like as hath bene said already:) in like manner also with the Epilepsia, and all other diseases which be reckoned amongst such like infections, and it is described thus: Spasmus or Conuulsio, is a contraction of the sinewes and muscles against our wils, which sometimes do conuulse but one part, and otherwhiles the whole bodie. The Grecians for diuers causes, do giue this Crampe, sundrie names, Opisthotonos, that is, when the sinewes are drawne backwards; Emphrosthotonos, when they be drawne forwards; Tetanos, when one member waxeth stiffe like to a sticke. The causes of these are otherwhiles when any one is thrust into a sinew, wounded or ouerburde∣ned with too much labor or work. Also it is caused through great scowring of the body, through excessiue bléeding, through vnbridled lecherie, fright and wormes, &c. In fine, the causes do procéed of an intemperate nature, as cold which is augmented, and heate which is diminished: also of drith and moisture, according to that the body is full or emptie. Of these differences there be yet more, which are here too long to be rehearsed. Neuerthelesse, yet can I not omit, that this Spasmus (of whatsoeuer cause that it do procéed, and especially if it be caused of a hot Ague) is not only a bad signe, but also that it is incurable: for by reason of the heate the sinewes will be a great deale too drie, and shrunke vp short, like as one for example may sée by a leather lace, or such like, if one hold it by the fire, then will it be hard and shrinketh. On the contrarie, if it be holden in a moist place, it will be lithier or limber. When as then such kind of Crampes do assayle the whole bodie, and that the patient begin∣neth to be childish, and addicted much to sléepe, then is the disease in the marrow of the backe∣bone, which hath his ofspring from the braine. Also this disease commeth either sodainely, or
slowly: that which commeth sodainly, procéedeth of repletion of the body, and is through pur∣ging (as hath bene said of the Palsey) to be remedied. But it must be more and oftener annointed and rubbed with the oyle of Costus, for that the humor is much grosser than in the Palsey, and may worse be consumed. But if so be that this sicknesse be by little and little bred and growne, then is the cure to be taken in hand after ano∣ther manner, viz. at the first to vse preparatiues, and afterwards digestiues are to be vsed, as followeth hereafter. The rubbing of the lims downward is very méete, for that it disperseth and digesteth the moisture, and openeth the pores: afterwards are these salues or oyles following to be vsed: to lay plaisters vpon it, to couer the limmes with Foxe, Wolues, or Cats furre, and to kéep them warme: or if so be that one member alone be conuulsed, it is to be wrapt about with warme clothes. Suppling or mollifying Salue. TAke the Muscilage of Fenegréeke, and of Linséede, of each halfe an ounce, fresh butter and sewet, of each two ounces, and a little waxe, and make a salue thereof. Digestiue Salue. THis Salue is described before in the 13. §. viz. where it beginneth: Take Calmus, Lilly rootes, &c. Of these two salues the patient is to vse at the first the mollifying oyntment the first two daies, and afterwards the other so long also, and so forth, now the one, and then the other, vntill that the matter begin to auoid. Item, take a fat young Cat, plucke off the skinne, and take out the intrailes, chop her small, and fill therewith a Goose, let her rost softly, gather the drippings, and preserue it well, for it is also good for the palsey through cold. You haue before in the 13. §. one salue almost like vnto this, and also one other salue more in the said discourse where it beginneth thus: Take Beuer∣cod, &c. Take Euphorbium, Cinnamome, Saffron, Frankinsence, Beuercod, Pith, Opopanacum, the iuice of wild Rue, and drie Hyssope, of each halfe an ounce, Waxe one ounce and a halfe, Piere∣trum, Ammoniacum, of each halfe a drag. Sallad oyle as much as is néedfull for to make a salue, therewith are you to annoint the whole bodie. Take oyle of sweet Almonds sixe ounces, beaten Saffron one drag. and a halfe, good wine euict 12. ounces, séeth them all together in a tinne pan on a mild fire, vntill the wine be consu∣med, and annoint therewith the cramped limmes, this is a noble remedie. Many kinds of sewets or fats are very requisite for this, for to make salues thereof, viz. of Lions, Beares, Badgers, Hens, Goates, Capons, and such like, as shall be hereafter discoursed in the fift part, where we shall speake of the lame and extenuated members. There are many more common plaisters and salues good for this, which are to be found rea∣die at all Apothecaries, as followeth hereafter. Ceratum de Hyssopo, Ʋnguentum Arragon, Mar∣tiaton, Emplastrum de Meliloto, Diachilon, Oxycroceum dissolued with the oyle of Lillies, oyle of Tyles, oyle of Foxes, of Beuercod, of Rue, and of blew Floure de luce, and all other which be warme of nature. Of the things which are to be taken inwardly, Treacle, Mithridate, confected rootes of Eringus, and also Wormwood wine are very good. Of Bathing. ALl Bathes which be by nature Allomie, or Sulphurish, or made artificially, are much commended. Also one may prepare a bath in this manner: take wild and tame Rue, Iuniper tops, Wormewood, Sothernwood, Penniroyall, Bay leaues, Cypers rootes, Dragon bloud, Squinant, of each one M. séethe them all together in sufficient water for to bath therein, put the patient into it, and afterwards lay him in a bed, that he may sweate. In like manner is méete for this a drie bath; but one must not abide in it long, for auoyding of swo∣ning: you may also vse the bath which is discouered before in the 13. §. Also gargarismes and néesings.
Of the Crampe through emptinesse and heate. IF this contagion assaile one not suddenly, but by little and little, as after an Ague, through great scowring, vomiting, or through much bléeding, then it is very hard, and almost incu∣rable, by reason that it is caused through emptinesse, to wit, of Exinanitione, neuertheles neces∣sarie meanes are not to be omitted. First, Barly water is good for this patient, especially if there be Crabbes or prepared wood-Snailes decocted therewith, for that this drinke will almost wholly and throughly turne to nourishment. Secondly, he may drinke well watered Wine, reare egs, and Henbroth prepared as here∣after followeth: Take a Hen, chop her small, and put her in a Can, powre Rosewater vpon it, and Wine, of each a good spoonefull, stop it tight that there can come no vapour out, and so put the Can into a Kettle of séething water, and take cleane away the fatnesse. But if the patient be very weak, thē take a Capon and rost him a little, afterwards drip it with vnsalted Lard,A comforta∣ble broth. beate him and presse out hard the iuice, temper it amongst the foresaid Henbroth, then will the same be the stronger. A better Broth. LAy a drest Capon in wine, powned and distilled in a glassed helme; that water strengthe∣neth much in extreme debilitie: temper also amongst it the yolke of an egge. Item, chop a Pullet, hang the péeces on thréeds in a great glasse or pot, stop it tight, and seethe it thrée howers long in a Kettle of water, and vse the liquor that hath dropped out of it. If you will make it more cordiall, then lay therein ten or twelue péeces of gold. For this is also milk méete; first womans milke: secondly, Asses milke: thirdly, Goates milke, as new as you can get it. If so be that there come a scowring with it, then steele the milke with stéele or flint stones. The meate which he is to vse and take whēsoeuer there is an ague with it, ought to be Kids, Lambes, and Hens, wherein Spinage, Mallowes, Béetes, Purslaine, Lettice, or such be de∣cocted. Watered wine is also permitted, if there be no heate perceiued. For Strengthening. TAke Pullets or Kids flesh which is méetely sodden seuen ounces, chop it small; temper amongst it Cardamome, Cloues, Cucubes, Galingall, Ginger, Nutmegs, Dragagant, and Gum, of each one drag. Mace, Saffron, of each two scrup. Starch. Licorice, Currants, pilled Almonds, Pine apple kernels, Sebestes, Pistacies, pilled Melon séede, Pompeon seede, Gourds, and Cucumber seedes, white Poppie seede, Lettice seede, and Purslaine seede, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar pennets foure ounces; dissolue it in Buglosse water, with other Sugar as much as is needfull for to make a confection thereof. Of Bathing. FOr this disease is also commaunded for to bath in luke warme water. But to the end it might be the more forcible, cooling hearbes may be decocted therein; as water Lillies, Vio∣let leaues and Willow leaues. For this purpose also, bathing in milke is much commen∣ded. Item, at last shall the beginning of the sinewes be annointed with warme oyle of Violets, oyle of Pompeons, and such like, thereby to stay the exsiccation of them. This salue following is also maruellous good: Take Hens and Ducks grease, and the mar∣row of Calues bones, of each halfe an ounce, the muscilage of Fleawoort, Dragagant, and Gum, of each three drag. oyle of water Lillies, and Willowes, of each one ounce and a halfe, Waxe as much as is needfull for a salue, annoint therewith all the backe bone. It is also good for all other members. Crampe through wounding. BVt if this Crampe or contraction of the sinewes do come through any wounds then are the oiles of Cammomill, Dill, and Flaxe tempered together, or each alone requisite & fit for it.
Item take wine lées, temper some beaten Allume amongst it: this is of a maruellous force and operation. Take Linseede, and Fenegréeke meale, powned Dill séede, Henbane rootes, and Annis séedes, of each a like quantitie: temper them with the foresayd oyle, and lay it warme vpon it. Here be also two experiments which euery one may proue: Take Victorialis longa, other∣wise called Allium Alpium, and weare it alwayes hanging about the necke: it should defend a body from the crampe. The second: Plucke off an Eeles skin, and let it be dressed like leather; when you be plagued with the crampe, then lay it vpon it; and when the skin is warme, then ceaseth the paine. Of the hag or mare Ephialte, and Incubus. § 16. ALthough that we haue reckoned among the fiue species of the palsie or Apoplexy, the falling sicknesse Epilepsia to be the fourth; yet doth method first of all require, to write of this sicknesse, the which through vnbeléefe is with vs called the hag or mare, bicause that this Incubus is a messenger of a future falling sicknesse. The vnbeléeuers make thereof Daemonium insultans, which is an vpstarting and pinching Deuill, the which we also in this country, as is sayd, make one another to beléeue, that they be witches. But in truth it is none other but a naturall sicknesse, as hereafter shall more euidently appeare. The Incubus is thus described: Incubus is a sicknesse which vexeth the body, whereby both motion and speach is taken away. Or more larger; Ephialtes is a sicknesse, when a body is in his first sléepe, lying on his backe, doth suppose and also beléeue none other, but that somewhat crée∣peth vpwards from his féete vnto the brest, the which wringeth, & vexeth him there as it were a ghost, & so wholy hindreth his breath & voyce, that he cannot call for any helpe, yea it séemeth that it would murder him: therefore is otherwhiles heard of them, that be vexed therewith, such a kinde of groning, that as soone as the vexation or torment is past, they awake with great feare and trembling. And albeit that this disease of it selfe alone is troublesome inough, neuerthelesse somewhat else is to be feared thereby, viz. the conuulsion or madnesse which is Mania, and (like as it is already sayd) the falling sicknesse Epilepsia, and especially of them which haue great head veines; bicause that the braines (as the place of the vnderstanding) are thereby enféebled. Now when as such accidents come, then is there no long delay to be looked for: therefore it is méete indéed that there be aduice taken for it out of hand, & first of all to take good héed, whe∣ther the sicke person haue a good colour. And if so be that also his veines be full, then is the Sa∣phaea to be opened; secondly (if néede require) the Cephalaea; thirdly, the veine of the forehead, or vnder the tong. And if great heate of the time, or any thing else do hinder it, then set thereon two boxing cups with picking, the one vpon the right brawne of the leg towards the héele, the other hard by the ham: but if it amend not thereby, then set two vpon the shoulders. Also it is very néedefull to obserue good order in eating and drinking, and to refraine from wine, swéete things, and especially of all that engendreth bloud. Some allow wine, yet that which is thin, white, cleare, and well watered, drunken soberly. For his meate are all fowles good which haue abode in hillie countries, better than any foure footed beasts: yet of these, the wild are alwayes better than the tame. Item new layd egs sodden reare, Capers, with Oxymel are good for him in the beginning of supper; he is to eschew fish, and especially sodden fish: he is to shun all fruit, except Raisons, Pingles, Pistacies, confected Peares, Quinces, and such like. All herbes be also forbidden him, except Fennell, Dill, and Buglosse: but Rue, Sage, Mar∣ierom gentle, Hyssope, and Rosemarie are especial good for him, which are rather to be reckened for medicine than for nourishment. Furthermore, he is to refraine these things, as the Sunne, cold winds, the fire, the smoke, incontinencie, bathing, wearinesse, care, much vexation, déepe speculation, and especially two howers after meate, all great noise, to looke from any height, to looke vpon whirling things, or that turne suddenly about, and all that shineth much, all strong sauors, long sléepe, especially after noone, much watching, and such like: but méetely mouing after dinner is very good. Also
he must be rubbed otherwhiles from the shoulders to the brest, vntill beneath vpon the legs, with warme clothes. And when that is done, then is the head to be kemmed and wel rubbed. Piony rootes worne about the necke, and smelling oftentimes vnto them, are also very good. 15. Piony kernels pée∣led and drunken in honied water, do much hinder and let that the vapors which might obstruct the braines, should not ascend vpwards, and do also strengthen the braines. Confected Mirobalani Chebuli taken euery morning doth strengthen the head & the braines, and driue away the mare. If the sicke body looke bleake in the face, then it is a signe of Melan∣cholie. Therefore is he to vse the pils Cochiae oftentimes, to the end he may be well purged. Fur∣ther, he is no otherwise to order himselfe in eating and drinking, than as is shewed in Epilepsi; for that Incubus is none other than a small falling sicknesse, or Epilepsia. This water following is very good for to purge: Take Hyssope two handfuls, Currans one ounce, seeth this togither in a pint and a halfe of raine water vnto the halfe, take thereof three ounces, of Oxymel of Squils one ounce and a halfe, drinke it euery morning continuing the space of eight or ten dayes, méetely warme. When the body is purged, then is the head also to be purged with this gargarisme ensuing: Take Hyssope, Currans, and Oxymel sodden togither with water, & gargarise therewith. Née∣sing is also behoouefull, like as hath many times béene expressed. In like manner may you carrie these little bals or pellets in the mouth. Take Penniroyall one ounce, seuen fresh Figs, long Pepper one dragme, Pieretrum halfe a dragme, powne them all togither, and make pellets or round bals of it. It is also maruellous good twise a wéeke in the euening and morning to take a halfe a dragme of Treacle or Mithridate, with thrée ounces of water wherein Piony rootes are decocted. If this disease be caused through great cold of the head, then it is to be annointed with the oile of Costus, of Rue, or oile of Bay: But if it be caused through ouercharging of the stomacke, then it is to be holpen with vomiting, clisters, and such like. For this is also to be sought to strengthen the hart and the braines, which is very conueni∣ently done with this confection following. Take red Corall, Harts bones, Pearles, and burnt Silke, of each halfe a dragme, Galingale, Cardamome, Graines, long Pepper, Cloues, Nutmegs, cleansed Mirtle, and Piony kernels, of each one ounce and a halfe, Cinnamom one ounce, Mace, Saffron, of each one dragme, white Sugar thirtie foure ounces, séeth it vnto a sirupe in Buglosse water, and make an Electuarie of it. In the winter hony is to be vsed in stead of Sugar, whereof you are to take in the euening and morning the quantitie of a great nut, and thereupon to drinke a draught of water where∣in Piony rootes are decocted. The confection of Diathamaron and Diambrae are also very méete for this purpose. For a conclusion, if so be that these foresaid remedies brought not health with them, then are they once againe to be vsed. At the last cast or néede, there must be plaisters layd vpon the head, that corrode the flesh and skin on the forehead, wherin the scul is ioyned togither, which is to be made with Mustard séed or Cantharides, as is taught in this Chapter in the second §. and in other places, or to open it by an actuall cauterie. Of the falling sicknesse, called Epilepsia. §. 17. WE name this sicknesse with sundry names. And albeit that it be but one kind of sicknesse: notwithstanding it séemeth by diuersitie of the names to haue some smal difference. The Grecians do call it Epilepsia, the Latinists Morbus Comitia∣lis, Caducus, Herculeus, and Lunaticus: the which we haue comprehended all vn∣der foure kinds of Apoplexies, and taught also therby, that this falling sicknes (as also all other) is an infection of the braine. This is a quicke and spéedy distraction of the vnderstanding, whereby the partie is so spoy∣led and robbed of all his wits, powers, remembrance, and all the vse of his members, that he must suddenly and vnawares fall downe to the earth, some, and lye a certaine space without motion, séeth not, heareth not, neither féeleth, and somtimes, also doth forcibly stir and cast him
selfe about; when he commeth to himselfe againe, he knoweth nothing of it, what is happened vnto him, although there be some that know all that was done with or about them. The causes of this sicknesse are diuers, for that it proceedeth of the foure humors of the bo∣die, and doth chiefly take his beginning of Phlegma, next of Melancholia, sometime of the bloud, and seldome of Cholera. This is also increased by excessiue eating, drunkennesse, all sauors of meates; and of all things which fume vp into the head, as Onions, Garlicke, raw fruites, and such like, that be of a cold and moyst nature, wormes of the belly, whereof the venimous va∣pors ascend vpwards out of the stomacke towards the head, putrifaction of the detained natu∣rall seede, of obstructed termes in women, like as oftentimes also happeneth to women which haue first conceiued, to sit long in the Sunne with a full stomacke, to eate or smell to Bucks li∣uers. Also thunder and lightening do hurt them, whereby they are wont quickly to fall, as also long and much sleepe, and all that increaseth Phlegma. There hurteth them also, who are infected with this sicknesse, the South wind, cold & moist countries, and the smell of these fiue things following, as Goates hornes, which is so forcible, that they that suppose to be cleane rid of this sicknesse, receiuing the sewet therof, must immedi∣atly fall to the ground. Item Galbanum, Myrrha, Benzuin, and aboue all the herbe Smallage, like as it is found, that it hath caused one to fall only through looking vpon it, therfore such persons must and are to be kept from them. Youth is also more subiect to this disease than age: but it is easier to be cured in young persons than in old, like as shall be more at large taught hereafter. The signes of one that hath the falling sicknesse, are these: if he fall suddenly to the earth, bendeth him, beateth or striketh from him, loseth his vnderstanding, and tometh at the mouth, if thereby his vrine, nature, or excrements passe away; then it is a signe, that the sicknesse is the stronger. Order of Diet. IT importeth as well young as old people in this sicknesse, like as in all other sicknesses, but for this sicknesse must regard be had, especially of the age and youth, nature, custome, and abilitie of the patient. In common falling sicknesses is first to be eschewed all cold moist and watrie places, in like sort also all meates cold of nature, all that bringeth with it slime, and obstructions, as Dow, Milke, Fish, Gourds, Lettice, Béetes, Spinage, Pur∣slaine, Cucumbers, and fat flesh. Item all strong things, as Onions, Garlicke, Scallions, Ra∣dishes, Coleworts, Mustard séede, all that is much salted, and all Spices. Item, fresh water, all strong wine, be it red or white, and chiefly sweete, they are very hurtfull: like as is also to eate too much, and to swallow downe meate vnchewed, and to eate againe before the former be digested, long sléepe, and principally to sléepe by day, he is vtterly to eschew. But on the contrarie, all his meates are to be drying, as Mutton, Partridges, Pheasants, all wood Fowles, with some Pepper, Zeduarie, and Galingall prepared, and alwaies rather rosted then sodden: his drinke must be thin, cleare, small red wine; but if the wine be somwhat strong, then it is to be tempered with the water of Buglosse, or the water wherein Betonie rootes are decocted. Great motion is not fit for him, but rather much rest. The remedies which are to be vsed for this falling sicknesse are most of them here before (where we haue discoursed of the hag or mare) described, which according to the importance of the cause must be vsed for old folkes, which be burthened and troubled with this disease. And because (like as before is discouered) the young children by reason of their moisture, whereof they be full, are more subiect to this sicknesse; therefore we will first (as much as shall concerne that) describe these meanes, and remedies following. Of the Falling sicknesse in children. VVIth sucking children nothing is safer to be taken, than that the mother or nurse doe obserue a good order of diet, eate meate that is light of digestion, and that moderate∣ly warmeth, that she refraine man, and all that maketh grosse bloud. And if she be conceiued, then is the child to sucke no more at any hand: before meate she is to moue and stir
well, and to drinke watred wine or small Béere: she is to refraine and leaue all fruits, and espe∣cially those that be cold and moist. In fine, she is not to gouerne her selfe otherwise than if she were her selfe infected with the falling sicknesse. When as the child doth waxe stronger, and beginneth to féede on other meate, then it is to be gouerned according to the importance of his age, and of his sicknes, like as by this prescription (and other Chapters written to this end) may be seene. These are alwaies the remedies which by the auncient Phisitions be commended for young childrens falling sicknesse, and are found profitable. Take water of Rue, May Lillies, of each a like quantitie; giue a spoonefull thereof or more, according to the bignesse of the child, make péeces of Tiles hote, lay chopt Rue theron sprinkled with vineger, hold him that before his nose: the same is also good for ancient people. Temper Conserue of Violets in Endiue water, or Pyony water; this is very good if there be any heate mixt amongst it. Make thicke Almond milke, temper therein as much Sugar that it be as thicke as pappe, wipe thereof in the childs mouth, it nourisheth well, bringeth sléepe with it, and defendeth the stomacke from all foule stinking humors: the water of Chickwéeke is also very requisite for this. Others do commend much for this, the water of Cowdung: and if it cannot be had, then is the Cowdung to be broken into faire water, and strained through a cloth, and to giue thereof halfe an ounce at least. Item, take the water of blacke Cherries, water of Tillet blossomes, of each a like quantitie: giue it in the time of sicknesse, or when it is thought to be at hand. The fish that is called Mustella Fluutatilis, or Trinca, called Trisca in Latine, hath two small bones lying vpon the braines, which are to be dried and powdred, and giuen to the child. These are maruellous good: but these small bones are to be taken out of an vnsodden fish, for when they be sodden they haue lost their vertue. It hapneth also, that children when they be full of wormes do get the falling sicknes, which is very dangerous: against which you shall find hereafter in the third part, where we shall dis∣course of the wormes, sundrie good aduises. Take young Magpies out of the nest, distill water of them, and giue to young children a spoonefull for the Falling sicknesse. Another. Take three young Magpies that cannot flie, Vngula Alcis, thrée drag. Harts horne shauen one drag. and a halfe, distill them together, and vse them as before: it hath bene often prooued. Item, take Carduus Benedictus water two ounces, Lauander water halfe an ounce, when you perceiue that the falling sicknesse will assaile any bodie, whether they be young or old, then looke that you get a young hare, which sucketh still, take the maw out of it, (hang it in the aire that the milke may drie in it) wherof giue to the sicke person one drag. or lesse (according to the importance) powdred with fresh water: for this are Pyony kernels good, worne about the neck, and also the powder thereof taken, the roote sodden, and dronken thereof, and the powder strew∣ed vpon the meate, is also very good. A good Powder. TAke prepared Pearles one drag. red Corall halfe a drag. Miscleden one drag. and a halfe, prepared Amber two scrup. Harts bones one drag. Pyonie séede, and the rootes, of each halfe a drag. white Sugar one ounce, beaten gold sixe leaues: of this powder is euery wéeke one drag. to be giuen with Betonie water: Sometime also halfe a dragme or a dragme tempered with a little broth. A Powder. TAke halfe a drag. of the scull of an executed man, prepared Pearles one drag. Harts horne two scrup. Tormentill, Seduarie, of each two scrup. Sugar candie one ounce and a halfe, fiue leaues of beaten gold; temper them all together, and giue it to the sicke body with Pyonie water and such like.
A Confection. FEtch these things following at the Apothecaries: take Diapenidium at the Apothecaries thrée drag. Pliris Arcoticon, one drag. Diambra halfe a drag. Cinnamome one drag. and a halfe, Nutmegs, Cucubes, of each two scrup. Ginger one drag. Sugar eight ounces, melt them in Pionie water, and make a Confection thereof. All that is before written of yong children, is also to be vsed for aged people, taking alwaies good héede, whether the sicknesse be great or small, and also with that which followeth hereafter. Yet more of the Falling sicknesse. BVt if so be that the Falling sicknesse doth assaile young, full growne, or auncient people, then (besides all that is already discouered) this is one common and necessarie rule, that euery one which is infected with this sicknesse, kéepe himselfe at home in rainie weather, in places which be warmed with fuming workes and fire, and be also drie. The chamber is to be strewed with herbes, which are necessarie for the falling Euill as Rue, wild Time, Rosema∣rie, of each halfe a M. powne them, and make them in a bagge thrée quarters long, at night lay it on both sides vnder the head. If there be then any one infected with this sicknesse, that perceiueth something to ascend or clime vp out of any member of the bodie towards the head, then must he, as soone as is possible, and before that he falleth or goeth beside himself, bind hard the place where he féeleth it créeping vpwards, wring hard the fingers and rub the féete, set boxing cups behind on the neck, without picking, thereby to suppresse the ascending vapors, and afterwards (if it may be possible) for to set or minister vnto him this Clister following. Take Swines bread, black Hellebore, Centorie, fresh white Daffodill, of each one drag. wild Saffron séede halfe an ounce, seeth this in a quart of water vntill the halfe. Take 13. ounces of this decoction, temper therein Hiera logodion, one ounce, oyle of Euphorbium 10. drag. Salgemme one drag. and a halfe, temper all these together, it is a very strong Clister for to draw the matter out of the head. Set also great boxing cups on the inside of the thighes, besides the buttockes, and rub well his armes and legs downward. Take the iuice of Swines bread, the séede of Rue, the Rennet of Hares mawes, of each one quarter of an ounce, stirre them together in a mortar, blow that into his nose through a Vul∣tures quill: there haue bene before times maruels wrought thereby. There is also a great noyse to be made about the patient, to open his eyes, and hold great light before them: when he is come to rest againe, then is he to purge often with these pils Co∣chiae (or some other) but vsing alwaies before certaine Iuleps, thereby the more easily to take away the humor. Whilest that he vseth these potions, he must presently vpon it, likewise also two howers before meate, take and vse the quantitie of a Nutmeg of this conserue following. Take Pistacies shaled, which haue bene stéeped one night in Pionie water thrée ounces, Doronicum, Harts bones, Burrage, and Buglosse flowers, Violets, Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, red and white Behen, of each one drag. and a halfe, Basill, red Corall, of each two drag. and a halfe, Iacint, Smaragda, Saphir, of each one scrup. Graines, Lignum Aloes, of each two scrup. water Lillies, and Yuorie, of each foure scrup. fiue leaues of beaten gold, Muscu, Ambra, of each fiue graines, Honie of Roses, sirupe of Citron peeles, of each fiue ounces, Sugar thrée ounces: you are to séeth the sirupe and Sugar in foure ounces of Buglosse water vntill the water be cleane consumed: breake the Muske and Amber in a litle Lauander water, and temper all the rest amongst it. This may be also vsed whensoeuer he vseth not the other pot∣ons, and so forth now the one, and then the other. It is also aduised to couer the place whence the disease is caused with plaisters, which make blisters, and to let them lie so long vpon it, vntill the blisters be drawne full of water, and break of themselues, and runne out; the which are not to be suffered to shut in ten daies; to the end the moisture haue his full course, for this is one of the most principall remedies that is méete for this maladie.
Plaisters which raise and draw blisters. TAke Mustard séede, Pepper, and Euphorbium beaten small, of each one drag. Honie of Ana∣cardio, as much as is néedfull for a plaister: spread this vpon a cloth the bignes of a Doller, and lay it on the place where you desire. But this ensuing is generally vsed: Take Cantharides (heads and wings broken off) one quarter of an ounce, Honie of Anacardio, and sowre dowe, of each one drag. strong vineger as much as is néedfull for to temper it together: lay this vpon it as is said, when the blister is full, open it with a needle with a thréed in it, and leaue the thréed behind, that thereby the humidity may be let out. Item, take blacke Sope, quicke Lime, of each one quarter of an ounce, mixe them together. A Stronger. TAke Cantharides prepared as before, quicke Lime, of each a like quantitie, temper them with the iuice of Daffodils, some do burne it with iron or gold. When as these blisters haue run enough, they are to be healed with this salue: Take Aristo∣logie, Ireos, Myrrhe, Frankinsence, Sarcocolla, of each one drag. oile of Roses foure ounces, Waxe as much as is néedfull; make a salue thereof. For this also is aduised to set boxing cups with small picking vpon the same place: And if the patient, before the sicknes assailed him, were grieued with any kind of vomiting, with griping and panting of the heart, and came thereby to fall: then is the vomiting or casting to be furthered by all manner of meanes. Take blew flower de-luce rootes one ounce, Aristologie halfe an ounce, Centorie, garden Mints, Wormwood, Rue, Sage, Hyssope, Polypodie, Mallowes, Mercurie, of each a M. Sil∣uer mountaine, Ameos, Dill séede, wild Rape seede, and Basill séede, of each one quarter of an ounce, beaten Pionie seede, and a little Bran: séeth these all together in a good deale of water: of this decoction you are to take 14. ounces, temper therein one ounce and an halfe of Honie, salt one quarter of an ounce, Hiera Picra, three quarters of an ounce, oyle of Rue two ounces, make a Clister thereof. For to Purge. HAlfe an ounce or one ounce of Hiera Picra taken oftentimes, is very conuenient. But it is better to vse first some preparatiue potions, which are thus to be composed. Take blew flower de luce roots, or Ireos, Pyonie roots, Fennell rootes, and Aristologie, of each one ounce and a halfe, prepared Squils one ounce, garden Mints, and Wormwood, of each one handfull and a halfe, wild Thyme, Miscleden, wild and tame Sage, and Rue, of each one M. Annise, Fennell séede, Pyonie seedes pilled, of each one ounce; Siluer mountaine, Basl séede, of each halfe an ounce; Licorice, Raisins, and Stechas, of each one ounce, the iuice of Fu∣mitorie (or the water) two ounces, clarified honie sixe ounces, Sugar nine ounces: seeth the herbes, séedes, and roots all together; afterwards wring it out hard, and with the decoction, the Honie and Sugar make a cleare sirupe: giue thereof to the patient the space of certaine dayes together one ounce and a halfe, or two ounces, with any of the waters méete for it. And because that the foresaid Hiera is gentle in purging, and this sicknesse doth require strong things; ther∣fore take Hiera Picra two drag. and a halfe, prepared Coloquint, and Bdellium, of each halfe a scrup. Masticke thrée graines, make pils thereof with the iuice of Wormwood, and giue the pa∣tient one drag. at night going to bed. In like sort when he goeth to bed, then is this salue following, the quantity of a Hemp séed, to be wiped at the least thrice a wéeke in the patients nose: Take Oxe gall one quarter of an ounce, Starch halfe a drag. Nigella séed halfe a scrup. Marioram gentle sixe graines, white Hel∣lebore 5. graines, Euphorbium 3. grains, powne all reasonable small & temper it well together. After Purging. AFter purging is the sicke person to vse a comfortatiue, as hereafter followeth: Take pre∣pared Pearles halfe a drag. Galingall and Cinnamom, of each two scrup. Seduarie half a
scrup. prepared Coriander, red Coral, of each one drag. Nutmegs, Cloues, Cucubes, Coutche∣nell, Annise and Fennel, of each fiftéene graines, yellow Saunders, and Masticke, of each fiue graines, Diptamus, Misselden, pilled Pyonie séedes, of each two scrup. confected Citron pilles halfe an ounce, Sugar Candie halfe an ounce, conserue of Roses, and of Stechados, of each thrée dragm. but if the Conserue of Stechas cannot be had, take powned Stechas one dragme, sixe oun∣ces of Sugar decocted to a sirupe in Rose water, and then temper the rest amongst it. In like manner are other stomachicall things to be vsed; for which Masticke is highly commended. For strengthening of the stomacke is this shield worne: Take Mastick thrée ounces, Spike∣nard, Roses, Frankinsence, of each one drag. stampe them all together, and make it to a plai∣ster with odoriferous wine, spred vpon leather, & lay it vpon the stomacke: if it will not cleaue fast, adde waxe, and oyle of Masticke as much as is néedfull vnto it. Another. TAke Laudanum, and Masticke, of each one ounce and a halfe, Frankinsence one quarter of an ounce, Galingall, Seduarie, and Annise séeds, of each one drag. and a halfe, Roses, red and white Saunders, of each one drag. garden Mints, and Bloodstone, of each one quarter of an ounce, Turpentine one ounce, melt the Laudanum in the Tuipentine in a warme mortar with a little of the iuice of wormwood, temper the rest beaten small amongst it, and make a plaister or shield of it: you shall haue moe of these shields for the stomacke in the third part. After the vse of the purgation, the patient is to take once a wéeke at least, early in the mor∣ning, one drag. of Mithridate tempered with Balme water, and thereupon to remaine lying the space of foure howers, and to sléepe if he can without vsing any thing else the same day. A Bagge. TAke Species Electuarij de gemmis, Laetificantis Almansoris, of each one quarter of an ounce, Mace one drag. Marioram, Indy Spica, Lignum Aloes, and red Stirax, of each halfe a dra. each stamped alone, make a silke bagge and weare it on the left breast; when it is besweat, then let it drie againe. Here followeth yet many a good remedie. TAke Pieretrum, Masticke, of each a like quantitie, temper them with molten Waxe, and make small bals or pellets thereof, of the bignes of a Hasel nut, chew them and spet out the slime, kembe your head oftentimes, and annoint it with the oyle of Masticke and Spikenard: the Gargarismes which follow hereafter are very méete for this sicknesse, Take Ireos, prepa∣red Squils, of each one ounce and a halfe, Hyssope, wild Thyme, of each one M. Pieretrum one quarter of an ounce, Licebane, Masticke, of each one drag. white Hellebore one quarter of an ounce, Pyonie séede pilled, and Ginger, of each fiue drag. Raisins (the stones taken out) two ounces, Vineger halfe an ounce, clarified Hony thrée ounces: seeth all that is to be sodden, af∣terwards temper the vineger and hony amongst it. Neesing. THe Néesing (like as it is oftentimes said alreadie) is very speciall good, thereby to purge the braine. But for this sicknesse are Pyonie rootes beaten commended aboue measure, and blowne into the nose. If you temper this powder with the iuice of Rue, and drop it into the nose, then will it be more forcible, for the Rue hath a maruellous operation against the falling sicknesse, like as hath also Spikanardus: these foresaid things are also good beaten, and smelled to the other, as this small bag following. Take wild Rue beaten halfe an ounce, Siluer mountaine one quarter of an ounce red Sti∣rax one drag. and a halfe, Pyonie rootes fiue drag. temper them well together, and bind them in a little bag or cloth and smell vnto it.
Of things that may be hanged about the necke. IN this falling sicknesse are some things highly commended of all the famous Phisitions, to be hanged about the necke, and they alleage thereto also certaine reasons and experiences, wherewith they do proue and shew, that they that weare them about the necke, do not fall, and omitting it, their disease presently returneth. This is also no misbelief, like as the com∣mon people thinketh: but it is the smell or sauour, which doth most vehemently withstand this euill, and therefore is the same at no hand to be omitted. Some write also, that the red Corall and the Emerald hath the same vertue, which experience must teach vs. This happily hath bin (as hath bene sayd) a cause of some superstition, as commonly it befalleth, that good things are abused: for euery one can tell, that the Gospell of Saint Iohn, péeces of the crosse, and other such like fantasticall reliques, also sentences of the holy Scripture, haue bene vsed to vnwitch and blesse those that haue bene forespoken. It hath also bene faithfully credited, that thereby great maruels might be wrought, if they were onely either spoken ouer the patient, or hanged about his necke, for the which this péece of Iugling might also be vsed, wherein it is counsel∣led, that a girdle be cut out of a Woolfes skinne, euen from the head therof to the very taile, and so weare it about the body. But because it is not easie for euery man to catch a Woolf, the same is also ascribed to the skinne of an Asse. These things for the most part are accounted as gospel of old doting women: like as it is also with the gut of a VVoolfe, that is of many women ap∣plyed to the naules of young children against the Collicke and gripings of the belly: but these remedies following are of better estimation, and of a more secret or hidden vertue, to wit; Bry∣onie worne about the necke: also Thyme, Hyssope, Rue, and Southernwood worne likewise in the bosome, for by reason of their smell they may haue some effect. A capitall Vnguent. TAke Marioram gentle, Rosemarie flowers, of each halfe an ounce, Lignum Aloes one ounce, beate them together, and rub them well with strong wine in a mortar; temper one ounce of Barly meale, Starch two ounces amongst it, apply this to the head being shauen; it easeth the falling euill maruellously. Item, take oyle of Rue, oyle of Pepper, of each one ounce, swéet Costus rootes, Pieretrum, Ginger, Galingall, Rue séeds, of each one drag. and a halfe: mixe them all together, and so apply them warme ouer both the shoulders. Item, take Beuercod cut small foure ounces, oyle of Oliues sixe ounces, Iuniper berries beaten grosly thrée ounces, put a pint of strong wine vpon them, couer it well, and let it boyle a while: with this is the patient to be annointed in the hammes, in the armepits, and on the pulses of his hands. Also it is very good in this infirmitie to annoint the forehead with the sewet of a Stagge. Indian Baulme is in like sort good for all kind of falling euils, being annointed on the roofe of the mouth; and albeit that it cureth not the sicknesse wholy, yet will it greatly hinder his re∣turne. Vngula Alcis. IT is a common error to weare a ring of this beasts hoofe on his finger against the falling sick∣nes, I haue proued it oftentimes, but with no ease vnto the patient. A Confection or Electuarie for the falling euill. TAke Pieretrum, Costus rootes, Stechas, of each ten drag. Agaricke fiue drag. Dill séede, Assafoetida, Aristologie, of each two drag. and a halfe, iuice of Squils, clarified Honie, of each 14. ounces: boile the iuice and the honie with a gentle fire, vntill it waxe méetely thicke; afterwards when it beginneth to coole, mixe the other ingredients with it: take of this euery morning three drag. and fast foure houres after it. Montegnana taketh God to record, that he hath knowne a thousand cured thereby. This following is not much vnlike the former, take Pieretrum, Siluer mountaine, Stechados, of each ten drag. Agaricke fiue drag. Carda∣mome, Assafoetida, Aristologie, of each one drag. and a halfe, iuice of Squils, and Honie twice as
much as of all the rest, or as much as is néedefull: let them boyle sufficiently, and temper the o∣ther things being powdered amongst them. The patient shall vse euery day of this confection one quarter of an ounce, and beware of grosse meates. These two Electuaries following are very good for all manner of falling euils, except that which is caused of bloud: take prepared Pearles one dragme, Cloues, Galingall, Nutmegs, Cucubes, of each half a dragme, Cinnamom one scruple, Couchenell, Lignum Aloes, red Stirax, of each halfe a scruple, red Saunders, Calamus, Doronicum, of each fiue graines, Piony seedes péeled, Mistleto, Diptamer, of each one drag. Currans one ounce, conserue of Roses, conserue of Stechados, conserue of Burrage, of each two dragmes, white Sugar clarified in Rose water twelue ounces, make a confection of them. Another. Take Piony rootes one ounce, Mace, Indian Spike, Saffron, red Corall, prepared Pearles, of each half a dragme, Cinnamom, Cloues, Nutmegs, Ginger, Pepper, long Pepper, Cardamome, Graines, of each two dragmes, Licorice fiue dragmes, Anacardium one ounce and a halfe, Muske, Amber, of each seuen graines, clarified Hony or Sugar twelue ounces, make an electuary of them: take of this the bignesse of a Nutmeg, and drinke a little Meade after it. It is very good against the falling sicknes, the Palsey, and such like other infirmities more, it comfor∣teth the braine, maketh a good memory, and expelleth the lethargie, and al obliuiousnesse. One may vse either of these prescribed medicines, or this powder following, take Cinnamō, Cloues, Galingall, Nutmegs, Mace, Cucubes, of each two dragmes, blacke, white and long Pepper, Cardamome, Annis séeds, Fennell séedes, péeled Piony seeds, Hissope, Diptamer, Mi∣stleto, of each one dragme, Saffron two dragms, Sugar candy fiue dragmes, make a powder of them, kéepe it in a leather sacke, and vse it in all thy meates. Item, take the seedes of Maiden haire halfe an ounce, Mistleto one ounce, Tormentill one ounce and a half, make them into powder and minister two dragmes of it at once, with the de∣coction of Piony rootes when you feare the accesse of the disease. For this purpose serueth also white Mustard séedes prepared, conserue of Betony, the iuice, the water, the herbe, and the flowers: in fine, all that is made of Betony is very good for the falling sicknesse of the head, and for all other infirmities of the same. So is also the conserue of Piony rootes, séedes, water, wine of Piony, and all what may be prepared thereof, as may euidently be seene by the former re∣ceipts: the preserued Eringus rootes are also very profitably vsed therein. In like sort also Lauander, Rosemary, Spikenard, their leaues, flowers, wine, and whatsoe∣uer else is made of them: we haue also mentioned of the taking of Mithridate and Treacle: like∣wise Guaiacum is very commodiously vsed for this infirmitie. After due euacuation of the body, this is also much commended in the falling sicknesse, take the iuice of Rue two ounces, Assafoe∣tida halfe a dragme, mixe them togither, and so take them. Item, take the skull of a sound man calcined or burnt, pilled Piony seedes, of each halfe an ounce, Tormentill, Mistleto, of each two dragmes, giue it to the patient as before: the same doth also burnt Harts horne taken with wine, as also the liuer of a Kite, and dried bloud of a Shéepe, the bladder of a Boare with the vrine dried in an ouen, and euery day the bignes of a beane taken with Oxymel. Item, Rauens egs, Swallowes flesh, Wolfs, Harts, Foxe flesh, ei∣ther boyled or otherwise, the bloud and flesh of a Wesell tempered with the vrine of a man-child. Item, Buckes bloud taken, the hoofe of an Asse burnt and mixed with strong Vineger, and so annointed about the head. The liuer of an Asse taken fasting, the gall of a Beare powdred, the fume of Peacoks dung or otherwise vsed, Partridges liuers dried, and one dragme and a halfe dronken, the braines of Camels, or of Wesels vsed with vineger, the bones of a man calcined, the bloud of a Tor∣toise that liueth in fresh water, a Cuckow put into a pipkin close stopped, and burnt to ashes, the stones of a Boare, of a wild Boare, of a Ramme, and of a Beare dronken with water, the braines of Sparrowes, with many strange things more that are highly commended of diuers famous Phisitions, but aboue all other things is the reuming of a Leueret much commended, as hath béene sayd before. Euery one may vse of the premisses those that he hath approued to be good: but if this falling euill (which very seldome befalleth) be caused of bloud, then appeareth it with rednesse of the face, red eyes, and with large veines. In this case is the Saphaea to be opened, boxing cups to be set on the thighs, and legs, and on al other parts of the body. Thrée ounces of oyle of Roses mixed with an ounce of Vineger, and other cooling things more, are to be applied
to the head: also to beware of these meates, that fume into the head, and that ingender much bloud, as hath bene said, neither may the patient vse any Wine, sower Fruites, as Citrons, Lemons, Veriuice: Pomegranates may he measurably vse either raw by themselues, or mixed with his drinke. Of the Friction. THe patient is to be rubbed downwards, to wit, from the necke to the very rump, from the brest to the legs, and from the thighes to the féet, the lower the better, with rough cloths warmed, thereby to draw the matter downwards: after that, he is to vse a reasonable motion, walking, and kembing of the head. Some counsell to rub the pulses with Strawberry water: and if all this will not helpe, then is an actuall Cautery to be vsed for the extreamest and last remedie, whereof hath sufficiently bene spoken before. Of the Apoplexie or dead Palsey. §. 18. EVen as we haue generally spoken of this fearefull disease in the 9. §. this Apoplexia is the most vehement and last of all the former fiue infirmities, because it is more hurtfull and perillous then all the rest; for it often befalleth, that these Apoplectici do not only lose their speech, senses, and memorie, but also all motion, naturall warmth and nourishment, yea remaine wholly dumbe, which happeneth by reason that all the passages of the braines are obstructed, whereby the vitall spirits cannot be spread ouer the whole body: and because they are without sense, without féeling, and without all motion, do the Latinists call them Attonitos. This Apoplexia is described after two manner of waies, the one bereaueth a man of all sense and féeling, and that otherwhiles so long, that the patient séemeth to be dead, wherefore it is al∣so commaunded, that he should not be buried before the fourth day: and to be assured that there is no life more to be expected, thou shalt hold a litle feather at his mouth, which if it neither moue nor wagge, and that the bodie waxeth stiffe, then is he departed. Likewise a glasse of wa∣ter is to be set vpon his breast, and if the same be not stirred, then it is a sure signe of death. The other Palsey is somwhat easier, it doth first infect the breast, wherby all the sinewes are constrained to moue immoderatly, and to hinder respiration, and this is rightly called Apo∣plexia. Others do diuide it into thrée kinds: whereof the first is, when the patient doth drawe a little breath, but with great difficultie, as also when he fometh, his breath is not heard, but his voice a little, as if he were choked, and this is the worst and deadliest Palsey. The second hath a variable respiration or breathing, sometimes not perceiued at all, and anon returning to his former course, without fome at the mouth: this also is not without great danger, and albeit that it were cured, yet doth it turne to some other sicknesse. The third kind is, when the breath remaineth in due order. The causes of these sicknesses are superaboundant humors either in the braine, or in the bloud, ouercharging the stomacke with meate or drink, ouerwatching, debility of the braines, drinking of cold water, coole winds, rainie weather, blowes, fals, vse of many cold meats, as fruits, fishes, lettice, ouermuch sléepe, carnall copulation presently after meals, long rest or quiet, binding in the body, ouermuch blée∣ding either by opening of a veine, or otherwise. This disease is both very common, and very dangerous for old folkes, especially if they haue kept an immoderate diet before. The common and surest signes of it are these, to wit, if the patient be quickly snorting and not sléeping, be handled or pinched without sense or féeling. Likewise, the vehemencie or debilitie of this dis∣ease may be discerned by the snorting: also it is to be taken for a most sure and infallible signe thereof, if he fome at the mouth, and is by no meanes possible to be cured; so that all Phisitions herein agrée, that nothing can be done but onely to satisfie his friends, yet without all hope of recouerie. But if the patient snort not hard, then is the Apoplexie the lesse, and to be briefe, a strong Apoplexie maketh quicke dispatch of the patient, or else there ensueth a dead palsey, which is much easilier cured: wherfore it is altogether néedlesse to make any great discourse of this Apo∣plexie, and the rather, because that all the remedies seruing for cure of this sicknes, are decla∣red in the treatise of the falling euill, and of the palsey.
Afterwards héede is also to be taken, whether the face waxe red, blacke, or gréene, as it com∣monly befalleth if some part be tyed or bounden about hard: for this, are both the Saphaenae to be opened on the féete, and awhile after both the head veines, afterwards in the forehead aboue the nose. This being done, the armes aboue the elbowes, and the legs beneath the knees are to be very strongly bound, that the bloud might be drawne to the paines, yet (as it hath oftentimes béen sayd before) not to let them be bounden too long without vntying them, & then afterwards tying them againe. Also you are to pinch the fingers of the patient very hard, and rub both his eares and his nose so roughly, that it might be painefull vnto him. Some do counsell that the outward parts should be stroked downewards with wine, where∣in Ireos or Calamus hath béen decocted: also suppositories, Clisters, and boxing cups, and such like not to be omitted, nor yet the application of Oxyrrhodinum to the head. But if none of the foresayd signes do appeare in the patient, but onely a little ratling in the throate when he breatheth, then it is an infallible signe of many watrish humors, for the which this Clister following is to be vsed. Take Centory, wild and garden Sage, Rue, Southerne∣wood, Marioram, white water Mints, of each halfe a M. a little Bran, and halfe a Coloquint tyed vp in a cloth, boyle them al togither in sufficient water. Take of this decoction 16. ounces, and mixe with it mel anacardinum, and oyle of Costus, of each one ounce and a half, Sal gemmae one dragme, Hiera Picra 7. dragmes stirre them well togither, this is very méete for the Apoplexie. To draw the phlegme out of the head, shalt thou prouoke néesings with Ellebore, for the which this roote is very appropriate, or vse this following: Take white Ellebore, or néesing-woort one dragme, Beuercod halfe a dragme, Lignum Aloes one scruple, beate them to powder, and blow it into the nose; and if he could abide vomiting, the vse thereof will not be vnprofita∣ble for him, open his mouth and powre therein Oxymel of Squils with warme water, oyle of Roses, & of Lillies. Item, boyled Radishes, or horse radishes in water. Also this vomiting may be prouoked by putting a feather into the throate: giue vnto him not much meate, and if it be possible, giue him nothing to drinke but Meade, and the next day let him drinke one dragme or one dragme and a halfe of the decoction of Annis seedes. Thou shalt call alowd and make a great noyse about this patient, also vse musicke, thereby to awake him out of his deadly sléepe, which if it will not helpe, then is he to be pulled, pinched, and very roughly to be handled. It is also very méete, that this patient take euery day one dragme, more or lesse of the con∣fection Anacardina with Oxymel, thereby to bring an ague according as the cause requireth, for it is very hot: wherefore the learned dispute greatly whether an ague be a good or a bad signe in the Apoplexie. Of outward applications. TAke Cammomill, Melilot, Penniroyall, wild Thyme, Marioram, Baulme, Marioram gentle, of each one M. boile them in water, and bath or foment the head therewith warme, stampe the herbes, put to them oyle of Rue, and of Lillies, of each one ounce and a half, and ap∣ply them warme to the head; if it be cold weather, then annoint the head with oyles that are warme of nature, and with the oyle of Daffodils, of Beuercod, of Pieretrum, and such like: and not onely the head, but also the necke and the whole backe bone. Or make this salue following. Take Calmus, bitter Costus rootes, of each halfe an ounce, Siluer mountaine, Basill séede, of each an ounce, oyle of Spikenard, of Cammomill, of Lillies, of each two ounces, white Wine thrée ounces: melt all that is to be molten, and boyle them togither on a small fire of coales, vn∣till the wine be consumed, then mixe the oyle amongst it, & annoint the whole head therewith, and the backe bone downewards to the very end thereof: And if this will not helpe, then shaue off all the haire on the head, and apply this plaister following, being spread on a péece of leather or a peece of fustian, and make it as big that the whole head may be couered therewith. Take Galbanum, Sagapenum, Opopanacum, of each two dragmes, Sulfer vife one dragme and a halfe, Turpentine one ounce, melt and mixe them well togither. Now to finish this part of the braines, we must first remember two things briefly: First that it is most necessarie for this patient altogither to forbeare wine, and to drinke some small béere, or to continue with this Meade following, which is made of twelue quarts of water,
and thrée or foure quarts of Honie being well sodden and scummed. Concerning his meate hath sufficiently bene spoken before. Secondly, if his speech be altogether or very much decayed, then is the water of Liriconfan∣sie to be vsed, as it is described in the 5. §. before, and with it all manner of waters of life, which are specified in the eight part. Also Wormewood wine, Lauander wine, Spikenard wine, and the conserue of the same: but remember alwaies, that all other wines be streightly prohibited: wherefore these ought also very circumspectly to be vsed. The thirteenth Chapter. Of the Mouth, and all that appertaineth vnto it. AFter the description of the Braines, which are the vppermost inward member of the head, we will now speake of other parts, as of the Mouth and Lips. In the mouth, first is the pallet, the toung, the gums, the roofe, the téeth, the almonds, with all the other adiacent partes; as the voice, which is made and brought foorth with the lips, toung, téeth, and with other parts more. After them follow all manner of accidents that are incident vnto thē. Now to speake of the whole mouth it is to be admired, as also al other parts that are created by God: for aboue all that it containeth, it is the onely meanes, wherby euery liuing thing receiueth foode for the whole bodie. Also by this the nostrels, the heart and lungs receiue aire, without which it is impossible to liue. Thirdly, out of this procéedeth the voice and spéeches, whereby one man vnderstandeth an other, and whereby a man is different from all other beasts, which haue nothing common with vs but onely the voyce. These things are manifold, as hereafter shall appeare more at large. Of the outward parts, to wit, of the lips, hath bene spoken in the tenth Chapter: but before we come to this particular treatise, we will first of all shew all that belongeth vnto the mouth. Of putrifactions and exulcerations in the Mouth. §. 1. THese exulcerations or putrifactions of the mouth are of many sorts: one déepe, an other not: some perurulent, some corroding, virulent, as wel in the toung as in the gums, consuming and spoiling them otherwhiles wholy. They procéede of diuers causes, and amongst all other of these; to wit, if one scald his mouth with hote meates, or vse any thing which is hote by nature; likewise also hote vapors which ascend from the stomacke and vlcerate the mouth. If these exulcerations be red, the face also red and inflamed, and especially about the place where the sore appeareth; thereby may be adiudged, that it proceedes onely of the bloud: but if the colour in the face be yellowish, with heate and drith in the mouth, rednesse in the eyes, of the throte, and with blisters in the mouth, without any great swelling, and that the patient cannot abide any hote thing in his mouth; then procéedeth it of Cholera: but if the vlcers be white, without great paine, without any great swelling of the lips and gums, and if the spet∣tle be saltish, then riseth the same of Phlegma. The melancholike humor bringeth her own signs with her, to wit, obscurenesse, hardnesse, and blacknesse. These infections are thus described: The putrifaction in the mouth is, when many blisters and vlcers are ingendred, which do arrode the gums, toung, and throte painfully, running from one place to another, and so spoile the mouth. Before thou take these exulcerations in hand, looke whether they be déepe eaten into the flesh or not, new or old. If they be not big but fresh, and not ouerladen with much moisture: then vse these things following, which may suffice with some astringent and binding things admixed, as to wash the mouth with Well water, Plantaine water, and Rosewater, wherein the blossomes of Pomegranates and their pils, and also Gals haue bene decocted. You may al∣so vse Rose water mixed with vineger.
Item, the decoction of Fleawoort séedes, or of dried Prunes, by it selfe, or tempered with vi∣neger. Item take raine water, boyle therein the yellow seedes of Roses, with Galles as much as you please, and wash the mouth therewith: or extinguish Stéele made red hot in milke, and wash thy mouth often therewith. Item, take Gals one dragme, Rose water sixe ounces, vine∣ger one ounce and a halfe, put them together. Or take Roses, burnt Iuorie, Coriander, Su∣mach, Lentils, Purslaine seedes, péeled Gourd séede, & Cucumber séedes, of each halfe an ounce, beate and mixe them togither; and lastly adde a little Camfere vnto them. Take of this pow∣der half an ounce, Rose water, vineger, of each two ounces, vse it as hath béen sayd before: mixe Well water with the iuice of Pomegranates or wine: likewise the decoction of Barley mixed with Sugar, cleanseth the mouth. The water of Sage healeth all exulcerations, if the mouth be renced oft therewith. Also in a hot cause are very good all fruits that are sower, cold & astrin∣gent, being chewed, as Medlars, Mulberies, Choke peares, Quinces, Seruices, Framboies, and such like, especially if they be not ouer ripe. Also the iuice of Vine leaues, and sower and tart herbes may be vsed for gargarismes. But if these gentle remedies do no good, then purge the patient as the cause requireth, as before hath often béen shewed. But bicause this is for the most part caused through heate, he is to be purged with Cassia, sower Dates, or with the Electuarie of Roses, afterwards open the veine vnder the tong, or those that appeare on the inside of the lower lip, which is very commo∣dious for all hot infirmities of the lips. If sucking children be troubled with it, then is the nurse to be fed with cooling things, for by the alteration of their milke they are easily restored to health againe: for this purpose is the oyle of Sulphur very good, as well in yong children as ancient people, but there are many com∣mon things that are altogither as good as that. Item, take the yellow seedes of white Roses, blossomes of Pomegranates. Starch, burnt Iuorie, milke of Lentils, Purslaine séedes, Coriander, Sene huskes, of each a like much, and a little Camfere: make a powder of them, and rub the vlcer easily therewithall, or hold it in thy mouth with vineger of Roses, Rose water, and oyle of Roses. Item, for this hot exulceration thou shalt take the water of Shepheards purse, of broad Plantaine, of Roses and of Purslaine, of each two ounces, the iuice of Mulberies, hony of Roses, of each one ounce, mixe them wel to∣gither, and gargarise with it often. Item, take Gals, Pomegranate blossomes, and Cypers nuts, of each one ounce, Roses, white Bryer, two dragmes, Acorne cups halfe an ounce; beate them grossely, and boyle them in water, and wash thy mouth with it. When by these meanes the paine is somewhat aba∣ted, then mixe fresh butter with hony of Roses, and annoint the place therewith: this mayst thou well account one of the best remedies. Or stampe a fower Pomegranate with the pils, wring it out hard, and adde as much hony to the iuice; let them séeth togither vntill it be thicke. If thou wilt haue it stronger, adde the third part of beaten Acornes with it. The application of boxing cups is also very meete and fit for it: and if the patient be ful of bloud, then is the head veine to be opened. But if the blisters be white, then is the patient to be purged with Diaturbith, or with their pils following: Take Species Hiera Picra two dragmes, Species medicaminis turbith, two dragmes and a halfe, Coloquint halfe a dragme, make pils thereof with wine, take of them one dragme or one dragme and a halfe at once. It is also very good to rub them with hony and salt; but these things following are more in vse, and more fit for this purpose: Take Allum one ounce, boyle it in Plantaine water; you may also put Plantaine leaues vnto it, and wash the mouth often therewith. Take hony of Roses, warme water, & a little Allum, halfe as much vineger as wa∣ter, vse it as before, it is very good. Take Roses one ounce & a halfe, Plantaine one ounce, burnt Allum halfe a dragme, Mirtle seedes halfe as much, Pomegranate blossomes and pils of each one scruple, let them seeth well togither & vse it as the other. Item take one pinte of water, and a good peece of Ireos cut small, and asmuch Allum, hony of Roses 2. spoonfuls, let it boyle away two fingers bredth. In fine, whensoeuer Phlegma is cause of the vlcers, then must drying and astringent remedies be vsed, Cypers nuts, barkes of the Frankinsence trée, Frankinsence & Ma∣sticke: and although one should mixe these warme things with others that are cold and astrin∣gent, as Gals, Pomegranate pils, Roses, Mirtle séeds, & such like; yet is not that any errour at all, but rather a helpe. Also of these things following may gargarismes be made, or little bals
with the iuice of Peares, or Quinces to hold in the mouth. There is in the seuenth Chapter and fourth §. a water described for the eyes, beginning? Take broad Plantaine water, with Verdigrease, and Dragons bloud. This may you vse if the sore run much, and were very vncleane, for it drieth and healeth much: Take Plantain water, boyle therein grosse beaten Myrtle séedes. This cleanseth the sores, and cureth them: Conserue of Roses held in the mouth long doth cleanse the same. Oxycraton, that is, wine, water, and vine∣ger mixed together, is also very good. If this exulceration of the mouth procéed of Melancholy, then shalt thou purge as followeth: Take Currans one ounce, Burrage flowers, and of Buglosse, Epythimus, and Sene, of each one drag. boyle them in water wherein Mirobalani Indi, and Chebuli, of each halfe an ounce haue bin stéeped and decocted, giue thrée or foure ounces therof in the morning. In like manner may you purge with Hiera Ruffi, you shall also vse a gargarisme made with Currans and Annise séedes, and mixed with honie. Hereafter do diuers good things ensue for the infirmities of the tongue, that are also very good for this present purpose. Of the swollen Almonds. §. 2. IT chanceth also sometimes, that in these infirmities the Almonds or the pallet in the throate do exulcerate: of this pallet shall hereafter especiall mention be made. But for the tumor of the Almonds, and other exulcerations in the throate, are these remedies following ordained. Take a quart of red wine, Roses thrée M. peeles of two Pomegranates, foure Gals grosly beaten, Licorice halfe an ounce, Currans two dragms, boyle them together vntill the fourth part be wasted: before thou doest adhibite this, wash thy mouth with a cloth dipped in wine, then vse it warme: if it be with any exulceration, then adde honie of Roses vnto it, and wash it euery day fiue or seuen times. Aqua Iohannis. THis water is very good and effectuall to gargarize withall, both in blisters and vlcers: Take Sulphur vife, red Mints, Allume, & Sugar, of each half an ounce, Mastick, Fran∣kinsence, of each two drag. Pieretrum halfe a dragme, Aqua vitae thrée ounces: beate all what is to be beaten, and temper them together: Take Allume, Sugar, of each halfe an ounce, boyle them together in Plantaine water, mixe it with the iuice of Mulberries, wash the mouth therewith, it asswageth the swelling, dryeth and healeth. The same doth also the sirupe of Mir∣tle séedes, and of the iuice of Nutshels that hereafter are described. In like manner also Milke, and the iuice of Lettice, each by it selfe. If the throate be exulcerated within, then take Fran∣kinsence, Sandaraca, Masticke, of each one drag. red Stirax halfe a dragme: beate them together and receiue the fume therof at the mouth oftentimes: afterwards gargarize with Barley water and hony of Roses. For all impediments, putrifactions, and exulcerations of the mouth, are thrée diuers garga∣rismes prescribed and ordained: whereof some are specified hereafter, wherewith is also decla∣red how that commendable iuice of Mulberies, honie of Roses, and moe other things, are to be prepared. Of outward exulcerations, and contractions of the mouth, hath bene spoken in the twelfth chapter, and §. 14. Of a stinking mouth and breath. §. 3. THis infirmitie procéedeth not onely from the mouth, but of many other accidents moe, which the learned comprehend in the number of eight: first, when the gums doe putrifie and stinke: secondly, bad and hollow téeth: thirdly, stinking humors that fall down from the head into the pannicles of the mouth, and there make the spettle to stinke: fourthly, stinking slime of the stomacke: fiftly, the corruption of the lights: sixtly, stinking matter and purulencie, as in Phthisi: seuenthly stopping in the nose, or some exulceration of the same, as in Ozena: eightly, the corruption before menti∣oned of the mouth.
Of the foresaid infirmities haue diuers Authors sufficiently spoken, as also hereafter in ma∣ny places shall appeare. Here we intreate onely of the corruption of the mouth, in the which we may comprehend the three last causes. And first of all, if this stench procéede from the braine, and settle it selfe in the tunicles of the mouth, which most commonly commeth of heate, then is there present a great itch, heate, thirst, and drought. For this shalt thou open the head veine, set boxing cups in the neck, purge the head with Pillulae aurea, or Cochiae, wash thy mouth often with Plantaine water, or water of shepheards purse, receiue the vapor of decocted Mallowes or Let∣tice, and smell of Roses, Violets, Waterlillies, Willow leaues, Saunders, or of Cammomill. If it procéede of cold, then vse some daies together potions of Oxymel Compositum, or Oximel of Squils, purge with pill. Cochiae, and gargarize with this water following. Take Ireos, Cypers rootes, Iuniper berries, Marioram gentle, field Mints, wild Time, garden Mints, all of them, or as many as you please, vse it often: you may also draw it vp into the nose; you must beware of Fruites, Fishes, Beanes, all hard meates, and such as putrifie spéedily in the stomacke. If the corruption of the mouth do cause this stinking breath, then shall you gargarize very often with the decoction of Agrimonie, and Oliue leaues, adding as much Honie vnto it, as you thinke good. Item, take Vineger and extinguish it in gold, made red hote a good many times, with Cloues decocted in it; wash the mouth with it, this taketh away the stench: also gold only held in the mouth is very good: so likewise doth chewed Ireos. Take gréene oken leaues, beate them to powder, and take of this one drag. euery day fasting with Wine, it taketh away the stench. In the 12. Chapter and first §. in the description of the Memorie you may find a good powder, which beginneth, Take Sene leaues, Seduarie, &c. Item, take Cinnamome, Cloues, Sage, Marioram gentle, Balme, Nutmegs, Angelica rootes, and such like odoriferous things, eate and chew them in thy mouth, spet them out, and take in fresh: they take away all bad sa∣uours and stenches. Of what cause soeuer this infection procéede, these simples following are very commodious for it, each by it selfe, to wit, Auence, Cypers rootes, Frankinsence, Lignum Aloes, Cinnamome, Citron séeds, Rape sédes, Cloues, Myrrhe, Blatta byzantia, Mastick, Cardamome, Agnus castus, Spica, Squinanth, Citron leaues, Roses, Saunders, Campher, water Lillies, Rosewater, pre∣pared Coriander, odoriferous apples, Quinces, Tormentill rootes, and such like. Take white Saunders, Roses, of each fiue drag. red Saunders, Citron pilles, Squinanth, Gallia muschata, of each two drag. make a powder or little bals thereof to hold in thy mouth. A Gargarisme for all infections of the mouth. §. 4. GArgarismes are commonly made for all infirmities of the mouth, throate, and lippes, to cleanse, to heale, and to cure them, but because we haue described many such acci∣dents, and haue promised to shew some gargarisme for them, which shall be done at this present: and for that in all gargarismes thrée principall things are tempered, as the sirupe of Mulberies, hony of Roses, and the iuice of Nut shels, we will therfore first of all shew how they are to be prepared. The Sirupe of Mulberries Diamoron. THis Sirupe is diuersly prepared. The common people take halfe Mulberries and halfe Blackberries, and boyle them like to a Conserue: of this do they giue in hote diseases to comfort. Others take onely the iuice of blacke Mulberies, wringing them through a strainer as soone as they are gathered, and so with Sugar make it to a sirupe. The Apothecaries prepare it thus: Take sixe ounces of the iuice of Mulberies, 12. ounces of the iuice of Blackberries, both the berries as yet being not full ripe, clarified hony 11. oun∣ces, swéet wine three ounces: let them séeth together ouer a gentle fire till it be reasonable thick, and kéepe it in a pot. The fourth and best meanes. Take iuice of Mulberries, Blackberries, Framboys, and of Strawberries, of each foure ounces, clarified Honie eight ounces, boyle them with a mild fire till they waxe reasonable thick. But note (as alreadie hath bene said) that the berries be not al∣togither
ripe; and bicause the Framboyes & Strawberries be ripe before the rest, their iuices are to be sodden with halfe as much Sugar, and so to be kept vntill the rest be red, all these si∣rupes haue an especiall vertue to cure all infirmities of the mouth, to cleanse, to coole and to dry: for which cause also they are good to be vsed against the Squinancie, and all infections of the throte. But if thou wilt make it stronger, then temper Allume, Myrrhe, Saffron, and Veriuice, of which thou wilt amongst it, according as the cause requireth, Honie of Roses. THis hony of Roses is also made diuersly, but commonly as followeth: Take Roses that are not fully blowen, cut off the yellow tops, and to one pound of Roses put three pound of ho∣ny which hath bene clarified very well, and so place it in the sunne. One that is stronger: Take Rose buds (as before) one pound, beate & boyle them in a pinte and a halfe of raine water, wring it out hard, ad to the expressed liquor foure ounces of the iuice of Roses, clarified hony two pound, boyle them togither till it be thicke inough. The third manner. Take clarified hony two pound and a halfe, iuice of Roses new made foure ounces, set them on the fire, & when it beginneth to boile, mixe one pound of chopped Rose leaues amongst it, let them boyle till all the iuice be consumed: afterwards straine it through a cloth, and kéepe it close stopped; for the older it is, the better it is. This hony of Roses hath an easie astringent vertue, it cooleth, and is very good in all sharpe rheumes that fall from the head into the mouth: it withstandeth all putrifactions, corrosions, and white exulcerations in the mouth: it expelleth all stinking humors of the stomacke, that are caused of the gall, if it be vsed in hot feuers; otherwise it doth cleanse the stomacke of all sliminesse, prouoketh sweate. That which is made with the iuice of Roses, looseth, and outwardly it clenseth all vlcers, stinking wounds, and such like. If any man had taken phisicke, and would not willingly vomit it vp a∣gaine, he shall take a little of this hony of Roses after it. There is yet another manner of making this hony of Roses. Take sixe ounces of dry Rose leaues, put 15. ounces of boyling water vpon them in a pot that may be close couered, let it in∣fuse so eight howers, then wring it out hard, and take as many Roses more; make the liquor boyling hot againe, put it on the Roses, and let it infuse as before; this reiterate thrile and no more: afterwards weigh the liquor, and to fiue ounces of it put thrée ounces of hony; boyle and clarifie it: this bindeth the body, and comforteth the stomacke. The sirupe of Nut shels. THe Apothecaries do call this sirupe Rob nucum, and Diacaridion, which is thus prepared; Take the gréene shels of Nuts, beate them & presse out their iuice: of this take one pound, clarified hony halfe a pound, boile them to a sirupe. Some do take of the iuice and hony of each a like quantitie: this sirupe is very good for women and weake folkes troubled with hot rheumes that swell. You may adde other things vnto it, according as the accident requireth. The gargarismes which are most méete for the mouth, the throte, and the adiacent parts are these: Take Rose water, Plātaine water, of each foure ounces, hony of Roses one ounce, sirupe of Mulberies halfe an ounce, burnt Allum one dragme, white wine eight ounces, let them seeth togither as long as you would do an eg, gargarise therewith warme, it drieth and cleanseth, Take Plantaine, Knot grasse, & Barly, of each one handfull, boyle them vntill the Barly burst, straine it through a cloth, and adde to it hony of Roses, sirupe of Mulberies, of each halfe an ounce: vse it as aboue. Item, take Barly halfe a handfull, rootes of Buglosse as many, iuice of Quinces one drag. and a halfe, Violets, Currans, and Stauesacre, of each two drag. boyle them in a good pinte of water, vntill the Barly swell: this healeth, and alayeth the paine. Take Pomegranate pils, broad and long Plantaine, of each one handfull, let them boyle to∣gither in a pinte and a halfe of water being strained, ad to it Vnguenti Aegyptiaci, sirupe of Mul∣berries, and Nut shels, of each halfe an ounce, temper them all togither: this drieth maruellous∣ly, and healeth all stinking exulcerations. But you may not swallow any of it down, by reason of he Verdigrease which is in the lue. In great heate of the mouth and throate, with a sharpe matter adioyned, which excoriateth
this place: Take water of Nightshade and Purslaine, of each thrée ounces, water of Burrage and of Violets, of each two ounces, séedes of Fleawoort halfe a drag. Quince kernels halfe a drag. Dragagant a drag. and a halfe, stéepe it in Rosewater, presse out the slime or muscilage, and mixe them all together. Take Plantaine water and wine, of each foure ounces, burnt Allume halfe a drag. honie of Roses, sirupe of Mulberies, of each one ounce, boile them a little, and gargarise often therwith: this is especiall good in all tumors of the throate, and also in the squinancie. There are many more such like gargarismes prescribed for many other diseases, as euery where may appeare. There are also diuers Phisitions, which without any exception, vse in all gargarismes Scro∣phularia, and that not amisse: for it hath a wonderfull vertue. Of the Pallet, and the falling downe thereof. §. 5. IT is called by the Grecians Epiglottis, that is, the little toung, by the Latinists Lingula, Vuula, and by vs the pallet. It is also a very néedefull part and member of the toung, it hath fiue seuerall parts: first, the two almonds, Tonsillae, that en∣gender the spettle, and moisten the toung; and if they waxe drie, then do they hinder the speech. Secondly, the Aspera Arteria, or Trachea, and Oesophagus. Last∣ly the pallet it selfe. This is the onely instrument of the voice, wherby the same is fashioned, and for that cause it is placed in the middest of the throte, because it shold couer one part of the throte, and preserue the brest, hart and lights, should direct the meate and drinke re∣ceiued, to the mouth of the stomack. It befalleth often, that it hangeth downe, and so troubleth one very much, which he is not accustomed to haue before, as may be séene when the toung is pressed downe. If this procéed of heate, then is the pallet red, the veines about the eyes swollen, the face red, and the spettle swéetish; all which are signes of ouermuch bloud. But if it be white, thē it is caused of a cold rheume, which falleth into the mouth aboundant∣ly: the voice is hoarse, the face pale, the pallet white, and much longer than it ought to be. Of the tumor and falling downe of the pallet through heate. IF the pallet be red, then is the whole backe bone from the very necke downwards, and both the armes to be rubbed with warme clothes, the legs are to be tyed hard, and vntied againe; afterwards boxing cups are to be fastened on the thighs, against the fire; also if neede require, the head veine may be opened vpon the right hand. Item, a visicatorie vnguent shall be applyed to the shoulders (which is diuersly described in the twelfth Chapter and 16. §.) and so let it remaine thereon two houres long. Item, take Roses, Gals, and Pomegranate pils, of each one drag. Allume one scrup. Salt halfe a scrup. make them into powder, and beare vp the pallet with it. Or take Rosewater and vineger mixt together, gargarize with it; or in the stead of Rosewater, you may take Well wa∣ter. Water of Plantaine, and Nightshade is also very méete for the same, but it must not be ta∣ken downe. Item, mixe the sirupe of Mulberies and a little vineger with water, and gargarize therwith. Another. Take the yellow séedes of Roses, and a few Citron séedes, boyle them in Plantaine water, afterwards mingle some honie and a little vineger with it. This following is of no lesse vertue then the former: Take the sirupe of Nutshels, one ounce and a halfe, the decoction of Sumach two ounces, temper them together, and vse it certaine daies continually: if you will haue it milder, then take Barley water in stead of the other, and mixe some Pomegranate wine with it. Item, another that is stronger, and especially at the first: Take two ounces of Rosewater, one ounce of red vineger, Acorne cups, Hypocistis, iuice of Sloes, calcined plume Allume, of each one scrup. mingle them together for a gargarisme.
A Powder. TAke the gréen shels of Nuts dried, beat them small, and take a little spoonfull of the powder; hold it to the pallet, and beare it vp therewith continually: this hath oftentimes bin appro∣ued. Another. Take Allume (that is called Allumen lamenum) burne it, and vse it as before: or burne Salarmoniacke, and vse it as the other. Note also, that all the powders may most conueniently be vsed, after that the patient hath gargarized: neuerthelesse they may be vsed when one thinketh good. Of swelling, and falling downe of the pallet through cold. IF the pallet be white, then take Cinnamome, Ginger, Pepper, Pieretrum, Pomegranate pils, Gals, and Roses, of each a like much, make them into powder, and hold it to the pallet as before. Item, take long Pepper thrée drag. Ginger one drag. and a halfe, Album Graecum, that is, a white Dogs turd (of a dog that eateth nought else but bones) one drag. Allume foure scruples, Sal gemmae, halfe a drag. vse it as all the rest: abhorre not the dogs turd, for in this extremitie it hath a maruellous operation. Item, take Sage, Mustard séede, of each one drag. boyle them together in water, vntil there remaine about eight ounces, then adde one ounce of honie of Roses vnto it. Take Album Graecum, being well dried, fine Bolus, of each one drag. Allume halfe a dragme, Pepper and Salt, of each halfe a drag. make them into powder, and vse it as aboue. Take Oxymel, Mustard séede beaten, and vineger, of each a like quantitie, annoint the pallet therewith. Item, shaue off the haire that groweth on the future of the scull called Sagittalis, apply a great boxing cup vnto the bare place, and let it there remaine a whole hower long. This may you reiterate thrée or foure times a day; it draweth the pallet vp againe. What is to be done in the greatest extremitie. IF the patient haue long haire, then let a strong man take hold of it, and pull it vpward vio∣lently, vntill such time as one may perceiue that the skin is seuered or parted from the scull; then also doth the pallet ascend, because it is fast to the skin: it hath bene found by experience that it hath holpen immediatly, and hath preserued the patient from choking. But if this infirmitie be of long continuance, and that the pallet séemeth to hang onely at a little skin, and the neather end of it is much swollen, then there can be no other meanes vsed (although one is loth to follow it) but by incision to take it away; afterwards you are to vse this gargarisme following: Take the decoction of Ireos, and Licorice, of each a like much, mingle as much honie with it as you please, and a little vineger. Item, vineger and water wherein the blossomes of Pomegranate trées haue bene decocted. The order of Diet. IN this infirmitie procéeding of cold, vse excalefactiue meats, drinks, and habitations, beware of all manner of violent motions, anger, vexation of mind, feare, and such like. The confecti∣ons, Diatrion, Pipereon, Diamoscu, Diambra, and Mithridate are very commodious in this ma∣ladie: or else to gargarize with Miua Citoniorum, and the water of Sloes. Take beaten Cucubes halfe a drag. make thereof with the iuice of Roses or their water, two pils; they are very effectuall. These pils following do also hinder the falling of the rheume into the mouth. Take Pill. Elephanginae one drag. Mastick, one scruple, make eight pils of them, take twaine after supper at each time. Of the Tongue. §. 6. THe parts of the tongue are flesh, muscles, veines, and sinewes combined together, spoon∣gious and soft; which member amongst all liuing creatures, or amongst them that haue a tongue is most different, not onely by reason of her forme, but rather by the voice: and
indeed it is no lesse, for by her wonderfull motion (whereof there be thrée in generall) doth she bring maruels to passe. First, by the manner of the wordes and speech, whereby we can declare whatsoeuer we con∣ceiue in mind, and make it knowen to another body. By this groweth wars and peace, friend∣ship and enmitie, concord and discord: by this is both God and man praysed and dispraised. In fine, by this is done both good and harme, as that merry Aesopus saith in his fables, that the tong is the best and woorst péece of flesh. The second is the taste, whereby it can discerne which is bitter, which swéete, sower, tarte, sharpe, cold, hot, or any such like: also it adiudgeth what is good or bad for the stomacke. The third is the sense of féeling, whereby it perceiueth what is hard or soft, hot or cold, &c. Be∣sides all this, it helpeth to hold the meate receiued betwéene the teeth, that there it might be chewed, and thence conueyed into the stomacke. Also it serueth to gather the slime and moisture of the mouth togither, & to spet it out, which by no meanes can be effected without it, as it eui∣dently appeareth in those that haue a dead palsie, and cannot wag or moue their tongue. This member is subiect to diuers & sundry infirmities, as when the tong is heauy and flow, hard and immoueable, hot and dry; for which cause it is especially infected of Alcola, which cau∣seth it to swell, harden, and exulcerate, &c. whereof we purpose to speake hereafter. Of the losse and vnperfectnesse of tasting. AMongst the before mentioned infirmities, this is also to be placed, that in the taste, as in the sight and hearing, oftentimes hapneth that it be quite & cleane decayed, so that there remain not one whit of taste; otherwhiles also is the tasting onely diminished, as when one can perceiue some taste, yet not perfect and to the ful. Also it is oftentimes quite spoyled, as when one taketh sower for sweete, &c. As it befalleth to them that haue the yellow Iaundies, or to them that are troubled with a hot ague, wherein the patient adiudgeth all what he tasteth to be salt, bitter, swéete, or without sauor, according to the qualitie of the disease. The signes of the humor that causeth this infirmitie, are these: The bloud yéeldeth a swéete taste. Phlegma also somewhat swéetish, with much spettle, humiditie of the head, of the tongue, and of the whole body. Cholera causeth bitternesse, saltnesse, and giueth a salt fleame. If there be no tast at all, then is the mouth of the stomacke pestered with many bad and superfluous hu∣mours. If it procéed of melancholie, then is the taste tart, and astringent, of all that he taketh into the mouth. There may also very sure signes be taken of the tongue: the which if it be white, then it is not onely a signe of cold, but also that the stomacke, head, and liuer are full of Plegma: If it be red then doth it signifie that this maladie is caused of bloud, & of hot rheumes: The yellownesse is a signe that Cholera is cause of all: If it be of the colour of lead, and blackish, it sheweth Me∣lancholie to be the cause of it, vnlesse it should procéede of some vnnaturall heate, as in hot Fe∣uers it commonly chanceth. Now concerning the remedies for this lost, bad, or corrupted taste: If it come of a hot sick∣nesse or Feuer, and the patient be full of bloud, then is first the head veine, after the veine vn∣der the tongue to be opened, and a good diet to be kept, and all manner of cooling things to be vsed. He is also to be purged with a potion of the sirupe of Roses, of yellow Mirobalans, or with these pils following. Take of the Species Hierae one dragme and a halfe, shales of yellow Mirobalans thrée drag. Diagridij and Annise séede, of each halfe a drag. temper them with sirupe or the iuice of Roses, and giue a dragme of them at once, more or lesse, according to the ability of the patient. Or take fiue dragmes of the Electuarie of the iuice of Roses, or some such like matter: afterwards is he to hold in his mouth vineger mixt with the iuice of Pomegranats: otherwhiles also the iuice of Lettice, of Purslaine, muscilage of Fleawoort, and of Dragagant, made with Rose water, & held in the mouth a long time, somtimes Rose water by it selfe vsed as before. These pils following are also to be made, and holden continually in the mouth: Take Roses, burnt Iuorie, and Bay∣berries, of each a quarter of an ounce, pilled Melon séedes, Gourd seedes, Cucumber seedes, Pompeon seedes, Lettice seedes, Purslaine seedes, Endiue seedes, Dragagant, of each one drag.
make it into pils with the Dragagant dissolued; afterwards he is to gargarize with the iuice of Endiue, and of Nightshade, or with the decoction of Roses, Verueine, and Myrtle séedes. Thou shalt rub his tongue with péeces of fresh Melons or Gourds. All these things alter the bad sauour and tast of the mouth in a hote cause. But if the losse of tast procéed of heate and drought with any humor with it, which may be perceiued, if the tongue be drie, red, and without any spettle; then are contrarie things to be v∣sed for it, to wit, cold and moist remedies. Contrariwise, if it be caused by cold, then note if there be any affluxe of humors with it, or not: if there be (as commonly it befalleth) any superabundant humors with it, and if the bodie be full of bloud, then is purging and letting of bloud (as oportunitie serueth) to be vsed: if not, minister vnto him Oxymel compositum, or of Squils, with the decoction of Hyssope, Marioram, Sage, and Stechas: afterwards purge him with the pils Cochiae. A Gargarisme for the same. TAke Hyssope, and Licorice, of each an ounce, twenty sappie Figs, Honie sixe ounces: boile them in water, and gargarize therewith, and hold it a good while in thy mouth. If there be no agues with it, vse this gargarisme: Take the iuice of Squils one ounce, Vineger twelue ounces, Well water and Honie, of each sixe ounces: let it boile a while scumming it. If the patient do abhorre euery thing, supposing them to tast very vnsauorie, then he is to be purged with an ounce of fresh Cassia, with Oxymel, and with the afore mentioned water. For this purpose serue also sharpe meates, as Onions, Garlicke, Leekes, Mustard séedes with vineger, iuice of Limons, iuice of Citrons mixt with other meates: also otherwhiles salt meates. Of a heauie and slow Tongue. THese infirmities are of two sorts, the one naturall, and the other accidentall, as when the tongue cannot pronounce the letters aright, but in pronouncing the vowels A, E, I, O, V, is no want in it, because that the tongue then néede not much to be stirred: also in the saying of B, M, P, Q, wherein the lips do the greatest labour. But in these letters following must the tongue be most of all vsed, to wit, in C, D, G, H, L, N, R, S, T, X, Z. In the naming of F, must the breath be blowne out betwéene the vpper téeth and the lower lippe. If any of these be any hinderance, then may the same be ascribed to the tongue, especially if the same be inuete∣rated through a long custome, which after remaineth for euer incurable. The other that procéedeth of outward causes, and lurketh in the sinewes of the tongue, may be cured by Phisicke. Both these infirmities are caused of foure sundrie occasions. The first af a cold matter, that lieth in the sinewes of the tongue, which is to be perceiued, if they cannot pronounce perfectly the letters aboue shewed in the third row, and especially the R. Besides this also their sight and hearing decreaseth: or when one would speake hastily, and therewithall dribbleth against his will, the which is a messenger of the dead Palsey. Secondly, it is also somtimes caused of hote agues: then can the patient not draw his tongue backward, and it waxeth blacke and rough. Thirdly, this infirmitie may procéed of the toughnesse of the humor that stayeth the tongue, as if it were fastened vnderneath, and therefore could not be put foorth by the patient. Fourthly, it is otherwhiles caused of certain flesh that groweth vnder the tongue, the which if the tongue be lifted vp apparantly may be séene. The first which groweth of cold, and without an ague, is thus to be cured: to wit, that af∣ter the patient hath bene purged, he open also a veine, and afterwards wash his tongue with this water following, but he is to take great héed he swallow none of it downe. Take Salar∣moniacke, Pepper, Ginger, white Mustard séedes, Pieretrum, Licebane, Borras, Salt, salt of Indie, Marioram, séeds of Nigella, Marioram gentle, of each one drag. boile them al together in a quart of water vnto the halfe, and vse it as hath bene said. Item, boile Pieretrum in vineger, and gargarise therewith. Looke also that these things do
not excoriate the throate, and make it raw: for the Pieretrum is very strong, and therefore it is commaunded (as often hath bene said) to tye it in a fine peece of cloth, and to chew it. A Powder. AFter the long continuance of this gargarization, take Salarmoniacke, Pieretrum, Pep∣per, and white Mustard séedes, of each a like much, make it into powder, and rub the tongue often with it: but childrens tongues may you rubbe onely with the powder of Sage, or wash it with Oxymel. Item, take honie of Roses two ounces, Sal gemmae two drag. mixe them together, and rub the tongue often with it. Also make this gargarisme following: Take Sage, Hyssope, Calmus, of each a like quantity, boyle them in water. Take Costus rootes that are swéet, white Pepper, Ginger, Licebane, Rue séedes, of each one drag. Pieretrum thrée drag. Graines halfe a drag. Masticke dissolued in vine∣ger one ounce, temper them together, and make pils of it of the bignes of small Nuts. Take one of these in thy mouth otherwhiles and chew it, they are very méete to draw the phlegmaticke matter out of the tongue which there hindereth the spéech. But of the bereauing of the spéech by reason of the dead palsey haue I shewed before how the partie so troubled is to be purged and dealt withall, yet notwithstanding that, I will pro∣céede in teaching all what might happen vnto the tongue. If the same séeme to be caused of a cold and moist matter, then is the tongue to be often rub∣bed with Hiera Picra, tempered with a little Stauesacre, Mustard séede, and Pieretrum, but this is very hote and bitter, so that the patient shall hardly be able to abide it: but this following is milder. Take Salarmoniacke and Ginger, of each a like much, temper them with the iuice of Squils and rub the tongue with it. Item, Oxymel of Squils, and water wherein one or moe of the former things haue bene decocted, is very commodious: but annoint the necke and the hinder part of the head with oyle of Bayes, and of Beuercod, afterwards apply this plaister following vpon it, being spread on Leather. Take Gumme thrée drag. Stechas and Marioram gentle of each one drag. oyle of Marioram gentle, and waxe as much as is needfull for a plaister. Take Beuercod, wet it with the iuice of Sage, and make pilles of it, and hold them in thy mouth, or else take Nutmegs, Indian Nuts, Cloues, Pieretrum, Assa foetida, of each one scrup. Laudanum, Dragagant, of each one drag. make them into pils with wine, and hold them in thy mouth. So also may you hold a péece of a Nutmeg in the mouth, and chew it. Treacle, Mithri∣date, and such like confections are commended in this infirmitie. The patient must also speake much and plainely. But if it come with the infection of any other sinewes, then it is to be cured by the meanes that are prescribed in the Palsey. But if it procéede of an Ague, with a contracture of the tongue, then must you irrigate the patients necke and shoulders from on high with warme water, for that moisteneth and war∣meth the same place and the tongue also: afterwards annoint it with oyle of Oliues. How to moisten the tongue. IF then a great drith of the tongue happen with it (as it commonly befalleth in hote Feauers) then is the patient to hold in his mouth oyle of Roses or of Violets; but especially ought that to be obserued which hath bene said before in the losse of the taste, where it beginneth thus: Af∣terwards he is to hold in his mouth, &c. For this vse serue also these things, to wit, preserued blacke Cherries, preserued Raspises, and whatsoeuer else is made of them, preserued Peaches, Barberries and their sirupe, the pre∣serued red Cherries with their sirupe, and such like moe, sirupe of Mulberies, of Nutshels, con∣serue of Roses, conserue of water Lillies, and many more such like, as is shewed in hote disea∣ses and pestilentiall Feuers.
Diatragacanthum frigidum is very good in this and in all other hote diseases whatsoeuer. For this purpose serueth also Sugarcandie, the muscilage of Fleawoort, of Quince kernels, and to wash the mouth often with warme water, Vineger, and Rosewater. If there be any tumour with it, then vse the Iulep of Violets, and of Roses, dried Prunes, dryed Cheries, iuice of Licorice, sowre Dates, Manna, or which of them you please: but if the toung were fast some where, then is it to be loosed with some instrument, and afterwards to be∣strew the place with Ginger and Allume. Lastly, if a péece of flesh should grow vnder the toung, as if it were a frogge, then doth the same procéede of a grosse and tough humour: when the tongue is lifted vp, then may you sée it very red, and it is otherwhiles little or bigge like vnto a little toung. It is also somtimes round like a Hasell nut, and bigger, whereby both the speech and eating is hindered. Here must the patient first be purged, let bloud vnder the toung, and obserue a good diet, as in any other im∣postume of the head, that might also procéede of fleagm. Afterwards is the frogge to be rubbed with Salarmoniack, Gals, Salgemmae, or parched salt: or else you may prepare this for it. Take Pieretrum, Ginger, of each two drag. Salarmoniack, Salgemmae, of each a drag. and a half, Mar∣ioram, Calmus, Ireos, Daffodils, Mastick, of each halfe a dragm, make a powder of them. Of this powder may you take one part, and with the white of an egge make it into Trocisces, and when thou wilt vse them, dissolue them in Aqua vitae, and so annoint the frogge vnder the tongue with it. With this water following may you also wash the mouth very often. Take Marioram, Mints. Penniroyall. Nettle rootes, of each one M. Piretrum two drag. boyle them together in a pint and a halfe of water, till the third part remaine. But if this maladie do once inueterate and waxe old, then it is to be cured with those things that are described hereafter in bleeding of the gums; amongst which this following is rehear∣sed: Take Sugar, Allume, Verdigrease, of each a like much, mixe them with honie, and rub it therewith. Item, if this infirmitie waxe too big, then it is to be cut, taken away and healed, as all other sores of the mouth. Some do counsell to burne it, which is vncertaine in this place: but this is to be obserued, if this frog be hard and blacke, then it is doubtlesse the true Canker, which is al∣together incurable. For the Alcola, or hardnesse and cliffes in the tongue. THis Alcola of the tongue procéedeth of the foresaid hote and drie causes, when the toung waxeth blacke, drie, hard and full of cliffes. For this must the patient first be purged with this purgation following. Take Rubarbe thrée drag. Spica halfe a drag. Squinant one scrup. of the decoction of fruites, called at the Apothecaries Decoctio fructuum, which shall hereafter be described, eightéene oun∣ces; let them infuse in this decoction a whole night, in the morning presse it out, take foure ounces of the Colature, sirupe of Pomegranates one ounce, sirupe of Limons halfe an ounce, temper them together, and so take it thrée mornings together. If these potions haue not sufficiently purged (for they be very gentle) then take of these pils, Cochiae, Foetidae, Aureae, of each one scrup. and of them all one dragme; make seuen pilles of it, gargarise after that purging with warme Goates milke, and eate fiue or sixe Cherries after it. And because wine is very hurtfull in such a heate, this water following shall be very méete for it. Take halfe a handfull of Barley, thirtie drie Prunes, Barberies, Cinnamome, of each halfe an ounce; boyle them in foure pintes of water vntill the fourth part be consumed. In like manner may you vse this potion for to coole: Take the iuice of Quinces one ounce and a halfe, Rob de Berberis halfe an ounce, water of Purslaine thrée ounces, temper them together. For this purpose serueth also whatsoeuer hath bene written in the first §. of the corruption of the mouth, but especially the gargarismes.
Of the tumour and swelling of the Toung. THis is caused of bloud, or of flegme that falleth downe out of the head. It happeneth som∣times that the toung doth so swell, that it lyeth before in the mouth, wherby the spetting and all other her actions are hindered. In this you are to purge the head with the fore∣said pils. If it then procéede of cold flegme, which is discerned, that the toung or face are alwaies white, and the mouth alwaies full of moisture, then is the toung to be rubbed so long with the iuice of Onions, of Citrons, sirupe of Raspes, or with sower Pomegranate wine, vntill all the spettle and slime be gone away: for these foresaid things do separate the matter. Item, take Ireos, white Mustard seede, Pieretrum and such like, all of them, or each a part, boyle them, and vse it in the washing of the toung. Item, boile Dates, Raisins and Figs, of each a like much in swéete wine. This gargarisme is also good being vsed oftentimes. Take Fenegréeke, Raisins, Fennell séede, Lilly rootes, and Figs, of each halfe an ounce, boile them together in a quart of water, vn∣till the third part be wasted, afterwards temper thrée ounces of hony of Roses amongst it. Item, take Squils and Oxymel thrée ounces, mixe them with the decoction of Beuercod. Or boyle Rue, Cypers rootes and Pepper together, or which you please, in vineger. But if heate be cause of this tumor, that will be perceiued by the rednesse and swelling vp of the face and toung, without any spettle, and with swéetnesse of the mouth: for this you shall presently open the head veine, then vnder the toung; for this asswageth the paine, and cooleth the bloud. If it be néedfull, then purge with the Electuarie de Succo Rosarum, sirupe of Roses, or with Cassia, fasten boxing cups in the necke, that the affiuent matter might somwhat be withdrawn. Also the patient is to gargarize with sower and astringent remedies, as with the iuice or sirupe of Raspes and of Limons: the iuice of Lettice is also good for it, likewise the iuice or wine of Pomegranates. Of the impostume of the Toung. THe toung doth otherwhiles impostumate through aboundance of bloud, which is knowne by the rednesse, the tumour, the sweetnesse in the mouth, and by the puffing vp of the face with rednesse. If it procéede of Cholera, then it is perceiued by the great burning, vehement paine, and bit∣ternesse of the mouth. Or if it be caused of flegme, that may be séene by the palenesse, by the small store of paine, and much spettle, without any great swelling being spread ouer the whole toung. When this infirmitie commeth of Melancholie, then groweth the toung hard, ash coloured, and with small paine. But if it procéede of heate, then purge the patient as hath bene shewed in the tumour of the toung and Alcola: and in the beginning make gargarismes of cold things, as of Gourds, Shep∣herds purse, Purslaine, Endiue, and especially of Lettice, Milke, Rose water, or the decoction of Roses, and rub the tong with a Peach, which is very profitable for this purpose. But if by these meanes it do nothing amend, then vse oftentimes honie, milk, and the decoction of Lilly roots and Raisins, Fenegréeke, and of Fennell séede. For his meate he may vse Colewoorts, Orage drest with oile of Almonds or of Oliues, Figs, Raisins, and Lineseede chewed and spet out againe with the slime. When this tumour or impostume is broken vp, then take any one of these things following, to wit, Butchers broome, Barberies, Myrtle séede, of each halfe an ounce, Agrimonie one hand∣full, boyle them in a pint of water vntill the halfe, then adde Meade or honie vnto it two oun∣ces, and gargarize therewith often. It preuenteth great harme that might ensue. Old wine is also very good, being held in the mouth, and spet out againe. But if it procéede of cold, then purge the patient with pils Cochiae, or with the confection Dia∣turbith, and make this gargarisme following for him. Take Fenegréeke, Lilly roots, and Fennel
séedes, of each one ounce, ten Figs, Currans one ounce and a half, Bay berries one ounce; boile them in a sufficient quantitie of water: let him hold this in his mouth, & wash his mouth with it very often. It easeth the paine and ripeneth all impostumes of the mouth and throate, espe∣cially if you adde honie vnto it. This impostume is accounted the middlemost thing betwéene the vlcers of the mouth and the Squinancie: for they do agrée together both in their causes and their remedies, as hath bin shewed before in the first §. Of the losse of speech. BVt if of any of the foresaid causes the spéech is hindered or taken away, and yet the voyce remaine, and that the patient could not vtter his mind, then is he to take twice a weeke one drag. and a halfe of Hiera logodion, with the decoction of Rosemarie. A Gargarisme. TAke a drag. of Coloquint, Harts toung two dragmes, Ginger, Galingall, Costus rootes, Greines, of each halfe a drag. boile them together in a pint and a halfe of water euen to the halfe; wring it out hard, and temper with it Oxymel of Squils sixe ounces, and let it boile a while longer: afterwards hold it warme in thy mouth, and wash thy mouth therewith. This will not deceiue thée. Take Mithridate or Treacle two drag. water of Sage, of Marioram gentle, and Rosema∣rie,, of each thrée ounces, or which of them you can come by; wash thy mouth with it in the mor∣ning and at night, and spet it forth againe: and thus much for the tongue. Of the Gums and Mandibles. §. 7. IT is sufficiently knowne that children are borne with the Gums and Mandi∣bles, whence first the téeth do grow: wherefore it is first néedfull to write of the roote, and then of the trée. These Mandibles haue their situation one neare to the other, called by the Latinists Praesepioliae, that is, little mangers, for so in the old time were the mangers of beasts wont to be parted. In them are the téeth fastened, with veines and sinewes at the bottome. These Mandibles or Gums are subiect vnto many infirmities, as impostumes, putrifacti∣ons, corrosions, aquefactions, bléeding, increase and decrease of the Gums, the which are caused of the rheumes in the head, or else of vapors ascending out of the stomacke: of the which, and first of all of the impostume, now shall be spoken. Of the impostumation of the Gums. IF with this impostumation be great pain admixed, so that the impostumated Gums be red, then it is caused of heate. In this case is the head to be purged with water wherein Prunes haue bene decocted, and Rubarbe or Manna mixed with it, and afterwards to vse mild Cli∣sters: also to open the head veine, and to be let bloud vnder the tong: lastly, to fasten boxing cups to the shoulders, and to hold this following in the mouth a good while. Take hony of Roses one ounce and a halfe, Vineger halfe an ounce: when you spet it out you are to take in fresh again. If then any other sores do happen vnto them, they are to be opened with a fleame, and then to wash it thrice a day with water wherein Allume, Myrrhe, or Salt is sodden. Item, take halfe a pint of the water of Knotgrasse, Allume halfe an ounce; dissolue it in the water, wash the téeth and Gums with it: Afterwards take Pomegranate pils beaten, dippe a cloth in them, and rubbe them gently with it. In like manner you may also find in the first §. those things that are very méete for this purpose, because both these infirmities do proceede of one cause. Item, wash the mouth often with vineger and Allume; afterwards with the wine of Pome∣granates with a little Allume dissolued in it. Looke the description of the sirupe of Mulberries in the fourth §. before.
Item rubbe thy gums in the mornings with the vnguent of Egypt, but swallow none of it downe: and gargarise often with hony of Roses and sirupe of Mulberies, of each a like much, mingled with the water of Plantaine. For all impostumes and corruptions of the gums or téeth, which procure a stinking breath, and if there be much bloud and moysture with it, then is the party to be purged according to his abilitie with yellow Mirobalans and sower Dates, then to open the veine of the head, and to apply a great boxing cup in the necke, to rub the gums vntil they bléed, and to wash the mouth with this water following. Take blossomes and pils of Pomegranates, Acorne cups, and Roses, of each halfe an ounce, Stauesacre two dragms, boyle them very well togither. This following is to be vsed for to heale and to dry it: Take Roses, Cypers nuts, Gals, and burnt Allume, of each a like much; boyle them togither in Vineger and water, ad vnto this decoction as much hony as you please. After the vse of this Gargarisme strew this powder vpon the sores: Take burnt Allume two dragmes, blossomes of Pomegranates, plume Allume, Mirtle séeds, of each one dragme and a half, burnt Harts horne one dragme, mixe them well togither. He is also often times to be pur∣ged with the foresayd capitall pils Cochiae. Of the bleeding of the Gums. THis may happen of some outward accidēt, as of blowes, fals, and such like, the which must be knowen of the patient. The inward causes are either heate or cold of a sharp matter fal∣ling downe out of the head, corroding the gums and the sinewes of the téeth, and making them to impostumate: in somuch that if it once begin to inueterate, it soone changeth into the Can∣ker, whereby all the téeth fall out. But if this bloud be thin and subtile, then are these fower things following to be put in practise. First, to take away the corrupted gums: Secondly, to mundifie and cleanse that which is infected: Thirdly, after mundification, to astringe or draw togither and heale them: Fourthly and lastly, to confirme and strengthen the gums and iawes, that the matter may not haue recourse thither againe. First there are many kinde of powders in such vehemencie vsed, that the venime Orpiment is added thereto: but my counsell is to omit it, and to vse this following in stead thereof: Take rootes of Daffodils and Pomegranate pils of each a like much, make them into powder and rub thy gums therewith, and an hower after wash thy mouth with warme wine or vineger. Secondly, you may make this decoction following: Take Oliue leaues one M. and a halfe, Pieretrum half an ounce, Ginger, Masticke, Ireos, of each one dragme. Hony two ounces, boyle them togither in a pinte of water to the halfe, wash thy mouth therewith. This following is very good for all infections of the gums and iawes. Take hony of Roses thrée ounces, warme water one ounce, dip a cloth in them and rub the gums with it, & an hower after wash thy mouth with Wine or water wherein dried Roses haue bene decocted. In like manner this following mundifieth very well: Take water of Cammomill one ounce, hony of Roses thrée dragmes, temper them togither and wet the place infected with it: afterwards wash thy mouth with wine wherein dried Roses haue bene decocted. Thirdly, they are to be cured with this powder: Take Frankinsence, Aloes, Sarcocolla, and Dragons bloud, of each one dragme: beate them small, and strew them in the gums. Item, take Laudanum, Masticke, Frankinsence, & Corall, of each a like much; make them into fine powder, and apply it to the place infected: it confirmeth, hardneth and clenseth the gums & iawes: and when the sore is well mundified, then it doth also incarnate and ingender flesh. Fourthly, this following is highly commended. Take Cypers leaues, or nuts, half an ounce, Well water a pinte, boyle it vntill the halfe part remaine, dip a cloth in it and apply it to the griefe: this doth not onely confirme and strengthen the gums, but defendeth them also from all bad rheumes. Another. TAke blossomes of the Pomegranate tree, Allume, Roses, Hounds tong, Acorne cups, and Plantaine, of each a like quantitie, boile them all in wine and wash thy mouth therewith:
it strengtheneth the gummes and téeth, and hindereth the bléeding. Item, boyle Gals, Oliue leaues, Lentils, Mugwoort, and Pomegranate pils, of each a like much in water, and wash thy mouth with it. Another that is stronger. TAke Pieretrum, Lilly roots, of each one drag. the outward ind of Gals, and blossomes of the Pomegranate trée, of each two drag. beate them small, and rub the gummes therwith. Take the same ingredience, but in greater quantitie, boyle them in red Wine, and adde the fourth part of vineger vnto it; with this thou shalt wash thy mouth. By all these former things is easily to be séene, that many remedies there be for the former infection of the téeth and gummes, which are also very good for all vlcers and corruption of the gummes. Of the outward applications. FOr both the former infirmities, and for all paine and griefes of the gummes, these things following are very good, which may be outwardly applyed. Take Linséede oyle, Cammo∣mill beaten, Hollihocke rootes, meale of Fenegreeke, Butter, of each halfe an ounce, oile of Dill or of Cammomill foure ounces, this asswageth the paine, maturateth and digesteth. Item, shéepes wooll vnwashed, wet it in the iuice of Roses, of Violets, or of Willow leaues: Or make a bagge the breadth of ones hand full of dried Roses, decoct it in vineger and water, wring it out hard, and then apply it outwardly. Take cold water onely or vineger mixed with Rose water or wine of Pomegranates, and wash the mouth therewith. Item, vse the iuice of cold herbes, as of Nightshade, of the bigger and lesser Housléeke, of Plantaine, of Purslaine, or which of them you can get. For this purpose serueth all the wine wherein Gals haue bene decocted. If then neither the paine nor bléeding will cease, then is the same place to be opened with a Lancet, or Horsleaches to be fastened vnto it. But if the gummes be not apt to bléede, not exulcerated nor painefull, nor the face any thing swollen, and that the patient be not well after meate, but when he hath eaten meates cold by nature, then may you easily gesse, that this infirmitie procéedes of a cold phlegme. Wherefore euery such patient is to be purged with Pil. Cochiae, Hiera Picra, exacuated with a little of the trocisces of Coloquint, or Diaturbith. Afterwards he is to wash his mouth with astringent de∣coctions, as of the blossoms and pils of Pomegranats, Akorne cups, Allume, Salt, iuice of Rue, and such like. Also for a change he may gargarize with the decoction of Figs, Fennell séeds, and séedes of Lillies. The rootes of the blew Flower deluce prouoketh the gummes to bléede much, whereby the paine is asswaged. The decoction of Agrimonie tempered with Allume is approued to be very méete. Of this matter looke into the first §. where you shall find many good remedies for this purpose. Of the Fistula in the gummes. WHat a bad accident this Fistula is shall be shewed in the fift part, for it appeareth in this place, as in all other places with salt and sharpe deflurions: you shall cure them with those remedies that haue bene described before in the infections of the toung, and putri∣faction of the gummes, so that at this present time I purpose not to write much of it. Take Gals one ounce, Myrrhe halfe an ounce, make them into powder, and strew it on the sore. Wash thy mouth often with Vineger of Squils, or take Gals, Roses, Lentils, Acorne cups, Bedegar blos∣soms, and péeles of Pomegranates, of each a like much, boyle them all in water, if it procéed of a hote cause: but if of a cold, then boyle them in wine. If the Fistula be déepe, and the gums corroded, then take the blossomes of Pomegranates, plume Allume, of each a like quantitie, make them into powder, strew it once in three howers vpon the sore. For this serue also the blossomes of Pomgranates boyled in Vineger and Ho∣nie, and the mouth washt with the decoction. Amongst diuers other dentifrices, this that fol∣loweth
is the safest. Take calcined Allume, Plume Allume, blossomes and pils of Pomegra∣nates, Ireos, Pieretrum, Sumach, Barbaries, Gals, Acorne cups and Dragon bloud, of each a like much, make a powder of them. This powder may also be tempered with vineger and hon and wash the mouth therewith, it is very good for all manner of exulcerations of the mouth. When the Fistula is mundified to the bottome, then are you to vse incarnatiues. Others do commend the vse of actuall and potentiall cauteries, but they are nothing com∣mendable but at the last need, and in the greatest extremitie. Of the wasting away and consumption of the Gums. TAke Cinnamome one ounce, Frankinsence, Roses, of each two drag. Dragon bloud, thrée drag. bestrew the gums therewith very often. Take Myrrhe, Masticke, shels of pine apples, Date stones, burnt Harts horne and Iuorie blossomes of Pomegranats, Roses, Dragon bloud, of each a like much, vse it as before: it confirmeth the téeth. Take Pease meale, make it into little cakes with honie, and drie them vntill you can pow∣der them againe, take of this two dragmes, Dragon bloud, Frankinsence, Masticke, of each two drag. Aristologie and Ireos, of each one drag. rub the gums therewith. Of the mollification of the Gums. FOr this infirmitie are all those remedies very méete, that shall be prescribed for the wagging or loosenesse of the teeth. For a conclusion. ALthough the gums were altogether corrupted and black, yea although all the téeth were loose, yet these remedies following haue done wonderful much good. Take Worm-eaten Gals, Sumach, Myrtle séedes, Acorne cups, and Plantaine seede, of each one drag. white Vitrioll, plume Allume, of each one drag. and a halfe, yellow séedes of Roses, and refuse of Cloues, of each two drag. and a halfe, beate them all grosly, and let it boile in a sufficient quan∣titie of water: when it hath sodden a good while, then ad forty young buds of the Mulbery tree, and so let them séeth vntill the halfe part remaine. Wash thy mouth often with this decoction, afterwards thou maist strew this powder following vpon thy gums: Take Mastick, Sandaraca, iuice of Sloes, Hippocystis, of each one scrup. prepared Tuia one drag. white Vitrioll foure scrup. make them into powder. Of the Teeth. §. 8. MAn hath for the most part 32. téeth, although some there be that haue but 28. or 30. and they are differing in forme. First, there are foure aboue and as ma∣ny beneath, that are sharpe and broad, therewith to cut and diuide the meate as it were with a knife, for the which cause they are called of the Latinists Inci∣sores, they haue but one roote onely. Afterwards there are on each side of the former foure more aboue and below, which are broad aboue and thin below, and for that they are called by the Grecians and Lati∣nists Dog téeth, because they be most like vnto the téeth of Dogs: they haue but one long roote, and are made to breake that which the former haue as yet not sufficiently broken. Thirdly, there are aboue and beneath on both sides commonly twenty téeth, albeit that some haue but sixtéene, and others but sixe on each side, which are called in Latine Molares, that is, grinding or chéeke téeth. Their office is to grind and chew whatsoeuer the former téeth haue not as yet sufficiently broken and chewed. Those that are in the vppermost mandible, are fast∣ned vnto thrée rootes, the lowermost onely vnto two: although that sometimes it befalleth, that the two former of them haue thrée rootes. The Philosophers do write, that the foremost téeth are ingendred of a pure and superfluous moisture of the scull; the middlemost of a reasonable good humor; and the very hindermost of a grosse humiditie of the foresaid scull.
The paines and griefes of the téeth are diuers, insomuch that amongst the Phisitions there are accounted twelue or thirtéene kinds of them of the which we shall speake hereafter. These infirmities haue all of them sundry causes, to wit, outward and inward: which difference we purpose also to obserue. Of the paine in the teeth through outward causes. THis is caused through the continuall vse of sower and astringent things, as vnripe fruites, through much picking of them with pins, and other stinking things that remaine in them▪ also through fals, blowes and thrusts, sharpe wind, too hot or too cold meates, but especially of those that be drest with hony, which causes must be knowne and inquired of the patient, thereby to order and gouerne himselfe. Of the paine in the teeth through inward causes. THis kind of toothach is of diuers sorts, and it hath also sundry causes. First, if it procéed out of the head or braine, then is the patient not without some paine in the head: out of which there falleth continually great store of slime. If this paine be caused of the mandibles and teeth, that doth manifestly appeere. But if one doubt which tooth might first haue prouoked this pain, then let the patient bite somewhat betwéene his téeth, first betweene two, then betwéene two more, and so from tooth to tooth vntill you come to the tooth it selfe where the paine resteth. By this meanes also you may know whether the paine be in the sinewes or no, because the other téeth be nothing painfull. If it procéed from the stomacke, then is there paine felt in the same, after which doth insue vomiting, and especially of a sower and stinking matter. If it be procu∣red by the blood, then may it be knowne by the heate and rednesse. If of Cholera, then is the paine with pricking and shooting. That which commeth of Melancholy, is knowne by the great and hard swellings. Of Phlegma, by the whitenesse of the face, and by the small paine. If it be caused of many humors, then is the patient heauy headed, with much spettle in the mouth. The paine that procéedeth of drought, is thereby discerned: if of windinesse, then shall you perceiue much beating and stirring with it. Wherefore of these inward meanes, to wit, of the foure humors may this impediment be caused. The teeth grow hollow and ful of holes, they rot, the wormes do spoile them, and the sinewes are weakned, that at the last they fall away, and are so that they may easily be drawne out. How to preuent and remedy the same, shall be shewed hereafter. How to procure teeth in children without paine. NOt without reason are we to bethink our selues how to ease the yong and tender babes of that paine and griefe which they do suffer in breeding their téeth, especially if the paine continue long, as it often hath bin séene, that it hath continued three or foure yeeres. This is for the most part caused of the debility of their nature, or of wormes, which do con∣sume the moisture, whereby the téeth should grow. When this delay in téeth is caused through the debility and weaknesse of nature, then must the child be fed with rosted birds, bread dipped in brothe of flesh, and such like, according to the age of the child. They haue also a great laske commonly with it, which must be staid. The man∣dibles where the teeth appéere are to be rubbed softly: and amongst all other remedies that may be inuented for this purpose, the braines of a Hare drest with the milke of a Bitch are the best. If you cannot get them, then take butter, oile of Lillies, the fat of Hens or of other birds, each by it selfe, or mixed all together. And because that in these remedies following there be many sharpe ingredients, as Orpi∣ment, Neesing wort, Coperas, Stauesacre, Southernwood, Henbane, Opium and such like more (of which we will make mention but little) which are in no wise to be taken downe: wherefore here we will admonish and shew how they ought in the greatest need with the most safety to be vsed. First, they are to be applyed onely to the dolorous and painfull tooth with a péece of Waxe couered about, to the end it should touch but onely the place aggréeued. Otherwise they might
also harme the good and sound téeth. The patient must also hold his mouth open, and downe∣wards, that the spettle and slime might runne out; neither are they to be applyed too hot or too cold. If this paine procéed of cold rheumes, as also of the vse of cold meates, then put the patient into a warme place, couer his head with warme clothes vntill he féele the warmth apparantly. Afterwards annoint his head with the oyle of Cammomill, of Rue, of Behen, of Beuercod, and of Spica, or in place of them with Aqua vitae thrée dayes together. A hard yolke of an egge applied to the tooth is also very good, and afterwards is the tooth to be washed with warme wine: Or take vineger, wherein Pieretrum, white Mints, and Marioram hath bene decocted. Item take Pieretrum, white Mustard séed, pepper, Borras and Ginger, of each a like much, make a powder of them, and rub the teeth therewith; or strew it on a litle cotton, and apply it to the very roote of the tooth. But before you vse any other kind of remedy, take héed you purge the head very wel, that you draw not downe moe humors out of it vnto the téeth, the which may be effected through the pils or potions which euery where are sufficiently described. After purging you may vse any one of these things following: Take Mastick one ounce, Sage a M. beate and boile them in eight oun∣ces of wine or vineger vntill the halfe remaine, wash thy mouth therewith. Item take good white wine sixe ounces, temper half an ounce of Sandaraca with it, boile them together vntill one quarter of it be wasted, and hold it in thy mouth warme, and if you adde one drag. of Philonium Romanum, then wil it be so much the stronger. Or take of the foresaid Philonium two drag. red wine foure ounces, and hold it lukewarme in thy mouth. Gals decocted in vineger are also very good for this purpose. In like manner Betony or Plantaine decocted in vineger or water, and vsed warme. Pellitory of Spaine bound vp in a cloth and chewed in the mouth, draweth out much slime. Take Assa foetida, and Frankinsence, of each a like quantity, hold it on the painful tooth. The decoction of Alehoofe is also very good for it. Likewise the conserue of Gilliflowers, of Lauander, of Spikenard: Rosemary wine, Sage wine. Item take the rootes of Sperage, boile them in wa∣ter, and wash thy mouth often therewith. Others do commend Garlicke, Ginger, Agrimony, each by it self, or mixed together, and so applied to the tooth. Also the water of Marioram gentle should be very good for this vse. In like sort M. Tristrams water which is described in the fift cha∣pter and first §. Item take white and long pepper, Cucubes, Saxifrage, the barke of the Mulberry trée, Ca∣per rootes, and rootes of Southernwood, of each a like much, boyle them according to the quality of the paine in water, wine, or vineger tempered together, or each by it selfe: it is very good, and confirmeth the gums. Pepper, Pellitory of Spaine, rootes of Diptamer, and Licebane chewed together, or each by it selfe, are commonly very commodious for the toothach. These remedies following are more cooling. TAke a little branch of a Cherry trée, scrape off the outmost rind, take the yellow rind and boyle it in wine, take of this decoction in thy mouth as warme as thou canst suffer it. In like maner if the rheume fall into the téeth, then boyle Oken leaues in wine, and hold it often in the mouth: it draweth out the slime very well. The water that issueth out of a Vine be∣ing cut, is also very good for the toothach, if it be held in the mouth. Yet more remedies that are approoued. TAke eight ounces of wine, boyle it in halfe an ounce of Esula, wash thy téeth therewith thrée times in a moneth, it preserueth the téeth from paine, but it is very violent and dan∣gerous to be vsed: but this that followeth is safer and better. Take Roses and boyle them in milke, hold them a good while in thy mouth, and lay the leaues to thy téeth. Take Camfere the bignes of a pease, boyle it in two ounces of vineger, and hold it in thy mouth, it is very good for al maner of pain in the téeth. Item take of a Harts horne, to wit, that which hath bin cast off in March, cut it into small péeces and boile it in well water,
take the decoction into thy mouth warme, repeate it thrée or foure times, and after the vse of it (as many men suppose) the paine should not returne againe: whosoeuer shall approoue it and find it true, may commend and loue the experiment. Others do counsell to take of the skin of a Snake that hath bin cast off by her, one drag. and to boile it in three ounces of vineger vnto the half, & to take it into the mouth: it should also be an approued remedy. Oile of Roses lukewarme only held in the mouth asswageth the paine. Boyle a Frog in water and vineger, vntill the flesh part from the bones, & wash the téeth therewith. The iuice of Béetes dropped into the contrary eare of the paine, is also counselled of some men: likewise of Cichory, of Daffodils, and of earth wormes. But if this toothach procéed of a hot cause, then hold any of these things following warme in thy mouth, as the oyle of Willow leaues, oyle of Poppy heads, and oyle of Roses (as hath bin said before.) The iuice of Sorrel slaketh the heate greatly. You may also annoint the place with the iuice of Nightshade, of Purslaine, of Lettice, of Endiue. Item boyle the rootes of Nettles and Sage in wine. Henbane séed and Opium mixed with oyle of Roses, do make the tooth insen∣sible. If Cholera be admixed, then is the patient to be purged with the Electuary of Succo Rosarum, with Cassia, sower Dates, or yellow Mirobalans. If it be caused of ouermuch blood, then is the head veine, the veine in the lips, and that vnder the toong to be opened, or the gums made to bléed, & boxing cups to be applied behind in the neck. What else may be vsed for the paine in the teeth. ABoue in the twelft chapter and first §. haue I described a good powder, which beginneth, Take Sene leaues, &c. which is also very cōmodious for this purpose. Item take Myrrhe two drag. Frankinsence halfe a drag. Mastick one drag. and a halfe, Cuttle bone, and red Corall, of each 15. graines, Argoyle two drag. Glasse small powdered fiue drag. Lignum Aloes, Cinnamom, Cloues, Sarcocolla, of each halfe a drag. make them into powder: it confirmeth and whiteneth the téeth, and it cureth the sore gums being rubbed therewith. Item take Pellitory of Spaine, Licebane, of each a like much, beate them and temper them with a litle white Waxe, and couer the tooth therewith of all sides. A wonderfull remedy. Take the liuer of a gréene Euet, and the fruite of Tamariske, rootes of wild Cucumbers, & Propolis, which is taken out of the hole of ye Bée-hiues, of each a like quan∣tity. This may you vse for all manner of toothach, either in washing with it, or applying it to the tooth, or in vsing it outwardly. Of the outward applications. PArched Millet applied vnto it is very good. Item take Mallowes, fry them in butter vntill they be soft, and so lay it outwardly vnto the paine. Item toast a slice of bread vpon hote coales, and apply it to the chéeke where the paine is, and renewing it still being cold with another that is hot; do this eight or ten times together: for when the paine is departing then it is most grieuous, wherefore leaue it not off. But if the foresaid means do not ease the paine, then make this composition: Take Beuercod, Pepper, Ginger, red Storax, Opium, of each halfe a scrup. this being beaten, temper it with hony of Roses, and put the quantity of a Hemp séed vnto the roote of thy tooth. Item take Opium the bignes of an Hemp séed, warme it in thy hand vntill it be soft, and apply it to the painfull tooth, it asswageth the paine. If you will forbeare the Opium, then vse any of these iuices following, to wit, iuice of Sou∣thernwood, of Henbane, of Poppy, or to vse the Philonium Romanum, as hath bene before sayd: yet are you alwayes to adde vnto them a litle saffron, Cassia wood, or Cammomils, to mitigate their great cold. For this purpose serueth also Mithridate either inwardly or outwardly adhi∣bited, for it is very good for all infirmities of the téeth. It is also aduised that the patient abstaine from meate as long as is possible, and that he vse a drie bath to sweate, and méetly exercise. But if the paine be not mitigated by all these meanes, then is the roote of the tooth to be seared with a hot yron, or to be drawne out altogether.
Of the tooth-ach in the Poxe. MIxe the iuice of Wormewood with the white of an egge, and apply it to the paine. For the same vse serueth the decoction Guaiac. holden in the mouth warme; and all those things that haue bene mentioned before. Of hollow and rotten teeth. THe cause why these téeth waxe hollow and rotten, is some stinking matter adiacent vnto the tooth, the which doth putrifie the same. To preuent this impediment, is the putrifa∣ction to be taken away; which hath bin shewed before, and shall more largely be declared hereafter. You shall in no wise omit to picke and cleanse your téeth after meales with a toothpicker, and afterwards to wash thy mouth with wine. The remedies that hinder the putrifaction of the téeth are these, namely Lycium, Frankinsence, Mints, Mirtle séeds, Spica, Gallia muscata, Cypres roots, Masticke, Gals, Turpentine, Pepper, Campher, and séeds of Nigella, if there be heate with it. This water following should also preuent this putrifaction, or (if it were once entred) take it away, & alay the paine. Take of the middle rind of the Mulberry trée one ounce and a half, of the best Ginger one ounce, boile them in strong vineger vnto the halfe, and wash thy mouth there∣with in the morning. Item take the ashes of Rosemary, bind them in a cloth, and rub thy blacke and putrified téeth therewithal. Take Aristology beaten, temper it with hony, and vse it as before. Take the water of wild thrée leafed grasse, mixe as much Allume and Hony vnto it as thou please, and wash thy rotten téeth with it. Or take the inward part of gals, and as much Pellitory of Spaine, beate them to powder, and adde some Stauesacre vnto it, and lay somewhat of it on the rotten téeth. Item Borras & Stauesacre decocted together, or each by it selfe. This remedy following is no lesse commended than any of the former: Take Pellitory of Spaine one drag. Ammoniacum and Opium of each one drag. melt the gum, and mixe the rest being beaten small with it: thrust some part of it into the hollow tooth, it taketh away the sense and féeling of the same. Item take prepared Corall, blow it through a little quill into the hollownesse of the tooth, it taketh away the paine, and preuenteth the putrifaction of the tooth. Al these things may be mixed with Treacle, and so vsed. We haue also shewed diuers and sundry remedies before in the 13. Chapter and the 1. §. against the corruption of the mouth, which may also be vsed very well in this necessitie. Wash thy mouth often with the decoction of Roses, Nep, and a little Pellitory of Spaine. Thou mayst also put a little of the spirit of wine into thy hollow tooth: also any of the waters of life that shall be described in the eight part of this booke. Some men do vse Aqua fortis, and it helpeth much, but you must deale very warily with it. These stinking teeth are oftentimes the cause of a stinking breath. If the tooth be altogether corrupted, then is the only and best remedy to draw it out; otherwise must one wash the mouth alwayes after meales, with water sodden with Sal Armoniac, or otherwhiles with vineger, wherein hath bene decocted some Pellitory of Spaine, and Stauesacre. Vineger of Squils tem∣pered therewith is also very good. After meales (as hath before bin admonished) is the hollow∣nes of the tooth to be picked and cleansed of al superfluitie. If this paine proceed of cold, then are you to thrust into the hollow tooth a litle péece of Galingal, of ginger, of Cloues, of pepper, fran∣kinsence, or of Myrhe. If it be caused of heate, then vse Roses, Sanders, Campher, and such like. Of the wormes that are in the teeth. IT is euidently knowne, that if the paine be not ouermuch, but that there be felt a continuall stirring and crawling in the téeth, that the same was wont to procéed of wormes: for if  wash his mouth with warme water, and hold the hollownesse of the tooth vp towards the Sunne, then may the wormes apparantly be seene to stirre in them. For this thou shalt take
Aloes one drag. Myrrhe half a drag. make them into little pils with wine, and thrust them into the hollow tooth. Item boyle Coloquint in faire water, and wash thy mouth with it. Make a fo∣mentation of Henbane séed, or (which is safer) of Onion séeds, or of Garlicke séeds, then wash thy mouth with warme water, and spit it into cold water, then shalt thou sée the wormes swim in it. Take Myrrhe, Aloes, and red Storax, of each a like much, put a little of it into thy tooth where the wormes are. Or take Calmus brused, boile it in a little wine, dip a litle cotton in it, and lay it ouer or in the hollow tooth. In the greatest extremity make a fume with Opium, Beuercod, and Onion seeds, or with white Henbane seeds or Mustard séeds, receiue this fume through a tunnel into thy hollow tooth: but at one time take but the quantity of a barly corne to fumigate withall, and take heed the fume passe only into the hollownesse of the tooth, although you should get a little pipe of purpose to put into thy hollow tooth, and to fit it vnto the tunnel. If all these meanes bring no ease, then let it be drawne out, and bleed throughly. Of grinding of the teeth in children. THis commonly happeneth vnto children in their sléepe, through the debility of the mus∣cles that stirre and moue the iawes: this after a while leaueth them altogether. It may also be caused of wormes that are in the stomacke or intestines, but then their grinding of their téeth is not all after the same manner, they rub their noses, &c. Of which thou shalt haue further direction in the treatise of the wormes, where also shall be shewed how this is to be re∣medied. But if this infirmity do continue for some other cause, then it is commonly the mes∣senger of the dead palsie, contracture, or of some other affection of the sinewes: for the which you are to vse those things as are thought méete for euery such infirmitie. But for this it is especiall good to annoint the chéekes and the whole necke with Vnguentum Martiatum, or the oile of Be∣uercod, of Spikenard, of Iuniper, of Bayes, and such like. Of the paine in the teeth that commeth through the application or vse of cold things. AL maner of oiles that are warme by nature, applied to the tooth, or holden in the mouth, do ease this paine. Item take Bay berries, Aristologie, and Allume, of each a like much, boile them in a sufficient quantity of wine, wash thy mouth with it warme. If thou wilt haue it stronger, adde Hiera Picra vnto it. The same operatiō hath old Treacle mixed with wine, and a good while after not to take any other moisture in the mouth. Note also that whatsoeuer is vsed or applied to the teeth, may not be hot: for they are thereby corrupted and spoiled. Of the standing an edge of the teeth. THis procéedeth otherwhiles of a sharpe and astringent slime or rheume, which falleth into the rootes of the téeth: or of some other sower matter that lieth in the stomacke, and fumeth vp into the mouth and téeth, whereby the téeth are set an edge. But for the most part it is caused of sower and vnripe fruits, as of vnripe Grapes, Limons, Raspes, Corna, Sloes, and such other: for this purpose serueth Purslaine with her séed beaten together, and vineger put vpon it, bitter or swéete Almonds, Licorice, and the iuice thereof, Salt water, milke of an Asse, to wash the mouth with the decoction of Aristology and Bay leaues. These things may you mixe together, vse or chew them as you please. To hold warme wine in the mouth is also very commodious. Or as soone as euer you do perceiue this infirmitie, then chew sixe of the graines of pepper, and afterwards wash thy mouth with warme wine, this helpeth imme∣diatly. This doth also oftentimes procéed of cold, as hath bene before said. For when one will cure the toothach with ouercold things, then will thereby the small heate of them be extinguished, so that they loose their sense and féeling. Now to cure the same, you must take some kind of oyle
that is warme by nature, as I haue shewed you before, and also bite the yolks of egs hard rosted, or hot bread: to annoint the gums with the oile of Spikenard, and afterwards to hold warme wine in the mouth, wherein Cubebs haue bene sodden. Lastly, to chew Masticke in the mouth a great while, and then to wash it with warme wine. How to confirme and fasten Teeth that be loose. THe cause of this loosenesse of the téeth may be blowes, thrusts, defluxions that fall out of the head into the téeth, that (as it were) resolue and slacken their sinewes, and loose their roots. It may also procéed of a great drought, as it hapneth vnto them that recouer of a long lingring disease: the corruption of the mouth and teeth may also cause the same. The signes of this loose∣nes of the téeth may be discerned by beholding them diligently. The cure of this infirmitie is comprehended in two principall points: to wit, in a good regi∣ment or diet, and in the adhibition of good remedies. First, he must take héed not to bite hard vp∣on any thing, but to vse soft meates: also not to speake much, thereby to eschew the cold aire: also he is not to sléepe with an open mouth, neither are the téeth to be touched roughly either with the fingers or with the toong. If this loosenesse of the téeth do come of blowes and such like, with an euident heate, then is he to vse the pils and blossomes of Pomegranates, Medlars with their leaues and rinds, Ser∣uices, Quinces, Lycium, Gals, Butchers broome, burnt Iuory, Roses, Saunders, Ambers, Mi∣rabolan stones, Date stones, red Costus pils, Hypocistis, sealed earth, fine Bole, burnt Harts horne, sea Muscles, and al that may be made and sodden with these things. But if these procéed of cold, then vse Laudanum, Frankinsence and her bark, parched Cumin séed, Cresses séeds, parched An∣nise séeds, Allume, pitch, Myrrhe, parched salt, Cipres nuts and leaues, Mastick, Sarcocolla, San∣daraca, and all that may be made with it. Here now do follow some things that confirme and fasten the téeth, gums and their sinewes. Take garden Mints, fresh Oliue leaues (if they may be had) of each an ounce, Roses, Mirtle seed, Butchers broome séed, wood of the Barberry trée, and the fruite of the same, of each halfe an ounce, beate, cut, and boile it in vnripe wine, and hold it in the mouth. Water of Nightshade, of Plantaine, and of Shepheards purse do fasten the téeth; and if in this water and vineger toge∣ther you boile the blossomes of Pomegranates and Mirtle séeds, then will it be the better. In like maner you may boile Gals, Medlars, Lentils and Seruices, of each halfe an ounce. For this purpose serue also Cipres nuts and leaues, Acorne cups and Sene leaues, al together, or each by it selfe, decocted in wine, and vsed as the former. Item take Allume, Frankinsence, Masticke, Cypres nuts, Rosemary flowers, of each a like much, boile them together in a sufficient quantity of raine water and red wine, and wash thy mouth with it very often warme. Item take Harts horne, salt and Myrrhe, all of them burnt, of each two drag. boile them in hony, and rub thy gums therewith within and without. Item take burnt Allume halfe an ounce, Rose buds halfe a handfull, Bedegar, red wine one pint, boyle them vnto the halfe, take of this being warme into thy mouth often, and hold it a good while therein, for it is very good. Another. Take Ireos, Corall and Frankinsence, of each halfe a drag. temper it with hony of Roses to a confection, annoint the teeth therewith, and in the morning wash them with wine wherein hath bene decocted Sage, Rosemary and Roses, of each a like much. Item take Allum, burnt Harts horne, Roses, Dragon blood, Acorne cups, Hyppocistis, blossomes and pils of Pome∣granates, Gals, of each a like quantity, boile them in strong red wine or in vineger, and wash thy mouth therewith. Vineger and Oxymel of Squils are also especiall good for this vse. To wash the mouth often∣times with Rosemary wine, confirmeth the gums, and fasteneth the téeth. Of the falling out and drawing of the teeth. THe last and extremest meanes for the toothach, is, that the téeth might either fall of them∣selues, or be drawne out. To preuent the falling of them is vnpossible to many men, yet are these things following prescribed for it, amongst which this that followeth is very sharpe, and yet for all that very safe and good to be vsed.
Take the barke of a Mulberry trée, Caper rootes, Pieretrum, the bigger and the lesser Esula, red Orpiment, rootes of Coloquint, of each two drag. put as much vineger on them as wil couer them, let it so rest eight dayes, and euery day put a little more vineger vnto it, and vse it as hath bene said. Open the gums round about the tooth as much as is possible with some kind of instrument, then rub them ten times in one day with the foresaid water; it maketh the tooth loose, and sepa∣rateth the roote. Item open the gums as before, annoint it with oyle wherein Frogs haue bene decocted: & when the tooth is very loose, then take it out. You may also do as hereafter followeth: Take Pellitory of Spaine, Scammony, white Hellebore, Euphorbium, of each one drag. beate and stéepe it in vineger, open and loose the gums about the tooth, and rub it often therewith; it is very forcible, and therefore to be the more regarded. Item take Nettle séeds, roots of the Mulberry trée, and roots of Celendine, of each a like quan∣tity, boyle them in wine or vineger: this should haue the same operation with the former, and it is much safer. Another. Open the gums, and lay bare the roote of the tooth, and strew Euphorbium in it, this will doubtlesse loose the tooth, that it may easily be taken out: afterwards wash thy mouth with the decoction of Myrrhe, for thereby will the place or hole be drawne together, and all paine a∣bated. Take the dregs or lées of strong vineger, and apply it to the tooth many dayes together: after∣wards draw out the tooth. But if it will not stirre, then rub the place with fresh butter or some other grease of birds, and especially with the braines of a Hare sodden, which haue a hidden ver∣tue and operation for this purpose, as before hath bene said. This remedy following applied to the tooth, maketh the same to fall out without any paine. Dissolue two drag. of Ammoniacum in vineger, temper Henbane séeds beaten amongst it, and annoint the tooth and the roote thereof. Item take the iuice of Esula with meale, make a dow of it, temper it well, and let it boyle a while, and apply it to the tooth. Of the double tooth. OTherwhiles two téeth grow vnnaturally one before the other, which is not onely vn∣séemely, but hindereth also very much; wherefore it must be taken away with an in∣strument, and with applications. If you will take it away by application, then are you first to loose the gums from it, and make a little ball of Waxe, and mixe the iuice of Esula or of Néesewoort with it. The same doth also the blood of a leafe frogge. Or take the roote of a Mul∣berry trée and Pellitory, of each halfe an ounce, wet them in vineger, and dry them in the Sun vntill they be as thicke as hony, then temper them with the foresaid iuice of Esula, and annoint the tooth thrice a day with it, and it will easily fall out. The iuice of the rootes of Nettles mixed equally with Galbanum should do the same. In like manner also beaten Fig leaues applied to the tooth. To make and to keepe the teeth cleane. TAke Cuttle bone, white sea Muscles, Spuma maris, Allume, Aristology, parched Barley, Sulfer vife, Cinnamom, and long pepper, of each a like much, temper it with hony, and rub the téeth often therewith. Or take Argoile two drag. beate it small and searce it, wash it with good wine, rub the téeth once a day with it, and afterwards wash thy mouth in the winter with warme, and in summer with cold wine. This following is highly commended. Take two drag. of Date stones, red Corall prepared thrée drag. Lupins, and the rootes of the yellow Flower deluce, of each thrée drag. beate all that is to be beaten, and afterwards make a confection of it with clarified hony, which must be so hard that you may make small placents or trocisces of it, dry them in the shadow: when you wil vse them, then dissolue one of them in wine or vineger, and wash thy téeth therewith euery morning, when thou hast first rubbed them well with a cloth, & kéepe the moisture a good while in thy mouth. Item take burnt Oister shels, and Sandaraca, of each half an ounce, Ireos two drag. Aristology, Gentian and Centory, of each half
a dragme, vse it as before. It is bitter, but it drieth and cleanseth much. Or take one drop of the oyle of Vitriol, wet the teeth with it, and rub them afterwards with a course cloth: this taketh away all blacknes of the teeth, but it is very sharpe. The same operation is ascribed vnto the oile of Sandaraca Take Allume and salt, of each a like much, beate it small, distill it in a glasse Lembicke, and rub thy teeth therewith. These last three things are very strong, and my counsell is to refraine them. But if one would kéepe his teeth cleane, then are not those things to be vsed that do change the naturall white colour of the teeth into another hew. The causes are both outward and in∣ward, as the long vse of tincting or colouring meates, and the continuall dressing of the same in brasse pots. There groweth also a hard substance to the téeth, which may be called Argoile. The inward causes may be a corrupted and foule stomack, which commonly doth colour them green, and especially when one hath oftentimes eaten many Toadstooles. The cure thereof is this: if it be caused of bad meates, then must the patient first of all be let blood. If the téeth be pestered with Argoile, then is the same to be taken or scraped off gently. And because this colouring of the téeth doth only procéed of bad humors, they are therefore often to be rubbed with parched salt, afterwards with the dentifrices or powders that make white téeth, (which shal be described hereafter) and rub them therewith: and last of all with a peece of Scarlet dipped in hony. How to make the teeth white. TAke Venice glasse, mole it vpon a marble stone vntill it be very small, adde vnto it white pibble stones burnt, in like sort poudered, and Ireos, of each a like quantity, rub the teeth therewith. Item take burnt Date stones, red Corall prepared, of each two drag. put them mixed together in a péece of linnen cloth, stéepe it in wine, and rub the teeth with it: this maketh them white and strong. Another. Take Pumice stone, Cuttle bone, and red bricke, eg shels, the white skin taken out of them, prepared red and white Coral of each half an ounce, Pellitory of Spaine, burnt Allum, of each two drag. and a half, Ireos two drag. Sandaraea thrée drag. Mastick, Myrrhe, of each half an ounce, make them into powder, and vse it for a dentifrice. Item take Pellitory of Spaine, burnt Allum, of each two drag. and a halfe, Dragons blood, blossomes of the Pomegranate trée, of each half a drag. mixe them together, and vse it as before. Some do vse the Cuttle bone only, others only egshels, they are both very good and safe. How to preserue the teeth from all accidents. MAny Phisitions do write, that whosoeuer will preserue and kéepe good téeth, he must ob∣serue two things especially: first they do commaund not to vse Milk, Fish, Radishes, dry Figs, dates, sodden hony, and al other meates that be dressed therewith. Also to abstaine from sower and gréene apples and peares, prunes, Seruices, Medlars, Limons and Garlick, all which by nature are hurtfull vnto the téeth. In like maner all things that are very hot or very cold, and especially the sudden change of hot or cold meates. A good diet is also very commodious for this purpose; vomiting (as before hath bin shewed) is very bad and hurtful: also to bite on very hard things. The téeth are alwaies to be kept cleane, that nothing remaine betwéene them and stinke. The meanes whereby the téeth are preserued and kept good, are these, to wit, that you rub them often with the barke of Tamariske, with the péels of Pomegranates, with the rind of an Ash trée, with blossoms of the Pomegranate trees, or with red blossomes of the Peach trée: they cleanse the téeth and confirme the gums. You may also temper white Sugar with Hony, and rub the téeth therewith: in cold causes with the oyle of Behen; in hot causes with the oyle of Roses. Item take the powder of a burnt Hares head, rub the téeth and gummes therewith: or take Hony and Salt, and burne them to ashes: beaten Lupins are also very commendable with any addition. Item beate Myrrhe and plume Allume into powder, or temper burnt Allu with vineger, and wash thy mouth with it: or else take burnt Harts horne, séedes or flowers of Tamariske, Cipres rootes, Roses, Spikenard, of each one scrup. Salt halfe a scrup. make it into powder and rub thy téeth with it. Myrrhe sodden in Wine, and the téeth washed therewith,
fasteneth the téeth, and drieth the superfluous humidity of them. Chew Mastick and rub the téeth and gums with it, it maketh them cleane and strong. The téeth also are alwayes to be kept cleane and pure, and not to pick them with an iron, but with a toothpicker made of Lentiscus, which is the trée whereof droppeth Mastick, which is much commended for the teeth: remember also to wash the téeth after euery meale. The fourteenth Chapter. Of the Voice. WE haue concluded before in the 13. Chapter the voyce to be the last part or portion of the mouth, which part is onely proper vnto all those liuing creatures that haue lungs: for although fishes and some other beasts séeme to haue a voice, yet it is nothing else but a noise; for a true voice procéedeth of an open breast. Also the voyces of all females are much lesse (except the Cow) then of males. But it is not our intent to speake of any other voyces, but onely of the humane voyce. Amongst all liuing creatures you shall hardly find any thing more changeable and inconstant than the voyce. For behold a man or woman from childhood euen to old age, and you may easily perceiue the mutability of it: and which is aboue all things to be ad∣mired, that those children which speake very timely or yong, begin to go very late. It is also no lesse maruel that this voice being shut vp and included in something, can neuertheles be vnder∣stood. As for example, put a long trunke to another bodies eare, speake in it what and as softly as you please, yet shal he perfectly vnderstand euery word of your saying. Likewise you may as wel know one by the voice as by sight: for it is most sure, that if you heare one speak and sée him not, you shall as well know him by his voyce, as if you saw him and heard him not. In like maner the voice maketh great difference both in words and in names in diuers spée∣ches ouer all the world. It bréedeth great delight by abreuiating, and extending, by singing high or low, soft or aloud in musick. And in this it excéedeth all other parts whatsoeuer, and is the only meanes, whereby we may disclose and make knowne our hidden thoughts and secret con∣ceits of the mind vnto our friend: also there is nothing else in which we differ from brute beasts but onely in the voice. We will not speake of any weake voices, which are caused of some long sicknes: for we haue already written of them before in the thirtéenth chapter. But we purpose only to treate of those things that do corrupt or spoyle the voyce, as of hoarsnesse and such like. If the voyce be decayed of a cold cause, then drinke halfe a drag. of beaten cubebs at your ly∣ing downe, sodden in thrée ounces of the decoction of Guaiacum. The common people thinke it a good experiment to stéepe Horstongue in wine, and to drinke the same. But the tabulats of Diaireos are especially commended, which are made as followeth:Diaireos. Take Ireos halfe an ounce, Penniroyall, Hyssope, Licorice, of each thrée drag. Dragagant, bitter Al∣monds, Pine apple kernels, Cinamom, Ginger, Pepper, of each one drag. and a half, figs, dates, Currans, of each fiue scrup. red Styrax three scrup. and a halfe; and for euery ounce of this pow∣der, take twelue ounces of Sugar, cut the fruits small, beate all the rest and make tabulats, or an Electuary of them. This is called at the Apotheries Diaireos Salomonis. Another. Take Ireos halfe an ounce, Sugarcandy, and the abouenamed spices without Su∣gar two dragmes, Sugar twelue ounces, boyle it in the water of Hyssop vntill it be thick, then make tabulats of it. Both these kinds of Diaireos are good for the cough, proceeding of a cold rheume, and for a whéesing breath. Of Hoarsnesse. §. 1. THis hoarsnesse proceedeth of many and sundry causes, but especially of cold and sharp hu∣mors that fall out of the head into the throte, and there make it dry, whereof shall be spo∣ken at large when we shall speake of the infirmities of the throte: we will now only shew
what is conuenient for the roughnesse and hoarsnesse of the same; for the which Sugarcandy holden in the mouth very often is very commodious: also the confectiō Diatragacanthum, where∣of there be two sorts, to wit, the hot and the cold, which may be made as hereafter followeth. The cold Electuary of Diatragacanthum. TAke white Dragagant one ounce, gum Arabeck fiue drag. Starch two drag. Licorice, péeled Melon seeds, Gourds séeds, Cucumber and Pompeon séeds, of each one drag. Campher fiue graines, sugar pennets one ounce and a half, beate them to powder. If thou wilt make tabulats of it, then take of this powder one ounce, of the best Sugar twelue ounces, boile it in water of Violets as it behoueth. This confection is also very good for all infections of the lights, and of the breast, which do procéed of heate and drouth, and especialy for them that are declining to a consumption, and them that haue a dry cough doth it much helpe. The hote confection of Diatragacanthum. TAke Dragagant, Hyssop, of each two ounces, pine apple kernels, swéet Almonds, and Lin∣séed, of each three drag. Fenegréeke, Cinnamom, of each two drag. iuice of Licorice, Ginger, of each one drag. make it into an electuary or confection as before. This is very good for them that haue a tough and slimy cough, and that cannot get vp any thing: also for all them that haue a whéesing and short breath, and that are subiect to a consumption. Take Iuiubes, boyle them in water, stéepe Cotton seeds in it, and hold them in thy mouth a long time: it hath a maruellous operation in all hoarsnesse, drought, and roughnesse of the throate. Amongst all other things that haue bin found good by experience, the tabulats of Diatraga∣canth are much conmended: wherefore euery night when you go to bed shall you dissolue one of them in swéet wine, adding halfe a scruple of Saffron vnto it, and drinke them all together; this hath cured many men of an inueterate hoarsnesse. A good potion. Take fiue pints of water, half a pint of hony, sixe Figs, one ounce of Currans, two drag. of Licorice, boyle one pint of it away, and scum it well, drinke euery morning fasting a good cupfull warme: you shall also temper or mixe your wine with it. This potion is also very commodiously vsed against the cough. Hony of Roses is also very good for all drouth and hoars∣nes of the throate, for it moisteneth and easeth it. In like maner also the conserue of Roses, oile of sweet Almonds, sirupe of Violets and Hony water, which commonly allayeth all roughnesse of the throte. But if this hoarsnesse procéed of a cold rheume, then is Fennell seed very profitably vsed, howsoeuer it be adhibited: but for this purpose are confected Cumin séeds, Caru and confected Almonds much better. Likewise whatsoeuer shall be written hereafter in the second part of this booke for the cough, may also be vsed in this infirmity. How to make a cleere voice. §. 2. ONions and Garlicke, as also the Hyssop wine, are much commended for to make a cléere and good voyce, also the tabulats called Diaireos Nicolai. This electuary following is also much commended for this purpose. Take Cab∣bage séeds, Hyssope, Elecampane rootes, Fole foote, rootes of the Flower deluce, Hore∣hound, of each half an ounce, Annis séeds, Fennel séeds, Ameos, Cubebs, Aristology, of each one drag. and a halfe, Oxymel compositum, Sirupus de Prassio, of each thrée ounces, Sugar pennets thrée drag. Pineapple kernels that haue bin infused in Vine cuict two dayes foure oun∣ces, Saffron one drag. clarified hony twelue ounces, temper it to a confection or electuary. Take of this in the morning halfe an ounce, with two ounces of the decoction of Nettle rootes. If it be not too much trouble for you, take one halfe of it in the morning, and the other halfe at night, mixed with a little Sugar. This may be vsed for all harshnes and hoarsnesse of the throte. The water may you alter or change according to the quality of the disease. And so we end the first part of this our Booke.
The second part of this Practise of Phisicke, Containeth the Breast. THe Anatomici, by deuiding mans body into the outward and inward members, do affirme the second part of the same to begin in the vpper∣most part next vnder the Head; thence to extend it selfe downewards vnto the Midriffe, which is a skin that parteth the Heart and the Lights from the Belly. This part maketh shew outwardly of very few mem∣bers, to wit, of the Necke, of the Breast, Ribs, Shoulders, and vpper parts of the Backe; and containeth inwardly two of the principallest members, as the Heart and Lights: of the which, and of the diseases of the same, and how they are to be holpen, shall now be shewne. The first Chapter. Of the Necke. THere is none other disease to be séene in the Necke outwardly, then a swelling or tu∣mor, which is called Bronchocele, the which either commeth by nature, or else of some outward cause: the same chanceth also sometimes to swell inwardly, although that commonly depend and is caused of the first swelling. Of Bronchocele. §. 1. IF any man haue this tumor in the throte by inheritance or discent from his parents, and naturally is borne with it, as commonly happeneth in Bintsgaw, and in many places moe, whereof at this present shall not be spoken: for that all Phisitions here∣upon conclude, that they are altogether incurable. But that which is not naturall, which procéedeth commonly of flegmaticke or waterish humors; with the which otherwhiles wind is admixed (by ioyning both together) bréedeth knots on the necke. For by experience it hath bin found, that when these Tumors haue bin opened by incision, that sometimes there is found nothing in them but water, therfore is the same called a watery Bronchocele. Sometimes there will be therein a thick matter like Hony, and otherwhiles a tough ashcoloured slime, as it were snot or sniuel. Lastly, it hath also bin séene, that there is but a little water in it, with much wind, which in opening (euen as other wind) is let out and flieth away. These tumors are cau∣sed most of cold raw Northerne winds, and of thick slimy flegme, whereby all such flegmaticke defluxions are increased: also through continuall vse of grosse meates that augment Phlegma. When as such swellings appéere, then must you not delay and rest thereon, but séeke some re∣medy betimes, and not follow the counsell of such as do say, that it will weare away of it selfe. The order of diet. IT is first néedfull that he take héed of eating vnleauened bread: in like sort of all young sucking beasts, and that are fat and slimy, as Swines flesh, fish, and chiefly sod milke, and all that is drest therewith: also of moist fruits, as Cherries, Peares, Apples, Haselnuts, and Melons: also of cold and moist herbes, as Béetes, Spinage, Lettice, Endiue, Purslaine, Ver∣iuice, and fresh butter. But contrariwise, warme and dry dwellings, situate in the East and South, are very good, and not much sléeping, for that increaseth much flegme: also quiet and idlenesse are hurtfull. Therefore are all such patients to endeuour themselues to go and walke
much, and to hold alwayes the head vpright. And if that cannot be done, let them be rubbed with hot clothes from their heads downewards towards their féete, vntil the skin be red there∣with, and also both their féete. Their heads shall be seldome washed, and then only with lie and Sope after the driest manner, like as you may find a good instruction thereof in the discouery of the headach. Their drinke shall be small white Wine, that is old and of a good tast, the which must be delayed with decocted water: in their meates they must beware of all superfluitie, and arise from their meales with appetite: also they must chew their meate well before they swal∣low it. Now to the remedie of this Tumor, first you shall prepare the humor whereby this swel∣ling is caused with Oximel of Squils, which is acuated with Pepper and Pellitory of Spaine. This must be continued certaine dayes fasting, taking two or three ounces mingled with wine. In like maner (if néed require) open a veine: afterwards vse this laxatiue powder following, whereby the corruption may be drawne out of the head and out of the stomacke, the braines strengthened, and all humors consumed that run towards the swelling. Take beaten Hermo∣dactili, Turbith, of each one drag. Ginger two scrup. Diagridion sixe graines, flowers of Esula halfe a drag. mingle them together: you are to giue at once halfe a drag. of this powder or two scrup. at the most, tempered with thrée ounces of Meade once euery weeke, and that early in the mor∣ning; whereupon he must fast foure houres. And this shall he take continually a whole moneth together. Prepare also this following, and it will consume the corruption and the wind, whereby the Tumor is caused: Take Cammomill, Melilot, of each one ounce, Annise séedes, Rue, of each one ounce and a halfe, dried Goose and Pigeon dung, Sal gemmae, of each two ounces, all beaten grossely. Of this compound take a handfull, and stéepe it eight houres long in Sopers lie, and then let it seeth a little; make a spunge wet therein, and bind it warme on the griefe. Take one of these waters following, the which you can get best, to wit, water of Aristologie, of wild Cu∣cumbers and Rosemary, make a spunge wet that will couer the same and the places about it, wring it out, and lay it warme thereon, and renew it often. You must also annoint the part in∣fected and the places about it with warming oiles, and then lay this plaister following. Take of Diaculum magnum (called the Apostolicon plaister) Ammoniacum, of each a like quan∣titie, temper therewith Ireos, and Sal gemmae, both beaten, as much as the other, spread thereof vpon leather: thrée dragmes of Opopanacum, Litharge of siluer, Ammoniacum, Galbanum, of each one drag. Myrrhe, Miscleden, Frankinsence, of each one drag. and a halfe, Gipa, Bolus, Aloe, of each halfe a dragme, the muscilage of Hollihocke halfe an ounce, Tupentine one ounce, or as much as is néedfull: powne all that is to be powned, dissolue the gums in vineger, and temper the powder therein, and then make it into a plaister with waxe. This is also good for Bron∣chocele. Diuers powders for the same. TAke Hasell nuts, Spunges, Sea-bals, writing paper burnt all together, Cuttle bones, and séeds of Plantaine, of each half an ounce, Pepper, Ginger, Sal gemmae, Pumice stones, Nut∣megs, Gals, white and long pepper, Cinnamom, black and white Hellebore, of each one quarter of an ounce; make them into powder, and giue thereof euery morning halfe a drag. The Helle∣bore or Néesewort is somewhat dangerous, therefore this following is safer: Take new spun∣ges, and burne them in a luted pipkin or pot vntil they may wel be beaten, and giue him thereof euery morning with wine one drag. Another which is much vsed: Take cleane washt spunges foure ounces, burne them in a luted pot with halfe an ounce of Spunge stones, Pumice stones, and Cuttle bones, of each one drag. red cloth burnt like to the spunges, halfe an ounce, mingle them and vse them as before. Make also this gargarisme: Take Oxymel of Squils one ounce, si∣rupe of Calamint one quarter of an ounce, blew Ireos and Marioram gentle, of each two oun∣ces, temper them all together, and therewith you are to gargarize morning and euening euery other day. Let him smell to this that followeth: Take Rosemary flowers, Marioram gentle, and Spica, of each one quarter of an ounce, Lignum Aloes one drag. and a half, Mace, Ameos Laudanum, red Storax, of each one drag. Amber halfe a drag. powne each a part, and bind it vp in a péece of silke, and let him hold it alwayes in his hand for to smell to.
Capitall powders. TAke Cucubes, Nutmegs, Lignum Aloes, Rosemary flowers, Swines bread, of each halfe a drag. Sandaraca one quarter of an ounce; powne them and temper them together: take eue∣ry morning fiue greines thereof, and strew it on the top of the head. Or make a little bag fiue singers long and thrée fingers broade, and lay it on the head. Take the herbe called Harts toong, beate it small, mingle it with egs and meale, bake cakes thereof, and take alwayes thereof be∣fore meales, especially one houre or more before noone, about one quarter of an ounce. If one haue something sticking in his throate. §. 2. IF one haue a great bit of meate sticking in his throate, then are you to clap him behind aboue and vnder his necke, that thereby the meate may be remoued, ei∣ther by vomiting it out, or swallowing it downe towards the stomacke. In like manner also, you are to giue him water oftentimes, or rather oyle of Roses to gargarize therewith, and let it downe: for it dilateth the throate, and maketh it slippery, whereby the same bit will sinke downe the better. And this is also good for all slimy things, as Raisons and Figges sod in Meade. Item take bread, chew it not too small, and swallow it downe. Do the like with Figs, for they are very commodious for this purpose. Item take a bit of hard sodden flesh, bind it on a strong thréed, and slide it downe, and afterwards plucke it out againe: if the bone or any thing else that sticketh therein cannot be forced downewards, then with a mullet or other instrument draw it out. But if so be that all those things will not helpe, then may you vse a leaden pipe which is thoroughout full of holes, somewhat smooth without, and somewhat bent, which you may thrust into his throate to the neather part by force. Take the muscilage or slime of Linséed, Butter, prepared Cassia, oile of Almonds, of each a like much, lay them on the throte. The vomiting after meate is also found good for this intent, and is therefore to be moued. When a Horsleach taken in drinke remaineth sticking in the throate. §. 3. ONe shall perceiue this, not onely by the place where the same was drunken, but also by the biting and tickling in the throate, and by the cleere blood that he auoi∣deth, and by the wambling and vomiting. For this you are to presse his tongue downwards, and to looke into his mouth whether the Leach can be séene or not; if yea, to take it by the head with a mullet and draw it out; if not, then must you make a gargarisme with Mustard séed & vineger, or with vineger & Assa foetida, or with vineger and salt, which you will, and gargarize therewith. Or you may blow beaten Mustard séed, and Nigella séed into his throate. Also you may gargarize with Onions, or the decoction of Garlicke. The ashes of our Ladies thistle blowne into the throate, is commen∣ded aboue all the rest. The roote of Gentian beaten, and all that is bitter. When as the Hors∣leach is fallen away, then séeth the blossomes of Pomegranates in water, and gargarize there∣withall. To stay the blood, take the blossomes of Pomegranates, Frankinsence, Sang. Draconis, and Starch, of each one drag. blow this powder into his throte. Item take the blossomes and pils of Pomegranates, Sumach séeds, and Sang. Draconis, boile them in water, and gargarize there∣with. You may also blow the foresaid things into the throate, or boyle them in Wine and drinke it. Another. Take Garlick, Lupins, and Coloquint, of each one drag. Gith séeds halfe a dragme, Mustard séeds one drag. and a halfe; boile them all together in sixtéene ounces of vineger till the fourth part be consumed: then dissolue thrée drag. of Salarmoniack in it, and gargarize there∣with. But if the Leach be gone downe into the stomacke, then are you to vse the same remedies
that are prescribed against wormes, and there kill it. Or take meale of Lupins, Turbith, Stechas, Penniroyall, Gith, of each one quarter of an ounce, mixe it with the iuice of Wormewood, and make trociskes of it of the weight of a drag. of which dissolue one in thrée ounces of the decoction of Gith, and take it fasting. It is very forcible, but fafer and easier things may be vsed for it. Of the Squinancie or swelling in the throate. §. 4. THis Squinancie haue the learned giuen many kinds of names, and that of the place in the throate where it appeareth, or according to the qualitie and nature of it: as Angina, Cijnanche or Synanche, which last name the Phisitions haue al∣tered, naming the same Squinanchem or Squinantiam. And with all these names haue they meant but one sicknesse, to wit, a tumor in the throte; euen as they call Pleuritis the pleurisie. They describe the Squinancie thus: Angina is a strong perillous sicknes, that ariseth about the throte, in the mouth, and about the throte boll, and very quickly stoppeth the breath. Or Angina is a flegmaticke defluxion, that sinketh into the outward part of the throate, and there swelleth so that all the inward parts of the throate are thereby shut vp, and the breath hindered. The causes are diuers: for it is ingendred as wel through great heate, as through great cold, and also through sharpe Northerne winds; but especially when the same bloweth presently af∣ter a South wind: Likewise also if one sit bare headed in the Mooneshine a long time. But this sicknesse doth chiefly come and procéed of defluxions that fall out of the head into the throate, and there cause a swelling; and chiefly in the falling of the leafe or haruest, when the rheumes are most of all mingled with sharp Cholera; like as the same are in winter for the most part min∣gled with Phlegma. Sléeping also immediatly after meales with hanging of the head increaseth the same. Fat meate, and all that is drest with milke, Melons, and violent motions straight af∣ter meates, cause also this sicknes. The same do also denimous things, as blacke Hellebore, and all Toadstooles. So are sometimes blood, Cholera, Phlegma and Melancholia occasions of this sick∣nes, which neuerthelesse do seldome strangle a man. The signes of Angina are a short breath, with bad swallowing; otherwhiles blistering of the toong, so that the drinke taken wil be driuen out at the nose againe: the spéech goeth through the nose more or lesse, as the sicknes is of importance. If the blood be cause of it, then is the pulse strong, the face, eies and toong red, the mouth swéet, great paine and retaining of the breath. If it come of Cholera, then is there great heate with litle spettle, thirst, blistering, and drought of the toong, bitternes of the mouth, and great paine with it: the breath is not so short as of blood, the toong is yellowish: this is also augmented in haruest, and in summer, and if one be cholericke also. If this sicknes procéed of Phlegma, then is there too much tough moisture in the mouth, some∣times salt, and of an euill tast, the face is bleake and the toong also: then is but litle paine, little thirst, and a little tumor. But if it procéed of Melancholia, then is therewith sowernesse in the mouth, the swelling is hard, his face ashcoloured. Also this Squinancie commeth by litle and litle, and not so sudden as the other. Now to ease this disease, there is nothing better then to eate and drinke but little: the drinke shall be a Iulep of Roses tempered with Well water, or Sugar water, or any thing Meade. Further, he is to eate light meates, as bread mollified in fresh flesh broth, and such like. He shall also oftentimes two houres after meate take Pillulas Elephanginas, and let his head be offer combed and stroked. And let him gargarize with wine of Pomegranates and barly water min∣gled together. Afterwards he is to cleanse his mouth with sixe ounces of Barly water, wherein is tempered one ounce of the sirupe of the outward gréene nut shels. Before meate he is to vse water to wash his feete, wherein Woodbind, Bay leaues, Marioram gentle, and Rosemary are decocted, and he shall rub his legs downewards with these herbes. Also he is often to vse thrée  foure graines of Masticke, and one graine of Cucubes, or Lignum Aloes, to chew it in the mor∣ning, and to hold it in his mouth.
For this infirmity it is also very commodious for one to auoyd much filth through the nose. And as this Squinancy is caused diuersly, so do the learned also deuide the same into foure kinds: First, when the throate and the bulke, with the parts round about them, do swell: Se∣condly, if about the throate there be no swelling séene on the outside, notwithstanding aboue all this, that the breath is so short that one would thinke that the patient would be strangled: Thirdly, when there appeareth a swelling on the outside of the throate: Fourthly, when the throate swelleth as well within as without. But after what manner soeuer it commeth, it is alwayes a perillous sicknesse, and especially the second kind, for that it is very quick and spéedy, so that oftentimes it dispatcheth one in two or thrée dayes; and commonly it is more dangerous for children then for aged folke: therfore do the Latinists call this kind of Squinancy Strangulatorem, which is, Strangler, as it were some∣what that fell into the throate, the which then so stopt the breath, that one must therewith be strangled. For Strangulatio they say, is nought else but a spéedy death, by reason that one can get no breath, euen as it hapneth when the throte is stopt. And this is the difference betwéene them: the Squinancy (as it is said) killeth one very hastily: Peripneumonia (which is a sicknes of the lights) doth with a painful breath strangle by litle and litle. But if rheumes fall into the throte, then are they a cause of strangling, for that thereby the pipes of the lights in time are stopped. If in swallowing he feele a narrownesse and paine that the breath be painfully drawne, and that the patient haue scarcenes of breath, and is constrained to hold open his mouth, then is the Squinancy at hand, which is great or small, as may appeare by the vehemency of the signes. And for that this disease procéedeth as well of bloud, Cholera, and heate, as of cold and Phlegma, and so requireth speciall remedies, therefore we will hereafter in particular speake of them. Of the Squinancie or paine in the throate through heate. §. 5. FOr this Squinancy, regard is to be had to the face and the eyes, whether they be red, and the face puft vp, and whether the patients spettle be swéet: Also whether he (being healthy) hath vsed much nourishing meate and drinke, for when these signes (as is said) do appeare, then it is certaine that this Squinancy procéedeth of superfluous blood and heate, then is the head veine to be opened without all de∣lay on the right hand, and to let out foure or fiue ounces of blood, according to the ability of the person, and to vse this Clister by and by after it. Take Mallowes, Hollihocke roots, Violet leaues, Cammomill, Adiantum, of each a handfull, séeth these in sufficient water vnto the halfe part. Take 12. or 16. ounces of this decoction, oyle of Dill, and of Saffron, of each one ounce, oyle of Beuercod halfe an ounce, Hiera logodion one ounce, the iuice of Swines bread (if you can get it) one scruple, Diagridion halfe a scrup. salt one drag. minister it warme. If the sicknesse be somewhat tolerable, then within twelue houres af∣ter set two great boxing cups on the shoulders hard by the neck very warme, and let them bleed well. But if the patient be corpulent, then is the Median to be opened on the same side, or the litle veines vnder the toong. This letting of blood is not to be done at one time only, but if the pati∣ent may well abide it, shall be the oftener reiterated, and the lesse at once, for it dispatcheth and driueth the matter from them. But vntill the patient be let bloud, Clistered, and boxed, he must be rubbed with warme clothes, and first, from beneath the knées euen to the feete; afterwards, from the thighes to the knees; thirdly, from the shoulders vnto the huckle bone; fourthly, from the shoulders vnto the hands: or at the leastwise bind the same members hard, and make them loose often, as hath bene sayd. Then both before and after purging are presently to be vsed all cooling and astringent gar∣garismes, whereof diuers are described in the third Chapter and the fourth §. Or make it thus, Lay the seeds of Sumach to stéepe in Rice water, and gargarize therewith. Or take Coriander, Sumach, Gals, Hippocistis, Pomegranate pils, of each a like quantity, séeth these in sufficient water vntill the halfe be consumed. This following is also very good (being vsed within the first thrée dayes) Take the water of
Purslaine and Plantaine, of each foure ounces, sirupe of greene Nutshels thrée ounces, tempe∣red and holden long in the mouth. Item, to gargarize with warme milke easeth the paine. Take sirupe of Poppy heads, and sirupe of Mulberries, of each one drag. Rose water three ounces, tempered and vsed as the other before. Or take Barly water as much as you will, and mingle amongst it sirupe of Pomegranats, Mulberies, and hony of Roses as much as you will. Item take small sliced Licorice, Currans, Figs, Fleawort, Quince kernels, and white Poppy séed, of each one quarter of an ounce, barly one ounce and a halfe, séeth it in sufficient water till that the barly breake, put vnto it two ounces of the hony of Roses. This is very good to be vsed after the purging. Take Acornes that be old, beate them small, giue of them to the patient twice a day halfe a drag. at each time, in what you please. This is speciall good against the swelling of the throte: it is also good to take the fume of them into the throte. Item take dried white dogs dung, halfe an ounce beaten small, tempered with the sirupe of Mulberies, and giue it to the patient to swallow by litle & litle: it helpeth & drieth maruellously. What ought to be vsed outwardly. BEfore there be any salues, plaisters, or any other thing layd vpon the outside thereof, you are to froth and rub the patients armes and legs (euen as before is sayd) and annoint the same members afterwards with fresh butter, or with the oile of sweet Almonds. Or vse this following: Take the salue Dialthea one ounce and a halfe, muscilage of Fleawort and of Quince kernels, of each one quarter of an ounce, prepared Cassia & fresh butter, of each one drag. Leuen and Dates, of each half an ounce, oyle of Violets two ounces, and make a salue of them. Item take a Swallowes neast, and seeth it in Well water, straine the same through a nar∣row seeue, and in this water boyle the rootes of Lillies, Mallowes, Hollihockes, Violet leaues, Pellitory, Cammomill, Adiantum, of each one handfull: stampe them all together with Barly water and Linseed meale, of each one ounce, Cammomill two ounces, and thereof make a plaister. Another of Montagnana. Take a Swallowes neast, Mallowes and Hollihock rootes, of each one handfull, Cammomill, Adiantum, of each two handfuls, barly meale thrée ounces, oyle of Cammomill one ounce, and lay it warme on the throte. Afterwards if any impostume appéere, then take Figs, Fenegréeke, and Squils, of each halfe an ounce, séeth them together in a pint of water till but halfe remaine, temper it with thrée ounces of Oxymel, and then gargarize with it. And if you thinke that it be too mild, then open the swelling (if you can come to it) and wash the mouth often with wine and hony. For purging thereof. THis purging must be effected with coole things, as sower Dates, Prunes, Confections, Cassia and Manna (as shall seeme good:) also mild clisters are to be vsed, as hereafter fol∣loweth. Take Mallowes, Hollihock roots, Violet leaues and Orage, of each a handfull, of the séed of Melons, Cucumbers, Gourdes and Pompeons stamped grosse together, of each one drag. and a halfe: seeth them all together in sufficient water, take of this decoction 12. or 16. ounces, Cassia one ounce, salt one drag. minister it warme. Good héed is also to be taken, that the patient haue a soluble body; and to that end serue sup∣positories made of Venice sope, vsing the same oftentimes. If the same ach of the head be mixed with Cholera, the which may be knowne hereby, that is, if with the swelling there be a pricking and gnawing paine, yellow colour, bitternesse in the mouth: also if that he in time of health haue eaten such meates as augment Cholera, then is the sick body to be purged with the abouesaid things. Rubarbe is also very commodious for it, in this manner following: Take one ounce of Manna, Rubarbe one dragme or twaine, steepe them in sixe ounces of prune-broth sixe houres long; then straine it out hard: afterwards vse
the Clister which is described in the twelfth Chapter of the first part 5. §. for madnes or frenzie which beginneth thus, Take Lettice, &c. Hereupon you are to open the head veine on the hand, and set cups on the necke and shoul∣ders. Vse also these aforesaid gargarisms, or this following: Take the iuice of Nightshade that is well settled, sixe ounces, Roses, sliced Licorice and Fitches, of each halfe an ounce, good white wine thrée ounces, let it seeth méetly well; then temper it amongst one ounce and a halfe of Cassie, and gargarize therewith often. This helpeth and easeth the paine. In the increase of the sicknesse, there is sometimes vsed Myrrhe sodden with wine. In like manner also the muscilage of Barley tempered with Goates milke, Sugar, Nightshade, and a little Saffron. Thus may then the bad matter be drawne outwardly: Take Shéepes wooll dipped in oyle of Cammomill and Sallad oyle, and lay it vpon the sore. Or (if one can get it) take one quarter of an ounce of Snakes skins, which the Snakes do cast euery yeare, and seeth it in an ounce of oile of Almonds: then wet a cloth therein, and lay it on the place where the sore is a whole day and a night. This plaister following is to this end also much commended. Take Fenegréeke and Linséed meale, of each one quarter of an ounce, Hollihocke séedes, Cammomill, Hyssope, of each one handfull. These thrée last séeth, and stampe to pap, and then mingle it with the foresaid meale, and with two ounces of Cammomill oyle, and two ounces of the oyle of Lillies: afterwards seeth it all together vntill it be somewhat thicke, and then lay it warme on the necke. In like manner are highly commended the swallowes with their young ones, burnt in a pot to ashes, and the same blowne into the throate, or tempered with honie, and the throat an∣nointed therewith, or gargarized, which is a passing good remedie. But aboue all other is Oxymel with Rosewater and vineger in the beginning most commen∣ded. Likewise the sirupe of Mulberries and gréene Nut shels: so that the skilfull Phisitions do write, that those thrée last are the best remedies of all others. Prepare also these pilles to hold vnder the tongue: Take Assa foetida one drag. Ireos halfe an ounce, make them vp with the iuice of Colewoorts. If you thinke that the patient will be strangled and cannot swallow, then take Hemlocke séede, Radish séede, Assa foetida, Borras, Myrrhe, Ammoniacum, and common Salt, of each a like quantitie: of these altogether, or of some of these make a powder, and blow thereof into the throate. A great boxing cup (without pricking or otherwise) set behind in the necke, helpeth that the meate and drinke will be the easier swallowed downe. But in case that the impostume be broken, then are you often to gargarize with Meade and wine, wherin Sugar and Ireos be sodden. Iulep of Violets is very good for these kind of pains. Paine in the throate through Phlegma, and cold taking. §. 6. IF the face and the eyes be not red nor fierie, and that the patient haue his mouth alwaies full of spettle, and is hoarce without great paine, with other signes moe of Phlegma: then shall Treacle and Mithridate be vsed, for that they mitigate the pain, expell all swellings, and cleanse all exulcerations wonderfully. Further, you may vse this gargarisme following: Take Ireos halfe an ounce, Hyssop, Adiantum, of each one drag. Licorice, Currans, and Figs, of each one ounce, Fenegréek and Lineséede, of each half an ounce, Barley one ounce and a halfe, let it séeth together in sufficient water vntill the halfe be spent. Also you may make choise out of the last mentioned gargarismes in the 13. Chapter and 4. §. of that shall best like you, and that is speciall good which is prepared of the sirupe of Mulberries and sirupe of greene Nut shels, for a foule mouth: for both of these are specially commended for all paines of the throat, as daily experience teacheth. The roote of Diuels bit sodden in water, and therewith gargarized, doth maruellously ease the squinancie. For to purge are very requisite the pils Cochiae, Foetidae, de Hiera, and the powder Medicamen de Turbith, according as neede shall require. And if neede be, let a strong Clister be made and ministred, as you shall find in the twelfth Chapter and the 17. §. that which is very meete for this, which beginneth, Take Centorie, &c. There are Trocisces also vsed that are to be holden in the mouth, and are to be made and drest thus: Take Masticke, Frankinsence, Raisins, red Storax, and Nep, of each one quarter
of an ounce, beate them all to powder, and make trocisces thereof in waight halfe a drag. The auncient Phisitions did vse to take a gréene Elderne stick, to shaue from it the vttermost bark, and did take the gréene and yellow rind of it, and strewed them with wheate floure, and so held them in the mouth. They do warme and drie much. Outwardly you must annoint the necke with Sallad oyle, Cammomill oyle, and oyle of sweete Almonds, or with the ointment of Dialthaea, and washt Shéepes wooll laid vpon it, and afterwards the plaister before mentioned in the 5. §. with Cassia, or this that hereafter follow∣eth, for that there is small difference betwéene them both. Take the vnguent of Althaea one ounce and a halfe, the muscilage of Fenegréeke and Lin∣séede, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cassia, fresh Butter, of each one quarter of an ounce, sowre dough, and fat Dates one ounce, oyle of swéet Almonds two ounces, and thereof make a salue or plaister. Or take Wheate, Fenegréeke, and Lineséede meale, of each two ounces, water sixe ounces, oyle of Cammomill two ounces, séeth them till they be thicke enough, and afterwards spread it on a cloth, and lay it about his necke. Item, take Goose dung, and Swines bloud, of each a like quantitie, mingle them, and lay it fiue times in 24. houres about his necke. Some auncient Phisitions do counsell to take warme Hony of Anacardio, Mel Anacardium, and let the necke be annointed thicke cleane ouer, that blisters may be raised, whereby the mat∣ter might haue an issue foorth. Item, take white dogs dung (of a dog that eateth nothing but bones) Swallowes dung, or Wolfes dung, which you can get, beate them to powder, afterwards temper it with hony, and annoint the necke therewith. This may you make for a gargarisme, or blow into the throate with a pipe. If sudden strangling be feared, then are you to clip or shaue off as much haire from the top of his head, that a great boxing cup may be set thereon, which must be often fastened, and taken off againe. In greatest extremitie is woont to be made a vent in the patients throate betwéene the two gristles, that he through the same vent may take ayre and breath, the which vent afterwards when the swelling is gone, is to be cured as other wounds are. Of the Vlcers of the throate. §. 7. WHen as then the foresaid Squinancie or any other defluxion hath so annoyed the throate, that thereby the skinne is broken, and the throate exulcerated, then take Cypers nuts, Calmus, Sulfer viue, burnt Allume, Roses, Pomegranate pils, Masticke, Frankinsence, and Pieretrum, of each one drag. and twelue ounces of Aqua vitae, temper them all together and kéepe them for thy vse. Then in the time of neede, take a little thereof, and gargarize therewith, for it drieth, clean∣seth and healeth maruellous well. If this be too strong, then allay it with Plantaine water, Knotgrasse water, or Prunella water. For this purpose is also good a decoction of Guaiacum. In like manner also Aqua Iohannis, which is described in the twelfth Chapter of the first part and 5. §. But of all such things that do greatly hinder the same, you shall find good instructions her∣after in the beginning of the description of the stomacke. The second Chapter. Of all Rheumes and Defluxions in generall. THis Greeke word Rheuma, tearmed also in English a rheume, is nothing else but a defluxion which descendeth or falleth from the head into the throate or breast, which doth otherwhiles so stop there the pipes of the lights and throate, that the patient seemeth to strangle or choke. Also these Rheumes do often fall into the nostrels, where they cause the Pose, which is described in the second part the eight Chapter, and 6. §. And forasmuch as these kinds of Rheumes, according to their seuerall natures haue seue∣rall
names, as that which falleth into the nostrels is called Coryza: that which descendeth into the breast, Rheuma: that which commeth into the throate, Bronchus: Neuerthelesse, all tough and slymie defluxions which fall from one member into another, are called rheumes or deflu∣xions; for that they prouoke (as is sayd) not onely the strangling in the throate, but also are both noysome and troublesome vnto the breast; whereof we shall shortly write: therefore it is very requisite that we make mention of them at this present. First these rheumes do proceede of diuers causes, like as when the humours of the braine, through the same, through bathes, vaporing meates; as Onions, Garlicke, Mustard, Pepper, and such like, are made thin and fluxible. Secondly, these are caused of great cold, whereby the parts of the head be thrust and compel∣led togither, and the humors forcibly expelled; euen as water is wrong out of a spunge. In like manner may they be stirred vp of the superabundance of some humors, be it of Cholera or Phle∣ma, or of some other outward alterations, as of a sharpe Northerly wind, that bloweth sodain∣ly after a South wind. In fine, the plaisters that are neither too hot nor too cold, are auailable for all such defluxions; to wit, as followeth: Take Rosin two ounces, Laudanum halfe an ounce, Myrrhe, Masticke, of each half a dragme Sandaraca one quarter of an ounce, Beane meale, Pease meale, of each halfe an ounce; dissolue the Rosin and Laudanum in one ounce of lye, and let them séeth till they be ve∣ry soft: then put it into a mortar, & mixe the meale amongst it: Spread this warme vpon a cloth, and lay it vpon the whole head. If you will haue it harder then leaue out the meale, and tem∣per togither with the other one drag. and a half of Waxe. This comforteth the brains, stayeth the rheume, drieth all tough slime that falleth into the nostrels, mouth, and throate, and would choke one. For it is often found, that those that haue bene at the point of death, haue by this meanes bene recouered. Item take new Barley meale two ounces, Nigella séedes, Mustard séede, and Mice dung, of each one ounce, Oxe gals, or the vrine of a manchild, as much as sufficeth therewith to make a plaister. Or take fresh Bryonie rootes twelue ounces, Wormewood, Rosemary, Marioram, all gréene, of each a handfull and a halfe, Barley meale two ounces, Saffron one dragme, Scam∣mony halfe a dragme, oyle of Lillies thrée dragms: séeth well all the rootes in water, afterwards stampe them well to growt or pap amongst the other herbes, and therewith temper all the rest, except the Saffron which must be also added vnto them. Last of all spread thereof vpon a cloth, and then lay them all warme ouer all the polled head, couering the same warme. This is also commodious for all old headaches, especially for such as procéed of cold humors: for it consumeth all defluxions and bad vapors of the braines that fall out of the head into the eyes, eares, teeth, and throate: it is twice a day to be renewed. These two plaisters following are also highly commended to be very good for the same: first, put aboue vpon the head a meetly great boxe or cup vnpickt vpon the same, on the seame of the scul (the haire being cut off before) & the place that the cup is fastened vnto must be first wel rub∣bed, till it be red, and let the cup draw it well. Afterwards lay this plaister following thereon: Take Laudanum, Gummi Heleni, Sandaraca, Frankinsence, white and red Storax, and Rosin, of each a like much, melt the Laudanum, Rosin, and the liquid Storax togither, and temper the other with them: But if it be hard, then make it softer with oyle of Lillies plaisterwise. The second is more forcible than the first. Take Aloe, wild Mints, and Citron pils, of each a like much; mixe them togither with Laudanum in a warme mortar, with asmuch iuice of Sloes as will make it soft. Of Rheumes that proceede of cold. §. 1. THe cause of these rheumes are strong cold Northerne winds, and chiefly if there did blow before that, a mild moyst Southwest wind, as hath bene told already. Also to lie bareheaded in the nights when it is cold, whereby the moysture is for∣cibly driuen togither, and chiefly if warmth follow after, as hath bene heretofore shewed of the Spunge. Also moyst fruits do cause these distillations, as Cherries, Apples, Peares, Peaches, and such like. These Rheumes are knowen by these signes following: as wearinesse and heauines of the
whole bodie, sléepinesse, heauinesse of the head and forehead, palenes of the face, with full veins, stuffing of the head or nose, bereauing of the sense of smelling, swelling vp of the eyes, paine in the throat, motion to vomite, dropping of the nose, and swelling of the Almonds. In like manner is the head also in the féeling found cold, and the rheume is neither sharp nor biting at all. The which is commonly ingendred and maintained, if the complexion, the time, the age, and the weather be cold. As for example. If that any one do runne into the cold ayre bareheaded out of a bath, or after any other great warmth, especially in the nights, and begin to get a tickling in the nose, then is it a sure signe that he hath alreadie gotten a defluxion, and then must the patients head be co∣uered so long with warme clothes, that he féeleth manifestly that his head beginneth to warme inwardly, or in stead thereof he shall lay these things following vpon his head. Take beaten Millet foure ounces, Salt one ounce, parch them in a panne, and lay this vpon his head as hote as may be suffered. Or take a good quantitie of Salt, powre thereto as much Wine as is requisite to dissolue the same Salt, and being a little sodden, wet clothes therein, presse them out, and lay them very drie vpon his head, this drieth and is safe. You may also prepare this salue. Take Pigeons dung, wild Rue, Beuercod, and white Mustard séede, of each one drag. oyle of Rue thrée ounces, Euphorbium halfe a drag. Waxe as much as will suffice for a plaister, but let the forepart of the head be shorne, and the place annointed therewith where the sore is, it is forcible and dryeth much. Will you now haue more plaisters and salues for the same? then looke into the first part of the description of the cold paine of the head, for these things are also very commodious for this paine. Yet note this, that all that is here discoursed, is to be spéedily effected: for if this disease be to be maistered, the same must be done at the beginning, when as the patient is incontinently to haue a veine opened on the right hand betweene the thumb and the forefinger, letting out foure or fiue ounces of bloud. Clisters. AFter the full dispatch of letting of bloud, minister a Clister vnto him at night. Take Branne, Mallowes, rootes of blew Flower deluce, Beetes of each one handfull, seeth it all together in sufficient water, and then take of this decoction 12. or 16. ounces, con∣fection of Beuercod a drag. and a halfe, prepared Cassie and Tho. Sugar, of each fiue drag. oyle of Lillies and Cammomill, of each one ounce and a halfe, Salt one quarter of an ounce, mingle them all together, and minister it méetly warme. The next morning following giue these pils: take pils of Hiera composita two scruples, Cochiae one scruple, make seuen pils and vse them at one time. Against the euening let him be rubbed with rough warme clothes, euen as is said not long ago in the first Chapter and 5. §. of the paine of the throat. And this is to be obserued certaine dayes euery morning and euening. Gargarismes.If therefore these rheumes be cold, thin, and wateris, then can you not do better, than to make the same thicke, the which may be performed with Mastick, Frankinsence, Cypers nuts, and such like, if one do gargarize oftentimes therewith, or vse this following. Take Myrrhe, and Frankinsence, of each one ounce, Cypers nuts, Nutmegs, and Masticke, of each halfe an ounce, beate them all together, and boyle them in twelue ounces of red Wine vnto the half, and gargarize therewith. Cakes to be holden vnder the Tongue. TAke Masticke, Nutmegs, Cypers nuts, of each halfe a dragme, red Storax, and Fran∣kinsence, of each one dragme and a halfe, fat Raisins (the stones taken out) Sugarpane, of each one quarter of an ounce, make a dough therof with Meade, and then make Cakes thereof as big as small Beanes, the which you are to hold continually day and night vnder the tongue.
Syrupes and purgations. FOr a sirupe, Take Sage, Cypres leaues, of each one ounce, Lignum Aloes one quarter of an ounce, clarified hony and Sugar, of each sixe ounces, and let them séeth togither in a sirupe, as hath bene often taught. Another. It is also very needefull, that in such diseases the head be well purged, whereto this sirupe following serueth wel: Take Elecampane rootes, Ireos, Currans & Licorice, of each one ounce, Hyssope, Adiantum, of each a handfull, Masticke, Frankinsence, of each one dragme, Nut∣megs, Cypres nuts, of each half an ounce, séeth this togither (as is beforesayd) with Sugar, and giue him certaine dayes continually two ounces wich thrée ounces of this water. Take twenty Iuiubes, thirty Sebestes, Currans one ounce and a halfe, dried Violets halfe an ounce, cut Licorice fiue dragmes, and ten figs, seeth them all togither in a pinte and a halfe of water, vnto the halfe; afterwards straine it out, and let it settle. You haue also here before in the first part for the cold pain of the head, sirupes and other things that serue for these rheumes. For purging these pils following are speciall good, as Hiera Composita and Cochiae. Three dayes after purging, there is to be set aboue the buttockes two great boxing cups vn∣pickt, two howers before supper, and let them draw wel, and the next morning take of this con∣fection following the quantity of a Walnut: Take Ginger two ounces, Licorice one quarter of an ounce, Cloues Nutmegs, and Cardamom, of each one drag. and 18. ounces of refined white Sugar; temper them all togither one amongst another. Another, Take Cinnamome one dragme and a halfe, Nutmegs, red Storax, of each halfe a dragme, Licorice, Currans, of each one ounce, Sugar candie halfe an ounce, refined Sugar fiue ounces, make a confection thereof, and take halfe an ounce thereof euery euening when you go to to bed. The seuenth day after that the patient hath beene purged, he shall euery day two howers before meales, at noone and at night, twice euery moneth wash his mouth with water wherein Costus and Asarabacca, of each halfe an ounce is decocted. Take of this water fower ounces, of Oxymel Compositum two ounces, therewith shall he gargarize two dayes one after an∣other, till he haue washed it eight times. For this cold rheume is also speciall good the herbe Calmus, as it is described in the eight part of this booke. Thrée cornes of white Frankinsence swallowed downe before he go to bed are also commended: And if so be that the rheume be wa∣ren a little thicker, then is there no better aduice in the world: for it comforteth and drieth not onely the braines, but stoppeth the rheume also from falling. It is also good counsell after pur∣ging euery third or fourth day, three or foure howers before meales, that you take a dragme of Treacle or Mithridate, the which is better for aged than for yong folkes. Capitall Powder. AFter letting bloud, you are euery euening two howers after supper, to strew the head with this powder following: Take red Storax, Roses, burnt Iuorie, wild Vine leaues, Cloues, Sandaraca, of each one dragme, and make a powder thereof. Another for to smell on: Take Nigella that is parched on the sire, bind it in a cloth, and smell often thereto. Or take Lignum Aloes, red Storax, of each one dragme and a half. Nutmegs, Cy∣pers, Frankinsence and Cloues, of each one dragme, parched Nigella séedes one quarter of an ounce: stampe them all togither, and bind them in a cloth. The vapor or smell of Sugar is also good for the braines, and driueth away all cold rheumes. In this behalfe Pomanders may be made also, as followeth:Pomanders. Take Laudanum and Hore∣hound, of each half an ounce, Lignum Aloes, red Storax, of each one drag. and a halfe, Nutmegs, Cypers nuts, Frankinsence and Cloues, of each one drag. Amber halfe a drag. powne all small that is to be powned, & dissolue the Laudanum with Rose water in a warme mortar, and make therof a pomander. Another: Take one dragme of Laudanum, Lignum Aloes, red Storax, Fran∣kinsence, of each halfe a drag. Nigella, Cinnamom and Cloues, of each two scruples, Nutmegs, Cypers nuts & Sandaraca, of each one drag. Galliae Muscatae one drag. Myrrhe, Lauander spike, Masticke, Costus rootes, of each one scrup. Amber halfe a scrup, Muscus thrée graines: dissolue the Laudanum with a little Waxe, and temper the rest being powdred amongst it, forme therof
pomanders as big as you will haue them: afterwards make holes in them, and put into them the Muske and Amber mixed with a little Rose water. Such like pomanders shall you haue more hereafter in the sixt part. You may also make bags with all these foresaid compositions. For this disease some do counsell to néese, and some suppose it hurtfull: but if these things do helpe the patient, then I counsell that this néesing be omitted, that the braines and the head be not thereby disquieted. Plaisters. TAke Pigeon doung, Rue séedes, Mustard séede, Frankinsence, Masticke, Nigella, of each halfe an ounce, mingle these things with Oxymel of Squils, and then put the rest amongst it, spread it vpon leather, and lay this plaister on the top of the head. This plaister drieth the superfluous moisture of the head, and strengtheneth the same, and you may put thereto Ste∣chas, Rosemarie, Marioram gentle and Cloues. Of the Diet in these rheumes. EVery such patient must haue speciall care, that he neuer lye vpon his backe: for if the rheumes fall backwards, then is it to be feared that they will prouoke the crampe or pal∣sey, or might choke one. His dwelling place or chamber shall be prepared for drith and warmth, yea in sommer sea∣son also: for if he should vse moist things, then it will be the worse for him, and be in danger of the palsey. In fine, the greatest care of all must be, that his dwelling be frée from all moisture, and if the place be not so by nature, then take fire, and cast therein these things following, (or one alone) therewith to fume his chamber: to wit, Sandaraca, Laudanum, Rosin of both sorts, Frankin∣sence, red Storax, and such like. Make also a fire with Iuniper wood, Baytrée wood, Tamarisk wood, or with any thing of that nature: and the patient must be warme clothed, and haue a spe∣ciall regard to his head, and he shall weare alwaies on the breast a soft small cushion, filled with downe or Hares haire, or (which is better) with Squirrels haire, the which he is to kéep about him night and day. Concerning his meate and drinke, euery such patient must refraine from wine as much as is possible, and drinke onely Sugar water tempered with wine or iuice of Pomegranates, to wit, the sixt or seuenth part of it. So that nature finding no superfluitie of the meate, may the more easily worke vpon the moisture of the rheume, and therewithall consume it. Here is to be noted, that one ought not to eate vnlesse hunger vrge thereto: otherwise might one euill light vpon another, and the stomacke thereby be weakened. But when naturall hun∣ger commeth, then may he eate, yet euermore arise and cease with appetite, and auoide all su∣perfluitie, especially if he féele any distemperature in the stomacke, and drinke not before meat, vnlesse the meate before were passed thorough the stomacke, which happeneth at least eight howers after that it is taken. His bread shall be in winter and in the spring time wheaten bread with the bran: but in haruest and in sommer he may eate boulted bread. Also it were not hurtfull for him in case the same bind him not ouermuch, that alwaies after meate he eate a little bisket baked with Annis séede, in which bread (be it howsoeuer it will) is to be obserued, that it be baked light, rising or puft vp, and salted a little more then ordinarie, and that it be not aboue thrée dayes old. Concerning his flesh, all kinds are good for him, Veale, Kids flesh, young Mutton, and leane Porke, but not too much, nor too often. All old and fat flesh must he shun and forbeare. Of wild beasts, Bucks and Does flesh is best of all. Hares flesh, albeit it be somewhat melancholike, yet neuerthelesse because it drieth, is not very vnwholesome for him, yet chiefly if it be drest with Pepper, but he must forbeare Conies and Hedgehogs. It is also requisite to shew what parts of the beasts are most wholesome for this sicknesse: to wit, the stomacke, the hart; the skin, the sinewes, the milt, the intrailes, the brains, the lights and such like of the foresaid beasts, are hard of digesture, and their fat is windie. Other parts are much easier of digestion and warmth of nature: reasonable fat flesh is easie
to be digested, the wings or pinnions and the legs are good for him at noone, being sodden; and at night are good rosted: but fryed in a pan is not for his dyet. All fowles, as Capons, Cocks, and chiefly Hens, wild and tame Pigeons which are not fully feathered, and haue béen killed a day or twain before, and are well drest: these may he eate franke and fréely. Yong Peacocks, Geese & Ducks, shall he also refraine, or at least eate of them very seldome, and that rosted. Of all wild birds, these are good for him, Partridges, Fesants, and small birds; as also Stares, Finches, Nightingales, Larkes, Sparrowes, Snites, Dishwashers, and such like; by reason that all their flesh is much drying. Swallowes, Magpies, and Woodpigeons are not to be vsed: Quailes shall he also abstaine from, in regard they are hurtfull for the stomacke, and breed loathsomnesse. No kind of fish is to be vsed: but in case that he wil eate them, then let them be hard broiled; to wit, Roches, Pikes, Gugeons, Perches, and such like: and they will hurt the lesse if they be drest with Parsley and Mints: and they are alwayes better broyled or fried, than sodden and stued: also the salt fish is better than the fresh. The Eele, the Tench, and the Creuets are also forbidden. Likewise Milke and all that is drest therwith: but he may eate eare egs out of their shels, or poched; but hard egs are naught. Of all manner of Pottages, there is onely allowed of Panicum, red Pease, and Rice. The herbes that are commodious for this must be in operation drying and warming, as Sage, Fennell, Mints, wild Thyme, Rosemary, Marierom gentle, Basill Dill. Contrariwise he must forbeare Lettice, Endiue, Spinage, Cherries, and all that are cold and moyst. In like manner also Radish, Léekes, and Onions, (after what manner soeuer that they be drest) shall he forbeare. Rapes or Turneps haue much superfluous moisture, therefore are not to be vsed: but Oliues and Capers are good for him. He must auoid all cold and moyst fruits, parched Hasell nuts, Al∣monds, Figs, Raisins, Pinapple kernels: Pistacium may he vse without danger. All meates that are betwéene sower and swéete; in like manner that which is drest with Ginger, Annis seede, Fennell, Parsley, Saffron, Cinnamom, Nutmegs, and Mace, are very commodious for him; and the rather if they be swéetened with hony than with Sugar. Item a Sallad made of Parsley, Mints, wild Thyme, & Vineger, is very profitable for him. His best drinke is hony water or Meade, Cinnamom and Licorice wine, amongst which are to be tempered some of the foresayd waters: And if he will néedes drinke wine without mingling it at all with water, then is to be taken (as is said) a thinne and pleasant white Wine, the which ought to be drunken delayed with steeled water. Lastly is the patient after meales to vse somwhat that closeth the stomacke, that the vapors ascend not into the head; as prepared Coriander, toasted bread, rosted Quinces, or such as be confected with hony. In the morning fasting, to go or walke on foote, or to ride a horsebacke softly, is very commo∣dious for these Rheumes. And if the patient be not so strong, then may one vse in stead thereof to rub him with warme clothes, (euen as is oftentimes afore sayd) and after meales to kéepe himselfe quiet two or thrée howers. Of watching and sleeping. THis patient must wholly forbeare sléeping on the day time, vnles he be otherwise distem∣pered, and must forbeare it at the leastwise two howers after meate: first he must lay himselfe on the right side and then on the left side, and not on the backe; for how hurtfull the same is, hath bene shewed sufficiently before. The heate of the sunne and of the fire must he auoid, and forbeare lowd calling and speaking. And to conclude, touching these cold and stifling rheumes, we will tell how they are to be pre∣uented, the which may be effected through these meanes following. And for that this disease proceedeth of a cold and moyst stomacke and braines, all things (measurably warme and dry) are good for it, as these confections following. These Species, Diatrion piperion, Aromaticum Rosatum, of each halfe a drag. Mace one quarter of an ounce, Cinnamom one drag. and a halfe, Sugar three ounces, sirupe of Roses fiue ounces;
the Sugar and the sirupe séeth till they be méetly thicke; afterwards mixe the other spices a∣mongst them in a mortar: take euery day foure houres before meales, as much as a Nutmeg. And this must you continue a moneth together, and afterwards three times a weeke, as long as you please. Or make this confection to be vsed after meate, and take thereof thrée dragmes at one time: Take Species Dimbrae, de xylo Aloe, of each one drag. and a half, Violets, Water Lillies, Sorrel seedes, and Endiue seedes, of each one scrup. Sugar foure ounces, seeth it in water of Violets, and make Manus Christi of them. A plaister for the stomacke. TAke Laudanum and Rosin, of each fiue drag. prepared Corall and Yuorie, small Endiue seede and Purslaine seede, of each one scrup. The two first you shall dissolue in sharpe vi∣neger, and put thereto molten waxe as much as is néedfull, and thereof make a plaister or twaine for the stomacke, and weare them all the winter vpon it. When these rheumes are a diuiding, then must you prepare a drie bath, as hereafter fol∣loweth. Take a sweating tub, make it méetly wet with wine and Rosewater, afterwards haile the same ouer a glowing fire till that it be through drie: then make the same wet againe with a sponge or cloth, as before: and do this so long, vntill that the tub be through hot; and then set the patient therein, and couer the tub ouer with clothes, which must stay vpon the hoopes, yet holding his head without: and let him sit so sweating one houre or twaine. Hote Rheumes. §. 2. AS in the beginning is generally treated of rheumes, so are there also declared certaine causes of the hote rheume, therefore it is néedlesse to rehearse the same again. These rheumes are much prouoked through idlenesse, through sléeping a daies, through superfluous eating and drinking. Also if the head be too hot co∣uered, great labour, ouerheating of himselfe, and such like. The signes and tokens that one hath the rheume, are these: to wit, the face is red, mixt with bleaknesse or pale colour, great heate in the nose, with itchings, when as the mouth and the throate are full of bitternesse and sharpnesse. And if the head be hote in feeling: the which rheume is thus to be cured. First, it hath not bene a little disputed of amongst the learned, whether a veine must be ope∣ned or not; but for the most part they affirme it: some would open the head veine, other the me∣dian, and some the Liuer veine. But this letting of bloud must be effected, according as the rheume falleth more on the one side than the other, and when the rheume is almost stayed. For it hath bene often seene, that they that haue bene let bloud in the beginning of the rheume, haue alwaies remained and bene the hotter. But to diminish all such subtill courses of the rheume, and to make it thicke, then must he hold in his mouth these gargarismes and losinges. Of Gargarismes. TAke sirupe of Iuiubes, of Violets and Poppie séeds, of each a like much, temper them with Barley water: Or take Iuiubes, Sebestes, Violets, white Poppie séedes, and Quince ker∣nels decocted with Barley water, vse it in the euening after meate; it is passing good. Item, take sirupe of Poppie seedes, sirupe of Mulberries, of Roses, and Well water, of each thrée ounces, wine of Pomegranates one ounce, make it warme, and gargle therewith. Losinges. TAke white Poppie seeds, Purslaine seed, and Lettice seedes, of each one dragme, Draga∣gant, Gummi Arabicum and Saffron, of each halfe a drag. Opium fiue graines: powne all that is to be powned, and make it with the sirupe of Poppie heades to a dow, then make losinges thereof as big as small beanes, and hold one of these in thy mouth. And for this also are commodious these common losinges, Diapapauer, and the cold Diatragacantha.
Item, take Gummi Arabicum, Dragagant, Starch, Licorice, Quince kernels, and séedes of Fleawoort, beate all these small together, make thereof as aforesaid losinges with the muscilage of Fleawoort, and hold them vnder thy toung. Also there may otherwhiles be made for a change the small losinges, called Bechion, of Dia∣chodion, Diamargariton, and all the sorts of losinges, which are here worthy to be described. The preparation of the losinges for the cough and rheume after diuers manners. THe blacke losinges are called at the Apothecaries, Bichion, or Bechion, the which are made after two sorts; to wit, as followeth: Take the iuice of Licorice, and Sugar, of each half an ounce, Starch, Dragagant, pilled Almonds, of each one quarter of an ounce, the Mus∣cilage of Quince kernels, as much as is néedfull for to make losinges with it: these do thicken al subtill rheumes, and delay their sharpnesse. Another sort: Take Pine apple kernels that haue bene stéeped a whole night in Rosewater, and bitter Almonds pilled, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, iuice of Licorice two ounces, bea∣ten Licorice three drag. make a dow with Rosewater, and then make thereof losinges: they are very good against the Cough, and against all raw swellings of the throate. The white losinges are thus prepared: Take white Sugar, and Sugar candie, of each a like, Starch the fourth part, beate them all together, and with Dragagant dissolued in Rose water, make losinges of them. Item, take sixe ounces of white Sugar, Sugar candie, and Sugar pennets, of each two oun∣ces, beaten Ireos thrée quarters of an ounce, Starch almost fiue drag. beate these all together with Dragagant dissolued in Rosewater, and make losinges of them. The third manner is this: Take Sugar pennets one ounce, Sugar candie thrée quarters of an ounce, Manus Christi without pearles and with Rose water, halfe an ounce, fine Bolus one drag. and a halfe, white Sugar one ounce and a quarter; make losinges thereof with Dra∣gagant as aforesaid. If that then neede require that these rheumes must be yet more suppressed and made thicker, then take Starch, Dragagant, pilled Almonds, Beane meale, blacke and white Poppy séede, Gum, and fine Bolus, of each a like much: this must you beate together with the muscilage of Fleawoort or Quinces; and make losinges thereof. For to Purge. NEcessitie also requireth in this sicknesse for to purge:Decoctio pecto∣rales. the which is to be begun with the sirupe of Iuiubes and Sebestes, or with the drinke at the Apothecaries called Decoctio pe∣ctoralis, the which is thus prepared: Take Burrage, Buglosse, Violet flowers, of each one drag. Iuiubes and Sebestes, of each fifteene, Venus haire, Scabious, Folefoote leaues, of each a handfull, Annis seedes two ounces, Figs and Dates, of each fiue, Licorice cut smal three drag. husked Barley halfe a handfull: let all these seeth together in a pint and a halfe of water vntill the third part be sodden away, straine it, and take the clearest of it, and keepe it in a coole place. Take small cut Licorice one ounce, Iuiubes and Sebestes, of each ten, seeth them all toge∣ther in sufficient water, and make it as abouesaid. In this manner are there many moe made: but these are the commonest. For purging, take three or foure ounces of the first mentioned decoction, breake therin Cassia and Manna, of each one ounce, mingle them together, and drink it warme, and you may drink a good draught of the two foresaid pectorall decoctions. Another purgation. Take Violets and water Lillies, of each one quarter of an ounce, Da∣maske Prunes ten or twelue, sower Dates one ounce, seeth them all together in eight or tenne ounces of water till the halfe part be consumed: you are to take three or foure ounces of this decoction: temper therein one ounce of new Cassia, confection of Succo Rosarum, or conserues of Prunes three dragmes, mingle them, and giue them early in the morning. The third purgation. Take foure ounces of broth wherein Prunes are sodden, steepe there∣in a quarter of an ounce of grosse beaten Rubarbe all night, and in the morning straine them,
and temper therewith two ounces of the sirupe of Roses, and giue it fasting in the morning, in the sommer cold, and in winter warme. But if you had rather haue pils, then prepare them thus: Take the shales of yellow Miro∣balans halfe an ounce, Rubarbe one ounce, Aloe, Diagridion, of each fiue drag. Masticke and Li∣corice of each one scrup. beate them all together with the muscilage of Quinces vnto a masse: you are to take thereof a dragme at once. After Purging. HAue regard whether the matter be yet waterie and thin, then are you to giue to the sick bodie somewhat that is made with Poppie séeds. For this is also good cold losinges of Dragagant, conserue of Roses and water Lillies, also he must smell to things that are cold of nature, as Rosewater (the which he must also draw vp into the nose) Camfere, Roses, Saunders, Pomanders of cold natures, whereof some are described in the sixt part. But if the rheume be tough and thicke, then is all that to be forborne that is made of Poppey heads, and make this water following: Take dried Hyssope, Licorice, Venus haire, Figs, Hollihock séeds, and séedes of Mallowes, of each a like much, and he shall hold in his mouth Dragagant with a little loch de Pino. Because these salt rheumes haue some communion with the liuer, then is highly commen∣ded for this, strange bathes, that flow from iron or other mines in the ground. When this patient will go to bed, then is he to take a quarter or halfe an ounce of the con∣serues of water Lillies, and vse also one of these two capitall powders following: Take Mace one quarter of an ounce, red Corall, burnt Iuorie, red and white Saunders, of each one scrup. Sandaraca one quarter of an ounce, water Lillies one drag. and a half, Cloues halfe a drag. tem∣per them together being all beaten small, and therewith bestrew the crowne of the head, and euery other day when you will strew other powder thereon, brush off the first. This following is more cooling: Take Roses, Myrtle séede or leaues, Corall, and Butchers broome séedes, of each a like much. This being powdred small, vse it as before. The order of Diet. THe best meate that this patient may vse (when he is not ouerweake) are paps of Barley, of Spelt, of Starch, of Oten meale, and alwaies adde some Sugar pennets. In like man∣ner may he eate these hearbes following drest or sod with other meates: as Spinage, Orage, Purslaine, Mallowes, and Béetes, also Melons, Gourds, Cucumbers. But if he be weake, then is he to eate Kids, Hens, and such like sodden with these foresaid hearbs and mild∣ly salted, reare egges, Oyle of swéet Almonds, and all small birds are very méete. The best that he may vse for drinke is Barly water, or Sugar water, and both hauing Li∣corice sodden in them. Item cleane fresh Well water tempered with sirupe of Roses or Violets. He must wholy forbeare wine: but if that will not be, then must he vse a thin wine tempered with a little veriuice. It is also good counsell for all rheumaticke persons to sléepe as little as is possible, and that with the head vpright. The which together with the whole bodie must be well couered, and in the meane whiles if any sweat follow, he must let the same haue his course. It is also thought good, that the forehead, the temples, and the whole brest be annointed with oyle of Violets, water Lillies and Roses, mingled together, or with each a part: Or that his breast be annointed with oyle of swéet Almonds and fresh Butter. When as the sicknesse is de∣clining, then is the patients head to be washed (if euer he vsed the same) with cleare lye, wherin is decocted or stéeped Marioram gentle, Roses, Cammomill, and Melilot, and afterwards he is to be combed, and dried with warme clothes. Of Rheumes with agues. §. 3. IF in case that through the foresaid remedies the rheume will not be stayed, which happeneth often through the aboundance of humours, then befalleth oftentimes a cough and ague to follow it, whereby one may well guesse, that the same procéedeth of a cholericke humor, that lyeth still hidden in the veines. Therefore is the letting
of bloud very néedfull for this, and especially in the liuer veine. Afterwards you must purge the bodie with Cassia and Manna, or concerning the same take the counsell of a learned Phisition. For this also must continually be vsed those Losinges wherein is no Ireos. And for to take away this hurtfull matter of the rheume, it is specially aduised, that the same be deriued from the brest into the nose where the same may be the better euacuated. To this end, take Ammoniacum halfe an ounce, small beaten Pellitorie of Spaine one quar∣ter of an ounce, make this with the iuice of blew Flower deluce into dow, and thereof take a little on a knife, and put it in the nose, and foorthwith you shall sée the water to run out of the nose. This is a secret. Item, take the iuice of the roote of blew Flower deluce one ounce, beaten Stauesacre and Pieretrum, of each one drag: make some cotton moist herein, and so put it warm into his nose. He must also be preuented and kept from eating of flesh, and drinking of wine as long as the ague and the cough endure. Barly water tempered with Iulep of Violets and sirupe of Vio∣lets must be his drinke: for this suppleth, moistneth, and cooleth the breast, and maketh the mat∣ter thicker. But if it procéede of cold, then are you to boile Venus haire, Hyssope, and Licorice amongst them. When as then the ague and cough begin to cease (which one may féele as the drouth and spettle beginneth to cease) then are you to prepare this water following: Take fiue fat Figs, ten Iuiubes, twenty Sebestes, Raisins (the stones taken out) one ounce and a quarter, Licorice cut small fiue drag. let them séeth well together in sufficient water. Afterwards straine it, and take thereof thrée ounces, sirupe of Violets fiue drag. temper them all together, and you shall giue him this potion, if the rheume procéede of heate: but if it procéed of cold, and the flegme or spettle will not be loosed, then seeth Venus haire and Currans with the foresaid things, and leaue out the sirupe of Violets. If the Rheume would not passe through the nose. §. 4. TO conclude, we are to adde this following to the rest. If so be this rheume do stop the nose a great while, and that there is no heate with it, then are fumes to be vsed for it. And héede is to be taken, that if the moisture that issueth out at the nose be subtill, sharpe or yellow: make a smoake with a little Sulphur, that hath bene stéeped in a little vineger, and is dried againe, or with husked Barley or Beans péeled, that were also stéeped in vineger and are dried againe, and beaten to powder. For this also serueth Saunders, and the Fume of Sugar. Or you may pre∣pare this following: Take grosse beaten brimstone one quarter of an ounce, séeth it in 8. ounces of red vineger, and receiue the vapor of into your nose. Or sprinkle the Sulphur with wine, and lay it on a hote stone. Item, make a vapor of sodden Barley, water Lillies, and white Poppie séede. Also you may sprinkle vineger alone vpon an hot iron. For this is also good the vapor or smoke of Partriges feathers. But if there be no heate nor rednes in the face, then make a fume of Costus roots and Frankinsence. Or take Gith séedes steeped in wine, and so sprinkle it on a hote stone. Take also Lignum Aloes, Mastick and Frankinsence, of each a like much being powned together, and re∣ceiue the vapor thereof. Likewise is commodious for this, Sandaraca stéeped in vineger, and the same sprinkled on a hote stone, and the vapor thereof receiued into the nose. And for as much as there is very much written at this present of this rheume, and shall be more discouered thereof in the description of the rheume, of the cough, and pursiuenesse: therfore will we here make an end of this Chapter. The third Chapter. Of the formost part of the Breast, Thorax. THat which we generally call the Breast, hath his beginning there where the necke endeth, downewards vnto the lower rib; albeit that Aristotle ascribeth the whole bodie from beneath vnder the necke without the armes, euen to the priuities below, vnto it: yet this Thorax includeth the foremost and hindmost part of the bodie, from the necke euen to the midriffe. The foremost part is in the
middle of it downwards, somewhat lower and heightened againe where the breasts or paps are; euen so in the hinder part downe along the backe bone it is lower, and on both the sides higher towards the shoulder blades and ribs. This place is not altogether bonie like to the scul, nor of one péece, but very orderly the one with the other intermingled, & filled with bones and muscles: so that the ribs comprehend and defend behind and before the inward parts, euen as it were with a bulwork. And euen as this part of mans body is outwardly defended with bones: euen so are also the inner parts with veines, arteries, and strong sinewes ioyned together, and fashioned very formally, thereby to take aire into it, and to yéeld it out againe, wherby the hart the lights, and other parts should be refreshed, and preserued in their estate. Also the brest (like as other parts of man) is subiect to many kinds of maladies: as partly may be séene in the description of the rheume. For when these mischieuous rheumes fall vpon the brest, then do they harme the lights, stop the wind pipes, make a man pursiue, stinking brea∣thed, much coughing, and anguish: so that at the last they rid matter and filth, with many moe such accidents, whereby the lights are perished and hurt, whereof afterwards more at large and plainely shall be parcelwise discouered. And to follow our woonted method, we will first speake of the outward parts of the Breast. Of womens breasts, milke, and of their diseases. §. 1. THe womens breasts are by nature indued with two kinds of wondrous works: The first, that through their meanes the new borne child receiueth his food, to wit, from the bloud, which through naturall warmth is altered and brought into milke. The second, that they are a defence & couer of the hart, whereby when they warme them, they are also in like manner kept warme of the said hart. Euen as our bodie warmeth the clothes, so do the clothes also kéepe the bodie warme. And this commeth more to passe in women than in men, by reason that their breasts are bigger by ods. The sub∣stance of womens breasts is a soft flesh, by nature spongeous, thereby to draw much moisture vnto it. Contrariwise, mens brests are hard and clung together, especially in them that are not ouercharged with fatnesse: both of them haue their nipples in the midst of their breasts: The which in women are very méet & comely instruments for to giue their new borne children their said sustenance.Mans milke. Otherwhiles also mens brests do giue milke: but this is a token rather of vna∣ble humors than otherwise. Thus to procéed with womens brests, they are subiect to diuers and sundrie accidents. Otherwhiles they grow a great deale too big, the which séemeth not onely ill, but is also sometimes an occasion of other diseases. But this commeth rather by nature or inhe∣ritance, and according to that one woman is fatter and corpulenter of bodie than another. But by nature (as it hath bene said) they are vessels of milke, whereby in some women it is too litle, and in some too much. Therefore it is very néedfull to séeke a remedie, how in the one to lessen them, and in the other to augment them. For where milke is too aboundant, there prouoketh it many kinds of diseases, to wit, that it doth clod and congeale in the breast, whereof hardnesse, heate, swellings, canker, woormes, and such like do ensue. In like manner the nipples do also chop, which bringeth thereby great anguish to them that giue sucke, and infect the children that sucke the matter and bloud into their bodies, with sun∣drie sicknesses. Of the ouermuch growing and hanging downe of the Brests. §. 2. WHen as this superfluous and ouermuch growing of the brests hapneth in hail, young and plethoricall women, there shall (in my best opinion) the nature be suffered to haue her free course, least by taking them away, some greater mishap be procured: yet some do counsell for a sure remedie, that if one annoint the breast with the gall of a Hare, that then they will not grow too great. Item, take Barley meale, and Goates milke, of each a like much, vineger halfe so much, let them séeth well, and be laid on the breast: it is taken for a certaine remedie: in like manner frie Mallowes in Sallad oyle, and lay it ouer the breast. These things following are yet stronger: Take Hypocistis, the pils and blossomes of Pome∣granates,
Acorne cups, and burnt lead, of each thrée drag. Allume, Ceruse, the iuice of Sloes, and rosted Lentils, of each one drag. Snailes with their houses burnt, and Southernwood, of each two drag. and a halfe: Make a salue thereof with the iuice of Plantaine, and therwith an∣noint the brest. Item, take Frankinsence, Masticke, of each one ounce, sea Muscles one drag. and a halfe, temper them together with red vineger. All that is taught here doth not hinder onely the growing of the Breasts, but also that they be not loose or hanging downe: these things may also be vsed against the falling downe of the Mother, euen as in the third part shall be further declared, in the description of the diseases of the wombe or mother. Pilles. TAke Ferne rootes, Sarcocolla, and Allume, of each one drag. Sandaraca halfe a drag. make fiue pils thereof with the iuice of Ireos, whereof take one, and fast foure houres after it. These pils do not onely consume all superfluitie, but also the naturall fatnesse of mans bodie, if they be oftentimes vsed. Secondly, he or she may (if they will) strew beaten Amber vpon all their meate: and if you will haue it work better, put the powder in wine; for the wine carieth the force of it very quick∣ly into the veines. Thirdly, take beaten Gals, Cypers nuts, of each sixe ounces, Allume prepared, Iron drosse, of each thrée ounces, séeth them together in a good deale of Tanners lie, and wash therewith méetely warme, and make often wet therewith the hands, féet, face, and breast with a sponge. The like are you to do also on the priuie members: Or take stamped Henbane séede, seeth it in wine, and then lay the wine ouer the Breasts. But I cannot counsell you to take this by rea∣son of his great cold. Of Milke in generall. §. 3. FOrasmuch as this wonderfull alteration of the red bloud into so faire & white a colour, daily happeneth in women and also in beastes, therefore is their force and might accounted the lesse: neuerthelesse hath God ordained it for all crea∣tures that are borne aliue, for their first and most requisite nourishment. Of the difference of women and beasts Milke, it is not our meaning here to dis∣course: but concerning womens Milke, the yellow is alwayes better than the white; so is also the same more forcible in browne women then in white. In Ponto by the Ri∣uer Astaeo it is sayd that milke in women & in beasts is black. But without any circumstances, we will onely discourse of the Breasts of women, and of the accidents incident vnto them. Of the want or scarcitie of Milke. §. 4. IF women that giue sucke haue want of Milke, then must we search out the cause thereof: This may procéed somtimes of some hote or drie, or of some cold qualitie of the Breast, that the bloud which shold alter into Milke, be dryed out. Likewise both these infirmities may also be cause of some infection of the liuer, yea and sometimes of the whole bodie; that if their complexion be too drie that then the increasing of Milke is not to be effected, but of pure bloud. Item, the want of Milke may also be caused through want of meate, or by the vse of such meates as make much bloud: as if they be cold and drie. Much bléeding (be it by what meanes soeuer it will) and the bad digesture of the stomacke and Liuer, sore labour, or if the child sucke too little, may be a cause of the want or scarcitie of Milke. The signes of this infirmitie are euident and apparant: as when the Breasts are wrong, and the Milke doth not issue foorth. Also if the child haue not enough to sucke. Item, whensoe∣uer that the mother which giueth sucke be fretting by nature, be leane, be not long since recoue∣red of some long sicknes, sweateth much, and is without all exercise. But if the infirmitie do procéede of bad meates and drinkes, it is then good counsell that they do eate good wholesome meate, that is light of digesture, as Hens, Partridges, Capons, young Mutton, Egs, brothes
of good flesh, and drinke good wine: Some women are accustomed to increase their milke, that they drinke a good draught of milke wherein Fennell séede hath bene stéeped. But if the infirmitie be through too much bléeding, by what means soeuer that the same come to passe, then are you to preuent the same through méete and necessarie remedies, as is suffici∣ently shewed in their proper places. But if the women be of a hot nature, as full of Cholera, then are they to drinke Barley water, and Almond milke, and to eate Cocks, Hens, and Partriges drest with Lettice: also to vse coole fruits and their séeds; fish of running waters, Burrage, Spi∣nage, Goates milke, Cow milke, Kids flesh, and Lambe sodden with veriuice: they are also to refraine from wrath and sorrow, and to be alwaies merrie. But if these mothers that doe giue sucke, be flegmaticke of nature, and haue lacke of Milk, then is their foresaid meate to be drest with Saffron, Cucubes, or Cinnamome, and other spices: also to eate it being sodden with Fennell rootes and seedes, Pistacia, and Pine apple ker∣nels. Whether the maladie do then procéed of heate or not, it is alway néedefull that the stomacke be comforted: for the which these things may serue, as Annis and Fennell feedes confected; but chiefly Caraway and Comin also confected. To eate Fennell séede gréene, helpeth also greatly for the augmentation of milke. Likewise Caraway séede, Annis and Fennell séede sodden in water, are very commodious for this purpose: also to eate gréene Marioram fasting in the mor∣ning is much commended for the same. And I cannot here pretermit to rehearse diuerse other remedies moe, that are prescribed of others for the increasing of milke, like as hereafter may appeare: Take tenne earth woormes, wash them in Wine, séeth them in flesh broth, straine them, and in the morning giue thereof a draught to drinke. It is also holden for certaine, that if these Wormes be dried and beaten to powder, and if you giue to the patient halfe a dragme to drinke in flesh broth, that thereby the milke will be much increased. For this also you may take this Plaister following: Take Parsley rootes, and the hearbes, Déeres sewet, of each halfe an ounce, red Storax thrée dragmes, new oyle of swéete Almonds thrée ounces, Barley meale one ounce and a halfe; let the rootes séeth well, and stampe them to pap, and then mingle the rest amongst it, and lay it warme vpon the Nipples, for it increaseth the milke. Item, take beaten Annis séedes two dragmes and a halfe, temper them with the broth of Colewoorts, and giue it to the partie to drinke when she goeth to bed. Item, take Barley wa∣ter, séeth therein gréene Fennell and Dill, make it swéet with Sugar, and drinke thereof at your pleasure. The like doth Linséede sodden in the broth of fresh meat and drunken. Some beléeue, that if a woman do drinke a dragme of fine powdered Christall with Hony or Barley water, that ther∣by the milke will maruellously increase. Some impute the like operation to be in the prepared Saphire stone, if the same be tempered with water, and the breasts wetted therwith. I account neither of them good: but they that will may trie them, for the cannot be hurtfull. Against the superfluitie of Milke. §. 5. IT commeth oftentimes to passe when women haue lien in, that their Breasts doe happen to swell through the aboundance of milke, and do bring mo inconueniences with them; namely, that sometimes the whole bodie thereby wasteth: for the grea∣ter abundance there is of milke, so much the more bloud is thereby consumed: if it be not suckt out, then doth it clod and cougeale, hardneth and turneth at the last with great paine into an impostume. The causes herof are superfluous bloud, much eating and drinking, and especially such kinds of meates as ingender bloud. Therefore must the same be in the beginning preuented, and those kinds of meates refrained; and to eate and drinke but little. And in case there be much super∣fluous bloud, then in the mother veine to be opened, that therby the bloud may be drawn down∣wards. Otherwise, there be two meanes to take away this superfluous bloud: The first meane is through the vse of Rue, and chiefly of wild Rue with their séeds, Basil and Comin stampt to∣gether, if one take of them euery day one quarter of an ounce, the same drieth the milke.
The herbe Rapistrum is very forcible for the same, the which may appeare in Swine: for when they eate of this herbe, then are they rid and quit of all their milke, whereby the Pigges are constrained to sterue. You may also lay these hot things on their Breasts. But these follow∣ing are more sure: Take Rosin as much as you thinke good, temper it with the Creame of milk, spread it on a cloth, and lay it lukewarme ouer the Breasts. Item, take eight ounces of Hony, and two pints of water, let them séeth well together, and scum it well, and then wet therein a thréefolded cloth, and lay in on the breasts; and when it is cold, take another: this driueth away the Milke. Item take Chickwéede, let it séeth in Goates milke, or in water, lay it ouer the Breasts. Also the water of Knotgrasse or Venice sope water, are both very good, vsed as before. Item take one drag. of Saffron, eight ounces of Malmsey, wet a cloth therein, and lay it on the Breasts, as aforesaid. Item, take gréene garden Mints, stampe them and mixe them with oyle of Roses, and do as before. And for this purpose is the oyle of Mints also very good. Item, take Beane meale mingled with vineger, and sodden to a pap or grout, tempered with oyle oyle of Roses to a plaister, and lay it on the Breasts. Take Beane meale foure ounces, oyle of Roses and red vineger as much as néedeth for to make a plaister. Or Beane meale and of Lentils, of each two ounces, Saffron one quarter of an ounce, oyle of Roses as much as is néedefull: all which foresayd things do drie vp the milke. For the clotted or congealed Milke in the Breasts. §. 6. THis congealing of the Milke in the breasts may procéede as well of heate, as of cold: Or that the Milke is too grosse, and cannot haue passage through the veines into the Breasts, or cannot be sufficiently sucked out, and there con∣gealeth, hardeneth, putrifieth, and impostumateth. The tokens thereof are manifest, as hardening, inflammation, and paine in that place where the milke is congealed, that if one do draw or wring the Breast, yet doth it giue no Milke at all. To preuent therefore this congelation, women must kéepe themselues very sober in eating and drinking, vse moist meates that may make subtill milke. For this is requisite, Mintes, Parsly, Saffron, and Cinnamome in their meates, and their drinke must be neate white wine, and vse commonly this following for the congealed milke. Take grated white bread as much as you will, new milke, and oyle of Roses, of each a like much, for to make pap thereof; let these séeth together, and lay it warme vpon the breasts; it dissolueth knots and swellings that procéede of congealed milke. Item, if the milke do paine any bodie, then take Corke, kindle it well, and then powne it to powder, temper it with oile of Roses and a little Vineger, and therewith annoint the breasts. Or take of the fat of a Kid one ounce and a halfe, liquid Styrax one ounce, Wormewood one ounce and a halfe, Comin and Dill séedes, of each one drag. Annis séedes halfe a drag. Barley meale halfe an ounce, oyle of Wormwood one ounce and a halfe; temper the rest amongst it being beaten small; and lastly put a little Saffron to it, and vse it as aforesaid. This salue following is very good for to dissolue the congealed milke: Take Déeres sewet thrée quarters of an ounce, liquid Styrax one ounce, Wormwood, Comin, and Dill seedes, of each one ounce, oyle of Wormwood, Duckes grease, of each one ounce and a halfe: make an oyntment or plaister thereof, and at the last adde a scruple of Saffron to it. If this congealing of milke be with an inflammation, and that it were néedfull to coole more: then mixe the muscilage of Fleawoort, of Fenegréeke, and Purslaine séedes together, of each a like much: make of them with molten Waxe an ointment, and therewith annoint the Breasts. Item, take Chickwéede without brusing it, apply it warme to the Breasts. Item take the iuice of Colewoorts, of Nightshade, and of Coriander, of each a like quantitie: This being mingled together, lay it with a cloth warme vpon the Breasts. Also beate Rose vineger and oyle of Ro∣ses together, vse it as before. Likewise Colewoort leaues or their iuice mixed with Saffron ea∣seth the paine. Take Fenegréeke meale, and make a plaister of it with oile of Violets and Vi∣neger.
But if the Milke be augmented by extreme cold, then take water and wine togither, and lay it on the Breasts. Or boyle Cammomill, Melilot, Fennell séedes, Annis séedes, Dill séedes, Fene∣greeke, Linséedes, Southernwood, Ginger and Basill, which you will, and vse it as hath bin said, especially if there be not an Ague with it. That which is sodden mayest thou beate, and with the oyle of Cammomill make a plaister of it, and so apply it. The Beuercod and his oyle is ve∣ry good for the same purpose. And especiall good plaister. Take the crums of white bread, Barley meale, Mustard séedes, Fennell, and Hollihocke rootes rosted vnder the ashes, of each a like much, powne them well togither, and with the oyle of Cammomill, make a plaister of them, and apply it warme on the Breasts: it softeneth the hard knots, dissolueth them, and suffereth them not to congeale againe. Item take Mints, and make a plaister thereof with white bread and Vineger. But if so be that this congealing grow to an impostume, then make the Breast moyst againe (as is already declared) with warme wine & water, also with the foresayd pap of Mints and crums of white bread, or Myrrhe mixt with Saffron and Bread. But if this impediment happen to breake, then cleanse it and heale it as you do other tumours; whereof shortly hereafter you shall haue a sufficient declaration. For the hardnesse and inflammation of womens breasts. §. 7. WHeras the Breasts, not through the congealing of the milke, but through other occasions chance to be hard and inflamed, they which may soone be felt with the hand, or discerned with the eye: then may you vse for the same any of these things following, which you will. First lay Rice about foure houres long to stéepe in wine, afterwards séeth it well, and lay it on the Breast: Or temper Rice meale with oyle of Violets, and the white of an egge, putting thereto a little dissolued Dragagant. Itē take sifted Beane meals and Barley meale, of each one ounce, Linseed meale & Fenegreeke meale, of each halfe an ounce, temper it to a salue with oyle of Roses: Lastly, ad thereto one scruple of Saffron, spread it on a cloth, and so lay it ouer the hardnesse and the whole Breast. Item take Barley meale & Beans meale, of each three ounces, beaten Comin halfe an ounce, oyle of Violets one ounce, Deeres suet one ounce and a quarter; make thereof a plaister with the water of Sorrell: and for this is also to be vsed that which is described in the sixt §. of the congealing of Milke through heate. This plaister following is exceeding good: Take the flowers of Mallowes, Violets, Celen∣dine, Daisies, and Cinquefoile, of each a handfull; let them seeth togither in sufficient water, vntil there remaine eight ounces: then straine it, and mingle it with wheaten meale, to the con∣sistence or perfection of a thicke pap, then temper with it Hens grease, or Swines suet, and so let it seeth togither vnto the plaister. This must you spread on a cloth as thicke as a finger, and lay it morning and euening vpon the inflamed and sore Breast. Another. Take Beane meale and powdred Mints, of each three quarters of an ounce, pow∣der of read Mints half an ounce, prepared Coriander and Pease meale, of each one dragme, Ro∣ses halfe a dragme, two ounces of fresh butter, muscilage of Linseede one ounce, muscillage of Fenegreeke three quarters of an ounce, Sheepes suet and Ducks grease, of each one ounce, the yolke and egge, oyle of Turpentine halfe an ounce, Saffron three graines: temper them all to∣gither and make a salue thereof. Item take the crums of two or three white loaues (according as their bignesse is) Sallad oyle three ounces, powned Hollihocke rootes one ounce and a halfe, Fenegreeke meale halfe an ounce, two yolkes of egs, oyle of Roses and of Cammomill, of each one ounce, mingle them all togither, and lay them vpon the Breasts. Item take earth wormes as many as you will, wash them with wine, & burne them to pow∣der in a tight stopt pot, temper this powder with oyle of Roses and of Lillies, and therewith annoint the Breast, and couer it ouer with fattie sheepes wooll wrapped in a cloth. This matu∣rateth very well and swageth the paine. This powder is also highly commended, taken with some sweete things, against the wormes is the belly, the waight of a dragme and a halfe, and is in like sort very good against the yellow Iaundies.
Of the tumors of swelling of the Breast. §. 8. TAke broad Plaintaine and Purslaine, of each one handfull, stampe them to pap, Commo∣mill, Melilot, of each one ounce, Barley meale foure ounces; temper them being small with oile of Violets and Roses amongst the iuice, vntill it waxe to be a thicke salue. And lastly, mingle amongst it halfe an ounce Gummi Helenij, dissolued in strong vineger, spread it on a cloth and lay it on the swelling. Item, take Salld oyle and Cow dung, mingle them and straine them through a cloth; then put Fenegréeke meale amongst it, vntill it will serue for a plaister. Or take Peach leaues onely; or as much Rue with them; stampe them to powder, let them séeth in water vntill it be a pap: lay it on the swelling: it easeth the paine, and ripeneth the im∣postume. This salue is also highly commended: Take Plantaine and Mallowes, of each one hand∣full, the lesser Housléeke sixe handfuls; let all be sodden gréene vntill it be a growt, straine it out, then adde vnto it thrée ounces of the oyle of Roses, beaten Cammomill Melilot, of each one ounce, Barley meale foure ounces, Bdellium, dissolued in vineger one quarter of an once: let them séeth together vnto the consistence of a plaister. Of the Impostumation of the Breasts. §. 9. THese impostumations do proceéed of two speciall causes: First, of congealing of the milke whereof is written alreadie: Secondly, of other bad rheumes that sinke into these parts and there putrifie, breeding there diuers accidents: as namely, the Canker, Kingwoorme, Gan∣grene, and such like. According to the nature of the foresaid rheume, it happeneth also quickly, in women which haue not their Termes, that their Breasts do impostumate by reason of the abundance of bloud, that taketh his course thither. The signes of this griefe are, that the woman hath not conceiued nor can giue sucke, that this swelling doth not deuide it selfe into many places, but remaineth in one place onely. If it be caused of bloud, than is the Breast full of paine, with beating and rednesse. Or if it come of Cholera, then is the paine greater, the breast redder, and yellowish, and with greater agues and more heate than that which procéedeth of bloud. If it be of Phlegma, then is there small paine, and no ague with it: the Breast is white, with a small tumor. For to remedie this must the cause be knowne: If it procéede of bloud, then first of all open the mother veine on the same side where the sore is, for to withdraw the matter thereby. But if there be any want of the Termes or flowers, then are they to be prouoked by all meanes pos∣sible; and in the augmenting of the swelling must the Liuer veine be opened, or at leastwise the Median: afterwards temper oyle of Roses, with Vineger, and wet a cloth therein, and lay it foure times a day vpon it: You may also séeth Cammomill therein. Of these things following you may vse which you will. Take Beane meale, Fenegréeke meale, Linséede meale, and crums of white bread, of each one ounce, Myrrhe halfe an ounce, Saffron one drag. and a halfe, rosted Hollihocke rootes foure ounces, foure yolkes of egs, oile of Violets, and Linséede oyle, of each thrée quarters of an ounce: if it be too hard, then make it softer with water, and vse it till that the swelling be ripened. Or make this following: Take sixe ounces of clarified honie, Barley meale two ounces and a halfe, two yolkes of egs, Mayrrhe and Sarcocolla, of each halfe a dragme, let the honie and the meale seethe together vntill it be méetly thicke, stir them the yolkes of the egs amongst it, and at last the powder. But if you will haue it more cooling. put thereto thrée ounces of the oyle of Roses, and hony of Roses foure ounces, and sixe ounces more of Barly meale. This is a wonderfull plai∣ster for to consume and cleanse all swellings, not onely of the breasts, but also of all other mem∣bers. Item, take Ireos, as much as you please, cut it small, then put as much oile Roses thereon as will couer the Ireos root, let it seeth very well, and straine it; afterwards put one half ounce of Ireos vnto it, oile of Voilets foure ounces, Ceruse, Waxe, and Mastick, of each one drag. and therewith annoint the Breast.
When as then this Tumor is sufficiently maturated, and will breake out, then make pap of Wheat meale, Sallad oyle, and common water. If it will not breake out of it felfe, then is it to be opened with a Lanset, and afterwards cleanse it with Hony, the iuice of Smallage, yolks of Egs and Turpentine, and a salue made thereof. Or take the common salue Vnguentum de Apio mundificatiuum,Vnguentum de Apio mundi∣ficatiuum. the which is thus to be prepared: Take clarified Hony, & the cleare iuice of Smal∣lage, of each one ounce, Wheat meale thrée quarters of an ounce, temper them togither: This is also good for all Fistulaes and Carbuncles. This Salue is to be vsed for any kind of sore, with a Tent or Lint for to cleanse the same. But if this Tumour be caused of cold, then are all warming oyles to be vsed thereto, as of Lillies, Spike, and Beuercod, and such like: And you may lay thereon water of Honysuckles, whereby diuers are holpen: but washed with water of Cardus Benedictus, and the powder of the same strewed thereon, helpeth aboue all others. All things that are ordained in the first part, the 13. Chapter and 1. §. against the vncleannes of the mouth, are also commodious for this. For to maturate, take sixe fat Figs, gréene Cresses, Dock rootes, Hollyhock rootes, Lilly rootes, Fenegréeke meale, and Linseede meale, of each one ounce, let them séeth well to a pap, stampe it well togither, and temper it with thrée ounces of Barrowes grease, this swageth the paine, and ripeneth exceedingly. When as this impostume is sufficiently ripened, open it with a Lanset in the lower part of the same, or with a Corsie, af∣terwards cleanse and heale it, as you do all other impostumes. For the Canker in the Breasts. §. 10. HItherto hath onely bin spoken of the impostumes & tumors of the breasts, where∣of otherwhiles do spring and grow the Canker, Fistulaes, & other inconueniēces: but here will we only discourse particularly of the Canker, worme, and Fistula of the breasts. For the sore which the Chirurgians call the worme, this is their common plaister: Take Rye & Wheat meale of each alike much, temper amongst it about one third part of burnt Copper powdred small, and make a dough there∣of with Rose water, spread it on a cloth, and lay it warme thereon; but this auaileth not much, a better way must be taken to cure this maladie, and so to withstand this Canker or worme. First, it is very néedful that the patient at least thrice a moneth be purged of melancholicke hu∣mors, that he keepe a good dyet in meate and drinke, and vse alwayes such things as are some∣what cooling, & very much moistening. Also he must eschue all sharp, salt, windy, and fat things, and such as are soone corrupted in the stomacke, & chiefly from all that increaseth Choleram, and Melancholiam. For to preuent this, prepare this drinke following. Take Thymus one quarter of an ounce, the rootes of Polypody and Sene, of each one dragm, the seedes of Gourds, Cucumbers, Pompeous beaten, and Violets, of each one dragme and a halfe, Cinnamome, yellow Rapeseede, of each one scruple, let them seeth altogither in eight ounces of Hopwater euen to the halfe, straine it, afterward take of this cleare decoction and temper therewith three ounces of the whay of Goats milke, and so drinke it warme, and fast sixe howers after it. Secondly make this plaister following: Take Fenegreeke and Barly meale, of each two ounces, Mallowes 3. handfuls, of great Housleeke 8. handfuls, of smal Housleeke 4. handfuls of the oyle of Roses sixe ounces, brayed in a leaden mortar: seeth the herbes in whay, afterward beate them altogither to pap, and temper the other things amongst it. Then let it seeth againe in sixe ounces of the water of Nightshade vntill it be sodden away. The patient is first to an∣noint the sore with oyle of Roses that is brayed in a leaden mortar, and afterwards let him lay this plaister following vpon the sore, and the foresayd oyle must be also prepared. Take one pound of the oyle of Roses, put it into a leaden mortar, and bray it with a leaden pestell three or foure houres long. This plaister cooleth, swageth the payne, and preserueth one from all other corrosion. Thirdly, if this Canker corrode any further, then must it by two manner of wayes be hin∣dered: first, by laying somwhat on the sore: secondly, by applying somwhat about the sore. The first shall be prepared as followeth. Take Barly meale foure ounces, of the oyle of Violets, oyle of Roses, prepared with lead,
of each thrée ounces, foure whites of Egs, prepared Tutty two ounces, Bloudstones that be stamped ten times in a leaden mortar, with the water of water Lillies one ounce, afterwards bray the whites of Egs a great while with the oile tempered amongst the Barley meale: and lastly, the Tutia, and Bloudstone, and then therewith annoint small taints, and lay them on the sore. The Second. TAke of the foresaid oyle of Roses prepared with lead one ounce and a halfe, the iuice of Nightshade two ounces, Starch one ounce, fine Bolus one ounce and a halfe, sealed earth two ounces, temper them all together in a leaden mortar, and therewith annoint round about the Canker or disease of the breast. Of the Fistula of the Breasts. §. 11. IF this or any other sore of the breast would turne to a Fistula, then looke what hath bene said in the first part the seuenth Chapter and 11. §. of the Fistula of the eyes: likewise that which is written in the third Chapter and fift part, of the impostumes of the arsegut, wherein you shall find sufficient remedies. Of the Clefts or chops of the Nipples. §. 12. TAke fresh molten suet of young Lambes powred on water, and afterwards wa∣shed with water of Roses as much as you please, and therewith annoint the Nipples. Item, take Gumme of the Cherrie trée, and Frankinsence, of each one ounce, Waxe and Gumme of each halfe an ounce: melt the Waxe with one ounce of fresh butter or Barrowes grease, then mingle the rest amongst it, and vse it as aforesaid. Take oyle of Violets and oyle of Egs, of each thrée dragms, Harts sewet and Goats sewet, of each one quarter of an ounce, make as much as is needfull for a salue. Here before in the first part, the tenth Chapter and 1. §. there are set foorth two good salues, that do also serue well for this purpose. Take a white Lillie leafe out of his oyle, and lay it on the Nipples, it is very good. All these foresaid meanes cannot hurt the child, although it do sucke at the same breasts. What the haire on the Breasts doth signifie. §. 13. THe Philosophers do agrée all together in this, that al they that haue no haire on their breasts, or very little, are more timerous, fearefull, and much slower of nature, than they be that haue much haire vpon their breasts, who are at all times more manly, stout, and couragious. The fourth Chapter. Of the Backe in generall. ON the vpper parts of the Rumpe is the backbone, which (as is said) standeth déepe into the bodie about the shoulders and ribbes: but on both the sides is the back somwhat higher. This beginneth at the necke, and reacheth downewards euen to the fundament. Foure and twenty sundry bones are imputed vnto it, the which the Gréekes do call Spondyli, and the Latinists Ʋertebras, and in our language, the chine or back bones. The necke hath seuen, which are lesse then all the rest. The back hath twelue: fiue stand also close to the loynes, whereon the last and vtmost péece of the back bone is fastened, which is called the Rump, in Latine Cauda, or the Tayle, which is ioyned together of thrée péeces, and is a Gristle or Tendrell.
The foresaid péeces of the backbones are all hollow within, filled with marrow, the which is not much vnlike the braines in substance, and yet an ofspring and beginning of all hard si∣newes. This substance of the braines may be assimilated to a plentifull fountaine, whereof many small brookes and diuers streames do flow, which we call Sinewes, whereby we haue both motion and feeling. These Sinewes are about thréescore, which do come all of them (each through his owne passage) from the backbone, and spreade themselues into al the members of mans bodie, where they cause both moouing and féeling. From them do the hands and féete, all parts of the face, and the bowels (the instruments of the voyce onely excepted) receiue their sinewes, whereby they do moue and are holden toge∣ther. Therefore doth it also happen, that whensoeuer any of these Chinebones, through the which the sinewes do passe, are wrinched or brused, either by falling, striking, or any other way, some parts are thereby lamed, lose their sense and féeling, and otherwhiles deadly diseases are thereby procured, euen as it is mentioned in diuers places of this booke, so that we purpose not to discourse here of any other thing, but of the paine or ach in the back, and of the crookednes of the same. Of the paine in the Backe. §. 1. THis paine in the backe procéedeth of Rheumes that fall into the sinewes of the muscles, or of great labour, and such like occasions, for the which these things following are good. Take Mugwoort, Melilot, and Cammomill, of each one handfull and a halfe, Melilot séedes heated in a panne, foure M. the hearbes and flowers chopt small, mixe them all together in a little bagge, and lay them warme vpon the backe bone, vse it often and that fasting. Afterwards, annoint the backe bone with this salue: Take oyle of Spike, oile of Lillies, of each halfe an ounce, oyle of Cammomill and Dill, of each one ounce, Saffron, Lauanderspike, Madder, and Agrimonie, of each one dragme, Mastick and Squinant, of each one scruple, Wa as much as is requisite for to make a salue. Item, séeth Nep in your meate, which draweth the noisome and grieuous matter out of the necke, it driueth also away all paine in the shoulders and back bones maruellously, if it be stewed in the said broth. In like manner take Siluermountaine séede, séeth it in water, and drinke thereof twice or thrice a wéeke, euery time thrée or foure ounces, for it is very good against all wearinesse, and paine in the backe and reines. Annoint the backbone with Beares grease: Also the oyle of a Foxe is effectuall against all paines of the backbone, reines, kidneys, and Gowt, the which is thus to be prepared. Oile of a FoxVncase or fley off the skinne of a young Foxe, take out his bowels, and cast him in foun∣taine water, and sea water or salt water. Put thereto thrée pounds of Sallad oile, Salt thrée ounces. When it is almost sod, then put vnto it Dill and Thymus, of each twelue ounces, let it séeth together till the flesh fall from the bones, and when all the water is sodden away, then straine it. The oyle of Brickes, which is described in the first part, is also passing good for this, either by it selfe, or when it is tempered with some other things. Of the paine in the backbone that procéedeth from the kidneys, of the grauell and other things moe, shall be spoken elsewhere. Of the crooked Backe. §. 2. THere are thrée sortes of this: The first doth come before, the second behind, and the third groweth on the left or right side. Children are more subiect to this disease then aged folke, by reason that their bones be féebler, easier to be wrested & wrung out of their naturall place. This happeneth of inward and outward causes. The outward be falles, blowes, stripes, ill handling of young children, racking and
such like bad dealing with yong tender children. The inward causes do come of the Crampe, contraction of the sinewes, abundant wind, rheumes, smellings & such like, that setle themselues in the backe bone, and do thrust and wrench awrie the yong weake bones. The signes of the Crampe, that commeth through great inanition, is manifested and appa∣rant by the consumption and faintnesse of the whole body. The signes of the windinesse are, if the patient that hath the crooke Backe haue much griping and contractions in the Backe. If there be any impostume approching, then is there great paine in the backe, or in some certaine place of the same, with a strong Ague and vehement pulse. But if there be but one of the Backe bones wrested out of his place, then must it néedes follow, that the Ribs which are fast∣ned therein, be also drawen ouerthwart, whereby the body must be crooked, and the shoulder blades raised, the which maketh an vnhandsome breast and vncomely body, as daily experi∣ence teacheth vs. Now to preuent this mischance betimes, it is first counselled for all yong folks and children, as followeth: so that at all times according to the age (as much as is possible) euery one may know how to frame himselfe thereafter. Take Comin, Caraway, Fennell, and Annis séedes, of each two handfuls, Rue séedes thrée handfuls, Bran sixe handfuls; make it all togither very warme in a pan on the hot ashes, put it then all togither into a dry bag, & lay it vpon the place where the paine is: and when the place is wel warmed, then annoint it with this salue following. Take muscilage of Fenegreek and of Linséed, of each one ounce, oyle of white Camelina, oyle of swéete Almonds, oyle of blew Flower deluce, of each one ounce and a halfe, Plaister de Muscilaginibus, (which in the first Part the sixt Chapter and seuenth §. is described) foure ounces; melt this with Waxe as much as is néedful: Lastly, adde vnto them two scruples of Saffron: do this foure dayes togither. Afterwards must the crooke Backe be bounden togither with bolsters and other things, as néede shal require, and renew the binding euery morning: Or else without putting the child to paine, do this sixe dayes one after another; and this being done, returne to the laying on of the bag, and annointing with the foresayd salue, which shall be also vsed foure dayes togither: afterwards lay this plaister fol∣lowing vpon the Backe bone and shoulder that is wrenched. Take of the foresaid plaister de Muscilaginibus two ounces, Oxycrocei plaister one ounce and a halfe, spread these vpon a cloth or leather, and lay this plaister thereon, bind it very carefully as aforesaid, and let it lye so sixe daies without opening of it. The Oxycrocei plaister is also good for this by it selfe, and profitable, which you may also find alwayes ready at the Apothecaries, like as is here described after three manner of wayes. The plaister of Oxycroceum is thus prepared: Take Waxe, Pitche, Rosin, Saffron,Oxycroceum. of each one ounce and a halfe, Turpentine, Galbanum Ammoniacum, Myrrhe, Frankinsence, and Ma∣sticke, of each half an ounce, Vineger one ounce, dissolue therein the Ammoniacum and Galbanum, then séeth them so long vntill they become thicke, and vntill that the vineger be sodden away, then melt herewith the Waxe, Pitche, and Turpentine, but the Masticke, Frankinsence, and Myrrhe shall you temper herewith first beaten small; when this is mingled all togither, then strew the Saffron therein, and mingle them al togither very well. Item, take Ammoniacum, Sagapenum, Galbanum, of each halfe an ounce, Pitch foure ounces, Rosine, Waxe, of each sixe ounces, Masticke, Frankinsence, & Myrrhe, of each one quarter of an ounce, Turpentine thrée ounces, and Saffron halfe an ounce; and make it vp as aforesayd. Oxycroceum Vigonis. TAke eight ounces of Sallad oyle, Hollihocke rootes, the lesser Consolida rootes, of each halfe a handfull, Myrrhe, Frankinsence, of each one dragme, Roses one dragme and a halfe: you are to cut and séeth the herbes and rootes in red wine and water vntill halfe be con∣sumed: straine them hard out, and in this decoction boyle the oyle, put thereto also Buckes suet two ounces: afterwards séeth it againe so long vntill all the moysture be sodden away, then put thereto thrée ounces of Lytharge of gold, Bolus, sealed earth, of each two ounces, red Lead one ounce and a quarter, Waxe one ounce, and whilest it is hot ad vnto it two ounces of Tur∣pentine, Masticke one drag. and lastly, whilest it is soft, put thereto one ounce & a halfe of pow∣ned Saffron, as is afore sayd. This last is maruellously vsed of the Chirurgians. They are all
of them not onely good against the crooke backe, but also for all fractures, and other members which are pained, and they mollifie and consume all hardnesse. It is also good for these children sometimes to drinke the water of Southernwood, of Holli∣hockes, of blew Flower deluce, of each one ounce tempered, and to vse thrée dayes after one scruple of this powder following: Take halfe an ounce of the seedes of Smallage, one dragme of Comin, Parsly séedes, Annis séedes, and Licorice mixed, of each two scruples. And you may giue the patient to eate after meate, a péece of the Confection of Pistacium or Cinnamome. And there is to be strewed vpon his meate some of this powder following: Take halfe an ounce of good Cinnamome, Licorice, and Hollihocke séedes, of each halfe a scruple, Saffron one scruple, stampe them all together, and mingle them one amongst another. If this patient be but ten or twelue yeares old, then were it very good twice in a wéeke, al∣waies before supper, that he swallow one of these pilles following: Take prepared Aloe one dragme and a halfe, Bdellium halfe a dragme, Smallage seedes halfe a scruple, and make seuen pils of a dragme. But if on an aged bodie there grow a crooked backe, then must he vse the pils of Hermoda∣ctilis, Foetidae, or Cochiae to purge withall. All the meates that he is to vse, must be hot vnto the se∣cond, and drie in the first degrée, therefore must his chamber be alwaies kept with a fire of Fir¦wood, Iuniper wood and such like, that must burne therin, & to fume the same with Bay leaues, white Mints, Penniroyall, Styrar, Laudanum, Cypers wood, Gallia Muschata, Sandaraca, Lignum Aloes, Frankinsence, Masticke, and such like, each alone, or tempered together. He must for∣beare cloudie weather, raine, and dewes, and vse no exercise: also he must not sléepe much, nor lie much on the same side of the crooked back, and he must refraine lying vpon his backe, that his breath be not thereby painefull to be drawne: watching is also ill for him. Further, he must forbeare all that is made of meale: but Kids flesh, Mutton, Hares, Roe déere, and young Beares flesh are very good for him, and specially if the same be drest with gar∣den Mints, wild Mints, wild Thime, Parsly, and Balme. Of fowles these be good for him, Hens, Capons, Pullets, yong Pigeons, Fesants, Partriges Turtle doues, and wild Pigeons, either boyled or rosted, being drest with the foresaid herbes. He may also eate rosted Duckes, and also all field fowles: but Quailes (by reason of their moi∣sture) he shall leaue. Fish is not good for him, and especially those that be sodden, except they be drest with the foresayd herbes: but being rosted they are for his disease most méete, except Eeles, Crabs, Mussels, Oysters, the which very seldome are to be vsed: and he must forbeare all Beanes. All hearbes of cold natures are hurtfull for him, as Lettice, Burrage, Purslaine, Spinage, &c. Of all séedes he may vse them that are of a warme nature, as Comin, Caraway, Annis séedes, Parsley seede, Cardamome, and Greines. Touching rootes, the wild and tame yellow Rapes or Turneps, and also all other Turneps may he vse: but he must beware of Onions, Garlicke, and Radishes. No hearbes of cold natures are meete for his sallads, neither yet Capers; but Rapunculu, Sperage, Hop sprigs, may passe well enough, drest rather with wine then with vineger. Sal∣ted or powdered Veriuice, the iuice of Limons, and iuice of Orenges be tolerable: but he must beware of eager Vineger, and Pomegranate wine. He may vse all manner of spice (but soberly alwaies in his meate) he must forbeare all cold and new fruite, as Apples, Peares, Cherries, Peaches, &c. but in the steade thereof he may eate Raisins, dried Figs, Almonds, and Hasell Nuts. His drinke must be small Beere, or some thin well sauouring wine, he may water the wine with some water, wherin Cinnamome or Licorice hath bene decocted. But aboue all other, it were good for him (if he can come by it) for to vse from the middest of September to the middest of March, this drinke following, or at leastwise temper his wine therewith. Take Well water seuen quarts, cleare Honie foure and twenty ounces, Ammy flowers, and Marioram gentle, of each one drag. Basill seede halfe a drag. Artichoke rootes three drag. Rue seedes two scruples, shauing of Licorice and Annis seedes, of each three drag. let the water and honie seeth together till there be about two quarts sodden away, letting it remaine still all
a night, and in the morning make it hot againe and straine it through a cloth, preserue it being stopt close, for it will do him good. The learned do giue counsell accordingly, that euery such patient must purge twice a yeare, to wit, in the beginning of Sommer, and beginning of Winter, and that according as a lear∣ned Phisition shall aduise him. Further, for this disease of the crooked back are two things to be regarded: first, that it do not increase: secondly, how to take away the same. For which, this plaister following is to be made. Take oyle of Cammomill, oile of Lillies, and Althea salue, of each one ounce, oyle of Foxes one ounce and a half, oile of Spike one quarter of an ounce, soft Stirax one quarter of an ounce, Cypers, Sage, Marioram gentle, Squinant, Stechas, Wormwood, Melilot, and Linseede, of each halfe a handfull, prepared Earthwoormes, and Nutmegs, of each one ounce, Hollihockes, halfe an ounce, séeth these all together in a pint of Wine vnto the halfe, then straine it through a cloth, and make a hard plaister thereof with Waxe and Turpentine. But before this plaister is to be laid vpon it, the crooke back must be wel fomented with this following: Take Hollihocks two handfuls, Calmus halfe an ounce, Mallowes, Cammomill, Dill, Linséede, and Melilot, of each one handfull, Spike, Squinant, Fennell, Comin, Worm∣wood, and Stechas, of each halfe a handfull, cut them small, and let them séeth well. And it were also very good that he vsed these pils all the yeare, take prepared Aloe one ounce, Opopanacum, Sagapenum, of each halfe a dragme, temper them all with the iuice of Roses, take one pill thereof about the fourth day euery euening before meate: and if so be that he do take twice a moneth the waight of one dragme of these pils one houre after supper, it is very good for him and good aduice. These confections following shall also be prepared for him: Take Betonie, Stechas,An especiall remedie a∣gainst the crook backe. Mario∣ram gentle, Bdellion, Mastick, Rue séede, and Cinamome, of each one quarter of an ounce, pow∣ned Calmus thrée dragmes, rootes of Artichokes one dragme and a halfe, red and white Behen, Saffron and Nutmegs, of each thrée scruples, Licorice foure scruples, Hony of confected Gin∣ger twelue ounces, and white Sugar two ounces, wherof take throughout the whole yeare be∣fore meate the quantitie of a Nutmeg. And this is a speciall meane whereby this disease may be holpen. But if the patient cannot take of it euery day, yet is he notwithstanding to vse the same euery third day, or twice a weeke. Many things commodious for the crooke backe. SEcondly, all these things following are good for this crooke backe, Zeduary chewed, or laid vpon the outside, likewise Calmus be it confected or otherwise vsed, Centory is very good for all infirmities of the sinewes, howsoeuer they be. Gumme Sagapenum in manner of a plaister laid thereon, or annointed therewith, is very forcible for it. Muscilage of Fenegréeke made with lie, and the shoulders and all the backbone rubbed therewith. Sulphur baths alone haue oftentimes brought that to passe, through a hole whereby the vapor may come against the backe. The decoction of Sperage being drunken, is very good for this. A good salue. Take oyle of Bricks one ounce, oile of Costus halfe an ounce, the plaister Cero∣neum Nicolai thrée ounces, temper them together, and therewith annoint the backbone for the space of one whole moneth when one goeth to bed: then couer it with shéepes wooll. Betony sodden in all meates is very commodious, or a dragme thereof powdered drunken with Hony water. The rootes of Briony sodden, and the decoction thereof vsed for Clisters, is also very good, and the whole backbone fomented or bathed therewith. Of the shoulder blades. §. 3. THe shoulder blades do suffer sometimes great paine, and that through many kind of causes, like as through any cholericke or flegmatick humors that be mingled with some bloud, and fall downe into the shoulder blades, and there prouoke paine, that spreadeth it selfe afterwards into other members, which is known by féeling and handling of it. For this,
make this salue following: Take oyle of yellow Violets one ounce and a halfe, of Costus one ounce, burnt Iuorie, red and white Saunders, and Roses, of each one dragme, Starch one ounce and a halfe, Saffron one scruple, yolks of egs two scruples, stamp all small that are to be stamped, and temper it in a mortar. Item, take muscilage of Fleawoort, Starch, of each one ounce and a halfe, Saffron one scru∣ple, Roses, séedes of Plantaine, Sorell, and small Endiue, of each halfe a dragm, and the yolks of two egs, stamp all these small together, and then make them into a salue, and when you wil vse it, then let the shoulders be first well rubbed, and warme the salue. These things be also very good for all paines of the backbone and of the kidneis. For this also serueth the salues of Aragon, and Marciaton, oyle of Saffron, oile of Foxes, and Badgers grease, of each alike much tempe∣red together. In like manner also the oyle of Pieretrum, oyle of Euphorbium tempered together, or each apart, do serue well for all old paines, for they are very hote. Further, all that is very commo∣dious which purgeth the head; Cupping, or boxes set on the shoulders, being annointed with this salue following: take vnripe Sallad oile one ounce, oyle of Euphorbium halfe an ounce, par∣ched Salt beaten small one quarter of an ounce, and temper al together. If there come any such paine with any vehemencie whereby the sléepe is hindred, then take oyle of swéet Almonds, oyle of Cammomill, of each half an ounce, oyle of yellow Violets one ounce and a halfe, Ducks grease, Badgers grease, and Saffron, of each one dragme, make a salue thereof with Waxe. Item, take Cammomill, Melilot, Dill séede, Ameos, Balme, and Marioram gentle, of each one ounce, let it séeth well, and put it together in a bladder, or (which is more commodious) into a sponge, and so lay it warme vpon it. Or take Colewoort leaues, Betonie and Balme, of each thrée handfuls, Beane meale two ounces, Wheat meale and Linséed meale, of each one ounce and a halfe, Saffron one dragme, and two yolkes of egs: Séeth the hearbes vntill they be soft, then stampe them all together, and lay them on all together, as is done with other plaisters. Of the Ribbes. §. 4. AFter the said backbone and shoulder blades, there followeth amongst the out∣ward members of the vppermost parts of the body ye Ribs, whereof by nature there are twelue on each side, which is together foure and twentie. The vpper∣most fourtéene do méete together, whereby they ioyne themselues in the back∣bone and on the breast, and become as it were one bone. The lowermost fiue of each side are named the short ribs, and there is not one man amongst a thou∣sand, that hath 11. or 13. ribs in one side. When as then the Ribs through any outward cause, shall be thrust or broken out of their naturall places, or else rotten through any long continued impostume, the Chirurgians must be entertained for them, vnto whom I commit them; yet notwithstanding, these two remedies following are highly commended. If then any body haue broken or sprung a rib, then take Ele∣campane rootes, rosted amongst the ashes, beate them to growt, raw Hony, Butter, Horsgrease and Althea salue, of each a like much, let it séeth well together: Secondly, vse one of the foresaid plaisters of Oxycroceo, and lay it ouer the ribs. Vnder and about the ribs commeth the most pe∣rillous sicknesse Pleuritis, which is the Pleurisie, of Pleura, whereby the Gréeks call the ribbes, whereof we will now write. Of the Pleurisie, Pleuritis, a sicknesse, with great pricking in the side. §. 5. THis sicknesse is described by Galen as followeth. Pleuritis is a paine of the side or of the ribs, which is spread abroad in the skinne that couereth the ribs, euen to the shoulders, with Agues, pricking paine, cold, short breath, and cough. He doth further describe the same sicknesse in another maner, saying: the Pleurisie commeth in the skinne that couereth the ribs, with an inflammation of all the muscles thereabouts, with a strong Ague and with such paine, as though the whole ribs were thrust through with bodkins, with shortnes of breath, slow pulse, which after∣wards
increaseth, with a vehement cough, sometimes without auoiding any thing, and other∣whiles by casting out of bloudie matter. These manners of Pleurisies the learned do call Incoctas Pleuritides, which is vnripe Pleuri∣sies. It séemeth also sometimes that this paine doth stretch it selfe euen to the throate, and is alwaies with a strong ague and pricking in the side, whereby there followeth of necessitie a shortnes of breath. But this Pleurisie bringeth with it no spettle, and there is no other diffe∣rence betwéene it and the other Pleurisie, the which may be only differenced thereby, that at the last nothing is coughed vp. All they then that haue the Pleurisie without spetting, they will be plagued with a drie cough. Their pulse is faint, and sheweth no inflaming in the breast, and there is no strong ague, nor any combrous breath therewith: and when one doth wring the patient in the place of the paine, then will he féele paine; and by reason that there is no humor which may be enflamed in the brest, from the beginning, but in the outward muscles only, which humor being afterwards ripened, sheweth it selfe outwardly as an impostume, the which may be opened outwardly. Thus much testifieth Galen in this matter, wherby his successors do conclude, that there be two kinds of Pleurisies, to wit, a right and a bastard Pleurisie. Of the true Pleurisie hath here bene spoken: the bastard Pleurisie is called that, which is opened on the outside. But we will in these and moe other subtill descriptions not vse many circumstances. First, there are many causes of these Pleurisies. The outward causes may be vnnaturall heate or cold, much exercise, Northern winds, euen as these sicknesses do raigne more in winter than sommer, superfluous drinking of cold water or wine, carying of heauie burthens, falling, straining, striking, and after great heate to come suddenly into the cold, as also by drinking much Must. The inward causes proceede by repletion of the whole bodie, and alwaies most (a∣boue all other humors) through Cholera, afterwards of bloud, thirdly of Phlegma, and very sel∣dome of Melancholia. In like manner, wind may bréede this false Pleurisie, the which may hereby be knowne, to wit, through anguish of the side without coughing, or with some small cough: and if the place be wrung or touched, then will it cause paine, that so swelleth otherwhiles and rankleth, that it breaketh out outwardly, or that it must be opened on the outside. The true tokens of the Pleurisie you heard out of Galens owne words: but that it may be knowne of what humors it procéedeth, is to be marked by these words following; in that of Cholera the vrine is yellow and thin, the pulse hard, swift, and continuing, the pain is great and pricking, the whole body yellowish, the spettle mingled with a little rednes, there is much thirst approching, with bitternesse of the mouth, and no sléep, with diuers other accidents moe, which Cholera commonly causeth. But if the Pleurisie do procéed of bloud, then is the vrine red and thicke, the spettle ruddie, the veines full, the pricking paine is not so big, but there is drouth and anguish with it, the mouth is alwaies swéete, the forehead and eyes are alwaies heauie, the patient is young of yeares and full of bloud. The tokens of Phlegma are, when the spettle is white, when the paine is not too great, when there is but little thirst, and much sléepe therewith, the vrine is bleake, slow pulse, and other signes moe that Phlegma accustometh to bring with it. The Melancholia causeth the spettle to be a little leaden coloured, wherewith is no sorenesse or continuall paine. In like sort, there are certaine tokens of life or death. The signes of death are these, when no remedies will helpe, and all accidents, as paine, pricking, shortnes of breath daily increase: and contrariwise, it is a token of life, when all they diminish. Commonly the stitch in the left side is more perillous than that in the right side, for that it is nearer the hart. But to come to the remedies, then will we first take in hand the Pleurisie which procéedeth of heate and of bloud. Of the Pleurisie of heate and bloud. §. 6. WHen as any bodie getteth a pricking paine about the ribs in the side, with a cough and an Ague, then must he first vse this Clister following: Take 16. ounces of broth wherein a Lambes head or Calues féete be sodden. Put therein one ounce of flight Sugar, the yolke of one Egge, two ounces of Sallad oile, Salt one dragme and a halfe, temper
them all togither. If néede be to make a strong Clister, Take Pompeon seede, Cucumber séede, and Gourds, of each half a handfull, Purslaine seede & Lettice seede powned togither, of each one dragme, Mallowes, Béetes, Violets, and Mercurie, of each halfe a handful; seeth them togither in sufficient water euen to the halfe part; then take of this decoction twelue or sixteene ounces, and temper therein oyle of Violets three ounces, Electuarium de Psyllio two ounces, Cassia and Tho. Sugar, of each halfe an ounce, Salt one quarter of an ounce; and set it warme. In like manner it is needeful to let bloud with speede. Therefore is the liuer veine to be ope∣ned, and that (like as all learned and also Galen himselfe teacheth) in the same side where the paine is: for this helpeth very soone, and the other very slowly. But Rasis maketh this difference: If that the patient be full of bloud, then first must ye vein be opened in the side where there is no paine, and that not onely once, but also oftentimes, euen as the sicknesse doth require, and the maladie doth continue, the which may be fortie dayes continually. But if there be great weak∣nesse or any other occasion at hand, that one durst not open the veine, then at the least set cups or boxes vnder the paine with much pricking, as the cause importeth. And after letting bloud, thē annoint the place of the paine or Stitch with oyle of Cammomill, oyle of Dill, or with this salue following, the which is stronger: Take oyle of sweede Almonds, oyle of Violets, and vn∣salted Butter, of each one ounce, Althea salue halfe an ounce, muscilage of Hollihocks, and of Frankinsence, of each halfe an ounce, Waxe as much as is needefull: annoint the place there∣with where the stitch is, and afterwards lay this plaister thereon: Take rosted Hollihocke rootes three dragmes, Violets and Cammomill, of each one quarter of an ounce, Barley meals three quarters of an ounce: Temper them togither with the oyle of Cammomill and Violets as much as is needefull for a plaister, and lay it warme on the place of the paine: It swageth the paine, and the stitch that proceedeth of hote Cholera. Another that is also verie good. TAke dry Violets, red Saunders, Barley meale, the seedes of Mallowes, Bran, Cammo∣mill, and Melilot, of each a like much, powne all that is to be powned, & make it with oyle of Cammomill and Waxe to a plaister. And if therewith the paine do not cease and swage, then put Beane meale, Fenegreeke meale, and Linseede meale vnto it, of each one quarter of an ounce, and one Fig or twaine: and vse this so long, vntill the paine (as may seeme to the eye) be delayed and swaged, and vntill the spettle auoyd more easily. The order of diet. ALbeit that the abstinence from eating and drinking is very highly commended of all old Phisitions, who haue commanded for the first three or foure dayes onely Barley water to be vsed: yet is the custome of our countrey and nature, not to obserue it so strictly: but (according to their command) to keepe all possible abstinence, is very good aduice, yet in such manner, that nature, aswell through such great abstinence, as by reason of the sicknesse it selfe, be not ouerthrown. Others do prescribe as followeth: If the sick body the first or second day do cough vp no flegme, then is he to be kept with Barley water onely: But if he hath bene purged and let bloud, then shall he at noone drinke Barley water, or the decoction of red Pease: At night he is to be fed with the crum of white bread, that is steeped in sugred Almond milke, and after it to drinke a good draught or twaine of Almond milke. Whē as he cougheth vp much flegme, then may he eate well of a sugred Pomegranate, and so moderate himself thrée or foure dayes. Afterwards, whē the flegme beginneth to be white or red, and to come easily, then may one let him sup vp a little broth of a Pullet, with a little Saffron, which strengtheneth the hart and ri∣peneth flegme. Is the matter cold? then let a little Hyssope and Parsly rootes be sodden therein. For a cold Pleurisie a little wine may be well afforded, the which in a hot Pleurisie is not to be permitted. After the seuēth day must his meate be the broth of Pullets, Barley pap, stued Rai∣sins, Figs, Prunes that are alwayes drest with a little Saffron, or Parsly rootes. Sometimes also are good broyled riuer fish, and rosted Pullets or Chickens permitted. And when as the Ague hath cleane forsaken the patient, then may he eate measurably Pul∣lets, Partridges, Capons, Turtle doues, Pigeons, Rabets, & rere egs, vntill he haue throughly
recouered his health. He must also kéepe himselfe alwaies warm, and to sweate a mornings: he may otherwhiles for pleasure eate Raisins, Figs, Pine apple kernels, and also two or three Dates, yet he must alwaies haue regard that he kéepe a soluble bodie: & to this end these herbes following are to be drest and vsed; as Spinage, Orage, Burrage, Lettice, Violets and Mal∣lowes, with Almond milke, the which is good also for all hote coughes: Shéepes féet sodden very mellow are passing good for him. His bread must be wheaten or barley well baked; soppes of bread and Almond milke with Sugar pennets, are very méete for him. Contrarily, he must ab∣staine from Vineger, Veriuice, and all sowre and salt things; and likewise from eating and drinking too much. Also from smoke, wind, loud crying, wrath and sorrow, and aboue all, is carnall copulation hurtfull. Hereafter haue you yet many moe potions that serue for such hote Pleurisies. Wine must be for this vtterly forborne, and in stead thereof he must be cherished with Almond milke, or with sugred Barley water, the which for all Pleurisies is much vsed and commended. And it is principally to be drest in this manner:Barley water. Take pilled Barley one pound, wash it very cleane, afterwards powre nine pound of water vnto it, and let it séeth euen to the halfe; then straine it through a cloth. This is good for all infirmities of the breast: it loo∣seth flegme, and withstandeth the Ague. Some do séeth with this barly water, Figs, Iuiubes, Currans or Licorice, and such like, euery one according to his owne pleasure. Some do take vine Snailes out of their shels, and séeth them with the Barley water, which cause the tough slime in the brest to auoide and driue it out. For daintie folkes you may prepare this decoction: Take a Hen or a Pullet, séeth there∣with a good handfull of Barley vntill the flesh go from the bones, straine it, and temper it with the foresaid Barley water. Item, take white bread crums, bind them in a fine cloth, stéep them in Barley water, straine them often thorough, and put thereto as much Sugar as you please. Item, take pilled Barley halfe a handfull, Iuiubes, Sebestes, of each ten, or in their steade fiue Figs, one ounce and a halfe of Raisins, Licorice and Currans, of each halfe an ounce, cut all that is to be cut by a mild fire in as much water as you thinke good. Or take Licorice cut small three quarters of an ounce, Currans two ounces, Sugar candie one ounce, Barly a good spoonefull, and a pint of water or as much as you will, let it seeth till about the third part re∣maine, and vse it as aboue. To euery such patient is not onely forbidden wine, & other things, but also spices, Mustard, Garlicke, hard and old flesh, Egs, Cheese, Milke, and all that is drest therwith, he must forbeare all fruites and hearbs, except such as be soluble and do open the bodie. In fine, all that warmeth and hindereth the ripening of flegme, like as all sowre and cold things do. Here follow many things against the Pleurisie. SO soone as the common people find not speedie amendement of the expert Phisitions, then will they be incensed therewith and discontented, and will go seeke for other counsell: therefore are these things following very well to be vsed, where there is any great heate approaching: Take Corne roses one quarter of an ounce, stamp them, and wring out the iuice, and drinke it with Violet water in the beginning of the sicknesse: it is a very good remedie. This following is commended for an especiall mastrie in the Pleurisie: Take the red skinne out of the Hasell nut and their shales, make them very drie, stampe them, and giue them to the patient twice or thrice a day with Carduus Benedictus water, or Endiue water. But if you will haue it stronger, then vse the red skin alone, take out that which is in the shel, and leaue the shel, and giue him thereof a scruple, which suffiseth at one time. Some do counsell for to take the water of water Lillies before the Pleurisie be full possest, for a preseruation of the Pleurisie. But I cannot wel agree thereto. A wonderfull remedie that might be tried. TAke a tooth of a wild Boare, file from it two scruples, and drinke this powder with Sca∣bious water or Well water: And you may also take it with two or three ounces of sweet oile of Almonds; for the oyle of sweet Almonds (taken with Sugar candie) is a blessed
medicine for the Pleurisie. This is also good for it, conserue of Violets, and of water Lillies; and both these sirupes, to wit, the sirupes of Endiue and Pomegranates, and specially the cold Dragagant losinges which are described in the first part, the 14. Chapter and 2. §. In like man∣ner the confection of Diapenidion, Diapapauer, and conserue of Roses, and in great distresse and weaknesse Pearle sugar, which is called Diamargariton Frigidum. These waters following are also very good for this sicknesse, as water of Carduus Benedictus, of Dandelion, of Leuisticum, of Cicorie, Violets, Burrage, Buglosse, and all that is made with all manner of Sugar candies, Sugar pennets, and of Licorice. And héede must alway be taken, that the patient in the time of this sicknesse haue alwaies an open bodie, the which may alwaies easily be brought to passe, through the common Clisters and Suppositories, whereof we haue here before mentioned twaine, the which may be made stronger or weaker, according as néede requireth. Likewise it is very commodious also to giue the patient two ounces of Manna, within thrée ounces of broth, wherein were sodden Iuiubes and Violets. And if so be that the sicknes be not too vehement, and ouerthroweth the patient not too sore, then may he vse these sirupes, to wit, sirupe of Violets one ounce, sirupe of Licorice halfe an ounce, Barley water, wherein Violets or Licorice were sodden, thrée ounces; giue him this in the morning early, and vse it certaine dayes one after another. For this serueth also the sirupe of Poppey heads, although it were but to prouoke sléepe. Another. Take Endiue, small Endiue, Liuerwoort, Lettice, and Venus haire, of each a hand∣full, péeled Melon séedes, Gourd séedes, Cotton séedes, Violets, water Lilly flowers, of each one ounce, Sugar twelue ounces, make a sirupe thereof, and vse it as is afore said; wherupon, take this purgation, to wit, new Cassia two ounces, of the foresaid broth foure ounces, and giue it him in the morning early very warme. You may also put thereto halfe a dragme of Rubarbe, and halfe a scruple of Spica. But in case that the patient be very narrow in the brest, as it often hapneth in this sicknes, then take Manna, and new Cassia, of each three quarters of an ounce, and make thereof a drinke with the foresaid broth. For this, are also these confections following to be vsed: Take Diapenidion without spices, and two ounces of the conserues of Violets, mixe them together, and vse it often. Take sirupe of Iuiubes, and sirupe of Violets, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, temper them with the wa∣ter of Folefoote and of Buglosse, take this also once a day when you please. But of the narrow∣nes or passions of the breasts, you shall afterwards in this Chapter find many good remedies. An expedite cure of the Pleurisie. AS soone as the pain of the Pleurisie is felt, shal boxes be fastned on the place of the paine, for this helpeth maruellously. Then open a vein on the contrarie arme, and the next mor∣ning in the same side where the griefe is. Afterwards thou shalt giue him this sirupe following, as you find the sicknesse to be either hote or cold. And when you find that the matter ripeneth or digesteth a little, then apply this plaister following vpon the place affected: Take Hollihock rootes, Mallowes, Violet leaues, and Cammomill, of each one handfull, decoct thē in water, and beate them to growt, adde as much oile of Almonds as shall be néedfull. But if the flegme will not be raised and spet foorth, then set boxes on the place againe as before, with picking, and let them draw well. Also adde to fiue ounces of his drinke, two ounces of Oxymel of Squils, for that it breaketh the tough flegme, and casteth it foorth with ease. Of the Pleurisie of Cholera. §. 7. IF the Pleurisie procéed of Cholera, then are soluble medicins to be vsed at ye first, like as hereafter follow: take Endiue, small Endiue, Lettice, Liuerwoort, white Diptamus, Venus haire, (all gréene if they can be gotten) of each a handfull, péeled Melon séed, Pompeon séed, Cucūber séed, Gourd séed, séeds of Hollihocks & Bur∣rage flours, of each half an ounce, pilled Barly one ounce, Licorice, Currans, Iu∣iubes, Sebestes, of each one drag. Violets and water Lillies of each half an ounce, séeth them all together, and with twelue ounces of Sugar make a sirupe thereof, euen as we
haue taught before. And the common sirupe of Iuiubes is also good for this. Item, in stead of the foresayd things may you vse this following. Take sirupe of Violets three ounces, sirupe of Poppie heads, of Venus haire, of each one ounce and a halfe: mingle these togither with sufficient water of Endiue, and so drinke it at twice, afterwards take this purgation: Take Violets, Borage flowers, and Buglosse flowers, of each halfe an ounce, Prunes, Iuiubes and Sebestes, of each ten, Spikenard halfe a dragme, Licorice and Currans, of each fiue dragmes, let them all séeth well togither: then take foure ounces of this decoction, and stéepe therein halfe, or a whole dragme of Ru∣barbe, let it so stand in a warme place all night, and drinke it warme. This being done, lay vpon the affected place a sponge that is made wet in warme water, wherein Cammomill, Violets, and Dill are decocted. But if these herbes be not to be gotten, take warme Well water, and wring out the sponge meetely well, you may do the like with a bladder that is filled with warme milke and Linseede oyle, and so lay it ouer the place of the paine. Or you may vse this: Take a pinte of milke, and two pintes of hony tempered well togither, and layd with tow vpon the place. Item, take Mallowes, and Hollihocke rootes, of each one handfull, chop them well togither, and fry it with butter or Sallad oyle, and so lay it vpon the paine. This following is good to expell the bloud: Take Bolus and Salt, of each a like much, make them to pap with hony, and bind it on the place where the paine is. Hereafter follow Plaisters, Salues, and such like. TAke crums of white bread about fower ounces, fresh Butter or Sallad oyle, thrée ounces, Hollihocke rootes two ounces, Fenegreeke halfe an ounce: cut, stampe, and seeth it well in Goates milke, mellow to pap: and when it is almost cold, then stir amongst it one dragme of beaten Saffron, and so lay it warme on the paine. Item, take beaten Hollihock rootes, Mallow seedes, and Barley meale, of each a like much, let it séeth togither in Goates milke vntill it be thicke inough, then put thereto sufficient oyle of Cammomill, and spread it on a cloth. You haue here before in the fift §. of the pricking of the pleurisie two plaisters of rosted Hollihocke rootes, the which are maruellous good for this. This also following is very excel∣lent for the great stitch and oppression of the breast: Take halfe a pound of Cassie taken out of pipes, as is taught in the Preface, temper amongst it one ounce of the salue of Althea, oyle of sweete Almonds, and powned Hollihocke rootes, of each two ounces, spreade them on a cloth, and make thereof a plaister, and lay it on the stitch. Item, take fower ounces of white bread crum, soften them one hower in Goates milke, afterwards powne them well, then put thereto one ounce and a halfe of Cassie, three whites of egges, Saffron ten graines, and oyle of Roses as much as is needefull for a plaister. Of the Pleurisie of Phlegma. §. 8. IF the Pleurisie proceede of flegmatick humors, and that the paine draw down∣ward toward the lowermost rib, then is the patient to take oftentimes halfe an ounce of the conserues of Hyssope, tempered with Carduus Benedictus water, and a little Saffron. Other do take a sweete Apple, which they make hollow, and fill it with Fran∣kinsence, & then stop the hole againe with a peece of an Apple, cleaued to round about with dow, & so let it rost a while. This Apple is eaten as a preseruatiue against the Pleu∣risie, that people might not be taken with it, although they be subiect to it. Item, take a sweete Apple, cut a peece out of it, and put therein one scrup. of beaten Mastick, close it againe with the same peece. Rost this Apple in hot ashes, and so eate it. Take the vpper∣most crops of Nettles, seeth them in Wel water, and straine out the iuice through a cloth, giue him therof at two or three times in the beginning of the sicknes, three ounces at one time. For purging of this flegmatike matter, prepare these sirupes following: Take Hyssope and Venus haire, of each two handfuls, pilled Melon seedes, Pompion seedes, Gourd seedes, Cucumber seedes, Butchers broome seede, Sperage seedes, Lineseede and Fenegreeke seedes, of each one drag. good vineger half an ounce, cut and powne all that is to be cut and powned, let them seeth
all together. To this decoction put thrée ounces of clarified Honie, nine ounces of Sugar, then make thereof a sirupe: this is passing good when the Phlegma is thicke and tough. But if you will not make a sirupe for it, then take common sirupe, to wit, of Venus haire, of Licorice, or Hyssope: but the sirupe of Licorice is maruellously commended for this. For a purgation: take Violets. Buglosse flowers, and Burrage flowers, of each one ounce, Licorice, Currans, of each two ounces, two or three Figs, Agaricus one dragme and a halfe, let all these stéepe and séeth together, take foure ounces thereof and temper therewith thrée dragms of the confection Eleschoph, and then drinke it at one draught. When you haue purged, then annoint the paine with the oyle of Dill, or oyle of Lillies; after∣wards seeth Cammomill and Venus haire in water and vineger in a bag, straine it out, and then lay it warme vpon the paine. Item, take Barly and Pease, of each one ounce and a halfe, Branne one handfull, beate them grosse and make thereof a bag of a quarter of a yard broade, seeth it, and vse it as aboue. Thirdly, take Myly and Salt as much as you will, warme it toge∣ther in a pan, put it into a bag, and lay it warme thereon, especially if the matter be windy. Of the Pleurisie of Melancholia. §. 9. BVt if this disease procéed of Melancholia, (which chanceth seldome) then straine the iuice of one handfull of Burrage and Buglosse, and being clarified, giue it him with the foresaid sirupe. For purging, take black Hellebore, Thime, Epy∣thimus, the rootes of Polipodie, Sene leaues, and such like, euen as in the des∣cription of Melancholie, in the first part the twelfth Chapter and eight §. is taught. When as the sicke person beginneth to cough vp phlegme, then it is necessarie that he vse to drinke for it euery day of common Barly water a good draught, of the decoction which here be∣fore in the cold Rheume in the second Chapter is expressed, and beginneth thus: Take twentie Iuiubes, &c. which cleanseth the breast. And if the great pricking and shooting remaine, and he do cough with paine, then is the patient to drink of this potion following three or foure mornings together: Take tenne fat Figs, fat Dates, Smallage séede, Fennell séedes, Venus haire, Licorice, Hyssop, and Mallowes, of each fiue dragmes, séeth them all together in sixe and thirtie ounces of water to the halfe, and trouble not your selfe therein, albeit the patient should cough vp mat∣ter or corruption. Of the bastard or false Pleurisie. §. 10. WE haue mentioned heretofore of the false Pleurisie in the fifth §. and made her nature knowne. If the patient haue plenty of bloud, then is his Saphaea or liue veine to be opened. Afterwards, set vpon the place of the stitch, a cup or boxe or twaine with pricking, or according as the humors in that sicknesse do raigne, as bloud, Cholera, Flegma, or Melancholia do excéede, and afterwards purge and vse stronger Clisters than for the true Pleurisie were prescribed. But in case that the patient féele this stitch about the Diaphragma, then open the Median, and vse the fore∣said warming things, that deuide the matter: let the place be often rubbed with a hand or cloth that thereby the pores may be opened. This being done, then lay this plaister following ther∣upon: Take two ounces of Fenegreeke meale, and Pitch three ounces, Waxe one ounce, most them both, and mingle the meale amongst it, with oyle of Cammomill to a plaister which you may spread on Leather, and couer it with silke, and so lay it on the stitch. But if the Ague be not too big, then may you vse thereto the Oxycroceum plaister. Item, take the ashes of Cole∣woorts, tempered with Pullets or Swines grease. But if the anguish shew it selfe outwardly, and yet wil impostume but slowly, then must the same be opened, be it with an hote iron or with a Lancet. What doth loose phlegme, that shal be set downe hereafter in the description of the cough, of the shortnes breath, whether it proceed of heate or cold. But if the phlegme that at the first shall be coughed vp, be blacke and yellow together one amongst another, and that the Ague end not on the seuenth day, then it is a very bad signe, if therewith be any heauie ratling in the throte, with rednes of the cheekes, lead co∣loured and darke eyes, then is death at hand.
When the Pleurisie sheweth it selfe outwardly. IF the Pleurisie shew it selfe outwardly, with any rednesse, and the partie feeleth great paine in the touching of it, then it is a certaine token of a false and bastard Pleurisie, that is setled outwardly on the ribs. For the same, is a cup or boxe to be set thereon, or to lay a blistering plaister of Figs and Mustard séeds, and let it lye thereon so long, vntill the place begin to impo∣stumate, and then open it, and heale it like as other impostumes. But if the matter waxe hard, then it is to be maturated with this plaister following: Take Hollihocke leaues one handfull, Cammomill, Melilot, and violet leaues, of each halfe a handfull, Fenegréeke seede, and Linséed beaten small, of each halfe an ounce, Beane meale, and Barly meale, of each two handfuls, oile of swéet Almonds, oile of Dill, and of Violets, of each one ounce, then temper the one with the other, and so lay it on the place. Hereafter follow plaisters and salues that asswage the stitch and pain, be it of whatsoeuer occasion it may be. Take Mallowes, and Hollihocke rootes, of each one handfull, séeth them together to pap, and then stamp them together with oile of Vio∣lets, and Barowes grease, and so lay it on the sore: but let it not lie too long theron, that the mat∣ter be not maturated too soone. Item, take oile of yellow Violets two ounces, of the oyle of swéet Almonds and oile of Cammomill, of each halfe an ounce, fresh Butter one ounce, Saffron one dragme and a halfe, white Waxe one ounce and a halfe, Dill seede, Cammomill, Duckes grease, of each halfe an ounce, and thrée yolks of Egs: make thereof a salue or plaister. This poultis following, doth much asswage the paine: take Branne as much as you please, séeth it in Wine vnto a pap, and put thereto a little Salt. Another. Take vnripe Sallad oyle thrée ounces, foure fresh yolks of Egs, Saffron one drag. new oile of Roses one ounce and a halfe, seeth it a while, and set it on warme ashes, and stirre well amongst it the beaten yolkes of Egs: put afterwards vnto it Starch and Barly meale, of each one drag. and a halfe, and last of all the Saffron: if you will haue it more forcible, then put fresh Butter to it, and Bdellium, of each one drag. and séeth it with decocted swéet Wine, as thicke as you desire it. Or vse this following. Take Cammomill, Dill seede, Venus haire, Hollihocke séedes, and Folefoote, of each two handfuls, Currans thrée handfuls, sixe Poppie heads, sixe ounces of fresh Butter, xxxvi. ounces of swéet sodden Wine, put vnto it (when all is well sodden and brayed) one dragme of Saf∣fron. A good salue. Take Althaea salue, and Butter, annoint the place therewith where the paine is, and strew thereon beaten Comin, and lay a warme Colewoort leafe thereon. When the Pleurisie taketh a woman with Child. §. 12. IF it then chaunce that a woman be in doubt of bearing the space of two mo∣neths, were brought a bed before her time, and brought a dead child into the world, or were much inclined to the same, and so be taken with the Pleurisie, she must not be let bloud, but she must haue cups set on her buttockes, and be picked well, whereby to draw the bloud downward. But women that are woont to miscarie in hast, they may well be let bloud, yet alwaies taking good héed to their strength. But for a generall rule, all women (albeit they miscarie or not, or that they haue conceiued) are to haue the liuer veine opened. But if it be not the right Pleurisie, then make a bagge with warme Millet and Bran, and lay it where the stitch is felt, and an∣noynt the backe with Althaea salue. But they that are not with child and haue the Pleurisie, it is much counselled, that their Termes be prouoked as much as is possible, whereof in the fift part is very largely discoursed. And the other (euen as is alreadie said) are to be holpen (according as they be of strength) by other medicines.
Rules for such as are recouered of the Pleurisie, that they fall not into it againe. §. 13. FIrst, all they that be subiect to this sicknesse, are to shun all dwellings (and prin∣cipally in winter season) that are situate in the North and West, and neare the water. They must also forbeare all tough slimie meates, and all that is made of dough, Chéese, Milke, and such like: also from vineger, sowre and sharpe, and all kind of tart things: Capers and Sallad oyle are also enemies vnto him. Item from all pottage, except of red and white Pease, and Beane broth, which be good for him; and dresse Hennes, Pullets, Veale and Pigeons with it. All cold fruites, as Apples, Peares, Chesnuts, &c. are hurtfull for him: but Figges and Raisins are very méete; sodden Colewoorts, and all sorts of Rapes and rootes, as Parsneps, Parsley rootes, and such like, are very good for him: and all Barley paps also. His drinke must be thin, white, and swéet wine, or common Béere which is very cleare. To drinke water, is for this streightly forbidden: but if the patient desire to water his wine he may doe it; yet with water that is decocted with Cinnamome or Licorice. After his meale tide is he to kéepe himselfe quiet one or two houres. Watching is very hurtfull for him: but to sléepe long is very good and néedfull. In eating, he must also beware of swallowing downe meate not well chewed, and of ouer∣charging his stomacke with meate and drinke, that there follow no harme to the stomacke. He must looke well to all these, and that he be alwaies merrie and of a light heart. Secondly, he must take good héede for to haue alwaies an open bodie; and before he vse these pils following, he must first vse these potions: Take of the water of Fole-foote fiue ounces: Su∣gar one ounce, drinke it euery morning fasting at one time. The pils are thus to be made: take prepared Aloe one quarter of an ounce, Opopanacum, Bdellium, and Colloquint, of each one scru∣ple, make pils thereof with sirupe of Roses sixe of a drag. then take euery foure dayes one or twaine, according as you are bound, and in the euening one before supper. A Salue. TAke Asarabacca, Hyssope, Mallowes, and Rosemarie, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Sandaraca three drag. Spica nardi one quarter of an ounce, Dragon bloud, and the iuice of Sloes, of each one drag. Starch fiue dragms; powne each apart as small as may be, then temper it with Malmsey, and kéepe this stopped tight: Herewith are you to rub the backe bone and shoulders softly, and afterwards a Foxe case bound theron. And the patient must haue his veine opened on the right hand besides the little finger, and let it bléede foure or fiue ounces of bloud. These are the most principall meanes, wherby these perillous sicknesses may be preuented: but we will adde somewhat more to the rest. Certaine seuerall remedies against the cold Pleurisie. §. 14. FOr the true Pleurisie do serue these compounded Confections and losinges: which are prepared two manner of wayes, Diaprassium, Diahyssopum, Diaire Solomonis, & Lohoch de Pino. Item all that is prepared against the cold cough, as confected Elecampane rootes, Treacle, Mithridate, swéete sirupe of Pomegra∣nates, and Parsley rootes sodden in wine, tempered with a little vineger, and thereof drunken often. Also M. Tristrams water, and other moe Aquae Compose. But by reason of the ague some cooling things must alwaies be tempered amongst it. For the common drinke you haue here before in the sixt §. a speciall Barley water: mollists crums of white bread therin bounden in a clout, straine it often out and mingle some white wine amongst it. Hony water quencheth thirst, it prouoketh also the tough humors & flegmes to auoide, and it is good for all coughes. Thin wine tempered with water is tolerable for this, if ye Ague be not too strong. Itē, take Cicera, Venus haire, as much as you please: let it séeth with
a little Licorice. For common things, these following are very good for the cold Pleurisie; as Assa foetida, Nettles with their séede, Balsam wood, with their fruites, Ireos, Myrrhe, the right Acornes, for which some do take Calmus, or great Galingall and Starch. The fifth Chapter. Of the Lights or Lungs. WE haue hitherto spoken of the outward parts of the Brest, and discoursed of their infirmities: now we will write of the inner parts, and will be∣gin with the Lights, for that they are made as a separation betwéene the pipes of the Lungs and the Hart; also as an instrument of the breath, or∣dained of God for the vse of the bodie, thereby to draw in the outward aire, thereby to coole and quicken the heart and all inward parts, where∣with to forme also and effect the voice and spéech in all that hath receiued life. Therefore hath nature made the substance of the Lights light, and like a sponge, formed with many pipes, wherby they might be the more méet to draw ye breath out and in. Some ancient Phisitions are of opinion, that they were without bloud; but it is not so, they haue their bloud too, and are full of it: but as soone as it commeth out of the Brests, the bodie is void thereof. What great difference is betwéene the Lights of men and of Beasts, is not here néedfull to be written. In like manner that the smaller the Lights be in ones bodie, the more swifter can they indeuour and bestirre themselues. This noble and necessarie member is subiect to many grieuous and deadly sicknesses, wher∣of we will speake hereafter: But first of all we will begin with the Cough. Of the Cough. §. 1. FOrasmuch as the Cough is a messenger of all the diseases of the Lights and of the Brest, and that through the grossenesse, drouth, moisture, spettle and other excre∣ments; whereby men may easily adiudge how the brest and lights are made with∣in: therefore it is aduised first of all to write thereof. The auncient Phisitions do write thus of the Cough: The Cough is a naturall motion of the Lights, the which by the aire and mouing vertue of the muscles that are within the Breast, is méete and made for to cough vp all that which hurteth the lights. The mouing and breathing in the breast is appropriated by nature; as the néesing for the braines, and the digesture for the stomacke. But before we go any further, we will speake first of the Rheume, the which prouoketh the cough most of all. Of the Rheume or Catarrhe which falleth vpon the Lights. §. 2. HEre before in the second part, the first Chapter, and 4. §. and afterwards in the description of the Squinancie, there are written many things of this Rheume of the lights, which may as well be vnderstood of the Rheume in the lungs as of the Squinancie. For the perill of stifling is euen as much, whether the lights were stopt, or ye throte were shut vp. Such things happen oftentimes through a tough slimie matter, which falleth out of the head vpon the lights, and into the breast, the which is very ill to be gotten out, and there resteth and abideth. We will therfore first shew by what means all such stoppings of the lights are to be remedied and cured. And for that these Rheumes are more incident to children, by reason of their moisture, therefore we will expresse certaine necessarie things that are requisite for the said young children. Take Lineséede which is beaten mollifie it in cleare honie, giue it to the child to lick thereof: it driueth out the slime, it separateth it, openeth the breast, and purgeth mildly, whereof giue him fiue or sixe times, according as it purgeth much or little: but if so be that the child will not eate any thing at all, then is there no hope of health to ensue. But then rost an Onion in
warme ashes, wring out the iuice, put thereto as much Hens and Capons grease as there is iuice, and temper it by a soft fire, and annoint the childs breast therewith. Item, take Mastick, Frankinsence, and Citron pils, of each a like much, and make thereof a powder, and rub the Child softly therewith aboue vpon the future of the Scull. Also you may let him lke oile of swéet Almonds, tempered with Sugar candie, for it mollifieth the breast, and looseth it. These losinges following are not onely very good for children, but for aged people, whether the same be vsed in losinges, or in forme of any confection, ℞. Agarici albi ℥. 18. Spec. Diambrae. ℥. 5. Diareos Solomonis, drag. 1. Spec. Diatragacanthi, scrup. 4. Polypodij quercint, ℥. 1. Omnia in puluerem redacta, cum Saccaro incorporentur ad placitum. But with men in yeares it hath another respect. They that be sixteene or eightéene yeares old, who are infected with this disease, they shall rule themselues according to this regiment following. Concerning the order of diet, you haue here before in the first Chapter and 4. §. and god aduice and instructions afterwards. Also, it is very good that the Liuer veine be opened, and fiue ounces of bloud letten out. Afterwards two scruples or one scruple of the pils Cochiae to be taken, and to sléepe one houre after them, and fiue houres after that to drinke a draught of su∣gred Barly water, and then to eate somewhat. This so done, he must vse this Potion follow∣ing warme in the morning: Take sirupe of Endiue, Honie of Roses, and sirupe of Stechas, of each halfe an ounce, water of Cicorie, and of Endiue, of each one ounce and a halfe, tempered together. But for this accident are Clisters more profitable, like as these be following, which are re∣cited and put for an example. Take Poppie heads, small Housleeke, Mallowes, and Bran, of each halfe a handfull, Asarabacca, and Betonie, of each halfe so much, seeth all together in suffi∣cient water, then wring it out well, and take of this decoction twelue or sixtéene ounces, oile of Violets and of Saffron, of each one ounce and a halfe, Hiera Picra, and S. Thomas Sugar, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Salt one quarter of an ounce: these Clisters are you to vse be∣fore noone. He may lay rosted Millet, with Salt and Cammomill vpon his head, and to set of∣tentimes cups or boxes vpon his shoulders and buttockes (without picking) is highly com∣mended. Or if that the partie be full of bloud, then ought they to be picked. Also if by nature he be subiect to the Piles, then ought they to be opened by rubbing with rough clothes or Figgs leaues; so also is the Oxe gall very good for them. Afterwards must he be washed euery day with sharpe Ley, and therefore vse conuenient Sope, and let him be well dried, continuing this ten dayes together, but in the meane time shall he take the pils Assaiaret, and refraine the cold ayre, and kéepe his head well couered. This Salue following is very commodious, if the shorne head be annointed therewith, it raiseth many blisters, and thereby draweth out all the moisture from the braines, and streng∣theneth the head excéedingly. Take one ounce of Nep, Beane meale, and Pease meale, of each thrée ounces, stamped roots of Costus and Mace, of each halfe an ounce, Mustard séed one dragm, Pigeon dung two ounces, Marioram gentle stamped thrée quarters of an ounce, séeth these together in sufficient water to pappe, and vse it as is said: for this purpose serueth also oile of Masticke. Item, take oile of sweet Almonds, and Hens grease, of each halfe an ounce, Saffron one scruple, and therewith annoynt the throate and the breast. To this end may also this sirupe following be prepared: take fiue Poppie heads with the séedes of panis diui Iohannis clensed from the kernels, one ounce and a halfe, Myrtle séeds halfe a dragme, prepared Licorice one ounce and a halfe, séeth them in a pint of water, vnto two parts, wring it out and straine it, and put afterwards therto Su∣gar candy, and Sugar pennets, of each two ounces, seeth it as thick an honie. And if the rheume fall vehemently on the breast, that it séemeth to strangle one, then take halfe an ounce of Agari∣cus, letting it stéepe 24. houres long in sixe ounces of the water of Venus haire, afterwards wring it out, and put as much Sugar vnto it as you please. And seeth it to the thicknesse of Hony for your daily vse, whereof is to be taken halfe an ounce at a time. If this Rheume come with heate, then make these pils following, and kéepe them one day and a night in your mouth. Take white Poppie séede, Purslaine séede, and Lettice séed, Sugar candie and Sugar pennets, of each one dragme, Saffron one scruple, and make them all to pils with dissolued Dragagant.
But if the Rheume be with cold and a great cough, then take red Stirax, Cipers nuts, Frankinsence, Laudanum, iuice of Licorice, and Amber, of each one dragm, Raisins (the stones taken out) one drag. and a halfe, Sugar candy three dragmes, make pils thereof with sirupe of Hyssope, and vse them as before. This powder following is approued for staying of the Rheume: Take Spica of the Indies one quarter of an ounce, Cinamome one quarter of an ounce, of the skull of a man that died through violence thrée quarters of an ounce: take euery time it commeth one drag. after meate in Wine, or any decoction. You may also make this in losinges with Sugar, or to a powder. Further, you may take and receiue a fomentation for this Rheume, as in the first part the third Chapter, and 2. §. Item, take Frankinsence and Sandaraca (which are very requisite for this,) the water of Consolida regalis is also very méete for this vse. Certaine auncient Phisitions do highly commend Barley water mixt with Iulep of Violets. Item, take cleare and wel washed Turpentine one quarter of an ounce, beaten Licorice one dragme: put thereto séething hote flesh broth, and stirre it still about vntill the Turpentine be dissolued, and drink it when you go to bed. Other do take also washt Turpentine, tempered with Hony, and beaten Licorice: both these are maruellous good, and specially if the patient therewith be troubled with the infirmity of grauell. Item, Hony and Vineger wherein Agaricus hath bene stéeped, taketh away all dan∣ger of choking. Likewise for this is very good the sirupe of gréene nut shels, which is described in the first part the thirtéenth Chapter, and 4. §. looke for it there. It is also here before often∣times mentioned, that as men will go to bed, they are to swallow three or foure grains of Fran∣kinsence, for that they do strengthen much the braines, and do drie and stay cold Rheumes. If so be that through this Rheume the Pleurisie is feared, the which is thereby oftentimes caused, then take foure ounces of new made oyle of Almonds, and small filed bones of a Bore ten graines, tempered together, and so giuen the patient to drinke. And if so be that through all the aforesaid remedies the Rheume be not remoued, then do the learned giue counsell for the last meane, which is to cauterize on the seame of the skull, the which any may do very well, if one be afraid that the patient be in danger of stifling. What is commodious for the obstructed Lights. §. 3. FOR the obstruction of the lightes (which prouoketh the cough, the shortnesse of breath, and many other diseases) is all that highly commended which causeth to rid much phlegme, like as hereafter more amply (where we shall speake of the Cough) you shall sée: yet are these things following vsed against this present stopping, to wit, conserue of Fumitorie, and all that is made of that herbe: it o∣peneth the obstructions of all parts. In like manner, Conserues of Marioram gentle, Sage, oyle of bitter and swéet Almonds, oyle of Wormwood, sirupe of Violets, of Vineger, and Ace∣tosus compositus, which do separate and loose these Rheumes that are impacted in the Lights. In like sort Oxymel of Squils, and Agaricus, haue a speciall operation for to loose all tough phlegme from the lights, for which this confection following is highly commended: Take Frankinsence Myrrhe, Licorice, Saffron, and Cassie wood, of each one dragme, beaten small together, and Hony (sodden with Malmsey somewhat thicke) foure ounces, tempered all together. This con∣fection is speciall good for this maladie. But euery one ought to know whether this Rheume do procéed either of heate or of cold, thereby to rule and direct himselfe, and may make choice of medicines that may be commodious as well for the one as the other. Remedies for the Cough. §. 4. WHat the Cough is, and how it is described of the learned, is declared before in the 1. §. But as much as concerneth the inconuenience of the Cough, we will diuide it into two sorts, to wit, a drie and a cold sort, both proceeding either of inward or outward causes. The outward are, when as any thing commeth into the throte, be it powder, dust, any pestilent ayre, or any other bad ayre, dry, moist, or hote ayre, wherewith the Lights be infected.
In like maner smoke, sharpe meates drest with Pepper or much Salt, Medlars, Vineger, Veriuice, Limons, or such like, which passeth through the throte, be it through meate or drinke, which do slide into the vnright throte (as the common people vse to say.) The inward causes are tough slime, and rheumes, (whereof before hath bene written) that fall into the breast and the stomacke. And when any vapors come into the Lights, be it of an infirmity of the stomacke, Milt, Liuer, Mother, and such like: the which infirmities bring with them their owne signes, and shew whereof they spring and sprout, which would be too long to be rehearsed at this pre∣sent. But to come to the remedies of both these sorts of the Cough, it is to be marked, whether the Cough be drie or no; for when it is so, then commeth it of heate: And if so be that the patient be ful of bloud and red in the face, then according to the permission of his age, of the countrie, of the time, he is to be let bloud without delay, especially if the party be dry and leaue. But if it last long, it is to be feared that it will come to a consumption (which is Phthisis.) For this are good all cooling and moist things, as conserue of Violets, stewed Barley (which is Ptisana) and such like things. Against all drie Coughes. §. 5. THat which at the first of the stewed Barley and other things hath bene said, the same is also good for this drie Cough, whereas little or nothing at all is coughed vp: But this drinke is especially commended for it. Take sirupe of Violets, sirupe of Poppie heads, and sirupe of Iuiubes, of each a like much, water wherin Bar∣ley, Violets, Licorice, Raisins, and Sebestes be sodden, as much as you thinke good, tempered with Sugar. Purging is not onely commodious, but also néed∣full, the which is thus to be effected: Take of the said decoction, séeth therin Prunes of Damas, and sower Dates, of each halfe an ounce, pilled Melon séede, Pompion séede, Cucumber séede, Gourd seedes, and Venus haire, of each one quarter of an ounce; take foure ounces thereof, and temper therein one ounce and a halfe of Cassi, for it cooleth and openeth. The auncient Phisi∣tions do praise pilled Beanes; it is possible indéed, for that it will make the water thicke. In like maner do they commend fresh Butter wherin Almonds and Sugar are mixed, stewed Gourds, Iuiubes, Spinage, Endiue, Lettice, Purslaine, oile of swéet Almonds, Kids flesh, Pullets, and such like. It is also good that the patient alwaies keepe somewhat in his mouth, sometimes one thing and otherwhiles another, to wit, losinges of Dragagant, Sugar pennets, Licorice, the iuice of Licorice, Sugar candy, or such like: and for this you may prepare this confection following: ℞. Specierum, Diapapauere vnciam vnam, Diatragacanthi frigidi, Diapenidionis sine speciebus,  dragmam vnam, Sacchari violarum vncias duas, Species Diaireos vnciam vnam, fiat mixtura. Or take that which followeth: Take Poppie séede beaten small one ounce and a quarter, Starch, Dra∣gagant, and Gum, of each halfe an ounce, pilled séedes of Gourds and of Quinces, of each thrée dragmes; then make thereof a powder. Item, take Sugar pennets sixteene ounces, séeth it with water of Folefoote vnto the thicknes of honie, or somewhat stiffer, and take thereof often∣times in the mouth. Item, take a little pan, and frie Currans therein, stirring them still about, that they burne not; and eate thereof euery morning a full spoonefull. Item take halfe an ounce of Manna, dissolue it in fresh oyle of sweet Almonds, if there be any drest therin, strain them tho∣rough oftentimes. For this also is meete a bath of faire water, wherein are decocted Violets, Mallowes, and Hollihocke rootes. Because that this kind of drie Cough hath neede of moisture and mellowing potions, for which these things are noted downe: Take of the blacke losinges, and temper them with the sirupe of Violets, and with the foresaid decoction, and drink therof as often as you wil, it is mar∣uellous good. And you may also vse it with the sirupe alone. Item, take new milke, temper it with sweet butter and sugar, and drinke when you go to sleepe, it easeth the Cough aboue all measure. Or take foure pints of water, and the fourth part of a pint of honie, sixe Figs cut smal, one ounce of Licorice, seeth them together vnto a pint, scum it well, and drinke thereof euery morning a good warme draught, and delay also the patients wine therewith. This is also mar∣uellous good against all hoarsnesse.
Another. Temper faire Well water with any of these sirupes following, and drinke there∣of, to wit, with sirupe of Violets, of Poppie heads, or of water Lillies. Item, take Barly wa∣ter one pint, séeth therein foure or fiue Crabs, according as they be big, or in their stead hedge Snailes, for they are speciall good against all drie Coughes. This potion following is called at the Apothecaries Decoctio pectoralis,The pectoral decoction. and is much vsed and had in all the Apothecaries shops at Ausborough, and also very commodious: for it scoureth the stomacke, melloweth the Cough, cleanseth the tough slime in the breast, and moisteneth al∣so the same. Take new Figs half an ounce, Dates and Iuiubes, of each one quarter of an ounce, Mallowes, Hyssope, Currans, sliced Licorice, Annis séede, Fennell séeds, and Barly, of each one quarter of an ounce; séeth them all together in thrée pints of Barley water vnto the second part: but if there be much flegmaticke slime with it, then let there be sodden therewith one ounce or twaine of Honie. The like remed haue you also here before in the second Chapter, and the se∣cond §. Of that which may be vsed outwardly. TAke Cammomils alone, or with Roses and Thime sodden together, and receiue the vapor or fume thereof into your nose. Hereafter follow diuers Salues, and such like. TAke the muscilage of Dragagant, and of Gumme, of each one quarter of an ounce, oile of swéet Almonds, and of Violets, of each one ounce, Hens grease and Calues marrow, of each halfe an ounce, Waxe as much as is néedefull to make a salue. Or take oile of Violets foure ounces, as much white waxe as will make it thicke, spread thereof vpon a cloth, and then lay it vpon the breast. Item, take the muscilage of Lineséede, and of Hollihock rootes, oyle of Lillies, and Goosegrease, of each halfe an ounce, Saffron ten grains, and a little molten Waxe: make a soft salue of them, and therewith annoint the whole breast. This is speciall good for young children, and not vnprofitable for people in yeares. The things hereafter following are excéeding good to annoint therewith the breast, if so be it be vsed alone, or tempered with o∣ther things, like as the oile of Cammomils, oile of yellow and blew Violets, oile of Lillies, and Poppie heads. Item, all fat of Hens and Ducks, of which two fats take one ounce, of Saffron one scruple tempered together, and the breasts annointed therewith. There are at the Apothecaries two kinds of brest salues, which are called Vnguenta Pectora∣lia: Take muscilage of Fleawoort, Dragagant, Gumme, Linséede, and Fenegréeke séede, of each one dragme, Hens grease, marrow of Calues bones, fresh Butter thrée quarters of an ounce, washed together with the water of Violets, oile of swéet Almonds, and of Violets, of each halfe an ounce, Waxe as much as néede requireth, and so tempered all together into a salue. This swageth not only the Cough, but also all paines of the breast. Another. Take oile of Violets two ounces, oile of swéet Almonds one ounce and a halfe, fresh Butter two ounces, Ducks grease one ounce, Muscilage of Hollihocke rootes, Linséede and Fenegréeke, of each halfe an ounce, let these seeth all together vntill that the muscilage be consumed. Take molten white Waxe as much as is néedfull for a salue, but stirre it well about vntill it be cold: this hath the same operation with the other. Of a moyst and cold Cough. §. 6. VVHen the Cough commeth with much slime and moisture, and will not be remo∣ued, and that therewith be no Ague nor Lask, then are these losinges following to be giuen him, with water wherein Ʋenus haire and Hyssope is sodden. Take Fen∣nell séede, Smallage seed, iuice of Licorice, Ʋenus haire, and péeled Almonds, of each a like much, make trocisces or losinges thereof with the muscilage of Linséede. You are also to prepare these Sirupes following, which are passing good. Take Ireos and Elecampane rootes, of each one ounce and a halfe, Hyssope and Venus haire, of each two handfuls, white Mints, Pimpernell, Mallowes, Marioram, of each halfe a handfull, fried Linséed one ounce, raw Barly one ounce and a halfe, Licorice & Currans, of each
two ounces, Hony and Sugar, of each sixe ounces, make of them a sirupe. For this is also méet the vsuall sirupe of Licorice, also Stechados, Oxymel of Squils, and sirupe of Venus haire three or foure dayes one after another, with water of Venus haire or Scabious drunken. When as then the matter is prepared with the foresaid things, then purge the patient with pils Cochiae and Aureae, of each halfe a drag. Or take one ounce of Cassie, Agaricus one drag. and a halfe, Turbith also one dragme, Sal gemmae and Ginger, of each three graines: giue it him with foure ounces of water, wherein are sodden Venus haire, Hyssope, Scabious, Licorice, and Violets. After purging, some do giue Mithridate and Treacle for old coughes, thereby to consume the matter. Also for old Coughes the Treacle Diatessaron is to be vsed, but take what you please giuing him a dragme at one time, according as the person is young or old, with a little Barly water. The Breast is also to be kept warm, and the same to be annointed, wherto this follow∣ing serueth: Take Muscilage of Fenegréeke, and Lineseede, of each two ounces, fresh butter one quarter of an ounce, oile of swéet Almonds one ounce and a halfe, Waxe as much as is néedful. For this is speciall good the salue Althea, and when you haue rubbed the brest warme therwith, then couer it with carded shéepes wooll. Further, these things may be vsed outwardly: to wit, that in the morning there be laid on his head a bag of parched Millets and salt, or a bag with Penniroyall, Marioram, and Mints laid vpon the head: Or in the steade therof, Styrax, wild Mints, Myrrhe, & Sandaraca, of each a like much beaten to powder, and cast vpon the fire, and the vapor or fume thereof receiued into the nose and mouth. For this is also good Nigella seede, or Sandaraca, each alone. Item, take Rose∣marie, Penniroyall, Cammomill, white Mints, and Sage, of each a like quantitie: let them séeth together, and receiue the vapor or fume. You may make also of these things following a cap, and weare the same continually on the head: it is very commodious for old folke. Take Stechas, Amaranthus, Cammomill, Melilot, Agnus castus, and Rue, of each a handfull and a halfe, Annis seede, Fennell, Comin, prepared Coriander, of each halfe an ounce: then lay this Cap vpon a hote stone, which is sprinkled with wine, and so set it warme on his head. The patient is also to hold Myrrhe a long time in his mouth, and afterwards swallow it downe, for it hath a maruellous operation in all cold coughes. A bath to wash the feete is also very commodious for this: take for the same Thime, Roses, Cammomils, and Salt, of each one handfull: let them seeth together, and put the feete therein euen to the knées. This may he vse thrée dayes long, and then renew the same. Other things moe that are very requisite for this purpose. FOr this is also good all that warmeth the breast, whereof there are many sortes, as two kinds of Diireos, the which in the first part, the 14. Chapter §. 1. are described: Likewise Diatragacanthum calidum, which is also there described in the 2. §. Meade is also very go against the cold Cough, and all diseases of the Lights, which is taught to be prepared diuersly in the eighth part. What pectorall potions the Apothecaries haue in vse, the same is shewed is the second part, the second chapter, and 2. §. Elecampane wine taketh away all cold diseases of the brest. The same doth also oyle of Lillies, of swéet Almonds, oile of Poppy heads, trocisces of Diapenidion, Looch de Pino, which is a confection of Pine apple kernels, Looch sanum, & chiefly Looch de Scilla, tosted Figs, Dates, the decoction of an old Cock, with wild Saffron seed, wherin Hyssop, Ireos, Raisins or Nettle séeds is decocted. Elecampane, Saffron and all that is prescri∣bed for the cold rheume. And because that these Losinges, Looch, or confections are many times rehearsed in this our booke of Phisicke, therfore it cannot be misaduised that we describe them and other such like here,Diapenidion. and begin first with Diapenidion, which is made thus. Take Sugar pen∣nets two ounces, swéet and bitter Almonds, and white Poppie séede, of each thrée dragmes and one scruple, Cinamome, Cloues, Ginger, iuice of Licorice, Dragagant, Starch, Gum, seedes of Melons, of Gourds, and Cucumbers, all pilled, of each one drag. and a halfe, Camfere seuen graines, make thereof small powder being al beaten and chopt, and with an ounce of this pow∣der, 12. ounces of Sugar, and séeth it away with water of Folefoote vnto losinges, and then let it melt in your mouth. This Sugar is very good for al old coughes, for hoarsnesse, for digestion, and coughing vp of phlegme.
Looch de Pino is thus prepared: Take fresh Pingles fiftéene dragmes,Looch de Pino. stéepe them all a night in the water of Folefoote, swéet Almonds, parched hasell Nuts, Dragagant, Gumme, Licorice, Starch, Ʋenus haire, and Ireos, of each one quarter of an ounce, 17. or 18. Dates, one ounce and a half of bitter Almonds, Hony of Roses, fresh Butter, and white Sugar, of each one quar∣ter of an ounce, 18. ounces and thrée quarters of clarified Hony, cut and powne all that is to be cut and powned, and then temper them togither with the sayd Hony, this is passing good for all cold Coughs. There is also another Looch or confection,Looch Sanum & expertum. the which is called Sanum & exper∣tum, which is haill and approued. Take Cinnamom, Hyssope, and Licorice, of each one quarter of an ounce, Iuiubes and Sebestes, of each fiftéene, Currans, Figs, and Dates, of each one ounce, Fenegréeke two ounces and a halfe, Venus haire halfe a handfull, Annis seede, Fennell, Ireos, Linseede, and white Mints, of each one quarter of an ounce, séeth them togither in 24. ounces of water vnto the halfe part, then straine it out, and put to this decoction twelue ounces of Sugar pennets, seeth this togither againe vntill it be through thicke, afterwards mingle the other things therein cut and beaten small, prepared Pingles one ounce and a quarter, as is afore sayd, peeled Almonds, iuice of Licorice, Dragagant, Gumme and Starch, of each one quarter of an ounce, rootes of Violets one dragme, stir them well togither vntill it be white. It is very good against the Cough and hoarsenesse that commeth of cold: it melloweth and emptieth the breast of all phlegmatick matter. Looch de Scylla which is of Squils, is very forcible to cleanse the Cough, slime,Looch de Scyl∣la. and phlegme out of the brests, and to separate the same: it swageth all paine and smart of the brest, and it may be thus prepared: Take the very best and purest part of a Squill parted asunder with a wooden knife, stampe it with a wooden pestell, and wring out the iuice: take so much Hony as there is iuice, and seeth it togither vntill it be thicke inough. Of an old Cough. §. 7. IF the Cough be waxen old, and so fierce that it will not let one sleepe, then doth Rasis ordaine to take Myrrhe, Styrax, and Opium, of each a like quantity, and to make pils thereof, and take one or two of them. It is often shewed before how hurtfull the Opium is, whereby euery man may know how to deale therewith: this following is safer: Take Syrupe of Poppy heads halfe an ounce, or more, or eate a little Poppie séed with Sugar, both of them make the Rheume thick, and do stay the same that falleth into the breast. Item, take a handfull of Hyssope, cut Licorice, and Currans, of each thrée ounces, Fenegréeke and Linséed, of each one ounce and a half, beate them and seeth them in two pintes of water vntill two parts remaine, couer the pot with a funnell, and receiue the vapour or reke in at the mouth. And for that the Cough is very a common disease, therfore wil it not be amisse briefly to com∣prehend what things are cōmodious for this Cough. First, if it proceede of heate, then are good for it the Violets and Sebestes, Dragagant, Gumme of Arabi, Starch, white Poppy seedes, Iu∣iubes, Mulberies, muscilage of Barley, of Fleawort, of Quince seeds, péeled Melon séeds, Gourd séeds, Cucumbers séeds, Purslaine, Endiue, Lettice, Melons, Almonds, Sugar pennets, oyle of Violets, of water Lillies, and such like. Conserues of water Lillies do coole and moysten the breasts, the throate and the tongue, and chiefly the sirupe of swéete Pomegranats. If the Cough proceedeth of cold (and if it be growne old) then are these things following very profitable, hasell Nuts, with Hony, do ripen the Cough, Smallage, Hyssop Venus haire, Mallowes, Scabious, Betony, wild Thime, white Mints, Marioram, great and small water Mints, and Chamedrios: of roots, Licorice, Ireos, Squils, Lillies, Elecampane, the rootes of blew Floure deluce, Garlike, boyled Calmus, Seseli, Pease, Fenegreeke seedes, Nettle seede, Annis seede, and Fennell seede, Linseede, seeds of Ʋerbascum péeled, and séeds of Hollihocks, which are both good in heate and cold. Of Fruites, Figs, Dates, Bayberies, Raisins, sweete and bitter Almonds prepared with Starch, are speciall good for all Coughes, sweete oyle, Pingles, sweete Pomegranats, & Iuiubes. Of all Spices is very commodious Pepper, Cinnamom, Saffron, and Cardamome. Further also of Gummes Bdellion, Assa foetida, Myrrha, Galbanum, Mastix, Sa∣gapenum, Sartocolla: Likewise Sulphur, Hony, Sugar, and all that is sweete, Sugar pennets, Sugar candie, Agaricus, Hony combs, swallowed downe or mixed with salues, and fine Bolus.
Of Compositions, are Losinges, Barley water, many Confections, Sirupes, and Manus Christi, whereof one that hath vnderstanding and knowledge, is to make choice of such as he shall see to be requisite for the cause. In like manner is highly commended for this the Conscrues of Rosemary: all Oxymels are good for the Cough, specially they that haue Agaricus in them: notwithstanding in grieuous Coughs is to be vsed the aduice of a learned Phisition. For the Cough in children Bathing is hurtfull: the drinke of their Nurses shall be water and Sugar. Also it is very good for to put al∣waies Sugar, or the powder of Licorice in their pap. All sowre things are ill, and contrary to the Cough, as Vineger, Veriuice, all sowre drinkes and meates, and all that is cold of nature, or in any wise sharpe, are streightly forbidden. What ordinance or gouernment of life is to be obserued (be it in cold or hote Agues) you may see aboue in the second part, the second Chapter, and 2. §. where it is at length described. But this is only yet to be therewith annexed, that all moist phlegmaticke Coughes, whether they procéede of heate or cold, reasonable walking, standing, and watching, is most méete, by reason that the matter which causeth the Cough, doth alwaies fall more into the breast sleeping than waking. What is good for coughing vp of Phlegme. §. 8. ALbeit we haue told here before what raiseth the Phlegme, and is commodious for the loosing thereof, yet can it not be but expedient to rehearse here againe certaine of the forementioned things, and to adde other remedies moe thereto, whereby the phlegme might be furthered and brought vp. The Sirupe of Licorice is one of the most precious remedies for the Cough: after that the sirupe of Horehound, De Prassio, and of Hyssope, De Hyssopo. If there be much tough phlegme at hand, then is Oxymel to be tempered and drunken with Barley water. Waters of Folefoote and Elecampane are passing good and forcible to loose phlegme: likewise Manna, and Sugar pennets. Will you then haue good Tabulates for this? then take Starch, péeled Melon séede, Gourd séede, Cucumber séed, and Pompeon seed, of each (being all péeled) halfe an ounce, Dragagant and Gumme, of each three quarters of an ounce, Licorice one quarter of an ounce, Sugar pen∣net two ounces, Saffron foure graines, Sugar candy two ounces, Violets one quarter of an ounce, séedes of white Sesamum halfe an ounce, of the sirupe of Violets twelue ounces, dissolue the Sugar therein vntill that you (with other things therein tempered) may cast Tabulates. If you will make a confection thereof, (like as it will best frame vnto it) then seeth not the Su∣gar too hard. And you are to annoint the breast with these things following: Take Duckes grease one ounce, fresh Butter halfe an ounce, oile of Sesamum and of Violets, one ounce and a halfe, Saf∣fron one scruple, Grayes grease and Waxe, of each thrée quarters of an ounce: melt them toge∣ther, and wash it twice with Barly water wherin some Saffron is sodden, then mingle Saffron amongst it, which is then put amongst it because it is speciall good for the brest, for all manner of coughes and heauie breath, therefore is it to be vsed at all times in their meate. Will you haue the salue more maturating? then temper amongst it the muscilage of Sesa∣mum, and Fenegréeke, of each one ounce, with a little molten Waxe. And if so be that the belly, the fundament, the priuities, and all parts round about them be annointed with it, then wil all Rheumes be stayed therewith. Item, the breast annointed with the salue Althea, ripeneth Phlegme, and riddeth it very much. The like doth also the pectorall vnguent described in the end of the 5. §. In like manner also a stomachicall powder, which is expressed in the first part the 13. Chapter and 1. §. of the Memorie, the which is also good for the Cough, and for the Lights. Item, M. Tristrams water, and many other remedies that are also discouered before in the sixt §. And for that there is written much of the Rheume or Catarrhe before, whereof the said Cough is moued, and there is likewise much herafter to be said also of the shortnesse of breath, the which infirmities are to haue one and the selfe same kind of remedies: therfore we will pro∣céede now and speake of other maladies which the Breasts and Lights are subiect vnto, and how they are best to be cured.
Of a short panting Breath. §. 9. OF this heauie and panting breath hath bene mentioned before: that the lights are by nature ordained an instrument, dwelling place, and distributors of the breath, therefore (albeit they be subiect to many diseases) yet can there not a more daunge∣rous accident happen vnto any, than that the breath be hindered, or cannot be drawne or yeelded foorth againe, for that whensoeuer this chaunceth, then will the affected par∣tie be quickly choked. Yet doth it come to passe oftentimes, that if any do get a short panting breath, of which if he be not soone rid, death must needes ensue; therefore are all Phisitions full of care and trouble in the cure of the same. And whereas this maladie procéedeth of many kinds of causes, therefore haue the Phisiti∣ons giuen it many kinds of names, and specially the Grecians, which difference we are also (as much as is possible) for to imitate and follow. That we may therfore first speake of the pursiuenesse or shortnesse of the breath, and whence the same procéedeth, we will indéede first of all describe three sorts of pursiuenesse, as Dyspnaea, Asthmaea, and Orthopnaea. Dyspnaea is, when the breath is drawne painfully and out of course, and therfore all that are so affected be called Dyspnaeici, who do draw their breath with great labor through the narrow∣nesse of the breast and of the lights, and they are more troubled in drawing it in, than in letting the same out againe. Asthma is an vneasie drawing of breath, where there is more griefe in letting out the breath than in taking of it in, so that this hapneth with a strong wheasing and noise, yea with such nar∣rownesse of the breast, that it séemeth that the partie would thereby yéeld vp the ghost, and de∣part this world. Orthopnaea hath both these accidents, that commeth commonly so strong, that the sick person (if he be as féeble as he may) must yet notwithstanding be alwayes vpright for feare of stifling: and these persons do find indéede, that when they are vpright, then they draw their breath in, and let it out the easier: so that Dyspnaea is caused only through the féeblenesse of the drawing in of the breath; Asthma, for lacke of this force that ought to driue out the superfluous vapors out of the lights, and Orthopnaea, where that there wanteth vigor to draw the breath in, and againe to let it out. But these thrée infirmities of the Lights are very nigh of condition the one to the other, yet haue they their seuerall signes from what humors they procéede, which are chiefly caused of bloud and phlegme, but lesse of Cholera, and very seldome of Melancholia. The cause of this pur∣siuenesse may proceed as well of outward cold, as of vnnaturall heate, as also of falling, thru∣sting, and striking, whereby any of the inward parts of the throte be tainted or pained, as Si∣newes, Arteries, Muscles, Necke, and such like, ioyntly or particularly, whereby the breath is hindered, euen as the same may be prouoked by some sudden strong stirring of the body, pesti∣lent aire, vapor or damp of Quicksiluer. The inward causes are phlegmaticke matter through∣out the whole body, or in any part thereof the which for the most part infecteth the head and the lights, long and continuall vse of any choking and binding things. Item, if there were any im∣postume in any part about the breast, as in the throte, pipe of the lights, as in the Squinancie, paine of the stomack, suffocation of the mother, and such like. Also when as any Rheume falleth into the lights, which is comprehended vnder the foresaid parts. The outward causes must be vnderstood by the patient himselfe, to wit, whether he haue led an vnruly life, whether he haue eaten much fruite, much Swines flesh, much Beefe, or haue bene fed with much Veriuice, Vineger, Medlars, or Chestnuts, all which do bréede a short breath: but if this shortnes of breath do come of the Squinācie, looke for the signes of the same, and likewise for other incident sicknesses, as for the signes of the Pleurisie, inflammation of the lights, suffocation of the mother, superfluitie of phlegme, euen as of either of them is sufficient∣ly spoken in his place. Concerning the remedies for these sicknesses, we will first of all shew in what manner the patient is to behaue himselfe, for that helpeth much, and chiefly, for that these diseases do many times so mooter and plague people (for the space of many yeares) that they can neither liue nor
die. Because then this pursiuenesse, coughes, and shortnesse of breath are caused of all humors of a mans bodie, which is bloud, Cholera, Phlegma, and Melancholia: therefore we will for bre∣uitie sake, declare no certaine rule of liuing, to the end that euery one of discretion might know to rule himselfe according to the nature of euery patient, and other circumstances, as also by many other instructions that are described here and there in this booke. Notwithstanding to frame an introduction thereto, this is the beginning. If in case that this pursiuenesse procéede of tough flegme that obstructeth the brest, you shall know it by this, to wit, if the patient be pla∣gued with a grieuous and pinching shortnes of breath, and that most at all times when as this tough slime shall be remoued, to wit, two houres after midnight, euen vntill the morning. And if that he through want of sléepe, can scant come to himselfe through weaknesse of wit, with a strange pleasant tast of his mouth, and casting out of salt flegme, whereby that the foote and the eyes waxe bleake, the breast is without heate, or with very little: yet the breast being bur∣thened with a grieuous Cough and short breath; thereto commeth also a heauie fraighted head, lithernes of the whole bodie, a slow, féeble, and sometimes also a still pulse. And if the matter which is impacted in the breast be stirred, then trembleth the patient: yet with these other signes moe are many alterations, which are incident vnto them, according to the importance of the Ague, as it commeth to passe. Of the sixe vnnaturall things, which are called Res non naturales, whereto is also added a rule of diet for the Pursiuenesse. §. 10. IN the Introduction of this booke of Phisicke, in the eleuenth Chapter, is a briefe discourse of these sixe vnnaturall things, the which the learned call Non natura∣les, wherof we then promised to speak more at large. And to the end this may be orderly effected, therfore are we to speake somewhat therof at large; and to that end, because the same is very commodious for many sicknesses already mentio∣ned, and others that are yet to be described hereafter. But these are not therfore called vnnaturall, because they are contrarie or besides nature: for sléeping, watching, &c. are not contrarie vnto nature, but onely by reason they haue not receiued their naturall ofspring of bloud, Cholera, Phlegma, and Melancholia, wherewith the nature of man is vnited and ioyned together: and when they agree orderly together nature wil be supported by them, especially for that they are but accidentall things, that are not nature her selfe, but be the furtherers and pre∣seruers of the same: and by reason thereof haue gotten these names, as followeth. Aire.The Ayre is of the learned decréed for the first, wherein they that haue a short breath are to obserue this rule; to wit, that men are for the same to chuse a subtill, warme, and drie Ayre. Contrariwise, men are to shun the cold and moist, and chiefly the South wind, for that often∣times is an occasion of a narrow breast or pursiuenesse. But if you cannot get such an ayre, then make fire in your chamber of Iuniper wood, and of a Bay trée, Cypers wood, Béechē wood, Oken wood, and such like. Item make a fume with Myrrhe, Laudanum, Ambra, Musk, and red Styrax, thrée ounces; temper them all together in Sage, wild Thime, Penniroyall, and all maner of odoriferous herbes. Or if one be kept in a Stoue, the same must be made but méetely warme. All places next to the earth, & all vaulted chambers must he refraine. The windowes of his chamber must stand towards the East and North, the which in the heate of the morning vntill noone are to be kept open, and afterwards shut vp; and when the Sun beginneth to go downe, then to open the same againe, thereby to refresh the aire. All dwellings that stand beside still standing pooles, are to be auoyded. In like manner also all darke, cloudie, thick, and stinking ayre. And when you are to go abroad, then is the Poman∣der following to be caryed in your hand, and smelt to continually. Take Spica of Indy, Ga∣lingall, and Mace, of each one dragme, Laudanum halfe an ounce, Frankinsence, Sandaraca, of each halfe a dragm, Muske and Ambra, of each two scruples, make thereof a Pomander with Malmsey. Looke also that the chamber of his dwelling be strewed with hearbes of hote natures: but from Rue and Smallage let him beware, for that they hurt the braines. Or sprinkle often the chamber with wine wherein the same hearbes are sodden. Motion.Motion: Motus is accounted the second vnnaturall thing: touching this is commaunded in the straightnes of the breast, that whensoeuer any such do rise in the morning, that he shall go
forthwith and ease himselfe, and beware how he weare any clothes that are narrow about the neck and breast: yet must he weare clothes well lyned, but no lyning of any Beasts that fre∣quent the water, or of Wolues. He must also not weare any heauy thing on his head; yet must he sée that his head be wel couered alway, and defended from the cold, with a light Cap or Hat. He must also giue himself to méetely stout walking, or to ride vpon an easie trotting horse, or to shoote in a handbow, or vse such like exercises. In the euening one houre before, and one houre after meate, shall he exercise himselfe, yet not aboue his abilitie, so that the short breath be not mooued too much, wherewith Venerie is also comprehended, for that it is a deadly poyson to a full stomack, by reason that the same ought to be done sixe houres after meales. But if these ex∣ercises cannot be atchieued by reason of great féeblenesse and other occasions, then in stead of them the patient is to be well rubbed with hote clothes ouer all his outward or vtmost parts, euen as the same is sufficiently taught in the second part of the first Chapter and §. 3. and in o∣ther places. This rubbing may be also well effected with oyle of Cammomill, Dill, or with Sallad oyle, and in such manner that if the shortnesse of breath be extreame, then in the begin∣ning is he to be futhed, and rubbed mightily, and afterwards very midly: and this is all to be done in such sort as the patient may well abide and suffer it. If there be great weaknesse approching, then let his clothes be fumed with Muske, Amber, Cinnamom, Lignum Aloes, Gallia Muscata, and such like: or lay on those parts certaine clothes which haue bene wetted in Malmsey, or any other kinde of Wine, wherein Cloues, Galingall, Mace, Spica, &c. are decocted. Sleepe and watching are sayd to be the third vnnaturall thing. And for this sicknesse is com∣maunded that men giue themselues to stéepe at any hand, be it at noone or euening,Sleepe. but onely two houres after meate: but it is better that one vtterly forbeare sleeping a dayes: seuen or 8. houres long is the fittest time for sleeping, yet the same may be diminished or augmented according to the custome of the sicke body; or his diet. First they are to lye high with their heads, and on the right side, vntill the digesture of the stomacke be consummated: and after∣ward awhile on the left side, and then againe on the right side, and to lye vpon the belly is com∣modious for digesture, but it is not good for the eyes. To lye vpon the backe is most perilous, and a cause of all diseases of the braines, the Sinewes, the Palsey, the Frenzie, and such like, because that therby all superfluitie of the humors do fall downe backwards: contrariwise, mea∣surable watching strengtheneth much, yet according to the importance and custome of nature, and power of all naturall humidities; for if one take not heede thereto, then commeth none o∣ther thereof, then all mishap. How that all excessiue watching shall be withstood, is to be seene in the first part the 12. Chapter, and 6. §. Repletion and inanition are the fourth vnnaturall things, which the Latinists do call Reple∣tionem,Repletion & mation. and Inanitionem. You must haue an especial care that the body be kept free from all super∣fluous humors, for thence do grow many & sundry infirmities, wherefore it is necessary that they be expelled in the morning through going to the stoole, through the vrine and sweating, & by all other such like meanes. And if so be that nature cause not all this of it self then ought it to be compassed through the helpe of stronger meanes: and first to begin with the easiest remedies, that is, with meate and drinke, but if the same cannot be perfected, then must other things be vsed according to the qualitie of the disease: but what serueth best for the grief in the breast (whereof we here do treate) shall be shewed hereafter. The first part of the foresaid vnnaturall things is called of the learned Accidentianimi,Affections of the minde. which are things that concerne the minde, as anger, rage, weeping, frightednesse, feare, heauinesse of the minde, sorrow, and such like, whereof also procéede great sicknesses, and thereby this disease of the breast is specially increased, for that thereby are the tough phlegme in the breast drawne, and the bringing of them vp hindred, therefore are all such sicke folkes to be alwayes merry and of good cheare. The sixt and last part and vnnaturall thing is meate and drinke,Meate and drinke. of which all is to be chosen that is good, & to forbeare all that is hurtfull. For that it is a generall rule, that those so infected are neuer to be ouerladen with meate and drinke. Also it is better that such do moderate them∣selues, taking at thrée times but a little, than at one time or two times to ouercharge them∣selues with meate and drinke. Secondly, that they swallow not downe the meate vnchewed. Thirdly, they that haue a griefe in their breast, are to forbeare eating of all that is cold, moyst,
slimie, and astringent of nature, as vnleauened bread, sodden fish, béefe, inwards, and féete of all beasts: also Milke, Chéese, & all that is drest with Milke, Lettice, Purslaine, Béets, Spinage, &c. may he not eate. Meates that be good for him, are well raised white bread which is not aboue thrée dayes old, and bread wherein Annis séede, Licorice, Saffron, Cinamome, and Fennell are baked. Of flesh is to be chosen good Mutton, Veale, Lambe, Kids, Hares, Conies, Roe buckes, and the lungs of a Foxe. Of Foules these are very commodious, Hens, Pullets, Capons, yong Pigeons, Phesants, Partriches, Blackbirds, wild Ducks rather boiled than rosted. Also there be good for him Broths, Coleworts, Parsly, Fennell, Mints, Sage, and Hyssop, which are to be vsed often, but Turneps and Spinage very seldome: drie Figs, Raisins, and Currans eaten be∣fore dinner and supper are much commended. And his meate is to be drest with Fennell séedes, Annis seede, Comine, Carawayes, Pepper, and such like things moe. Pease porredge & Beane broth is also good for him to vse: likewise Raisins decocted in Almond milke, or Goates milke. To haue his meate drest with Sugar and honie is very good, Vineger or Veriuice tempered with any kind of Spice, as Saffron, Ginger, Nutmegs, Cloues, Cinamome, or Cardamome. In stead of Sallad oile is fresh Butter, Barrows grease, and Goosegrease good for him. Further all that be grieued in the breast, shall occupie much these hearbs in their drinks and otherwise, as Venus haire, Hyssope, Horehound, Elecampane, and Saffron. For his drinke, Wine is not vtterly forbidden, but he may drinke some small draughts, and that the oftener, Swéet and pleasant Wine is most wholesome for him, tempered in the Som∣mer with Well water, and in Winter with decocted water, notwithstanding that good swéete red Wine were as good. But if the patient will not gladly drinke Wine, then is this meade following to be prepared for him: Take three quarts of the water of Cinamome and Saffron, of each one dragme and a halfe, Hyssope one dragme, seeth it so long vntill the fourth part be sodden away; then put thereto twelue ounces of honie, and seeth it againe till the third part be sodden away: skumme it, and then let it runne through a cloth. Of all wines the Renish wine is most commended, brued a little with water, for it fumeth not into the head, but hasteneth towards the bladder, and caryeth the matter with it. Sweet Limons, Pomegranates and Quince peares, being well sugred, are also permitted for the appetite: but Marmalade streng∣theneth much the breast and lights. This is then the order to be obserued in this sicknesse, chiefly when as it proceedeth of flegme, and not for any short time, but the same is stil to be continued: for as we haue alreadie shewed, this sicknesse is of long continuance, and perillous, so that if one do his very best therein, yet it is in young persons very hard, and in old folkes almost vnpossible to be cured. And although there be many sicknesses of the breasts (like as is alreadie rehearsed, and shall be yet againe spo∣ken of hereafter) yet is there no euidenter meanes for to know whether the Lights be infected or fraighted, then through the Cough, and by that which is cast vp in coughing. It is also to be noted, whether the breathing be vneasie, slow and wheasing, &c. For the troublesomnesse of the paine, and of the fetching vp of the flegme, do bewray the matter which causeth the disease and vlceration of the Lights, therefore must all Phisitions looke diligently vnto it: for when the matter is knowne, then is it easily to be discerned, whereof this griefe in the breast is caused. This may suffice for this present. Of the breast oppressed with Phlegme. §. 11. WHen any such sicknesses do light vpon men, then must they be knowne and dis∣cerned (as is alreadie recited) therefore we will write first of Phlegma, as of the most common infection of the breast. In this sicknesse is first the Basilica to be opened in the right arme, letting out foure or fiue ounces of bloud, and after∣wards this drinke following to be vsed. Take tenne or twelue Figs, Dates, Smallage seedes, Fennell seedes, Venus haire, Hyssope and Horehound, of each fiue dragmes, seeth them together vnto about the half, take about three ounces thereof, and temper therewith this Confection following, and take such once in euery three dayes, or once in euery foure, fiue or sixe dayes, for it exceedingly ex∣pelleth the superfluous matter from the breast.
Take the iuice of Licorice, Hyssope, and Venus haire, of each tenne dragmes, Pepper, bitter Almonds, Aristologie, Cresses séedes, and Nettle séede, of each three dragms, Hony as much as is needefull for to make a confection; the Hony must be boyled and clarified. But aboue all it is to be aduised, that after letting bloud he take one dragme, or foure scruples of Pillulae de Agarico, which are much commended for this sicknesse. Or vse these pils following: Pillulae de Hiera com∣positae, Aurearum, of each two scruples, make therof seuen or nine pils with sirupe of Roses, and take therof twaine early in the morning: and fiue houres after that take a draught of leane Hen broth; and then one houre afterwards breake your fast. The next day, take in the morning this preparatiue Syrup. de Bizantijs, de Calamintha, de Glicyrrhiza, of each halfe an ounce, water of Cicorie, of Violets and Balme, of each one ounce, temper them all together, and drink there∣of eight daies long fasting. When this is done, then take this purgation following: Take Ele∣ctuarij Indi, two dragmes, De Psyllio half an ounce, temper them all together in a little warme wine, and drinke it in the morning early. Some do counsell also, that after purging héede be taken that one vomite with beaten Mustard séede and Honie: for that doth vehemently expell the matter off the stomacke. And if that you perceiue the matter be to be cast vp, then take the water of blew Flower de luce, Hyssope and Marioram, of each one ounce, water of Folefoote two ounces, Sugar halfe an ounce; temper and vse them euery morning for the space of one whole wéeke: afterwards take thrée ounces of new Cassie, and water of Folefoote wherein two scruples of Rhapontica, and Spica halfe a scruple were stéeped, drinke it warme, and fast sixe houres after it. This vnguent following may also be vsed euery day, annointing the belly warme therwith couering it with a peece of warme fur: Take oyle of Saffron, oyle of Cammomill, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Ducks, and Badgers grease, of each one quarter of an ounce, Saffron half a scrup. white Pepper, Ireos, and Rue, of each one quarter of an ounce, white Waxe as much as is néedfull, thereof to make an vnguent or salue. Here is also to be noted, that all sowre and egar things, and all that is drest therewith, as sowre Pomegranates, Orenges, Limons, and such like, are very hurtfull: In like maner is al∣so grosse sowre wine and Sallad oyle very hurtfull. These pils following are to be prepared: Take good pot Aloe thrée dragmes, Agaricus and the roote of Polypodie, of each one quarter of an ounce, Coloquint one drag. Spica, Ginger, and Indie salt, of each halfe a scruple; beate them all together, and steepe them in the iuice of Roses and of Endiue, of each two ounces, keep it in a warme place, stirre it about till it waxe drie, then afterwards powre thereon againe two ounces of the iuice of Marioram gentle, and let it drie also. Thirdly, temper therewith two oun∣ces of the iuice of small Endiue, and halfe a scruple of Saffron: when it is drie, then take the waight of a drag. thereof, make pils of it; of which take alwaies one euery fift day before supper, and one more two houres after. This may euery such patient vse all his life long in all coun∣tries. The like also when he vseth the preparatiue Potions, if he be bound in his body, he may freely take one of them in the euening before meate. These pils haue great force to preserue health; for they cleanse the breast, the stomacke, and the liuer. He must eate euery weeke a peece of greene Ginger, and fast at least foure houres af∣ter it. In winter time must he strew vpon his head twice a weeke, this powder following: Take Lignum Aloes one dragme, Mace one quarter of an ounce, Stechas, Marioram gentle, and grosse Marioram, of each one scruple, Roses, Iuorie, and Sandaraca, of each one drag. and a half, beate all small and temper them together. For a confection: take Spec. Aromatici Rosati, Trociscos de Rosis & de Spica, of each halfe a drag. sixe ounces of white Sugar, make thereof Tabulates, and eate thereof after meate. If you vse not greene Ginger, then is also good for you, the Tabulats of Diaireos Salomonis, and moe confections that serue for this end, euen as it is described in the discouerie of Asthma. There is a fume also to be made for this patient, with Myrrhe, Costus rootes, Saffron, Cassia wood, Aristologie, or Galbanum, which liketh him best, each alone, or mixt together. Also he is euery euening to wash his feete, euen to beneath the knees in warme fresh water, wherein Roses and Violets, of each two handfuls, Mints, Marioram and Stechas, of each one handfull, haue bene sodden.
Of the right pursiuenesse with a sore old Cough through tough Phlegma in the Breast, which is called with one word Asthma. §. 12. BY this name Asthma some later Phisitions comprehend the thrée foresayd spe∣cies of pursiuenesse, to wit Dispnaea, Asthma, and Orthopnaea, for that the breath in these thrée sortes is hardly drawne, which is peraduenture because all the diseases of the breast and the Lights haue a naturall participation togither, that they are very hardly to be discerned, euen as may be well obserued out of these desciptions following, where the lights and breast commonly are com∣prehended togither: neuerthelesse they haue partly their difference, whereof we (as farre as is possible) shall giue good instructions. It hapneth also oftentimes, that these plegmaticke humours do fall out of the head into the lights and breast, that they fill them full, and if then that nature be not so strong that she can auoyd or consume the tough slime, then wil it corrupt there, and conuert into that, wherof then (if it be not looked to) the Hectica or Phthisis, which is the consumption, is wont to follow, as hereafter shall appeare. Therfore is this Asthma to be alwayes preuented: for when it begin∣neth to be confirmed, then is there no more helpe to be done, nor cure to be wrought. As much as then concerneth the order of liuing in this sicknesse, he must (as much as is pos∣sible) rule himself according to these foresayd ordinances; for which, all they that are vexed with Asthma, are to haue twice a wéek cups fastned on their buttockes without picking: what is fur∣ther fit, as to open the breast, and to bring vp phlegme, you haue good remedies in the second Chapter of the Cough, and yet moe not long before in the 8. §. that may stand also in some stead for this purpose. Now follow diuers confections and other medicines that are good for Asthma, Take Sage, Ʋenus haire, Folefoote leaues, Lungwort, Violet leaues, and Hyssop, of each a handfull, Penni∣royall and Thime, of each halfe a handfull, floures of Buglosse, Violets, Burrage, and Cicorie, of each halfe so much, Annis séede, and Fennell séede, and séedes of Mallowes, of each halfe an ounce, Elecampane and Licorice, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Parsly and Polypody rootes, of each halfe an ounce, ten or twelue Figs, Currans foure ounces, prepared Agaricke thrée dragmes, Spica, Squinant, Galingall, and Cinnamom, of each halfe a dragme, Ginger and graines: séeth this altogither with a mild fire in sufficient water, vntill there do remaine about a pinte, wring and straine it well out, then put as much Sugar vnto it as you thinke good, and let it seeth to the thicknesse of Hony, vse this Lambatiue, and lick thereof as much and as often you please. Confection of Currans.The Confection of Currans, which are vsed of all Apothecaries, is thus prepared: Take Piony rootes halfe an ounce, dried Hyssope, Baulme, and Harts tong, of each halfe a handfull, Licorice cut small halfe an ounce: séeth these al togither in sufficient rayne water, wring it hard out, and straine it through a cloth: Put into this decoction washt Currans that be well pow∣ned: séeth it once againe with the decoction, and straine it through a cloth or a hairne scarce, put thereto a pound of Sugar, and let it seeth into a confection: it is speciall good to open the breast, to swage the Cough, and to maturate the phlegme. Another. Take washt Currans, or Raisins fiue ounces, seeth them softly vntill that they swell, powre them into a sieue and presse them through, put thereto twelue ounces of Sugar, and then seeth them togither into a confection. This Confection following is good for the common people, take Colewort leaues with the red stalks, cut the stalks & ribs, stamp them in a wodden mortar, an straine out the iuice: let it séeth, and take as much Hony as there is iuice; seeth it all togither vnto the thicknesse of Hony, stirring it alway about. If you wil haue it stronger, than temper some Saffron amongst it. A∣nother. Take Hollyhock roots one ounce, Elecampane half an ounce, let them seeth togither in water of Violets, stamp them to pap, temper therewith one dragme of Cheruill seed, and make therof a confection with sodden Sugar, let them seeth togither in water of Violets, stamp them to pap, temper then therewith one dragme of Cheruill seed, and make thereof a confection with sodden Sugar, let them seeth togither vntill they be thicke. Or take one dragme of Rubarb, oyle of fresh Almonds three ounces, and two ounces of the
creame of Milke, temper them togither boyled on warme ashes, & vse thereof often, for it is ve∣ry good. Some put thereto one dragme of Rubarb more, which is not to be discommended. Yong children may haue this kind of powder prepared: Take Masticke, Frankinsence, and Citron pils, of each a like much, beate it small togither, wherewith rub the child softly in the seame of his scull. Afterwards giue him hereof to licke; take fresh oyle of sweete Almonds, tem∣per therin white Sugar beaten; but if the obstruction of the breast be much, then tēper amongst it Trociscos de Agarico, or giue him the powder thereof to drinke; in like manner also Rubarb with Spica of Indie, with Cinnamom, or Squinant, according to the importance of the cause. Old folkes may vse this as well as yong children. How commodious the Cassia is for all sore Coughs, is sufficiently declared in our Introdu∣ction. But for this paine in the breast, it is néedefull that it be tempered with Agarick, or some other thing, according to the qualitie of the sicknesse. But for this is especiall heede to be taken for women with child, that it be not giuen them without great cause, bicause it maketh paine or ache in the belly. Item, take Sulphur vise two graines, temper it with a little Hony, and so take it in, for it is maruellous good. There is also to be had ready at some Apothecaries a costly compound Trociscos de Sulphure,Trocisci de sul∣phure Adul∣phi. or called Adulphi, and is thus prepared: take losinges of Cole, Dragagant, & Sugar pennets, of each halfe an ounce, Ginger two scruples, Licorice thrée dragmes, Ireos one scruple, Hyssop, Nettle seede, Rosemary floures, Saffron and Sulphur vife, of each seuen graines, mixe it with Looch sanum, and forme trocisces thereof, take a little of it, letting it melt alone in the mouth, and vse it often. They make also a Confection of Brimstone: take Sulphur vife one scruple, mixe it with fresh Butter, and Muscilage of Linseede, or Elecampane one ounce, take thereof often, and a little at once. The Confection of Foxe lights, that is, Looch de pulmone Ʋulpis, is aboue all other remedies,Looh de pul∣mone Vulpis. for the Asthma (which is a shortnes of breath) very much commended; for it is not only good for a sore Cough and short breath, but it healeth and cleanseth all vlcers of the breast and Lights. And for the consumption it excelleth all other remedies, & is made thus: Take prepared Foxe lights, the iuice of Licorice, Annis séede, Fennell seede, and Venus haire, of each halfe an ounce, clarified Sugar seuen ounces and a halfe; beate these togither, and decocted with Sugar in the water of Folefoote leaues, temper it into a confection. Hereafter follow some good Potions for this shortnesse of breath. Take Sebestes, Figs and Dates, of each fower, Venus haire, Violets, Currans and Licorice, of each one quarter of an ounce, white Poppy seede one ounce, Cinnamom one quarter of an ounce, Annis seed, Fennell, Agrimonie, Hyssope, of each one ounce, 20. Iuiubes, Sugar or Hony fiue ounces, thrée or foure pintes of water: let this séeth togither vntill the third part be sodden away, straine the liquor through a cloth, and put the Sugar thereto or hony, and let it seeth againe vntill it be cleare. Itē take 3. quarters of an ounce of Figs, Dates, Horehound, Smallage seed, Fennel, Roses, Venus haire, Hyssope and Licorice, of each fiue dragmes; seeth them as before, or to the halfe. The common people may seeth water with hony and Hyssope: & as the shortnesse of breath beginneth to lessen, he must lay one dragme of Agaricus in the water of Betonie and Hyssope to steepe, and temper amongst it some hony of Roses, and so drinke it togither. Also the common Meade, and Sugar water, is good to drinke. Another Potion. Take a pinte and halfe of white wine, steepe therein one handfull of Hore∣hound; let it seeth togither vntill the third part, straine it and put thereto sixe ounces of clarified Hony; let it seeth a little togither, and scum it diligently, whereof the patient is to drinke euery day two or three ounces. Some do take three ounces of Hony, and do melt therin half an ounce of Turpentine washt, or as much Oxymel: Both are good and sure. A maruellous good medicine which is highly esteemed in Turky. Take the liuer of a Wolfe, the Milt, Lights and braines: salt well the braines, and take of these fower of each a like much, let them be dried well that they may be powned: Giue the patient thereof one quarter of an ounce with a little fresh broth three daies one after another in the morning fasting, and let him fast afterwards fiue or sixe houres. The sicke partie must take his drinke through the Wolfes throate; & when this is so done, they report that they (which vse the same) be from thenceforth
fréed of it all the yeare following: but if it returne not within one twelue moneth, that then it will neuer come againe. And if he had this sicknesse any more afterwards, they aduise that one should make a lace of the Wolfes maw, and weare the same all his life time on his naked bodie; for thereby should he be certainely fréed of this sicknesse. But to trie these things is the best way. Water distilled of Elecampane, or broth wherein it is decocted is very good, and chiefly if it be mingled therewith. Hereafter are some things described, which the diseased may hold vnder his tongue without chewing as big as a beane, and swallow it downe by little and little. Take Looch de Pino one ounce and a halfe, Sugar pennets halfe an ounce, powne them toge∣ther. Item, take Looch de Farfaria (called ad Asthma) as much as you thinke méete, and as much powned Hollihock rootes, make a hard confection thereof with prepared honie or sugar. And if any do resist these weake things, then shall he in the stead thereof vse Diapenidion described in this Chapter and 6. §. And if it happen (as it woonteth often) that the sicke person by reason of this cough cannot sléepe, then is he once or twice a wéeke to take this potion when he goeth to bed. Take placents of Ireos one dragme, the confection of Philonium Romanum halfe a scruple, temper it with one ounce and a half of Hyssop water, and at the same time strew on the top of the patients head this powder following: Take Sandaraca one quarter of an ounce, Cloues one drag. Mace two scruples, Roses, water Lillies, Violets, and Poppie heads, of each half a drag. Lignum Aloes one scruple, stampe each a part and temper them together. Plaisters or Vnguents for this Asthma. TAke fat Dates and Figges, of each one ounce, Mallowes, Hollihocke leaues, of each three handfuls, rootes of Mallowes and of Hollihockes, of each halfe an ounce, cut them to péeces, and boile them together into a pappe, mixe Pigeon dung amongst it, Turpen∣tine, and Rosin, of each one ounce, the muscilage of Linséede, and of Fenegréeke as much as is needfull for to make a mild plaister, lay it warme vpon the breast; the same doth also the fatte shéepes wooll. Item, take Comfrey rootes, broad and narrow Plantaine, Purslaine, and Henbane, choppe them small and séeth them together in the waters of Plantaine and Purslaine vntill it be thick, beaten well and mixt with Pomegranate pils, Acorne cups, Galles, and Myrtle séede (which haue bene stéeped eight howers in warme water:) then strained out hard and powred to the rest and boiled vnto a little; afterwards mingle it with fine Bolus, the meale of Lupines, and Barly meale, of each halfe an ounce, Gummi Helenij one quarter of an ounce, Waxe and Tur∣pentine as much as is néedfull for to make a meetely thicke plaister, then spread it on a leather and lay it vpon the breast. The vnguent Althea is very good to annoint the breast withall, as the same is often here before commaunded to be vsed. Item, annoint the breasts with the oile of Wall flowers, of Bayes and Dill tempered toge∣ther or each a part. Or take oile of Violets and of swéet Almonds, of each one ounce, Duckes grease and butter, of each foure ounces, Saffron two scruples, white Waxe as much as needeth for to make a soft Vnguent. Certaine excellent things in generall. §. 13. THese things following are much commended for all diseases of the breast, and for all coughes in generall. First, the gum Ammoniacum dissolued in Barley water and honie, and taken: Aristologie, bitter Almonds, & oile of swéet Almonds drest with all meates, Boiled Sothernwood, Balsam wood, & the fruits of the same: prepared Coloquint is wonderful good for this, being vsed in pils: Cypers decocted in wine, confected Elecampane roots, Galbanū, the rootes of blew Flower de luce, Myrrhe put into pils of Agaricus, Coriander and Spikenard séede, rere egs supt vp, or Cawdles made thereof, Léekes with Barly water and honie, Nettles and their séede with Barley water and Hony, Woodbind, Sandaraca, gréene Rue boyled in Vineger, Squils are speciall good, rosted, or howsoeuer you will vse them; for that they be com∣mended
and estéemed aboue all other medicines. Saffron tempered in the broth of a Cock, wild Saffron seed, the gum Sagapenum giuen in with Rue water, Sesely seeds, Foxe longs prepared one dragme onely, Hyssope and all that is prepared with this herbe, is good for the lights and the whole brest, confected rootes of the Star thistle Eryngton, conserue of Rosemary, and all that is made of Rosemarie, Betony, Gilloflowers, and all that is made thereof: Nutmegs that are confected, do consume all superfluous humors, not only of the Lights, but also of all the inward parts, albeit that some suppose, that they are hurtfull for ye Lights: Walnuts that are confected in Sugar or Hony, do warme the Lights and all inward parts, for which this thing following is very good. Take a sweete Pomegranate, cut it in fower parts, Strew the péeces with Sugar candy, and bind them togither againe, binding or wrapping them in a moist cloth, and let them rost leisurably, then take out the coare, and eate it for a medicine. Conserues of Eyebright ope∣neth al inward members, and all obstructions of the Lights, like as doth also the wine which is described in the first Part against the diminishing of the sight. Calmus which is confected, hath a speciall power for the opilation of the Lights, and to open all inward obstructions. Comin doth also the same, Caraway and Fennell confected, or eaten raw: likewise Fen∣nell is good for all Coughes, roughnesse of the throate, and hoarsenesse. Treacle and Mithridate are also very good for this. Al Losinges of Diapenidion, of Dragagant, iuice and sirup of Licorice, and all kindes of Oxymel (as is already sayd) are altogether maruellous good for this disease. Siliquae rosted in ashes are also good against all shortnesse of breath, and all kinds of Coughs: M. Tristams water: In like manner both the sirups of Vineger, Simplex & Compositus are also spe∣cial good for this purpose. Also all the forementioned Potions for the Cough and the brest, euen as they are set downe in the second Chapter §. 2. In like manner also a costly stomachicall pow∣der, which is described in the first Part, the 12. Chapter §. 1. that may be also vsed for Asthma. Of shortnesse of breath through Cholera. §. 14. IN the beginning of the description of this shortnesse of breath we haue shewed, that the same is caused very seldome of Cholera; and if the same should be caused thereby, then is the same yet to be cured through the same meanes, as in all places are expres∣sed hereafter and before. Therfore is here no speciall matter to treate of, but onely the signes that are of this sicknesse through Cholera, and afterwards to see wherewith to delay the heate. As concerning the signes thereof, it commeth with great drought, heate, and gnawing about the breast, and the same rather in the right than in the left side, with a yellow colour al ouer the brest, wherwith commeth also a roughnes of the tongue and of the throte, and especially about the time when the Cholera accustometh to moue and stirre, which is from thrée a clocke vntill nine in the day time, whereby the patient will also cast vp small store of flegme, and that is yellowish: In his sleep appeareth yellow things, and fiery fantasies, as lightning, and such like. The pulse is hard, quicke, and continuall, except the patient had lost most part of his naturall strength: the Vrine is thicke, yellow, and ruddie, but in the bottome cleare and subtile: yet do these signes alter with euery mutation of an accident, according to the which euery expert per∣son may know to direct himselfe. These things following do coole the heate of the breast in ge∣neral, and the inflammation of ye Lights, as Cassia, new Conserues of Roses, Iulep of Roses, sirupe of Roses, and such like; conserues of Burrage, Buglosse, and their wine, if they be not ex∣presly forbidden for some reason. In like manner the Cherry wine, which is of a temperate nature. Item, Conserue of Violets & Iulep, Conserues of Cicorie do cleanse all inward members of Cholera, driueth it out through the stoole, and doth withstand all Agues of Cholera. Peaches confected in Sugar are also a spe∣ciall comfortatiue for all hot diseases, for that they coole all inward members, like as doth also the Conserues of water Lillies. Take the iuice of Chickwéede, and Verueine, or the water wherein they are decocted (if you please) it is very good for al Coughes. Sirup of the right Endiue is speciall good for hot Lights, and for all inward hot parts. Likewise also Manna of himselfe and his confection, Electuarium de Manna, which is ready to be had at all Apothecaries.
Of the shortnes of breath through Melancholia. §. 15. EVen so it is also with Asthma through Melancholia, which is through the heauie bloud, that happeneth very seldome, whereof these are the signes: a right leaden co∣lour of the face and the brest, running eyes, with great heauines of the spirits, wher∣with is also a fearefulnesse, faintnes of hart, desire to be solitarie, especially from nine of the clocke in the day time, vntill two or thrée in the night: he complaineth also of more abate∣ment or lacke of breath in the left than in the right side, and of little sleepe: he is also vexed with many heauie fantasies, he cougheth vp much thin spettle, and that with much ado: his water is thin, white and cleare, his going to stoole is lead colored and hard. There is heard much rum∣bling and wind in his breast and in all the bodie. Yet do these signes alter through diuers occa∣sions, so that you must note the meate and drinke that the patient hath accustomed himselfe to vse before time. How this disease is to be remedied and cured, you shall find in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, §. 8. of Madnes, of Melancholia, and all that is said in the third part of the foule me∣lancholicke bloud. Of the shortnesse of breathing or Pursiuenesse through wind. §. 16. WHereas there is any short breath, or heauinesse in the breast through wind, the same will be alwaies augmented through meates and medicines that ingender wind, as may well be noted through the rumbling and course of the wind in the breast and o∣ther places more. For this must be vsed, Rue, and Penniroyall, of each one ounce and a halfe, Serapinum, Opo∣panacum of each one dragme, Comin one ounce and a half: all this being beaten together, make therof a salue with molten Waxe, and annoint the breast therwith very warme. This salue is also very good for all heauie breathing that proceedeth of grosse tough matter, and that is impa∣cted into the Lights: for it separateth and consumeth the same. What further might be done for this, that may you sufficiently perceiue by all the forementioned Treatise, wherein hath bene spoken of this sicknes. For this short and sore breath through wind cannot be alone by it selfe: but there must be with it either Cholera, or Phlegma, or Melancholia, or bloud: of all which there is sufficiently written. Of the spetting bloud through some disease of the Lights. §. 17. THe spetting of bloud may come of many occasions of the braines, which are woont to be eased through bléeding at the nose, whereof is written in the first part the eight Chapter, and 7. §. Secondly, through any hurting or brusing of the throte or the mouth, for which you are to looke in the first part the 13. Chapter. Thirdly, through hurting of the gums, whereof we haue sufficiently mentioned in the first part: also the sae is sometimes caused of the Lights, brest and stomacke, also of the Liuer and of the mother, &c. This spetting of bloud do the Greeks call Hemoptoin, whereof we will write at this present. The cause of this bléeding may happen through falling, thrusting, and such like outward occasions of the breast, or of any horsleach drunken, through great heate, or great cold, strong coughs, to crie loud, to vomit much and vehemently, through long vse of hote peppered meats, or through vse of onions and garlicke, through much subtil bloud, through neglect of accusto∣med letting bloud, and through some disease of the lights: or when a veine chanceth to breake, whereof hereafter we shall discourse in particular. The signes of this spetting of bloud that commeth out of the breast, or out of the Lights are, that when the same procéedeth out of the breast, then will there be felt great paine in the same: and contrariwise, when it procéedeth out of the lungs, there will be felt very little paine, the
spetting bloud, out of the breast is not so perilous as that from the Lights. But when there is a veine broken opē, then runneth it most abundantly. If it be caused of any other inconuenience, as of impostumations, bruses, or hurts, then commeth vp but little bloud, and that full of scum. When as then a sick man through haking without coughing fetcheth vp bloud, it commeth from some little veines about the throate, where you may easily come by it with any kinde of remedies: but the patient for this disease must forbeare to eate excessiue meate and drinke, by reason that thereby much bloud is engendred, whereby through the superabounding in the veines the throate openeth: but if he be prouoked to such bléeding through vomiting, then it is a signe that it commeth from the stomacke: the which is not much to be feared, for that the same is to be easily preuented through letting bloud, setting boxing cups, opening the mother veine, or opening their termes or flowers: in like sort by taking some astringent things, as the seedes of Sumach, sower grapes, and such like. Item, through this potion following: Take fine Bo∣lus, Gum, Dragon bloud, Pomegranate blossoms, & Frankinsence, of each a like much, powne them togither to powder, and take thereof thrée dragmes, and temper it with sodden iuice of Quince peares. For meate is very good, Starch, péeled Beanes, Lentils, Pease, vnleaue∣ned bread, Turtle doues, and common Pigeons. Of fruites, all that binde, as Medlars, Ser∣uices, Quince peares, Prunes, Peares, and such like. For drinke, milke wherein are quenched glowing pibble stones, steeled water, thicke red wine a little now and then, sirupe of Poppie heads tempered with water, wherein Quince kernels and Myrtle seedes are decocted. It hap∣neth oftentimes that such spetting of bloud commeth of it selfe, without any cause at all, wher∣by the patient is neither hindred nor harmed at all, and is to haue his course: but if the same do chaunce through coughing, which is a signe that the same ascendeth from the lights and the breast, then is it to be feared, that it will be Phthisis, that is, the cōsumption which then ensueth, bicause one cannot come to this place with necessarie remedies. Then for this sicknesse it is best to let bloud immediatly at the first, and that in the Liuer veine, whereby the bloud may be de∣riued from the Lights. Others do first of all open the Saphaea on the feete, that the bloud might be drawne downwards, and alwayes on the same side that it is adiudged the disease to be. The third sort counsell for this disease, to set boxing cups on their buttockes. This being all done, the patient is to be layd in a coole chamber, where he may be as quiet as may be, without much stirring of himselfe, and must keepe from him all that might inflame his bloud, as anger, crying, copulation, laughing, hot couerings, hot and salt meates and drinke, bathing and such like. There are also no red colours to be brought in his sight. Aboue all this, binding is one of the principallest remedies against abundant bléeding, therefore is that also here to be vsed, as in o∣ther places is sufficiently taught. There are ordained many mo remedies against this spetting of bloud, euen as hereafter fol∣loweth, whereof you may choose that which liketh you best. Take Frankinsence and Dragon bloud, of each thrée dragmes and one scruple, of yellow Amber one dragme, prepared Bloudstone and sealed earth, of each ten dragmes, Allume two dragmes and a half, flowers of Pomegranats thrée dragmes, Opium two dragmes, Rubarb one quarter of an ounce, make thereof 18. trocisces with sirupe of Poppie heads, then temper euery day one in Purslaine water, and so drinke it. And if this spetting of bloud be too violent, then may the patient take one more at night. These things following are more certaine, because of the Opium: Take Mumia, Mastick, fine Bolus, and Dragon bloud, of each alike much, being all beaten small togither, make trocisces thereof with Purslaine water: for this is also good Trocisci de Carabe, and of Terra Sigillata. Now follow certaine confections and such like, wherewith the cause of this spetting of bloud will be taken away, for the which this following is a certaine remedie. Take a dragme of Egshels beaten small, and temper it with halfe an ounce of the sirupe of Poppie heads, or sirupe of Iuiubes: temper also with it the confection of Philonium Romanum, halfe a scruple, and so take it: if you had rather drinke it, then mixe it with some Purslaine water. Item, take con∣serues of Roses and Violets of each one ounce, the cōfection of Triasandalon thrée ounces, prepa∣red red Corall, Purslaine séede, & broad Plantaine seed, of each one quarter of an ounce, temper them togither with Rose water. Or take the spices of cold Dragagant cakes halfe an ounce, yellow Amber, prepared red Corall, Bloudstone, fine Bolus, Plantaine seedes, and Housleeke, of each one dragme & a halfe, Gumme, broad Plantaine séede, of each halfe a dragme, Mastick,
Frankinsence, of each thrée graines, Raisins one ounce, white Sugar as much as is néedefull, Purslaine water and Rose water, of each two ounces; séeth therewith the Sugar, vntill it be as thicke as Hony, and temper the rest being beaten small amongst it. Item, take Pingles one ounce, Currans one ounce and a halfe, beaten Licorice halfe an ounce, Ginger one drag. Cin∣namome two drag. as much Sugar as the rest: seeth them with the water of Plantaine, and temper the rest, being chopt and beaten amongst it. Take Henbane seedes tenne graines, prepared Corall one scruple, two or thrée ounces of Plantaine water, temper them together, & giue it him to drinke: put also therto the tabulats of Diatragacanthum, the confection of Diacodion, Looch de Portulaca, each alone, or tempered to a confection with the sirupe of Myrtles: the red losinges are also to be holden in the mouth that stand described with other. Treacle or Mithridate do maruellously withstand the spetting of bloud, if there be taken of them one dragme and a halfe, tempered with Vineger and Purslaine water. The confection of Foxe lights described here before in the 12. §. are also highly commen∣ded aboue all other remedies. Against all clodded bloud in the breast, be it of any wounds or otherwise, you are to drinke this: take field Cypers, stampe it small, and lay it 24. hours to stéep in Scabious water, wring it well out, and drinke oftentimes thereof warme. Item, take the herbe Horsetaile, beate it to powder, and drinke thereof euery time one drag. with Plantaine water twice a day. This powder may you also cast vpon the meat, and a little Bloudstone mixed amongst it. Item, take prepared Bloudstone, mixe it with water or iuice of Purslaine, and swallow it downe; for this stone hath a special force to stanch bloud, like as ex∣perience bringeth with it. Or take two scruples of prepared Bloudstones, and temper it with the renning of a young Déere, and make pils thereof, and hold them awhile in your mouth. Item, take Iuiubes, Sebestes, Dragagant, Gum, of each one quarter of an ounce, Annis séede, and seedes of Hollihockes, of each one drag. one quart of steeled water: séeth these together to the third part, whereof the patient is to drinke foure times a day. Item, take sirupe of Pop∣pie séedes, of Iuiubes and Myrtle séede, temper them together, or take each alone; make a drinke thereof with water wherein Quince or Myrtle séede is boyled. Another. Take Myrtle séede, broad Plantaine seede, both beaten small, of each one dragme, temper them with Purslaine water, and drinke it treatably. Or vse this following in this man∣ner also, take beaten Lupins one quarter of an ounce, prepared Bloudstone one dragm, tempe∣red with Purslaine water, and drinke it as is said. Betonie laid in Wine is also many times ap∣proued in the spetting of bloud. There may also salues be vsed outwardly vpon the breast; yet here is to be noted, that it is very commodious for the spetting of bloud, but for the cough very hurtfull, therfore this follo∣wing is rather to be vsed: take oile of Roses, or Myrtles, of swéet Almonds, & iuice of Prunes, of each a like much, and make thereof a salue with molten waxe. Item, take beaten Frankin∣sence, temper it with the white of an Egge, and lay it on the breast. Or take the iuice of Sloes Hyppocystis Dragon bloud, blossomes of Pomegranats, Gals, Mastick, and Roses, of each foure scruples, Turbith, fine Bolus, of each one dragm, oile of Roses, of Myrtles, of Masticke, of each halfe an ounce, the white of an Egge well beaten, and Waxe as much as is néedfull for a salue. The black Tabulates described in the second part, the second Chapter, and 2. §. shal the patient hold vnder his tongue. And if this be desired to be more forcible, then is it to be prepared as her∣after followeth: take Dragagant, Plantaine séeds a little parched, and Gumme, of each half an ounce, Bloudstone, the yellow seedes of Roses, fine Bolus, sealed earth, Amber, and red Corall, of each one dragme, muscilage of Fleawoort seed tempered with Purslaine water, as much as is needfull for to forme therewith these trocisces, vse them as is said. It is also needfull that the body be purged. For which this sirupe following may be vse: Take Myrtle seede and the seede of Butchers broome, Roses, blossomes of Pomegranates, the yellow seedes of Roses, Acorne cups, Gals, iuice of Sloes, and Hippocistis, of each halfe an ounce, white Saunders, Quinces and burnt Iuorie, of each one quarter of an ounce, Dragagant, Gum, fine Bolus, and Dragons bloud, of each one drag. and a halfe, sealed earth and Masticke, of each three drag. Frankinsence, white Poppie seede, of each two drag and a halfe, prepared Bloudstone halfe a drag. the iuice of Plantaine, and iuice of Quinces, of each sixe ounces. You must straine and scum the iuice, then powre thereto as much raine water as will serue to seeth
it together, and make thereof a sirupe with Sugar, whereof giue one ounce and a halfe tempe∣red with thrée ounces of Purslaine water during certaine daies early in the morning. This sirupe doth not loose, but stoppeth much rather, and stancheth bloud. For the purging vse these pils, de Agarico two scrup. Cochiae one scrup. make thereof seuen pils. Or make the si∣rupe of Roses laxatiue with Rubarbe in an astringent decoction, and Purslaine water, wherein the shels of yellow Mirobalanes be decocted, and this is a soluble and good purgation, it clean∣seth well the bloud. But if the cough be with it, then against night giue him a pill of Cynoglosso, and let him hold one in his mouth by day. For a broken Veine in the Lights or breast. §. 18. THe signes of a broken Veine in the Lights are (as is alreadie said) if the bloud be suddenly spet out or powred out by heapes, and that cleare, cleane bloud, and not clodded, then is present remedie to be looked for before it turne to an impostume, or that the bloud be congealed and turned into matter. For if so be that there be neglect thereof, then is there danger of neuer more to be holpen. And if so be that such forcible bloud will not be stayed, then are you to open out of hand the Liuer veine in the arme of the same side, where you thinke that the veine of the Lights is broken, and then to let no more but two or three ounces of bloud. And if you perceiue that there is any Cholera run out with it, then is the bleeding of the nose not bad for the same. But if this wil not helpe, then is the head veine to be opened betweene the thombe and the first finger, and let out about two ounces of bloud. There is good for this to purge choler with Cassia, soure Dates, Manna, and such like. To draw the bloud downward, the patient is to be rubbed softly with warme clothes in the outward members, also to set great boxing cups vnpickt on the top of the buttocks: and if the piles could be made bleede, that will do it much good. Salues. TAke beaten Gals, Acornes, Butchers broome seedes, and the iuice of Sloes, of each halfe an ounce, Myrtle séede, séedes of Plantaine and of Purslaine, of each thrée drag. Draga∣gant, Gum, Isinglas, Glew, of each fiue dragmes, Barly meale one ounce and a halfe, Starch, Mill dust, of each one ounce, Saffron one drag. séeth it in red wine, which is somewhat mild, and make pappe thereof, and lay it vpon the breast, and renew it once euery foure and twenty houres. And in case that the pap cleaue hard on the breast, then must you lay a fresh thereon. Item, take Sorrell water, water of Balme, Cicorie and Rose water, of each sixe ounces, Trociscos de Spodio, de Rosis, of each two scrup. red and white Behen, Doronicum, Harts bones, and Pearles, of each one scrup. Malmsey halfe an ounce, temper it together and seeth it a little, then dip a foure square wollen cloth in it, and lay it lukewarme ouer the left breast: in like manner one more on the same side of the backe bone, and refresh it euery day once. For stanching of bloud there are many sundrie remedies described in the first part, the eight Chapter, in the 7. §. where we haue spoken of the bléeding of the nose, yet is there here camman∣ded to be vsed (if néede require) these things following. Take Henbane seede and white Poppie séedes, of each fiue drag. sealed earth and red Corall, of each two drag. and a halfe, prepared Bloudstone one drag. and conserue of Roses foure oun∣ces, temper them all together and make a confection thereof. Vse a little thereof, and that with great héed. For this also may be taken the oile of Rosin distilled with Ireos and prepared Sul∣phur two ounces, Ireos one drag. beate it together very small, and vse thereof euery day three or foure graines. Yet it is to be vnderstood, that this is not to be done, but after all the foresaid things, as letting of bloud, and such like. Afterwards it is very good once in eight daies to take one quarter of an ounce of Turpentine, with a little Ireos rowled with powder of Licorice. This following is to be laid vnder the tongue: Take cold Dragagant tabulats two ounces, prepared Bloudstone, Amber, Glew, red Corall, and Pearles of each one dragme, temper them
all together with Looch de Papauere, as much as all the rest, and hold at all times therof in the mouth the bignes of a Beane. Order for meate and drinke. IT is very néedfull in this disease to obserue a certaine order in eating and drin∣king: therefore he is to feed with that which cooleth measurably, which thickneth the matter, and draweth it together. From ye first day to the fourth, the sick bo∣dy is to be kept soberly: afterwards is his meat to be drest & sod with one of these things following, as Dragagant, Gum, or a little cleane Glew, or a pappe of Starch, of Mill dust, or at the leastwise other meate strewed therewith. Pap of Goats milke that is prepared with pibble stones or stéele is good for him. Sodden Calues féete or Lambes feete, Pullets broth, or Capon broth drest with Isinglas are very commodious for him. There may also sometimes a péece of a Tench or an Eele, with other intrailes of fish be sodden in other meates: for it is certaine that those things for this sicknesse are very commodi∣ous. In like manner are the Lentils sodden with Wheate, and drest for this sicknes very méet: for this is also fit Iuiubes, Dates, Barly, thick milke, fresh Cheese, all kind of flesh wherein is little bloud, as Wood Pigeons, turtle Doues, and Partridges prepared with binding things, as with Quinces, Barberies, Raspes, and such like. If this spetting of bloud be caused through heate, then dresse his meate most with Lettice, Purslaine, Gourds, Melons, Daisies, Shepheards purse, and such like. For his drinke this following is very good: Take twelue ounces of very good Hony, foure pints of water that is twice stéeled with steele, being well sodden together, temper amongst it Dragagant and Gum, of each one drag. and a halfe, Saffron one scrup. let it seeth againe vntil the third part be sodden away. But if one will not drinke thereof alone, then is good red wine to be tempred amongst it. But let him drink what he will, if Isinglas be sodden in all his drinks or the powder thereof be mingled amongst his drinke, it is the better. He may also otherwhiles take a draught of Rose water, or Purslaine water. Raine water is commended aboue all o∣ther sorts of drinks, if a veine be broken in the breast, and chiefly if there be a little fine Bolus or burnt Iuorie tempered amongst it. This following is praised for a precious and an approued powder: Take the seedes of Plan∣taine, Butchers broome seeds, and the iuice of Sloes, of each one drag. prepared Pearles, red Corall, Amber, Blondstone, and Dragon bloud, of each one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus three quarters of an ounce, Dragagant, Gum, and Frankinsence, of each three drag. temper and beate it together. You are to take one scruple of this powder with Purslaine water foure times a day, one houre before breakfast, one houre before supper, and likewise two houres after. For congealed bloud. §. 19. WHen it is thought that (after the veine is stopt in the brest) there is yet stil a lit∣tle clotted bloud behind, then are these things to be vsed thereto. For which is fine Treacle highly commended, if thereof be taken one dragme, or a dragme and a halfe, with three ounces of water, wherein Licorice and Venus haire haue bene sodden. Or take old Treacle one drag. one ounce of Vineger, two ounces of Rosewater, temper it together and giue it him. For this is also good the water of Larks spurs, billet coles one quarter of an ounce beaten smal, and giuen to drinke in Vineger, is a generall medicine for all clotted or brused bloud. So is likewise the renning of all young beasts especially good for all clotted or brused bloud. If then any body hath caught a great fal, or is hard strucken or thrust, and afraid of any clotted bloud, then giue him euery mor∣ning and euening (each time) two or three ounces of the iuice of Cheruill. Item, take Cheruill water and Louage water, of each one ounce and a halfe, or two ounces, & drink it at a draught. Or take of Rubarbe halfe an ounce, Lacca one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus, & sealed earth, of each one dragme, Rubarb halfe a dragme, if you put thereto some burnt Sponges, it wil be so much the better, make a powder therof, and vse it as is aforesaid. Another: Take fine Bolus
halfe an ounce, sealed earth one dragme, Dragon bloud and Spermaceti, of each half a dragme, make a powder thereof, and giue him a dragme of it with white wine. This plaister following may also be made: Take Goates milke & hony, let them be well warmed togither, then temper amongst it as much fine Bolus, vntill it be as thicke as a plaister, and so lay it vpon the breast: it wasteth the clotted bloud. If any be afrayd that through falling or thrusting he haue broken any thing in his body, or feare to haue any clotted bloud within him, then is he to drinke one dragme of this following with warme wine or beere. Take foure ounces of the roots of red Bluglosse, cut them in péeces, and let them séeth in a pot of red wine vntil they be soft, then take them out and beate it to pap, put thereto two ounces of Spermaceti, and one pound of fresh Butter, let them melt togither with a smal fire, and therewith annoint the place, where the paine is greatest, and chiefly about the breast. Lastly, in the middle of the spetting of bloud, take one ounce of the iuice of Plantaine, tēper therein two or three graines of Opium, and giue it to the patient. Or make these conserues fol∣lowing: Take white Pepper and Henbane séede, of each fiue dragmes, sealed earth and Opium, of each one quarter of an ounce, péeled Hempe séede and Saffron, of each foure scruples, Beuer∣cod, Spica, Euphorbium, Pieretrum, Pearles, Amber, Zeduary and Doronicum, of each one scruple, Campher sixe graines, sodden hony as much as is néedful, giue of this halfe or a whole dragme with one ounce and a halfe of Plantaine water, tempered with halfe an ounce of wine. Comfortable things in and after the spetting of bloud. §. 20. FOr to kéepe nature by her might and power, these confections following are to be vsed. Take the flesh of Capons that are sodden with Dragagant in stéeled water sixe ounces, white and red Corall, Dragagant, Gum (both a little tosted) of each one dragme and a halfe, fine Bolus, Amber, sealed earth, Mumia, and Bloudstone, of each one dragme, Purslaine séede and Plantaine seede, of each three dragmes, Almonds steeped in the iuice of Quinces, three dragmes, Iu∣iubes, Sebestes (so drest also) of each one ounce, Specierum Electuarij Regum, one quarter of an ounce, Species of the cold Dragagant Tabulats foure ounces, white Sugar and Sugar candy, of each one pound and a half, or so much as you please, seeth the Sugar with Pullet broth, and mixe all the rest amongst it, and make of them morsels. Another. TAke Species de Gemmis, which are set foorth in the description of the hart, one dragme, and giue it with sirupes of Apples, this strengtheneth the hart and the Lights, it is very good for those that after spetting much bloud, be so faint harted, that they seeme to haue no more pulse. For conclusion: for this spetting of bloud we will here present some particular things to be vsed for the same, where there is neither Phisition, nor Apothecary neare hand: bitter Almonds with Starch are passing good for this, and also for all cold coughes: Agaricus one quarter of an ounce, steeped in sixe ounces of Purslaine water, and wring it well out, and so in one day at two times taken. Flowers of Pomegranates, Hippocistis, and prepared Corall, of each one dragme, with the white of an egge and Gumme tempered togither to Trocisces, and so hol∣den vnder the tongue. The iuice of Quinces, Centorie, burnt and washed Harts horne, prepared Amber, Lycium, sealed earth, fine Bolus, Myrtle seede, Myrrhe, or a little of all of them, thrée or foure graines at one time taken with wine is passing good. Likewise the iuice of Mints, or of Purslaine is highly commended for this disease. For this is also good the white Henbane seede, but not a∣boue three graines at once to be taken. The yellow seede of Roses, white Brier, and many other things moe that are aboue rehearsed, amongst other compounds (which are to be vsed alone) are very good.
Of the infection of the Lights which is called Peripneumonia. §. 21. THis name is as much to say in Gréeke as Phlegma, which is phlegme, slime or corruption of the Lights, which matter infecteth the lights, maketh them swell, and bringeth an hote Ague with it. This is caused chiefly of Cholera, or of Phlegma, yt which falleth through the veines, or out of the head into the lights, and may be caused of the matter that prouoketh the Pleurisie, or Squinancie, and falleth into the lights. And although the Peripneumonia, as an impostume of the lights, hapneth to breake out, whereby the lights are wounded; yet is it notwithstanding therein seuered from the Phthisi, that this infection of the lights is rather placed betwéene the small skin which couereth the lights, than in the substance of them where it can procure an ex∣ulceration; where contrariwise the Phthisis which is the right consumption, harmeth, impostu∣meth, and rotteth the very substance of the lights. The signes of this Peripneumonia, or maladie of the lights are these, namely, a troublesome breath, as if one would choke, whereby the sicke body is compelled to lift vp himself, his breath is alwaies hote, so that he doth alwayes cal for cold ayre. This phlegme is somtimes somwhat browne, and otherwhiles pure red, and sometimes greene and blacke and scummy. They do feele a wringing and paine in the breast, that reacheth from the ribs to the backbone. There is also a strong Ague commonly therewith, the tongue is red, and will be in time slimy and black, so that when one toucheth it with the finger, it cleaueth thereto. They cannot lye neither on the backe nor side, but must sit alway vpright: the chéekes are alwayes so red, as if they were pain∣ted. If then these signes all or in part do appeare, then is it most certaine that there is an impo∣stume in the lights, the which otherwhiles causeth such a strangling, and Apnaea, that the pa∣tient can get no more breath, and that it cannot be thought otherwise, but that the patiēt must stifle, and all this without any great stitch or féeling of great heate, which neuerthelesse is very great ouer the whole body. The remedies for this sicknesse are, that the head veine be opened, and afterwards the meanes be vsed which here before in the fift Chapter in the 5. §. are prescribed. The remedies for this sicknesse are, that the head veine be opened, and afterwards the meanes be vsed, that here before in the 5. §. is ordained for the Pleurisie, be it of what cause soe∣uer that they procéede: but good héede must be taken, for that this impostume sticketh déepelier in the body than the Pleurisie: so that whatsoeuer one layeth outwardly vpon the body, must be stronger and alwayes tempered with such things, that may conuey the medicine to the lights, and make the phlegme to be loosed the sooner: that which is to be layd on the outside, must not be layd on the side, but aboue ouer the breast; and if that the patient be not let bloud, then is he to be let bloud in the liuer veine in the arme. Of the anguish of the Lights which is called Empyema. §. 22. THis disease of the lights is altogither like the foresayd Peripneumonia, and procéedeth commonly of these causes following, to wit, when one is thrust hard vpon the breast, or hath fallen, whereby afterwards there flow bad humours to it, that at length alter in∣to matter. Also, this sicknesse can be caused of a continuall vse of some certaine vaporish meates and drinkes, or through a Rheume that falleth out of the head vpon the lights, and cannot be coughed vp by any meanes, so that there it doth putrifie, and must needes turne to matter: Or that inwardly within the breast some impostume happen to breake, whereby the matter run∣neth into the hollownesse of the breast, like as of the Squinancie, of the Pleurisie, and Peripneu∣monia commonly chaunceth. In fine Empyoma, which is an anguish or impostume wherein much matter gathereth togi∣ther, the which is burthened with all the foresayd matter with it. When as then any such anguish commeth into the Lights, then is it very hard or vnpossible to be holpen, for that there be no other meanes for to cleanse the same thē through the Cough, the which still exulcerateth more, and consumeth the lights.
The signes of the impostume in the Lights, are oppression of the breast, a painefull breath, to cough vp corruption, with a dry and salt Cough, to speake snappishly, a disordred pulse, with a small Ague, which is rather perceiued by night than by day, whereby there is but little sleepe. And to know in what place of the Breast that this impostume is, these are therefore the signes, namely, if it be in the right side, and the patient do lye vpon the left side, then hath he much more paine and griefe. Item, make a cloth wet in water wherein fine Bolus is dissolued, bind the same round about the breast, and vpon the place; where the same cloth is first of all dry, there is the griefe: if it dry on both sides, then are both the sides therewith infected. This sicknesse, be it as perillous and incurable as it will, notwithstanding are there no other remedies to helpe it, than they that are ordained for the paine in the Breast, for the Pleurisie, and chiefly for the cough: So that there must be vsed for the same now and then sirupes, and o∣therwhiles Plaisters, Confections, Pils, Tabulats, Gargarismes, and such like, now one, and then another. For asmuch then as we haue notified in all the foresayd places, and in the ensuing Phthisi or Consumption, many remedies, therefore it is needlesse to reckon them here againe, but onely to remember, if the amendement come slowly, that then it should not be discontinued and left off, for that this disease accustometh commonly to tarrie fortie dayes and longer: and if so be that the sicknesse be not cured in fortie dayes, then commeth thereof the consumption. And whereas it often happeneth, that neither inward nor outward remedies do helpe for this sicknesse, then doth the last refuge and necessitie constraine, that other remedies be sought for: to wit, that lastly the Brest must be opened, be it with a hot iron, corsie, or incision, that thereby the filth and matter be let run out, whereby the breast is to be cleansed, the patient cured, and old age atchie∣ued, therefore we will not pretermit to make knowen, what the auncient Phisitions haue taught thereof. First all such Plaisters are to be laid therein, that do discusse matter and maturate it: as these following: take Fenegréeke, and Linséede meale, of each thrée ounces, eight or ten fat Figs, sixe or seuen Dates, two ounces of Pease meale, Cammomill one ounce and a halfe, powne them all togither and séeth them in wine, and temper therewith two ounces of Turpentine, and Lin∣seede meale one ounce and a halfe, oyle of Cammomill one ounce, then make a plaister thereof, and lay it on the breast where the paine is. And if you suppose that this swelling procéede out of a cold cause, then put thereto two oun∣ces of Pigeon dung, Saltpeter one ounce, and oyle of Lillies as much as is needfull: Treacle or Mithridate (if there be no Ague) taken inwardly or layd thereon outwardly are very good. And that this impostume might the sooner breake out, the patient must prouoke himself as much as is possible, to lye on his side where it is, not to forbeare coughing, but to prouoke himself much rather to cough vp the same, as much as he can, thereby to breake the same the sooner. But if the anguish will not of it selfe incline to any breaking, then must the place where the same is, be opened on the outside, with an hot iron, Corsie or incision. When as the matter is all run out, and the impostume mundified, then it is like other impostumes to be cured. And if so be that through riddance of much filth, be it through coughing it vp, or any other issue, that nature doth begin to be weake, & requireth strengthening; then is the patient to be well prouided for, with good light bread, and sweete white wine, and broths of Hens, & vse all fowles that haunt the high countries. Goates milke is very good for him to vse: also rere egges, sodden Barley, Colewoorts broth, drest with Hyssope, Parsley, and with oyle of swéete Almonds. Lastly, all his meates are to be tempered with Hyslope and Saffron, by reason that they haue both a speciall congruitie or affinitie with the Lights and the Breast. Also there may be vsed a confection of the flesh of Capons, described of late in the 19. §. for a strengthening. With these foresaid things we will ad some other things, that are not onely commodious for the impostume of the Lights, but also for the Asthma, and all other diseases of the Lights: but chiefly some Potions, as wine of Marierom and Asarabacca, like as both of them in the end of this booke are described. Item, take Fenegréeke, Linséede, Hollyhock rootes, Mallowes, and wild Saffron, of each one handfull, dried Hyssope, and Venus haire, of each one handfull, eight or ten fat Figs, Currans two ounces, Sugar pennets, Licorice, of each one ounce, Fennell seede
one dragme, Turbith halfe an ounce, Ginger one scruple, Sal gemmae halfe a dragme; séeth all togither in three quartes of water, vnto two quartes, and euery day giue the patient there∣of sixe ounces. He may also vse this Cocke water following, the which is thus to be prepared: when as the greatest extremitie is past, and when the patient beginneth to recouer, then giue him a good Cruce ful of this broth following, for certaine dayes continually. Take a Cock of thrée or foure yeares old, course him so long vntill he lye still; afterwards kill him, and stuffe him with Cur∣rans, Figs, Licorice, wild Saffron, Venus haire, white Mints, Penniroyall, Fenegréeke; if you cannot get all of them, take the most part of them, of each a like much: let them séeth in a great kettle that you néede to powre no more water vpon it, drinke of this as is sayd. But the third day, take sixe ounces of this Potion, and séeth therein two cut Figs, vnto thrée ounces: then put thereto a dragme of Treacle or Mithridate, Philonium Romanum halfe a scruple, washt Turpentine one dragme and a halfe, and then take it all at one time. This order must he obserue certaine daies togither, albeit that it should last one whole yeare, which would be the better. Likewise there is good for this sicknesse, Turpentine taken with Hony, and prepared Foxe Lights, for it openeth the Breast, cleanseth the same, and healeth the Lights. Another Cocke water. Dresse the Cocke as he ought to be, and stuffe him with Hyssope, Lico∣rice, and Venus haire, of each halfe a handfull, Currans halfe an ounce: let them seeth well togi∣ther, and lastly put a dragme of Thymus vnto it, vse this broth, as is aforesaid. Item, melt a drop of Ammoniacum in a spoonefull of the water of life, and drinke it fasting. Of the consumption Phthisis, a disease of the Lights. §. 23. THis Phthisis, (the which by reason of her nature, is called the Consumption, and of the Latinists Tabes) is an vlcer of the Lights, of the Breast, of the throate, or of the mouth of the stomack, wherewith is alwayes a Cough or a small ague, wher∣by the whole body consumeth away, and waxeth impotent. Or Phthisis is an ex∣siccation and weakning of the body, whereby the whole body will be consumed, euen as the Gréeke name sheweth. Item, Phthisis is a sicknesse of the Lights, that dryeth away and consumeth the flesh, mar∣row, and all other powers of the body. In fine, Phthisis is all that harmeth the Lights, or de∣uoureth them. This disease is also of such nature and qualitie, that it seldome infecteth the ve∣ry young, the very old and aged persons, but most of all, as Hippocrates testifieth, those that are betwéene eightéene and 35. yeares of age: and this is the cause that the eager and sharpe mat∣ter in this age, be it through naturall or accidentall causes, doth as then raigne most of all in these kinde of bodies. First, this Consumption can procéede of many causes, as of a sore Cough, whereby any veine doth breake in the Lights, or of any eager brackish rheume that falleth vpon the Lights, and there through his eagernesse doth arrode some veine of the Lights, as a drop of water through continuall falling pierceth a hole into a hard stone. Secondly, this can also be caused through an impostume of the throate; the which breaking, falleth into the breast, and there annoyeth the same. Thirdly, of any impostume in the breast which after the Pleurisie, inflāmation of the Lights, or spetting of bloud, is not wel cleansed and taken away. Like as of Empyema (which is the infe∣ction of the Lights) hath bene sayd. Fourthly, such can also be caused through some obstruction of any accustomed course of wo∣mens Flowers, or course of the Hemorrhoides, which being closed vp, by their vapors do enda∣mage the Lights. Fiftly, it commeth through extreame outward heate, or cold raw windes, and especially in the falling of the leafe. Also straines, wounds, pestilent ayre, through long vse of many hote spices, Oinions, Garlicke, and other things moe, which do ingender much and subtill bloud, whereby a veine quickly commeth to breake, whereby afterwards the bloud putrifieth there, and turneth to an impostume.
These sicknesses can also be well prouoked through long conuersing in quicksiluer, the va∣por whereof harmeth and putrifieth the Lights. These also are the commonest signes of this sicknesse, to wit, when the sicke mans nose wax∣eth small and sharpe, when the temples of the head fall down, their arme pits do strecth out like wings, whereto commeth afterwards a small hot Ague, Cough after meate, oppression of the brest, grieuous breathing, matterie spettle, the which is alwayes a little died with bloud, which if it be cast ouer hot coales, yéeldeth a stench; or if one cast it in a kettle of water, doth sink to the bottome. The chéekes of the patient are alwayes ruddie, the nailes on the hands and feete will be crooked, he is sometimes hot, and otherwiles cold. In fine, they that are oppressed with this wretched sicknesse, are alwayes very raging and vnpatient, so that no body can do inough for them, &c. When as then besides all these signes, the bloud beginneth to consume, to dry a∣way, and the haire to fall off, then is he very far spent. Now for to come to the meanes whereby all such sicknesses are to be holpen, then is there first an old saying, that the old and ripe consumption is not to be cured: The cause is, that all such vlcers of the breast do corrode too deepe. Secondly, because the Lights must be in conti∣nuall motion, where notwithstanding all cures haue néede of quietnesse. Thirdly, through continuall motion doth race and eate in the déeper. Fourthly, for that the disease lyeth so deepe in the body, that Phisicke can hardly or slowly come to it. Fiftly, if hot remedies be to be vsed for it, then increaseth the Ague: if cold remedies, then haue they but small force to pierce to the place infected: Or if there be drying medicines vsed thereto, then do the same oppresse and putrifie there. These sicknesses may be setled a long time in children and old folkes, in corpulent and fat folkes, and specially in women: but if the sicknesse do draw to an end, & that besides all the sayd signes the stomacke faileth, and the laske approcheth with it, then is there small hope more at hand, notwithstanding, although this sicknesse (as it is sayd) is very dangerous, and long conti∣nuing, yet are the due remedies that serue for the same not to be despised nor abiected. And be∣fore al, as much as concerneth this disease, the eyes are to be fixed on seuen kind of things. First, to see that the Rheume be stayd, for the which you may here before finde diuers remedies in the Squinancie in the twelfth Chapter and 2. §. Also in the fifth Chapter 2. §. Secondly, heede must be taken to the vlceration of the lights, for which in this present description of the lights very many remedies are prescribed, moe shall be herafter specified. Thirdly, to driue away the Ague, and for that to this sicknesse many kinds of Agues are in∣cident, as may appeare in the sixt part of this booke. Fourthly, care must be takē to diminish this Cough, neuerthelesse to beware not to hinder altogither the coughing vp of the phlegme, for the which looke here before the 4. and 5. §. and also afterwards. Fiftly, the patient must obserue a good rule of liuing, whereof hereafter followeth a good instruction. Sixtly, meanes must be made to take away the spetting of bloud, whereof is at large dis∣coursed in the 17. §. Seuenthly and lastly, care is to be had to lengthen the sicke bodies short breath; for this, looke into the 12. §. of Asthma: what is further néedefull for this sicknesse shall follow hereafter. First there are here expressed foure principall things, as well fitting the patient for foode, as for remedie, to wit, Hony, conserue of Roses, Crabs that are taken in fresh waters, Figs, and certaine other fruits. As much as concerneth the Hony of Roses, it is alway more forcible than the common Ho∣ny, because that it expelleth phlegme and matter, pierceth and cleanseth, therefore is Hony ac∣compted a safeconductor of all other medicines which are commodious for this sicknesse. But if so be that there be with it a vehement heate, and putrifying Ague; then in the stead of the same Hony is Hony water to be vsed: for which cause some say that the Hony is not to be vsed in this sicknesse alone without scumming, for if the same be not scummed, and do not séeth, it is hurtfull, and causeth the Laske. The second is the conserue of Roses, through which onely some preserue themselues, and prolong their life: and if through vse of this the body chaunceth to be stopt, then is sirupe of Hyssope to be vsed, and if the same be too hote, then are Trociscos de Camphora and cold Tabulats of Dragagant to be vsed. Thirdly are the Crabs, which must thus be prepared: Take fresh water Creuets as many
as you will, séeth them so long in well water vntill they may be pluckt in péeces, then cut off the féete and skins, take off all the shels, and wash them well in Ley that is made of Vine-ashes, afterwards séeth them very mellow in Barley water: the patient must eate the Crabbes, and drinke the water. Fourthly, there are good for this disease in stead of Phisick, Raisins, Figs, Pingles, Pistacia, Currans, Sebestes, and Iuiubes. But for this we will discouer moe other remedies, amongst which is chiefly commended Asses milke, and if the same cannot be gotten, Goats milke is to be taken in the stead thereof: also bread sopped therein is to be eaten, and if that may be, he is to vse no other drinke sugred: but if that cannot be, then is he to vse therewith some sugred Béere, yet is it no counsell to vse the Milke, if therewith be any putred Ague. Here is also to be noted, that womans milke sur∣passeth all other milke: but be it what milke that it may be, yet must the same be drunken new milked, for all milke very quickly taketh an alteration and corruption. But if all manner of milke be lothsome to the partie, then prepare him this potion: Take Ireos one quarter of an ounce, of Hyssop and gréene Venus haire (if it may be gotten) of each one handful, péeled Barly thrée ounces, Melon seede, Cucumber séede, Gourd séede, Pompeon séede, séedes of Verbascum, Fenegréeke, Iuiubes, and Sebestes, of each halfe an ounce, Licorice and Raisins, of each one ounce, white Sugar nine ounces, Hony three ounces, seeth it all together except the Sugar and the Hony in a sufficient quantitie of raine water, according as you will haue it strong, let it seeth to the second part: when it is strained, then put the Sugar and Hony vnto it, let it séeth awhile and clarifie it. And if so be that after the vse of milke, there follow a small Ague, then shall he in stead of Milke, vse Barley water, or a thin Barly pap, for that clenseth the brest, and cooleth the same, and expelleth phlegme, but as soone as the Ague goeth away, then may you returne to the vse of the Milke. The rule of liuing. FIrst, they that haue the consumption are to chuse all such dwelling places, where it is al∣wayes cold & moyst, and chiefly where he is troubled with the Ague, situated to the North east and on the water. But if he cannot get the same, then must his chamber be often sprinkled with faire water; and if he be of ability, then is the chamber to be sprinkled in the place of common water, with stilled water of Violets, water Lillies, Cucumbers, Gourds, Pompions mingled; or each by themselues: or strew the chamber with Violet leaues, water Lillies, Vine leaues, and with other cold herbes. The chamber may also be fumed with these fu∣migations following, which are made of water Lilly flowers, Lettice seedes, and Purslaine seeds beaten together. He must not couer his head too warme. Secondly, almost all exercise and trauell is hurtfull, principally when as yet his head is full of humors; therefore shall he refraine all labour, and be still and take his rest. Thirdly, he must beware that he do not ouer eate himselfe, and it is more commodious to eate oftentimes, and a little at once, than for to eate once or twice a day very much: and so it is also with his drinke. He must also beware and refraine to eate with hunger, and that which he eateth must he chew very well, wheron many do thinke but little, that do either hate or smally estéeme their owne liues. In like sort must he eate to expell all the superfluitie of the stomacke or bowels. If there be any such thing in the stomacke, then must it be taken away by stooles, for vomiting is very hurtfull for this disease, but Manna or Cassia are to be vsed herein. But if the going to the stoole be hardened in the Bowels, then must this Clister be ministred: Take Mallowes, Béetes, Violet leaues, and small Woodbind, of each a handfull: séeth them together in sufficient water, take thereof twelue or sixtéene ounces, oyle of Violets, and of white Sesamum, of each one ounce and a halfe, fresh Butter three quarters of an ounce, Sal gem∣mae foure scruples▪ or one quarter of an ounce of common Salt, minister it only in the morning. Fourthly, his sléepe must be seuen or eight houres long, and not at all but at the least one houre after supper: he must shunne sléepe a day times, and is to sléepe halfe sitting, and not to lie vpon his backe nor on his face.
Fiftly, he must beware of anger, of calling aloud, and of all that will impact the phlegme in the breast, as of sorrow, feare, fright, and aboue all things of Venerie, for there is nothing that more abateth the nourishment of the body then the same, but he must by all meanes pos∣sible indeuour himselfe to be merry and of good cheare. As much as concerneth the sixt, to wit, meate and drinke, for that you haue this common rule, as, that his bread be of good white Wheate, and baked well, rising: also if the same be drest with the water of Folefoote, it were very commodious. Of fleshes are good for him, fat Pullets, Hens, Capons, and all field fowles, as Phesants, Partridges, &c. Also young Kids, Calues, Hares, rosted Pigs, Foxe lights, and the sewet of all these beasts. All water Fowles, wild Pi∣geons, and Géese are forbidden him. But this meate is specially commended, take Almond milke when he hath a strong Ague, and where there is no Ague take Goats milke, and seethe crums of white bread to a thin pap, and let him eate thereof, and such like pappes made with Wheate meale, Barly meale, or Millet meale, sweetened with Sugar or Sugar pennets: a∣mongst which one may temper some white Poppy seedes. All fish are permitted for this sicknesse, and chiefly all riuer fish: Crabs haue also a speciall propertie, vertue, and secret operation against this maladie. And if one cannot get Crabs, then take in the stead of them garden Snailes, and let them with their houses boile with Hyssop and Fennell, then take them out, and bestrew them with Sugar, or frie them with Butter, as it li∣keth the patient best, for they cause the flegme to arise, and moisten the bodie: all hearbes that moisten and coole are good for this disease; yea it behoueth that all the patients meate be drest with the same, as namely with Beetes, Lettice, Spinage, Burrage, Purslaine, Melons, and Shepheards purse, which haue a speciall operation for this sicknes in cooling and moistening. But Colewoorts and Turneps must he forbeare: Rice sod in water, wherein 24. houres be∣fore wheaten Bran hath bene stéeped, may he well feede vpon, for through the Branne doth the water get a cooling and moistning operation. So is there also good for this sicknesse, red and white Pease, notwithstanding that they be warme and drie in the first degree, which warmth and drouth is taken away by dressing. For amongst all kind of pottage, there is nothing more requisite than this for the Lights. But the auncient Phisitions do much commend stued Barly, Pusanam, of all other pottages, for it is light of digestion, slipperie, and looseth the phlegme very well; it altereth also the bad, drie, and aguish complexion. And albeit that Barley is hote and drie in the first degree, yet all such drouth is taken away through the moisture wherewith it is boyled, whether it be sodden and drest in water, Almond milke, or some fresh broth; for it is fa∣miliar to the stomacke, cleanseth the same, quencheth thirst, putrifieth not in the stomacke: for these vertues is Barly commended of all auncient and later Phisitions that are expert in phi∣sicke. So do they also commend Otemeale, which hath almost the same vertue, and is like to the Barly, but is not so common in vse, yet are the right Oatmeale paps very good, so are paps also of Beane meale, of Lentils, of rough bearded Wheate, of Starch drest with Almond milk, or the broth of Hens, as occasion shall serue. Aboue the foresaid fruits the Hasell nuts are tollerated and allowed of, yet but few, least they spoile the stomacke: vnsalted Chéese is very good for him, but old Chéese is highly forbid∣den, and albeit (euen as is sayd) milke is for meate tollerated, yet is not Butter, nor Hogs grease, neither Sallad oyle commendable for this disease: neither yet any meates which are drest with much fat. Oyle of swéete Almonds, and oile of Walnuts are accompted for the best, because that the other stuffe the head: all salted fish and flesh are hurtfull, like as be vineger, veriuice, and such like, and especially if there be salt in it: but if any of these be vsed, then delay the sharpnesse with Sugar; but swéet Pomgranats and Citrons well Sugred may he vse well enough. Hony is not good in his meate, although the same vsed after another manner be good and profitable, euen as is here before expressed. He must beware of all spice, vnlesse they be drest with some other cooling hearbes, as with Violet leaues, Purslaine, Spinage, Lettice, Endiue, and such like. But Saffron is much com∣mended for this disease, for it strengtheneth the hart, the breast, and clenseth the lungs. White Wine is good for his drinke, if it be cleare and somewhat swéete: but the sowre and hard wine harmeth him: if so be that the Wine do not fume into the head, then let him drinke it by it selfe, but if it be heady, then temper it with sodden water, or the water wherein Licorice, Buglosse, Elecampane, Folefoote leaues, and such like are decocted, this must be his drink at meales, but
if he drinke betwéene meales, then is he to drinke sugred Barly water. Here haue you now the second time a description of the sixe vnnaturall things, the which the Phisitions do call Res non naturales, like as the same are before set downe in the description of Asthma. Here do follow many remedies for this disease. TAke the tailes of fresh water Crabs sixe ounces, prepare and dresse them as is before in∣structed, the seedes of Endiue, of Sorrell, of small Endiue, and of Lettice one dragme and a halfe, Pingles that haue bene stéeped one night in Folefoote water two ounces, stampe & chop them all together, and séeth them with foure ounces of Sugar & Hony to a Confection. There is also another Confection made of Crabs,Looch de Can∣cris. called Looch de Cancris, as followeth: Take the tayles of good fat fresh water Crabs foure ounces, Raisins the stones taken out two oun∣ces, 30. Iuiubes, Licorice two ounces, Venus haire, Tassell leaues, Hounds toung, and Dill, of each one quarter of an ounce, séeth this all together in sufficient water to the halfe part, then wring it out, and put thereto sirupe of Poppy heads, and white Sugar, of each foure ounces, and when it is well clarified, and decocted to the thicknesse of Hony, then put vnto it sirupe of Licorice, Almonds chopt small, and Gourd séede, of each halfe an ounce, séeds of Mallows and Quinces, of each one quarter of an ounce, Purslaine and white Poppie séede, Dragagant, Gumme and Starch, of each one drag. powne all these small together, Species Diamoschu, and Diambra,Another Looch. of each one dragm, temper them all well together. Item, this Looch ensuing may also be prepared for this, the which is very good for the consumption, the drouth and heate of the throate: Take Licorice sliced, Raisins without stones, of each one ounce, Iuiubes and Sebe∣stes ten or twelue, séeth them all together in two quarts of water, that there remain not aboue the eighth part, then straine it through a cloth, and put thereto fiue ounces of sodden wine, Su∣gar pennets two ounces, and so let it seeth thicke together, whereof the patient is to take twice or thrice a day, and likewise in the night treatably, a small spoonefull at once, for this are also good Looch de Pino, De Farfaria, and Looch de Papauere. To these foresaid confections is this following highly commended: Take the iuice of Pim∣pernell, of Bistorta, or powders of the same, of each halfe an ounce, conserue of Roses one ounce and a halfe, temper them well together, and let them séeth ouer a small fire; or if it be hote wea∣ther, set it in the Sunne vntill it be thicke. About the Bistorta is a great debate amongst the learned,Bstorta. euery one may therefore looke vnto it that will. Item, the confection of Foxe lungs described before in the twelfth §. is speciall good for all such as haue the consumption, taking daily the quantitie of a Nutmeg. The operations that Treacle and Mithridate haue in this disease, are declared in many other places of the booke. The warme and cold Dragagant tabulats are also speciall good for the consumption, and that according to the importance of the same. Item, take eight ounces of Hens flesh which is sodden in Barly water, and as much Al∣monds, beate them all small together, and temper therewith one ounce and a halfe of Starch, and the whites of fiue egs well beaten, with foure ounces of beaten Sugar, temper them al to∣gether with Rose water, and let them séeth well without the Almonds and the Hennes flesh: when it beginneth to be thicke, then stirre the Almonds and the Hens flesh amongst it, and make morsels or small cakes thereof, and let them drie in an ouen. The confected Almonds are speciall good for all such as consume away, for they giue good nourishment; in like sort the con∣fected Pingles, if they be stéeped first 24. houres in Rose water. This following is a costly powder: Take white Poppy séede one ounce and a quarter, Starch and Dragagant of each thrée dragmes, péeled Melon seede, Pompeon séede, Cucumber séede, and péeled Gourd séedes, of each seauen dragmes, séedes of Purslaine and Mallowes, of each fiue dragmes, burnt Iuorie, and the iuice of Licorice, of each three dragmes, Sugar pennets, as much as of all the rest, make a powder thereof, and giue euery morning thereof one quarter of an ounce, with the sirupe of Poppie heads, or sirupe of Iuiubes; this is good against all vlce∣rations of the Lights, and against all Coughes, for that it is of wonderfull operation, yea also in them that do cough vp péeces of their Lights. If you will haue a powder of it for to strew vpon your meate, then put as much more Sugar vnto it. Item, take Lungwoort, and prepared Foxelights of each halfe an ounce, and two ounces of
Sugar, and make thereof a powder. And you may make these pils following for to lay vnder the tongue, which are very good against the Cough, and against the Ague: Take peeled Melon seede, Gourd séede, Cucumber seed, and péeled Pompeon séede, of each fiue dragms, white Pop∣pie seede, Purslaine seede, of each seuen dragms, Sugar pennets as much as all the rest weigh, muscilage of Quinces as much as néedeth for to make pils therewith. Item, conserues of Betonie, and conserues of Gillofloures (being both of one operation) are passing good against the consumption: The conserue of water Lillies cooleth maruellous well, and the wine thereof. In like manner Rosemarie wine, and of Clarie, are also good for this, euen as in the last part of this booke their operations are discouered. Here followeth also a precious Capon water which much strengtheneth the heart and resto∣reth all weaknesse: Take an old Capon, chop him small, and put vnto him Buglosse water, the water of Burrage and Dandelion, of Endiue, and Carduus Benedictus, of each eight or ten oun∣ces, grosse beaten Cinamome, and Pionie séed, of each halfe an ounce, Saffron and Nutmegs, of each one scrup. Roses, Mints, Sage, and floures of Burrage cut small, of each one handfull, Buglosse the root and herbe one ounce, Harts tongue, Violets and Rosemary flowers, of each halfe a handfull, Misselden of the oke halfe an ounce, let all this digest in a Stiller, and after∣wards distill it like other water, this is speciall good for children. These cold remedies following are very méete for a consuming body, which is hote and dry, to wit, conserues of Roses, sirupe of Poppy heads, Roses and Violets, Purslaine, cold Dra∣gagant tabulats, and the confection of Diarrhodon which is very temperate. Of warming reme∣dies if the patient be not too hote, like as in Asthma, these following are good, Diacuminum, Di∣aireos Solomonis, Dia Hyssopo, Dia Calamintha, Diaprassium. In like manner, the sirupe of al these aforesaid, also the sirupe of Licorice, Iuiubes, and Venus haire, but chiefly the last of them, which is not too hote. This patient ought alwaies as wel before as after meat to sit in a warme bath of water, and to sit therein so long vntill that the veines beginne to swell and grow big. Plaisters and Vnguents haue also good operation in this disease, to wit, such as hereafter insue: Take prepared Crabs tayles (as is taught before) twelue ounces, séedes of Endiue and of small Endiue, of Sorrell, of Lettice, of each one dragme and a halfe, Mace one quarter of an ounce, peeled Melon séede, Gourd séede, Cucumber séed, and peeled Pompeon seed, of each three dragmes. Pingles two ounces, beaten Sugar foure ounces, and Hony of Violets as much as needeth for to make a plaister, and so lay it warme vpon the breast. A good Oyntment. TAke the fat of a white Cat, Harts suet, Barrowes grease, the marrow of Harts bones, Dogs grease, and Badgers grease, of each one ounce, Hony two ounces; melt all these together on a mild fire: afterwards put thereto Beuercod and Euphorbium, of each halfe an ounce, long Pepper foure scruples; beate that small which is to be beaten small, and make thereof with sufficient Waxe and oile of Cammomill an oyntment. Some haue not without cause dried Betonie and field Cipers, stamping of each halfe an ounce, with three dragmes of Turpentine put vnto it: and as this vnguent is somwhat hote, so is this following temperat. Take one ounce and a halfe of the oile of Violets, fresh butter three quarters of an ounce: melt them and powre them into a mortar, and put thereto one ounce and a halfe of womans milke that hath a daughter sucking on her, stir it together vntill it be well tempered, and annoint the brest therewith, it is good against heate, it swageth and looseth flegme: therefore it is also good in Asthma and Hectica. Item, take the whole purtenance with hart, lights and liuer as it hangeth together of a blacke Calfe, chop it together very small, and distill it in a glasse helme in seething water, you may take thereof as much as you will, and temper amongst it as much Nettle wa∣ter as of the former, and rub therewith the withered members. If so be then the marrow in the bones do also wither away (as is admonished at the first) then take a Fole of a yeare old, let it be killed, fleyed and all the bones cut in peeces: take the marrow out: then take washt Turpentine, Hounds grease, and Harts suet, of each halfe an ounce, cut and melt the marrow, but the skin that sticketh to the bottome preserue that alone: for being powdered it is good for all sores, the molten marrow keepe still in the pan, and temper
one with another as long as an egge may be sod, and let it coole: you may take thereof the big∣nes of a Walnut, and annoint your selfe twice a day therewith, on the hands and side, and els∣where if it be néedfull. It is also to be noted, that there is another sort of Consumption called Febris Hectica, which procéedeth also of this contagion of the Lights, but we will speake further thereof in the sixt part, where we do treate of all other sorts of Agues, as also of other witherings of the mem∣bers, of lamenesse, and the Poxe, in the fourth Chapter of this booke. Of the stinking breath in Phthisis, or the Consumption. §. 24. OF all the former diseases and putrifactions of the Lights, it is easily to be vn∣derstood, from whence the breath hath his beginning and whence it stinketh, and that it cannot be amended, if the disease whereby it is corrupted be not ta∣ken away and cured; whereof is spoken more at large in the first part, the 13. Chapter, and §. 3. therefore we will speake more briefly of it: for which Master Tristrams water is very good. Likewise the iuice of Wormwood tempered with Vineger, and the mouth washt therewith. Confected Calmus, Elecampane and Citron pils, are also very good with their sirupes. In the first part the twelfth Chapter, and 1. §. is a pow∣der set downe which beginneth thus, Take Sene, &c. Annis and Fennell séedes confected, and such like, do also take away the stinking breath: the which also do swéet and bitter Almonds, be they confected or no. But héede must be taken for the consumption, that no laske or fluxe happen with it: and if such do happen, then is this powder following to be vsed. Take Gum of Araby, burnt Iuory, fine Bolus, and Myrtle séede, of each a like much, make therof a powder, and minister thereof euery day as long as is very néedfull, thrée dragmes at a time, with sirupe of Poppie heads and Myrtles. For to conclude this Chapter of the Lights, we will adde hereunto certaine néedfull and ne∣cessarie things: to wit, the medicines which by nature voluntarily ease the Lights, as Ireos, Hyssope, Licorice, Raisins, Venus haire, Squils, Saunders, Pingles, Foxelights, Horehound, Hony, Sugar, Dragagant, Fenegréeke, Barley, Saffron, Ameos, Colewoort broth, the broth of an old stued Cock, Cherries, Lignum Aloes, Hasell nuts, Opopanacum, Serapinum, Myrrha, Ra∣dishes, Daffodill rootes, Lilly rootes, Frankinsence. These things following do cleanse the Lights and the Breast; as Agaricus, Hyssope, Woodbind, Sarcocolla, Cassia, Ireos, Coloquint, the confection of Diasena, and the pils Cochiae. These things following do strengthen and warme the breast and the Lights, as Hyssope, Horehound, Ireos, Elecampane rootes, Cammomill, Hollihocke rootes, Currans, Squils, Bal∣sam wood, Myrrha, Serapinum, Lilly rootes, Venus haire, Licorice, Indy Spica: and amongst the compounded things are Diacalaminthum, Diaprassium, Diahyssopum, Ireos tabulates, the confe∣ction of Pingles and Looch de Pino. For the cooling of the breast these things, Iuiubes, Sebestes Dragagant, Gum of Araby, Starch, and white Poppy séede, swéet Almonds, Violets, Sugar candy, Mulberries, Saunders, Sugar, &c. Of the compounded things, the confection Diapapa∣uere, cold Dragagant, Sallads, Sugar pennets, and other things more: that with many more are described before. We must note further, that although the disease of children, which is called the infection of the heart be a malady of the Lights, and a kind of Consumption, yet for some causes it is descri∣bed in this Chapter following. The sixt Chapter. Of the Hart, the most precious part of mans body. ALl they that are expert in naturall things, or in Philosophie, do write, that the Hart is the first member that is found in all liuing bodies; and in like maner the last that dieth of all other parts of a liuing body: the which is very well to be beléeued, for that it is a perfect fountain & ofspring of life, & of all naturall heat; and is also it selfe hoter than any other member: therefore in all beasts it is set in the middest of their bodies, that it might warme the bloud, spread the same
abroade ouer all the whole body, and thereby preserue life right in the middle of the breast, (which is contained in this second Part of this booke.) The Hart hath his place in mens bodies, but with his picked end tendeth towards the left side, and left nipple: therefore do the com∣mon people suppose that the hart lyeth in the left side. Out of this springeth first the vitall spirits, Spiritus vitales, which with a continuall stirring and mouing preserue it, and that with such force, that the same being out of the body, yet it for∣cibly stirreth and goeth vp and downe, euen as one may specially see by the harts of the Salmon and Sturgeon. Through which continuall stirring from this place, it doth communicate his motion through all the Arteries, and also the life it selfe vnto the whole body, the which is to be knowen by this, that when the same is infected with any impostume, or with any weapon neuer so little pierced, that forthwith the vitall spirits, yea life it selfe must depart out of the bo∣dy; like as is dailie séene by the like experience of the harts of all beasts which are killed, whereas the hart being found sound, so soone as the same is neuer so little touched or stirred, that then all warmth and helpe is taken from all other members, whereupon immediatly death ensueth, and is none otherwise but as if ones hart be not before harmed. Item, this hart is also the dwelling place of all inclinations of the mind, as mirth, vexation, sorrow, feare, care, hope, loue, hate, anger, malice, mercie, sufferance, or forbearance, and such like. Fourthly, appeare in the Hart such diuersities of affections, with such a force and vertue, that if the one do raigne aboue the other, the same draweth such an humor vnto it, as is most acceptable for it: As anger draweth vnto it Cholera, mirth discusseth the blood ouer the whole body, and through feare and fright hasteneth it towards the hart: in great sorrow and vexa∣tion it draweth the melancholicke blood vnto it, &c. How were it then possible to expresse all the causes of these and of other more wonderfull passions of the hart? yet haue many renowmed and learned men written very amply thereof, whose bookes may be read and perused. Also it is certaine, that all bodies, which haue great harts, are fearefull, and faint harted, for that they haue not so much heate as is néedfull for them. Contrariwise, all small harts, which draw the heate the better togither are stout and valiant: This may well be vnderstood of great and spongeous harts, which are not so wide, nor filled with so many vitall spirits: like as are other great and compacted harts, that be hot, and filled with vitall spirits, then can they not otherwise but shew themselues manly and couragious, like as the common prouerbe saith, he hath a great Hart. The Hart hath some fatnesse on the top, yet in leane bodies very little, but in fat bodies somewhat more, the which is ordained by nature therewith to moisten the Hart, that through his continuall stirring it should not be so sore dried. Likewise it hath otherwhiles a thick fleshie skin which lieth round about the hart, and sometimes waxeth almost as hard as a bone, the which the Grecians call Pericardion, and we the closet of the hart, and hath such moisture in it, like as it were vrine, yea otherwhiles like as it were with a swéete deaw. And when as this moysture commeth to drie vp, like as it happeneth in them that consume or liue in great sor∣row, then must death follow after it. Like as to the contrarie doth come to passe, when there is too much of this foresaid moisture, that thereby is caused the panting of the Hart, and distem∣perature of the vitall spirits. It were here too long to rehearse all the signes of a hot, cold, drie and moyst Hart, or of a cold and drie, hot and moyst, cold and moyst, or hot and drie: all the which are intemperatures or Intemperies: of which is spoken in the first part and 1. §. We will also touching this, recommend the Reader to Galen, who hath at large discoursed of these Intemperies. But I must adioyne thereto thrée things which concerne the hart, whereof the hart of them that dyed of Cardiaca or swouning, or their harts that dyed through poyson cannot be burnt. Secondly, the foolish fantasie of the Egyptians, that were of opinion, that mens harts do euery yeare augment one quarter of an ounce, and that during fiftie yeares, and that after∣wards from yeare to yeare it did abate as much againe, which was the cause that men could not liue aboue one hundreth yeares. Thirdly, that the heathen of their offred beasts (and also Iulianus the Emperour that fell from Christ) do maruellously seduce people and perswade, that all things to come may thereby be knowne, whereof we will speake no more at this present. We will now procéede with our
intent, and treate of all the diseases and accidents of the hart, and do teach thereby how the same are to be holpen and cured. And albeit touching this there be many maladies and acci∣dents described by the learned, yet we wil neuertheles briefely rehearse only of the faintnes of the heart, of whatsoeuer cause that it may procéede, as swouning, quaking and panting, be it through heate or cold; amongst which may be contayned all accidents and maladies which are incident vnto the hart, and lastly adde thereto of the maladie which is commonly called, the griping of the hart. Of the fainting of the Hart in generall. §. 1. EVen as the Hart is the most principall and pretious part of the bodie, so doth the same declare that there is the more care and prouidence to be had, for to auoyd and take away his maladies, for to cure all that which hurteth it, and to preferre all that helpeth; and to obtaine the same, thus do the learned write these common rules hereafter following. First, that with expedition some good meanes and counsell be vsed and had against all that might happen vnto the hart, for to expell the matter which is cause thereof, for that there is no part of the body which may tollerate lesse delay of helpe. Secondly, for other members which haue any disease, there one thing is commaunded, ano∣ther forbidden, so that thereby no hurt might happen, which neuertheles is not so duly obser∣ued, as whensoeuer is giuen to one that hath the Ague, Wine or Flesh, which notwithstanding is clerely forbidden: but this must be more strictly obserued in the infirmities of the hart, by reason that it is much more néedfull for to strengthen the same as can be best, and to comfort it. Thirdly, if any member be by nature hote, and yet there striketh more heate vnto it, then must a great cooling be vsed: but one may not do so to the hart, whereto lesse or smaller things be vsed, neither yet to delay it so long, before you séeke remedie to cure it, as shall be hereafter declared in the eight and ninth instructions. Fourthly, the parts that are helpers of the motions and actions of the whole bodie, must not at any hand be touched with any strong purgation, so that thereby the same parts, and conse∣quently the whole body be not ouerweakened, the which must so be obserued in the hart, by reason that the same doth procure all actions of the whole bodie. Fiftly, for that the diseases of the hart are caused for the most part of bloud and winde, there∣fore is Phlebotomy much better for it then purging: but if the maladie procéede of bloud, then must the Liuer veine be opened on the right side; if of winde, then is the Liuer veine on the left side to be opened. Sixtly, if that purging medicines must néedes be vsed; then is there alwayes to be put there∣to that which may comfort the hart, as hereafter shal be taught, thereby to strengthen the same, and to preserue it, by reason that all purging mdicines are not a little contrary to the hart. Seuenthly, it must be narrowly looked vnto what part of mans bodie doth send these hu∣mors towards the hart & causeth this maladie, for to make readie the purgation accordingly, and to adde the cordiall things vnto it, as hath béene sayd. Eightly, if that the Hart haue gotten a bad hot complexion, that the same must be cooled, then is to be tempered amongst the cooling medicines some warming things: for if nothing but only cold things were vsed, then might perchance the naturall heate be quenched, and the patient killed. Ninthly, the cause of this mixture of cold and warme things is; for that cold things are commonly of no force or power without the help of warme things, to penetrate to the Hart. As for example, the Saffron is therefore added to the Trociscos de Camphora. For that all which shall here afterwards be written of the maladie of the Hart, is no other thing but a faintnes, whereof the one is greater and the other lesser than another, like as Lipo∣thymia and Syncope, it is néedfull to write of their differences. Lipothymia is a swouning or defect of minde, which sometimes is but small and sometimes great, and is soone ended: contrarywise Syncope commeth suddenly vpon one, and that with such vehemencie, that he can neither féele, sée, nor heare, so that betwéene death and him there is no other difference, then that as yet he hath some breath.
Notwithstanding is the Lipothymia not so little to be regarded, but that spéedily helpe must be had for it, for that it may quickly turne into Syncope. But before all things shall euery one know, that both these tremblings of the heart, haue so great acquaintance with the panting of the hart, that many Phisitions haue comprehended them vnder one title, as the remedies described euery where do testifie the same: but that they haue made many necessarie differences betweene hote and cold swounings, and first to write of the foresaid small swouning, or defect of minde, which taketh one vnawares, therefore are these things following to be vsed which do strengthen and warme the hart, as Balme, Bur∣rage, Rosemary, Basill, Penniroyall, Marierom, Wormewood, and specially marrish Mints. Of rootes, Cipers rootes, Zeduary, Costus, Ginger, Elecampane rootes, both the Béetes rootes, and Doronicum. Of seedes, Ameos, Smallage seede, Annis seede. Of Spices, Cardamome, Nut∣megs, Lignum Aloe, Saffron, Cucubes, Cloues. Item, take Muscus, Ambra, Harts bones, Citron pils, Mastick, Myrrhe, Blattae Byzantiae, good and pleasant tasting Wine. Item, take these warming confections following, as Diamargariton Calidum, Diacinamomum, Diapliris, Laetificans, Dia Moschu, Diambra, Aromaticum Rosatum, which is of a temperate nature, Treacle, Mithridate, confected Citron pils, confected Elecampane rootes, and other things moe that do follow afterwards. These things are of a temperate nature, as Iacint, Smaragdes, Saphirs, Rubies, Perles, Corrall, Gold, Siluer, Amber, Mirobalanes Bellerici, Buglosse, silke wormes nests, burnt Iuorie, Barberies, Tormentill, Harts bones, and Saffron. To coole the hart, take Melon séede, Pompeon séede, Cucumber séede, Gourd seede, the seedes of Fleawort, Sorrell séede, prepared Coriander, Pomgranats, Lymons, Citrons, and their iuice, Quinces, sowre Apples, Peares, Raspes, new and dry Prunes, and all pleasant sauouring fruites, water Lilly floures, the iuice of the Vyne, Vineger, Roses, Violets, shauen and burnt Iuorie, all kinde of Saunders, Amber, and sealed earth. Of compounds, is the confection of Diarrhodon Abbatis, Triasantalon, Manus Christi with Perles, Diamargariton frigidum, Trocisci de Camfora, conserue of Roses, of Violets, Sirupe of Raspes, Lymons, Violets, Roses, water Lillyes, Vineger, and Oxysacchara, and all that you shall finde written hereafter. Moreouer, there are hereafter set downe diuers confecti∣ons, that comfort the hart in heate and cold. The order of life or diet for this faintnes of the Hart. A Bad stomacke is otherwhiles no small cause of this swouning, for it procureth before the swouning come a heate ouer the whole bodie. As soone as this shall be perceiued, it is not amisse to vse for it confected Balsam wood, but in the stead thereof take Tabu∣lates of Xyloaloe, which are very requisite for this. Secondly, he is to take euery morning one dragme of fine Treacle, which must be twelue yéeres old, with Rose water, of the confection of Muscus, Diamoschu dulcis, he is to drinke of it oftentimes with Basill water one quarter of an ounce at a time, but that which concerneth the stomack shall follow hereafter. Fourthly, this patient is to haue hanging about his neck a good Smaragde stone, or at the least selected Cor∣rall. Fiftly, take one dragme and a halfe of Rose buds which are not fully blowen, Vine leaues, red and white Behen, floures and séedes of Basill, barke of Frankinsence, Marierom gentle, of each one dragme, Balme one dragme and a halfe, Camfer one scruple, Amber halfe a scruple, Muske two graines, each beaten by it selfe, and being bounden in a péece of silke, are to be smelt vnto oftentimes: but if the faintnes be not holpen thereby, and that it be feared that he will be more fainter, then must those things be vsed against the swouning that are described here∣after. But for the first, you are to vse these cordiall waters and plaisters following: Take Balme water twelue ounces, Rose water, Violet water, the water of Willow leaues, and of wilde Vine leaues, of each sixe ounces, burnt Iuorie, Roses, red and white Saunders, Harts bones, seeds and leaues of Basill, of each two scruples, Muske two graines, Amber fiue graines, Mus∣cadell two ounces, let all these séethe togither about one quarter of an hower (except the Muske and Amber) make then a péece of red Scarlet cloth wet therein, one quarter of a yard square: wring it warme out, and lay it fower or fiue times in an hower vpon the hart. A spoonge may
also be laid in this water, and smelt vnto oftentimes: for both of them do maruellously comfort the Hart. If so be that the swouning doth not yet cease, then take two ounces of this foresaid powder, and temper amongst it as much Barly meale, one scruple of Saffron, and séeth it with good old wine vntill it be reasonable thick, temper it well in a morter with foure leaues of beaten gold, and one dragme of prepared Pearles, spread these vpon a péece of red Scarlet cloth, and then lay it on the left breast. This is approoued to be maruellous good, and to haue sometimes holpen such a griefe within one quarter of an hower, and sustained the sicke person by his strength. Of Syncope the great Swouning. §. 2. THe second and sorest swouning of the Hart is called Syncope, and is thus descri∣bed: Syncope is a distraction of all féeling and stirring of the whole body, with extreme faintnes. Amongst many other inward causes whereof, are these: re∣ceiuing of any pestilent or other stinking aire, whether it be in time of the plague, or of the stench of any hollow caues, or of the byting of any venemous beasts, as of Scorpions, mad dogs, and venemous fumes of mettals, like as in the melting often happeneth: of great feare and frighting, of former diseases, as of the dead palsie, the pleurisie, inflammation of the lights, suffocation of the mother, of wormes, of ouer-watchings, of many laskes, of much bléeding, of great hunger, of much smarting, of great paine, yea also of great ioy, & other strong motions of the minde. So that this great swouning hath great familiaritie with the dead palsie: albeit there be a difference, whereof we are to speake. If any get the palsie, then remaineth his face by good semblance: but in this swouning it is like to a dead bodie. For in this swouning, all the blood runneth towards the Hart, so that the patient remaineth without any feeling, and in such an estate, that no man can tell whether he be dead or liuing: so that there is a common prouerbe of it, That such dead men ought not to be buried in thrée daies. Secondly, they are like one to the other, in that neither breath nor pulse is perceiued. Thirdly, in the palsie the patient féeleth before a heauinesse in the head, but not in the Syn∣cope: neuerthelesse they accord in this, that the affected partie lieth as though he were dead. But in this swouning it is certaine, if it come after a long panting of the hart, and continu∣eth long then it is a messenger of death, and chiefly if there be Ellebor blowen into the patients nose, and it doth not stir and mooue him at all. The signes of the swouning to come, of what cause soeuer it be prouoked, are sweating and panting of the Hart, a slowe and feeble pulse, bleaknes of the lips and face, chilnesse of the out∣ward members, numnesse of the sense of féeling and moouing: where these signes appéere, there a strong swouning draweth néere, and there is néede of good counsell. First, and with spéede, when the swouning approcheth or is extant, then is the patient to be spouted in the face with Rose water, or (if that be not ready to be had) with cold Well water, and it will be the better if there be a little Muske tempered amongst it: for thereby will the na∣turall heate be driuen inwardly, and the vital spirits reuiued. Stop also his nose and his mouth a little while: for if the breath finde no vent, then turneth it backe, and thereby quick∣neth the naturall heate. Secondly, his armes are to be bound hard, and then made loose, and bound hard againe. The palmes of the hands and plants of the féete are well to be rubbed with rawe clothes, salt and vineger, to the end that the matter may be drawen from the hart. Thirdly, his stomacke and about the mouth of the stomacke is also to be well rubbed, where∣by the naturall heate may be quickened. All fragrant herbes, which are hot of nature, are to be holden before his nose, as all kinds of Spice, Muske and Amber, if so be that the cause of this matter be cold. But for women that do fall into swouning through the suffocation of the Mother, it is ano∣ther case, as shall be shewed elsewhere, for that all odoriferous things are hurtfull to be holden before their noses. A graine of Muske dissolued in Wine and then giuen, is passing good. And if the patient haue vehemently closed his mouth, then is the same to be broken open with a woo∣den sticke, and his toong, téeth, and roufe of the mouth to be annointed with Treacle or Mithri∣date.
But if the cause be through heate, then must the patient haue cold things giuen him to smell vnto, as Camfer, Saunders, Roses, and such like here before expressed. And of what cause soeuer this swouning doth come, yet is it alway good that there be made a great noyse about the patient, and that he be called vpon by his name, and blow Campher in his nose, or Saun∣ders in stead thereof: these are now the commonest meanes, if the swouning be procured through heate or cold, that are to be vsed at a sodaine. Secondly, all the windowes are to be set open, that then the patient may be refreshed with the fresh ayre, and they are to speake very friendly vnto him. Also you are to annoynt his pulse, nose, and temples, with the foresaid things, and giue him all comfortable things, as is before sayd, that nature may thereby be strengthened and quickned. An order of life for Swouning. FIrst, all men that are subiect to this swouning, must beware of all cloudie, moyst, and cold ayre, and shun such like dwellings, must suffer no sweate vpon the head, must cast off all sweatie shirts, and put on cleane: he must forbeare all moyst and cold meates, as Spi∣nage, Béetes, Lettice, Purslaine, Endiue, Cherries, hasell Nuts, Abricocks, Cucumbers, and such like, but new Figs are good for him. Further, he must be kept from all grosse binding meates, from all that is made of dough, from all Fish, as Eeles, Tenches, and all great corpu∣lent Fish. But Crabs and small Fishes which are taken in fresh waters he may eate, being a little broyled. He must also eschue all old and fat flesh, Chéese and such like. He must vse for his drinke all cléere white Wine that is not swéete, or a good old mild sort of Béere: he must wholly forbeare drinking of water: he must not ouercharge his stomacke with eating and drinking, but chew his meate well, and leaue off eating with appetite. He must not sléepe after meate, or at least not too long. He must walke well two howres before meate, yea runne vp hils, for that consumeth well the moysture whereof the swouning is prouoked. He must specially flye all anger, sorrow, vexation, and other troubles of the minde, as is sufficiently declared before. But what medicines are to be vsed for the swouning, shall be héere taught: the patient must as soone as is possible, take these pils following in the morning betimes. Take pils of Rubarb one dragme, Hiera composita one scruple, make nine pils thereof with Rose water, afterwards giue him this drinke following 6. daies one after another: Take halfe a drag. of Agaricke, Hermodactili, and Rubarb, of each one scruple, Diagridij, and Sal Gemmae, of each two graines, Ginger, Squinant, Spica, and Annis séede, of each thrée graines, Hony of Roses halfe an ounce, let it stéepe one whole night in thrée ounces of water wherein Woodbinde is sodden, afterwards let it séethe a walme, and straine it out. For to make pils, take good Aloes two ounces, Mastick, Saffron, Violets, and floures of Buglosse, of each halfe a scruple, burnt Iuorie and Roses, of each three graines, Diagridion seuen graines, Agaricke, Turbith, and pre∣pared Asure stone, of each halfe a dragme: stéepe it all together with Cicorie water thrée daies long, and (being well stopt) let it dry in the Sunne, or in another warme place, yet stirring it often about vntill it be méetely thicke: take then a dragme thereof, and make thereof seuen pils, whereof euery euening you are to take one pill a certaine time long, afterwards a whole yéere thorow take one pill about the fift day: but if the patient be full of bloud, and of sufficient strength, then are you after purging to open the Liuer veine in the elbow on the left side, and to let him bléede about fiue ounces. For to kéepe open the body, you are to vse this powder: Take Epithymum, rootes of Polipody, Thymus, Harts toong, and Cuscuta, of each one dragme, Argall and Seny, of each halfe a dragme, Mace foure scruples, stamp and mingle it all together, take one dragme thereof at the least twice a wéeke at one time, tempered with a little wine, or some fresh broth: it purifieth, brea∣keth winde, and clenseth the hart and stomacke. Item, take at the least (once a wéeke) as much Pieretrum as the bignes of a Pease, chue the same, and spet the moysture out of the mouth. Another. TAke a good péece of white bread, mollifie it in good Muscadell or Malmsey, if so be that the cause of this swouning be of cold: but if it procéede of heate, then mollifie the same white bread in Rose water, in iuice of Pomgranats, in iuice of Quinces, in ye iuice of Citrons,
or any flesh broth, and so eate it. Also this patient may vse conserue of Roses, Burrage, Bu∣glosse, and Rosemary, and other things moe, which shall be expressed hereafter in the trembling of the hart, after that heate or cold hath the vpper hand. There are yet many moe confections and cordiall things prepared, which are very profita∣ble for this purpose, and do remaine described before in the discourse of the cold paine of the head where it beginneth, Take conserues of Betony &c. Item take Pistacia thrée ounces, white Sugar sixe ounces, sirupe of Roses fower ounces, séeds of Basill, red and white Corall, Roses, burnt Iuory, red and white Behen, of each one drag. Zeduary, Amber, and Saffron, of each two scruples, Iacint, Smaragde, and Saphire, of each halfe a scruple, Mace, Cinnamom, and Cloues, of each one drag. sixe leaues of beaten gold, Pearles fower scruples: the Pistacia stéepe (being cut small) thrée dayes long in Malmesey: afterwards séeth the sirupe and the Sugar thicke enough, and first temper therein the moist Pistacia, and afterwards the rest beaten small, whereof is to be taken the space of sixe weekes euery morning the bignes of a Walnut. This powder following is to be strewed vpon the meate: Take Cinnamom halfe an ounce, Saffron one dragme, Zeduary thrée quarters of an ounce: beate and mixe them all togither. The Ze∣duary hath a speciall power for to strengthen the Hart. And there is to be drest alwaies in his meate Buglosse and Baulme. Cordiall waters.To this end are prepared diuers cordiall waters, as hereafter followeth: Take Cinnamom and Cloues, of each one ounce and a halfe, Nutmegs one ounce, red and white Roses, of each ten handfuls, Lauander flowers seuen handfuls, hyssope two handfuls; powre then thereupon a quart of Malmesey: temper them all together, cut them small, and let it so stand nine daies together, and afterwards distill it. Item, take good wine fiue quarts, two rases of Ginger, fortie Cloues, Cinnamom thrée quarters of an ounce, Mace one quarter of an ounce, Spike two handfuls: If you will haue it more forcible, then put two Nutmegs cut vnto it, let it steepe all togither sixe or seuen wéekes long, and afterwards distill it. Thus haue the auncient Phi∣sitions done. Or, take fower quarts of good wine, Spike thrée handfuls, gréene Marierom gentle two handfuls, Mace, Cloues, Cinnamom, and Nutmegs, as much as you thinke good: temper them togither, and set them a whole moneth long in the Sun in a glasse: This may you kéepe so, or distill it. Another. Take Lauander thrée handfuls, stéepe it in a pint of wine, or Malmesey, stop it tight; then set it for the space of thirty dayes in the Sun, and afterwards distill it. Of all these foresaid waters may a little be giuen him when he beginneth to get the swouning, or hath the same already. This iuice following is iustly praised: Take a Capon or a Partridge, rost it lei∣surely, baste it with Rose water and Muscadell, or any other good wine wherein Cloues haue béene stéeped; then presse the iuice out of the said bird, and giue him some thereof, and the rest let him eate now and then some. And that this iuice may continue good the longer, temper it with as much hard Sugar as you thinke good. But will you haue another? then wring likewise as much iuice out of a Pullet, or out of yoong Kids flesh, take two ounces thereof, new pressed iuice of Quinces one ounce and a halfe, and one ounce of good milde wine; temper them all togither, and giue the patient to eate thereof. For this is also commodious all Aquae Compositae, which are described in the eighth Part. For this swouning may be vsed outward remedies after many maners: first, through shields: Take Burrage flowers, and Violets, of each one handfull,Cordiall shields. red and white Saunders, red and white Corall, red and white Behen, and Roses, of each one dragme, Saffron halfe a dragme, burnt red Silke 15. graines, Camfers, Muscus, Ambra, of each two graines, poune them all together, and mixe them in a red silken bag, and so lay it on your left breast. Another. Take Ireos halfe an ounce, tame or wild Baulme, Citron pils, Buglosse flowers of each one dragme, Mace one quarter of an ounce, yellow, white and red Saunders, and Lig∣num Aloes, of each halfe a dragme; temper them with the powder of the capitall bags, which are described in the first Part, the twelfth Chapter, in the beginning, where is mention made of the Braines: take thereof as much as is néedefull for a bag to lay on the Hart. The same is also wonderfull good in time of the plague, being laid vpon the Hart. Item, take Ireos three ounces and a halfe, Damaske Roses sixe ounces, Marierom, Cipers rootes, and red Styrax, of each halfe an ounce, Cloues one quarter of an ounce, Calmus halfe a dragme, Muscus two graines, vsed as aboue.
This following is a very precious cordial shield: Take Burrage flowers, Buglosse flowers, red and white Saunders, red and white Behen, Nutmegs, and Couchenell, Lignum Aloes, Saffron, Seduary, white Diptamus, Cucubes, Basill seede, Baulme, and Citron pils, of each halfe a dragme, Galliae muscaae one scruple, Muscus and Ambra, of each sixe graines, beate them all together grosse, and put it into a red Crimson bag, and lay it ouer the breast. Here follow diuers moe. Take Iuniper berries, powre thereto water of Sage, poune them to pap, and then bind it luke warme vpon the Pulse. Item take Cinnamom, Mace, Saffron, Cloues, as many as you will, put Malmesey vnto them, and lay it all vpon the Pulse. Take vnpouned Saffron, fasten it in the left hand one hower at the least; it strengtheneth much the Hart. Take cleane burnt Baulme, Peniroyall, Cloues, water of Sage, and Roses; temper them, and annoynt therewith the patient, especially on the Pulses, vnder the nose, and vpon the temples of his head. The auncient Phisitions do rub the hart with fresh Burrage flowers; it is very good, but it is very weake. All odoriferous things which are hot by nature, are to be vsed against the swouning through heate. But Hyssope is chiefly to be commended for it, and all those who are subiect to this swouning are counselled to smell oft vnto it. This Baulme following was ordained for the Emperor Ferdinandus:A precious Balme to comfort the Hart, first or∣dained for the Emperor Ferdinandus. Take a pound of Turpentine, sixe ounces of Virgin honie, twelue ounces of water of life, euen as hereafter be diuers described in the eight part, Lignum Aloes, Turbith, yellow Saunders, Sage, rootes of blew Flower deluce, and Chamedrys, of each one dragme, Nutmegs, Galingall, Cucubes, Cin∣namom, Masticke, Frankinsence, Cloues, Spica, white Mustard seede, Saffron, Ginger, Rue séedes, and Costemary rootes, of each thrée dragmes, Muske one dragme, Amber one quarter of an ounce; beate them all grosse togither, and let it stéepe all togither one day and a night in the water of life. But the Muske and the Amber are to be broken alone in some Muscadell wine. Lastly, temper the Turpentine therewith, and distill it in séething water. A good Salue. TAke Amber, Zeduarie, red and white Corall, Blaettae Bysantiae, Basill séede, red and white Behen, and Rosemary flowers, of each one dragme and a halfe, Mace one quarter of an ounce, Sorrell, small Endiue and Cicorie, of each halfe an ounce, Roses and water Lil∣lies, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Rosin one ounce and a halfe, Laudanum halfe an ounce, white Waxe thrée dragms; melt the thrée last things togither, and as they begin to be cold, then mingle the rest amongst it: afterwards let it be spread on a round cloth, and layd vpon the left breast. If it be too hard, then make it softer with oyle of Roses; both which are good (as is said) against the swouning and faintnes of the Hart. Yet is the Balsam much hotter then the salue, for it is temperate, and therefore you may know how to vse it accordingly. When you haue made it softer, then annoint the whole breast therewith. This capitall powder following may also be vsed for this: Take Indie Spica, Ameos, Bay berries, Marierom gentle, of each one dragme, Lignum Aloes one dragme and a halfe; beate all apart, and mixe them togither with fiue graines of this powder: You must euery euening when you goe to bed strewe it on your head. Of the beating or panting of the Hart. §. 3. THe Grecians do call this disease Palmos, the Latinists Palpitatio, Tremor, or Saltus Cordis, which is a trembling or panting of the Hart, contrarie to the common custome. It is caused (euen as we haue taught in the beginning of this Chap∣ter) of the abundant moysture which is in the closet of the Hart. With these there may be yet moe other inward causes, as the paine of the sto∣mack, vexation & offence of the Hart, of the Liuer, the Lights, the Milt, or Mo∣ther: Also of winde, ill damps, corrupted blood, & such like. The outward causes are commonly great heate, sodaine and great cold, great emptines, great sorrowe, fright, great feare, and other motions of the minde: Further, of venime taken, biting of venimous beasts, pestilent Agues, corrupted ayre, stinking dwellings; like as in prison, Mines, or other such like, which are vnder the earth: of belly wormes, and all other things that vexe the Hart, the which
are well to be vnderstood of the patient himselfe. The inward signes are these: If the panting of the hart procéede of wormes, then is the beating of the hart bigger before meate then after: but if the same come of a bad stomacke, then may it easily be marked through paine in the same place, if the same be wroong: Also by the wambling and vomiting: If it come by fulnes of the same, then is the disease most grieuous after meate; but if through emptines, then it is most sore before meate. If it procéede of fright, sorrow, and such like, you must vnderstand and learne that by the patient: If it come of winds, then it is very suddenly vpon one, and soone gone away againe. If it be prouoked of heate, then is the pulse swift, and the breath is strong, and disordred. If it procéede of bloud, then is the vrin grosse, and the pulse beateth spéedily and strong, his face will be red, and about the hart is al∣wayes great heate, the patient is alwayes light harted, the which is much augmented through meates that make and ingender much bloud. Or if this disease be caused of Cholera, then is his vrin yellow and thin, the pulse beateth continually, swiftly, with great thirst, possibly through daily meate, whereby the Cholera is increased, or of former paines taken. If this be caused of Phlegma, that appeareth by the white and thick vrin, of small, slow, and disordred pulse, the pa∣tient is sléepie & faint-harted. This is also woont to be caused of meates that procure Phlegma. Likewise in winter time, when this panting of the hart is caused of Melancholy, then is the sick bodie fearefull, the bodie decreaseth, and falleth away, and that most of all in Haruest, with many moe melancholick signes that are elsewhere described. This panting of the hart doth often haunt both yong and aged people, whereby the occasion is hardly to be adiudged: and in all such it is found, that the letting of bloud hath not only eased them well, but also throughly holpen them, and chiefely if therewith they haue obserued a good order in eating and drinking, and vse all such medicines as haue abated the bloud and other humors: howbeit the same hap∣neth very seldome that aged people be cured thereof, for that they most of all chaunce to dye of a hote Ague, or of swouning, and that commonly betweene fortie and fiftie yéeres. Thus much for the beating or trembling of the hart. Of the panting of the Hart through heate. §. 4. IF by the panting of the hart there be discerned a swift pulse, and an Ague, then is it a signe yt it commeth of bloud or Cholera, the which is not without danger: for it often hapneth, that then they do fall into a swoune, & thereby immediatly remaine dead. Now for to remedie this, must the sick persons face, hands, féete, and pulse veines be forthwith sprinckled and rubbed with these compounded waters: take Rose water foure ounces, Mints water two ounces, Roses, burnt Iuorie, red & white Saunders, of each two scruples, Muscus and Ambra, of each two graines, Vineger two ounces, Malmesey two scruples, mixe them all together, and when you will vse thereof, then stirre it well about. Secondly, take pleasant Wine, and water of Buglosse, of each one ounce, Specierum Diamoschu dulci one scruple, temper it, and giue it to the patient warme to drinke. Thirdly, he shall cōtinually smell to odoriferous bags, that shall hereafter be described. Afterward, as soone as is possible, ought the Liuer veine be opened in the right arme, and foure or fiue ounces of bloud be letten out, but not before that the sick person hath gone to stoole. The next day following, he shall take this potion: take sirupe of Citron pils one ounce, small beaten Rubarb, and prepared Agarick, of each two scruples, sirupe of Roses halfe an ounce, Ginger and Spica, of each sixe graines, Sal Gemmae two graines, temper them all together with thrée ounces of the water of Burrage, and so drinke it luke warme, and fast thereupon foure howres. You may also cause him to be purged with Cassia, Tamarines, yellow Mirobalanes, Man∣na, and Rubarb, putting to either of them some Agarick. As for example, you may take this Purgation following: Take water of Buglosse one ounce and a halfe, Cicorie water two oun∣ces, Rubarb one dragme and a halfe, prepared Agarick one dragme, the iuice of Roses halfe a dragme, Spica one scruple, Ginger fiue graines: let this stéepe 24. howres in a warme place, and making it hote in the morning you must straine it through a cloth, and so drinke it warme, and then fast foure howres after. This being done, he must eight dayes one after another, take euery morning this drinke following: Take sirup of Apples, sirup of Citron pils, and Oxysac∣chara, of each halfe an ounce, water of Balme and of Buglosse, of each one ounce, Cicorie water
one ounce and a halfe, temper them all together to a potion. And it were not ill that he take euery fourth day one of these pils following: Take Aloe one quarter of an ounce, Rubarb one dragme, Agatick foure scruples, red and white Behen, Saffron, Mace, and Indy Salt, of each three graines, make pils thereof with the iuice of Buglosse, sixe to a dragme. If there be greater heate approching, then is it aduised, that at the first euery day be taken halfe a dragme of Trocis∣cos de Camphora, with sirupe of Pomgranats dissolued, and so continue foure dayes together. And if this will not help, then must the patient drinke new Buttermilke, with all these pur∣gations and letting blood. It is also highly commended, to carie a sober life in eating and drin∣king, yet to take héede that the patient remaine by his strength. We will héere mention some moe things that are very commodious for the panting of the hart, like as fragrant things which are of a cold nature, as Violets, water Lillies, Roses, all Saunders, Corrall, Perle, Campher, Harts bones, Iacints, Smaragdes, shauen Iuorie, Am∣ber, Coriander, the iuice of Limons, Rose water, odoriferous fruites, Quinces, Peares, Apples, and their like. Amongst compounds are the confection of Orange pils and their sirupe, the con∣fection of Citrons, and their sirupes, conserue of Buglosse, Roses, Violets, Burrage, confected Cherries, and their sirupes, the flowres and rootes of Cicorie confected, sirupe of Sorrell, Burrage wine, and Cherie wine, the Tabulats of Diamargariton, Diarrhodon Abbatis, Draga∣gant, and Manus Christi with perles: but the Phisitions do ordaine many compounded medi∣cines, as hereafter do follow. The laxatiue sirup of Roses is specially commended, if there be any stopping of the belly, for it cooleth and diuerteth all ill vapors from the hart, whereby the hart is much pained. There are also made for this many confections, according to the importance of the patient, whereof there follow some hereafter: Take conserue of Roses halfe an ounce, conserue of Bu∣glosse two ounces, conserue of water Lillies one quarter of an ounce, Perles, Iacints, Sma∣ragdes, Citron séede, Sorrell séede, and red Corrall, of each one dragme, red, white, and yellow Saunders, prepared Coriander, burnt Iuorie, red and white Behen, Harts bones stéeped in Rose water, of each halfe a dragme, filed Gold and Siluer, of each two scruples, Gold and Sil∣uer leaues, of each xv. Sugar one ounce and a halfe: beate them all small together, and temper it with Rose water, but not on the fire. Item, take the iuice of sweete Apples, and of Buglosse which is cleare and setled, of each two ounces, Doronicum, Citron pils, Burrage floures, Roses, shauen Iuorie, of each halfe an ounce, Basill séedes halfe an ounce, Mirtle leaues, Balme, Coriander, Cinnamome, Galingall, Sedu∣ary, Spike, Lignum Aloes, burnt silke, and Saffron, of each one quarter of an ounce, small filed Gold and Siluer, of each two dragmes and a halfe, red and white Behen, burnt Harts horne, Mace, Galliae Muscatae, Amber, Harts bones, red Saunders, of each thrée dragmes, of all Miro∣balans, of each halfe an ounce, Smaragdes, Berill, Iacincts, Saphires, Granates, which be prepared, of each one dragme, Perles thrée dragmes, Amber and Campher, of each halfe a scruple, Muske one dragme, make a powder thereof, and to euery ounce of powder put twelue ounces of Sugar: dissolue the Sugar in Rose water, and séethe it for to make Tabulates thereof, or a confection. This confection is of a temperate nature, very forcible for all swouning, and maladies of the hart. These two next following are cooling. Take conserue of Roses, Buglosse, Burrage, of each one ounce, Species de Gemmis, and Ru∣bies, of each one scruple, Harts bones, & péeled Citron seede, of each 10. graines, sirup of Apples as much as you desire to make it soft, vse thereof in the morning two howres before meate. The other: Take conserues of Roses two ounces, conserues of Buglosse one ounce, Species Triasandalon, burnt Iuorie, Sorrell séedes, peeled Melon seede, Gourd séede, and péeled Cucum∣ber séede, Limon seede, and Oxysacchara, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Sugar halfe an ounce, Perles two scruples, thrée leaues of beaten Gold, mixe it with the sirupe of Apples vnto a confection. And if this panting of the hart come too often, then giue of this powder following halfe a dragme tempered with Rose water, and water of Buglosse. Take red Corrall, Iacinct, Smaragdes, and Saphir, of each fiue graines, small filed Gold thrée graines, Perles halfe a drag. temper them together, and put thereto a spoonefull of white Vineger, & make a potion thereof. Item, take red Corrall, Perles, Iacincts, and Smaragdes, all together prepared, of each one scrup. & giue therof half a drag. with some kind of distilled water.
Restoratiue waters of Capons are very requisite for this, which must be thus prepared: Boyle the Capon in water, wherein hath diuers times gold béene quenched, chop it after∣wards in peeces, and put thereto flowers of Borage, Buglosse, Violets, Roses, Citron péeles, Cinnamome, Cloues, Balme and Saffron, of each one dragme. If you cannot get all these, then take as many of them as you can get, and distill them all togither with flesh and broth in hot water: and then when any body is very feeble, giue him a meetely draught thereof; it strengtheneth not only the Hart, but the stomacke also maruellous much. There is also another made with spices, as followeth: When the Capon is made cleane, then stampe him with bones and flesh in a mortar, afterwards powre it into a glasse helme, Borage, Balme, Endiue, Fennell, and Rose water, of each two ounces; then put thereto the stampt Capon. Item, put more thereto the water of Wormwood and of Comfery, of each one ounce, Spec. de gemmis, Diarrhodon Abbatis, Diamargariton the cold, Cinnamome, Lignum Aloes, of each one scrup. distill them all togither as before. Moreouer, there is another Capon water to be distilled, as followeth: Take an old Capon that is made cleane, put thereto fower quarts of water, let them seethe well togither, then pull off the skin, and the fatnes, and then breake him all to péeces, and distill water thereof as be∣fore. You are to salt this water, so that it may last the better without stinking. You haue also here before in the fift Chapter in the 22. §. a precious water, which strengtheneth the Hart woonderfull much, the which may be also vsed for the same. Sirupe of Apples.We haue often here before admonished of the sirupe of Apples, which is thus made: Take the iuice of sweete and sower Apples, of each fiue ounces, seethe it to the halfe, scumming it, then let it stand two daies to settle; put thereto thrée ounces of Sugar, and then séethe them togi∣ther vnto a sirupe. Another: Take the iuice of the best tasting swéete and sower Apples, of each twelue ounces, séethe it vntill it be well scummed, then put thereto sixe ounces of Sugar, and let it séethe togither to a sirupe. These sirupes strengthen the weake panting Hart, preserue one from swouning, and strengthen the stomacke. Item, take Rose water, the iuice of sower Apples, and water of Buglosse, of each thrée oun∣ces, seethe these togither to a sirupe, or to a Iulep. For this is also good many kindes of accustomed sirupes, as the sirupe of vineger, and of Li∣mons, of Raspes, Violets, water Lillies, veriuice, Sorrell, Borage and Buglosse, also Iulep of Violets and Roses: the which are to be found in the first Register by their names.

If you will make Sugar plates thereof, then séethe it with Rose water, as hath béene taught. The like confection or powder may be made also of the Species De gemmis, or any other that like you best. And alwaies for one ounce of Species, you must take 12. ounces of Sugar. Of such things as are to be applied outwardly for it. FOr this are highly commended the cordiall waters, and to that ende we will expresse ma∣ny: Take water of Buglosse sixe ounces, water of Cicorie twelue ounces, water of Balme fower ounces, Species de gemmis the cold, Laetificantes Almansoris, of each one scrup. Species Triasantali one drag. and a halfe, white vineger halfe an ounce, and Malmsey two ounces; let it séethe a little, and then make a scarlet cloth wet in it a quarter of a yard square, wring it out, and lay the same on his left breast fower or fiue times, before and after meate, and twice a∣gaine before he go to bed.

The same vertue that these shields haue is also in the Plaisters, for which these following are highly commended, as well to coole the panting of the hart, as the pulse, and therewith for to strengthen the breath, hart, and all naturall powers. Take Doronicum, Harts bones, red and white Behen, of each one dragme and a halfe, red and white Saunders, burnt Iuorie, leaues of wild Grapes, red and white Corall, of each one quarter of an ounce, Roses thrée dragmes, wa∣ter of Buglosse and Barly meale, one ounce and a halfe, Saffron two scruples and sixe graines, foure ounces of Malmsey, oyle of Saffron halfe an ounce, molten Rosin halfe an ounce, and make a plaister thereof.

For these sicke persons it is also very commodious (like as is already expressed) to hold at their noses continually odoriferous things that are cold of nature. For which be vsed the Po∣manders which are described in the sixt Part, or these following: Take Basill, Roses, Vio∣lets, burnt Iuorie, and Harts bones, of each two dragmes, Camfere two scruples, Muske and Amber of each fower graines, red and white Saunders, red and white Corall, of each one drag. beate each alone, and being tempered, binde them all together in a red peece of silke, and smell thereon continually. These simples also are very commodious, especially if there be an Ague with it, as Violets, Roses, Saunders, water Lillies, Rose water, Vineger, and such like, as hath before béene shewed. Clisters to comfort the Hart.It is very profitable also for the patient euery morning to vse these Clisters following: for it doth not onely loose the body, but also strengthen the Hart. Take Mallowes, Violet leaues, Linséede, and Fenegréeke, of each one handfull and a halfe, séethe them in broth wherein hath béen sodden a Lambes head, then take twelue ounces of this decoction, oile of Violets and swéete Almonds of each one ounce, the marrow of Calues bones, Duckes grease, Hens grease and swéete Butter, of each thrée dragmes, Tho.

In like maner may this salue be cōtinually vsed: Take oyle of swéete Almonds, Ducks grease and swéete butter, of each one ounce, the iuice of Mer∣cury fower ounces; séethe these togither till the iuice be throughly sodden away: with this oyntment annoynt from the Nauell downewards vnto the Hips, in the euening when you go to bed. This Clister may be vsed both in cold and hot causes of the panting of the Hart. Now as concerning the order of life, especiall care must be aken that he be not ouerchar∣ged with eating and drinking. In the beginning of this sickenes, Barly paps are very commo∣dious: Also Hens or Pullets drest with Vineger or Veriuice. In fine, he ought not to order himselfe in this sicknes, then according to the custome of other hot diseases. It is very good to séethe or stéepe in his drinke Burrage or Buglosse with the flowers. He must refraine from all clowdie cold and moyst ayre, his bed and his chamber shall he hang and strewe with Willow leaues, Roses, water Lillies, and Vine leaues, and that principally when it is hot weather. Also he must beware of all windy and flatulent meates; as Milke, Pottage, Honie, fruit, and especially grosse slimy meates, as those made of dough, grosse fish, vnleauened bread, old Chéese, Chestnuts, and such like. In like manner also from all sharpe and heady things, as Onions, Garlicke, Radishes, Léekes, and such like. All grosse wines are naught for him, and water also decocted with Licorice. Of the panting of the Hart through cold. §. 5. WHen as there is no Ague with the panting of the hart, then is it a signe that the same procéedeth of cold which is caused for the most part of a watery Phlegma, whereby the breath is hindered, yea sometimes is stuffed with such force in the breast, that it séemeth that they will stifle. This hath also a slow inconstant Pulse, with an heauy breath, and sluggishnes of the whole body and mind, and with an ill fauoured colour of the face. This is to be remedied as hereafter fol∣loweth: Take water of Baulme, water of blew Flower deluce, and Agrimony, of each one ounce and a halfe, and a little Sugar; and then drinke it fower or eight mornings togither very warme. But if the patient cannot goe to stoole, then is this Purgation following to be giuen him: Take Electuarij Indi one ounce, De Succo Rosarum halfe a dragme, temper this with thrée ounces of good wine, and giue it him in the morning betimes. And if the body be bound at the time when the foresaid drinke is to be vsed, then must the patient take alwaies one hower or twaine before supper, one or two of these pils following: Take Pillulae de Sarcocolla one dragme,
Alephanginae one quarter of an ounce, make thereof fower and twenty pils with the iuice of Roses. Also he must drinke this euery morning: Take Treacle or Mithridate one drag. or one and a halfe, according as you thinke best, and temper this with good wine. Some do aduise, that at the first, yea forthwith you do giue with wine one dragme, or a dragme and a halfe of these Tabulates following: Take Masticke, Indy Spike, Lignum Aloes, Cinnamome, Cloues, Cardamome, and Citron pils, of each one drag. and a halfe, Muske halfe a scruple: make a powder thereof, and giue it him as aforesaid. But the principall things seruing to this panting of the hart, we will briefly expresse, to wit, all that is warme of nature and smelleth swéete; as Amber, Muske, Saffron, Lignum Aloes, red Styrax, Cloues, Citron pils, Nuts, Cinnamom, Marierom gentle, Basill, Spike of Indie, Baulme, Burrage, red and white Behen, Doronicum, Zeduary, Cardamome, Rosemary, and Basill séede. Of all these things are made confections, powders, & other compositions, as shall appeare hereafter. Of compounds these are commonly made at the Apothecaries, as Diambra, Dianthon, Diathamaron, Laetificans de Gemmis calidis, Aromaticum Rosatum, de Xylo Aloes, Dia∣pliris, and confected Citron pils. Here followe certaine Electuaries for to vse inwardly. Take Masticke, Cinnamom, both kinds of Basill, Mints, Marierom gentle, and long Pepper, of each a like much: when you haue ten dragmes of this powder, then mixe therewith prepared Pearles, red Corall, Amber, burnt silke, red and white Behen, and Indy Spike, of each halfe a dragme: afterwards min∣gle it with Honie vnto an Electuary wherein Mirobalans Chebuli be put. This is good not onely for the panting of the hart, swouning, and for faintnes of the hart; but also for a cold and féeble stomacke, for it strengtheneth the same excéedingly. This must also be noted,Nota. when any confection is to be made wherein there is no certaine quantitie of Honie, then are you to take alwaies for one ounce of powder thrée ounces of Honie, and then mingle them well togither. Item, take the flowers of Burrage, Buglosse, Rosemarie, red and white Behen, Saffron, Doronicum, Lignum Aloes, Licorice and Basill séede, of each one quarter of an ounce, Iacint, Smaragde, and Saphire, of each halfe a scruple, Sugar thrice as much as the other; make a powder thereof: whereof the patient is to take a scruple at the least at meale tides. Conserues of yellow Violets are very much vsed, and also highly commended for this pan∣ting of the hart. You haue also before in the first Part the twelfth Chapter a good stomachicall powder, in the first §. which serueth for this purpose. Item, there is in the 5. §. a water of Lil∣lies of Conuallies. Also in the eight part many sundry waters of life, hot of nature, which are for this very commodious. Confected Nutmegs do strengthen all inward members, and con∣sume all superfluous humors. Conserue of Buglosse, Burrage, Marierom gentle, Rosemarie, Cowslips, & Cicorie mingled with other, or each of it selfe, do much strengthen the hart. In like manner are good for this all Pomanders which are hot of nature, and are to be sought for in the Register, and those are spe∣ciall good, wherein Muske and Amber are put. Item, steepe the space of certaine howres Baulme in Malmesey, and besprinkle therewith a hot brickbat, and then receiue the vapor into the nose. There may also be laid outwardly cordiall waters vpon the left breast, which are thus to be prepared: Take Baulme water, & Buglosse water, of each sixe ounces, Vineger one ounce, Cloues one dragme, Saffron halfe a dragme, Muske halfe a scruple; lay it with a cloth vpon the left breast. Some do vse the iuice of the herbes (when they be setled) in stéede of their wa∣ters, which are also very forcible. Item, take Buglosse water, and the water of Sorrell, of each thrée ounces, water of Willow leaues, Rose water, and Wormewood water, the water of Grasse and of Baulme, of each two ounces, Spec. cordiales temperatas one dragme and a halfe, Saffron eight graines, Myrrhe, Diptamus, Gentian, Lignum Aloes, yellow Saunders, Basill séeds, red and white Behen, Iacint and Smaragde, of each halfe a scruple, the iuice of Limons thrée ounces, Vineger one ounce, and Malmesey thrée ounces, temper them all togither; it is wholly temperate: so that it may be vsed for the comforting of the Hart in cold and heate.
Another. TAke fresh Rosemary floures thrée ounces, Sage floures, Buglosse floures, Burrage floures, of each one ounce and a halfe, Saffron one scruple, séethe the floures in sufficient Muscadell, and then stamp them well together, and lay it warme vpon the left brest, this doth not only strengthen, but maketh also a light breathing. There may also shields be made for this, euen as héere do follow two sorts: Take floures of Burrage and Buglosse, of each one handfull, red and white Behen, and Saffron, of each one dragme, burnt red silke one scruple, Cloues, Cinnamome, red Corrall, and Roses, of each halfe a dragme, Harts bones, Muske and Amber, of each thrée graines: put all these in a red silke bag, then must you besprinckle them with warme Buglosse water, and so lay them to the left breast. Item, take Zeduary, red and white Behen, Rosemary, Indy Spica, Roses, red and white Saunders, Burrage floures, burnt Iuorie, Mirtle leaues, Buglosse floures, and Cam∣fer of each two scruples, Saffron and Gallia Muscata, of each one dragme, Ambra halfe a scruple, Muske foure graines, and make a bag thereof. This is very temperate. There are also these plaisters and salues, that hereafter follow to be vsed: Take Laudanum thrée ounces, Cloues & Citron pils, of each one dragme, Muske one scruple, Turpentine halfe a dragme, melt then the Laudanum with the Turpentine in a warme morter, temper the rest amongst it, and so make a plaister thereof, spread it on a red clout, and so lay it on the left brest. For to make a salue or oyntment, take vnripe oyle of Oliues, and oyle of Roses, of each two ounces, Sandaraca one dragme and a halfe, parched Salt thrée dragmes, Roses and Cypers rootes, of each halfe a dragme: beate them all small together, and kéepe and preserue it vntill occasion serue to vse it. For it hapneth oftentimes, that such humors do draw downewards, and fall in some place of the hip, the knee, or ancle, the which must be kept warme. Lastly, you ought not to rest, vntill the patient be frée of this panting of the hart, without vsing any medicine vnto it, or that the disease may with all diligence be diminished, if the same could be perfectly cured. Therefore must alwayes a little Saffron be mixt amongst all his meates, and if that cannot be gotten, then is the dry powder to be drest amongst his meate. All these confections may be made thus: Take the Spec. Laetificantes Almansoris, Dia Mosch dulcis, De gemmis temperatis, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, red and white Saunders, red and white Corrall, of each one dragme, Sirupe of Citrons, sirupe of Roses, and of Vineger, of each fiue ounces, white Sugar thrée ounces, séethe the sirupe and the Sugar vntill it be thicker than Hony, and when it doth begin to be cold, then mixe the powder amongst it, and vse thereof in the morning, and two howres before supper, about the bignes of a Walnut. Thirdly, make two bags in this manner: Take Basill séeds, floures of Buglosse, of Bur∣rage, Marierom, red and white Corrall, red and white Saunders, of each halfe a dragme, Iacint, Smaragdes and Saphir, of each fiue graines, Campher one scruple, wilde Vine leaues one quarter of an ounce, Mace one dragme and a halfe, stamp them all small, and fill herewith (as is sayd) a little bag, and lay it on the hart. The rule of life for this sicknes consisteth in light meates, as in all field Foules, in meates that be drest with odoriferous spices, yolks of new layd egs are very méete for him: further, behold what is taught in the discourse of the cold braines, and cold head. For his drinke, white Wine soberly drunken is good. For Wine, be it as strong as may be, if one drinke too much thereof, then doth it cause cold diseases: and if one desire to delay it, then is it to be done with water, wherein glowing Gold hath béen extinguished. This Wine following doth strengthen the hart and the stomacke also: Take Ginger two ounces, Galingall one ounce, Cinnamome two ounces, Zeduary one quarter of an ounce, Ro∣ses one ounce, Burrage floures one ounce and a halfe, and rootes of Buglosse, beate them togi∣ther grosly; and steepe them in eight quarts of Must or new Wine. These spiced Wines are also good for the hart, if the disease do come through cold: in like manner Wine of Burrage, of Harts toong, of Rosemary, of Buglosse, and of Hyssop, of Marie∣rom, and of Asarabacca, all which haue power to warme the panting of the hart, and also to strengthen it. Item, take Balme water, and Buglosse water, of each sixe ounces, Sugar nine ounces,
séethe them to twelue ounces, and then vse it as a Iulep. Or take water of Buglosse alone, wherein Cloues were sodden, and drinke sometimes thereof, for it comforteth maruellously. Item, take Parsly with the roote, boyle them in Wine, according to that you will haue it strong: temper therewith a little Vineger, and drinke the same. It taketh away the panting of the hart, and all paine of the same. Besides all this, the patient is to forbeare all milkie, doughy, moyst, and windie meates, to arise from meales with hunger, and halfe a thirst: he must after meate not moue nor stirre much, nor yet sodainly giue himselfe to sléepe: he must also (according to his old wont) not sléepe too much, whereby he might consume and diminish the humidities of the bodie: he must also for the most part lye on his right side, and flie all anger, sorrow, and all other vexations. Of the panting of the Hart through a bad stomacke or Appetite. §. 6. HEre before amongst the signes of this sicknes, we haue taught also that the pan∣ting of the hart, and the swouning, are caused oftentimes through a bad stomack. But if this disease come of a full stomack, then must the cure begin with refrai∣ning from meate and drinke, and first with opening the Liuer veine, afterwards the Median. But if this be not very néedfull, then are you to minister to the pati∣ent a milde Clister, for that all strong purgations are enemies to this disease. Further, he must obserue for his meate and drinke, euen as is shewed hereafter, in the descrip∣tion of the stomacke. Now for to strengthen the stomacke through outward things, choose for it out of the foresayd remedies that which best liketh you. Of the panting of the Hart through frighting. §. 7. IT is also admonished in the beginning, that ye Hart may come to much distem∣perature through fright and feare, and that through the concourse of bloud, for which, this water of Elderne floures is maruellous good. Lay then into a glased helme chopt Elderne floures: afterwards lay thereon whole Egs with the piked end vpwards, and the same opened alittle: then againe Elderne floures, and so Egs, vntill that the helme be so full as the water is high, wherein the helme standeth, and is to be distilled. When it is thus distilled, then are you to lay of this El∣derne water with a cloth vpon the hart, thus do the auncient Phisitions accustome to make it. But marke that not only feare and fright do disease the hart, but also all other motions of the minde, which are herebefore for the most part alreadie expressed: but what power they haue in furthering the sicknes and health, is sufficiently before discouered in both the descriptions of vnnaturall things, which the learned do call Res non naturales, in the first Chapter and 10. §. Of Heauines, a disease of the Hart. §. 8. THe cause of this infirmitie is Melancholia, where are sorrow, feare, and many won∣derfull fantasies without any cause at all, which are thus to be purged: Take Miro∣balani, Chebuli, and Indi, of each one dragme, Epithimi one dragme and a halfe, fine Bolus fiue graines, Muscus thrée graines, make pils thereof, or mingle them with Wine: but this following is more common: Take Senie leaues one ounce, beate them, and cast them in the iuice of Burrage and of Buglosse, of each sixe ounces, the iuice of Apples thrée ounces: let it séethe alittle, and wring it out, and then mingle therewith sixe ounces of fine Su∣gar: then let it séethe againe, and when it is cold, temper amongst it one dragme of Saffron, and vse thereof as often as you please, at each time one ounce, in Wine, or tempered in one of the foresayd waters. You haue also in the 5. §. before a very good confection, which beginneth thus: Take Ma∣stick, Cinnamome, &c. which may also be vsed for this passion. This following is also very expert: Take rootes of Buglosse halfe an ounce, Zeduary, and Doronicum, of each one quarter of an ounce, beate them to powder, and giue euery day thereof one dragme with Wine. Behold also what hath béen sayd before in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, and 8. §. of the madnes, Melancholia, and also in like manner in the third part, which are commodious for this.
Of the griping of the Hart. §. 9. HEre before in the end of the fift Chapter we haue rehersed, that this sicknes which we do call the griping of the hart, is rather a disease of the Lights, or a kind of consumpti∣on, than a maladie of the hart: but be it taken as it will, yet neuertheles is this sicknes very grieuous for young children, and almost incurable for old folks. And in fine, this english name doth signifie none other, than the Feuer Hectica, whereof we shall further discourse in the sixt part (where we do write of all Agues) for we haue alwayes thought good to adde thereto this that followeth: Take Walnuts with the shels, burne them wholie to ashes in a pot, and thereof giue a child one scruple, or more, according vnto the strength of the child. Item, take dry browne Betonie, & therewith fill a small bag, and lay it on the childs brest. Women are of opinion, that if the child may liue till the ninth day, then will it recouer health. For this you haue also a speciall Capon water for children that haue the consumption, in the fift Chapter, the 22. §. It is also sufficiently knowen to all the world, how that the hart by pestilent ayre, will not only be féebled and infected, but also inflamed with a full destruction, against which you shall find sundry fit remedies in the sixt part, in the treatise of the Plague. For conclusion of this Chapter of the Hart, and of the second part of this booke, we will not omit the description of the Species de gemmis, whereof is so often mention made, which are to be found at euery good Apothecaries after two kinds of preparations, to wit, the cold, and the hote Species, which may be vsed to Confections, Powders, Cordiall waters, and such like, but by reason that the preparation of the same is very diuers, therefore we will héere set foorth and de∣scribe only foure sorts of the most common preparations. Species de gemmis frig.Spec. de gemmis frigidae which are cold of nature, are thus prepared: Take Perles 3. drag. Rubies, Iacints, Granadoes, Smaragdes, and Saphirs, of each one drag. Harts bones halfe a drag. burnt Iuorie, red and white Corrall, of each one drag. Roses one drag. and a halfe, white and yellow Saunders, floures of Buglosse, Burrage, Sorrell séede, and Basill séede, red & white Behen, of each one dragme, beaten Gold and Siluer, of each fiue leaues. Species de gemmis ca∣lidae.Species de gemmis calidae or Mesuae: Take prepared Perles thrée drag. Saphirs, Iacints, Sar∣donix, Correils, Granadoes and Smaragdes, of each one drag. and a halfe, Zeduary, Doroni∣cum, Citron pils, Mace, and Basill séede, of each one quarter of an ounce, red Corrall, Amber, and filed Iuorie, of each halfe a scruple, red and white Behen, Cloues, Ginger, long Pepper, Spica, Cassy wood, Saffron, and Cardamome, of each one drag. Cinnamome, Galingall, & Ze∣duary, of each one drag. and a half, small filed Gold and Siluer, of each two scruples, Amber  quarter of an ounce, Muske halfe a drag. each beaten by it selfe, and then tempered together. Species de gemmis tem∣peratae.Species de gemmis temperatae. These species are of a temperate nature, not too hote, also not too cold, the which may be prepared as is thought good. Species Cordiales, Cordiall species. For this, take Perles, burnt Iuorie, Granadoes, Cinna∣mome, Tormentill, and fine Bolus, of each thrée drag. red, white, and yellow Saunders, shauen Iuorie, and Vnicornes horne, of each one quarter of an ounce, Iacints, Saphirs, white and red Corrall, Valerian, Diptamus, Zeduary, and Lignum Aloes, of each one drag. sealed earth fiue scruples, burnt silke two scruples, Harts bones halfe a drag. red and white Behen, of each two scruples, fiue leaues of beaten Gold, Muske and Amber, of each ten graines, either of them prepared after his manner, are to be beaten together. Species Dia margariton frigidae.The same operation haue also almost the Species Dia margariton, whereof there are 2. kinds hote & cold; the warme are here before described in the 12. Chapter 12. §. the cold are thus pre∣pared: take péeled Melon séeds, Pompeon séeds, Gourd séeds, and péeled Cucumber séeds, Pur∣slane séeds, white Poppie séeds, white, yellow, and red Saunders, Ginger, Roses, water Lil∣lies, Burrage floures, and Mirtle seeds, of each one drag. white and red Corrall, of each halfe a drag. Perles thrée drag. prepared together and being all beaten small, temper them all toge∣ther. This holdeth all fell people that fall quickly into a swoune, in their strength, whether it be caused of the stomack, or of the hart; it fortifieth all the inward vitall parts: it is also good against all Coughes, against the consumption; and all those that be brought lowe through a long sicknes, it bringeth againe to their former might and strength.
The third part of this Booke of Phisicke, Containeth the Bellie. THe third part of mans body, haue the Anatomists (who are the sur∣ueiors of the vniformity and members of mans body) ascribed to the belly, which beginneth outwardly from the breast, and inwardly from the Diaphragma, descending downewards euen to the legs. This part hath outwardly these members following: on the forepart the Nauel, which is placed in the midst of the whole body and belly; vnder which do follow both the parts of generation, the which in man are the testi∣cles or stones hanging downe in a cod: behind are the raines and the buttockes which couer the fundament. The inward members are the stomack, the liuer, the gall, the kidneys, the bladder, the bowels, and in women the mother: all which are subiect to very dangerous diseases; of the which we are now to write and dicourse. The first Chapter. Of the Nauell. THe first outward member of the bellly is the Nauell, which is called the roote of the belly, for that nature hath formed it as the first amongst the féeding parts, and also in new borne children holdeth fast in the mothers belly, no otherwise then as it were a roote in the earth. For like as the root of a trée draweth nourishment vnto it whereby it groweth: euen so doth the nauell also, which draweth the blood vnto it out of the mothers body thereby to nourish the child, and make it grow. Euen as the foresaid roote of a trée, of all that which it draweth vnto it for food, doth not driue away any thing but all that which is watery and vnnecessary for his nourishment (as the gum which one séeth on a trée): euen so doth the string of the nauell, which sweateth out all superfluous moisture which is not good for nourishment, and doth gather all the same together in the Secun∣dina vntill the birth day, the which is called of women the flood, or breaking of the water. All people be they yong or old may get a rupture of the nauell, which swelleth and hangeth out of the forepart of the belly; the which causeth chiefly to women a great hinderance if they be not holpen thereof, like as we shall write hereafter more at large when we shall discourse of the rupture: yet we will here discourse and write somewhat of certaine things for the behoofe and ease of yong children. Take Comfrey one ounce, stampe it well, put thereto halfe an ounce of molten Waxe, tem∣per it well, and then lay it vpon the nauell. But if the rupture be very great, then take Beares grease, and therewith annoint the whole back bone of the child; it causeth the Nauell to be drawne in. It is found to be oftentimes good for all ruptures of the Nauell, be it in people of discretion, or in yoong children, that the herbe Perfoliata and his séed be sodden and layd vpon the rupture, and so worne, or caried continually vpon the nauell, vntill that thereby the rupture be cured. And the same séed being also sodden in water or in wine, and one drag. thereof giuen to drink, or stamp the herbe and the seed, and giue thereof to the child the weight of one scruple and a half to eate in pap. Also you shall hereafter find a plaister of Perfoliata which you may vse for this purpose. A good powder. Take Lupins meale halfe an ounce, burnt linnen one quarter of an ounce, temper them together, and take therof one quarter of an ounce: then temper it afterwards with wine, and lay it vpon the nauell.
Satyros. Some do write, that when a man without lust of women hath his yard erected, and comming to a woman the same will not swage nor relent, that then it is called Priapismus, Saty∣rismus is the erection of the priuities, which is lost by copulation. The cause of both these infir∣mities, are grosse thick vapors or dampes, with smal heate that they cannot suddenly spend, as also abstinence from women, continuall vse of Pease and Beanes, and other pottages. In fine, if there be not speedy remedy for these causes, then may insue after it as great a paine and di∣stention of the sinewes, as at the last might cause an intollerable crampe and impostume. For to remedy this infirmity, foure things are to be noted: first, that the patient beware of all such things which might cause the yard to stand, and stirre vp venery: what these are, we will shew immediatly hereafter. Secondly, he must indeuour to vomit, to let blood, and to take mild purgations. Thirdly, to rub well the vppermost members, and not the vndermost, to hin∣der the defluxe of the matter. Fourthly, the patient must refraine womens company, except it be that he haue very great lust thereto. And for to cure this, it is therefore aduised that first the Median be opened, and afterwards cause the patient to vomit. If it will not thereby amend, o∣pen the veine againe, and giue the patient a little of the muscilage of Fleawoort, which is made with the water of Purslaine or of water lillies, or bathe the members and parts about it with boyled Rue, Agnus castus. Cumin, and such like. Item, annoint the kidneyes and the priuities with herbes cold of nature, of which the séeds of Fleawort, Campher and Poplar salue are tem∣pered. For his Sallad he must take Purslaine, Endiue, lettice, and such like. For vineger, the iuice of Limons and Citrons are good in all his meates. To fast much, and liue onely by water and bread is very good for him: but in case he will drinke wine, then must it be well watered. This plaister following shall he weare on the reines and the priuities, so long as this sicknesse endureth: Take white waxe sixe ounces, melt it, and wash it ten times in cold water: afterwards temper amongst it halfe an ounce of small bruised Campher, or weare vpon the raines a thin plate of lead full of holes, and wet it often with vineger and Campher. This powder following may also be prepared: Take Fleawort two dragmes and a halfe, Purslaine seed, prepared Co∣riander, and Lettice séed, of each one quarter of an ounce, Campher one dragme, temper them all together being powdred small, and giue euery morning one dragme thereof with the sirupe of Limons, or faire water. Vnder the patients shéets must be laid the leaues of Agnus castus, and he must lie alwayes vpon his side. But if he cannot abide to fast, then is he to eate much bread of Millet, and many Sallads, and his drinke shall be white Wine, wherein Rue, Cumin, Cori∣ander, and such like haue bene stéeped. Also cold sirupes, cold confections, and such like, are very commodious for him. The sent of Beuercod, of Campher, of Saunders, Roses, and all cooling things are also passing good for him. The third Chapter. Of the Testicles and Cods, and of sundry Ruptures. NAture hath fastened behind the yard or secresie a wrinkled bag or purse, wherein the testicles or stones are kept. This member is subiect to many Hernies or Ruptures, the which the Latinists do call with one common name Herniam: which notwithstanding is manifold, and yet comprehen∣ded in thrée of the principallest, which are caused of swelling, of scabbines, or of striuing, all which do fall downe into the said Cods. Yet is there another kind of rupture which commeth about the Nauel, or about the priuities, be it in man or woman, whereof we haue made some mention before in the first Chapter. The first sort of ruptures hath many differences, and each hath his proper name, and are to be compared with each other in foure kind of wayes, to wit, when they are caused through wind: through puffing vp of the veines with the bloud, Varices: when the bowels or rim of the same little or much falleth downe into the cod: lastly, when as the cod is so filled with water or other moistures. Other do ret foure kinds moe, which neuerthelesse may be contained amongst the foresaid foure. The causes of all these mixtures are either inward or outward. The outward causes may be fals, thrus much labour, heauy burthens, lowd hooping, coughes, extreme blowing or winding, and chiefly
when one hath well eaten and drunken. The inward causes are, when his bowels or rim can∣not stay in his due place, but commeth to fall downe into the nauell, priuities, and into the cod. Likewise winds, humors, or grosse melancholicke blood, like as is said. The signes of all com∣mon ruptures, are an extuberation or swelling, and puffing vp of the same place beyond nature. These Hernies appeere at the first like to a small egge or nut, which by little and little increa∣seth. If this rupture procéed of wind, that may be heard by the shréeking or rumblng, and it may be discerned with the eyes. Of the vppermost Hernies or Rupture, which happeneth aboue the Cod. §. 1. FIrst, to speake of the rupture which hapneth aboue the cod, (which is called Scro∣tum) it is aduised that forthwith remedy be had for it. The new ruptures in chil∣dren, are easily to be holpen; & contrariwise when they waxe old (especially in old folks) then are they hard to be holpen without incision. All Chirurgions do know well, what kind of trusse they are to make for this: forasmuch as it is difficult to describe the same, therefore be they to be put in trust therewith. It is commaunded, and not without reason, that the patient must be layd on his backe, and that the bowels which are fallen downe must be put vp softly againe, vntill that they do lie in their due place: then must this plaister (spred vpon a thin péece of leather) be layd vpon the rup∣ture, and on the top thereof a bolster bounden prety and hard. They that be about thirteene yéeres old, must lie on their back; and if they must néeds arise, then must they beware of stouping, and hold stil their hand vpon the rupture. But yong children must be dealt with somewhat mil∣der. But for this can no certaine rule be prescribed: but regard must alwayes be had to the age, to the strength, the time and disease, and so to deale thereafter. Now for to help these ruptures, we wil decipher first certaine plaisters which are very fit and requisite for it: Take Pitch and Mastick, of each thrée dragmes, Frankinsence one quarter of an ounce, Hypocistis, Sarcocolla,Plaisters for the rupture. and the iuice of Sloes, of each one dragme and a halfe, bloodstone, Dragon blood and Aloe, of each two dragmes and a halfe, birdlime one dragme and a halfe, Comfrey, Gals, Pomegranat péels, fine Bolus, of each thrée dragmes, Aristology one quarter of an ounce, Sumach, blossomes of Pomegranates, of each one dragme, two ounces of Déere suet, Turpentine and Waxe as much as is needfull. The gums and iuices dissolue in hot vineger or wine: the rest powne small, and make thereof a plaister. Another: Take pitch halfe an ounce, white and red Waxe, Litharge of gol, Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Momy, of each two dragmes and a halfe, birdlime, Myrrhe, Ci∣pers nuts and Frankinsence, of each one dragme, Gips or plaister, prepared Bolus and Aloe, of each halfe an ounce, Mastick, Comfrey and Daisie roots, of each thrée dragmes and a halfe, Tur∣pentine one ounce, Aristology round and long, and Galnuts, of each one ounce, Dragon bloud one quarter of an ounce, but melt the Gums in vineger, and powne all that is to be powned: the Pitch, Waxe and Turpentine are to be molten, and the rest tempered amongst them: the Waxe may be augmented and diminished according to the importance of the time. This plaister is also good for all fractures of bones. The auncient Phisitions were wont to vse for this rupture, this plaister following: Take Cipers nuts two ounces, Myrrhe, Cipers rootes, Marioram gentle, Gals, the iuice of Sloes, Frankinsence and Gum, of each one ounce: the Gum is to be dissolued in wine, and the rest tem∣pered amongst it, and so (as it is said) layd vpon the rupture. You shall not vnloose the trusse but once in foure or fiue dayes, and then renew the plaister. Item take fish lime two ounces, Momy one ounce and a halfe, pitch and Ammoniacum, of each one ounce, breake them all to péeres, and lay it to stéepe one day and a night in thrée ounces of vineger and oile of Mastick: afterwards let them melt together, and temper therewith Ma∣stick, Frankinsence, fine Bolus, Dragon bloud, Gum, and Fenegréeke meale, of each thrée drag. and stir it long together. Item take Daisie flowers and rootes, wild Tansie flowers and rootes, Comfrey, of each halfe an ounce, Masticke one quarter of an ounce, the iuice of Sloes and Pomegranate flowers, of each half a dragme, Hares haire chopt small one dragme, birdlime one ounce, pitch two oun∣ces, Waxe fiue dragmes, oyle of Roses as much as is néedfull, to make therewith a plaister.
This salue following is much in vse: Take Pitch thrée ounces, red Waxe, Butumen Iudaicum, Ammoniacum, Galbanum and Turpentine, of each two ounces, Litharge of gold one ounce, Hen∣bane séed, Aloe and Mastick, of each thrée ounces, Gips or plaister, and fine Bolus, of each thrée ounces and a halfe, both kinds of Aristology, of each two ounces, Frankinsence and Myrrhe, of each two ounces and a halfe, prepared Earth wormes, Comfrey and Daisie rootes, of each two ounces, fresh bloud of a heauy minded man sixe ounces, Isingals and Glew as much as is néed∣full: the Gums let steepe thrée dayes in vineger, afterwards temper them with molten pitch and waxe: when it beginneth to be cold, then mingle the other things beaten small amongst it: lastly put the blood thereto, and when it is well mixt, poure it vpon a stone, and worke it very wel with greasie hands, and spred thereof vpon leather, and lay it vpon the rupture vnder the trusse. Another. Take Iron drosse fiue dragmes, Momy, Dragagant and Gum, of each thrée drag. Frankinsence, the iuice of Sloes and Sandaraca, of each one dragme and a half, Isinglas, Cipers nuts, of each one ounce, birdlime thrée ounces, Gips two ounces, Rosin 18. ounces, make there∣of a plaister with the iuice of Celendine. Item take Pitch one ounce, Litharge of gold, red and white waxe, Iewes lime, Ammoniacum and Galbanum, of each one dragme and a halfe, Birdlime one ounce, Turpentine washt with vi∣neger, both kinds of Aristology & Gals, of each two ounces, and two scruples of Cipers nuts, Myrrhe, Frankinsence, of each one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus and Gips, of each one ounce, Mastick, Comfrey and Daisie rootes, of each one ounce, Dragon blood and Momy, of each halfe an ounce, mingle them well together to a plaister. Another: Take the gum of Cherries, dissolue it in Sallad oile, put thereto Mastick and Frankinsence, of each a like much, melt it, and boile it to a plaister. Yet another. Take Gum, Dragagant, Masticke, fine Bolus, Dragon bloud, Isinglas and common Glew, of each one dragme, Frankinsence one dragme and a halfe, Iewes lime halfe an ounce, Pitch and Momy, of each one dragme and a halfe, Tar one quarter of an ounce. First melt the Pitch, then adde the Glew and Tar, and temper then the other things amongst it bea∣ten small. When it is cold, then annoint your hands with oile of Roses, and worke well this salue. This following is taken for a secret: Take Dragon bloud half a dragme, Myrrhe, Sarcocolla, Opopanacum, Brimstone, Amber, Mastick and Comfrey, of each two dragmes and a half, Mirtle séed, yellow Mirobalans, of each two dragmes, the bark of Pineapples, and Cipers nuts, of each foure scruples, foure or fiue garden Snailes out of their houses, Dragagant dissolued in red vi∣neger one dragme▪ fish lime molten in vineger also as much as is needfull for to make the fore∣said things to a plaister: afterwards dry it by a small fire.

But if so be that thrée ounces be too strong to drinke at once, then is he to take but one or two, and this potion may be tempered with somewhat else. A plaister cal∣led De pelle Arietina.Hereafter follow thrée kinds of plaisters De pelle Arietis, which is commended aboue all o∣ther plaisters as a certaine remedy: Take pitch two ounces, Litharge of siluer, Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Mastick, of each one ounce, white and red waxe, Iewes lime, Aloe, and both Aristolo∣gies, of each one ounce and a halfe, Birdlime, fine Bolus, of each three ounces, Gips, Myrrhe, Frankinsence, Turpentine which is washt wel in vineger, prepared earth wormes, Comfrey, Sengréene, of each two ounces and a halfe, halfe a Rams skin made cleane from the haire and wool, and cut smal, the blood of a red bearded yong and healthful man sixe ounces, prepare them al together as herafter followeth: Take the cut rams skin, let it séeth to tough slime, then wring it out hard, and temper amongst it common glew, and fish lime, or Isinglas, of each one ounce and a halfe, afterwards let it séeth well together. You must dissolue the gum in vineger, and you must powne all that is dry: in like maner also the gréene roots, herbes and earth wormes to pa you must worke the birdlime amongst the blood till that it dry, and the plaister waxe hard, then are you to preserue this plaister in a glasse stopt tight.
The second. Take Pitch, Waxe, Iewes lime, both the Aristologies, Earth wormes, prepa∣red Turpentine and Aloe, of each one quarter of an ounce, Litharge of gold, Ammoniacum, Opo∣panacum, Galbanum, Bdellium, Sagapenum, Mastick, Comfrey, and Daisie rootes, of each thrée drag.

Many haue bin cured only herewith. You haue also before in the second part, the first Chapter, 1. §. a plaister which beginneth thus: Take Pitch hafe an ounce, &c. the which is also very good for this purpose. But note, before that you lay the plaister vpon the rupture, rub it with water that is distilled out of a shéepes skin when the wooll is off. Item some other things more to lay thereon: Take the iuice of Sloes, séeth it in water, and lay it on the rupture, and bath the same therwith: it healeth without cutting. For yong children in stéed of this plaister are pultises also to be made, as herafter followeth: Take meale of Lupins and burnt linnen, of each a like much, and make with wine a pap or pultis, and lay it betwéene two fine clothes vpon the rupture. A milder plaister for children. Take Beanes as many as you please, and steepe them in warme water, péele them, and let them dry againe: afterwards stampe them to powder, and take thereof two ounces, small filed Oken wood one ounce, Comfrey sodden treatably in wine, and then stamped, thrée ounces: let all this séeth méetly thick, and spread it on a cloth, and lay it thrée times a day on the rupture, and a nights but one time, and let it be well fastened with a trusse: do this foure or fiue wéekes space vntill the rupture be cured, and the skin pretty strong. Another. Take Consolida Saracenica, Gariophilata, Plantain, Fennel, Sanicle, broad Plantain and Pauls betony, of each one handful, chop all small, and let the plaister séeth vntil it be thick, then lay it on the rupture, and tie it as behooueth. It hath bin told before in the first Chapter how wonderful good this herbe Perfoliata is for all ruptures, which oftentimes hath bin by experience found and approoued. Here follow some salues. Take womans milke 16. ounces, Badgers grease, Capons grease, Harts suet and Comfrey, of each two ounces, the innermost rind of a Cherry trée cut small one ounce and a half; let it séeth so long as a hard egge, straine it hard through a cloth, and therewith annoint the rupture foure wéekes long morning and euening: trusse vp the rupture as behoo∣ueth, and keepe the patient lying still on his backe. Badgers grease is also speciall good for all ruptures. Hereafter are yet more sundry salues described, which are very good for this kind of rup∣ture, and some potions, whereof the first is before described, beginning thus, Take Com∣frey, &c. Item take broad Plantain, Hounds toong, of each half a handfull, Comfrey, Daisie roots, of each half an ounce, Mirtle seeds thrée drag. blossoms of Pomegranats, Bay berries, a drag. and a half, Ladies mantle, Sanicle, Consolida Saracenica, and Agrimony, of each one handfull; seeth them all together in wine and water, of each one pint, vnto the halfe, straine it, and put thereto sugar, at each time one ounce. Item take Sengréene, Consolida Saracenica, red Béets, herbe Benet, Fennell, Knotgrasse, and Pauls Betony, of each one handful; boile them all in wine, and drinke of it twice a day, but not at night. An old body must continue with it twelue wéekes, and a child sixe wéekes. Some adde vnto it Ladies mantle and Sanicle. Item take the roote of the long Consolida, one or twaine, Consolida Saracenica with the roote, Hounds toong with the roote, of Pauls Betony, and rootes of Polipody, of each a like much;
chop it very small, put it in a bag, and put thereto thrée pints of wine, and distill it through a glassen helme, take therof in the morning early a good draught, at afternoone, and in the euening when you go to bed againe: yet at all times warme. Some do make this potion yet stronger, and put halfe an ounce of Perfoliata vnto it, Wa∣tercresses one ounce and a halfe, Cicory rootes one quarter of an ounce, and a pint of red Wine. Or take Comfrey, Consolida Saracenica, Auens, Ladymantle, of each a like much; let it séeth together with good wine in an earthen pot, and drinke thereof betweene meales. Another. If so be that the Rupture be not yet a yéere and a halfe old, then take two pints of small wine in an earthen pot, and put thereto Pirol, S. Iohns woort, and Strawbery leaues, of each one handful, stop the pot close and let the same seeth vntil the second part, and drink there∣of morning & euening méetly warme. This must also be continued two or thrée moneths space, till that he be cured. Now follow some Confections, and such like. Take Calmus and Comfrey, of each one ounce, Solomons seale rootes, Horse tayles, of each halfe an ounce, cut them all small, and let them séeth together in sower wine vntill it may be stamped to pap, and then temper it amongst this powder following: Take Cipers nuts one scruple, small chopt Hares haire halfe a scruple, Ma∣sticke, red Corall, Momy, Sealed earth, Cinnamom, of each fifteene graines, and Cassia woo two scruples. Lastly, take foure ounces of clarified Hony, and temper it to a Confection: thereof may be ta∣ken euery day one dragme. or a drag. and a halfe with wine wherein Cipers nuts are decocted. Item take Corna as many as you please, seeth them in red wine, and straine them. Then take thereof eight or twelue ounces, and seeth the same with sixe ounces of Sugar méetly thicke, and then mingle therewith Hares haire (cut it as small as may be) one scruple, great and small Comfrey, and Tormentill, of each two scruples, herbe Trinity halfe a drag.

Otherwise these things following are counselled much to be vsed: Valerian euery day one dragme taken in wine, Cressy seeds also in wine: but the same must not be vsed oftentimes. Item Shepherds purse cut small and decocted in wine. In like maner also the herb Cardopatium, To foment the Rupture also with these things following, is very good: Take Daisie leaues with red flowers, and Consolida Saracenica, of each a like much, Pauls Betony, Perfoliata, Pyrola, and Watercresses, Harts toong, Cicory, Sanicle, wild Thyme, Cardopatium, and the herb of the same, of each halfe so much, chop it small, and make thereof two bags, séeth them in water, and lay first one bag, and then another, fomenting the Rupture euery time six or seuen houres long. After that, the Rupture must be trussed againe as before. This water may last good three dayes long in the winter time. Item take Rue, Agnus Castus, Marierom, and white Mints, of each one handfull, Annis séed, Fennell seed, Rue séed, and Siluermountaine, of each one dragme; Cammomill, Melilot, of each two ounces; stamp it all together, and let it seeth in a quart of water vntill the third part be sod∣den away; foment therewith the Rupture. This is also good for the Hernia Aquosa, the waterish Rupture, whereof we will hereafter speake more at large. Of the Ruptures that fall downe into the Cods. §. 2. NOw we will speake of the breaches or ruptures that fall downe into the Cods, whereof the causes are diuers, as it standeth here before declared in the fourth §. that they may therefore be holpen by sundry remedies, shall hereafter ap∣péere.
Of the Rupture through wind. §. 3. THe causes of this kind of Rupture may procéed of meates which are windy, as certaine pottages, milke, and all that is drest with milke, all doughy meates and vnleauened bread, sweet Wine, braines and marrow of beasts. Such must beware of cloudy ayre, and all moist dwellings, all heauinesse of the mind, and he must eschew sleepe. Further, sodden fish, moist fruites, great riotting, much exercise immediatly after meales, continuall vse of all moyst meates are hurtfull for this disease. For to cure these Ruptures, it must be endeuored to driue out the winds, for the which at the first this clister is very requisite: Take Comin, Annis, Caraway, Fennell, and Ameos, of each one drag. Rue one handfull and a half, séeth these together in a quart of water vntill the halfe, take twelue ounces of this decoction, oile of Rue, of Bay, of each one ounce and a half, Indy salt, and Sal gemmae, of each halfe a drag. Tho. sugar one ounce and a half, make a clister thereof, and minister it once a day. Secondly, is the patient euery morning to take seuen houres before meat one drag. of Mithridate with two ounces of the water of Rue. This is a diuine medicine to ex∣pell wind, and to take away the occasions thereof. There may a goodly be vsed outwardly, and to take thereof a pint, Sulphur vif beaten two ounces, graines halfe an ounce, beaten grosly, this so sodden together vntill the third part be sodden away: in this warme water wet a sponge, and lay it fiue or sixe times a day vpon the priuities. Secondly, set often copper cups which haue narrow mouthes vpon the belly. For this is also good, all that expelleth wind. Of the waterish Rupture Hernia Aquosa. §. 4. IF any where in the veines, in the pores, or in the liuer or other parts, do gather some water, which falleth downewards, then must it at last fall into the cods: but the Liuer is alwayes the most principall cause from whence all such moistures haue their beginning. Therfore when as all such waterish Ruptures happen to any, it is quickly to be discerned by the nauell or cods, which immediatly afterwards do swell vp, and séeme to be perspicuous, whereto these things following are to be vsed. First of all the patient must be purged; for if such happen not often, the matter of the sicknes will not be caried out of the body. In like sort, if there be not kept a good order of diet, and the water be not expelled, then runneth it againe downwards towards the cods, whereby at length may be caused a greater harme. And to purge all those humors, take this drink following: Take Agaricus and Hermodactili, of each one drag. and a half, Ginger one scrup. Ireos one drag. Hony water foure ounces, then make the Hony water warme, and let the foresaid things be steeped therein 24. houres, afterwards wring it well out, and drinke it warme, and sixe houres after∣wards eate and drinke warme beere and bread vpon it. But if so be this drinke through the bitternesse thereof go against your stomacke, then take this ensuing, Electuarium Indium thrée drag. burnt copper eight graines, water of blew Flower deluce two ounces, temper them all together and drinke it. Or take these pils: Take the root of Laureola, which hath bin stéeped fiue dayes in vineger, one scruple, Sulphur vif foure graines, burnt Copper two graines, Licorice, Annis and Dragagant, of each foure graines, make pils thereof with the iuice of Roses, and take them all at one time. There must also be giuen to this patient those things to ease and drinke which do moue v∣rine, whereof many are specified where we shall speake of the Dropsie Ascite: but of these three things following, chuse which liketh you best. Take red Pease about sixe ounces, two Fennell rootes, let them séeth well together, and take fiue ounces of this decoction: or drinke fiue ounces of Broome water. Thirdly, take the water of Melilot, and water of Smallage, of each two ounces and a halfe, Sugar as much as you please, and drinke this a whole wéeke long.
A Confection to strengthen the Liuer. TAke Trociscos Diarrhodon, and Spec. Diacinamomi, of each one drag. burnt Iuory one scrup. foure ounces of white sugar; séeth it with Fennel water, and make tabulats of it: of these take one quarter of an ounce before meate. When as then through the foresaid meanes the water be somewhat voided, then are these plaisters to be vsed: Take Masticke one ounce, Cipers nuts half an ounce, Dragagant and Gum, of each one drag. temper these togither vnto a plaister with oile of Roses. This stoppeth, that there can no more water run vnto it. Item take Seseli, Comin, Cammomill and Melilot, of each one ounce; séeth these togither in a quart of water vntill the third part be spent, and foment therewith the Rupture. Then lay this plaister vpon it bounden warme to it: Take roots of blew Flowerdeluce, and roots of wild Cucumbers, of each thrée ounces, Pease meale and Beane meale, of each two ounces, oile of Rue and iuice of Bay leaues, of each two ounces; let this séeth till it be méetly thicke, and so lay it vpon the rup∣tures, and bind it warme vnto it. But if this cannot be made, then vse the first with Mastick and Cipers nuts. The Apothecaries haue also one in vse, which they call Emplaistrum ad Rupturas, which is also very good, and is thus to be made. Take Nutmegs, the iuice of Sloes, Gips, Comin, Annis, Rice, Pyrola, sower Dates, Cipers nuts, Sanicle, of each one dragme and a halfe, fish lime or Isinglasse, halfe an ounce, Bdellium two ounces: but dissolue the two last in vineger, and with the rest beaten small make a plaister of it. Another. Take Bran twelue ounces, beate it very small, and let it run through a séene, put amongst it two ounces of beaten Comin, make a plaister of it with Oxymel. You may also seeth it well with white wine vnto a plaister. Item take Lilly rootes one ounce, Linséed meale one quarter of an ounce, Beane meale one drag. Comin and wild Rape seed, of each one ounce, Sulphur vif one quarter of an ounce, Cipers nuts one dragme, Bdellium molten in vineger halfe an ounce: beate all that is to be beaten, and let it seeth to a plaister with white wine. Item take Marioram, foment therewith the whole priuities, or annoint it with the iuice of Yarrow: take also oyle of Pepper and of Saffron, of each a like much, and therewith annoint the rup∣ture. But if so be that this waterish rupture be taken for a species of the Dropsie, then must you looke for moe other plaisters, which stand described in the treatise of the Dropsie Ascite, and choose which you like best. But if the water (which is so gathered together) must be let out, then are you after the purgation to lay the foresaid plaister vpon it, and open the cod, yet let not the water run out all at once, and being run out, then lay drying plaisters vpon it. It is also opened sundry wayes, as with a hot yron, with a thred thrust through it, also with a coro∣siue, and otherwise, which we commend to the Chirurgians. But if so be that you be once cured, and that the same returne againe, then is he to be ruled in all things, like as is from the beginning hitherto prescribed. Of the Rupture through Bloud or Phlegma. §. 5. ALthough that out of al the humors of mans body, there be specially caused foure ruptures, yet notwithstanding is the same very seldom caused through Cholera. In like maner also not often of blood, vnlesse that such hapneth through strokes, wounds fals, cariage, and through vse of meates which make much bloud, that be very hot, moist, and swéet, and such like. These ruptures do make shew with notorious swellings, with heate, & many humors, which may easily be knowne by their féeling, for at the last they will be red, and beating or panting. The Liuer or Median veine is to be opened of such a patient, and foure or fiue ounces of bloud letten out, according to the strength of the patient. And the next day must he purge with this potion following: first,Decoctio fru∣ctuum. must you make ready a decoction, which the Apothecaries do call Decoctio fructuum, as followeth. Take figs and Prunes, of each fiftéene, Iuiubes and Sebestes, of each twenty, Hops a
handfull and a halfe, Endiue, Purslaine and Cicory, of each halfe a handfull, péeled Melon séed, Pompeon séed, Cucumber seed, and péeled Gourd seed, of each one dragme, sower Dates one ounce, Violets halfe an ounce; séeth these all together (except the Dates) and breake them into this decoction, it is very good for the breast, and cooleth naturally, take of it thrée ounces, Rubarb two scruples, Spica foure graines, conserue of Prunes halfe an ounce, temper these well toge∣ther, and drinke it warme, and fast thereupon the space of sixe houres. The same day lay vpon the rupture sixe ounces of greene Nightshade, but if you cannot get it, then take dried Roses and broad Plantaine, of each two ounces, Linseed sodden in vineger, twelue ounces, barly meale fiue ounces, oile of Roses foure ounces; let all these séeth together vnto a thick pap by a mild fire treatably, and then lay this vpon it twice a day. Item take water of Endiue, Nightshade, barly water, and beane water, of each a like much, temper amongst it a litle saffron and oile of Roses, make it wet in a cloth and lay it theron. Or take Barly meale, Lentil meale, Beane meale and Violets, of each a like much, temper these all together with the iuice of the herbe of winter Che∣ries vnto a plaister or salue, and vse it as aboue. But if so be that the paine of this accident wil not stanch, then powne Henbane amongst it. The third day must two cups be set behind on the buttocks, and that at such time as the patient hath least paine, letting them draw much bloud. His meates must be cooling and drying, as Veriuice, the iuice of Pomegranats, &c. His drinke must be sower and thin wine. This is also to be noted, that this kind of rupture is of that nature that it may be cured in eight dayes. But the rupture which is caused of phlegmatick humors, is much more common, and they that gladly haunt strange women, are more subiect to these ruptures. Also all they that liue rio∣tously, eate hard meates, and haue sate vpon a cold stone with their naked body, which may be knowne through the coldnesse of the disease, when it beginneth to mollifie, and when one doth thrust his finger into it, that the dent of the finger tarieth a good while in it, which in the windy rupture nor in the water rupture hapneth not to be. Also the place is not perspicuous, and the swelling remaineth at a stay. This disease is to be cured with these purgations following: Take Turbith one quarter of an ounce, Ginger one dragme, white sugar thrée dragmes, tem∣per them together: of this must the patient euery fourth day take one dragme with Worme∣wood water, and betwéen them must he euery morning take this potion: Take water of Balme, Betony and Wormewood, of each one ounce and a halfe, Sugar halfe an ounce, Vineger of Squils one ounce, mixe them together. Now for to strengthen the parts wherein the phleg∣matick humor ingendreth, it is very good euery morning to take one dragme of Treacle which is ten yéeres old. This plaister following is also maruellous good for to consume all such mat∣ter: Take Sandaraca two ounces, Sarcocolla one ounce, ashes of Beane straw, or Vine stockes sixe ounces, Vineger of Squils two ounces, as much water as is néedful: let these séeth together vnto the thicknesse of a plaister, and lay it vpon the sore as aboue. Some do take in steed of com∣mon ashes, the ashes of Saponaria, which may be well done. Of the fleshie Rupture. §. 6. THis rupture may also ingender of good bloud, for that the nourishing opera∣tion doth works so vehemently therein, that the bloud turneth into flesh. It may also be caused through great heate of the cods. When as then this excres∣cence of the flesh doth much increase, then will this member be much féebled, and the new flesh which at the first was not hurtfull, will be vtterly destroyed. This excrescence of flesh, or fleshy rupture, is first of all knowne, for that therewith is no paine at all. The heate is to be knowne by the rednesse of the place where the disease appéereth, and by the hardnesse it is also knowne, for that it agreeth with other flesh. Lastly, it is also to be discerned and knowne by the speedy increasing, by reason that sometimes it will be as big as ones head. The outward causes of the fleshy rupture are all that ouerheate and ouermoisten, whereby the bloud inflameth and will be fat, euen as all delicate meates, yolks of egs, good fresh broth, swéet Wines, Dates, Sugar, and all that is drest therewith, and such like. For to remedy this, first the Liuer veine or the Median is to be opened, and that at seuerall times, first one, then another. Secondly, you must looke to open the hemorrhoides in the fundament, through continual rubbing it with Oxe gall or with water wherein Sulphur vif is
decocted. Thirdly, through often applying great cups vpon the buttocks, hips, and other fleshy parts. He must eate no other meates than that are cooling and drying, thereby to hinder the ge∣neration of the bloud: for which this plaister following is also to be layd therupon: Take Len∣til, Nightshade, Roses, and broad Plantaine, of each sixe ounces, Barly meale twelue ounces, three whites of egges: seeth these all together in sufficient vineger, and thrice as much wa∣ter, then make thereof a plaister, and lay it vpon the whole cod fiue or sixe dayes one after an other. Now when as this patient hath purged, and done all that is prescribed, then is this plaister following to be layd vpon the rupture: Take Bolus two ounces, sealed earth and starch, of each one drag. Mil dust one ounce and a half, Sandaraca and Mastick, of each one quarter of an ounce, make a salue thereof with the iuice of Roses in a leaden mortar, and lay thereof twice a day o∣uer the rupture. Afterwards vse this corroding ointment: Take blacke Sope two ounces, Orpiment one ounce and a halfe, Sulphur vif halfe an ounce, burnt Copperas one dragme and a half, temper all together in a mortar with water wherein Sal Armoniack is dissolued: lay this vpon the lower part of the cod, about the breadth of a groate, and let it lie therein about one houre, but no longer, so that it may not bite in too déepe. When there is any vlcer, then lay easie things thereon, as Barrowes grease or butter vntill that the escarre fall off. When this is all done, then take for this the salue of the Apostles: afterwards are you to lay this biting salue againe vpon another place of the cod, so that it may be opened in sixe or eight places, yet so, that one may commodiously come to it with the foresayd things. When you then sée that such excres∣cens be consumed, which may be discerned and knowne hereby, that the cod is come to his wonted bignesse againe, the which sometimes hapneth to endure halfe a yéere before it come thereto, then must you procéed with incarnatiues, which things require an expert and pati∣ent Chirurgian. Of the Rupture which is caused of broken veines, called Varicosa. §. 7. HEreof we haue in the beginning of the 4. §. made mention, how that it is none other but an intumefaction of the veines through blood, for in the cods are many veines that compasse them all about. This tumor or rupture procéedeth of melancholick blood, to which do help sor∣row, vexation of the mind, many fantasies, and grosse meates, whereof the me∣lancholik blood is ingendred: like as also of grosse red wine, salt flesh, pottage of Beanes and Lentils, and all that is drest with sharp vineger. Such a patient is to rule himselfe no otherwise then is taught in the fleshy rupture, but that he must not vse any of the corroding salue, but in stéed thereof vse the plaisters De Musci∣laginibus, and especially those that be made with Opopanaco, Serapino, Bdellio and Ammoniaco. For this is also good bathes which are Sulphurish, Copperish, and warme by nature. And (to speake the truth) this species of rupture is not to be holpen but with great paines, and conti∣nuance of time. Of the terrible Rupture, called Buris. §. 8. THis rupture commeth also through melancholick blood, which not only falleth downe into the cods, but also infecteth them wholly, so that beyond all measure it commeth thereby to swell, yea will be black and cold, and sometimes without any vlceration. But if so be that there come vnto it any hard swellings, which afterwards breake out and yéeld much matter, then may the same be wel taken for Elephantiasis: yet if so be that the swelling be not so big, and hath neuertheles the foresaid signes, then is it to be taken for the right Hernia Oscenae, which some do call Ossealis, which altogether descendeth into the cods. This disease will be cured like other hard swellings, or as hereafter followeth. Take beane meale thrée ounces, Cammomill, muscilage of Hollihocke rootes, Annise séed,
Fenegréeke séed, and Raisins without stones, of each halfe an ounce; temper them with yolks of egs. These things following are good for plaisters; as Cumin, Nightshade, Beane meale, Cam∣momil, Melilot, oile of Lillies, Cow dung, crums of Rie bread, and moe other things aforesaid. But if so be that the hardnesse wil not weare away, but inclineth to maturation, then must the same be opened and healed as other impostumations. The plaister Diachilon is good to be vsed at the first, and the gum Ammoniacum by it selfe; for that they either consume or maturate the swelling in short space. There is also good for this Beane meale, Fenegréeke meale, Lilly roots, Colewoort leaues, and figs, as much as you please, sodden together, and then powned, and so layd vpon the griefe. Also this rupture is to be often∣times annointed with the oile of Cammomill, Lillies and Spike, and chiefly when there is no speciall heate therein. It is also to be noted, that it is not good, if it be knowne that the Cod is full of matter or corruption, to leaue the same long therein, lest that the testicles thereby might also spoile and putrifie. For this is this rule to be obserued, to the end that in time the melancholike humors might be drawne out and purged away; to wit, to open the Liuer veine on the left side. The next day must he take half an ounce of Catharticum Imperiale, with Violet or Waterlilly water. Now for to cause the matter to discusse and consume, take sixe or eight dayes one after another these potions following: Take Violet water, Lettice water, and Hop water, of each one ounce, sirupe of Citron pils one ounce and a halfe: take this warme early in the morning. Of the Ruptures whereby the Bowels do fall into the Cods. §. 9. THe eight and last sort of ruptures is here aboue mentioned in the title. The descen∣ding of the bowels or rim, is oftentimes very sodainly, and otherwhiles very slow∣ly. But howsoeuer the same come, yet for all that can it not be without paine, and chiefly if it be touched: the inward causes are none other then wind which cléerely appeareth hereby; if the patient hold vp his breath long, the rupture will be the greater, and in breathing out the smaller. The outward causes are sufficiently expressed in the treatise of the Ruptures of wind, and of the Nauell. For to helpe this disease, before all things diligence must be had, that the bowels which are descended may be brought againe into their place. And for to compasse this, take hold on the cods vnderneath, and treatably thrust it vp. Take also a great boxing cup, set it aboue the pri∣uities or hard by, and let it draw a good space. The patient must also lie higher with his but∣tockes than his body, that the bowels thereby the easier may returne into their due places. If there be any great paine approching, then first of all looke to swage the same, and chiefly with clisters, which are thus to be made; to wit, the decoction wherein Linseed, Fenegreeke, and white Sesamum seeds beaten grosly haue bene boyled, and therewith butter and oyle of Vio∣lets be mixed. Item, take Hens and Cocks broth, and oyle of Sesamum, of each sixe ounces, Sal gemmae halfe an ounce, or a little lesse; temper them together, and minister this Clister meetly warme. Another. Take twelue ounces of swéet Wine, fresh butter, and oile of sweet Almonds, of each two ounces, Benedicta lax. halfe an ounce; temper them all together for a clister. Further, the whole Cods with all parts that are adioyning are to be wel fomented or bathed. What waters are to be taken for it, you haue them set downe before in the end of the first §. be∣ginning thus, Take Rue, &c. Yet another in the fourth §. beginning thus, Take Seeli or Siluer mountaine séed, &c. In one of these warme decoctions wet a great sponge, and lay it ouer all the priuities: which being done, then let the rupture be softly shooued backe. Afterwards must you lay this plaister following ouer it, and bind it as hard as may be abidden and suffered. Take Cipers rootes two ounces, Mill dust three ounces, Comfrey and Daisie rootes, of each one ounce, fish lime or Isinglas, one ounce and a halfe, Dragagant, Gumme, Momy, and burnt Iuory, of each halfe an ounce Dragon blood, Sagapenum, Sealed earth, and fine Bolus, of each fiue dragmes: the meale and powned rootes shall you séeth in two third parts of water, and one third part of red vineger, vntill it be thicke inough; then mixe molten Waxe amongst it as much as is needfull, stirre it with dissolued Gum well together vntill it be cold. You haue also
before in the discourse of the Nauell and vpper Rupture, many good plaisters which are good for this vse. But if so be that the rupture be large, and al that is falne downe be much, then lay the plaister thereon which is described in the treatise of the vpper rupture, in the beginning of the 1. §. for it is singular good also for this kind of rupture. Make a plaister thereof after the forme of a shield, whereof the narrowest end may passe vnder the cods betwéene the legs, and the broad end ouer the whole cods: this being done, then put thereon an accustomed trusse. Lastly, héed must be taken to cure and strengthen the place of the rupture where the bowels come through: for the which this following is very commodious. Take iron drosse which is sodden in vineger and Myrrhe, of each halfe an ounce, Dragon blood, fine Bolus, Frankinsence, Mastick, Sealed earth, and the iuice of Sloes, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cipers nuts and Momy, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Isinglas two ounces, temper them al together with Waxe and Rosin as much as is néedful for a salue, and therwith annoint the Cods thrice a day, and knit it vp with the trusse as is vsuall. If the rupture be not too wide and too old, then may it be well cured therewith in orty or threescore dayes. Of the Ruptures of Children. §. 10. THe yong children are subiect to the foresaid ruptures of wind and water, more than aged folke, and are also to be cured with the foresaid remedies. Concerning the vpper rupture of children, especiall mention is made in the fift §. But as in the beginning of this description we haue said that children and tender bodies are to be dealt withall more milder and subtiller than with aged folkes, therefore is the same to be had in mind. For the first, these are as much as is possible to be defended and kept from crying, and to be let lie with stretched out legs, and after the first binding not to vnbind it in ten dayes. If the rupture as then be not yet cured, then is the rupture the second and third times to be trussed, for that by the first trusse they heale not throughly, but all after as they be still or vnruly. But if the children be so small that they suck still; then must the mother or the nurse kéepe a good diet in eating and drinking of dry meates: and they must eschue all meates which be moist of nature. For to keepe vp the Matter that it descend no more. §. 11. FOr this purpose are good the last mentioned clisters, the binding and rubbing of the knées downewards, the setting vp of boxing cups on the buttocks vnpickt, the opening of the liuer veine or Median, wherwith also according to the importance of the cause, remedies must be vsed through vomits, whereby the matter that fal∣leth out of the head will be diuerted: for all ruptures are much subiect to the de∣fluxion of humors, and especially the great ruptures. Lastly, it is very necessary that women do further their Floures or Termes; and for men, the Hemorrhoides or Piles. For to stay the reuersion of the Rupture that it come not againe. §. 12. THis must be effected through such things as expell wind and flegmatick matters, whereof is sufficient store declared, and chiefly that which hath Turbith in it, in the 5. §. If you had rather haue pils, then take Coloquint one scruple, Turbith one dragme, Bdellium one dragme, and Ginger one scruple; make thereof twelue pils with Hiera logodion, whereof the patient is to take thrée in the morning early, and thereupon drinke one ounce of the water of blew Flower de luce méetly warme and sugred. This medicine is good for all flegmatick diseases. This foresaid matter wil be expelled through these things following by vrine: Take water of Broome, Madder, and Smallage, of each one ounce and a halfe, temper it, and drinke thereof about halfe an ounce at a time: and immediatly afterwards take thrée pils of powned Millium solis séed, mixt with the iuice of Smallage:
or take one dragme of beaten Lignum Aloes, with Hony water. Also you may vse twice a wéeke one dragme of Mithridate, tempered with Mint water. Thirdly there is a strong confection discouered, made by Nicholaus, by the name of Opopyra, which hath a speciall operation to dry vp the flegmaticke humors. And if you desire to make the same, then are you to vse the aduice of an expert Phisition, for it is very hot. There are also sim∣ples, which be very necessary for to stay the bowels after the first curing from falling down in∣to the cods any more: whereof, the first are Cipers nuts, when they are gréene to confect them with sirupe of Roses, wherof one is to be taken thrée or foure houres before meate, and that con∣tinuing two or thrée moneths long. Secondly, after the same manner shall be confected Pine∣apples (the kernels being taken out) and vse them in like manner. Thirdly, take one dragme of Momy, and make therewith twelue pils with the iuice of Roses, and take thereof alwayes thrée houres before meate, one, two, or thrée moneths space together. Fourthly, you are to swal∣low euery morning threée or foure péeces of Masticke, and continue it thrée or foure moneths: it is the most surest. Fiftly, you are foure houres before meate to take a roote of Consolida media. Sixtly, the powder of Cipers nuts is to be vsed in all meates. Seuenthly, there must be worne a plate of filed iron vpon the rupture. Eightly, the patient is to sit oftentimes in an Allum bath, which is very sure to preuent the recediue of all such accidents. For this may be prepared these confections following: Take Frankinsence, Mastick, the iuice of Sloes, Hypocistis, of each one dragme and a halfe, Roses, burnt Iuory, parched Comin, Dill séed, of each one dragme, Cipers nuts halfe an ounce, small filed Stéele, Iron drosse, decocted to∣gether in red vineger, of each one quarter of an ounce, dried séeds of Pomegranates one ounce; beate them all small together: Hony of Roses eighteene ounces, white Sugar twelue ounces, Granado wine sixe ounces, Dragagant, Gum, of each halfe an ounce; séeth both of these gums with Hony, Sugar, and this iuice vntill it be thicke. When it beginneth to be cold, put it into a mortar, and temper the other things amongst it, stirring it well about, and giue the sicke body thereof two dragmes in the morning two houres before meate: also two houres after supper one dragme. With this haue many béene cured. The order of life or diet. §. 13. EVen as all diseases in the world haue néed of a good diet, so hath this malady most of all néed of it: but if the patient do not gouerne himself in this sicknes as it behooueth, then are all medicines of none effect, but in vaine. For this is first required to keepe himself as quiet as is possible, and to ly vpon his back. The patient is also forbidden all cold and moist places, carnall copula∣tion, much stirring after meate. To ouercharge himselfe with meate and drinke is also very hurtful vnto him, all strong drinks, and chiefly Must or new wine is forbidden him. All meates that are binding, as sad baked bread, and all that is made of meale and dough must he forbeare. Of all sorts of pottages, there are none more hurtful than Beanes, Turky beanes, and Lentils: contrariwise, he may eate wel smoke dried flesh, and all kinds of fish: but new milk, and all that is made thereof, is hurtful for him. Item butter; and all cold and moist herbes must he forbeare, as Spinage, Lettice, Béets, Mallowes, Purslaine, &c. vnlesse they be mingled with some warme herbes, as Rosemary, Mints, Thyme, Marioram, and such like. Meates that are good for him, are well leauened bread not aboue thrée dayes old, Brewesse of fresh flesh broth, reare Egs, Veale, Mutton, Porke, Hares: Item Capons, Hens, Phesants, Partridges, Ducks, Doues, and all other field fowles. All fish fried in oile, and salt fish may he vse otherwhiles, &c. Hard salt Chéese is also sometimes permitted. All sorts of Turneps, Oliues and Capers may he also vse. All maner of spice may he eate drest with his meate. Also Annis séed, fennell séed, Comin, and such like. All maner of sower things in his meates cannot hurt him, as Vineger, Veriuice, Limons, Orenges, and such like. For his drinke shall be good cleere wine or béere. But if the patient can neither drinke wine nor béere, then is he to vse this Meade following. Take Rosemary halfe an ounce, Cinnamom halfe a dragme, Balme flowers, Ginger, Bor∣rage, Nutmegs, of each halfe a dragme: séeth these together in seuen quarts of water vntill the fourth part be sodden away: afterwards put thereto sixtéene ounces of hony, let it séeth againe vntill the third part be consumed.
This drinke is speciall good in the winter, and if the same be not continually vsed, yet may the wine be delayed with it. This order is as well directed for flegmaticke humors, as for the cause whereof this rupture hath his being. And if the same be caused of Cholera and blood, we haue thereof discoursed before. The Chirurgions haue two other meanes to heale the Rupture, which is, by incision, and with cautarisation, whereof we are not purposed to write. The fourth Chapter. Of the Testicles or Stones. SOme do name both these parts, the priuities: which name doth signifie more than the stones onely of men or women, for that it is thought to be too grosse a terme, the stones: but if the matter b honest which is spoken of them, then can the true name of them not be shamefull nor dishonest. Both these small parts of a mans body were once fashioned thereto by God and nature (like as is discouered) whereby to continue mankind: for which cause they are by good reason accounted amongst the principal∣lest parts of mans body. For how greatly mankind is depending theron, it is to be séen by such whose stones be cut out, who haue no beards grow∣ing, do lose their mans voice and naturall heate, yea are wholy vnfit for generation: In fine, do almost alter wholy into the nature of women, we may therfore with good reason write thereof. Men and women haue both of them two of these stones, therfore do the Grecians call them Didymi, which is, Twins or Twilings. In men they hang outwardly out of the body in the abouesaid cods, and are of a fast fleshy substance, round and somewhat long, inwardly hollow∣ish, wherein they receiue the purest and cleanest blood of the whole body: and for that they be hot and moist, they prepare that for the full perfection of the séed. Women haue the stones inward, on each side of the neck of the Mother one: but they are much lesse than the stones of a man, and also of another fashion. It is also adiudged, that the right stone is hotter of nature than the left; therefore the right also (is sayd) will ingender a son, and the left a daughter. It is found by ex∣perience, if a man haue one stone cut out, yet may he ingender children: likewise they that haue three stones are very vnchast of life. Of the diseases which these members of the body are subiect vnto, is sufficiently discoursed in the treatise of the Cods: for there can hardly come any infir∣mity to the cods, wherein they do not suffer with them, whether they chaunce to swell through wind, or any other humor. But chiefly yong children get lightly such diseases: for which you haue this plaister following for to vse, as well for yong as for aged folkes: Take Lilly rootes foure ounces, Linséed meale, Beane meale, halfe an ounce, yellow wild Rape séed half an ounce, Sulphur vife one dragme, make a plaister thereof. But before you lay on the plaister, annoint the place with oile of Pepper and Saffron, of each half an ounce, temper them, and vse it warme. Another plaister. Take small beaten Annis séeds, temper them with well brayed whites of egs, and lay warme vpon it. This is approoued and found good. The fift Chapter. Of VVomens priuie Members. THe Priuities of women make outwardly a small shew, but within are much like to the priuy members of a man. The neck of the Mother or Womb is in stéed of the Yard: the Mother or Wombe is compared with the Cods, where on the necke of the same (like as is sayd) the stones are fixed: so that with good reason may be sayd, That whatso∣euer men haue outwardly, the same haue women inwardly: but for honesties sake we will write no further of it. But as much as concer∣neth the inward parts thereof, and all that appertaineth thereto,
shall be discouered hereafter: here shall only be touched certaine diseases which these parts are subiect to. For which, first of all the common aduise of women is against all paine of these parts, be it of whatsoeuer cause that the same proceed, to wit, that Betony be layd to steepe in Wine, and to drinke thereof. Of the inflammation of the place with swel∣lings. §. 1. TAke the whites of Egs, and bray them with a long péece of Allume a good space, then will it be a salue; spread it vpon a cloth, and so apply it, and when it is dry refresh it: this hath beene many times approoued and found certaine. Item take of the white of an egge half a nutshell full, and Sallad oile, stirre them wel to∣gether, and therewith annoint the hot burnt place. Or take the gréene and yellow barke of Elderne sticks, put them in a little bag, boile them in wine, and lay them warme theron; it driueth away all swelling, as wel that which is caused of childbirth, as otherwise. Item, take for the hot swelling of womens priuy places, Consolida Saracenica, Auens, and La∣dies mantle, as much as you please: powne them all together, and wring out the iuice, tem∣per it with molten Capons grease and fresh butter, annoint the place therewith betwéene day and night foure times at the least. Of the Clefts of this place. §. 2. THe Grecians do call these clefts Rhagades, and are such clefts as discouer them∣selues with excrescence of flesh, which for the most part standeth alwayes inward, and bléedth not of it selfe, vnlesse they be rubbed hard with the member of a man, which procéedeth of inward & outward causes. The outward causes may be fals, strokes, or bignes of a mans member: Also through putting in any sharp thing, as Gith séed, & such like. The inward occasions are, when as any inward swelling hapneth through descent of some sharp humor which there seeketh issue; and (to tell the truth) this is very hardly to be healed, especially when all such diseases do stand deep in the necke of the mother. But these clefts are to be healed with the same remedies which shortly hereafter in the treatise of the Ars∣gut shall be described, yet if there be no Ague nor sharpnes present, then may these pessaries fol∣lowing be vsed. Take Ducks grease, and the marrow of a Stags bone, of each halfe an ounce, Saffron one scruple, oyle of Lillies and of white Daffodill, of each one quarter of an ounce, Waxe as much as is néedfull, wherewith to frame pessaries. These pessaries must be put vp into the place, yet bounden at a threed, they draw the clefts together. Item take Frankinsence and Hypocistis, of each halfe a dragme, Aloe halfe a scruple, Dragon blood three dragmes, the iuice of Sloes one dragme, dried Asse dung one ounce, dried Mints a scruple, burnt Egshels one dragme and a half, three whites of Egs, burnt paper two scruples, thrée ounces of the iuice of broad Plantain, Vineger one quarter of an ounce, temper them all together: it is especiall good for all clefts of the whole body. But if so be that there be any heate or sharpnesse therewith, then is oyle of Roses to be vsed for it, and the pessaries must be annointed with this white vnguent: or make a pessary of Cotton, stéeped in Rose water or Plantaine water. But if the heate therof be great, take the iuice of Purslaine, muscilage of Fleawort, and iuice of Housléeke: worke this the space of certaine houres in a leaden mortar, and temper a little oyle of Roses amongst it: this hea∣leth and cooleth. It is also very good against the Canker of the Mother, and such like diseases. Item take Dragagant and Gum, dissolued in Rose water, washed Aloe, Ceruse, Frankin∣sence, and Dragon bloud, of each one dragme, litharge of Gold halfe an ounce, oyle of Roses two ounces, waxe as much as is néedful; stamp all that is to be stamped, and make a salue of it. Also this hereafter following may with a Siring be squirted into the place: Take washed white bread, Frankinsence, Bolus, and Dragon blood, of each one ounce, powne it, and séeth it in foure ounces of Goates milke vnto the half, then straine it through a cloth, and vse it as hath béene sayd.
Of the Vlceration in the priuities of Women. §. 3. AL that is ordained herebefore for the clefts, is also good for all vlcerations of the priuities in women: so is also in like manner that which followeth hereafter: Take fresh butter, Badgers grease, and Deeres suet, of each one ounce, the mar∣row of a yong Steere halfe an ounce, fiue beaten yolkes of Egs; temper them all together ouer a mild fire, and stirre it continually: when as it is almost cold, then put thereto Violets, Cammomill, and Roses, of each one ounce, oile of O∣liues one ounce and a half: let this séeth softly one quarter of an houre, stirring it alwayes about: afterwards straine it through a cloth. Item take Barrowes grease wherin Dill hath bin fried, May butter, and Harts suet, of each two ounces, Sallad oyle one ounce and a half, the marrow of a yong Stéere, and Roses, of each one ounce, Violets, Cammomill, of each one dragme and a halfe, sixe yolkes of egs well beaten, temper it as before: you may put thereto a little Beuercod, this is, the elder, the better. For a generall rule note, that whereas any vlceration or clefts do show themselues outwardly, that for the same these foresaid remedies are commodious: if so be that they stand déepe in the neck of the Mother, then vse the foresaid pessaries, and thrust them in déepe inough, for which cause the pessaries must be reasonable long. Also for all swellings and exulcerations vse the oyle of white Daffodill, for it is very much approoued for it. When any body catcheth any sore through carnall copulation. §. 4. THis is to be vnderstood of any sore which commonly commeth through copulation or ve∣nery. For this you shall take Calues suet, letting it melt treatably vpon hote coles, then temper therewith the marrow of an Oxe: when it is molten, let it be cold: when you will vse this, then take a little of it and annoint the sore therewith. But if it hapned that one haue his ordure to come forth before, then take a small Tunnell, and stick it into the funda∣ment, like as it were a Clister pipe, then poure therein the molten fat, but not too hot. The patient must also keepe in his breath, and afterwards plucke out the Tunnell, and so stop the fundament with Cotton, that the same fat might not run out againe. And two or thrée dayes after he must bathe in warme water, or foment with a bag that is filled with Oken leaues, Plantaine and Roses, and is decocted in water. For to make a Woman to be as narrow as a Maiden. §. 5. TAke Consolida Saracenica, Plantaine, red Roses, and Shepherds purse, of each a like much, and chop them small: when you haue two handfuls of them, then take a pound of May butter; melt it, and put thereto the sayd herbes: then let all séeth softly together halfe an houre long; afterwards straine it through a cloth, and therewith annoint the place. Item take Coperas and let it dissolue in well water, wet a cloth therein, and lay it in the place; but it must otherwhiles be refreshed. If then one be troubled with the Crablice, looke the first part, in the third Capter, in the 8. §. where is sufficiently written of Lice. For to speake then more at large of this matter, and to declare (like as is said already) how much importeth mankind in the soundnesse and health of these parts of generation, therefore we will first speake of the Spermaticall fluxe or running of the raines, be it by day or night: af∣terwards of the impossibility of the veneriall act: Thirdly, of the barrennesse both of man and woman, and how to redresse it. Fourthly, what belongeth to the Secundina or Skin wherein the child is wrapt, we will shew hereafter. The sixt Chapter. Of the Spermaticall Fluxe or running of the Raines. THe Grecians do call this infirmitie Gonorrhaeam, which is, when one against his will, without the erection of the Yard hath his séed running out, through the losse of his strength and vnnaturall heate. This is caused through the féeblenesse of the vertue retentiue, which is in the instruments of the séed, which may happen
through any ouercoldnesse, be it by sitting on cold stones, or otherwise. It is else daily séene, if any beare this mischiefe too long, that he waxeth leane thereby, and falleth away. And it is also no wonder, that by reason of this fluxe of the seed which sometimes ten yea twenty times hap∣neth betwéene day and night, that therby the best nourishment of the body is withdrawn. If so be then that this Spermaticall fluxe is caused through weaknesse of the retentiue vertue, then hapneth it without féeling: or if it happen through the force of the vertue expulsiue, which is knowne before by certaine impotency and trouble of these parts. But if the same grow through outward accidents, that must be vnderstood of the patient. And to cure this infirmity, first it is to be knowne, that albeit this disease procéedeth for the most part through heate, yet notwithstan∣ding the same may be caused through cold, therefore we will here first write of the running of the Raines which commeth through heate. Of the Fluxe of seed, or running of the Raines through heate. §. 1. THis fluxe of séed, is (as it hath bin sayd) felt with some griefe. All cold things are acceptable to the patient, and hot things do put him to paine, as to a man which is superabounding in seed, doth this fluxe of Sperme bring not any feeblenes, & he waxeth not thereby leane at all: but if such come through heate of the seed, then fee∣leth he also heate, itching and griefe: this must first of all be begun with a good or∣der of diet. And first he must chuse for his dwelling a place and ayre which is neither too hot nor too cold, neither too moist nor too dry. It is also not conuenient for him to stirre or go much, neither to ride: but rest and sleepe is highly commended for this infirmity, and not too long, but a little, and that oftner. Déepe speculations, sorrow, vexation, fright, feare, and especially all ve∣neriall thoughts must he eschue. All purgations, and that which abateth the body are very hurtfull: and if need require, the same is easily to be effected through vomits, sweates, and Clisters. For vomiting, take water (wherein Radishes haue béene sodden) thrée ounces, sirupe of Vineger one ounce and a halfe, giue the patient this warme, after that he hath eaten sundrie meates. For to prouoke sweate, take Barly water thrée ounces, strong Wine two ounces, giue it him very warme, and let him sweat. The clister must be thus prepared: Take Beets, Violet leaues, Nightshade, Tassell leaues, of each one handfull, let them seeth well together, and take twelue ounces of this decoction, Tho. sugar one ounce and a halfe, yolkes of Egs, oile of water Lillies, and of Roses, of each two ounces, salt one dragme and a halfe: the clister must be set in the eue∣ning before meate. In eating and drinking must be eschued all that nourish wel, except there be great féeblenes approching, whereof ought most of al to be aduised. Also he must eschue al that prouoketh vene∣nery, as all sharp hot meates, spices, fat and windy meates: but much rather may he vse all that are contrary to these, as water wherein Lentils are sodden, and Waterlillies tempered in al his meates and drinkes: also conserues of the same. Prepared Coriander is also good, be it of what maner soeuer they be eaten. These things haue a speciall property to expell incontinency. In like sort also Purslaine, Endiue, Cicory, and Lettice. But Lettice seed excelleth all these, if one eate much thereof: it stayeth also excéedingly and spéedily the running of the Raines. Item, oile Oliue and Nightshade, are very good for this. All these foresaid things is such a patient to vse continually, meetly sower vineger, Oranges, and the iuice of Pomegranats may he also vse o∣therwhiles, and herewith eate shéepes feet, and other beasts feet. Fish that are taken in fresh wa∣ters, are also good for him, with vineger and other sower things, and dressed with sallad oile. All sea fish shall he forbeare. Concerning flesh, there is good all kind of Venison, water Fowles, and in fine, the flesh of all Déeres that be not fat, but in good plight. For his drinke must he haue red cléere and pleasant Wines, and if he desire to haue them watred, then take thereto water wherein Coriander, Lettice, Purslaine, (and that which is yet better) Gum of Araby, and dried Waterlilly flowers haue béene decocted. And that we forget not the venerious and lusty women, it is specially aduised, that for them shall be made a potion of the iuice of Betony and Cicory tempered together with vineger.
Item, yet more against concupiscence of man and woman that are hot of nature, may plaisters be made: Take Henbane, Opium, Camfere, the muscilage of Fleawoort, Purslaine séed, and oyle of Poppy seed, make a plaister thereof, and annoint or lay it vpon the kidneyes. Yet must this plaister by reason of the extreme coldnes be vsed prouidently. Also to go bare footed is good like∣wise for this: and they that be full of blood are to be let blood. These things following do much drie the naturall séed, to wit, Rue, and Agnus castus, wild Mints, Comin, and morsels made thereof. But chiefly if one do take the séeds of the premisses with vineger. Item take Dill séed thrée dragmes, Lettice séed, and Purslaine séed, of each half an ounce; drinke thereof euery time one dragme and a halfe with the water of Lentils. Item take Rue séed and Henbane séed, of each one quarter of an ounce, Roses and flowers of Pomegranats of each thrée dragmes: make thereof a powder, and giue thereof to drink one quarter of an ounce at one time with water or watered wine. But to returne to the léesing of the Sperme, it is not amisse to write what is inwardly to be vsed for it. First then shall this confection following be necessary for it: Take Comfrey roots thrée ounces, cleanse them and cut them small, pilled Pom∣peon seed and Waterlillies, of each one dragme, the iuice of Licorice two scruples, prepared Co∣rall, fine Bolus, Mirtle séed and Roses, of each ten graines, Gum halfe a dragme; beate them all small (except the roots) and make thereof a powder: séeth the rootes in red Wine, and stamp them to grout; then temper the powder amongst it, and put thereto the sirupe of Citron pils and of Orenges, as much as you please, and then let it séeth together againe to a confection. Take euery morning one spoonfull thereof before breakfast. Item, temper the Conserues of Roses with Marmalade, as much as you will: or take either apart. Another. Take prepared Bolus one quarter of an ounce, Conserues of Roses thrée quar∣ters of an ounce, temper and vse thereof euery time one dragme. Or take a whole new layd egge sodden and sugred. A famous Sirupe for heate. TAke Purslaine séed, Lettice seed, and Waterlillies, of each one ounce, prepared Corian∣der, rootes of Waterlillies, of Dandelion, and of Nightshade, of each halfe an ounce, Cam∣fere halfe a dragme, or fiftéene Iuiubes, Dates (eight dayes steeped in vineger and chopt small) two ounces, Rue séeds, mountaine mints, and parched Comin, of each one dragme; séeth these all together in two quarts of water vnto the halfe, then straine it through, being very hard wroong out, put more thereto, twelue ounces of the iuice of Quinces, Sugar six and thirty ounces, and let them séeth all together, and clarifie them. Lastly, cast a little Mints into it, whereof shall be taken two ounces with thrée ounces of Purslaine water, it is very precious and approoued. For this is also good these sirupes following: as De succo Endiuiae, de Cydonijs, de Rosis siccis, Rosatus solutiuus, and Mirtinus. It hath béene also said before, that for this disease no purgations are fit. But if such were most needfull, then is there to be giuen him one ounce, or one ounce and a halfe of fine Cassia with Purslaine water. Another which is stronger: Take Cassia one ounce, and De succo Rosarum one quarter of an ounce, beaten séeds of Agnus castus one scruple, Water∣lillies thrée ounces; temper them all together. Also there is to be giuen him one ounce, or one ounce and a halfe of Cassia with hony or milke. Afterwards take euery morning a draught of well decocted barly water, and temper therewith (according as the heate is great) a spoonful or twaine of the iuice of Housléeke, or Purslaine, for it cooleth much. Item take one ounce, or one ounce and a halfe of Cassia, strew it with the powder of Licorice, and swallow it downe in the morning fasting. Item vse fourtéene dayes continually in the morning early a little Cassia out of the pipes, and spet out the kernels. A Confection that is very fit for this. Take prepared Coriander one quarter of an ounce, powder of Mints thrée dragmes, Lettice, Purslaine, and pilled Cucumber séed, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Gum, Comin, (both parched) of each one dragme, parched Dragagant one dragme and a halfe, Waterlillies one quarter of an ounce, all these beaten small together. Sugar fiftéene ounces, and séeth the Sugar in Purslaine water, and then make Tabulates of it.
Hereafter follow Potions. Take Comfrey rootes and seeth them in water, drinke thereof thrée or foure ounces with Sugar: it is very fit for this disease. Item, steeled water (wherein Mirtle seede hath bene decocted) being drunken, is also very good. For this is also meete Plan∣taine water, Sorrell water, Purslaine water, and Cicorie water. Or take Mallowes and Hol∣lihocke rootes, boyle them in water, and drinke of it. Or take of the Trocisci de Carabe, de terra Sigillata, & de Spodio, which you will, or of each halfe a dragme: for the whole Dose mixe it with whay, and so drinke it. What ought to be vsed outwardly. IF so be that this infirmitie haue long continued, then make Smiths Sinders glowing hot, and slake them in wine, and bath therwithall. You must fill ye Nauel with Stags suet, which stayeth the affluxion of the heate and sharpnesse of the matter. If the patient then desire to make water, thē must the patient hang his priuities in Plātaine water or Nightshade water. Item, take old oyle of Roses two ounces, oyle of Quinces and Mirtles, of each two ounces and a halfe, Burnt Lead, white Lead, Bloudstone (both washt in Lettice water) of each halfe an ounce, Starch one ounce and a halfe, Willow leaues and water Lillie flowers, of each fiue dragmes, Camfere one quarter of an ounce: mixe one with another in a leaden mortar with the iuice of Plantaine, and make also a salue thereof. For this disease shall you finde ma∣ny remedies both in the auncient and later Phisitions. The cooling salue is also very commo∣dious for this; like as is the oyntment of Saunders Ʋnguentum Sandalinum,Vnguentum Sandalinum: which is made in this manner. Take Roses three dragmes, red Saunders two dragmes and a halfe, yellow Saunders one dragme and a half, fine Bolus one quarter of an ounce, burnt Iuorie one drag. Camfere halfe a dragme, white Waxe one ounce, oyle of Rose buds three ounces: the Waxe and the oyle are to be molten togither, and then temper the other things amongst them. This is not onely good for this disease, but also for inflamed Kidneies, and to coole the liuer, the sto∣macke, and all other parts. With any of both these oyntments annoynt the patients Kidneies and the Cods, euen to the end of his Yard. Item, take oyle of Mirtles, Roses, Masticke, of each halfe a dragme, shauen Iuorie one scruple, Camfere two graines: powne all that is to be pow∣ned, and with a little Waxe make thereof a salue, wherwith annoynt the Kidneies. This salue is also good for the whites in women.Womens whites. It is also much commended to weare vpon the Kidneies a peece of thin beaten Lead. Of the Fluxe of Sperme, or the running of Reynes through cold. §. 2. IN this infirmitie is felt with the paine in the head, a distemperance also of the braines, & a vexation af the whole body with cold, euē as in Mania. For this be especially Mints very méete Rue also, and the seede thereof be highly commen∣ded for the same, mountaine Mints, Agnus Castus, Artichockes with the rootes, parched Comin, & Caruway, Annis, Frankinsence, and their barkes, Masticke and Marierom. This patient must then prouidently (as is sayd) and mildly purge, & afterwards euery morning take a dragme of Treacle with Betonie water. You may giue him also stued Peares or Quinces to eate. Likewise rere sodden egges wherein is a little Masticke powder strewed, and red Corall powder. Also the Reynes and bladder are to be an∣nointed round about with oyle of Masticke, and oyle of Roses. Of the Fluxe of the Sperme or seede in the sleepe. §. 3. ABoue the afore mentioned fluxe of the seede, this yet is to be annexed vnto it, when as the seede also passeth away in the sleepe a nights, and very seldome by day. The cause of this is daily riotting and surfetting, and specially meates which are drest with spice, and be easie of digestion. Secondly, the thoughts vp∣on a faire woman whom one loueth. Thirdly, to sléepe sound, and to lye vpon the backe, abundance of bloud, abstinence from women, haile youth, whence all
other signes are to be had and taken, these are also to be remedied like the former. If it be cau∣sed of fulnesse, it is to be cured by abstinence: if through lust after women, then will it be eased with a godly Matrimonie, as also by the vse of cold and dry things, as is already sayd, of the running of the Raynes, of that which procéedeth not of abundance, but maketh a man vnfit to get children, as shall be hereafter spoken of. Of what and whereby naturall Sperme or seede will be most augmented. §. 4. THe cause of the diminishing or increasing of naturall séede may as well procéede of intollerable heate, as cold: also of inward and outward causes. The cold is repercussiue, and kéepeth backe, the heate consumeth. Likewise it may grow by fals, and such like other things moe, whereby the braines are weakened. Item, of some kind of lesion of the stones and other parts, also of inward, as a bad concoction of the séede, cutting of the stone, or the Piles, wherby the gene∣ration of the séede is hindred, of sore precedent diseases, of sorrow, heauinesse, temptation, smal∣nesse of the humaine member, and (amongst diuers other causes) of age also. Now for to helpe this disease (euen as is before sayd) not to increase lecherie or fleshly lust, but in fauour and preferment of Matrimonie. For this therefore is good, warme and dry wea∣ther, and also all such dwellings, yellow Rape séede baked in bread, as much that there be put one scruple in halfe a penyworth of white bread is very requisite: yong fat flesh, not salted too much, a sauce with Saffron, long Pepper, and tayles of Stincus prepared with good Wine: all sowre, sharpe, doughy & slimy meates, must be forborne, long sléepe, and especially after meate doth annoy: for the long sleepe immediatly after meate doth no lesse hinder venerie, then sur∣fetting with meate and drinke. He is also to eschue all vexation, sorrow, and care. But in generall, these things are good for the increase of humaine séede, and to recouer the losse thereof againe, to wit, Egs, Milks, Rise drest in Milke, Sparrowes braines, yea the whole birds. Also the stones of these Beasts following, viz. as of Buls, Cockes, Bucks, Rams, Bores, and all their pissels. Of pottages are very good that of Beanes, Ciches, Lupins: the first bitter brothes of them cast away, and the rest sugred, Pease, Turky, or French Beanes, and Wheate, sodden in fresh broth, and drest with Spice, Annis, Fennell seedes, white and red Mustard séede, Colewort seed, and yellow Rape séede, the seedes of white Sesamum, Fenegreeke séede, sodden with Hony in fat flesh broth, Linséede tempered with Sugar and other meate, and also Nettle séede. Of Rootes these following are highly commended, as stued Onions, Garlick, Léekes, yel∣low Rapes, fresh Ragwort rootes, and confected Sugar, or the powder thereof, dronken with the water wherein Mustard seede is sodden, confected rootes of Eringus, confected Ginger, Costus rootes, Sperage, Thistle rootes, Radish, Zeduary, Squils rosted, confected Asarabacca, Piere∣trum, and Cypers nuts. Of Herbes, are the garden Cressis, and braunches of Sperage. Of Fruits, hasell Nuts, Pistacia, Almonds, and aboue all, Marchpane made thereof. All Spices are very commodious for this vse, as Cinnamom, Cardamome, Galingall, long Pepper, Cloues, Ginger, & Saffron. For this is also very highly praysed Assa foetida, the waight of one dragme and a halfe dronken in good Wine: in like manner also Dragagant, the pissell of a Bull, or of a Hart, the waight of one scruple taken also in Wine; likewise the tayles of Stincus the waight of a dragme, taken before meate with Wine. Of things compounded you haue these confections, Diamoschu, Pliris, Aromaticum Rosatum, Diambra, Dianthos, Diagalanga, Trionpipereon, and Diamargaritan Calidum: also Mithridate in like manner. And aboue all other things is the confection Diasatyrion commended, for it strengtheneth the stomacke. This following is much vsed at Augusta: Take Ginger one dragme and a halfe, Almonds, Pingles, and Pisticia, of each one ounce, the kernels of an Indy Nut, and Sisarum, of each halfe an ounce, the pissell of a Hart fiue dragmes, Cynqfoyle, Palma Christi one dragme and a halfe, Galingall, Cloues, Cinnamom, white Mustard séede, long Pepper, wild yellow Rape séede, white Behen, of each one dragme, Onion séede, Radish séed, Rape seede, and Ashen keyes, of each two scruples, the sides and tayles of Stincus thrée drag.

Also take clarified Hony, three ounces to one ounce of the powder, then make thereof a confection. Of the same may three dragmes be taken at once, tempered with Sugar pennets and new Milke. One may vse outwardly Waxe made to an Oyntment, with oyle of Beuercod. Or take Beuercod, Marierom gentle, oyle of Costus, of each a like much, put thereto a little Muske or Zibeta, and therwith annoynt the yarde, with other places adioyning vnto it. If you will haue a slighter, then take the gall of a Beare. An especiall oyntmēt: Take of the great winged Ants thrée dragmes, oile of white Sasamum, and oyle of Lillies, of each one ounce, powne the Ants and put them into the oyle, and so let them stand the space of sixe dayes in the Sunne: afterwards wring out the oyle, and put thereto Euphorbium one scruple, Pepper & Rue, of each one dragme, white Mustard seede half a dragme: set this againe into the Sunne awhile, and annoynt all ouer the priuities therewith. Another. Take oyle of Lillies two ounces, oyle of Beuercod one ounce, Euphorbium, Pepper, white Mustard séed, of each one dragme, Muscus halfe a scruple: temper it vnto an Oyntment. If so be that then the naturall heate be thereby excitated and stirred vp, and other kindnesse do come vpon you, then do what in you lyeth. The seuenth Chapter. Of Barrennesse in generall. WHen as then neither in the one nor in ye other, as that neither in the Man nor in the Woman, there appeareth any infirmitie in the parts of gene∣ration, and both parties are mighty inough for the worke, notwithstan∣ding cannot come to any generation, then must there be a certaine cause of barrennesse, whereof there be many kinds. First then concerning the Man, it may be well caused through outward and inward accidents: the outward are the hard meates, whereto there commeth then also the vn∣beliefe of Withcraft. But if so be that the same proceed of inward causes, then doth the same procéed of the weaknesse of the most principall parts of mans body, as of the Hart, the Braines, the Liuer, the Stomacke, & the Milt. Or he may be too fat, or too leane, with many moe other infirmities, which may be in the priuy mēbers, that are not to be here discoue∣red. The signes of the Barrennesse of the man are these, great heate, which may be knowen by féeling him. The woman in receiuing féeleth the great heate of the seede, he hath great desire to the action, and is very hairy ouer al his body, and got haire very early about the priuities: But if so be that cold be the cause, then are these things found to be all contrary. Concerning the Women, the Barrennesse may be caused by drinking too much cold water, by continuall vse of sowre meates, by anger, by feare, by frighting, and other motions moe of the minde which may cause all the same. Item, when a woman after copulation stirreth by and by, leapeth, runneth, or daunceth too much. If it proceede of any inward cause, then must it be either of the constitution of the whole body, or of some other infirmitie of the parts of genera∣tion. If of the constitution of the whole body, then shall some principal part of the body féele the same, to wit, by reason that the Termes are hindred, or flow too much. Also a woman may be too old, or too yong, or too fat, which maketh barren. If the maladie be in the parts of generation, then dependeth it most in the mother or wombe, which hath some vlceration, or is too wide or too narrow, or too much obstructed, and such like. The signes of Barrennesse in women are these, to wit, when it procéedeth of the coldnesse of the mother, then hath she her Termes very little, and if they do runne, yet are they not well co∣loured: they haue also but little haire on their priuities, they be by nature slow and slacke, they care not much for men, and are commonly of a pale colour, for which doth also much helpe the long vse of meates or drinkes which are cold of nature. If the Barrennes be caused through heate, then hath she likewise her floures or termes very little, mixt with yellownesse, the woman is hasty headed, crafty, thirsty, desirous of the man,
hairie about her priuie place, she hath a quick pulse, and black haire, with other tokens moe, all which dry or moyst diseases must néedes be in the mother, or in the necke of the same. Thirdly, they are sometimes of a contrary complexion, for that the séede cannot be rightly mixed, or sometime also too neare like one another of complexion: For an example, when a cold man commeth to a cold woman, or that they be both dry of nature: and if in all things else they be also of like complexions one to another, then is it vnpossible that the woman can con∣ceiue. There shall be moe other signes described how to know by whom the let and infirmitie commeth, to wit, do cast both Spermata vpon the water, and that which driueth on the top, is barren. Item, sprinkle both their vrines vpon a Lettice leafe, and whosoeuer doth dye away first, the same is vnfruitfull. Or take fiue cornes of Wheate, seuen Barley graines, and seuen Beanes, put them all into an earthen pot, and pisse thereon, let it stand so seuen dayes long, and if they begin to sprout, then is the person fruitfull, or if they rot, then is he or she barren, be it man or woman. Or let him pisse in a pot, and let the vrine stand awhile, if wormes grow therein, then is that vrine barren. These three last proofes do the auncient Phisitions themselues say to be vncer∣taine, therefore we will let them rest. Item, make vnderneath an odoriferous fume, as of Myrrhe, red Storax, and such like odo∣riferous warme things to passe into the necke of the wombe, through a tunnell, which being close couered round about, if the woman finde that this smoke go through the body, and feeleth it in her nose, then is she fruitfull. Another. Take grosse beaten Garlick, and lay the woman with her backe thereupon, if so be that she féele the smell in her nose, then is it a token of fruitfulnesse. There are moe such like to∣kens which are sayd to be approoued: but how that fruitfulnesse is to be furthered and holpen, there are diuers remedies hereafter rehearsed out of the writings of the most famous Phisi∣tions, out of which may be chosen according to the complexion of women, whether they be hote, cold, moyst, dry, fat, leane, oppilated, or contrary by nature. For to helpe and preferre or hasten fruitfulnesse. §. 1. IF that fruitfulnesse be desired to be furthered and holpen, then must the cause that hindreth the same be abated and taken away, of which the learned do recken very many, which may be contained in thrée especiall points, as when a woman is to hote, and too dry, too cold, and too moyst, or hath her termes or floures too much or to little, of which thrée especiall points we will now discourse. Of Barrennesse through heate. §. 2. ALl such women must beware of hote ayre, dwellings, and such like: also of clothes which kéepe the parts and sinewes about the wombe too hote. Also they must eschue all hote meates, as Spice, salt flesh, strong Wine, very fat meates, warme herbs, as Smallage, Fennel, Thyme, Southernewood, Rue, long wat∣ching, to lye much on the Raynes or Kidneis, great labour, anger, heauinesse, and such like motions of the minde: but all that moderately cooleth that must be vsed. They must take oftentimes conserue of Roses, or cold Dragagant losinges, and the confe∣ctions Triasantali, also to hold before the nose and smell to Campher, Rose water, and Saun∣ders, as hath bene many times told for hote sicknesses. Aboue all these, must the Basilica or Liuer veine be opened in the right arme, and to let out a∣bout fiue ounces of bloud. On the next day is this purgation to be vsed: Take Elect. de Epithi∣mo, de succo Rosarum, of each two dragmes and a halfe, the whay of Milke foure ounces, tem∣per them well togither, and take it in the morning, then sléepe afterwards about one houre and a halfe, and fast foure houres vpon it: this being done, drinke a good draught of whay, and you may breake your fast one houre after. Other do purge with Triphera Saracenica, and Rubarb, and also minister preparatiue potions mixed either with sirupes of Violets, Roses, or Endiue. Or take the water of water Lillies foure ounces, water of Mandragora one ounce, beaten
Saffron halfe a scruple: drinke them luke warme, and do this eight dayes one after ano∣ther. Also you may vse these pils following: Take Broome flowers, Smallage, Parsley séede Co∣min, Mugwort, and Feuerfew, of each halfe a scruple, Aloe halfe an ounce, Indy salt and Saf∣fron, of each halfe a dragme, powne them all togither and mixe them well; afterwards powre thereon fiue ounces of warme Feuerfew water: close it to, and let it stand and dry in a warme place: do this thrée times one after another. This being all done, then make sixe pils of each dragme, and take alwayes one thereof before supper about the second day, all the while that this foresayd Potion is vsed, afterwards you must take one thereof about the third or fourth day, vntill that she haue conceiued. After the foresayd Potions must this purgation following be vsed: Take the conserue Benedicta lax: one quarter of ounce, de Psillio thrée dragmes, Electua∣rium de succo Rosarum one dragme and a halfe; temper them togither with Feuerfew water, and drinke it warme in the morning early: thrée dayes after this purgation must the Median veine be opened in the right foote, to wit, fiue or sixe houres after breakefast, and according to her strength must be letten out fiue or sixe ounces of bloud, the next day, and also fiue dayes one after another filed Iuorie is to be taken, one dragme and a halfe with Feuerfew water. And the whilest that this Potion is by her vsed, then is she in the morning one houre before that she do arise, and also at night before she go to bed, to sit in this bath following, and remaine there∣in about halfe an houre. Take wild yellow Rapes, Daucus, Balsam wood with the fruits, and the séede or keyes of an ash trée, of each two handfuls, red and white Behen, & Broome flowers, of each a handfull and a halfe, Muske thrée graines, Amber, Saffron, of each one scruple, séeth all these in sufficient wa∣ter. But the Saffron, Muske, Amber and Broome flowers must be put into it when all the rest be sufficiently decocted and wrong out. A profitable Confection. Take Pistacia, Pingles, Eringus, of each half an ounce, of the swéet rootes which the Italians do call Dolcegine asmuch also, of Saffron one dragme, Lignum Aloes, Galingall, Mace, Gariophilata, red and white Behen, and Baulme flowers, of each foure scrup. shauen Iuorie & Cassia rindes, of each two scruples, sirupe of confected Ginger twelue ounces, white Sugar sixe ounces: seeth these well togither with the sirupe in twelue ounces of Baulme water vntill it be all decocted: when it is cold, then put the rest amongst it, and stirre it well to∣gither: Lastly mixe Muske, and Amber amongst it, of each half a scruple. Hereof must a woman take thrice a day, to wit, in the morning, one houre before noone, and one houre after supper, euery time the quantitie of a Nutmeg, and that especially after purging and bathing. This confection is rather a strengthening and warming medicine than cooling; and is specially to be vsed when it is perceiued that the flegme and slime be approching. For Barrennesse through drought. §. 3. FOr this must be eschewed all that which is hot, for that hot things consume the naturall moysture too soone; notwithstanding their meate and drinke must be méetly warme, as Barley and Oten paps, Pullets, and small hard fishes. For this is to be vsed small Clisters: as the broth of Lambes heads, and common herbes which do moysten: to wit, Violet leaues, and such like: Pessaries of Hol∣lihocke rootes fattened with fresh Butter, and so put into the necke of the Wombe. Goats milke and such like, that do fatten and moysten, are very commodious for this purpose. In like manner also Almonds and Pingles, which not onely through their fattening withstand the drouth, but also do strengthen all the sinewes. Of Barrennesse through fatnesse. §. 4. THe great fatnesse is no small cause of Barrennesse: therefore are all such women to leade and obserue such a rule of life, whereby the superfluous fatnesse may be consumed, whereof in the first Part you shall haue an especiall Chapter. But for a generall obseruation, they must not sléepe much, & chiefly by day. Also they must forbeare all baths, except such as be warme of themselues. For this is also good a
dry swéete bath very commodious and profitable. To purge often is also good for this. Item strong Clisters which warme and dry, and other things moe which hereafter shall be described. Of Barrennesse through cold and moysture. §. 5. A Woman which is cold and moyst, méetely strong exercise is very good for her, except it be then, when she hath accompanied with her husband: after which time she ought to rest two houres at the least. Also she is not to be ouercharged with any meate: but rather to refraine alwayes with appetite. Much sleepe, sorrow, anger, &c. she must beware of. To eate much fish is hurtfull vnto her, Milke, fresh Cheese, and all that is made of dough; Béetes, Lettice, Spinage, Endiue, Purslaine, Cherries, Hasell nuts, Garlicke, Onions and such like, are not meete for her: fat flesh, much broth and Vineger must she refraine: for they be hurtfull for the Wombe. There is therein specially to be considered, how to cleanse the wombe from all excessiue moysture; for which are to be vsed some preparatiue potions of Oxymel of Squils, or at the least of Oxymel Composito, and sirupe of Wormwood, with a decoction of Annis, Fennel, Comin, Cus∣cuta, and Harts tongue. And then to take thereupon Pil. Benedictae one dragme once euery fourtéene dayes, and then to fast fiue houres after them. Secondly, take Styrax Calaminta, field Mints, Asphalathus, Ameos Seseli, Rue, Balsam wood and the fruits, red and white Behen, of each halfe an ounce, make a bath thereof, and let her sit in it euen to the Nauell. In the meane time no delay must be in annointing the places adioyning about the wombe, with warming and drying oyles; as oyle of Spike, oyle of Elder, and such like. Also this Confection is to be vsed: Take Cinnamom, Cardamom, Saffron, Cloues, Mace, long pepper, Cypers roots, Nutmegs, Comin, Lignum Aloes, and Cassia wood, of each one scrup. Cucubes and Doronicum, of each foure scruples, Muske, Amber, & Balsam, one dragme, white Sugar eightéen ounces, Malmesey, Buglosse water, and of Balme, as much as is néedfull for to séeth the Sugar, then make a Confection; whereof she is euery euening to take a spoonefull when she goeth to bed, also halfe so much before supper. Another. Take yellow Rape séede, Pease, and scraped Iuorie, of each one quarter of an ounce, Nettle seede, Ameos, Sesel, Indy Spica, Cardamome, Blatta Byzantia, Bay berries, Nut∣megs, Cypers nuts, Hyssope, Marierom, Spikenard, and Cypers rootes, of each one dragme, white, blacke, and long Pepper, halfe an ounce togither; Ginger and Cinnamom, of each one ounce, this being all stampt and mixed togither make with hony a Confection thereof, and last∣ly temper therewith two or thrée graines of Muske. All the foresayd things are speciall good to consume the windes of the wombe. Now for this purpose followeth here certaine simples and compounded medicines; as Annis, Fennell, Ca∣raway, Smallage seede, and Rue séede, each vsed alone. In like sort, Marierom, Agnus Castus, flowers and séedes, Comin, prepared Spikenard séede, Bayberries, Rue, the Tabulats of Dia∣cumino, and Aniso, that do altogither consume moysture. For to fume or to foment are specially commended these things following, Rue, Carni, Ameos and Gallia muscata. Item, take Galliam Muscatam, Bdellium, Beuercod, Laudanum, Hares grease, and Nutmegs, of each halfe an ounce, let these séeth all togither in water, and wash or foment therewith. This following clenseth and also warmeth well the Wombe, and drieth the moysture of the same: Take Coloquint beaten grosse one quarter of an ounce, Cinnamome thrée dragmes, temper them with good wine, or with oyle of Spike, dip Cotton therein, and put the same into the necke of the wombe. Item take Swines bread, forme thereof a Pessarie of the bignes of a Date stone, & women must put this into their priuy places, being fastened to a thréed: it is passing good. They may al∣so lay this plaister following vnder their nauel being cut round. Take ye plaister called Cerane∣um two ounces, Laudanum one ounce and a halfe, Galliae & Aliptae muscatae, of each halfe an ounce; temper them with oyle of Spike, and spread it on a round leather, and vse it as is aforesayd. For to dry and correct a slimy and moyst Wombe this following is to be vsed. Take Sil∣uer mountaine, red and white Behen, Ashe keyes, shauen Iuory, yellow and wild Rape séede,

Cinnamom, Mace, Cloues, Galingall, long Pepper, Rosemarie flowers, Bal∣sam wood, Blattae Byzantiae, Maierom gentle, and Penniroyal, of each foure scruples, Balme, Bu∣glosse, Citron peeles, of each two scruples, Pearles one scruple, Muske two graines, white Su∣gar foure and twenty ounces, séeth the same with Malmsey, and make therof a confection. This confection is very good and approued for all that is aforesaid, and also for fruitfulnesse. For to comfort the retentiue vertue of the wombe. §. 6. IF so be that there be any infirmitie in the retentiue vertue of the wombe, which doth commonly happen through ouer coldnes, for the which are strengthening and warming things to be vsed, as Amber, Frankinsence, with their rinds, Ma∣sticke, Lignum Aloes, Cloues, Nutmegs, Sage, Galingall, Calmus and Cardo∣mome. Also she must be gouerned like as hath bene sayd in the discourse of bar∣rennesse. Item, there is more good for this, that the necke of the matrix be often washed with water wherein Cypers rootes are decocted: or with water wherein Iron drosse is sodden, which is stronger. Also for this may serue Masticke strewed vpon hot coales, and the fume thereof receiued from below. A very good salue fit for this: Take the iuice of Roses, of Pomegranates and Cloues, of each one ounce, Frankinsence, Hypocistis, the iuice of Sloes, Mastick, prepared Coriander, and Iron drosse, of each one drag. Sealed earth and Starch, of each one ounce, bruse these very long in a Leaden mortar, and annoint the priuities therewith oftentimes. But if the infirmitie procéede of heate, then are things to be vsed which be astringent, roborating and cooling, yet tempered with some warme things. The cold things are these, burnt and washt Harts horne, Amber, iuice of Sloes, Hypocistis, burnt Muskle shels: Bolus, burnt Gals, Dragon bloud, Sealed earth, flowers and shales of Pomegranates, Acornes with their cups, the rind of the Medlar trée and the fruits, Seruices and Mirtle séede, of all these foresayd simples may salues, plaisters, and o∣ther things be prepared, which are all fit for this infirmitie. Of Barrennesse through repletion of the body, and obstruction of the Termes or Flowers. §. 7. THese women must forbeare all slimy meates, as milke and all that is drest there∣with, also from all doughie meates, pottage and old fish, vnleauened bread, new Chéese (but old Cheese is meetely tollerable) from all cold and moyst fruits. Tou∣ching all other meates, they may liue according to their old custome: their drinke must be reasonable or meane strong white wine. Concerning the medicines, you must first begin with the letting of bloud, opening the Basili∣ca in the right arme, and to let out foure or fiue ounces of bloud. The next day following you may cause to be mixt togither Pillulae de Opopanaco, and of Hiera Composita, of each halfe a dragme, and to make seuen pils thereof, and to take them in the mor∣ning, and then to sléepe one houre and a halfe vpon it, and fiue houres after to drinke a draught of sugred water, and then one houre after that to eate. This being done, this powder following is to be prepared, and to be vsed foure graines therof euery mealetide in all their meats. Take Cinnamome halfe an ounce, Saffron one drag. Spikenard two scruples, Licorice foure scrup. whereof make a subtile powder. Immediatly after the pils, they are to vse this potion sixe or eight dayes continually early in the morning: Take Syrupum Acetosum compositum, De Eupatorio, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Mugwoort, Feuerfew, and the water of Elecampane rootes, of each one ounce, temper them togither. Or take the foresayd waters alone without sirupes fiue ounces at one time. Other pils: Take Aloe two ounces, Agaricus, and Opopanacum, of each one drag. and a halfe, Spica, Mather, Cinnamome, Saffron and Indie Salt, of each one drag. Coloquint foure scrup. the iuice of Feuerfew foure ounces, temper all togither, and set it in the sunne, and stir it often about vntill it be dry, do this thrice. Then take the waight of a dragme, and forme sixe pils thereof, & vse one euery thrée dayes iust before supper. Also likewise one in the day time, so long as they vse these foresayd potions: but not when they purge. The said purgation must be made thus: Take Electuarium Indum halfe an ounce, de Succo Rosarum one drag. temper this with thrée
ounces of water of Elecampane rootes. After this second purgation, she is one moneth long to take the waters of Feuerfew, Ele∣campane rootes and Balme, of each one ounce mixed togither, before noone and against night she is to sit in this bath following: Take Balme, Maierom gentle, white Mints, Penniroyall, Feuerfew, and Mugwort, of each a handfull, small and great Camedrios, Spica romana, Daucus, Agrimonie and Stechas, of each a handfull, séeth these all togither in sufficiēt water, vntill that about the third part be sodden away, and then put thereto Muske three graines, Lignum Aloes, Galliae Muscatae beaten small, of each a dragme. This being so prepared, then shall the set her self therein, and kéepe her selfe from her husband thrée dayes. In the meane while, she is to put into the necke of the wombe this pessarie following: Take Saffron half a scruple, Muske, Amber, Lignum Aloes, and Ash keyes, of each thrée graines, Hares renning, as much as is néedfull; forme it like to Date stones, and she is to weare it all the day in her body. Another: Take Hares renning one dragme and a halfe, shauen Iuorie, red and white Be∣hen, and Ash keyes, of each halfe a dragme, Sesely, Penniroyall, Nep, Sauine, Galliae Muscatae, of each halfe a scruple, being all beaten small and tempered with oyle of Spike vntill it be soft; then temper therewith Muske and Laudanum, of each two graines, dip some wooll therein, and vse it as before. For the poore is onely the oyle of Lillies commended with a pessarie of Cotton dipped there∣in, and so put vp and holden therein the space of thrée houres. When such women haue purged and bathed, then must they, before that they come at their husbands, be let bloud in the Saphena or Median, two houres after supper, letting out thrée or foure ounces of bloud, if so be that she be any thing strong. It were also very good that whē such women arise a mornings, they do gird about them a lōg garment, and set some fire vnder them, and to strew therin this powder following, that she may receiue the vapour thereof, and vse a little at once. A very good confection: Take Doronicum, Ash keyes, Mugwort, Feuerfew, flowers of S. Iohns woort, of each one dragme, Balme, Basill, of each one quarter of an ounce, shauen Iuory halfe an ounce, Amber one scruple, Muske fiue graines, small filed Gold halfe a dragme, the powder called Nere one dragme, Syrup. de Calaminta thrée ounces, Sirupe of Citron péeles fiue ounces, Sugar sixe ounces, all that is to be powned powne small, séeth the Sirupe and Sugar méetely thicke: and when it beginneth to be cold, then temper it with all the powder (except the Spec. Nere, Muske and Amber) the which must be put in at the last. Kéepe this confection in a Gally pot, whereof the woman is to take immediately after her second letting bloud, euery morning the quantitie of a Nutmeg, and fast foure houres after. In like manner also after meate the bignesse of a Beane, and drinke thereupon a draught of good wine; the which hath holpen many women. The powder before promised for suffumigation. Take Laudanum halfe an ounce, Galliae Mus∣catae two dragmes, Muske, Amber, of each thrée graines, Lignum Aloes, Opopanacum, of each one dragme, make them into powder, and vse a little of it one time. For to further the fruitfulnesse in man and woman. §. 8. TAke Rapes, Sisarum, shauen Iuorie, Sesely, red and white Behen, Ash keyes, of each one drag. Cinnamome, Doronicum, Mace, Cloues, Galingale, long Pepper, Rosemarie flow∣ers, Balsam wood, Blattae Byzantiae, Marierom gentle, Penniroyall, of each two scruples, Balme, Buglosse, Citron peeles, of each one scruple, Indie Spike, Amber, Perles, of each halfe a scrup. Sugar decocted in Malmsey one pound, make Tabulats thereof or a Confection. A powder for to strew vpon the meate: Take Nutmegs, Cucubes and Ginger, of each halfe a drag. long Pepper, Masticke, Cinnamome, red and white Behen, of each one scruple, stampe them togither, and so vse them as is sayd. Item, take the stone of a Bore hog being two yeares old, & the pissell of a Stag shauen small halfe an ounce, foure paire of Foxe stones, and fiftie or threescore Sparrowes braines, wild yellow Rapes, Eringus rootes, Satyrion, confected all togither in Sugar & shauen Iuorie, of each thrée ounces and a halfe, Cinnamome, the pissell of a Bull, Pingles, Dates, and Indy Nut ker∣nels,

Another. Take clarified hony thrée ounces, Linseed, Greines, and shauen Iuory, of each one ounce, Burrage thrée ounces, make thereof a confection, and temper therewith 24. ounces of su∣gar, Muske and Amber, of each halfe a scruple, Cinnamome two graines, Cloues and Mace, of each one graine, it is a very mild medicine. It is also very good that men and women receiue euery morning a little Treacle, to wit, half a dragme, with halfe a dragme of shauen Iuory; but for such as be yong, it is not so good by rea∣son of the heate. A good salue. Take Galliae Muscatae, Nutmegs, Beuercod, Hares renning, Laudanum, of each one quarter of an ounce, oile of Spike, oile of Masticke and of Mirtles, of each thrée dragmes, Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make a salue therewith: these are to be vsed as the other. Wine of Rosemary is also much commended for this. In like maner the Morolfe wine: all which are described in the last part, with other moe such spiced Wines, which are very fit for such ouercold and barren men and women. For to make a woman fruitfull, for which this serueth for a potion & bath following: Take Wormewood and Mugwort, of each a handfull, séeth them together in a quart of Goates milke almost to the halfe, whereof euery morning and euening she is to take a good draught. For to bathe: Take wild Penniroyall, Mugwort and Rue, of each one handfull; make a bag thereof, and let them séeth in raine water: bathe therein euery eight houres, and alwaies about the third day a fresh bath. For a conclusion, in women is (as it is already said) the greatest cause of barrennes, for that the Matrix or Womb is not cleane, is ouercooled, or hath some other infirmity, whereof hereaf∣ter in this part shall be discoursed and taught, also what is meete and fit for the same. The eight Chapter. Of the Raines and their paines. EVen as we haue described now the outward parts before of the belly in this third part of our booke of Phisicke, so doth the cause require that we ought to write somewhat of the hinder part, amongst which the Raines are comprehended: and that these raines are a part of the back, it appée∣reth by all that here before in the second part in the fourth chapter, and also afterwards is written, therefore it is thought néedlesse to make any further mention thereof. These Raines do suffer by reason of the Kidneys very great paine, whē the same are vexed with heate, vlceration, grauel, stone, or other malady, the description whereof yet hereafter followeth in this third part, where it may also be noted and obserued what may be good & commodious for the same. There be commonly commended for hot paines in the raines oile of Roses, Violets, and yellow violets, Waterlillies, and Poplar buds, in like sort also thrée salues following, of Saunders, the cooling ointment of Galeni, and the Poplar salue are very good, and that in all hot causes. But if the paine procéed of cold, then is Honywater to be drunken, & confected roots of Eryngus, Fennell, Comin, Caraway, be it confected or otherwise, are to be eaten, for they asswage much the paine. Some vse also the conserues of Piony. This salue following is especiall good: Take blew and yellow Violets, of each one ounce and a halfe, oyle of swéete Almonds, of Sesamum, of each one dragme and a halfe, fresh butter one ounce, Saffron one scruple, white Waxe one ounce and a halfe, Ducks grease, oile of Cam∣momill, oyle of Dill, of each one quarter of an ounce, and a small yolke of an Egge, the oyle, grease, and butter melt together, and at the last put the Saffron and yolke vnto it, and stirre it
well about, it swageth much the paine which is caused through the grauel, stone, and any thing else, therefore it is called by the Grecians Onodynum, euen as the Apothecaries do call it vnto this day Ʋnguentum Anodynum. The ninth Chapter. Of the Buttockes. THere are two Buttocks giuen to men for their vse, by nature compiled of a compact, fast, muscly, and hard flesh: and not narrow piked, bearing vp like to Beasts, but prety and round, as well for a comelinesse of the same place, as for to sit on, and ease the whole body, couering and de∣fending the fundament, that the same cannot be violated nor strained through sitting. These foresaid buttocks do seldome suffer any other in∣firmity, but such as be subiect to Chirurgery, as wounds, vlcerations, fistulaes, Cankers, and such like. Besides this, is no more to be spoken thereof: therfore we wil passe ouer to the Fundament or outward part of the Arsegut, with his infirmities, which are incident vnto it outwardly and inwardly. The tenth Chapter. Of the Arsegut or Fundament in generall. THere haue bin some dotrels in the world, who haue complained of nature, wherfore she had not chosen as wel a bone or some other neather member of the body, wherby she might expel ye excremēts, as she did this mild place of the body; which grosse speech is to be scorned as a great folly: for how could she haue ordained a closer, fitter & handsomer place thā this? Concer∣ning then this Arsgut, it is a conueier of all excrements, long & wide; and whereas it cometh to our sight with a round circle, it is there shapen of a muscly & sinewy substance, (like as are the lips of the mouth) therfore hath it also such power that it openeth like a purse, & shutteth fast again, that it might not receiue any wind or any thing else. Vnto these priuy places do there come sundry accidents, amongst which the most manifest is, when this gut doth fal out of ye body, therfore we wil first of al write therof. Of the going out or hanging downe of the Arse-gut, Procidentia Ani. §. 1. THis may be caused by two maner of meanes, to wit, when the Muscles and La∣certs, which do open & shut this gut with two sinewes (which presently deuide themselues into two parts) do giue & relent through some falling downe of hu∣mors, or thrust the same out through some impostume. Of the said sinewes, that which openeth the Arsgut is outward, and that which shutteth the same inward. If so be then (as it is said) that any of these sinewes be too sore feebled or slacked through any humors, then followeth immediatly the Procidentia, or hanging out of the Arsgut. The signes that this is hapned through some resolution of the sinewes, are, yt it may easily with∣out paine be brought again into the body; like as contrariwise if there be any impostume with it, then wil it not be done without griefe. Also there is alwaies a hardnes with it, & an apparant di∣stemperature. Now for to remedy this, cause first that the patient may haue his going natu∣rally to the stoole, that he be not suddenly forced for to open the gut. But if there be no swelling with it, and that you haue no other thing néere hand which is fit for it, then let the patient sit in common warme water. Otherwise it may be made stronger as thus: Take Acorne cups, Gall nuts, flowers of Pomegranats, and Mirtle leaues, seeth them together in water vntil it be a li∣tle red, and sit therein. The same do Cipers nuts alone, or the iuice of Sloes, wherin Mirtle séed and the seeds of Ʋerbascum are decocted. After this bath, then foment the dependant gut with
warme oyle of Roses, and afterwards strew this powder thereon: Take white led, blossoms of Pomegranats, Antimony, and Allume, of each a like much, make thereof a subtill powder. Item take Butchers broome halfe an ounce, Gals, the yellow séeds of Roses, Cipers nuts, Myrrhe and Frankinsence, of each one dragme, beate them to powder, and vse them as afore∣said. Another. Burne Dates to powder, and strew that powder thereon, as is said. Or take Mumia, Lycium, Hypocistis, and beaten Gals, of each two scruples, burnt Oistershels two drag. and a halfe, and vse it as before. This following is also very good for this: Take Hypocistis, Ma∣sticke and Myrrhe, of each one dragme, beate it méetly small: first annoint the gut with oyle of Masticke and Roses, strew it then with this said powder: this being done, thrust it softly into the body, lay a cloth thereon wetted in grosse wine, and it is good to put a little Sandaraca vn∣to it. It is also very good to annoint the place oftentimes with stéeled wine for the same: and in like maner Sauine dried, beaten, and strewed vpon it. Item, after the annointing with oile, annoint the gut with the iuice of Sloes: when as then through any superfluity of humors this gut doth fall downe in children, then take Myrrhe one dragme and a half, oile of Roses one ounce, annoint it therewith, and then put it vp again softly into the body. This Procidentia Ani, or falling downe of the Arsegut, hapneth for the most part in the Piles with an excrescence of flesh, the which the Grecians do call Condyloma: for which Parietaria is ve∣ry good layd often vpon it, whereof we will write more at large hereafter. Of the relaxation or slacking of the Arsegut. §. 2. THis disease doth manifest it self sometimes through the first recited falling downe of the Arsegut, and otherwhiles without the same, & is such an infirmity (as hath bin told already) that the sinewes which do shut it are become altogether with∣out might, insensible and lame, insomuch that he cannot perceiue his Ordure, and doth it without any sense or féeling: also oft times so contracted and made so sense∣les, that it holdeth vp and stayeth the Ordure altogether, wherby cometh gripings in the belly, and other great inconueniences. The causes of this, are somtimes fals, thrusts or blowes behind on the back, and especially on the place whence the sinewes haue their ofspring, whereby the power of the opening and shutting of the Arsegut is infeebled. In like manner when any body hath the Piles opened, whereby the Piles are in that place spoyled. This infirmity may also be caused by sitting too long on cold stones, and by suffering too much cold in the feete. But if this disease do come through cutting, or any other bruising of the sinewes, then are all remedies in vaine. If it come through cold, which taketh away all motion, then is the place to be kept alwayes warme: for which this bath following is very good, which is thus prepared: Take Cipers nuts and the leaues, Mints, Sauine, Costus rootes, Sage, Bay berries, rindes of the Pine trée and the leaues, of each one handfull; séeth them all together in a good quantity of water, so that the sick person may sit therein; when he hath béene bathed, then lay a péece of felt in this water, and lay it to the patients Arsegut: he must vse this bath twice in foure and twenty houres, it warmeth and strengtheneth the sinewes of the Arsegut. Also he must séeth therewith Rue, Scenanthe, Allume, garden Mints, field Mints: and if it wil not alter therewith, then vse these clisters following: Take sixe ounces of this foresaid decoction, and oyle of Spike two ounces, and mixe them together: and annoint the Arsegut outwardly, and all other places adiacent with oile of Lillies, Beuercod, and of Euphorbium, tempered all to∣gether, or vsed each apart. If there be any flegmatick moisture with it, then put vnto it halfe an ounce or thrée quarters of Hiera Picra: if that there be heate with it, let the patient after the vse of all necessary medicines take a bath of water, wherein hath bin decocted the rinds of the Medlar trée and the leaues, the rinds of Oke, Seruices, Pomegranate rinds and blossomes, Chestnut shales, or those that may be gotten of them, yet alwayes putting some warming things vnto it. For this is also especiall good all naturall bathes, which are Sulphurish, Allumish, yea there is also good for this Sea water or salt water.
Of the Impostume of the Arsegut. §. 3. IF there happen then any vlcer or impostume in the Arsegut, whereby one can not get it into the body, and the same is caused through heate, there is nothing more fit than to open a veine, and afterwards to prouoke vomit, whereby the matter may be deriued: but for this is no purging good, and especially because the disease is in the fundament, but lay this following thereon: Take peeled Lentils thrée ounces, Roses and the iuice of Sloes, of each one ounce, the iuice of Nightshade thrée ounces, beaten Hollihock rootes, Figs cut, Linséed and Fenegreeke beaten small, as much as you thinke good: let this séeth all to pap, and at the last temper therewith thrée or foure yolks of Egs, and as much Butter as you thinke good, and lay it warme vpon the place where the paine is. If so be then this be caused through cold, then put vnto it a litle of the rootes of Lillies, Cammomill, Melilot, and such like. And if so be that this Arsegut by reason of the impostume, will hardly be put vp againe into the body, then must the patient be set often∣times in warme water, and afterwards annoint the Arsegut with oile of Cammomill and of Dill, which are molten with a little Waxe; this swageth the paine. In like sort also descendeth the neck of the Matrix in women, and is in such sort to be cured, like as hereafterwards amongst other infirmities of the wombe shall be written more at large. Of the Piles called Haemorrhoides. §. 4. AFter the foresaid falling downe of the Arsegut, there commeth one disease more in the fundament, the which we call the Piles, and the Grecians Haemorrhoides, which is a fluxe of blood; and Sycoses, that are Figs, which the Latinists do call Ficus, Figs, and Mariscas. All these are Accidents and Tumors, which do come behind in the Fundament, or in the lowermost part of the Arsegut. And they do appeare by their swelling, and otherwise (whereof they get their name) sometimes with blood, and otherwhiles without blood, but seldome without paine, but vexeth folkes with great trouble. They take their beginning from some small veines, which spread themselues into the vttermost parts of the stomack, and are thereof called the Pile or Emroyd veines. When as these be then ouercharged with blood, or any other humors, then do they open themselues, and expel the melancholick blood from them sometimes in great quantity, whereby nature is much vnburthened, and getteth great health; therefore it is often commaunded for to open the same, euen as hereafter shall be admonished: also they bléed otherwhiles so exces∣siuely, that great trauell is taken before they can be stopped, wherof we shall speake hereafter. There be also some of these veines which lie somewhat deepe vpwards, and therefore are called the blind Piles. These Piles are properly the Hemorrhoides, like as by their name may appeare. Others be without blood, of the which, they that make shew outwardly on the Arsegut are first of all the Figpiles, by reason that in their whole substance and quantity they be like vnto figs, and also are therfore called Verrucales, the which are much worse than the other, whose cause is only me∣lancholick blood. Other do shew themselues like to a black ripe grape, so that they be called Ʋna∣les, which haue their matter from blood mingled with melancholy. The third are like to Mulbe∣ries, red and blackish coloured, wherein the blood doth apparantly excéed. The fourth kind is like to the bladder of a fish, which is extended very much without blood, filled or stuft with melancholick humors; but these sorts are seldome séene. The first sort are the secret Piles, which do come within the Arsegut, and be very hurtfull, especially those which ex∣tend towards the priuities, for that through their hot tumors they hinder the passage of the vrine, whereby the strangury is prouoked, and especially when they do not bléed. Now for to know these hidden Piles and diseases, there is nothing more certaine than to set a great boxe or cup on the Arsegut without pricking, the which will draw the Arsegut outward, so that it may be apparantly séene how that the case doth consist within. The sixt kind of Piles are the Figs, a certaine excrescence vpon the Arsegut outwardly, who with a little veine like the stalke of a fig, is fastened to the gut, formed as it were a small dry fig, from thence a little bigger, and is
pressed downe on the top like a Fig, which is called of the Gréekes Condyloma, which is an ex∣crescence of flesh, for it hapneth sometimes that round about the roundnes of the Arsegut, or fast besides it, there do come great scabs which sometimes (yet vncertaine whether it be first or last according as the patient ruleth himselfe) do happen to bléede, sometimes much and some∣times little. These figs and swellings are tempered also with bloud and melancholy, a little red outwardly and perilous ynough, euen as hereafter shall be further expressed. In all these Species of the Pyles, the learned haue a generall rule, that they estéeme them for an accident that can hardly be cured. They recite nine causes of these accidents, albeit we will recite but fowre. First, for that it is in an vncleane place, and no man medleth willingly therewith. Secondly, for that this place is very hard to be séene. Thirdly, for that it is a place whither all vncleannes of the bodie doth descend: Lastly, for that it is a place cold by nature, and therefore voyd of strength, notwithstanding there be many good remedies prouided and ordained for them, as hereafter followeth. But before we discourse of the foresayd remedies for the Pyles, Blathers, Figs, Warts, Tumors, and their accidents, we will first of all shew their causes, and teach how the same may be cured, for which the principallest is to obserue a good dyet in meate and drinke, and such like. Of the Dyet. IT is sufficiently declared before, that the greatest cause of these accidents is the heauie me∣lancholick bloud, which is mixt with the pure bloud, and perisheth the same, which all other members expell from them, like as it were a poyson, and so falleth downewards from the other bloud into the veines, openeth them through his heate, and maketh them bleed. This is altogether caused of a bad digestion of the stomack, and other members, and of all such grosse meates, whereof there can be none other ingendred but melancholick bloud, the which must be altogether left off, as Beanes, Lentils, and other Pottages. Item, Coleworts, Chéese, old Beefe, Harts, Hares, Goats, salted and smoked flesh, sodden Wheate, Rice, vnlea∣uened bread, which bring much moysture with them. Also all water Fowles, Eeles and other Fish without scales, féete, heads, and all entrailes of Beasts, grosse Wine, Must, and Béere. Item, all things which burne the bloud, as much Mustard, Pepper, Garlick, Onions, Léekes. All things which be very cold do also increase melancholie, as Melons, Cucumbers, and such like. Amongst the medicins which are contrary for this disease, are Coloquint, Centorie, Scam∣monie, and chiefely Aloe, very hurtfull for the Arsegut, for it openeth the Pyles. Euen as we haue recited what is hurtfull for this disease, so will we also teach what manner of dyet might be commodious and profitable for the same. The dwelling of this patient must be a warme and dry place, which is close and toward the South. But if the house be not of it selfe fit thereto, then is it to be prepared for the same with fire and fumes: yet is alwayes to be eschued things which be too hote, and must take the mild meane which are hot and dry, as Fran∣kinsence, Lignum Aloes, red Styrax, Laudanum, and such like. And whereas all kinds of Pyles do agrée in this, they be caused of bloud and melancholie (like as is alreadie alledged) and of both together mixed, so may the patient vse one and the selfe same dyet. Next after the dwelling place, the patient must also according to the time of the yeare, pro∣uide himselfe of clothes, which are meetely dry and warme, kéepe the head well couered, and defend the outward members from all cold. His meate must be white bread, not aboue thrée dayes old, Egs, Butter, Lambs flesh, Veale, Kids, Mutton, Pullets, Capons, Partriches, Phesants, and Pigeons, yet of all these a little: in like manner all field Fowles. His drinke shall be good white Wine, all grosse and sowre Wines shall he forbeare, albeit that it were much better a good Sugred water than Wine, sodden Milke, fresh and meetely well salted Chéese, be méetely good for him; but good regard must be had that he féede thereof mode∣rately, so that the stomack be not ouercharged. But if any excesse be perceiued, then is it not amisse that the patient be moued to vomit, and to take that with one ounce and a halfe of Vineger, and three ounces of warme water, & after∣wards
to put the finger into the throate, and if that will not be, then may he take an easie Clister. These patients are alwayes for the most part bounden in the bodie, the which bringeth with it great paine and griefe, therefore diligence is to be had that he kéepe an open bodie, for this shall he sup euery morning and euening before meate some broath, wherein is sodden Mer∣cury, Mallowes, Burrage, Beetes, and Fumitorie, and with a little of the oyle of swéete Al∣monds or Butter. Also to eate sometimes new Prunes and Reisons, and drinke vpon it some broth of Coleworts; after that, he may eate some other meates. Also it were not amisse, to eate against this binding of the body one dragme of péeled wild Saffron séede, or one quarter of an ounce of Cassie, now the one, and then the other. Reasonable motion, yet more with the hands, then with the féete or the whole bodie, is very good, but riding and sitting hard is very bad. In fine, long rest is better then short, so must it be alwayes with sléepe. He must lye most vpon his right side, but little on his left side, or on his back. Lastly, he must vtterly eschue all sorrow, vexations, anger, and other passions of the minde. To staunch the bleeding of the Pyles. §. 5. FOr to come to the remedie of this accident, therefore we will first begin if these Pyles hapned to bléede ouermuch, how and wherewith the same is staunched. First therefore we will rehearse this (whereof hath also béene spoken before) that if this bléeding chaunce without paine, and not but by flawes, then is it no counsell to stay it vnlesse the patient were greatly weakened thereby. For when these veines begin to bléede, then do they exonerate the whole body of many melancholick diseases, as of the Leprosie, Pocks, dry Itch, Dropsie, quartaine Agues, hardnes of ye Milt, or Spléene, and mo other such like infirmities, which grow of burnt bloud, and of such like humors, as hereafter shall appeare in a proper §, wherein shall be taught how the same shall be opened: also if they that accustomed to bléede and now remaine stopt, do cause the Dropsie, the Consumption, and many other Sicknesses. But if the bléeding of them do get the maistrie, and thereby do weaken the patient, then must the same be staunched; and take good héed, whether the same bléeding be on the right side, for it is sometimes a messenger of some long lingring sicknes, as headach, giddines, hinderance of the breath, and to conclude, féeblenes of the whole bodie, so that he cannot well go nor stand: at the last followeth great thirst and binding of the bodie. When as then these kinds of inconueniences do all appeare, or part of them, then must such bléeding be staunched out of hand, and forbeare from all manner of Spices, also from Onions, Garlick, Mustard, strong white Wine, Venery, great labour, and all such like things, which inflame the bloud; and to the contrary, vse all things that increase bloud: for this, is also good the sirupes of Quinces, Roses, Mirtles, Trocisci de Terra sigillata, and de Carabe. These staun∣chers of bloud must be laid outwardly vpon the Fundament: Take the white of an Egge, and temper amongst it beaten Momy, sealed earth, fine Bolus, and Dragon bloud. Also these things following by their proper vertue, staunch this bléeding, as Amber, prepa∣red Bloudstone, burnt or prepared Corall, Dragon bloud, fine Bolus, burnt Vitrioll, Aloe, Plantaine, Mastick, Blossoms of Pomgranats, the barks of Frankinsence, Copwebs, Hares haires cut small, burnt Asse dung, and powdred Basill. The compounded things are these, Trocisci de Corallis, de Spodio: Also, one may take one dragme of Amber and sealed earth with water wherein is decocted Butchers broome séede. The pils of Bdellio, and de Sandaraca, must one take the first eight daies the waight of halfe a dragme, and fast fiue howres after it. Powders and other things to staunch Bloud. TAke the bones of Buls féete, red and white Corall, the stones of Dates, Oyster shels, burnt al together, of each one quarter of an ounce, Vitriol halfe a dragme, burnt Iuorie, Amber, and Bloudstone, of each three dragmes, Dragon bloud, the iuice of Sloes, the powder of sowre Pomgranat blossoms, Dragagant and Gum, both of them tosted, of each two
dragmes and a halfe, beate them together very small, and temper one amongst another, then strew it vpon the place of the bléeding, & lay Cotton thereon, which is made wet in Rose vine∣ger, afterwards bind it hard vpon it, this stauncheth bloud maruellously, although it had conti∣nued a yeare and a day; and not onely for this, but also for all excessiue bléeding. There may also a plaister be made of the foresaid powder, and Mill dust with the iuice of Plantaine, Comfrey or Tassels. Item, take Aloe, Frankinsence, Dragon bloud, Pomgranate blossomes, and Sief memithe, of each a like much, make a powder thereof, and vse it as before. Another. Take Cypers nuttes, and worme eaten Gals, of each halfe a dragme, Dragon bloud, Mummy, Dragagant and Gum, both of them tosted, of each one dragme, Gips halfe an ounce, temper them all together, and strew therewith the whole Arsegut, it stancheth bleeding a whole day. One more. Take the yellow séedes of the Rose, stampe them to powder, strew it thereon, for they drie and staunch bloud. Item, take Hermodactyli two scruples, prepared Antimonie one dragme, Frankinsence one scruple, Myrrhe halfe a scruple, make a powder therof, and strew it vpon the Pyles where they bléede: and further, spread round about the same Pyles this salue following: Take of the vnguent Pompholygos halfe an ounce, vnguent of Roses two ounces, oyle of Quinces, Linséede oyle, and oyle of Nuts, of each halfe an ounce, Hermodactyli two scruples, Pomegranate blossomes & Dragagant, of each one scrup. Mummy, Dragon bloud, and prepa∣red Tutty, of each one dragme, Beane meale and Mill dust, of each one dragme, Plantaine, Verbascum, Willow leaues, Mirtle leaues, and Horse tayles, of each one dragme and a halfe, Camfer ten greines, oyle of Roses as much as is néedfull therewith to make a salue, spread thereof vpon a woollen cloth and lay it vpon the Fundament: the bloud of the Pyles hath ther∣with bene stanched at sundry times, when all other remedies had bene vsed, and would not helpe, vntill this aforesaid was applyed. Item, take Gips, beate it small, and make it to dough with the beaten white of an Egge, this stauncheth bloud maruellous well, and that in a quar∣ter of an howre, in what sort of bléeding soeuer it be. Item, take Aloe, Frankinsence, Dragon bloud, fine Bolus, and small cut haires of a Hare, of each one quarter of an ounce, beate them all small, afterwards take a Cobweb out of a Mill, rub it amongst it, and make thereof a salue with the white of an Egge, and annoynt the place therewith; this also stauncheth much. It is also good for rent or cut veines, where the bloud cannot be staunched. Or take the water of Hounds toung, distilled from the herbe and root; when the Pyles grow inward, then are you to take euery morning therof foure ounces, but if they be outward, then cleanse the same, and lay on this water with a cloth, it healeth much. Another: Take the kernels of Abricockes one ounce and a halfe, oyle of Mastick, and vnripe Sallad oyle, of each thrée ounces, the iuice of Sloes, Dragagant, Gumme, and Fish lime, or Isinglas, which haue bene long stéeped and are dissolued in the foresaid oyle, of each thrée quar∣ters of an ounce, temper them together, and dip Cotton therein, and hold it continually on the Fundament. You may also prepare this following: Take Masticke, Spica, Cypers rootes, Squinant, Calmus, Saffron, and Myrrhe, of each a like much, make a plaister thereof with red Wine, and lay it ouer the Liuer. Item, take the iuice of Plantaine two ounces, Rosewater halfe an ounce, beaten séedes of Butchers broome, as much as is néedfull for to make a mild plaister, lay this vpon the Arse∣gutte. Here now follow some Salues. TAke oyle of Myrtle and of Masticke, of each one ounce, Trocisci de Carabe, Paper glewe, burnt Date stones, burnt Iuorie, Sandaraca, and Bloudstone, of each one dragme, Waxe as much as is néedefull for to make therewith a soft salue, annoynt therewith the fundament. Or take beaten Plantaine, Verbascum, Willow leaues, Mirtle leaues, and Horse tayles, of each a like much: to an ounce and a halfe of this powder, adde ten graines of Camfere, and oyle
of Roses as much as is néeedfull for to make salue thereof. This stancheth bloud, and dryeth gently. A precious salue. Take Comin, Caraway, Rue séed, Ameos, Seseli, & Galliae Muschatae, of each one dragme and a halfe, Rosin thrée dragmes, oyle of Dill two ounces, Sallad oyle one ounce, Lignum Aloes, and Cloues, of each half a dragme; melt the Rosin in the oyle, and temper it with the other things being beaten small, stir it then well about vntill it be a thicke salue. This salue verily hath great vertues, it stauncheth the excessiue Termes in women, if they annoint the raynes and hips therewith: being applyed on the Nauell and the stomacke it expelleth wind, and taketh away vomiting and parbraking. Wil you then haue it stronger to vse for ye Pyles? then temper amongst it two scruples of Saffron, and one dragme of Opium. Other good Salues moe. TAke dryed Orange péels, beate them very small, put thereto a rosted Apple, and bruise it in a dish: then temper the foresaid powder amongst it vntill it be as thicke as a Salue: then wash first the Pyles with Plantaine water, and afterwards annoint it with the foresaid salue. Take two ounces of new Waxe, thrée ounces of Hony, foure ounces of Butter; melt them all together, and straine it warme thorow a cloth: then set it vpon the fire againe, and stir ther∣in as much Wheate floure vntill it be as thicke as pap, and then lay it thereon. Item, take white Dogs dung, that hath eaten nothing but bones, burne it to ashes, and make a salue ther∣of with cleane Barrowes grease, and annoynt therewith the Pyles, and then strew thereon the powder of Hermodactiles. Or take the stones of Indian Mirobalans, burn them to powder: thereof take halfe an ounce, prepared Iron drosse one quarter of an ounce, temper them well together with the iuice of Plantaine in a mortar, and therewith annoint the Arsegut within and without. If so be that these forementioned will not helpe, then take two ounces of the iuice of Roses, the brayed whites of a couple of Egs, Gips thrée dragmes; bruse them in a mortar one amongst another, and vse it as aforesaid. The like is also counselled, when as this bléeding commeth too sore, that the Basilica is to be opened, whereby to deriue and withdraw the bloud, and after∣wards that he be bathed with water wherein Linséede and the séedes of Hollihocks be decocted or at the leastwise that he be well fomented therewith. Lastly, like as it is said already, there must be layd thereon beaten Parietarie, or Pellitorie of the wall. For to foment withall, take Pomegranate blossomes, Roses, Cipers nuts, séedes of But∣chers broome, Pomegranate péels, Mirtle seed, the iuice of Sloes, Frankinsence, of each halfe an ounce, beate them a little, and seeth them in thicke red wine, and water, of each a like much, and foment the place with sponges; or set the patient in water wherein Gals, Pomegranate blossomes, butchers Broome, Mirtle seede and such like are decocted. Item, seeth Turnep leaues in water, and therewith wash oftentimes the Fundament meetly warme. Another: Boyle Rose campion in thicke red Wine, and foment the Pyles of∣ten therewith. If so be that through all these remedies the bloud be not stanched, then dippe a litle wooll in boyling oyle, and lay it hot vpon it, then will it cease. Afterwards place him in water wherein Gals, Pomgranat peels and the blossomes, the barke of the Medlar tree, Seruises, Roses, and Allume, of ech one ounce beaten grosse were decocted: but red wine were more forcible for this. How that the inward Pyles are to be staunched. OF this hath mention bene made at the first; and for this purpose doe serue these foresaid remedies, if they be to be had. For the staunching of these Pyles, if they do bleed ex∣cessiuely, then is this salue especially to be ordained for them: Take Pomgranate blos∣somes and peels, burnt Mussell shels, Frankinsence, Masticke, Dragon bloud, sealed earth, and Copwebs, of each a like much; make a powder thereof with dissolued Isinglas, and common glew in steeled water: make then a taint of Hares haire, or at leastwise of wooll, and lay it to steepe therein, and put it into the Fundament, refreshing it oftentimes.
What is to be vsed inwardly to staunch this bleeding. FOr this excessiue bléeding of the Pyles are these things following highly commended: Take Mirobalani Indi, Emblici, Bellirici a little parched, of each fiue dragmes, Perles halfe a dragme, temper them all togither with the iuice of Garlicke, and vse halfe a drag. there∣of at one time with stéeled water: the party is also euery morning to eate a couple of confected Mirobalans Chebuli, and to fast fower howers vpon it, and that during the space of ten daies, or as long as the bleeding continueth. A stronger: Take the confection of Triphera, ex parte Phe∣nouis, or de Scoria ferri, (of which you will) one quarter of an ounce or lesse, tempered in two ounces of Purslaine water. Also the iuice of Yarrow may be taken for this one ounce and a halfe: the same stancheth much. Item take Wormewood, Venus haire, and Sorrell, of each one handfull, Sorrell séed and the séeds of Plantaine, Melons, Purslaine and Roses, of each one dragme; seeth them in fayre well water, afterwards wring it out, and put thereto the shales of yellow Mirobalans one quarter of an ounce, red and white prepared Corall, Citron séed, of each halfe a dragme, let it seeth to thrée or foure ounces, then mixe with this decoction Syrupum Acetosum Compositum one ounce, Syrupum de Plantagine halfe an ounce, take this certaine daies one after another in the morning betimes. For this is also good one quarter of an ounce of Galbanum, dissolued in water and dronken. A very commodious confection for to be taken alwaies before meat: Take Butchers broome seed, parched séed of broade Plantaine, the iuice of Sloes, and Coriander, of each one scruple, Amber, all beaten small, and Sugar which is dissolued in Purslaine water thrée ounces: take thrée dragmes thereof at one time. Aboue all these astringent medicines you shall finde manie moe in the discourse of the excessiue fluxe of the Termes in women: also in the first part where many are specified for the staunching of blood, the which are altogither good for this purpose. How that the Pyles are to be opened. §. 6. WHat good this bléeding of the Pyles doth cause whē it commeth by nature and of it selfe, and from what sicknes it will preserue a man, it is partly declared in the 5. §. Likewise what this bléeding doth procure if it be staunched contrary to the old custome: also what inconueniences may come & ensue thereof. When as this bleeding discōtinueth, & the Pyles do vexe the patient with great paine and extuberation, then are they to be opened for to let the blood haue his accusto∣med course; for this preserueth one (besides all the recited perillous maladies) from all corro∣ding vlcers, wildfire, cankers, madnes, melancholy, falling sicknes, enflaming of the Lights, both the kinds of dropsies and consumption. And if so be that this blood be staunched, then is it to be feared, that all the foresaid diseases may ensue thereby: therefore when any body desireth to open them, then are these things following to be vsed. First put the sicke body in a bath whereby the Pyles may be mollified. Or in the stéed ther∣of make this fomentation: Take Marierom, field Mints, and Mallowes, séeth them in wine, and receiue the vapor thereof from beneath, sitting on a close stoole méetly warme: the next day after open the Saphea, or the Median. The Saphea is vpon the hindermost part of the foot, besides the héele, whereby the melancholicke blood is drawen downeward: afterwards annoynt the Pyles with oyle of bitter Almonds, or oyle of Nuts: also a little Cotton is good for this, made wet in the iuice of Onions, and laid thereon. This may you effect also with the Gals of all beasts, although the Oxe gall be especially cōmended aboue all the rest. Secondly, put Horslea∣ches into them through a pipe, whereby they may fall right vpon the Pyles, for by nature they do draw out the melancholicke blood, which is contrary to the boxing cups: Therefore if there be boxing cups set vpon it, then must they be fastened vnpickt, be it on man or woman, and that betwéene the priuities and the Arsegut. Thirdly, rub the Arsegut with Fig leaues vntill it be∣gin to bléede, in like sort may the powder of Nep, of Marierom, of Fleawort, of Swines bred, & of Pepper, or any other biting powder, as Cantharides and Esula: also Flammula may be laid thereon. But if you will haue milder things, then take the iuice of Centorie, or water wherein a good quantitie of Mallowes be decocted. Item, beaten Stauesacre tempered with Honie.
Fourthly, this is the most certaine way, viz. that two or thrée pyles be opened with the Flew, and to the end they may not shut suddenly together againe, like as their nature is, then vse this salue following: Take oyle of Peach kernels, of Abricock kernels, (or the same kernels bea∣ten) and the iuice of Garlick, of each one quarter of an ounce, Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make a salue. But if so be that these inward Pyles cannot be séene, then must the patient be required once to strayne hard as if he would goe to the stoole. Do not the Pyles as yet appeare thereby? then let a boxe or cup with a wide mouth be set vpon the fundament: when these haue pluckt out the Arsegut, then open a veine or twayne that be fullest. Fiftly, vse this salue follo∣wing: Take small beaten Aloe one quarter of an ounce, Oxe gals one ounce, Vineger two ounces, temper them all together, put therein some Cotton, or wet a cloth, and rub it well therewith. Item, take Centorie, Rapontica, Stauesacre, Flammula, and white Néesewort, of each alike much, temper it with Oxe gall, and the iuice of Onions; let it then dry, stampe it, and once againe do as before. Reiterate this fowre times together, when you will vse this, then wash well the Pyles with warme water, and temper the foresayd powder with Oxe gall, and annoynt therewith the Pyles. Another. Take two small Onions, fowre heads of Garlick, beate them together, and tem∣per them with the meale of Lupins, and with very eager Vineger vnto a plaister, which will open the Pyles immediatly. Sixtly, make a long suppository of Swines bread, put it vp into the fundament, & kéepe it therein a whole night; if it come out, then put in another, vntill the Pyles begin to bléede. Also with the suppositories of wild Cucumber rootes do the like. Item, take Coloquint thrée drag. bitter Almonds halfe an ounce, sodden Hony thrée ounces, and make suppositories thereof, and vse another euery fiue howres, so that the Pyles will then bléede immediatly. Some do open these veines with hote yrons, and some through Cauteries potentiall, as Arsenicum and such like, but because they are perilous, it is better to rest with the former remedies. Against the paine of the Pyles. §. 7. IF so be that there be any impostume besides the paine of the Pyles outwardly on the Arsegut, then must the patients Liuer veine be opened on the right hand, and this plaister following laid vpon the Fundament thereby to asswage the paine: Take the yolk of a rosted Eg, one dragme of Saffron, Opium halfe a drag. Linséede meale, Wheate meale, the muscilage of Linséede, Butter, and Goats suet, of each halfe an ounce, a fresh yolke of an Egge, Roses one dragme and a halfe, Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make therewith a soft plaister. Item, take Hollihock rootes sixe ounces, Lilly rootes one ounce and a halfe, great Mallowes and Henbane, of each one dragme and a halfe, Cammomill one ounce, Melilot and Dill séede, of each one quarter of an ounce: let these séethe well all togither, and stamp them to growt; then temper therewith Fenegréeke meale, Linséede meale, and Barly meale, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, oyle of Sesamum one ounce and a halfe, Opium halfe a dragme: make thereof a soft plaister, with the decoction wherein they were boyled. Many kindes of Salues, against the paine of the Pyles. TAke oyle of the kernels of Abricocks one ounce, oyle of Roses halfe an ounce, Ducks grease, and washt Butter, of each thrée dragmes, Bdellium one quarter of an ounce, melt it in the foresayd oyles, Waxe as much as is needfull therewith to make a soft plaister, Or take oyle of Peach kernels, and oyle of bitter Almonds, of each one ounce, liquid Styrax, Bdellium, of each one dragme, temper them well together, and therewith annoynt the griefe. Item, take oyle of Roses, oyle of the yolks of Egs, Ducks and Hens grease, of each halfe an ounce, Waxe thrée quarters of an ounce, melt them all together, and vse it like as the rest, couering it with warme clothes. Item, take of that well knowen plaister Diachilon one ounce, oyle of Roses halfe an ounce, the yolke of an Egge, Saffron and Opium, of each one scruple, temper it well togither, and therewith annoynt the place where the paine is.
Another. Take Opium one dragme, dissolue it in Rose water, make Cotton wet therein, and lay it vpon the Pyles, and kéepe it a little while therein, it doth presently asswage the paine. But note, that all these narchotick and stupefactiue remedies must be applyed warme vnto it. Item, take oyle of Roses and Violets, of each a like quantitie, and lay it warme vpon it with a woollen cloth. Or take oyle of Roses and fresh Butter one quarter of an ounce, the iuice of Garlick one dragme, Bolus, Dragon bloud, Gum, Roses, Myrrh, and Pomegranat blossoms, of each two scruples, powne all that is to be powned, and temper them all togither. Item, take oyle of Roses, & the white of an Egge, of each a like much, with a few crums of bread stéeped in Milke, and a little Saffron tempred amongst it, and so vse it. Item, take Vine cute two quarts, and the yolks of two Egs well brayed, Saffron halfe a dragme, Cammomill powder, and Dill powder, of each one dragme, temper thē togither. Or (that which is more maruellous and bet∣ter) take the yolks of fowre Egs, oyle of Roses three ounces, Saffron one dragme, temper them together: this is somewhat stronger: Take the oyle of water Lillies, Cammomill and Dill, of each one ounce, Saffron one dragme, the yolks of thrée Egs, Barly meale two ounces, let these séethe together in two ounces of the iuice of Lettice, vntill the iuice be wasted, then put thereto Henbane séed, and Opium, of each one dragme, and lay it vpon the Pyles. Item, take the middle of corne roses, and temper it with the oyle of Abricock kernels vnto a soft salue, and vse it as the rest, for it is very good, and approued. Philonium Romanum rubbed on the Pyles asswageth the paine greatly. Item, take fresh Butter, and oyle of Violets, of each halfe an ounce, and beate amongst it the white of an Egge. Or take oyle of Roses, and Linséede oyle, of each one ounce, oyle of Abricock kernels one ounce and a halfe, muscilage of Fenegréeke, and of Linséed, Butter and Goats suet, of each one ounce, the yolks of thrée Egs, and Waxe as much as is néedfull for a salue. Another. Take Linséede, Hollyhock seede, Fenegréeke, Verbascum séede, S. Iohns Woort, Mallowes, and Hounds toong, of each one handfull, séethe them together in water, and foment the place infected with a sponge, afterwards annoynt the foresayd place with oyle of Egs, for euery ounce and a half whereof, haue one graine of Opium. Or take Sallad oyle as much as you thinke good, powned Chalke as much as is néedfull therewith to make a plaister, it dryeth well, and cooleth much. This can oyle of Oliues do also alone, being made warme, and Shéepes wooll vndrest dipped in it, and so applyed vnto the Pyles. Item, take Verdigreace one quarter of an ounce, burnt Allume one ounce, dissolue them in Wine, & then vse it with Shéepes wooll. Or take Ducks grease, the fat of Shéepes wooll, Goats suet, and white Waxe, of each a like quantitie molten together. Item, take Harts suet one ounce & a half, the grease of a Heronshaw halfe an ounce, melt and stirre them togither vntill they be very white. This next following is passing forcible for to asswage the paine: Take a great Onion, make it hollow within, and fill it with Sallad oyle, or fresh Butter: afterwards close it againe, and rost it in the ashes vntill it be mellow, then binde it on the Pyles. Also you must boyle Onions to growt, and temper them with Sugar, and vse it as is said; they be both very good. Item, annoynt the Pyles with the iuice of Rosemary or Cloues, and lay a Peach leafe vpon it, this asswageth much the paine. This following dryeth, and easeth also the paine: Take powned Housléeke two ounces, small brused litharge of Gold one quarter of an ounce, séethe them with fresh Butter to the thicknes of a salue. These two salues ensuing do mollifie the hardnes, and take away the paine: Take Ducks and Hens grease, of each one ounce, oyle of Roses two ounces, Waxe as much as shall suffice: let them melt togither, and coole afterwards, then mixe the yolke of an Egge amongst it, and one dragme of Opium, and halfe a dragme of Saffron. Item, take fine Bolus, Gum, Mastick, Dragon bloud, Roses, and Pomegranat blossoms, of each three dragmes, powne them all small, Butter one ounce, oyle of Roses three ounces, iuice of Garlick thrée ounces, iuice of red Saxifrage fowre ounces, melt all that is to be molten, and temper the rest amongst it, this alayeth the swelling, asswageth the paine, dryeth and healeth all vlcers, and it is also especiall good for all clefts of the fundament. Certaine Powders for the same. TAke Garden Snailes as many as you please, put them into a pot stopped tight, and burne them at a potbakers ouen to ashes, strewe these vpon the Pyles, it asswageth the paine
forthwith: also it is to be asswaged with Egge shels, wherein Chickens haue béene hatched, or with dried Cipers nuts powned to powder, and strewed thereon, as before. Of fomenting, bathing, and such like. TAke Mallowes, Hollihocke leaues, Violet leaues, Bearefoote, Garlicke and Parietarie, of each two handfuls, Cammomill, Amaranthus, of each one handfull, chop the herbes, séethe them in water, and place the patient lukewarme therein. Or take Oken leaues, Houndstoong, Mallowes and Cammomill, of each two handfuls, Fenegreeke, Lineseed, of each one ounce, stampe and séethe them in water; then make a spoonge wet therein, and so applie it warme vnto the fundament. Also you may lay these herbs following, being sodden, thereupon. Item, take small beaten Pease, cast them on a hot stone, and receiue the vapor from beneath: it swageth the paine, it drieth wonderously, and taketh away all superfluous flesh. If so be that the fume or smoke be noysome to you, then put some wine thereto. Item, take Caruway, make it pretie moyst with wine, cast it also vpon a hot stone, and receiue the smoke, as aforesaid: or take Gariophillata and Lady mantle, of each one handfull, séethe it in a bag, and therewith fo∣ment the raines. This hath holpen whereas the piles hang out a finger long, and it cannot hurt women with child. Take Venus haire and Water torch, of each a like quantitie, butter as much as you thinke good, let it séeth all togither, powre the butter through a cloth, and herewith annoint the pyles: it is said that this hath holpen the piles, where the paine hath continued twelue yeeres long. You may also annoint the piles with Ducks grease, wherein Colewoorts haue béene fried, be it before, or after the bath. Of the Piles which are called Verrucales. §. 8. NOte that this sort of Piles are called Verrucales, for that they be much harder than the other, and therefore haue more néede of mollifying and discussiue reme∣dies: and those must be vsed according to the oportunitie of the time and the age of the patient. In the sommer there is to be laid thereon thrée yolks of egs with oyle of Violets, also swéete vnsalted butter, or oyle of swéete Almonds tempered with muscilage of Lineséed, and Fenegréeke. If so be then the paine be intolerable, then temper a little Opium, Mandragora, Henbane séede, Poppie séede, or such like amongst it. The old Phisitions describe very many such like things for remedies, but these a∣foresaid shall be here sufficient. Of the Piles that do hang far out. §. 9. BVt when as the Piles do hang far out, and do so drie that they waxe blacke and stinking, then are they often to be annointed with warme butter, vntill the blacknes be againe cleane: and if so be that such stinking moysture would pro∣céede further, then vse the foresaid corsiues. But in case that this rotting cease, then will it heale foorthwith with the salue of Ceruse and such like. There are also vsed sometimes for this hot irons. Also while they be gréene, they may be cut off with a paire of sizers, and afterwards the white of an egge and oyle of Roses laid vpon it, to asswage the paine. But when they be old, then it is safest that they be bound about with a silke thred, and so often repeate the same till they die and fall away of themselues. The which afterwards is to be further healed with the salue Apostolorum, and to lessen the paine, stéepe the silke thred or horse haire in Rose water before, wherein is dissolued two or thrée graines of Opium. In the same manner may all other warts of the bodie be driuen away, whereof we will speake in the fift part. Here before in the common description of the Piles, we haue rehearsed the kinds of these grieuous Piles. Through these Piles there is to be feared, whē they begin to corrode, that they may so infect the Arsegut, that there may follow a Canker or Fistula, yea that which is more, if there follow a salt defluxion to them, that the waies may be so dilated and opened, that the pa∣tient might bléede to death. For this disease, there is great héede to be taken, to forbeare all hot
meates, as Radishes, Mustard, Garlicke, Onions, and from all spiced meates. For this must he also abstaine from all ouer cooling and slimie things, as fish, dough, and all entrailes, sinewes, and skins of beasts. Méetely good red wine shall be his drinke. But if (as it often falleth out) there come any other Piles, then are such meates and drinks to be forborne as make melan∣cholike blood, as pottage of Beanes and Pease: but red and white Pease, and Turkie Beanes may be eaten sometimes drest with Sallad oyle. Also in this case the Median is to be opened, and fiue or sixe ounces of blood to be let out, according to the strength and age of the patient. But if this letting of blood may not be done for some causes, and that it be thought better to applie Horsleaches, as is already said, that may safely be done; yet first make the place moyst with cold water, for then will they fasten the rather. When as the Leaches be full, then fall they off of themselues: if not, then strike them off with a twig, or burne thē off with a Waxe candle. But if after their falling off the bléeding will not stanch, then lay this plaister following there∣on: Take Starch and Mill dust, of each one drag. fine Bolus, Dragon blood, Aloe, Sarcocolla, Frankinsence, Hypocistis, of each one quarter of an ounce, the iuice of Plantaine as much as is requisite, temper it in a leaden mortar vntill it be very tough. A plaister: Take of hard Pitch three ounces, Rosin and Isinglas, of each one ounce, Draga∣gant, Gum, Sarcocolla, of each one dragme and a halfe, refuse of Iron halfe an ounce, make a plaister therof with red vineger. This is for this purpose as forcible a remedy as may be found: Item, take wood ashes two ounces, Yarrow, Pellitory of the wall, Cammomill, and rosted Squils, of each two ounces, burnt Allume one quarter of an ounce, red wine as much as is néedfull for to make a plaister, and apply it warme. Item, take Yarrow, Parietarie, of each one handfull, Salt halfe an ounce, and vse this daily. It is said also that this for certaine will cure the Piles, namely, Venus haire with Aristologie beaten and tempered with red wine, and so continually vsed thereon. This following is said to be infallible: Take the ashes of an herbe which the Germans call Roorwort, and rosted Squils, of each two ounces, honie as much as is néedfull for to tem∣per this withall; apply it, and it healeth very spéedily. The confection of Iron drosse de Scoria ferri, must be vsed sixe daies one after another, euery morning one quarter of an ounce, and fast fiue howers vpon it. And if the Piles be without any affluxe of humors, or other accident, then are you to vse this following: Take oyle of Abri∣cocke kernels 3. ounces, liquid Styrax one quarter of an ounce, fower hard sodden yolks of egs, prepared Iron drosse, Sandaraca and Sarcocolla stéeped in womans milke, of each one dragme and a halfe, Muske three graines; bruse this a long time togither, afterwards temper as much Barly meale amongst it as is néedfull for a plaister, annoint therwith the Piles inwardly and outwardly. But if so be that ye patient haue neede of any purging, vse thereto those things that are ordained in the description of the other Piles. Or take of the confection Diasena thrée quar∣ters of an ounce, temper it with whay of milke, and take it betimes in the morning. After the purgation the Arsegut is to be annoynted the next day with these things next after following. Take Swines bread, Cowslips, Bistorta, Dog fennell and red Saxifrage, of each one dragme and a halfe, Alumen Iamenum one drag. oyle of Abricock kernels and Rosine, of each one ounce: temper them all togither, and annoint therewith fower times a day, and lay this plaister fol∣lowing vpon it. Take the plaister Apostolicon that shall be hereafter described, halfe an ounce, burnt Coppe∣ras, Frankinsence, Colophonia & Orpiment, of each one scruple: mingle it all togither in a mor∣tar, till that it be a plaister, with a little dissolued Laudanum, but it may not be laid vpon the fundament: but whereas the least exulceration is, the vaine exulcerated is to be annointed with the foresaid salue, and if there come any scabs thereto, then must they be oftentimes an∣nointed with the oyle of swéete Almonds. The Plaister Apostolicon which is also called Triapharmacon, is described after two manner of waies: the first is a good Triapharmacon, for that it is made of three things, as followeth. TAke small Litharge of gold and vineger, of each fower ounces,Apostolicon. old Sallet oyle eight ounces, let them seethe so long togither vntill all the vineger be sodden away, alwaies stirring it about, till it be the thicknes of a plaister. This plaister maketh the flesh grow,
and healeth all wounds. Some put amongst it one quarter of an ounce of Verdigrease, Waxe and Turpentine, of each as much as pleaseth them best, and when it is made, then it is called at the Apothecaries Apostolicon. The second: Take eight ounces of Sallad oyle, small brused litharge of golde fower ounces, Vineger eight ounces, let it séethe well, and then put thereto prepared Galbanum, Frankinsence, Myrrhe, Masticke, Tormentill, of each halfe an ounce, Dragon blood thrée quarters of an ounce, Aloe two ounces beaten small, Waxe one ounce, then mingle them all togither, and let it seethe to a plaister. There are other means moe to heale these kinds of Pyles, namely that they be cut off where they be thinnest: But by reason that then they bleede much, therfore it is more certaine to take away the same with actuall cauteries or hot irons, which is not vnknowen to all Chirurgians, which is afterward better to be holpen. Some take them away with potentiall cauteries or corosiues, as with powned Anacardus, Orpiment, Arsenicum, and such like: afterward they lay salue thereon that asswageth the paine; and mollifie the escars with sweete butter, or some other fatnes: But the binding, whereof we haue spoken, is more certaine. Of the impostumes in the Arsegut. §. 10. IT happeneth also very well when that one commeth to burne, cut, or corrode these Pyles, that thereby the blood is staunched: which notwithstanding, for that it cannot haue his course, doth sometimes putrifie there, and impostuma∣teth, and causeth also therewith great paine, heate, Agues and thirst: for which these things following may be vsed. First, the Liuer veine in the arme on the side of the accident, is to be opened, thereby to diminish the affluent blood. If the patient also be corpulent, then are boxing cups to be set on his shoulders with pricking. Further, you are to binde the vppermost parts of the bodie, and to chafe them, by reason that for this accident may no purging medicines be vsed, to the end that thereby the matter may be drawne out downewards. But if the great obstruction or binding of the body require any pur∣gation, then must the same be brought to passe with Clisters, and according to the oportunity of the time, to open also a veine besides the Anckles, and to vse this salue. Take oyle of Abricocke kernels two ounces, Bdellium one ounce, liquid Styrax one ounce and a quarter, fresh butter, Duckes grease, Starch, of each one ounce, white lead one drag. and a halfe: temper it a long time in a mortar, and make a salue thereof, annoynt therewith this impostume when the gut is turned and drawen forth, you shall finde good ease thereby. Secondly, take grease, Mallowes, Fenegreeke seede, of Sesamum and Lineséede of each sixe ounces; séethe them in water, straine them, stamp and temper them with halfe an ounce of Rie meale, oyle of Abricocke, vnripe Sallad oyle and oyle of swéete Almonds, of each one ounce, roots of Smallage, Elecampane rootes, of each halfe a dragme: lay this warme thereon, or set it thereon, that it touch very well the Arsegut, it is very good. Thirdly, if this impostume be not hereby sufficiently mollified, then vse this hereafter fol∣lowing: Take Sallad oyle seuen pounds and a halfe, swéete red wine sixe quarts, Saffron one dragme and a halfe, Bdellium one ounce; séethe all these togither vntill the Gum be dissolued: herein shall ye patient be set 4. times a day, being made luke warme, as déep as to his priuities. Others vse for such Impostumes as proceede of heate, this plaister: Take Mallowes and Nightshade, of each one handfull, Violets and shaled Lentils, of each two ounces; let this séethe till it be as thicke as grout: afterwards stir it well about in a mortar, and mingle therewith oyle of Violets, Roses and the white of an egge, of each a like much, as shall seeme néedfull for to make a plaister: spread then thereof on the Arsegut, and lay ouer it. Take white Lead fiue dragmes, Frankinsence one dragme and a halfe, litharge of gold one quarter of an ounce: This being beaten small, temper it with oyle of Roses, and therewith annoynt the impostume, spread it on a cloth, and lay it thereon. Item, take the crums of white bread, or in the steed thereof three ounces of Mill dust, oyle of sweete Almonds two ounces, beaten Saffron halfe an ounce, temper them one amongst ano∣ther, and lay them warme vpon it.
If there be a great heate present, then foment the impostume with Rose water, Purslaine water, or water of Nightshade, & afterward apply this salue following thereon: Take crums of white bread thrée ounces, oyle of Roses two ounces, Saffron, Opium, of each one quarter of an ounce, fowre yolks of Egs, fresh Butter one ounce, mixe them well together, and vse it as aboue. But if it proceede of a cold cause, then vse this following: Take Onions, Garlicke, and Woolblade, of each a like quantitie, boyle them till they be soft, and beate them to a grout, af∣terwards adde as much Butter and oyle of Cammomils as shall suffice. All that hath beene written before to asswage the paine, may be also vsed for this: But note this, if so be the impostume begin for to maturate, then are you to looke to open it, to the end that the matter corrode not inward, & so there follow a Fistula after it, which hapneth very often. Afterwards vse this salue following for to finish the cure: Take burnt lead, Cypers nuts, and prepared litharge of Gold, of each one dragme, Rosin one ounce, oyle of Mastick halfe an ounce, Waxe thrée quarters of an ounce: first melt the Rosin with the Waxe, and when it be∣ginneth to streame, then mingle the foresaid powder amongst it: you may also strew the pow∣der of Knotgras vpon it, for it dryeth much, and causeth great alterations. Of the Clefts that are called Rhagades. §. 11. WHat manner of infirmitie it is, is sufficiently declared in the fifth Chapter 2. §. These may procéede of fiue sundry causes in the Arsegut: as of the bloudie lix called Dysenteria, of too hard excrements; of heate and drought of the Arsegut; otherwhiles also of the Pyles that corrode inward; lastly, of some outward in∣conueniences that cleaue the Arsegut: the signes are paine, and burning, and sometimes such clefts as may be séene, and do yéeld a blacke greene, or red stin∣king matter. There are also two sorts, the one with matter, and the other without matter, whereof shall seuerally be spoken. First for to cure those that are without matter, the partie is first of all to be purged (if néede do require the same) and to open a veine, like as it is told of the Pyles, and especially with Epithymo, Polypodie, and Whay, by reason of the melancholick bloud: also in like manner with the pils of Bdellio, or with Clisters, and other like purgations. Afterwards when these clefts do yéeld matter, then are they often to be washed with water, wherein are sod Roses, Polypodie, and Allume, and afterwards annoynt thē with this salue following: Take ashes of Muscle shels, and rootes of Polypodie, of each two ounces, leaues of the Oliue trée halfe an ounce, poune them all small, and temper them with oyle of Roses, and if they be with inflammation, then vse salue made with Ceruse and Campher and other salues that follow hereafter. This following is maruellous good, for it dryeth, cooleth, and also healeth. Take litharge of Gold, white lead and burnt lead, of each alike much, bruse it in a leaden morter with Rose water, oyle of Roses, and whites of Egs as much as is néedfull, and with a little Campher, vntill that it be wholie black, annoint the clefts therewith, and lay a cloth ouer them. If there be no heate thereby but only a manifest drought, then take Hens and Ducks grease, marrow of Harts bones, and Calues bones, and the fatnes of Shéepes wooll, of each halfe an ounce, fresh Butter, oyle of sweete Almonds, oyle of Poppie séeds, Dragagant, oyle of Lillies, and oyle of Peach kernels, of each one quarter of an ounce, Myrrhe, Starch, Mill dust, Momy, Frankinsence, Mastick, Dragons bloud, white lead, and burnt Allume, of each one dragme, Waxe one ounce and a halfe, melt all these in the foresaid oyle and fats, and make thereof a salue: this salue asswageth the paine, moystneth and causeth the flesh to grow. Item; take yellow Waxe, oyle of Sesamum, Ducks grease, Marrow of Oxe bones, the fat of Cammels feete, or (in the stead of them) Goats suet, or Hens grease, and Bdellium, of each a like much, melt these together in Muscilage of Linséede, & temper them together, for it is very com∣modious. Item, take Turpentine, Ducks grease, oyle of Violets, of each two ounces, dissolued Dragagant and Waxe, of each one ounce, pouned Dragagant two ounces, temper them by the fire vnto a salue. Or take muscilage of Licebane one ounce, Hens grease one ounce and an halfe, the yolke of a new layd egge, Saffron one dragme, temper them one with an other, and annoynt the clefts therewith.
Another. Take Dragagant and Gall nuts, of each a like much; temper them with molten Oxe suet, and a little oyle of Roses vnto a salue. But if the vlcers be déepe, and yeeld much stinking matter, then are both outwardly and in∣wardly sharp waters to be vsed for them, and especially dresse it with the remedies that are de∣scribed in the first Part and the eight Chapter, of the vlcers of the Nose, or strewe them with Verdigrease, and powned Anacardus for to clense them. But note, that this corrosiue inwardly in the Arsegut is not wholly without danger, vnlesse the Arsegut be drawen out by a boxing cup. Afterwards coole and heale them with white lead, or any other cooling and healing salue. Item, take washed white lead, Aloe, Masticke, Frankinsence, and Dragon blood, of each three dragmes, oyle of Roses one ounce and a halfe, Waxe as much as is needfull. For this you may also vse the salue that was before described, and made in the leaden mortar, or pre∣pare this following. Take Pomegranate blossomes and the pils, Mirrhe, washed white Lead, burnt Lead, wa∣shed Aloes, séeds of Roses, Frankinsence, Masticke, Dragon blood, and burnt Mussell shels, of each one quarter of an ounce, Oliue leaues, burnt Allume, Alumen plumosum, Verdigrease, and Litharge of Gold, of each one dragme and a halfe, Waxe one ounce, melt this in as much oyle of Roses as is needfull to make a salue: vse this often times, and wash the vlcers twice or thrice a day with water wherein Gals, burnt Allume, Oliue leaues and Roses are decocted. These are very good for all such like diseases, being holden ouer the vapor or dampe of water wherein Mallowes, Hollihock rootes, Violet leaues, and Beare foote is sodden. Of the Fistula and Canker in the Arsegut. §. 12. THis infirmity commeth very sodainly into the Arsegut, and albeit it hath béene accustomed (like as in other the like diseases in the body) to vse incision or an actuall cautery: notwithstanding in this place it must be vtterly omitted, that there be no sinewes hurt. For it might easily thereby befall, that the patient af∣terwards should neuer stay his ordure, but (against his will) to let his excre∣ments passe from him. The cause of these Fistulaes may be the bad healing of the disea∣ses in the Arsegut, be it of what cause soeuer it may procéede. In like manner also through vsing of the Pyles badly, or any other impostume that hath not béen opened in time, but that the matter was left to stinke or putrifie therein, all which may cause fistulaes, as is aboue said; amongst the which there are some that penetrate the Arsegut, others the necke of the blad∣der, and some that remaine alwayes at a stay. These are hereby discerned, that either the vrin, the ordure, or winds passe through the Fistula. Also if the Muscles be therewith infected, then can he not retaine or stay his excrements, but as soone as it descendeth to this place it passeth from him. If then these Fistulaes be moyst and matterie, and the matter sharpe and stinking, and waxeth from day to day bigger, then it is a signe of a depascent Fistula, for the which strong remedies must be vsed to stay the same, that they corrode not déeper: for it hapneth otherwhiles that these depascent vlcers will consume the whole buttocks and all parts adiacent, and bring a body at the last after many miseries to his liues end. But if so be that this Fistula corrode no deeper, then must the same be cured with drying things, so that for a while they neither runne nor swell any more: but if so be the matter come to runne againe, then must be done as be∣fore, and that so long as one liueth. As concerning then the curing of this Fistula, it must al∣wayes be looked to, that the hole be kept open, which may best be effected with the pith of an Alder trée, dryed Gentian rootes, or Briony rootes: afterwards you must vse those things that are set downe in the first part, the eight Chapter, and 11. §. and also afterwards of the Fi∣stula of the eies. Some do commend two or thrée drops of oile of Sulphure to be iniected into the Arsegut, which will haue a wonderfull operation; and if so be that there follow any inflam∣mation, that it should be delayed with the white of an Egge, or fresh Butter. Fistulaes and such like vlcers, are to be washed with Rosemary wine, for it clenseth and keepeth the vlcers cleane, but of this Fistula will we intreate further hereafter in the fift part.
Of the itch in the Arse-gut. §. 13. THe causes of the itch in the Arsegut are foure: First, that there remaines some∣what that is sweatie or saltish in the fundament, which causeth the same: Se∣condly, through the wormes Ascarides, that haue their being in the end of the Arsegutte: Thirdly, some kind of vlcers that are in the lower part of the gute: Fourthly, sharp humors, as it oftentimes hapneth thorow some vncleanenesse that resteth in the Arsegut, and then must the Arsegut be washed with warme water, & be cleansed with clothes or wolblade leaues. But if the same come thorough the smal wormes, then take a sharpe Clister, yet not aboue eight ounces in quantitie: also dippe wooll or any such like thing in soft Pitch or Turpentine, then do the wormes sticke fast thereon; besides, the Pitch doth kill the wormes by nature: or annoint a great taint with Bird lime, and bind it on a thred that it may be drawne out againe. You may also sée in this present part what hath bene written for the wormes, but if the same be caused through any vlcers, then vse for it the white salue and others moe: but keepe the vlcers alwaies cleane and drie with fresh cloathes, wash the same oftentimes with water wherein Agrimonie, Oliue leaues, and such like are de∣cocted, put also burnt Allume thereto, and plume Allume, and bind clothes ouer it, and kéepe your selfe quiet. But if this itch procéed of a sharp matter, then vse Suppositories with Opium, Clisters, and others, as shall appeare hereafter for the laske or loosenesse of the bodie. The eleuenth Chapter. Of the inward members of the third part. IN the beginning of the third part of this our booke of practise, we haue giuen to vnderstand, how that therein are contained the Stomacke, the Liuer, the Gall, the Kidneys, the Bladder, the Bowels, and in women the Mother or womb; but because we haue hitherto treated of the out∣ward parts and their accidents, therefore will we now discourse orderly of the inward members; and first we will begin with the Stomacke, for that the same is couered with the Liuer, and lyeth on the top thereof: for it hath not onely his beginning at the mouth of the stomacke, but is also the meate roome or kitchin of all the other members, and therefore will we (and that by good reason) place it before. Of the Stomacke in generall. §. 1. VNder the Diaphragma or Midriffe, betwéene the Liuer and the Gall on the right side, and the Milt on the left side, that is, right in the midst of the body, yet a little more on the left side, there lyeth the stomacke, that is so ordained by nature, for that the Liuer might kéepe roome and scope. The Stomacke is cal∣led of the Gréeks Gaster, Cola, and sometimes also (although vniustly) Stoma∣chus, and of the Latinists Ventriculus. It is ordained for a receiuer of the meate, to dresse the same, and afterwards, like as out of a Cubbord, to impart all that is cooked, to each member his due, & that might suffise for his sustentation and nourishment, and to send out all that is vncleane or not fit for the nourishment, thorow the bowels and other naturall passages as a superfluitie. His substance is outwardly hard flesh, inwardly compacted full of veines, rough, and with many pleites or folds, whereby it draweth the meate vnto it. His forme is long, and round, hollow within, and like a Tunne, to let passe easily that is receiued, wide be∣neath, and neare the mouth of the Stomacke (which is properly called Stomachus, Oesophagus, and by the Arabians Meri) it is narrow. In comparison of the bodies of beastes, it is not big, so that thereby it doth not much excéede the blind gut Intestinum cacum, and is otherwise not much vnlike to a dogs mawe. With the vppermost end of the Stomacke doth it receiue the meate, and with the lower end doth it let all that is digested fall into the bowels, from whence
all superfluities are cast out. Both these ends of the stomacke, below and aboue, after that the meate is receiued, do shut vp most wonderfully, lest that the concocting and digesting warmth should vanish away. For if in the mouth of the stomacke there were not such closing, then could not the meate be well digested: whereby then must insue a noysome vapour, and a diminishing of naturall heate. So happeneth also of the lower passage of the stomacke, when as it, after the meate is receiued, will not be shut vp, a bad digestion and other diseases, as the fluxe, &c. whereof we will hereafter speake more at large. But thus much we would write in generall of the stomacke: Now will we procéede forward with particular things. Of the necke and mouth of the stomacke. §. 2. THis passage, through which the meate and the drinke descendeth out of the mouth into the stomacke, is properly one péece of the same: therefore will we first write thereof, as of the beginning of the stomacke. The necke of the stomack is of the old Grecians, and now adayes called by all learned men Oesophagus, and vnrightly Stomachus, and of the Latinists Gula, the which we in English doe name properly the vpper part of the stomacke, the necke: and the neathermost part, the mouth of the stomacke, which lyeth right in the pit of the heart. So that both these parts haue some difference, and that by reason of their situation and for other causes moe, euen as also Galenus maketh two sundrie Chapters of them. These foresaid necke and mouth of the stomacke, are subiect to many diseases, be it out of heate, cold, drought, moisture, or of any compounded complexion. Also through the obstruction of those parts, whereby the meate is drawne into the stomacke. Item, through impostumes, vlcers, blowes, wounds, and other inconueniences, all which may hinder the swallowing, whereof much is written in the second part, the first Chapter, §. 5. But we will here onely rehearse somewhat of the signes, and their difference. When as now then the whole necke hath any disease, then can the meate not be but slowly swallowed. But if the disease be in a certaine place of the necke, then remaineth the meate sticking in the same place. But whether it come of heate or drought, that shall be bewrayed by the drouth and thirst, for that cold water is very acceptable vnto him. But if so be it procéede of cold, then hath the patient neither heate nor thirst, but onely an anguish in the throate. If so be that one can hardly swallow through excessiue moisture, then doth the same appeare through much spettle and whitenesse of the tongue. Or the same cometh through drought, that maketh the drought of the tongue and the mouth knowne, for the patient wil drink continually, or wash his mouth with cold water. If there be any impostume in these places, then haue you the signes of Squi∣nancie therewith: wherof we in the second part, the first chapter, the 4. §. haue mentioned. Also when he would drinke, then runneth the drinke out of the nose: neither can he addict himselfe to lie, but séeketh alwaies to sit vp. Then cometh this disease through bloud Cholera, that may be knowne by the pricking paine, also by the thirst, heate and Ague: and to the contrarie, when the same is caused through cold, then is the paine small, but with drought and the painefulnes of swallowing is felt in moe places then in the place of the tumor. But if this impostume break out, then do they cast vp matter, and are very prone to vomiting, whereby also they lose their paine in swallowing. These impostumes are also to be knowne, if that one do swallow down, Vineger or any other soure thing, or that is salt, not onely into the necke of the stomake, but also euen into the shoulder blade. Or if the same be caused through any cricke of the necke, then will the paine also be knowne there: or there groweth a bunch either before or behind. And if so be that the same be caused through the crampe, then shut to the patients mouth: and he shall féele the paine most of all in the Nipples, and on the breast. But before that we come to the remedies for this infirmitie of swallowing, we must pre∣scribe some common rules: and first, because that the necke and mouth of the stomacke are ten∣der parts, therfore héede must be taken that there be not vsed for it any sharpe or biting things, that thereby they be not grieued nor hindred in their actions. Secondly, if these parts do ranc∣kle, or get any maladie (like as often hapneth) then must all sharpe, sower and biting things he
eschued, vnlesse the same things be drying withall, yet very little, because such sharp things do augment the same paine, do feeble the naturall power, and enflame the whole throate. Third∣ly, if so be that the necke of the stomacke be ouer cold, then must plaisters be laid vpon the shoul∣ders, and there about. But if this coldnes be in the mouth of the stomacke, then must the plai∣sters & other things be layd vpon the pit of the hart. Fourthly, if there be a hot impostume with paine and a cholerick body, then must he be let blood, purge, and vse other remedies, euen as hath béen said in the description of ye Squinancie. Fiftly, the remedies that are to be vsed for the healing of the exulceration of the throate, and to incarnate, they are alwaies to be tempered with some tough slimie thing, to the end that they may cleaue the faster in the throate, and thereby also may haue the better operation. Now to come to the remedies: If that this impediment be only caused through heate, or heate and drought, then purge the patient with sower Dates, Cassia, and Manna tempered in some broth, wherein Prunes, Violets, and Figs haue bin sodden; for all these things do expell such matter, and moysten the throate and the necke of the stomacke, like as in this disease is re∣quired. Therefore shall the patient (and that oftentimes) vse sirupe of Violets, water Lillies, and such like, and swallow the same leysurely. There may also be made a sirupe of Prunes as hereafter followeth: take fower or fiue Da∣maske Prunes, Violets two ounces, séeds of Lettice, Endiue, small Endiue, Purslaine, of each halfe an ounce, Sugar 18. ounces, make a sirupe thereof, like as before in the Introduction is taught. Beneath vnder the neck betwéene the shoulder blades there must the patient be annointed with cooling oyles, or any such like plaisters laid thereon, that are tempered with oyle of Vio∣lets, water Lillies, and oyle of Roses: afterwards take wheate meale thrée ounces, the musci∣lage of Fleawort, iuice of Housléeke, of each one ounce and a halfe, iuice of Purslaine one ounce, stampe them togither vnto a plaister. Take the iuice of great and small Housléeke, Rose water, of each two ounces, Melon séede, Lettice, Gourds, Cucumbers, Purslaine, and both kinds of Endiues, of each one quarter of an ounce: let this séeth al together vnto a plaister, then stamp them to growt, and vse it as aboue. If there be no drought thereby perceiued, then may be put thereto red and white Saunders and Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, and one ounce of Vineger. But if there be great drought therwith, then vse the muscilage of Fleawort, Dragagant, the séeds of Quinces, Violets, and such like: also he must eate cold herbs (whereof the seeds are here aboue named) fried with Butter, and annoynt himselfe outwardly with all manner of beasts marrow. In like maner are also very good for him conserues of Roses, the cold losinges of Dragagant, and Diapenidion without spices, and new rere egs. These ensuing pils are also to be prepared, and to hold them continually in the mouth, and lastly, swallow them downe: Take Dragagant, Gum of Arabia, Purslaine séede, Mallowes, and Quince kernels, of each one quarter of an ounce, Licorice one dragme and an halfe, the gum of Cherry trée a dragme, make thereof flat pils: Barley water and Buttermilke are good drinke for this sicknes, also he may drinke watred wine. But if this impediment be caused through cold (like as most commonly hapneth) and if so be that néede require, then giue to the patient some potions of Sirupo de Prssio, de Calaminta, or de Hyssopo, and purge him with Diaturbith, or Hiera logodion, and if it be néedfull put a little Esula to it. These tabulates shall he also hold in his mouth, and then swallow downe the iuice of them, to wit, Dianison, Diatrionpiperion, Diaireos Salomonis, Diapliris made with Muske, and such like. Vpon the shoulders must he be annoynted with the oyle of Costus, or with the oyle of Rue. For this is also good the salues Martiaton, Agrippae, and Altheae, whereupon this plaister fol∣lowing is to be applied: Take Laudanum, the fat of Shéepes wooll, Galbanum and Ammoniacum, of each one ounce, dryed Mints, Sage, Indy Spica, Spica Romana, and Cloues, of each one drag. Waxe one ounce, oyle of Spikenard as much as is néedfull to make a plaister, spread it ouer a cloth halfe a quarter of a yard, in compas fowre square, then draw it ouer with Syndall, and lay it after the length from the neck to the ridge of the backe. Amongst other Medicines may also those be vsed, that shall against a cold stomacke be de∣scribed
hereafter, whence is to be taken also an order of life. If that then this impediment in swallowing be caused through excessiue moysture, then i the first described order to be obserued: but that is not néedfull to expell such excesse of matter, but to kéepe a sober diet in eating & drinking: further, he must vse this gargarisme following. Take Cypers nuts, and the leaues, of each one handfull, Frankinsence and his rines, one ounce of each, burnt Allume three quarters of an ounce, plume Allume halfe an ounce; séethe this in a quart of Wine, and gargarise herewith, afterwards wash cleane the mouth, but swallow it not downe: or he shall vse all that in the first part, the thirtéenth Chapter, and 6. §. is taught, of the swelling of the toong. If then a hote or cold impostume, or the Squinancie be approching, then rule you like as it is shewed in the second part, the first Chapter, and 4. §. of the Squinancie: now we will goe forward with the Stomacke. To preserue and keepe a good digestion of the Stomacke. §. 3. HOw much the health of man is sustained through a well digesting stomacke, is sufficiently knowne to all the world: and it is also very true, that if the same receiue no wholesome meate, it cannot digest it well, the which appeareth in the disease of the stomacke, that all meates must corrupt, the which may eui∣dently be discerned through the sicknes that shall hereafter follow. Therefore it is first requisite and necessarie to prescribe a rule, how to kéepe this good digestion in her full efficacie. And although in all places hereafter, whereas shall be discoursed of any of the infirmities of the Stomacke, it shall be taught what shall be eschued or vsed: notwithstanding, it cannot be but auayleable briefely to comprehend the same in these ten rules. The first is, of the motion of the bodie, which (as followeth) is much commended. The motion of the bodie is a preseruation of a mans life, a quickning of naturall heate, and an excitation of sluggish nature, a digesture of all superfluous humors, a strengthning of all the members, an ouerthrowe of the diseases, a medicine for all anguishes, a gayning of time, re∣newing of youth, of mirth, of old age, a pleasure, a help of health and blessednes, an end of all in∣firmities, an enemy of sloth and lithernes, therefore do they feare and shun all labour, that will want mirth, and if any body desire not euery day to eate he may keepe himselfe from all labour. This motion is most commodious for sober folks before both mealetides, if they moue not aboue their might: for when one beginneth to be weary, then must he rest, and each one must exercise and stirre according to the abilitie of his bodie. The men of occupations haue exerci∣ses ynough about their occupations; but if any one at any mealetide haue surfetted, then must he fast the next day, and vse temperate motions, to consume all superfluitie through abstinence and exercise. All people that haue great exercise, may much better digest grosse meates, then they that are idle and liue at ease, whereby may easily be discerned the vertue of motion. The second is of the propertie of meates, that they be not too hote of nature, or too cold, whereby they may not inflame the naturall heate, or might ouercoole it, the which is also to be vnderstood of all other qualities of meates. Secondly, prouidence must be had that all meates be well boyled, sod, and rosted, otherwise can the stomacke not digest it as it behooueth. Thirdly, binding things eaten before other meates, they binde the body, like as if they be eaten after the same, they loose, & are laxatiue. Fourthly, light meates are, Barley well sodden, well baked bread, small Fishes, Partridges, Phesants, and such like. Fiftly, meates that are acceptable to nature, will be the more willingly receiued by the stomacke, and also digested. But this is only to be vnderstood of healthfull persons, and of them that vse the same mode∣rately: otherwise, that is not alwayes good which is pleasant to the mouth. Sixtly, although the subtile & light meates do lesse molest digestion, and are requisite for health, yet are they ne∣uerthelesse nothing the stronger or apter for labor, therefore they passe all others herein, that féede on grosse meates. Seuenthly, would or might any one not eate such healthy meates alto∣gether? then is he notwithstanding to do the contrary as seldome as he may, tempering with some wholesome meates, like as men do pepper & wine with Mushrimps, and Spices or Gar∣lick with Fish, &c. Eightly, slimie meates tarry long in the stomacke, before that they passe
into the bowels. Bread with his bran goeth much sooner into the bowels, than where the bran is boulted out. Ninthly, flesh broyled on the gridiron giueth good nourishment when it is dige∣sted: but it goeth slowly towards the guts. Tenthly, Pullet broths do delay the humors more than Hen broth, yea and giue much more nourishment. The third rule dependeth on the quantitie of the meates, whereof too much must not be ta∣ken in least they make some griefe or winde in the body. Secondly, much meates do not moy∣sten throughly, but only those that be without sharpnesse, sowernesse, saltnesse, and bitternesse. Thirdly, when any body hath taken much meate and drinke, and thereby findeth some weake∣nesse or drought in the stomacke, he shall then the other day afterwards fast, and sleepe the more in a temperate place. Fourthly, a haile man shall take euen so much meate, as shall not gréeue him. Fiftly, all they that liue lasciuiously and riotously, do die before their old age. Sixtly, great bodies haue néede of more meate and drinke than small bodies: they require also more heate and vitall spirits for their sustentation. Seuenthly, much and many meates taken at one time be preiudiciall two manner of waies: first, by reason of the variable digesture, as when light meates are mingled with grosse meates: secondly, for that it is seene, that there is more eaten of that which is pleasant in taste, than with moderate feeding would suffice. The fourth rule containeth a good diet, whereby the meate is not to be tempered with the medicine, for that it were an vnméete cost, when as the séeds of wild Saffron, Nettles or wild Time should be mingled amongst meate, that spoyle the meate, hurt digesture, and driue it into the bowels before the body haue his nourishment out of it. Secondly, grosse and hard meates are to be eaten alwaies at the first, and afterwards the light meates. Thirdly, if one do eate milde and moyst things at the first, and then afterwards hard meates, then do the light meates run quickly through the stomacke, and leade the hard grosse meates away with them vndigested. Fourthly, all they that be loose of body, are to take at the beginning of their meale tides binding things and spices: and if not, then are they al∣waies first to take that which will quickly passe through the stomacke, and leade the way to other meates. To this end are Melons, Peaches, and other fruites to be eaten before one eate bread or flesh: for that when as they which be harder do hinder the passage, then is the digestion spoy∣led, and so it is with all other kinds of meates. Fiftly, meates which be of this nature that they do not easily passe through, or without requisite digestion, then must the grosse meates be first taken, and the light meates last of all: as Mutton before Birds, and Beefe before Mutton. For the bottome of the stomacke by reason of his heate, hath more force to digest the grosse meates first, than the top or vpper part of the stomacke. Sixtly, milke and sower things are not to be eaten aboue once, for that the milke runneth into the stomacke, whereby the digestion is hin∣dered. Seuenthly, Butter, milke, and Radishes, are not méete togither, nor yet with any birds: for the birds hauing subtile flesh, wil be spoyled through the sharpnes of the Radishes. Eightly, sodden wheate in flesh broth or in water, is not to be vsed after Rice, for that both of them be of grosse nourishment, and do obstruct the waies. Ninthly, Vineger, Oyle, and all manner of fat∣nesse are not at any hand to be kept in Copper vessels, for that they do draw the venemous nature of the Copper vnto them. The fift rule containeth the time, that in the winter and spring more meate is behoouefull than in the sommer: for that then the stomacke is at the very hottest. Secondly, that there be nothing eaten vntill the former be digested. Thirdly, in the winter, things be not tolerable to be eaten which do little nourish, as herbs, and such like, but compact and strong meates are to be vsed, which be long in digesting. Fourthly, in sommer is the most fit time to eate before the heate commeth, and in euening when the heate is past. Fiftly, in the spring is one to eate but little at dinner, and in sommer nothing at all. In the haruest fruites do bring many sicknesses with them: but in the winter one may eate his fill. The sixt rule prescribeth a diet for euery complexion. First, he is not to forbeare meate which is hot & drie of nature: for there is nothing more hurtfull vnto him than abstinence. Second∣ly, for to preserue & kéepe a good digestion, those meates are to be vsed which do best agree with euery ones complexion: to wit, if any be warme by nature, that he then féede vpon méetely warme meate, and so the like for drie and moyst bodies. Thirdly, if so be that heate do increase in any one, then must coole things be takē for it. Fourthly, a melancholike man must féede vpon
moyst things and somewhat warme: A cholericke body cold and moyst meates. Fiftly, all that be hot and drie of nature, and do much exercise, for them are all light and subtile meates very hurtfull. The seuenth rule doth yéeld a reason of repletion & inanition, whereof is first to be marked, that how much the more you feede an vncleane body, so much the more doth the same annoy and hurt it: for when the meate is mixed with the corrupted humors it is then also corrupted: the same happeneth also vnto them who haue the stomacke full of bad humors. Secondly, no man ought so to ouercharge himselfe with meate, but that he might féele still some hunger. Thirdly, when one hath filled himselfe well the one day, although he might the next day feele some hunger, yet is he the next day to forbeare as much as is possible, and to sléepe in a tempe∣rate place. Fourthly, when any accustometh to eate flesh and to drinke wine, and doth not l∣bour at all, the same person (to the end he may be discharged) is the oftener to be let blood. Fiftly, there is nothing woorse than when one hath fed on strong meates, before they be digested to eate againe: for when as the one meate commeth to the other vndigested then do they both spoyle. Sixtly, all they who after dinner take their supper vpon it, must then fast out the same. Seuenthly, all that do liue soberly, and after much eating and drinking do fast againe, they liue the longer. Eightly, all rioters and great drinkers must sometimes force themselues to vomit, and betake themselues therewith for to fast it out, and to sléepe a day times. The eight rule comprehendeth the drinks: which first are not to be vsed so much that the meate come not to swim in the stomacke, for thereby will the digestion of the stomacke be spoy∣led. Secondly, albeit some be of opinion, that mē ought not to drinke to their meate, yet do they speake against all skill; therefore be they not to be heard. For one ought to drinke, that the na∣turall heate be not aggrauated. Thirdly, when he féeleth good thirst, and when as the heate of the stomacke requireth the same, the which neuer happeneth to such as be haile but when they do either eate or do great labour, and after a long Easterly winde. Fourthly, all sharp, new, grosse and swéete wines, likewise, all they which are kept in Sulphured caskes, and also all Must ought to be eschewed if so be that they be not vsed for medicine. White, cléere, thin, red & pallet wine which is not troubled, and of a good taste, drunken moderately, is very healthie: but to water them much is very noysome, bicause that thereby is made gripings in the belly, windinesse in the stomacke, tumor in the milts, and spoyleth the digesting of the stomacke. The ninth rule is of the customes. First, all they that be woont or accustomed to eate much, and that of all manner of grosse meates, shall not only altogither relie on the strength of their stomack: for they shall not be able to escape the harme which they shall féele thereby in time to come, bicause that thereby bad humors are increased in the body by little and little. Secondly, the custome of eating once or twise a day, and if that thereby men remaine healthie, it is not good to alter it: for that custome (as is woont to be said) is nature it selfe. Thirdly, good and tole∣rable custome is to be continued. Notwithstanding, if one were woont to be drunke euery day, or to drinke in the morning fasting, who is it that can commend the same? Euen so is sobrietie to be adiudged of, and fasting. It is also to be vnderstood, that all they who be woont to eate twise a day, and would accustome themselues to eate but once a day, that the same might cause some inconuenience vnto them, and so to the contrarie: for the stomacke cannot tolerate it. Fiftly, all they that vse to eate at a certaine hower, and should suddenly alter it, do stand in danger that the same will not prosper well. Sixtly, although that the accustomed meate and drinke be such that it be not much to be commended: notwithstanding it ought not slightly to be changed into other meates and drinks which be taken to be healthier. The tenth rule requireth the dressing of meates: to wit, that each meate be boyled, rosted and drest as it ought to be, so that the stomacke get no loathing thereby, and the same meate may the better be digested. Thirdly, delicate sawces for each meate in particular prouoketh one to eate more than is good for him: therefore they ought to be omitted and forborne. Fourthly, stinking and putrified meates, be it fruit, flesh, fish, or whatsoeuer else, howsoeuer they be drest, can bring none other but badnes with them. Hereof is now sufficiently spoken for the preseruation of good digestion, and how the bad di∣gestion of the stomacke is to be amended. For that what might faile therein, these sicknesses following sufficiently do declare.
Of the debilitie of the stomacke in generall. §. 4. OF these debilities or infirmities of the stomacke there be thrée principall acci∣dents vnder which are all other comprehended. The first the Grecians do call Bradypepsian, which is slowe digestion. The second Apepsian, which is when the stomacke cannot digest. The third Dyspepsian, which is when the di∣gestion is vtterly spoyled, and the meates do turne into bad humors, which is when the stomacke is wholy weakened and departed from his natural actions, and hath lost the same: which default may be prouoked through inward and outward causes: the outward causes be the motions of the minde, as anger, care, sorrow, rough windes, and grosse meates which be hard of digestion; as old beefe, hard, old, and vnleauened bread, Hasell nuts, old Chéese, cold herbs and fruites whereof hath beene vsed much a long time, as Gourds, Melons, Mushromes and Apples &c. Item all excesse, windy meates and drinks, pottages, Mustes, and all ouermuch watered wine, or water dronken alone (if it be not in great heate) and to eate before the former meate be digested. Item, blowes or fals in and about the stomacke, bathing in very hot or cold times: also in∣ward and outward heate and cold of nature, great exercise, extreme venerie which inféelth much and weakeneth the naturall powers. Likewise ouermuch sleepe and rest: also to study too much, and straight after meate. The inward maladies of the stomacke be these; ouer great heate, cold, drought, moisture, windes, impostumes, and such like: Also through the infirmities of other parts; as if out of the braines there do fall any rheumes into the stomacke, or when the hart beateth, the liuer is ob∣structed with any cholericke humors, the Milt with melancholicke humors, and the stomacke is too much ouer charged. When as then the property of each member is weighed, then may easily be discerned what annoyeth the stomacke. If then the debility of the stomack be caused through heat, that is to be knowen by the sto∣macke: also there is euermore thirst with it, and all cold things are welcome to the patient, and hot things are loathsome. Or if this debilitie do come through any slimines, then is there heauynes in the stomacke, drought, bitternes, and wambling. When as this procéedeth of cold, that may the stomacke finde: for that the thirst is small, the digestion little, and no desire of meate: warmth is wel∣come, but cold is tedious vnto him. If it be of phlegme, it is knowen by drowsines, swel∣ling, much spettle, quicke passage of the meate through the body, and almost after the maner of one that hath taken somewhat he doth belch with a sowre taste, & such like. But if this infirmi∣tie of the stomacke do come of any melancholy, then is there also drought, heauines, and wam∣bling with it, the téeth will be loose, the patient will be plagued with vnnaturall lust of eating, the Milt doth swell whereof great heauines doth follow of the minde. If so be that the same be caused through drought, then insueth great thirst thereby, drought of the toong, binding in the bodie, vnlustines, and harme through drie meates. If it be caused through moysture, then is there litle thirst with it, but loathsomnes of all moisture; all drought doth good to the pa∣tient, and there is much spetting with it. Or if these humors be mixed, that is easily to be per∣ceiued through the signes aforesaid; like as euery accidēt bringeth with it a proper description. But before we come to any particularities, we will here discouer one thing, which is so re∣nowned that it can preserue the stomacke from all diseases, and suffereth nothing to putrifie therein, because it expelleth all humidity and vncleannes from the stomacke, and clenseth the same: they which vse it often get neuer any more paine in the stomacke: it causeth mirth, it strengtheneth the hart and head, it clenseth also the raines and the wombe excéedingly: which are the pils of Amber called de Succino, which are thus prepared:Pils of Am∣ber. Take the white or other Am∣ber and Masticke, of each one quarter of an ounce, Aloe fiue dragmes, Agaricus one dragme and a halfe, right Aristology halfe a drag. this being all beaten small and tempered with the sirupe of Wormewood, make thereof a masse of pils, and forme seuen pils of one drag. Take alwaies two or three of them when you go to bed.
Of a weake stomacke through cold. §. 5. FIrst this is to be noted, that (to speake naturally) the stomacke in the summer and in the haruest is coldest of all, and that by reason that the heate is drawen into the outward members, and therefore is so much the weaker about the sto∣macke. Contrariwise (as we haue mentioned before) the stomacke in the win∣ter and spring time is hottest of all, because the outward cold driueth the heate inward: and therefore then people are to eate so much the more. For in the debilitie of the stomack regard must be had of the times. Now for to write of the coldnes of the stomack, so it is, that (besides all the foresaid signes) the meate will scarse settle it selfe in the bottome of the stomacke, so that the same otherwhiles after the patient hath taken it, hath no rest ere and before he hath vomited out the same againe vndigested: and although it be digested, yet happeneth it slowly. Also if one féele with the hand thereon outwardly, then may it be per∣ceiued to be cold there: It is also full of winde which is expelled vpwards and downewards. There be yet moe other signes herebefore rehersed of a cold stomacke: When as then the cold of the stomacke is small and of no continuance, then is the patient euery morning to take Tro∣ciscos de Rosis two or thrée dragmes in an ounce of Miua cydoniorum wherein Comin and Ameos be boyled. Trocisces of Roses.The aforesaid Trocisci are thus to be prepared: Take Roses thrée dragmes, Lignum Aloes, Masticke, Indie Spica, Cassy wood, Squinanth and Wormewood, of each one drag. beaten alto∣gither small, and tempered with old wine, and then formed. These Trocisci are very good taken with halfe an ounce of the spirit of wine. They are also to be fed with light meates, which haue but little moysture and superfluitie: Also their meate must be strewed with Galingall, Pepper, Ginger, Cloues, Ameos, and such like. Before meate the patient is to exercise himselfe well: they that vse this water, must alwaies drink more thereof after meate than before. After meate he must sléepe much, & drink neate old Renish wine; but eate lesse than he was woont, for the weaknes of the stomacke cannot digest much meate. Meates which be requisite for him are Muttons, Kids, Hens, Pullets, fowles, Partridges, Fesants, Pigeons, Quailes, and such like; yet rather rosted than boyled and drest with spice: also rere egs and such like. But if this weaknes of the stomacke hath long continu∣ed, then may be vsed one of these Sugar plates following (which one will) one quarter of an ounce or more at once. Or if so be that it be made after the maner of a conserue, then to take one ounce at a time daily with wine: viz. Diatrion Pipereon, Diagalanga, Dianison, Diamentha, Caryo∣philatum, Rosata nouella, Diacyminum, Diaolibanum, also the warme Dragagant cakes, the which also do strengthen the stomack and procure digestion. But especially is the Confection Diacina∣momum commended for a blessed medicine for all moyst, bad, and spoiled stomacks, as that con∣sumeth all superfluous humiditie, helpeth digestion, and strengtheneth the eyesight, therefore be there two sorts here described. Confectio Diacinamomi. Diacinamo∣mum.TAke of the most purest Cinnamom fiftéene drag. grosse Cinnamom, Comin, and Elecam∣pane, of each halfe an ounce, Galingall seuen drag. Cloues, long Pepper, Cardamomum, Greines, Ginger, Lignum Aloes, Mace and Nutmegs, of each thrée drag. Saffron one drag. white Sugar fiue drag. When you will make Tabulats thereof, then take one pound of Sugar, one ounce and a quarter of the foresaid spices, and séeth the Sugar in Wormewood water as behooueth. Another with Rubarbe. Take excellent Rubarbe one quarter of an ounce, Angelica, Rapontica, of each halfe a drag. Cinnamom thrée drag. Nutmegs one drag. and a halfe, Cardamome, long Pepper, white Dip∣tamus, and Zeduary, of each halfe a drag. Galingall two scruples, Calmus halfe a drag. Ginger two scruples, Pimpernell rootes, Masticke and Cucubes, of each one scrup. Saffron ten grains, Sugar eight ounces, boyle the Sugar with Wormewood water, and cast a plate of Sugar of it.
In like manner is the confection of Aromaticum rosatum not only commended for the debili∣tie of the stomack, but also for many other diseases, like as here and there the same be discoue∣red, for which purpose it is also prepared after sundry sorts, like as be some héere expressed. Confectio Aromatici rosati. TAke fifteene dragmes of red Roses, Licorice seuen dragmes, Lignum Aloes and yellow Saunders, of each thrée dragmes, Cinnamome, Mace, Cloues, of each two drag. and a halfe, Gummi Arabicum, and Dragagant, of each one quarter of an ounce, Nutmegs, Cardamome, Galingall, of each one dragme, Muske one scruple, Indie Spica, and Amber, two scruples, temper them all together: and if you will then cast a plate of Sugar of it, take one ounce of these Species, and twelue ounces of Sugar, decoct them in Rose water as is accusto∣med. Thus is this confection at the Apothecaries made, and not only for his pleasantnes, but also for his commodiousnes vsed daily; for that besides that it doth strengthen the weake sto∣macke, and comforteth the hart, the braines, the head, and the Liuer; it driueth out also the b and superfluous humors of the stomacke: it helpeth the digestion of the stomacke, and especi∣ally in them which be a foote againe after a long continued and lingring sicknes. Another which is common at Augusta Vindelicorum. TAke Roses one ounce, Licorice thrée dragmes, Cinnamome two dragmes and a halfe, Cloues, Mace, of each one dragme and ten graines, red Corall, Cardamome, Galingall, of each halfe a dragme, Spec. Diarrhodon Abbatis one scruple, Indie Spica, long Pepper, of each ten graines, Lignum Aloes one dragme and a halfe, Greynes eight graines, shauen Iuorie one dragme, Gum, Dragagant, of each thrée scruples and a halfe, Nutmegs 2. scruples, Muske ten graines, Amber one scruple, make a subtle pouder thereof. Or if you will haue Su∣gar plates of it, then do as before. Item, take beaten Calmus halfe an ounce, the iuice of Wormewood as much as is néedfull to make plates of Sugar: and if you desire to haue this strong, then séeth it in Wine, and giue it him at two or thrée times. Or take Cinnamome one quarter of an ounce, Ginger, Nutmegs, Cardamome, Galingall, Cloues, of each one dragme, Mace, Lignum Aloes, of each halfe a dragme, Annis one dragme, the skins of Hens mawes washed with Wine and dryed, thrée dragmes, white Sugar 34. ounces: séeth the Sugar in good Wine, and thereof cast Sugar plates. Another. TAke Cinnamome thrée dragms, Galingall one dragme, Sugar sixe ounces, but boyle the Sugar with one ounce of Rose water, this Confection doth make also good appetite to meate. In like manner you haue also in the first part the twelfth Chapter, and 12. §. a confection Diamargariton calidum which is very good for this. Item, take Ginger one dragme, Cloues and Galingall, of each halfe a drag. Pepper, prepared Coriander, of each one scruple, Annis, Fennell, Ameos, Spicanardi, Cardamome, of each thrée scruples and a halfe, confected Citron pils one ounce, Rose water one ounce and a halfe, Licorice halfe a dragme, Sugarcandie halfe an ounce, Currans one ounce: powne all that is to be powned, but chop the Citron pils and Currans very small, then seeth the Sugarcandie, and ten ounces of white Sugar with Rose water, and so make tabulats thereof. Confected Annis seeds are also very good for all debilitie of the stomacke, it helpeth digesture, it expelleth the paine and winde of the stomacke, the same doth Fennell séed also. But there is yet a better for this, to wit, confected Comin and Caruway seed, for that the same haue also power to warme the stomacke. Certaine Powders for meate. TAke prepared Coriander, and Cinnamome, of each halfe an ounce, long, white, and black Pepper, Cloues, Galingall, and Ginger, of each one dragme and a halfe, Annis, Fennell,
of each thrée dragmes, Saffron one dragme, Sugar as much as all the rest; make a powder thereof, or a confection, which you had rather haue. Item, take Cinnamome, Mace, Cloues, Pepper, Cypers rootes, of each alike much, Sugar as much as you please. Item, take Cinna∣mome two ounces, Nutmegs one dragme, prepared Coriander séeds, Roses, red Corrall, of each one scruple, Sugar fowre ounces, temper them all together: it is of a temperate nature. For this may also things be vsed, which are described in Aromatico rosato, beaten to powder. Heere follow now certaine stomachicall medicines against all coldnes, windines, and humi∣dities of the stomack, and all other inward parts of the bodie: Take Annis, Fennell, and pre∣pared Coriander, of each one ounce, Caruway halfe an ounce, Licorice (beaten small) one ounce and a halfe, Ginger, Calmus, of each three dragmes, Galingall, Zeduary, of each one dragme and a halfe, Cloues one dragme, temper all together. One may take thereof euery morning the waight of two dragmes. Some do take the fowre séeds confected with Sugar: other do let them to be all together confected with Sugar, that it might be so much the more pleasant to take. Some temper a∣mongst it cut Cucumber rootes, because that they (besides all their vertues) cause the winds to depart, and dry vp bad humors. Item, take Licorice cut small one ounce, Galingall one quar∣ter of an ounce, Calmus halfe an ounce, Mace three dragmes, Cinnamome and Nutmegs, of each one dragme and a halfe, confected Annis seeds fowre ounces, Caruway, Fennell, prepa∣red and confected Coriander, of each two ounces: cut all that is to be cut, and temper all toge∣ther. Or take cut Licorice, prepared Coriander, Fennell, and Caruway, of each one quarter of an ounce, Gentian, Calmus, and Ginger, of each three dragmes, Pimpernell rootes or the séeds, and Rue seed, of each one dragme: cut all that is to be cut, and temper them all together, as before. These foresaid stomachicall compositions are very commodious for the common people, and also commodious for all the foresaid infirmities, but especially the Gentian doth expell all slime and venemous matter of the stomack. This is to be vsed in the morning on tosted bread, mollified or soke in Wine, and to fast thrée howres afterwards. In like manner you shall finde before in the first part the twelfth Chapter and first §. a good Medicine for the stomack, which may be well added vnto these: Calmus and Cinnamome tem∣pered together are also speciall good for this purpose. This Confection following is also highly commended for all féeble, cold, and moyst sto∣macks, as also for the strengthening of the Liuer, Milt, Hart, Braines, and whole bodie: it in∣creaseth Venerie, maketh fat and merrie, and is also good against the beating of the Hart. It is called Electuarium de Citro,Electuarium de Citro. or confection of Citrons: Take Citron pils, Zeduary, Doronicum, Amber, and red Corrall, of each one dragme, Silkewormes nests cut very small, red and white Behen, Lolium, Rosemary floures, and Calmus of each fiue dragmes, two Harts bones, and Perles two scruples, Rubies, Iacints, Smaragdes, Marierom gentle seeds, and Stechas floures, of each one scruple, small filed Gold and Siluer, Buglosse floures, Tormentill, red Sti∣rax, burnt Iuorie, Basill séed, and long Pepper, of each halfe a dragme, Muske and Amber, of each one scruple, dry Mints, & Mastick, of each two scruples and a halfe, conserue of Buglosse one ounce, white Sugar 18. ounces: séeth the Sugar méetly thicke in Buglosse water, and so make a confection thereof. Marmalade with spices (as hereafter in the last part it is described) is also commodious for this, for that it strengtheneth and warmeth the stomacke maruel∣lous well. Another. Take Ginger one dragme, Cloues, Galingall, and Cinnamome, of each halfe a drag. Zeduary, long Pepper, prepared Coriander, of each one scruple, Annis, Fennell, Ameos, Spikenard, Cardamome, and Mace, of each fiue graines, confected Citron pils, and Raisons (the stones taken out) of each one ounce, Sugar twelue ounces decocted in Rose water: cut and beate the Citron pils and Raisons, and temper the rest amongst them.

They are also good for a weake stomack, for that they dry and further the digestion of the stomack, if one take thereof one drag. in a draught of Wine. All confected things, as Rootes, Fruites, and all such like, which be warme of nature, are good for a cold stomack, as is confected Ginger, which not only warmeth the stomack, but also all inward parts, and doth restraine the vapors from ascending and drawing vp towards the head. Calmus is passing good for a cold stomack. Elecampane rootes also strengthen the stomack, helpe digestion, driue out all venimous humidities, and warme the same. Confected Nutmegs do consume all moysture of the inward members, they do warme and strengthen the stomack, and are good for the digestion of the same. The like do also confected Orange pils, Citron pils, rootes of Eringus, and Walnuts, all which be described in the last part of this our booke of Phi∣sicke. The herbs and floures which be warme by nature, are Eyebright, which is also very good against all Agues that be caused of putrifaction. Conserue of Betonie, and of Gillofloures do the like also, if that one take thereof halfe an ounce or more daily before meales. They do also stay the ascending vapors of the stomack, and strengthen the same. The like also doth con∣serue of Marierom, Hyssop, Piony, Sage, Lauender, Spikenard, and Rosemary. All aromaticall Wines are much commended for this, not only for the stomack, but also for all other parts to be vsed outwardly: They do also take away the insatiable hunger. Secondly, there can be thought no better thing for the stomack than good old strong wine for common drinke: But if the same cannot be had, then may be vsed in the stead thereof, some Meade, or Hony water. In like sort also Miua aromatica, and other sirupes moe, which shall be described hereafter. The rich and very daintie persons may also get Hippocras made, whereof you shall finde many kinds described in the eight part:Stelladia. especially this following called Stelladia is vsed much in Italy. Take Cinnamome, and Cloues, of each one drag. Pepper, Graines, and Galingall, of each one drag. and a halfe, Cardamome one drag. and a halfe, one quart of Wine, Sugar or Hony, as much as you please: make Hippocras thereof, as is taught in the eight part. Amongst the most vsed Wines made of Herbs, are these ensuing warme of nature, Wine of Eyebright cleanseth the stomack of all humiditie, withstandeth the Ague, and is of a tem∣perate nature. The Wine of Hyssop warmeth also the stomack, and all inward members. The like do also Rosemary wine, & Marierom wine, which also prouoke appetite. Asarabacca wine & Worme∣wood wine, are very good, especially if there be any Mastick decocted in the common wine. Be∣tonie wine & Gillofloure wine are very good against windines. The herbe Bennet wine and Clary wine, are also very good for this purpose. Item, take Must as much as you thinke good, let it worke fowre dayes one after another, then put therein a small bag, with the leaues of the right wilde Vine, and let them also worke togither as before, whereof will be a very pleasant wine. You haue the like before in the second part, the sixt Chapter, and 5. §. of the panting of the hart through cold, a spiced wine, beginning thus: Take Ginger two ounces, &c. What a ver∣tue also the Elecampane wine hath (which is very common) shall be amongst other discouered in the eight part. Héere haue you also some mo such like drinks for a proofe: Take sirupe of Mints one ounce, Cinnamome water thrée dragmes and a halfe, oyle of Cloues two drops, oyle of Vitrioll thrée drops, temper all together. The oyle of Vitrioll is very sharp and perilous, as is rehersed in the description thereof. Take water of Currans fower ounces, temper therein as much Saffron as the bignes of a Pease, drinke it lukewarme in the morning, likewise also after noone and after supper: it is especiall good against all paine of the stomack. The wine may also be tempered with Currans water. Item, séeth Wormwood in wine or water, and drinke it: it is very good for poore folks.
Item, in the second Part the fift Chapter and 5. §. you shall haue a pectorall water, begin∣ning: Take new Figs, &c. which also doth clense the stomacke from all excessiue humiditie. In like manner doth also a forcible Capon water in the second Part the sixt Chapter, and 4. §. which doth strengthen the stomacke and the hart maruellous mightily. Charuell water, Laks spur water mixed, or each apart, strengthen the stomacke. The vitall waters and other waters are very requisite also for this, whereof many be de∣scribed in the eight Part. Of sirupes which do strengthen the stomacke. Sirupe of Citron péeles doth strengthen and helpe digestion, sirupe of Wormwood doth make appetite, sirupe of Mints is good for all disea∣ses of the stomacke which proceede of cold, sirupe of Fumitorie helpeth all obstruction. Oxymel Compositum and of Squils be good to breake all tough slime. Ginger and Calmus stéeped in wine or vineger are also very good, if one eate a spoonefull thereof. Some do put Gentian rootes vnto it, for such as can away with bitternes. Also twice a day you may eate sixe or eight peeled Al∣monds, therewith to drie the stomacke, and euery third day once to eate a few water Cresses tempered with wine. Also if there be any new Figs to be had, then eate fower or fiue in the morning fasting. Amongst all these foresaid remedies there be many which may be vsed as well to the old, as the new diseases of the stomacke, like as each one may know for to rule himselfe thereafter. What then belongeth to the order of life we haue spoken thereof at the first: but if néede were (whether it be of superfluous moisture, binding the bodie, or other debilitie of the stomack) to purge, then must good héed be taken of such things as be contrarie to the stomacke, and might distemper it: to wit, wilde Saffron séed, Polypodie rootes, and séeds of Palma Christi, (which are enimies to the stomacke, and accounted but Quacksaluers remedies) but in this is prouidently to be dealt, and after the taking of some preparatiue potions, he is to vse the last mentioned Sirupes, or these insuing, and such like purgations. Take Hiera Picra one ounce, Turbith halfe a dragme, Ginger one scruple, and thrée ounces of the before mentioned wines. Make also a potion thereof: also there may be put into this a little Cinnamome for the tastes sake. Another. TAke of the Confection of Diacatholicon fiue dragmes, Diaphenicon two dragmes, sirupe of Ireos and Rubarbe, of each halfe a dragme, Spica two graines: both beaten small, tem∣per them with Decoctione Fructuum (which is described before in the third Chapter 5. §.) wherein some Spikenard is decocted.

Take Mirobalani Chebuli and Indi, Rubarbe, Cinnamome, Cardamome, Cloues, and Galingale, of each one dragme, Aloe one dragme and a halfe: these being beaten small togither, temper them with the iuice of Mints wherein Agaricus hath béene fower and twenty howers steeped: of these pils may one swallow two or thrée morning and euening, especially if the paine of the stomacke haue long endured. These following do strengthen and asswage the paine of the stomacke: Take Pillulae Alephanginae one dragme, Opij and Beuercod, of each one graine, make fiue pils thereof with Oxymel. Item, take washt Aloe one scruple, and make two pils thereof: take them one hower before meate, and especially before that he be purged. Pils which will not purge, but onely strengthen. TAke beaten Mastick and the iuice of Wormwood, of each a like quantitie, set it couered close in a warme place vntill it be drie, that one may make pils of it, whereof euery day two howers before noone, you may take one pill.

This foresaid plaister is not only good against all paines of the stomacke, but also for the bowels, for the liuer, kidneies, bladder, belly, & all other parts of the body, where is any paine through cold winds. And how much more Cypers rootes you put vnto it, so much the stronger do you make it to expell the winds, and especially it is very good for the dropsie called Tympanites, a Tympanie. Item, take Cloues, Masticke, Spica, Galingale and long Pepper, of each one quarter of an ounce, Waxe, Laudanum, Ammoniacum, of each one drag. oyle of Spikenard as much as sufficeth for a plaister.
Here followeth now all that is to be outwardly applyed vpon the Stomacke. TAke a great Onion and make it hollow, and put therein Saffron floures about one dragme and a halfe: this Onion must then be wound in wet towe, and afterwards ro∣sted in ashes. This being done, you are to make it cleane, and stamp it to pap: lay there∣of vpon a cloth the thicknes of a finger, and then lay it vpon the pit of the stomack, and as often as it is cold, take another againe which is warme. This is passing good for a cold stomack. Also you may séeth Masticke in Wine, and of this Wine must you lay vpon the stomack with a cloth, as warme as you can suffer it. Item, vnwashed Shéepes wooll kemmed must you let soke vpon thick red Wine, wherein is oyle of Spikenard, and so laid warme vpon the stomacke, the same taketh away the paine of the stomacke. Or stéepe the foresaid wooll in oyle of Mastick, oyle of Wormewood, or oyle of Spike, then wring it out, and so lay it very warme vpon the stomacke. Another. Take Ginger, Mints, Southernwood, Costus rootes, to wit, the swéete roote, Wormewood, wilde Thyme, and Mastick, of each halfe an ounce, Frankinsence one quarter of an ounce, Spikenard, Cloues, Lignum Aloes, Cassy wood, of each halfe a dragme: let all these séeth together in nine ounces of Sallad oyle and thrée ounces of good Wine, vntill the Wine be cleane consumed: afterwards straine it through a cloth, and then lay it vpon your stomack like as is before said. For this is also very good Pellitorie of the wall, with oyle of Spike, of Mastick fryed, one drag. of Saffron put thereto: likewise a Swallowes nest boyled in Wine, vntill it be cleane thorough mollified & dissolued, and so laid warme vpon the stomack. Or take water of Mints, Wormewood and Malmsey, of each sixe ounces, Cloues, Mints, Cinnamome, Lignum Aloes, Galingall, of each halfe a drag. temper them all together, and make a péece of felt wet therein, and so lay it warme vpon the stomack, like as is taught before. Item, carrie vpon the stomack a yong naked Child, or in stead of him a yong naked Dog: they do both of them warme the stomack, and strengthen the same. The same doth also a Cushion of fine feathers: likewise also a warme hand holden vpon the stomack. It is also found good to rub the stomack with vitall waters. One may also make a cloth wet therein, and so lay it warme vpon it. Bags to be laid vpon the Stomacke. TAke Mints, Wormewood, wilde Vine leaues, Rosemary, and Peniroyall, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cloues fowre scruples, Nutmegs, Mace, Masticke, of each two scruples, Galingall halfe a drag.

TAke oyle of Masticke, Wormewood, Spikenard, of each one ounce, Cloues, Masticke, Ameos, of each one drag. beate them well together, and make an oyntment thereof. Item, take oyle of Mastick, and of wormewood, of each one ounce, oyle of Mirtles halfe
an ounce, Cloues, Cinnamome and Galingall, of each halfe a drag. Lignum Aloes and Ginger, of each one scruple; make an oyntment of it with a little Vineger. Or take Roses fiue drag. Wormewood one quarter of an ounce, Spica one drag. Cloues two scruples, long Pepper halfe a drag.

And if it be in winter, and that the party must go abroade, then lay vpon the breast annoynted two or thrée leaues of writing paper, for it preserueth naturall heate, and defendeth the stomacke from all outward cold. Another: Take distilled oyle of Masticke; or in the stead thereof oyle of Cammomill, Wormewood, Mints, Quinces, and Roses, of each one ounce and a halfe, Mace, Masticke, Nutmegs, Cloues, Cardamome, Graines, Galingall, and Lignum Aloes, of each one quarter of an ounce, red Corall, prepared Coriander, Roses, Mints, Wormewood and Cammomill, of each two drag. and a halfe, crums of new Rie bread which haue been stéeped 24. howers in sharp Vineger, fower ounces; take them out and beate them to pap: afterwards melt thrée ounces and a halfe of Waxe in oyle, and then temper it vnto a salue.

Item, take oyle of Mastick, Spike, oyle of Quinces, of each thrée ounces, oile of Worme∣wood one ounce and a halfe, Masticke, Cloues, Nutmegs, wilde Vine leaues, Mints and Mirtle seeds, of each one quarter of an ounce, Wormewood, Roses, red and white Corall, of each one drag. with a little Waxe, and make an vnguent thereof. Another. If one can get none other thing, then take gréene or drie Wormewood, séeth it in Sallad oyle with a little Wine, vntill the wine be consumed, and annoynt therewith the stomacke. Oyle of Masticke is thus prepared: Take oyle of Roses sixe ounces,Oyle of Ma∣sticke. good wine fower oun∣ces, of grosse heaten Masticke one ounce and a halfe: let this séeth togither vntill the wine be decocted: This oyle doth not onely strengthen the stomacke, but also the braines, the sinewes, ioynts, and the Liuer, asswageth all paine and all swellings in all the parts of the body. To make oyle of Quinces. THis oyle of Quinces is also (next to the oyle of Masticke) very highly commended; for it is costly and good for all debilities of the stomacke, it alayeth all wambling, it streng∣theneth the digestiue vertue, and also the sinewes &c. and it is thus prepared: Take Quinces that be yet scant ripe, cut them with the pils in péeces, and take out the seeds; then take the iuice of Quinces, of the one as much as the other in a glasse, and powre into it as much oyle as there is of the iuice, but rather vnripe oyle then other: this being bounden tight, then set the glasse the space of fiftéene dayes in the Sun, afterwards let it boyle two or thrée howers in water, and then wring it hard through a cloth: this must be done thrée or fower times one after another, and so kept close stopped. For a conclusion of this weakenes of the stomacke through cold, some do vse this briefe meane, First, they do ordaine a Clister made in this manner following: take Lineseed and fresh butter, of each sixe ounces, of well washed Turpentine dissolued in wine or any decoction (wherein be much Annis seed sodden) one ounce; let the patient also drinke much of some de∣coction of Cloues, Galingall, Cinnamome, Balsam fruits, and Calmus: Lay then lastly this plaister following vpon the stomacke. Take Rue one ounce, Wormewood fower ounces: this being beaten togither, temper it with hony, and then lay it warme vpon the stomacke.
Of the debilitie of the stomack through heate. §. 6. IF so be that this weakenes of the stomack, and bad digestion of the same be with great thirst, without appetite, with sowre foule belchings, and with great drouth of the mouth, it is then very easily to be adiudged that the same is cau∣sed through heate. If there be Cholera mingled amongst it, then followeth wambling and parbraking, and that after the taking of light meates, as egs, fowles, and other good flesh. The mouth is bitter, and sometimes there com∣meth a shooting paine: he desireth all cold things, and all which is hote goeth against him. The digestion of the stomack is strong, if the heate indure not too long, which otherwise spoileth the same. These are the signes of the Gall or Bilis which troubleth or inflameth the stomack, and (as is said) molesteth the same with vomiting and a sharpe scowring. Now for to remedie this paine of the stomack, it is to be marked whether the sick person were not wont to cast, and if he were, he is then to vse this sirupe, which is necessarie for it: Take the iuice of sowre Quinces eight ounces, white Sugar fowre ounces, Vineger two ounces, seeth them to a sirupe; this sirupe doth not only coole vnnaturall heate of the stomack, but also strengtheneth it for to effect her worke, and expelleth the windines of the same. For this, is also very commodious the sirupe of Veriuice, or De Agresta, which doth also the same. Item, the sirupe of Peares, Peaches, and especially of Apples, which is described in the second part, the sixt Chapter, and 4. §. which be also these following that be made of the iuice of Bayberies, Sorrell, Roses, water Lillies, Limons, Citrons, Mirtle séeds, and of the iuice of Pomgranats. Item, Oxysacchara, Iulep of Roses and Violets, sirupe of Orenges are also highly commended for this, which be euery where described. Item, sirupe of Roses laxatiue, Oxymel sirupe of Endiue and of Vineger, or these following: Take Endiue, small Endiue, and Lettice, of each one handfull, the séeds of Melons, Cucum∣bers, Gourds, and Pompeons, of each one quarter of an ounce, Wormewood one handfull, Ro∣ses, Violets, of each one ounce, péeled Barly one handfull, the iuice of Pomegranats fowre ounces, Vineger thrée ounces, Sugar as much as you thinke good, make a sirupe thereof. Item, Hony of Roses expelleth all cholerick matter from the stomack, and doth strengthen the same: and if it be néedfull to vse any purgation for this, then shall you finde good instructions for it where we shall treate of Cholera, but chiefly is Cassie commended for it, because her cooling operation is very fit and méete for the stomack, for it clenseth the same from all moysture, and therefore are the confections of Cassy and Manna which be described hereafter in the binding of the bodie, esteemed very méete. Item, the Tabulates Diaturbith cum Rhabarbaro, and a certaine powder more, which is ex∣pressed in the same place. Amongst the Simples are Sene leaues the very principall, which haue a great propertie to purge the hote Cholera; the like doth also Aloe, Coloquint, the iuice of wilde Cucumbers, Epithymus, and twenty or thirty séeds of Palma Christi, which be very good, but that they be somewhat preiudiciall to the stomacke. Esula is somewhat too strong, for if the same be not well prepared, then is it venime in the body. Lawrell and the floures of Mezereon be excéeding sharp and perilous to be vsed. The Po∣lypodie roote is very safe, but yet somewhat hurtfull to the stomack. The yellow Mirobalans aboue all other do purge Cholera, and loose very necessarily. There be of such laxatiue simples many mo, but we haue only recited héere these simples for example, whereby to choose that which liketh him best, and to forbeare that which is to be eschued. When he hath purged, then is it counselled by diuers that this Potion following be taken after it. Take Fumitorie, Violets, Wormewood, of each one ounce; let these séeth so long in water, vntill about foure ounces do remaine of it. You are then to stéepe in this decoction one quarter of an ounce of yellow Miroba∣lans the space of a whole night, and being wrung out, then are you to temper amongst it one drag. or one quarter of an ounce of Hiera Picra, and in the morning early to drinke it warme. The order of Dyet. THe patient is to be sustained with such meates as be somewhat sowre, and that haue also an astringent vertue, as flesh boyled with vnripe Pomegranats, or for sauce for his meate
Veriuice, wine of Pomgranats, iuice of Oranges, Limons, and Prunes of Damaske, Lettice, Purslaine, both of them made sowre with Vineger, and so vsed. Barly pap, Quinces, rosted Peares, or stued Peares strewed with Fennell or Annis séed, eaten after meales, do shut vp the stomacke: The like do also wild dry Peares. Before in the first part the twelfth Chapter, and first §. you haue an especiall good stomachi∣call powder which is very good for all paines of the stomacke which proceede of Cholera. Item, take Roses ten drag. burnt Iuory three drag. prepared Coriander séeds fiue drag. giue him halfe an ounce thereof with sirupe of Pomegranats, or sirupe of Quinces. For this, are also good these confections following, as Triasantalon, Diarrhodon Abbatis, Rosata nouella, and Aroma∣ticum rosatum which is wholy of a temperate nature. Confected things which do coole the stomacke. THe Conserue of Raspes and of Lettice are both of them good for to coole the stomack: they make also a desire for meate, and do quicken the appetite. Muske peares do stay the va∣poring or fuming vp into the head. All preserued Cherries, Barberies, Cicorie roots, vn∣ripe Grapes, for what they be good, and how they are to be confected, shall sufficiently be taught in the last part. Item, take new conserue of Roses fowre ounces, sirupe of Apples as much as you please; temper them all together, and take halfe an ounce fasting in the morning. Or take Mastick one drag. Roses, burnt Iuorie & Mints, of each halfe a drag. prepared Coriander one quarter of an ounce, red Corrall one drag. and a halfe, Marmalad sixe ounces; make these with the sirupe of Apples a little soft, and stamp them all together in a mortar, and mixe them all well together. Marmalades without spice (whereof be diuers described in the last part) be also good remedies for the stomack, they stay the Flix, strengthen all the inward parts, & make ap∣petite. The conserue of Peach blossomes is also good. Conserues of Roses delay the sharpnes of the cholerick matter which causeth vomit. Conserues of Cicorie are also made for this. Of the Trocisks these are speciall good, De Spodio, Diarrhodon, De Camphora, De Barberis. And as touching his drinke, he must eschue all strong Wine, and drinke a small thin Wine. Chery wine cooleth and moystneth the stomacke and all inward parts through his tempe∣rate nature. Iulep of Violets, and all other cooling potions may be vsed. Hereafter in the treatise of Melancholy, there shall be described a very pretious wine, beginning thus: Take pickt Currans, &c. which may be also very commodiously vsed for this. Now for to come to the things which one may vse outwardly, we will speake first of the plaisters, and describe some of them. Take the iuice of Plantaine and Rose water, of each sixe ounces, Vineger one ounce, red and white Saunders, red Corrall, and prepared Coriander, of each one quarter of an ounce, Quince kernels, Sorrell séed, of each one drag. this being beaten small together, make a plai∣ster thereof with Barly meale, yet let it not be too hard, and lay it on the neck of the stomack. Another. Take red and white Saunders, Sorrell seed, Bay berries, Quince kernels, and the iuice of Quinces, of each one quarter of an ounce, oyle of Mastick one ounce; poune all that is to be pouned, séeth it by a mild fire or on hot ashes vntill the iuice be wasted, then straine it through a cloth, and make thereof a soft plaister with Waxe as much as is needfull for it. This plaister following is cooling and astringent. Take Roses, burnt Iuory, Masticke, Coriander, Mirtle kernels, and the iuice of Sloes, Sandaraca, & Dragon blood, of each half a drag. Laudanum one quarter of an ounce, Galliae Muscatae halfe a drag. Pitch and Rosin, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Waxe as much as is néedfull for a plaister; let all these be molten togither in fower ounces of the iuice of Quinces, and séeth it slowly vntill all the iuice be consumed, and it will be like to a soft plaister: it strengtheneth the weake stomacke of heate, of Cholera, and of an Ague; it quencheth thirst, stayeth excessiue vomiting, scowring, and also the paine of the stomacke. Out of all the foresaid things may you make salues with oyle of Roses, Violets, Quinces, and Masticke (which you please) vntill that the salue be soft enough. In like maner is the salue of Roses also especially good for the heate of the stomacke. The stomack is also to be annointed with this oyle following; as oyle of Quinces, oyle of Masticke, and chiefly when there be Vine tendrels decocted therein.
Of Bags, Applications, and Fomentations for the stomacke. TAke red and white Saunders, red and white Corrall, and Citron séed, of each one drag. prepared Coriander one drag. and a halfe: these being all stamped together grossely, make a bag thereof. Take Rose water, Endiue water, and water of Mints, of each twelue ounces, the iuice of sowre Quinces two ounces, of red and white Saunders, prepared Coriander, red Corrall, and Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, Wormewood halfe a handfull, wherewith you may foment, and put the decocted herbs in a bag, and so apply them to the stomacke. Of the debilitie of the stomacke through drought. §. 7. WHeresoeuer is any weakenes of the stomacke caused through drought (whereof hath béen spoken at the first) it causeth great thirst, drought of the tongue, and fal∣ling away of the whole bodie, as also contrarywise they finde ease when they finde moyst things. In this disease is the patient to drinke Milke, and Barly water; for the same do coole, moysten, and cause the body to increase againe. In like manner he is also to be fed with moystning herbs, as Lettice, Mallowes, and such like: also with Veale, Lamb, Riuer fish. Egs drest with Wine are also good for him, for that they yeeld good nourishment. Item, there be very good and commodious Pullet broths drest with cooling herbs, Capon waters, Marchpanes, and other things moe, which before in the Con∣sumption or Phthisi in the second part the fifth Chapter and 22. §. and afterwards in the sixt part of the Ague Hectica, are expressed, all which be prepared for to moysten. He shall also often∣times bathe before meales and after meales, but a good while after. His drinke must be small Wine. Rest is good for him, and much motion is hurtfull, he is further to rule himselfe in all things as for the Consumption, and as is taught for the Ague Hectica. But in case there strike great heate into it, then vse the salue of Roses and Saunders, the cooling salue Galeni, oyle of Roses, of Violets and waterlilies and such like. But this plaister following is highly com∣mended: Take new sliced Gourds, Purslaine and Willow leaues, of each two ounces, white Saunders one quarter of an ounce, Camfer one drag. Rose water as much as is néedfull: temper them and lay them vpon the stomack: you may lay also a bladder of cold water vpon the stomacke. But this is héere to be noted, that the cooling things must be laid vpon it in such manner, that the places adiacent about it, to wit, the Midriffe, the Liuer, and the Milt, may not thereby be harmed, and lose their naturall action: for which, it is also aduised that when the same is perceiued, that the same place be annoynted with warme oyle. Of the skalding in the throate, and of the hartburning. §. 8. ALthough this hartburning be caused diuersly, yet neuerthelesse doth the same come alwayes for the most part through heate, or through ascending vapors, through strong Wine dronken, Spices, fat meates, and such like, against which these things insuing are to be vsed, to wit, conserue of Betonie, Gillo∣floures, and the wine of both these: also the first stomachicall medicine described aboue in the 5. §. Item, Marmalade, and preserued sowre Peares. Some do hang about their neck for this disease the herbe Agrimony. Other do hold in their mouth the stone in the Carps head. Other do eate fiue or sixe Peach kernels, or bitter Almonds vpon it, &c. of which euery one may choose that which liketh him best. Of Inappetencie or lost appetite, and whereby it may be remedied. §. 9. OF all the foresaid debilities of the stomacke, like as also in all diseases incident vnto it, the Appetite commonly is taken away, except the infirmitie of the vnnaturall hunger. Yea there is sometimes such loathing of meates therewith, that they cannot
abide to smell them. The causes thereof are diuers: the first is heate, wherein the patient hath very small desire to eate but great list to drinke, with drouth of the toong, and loathing of all warme things. If it be mingled with Cholera, then is there alwaies bitternes with it, with a wambling. Or if so be that there be any Phlegma with it, then doth the patient alwayes finde some kinde of brackishnes in the mouth. Secondly, this may also be caused through cold, whereby the constringent vertue and taste of the stomacke are destroied. These are the signes: small thirst, much spettle and other filth about the mouth of the stomacke; the patient doth féele heauines or pinching. Other whiles he parbraketh some Phlegma, be it sweete or sower he shall feele it in the mouth. All warme things are welcome vnto him; cold things go against his stomacke. This disease may also be well caused by eating too much cold fruit, or by drinking of water. Thirdly, the hot Agues do also take away the appetite. Fourthly, impostumes of the sto∣macke, of the liuer, and of the milt, which be not without an Ague. These may be perceiued by swelling and paine of the same parts, whose remedies are taught in the description of the selfe∣same members. Fiftly, this is also caused through a tough slimie matter which lieth in the mouth of the stomacke, and there doth take away the appetite. The signes of them are these: if one do cast vp againe all that he hath taken, be it sower, swéete, hot, cold, like as Oliues, & such like. And albeit they do remaine in the stomacke, yet do they make great paine and dissension. Sixtly, there appeereth a certaine debilitie of the retentiue power in ye flesh, in the small veines, in the muscles, and other members, whereby (as behooueth) they cannot draw their nourish∣ment vnto them, so that the stomacke may also thereby beare the lesse meate. The signes whereof are these: the patient is méetely desirous of meate, but when the same is set before him then can he eate but very little of it. Seuenthly, it is sometimes caused, for that melancho∣lie very slowly or nothing at all hath his course towards the mouth of the stomack, which was woont there to excitate appetite to meate; which may well be perceiued hereby, if he be giuen to eate sower meates: by which meanes the appetite partly returneth againe. The cause may also be wormes, whereof shall be spoken hereafter. Ninthly, it may well happen for that the Melancholie too abundantly runneth towards the mouth of the stomacke, whereof the signes be vomiting of melancholike humors, sowernes of the mouth, black colour of the face, debilitie of the stomacke and hart. The tenth cause is, when women begin to beare, whereof the signes be sufficiently knowen. Eleuenthly, the ouerhot time and aire may likewise cause the same, like as doth also excéeding cold and much watching; which causes and signes may be learned of the patient, and demanded of them that do tend him. Twelfely, through great vexations of the mind, as anger, sorrow, care, anguish, great ioy, desire of Venerie which cannot be obtained, as well as that which may be obtained. Thirteenthly, this lost appetite may be caused through any corruption in the stomack, which may be perceiued through stench of the breth, or through the ordure. This is also otherwhiles caused by reason of the scowring called Diarrhaea with in∣tolerable stench. There be also many mo causes: but the abouesaid shall be sufficient vnto vs for this time. Now we will proceede to prepare remedies for those lost appetites, whereby o∣therwise people might perish at length. First, if so be that this lost appetite procéedeth through heate and Cholera, then is the patient to be brought to vomiting, for that by reason that the matter is light and liquid, therefore may it easily be expelled, and for to prepare for the same, let the patient take Oxysacchara and sirupe of vineger which shall immediately hereafter be described, and thereupon vse this milde and gentle purgation. Take Fumitory and Wormewood, of each two ounces, put them in water vntill that there remaine about fower ounces, then stéepe therein one ounce of grosse beaten Mirobalans one whole night, afterwards wring them well out, and so giue it him. Also one may purge with the confection of Triphera & Rubarb. This sirupe following is very much welcome vnto the stomacke: Take the iuice of Apples that be somewhat sower, and the iuice of Quinces, of each eight ounces both well clarified, then séethe them togither with eight ounces of Sugar vnto a sirupe, whereof euery morning & euening giue him two ounces at one time. Also Marmalade may be vsed alone. But if you will haue it stronger, then take eight ounces of the foresaid confection, and temper it with a little wine; and when the same is a little cold againe, then mixe amongst it one ounce of beaten Roses, Species Triasandali, halfe an ounce,
Spica, and Lignum Aloes, of each one quarter of an ounce. For this be also good, Seruices, Peares, sirupe of Mulberies, sirupe of Vineger, Oxysacchara, Oxymel, confected Coriander, Me∣lon seede, and all that is sower. On the outside shall you apply as followeth: Take a Quince peare, cut it very small and take out the coare, and let the same boyle in oyle of Roses; afterwards beate it very small, and temper therewith the séeds of Butchers broome, Barberies, Roses and red Saunders, of each one quarter of an ounce, the pils of Grapes thrée dragmes beaten small, then spread it on a lea∣ther, and weare it on your stomacke. Vineger eaten with Lettice is also very good: so are also Quinces, a little Sorrell, Veriuice, Limons, the iuice of Citrons, Orenges, sower Apples, Pomegranates, and Mulberies that are, and all, yet scant ripe. Also all they that haue lost their appetite of eating, must beware of all fat flesh and meate, that is drest with much oyle and butter. You shall haue also a further resolution or aduise in the sixt part, where we speake and dis∣course of Agues, what is néedfull to be done for the defect of appetite. But if so be that this lost appetite do procéede of cold, then are these preparatiues to be vsed. The sirupe of Citron pils, Wormewood and Mints, of each halfe an ounce, tempered in Barley water, and so dronken fower or sixe mornings one after another. For to purge, vse Pillulae stomachicae, Hiera Picra sharpned with a little of the Trocisci Al∣handali: this is passing good if one haue a fowle matter stinking in the stomacke. Afterwards he may take any of these confections ensuing, Diacyminum, Aromaticum Rosatum, Diatrion pipere∣on, Diacalamintha, and sometimes some Treacle: also Marmalade with spices, greene Ginger, and Chebuli: The stomachicall powder which is described in the first part, the twelfth chapter, and first §. Salsamentum Regium.In like maner also the Salsamentum Regium, which is thus made: Take Fennell & Parsley séed, Cinnamom, Cloues, of each a like quantity; let them séeth well in Vineger, then put vnto the broth a good deale of Sugar, and so vse it for all other meate in stead of a sauce: This hath an especiall operation to quicken the appetite. For this may also be vsed Onions, Garlicke, spices, confected Cinnamom, and Annis séeds, rosted and stued Peares stucke full of Cloues. And this salue for the stomack may also be made thus: Take Sallad oyle sixe ounces, Mints, Wormewood, Marierom gentle, & marsh Mints, of each one ounce, Nutmegs, Cipers nuts, of each one quarter of an ounce, Annis, Fennell, Cloues, of each halfe a drag. white wine sixe ounces; cut and beate all grosse togither, and so let it seeth vntill the wine be decocted away: afterwards wring it out hard through a cloth, and annoint the place therewith warme. Afterwards strew this powder following vpon it: Take Frankinsence and Masticke, of each halfe an ounce, Cipers rootes one quarter of an ounce, Mints, Wormewood, & Nutmegs, of each one dragme, and then apply vnwasht shéepes wooll vpon it méetely warme. Forasmuch as not onely here, but in other places moe, the sirupe of Vineger is specified: therefore we will here describe it after two sorts, like as the same is vsed at the Apothecaries: the first is called Syrupus Acetosus simplex,Syrupus Ace∣tosus simplex. and is thus prepared: Take good sharp Vineger thrée ounces, Sugar fiue ounces; clarifie it with the white of an egge, and let the Vineger be decocted to a sirupe. This sirupe is very good against all corrupted humors: for it doth attenuate all thicke slime, and causeth all tough matter to auoid, softeneth the hard, and expelleth all bad hu∣mors: it openeth all obstructions, and prouoketh vrine: in fine, it is good for all bad corrupti∣ons of the body, and is also very good for all pestilent Feuers, for it quencheth the thirst. Compositus vel cum Ra∣dicibus.The other sirupe of Vineger do the Phisitions call Syrupum Acetosum compositum, or Aceto∣sum cum Radicibus, and is made thus: Take faire Well water about one quarte, the rootes of Fennell, Smallage and Endiue well clensed, of each one ounce and a halfe, Annis, Fennell, and Smallage séeds, of each halfe an ounce, beaten grossely; let them séeth vnto the halfe, then wring out hard all the liquor, and put thereto eightéene ounces of white Sugar, twelue ounces of strong Vineger; séeth them to a sirupe. This sirupe doth cause grosse humors to auoide, and chiefly the cholericke slime which will hardly be expelled from the Lights: It openeth also all the oppilations of the Liuer, Lights, and Kidneies.
Of the wambling, and the loathing of meate. §. 10. ALl they that haue lost their desire and appetite to meate, haue commonly such a loathing of all meate, that they can neither abide to see nor to smel it. This debi∣litie of the stomacke do the learned call Subuersionem, Fastidium, Nauseam, and the Grecians Anorexian, which is, when all things do go against the stomack, and hath no delight in any, after which followeth wambling, and then Atro∣phia, when the patient cannot sustaine himselfe any longer. Also when one ca∣reth for no meate, and when the stomacke is molested with continuall wambling and parbra∣king, and yet notwithstanding cannot cast vp, the body falleth away, and doth vtterly come to the Consumption Tabes: for this Atrophia is a spice of a Consumption. So that these things, as inappetencie, or losse of appetite, wambling and lothsomnesse, do commonly depend on each o∣ther, and are almost caused of one manner of cause, therfore haue we described them beside each other. The causes which prouoke this losse of appetite and wambling, may well be these here∣after following, to wit, when one beholdeth some lothsome thing or any other filth, as when an other vomiteth, whereby the imagination is moued, and the stomacke also vrged to vomit, and yet neuerthelesse cannot by any meanes parbrake at all; as it commeth often to passe, when as any be stricken hard vpon the stomacke. Also the same may be caused through ouergreat heate or cold: Also if one haue ouercharged himselfe with meate or drinke, and chiefly with Porke, with Celes, with water Fowles, and with excessiue Wine, or such like, and then thereupon followeth no exercise, whereby such cruditie might be digested. These diseases may also be caused through some bad and slimie humours which are in the stomacke, whether it be through mixture of heate, Cholera, or cold Phlegma, or otherwise; the which notwithstanding, how late soeuer that it be, do trouble the stomacke, cause wambling, but not so forcibly that the stomacke is able thereby to expell them. The signes thereof are for the most part apparant to the eye, and to be enquired of the sicke person. If it be long of the stomacke, then is some heate to be perceiued in the féeling of the sto∣macke, which also is by the complexion augmented, as old age, the time of the yeare. And if o∣therwhiles there be somewhat parbraked or vomited vp, and that the same commeth through cold, then causeth it neither thirst nor heate, the patient desireth rest and quiet. If so be that it do come through heate and cold, then do come all things for the most part by the foresayd fée∣blenesse of the stomacke, for which are the remedies here expressed to be vsed: yet is this here especially commended But if so be that this wambling or lothsomnesse do procéede of Cholera, with heate and bit∣ternesse of the mouth, drought of the throate and tongue, then prepare the matter with sirupe of Vineger, and with Oxymel simplex. The vomiting and purging must be brought to passe through these meanes following: Take Violets, Burrage flowers, and Buglosse flowers, of each halfe an ounce, 15. or 16. Damaske Prunes, séeth them togither with 18. ounces of water vnto the halfe, then lay to stéepe therein a whole night, half an ounce of yellow Mirobalans, Rubarb one dragme or more, afterwards wring it out very hard, and drinke it betimes in the morning. After purging strengthen the stomacke with sirupe of Apples, of Pomegranats, or of Quinces which is made of Sugar. And for this is to be vsed also the confection Triasantalon, conserue of Roses, or Rosata Nouella. First, he must eate Lettice, Purslaine, and Sorrell, with Vineger, and Strawberies if they be ripe. His meate must be tempered with the iuice of Sor∣rell, Oranges, and the iuice of Limons. But if this wambling or lothsomnesse do procéede of cold, then must the matter be prepared with Oxymel diureticum, or with sirupe of Wormwood, and with wine of Wormwood, and af∣terwards must the patient be constrained to vomit. For to purge must be taken Diaturbith or Hiera Picra, which is sharpened with a little Esula & Masticke: after purging, Marmalad with spices is to be vsed, and Aromaticum rosatum, Dia∣pliris with Muscus, or Letitiae Galeni. Also make a sauce of Parsley, Sage, Mints, Cloues, beatē togither, and tempered with vineger. Moreouer, all manner of other meanes are to be vsed to quicken the appetite. Outwardly is the stomacke to be annointed with the oyle of Mastick and of Wormwood.
Plaisters and other things mo which be fit for this, are to be found in the treatise of the debi∣litie of the stomacke. But if this disease be caused through repletion of the body, then is the cure to be begun with letting bloud, & afterwards to purge (whether it came through heate or cold) and so to procéede with other things. Of wambling or vomiting through weaknesse of the Stomacke. §. 11. AS we haue spoken of the lothsomnesse of meate: so we will now make mention of the third, which is of the vomiting. This is partly a desire, and partly a constraint of vomiting. But to speake aduisedly of it, there be two kindes of vomitings: to wit, that which is called of the Grecians Anastrophe, and of the Latinists Inuersio (which is a turning vpside downe of the stomacke) wherein all that is beneath in the stomacke is yéelded vpward by vomit; the other man∣ner of vomiting is called Cholera, or Cholerica passio: the which not onely with parbraking, but also with a strong scowring doth take one, whereof we will now write. Concerning the first kinde of vomiting, it is thus described: Vomiting is a motion of the stomacke, whereby it doth cast vpwards that which is grosse, and all that is hurtfull vnto it. The causes of this ca∣sting are many: namely, to strike on the stomacke, to fall, and such like, or vpon any other parts, which haue some sympathie with the stomacke, as the braines, and other strong mo∣tions. Item, when it happeneth to those that are vpon the boysterous sea: or if there fall in∣to the stomacke any corrupted humors, and there destroy the digestion of the stomacke. Also this parbraking may be caused through some kinde of meate, which prouoketh vomite, as we haue shewed heretofore. Item, all things whereof nature hath a loathing, as Frogs & Snailes, &c. Also the Cough may otherwhiles be too strong, and so prouoke one to vomit. Likewise also impostumes, tumors of the stomacke, or the Lights: for nature cannot suffer nor abide any mat∣ter. Lastly, all such vomits do come also through debilitie of the vertue retentiue, and violence of the vertue expulsiue, or if any one haue taken néesing rootes, or any such like. The signes of the parbraking are these: when one beginneth to féele a wambling, and when the lower lip begins to quiuer, the vppermost intrailes begin to stirre, and feele the paine of the head, and hart, giddines, and when the mouth is full of slime: the which be for the most part all the signes, that the stomacke is charged with Cholera. But if the causes of parbraking procéede of outward things, then are they to be demanded of the sicke person, and of them that be with him. Or if any do come of any stinking matter which is in the stomacke, that is to be perceiued by the stinch of the vrine, or by that which is cast vp, or by the stench of the ordure, wherewith the matter is otherwhiles admixed, and the patient shall well féele the same in his mouth, like as we haue sufficiently spoken thereof already. But before we come to the remedies of these diseases, it is first néedfull to adde some com∣mon rules for this parbraking. Whereof the first is, that whensoeuer the parbraking doth chaunce naturally, and the pati∣ent findeth ease by it, that it is not then to prohibited, in case that the naturall strength be not thereby enféebled, which is then to be holpen by all meanes possible. The second rule is, when nature beginneth to expell by vomit all that is hurtfull for her, that then it is yet more to be procured. Thirdly, persons that be narrow in the breast, and haue a long leane necke, weake sight, and feeble braines, they are by no meanes to be brought to this vomiting. Fourthly, if one would haue any body parbrake which is very hard to be brought vnto it, then is he first to eate much meate & other things, which causeth the humors to be loose, and also to drinke much, whereby the vertue retentiue is weakened, and the expulsiue strength∣ned, whereby the vomiting may be the more easily effected, but this is of no value for the Ague. Fiftly, rough and grosse things taken are not to be expelled through parbraking, that the throate (through which the same is to passe) be not thereby brused. Sixtly, the vomiting is very dangerous for the stomacke. Seuenthly, in them that haue an impostume in the stomacke, it is very dangerous to prouoke vomiting. Eightly, odoriferous things be very acceptable vnto the stomack, and assisting, especially when they be admixed with alimentall meates, therefore be they commonly ioyned with those things which prouoke vomit. Ninthly, to withdraw the
matter and humors of these excessiue vomitings, are the outward members to be bounden, to wit, the armes and legs, and also to set the féete in warme water. Tenthly, when it is seen that this vomit hapneth in a violent disease, after the manner of a Crisis or ending of the disease, then is the same not to be stayed at any hand, if it so be that it come not too vehemently, whereby nature might be weakened, but then is the same to be cured with his contraries. Ele∣uenthly, for this vnmeasurable and excessiue vomiting, may the matter be conueniently drawne downwards by Clisters. These now be rules which are to be obserued in all manner of vomiting. When as the vo∣miting procéedeth of hote causes, which is presaged by the bitternesse of the mouth, desire and longing for cold things, then is the matter to be prepared with Oxysacchara, or such like sirupes, and to prouoke vomiting by drinking warme water, and oyle of Violets, and by putting a fea∣ther into the throate. But if the same will not be, then are you to purge, especially with yel∣low Mirobalans, and afterwards to strengthen the stomacke, whereof we haue giuen good ad∣uice before. If the patient be of a plethoricke constitution, then must there be no neglect of opening the Basilica, for thereby shall the matter be diminished, and the whole body cooled. But the principallest things that be requisite for this, are Roses, Saunders, prepared Cori∣ander, Violets, sowre Apples and Peares, Peaches, Quinces, Camfer, blossomes and pils of Pomegranats, Corall, Bolus, Dragon bloud, the rindes of a Medlar trée, Quince trée, Oke, & Plum trée; Vineger, the iuice of Sorrell, sodden iuice of Quinces, the iuice of Medlars and of Seruices, sirupes of Roses, Violets, Raspes, Citrons, Limons, Oranges, and such like. Of the foresayd things you may if you please make Confections, Conserues, Sirupes, Potions, or any thing else what you please. It is especially obserued, that Purslaine eaten with Vineger, taketh away the parbraking through heate. But there is to be layd vpon the outside of the mouth and the stomacke and pit of the hart, this plaister following: Take the pils and blos∣soms of Pomegranats, the seeds of Butchers broome, and of Mirtles, of Roses and Bayberies, of each half an ounce, Mastick, Mints, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Lignum Aloes one drag. the iuice of Quinces and of wild Peares, of each alike quantitie, or so much as is néedfull for to make a plaister with it. And to the end this may be the more piercing, mixe therwith one ounce and a halfe of Vineger, and then spread it on a cloth, and lay it thereon, as is sayd. But if the iuice of Quinces & wild Peares be not to be gotten, then take the iuice of Plantaine in stead thereof: Or heate Vineger, and wet therein a péece of felt or a sponge, and so lay it ouer the sto∣macke either hote or cold, and then lay on the top thereof a Rosecake, which is made wet ouer the vapor of Vineger: but annoynt the stomack before with the iuice of Mints, and then strew the powder of Roses and Mirtle séede vpon it. Here before in the twelfth rule is spoken of a Clister, whereof you haue one here for exam∣ple: Take Mallowes, Hollihock rootes, Violet leaues, and Beetes, of each one handfull, péeled Barley and Bran, of each halfe a handfull, eightéene or twentie Prunes, let them séeth, then take 16. ounces of this decoction, and put therein an ounce of Cassie, and of Succo Rosarum half an ounce: temper all togither, and vse thereof two or thrée one after another, vntill that the bo∣dy be well opened. But if the parbraking be caused through cold & Plehgma, and the patient do not vomit much nor often, and that nature be not much diseased, then must be giuen to the patient Oxymel of Squils, Syrupus de Calamintha, or warme water, wherein Dill, field Mints, and Sage are deco∣cted. And afterwards he is to purge with Hiera Picra, which is sharpned with a little of the Trocisci Alhandali, or with pils of Aloe lota or Stomachicis tempered togither, or each apart. Vomiting must be furthered or procured, and although that to this end there be many medi∣cines described, notwithstanding is this hereafter following not to be omitted: Take the iuice of Squils, the iuice of Onions, of each one ounce and a halfe, Sugar thrée ounces: seeth these so thick that it will make Tabulats, or Sugar plates, each of the waight of thrée dragmes. When you will vse them, then dissolue them, and drinke them, and then looke if you can vomit after∣wards, the Squils haue an especiall power to moue vomite. When as then the matter is throughly purged, then to comfort the stomacke with sirupe of Quinces, with Miua, and with sirupe of Mints and Wormewood. His meate must be drest with good Spices, his drinke shall be good old and pleasant Wine. He must annoynt the sto∣macke
with the oyle of Mastick, and with the oyle of Spike tempered togither, or each alone, then strew thereon powder of Mastick, and lay a cleane cloth vpon it. This plaister ensuing may also be made and prepared for the same: Tost white bread so hard that you may powne it, and temper it with Vineger, and the iuice of Mints, put there∣to one ounce of Mastick, more or lesse according to the quantitie of the white bread, make them warme, & then temper therewith a little oyle of Spike and Mastick, and so lay it warme on the pit of the stomacke. Or take tosted bread as before, and temper it with the iuice of Mints, and strew halfe an ounce of this powder following vpon it: Take Mints, Ginger, Wormwood, Cypers nuts, Cinnamome and Spike, of each one dragme, Frankinsence, Ma∣stick, of each half an ounce, and make a powder thereof, it warmeth, strengtheneth, and astrin∣geth. There may also be made of this foresayd powder Confections, Plaisters, Oyles, and all whatsoeuer one will. It hapneth also sometimes that with this vomiting a laske or flixe is adioyned. For to stay the same are these things following good, parched Cresses séede, Cypers Nut leaues, Mirrhe, Lignum Aloes, red Styrax, Amber, Laudanum, Indis Spica, Spica Romana, Calmus, Cloues, Mints, Wormwood, Citrons, Limons, Oranges, Frankinsence, Mastick, Rue, Agnus castus, tosted bread, Gallia Muscata, and Alipta, & almost all kinds of Spices. Also Treacle taken with the iuice of Mints, stayeth vomiting. Item, make a plaister of Mastick, with a little sodden Turpentine, and lay it on the sto∣mack: for this also are you to set boxing cups vpon the shoulders. For this also is Marmalade with Spices very good, and preserued Quinces, and these are the common meanes against the vomiting through a weake stomacke, be it through heate or cold. You shall also finde many mo described in other places of this booke, amongst diuers sick∣nesses, as before in the second part, the fift Chapter and 2. §. is discouered for the spetting of bloud, and such like. We will now passe ouer to another manner of parbraking through Cholera. Of Parbraking or Vomiting, with the laske or scouring. §. 12. THis maladie do the learned name after the humour whereby it is caused, Chole∣ram. The later Phisitions call it Cholericam Passionem, and it is thus described: Cholera is a very sharpe, troublesome, and heauie disease, which immediatly molesteth one with the Rheume, whereby vomiting, great flixe, or scouring, Collick, paine of the bowels, & an Ague is bred. Or, Cholera is a violent sicknes, with vomiting, great scowring or laske, with Cramp in the sinewes, Thighes and Legs, whereby all outward members are cold, and the pulse is small and slow. Or, Cholera is such a maladie, whereby one immediatly doth scowre and rid vpward and downeward many kinds of humors and slime, with the meate; so that he detaineth nothing in his body. This sicknesse commeth first of spoyled and corrupted meate, which remaineth to long in some place of the body, as in the stomack or bowels, and there causeth a bad alteration, and also giueth little nourishment. Also this sicknesse is sometimes caused of cold and waterish humors, which gather themselues togither in ye bowels, and in the stomack, that do debilitate the retentiue vertue of the stomack aboue and beneath. But the sicknesse for the most part is caused through much Cholera and red gall, that do so lye and bite in the stomack & bowels, that within the space of one houre the parbraking and going to the stoole do so haunt a body, that otherwhiles the strongest body on the third day is depriued of his life, and this is worse then all other. The signes of a cold cause are these, before the sicknesse be vpon one, much windinesse is felt in the bowels: also some dayes before the sicknesse, he féeleth paine and shooting about the Nauell, whereupon presently ensueth a vehement laske, or flixe, with vomiting of much slime and other illfauored matter. This is also the sooner caused, if the patient haue vsed great store of phlegmaticall meates. That which is caused through heate is hereby knowne: there falleth much Cholera into the stomack and bowels, with great and mightie parbraking, and also with great thirst, and if one drinke cold water, then doth the vomiting stay vntill that the water be warmed in ye stomack. The Fluxe is so vehement, that the patient sometimes thereby swouneth, and also vtterly
loseth the pulse, with an vnstedfast heate, and bereauing of his senses. When as then it hapneth that one feeleth a continual paine in the stomacke or bowels, with great heauinesse of mind, and perceiueth parbraking and vomiting: then is such verily to be ta∣ken for Cholera: for this, there is to be giuen to the sicke body lukewarme water to drinke very often. And if so be that this parbraking and scowring continue still, then giue him warme wa∣ter to drinke againe, as before, and that so long till you find that he haue auoyded some corrup∣ted meates, slime, or some of the gall. This will frée the patient of mo other sicknesses. For this are moe other things to be vsed; to wit, that expell this sharpe matter: so that Phlegma with things necessary for it, and Cholera with those that helpe it, might be taken in hand, because parbraking will be cured by parbraking, and scowring by scowring. When as then the scowring is stayed of both ends, then is the patiēt to bath one houre long: afterwards to eate a little, and that light meate, because the stomacke is very much weakened. After that, he is to eate a little Marmalade, which is tempered with prepared Coriander, and so go sleepe. He is to vse this Marmalade as long as the scowring or parbraking endureth. His diet must be Hen broth, decocted with Veriuice, steeled Goats milke, Barley and Oten paps, sodden Lettice and Purslaine; but principally if there be any heate and bitternesse of the mouth remaining: but if so be that there be any cold in the stomacke, then are these herbes at no hand to be vsed. When as the patient beginneth againe to féede well, then be good for him all field foules, and chiefly Partridges which haue a proper hidden vertue to strengthen the sto∣macke. Amongst other meates may well be vsed Limons, Citrons, Oranges, Veriuice & such like. Item, all sower fruits, Seruices, vnripe Medlars, sower Peares, Apples and Quinces. Also he shal eate (although not gladly) sops of white bread in the iuice of Pomegranats: and if so be that he vomit vp the same, yet must he take more againe, and do this so long till that he do hold and retaine it. As long as he is not through wholethen is he to drinke stéeled water with sirupe of Quinces, or old conserue of Roses. When he beginneth to be whole, then is he to drinke good relished wine, which is tempered with the iuice of Pomegranates. And if so be that he parbrake it vp, then let him drinke of ye same againe, but a little at once, that the stomacke be not ouercharged. Here followeth now what is to be vsed for this scowring and parbraking, and chiefly when it is seene that these diseases do increase. For which one is not to be discomforted, but much more bestir him to helpe the sicke person with these remedies following: First, you must giue him one or two dragmes of Trociscos de Olibano, with water or iuice of Pomegranates: and af∣terwards to bind his legs fast: like as is taught before against the parbraking, when the vomi∣ting getteth the vpper hand; so must his armes likewise be bounden, when the scowring get∣teth the mastery. But aboue all, sleepe is passing good. Item Rose water layd very cold ouer the legs, or from the vpper part of the legs downward wetted and washed therewith, and the féete set in it, is also very good. In like manner is this plaister ensuing forcible to asswage the paine, & to warme and streng∣then: Take rindes of the Medlar tree, of Quinces, and of an Oaken tree, the séede of Butchers broome, blossomes and rindes of Pomegranates, Mirtle séed, Sarcocolla, Masticke, Cammomill, and Melilot, of each a like quantitie: make a plaister thereof with the iuice of Quinces, or of wild and sower Peares, and spreade it on a cloth. But if the scowring be stronger then the par∣braking, then lay it warme vpon the belly. But if the parbraking be sorest of al, then lay it vp∣on the stomacke. Others do make two plaisters, as hereafter followeth. Take Laudanum, Masticke, of each one ounce and a halfe, Frankinsence halfe a dragme, red and white Saunders, red Corrall, séedes of Butchers broome, of each one scruple, yellow Rose séeds, the iuice of Sloes, Hypocistis, blossomes and pils of Pomegranates, of each halfe a scruple, beaten small togither as much as is néedfull for a plaister; spread thereof vpon a cloth, and lay a great plaister therof ouer the stomacke, before and behind vpon the backe about the Kidneies. Item, take the iuice Plantaine and Rose water, of each thrée ounces, Vineger halfe an ounce, Masticke, Frankinsence, of each halfe a dragme, Lentill meale as much as is néedfull for to make a plaister withall. Another called de Crustapanis: Take Masticke, Mints, burnt Iuorie, red Corall,De Crusta pa∣nis. red and white Saunders, of each one dragme, Crusts of white bread two ounces; stéepe them halfe an houre in Vineger, afterwards beate them all togither, and temper amongst it oyle of Masticke
and oyle of Quinces, of each one ounce, Barley meale as much as doth suffice for a plaister, and lay it warme vpon the stomacke. This taketh away the parbraking within the space of halfe an houre. Hereafter follow moe salues and oyles. TAke oile of Masticke and oyle of Roses, of each a like much, temper therewith a little Vi∣neger, and annoint the stomacke with it. Item, take oyle of Masticke, of Quinces, and of Mirtles, of each halfe an ounce, Roses, red Corall, and Mints, of each halfe a dragme, Nutmegs, Mirtle seed, of each two scruples, and a little Vineger; temper them all with Waxe, and make a salue of them or a plaister. You haue a salue also here before in the tenth Chapter, & the 5. §. beginning thus. Take Comin and Caruway, &c. which is especiall good against parbra∣king being rubbed warme vpon the stomacke and the Nauell. You may also rub alone vpon it the iuice of Plantaine tempered with Rose water: but to make it thicke, mingle therwith Len∣till meale. Take oyle Wormewood one ounce, oyle of Quinces, Mints, and Masticke, of each halfe an ounce, Malmesey fiue dragmes; let them boyle vntill the wine be wasted, and when it is almost cold, then temper therewith Species Diagalangae, Aromatici Rosati, de xylo aloes, of each one dragme, and Waxe as much as sufficeth for a plaister. Item, take red Saunders and Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, Gallia muscata, and Camfer, of each one dragme, Rose water sixe ounces; temper, and then lay it on the belly: for it asswageth and cooleth. Item, Rose water alone made cold in snow, and layd vpon the belly, and when it is warme, layd cold againe vp∣on it, is very commodious for this purpose. Another. Take Bayberries, Medlar leaues, Frankinsence, Tormentill, grosse Marierom, (or them that one can best get) of each halfe an ounce; cut and séeth it in red wine, and after∣wards lay it as a warme plaister vpon the stomacke with Tow wetted therein: This is espe∣cial good for al them that cannot kéepe in their meate. This ensuing is also accompted to haue a maruellous operation: Take the iuice of Crabs, make a double cloth wet therein; if his body be hot with an Ague, then lay it cold vpon it: but if the body be cold, then apply it lukewarme vpon it. Item, take tosted bread beaten small foure ounces, Masticke one quarter of an ounce; make it meetely hot, and lay it warme in a bag vpon the stomacke: It taketh wind away, and also the Collike in the belly. Another. Take Roses, blossomes of Pomegranates, of each one handfull and a halfe, Gallia muscatae one dragme an a halfe, the iuice of Sloes, Mirtles, Frankinsence, of each one dragme, Wormewood, Hypocistis, Cypers rootes, Cloues Masticke, of each halfe a dragme, red and white Corall, Spica, of each one scruple, tosted bread half an ounce, Camfere halfe a drag. beate it small togither, and then put it into a bag, and so apply it. In the mixture of other things is oftentimes mention made of the Trocisci of Gallia muscata, or Alipta muscata: And because that their description is but briefe, we will here adde it vnto the rest. Gallia musca∣ta.Gallia muscata is made thus: Take Lignum Aloes fiue dragmes, Amber thrée dragmes, Muske one dragme, Dragagant dissolued in Rose water, as much as sufficeth for to make Trociscos with it,Alipta musca∣ta. and kéepe them well. The Alipta muscata is thus prepared: Take pure Laudanum foure ounces, liquid Styrax one ounce and a halfe, red Styrax one ounce, Lignum Aloes halfe a drag. Amber one dragme, Camfere halfe a dragme, Muske halfe a scruple, and a little Rose water, and prepare them thus: In the Dog dayes must you set the Styrax and Laudanum with the Rose water togither in the Sun, let them there dry togither vntill they be hard as dow; af∣terwards stamp them in a mortar, and temper the rest amongst them, then forme Trocisces of them, and keepe them very well, like as you do the other. For this parbraking is also vsed fo∣menting vpon the stomacke: therefore make or chuse your selfe that which you desire of these things which be prescribed. Take the things which we haue ordained for the first bags beaten grosly, séeth them in the iuice of Quinces, and in Rose water, of each sixe ounces, red thicke Wine eight ounces, Vineger two ounces; make therin a cloth or sponge wet, wring it wel out, and hold it very warme vpon the stomacke. Another. When the stomacke is vtterly spoyled, so that the patient can neither abide meate nor drinke, then may it be strengthened againe with these fomētations ensuing: Take Balme,
Wormewood, grosse Marierom, field Mints, Fennell, and Dill séed, of each a handfull, Mastick, Galingall, Nutmegs, Squinant, Mirtle seed, and Coriander, of each thrée dragmes, wild Vine leaues and the blossomes, halfe a handfull; beate all grosse togither, and séeth them in thicke wine, and vse it as aforesayd. Item, take garden Mints, Balme, Wormewood and Roses, of each one handfull, Cammomill, wild Vine leaues, Betony, Rosemary, of each halfe a handfull, Calmus halfe an ounce; beaten all togither grosse, put it in two bags, each one a quarter of a yard long: then séeth them in red wine, and a little water, and then layd vpon the stomacke, sometime the one, and sometime the other. This fomenting must be so continued the space of a quarter of an houre, and afterwards are you to vse the prescribed salue with the spices, and weare one of the foresayd plaisters vpon it. But if so be that the scowring or laske of ye belly will not stay, then must boxing cups be set vpon the shoulders vnpickt, and taken off and on. The like is also to be done for continuall vo∣mits, and to set a great cup vpon the Nauell, to the end thereby to draw the matter downe∣wards: And in case that the sicke body can sléepe with these cups so fastened, it is so much the better. There is also often times to be holden before his nose, Saunders, Roses, and such like things for to smell vnto them. Also some do counsell to take for this scowring (if it continue) the stalks of Tamariske being scraped cleane, and to powder them, & then put thereto as much Harts tong as these foresayd powders, the quantitie of two handfuls, powring then vpon it thrée pints of wine: of which wine he is alwayes to drinke his first draught sitting at the table. This wine is also especiall good for the Milt or Spléene. If there befall swouning, then must there be giuen to the sicke body two graines of Muske tempered in wine: for this strengtheneth much the vitall spirits. In like manner is Hen broth and Lambe broth good for him, tempered with a little of the iuice of Quinces. Let the patient also haue rosted Pullets cut in péeces vnder his nose; for the smell thereof doth much comfort. Also let him chew Frankinsence, and swallow down the same treatable. At the last temper to∣gither fine Bolus and Camfer, of each one scruple, and temper them with old wine, and drinke it: it doth coole and strengthen the stomacke. All that is hitherto rehearsed, is to be vsed whilest the parbraking yet endureth. But if it stay, and the stomacke begin to retaine the meate, then is the patient to drinke good old strong wine, and compose himself to sléepe,Trocisci de Olibano. and also take of the Trociscos de Olibano the waight of halfe a dragme, which is thus prepared. Take fine Bolus and Frankinsence, of each one ounce and a quarter, Cucubes, Cardamom, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Camfere, Gallia muscata, Cloues, of each three quarters of an ounce; make thereof Trociscos with old wine: these are especiall good against parbraking. Item, take the iuice of sower Pomegranats as much as you please, and when it hath stood one night, and the cleare is powred off, then séeth it to the thicknesse of hony. When it is taken from the fire, and whilest that it is hot put some Mints vnto it; so let it coole, and then take out the herbes againe. This may be vsed warme or how one will, and is called at the Apotheca∣ries Rob de granatis. After the same manner you may also make Rob of the iuice of Quinces.Rob de grana∣tis. For this is also requisite the sirupe of Veriuice, and of Mirtles. But if so be that there cannot be gotten any of the foresayd things for the foresayd sirupes, then take Wine, Plantaine, and Rose water. Now for as much as in this our methode we are come to the Laske or flixe of the belly, which is commonly caused through a weake stomacke and diseased Liuer, therefore it is now requisite that we discourse of all other sorts of Lasks whatsoeuer; but first of all we will make a generall discourse of them. Of the Flixe, Laske, or scowring by stoole. §. 13. FIrst, it hapneth often in haile people, who haue a plethoricke body, and do eate and drinke much, that they get a Laske, which commeth not often vpon them, continueth not long, also not otherwise then of a strong nature, who séeketh to vnburthen her of superfluities, like as it commeth to passe, that thereby the patient findeth great ease. This scowring hath no néed of any remedie, vnlesse it be caused of ouergreat weaknesse, for the which the same counsell is to be vsed
which is prescribed against ye flixe of the belly Lienteria, so that at this present there is nothing more to be written thereof. If so be then that this scowring of the belly be taken for a disease, then is it first to be vnderstood, that the same is caused through many inward members of the body, and also of diuers other causes, like as shal be hereafter taught immediatly, that the same cannot be ascribed to any one thing. And for that we should not describe this kind of laske by peece meales here and there, we will now here ascribe this flixe to the stomacke (as is already expressed:) the which if it be no euident cause of this scowring, yet notwithstanding it is a great helpe to the same: we will then afterwards adde vnto it all that appertaineth vnto it, as the constraint to the stoole, and binding of the body, and all that is good for it. But first of all we must here rehearse certaine rules which are to be obserued for all sorts of lasks: wherof the first is, that no scowring or laske is to be stayed before the fourth day, if so be the patient be able to suffer the same without extreme faintnesse. Secondly, when you wil euer vse astringent reme∣dies, then must the same be alwayes done before meate, to the end that the meate which is ta∣ken after them might be stayed vntill it were digested. Thirdly, this is to be noted of all bin∣ding meates, of Chestnuts, & such like. Fourthly, when the laske is of heate, then are the reme∣dies to be vsed which are cold of nature, and for the scowring of cold, contrary remedies. And because that in ye cold scowring the digestiue vertue is very feeble, warme things are to be vsed, according to the importance of the case. Fiftly, if so be that there do come a cough to this scow∣ring, then are all sowre things to be forborne, and all those which bind much. Sixtly, it is very good for all lasks to force the body to sweating, and to annoint it much with oyle of Cammo∣mill and Dill, thereby to draw out the matter, and to open the pores. Seuenthly, cups are to be set vpon the belly, and kept vpon it foure houres long. Eightly, he is to be restrained and kept from all Fruits, except Chestnuts, which may bind if they will. Ninthly, rest and sléepe are especiall good for all flixes: so is also contrariwise bad, great labour, & other motions of the body. Tenthly, when, as in the red or bloudy flixe the vppermost guts are excoriated, then is the remedy to be ministred in at the mouth: & if the lower guts be perished, then must Clisters & suppositories be ministred beneath. Eleuenthly, if the excoriation of the bowels be aboue and beneath, then are the remedies to be vsed aboue and beneath. And that we may come to the originall, the learned do name thrée Species of flixes or lasks: as namely, Lienteriam, Diarrhaeam, (vnder which is contained the fluxe of the Liuer) and Dysen∣teriam: but what difference is betwéene these laskes, that shall in their proper description be declared. First, this is here alwayes to be noted, that all laskes be moued of inward or outward causes, as vnhealthy meates, vnruly life, eating of any venimous things, also heate or cold of the time. The inward causes may proceede out of the head, as if any humors do fall out of the head into the lower parts of the body, be it into the stomacke, or into the vppermost or vnder∣most bowels: likewise also into the small veines Mesaraicae, into the Liuer, Milt, and sometimes also into the whole body, like as when the same is too full of humors, or too much wasted away, euen as it may be séene in the consumption Phthisi, Hectica, and the pestilent Feuer, out of all which the expert Phisitions do take and discerne sundry signes and obseruations. Of the Laske Lienteria of Cholera and Heate. §. 14. THis is an infirmitie of the retentiue vertue of the stomacke, with the slipperi∣nesse of the guts, wherby it hapneth that the meate taken very suddenly with∣out digestion, like as it was receiued, passeth away by the stoole. The cause of this scowring may be great cold and moysture, which doth so benumme naturall heate, that the meate cannot digest, neither can the stomacke retaine and kéepe it. Contrarywise, may this laske be also caused through out∣ward heate, which doth so discusse the naturall warmth, and cause it to euaporate, that there∣by ye digestion is vtterly ouerthrowne. In like manner also, this flixe commeth through stripes, falles, thrusts, and bathing in cold water, distemperature of the stomacke, and of other parts, debilitie of the retentiue and strength of the expulsiue vertue, a cold complexion, (for that it is seldome caused through heate) impostumes of the stomacke, which expelleth the meate and drinke, as things whereby the stomacke is hurt. Item, it doth also come to passe, that the vow∣els
be too slipperie, or that there is too much meate, or that it be hurtfull, whereby it doth make a great disturbance in the guts. If so be that the meates be not kept or holden in the stomacke, but before the due time, with∣out great alteration, through the laske be expelled, with a gnawing in the stomacke, and with thirst, and when before meate there commeth forth a little corrupted matter; then may it be well concluded that it is Lienteria, which is caused of Cholera. To cure this, and all other scow∣rings (of whatsoeuer causes they procéede) this common rule following is to be obserued: to wit, that all those things (wherewith you purpose to stay it) are to be vsed before meate, then doth the same presse the meate downewards, and increaseth the laske, like as in the former 13. §. hath bene taught. But to procéede with this laske (wherein the meate is not digested) first giue to the sicke bo∣dy the iuice of Pomegranats, burnt Iuorie, and Roses, of each one dragme. For this is also good, boyled Veriuice, Raspes, Butchers broome, and the iuice of Quinces. Whilst that the body is strong inough, and the sicknesse hath not as yet gotten the maistry, and that he may tollerate it, then must the Cholera be purged, and especially with yellow Mi∣robalanes, afterwards he is to vse cooling, astringent, and binding things, and to be forbidden all that is hote. These Sirupes ensuing are passing good, as namely, sirupe of Veriuice, Quinces, Peares, Apples, Pomegranates, and Raspes, moreouer certaine Simples also which are worthy to be remembred; like as Hypocistis, blossomes of Pomegranates, Gals, iuice of Sloes, Roses, Araby Gum, sealed earth, fine Bolus, burnt Iuorie, Camfer, Pomegranat séedes without iuice, Purslaine séede, séedes of Sorrell, Coriander, Plantaine, and Mirtles, the yellow séede of the Rose, Saunders, Corrall, Dragon bloud, Poppie séede, Horstailes, Knot∣grasse, wild Vine leaues, the iuice of sharpe Plantaine and the séede, and chiefly when they be parched, and such like moe. The Fruits which are fit for this disease be Quinces, Seruices, Medlars, wild Peares, blacke Cherries, vnripe Mulberies, and such like Fruits more which do bind and coole. You may also giue Trociscos de Spodio, two or thrée dragmes, mingled with the water of Knotgrasse, or Plantaine, and because that we haue before spoken much of them, and shall be vsed often hereafter, we shall here learne how to prepare them: Take Roses, burnt Iuorie, (which is Spodium whereof they haue their name) Sorrell seedes, the séedes of Butchers broome,Trocisci de Spodio. blos∣somes of Pomegranates, and Gum of Araby, of each a like quantitie: make thereof Trociscos, each of the waight of a quarter of an ounce, and giue it them to drinke, as is sayd, with one ounce of the iuice of Quinces. Another: Take Roses one ounce and a halfe, burnt Iuory one ounce & a quarter, the séedes of Sorrell thrée quarters of an ounce, Purslaine séede, prepared Coriander seedes, and peeled Butchers broome séede, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Starch, blossomes of Pomegranats, and Barberies, of each one quarter of an ounce, parched Gum one drag. and a halfe, temper all togither with Veriuice. These Trocisks are good for all Agues which be caused of Cholera, & that haue a laske admixed, also for all tumors of the stomacke, and continuall thirst. Other Trociskes. Take fine Bolus, sealed earth, Corrall, Saunders, Sumach, Barberies, Quincekernels, blossomes and pils of Pomegranates, Gals, of each one dragme, beate them all small togither, and temper them with the iuice of Plantaine and of Wormewood, and then forme them into Trocisces when you will vse them; then take a dragme or twaine thereof with Milke wherein glowing pibbles are slaked. But if then this scowring and the Ague do not weare away with all the vse of these foresayd things, then take fine Bolus, sealed earth, and burnt Iuorie, of each one quarter of an ounce, Amber, Roses, blossomes of Pomegranates, the iuice of Sloes, Hypocistis, and Cinnamome, of each one dragme and a halfe, make them into powder, take thereof fiue dragmes, Buttermilke sixe ounces, and giue it him at one time, to wit, before noone. If so be that the stomacke be hurt through the choler, (which may be perceiued hereby, if there come any corruption or matter with the stoole) then take Barly water and Hony water, of each thrée spoonfuls, and giue it the sicke body to drinke, it cleanseth all that is excoriated. Af∣terwards he shal vse this following to heale withall: Take Dragagant, Gum, Mastick, Fran∣kinsence, Amber, of each one dragme, stamp all these into a subtile powder, and make therof pils with the iuice of Wormewood, whereof he is to take twaine euery morning.
Plaisters are also very requisite for this, whereof here follow twaine: Take the iuice of Medlars, Seruices, gréene Pomegranate pils and the flowers, of each one ounce, 15. or 16. Prunes, whereof the stones be taken out, the iuice of Quinces, red Wine, of each sixe ounces, oyle of Mirtles and Quinces, of each thrée ounces, Masticke, Colophonia, yellow Rose seedes, Sloes, and Rye meale of each one quarter of an ounce, the middlemost pils of Chestnuts, thrée dragmes, Waxe as much as is needfull, and a little Vineger: spread it on a cloth, and lay it ouer the whole belly. The second. Take the iuice of Plantaine thrée ounces, Rose water, Vineger, of each one ounce, Butchers broome séede, Barberries, Mirobalans Chebuli, Indi, Emblici, Bellirici, Citrini, of each two ounces, red Corall, red & white Saunders, yellow Rose séede, Masticke, of each one dragme, blossomes and pils of Pomegranates, Gals, of each halfe an ounce, Lentill meale as much as is needfull for to make a méetly soft plaister. This plaister is of a maruellous opera∣tion, if there be any vnnaturall heate with the laske. His diet is to be all manner of sower and cold things, wherewith he must also dresse his boy∣led and rosted meates. He must temper his drinke with Rose water wherein Butchers broome séede hath bene steeped: parched Rice decocted in Goates milke, and parched Barley sodden in Almond milke are very requisite for him. All that which is hot of nature, and is laxatiue, must he forbeare; as also all that doth augment Choleram. But if this scouring be caused through weakenesse of the retentiue power, be it of the sto∣macke or of the bowels, then are those parts to be comforted, and that with odoriferous and binding medicines, as followeth: Take Cypers rootes, Masticke, Calmus, Smallage, and Co∣min, (which hath first bene stéeped in Vineger) Gals, Cypers nuts and the leaues, Mirtle séed, Raisins stones, dried Pomegranate kernels, Frankinsence, and Masticke, of each a like much: make a powder thereof, and giue it in the morning fasting to drinke one quarter of an ounce, with good wine or steeled milke. Outwardly annoint the stomacke and the whole belly with oyle of Masticke or Wormewood, and weare vpon it a plaister of Masticke: He is also to vse Marmalade. But when this scowring causeth no gnawing or griping in the stomacke, nor yet yéeldeth any corrupt matter from it, but onely a tough slimy substance, and when there is no great thirst with it, but onely some belching; then is it a certaine signe that this scowring is caused through Phlegma. For this, the patient is to vse al such things as extenuate and loose this slime, as Mustard seed, salt fish, and such like. Afterwards shall he force himselfe to vomite, with salt, Vineger, sodden Hony, or with some other thing, which expelleth flegme. And if that will not suffice, then vse this following. Take Aloes one ounce, the inside of Coloquinte, and Indie salt, of each halfe an ounce, Turbith one dragme; make pils thereof: and you are to take of these but one Pill at once. For this disease are the purgations commodious, which hereafter be described against the paine of the stomacke through Phlegma. Some other do write a more proper cure, to wit, Take sirupe of Wormewood and Mints, of each thrée ounces, temper them, and drinke thereof at each time two ounces, with thrée ounces of the decoction wherein Pease, Mints, and Spike were boyled. Afterwards purge with the pils called Stomachicae: Also vse vomiting herewith, as is before rehearsed; for it is very commodious in this case, if it weaken not too much. For his meate he is to vse all dry things, as rosted field foules, and chiefly rosted Larkes, Turtle doues, and such like as do not sodainly passe away: yet alwayes a little at once, and no more than the stomacke is well able to beare. This medicine following is not onely for Lienteria, but also for the laske called Diarrhea, very good: it detaineth the meates receiued in the stomacke; which also with the bowels, it doth warme, strengthen and dry. Take Cypers nuts and the leaues, dryed Mints, Masticke, Frankinsence with his rindes, grosse Cinnamom, Mace and Galingall, of each thrée dragmes, Cresses séedes, Comin, and prepared Coriander (all togither a little parched) of each halfe an ounce, Laudanum, red Sty∣rax, Ambra, Citron pils, of each one drag. and a halfe, Lignum Aloes and Spica, of each one drag. make thereof Trocisces of the weight of one dragme and a halfe, and giue the patient thereof at euery time, as well before dinner, as before supper, with some milke, wherin pibble stones be
slaked. Also you may minister of this powder alone one drag. or to make a confection of it with Sugar. This patient is also to vse some sowre and salt things before and after meate, as Ca∣pers and Oliues, which be requisite also for this purpose. For these cold phlegmatick scowrings be these simple, warming, and binding remedies very good: parched Comin, Ameos, Annis, Frankinsence, Mirrhe, Styrax, Mastick, Nutmegs, Cypers nuts, Laudanum, parched Rubarb, Wormewood, Mints, Lignum Aloes, rootes of Cypers, Bucks and Hares rennet. Of cōfections and confected things may he vse confected Ginger, Diagalanga, Diatrion pipereon, de Cymino, Mar∣malad with Spices, and sometimes Treacle and Mithridate. Item, there is also very profi∣table for this, strong Wine, as Muscadell, Malmsey, and such like, and otherwhiles a good pull, or hartie draught drunke thereof. But for a common drinke he shall vse cleare white Wine, which is méetely strong, which can well heate and dry the stomacke. Hereafter be many things described, which may be vsed with aduantage for this scowring, with this condition alwayes, to discerne warmth and cold. Of the Laske Diarrhaea. §. 15. THis loosenesse of the belly is thus described: Diarrhaea is a watrish laske, with griping, but without excoriation of the bowels, and without heate, caused di∣uersly, whereby the body is consumed and diseased. This scouring is caused of all humours of the body, that is, of Bloud, Cholera, Phlegma, and of Melancho∣lia, and procéedeth not alwayes from some particular part of the body, but ra∣ther from the whole body, as through weakenesse of nature, in such as let hands and feete fall through great weakenesse. The learned do discouer sixe kinds of causes of this Diarrhaea: whereof the first is caused of the Gall and the Liuer: the second of the stomack onely, but sometimes out of the Liuer also, which two are the principallest members, amongst which the other fowre be comprehended. Thirdly, this scouring is also very well caused through the obstruction of the small veines which are called Mesaraicae. Fourthly, of the Milt. Fiftly, this laske is also sometimes caused of the braines. Sixtly, through windines, whereof we shall hereafter write more at large. When as now this scowring is caused of the Liuer and Gall, then is Cholera very abun∣dant; or if the same be but very little, yet is the same so hote and so sharp, that nature cannot abide her gnawing and heate, but seeketh to expell the same by all meanes possible, so that the perfect digestion might not thereby be weakened: therefore you haue for this first infirmitie these signes following, to wit, when the meate digested passeth away with a subtle, ill coloured and whitish watrishnes, then it is a signe that the Liuer is feebled and ouercold. For this, there is to be giuen to the patient the confection of Iron drosse which is Scoria Ferri, or some other things, which warme the Liuer, and strengthen it. For which, you shall finde here before sundry remedies, where we haue spokē of Lienteriae, which do warme and strengthen the inward parts in such like lasks, which you may vse at this present, each alone, or mixed: here follow the re∣medies which be requisite for this intent. Take Trociscos de Spodio, Rubarb, and winter Cherries, of each one scruple, beate them all small, and make thereof with Agrimony water sixe or seauen pils, take them euery mor∣ning with Smalladge water. Item, take Mirtle seed, and Nut blossomes, of each one dragme, Amber, Zeduary, of each one scruple, beate and temper them all togither, and part them in fiue equall parts. This plaister following is also to be prepared: Take Annis, Comin, Cresses séede parched togither, and Frankinsence, of each thrée drag. the iuice of Wormewood one ounce and a halfe, Rose water two ounces, strong Vineger one ounce, beaten Cypers nuts, as much as sufficeth for to make a plaister with it: these being made, then lay it warme vpon the Liuer and Sto∣macke, and vpon the parts adioyning. You may also vse this salue following: Take oyle of wild Roses one ounce and a halfe, oyle of Spica one ounce, Mastick and Rubarb, of each one dragme, a little Waxe, melt the same in the oyles, and when it beginneth to coole, mixe the rest with it. Item, take Spec. Triasantali one dragme, fine Bolus, Trociscos de Spodio, of each halfe a drag.
Mastick one scruple, oyle of Wormewood, of Capers, of each half an ounce, a little Waxe, make a salue of them. But if this scowring do procéede of heate, then are cooling and binding medicines to be vsed for it, like as herebefore in Lienteria, where it is sufficiently discoursed, Triasantali, Diapenidionis, of each one quarter of an ounce, red Corrall, and prepared Coriander, of each halfe a dragme, Quince kernels, Sorrell séede, Raisin stones, of each one scruple, Cinnamome, Frankinsence, of each fiue graines, Conserue of dry Roses one ounce, Rose water two ounces, white Sugar nine ounces: seeth the Sugar in the foresayd water, and make a confection of it. Item, take old conserue of Roses, and Marmalade, of each one ounce, sirupe of Mirtles, as much as sufficeth for to make therewith a Confection. Another. Take the Species of Diarrhodon Abbatis, pre∣pared Wolues liuer, and Rubarb, of each halfe an ounce, Sugar which is clarified with Rose water, as much as you please: make a confection thereof, or cast Tabulats of it. You are also to mixe amongst it as much burnt Iuorie as you please. Or take at the Apothecaries the confection called Diacracoma, or Diacurcuma, and Currans, of each one ounce, Rubarb, prepared liuer of a Wolfe, of each one dragme, burnt Iuorie halfe a dragme, Philonium Persicum one dragme Syrupi de Byzantijs, as much as is needfull for to make therewith a Confection, then take alwayes therof about the third day one quarter of an ounce, or a little more at once. This following is also very good: Take old conserue of Roses foure ounces, Marmalade two ounces, prepared Coriander one dragme, Nutmegs halfe a dragme, confected Mirobalans Chebuli one ounce, cleansed Pistacies halfe an ounce, Almonds thrée dragmes, beate them all small togither, and then make a confection of it with the iuice of Quinces: sirupe of dried Roses doth commonly stay all scowrings. Take cleansed rootes of Burres, and séeth them vntill they be mellow, afterwards fry them in Butter, and eate them. Item, take a Nutmeg be it great or small, let it sweate well in hote ashes, and eate it as it is, or strew it vpon a rosted Partridge, or some such like thing. Or take a Turtle Doue, prepare it, and fill it with new Waxe, with Mirtles, & Butchers Broome seede, let it then be rosted by a mild fire, and afterward eate it, it bindeth maruellously. It is also re∣quired by expert Phisitions, that new layd Egs are to be fryed in Waxe. Other do take an Eg, and rost it vpon a hote tyle, and strew vpon it the powder of Nutmegs. But if it be not giuen at due time, then doth it bring more dammage than commoditie. This powder following are you also to prepare: Take Species Aromatici Rosati, one drag. Cinnamome one dragme and a halfe, prepared Coriander two scruples, Roses and red Cor∣rall, of each one scruple, Sugar foure ounces. Item, take parched Cresses séed and Masticke, of each one dragme, giue him this with the sirupe of Quinces. Some do giue Cresses séede alone, with the sirupe of Quinces. We will now recite certaine Potions: Take Mirtle séede one drag. giue it him with raine water or Plantaine water thrée ounces, and let him drinke it. Or take Liuerwort one hand∣full, Endiue rootes, Fennell, Smallage, Butchers broome, Sperage, and Parsley, of each two handfuls, Agrimony halfe a handfull, Currans one ounce: cut all that is to be cut, and let it be sodden in Pullet broth or water, vntill that the third part be wasted, then drinke therof a cruse full, and temper amongst it halfe a drag. of prepared Foxe lights. Item, take Tormentill one dragme, giue the patient to drinke thereof foure or fiue times in red Wine. Or take the rindes of a Peare trée one handfull, a good pinte of red Wine: let them séeth to∣gither so long as one may séeth an hard Egge, and drinke a good hartie draught of it very warme. But for his accustomed drinke he may prepare this following: Take about 50. Sloes, & powre vpon it about a good halfe pinte of séething Wine, afterwards couer it close, & let it be cold togither: this being done, then powre all togither into thrée pintes of Wine, and drinke thereof a good draught. A rosted Quince peare eaten early in the morning, is also very good. Some do say that one must drinke Béere or Wine, which hath stoode a while vpon Bolus. For this, is also stéeled wa∣ter good, wherein is slaked Stéele, Iron, Gold, Siluer, or pibble stones; yea, all the patients meate is to be drest with it. Item, take of the pizzle of a Hart as much as you please, shauen or grated smal, and put it in your drinke. Item, take a dried Otters liuer, beate it to powder, and drinke thereof the quan∣titie
of a Beane with warme Milke, or with red Wine, it is sayd that it is tried. Likewise is commended Plantaine decocted in Vineger, and the broth being drunken. The water also of Oaken leaues doth stop much, being drunken warme. The like doth also the iuice of Sloes, with the stones of Raisins being beaten togither, and the water distilled thereof and drunken. You haue also in the first part, the first Chapter, and 3. §. a good water of the crums of burnt bread, which is especiall good for this scowring or laske. This plaister following is also especially commended for this: Take broad Plantaine xij. ounces, the leaues of the Pomegranate trée, Comfrey, Daisies, & the leaues of Palma Christi, of each two ounces, (being all gréene) the séede of Butchers Broome, Gals, Mirtle seede, of each one ounce, prepared Coriander one ounce, sealed earth halfe an ounce, Dragon bloud one quar∣ter of an ounce, fine Bolus thrée ounces, Saffron halfe a drag. Mace thrée drag. Gum, Draga∣gant, both parched, of each halfe an ounce: first beate the leaues, and séeth them in three pintes of water, then put vnto it three ounces of red Vineger, then let it séeth well againe, and straine the decoction, then stamp that which is boyled with all the rest. Lastly, temper halfe a dragme of Camfer with it: and make a supple plaister of it, and lay it ouer the whole Belly. If so be that this scouring procéede from the stomacke, (euen as it may as well as from the Liuer) then hath the same the like cause, to wit, Phlegma and Cholera. And hereby it may be discerned that it procéedeth from the stomacke, if so be that there appeare no féeblenesse of the Liuer, and if so be that which the patient doth auoyd be very white and thin, and that the sto∣macke be grieued. The chiefe cause is, that many superfluous humors do aggrauate the same: or, that there is much meate and drinke togither in the stomacke, and especially when as both these things do concurre, to wit, many superfluous humors, and much meate and drinke. So that then the meate and drinke is of necessitie for a time expelled out of the stomacke, be it through weakenesse of the retentiue, or through the efficacie of the expulsiue vertue, or that the digestion be of it selfe so faint, that the meate thereby as halfe digested must passe through the stomacke. And to finde good aduice for this, the stomacke must be strengthened and heated, for which is very méete Marmalade with Spices, but especially this powder following: Take dry Pomegranat kernels parched and beaten small one dragme, Caruway, Coriander, both stéeped in Vineger, dried and parched, of each two ounces and a halfe, Lignum Aloes, blossomes of Pomegranats, and Butchers Broome, of each one dragme, make powder of all these, and giue a dragme of it at one time. Item, take Mirobalani Chebuli, which be a little parched, one quarter of an ounce, Mirtle seede one drag. sirupe of Mirtle one ounce, vse this as occasion serueth. Item, take the shales of yellow Mirobalans which be parched, one quarter of an ounce, beate them small, & giue them to drinke with two ounces of Plantaine water. In fine, all sorts of Mirobalans a little par∣ched, are good for all scourings of the belly, of whatsoeuer cause they do procéede. Afterwards, you are to vse the confections of Diacalamintha. In like manner also Annis séede, and rosted hasell nuts. Of the foresaid hasel nuts one may make milke with stéeled water, and also the same being confected with Sugar. Afterwards you must annoint the stomacke with oyle, as namely with the oyle of Masticke, or Frankinsence, & so couer it warme. The pa∣tient must seeth Mastick with red Wine, and drinke the same, if so be that the same go not cleane against him. But if this scouring do come through Cholera, it may be perceiued by the yellow excrements which do smart much in the fundament, as also by the thirst, and by the Ague: Then are you to giue him Trociscos de Spodio, with parched Barly broth, which is made as followeth:Parched Bar∣ley broth. Take par∣ched Barly beaten, and powre so much water vpon it vntill it be well couered, then let it boyle vntill it be very thicke, and afterwards wring it out. Of this decoction are you to take foure ounces, and two or three dragmes of these Trociscos, and then mingle it with so much Iuorie and Gum, as one can drinke at one time. Item, take one drag. and a halfe of yellow Mirobalanes, Chebuli, and Indi, of each one scruple, parched Rubarb foure scruples, Dragagant halfe a drag. steepe all these in two ounces of the iuice of Quinces, one ounce of Endiue water, and halfe an ounce of the water of Pellitory, wring it out hard, and take it luke warme. Item, take Rubarb one drag. or one and a half, parch it, and powne it to powder, and drinke it with thrée ounces of Plantaine water. Take of the best Rubarb one drag. and a halfe, parch it, and beate it to powder, the pils
of Mirobalans Chebuli one dragme, Masticke thrée dragmes, the iuice of Quinces halfe an ounce, the water of broad Plantaine thrée or foure ounces: temper them togither, and drinke it fasting in the morning. Some that be prone to this scowring, do accustome euery wéeke two times to eate one drag. of Rubarb parched. Item, take the confection of Micleta one ounce and a halfe, Trociscos de Spo∣dio one dragme, temper it with thrée ounces of raine water, and drinke it early in the morning. Take yellow Mirobalans and Rubarb, of each one dragme, Dragagant and Gum, of each one scruple, parched togither, Cucubes, fine Bolus, of each halfe a scruple, beaten small togither, then temper with it sufficient sirupe of Mirtles, and when as then you will vse of it, breake it as is aforesayd. A powder wherewith the patients meate is to be strewed: Take good Rubarb one dragme and a half, yellow Mirobalans one quarter of an ounce, both parched, fine Bolus one dragme, yellow Saunders, red Coral, of each one scrup. prepared Pearles one dragme, Trociscos de Spo∣dio one dragme, make thereof a subtile powder. You may also take the waight of one dragme and a halfe with Plantaine water. For this be also Clisters requisite, as hereafter follow: Take the broth of a Lambs head and a Calues head one pinte, séeth oaken leaues in it, broad & picked Plantaine, of each one hand∣full and a halfe, parched Barley halfe a handfull: let them séeth vnto the halfe, then take of this decoction, and put vnto it the yolkes of a couple of Egs brayed well, oyle of Roses two ounces, oyle of Violets two ounces, and then minister this Clister warme. Item, take prepared Coriander, Mirtle séede, Acorne cups, the séedes of Plantaine, and iuice of Sloes, of each one handfull, Fennell, Comin, & Annis, of each halfe a handfull, pils of Pome∣granates two handfuls; let them séeth togither in sufficient water: then take of this decoction twelue or sixtéene ounces, oyle of Roses thrée ounces, Hony of Roses one ounce, Déeres suet two ounces: melt it, and make a Clister of it. Also the decoction of Rice is good, if the cause of this laske be in the lower guts. Hereafter be described commodious pils: Take the stones of all Mirobalanes, beate them when they be well parched, Rubarb parched, fine Bolus, and Amber, of each a like quantitie, make a masse of pils of it, with Dragagant and Gum, dissolued in Plantaine water: but if there be an Ague with it, then vse Barley water. Or take one quarter of an ounce of Rubarb, which is parched, burnt Iuorie one dragme, make pils of it as is before sayd. Item, filed steele one dragme, Cypers nuts one quarter of an ounce, Masticke, Amber, Com∣frey, Daisies, Plantaine séede, of each one scruple, Gum and Dragagant both parched, of each halfe a dragme, Cinnamome, Galingall, and Graines, of each two scruples: make pils thereof with the iuice of Plantaine, for they do bind much. Others mo. Take vnsalted Deeres rennet one dragme, Trociscos de Spodio, De Carabe, De Terra Sigillata, of each one scruple, well parched Rubarb, Plantaine séede also parched, of each halfe a scruple, beate them small togither, make pils of them, with the iuice of Plantaine, when they be tempered with the sirupe of Mirtles, then do they bind the more. Item, take Hypocistis, blossomes of Pomegranates, Butchers Broome, Barberies, Sorrell séede, of each one dragme and a halfe, Purslaine séede, and Plantaine, both parched, of each one quarter of an ounce, Dragon bloud, worme-eaten Galles, the iuice of Sloes, yellow séedes of Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, Henbane séede one scruple, Opium two scruples and a halfe: make pils thereof with the iuice of Plantaine, and forme seauen of a dragme. But note yet, that they be very strong, and that one must not vse many. This following is more gentle: Take Gum, Masticke, Frankinsence, Amber, of each halfe a dragme, temper them with the sirupe of Roses vnto pils, and take alwayes therof twice a day, a little or much before meate, according as the scowring is violent. For this scowring is alwayes good all rost meate, fryed Egs, Rice, and Lettice, (if it be with great heate) Calues féete, conserue of Rosser fruits, Muske Peares, before meales old conserue of Roses, conserue of water Lillies, Marmalade, preserued Bayberies, and also preserued Sloes. The drinke for this patient must be stéeled water, wherein Mirtle séede is decocted, also Harts tong, Wine drunken warme. These Sirupes following are very good, as namely, sirupe
of Mirtles, dried Roses, Mints, & also hony of Roses: for it hath a mild binding, and an astrin∣gent vertue, like as veriuice hath also. The smoke or reke of Frankinsence is also very good. Milke put into Clisters when it is stée∣led is commended for this purpose. Note ye, that all that we haue sufficiently written of before is also good for the red or bloudy flixe, whereof we will shortly hereafter speake and discourse. Of the scowring which proceedeth of the Liuer and Stomacke. §. 16. IT commeth also verily to passe, that the Liuer and the Stomacke do cause this scowring, which is then very dangerous: so that the dropsie called Tympanites is wont to follow it. Therefore is an order made an ordained, what one ought to obserue for this. Wherein first it is néedefull that he forbeare all meates and drinks which be laxatiue, or do in any wise molest the body, as Spinage, Béets, Mallowes, Mercurie, well boyled Colewoorts, and such like. He must also be restrained from new wines, and them that be not very old. Likewise also of all sharpe, salt and sower things, as Radishes, Onions, Garlicke, hard, meates, vnleauened bread, and that which is not well baked. And he must eschue fruits, and specially them that be laxatiue, as Figs, Grapes, Prunes, and such like. In fine, for this sicknesse the patient is to be kept very sober in eating and drinking, and to féede onely vpon that which is light of digestion. He must also abstaine from all violent motions, and that chiefly after meate, from venerie, much watching, and anger. All his meates (be they soddē or rosted) must be drest with Deeres sewet. Secondly, he must beware of many kindes of meates, especially against night. Thirdly, before euery meale he must eate a rosted Quince peare, or foure or fiue Medlars. Fourthly, Lentils are very haile meate for him, if they be drest after this maner: Let them first séeth a little in vineger, after that boyle them with two parts of water and one part of vineger. Fiftly, euery euening he is to take three of these pils ensuing: Take parched Dragagant and Gum, of each one dragme, Butchers Broome séede, Mirtle séede, Acorne cups, burnt Iuorie, Squinant, Roses, Cypers rootes, of each two scruples, whereof make pils with the iuice of Daisies before noone. He is to vse this confection ensuing: Take Marmalade without spices thrée ounces, prepared Coriander and Mastick, of each one dragme, temper them with the iuice of Quinces, and vse each time halfe an ounce or more. Also once euery eight dayes take two of these pils: Take Trociscos de Spodio, one quarter of an ounce, parched Rubarbe halfe a dragme, burnt Iuorie and parched Dragagant, of each one scruple, Hares rennet, or the rennet of a yong Goate or Kid, one dragme and a halfe: make pils thereof, and vse them as all the rest. This plaister also following is to be made, and worne vpon the nauell: Take two ounces of Rosin, Cypers nuts one dragme & a halfe, Plantaine séede, the iuice of Sloes, burnt Iuorie, Roses, Irō drosse that is prepared, of each one dragme, Mace two scruples, but the Rosin must be boyled in red vineger. When it is sufficiently sodden, and almost cold, then temper all the foresayd Species with it, spread of it vpon a péece of leather the quantitie of a quarter of a yard foure square, and lay this plaister vpon the nauel downwards. As often as the patient goeth to stoole, he is to fume his fundament with this powder ensuing: Take Colophonia, Gallia Muscata and red Styrax, of each halfe a dragme, Lignum Aloes one dragme, red Corall, burnt Iuorie, Sandaraca, of each two scruples: powne them all togither, and temper them all togither. After∣wards strew some of it vpon hot coales. It is also good aduise that there be alwayes boyled in his meate, as much Comfrey as the bignesse of a great finger. Lastly, he must continually weare this bag ensuing vpon his stomacke: Take Mirtle séede, prepared Coriander, Marierom and Nep, of each one handfull, Mace halfe an ounce, Masticke, Gallia Muscata, red Styrax, red Corall and Sandaraca, of each one quarter of an ounce Lignum Aloes one dragme and a halfe, parched Comin half an ounce, temper them, & vse it as aforesayd. Thus far haue we spoken of this Scowring, and of both the causes of it, as of the stomacke and of the liuer, and also how they both do come togither. The third cause of this Diarrhaea is the obstruction of the small veines, and are called of the Grecians Mesenterion or Mesaraeon, for that as the stomacke and the entrailes haue done their
duties, so if these veines do not sucke out the nourishment, then doth nature expel the meate in manner of a thicke pap, with paine in the right side and in the bowels, and so out of the body, especially if one haue eaten much grosse and swéete meate before. Also this scowring may be well caused of an impostume, which might be about the small veines, or about the vpper guts, at which time is commonly perceiued an ague, heate and paine: which obstruction doth also procéede for the most part, of grosse and tough humours. For this disease vomiting is one of the best remedies. Also this sirupe following is to be vsed: Take the rootes of Smallage, Parsley, Butchers broome, Sperage, grasse and Cicorie, of each one dragme, the séedes of Smallage and of Parsley, Comin and Fennell, of each one ounce: let this séeth well togither, and wring it out, and to this Colature adde halfe a pint of hony, and boyle it againe, and clarifie it as behoueth. Giue thereof to the patient euery morning foure or fiue ounces. Also the séedes of Smallage, Ameos, and Parsley decocted in wine, may be vsed for this, being giuen the patient to drinke: in like manner parched Rubarbe with wine or En∣diue water. This patient shall also oftentimes, but at each time eate a little, & take euer after it some penetrating things, as Diacalaminthum one dragme and a halfe before meate, and halfe a dragme after meate. His drinke must be likewise old white wine. Also to take otherwhiles some Treacle is very commodious. It is also very good, that the belly be strōgly rubbed before and after noone with a rough cloth. The fourth cause of this laske procéedeth from the milt, the which may be knowen hereby, to wit, when his excrements are a blacke and darke gray, if the paine be in the left side, if ye pa∣tient be melancholicke, quiet and tractable. When the matter is very sharpe and blackish, then is there great danger with it. But if it happen in the end of a quartaine ague, or of any other sicknesse, then doth it bring ease with it, and is a signe of health. What is fit for this, you may sée hereafter, where we shall discourse of the Milt. The fift cause procéedeth from the braines, which may be discerned by the paine of the head: also by the rheume, and by the slime of the mouth, which after sléepe runneth out of the same, & is also expelled by stoole. These diseases are to be cured like as all other rheumaticke diseases, whereof you finde sufficient discourse in the second Part, the 12. Chapter, and 2. §. But it is especially commended, that parched Melilot shall be layd vpon the forehead. Otherwhiles a bag with Cammomill and Roses, and so to gouerne himselfe, as abouesayd, in the second cause of the stomacke. The last cause is windinesse, which puffeth vp the stomacke, spoyleth digestion, and prouo∣keth a scowring, like as hereafter shal be taught in the description of windinesse of the stomack. It is also counselled to euery such patient (like as is often shewed before) that he must be very sober in eating and drinking, yea he must suffer hunger as much as is possible, and that he ex∣ercise himselfe well before meales, and vse the Confection Diacyminum or Diacalamintha, which do strengthen his stomacke, and let him gouerne himselfe in all things else, as hath bene sayd before in Lienteria. Of the Laske Dysenteria, called the red Flixe. §. 17. THis name Dysenteria, is of the Grecians so called, being an vlceration or excoria∣tion of the Entrailes, and is thus described: Dysenteria is a paine of the Entrailes, which enflameth, fretteth, and excoriateth the same: so that with the matter of the scowring, bloud is auoyded; and it causeth much gnawing, which maketh the pa∣tient to go often to the stoole. Or thus: Dysenteria is a scowring, with an exulceration of the bowels, which is increased through outward causes, as heate, cold, drinke, hard meate. The causes of this noysome scow∣ring are sharpe humors, which passe through the bowels, and there exulcerate the same, fret & take away their fatnes. Item by the taking of too sharpe medicines, as Diagridion, Esula, and Néesing woort, or when too much of these hath bene taken at once. Also this scowring is occasioned, when the body is ouercharged with Cholera, Melancholia, or Phlegma, of which superfluities, if the expulsiue vertue be strong, nature séeketh to vnburthen her selfe. Likewise also, when the meate in the stomacke, or humours in the veines do pu∣trifie.
In like manner also of great and long alteration of the ayre, be it in hote ayre, dry ayre, or when these méete togither: like as dry ayre it selfe is wont to cause Choleram. Item, of the vse of such fruits which do quickly putrifie: therefore it is not commendable, and especially that children should eate the same. The signes of this red scouring or bloudy Flixe are these, which do not come suddainly vpon one: also before it getteth the masterie, it prouoketh paine and gripings in the bowels, and also round about the stomacke. This scouring likewise burneth and pricketh sore, whereupon doth first follow the scraping of the bowels, mixed with a little bloud, vntill it corrode somewhat dee∣per into the bowels; then is the paine felt most aboue the Nauell: and if so be that the disease be in the great guts, then is the paine felt most vnder the Nauell. Also the scraping of the lower∣most guts are much fatter then of the vppermost: and it doth come also in greater abundance, with many moe such like demonstrations. But there be discribed two sorts of Dysenteria, wherof the first is here before discouered: The second hath the name of Dysenteria vniustly, by reason that it without scraping of the bowels, and very sodainly falleth vpon one, with much bloud. This with good right is to be called ra∣ther an Hepaticall Flixe than Dysenteria: but we will here first of all write of the right Dysente∣ria, and afterwards of the Flixe of the liuer. If we desire to preuent this red Flixe or Dysenteria, then is the same to be done both through outward and also inward meanes. But first we will shew what is best to be vsed inwardly for it: wherefore you are first to keepe in your memory the common rules which haue bin rehear∣sed before in the Laske Lienteria, to wit, that all those things wherewith you will stay this scou∣ring, be alwayes ministred before meates, for that after meate these binding medicines cause a sicke body to scoure the more. For this scowring or red Flixe all expert Phisitions do vse commonly at the first parched Mi∣robalanes, and chiefly the yellow, stéeped in Plantaine water, and put also vnto it parched Ru∣barb, beaten to powder. But the same must not be infused but in substance and powder, like as you haue séene before in some potions, for the scowring of Cholera. Item, take parched seedes of Fleawoort two ounces and a halfe, séedes of Plantaine one ounce and a quarter, Gum, fine Bolus, of each thrée dragmes, in the iuice of Quinces defecate. Or take dried Quinces, beate them to powder, and giue thereof one dragme and a halfe, with Plantaine water, once or twice a day, wherewith you may also temper parched Nutmegs, and the séedes of Plantaine. Item, take parched Gum one ounce, sealed earth three quarters of an ounce, fine Bolus halfe an ounce; make powder thereof, and giue of it one dragme and a halfe at once. Item, take Shepheards purse, S. Iohns woort, and Penniroyall, of each a like quanti∣tie: make a powder of it: and giue two dragmes thereof at once in the morning early, with a new layd eg: this stayeth the scouring euidently. Burnt Harts horne washt in Rose water or Plantaine water, a dragme, or a dragme and a halfe, taken with wine wherein a little Draga∣gant is dissolued, is a very expert medicine, if it be takē twice a day. The like also of one dragme of the rennet of a yong Hare taken with wine. Another: Take broad Plantaine séede, and Colombine séede, both parched and beaten to powder, of each a like quantitie, and giue each time thereof two scruples, or one dragme, with red Wine. Item take small beaten Bloudstone, well washed in Plantaine water, thrée drag. red Corall one dragme and a halfe, rootes of Tormentill, and Trociscos de Spodio, of each one dragme, shauē Iuorie, burnt Harts horne, of each two scruples, prepared Pearles one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus halfe a dragme: beaten them all small, and take two dragmes of this powder in the morning with Wine. You may also strew the meate with the same. Item, burne Frogs to ashes in a pot, and vse thereof as before, for they haue a maruellous operation to staunch bloud. In like sort may for many purposes be vsed Mirtle séede, the séedes of Butchers brooome, Pomegranate kernels, sealed earth, fine Bolus, and other binding medicines, which are to be beaten to powder, and as the case requireth, may be vsed well inough for the red flixe. Here followeth now a notable confection against all species of scouring, and the same may be vsed after what sort one will. Take pils and blossomes of Pomegranats, Gals, and Acorne cups, of each one quarter of an ounce, Raisin stones, Mirtle séeds, burnt hasell nuts, dry Pome∣granate kernels, yellow Rose séede, the iuice of Sloes, Butchers broome séede, of each two oun∣ces,
red Corall, Frankinsence, Masticke, white and black Poppie séede, parched Gum, the séede of Fleawort, Starch, Dragon bloud, of each one dragme and a halfe, Sugar sixe ounces; tem∣per them well togither, whereof you may make a confection with Sugar, or with Plantaine water, or Tabulates; or strew the powder alone vpon the meate. You may also make pils thereof, which are to be vsed in the morning betimes, and in the euening two houres after sup∣per: but of the confection may be vsed thrée or foure times a day, like as necessitie requireth, at each time one quarter or halfe an ounce. Here followeth yet another, which may be vsed after the same manner: Take Butchers broome seede, fine Bolus, and Gum, of each thrée dragmes and one scruple, Dragon bloud, and burnt Iuorie, of each one dragme and seauen graines, Cloues strigs, Annis, of each foure scrup. Hypocistis one scruple and thrée graines, Bloud stone two dragmes & a halfe, red and white Cor∣rall, of each two scruples, Amber one quarter of an ounce, Comfrey, Daisies, Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce and one scruple, blossomes of Pomegranats, Dragagant, of each one drag. and seauen graines, Mirtle séed thrée dragmes and one scruple, Quince kernels, white Poppie séedes, of each fiue dragmes, Knotgrasse, Sorrel séedes, yellow Rose seed, broad Plantaine séeds, and Calmus, of each one dragme and seauen graines, one pound or more of Marmalade, dissol∣ued with Sugar or Hony, and the other spices tempered amongst it. Another. Take Marmalade boyled with Hony and white bread well tosted, of each foure ounces, red beaten Saunders one ounce, then put therto a little red Wine, and powne them all togither, whereof the patient may take otherwhiles the waight of halfe an ounce. Spread it also vpon a cloth, and lay it vpon the stomacke. This hath bene oftentimes approued: Take old conserues of Roses, and Marmalade, mixe them both togither vnto a confection made with steeled Goats milke. Item, take confected Quince Peares, or Marmalade, thrée ounces, Masticke, Mints, and Mace, of each one dragme; temper them all togither with a little of the iuice of Quinces, and make Trocisks therof halfe an ounce in waight, and you shall alwayes take one of them before meate. Or take old conserue of Roses thrée ounces, Marmalade two ounces and a half, red Cor∣rall one dragme, Tormentill, Bistorta, Trociscide Carabe, fine Bolus of each halfe a dragme, pre∣pared Bloud stone one quarter of an ounce, temper all togither with the sirupe of Mirtles. Item, take old conserue of Roses three ounces, Marmalade two ounces and a halfe, con∣serue of Buglosse and Burrage, of each one ounce, prepared Bolus one dragme and a half, Cor∣rall and Roses, of each halfe a dragme, prepared Pearles two dragmes and a halfe, Bistorta one dragme, Tormentill two scruples; beate them all small, and make a confection of them with the sirupe of Quinces. It is to be noted, that the old conserue of Roses is very good for all manner of loosenesse of the belly. Some commend that which is made with Sugar alone, and not with Hony. Others vse both kinds, according as the scowring is with heate or with cold. Rob de Cornu∣bus.Conserue of Cornus, called at the Apothecaries Rob de Cornubus, hath great force in binding, for all kinds of loosenesse of the belly, and also for womens excessiue menstrual fluxes, and for all other sorts of bléedings, and it is thus prepared: Take ripe Cornus fruits, boyle them so long in red Wine vntill they may be driuen through a hairen Searse or strainer, and then let that which is strained séeth vntill it be thick by a mild fire, stirring it about continually, vntill it be a thicke conserue, and preserue the same. Mithridate and Treacle do also stay the scowring, like as doth also the conserues of water Lillies, if there be great heate withall. In like manner conserues of Barberies vsed with meate in manner of a sauce. Hereafter follow yet other things moe, which may be taken for this confection: Take Tro∣ciscos de Carabe thrée dragmes, Dragon bloud and fine Bolus, of each half a dragme, Plantaine seedes or Endiue séedes halfe a dragme, Sugar foure ounces: séeth them all togither with Rose water, and make Tabulats of it. This ensuing is taken to be a very good and approued remedie. Take a Nutmeg, burne it at a Waxe candle vntill the oyle drop out, powne it to powder, & temper with it the whites of two Egs, and as much Beane meale as will make a dough. Afterwards make pellets of them as big as a Nut, and put them on a sticke, and rost them softy vntill they be throughly drie, whereof giue to the patient in the morning and also at euening. But if you will haue the scow∣ring
spéedily stopt, then take the more Nutmeg and the lesse meale. In like manner are also highly commended hard sodden egs eaten out of vineger, & strewed with powder of Nutmegs. But some preferre rosted egs alone. Dried Peaches boyled in water and eaten, do stay the red flixe.Peaches pre∣serued. Others do confect Peaches in this manner: Cut the Peaches in two péeces, and take out the stones, tye them to a thréed, and dry them in an Ouen. And when you will vse them, then infuse them in water. Then be they good for the stomacke, stay the scowring, quench thirst, moysten the throate and drought of the tongue. Concerning the drinke and such like, stéeled milke is very good for children. Item, Rose wa∣ter sixe ounces, Cloues, Masticke, Butchers broome seed, of each one dragme: powne them smal, and put it into a glasse, and let it séeth in water, and giue the children a spoonefull of it. Another drinke: Take Glew that is burnt in a baking Ouen foure pound, poune it small, and powre faire fountaine water vnto it; let it séethe a waume or two. Lastly, slake three or fower times in it glowing stéele: afterwards straine it cléere out, and make Almond milke with it. Item, the iuice of Sloes and of Barberies are very commodious, each apart or mingled to∣gither, or drunken with wine, like as is taught in the 15. §. of the scowring Diarrhaea, and of the Sloes. You haue also in the first part and 3. §. another water of Sloes, which may be vsed also for this red or bloodie flixe. Sirupe of Mints is much vsed for all loosenesse of the belly:Sirupe of Mints. therefore it is not amisse to shew at this present, how it is made after two manner of wayes. Take the iuice of ripe Quince peares, the iuice of swéete, méetly swéete, and of sower Pomegranates, of each foure ounces and a halfe, infuse therein foure ounces and a halfe of rumpled Mints the space of foure and twentie houres with halfe an ounce of Roses, afterwards séeth them all together by a mild fire vntill the half be boyled away, & then wring it through a cloth. Further, put good honie vnto it, or Sugar, sixe ounces, and let it séeth well and thicke: lastly, hang in it a péece of silke with Lig∣num Aloes fiue graines, Amber thrée graines, Muske one graine. This sirupe doth not onely stop all scowrings, but is also good for all diseases of the stomach which procéede of cold, and it doth also take away all wambling and vomiting. The other is made thus: Take clarified iuice of Mints, swéete and sower iuice of Pomegra∣nates, let this séethe all togither with sufficient Sugar vnto a sirupe. The sirupe of Quince peares is also of the same efficacie, which is also made diuersly,Sirupe of Quinces. as fol∣loweth hereafter: Take the seedes of broad Plantaine two ounces, Cipers nuts, the middle rinds of an Oken tree, Chestnut tree, and Butchers broome, of each two handfuls, Mirtle seed one handfull, sower Quinces, Seruices and Medlars, of each sixe, the iuice of Sloes halfe an ounce, Hypocistis one ounce: seeth them all togither in Plantaine water, and make thereof a sirupe with sirupe. Another: Take raine water or Rose water sixteene ounces, and seeth therein one ounce of Mirtle seede, Roses, Sumach, the iuice of Sloes, Hypocistis, blossoms of Pomegranats, burnt Iuorie, of each halfe an ounce, ten or twelue vnripe Seruices, Licorice, Dragagant and Gum, of each halfe an ounce: powne all that is to powned, and when it is sodden away vnto twelue ounces, then straine it thorowe a cloth, and put a pound or twaine of Sugar vnto it: then let it seeth againe togither, clarifying it vnto a sirupe. The third sort of sirups is called at the Apothecaries Miua,Miua. which is also made two manner of waies, as followeth: Take of the iuice of Quinces strained well, twelue ounces, seethe it away vnto the halfe, and then powre good wine vnto it, and nine ounces of Sugar, then let it boyle againe vnto a thicke sirupe. This sirupe staieth the laske, and comforteth the stomacke. The other sort of Miua is called Miua Citoniorum aromatica, for that it is prepared with good spice, like as followeth: Take the iuice of sower Quinces seuen common pounds, old wine halfe as much, clarified hony two pound and fower ounces, or one may take Sugar in stead of hony: let them seethe away scumming it, and afterwards hang in this sirupe bounden in a cloth Cinnamome, Cardamome, of each one dragme and a halfe, Cloues one dragme, Ginger, Ma∣stick, of each two scruples, Saffron one dragme, Mace two scruples, Muske halfe a dragme, Gallia Muscatae one dragme: this being all beaten grosse togither, wring it often out, that the force of these may come into the sirupe. This sirupe is much warmer than the other, and there∣fore it is not to be vsed for the loosenesse of the belly which commeth through heate: otherwise
it strengtheneth the stomacke, the lyuer, and all inward members: it causeth appetite to meate, it helpeth digestion, and taketh away the vomiting. Sirupe of Mirtles.The sirupe of Mirtles will we adde vnto it, for that the same is very fit for all scowrings or flixes. Take Mirtle séede twelue ounces, the iuice of Sloes and Butchers broome séede, of each fiftéene graines, Roses one ounce, burnt Iuory and Hypocistis, of each one quarter of an ounce, Mints one dragme: séeth them all togither in raine water vnto the halfe, then straine it tho∣row, and put vnto it sixe ounces of the iuice of Quinces, hony twelue ounces, but clarifie it wel, and let it boyle vnto the consistence of a thick sirupe. Another, which is very common at the Apothecaries. Take Mirtle séede ten dragmes, white Saunders, Butchers broome séedes, blossomes of Pomegranates, of Barberies, of each fiftéene dragmes, Medlars sixe ounces and two dragmes, iuice of Pomegranates, iuice of Crabs, of each twelue ounces: boyle the foresaid simples in these iuices, and with thirtie ounces of Sugar make a sirupe of them. For this is also fit these vsuall Sirupes following, viz. the sirupe of Raspes, Oxysacchara, of dry Roses, and of Peares, for therewith will the sharpnes of the matter be delayed. Clisters are also fit for this disease (whereof some be héere set downe.) First, they are to be made, which the Phisitions do call Lauatiua, which be those that do wash the bowels, for which there is none other to be vsed but Barly water onely. Secondly, if it be desired to haue them clense more, then temper with it some hony of Roses, or a little slight Sugar. The third sort is binding and asswaging the paine: Take a handfull of parched Barly, séethe it well in water, take of this decoction twelue or sixteene ounces, slight Sugar thrée ounces, oyle of Roses two ounces, and two yolks of Egs. This Clister may be often vsed. It is to be noted, that there is to be taken for it oyle of Roses, which is made of Rose buds, for that it is better for this purpose. You haue also a Clister before in the fiftéenth §. which was made of the broth of a Lambs head. For such a one you may vse steeled water, and to séeth therein the séedes of Plantaine. But if so be that then the scrapings of the bowels passe not a∣way withall, there must be tempered amongst it one ounce of Déeres suet, and a dragme of Dragons bloud. For to know whether the vppermost or the vndermost bowels in the red or bloudie flixe be perished, take a handfull of Dogs dung, and dissolue the same in steeled Milke, and giue this to the patient, then, if so be that he presently with paine, with purulencie and bloud auoyd the same againe downeward, and be mixt with the excrements, then it is a sure signe, that the dis∣ease is in the lowermost bowels. But if he goe much to stoole after the paine (the bloud being se∣parated from the excrements) and if the paine be about the Nauell, then it is a signe that the place of this flixe is in the vppermost bowels. If you desire to stay this bloudie flixe, then are these things following to be vsed, to wit, stee∣led water, the iuice of Plantaine, the iuice of the herbe Mullin, and the iuice of Sloes, where∣with one may temper a few paper ashes, and one or two yolks of Egs sodden hard, the powder of sealed earth, or fine Bolus, and the oyle of Mirtles, of which you may chuse that liketh you best, and can get soonest. This Clister ensuing dryeth and healeth, Take vnwormetaen Gals, Butchers broome∣seed, and Bolus, of each one quarter of an ounce, Deeres suet or Goats suet, one ounce and a halfe, two hard sodden yolks of Egs well beaten one ounce, of the iuice of Plantaine and rayne water, as much as is needefull for to seeth the premisses in it. Or take the decoction of butchers broome seede. This Clister is the patient to keepe with him as long as euer he can. Another. Take peeled Lentils, Millet, Roses, blossomes of Pomegranats, and Gals, of each one handfull: seeth these together in a pint and a halfe of water vnto the halfe, take thereof ten ounces, of the oyle of Roses one ounce, paper ashes one dragme, and Deeres suet one ounce, and the yolke of a rosted Egge, and make thereof a Clister. Suppositories. Take white Henbane seede, Opium, white Poppie seede, burnt Iuorie, blos∣somes of Pomegranats, and Frankinsence, of each a like quantitie, boyled Honie one ounce alwayes to a dragme of the premisses, make Suppositories of it. They be strong, they thicken the humor, procure sleepe, and take away the paine: but they be not to be vsed, but when the paine is intollerable. These Pessaries may be made for women to be vsed in the Mother. Take Frankinsence, Linseede, and Saffron, of each one dragme, temper them well together,
and bind it in a fine cloth with a thréed at it, that it may be well pluckt out againe. In great extremities may the stupefactiues be vsed, which do numbe the sinewes, yet are they not to be vsed vnlesse all inward and outward remedies haue bene applied. But first of all are out∣ward medicines, and afterwards inward to be adhibited. Likewise the remedies which be mi∣nistred by the mouth, are first to be tried, and afterwards from below. For this are these Pils ensuing also vsed. Take the blossomes and pils of Pomegranates,Pils for all manner of fluxes of bloud. Mirtle séed, Comfrey rootes, Dragon bloud, fine Bolus, the iuice of Sloes, Roses, Argall, Hy∣pocistis, Butchers broome séed, and Saffron, Gallia muscata, Gals, Cinnamome, burnt Iuorie, Mace, and Gum, of each one dragme, Opium one dragme and a halfe: make of them with the iuice of Plantaine, as small Pils as hempe seeds, and giue thereof nine or eleuen at one time. Item, there was a woman that voided eightéene pound of bloud at thrée times, and she was cured with Philonium Persicum, which was tempered with the iuice of Plantaine and parched Rubarbe. But in these weightie matters an expert Phisition is to be sent for, because (as we haue told alreadie) there is no iesting with this Philonium. What ought to be outwardly vsed for this disease. FIrst of all it is good to binde the armes, but not the legges; then is also a bath to be made, wherin be decocted the leaues of Quinces, Peares, Medlars, Seruice tree, Cornus leaues, Butchers broome, Gals, Mirtles, Acorne cups, Roses, and such like binding things, wher∣in the sicke persons are to be set euen vp to their nauels. Thus may you also séeth the foresaid things, and wet clothes in the decoction, & thē lay them warm vpon the belly: or in the stead of them, to vse the iuice of Plantaine, or any other iuices of binding herbes, as Butchers broome séed, or Mirtle séed: and temper also the powder amongst it, whereof be made Trocisci de Terra sigillata. These sicke persons do complaine also of great paine, when the sharpe humour scoureth through the excoriated bowels. Now for to asswage the same, you are to take of the first men∣tioned things, which you will: but you must put alwayes Cammomill and Melilot vnto it, and afterwards let them seeth in wine or stéeled water, and then lay them with a cloth wroong out, or with a sponge vpon the paine. You may make also three or foure bagges of the foresaid things, and séeth them in wine, and so lay thē warme vpon the paine, and when the one is cold, then to lay another vpon it againe. There be also fumigations vsed for this sicknesse, for which is to be taken Cypers nuts, Mirtle seed. Butchers broome séed, Pomegranate pils, and wormeaten Gals, of each one hand∣full, the iuice of Sloes, prepared Coriander, Hypocistis, Plantaine seed, Roses, Frankinsence, Sandaraca, Gallia muscata, Bloudstone, and Marierome, of each one handfull, Cinnamome, Ma∣sticke, and parched Caruway séed, of each one dragme, Colophonia one ounce and a halfe; make a powder of them, and strew thereof vpon the coales, and receiue the fume from below. Another. Take Marierome, seedes of Butchers broome, Mirtle and Coriander, of each one handfull and a halfe, blossomes and pils of Pomegranates Hypocistis, and yellow Rose seeds, of each halfe a handfull, rootes of the herbe Mullin, rootes of Carduus benedictus, the rinds and roots of the Mulbery tree: make all these to powder, and then make also a bagge for to sit vpon, and take therewith the first aboue mentioned things, and boile them in wine. For a plaister: Take a shiue or twaine of Rye bread, tost it well, and besprinkle it with Vi∣neger or red wine; afterwards beate it, and put vnto it Gals, Acorne cups, the blossomes and shales of Pomegranats, and the rinds of the Medlar tree, of each two ounces, Roses, Starch, the iuice of Sloes, fine Bolus, sealed earth and Dragon blood, of each one ounce; make them all to powder, and put it then amongst the foresaid bread. Further, make a plaister with a suffi∣cient quantitie of the oyle of Mirtles, Roses, and Rose water, with as much vineger as suffi∣ceth, and so lay this plaister warme vpon the stomacke. This patient may also vse such salues for this disease, as do hereafter follow. Take oyle of Roses, of Mirtles, oile of Quinces, and of Masticke, of each halfe an ounce, Gals, Roses, blos∣somes of Pomegranates, Mirtle seed, fine Bolus, Dragon blood and Mastick, of each one scrup. Waxe as much as is needfull for to make a salue. This following is stronger: Take Masticke sixe ounces, oile of Quinces and of Mirtles, of each three ounces, Masticke, the iuice of Sloes,
and Dragons bloud, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, red Corall, Amber, sealed earth, of each halfe an ounce, the innermost pils of Chestnuts, prepared Iron drosse, of each one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus, Pomegranate pils and Frankinsence, of each one quarter of an ounce, Resin halfe an ounce, Waxe as much as sufficeth for to make an oyntment thereof, wherewith the belly must be annointed 3. or 4. times a day. This vnguent is speciall good against excessiue flowing of the flowers in women, the same being laid vpon the Hips and vpon the thighes. Item, take Rosin thrée ounces, the séeds of Butchers broome, prepared Coriander, and Mir∣tle seede, of each halfe a dragme, Masticke two scruples, Hypocistis, red Saunders, of each halfe a dragme, oyle of Mirtles and of Quinces, of each one ounce and a halfe; melt the Rosin in Vi∣neger, and make a Plaister of it, or a salue, and annoint therewith the whole Belly, and a∣bout the Ribs. Boxing cups are also very méete for this purpose set on vnpickt vpon the Nauell, vpon ey∣ther side of the Nauell one: this will draw backe the bloud. Let them also remaine thereon the space of foure howers. Some also do aduise for to open the Median; other the Liuer veine, therby to delay the sharp∣nesse of the humor, and to withdraw it, and also to coole the Liuer with it: but it is somwhat dangerous, and ought not to be effected at any hand, except it were for some great cause, and therefore is here the counsell of a learned Phisition to be required. For a lotion of the féet you are to take of the forementioned things, and therwith to rub the shins and the legs. In fine, what simples soeuer are to be vsed for this red or bloudie Flixe through heate or cold are these; to wit, in heate, take the blossomes of Pomegranates, Gals, Butchers broomséedes, the iuice of Sloes, Roses, Barberies, Quince kernels and the rinds, Pomegranate pils, sea∣led earth, Bolus, burnt Iuorie, Hypocistis, Pomegranate kernels, Sorrell séede, Plantain seed, Raisins stones, and all binding fruites; as vnripe Melons, vnripe Mulberries, vnripe Sloes, Medlars, Seruices, the fruite of Cornus, and such like. Of compounded things be Trisanta∣lon, Diacodion, old conserue of Roses, and many other mo which are before mentioned. Sim∣ples which bind and warm, are Nutmegs, Cypers nuts and the leaues, Frankinsence, Myrrhe, Laudanum, red Styrax. Amber, Ameos, Cinnamom, parched Annis, and such like. The com∣pounded be Diamentha, Diacinnamomum, and all that are of the like nature. The other kind of Dysenteria or bloudy Flixe. §. 18. IT hath bene shewed before, that the learned haue described yet another maner of bloudie flixe, the which by the vnskilful is wrongly called by the name of Dy∣senteria, for it cometh without any scrapings of the guts, and with much more bloud then the former. Wherefore it is rather to be taken for a flixe of the Liuer than for ought else. This flixe is also threefold: first, idle persons that are full of bloud, and that eate and drinke much; also they that omit their wonted exercises, are very subiect to this infirmitie, for these of necessitie must haue ouermuch bloud, which nature séeketh to expell as she doth all such things that in any way are trouble∣some vnto her, but especially in the Liuer, albeit that some other inward parts might cause the same. The signs of this flixe are first cleare bloud, which with a great quantitie doth suddenly passe away at one time, and returneth againe afterwards. It may also be well caused of sharpe me∣dicines, which may be vnderstood and knowne of the patient. Secondly, it may also happen through weakenesse of the retentiue vertue: for if there be no perfect digestion, then séemeth the bloud like vnto water wherein flesh had bene washed, and so is auoyded with the ordure by stoole. In like manner it may be caused also very well through melancholy, and in the scouring is the bloud blacker. But if it come through the inward piles, then is the bloud cleare, yet somewhat blackish. Sometime it is caused through some veine, which chanceth to breake within the body: And then doth this scouring come very suddenly, little or much, according to that the veine so broken is great or small. The difference betwéene all these fluxes of bloud is, that the Hepaticall fluxe is without paine, where to the contrarie, all other are not without paine and anguish of the place, from whence the bloud issueth.
Thus for to cure this bloudie flixe, plethoricke persons who be infected with this scouring, must betake themselues to all manner of sobrietie in eating and drinking: open a veine, vse some exercise, and purge, if néed require. But if so be that the same be caused through any sharp medicine receiued, then is this scouring to be stayed by taking thrée dragmes of Cresses séede with stéeled milke, or through any other binding medicine before mentioned. This plaister following is to be applyed on the Liuer: Take Roses, red Saunders, of each halfe an ounce, Spike one dragme, Barly meale two ounces, Wine and Vineger, as much as will suffise for to make a plaister, lay this warme vpon it. If this scouring procéede through heate, then giue him Trisantalon: Or if it come through cold, then giue him some warming Con∣fection, and other things mo which be rehearsed before. Secondly, if there run any black bloud amongst it, then open the Median. It is also good for this, that the bodie be well rubbed mor∣ning and euening about the place where the disease is, so that those things whereby these parts are nourished, might be drawne thither. But if so be that there be any veine broken, then looke what is written of the casting vp of the bloud, which is caused through a broken veine, in the second part, the fifth Chapter, and 18. §. Of all bloudie Flixes in generall. §. 19. FOr a conclusion of all these bloudie Fluxes, there is to be added vnto them, to wit, if so be that through any excessiue scouring, (of whatsoeuer occasion it be) the patient fall into a swound (like as it often hapneth) what is then to be done in it. First of all, he is to be cherished with water, and moe other meanes are to be vsed for it, as in the second part, the sixt Chapter, 2. §. hath bene said of swowning. Further, the patient is to be nourished with good meate, and Wine, to wit, with rosted Pul∣lets, Turtle doues, and other Doues, Cloues, Rose water, Galingall, and Lignum Aloes, which be very méete for him. When as then the swouning is past, then are all meanes to be sought for to stay his scouring, and to bring the patient to rest and sléepe. There is also to be giuen vnto him one dragme of Treacle, or Philonium, and if so be that he can abide it, then let him bathe, euen as is here before admonished. Item, we will moreouer adde hereunto a generall rule, how a man is to gouerne himselfe in these bloudie fluxes. First, he must beware of all moist meates, because that thereby the moi∣sture of the bodie is augmented; but there is much rather to be vsed all that is drie, like as hard baked Egs, and such like, without much salt, and much fat. Also all things are to be drest with stéeled Water, Oaten pap, Barly pap, and Pullets broths are not forbidden, neither yet shiues of bread baked in fat or butter. He shall also eate white bread: red Wine is better for this sick∣nes then white: but if you can get no red Wine, then take old white Wine which is not so sowre, and temper the same with steeled water, temper therewith some parched Gum, Bolus, and burnt Iuorie. In like manner also temper some iuice of Barberies in his drinke, or in stead thereof, vse wine of Barberies. Almond milke made with steeled water may he also drinke, but not to drinke much is best for all loosenesse of the belly. And whereas in this sicknesse the patient commonly looseth his appetite, yet are there some Phisitions who permit the patient to eate what he most longeth for, albeit they do counsel most of all for bread and other meates, which be most necessarie for this sicknes. Betweene meales be conserue of Roses and Marmalade very commodious to be eaten. For in this sicknesse is the patient to be kept quiet, warme, and well couered, and rather to let his ordure and excrements in a boll vnder him, then to rise often, for the lesse that he is stir∣red, the sooner will the scouring be stayed. All that is too hote and looseth much, is forbidden in this infirmitie, whether it be Spice, or any herbes: likewise also very strong Hony, Milke, Fruite, Cheese, Fish, and all doughie meates.
Of the Constipation or binding in the body. §. 20. WE haue hitherto discouered many kindes of things, which do stay the fluxe or laske. But it is well knowen to all men, that the health of man is oftentimes neglected, through constipation of the body, and when the excrements haue not their naturall course: therefore it is the principall determination of all famous Phisitions, to kéepe open the body for all manner of sicknesses, whereby the su∣perfluous matter and bad humors may be auoyded, euen as euery where may be séene throughout this whole booke. And albeit this binding of the bodie procéede of diuers causes; yet it is not néedfull to dispute further thereof, because that in certaine sicknesses which be caused through this constipation, is sufficiently spoken of it. We will here therefore speake of the binding of the body in healthy persons. For this is first néedfull a common and necessary rule, to wit; all that is taken to loose the body, it be done fasting, that is, whē the stomacke is emptied of other meates, and that one fast an hower or twaine after it: for if so be that the meate be mixed with the medicine, then can it not performe his operation as it behooueth; for it will thereby be hindered and enféebled. Se∣condly, to begin alwayes with the weakest and easiest things: and if they worke not strongly enough, then are after that more forcible things to be vsed. And because no safer things can be vsed, than Suppositories and Clisters, therefore we will first of all begin to speake of them. Suppositories to prouoke Stooles. THere be made many kinds of Suppositories, whereof these are the easiest: Take Honie as much as you please, séethe it hard, and to prooue if it be sodden enough, let a drop fall vpon a cold stone, or vpon an Iron, which being cold, will spring in péeces if you strike vpon it; if that it do not cleaue, then it is sodden enough. Afterwards temper amongst it salt and meale, and powre it on a stone table, or on a Tin trencher, and roll vp the Suppository as thicke as you will haue it: then cut it off and make both the ends sharp and euen by the fire or candle, and afterwards reserue it in Sallad oyle, or in Lyne oyle. These Suppositories are to be put into the fundament, and to be kept therein as long as is possible. In like maner doth also this ensuing: Take two parts of meale and one part of salt; make a Suppository thereof with the white of an eg, and kéepe it drie. Other some vse in stéede of this Suppository, that which followeth hereafter: They beate the white of an eg, and stir a good deale of salt amongst it, and a little Soote: they put the same in a fine cloth the quantity of a Nutmeg, and binde it fast, and let a thréed hang at it; being an∣nointed with fat or oile, put the same into the fundament, and when you will go to the stoole, then plucke it out againe. Stronger Suppositories, which are to be vsed at the Apothecaries, are these: Take Species Hierae simplicis one dragme, Salt halfe a scruple, Honie one ounce; seethe these all togither hard, and make Suppositories of them. These may be vsed with all safety. But if you will haue them yet stronger, then put halfe a dragme of Sal gemmae vnto it. Species Hierae.The foresaid Species Hierae be thus made: Take Cinnamom, Mastick, Asarabacca, Balsam fruit, Saffron, Balsam wood, & Cassie wood, of each one drag. Aloe two ounces; make a powder of them. There be also Suppositories to be made (if there can nothing els be gottē) of salt Larde cut in long slices; of Allom cut also of the longest fashion, & of Venice sope &c. For yong children are also Suppositories made of fresh Butter, Figs, and Béete rootes, and such like. Also there be made for especiall sicknesses many kinde of Suppositories, which be not here specified. The Clisters be maruellous requisite to open the Constipation of the body, and of more ef∣fect than the Suppositories: because that through their moysture & slipperynes, they enter fur∣ther into the bowels, and do there supple, soften, and prouoke the going to stoole. Of these Cli∣sters we haue euery where described diuers in this our booke: yet we will recite here certaine moe, which do open the body without any paine. Take Mallowes thrée handfuls, Béetes, Mercurie, of each two handfuls; séethe them togither and wring them out: then take of this de∣coction twelue or sixtéene ounces, thrée yolkes of egs, oyle of Sesamum, or of Lineséede fower
ounces, Sal gemmae halfe a dragme, temper them together, and minister it warme. Item, take Mutton broth, Veale broth, or Hen broth, as much as before, melt therein fresh Butter, and Ducks grease, of each one ounce, Saffron halfe a dragme, oyle of Dill and of Lil∣lies, of each one ounce and a halfe, Indie salt one dragme, and then temper them together, this is somewhat stronger. There may also be taken in stead of the foresaid oyle S. Tho. Sugar, and oyle of Violets, of each two ounces: but if so be that the paine be great, then may be tempered with it one dragme of Philonium, and one ounce of the oyle of Mandragora. In fine, all common Clisters be fit for this which be made of fresh broth, Sallad oyle, oyle of Violets, boyled Mallowes, Béetes, Pel∣litory of the wall, Cammomill, Melilot, and such like suppling things. Some do vse also these things following in the stead of suppositories: Take new Milke and Butter, of each two spoonefuls, make it warme, and vse it as a Clister. There be also many easy Conserues and Confections which do also loose the body, like as conserue of Pellitorie, which by long continuance doth loose if one take it alone. First, you haue before in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, in the second §. a conserue of Currans, and others which be very requisite. How commodious also the Cassia is, hath in many sundry places been séene: yet hereafter ensueth a very notable and safe confection of Cassie and Manna for to kéepe the bodie open. Take Damaske Prunes one ounce, Violets one dragme and a halfe, faire well water nine ounces, séethe them together vnto the halfe, and temper in this decoction Cassie two ounces, sowre Dates halfe an ounce, Manna one ounce, sirupe of Violets two ounces, Sugar candie, and Sugar pennets, of each halfe an ounce: bruse the sowre Dates in the decoction, and then boyle them thicke with other confections, powre then the dissolued Manna vnto it, that through séething it lose not the force. This confection is requisite for all daintie persons which be bounden in the bodie, for it hath no vnpleasant taste, it doth loose very gently, expelleth Cho∣leram, and asswageth an Ague. Also for a gentle laxation one may eate Cassie out of the pipe one ounce, casting away the stones. For the same purpose are these Confections following also fit: Take a quart of good Rhenish wine, stéepe therein the space of sixe howres halfe an ounce of Sene husks, and one ounce and a halfe of Sene leaues, let them boyle well: temper afterwards in this wine Currans pouned small one pound, fat Figs three ounces, rub these thorough a Strainer, which being done, put foure ounces of Sugar candie vnto it, and then let it boyle vntill it be méetly thick. Lastly, you are to mixe with it halfe an ounce of Cinnamome, whereof you are to vse halfe an ounce at a time. These laxatiue confections following are commonly ordayned in Minerall bathes: Take ryndes of yellow Mirobalanes, & of Indie, of each one ounce, bruse them well with Currans, Sene husks two ounces, Polipody rootes one ounce and a halfe; let this seethe together vnto the halfe in the water of Betonie, Sage and Buglosse, of each sixe ounces, water of Mints thrée ounces, temper amongst them Agaricus one dragme and a halfe, Rubarb one quarter of an ounce, Ginger one scruple, Thyme and wilde Thyme, of each halfe a handfull. When it hath sodden méetly well, then let it stand a night, and in the morning wring it out, then mixe foure ounces of Cassie amongst it, the iuice of Currans (which is Looch de Passulis) two ounces, beaten Cinnamome one ounce, Spec. laetitiae Galeni one quarter of an ounce, Sugar sixe ounces, séethe them with Betonie water vnto a sirupe, and make a confection of it. Sowre Dates be also a blessed medicine, for they purge very mildly, and therefore they be seldome vsed alone, but what force and vertue they haue, is sufficiently shewed in the first part of this booke. The laxatiue confection of Prunes (called Diaprunis lenitiua) is very pleasant and méete:Diaprunis lenitiua. it doth not only loose the belly, but delayeth Choleram, it quencheth thirst, and is good for all heate, but especially when the Ague is in his prime, and it is thus prepared: Take fiftie Prunes (the stones pluckt out) seeth them in sufficient water, then bruse them thorough a Strainer, that the skinnes may tarie out: afterwards put the broth or liquor into the same pot where they were sodden on the fire againe, and put vnto it thrée quarters of an ounce of dryed Violets, and let it séethe vp twice or thrice, then strayne out the decoction, and put it vnto the foresayd brused Prunes. This being done, put sixe ounces of Sugar vnto it, and let it séethe againe vntill it be
thickish, and then take some of the liquor remaining, and therewith temper Cassie and sowre Dates, of each one quarter of an ounce: lastly, mixe all together, and let it boyle softly vntill it be as thicke as a confection. Item, take powned Rubarbe halfe an ounce, fresh conserue of Roses two ounces, temper, and vse thereof about one quarter of an ounce at a time. There is scant any confection which is not onely more méete for this matter, but in many other causes moe, then that which is called at the Apothecaries Electuarium de Sebesten, and is therefore worthie to be rehearsed. Electuarium de Sebesten.Take Sebesten and Prunes (hauing both of them their stones taken out) of each two ounces and a halfe, Violet water sixe ounces, water of blew flowers deluce, and Pompeon water, of each thrée ounces, Mercury water two ounces, Sugar pennets foure ounces, Rob de Prunis six ounces, péeled Melon seede, Pompeon séede, Gourd séede, and péeled Cucumber seede, of each one ounce, Diagridion one dragme and a halfe beaten small, boyle these fruites in the waters, then driue them thorow a strainer, and boyle them with the Sugar, and when it is almost cold, then adde the séedes cut very small, and the Diagridion beaten finely. This confection is very good for all hote Agues: for it easeth thirst, watching and bitternesse of the mouth, and doth cause much vrine to be auoided. Diaturbith cū Rhabarbaro.There be also many kinds of Spices prepared, wherof Confections & other things be made, of which we wil here describe some: to wit, Diaturbith cum Rhabarbaro which is thus prepared: Take Turbith and Hermodactyli, of each one ounce, Rubarbe one quarter of an ounce, Diagridij halfe an ounce, white and red Saunders, Violets and Ginger, of each one dragme and a halfe, Annis, Masticke, Cinnamom and Saffron, of each one dragme and a halfe, Sugar foure∣teene ounces and a quarter of an ounce: make of all these premisses a powder or Confe∣ction. Another: Take Rubarbe halfe an ounce, Cloues and Galingall, of each one quarter of an ounce, Hermodactyli and white Sugar of each thrée dragm. Diagridii sixe ounces, Sene leaues one quarter of an ounce, Indy Spica, Saffron, Ginger, Annis and Masticke, of each one scrup. lastly, make a powder of it. Both these are fit for to purge all bad humors, be they Cholera, Phle∣gma, or Melancholia. Tabulats of Ginger laxa∣tiue.The purging Tabulats of Ginger be made thus: Take beaten Ginger one quarter of an ounce, Cinnamom and Cloues, of each one dragme, Nutmegs and Galingall, of each one scru∣ple, Saffron fourtéene ounces, Turbith halfe a dragme, Diagridion one dragme, Sugar two ounces; make Tabulats of it: exhibite not aboue one quarter of an ounce at once, for they be meetly strong. The like purging Confections you may find very many at well furnished Apo∣thecaries; to wit, Diaphoenicon, de succo Rosarum &c. Take Epithymum, Polipodie rootes, and Thyme, of each one dragme, Sene leaues thrée quarters of an ounce, Argall thrée dragmes, Cinnamom and Annis, of each one dragme, the powder of Dill leaues one quarter of an ounce, make them into powder: take a dragme of it, tempered with fresh broth. The powder Pasaphan.In Italy they haue a powder called Pasaphan, which is there much in vse; and is thus pre∣pared: Take Sene leaues thrée dragmes, Turbith one quarter of an ounce, good Rubarbe one dragme, Licorice, Annis, Fennell, of each halfe a dragme, Indy Spica fiue graines: these being all powdred, and then giuen one dragme at the most with wine or with any kind of water. This powder is very common at some Apothecaries, and is thus prepared: Take Turbith halfe an ounce, Cinnamom and Ginger, of each one quarter of an ounce, Galingall, Masticke, Cardamome, Cloues, of each halfe a dragme, Annis one dragm. Hermodactyli, Diagridion, Sene leaues, of each halfe an ounce, Sugar three ounces; temper these together, and giue him a drag. of it at the most. Medicamen de Turbith.Medicamen de Turbith is also common, whereof here do follow two sorts: Take white Gin∣ger, Masticke and Turbith, of each halfe an ounce, Sugar one ounce and a halfe; mixe these to a subtill powder. The other: Take Turbith halfe an ounce, Ginger one quarter of an ounce, Masticke tenne graines, Sugar three dragmes: this being beaten small and tempered well together, purgeth slimie humors: of the which may well be giuen to yong children, women in child bed, old folks and all dainty persons, one dragme at the least at one time. Of which may all be giuen accor∣ding to the abilitie of the person, more or lesse.
Sene powder called Puluis Senae praeparatae, is not onely laxatiue,Puluis Senae praeparatae. but also purgeth maruellous well the head. Take Sene leaues one ounce and a halfe, Ginger and Nutmegs of each two dragmes, Cin∣namom and Argall, of each one dragme and a halfe: make a powder of it, and giue one dragme of it at once. A powder: Take Turbith one quarter of an ounce, Ginger Cinnamom, Mastick, Galingal, Cardamome, Cloues, Annis, Hermodactyli, and Diagridij, of each one dragm, Sene leaues halfe an ounce, Sugar one ounce; or put vnto them as much Sugar as you thinke good, for without Sugar it is not to be taken aboue one dragme. Item take Sene leaues halfe an ounce, Ginger, and Cinnamom, of each one dragme, Sugar one quarter of an ounce: take the halfe thereof, and strewe it vpon a slice or shiue of tosted bread, that hath bene stéeped in wine, and so eate it. But if it do not loose, then eate another slice of bread and the rest in a morning. It is surely good. Amongst the things that one doth eate, some mixe Mercurie leaues in a Sallad, for they do easily loose them that be apt to go to stoole. Item, Dates, Mirobalanes, stued Prunes strewed well with Sugar, do loose the body very mildly. Likewise also Damaske Prunes stewed with Raisins, do loose also if one sup vp the broth withall, fiue or sixe Figs eaten before meate, do open the bodie. Item, Currans washt in swéet Wine, and stéeped therein, and afterwards dried and strewed with Sugar, are also very good for this purpose. Or take Raisins (as is said) which be steeped, half a pound, beate them, and wring them thorough a hairen strainer, Sugar two ounces, Sugar of Roses, and Hony of Roses, of each one ounce and a halfe, seeth them well by a mild fire vnto a confection, then take of it as often as you will the quantitie of a nut. Also you may steepe these Currans in oyle of swéet Almonds strewed with Sugar and then eaten, for much Sugar hath a laxatiue nature, and especially in young children. Now will we write of certaine laxatiue potions, of which be diuers readie at all well furni∣shed Apothecaries to be had, and albeit you may vse the same alone, yet notwithstanding haue all Phisitions ordained, that the same shall be commonly tempered and taken with purging medicines, whereof here shall follow some, which the Apothecaries at Augusta haue at all times in a readinesse. First they haue a drinke which they call Decoctionem communem,Decoctio com∣munis. which is a common deco∣cted potion, made after this manner: Take ten or twelue Prunes, Licorice, Currans, Annis séede, and Fennell, of each half an ounce, floures of Burrage and Buglosse, of each one dragm and a halfe, powre a quart of water vnto it, séeth it so long vntill a third part be wasted, then straine it thorough. This drinke ensuing is of a temperate nature, for it is somewhat more cooling, and the same is to be vsed in Sommer. Take Currans, Licorice, Prunes, Iuiubes, Violets, Barley, péeled Melon séede, Pompeon séede, Gourd séede, and Cucumber seede, of each one quarter of an ounce, boyle them together in water like as is said before. Take Fumitorie, Betonie, Mints, Mugwort, of each halfe a handfull, floures of Burrage and Buglosse, of each halfe a dragme, Annis, Fennell, Asarabacca, of each halfe an ounce, wild Saffron seede thrée quarters of an ounce, Calmus one ounce, Polipody rootes, Agaricus, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sene leaues one ounce, the seeds and rootes must be beaten grosse, (let∣ting them séeth first a little) afterwards put vnto it the herbs, floures, and Agaricke, and so let them seeth again: when it is then cold, wring it out hard, & kéepe it well very close stopt in a coole place. In like manner there is prepared a stronger which is called Decoctio aperitiua maior,Decoctio ape∣ritiua maior. and is made thus: Take Endiue, Cicorie, Fumitorie, of each one handful, Agrimonie, Windweed, and Harts toong, of each half a handfull, floures of Burrage and Buglosse, of each one quarter of an ounce, Thime and wild Thime, of each two dragmes and a halfe, rootes of Fennell, Smallage, Parsly of each halfe an ounce, Annis & Fennell séede, Melon séed, of each one quar∣ter of an ounce, sliced Licorice halfe an ounce, rootes of Cipers, rinds of Tamariske, of each thrée dragmes, Sene leaues two ounces, Polipodie rootes one ounce, Agaricus halfe an ounce, seethe them all together in water like as is said before, then wring it well out. You are to steepe in this decoction Rubarb thrée dragm. and a halfe. Indy Spica one scruple, Sal Gemmae halfe a scruple, Cinnamome two scruples, let them stand together to stéepe all a whole night, afterwards séeth
it once in boyling water, straine it very well out, and put sixe ounces of Sugar vnto it. Decocto Senae.A decoction of Sene leaues called Decoctio Senae: Take Sene leaues two ounces, and Sene husks one ounce, rootes of Cicorie, Agrimonie, Hyssope, of each half a handfull, Polipody roots one ounce, séeth them together in a quart of water vntill the third part be decocted away, then wring it out, and kéepe it in a coole place. I susio Senae.Another, Insusio Senae: This decoction is much vsed for the Pockes at Augusta in Germany, for which it is most méete: Take the huskes and leaues of Sene, of each fiue dragmes, Ginger two scruples, Burrage flowers, Violets, Roses, of each one scruple, Polipodie one quarter of an ounce, Currans halfe an ounce, ten or twelue Sebesten, sliced Agaricus halfe an ounce, powre vpon them sixtéene ounces of boyling water, and let it be stéeped the space of ten houres by the warme ashes, afterwards wring it out and kéepe it well, whereof is commonly thrée or fowre ounces taken, and sirupe of Fumitorie, or De Bizantijs one ounce and a halfe, or two ounces tempered together, three or fowre dayes one after another. There be also vsed many other laxatiue potions, like as this Wine following: Take Sene leaues two ounces, Tymus and Epithymus, of each one ounce and a half, flowers of Burrage and Buglosse, of each thrée handfuls, Harts tong, and rootes of Cicorie, of each two handfuls, Rose∣mary Stechas, of each one handful, Roses and Balme, of each thrée handfuls: these are to be put drie and flixed into a litle Runlet, and powre fiftie quarts of Must vpon it, and then let it stand and clarifie, when as néede doth require, then may you take a good draught of it before meate. Item, drinke Pullet broth wherein Prunes are decocted, and to eate the Prunes is very commodious. But this broth relaxeth better when it is boiled with Currans and much Sugar. In like manner new Whay well salted and drunken warm doth loose, but better if it be sodden with Prunes. In like manner also are you to take Wormewood, Hony, and Sugar according to the abili∣tie of the person, séeth this together in water, and drinke a good draught thereof. Item, take Sanicle with the rootes, séeth it well, and drinke of it the quantitie of foure ounces, tempered with Hony of Roses. If so be that pilles can not be vsed, then take foure ounces of water wherein Mallowes were before decocted, and dissolue Sugar therein or Hony of Violets, and so drinke it. Or take Linséede, Hops, & Burrage, al together, or each apart, decoct them to a potion, this looseth also. The same doth also one ounce of Polipodie, and halfe an ounce of Fennell séedes decocted toge∣ther. Item, take conserue of Eldern one ounce, or one ounce and a half, dissolue it in fresh broth one pound, and drinke fasting a good draught thereof. Fumitorie and Goats milke boyled to∣gether doth not onely loose the belly, but also cleanseth the bloud. The decoction of Charuill and of Larkes spurres do also open the bodie. Item, the decoction of Coleworts, of Béetes, and of Lentils, in euery of these are you to temper the quantitie of an hasell nut of fine Turpentine, and to drinke it warme, which is also good for the excoriation of the guts. The decoction of Creuises, and of all other fishes, are also very good for relaxation, but swéet oyle of Almonds is most commodious for this purpose, more sure and most pleasant being ta∣ken with Sugar. It asswageth all griping of the belly, and of the breast: which oyle is thus to be made. Oyle of Al∣monds.Take Almonds as many as you please, make them clean, beate them small, rost them a litle on hote ashes, or on a small fire, stirring them alwaies about; put them afterwards very hote into a strong bag, which is made wet in Rosewater, and presse it out forcibly, then haue you a fine and cleare oyle, whereof may be vsed for aged folkes foure or sixe ounces tempered with course Sugar, for children, and also for the first borne, each according to his age. Thicke or puddle Wine, doth not onely bind the bodie but doth oppilate also the Liuer, the Milt, and the Kidneys, this do they which drinke much of it, therefore it is to be refrained. Of all laxatiue medicines and potions, Manna is not the basest, but is highly commended aboue all other things, for it is one of the blessedst medicins, like as is mentioned more at large in the Introduction. This Manna is ministred diuersly, according to the abilitie of the person, like as water of Burrage, fresh broth, and such like. You may also giue of this Manna to yong children,The vse of Cassie. to each one according to his age, be it in their Drinke, Milke, or Pap. In like manner is Cassie also a very notable and laxatiue medicine, euen as is shewed here∣before
at large in the introduction: for it is much more commodious to be taken after the forme of a conserue, than in any kinde of potion, by reason that there must be put vnto it so much moy∣sture, thus will we heere prescribe for an example how the same is to be vsed: Take the rootes of Polipody chopt small one ounce, seeth them in the water of Burrage eight ounces, and dis∣solue therwith one ounce and a half or two ounces of Cassie, letting all that is black be washed cleane off, and then drinke this warme, it looseth very gently. Héere before in the first part, in the first Chapter and 3. §. you haue a good mead of Sene leaues for children and other persons very necessary to be vsed, yet, this following may be pre∣pared: Take Sene leaues half an ounce, Ginger and Annis, of each one quarter of an ounce, beaten Licorice thrée dragmes, séethe them all together in sixteene ounces of water euen to the halfe, drinke the one halfe in the morning and the other halfe in the euening. Also there be certaine Sirupes vsed for the loosing of the bodie, whereof the chiefest is, the laxatiue sirupe of Roses, which is before described in the first part. Also there is made a sirupe of Sene leaues, as hereafter followeth. Take right Endiue,Sirup of Sene leaues. Cicorie, Agrimony, of each halfe a handfull, Venus haire, Harts toong, of each halfe so much, seedes of Melons, Pompeons, Cucumbers, & Gourds, of each one dragme, wild Saffron séede, Polipody rootes, seeds of Endiue, Cicorie, and Licorice, of each two scruples, Barly one ounce, winter Cherries, Windweed, of each one quarter of an ounce, Fearne rootes, Smallage, Fen∣nell, and Sperage, of each halfe an ounce, Currans three dragmes, sixe or seauen Prunes, floures of Burrage, Buglosse, and Violets, of each halfe a dragme, seeth them all together in a quarte of water almost vnto the halfe, wring it well out, and then lay to steepe in this de∣coction one ounce of Sene leaues, prepared Agaricus half an ounce, Rubarb three quarters of an ounce. When it hath stoode so one night, and is wroong out, then temper with it, Syrupum Capillorum Veneris, which is the sirupe of Venus haire, the sirupe of Violets, of each one ounce, white Sugar thrée ounces, let this séethe by a soft fire vnto a sirupe: lastly, put more vnto it halfe a dragme of beaten Cinnamome, and one scruple of yellow Saunders, and so kéepe this sirupe vntill that you will vse it. Of this sirupe you may boldly giue one ounce, or an ounce and a halfe, or more, vnto all deli∣cate persons, yea to women also with child, and that with fresh broth, or any distilled water, for it is very safe. Another Syrupe. Take Endiue, Liuerwort, Venus haire, all greene, of each one handfull, red and white Saunders, of each one quarter of an ounce, Melon séede, Gourd séede, Cucumber séede, Pompeon seede, and Burrage, of each halfe an ounce, Sene, Epithymum, of each one ounce, Rubarb three quarters of an ounce, Turbith halfe an ounce, Indie Spica halfe a dragme, Gin∣ger one dragme, Sugar twelue ounces, dissolued in Endiue water, make a sirupe of it like as is taught in the first part, the first Chapter, and 6. §. Hony of Roses looseth also very well, especially that which is made of the iuice of Roses, euen as it is described in the first part, the fourteenth Chapter, and 4. §. For this are also sundry pils prepared, and that after this manner following: Take Bdellium and Aloe, which haue beene steeped the space of three dayes in Sheepes milke, of each one quarter of an ounce, temper them, and forme pils of them, vse thereof one scruple, or halfe a dragme at once, they will do you much pleasure. Item, take before supper one dragme of washt Aloe. This salue following is also laxatiue, if that the belly and the nauell be annoynted with it: Take the salue Agrippa, and the confection of Hiera, of each halfe an ounce, the iuice of Swines bred and Scammonie, of each three graynes, Euphorbium, Turbith, Coloquinte, of each one scruple, beate them all together. Item, take Pitch and Frankinsence, of each a like quantitie, cast them on hote coles vnder a close stoole, and sit ouer it with the bare buttocks, it looseth. For a conclusion, there is to be found through this whole booke, how that the bodie is to be loosed and opened for all manner of sicknesses; but this is onely spoken of all them who be in health, and cannot go to stoole.
Of the strayning or vnsatiable desire of going to stoole, which is called Tenasmus. §. 21. FOr as much as through both the foresaid maladies, as well of the excessiue go∣ing to the stoole, as through binding in the bodie, this strayning which the Grecians do call Tenasmus and Tenesmus, may be prouoked: therefore we can not omit, but adde the same vnto the rest, and is thus described. Tenasmus is a disease or maladie in the end of the Arsegut hard by the fun∣dament, with great paine, and continuall desire to goe to the stoole, where not∣withstanding the patient can be discharged and rid of very little or nothing at all. We do call these kinds of scourings properly a straining to go to the stoole; for it cometh for the most part alway with such a force, that it driueth out the Arsegut, and the fruit of women conceiued. The cause of this scouring may be as well inward as outward cold, like as when any one doth sit vpon cold stones, or it is gotten of the cold ayre, or in the water: contrariwise also it may be caused through heate and drought. Item, of any sharpe rheume of the stomacke or Lyuer, of corrupted meates, or much moysture, through the vse of much fruite, through wormes, impo∣stumation of the bowels, binding in the bodie, swelling of the Pyles, and also of any tough and subtle Phlegma. The signes whereof are easily to be discerned by the report of the patient, and view of the place, and ordure. Now as touching the remedies, Clisters are best of all for it. If this maladie do come of cold, then make the Clister thus: Take Mints, Marierom, Cammo∣mill, Melilot, field Mints, Southernwood, of each one handfull, decoct them in sufficient water. Take of this decoction twelue or sixteene ounces, oyle of Cammomill, and of Lillies, of each one ounce and a half; then make this Clister very warme: but if there come any binding or stopping with it, then temper therewith Benedictam laxatiuam, or Hieram picram, three quarters of an ounce or one ounce. The herbs and all that be decocted for this Clister, stampe them all to pap, and temper them with oyle of Rue and of Lillies, and let it boyle a little while, and lay it vpon the place where the paine is, and when it is cold, then lay on another that is warme, doing this 3. or 4. times one after another. When as then this strayning of going to the stoole is red, then are you to vse this following: Take steeled Cow milk or Goats milk, Mutton broth, or Veale broth twelue or sixteene ounces, melt therin one ounce, or one ounce and a half of Shéepes suet, and two ounces of the oyle of Roses, then temper them together, & vse this Clister oftentimes. Item take twelue ounces of Malmesy, the yolke of an Egge, let them boyle togither in a drin∣king pot or kan in a Kettle of water vntil it be very hote, then giue it afterwards vnto the pati∣ent it is a very safe remedie. When all necessarie medicines haue beene vsed to this kinde of laske, and yet the paine doth not diminish in ten dayes, then may one vse the Clister which is described in the 17. §. beginning thus: Take peeled Lupins &c. and that at two or three times as the case shall import. If these scourings be of a cold cause, then rost Millet or Panick with salt, and lay vpon it, or fill thrée bags with Bran, let them boyle in wine or water, lay one of them vpon the belly, another vpon the back beneath, and the third vpon the fundament, as warme as may be possibly suffered, and when they be cold make them warme againe. After∣wards annoynt the place with warme oyle or with the salue Marciaton, and sprinkle wine vpō a hote stone, then lay a cloth vpon it against the burning, and sit vpon it with the buttocks as hote as may be suffered. Others do counsell for to foment the fundament with red Wine, wherein the herbe Ʋerbascum hath beene sodden, and afterwards to sit vpon a hote Oake or Cipers wooden boord. Some do commend for this a Poplar boord: or if one cannot get such a one, then a Firre boord, and as soone as one is cold, then to take another warmed againe, and v∣sing this so long vntill he féele the warmth within the belly. Then is the fundament to be an∣noynted with molten Harts suet, or to fume it with Pitch, like as not long ago hath béene re∣hearsed. Item, Holyhock rootes, Linseede, Fenegréeke, Cammomill, Melilot, the vpper sprigs of Coleworts, of each three ounces, powne thē all together, & séeth them in reasonable water. You are therewith to wet a sponge, wring it out, & sit theron, and lay it vpon the fundament; yea, to sit also in the water. Item, take the séeds of Plantain, prepared Coriander, Mirtle séede, Acorne cups, yellow séeds of Roses, Cipers nuts, of each one dragme and a halfe, Gum, & Dragagant, (both parched) of each one ounce, beate them together, and put them in a bag, and séethe them
with Wine, then must one sit hote thereon. Item, seeth oaken leaues with water in a bag, and hold the fundament vnto the heate of it, and when it is cold, make it hote againe, and do this oftentimes one after another. For a salue: Take oyle of Roses one quarter of an ounce, Saffron xv. graines, Shéepes sewet, Deere sewet, of each one ounce, make a salue thereof, it doth maruellously take away the paine. Another. Take Frankinsence, Lycium, Saffron, Gum, Opium, of each one dragme, vnripe oyle of Oliues, Colophonia, of each thrée dragmes, Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make a salue with it, the lard of a Bore, and of all fourefooted beasts: also the fat of all Foules is espe∣ciall good to be vsed for this disease. You shall take for a plaister Hollihock rootes, Linseede, Fenegreeke, of each one ounce seeth them wel, and powne them togither, and temper amongst it half an ounce of powned Cammo∣mill, the yolks of two Egs, and lay it against the fundament. For this, may you also take Gar∣lick boyled to grout, the heads of Leekes fryed in Butter, with oyle of Roses, and a little Waxe made into salue may also be vsed for this purpose. For this is also requisite the fume and vapor of diuers things, as the leaues of a Pearetree, of Medlars, Quinces, Dragon bloud, fine Bolus, blossomes of Pomegranates, and sealed earth, whereof you may seeth (which you please) with Wine. When as then the patient hath bene at stoole, then is he to receiue beneath the vapor of this wine powred on a hote stone. Item, take a hote brick, sprinkle it with Wine and Mastick, vse it as before. Or make a fume with Colo∣phonia or Pitch. This confection also following may be vsed: Take Mirtle séeds, Pomegranate blossomes, Roses, and Pomegranat pils, of each halfe a handfull, Butchers broome seedes, Sorrell seedes, the séed of Plantaine, yellow Rose séedes, Barberies, white Saunders, Mastick, burnt Iuorie, of each one quarter of an ounce, Annis, séedes of Endiue, Cypers rootes, and Frankinsence, of each one dragme and a halfe, prepared Coriander, Cinnamome, red Corrall, of each halfe a dragme, the iuice of Sloes, Hypocistis, Storax, Cypers nuts, parched Gum, of each one drag. white Poppie séede thrée dragmes, powne all that is to be powned, and with dissolued Sugar make thereof a confection: you are also to put vnto it some iuice of Pomegranates. Item, take the bones of the head of a fresh taken Pickrell, the waight of a dragme and a halfe, stamp them small, and drinke them with Wine, or any fresh broth. This is taken for to be a most sure ex∣periment. Suppositories which are to be vsed are these: Take Frankinsence, Myrrhe, Gum, Linséede, of each one quarter of an ounce, Opium, Saffron, of each halfe a dragme, temper all these with the white of an Egge, and make thereof short suppositories, then bind theron a strong threed, so that you may pluck them out whē you wil. Some do put Smallage vnto it. These are now the principall remedies for this scouring: but if so be that there be other causes with it, as wormes, obstructions, and swellings, wherof we haue here before made mention; you may reade of ei∣ther in his proper description. And for a conclusion, all bitter, sharpe, and sowre things are to be refrained, for that all such make the going to the stoole, gnawing, excoriating, & painfull. Pullet broth, Barley pap, oaten pap, and such like light meates, are very commodious for him, and aboue all things must he be∣ware of cold. Of the paine in the stomacke in generall. §. 22. THese kinds of lasks and bloudy flixes haue awhile seduced me from the infirmi∣ties of the stomacke, and because these lasks (as hath bene shewed) for the most part procéede from the weaknesse of the stomack, with an infection of the Liuer & other parts moe, it would in no wise haue bin decent to haue treated of them elsewhere. But now we purpose to procéede with our intent, and write of the paine in the stomacke, and of all that appertaineth vnto it. This paine of the stomacke may be caused of diuers and sundry meanes, to wit, of some out∣ward blowes, fals, wounds, of a pirrcing cold, or extreame heate, of a bad digestion, that hath long continued, of ouermuch meate or drinke, eating either too hote or too cold things,
or of windes contained in the stomacke: and in fine, of all the foure humours of the body, also with or without an impostume. And indéed in this paine of the stomacke, and also in all paines of the Liuer, it were very needfull to vse the counsell of an expert Phisition, that might discerne and know whence these infirmities procéede, and whereon each symptome dependeth. For if in this point any error be committed, then is this maladie imparted vnto all the parts of con∣coction. Wherefore great héed must be taken what ought to be vsed in euery accident, for as their causes be diuers, so also do they differ in their signes. If this infirmitie be procured by some outward occasion, that is to be knowen of the patient himselfe: or if the cause be a bad digestion of the stomacke, that is perceiued by the sower bel∣chings. If it come by ouerlading of the stomacke and bad digestion, then doth the patient find a heauinesse in the stomacke, with wamblings and vomitings, and good ease after them. If it be caused of heate, then feeleth he a gnawing, heate, drought, and sweetenesse in the mouth, because it procéedeth of bloud. If it be procured of choler, then hath the patient a bitternesse and a tast of Verdegreace in his mouth. The paine that commeth of phlegme, hath alwayes a salt tast with it. Also the spettle may shew what the cause is, whence this infirmitie might procéede. Melancholie is knowen hereby, that there is neither heate, nor paine with it, but onely a sower and a bad sauour in the mouth, which also otherwhiles is perceiued by that which is brought vp by vomit: vnto this is commonly adioyned a hardnes in the spléene, and a paine in the left side. But if this paine of the stomack procéede of winds, then may you perceiue a wam∣bling and belching, or breaking of wind vpward. These are the commonest signes of all paines in the stomacke, and first we will write of the paine in the stomacke that is without an impostume. Of the paine of the stomacke without impostumation through heate. §. 23. FOr all paines of the stomacke where there is great perturbance, great wam∣bling, parbraking and vomiting, it may be iustly adiudged, that it doth procéede of an hote occasion, for which vomiting (by taking of lukewarme water) is to be prouoked; or if the same be too weake, then to put some Sallad oyle vnto it, or oyle of Dill, or oyle of Violets: the same doth also the séede of Orage, tempered with Vineger. But there be in other places other remedies moe described for to purge the patient by vomiting: and if this ease him not, then it is néedfull that the patient be purged: but first he is to take some preparatiue potions, euen as hereafter follow. Take husked Barley two ounces, Endiue and small Endiue, of each one handfull, Roses, seede of Melons, Gourds, Cucumbers, and Pompeons, and the iuice of Pomegranats, of each one ounce, Sugar nine ounces, make a cleare sirupe of it, vntill there remaine about twelue ounces, giue alwayes two ounces of it at once with Barley water or Endiue water. For this is also Oxysacchara good, made with the iuice of Limons or the iuice of Roses, where∣in is decocted a little of the iuice of Wormewood taken with Barley water. When as these po∣tions be taken, then is to be giuen for a purgation one ounce of Hiera Picra with Endiue wa∣ter: or if the patient feare the bitternesse, then may he take this following. Take Violets and Burrage flowers, of each halfe an ounce, nine or ten Prunes, sower Dates one ounce, Currans one quarter of an ounce, séeth them in twelue ounces of water, so that there remaine after the straining out foure ounces of the decoction, then lay to stéepe in this warme Colature one ounce of the rindes of yellow Mirobalans, let it stand the space of one night vpon warme ashes, being strained through in the morning, temper halfe an ounce of Cassie with it. There is also to be giuen daily to the patient, bread which hath bene stéeped in the iuice of Pomegranats, and Syrupum Acetosum, de Cydonijs with it, and (as is sayd before) Mutton broth and such like. Moreouer, the Iulep of Roses, of Violets, wine of Pomegranats, Veriuice, with water wherein Lettice, Purslaine, and Endiue were boyled, be very good for this maladie. After purging, the patient may drinke otherwhiles Buttermilk and well water, if so be no im∣postumation in the stomacke do let the same. He may also eate well Lettice and Purslaine with small vineger, Melons, and Cucumbers: all his other meates must be light of digesture, as
Hens, Pullets, Partridges, and small fishes drest with vineger, Citrons, Oranges and Li∣mons be very méete for him. White cleare wine is tolerable for this if it be well watred, but if so be that there come a drouth with this heate, then must moyst things be ministred, as namely, Mallowes, Spinage, and such like. And further also to vse water baths: in fine, all that wanteth for this is to be ta∣ken and had in the 6. §. where we haue discoursed of a weake stomacke through heate. Of the paine of the stomacke without impostumation through cold. §. 24. IF so be that this paine of the stomacke be bewrayed through belching, then is it ea∣sily to be marked, that the same paine is caused through some wind, which is in∣gendred through cold. Therefore are we here to shew whence the same is caused: But as much as concerneth the Belching, it shall hereafter be spoken of. Of the paine in the stomacke through wind. §. 25. THis is the maladie of the stomacke, the which we call Belching, and the Latinists do call it Ructum, the which is none other but the wind which nature expelleth through the mouth, and it is thus described. Belching is an ascending wind which commeth out of the stomacke, and is not digested, but is driuen out through the expulsiue vertue of the stomacke. This is caused of a flegmaticke matter, or meate which is resolued in the stomacke into wind, through the féeblenesse of naturall heate, and is expelled out of the stomacke. Like as for example we apparantly sée, that in time of great heate or great cold, the weather is least of all clowdie or foggie. The causes of these belchings may well be a féeble heate of the stomacke, which cannot di∣gest sufficiently. And albeit there be warmth enough, yet hath he nothing but windie meates to worke vpon; and the belching which procéedeth of great heate, happeneth but two or thrée times one after another. The windy meates are these, vz. porredge of Beanes, Pease, Rye bread, Swines flesh, Chestnuts, Figs, dried Cherries, Must, and all cold meates, which do a∣bate the naturall heate: also rosted Egs, Onions, Radishes, and all that be of such natures. This belching may also be caused of superfluous meats or drinkes, for if they cannot be con∣sumed, then do they ingender wind. Also this may well be caused by a cold rheume, which falleth also into the stomacke, through want of sléepe, through some vnnaturall heate or cold, through ouer hot or cold baths, through mightie motions, and through thrusts vpon the stomacke, and also by brusing or wounding of other parts, which hinder digestion. The signes of this belching are these: first when one hath neither smelling nor tast, before he haue taken his meate. Secondly, the stench declareth an vlceration or stinking matter in the stomacke. Thirdly, if the rising of the meate taken, be sowre, and the smatch commeth vp againe with it: then is it a signe of a bad digestion. Fourthly, if the belching do come after A∣sthma, or after an heauy breath, then is it good and profitable. Fiftly, in like sort it is very fit, if that any wind comprehended in the stomacke be belched vp. But if the wind will not auoid the stomake, then is there some other infirmitie to be looked for. Sixtly, the reasonable belching (if so be that the digestion be not thereby annoyed) is very commodious, and the digestion much holpen with it. Seuenthly, all they who haue many soure belchings, do not lightly get any pricking or shooting in the breast. Eightly all they which be awaked out of their sound sléepe, do not well digest, and be much subiect to belching, and that more or lesse according to the meate receiued. Ninthly, the belching which tasteth like Verdigrease betokeneth a great heate and a stinking matter in the stomacke. And now to procéede to the remedies for the belching, there be first certaine sure rules to be kept and obserued. First, if there ingender any wind in the bodie which nature would willingly expell, then is it not to be detained at any hand; notwithstanding, for reuerence sake, to forbeare it in the pre∣sence of other folkes. Secondly, one ought to beware of all surfetting and superfluitie of meate.
Thirdly, all cold is to be refrained, and especially coldnesse of the féete. Fourthly al they that be plagued with sowre belchings, are to vse Diatrion pipereon, and such like, and to drinke it with wine; but they who haue onely certaine vapors ascending from the stomacke, they are to be holpen with Wormwood or Hiera Picra. Fiftly, all they that do belch of an ill stomacke or bad digestion, they must liue very soberly. Sixtly, sobrietie and warmth of the stomacke is passing good for all belching from the stomacke. Now if that this belching do procéede of a cold stomacke, then is the patient to be kept mar∣uellous sober, and to eate nothing but light meate, and therewith to vse one of these things fol∣lowing, as Diacyminum, Dianisum, Diagalanga, Diapipereon, Aromaticum rosatum. Or let these con∣fections be made: Take Species Diacinamomum, Diambra, Diagalanga, of each one dragme, Sugar sixe ounces, seeth them with the water of Mints or Hyssope, & make Tabulats of it. This be∣ing made, then vse one quarter of an ounce of it, or halfe an ounce at once. It expelleth all winds of the stomacke, it consumeth all cold matter of the bowels, and is very commodious for the stomacke and the lyuer, taken before beate. Item, take powned Galingale one dragme, drinke it euery morning with wine. Item, Cinnamom chewed long in the morning, doth also auoide all wind. In like manner the confection of Bay berries doth vehemently expell all winds out of the stomacke, and out of all other parts. Or make this following: Take Annis, Spikenard, Mace, Louage, and séedes of Rue, of each halfe a dragme, Commin one quarter of an ounce Sene leaues one ounce, Argall one dragme and a halfe, hony of Roses foure ounces and a halfe, Sugar halfe an ounce, the Sugar and Hony shall be boyled vntill they be thick in the water of Hyssope, and temper the rest amongst them: take sometimes also halfe a dragme or one dragme of fine Treacle, or Mithridate in good wine. Potions, and such like. TAke an old Cocke or Hen, stop it full of Cinnamom, Cloues, Ginger, and Zeduarie, as much as you thinke good, let them séeth well, and drinke of this broth euery morning eight ounces at one time. Or drinke in the morning a good draught of wine, wherein be stéeped Nutmegs, Galingale and Cloues. A little Aqua vitae is also very good. You may like∣wise vse for this vitall waters, Conserues of Betonie, of Eyebright, Gilloflower wine. Betony wine, and wine of Eyebright, are very meete for all cold diseases of the stomacke. Of sirupes are especial good for this disease, the sirupe of Wormwood, of Mints, of Quinces, and aboue all de Calamintha. Or make this following: Take Marioram, rumpled Mints, Wormwood, and Penniroyall, of each one handful, Hony water foure and twenty ounces, one quart of good white wine, séeth the hearbes euen to the half, then strain it and clarifie the broth, put as much Hony vnto it as you thinke good; temper afterwards amongst it Ginger, Galin∣gale, Lignum Aloes, Citron péeles and Spikenard, of each one quarter of an ounce, then make a sirupe of it, like as in the first part and the 6. §. is taught. Also you may temper with it Com∣min, Fennell, Caraway, Annis, Cloues, Mother cloues, or Cinnamom. For all these things do expell wind, and strengthen the stomacke. These pils following do not purge, but expell wind: Take Asarabacca, Commin, Fennell, and Annis, of each one quarter of an ounce, the seedes of Rue, rootes of Mandragora, of each one scruple, Beuercod one dragme and a halfe, make as many pils of it as you please, and vse one dragme or one dragme and a halfe of it at one time. For when one will purge, then take these pils following: Take Indie salt halfe a scruple, washt Aloes two scruples, Pil. Alephanginae one quarter of an ounce, temper them together, and make seuen or eight pils of them, and vse them at one time. Suppositories which do draw downe the winds. TAke Ammoniacum one quarter of an ounce, Opopanacum one dragme, Waxe two ounces, Turpentine thrée ounces, Indie Salt one dragme and a halfe, Saltpeter two ounces and a halfe, Rue, Caraway, Siluer mountaine séed, Cuscuta, Centorie, Coloquint, Com∣min, Swines bread, of each one dragme and a halfe, Colophonia, one quarter of an ounce, melt the Gum, the Waxe and Turpentine, and temper the rest (being beaten) amongst it. Then make suppositories of it the bignes of a small finger.
Others do take Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Opopanacum, of each one quarter of an ounce, Saga∣penum, one dragme and a half, dissolue them in vineger, temper them afterwards in foure oun∣ces of molten Hony, and put Swines bread vnto it, Coloquint, Turbith, and the rootes of Ferne, of each one dragme, Scammonie one quarter of an ounce, parched Salt one ounce and a halfe, then make thicke suppositories of it: for this are you to abate or increase the described waight more or lesse, according to the importance of the cause; for they be very strong, and draw downe the wind and the ordure very vehemently. This powder following is also very good for all winds: Take Marioram, Rue, Mints, A∣meos, Masticke and Frankinsence, of each thrée dragmes, Cloues halfe a dragm, make a pow∣der of them, and giue thereof one dragme at the same time. Another: Take Cinnamome one ounce, Ginger thrée quarters of an ounce, Cloues halfe an ounce, Galingale one quarter of an ounce, Nutmegs thrée dragmes, Cardamome one drag. and a halfe, Mace one dragm, Pepper one quarter of an ounce, Spica one dragme, Comin three quarters of an ounce, Saffron one dragme and a halfe, Sugar one ounce and a halfe: take one dragme thereof with good warme wine. Here followeth that which is outwardly to be vsed. TAke Millet and Salt, parch them well, then put vnto them Parietarie and Nettles, and lay them warme vpon the stomacke. Or séeth Rue, Marioram, Cammomill and Mints in wine, and wet a sponge in it, or a woollen clout, wring it out, and lay it warme vpon the stomacke. You may also séeth the same herbes in Sallad oyle, and annoint the stomacke with it, and then lay it warme thereon with vndrest shéepes wooll. Another oyntment: Take Rue one handfull, Beuercod one quarter of an ounce, Annis one ounce, Aristologie two ounces, red Wine thrée ounces, oyle of Bery foure ounces, powne them all grossely that are to be powned, and let them séeth vpon hote ashes vntill the wine be boyled away: then wring it thorough a cloth, and with Waxe make a salue of it for the stomacke. These oyles following are very necessarie for him: to wit, oyle of Rue, of Mandragora, of Penniroyall, of Dill, of Spica, and Bayberries, mixt together or each alone. This plaister fol∣lowing is very good for to consume the wind of the stomack, of the lyuer, and of the milt: Take Ammoniacum, Opopanacum, Turpentine, Rosin, of each halfe an ounce, Cardainome, Cypers rootes, Sauin trée, Saltpeter, Bayberies, Cassie wood, Melilot, Fenegréeke meale, Smallage séedes, Marioram gentle, of each one dragme, melt and pown them as behooueth, and then tem∣per them with the oyle of Spike and of Waxe, as much as is needfull for to make a plaister; spread it on a leather, and couer it with Syndall, and so lay it ouer the stomacke. You shall haue also hereafter a good plaister against the obstruction of the lyuer with cold, beginning: Take Roses fiue dragmes, &c. which plaister is also meete for this purpose. This fomentation is also maruellous méete for this: Take Wormwood, Mints, Marioram, rumpled Mints, Fennell séede, Dill seede and Commin, of each one handfull & a half, Masticke, red and white Corall, Gallia Muscata, of each one dragm, Roses two handfuls, Squinant, Mir∣tle séede and Coriander, of each one handfull and a halfe, wild Vine leaues one handfull and a half (but not Bryonie) cut them all grosse, and then séeth them all in thrée quarts of wine vnto the halfe (except the Gallia Muscata) this is to be put last of all vnto it, when as the decoction is strained. Then foment the stomacke with it with a great sponge. These bags are also to be made; Take the séedes of Smallage, Annis, Siluer mountaine, Fennell seedes, Stone Parsly and of Rue, of each one handfull, Marioram, white water Mints, of each one handfull and a halfe, Hyssope, Penniroyall, Stechas, Rue, field Cypers, of each one handfull, Wormwood two handfuls, Calmus, Cinnamome, and Cloues, of each one quarter of an ounce, Mace thrée dragmes, cut it and beate it all together, and afterwards put it in a bag. Item, rub the stomack with Aqua vitae. This is also very good and commodious: Item, set a great boxing cup vpon the stomacke vnpickt, &c. But you shall incontinent hereafter see more of this, where we do speake of the griping and paine of the belly, because that they do both procéed out of one kind of cause.
Of the swelling or puffing vp of the stomacke. §. 26. IF the swelling or puffing vp of the stomacke be caused of wind, that is easily percei∣ued through the forementioned reasons. But because that it may also happen very well through impostumation and other occasions, and that the same is to be out∣wardly séene and knowne, therefore are we here to adde vnto this somewhat there∣of. When as then any wind doth sticke in the stomacke, that will passe neither vpwards nor downewards, then will it of necessitie puffe vp the stomacke, and extend it with great per∣plexitie, and if the same procéede through any impostumation, one may well perceiue the same outwardly: what then the causes and signes of these winds be, that is sufficiently discoursed in the forementioned third part, and 25. §. But as concerning the impostumation, we will shortly hereafter speake of it: and if so be there be any maladie of the Milt with it, then looke in∣to the description of the infirmities of the same, and mixe the same things with it which do serue for it. Of the paine of the stomacke through Phlegma. §. 27. IF so be that the paine of the stomacke do come through Phlegma, and with a salt humor, then is the patients mouth salt, and hath also heate and thirst with it. And in case the same be caused of any other kind of Phlegma, then is there no thirst with it, but only anguish and drouth, and one may know by the tong the tast of the matter which causeth this paine. Or is the Phlegma much aboun∣ding? then wil the appetite be lost, with other causes moe, whereof we haue spo∣ken already. For this, is first counselled to take Oxymel of Squils, with the decoction of Hyssop, & that afterwards he is to be vrged to vomit, with Mustard, Hony, salt fish, Radish, & Garlick, or vse this decoction: Take Squils two ounces, séedes of Orage thrée ounces, Radishes foure ounces, Vineger two ounces, and a quart of water, let these séeth together vnto the halfe at least. When you haue eaten before two or thrée slices of a Radish, then drinke two ounces of this decoction, tempered with one ounce of Sallad oyle, and a short time after sée if you can cast vp somewhat. But if the stomacke be not therwith sufficiently clensed, one may perceiue by it, to wit, by reason that thereby followeth not any ease at all. Then be these sirupes following to be prepared: Take Mints, Wormwood, Hyssop, Venus haire, all gréene (if so be that they be to be gotten) of each a handfull, Parsly rootes, Fennell rootes, of each one ounce and a halfe, Annis, Fennell, Ameos, Licorice, Corans, Vineger, of each one ounce, Hony and Sugar, of each sixe ounces, make a cleare sirupe of it. For this is Oxymel of Squils also good. As it is needfull in all other sicknesses, that the Phlegma be purged: so it is also néedfull in this, as thus: Take Burrage, and the flowers of Buglosse, of each halfe an ounce, Annis one ounce, Licorice, Corans, of each two ounces, rootes of Polipodie halfe an ounce, séeth them al in water so long that there remaine about fiue or sixe ounces: then stéepe therein one ounce of the rinds of Mirobalans Chebuli, whilest that the decoction is still hote, and so let it stand all night in warme ashes, afterwards straine it out, and take thrée or foure ounces of this decocti∣on, and put thereto halfe a dragme of Turbith, and one scruple of Ginger, and then giue it him early in the morning: or giue to the patient of the purging Marmalade, like as it is, described in the last part of this booke. For this is also to be giuen thrée or foure dragms of the rotules of Diaphenicon, or the Electuarium or Diasena. But if in case he had rather take pils, then let him vse some of these following, to wit, Stomachicae, De Aloe lota, and Cochiae: afterwards must the sto∣macke be warmed with all kind of spiced Wines, as Hippocras, and such like. Also with losin∣ges of Diatrion pipereon, Diagalanga, &c. Item, confected Ginger, Annis, Comin, and Mints, mixed or confected with Sugar. All his meates are to be strewed with Ginger, with Cloues, Galingall, Pepper, and Cinnamome, and they are also to be drest with it. This confection following is maruellous good for all féeblenesse, cold, & bad digestion of the stomacke, and also against all hoarsenes. Take Comine which hath bene stéeped in Vineger and is dryed againe, fiue dragmes, Annis, Smallage seede, dryed Mints, Marioram gentle, Calmus, Rosemary, Marioram, and Penniroyall, of each three dragms, Spica, Cloues, Carda∣mome,
Nutmegs, of each one quarter of an ounce, long and common Pepper, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Lignum Aloes one dragme and a halfe: temper them together, and make a subtill powder of it, and afterwards with Hony, into a confection. The Trocisci de Rosis, do hin∣der the matter that it runne not againe after purging, towards the stomacke. If that halfe an ounce of it be taken with Wine, it comforteth, asswageth the paine, and very much assisteth digestion. Item, annoint the stomack with the oyle of Spike, Masticke, or oyle of Wormwood. For a Plaister may be vsed that which is described before in the 5. §. beginning thus: Take Masticke thrée ounces, &c. If there be great cold approching, then giue the patient one dragme of Mithridate or Treacle, with wine wherein Annis and Wormewood haue bene decocted. Of the paine at the stomacke through Melancholia. §. 28. THis paine of the stomacke bringeth with her, together with the foresaid signes, a sowre smatch also vpon the tongue, great desire or longing for meate, but without digestion, with disquietnes, lasks, and vomiting, which do commonly come all together. For these kinds of maladies do people come commonly to be wonderfull féeble and voide of might, for that the hart which is nearest vnto it cannot tolerate this ouerlading and burthen. Thus then to remedie these grie∣uous melancholick humors which do sinke into the stomacke, these sirupes following are to be vsed: Take Burrage rootes, Parsly rootes, and Fennell rootes, of each one ounce and a halfe, the inner part of Squils one ounce, Mints, Hyssope, Harts tongue, Venus haire, being all gréene, (if they can be gotten) of each one handfull, Fennell séede, Annis séede, Cuscuta, Licorice, Co∣rans, Vineger, of each one ounce, Hony and Sugar, of each sixe ounces, make thereof a si∣rupe. Another. Take Licorice and Raisins, of each one ounce, flowers of Burrage, Buglosse, Fennell, Annis, Fennell rootes, and Cuscuta, of each halfe an ounce, Ginger one quarter of an ounce, Honie and Sugar, of each sixe ounces, make foorthwith a sirupe of it, or in stead thereof vse Oxymel of Squils, with water of Burrage, which taketh away the belching of the stomacke. For to purge, this following may be vsed: Take water of Burrage, and of Buglosse, of each one ounce, Annis one quarter of an ounce, Licorice and Corans, of each one ounce, Thymus and wild Thyme, Polypodie rootes, of each halfe an ounce: séethe them together, and steepe therein one ounce of Mirobalani Indi the space of a whole night, then wring it well out, and temper with it one dragme of Azure stone prepared, and giue it to the patient betimes in the morning. There may also be vsed for to purge, the confection of Sene leaues, afterwards strengthen the stomacke with the confection Aromatico Caryophilato, Diapliris cum Moscho, Laetitia Galeni, Diathamaron, and annoint the same with the foresaid oyle. His meate shall he strew measu∣rably with spices: he must drink but a little old Wine. He must vse moderate exercise, and bath often. All that is outwardly to be done is to be taken out of the 24. §. But if so be that there be any belching procéeding of vnnaturall heate, (which neuertheles chaunceth very seldome) then is the patient to vse the sirupe of Wormewood, or Wormwood wine, or Wormwood water. In like sort also he is to purge afterwards with Hiera Picra, and not to disquiet himselfe, for that these medicines be hote of nature, because they do purge both Choleram and the stomacke. Otherwise must this patient be ordered, like as in the debilitie of the stomacke through heate, is taught in the 6. §. And good héed is to be taken that the dige∣stiue vertue may be strengthened. Set also a great boxing cup vpon the belly without picking the space of one houre, yet otherwhiles taking it off, and afterwards annoint the stomack with the foresaid oyle, or some other oyle, wherein Annis, Comin, Fennell, Rue, or Penniroyall, is decocted. The Aristology hath also a great power to expell all wind and paine of the stomacke. And as concerning the order of life, or diet, there is alwaies to be vsed all light meates, and white wine, and that with sobrietie.
Of the paine in the stomacke through a hote impostume. §. 29. THese impostumes which the Gréeks do call Apostema, and the Latinists Absces∣sus, are like a separation from that which is whole and firme in a mans body, or is separated into two parts, and doth make an exulceration, which we do call in our common spéech an Impostume, as a word lent vs from the Gre∣cians themselues: but in our English tong we do call an impostume a Botch or a Byle, which commeth to an issue which breaketh out and healeth. The diffe∣rence betwéene an impostume and an exulceration is, that the impostume breaketh out and healeth spéedily; but an exulceration endureth long and corrodeth, like as the same may also happen in the stomacke. The causes of these impostumes may be blowes, fals, and other outward bruses; all which do make paine in the stomacke, which groweth afterwards vnto an Impostume, through the falling downe of some bad humors into it: so that if the foresaid humors be not drawne thence, then there befalleth more harme vnto it. And that we may write somewhat of it, we will first begin with the hote impostume. In case then that with the paine in the stomacke there be an Ague & an impostume, which may outwardly be felt through the heate and otherwise; then may it easily be adiudged, that this disease is caused through heate and Cholera. It hapneth also that the paines is so vehement, so intolerable, and the heate so abundant, that it séemeth that the patient would burne: so that he loseth his senses, and thereby hapneth also to fall into a frenzie or some other madnesse, with a forcible vomiting and parbraking. For this, must the Liuer veine or Median be opened, & afterwards these Refrigerations to be forthwith layd vpon it. Take Rose water sixe ounces, the iuice of Quinces one ounce and a halfe, red and white Saunders, of each one quarter of an ounce, Camfere one scruple; temper them all together: This is (as it is said) to be vsed at the beginning. Afterwards, if the cause requireth, there must be sundry plaisters made readie. The first is this ensuing: Take red and white Saunders, of each one quarter of an ounce, the séede of Plantaine, of Purslaine and Wormwood, of each one dragme and a halfe, Barly meale two ounces, Camfere one scruple, oyle of Roses and of Quinces, of each one ounce and a halfe; let them séethe all together vntill it be thicke. But in the increase of the paine, then temper amongst this plaister the grease of Ducks and Hens, as much as is néedfull: and when as this maladie is at the highest, put Smallage vnto it, Dates, Fenegréeke, Bdellium and Vineger, of each one quarter of an ounce, and then mixe it as is aforesaid. But if the disease begin to waxe old, yt the heate were gone, & yet there remaine neuertheles a hardnes of the stomack, then be one of these plasters following to be laid vpon it: take Violets two dragmes and a halfe, Roses fiue dragms, Spike and Masticke, of each thrée dragmes, Ci∣pers rootes, Squinant and Calmus, of each one quarter of an ounce, Fenegréeke meale two ounces and a halfe, Cammomill, Hollihocke rootes and Barly meale, of each one quarter of an ounce; temper them all together with the muscilage of Linséede vnto a pap. This pappe is also good for all hard swellings of the stomack, & of the Liuer: it asswageth the paine, and ripeneth all impostumations. Or in the steade of this you may also vse this plaister of Meliloto, Diachylon, or Ceroton de Hyssopo, and foure howers after meate, when the meate is digested, the stomacke is to be annointed with the oyle of Masticke and Wormewood, and further the place couered with sheepes wooll. Item, take Pitch and Rosin, of each two ounces, Colophonia one ounce and a halfe, Mastick and Frankinsence, of each one quarter of an ounce, Aloe one ounce and a halfe, molten Lard one ounce, oyle of Masticke foure ounces, gréene Waxe as much as suffiseth for a plaister: you may also make a salue of it: and it is very good both wayes. It is also néedfull for to purge, which must be effected with mild Clisters, whereof diuers stand here and there declared. Afterwards giue the patient one ounce of Cassie, or two ounces of Manna dissolued in Endiue water. And if this do not sufficiently relaxe, then giue him eue∣ry day one ounce, or one ounce and a halfe of Cassie. And in case that the Ague do not remit, then open a veine, and purge once againe as before. Take thrée dragms of péeled Gourd séeds, make thereof milke with Barly water, and thrée dragmes of Rosewater, like vnto Almond
milke. Seuen dayes after, giue him halfe a dragme of Trociscis de Rosis tempered with Endiue water. He is afterwards to take euery day this ensuing: Take of the water of Smallage, and Fennell water, of each one ounce, the iuice of Wormwood one quarter of an ounce, Masticke, one dragme; temper them together, and vse one of the prescribed plaisters, Barley paps, Oa∣ten paps, and otherwhiles stued Spinage may he wel eate. Or Burrage boyled in Hen broth, and Almond milke is very méete for him. Stued Peares, Apples, Quinces, and ripe Plums may he also eate. Water or Sugar water must be his drinke. In fine, such kind of sicke folke must be kept very sober, for that is the best medicine for this sicknesse. Of the impostumes of the stomacke, which be of a cold nature. §. 30. IF so be that this impostume of the stomacke do procéede of a cold and moyst cause, which may quickly be perceiued through the small paine, the bad digesti∣on of the stomacke, small Ague, little thirst, and much spettle: then is the patient to be holden very sober in meate and drinke, and beware of vomiting and pur∣ging: but at the first must be giuen him one dragme, or one dragme and a halfe of these Trociscis following. Take Squinant, Cassie wood, Rubarb, and Calmus of each thrée drag. Saffron, Myrrhe, Costus, Annis and Pepper, of each one dragme, Bdellium three dragmes, Masticke one quar∣ter of an ounce, Ammoniacum one dragme, forme Trociscos of it with vine euict. Afterwards you may vse this plaister following: Take Cammomill & Melilot, of each one ounce, Fennell, Roses, Cipers nuts and the leaues, of each halfe an ounce, Fenegréeke meale, oyle of Cammomill, and oyle of Roses, of each one ounce: temper them together vnto a plaister. Or make this plaister following: Take Cammomill, Melilot, Preists crowne, Penniroy∣all and Dill, of each halfe a dragme, VVormwood and Spikenard, of each three dragmes, Ma∣sticke one quarter of an ounce, oyle of Roses foure ounces, make a pap of it with the muscilage of Hollihocke rootes. But when this disease is increasing and at the chiefe, then put Ammoniacum, Opopanacum dis∣solued in wine, and liquid Styrax vnto it, of each halfe a dragme, Hens and Goose grease, of each one ounce, oyle of Spica sixe ounces, and make a plaister of it. This is forcible to ma∣turate all Impostumes. For this is also good the plaisters de Meliloto, and the blacke Dia∣chylon. For the common man, take oyle of Wormwood and Goates dung; temper them vnto a plaister: Or take oyle wherein Wormwood hath bene decocted, Mallowes boyled in Mutton broth and drest with butter. Now for to expell this cold matter, this Sirupe following is to be vsed: Take Mints, Wormwood, Venus haire, being all gréene (if they can be gotten) of each thrée handfuls, Roses one ounce, Annis one quarter of an ounce, Cipers nuts, Spikenard, of each one dragme, hony of Roses twelue ounces: then make a sirupe of it, like as in the first part, in the first chapter, and §. 6. is taught: giue thereof euery morning, and in the euening before supper halfe an ounce, with the decoction of Mints and Masticke. For a purgation he is to take one ounce of Hiera Pi∣cra, tempered with thrée dragms of Cassie and Sugar, or dissolue it with the foresaid decoction, and then drinke it. Afterwards the patient is to take euery third day this prescribed Laxa∣tiue. Héede is also to be taken therein, when as the impostume in the stomacke will breake out, which may be well perceiued hereby; to wit, if there be great paine about the place where the impostume is. Likewise when the patient doth eate sower and harsh things: if in going to the stoole, or in any thing that he vomiteth, there be séene any corruption. Item, if there come any stench out of the stomacke, and that the paine diminisheth somwhat after he hath vomited: for this the stomacke is to be cleansed well in Sommer season with Barly water, and that in the mornings especially, and at afternoone, taking euery time fiue or sixe ounces. Or take water wherein Gum and Licorice haue bene decocted. For this is Whay also very requisite. He is two howers afterwards to take one quarter
of an ounce of this powder following tempered with foure ounces of the iuice of Quinces, or sirupe of the same in water wherein Butchers broome séede, Mirtle séede, and Purslaine séede haue bene decocted. In the winter must the stomack be also clensed at the same time with Bar∣ly water wherein Hyssope, Squinant, Honie, or hony of Roses were decocted, and thereupon to vse this powder following. Take Roses, blossomes of Pomegranates, and Amber, of each halfe an ounce, fine Bolus three quarters of an ounce: mixe them well together being beaten small. This patient may also weare this plaister ensuing vpon his stomacke: Take fine Bolus, Momy, Myrrhe, Masticke, and Aloe, of each halfe an ounce, Pitch or Rosin as much as is néedfull for to make a plaister. Of exulcerations in the stomacke. §. 31. WHat difference there is betwéene the impostume and the exulceration of the sto∣macke, we haue sufficiently declared in the 29. §. therefore haue the learned by good reason written of these two kinds of diseases seuerally. As much as concer∣neth the exulcerations, the which the Latinists do call Vlcera, they grow other∣whiles of the impostumes and chiefly if they be hote. For if the same be not thoroughly healed, then doth this exulceration follow. The same be sometimes caused through cholericke and sharpe rheumes, which fall out of the head into the stomacke, and there then through their sharpnesse do excoriate the stomacke; like as the same happeneth oftentimes to the Lights. Also these vlcerations may be caused of some sharpe and corroding meates; like as through the excessiue vse of Mustard or the séeds, much salt, and such like. For if there come of this sharpnesse into the stomack, then doth the same gnaw and corrode it. Now for to speake of the signes of it, the disease it selfe sheweth some, & doth demonstrate vnto others the place. If there be a pricking paine present, then doth it cast out the meate back againe, as a thing which is noysome vnto it, so that it cannot stay in the stomacke: whereby also the reten∣tiue vertue is enféebled. Item, if the patient do take any sowre meate or drinke, then doth the paine increase, which would not haue hapned if he had vsed milke, butter; or any other swéete meate. Item, if one do smell any kind of stench through the belching, with drouth of the mouth and thirst which procéedeth out of the stomacke; then it is a token of an exulceration in the sto∣macke. Item, for that this exulceration is so neare the heart, there do come also great swou∣nings, ach of the head, and the losse of vnderstanding. But the signes which do manifest the place of the vlcer, are these: namely, when the necke of the stomacke is excoriated, then doth the patient feele paine in the swallowing down, and especially if it be any thing which is sowre or sharpe that he swalloweth; which pain he féeleth also euen to the point of his shoulder blade, but chiefly in the mouth of the stomacke and pit of the heart. Item, if the disease be in the mouth of the stomacke, which is very sensible, then is the paine greater, and especially if one do swal∣low downe any sharpe and salt meates, whereby the breath also will be much indamaged and hindered. But if the disease be in the bottome of the stomacke, then doth one féele no paine in eating and drinking, but after that it is receiued: some signes likewise of it may be perceiued in the excrements; they that desire to haue moe other signes, may reade in the discourse of the Rheumes. But before we come to the remedies of this vlcer in the stomacke, there be certaine common rules to be noted, whereof the first is: If this disease must be holpen, then is the same alwaies to be begun with drying things. The second: albeit that it is needfull to vse drying things, yet neuerthelesse must heed he taken that there be no sharp drying things vsed, as Cop∣peras, burnt Coperas, Verdigrease, and such like, because they be of a venimous nature. The third: all vlcerations of the stomacke can be hardly cleansed of the corruption like as any other which may be outwardly séene, but it must be done onely with things which do driue it downwards out of the stomacke. The fourth: these vlcers are not through any vomits to be cleansed, for that the tough corruption is hard impacted in the vlcer, and would through vomi∣ting be drawne all together, the which the purging medicine doth not, for that it stirreth the stomacke not so sore, but driueth out the matter gently downewards. The fifth: in the exulce∣rations of the stomacke may not any strong medicine be giuen, that they be not the more har∣med by it. The sixt: without a perfect mundification can no incarnation take any place in any
vlcer. The seuenth: all which is giuen to such patients, is to be done in the morning early, or must be dispatched before supper time, to the end that the medicine through the meate might not be hindered. The eight: whether this vlcer be in the necke, or top, or in the bottome of the stomack, there must be somwhat alwaies added vnto the incarnatiues that is clammy, as Gum and Dragagant, to the end that the foresaid medicines might sticke the better, or cleaue to the place infected. The ninth: because that the stomacke is so infected of a bad digesture, you are to giue him to eate a little, and likewise light meates. When as then this maladie shall be knowne through the foresaid signes, and is yet new, then is there to be vsed none other but astringent and drying things, for which these Trocisci following are to be made: Take Roses, blossomes of Pomegranates, Frankinsence, Butchers broome séede, burnt Iuorie, and Dragon bloud, of each a like quantitie, made into Trocisces of the waight of a dragm, and giue one of them euery morning and one euery euening two hours before supper, with the iuice of Quinces or such like. But in case that this exulceration of the stomacke be of continuance, then it is to be feared that there is still some corruption in it. For this, there are to be vsed certaine daies together, mundifications, as Barly water, or Meade, and also incarnatiues. Afterwards are Barly wa∣ter and sirupe of Quinces to be vsed, and astringent things to be eaten after it, as Medlars, Seruices, and such like. Or vse in stead thereof Oxysacchara, and Oxymel, of each one ounce, temper them with Barly water, and vse it as is said. Then take one drag. of Trociscis de Carabe. Item, there is also good for this disease one dragme of Hiera Picra, often vsed with Barly water or Meade. And if the bodie haue néede of any laxatiue medicaments, then vse thereto Cassie, or any mild Clister. With this disease doth come otherwhiles the Laske, which is to be stayed with Trociscis de Spodio, or De Carabe. Note ye also here, that many of those things (which be described in the second part, the fifth Chapter, and the 17. §. against the bloudie flixe) are very requisite for this disease. This patient is to order himselfe alwaies (as is recited alreadie) with all light meates, as Pullets, Hens, Partriches, new laid Egs, Barly paps, and Oaten pappes. In like manner Lambes feete and Shéepes féete vsed in this disease, are very méete. Buttermilke is also good for this. His drinke must be ripe Wine without any sharpnes: also Barly water tempered with a stopping sirupe, which liketh you best. Of the stinking breath through the exulceration of the stomacke. §. 32. WHere as be such cholericke humors in the stomack, there is commonly a foule stench with them, which may be perceiued by the breath, and that for the most part with thirst, drouth and bitternesse of the mouth, the which discloseth it selfe more before than after meate. For this is also good the sirupe of Vineger and Oxysacchara mixt with the si∣rupe of Wormewood: this is not onely good for the cold, but also for all hot exulcerations. This patient is also to be purged with Aloe and yellow Mirobalans. Afterwards he is to vse the Ro∣tulae Triasantali, Peaches, dried Melons, Pompeons, Abricockes, Quince peares, Lettice with Vineger, Barley and other sowre things, which be very good for him. Fish, Milke, Salt flesh, Onions, Garlicke, and such like shall he forbeare. But in case that this foule stench of the stomacke do procéede of cold humors, then is the sirupe of Wormewood to be vsed certaine dayes together, tempered with one third part of Oxymel of Squils: and afterwards the patient must be purged with the pilles Stomachicae. And further to vse the Tabulates of Diagalanga, of Diambra, Diapliris, and such like, which be hote of nature. Confected Mirobalans, and especially Bellirici, and Chebuli, Conserue of Rose∣mary, or confected Ginger, are all very good. He must wash his mouth often with odoriferous waters, and cleanse the téeth very well. As much as concerneth meate and drinke, we haue made before in the first part, the thirteenth Chapter, and 3. §. a very long discourse of a stin∣king mouth and breath. Item, yet more which may there be vsed in the second Part, the fifth Chapter and 25. §.
Of the schirrositie of the stomacke. §. 33. IT commeth also oftentimes to passe, that the stomacke hapneth to harden without any exulceration, which that it may outwardly be discerned, the causes of this hardnes or schirrosity may be as well through cold, as through wind, whereof is sufficiently written before in the 25. and 26. §. Also this hardnesse may be well caused through melancholie, the which through sowre smatch of the mouth, and sowre bel∣ching may be knowne, euen as the other procéeding of Phlegma by drouth, and tough spettle, without heate and thirst. For this purpose is this salue following to be made: Take oyle of white Camlina, Rue, Cammomill, and of Wormwood, of each one ounce, the grease of Hens, Kytes, and Geese, of each halfe an ounce, the salue of Dialthea, one ounce and a halfe: annoint the stomacke warme with it, and couer it with vnwashen shéepes wooll. Also you may prepare for this vse this plaister following: Take Cammomill, Comin, Caraway, and Cresses séede, of each one ounce, Frankinsence, Mastick, Bdellium, of each halfe an ounce, Spikenard & Saf∣fron, of each one quarter of an ounce, the dregs of Sallad oyle and Waxe as much as is néedful for to make a plaister, spread the same vpon leather, and weare it on the stomacke. Or make this following: Take Waxe one ounce, Turpentine halfe an ounce, Ginger and Opopanacum, of each one quarter of an ounce, Aloe, Galbanum, of each thrée dragmes, oyle of Galingall as much as will suffise for to make a plaister. It is also very néedfull for to comfort the stomacke, whereof hath bene sufficiently admonished before. Of the Hickcough in generall. §. 34. THis disease of the stomacke, which we call the Hickcough, and is called in Latin Singultus, is a common disease, knowne vnto all men; it commeth seldome and departeth quickly, and there is no great cunning to driue it away: for it is oftentimes driuen away with a bit of bread, or with a druaght of wine or wa∣ter, as also through the kéeping in of the breath, through neesing, through great motions, through wrath, mirth, and other alterations moe of the mind: like as if any one be frighted or sée any hainous thing, if any body cast cold water into his face, if one do bind hard the outward members, or if one set boxing cups vpon the stomack, which are altogether small meanes and without danger. But there commeth otherwhiles such a Hick∣cough that ceaseth not, wherby the hart, the breast and the lights are weakened: against which the expert Phisitions haue found out these remedies following. But we will first of al discouer the nature of the Hickcough and his causes, which be descri∣bed as hereafter followeth. The Hickcough is a motion of the naturall expulsiue vertue of the stomacke, which is caused through the féeling of any thing that is hurtfull, and that the sto∣mack desireth to expell. This Hickcough may also be well taken for a crampe of the stomacke, for they be both caused through the repletion or inanition of the stomack. And like as the cramp is none other thing, but a shrinking or drawing of the sinewes backe to their beginning, so is this none other thing, but a distention or contraction of the stomacke vnto the place of her be∣ginning: but herein do they differ, that by the Cramp the sinewes are contracted, and by the Hickcough the necke of the stomacke. The cause of the Hickcough are two things, namely, repletion and windinesse, and contrariwise also inanition, as alreadie hath bene said, which we will also comprehend in this §. Secondly, the causes be also outward and inward. First, if the stomack be not well defended and kept from cold: also if the outward members, to wit, the head, the hands, and féete, do suffer too great cold, which draweth vp from thence toward the stomack. In like manner, this Hickcough is also caused well through intolerable heate, wher∣by the stomacke getteth a bad quality, to wit, too hote or too dry. Item, if the head be sore woun∣ded that the braines be thereby perished: Item, if the stomacke be much ouercharged with meate and drinke, or that any kind of corrupted humors be gathered therein. Moreouer, the Hickcough may be caused through any kind of sharpe and biting meates. For if the stomacke féele, that it hath euer any thing in it that may hurt her, then doth she vse two meanes to dis∣charge her thereof, which is, through parbraking, or through the Hickcough. It séeketh also
thereby to cast out that which lyeth inclosed in the innermost plights. But that nature desireth to driue that out through the Hickough, which otherwise through vomiting she doth easily bring to passe, this doth daily experience teach vs: for if one take any thing which is tart or sharpe, as chiefly Pepper being beaten small, and drinke Wine vpon it, and the same cometh afterwards into the plights of the stomacke, then will the Hickough be caused through the heate thereof, and the stomacke séeketh through the Hickough to expell the same Wine againe. But by reason that this is caused through inward occasions, then doth it oftentimes happen through the stomack only, and through other infected members, to wit, through impostumes of the head, of falles, and blowes, through breach of the Skull, and impostumation of the Liuer, as when the same is ouerheated, that it sendeth sharpe, pricking and sowre humors towards the stomacke, or that the same runne thitherwards from other parts. If so be that this Hickough do onely procéede of the stomacke, then cometh it of tough cold, or heate, and biting humors, whereby some bad impostumes, or exulcerations be prouo∣ked. Item, this Hickough is also caused through great emptinesse or inanition of the stomack, which commeth through lingring Agues, long abstinence, great labour, much purging, conti∣nuall laskes, and much parbraking. But if so be that it commeth suddenly vpon one without any long precedent sicknesse, and that a bodie find himselfe well before meate, and after meate ill at ease if he haue well eaten and drunken, and thereupon do rest a long time, then it is a sure signe that this Hickough procéedeth of the fulnes of the stomack. But if they be cold or tough humors which prouoke this Hickough, then are all warme things very welcome to the pati∣ent, and he féeleth alwaies some kind of cold in the stomacke. Or if it be caused through heate, then desireth he all cold things, and feeleth alwaies a gnawing paine in the stomacke. With the impostumes are alwaies Agues, paines, and inappetencie annexed: also the patient after parbraking, and after the laske, féeleth himselfe somewhat lightned: when as then the impo∣stume is broken, that may be perceiued by tart & sowre things that one taketh. All other signes of this seuerall maladie which is outwardly, may be required of the patient himselfe, and of such as stand by. In like manner, if the breath sauour, then is it a signe of some kind of foule stinking humor or meate which putrifieth in the stomacke. If it come through cold of the sto∣macke, that may be knowne through féeling, and all that is cold is preiudiciall vnto him, and all warme things be acceptable. Or if this Hickough be caused through repletion and fulnes, with anguishes, straines, and with many belchings, then may it be perceiued what humors they be, by the swéetnesse, bitternesse, and saltnesse. Of the Hickough through repletion, and winds. WHen as then the Hickough cometh on any bodie, after that he hath eaten grosse meate and hath drunken, then it is certaine enough, that it is caused through reple∣tion of the stomacke, through coldnes of the matter, and of winds, which the Gre∣cians do call Empneumatosin, which is a distention. For this, the stomacke is first to be vnburthe∣ned through vomiting, and to induce his bodie through loosenes; for which, there is to be taken Hiera picra, Rubarbe, and Agaricus. And if so be that these mild things will not helpe, then are you to vse these pretious pils following: Take burnt Iuorie, séedes of Endiue, of Purslaine, and Lignum Aloes, of each one dragme and a halfe, sowre Dates halfe an ounce, Rubarbe one ounce, this being beaten all small, and if so be that you will, then put Vineger vnto it, or the sirupe of Mints. Or if you had rather haue the same soft like a sirupe, then take so much the more Vineger, or sirupe with it, and take euery day halfe an ounce of it. For this is also commodious the conserues of Bayberries, de baccis Lauri: so is also the con∣fection Diacyminum, Diatrion pipereon, bare, and confected Annis seeds, confected Ginger, Comin, Caraway, Galingall, Mints, Ameos, Masticke, Cloues, Frankinsence, Marioram, and field Mints, through all which things, Powders, Confections, Conserues and all that one will, and may be made. You haue also certaine good things in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, and 17. §. which be very good for this vse. But aboue all, Cloues are very good for to strengthen the stomacke, and to consume all bad humors, which cause this Hickough. The sirupe of Mints is also highly commended for this purpose. This Confection following may also be prepared: Take Spica, Squinant, Calmus, Annis,
Fennell, Mints, Wormewood, and Costus, of each one dragme, Saffron, Lignum Aloes, and Cloues, of each two scruples, Mastick and Roses, of each one dragme and a halfe, Opium, prepa∣red Coriander, white Poppie seede, Cassie wood, of each halfe a dragme, the Muscilage of Flea∣wort, as much as will suffise for to make losinges with: but they be more meet and pleasant, if they be made with Sugar, taking to euery ounce of powder twelue ounces of Sugar, if one will make Sugar losinges with it. If so be that then the Hickcough plague one too sore, then take Spec. Dialangae one dragme, Philonium halfe a dragme, temper it, and take it with Wine in the morning. This following is to be drunken: Take Comin, white Mints, of each a like quantitie, and a little Frankinsence; seethe it in water, and drinke of it oftentimes warme, it expelleth the wind and cold matter of the stomacke. Item, the same doth also the water of Rue, being drunken fasting, or prepare this Wine following: Take Diptamum beaten small halfe an ounce, Treacle one dragme, temper them together with one ounce of wine. For his meate, all common Venison, and all kind of Birds, as Pullets and Pigeons, &c. be very fit, but they be alwaies better rosted then sodden. And all that he eateth boyled, is to be drest or stued with Spices. But if all the foresaid things will not yet driue away the Hickcough, then is there to be gi∣uen to the patient Trociscos de Olibano fiue dragmes, Elecampane rootes thrée dragmes, dryed Rosemary, and Rue, of each one quarter of an ounce, séede of Mints, or the herbe, thrée dragms and a halfe, make thereof Trocisks with sirupe of Mints, and giue thereof one dragme and a halfe at once. Other do commend this following: Take Costus rootes, Saffron, Roses, Masticke, & Spica, of each one quarter of an ounce, Asarabacca one dragme, Aloe, Opium, of each halfe a dragme, make also Trociscos of it with the muscilage of Fleawoort, and giue him one dragme thereof. These Trocisci are to be taken alone when the Hickcough shall get the maisterie. Outwardly are these things to be vsed: Take the decoction of Comin, white Mints, and Frankinsence, (like as is sayd for the drinke) make a sponge wet in it, and being wroong out, lay it oftentimes warme vpon the stomacke. Aqua vitae is also commodious for this, Vitall wa∣ter, Oyles, and other things, like as is described before in the paine of the stomacke. In like manner one may foment the place with warme water of Rue, or that which is more forcible must the same be well rubbed with, as is before rehearsed. Item, there may moreouer be taken for this purpose, dry Wormwood, Mints, and Comin, powned together, sewed in a bag, and so laid vpon the stomacke. Also the stomacke must be an∣nointed with warme oyle, to wit, oyle of Wormwood, Masticke and such like, and then to weare ouer it this plaister following: Take Frankinsence, Mastick, Wormwood, and Mints, of each halfe an ounce, Laudanum one ounce and a halfe, Annis, Fennell, Cloues, and Spica, of each one dragme, make a plaister of them with Waxe, for to be laid vpon the stomacke. Also regard is to be had vnto the patient that he incline himselfe as much as is possible to sléeping, and fasting. And if so be that he be somewhat leane, then is he to bathe otherwhiles, for that the same consumeth the cold matter which doth cause the Hickcough. Of the Hickough, caused through emptinesse and inanition. IF so be that this Hickcough do come after an Ague, by the disquietnesse, vomiting, thirst, and drouth of the mouth, then is the patient to take oftentimes a little warme water: and if so be that the Hickcough will not thereby auoid and tary away, then is he to take Barly water, with oyle of swéete Almonds. For this is also requisite Barly pap made with milke: also warme milke as it commeth from the Cow, Pullet broth, rere sodden Egs, Wine which is not too strong: the muscilage of Fleawoort with the Iulep, and the iuice of Pomegranats being drunken, is also good for this intent. Also annoynt the backbone from aboue till beneath, or rather the whole bodie with Salla oyle, or oyle of Roses. Boxing cups set vpon the stomacke, and behind vpon the back, be much commended for this disease: also the rubbing of all the outward members. Lastly, we are to thinke vpon the yong children, who were wont to be vexed much with
the Hickcough. In case they be still nourished at the brest, and do not digest well, through any piercing cold, or that their milke doth come to curd in the stomacke, then are they to vse none other medicine, but that their stomacke be annoynted with this oyle following, tempered toge∣ther, or each alone, and then to lay a warme cloth vpon it, to wit, oyle of Masticke, of Worm∣wood, of Dill, and Beuercod, and that the nurse, which giueth sucke, do eate light meates. Of vnsatiable hunger in generall. §. 35. OF all other accidents of the stomacke, there commeth also an insatiable hunger, which the learned do deuide into foure parts, and some into fiue, which parts are comprehended in the first, and so we will also let it rest. The first, the Greeks do cal Cynorexian, the Latinists Caninum, which is Dogs hunger. The second Bulimos, some haue alleaged this for Dogs hunger, which we also estéeme to be the same. The third is, Syncopalis, which bringeth swouning with it. The last is, the lost or spoiled hunger, whereof we now intend to write. Of the Dogs hunger, or the vnsatiable appetite of meate. THis hunger is (as is said) an vnnaturall lust or desire of meate, and hath his name of the Dog an vnsatiable beast, and so greedie in eating, that he must cast it out againe, and séeketh immediatly to fill himselfe againe. All such manner of hunger may also come vnto men, and that as well through cold, as through heate, of the ayre, hard running, great la∣bour, long watching, forcible Agues, great lasks, or wormes of the stomacke or bowels, which consume the meate. In like manner also of any kind of humors, which do fall into the stomack and there enfeeble the retentiue vertue, and do driue downe the meate oftentimes with vehe∣mencie, or that the expulsiue force be too extreame strong. This maladie commeth commonly after a feruent Ague, and much vomiting. It doth also happen through ouermuch heate of the stomacke that is long continuing, whereby it digesteth much, and alwaies desireth more. The other principall occasion is cold, which sticketh fast in the mouth of the stomacke, wherof com∣meth also an vnnaturall desire of meate. And how much greater that the cold is, so much the greater is the hunger, and that so long, vntill all the vertues of it be weakened. The third occa∣sion may be some sowre humor, or of Phlegma and Melancholia, which may be retained in the mouth of the stomacke, and doth there prouoke this lust and desire of meate. The signes of this vnnaturall hunger, which is caused through warmth of the time, through great labor, and such like, are discouered before, also through vnnaturall cold, much watching, &c. and all other out∣ward accidents, which are to be demaunded of the patient himselfe. Or if this disease be caused through wormes, such hath likewise his sure signes, which be mentioned in their place. If so be that this hunger then do procéede onely through heate of the stomacke, or through heate of the whole bodie, then is there great thirst with it. And if it be caused through any hu∣mors, debilitie of the retentiue, or vehemencie of the expulsiue vertues, it may be to be séene by the meate, that auoideth vndigested through the stoole. But if this disease be caused through melancholy, then is there with it a pricking, or gnaw∣ing, with a drouth of the mouth, the patient sléepeth but little, and that with terrible dreames, and hath ill fantasies in his head. When as then this maladie cometh through cold, then doth the patient alwaies féele himselfe troubled after meate, and he must by and by vomit vp the same againe, or the same passeth from him downewards vndigested. Present regard is to be had, that the body be not filled ful of bad humors, wherby the Consumption might at last ensue, and Lieuteria, yea the Dropsie it selfe. And if this should so continue a certain time, then follow∣eth at last Bulimos, and afterwards Syncopalis, (whereof we haue spoken before) which taketh people out of the world. If so be then this vnnaturall hunger be caused through any outward or accidentall occasion, the same are to be preuented with contrarie remedies, to wit, with alte∣ration of cold dwellings into warme; of great labour, into rest and sléepe, &c. In case then that this hunger be caused through coldnes of the stomack, then are warme things for purging, and other warme remedies to be vsed, which might expell the cold matter from the stomack, wherof we haue written herebefore in the 5. §. and of all that strengtheneth the stomacke. For this, it
is also required by all the learned, that these kinds of patients should eate boyled Rice, with the fat of Mutton stued, or that is dropt off from rost meate. All fat things moderatly vsed are ve∣ry good for him; as Sallad oyle, and such like. But if this maladie do come through cold sowre Phlegma then it is good that he boyle Marioram in all his meates. He may also vse Mustard, Honie, Nuts, Almonds, Onions and Garlicke; he may also the space of certaine dayes eate Goates milke, with the oyle of Violets, because that these fat meats do driue aboue in the sto∣mack, therfore they do supple the mouth of the stomack, and do make a lothsomnes to feeding. The second: It is then passing good, that such do drinke much old and strong red wine at their meales, which is also very good to slake hunger with. Also for this Dogges hunger, are warme Confections to be vsed; as namely, Letitiae Galeni, Diapliris cum Moscu, Diatrionpipereon, Triphera magna, good confects, Ginger, Hippocras, and other spiced wines moe, made sweete rather with Honie than with Sugar. But this is not spoken of the hunger which commeth through long fasting, of great scouring of the bloudie flixe, or of strong purgations; but onely of this vnsatiable hunger which is called Dogs hunger. If so be then euery such patient shall obserue this decréed order, then will this hunger abate very much, and also be thoroughly cured in time. But in case that this hunger procéed of heate, and the meate do not molest him, neither yet is cast out aboue nor beneath (like as it was wont to be) if after a lingring sicknesse, he were ouercharged with meate, and if the stomack and all the whole bodie be waxen hote, they are to be fed with meates which be not easie to be digested: as namely, old Béefe, Mutton, Porke, and also all kind of pottages, of Pease and Beanes, of Rice and Wheate boyled in milke, great fishes, Tripes, féete and Liuers of all beasts; also hatd sodden Egs: and in fine, with all that is hard of digestion, which lyeth long in the stomacke, and wherewith the stomacke may be cloyed. Also his meates ought to be drest with some cold things: for which Melons, Cucum∣bers, and Gourds be very good. He is to kéepe himselfe also in the cold ayre. His drinke must be alwaies good Claret wine. And for a conclusion, he must eschue all spice and strong wines. But if so be the stomacke be too much ouercharged, and too much burthened, then is the patient to be forced to vomit, through such meanes as be herebefore oftentimes expressed. The stomacke is outwardly to be annointed with cold oyles, likewise also with vnguent of Roses, with the cooling salue Galeni, with the white Camfere salue, with Vineger and Rose∣water, wherein is a litle Allume dissolued. And if so be that the same be not any thing which hindreth it, then let the patient bathe in cold water. And if so be that this hunger be caused through melancholy, then prepare this sirupe following: Take the rootes of Sperage, Fennell, Parsly, Smallage, Butchers broome, Thyme, Comin, Burrage, Buglosse, Harts tongue, Rai∣sins, the stones taken out, flowers of Burrage, and of Buglosse, of each halfe an ounce, Fumi∣torie halfe a handfull, Hony eightéene ounces: make a sirupe of them, and giue him each time one ounce and a halfe, or two ounces. For to purge vse the Confection of Sene leaues, or this potion following: Take Sene leaues, Polypody roots, & Annis, of each half an ounce, Currans one ounce; let them seeth together in eight ounces of water vnto the halfe, then temper therein beaten Epithymum one quarter of an ounce, Sene powder, and prepared Agaricus, of each halfe a dragme, Cloues halfe a scruple, make thereof a potion: And if neede be, open the Saluatella, vpon the right hand. He is also to be ordered in his diet, as is before rehearsed, and all things are to be forborne which may prouoke appetite, as hath bene shewed before in the 9. §. It is also said, that hard rosted Egs after other meate, be very méet for this purpose. And it happe∣neth also very well (like as is briefly spoken of before) that if one recouer after a long continued sicknesse, that there doth follow a very great hunger: but they are to haue no hard or grosse meates giuen them; as Béefe, great fishes, vnleauened bread, or such like, because that their digestion is as yet very féeble, whereby they might easily fall againe into a new disease: but then are they to be kept with subtill meates; as with fat Pullets, Capons, Fowles, Butter, and such like, and all vnnatural and vnmeasurable eating is to be withstood and repugned as much as is possible. Of the Cow hunger which is called Bulimos. THis vnnaturall and insatiable hunger Bulimos, is as much to say with the Grecians, as a very great hunger: which name, the successors haue somewhat altered, and haue
made thereof Bulismos. And it is thus described: Bulimos, which is a hunger of the members, whereby the stomacke is satisfied. And this is also a great disease of the stomacke, which taketh his beginning from the stomack it selfe. But it is contrarie to Dogs hunger in these things fol∣lowing: to wit, although they haue both of them an insatiable lust and desire of meate, yet with the Dogs hunger is not onely a desire, but also the feeding it selfe: but in the Cow hunger, it chaunceth that the patient who hath lately eaten, is moued immediatly to eate againe, where neuertheles all lust to eate, and to cast it vp, is taken away. But there is no such hunger in the stomack, which is to be satisfied with a bit; but in the inward parts which be desirous of meate without interceasing: and when the stomacke is against her will ouerburdened and cloyed, then will it be ouermuch disordered, and out of quiet or square, for to discharge her dutie of digestion. Secondly, in the Dogs hunger the vertues of the stomacke and other parts be for a while strong and able: but in this Cow hunger are they withered and weake. And because that such sicknesse is caused as well through heate as through cold; therefore must we seuerally write thereof. The greatest occasion of this Bulimia, is, when winter time is, the stomack is cooled too much with cold, then driueth the humors towards the stomacke, out of the veines, in the inward parts, filling them therwith, spoiling the appetite, and also depriuing the stomacke therewith of all her force and vigor: in the meane while the other parts remaine emptie and hungry, de∣siring much their foode and sustenance. Hence then this insatiable hunger doth procéede: so that this is properly an hunger of the members, and is no hunger at all of the stomacke. If so be that then any one, as is said, be so extreamely cooled, and although there come such a lust of feeding vpon him, yet it is very quickly slaked. This disease bringeth otherwhile such a quaume with it, that the patient is caused to cast out some tough slime or corruption: and then will all out∣ward members (which be defrauded of their nourishment) be enfeeled, impotent, ouer cold, and the pulse very small. The sicke person hath soure belchings from the stomacke, and a fowle smatch in the mouth. The vrine is bleake, likewise the ordure blacke coloured, thin, and also otherwhiles hard, because that the patient can eate very litle, or nothing at al. Now then, whe∣ther this disease be caused or not, through great cold of Winter time, or cold slime of the sto∣macke, the patient is certaine dayes together, to take morning & euening a draught of Oxymel Compositum, or of Squils, with water wherein Galingale is decocted: afterwards he is to vo∣mit and purge with Mirobalani Chebuli, Bellirici, and Emblici The like also with the pils Foetidae, stomachicae, or with these following: Take Turbith, Agaricus, of each one dragme, Spica and Ginger, of each one dragme: temper them together, and take one dragme of it at once, and after∣wards he is to vse this confection following, namely, Diamoschu, Diambra, Trionpipereon, Diacy∣mino, Diagalanga, and that especially after purging. All his meate must be also drest and strewed with spice, and also be rather alwaies rosted then boyled. Rue water drunken is also very ne∣cessarie, but chiefly good old wine, which is somewhat binding by nature. Before dinner and supper, the stomacke is to be well annoynted with the oyle of Masticke and of Spike tempered together. Also to bath in water, wherin Wormwood, Melilot, Cammo∣mill, and Butchers broome hath bene decocted. What is more to be vsed for this, looke in the same Chapter, in the 5. §. which remedies be most fit for it. These kind of patients are also to be sprinkled oftentimes with Rose water, or faire Well water vpon their bodies and their faces, that the naturall heate may be driuen in∣ward, and the inward members may be strengthened. They are also to hold oftentimes spice before their noses, and to vse it in their meate. His wine must be alwaies strengthened and ena∣bled with Cinnamom, Pepper, Cloues, and with Spica, and with them and with vineger is he to sprinkle a hote stone, and to receiue the vapor of it. The chamber is to be fumed with Lignum Aloes, or with Muscus, Ambra, blacke and white Frankinsence, Laudanum, Masticke, Galingale, with Citron péeles and Orange peeles, Gallia and Alipta Muscata, with each alone, or with which you please. But if this disease come through heate, then is this vnnaturall hunger of the members cau∣sed of the resolued humors of the veines & other members which passe into the stomacke, and there oppresse the stomacke, with lothsomnes and irksomnesse of feeding. But they are to wash their mouth very often with a litle Oxysacchara, or with veriuice. Likewise also to vse Iulep of Roses, with a litle Camfere, or sirupe of Roses mixt with Saunders. For this is also meete all
cooling things, and especially them that haue a binding operation, whereof there be many dis∣couered in the same Chapter, and the 6. §. Afterwards, the patient is to be purged with Mirobalans, with Rubarbe, or sowre Dates stewed in the decoction of Prunes, as also with Hiera Picra, or sirupe of vineger tempered with the said decoction. Afterwards he shall vse the confection Rosata Nouella, or Triasantalon. His meate must be drest with veriuice, and with Butchers broome séedes, and strewed with odori∣ferous cooling things. For his drinke he is to take good cleare wine delayed meetly well with water. It is also good for this patient, that he bath in water wherein Roses, Mirtle séede, and En∣diue be decocted, and afterwards annoint the stomacke euen to the nauell with the oyle of Mir∣tle, and oyle of Roses, wherein is a little vineger tempered. In like manner may he irrigate the members from on high with Rosewater, or cold Well water. Of the swouning Hunger called Syncopalis. THe third vnnaturall hunger hath his name (as is said) of the swouning which it bringeth with it: and the same commeth commonly after the first described Bulimo, or such like sicknesse, for that the naturall powers are very faint and debilitated. Also because this hunger is so neare vnto the hart, that it cannot tolerate such debilitie, euen as it hath bene here before sufficiently taught. Also in respect herof, for that some haue so weake and so tender a mouth of the stomake, that they cannot abide any fasting: but when they begin to be hungrie, and may not by and by haue foode, do fall presently into a swoune. When this happeneth, then are the outward members to be rubbed hard, and bounden with paine, and the face sprinkled with Rosewater, or washed and quickened with other things which be mentio∣ned in the second part, the sixt Chapter and 2. §. But if so be that his force be not quite spent, or if one perceiue that the swouning will come vpon him, then giue him a bit of bread to eate stée∣ped in wine. The fourth is a corrupted or bad hunger. But because this hunger for the most part happe∣neth to women with child: therefore we will not discourse here any further thereof, vntil such time as we shall discourse of this, and other matters moe appertaining to women. In like manner also concerning the wormes, because that they do infect and frequent more the bowels than the stomacke, and are thence expelled: therefore we will discourse of them in the description of the bowels. The twelfth Chapter. Of the Lyuer. ALbeit now the Lyuer haue the seate in the third part of mans body, fast vnder the Midriffe or Diaphragma, about the stomacke, for which cause we continuing our method, ought to haue written thereof before the sto∣macke: yet we haue declared sufficient causes in the beginning of the tenth Chapter, and shewed for what cause it hath not yet bene effected. This most noble member whereof we are now to discourse, which we call the Lyuer, the Grecians Hepar, and the Latinists Iecur, hath her si∣tuation (as is said) on the one side of the stomacke, which it toucheth in a wonderfull (and yet neuerthelesse in a naturall) manner, with fiue branches, like as it were fiue fingers, wherewith she stretcheth also a litle towards the left side, and is also by nature one of the most needfull and worthiest members which is giuen for the nourishment and sustay∣ning of mans bodie, therefore are all beasts that do blow endued with it. This great and ex∣cellent gift haue the heathen people also acknowledged: but they shamefully & infidelly abuse this wonderfull creature of God in their sacrifices: in which amongst other the entrailes they behold the Lyuer especially, supposing thereby to learne and vnderstand things for to come, euen as they, whether it be through naturall causes, illusions of the diuell, (or through the lea∣sings of their sacrificing priests) haue published and made knowne many kinds of wonderfull
things. The substance of the Liuer is compacted flesh, of a red colour, not much vnlike to con∣gealed bloud, full of veines and arteries, and is of a warme and moyst complexion, like as is also the bloud. Also of her selfe she is without sense or féeling, like to halfe a circle, and in man (in regard of the whole body) she is much bigger then in beasts, and especially in such as ban∣quet euery day, and make good cheare, or be fleshy by nature. The Liuer is the beginning and the seate of all lustes, a fountaine of all the veines, the kitchen of all the bloud, which she after∣wards in most wonderfull manner doth spread abroad, and impart throughout the whole bo∣dy, whereby all the members be nourished, sustained and strengthened. This her admirable o∣peration is not amisse to be compared with must, which hath his lées, that setleth it selfe in the bottome: Also there is then some light with it which ascendeth, that we do call the flowre of the wine: Lastly, there is somewhat more which vaporeth out within the yeare, which is wa∣terish. Euen so fareth it with the Liuer, which draweth first all manner of mixed moisture vnto her, & the greatest & the muddiest: to wit, Melancholia sendeth he towards the Milt or Spleene: that which is light, hote, and fierie, as Cholera is, draweth to the Gall: the excessiue waterish moisture which remaineth still in the rest of the bodie, and all that is not méete for the bloud, that do the Raynes draw to them, from whence the same commeth into the Bladder, and is afterwards voyded out for vrine. This excellent member is (like as the whole body of man) subiect to diuers diseases: amongst which, the most principall are these, namely, when the arteries and veines be obstructed, wher∣of then be caused all kind of sicknesses, as inflammations, schirrosities, lasks, or bloudie flixes, diseases of the Kidneies, and of the conduits of the vrine, thirst, yellow Iaundies, and lastly, di∣uers sorts of Dropsies, whereof we will speake more at large hereafter. Of the infections of the Liuer in generall. §. 1. FIrst, all men that haue any infection of the Liuer, are called Hepatici, notwith∣standing that some do make somewhat else of it, and it is described thus: Hepa∣ticus hath his continuall paine about the place of the Liuer, with swelling, and hardnesse. The face looseth his naturall colour: there is also an Ague, and thirst with it, with drouth of the tongue and the mouth. But this is to be thought a∣gaine vpon, that the Liuer it selfe is vtterly insensible, and therefore féeleth no paine. But this sensiblenes or féeling haue the inward & adiacent Tunicles, and all that belon∣geth vnto them: which paine doth procéede through a cold, or hote Liuer, or some impostuma∣tion, wherof the Phisitions haue their proper signes, which we shal declare in their conuenient places. But the common people, yea also the vnlearned Phisitions do not know so quickly the sicknesse of the Liuer, and that bicause of her manifold accidents and Symptomata, which be inci∣dent vnto it, whereof we will describe the most néedfull, with all their necessarie remedies. Of the obstruction of the Liuer in generall. §. 2. FOrasmuch as the common causes of the obstruction of the Liuer (like as is alreadie dis∣coursed) are in the veines and arteries, and that as well through heate, as through cold: therefore will we first of all make some declaration in generall of this oppilation, before that we come to the principall. This obstruction or oppilation is thus described: Oppilatio is an obstruction, and such a disease, as hindreth the bloud, and other humors, that should haue their passage & course through the veines, which may be prouoked through these causes following in the Liuer: to wit, if a bodie do gird himselfe too hard, and hath his clothes too straight about the Liuer. Item, through fallings, through thrustings, and such like, through vse of grosse meates, as Porke, Béefe, Chéese, vnleauened bread, boyled séeds, as Rice, Wheate, &c. All man∣ner of Pap, & other oppilating Pottages. Item, through outward cold, through inward tough slime and grosse bloud, which hapneth to lye before the orifices of the veines, through winde, impostumes, and through other diseases moe of the Liuer. The common signes next after the forementioned, are these: that alwayes his excrements or ordure is very thin and watrish, the vrine also sheweth thin, cleare, and yellowish. Also there is paine in his right side, and he féeleth a debilitie in the whole bodie, which may best be knowne when one must ascend staires or hils,
and that then the breath is very short, with other signes moe wherof we shall admonish where we shal write of the impostume of the Liuer. Albeit that we shal hereafter make mention of the order of dyet in a hote or cold Liuer, and that we here but in generall do write of the disease of the Liuer, yet will we here notwithstanding briefly rehearse this rule. To wit, that all they that haue any obstruction in the Liuer, are not to eate any thing but light meates, as young Mutton, Hens, and such like, which is often shewed before, and shall be hereafter shewed againe. Also all their meate is to be drest with Parsly roots, and herbs. They are also to vse much Pease porredge. And if this disease proceede of a cold cause, then are you to adde Parsly, Fennell, Southernwood, Sperage, or Capers. His meate must be boyled rather then rosted. Also he must beware of all grosse meates, old flesh, great fishes, & of all fishes which haue no shels. He is to vse no bathes, plaisters, nor any thing else vntill the second digestion be past. All strong motions or exercises immediatly after meate must he eschue. And although he were verie thirstie, yet must he forbeare as much as is possible, and chiefly from drinking of Wine; howbeit neuerthelesse a cleare white and well sauoring Wine is in some sort permit∣ted. This may suffice at this present. The causes of a hote Liuer are many, as namely, the hote time, great labour in the heate of the Sunne, & especially without drinking, excessiue Venerie, application to hote medicines, suf∣focation of the mother or wombe, continuall vse of all hote meates, as Spices, or Wine made with Spices. These are now the signes of a hote Liuer, to wit, a red & yellow vrine, yellow ordure, great thirst, loathing of meate, & a swift pulse. All cold things are acceptable to the patient, & warme things be noysome. He is much enclined to vomiting, and that which he parbraketh is lead co∣loured, and sometimes yellow and gréene. Also the heat of the Liuer may be felt with the hand. They which be of hote nature, and young withall, and in a hote time of the yeare, are most sub∣iect to this disease. And when to this heat there commeth drought, that the mouth & the tongue be dry, then is it well to be séene that this disease procéedeth of an vnnaturall heate, whereby there followeth forthwith Obstrutions, Impostumes, Exulcerations, Tumours, schirrosities of the Liuer, and such like diseases. Of the oppilation or obstruction of the Liuer through heate. §. 3. FOr this obstruction of the Liuer these simples are good: amongst which notwith∣standing some be moderately warme, but they can thereby do no hurt, bicause that they be forcibly deoppilate. They may be mixed with other things, viz. with tame and wild Endiue, small Endiue, Priests crowne, Lyuerwort, Melon seede, Pompeon séede, Gourd séede, Cucumber seede, & Lettice seede, séedes of Purslaine, of Endiue and small Endiue, water of the rootes and herbe of Cicorie, Sorrell, Cicorie, Bur∣rage, Venus haire, small Houseléeke, Harts tongue and field Cypers: of all which, one may pre∣pare what he will. Item, the sirupe of vineger drunken with Endiue water. In like manner may be giuen to the sicke person to drinke Barley water, the iuice of cooling herbes, as of En∣diue, Nightshade and Cuscuta, with the sirupe of Sorrell and Sugar: for that these things do o∣pen the obstructed Liuer, and coole the same. You may also vse for this purpose these things en∣suing: Take Oxysacchara, and sirupe of Violets, of each thrée ounces, sirupe of Endiue twelue ounces, temper them togither, and if you thinke that the choler is tough and thicke, then tem∣per amongst it one ounce of vineger, and vse therof as often as you please each time one ounce & a halfe, with some of the foresayd waters. Or take the sirupe of vineger, the sirupe of Endiue, of each six ounces, & temper them togither. If the body be sore bound, then put therto one ounce of the sirupe of Violets. Or if you thinke that the Cholera be burnt, then put the iuice of Bur∣rage and of Fumitorie vnto it. And if there be any Ague with it (as it commonly doth happen) then is this obstruction not onely commodious, but also most necessarie, that the bad cholerike humours may the easier be expelled: for which these things following are very méete, viz. the sirupe of Diarrhodon, de By∣zantijs, de Radicibus, de Cichorea, taken with the distilled waters méete for them, to wit, water of Venus haire, of Harts tongue, of Agrimony, of Wormewood, of Endiue, of Cicorie, or with the waters wherein the foresayd herbes are decocted.
Item, Cassie with Hiera Picra, Electuarium lenitiuum, Rhabarbarum, Agaricus, sirupe of Roses laxatiue, Pillulae de Rhabarbaro. But seriously to take in hand this matter, it is aboue all workes néedfull to purge, which is thus to be effected. Take the flowers of Burrage, of Buglosse, Violets, Currans, and Endiue séedes, of each halfe an ounce, boyle them togither as behoueth: of this decoction take thrée or fower ounces, and temper therein thrée dragmes of Cassie, sower Dates fiue dragmes, beaten Rubarbe one dragme: these being tempered, take them in the morning early. Sower Dates are especiall good for this, bicause they cleanse the hot Liuer, and also coole it. Or take the flowers of Violets, of Burrage, Prunes, and sower Dates, of each halfe an ounce, Spicanardi one scruple: let them seeth togither in sufficient water. Then take thrée or fower ounces of this decoction, and temper amongst it one ounce of Cassie, and one dragme of Rubarbe steeped in Endiue water: make a drinke of it. If so be that the sicke person be méetely strong, then in steade of the Rubarbe you may temper with it three or fower dragmes of the confection Succo Rosarum. Another: Take sirupe of Violets halfe an ounce, Barly water three ounces, Rubarbe one dragme stéeped in a little Endiue water, Spica thrée dragmes, confection de Succo Rosarum, one quarter of an ounce: temper them togither, and giue it him in the morning betimes. If the humor be grosse, then take in the steade of the Rubarbe, Agaricus and Rubarbe, of each halfe a dragme: for the Agaricus hath an especiall operation in the opening of the obstruction of the Lyuer. For this is also requisite diuers Sirrupes, which be daily vsed at most Apothecaries, and also described in this booke: to wit, aboue all other, both sorts of Oximel, the Oximell of Squils, sirrupe of Endiue, of Barberies, their confections, and all that is made of it, Oxysacchara, sirrupe of Violets, and of Ribes, and principally if there be tempered with Roses, burnt Iuorie, and Saunders. Item, take sirrupe De Bizantijs two ounces, Hony of Roses one ounce, water of Endiue, Fennell, and of Wormewoode, of each two ounces, make a Iulep of it to take at two seuerall times. Another: Take Endiue water six ounces, water of Liuerwort thrée ounces, séedes of Gourdes, Melons, and Cucumbers (slightly beaten with the pils) of each two dragmes, Ve∣nus haire two handfuls, and ten or twelue winter Cherries: let these seeth all togither in suffi∣cient water, vntill that a third part be decocted, & in séething put one quarter of an ounce of red Saunders; afterwards strayne it thorow a cloth, and séeth in the same decoction thrée ounces of Sugar, and then make two Potions of it: they do coole, cleanse, and strengthen the Lyuer, the Kidneys, and all the intrailes maruellous much. Item, take of a gréene Gourd, & set it in an Ouen when the bread is taken out: a good while afterwards make a hole in the bottome, and receiue the water which shall run out vnderneath, then put as much Endiue water vnto it, and make a Iulep of it as you thinke meete. The wine of Pomegranates is very good for this: in like manner also Buttermilke for all diseases of the Lyuer is highly commended. Venus haire one ounce and a halfe or two ounces taken in the morning and euening, cooleth, openeth, and easeth all diseases of the Lyuer. In the moneth of Iune is the water thereof to be distilled. Note also, that whereas there is a great heate of the Lyuer present, there must one refrayne from drinking Wine, and also from all drinks wherein is Hony admixed. But he is to vse all that cooleth. Make also this Iulep following. Take the water of Buglosse, Venus haire, and of Endiue, of each nine ounces, the iuice of Pomegranates two ounces, white Sugar foure ounces and a halfe: seeth all these togither vnto a potion. Or take Iulep of Roses, mixe them with Endiue water, and cleare well water. Although for great heate we haue forbidden Wine, yet neuerthelesse Cherrie wine is per∣mitted, bicause it is of a temperate nature, and doth moysten the Lyuer, and also cooleth, and therefore these patients are to haue otherwhiles at their desire a draught of it. This confection following is also to be vsed, to wit, Triasantali Diarrhodon without spices, conserue of Roses, of Violets, preserued S. Iohns Grapes, or Ribes, Barberies, and Peaches preserued, the conserue of water Lillies doth also coole much. Also the conserue of Cicorie with the rootes, and preser∣ued Grapes, are good for this purpose.
Or haue this confection following prepared: Take péeled Melon seede, Cucumber séede, Gourd seede, & peeled Pompeon seede, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, séedes of Purslaine, of Endiue, and Sorrell, of each one quarter of an ounce, Pine nuts which haue bene stéeped foure howres in Rose water one ounce, Sugar eight ounces, or as much as you please: seeth the Su∣gar with Rose water, and then make loosinges of them. Now for to keepe an open body, these pils are to be prepared: Take one dragme of Rubarb, burnt Iuorie one scruple, make nine pils thereof with the sirrupe of Roses, and take them in togither at one time. Other Pils for the obstruction of the Lyuer caused through Phlegma, which falleth out of the head into the brest and lyuer. If you wil, let the sicke person take these pils two howres before he go to bed: Take pils De Hiera Composia two scruples, and let the sicke person sit the next day in a bath of water. Take also sometimes one dragme of these Trociscis following, to wit, De Berberis, De Cam∣phora, De spoto, and De Sandalis with water of Endiue, and make pils thereof. We will also heere repeate those things which are to be vsed outwardly: Take Roses, red and white Saunders, of each one dragme, Camfere halfe a dragme, beate them all to powder, Vineger foure ounces or more: temper this togither, & wet a cloth therein, and lay it vpon the Lyuer: when it is dry, then make it moyst againe in the same. Or take the iuice of Nightshade and Endiue water, of each thrée ounces, Rose water one ounce and a halfe, Vineger one ounce, red & white Saunders, and the seeds of Citrons beaten, of each one dragme tempered, and vsed as beforesayd. Item, take one quarter of an ounce of strong wine, foure ounces of Nightshade, water one ounce and a halfe, Saffron fiue greynes: mingle them well togither, and then lay it with a cloth ouer the whole Lyuer. Another: Take Endiue water six ounces, Rose water and Night∣shade water, of each three ounces, water of Wormwood two ounces, the iuice of Lettice and of Calmus, of each one ounce and a halfe, red and white Saunders, of each one dragme, Camfere one scruple: temper them well, and then apply it vnto it. Another, which is yet stronger: Take water of Endiue, and of Sorrell, of each six ounces, water of Burrage & of Buglosse, of each foure ounces, Species de gemmis Frigidis thrée dragmes, Diarrhodon, Triasantalon, of each one dragme & a halfe, red Corall halfe a dragme, Camfere one scruple; temper them and vse them as the other. Or take Roses, red and white Saunders, Wormewood, Squinant, burnt Iuorie, and Spi∣ca, of each a like much; beate them all to powder: when as you will vse it, then temper halfe an ounce with Sorrell and Endiue waters, of each foure ounces. Item, take the water of Night∣shade, of Endiue, of Liuerwoort, of Sorrell, and of Wormewood, of each foure ounces, Species Triasantali, Diarrhodon, burnt Iuory, of each halfe a dragme, Saffron one dragme, Vineger two ounces; temper them, and vse them as the other. Another which is temperate: Take water of Buglosse, of Cicory, of Balme, of each six oun∣ces, Spec. de gemmis temperatis one dragme, Saffron one scruple, Vineger one ounce, Malmsey thrée ounces; temper them all togither. But it is to be noted that these cooling things must be vsed with discretion, that they do not coole the breast too much, & prouoke a Cough: the which might easily be procured. Here follow now plaisters and such like. TAke Barly meale thrée ounces, Roses one dragme, white Poppy séede halfe a dragme, the iuice of Wormewood and of Nightshade, of each one ounce and a halfe, Vineger half an ounce; make pap thereof with the oyle of Roses. Or take white Poppy séede one ounce and a halfe, the iuice of Wormewood thrée ounces, the iuice of Nightshade six ounces, Vineger one ounce, and Barley meale as much as sufficeth. This plaister is also highly commended: Take dryed Violets thrée quarters of an ounce, Roses two dragmes and a halfe, Spica and Masticke, of each one dragme and a halfe, Cammo∣mill, Venus haire, Barley meale, Hollihocke roots, of each ten ounces, Squinant, Cipers roots, and Calmus, of each one dragme: make a pap thereof with well water, and lay it euery day ouer the Liuer.
The common plaister of Saunders, which is to be found at the Apothecaries, is also very good for this vse. For a salue: Take oyle of Roses, of water Lillies, and Spica, of each halfe an ounce; Roses, burnt Iuory of each halfe an ounce, red & white Saunders, seeds of Plantaine and of Purslain, of each one dragme, Spica, Agrimony, of each one quarter of an ounce, Masticke two scruples, Waxe as much as is needefull for to make a salue of it. Item, take oyle of Roses two ounces, oyle of Violets and of Spica, of each one ounce, Vineger halfe an ounce, Roses, burnt Iuory, Squinant, red and white Saunders, of each halfe a dragme, Camfere two scruples: then make a salue of it with molten Waxe. The Saunders salue described before in the sixt Chapter, and first §. Also the cooling oynt∣ment, and that of Roses, are maruellous good for this disease. Yet another: Take the oyle of bitter Almonds, and white wine, of each a like quantitie, stéepe Cicorie in it, Wormewood, Cammomill and Agrimonie, and chafe it warme vpon the place of the Liuer. Another which is very forcible. Take the salue of Saunders, and the cooling oyntment Ga∣leni, of each one ounce and a halfe, oyle of Roses one ounce. If it be too soft, then make it as hard as you will with Waxe. It is also necessary to obserue therein an order of dyet. If with this heate of the Liuer there be an Ague, then is he to be kept as one that hath an ague, & that according to the importance of the cause; like as may be discerned in the sixt part. Generally, Lettice, Purslaine, Veriuice and Cucumbers are very good for him, with Vineger, and other meates moe that may be drest with them. And although the inflammation were without an Ague (and yet there be some dry itch and scabs with it) then be the foresayd herbs very wholesome for him. In like maner also Pullets, Hens, Partridges, small birds, Kids, Mutton & Veale drest with Vineger, Veriuice, Orenges or Limons, Barley pap and Oaten pap are also very fit for his meate. The Vineyard Snailes are also very good for them. The fishes that be takē in cleare grauel waters, drest with Parsley and vineger, may he very well eate. Melons, Almonds, Peaches, stued Peares and Apples, Cherries, Strawberries and Raisons, a little of each eaten are also very good. Wine is altogither repugnant to this disease: yet being well watered, or Cherrie wine may he drinke in some respects moderately. Also all grosse meates are very hurtfull for him; as vnleauened bread, grosse flesh, Chéese, Milke, Starch, Rice, and in fine all that bindeth is hurtfull for the li∣uer. But Buttermilke is not ill for this maladie. Of the obstruction in the Liuer through cold. §. 4. IF so be that the oppilation of the Liuer be caused through cold, then is the whole body bleake and lead coloured, and chiefly the face; the toong, the lippes, and the vrine is not coloured: the pulse is slow, there is little thirst, slow digesture, lead coloured and white excrements that stinke not much. All warme things are ve∣ry méete for the patient: but colde things are vtterly against him; first, if this obstruction be without an Ague: but in case that it continue long, then must an Ague ensue by reason that the bloud putrifieth in the Liuer. But if there be any humors with this cold, that is to be perceiued by the thicke water: also by the moisture and thinnesse of the ordure, & by the smal thirst, slow pulse, by the swelling of the eyes and of the face, softnes of the flesh, and loathsome colour, whereby they do come quickly to the yellow Iaundies or Dropsie. With this commeth also oftentimes a laske or scouring, swelling of the eyelids, of the fingers, of the toes, & all outward members. If so be then that these signes chaunce to be or may be per∣ceiued, then may easily be adiudged that this maladie doth procéede through cold causes. The patient is for this, aboue all other things, to be purged, and the flegmaticke matter is to be ex∣pelled: for which this preparatiue sirupe ensuing is to be vsed: Take the rootes of Parslie and of Fennell one ounce and a halfe, the rootes of Smallage one ounce, Agrimonie, Venus haire, and Harts tong, of each one handfull, Mace, Cuscuta, of each two ounces, Licorice, Currans, of each one ounce, white Vineger one ounce, Honie, Sugar, of each six ounces; make a sirupe of them vntill there do remaine about fiftéene ounces, & clarifie it. For this is also good the sirupe of Eupatorio, of Acetosa, Diarrhodon, de Bizantijs, and Acetosus Compositus. Item, take Fennell
roots, the roots of Parsly, of Smallage, Sperage, & Butchers broome, of each halfe an ounce, A∣grimonie one ounce, Annis, Fennell, Cuscuta, of each three dragmes, Harts tong, Venus haire, herbe Bennet, of each a handfull, Vineger one ounce, Sugar as much as you will; and make a sirupe of them. And of one of ye foresaid sirupes you are to vse certaine dayes one after another, euery day two ounces at once. This being effected, then the patient to be purged with this pur∣gation following: Take flowers of Burrage & of Buglosse, of each one ounce and a halfe, Spica one scruple, Agaricus and Polypody rootes, of each halfe a dragme: let them séeth togither, and put vnto it one dragme of Turbith. You are to giue him about foure ounces of this decoction. Or take Pillulas de Agarico, or such like, which purge the flegme. Whē the patient is well pur∣ged, thē is he to vse some of these Trocisks following dissolued in water of Wormwood; to wit, de Rhabarbaro, de Absinthio, and de Eupatorio. Amongst the Confections these are good: Diacostu, Diacalamintha, Dianisum, Diacyminum, Aromaticum rosatum, Diagalanga, Dialacca, and such like. Item, take Pistacia two ounces; stéepe thē two dayes in warme water of Agrimony, chop them afterwards small, and séeth two ounces of Sugar in two ounces of Agrimonie water which is méetely thick. Then temper the Cuscuta, and half an ounce of Cinnamom with it; wherof make losinges: thē take therof morning and euening at least one quarter of an ounce. Hereafter now follow confections and other things which one may eate. Take one pound of well washt Cur∣rans; when they be dried méetely wel, then temper therewith one ounce of beaten Rubarb, and eate therof when you will, a good sponfull at each time, & then kéepe it close stopt. This is very good for all diseases of the Liuer, and chiefly to preuent the yellow Iaundies. Another Confection. Take the muscilage of Hollihock rootes 12. ounces clarified Hony 12. ounces, Licorice 9. dragmes, Betony & Balme, of each thrée drag. Cuscuta, rinds of Tamariske, of each half an ounce, Annis, Couchenel, of each one quarter of an ounce, Ginger one drag. pre∣pared steele two ounces & a halfe, & one dragme of the muscilage of Hollihock roots, & you must seeth the Hony to the thicknesse of Hony: then temper the rest amongst it, and vse it after you haue well stirred your selfe, walked, or run. Annis seeds confected be good for cold obstructions, & all old disease of the Liuer. Item, Comin and Caruway haue great power to heate a frozen Liuer, and to open all her obstructions. Also bitter Almonds confected or otherwise. Likewise, Elecampane roots, Calmus, Eringus, Nutmegs, Walnuts, all of them confected. Item conserue of Eiebright, of Fumitory, of Elderne flowers, Hyssope, Betony, Lauender, Marierom & Sage are altogither very requisite. To all which you may ad Miua Cidoniorum, both Treacles; to wit, the great Diatessaron, and Mithridate, are very commodious for this disease. For the obstruction of the cold in the Liuer be these pils following very good, and especially if there be feare of the dropsie: Take Indy Spica 2. dragmes & a halfe, Spica Romana one drag. Ru∣barb, Agaricus & Ameos, of each one drag. and a half, Cinnamom, Cloues, and Squinant, of each halfe a drag. Aloe 5. drag. make pils thereof with old wine, and vse thereof as often as you wil, one drag. at once. For this obstruction are these things following especiall good: Take Cou∣chenele beaten halfe a drag. make thrée pils thereof with the iuice of Limons; then take them fasting, as you please. Some aduise that there must be tempered amongst it the herbe Cento∣rie, and then make pils of it with the iuice of Agrimonie. Potions and such like. WIne is for this cold obstruction of the Liuer, as in that of heate, not forbidden. For there be sundry wines of herbes ordained for the same, viz. wine of Eiebright, of A∣uence, of Betony, of Harts tong, Marierom, wormewood, Hyssope, and Asarabacca, and such like, which be described in the last part. But if it be néedfull that the wine must be tempered; then prepare a water wherein Annis, Cinamom, Coriander, Fennell rootes, or any of these were decocted, you may also seeth Mal∣lowes and Cuscuta in wine, and sometimes drinke thereof. Of spiced wines are some described before and hereafter, which do serue for the Liuer very well. For which be highly commended Cleretum, Aromatites, and wine of Zeduary. Besides the foresayd sirupes may these ensuing be vsed; to wit, the sirupe of Fumitory, of Wormewood and Mints. And if so be that the Phlegma be very tough, then all the Oxymels are fit for it, vsed with water meete for the purpose.
Of the outward Applications. TAke Agrimonie two handfuls, Cammomill and Venus haire, of each half a handful, Ci∣pers roots, Masticke, Squinant, Spica, of each one dragme, red and white Saunders, Cal∣mus and Wormewood, of each two scruples, burnt Iuory one scruple, muscilage of Hol∣likocke rootes three ounces, oyle of Masticke, Spica, and Barly meale, of each one ounce, and also a little Vineger: then make a plaister of it with the decoction of Agrimonie. The foresayd plaister is good for all hote and cold tumours of the Liuer, and to be vsed at all times, the plaister of Melilot, the plaister of Bay berries, and the knowen gray plaister Diachi∣lon, are all verie good for th is Schirrosity of the stomacke, of the Milt and Liuer. Item, take Ro∣ses fiue drag. Wormewood halfe an ounce, Masticke fiue dragmes, Indie Spica two dragmes & a half, Waxe one ounce, oyle of Roses foure ounces and a halfe: afterwards melt the Waxe and oyle, and wash it with water: lastly, temper all other things beaten amongst it. This plai∣ster strengtheneth, openeth the obstructions of the Liuer and the stomacke, swageth the paine which procéedeth of cold, maketh appetite, and assisteth the digestion. These oyles following are also maruellous good against all Oppilations of the Liuer; to wit, the oyle of Elder, of Bay, of Spike, and of Wormewood, tempered, or each alone, annoynted vpon the place of the Liuer. It hapneth also verie well, that through the obstruction of the Liuer, the intrailes are an∣noyed. For which, you are to take the right sealed earth and temper it with Annis or Fennell, Spica of Indy, with Cinnamom, of each a like quantity, as the cause requireth: vse halfe a drag. of it at once with wine. But of this shall be written more at large where we shall discourse of the guts. In generall, Oxymel is good for all oppilations of the liuer (if there be any sharpnesse of the vrine with it) amongst which, some expert Phisitions do temper these things following, which do take away the sharpnesse of the Vrine: as Annis, wilde yellow Mustard séede, Siluer moun∣taine, Mallowes, Hollihocks, Fleawort, Dragagant, and such like: whereof we shall speake hereafter, to wit, in this third Part. The order of Diet. BEsides all the foresayd remedies, it is necessarie that we do also write what diet this pati∣ent is to obserue. First of all, whatsoeuer cooleth and moisteneth is to be eschewed; to wit, all habitations which lie low by the water: also the South wind. All that here ensueth is hurtfull for him: as Spinage, Beetes, Lettice, Purslaine, Endiue, Gourds, Cucumbers, & Pom∣peons, as also all that is made of dough. Fish also is not good for him, vnlesse it were seldome v∣sed. All slimy parts of beasts is he also to forbeare, as fat Trypes, &c. vnleauened bread, fresh fruits, & all pottages. Notwithstanding, Pease pottage, & broth of Lentils made with Mints, Parsley, Spike, and Galingall be speciall good. He must also refraine from drinking water, if it be not tempered with wine. Also all grosse wine is naught for him. Butter and swines suet is also not much commended. But Sallet oyle is in some respectes permitted. Item, all kinde of milke, and all that is boyled with it, grosse old flesh, and all that bindeth, is also forbidden. For his drinke he is to vse méetely strong wine, which is cleare and of a good taste, and is somewhat swéete. He may also vse otherwhiles good warming aromaticall wine, like as we haue shewed of late. Vineger, Veriuice, Limons and Orenges must he vse with other meates, but alwayes a little, and rather these: The Pomegranates, Cinnamom, Pepper, Ginger, Ga∣lingall, Annis seede, Comin, Fennell, and such like odoriferous things are verie meete for him. In like manner also the herbs and rootes of Parsley, Hyssope, Thyme, Marierom, field Mints, Southernwood, Sage, Basill, Costus rootes, yellow Rapes and all other Turneps drest with oyle he is to vse. In like sort Oliues & Capers. Of all flesh, Hens, Pullets, Doues, Partridges, Fesants, field foules, and sucking Kids, be very good to be eaten: for they may all be drest with spice; and especiall good to be drest with all meates be Parsley and wild Turneps. Some do commend much for this sicknes the Vineyard Snailes, and of all fruits, the bitter and swéete Almonds, Pistacia and Currans.
Of a schirrous Liuer. §. 5. OF this obstruction of the Liuer, it doth otherwhiles waxe schirrous and hard, that one may feele the same with the hand on the out side, without any great trouble to the Liuer: the which maladie the learned do call Scirrum, and the Greekes Schro∣ten. This disease is not to be cured but at the first, for when it is waxed old, then it is too late. These patients do some dye suddenly, and some lingringly; for the Liuer cannot tol∣lerate so strong medicines as the Milt. This disease is to be remedied, as here ensueth. This sicke person is alwayes euerie second day to take one scruple of Ammoniacum, with Oxymel, made into pils. If it shall be néedefull, his liuer veine is to be opened, and afterwards he is to purge with Manna and Rubarb tempered with Agrimonie water: Wormewood wa∣ter is also good. He is certaine dayes afterwards to take one dragme of prepared Wolfs liuer tempered in foure ounces of Agrimony water, & to vse this certaine dayes one after another. It is also good aduise, that this sicke person do vse things which do prouoke much vrine, and do breake the stone in the Bladder, whereof shall good instructions be found in his proper place. For it is consonant to reason, that such things will also resolue and deobstruat the hardnesse of the Liuer. Also he is to drink daily a dragme of the séed of Agnus Castus, tempered with Comin, and Fennell water. Outwardly be the forementioned plaisters, and especially the plaister de Meliloto and Dia∣chilon to be applied vpon it. Also you may make (if you will) a plaister of these things follow∣ing: Take Cammomill one ounce, Roses, marrow of Oxe bones, or of Harts bones, Ducks grease, Hens grease, and oyle of Spike, of each halfe an ounce, beaten Wormewood thrée drag. Fenegreeke, & Linseede meale, of each one ounce, swéete Costus rootes thrée dragmes, and Waxe as much as sufficeth. Or seeth Figs and Raisons, poune them to grout, and temper amongst it Fenegreeke meale, beaten Cammomill, Rue and Melilot: afterwards mingle it with the oyle of Cammomill, as much as will suffice for a salue. Item, take Barly meale two ounces, Cammomil and Melilot, of each halfe a handfull, the muscilage of Hollihock roots fiue ounces, Cypers rootes, Squinant, Mastick, and Spica, of each one quarter of an ounce, red Saunders, Calmus, Agrimonie and Wormewood, of each two scru∣ples, burnt Iuorie one scruple, Saffron halfe a scruple, Vineger halfe an ounce, oyle of Roses one ounce, foure or fiue dry Figs, oyle of Wormewood and of Spike, of each one quarter of an ounce, make a plaister thereof. Some haue taken the venemous herbe Hemlock, and layd it as pap vpon the Liuer: for it doth mollifie schirrositie and hardnesse. By this is also to be vnderstood, that all which is good for the obstruction of the Liuer, is also very méete for this disease. Of a cold Liuer without obstruction. §. 6. THere befall also cold diseases in the Liuer without any obstruction of the same, yet are all the forementioned remedies verie good for this intent, by reason that they do all heate the Liuer and other inward parts: but these Plaisters, Salues, and other things ensuing, are especially ordained for this. Take Mastick, Spica, Cypers rootes, Squinant, Calmus, Saffron and Mirrhe, but the Ma∣stick and Mirrhe are to be dissolued in Wine, then temper the rest amongst it vnto a plaister, and lay it vpon the Lyuer. Item, take the iuice of Agrimonie twelue ounces, Vineger one ounce, Spike and Cinnamome, of each one dragme and a halfe: wet a cloth in it, and lay it also ouer the Liuer. You may also put vnto it foure ounces of Wormewood water. Or take oyle of Quinces, oyle of Mastick halfe an ounce, oyle of Spike one ounce, burnt Iuorie, Roses, Squi∣nant, Cuscuta, Cinnamome and Spike, of each halfe a dragme, Saffron fiue greynes, and Waxe as much as is néedefull. Lastly, stirre a little Vineger amongst it, and with this salue an∣noynt round about and vpon the Liuer twice or thrice a day, that is, vpon the right side, euen to the ribs. Another: Take oyle of Roses halfe an ounce, oyle of Wormewood and of Spike, of each one ounce, red and white Saunders, burnt Iuorie, Squinant and Comin, of each halfe a dragme,
Cinnamome one dragme, Agrimonie and Calmus, of each two scruples, Masticke, and Indie Spica, of each one scruple, Saffron halfe a scruple, Vineger one spoonfull, Waxe as much as is needfull for a salue. But if so be that there do remaine any paine, then may you vse these things following: take Wheatē bread which is well boulted, put it into a bag, and so lay it warme vpon the liuer. But if the paine will not be as yet asswaged with it, then take two parts of Milet, and thrée parts of Bran, and one part of Salt: make them togither warme, and vse it as aforesaid: Or set a great boxing cup vpon the same place. Item: Take Cammomill, Balme, Dill séede, and Annis séede, of each two handfuls, Mace, Fennell, Mallowes, Hollihocke séeds, of each halfe a handfull, and two or thrée Poppie heads; Séeth all these togither in a good deale of water vntill the third part be decocted, and fill a great bladder or twaine with this decoction, and lay it on the place of the paine; and when one is cold, then lay another. Lastly: Take foure ounces of Brand, Venus haire, Dill séede, Burrage séede, and Comin, of each halfe an ounce, Cammomill and Melilot, of each thrée handfuls; Seeth them al togither in white wine, then poune them to grout, and temper therewith one ounce and a halfe of Barly meale, oyle of Cammomill two ounces; then make a plaister of it, and lay it warme vpon it: it is very good to asswage and delay the paine. Of the impostumation of the Liuer. §. 7. THe Liuer may be also annoyed through many kinds of impostumes inwardly or outwardly, which be ingendred of many causes; as through falles, thrusts, or by going too narrow girt, whereby all such issues and impostumes are caused. Also these impostumes may be well caused through some cholerick humour, & through an ouerhot stomacke, through the vse of too much spices, or any other hot meates, whereby the digestion of the stomacke is inféebled and wholly spoiled. For this is especiall good all swéete things, as Honie, Sugar, Figs, &c. But if this moisture be through cold, then doth there come a cleane contrarie cause. The commonest signes of al the impostumes of the Liuer be these; paine in the right side ten∣ding vpwards towards the ribs and shoulder blade, as it were the Pleurifie. The sicke person can hardly lye vpon his sides, & especially on the right side: his face is very blacke, he léeseth ap∣petite his vrin is bloud-red, especially if the impostume be hot: otherwhiles the cough cometh with it, as also the hickcough, parbraking, short breath, retention of vrine, and great thirst. Now for to the cure these impostumes, we will first discourse of them that come through heate: for this is first, the liuer veine to be opened (if the patient be able) and to let out much bloud: but if the partie be weake, then but a little, and then the oftener. If so be that he be hard bound, then be gentle clisters to be ministred, and this thing insuing to be layd vpon the liuer. Take red Saunders, & Roses, of each thrée dragmes, the iuice of En∣diue, and Nightshade, of each two ounces, Rose water one ounce, Vineger halfe an ounce; make them togither luke warme, and then wet clothes therin and apply them vpon the liuer, and re∣new them once euery thrée or foure houres, and continue this thrée or foure dayes. This sirupe following is also to be prepared, which is as well good for the ague, as for to open and loose the body: Take the iuice of small Endiue, of great endiue, of Agrimonie, Smallage, and Fennell, of each thrée ounces, water of Parsley rootes, of Smallage and Venus haire, of each two oun∣ces, cleare wel water twelue ounces, Sugar eightéen ounces, white vineger two ounces: Séeth them al togither, and clarifie them well, then put vnto it Squinant, Spike, burnt Iuorie, Me∣lon séed, Gourd séedes, Cucumber séede, Pompeon séede, and red Saunders, of each one dragme, Wormewood three dragmes; then make a sirupe of it, & take at each time two ounces of it with the decoction of Pease, or with Endiue water. The third day after that such impostumes be knowen, then is the soft pap to be layd vpon it. Take Barly meale, stewed Figs, & Dates bea∣ten to pap, and tempered all togither with oyle or Roses and Vineger. For this sicknesse one must not purge at the first without great néede be. But when the sick∣nes is at the prime or declining, then are you to do the same with Manna, Cassie, sowre Dates, and to exhibite it with the decoction of Violets, Squinant, Prunes, and Wormewood.
In like manner vse loosing meate drest with Burrage, Mallowes, Hops, and such like herbs. But if the impostume be broken out, and that there do come a gentle laske or scouring, where∣with corruption also auoydeth, then is nature to worke. But in case this scouring get the mai∣strie, then is the same to be stayed with the Trociscis de Berberis and de Terrasigillata. But if these impostumes do come of thrusts, or such like occasions, then open a veine (as is sayd already) and lay this plaister following vpon it: Take Mirtle seed, Roses, and Bayberies, of each halfe an ounce, Calmus, Mirrhe, Mastick, of each one quarter of an ounce, Saffron one dragme, oyle of Lillies and Waxe as much as is needefull; and if you feare any hardnes of the Liuer, then vse the mollifying things, whereof we haue spokē in the 5. §. Or make this follow∣ing: Take Cammomill, Melilot, Rue, Wormwood, Ireos, Marierom, Calmus, Hyssop, & Roses, of each one ounce and a halfe, Endiue, Hollyhock rootes, Lineséede, and Fenegréeke, of each one quarter of an ounce: let them boyle all togither in wine and water, make a sponge wet in it, & then lay it warme vpon it. Item, in the declination of the sicknesse is this plaister following to be vsed; Take liquid Storax, and Waxe, of each one ounce and a quarter, Masticke, Saffron, A∣meos, of each half an ounce, oyle of Mastick and of Roses, of each fiue dragmes, Wine six oun∣ces: temper, and vse it warme: the Barly for his meate, & the water for his drinke, is amongst other cooling things verie necessarie meate and drinke. But if so be that these impostumes do proceede of cold, then do they make shew with intumi∣factions and debilities, they bring also rather heauinesse and oppression with them then paine. For this, take héed of letting bloud and strong Clisters: but mild Clisters may be vsed, and also milde purgations. Amongst other is good for these Clisters, Wormewood, Barly, field Mints, Centorie, or which you will, decocted with a little Coloquint. You may also vse well supposi∣tories for to keepe the body soluble, and to draw downe the tough and grosse slime. Prepare also these Trocisks following: Take Roses fiue dragmes, Barberies halfe an ounce, Annis, Smallage seede, Squinant, Cassie wood and Calmus, of each thrée dragmes, Ma∣stick, Spike, Cinnamome, Asarabacca, Rubarb, Mather, and Lacca, of each one dragme: beate them all togither, & make fouresquare Trociskes thereof with the iuice of Fennell the waight of a dragme, and giue thereof one in the euening with this potion following. Take the rootes of Smallage, Parsly, and Fennell, of each one ounce, séedes of Smallage, Annis, Fennell, and Comin, of each halfe an ounce, Squinant, Agrimonie, field Cipers, Ger∣mander, Mather, Cassy wood, and Balsam wood, of each one quarter of an ounce, white Vine∣ger one ounce and a halfe, Hony thréee ounces: séeth them all together in sufficient water, & cla∣rifie it as behoueth. Further, annoint the place with oyle of Spike, oyle of Sesamum, or oyle of the séedes of Manus Christi, and lay this plaister following vpon it. Take the séedes of Smallage, Ameos, Annis, and Cardamome, of each halfe an ounce, Squinant, Aloe, of each thrée dragmes, Spike, Amaranthus, Mastick, Saffron, and Mirtle séed, of each one dragme and a halfe, Turpentine, Rosen, of each three dragmes, Waxe as much as will suffice for to make a plaister with: melt it with a little oile of Spike and of Costus, and then temper the rest amongst it. But if so be that you will you may take and put vnto it Oxe dung, and Goats dung. When the impostume breaketh, that may be perceiued if the patient about the same time fall a shiuering and quaking, with a swouning, and vomiting, and that bloud auoyd both through the stoole and the vrine, then is this plaister following to be vsed; and if peraduenture the opennes be not yet explete, yet doth it ripen and asswage the paine, and strengtheneth the Lyuer. Take Barly meale, & Fenegréeke meale, of each one ounce, Linséede meale three dragmes, Mill dust, Elecampane roots, the roots of Smallage and of Wormewood, of each fiue dragmes, Cammomill, Melilot, Violets, & Roses, of each thrée dragmes, white Lillie roots, Pigeon dung, Spica Romana, of each one dragme, oyle of Cammomill and of Violets, as much as will suffice for to make therewith a plaister: afterwards giue him a drinke for to cleanse him, decocted of Barly and Figs, or let him vse Mellicraton, which is Meade. Of the laske of scouring through weaknesse of the Liuer. §. 8. WE haue sufficiently written thereof before in the eleuenth Chapter, where we haue spoken of all manner sorts of Lasks and bloudy Flixes.
Of diuers things which be very commodious for all infections of the Liuer. §. 9. HEre before in the 3. §. is highly commended the water of Venus haire for all diseases of the Lyuer. For this is also good M. Tristanis water, for it doth pre∣serue and cure the Liuer from all diseases. Item, take the séede of Endiue, of small Endiue, and of Lettice water, of Venus haire, and Liuerwort, red and white Saunders, of each one dragme, seedes of Melons, of Pompeons, and Gourds, of each one quarter of an ounce, shauen Iuorie halfe a dragme, burnt Iuorie one dragme, roots of Fennell, of Parsly, and Smallage, of each one quarter of an ounce, rootes of Endiue three dragmes, and a little Vineger, Sugar one ounce and a halfe: let them seeth all togither in three pints of water vnto the halfe. This is especiall good for a stuft Lyuer which is caused through heate, and also for the yellow Iaundies. Many kindes of golden waters and vitall waters be also good for this, and especially for cold causes. Looke also in the first part, the 12. Chapter, and 1. § where you haue a very good powder, be∣ginning thus: Take the iuice of Wormewood, &c. mixe it with Sugar, and vse it ten dayes to∣gither, it helpeth all maladies of the Milt and Lyuer, it preserueth also from the yellow Iaun∣dies and Dropsie. Of the thirst, through drouth and heate of the Lyuer. §. 10. ALthough the thirst be a common drouth of the inward members, yet neuerthe∣lesse it is caused (for the most part) from the Lyuer, which also dryeth away through the heat, or if the body be burthened with any sicknesse or Ague, which verily is such an intolerable trouble that it excéedeth all other, like as may be seene by the wretched people that be set on a whéele, who do more complaine of thirst, then of their disioynting & broken bones: which thirst is thus described. Thirst, is a desire of cooling and moysture, which is quenched with drinking. The learned do also make three kindes of differences of the thirst: the first do they take for the thirst which is gone cleane, when one hath lost his thirst, and when he is afrayd of drinking. The second is the diminished thirst, when one drinketh seldome. The third is the spoyled thirst, like as when any body desireth out of measure any vnaccu∣stomed and hurtfull drinke without measure: to wit, if one would drinke puddle water, vrine, or such like. This thirst is to be likened vnto the strange lust after meate, which is caused through a bad stomacke, which hath beene spoken of in his place. The causes whence this vnnaturall lust ariseth are many, as great labour, long conuersing in the Sunne & about the fire, a strong Ague through drinking of strong wine, through eating of salt and smoke dried flesh, of Fish, Cheese, Pepper, Ginger, Cloues, and other Spices: sorrow and anger do also extenuate the body, and increase thirst: the like also do hote venims cause. Item if any inward parts be ouer heated (like as hath béene sayd before) in the 3. §. hereby the thirst is also prouoked: and especially the thirst is thē great about measure in the disease of the kidness, which is called Diabetes, and when one goeth ouermuch to the stoole. It happeneth also that some that haue had great thirst, would tollerate the same without drinking, and are fallen into such thirst which could not afterwardes be quenched, and haue fallen thereby into Phthism, Hecticam, and other consuming sicknesses. The same signes and differences of all these causes may be demaunded of the patient him∣selfe, or the standers by. The inward causes doth euery inward part yéeld, as the Lyuer, Hart, Lights, and the Midriffe, sufficiently of it selfe to vnderstand. For this thirst are applyed certaine common rules, which may be well marked, First, how that if one haue a moyst body or stomacke, to him is the thirst profitable; for if he refraine the same, then is the moysture of his body thereby consumed. Secondly, if the thirst be by reason that one hath dronken ouermuch Wine, then is ye thirstie person to endeuour himselfe to much sléeping, and that will quench the thirst. Thirdly, a body is thirstie because he is dry by nature,
and then he is to quēch his thirst through drinking. Fourthly, healthfull folks that haue thirst anights, are to be weaned from drinking. Fiftly, healthfull folks who haue thirst anights, are to be weaned from their drinking anights. Sixtly, if so be that one haue gotten an vnnaturall thirst through eating ouermuch hote meates, he must quench his thirst by drinking water. Se∣uenthly, the thirst which proceedeth of a hote hart and lights, is to be remedied by taking in of fresh ayre, or by receit of any cooling Léekes called Looch, and through much watching, for that drinking much water, and sleeping much, cause more harme then good. Eightly, if the thirst do come onely through drouth of the mouth and the throate, then is he to addict himselfe to sléepe after reasonable drinking, and to forbeare talke. Ninthly, if any body be a thirst after much purging he must not drinke too much, least that the naturall digesture be thereby enfeebled, or that the naturall heate be therewith dissipated and extinguished. Tenthly, all they that haue accustomed to drinke much anights, they do in time spoyle all the humors of the whole body, whereby they do fall at the last into Cacochimian, or the Dropsie, if so be that they do remaine long aliue. But now as concerning the particular remedies of the thirst. The most of them are disco∣uered in all sicknesses that cause thirst. Neuertheles, we cannot here omit to declare in general all that withstandeth thirst. And we will first begin with the potions. Iulep of Roses and of Violets are much vsed in all heates. Iulep of Roses is made thus: Take one pound of Rose water, halfe a pound of white Sugar; séeth them togither by a gentle fire, and clarifie them with the white of an egge, vntill they be as thicke as a sirrupe. This Iu∣lep quencheth all that is of flegmatike Agues, of the Pleurisie, and also of all kind of thirst. In the same manner is the Iulep of Violets to be made, and hath the same operation. It is al∣so good for all rheumes of the breasts, and of the throate, against the cough and the thirst. Item, take fresh Well water, or decocted Barley water tempered with Iulep of Roses or Vio∣lets, and the like also with the iuice of Pomegranates. The same doth likewise quench the thirst very much. These distilled waters following do also quench the thirst very much: viz. the water of En∣diue, of Buglosse, of Sorrell, and such like, wherewith a little Sugar is decocted. It is also sayd that the Cherrie wine is of a temperate nature, therefore doth it quench the thirst in great heate, it cooleth and moysteneth all the inward parts. Item, Meade doth also quench thirst, like as the same is to be seene in the last part of this booke. If so be that you desire also in quenching of the thirst, to loose and make soluble, then take thrée or foure ounces of En∣diue water, and with this water draw as much Cassia out of the canes as you thinke good, and so drink it. It doth quench the thirst maruellous much, like as is also shewed sufficiently in the description of Cassia in the Introduction. These sirrupes following which be here and there described, may also very well be vsed for great thirsts: as sirrupes of Violets, of Vineger, of Citrons, of swéet and sower Pomegranats, & especially the laxatiue sirupe of Roses. For hote Agues you may also vse the sirupe of Oran∣ges, of Barberies, of Cherries, of Prunes, and the iuice of them all. The same confected, dryed, and all that may be made of them. There be also many things moe ministred against the thirst: as fresh Cucumbers, Gourdes and Pompeons; the same being eaten or the iuice dronken. For this is also Lettice good, being eaten with vineger and oyle. Item, blacke Cherries, S. Iohns grapes, and Barberies. The confection of Prunes described before in the eleuenth Chapter, 20. §. is also good and certain for the thirst. Item, confected Peaches, conserue of Roses, of Violets, and of water Lillies. A peece of Sugar dipt in water, and suckt in the mouth asswageth also thirst. Vnripe Grapes chewed & contained in the mouth do the same. Likewise, soure Grapes held long in the mouth, do quench thirst also. Or, if the same be brused into ones drinke: like as is more amplyer ad∣monished in the beginning of this Booke. Of the yellow Iaundies, a sicknesse of the Liuer. §. 11. THis sickensse is called of the Grecians, and of all learned for the most part, Icteros, and in Latin Morbùs regius, Arquatus, Aurigo, Suffusio fellis, and of many Icteria. This is such a sicknesse, whereby that the Cholera or Gall doth spread it selfe very yellow ouer all the
body, and appeareth with other spots or staines. Therqfore is this first to be noted, that there be three kinds of Icters, or Iaundies, the yellow, the gréene, and the blacke. The yellow is caused through yellow Cholera, the gréene out of light gréene Cholera, and both proceede from the Liuer; but the black is caused through black melancholick bloud of some disease of the Milt: albeit the same may also be caused of the Liuer. The causes of these sicknesses are taken to be sundry, and especially of the yellow and greene Iaundies, as of the hot season, by great la∣bour or great exercise, great heat, biting of venemous beasts, the vse of much heate, sweete & fat meats, and inward impostumes. Al which causes do so obstruct the Liuer, that such matter (like as behooueth) cannot be conueyed into the follicle of the Gall whereby it is inflamed: which the obstruction and heat may and doth come to passe in the veines and in all parts of the bo∣dy whereby the bloud is spoyled and conuerted into a greene or yellow colour. The cause of the blacke Isteria, is an obstruction in the Conduits of the Liuer to the Milt, or in the conduits of the milt to the stomacke, a feeblenesse of the expulsiue or attractiue vertue be it of the milt or the liuer. Item, through the vse of much melancholicke meate. In fine, it may also be caused through great heate of the whole body which enflameth the bloud, or through great cold that doth congeale the bloud, and maketh it blacke. The first two signes are abating of the liuely colour, yellownesse in the white of the eyes, & ouer the whole body and of the vrine, the pulse is feeble, the patient thirstie, léeseth appetite, his meates will be bitter, and readie to vomit. Item, if the patient be also yong, cholericke of na∣ture, hath done great labour, and eaten much hot meate, then do they altogither confirme that it is a perfect Icteritia. The blacke Icteritia is to be knowne by her black spots. The Milt is com∣monly hard. This sicknes is then short beneath. The vrine is browne, ruddy, and a slime in the bottome. The sicke person is alwayes heauie and fearefull without cause, like as all melancho∣licke persons are wont to be. Thus then to speake briefly of this yellow Iaundies; they do alwayes come with heate and with an Ague, or also without any of them both, therefore we will first speake of the hote Iaundies. Item first of all, if so be that there be an Ague with this sicknesse, then is the sicke person to drinke Barly water with the iuice of Lettice and of Nightshade, for it cooleth vnnaturall heat, whereby the yellow Iaundies is caused. There be also al kind of cooling herbs to be giuen him to eate, as Endiue, Lettice, Sorrell, &c. drest with Veriuice or Pomegranat wine. His drinke must be well watred, thin wine, or common small béere. Héede must also be taken at the first whether it be not néedfull to purge the partie, and if néed require, then is the same to be done in this manner ensuing: Take Cuscuta and Hoarehound, of each one handfull. Endiue water twelue ounces, and as much white Rhenish wine; let them séeth togither vntill two parts re∣maine, then wring it out and take foure ounces of it: temper one ounce of the sirrupe de Bizan∣tijs with it, you may put Sugar to it if you will, and drinke thrée or foure mornings therof one after another. Another, which is more forcible: Take Horehound, Cuscuta, of each two handfuls, Endiue water halfe a pinte, Wine one pinte, let them séeth togither, and hang two dragmes of Ru∣barb in it, wring it often out, then take foure ounces of it, and temper therewith one of these siirupes following, Syrupum de Bizantijs, de Duabus Radicibus, or Oxymel one ounce, and vse them as is before sayd. For to purge you may after the sayd potions vse these cooling medi∣cines: Take common conserues of Prunes and Cassie, of each thrée dragmes, confection of Psyllio two dragmes and one scruple. De Succo Rosarum one dragme and a halfe, temper them togither with thrée ounces of water of Cuscuta, and one ounce of the hony of Roses: or take Hiera Picra thrée quarters of an ounce, Diaphoenicon one quarter of an ounce, sirrupe of Cicho∣rie with Rubarb halfe an ounce, and Endiue water as much as you will. The Rubarb is not ordained for this but by good reason, because it is forcible at the beginning to take away the yellow Iaundies. For this are all medicines good that be described not long ago in the 3. §. for the heate of the Liuer. But if the heat after purging will not yet ceasse, then giue the patient euery day one or one and a halfe of the Trocisks de Camphora, tempered in one ounce of wine, or the confection Tria∣santalon, and Diarrhodon Abbatis, but before the foresayd things be vsed, you must first vse these pils following: Take Earth wormes washt with wine, or burnt to powder in a pot, as much as you please, and put as much Rubarb vnto it or halfe so much, and make pils thereof, giue
one dragme or one dragme and a halfe at once, according to the age of the partie, mixed with Oxymel. Also you may giue this patient of this foresayd pouder one dragme without Rubarbe. It is also an approoued medicine that twentie or thirtie earth woormes be boyled in the water of Sperrage, of smallage, and of Parsley, and to take often a spoonfull of this decoction. Item take of the pouder of burnt earth woormes, rootes of Smallage, and of Parsley, of each a like quan∣titie: giue thereof to women and yong children to each according to his age: it driueth the yel∣low iaundise very forcibly through the veine, and in like manner also the dropsie. For this you haue another in the second part in the third chapter and 7. §. And to returne to purging, if so be that the pils be more acceptable: then take washt Aloe one dragme or fower scruples, and vse it after the foresayd potions which be good and safe. But if so be that the obstruction of the liuer be not opened by it, then is this medicine fol∣lowing to be vsed: Take sirrupe de Bizantijs prepared with Vineger one ounce and a halfe, wa∣ter of Cuscuta, of Harts tong, and of Cicorie, of each one ounce; drinke it certaine times one after another: or take one ounce and a halfe of Oxymel with water of Cuscuta, of Cicorie, and of Buglosse, of each one ounce three mornings togither, and one of the foresayd purgations af∣ter it. The Oxymel is highly commended for this sicknesse. These pils following are verie forcible for to auoide water: take the iuice of wild Cucum∣bers, which is Elaterium, and the iuice of Swines bread, of each one dragme and a halfe, Rapon∣tica one quarter of an ounce, Aloe one dragme, Diagridion one scruple, Pease meale, Cinnamom, Spica, Lignum Aloes, of each halfe a scruple: make pils thereof with the iuice of Smallage, and giue him one dragme at once thereof at the most. Now for to cleanse the head you are to vse these things following which you can get, as the iuice of wild Cucumbers, and of Swines bread, of garden Cresses, Horehound tempered with womans milke and drawne vp thorow the nose, and afterwards to lye downe vpon the backs. These things following do cleanse the grosse Cholera which remaineth still in the head, & doth take away all the yellow iaundise with them. For this are verie necessarie all cooling and pre∣paratiue potions, with sirrupe of Endiue, and of Purslaine tempered togither, and chiefly if any obstruction of the liuer be present; for which this sirrupe following is also verie fit: Take Endiue, small Endiue, Lettice, Cicorie, Melilot, Harts tong, and Venus haire, of each one handfull, twentie or fiue and twentie Prunes, séeds of Melons, of Pompeons, Cucumbers, of Gourds, roots of Cypresse, of Capers, Dragon rootes, of each one dragme; beate them all grosse, and let them séeth togither in six and thirtie ounces of water euen to the halfe. Afterwards séeth in this decoction fower and twentie ounces of Sugar or Hony, and clarifie it vntill there be a sirrupe of it. Another: Take Endiue, Harts tong, and Cicorie, of each a handfull, wild Endiue, and Priest crowne, of each two handfuls, séedes of Melons, Pompeons, Cucumbers, and Gourds, Lacca, Spiknard, Wormwood, and the rootes of Smallage, of each halfe an ounce, burnt Iuorie, red Sanders, of each one dragme and a halfe, Roses one quarter of an ounce, white Vineger thrée dragmes, Sugar twelue ounces; and then make a sirrupe of it. Another: Take Endiue, Harts tong, and Venus haire, of each two handfuls, Fennell séed, Parsley séede, and Cuscuta, of each halfe an ounce, Spicanardi, Spica romana, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar as much as you please; make thereof a sirrupe. For the obstruction of the liuer in the beginning of the 4. §. there is also a confection which is verie fit for this purpose. Of all drinkes which this patient may drinke, there is nothing more méete for this sicknesse then the whaie of milke, whereof he is to drinke euerie morning three weekes togither a good draught at each time: for this whaie doth clense the bloud, & especially if there be mixed with it the iuice of Fumitorie. And the same is also good for all itches & scurffes: Item that the inner∣most skinne of a hens gissard, also a Partridge dried and beaten to pouder; giue him the waight of a dragme thereof in wine or Cicorie water, and let the patient fast fiue howers after it. Ano∣ther: The innermost skinne of a pullets gissard or crop, and the rootes of Auence, of each a like quantitie; seeth them in wine the space that you would seeth an egge, and drinke thereof mor∣ning and euening, and fast an howre vpon it. Item, take fower ounces of Gentian, & Fennell rootes fiue ounces, Smallage rootes two ounces and a halfe, wash the same verie cleane, and cut them in peeces: let them séeth al togither with sufficient water, afterwards wring them wel out through a bag, and then let this decoction boyle vntil it be as thick as hony, then giue
therof two ounces at each time. This medicine is also especiall good for all phlegmatick Agues wherewith the yellow iaundies be mixed. Item, for al dropsies, all paine of the Kidneies, paine of the wombe, for all venome, and it is to be giuen them that haue an Ague with any kinde of cooling water, and when there is no Ague with a little Wine. Some do séeth it also with Su∣gar, the which is best of all. Item, there be moreouer good to drinke for this yellow iaundies the waters of Cicorie, of Sorrel, and of Wormewood, but the iuice of these herbs be much more forcible. These herbs be also decocted togither or each apart, and the decoction dronken warme. Item, the yellow seede of the white Lilie dryed and powdred, and one dragme thereof taken is an especiall thing in this disease. The same vertue hath grated Iuorie. After purging, and the vse of all these foresayd things, then may any outward things be v∣sed whereby to weare away the yellownes of the body and to consume it. For this is also much aduised, that all yellow colours are to be fixed before the patients eyes, for nature doth the easier expell the yellownesse out of the bodie. Also, take Endiue water and Rose water, of each foure ounces, red and white Saunders, of each one dragme, temper them, & lay them ouer the Liuer. Item, vse the Saunders salue which before in the sixt Chapter in the end of the first §. is described. Or take a spoonefull of good Honie, and boyle the same in a little pot in hot water, and stirre it well about, then put as much wheaten floure vnto it as you can take vp with two fingers, and temper a good deale of Saffron amongst it, yet more alwayes for an old man then for a young man, spread of it vpon a cloth and lay it vpon the Nauel: when it is then dry, take afresh againe. And you are to continue this certaine daies togither, to wit, when the yellow iaundies be at the chief & highest: but one may not lye longer vpon it then vpon the other. For bathing, take wild Thyme, watercresses, Alehoofe, Iuniper rindes, Elderne floures, let this séeth well togither, and make thereof a sweating bath with hote stones. Item, take Mugwort Marierom, wild Thyme, Iuniper sprigs, of each one handfull, chop them small, and let them séeth in two bags, then lay one vpon the belly, and another behind vpon the raynes, and there∣with let the patient sweate. Also, this Lie following may be vsed for the head. Take Betony, Cammomill, and Sage, of each one handfull, Marierom, Spica Romana, of each halfe a handfull, Sene leaues thrée ounces, Stechas two ounces, chop all small, and séeth them togither in a good deale of water, and make Lie thereof, it will continue good a whole moneth. For this hote yellow Iaundies is good al that which penetrateth, cleanseth, and openeth the Liuer, to wit, Sorrell, Endiue, Nightshade, winter Cherries, Orage, the iuice of Wormewood, Venus haire, roots of Cicorie and Sperage, Verueine, and the water of the same herbs decocted in well water, and clarified with Hony or Sugar, and so made into a Potion. And for conclusion of this heate, there is good heede to be taken whether the patient be a∣bounding of bloud, and hath full veines, and also hath not bin let bloud a long time, & so there be nothing which hindreth the same, then is the Liuer veine to be opened, and to let it bléed ac∣cording to his abilitie. But if the yellow Iaundies be without heate and without Ague, then is it a signe that it is caused of Cholera & Phlegma togither: you are first to giue to this sicke per∣son preparatiues, with Syrupo Acetoso composito, or De Byzantijs. He is also to drinke water of Carduus Benedictus with a little Saffron, and afterwards purge with these things following or such like: Take Aloc one dragme, Diagridij fiue greynes, Agaricus two scruples, dryed iuice of Agrimonie one scruple, then make it into pils with the iuice of Endiue, or vse in the stead of it one dragme of the pils of Rubarb. These pils following are not to purge but to open obstructions, Sulphur vif one dragme, the iuice of Swines bred halfe a scruple, Euphorbium fiue greynes, the iuice of Smallage halfe & dragme, make pils thereof, and giue him halfe a dragme of it at once. When he hath pur∣ged, then let him take Trociscos de Lacca, with the decoction of Fennell, Parsly rootes, of Smal∣lage, and such like. For this is also good Troscisci de Rhabarbaro, Radish water, and Agrimony. Item, the iuice of Swines bred made to a sirupe with Sugar, which is found to be special good, and it moueth sweate. In like manner be méete for this the great Treacle Diatessaron, and Mi∣thridate, somtimes one dragme, (taking more or lesse thereof) according to the importance of the case. The simples which are méete for the yellow Iaundies (when there is neither heate
nor Ague with it) be Mather (if one take a dragme thereof euery day.) Item Gentian, rootes of Smallage, of Pennyroyall, Diptamiu, Rosemary, Centorie, Agrimony, Annis, Fennell, Lico∣rice, Rapontica, of Costus, Aristologie. Alehoofe and Piony. The compounded things be conserues of Eybright, of Fumitorie, of Elder floures, Piony and Rosemary. The herbwines, are the wine of Betonie, of Gillyfloures, of Harts tong, of Tamariske, of Asarabacca, and of Worme∣wood. The Oxymel alone openeth all obstructions. But if so be that the yellow Iaundies do re∣maine long in the eyes, then the sick person is to smell often vnto sharpe Vineger, for it prouo∣keth the expulsiue power whereby the braynes may be vnburthened of all their superfluous humours: or receiue the vapor into your eyes of the decoction of Hyssop, Marierom, Mayden haire, Cammomil, Dill, of all them or which you please. You may also wash the face with it. And it is very good to smell vnto Rose water or Rose vineger. Item, you may sometimes drop into their eyes one or two drops of the iuice of Citrons, of Limons, or of Oranges. But if these iuices be too sharpe, then mixe them with the water of Cuscuta, which water alone is ve∣rie effectuall in this matter. Also for the yellow iaundies, whether the same procéede of heat or cold, néesing is highly re∣commended, especially if the same can be procured and effected with the iuice of Horehound. Al∣so all such sicke persons must wash themselues with water wherein Cammomill is decocted, & chiefly at the beginning of the yellow iaundies. The face is often to be washed with Rose wa∣ter, to the end that the yellownesse might the lesse infect the eyes. As much as concerneth the blacke iaundies: the same is to be cured with the selfe same things, wherewith all the maladies of the milt are to be cured, whereof shall be spoken here∣after: to wit with clisters, letting of bloud, and other meanes moe which may there be read. Of the Dropsie in generall. §. 12. THe Dropsie is a sicknesse which is caused of a cold humour that doth penetrate throughout all the members, in such manner that they thereby are all puffed vp and swollen. Or the dropsie is an errour of the nutritiue vertue throughout the whole body: which errour is prouoked by those causes which do hinder the naturall concoction of the liuer. The common signes and right embassadours of the Dropsie are first of all these following: swelling or puffing vp of the féete and the legs, afterwardes of the face (in men of the cods) and a little ouer all the whole body: Secondly, the alteration of the colour of the body into a white colour. Thirdly, when all the humours in the whole body be corrupted: the which the Grecians do call Cacochymian. Fourthly, great thirst. Fiftly, lost appetite through continuall desire of drinke. Sixtly, retention of stooles, of sweate, of vomiting, of the flowers or termes in women, and such like. Seuenthly, small store of vrine. Eightly, that these sicke folkes are verie slow and vnhandsome for all workes. Chanceth it then, (as it is wont to happen) that there be any vlcers or sores with it, then be the same by reason of the corrup∣ted humours which be in this place verie hardly to be healed. And although this sicknesse be very hard and dangerous to be cured: yet neuerthelesse must the sick person not therfore be vt∣terly discouraged. In like manner also the Phisition is through all possible meanes to ende∣uour himselfe to withstand this sicknesse. The totall summe for to rid this sicknesse dependeth on three points; to wit, the mollification of the indurate tumours which be in the bowels and other places: or the vse of all manner of things for to expell the humours. Lastly, he must be di∣ligent to driue out the same by going to stoole, and chiefly through the vrine: So that the princi∣pall meanes consist in this, that one do drinke but little, do liue soberly and orderly, vse reaso∣nable exercise, that one do sweate much, purge often, and vse Clisters: for if all this be not dili∣gently obserued, then is there not much good to be expected. For notwithstanding that all these things be adhibited and permitted: yet be there neuerthelesse very few holpen of it. These com∣mon rules alwayes take place in all sorts of dropsies. The learned do make thrée Species of dropsies, as Anasarca, also Hyposarca, (albeit some do make difference betwéene them, & so make foure kindes of dropsies) Ascites, and Tympania, or Tympanites, of which we will seuerally write hereafter. But first we will then briefly declare thus much.
When as any one is thought to haue gotten the dropsie, or that the same is yet in the be∣ginning, for it, is the conserues of Fumitorie highly commended; for it cleanseth the bloud. For this is also good the golden water which is described in the eight Part. The conserue of Eye∣bright doth open much all obstructions. For this is also very méete all that is ordained herebe∣fore for the obstruction of the Lights and Liuer. Of the Dropsie Anasarca. §. 12. THis spec. of dropsie doth Galen also call Leucophlegmatia Hydrops, as a white wa∣terish dropsie, and is such a dropsie wherin the water which lyeth betweene the skin and the flesh is dispersed through the whole body, through each member and in the face, and maketh them swell; so that the belly and the nauell do not swel alone: in which swelling if that it be pressed with the finger, then doth the dint or pit remaine long after in it. The priuie members do swell, also a wa∣terish scouring or laske. The pulses will be slow and do beate longsome and leysurely. The causes of it are bad digestion: so that all the meate and drinke is at least the halfe part turned into a flegmaticke matter, whereby the same cannot as behooueth the assimilated to the other parts. When as then these foresaid signes be perceiued in the face and in the priuities, then may the sicknesse be taken well to be Anasarca, the which also of all other dropsies is most easiest to be cured, because that it diuideth it selfe into all the parts of the body, and for that cause may be the easier ouercome by nature. For this are these remedies ensuing to be vsed. First, if it be a woman, and that the same sicknesse is fallen vpon her, and caused through retention and let of her termes, or obstruction of the Hemorrhoides; then is care to be had through all meanes to helpe and to prouoke them. And in case that the same cannot be compassed and effected, then is the Saphea or Milt veine to be opened: and likewise to set boxing cups on the thighes and legs. But for all other species of Dropsies letting of bloud is very hurtfull, for that they haue but little bloud, yet very much moisture; whereby the good bloud being drawne out, the water will be left behind. For this, is to be giuen to the patient this sirupe following for to open him: like as is taught in the 4. §. of the diseases of the liuer. Item, Trocisci de lacca, are especiall good for this: and afterwards he must euery wéeke be purged with pils of Rubarbe. Or take these pils ensuing: Agregatiuae two scruples, Ammoniaci one scruple, and make seuen pils of it with Oxymel. The pils de Hiera, de Aloe, de Mezereo, Foetidae, de Agarico, are altoge∣ther very méet for this vse. It is also admonished before to vse reasonable exercise, hunger and thirst. More waking than sleeping is very commodious. Item, water bathes (if one can come to them) are also very good for this, which be by nature warme: or in the stead of them to bathe in drie baths, and then to sweate well. Such persons must also in warme seasons, and when the wind is downe, lye with their bellies towards the heate of the Sunne, and let the same be well rubbed. Some do aduise also, that the armes and the legs must be well rubbed. This confection following is very fit to purge and expell water: Take Turbith halfe an ounce, Hermodactili one ounce, péeled wild Saffron séedes thrée quarters of an ounce, Ginger, Cinnamom and Annis, of each one scruple, Violets, Cuscuta, Sorrel seede, of each one dragm, hony of Roses foure ounces, Sugar two ounces: séeth the Hony and the Sugar with a litle of the water of Fumitorie vntill you may scum it: when it is sodden enough, then mixe the rest with it vnto a Confection. Giue thereof halfe an ounce at once. Another. TAke one dragme of Rubarbe, Annis, wild yellow Rapeséede, and Indy Spica, of each one scruple, Licorice one dragme, Asarabacca half a drag. Conserue of Marioram one ounce, Conserue of Roses thrée ounces, Miua cydoniorum and Oxymel, as much as you will, for to make a Confection. This Confection strengtheneth and expelleth much the water. Yet another. Take Elecampane rootes, Ireos and Gentian, of each one dragme, Ireos
losinges one ounce, sirupe of Horehound one ounce and a halfe; then make a Confection therof. Take thereof as often as you please: it strengtheneth, doth quench thirst and lengthen the breath. The auncient Phisitions do aduise much for to vomit, to wit, at the first in the beginning of the sicknesse whilst that the patient is in state of strength, but not otherwise. Some do write, that dried Hedgehogs flesh doth maruellously ease in this sicknesse, if one take of the same one quarter of an ounce in wine. The like is also reported of the Wolfes Li∣uer, if the same be taken with Rubarb & Rapontica, with water wherin Wormwood is decocted. Of the Dropsie Ascites. §. 14. THis Dropsie some do call Ascliten, and Alchiten. In this Dropsie the belly doth onely swell and the legges, and contrarily the vpper parts of the bodie do dry a∣way. This name is giuen to this species of Dropsies, of a hyde wherein men do cary Wine or Oyle. Of all other signs this sicknes is a great trouble in the belly, when one clappeth or soundeth vpon it he doth heare a rumbling or a noise of water which is forcibly stirred a∣bout, the which also happeneth if the sick person do turne himselfe from the one side to the other: the bodie is not so swolen throughout like as in the foresaid Dropsie, neither do there remaine therein any dents or pits if one presse therein with the finger. The nauel doth not stand so puf∣fed vp as in the Tympanite, the pulse is féeble, swift, and small. The cause of this Dropsie is féeblenes of the Liuer, which hath not a sanguification or con∣coction, and altereth all her moisture into water. This infection of the Liuer may be caused as well of heate as of cold: also of the water which is ingendred in the Lyuer, that falleth downe afterwards into the lower parts and hollownes of the belly. If this Dropsie do come through hote causes, after any paine of the Lyuer, after an Ague, by swelling vp the belly beneath the Nauell euen to the very hip: also if one turne the sicke per∣son about one heareth the water, he hath an intolerable thirst, auoideth but litle vrine which is fierie red, with some clots as it were with smal stones: then is there great danger, and but smal hope of life to be had. For if so be that one giue to the patient medicins which do coole the heate, then is the Liuer enféebled, the water and wind augmented: if that warme and drying things be vsed for it, then doth the heate and excessiue thirst increase. But not to leaue this sicke person vtterly comfortlesse, and to please his friends, you may vse for the lengthening of his life moderate cold and warm things, like as is this sirupe following: Take Endiue foure handfuls, Maiden haire and Harts toung, of each one handfull, Fennell séede, Parsly seede, and Cuscuta, of each halfe an ounce, Spica Nardi, Spica Romana, of each one quarter of an ounce, and Sugar sixe ounces, make a clarified sirupe of it. In like sort may also this cooling confection following be vsed, as Diarrhodon, Dialacca, Dia∣crocoma, Diatrisantalon, and Aromaticum Rosatum, and other such like cooling things mo. Also the Wolfes lyuer (like as herebefore for Anasarca is said) is very highly commended for this, if the same be giuen with Endiue water, for it should (euen as many thinke) reduce the Lyuer to her right state. Also for to coole the heate of the lyuer may this plaister following be made and applyed vpon it: Take the iuice of Endiue, of small Endiue, of Agrimonie, of Liuerwort, of each two ounces, Barly meale as much as will suffise to make a plaister withall. It happeneth also very often that in this Ascite the patient is hard bound in body, who if he be knowne of sufficient strength, then is he to be often purged (as is already said) yt which may be effected through sundry meanes, as through Pils, Potions, and through Clisters, whereof there be many herebefore described for the obstruction of the Lyuer, and are also very requisite for this purpose, and amongst the rest these following may also be vsed: First, let pils be made with Rubarb, which be acuated with a litle Mezereo, and be giuen vnto him once a weeke. Also the pils of Mezereo, are very good for this vse, but they must be taken in hand very cir∣cumspectly: for that the Mezereon is maruellous sharpe, as herebefore in the introduction you may well perceiue.
Item: Take of the foresaid Mezereon leaues which haue bene stéeped two daies and two nights before in the iuice of Quinces and Vineger, & dried againe, half a drag. make small pils thereof: it expelleth water wonderfully. The like haue you before in the 4. §. good pils in the obstructiō of the liuer, beginning: Take Spica, &c. The iuice of wild Cucumbers, or Elaterium is also good for this, but it must be giuen with great circumspection; for there is no man so strong that may take aboue halfe a scruple. Our Phisitions do seldome take aboue foure graines at once, as is amplier spoken of in the Introduction. Item, take clouted Goats milk thrée ounces, the iuice of blew Flower-deluce halfe an ounce; séeethe it on a small fire vnto the halfe or more; strain it & temper it in a litle Suger, & so take it. Or take the iuice of blew Flower-deluce which is very cleare one ounce, drink it with some Sugar, or with some Goates milk once in euery 4. daies: & the daies betwéene both is he to drinke a good draught of Béere decocted with Worme∣wood, or Wormwood powder with 2. ounces of Sugar cast into sugar plates, & eate therof. In Italy they haue an herbe called Soldonella, ye iuice wherof is much vsed for ye dropsie: also the wa∣ter & powder of the herbe: or in stead thereof may be vsed for the dropsie, of ye said blew Flower-deluce: for that Soldonella wt groweth neare the sea & all salt places, is giuen with wine wherein Rapontica with a litle Wormwood is decocted. What force Wormwood hath in this disease is sufficiently shewed in the end of the 9. §. Also what vertue the wild Saffron séed hath for the Dropsie, looke for the same in the Introduction; the like also of the éedes of Manus Christi. A powder to purge withal: Take beaten Ireos thrée dragmes, Ginger two scruples, Annis, Masticke, of each one scruple, white sugar Candie one dragme, Turbith one quarter of an ounce, Diagridion sixe graines: take one dragme therof; it expelleth the water and the going to stoole very vehemently. But if there be any heate withall, then are these mild purgations to be vsed: Take the flowers of Burrage, Violets, Fumitorie, of each halfe an ounce, Licorice, Iuiu∣bes, Currans, and Wormwood, of each one quarter of an ounce, eight or ten Prunes, Spicanar∣di one dragme: séethe them all in whay of Goates milke, and stéepe therein halfe an ounce of the shels of yellow Mirobalans for a potion. Item, take sixe ounces of the whay of Goates milke, and fresh rootes of the Flower-deluce which be well cleansed from their shels halfe an ounce; séeth the same vntill two parts remain, then temper them together for a purgation. Clisters, as is before discoursed are also maruellous good for all such dropsies, whereof cer∣taine do follow: Take Ebulus, Cammomill, and S. Iohns wort, of each one handful: Let them séeth sufficiently in water; then take of this decoction twelue or sixtéene ounces, Sallad oyle thrée spoonefuls, halfe an ounce of Hiera Pachij, or Hiera Picra, Salt one dragme; temper them then together. Item, take the broth of Tripes, or any other fresh flesh broth, Pease pottage, or any other that one hath readie in the stead of common water; and in the stead of Hiera, take pre∣pared Cassie for Clisters. This following doth loose more: Take Mallowes, Hollihockes, Beetes, Cammomill, and the herbe Mercurie, of each one handfull: Seeth it in water or in any of the foresaid brothes, and take thereof twelue or sixteene ounces, Salt, Oyle, Hiera or Cassie, Hiera Picra, Benedicta Laxatiua, of each halfe an ounce; temper them together, and minister this Clister very warme. This following draweth from the head: Take Rosemarie, Betonie, Cammomill, and Saint Iohns wort, of each one handfull, Polipodie, wild Saffron seede grosse beaten, of each half an ounce, and seeth them well. This being done, take as much broth and do as is beforesaid: there may also be vsed in stead of common oile, the oyle of Linseede. If there be great griping of the belly with it, then may also be vsed with the foresaid herbes, Annis, Fennell, Caraway, all together, or those that one can get: Take the waight of an ounce thereof beaten all together grosse. Clisters are not onely good for the Dropsie, but also against all griping of the belly, against the grauel, against the obstructions, against the yellow Iaundise, shoorings, and such like. But in case that with this Dropsie there be any scouring or red flixe: then are Trociskes to be giuen to the patient, of Barberies with Vineger: for these Trociskes do coole, supple, and strengthen the liuer, and stay the scouring. The same do also Trocisci de Spodio, de Sandalis, and the iuice of Quinces, and all that is made thereof. Item, the Conserue and confected rootes of Cicorie, by reason that they a binding and cooling operation. But if so be that the Ascites be without an ague, and there be no rednes séene in the water,
then may these pils following be giuen. Take prepared leaues of Mezereon and Sagapenum, of each one scruple, and make this to pilles with the iuice of Wormwood, but giue no more at once then the fourth part onely, for they ex∣pell and purge very forcibly. What things do moue Vrine. IN the beginning of the description of the Dropsie, it is (amongst other things) thus decla∣red, that the chiefest meane for to cure this sicknesse, is to expell vrine, and to auoide the same in great abundance, the which may be atchieved through these meanes following: Take Rue, S. Iohns woort, Peniroyall, Sage, Marioram gentle, Wormewood, Licorice, Annis, Fennell, and Elecampane roots, of each one quarter of an ounce, séeth them together in a quart of Wine, but not too long; then drinke thereof in the morning thrée ounces, and as much more in the euening. Item, take Garlicke and S. Iohns woort, of each one handfull, séeth them to∣gether in a pint of Wine vntill a third part be decocted: afterwards straine it thorough, and when you please drinke a litle thereof at one time, it dryeth vp the water, and expelleth the rest through the vrine. Item, take the whay of Goats milke foure ounces, séeth three dragmes of Spica nardi in it vnto thrée ounces, and giue it him to drinke fasting. Or take one ounce of the iuice of Nep. Also white Wine wherein the flowers of Rosemarie and the herbe be decocted, is very méete for this. Item, the vineger of Squils is also very good. The Trociscide Lacca, or Crocoma, one quarter of an ounce giuen at one time with any of the foresaid iuices, be especiall good for this. Item, Rubarb, Asarabacca, Diptamus, Cinnamome, Agrimonie, Marioram gentle, Rue, Myrrhe, all together, or each alone stéeped in Wine, are very fit for the Dropsie, or any other maladie. In the description of the yellow Iaundise in the eleuenth §. haue you also amongst other potions, a very good potion fit for this, beginning. Take Gentian, &c. These things following do also expell vrine, namely, Hermodactili, Indie Spica, Licorice, Cinnamome, Fennell, Betonie, Vineger, Parsly rootes, Sage, and Rosemarie, séeth any of these things in Wine; and in three or foure ounces of the same Wine dissolue one dragme of the trociskes De Lacca, but aboue all other these here be very commodious: Item, the rootes of Nettles, of Parsly, Fennel, Elecampane roots, Asarabacca, powned all together, or each alone, taking one dragme thereof, or wine drunke wherein the same hath bene a while decocted. The rootes of great Ferne boyled in Wine and drunke, expell vrine very much. Of all herb wines are commended aboue all other things for the Dropsie, to wit, wine of Gilloflowers, rootes of Marioram gentle, Betony, Asarabacca, and of Hyssope, but all troubled wines are contrarie to this disease. Outwardly are sundrie plaisters vsed, and it is reported that they do bring foure kinds of commodities: first, they do supple, drie, expell wind, and do strengthen the belly and all the in∣trailes, like as these following are: Take Coloquint, Hollihocke séedes, Diagridion, Aloe, Myrrhe, roots of Mallowes and Bdellion, of each one dragme and a halfe, Ireos three dragmes, séedes of Mallowes, wild Cucumbers, Cardamome and Euphorbium, of each thrée drag. Boreas, Sal gemmae, of each one quarter of an ounce, Goose grease, Duckes grease, Calues, & Hogs sut, as much as is néedfull for to make a plaister or a salue, lay this plaister vpon the belly, it doth supple much. The plaister of Bayberries is also speciall good for the Dropsie, & moreouer much mightier for it, if the same be tempered with Goates dung, or Cow dung. If the priuities be much swollen, then make this plaister following: Take Annis, Fennell, and Comin, beaten small together, of each one ounce and a halfe, Beane meale, Ebulus, the iuice of Elderne leaues, and good Wine as much as will suffise, lay it vpon the belly, and ouer the priuities. Another: Take Barly meale, Cypers rootes, dryed Shéepes dung, Borace and Bolus, of each a like quantitie, beate them together, make a plaister thereof and apply it to the belly. This plaister hath great force to exsiccate and drie the water. Item, take Cow dung, or Goats dung, and temper them with the vrine of a man child vnto a plaister. Or take Oxe dung which
is dryed in an ouen, powne it to powder, and make thereof a plaister with Wine, and then lay it on the belly. Another: Take fat Figs thrée ounces, Pigeon dung halfe an ounce, Masticke and Spike∣nard of each halfe a dragme, powne all that is to be powned, and then make it to a plaister with Goates pisse. Of all other salues is that of Agrippa much commended, which is knowne at all Apothe∣caries, for it is maruellous good for the Dropsie. There is also another made, that is Arthanita, of Swines bred which is not so common. For a common inunction the oyle of Cammomil and of Rue tempered together is very commodious. But it is also to be noted, that if so be that the Dropsie do come out of any cold occasion, that then this foresaid plaister is to be layd vpon the whole belly, and the cooling things vpon the Lyuer. Sweating is very good for all Dropsies. §. 15. IT is shewed, that among other releuations and expulsions of superfluous moi∣stures of mans bodie sweating is accounted one: therefore it is very néedefull to write somewhat thereof, and how that the sweate, especially for Dropsies, is moued. We haue also written in another place of a drie sweate bath, the which for the difference thereof we will rehearse here againe. Take a flat tub, turne the same vpside downe ouer a hote harth, and make vnder this tub a small fire of Elderne wood or Iuniper wood without smoke vntill it be thorough warme. When it is then hote, set hoopes about it that it may be couered close, then set the patient in the same tub couered euery where close, yet so that his head be without. Afterwards he is to rub him well, to the end he may sweate well: drie away the sweate, and let him sit in it as long as he can abide it. Item, take Ebulus, Beane straw, of each a like quantitie, séeth them toge∣ther, and make thereof a sweating bath with hote stones, as is accustomed. It is also good to drinke a dragme of the powder of Bayberries with Wine, and chiefly after the sweating. Con∣serue of Elderne (taken fasting before sweating) after purging, causeth abundant sweate, and doth expell the fountaine or beginning of the Dropsie. This following should be maruellous auailable for the Dropsie through sweating: Take of the middlemost gréene rind of the Elder eight good handfuls, Carduus Benedictus sixe hand∣fuls, Rosemarie thrée handfuls, the vppermost sprigges of Elder thrée handfuls, choppe all these small together, then put them into a glasse, and powre vpon it two quarts of white Wine; then stoppe it very fast, and so set it the space of fourteene dayes in horse dung, and af∣terwards distill it in séething water, whereof giue the patient one spoonfull twice a day. But at the first time giue him very litle of it: and if he can abide it, then giue him more. This hath bene tryed in a thicke fat woman: that she must be laid vpon a leather bed, that the sweate through this medicine hath runne so extreamely from her, that it must be laden vp with dishes. The great Treacle Diatessaron, and Mithridate, one dragme, or a dragme and a halfe taken with Wine, or any of the foresaid waters do vehemently expell sweate. In like manner is very commodious for this all that is set downe for the yellow Iaundise, for prouoking vrine, and expelling of grauell. Certaine famous auncient Phisitions do aduise, that vnto them that haue the Dropsie, shal Treacle be giuen, and that thereupon they should be made sweate vpon a boord in a warme Ouen, hauing their head out. But I cannot much approue the same. The like grosse meanes, like as to burie the sicke person warme in the said and other things moe, there be of many men many described. But I will not rehearse them all, because I haue declared some that be more necessarie and tolerable.
Of the Dropsie Tympanites. §. 16. THis Tympania or Tympanites, is also properly called Hydrops, which is a Dropsie: because that it is rather caused to wind then of water, and hath therfore her name for that the belly as in other Dropsies, is here also puffed vp higher: the Nauell is thrust foorth on high: and because all other members do consume and waxe very leane: yea for that the belly is hard swollen, that one clapping or knocking vpon it  giueth a cleare and hollow sound. In these sicknesses, the patient ought not to eate at any hand any gréene herbes, nor yet any thing else which maketh or ingendreth wind, as Spinage, Béetes, Coleworts, new fruites, Pease, Beanes, Turneps, boyled Rice, or any such like. He must also beware of milke, Cheese, Chestnuts, vnleauened bread, and Must. He must also eschue all cold, and keep himselfe alwaies warme, and to sweate if it be possible, euen as we haue said before. And the belly must be dai∣ly well warmed with warme Panicke or Millet wherewith is mixt a little Salt: for this cau∣seth the wind to breake away. In like manner shall boxing cups also be set vpon it vnpickt. All these things following are good for him: to wit, the Confection Diacyminum, or de Baccis Lauri vsed often, and other mo that be written hereafter for the griping of the belly. But aboue all and for all Dropsies, the prepared Wolfes lyuer is very much commended, be it powdered or eaten otherwise amongst other meate: for it hath an excellent and priuie ver∣tue to expell the Dropsie. Item, these things following may be vsed for all Dropsies, if there be no heate with it, as Conserue of Elderne leaues, of Betony, Gilloflowers, and of Rosemarie, Fennell, Annis Ca∣thirst, and much watching are also good for this. These suppositories also following are very méete for this purpose: Take Sal gemmae, Rue, Beuercod, Euphorbium, and Nettle seede, of each one drag. decocted Hony about thrée ounces, and make thereof suppositories. These following be not so strong: Take Comin, Boreas, Rue-séede, of each a like quantitie, Hony as much as is néedfull for to make suppositories. Also let the belly be rubbed with rough linnen vntill it be red. And when the wind doth not blow, let the Sun shine vpon it. This plaister following is maruellous good for this: Take dryed Goates dung twelue ounces, rootes of wild Cucumbers, and rootes of Ebulus, of each two ounces, Barley meale twelue ounces, steeled Vineger foure ounces; make a plaister thereof, boyled well with sharpe Lée: this plaister consumeth all windie matter, openeth the pores, and draweth all wind out of the body if it be laid warme thereon. The belly is also to be annointed with oyles which be of a hote nature: to wit, with oyle of Dill, oyle of Rue, of Costus and of Bayberries. Of Clisters we haue spoken before: but for this are such chiefly to be vsed as do expell the winds, as this following is: Take Ireos, Hyssope, Smallage, Rue, Bearefoote, of each one handfull, Annis, Fennell, Ameos, Bayberries, of each half an ounce; let them séeth well. Take afterwards of this decoction twelue or sixtéene ounces, if the patient be méetly strong: then put vnto it clarified Hony, and oyle of Rue of each one ounce and a halfe, and stone Salt one drag. There may also Hiera Picra be put vnto it: for the same is maruellous good for to driue out all bad humors, and to leaue the good. Here do now follow certaine Sirupes moe which are to be vsed for all Dropsies, like as the common sirupe of Eupatoriae, which is good for all cold diseases and obstructions of the Lyuer, and therefore is good for the dropsie: it extenuateth all tough and grosse humors, it comforteth the Lyuer, it expelleth water, and hindereth all swellings of the inward parts. In Italy is the ensuing sirupe of Ireos much vsed: Take gréene rootes of Ireos fowre and twenty ounces; cut them in péeces, steepe them the space of thrée dayes in as much wel Water as will couer them: stir them about twice a day, but that they may be couered vnder the wa∣ter: afterwards straine the water frō them, and powre other water vpon them, as before: keepe the first water in a cleane pot, and do the second time as you did at the first: Then temper both these waters together, or seeth each alone with a little Sugar. Afterwards mixe these things following with it; to wit, Scabious, and Maidenhaire, of each one handfull, Sperage
rootes, Fennell rootes, Ireos rootes, of each halfe a handfull, péeled Melon séede, Gourd séedes, Cucumber seedes, and peeled Pompeon seedes, séedes of Purslaine, of Cicorie, of Endiue, and of Lettice, of each one quarter of an ounce, Fennell, Annis, Sperage séede, and Smallage séede, of each halfe a dragme, Millet, and winter Cherries, of each thrée dragmes, fatte Dates, and Figs, of each sixe, Liccorice, Madder, of each fiue dragmes: let them séeth all together vnto the halfe, and afterwards séeth the decoction with sufficient Sugar vnto a sirupe. Some do giue this sirupe a pleasant tast with Cinnamome. Other do stéepe therein one quarter of an ounce of Rubarbe against the obstruction and debilitie of the lyuer. The Italian Phisitions do giue thereof, when they will prepare any bad humor, not aboue one ounce at the first, and afterwards a little more, vntill they be wholly purged with it. It is also to be noted, that when this Sirupe waxeth old, it looseth the purguing vertue. Also we will now speake of the iuice of the blew Flower-deluce: When it is giuen alone, it annoyeth the stomack, and causeth the red or bloudie flixe. Further, for this sicknes is to be vsed the sirupes de Radicibus, de Absynthio, Capillis Ʋeneris, de Betonica, and such like moe. When it appeareth that the swelling of the belly, of the legs, and of the priuities doth de∣crease (be it in whatsoeuer Dropsie it will) the boyle Ebulus with the root & herbe and bathe or foment therewith the swolne places, or wash it with common Lye which is somewhat salted. Other do aduise this following: Take Marioram, Wormwood, field Mints, Parietarie, the rootes and leaues of Ebulus, Marioram gentle, Cammomill, and Maydenhaire, all together or which you will: séethe them in Wine or Lye, and therewith bath the members, but alwaies after purging, for otherwise it is not requisite. Marke also, that for all sorts or kinds of Dropsies, the remedies are often to be altered, taking now one sort, and another time ano∣ther sort: and that for this is alwaies a good order of dyet, as we shall here briefly note, and set foorth. The order of Diet. WE haue heretofore sufficiently shewed that sobrietie is good and néedfull for all Dropsies. It is therefore required, that one do eate but once a day. Partridges are good for him, Turtle doues, and other young Pigeons, Kids, rostmeate, Pullets, Fowles drest with Veriuice and the iuice of Limons, Barly or Spelt dread which is raised and well-baked, are also good for him. He may also eate sometimes Endiue, Sorrell and Cicorie, with Vineger, or a Sallad with Sorrel and Parsly. And for a conclusion, we are to say somewhat more for opening the skin in this Dropsie, therby to let out the water. The which the learned do permit at the last, when the patient hath his legs and priuities full of water, that the same be then opened with a Lancet, thereby to let out the water, but not much at once. But in truth this is a slender helpe, and féebleth the sicke more then it doth strengthen: for inwardly as much water hath a course vnto it as may be let∣ten out. Other do open the legs with Cantharides. The third sort do cauterise the belly two or thrée fingers broad beneath the Nauell, so that there as much as may be they do draw ouer and open the skin, and that chiefly in Ascite, where it ought most to be vsed. We will also note at this present, that because oftentimes before the hote Euphorbium hath bene remembred, the same is not to be vsed but in the greatest extremitie, euen as his nature and operation are at large described in the Introduction. The thirteenth Chapter. Of the Gall. WIthin the middest of the Lyuer is a bladder established by nature, where∣in is kept and gathered all bitter and sharp humors which are separated from the bloud: which humors the Grecians do call Choleram, the Lati∣nists Bilem, and we call, the Gall. The nature of this humor is described after thrée kinds of waies: to wit, light gréene Cholera, yellow Cholera, and lastly, black Cholera, like as before is sufficiently shewed. This black choler (by reason of her colour) is also called of the Grecians Melancho∣lia, and is cold, drie, sharpe, and heauie, and also none other then dregs,
and yeast of the grosse bloud: for it is nothing else but a yellow Cholera, that is, Oxymel burnt, whereby the yellow and gréene Cholera are easily altered into black Cholera. How this blacke Cholera doth make men mad and raging, in the first part, in the twelfth Chapter, and 8. §. is suf∣ficiently declared, and also shall be taught hereafter. It happeneth either through extremitie of heate or cold, that the black Cholera, appeareth ra∣ther in the winter, and the yellow Cholera in sommer time. For when as the conduits which do carie those superfluities into the Gall are obstructed, then is the yellow Cholera dispersed through the whole bodie, with the rest of the bloud, which causeth the yellow Iaundise; and otherwhiles, by reason of their sharpnesse and heate, a certaine Ague. Or if it get wholy the vp∣per hand, then doth it cause many kinds of ill and sharpe exulcerations, wherof we are to write more at large in other places. Thus for to remedie this Cholera, and the foresaid Ague thereby, is this generall rule pre∣scribed by Galen. At the first it hapneth otherwhiles, that the Gall doth send her superfluitie to the stomacke, whereby the digestion is hindred and spoyled, and the patient getteth great infirmitie: for this, there is no fitter meane to exonerate him thereof; than by vomiting, and that chiefly when one is fasting. Contrariwise is the Melancholia, which through her heauinesse descendeth downewards, to be purged through the stoole, which may be most commodiously effected through Clisters, afterwards through sweating, and through the vrine. And how this ought to be put in practise, is sufficiently declared before in the Dropsie, and yellow Iaundise. In like manner it is especiall good to bath in swéete water, for thereby will both the said cholericke humors be moystned and cooled, if it be done in due time. This patient is also to forbeare Wine, euen till the declination of the sicknesse. And when the sicknesse beginneth to decline, then is he to vse small, watered, and but a litle wine. All meates that moisten and coole are good for these Aguish folke, if the same be soberly vsed. These herbes following may also be drest in his meate; as Orage, Béetes, Sorrell, Mal∣lowes, Lettice, Gourds. Also Barly paps (which is Ptisana) and fish which is caught in grauel∣ly waters. All Fowles are good for him which haue a soft and tender flesh, or the pinions of the grosse and hard fowles. The braines and feet of Swine, small birds, and rere sodden  be good, but chiefly the yolkes which are more nourishing, and lighter to be digested. He may vse all fruites that remaine not long in the stomacke; but he must refraine Hony, Mustard, salt and sharpe meates. This may suffise of the Gall, of her bladder, nature, & of the tertian Ague which is caused by it. Of which Ague, amongst other, shall be further written in the sixt part. The sicknesses be∣sides, which be caused through Cholera, shall be described more at large in their due places. The fourteenth Chapter. Of the Milt or Spleene. THis third part of mans bodie containeth also in it the Milt, which the Grecians do call Splen, and the Latinists Lien, a knowne and necessarie part of mans bodie. It hath his place in the left side ouer against the Li∣uer and the Gal, next of all to the stomack. And if this were not found in the left side but in the right side (like as the same before time hath bene séene) then is it reputed to be against nature. This Milt is fastened to the backe with certaine sinewes, where the ribs do take end: and with one end it stretcheth to the Lyuer in the right side. Her substance and essence is a tender and soft flesh, like to a sponge; yet to be compared to the Lights, it is so much harder and faster, as she is softer and tenderer then the Liuer. She hath also many veines and arteries, whereby she draweth easily vnto her the grosse melancho∣licke humors out of the Lyuer, by which she is fed and sustained. She is different in colour to the Milt of beasts: for it is blacke gray, of forme long and thin: and of all fourefooted beasts there is none which more agréeth with the Spléene of a man, then that of a Hog.
The office of this Milt is none other but to cleanse the liuer from all melancholick humors, and that is brought to passe through the said veines, whereby she draweth vnto her the same grosse humours, where she keepeth and retaineth the cleanest, and driueth from her the rest through certaine passages and conduits: which if it be not performed, the spléene is so weakned that it cannot perfectly draw vnto it the same melancholicke humors, and then there proceede out of it diuers melancholick sicknesses; as namely, heauinesse of mind, desperat madnesse, and such like. This disease of the spléene hath his certaine and outward signes: as when one is sorowfull, then doth he commonly feele paine about the Spleene where melancholie hath her residence. Yea there is also written thereof, & beleeued by many, that if men were depriued of their spléen, then they should thereby loose all their laughing, and that their laughing and mirth doth aug∣ment according to the increase of the spléene. Also the foresaid feeblenesse of the Milt causeth exulcerations, swellings, leaprie, the canker, and such like. And albeit, that it do draw the melancholicke humors vnto it, yet neuerthelesse can she not by reason of her féeblenesse expell the superfluitie of the same: but swelleth, wherby an Impostume may easily follow. If then it force the biting and sharpe matter excessiuely into the stomacke; then doth it there cause the insatiable Dogs hunger, whereof we haue written in the eleuenth Chapter and fiue and thirty §. Or if the same harden in the stomacke, then doth it cause vomiting: the bowels will thereby be made sore and deadly annoyed, and also afflicted with moe other perillous accidents: by all which it may easily be perceiued, how much the health of this part importeth. Therefore it is to the contrarie much to be maruelled at, that certaine Beasts can be who∣ly without it. And so daily experience sheweth, that how much the lesse a mans spléene is, so much the faster may one run, and do the more labour. The chiefest diseases of the spleene, be inflammations, obstructions, and schirrosities: of which the obstructions and hardenings do depend so fast one vpon another, that the one cannot be well without the other. And the Phisitions haue also no other difference in vse, than that there be vsed for the obstructions mo inward medicines, than for the hardnes or schirrosity: for in the hardnes of the same must outward things be vsed, whether the same be caused through heate, cold, or wind, which do come commonly with it: So that the spléene in all these diseases hath great affinitie with the Liuer: and so all that which is ordained for the Liuer, is also ser∣uing for the spléene. And now to write briefly of the occasions of these maladies, whether the same be alwaies moued through inward or outward causes. The outward causes may be such meates and drinks as do ingender melancholicke bloud: as Chéese, Coleworts, salted flesh, and such like, according as hath bene said in the first part, of Melancholia. The inward causes do come of the Liuer; or when the melancholick humors be too in any; or when the spléene hath a bad complexion, whether it procéede of Cholera, Phlegma, wind, or any other occasion. Of the obstruction of the Spleene with heate, and an ague. §. 1. THe obstructed Spléene hath these signes: to wit, an hardnes which one may féele outwardly, with paine, swelling, thirst, thin and il-fauoured colour of the vrine, a heauie ratling breath, bad colour of the face and of the whole bodie, heauinesse of mind, terrible dreames, and such like. But with the impostume is alwaies this difference, that the paine is in one place onely: but in the hardnes of the spléene without impostumation, the paine is ouer all the whole spléene. These diseases do also make the whole bodie leane, because that the Liuer doth not performe her naturall digestion, and in stead of good bloud doth ingender bad humors, wherewith the whole bodie is fed and nourished. If with this paine of the spléene through heate, be Agues and a red vrine adioyned; then are these cooling things to be vsed for it: to wit, Lettice, Endiue with their séede, Saunders, burnt Iuorie, the séedes of Melons, Pompeons, Gourds, and of Cucumbers, Vineger, & such like. Of compounded things, the confection Trisantali, &c. These things following are tempe∣rate,
and not onely good for the Milt or Spléene, but also for the Stomacke, Liuer, Gall, and for all inward parts, as Cammomill, Melilot, Lilly rootes, Burrage, water Lillies, Fumitorie, Maidenhaire, and Hares toung. But to procéede methodically, then is the patient first to vse these things following: Take Caper rootes, rindes of Tamariscus, the innermost gréene rinds of the Ash tree, and the blos∣somes of Broome, of each one ounce, Endiue, Purslaine, small Endiue, Maidenhaire, of each one handfull, the seedes of Pompeons, of Cucumbers, of Gourds, and the séede of Melons, of each one ounce, Hony thrée ounces, Sugar nine ounces: let the foresaid roots be stéeped a whole night in Vineger, then afterwards make a sirupe thereof, and giue two or thrée ounces of it (according as the cause requireth) with Endiue water, and that for the space of foure or fiue dayes in the morning fasting. For this are also these Sirupes good, to wit, the sirupe of vine∣ger, of Oxymel simplex and Compositum, Oxysacchara, Vineger of Squils, and his Oxymel, Acetosus, Diarrhodon, de Fumo Terrae, de Epithymo, de Pomis, de Duabus, & 5. Radicibus, of Burrage, and of Buglosse, of each half an ounce, Currans one ounce, Annis one quarter of an ounce, Po∣lipodie rootes halfe a dragme: seeth the foresaid all together in sufficient water, vntill there re∣maine about foure ounces: Stéepe therein a whole night Mirobalani Indi, then wring them wel out, and drinke it bloud warme early in the morning. You may also for both of them in stead of the Mirobalani, temper amongst it one quarter of an ounce of the confection of Sene leaues, or Hiera Picra. Also this following may be vsed to purge withall: Take Confectionis Hamech, halfe an ounce, or Diaphoeniconis thrée quarters of an ounce. Item, pils of Indie, called Pillulas Indas one dragme: the Sene leaues may also be well taken, but hereafter followeth a briefer, safer, and a more méete way. Take the confection of Sene leaues, and temper it (according to the strength and age of the partie) with Rubarbe and Burrage water; giue it him warme fasting, and afterwards vse these Pils. Take Ammoniacum one dragme, Tamariscus, Harts toung, and the séede of Agnus castus, of each halfe a scruple: make nine pils thereof with the sirupe of Vineger, whereof the patient is to take a litle for the space of eight dayes together before supper, and one or twayne after sup∣per, and then afterwards take this potion. Take the water of Tamariscus, of Harts tong, and Cicorie, of each one ounce and a halfe, Vineger of Squils one quarter of an ounce, white Sugar halfe an ounce, then temper them together: this are you thus to drinke in the morning fasting, and then take of the foresaid pils twaine, and so continue it during the space of ten dayes. But especially you are to vse the po∣tion, for it is the most forcible medicine for the Spléene that may be found. In like manner is this also excéedingly commended: Take the whay of milke, stéepe Harts toung, Epithymum and Calmus in it, and so let it stand a whole night: afterwards you may seeth this a little while, and drinke often thereof. Likewise the séede of Purslaine, Calmus, and the rootes of Cicorie, of each a like quantitie: is very good being taken with the sirupe of Vi∣neger. Of those things which conuey the medicine towards the Milt. IT is of no small importance to know the vse of those things which may conuey the prepa∣ratiue and purgatiue medicines towards the Spléene, like as hath bene said elsewhere: This doth Tamariske, Harts toung, Caper rootes, Mather, burnt Squils, Scordium, wild yellow Rapeseede, Nep, Spica of Indie, Calmus, Ireos, Horehound, Wormewood, Agrimonie, Annis, Fennell, Cuscuta, the seede of Agnus castus, small Germander, and bitter Almonds. When as then the sicke bodie hath bene purged, the Milt veine is to be opened: or if the me∣lancholicke humors do abound, then is the Lyuer veine to be opened, for that this melancho∣lick humor doth mixe it selfe with the bloud. Some aduise, and that not without reason, that Leches should be set in the fundament on the Pyle veines, because that by nature they do draw out the blacke bloud. For a strengthening and allaying of the heate, this following is to be gi∣uen, as confected Peaches, Cicorie rootes with Vineger, conserue of Roses, of water Lillies, of Cicorie, and of Violets. For his drinke, is allowed him otherwhiles a draught of Cherrie wine; for it is (as is
oftentimes said) altogether temperate, and do moisten the dried Spléene and the inward parts. Euery such patient is to beware of all sweet and grosse Wine, which is shewed before in the first Part. Of the impostume of the Spleene. §. 2. THis impostume may be caused out of bloud, of Phlegma, Cholera, and Melancho∣lia, as also of winds and obstruction. The outward occasions may be blowes, fals, great labour, and chiefly by that which happeneth in the heate, whereby the bloud is burned: Item, of grosse meates which make grosse bloud. The common signes of all impostumes of the Milt are paine, heauines, and swelling of the left side, which stretcheth it out from the bowels euen to the shoulder blade, and sometimes it bringeth also with it a healing breath. All the sowre humors do bring with them their proper signe like as is alreadie rehearsed, and for to remedie this present infirmitie, this is the right way. First of all you are to let him bloud on the Lyuer veine in the left elbow, and afterwards in the Milt veine vpon the left hand besides the small finger, and if so be that the patient may a∣bide it, then let the bloud runne vntill it staunch of it selfe. With purging, eating, and drinking is he to be kept, like as it is said in the twelfth Chap∣ter of the Lyuer. Otherwise is this following very commodious: to wit, distilled water of Purslaine, Maidenhaire, Willow leaues, Harts tong, Nightshade, of Smallage, and of Endiue, of which one wil, (alone or tempered together) & then the rootes of Capers beaten very small and tempered amongst it. You may also boyle the foresaid herbs, and vse the decoction of them tempered with the sirupe of Vineger. The first foure or fiue dayes the Milt is to be an∣nointed with this salue following: Take oyle of Roses one ounce and a halfe, oyle of Cammo∣mill and Vineger, of each halfe an ounce, then temper it together. The second of third day tem∣per amongst it halfe an ounce of the iuice of Nighshade. The first day vse this following: take oyle of Roses, Cammomill, and the iuice of Wormwood, of each a like much, annoint it very warme, and lay it vpon a warme cloth. Then lay this plaister following vpon it: Take Barly meale, powned Hollihock roots, of each two ounces, Roses, red and white Saunders, of each thrée dragmes, roots of Endiue one ounce, Vineger, and water of Harts tong, as much as is néedfull for to make a mild plaister. When as then the patient is letten bloud, purged, and hath drunken the foresaid water cer∣taine dayes together, he is to purge againe with Cassie, and with Epithymo: but if the impostume be of cold (which chanceth very seldome) then may it be knowne, for that it is very soft, white, and without paine. But if the same be caused through Melancholia, then doth the same shew it selfe hard, with small paine, and then may you vse that Oxymel compositum or Oxymel of Squils, with water wherein the rootes of Capers, Tamariscus, Harts toung, and such like be decocted. Concerning the purging of Melancholia, you shall shortly hereafter find perfect instructions. Of an obstructed Milt without Ague, but yet with paine. §. 3. FOr this is chiefly commended the Tamariscus, and yet about this, Harts tong, Caper rootes, Hony suckles, which haue altogether a maruellous power for to asswage the swelling of the Spléene. In like manner, Centorie, Valerian, and Meu, or in stead thereof, the rootes of wild Dill. These are the principall things which may be vsed for the foresaid disease. Againe, these things following are good for to warme the cold spleen: as Aristo∣logie, the middlemost rinds of the Ashen trée, Broome rootes, Burrage, Buglosse, Ammoniack, Rue, Thyme, Epithymus, bitter Almonds, the water of the Ash tree leaues, Annis, Fennell, Caraway, Ameos, Parsly rootes, the rootes of Smallage, of Sperage, Squils, and their vine∣ger, seede of Agnus castus, Lupins, Bdellium, and Beuercod. Of the compounded things are the Confections of Diacapparis, Diacalamintha, Diacyminum, confected Carawaies, and Comin, very god also. And albeit, that according to the opinion of Galen & others this obstruction of the Milt when the same waxeth old, is thought incurable: yet do ye successors neuertheles think that it is
very curable, although the obstruction of the foresaid Milt, and the hardnesse of the same had continued three or foure yeares. For which they do first giue things to open the spléene: to wit, one dragme of Mithridate, water of Sage two ounces, & that betimes in the morning, where∣vpon they require one to fast foure howers after. Item, take Squils and Oxymel, of each one ounce, sirupe de Eupatorio halfe an ounce, water of Valerian two ounces and a half: giue it him warme in the morning. Or take Maidenhaire, Politrichum, and Harts tong, of each foure scruples, Madder, Broome rootes, of each two scruples, fresh Well water 24. ounces, Vineger three ounces, Licorice one dragme and a halfe; séeth them afterwards together by a mild fire vnto the halfe: the patient is to drinke of this potion seuen or eight dayes together, euery mor∣ning foure ounces. The same is good and approued. Secondly, it is to be considered, how that this obstruction is to be opened. For this, it is good that one do take euery morning early one quarter of an ounce of washt Turpentine, and fast fiue or sixe howers vpon it: Or in stead of this, that he do swallow two or thrée pils made of Galbano. Thirdly, if so be that this wind be caused through wind, (whereof we are to speake more at large hereafter) then may one swallow halfe a dragme of Ammoniacum made into pils. Other take Pillulas Aggregatiuas, and Ammoniacum, of each halfe a dragme. Fourthly, to the end that the bad humors may be expelled out of the Milt, giue the patient one ounce and a halfe of the iuice of Horehound tempered with two ounces of Smallage wa∣ter, to drinke early in the morning. Fiftly, to the end that no grieuouser disease do strike into the Milt, and that the schirrositie or hardnesse might be mollified and discussed, take Hollihocke roots, and Swines bred, of each thrée handfuls, Bdellij, Ammoniaci, of each halfe an ounce, Centory, Wormewood, Harts tong, and Tamariscus of each one handfull and a halfe, Vineger sixe ounces; séeth them all together in a pot of Water, and stéepe a sponge therein, and lay it very warme on the left side: when the place is then very warme, couer it with a woollen cloth which is made wet before in stéeled Vineger, decocted water of Hony succles, and of Tamariscus. And if so be that this swelling do not asswage thereby, then vse this plaister following. Take the prepared marrow of an Oxe, Badgers grease, and the oyle of a Foxe, of each halfe an ounce, Tamariscus, Harts tong, Wormwood, Caper rootes, Spica of Indy, and Spica Romana, of each one dragme, Ammoniacum one ounce and a halfe, Bdellium halfe an ounce, oyle of Be∣hen two ounces, Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make a plaister with it: then make it like to a halfe Moone, and lay it on the left side: and then shall you sée in short time that the hardnes will weare away. Of hardnes, or Schirrus of the Spleene. §. 4. ALthough the auncient Phisitions were of opinion, that this hardning of the Milt were not difficult to be healed at the first, but were in déede if the same had long continued and were neglected, like as Galenus writeth, that he knew not how to cure it, neither had knowne any that could heale the same: Neuer∣thelesse one must not despaire, but administer fréely vnto it all strong outward and inward remedies. For how much the longer that this accident continueth, so much the lesse vexation hath the patient with it. But it is not to be neglected: for this dan∣ger is with it; that if the same do inueterate, then the patient might happen to fall into the Dropsie, whereby afterwards they commonly, one more, another lesse, happen to die with a laske or scouring. The signes of this hardnesse are the same that herebefore in the 2. §. and afterwards in the obstruction of the Spléen, are discouered. There is alwaies a heauines in the left side: the whole body, and especially the face, getteth an ash-coloured and il-fauoured colour: all the members will be weake, as if they were beaten in péeces. When the patient will do any exercise, then sée∣meth it as if his breath would depart. The signes of the impostume of the Milt are also descri∣bed: yet the same may be well knowne by the féeling. All that be sicke of the Milt, wil also be leane, very lither, out of courage, do get heauie legs, a heauie tong, and a thin vrine.
If with the paine of the Milt, or the swelling and hardnesse of the same, there be no Ague; then is the patient againe in the beginning of the cure to haue a veine opened: and especially if it be discerned that the veines be full of bloud, then is the Saphea on the foote to be opened, and after certaine dayes the Milt veine on the left hand. Afterwards are certaine sirupes to be vsed which do purge melancholy: For which this following, or such like is to be prepared: Take Ireos, Fennell rootes, and Parsly rootes, of each one ounce and a half, the inside of Squils one ounce, Capers rootes, the gréene rinds of an Ashen trée, and Broome rootes, of each one ounce, Maidenhaire, Harts tong, field Cipers, Germander, and Rosemarie flowers of each one hand∣full, Annis, Fennell, Cuscuta, Asarabacca, seeds of Purslaine, of each one dragme, Licorice and Currans, of each ounce, Tamariscus, flowers of Burrage and of Buglosse, of each half an ounce, Hony sixe ounces, Sugar nine ounces: make thereof a sirupe, and vse the same as hath bene said of others. This following is to be prepared for a purgation: Take Burrage, Buglosse, & Tamariscus flowers, of each halfe an ounce, Annis and Cuscuta, of each one quarter of an ounce, Thyme, Epythimus and Agaricus of each an ounce, Currans one ounce; seeth these all together in tenne ounces of water vnto the halfe: then take of this strained decoction thrée or foure ounces, and temper therein one quarter of an ounce of Hiera Picra, and also prepared Azure stone halfe a dragme: or in stead of this, one dragme of Bolus prepared, temper them together, and giue it him earely in the morning. Also you may make pils of the other things without the water. Another: Take Capers rootes, Harts tong, Asarabacca, Lupines, Cipers rootes, and Endiue, of each one quarter of an ounce, Epithymum half a dragm, Barly, Prunes, Violets, of each three dragmes: let them seeth all together. Lastly, put the Epythimum and one quarter of Sene leaues vnto it: then seethe it vntil the third part be decocted. Then take foure ounces of this decoction, and temper therein halfe an ounce of fresh Cassie, beaten pils, of Azure stone one scruple: last of all temper it together vnto a potion. But if the patient had rather vse pils, then take pils De Lapide Armeno or Indo, one dragme at one time. The Lupins sodden alone in water, should be also good for this. But if this hardening of the Milt be of wind and cold, as it otherwhiles befalleth, it is there∣by to be perceiued: to wit, if one presse vpon it, that then the wind will rumble. For this, amongst other things, may be giuen Trocisci de Capparis, and to let the sicke bodie drinke old Wine: but water must he wholly forbeare. But if one will vse water with it, then is the same first to be steeled, and all his drinke to be tempered with it, or any of these things following to be decocted in it, as Rue, Costus rootes, Cinnamom, Annis, Spica of Indy, Squinant, &c. We haue also a litle before declared, how that Ammoniacum is to be vsed: for this is also good rosted Millet, Salt, and Comin layd warme vpon it. Item, boxing cups vnpickt set vpon the Milt. But if it be discerned, that there be any moisture in the Milt (which may be perceiued by rumbling, if it be wrung hard) then is the patient to be purged, as aforesaid. For this, is also good the sirupe of Acetosus Compositus, and this fomentation following is to be vsed with it: Take Annis, Fennell, Caraway, wild Thyme, Violets, floures of Burrage, Calmus, the roots of blew Flower-deluce, and Agrimonie, of each one ounce, Cammomill one ounce and a halfe: let them séeth all together in Vineger, and wet a sponge in this decoction, and kéepe it very warme vpon the Milt before meate; afterwards lay one of these foresaid plaisters vpon it. Aboue all those which we haue hitherto rehearsed, there be yet mo good things, whereof we will first discouer the simples, as namely, Agaricus, which doth open al obstructions of the Milt and other parts, Sene leaues, Epithymus, and black Hellebore, or Néesewoort, The compounded medicines be Pilulae Indae, whereof we haue spoken so often, which are worthy to be described here, which be prepared as followeth. Take Mirobalani Indi, blacke Néesewoort, and Polipody rootes, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Thymus, Epithymus, Stechas, of each thrée dragmes, Agaricus, washt Azure stone, Colo∣quint, Indy salt, or Sal gemmae, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cloues half a dragme, powder of Hiera Picra Galeni, three quarters of an ounce, the iuice of Smallage as much as suffiseth for to make a masse of pils. These pils are good for all melancholicke accidents, for the Canker, for the Leapry, for all incurable blacke Impostumes, for all heauines of mind, the quartain Ague, yellow Iaundise, diseases of the Milt, and such like. One may take a dragme at once of these pils. Item, take tenne dayes together the powder of Fearne rootes one dragme and a halfe,
augmenting it still from day to day, to the waight of one dragme and a halfe. Other do take of this foresaid powder one dragme, and of the pils Agregatiuae halfe a drag. and temper them together. Item, take the iuice of Wormwood foure ounces, Sugar as much as you please, and so vse it ten dayes one after another. It is also not onely good for the Milt, but also for the yellow Iaundise; as also for all moisture of the Lyuer, and for the dropsie. Item, for all hardnesse and swelling of the same, being tempered with Vineger and so drunken. Maister Tristrams water is also very méete for all diseases of the Milt, like as be also the most of all golden waters which be described in the eight part. Item, take Roses and Barber∣ries, of each three dragmes, burnt Iuorie, Wormwood, Cuscuta, Licorice, Mastick, and Squi∣nant, of each one dragme and a halfe, Endiue séede, Fennell, Annis, Spica, Agrimonie, Opium, Asarabacca rootes, Costus rootes, péeled Gourd séed, and Cucumber seedes, of each halfe a drag. then make Trociskes thereof with Endiue water. They be especiall good for the Milt, and also for the Liuer. For potions, he may take of these things following what he desireth: as namely, both kinds of Chamedryos, Harts toung, Maidenhaire, Sene leaues, Capers rootes, Tamarlske, rootes of Parsley, Smallage, Fennell, Cinnamom, Licorice, Currans, Annis, Fennell water, and of Caraway, wherein Thymus, and Epithymus be decocted. The order of Diet. THis patient is to beware of cloudie and foggie weather, and of hard and grosse meates: his bread must be well baked, and be a day or two stale, but vn∣leauened bread is not good for him: also Annis, Coriander, and Fennell, are to be baked in his bread. All field fowles, as Phesants, Partridges, yong and old turtle Doues, Kids, young Mutton drest with vineger, he may eate well, as al∣so rere Egges. Of all other herbs these are good for him: Mints, Parsly, Fennell, Garlick, Léekes, all kind of Cresses, Sage, Hyssope, Radish, Endiue, Agrimonie, red Pease, and the first decoction of red Colewoorts. He must also eate oftentimes Annis, Comin, Dill séed, Fennell seed, and the séeds of Sesamum, Capers, Tamarisks, bitter Almonds, the kernels of Peach stones, and of Che∣rie stones: for this is also good, the losinges of Comin, and of Annis. The milts of swine are al∣so to be eaten for the curing of the disease of the milt, and also the milt of a sound horse dried and beaten to powder the waight of a dragme, take of it with strong wine: for it is in like ma∣ner very requisite for this purpose. But if so be that there be no heate, then may he chuse some of these things following for to drinke: First, wine is not onely permitted for this hardnes of the Milt, but also highly com∣mended. Also all famous Phisitions do aduise, that the patient must eate and drinke in the wood of Tamariske: for they say that onely hereby many be holpen who haue gone twentie yeares with a hard Milt. But if this Tamariske wood cannot be gotten, then are the shauings thereof to be taken and laid in his drinke. And if so be that one can continue this forty dayes together, then he shall euidently see amendement. Ash wood doth the same, which hath also the power of the Tamariske: Of Wines, white wine is alwaies most commended: if it be too strong then is it to be allayed with water that is stéeled, or with raine water, or the water of Harts toung. You haue also hereafter two kinds of good wines, which may be prepared for this vse. Take Sene leaues, Balme, Maidenhaire, and the rinds of Tamariske, of each sixe hand∣fuls, Polypodie rootes foure handfuls, prepared Coriander thrée ounces, Guaiacum foure oun∣ces, eight or ten Nutmegs, Cloues halfe an ounce, Galingall one ounce and a halfe, Citron pils one handfull, shauings of Ash wood as much as is néedfull, at the most sixtéene quarts: make then an hearbed wine thereof, and let the patient drinke the first draught thereof in the morning and euening. Another: Take the rootes of Cicorie, rinds of Tamariske, Harts tong, and the middle rinds of the Ash wood, of each one handfull: powre ten pots of Must, or some other good wine, and vse thereof as before. And all other herbed wines which may be made, are at this present praised for the Milt: as wine of Eyebright, wine of Tamariske, each made by it selfe, or both together. Item, wine of
Hyssope, of Marioram, and of Wormwood, do warm the Milt and all inward parts: the wine of Gilloflowers, and of Betonie is also good for this. Item, the Aromaticall wine, & mo other spiced wins, and also the wine of Asarabacca. Reasonable exercise before meales is also much commended: and sometimes to bath in water wherein the foresaid herbes be decocted. To the contrarie, he must eschue all troubled wines, as Must, Syder, and Beere: for all such do not only obstruct the Milt, but also the Lyuer, the Lights, and Kidneys: which obstructions be causes of many sicknesses. For this disease is also hurtfull Swines flesh, Milke, Chéese, Rice, Starch, Pease, Beanes, Seruices, Peares, Medlars, Quinces, Chestnuts, and Peaches: therefore be they to be re∣frained. We will also note some things, wherewith the sicke partie, and the Milt, with all other in∣ward parts are to be strengthened. Amongst which, is de Miua Cydoniorum aromatica one of the chiefe. Item, this confection following, if that heate and cold be mixed together: Take Venus haire, Harts tong, of each halfe an ounce, Ammoniacum one quarter of an ounce, Tamariscus one ounce, seedes of Agnus castus, and of broad Plantaine, Aristologie rootes, Agrimony, Worm∣wood and Squinant, of each one dragme and a halfe, Laudanum one dragme, séed of Purslaine, Sorrell, Endiue, and wild Endiue, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Oxymel of Squils sixe ounces, water Lillies, Violet séedes, and of Mallowes, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar eight ounces. Séethe the Sugar with Vineger of Squils vntill it be as thicke as hony: when it is cold, then mixe the rest amongst it, with the water of Maiden haire: afterwards séethe it againe with vineger of Squils vntill it be as thick as honie: when it is cold, then mixe the rest amongst it, with the water of Maiden haire. Afterwards, séethe it againe vntill all the water be decocted: when it is then sodden and well brayed, then vse euery morning three dragmes of it. If you had rather drinke it, then temper it with Sorrell water: it is a maruellous good me∣dicine. Another Confection. Take Mirobalani Indi, and Bellirici, floures of Burrage, Buglosse, Ele∣campane roots, and Folefoote leaues, of each one dragm, seedes of Endiue, of Lettice, small En∣diue, and Sorrell, of each one dragme, peeled Melon seede, Pompeon, Cucumbers, and peeled Gourd séedes, of each one dragme and a halfe, Pingles and Pistacia, of each two ounces, sirup of Vineger foure ounces. Sugar thrée ounces, sowre Dates one ounce and a halfe: make a con∣fection thereof, and take thereof euery morning before meate, as much as the quantitie of a Nutmeg. This confection is very forcible to cunsume all melancholicke humors and matters: it openeth the spléene, strengtheneth the stomacke and the heart, and deopilateth also all ob∣structions. Item, Nutmegs, Walnuts, rootes of Eringus, and Elecampane, all confected, be very méete for this disease. Amongst the Conserues, are the Conserues of Betonie, of Gilloflowers, of Lauander, of Spike, of Marioram, Sage, Hyssope, Eyebright, and of Fumitorie, and all that may be made of these foresaid herbs very good. Likewise also both the Treacles, and Mithridate. Item, you haue more in the first part, the 12. Chapter, and first §. a good grosse powder which is méete for this. Capers eaten with Vineger, rootes of Smallage with the herbe, and Dill, are also good. And let this suffise for the order of Diet. Here followeth now what is outwardly to be vsed. THis powder following is alwaies about the fourth day to be strewed vpon the head the weight of foure graines; and one may vse it with much furtherance as long as he li∣ueth: Take Roses, burnt Iuorie, white and red Corall, of each one scruple, Mace foure scruples, Cloues halfe a dragme, Lignum Aloes two scruples, then make a small beaten pow∣der with it. A bag for the breast: Species de Xilo Aloes, Laetificans Almanforis, of each fiue dragmes: put these in a red crimson silk bag, and weare it on the left breast. Concerning the oyles and salues are these most méete: Oyle of Brickes is very good for all diseases of the spléene. Item, the oyle of Bayberries, of bitter Almonds, of Spikenard, of Wormwood, Galingall, and of Capers. For all kinds of Salue may you make this following: vz. oyle of Lillies, Almonds, Capers,
and the marrow of all kind of beasts, Saffron, Vineger, Gum, Waxe, muscilage of Hollihocke rootes, of Linseede, and of Fenegréeke séede. The salue of Hollihocke rootes, Vnguentum Altheae, (which is well knowne to all Apothe∣caries) is also highly commended for this disease, the description whereof immediatly ensueth: Take the rootes of Mallowes, of Hollihockes, of Lillies, Onions, Squils, Linseede, Fenegreeke seede, Figs, and Raisins, of each halfe an ounce: powne them all together, and then steepe it a whole night in strong Vineger: afterwards séeth them all in water, and then stampe it to pap. This being done, mingle therwith the salue of Althea two ounces, Ducks grease, Calues mar∣row, and vnsalted butter, of each one ounce, oyle of sweet Almonds foure ounces, Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make a salue. For this is also good the salue Marciaton, and Cerotum de Hyssopo Philagrij. This following is a speciall good salue for the Spléene: Take the iuice of wild Cucumbers, and of Swines bred, of each foure ounces, put them in a glasse, and the salue of Althea, oyle of Capers, and fresh Butter, of each two ounces; let them seethe the space of foure houres in hote water: strayne it afterwards through a cloth, and afterwards put Ammoniacum vnto it dissolued in the iuice of Swines bred one quarter of an ounce, Waxe as much as is néedefull for to make a salue ther∣with. And because that this salue cannot be made euery where by reason of the iuice, this follow∣ing may be vsed: Take oyle of swéet Almonds sixe ounces, Neats féete oyle two ounces, fresh Butter one ounce, the iuice of Bryonie and Tamariske, of each two ounces: put this in a spe∣ciall pot, and let it seethe in boyling water vnto the halfe: put afterwards vnto it the rootes of Capers, Tamariske, Agnus castus, and Harts tong, of each one quarter of an ounce, molten white Waxe one ounce: then make a salue of it. Another. Take oyle of Capers thrée ounces, Cammomill one ounce and a halfe, Harts tong, rootes of Capers, Endiue, wild Endiue, and Lettice seede, of each halfe a dragme, séeds of Agnus castus, and Waxe, as much as suffiseth for to make a plaister or salue: lastly, stirre a litle Vineger amongst it. This salue is very good for the Milt in hote and also in cold causes: it mol∣lifieth all hardnesse, expelleth all winds and all impostumes of the same. Now for to lay somewhat vpon it, boyle Rue in strong Vineger, and make a woollen cloth wet in it: wring out the same, and so lay it warme ouer it. Item, there standeth the like a litle before: Take the roots of Mallowes, &c. and that which is written shortly after it, euen to the salue Althea, and what further followeth: séethe them all in water of Cammomill, and lay it warme with a bag ouer the Milt: it helpeth maruellous well. Take Oxymel sixe ounces, Caper rootes one ounce, Wormwood halfe an ounce, beate them small together: afterwards make a woollen clout wet in it, and lay it so vpon it. Hereafter follow certaine plaisters: Take Ammoniacum thrée quarters of an ounce, Bdellium one ounce and a halfe: dissolue them in vineger of Squils, Tamariscus halfe a dragme, Harts toung, Dill seede, and Agnus castus séede, of each two scruples, broad Plantaine séede halfe a dragme, Waxe one quarter of an ounce, and Rosin as much as is néedfull therewith to make a plaister. Another: Take Tamariscus, Harts toung, séede of Agnus castus, and of broad Plantaine, of each two scruples, Ammoniacum and Bdellium, of each thrée dragmes. You are to dissolue both these Gums in vineger of Squils, and when they be cold, then mixe the other things amongst it, beaten smal. The same doth also the Ammoniacum alone dissolued in sharp vineger, and spred vpon a cloth and so layed thereon. Other do dissolue this Gum in the iuice of Swines bred, for then it is more forcible, as is herebefore admonished. Item, take oyle of Lillies, also of the flowers of blew Flowers de luce, & of Capers, of each one ounce, Barly meale, Lineséed meale, and Fenegréeke meale, of each one dragme, Bdellium, Ammoniacum, Galbanum, of each one dragme and a halfe, Opopanacum, Myrrhe and Frankinsence, of each halfe a dragme. Make this all together with molten Waxe and Rosin vnto a plaister, then spred it vpon a cloth, & vse it as all the rest. Item, take Rue leaues one quarter of an ounce, Boreas and Nep, of each thrée dragmes, Ammoniacum seuen dragmes, dissolue them in old Wine, and make a plaister of it, it mollifieth, healeth, and expelleth windines. Or take Ammoniacum, Bdellium, and Pitch of each one ounce and a halfe, Trociscos de Capparis, white Mustard séede, Sulphur, wild Garlicke, and
Cow dung, of each one dragme, Muscilage of Fenegréeke, and of Linséede, of each one quarter of an ounce: powne all them that be to be powned: then first dissolue the Gum in strong vine∣ger, and worke them one amongst another: but first of all annoint your hands with the oyle of Barberries. Another: Take the muscilage of Fenegreeke, and of Lineséede, of each one ounce, the grease of Hens, Geese, and Duckes, of each thrée ounces, washt Butter, Swines grease, Neates féet oyle, of each one quarter of an ounce, beaten Tamariscus, Willow leaues, Harts toung, the middle rind of the Ash trée, Capers rootes, Rue leaues, and Nep, of each one dragme, oyle of Capers one ounce and a halfe, a litle Waxe and Vineger: then make a plaister or salue of it. Item, take an Onion, cut off a peece at the top, and make it hollow within, and fill it with oyle of Lillies, and let it rest vncouered in the ashes, so long till it haue soked vp all the oyle: afterwards stampe it, and lay it warme ouer it. All these plaisters following are also good for it: as namely, De Meliloto, Diachilon magnum, De Muscilaginibus, and others. Take of the plaister De Muscilaginibus two ounces, Ammoniacum dissolued in Vineger, and Marcasite beaten small, of each fiue dragms: temper it on the fire, and spread it on a leather cut after the fashion of a halfe Moone, and so lay it warme vpon the spléene, it is very good, and approued. We haue promised herebefore to describe the salues of Dialthea. It is also made after sundrie fashions, like as we shall also teach here: Take cleane Hollihock rootes eight ounces, Linséede and Fenegréeke séede, of each foure ounces, Sallad oyle sixtéene ounces, Turpentine halfe an ounce, Rosin one ounce and a halfe: the rootes and also the seedes shall you steepe three dayes and three nights in a quart of water; the fourth day seeth them so long, vntill they yeeld from them a thicke tough slime or muscilage: wring them hard out, and take eight ounces thereof, and seeth it with the oyle vntil all the moisture be decocted. Afterwards put the Turpentine, Rosin, and foure ounces of Waxe vnto it. When all these things be molten and well tempered, then take it from the fire, and stirre it well about vntill it be cold. The second: Take eight ounces of faire sliced Hollihocke rootes, Linseede, and Fenegreeke, seed, of each foure ounces, stampe them, and wring them thorough as before: then put vnto it foure ounces of Barrowes grease, two beaten Onions, one ounce and a half of Gummi Arabi∣cum, and let them seeth all together vntill that all the moisture be decocted: afterwards take foure ounces of molten Waxe, and then temper them together, and stirre it well about vntill it be through cold. The third: Take faire cleansed Hollihocke rootes twelue ounces, choppe it very small, and powre two quarts of water into it, sixe ounces of Linseed, three ounces of Fenegreeke seed, and three ounces of Lilly rootes: then powne them all together, and when they be boyled to a tough slime or muscilage, then straine them thorough a cloth, and take twelue ounces of it, and séeth the same with 24. ounces of Barrowes grease vntill the iuice be all decocted: afterwards put vnto it foure ounces of Waxe, Fenegreeke meale two ounces, Galbanum dissolued in Vineger, Gummi Hederae, and Turpentine, of each one ounce. But if you cannot get the foresaid Gum, then take three ounces of Turpentine, & temper them all together as before: this salue is good for all swellings, for the shrinking of the sinewes, for all tumors of the breasts: it looseth phlegme, asswageth the Cough and all stitches in the sides, as also the paine in the Raynes, of the grauell, and is good for all extenuations. The fourth and last: Take fresh Hollihocke rootes twelue ounces, Linseede and Fenegreeke seede, of each sixe ounces, Squilles three ounces, Sallad oyle 24. ounces, yellow Waxe sixe ounces, Turpentine, Gummi Hederae, and Galbanum, of each one ounce and a quarter, Colophonia and Rosin, of each three ounces: powne all that is to be powned, and let it steepe together three dayes in water: afterwards seeth them all together, and straine them thorough a cloth, and then take foure and twenty ounces of the muscilage thereof, and let them seeth all together on a soft fire with the foresaid oyle vntill all the moisture be decocted: afterwards put Waxe vnto it, and then a little of the Gumme, and lastly the Colophonie and Rosin. When it is boyled ynough, then stirre it well about, and let it coole.
Of the Melancholia and moisture of the Spleene. §. 5. FOr as much as the Spléene (as is said) is the true receptacle of the blacke and melancholicke bloud; therfore reason requireth that we should write of what na∣ture the same is, whereby other things may also be discerned which be incident to the Milt. First, we haue in the first part, the 12. chap. and 8. §. described many kinds of causes of Melancholy, and in other places moe, especially in the begin∣ning of the former §. and taught of the Milt, of her beginning, causes, & what hurt might pro∣céede thereof: to wit, if the same got the masterie, that there may follow not onely heauines of mind, frighting, and such like: but also it might depriue the whole body of his liuely colour, and cause also black vlcers, leaprie, the canker, quartaine agues, and such like: and lastly, all manner of distraction of the mind, raging madnes, and inhumane beastlinesse. Therefore, be∣cause this booke euery where maketh mention of them, it is not néedfull to discourse more at large thereof at this present. But we will onely describe certaine remedies which be fit for it. Wherefore it is first to be noted, that all preparatiue and purgatiue things are to be vsed, that the matter may be auoyded through going to the stoole, and not through vomiting, by rea∣son that these melancholick humors are very ponderous and heauie, and will not be expelled but onely downwards. Before we then come to any particular remedies, we will first discouer what simples there be that do prepare these melancholicke humors, and whereby the same may be expelled, viz. Burrage, Buglosse, Thymus, Epithymus, Capers rootes, Tamariscus, Harts tong, good Wine, ba∣thing in swéet Water, Licorice, Currans, Polipody rootes, grasse, Chamedryos, Cuscuta, Asarabac∣ca, Gentian, Lupines, Fumitorie, Calmus, Spicanardi, Agnus castus, bitter Almonds, Cicorie, Rosemarie, Radish séede, Burnet, sea Crabs, and aboue all a chearefull courage or light hart. The compounded medicines are Oxymel of Squils, hony of Roses, sirupe of Vineger, Siru∣pus acetosus, compositus de Fumo terrae, and other moe. But chiefly this following is to be prepa∣red for it: Take Cicorie, Rosemarie, Burnet, Hops, Cincfoile, Endiue with the roots, Fumito∣rie, the rootes of Buglosse, Burrage flowers, Liuerwoort, Chamedryos, field Cipers, Capers rootes, Tamariscus rootes, and Harts toung with the roots, of each two ounces, Prunes, and Se∣bestes, of each twentie or fiue and twenty, Sene leaues, Cuscuta, Thymus, wild Thyme, and Fennell of each halfe an ounce, Licorice, Raisins, Stechas, of each two ounces; Séeth them all together in thrée pints of water euen to the halfe: adde to this decoction (being strained) Bu∣glosse, and the iuice of Prunes, of each eightéene ounces, Sugar foure and twenty ounces, Ho∣nie of Roses sixe ounces: let them seeth to a sirupe. These things following are reputed for such as expell Melancholie and do purge, viz. Epi∣thymus, Mirobalani Indi, Chebuli, Polypody roots, prepared Esulus, Bolus, mountain Mints, Cas∣sie, Sene leaues, Fumitory, Hony suckles, Hops, blacke Néesewoort, Indy salt, wild Saffron séeds, Sal gemmae. The compounded medicaments are Diasena, Hiera Ruffi, Hiera logodion, and such like. Item, take Sene leaues, Thymus, Epithymus, Cuscuta, and Burrage flowers, of each one ounce, Annis, Fennell, and Smallage séed, of each halfe an ounce, Harts tong, Maiden haire, Chamedryos, and Agrimonie, of each one handfull; let them all séeth well, and take thereof foure ounces; steepe therein Mirobalani Indi, halfe an ounce, and Chebuli thrée dragmes all the night: afterwards straine it well out, and temper therewith Diasena, thrée dragmes, Cassia one ounce, washt azure stone two scruples: giue the same vnto him in the morning, and there may lesse thereof be giuen at once. When as melancholie appeareth, then is the Liuer veine to be opened; for that surpasseth al other things: and the same is to be done more then once, and that alwaies according to the abilitie and strength of the patient. Item, care must be taken to open the piles, be it with rubbing, with the Launcet, or lastly with Leaches. For this it is also very needfull that this patient be often purged: but he must first alwayes vse some kind of sirupe as is herebefore expressed. Also he must vse according as the cause re∣quireth, the sirupe of Burrage, of Buglosse, Apples, de Epithymo, and Diarrhodon, of Cicorie, Wormwood, of Roses, hony of Roses, Oxymel, and sirupe of Vineger. And for to purge, he must take Mirobalani Indi, Chebuli, and Citrini, of each halfe an ounce, the outward rinds of the blacke Néesewoort thrée dragmes; powne them together very small, and
séeth them in sufficient water: straine it, and put into this decoction Epithymum, Thyme, Poli∣podie rootes, and Sene leaues, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, the seedes of Citrons one quar∣ter of an ounce; then seeth them againe vnto the halfe, and so let it stand all a night: afterwards straine it out, and wring it hard, and put as much Sugar vnto it as you thinke méete. This be∣ing done, seeth it againe, and clarifie it with the white of an Egge. Lastly, temper amongst it the sirupe of Citron pils one ounce, and drinke foure or fiue ounces of it early in the morning. But this is here to be noted, that if this sirupe be giuen to any bodie that is infected with the Poxe, the same partie is first to be purged with the confection called Lenitiua, mixing with it thrée dragmes Confectionis Hamech. Afterwards, giue vnto him this Sirupe following, and then the decoction of Guaiacum, whereof we shall write hereafter more at large. This patient must often before meate take Cassia, for it cleanseth the bloud, and taketh away the sharpnes of it. For this, are méete also the Pillulae Indae Aggregatiuae, and De Lapide Lazuli. Item, Sene leaues steeped in Henbroth, strewed with a little Cinnamom; or Sene leaues stéeped in Whay. Item, the same boyled with the flowers of Burrage, of Buglosse, of Balme, and with the rootes of Parsly. The Sene leaues may also be stéeped with Wormwood and with Wine: and it is good du∣ring the space of a whole moneth alwaies euery other day, to drinke two or three ounces of the decoction or infusion of Sene leaues, both which are described in the eleuenth Chapter the 20. §. and temper amongst it two ounces of the laxatiue sirupe of Roses: the decoction of Sene leaues as much: vse this fasting. You haue also herebefore a powder for to purge melancholy, and two kinds of Confections, Diaturbith, cum Rhabarbaro. Item, whay wherein Epithymus hath bene infused, or Polypody rootes haue bene decocted, doth more prepare to purge. How the melancholicke bloud is to be purged. §. 6. AMongst all these foresaid medicins, there be diuers which do cleanse the bloud. And the drift of all Phisitions in this sicknes is, that all the heauie, blacke, and vncleane bloud might be purged, diminished, and corrected. Howbeit, there is somewhat else which is here to be signified: to wit, for this doth Venus or Maidenhaire first serue, that educeth all bad humours and slime out of the Li∣uer, maketh good colour, lengtheneth the breath, cleanseth the stomacke, the lyuer, and the milt, and also breaketh the stone. Item, take the whay of Goats milke, stéepe Fumitorie in it, or mixe the iuice of the hearbe amongst it, and drinke of it certaine dayes ensuing other at each time a good draught: or in the steade thereof, take the Sirupe or Conserue of the same hearbe, for both of them be very good. Also, make pils of powned Masticke, and the iuice of Wormwood. There be also certaine Wines for the cleansing of the bloud prepared, as hereafter ensueth: Take Currans three common pounds, Maidenhaire fiue ounces and one quarter of an ounce, black prepared Hellebore two ounces and a halfe, and one dragme of Polipodie, and Hermo∣dactili, of each foure ounces, prepared Coriander, and Sene leaues, of each fiue ounces and one dragme and a halfe, Pockwood sixe pound, rinds of the same eightéene ounces. These being all well beaten together, then powre thereon two almes of Must, and halfe an alme of Well water: then let them stand and worke together at the fire about sixe dayes space, stirring it wel euery day about. When it is setled the space of three dayes, and fallen downe, then straine it out cleare, and keepe it vntill occasion serue to vse it. Of this foresaid wine must the patient drinke at meales in the stead of other wine the space of two moneths, or at least euery other day. This openeth the bodie very easily, and therwith expelleth all grosse humors and Cholera out of the bodie. And if this wine cannot be brooked by it selfe, then may the same be tempered with other common wine drunken moderately. It expelleth melancholy, and all heauinesse of mind: it maketh merrie, and of good cheare. In like maner of all herbe wines these are highly cōmended for this sicknes: viz. wine of Bur∣rage, Buglosse, and of Harts toung, and of Tamariske; which not onely take away melancho∣lick humors, but do withstand the quartaine Ague which is caused by them.
Of Confections you may vse Diarrhodon Abbatis, Aromaticum Rosatum, and Dyanthos. Likewise Conserue of Violets, of Roses, of Buglosse, and of Rosemarie. Treacle and Mi∣thridate, taken the waight of one dragme, is very commodious for this: for that they do both diminish melancholie, and take away the heauines of the mind, feare, and such like, that may procéed of Melancholy. The confected Citron pils do repugne all melancholicke accidents. Confected Nutmegs do make fresh bloud. For meates in stead of other sauce, Sugar is to be vsed. We haue before discouered, that bathing in swéet water is very profitable. So are also box∣ing cups set vnpickt vpon the sides, whereby to extract all windinesse. You are also to vse the grosse powder, which in the first Part, the 12. Chapter, and 1. §. is de∣scribed, which is ordained for the memorie. The fifteenth Chapter. Of the Bowels or Guts. LIke as we haue hitherto described the Stomacke, the Liuer, the Gall, and the Spléene, and made full declaration thereof: so will we now dis∣course of the next adiacent parts, before that we come to the Kidneys: to wit, of the bowls or guts, and all that concerneth them. We affirme then that beneath the stomack the Bowels haue their beginning, which are parted in sixe parts. The three first and vppermost are very subtill & thin; for which cause they be called in Latine Gracilia intestina, into the which one part of ye digested meats are conueyed. The other thrée sorts of the bowels be the vndermost, which are more thicker & fleshlier than the three vppermost, whereby the sharpnesse and hardnes of the Stercora should the lesse bruse them. And these sixe sorts of bowels haue their name giuen them by reason of their greatnesse, and property of their operations, and not for that they be sixe seuerall things: for they hold fast one vpon another, so that they may rightly be taken for one Gut, which is placed in the belly after a wonderfull manner with many kind of crookes and windings about, and reacheth from the stomacke euen to the fundament. And to speake particularly thereof, the first which begin∣neth at the stomacke is called of the Latinists Duodenum, and that for this cause, because it is twelue fingers breadth long. The second (which Galenus calleth the first) they do name Ieiu∣num, which is the emptie gut, because it is alwaies emptie. This gutte hath some crookes and turnings: afterwards, it doth reach foorth straight out euen to the Lyuer. The third is by the Grecians called Ileon, and by the Latinists Voluulus, which is the winding gut; not only for that by his length it twisteth and windeth about, but also for this cause (as the learned write) be∣cause there be ingendred in this gut great Chollicke and gripings, which do draw hither and thitherwards through their great pains, as now in one, and then in an other place they be most violently perceiued. Thus are these thrée (as is said) thinne and subtill of substance, differing onely herein, that Ileon is not found alwaies emptie, like as the two former. The fourth gutte which they do call Coecum, that is, the blind, and Monoculum, being the annexed gutte, which they do call Coecum, for that it seemeth that it hath but one going out or issuing: whereas not∣withstanding the Anatomists do attribute twaine vnto it: we will call it also the bag, for that it is like to a fat stomacke: yet somewhat lesse, and better to receiue all that must be auoyded through going to stoole. The fift is Colon, and by the Latinists called Crassum intestinum. This gut is fleshier than any of all the rest: also of a reasonable length & crookednes, in the which, and especially in the end of it, the meate is conuerted to dung: which (before and ere that it is di∣gested) the learned do call Chylum. In this foresaid gut doth the Cholicke properly ingender. The last gut is Intestinum rectum, which is the Arsegut, that is called Longanum, for that it doth not crooke, and stretcheth to the end of the fundament. These are now the lower guts, and they be otherwhiles called the lower belly. But what each sort of these bowels haue for a nature, propertie, power, vertue and operation, were here to long, and contrary to our purpose to de∣cipher, because we do not here thinke to discourse of any thing, but onely the cures of the disea∣ses that the bowels or guts are subiect vnto.
Of the paine and griping of the Guts in generall. §. 1. IN both these sorts of the guts come great outward gripings, stitches, & paine, whereof there be two sorts: the one Iliaca, the other Cholica, Iliaca is in the vp∣permost small guts, and Cholica in the vndermost bowels: which sorts of pains or stitches receiue their names of the bowels, or the bowels of these foresaid gripings or sicknes. And because that in both these sorts of paines of the bow∣els the remedies are alike, whereas in other diseases they be greatly differing, therefore we will treate of both these seuerally. Afterwards we will also determine of the Wormes in the bowels, of all other diseases which are to be ascribed to the bowels, as of al the scourings, of bloudie flixe, and obstructions, &c. wherof we haue heretofore discoursed, &c. where be many kinds of things to be found for the paine of the guts. Of the vppermost paine and griping of the Guts Iliaca Passio, which the common man calleth Cholica. §. 2. ILeos, or Iliaca Passio, are gripings or stitches in the vppermost small guts, which be caused of some obstruction or swellings of the guts, wherby the congested filth or corruption cannot fall downe into the great guts: whereby such great intollerable paine, sicknesse, and gripings do insue, that the guts séeme to be bored thorough with a bodkin, and that commonly with a continuall vomiting and parbraking: yet not in all pa∣tients. Therefore, if so be that this paine, pricking, and obstruction do get the maisterie; then doth there follow it a stinking belching, yea a parbraking of all filthinesse and of ordure through the mouth, and that by reason that the stopping beneath is so great, that neither ordure nor wind can euacuate beneath: neither can it be opened through Clisters, whereby it must needes fol∣low, that all the belchings do draw the wind and filth vpwards, and must lastly be auoyded through the mouth. Certaine learned men do dispute of these causes, and that not without reason: for some do thinke, that it is not the right ordure which is eiected by the mouth, but that it should be only a certaine filthy and corrupted meate which lyeth stinking in the stomacke, because the same cannot be expelled: but be it how it will, this sicknes is neuertheles so terrible and pain∣ful, that certaine ancient Phisitions do call the same Domine miserere, Lord haue mery vpō me. And it is a grieuous sicknes indéed: for besides all that is said, if it come with a great heate, then it doth commonly cause an impostume in the bowels, whereby commeth the crampe, and the contracture of the sinewes, so that the sick person therby doth lose his senses & runneth mad. These and other signes which shall hereafter follow, are so deadly, that scarcely euer any one recouereth his health againe. The common people which haue no vnderstanding of naturall things which pertaine to mans bodie, do call this Iliaca, the Mother in men, like as the common people in Italy do cal it Paron, which is, Father, whereas notwithstanding men haue no mother in them. The causes of this Iliaca passio, are inward and outward, the outward may be through fals, thrusts or strokes on these places: or through drinking of much cold water, through much bin∣ding, grosse meates, as hard Chéese, Cow béefe, or any other hard flesh which is not well sod∣den or rosted, salt Porke, and principally of ill boyled wood Pigeons, or meates which he swal∣lowed downe not well chewed. Item, there be mo things which be hurtfull for this sicknes; as Pease, Beanes, Medlars, Quinces, Seruises, Peares, Sloes, and such like binding fruites. For this paine of the belly is commonly more rife in haruest, when fruites are found most a∣boundant, than at any other time of the yeare. These sicknesses may also be caused of cold and piercing winds, as the Northren winds: as also to the contrarie, out of great heate and great labour: and lastly, through venime taken: The inward causes commonly procéede from other parts: as if there be any impostume present, whether it be in the Bowels or in the Lyuer, or in the sucking veines called Ʋenae Mesaraicae, in the Kidneys, or in the Bladder, or when the Bowels thorough some vapour fall downe into the priuities. If so be that the
cause be in the bowels, thereof there be sixe: to wit, if the gut Ileon or Colon be too hot or too cold, or be fraughted with any cold tough matter, or through wind, or obstructed with some hard cor∣ruption, or when the bowels be full of wreathed wormes: lastly, this disease may also be cau∣sed through faintnesse of the expulsiue or strength of the retentiue vertue. Concerning the signes, they may be demaunded of the sicke persons or standers by. But if there be any impostume in any other parts, it may be knowne by the place affected where the impostume is. The hote impostumes of the guts are discerned by the continuall agues, thirst, & panting or beating of the same part; whereas to the contrarie the cold impostumes be without great paine and without agues, but onely with a kind of heauines and tumor: and these com∣monly assaile a man that is accustomed to vse much cold and moist meates, as milke, fish, and such like. If this sicknes be caused through the obdurated corruption of the bowels, then is there with it an extreame pain, so that it seemeth to the patient that his bowels are cut vp, and that chiefly if he haue taken before any such things as may cause these bindings, and harden the filth or corruption, as inward or outward heate, and through vse of drie things. Or if this disease come through wind, then doth the paine depart from one place vnto another, with a kind of rumbling, and that with such stitches, as if the bowels were prickt through with auls. And if the same be caused of cold slime, then be cold rheumes felt, and such like in the bowels, and that chiefly through certaine meates taken, which do increase Phlegma. Of the paine or griping of the guts, which is called Cholica. §. 3. COlon, or Cholica Passio, is a paine of the bowels, to wit (as is before discoursed) of the neathermost guts, which is caused, when the superfluitie which nature is enured to, naturally to auoyd and cast from her, is stopt and hindered, and if the corruption, winds, or wormes be not expelled, as they were wont to be. But the paine of the cholick cometh commonly by fits, ceasing otherwhiles, and then immediatly returning with great intolerable paine, with heauie breath, with shiuering, shaking and sweating. The causes of this cholick are for ye most part the same with Iliaca Passio: for both of these sorts of paines in the guts be matched so neare together, that they may well be called sisters. But there is onely this difference betwéene them both, that the neathermost bowels be fat by nature, and therfore may gather fatnes vnto them, that by that meanes the guts are made so narrow, that the hard ordure cannot passe thorough them, but is vtterly hindered. The signes of the Cholick be these: when the ordure and winds are daily shut vp and hin∣dred. And although the stoole be furthered through Clisters, or some other meanes, yet is the ordure neuerthelesse hard and burnt, as Sheepes dung, or Goats dung, whereby the naturall appetite doth abate from day to day, vntill it be vtterly lost. Thence followeth then so great paine and gripings about the Nauell, that it seemeth that the guttes be knit or haled together with strings, or pluckt asunder, and bored through with bodkins. As often as one stirreth him, or turneth from one side to the other, then doth the paine increase vehemently in this sicknes; the patient is alwaies gréedie of sowre and sharpe things, and hath a loathing of all that is fat. Each humor whereof this paine is caused, is knowne by these signes following: If it be cau∣sed of Phlegma, then is the same with paine, heauinesse, and desire of all warmth. The paine is to be knowne by the féeling. Old folkes, and such as be flegmaticke by nature, are most of all subiect to this passion. Also the winter, eating of much fish, of much fruite, and of much milke, excessiue rioting, and great quietnesse, much going into the water, and such like, be to this sick∣nes a great cause. If in case that this sicknesse be caused through heate, then is there a great in∣flammation, and with it drouth of the tong, great thirst, itch, & great heate in the vrine. Chiefly if the person be young, and in the Sommer time, if he be chollerick by nature, if he haue vsed much about the fire, or much spice. Or if this paine of the bowels be caused through obstruction it may be knowne by the going to the stoole, and paine of the guts, to wit, as if the same were torne asunder, and stucke thorough. And if the patient would go to the stoole with great force∣ment, then is it all to be auoyded very like to clay, the which may be caused through long vse of any old meate, through the patients drie complexion, and through long continuing labour, and with much sweating in the hote ayre.
Or if this Cholicke proceed through wind, then is heard much rumbling in the bowels and puffing vp of the belly, his excrements do swim vpon the water because they be full of wind: and so much the more may one be ascertained thereof, if one knew that the patient had eaten before much Pease, Beanes, Chestnuts, Rapes, Figs, Must, and such like windie meates or drinkes, much water, or much watered wine. Or when this paine of the bowels is caused of any hote impostumes, then doth the patient féele hote stitches; he hath thirst and great paine, and that alwaies in one place; he hath also a red face, extuberation of the eyes, and restraint of the vrine. But if this griefe be caused through a cold impostume, for it be all these things beforemen∣tioned much féebler: being caused of superfluous meates, of much fish, of much cold and moist herbes, fruites, Swines flesh, and such like: also the stooles be full of Phlegma. Of the difference of these paines in the Guts. §. 4. ABoue all those which are before discouered, be these two sorts of paines in the bowels disagréeing in this; to wit, that in the paine of the vppermost guts, the extremitie is much greater, and can kill a bodie much sooner; for that these vp∣permost, tender and small guts are much more sensible then the neathermost great guts: Secondly, because that Iliaca is vnstedfast (as it is said before) and remooueth from one place into another: Thirdly, because this Iliaca is higher than the nauell. And when this paine setteth there and about the raines, then is it the generall opinion of all the learned, that in no wise, neither through medicins, neither through any other meanes this sharpe matter or wind which hath no vent, lying shut vp in the crooked gut Ilion and there making this paine, may be made to auoide neither yet expelled, and that there will follow of it the Dropsie Tympania, wherein the wind doth after spread it selfe abroad betwéene the skinne and the flesh behind ouer the whole bodie, as hath bene said more at large before in the twelfth Chapter, and sixtéenth §. The fourth difference is, that the vppermost paines of the guts or Iliaca are to be holpen through medicins from aboue, and the vndermost paine Cholica, through clisters; for that the Clisters be very commodious for the Cholera, and very little for Iliaca, or nothing at all: Fiftly, if there appeare any other accidents with it, as swowning, trembling of the heart, short breath, much waking, or cold of the outward parts; they be then alwaies the more grieuous in Iliaca then in Cholica: because that it is nearer to the heart, and therefore the more perillous. Now to come to the remedies, we will (according to the custome of the auncient Phisiti∣ons) distinguish these paines of the bowels by fiue seuerall causes, wherof the first is the obstru∣ction or binding of the bodie: the second Phlegma: the third winds: the fourth impostumes: the fift Cholera and heate: but we will here declare for the first certain things that be generally conuenient for both these griefes: the remedies which be ordained and vsed in both these pains of the bowels, are also very méete for either of them; onely (as it is said) the Clisters for Iliaca passio, do seldome do any good: not that the same be therefore altogether forborne, for both must alwaies be first indeuored to open the passages of the guts, and as soone as one perceiueth the paine, to be presently in hand with clisters, and also to make somewhat readie which may be laid vpon the belly to warme the same therewith, like as with these things following: to wit, Pellitorie of the wall, Mugwoort, Southernwood, Fennell, Elecampane leaues, Worme∣wood, white Mints and Marioram: of these herbes take as many and which you will, put them in a bag, and let them séeth in Wine: afterwards wring them out, and so lay them warm vpon the place of the paine. Item, take Millet or Oates, mixe them with Salt, and a litle Annis, Fennel, Dil, and with Linséede: parch them, and lay them on the paine. You may also make and vse after the same manner a bag with Cammomill, Venus haire and Stechas. Item, take Althea Butter, Bar∣rowes grease, Hens and Ducks grease, of each halfe an ounce, oyle of Cammomill one ounce, annoint the place of the paine with it: what is particularly to be vsed besides for either of these paines in the guts, shall be distinctly shewed hereafter.
Of the paine in the guts through obstruction or binding of the body. §. 5. IN the beginning of this description of the paine in the bowels, when it cometh chiefly through the binding of the bodie, it is to be cured with Clisters, which hereafter be described against winds, and with the purgatiue medicine, wherof diuers be set downe in the eleuenth Chapter, 20. §. And both these are to be vsed so often, and so long, vntill that the bodie be thoroughly opened. In like manner, this patient must indeuor himselfe to eate all soluble meates and herbes, viz. Mallowes, and herbe Mercurie drest with fresh broths, with Butter and Sallad oyle, which for this disease is not onely néedfull, but also much commended. Lay also outwardly vpon it this plaister following: Take Mallowes, Hollihocke rootes, and Bearefoote, of each one handfull, Fenegréeke meale, and Linseede meale, of each sixe oun∣ces, oyle of Violets, Hens grease, Barrowes grease, & fresh Butter, of each two ounces, foure white Lilly rootes rosted. All the herbs are to be sodden, and afterwards stamped, and you are afterwards to temper the rest amongst them ouer the fire, and then to aply them warme vpon it. For this is also very good the sirupe of Violets drunken with some broth wherein Damaske Prunes, Raisins and Figs haue bene decocted, and wherewith some Cassie is tempered. He may also vse the herbes and other things stamped, whereof the Clisters be boyled, and make a plaister thereof with Butter, or oyle of Violets, and with Barrowes grease, and lay it ouer all the belly. He must also eschue cold ayre, and must keepe him alwaies warme, continuing this so long, vntill that ye haue his bodie very open. Of the paine in the guts through slime and Phlegma. §. 6. THe other former discouered cause is Phlegma, which (as is sufficiently shewed before) doth shew it selfe apparantly, if with a tolerable paine there be no great heate nor thirst adioyned. And if there be any salt matter (which the pa∣tient shall perceiue in his mouth) or any obstruction of the bodie, stinking, bel∣ching, and great faintnes with it, then must preparatiue medicines be mini∣stred to the patient, and such as may procure no wambling, and so begin with these Sirupes following: viz. the sirupe of white Mints, of Wormewood, and all sorts of Oxymel, or any such like. Afterwards is much commended by the auncient Phisitions the con∣fection De Gallia for to purge, which followeth hereafter: Take Mastick, Cloues, Ginger, Pep∣per, long Pepper, Cinnamom, Nutmegs, Gallia Muscata, and Diagridion, of each a like quanti∣tie: afterwards wring out the iuice of sowre Quinces, and put as much hony as iuice vnto it: then take of both these one ounce and a half, and put half an ounce of powder vnto it which is made of the foresaid things: but let this iuice and hony séeth before to the thicknes of a sirupe, and afterwards temper the other things amongst it, whereof you are to giue at once one quar∣ter of an ounce or two dragmes and a halfe. Also the purging confections of Quinces, which be described in the eight Part, are very méete for this purpose, and in like sort the Electuarium Indum. A purging Confection: Take Turbith one quarter of an ounce, Ginger one scruple, Ma∣stick halfe a scruple, Sugar three dragmes: temper them well together, and then take it with what you will. But if so be that the sick bodie be not addicted to vomit, and that the same be not feared, then are these Pils following to be exhibited vnto him, called Iliacae. Take Coloquint, and Sagapenum of each ten dragmes, Diagridion, thrée dragmes and one scruple; then make pils of it with wine, and giue therof one dragme at once, they ease very spéedily the paine. For this is also very good Benedicta Laxatiua, or Hiera Picra one ounce, Hiera Picra magnae halfe a dragme, Turbith, and Ginger, of each one scruple: then mixe them together with a good draught of wine. But in case that in this cholick the purging medicins will not helpe, and the sicknes still increaseth, then make these suppositories following: and if so be that these suppositories will not sufficiently relaxe, then are clisters to be vsed, which are the very best and safest remedies for the cholicke which one can deuise, therefore we will here rehearse some of them, and begin first with the mildest. But note alwaies (which is good in all clisters that are to be vsed for the
cholicke) that the herbes, and all that is to be vsed with them, are to be decocted in such broths wherein Calues heades, Lambes heads and feete be boyled: for these broths be very requisite for all obstructions of the bodie. Take Cammomill, Hollihocks, and Mallowes, of each one handfull, Fennell, Annis, Cara∣way, of each one quarter of an ounce: séeth them all together in wine or water. Take fiftéene or sixtéene ounces of this decoction, and dissolue therein fresh Butter, and Sallad oyle, of each two ounces & a halfe, or thrée ounces, with the yolke of an Egge; temper them well, & minister it warme. Item, take one pound of Linséede oyle, and vse it very warme for a Clister: Or take Mallowes, Hollihockes, Béetes, Mercurie, Fenegréeke and Linséede, of each one handfull, fiue or sixe Figs cut, Annis, Fennell, of each one quarter of an ounce, Branne one handfull: seeth them all together in sufficient water. Of this decoction you are to take fiftéene or sixteene oun∣ces; and then temper amongst it Hiera Picra, and Cassie, of each one ounce, oyle of Rue three ounces, and then make a Clister thereof. Another: Take Mallowes, Hollihockes, Mercurie, and Bearefoote, of each one handfull, ten or twelue fat Figs, powned Fenegréeke, and Linséede, of each one ounce and a half, Dil séed one ounce, Bran halfe a handful, oyle of Sesamum, and Hony, of each one ounce and a halfe, Sal gemmae one dragme, Cassie and Hiera Picra, of each thrée quarters of an ounce: temper them all together in sixtéene ounces or more of the foresaid decoction vnto a Clister. You haue before in the eleuenth Chapter, and the 21. §. a Clister of Malmsey, which is also conuenient for this vse. Item, take the iuice of Parietarie, and the iuice of Wormewood, of each sixe ounces, one Nutmeg, Peach kernels beaten very small halfe a dragme, make them all together warme, and minister thrée of these Clisters in one day. Another: Take Annis, and the séede of Pellitorie, of each one quarter of an ounce, Pellito∣rie leaues one handfull: séeth them all together in Wine, and take thereof fiftéene or sixteene ounces: melt Butter therein, and Linséede, of each two ounces, then temper them together. When the patient hath auoyded this Clister, then let him afterwards drink fiue or sixe ounces of the oyle of swéet Almonds, and that tempered with Sugar. Item, take oyle of Rue twelue ounces, fiue or sixe Léekes heads, stampe them, and seeth them in the oyle: then straine it through a cloth, and vse the oyle for a Clister. Item, take Pellitorie, Centorie, Marioram, and field Mints, of each one handfull, Annis, Comin, and péeled wild Saffron seede, of each one dragme, Polipodie rootes, Turbith, and Radish séede, of each halfe an ounce, Sal gemmae one dragme: temper all this into a Clister, as is abouesaid. You are also to obserue here, that these and such like Clisters shall be ministred but onely when other remedies wil not auaile. Item, oyle of Cammomill is more precious then common oyle: but if Cammomill cannot be gotten, then is oyle of Linséede to be vsed in stead of it. Also hereafter do follow sundrie remedies against all paine of the guts, which serue also very well for the Phlegma. Certaine Potions for the cold Phlegma. TAke the rootes of Smallage, Fennell, and Parsly rootes, of each two ounces, Annis, Fennell, Caraway, Parsly, and Smallage séeds, of each one ounce, Radish two ounces: make a decoction of this, and drinke thereof adayes oftentimes as warme as you can suffer it. Also once or twice a day drinke a spoonefull or twaine of Rose hony tempered together with the foresaid potion. Item, séeth an old Cocke vntill the bones fall from the flesh, and in this broth séeth Poli∣podie rootes, the séedes of Dill, and of Annis, and drinke otherwhiles a good draught of it. Also you may oftentimes with the waters and séedes of the foresaid rootes, foment the place where the paine is, and afterwards annoint the place with oyle of Rue wherein Annis séedes are boyled. Some do highly commend the oyle of Sulphur, viz. to drinke in the winter one droppe or twaine with Muscadell wine, or with vitall water. It will maruellously helpe and expell all gripings in the guts of a cold occasion. Item, the confected Elecampane rootes, and confected Pimpernell rootes, do asswage all
paines of the bowels which procéede of cold. In like manner the confected Ginger doth warme and strengthen all inward parts, and so doth also the rootes of Eringus, when it is confected. Amongst other Conserues, there be also méete and commodious the conserues of Piony, and Rosemary, of Hyssop, of Spikenard, and after purging, the Confections of Trion pipereon, Diaca∣lamentha, and such like. Of the paine in the guts through wind. §. 7. THe third cause of these paines in the bowels are winds. If then this paine do come of no obstruction, and yet neuerthelesse one féele cumbling in the belly, & heareth the paine run vp and down in the belly, and if the paine do come by fits, and there abateth againe: against this be those remedies to be vsed that do expell wind. For which, the Confection of Bayberries is so highly cōmended, that it is thought that her like cannot be found. At the Apothecaries they cal this Electuarium de Baccis Lauri, and it is thus prepared: Take drie Rue one dragme, Ameos, Comin, Nardus séede, Louage séede, Marioram, Caraway, bitter Almonds, long Pepper, Daucus seede, white Mints, Pepper, Cal∣mus, Bayberries, and Beuercod, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sagapenum halfe an ounce, O∣popanacum one dragme, all these being powned together and molten, then make a confection of it with clarified hony, and giue the patient thereof the quantitie of an hasell nut with a draught of wine. Marmalade with spices is also very méete for this purpose. Item, in like sort be both the sorts of Treacle and Mithridate, for that they do wast wind, and be good for all cold disea∣ses of the intrailes. Item, there is also fit for this vse the confection of Horseradish, which shall hereafter be expressed. These confections following are also very commodious: viz. De Cumino, Diatrion pipereon, Diagalanga, Dianisum, Diacalamintha, Diapliris, Aromaticum rosatum, and after them a good draught of Wine. If you desire to make a powder, then prepare this following: Take Ginger halfe an ounce, Annis one quarter of an ounce, prepared Coriander one ounce and a halfe, Mace, Galingale, Cucubes, and Nutmegs, of each one dragme. This being beaten all small, then put as much Sugar vnto it as you please. This powder consumeth all wind, and hindreth also the genera∣tion of other. You haue also herebefore certaine grosse powders for the stomacke, which be also very good. In like manner do Annis, Fennell seede, Caraway, and Comin, (either bare or con∣fected, and taken before meate) consume all paine in the guts. The sirupe of Wormwood expel∣leth also winds. For this are also very conuenient clisters, if they be made of such things as do cause wind to auoide, as this following: Take Mallowes, Hollihock rootes, Violet leaues, Bearefoote, and Béets, of each one handfull, Centorie, Rapontica, Calmus, white Mints, Marioram, Southern∣wood, Rue, and Hyssop, of each halfe a handfull: Séeth them all together in sufficient water, and take fifteene or sixtéene ounces thereof, hony of Roses, and oyle of Rue of each thrée ounces, Hie∣ra Picra one ounce, Benedicta laxatiua, halfe an ounce, then temper them all together. Yet this clister is to be diminished or augmented according to the abilitie of the sicke per∣son. Suppositories may also be vsed for this, which are thus to be made: Take Rue and Co∣min, or Caraway, of each one handfull, Swines bread one roote and a halfe, Boreas one dragme, clarified Hony thrée ounces, make Suppositories thereof. Another: Take Beuercod, Hony, Oxe gall, and oyle of Violets, of each a like quantitie, let them séeth somewhat thicke: after∣wards wet a suppositorie in it, bounden at a thréed, and vse it as before: it consumeth wind ex∣céedingly and purgeth very much. Potions and such like. TAke the rootes of Smallage, of Fennell, and of Parsly, of each two ounces, Raisins, the stones taken out, two ounces and a halfe, ten or twelue fat Figs, twentie or foure and twenty Iuiubes: Séeth them all together in two quarts of Water euen to the halfe, and take thereof thrée or foure ounces tempered with the foresaid confection. The common people and husbandmen do commonly vse slight things which they can best get; amongst which
may this potion following be reckoned: Take fresh Cow dung about halfe an ounce; temper it with good wine and wring it thorough a cloth, and then drinke thereof, it is much commended. Other do ascribe this to sheepes dung, also Chickwéede is commended for the same boyled in water and so drunken. Likewise also Wormwood wine, or Wormwood sodden in water: also Meade being drunken is very good for this paine; Wine measurably drunken driueth not only the wind out of the bowels, but also out of all parts of the bodie. The wines of Harts toung and Marioram gentle, are also much commended for these paines in the guts, and mo other a∣romaticall wines, as of Galingall, Nutmegs, and Cloues. Item, take Species Iustini one dragme, and drinke the same twice a wéeke with one ounce of Rosewater, it is also good against the grauell. Master Tristrams Water is also good against all paines in the guts: likewise is also commended one dragme of Beuercod drunken with one ounce of Mellicraton. In the meane time may outward things also be vsed: for this one may take the herbes, the séede, and other ingrediences whereof Clisters haue bene made, wring them out hard, stampe them and temper them with butter, with Barrowes grease and oyle of Cammomill vnto a plaister, and so lay it warme ouer the belly, it is very good. But if one will lay any thing vpon the maladie: then must the belly be warmed well before with warme cloths, for this may be made also the foresaid bags of Millet and Salt: or take vnbeaten Millet, Oates, and Fennell, or Bran, which you can get: parch them in a panne and apply it warme vpon the paine. Item: Take parched Linséede sixe ounces, parched Comin one ounce, Bran halfe a handfull; beate them all grosse and make a bag thereof, then let it séeth in water or wine a good space, after∣wards wring it out and lay it very warme vpon it. Item: take the oyle of Scorpions, oyle of bitter Almonds, and Turpentine, of each sixe ounces; let them melt all by the fire, afterwards temper halfe a dragme of Saffron amongst it. Lastly, dippe shéeps wooll in it, and lay it warme vpon the griefe: or take Pellitorie, and powned Linseede, of each one handfull, powre two oun∣ces of the oyle of Scorpions vnto it, and let them be made hote together; afterwards put a lit∣tle Saffron vnto it, and vse it as before. Warme bread laid vpon the belly or the stomack asswa∣geth the paine, and is good against the suffocation of the mother or wombe. Another: Take Hony, Butter, Salt and Vineger, of each a like quantitie, let them séeth all together a good while vntill it begin to be somewhat tough, then spread it on a cloth, and bind it warme vpon the belly. Item, take wild Thyme, Marioram, Caraway leaues, Cammomill, Wormewood and Sage, which you will, cut it small, and put it into a bag, then make it moist with wine or water, and let it warme in a pan and vse it as before. Or Cow dung and Butter, of each a like much; temper amongst it halfe so much beaten Comin. Wolfs dung is also very good for this vse, a plaister being made of it. For this is also good the plaister of Bayberries, which is descri∣bed in the eleuenth Chapter and the 5. §. Item, another salue also which is described in the third Part, in the tenth Chapter and the 5. §. Take Comin, Caraway, &c. Or prepare this following: Take Goose grease, and oyle of Scorpions, of each thrée ounces, Saffron one scruple, Waxe as much as suffiseth. These oyles following are also to be vsed for this disease, viz. oyle of Lillies, of Cammomil, of Rue, of Dill, of bitter Almonds, of Spike, of Bayberries, and Elecampane rootes, of Peni∣royall, and such like oyles which be warme of nature, and chiefly if Ameos and Masticke be boyled in them. The bathing and fomenting is also very profitable for this sicknesse, which may be made as hereafter followeth; and may be prepared according as the cause requireth. The bathes of swéete waters are very good to asswage the paine, and they be especially commended after the cholick, and after purging, and that fasting. After bathing is some Troacle or Mithridate to be vsed and taken, and to sweate after it. For this be also good Sulphurie bathes which be warme by nature. Now will we declare all the foresaid things that expell wind and consume it, and especially those which may be vsed for Bathes and Fomentations, viz. Rue, Dill, Rosemarie, Fennell, Chamedryos, and field Cypers. Amongst the seedes, Annis, Fennell, Comin, Caraway, séedes of Rue, Ameos, and Dil séed. Note ye that the patient must sit no déeper than to the breast in this bath: and also may not
tarrie long therein, that he fall into no swound: Otherwise the bath is very profitable, for it openeth the pores, and doth consume the wind whereby the paine is delayed. You may wet a Sponge in his bath, and lay the same oftentimes warme vpon the belly. Likewise you may also fill a bladder and hold it warme vpon the belly. If you haue not this decocted water, then fill a bladder halfe full with Linseede oyle, and make it warme in hote water, and so lay it vpon the belly. Another Bath. AFter that the bodie is well purged, he may sit in a Tub with warme Sallad oyle, and when the paine is asswaged, then to go out of it againe. But if the oyle cannot be had nor be gotten, then vse this ensuing: Take Pellitorie, Violet leaues, Rue, Cammomill, Linséede, Fenegréeke, Hollihockes, and the sprigs of Colewoorts, of each thrée handfuls; seeth them all together in water for a bath. Of this may you also make a Lotion for the féete, be it cooling or warming according as the case requireth. For a Fume: Take Frankinsence, Masticke, Lignum Aloes, and Sandaraca, of each a like quantitie, cast it vpon hote coles, and receiue the fume vpon the belly or where the paine is, for it doth draw much wind vnto it. The place also is first to be rubbed so long vntill it be thorow red, and afterwards well annointed with any of the foresaid oyles. The wind may also be consumed through good gouernment, (if the same be put in practise) through exercise and sobrietie: for that where there is not much moisture receiued into the bo∣die, there cannot ingender much wind. And when such a patient hath recouered his health, then must he beware of gréene herbes, milke, and all other things which be windie. He must also addict himselfe to drinke hony water with spices, or prepare this Meade ensuing. Take two ounces of clarified honie, thrée pints of water, séeth and skum it well. When it is cleansed, then are you to hang therein half an ounce of grosse beaten Pepper, and afterwards let them seeth againe vntill there remaine about one quart of moisture. When it is then cold, take out the Pepper being well wrung out. For this serueth also burnt Wine, or Aqua vita, yet there is nothing better than good old Wine moderatly drunken. He is to be restrained from all watred wine, because it ingendreth winds. He must likewise beware of all cold drinkes, viz. the water of all herbes, fruite, fish, milke, and such like. For all manner of paine in the belly. §. 8. ALbeit that herebefore there be many things discouered for to asswage the paine of the belly, notwithstanding we must here set downe somewhat of the Nar∣cotica, which be things that take away or do numbe the senses, for which we aduise in the vse of them to begin alway with the least, and so to come to the greatest, so that nature be not violated. Therefore where great paine is, you must apply parched Millet, Panick and salt. Item, take Cammomill, Melilot, Rue, Marioram, Penniroyall, Rosemarie, Comin, Annis, Fennell and Dill séed beaten grosse which one will, and as much as one will: let them séeth in wine, and whilest it is warme wet a sponge in it, and lay it vpon the place of the paine. Make bags of the foresaid séeds and herbs, and sprinkle wine vpon a hote stone, and warme them thereon. Or séeth it in wine, and then lay them vpon the belly as all other. Afterwards annoint the place with warme oyle, viz. oyle of Cammomill and of Costus, but if the paine be intollerable great in the vppermost guts, that one feareth to fall thereby in a swound, one must (through extreame néede) put things in pra∣ctise which do numbe the senses: for which the Confection Philonium is to be vsed and chiefly with the purging Confection Diaphoenicon, but this must be done with the counsell of a learned Phisition, as we haue oftentimes alreadie admonished, yet shall suffise halfe a dragme tempe∣red with halfe an ounce of the Conserue of Roses. Others in steade of Philonium, vse the pils of Cynoglossa, for that they be safer; also the Triphera Sarasenica. And albeit that through all these former reasons it may be sufficiently vnderstood, how that he is to be kept with meate and drinke, neuerthelesse we will briefly rehearse it once againe for methode sake.
This patient is oftentimes and very long to be rubbed with warme clothes. He is also to inure him alwaies before meales to walke easily. He is also to be restrained from all Fruite, Pease, Beanes, and Must, and all that procreateth winds. He shall also eate all light meates, and dresse his meate with Dill séede, Comin and Annis: Partriches and all other field Fowles are very good for him. The iuice of old Cockes boyled with the foresaid seedes, is here much commended. For this sicknes is also much aduised to eate Hedghogs flesh rosted, which causeth all pains of the intrailes to cease. His bread must be a litle more salted and raised: then commonly good old cleare and white Wine, if there be no Ague with it, is to be his drinke. Of the paine of the bowels through any impostume and other affections of the guts. §. 9. WE haue numbred this herebefore in the 4. §. for the fourth cause of the paine in the bowels. But in case this paine in the bowels be caused through any impo∣stume and vlcer of the Lyuer, of the Spleene, Kidneys, or any other parts, then is the same to be knowne by the place where those parts do dye: Like by each of these is sufficiently declared what is to be done for it. But if the bowels be hurt without any impostume, and that the same may be felt with the finger or any other instrument, then may you find all that described in the tenth Chapter and 3. §. But if in the paine of the belly through heate there appeare any impostume in the one side, then must a veine be opened on the other side: for the same must not be foreslowed, for that it is much need∣full. First, he must before other things haue a veine opened within the third or fourth day in the contrarie side of the paine, and afterwards on the other side where the paine is felt. This being now done, then take two parts of water, and one part of vineger, and make a sponge wet therein, and so apply it to the paine. When the sponge beginneth to be warme, then wet it a∣gaine, and reiterate this oftentimes. Moreouer, the patient is oftentimes to be purged with Manna, Cassie, and sowre Dates, and let him be ordered like as one is to be ordered who hath an Ague. He must also beware of Vineger, sowre Pomegranates, and also of all soure things which may hurt the bowels. Boy∣led Barly, and oaten paps, Mallowes, Burrage, and Orage decocted in Henbroth, or eaten alone be very meete for him: and if the Ague be not great, then are they to be drest with butter or with oyle. He must also kéepe a good diet, and must vse much oyle of Sesamum in his meates. His drinke must be barly water decocted with Licorice, and all his whole gouernment cooling and moistening, as followeth hereafter. Take Mallowes with the rootes, Hollihocke rootes, Bearefoote, and Violet leaues, of each one handfull, Burrage flowers, and flowers of Buglos, of each halfe an ounce, foure or fiue Prunes; séeth them all together in a pot of water euen to the halfe, and then take of this decoction twelue or sixtéen ounces, and temper with it two oun∣ces of Cassie, oyle of Violets thrée ounces, of Hony one ounce then make a Clister of it. This is also especially commended being made with Gotes milke, Cassie, and oyle of Almonds. When as then the impostume is broken vp, then are you to vse for to cleanse it, Clisters, Barly water and Hony, and afterwards consolidating medicins. But if so be that one perceiue any parings of the bowels in the stooles, and that with great paine, then are these following to be vsed. Take somewhat lesse then a pound of stéeled water, and séeth therin broad and picked Plan∣taine and Roses, of each one M. euen to the halfe. Take twelue or sixtéene ounces thereof, and melt therein one ounce of Deere suet, thrée yolkes of Egs well beaten, oyle of Roses two oun∣ces, Thomas Sugar one ounce, and temper them all together. Another: Take broad Plantaine, wild Tansie, and Comfrey, of each one handfull, Pome∣granat pils one ounce; seeth them all together in a pot of steeled water euen to the halfe: then melt in this decoction two ounces of Deere suet, Trociscos de Carabe, De Terra sigillata, of each one quarter of an ounce, then make a Clister of it. For plaisters, take the sodden hearbes and the other things of the former Clisters, powne them to grout, and temper therewith halfe an ounce of powned red Saunders, Barly meale two ounces, and oyle of Violets as much as doth suffise for a plaister, and then lay it warme o∣uer it, it doth abate the paine very much.
Another: Take Mallowes, and Hollihocke rootes with the herbes of Nightshade, Violets, Cammomill, and Melilot, of each halfe an ounce: beate them all together, and temper there∣with oyle of Violets, of water Lillies, and Ducks grease, of each thrée dragmes, Linseed meale one ounce, and then make a plaister of it. If need require to purge more, then may the same be done with the conserue of Prunes. But if so be this paine of the bowels be with a cold tumor, then must stronger Clisters be vsed, as there be sundrie set foorth in the 6. §. against the paine of the bowels through Phlegma. But first are the oyle of Cammomill with Vineger, and the oyle of Roses (that it may pierce and strengthen the bowels) for to be vsed: after the Clisters expressed before in the fift §. may this plaister following for mollification be vsed for to ripen and asswage the paine: Take Linseede meale, Fenegréeke meale, Wheaten meale, and Barly meale of each two ounces, sixe yolkes of Egs, oile of Cammomill, and good wine as much as is néedfull for to make a plai∣ster, this must be laid warme vpon it. Another: Take eightéene or twenty Figs, séeth them well in water, crums of white bread two ounces, White meale one ounce and a halfe, vnsalted Barrowes grease, and oile of Cam∣momil as much as is néedful for to make a plaister: let them all séeth a litle together, and then lay them warme vpon it: you may also put warme vnto it one ounce of beaten Cammomill. It happeneth also sometimes, that in these impostumes the vrine is retained backe, because that the conduits are stopt through the tumor; therfore if that befall the Saphea must be opened, and the kidneys and the priuities annoynted with the oyle of Cammomill, and oile of Violets, and also are Clisters and Plaisters to be vsed, like as shall hereafter be further spoken of in the prouocation of vrine. Of the paine in the bowels through heate and Cholera. §. 10. THis is the last cause whereby (as is discoursed before in the fourth §.) the paine of the guts may be ingendred; and when it commeth with heate and an ague, it is not then so hurtfull or lingring as that which procéedeth of Phlegma. For this must the patient first of all be purged with sirupes and such like things as do coole, and further be kept with necessarie meate and drinke. He is lastly to vse clisters in this manner following: first of all he is to take certaine daies to∣gether preparatiue sirupes, as both the sirups of Vineger, Oxysacchara sirupe of Violets, of Ro∣ses, of Endiue, and of water Lillies, with some decoction wherein the same herbes haue bene decocted, wherof diuers be described in the thrd Part. For purging. TAke fresh Cassie one ounce or one ounce and a halfe, the iuice of Endiue well clarified and skummed thrée or foure ounces: then make a potion of it, and giue it him warme, or in stead of the iuice (if one cannot get the same) then take Endiue water. Another: Take eightéene or twenty Prunes, and fiue or sixe fat Figs; seeth them all toge∣ther in sufficient water, and take of this decoction thrée or foure ounces, temper Cassie therein, and oyle of swéet Almonds fiue or sixe ounces tempered with Sugar, and the same drunken at once loose the bodie very gently, and is also most sure that one may giue to the children newly borne: Likewise Manna decocted with sowre Dates, Prunes, and with Sugar, is also very re∣quisite to loose and coole. Concerning the meates he must be restrained like as in other hote sicknesses, and must chief∣ly eschew alwaies meates which make wind. But oyle of Almonds vsed in his meate, be very meete for him. All his Clisters must be made soluble and cooling, like as be these following: Take péeled Barly, Mallowes, Hollihock roots, and Violets, of each one handfull, Prunes, Sebestes, of each eight or ten, the séedes of Melons, of Purslaine, of Gourds, of each one ounce, Branne halfe a handfull; Séeth them all together, and take of this decoction and put vnto it oile of Roses, and of Violets of each one ounce and a halfe, Cassie for the clister one ounce, Electuarium de Succoro∣sarum
fiue dragmes: then make a Clister of it, like as hath bene sufficiently shewed. But here is to be noted, that if any parings auoid with the guts, then must oyle of Roses be most of al vsed; yet oyle of Violets doth asswage the paine of the guts if the same come through any sharpnesse or any heate. Or take Mallowes, Hollihocks, Bearefoote, Violet herbes, and Béetes, of each one hand∣full, Barly and Branne of each halfe a handfull: let them seeth all together, and then take of this decoction twelue or sixtéene ounces, and temper Cassie in it one ounce, Hiera Picra three quarters of an ounce, Benedicta Laxatiua three dragmes, oile of Violets thrée ounces, Salt one dragme or twaine, minister it as is accustomed. This ensuing is also speciall good if any bodie haue bene bounden certaine dayes together: Take twelue or sixtéene ounces of Cow milke, temper one ounce of Cassie amongst it, and mi∣nister it warme. There may also a cooling plaister be laid vpon the belly, whereof there be diuers discouered against the heate of the stomacke and the Lyuer: yet must alwaies some Cammomill, Worm∣wood, and such like be tempered amongst it. For a cooling you may also take preserued Ribes, or any such like, as in the eleuenth Chapter §. 6. is shewed. Of the paine of the belly mixt with grauell. §. 11. FOr this disease is much aduised, to take thrée dayes one after another, a good draught of the water of Elderne flowers, which helpeth maruellous well. Item, take the iuice of Pelli∣torie eight ounces, oile of Rue two ounces: séeth the dung of a Dog in it, which hath ea∣ten nothing but bones: straine it thorough, and vse it for a Clister. It is also much aduised for to take for purgation halfe an ounce of Diaphoenicon, and Sebestes one dragme and a halfe, Phi∣lonium Romanum one scruple, Species Iustini halfe a scruple: temper them all together, and drinke it, and then a little fat broth after it. But how easily an error is committed in distinguishing the paine of the guts, from the paine of the raines, and the paine of the grauell, it shal hereafter be declared, where we shall speake of the grauell. Of the paine in the bellies of young children. §. 12. WE haue here briefly shewed of the oyle of swéet Almonds which is to be tempered with Sugar, and may be giuen boldly to new borne children for the paine of the belly: This is alwaies found to be good. The water of Larks spurres is also good for the same, as well in old folkes as in young children. For a small Clister, take Mallowes, Holli∣hocke rootes, and Pyrola, of each halfe a handfull, Melilot and Rosemary, of each halfe so much: séeth them in a pint of water, and then take of this decoction litle or much, according to the bignes of the child, Hony of Roses halfe an ounce, oyle of Cammomill two ounces, Salt halfe a dragme: temper them all together. Item, take vnto small children alwayes a spoonefull of the water of black Cherries in their pap, for it asswageth the paine. Oyle of Nutmegs annoyn∣ted about the Nauell, and a warme cloth laid vpon it: and in like manner the oyle of Scorpi∣ons is also very commodious for this infirmitie. Also Chickweede fried in oyle, and applyed warm on the belly. Also take Mints, & Mallowes fried in fresh Butter, or Cammomill and Wormewood, of each a like much: cut them all together méetly small, and put them in a little bag: then make it meetly warme in hote wine, wring it well out, and so lay it ouer the childs belly. Item, cut an Onion very small, frie it in oyle, and bind the same vpon the Nauel of yong children and old folkes. Albeit, that it be not now our intent to write much of Chirurgerie, yet neuerthelesse, we can not let this escape: viz. if any be wounded in the belly that his bowels issue foorth, and then happen to swell that they cannot be put backe into the body, then warme them with warme milke or wine. After that may the Chirurgion well know what he hath to do.
Of the Wormes in the belly. §. 13. FIrst of all, there is not any thing more certaine, than that in mans bodie, like as in stinking kennels, in chéese, and in stinking flesh, worms do grow, and that out of a putrified matter: But in man do they chiefly procéed through vn∣accustomed meates that cannot be digested: also of surfetting and ouerchar∣ging of the stomacke. Item through bathing, and vse of venery with a full sto∣macke, through eating of fresh Beanes, of salt fish that is without scales, through Swines flesh, and such like things moe. Also these wormes do grow by eating much fruite. Therefore haue children most annoy thereby about haruest. These wormes do ingender sometimes in the stomacke, and otherwhiles in the bowels; and some suppose that they onely grow in the blind gut; but they which haue somewhat more carefully beheld them, do write yt the long Wormes do ingender in the vppermost bowels, and the small, like vnto chéese Magots onely in the arsegut, and in the middlemost guttes should round wormes ingender called Ascarides. Some do take it otherwise. In fine, we will let them dispute thereof; for they do accord herein, that there be three sorts of wormes which may grow in mans body, like as is shewed before. And to the end that somewhat be discoursed of these kinds of wormes; The long ones be knowne to be in yong children through their gnawing in the bowels, through a small, dry, and troublesome Cough: Moreouer, they do awake suddenly out of their sléepe sometimes with an outcry; afterwards they do quickly hold their peace, and haue an vnequall pulse. Also they haue vncertaine Agues, with coldnesse of the outward members, which accidents do happen vnto them without any cause thrée or foure times a day. Such children haue an vnnaturall desire of meate, they let out their toung, gnash with their téeth, sweate about the eyes: they be gladly quiet: they be also very quickly angrie, and snappish or testie on them that do awake them, and as now they be ruddie, and immediatly bleake againe: they talke in their sléepe, be frighted in their dreames, and do lye very vnquiet. When they awake, they do then rub their nose, the eyes sinke into their heads, they will be very hard fauoured in their face, they féele great paine in the belly, they haue much fome and spittle, their mouths will be drie, yet more by day then by night, and their breath stinketh much. In like maner it happeneth very well, that they auoide the wormes at the nose, at the mouth and through stooles: but amongst people in yeares there be besides these signes such an extreme paine of the belly also, that they cast their hands and féete from them like as it were a collicke. And as they come into their stomacke, then do they get a great wambling and loathing of all meates. And when one forceth himselfe to eate, yet can he not swallow the meate, but must cast vp againe presently the meate which he hath taken: their ordure is very stinking, their belly swelleth on high, like as if it were full of wind. These be now the signes of the long wormes, which signes though they be not alwayes ap∣parant, yet neuerthelesse this disease may be knowne by some of these. The broad wormes be as well in them that haue no Ague, as in them which be troubled with lingring Agues: they do also bring some of the foresaid signes with them, and especially these will be knowne as well through the great gnawing in the stomacke, as through the vn∣measurable desire of meate. And although they haue eaten inough, and do not by and by eate againe, yet then do they séele that gnawing and biting againe as before. They will be also very leane, and dry of bodie. But this is the very surest signe, that the patient doth auoid through the stoole small things, like to the kernels of Gourds. It is also found, that some not estéeming this gnawing of the wormes, and taking no aduice for it, that the guts be bitten asunder, and that the wormes are got into the hollownesse of the belly, whereof doth follow afterwards a great calamitie, as madnesse, the falling sicknes, dogs hunger, swouning, paine of the belly, ob∣struction or binding of the body, and lastly, a painefull and bitter death. Therefore is this dis∣ease not to be accompted small, but rather men are betimes to vse all requisite remedies for it. But if the worms be not in the bowels, but in the stomack, and in the mouth of the stomack, then be they commonly vomited vp, & they that be in the bowels are rid and dispatcht through the stoole.
Of the third kinde of wormes which kéepe themselues in the Arsegut, shall immediately hereafter be discoursed. I haue therefore the longer discoursed of this, for that it is a common disease amongst children and common families, whereby common housholders might know their right difference, afterwards we will write of the remedies seruing for these common sorts of wormes: but aboue all, there be prescribed by the learned certaine common rules of them. The first is, that the lower the wormes be in the bowels (whether they be there growen or descended out of the stomack thither) so much the bitterer and stronger must the medicine be which is giuen from aboue, because that she may not lose her vertue through so long a passage. Secondly, the wormes Ascarides are not so easily killed through Phisick, as other wormes, therefore must stronger remedies be vsed for them. Thirdly, to preserue himselfe frō wormes, he is to beware of all such meates as do increase Phlegma, and to purge out the same in aged folks, like as we shall speake more at large thereof. Fourthly, the first intention of the Phisiti∣ans is to kill the wormes, afterwards to expell them, least that through their stench they do infect the hart, the stomack, and the whole bodie. Fiftly, as soone as one perceiueth the wormes, then must he indeuor to expell them, and so to frée himselfe from great distresse. Sixtly, all reme∣dies which be hote in the third degrée, are very fit for this purpose if there be not a strong Ague or impostume with it. Seuenthly, if one will expell the wormes through any meate or drinke, then is the same to be done with an emptie stomack, and fasting. Eightly, the wormes are most fittest to be killed through hote and very bitter things, as (to the contrary) through sweete and fat things they are fed and sustained. Ninthly, all they that haue the wormes, may be fed two dayes with sweete and fat things; but the third day when they be hungrie and emptie, are bit∣ter things to be giuen. Tenthly, if one take any thing to kill the wormes, then must the belly and the stomack be annoynted or plaistred on the out side with astringent and bitter things. Eleuenthly, if so be that the wormes be in the vppermost guts, or in the stomack, then will they be more easily killed and expelled through that which is taken at the mouth. But if they be in the nethermost guts, then are they killed with Clisters & Suppositories. But if in the middle∣most guts, are to be vsed both these remedies. The order how a man may preserue himselfe from wormes. ALl those that are to be preserued from wormes are of thrée sorts, as children which do yet suck, children of the age of fouretéene yéeres. Now for to free the sucking children, the Nurse must eate all light meates, and refraine from all Fruit, Fish, and Milke, but especially from ouercharging her selfe with any kinde of meates. The children which do not suck must be kept after the same manner, and be restrained from all that is slimy, and also be∣ware of Fruit, and especially of those which be not ripe, and those that be wormeaten, for they also ingender wormes in the belly. The youths and people in yéeres are to be kept likewise as we haue said. Also twice or thrice a yéere phlegme ought to be prepared in them, with Oxymel of Squils, or Compositum, or with the sirupe of Calamintha, and such like. Afterwards they are to take Hiera Picra, with the decoction of Polipodie rootes, Mirabolani, Chebuli, of a little Colo∣mint, for to purge. They are also to vse rather rosted meate then sodden. They must eschue all grosse and fat meates, for thereby do the wormes grow especially. Also he must eate euery day a little Mustard séed. But if so be that the wormes be present, then must one looke to kill and expell them by all meanes, for which purpose these hote things following be fit, viz. Wormewood, Bay leaues, Peach kernels, Rue, white Mints, bitter Costus, Centorie, Horehound, Lupins, Annis, Smal∣lage séed, parched Nardus seed, Mints, Elecampane rootes, dry Bayberies, Southernwood, Comin, Cresses séed, Caruway, bitter Almonds, Diptamus, Penniroyall, Gals of old beasts, and chiefely Oxe gals, or Wolfs gals, the common Wormeséed, Cinnamome, Gentian, the rootes of the femall Fearne, and Agrimonis: of all which foresayd things, one dragme, or a dragme and a halfe is to be taken in winter time with wine, and in Sommer with some cooling waters, and that chiefly with Purslaine and Endiue water. These things following do not only kill the wormes, but also expell them forcibly, to wit, Aloe, rootes of blew Floure de luce, the iuice of wilde Cucumbers, Agaricus, Coloquint, wilde Saffron, the fresh iuice of Elecampane rootes, Turbith, and Rabarbarum. One may vse some
of these foresaid things, if there be no Ague with it. Cold simples which doe kill the wormes are these: viz. prepared Coriander, Butchers Broome seede, Hypocistis, sealed earth, Purslaine séed, seeds of Endiue and of Lettice, the iuice of Plantaine, rinds of Pomegranats, sowre Pomegranats, Oranges and their séed, Citron séed, burnt Harts horne, Asses milke, all that is sowre, bread infused in vineger, Broome séeds, Cole∣woort séed, dry Plantaine, séeds of Orage, and vnripe Sallad oyle, a good deale of it taken at once. You may boldly take these things, where as heate and the Ague is. And further to speake of the compounded things, we will first of all take the things in hand which may be vsed inwardly and in heate. Take the sirupe of vineger one ounce and a halfe, temper it with Endiue water and Purslaine water, and drinke this certaine dayes together alwayes fasting. Item, take the seeds of Butchers Broome, sealed earth, Hypocistis, the iuice of Sloes, of each one quarter of an ounce: boyle them all together in sufficient water euen to the halfe, and drinke thereof certaine daies together thrée or foure ounces at once. Or take Grasse-rootes, and Butchers Broome séed, of each one ounce; séeth them all together in a pot of water euen to the halfe, and drinke thereof as before. Another. Take eightéene or twentie Sebestes, Purslaine séed one dragme, Grasse rootes, and Millet, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar foure ounces, Veriuice, and the iuice of Pomegranates, of each two spoonfuls; let them seeth together, and skumme them well. But if you haue not this iuice, then take in steed thereof go Vineger. Item, take prepared Coriander, and the séed of Smallage, of each one dragme an a halfe, calcined bones of a Stags hart thrée quarters of an ounce, red Corall one dragme, Cin∣namome halfe a dragme, Calmus halfe a scruple, prepared Perles halfe a dragme, Diptamus, Ammoniacum, filed Iuorie, and burnt Silke, of each two graines, eight or ten Bayberies, Sugar thrée quarters of an ounce: make a fine pouder of it, and giue one drag. of it more or lesse. Burnt Harts horne alone two or thrée dragmes giuen with Meade, doth maruellously kill the wormes. Or take burnt Harts horne one dragme, Pyonie séed, Smallage séeds, Corian∣der, Cole woorts seed, Nardus séed, séeds of Plantaine and of Endiue, of each halfe a dragme, Diptamus one scruple, red Saunders, Corall, and Pearle, of each sixe graines, Sugar as much as all the rest; make a subtile pouder of it. Another: Take filed Iuorie which is a little parched one quarter of an ounce, prepared Co∣riander one dragme and a halfe, Diptamus one dragme and halfe a scruple, Sealed earth one dragme, temper them al togither. Item: Take Rubarbe, Basill séed, Plantaine séed, Pomegra∣nate pecles, Caruway, Butchers broome seeds, Carduus Benedictus séed, filed Harts horne, & filed Iuorie, of each halfe an ounce, rindes of Mulberrie rootes, Colewoort séed, Citron seed, and rindes of Willow trees, of each three dragmes, Purslaine seed, and Diptamus, of each two scruples, red Corall and Pearles, of each one scruple: make a pouder thereof, and then giue one dragme or twaine of it, viz. in winter (when there is no ague) with wine; but in sommer, and when there is an ague with Oxycrato. Item: Take burnt Harts horne one dragme, prepared Coriander, and Aloe, of each halfe a scruple; beate them all togither, and giue it him with the si∣rupe of Vineger, or grasse water. In like manner is also especiall good for this the leaues of Smallage one dragme: or take the seeds of Purslaine one dragme, Muscus fower scruples, red Corall, and prepared Coriander, of each one scruple, Orage seeds one dragme, make a pou∣der of all these, and giue thereof with strong wine, or with water wherein grasse rootes and A∣grimonie haue beene decocted, each time fower graines. Another: Take Orage seeds one dragme, Wormeseed (which is Semen) one dragme and a halfe, Grasse rootes, flowers of Hyssop, Southernwood, of each halfe a dragme, Licorice fower scruples, Cinnamome, and Di seed, of each halfe a scruple: stamp each a part, and afterwards mixe them togither, and at the last put halfe a scruple of Muscus vnto it: then giue thereof from three or sixe graines vnto halfe a scruple with warme grasse water. Item: Take the seeds of Orage, of Purslaine, wilde Thyme, and Marierom, of each halfe a dragme, Wormeseed three dragmes, Licorice, and Lupines, of each one scruple, Muscus halfe a dragme, Ambra halfe a dragme: mixe them all togither and giue one dragme and somewhat more at one time with Grasse water. Another: Take the seeds of Plantaine, and Wormeseed, of each one dragme or somewhat lesse; according to the age, and giue thereof as before. Item: Take Plantaine séed, calcined Harts horne, and Wormeseed, of each a like quantitie, vse it as the other. Or if you will make a confection, then take burnt Harts horne one dragme, prepared
Coriander, Pyonie séed, the séed of Smallage, Nardus séed, the séeds of Plantaine, and of En∣diue, of each halfe a dragme, Diptamus halfe a scruple, red Corall, Sanders, and Pearles, of each fiue graines, Sugar one ounce and a halfe: then make Tabulats thereof with Grasse water. Then take about one quarter of an ounce at once. You haue before in the second part the third Chapter, and seauen §. of the hardning of the breast, and in the third part the second Chapter, and eleuenth §. a preparation of earth woormes into pouder against the yellow Iaundise, whereof may a drinke or confection be made. But if the guts be distended and the heate not ouer great, then lay this plaister following vpon the belly: Take Linséed meale, and Beane meale, of each one ounce and a halfe, Woormewood one handfull, Aloe thrée quarters of an ounce, and make a plaister of it with Meade, or with the oile of Wormewood. But if there be a small ague with the wormes, then may be giuen to people in yéeres (each according to his age) Treacle or Mithridate; for both of them do kill the wormes and expell them. Item: Take the séeds of Sophia one dragme, calcined Harts horne, and Pomegranate péeles, of each halfe a dragme, Diptamus, Cloues, Rubarbe, of each one dragm, Wormeseed halfe a dragme, Saffron fiftéene graines, Sugar nine ounces: Séeth them all togither in Worme∣wood water, or in Grasse water, and then make Tabulats thereof: or take Wormeséed one quarter of an ounce, Knotgrasse, and white Diptamus, of each two scruples, burnt Harts horne, Peach leaues, of each one scruple, Rubarb one drag. make them all togither into a subtile pou∣der, and giue thereof one dragme or twaine at once. But if you will haue a confection, then take thereto thrée ounces of Sugar decocted in water of Knotgrasse, and giue thereof from halfe an ounce vnto a whole, according to the age of the patient. Item, other moe which be Laxatiue: Take parched Rubarbe, and Wormeseed, of each one dragme, prepared Pearles one dragme and a halfe, burnt Harts horne one dragme, Sugar sixe ounces; make a Confection of it as be∣fore. Or take Wormséed halfe a dragme, Comin one scruple, Cinnamome two scruples, burnt Harts horne halfe a dragme, Turbith one quarter of an ounce, Sugar one ounce and a quar∣ter: make loosings thereof, and giue about one quarter of an ounce of it. Item, take Cinna∣mome, burnt Harts horne, Centorie, and Gentian, of each one dragme, Rubarbe one scruple, Sugar sixe ounces decocted with grasse water: make also loosings thereof. They be very good, and they be altogither easie. The séeds of Rue should also be very good for the Wormes: like as also is the vineger of Rue, and the common good vineger. Take in like maner the flowers of Feuerfew as much as you can gripe betweene two fingers, and vse it fasting. This hereafter ensuing may be vsed for children of three yeres of age: Take white Diptamus, Wormeséed, Carlina, and Rubarbe, of each a like quantity; poune them to powder, and giue each time one dragme thereof more or lesse with wine, according to the importance of the cause: whereupon you are to vse for children the salue of Orenges, which shall be described hereafter, and after that, this potion ensuing: Take Rubarbe two scruples, Carlini one scruple pouned small with Wormewood water. In like sort also be very meete these pils following: Take Gentian, Mirrhe, Diptamus, Worme∣wood, Mints, and filed Harts horne, of each one dragme, Turbith halfe a dragme, Agaricus one quarter of an ounce, Sal gemmae one dragme, Ginger and Cinnamome, of each two scruples, Aloe as much as the rest: then make pils of it with the iuice of Wormewood, and vse often∣times of it about one dragme at once. This composition following is most highly commended of the auncient Phisitions: Take Gentia, Centorie, and Agaricus, of each one dragme, Cloues, Nardus seed, the roots of Costus, Annis, and water of Scordium, of each fower scruples, burnt Harts horne, Roses, Sorrell seed, and prepared Perles, of each halfe a dragme: poune each alone, afterwards temper them togi∣ther, and sprinckle them with the iuice of Limons, with sharp Vineger, and Rose water, of each a like quantity, and let it drie againe; do so fiue or sixe times: At the last temper with it halfe a dragme of Saffron, one graine of Muske, and make thereof small loosings with the sirupe of Citronis. One may take thereof from halfe a dragme to a whole, whether it be made in pow∣der or pils. Conserue of Gilloflowers, and of Peach flowers, be also much commended for this purpose. There may be also many things dronken; as the iuice of Radish, and giue of it to a strong
person one quarter of an ounce: it is a very strong and a right medicine for a Plowman. This also is very like the same; poune Garlicke, and wring out the iuice, and drinke it as before. Item, take the herbe Basill, séeth it in Vineger and drinke of it, the wormes will run quicke out of your bodie. Another: take Rye, boyle it, and drinke sometimes of the decoction, and also temper your wine with it. Or take Citron péeles one dragme, or one dragme and a half, giue it to children in Milke; it should be especiall good. Take the iuice of Elecampane rootes fowre ounces, and drinke it; it is taken to be a speciall remedy. Item, take Wormeseed one ounce, Sene leaues one quarter of an ounce: poune all togither to powder, and take one dragme of it or twaine, with wine, Béere, or Meade. Item, take Pomegranate péeles beaten or sodden in wine, and drinke of it fasting about one quarter of an ounce. One dragme of pouned Zeduary drunken once or twice a day, doth also kill the wormes through his heate. Another. Take Cammomill two handfuls, twenty or fiue and twenty Sebestes, séeth them in a pot of water vnto the halfe: then take three ounces of this decoction, and temper with it thrée ounces of Oxycraton, and drinke of it thrée or fower mornings one after an other. Clisters be also very good for this if one can get Asses milke for it. If that cannot be gotten, then is there to be taken for it a broth which is decocted with 20. or 25. Sebestes and Rye, and mixe with it Butter and Hony. Also Cow milke may be taken for it alone, tempered with Hony. For to vse outwardly, the learned haue ordained diuers remedies; as plaisters, salues, and other meanes moe, as hereafter followeth: Take Aloe, Southernwood, of each a like quantitie, temper them with Hony, or oyle of Wormewood, and annoynt therewith the belly. Item, rub Oxe gall vpon the Nauell as much as you can: if it be too thin, then temper a∣mongst it beaten Wormewood, Gentian, or any other bitter thing. Note also, because that all bitter things be enemies to yong children, that regard must be had to help them with salues, plaisters, and such like, as hereafter shall follow. For that through these meanes the wormes may be killed in yong children, because children haue tender, subtile, and thin intrailes, so that the plaisters and salues may penetrate, kill the wormes, and expell them, which also through the vineger which is mixt amongst it may be the easier effected. This salue following is very approued for it: Take Wormewood, Lupins, Siluermountaine, Comin, Nardus seed, Centorie, Doronicum, burnt Harts horne, and Mirrhe, of each halfe an ounce, Aloe one ounce and a halfe, Agaricus one drag. the iuice of Oranges two ounces, oyle of Wormewood, of bitter Almonds, and oyle of Peaches, of each one ounce, an Oxe gall: let the iuice and gall be sodden together, and afterwards mixe all the said things amongst it, and then make a salue of it with Waxe: with this salue is the belly, the stomack, and backbone to be annoynted. But if you will make a plaister of it, then will it be good for the stone of the kidneies and bladder. Or take the iuice of Mints two ounces, Centorie, Wormeséed, and Lupins, of each halfe an ounce, Gentian, Wormewood, of each one drag. Diptamus, Semen Zedoariae, of each thrée drag. Oxe gall one ounce, Aloe one drag. and a halfe, Mastick, of Spica, and of Wormewood, of each one ounce, vnripe Sallad oyle, and vineger wherein tosted bread hath bin infused and is wrung out againe, of each two ounces, the iuice of Oranges halfe an ounce, white waxe vi. ounces: séeth the iuice and the oyle vntill all the moisture be consumed: when the oyle is cold, then temper the rest being beaten small amongst it, and let it seeth a little againe vntill it be thick: lastly, put thrée graines of Muscus vnto it, and spread this salue on a round cloth and bind it on the Nauell: it killeth all kinds of Wormes, and also expelleth them. Another. Take the iuice of Fleawort, Wormeséed, Southernwood, Centorie, wines bread, Peach leaues, Lupins, Ebulus rootes, and Pomegranate pils, of each one dragme, the iuice of Garlick two ounces, the iuice of water Cresses twelue ounces: let all these seeth vnto the halfe: afterwards put as much Waxe vnto it as sufficeth for to make a salue. Item, take Centorie, Wormewood, and Lupins, of each halfe a dragme, Lignum Aloes, burnt Harts horne, and Diptamus, of each one quarter of an ounce, Aloe, as much as the rest, oyle of Wormewood foure ounces, Waxe as much as will suffice. Or take Wormewood, and Lupins, of each halfe an ounce, Cinnamome, Comin, Nardus séed, Centorie, Wormeséed, oyle of Peach kernels, and of bitter Almonds, of each foure ounces, Waxe fiue ounces, make a salue thereof: it hath béene approued oftentimes. But if so be that you will haue it stronger, then take Agaricus vnto
it one dragme, Aloe one ounce and a halfe, Mirrh one dragme and a halfe, the iuice of Oranges two ounces, Oxe gals one ounce, and vse it as the rest. Take Treacle halfe an ounce, Dipta∣mus, Gentian, and Wormeséed, of each one scruple, Aloe two scruples, Oxe gals one quarter of an ounce: temper them all together, and make with beaten Coriander a salue thereof; then spread it vpon a cloth, and lay it vpon the stomacke. Item, take Zeduary rootes, Gentian, Aloe, and Wormeséed, of each one scruple, Cloues and Mastick, of each halfe a dragme, Treacle one dragme, & one quarter of an ounce. Of the stomachicall salue which is described in the eleuenth Chapter and the 5. §. make a plaister of it, and lay it ouer the stomack; for it expelleth wormes, and doth also strengthen the stomacke. Item, take Aloe, Wormewood, oyle of Peach kernels, of bitter Almonds, of Mastick, and of Spica, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Hypocistis, sealed earth, and Lupins, of each one scruple, Aloe, Spec. Hierae Picrae, of each halfe a dragme, Nardus séed, Gallia Muscata, Southernwood, Oxe gall, Lignum Aloes, of each one scruple, burnt Harts horne one quarter of an ounce, Endiue séed one dragme, Waxe as much as sufficeth for a Salue. Another: Take oyle of Wormewood, and of Mirtles, of each halfe an ounce, beaten Aloe, prepared Coriander, sealed earth, and Nardus séed, of each fiue dragmes, the iuice of Quinces, and Oxe gals, of each halfe an ounce: séeth them with the oyle vntill all the moysture be consu∣med: afterwards temper the other ingredients amongst it. This Salue following is very good, and common at the Apothecaries: Take the oyle of Wormewood thrée dragmes, oyle of bitter Almonds one ounce, oyle of Mastick one quarter of an ounce, Mirrhe, Aloe, and white Diptamus, of each one scruple, Waxe as much as néedeth. The salue of Oranges (whereof we haue spoken before) is thus prepared: Take a sowre Orange, cut it vp at the top, and wring out the iuice; then annoynt the temples with it, the hart and the stomack: the same is especiall good for yong children. Item, take oyle of bitter Almonds, of Wormewood, Oxe gals, and white Diptamus, of each one dragme, Mithridate and the iuice of Oranges, of each one quarter of an ounce: temper them together, and annoynt the Childe therewith vpon the Hart, Stomack, and Nauell. Put also vnto it one dragme of Aloe: it is a good and safe salue, especially if there be an Ague present with it. Another: Take Southernwood one ounce, Wormewood, and the rindes of the Bay trée, of each one dragme, Sugar, Colewoort séeds, of each halfe a dragme, Bayberies one quarter of an ounce, Aloe halfe an ounce, burnt Harts horne one dragme, white Diptamus two scruples: seeth them all together in Vineger and Oyle: then strayne it thorow a cloth, and vse it as the other. Or take Linséed oyle one ounce, Rosen more or lesse according to the age: melt it at the fire, and annoynt therewith the temples of the head, the stomacke, and the belly. Some do much commend the same, although it séeme slight. Item, take Aloe halfe an ounce, white Diptamus and Saffron, of each one scruple: mingle them with a little sharpe Vineger, afterwards spread it on a leather, and binde it on the Nauell. Take fresh beaten Wormewood, wet it with Vineger, and lay it warme vpon the sto∣macke. Take the marrow of Stags bones, temper it with a little molten Waxe, and annoynt therewith the whole back bone, and then lay it beaten vpon the Nauell. The iuice of Radish spread vpon the Nauell is also good for wormes. In like manner the oyle of Wormewood rub∣bed into the Nauell (chiefely of yong children) is also good for wormes. Item, there is also often to be vsed Petrolium for the same. Héere do also follow certaine plaisters which be good: Take Wormewood two ounces, Euphorbium one dragme, burnt Harts horne, and the gall of a Hare, of each halfe an ounce, Hony as much as sufficeth for a plaister. Item, take Nardus séed two scruples, Aloe and red Corall, of each one dragme, Worme∣wood and Mastick, of each one quarter of an ounce, prepared Coriander one ounce: make powder thereof. Item, take Rye meale thrée ounces, Lupin meale fiue dragmes, Saffron one dragme, Vineger, and the iuice of Rue, of each two ounces, the iuice of Wormewood foure oun∣ces, then make a plaister thereof. Another: Take Mirrh, Gentian, Aloe, and Diptamus, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Wormewood, seeds of Purslaine, and of Orage, Lupine meale, filed Iuorie, and burnt Harts
horne, of each one dragme, Saffron one dragme, Barly meale one ounce, the iuice of Garlick foure ounces: temper them all together, and put two graines of Muscus vnto it. Item, take Mints and Wormewood, of each two ounces, Centorie, Agaricus, of each halfe an ounce, Aloe one quarter of an ounce, Rose water one ounce, Lupine meale as much as all the rest: make a plaister of it for to lay vpon the stomacke. Another: Take Lupine meale, the iuice of Wormewood, Mints, Peach leaues, and the iuice of Quinces, of each two ounces, sealed earth, prepared Coriander, Mastick, Mirtle séed, and Aloe, of each halfe an ounce, Oxe gall one ounce, and red Wine. Item, take Nardus one scruple, Aloe one dragme, prepared Coriander two scruples and a halfe, Wormewood, Ma∣sticke, of each one quarter of an ounce, red Corrall one dragme: make a powder thereof, and temper it with the iuice of Wormewood, and with Vineger: wet a cloth in it, and lay it vpon the belly. Another: Take the water of Mints and of Hyssope, of each sixe ounces, the water of Grasse twelue ounces, Malmsey eight ounces, Gentian, Mirrhe, & Saffron, of each one drag. Lignum Aloes, Wormeséed, of each three quarters of an ounce, Muscus fiue graines, Vineger fiue spoone∣fuls: vse this, as is aforesaid. If it be so that the patient be very weake, then may this following be vsed: Take Sorrell water, and the water of Buglosse, and of Grasse, of each thrée ounces, Spec. Cordialium tempera∣tarum one dragme, water of Wormewood and of Hyssope, of each two ounces, the water of Broome floures three ounces, Gentian, and Diptamus, of each halfe a dragme, Saffron halfe a scruple, mingle them together. One may also vse these bags following: Take Mints, Penni∣royall, Wormewood, white Mints, Southernwood, Roses, and Plantaine, of each halfe a handfull: beate them all grosse; afterwards put them into a little bag, and weare it on the stomacke. The patient may also smell oftentimes to black Nardus séed, and likewise to tosted bread which hath béene steeped in Vineger. Of the wormes Ascarides which do keepe in the Arsegut. §. 14. MOreouer, we will héere for a conclusion of this Chapter, discourse of the small wormes Ascarides which do kéepe themselues in the Arsegut. These wormes may be perceiued by the great itch that they cause there. And for to remedie this, dip a little wooll in the oile of Abricocks, or the iuice of white water Mints. Also, you may mixe Aloe and Oxe gall amongst it, and so thrust it into the Arsegut. But first, the bodie must be purged with Rubarbe; afterwards are Suppositories to be made of fresh Porke and put vp into the Arsegut, and all the little wormes will stick fast vn∣to it. Some doe take for this poudred Porke. Also, one may annoynt the stalke of Cole∣worts with Oxe gall, and vse the same as a Suppositorie. But aboue all other things is much to be commended Quicksiluer mixed with Barrowes grease, and to dip the finger in it, and so grease or annoynt the Arsegut within with it. But for Children may Suppositories be prepa∣red with Hony, and Salt peter, putting them vp, and plucking them foorth againe imme∣diatly. Also, there may a small Clister be ministred of Milke, with Hiera Picra and Cassi, Olde folks are to haue Clisters after this manner following: Take Southernwood, and Wormewood, of each one handfull, the séeds of Cuscuta, parched Comin, and the séeds of Smallage, of each one ounce, Wormeséed one quarter of an ounce, Bran halfe a handfull, oyle of Peach kernels one ounce and a halfe, Salt one ounce, Hiera Picra fiue dragmes, the iuice of Léekes one ounce. Of this decoction take not aboue eight ounces, and make of it a Clister.
The sixteenth Chapter. Of the Kidneyes. IN the left side right vnder the Milt, in the bodie of all beasts, is the one Kidney placed, and the other in the right side a little higher, so that o∣therwhiles it doth touch a great part of the Lyuer. The Kidney which lyeth in the right side, is also in all beasts somewhat greater and fuller than that which is in the left side, and is not couered with so much fat. For because it is hoter than the left, therefore doth it consume the same fatnes, which groweth through moysture, like as it is very néedfull: for there is no part which sooner waxeth fat than the Kidneies. Both of them be made fast very strongly to the back bone. They haue sundry veines from the Lyuer whereby they draw bloud, with water, and also some part of the gall vnto them, separating the same bloud from the water, and keeping as much of the bloud as suf∣ficeth for their sustenance: collecting also the water together in their concauities (like as in a pot) which the gall dyeth yellow; and then through the Conduits Ʋreters (whereof each Kid∣ney hath one by it selfe) descendeth into the Bladder, and from thence is eiected by the yard. These Conduits or Ʋreters are whitish, hard, somewhat fleshy, and of the nature of the Blad∣der, whereby they may not suddenly be brused through the sharpnes of the vrine, or through some other occasions. The substance of the Kidneyes is of a tight well compacted flesh, fashio∣ned partly round, and not vnlike to Oxe kidneyes (the greatnes excepted.) These Kidneyes be also through many causes, and sundrie sorts of sore diseases infected, which the Grecians do call Nephrites, which is paine of the Kidneyes. But this paine of the Kidneyes doth come of many causes, as of impostumes, with heate and cold, of the grauell, and the Stone, and further of many diseases, and sharpnes of the vrine, whereof we will hereafter directly write and dis∣course. But héere, before we goe any further, we will make a generall declaration thereof. First, the learned do deuide all diseases of the Kidneyes into thrée principall sorts: to wit, if they be subiect to any bad complexion, whether they haue it of themselues, or be compounded with other diseases. Secondly, if they be not as they ought to be by nature. If they from the time of their birth be too great or too small, or fraughted and laden with grosse tough slyme, which do oppilate and stop vp the conduits that do descend into the Bladder. Thirdly, there may be also impostumes and vlcers. These thrée things may be very well compounded toge∣ther, whereby diuers diseases and paines of the Kidneyes may be caused. The causes of these foresayd diseases may be as well outward, as inward: The outward may be blowes, falles, vnaccustomed exercise, hard riding, much going a foote, great heate or cold about the Kidneyes, to drinke puddle water, to carie vnused packs, excessiue lecherie, long vse of diureticall meates and drinkes. The inward causes are a bad complexion, as if it be too hote, or too cold, too dry, or too moyst, the putrification of naturall seed or sperme, impostumes, and other paines of the Kidneyes. The signes be apparant of themselues, and to be knowne by the paine of each place, as if the same be small, meane, or great. This doth otherwhiles appeare through pissing bloud, or the water which is like bloud, euen as there were flesh washed in it. But if these diseases assaile one with heate or cold, therefore we will also (according to our custome) dis∣course a little of it, and comprehend them in two especiall points. Of the paine in the Kidneyes through cold and moysture. §. 1. THe signes of the cold diseases of the Kidneyes, are they which haue neyther heate nor thirst, nor great paine, and their water is not high coloured, but is much in quantitie, because the same could not be wasted through vnnaturall heate, which Ague, winter, and the grauell augmenteth.
For these diseases, must first a good dyet be kept. All grosse, slimy, hard meates, and all coo∣ling things are to be eschued, as Endiue, Lettice, Cicorie, Spinage, and Béetes, &c. vnlesse there be some hote things drest with them, as Parsly, Fennell, Comm, and such like. Fish that he sodden are not good for this, neither that which is drest with dough or milke. Cheese is also herein forbidden. Also cold cleere water, thicke red wine, and all fruits which make grosse bloud, as Peares, Apples, Quinces, Chestnuts, Dates, and such like. In all other things he may direct himselfe according to his old custome: but he must not swallow downe his meate gréedily nor vnchewed, that the stomack be not cloyed. Great exercise immediatly after meate is hurtfull vnto him. He is to kéepe himselfe quiet one howre and a halfe after meate at the least, without sléepe. Also all moyst and cold dwellings are to be shunned, like as néere to the earth, or such as be vnder it, or do lye néere vnto the wa∣ter. But he is to prouide himselfe of good clothes, and of a good dry chamber. He must forbeare all sorrow, vexation, anger, lying long vpon the back, riding, and such like. Concerning the remedies, héed is first to be taken whether the Kidneies be obstructed: but if so be that this be, and that the patient be yong, full of bloud, and strong, then is the Median veine to be opened on the right foote, and to let out aboue foure ounces of bloud. And after∣wards this Clister following is to be set according to his age: Take Béetes and Colewoorts, of each one handfull, boyle them as is accustomed: then take thereof about sixteene ounces, and temper in it Benedicta Laxatiua, and the confection of Bayberies, of each one quarter of an ounce, course Sugar and Cassie halfe an ounce, Salt one quarter of an ounce, oyle of Sesamum and of Lillies, of each one ounce and a halfe: temper them all together, and then minister this Clister one houre before supper. This foresaid Clister is alwayes to be vsed euery other day, according to the abilitie of the person. After letting bloud, or after the second vse of Clisters, then may this purgation following or such like be vsed: Take the confection De Psillio, and Sebeste, of each two dragmes and a halfe; temper them in thrée or foure ounces of the decoction of Parsly rootes, and fast after it at the least fiue houres. Or if you had rather haue pils, then is the patient to take the pils Foetidae one scruple, de Hiera Composita two scruples: make fiue or seuen pils thereof, and take them early in the morning. Immediatly after purging is the patient to vse this following one whole wéeke or twaine alwayes betimes in the morning. Take Syrupum Acetosum Compositum one ounce, Syrupum de Calamintha halfe an ounce, Fen∣nell, Annis, and Wormewood water, of each one ounce, afterwards drinke this warme. When these kinds of potions haue beene vsed, then is he to purge againe after this manner: Take Aloe halfe an ounce, Agaricus, Coloquinte, and Bdellium, of each one scruple, Ginger halfe a scruple, Sal Gemmae fiue graines: forme eight or nine pils of one dragme thereof, and take them betimes in the morning. Or take the confection of Bayberies one dragme, Electuarium Indum thrée dragmes and a halfe tempered with wine, and vsed as before. This confection following is also good for this: Take the séeds of Endiue, of Smallage, and of Sorrell, of each one dragme, Millet one quarter of an ounce, Cinnamome, Ginger, Cloues and Mace, of each one dragme and a halfe, Oxymel Compositum sixe ounces, hony of Roses thrée ounces, Sugar two ounces: temper them toge∣ther, and take a spoonefull euery morning before meate foure howres, and so continuing it the space of two moneths. You haue before in the twelfth Chapter and 11. §. a good iuice against the yellow Iaundies, beginning, Take Gentian, &c. which is also very good for this purpose. But if you had rather haue a confection, then take Spec. de Seminibus one dragme and a halfe, Milium Solis, Licorice, Cinnamome, Ginger, Annis, and Fennell, of each halfe a dragme, white Sugar foure ounces, being dissolued with Fennell water, make Tabulats of it: then take thereof thrée dragmes al∣wayes before meate, and that induring the space of a moneth. Sauine drieth and warmeth well; it is good for the Kidneyes, but women must not vse it much. The sirupes which be fit for this are these: to wit, Oxymel compositum, Miua cydoniorum aro∣matica, Oxymel scylliticum, compositum, & de Radicibus: all these sirupes do deopilate the obstructi∣ons of the kidneies. The plaister of Bayberries is especially commended for the cold kidneies. Item: Take Barley meale, Frankinsence, and Masticke, of each one ounce, Myrtle séed,
Roses, Cammomill, of each a like much, for to make a plaister withall, lay the same warme vp∣on the Kidneies. This plaister strengtheneth, dryeth, mollifieth, and suppleth, and doth hinder that the disease cannot corrode any further: and it is very good to incarnate or to ingender new flesh. For a salue, take oyle of Nardus one ounce and a halfe, Saffron and Pepper, of each halfe an ounce, the salue of Aragon one ounce, white Waxe thrée dragmes: melt them, and make thereof a salue. With these salues is the patient to be very well annoynted morning and eue∣ning in the warme Sunne all ouer the back bone. Another: Take oyle of Rue and of Saffron, of each two ounces, the salue of Aragon thrée ounces, temper them together, and let the backe bone be annoynted with it euery euening and morning; and fume the back with Laudanum, and then lay a warme cloth vpon it. Also to set boxing cups on the buttocks with picking is much commended for this disease, because that the veines which feede the conduits of the vrine do there end themselues in the very buttocks. And if so be then euery such patient do recouer his health through the foresaid remedies, yet is he notwithstanding to vse the foresaid salue, and two or thrée Clisters more. And if so be that the sicknes will not auoid with this, then take Spelt, Millet, of each thrée handfuls, made very warme in a bag, and lay the patient warme vpon his back thereon, vntill it begin to be cold, and then annoynt him on his Kidneies with this salue following made very warme: Take oyle of swéet Almonds, of Costus, and of Lillies, of each one ounce, oyle of Euphorbium one ounce and a halfe, Beares grease and Badgers grease, of each one ounce, Hens grease one ounce and a halfe, Sagapenum, Stechas, Costus rootes, Mirrhe and Saffron, of each one scruple, Waxe as much as is néedfull to make a plaister withall. If you occupie it, then warme as much as you meane to occupie at one time. Of the paine of the Kidneies through winde. §. 2. THis paine doth not appéere in one place only, but spreadeth it selfe abroade, and hath no signes of any impostume, neither of the stone nor ague; for the paine is more after that one hath eaten well, than before, and it is especially augmen∣ted through windie things when the meate is halfe digested. Now for to re∣medie this paine through windie things, then must he beware of all kinds of Pottage, of Pease, of Beanes, &c. Item: from all manner of fruit, from Chest∣nuts, from Rice, from Rie bread, and from Béere; for all these do ingender winde in the bodie. Against which are all things to be vsed which be light of digesture and expell winde, as Annis, Fennell, Comin, Caruway, the séeds of white Sesamum, Agnus castus, and Rue seed; likewise the confection of Diacyminum, Diacalaminthum, is very good for this. He is also to be outwardly annoynted vpon the place of the kidneies with oile of Rue, of Costus, of Lillies, & with oile of Sesamum, and afterwards to weare this plaister vpon it: Take Parsley, Smallage leaues and rootes, white Watermints, Marierom, of each one handfull, Comin, Caruway, and Dill séed, of each one ounce; beate them and frie them in the oile of Dill and of Rue, then make a plaister thereof and laie it vpon the kidneies: it is not onely good for all cold paines of the kidneies with winde, but also for the grauell and for the stone, and against all obstructions of the same which do proceede of cold. Of the obstructed Kidneies. §. 3. OVt of these forementioned reasons may easily be discerned, that the most causes of the paines of the kidneies be none other than coldnes and obstructions: for this, cold applications may be vsed, as the conserues of Marierom gentle which doth open all obstructions of the inner parts. In like manner also conserues of Betonie, confected rootes of Pimpernell, Eringus roots, and Calmus. Of wines be fit for this, Elecampane wine, Hyssop wine, aromaticall wine, and chiefly all spiced wine, as Claret wine, and Hippocras. Item, Betonie wine, Asarabacca wine, and wine of Marierom gentle. In like sort also all the distilled wines, or Aquae vitae of these herbes, also Meade, and Hony water. But he is much to be restrained from all puddle wines; for that
they not only obstruct the kidneies, but also all inward parts; they ingender grauell and the stone. Item: there is also a potion described in the twelfth chapter, and eleuenth §. of certaine rootes decocted which be also verie commodious for this disease. The great Treacle or Diatessaron if it be knowen how to giue them in good sort, are highly commended for this purpose. This powder following is also verie good and méete for to open the obstructions of the kidneies, and to expell the cold: Take Annis, Fennell, Millet, Smallage seed, of each one quarter of an ounce, Spica romana halfe a dragme, Licorice three dragmes, Dra∣gagant, Gum of the Cherrie trée, of each one quarter of an ounce: beate them to powder, and take thereof about the second day alwaies one dragme with wine. This sirupe following hath an especiall propertie in deopilating of the obstructed kidneis: to wit, Miua citoniorum, Aromatica, and Oxymel of squils with other moe described before. The Simples which do open these obstructions, be Agarick, Saxifrage, Milium Solis, Parsly of Macedonia, or stone Parsley, white Mustard séed, Nettle séed, red Pease porrage, Fennell rootes, Parsley rootes, and rootes of Sperage, of Smallage, and of Butchers broome, Spicanardi, Spica romana, water Cresses, garden Cresses, and Pingles; the compounds are Diacalaminthum, Electuarium Ducis, and Philantropon. Of the paine in the Kidneies through heate and drieth. §. 4. THe signes of these hot diseases of the kidneies, are such as that they may be per∣ceiued by the heate in féeling, and all cold things are welcome to the patient, and hot things contrarie vnto him, vnlesse the fulnesse of the bodie doth hinder and let them. The patient hath also great thirst at all times, and a bad stomacke; his vrine is verie little and high coloured; there swimmeth otherwhiles some fat vpon it, and the rather in yoong, cholerick, and hot men; with the hot paine of the kidneies is more danger than with the cold: Therefore must one without all delaie proceed forward with all necessarie remedies; and that much rather, for that through the foresaid heate (which is mixed with a tough thicke phlegma∣ticke matter) the stone of the kidneies might easily grow, wherein first the liuer veine is to be opened, afterwards the Saphea, and such clisters to be ministred as may clense the guts, that is, such as be decocted with Quinces and dates. This following is to be oftentimes vsed: Take Goates milke twelue or sixteene ounces, melt in it Goates suet one ounce, oile of Roses two ounces, and vse them as the other. For preparatiue potions you are to make this: Take Let∣tice, Purslaine, Liuerwoort, shepheards purse, of each one handfull, the seeds of Lettice, of Pur∣slaine, Endiue, Roses, Butchers broome séed, Barberies, water Lillies, burnt Iuorie, red and white Saunders, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar twelue ounces, then make a sirupe of it. You are afterwards to purge with sower Dates, with Cassie, with Manna, and with Succo Rosaram. Also for this (like as in the paine of the kidneies through cold) is néedfull a good order of diet. Therefore is his dwelling to be high from the ground, and not on the water, but to open to∣wards the East and the North, and not towards the South or against the West. His clothes are to hang loose on his bodie, and not girt tight or hard. Venery is also very hurtfull for this disease. Out of these foresaid reasons may easily be noted, that sore labor is hurtfull; as to ride hard trotting horses, to goe vp hils and staires, and that chiefly after meate. Notwithstanding moderate exercise is more commendable than to sit still vtterly vnoccupyed. Also anger, heaui∣nes of mind, and all other motions of the same are to be eschued. One must not eate too much, for this sicknes is caused most of all through ouercharging of the stomack; or gluttony; sléeping or waking must also be moderate: for to vse too much of either of them is hurtfull. But one must chiefly refraine from lying much vpon his backe, for thereby will the humours sincke much towards these partes: therefore is the first sléepe to bee done on the right side, and then finish it on the left side. To his meate and drinke must bée taken some more héede: he must eschue all olde and vnleauened bread, olde flesh, and all hearbes which make grosse humors, as Béetes, Colewoorts, &c. All hot and tarte meates, as salt flesh, Garlick, Onions, Léekes, and Radishes shall he forsake. In like maner must he not vse the things that doe vehe∣mently force vrine; as Fennell, Parsly, Smallage, and such like. But he may not eate bread
which is light and leauened, and is two or thrée daies old. Hens, Pullets, wild Ducks, yoong Pigeons, Fesants, Partridges &c. will be his best meates: but he must forsake all water foules. Yoong Bucks flesh, Veale, Lambe, young Mutton, Conies, Hares, and wilde Swines flesh may he eate very well, and especially yoong Hogs flesh is much commended for this disease. The fruits and herbs are Barly pap, wheaten pap, Colewoorts, Spinage, Gourds, Cucumbers, Melons, Abricocks, greene Fennell, and aboue all, Sage and Betonie. And in fine, all that hath a saltish and opening power, and not hot aboue the second degrée, all sorts of Cherries, and especially the kernels of the same, be good for to cleanse the kidneies, and to breake the stone. In like manner also Hasell nuts, fresh Almonds, and Figs that be well dryed, and Rai∣sons be altogither much commended. This patient may eate sower Apples (but no swéete) and also Peaches. He must refraine from Peares (if they be not very sweete, and the stones taken out of them) Pistacies, Pingles, (and sometimes nuts) be commended: but Chestnuts, Medlars, and Seruices are hurtfull. Of all milke, Shéepes milke is the very best for the kid∣neies, and next to that Goates milke: but aboue all other, the whay of milke. But the first milke after caluing or Colostra must be eschewed, except that of shéepe and goates. Butter is not much commended, but Sallad oile is much more requisite. Cheese is vtterly to be refrai∣ned, for it hath an especiall nature to ingender grauell, vnlesse that it be permitted otherwhiles for custome sake, and that it be Cheese of a yéere old, which is drie, well salted, and not rotten. And alwaies in the end of the mealetide, of confected fruits, Oliues, and Rapes, of Brimswicke are most healthfull, and Sisarum, Quinces, Ginger, Walnuts, conserues of Pionie, of Burrage, Buglosse, of Roses, water Lillies, and especially of Cicorie, which do open the obstruction and clense. Item, Vineger, the iuice of Citrons, of Limons, halfe sower, halfe swéete, Pomegra∣nates be also verie meete for this maladie, but veriuce is forbidden. Of spices and séeds these are good, Cinnamome, Pepper, Ginger, Saffron, Annis, Caruway, Louage séed, Ameos, Rue seed; but a little of each for meates. The drinke for this patient shall be white wine, or light red wine which is not hard nor sower, but of a good and pleasant taste. The Cherrie wine doth not onely coole and moisten a∣lone the kidneies, but also the inward parts of the bodie, therefore may the same be fréely drun∣ken. Preserued Cherries do also the same. Thus much haue we meant to speake of the order of diet for those that be plagued and vexed with the Grauell, which may be augmented or diminished according to the qualitie of the cause. How to asswage the paine in the Kidneies. §. 5. WE will speake now first of all of some particular things which haue a secret vertue for to conueigh the medicines into the kidneies and bladder: viz. Saxi∣frage, Milium Solis, Parsley of Macedonia, and stone Parsley, Cantharides, the rootes of Fennell, Sperage and Butchers broomeseed, of Melons, Gourds, Cu∣cumbers, and Pompeons. These following haue power for to coole the kid∣neies: viz. Lettice séeds, the séeds of Purslaine, Endiue, white Poppie seed, Tassell, iuice of Quinces, broad Plantaine, and such like. The compounded things are the sirupe of water Lillies, of Vineger, and all that cooleth the liuer and the spléene, whereof is written before. Afterwards you haue in the third part in the beginning of the eight Chapter, sundrie things which are also good and verie méete, therefore are you not to leaue them vnread. But if you will haue yet more, then looke what is written of Diabete. If any body then do méete with this disease, or feare to get the same; then must he take the vtmost gréene pils of Beanes, and distill water of them, and drinke thereof two ounces tem∣pered with Sugar. Other do temper amongst it as much water of Hounds toong, and so vse it euerie daie. Take oile of Violets, of water Lillies, and such like cooling things, and annoint therewith the kidneies. You haue also in the beginning of the foresaid eight Chapter, a salue called Anodyna, which asswageth all paines. Item: Take the oile of Violets two ounces, oyle of Sesamum,
and of swéet Almonds of each one ounce and a halfe, Butter one ounce, Saffron one drag, and a halfe, Waxe one ounce and a halfe, Dill séed, Cammomill, Ducks grease, of each halfe an ounce, thrée yolks of Egs; temper them all togither, and make a salue thereof. Another. Take Elderne oyle one ounce, oyle of Roses and of Violets, of each halfe an ounce, Ceruse one ounce and a quarter, Rose water one ounce, two yolks of Egs, Waxe fiue ounces: The oyle and Waxe must be molten togither; and let them séeth a little: when it is almost cold, then mixe the other things amongst it; and at the last the two yolks of egs, and ten dragmes of fine Bolus, and afterwards stirre it well about. This salue is maruellous good for all ouer heated Kidneies, and especially if one after the annoynting do lay water Lilly leaues vpon it. Likewise doth the Saunders salue expell all hot matter and distemperature of the Kidneies: like as the same is described in the sixt Chapter and 1. §. Item, take the Saunders salue, and of that which is called Comitissae, of each halfe an ounce, oyle of Violets one quarter of an ounce; temper them all togither, and annoynt the Kidneies with it twice or thrice a day. The Rose salue which is described in the first part, the second chapter, and first §. and other moe which be noted in the second part, the fourth chapter and 3. §. are altogither méete for this purpose. Item, take Roses, Purslaine, of each one handfull, séeth them in Cow milke, and stampe them to growt: ad vnto it red Saunders powdred two dragmes, oyle of Roses as much as you will for to make a salue of it. Item take oyle of Oliue and fresh Butter, of each halfe an ounce, the iuice of Veronica, of Milium Solis, and Marierom gentle, of each thrée dragmes: let them séeth togither vntill the iuice be consumed. This salue is much commended. Or take the foresaid herbs, and séeth them in oyle or grease, and wring them through a cloth. Take Rose water and oyle of Roses, of each one ounce, Vineger one spoonefull, the white of an egge, and bray them well togither, and lay it blood warme ouer the Kidneies. If the paine will not thereby be eased, then let him weare a leaden plate, full of holes, vpon the Kidneies continually: it taketh away the heate and venery. If one perceiue any grauell in the Kidneies, then cut a Radish in thin slices, and frie it in Goose grease, & lay it on the kidneies. In fine, for all such enflaming of the Raynes, there is nothing better then to bathe, and chiefely in all such waters as do run ouer iron mines. You are also to looke how to strengthen the sto∣macke in this disease: looke for that in the eleuenth Chapter and the 4. §. vnto the end thereof, where is shewed at large what strengtheneth the stomack with heat or with cold. For this, also is conuenient all that hereafter shall be written of the grauell and the stone of the Kidneyes. Of an hard Impostume in the Kidneies. §. 6. THe Grecians do call this disease Scleros. The same may also be caused through two manner of meanes: First, if the matter of the impostume begin to harden through great heate, and to alter into a stone: Or that at the first it be an impostume of Melancholicke humours, which is especially caused of cold that hardneth the matter. The signes of the said impostumes are sorenes, or heauines about the place of the kidneies with little or no paine at all, whereby the members do grow leane. The vrine is wholly cleare, rawe, and verie little: and although it be (as many famous Phisitions do af∣firme) that this disease is not to be holpen, yet are you to vse all things for it which be here before described for the hardnes of the Milt and Liuer. And first of all he is to be purged, the Saphea or Liuer vaine is to be opened, and afterwards the kidneies to be annointed with Hens grease, with the marrow of Neats féete, or with the salue Althea. And afterwards this plaister following is to be applied vpon it: Take Linséed, and Fenegréeke, of each fiue dragms, Mallowes, Hollyhocke seed, Dill séed, and Cammomill, of each halfe an ounce, Gum, Bdellium, and Turpentine, of each thrée dragmes. First dissolue the Gum in warme water, afterwards temper the rest amongst it, and so make a plaister of it. If so be then the patient haue any went of stooles, then is Cassie or Manna to be vsed for it. This disease of the kidneies doth make also oftentimes that one cannot hold his water, yea that otherwise it passeth away from the pati∣ent vnwittingly in his sléepe, whereof we will hereafter speake and discourse a part.
Of impostumes and vlcers in the Kidneies. §. 7. WHat difference is betwéene the impostumes and vlcers of the kidneies, it is suf∣ficiently declared in the eleuenth chapter, and twentie nine §. bicause that the kidneies be subiect to both of these maladies. Therefore we will discourse of them seuerally, and speake first of the impostumes, and therewith also shew all that concerneth both these diseases. Notwithstanding that both these diseases, of Hippocrates, of Galen, and of all other learned be thought to be incurable, or that at the leastwise the same could not without great industrie and long time be holpen; for which they alleage many reasons; yet are there neuerthelesse many kind of meanes found, whereby the paine may be asswaged. And if so be that the same maladies thereby could not be thorowly and perfectly healed, yet may one staie them that they do not grow and waxe worse. Now then concerning the outward remedies of this disease, you haue for it salues, plaisters, and other meanes before for to laie vpon it, wherewith is this re∣medie also much commended: which is, that one is to laie tow ouer all his priuities being wetted in the braied yolks of egs, and to refresh and renew the same often. We must also speake here somewhat of the causes of the impostume, and shew first that the kidneies and the bladder in this paine do depend so much one vpon the other that they can∣not be discerned one from the other: therefore all that we shall write hereafter is fit for both these parts. These foresaid impostumes may procéede aswell out of cold as hot matter, which commeth to fall vpon the Kidneies and the bladder, and there to assemble. But if any outward cause do happen vnto it, as blowes, fals, ridings, and such like, that must be learned of the sicke person. If the impostume be in the kidneies, then is there great paine in the same place, the patient can∣not make his water, and there is a small ague with it. Or if the disease be in the bladder, then doth there arise a very painfull swelling about the priuities, like to womens pangs in child bed, chiefly if it be a hot matter, which causeth also an ague. And if this do come through cold, then is the paine and the ague more tolerable, but the making of water very grieuous, and this dis∣ease lingreth long. But in case that the impostume be in the right kidney, then doth the paine draw vpwards: or if it be in the left kidney, then doth the paine stretch downewards euen to the bladder; the patient hath one while cold hands, another while cold féet: and his legs on the same side will be for the most part asléepe. Also the sick person cannot lie vpon the whole side, but must lie vpon his backe, or his side where the maladie is. There doth come also oftentimes great binding of the body, with the first headach, watching, rednes of the eyes and face, heauie breath, and especially if the impostume be in the membranes. And if the patient do stir himselfe forcibly, then thinketh he that the impostume hangeth or sacketh. But before we come to the remedies, there be certaine rules which are to be obserued in such like impostumes. First, in the beginning he must beware of giuing too strong purgations. Secondly, only laxatiue things are to be vsed: as Violets, Cassie, and such like. Thirdly, if so be that the patient be plethoricke of body, you must open the Liuer vaine or Saphea. Fourthly, there must not be giuen vnto him, so long as the impostume is not ripe, any thing that forceth vrine: for therby would the humors be driuen to sinke the more vehemently vpon the kidneies, or into some other part of the bodie, whereby the disease might be increased. Fiftly, one must endeuour that the humors which do flow towards the kidneies, may be conueyed into the out∣termost members. Sixtly, and that by reason that the kidneies should not harden. Seuenthly, when the impostume is thorow ripe (which may be perceiued by the vrine) then is there to be giuen him diureticall and strong things. Eightly, if the body be bound, then must he not be let blood; likewise also if he haue too many stooles: but all accidents are to be preuented & matched before. Ninthly, because that the kidneies be so far distant from the necke of the stomacke; therefore are the medicines which are to be taken by the mouth, so to be composed, that their vigor, through so long a distance and passage, be not enféebled and abated. Tenthly, all they that haue any disease in the kidneies, are to eate and drinke but little, chiefly if there be many humors in the body present. Eleuenthly, if so be that the disease of the kidneies may be holpen with any milde things, then must there be no strong things to knit & draw them togither that
they cannot come to any corruption. Therefore are temperate things to be vsed vnto it, and warme and cold things to be mixed togither. Of the impostumation in the Kidneies through heate. §. 8. ANd for to come to the remedies; if so that this impostume be caused through heate, then is it first to be opened with Clisters, as hereafter followeth: Take Mallowes, Violet leaues, and Hollyhocke rootes, of each one handfull, Linseed, Fenegreeke seed, of each two ounces; seeth them all togither, and take of this decoction twelue or sixteene ounces, oyle of Violets three ounces, oyle of Roses three ounces, for to strengthen the kidneies: make a Clister thereof, and you are to vse the same three or fower times, if it be needfull: Or take Barly water alone, with the foresaid oyle, or Sallad oyle. But if there be any laske or scouring with it, then vse binding Clisters, and such as do strengthen the intrailes, whereof euery where be diuers discouered. Also the lyuer veine is to be opened in those sick persons on the same side, and that in the acme where the disease is. Secondly, if the patient may sustaine it, the veine is to be opened in the hammes or bending of the knée. Or if it be not to be found, then to take or open the Saphea, and that alwayes in the side where the impostume is. Afterwards cooling salues are to be vsed, or those plaisters to be laid vpon it which we haue lately described. And if the sicknes come to diminish therewith, then is it a good signe: but if the paine and the Ague do continue still, and the patient cannot make any water, or that it passe too excéedingly away from him, then is it a signe that there is an assembly of corruption in the Kidneyes, against which you haue also a note before, what is to be done in these hot kind of accidents. For this is this plaister following good: Take Roses one ounce, the seed of Purslaine, and white Poppie seed, of each halfe an ounce, Sallad oyle three ounces, Barly meale as much as will suffice for to make a plaister. Item, take pouned Cammomill, and Linseed oyle, of each one ounce, oyle of Sesamum foure ounces, Bran as much as will suffice for to make a plaister: these being made, apply them on the Kidneies. Item, take the slime of Fleawort, and of Quince kernels, of each one quarter of an ounce, oyle of Roses two ounces, Endiue water sixe ounces, the seed of Purslaine, of white Poppie, and Vineger, of each halfe an ounce, Barly meale as much as is needfull for to make a plaister. Item, take Holyhock rootes, and Mallow rootes, of each one handfull, fresh Figs one ounce, the marrow of Veale bones, Butter, and Ducks grease, of each halfe an ounce, oyle of swéete Almonds, and of Cammomill, of each one ounce and a halfe, Cammomill and Balme floures, of each halfe an ounce, Barly meale, and wheate meale, as much as sufficeth for to make a plaister. This pap or plaister maturateth all im∣postumes. In the beginning of these impostumes giue the sicke persons Barly water or Meade to drinke, the water of Melons and Pompeons, tempered with Barly water the space of one wéeke. Other do ordaine this drinke: Take the sirupe of Violets, the muscilage of Fleawort, of Mallowes, of Hollyhock rootes, and the seeds of Cotton, of each halfe an ounce, Reisons (the stones taken out) one ounce, Licorice thrée dragmes, Sugar eighteene ounces: then make a sirupe of it, and temper a little of the iuice of Nightshade with it, and drinke it so with Barly water. This sirupe cooleth, and therefore it is very good against the Ague, which is alwayes present with this hote impostume; it relaxeth, clenseth, and asswageth the paine. Afterwards is the bodie to be purged with Cassie, sowre Dates, Manna, and such like. The Dyet. ALl such patients as haue a hote impostume in their Kidneyes, must (as it is sayd) kéepe themselues very sober in eating & drinking, and must eate none other but Barly paps, Hen brothes made sowre with Veriuice, stoued Spinage, Mallowes, Orage, Lettice,
Burrage, Almond milke, and yong Pullets decocted with Gourds, &c. And this is to continue so long, vntill it be openly séene and knowne that the impostume is ripe. If so be then the pati∣ent betwéene meales be troubled with any great thirst, then must be giuen vnto him sugred barly water to drinke. But if so be that the Ague be very small, and that the impostume be through cold Phlegma, then must he rather drinke Meade. But if there be great heate with it, then must he leaue flesh, and wine, alwayes at the first. But if the same be caused through cold, then may watred wine be allowed, but no flesh at all, chiefely Porke and Beefe; also Cheese, Pease, Beanes, vnleauened bread, and Rice, be for∣bidden. But all field fowles, rere egs, riuer fish, drest with Parsly rootes and salt, are permit∣ted for him. Of Impostumes in the Kidneyes through cold. §. 9. WE haue admonished before that all such impostumes of the Kidneyes may also procéede of cold, and whereby the same may be knowne. For this impostume are Clisters fit to be adhibited, and then to make afterwards this potion fol∣lowing. Take water Mints, Hyssope, Wormewood, rumpled Mints, Reisons, Ireas, of each one ounce, Caruway, Fennell, Endiue, small Endiue, of each one quarter of an ounce, Licorice halfe an ounce, Hony nine ounces: prepare it then, and vse it as other po∣tions. And if so be that after eight dayes there be many humors present, then first open his Lyuer veine, afterwards the Saphea, and purge the Phlegma with Diaturbith, and vse Clisters of hearbs which be mentioned in the first potion: but put Mallowes vnto it, Hollyhock rootes, and Cammomill; also oyle of Cammomill and of Nardus. After the taking of this Clister, the patient is to lye very high with his tayle, that the Clister may the better runne towards the Raynes. Of the Exulceration in the Kidneyes. §. 10. THese Exulcerations may as well come in the Kidneyes, as in any other places of the bodie, where they with their matter and corrosion do take away the naturall operation of the Kidneyes. The causes of these vlcers may be blowes, falles, wounds, and such like: as also bloud, and other humors, which descend thither∣wards, and do there exulcerate and open the Kidneyes and the bladder through their sharpnes. Item, if that any impostumation of the Kidneyes be not thorowly healed: Item, through the grauell and the stone that do bruse the Kidneyes within: also of the vse of all hote meates and spices, and of eating salt, and by doing ouergreat labour in the heate of the Sunne. All these former causes may ingender some sharp humors which fall afterwards vpon the Kidneyes, and there do corrode and exulcerate them. The signes of these vlcers are corruption, and bloud, with tough slime, as if they were small vaines péeces, as it were flesh, which do passe away with the vrine. If so be that there be any eate with it, that is knowne by the thirst and by the féeling. The signes of the Stone are to be found in their proper place. If so be that the disease of the Kidneyes and the bladder, with other mo such like diseases, do agrée so néere together that the same may be hardly discerned, yet we will neuertheles disco∣uer certaine especiall signes of it. For the diseases of the Kidneyes there is no griefe in making water, like as there is in the disease of the Bladder, wherein the water is made with paine and longsome. In the vlcers of the Kidneyes are alwayes found in the vrine small péeces of flesh like small red Corans; where to the contrary, in the vlcers of the bladder, there auoid great and white péeces. If so be that any skalines be pist out with bloud, and corruption which stinketh, then doth such come out of the bladder: like as contrarywise, that which commeth frō the Kidneyes doth not stinke. In the exulceration of the Bladder is losse of a little bloud; but in the vlcers of the Kidneyes much. If so be then that the Kidneyes haue any disease, then doth the patient feele paine about the Raynes: and in the disease of the bladder, there doth the patient féele paine a∣boue
the priuities. The corruption which commeth out of the Kidneyes is mixt together with the vrine, and doth settle in an howres space not to the bottome of the glasse: where contrarily all that which commeth from the bladder doth separate it selfe forthwith from the vrin, setling to the bottome of the glasse. We are also to alledge certaine common rules for this: as first, if there be any yong chole∣rick person which feeleth paine in the water conduits, that the same must be forbidden Wine. Secondly, for as much as these vlcers do chiefely procéede through the falling downe of any sharpe humors, then it is needfull that their sharpnes and heate be alayed with swéete things. Thirdly, one must refraine from all hote, sharp, salt, bitter, and sowre things, and to vse all that is to the contrary of them. Fourthly, to drinke too much, whether it be Wine or Béere is hurt∣full, that one be not thereby constrained to make much water. Fiftly, Venerie, great labour, and exercise, be very hurtfull for this disease, for that the parced Kidneyes cannot be thorowly hea∣led without rest and quiet. Sixtly, if so be there be nothing that may hinder the letting of bloud, then is the same very profitable, as be also all great purgations. Seuenthly, by reason that vo∣miting maketh the matter to haue recourse vnto another place, therefore is it not to be taken to be vnprofitable for this disease. Eightly, if there be great paine with this vlceration, then must diligence be giuen first to asswage the same paine, and afterwards looke well how to cure and cleanse this disease. Ninthly, for to heale this disease, one must first begin with things which prouoke vrine gently, whereby the Kidneyes may be a little clensed. Tenthly, all medi∣cins which are to be taken for the diseased Kidneyes, whether it be by vomit, or otherwise, must be alwayes done fasting, and he must also fast long after it. Eleuenthly, after the mundification of the vlcers, astringent and healing things are to be taken tempered alwayes with exsiccatiue medicaments. Thus for to heale these vlcers these are the right meanes: If so be that the pati∣ent be hard bounden, then is he to be loosed with gentle Clisters. Accordingly, if he be full of bloud, he must first haue his Lyuer veine, and afterwards the Saphea to be opened. For his drinke, the patient is to vse Hony water, or to make this drinke following: Take twelue oun∣ces of peeled Barly, Fennell rootes, Smallage rootes, and Maydenhaire, of each one handfull: séeth them all together in two pots of water vntill that the Barly be well swollen. After∣wards take twelue ounces of Hony, and boyle it all together with the foresaid decoction, but scumme it well, and drinke thereof. If so be that the vlcer be great, and that there be néede of stronger things, then put Ireos, Hyssope, and Horehound, of each two ounces, and a good pints of water more. But if there be but a small vlcer which hath not long continued, then take Mal∣lowes, Hollyhock séeds, the séeds of Melons and of Pompeons, of each a like much. But you must péele the séeds, and giue thereof thrée dragmes at one time tempered with Meade. After∣wards shall he vrge himselfe to vomit once euery fourth day. Let this much suffice, as briefely spoken of the vlcers of the Kidneyes. Of the pissing of Bloud. §. 11. FOr as much as this pissing of bloud may be caused as well of the vlcers in the Kidneyes, as in the Lyuer, therefore we will describe it héere in this Chapter. The pissing of bloud is of two sorts: the one, when one pisseth faire cleane bloud: the other, when the same is mixed with matter or corruption. This pissing of bloud, commeth of inward and outward causes. The outward may be caused through falles, blowes, strong riding, insatiable venerie, great labour, of certaine meates, drinks, wounds, of a concourse of melancholick humors which are wont to be driuen out through womens Termes, or through the Pyles. Of the inward causes are superfluitie, sharpnes of humors and of the vrine, winds, tumors, impostumes, debilitie of the Kidneyes, and of the Bladder: then doth he féele the paine aboue the priuities, and the bloud is con∣gealed, and separated from the vrine. In case that the bloud be much, and runneth out swiftly, then doth it signifie a broken veine: but if it come out slow or longsome, then an vlcer: but if the vrine be like water wherein fresh flesh is washed, then it is of a weakened Lyuer: and if so be that it do come of a superfluous bloud, then is the same to be séene by the fulnes of the bodie: but if it come through the sharpnes of the humors, then doth the patient féele a continuall bur∣ning. But before we do come to the particular remedies, it is néedfull that we do make decla∣ration
of certaine common rules. First, if so be that the maladie be new, then aboue all things is the liuer veine to be opened, and afterwards (if the cause require, and that the patient be strong inough) the Saphea is to be opened, thereby to driue the blood to another place. Secondly, in the beginning are not astringent nor binding things to be vsed, that the blood may not con∣geale and coole, but he must first beginne with such things as do cleanse the water conduits. Thirdly, if this pissing of blood do come as an expulsion of superfluitie, or Crisis, then is it not to be stayed, if it be not so that thereby the naturall powers be ouermuch weakened. Fourthly, whensoeuer the pissing of blood, whether it be caused of the Liuer, Kidneyes or Bladder, is tho∣roughly cleansed, then is the same blood to be holpen with cold and astringent things, and to mixe amongst them Anodines. Fiftly, all such patients are to eschue great labor, venery, hot drinks, all spices, and all hote things. Now for to come to the remedies of the same, then it is to be con∣sidered whether this pissing of blood do procéed of outward causes, which may well be perceiued by the sicke person, and is also to be remedied. First of all, whether this pissing of blood haue continued long or not. Of the pissing of blood which hath not long continued, we haue hitherto spoken. But in old pissing of blood, one must begin according to the contents of the other rules, with the clensing of the vreters, which is to be done through these meanes: Take Maidenhaire foure handfuls, Melon séed one ounce and a halfe, Sugar and honie, of each nine ounces: make a cléere sirupe of it, and giue it with water wherein Melon séede is decocted. Another which is very good. Take foure handfuls of Cinkfoile, Sugar 9. ounces; séeth the herbes in sufficient water, then wring it out, & with sugar make thereof a sirupe. This sirupe is to be giuen with water wherein Plantaine is decocted: this sirupe healeth & cleanseth certainly. If any one fall or be beaten, whereby a veine is broken in the bodie; the liuer veine is then to be opened, for that thereby the blood will be drawne backe which doth run out of these places. But if that the blood do auoide in abundance, and that the patient be strong enough, then is the Saphea to be opened the second day afterwards: and to the end that the blood which lieth clotted in the water conduits might be caried forth, then giue to the sicke bodie a potion wherein Fen∣nell rootes, the rootes of Smallage, Dragon rootes, Ireos, Hissope, Maidenhaire and Ciceres be sodden; afterwards one dragme, or one dragme and a halfe of Trociscis de Carabe may be giuen him with water wherein the seedes of Butchers broome and such like is decocted, or the Trocisci de terra sigillata. For this is also méete the confection of Philonium Persicum, but it is not to be vsed without the aduise of a learned Phisition. Some do also take thrée quarters of an ounce of the conserue of Roses, and temper amongst it seuen graines of Henbane seed, and two scruples of prepared Corall, which may be vsed with stéeled water. It is also very fit to vse otherwhiles one ounce or one ounce and a halfe of Cassie, and chiefly if there be heate with it. We haue spoken before of the letting of blood, and therupon are to giue to this sicke person a profitable purgation of Rubarbe in substance which is beaten, and not wrong out, but in powder with plantaine water: afterwards giue him one dragme of beaten horsetaile, and one quarter of an ounce of plantaine water, and strew all his meates with the same water. All his flesh is to be sodden with Butchers broome séed and vnripe Grapes. He is alwaies to beware of all sharpe, tart and salt things, and lay a plaister on the place of the maladie made of Bolus and the iuice of Sloes, Aloe, Lycium, Vineger and Rose water. If you will haue moe reme∣dies, then looke into the former §. of the impostumes and vlcers of the kidneys. And although al the same were caused of other meanes, yet shall you find also thrée remedies méete for the same. And if so be that this bléeding be caused through any sharpe meate, or any composed wind, then is the patient to order himselfe, as of the letting of blood, and taking of the foresaid Trociscis is beforesaid. But if there be any impostume or vlcer of the kidneyes with it that may be séene by the matter and blood: therefore haue you hereafter all that is requisite for the pissing of matter. If any man pisse matter. §. 12. THe pissing of matter must proceede out of the bladder, kidneyes, or some of the vppermost parts, as from some vlcer of the sides, vlcer of the lights, the liuer, &c. the which may procéede from some outward causes, as of blowes, falles, wounds, strong diureticall medicines, and such like. The inward causes may be vn∣cleane
impostumes, vlcers, superfluous, tough and grosse humors, wind or stone, which do set∣tle there and make some excoriation. The signes of these accidents may be perceiued easily by the paine of the same place, and by the declaration of the patient. This infirmitie is thus to be holpen: Take peeled Melon séede, Cucumber séede, Gourd seede, and Pompeon seede, of each one ounce and a quarter, fine Bolus, Gummi Arabicum. Frankinsence, and Dragon bloud, of each fiue dragmes, Opium one dragme and a halfe, the seede of Smallage one dragme: make Tro∣ciskes thereof with the muscilage of Quince kernels, and giue the sicke folkes euery day the waight of one quarter of an ounce with the sirupe of Poppie heads. For this is also to be vsed consolidating and mundifying things, as hereafter followeth: Take péeled Melon séed, the seed of Hollihockes and Nightshade, of each halfe an ounce, bitter Almonds, Pompeon seede, fresh Maiden haire, Ireos, and Licorice, of each halfe a dragme: make a confection thereof with Su∣gar, or with cleare honie. For mundification are also fit, Barley water, meade, the decoction of figs, of Horehound, and Maiden haire decocted with milke. Now for to heale, you are to take great and small Comfrey, of each one quarter of an ounce, Dragon bloud, Frankinsence, Ma∣sticke, and fine Bolus, of each one dragme, parched Rubarbe, the iuice of Sloes, and Mirtle seede, of each halfe a dragme, Indie Spica halfe a scruple, Sugar as much as you please, make a confection thereof. This sirupe following may also be prepared: Take Licorice one quarter of an ounce, Maidenhaire and Hounds ribbe, of each two handfuls, peeled Melon séede, Pempeon séede, Cucumber seede, and Gourd séede, of each one dragme, white Poppie séede, Hollihocke seede, and muscilage of Quince kernels, of each halfe an ounce, Dragagant and Gum, of each thrée dragmes, Rubarbe, Roses of each one ounce and a halfe, white Sugar nine ounces; make a cleare sirupe of it. The Trocisci de Alkekengi, which is of winter Cherries, are surpassing god in this disease; and not onely for this, but also for all other diseases of the kidneyes: giue one dragme thereof, or one dragme and a halfe with Goates milke or Plantaine water. Also for this disease is Hony water to be spouted into the yard: and when the patient hath kept it in a certain season and pist it out againe, then is this following to be vsed: Take Ceruse, Sarco∣colla, Gum, Frankinsence, Opium, Dragon blood, of each halfe a scruple; temper it with foure oun∣ces of womans milke, and spout one ounce thereof at one time through the yard. In like man∣ner shall he drinke Radish water, and water of Horse radish, or spout it in. For this must also this order obserued, to wit, that he now vse consolidating, & then againe mundifying things, and do alter them according as occasion serueth. Item, take oile of Roses two ounces, oile of Myrtle, and the iuice of Plantaine, of each one quarter of an ounce, Trociscorum de Terra sigillata, de Carabe, of each one dragme, Vineger one quarter of an ounce, Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make a salue. This salue for the pissing of blood and water, is to be rubbed on the place of the Kidneyes, and also round about the priuities aboue and beneath, begin rubbed well in, and then well couered with warme clothes. Of outward vlcers of the Kidneyes. §. 13. THese vlcers outwardly in the Kidneies, are wont to be cause if one lie vpon his backe, then are the places of the Kidneyes red, and do come to exulcerate. Now when this is perceiued, then is there a plaister to be made with the meale of Millet and with Pannick meale, and be laid thereon, and then are you to strew it with Willow leaues, and to moisten the heated place with cold Rose water, or to lay any cooling things vpon it. These salues following are also méete for this, viz. salue of Ceruse, Poplar salue, Sanders salue, & other cooling salue of Galen, vine leaues stéeped in Rose water, and thinne beaten Led also which is full of holes worne vpon the raines. Item, take oile of Roses tempered with a little vineger and laid often vpon it. If that there do then appeare bladder or blisters which do breake open, then are they to be cured with cooling salues, and dried vp with the salue of Ceruse or Album coctum. All these foresaid sicknesse and diseases are the true messengers of the most grieuous disease of the Stone or grauell of the Bladder and the Kidneyes, whereof we will hereafter further discourse and write. But we will first of all prescribe a briefe order of diet for all them that be infected with these terrible diseases, as the paine of the Kidneyes, impostumes, and vlcers.
The ordre of diet. §. 14. ALl meates of milke, or wheate meale, of the crums of bread, barley paps, oaten paps, are very commodious for this disease. In like manner all field fowles which are to be eaten, as Partridges, Phesants, Doues, Turtle doues, Kids, and yong mutton, if it be vtterly without an Ague: but if so be that there be a great heate with it, then is he to vse Melons and Peaches which be very ripe. Hasell nuts, Almonds, Pistacies, Pingles, and such like may he also eate. Item, yong hens, rere egges, hen-broth wherein purslaine, Lettice, Melon séede, Pompeons, Gourds, Cucum∣bers, or any other cooling things haue bene sodden: all riuer fish that haue scales, frayed, are to be tolerated. Gréene herbes, as Orage, Mallowes, purslaine, and Lettice, are also very méete for him. His best drinke were indéed Barley water; but if he will drinke Wine, and so there be no Ague with it, then may he drinke good thicke red Wine tempered with water. Asses milke is maruellous good for him; and if the same cannot be gotten, then may one take Goates milke. It is before admonished that euery such patient is to beware of all sharpe, hote, bitter, and swéete things, and chiefly of all fruite, whether they be gréene or dried. The seuenteenth Chapter. Of the Grauell, Sand, or Stone of the Kidneyes, and of the Bladder. THis stone or grauell hath his principall ofspring in the Kidneyes, in the Bladder, and seldome in the hollownesse of other inward parts, as of the Liuer, &c. The cause of it, is commonly by inheritance, like as the Gout or Podagra, the Leprosie, and other moe. Also these disease do come through a weake Stomacke and Liuer, that ingender much tough and grosse slime. In like sort also of a foggie aire, surfetting by meate or drink, the feeding of ouermuch slimie meates, the which do obstruct not only be kidneyes, but also all other inward parts, as hath bene said, and hinder them that they cannot haue their right operation: the which may euidently be seene in young children, which are most subiect to this disease, for that they eate much milke, whereby the stone and grauell is most of all ingendred, of which the grossest sinketh into the bladder with the v∣rine, where the same lieth and drieth, and is confirmed to the hardnesse of a stone: like as we for example cannot otherwise liken this foresaid grosse matter of the stone, then with the mat∣ter of a tile stone, which is first a weake tough slimie earth, afterwards dried, and at last burnt and baked in an ouen to a hard stone. The stone of the bladder differeth also much from the stone of the kidneyes, for it is whither, harder, and greater then the stone of the kidneyes. This foresaid stone or grauell is knowne by these signes. Lieth he in the Bladder? then must the patient often rub his priuities with his hand, his member is alwayes erected. Also in yong children, they féele most paine about their priuities: the vrine passeth from him with labour and very great vaine, and otherwhiles the Arsegut thereby descendeth. But if it be the stone of the kidneyes, then do they feele great paine in the raines of the backe, as it were the Colicke or paine of the guts, because that the paine draweth downewards. As sóone as they stirre themselues, then doth the paine increase: they are much inclined to vomiting and casting, their body is bound, their vrine is raw and waterish, they are alwayes prouoked to pisse, neuertheles they cannot be rid of it without very great paine: therefore can this growing and confirmation of the stone in these parts of the kidneyes not be without great paine and griefe. It is also eui∣dently and sufficiently wel knowne to each mans eyes, where the paine remaineth in one place that the vrine doth auoid withe grauell, sand, tough slime, yea sometimes mixt with blood and o∣ther things, and the kidneyes be full of heate. Afterwards this griefe and paine stretched euen to the conduits of the vrine, and principally in fat folks, and before euen to the priuities, and then especially when they would make water. But because there be many decieued in the knowledge of the stone, and adiudge otherwhiles the Colicke for the Stone, and so come to vse contrary medicines; therefore it is not without great néed that we make a declaration of both their differences.
The first is this, that the paine of the Kidneyes is not so sharpe as the paine of the Colicke. Secondly, the paine of the Colick doth appeare beneath in the right side, and stretched her from thence vpwards towards the left side. Contrariwise, the paine of the kidneyes doth begin from aboue, and so descendeth softly downewards euen vnto the place where it doth settle it self, and stretched her a little more towards the back. Thirdly, the paine of the kidneyes is much more forcible when he is fasting, and the paine of the Colicke is by fasting and emptinesse eased. Fourthly, the Colicke commeth vpon a sudden: and to the contrary, the paine of the kidneyes commeth in a longer time. Fiftly, the Colicke will be taken and driuen away, when the wind and the ordure may haue their expulsion or auoidance by Clisters, but the paine of the grauell not. Sixtly, all Saxifrages and all other things that breake the stone, are good for the kidneyes and not for the Colicke. Lastly, there is found in the vrine grauell and sand, and not in the Co∣licke or paine of the guts. By all these foresaid declarations one may easily adiudge whether this diseases be in the kid∣neyes or in the bowels. For to hinder and restraine the ingendring and growing of the grauell and stone. §. 1. ANd that we may orderly proceede herein, héede is first of all to be taken how the matter, whence the sand and stone is ingendred, may be taken away, and how that the vnnatural heate may be tempered, the which is first to be done through those things that do purge the same matter, as hereafter followeth. Take Electuarium Indum thrée dragmes, Agaricus one scruple, Ginger fiue graines, temper them with a little white wine, & drinke it vp, and fast therupon foure houres, then drinke a cruse of sugred Barley water, and eate foure houres after it. Or take Electuarium Diaphoeniconis one quarter of an ounce, Turbith one dragme, Ginger one scruple, salt of Indy thrée graines, giue it him with water wherein Milium Solis is decocted, and then made warme with Sugar. One more milder: Take Turbith one dragme and a halfe, Hermodactili one dragme, Diagridij sixe graines, Salt of Indie two graines, Ginger halfe a scruple, Annis and Masticke, of each thrée graines, Sugar pennets one ounce, white Sugar halfe an ounce, stéepe them all together in thrée ounces of the water of Smallage or the water of Maidenhaire throughout the whole night; after that wring it out well and drinke it; if so be that there appeare any phlegmaticke matter, then may the patients veine be opened: but if so be that the matter fal into the stomack, then is it aduised that the patient be made to vomit, and how the same is to be effected, looke for that in the Register: for that through vomiting the matter will be especially drawne away which would runne towards the raines. For this vomiting, be Radishes, Orage séeds, the mid∣dlemost peeles of Elder, and Nux vomica to be vsed. Some vse Clisters, but they must be very easie and mild; but Suppositories are much more praised for this disease. Item, all things which moue vrine, do also let and hinder the growing of the stone or grauel. But first the mildest are to be begun withall, like as with these following, as Licorice, &c. and where as is heate, Melon séed, pompeon séede, Gourd séede, Cucumber séede, Sperage rootes or the water of them, fresh fennell, Hollihocke rootes and the flowers. Afterwards are stronger things to be vsed, as Smallage, Maidenhaire, drie fennell, yellow wild Rapes, Milium Solis, Louage, wild Smallage, Hares toongs, wild Thyme, Pistacies, Ra∣dish seed, Tassels, Thistlin séed, and such like, the ashes of Hares heads, of Wagtailes, prepared Bucks bloud, Lapis Spongiae, and Iewes stone: of all these foresaid things may sirupes, Iuleps, confections, powders, pils, salues, baths, and such like be prepared: and because the vnnaturall heate is one of the chiefe occasions of the stone or grauel, therfore are the foresaid cooling things to be vsed, and also all such medicines which in this former chapter and 8. §. be described. To let the growing of the stone. §. 2. NOw for to let that the stone may grow no more, that consisteth in two kinds of causes, viz. that one preuent the tough phlegme from growing which is the cause of the stone, and that the vnnaturall heate get not the masterie.
But in this it chiefly consisteth, that one kéepe a good order of diet, and eschue all that may cause that grosse matter, as milke, and all that is drest with it, fresh Chéese, Cow béefe, Swines flesh, Goates flesh, Géese, and all water fowles, all grosse fish, & all other that be without skales, all that is not well baked, sandie, or is ground with a new sharped stone, Rice, Pease, Beanes, Coleworts, sower fruites, vnripe apples and peares, Citrons, &c. and hard sod egs be also very hurtfull, troubled water, red thicke wine, Must and Béere are also to be eschued. But to the contrary, all light meates are to be vsed, as light and hard baked bread which is a day or two old, wherein Fennell, Annis, Caruwayes, or Nardus séedes are baked, Hens, pullets, Partridges, Capons, yong mutton, Goats, Turtle doues, Doues, and al wild fowles, but especially Wagtailes are very méete for this sicknesse. He may also eate all riuer fish which haue skales, as they that are prepared with parsley: in like manner also poched egges. For his drinke he shall take faire white wine tempered with a little water, wherein the seed of Smal∣lage and Fennell séed is decocted. Meade may also be vsed in stead of his drinke, and for a me∣dicine. He may also drinke sometimes pease broth, and the broth of Lentils wherewith parsley is decocted; but he is not to eate the pease at all. The kernels of bitter Almonds, of Peach stones, of Prune stones, Pingles, Pistacies, and Raisins is he to eate: in fine, he must eschue all which causeth the matter of the stone to increase, and vse al that cooleth the vnnaturall heate, and expelleth the matter of the stone, for which these things following are fit, and be very good, as Agaricus, Hermodactili, Turbith, wild Saffron séed, rootes of Polipodie, and the smell of the wine Hellebore, and also a little roote thereof stéeped a day and a night in water, and the same water drunke also otherwhiles. Amongst the compounded things there is Benedicta laxatiua or Inda, which cleanse the Kid∣neyes, the Bladder and Vreters of all phlegme. The same doth also Cassie giuen with diureti∣call things, and with beaten Licorice, for the same drieth not onely the grauell, but hindereth & letteth also the growing of the stone, and allayeth the heate; and if so be that one giueth it him with the séede of Agnus castus or Licorice, then doth it help the raines maruellously, and stirreth no other humors then those whereof the stone doth grow. Further, there be other things moe which do cleanse the vreters or conduits of vrine, and open them, as the water of Hyssop, of white water Mints, and of Marierom, of Smallage, of Parsley, of Betonie, of Penniroial, of Milium Solis, and aboue al other the water of Hollihocks. Of Sirupes which be most vsed, are the sirupes of Hyssope, de Calamintha, Acetosus compositus, Oxymel compositum, and al other Oxymels, but especially the Oxymel of Squils: and for example, these compounded things ensuing may be made: Take Oxymel of Squils one ounce, sirupe of Hyssope halfe an ounce, water of Harts toong, and of wild Cucumbers, of each one ounce and a halfe. This drinke is to be taken certaine dayes together, vntill one may euidently sée in the co∣lour of the vrine and in other signes, that the disease apparently frameth it self on the better side, by the which the Phisitions haue their especiall markes and signes. And in case there be such matter present which may cause the stone to grow, then are they prepared through the first recited waters, sirupes, and such like for expulsion; and when now the matter is prepared, then is the patient to be purged, which may be done through this ensu∣ing or such like meanes. Take the confection Benedicta one ounce, or one ounce and a half, or somewhat lesse, according to the importance of the cause, then temper them together with thrée ounces of parsley water. Or prepare this following, which clenseth much the kidneys, and expelleth the matter of the stone maruellously: Take Centorie, péeled with Saffron séed, of each one dragme, prepared A∣garicus, powned Hermodactili, of each foure scruples, Diagridion sixe graines, Annis, Fennell, Li∣corice, the séede of Smallage, and Ginger, of each halfe a scruple, Sugar pennets one ounce: stéepe them all together the space of foure and twentie houres in foure ounces of the water of Maidenhaire, afterwards wring it out and drinke it. Lastly, you are to gouerne your selfe as in all other purgations. This following is also much commended for to preuent the grauell: Take about Saint Iohns tide Millet as it standeth and bloometh, then burne it with herbe and roote, and drinke thereof euening and morning two or thrée ounces with wine, and then fast two houres vpon it, and do so fiue or sixe dayes together: it is said, and also taken for to be certaine, that doing this one shall be cléere and frée from the grauell halfe a yeare.
Against the paine of the Grauell. §. 3. BVt if in this disease there happen great paine with it, through which the Phi∣sitions are much hindered, that they cannot vse due remedies; then do they not∣withstanding aduise first of all, that at the first one is to begin with things which allay the paine, or at the least doe ease it: for which are clisters to be vsed made of these herbes following, as Mallowes, Hollihockes, Béetes, Bearefoot, Pellitorie, and such like with the oile of Violets, with Cassie, with Hiera picra, or the confection Benedicta tempered amongst it. Secondly, when the foresaid paine is a litle swaged, then are these things following to be vsed: Take water Cresses, Mallowes, Hollihocks, Mercury, Parow, Cinkfoile, Peucedunum, the herbe of Mew, and Rue, of each one handfull, Calmus, Barley, of each three ounces, Bran, Linséede, of each a little: let all these séeth together in sufficient water, and take twelue or sixteene ounces, temper amongst it Hiera picra, Benedicta and Lithontribon, of each halfe an ounce, oile of Cammo∣mill and of Rue, of each one ounce: this Clister looseth, expelleth wind, and also the paine. Item, take aftewards of the foresaid herbes, but somewhat more Watercresses, and a few Marigolds, and make a bath thereof, and let the patient in it euen vp to the nauell: you are also to put some stalkes of Rapes vnto it, then will it be the better. Thirdly, take Mallowes, Hollihock roots, Water cresses, Cammomil, Maidenhaire, Linséed, and Fenegrake seed, of each two ounces; let them al seeth in sufficient water, wet a woollen clout or sponge therin, and lay it continually warme vpon ye place of the paine. The sodden herbs are you to powne small and temper with Cammomil oile, and so lay them vpon it. The place of the paine is sometimes also to be annointed with these things following: Take the grease of Hens, of Géese, Hogs grease, fresh butter, oile of Camelina and of Violets, of each halfe an ounce, oile of Cammomils & Waxe, of each two dragmes, then let them melt together by the fire. But this is not continually to be vsed, to the end that the raines be not therby too much weakned & inféebled After this annointing are these plaisters following to be laid vpon it, which do asswage the paine, and will open the conduits of vrine: Take thrée ounces of Wheaten meale, of Fene∣gréeke meale, of Linseed, beaten Cammomils, of each one dragme and a halfe, Salt one ounce, then make it to a plaister with the oile of Camelina, and with the oile of Scorpions, and then lay it warme vpon it. You shall find hereafter many things moe which allay the paine also. Of those things which expell grauell and do breake the stone. §. 4. IF there be any feare had of ye stone or grauel, or that one perceiue it already, then may these things be vsed for it: Take oile of Lillies, of Scorpions, and of Earth∣wormes, of each a like much, annoint the raines very fat with it by the fire, or by warme ouen. And if you cannot get this Scorpion oile, then take onely the o∣her oiles. Item, eate euery morning 6. or 7. bitter Almonds, or Peach kernels, like as is counselled before. There is also much commended the bone of a Hare, which we call the Hares spring, pouned, and the same drunken with fresh broth: when as any bodies raines begin to grieue him, then is the red oile of S. Iohns wort estéemed to be very good for to annoint him therewith. Item take 18. or 20. Peach kernels, one quarter of an ounce of Raisins; eate them together, and drinke a good draught vpon it, of pease broth sod without salt or suet: for this is also much commended, the Cicers or Spanish pease which haue a speciall vertue against the grauell. Item, take Hollihocke rootes two pound; the same being made cleane, powne them and séeth them in two or three quarts of water vntill the half, and then straine this broth through a cloth, whereof you are euery morning to drinke a good pul. Afterwards vse the foresaid potion of Ci∣cers and Peach kernels; and when you haue a pound of this drinke, then mixe amongst it one dragme of beaten Cinnamome, and as much of the Swams which groweth on the wild Rose-branches. You may also séeth Parsley rootes, Sperage rootes, and Fennell rootes with it, and drinke often of it: this is especially commended for them that would withstand the grauell. Item, take the rootes of Pimpernell halfe an ounce, Bistorta, Tormentill, Polipodie rootes, and Annis, of each one quarter of an ounce, Gentian, Fenegréek, Oculi cancrorum, peach kernels,
Louage séed, the séed of Smallage, Pickrels bones, shales of hasell nuts, the séed of Mallowes, and Cammomill, of each one dragme; make a powder therof, and take thereof the waight of one dragme, or one dragme and a halfe euery day. The auncient Phisitions accustome to make this potion following,How to make Williams po∣tion. the which they do call Williams potion: Take one handfull of Alehoofe, young Acorne buds halfe so much, the herbe Mouse-eare a little, water and wine, of each a pint; let them seeth together vntill about the half be sodden away, then straine it through a cloth, and drinke thereof in the euening and morning, each time about thrée spoonefuls, and euery foureséene dayes make a fresh. How the wine of winter Cherries is to be prepared, is amongst others dclared in the eight part: it openeth the conduits of vrine maruellously, expelleth the matter whence the stone and grauell doth grow very vehemently, as well out of the kidneyes vreters, as also of the bladder. And now further to come to a right processe of the Grauell, take at the first fiue ounces of fresh oile of swéete Almonds, and drinke the same warme. Two houres afterwards take a good draught of this potion following, and afterwards as often as you will: Take Mallowes with the herbe and rootes, and Hollihocke leaues, of each one handfull, Licorice one ounce, fresh Butter and cléere Honie, of each two ounces; seeth them together in sufficient water, or in the water of Cresses, and so drinke thereof as is expressed. The next day one is to take this con∣fection following early in the morning: Take fresh Cassie and Benedicta, of each halfe an ounce, Species Iustini one dragme and a halfe; temper them together, and then strew them with Sugar and Licorice. Hauing taken this, then is the partie to take thereupon presently a good draught of the water of Cresses: and through this aduice hath many a one bene released of the grauell. Or take of the confection Benedicta fiue or sixe dragmes, Turpentine washed in water of Mal∣lowes, one quarter of an ounce; temper them al together with thrée ounces of Agrimony water, and then drinke it as warme as you can: it is maruellous good against the stone. Necessitie doth otherwhiles require that these confections following are to be giuen to the patient: Take the confection Benedicta and washt Turpentine, of each thrée dragmes and a half, Iewes stone which is prepared with water wherein Millet is decocted, one dragme; temper them all together with powned Licorice, and then giue it him with Cresses water. Men do also take sometimes for it halfe a dragme of prepared blood of a Bucke also, which is not amisse. Hereafter followeth one other necessary meane or processe:Pils for the stone. and first in case the stone be in the bladder, then are these pils to be prepared which do vehemently breake the stone: Take the fruites of Balsam, Radish seed, and the séed of great Smallage. Some do sake for this the seede of stone Parsley, Opopanacum, Capers rootes, bitter Almonds, Saxifrage, Squinanth, Cipers rootes, Indy Spica, Cassie wood, Harts tongue, wild Rue, Gentian, Hartwort, Asarabacca, Car∣damome, Ammoniacum, Serapinum, Bdellium, long Pepper and Calmus, of each a like much: the Gums are to be molten in sufficient Balsam, temper the rest among them beaten small, and make it into pils: take of them one dragme at once with the foresaid confection of Benedicta and of Turpentine, as is before rehearsed: when he is purged, then take Pellitorie of the wall, Mal∣lowes, of each one handfull and a halfe, Linseed, Fenegréeke séed, and Hollihocke rootes, of each one handfull, fiftéene or sixtéene Sebestes, Licorice, powned Millet, of each halfe an ounce: cut all that is to be cut, and let it boile in fresh broth. Take twelue or fifteene ounces thereof, and temper amongst it one ounce of Benedicta, oile of bitter Almonds thrée ounces, slight sugar one ounce and a halfe, Salt one dragme, and one yolke of an egge; then mixe them together, and set this clister very warme. And if that this purgation (by reason of the vnpleasantnes of the Turpentine) went against his stomacke, then may he vse one of these ensuing: Take fresh Cassie one ounce and a quarter, oile of swéete Almonds foure ounces, temper them together, and drinke it. Or take Electuarium de Sebesten and Cassie, of each halfe an ounce, Electuarium Indum one dragme and a halfe, mixe them all together with Sugar, if you will put therewith one dragme of Iewes stone, and make it to a drinke with Millet water, then doth it expell the better. After this are you to come to the things which do breake the stone easily, & open the passages of vrine. For to atchieue this, then is the body first of all to be purged, and afterwards are these following and elected remedies to be vsed.By what meanes the stone to be broken. To breake the stone is this following very forcible: Take prepared Buckes blood one dragme and a halfe, ashes of Scorpions one scruple, ten graines of good Treacle, burnt and
prepared glasse one dragme, then séeth Radishes, Saxifrages, winter Cherries in water or wine, and take foure ounces of this broth, or as much Beane water, and make the foresaid a potion, and vse it fasting in the morning. In case that for all this the paine remaineth indu∣ring, then take scraped Licorice and Currans, of each one quarter of an ounce, pouned Millet, Maidenhaire, of each halfe an ounce, séeth them together in water of Agrimonie, Pellitorie, or Cammomill water: take of this decoction two ounces and a halfe, Spec. Lithontribi one quarter of an ounce, Philonium Romanum two scruples, good wine two ounces, Sugar one ounce; then temper them all together vnto a potion, and drinke it three houres before meate. Item, take prepared Bucks blood one dragme and a halfe, Oxymel of Squils halfe an ounce, Wine wherin Radishes be decocted, foure ounces, then make a potion of it. Further, it is necessary that the stomack be strengthened, and the hot matter of the kidneyes expelled, for which is méet also the foresayd Clister, if there be put vnto it one ounce of Cassie more. Or vse this following: Take twelue ounces of Linséede oyle, oyle of bitter Almonds sixe ounces, Hens grease foure ounces, or in stead of that, as much fresh Butter, two yolkes of Egs, then mixe them all together, and minister it warme. You may also giue vnto the sicke body oyle of swéete or bitter Almonds, of each three ounces and a halfe or more to drink; for it is found, that the same taken by the mouth hath more asswaged the paine, than the which hath bene vsed in the Clisters. It is in like sort found to be very good, that the place be fomented with these things following where the paine is, and after that annointed: Take Cammomill, Maidenhaire, Linseed and Hollihocke rootes, of each one handfull, séeth them all together in white Wine and water: then make a sponge wet in it, and lay the same wrung out very warme vpon it. For the annointing may many things be vsed, or like as hereafter followeth: Take oyle of Scorpions one ounce, oyle of swéet Almonds and Butter, of each halfe an ounce, muscilage of Linséede, of Fenegréeke, of each fiue dragmes, Saxifrage one dragme, and a little molten Waxe, temper them all together. The last and highest meane for the intollerable paine is, that the Harcotica be vsed, which be things that take away all sence and féeling, thus: Take the first described decoction, and put therein of the confection of Lithontribon two dragmes, Philonium Romanum one dragme, oile of swéete almonds one quarter of an ounce, good white Wine two ounces, mingle them all together, and giue thereof to drinke. Will you then make a Clister of it? then take of the foresaid decoction about two ounces, oyle of swéete Almonds foure ounces, Philonium one dragme, Wine thrée ounces, and then minister it like as is accustomed. These two proceedings in this sicknes, I thought good to described thus at length, that euery one might know how to chuse of the medicines following what is most needfull for him. First, we will describe all such things which are to be eaten, and may be vsed in the bodie, and first of all beginning with the confections: Take sponge stones, Hollihocke séed, Millet, and Medlar stones, of each halfe an ounce, prepared Buckes blood one dragme, Iewes stones, and Gromell seede, of each one scruple, great and small Endiue séede, and Pykes bones (which be vnsodden) of each half a dragme, Sugar as much as of all the rest: but the Sugar decocted with the water of winter Cherries, and then make Tabulats thereof, and take of them euery time halfe an ounce. Or take Pomate stone, Iewes stone, and burnt glasse, of each one dragme and a halfe, pre∣pared Bucks blood thrée dragmes, Gromel seed half an ounce, beate them all smal together, Su∣gar as much as all the rest doth weigh, make with the water of winter Cherries, or the water of Mallowes, tabulats of it, and take halfe an ounce at once thereof. Item, take foure ounces of Pistacies, stéepe them two dayes and two nights in the water of winter Cherries, take off the péeles, and chop them very small, Gromell séeds halfe an ounce, rootes of Cinqfoile, Harts toong, wild Thime, Rue séed, of each one dragme and a halfe, Sugar sixe ounces; then seeth it with the water of Saxifrage, make Tabulats of it, and vse them as before. Another. Take prepared Buckes blood one dragme and a halfe, the iawbones of Pickrels two scruples, Iew stones and Sponge stones, of each halfe a dragme, Melon seed, Hollihocke séed, Licorice, the seed of Smallage, Cucubes, of each one scruple, Sugar two ounces and a halfe, make a confection thereof with the water of Mallowes. Fennell seed and Comin raw or confected and eaten, be good for all diseases in the kidneyes of the stone and grauell. The confection of Iustini or Lithontribon, as they be prepared at all wel furnished Apothecaries, are also maruellous good for this vse.
In like manner also bitter Almonds confected and eaten, expell the matter whence the stone doth grow. This following is also a very sumptuous Confection: Take burnt glasse, and burnt Gras∣hoppers, whereof the féete and wings be cast away, of each thrée dragmes, the ashes of a burnt Hare, and preared Buckes blood, of each one ounce, Plantain seed, Starch, the seed of Butchers broome, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Sirupi Acetosi Compositi thirtie ounces, Sugar pennets 24. ounces, then make an electuarie thereof. This foresaid confection doth clense all slimie mat∣ter and grauell, it breaketh the stone, and openeth all conduits of vrine if one take euery mor∣ning the space of foureteene dayes three dragmes, with the water of Gromell, or Radish water. The Confection of a calcined Hare is thus to be prepared:The electu∣arie of a calcined Hare. Take Iewes stone and Sponge stones, of each one dragme, the powder of a burnt Hare one quarter of an ounce, Spec. Lithontri∣bon one quarter of an ounce, Sugar foure ounces: make thereof with Saxifrage water tabulats or a Confection. This foresaid Electuary prouoketh vrine, and clenseth all the vreters of all slime and grauel, and expelleth also all windes: take thereof two or three dragmes with the wa∣ter of Sperage betimes in the morning, and also before both the meale tides. Item, take yellow wild Rape seed, Comin, Balsam wood, Parsley seed, sweet Costus rootes, Calmus, Annis, Asarabacca, Fennel and Cinnamom, of each one dragme, the seed of Purslaine, of Endiue, of small Endiue, of Lettice and Cretae Marinae, of each one drag. Lapis Lyncis, Sponge stones, and burnt Glasse, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar as much as is needfull for to make a Confection. One may take a dragme or two thereof with a little water; all according to the importance of the cause. The Confection of horse Radishes is thus to be prepared: Take well clensed horse Radishes,The cōfectiō or electuarie of horse Ra∣dishes. cut them in round slices, and let them stand a steepe in Vineger vntill that they be very soft; Or poure strong wine vpon it, and renew the same euery day, and that the space of fiue or sixe dayes; at length seeth them away therewith, and rubbe them through a strainer: Afterwards, take thereof one pound, and one pound and a half of clarified honie, then let them seeth together by a gentle fire, stirring them alwayes about vntill they be decocted, as behooueth for a confecti∣on. Afterwards let it be somewhat cold, and put the spices vnto it, which hereafter in the eight part in the first chapter of Calmus are described. Or take in the stead of the same halfe an ounce of Cinnamom, Ginger three quarters of an ounce, Cardamome, Cucubes, Cloues and Nut∣megs, of each one drag. and a halfe; temper them together: therewithall the fuming of the horse Radishes in the head is abated and taken away. This confection is not onely good for the stone and grauell, but also for the stomacke; it warmeth the inward parts, and delayeth the paine in the belly which proceedeth of cold; it is a right Treacle for the common people, and an especiall medicine for the Scuruie. There is also another confection prepared for this (called Electuarium de Cineribus,The confec∣tion of ashes. which is a confection of ashes, as followeth hereafter:) Take ashes of burnt Scorpions one quarter of an ounce, Cantarides without heads and wings one dragme, prepared Buckes blood one quarter of an ounce, burnt glasse, ashes of vnset Coleworts, Hares ashes, ashes of Wagtayles, and ashes of egshels whereof Chickens haue bene hatched, or each two dragmes, Iew stones, stones of Oxe galles, Pepper, wild yellow Rape seede, Caraway, Hollihocke seede, Gum, Saxifrage and Gromell seedes, Seseli, Balsam fruites and the wood, India Spica, Maidenhaire, Mallowes, Pompeons, Cucumbers, and Gourd seedes, of each one dragme, of Roses as much as sufficeth for to make a confection of it, take thereof morning and euening the quantitie of a hasell nut at once, tempered with the decoction of Cicers. Item, take Mithridate or new Treacle, halfe or a whole dragme, with the decoction of Ci∣cers: they expell and breake the grauell and the stone, and also ease the paine, especially if it be vsed after bathing. Amongst all other confected things, are especiall good for the stone and grauell (chiefly if one want warmth) the preserued Elecampane rootes, Pimpernell rootes, Calmus, yellow Rapes, Parsneps, conserue of Gilloflowers, and of Pionie: the water Cresses eaten for a sallad, ex∣pelleth the stone, the grauell and vrine. There be diuers powders made for this which follow hereafter: Take prepared Buckes blood halfe an ounce, Lapis Lyncis, Lapis cacrorum, and peach kernels, of each one dragme, the
seed of Parsley and Smallage, of each halfe an ounce, beate them all together, and temper them all together, vse thereof in the morning, at noone, and in the euening halfe a dragme, or more at once, with that kind of Beane water which immediatly is described hereunderneath, and that so long, vntill the stone auoid, and that you perceiue no more grauell. Item, take Saxifrage, Annis, Pepper, the seed of Smallage, Gromell séed, and Sperage séede, of each a like much, beate them all together very small, and let them passe through a scarse, then take thereof halfe a dragme or a whole dragme with honywater or with wine. This following hath oftentimes bene approoued: Take parched Peach kernels halfe an ounce, Medlar stones one ounce, powne them very small, and then giue him a dragme thereof with the water of Saxifrage wherein Cinqfoile hath bene decocted. There is also one ounce, or one ounce and a halfe of Oximel to be put thereto, and to temper the same with any water; that also expelleth the stone: but one must beware therein for vsing any hote things. This drinke is also very requisite for this: Take wild Thistle rootes, which be the rootes of Tassel, and rootes of Smallage, of each one handfull, Annis halfe a dragme: seeth them all toge∣ther in a quart and a halfe of water vnto the halfe. Item, take Sponge stones, Iewes stones, burnt glasse, prepared Buckes blood and Sugar, of each a like quantitie, giue one dragme thereof with Oxymel or with the water of Smallage when he hath the paine. Both these foresaid are by reason of the great help and cure that they do, called the hand of God. Item, take the rootes of Burres one dragme and a halfe, burnt glasse one dragme, rubbe the same with vineger, with the water of Smallage, or with any other such like distilled waters: this is maruellously praised of all auncient Phisitions. Another. Take Gromell seed one dragme, Licorice one quarter of an ounce, péeled Melon séed halfe an ounce, gum of the Cherrie tree one ounce: powne them all to powder, and giue thereof at each time halfe an ounce with a little distilled water. Or take Gromell seed, Annis, Fennell, Parsley seeds, and péeled Melon seed, of each one dragme, Lignum Aloes, winter Cherries, red Saxifrage, Sponge stones and Iewes stones, of each one scruple, the seed of Broome and of Saxifrage, of each halfe a dragme, Cinnamom, pre∣pared Coriander, and red Saunders, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Cloues, Galingal, Gin∣ger, of each thrée dragmes, white Sugar two ounces, make a powder of it, and take one dragme at once thereof with Mallowes water and pease broth. Another. Take Gromel seed, and the seed of Saxifrage, of each one dragme, the séeds of Lettice, of Henbane, of Pompeons, of white Poppies, of Melons, of Cucumbers, of Gourds (all toge∣ther péeled) of each two scruples, powned Licorice foure scruples, Trocisci Alkakengi which is of winter Cherries one dragme and a halfe, the seed of Pimpernell, of Broome, of each two scru∣ples, Sugar two ounces, make a powder of them. In like manner, there be good for this disease powned Medlar stones, and powdred Earth∣wormes, of each one dragme and a halfe well weyed, and take Fenelike with Saxifrage water. Item, séeth a Crabbe like as they be vsed to be sod, and wash the same with Wine, and let it drie, then beate it cleane to powder with his shels, and take one quarter of an ounce thereof with wine. Or take the powder of Maidenhaire one quarter of an ounce, and drinke it with the water of Strawberries or the water of Mallowes, or the water of Parsley, it is also especiall good. Take halfe an ounce of the shales of hasell nuts beaten small, Sugar also as much, temper them together, and vse thereof euery time a dragme or more fasting in the morning with the water of Lillies; and women may drinke it with wine or any thing else in stead of Lilly water. The stone which is cut out of one, beaten small, and halfe a dragme thereof taken euery day with the water of Saxifrage or Radish water, doth also breake the stone of the bladder. Item, take Licorice one quarter of an ounce, Sponge stone, and Iewes stone, of each ten graines, Fennell seed, Ameos Mirrha, Annys, the seed of Mallowes, péeled Melon seed, Pom∣peon séede, chopt small together, of each halfe a dragme, Cinnamome one dragme beaten small together: there is the waight of a dragme thereof to be taken with any of the foresaid waters. There may also be prepared for this these pilles ensuing: Take burnt glasse, ashes of a Hare, Sponge stone, and Iewes stone, of each a like much, make pils thereof with the water of Saxi∣frage:
also thrée round slices of Radishes eaten euery morning be very good. In like sort also the small bird the Wagtaile rosted, powdered, or taken as one will, is maruellous good for this, like as here before is specified already. It is also taken for a certaine experiment if one do accustome to eate Nettles, that thereby he should be freed of the stone and grauell. Now we will write of certaine potions which be méete for the stone and the grauell:Potions for the stone. Take Turpentine which is washed with Mallowes water, thrée quarters of an ounce, Species Iustini two scruples, Benedicta Laxatiua halfe a dragme; let the Turpentine and decoction melt, after∣wards temper the rest with it, and so drinke it as warme as you can. Another. Take Rubarbe one quarter of an ounce, Iuniper berries one ounce, the barke of the Cassie thrée dragmes, Iewes stone halfe an ounce, Agaricus, Ginger, Cinnamome, Galm∣gall and Masticke, of each one dragme, Mithridate thrée dragmes, Mace, Cloues, of each halfe a dragme, spirit of Wine one pint, and Malmsey three pints: set them all together the space of three moneths in the sunne there to distil; and of this distillation giue two ounces early in the morning, or being in the bath, it is a maruellous and approoued remedy. Another. Take Rubarbe, Gnger berries, Cassie wood, and Fennell, of each one quarter of an ounce, Annis one dragme, Licorice fiue dragmes, Iewes stone halfe an ounce, Agaricus, Ginger, Cinnamome and Cloues, of each one dragme, Mithridate thrée dragmes, Mace and Nutmegs, of each halfe a dragme, Mastick one dragme; put all these together beaten in a glasse, and poure thereon thrée pound of the spirit of Wine or Aqua vitae, then stop it tight, and set it the space of fiue dayes in the sunne; stirre it all together very well, then poure as much Malmsey vnto it, and let it stand againe eight or foureteene dayes in the sunne, stirring it euery day well about, afterwards straine it and kéepe it well; when as the grauell beginneth to pricke, then take a spoonefull thereof euery day, and you shall find amendment out of hand. This same may be distilled like as the former. Another. Take a pint of Aqua vitae more or lesse as you will, Malmsey foure ounces, Sugar-candy eight ounces, the water of Strawberries foure ounces, Parsley water two ounces; mixe them together, and take a spoonefull thereof, or as much as you please. It is also here to be marked that you need not be afraid of Aqua vitae, burnt Wine, or any o∣ther strong wine: for all learned do require to drinke strong wine, as Vinum punicum, Malmesey, Muscadell, and such like, against the grauel or the stone, yea when the paine is at the extremest, yet with moderation. Some that loue distillations do very much commend this potion following against the gra∣uell: Take oyle of Mace and cléere Turpentine, of each ten or twelue drops, Annis water and Fennell water, of each one quarter of an ounce, the sirupe of Licorice one ounce, oile of Vitrioll thrée or foure drops, then temper them well together, afterwards proue it; and if so be that it be not so sower that it set the téeth on edge, then it is méetly; and if it be not sower enough, then put two drops of the oile of Vitrioll more into it. It is somewhat perillous to deale with the oile of Vitriol, therfore good héed is to be had and taken, like as is declared in his description. Take Nettle seed two ounces and a halfe, poure wine vpon it, and drinke thereof. This wine is accounted maruellous good for the grauell and for the stone. Here before is oftentimes admonshed of Beane water, which is thus made:The water of Beanes. when they be∣gin to be ripe, or when they be in their full iuice, then is onely the outtermost gréene pods or péeles to be taken where the Beanes do lie, and the leaues, and all their moisture is to be distil∣led out of them in séething water. This being done, then take one ounce and a halfe thereof, prepared Bucks blood one dragme or foure scruples, and giue the patient therof in the morning when he riseth, and at night when he goeth to bed. And this is he to obserue and continue so long vntill that the stone or grauell be cleane expelled, and no more grauell can be perceiued: this is of all auncient and latter Phisitions taken to be a famous and certaine experiment. Item, take womans milke about two ounces, stéepe therein cut sprigs of Cipers, and let them stand and stéepe the space of thrée or foure houres in a warme place, and then drinke it. Item, take Knotgrasse halfe an ounce, red Pease, and peeled Melon séede, of each one ounce, let them séeth in twelue ounces of water euen vnto the halfe, and giue thereof one ounce at once tempered with a little Sugar: the meade or honywater is an especiall medicine against the grauell and the stone. In like manner also wine or water wherein Harts toong and Mal∣lowes
be decocted, and also of both these distilled waters. Item, take a good handfull of Watercresses, séeth them in a pint of water vnto the halfe, and drinke thereof morning and euening, each time thrée or foure ounces, and do this the space of eight or ten dayes together. Some do also much commend Limons water. Take the rootes of Cheruill and Saxifrage, of each a like quantitie: séeth them in wine, and drinke oftentimes thereof, it breaketh the stone, and causeth well to make water. Or take Mai∣denhaire one handfull, winter Cherries and Gromell séed, of each two dragmes, boile them in a pint of white wine vntil two thirds remaine, take three or foure ounces at once, and especially after a bath the water of Larkes spurre. Likewise also the water of Carduus Benedictus, if one do drinke thrée or foure ounces of it, is very good for the stone. Item, so are all these waters insuing good therefore, viz. the water of Sa∣xifrage, of Pellitorie, of Cinqfoile, of Watercresses, of Fennell, of Radishes, of Maidenhaire, of Strawberries and of Cammomill. Item, take a fresh Radish, cut it to thinne round slices, and poure thereon Vinum punicum, or any other good wine: afterwards drinke thereof sometimes a good draught. You haue also herebefore in the twelfth chapter and eleuenth §. a good drinke against the gra∣uell and the stone, beginning, Take Gentian, &c. Item, take Maidenhaire, Sperage, Tassell leaues, water Mints, broade plantaine, and red pease, of each a like quantitie; seeth them all together in water, then take of this decoction fiue ounces, and temper therewith two ounces of Oxymel; afterwards giue it to the patient. Fur∣ther, lay him a bed and let him sweate wel: this openeth the conduits of vrine, maketh altough humors thinne, and expelleth them which cause the stone and the grauell. Further, there be diuers wines decocted and also vnsodden, whereof we will discouer some. Of all the most vsed are these following, as the wine of winter Cherries, wine of Elecampane rootes, wine of Hyssop, wine of Harts toong, and wine of Assarabacca, which is thus to be prepa∣red:Vrine of As∣sarabacca. Take Must, and to euery quart of Must halfe an ounce of Assarabacca, the herbe being taken off when the roote hath bene a drying the space of two moneths. Of this wine take euery eue∣ning and euery morning a good draught: it forceth the vrine and the grauell, it warmeth all in∣ward parts, it expelleth the Ague, it is good for the Dropsie, and also for the yellow Iaundies. Another good Wine. TAke Strawberrie leaues, Pellitorie, Water cresses, and Gourd cresses, of each a like quantitie: séeth them in Wine vntill the third part be consumed, then drinke thereof a meetly draught when you go to bed, and in the morning when you rise. This hath bene oftentimes found very good. All Phisitions do conclude, that all troubled and thicke Wine, much and often drunken, causeth the stone and the grauell speedily to grow. Therefore must one alwayes beware thereof. The Cherrie wine, like as it by reason of the temperate nature may be vsed in all sicknesses; so may the same also be occupied for this disease, and especially when the Cherries with their kernels be stamped in péeces, whereof it is made, then doth it driue out the grauell the better. We will here yet describe certaine sirupes which may be vsed with great commoditie for the grauell, like as these ensuing: Take the roots of Sperage, of Ruscus, and of grasse, of each thrée ounces, Harts toong with the rootes, Creta marina, Maidenhaire, water mints, Saxifrage, Pim∣pernell, and Yarrow, of each one handfull, red pease two ounces, Vineger of Squils one ounce, white Sugar and honie, of each sixe ounces. Lastly, seeth a cleare sirupe of this, and vse the same with diureticall waters. Another. TAke Fennell rootes, parsley rootes, the rootes of Smallage and of Sperage, of each one handfull, the séedes of parsley, of fennell, of Smallage, of Annise, of Caruway, of Lettice, of purslaine, of small Endiue, of Melons, of pompeons, of Gourds, and of Cucumbers, of each one ounce, red and white Saunders, Roses and Violets, of each halfe a dragme, fiue and
twentie or thirtie dry prunes, Harts toong, Liuerwort, Centorie, and Maidenhaire, of each two handfuls. All these foresaid things séeth in sufficient water vnto the halfe and then wring them out, vnto this decoction put eightéene ounces of Sugar, and let it seeth againe to a sirupe, and then clarifie it with the white of an egge. What outwardly ought to be vsed. FOr the grauell and the stone may diuers things be also outwardly vsed, whereof we shall hereafter write and discourse sufficiently, but we will first begin with the salue. Take the fat of the kidneyes of a Weather, stampe it very small, and temper therewith a crusefull of the iuice of water Cresses, or garden Cresses, and let them seeth together: this be∣ing done, then straine it through a cloth, and annoint you therewith. In like maner is also good for all grauel and paine of the raines, for the stone and the conduits of vrine, and for all diseases of the bladder, the precious blame or oile, which, in the last part of this booke, is the first of all the rest that is described, if one be annointed therewith. For a plaister is this following to be vsed: Take Hollihocke rootes with the séed, Linseed, figs, and butter, of each an ounce, oile of swéete Almonds two ounces, Waxe as much as is needfull for to make a plaister, and then lay it vpon the kidneyes; afterwards you are also to annoint the place of the raines with the oile of Scorpions, and to spout some of that oile therein. Item, take oile of Scorpions thrée ounces, burnt sponge stones, and burnt Wagtailes, of each 3. dragmes, Iewes stone one dragme, make a salue or a plaister thereof with waxe. Item, in the former sixtéenth chapter and the fift §. is described a plaister of Radishes, which may also be vsed for this purpose. For this is also good a pap made of the crums of white bread decocted with wine, and a little Saffron put to it. Item for to lay vpon it: Take Pellitorie, put some Scorpion oile vnto it, oile of Cammomil and some oile of Camelina; frie them all together in a pan vntill it be as thick as pap, afterwards put amongst it powned Saffron, and then lay it vpon the kidneyes. Item, take Pellitorie, Spikenard, Spica Romana, Fennell seed, parsley séed, wild yellow Rape séed, and Assarabacca, of each one handfull, powne them somewhat together, and put it in a bag, afterwards let it séeth in wine and lay it ouer the raines. Of bathing and fomenting in the grauell. AL they that can come to the warme sulphure bathes, may franke and fréely vse them, for these be very necessary for to breake the stone. But if so be that one cannot come at them, then let this following be prepared: Take Hollihocke leaues, Fennell, parsley with the rootes, Pellitorie and Linseed, of each one handful; put them together in a bag and séeth them in a great kettle of water, afterwards let it be meetly cold without putting any other water vnto it: then set the patient in it euen to the nauell, as long as he can abide. This is to be often vsed, and so long vntill that the patient do find that the stone weareth away. Another, take Pellitorie, Lauender flowers, parsley seed, Fennell séed, wild yellow Rape séed; seeth them all together (as is aforesaid) and bathe therewith. The bag is also to be laid vpon the kidneyes. Item, take the herbe Horsetaile, Mallowes, wild Thyme, the stalkes of Rapes, put them all together in a bagge, and séeth them in a great kettle with water; and further, let it be meetly cold of it selfe, and vsed as before. When one hath then bathed a certaine space, then are diureticall potions and salues of the raines to be vsed, made of such things as are described herebefore. These are now the principallest things which of the ancient and latter Phisitions are descri∣bed against the grauell and the stone of the bladder: also whatsoeuer else is prescribed for the in∣firmities of the kidneyes, that is for this most meete and conuenient. There be also moe accidents which are wont next to the grauell and the stone to accord and accompanie it, as Lithiasis, Dysuria, Stranguria and Ischuria, and all these bring also great paine and sometimes swellings, whereby the conduits of vrine be stopt: but because that these altoge∣ther
belong but to the bladder and the necke of the same, therefore will we discourse thereof af∣ter the description of the Bladder. But there is yet a heauie disease which procéedeth from the kidneyes, the which we are here to describe, and therewith to conclude this Chapter. When any one cannot hold his water. §. 5. THis disease the Grecians call Diabeten, the Latinists Vrinae profluuium, which is an vnnatural fluxe of the vrine: with the great paine which is with this disease there is an excessiue and intolerable thirst, the which when one thinketh to quench with drinking, then doth all that is drunke passe straight away from him, and is with∣out any alteration of the same drinke pist out againe altogether, whereby this disease hath his name also Profluuium. Well now, this is a disease of the kidneyes, which is wholy to be compared with the disease of the stomack in the fluxe Lienteria: in which disease of the stomack or fluxe, there is no satiable∣nes of meate because that the meate receiued, forthwith vndigested and without any alteration passeth out through the bowels. And albeit (as is said) this vnnaturall heate of the Raines commeth from the Liuer, the which afterwards doth draw vnto it the moisture which is receiued of the stomacke, then doth this disease neuerthelesse for all that come from the cold of the kidneyes and of the whole body, like as may be seene in them who get the palsie, & cannot hold their vrine. If it procéed of heate, then it is knowne by the paine and pricking about the kidneyes, and by the great thirst. If of cold, that is to be perceiued about the same parts, and in the outward members, for cold things offend him, and all warme things are acceptable. By all these forementioned things are yet the tokens that in pissing there is no paine, and that there is stopping of the stale: when this sicknesse growes to be old, whether it be in aged or yong persons, then is it estéemed to be incurable, for that it consumeth the body from day to day, and that so long, vntill that death follow after it. The cure of these sicknesses depend on these rules ensuing, whereof the first is, like as this disease is caused most out of heate and drieth of the kidneyes, so is the same to be remedied though cooling and moist things: secondly, if so be that the retentiue force of the kidneyes be in∣feebled through the superfluous moisture which they do draw vnto them, then are men to strengthen the same (if it be caused through heate) with astringent & cooling things, and to alter their nature: thirdly, because that the whole body through the attraction and affluence of all waterish moisture, waxeth faint and thirstie; therefore it is good not to permit the sicke person to drinke much, that he fall not vtterly thereby into the consuming ague Marasmum: fourthly, if so be that the sicknesse be caused through heate, and that the liuer and the stomacke be also thereby infected, then is he to eschue all light meates and egs: fiftly, to the end the moisture may be drawne to another place, then is after much drinking of water parbraking and vomiting to be prouoked: sixtly, all that draweth the moisture outward, as the sweat, is here very profitable: seuenthly, like as the body in this sicknes is commonly bound and obstructed, therefore is care to be had to open the same with Clisters. And like as we haue expressed that this disease Diabetes can be caused through heate and cold, therefore will wée write distinctly and seuerally thereof, and first beginne with the cold Diabetes. Of the effluxion of the vrine through cold. §. 6. THough now it happeneth (like as we haue discoursed here before) that the sicke persons do make water very much, and yet no heate perceiued thereby, or that a nights his vrine vnwitting runne from him, and had also no thirst and abated not, then are all such medicines to be giuen him which do stay the vrine: for which these things following shall be very méete: To wit, egges supt early in the mor∣ning fasting, steeled milke, or wherein peeble stones be slacked; but especiall is the shéepes milke commended for it.
Some do aduise that for this disease is euery day to be taken halfe a dragme or a dragme of Mithridate with a good draught of wine. These pils following are also highly commended for this disease: Take Beuercod, Myrrhe, Hissope, Marierom, Acorne cups, and Pieratrion, of each a like quantitie, make them to powder; then take the sirupe of Mirtles, and forme a masse of pils thereof; afterwards then giue a dragme thereof at once, to wit, when the patient goeth to bed. Or vse this powder following: Take Acorne cups, powne them to powder, and take thereof one quarter of an ounce at once with red Wine before that you go to bed. Item, take a burnt Hedge-hog powdered one dragme, or one dragme and a halfe, and giue it him as before; the flesh of an Hedge-hog is maruellous good for this. Item, take Acornes one dragme, Fran∣kinsence thrée ounces, and sixe dragmes of prepared Coriander, fine Bolus and Gum, of each one ounce and a quarter, then make a powder of it, and take euery morning thereof one ounce and a halfe with red wine. Item, take powned Agrimony one dragme with red wine when you go to bed. Outwardly may some of these things following be vsed: Take oile of Lillies, or oile of Co∣stus, annoint the priuities with it and the parts about it: but temper amongst it some fine Bo∣lus, Masticke, Momie, Myrrhe, and make a salue of it. Or lay one of these plaisters following vpon it: Take Laudanum and Masticke, of each one ounce, Frankinsence, Cipers nuts, of each one dragme, Lignum Aloes, red Stirax, Calmus, Galingall, Cinnamom, of each halfe a dragme, Turpentine one dragme, or as much as is néedfull, melt the Laudanum in a warme mortar, then make a plaister thereof, and lay it ouer the priuities; but first shaue off the haire, that the plaister may be taken off without paine. Or make this following: Take Laudanum and Mastick, of each two dragmes, Lignum Aloes, red Storax, Galingal and Quince kernels, of each one dragme, Turpentine one ounce; powne all that is to be powned, and adde the Laudanum vnto it as before, spread it on leather and apply it to the priuities. Another. Take the iuice of Mints twelue ounces, Frankinsence and Masticke, of each halfe an ounce, Cipers nuts one quarter of an ounce, Galingall, Lignum Aloes, of each one dragme, Cinnamome, or beaten Comin séede as much as is néedfull for a plaister, vse it as is before shewed. It is to be noted that the Comin séede must be parched before. What further is requisite for this purpose, it may be sought for in the third part, the 11. Chapter, and also in the 12. chapter, in the first part, and 13. §. For the affluxion of vrine through heate. §. 7. IF so be that there be with this vnnaturall affluxion of the vrine an vnnaturall thirst, and the drinke forthwith pist out againe, then are these meanes following to be vsed: first, in case that the body be bounden, then minister to the patient laxatiue clisters of the common cooling herbes, wherewith Hiera picra or Bene∣dicta with the oyle of Violets be tempered; and immediatly afterwards open the liuer veine, whereby all the ill accidents of the body may be defended and auoyded. And if it be néedful, purge the patient with yellow Mirobalans and with Cassie, which both do coole. But if you will make it that it be good for the grauell, then mixe things amongst it which expell the grauell: afterwards cause the patient to vomit when he hath drunken much water, like as is taught in the sixt rule. Otherwise is this ensuing especially commended for this disease Diabetes: Take Acacia one quarter of an ounce, Rose leaues thrée dragmes, fine Bolus, Gum, and Dragagant, of each half an ounce; powne them all small together, and let it passe through a small sieue: afterwards make it into small Trocisces, with the muscilage of Fleawort, and giue thereof the waight of a dragme with Endiue water, Burrage and Cicorie water. Item, take fine Bolus and Sealed earth, of each one scruple, the iuice of Sloes, Pomgranate flowers, Mirtle séede, red Corall, and Roses, of each one dragme; make a fine powder thereof, when he goeth to rest, with thick red wine: or take the innermost rinds of hens mawes, wash them cleane with wine, and dry them, the powder of a burnt Hares head and Mastick, of each half an ounce, Agrimony fiue dragmes, burnt powder of an Hedge-hog halfe an ounce, temper them all together, and powne them all
small to powder; afterwards giue thereof one dragme and a halfe with red Wine when he go∣eth to sléepe. Another. Take Nettle rootes one handfull, Veruaine and Caruway, of each one handfull and a halfe, séeth them together in steeled water, and drinke thereof. Item, take Sorba and peares, stampe them together, distill a water thereof, and drinke often of it, or mingle any other drinke amongst it. Outwardly may these things following be vsed: stampe cooling herbes, viz. Lettice, Pur∣slaine, Nightshade, Housléeke, Rose leaues, and Willow leaues. Or cut fresh Pompeons or Citrons in broade peeces and lay them thereon: you may also weare a beaten plate of led vpon the raines, the which may be made oftentimes wet with Vineger. Also prepare this salue ensuing: Take thrée ounces of Poplar salue, oile of Roses, and oile of Mandagora, of each halfe an ounce, the muscilage of Fleawort one quarter of an ounce, Vineger one dragme, Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make therewith a salue. Item, take the iuice of Lettice, of Purslaine and of Nightshade, of each one dragme and a halfe, Rose water one ounce, Vineger halfe an ounce, white beaten Poppie séede one ounce, Waxe as much as sufficeth for a salue, and annoint the raines with it. After the annointing lay then this plaister following vpon it: Take Barly meale, Vineger, and oile of Roses, let them séeth together, and lay it thereon. Or take Vine leaues, Willow leaues, Quince leaues, Tassell leaues, and Housleeke, of each one handfull, stampe them well together, and put vnto it sixe ounces of Barley meale, oile of Roses and Vineger, as much as sufficeth for to make a plaister, then lay it cold vpon it. The order of diet. ALl meates that do coole are good for this patient, as Veriuice, the iuice of Ruscus, Barley, and all that is drest with Barly, Almond milke, and Rice, all fruits which coole and bind, as Medlars, Sorba, Sloes, Cherries, sometimes also plums, Mulberies, Pomegranates, and Strawberries are also good for him. If there be neither heate nor Ague with it, then may he haue the foresaid things drest, as Barly, Rice and Almonds with fresh broth. He may also vse otherwhiles Neates feete and riuer fish, but very little salted. Also hen-broth decocted with coo∣ling séedes is very good for him. His best drink shall be Barly water, wherein a little Fleawort is decocted. Buttermilke is also good for him. The iuice of the first mentioned fruites may be mixed with fresh Well water, and so drunke: in like sort also the Rose water of it selfe alone. Thicke red wine is also (as before) to be tempered with fresh well water. For this is also méete the sirupe of Violets, or Iulep of Violets, with some cooling waters, or tempered with some well water. You haue also herebefore in the twelfth chapter and 3. §. other Iuleps and Confections moe which be also very fit for this vse, as Triasantalon and Diarrhodon Abbatis, therefore is he to take now the one and then the other, to the end that nature chance not to abhorre and loath that which is to be taken. For an intolerable thirst may this following be vsed: Take burnt Iuorie ten dragmes, Lettice séed and Purslaine séede, of each fifteene dragmes, Coriander séede, yellow Rose séedes, and fine Bolus, of each fiue dragmes, Pomegranate blossomes one quarter of an ounce, Camfer halfe a dragme; then make a powder of it, and vse one dragme thereof, or one dragme and a half at once with the iuice of pomegranates. What is further good for the thirst, looke for it in the twelfth Chapter and 10. §. in the third part of this booke. This patient must restraine and kéepe himselfe from all labour, and conuersation or compa∣nie of women. Also to eschue all sower things, and to performe and do in all things like as herebefore in the sixt Chapter and 1. §. is taught of the eftluxion of humane séede.
The eighteenth Chapter. Of the Bladder. THis inward part the Bladder is common to all humane bodies; it is made of two strong skins or membranes, whereof the innermost skinne is twise as strong as the outmost, and that not in vaine, but to the end it might the better withstand the sharpnes of the vrine. Both these skinnes are formed of a slipperie white matter: and betwéene both the skinnes or membranes there runne many veines, sinewes and arteries euery way, whereby they do draw the moisture of the Vreters, which do come from the Raines, and do carrie it into the Bladder. For the foresaid Vreters be so small and so narrow, that one cannot in a dead bodie discerne nor find the same; like as also the bladder of beasts doth manifest the same, which is so tight and so shut vp, that no water nor wind can pierce through. In men doth this Bladder lye with his necke (which is fleshie) very hard besides the Arse∣gt, crooked, and almost like this letter S, great and long euen to the beginning of the Yard. But in women the necke of the bladder doth lie somewhat higher then the necke of the wombe, it is also shorter and wider, and therefore also they may much easier be holpen of the stone then men. Item, in the forepart of the necke of the bladder there is a muskellish flesh, the which hol∣deth the vrine so long shut vp, vntill a bodie desire to make or let go his water. Further, mens bladders be also according to the proportion of the bodie, much bigger than in any beasts: they can also stretch themselues very farre, whereby they in time of néede may retaine and kéepe a great quantitie of vrine. Whensoeuer this bladder also is pricked in her membrane substance, or a hole made in it, then is it incurable; notwithstanding that Aristotle doth thinke that it hath bene healed, but very seldome: for the necke of the bladder, which we haue said to be fleshie, may be healed with∣out plaister or salue, and onely through the vrine, like as is sufficiently made knowne & shewed by the stone cutters. Amongst beasts, they only haue bladders which bring forth a liuing creature into the world, and that haue lights full of blood. But all that do lay egs, as fowles and wormes, they haue al∣together no bladder, the Tortoise onely excepted. This bladder is by nature ordained for a receiuer of the vrine, and to the bodie a very néedful member; for if so be that nature must haue expelled all her waterish moisture throughout al the whole bodie, not hauing any particular vent or passage for it, then of necessitie should a bodie oftentimes either drie away or stifle. To this bladder do also happen oftentimes many sundrie diseases and perillous infections, as the grauell, the stone, painfull making of vrine, retention of the same, the Strangurie, slime, obstruction through blood, the which doth not onely cause heate, swelling vlcers, and deadly im∣postumes, but also bringeth with it many kinds of other perils: and because that we herebefore haue written at large thereof, therefore will we not here rehearse them againe, but only speake and discourse of those things that concerne the bladder and the necke of the same. Of retention of vrine in generall. §. 1. VNder the name of the retention of vrine wée do comprehend all accidents, whereby the water is retained and kept backe, whereof there be fiue kinds disclosed in the seuentéenth chapter, in the conclusion of the fourth §. and here are to be rehearsed. Amongst all these is the one more violent then the other, and for that cause are to be cured and holpen with diuers and sundry remedies. First, we will speake of the disease which the Grecians do call Lithiasm, which is when the stone of the bladder relying on the neck of the same, hindereth the passage of vrine, or causeth such a distention of the yard and foreskin, that this and the stone together doth wholy hinder and kéepe backe the vrine, which is not without great paine and trouble to the
patient: but these meanes following are to be vsed in this extremitie. If so be that the stone of the bladder cannot be expelled through the former remedies, then put backe the stone and so let out the vrine. First, the patient is to be layd on high with his arse, and spread his legs abroade, and shake and rub the place strongly, that thereby the stone may be remoued from the necke of the bladder, or the same is to be put backe with a siluer instrument, that thereby the vrine might fréely passe forth. But great care is to be had whether the passage for the vrine be not shut vp by some swelling, otherwise would the yard within thereby be bru∣sed, and the griefe made worse then before. The second maner of the retention of vrine is Dysuria, which is when a man doth make wa∣ter with great griefe and paine very slowly, the which is commonly perceiued by the pricking paine and great heate in the forepart of the yard. The third kind of the retention of vrine is called Stranguria, which is when one is constrained to make water often, and that with a few drops at once. These two sorts of retention of vrine, are so like one to the other, that few Phisitions can seuer them, yet neuertheles haue they some differences. Both these kinds are caused of a sharpnesse of some humour and of the vrine: or through the debilitie of the muscles and of the retentiue power. For if there come any sharpe or corro∣ding humour into the bladder, then will it presently by force expell the same without any inter∣mission. Or if the retentiue vertue of the bladder be weakned, then can it not abide the least dissension in the world, but let the vrine continually passe forth as an intolerable burthen. Ischuria detaineth the vrine altogether, and is caused diuersly, to wit, of heate, of the hardnes of the passage, of the debility of the expulsiue and force of the retentiue vertue, and of the fore∣mentioned disease Lithiasis. Also if there be any grosse and tough slime gathered together in the passage of the vrine, or if there be any clotted blood, through blowes or falles setled in the bladder, which there do hinder the course of the vrine. In like maner also when the kidneyes and the bladder do rankle and impostumate. Lastly (as it oftentimes hath bene found) when the water is long held vp. And albeit there be many sorts of this retention of vrine, which at the last may cause impo∣stumes, vlcers, and much paine: yet is this the totall summe and conclusion, that all of them that detaine or hinder the frée passage of the vrine, do require but one kind of remedie. Notwith∣standing we will in this our discourse following (as much as shall be possible) shew some diffe∣rences in them. Although there haue bene diuers causes shewed before of this disease, yet (to prosecute our accustomed methode) we will recite them once againe: namely, if one haue fallen hard, or haue had a blow or bruse on the bladder. Item the tumors & impostumations which do stop the pas∣sage of the vrine. Also when the back or any other part of the bodie is brused, and the blood falne downe into the bladder, and there lieth clotted. Likewise thicke tough slime or corruption, or o∣ther causes more, &c. whereof partly hath bene spoken of before in the 16. chapter and 7. §. and partly shall be intreated of hereafter more at large. The signes of this maladie are these: if it proceede of any outward cause, that may be in∣quired of the patient. Or if the same be caused through congealed blood, stone, slime or corrup∣tion, then may the same matter be perceiued by the vrine, and by the paine of the place infected, whence the matter commeth. Also by the siluer probe, whereby the stone may be felt, or by the blood and slime which remaineth on the instrument being drawne forth. Of the paine which is caused by the retention of the vrine. §. 2. WE haue amongst other things before made mention of grauell, whereby not onely the patient is grieued with great paine, but also the Phisition is hindered from the application of those remedies as may séeme méete for him: wherefore it is specially aduised, first to delay the paine, or at the least to diminish it; for the which these remedies following are especially commended. All gentle Clisters, easie purgations, and aboue all others, baths of warm
water, wherein Mallowes, Hollihocke rootes, and Nettle rootes, Gromell séeds, or any such like mollifying things and Saxifrages are decocted, wherein these patients are oftentimes to bathe themselues euen to the nauell. Item, take Colewort leaues, Southernwood, Rosemary, pigeon dung, wild Saffron séedes beaten grosly: séeth them all together in water for a bath. Or take Mallowes, Hollihock leaues, Pellitorie of the wall, Southernwood, Creta Marina, Fenegréeke séed, Hollihock séed, of each two handfuls; séeth them all together vnto a bath. Afterwards annoint the kidneyes with the oile of Scorpions, or with any of the foresaid salues. With this bath may this powder following also be vsed with the decoction of pepper: Take the séeds of Purslaine and of small Endiue, of each halfe a dragme, Dill séed two scruples, Mar∣ierom halfe a scruple; giue this to the patient when the paine is present. Note also that these two meates be very good, both for the retention of the vrine, and also for the strangurie. And if so be this be holpen, then will the paine which is in the end of the Yard seene cease. In the description of the kidneyes there may you sée many plaisters, salues and oiles, as that of Anodynum, and others moe, which are very méete for this purpose. Of the stopping of the vrine through the debilitie of the vertue expulsiue. §. 3. IF any one be hindered in the making of his water, or that the same be altogither stopped without any swelling, vlcer, or paine of the Kidneyes, it is then to be censured that the same should come through the debility of the vertue expulsiue: against the which such things shall be vsed as are diureticall, or that do prouoke vrine, as these pils following: Take the seeds of Smallage, Saltpeter, Madder, great Smallage, Iuniper berries, Asarabacca, Ameos, Fennell, Spica, and bitter Almonds, of each one ounce and a quarter, Melons fiue dragmes, Cantharides (the heads and wings cut away) halfe a dragme, Ammoniacum one dragme and a halfe; dissolue your gum in wine, and mixe all the rest being beaten small amongst it; then make pils of them of the bignes of peason, giue thrée of them at one time. These pills haue an especiall efficacie for to drie the bo∣die, so that they are accounted very good for the Dropsie. The Electuarium Ducis is also very good for this purpose, if thou giue one quarter of an ounce of it with pease broth or wine, which thou wilt. There was not long since one cured with this remedie following, who for the space of fiue dayes could neuer make his water: first he tooke this clister: Take Pellitorie of the the wal two handfuls, Mallowes and Cammomill, of each one handfull, boyle them together; then take of this decoction the accustomed quantitie, and temper amongst it one ounce of Cassie, oyle of Cammomill thrée ounces, Turpentine one ounce, Licorice one quarter of an ounce, minister it warme. Secondly, this following was also ordained for him: take Cassie and Turpentine, of each one quarter of an ounce, Benedicta Laxatiua two dragmes, prepared Iewes stones one dragme, make an Electuarie thereof with Oxymel. At night he tooke two ounces of Oxymel with the water of Maidenhaire, and presently after this he made water. Item, take foure or fiue ounces of the iuice of Pellitorie of the wall, and clarifie it with the white of an egge, then séeth it with sugar to a sirupe, and vse three ounces thereof euery morning with the water of Mallowes, or with any such like distilled liquor. This done, giue vnto the patient a purgation of Cassie. Thirdly, take Coriander séedes halfe an ounce, Mallowes one handful, one head of Garlicke, powne them altogether, and séeth them with good white wine vntill that one third part be consumed, and giue him thereof thrée ounces to drinke. Peach kernels and the kernels of Cherrie stones do also prouoke vrine. Item, preserued Pimpernell rootes, Calmus, and the rootes of Eringus are also very good for this purpose, con∣fected Louage séede, Annis séedes, Fennell séedes, Caruway séedes, Comin séedes, and Saxifrage séedes, these do expell all vrine, grauell and stone. Treacle and Mithridate do also cause one to make water. Item, the confection of Cherries with their kernels beaten in péeces, and rubbe it
through a strainer is also méet for this vse: also halfe a dragme of dried Grashoppers is very fit, and a great secret in this disease. Item, the stone which is cut out of a liuing bodie, and vsed as before hath bene shewed in the expulsion of grauell, is also very conuenient and commodious for this intent. Take Tormentill, Pionie, Bistorta, Acornes and wild Flaxe, of each a like much, powne them all together, and take thereof in the euening and morning one dragme with wine. The Spanish flies do expell vrine most violently, but beware of them because they be very sharpe, and exulce∣rate the vreters; but the Grashoppers are somewhat milder. Item take the rootes of Pimpernel beaten small as much as one can containe betwéene his two fingers, and drinke it with wine. The powned shels of Hasell nuts do the like also, and the iawes of Pickerels, if thou take of each of them a like quantitie. But if the vrine be stopped by reason of the stone in the bladder, then giue vnto the patient two small drops of the oile of Sulphur with wine or Agrimonie water: or beate a Radish very small, presse out the iuice of it, and take halfe an ounce thereof with wine; it prouoketh vrine im∣mediatly, and breaketh the stone also. Item, drinke in the morning thrée or foure ounces of Ra∣dish water very warme, and fast two houres after it. In like manner also two in the euening two houres before supper, and walke after it. Another. Take Mallowes and Garlicke, of each a little, séeth them in wine vntill the third part be wasted away, drinke thrée or foure ounces of this decoction at once. Or take Balsamina altera and the lesser burre leaues, boile them together in wine, and drinke it as before. Take a great Onion, cut it small, and Mallowes one handful, boile them in wine, and drink oftentimes of the decoction being warmed. If a child could not make his water, then take ten or twelue bitter Almonds, and ten or twelue Peach kernels, and two ounces of Currans, stampe them all together, straine them through a cloth with water like to Almond milke, and giue it the child to drinke like Almond milke. Amongst the herbed wines are especially commended for the prouoking of vrine the wine of Elecampane, of Harts toong, of swéete Marierom, of Cherries, of Assarabacca, and of win∣ter Cherries, which are also mentioned before in the treatise of the grauell. But if any one might not drinke wine at all or that he had it not, then may he drinke Meade or Hony water, which is also very good. What sirupes and other things might be vsed for the prouoking of vrine, that hath sufficiently bene shewed before in the discourse of the grauell. But Oxymel compositum and the sirupe of Vineger are for this vse very highly commended. Clisters are of no small force in this disease, but especially when they be made with Benedicta and the oile of Scorpions. Amongst the outward remedies are the forementioned bathings the especiallest and the most highly commended. Hereafter follow the descriptions of salues and plaisters. Take a sliced Radish, séeth it to pap, and temper amongst it the oile of bitter Almonds and the oile of Scorpions with a little waxe, then spread this very thicke vpon a cloth, and so lay it vpon the priuities. Item, take Turpen∣tine, oile of Scorpions and of bitter Almonds, of each a like quantitie, and a little molten waxe, then temper them together, and therewith annoint the whole priuities. Another. Take the oile of Scorpions, of Costus, of Lillies, of Dill and Duckes grease, of each halfe an ounce, Pellitorie of the wall and Saxifrage beaten, of each one dragme, Comin thrée dragmes, waxe as much as sufficeth for a salue. For this you may also vse the balmes and oiles which are described in the eight part, like as shall be shewed there more at large. Here before in the affluxion of the humane séede, is also admonished that the nauell is to be filled with a little old suet either of an Oxe or of a Hart; the which is also an expert remedie for the making of water, but that is oftentimes to be vsed. The oile of S. Iohns wort should also expell vrine if one be annointed warme with it. If now there be any bodie which cannot make water, then cut two great Onions, and put a spoonfull of Caruways vnto it, poure then thereon some Sallad oile; afterwards frie them all together, and spread it on a cloth two handfuls broade and méetly long, and so lay it as before vpon the priuities as warme as can be suffered: do this sixe or seuen times together, it helpeth euidently. Item, take Pellitorie of the wall, frie it in oile, and so lay it warme on the priuities.
Some do write that the fat of Conies annointed on the priuities & on the kidneies, should mar∣uellously expell vrine. Likewise also the oile of Bayberries, of Cammomil & of Scorpions. The detension of ye vrine of what cause soeuer it be caused, this ensuing is good for it: take liue or dead wood lice, lay them ouer the priuities before, & then plucke ouer the foreskin: these & Cony fat are by some very highly commended: also ye foreskin is to be put ouer the annointing with cony fat. This ensuing is also highly commended for women when they cannot make water: Take fled Goates horne and Maidenhaire, of each a like quantitie, make them to powder, and strew them on a new hot tile: put this into a close stoole and set the woman vpon it, then sprinkle wine n the tile to the end she may receiue the vapor beneath: this is to be done twice or thrice a day, according as the obstruction of the vrine is great. But if this maladie séeme wholy to get the maistery, then take the water of picked Plantaine, make Almond milke with it, and drinke thereof twice or thrice a day, it is also especiall good. And if so be that the sharpnesse of the vrine had made any excoriation, then annoint the place with the oile of Egges. And if a woman with child cannot make her water, then is she to take yellow Rose seeds and seeth them in wine; when the paine is somewhat asswaged, then giue thereof to drinke: afterwards make a little oile of Lillies warme, and annoint therewith the Raines and ouer all the belly. Item, take Sage and Wormewood, of each one handfull, Rie meale one spoonefull; seeth them all together, and let the woman sitting on a close stoole receiue of the vapor. You haue also in the fift Chapter and 1. §. somewhat else which is also méete for this purpose. Of the retention of vrine through falles or blowes. §. 4. IF the retention of the vrine come of any outward cause, as of fals or of blowes, then must good héed be taken if so be that therby any coagulated or clotted blood, not onely in the bladder, but also in any of the inward parts, came to putrifie, like as in the stomacke, in the breast, and elsewhere, then may great sorrow and trouble procéed of it, yea death it selfe; for that there follow great faintnesse after it, great weaknesse of the whole body, and the pulse will be so small that one can scarse féele it. And to remedie the same, is the Liuer veine of the sicke person to be opened, and the brused place irrigated from on high, oftentimes with warme water wherein Cammomill, Melilot, and Roses be decocted. Afterwards is the sicke person to be annointed with this salue ensuing: Take Myrrhe and Masticke, of each one dragme, oile of Roses one ounce, oile of Dill halfe an ounce, Waxe as much as is néedfull. But if the paine will not abate and cease, and that it appeare that the bruise will come to an impostume and heate, and an ague sticke vnto it, then open the Saphea. If the patient be bound, then are milder clisters and purgations to be vsed, and the patient is to kéepe himselfe as sober in eating and drinking as may be possible the space of two dayes, and afterwards to diet himselfe like as one that hath an Ague is wont to do. The place is to be fomented with the foresaid herbes, and thereupon to annoint it with warme oile of Violets, and with oile of Cammomill. The bladder is softly to be wrung from the top euen to the priui∣ties: also an Oxe bladder may be filled with this decoction following & laid vpon the priuities. Take Mallowes, Cammomill, Rape leaues, Melilot, Violet leaues and Linséede, séeth them together, and make a felt or sponge wet in it, and lay it warme vpon it. You may also make a bath for the loines thereof, putting thereto some Hollihocke rootes, Onions, Garlick, and Cole∣wort leaues powned all together; séeth them and wring them out well, then put them in a bag which hath a hole in the middle to put the yard therein, and that he may lie vpon it. Item, take Wormwood, put it in a bag, séeth it in wine and wring it well out, then lay it vpon the priuities as is expressed, and admonish the patient that he endeuour himselfe to pisse oftentimes. This ensuing is not only good foor the clotted blood in the bladder, but also for all other places of the body, be it of whatsoeuer occasion it may be: Take Wormewood, Fennell, Smallage, the séed of the yellow roote, red Storax, péeled Melon seed, and Radish leaues, of each a like quantity, make a powder of them, and giue thereof betwéene one and two dragmes with Asses milke, or with water wherein Fennell rootes, and the rootes of Smallage, of Parsley, of Sperage, or of Ruscus be decocted.
Of the retention of vrine through some obstruction of the conduits. §. 5. IF so be that it happen that this retention or painful making of water do vexe or paine a bodie, and yet neuerthelesse the bladder is ful of vrine, & that the patient had pist any blood or matter before: then, are those remedies to be giuen him which do open, and which do attenuate the clotted blood and corruption in the bladder, and make it fluxible: therfore one must first begin to wring the priuities hard, that thereby the lowermost passages may be opened, and the vrine may run out. Now if so be that this obstruction do come of clotted blood, of matter, or of slime, then are Sperage water, Saxifrage water and Radish water especially good for it. In like maner is also very good the broth of red Pease, of Fennell rootes, of Parsley rootes, and of Smallage, of each apart, or boiled together. Also Limon water is very much commended for this vse. Item Treacle, good Mithridate, and most of all that which is declared in the retention of the vrine. Also Salt water, or this following may be spouted into the Bladder, which may draw out the vrine through their sharpnes: take burnt ashes of Ferne, Vine ashes and lime, of each a like quantitie, poure as much water vpon it vntil it be couered, let it stand so the space of thrée daies; afterwards poure it through a tight cloth, and spout a little thereof into the bladder. This can also be done with the oile of Scorpions. Item, take the séeds of Carrots, the séed of stone Parsley and of Parsley, of each one quarter of an ounce, Hermodactyli thrée dragmes, make a powder thereof, and giue one dragme thereof at each time. Or take the séed of Smallage, of Parsley, of Pionie, of Broomes, and of Saxifrage, of each one quarter of an ounce, Fennell seed, Caruway and Annis seeds, of each half a dragme, Gromell seedes, Spica, Cinnamome, péeled Melon séedes, Pompeon séedes, Gourd séedes, and péeled Cucumber séed, of each one dragme, Licorice thrée dragmes, Sugar one ounce and a half, make a powder thereof, and giue of it euery day one dragme with some diureticall decoction. If so be that the sicke person haue no stooles, then is the matter first to be prepared with Oxymella diuretico or with Oxymel of Squils, and afterwards to purge with Medicamine Turbith, and with Agarico, or with Benedicta Laxatiua, whereunto are added Hermodactyli: also these ensuing clisters may be vsed. Take Pellitorie of the wall, water Cresses, Saxifrage and Cammomil, of each one handfull, séeth them all together in water, and take twelue or sixteene ounces of this decoction, Benedicta Laxatiua one ounce, Cassie and Hiera piera, of each one quarter of an ounce, oile of Rue thrée ounces, make a clister thereof. For an outward application, take two handfuls of Rue leaues, powne them a little, and frie them with butter, or with oile of sweet Almonds, or oile of scorpions, and lay it on the priuities. Another. Take Dock roots as many as you please, seeth them in wine, frie them, and vse them as before. Or take wheaten bran, let it séeth to pap with oyle of Nuts, and vse it warme. Item, take Pellitorie of the wall, water Cresses, Saxifrage and Diptamus, of each one handful, Fennel and Annis séeds, of each half an ounce; séeth them together in white wine, and wring it out hard, put it betwéene two clothes and lay it on the priuities. You may also put the same decoction in∣to the bladder, and so apply it warme vnto it. Of the first mentioned may also a bath be made, whereunto diureticall medicines shal be ad∣ded, as Cammomill, Stechas, Marierom, Mints, the buds of Colewort stalkes, Pigeon dung, and let the sick person bathe therein as long as he can suffer it. Another. Take Colewort leaues, Hollihock leaues, water Cresses and garden Cresses, Pelli∣tory of the wall, Clauicularis, Cammomil, Smallage and Parsley rootes, of each three handfuls seeth them all together vnto a bath, and then lay the decocted herbes vpon the priuities. For a salue you are to vse Dogs grease and wild Cats grease, of each one ounce, Ammoniacum halfe an ounce, oyle of Lillies two ounces, oyle of Scorpions one ounce, make a salue of it with Waxe, and vse it like as the other salues. Or take the salue which is described in the 3. §. begin∣ning thus, Take oyle of Scorpions, &c. Item, temper Balme and oyle of Roses, of each a like much with Waxe. Further, of all these oyles following may also salues be prepared, as of the oyle of Scorpions, of bitter Almonds, of Lillies, of the kernels of Cherries, and of Pepper; or one may also vse them as they be. For this disease are all things meete that be ordained for the stone of the Bladder and of the Kidneyes.
Of the hote and scalding vrine. §. 6. THere happeneth also otherwhiles such a burning with the vrine, that the patient thinketh none other than that fire passeth through his yard. The cause of this is, that there be mixt with the vrine some hote cholerick or salt humors, which make this scalding in the passage. This cometh commonly of great labour, of much and long walking or trauel∣ling, through heate of the Sunne, through much venery, through long vse of many hot meates, or for that the conduits of the yard haue such exulteration within. This infirmitie is indéed not to be regarded slightly, for if it continue long, then doth it exco∣riate the yard within. The signes thereof be sundry, to wit, when the patient auoideth in his water sometimes matter, small skales like bran, and otherwhiles also blood. These kinds of sicke persons are to beware of all sharpe, salt, sower, and such like meates, because that thereby the paine will be augmented. But he shall contrariwise vse all cooling and moistening things, as well boyled Barley, Spinage, Lettice, Purslaine, Mallowes, Apples, Melons, Pompeons, Gourds, Prunes, Peaches, and Cherries, &c. Item, Lambe, Hens and Partridges drest with the foresaid herbes are the best meate for him. Buttermilke, and that sodden, is also very good for him. He is to take for his drinke Barly water, Buttermilke, watered wine, and fresh water, tem∣pered with sirupe of Violets or sirupe of Roses, Almond milke or Shéepes milke (which is most méete for him) if there be one dragme or two of fiue Bolus tempered amongst it. Item, giue him sirupe of Violets with water of Melons, or if you haue it not, then beate the séedes, and make thereof a decoction, afterwards drinke it with the other meates: in the morning and euening vse this powder following: Take péeled Melon séedes fiue dragmes, péeled Cucumber séedes, Citron séeds and péeled Pompeon séeds, of each one drag. and a halfe, Henbane séed one dragme, Sugar the waight of all the rest, then temper them all together, take thereof euery morning and euening the waight of thrée dragmes with Iulep of Roses. Another. Take péeled Melon séeds, séeds of Pompeons, of Gourds and of Cucumbers chopt smal, of each one ounce, the séeds of Purslaine, of Henbane, and white Poppie séeds, Licorice and Currans, of each one dragme, sugar thrée ounces, temper them together. Item, take Lettice séeds and the seedes of Purslaine, of each halfe an ounce, powned Sugar two ounces, make a powder thereof, and vse it in all meates and drinkes, it is maruellous good, yea for all old folkes also. These Trociskes following do coole and cleanse the kidneyes and the bladder of all such mat∣ter which doth inflame or ouerheate the conduits of vrine. Take péeled Melon séeds, Pompeon séedes, Gourd séedes and péeled Cucumber séedes, of each halfe an ounce, Dragagant, red Saunders, of each one dragme and a halfe, Purslaine séeds, white Poppie séeds, of each thrée drag. white Henbane séeds one dragme, make Trocisks thereof with the muscilage of Fleawort, afterwards take one dragme of them and breake if in Barly water, & giue it early in the morning and at night going to bed. You may also make an electuary of it. Cassie taken with Turpentine is also espcially good for this purpose. The oile of swéet Almonds asswageth and cooleth also the heate of the conduits of vrine. If in case then the patient (because of the sharpnesse of the matter) ought to be purged more, then is the same to be done with sower Dates, Manna, and Rubarb stéeped in Endiue water, or with the decoction of Violets: if there be salt phlegme with it, then giue him Cassie tempered with the whay of Goates milke, wherein Polipodie roots, Annis, Violets and Burrage flowers haue bene decocted. When he hath thus bene purged, then is the Liuer veine to be opened, and the foresaid powder to be diligently vsed. If so be that a child hath this disease, then take Mallow séedes, Dragagant & Licorice, of each a like quantitie, seeth them in water according to the importance of the cause, and let him drink none other drinke. If his vrine be very sharpe and hot, then take so much the more of the séedes. And in ease that a child through the sharpnes of the vrine had gotten some exulceratiō, then vse this salue ensuing: Take Myrrhe halfe an ℥, Barly meale or Beane meale, one ℥, temper it to a soft vnguent with the oyle of Roses, spread it on a cloth, and then lay it where it is néedfull. The brayed white of an egge may also be spouted into the priuities, or take the muscilage of Fleawort and of Quince kernels, of each one dragme, temper them with womans milke.
Or take the séed of Fleawort thrée quarters of an ounce, the séede of Quinces fiue dragmes, péeled Melon séeds, Pompeon séeds, Gourd séeds, and péeled Cucumber séedes, of each one quar∣ter of an ounce, white Poppie séedes one dragme and a halfe; séeth them all together in a pint of water vntill the third part be wasted, then straine it through a cloth that it may be like a musci∣lage, and spout thereof into the yard, it cooleth and asswageth the paine. You shall vse outwardly red and white Saunders, the séedes of Ruscus, burnt Iuorie, and Myrtle séedes, of each one quarter of an ounce, the iuice of Plantaine and Rose water, of each one ounce, Barley meale as much as sufficeth, then powne them all together, and make a soft pap of it: you may also put vnto it two whites of egges. But if one desire to haue it stronger, then is the iuice of Sloes and Hypocistis, of each one dragme to be tempered amongst it, and so to be layed vpon it. If so be that the yard haue an exulceration within, then is a cloth to be made wet in Rose water and layed vpon it. If any one be forced against his will to make his water. §. 7. ALthough this disease which the learned do call Diamnem, be somewhat like vnto Diabetes, and especially in this, that in both sorts of these diseases the vrine pas∣seth away against ones will and pleasure, yet is there neuerthelesse a great dif∣ference betweene them, for that with the disease Diabetes is a great heate of the kidneyes, her attractiue vertue is against nature, whence followeth a great thirst, and great quantitie of vrine, all which is not with the disease Diamnes. For Diamnes is none other but a continuall fluxe of the vrine against a bodies will without any paine or heate, and also without any feeling of it. The occasions of this maladie may be when the muscles of the necke of the bladder be perished, like as otherwhiles hapneth in cutting of the stone. This can also chaunce through falles, through blowes, or through great cold, as to fit vpon a cold stone, through cold sicknesses, as the Palsie or Litharge: item, through immoderate and excessiue drinking, and through great binding in the bodie. They may likewise happen vnto women with child, when the child oppresseth the bladder too hard. Lastly also through some impostumes about those parts. The signes of this disease are apparant, to wit, that all warme things are acceptable to the patient, and cold things contrary are hurtfull. When these diseases (as often befalleth) are caused through cold, then is this electuary very good, which hath efficacie for to stay this fluxe of vrine. Take Cypers nuts, the rinds of Cypers, Frankinsence and the rinds of the same, Mirtle séed, Comin, Mirobalans both fried, and drie pigeon dung, of each thrée dragmes, Amber, red Coral, and Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, sirupe of Quinces as much as is néedful for to make an electuary therewith, whereof is to be taken euery morning, noone and euening, the hignesse of a Chestnut, with a decoction of Cipers nuts, Sage, Mirtle seede, and such like. This electuary is also good for the laxes called Diarrhaea and Lienteria. Another. Take Mirobalani Chebuli, Emblici and Bellirici, of each thrée dragmes, Acornes thrée dragmes and a halfe which haue laid foure and twentie houres stéeped in vineger, Cypers rootes, Mirtle séeds, Frankinsence, dried Glecampane rootes, red Storax, red Corall, and yellow séeds of Roses, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Myrrhe one dragme and a halfe, stampe them small, and make an electuary thereof with clarified honie. For this is also good Treacle, Mithridate, and burnt Oxe bladders, each taken alone with wine. Item, take the dried kidneyes of a Hare, stampe them to powder, and Dill séede,  each halfe an ounce, the séede of Smallage one quarter of an ounce, make a powder thereof and giue it be twéene two and thrée dragmes at once with a little cold water: boyled Hedge hogs flesh is also very commodious for this purpose. If so be that the patient haue any néed of stooles, then is this clister following very commodi∣ous for it, for when he keepeth it very long, then doth it strengthen the necke of the bladder and draweth it together, that it doth afterwards kéepe the vrine the better: Take Sage Rue Gl∣cularis, field Cypers, Cammomill, Stechas, Nuts, flowers and rinds of Cypers, of each half a M. then let them seeth together, and vse this Clister like as is accustomed, but mixe the oyle of Ba∣uercod and of Behen, of each two ounces amongst it, powder of rosted Chebuli, Mirtle séeds and Cypers rootes, of each one dragme and a halfe; lastly temper them all together.
Outwardly may he vse the Minerall and Sulphurish baths, but if one cannot get them, then make a drie sweating bath with the foresaid herbes, which are named in the description of the clisters, which also one may vse for a bath for the Raines, if the same be sodden in Wine or lye, and put Salt or Allume vnto it. The priuities and bladder are also to be annointed with these oiles following, whether they be tempered together or each apart, viz. with oile of Beuer∣cod, of Behen and Elderne, amongst which there may be a litle Pieretrum, pepper, and the rinds of the Cypers frée mixed. His order of diet consisteth principally in this, to wit, that he do not ouercharge himselfe nei∣ther with eating nor drinking, and vse nothing which forceth vrine, as Radishes, Cucumbers, Melons, parsly, fruite, and such like. He is also to refraine from all cleare, white, delicate Wine, and from Syder, but is rather to drinke a red, thicke, hard, and vnwatered wine. He must strew his meate with powned Comin which is somewhat parched: also with a little Mustard séede, pepper, Caruway, or which he please; and he must specially beware of all that ingendreth much moisture in the bodie. Rosted Chestnuts and Hasell nuts be very good for him. Of the excoriation of the Bladder, and of the necke of the same. §. 8. THe causes of this disease may be a precedent impostume, or some sharpe humor of the bodie, the vse of some hote meates and drinkes which are salted too much, or some thing else which doth exacuate the vrine, as is before discouered. The signes of it are detention of the vrine, and although the same haue some small passage, yet hapneth it with anguish and great paine of the priuities, and of other parts adiacent. In the vrine are small skales to be séene, and other∣whiles blood and corruption, the which doth stinke. And now for to remedie this, then looke what hath bene prescribed against the grauell, stone, and such like, for all that is also méete for this purpose, and therefore not néedfull to be rehearsed at this present. But here is especially needfull a good order of diet, as hereafter followeth: all salt, sower, sharpe and swéete meates, also all great exercise must he refraine: yet all mild meates, and spe∣cially Sheepes milke is he to vse. He is to vse for phisicke such things which do mundifie and cleanse the vlcers of their corrup∣tion, viz. Trociscos Alkekengi three dragmes with sirupe or Iulep of Violets. He is also oftentimes to drinke meade, Sief album Rasis one dragme or two tempered with milke is oftentimes to be iniected into the bath, or honywater wherein figs be decocted. Of the impostume of the Bladder, or of the necke of the same. §. 9. THere do come very seldome impostumations in the bladder, or in the necke of the same; yet when they come there, then commonly be they caused through bruises, blowes and falles vpon the same place, or such like. Item, through a sweatie and bloodie bodie, which is mixed with Cholera, repletion of the Matrix and of the Kid∣neyes, whence the matter falleth into the Bladder, and there impostumateth: the stone in the bladder may also cause the same. The signes of these impostumes are Agues which be caused of paine, also biting and pricking paine aboue the priuities, swelling of the same place with heate, which is also to be perceiued by ng detention of the vrine, the which the patient cannot otherwise auoide but standing only. Herewith commeth also oppilation of the body, parbraking of Cholera, heau breath, cold of the outward parts, swelling of the toong, distemperance of the braines: they be also distempered though hot and dureticall things: age, hot weather, and a licentious life do trouble and harme these patients greatly. In these impostumes be certaine common rules prescribed. First, if so be that this impo∣ be in the bladder, in the necke of the bladder, or in the yard, then is do diureticall medi∣e to be giuen him. Secondly, the matter which causeth these impostumes, is to be deriued to ther place, except it were in the plague, for then ought first a veine to be opened. Thirdly, when it is knowne which humor is most peccant, then must one looke to purge the same with
appropriated medicines: fourthly, there be not any attractiue clisters (neither in the beginning nor augmenting of the impostume) to be vsed, to the end that by the affluence of the humor the impostume be not augmented; but one is to vse only mild things, so that through the great bin∣ding in the body there ensue no hurt; fiftly, repelling medicines are not to be too long vsed, that the matter be not made too grosse, and those parts which be cold by nature be more refrigerated and cooled: sixtly, whensoeuer through cooling things the outward accidents be somwhat eased, then are such things to be vsed as may asswage the paine: seuenthly, if there but a little moi∣sture in the patients bodie, then are besides the expulsiue pudicaments, also bathing & rubbing is to be vsed: eightly, if there be any impostumes in the necke of the bladder, then must one be∣ware to vse any instrument about or in it, for that in doing so you might hinder the matter greatly: ninthly, when the detained vrine, neither of it selfe, nor of any instrument may be let∣ten out, then are other meanes to be vsed, whereof we haue written somewhat before. Thus for to helpe this disease, is in the beginning the Basilica to be opened, according to the prescription of the second rule, and let out as much blood as shall seeme meete. But if the patient find himselfe meetly strong, and if so be that the matter be much, then is the Saphea to be opened the next day after. If the impostume be through heate, as of blood or Cholera, then take oyle of Roses and vnripe Sallad oyle, of each one ounce, Vineger halfe an ounce, temper them all to∣gether, afterwards annoint it vpon the place of the paine, and then strew vpon it this powder following: Take Myrtle seed, Roses, Dragon blood, and white Saunders, of each a like quanti∣tie, poune them al together to pouder, & lay a cloth vpon it dipped in the foresaid oile of Myrtles. The patient is also to be purged with lenitiue medicines and gentle clisters, thereby to molli∣fie the hardnes of the impostume and to asswage the paine, and so to open the conduits of vrine. Of all which you haue had good direction before. Besides these is this fomentation following very meet: Take Cammomill, Melilot, of each thrée ounces, Hollihocke rootes, Fenegréeke, Lin∣seed, of each one ounce and a halfe; let them all seeth well together in water, and then bathe the place affected therewith the space of an houre: afterwards fill a bladder with this decoction a∣bout halfe full, and lay it warme vpon the priuities, then annoint the priuities with oyle of Cammomill, with oile of Lillies, and such like, euen as in the impostume of the kidneyes hath bene declared more at large. For this is also very méet water baths, wherein Mallowes, Hollihock roots, Cammomil, Lin∣séede, Melilot, Marierom, Cipers roots, Rape leaues, Colewort, Fenegréeke, and such like be de∣cocted. If it be néedfull to vse warming oiles, then take oile of Lillies, of S. Iohns wort, of Rue, of sweet and bitter Almonds, of wall flowers: all these oiles do allay the paine, as also doth the oile of tyles, and the plaister of Barberries, which consume all cold humors. When as this impostume is broken, then follow the same course as hath bene taught in the impostumes of the kidneyes. To conclude, these things following are much commended to be eaten for all diseases of the bladder, viz. preserued Elecampane rootes and Pimpernell rootes, which expell all vncleannesse from the stomacke: likewise also preserued Calmus, Treacle, Mithridate, conserue of Betony, Meade and Hony water. Item, the iuice of Limons which is especiall good for all brusings of the bladder that were caused of the stone. The nineteenth Chapter. Of the Matrix or VVombe. FRom the beginning of this booke of Phisicke hitherto we haue written and discoursed of all the principall inward parts of our body, concerning as well men as women; but concerning the Matrix, which is onely pro∣per to the female kind, haue we deferred vntill this present, and now we will intreate somewhat thereof. This matrix or wombe is the chiefest part whereby the generation of mankind is maintained, and ordained of God Almightie (Creator of nature it selfe) as for a vessell, receiuer and preseruatiue place of humane seed, which is therein formed vnto a liuing creature, increased, defended, nourished, and sustai∣ned vntill the opportune time of birth.
The Grecians do call this Matrix or Wombe Metra and Hystera, the Latinists Matrix, Vlua, Vterus, and we, by reason of her vertue, for that it incloseth the conceiued child, the Mother or Wombe. This hath her place in the neathermost part of the Belly, right vnder the Nauell. It reacheth backwards to the Arsegut, and forward to the Bladder. It is deuided into two parts, whereof the first part is her whole bodie, wherein (as is said) humane séede is receiued, and the fruit preserued. The second part is the necke of the Matrix or Wombe, which reacheth out of the formost part of the priuities, so that it is assimulated vnto the Bladder with her neck, the ligaments, wherewith she is bound to the hips, onely excepted. When this Matrix or womb with all that belongeth thereto is rightly beholden, then is it onely shapen like to a mans mem∣ber, only that the humane member dependeth outwardly, and that the womanhood lieth hidden within, whereof before in the beginning of the fift Chapter, and afterwards hath bene spoken at length. Her substance is inwardly fleshie and rough, especially in the bottome strewed all ouer with small knops or bunches, which be full of small veines, that come and haue their accourse from all parts of the bodie vnto the wombe, and in carnall vse do draw and keepe with them the hu∣mane séede, which also yéeld forth the flowers or termes, nourish the conceiued fruite, and maintaine the secondine. Also this Matrix hath two concauities, and it is supposed that in the concauitie on the right side Sonnes be conceiued, and in that on the left side the Daughters, whereof we shall speake hereafter more at large. Outwardly she is full of sinewes and hard, because that she openeth and shutteth too againe in the bearing of children, all which must be atchieued and brought to passe through the sinews: the same hardnes doth also defend her from many kinds of brusings. The foresaid sinewes be also causes of her motion, and ascending and descending in the body, for that because these sinewes are very sensible and easily harmed, therefore they do shrinke in and draw the mother vpwards with great painfulnesse, as hereafter shall be shewed more at large. The neck of the wombe which is with some women long, and with some short, whereof the right measure is the breadth of eleuen fingers, is shapen of a hard muskelly and sinewy flesh, which so hardeneth from day to day (especially in leacherous women or common harlots, and old women) that it is at the last altered into a kind of Cartilage. This necke of the Matrix hath also where the mother beginneth, an entrance which is neuer more opened but in the venerious act, in time of the termes, and in the birth, otherwise doth it remaine alwayes most tightly shut, and especially after the receit of the humane séed, so that no∣thing may go in or out. In yong maidens or girles it is very thinne, but in growing it waxeth thicker and bigger, viz. when the termes be at hand, and lesseneth when they be past: the thick∣nesse also increaseth with the being with child; and how many times moe that she beareth child so much the thicker doth it grow. In like sort also will it be harder and thicker in time of the first conception, but in the growing and increase of the child is it dilated, to the end the fruite might haue toome and scope: but in women that neuer conceiued, or haue not borne any chil∣dren at all, it continueth in one bignesse, and is much lesse than in fruitfull women. In like ma∣ner it is also in children much smaller than the bladder, but with growing vp it dayly waxeth greater, yea that it is at last in greatnesse farre excéeding the bladder. These kinds and such like sundry motions, like as they haue delight in odoriferous things, and a loathing of stinking things, for which it flieth, and for which it ascendeth, caused the wise Philosopher Plato to write as hereafter followeth: This part in women, which many do call Metram and Hysteram, is a liuing creature, very gréedie of conception, therefore if it be drawne vpwards vntimely, and if it remaine a long space vnfruitfull, then doth it become vnwilling, it créepeth through the whole bodie, whereby the parts of respiration are so obstructed and stopt, that the woman can get no breath, yea it bringeth with it at the last great danger and perill, and causeth many kinds of sicknesses. These be the words of Plato, but this opinion is with∣stood by Galen. This noble part in women is subiect to many kinds of diseases and sicknesses, which if they o get the vpper hand, do hinder the conception and the fruitfulnesse of women; which vnfruit∣fulnes is especially caused when she hath too many of her termes, or too few, or when the same is wholy detained, whence then followeth a spoile of the natural seed, the whites, the suffocation of
the mother, which otherwhiles stifleth women, the precipitation and falling out of the same, great paine, vlcers, impostumes, hardnings, Canker, the vnnaturall disease Mola, barrennesse, and if she peraduenture chance to conceiue an vntimely birth, whereof hereafter shall be writ∣ten, yet first we will begin of womens termes and flowers. Of the Termes or Flowers of women in generall. §. 1. THat these Termes of women be called the Flowers, is for this cause, viz. when it is séene that a trée bloweth, then is it esteemed meete and conuenient to beare fruite, and contrariwise the trée vnfruitfull which bloweth not, except the Fig trée. So is it likewise with women, that all they that haue their Termes are fit and commodious to conceiue and beare children, the which they that haue not their flowers or termes, can neuer more accomplish. Secondly, the Latinists do cal these flowers Menstrua, of the moneth, and thus, for they euery moneth or thirty dayes returne and come againe; or for that they according to the course of the Moone, that is, because they appeare the first quarter of the Moone in young girles, the second quarter in them that be somewhat bigger, the third quarter in the middle sort, the last quarter in aged women. Whereby all expert Phisitions do obserue in each time that each age is to haue them, to wit, the yong people in the new and increasing Moone, the old folkes in the decrease of the Moone: in fine, the health of all women dependeth especially in this necessary menstruall fluxe, yea all her chastitie, fruitfulnesse and welfare. To the contrary, if they do not at all auoid, do flow too much, vnorderly, or be lothsome of co∣lour, then do they cause all miseries, inclination to venery, and many kind of sicknesses, like as hereafter shall be taught. Wherewith it is to be estéemed for no smal work of wonder, that amongst all creatures that do liue and are of the female kind (except certaine Apes) only women are subiect vnto this fluxe, and therefore haue the Philosophers many kinds of disputations, which be here too long and néedlesse to be rehearsed. But of the fountaine and matter of this blood, it is with one consent concluded, that it is a cold, vndigested and grosse matter, and the blood of the whole bodie, the which through the foresaid veines is gathered together in ye womb, and is afterwards expelled in due time as a matter hurtfull and of no vse. That this matter is also cold, is by this percei∣ued, that when it passeth away, the woman féeleth a great cold ouer the whole bodie, this hap∣peneth after many fashions. Of the Termes that be auoided ouer and aboue their naturall cu∣stome, shall be hereafter spoken of with all their appertenances. The women whose Termes auoide in two or thrée dayes, are ridde of them with small trouble, but if they endure long, then will they be thereby very féeble. The first auoidance of their Termes is commonly about the fouretéenth yéere, the which signifieth that then their naturall séede beginneth to ripen, that the haire and breasts beginneth to grow, and they that be hote of nature do then get desire of the man, for that the womans Termes be none other but a naturall séede which is not yet throughly ripe, and that through his superfluitie of nature desireth to be expelled. This course of the Termes or Flowers aba∣teth about the age of fortie or two and fortie yeares, or endureth sometimes vntill the fiftith yéere, but very seldome vntill the sixtith yéere, in which time women be still méete and fit for ge∣neration; yet do these Flowers or Termes of women come sometimes sooner and sometimes la∣ter, according to that the nature and complexion of the bodie is full of blood, strong, suffereth much labour, is quiet and feeble. It is also a common rule with all them that haue experience in naturall things, that a woman which getteth not her flowers, like as some which be hot & drie by nature, is barren and vnfruitfull, and that for those causes that are discouered in the seuenth Chapter of the barrennesse of men and women, although that it chanceth neuerthelesse (but ve∣ry seldome) that such women do conceiue and beare. This is also the natural custome, that when a woman hath conceiued, that then her termes do tary away, for this blood is prepared for a sustenance vnto the child in the mothers womb; like as also after childbirth ye same to that end is turned into milke, notwithstanding that it oftentimes happeneth that women with child auoide their Flowers or Termes after the old custome vntil the very day of birth, as we shall hereafter somewhat intreate thereof: but these women do
bring small, spare, weake, and not liuing children into the world, because they haue bene depri∣ued of the most part of their nourishment. It is also contrary to the opinion of many women, that she shall open a veine when she is halfe gone with child, in case she be not full of blood, and the veines not great, therefore is not the same very vnaduisedly to be done. Item, in this flow∣ing or course of womens termes, there is another wonderfull nature and propertie, to wit, that so harmefull and venimous a matter in mans bodie, without any hinderance, yea for a great preferment of health, may be retained and expelled. The common experience bringeth with it, and all learned do testifie the same, that these womens termes do bring innumerable sicknesses with them, and haue many infectious properties: namely, where the same happeneth to fall, there groweth no fruite, spoileth the vines, the Must will be vineger, the herbes wither, the trées drie away, iron rusteth, and all mettals do darken and waxe dim: the same being taken make a man madde, and chiefly the dogges: the Bées leaue their hiues if they be annointed therewith: women when they haue the same, then do they darken through their breath all bright looking glasses, the aire wil be poisoned with them, and children (as it is said) bewitched. Now doest thou sée thou stout high minded man, what a precious matter it is that thou hast in the beginning of thy birth, and what the matter is that hath thee nourished? This hath cau∣sed the auncient Poets to assimulate this fluxe vnto the warres, saying, that Mars is no son of the god Iupiter, but of Iuno onely, meaning by Iuno this menstruall fluxe. And truly if this hurtfull propertie be likened to the warres, then is it an expert and true similitude: for what doth more spoile fruites, vineyards, Must, herbes and trées, than the warres? what is there which taketh away and wasteth more iron? how many bright harnesses be thereby darkened? where beareth madnes more mastery? where are men more like to mad dogs than in the wars? how can the aire be more venimed than through the stinking dead bodies? Here is now suffi∣ciently spoken of this matter, now we will procéede with our medicines. How to preferre and moue the Termes or Flowers in women. §. 2. FOr the first, we will speake of the causes whereby the termes be detained, the which be outward and inward. The outward causes be sore labour, hunger, care, great satnesse, agues, dropsies, consumptions, and some disease of the wombe. The inward causes be a bad complexion, of heate, cold, dryth, or of moisture, whereby the vertue expulsiue is weakened, so that it is not strong enough for to vnburthen her selfe of the superfluities. Or that there be any maladie in the Matrix or mother, to wit, if the necke of the wombe be stopt and obstructed, and is swolne too, like as it may easily happen in the mother or in the veines of the same. Now for to haue some certaine or infallible knowledge of these things, there may outward causes be easily perceiued by the declaration of the patient her selfe. If it come through weake∣nesse of the expulsiue power, then is it perceiued by the heate, by the thirst, by the swift and strong pulse, and other signes of heate. But if such be caused through cold, then is the woman bleake, sléepie, without any thirst, the arteries of the pulse beate slowly, and the vrine is of loth∣some colour. If the disease be of any inward part, then doth the whole bodie declare the same through the great fatnesse or leannesse. If such be caused through any of the foure humors, that doth the blood sufficiently shew, which therein beareth sway. This obstruction doth bring to women no small sicknesse, besides that (as it is said) they be barren, for that they fall thereby otherwhiles into Maniam, (which is madnes) into the falling sicknesse, suffocation, swellings, and impostumes of the wombe, and of the other parts adiacent vnto it, slothfulnesse and heaui∣nesse of the whole body, great vnlustinesse, wambling and parbraking, coughing, and a heauy breathing, the dropsie and detension of the vrine, and of going to the stoole, heauines of the mind, great paine of the head, and at last into the gout. And to remedie all these diseases, therefore will we first of all prescribe certaine common rules, whereof the first is, in case that the Termes be obstructed in a drie bodie, then must one beware of all those things that might cause either heate or dryth, to the end the disease be not increased thereby. The second is, if in the stay or detension of womens flowers the bloud had course towards any other part of the bodie, then is it aduised that the same blood be drawne out,
which otherwise might be spoyled. Thirdly, to preferre these flowres, it is then néedfull that the veines be opened vnder the Matrix, that the blood may be drawne downewards. Fourthly, there is meete for this the strong binding of the thighes, and to hold the same a certaine time bounden. Fiftly, if the disease come for that the veines be stopt in the Matrix, (be it of what∣soeuer occasion that it will) then is the blood to be diminished by opening of a veine, and to be diminished through laxatiue medicines, through abstinence, through exercise, and such like meanes. Sixtly, all strong things, as Hellebore, Euphorbium and Nardus séed (which is wont sometimes to be adhibited from below) must be but a very little, and not to be holden long therein, to the end that thereby the Ague nor any other anguish be caused. Seuenthly, all that moueth the vrine doth also moue the Termes. Eightly, where there is obserued no good order of diet in eating or drinking, there can also no good aduice nor remedie doe any good at all. Ninthly, for to preferre the Termes, is first of all the same to be approoued through gentle re∣medies, and at the last through stronger meanes. Tenthly, all warme and well sauoring things are very meete for this if they be layed vpon the nauell, vpon the priuities, and vpon the parts about it. Eleuenthly, if this disease be caused through any vlcer, impostume, Ague, or any other cause, it is first to be practised how to remedie, and afterwards to moue the flowres. Twelftly, in case it be perceiued that this detention of the flowres or termes doth cause any other sicknes, or increaseth it, then is all diligence to be had to prouoke the Termes: and if fo be that the same cannot be effected, then may the veine be opened in the foote, and boxing cuppes be adhibited. Thirtéenthly, because there is a great space from the stomacke and the liuer vnto the Matrix, then is the Phisicke so to be tempered, that the same in so great a distance be not inféebled. Fourtéenthly, all that is to be put vp into the wombe is to be tied to a strong thréed, that one when he list may draw it out, and to the end also that through the long continuance there, it bruse not the necke of the mother, or cause not an Ague. And to the end that we may come to the remedies for to open this obstruction, therefore first of all be the causes of these obstructions to be thought vpon, in case that the same be caused of some outward accident, like as of too great labour, great heate, of too much fasting, and such like, then is the same presently to be preuented. In hote causes are cooling things to be vsed: in cold warming things, which do open the obstructions. In a bodie that is full of blood are the veines vnder the knees to be opened, which be most necessary to people that haue not the terms: and if so be that horeby, and other moe lettings of blood is nothing profited, then is one to come to the inward and outward remedies, wherein be thrée manner of wayes to be followed, which shall be here described, of which each one may chuse what séemeth to be the best and fittest for it. And because that it is not bad counsel to rehearse and shew the simples which may stirre vp the termes, therefore we wil here discouer a good part of them, and first all that be warme by na∣ture, and are weakest, are these, the rootes of Smallage, of Fennell, of Butchers broome, of Spe∣rage, of Parsley, of Grasse, Madder, Calmus, Asarabacca, Ireos, Valerian, white Diptamus and Elecampane rootes. Item, the séede of Ruscus, Lupins, séedes of both kinds of Parsley, of Siluer mountaine, of Sperage, of Smallage, of Annis, of Fennell, of Comin, whether it be raw or con∣fected: the herbes are these, Cinquefoile, Mugwort, wild Mints, Marierom, Feuerfew, Harts toong, Spikenard, Wormewood, white water Mints, Iuniper, wild Thyme, Louage, Cuscuta, Maidenhaire, Southernewood, and washt Turpentine. These ensuing be much stronger, as Hemlocke, Rue, Centorie, Laureola, Sauin, Euphorbium, Ammoniacum, Sagapenum, Mirrha, Opopanacum, and Assafoetida, the séede of Nardus, Mustard séede, Pepper, Beuercod, Colloquint, blacke Hellebore, Pieretrum, Calmus, rootes of Celandine, the iuice of wild Cucumbers, Licebane séedes, Boras, the galles of stéeres, of hens, and of all other beasts. The odoriferous things which preferre womens termes, be these, Indie Spica, Cinnamom, Cassie wood, Costus roots, Ameos, Muscus, Spica Romana, Squinant, Gallia Muscata, and such like. They that may be burnt to receiue the vapor thereof be these, viz. Opopanacum, Saponaria, Fran∣kinsence, Blatta Byzantia, Lignum Aloes, and red Storax. These be now the cooling things which preferre the termes, to wit, the séeds of small Endiue. the séede of Melons, of Gourds, of Pompeons, of Cucumbers, of Endiue, of Lettice, &c. and other moe which shall be discouered hereafter; of all which pessaries may be made to vse in the wombe; also plaisters, salues, powders, oiles, potions and baths, all as the cause requireth, and
that necessitie compelleth, like as there be many sundrie described hereafter, and now we will procéede. The first meanes for to prouoke the Termes is to be described somewhat at length, wherein there be many sundry medicines of diuers and sundry Phisitions ordained and added together, out of which each may choose what is méete for him; but in the other twaine we will be some∣what briefer, therefore one may take out of them all that might be wanting in this, and so first begin with those things which be méete for this to bring the bodie vnto health, and to shew therwithal how such obstructions and hinderances of the termes may be taken away, for which this sirupe following is to be prepared: Take Mather two ounces, Louage rootes, the rootes of Sperage, Cipers rootes and Grasse rootes, of each one ounce and a halfe, Siluer mountaine two ounces, Baulme two ounces, Balsam wood and the fruites of the same, of each one ounce, Spica of Indie halfe a dragme, Licorice, Currans, Rosemary flowers, and Stechados, of each one ounce, Honie sixe ounces, white Sugar nine ounces, boyle a sirupe of it, clarifie it, and giue thereof two ounces tempered with the decoction of Céeres. Another. Take Mather two ounces, Sperage rootes, the rootes of Butchers broome, and Cypers rootes, of each one ounce, Corne mints, Valerian, Sauine, white Water mints, and Penniroyall, of each one handfull, Baulme two handfuls, Siluer mountaine two ounces, Bal∣sam wood and the fruites of the same, péeled Melon seede, of each one ounce, Spikenard halfe an ounce, Licorice, Currans, of each halfe an ounce, Honie and Sugar, of each sixe ounces, make a sirupe of it, and giue thereof at each time one ounce and a halfe, or two ounces, with the broth of Céeres. Another. Take the water of Smallage, water of Lupins, of Sperage, and of Fennell, of each sixe ounces, Indie Spica one quarter of an ounce, Cinnamome one dragme, Ammoniacum and Opopanacum, of each one dragme and a halfe, Parsley séed, Fennell séeds, Ameos, wild yellow Rape seede and Caruway, of each one quarter of an ounce, Gromell seed, stone Parsley seed and Agrimonie of each one handfull, Galingall, Cinnamome and Saffron, of each halfe a dragme, sirupe of Violets two ounces, Quince kernels, Mallowes séede, of each halfe an ounce: seeth them al together in two quarts of Gourds water vntill the third part be wasted, straine it tho∣rough, and then temper it with a litle of the foresaid water and the sirupe of Violets amongst it, and boyle it with so much honie as you please. Last of all strew some Cinnamome in it, and as much vineger of Squils, vntill it be somewhat sourish, then vse it as the former: this forceth very vehemently the Termes. For this is also very good the common sirupes which be alwayes prepared at all substantiall Apothecaries, as the sirupe of Mugwort, of Maidenhaire, of Cicorie, with Rubarbe, and the si∣rupe of fiue rootes. When as now this sirupe hath bene vsed like as behooueth, then must be procéeded: and for to procéed orderly, it is very needfull that women be purged of all superfluous humours, which may be done very commodiously with the confection Benedicta or Hiera picra, tempered with the decoction of Madder: and of the foresaid confections you may vse thrée quarters of an ounce, or an ounce, each a part or together. Afterwards are these laxatiue things to be vsed: Take Sene leaues, Penniroyall and Madder, of each a like quantitie; séeth them in small white wine, and giue thereof about thrée ounces at once. Or take Penniroyall, Nep, Southernwood, Rue, Centorie and Hyssop, of each one handfull, Sauin, Feuerfew, of each one handfull and a halfe, Opopanacum, Ammoniacum, Galingall, of each one dragme, Cinnamome, Madder, of each one handfull, Myrrhe one quarter of an ounce; seeth them all together with a quart of water vntil the third part be wasted, then take thereof two or thrée ounces fasting at one time. Item, take the rootes of Smallage, of Sperage, of Fennell, of Parsley, of Carduus Benedictus, and of Butchers broome, of each one ounce and a halfe, Annis, Fennell, Caruway and Ameos, of each one dragme and a halfe, Mugwort, Penniroyall, mints, Horehound, Feuerfew and A∣sarabacca, of each halfe a handfull; séeth them all together in two quarts of water vnto the halfe, wring it together through a cloth, and mixe therewith the sirupe of the fiue rootes, de Calamintha, de Artemisia, of each a like quantitie, drinke thereof in the morning and at afternoone. Another. Take mints, Balme, Penniroyall, Marierom, and Southernwood, of each one handfull, Annis, Fennell, Caruway, of each one ounce, the rootes of Polipodie one ounce and a
halfe, Cicorie rootes one ounce; cut the rootes of the herbes very small, and séeth them in a quart of water vntill the third part be consumed, afterwards straine it through, and make it as swéete as you please. Another potion with Wine: Take Sauine and Mugwort, of each one handfull, put two quarts of wine vnto it, and let them seeth together vntill the third part be wasted: take thereof in the euening and morning at each time two spoonfuls. Do you now desire to make a common potion? then take Wormewood and Rue, of each one handfull, fiue or sixe pepper cornes, séeth them all together in a quart of Wine, straine it then through, and drinke thereof. In like maner may you séeth Mallowes in wine and drinke thereof, it is also very good. This potion following is very good and pleasant: Take a pint of good Wine, Sage halfe a handful, Cloues, Saffron and Mace, of each halfe a scruple, stamp them all together, and bind it in a fine cloth, and hang it a night and a day in wine, wring it out oftentimes, deuide it into three parts, and take one draught of it fiue houres before meate, the other draught after noone, and the last after supper. But this is to be done in the wane of the Moone, and eate very little. Item, take Hartwort and Pepper, of each one dragme, poure a pint of wine vpon it, and drinke thereof in the euening and morning, it moueth much, and clenseth the womb or Matrix from all bad humors. Or take the herbe Caruway one handfull, Mugwort one handfull and a halfe, Arsmart one handfull, Asarabacca one dragme; séeth them together in two quarts of water vntill about the halfe, and drinke thereof in the morning fasting a good draught. Another. Take Penniroyall one handful, Marierom gentle as much also, Mace one dragme, and one quarter of an ounce of Bayberries beaten grossely, bind them all together in a cloth, and poure thereon twelue ounces of wine; but let them séeth together in a Can in hote water the space of an houre, afterwards wring out the cloth, and drinke the halfe of this Wine in the morning, and the other halfe in the euening after the mealetide. Item, take Mugwort, Feuerfew, Penniroyal, Baulme and Mallowes, of each one handful, séeth them together in a pint and a halfe of wine, and vse them as before. Take the rootes of Cicorie foure handfuls, take out the wooddie hart, and cut them smal, then poure two quarts of wine vpon it, and let it séeth so long vntill the force be gone out of it, after∣wards wring it out, and then séeth it vnto a thin sirupe, and so take euery morning a spoonefull or twaine of it. This following doth open much all obstructions, and forceth the Termes: Take of the con∣fection Triphera without Opium, Mather and Siluer mountaine, of each halfe an ounce, Fene∣gréeke, Turkish beanes and Céeres, of each one quarter of an ounce, séeth them all together in eight ounces of water euen to the halfe, then straine it through, and temper in thrée ounces of this decoction the Triphera aforesaid. The Phisitions therefore do occupie this Triphera with∣out Opium, because it is forcible and strong. Also they temper therewith otherwhiles one drag. of the iuice of Sauin, sometimes also Mirrha, red Storax, Bdellium, Euphorbium or Opopanacum, all according to the importance of the cause. Item, take Cassie wood thrée dragmes beaten very small, and giue it with wine. One that is more féeble: Take Myrrhe, Beuercod and red Storax, of each thrée dragmes, Sauine, fine and course Cinnamome, of each one dragme and a halfe, make an electuary there∣of with Hony, then take one quarter of an ounce thereof, and temper it in Wine for a potion. Item, take Saffron one dragme or more, and drinke it with Wine or with Mallowes water. Saffron onely preferreth the Floures; the same doth also one dragme of powned Cardamome. Here now do follow certaine powders which are to be taken in the potions, and amongst all things is nothing more to be commended then the Trociskes de Myrrha, which are thus prepared. Take Myrrhe one dragme and a halfe, Lupins two dragmes and a halfe, Rue, white water Mints, Candie Diptamus, Comin, Madder, Elecampane rootes, Sagapenum, Opopanacum, of each one dragme, then make Trociskes thereof with the iuice of Mugwort, and giue halfe an ounce thereof with water wherein Iuniper berries be decocted. Take Beuercod one dragme, powder of Mints halfe a scruple, drinke it with wine, it is also very good for this vse. Item, half a scruple of the blossomes of the Nut trée taken with wine doth the same. S. Iohns wort doth also moue much the termes.
Also these wines ensuing are very good for it, viz. wine of Elecampane rootes, of Marierom gentle, of the herbe Bennet, of Betony, of Gilloflowers, and of Rosemary. Item, take one hand∣full of Iuniper berries, Madder, Cinnamome and Myrrhe, of each halfe an ounce; séeth them al together in Mugwort water vntill the third part be euaporated, straine it, and put one dragme of Boreas vnto it, giue thereof a good warme draught twice or thrice a day. The same doth also the Trocisci Galliae Muscatae Rasis, foure scruples taken with warme white wine, it helpeth immediatly. It is here also to be noted, if so be that the patient might drinke no wine, then take the leaues of blew Flowerdeluce, stampe them and seeth them in capon broth, and let her drinke it: this is also found many times good, and it expelleth also dead children. Item, take the scull of a Capon before he is boyled or rosted, stampe it, and drinke it with Penniroyall water: this may suffice for the potions. Take Penniroyall, Italian Comin, Mints, Ireos, Hartwort, Mather and Myrrhe, of each one quarter of an ounce, make an electuary thereof with clarified Hony, take two dragmes of it, and drinke a draught of Béere or Wine after it, wherein Sauine, Penniroyall, Mugwort, Fen∣nell, rootes of Sperage, of Smallage and of Parsley haue bene decocted. Item, take of the electuary Antidotum Haemagogum halfe an ounce, and giue it fasting. If you had rather drinke it, then temper foure ounces of Mugwort water amongst it, and vse it against the time that the Flowers do come. Treacle and Mithridate do also force the Flowers very gently. Amongst the confections there be good for this the confected Elecampane rootes, the confected Eryngus, conserues of Pionie, and Myrrhe rosted in an apple. The Italian women do highly commend the electuary Diacyminum, if one do take euery morning one quarter of an ounce of it, then will the termes come within the space of a moneth as they affirme: it doth make fruitfull, and strengtheneth the stomacke. The confected Calmus is especial good, if the obstruction do come through celd. Fennel seed confected forceth also the flowers: likewise also Comin and Caruway: Cinnamom and Saffron are also to be vsed in all things. These pilles ensuing are also to be prepared: Take the pils Alephanginae halfe a dragme, Aloe two scruples, beaten Sauin one scruple, make fourtéene pils of it with the water of Mugwort, and take the one halfe thereof at once: they do moue the termes and the stooles, and are also very safe. Others. Take Muscus and Myrrhe, of each foure scruples, Stechas, Mather, Penniroyall, Citron pils, long pepper, Cassie wood, Cassie pils, Pionie séeds and Calmus, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Indie Spica halfe a dragme: make pils thereof with the iuice of Mugwort, whereof take 1. ʒ. at once. The ancient Phisitions do command pessaries to be vsed, as Euphorbium wrapt in wooll. Item, take Hellebore and the iuice of Wormewood, of each one quarter of an ounce, Ammoniacum one dragme, temper it with Oxe gall. But here ensue sundrie which are safer: Take Beuercod and Myrrhe, of each a like quantitie, Muscus a little, then forme it with the oile of Behen as an Acorne, and tie it to a thréed, and put it into the Matrix before. Or take fresh Rue, Wormewood and Coloquint, of each a like quantitie, forme a pessarie thereof of Oxe gall. Item, take white Watermints, Swines bread, Agnus Castus, Rue, Sauine, Mugwort, Penniroyall, Marierom, Radishes, Southernewood, Nettle seede, Iuniper leaues, Mather, white Hellebore, Centorie, Myrrhe, Beuercod, Elecampane roots, Sagapenum, Opopana∣cum, of each one dragme, Gallia Muscata one scruple, stampe all that is to be stamped, and then make a pessarie of it with the iuice of wild Cucumbers and Oxe gall, and vse them as before. Another. Take Gentian and Penniroyall, of each one quarter of an ounce, Nigella seeds one dragme, temper them together with powned figges, and with a little of the iuice of Mercury: these do make no heate like as the other. Item, take Gentian two scruples, Coloquint and Nigella séede, of each one dragme, temper them together with the iuice of wild Cucumbers. Or if you will haue it stronger, then put some white Hellebore vnto it: there be also sundry other made which be stronger and milder, accor∣ding to the importance of the cause of the foresaid cold and warme things, each according to his god pleasure and content. Amongst all these things, and all that may be iniected into the bodie and necke of the matrix or wombe, this general rule is to be obserued, that the same may be vsed as well before as after bathing.
Outwardly may one bathe and foment with all that which here ensueth: Take Asarabacca halfe a handful, Ebulus leaues one handful and a half, Feuerfew, Mints, Mugwort, Agrimony, Marierom and Betonie, of each one handfull, Cammomill, Melilot and Roses, of each halfe a handfull; cut all the herbes and séeth them, like as hath bene taught oftentimes. It is also very commodious and good to sit in warme water wherein Mallowes haue bene decocted. Or take Mugwort and Sauine, of each thrée handfuls, Mallowes, Hollihocke rootes and Bearefoote, of each one handfull, Fennell seeds, Parsley seedes, Annis, Dill séedes, Orage seedes, wild yellow Rape seedes, and Asarabacca, of each halfe a dragme, Cammomill, Elderne flowers, Rosemary, and Stechas, of each one dragme: make a little bag thereof, and séeth it in water, and then sit vpon it. Another. Take Mugwort, Sauine trée, of each thrée handfuls, swéet Costus roots, Mallowes, Hollihocke rootes and Bearefoote, of each two handfuls, the séed of Mallowes, of Hollihockes, of Southernwood, of Linséed, of Fenegréeke, of Cuscuta, mustard séede, of Lauender and of Sil∣uermountaine, of each one ounce and a halfe, Parsley séed, Fennell, Dill séed, wile yellow Rape seede, and Asarabacca, of each halfe an ounce, Cammomill, Elderne flowers, Stechas, Rosemary flowers, of each one ounce; séeth them as before, and then sit vpon the bag. For fomentation, you are to vse that which followeth hereafter: Take Cammomil, Mugwort, Sauine and Net∣tle roots, of each one handful, séeth them together in water, and receiue the vapor from beneath. Item, take Rue, Sage, Southernwood and Sauine, of each one handful, put them together into a new pot, and close it tight, but leaue a hole open aboue on the couer, wherein a tap may be put whilest it boyleth; afterwards draw out the tap, and receiue the warme vapor from beneath, as is sayd before. Or take Myrrhe as much as you will, temper it with the iuice of Mugwort, and let it drie; afterward put filed Harts horne vnto it, to wit, the third part as much as there is Myrrhe, then strew this pouder vpon a hot tile, and receiue the smoke beneath, but round about couer you close. You may also take for it Penniroyal, Rue, Sauine leaues, and vse them alone. Item, take Violet leaues two handfuls, Myrrhe halfe an ounce, let them séeth together in raine water, and foment therewith as warme as you can abide it. Take Penniroyal, Nep, Southern∣wood, Rue, Centory and Hyssope, of each one handfull, Sauine, Feuerfew, of each one handfull and a halfe, Cinnamom, Galingall, of each one dragme, Siluermountaine and Mather, of each halfe a handfull, Myrrhe one quarter of an ounce, beate them all grosse together, and séeth the same in a quart of water euen to the halfe, and then vse it as before: this also prouoketh vrine. Or take Penniroyall, Marierom, Sage and Mugwort, of each one handfull, séeth them all toge∣ther for a fomentation: for to fume, you are to take a little Coloquint, cast it vpon a hote stone, and receiue the fume from beneath; it greatly prouoketh womens termes: but note, that Colo∣quint is very sharpe, and that the sayd well sauouring spices and other things be much safer for to fumigate withall. Or take Dill, Cammomill, Melilot, Squinant, Cassie wood, Costus rootes, Sulphur, Rue, Marierom, Stechas, Southernwood, any of all these, or part of the same. To set boxing cups vpon the thighes is also very behouefull and auailable. Plaisters and Vnguents. TAke the muscilage of Fleawort and of Linséede, of each one ounce, vnsalted butter two ounces, Hens grease, Duckes grease, Goose grease, and the marrow of Calues bones, of each halfe an ounce, Ammoniacum one quarter of an ounce, oyle of Sesamum and oyle of swéete Almonds, of each fiue dragmes, Waxe as much as is néedfull for a salue; then annoint you therewith behind and before, from the nauell downewards, but not before that you haue vsed all other meanes of bathing, letting of blood, potions, &c. Item, take of the confection Bene∣dicta halfe an ounce, Turbith one quarter of an ounce, Nigella séed thrée dragmes, decocted Hony as much as sufficeth for to make a plaister. This is to be layd ouer the priuities as before. If so be that one perceiueth the termes after the vse of this foresaid meanes, some do aduise, and that very well, that this potion ensuing is to be made: Take Mugwort, Sene leaues, and Penniroyall, of each halfe a handful, Cinnamom halfe an ounce, Mace thrée dragmes; séeth it al together in thrée pints of good wine vntill about the fourth part be wasted, and this in a Canne stopt tight in séething water: this expelleth the termes vnto her due time. The other orderly meane for to preferre the termes, is, that first of all the Saphea or Median
shall be opened, and that afterwards a long bag is to be made, and to be filled with any of the foresaid herbes, which you like best, and then put vnto it one quarter of an ounce of Gallia Mus∣cata, and weare it so vpon the priuities. Afterwards make of one quarter of an ounce of the foresaid Gallia with the water of Mugwort nine pils, and take three thereof at once in the mor∣ning early, then make a pessary of the length of a finger, and fill the same with pouned Mercury, and put it into the place. Set boxing cups also vpon the thighes, and in the hams, and then rub the legs downewards with warme clothes. Squinant and Madder decocted also in the water of Maidenhaire and drunken, are also highly commended. Item, take the pipes of Cassie when the Cassie is taken out, and let them be well scraped on the outside, as many as you will, Cinnamom, Mace, Saffron, Diptamus and Baulme, of the one as much as of the other; make a powder thereof, and take a dragme thereof euery morning with water of Mints: the same moueth them very gently. But as much as concerneth letting of blood (whereof mention is made before) some do ad∣uise, and not without reason, if in case that a woman hath not had her Termes a long time, that her veine is to be opened besides her little toe, and the next day afterwards on the other foote. The words of Hippocrates and of his expounder Galen be true, that the letting of blood and hun∣ger do cause women with child to miscary, for that thereby (they say) will the nourishment of the child be withdrawne. Therefore good héede is to be taken in these things, for that many women haue this for a cu∣stome, whether they be fat, grosse, strong, or leane, that they alwayes open a veine at the halfe of their going with child, like as we also haue before admonished in the first §. But if one will néeds be let blood, then must after the same (or else without letting of blood) bathings be oftentimes vsed, for which is Penniroyall to be taken, field mints, Southernwood, Centorie and Hyssope, of each one handful, Sauine and Feuerfew, of each one dragme, Siluer-mountaine, Madder, of each one handfull, Myrrhe one quarter of an ounce; stampe and choppe them all small, and let them séeth in sufficient water: then make thereof a bath for the raines of the backe, or a fomenting for the bottome of the belly. The boxing cups, whereof wee haue also spoken before, draw the blood downewards: Like as doth also the strong binding of the legges. The third meane is as hereafter followeth: thrée houres after the rising of the Sunne shall the Saphea of them be opened on the right foote which haue not the flowers, and about fiue oun∣ces of blood drawne. The next day after is this purgation following to be giuen; Take Agaricus, Turbith and Rubarbe, of each one dragme, Indy Spica, Ginger and Mace, of each sixe graines, Salgemmae one graine, Agrimonie, Mugwort, of each one ounce and a halfe; let them be stéeped foure houres: afterwards wring it through a cloth, and temper amongst it thrée dragmes of Benedicta Laxatiua, and then drinke it betimes in the morning. The third day afterwards you are to begin to vse this potion: Take Fennell rootes, Parsley rootes, Sperage rootes, the rootes of Butchers broome, and of Smallage, of each halfe an ounce: these being all cut smal together, then séeth them in a quart of well water vnto the halfe; afterwards swéeten the decoction with Sugar, and then drinke thereof fiue ounces, and so continue this the space of eight or ten dayes. In the meane time is the body to be kept open with gentle clisters, or else they are euery euening after supper to swallow a pill of Alephanginae or of Aloes. Afterwards it is very good, that thrée times in foure and twentie howers all the backe bone be annointed with this salue ensuing: Take the oile of wallflowers two ounces, oile of Saffron one ounce, the grease of Badgers and of Hens, of each halfe an ounce, Saffron, Indie Spica, Lignum Aloes, and Mugwort, of each halfe a scruple, Waxe as much as is néedfull for a salue. After the foresaid potions, are these pils fol∣lowing to be vsed: Take Pillulae foetidae two scruples, de Hiera composita one scruple, make seuen pils of it with the confection Benedicta. And if so be that through all this aduice the termes do not appeare, then are the tops of the thighes, hard by the priuities, to be bounden hard: but if that will not helpe, set immediatly hot cups behind on the calues of the legs, setting them vp and off. Lastly, then make this bath fol∣lowing: Take Penniroyall, white water mints, Marierom and Smallage, of each thrée hand∣fuls, Sauine sixe handfuls, Opopanacum, Myrrhe, of each halfe an ounce, Hartwort, Rue, of each
thrée handfuls; séeth them all together in sufficient water vntill about the halfe, but leaue the herbes in it, and then make a bath of it for the raines euen to the nauell, and sit therein the space of halfe an houre, or as long as you can. When you haue rested somewhat, then put some cotten (being dipped in the iuice of Mercury) vp into the place, and without doubt it will pro∣uoke the termes. Euery such woman is also to beware of all slimie meates, which is from all hard meate, like as all that is made of Dough, of Pease, of Beanes, of Chéese, of Milke, and all that is drest with them, from all salt, cold and binding things, and from thicke raw red Wine: but Cinnamom, Saffron, Ginger, and Smallage séedes and rootes, Annis, Fennell, Parsly séed, or any of all these is she to vse alwayes with her meate. But if so be that this retention of the termes be caused therof, for that a woman had but little blood, did great labour, were weake, leane, not long recouered from a long lingring sicknesse, or had liued a long time in hatred, malice, great sorrow, and such like; then is such to haue those meates which nourish much, and she shall omit all hatred, sorrow, and such like. She is to bathe oftentimes in water, to sléepe much, to take rest, and to be merrie. She must also re∣fraine from letting of blood, except it be a very little. But she is to vse Pistacies, Pingles, Al∣monds, and other nutritiue things as is before said. And although it appeared that her termes must be alwayes quickened through Phisicke, yet it must be begun with the mildest meanes, like as hath bene counselled before. How that the excessiue course of the Flowers is to be stopt. §. 3. WHen this course of womens termes getteth the mastery, then be there very hea∣uie sicknesses to be feared, to wit, the dropsie, the consumption, Hectica, the paine of the backe, the paine of the stomacke, feeblenesse of naturall digestion, lacke of appetite, and such like diseases moe. This issue is commonly caused of outward or inward occasions: the outward may be fals, blowes, thrusts, great running, leaping, dauncing, walking in great heate, and such like, all which maketh the blood subtile and fluxible. Item, if there breake a veine open in the matrix or wombe, through vnnaturall and vntimely birth, through any vlcers, or through any other brusings in the neck of the wombe, through long vse of many hot spices, or of any subtile meate and drinke. The inward causes may be the strength of the expulsiue, or the debilitie of the retentiue vertue. This may also be caused of some disease of the Matrix, and through the moisture of the same. But concerning the part it selfe, the same may be too féeble, too slippery, too wide, and too much o∣pen: yet in case the moisture of this part be caused of it, then is the fluxe of blood so great, that the Matrix and the parts adiacent cannot containe the humors, or these humors be so sharpe, so subtile, so hote, so venemous, so salt, so biting, so cold, or so waterish, that the same cannot be re∣tained. The outward causes may be enquired of the patient her selfe. But if this disease be caused of the debilitie of the retentiue vertue, then is the woman bleake or pale of colour, and weake. The signes of the same part be when as it waxeth leane, and con∣sumeth: each humor may be adiudged out of the propertie of the body, like as we haue taught the same elsewhere, as heate, of the fulnesse of the veines, thirst, itch, ilfauoured or lothsome co∣lour of the face and of the whole bodie. If then such procéede out of blood, then doth the colour of her termes alter, and will be whi∣tish; or if the same procéede of Cholera, then are the flowers somewhat yellowish, and if of Me∣lancholia, then darkish, blew or black. By the foresaid colours one may easily come vnto the full knowledge what humors might be the only cause of this excessiue moisture, whereby may be knowne how to choose of these remedies following, wherwith the excessiue course of the termes may be stayed. But first of all there be for this purpose certaine rules to be noted. First, you must neuer bathe for this excessiue course of the termes, neither yet vse any kind of things which bringeth heate with it. Secondly, when this kind of issue commeth by reason of the fulnesse of the bodie, as it were an vnburthening and cleansing of the same, then is it by no meanes to be stayed, if thereby be not feared a great debilitie. Thirdly, if so be that women be full of blood, and this
fluxe come too abundantly, then is the Basilica veine to be opened, thereby to withdraw the blood. Fourthly, in case that it be perceiued that red Cholera, or any other mixed moistured were cause of this fluxe, then is the same moisture or humor to be purged with appropriate medicines, yet mingling alwaies amongst it some binding and comforting things. Fiftly, iniection is also very needfull for this disease, or some such like instruments to be vsed, whereby the medicine might be brought into the womb. Sixtly, if any astringent things may be brought into it through any instruments, then may they help much better and a great deale sooner than those things that be giuen by the mouth. Seuenthly, because that with this menstrual fluxe, not onely the vertue di∣gestiue, but also the whole bodie is weakened, therfore are they to be sustained with light meate, as with yolkes of egges, with yong flesh, and broth of the same, and such like. Sometimes also with water wherein the seed of Butchers broome is decocted or tempered with water of Sorrel. Eightly, it is also good to set great boxing cups vnder the breasts vnpickt. Ninthly, this fluxe of the termes is not to be stopt so long as one seeth that the woman hath her liuely colour, and doth remaine strong and healthie: but as soone as one perceiueth that her strength fadeth away, then be all meanes to be sought for to stop it. Tenthly, if one desire to purge any of the foure hu∣mors, and to separate it from the cleane bloud, then may that best be effected by vomits, for that thereby the matter is deriued to another place, and stay their course that they fall not downe∣wards. Eleuenthly, these women are to abstaine from all heauie labour, and from all that ma∣keth the blood fluxible and thinne. By all these forementioned propositions may be clearely séene and marked, that if any desire to cure or remedy this disease, that these women must leade an easie life, and kéepe themselues quiet. They must also liue in such a place where it is not too hote nor too cold. They must also eschue all thinne and waterish meates, viz. from fruite, except all that which bindeth: in like manner also from all meate which cause any kind of heate. But all kinds of rosted fowles, and all that maketh grosse blood, as Rice, Wheate and Lentils be good for them. They must also be∣ware of ouercharging them with meate or drinke, whereof the causes be declared in the seuenth rule, and afterward to put in practise these remedies following, according to the importance of the cause. Thus for to speake first of the things which inwardly are to be vsed, hath bene spoken of before, and also what order of diet, or gouernement of life is to be obserued. But in case that any do desire any ampler declaration of it, then let him looke the seuenteenth Chapter and 17. §. where is spoken of the red or bloudie flixe, which also is most méete for this vse. But for this menstruall fluxe, may this Confection following be vsed: Take the Species Triasantali and Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each one dragme, prepared fine Bolus two scruples, Bloodstone washed in Plantaine water, and make tabulats thereof. Or vse this powder following: Take Species Triasantali one dragme and a halfe, Diarrhodon Abbatis one dragme, De Gemmis Frigidis one dragme and a halfe, prepared Coriander two scruples and a halfe, washed Bloodstone one dragme, prepared Bolus halfe a dragme, Shepheards purse two scruples, Roses, Corall, of each halfe a dragme, Cinnamome one quarter of an ounce, Sugar as much as you please, then make a powder of it. Item, take prepared Bolus one dragme, sealed earth two scruples, Tormentil half a dragme, Bursa Pastoris one scruple, Species de gemmis frigidis one dragme and a halfe, prepared Pearles one dragme, Rubins, Pomegranates, Smaragdes, Iacints, Saphirs, of each halfe a scruple, Roses, red Corall, Saunders, of each one scruple, Sugar thrée ounces; make a powder thereof, and vse it in broth, or strewed in meate. The confection of the refuse of iron is also very profita∣ble to be vsed for this disease, especially if so be that the lesser remedies will not helpe. Another. Take conserue of Roses two ounces, Bloodstone, Trociscos de Carabe, de terra sigillata, and de Spodio, of each one dragme, make a powder thereof, and temper them well together; af∣terwards take euery time thereof about one dragme. Take conserue of Roses sixe ounces, con∣serue of Burrage, of Buglosse and of Baulme, of each one ounce, prepared Bolus one dragme, prepared Pearles one quarter of an ounce, of the fiue precious stones aboue mentioned, of each one scruple, Cinnamome one dragme, make an electuary thereof. Another. Take of the driest conserue of Roses thrée ounces, Marmalade two ounces and a halfe, red Corall one dragme, Bistorta, Trociscos de Carabe, and prepared Bolus, of each half a drag. prepared Bloodstone two dragmes, make an Electuarie thereof with the sirupes of Mirtles.
Item, take conserue of Roses thrée ounces, Marmalade two ounces and a halfe, conserues of Burrage and of Buglosse, of each one ounce, prepared Bolus one dragme and a halfe, prepared Pearles two dragmes and a half, Bistorta one dragme, Tormentill two scruples, red Saunders one dragme, then temper them all together with the sirupe of Mirtles vnto a confection. The blacke confected Cherries are very good for this vse: in like manner also the preserued Barberries. Item, hold a roote of Galingall long in your mouth, and chew the same small. It is is also a common aduice which is not to be despised, that tosted bread should be steeped with red Wine, and powned Nutmegs strewed vpon it and so eaten. Item, take fine Bolus which is well wa∣shed, Masticke, yellow Amber, prepared Coriander, and Dates, of each a like quantitie, then take thereof at each time halfe a dragme with a rere egge. This powder ensuing is also maruel∣lous good: Take prepared Bloodstone thrée dragmes, red Corall one dragme and a halfe, Tor∣mentill and Trociscos de Spodio, of each one dragme, shauen Iuorie, burnt Harts horne, of each two scruples, prepared Pearles one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus halfe a dragme; stampe all that may be stamped very small, and strew your meate therewith. Item, take powned Horstaile leaues one dragme, and bestrew your meate with it. You may also drink of this powder follow∣ing one dragme, lesse or more with the water of Plantain: Take of the first budded Harts horne, burne them in a potbakers ouen throughly to white chalke, and giue thereof one dragme or one dragme and a halfe with red wine or Plantaine water. You shall also find hereafter many sun∣drie powders and waters to drinke described: Take egshels whence yong chickens haue beene hatched, and Nutmegs, of each a like quantitie, temper them together, and drinke thereof the waight of a dragme with Vineger or Wine. The part within the Walnut taken a dragme thereof doth bind much. Another. Take Tormentill and Nutmegs, of each a like quantitie, Plantaine séeds halfe as much, powne them to powder, and giue it in the morning and euening with old Béere. Item, take Trociscos de Carabe one dragme, beate them to powder, and make a potion thereof with Plantaine water; this may be vsed the space of a whole wéeke together, for that they do calme and stay the fluxe: the like doth also red Corall one dragme with Plantaine water taken euery day alwayes before meales. Item, take burnt Harts horne and powned Nettle séede, of each a like quantitie, and take thereof the waight of one dragme with the water of Plantaine. The iuice of Yarrow doth bind also in this disease, if one take a spoonefull or twaine thereof. These iuices ensuing may be de∣cocted vnto the forme of a sirupe, for to be vsed in winter time: like as the iuice of broade Plan∣taine, the iuice of Shepheards purse, or Yarrow, &c. For this is also good the water of Elderne drunken, and Galingall chewed. Item, if a woman do flower too much, whether it be in childbirth or otherwise, and that it be feared that she might bléede to death, then take one dragme of red Nettle séede powned, and let her drinke it with Plantaine water. Some do giue chopt and boyled Poppie heads to drinke, but it is not alwayes conuenient: there be much safer things, viz. these ensuing. Take fine Bolus one quarter of an ounce, bind it in a cloth, hang it in a pot of wine, and then drinke thereof. Séeth Pimpernell in pease broth, and drinke also thereof. Or take dried Goates dung, stamp it to powder, and drinke thereof; it doth not only stay the menstruall fluxes in women, but also all kind of bléeding. For this also is very meete red Rose water drunken. Amongst clisters is this following very highly commended: Take Swines bred, Feuerfew, Baulme, Rue, Scabious, Rosemary flowers, Southernwood, Comin, Siluermountain, Ameos, Amomum, Balsam fruite, Cucubes, Bayberries, Calmus, Cassie wood, Cassia Fistula and pipes, of each one dragme and a halfe, Dill séed, Annis séedes, of each one handfull and a halfe, shauen Iuorie two handfuls: séeth them al together by a mild fire in two quarts of water vnto the half, and presse it out, take twelue ounces of this decoction, oile of Sesamum, of Rue, and of pepper, of each half an ounce, Indie salt one dragme, Diacastoreon, confection of Bayberries and Benedicta, of each thrée dragmes, temper them well together, and minister it very warme. With this fol∣lowing a woman is to be fumed from beneath: Take Aliptae Muscatae, Species Nerae, of each one dragme, Galliae Muscatae, and red Storax, of each thrée dragmes, Allume one dragme and a halfe.
Of this powder is a dragme to be vsed at once. This temperature is not easily to be made, be∣cause of the manifold simples which do come therein, and it is not only good for to stay the vn∣naturall fluxe of flowres, but is also good for the suffocation of the Matrix, for that it dryeth, and is good for a barren wombe, and especially if the maladie procéede of cold. Pessaries and such like: Stamp dryed Asse dung, and forme Pelsaries thereof with the iuice of Plantaine, and put it into the places. Another. Take iuice of knot grasse and washed Shéepes wooll, dip it therein, and lay it on the places. Item, take Frankinsence, Pomegranat blossomes, Gals, Antimonie, and the iuice of Sloes, of each a like quantitie, bestrew the wooll with it, and vse it as before. For this, is also good halfe a handfull of pouned Plantaine, and vse it as before: or make a small pessarie of the iuice of Sloes, and the iuice of Pimpernell with Cotton. Outwardly is this plaister ensuing to be vsed: Take the iuice of Plantaine 11. ounces, Rose water thrée ounces, Vineger halfe an ounce, red Corall, Amber, Bloudstone, fine Bolus, Mirtle séed, Akorne cups, and Frankinsence, of each one quarter of an ounce, sealed earth as much as is needfull for to make it thick inough: this being all beaten small and tempered to∣gither, then make two plaisters of it, and lay the one before, and the other behinde. The plaister ex Galbano may also be vsed, whereof heere do follow two sorts.Plaister of Galbanum. Take Galba∣num thrée ounces, Bdellium three quarters of an ounce, stamped Feuerfew halfe an ounce, and halfe a drag. Mirrhe halfe a dragme: melt the Gums in Vineger. But if they be not cleane, then wring them thorough a cloth, and let the Vineger séeth away, then make a plaister thereof with Turpentine. The other: Take Galbanum as much as you will, melt it by the fire in red wine, temper fine Bolus amongst it, and Dragon bloud, of each halfe as much as the waight of the Galbanum, then make a plaister with sufficient Waxe and Turpentine. Item, take pouned Lentils twelue ounces, Shepherds purse, and Plantaine, of each thrée handfuls, dryed Asses dung, and Goats dung, of each one ounce and a halfe, Frankinsence halfe an ounce, Dragon bloud, Mints, of each one ounce and a halfe, the iuice of Sloes, Hypocistis, Li∣cium, of each one ounce, fiue whites of egs, Beane meale thrée ounces, Gips foure ounces, but steepe the Gips the space of a day in Vineger, and then make a plaister thereof with the iuice of Plantaine, so that it may be sodden with the meale, vntill it be very thick. Lastly, mixe the rest amongst it, and when it hath stoode a good while, and is well tempered together, then take it from the fire, and stirre it continually about vntill it be thorow cold. This plaister is to be layd ouer all the priuities, and all the parts about it. The same plaister doth maruellously stop the bloud of the Piles, and all moysture of the Matrix of salt and tough humors, for that it is of∣tentimes approued. Item, take the iuice of Plantaine as much as you will, temper therein Trociscos de Carabe, and then apply them as all the rest. Or take Wormewood, Nightshade, and knotgrasse, of each a like much, stamp and wring the iuice out of it, then temper as much Rye meale amongst it, vntill it be as thicke as pap, af∣terwards lay it ouer the nauell, and ouer the priuities. Another: take Vineger dregs, make it hot, and wet a blew cloth in it, and lay it thrice double ouer the priuities. Before in the third part the tenth Chapter and 5. §. ye haue a pretious Salue, beginning, Take Comin, &c. which is also méete for this vse. There is also a Salue called De Gallia, which is thus to be prepared: Take Comin, Dill séed, Caruway, Rue séed, Amcos, Gallia Muscata, of each one drag. and a halfe, Epithimus one quarter of an ounce, Indy salt two scrup. white Rosin one ounce and a halfe, oyle of Dill two ounces, oyle of Roses one ounce, Aloe, Cloues, of each 2. scrup. molten waxe as much as is need∣full for to make a plaister of it, then lay it ouer the Kidneyes, and ouer the priuities: this salue doth not only stay the fluxe in women, but also expelleth the wind of the stomack, and hindereth parbraking. Or take Sandaraca one ounce and a halfe, pouned Cypers nuts one ounce, fine Bolus foure ounces, Plantaine seed, and Pimpernell rootes, of each two ounces and a halfe, Starch three ounces, then make it with water wherein Akornes were decocted, vnto a plaister or salue, and vse it as is sayd. There may also be made a bathe, as héere followeth: Seeth the rootes of Curcuma in sufficient water, and make thereof a bath for the raynes.
It is also good to make a bath wherein Allume is decocted, or any of these things following, which one will, as Mirtle séed, the rinds and rootes of the Elme trée, the rinds of the Oke tree, Pomegranat blossomes and the péeles, Akornes, Medlars, Lentils, and such like. Item, it is sayd that if one do burne Ranam Arboream to ashes, and the ashes worne on the neck, that womens termes will be stopt thereby, but it is to be proued. In like manner do some aduise, that the mosse of the blacke or Slo-thorne worne in ones shoes, should also stop the same. Item, take Shepherds purse, and binde it on the soales of a womans féete. Others aduise also that boxing cups should be set vnder her breast vnpickt, for that they draw the bloud vpwards, and it is also a very good remedie for to stop therewith the flowing of the termes. Likewise it helpeth also excéedingly to binde the armes hard, to the end that thereby the bloud might be drawne vpwards. Further, this setting of cups, binding, and all these things that are to be put into the places admonished before, be especially to be vsed, if it be perceiued that through such superfluous courses women be impotent, and were afraid of present falling into a swoune. In like manner also it is very requisite that she smell oftentimes to cold things, and vse other moe binding things, which be described in the first part, the eight Chapter, and the 7. §. For a conclusion it is to be noted, whether there be heate or cold in this woman, that the medicine may be ordained accordingly. These be all warming things, and they also which stop bloud, which do héere follow, viz. Frankinsence, Mastick, Cypers nuts, Sandaraca, Laudanum, Mirrha, Storax, Annis, and such like. Cold stopping things be these, as Camfer, the iuice of Sloes, burnt Iuorie, Coriander, Dra∣gon bloud, Saunders, bloud stone, Hypocistis, fine Bolus, Ruscus seed, Mirtle séed, Gals, Pom∣granat blossoms, the seed of Plantaine, the seed of Melon, of Cucumbers, of Gourds, of Pom∣peons, and Pimpernell rootes, &c. whereby all tempered medicines may be adiudged. Of the whites, or white fluxe in women. §. 4. THe disease which women do call the whites, and the Phisitions Menstrua alba, hath a great acquaintance or fellowship with the auoidance of humane séed, or the running of the raynes, whereof we haue written at large before in the sixt Chapter: and it is also very euidently declared, that such kind of fluxes be caused through hot, and through cold causes which is héere also to be noted. But aboue all that which is there discoursed do all famous Phisitions commend, that if it procéed of heate, women be first of all to be purged: for which, Cassie is passing good: after∣wards giue her euery other day one drag. of Trociscos de Carabe tempered in Plantaine water, or a quarter of an ounce of Triphera ex parte Phenonis tempered with a little fine Bolus. The raines are to be annointed with the salue of Roses, and with other things moe which be pre∣scribed in the spermaticall fluxe. There is also to be giuen her euerie second or third day one dragme of the filing of Iuorie to drinke with Plantaine water: and the cold loosings of Dia∣margariton is she also to vse oftentimes. Item: Take Camphora ten graines, bruse it small, beaten Amber one scruple: drinke them togither with Plantaine water, it is a very good medicine. For this is also estéemed to be a sure remedy, the first buds of the Blackberrie bush, and the berries thereof dried, pouned, & drunken euery day one dragme with red wine, or twise a day. There may also be made a confection of the said berries when they be ripe, seething the same with hony or Sugar, and to vse thereof daily. But in case that this disease procéede of cold, whereto some do make sixe kindes of bathes which are to be vsed one vpon the other, which me thinketh to be much too strong, for that they take Sulphure, Allum, stéeled water, and strong Menageges, as Feuerfew, Mugwoort, and bai∣berries: afterwards againe all things which be contrarie, as Oken buds, Knotgrasse, Squi∣nant, &c. Therefore will we leaue the same vnmentioned: but for this must be taken the flowers of dead Nettles poudered the waight of a dragme with wine. Confected Annis seed is also very commodious for this. But in case that the issue be very sharpe, then beate whites of egs with Rose water, and make clothes wet in it and put it vp into womens secrets.
Of the suffocation or ascension of the Matrix. §. 5. THis terrible sicknes is in many things most like to the falling euill Epilepsiae, and the great swouning Syncopi, because the Matrix hath great sympathie with the heart, the arteries, braines, and with the two membranes which do couer the braines. This maladie commeth to women through diuers causes, and especially when there is retention of their termes or flowers, yea also through the retention of their naturall seed, especially to them that be accustomed to haue the company of a man, and must then forbeare it, as widowes, and aged maidens: for that in case the foresaid séed be retained, then causeth it many kinds of winds in the Matrix which do compell it so to ascend, that otherwhiles it op∣presseth euen the Diaphragma. This is then the opinion of diuers learned men in this case: but Galen doth dispute against it with strong reasons, that the foresaid naturall séed doth much ra∣ther cause this sicknes, than the retention of the tearmes; chiefly in women which also are bur∣thened with many bad humours, be full of blood, and brought vp in idlenes, haue accustomed to accompany with a man (like as is expressed) and now suddenly are constrained to want it. Therefore is commonly séene, saith he, that this suffocation for the most part troubleth wi∣dowes. He maintaineth also and that by good reason, that the mother doth not ascend euen to the Diaphragma (which is the midriffe) and there doth abridge the breath. Thus may be caused through the retention and putrifaction of the seed, all manner of trou∣blesome accidents, as giddines and paines of the head, madnes, short breath, and panting of the hart, their natural colour doth alter into a yellow pale, yea somtimes into rednes of the face & of the eies, they gnash with their téeth, draw their hands & féet away, they do also feele that there ascendeth somewhat vpwards out of the belly, and commonly then do they presse downe their belly with their hands; they also do sit commonly with bent knees on the ground; they loose their speach: and neuertheles when one calleth them by their names, then do they heare it, but they cannot answere, and do lie oftentimes, that neither breath nor pulse, nor any life can be perceiued in them, yea are taken to be dead: and also sometimes they are so taken or assailed with these kinds of maladies that they depart out of this world: neuertheles they alwaies re∣taine their memorie and knowledge; and when they come againe to themselues, then do they rehearse all that is spoken and done. So that this disease (like as is rehearsed) is in many things to be compared with the falling sicknes, onely that they do not fome. In like maner it is not vnlike the palsey, but only that there is no long breath with it, and very like the sleeping sicknes Lethargo, but that there is no ague with it. Amongst all the foresaid signes is there no woorse than the retention of the breath, for that the same cannot be long holden vp without death follow after it; for that a body cannot liue without breath. This greeuous accident may also be caused through a strong cold, which doth so sore assaile a body, that thereby all his breath and pulse will be so drawne inward that by the feeling it can be at no hand perceiued, as we haue also admonished héere and there in the first part amongst the diseases of the braines. In fine, the meane to remedie this terrible disease consisteth in three seuerall things. The first what is to be done in the hastie accident for to hinder the stifeling. The second (if so be that this disease be caused through retention of the seed) what is to be vsed for it. The third, in case that this be caused through retention of the termes, or through any other had humours, how one is to behaue her selfe therein. When as this disease commeth with hin∣derance of the breath, then is spéedie help néedfull: therefore is cold well water, or Rose water to be cast by and by into her face, and to hold to the mouth and nose to the end it may compell the breath backward, and breake out with force: also the hands, féet, buttocks, and thighes, are to be rubbed hard with Vineger and salt, and afterwards to be bounden very hard. Ano∣ther woman must make her finger fat with odoriferous oyle (as oile of Lillies, or any other) and therewith annoint the necke of the wombe or Matrix, and rubbe the same softly to the end that the Matrix be thereby drawne downewards. Further, there is a little néesing powder to be blowen into the nose, to the end that through the strong motion of néesing the mother may be drawne downeward. They are also to be called hard and lowdlie by their names, and to
keepe away all pleasant sauours from their nose: but the places are to be fomented, annointed, or fumed with all odoriferous things. Also a great boxing cup is to be set vpon the same place vnpickt. You are also to hold all filthie lothsome sauours before the nose, as Assa foetida, Galba∣num, or Beuercod: also the smell of old clouts, of shooes burnt, of haire, of feathers, and such like that may be gotten speedily, are you to let her smell vnto. For that (like as we in the beginning of the description of the Matrix or mother haue admonished) the mother doth flie and auoid by nature all stinking things, and to the contrarie loueth all odoriferous fumes and sauours: yet are these stinking things not to be vsed but in extreme need: for that all that stinketh very lothsomely, doth also weaken and infeeble nature. Amongst these foresaid things is Hares haire also verie requisite. The chéefest odoriferous things which are to be vsed beneath is Mus∣cus and Ambra meete. And if one can get it suddenly this powder following is to be taken. Take red Storax, Lignum Aloes, and cloues, of each one dragme, Muske, Amber, of each halfe a dragme; make all to powder, then binde it in a cloth and put it vp into their places. Item: Take one ounce of the oyle of Lillies, Muscus, and Saffron, of each thrée graines; bruise them well togither and dip a taint in it, and put it into the place, or fill a small bag with salt and vse it as before. You are also to make a fume with these things following, and to receiue the same through an Ammell: Take Cassie wood, Cinnamom, Thyme, Gallia Muscata, and such like. But if these will not helpe, then vse one of the strong pessaries and others which be described before in this chapter and the 2. §. Verum (saluo pudore) praesentissimum Remedium est, si maritus vngat Penum cum Oleo Garyophyl∣lorum, admixto parùm Olei amygdalarum dulcium; ad caliditatem prioris temperandam, & cum vxore Cocat: Matrix enim subito descendet. When as now this patient beginneth to recouer againe (being a maiden) and enclined to this grieuous sicknes, then is there no better remedy, than that she induce her selfe into the state of matrimony: if not, then is she to refraine from all these things, which do increase naturall seed; as flesh, wine, and other, like as before is described in the sixt Chapter, and the 4. §. and the seuenth Chapter and the 8. §. For this is also letting of blood very méete, the vse of all coo∣ling meates, and the absence of men. All minerall bathes which do drie, be also very fit for this vse, and she may also vse therewith these confections following. Take fresh rootes of Polypody sixe ounces, Sene leaues, Violets, Prunes, Sebestes, sower Dates, and Currans, of each one ounce and a halfe; seeth them in two quarts of water vnto the halfe, afterwards wring it out: and whilest that the decoction is yet warme, steepe therein sixe ounces of the seeds of Fleawoort, so long that the muscilage may be drawen out of them, then put 24. ounces of white Sugar vnto it. Likewise also the pith of sower Dates and Cassie which are prepared with the foresaid decoction, of each three ounces: then seeth them againe togither by a milde fier vntill that it be thick, and temper with it these things following beaten very small, burnt Iuorie, Rubarbe, red and white Saunders, Roses, Violets, white Poppy seed, Purslain séed Endiue séed, Lettice seed, small Endiue séed, of Fennell, Dragagant, Starch, scra∣ped Iuory, Gum, Hollihockes, Fumitory, Licorice, and Annis seeds, of each a dragme and a halfe, Diagridion two dragmes and a halfe, Mirobalani Indi, Emblici, of each thrée dragmes: tem∣per them all togither in a mortar, and giue from halfe an ounce vnto seuen drag. This foresaid electuary is so highly commended, that it is called the gift of God. These are also not euery day, but only once or twice to be vsed, with a decoction of Mugwort and Sugar, and then to fast sixe howers vpon it. This being done, there shall a round plaister be layd vpon the nauell De Galbano, and not to take it off, before it fall away of it selfe, whereof there be two diuers sorts discouered before in the 3. §. Lastly, these pils ensuing are to be vsed: Take Siluermountaine, Madder, Penni∣royal, the innermost rindes of Cassie pipes, Pomegranate kernels, Pyony rootes, and Calmus, of each three dragmes, Muscus, and Spica of Indie, of each halfe a dragme: then make pils thereof with the iuice of Mugwoort, of them is she to take euery day, or at leastwise about the other day, if she do not vse the Confection, and that before supper. But the same is not to be giuen if the termes be present, but when they be past, if you will haue them milder, then put one drag. and a halfe of Aloes vnto them. But in case that this ascension of the Mother be caused through the obstruction of the termes,
and that a woman be come to her selfe againe, and that it is feared that it will returne againe, by reason that the cause is not yet taken away, & that it be certaine that this disease were caused through the retention of the termes, or of the naturall seed; then must diligence be vsed that the termes be preferred and moued, whereof we haue before giuen a full instruction. Item, if this suffocation of the Matrix procéed through obstruction or hinderance of the termes, then giue her one quarter of an ounce of powdred Agaricus with Wine or with Hony water, for it is a sure meane for it. It is also very good for the same, that there be taken one dragme of the powned Agnus Castus with one ounce of the hony of Roses, especially if the disease do come through the detention of the seed: the Trocisci de Myrrha do also moue much. Secondly, the Saphea is also to be opened in the foote, and afterwards one dragme of pow∣ned Betonie with the water of Feuerfew. In like manner also boxing cups are to be set vpon the thighes picked or vnpicked. Cut a peece of bread round like to a Dollor, and set thrée waxe candles in it of the length of a finger, set them so burning vpon the nauell, and then whelme ouer it a glasse of a quarterne long, then do the candles go out, and the glasse doth draw the Mother or Matrix perforce into her due and wonted place: and this hath béene oftentimes approoued. Item, annoint all the belly with oile of Masticke, and make a pot lid warme, wind it about with clothes, and hold it warme to the belly. Item, take Beuercod and Assa foetida, of each one quarter of an ounce, Philonium Romanum, one dragme; temper them together, and giue it fasting, then drinke vpon it a good draught of Muscadell or Malmsey, it helpeth maruellous well. The same vertue hath Triphera magna, the waight of a dragme and a halfe drunken with wine in the morning early. Likewise is also good for this one dragme of powned Pionie seeds drunken with Hony water. If the Matrix or Mother begin to ascend, then is to be taken one quarter of an ounce of yellow Rape séed with the water of Mugwort. For a plaister, you are to take Galbanum one dragme and a halfe, Bdellium one dragme, Mugwort, Feuerfew, of each halfe an ounce, oyle of Lillies one ounce; dissolue the gummes in the oyle, and when they begin to be cold, then temper the powder amongst it: with this salue they are to annoint them beneath and aboue the nauell, and then to lay a plaister of Galbanum vpon it. Item, take Assa foetida one ounce, Galbanum two ounces, melt them in vineger, and spread them warme vpon a leather of a quarter long, then lay them ouer the nauell: the Galbanum is also good vsed alone. Whensoeuer you will lay any thing vpon the place of the paine, then take the rootes of Louage, cut them very small and put them in a bag. Cometh the paine of the Mother through cold? then seeth it in Wine; but if it be through heate, then séeth them it water, and lay it on the place of the paine. Could you not get these rootes? then take Acorne buds, it is also good. Néesing and parbraking is much aduised for this, but especially héede must be taken to the strength of the patient. And in case that the same woman must liue without a man, then is she so much the oftener to vse annointing with the odoriferous salues with the fingers beneath, and vse therewith all things which do diminish naturall seede, as Rue, Agnus Castus, and such like, as elsewhere hath bene shewed. Besides all these, you may looke all that hath bene said before in the se∣cond §. of the termes in women. Of the descension and falling downe of the Mother or Wombe. §. 6. LIke as the Wombe or Mother in women ascendeth, so doth it also descend, so that it commeth so low, that she being turned about, it dependeth, and with a long end hangeth out of the bodie, like as is wont to happen with the Arsegut, wherof we haue written in the tenth Chapter and the second §. The causes of this disease may be outward and inward: the outward may come of fals, heauy birth, long sitting vpon a cold stone, or in the water, through hard going to stoole,
through strong néesing, through running, leaping, through vse of much cold salue, and such like. The inward be when the bodie is pestered and full of humors, which afterwards do fall euen to the wombe, which do so vnknit and dissolue the bands and stayes of the same, that they can∣not hold the mother any longer; like as oftentimes befalleth in the palsie and falling sicknesse, also in vlcers and impostumes of the wombe. The signes of this disease be manifest, if the same be caused through any outward causes, the same may be inquired of the patient her self. Other∣wise it is to be considered whether the woman be fat, moist, liue in quiet, is wont to eate much fruite, or much fish, &c. They haue also oftentimes paine about the priuie members, and in the neather part of the backbone. There commeth also sometimes an Ague with it, retention of the vrine, and hardning of the stoole. Some get also much trembling, the crampe, and great feare, without any manifest causes, with many moe grieuous accidents. Now in case that the descen∣sion of the Mother do yet remaine somewhat inwardly, then must a Midwife behold and search her: to wit, then she must put one finger into the necke of the wombe or Matrix: if the passage be smooth and open, then is the Mother not falne downe; but if she find therein any stop or let, then it is a sure signe that it is descended: and if so be that the Matrix or Mother continue long out of her natural place, then is if vnpossible that she should be reduced againe into her due and naturall place, and more vnpossible if the same depend out of the body. Thus for to remedie this disease, then may one choose out of these things following those which are thought to be best and most méete, according to the qualitie of the disease. First of all take thrée boxing cups, and set the one vpon the nauell or vnder the breasts, and the other two aboue the priuities vnpickt: these may draw the Matrix againe into her accustomed place. The Midwife may also annoint the bodie within with oyle of Masticke, and do whatsoeuer is pos∣sible by manuall operation to set the same againe into her naturall place. Secondly, take a glowing brick, and strew thereon this powder following: Take Tormentil, the iuice of Sloes, and Bistorta, of each thrée dragmes, the péeles and blossoms of Pomegranats, of each one quarter of an ounce, Assa foetida one ounce, Mastick, Frankinsence, Galbanum, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Cipers nuts, Gals, Mirtle séed, of each fiue dragmes; stampe them to∣gether, and mixe them well together: this fume is she to receiue from beneath, but héed must be had that it come not into the nose: for to hold to her nose, serue none other but well sauouring and sweete smelling things, Ambra, Muscus, and Violets, and all sauours which are most accep∣table vnto her. These bad sauours (as is said before) cause the Mother to ascend againe. This same is also to be vsed whilest that the boxing cups are fastened. Item, take a stinking egge from a brood hen, and dip cotten in it, and then lay it vpon the de∣pendant necke of the Matrix, then will it forthwith be drawne vp againe. Or take Cammomil, Marierom and Caruway, of each one handful, Linséed one handful and a halfe; seeth it in water, and receiue the vapor thereof. If so be that there be heate with it, then are you to vse this vapor following: Take Housléeke as much as you please, beate it grosse, and afterwards lay it vpon a hote stone, and let the wo∣man receiue the vapor thereof. Thirdly, then is this fomentation to be made: Take thrée ounces of Roses, Mirtle séed, Vio∣let leaues, Marigolds and Feuerfew, of each one handful, Assa foetida fiue dragmes; breake them all together, then put them in a bag and seeth them in red wine, and lay it after the vapor recei∣ued vpon the foresaid place. Or take the blossomes and pils of Pomegranates, Cipers nuts, the rinds of Medlars and of the Seruice trée, of each one ounce, Allume one ounce and a halfe, seeth them all together in red wine, and foment therewith the places and the parts adiacent of the Matrix. Some do also ad∣uise to take Oxe dung tempered with red wine, and to receiue the vapor of it from beneath. Fourthly, let euery day the necke of the Mother and al parts about the Mother be annointed with the salue Althea, but temper amongst it some marrow of any beasts, the fat of fowles, and oyle as much as you please: do this in the euening when she goeth to bed. You may also of such like things make a plaister, and apply it all the whole night as before. Or take the oyle of Mirtles, of Lillies, and of Masticke, of each two ounces and a halfe, Assa foetida, Bistorta, and Tormentill, of each thrée dragmes: the gum is to be molten, then powne all that is to be powned, and make a salue thereof, annoint therewith the body outwardly, and also vpon the kidneyes.
Lesser. Take the yolkes of two well brayed egges, put vnto them one ounce and a halfe of the oyle of Roses, fresh butter halfe an ounce, make a salue thereof, and vse it as before. The dependant Matrix is to be washed often with wine which is stéeled. Also the oyle of swéete Almonds may be vsed for this purpose. Fiftly: Take Assa foetida one ounce, Masticke, Frankinsence, Mirtle séede, Galingall, and Ci∣pers nuts, of each one dragme, stamped together very small, mixe it with the oyle of Mirtles, and annoint therewith a pessarie, afterwards put it into the places. Sixtly: Take Rosin two ounces, Frankinsence, Masticke, and Cypers gum, of each halfe an ounce, temper it together, and let it melt; make it then with the oyle of Masticke to a plaister, and weare it vpon the priuities: it will stay and let that the Mother or Matrix cannot fall any further out of the body. Or take Masticke one ounce, Frankinsence halfe a dragme, Cipers nuts, Galles and Mirtle seede, of each one dragme, pilles and blossomes of Pomegranates, and Turpentine, of each one quarter of an ounce; powne all that is to be powned, and temper it all together with Turpentine and oyle of Masticke, as much as will suffice for to make a mild plaister, spread it on a cloth of a quarter long, and halfe a quarter broade, weare this plaister con∣tinually betweene the nauell and the priuities. The common people do much commend to sit vpon Oaken boords, and to receiue the fume of dried Caruway from beneath: cakes baked with the dried séeds of Verbascum, and to eate them: to eate Annis seeds: to annoint the dependant Matrix oftentimes with the iuice of Sloes; and aboue all, vomiting and parbraking, thereby to draw the Matrix vpwards, are very good. Aboue all these which be before discouered against the descension of the Matrix, are these things ensuing also very good: Take burnt Date stones beaten small, and strew of this powder vpon the dependant member. A stronger. Take Mumia, Licium, Hypocistis, powned Galles, of each two scruples, burnt and small beaten Oyster shels two dragmes and a halfe, then make a powder thereof, and vse it as is before said. Item, take a wax candle of the length of sixe fingers breadth, and one finger thick, annoint it with oyle of Lillies and put it vp into the place. Item, take Cipers nuts, vnwormeaten Oken leaues, Squinant and Cammomill, of each halfe an ounce, Roses one quarter of an ounce, Hares haire cut small, halfe a dragme: stamp all to powder, and put it in a bag of the length and breadth of a finger, then stéepe it in warme wine wherein Cammomill hath bene decocted, and so put it vp into the body. This woman is also to sit vp to the nauell in a bath, wherein Allume and other astringent things haue bene decocted, and let her sit therein about an houre. Other do counsel to vse this bag following: Take Oken buds, Medlar leaues, Seruice leaues, the vppermost sprigs of Ladies thistles, Cipers leaues, of each one handfull, the sprigs of Mir∣tles, Valerian, wild mints, of each two handfuls, chop them all smal, afterwards put them into a bag, let it séeth well, and sit thereon when you are in the bath. For a conclusion, there serueth for this intent all that is prescribed before in the tenth chapter and second §. of the falling out of the Arsegut, for that both these diseases haue one kind of cause. Likewise also there are many things specified in the third part, the third chapter, & second §. of the tumerous breasts, which are méet for this purpose, like as also hereafter of women in child∣bed shall be said. So much be then spoken of this suffocation and descension of the mother: now we will pro∣ceede of other accidents which also concerne the Matrix or mother. Of the paine in the Mother or Matrix through wind. §. 7. FIrst of al each one may be wel assured which hath any vnderstanding, that eue∣ry vnnaturall accident which this part in women, to wit, the Matrix (whether it be of outward or inward causes) is subiect to, cannot be without paine, which the Grecians do call Hysteralgian. Amongst these, the causes be most windes, which cause no lesse paine in that place then they do in the guts, whereof we wil at this present write and discourse. The causes of this may be blowes, thrusts and falles. Item outward cold, which causeth an obstruction in the necke of the mother, whereby the winds be detained. These winds be also
caused sometimes through hard and painefull bearings, or through the long vse of windie meates, as Rapes, Chestnuts, Rie bread, and such like. The signes of these winds be paine in the matrix, and other parts adiacent, swelling vp of the belly, and that the paine is now here now there. To remedy this disease, some famous Phisitions do aduise that the body is first to be purged through some common clisters, through Cassie, or through the powder of Hiera picra; and that afterwards one quarter of an ounce of Triphera magna shall be taken in the morning with good wine, for the same is estéemed especiall good. These winds be also caused oftentimes through vomiting and parbraking. Secondly, take for it two ounces and a halfe of Oxymel, and thrée ounces of the water of Cam∣momill, afterwards set a common clister. Thirdly, foment the belly with wine wherein Cammomill is decocted. Lastly may Triphera or Philonium be vsed. This foresaid Philonium is very good, but (as is oftentimes admonished) men must deale pro∣uidently in it, for the Triphera is much safer. Afterwards do the famous Phisitions commaund to procéede with these things which do follow. Take Turbith one dragme or foure scruples, according as the woman is strong, Ginger one scruple, giue it her with water of Mugwort, or with common well water, wherein Mugwort is decocted: this a very excellent medicine for to asswage all paines of the matrix. If so be that one peraduenture feare any mischance, because the winds of the matrix do oftentimes cause it then take Caruway séede which is stéeped in Vineger, and dried againe and powdred, one dragme, Ameos, Ginger, Beuercod, of each one scruple, temper them together, and giue one dragme thereof with wine certaine dayes together. Or take Gentian the waight of one dragme with wine, which easeth them maruellous much, for that it expelleth not only the paine, but also preuenteth that there returne no paine vnto it. In the twelfth chapter and 11. §. you haue a potion with Gentian and others, which may also be vsed for this with great aduancement. Amongst the remedies which may be outwardly vsed, first is bathing good, whereto this fol∣lowing is to be prepared: Take Marierom, field mints, Southernwood, Fennell, and such like things which expell wind, seeth these in water for a bath. Or if so be that bathing is not méete, then vse fomenting of warme wine, wherein Cammo∣mill is decocted, and afterwards annoint the belly will the oyle of Elderne. Item, take oyle of Mastick one ounce, melt therein one quarter of an ounce of Laudanum and annoint you there∣with, yet the oyle of Lillies and of Wallflowers passeth all. Item, rere sodden egges brayed well with swéete milke, and some Saffron tempered amon∣gest it, and then layd vpon it, are highly commended for this vse. It is also sayd, that if blacke Hellebore be layd beneath before the Matrix, then doth it draw all moisture vnto it. But the Phisitions do séeth Hellebore, and make a cloth wet in the same decoction; this cleanseth the Matrix from all wind, without any molestation. This plaister following is especially commen∣ded for all winds and swellings of the Matrix: Take Bdellium and Ammoniacum, of each two ounces, Agnus Castus, Centorie, Southernwood, Marierom, field mints, Ameos, and Cassie wood, of each one dragme and a halfe, Turpentine as much as is needfull for to make thereof two plaisters, then lay one before and the other behind. Of the paine in the Mother through cold. §. 8. TAke Doronicum, Zeduary rootes, the séedes of Smallage and Cinnamome, of each one quarter of an ounce, Frankinsence halfe a dragme, Beuercod one dragme, white Sugar one ounce, temper them and stampe them all together, and giue thereof a spoonfull with wine. In the first part and the twelfth chapter there is a remedie for the memorie, to wit, of a grosser powder, which is also maruellous good to warme and strengthen the cold Matrix. Item, take one dragme of Treacle, Saffron foure graines, temper them in two ounces of Mugwort water, and then drinke it fasting, and fast thrée houres vpon it. Mithridate is also very good for all
diseases of the Matrix, and chiefly for them that procéede of cold. There is more good for this, Beuercod about the waight of a dragme tempered with oyle of Cammomill, and the belly an∣nointed with it. Ripe Iuniper berries eaten be also very good for this disease. The first Balsam (which is described in the eight part) is also especially good for the same, al plaisters, oiles, salues, and fomentations, which be described in moe other places, may be also vsed for this. The simple things which be méete for a cold Matrix, be these, to wit, Mugwort, Rue, Sage, Sauine tree, Assa foetida, Madder, Iuniper, Penniroyall, field mints, white water mints, Cal∣mus, Serapinum, and all that warmeth the kidneyes. Of the paine in the Mother through heate. §. 9. THere cometh also otherwhiles a great paine in the Matrix through heate, so that there must oftentimes things be vsed which take away and dead the sences, like as the iniection of Henbane seed or Poppy séed, but it must be prouidently taken in hand, and not to vse the same but in great heate. But if you will any thing that is more weaker, then séeth the Poppy heads in water, and iniect the decoction therof, and foment it therewith on the outside. Warme swéet milk iniected also is good for this purpose. Of the contraction of the Mother, or the necke of the same. §. 10. IT chaunceth also sometimes that the necke of the Mother is closed cleane vp, waxeth narrow, and shrinketh vp. And for to mollifie or soften the same, take Hollihocke rootes as many as you please, séeth them in Swines grease or in Tur∣pentine, to the end it be a soft plaister; then dip a clout in it, and put it vp into the necke of the Matrix. The same doth also the water wherein Hollihocke rootes be decocted. In like sort also the oyle of white Narcissus. Of the Schirrus, or hardnesse of the Mother. §. 11. OVt of these forementioned accidents of the Matrix, whether it be through heate or cold, cannot these parts be hardened any way, but as the Spléene is hard∣ned: for which these meanes ensuing be very good: Take Aloe one ounce, Masticke one quarter of an ounce, Galbanum dissolued in Vineger one ounce; and being strained, temper the rest amongst it, and then make it with oyle of Cammomill and Waxe into a méetly hard plaister. The plaister of Melilot is also good for this vse. Item, séeth Figges and Fenegréeke as much as you please in Barley water, and make thereof a Semicupe. This foresayd bath is good both for the paine and the heate also. There may also be vsed all that is before admonished in the sixtéenth Chapter and first §. These herbes following do cary all other medicines towards the Matrix; as Penniroyall, Rosemary, Sa∣uine trée, Iuniper, Rue, Beuercod, Yarrow, Cinquefoyle, Myrrha, Sage, Madder and Lupins. But because that all these foresaid things do also leade all things towards the Bladder and the Kidneyes, so do they the same also to the Matrix. Of the Impostume in the Mother, or in the necke of the same. §. 12. IF so be that these foresaid diseases, as the retention of the termes of natural séed, or any other sharpe humor, whether it be blood, Cholera, Phlegma, or Melan∣cholia winds, or any other cold moisture, the which falleth downe to the Matrix, then may they soone cause an impostume: notwithstanding the same can pro∣céed well of any outward causes, as of blowes, falles, leachery, through a mis∣chance, through the ignorant dealing of the Midwife, and such like things moe, the which do bring with them either heate or cold. The signes of a hote impostume, be Agues,
great paine betwéene the nauell and the priuities, and round about the raines, much watching, vnquietnes, and paine in making water and going to stoole, swift pulse, paine of the head and of the eyes, heauy breath, paine of the stomacke with much parbraking. These impostumes will be very hardly cured, and the harder if they are situated déepe in the Matrix: but generally they are to be cured like as the impostumes and vlcers of the raines are taught to be healed, viz. as in the sixtéenth chapter and 6. 7. 8. 9. §. hath bene shewed. But here be first certaine rules to be noted, whereof the first is, that one must endeuour to cary away the matter from thence which descendeth thitherwards. Secondly, the Liuer veine is to be opened, and afterwards the veine in bending the knée, or if one can neither see nor find it, then is the Saphea to be taken. Thirdly, if so be that this impostumation be in the Matrix, or in the necke of the same, then be the termes in no wise to be moued, but onely (like as is sayd) to withdraw the matter into another place. Fourthly, after the letting of bloud is the patient to bo purged. Fiftly, vomiting and parbraking is very commodious. Sixtly, if it be possible she is to refraine the space of thrée dayes from eating and drinking, or at least keepe her selfe very sparingly, and especially in drinking. Seuenthly, she must watch as much as is possible. Eightly, after that the bodie is wel purged, then is the Matrix in the beginning of the sicknesse to be delayed with such kinds of plaisters as deriue the matter from that place. Ninthly, a∣mongst these foresaid remedies, temper alwayes somewhat which may asswage the paine. Tenthly, in the declination of the disease are those things good which do ripen and mollifie the matter vntill it issue and breake out. Eleuenthly, if so be that this impostume would not be ma∣turated and brought to matter, then is the same to be effected with Fenegréeke, with Hollihocke rootes, with Cammomill, with Wheate flower, with Pigeon dung, and with some Saffron be∣ing made to a plaister and layd thereupon. Twelftly, the astringent remedies are not to be long vsed, to the end the impostumes be not hardned: according to all these foresaid rules, euery one may know how to order her selfe in the curing of this disease. If this impostume do come through heate, then is héede first to be taken whether the sicke person be bound in her bodie; if it be so, then are mild clisters to be set, or Suppositories, and afterwards to open a veine, as hath bene shewed in the second rule. She is also to be fed with Barley paps, stued Spinage, and such like things: and to prepare the matter, giue vnto her the iulep or sirupe of Violets at certaine times to drinke, and afterwards purge her with Cassie, sower Dates or Manna, and also moue her otherwhiles to vomit. Afterwards vnto the raines, the kidneyes and the hips, are cooling salues, plaisters, and such like things to be applied, and so to coole them as much as is possible; for which you are to vse this salue following: Take Dra∣gagant and Gum, of each one ounce, dissolue them in wine, and temper therewith washed Ce∣ruse, the Litharge of Gold, Starch, Dragon blood, fine Bolus, and Roses, of each one dragme, burnt Copper two scruples, oyle of Roses and Waxe, as much as sufficeth for to make a salue therewith: but if so be that one cannot apply the same to the maladie, then seeth them all toge∣ther with milke (except the Waxe) and then dip a cloth therein or a sponge, and lay it vpon the disease. If you had rather haue somewhat else, then take the muscilage of Fleawort alone, or temper it with oile of Roses, with broad Plantaine water, with the water of Nightshade, and with the white of an Egge. There may also a great tent of Cotton be made, and the same dipt in this receipt following, and put into the necke of the Matrix. Take Waxe and oyle of Violets, of each halfe an ounce, let all melt together, and whilst that it is yet warme, put thereto the iuice of Plantaine, of Night∣shade, of each one ounce, Camfer halfe a dragme, then temper them well together in a morter, and vse it as is aforesaid. If so be that there be any great paine with it, then vse oyle of Roses brayed with the white of an egge, and tempered with hens grease: but if the paine will not as∣swage and cease therewith, then is the veine in the ham to be opened, and with the foresaid de∣coction Poppie séed is to be tempered. In like maner Sief Album is to be tempered with womans milke which giueth sucke to a daughter or maiden child, and to be iniected. This plaister is also very good for it: Take Cammomill, Melilot, Hollihocke rootes, Lin∣séede and Fenegréeke, of each one ounce, eight or ten Figges, sixe or seuen Dates, stampe and sharpen this all together, and make a plaister thereof with water wherein Violets be decocted, and with oile of Roses. At the greatest extremitie there is to be put vnto it a little Opium, Poppy
séede, and Henbane séed. If so be that the impostume will be long a breaking, then temper a∣mongst it one ounce and a halfe of powned Pigeon dung, Mustard séed halfe an ounce, Fennell seede thrée quarters of an ounce. But if this impostume be in any place where it may be seene, or where one may come by it, then is it to be opened through other meanes: when it is open, then clense it with Barly water or Hony water, wherein Hyssop, Sauine, Madder, Mugwort, and such like be decocted. And if so be that the place must be incarnated, then take Aloe, Mirrhe, Frankinsence, Sarcocolla, Dragon blood, litharge of Gold, and prepared Tutia, of each a like quantitie; make then a salue thereof with Waxe and oyle of Roses, and vse it according as oportunitie serueth. And as be∣fore hath bene said, cooling plaisters are to be vsed for it, and to take any of the things follow∣ing, viz. Roses, Lentils, blossomes and péeles of Pomegranates, the muscilage of Fleawort, Nightshade, Tassel, fresh sliced Gourds, and Saunders; all these are to be tempered with barly meale, and sodden to a plaister, and then to be layd ouer the priuities. Afterwards in the beginning of the disease, the iuice of broade Plantaine is to be iniected of∣tentimes into the Matrix. And to the end the Matrix inwardly may be perfectly mundified, prepare this water follow∣ing: Take Gals, Lentils, Pomegranate blossomes, Butchers broome seeds, Roses and Sanders, of each a like quantitie, séeth them in water, and iniect the decoction into the place. Or take Hyssope, Wormewood, hony of Roses, séeth the same in white wine and milke, and vse it as is aforesaid. When the Matrix is cleansed from all vncleannesse, then is this bath to be vsed for to heale and to cause the flesh to grow: Take Centorie sixe ounces, Ireas, Comfrey, Cassie rootes, and Agrimonie, of each thrée handfuls, Sarcocolla, Gum, Dragon blood, Mumia, Hypocistis, and Fran∣kinsence, of each one dragme: séeth them all together in sufficient water vnto the halfe, then put thereto prepared refuse of Iron one ounce and a quarter, then let it séeth awhile and waxe colde that it may be vsed for a bath. Of all the former things may plaisters, salues and pessaries be made, for they are to that intent very méet and profitable. Or if you will haue a meane and mil∣der bath, then take Mallowes, Violet leaues, Melilot, Plantaine, Lentils, Fenegréeke, and Colewort buds, and make a bath of it. In like sort sodden Allume is auailable for this purpose, for this bath is generally commen∣ded of all learned men. But when the ague and the most paine is somewhat past, & yet the impostume remaineth still, which may be perceiued when the ague returneth, and the paine and hardnesse betweene the nauell and the priuities continueth, then are mollifying things to be vsed, as these pessaries fol∣lowing: Take Duckes grease, the marrow of Harts bones, Neates feet oyle, Bdellium, Saffron, and yolkes of rosted egges, of each a like quantitie; dissolue them together in wine, and temper therewith the bottome of oile of Lilles, then dip a taint of linnen often therein, and put it into the place: it swageth the paine, and allayeth the same. But of this hardnesse we shall shortly hereafter speake and discourse somewhat more at large. But if this impostume be caused through cold, then doth the same happen through abundance of much Phlegma in the body, and that through a continuall vse of meate and drinke, whereby the Phlegma is augmented, whereby such like humors do fall downe to that place, and there do putrifie and rankle. This impostume doth appeare with a swelling aboue the priuities neare the nauel, and that with a continuall ach, and yet no great paine, the woman is sleepie, and very lither: and these signes be the more certaine, if the time of the yéere and the age of the patient do agrée with them. For this, neither cold nor repelling remedies are méete, but maturatiues, and such as expell Phlegma, sobrietie, plaisters of méetly warme, discussiue and ripening séedes, laying on of Cam∣momil, of Melilot, Sauine, Marierom, Mugwort, Linséede, Fenegreeke, admixed with the fore∣said oiles and greases, and they may also be sodden & iniected. Likewise for this are méet, salues and plaisters which do warme, moisten and ripen, wherof we haue before admonished, and shal againe hereafter. The third manner of the impostumation of the Mother, is such a bad and hard disease, and is much worse than any of the former, especially when it is confirmed and waxen old, for then it is not to be curred, but at last there commeth the canker of it, whereof we shall immediatly
hereafter speake and discourse at large. But to do some ease for it, is the place to be annointed with warme and maturatiue oiles, marrows and greases of beasts, and the decoction of Linseed, of Fenegréeke séed, and oile of Cammomill, of Dill, or of Lillies to be iniected. Also they are to weare plaisters de Bdellio, of liquid Storax, and of Ammoniacum thereon, and to vse these fomen∣tations and bathes following: Take the rootes of Hollihocke two ounces, Cammomil, Melilot, Mallowes, Violet leaues, Linséed and Fenegréeke séed, of each one ounce, let them séeth well in water, and of these decocted herbes shall you make plaisters with some of the foresaid greases, viz. with swines grease, hens and duckes grease, &c. Vse also this salue following: Take oile of Lillies and of Elderne, cony fat, the fat of Quailes, Neates féete oyle, and oyle of Harts féete, oyle of swéet Almonds, and Butter, of each one ounce, annoint therewith the neck of the mother within and without, then annoint therwith a pessary of cotton and put it therin. And if so be the same do not content thée, then looke into the eleuenth chapter, the 29. and 30. §. of the impostumes in the stomacke. Item, of the impostume in the liuer, the 12. chapter and 7. §. and 14. chapt. and 2. §. of the im∣postume of the milt, where you shall find a sufficient direction for it. Of the canker and vlcer of the wombe or Matrix. §. 13. WHat the difference is betweene the impostume and vlcer, is before in the eleuenth Chapter, and nine and twentith §. sufficiently declared of the impostume of the stomacke. But the vlcers of the Matrix be very noisome and perillous (as we haue before alleaged) and so qualified, that very easily they may come vnto an incurable canker; for this vlcer and the canker haue a great communion one with another: yet this difference is betwéene them, that where the canker is, there must also be an vlcer, but not euery impostume the canker. Thus may vlcers be holpen with the things which be ordained for the clefts of the Arsegut, and of the womans places; where to the contra∣ry, the canker of this place is estéemed by all learned Phisitions for to be incurable. The cau∣ses of these vlcers and canker of the Matrix may be (as we haue already shewed of the vlcera∣tion in the nostrils in the first part) of wounds, of thrusts, of blowes, of fals, of some vncleane impostume, of some sharpe humors which do excoriate and exulcerate the Matrix, or the necke of the same within. The canker is commonly caused through melancholicke blood, which ma∣keth a hard impostume, and beginneth first onely of a small hardnesse, as the bignesse of a pease or Beane, and afterward increaseth, the which at last filleth the veines adiacent also with melancholicke, thicke, and blacke bloud, whereby it will be harder and greater from day to day. The heate augmenteth with pricking vntill that it breake out, whence then issueth a blacke gréene matter, and otherwhiles like as it were wine lées, and sometimes like to water, the which stinketh none otherwise than as it were a carren, and corrodeth more and more, for that is the nature of cankers. The signes of these vlcerations be paine, pricking, panting of the mother, and issue or descent of purulent matter according to the qualitie of the vlcer. But if it be caused through any outward occasion, that may be vnderstood of the sicke person her selfe. Or if it come through sharpe bloud, then is the paine sharpe, pricking with great heate and ague. Or if it be caused through Phlegma, then is the paine not too great, the place anguished, and impaireth slowly. If there run any cleere blood out of it with white corruption, then is there a small veine broken in the impostume. If the matter be like water wherein fresh flesh is washed, then is it a signe that this disease is caused through long retentiō of womens termes. If this impostume be cau∣sed of Cholera, then doth gréene matter run out of it. The signes of the canker haue we discoue∣red before. In these kind of vlcers and cankers in the wombe, do the learned prescribe certaine rules, whereof good héede is to be taken. First, in case this vlceration be very moyst, then are drying things to vsed for it. Secondly, if there be with the vlcer a venemous quality adioyned, then is this the most principall meanes of healing that the venemous quality may be taken away. Thirdly, that such kind of meate and drinke be vsed as do cleanse and make good blood, which is most commodious for to clense the vlcers of the wombe, for thereby wil the venemous matter be best of all taken away and drawne forth. Fourthly, these vlcers haue no néed of maturatiues,
for that thereby the venemous matter increaseth. Fiftly, the Phisition must vse such things as do dissolue and drie; and lastly, incarnatiues. Sixtly, if this vlcer can be séene, then is the same to be refreshed with cleane and fine clothes continually. And now to begin with some medicines: Héede must first of all be taken of a good gouerne∣ment of life, so that all that one doth eate, drinke, or vse (according to the abilitie of the patient, without the making of any heate) may be drying things, and commonly such things be ordai∣ned for this purpose as are warme in the first degrée, but strongly drying. Quietnesse in this disease is better than motion. Hereby may it easily be marked and vnderstood that all cold and moist meates be hurtfull for this patient, viz. Fish, Crabs, milke, and all that is drest with milk, much pap, fat, and such like be naught for her. Their most commodious drinke shall be a thin, red, and hard wine, which is very drying and discussiue: the same may be tempered with water wherein Mastick, two kinds of Consolida (if so be that nature can abide it) and Feuerfew be de∣cocted. Secondly, concerning the other phisick (if that nature may abide it) the veine on the right foote is to be opened against euening, yet is good regard to be had to the swouning, for that the letting of blood in the neathermost parts do bring more debilitie with it than that of the vpper parts. After the letting of bloud, this potion following is to be giuen vnto her two mornings together: Take Benedicta Laxatiua halfe an ounce, Agaricus one scruple, Ginger and Graines, the iuice of Feuerfew two ounces and a halfe, temper them together, and afterwards she is to gouerne her selfe euen as the order is after purging. Thirdly, giue her this potion ensuing the space of certaine dayes together, vntill that the vrine appeare of a good colour and very cleane: Take Oxymel of Squils halfe an ounce, Syrupus de Bysantijs and sirupe of Vineger, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Louage and Agrimonie water, of each one ounce, Cicory water two oun∣ces, this is to be drunken early in the morning: they may also sléepe well vpon it, and fast foure houres after it. This being done, minister vnto her Pillulas Benedictas foure scruples, or one dragme and a half, fourmed with the iuice of Mugwort. You may also temper one dragme of it with the foresayd water, and drinke it: and if so be that the cause require stronger remedies, then take Pillulas de Opopanaco and de Hiera composita, of each halfe a dragme: make pilles thereof as is beforesaid. With this purging one must diligently haue regard whether this vlcer or canker be so neare in the necke of the Matrix that one may come to it with the hand, likewise if the matter do stink, to the end that according to the qualitie thereof might be knowne what medicines should be vsed: but be it howsoeuer it will, Hony water is alwayes good for it. You may also cleanse the disease therewith where the vlcer is, and afterwards spread thereon this salue following: Take Aloe, Dragonblood, Mirrha, Sarcocolla, and Frankinsence, of each a like quantitie, Duckes grease as much as is néedfull for to make a mild vnguent of it. But this following is stronger: Take oyle of Feuerfew flowers and of Saffron, of each halfe an ounce, oyle of Walflowers (especially if there be great paine with it) two ounces, Sarcocolla, Mirrha, and Opopanacum, of each one dragme, Turpentine thrée quarters of an ounce, Muscus one graine, white waxe as much as is néedfull for a salue: afterwards séeth them all together in foure ounces of the iuice of Smallage vntill all the iuice be consumed, then annoint therewith a pessary made of cotton, and put it into the place, and refresh it oftentimes: it is very commodious for it, and found of∣tentimes good. But if this disease be very déepe inwardly, then doth néede require that the bo∣die be cleansed with necessary things, to wit, with Hony water, and afterwards vse the pessa∣ries which be described in the fifth Chapter and 2. §. beginning thus: Take Duckes grease, &c. and renew them foure or fiue times a day, or make this following: Take Smallage, Feuerfew, and Mugwort, all together, or each alone, stamp them together, make a pessary thereof, and an∣noint it with Hiera Picra. You may also take the iuice of these foresaid herbes, and make a cloth wet with it, and lay the same vpon the backe, the hips, and on the hithermost part of the back∣bone. For iniection, this following is ordained: Take Hony water, seeth therein Ireos and Wormewood, or séeth Agrimonie in Barley water, and temper clarified Hony, or hony of Ro∣ses amongst it. If so be that the cause require stronger remedies, then take sixe ounces of wine, burnt Allume, Verdigrease, of each halfe a dragme, temper them together, and let them stand so fiue houres, afterwards iniect it. This following is also good, and chiefly to dry the vlcers, and to draw them together: Take Gals, Pomegranat pils and the blossoms, and Allume, let it séeth to∣gether with a litle Agrimony: and if you think that there be any veine broken within the vlcer,
then temper somewhat of these things following with it, as Dragon blood, Myrrhe, Frankin∣sence, fine Bolus, Saffron, Hartwort with Rose water, or with Plantaine water. A bath for the raines is very necessary for this purpose, whereto you may prepare this follow∣ing: Take Valerian rootes, Mew, and rootes of Smallage, of each foure handfuls, Mirrha and O∣popanacum, of each one quarter of an ounce, the rootes of Yarrow foure handfuls, séeth them all in sufficient water, and sit therein to the nauell. Besides all this, there is another bath highly com∣mended, wherin the roots of wild Cucumbers be decocted. For this is also very good that which is described in the 12. §. beginning thus, Take oyle of Centory 6. ounces, &c. But in case this en∣suing matter remaine stinking, and that there be heate with it, then vse the other pessaries made of cotton and Roses, that are there discouered: but the vlcers must be cleansed before by the in∣iection of Hony water. Lastly, if so be that the hardnesse do continue, which may be perceiued by féeling, as also by the pricking, by the paine, and by issuing out of the matter, then is one to be∣ware that there be no sharpe medicines vsed for it, for that thereby the malady will be much the rather augmented, for all which is discouered in the fifth Chapter and second §. of the iniection of the muscilage of Fleawort, and iuice of Housléeke, for that is also the liuer veine to be opened, and the salue of Ceruse to be vsed. This person must also beware of all which augmenteth me∣lancholy, whereof you may find a sufficient discourse in the eleuenth Chapter and 8. §. Of an vnnaturall birth, called Mola. §. 14. IT chanceth also sometimes, that in certaine women which haue no company with a man, yet their belly swelleth vp no otherwise than as though they were with child, and all the signes of being with child agree also with it, for that their Termes be absent and stayed: they féele also some stirring in the Matrix, their breasts will be hard, the appetite of meate leaueth them, their naturall colour will be pale, all which signes are common to women with child: notwith∣standing they beare no child which beare this Mola. This Mola groweth after two sorts in the wombe: the one will grow to a péece of flesh without any figure, halfe putrified, and is also no right flesh, but rather a spongeous masse of wind, of water, and of some other superfluous bloud, which through the accustomed termes cannot be expelled, and the same then being mixed with the naturall seed, groweth otherwhiles to such a hardnesse that the same cannot be cleft a∣sunder with any hatchet. Secondly, it may also be ingendred of the said bloud and the concourse of certaine tough humors, and so make a false shew like women with child. Neuerthelesse the expert Phisitions do distinguish thrée seuerall signes, whereby bearing women, and they that be burthened with this vnnaturall masse, are to be knowne, for that first the mouing of this Mola or vnnaturall masse is not like that of a child, because it is a thing which hath no life. Secondly, the belly of women which beare Mola is much harder, and not so moueable from one place to another as theirs is that be with child. Thirdly, this masse falleth from the one side to the other. Fourthly, if a woman be burthened with Mola, then be her hands and feete very féeble and limber, and it séemeth also that her fingers be shorter, all which cannot be perceiued in bearing women. Fiftly, the woman that beareth Mola, is not so merry as one that is with child. Sixtly, a woman with child is commonly after nine moneths deli∣uered: but in the Mola is no certaine time, for that it is found that women therewith haue gone two yeares, foure yeares, and also longer, yea their whole life time, that no phisicke hath holpen them. And from these that be cured, there auoydeth oftentimes (as is sayd) a lothsome peece of flesh, and that with such paine as if she were deliuered of a child. It auoydeth some∣times into bloud, otherwhiles to wind, and their belly falleth away as before. This is such an accident, that it ought not slightly to be regarded, for that thereby it may easily be marked that the Matrix is vtterly vncleane and spoyled: therefore do these women easily fall againe into the foresayd maladies; or if not, into an vnnaturall fluxe, vlcer, or impostume of the Matrix. Lastly, they commonly fall into the Dropsies, Aseites or Tympanites, or into some other perillous sick∣nesse, whereof they die. Neuerthelesse must the Phisition not doubt of the cure, but as soone as he knoweth certainly that the woman be burthened with a Mola, and be not rightly with child, then is the woman to be commaunded that the stirre not too much, and lie for the most vpon the backe, and with her legs higher than the body, and to constraine her selfe otherwhiles
to vomit and parbrake, and refraine from all cold and moist meates, for which this potion fol∣lowing is to be made: Take S. Iohns wort, Sauine, Rosemary, field Mints, and corne Mints, Louage, Mugwort, Penniroyall and Mather, of each one handfull, Fennell, Squinant, both kindes of Parsley seede, Calmus and wild Galingall, of each one dragme, Radish foure ounces, seeth them together in a sufficient quantitie of water for a potion, and vse thereof euery day thrée or foure ounces, this potion melloweth that masse, and expelleth the humor whereby it might be increased. There is also to be tempered with this potion one of these Trociskes following: Take Cin∣namome, Myrrhe, of each two dragmes and a halfe, Rue, Sauine, field Mints, Penniroyall (al together dried) Mather, Sagapenum and Opopanacum, of each one dragme, Cardamome, Iuniper trée, Rosemary, of each one dragme and a halfe, forme the Trociskes of the waight of a quarter of an ounce. This afore described is so to be vsed the space of ten dayes or more. Other do aduise for a thing of smaller importance, to wit, that the woman two moneths eue∣ry morning early should take thrée ounces of warme Feuerfew water, and to fast foure houres at least after it. Secondly, that she euery fourth day when she drinketh of the water, should take one of these pilles: Take Galbanum one quarter of an ounce, flowers of Mugwort, Saint Iohns wort, and Asarabacca, of each one scruple, dissolue the Gum in good Wine, and make thereof sixe pilles of a dragme. She is also to purge once in fouretéene dayes with thrée quarters of an ounce of Benedicta Laxatiua tempered with two ounces of Feuerfew water. Or if she had rather pilles, that she swallow one dragme of Pillulas Foetidas. Fourthly, she is alwayes to weare this plaster following vpon the belly the breadth of a finger beneath the nauell reaching vp towards the hips: Take Galbanum one ounce and a halfe, Galliae Muscatae one quarter of an ounce, Alipta Mus∣cata one dragme, white Waxe thrée dragmes, dissolue the gum in good wine, and then make a soft plaister thereof. Fiftly, she is to vse this bath ensuing for the raines thrice a wéeke, twice a day: Take Galliae Muscatae one quarter of an ounce, Colophoniae halfe an ounce, Saint Iohns wort flowers, Beto∣ny, Mugwort, and Feuerfew, of each thrée handfuls, Bistorta fiue handfuls, séeth them together in sufficient water vntill it sauour well: she is to sit therein vp to the nauell. These be very ex∣cellent remedies for to bring the mother to good health againe, to strengthen all the parts of ge∣neration, and to ease their maladies. In fine, all those things may be vsed for this intent, which are prescribed for the expulsion of the dead child out of the mothers body, and for the secundine, and such like things moe. What commonly is good and profitable for the Matrix. §. 15. ELecampane rootes, the greater Pimpernell rootes, the rootes of Eryngus, and Ginger, all preserued, conserues of Betonie, of Gilloflowers, of Spikenard, of Lauender, and of Pionie, wine of Elecampane rootes, of Auence, of Betonie, and of Rosemary. The oyles are these, oyle of Lillies, of Rue, and of Bayes. Item, the iuice of Gentian and of other rootes which are described in the twelfth Chapter and 11. §. We haue now almost written of all especiall accidents and diseases of the wombe, whereon naturally dependeth the whole state of humane generation. But if so be that this part of the bo∣die be not sound, and without all infirmities, then is the humane séede (be it as commodious as it will) neither rightly conceiued, nor duly contained; and though it be receiued and contai∣ned, yet doth either a mischance follow after it, or at the least a féeble and weake birth. Vnfruit∣fulnesse ensueth also thereby, as we very largely haue shewed in the seauenth Chapter before, so that it séemeth not to stand without reason, that many Philosophers and learned men haue disputed and concluded. By what meanes this part once infected might be eased and prepared to fruitfulnesse, to which end it was first created, whereof, as also of the conception of fruitfull women, of their infirmities, of their deliuery, and of all that concerneth them, shall be spoken in this Chapter following.
The twentith Chapter. Of all that concerneth fruitfull and child-bearing women. WHen as in women (as oftentimes hath bene sayd) this vessell of concep∣tion is by their termes well clensed and fréed of their forementioned and all other diseases, or if some disease now present can be remedied, then néede not any one in this place take care for barrennesse. What might moue their termes, is sufficiently shewed before in the seuenth Chapter, yet notwithstanding we purpose here to speake of diuers things which are very commodiuos for conception: amongst which the first is sirupe prepared as followeth: Take Madder, Mugwort, Sauine, of each halfe a handfull, Mints, Wormewood, Fennell rootes, Squinant, Marierom, Calmus, Nep, Annis, of each halfe an ounce, Cloues, Buglosse flowers, and Balme flowers, of each thrée dragmes, Cy∣pers rootes, Galingall, Fennell, Ameos, and Siluermountaine, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cinnamome and Raisins, of each fiue dragmes, Hony as much as is néedfull: séeth them all together, and make a sirupe thereof, as hath bin taught in the first part, the fift chapter, and 6. §. Lastly, put vnto it Masticke, Ginger, Mace, Cloues, scraped Iuorie, Saffron, Nutmegs, Do∣ronicum, Zeduary and Basill, of each halfe a dragme, and beate them all together small. The second is a powder which they may vse with their meate: Take Nutmegs, Cucubes, and Ginger, of each halfe a dragme, long pepper, Mastick and Cinnamom, of each one dragme, Galingal two scruples, the séeds of the Ash trée, scraped Iuory, Siluermountaine, red and white Behen, of each one scruple, beate them small, and mixe them all together. The third is this salue folowing, Gallia Muscata, Nutmegs, Beuercod, Hares rennet, and Lau∣danum, of each one quarter of an ounce, oile of Spikenard, oile of Masticke, and oile of Mirtles, of each three dragmes, Waxe as much as is néedfull for a salue, annoint the place of the mother with it euery other day. The last is a confection prepared as followeth: Take wild yellow Rape séed, and tame Rape seed, scraped Iuorie, white and red Behen, Siluermountaine, and séedes of the Ash, of each halfe a dragme, Cinnamome, Doronicum, Mace, Cloues, Galingal, long pepper, Rosemary flowers, Balsam wood, Blattae Bisantiae, Penniroyall, and Marierom gentle, of each two scruples, Balme, Buglosse, Citron pils, of each one scruple, Indy Spica, Ambra, and pearls, of each halfe a scruple, these being mixed and powned all together very small, take eight ounces of sugar or somewhat more, séeth it in Malmsey, and make an electuary or tabulates of it. To know whether a woman be with child or no. §. 1. WHen a woman hath layen with a man, if that her places after the action be drie, the Labra and sides of the same smaller and harder, then is it a signe that she re∣taineth the receiued seede, and (if the same passe not from her in seuen dayes) she remaineth with child. Item, take Lettice, seeth it in water, and let her drink three or foure ounces of that decoction, if so be that she parbrake the same vp againe, then hath she conceiued. Take a steele needle, stick it in a new wooden dish, and let the woman make water in it, if there hang a little cloud at the néedle, then is she with child. Or let her drinke Meade fasting, if so be that she vomit the same vp againe she will proue with child. Another: Take Mace one quarter of an ounce, Saffron beaten smal one drag, wel water sixtéene ounces, Hony two spoonfuls, boile them all together as long as you would boile an egge hard, let her drinke the third part therof when she goeth to bed, and continue it the space of three dayes together; if so be that thereby she get not her termes, then is she vndoubtedly with child: which of these thou mayest best beleeue, experience will teach thee. The common signes that a woman hath conceiued, be these, to wit, when her termes without ague and cold be stayd, for then the blood is deuided thrée maner of wayes, the subtillest doth féed the fruit, the middlemost doth by certaine veines passe towards the breasts for a preparation of the milke, the grossest remaineth in the Matrix which wil be expelled in and after the deliuery. Item, when a woman is conceiued, then doth she find great wambling and distemperature
in the stomacke, inappetencie to meate, vomiting, with other symptomes more, as hath bene shewed in the former Chapter, the 14. §. of Mola. She findeth also commonly the tenth day great headach, giddinesse, and darknesse of the eyes. It is also sayd, if a woman perceiue immediatly after she hath layen with a man small paine and cold about the raines, that it is a sure signe of conception. To know whether a woman be with child of a Boy or a Girle. §. 2. ALbeit there be diuers signes whether a woman be conceiued of a Boy or a Girle, yet are they not so sure that one may stedfastly beléeue them: for example, it is adiudged that those women which beare a boy, haue the right breast sooner hard and round than the left, but experience teacheth the contrary, and so it is with all the other signes; wherefore it séemeth superfluous to spend any time in this behalfe: but because we are now come to the conception of mankind, we will speake of the symptomes and signes which are perceiued in the women with child. Of those things which commonly appeare in women with child. §. 3. THose that haue conceiued a man child, are for the most part better of colour, lustier, nimbler of their ioynts, and lesse troubled in the bearing than of a mai∣den child: they haue also a better appetite to their meate; they do féele the most burthen in the right side, in which place they also perceiue the first motion and stirring of the child: the pulses be on the right side more stronger and swif∣ter than on the left. When they rise from sitting, then do the lift vp themselues with the right hand; the right eye looketh more liuely than the left, and in going they common∣ly set their right foote forwards. But when they beare a maiden child, then iudge all the fore∣said signes to the contrary, they are paler, leaner, more pensiue, and more troubled in the bea∣ring. The man child stirreth lower in the mothers bodie, and (as the common opinion is) most of all in the right side. The legges and places do otherwhiles swell. It is also affirmed, that if milke be dropped on her vrine, it should swimme on the top. Likewise if she beare a sonne, then perceiueth she on the 40. day the milke to come into her breasts with a kind of tickling. And when she is with child with a daughter, she findeth the same about the 90. day. Aristotle neuerthelesse acknowledgeth, and diuers more, that this (as we haue sayd before) is not al∣wayes certaine, but with the motion in the right or left sides of a man or maiden child it sel∣dome hapneth to the contrary, as may appeare in beasts, which at one time commonly do beare two yong ones, as Goates, Sheepe, &c. At what time and in what maner the child groweth in the wombe. §. 4. ALbeit this concerne no Phisicke, but is rather a worke of nature than any part of our science, yet doth our methode require that we should shew in what time, and also how the child doth increase and grow in his mothers bodie. First, there is also (as hath bene sayd before) a great difference betwéene boyes and girles, to wit, the man child receiueth both forme and life much sooner than the maiden child; yet the perfect fashioning of a man or maiden child is in manner as followeth. In the first sixe dayes the séede doth swell like to a bladder full of wind, or a windy egge, nine dayes after that doth this bladder draw bloud vnto it, whereby in twelue dayes the liuer, the heart and the braines are so euidently formed, that they seuerally may be séene and per∣ceiued about the 27. day. It is called of the Grecians Embryo or Foetus, that is, a fruite, whereof afterwards a perfect man is formed; the other members are fashioned within 18. dayes follow∣ing, so that the summe of all this time amounteth to 4. dayes, in which space the life is for the most part also receiued, although the child (by reason of his weaknesse) séeme rather to be still than to moue euen to the 90. day. When as now vnto this number which maketh in all 135. dayes, is added as much more, then (saith Hippocrates) you haue the true time of the birth, which is iust nine moneths, counting thirtie dayes for euery moneth: but as we haue said be∣fore,
al things are longer deferred with a girle than with a boy, for they commonly be not borne before the tenth moneth. Secondly, some suppose that if a man child be borne in the seuenth moneth (as it otherwhiles befals) that the fruite was perfectly formed at the first in 30. dayes, and began to liue and moue in the 40. But a maiden child borne in the 7. moneth receiueth her perfection in 35. dayes, and beginneth to stirre about the 60. day, and both of them are perfected in a 100. dayes: but a man child which hath bene borne vntill the ninth moneth, that getteth his perfect forme in 45. dayes, and stirreth about the 100. day, is borne into the world about the 300. day. But the maiden children are fully fashioned about the 60. day, they stir about the fourescore day, and are brought into the world about the 279. day. The cause why men children are sooner fashioned in the mothers wombe, is, because the séede and the right side wherein they be conceiued are hotter. Thirdly, we reade, that in the first moneth the conception should be nought else but a col∣lection of bloud, in the second moneth a forming of the bodie, in the third moneth a perfect body, in the fourth moneth the nailes do grow, in the fift moneth it getteth the perfect signes of a man or a woman child, in the sixth moneth do the veines beginne to appeare, in the seuenth moneth doth the marrow grow in the bones, in the eight moneth are the bones hardened and strengthe∣ned, in the ninth moueth doth it get a full proportion of man or woman, and prepareth it selfe for birth. Albertus Magnus in the ninth booke and fifth Chapter De Animalibus, sheweth diuers more diuisions of the kinds, and concludeth with these words following: That which the Phisiti∣ons do write of this matter, is not sufficiently approoued: and they are not alwayes found to speake the truth. These are the words of the foresaid Albertus. Now that this is true, appeareth by the difference of the foresaid computations. It differeth also sometimes according to the health and debilitie of the parent, whereby the fruite of necessitie is gouerned, and is brought into the world sooner or later; wherefore it may iustly be said, that in this matter no certaintie may be found. The order of diet for women with child. §. 5. WHen God hath endued a woman with his gracious blessing, that in the state of wedlocke she should conceiue with child, then let her take héede that she cast not away the gift of God voluntarily by some great misdiet, but that she acknow∣ledge the goodnesse of God, and liue in such sort, that by her diet the conceiued fruite be not onely not harmed, but cherished and strengthened, and fall not into any mishap or mischance whatsoeuer. To this end we will at this present prescribe certaine rules: first, a woman conceiued shall alwayes contend to be loose in body, for the which she is to eate euery morning before breakfast some ripe stued Prunes, especially if she be bound. Also she is to beware of all manner of néedlesse labour, of leaping, dauncing, vomiting, coughing, much venery, and especially presently after meales: also of great sorrow, frighting, feare, anger, and such like. Neither may she bathe her selfe, vnlesse it were some few dayes before her child∣birth, for then is it very commodious, as hereafter shall be shewed more at large. All maner of cold, all kind of stenches, all sharpe and bitter meates, as Capers, vnripe Oliues, Radishes, French beanes, Lupins, red pease, Rue, white water Mints, Penniroyall, and whatsoeuer else might prouoke her termes, is hurtful to her. Contrariwise, she may vse all maner of wholesome accustomed meates, and drinke good red wine, or méetly strong Béere, for the red wine is méeter for her than the white. Item, ripe fruits that are somewhat astringent, and that do strengthen the stomacke, are very méete for her, as Quinces, Peares, &c. if she desire any other commodious meate, she shall not so strictly be kept from it, but that she may vse a little of it at once. But if so be that she do long for some vn∣naturall and vnaccustomed meate, then is she to be dealt withall as hereafter in this next §. that be shewed. For to strengthen her, serueth the warme confection of Diamargariton, for it comforteth the stomacke and the Matrix. For the same purpose serueth also this wine following, a litle draught otherwhiles taken of it: Take Ginger & Cloues, of each one drag. rootes of Louage, Spikenard, white pepper, of each halfe a dragme, Comin, Galingall, Annis séedes, of each halfe an ounce, red Wine thrée pints, Sugar as much as you please, make Hipocras. If the woman be hot by
nature, then do lay that wine with the decoction of Currans: what she ought to obserue beside this, may you find euery where in the discourse of conceiued women. Of the strange longing of women with child. §. 6. ALbeit that this disease of this vnnaturall appetite, which otherwhiles hapneth to women with child, of some foule or vnusuall meates, as Chalke, Coales, Lime, earth, Tarre, raw flesh, fish, and such like, which is sometimes rather an imagination, and an idle or vaine conceit of some vntoward women: neuer∣thelesse the Philosophers do alleage a certaine naturall cause thereof, and af∣firme therewith, that this vnnaturall lust doth also come sometimes vpon them which be not with child, yea also that men be otherwhiles plagued with it, although very sel∣dome: wherefore this longing (by good reason) may also be reckoned amongst the vnnaturall hungers, and may be called a corrupting, as we before in the eleuenth Chapter haue moued somewhat thereof, and haue alwayes hitherto determimed to write somewhat thereof. This vnnaturall longing do the Gréeks call Cittam, the Latinists Picam and Malaciam, that is, a desire of bad meate, and is thus described. Citta is a bad action of the stomack, wherein the partie is gréedie to eate vnnaturall and foule things. The causes of this vnnaturall desire, are very bad humors, and especially Melancholia, which lieth in the stomacke, where the same is excitating this vnnaturall longing. In women with child, the matter of the termes doth cause it which cometh into the stomacke: and because the same is of sundrie natures, therefore do they also get diuers lusts. But in those that be not with child, it doth come through retention of the termes, when those humors happen to ascend into the necke of the stomack, or by the obstruction of the liuer or the milt, whereby the said me∣lancholicke humor doth stirre vp this vnnatural longing. The same bad melancholike humors may also be burnt in the stomacke, as may appeare in the quartaine ague. And for to remedie this disease (especially in women with child) must first héed be taken to their meate and drinke. Rosted Lambe, Hens, Pullets, Partridges, and all kind of field fowles are very méete for her: yea also otherwhiles buckes braines and shéepes braines, whether they be rosted or sod. Her drinke shall be good white wine. After meate shall she eate rosted Peares, Hasell nuts, Marmalade, confected Pomegranats, and Chestnuts. Giue her also oftentimes Marmalade with spices, which you shal find described in the last part. Of the confection Diantha is euery morning about halfe a quarter of an ounce to be vsed. Item, giue her oftentimes the Syrupum de Montha. In like maner is good for her the Mina of Quinces, temper them both as much as you please, and take thrée spoonefuls thereof before meate. It is also much aduised for this woman that she must otherwhiles incline her self to parbrake and vomit, as with cleere warme water and sirupe of Vineger, wherof we wil here∣after speake more at large, because that women conceiued are much addicted vnto it. But in case that they incline themselues to vomit, then is their stomacke to be annointed with this salue following. Take Masticke and oyle of Spike, of each a like quantitie, Vineger a little; lay this plaister following vpon it, the flowers of Buglosse, of Baulme, of Saunders, Citron pils, of each a like quantitie, with oile of Masticke and waxe wrought together: or a bag made of the foresaid, ex∣cept the oile of Masticke and waxe, and so layd vpon the necke of the stomacke. But if it happen that they at any time desired that which might nourish them, and that they were detained from it, or that the same could not be gotten, whereby it came to passe that they were disquieted or vexed, then take presently a spoonefull of Hony, scrape a little Nutmeg in it, and so giue it her. If so be that any man or woman (being not with child) were taken with such vnnatural lust, they are to take these things following fasting, as Oxymel compositum two ounces with water of Cipers rootes, or the decoction of Cardamome, or take one ounce and a halfe of Oxymel of squils with the foresayd water: afterwards to prouoke vomit are they to vse this Hony water fol∣lowing, wherein Mustard séede, the seede of Orage, of Dill, Onions, and Radishes is decocted. For to purge, take Pillulas Stomachicas, or de quinque generibus Mirobalanorum, which you will, one dragme: whereupon these confections following are to be vsed, viz. Diapliris, Diamoschu, and
Diambra. The stomacke is to be strengthened with these things following: Take Acorne cups one quarter of an ounce, Raisins with their stones seuen dragmes, Annis thrée dragmes, Mi∣robalani Indici, Bellirici, Emblici, of each fiue dragms, prepared refuse of iron one ounce and a quar∣ter, foure quarts of wine which is somewhat strong, and as much water: séeth them all together vnto the half, and then straine it through a cloth, and let the patient drinke it out now and then in the space of eight dayes. Item, take Cardamome, Graines, Cucubes, of each a like quantitie, white Sugar as much as all the rest: giue thereof euery morning one dragme and a halfe with luke-warme water, afterwards vse the foresayd confections, and annoint the stomacke, and kéepe your selfe with eating and drinking like as is said before. Of the vomiting in women with child. §. 7. WIth this vomiting are commonly women with child oppressed, vntill that they do begin to feele the milke, and about the time they were wont to get their flow∣ers, or whē the childs haire beginneth to grow, then haue they it most grieuous. Also it is the more troublesome, for that as then all strange lustes do come vnto them. Neuerthelesse it oftentimes hapneth not long after they haue conceiued, that they as then are most inclined vnto it. It is also otherwhiles commodious for them, as we haue shewed before. But if so be that it do get the mastery, and that thereby the foode be drawne away from the fruite, then must one do his best for to strengthen the stomacke and to remedie the vomiting: for which there be many remedies in the eleuenth chapter and eleuenth §. described against the debilitie of the stomacke, out of which may easily be chosen what is méet for women with child, but especially these things following be aduised for safe things, as the sirupe of Raspes, Mar∣malade, and sirupe of Quinces, which the ancient Phisitions do so highly commend, if a woman with child do vse the same much, then wil the fruit be subtiller and whiter, Annis, Fennell, Co∣riander, whether they be confected or not, are good against vomiting. Item, take a hard sodden egge, and kéepe it very warme vpon the mouth of the stomacke. For this is also passing good the sirupe of Veriuice. When a child is weake in his mothers wombe. §. 8. FOrasmuch as there is no doubt that the conceiued children be also sicke in their mothers body, therefore it is no small question how they are to be holpen. For séeing all sicknesses are knowne through féeling and sight, the which cannot be done by children in their mothers wombe, for this cause this matter is trouble∣some to the Phisitions. But amongst other signes whereby it may be knowne, whether the child be sicke in his mothers body or no, it is the very certainest if that the woman with child haue her termes oftentimes and much: for that there can follow none other thereof but a debilitie of the child, because that his sustenance and nourishment is taken and drawne from him. Secondly, when the milke runneth from women with child, then is it a sure token of the debi∣litie of the child: also that the child is not strong enough for to draw his nourishment vnto it. Thirdly, if a woman do get a strong scouring, then is it much to be doubted of a mischance, but it dependeth specially on two things, vnder which al other accidents (be they how they wil) are contained, which is heate and cold, by which all the rest may easily be adiudged. First (for to write of the debilitie of the child through heate and dryth) is the mother to be purged of Cholera, viz. with this following, and such like: Take conserue of Prunes without any other addition halfe an ounce, warme whay of milke thrée ounces, giue it vnto her in the mor∣ning betimes, and let her fast vpon it the space of fiue houres. Or take prepared Cassie one ounce with foure ounces of Sorrell water or Barley water. If you will haue it stronger: Take two ounces of Manna, temper them together in thrée or foure ounces of whay, and vse it as before. Or if you wil you may stéepe in the former a dragme of Rubarbe, and wring it out well; or halfe a dragme of Rubarbe beaten to powder giuen with∣out
stéeping. All these medicines be very safe for the child and the mother. Concerning the order of diet, it is to be cooling and moistening, as with Lettice, Béetes, &c. like as is oftentimes admonished. Also Barly water and Barly paps are to be vsed, the fresh is to be drest with vineger and ver∣iuice, with the iuice of Limons, and such like that she eateth. Afterwards she is to drinke euery morning a good draught of whay in sommer colde, and in winter warme. Or take water of Endiue and of Violets, of each two ounces. Or if you will haue that which cooleth more, take sirupe of Roses & of Endiue, of each halfe an ounce, Succorie water two ounces, temper them together. These things following are yet more forcible than the former: Take sirupe of Vineger half an ounce, sirupe of Citrons one ounce, Buglosse water and water of Sorrell, of each one ounce and a halfe, temper them all together. You may also drinke one ounce of the conserue of Violets, tempered with thrée ounces of Endiue water. The clisters with those things which force vrine and blood, and also all things which cause vomiting must be forborne. But if it be néedfull that one purge more, then shall the former suf∣fice. But these thrée things are especially to be shunned. One must also do his best for to defend & resist all bad properties, and to strengthen the same, which may be done in this maner following, to wit, that the woman euery day thrée or foure times do drinke halfe an ounce of the sirupe of Limons with Barley water, it cooleth and quen∣cheth thirst. Item, take water of Citruls and of Violets, of each sixe ounces, water of Sorrell twelue ounces, red Saunders, Roses, burnt Iuorie, and séed of Sorrel, of each one scruple, Saf∣fron halfe a scruple, Vineger thrée spoonefuls, temper them all together, and make a cloth wet therein; afterwards lay it beneath on the priuities, and behind on the rump. Also take then one ounce of small cut Pompeon péeles, oile of Roses, and of water Lillies, of each one ounce and a halfe, small fresh Housléeke one ounce, temper them all well together, and annoint the foresayd places with it thrée or foure times a day. But if this debilitie do come through cold and moisture, then is this thus to be remedied: Take Buglosse water, the séedes of wild Saffron, grosse beaten Agaricus, and Hermodactils, of each one scruple, Cinnamom, Ginger, Roses, and prepared Coriander, of each foure graines, let them stéepe together one whole night, afterwards wring it out, and drinke it in the morning early. Another. Take the water of Feuerfew and of Balme, of each one ounce and a halfe, Benedicta Laxatiua one ounce, white sugar halfe an ounce, temper them together, and let them stand the whole night, afterwards straine it through a cloth, and vse it as the other. For this is also a good order of diet to be obserued, wherefore these patients are to vse nothing else but that is warme and drie of nature. And she is to boile in all her meates Sage, Mints, Rosemary, and such like, which haue no nature of opening. Their drinke is to be méetly strong red wine tempered with a little stéeled water; for it hath power to strengthen all the inward no∣rishing parts, and all veines. One must also deuise how to amend and clense these bad humors, which is thus to be effected: Take Sage water foure ounces, Miua of Quinces one ounce, then mixe them all together. Item, take Sirupum de Myrto one ounce, water of Baulme wherein Masticke is decocted, thrée ounces, temper them together, and so giue it her to drinke. A better. Take Miua Citoniorum aromatica one ounce, water wherein Mirtle séed is decocted thrée ounces, temper them to a potion. There may also be vsed in the morning early for a streng∣thening, halfe an ounce of confected Calmus. Likewise Aromaticum rosatum, Rosata nouella, and conserue of Roses tempered with powder of Masticke, and with Mints water being drunken. If it be needfull for to purge, then is one to vse the former purgations without giuing any stronger thing. This ensuing is also very commodious: Take the iuice of red Mints foure oun∣ces, Agaricus one dragme, let it stéepe together two dayes and two nights, then temper Ginger and Roses therewith, of each foure graines, Manna halfe an ounce, let it stand drying in the warmth, afterwards make pilles thereof, and vse them oftentimes, for they purge the watery humors without any anguish. Now for to remedie the venemous matter, for which you haue hereafter thrée kinds of ap∣plications: Take Roses, Cipers nuts, burnt Iuorie, and Sandaraca, of each one dragme, Rosin thrée ounces, but you are to seeth the Rosin in red Vineger vntill that the Vineger be spent:
afterwards temper the other ingredients amongst it, and make two plaisters of it, one quarter and a halfe of a yard long, and lay the one behind and the other before vpon the place of the Mother. One more forcible: Take oile of Quinces, of Roses, and of Mints, of each one ounce and a halfe, Comfrey, Bloodstone, red Corall, Sandaraca, and burnt Date stones, of each one dragme, Waxe as much as is néedfull for a salue, annoint therewith the place of the Mother and of the kidneyes: both these haue so strengthened the fruit in sundry women, that they haue fully borne the same, which accustomed to lie in too soone of all their former children. Thirdly, take the water of Tassell and water of Knotgrasse, of each sixe ounces, water of gréene Cipers nuts, or their decoction, foure ounces, the iuice of Sloes, burnt Iuorie, and Roses, of each one dragme, Frankinsence, Sandaraca, and Colophonie, of each one dragme and a halfe, the iuice of Quinces sixe ounces, temper them well, and make a cloth wet therein eight double, and so lay it warme vpon the backe. Of mischances or vntimely birthes. §. 9. THis vntimely childbirth or mischance, may befall at any time without any dif∣ference after that women haue conceiued: as when the séede is not yet come to any perfect shape, or when the fruite hath some members, but yet before it come to be a perfect child, or is brought into the world before the due time, being not throughly borne, or when it is violently or otherwise expelled. And it fareth therewith as it doth with the fruits of trées, when they begin first to bud and to fashion, then do they hang on brittle stalkes, so that otherwhiles they may be blowne off and spoyled with a small wind: but being waxen greater, then is there to come greater force of windes or otherwise before they will fall off: lastly, when they be waxen very ripe and seaso∣nable, then do they fall off of themselues. In like manner doth it also happen with the conceiued séed or fruite, which is at the first so weake and tender, that if a woman chance to leape, to fall, or to labour hard, the séede receiued is thereby diuers times eiected. Wherefore also betwéene foure and seauen moneths she may purge most safely, and vse phisicke if néede require: for be∣fore the foure and after the seuen moneths must she forbeare it (if possibly it may be) for then it is perillous. But to returne to our purpose. We haue shewed before, that if a woman hath retained hu∣mane séed the space of seuen dayes, that it is a token of conception: but if it vade or auoyd with∣in seuen dayes, then do the learned call it Effluxionem, which is an effluence or running out. But if so be that they detaine it any longer time, and this effluence chance within fortie dayes, then is it an Abortus, that is, a mischance: and within this time of fortie dayes, do most mischan∣ces happen. Thus if a boy be conceiued, and voyd away within fortie dayes, then is there none other shape to be seene thereof, but in case it be cast into cold water, there doth it make shew as a small bladder, and making it open, then is the fruite found in it as a great Cricket, with all his seuerall members, and likewise also the humane member. And if a maiden child conceiued chance to auoide or passe away within thrée moneths, then can no direction or token be seene, for that it consumeth in the water: but in case that it do come to the fourth moneth, then may some direction be séene thereby, but it soone consumeth and passeth away: for that (as we haue said be∣fore) the girles receiue their perfect fashion much later than the boyes, as also they be borne for the most part in the tenth moneth. But when they be now come both into the world, the girles grow much faster than the boyes, and also do come sooner to their time of generation, and leaue off much sooner, especially they that get many children one after another. The causes of these mischances or vntimely births, do the learned alleage to be of many sorts, which may neuerthelesse be comprehended in foure principall articles, viz. of outward causes which procéed of the conceiued fruite, when the Matrix hath any kind of disease; or if the humane séed be of no good disposition. Amongst outward causes be these, leaping, running, wrin∣ging, and chiefly in lying together, bathes, anger, sorrow, feare, trembling, loud calling, strong labour, surfetting of meate, and diureticall things, as Fennell, Parsley séed, and all other things which expell the stone. All hot spices, as Ginger, Galingall, Cinnamome, Annis, and such like. Item, all that purgeth violently, as Aloe, Epithymus, Coloquint, Scamony, and Euphorbium.
In like maner all scouring or laxes, the bloody flixe, or the fluxe of the termes. The same may also happen if a woman haue any strange lust or longing, which she cannot come at or get it, and moe other such like causes, whereof we haue spoken before, whereof it is better to be silent than to disclose the same. Also the conceiued fruit otherwhiles falleth downewards before her limited time, whether it be for that it is sicke or dead, or for that it remaineth not with the face towards the backe, with the hands vpon the eyes, and the elbowes vpon the knées, as the naturall situation of it is. Likewise also if the fruite through any disease of the parents, be infected whether in the séed or otherwise, wherewith also the fourth cause is approoued. But if the conceiued séede find any disease in the Matrix (be it whatsoeuer sicknesse or disease that it will) then must the fruite inherite it. This reason following is also occasion of an vntimely birth, to wit, when a woman is much and vnmeasurable leane, conceiuing she will very seldome haue full birth: but if the Mo∣ther be excéeding leane (whence the fruite must sucke or draw his nourishment) then will it be inféebled or diseased, and constrained to passe away, as hereafter shall be more ampler sayd and taught. Women which be méetly fat or leane, and neuerthelesse get a mischance euery third or fourth moneth that commeth (beside the former causes) of some slimie waterish humours which fall downe into the veines and sinewes, whereon the secundine is fastened, whereby they do slacke, are loose, and can sustaine the burthen no longer, without falling out of the mo∣thers body. By the breasts may also a mischance be perceiued, for that when they be small, weake and flack in women with child, then is a mischance to be looked for and expected. When a child be∣ginneth to come to his perfection, then hath it néede of much nourishment. And if there be any disease or infirmitie there, then will the breasts be small, soft, and slack, whereof the fruite must pine and die. Or she will be impatient, striueth and strugleth so long vntill the secundine brea∣keth, and the fruite falleth away. Now if a woman be pregnant with two children, and one breast onely (whether it be the left or right) came to be small and slacke, then is it a signe of the destruction of the child on the same side. It is also found that certaine women through stench of the snuffing of a candle or lampe, haue gotten a mischance. Let this suffice of the mischance or vntimely birth: we will now teach how the same is to be remedied. How a mischance is to be preuented or hindered. §. 10. WE haue before shewed that women conceiued sometimes do get their termes, whereby that weake and spare, yea also dead children be brought into the world, which happeneth not without great perill of their life: wherefore must we writs and discourse somewhat thereof. First, the termes do commonly come with paine of the backbone, of the belly, and the priuities, which be altogether signes of a mischance to come: for (like as we haue said) thereby is the nourishment drawne away from the fruite; whereby it is not onely inféebled, but also vrged to passe away. And to obuiate or preuent this, all child-bearing women are first to beware from ouerhote, cold, and ouermoist aire. All meate and drinke which be too fat, too sharpe, and to bitter, shall she also eschue, as Radishes, Parsley, Smallage, Fennell, Pease broth, Cinnamome, Saffron, Galingall, Nutmegs, and such like spices. She is also to vse oftentimes thicke red wine, but she is to eschue all great exercise of going, running, leaping, accompany of a man, anger, and all ouerburthening: and therewith haue regard that she alwayes haue a soluble bodie, and if so be that be wanting, then is she to vse some meate or drinke which do loose the body, as the decoction of Mallowes, or Mercury, or stewed Prunes. Otherwise she is to leaue all clisters and other diureticall medicines. But if the body be ob∣structed too much, then is she to eate Cassie wood out of the pipes, or new prepared Cassie, and that especially if she haue any issue or moistnesse in the necke of the Matrix; for that the Cassie
doth cleanse the Cholera and Phlegma without any trouble: you are also in due time to put Ru∣barbe, vnto it; yet Manna is more commended for it: powned Rubarb is also to be giuen to con∣ceiued women as it is; for so it is more effectuall than if she tooke the infusion onely. Item, if so be that there appeare in the necke of the Mother some sliminesse or moistnesse in the last moneth, then is she to vse all things rosted, baked, and to do such exercises before meate as shall be drying: also take Pomegranate péeles, powne them grosse, and séeth them in oyle of Lillies, and iniect that into the Mother. That is the right meane for to stay the slipperinesse of the Matrix. Afterwards take Masticke, Mirrha, and Gallia Muscata, of each halfe a dragme, Goosegrease one ounce, dip therein vnkemmed shéepes wooll, and put it into the places. Hares rennet, or the rennet of any other beast is maruellous good for it, whether there be any heate or impostume instant. Burnt Iuorie and the powder of Zeduarie tempered together and strowed on the meate doth stay also the mischance. To this end is also to be séene what is written before in the ninth Chapter and third §. of the excessiue termes, all which is also méete for this vse. But she may vse these things following, as the confection of Pearles, of which Auicenna de∣scribeth alwayes to eate one tabulate before meate, and thereupon to drinke a good draught of wine, as she may do it very commodiously betwéene both meale-tides twise or thrise a day. Secondly, take the water of Mints, of Daisies, and water wherein Cipers nuts be decocted, of each one ounce, Sugar halfe an ounce; drinke this early in the morning all together at one draught, whether it be cold or warme. Thirdly, take scrapt Iuorie, red and white Corall, Masticke, Mints, the inward red péeles of Chestnuts, Acornes, Mirtle séed, and Cypers nuts, of each halfe a dragme: make pils thereof with the iuice of Comfrey, whereof thrée are to be taken in the morning with the foresaid water before meate, and that afterwards she hath taken one of the foresaid tabulats. Fourthly, take Cipers nuts, powned Gals, Mirtle séed, iuice of Sloes and Hypocistis, of each halfe a dragme, Bloodstone, Amber, Dragonblood, and fine Bolus, of each one dragme and a halfe, refuse of Iron which hath bene long decocted in vineger, halfe an ounce, the innermost red péeles of Chestnuts one ounce, thrée or foure whites of egs, powne all that is to be powned, and rub it all together a long time in a leaden mortar, then annoint therewith the whole belly from the nauell to the priuities foure times a day. Fiftly, make this plaister ensuing: Take Dragagant and Gumme, both of them rosted, and Bdellium, of each one quarter of an ounce, the iuice of Sloes, Frankinsence, Hypocistis and Sanda∣raca. of each one dragme, fine Bolus and Dragonblood, of each one quarter of an ounce, Wax half an ounce, Paperglew dissolued in red vineger two ounces, make a plaister thereof, and lay vpon the priuities, let it lie so, and if the same must be taken off for any certaine cause, then lay it on againe by and by: and if there be too little Waxe and oyle of Masticke, then take as much as is néedfull of it. Another. Take Frankinsence, Masticke, Dragonblood and fine Bolus, of each one quarter of an ounce, Comin thrée dragmes, Pitch one ounce and a halfe, three small Cypers nuts, Waxe and oyle of Masticke, as much as is néedfull for to make a plaister: spread them on a cloth, and vse it as is sayd before. Make also this salue following: Take oyle of Nuts foure ounces, Barrowes grease one ounce and a halfe, three small Cipers nuts, Masticke one dragme and a halfe, let them seeth softly the space of fiue houres, and therewith annoint the place of the Matrix, which is betweene the nauel and the priuities, and behind vpon the backe ouer against it. It is also written, that it is wonderfull good to weare alwayes a Diamond on the finger. Item, if a woman with child be burthened with an Ague, and that a mischance be doubted, then take Barley meale, the iuice of Sloes and of Housleeke, as much as you please, make it to a plaister with vineger, and then lay it oftentimes vpon the belly: this plaister doth defend the fruite from all accidents in the Ague; this sayd plaister is also to be layd vpon the liuer. In case that now the woman with child be assayled with pricking, then haue you before in the second part, the fourth Chapter, and 12. §. how that might be remedied: stamped Crabs, the iuice there∣of wroong out, and tempered amongst womans milke; it defendeth also the vntimely birth of
women, and it is said that it is a sure remedy for it. If so be that a mischance be feared through much wind, then giue one dragme of good Mi∣thridate with the water wherein Comin hath bene decocted, twice a weeke; for thereby will the fruite be preserued and retained. These confections or tabulats following are to be vsed: Take Pearles and Pyretrum, of each one dragme, Ginger, Mastick, of each halfe an ounce, Zeduary, Doronicum, the séed of Smallage, Cassie wood, Cardamome, Nutmegs, Mace and Cinnamome, of each one quarter of an ounce, red and white Behen, long and black Pepper, of each three dragmes, Saffron one dragme, sugar eighteene ounces or lesse, decocted with the water of Buglosse, or water of Mints. How a dead child is to be expelled out of his mothers wombe. §. 11. FOr this we wil first haue remembred all that is described before in the 19. chap∣ter and 14. §. of the vnnaturall excrescence Mola in the Matrix, whereof that in the second §. of prouoking the termes, and before of the mischances, and all that is discouered of the preferring of the birth, is also meete for the expulsion or de∣liuery of a child; so that betwéene these is none other difference than that this following is ordained rather for perfect children, of which women do com∣monly lie in within fiue or sixe moneths. Now for to preuent the same, are these remedies follo∣wing commanded to be presently vsed, but first of all you must know whether the child be dead or not, to the end there be not a sicke child expelled for a dead child: the which is to be knowne by this, and especially if it hath bene dead two or thrée dayes. First, the mother doth get a great paine in the sinewes of the eyes, which be Optici nerui. Secondly, she doth also féele paine behind in the necke stretching downeward along the backe bone, because that the Matrix is fastened vnto it. Thirdly, shée doth féele great anguish and paine beneath. Fourthly, if a woman lie from one side vnto another, then doth the burthen alwayes follow towards the lower side, which is of all other a sure token of a dead child, and that the ligaments of the se∣cundine haue no more force to hold the dead fruite in one place. Fiftly, there is a great paine about the priuities, and ouer all the necke of the Matrix. Sixtly, the thicknesse of the belly which was aboue is wholy sunken downe. Seuenthly, they do féele continually a cold about the priuities. Eightly, if one hold a warme hand long vpon the belly and féele no stirring, then it is a sure token that the child is dead. These be now the signes of a dead child before it be∣gin to putrifie. When it hath bene dead thrée dayes, then beginneth it to stinke; the woman is full of agues and getteth a stinking breath; out of the Matrix runneth a foule stinking matter; the belly will be heauy, and stinking winds, which do arise in the mother, cause swelling thereof: and last of all there will be foule and stinking péeces of flesh expelled through the necke of the mother. When al these things be séene, then hath a Phisition none other thing to do but to driue out the dead child. It is also néedfull before all other things to preserue and strengthen the heart from al filthy stenches, which may be brought to passe with this powder following, taking the same of∣tentimes with broths, for that it strengtheneth the vitall spirits, and also the heart: it doth also withstand the ascending vapors. Take white Diptamus one dragme and a half, Citron péeles, and the péeled séeds of the same, of each halfe a dragme, prepared pearles foure scruples, prepared Coriander one scruple, Roses two scruples, sugar two ounces and a halfe: temper them all together to powder, and vse therof about one quarter of an ounce at once. Or take this following: Take white Diptamus and Zeduary, of each one scruple, prepared Pearles, and Species de gemmis frigidis, of each halfe a dragme, mixe them together, and giue it her to drinke at thrice, it withstandeth all stenches that they infect not the heart. The fine Treacle doth also driue dead children out of the mothers bodies. In like manner also the iuice of Verueine, or the herbe stamped and drunken with wine, dri∣ueth forth also the dead fruite: so doth Hyssope also. Take Trociscos de Gallia one dragme, giue it with small white wine, they expell the dead child and the secundine, and make an easie birth. Item, take the innermost skins of the mawes of Hens or of Capons, wash the same in wine, drie them, and powne them to powder, giue one
dragme, or one dragme and a halfe thereof with a draught of Wine, or with some broth, or with Rosewater. Or take Betonie and Rue with the rootes, of each one handfull, poure thereto one ounce of the iuice of Salomons seale, white Wine one pint; let it séeth well, then straine it through a cloth, and so giue it her to drinke. Séeth Iuniper berries in Hony, temper some wine with it, and so drinke it together. Another: Womans milke drunken should also expell the dead child: likewise also the precious stone Iaspis. This is a common medicine which followeth here∣after: Take Boreas one dragme and a halfe, Cinnamom and Saffron, of each one scruple, stamp them togither, and giue it with swéete wine or Mugwort water to drinke, it helpeth much to beare easily. It is also said, that Linséed passeth all things to make women to be easily deliuered, for if they drinke the water which is decocted therewith, and put the same with clothes beneath into the bodie, or bath therein, then must the dead fruit auoyd. Or take Mirrha as much as the quantity of a hasell nut, stampe it, and giue it with wine, or with water of Mugwort: the same expelleth much, whether that the child be dead or aliue. The same doth also dogges milke tempered with hony. Item, take one ounce of Goates milke, dissolue therein two scruples of Galbanum, and so giue it: it expelleth maruellously. Or if the woman be strong, then giue her as much of the iuice of Garlicke as will go into halfe an egshel with wine or hony. If from a woman through frigh∣ting or otherwise the child auoid, then take a Crab, stampe it, and wring out the iuice, and then temper it with the water of Mugwort, and so drinke it. For pils: Take Trociscos de Mirrha one scruple, Galbanum halfe a scruple, make fiue pils therof with Penniroyall water. Another: Take the fruite of the Sauine trée one quarter of an ounce, Assa foetida, Ammoniacum and Madder, of each halfe a dragme: make eleuen pilles thereof, then take thereof at each time one, and that thrice a day. For to vse outwardly, take these things following: fume the woman beneath with the horne of the Asses foote, which hath an hidden nature for to expell the fruit: but if so be that one can get no horne of the Asses foote, then is horne of a horses foote to be burnt. The same operation hath also the séed of Basilicum, if it be fumed and receiued beneath: likewise also the fume of Laudanum: or take Mirrha, Galbanum, and Beuercod, of each a like quantitie. One may also hold before the priuities swines bread, or cotten wooll made wet in the iuice of the same: and to put it before into the bodie is also maruellous good for this purpose. Item, take blacke Hellebore, Licebane, Hartwort, Coloquint and Ammoniacum, of each one quarter of an ounce, Oxe galles one ounce; the gum is to be dissolued in the water of Mugwort, afterwards temper the rest sodden well amongst it. Or take Opopanacum and Hartwort, of each a like quan∣titie, and make a plaister therof with the iuice of Mugwort: if it be too soft, then put a little waxe vnto it, and so lay it warme vpon it. Out of all these forementioned things may you also make pessaries, and put them into the bodie before. For this is also good the plaister de Galbano, whereof there be two kinds in the nine∣teenth chapter, third §. Another: Take vnkemmed shéepes wool, spread butter and hony vpon it, and apply it. Some do aduise to hold a Snakes skin to the priuities, for they say when it begin∣neth to warme, that nature will cause the dead fruite to follow presently. For this are also bathes prepared: Take Mints ten handfuls, séeth it in sufficient water, and sit therein vp to the nauell: this worketh maruellously, especially if thereupon be vsed the iuice of Swines bread as is before said: likewise doth also driue out a dead child, the plaister de Ra∣dicibus layd vpon it, and the decoction of Garlicke. A preparatiue for an easie child-birth and deliuerie. §. 12. AL creatures haue their certaine time of bearing except a woman onely, for that women may be deliuered of a child in the seuenth or eighth moneth, also in the ninth and tenth moneth, as we haue sufficiently written before: yea, it hath bin also found that they haue deferred both to the eleuenth moneth, and also some∣times to the twelfth moneth. It is also read of a woman that hapned to lie in of child in the thirtéenth moneth after that she had conceiued: yet it oftentimes co∣meth to passe that they be deceiued in their reckoning; therefore it is not néedful to dispute much of the time, for when the Peare is ripe (as is commonly said) then doth it fall off. Our purpose is
here onely to discourse and shew, through what meanes a fruitfull woman is to be prepa∣red, for to beare easily and with small paine. For because that on the child birth dependeth the maintenance of humane kind, and that women in their child birth are to expect all sundry mis∣haps, therefore haue many famous Phisitions thought thereon, and diligently studied, how fruitfull women might be prepared vnto their child birth, and therfore haue described these notable meanes: first, how the obstruction is to be opened, and how the paines are to be prouoked. Afterwards if a child in necessitie of birth, or deliuery chance to die, how the same shall be expelled, whereof also hath bene spoken in the former 11. §. and of other accidents moe which are to be expected after child birth. When as now the time of childbirth is at hand, & that a woman is almost past her reckning, then is she to eate and drinke well without excesse, and to vse such meates which might nourish well: viz. good Mutton, Veale, Hens, and Capons: all kind of field Foules, egs, good brothes, with spices, as with Cinnamom, Saffron, &c, and to drinke good wine. But she must especially take care, that she alwaies haue an open bodie: therewith she is to bath certain dayes together in this bath following: Take Hollihock rootes with the leaues two M. Mallowes and Betony of each one M. Mugwoort, Marioram, Mints and Cammomill, of each halfe a M. grosse beaten Linséede two M. make two bagges thereof, and seeth them in a great kettle with water: after∣wards let it be méetly cold, and then set the woman in it; the one bag must lie behind vpon her backe, and she must sit vpon the other, or hold it vpon the Nauell. After bathing, take oyle of sweet Almonds, of Lillies, and of Violets, of each halfe an ounce, Linséede, Hollihocke roots, Fenegréeke, Butter, and Hens grease, of each one quarter of an ounce, Quince kernels, and Dragagant, of each one ounce, you are to stampe the séeds, and cut the rootes: afterwards seeth all together in raine water, and take out the muscilage, temper the same with oyle, then let the powned Dragagant and Hens grease séeth so long vntill the muscilage be consumed, and then make a salue of it: with this salue are you to annoint warme beneath the whole backe, both the sides, and all the whole belly, euen to the priuities. Another: Take oyle of sweet Almonds, of Lillies, and of Violets, of each halfe an ounce, Ducks and Hens grease, of each three dragmes, white Waxe as much as is needfull: but if these salues cannot be gotten, then is oyle of Lillies alone to be vsed in their stead. Also this ensuing may be prepared: Take the muscilage of Linseede, and of Hollihock roots, fresh Butter, the grease of Hens, of Geese, and of Ducks; oile of Lillies, and of sweet Almonds, of each halfe an ounce; let them melt by the fire, and temper it well together. Or take Hollihock rootes with the leaues one handfull, cut it small; Venice sope one ounce and a halfe, and one pot of good fresh Beere, let it seeth together vnto the halfe, then will there be a Salue of it: with this foresaid salue is a woman to be annointed about her priuities fiue or sixe weekes be∣fore her time, euery day after bathing. These and such like meanes do open and soften the ob∣structions of the matrix: so that thereby in necessitie of birth, the throwes will not be so great, nor yet any thing like so painefull. When as now the time of childbirth and the throwes be instant: then may one choose of these things following, that which according to the importance of the cause is supposed to be most requisite, first of all outwardly. There be sundrie famous Phisitions which account it greatly auailable to hold certaine things before the priuities, or bind the hippe, with many strange ceremonies mo, which are therewith to be vsed. But if these kind of things happen without misbeliefe, and that amendment be found therby, then may they be taken for appro∣ued. Amongst the same things which seeme also to be like vnto the truth, are Agrimonie with the rootes holden before the Matrix, and immediatly after birth to cast it away, to the end that the Matrix be not drawne downe. Also Swines bread bounden vpon the thighs. Item: endane rootes, rootes of Polypodie, and of Bistorta, should also be very good for it: but what the Loadstone, Smaragde, the Eagles head, & Corall, (and chiefly if with the end wherwith it hath stood fast, it shall be turned toward the Matrix) may well helpe for childbirth: I cannot comprehend nor vnderstand it: therefore each one may hold and censure the same as he list. That which followeth hereafter, is more like to be true. Take the rootes of Polypodie, and Mallowes, of each one handfull, cut them small and seeth them very mellow, and lay them warme vpon the priuities: put also as much Mugwoort vnto it, whereof a woman shall pre∣sently fall in labour, and after deliuerie, it is immediatly to be taken away. The common peo∣ple
do commend to lay pouned Bayberries vpon the nauell. For to further birth therby, to take inwardly is much praised in time of this great néede, the rinds of Cassie, the vttermost being blacke scraped off, the weight of three quarters of an ounce, and beaten very smal, giuen to wo∣men with red Wine, or with the decoction of red Pease. Item: Saffron drunke with Wine, helpeth also much to very spéedie birth, and to diminishing of the paine. The same doth also Ci∣namom drunke with wine. Item, take Boreas and Cassie pipes scraped well, stampe them very small, and temper them, and giue thereof one dragme, or one dragme and a half, it is very forcible. There is also good for this that which is described in the 19. Chapter and 2. §. for pre∣ferment of the Tearmes, like as is also that which is discouered for the expulsion of a dead child. Item, take Hony one spoonfull, put two spoonfuls of water vnto it, and giue it to drinke: Fenegreeke decocted with Hony is also very good for it: in like sort do the common people com∣mend for it very highly the decoction of red Pease, or Cicers drunken. Take also Beuercod, Asarabacca, of each one dragme powned small, and giue it with the decoction of red Peason. In this manner also may be vsed the séede of Siluermountaine. This insuing is commended for a forcible and sure powder méete for this purpose. Take good Cinnamom and Myrrhe, of each halfe a dragme, giue it with small white Wine, it is espe∣ciall good if a woman haue once snéezed, or hath once vomited. Take Cinnamom one dragme, Saffron halfe a dragme, Cassie wood, and scraped Cassie pipes, of each two scruples; stampe it very small, and giue it foure or fiue times with the de∣coction of red Pease: Or take Myrrhe, Beuercod, red Storax, of each halfe a scruple, Cinna∣mom, and Sauin trée, of each halfe a scruple, giue it so vnto women to drinke, or make pilles thereof: this is commended aboue all other things, as this also following, is: Take Myrrha, rootes of Costus, and red Storax, of each halfe a dragme, Ammoniacum, Sauin trée, of each half a dragme; stampe them very small, and giue it three or foure times with the decoction of red Pease: of this also may you make pils. For this is also good Triphera magna one dragme, or one dragme and a halfe, for it maketh women not vnfruitfull, as some women do falsly report, but doth aduance fruitfulnes. Some do aduise, when a woman is past her time, that her mother veine or Saphaea vpon the foote is to be opened, for that the birth will thereby be the easier, and it cleanseth also the child, but how farre this is from the opinion of the auncient Phisitions, we haue sufficiently declared before. Other do aduise to seeth a Swallowes nest in water, and straine it through a cloth, and then to take foure ounces thereof, it will accelerate the birth. The fume also of a Mules fell, of Comin, of Colewoort stalkes, of Myrrh, of Mirtle, of Stéeres gall (which one will) receiued beneath, but aboue all Beuercod, and Assa foetida. Some say, that one should giue one spoonfull or twaine of the iuice of Sloes, and alleage also therewith, that it is not to be taken but when a child is readie to be deliuered. But we haue here many better and most apparant things. When the throwes do not continue in bearing women. §. 13. ALl that hath a strong odoriferous sauour, as Muscus, and such like, is to be kept from women with child, and to be taken away, for that it doth hold backe the throwes, and hindereth the birth or deliuerie. But for to aduance birth, take Betonie three handfuls, Mugwoort one handfull, Cammomill, Penniroyall, and Hyssops, of each one handfull, Linséede grossely beaten two handfuls, cut all the herbes and fill a bag with it, let it séeth well in wine and water. This being done, then foment with this decoction the priuities with a sponge fiue or sixe times, after∣wards annoynt the place with the oyle of Wal-flowers into the neck of the mother, if so be that the same can be conueniently done by the Midwife, whereby the woman will be stronger, and the birth be aduanced, especially if the child be rightly placed. And if so be that this will not yet helpe, then make this potion following, and giue her therof a good draught euery two houres: Take Betonie one handfull, Mugwoort, Penniroyall, and Hyssope of each halfe a handfull, a pint of Rhenish wine, or somewhat more: let them séeth to∣gether vntill about the fourth part be consumed: straine it, wring it out, and put vnto it halfe a dragme of Saffron. Amongst each draught is to be put halfe a dragme of this powder follo∣wing: Take of the blacke scraped Cassie pipes one dragme, and make a subtill powder thereof,
in like sort haue you yet moe before. This following wil be also much commended: take white beaten Amber half a drag. & giue it with the water of Lillies, or with the decoction of red pease: it quickeneth mightily the throwes. It doth also chaunce sometimes that the throwes do auoid at the mouth: for which, take thrée or foure skeanes of boyled warme linnen yae, and let the woman with child receiue this vapor: for thereby will the throwes fall downwards: euery one may conceiue thereof what he list, it is very like a grosse medicine for clownes. Of the perillous and hard Child birth in generall. §. 14. IT is knowne to all the world more than sufficiently, how hard and sowre that some women lye in labour, before that they can auoid the child and secundine; so that it hapneth otherwhiles that young and strong women do die with the fruite. These perils haue many occasions, so that otherwhiles the women themselues, or the child be a cause thereof. Such anguish may also procéede otherwhiles from the Matrix, or from the necke of the same. In like manner the same may be well caused through some obstruction of the Matrix, or through any other disease, as an impostume and such like, in the foresaid parts: this also may be brought to passe through the rudenesse and vnhandsomnesse of the Midwife. When as these foresaid reasons be declared, then may the cause easily be adiudged of this grie∣uous and perillous child birth. If the disease be of the woman, then hath she had a great former sicknesse, or she is diseased through hunger: she may be also too young, and haue conceiued before the due age: or she may be too old, or not haue borne before at any time, in which the places will be hardly opened: also if a woman be dismayed, or neuer wont to beare child, be also too fat of bodie, and is ouercooled, then can she hardly be deliuered of the child. Secondly, the fruit it self may cause also a grieuous labour, like as is said (yet without foundation) that boyes be easier borne into the world than girles. Item, if the child be too grosse of bodie or head, and therewith be very small and weake, that through his féeblenesse it cannot help it self to the birth. Item, if the child be dead, haue two heads, or the like double members. Item, if the child with his hands and féet, and not with the head, doth lie in the birth place like as behooueth, and as is naturall. Further, the Matrix may be by nature too narrow or too drie, so that with no moisture the passage can be made slipperie. Item, if the woman before in the necke of the matrix haue had any exulceration, whereby the muskles could not stretch abroad, or that as yet there be some vlcer in the neck of the mother: or if it cometh by the secundine, then is the same so thicke and so strong, that it will not breake. This grieuous and very hard labour may also be caused by the stopping of the bodie. If now this heauy labor do procéede of the forementioned diseases, sicknesses, hunger & such like outward causes, that may be very well perceiued of the woman. The signes of a féeble or dead child are to be found in the 8. & 11. §. But if there be of none of all these signes any instant, and if that a woman is not strong, and that a child in deliuerie remaine in the birth place, and cannot be brought into the world, then is it a certaine signe that the afterbirth (like as is said) is too strong and not yet broken. Thus be all perillous accidents of childbirth so ioyned to each other, that all of them for the most part are cured with one kind of remedie, whereof we haue written much before. And be∣cause we haue especially admonished here of the secundine, therfore doth our old order require, that we should also discourse somewhat particularly therof. But because nature obserueth this method, that it first expelleth the child, and afterwards the Secundina, which is the secundine, therefore we will also first of all write perfectly of the child, and afterwards of the secundine, with all which is ordained for the same. Lastly, we will shew and declare all that is méete for both of them. When a woman cannot be deliuered of a child. §. 15. THe causes of this hard and longsome childbirth are before sufficiently discouered: when as then a child appeareth with a hand or a foote before, which doth happē very seldome without swelling of the necke of the matrix, and of the parts adiacent, then take Penniroyall, Mugwoort, and browne Betonie, of each a like quantitie, hack it all together, and let it séeth in milke, lay it then vnder her, before the birth, as warm as she may abide it, about the member of the child, yt same driueth away the swelling: or set séething water
vnder it, when the child féeleth the warmth, then doth it draw the member back againe. This and the like things shold Midwiues know, on whose knowledge and experience, is very much depending, yt very renowned aduice which is discouered in the 13. §. of Amber, when ye throwes will not continue: also there is laid vnto it scraped Vnicornes horne. Some be of opinion that first of all the woman should take a spoonfull of oyle, with twice as much water. Other do also aduise, that one should séeth halfe a drag. of Mace, and so giue it: this forceth also ye secundine. If that then a child will not frame himself to birth in his mothers wombe, and neuertheles the throwes & the right time of birth be instant, then take a litle Lilly water, and as much good Rhe∣nish wine, & so drinke it together, it will frame it self the better afterwards. For this is also good the iuice of Sloes, whereof we haue spoken before. Another: Take fresh well water, and hony as much as you please, temper them together without séething or skumming, and so giue it to drink, this quickneth the throwes & paine, so that she wil be the sooner deliuered of child, for that the paine expelleth the child and the secundine. Or take the flowers of Cypers, seeth them in wine, and drinke a good draught thereof, this should be very certaine, especially if the herbe or flowers may be gotten fresh. Item, take well powned Linseede, seeth the same in wine, & giue the woman a good draught therof. In like maner may she well drinke wine, which is decocted with Plantaine. Wine wherein Vine leaues haue bene stéeped, shold also expel birth. Boreas the waight of half a drag. drunken with wine, is also very aduancing for it, as we haue admonished before. A stronger: Take Saffron, and Pearles of each one scrup. Boreas 4. scrup. giue this also with hony water if the throwes come not; but if so be that the throwes be instant, then giue it with Mugwoort water, or with swéet wine, it expelleth very swiftly. Now for to vse outwardly may one chuse out of these things following for a time that which one will, as the séeds of Gar∣lick, Sauintrée, Mugwoort, S. Iohns woort, Pigeon dung, the horne of an Asses foote, or of a horses foote, Oxe dung, Wormwood & Rue: of all which tempered, or each alone: also to bathe, to make salues, plaisters, & such like. Item, take round Hartwoort, Aristologie, Sauin trée and Cresses, of each a like, stampe and temper them all together with an Oxe gall: then afterwards make a great taint moist therin, and put it before into the places, it helpeth much to birth. This following doth also expell a child whether it be liuing or dead, and also the secundine very ve∣hemently: Take Sauintrée, round Hartwort, Asarabacca, & Dragon roots, of each a like quan∣titie, powne them all together, & temper them with hony: afterwards giue to the woman ther∣of the waight of one quarter of an ounce, with water wherein Lupins be decocted, and if so be that this expell not sufficiently, then take Opopanacum, and Oxe gall, of each one quarter of an ounce, Beuercod one dragme, giue it to the woman to drinke with water wherein the Sauin∣tree and Fennell is decocted: and although all these foresaid medicines be meete and conuenient for to expell the secundine with them, yet we will neuerthelesse in particular as we haue pro∣mised write, and discourse thereof. Of the secundine or afterbirth, and how the same is to be expelled. §. 16. THis afterbirth do the Latinists call Secundinam, which is as much to say, as the second, because it commeth away after that she is deliuered of child, and of such like, wherefore it is by vs properly called the afterbirth or secundine. This foresaid afterbirth or secundine hath this vse, to wit, when that in lying together both the séedes of the man & woman be tempe∣red in the Matrix, and become like vnto milke, then commeth about the same a caule or velme, which groweth by little and little with the fruit, and is augmented with it. The same is by na∣ture ordained, that the fruite may be therewith, as it were with a cloth couered, enclosed about, garded and defended, vntill the day of the birth, which presently after the birth of the child (if all things happen aright) doth auoide; or remaining behind, it bringeth very great perill with it, as we haue said before, that amongst other accidents there do follow agues, stinking breath, paine of the head, swouning and such like. If in case then that these afterbirths do thereby tarrie behind, for that a woman is waxen too weary & féeble, through ye former hard labor, then must somwhat be giuen her, wherby she may get some strength, and might comfort her hart, as Diamargariton, Manus Christi, and Diapliris. She is also to be caused to neese, and to hold in her breath, wherby the vndermost parts of the belly be pressed down, and stirred vp to expel that which remaineth. And if so be that the secun∣dine will not follow, then let the woman rest a litle, and annoint the belly and al other parts a∣bout
it with oyle of Lillies, and oyle of Elderne flowers: also to kéep the belly very warme, and then to vse those things which are specified in the deliuerie of children in the 11. §. & also what∣soeuer shall be prescribed hereafter. All those that esteeme much of precious stones do counsell, that when the afterbirth will not follow, that then to the woman is to be giuen of the powder of the Aggat, and that thereupon the secundine must follow. It is also commanded to the con∣trarie, that whensoeuer a woman is in labour, that then she is to put away from her all man∣ner of precious stones, because that they do deferre this childbirth. It is also said that corne flowers giuen with Lilly water, do expell the secundine. We haue also said before, that halfe an Eg-shell full of the iuice of Garlicke giuen with Hony water, doth expell the dead child and afterbirth: but this aduice may we leaue for country people. Néesing is also especiall good for deliuerie and auoyding of the afterbirth. For to vse outward things therefore is much commended to make a ley of ashes, and to set the feete déepe in them, they should draw the afterbirth downwards. Item, take Béech ashes, and powre séething water vnto it, then let the vapor ascend from beneath vpwards, and the af∣terbirth will follow. Take Peacocks feathers, or if you cannot get them, then take Hens fea∣thers, kindle them, and let the fume ascend from beneath. Item, take Hollihocke rootes, séeth them very mellow, and then temper it with Barrowes grease, with Goose grease, and therewith annoint the necke of the Matrix within. This draw∣eth not onely ye afterbirth but also all other vncleannes: for this is also chiefly good whatsoeuer before is described for the aduancement and lightning of childbirth, & also for womens termes. How that the afterthrowes are to be eased. §. 17. TAke Squinant and Spikenard, of each one quarter of an ounce, séeth them together with water of Mugwoort euen to the halfe, and drinke thereof two or thrée times, it allayeth the paine. Item, take Malmsey, or some other good wine, and make a candle thereof with the yolkes of Egs and Cinnamom. Or take Saffron half a drag. Mace one scrup. Triphera magna halfe an ounce, take this at two times with warme wine, for this Triphera hath such power, that it doth presently asswage the paine. In like manner, this may be annointed in the necke of the Matrix very commodiously. Further, you haue be∣fore in the 19. Chapter and 7. §. of the paine of the Matrix through wind, of Triphera and Phi∣lonium, and presently afterwards a powder with Turbith. Also how this Hellebore is to be vsed, all which things be very commodious for the afterthrowes. Item, take small powned Woolblade, temper them as a dough, and bake cakes thereof, and giue it to the woman to eate. Take good fat Figs, cut them to péeces, and grosse beaten Fene∣gréeke, of each one handfull; let them séeth together, and the woman to sit oftentimes ouer it, or to foment her beneath with clothes. Item, take the yolkes of Egges, temper them with the iuice of Mugwoort, and bake cakes thereof, and lay them behind vpon the backe. The same doth also Hollihock rootes, or the leaues, if it be beaten, and with warme wine laid vpon it, and of∣tentimes renewed. For the excessiue floud after birth. §. 18. FOr this you haue before in the 19. Chapter 3. §. of ye asswaging of the excessiue termes of women many kinds of remedies which be also very méete for all wo∣men in childbed. Yet of the Phisitions of Augusta be these following ordained for very especiall remedies: At the first are these women in childbed (be it how∣soeuer it will) to take with broth fasting one dragme of the same powder with white Diptamus, that not long since hath bene described in the 11. §. After∣wards she is to vse this costly confection: Take conserue of Roses one ounce, conserue of Bur∣rage, of Buglosse, and of Baulme, of each halfe an ounce prepared Bolus halfe a drag. prepared Pearles one drag. good Cinnamom one drag. and a halfe, temper them all together. Item, take conserue of Pionie, it cleanseth a woman after birth. Let her vse also this powder following: Take prepared Bolus one drag. Sealed earth 2. scru. Tormentill halfe a drag. Shepheards purse one scrup. Species de gemmis frigidis one drag. and a halfe, prepared Pearles one drag. Roses, Co∣rall, and Saunders, of each one scrup. Cinnamom two scrup. and a halfe, Sugar thrée ounces, temper them well together, and take it with Henbroth. This following is yet more forcible in
stanching: Take Bloudstone washed with Plantaine water one dragme and a halfe, red Coral one drag. Tormentill and Trociscos de spodio, of each halfe a dragme, scraped Iuorie, and burnt Harts horne, of each one scrup. prepared Pearles foure scruples, fine Bolus two scruples, Bursa Pastoris, and red Saunders, of each a scrup. Cinnamom one dragme, Sugar sixe ounces, make a powder thereof or losinges. Of the superfluitie of milke. §. 19. VVHen as now a woman is deliuered of Child, and that the milke so excessiuely a∣bounded and ran ouer that the child could not sufficiently suck or draw it out, and it were to be feared that it might come thereby to clot or to impostumate, then must good remedies be sought, to which end diuers be described in the second part, the third Chapter and 5. §. Of diuers other accidents after the birth. §. 20. IT hapneth many times that a woman after that she is deliuered of child, her legs and féete happen to swell. For this, take Wormewood, Cammomill, Centorie, Yarrow, Southernwood, and Spikenard, of each a like quantitie, seeth it all toge∣ther to a bath for the feete, and vse it oftentimes. In like manner you haue also be∣fore in the third Part and fift Chapter, in the description of the places in women and their acci∣dents, diuers things which be méete for this purpose. Item, take Cammomill and Linséede, of each one handfull, put them in a bag together, and séeth them in wine, afterwards lay it ouer the swelling. Or take a great Onion, rost the same in ashes, afterwards stampe it to a grout, and make a plaister thereof with sufficient butter, and vse it. These two last things may also be laid vpon the belly against the afterthrowes. As much as then concerneth the descension of the necke of the Matrix, the vnnaturall heate, the ach, and such like accidents which women in childbed be subiect to, for that are diuers re∣medies to be found before in the description of the places, neuerthelesse we will adde somewhat more, and therewith conclude. If so be that a woman with child come to be broken, then take Comfery foure handfuls, Self-heale one handfull: séeth them together for a bath for the loynes, and let her sit therein o∣uer the priuities. Item, take a long péece of Allume, and put it into the bodie before, then shall the rupture go together againe, and the entrance will be so narrow as euer it was before. Or take two ounces of Coperas, foure ounces of gals, one ounce and a halfe of Gum, séeth them together in sufficient raine water, and wash you therewith, but this is none other but as it were a right writing Inke. Looke also further, the first Chapter of the third Part of the ruptures of the nauel, and al that which shall be written of the ruptures, where one may chuse what séemeth best for euery one. The plaister Diachilon, whereof we haue so oftentimes admonished, is thus to be made: Take Fenegréeke, Linséede, and Hollihocke rootes, of each foure ounces, séeth them together, & draw out the muscilage, as in the first Part, the third Chapter, and 7. §. is taught: put thereto nine ounces of Sallad oyle, Litharge of gold thrée ounces, then séeth them together again vntil the muscilage be spent, and make a plaister thereof: this plaister mllifieth all hardnesse of the liuer, of the milt, and stomacke, and of all other parts. There be also two sorts prepared, which are called Compositum, and Magnum, which be both also more stronger than the former, but they be not so much in vse. There hath also oftentimes bene spoken of the sirupe De radicib. the one called of two kinds of rootes, which is thus made: Take Parsly rootes, and Fennell rootes, of each two ounces, let them seeth in sufficient water, afterwards straine them through a cloth, and make a clarified sirupe thereof with twelue ounces of Sugar. The sirupe of fiue kinds of rootes is prepared in this manner: Take the rootes of Smallage, of Fennell, of Parsly, of Ruscus, and of Sperage, of each one ounce, seeth them very mellow, and then make a sirupe thereof with twelue ounces of Sugar. Both these kinds of sirupes be good against all kind of Agues which proceed through putrifaction of phlegme and choler.
The fourth Part of this generall Practise of Phisicke, doth intreat of the outward members. ALthough the Phisitions, and especially the Anatomists do compre∣hend all other parts of mans bodie, which be not described in the former thrée parts of this Practise of Phisicke, in this fourth Part; yet will we diuide them into two principall parts: that is, the Armes and Legges. These be the especiallest outward parts, to wit, armes, hands, fingers, and nailes: afterwards the legs, the thighs, the knées, the shins, the ankles, the feete and the toes. These be now the diseases which be generally incident to both these parts. First, that which the Phisitions do call Gutta, and we the Gout, is diui∣ded into foure principall Chapters, according to the member which is infected with it, viz. Arthritis, which is the right Goute: Chiragra, which is the Gout in the hands: Ischia, the Sciaticke: lastly, Podagra the Goute of the feete. Of all which we will order∣ly discourse and write, afterwards of Eluxations, Elocations, Extenuations, Bruises, and fractures of bones, and by what meanes each disease is to be holpen. Therefore will we in the name of God begin according to our old custome and method, with the highest parts, which be the Armes, and what is annexed vnto them. Of the Armes. Chap. 1. §. 1. THese Armes be diuided into thrée parts. First, they haue their beginning at the shoulder blade with the Armepits, reaching vnto the Elbow. All which with the other parts of the Armes be called by the Grecians and Latinists Brachium. The second part reacheth foorth vnto the hands and wrests of the armes: the third part is ye hand vnto the end of the fingers. As much as concerneth now the first two parts. They be subiect vnto all outward and inward accidents or diseases; as bruises, fractures, wounds, impostumations, eluxations, diseases of the veines, and of the sinewes, and to such like accidents mo. All which diseases (according to the qualitie of the cause) are to be holpen with letting of bloud, salues, plaisters, baths, fomentations, &c. where∣of in many places before, and also shortly hereafter in the Goute and in the Sciatica shall be more ample declaration made: so that at this present it is néedlesse to write any further therof. Of the Armepits. §. 2. AS much as concerneth this part of the armes, we haue thereof sufficiently spo∣ken before, as also of the veines of the Armpits, and for what cause they ought to be opened, hath bene sufficiently declared in the Introduction, we will here discouer and discourse of the lothsome stench of the armepits, and chiefly in hote and fat folks: because that they haue also much haire in this place, and be moist of nature; and how nearer that the stench is to the nose, so much the lothsomer is it. This stench is augmented through great labour at hot times, through want of shifting and alteration of clothes, through great incontinencie, and through some corrupted humors of the body. Which stench if it do continue very long, it is a sure signe of an incident palsey. Then for to remedie this stench, it is néedfull (according to the quality of the person) that all such are to be purged and let bloud, and that they afterwards do bath in these odoriferous herbes, as Mints, Melilot, Lauander, Ireos, and such like. This being done, the Ameholes and the whole bodie are to be fomented with these things following: Take Annis, Comin, & Roses, of each 2 ounces, Cipers roots one ounce, Spiknard, & Spica Romana, of each one quarter of an ounce, powned Ireas one ounce: séeth these all together
in two quarts of water vntill about a third part be consumed; & then vse it warme with clothes wet therein, and keepe the bodie very cleane with clothes and linnen. Afterwards vse some of these things following: Take the Litharge of gold one quarter of an ounce, Allume one drag. Roses and Myrrhe, of each half a drag. beate them all to powder, and wash the Armpits with wine; and then strew the powder vpon it: the Litharge of gold doth the same of it selfe tempe∣red with Rosewater: in like manner also the Myrrhe. Item, take Coperas one ounce, séeth the same in three ounces of water, let it be cold, and annoint the stinking place with it. Take Thi∣stle leaues one handfull, seeth the same in a pint of wine and drinke thereof, it taketh away the stench throughout the whole bodie. Item, take litharge of gold one ounce, Frankinsence halfe an ounce, powne all together small when you go to bed, and temper a little thereof with wine, and annoint therewith the place, and then in the morning wash it with Vineger. You may also vse for this the oyle of Spike. And if so be that the humors then be so sharp that they excoriate the place and bite open the skin, then wash it with warme water, and afterwards strew the place with burnt Allume. Marmalade with spices doth also expell all stench. Of the hands. §. 3. ANaxagoras was wont to say, yt men aboue all creatures were most reasonable, for that they only had hands. But Aristotle contrarieth this with great reasons, and saith, because that mankind is the most sharp witted amongst al creatures, therefore hath nature giuen him hands, which be none other than instruments of a reasonable creature for to vse them wherto he desireth, so yt these most noble and necessarie members be made for to comprehend, to hold, to cast, and to la∣bour, &c. In like manner also through their féeling to adiudge all that is hard, soft, hote, cold, thin, thicke, and such like. Besides this, in stead of all weapons wherewith all other beasts be indued, that they may therby seize vpon all manner of weapons wherewith either in time of peace or warre to guard and defend the bodie. Item, with these hands be all renowned feates and cunning, and also all hurtful works atchieued and brought to passe, as is daily séene. It ap∣peareth also by daily experience, that commonly the right side is more forcible and much nim∣bler than the left, not that it is so in euery bodie, or must be, for that it is oftentimes found to the contrarie, whether it be through the custome or otherwise, that some do most of all helpe themselues with the left hand, and be much nimbler and actiuer with it. Further, the hand is commonly deuided into two parts, as the palme, the fingers, and one may if he will accompt the nailes with it. They be filled euery where full of sinewes, wherewith they most commodiously and speedily be readie to all manner of actions. Inwardly in the palme of the hand be many kinds of lines or strakes séene, the which like as the Chiro∣mantici do say, be signes of good and bad luck or fortune, wherof we will not here write any fur∣ther, because that these Southsayers art is by many learned regarded as lies, for that they haue no foundation, therefore be they also iustly to be mocked and scorned, like as they be also taken and acknowledged of all vpright Christians to be vngodly, and adiudged to be an illu∣sion of Sathan. Thus may this suffise of the Hands. For to keepe the hands cleane. §. 4. IT becommeth all men very well with honestie, that they haue alwaies cleane hands, and that chiefly when they sit at table, whether it be that they tast any meate, or carue for others: and for to come vnto it, the same are oftentimes to be washed with faire water, and Venice sope. If you will make them smel wel, then looke what is written thereof in the first Part, in the first Chapter, nd 2. §. Or prepare in stead of the sope this ensuing: Take one spoonfull of Hony, two yolks of Egs well brayed, and a litle Rosewater, and Lilly water▪ temper them, and séeth them to pap, rub the hands therewith and afterwards wash it off with faire water. Item, take the whites of Egs well brayed, stirre therein a litle wheaten flowre, Rose water,
and Orange péels powned small as much as you will. The iuice of Citrons is also very good for it: or if one cannot get it, then may the iuice of Limons or of Oranges be taken in stead of it. Let the same séeth alone in a glased pot, and stirre it about continually. It is also especiall good against all itchinesse of the hands, and all other parts of the bodie. Or take the water of Louage, and powned Argall, temper them together with the white of an Egge, as much as you please of each, bray them well together, and vse them as before is specified. For to make perfumed hands and gloues. §. 5. TAke clean Barrows grease as much as you please, and lay the same eight daies in water or in lye, putting euery day fresh water or lye vnto it, and wash it well. Afterwards fiue other daies in fresh milke, washed also daily. Then after that wring it out cleane, and put it into a pot, and put Rose water vnto it, the water of Elderne flowers, of Plantaine, and of Lauander, of each a like quan∣titie. Afterwards put odoriferous spices vnto it, as Cloues, Cinnamon, Nut∣megs, and so let them seeth together softly vntill the water be wasted away. At the last you are to put vnto it Muscus, Ambra, golden waters, or any other well sauoring things, stirre them a long time well together. This salue is also good for all scabbinesse and scurfe, &c. For scabby Hands. §. 6. FOr this may the foresaid salue or Pomander be vsed which is described in the first Part, the tenth Chapter, and first §. For this is also very good the Gum of Dragagant dissolued in Rosewater, and the hands rubbed with it. It happeneth also many times that the hands be full of the drie scurfe, like to that kind of itch which the Latinists do call Impetiginem: for which this following is to be vsed, and not onely for the hands, but also ouer the whole bodie, where as is the drie scurffe. Open some egs, put out the whites and yolkes, the egge shels are to be laid in a coole place where they will not be bedusted, then will there gather amongst it a little water, which you are to put into a little glasse, and to annoint therewith the place that is scabby. Item, séeth Elecampane in the creame of milke, which is also very méete for this purpose. Or séeth these rootes with Butter and Milke; and when they be mellow and sodden to pappe, then temper some Salt amongst it, this is alwaies found to be very good. You haue a sure salue for this before in the first Part, the third Chapter, and tenth §. beginning thus: Take Turpen∣tine, &c. Some do aduise to take the lyuers of Tenthes, and to put the same in a glasse stopped tight and set in a warme place, and to annoint it with the water that commeth thereof. Item, the iuice which is wrung out of Orange péeles, should be maruellous good for this purpose. Another: Take the oyle of Iuniper, and oyle of Argall, annoint the hands with it and all other scabbinesse. For chops in the Hands. §. 7. TAke foure ounces of Sallad oyle, or oyle of Roses, Waxe one ounce; melt them together and annoint the hands with it. Item: Take oyle of Roses, white Waxe, Masticke, Frankinsence, and Hennes grease, of each a like quantitie; powne all that is to be powned, then temper them all together, and make a soft salue of it. For itchie or scabbie hands. §. 8. TAke thrée ounces of swéet Butter, Turpentine two ounces washed together cer∣taine times with Vineger; and then temper with it halfe an ounce of salt, and thrée drag. of drie Ceruse. Item, take a good peece of Rie bread, laying it the space of cer∣taine howers in fresh water vntill it be well mollified, then wring it out through a course cloth, and wash your selfe therewith.
This following is also good and sure. Take Turpentine two ounces, fresh butter one ounce, oyle of Roses halfe an ounce, the iuice of Limons or Oranges thrée quarters of an ounce, and the white of an Egge well brayed, salt one dragme, then temper them all together with a mild fire or vpon warme ashes. If so be that you will haue it thicker, then put a litle Waxe vnto it. Or take the middlemost rinds of the Iuniper trée, and Barrowes grease, of each a like much: séeth the same together in Goates milke, and salt it well. Take the oyle of Roses and liquid Storax, of each a like quantitie, melt them together: this is especiall good, and hath a good sauour. Item, take fresh Elecampane rootes, Mallowes Dock rootes with the leaues, and Fumitory, of each one handfull: Branne one handfull; séeth them all together in thrée pints of water vnto the halfe, and therewith wash the hands. Or take Sul∣phur vife halfe an ounce, small brused Litharge of siluer thrée dragmes, dried Ceruse one quar∣ter of an ounce, Barrowes grease one ounce, Camfere halfe a dragme, the iuice of Oranges halfe an ounce, temper them together and kéepe it in a glasse. With this following be many people holpen whom nothing would helpe. Take the rootes of Dockes and Elecampane, of each one ounce, Cuckoopit and Comfery, of each halfe an ounce, Agrimonie, Self-heale and broad Plantaine, of each one handfull, Vitrioll half an ounce, Al∣lume and Sulphur vife, of each one ounce, Saltpeter one quarter of an ounce, Roses one hand∣full, Pomegranate pils halfe a handfull, wine and water, of each one quart, sharpe Vineger twelue ounces; let it be all together infused, and then afterwards boyle it: in which are the hands to be bathed euery morning and euening the space of sixe dayes. And afterwards be the hands to be moistened with a cloth dipped in this decoction following: Take washt Ceruse one dragme and a halfe, Allume, white Coperas, and Masticke, of each two scruples, Camfere half a dragme: this being all beaten small together, then bind it in a fine cloth, afterwards stéepe it in two ounces of Rosewater, and foure ounces of Plantaine water, wherof we haue admoni∣shed before and taught in the former 6. §. As much as now concerneth all itch or scurfe, thereof we will by Gods helpe speake suffici∣ently in the fift part. Of the Fingers. §. 9. IN the last 6. §. we haue generally writen of the hands: but now will we think vpon the fingers, which be called by the Grecians Dactyli, and by the Latinists Digiti, by nature haue all men fiue on each hand: Othersome sixe which be ther∣fore called by the Latinists Sedigiti. The first of these is the Thumbe, which is called the greatest and smallest; but by reason of his shortnes is he verily the smallest, but by reason of his thicknes and strength is he indéed the greatest, and therewithall so forcible, that he is a helper to the rest of the fingers, that without the same they be very impotent, because that he lying aboue ye fingers in holding fast, shutteth them vp. This haue also the most cruell tyrants acknowledged, who commaunded to chop off the Captiues thumbes and not their hands, to the end that they might not handle their weapon, nor do any other labour. The first finger afterwards is called the forefinger, in Latine Index, that we do therewith shew and point at all things. The third do we name by reason of his place, the mid∣dlemost, which the Latinists partly call Infamem: the cause of this name wil we conceale at this present. The fourth is the gold finger or Anularis, for that commonly the same is wont to be garnished and deckt with gold rings. Lastly followeth the small or eare finger. These fiue fin∣gers haue fiftéene bones, each thrée; albeit some do ascribe to ye thumbe but two bones. Through these bones and mouing of the sinewes, these fingers haue two small ioynts, amongst which the thumbe hath no more but one: all which bend onely inwards, whereby they be méete for all cunning and subtill actions. But what mischances and diseases these parts be subiect to, we wil now write and discourse thereof. Of the numbnesse of the fingers in part or in all. §. 10. THis numbnes bringeth with it a hardening of the sinewes, & is caused through heat, cold, or drith: this numbnesse must be holpen immediatly, or the fingers will forthwith lose
their motion thereby. For this disease must be kept especially a good diet, and first of all are cold windie dwellings to be eschued, and the whole bodie, chiefly the hands and the feete to be kept very warm, and then to refraine from all grosse binding and cooling meats, as old Béefe, Skins, Paunches and Sinewes of all beasts. Item, all that is drest with dough, all fish, and especially Eeles, Tenches, and Crabs must he refraine. He must also forbeare Milke, Cheese, and all old baked bread: from all kind of Beanes, and from cold herbs, as Lettice, Purslaine, Béets, Pears, and such like, red grosse thicke wine is also not good for him: and if it be possible he is vtterly to refraine wine, whether it be drunken watered or vnwatered. Also he is not to ouercharge him∣selfe with meate or drinke at any hand. And he is aboue all to beware of Vineger, and from all sowre things. Also long sléepe is hurtfull for him, and especially sleepe by day; otherwise he may liue according to his old custome. As much as concerneth the vse of Phisicke, he may take of these pils following foure or fiue euery day two houres alwaies before supper, and to continue this a certaine space: Take Aloe two ounces, steepe it two daies in the water of blew Flower-deluce, Agaricus, and Turbith, of each one dragme and a halfe, Hermodactyli one quarter of an ounce, Mastick one scruple, Gin∣ger, Annis, Cinnamom, and Mace of each halfe a scruple, Diagridij two scruples, then powned all small temper them together, and fashion sixe pils of each dragme. Secondly, take oyle of Myrtles, and of Masticke, of each one ounce and a halfe, burnt Iuory, Amber, red Corall, and Sandaraca, of each one dragme, Masticke, Frankinsence, of each halfe a dragme, Paper glue three quarters of an ounce, Dragagant and Gum, of each halfe a dragme, dissolue the glew in strong red vineger, with halfe an ounce of Waxe. When it is almost cold, then temper the other spices with it, and make a tough salue of it, that it may be spread on lea∣ther, lay it within vpon the bending of the hand, and round about the thumbe. Thirdly, take a péece of a Milstone, let it be thorough hote, lay it in a great panne and be∣sprinkle it with good Wine and sharpe Vineger tempered together: and do this so long vntill there be about twelue ounces powred vpon it. Ouer this vapor be the hands to be holden being well couered, to the end that they may sweate well; afterwards drie them. This is to be done ounce euery morning, and afterwards to bind vp the hands in a péece of Furre. Fourthly, take oyle of Camelina, and of swéet Almonds, of each two ounces, Calues mar∣row, Badgers grease, Ducks grease, of each one ounce, Bdcllium halfe an ounce, Galbanum one ounce and a quarter, Saffron halfe a drag. dissolue the gum in white Vineger, and then make a soft salue of it with Waxe: with this salue are you to annoint all the hands and fingers mor∣ning and euening. Fiftly, take one ounce of the gum of a Cherrie trée, Beuercod and Galbanum, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sallad oyle sixe ounces, Calues marrow, Goose grease, and Hens grease, of each one ounce, white Waxe one ounce and a halfe, Saffron two scruples, Lignum Aloes halfe a dragme, and Muscus two graines: dissolue the Gum in white Vineger, and temper the fatte amongst it. Last of all, put all the other things beaten small vnto it. When as the patient hath vsed all these foresaid fomentations, salues, and plaisters, the space often or twelue dayes, then are the hands to be annointed with the first described salue. When the Fingers be numbed through bruises. §. 11. THis cure or healing is commonly committed to the Chirurgians: but if the si∣newes be not vtterly chopt off, then is there still some hope of health. Now for to remedie this, the patient is (like as is said alreadie) to kéepe himself soberly, and to beware of much Wine, of Vineger, and Venery. From stirring the brui∣sed hand too much, and not to wash them with cold water; but is to vse these fo∣mentations following: Take a péece of a Milstone, make it very hote, and put vnto it as is before said, then couer the hands very warme. This being done, then are they to be annointed with this salue being made very warme: Take oyle of Bhen, of Costus, and ye suet or fat of a Lion, or in stead therof mans grease, the fat of a Beuer of each fiue ounces, Saffron two scruples, the marrow of an Oxe one ounce, powned Hermodactyli, Pionie rootes, Stechas flowers, and Southernwood of each halfe a dragme, Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make a tough salue. This being done, then be the hands to be couered warme with vnkemmed sheeps
wool, and the brused fingers are to be bounden and to be put into warme gloues, to the end they may be kept from all maner of cold. When as this hath bene obserued the space of eight daies, then is the fomentation to be omitted, and to vse this salue following: Take oyle of Nar∣dus one ounce and a halfe, oyle of Euphorbium one ounce, oyle of Saffron, and of Pepper, of each halfe an ounce, Stechas, Swines bread, white Pepper, Hermodactyli, Pionie rootes, and Sou∣thernwood, of each one dragme, Galbanum, Serapinum, and Ammoniacum, of each one quarter of an ounce; seeth the oyle and the gum easily together. When it beginneth to be cold, then tem∣per the powder in it, and make a salue of it, wherwith annoint the hands twice a day, and kéepe them alwaies warme. Of the Fellon or Ancome in the Fingers. §. 12. THis impostumation which some do call Panaricium, and we a Fellon or An∣come, is none other but a sharpe and hote impostumation of the fingers, which bring such a paine with them, that the patient thereby, neither by night nor by day can rest or sléepe, neither can get any ease by any means, vntill that the said impostume be opened. This impostumation is first to be remedied with cooling things that do also thereby mollifie and ripen, like as this salue following: Take the oyle of Masticke, and vnripe Sallad oyle, of each one ounce, cleansed Antimonium halfe a dragme, prepared Tutiae thrée drag. white Waxe halfe an ounce, Rosin halfe an ounce, the Waxe, Rosin, and Oyle are to be molten together, and the rest to be tempered amongst it; afterwards annoint the fingers with it often. Item, take Sulphur, Garlicke, Carui, the soote of a Chimney, and Salt, of each a like quan∣titie: powne all to pap and bind it vpon the hand. Yet one more: Take the innermost skins of Eg-shels, lay them vpon the finger, and this former salue vpon them, wherewith we wil com∣mend, and commit the cure of this accident vnto the Chirurgians. Of the Nailes on the Fingers and Toes. §. 13. THese Nailes are the outward parts of the sinewes, and haue their roote and foun∣dation, and do grow out of the superfluitie of the same, which increasing consi∣steth not at all in the depth or breadth, but onely like to haire in the length. Ari∣stotle saith, that the fingers and the toes are giuen onely for a defence: but Galen addeth vnto it, that they be therefore made, for that therewith all small and sub∣till things might be opened. These Nailes haue of themselues no sense or féeling, therefore do they need no great remedies; and for that cause will we onely admonish here, and discourse of the impostumation of the rootes of the Nailes. And if so be that there be then any impostumation in the rootes of the Nailes, or there hap∣pen any other harme vnto them, then take Sarcocolla, Masticke, and Frankinsence, of each one quarter of an ounce, Comfery, burnt Allume, Hartwoort, of each one dragme, Ammoniacum, Myrrha, Verdigrease, and white Coperas, of each one scruple; powne them all to a subtill powder, and strew vpon it. This powder drieth, consumeth all bad flesh, and it healeth also maruellous well: this may you also vse on the Nailes of the féete. The second Chapter. Of the Legs and the Feete. IN this second part of the outward members we will onely adde & write this, which is, that these Legs like the armes also be diuided into three parts: whereof the vppermost part is the whole hippe euen to the knées: the second part is from the knées euen to the féete: the third part is the féet with all that is annexed vnto them. As much as now con∣cerneth the diseases of these thrée parts, they are to be holpen and healed with the same remedies which be ordained for the armes. But the legs be subiect to other mo especiall accidents, as broken veins called Varices,
wherewith commonly the thighes, the knées, and the calues are burthened, like as we will admonish thereof in the fift Part, the first Chapter, and fift §. amongst other swellings. And al∣beit that it first of all behooueth to discourse of the vppermost part of the legs: yet will we neuer∣thelesse deferre it, vntill that we come where we shall write of the Sciaticke, or Gout of the hips, because that we will obserue our method. Of the Knees §. 1. AS much as concerneth the knees and other members moe, the which haue no seuerall description; therewith is to be dealt, like as is said in the Chapter of the Armes: but that onely for all diseases of the knées, the oyle of Tiles is highly recommended. In like sort also this salue following is very requisite for all disea∣ses of the knées, and of all other members, whether they be bruised through thrusts, through eluxations, or wrinchings: Take the iuice of Sage, of Betonie, of Rosemary, and of Cammomill, of each one ounce: séeth these iuices in eight ounces of good wine, vntil the wine be almost wasted, then put powned Mastick vnto it, and Frankinsence, of each three drag. and let them seeth againe vntill they be méetly thicke: afterwards temper therein one scru∣ple of Saffron, oyle of Roses, of Earthwormes, and of Masticke, of each one ounce and a half, oyle of Iunipers, powned Linséede, and powned Iuniper berries, of each one quarter of an ounce, then temper all them together. And if so be that it be too soft, then put a litle Waxe vn∣to it. When as any bodie hath any cold defluxion fallen into his knées, that he can neither go nor stand, then is this following especiall good, and also many times approued: Take the oyle of Tyles, and of Turpentine, of each one dragme, oyle of Argall halfe a dragme, oyle of Euphor∣bium one scruple, oyle of Dill, and of Iuniper, of each one quarter of an ounce; make a salue thereof with a little Waxe, and annoint the knées warme with it. You shall also find hereafter diuers sundrie remedies for this in the description of the Poda∣gra, and of Arthritis, which may be also vsed vnto the knées. As much as doth appertaine vnto the veines of the knées hath bene written before in the Introduction. Of the Shins. §. 2. IT commeth also oftentimes to passe, that there riseth vpon the Shins certaine vlcers which are not so soone to be healed, but continue long, & do corrode also hitherwards and thitherwards, and make very great scabs; for which this fol∣lowing is to be vsed and thus prepared: Take Waxe and Rosin, of each one ounce, shéepes suet two ounces, Pitch, and Sallad oyle, of each three ounces, Masticke, and Frankinsence, of each thrée dragmes and a halfe, washt Litharge of gold one ounce and a halfe, Ceruse one quarter of an ounce; let the Oyle and the Rosin be sodden together, and then melt the Waxe amongst it. When it beginneth to be cold, then tem∣per all the other things powned small amongst it, and so kéepe it in a pot. At the first wash these vlcers thrice euery day with warme swéet wine, and then annoint it afterwards with the said salue. Item: Take Ceruse, Antimonie, Lytharge of gold, and burnt Lead, all of them washed, of each one ounce, molten suet thrée ounces, Frankinsence, Momie, Sandaraca, Sarcocolla, burnt Allume, and Dragon bloud, of each one ounce and a halfe, oyle of Roses, and of Vineger, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Waxe and Rosin, of each one ounce, make a plaister of it. This said plaister is very good for all depascent vlcers which be caused of a burnt melancholick mat∣ter, it expelleth heate, it drieth, it asswageth the paine, it maturateth all hard biles and pushes, and especially it healeth all vlcers of the Shins.
The piaiscer Sparadrapum is also vsed for this, which is thus to be prepared: Take thrée oun∣ces of Sheepes sewet, oyle of Roses and Ceruse, of each one ounce, Vineger foure ounces, Li∣tharge of gold one ounce and a halfe, Rosin and Turpentine, of each one ounce; let the oyle and the fat seeth well together, afterwards put the vineger and all other things vnto it: and then adde as much molten Waxe vnto it as will suffise for to make a tough plaister of it. This plaister is also very good; but the patient must aboue all things beware of ouermuch going and wearying the legs. Of the Feete. §. 3. THe Féete be as foundations of the whole bodie, which also be in like manner di∣uided into thrée parts, viz. the Insteps of the Féete, the Plants or Soles, and the fiue Toes, which be not vnlike to the fingers, but that they be a litle shorter: and that the great Toe doth shut vp and close the rest of the toes, as the thombe doth the fingers. They be very helpful and commodious vnto men that they may stand the faster, and the better beare the burthen of the bodie. These Féete and the whole legges do otherwhiles get the crampe, or a contracture of the sinewes, whereof we haue written much before in the first Part, the twelfth Chapter, 14. and 15. §. They do oftentimes stinke very much: and to remedie it there is nothing, but oftentimes to change ones sockes, and to bath the Féete in water wherein Nutte leaues, Cypers leaues, Allume, and other well sauouring and odoriferous things be decocted. You haue also before in the second §. of the first Chapter, where is discoursed of the stench of the Armepits, further in∣structions. For this it is also méete to kéepe cleane the place betweene the toes, and to vse often∣times warme Foote bathes, and then to strew burnt Allume betwéene the toes, which dryeth the stinking, and also kéepeth them cleane. And because the Féete be much subiect to be frozen, which yéeldeth no small hinderance to a bodie in going, therefore we will discourse somewhat thereof. Hereupon do some lay playing cards wetted, and affirme that they heale this disease in eue∣ry respect whether it be open or not. Some do counsell that a blew woollen cloute should be burnt to powder and strewed vpon it. Item, take the whites of fiue Egs, and burne them in a litle Barrowes grease, and annoint the frozen place with it; but I take the yolks to be better. This following is best of all: Take Turpentine, and put meetely much Salt vnto it, stirre it so long vntill it be thicke like vnto dough: after that spread it on a cloth, and lay it thereon the space of eight dayes, at the least twice a day: if it be vsed immediatly after that the Féete be fro∣zen; then doth it cleanse the same, and healeth it presently. Cornes on the Toes.Touching Cornes which come vpon the Féete, so it is, that in the middest of the same there groweth a small black or white callositie, like as it were a wart, the which through his hardnes maketh so great a paine, that one can hardly treade or go vpon it. Whereto some of these reme∣dies ensuing may be vsed: Take the gall of a Pickerell, and bind it vpon it, or annoint it there∣with. Item, make a plaister of red sealing Waxe, and lay it thereon. Others do go somewhat tougher to worke with it, and do take yellow Arsenicke, (which is Orpiment) Copperas, and Allume, of each a like quantitie, and temper it vnto a salue with hony, and annoint it there∣with. Or they do take one quarter of an ounce of Galbanum, and let it steepe so long in vineger vntill it be as soft as salue, and lay the same so long vpon it vntill the cornes weare away. But this following is oftentimes found to be good, so that the whole Corne falleth away ther∣by, and is also very safe: Take of the plaister Diachilon magnum, and Pitch, which is Shooma∣kers Waxe, of each a like much, make a plaister of it; spread it on a cloth, and lay it vpon it the space of thrée or foure dayes beneath on the plants of the Féet, and go vpon it; afterwards take fresh againe so long vntill they be throughly whole. You shall find mo other good things in the first Part, where we do discourse of warts, which be also very commodious for this purpose.
The third Chapter. Of the paine in the Ioynts in generall. NExt to the forementioned diseases & sicknesses which the armes hands, legs, and féet be subiect vnto, there be diuers moe and much stronger dis∣eases than the former, in the ioynts which be also very néedfull to be de∣scribed. But we will aboue all discourse generally of them, and diuide this matter into two parts: wherof the first part is called by the learned Gutta, wherein shall be shewed all the causes, signes, orders, and other things which be commonly requisite for all paines of the ioynts. The second part shall we comprehend vnder a generall Gout, or Arthri∣tis, vnder which is contained all paines of the ioynts: for most famous Phisitions do seuerally write of them, and afterwards we will speake of thrée other sundrie Species of the Gout, which onely light vpon certaine places of the bodie, as Chiragra, Ischia, and Podagra. All sorts of Gouts may manifest themselues in whatsoeuer part of the bodie they will, yet are they so like one another, and so allyed together, that many learned men haue written of thē all vnder one, and haue onely excepted Ischia, to be another kind: which error grew on this foote; for that all the sorts of it do after one and the same manner paine all the ioynts of the bo∣die. Neuertheles, we will as much as is possible, and as much as the cause requireth, make a seuerall declaration of each by it selfe. Of the Gout in generall called Gutta. §. 1. LIke as we haue before admonished, so do the learned comprehend all diseases and defluxions which do fall into all the ioynts vnder the name of Gutta, which is a passion or paine of the ioynts which falleth into them and the sinewes of mans bodie by some humors or wind from aboue, or from the next adiacent place: or which is caused through bad disposition of the whole bodie. This grieuous paine may also be caused sometimes through a fracture of a bone, through wrenchings, through great stirrings with a full belly, through fals, blowes, thrusts, through eluxations, and through great outward heate or cold: by which meanes all the ioynts are weakened. For this also helpeth much, all cold and waterish meates if the same be long vsed: as fruite, great fishes, and especially if they be without scales, swines flesh, water fowls, and such like. To be idle, and to liue without any exercise. Also excessiue venery, especially after that one hath eaten & drun∣ken. Obstruction of any accustomed course, as of the Pyles, of any open vlcers, of detention of the termes, and such like, whereby nature was accustomed to cleanse her selfe. Item, it is also found by experience, that some do inherite this disease from their auncestors. In fine, there be two principall causes whereby these kinds of diseases be prouoked, as first of all the shew of these defluxions. Secondly, the increasing of these defluxions from aboue. Thirdly, féeblenesse of the members which receiue this superfluitie. The signes of the Gout are manifest of themselues: to wit, if one féele great paine, and that at sundrie times on the places where these defluxions do fall, otherwhiles with swelling, and sometimes without swelling, and whether this procéed of heate or cold, that may be perceiued by féeling. If it then come through any outward cause, that may be demaunded of the sick per∣sons themselues, or if it come through any repletion of the body, that appeareth by the signes of the veines, grosnesse of the body, fulnes of the pulse, sloth of all the members, by the dimini∣shing of vnderstanding or memorie, losse of appetite, and by the féeblenesse of the sight. If this disease be caused through bloud, then it is commonly in fat & repleated bodies, with paine of the head, with great vnlustines, with vnquiet sléepe, with diminishing of the vnderstanding, with wearines, with rednes of the whole bodie and the vrine: there is also heate with it, pan∣ting and swelling, and that in the place infected, especially if one haue liued sumptuously. Item, all cold things are welcome vnto him, and all warme things painfull, and if they be vsed too
long, also hurtfull: Yet this the rather in young persons being full of bloud by nature, and if he dwell in a hote countrie. If this disease be caused of Phlegma, or of cold humors, then is there neither panting nor great paine with it, but remaineth for the most part in one place without remouing hitherwards or thitherwards; neither is there also any great rednes or heat with it, and for the more certaintie that the same is caused through Phlegma, if the same be so found in an old person in winter time, after that he hath eaten much cold and moist meates and drinks, or hath much and long frequented water. Also all warme things be acceptable vnto him and all cold things noysome. If so be that this disease procéed of Cholera, then is there a strong heate with it, that one can hardly suffer it in the féeling, also a great pain without swelling, with drought & distention. With this will the patient also perceiue a bitternes of the mouth. And these things will be the rather confirmed if the patient be young and cholericke by nature, or if it be sommer time: also being hote and dry weather, &c. This paine of the ioynts proceedeth very seldome, or also neuer through melancholy, if it be not mixed with some subtill moisture, then is there very litle paine with it, and also litle help for it whatsoeuer is done vnto it: for the place of this disease will be hard, remaineth blacke without any rednes. And it hapneth not but in old folkes about winter, &c. If this be caused of wind, then is it swollen, thicke without great paine, which oftentimes remoueth from the one ioynt to the other, and the patient hath vsed much meate and drinke before which do ingen∣der wind. If there be any humors mixed amongst these winds, then must it be considered and passed vpon the forementioned signes, whereby will very soone be perceiued what humor hath mixed it selfe amongst these winds, according to which euery one may know how to dispose and gouerne himselfe. Like as then hitherto in diuers places certaine common rules haue bene made, so will we procéed here also: whereof the first is. For as much as the Goute Arthritis, Podagra, and such like, appeare most of al in haruest, by reason of the fruite eaten the whole sommer, therfore must all fruits be eschued. Secondly, for as much as venery is so hurtfull for this disease, and increa∣seth it very much, the same is to be refrained as much as is possible. Thirdly, a quiet idle life, & sleepe by day time do hinder that the superfluitie cannot be consumed. To the contrary, too great stirring and exercise, whereby the members be ouer heated, are also oftentimes the cause of this paine of the members; therefore is the same as much as is possible to be eschued. Fourthly, all Wine, and especially strong wine is very hurtful for all them that be plagued with the Gout. Fiftly, all rioting and drunkennes make bad digestion, whereby also the paine of the Gout is augmented. Sixtly, they that be hote of nature, and addicted to the Gout, are to refraine from all phlegmaticke meate which is drest with sundry things, and also from all meate which doth make Cholera and bloud, for that when these two humors come together, then do they bring grosse and vndigested defluxions in the ioynts, whereof then the Gout is caused. Seuenthly, there be some through purging & letting of bloud that are fréed from this disease, which may most commodiously be done in the spring of the yere. Eightly, the aire hurteth them much that be troubled with the Gout. Ninthly, all great grosse fishes, and especially Eeles be hurtfull for the Gout. Tenthly, sucking Pigs, all water fowles and old Hens are especially hurtfull to the lower members. Eleuenthly, milk and wine eaten together be very noysome for all members, and very hurtfull for the head. Twelfthly, the drinke which is taken without thirst bringeth much hurt to the body. Thirtéenthly, like as great surfetting with meate is very hurtfull for all the ioynts, euen so doth a moderate diet refresh them. Fourtéenthly, the going too much, or wea∣rie walking, & hanging downe of the legs, especially presently after meate, is very hurtfull for the ioynts. Fiftéenthly, to lie vpon ye back is also hurtful. Sixtéenthly, anger is enemy to this disease. Seuentéenthly, the great sensibility of ye ioints, & especially of the féet, cannot suffer any paine. The foresaid seuentéene rules are only ordained for this purpose, to frée one from the Goute: but as much as doth concerne the meanes whereby these ioynts are to be strengthened and preserued, that the same do not receiue those defluxions whereon dependeth the principall meanes to frée one from it, are in these rules following to be obserued. Eightéenthly, it is very requisite that the féet be often bathed in Allum water. Nintéenthly, Sage decocted in Béere, and the same drunken oftentimes, is commended, as it were a very secret medicine and receipt which hath an ineffable operation in all diseases of the ioynts. Twentithly, Almond
floure, Cammomill, Myrrhe, Melilote and Roses be very commodious for the ioints. Calmus and ground Iuie haue an especiall vertue for to strengthen all the ioints: the same doth also the Indian Nut kernell. One and twentithly, Verueine laid fresh vpon the féet and so worne, is very good for the Podagra. These things following do strengthen much the sinewes. The roote Behen and his oyle doth warme the contracted sinewes: in like manner also Bdellium and Calmus laid vpon it with oyle of Citron péeles, of Cammomill, of Beuercod, Cypers rootes, Cassie wood and Cypers: also oyle of Costus, and such like oyles are maruellously praised & commended for the sinewes, and Cen∣torie in clisters. Item, feet water made of the ashes of a Bay tree. For a salue, the mother of Sal∣lad oyle is good, and the dregs of the oyle of Lillies, and of all other oyles which be warme by nature. Opopanacum is also much commended, but Pyretrum and Pepper aboue all other to warme the sinewes. For this be also drie swéete bathes good, or naturall Sulphur bathes. Af∣ter purging is Treacle and Mithridate much commended in all cold Goutes, drunken with wine wherein Sage hath been decocted. But as much as concerneth the curing of these ioint diseases, it is not needfull to discourse any further of them, bicause that we hereafter will write of this matter at length. Therefore we will proceed in the name of God. The fourth Chapter. Of the Goute in the Ioints, Arthritis. THe second description which speaketh commonly of the paine in the ioints, whereof we haue briefly admonished before, is that which the Latinists do call Morbum articularem, & the Grecians Arthritim, which is as much to say, as the paine of the ioints, or an inflammation of the ioints, which procéedeth from within the bodie, and the Tendones be annoyed, hurt and pained. In fine, it is none other than a dispersed Po∣dagra ouer the whole bodie: the which at one time commeth behinde in the neck, another time in the shoulder blades; then againe in the back bone, and in the hands, in the fingers, and in the elbowes: the which also sometimes créepeth into the nethermost ioints, as in the legs, the knées, in the feet and toes. And although in this disease, like as also in other diseases more, there be many sundrie remedies sought by many sundrie carefull Phisitions, according to the qualitie of the cause, and place of the paine; therfore is there but one generall rule to be obserued. First, how one shal be preserued from this disease. Secondly, how that the same is to be cured and taken away altogither. And bicause the time of the yéere importeth not a little therein, therefore is choise to be made of it. In summer the matter is thus to be handled. This kind of patient in the beginning of sum∣mer is to be purged with that which ensueth: Take Agaricus one dragme, Sugar one ounce, Hermodactils one dragme and a halfe, water of field Cypers thrée ounces, make the water warme, and stéepe the rest fower and twenty howers in it; afterwards wring it hard out, and drinke it warme in the morning, and then fast sixe howers vpon it. Afterwards is this potion following to be vsed at least eight daies togither early in the mor∣ning, and to fast fower houres after it: Take one ounce of the honie of Roses, the water of white water Mints, and the water of field Cypers, of each one ounce and a halfe; temper them togither. He may also take to prepare the humour, honie of Roses, Syrupum de Stoechade, and some of the foresaid waters. The ninth day shall he swallow these pils following: Take Pillu∣larum de Hermodactilis and Foetidarum, of each halfe a dragme; make thereof seuen pils with the sirupe of Roses, and take them early in the morning. And if so be that one would take no pils, then take fiue dragmes of Hieralogodion and Tur∣bith beaten small, halfe a scruple, Diagridion two graines, Ginger three graines; temper them togither, and take it so, or put some distilled water vnto it. Some expert Phisitions do aduise much to this Clister: Take Ireas, the rootes of wilde Cucumbers, field Cipers, & Saint Iohns woort, of each two handfuls, seeth them all togither in sufficient water; then take of this decoction twelue or sixteene ounces, and temper therewith
Hieralogodion one ounce, oyle of Rue thrée ounces, honie of Roses one ounce, the yolke of an Egge well braied, Salt one dragme, vse it once a day. In Haruest is the patient once euery fourtéene dayes to take one dragme of these pils fol∣lowing: Take Aloe two ounces, Agaricus and Hermodactyli, of each one quarter of an ounce, Coloquint one dragme and a halfe, Ginger, Cinnamome, Asarabacca, Cloues and Mace, of each one scrup. Turbith and Epithymus, of each one drag. Saffron one scruple, stamp each alone: afterwards temper them togither, and powre sufficient field Cipers water vpon it, and then set it out to drie in the Sun. Lastly, powre more of the same water vpon it, and let it drye againe, to the end you may fashion Pils of it. Secondly, there is to be considered how that next after purging, betwéene the spring and haruest, the matter might be deriued towards another place, and so to expell it, which may be best of all done by those meanes which force vrine, whereto these things following are to be v∣sed. First the patient is to drinke about the space of fourtéene dayes, euery morning fiue ounces of Asarabacca sugred: or in the stéed thereof the water of Madder which is better. There is also good for this both these things following: Take Pease meale one scruple, old Treacle halfe a dragme; temper them togither with two nces of Smallage water, and so drinke it, and fast fiue howers after it. Item, take Trociscos de Eupatorio halfe a dragme, Gromell séed, Cinna∣mom and Carui, of each fiue graines, Benedicta laxatiua one dragme and a halfe; temper them togither with two ounces of strong white wine, then drinke it and fast fiue howers after it. All that shall be hereafter mentioned consumeth the defluxions which be still setled in the ioynts: then is the place of this disease to be rubbed softly, and annoynted with this following, according as the patient can suffer it: Take vnripe Sallad oyle two ounces, well parched salt one ounce, annoint the ioints very warme with it, and then wrap them in warme clothes. The ioynts are to be also fomented with light red wine and vineger powred on hot stones, that they may sweate well. They are also to be annointed with this following: Take Sagapenum one ounce, Bdellium and Ammoniacum, of each halfe an ounce, Sandaraca one quarter of an ounce: the Gum is to be dissolued in a little red Vineger, and with Waxe make a salue thereof. Another: Take oyle of Roses and of Cammomill, of each one ounce, thrée yolks of egges, Saffron grains; temper them & vse them togither. After the annoynting you are to strew the powder of earthwormes vpon it, and couer it close with shéepes wooll. Or take oyle of Foxes, oyle of earthwormes, and washt Turpentine, of each one quarter of an ounce, Salt thrée dragms: vse thē as before. You are also to annoynt the same places with warme oile of Roses. This following is also very highly commended: Take Venice Sope three ounces and a halfe, cut it verie thin, and then let it seeth a waume or twaine in sixe ounces of the water of Fumitory: afterwards you are to put vnto it the oyle of Euphorbium, and of S. Iohns woort, of each halfe an ounce, oyle of Iuniper one ounce and a halfe, oyle of Earthwormes, one ounce; let it then seeth vntill that the water be sodden away: afterwards you are to put vnto it Ma∣stick and Frankinsence, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sulfure vif, Euphorbium, and Pieretrum, of each two drag. and a halfe: vse it as is aforesaid. Oile of earth wormes.The oyle of Earthwormes is especiall good for all paine of the ioints, and for all frozen sinewes; the which is made thus: Take Earthwormes thrée ounces; wash the same with Wine, and powre vnto it twelue ounces of Sallad oyle, Wine sixe ounces: seeth them togi∣ther by a gentle fire vntill the Wine be sodden awaie, afterwards strayne them thorough a cloth. For this disease be all warme baths also requisite. And if they cannot be gotten, then are the same to be made by the aduice of a learned Phisition, yet the most commodious time of ba∣thing is from the middest of April to the end of May. And because that these defluxions be more manifest in the Spring and Haruest, than in any other time of the yéere, vnto which times we haue appropriated all these foresayd remedies: therfore will we now teach what is to be done vnto it in winter. For this is purging to be vsed againe, and that in this maner following. When as September is halfe past, then are these pils to be taken once in the morning: Take Pillulas de Agarico, & de Hermodactylis, of each halfe a dragme, Indy salt two graines, make seuen Pils thereof with the Confection of Roses. The day after is this following to be dronken, the which is thus 8. or 10. daies togither to be cōtinu∣ed: Take the sirupe of Wormwood, and Syrupum de Eupatorio, of each thrée quarters of an ounce,
water of Hops, or field Cipers, of each one ounce and a halfe, temper them together: after∣wards is this following to be drunken: Take the Confection Benedicta three dragmes, Inda two dragmes and a halfe, water of blew flower deluce two ounces; temper them al together, make it warme and drinke it. Afterwards are the foresaid pils which be ordained to be vsed in Haruest, beginning: Take Aloe, &c. to be vsed throughout all the Winter. As much as concerneth other things, those remedies are to be vsed which be ordained to be vsed in Summer, onely that they must be vsed in more quantitie; like as it is aduised in Sum∣mer to take one dragme, in Winter one dragme and a halfe: & so also with bathing & otherwise. You shall hereafter haue many sundrie things which may be vsed against the Gout, or ioint diseases, viz. Confected Quinces, Marmalade, and all that may be made of Quinces, except that there be no spices with it if the disease be with heate. For this, be things also good which shal shortly after be ordained for the Gout Podagra. If so be that there be no speciall heate with it, and that wine may be vsed without any great danger, then is it his nature that it strengthe∣neth all outward members, if the same be moderatly drunken. Amongst herbe wines are these following much commended for it, viz. of Rosemarie, of Wormwood, of Sage, and of Clarie: all which not onely drunken, but also the ioynts annointed with it; or the vapor thereof recei∣ued into the diseased ioynts, do also strengthen the same. When one is come to his former health, then must one looke to it and also beware and take héed frō all those things which are wont to cause those kinds of defluxions into the said ioynts: To which end you may looke all the rules in the first Chapter, which be described in the first §. Take good Turpentine the quantitie of a Beane, or in stead of that Opopanacum, or Sagapenum, which you will in the like quantitie. There is very méete in like manner, if one take early in the morning halfe a scrup. of Lignum Aloes, with an ounce of the water of field Cipers. It is also much aduised to take twice euery wéeke one dragme of good Mithridate, or in steade thereof one Mirobalan Chebuli chewed and eaten: or one day Mithridate, and the other day one Mirobalan. All these foresaid things be not onely commodious, but also very safe. Let this suffice now generally spoken of the ioynt disease Arthritide, and we will now proceede with the Chiragra. The fifth Chapter. Of the Gout in the hands, Chiragra. FOr the second sort of the Gout will we describe the Chiragra, the which we do properly call the hand Gout. But because that betwixt the Gout of the hands and that of the féete there is none other difference, but that the one com∣meth in the hands and the other in the feete: therefore will we here referre vs to the Gout of the féete, where we will thoroughly discourse of these two kinds of infirmities. The sixt Chapter. Of the Gout of the Hips Ischia, commonly called Sciatica. BEfore in the first Chapter and first §. in deuiding the sorts of the Gout, and in the description of Gutta, is this kind Ischia taken for the third sort, the which of the Phisitions that do not well vnderstand the Gréeke spéech, is called Scia and Sciatica. This Gout of the hips is a long lin∣gring paine, and especially when it commeth into the bones of the hips: notwithstanding that it doth otherwhiles appeare in the vppermost parts, which is caused of a cold moisture that falleth downe from aboue: And because that her grosse toughnes cānot easily be cōsumed, but much rather augmented from day to day and made worse, then falleth it at the last into the knées, the legges, into the féete, and so out at the toes. The same tough humors do
cause also oftentimes through their great, grosse and tough sliminesse, that the hip bones be e∣luxated, although otherwhiles they returne againe to their naturall places, and that when the ligaments of these ioynts through this waterish moisture happen to be loosed or resolued, and afterwards waxe hard againe, and shrinke vp as before. But if this foresaid hip bone be long eluxated, then doth it come easily to passe, that thereby the whole leg commeth to extenuate; whereof then a meere impotencie or lamenesse might follow: so that this disease afterwards very hardly, but by actuall cauterization may be holpen, whereby the matter may be drawne out with cautery, which, when one is minded to vse it, is to be done beneath the knées in the Calues, and that in the leg so diseased. But before and ere we come to the remedie we will first prescribe a generall rule how to go∣uerne himselfe in his order of diet, which not only in this, but also in other sicknesses (according to the importance of the cause and place) may be diminished, augmented and altered. This that followeth here is ordained for them, in whose bodies all grosse, cold, tough and flegmaticke humors tempered with Cholera, do abound. But these must first eschew all cold ayre, low dwellings, and especially they which do lie neare the water side. The windowes of his dwellings are also to open against the South and East (if it be faire weather) and the rest remaine shut. And if so be that the time of the yeare wil permit it, then is his chamber to be alwaies kept warme, with a continuall fire, and to be hang the stone wals with Tapestrie, or to let it be wainescoted, or fenced with boords. In like maner he is also to kéepe his head well from cold, and to beware of great exercise, especially if he féele any paine, and that so long as any paine is instant, and vntill the ioynts be strengthened. What concerneth further the meate and drinke, one is to kéepe himselfe therein moderatly, and to vse all such sorts of meates and drinks which do yéeld small sustenance or nourishment, and be méete rather to make one leane than fat, and especially if there be any debility of the sto∣macke, or any wambling with it. He is also to chew his meate well, and to eschew the varie∣tie of drinkes: Otherwise he is to vse those meates which be warme and drie, and that are drest and strewed with any drying and warming things; as with Pepper, Salt, Cinnamom, Nut∣megs, Fennell, Parsley, Annis, Hyssope, Mints, Thyme, and such like things moe. His bread must be a little more than common bread, leauened and salted. He is also to eate no other flesh but Hens, Pullets, Pigeons, Fesants, and all kind of field Fowls: yet for the most part rather rosted than sodden. Veale and Mutton is also very healthie for him. Amongst herbes be Cole∣woorts, Fennell, yellow rapes, &c. very good for him: but all cold herbes must he eschew, or at least vse them very seldome & litle, and being alwaies tempered with some warme herbes: red Pease, Lentils, and Rice drest with fresh flesh, may he eate. Amongst fruits there be none that be more requisite than Figs, Raisins, Hasell nuts, Almonds & such like. The swéet odoriferous Grapes be not much forbidden him. He is also to be restrained from butter as much as is possi∣ble, because of her slime and moist nature: but rather in stead thereof to vse the oyle of swéet Almonds, Sallad oyle, or oyle of Walnuts. Vineger, Veriuice, Limons, Oranges, or their iuice be not much commended, and if one will euer vse them, then must some other warming things, as Salt, Pepper, Cinnamom, be tempered with it in eating of other meats. All fish & doughie meates be very hurtfull vnto him. The best drinke that he can drinke is Hony water, which may be prepared as followeth: Take twelue quarts of water, and one quart of Hony, let them séeth together vntill eight quarts remaine: if you put Annis vnto it, then will it be the better. Certaine later Phisitions do aduise (and that with good reason) that these patients should drinke the decoction of Guaiacum: and how the same is to be prepared, that shall you find descri∣bed hereafter in the fift part, in the discourse of the Pocks. Out of these forementioned reasons is it easily to be noted and marked, that it were very good vtterly to forbeare wine: but if it can∣not be, then to chuse a thin red wine, or the sirupe of Betonie, and Oxymel of Squils decocted with Annis water. Further, it is not very good to sléepe much, and chiefly in the day time immediatly after meate, for that ingendreth much slime and other tough moistures. One hower and a halfe af∣ter supper is he to go to bed, & to lie first vpon the right side, afterwards vpon the left. Through much lying vpon the backe do the defluxions fall to great preiudice behind in the necke, and in the backe bone. His sléepe shall also not indure longer than seuen or eight howers, and the rest of the time is to be spent in watching.
Of the paine in the Hippes or Sciatica through heate. §. 1. TO remedie the manner of this paine, is but a little different from all other ioint diseases, because that they alwaies for the most part procéed of cold, and do lie déepe in the ioynts of the Hippes. For the which in this disease all diureticall medicines be hurtfull, because that therby the matter will be made so much the grosser and tougher; so that afterwards it can by no meanes be consumed. Now when this disease is caused through heate, wherein commonly a cold flegma∣ticke matter is mixed with Cholera: yet notwithstanding, Phlegma getting the maisterie, the same may easily be perceiued by the high coloured vrine, and other signes moe. Therefore for a beginning is the liuer veine to be opened in the arme, and that in the same side where the pain is: afterwards the veine (which is named of the disease Scia) and standeth as is described in the Introduction, vpon the foote, and to let out foure or fiue ounces of bloud. But good héed is to be taken therein vnto the strength and power of the patient: for that, like as we haue said in other places, the veines in the lower parts do weaken the bodie more when they be opened, than those in the vppermost parts. Other do counsell, that first the veine in the foote is to be opened: and if so be that the paine do not cease in some dayes after it, that then the same veine should also be once opened in the other foote: and beware of going the space of eight dayes. Likewise is also much commended to set boxing cups vpon the Hips, or aboue the Hips, according to the importance of the disease. Of the paine in the Hips or Sciatica through cold. §. 2. BVt if so be that this paine of the Hips procéed through cold, like as for the most part it is wont to do, the which the bleaknesse of the face, the lingring paine, the belching of the stomacke, the wambling and the falling downe of all cold humors doth shew: then is the patient to be respected and taught to order himselfe accordingly: yet haue you for an example this ensuing. For a preparatiue of the matter, make this sirupe following, and then take thereof about two ounces at once, according to that one is bound or loose of the bodie: and so fast foure houres after it. Take Fennell rootes, Sperage rootes, Parsly rootes, Smallage rootes, and Polipodie roots, of each one ounce, the séede of Ruscus, wild Sage, Gromill seedes, Nettle seed, the roots of Sar∣ifrage, and the séedes of stone Parsley, of each one ounce, Harts tongue two ounces, Iuniper berries thrée drag. Hermodactyli, and Turbith, of each halfe an ounce, Hony 18. ounces, Radish water 24. ounces, make a sirupe thereof. Item, take all the foresaid things, and put vnto it Ginger, wild Saffron séede, of each one ounce and a halfe, Agaricus thrée dragmes, stone Salt two scruples, Mace two scruples and a halfe, Sirupus de Stechade thrée ounces, Honie as much as before, Rosemarie water, of Calmus and of Sage as much as will suffise; afterwards séeth a sirupe thereof. At the last put a little Cinnamom, Masticke, Cloues, Nutmegs, and Mace vnto it: also a little Muske and Amber. For to purge: Take the Confection of Inda thrée dragmes, or halfe an ounce, de Succo Rosa∣rum one dragme and a halfe, water wherin Ginger is decocted thrée ounces: giue this betimes in the morning, and then sléepe one hower after it: afterwards take a draught of Barly water after it. But if you had rather take Pils, then take Pillulas foetidas, and Hermodactylorum, of each apart one dragme, or mixed, of each halfe a dragme. This also ensuing is to be prepared: Take the water of Pionie rootes, and the rootes of Nar∣cissus, of each two ounces, drinke this for the space of certaine daies, early in the morning. Thereupon you are thrée howers after it, to swallow these pils following: take Pillulas foe∣tidas, and de Sarcocolla of each halfe a dragme, Swines bread one dragme: make thereof twelue pils with the iuice of Smallage.
Other do take washt Aloe halfe an ounce, Agaricus one drag. make thereof with the sirupe de Acetoso composito, 35. Pils: then take of it about the third or fourth euening iust before sup∣per, according to the qualitie of the cause. Sharpe Clisters with Salt, with Hiera, with Coloquint and other appropriate things, be excéeding requisite for this, as also are these ensuing: Take vnwormeaten Hermodactyls one ounce, field Cipers, Stechados, Saint Iohns woort, Carui, and Rue séede, of each one handfull and a halfe, Cammomill, Melilot, and Dill séede, of each one handfull, Saffron flowers one dragme: seeth them all together in sufficient water, and take twelue or sixtéene ounces of this decoction, Beuercod oyle thrée ounces, Indie salt one quarter of an ounce, Hiera Colocynthidis halfe an ounce, temper them, and set it meetly warme. These Clisters are very méete for to draw the cold matter from the hips, and to expell wind. Another: Take Coloquint halfe an ounce, Turbith, wild Saffron séede, and Polypodie rootes, of each halfe an ounce, Asarabacca, field Cipers, Stechados, Pionie, white Pepper, and Rue séede, of each one dragme and a halfe: seeth them all together, and take of this decoction as before, and put vnto it oyle of Costus, and of Beuercod, of each one ounce and a halfe, Saltpe∣ter foure scruples: but vse it not too hote. The third. Take the pickle of Herings, or salted Limons twelue ounces, oyle of Beuer∣cod thrée ounces, minister this Clister like as the rest. These Clisters be much commended of all later and auncient Phisitions: but they bruise otherwhiles the Arseguts within, which are hardly to be healed afterwards. The fourth which is not too strong. Take S. Iohns woort, Cammomill, Centorie, Dill, Ma∣lowes, Brionie rootes, and Fenegreeke, of each one ounce, Annis three dragmes, Coloquint one quarter of an ounce, stone Salt halfe a drag. Bran half a handfull, oyle of bitter Almonds, and clarified Hony, of each one ounce, mixe them all together. For a fomentation you are to take Pionie séede, Pionie rootes, and Hermodactyli, of each one ounce and a halfe, S. Iohns woort, Artichoke leaues, Stechados, and the herbe Calmus, of each foure ounces, and eight or ten heads of white Poppie; séeth them all together in thrée pints of water euen to the halfe, at last put vnto it one ounce and a halfe of Saffron-flowers, and after∣wards make a great cloth or a sponge wet in this decoction, and foment therewith twice a day the hip and all the buttocke three or foure times together. Immediatly after fomenting is the Hippe to be annointed all ouer with this following: Take vnripe Sallad oyle, or oyle of Roses foure ounces, oyle of Costus and of Southerne∣wood, of each one ounce and a halfe, Sandaraca one quarter of an ounce, Frankinsence, Hypo∣cistis, Pionie seede, and Hermodactyli, of each one quarter of an ounce, Saltpeter, and Saf∣fron of each one dragme, Serapium, Opopanacum, and Rosin, of each one dragme and a halfe, red Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make a salue: temper them all together by the fire. This salue expelleth the paine. The same is also well to be vsed without fomenting: to wit, at noone. Another: Take oyle of Foxes thrée ounces, oyle of Pieretrum, of Beuercod, Badgers grease, of each halfe an ounce, Artichoke rootes, Agaricus and Stechados, of each one dragme, Lettice séede, Purslaine seede, and the seedes of small Endiue, and of water Lillies, of each one quarter of an ounce, Saffron one scruple, white Waxe as much as suffiseth for to make a weake salue with it, afterwards seeth it in foure ounces of the iuice of Salomons seale vntill the iuice be well wasted: then annoint the whole Buttocks with it onely at night: for it is somewhat cold of nature: according to which one may know how he should gouerne him∣selfe. Item, take Turpentine, and small powned Hermodactyli, of each a like quantitie; make a salue of it, and vse it as the rest. But if you had not this salue, or desired not to vse it, then may you annoint the place of the paine with the oyle of Lillies, of Spica, of Costus, of Foxes, and Bayes, and such like warme oyles, whether it be each apart, or tempered together. Of plaisters, these following be good. Take Apostolicon one ounce and a halfe, de Muscilagi∣nibus halfe an ounce, Opopanacum and Galbanum, of each one quarter of an ounce, Pionie rootes, Hermodactyli, Calmus, and white Henbane séede, of each two scrup. Saffron halfe a drag. then make a plaister therof with wax, & spread it vpon two round péeces of leather a span in bredth, & as now lay one vpon it, & then another, & weare them alwaies vpon it, vntil one wil vse the fo∣mentation
at nights. Item, take Ammoniacum sixe ounces, Sagapenum, Bdellium, and Opopana∣cum, of each one dragme and a halfe, Swines bread, and Hermodactyli, of each one ounce and a halfe, Coperas one dragme and a halfe, Waxe as much as is néedfull; make a plaister or salue of it. When this sicknes beginneth to decrease, and yet neuertheles there doth remaine some wea∣risomnesse or anguish in the ioynts, then is this plaister following to be made, and to be laid behin vpon the rumpe, and the whole buttocks: and if the same do make an itch, then is the same to be taken off againe, and the place to be rubbed with rough clothes, and then to lay the same plaister againe vpon it, vntill that the ioynt be well strengthened. Take Pitch sixe ounces, blacke Sope one ounce and a halfe, Hermodactyli and Pyonie seede, of each one dragm, Rosin one ounce, Roses, Masticke, and the iuice of Sloes, of each foure scruples, Euphorbium one scruple, burnt Coperas one dragme, Waxe as much as will suffise for a plaister. In fine, all warming plaisters are very méete for this. The nature of Turpentine is, that it helpeth this Sciatica, through a secret operation: But because the same cannot be layed vpon it, or an∣nointed, therefore is it to be tempered amongst the foresaid oyles first mentioned, or any of them that one will; as the oyle of Saint Iohns woort, which is especially commended for it. Some lay a shéepes skin vpon it, like as it cometh out of warme lye wherein the leather Dres∣sers haue it lying. Item, séeth Comin in water, and make a sponge or twaine moist in this warme decoction: wring it out, and foment the Hippe therewith. Or take Betonie, Sage, both or one of both, séeth them in Wine or Must, and whilst it is yet hote, temper this powder fol∣lowing in it: as Chamedryos, Betony, Centorie, Hartswoort, Gentian, of each halfe an ounce: vse them with a sponge as is beforesaid. Another. Take Elecampane rootes as much as you please, séeth them well in wine, stampe them in Swines grease, and lay it vpon the place. This is also good for all Byles of the Pockes. This following is highly commended: Take Elecampane rootes powned small 8. ounces, of the best Sallad oyle that may be gotten 24. ounces, Malmsey one quart: seeth them all toge∣ther vntill me be consumed, and vse it as before. Take a hote loafe and lay vpon it, or let the warme réeke or vapor go vpon it vntil the place of the paine begin to sweat, and do this certaine times together. After all this foresaid fomen∣ting; annointing, plaistering, and applications, it is firmely aduised againe to vse these pils not for the purging, but onely to strengthen the parts diseased. Take well boyled Turpentine halfe an ounce, field Cipers one quarter of an ounce, Hermodactyli one dragme: make of a drag. sixe or seuen pilles, and take one euery morning and euening. Or take these following which be almost of the same nature: Take Chamedryos, field Cipers, Hermodactyli, of each one dragm, boyled Turpentine halfe an ounce, make pils thereof with the sirupe of Betonie, and vse them as is beforesaid. Further, it is also néedfull that those parts which cause these defluxions be strengthened, the which may be done as followeth. For strengthening of the stomacke he is oftentimes to vse Mace, Cloues, Mints, Indy Spica, Squinant, Cipers rootes, and Lignum Aloes, with his meate, and to vse the Confection Aromaticum Rosarum, and Diacalaminthum, Betony, Balme, and such like, with his accustomed meate. The compounded things are the Confection Diam∣bra, Diamoschu dulcis, and de Xiloaloe, and that especially after supper. The kidneys will be strengthened with Almonds, Hasell nuts, Pingles, dry and salt Chéese, and with meate which is drest with shéepes milke: but they are to beware of much lying on the backe, and much vene∣rie, especially presently after meate. Item, of diureticall things, as Parsley séede, Annis and Smallage séedes, &c. These be now the thrée principall parts and causes of the defluxions. The other parts are not so highly to be regarded. And for to consume these kinds of defluxions be all Phisitions of an opinion, that there is no better aduice than to bath in naturall warme Sulphure bathes, Coperas bathes, Lime bathes, or Ashe bathes. For that these do pierce through the whole bodie, drie excée∣dingly, and do consume also all moysture. And if so be that one cannot get into such naturall bathes, then are Lies or bathes to be prepared of the foresaid things, but the body must first be well purged. And if the patient cannot bathe, or will not bathe, then are these things fol∣lowing to be vsed, which vehemently consume all moisture: Take Sandaraca, Hypocistis,
Frankinsence, and the iuice of Sloes, of each one quarter of an ounce, Lye as much as wil suf∣fise for to dissolue these things, and to temper them withall in a mortar, then annoint the ioint therewith twice a day. This following is milder: Take powned Cipers nuts thrée ounces, Meale dust one ounce, temper them together with the iuice of Bayleaues, as aforesaid. Item, take steeled water sixe ounces, powned Roses two ounces, Masticke, and prepared Iron drosse, of each one ounce, parched Salt thrée dragms, temper them together in a mortar with the iuice of Teasell leaues, or with water wherein the same herbe is decocted, it is good and approued. But if the paine continue, then is there no other remedie (as is beforesaid) but to vse cauterization, which is also effected with plaisters which raise blisters: but before this is to be begunne, the same is first to be tried with the foresaid strong clisters, and afterwards this salue following to be vsed: Take white Mustard séede, and Pigeon dung, of each a like quan∣titie: then séeth figs in a little water vntill they be almost drie, then powne them together for a plaister which is afterwards to be opened, and the water to be let out. If so be that this helpe not at one time, then is it once againe to be vsed: and if the paine cease not then, and the ioynt be eluxated, then is it to be cauterized which is burned, that will be done of an expert Chirur∣gian or learned Phisition. For a conclusion, may powder be vsed, which shall be ordained for the gout in the feete, which beginneth thus: Take two kinds of Chamedryos, &c. And if one which is cured fall againe into the same passion, like as it is wont to happen, and especially in those who haue taken small aduise and but little purged, then is this order to be followed. In the beginning of the paine, take Cipers nuts thrée ounces, Barley meale one ounce and a halfe, Roses one ounce, Mastick, Myrtle séede, and Sarcocolla, of each two drag. and a halfe; séeth this all together in hard white Wine vntill it be méetly tough like a plaister, then lay it warme vpon it. This ensuing is yet more forcible: Take Sandaraca one ounce, Cammo∣mill, Melilot, and Dill séede, of each halfe an ounce, Meale dust thrée ounces, Roses one ounce: séeth them all together in wine, as in the last is beforesaid, then stirre amongst it the yolkes of thrée Egs, and vse it as before. But when the paine is increasing, then put vnto one of these foresaid one ounce of the fat of shéepes wooll: but when the paine is at the extreamest, then are things to be vsed which do as∣swage the paine as followeth: Take oyle of Roses, and of Cammomill, of each thrée ounces, sixe yolkes of Egs, let them séeth very soft, stirring them alwaies about. Last of all, put one dragme and a halfe of Saffron vnto it, and vse it as beforesaid. Or take Cow milke twelue ounces, Barley meale thrée ounces, Masticke halfe an ounce, Saffron one dragme. You are to let the meale and the milke seeth thicke, afterwards temper the rest amongst it. This is especial good if there be any heate with it. But if the paine begin to diminish, then are drying things to be vsed for it: Take Myrtle séede, Masticke, Sarcocolla, Plantaine, Pionie séede, Hermodactyli, and field Cipers, of each one quarter of an ounce: stampe it all to powder, and temper it with one of the forementioned which you will, and you shall find a luckie operation. The seuenth Chapter. Of some accidents which this paine of the Hips doth cause. WE haue in the beginning of this Sciatica declared, that ye legs happen otherwhiles to extenuate, and especially when the member is eluxated or out of ioynt, and hath so continued a long time, whereof there followeth further a numbnesse and lamenesse: for which by good reason we ought to admonish somewhat thereof be∣fore we begin to discourse of the féete. Of the eluxation of the ioynts. §. 1. THis eluxation of the ioynts do the Grecians call Exarthrema. The Latinists Eluxa∣tionem, and it is thus described: Exarthrema is a writhing aside of a ioynt out of his naturall place into another, whereby the frée motion is hindered. This disease can∣not be cured but by manuall operation, and by the knowledge of all the parts of
mans bodie, whereby each member which is eluxated by thrusting, fals, or by loosenesse of the ligaments in the Sciatica, and strengthenings of the diseased member: and although it chiefly concerne the Chirurgians, neuerthelesse we will here discourse somewhat of the eluxation of the hips in the Sciatica. This plaister following doth maruellous much withstand all defluxions which fall downe into any ioynt, and do weaken the same. But first of all are the places of this disease to be rub∣bed with this water following, which is to be distilled out of a Calues gather in séething water or Balneum, the which is so much the better, if so be that there be Sage, Brionie, Iuniper ber∣ries, and such like (according to the qualitie of the cause) added vnto it. Afterwards boiled Tan∣sie laid warme vpon it is very requisite, the plaister whereof we haue spoken before, is thus prepared: Take Colophonia and Pitch, of each one ounce, the Muscilage of Hollihockes thrée quarters of an ounce, Galbanum, Myrrha, Ammonaicum, and Frankinsence, of each three drag. Polypodie rootes, Miscleden and Hartwoort, of each one quarter of an ounce, Waxe one ounce, Turpentine thrée quarters of an ounce, the gums are to be dissolued in vineger, and then to put the Waxe, Pitch, and Turpentine vnto it, and then let it melt by a soft fire, and to séeth so long vntill that all the muscilage and vineger be wasted away, afterwards temper the rest being beaten small amongst it, this being now all done, then spread this plaister vpon a cloth or lea∣ther, and lay it vpon the place of the disease. Another: Take Hollihocke rootes thrée ounces, small Akorne buddes thrée quarters of an ounce, fresh Self-heale flowers one ounce and a halfe, cut all very small, and stampe it to pap: then take vnripe Sallad oyle, and oyle of Myrtles, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, thick red wine 24. ounces, Self heale water twelue ounces: seeth all together so long vntill the wine and the water be consumed. Then wring it out with a presse, and put Frankinsence and Myrrhe vnto it of each one drag. Bucks sewet one scruple and a halfe, Turpentine halfe an ounce; then let them séeth againe vntill all the moisture be consumed. Lastly, put vnto it small brused siluer skumme which is sifted through linnen, and Sealed earth of each halfe a dragme, Mini two dragmes and a halfe, Waxe as much as will suffise for a plaister, this plaister is not onely good for all Eluxations, but also for all fractures of bones, for it swageth all paine, and strengtheneth the sinewes. Item, take a young oaken pole, and shaue off the outwardmost rinds, afterwards the white: these white rinds are to be sodden in Beere, and then a woollen cloth made wet therein, and so laid warme vpon it. If you haue no beere, then take wine or water. Of the extenuated or withered Limmes. §. 2. WE haue before declared in the description of the pain of the hips or Sciatica, that after eluxation of the ioynts, if the same continue long, the legs come quickly to extenuate, and afterwards to be lame. Now for to remedie these accidents will we here discouer certaine things, which, it cannot otherwise well be but that both these diseases, extenuation and leanenesse must depend one vpon the other: for that because the veines be bereft of their due nourishment, the sinewes and the tendons be stiffened, then must necessarily ensue thereof such infirmities. Therefore will we discourse of each apart as much as néed requireth: and concerneth the lamenesse. It is a disease if there be any contracture of the hands, armes, legges, ioynts, or any other part, or be so lamed and numbed, that he cannot vse his ioynts, the which may also grow of many kind of causes, of Apoplexia, of the Pocks, of the Cramp, & such like, of all which hath bene spoken before, and shall be written of hereafter: but we will only discourse how that these diseases are to be preuented, procéeding of other causes. Take Mallowes, Cammomil, Sage, Horehound, and Verueine, of each one handfull, Iuni∣per branches with the gréene berries two handfuls, powre fiue or sixe quarts of water vnto it, and séeth them so long as Calues flesh: this may be vsed the space of thrée dayes, afterwards may a fresh be made. First, take Foxe grease two ounces, Capons grease one ounce, melt them together, stirring them alwaies about. When it is now molten, then put halfe an ounce of Balsam oyle vnto it
and let it be cold. When as both these things be readie, then be the lamed limmes to be fomented in some vessell fit for that purpose. If so be that the lamed part cannot lye whole ther∣in, then is he to be caused to sweate aboue the warme vapor, being couered all ouer, powring the hot decoction now & then vnto it. This bathing or fomenting is to be done euery day two times, & although the first, second, or third fomenting do not sufficiently ease, yet is the same not to be neglected, for that the alteration and ease commeth not before the fourth or fifth day. When as one hath sufficiently bathed, then is the sweate to be stroken off with the flat of the hand, and to let the part drie of it selfe. When as then this fomenting is thus effected, and whilst that the place is still warme and drie, take of the foresaid salue of the bignes of a Pease, and rub it behind in the neck vpon the backbone from one shoulder to the other; but warme the hands oftentimes, and so rub the salue well into it. Thirdly, rub also both the elbowes from the hands, and likewise also both the knées cleane ouer beneath and aboue, at last also the toes be∣neath and aboue with as much alwaies of the foresaid salue as the quantitie of a pease, rubbing it therein. When as this is now so done, then is the patient to rest the space of halfe an hower after it. He may also once in ten or fourtéene daies go into a sweat bath, but not to tarrie aboue one howre in it, and he is the same day to omit the fomentation: but like as is said, one is to procéede with the annoynting and resting. This order is also to be pursued foure, fiue, or sixe wéekes, vntill he can go againe or vse the rest of his ioynts, by this meanes haue many men found great ease. Here do follow many moe other bathes and salues, to wit, that men are to bath the space of ten dayes in decocted Ebulus leaues, and that so long as nature may abide it. Afterwards vse this salue following: Take the grease of the iuice of Alpes Goats sewet, and Badgers grease, of each a like quantitie, make a salue of it with Waxe, and therewith annoint the nummed limmes morning and euening. Or take Sage, Marioram, Saint Iohns woort, Hollihocke leaues and the roote, of each two handfuls, Elecampane rootes one handfull, séeth them all to∣gether, as is said. For to make a precious salue you must haue readie a good fat Goose, and rost the same as if one will eate it, then take good héede that there come no water vnto it, with the necke and the intrailes do therewith what you please. You must haue also readie with it a young, sound, and fat Cat which is thrée moneths old, being a male Cat, kill him and flea him (the head and in∣trailes being cast away) chop it small, stamp it afterwards in a mortar, and adde vnto it thrée ounces of Barrowes lard, cut it very small, Rosin, Frankinsence, & Waxe, of each one ounce and a halfe, stop these all together into the Goose, and stop it tight that it fall not out again, and then let it rost by a mild fire: set a dripping pan vnderneath it for to receiue the fat that droppeth off: reserue this fat being cold, and annoint therewith euery day (in a warme place) the lame and withered members: in like manner also the swollen, and all that haue any paine: the exte∣nuated and withered ioynt will increase and grow againe, and al paine shall be asswaged ther∣by. The Goose is to be well kept, to the end neither man nor beasts happen to eate it. Another salue: Take the marrow of a hail gelding which died through any mischance or in the warres, as much as you please, Harts sewet halfe so much, melt them together by a mild fire and then powre Aqua vitae vpon it, wring it out afterwards very warme thorough a cloth, and then an∣noint therewith the diseased place morning and euening, both these be maruellous good, and also very méete. Item, take the grease of a Beuer, of a Vultur, and of a Badger, of each half an ounce, Sage, Penniroyall, and Hollihocke rootes with the leaues, of each one handfull: seeth well the herbs, and stampe them to grout, then temper the molten grease amongst it, and annoint the lame place with it. Take oyle of Tyles and oyle of Almonds, each alone, or tempered together, and annoint therewith the members. The Mithridate and both the Treacles do bring the lamed members to right againe, and to their former force, being as wel applyed outwardly as taken inwardly: but especially these oyles following be good for it, viz. oyle of Iuniper, of Nutmegs, of Pepper, and blew Floure deluce. Item, take a young Foxe, make him cleane, and chop his flesh very small, afterwards distill out the water, and put therein one dragme of small brused Cam∣fer: then put it into a glasse stopt well, and so leaue it fiue daies in ye earth where as Ants haue their abode. Last of all, annoint you therewith in a warme bath, afterwards vse this salue
following: Take a yong Foxe made very cleane and burnt to ashes, take therof the halfe, and temper therewith one quarter of an ounce of bruised Camfere, oyle of Balsam halfe an ounce, Dogs grease two ounces and a halfe, Snakes grease one dragme and a halfe: melt these salues all together, and annoint you therewith after bathing. Both of these foresaid salues are to be v∣sed against lamenesse through heate and cold, for that they be of a temperate nature, and of the same nature is this also ensuing. Take Rice as much as you will, steepe it a day and a night in a sufficient quantitie of Goats milke, afterwards distill it like as all other waters. This being done, distill it ouer againe, and make oftentimes the lame members moist in it. Of the extenuated or withered members especially. §. 3. FOr as much then as we be entred into this matter, therefore will we not dis∣course of the same seuerally. Albeit this extenuation of the members may rather be named of their occasions then of the Sciatica alone, notwithstanding we wil not here discourse of the consumption Hectica, Apoplexia, or of the Pockes, but onely of the extenuation of some parts, whether it be of the Sciatica, or of any o∣ther cause whatsoeuer, for which these salues following be good: Take wild Cats grease, Harts sewet, Beares grease, Swines grease, the marrow of Neates feete, Hony, Dogs grease, and Badgers grease, of each a like quantitie; séethe all together with wine vntil the same be throughly wasted, afterwards powre it thorough a cloth and annoint the withe∣red limmes with it. Item, take Beuercod one ounce, long Pepper one quarter of an ounce, oyle of Waxe, of Cammomill, and of Beuercod, of each halfe an ounce, Waxe one ounce, make a salue thereof: Or take Sage, Mallowes, Nettles with the rootes, Cammomill, and sprigs of Iuniper, of each one handfull, fresh Butter, and Dogs grease, of each three ounces: chop the herbes and séeth them to grout that one may wring them thorough a course cloth, then put the greases vnto it, and let it séeth againe together vnto a salue. When as now you will vse the same, then are you first to go vnto a sweat bath, and afterwards your selfe to be annointed be∣fore a warme fornace or fire vpon the place of the disease twice a day: but you are to vse the sweate bath but thrice a weeke, and do this the space of fourtéene dayes. This foresaid salue is good for all scabbines. The salue Dialthaea is fit for this same disease, wherof there be foure kinds described in the third Part, the fourtéenth Chapter, and 4. §. This ensuing is also very requisite: Take liuing Crabs and Earthwormes, of each a like quantitie, dry them in an ouen, and then stamp them to powder, afterwards temper them with as much Swines grease, and make a salue thereof. For this are also good two precious Bl∣sam oyles, whereof the one is described in the second Part, the sixt Chapter, and 4. §. and the o∣ther in the eight Part, beginning: Take Myrrha elected, &c. Item, there is yet more good for this: oyle of Tyles, and oyle of sweet Almonds. This en∣suing is also accompted for sure, and is many times proued. Take Earthwoormes, put them in an earthen pot stopt with a couer on the top, that ye Ants may runne in and out, then set it so in the earth where the Ants abide the space of three or foure dayes, and there will ingender a water of it, with this water annoint the withered limmes very warme, this should be certaine and approued. In case also that the withered members be oftentimes rubbed with distilled Calues-gather water which is described before, then shall one find amendement. But if this lamenesse and extenuation be caused through heate which happeneth seldome, then haue you a bath for it, which shall be prescribed against the Podagra. Item, the salue also of Earthwoormes, of Cassy, and other things moe be meete for this intent, therefore it is néed∣les to write here any further of it, but this foot water following is especially ordained for it. Take Feuerfew, Stechados, and Cowslips, of each one handfull and a halfe, the rootes of E∣ringus, and Mallowes, of each two handfuls, Mather, Hartwoort, of each one handfull and a halfe, Peucedanum halfe a handfull, cut them all grosse and let them séeth together, afterwards wash the féete and the lame hands with it. You may also vse a sweate bath, for that strengthe∣neth the lame ioynts very much.
Of the hardnesse of the Ioynts. §. 4. THere cometh sometimes also a hard swelling in the ioynts, whereby they lose their motion and bowing: for which these plaisters ensuing made hard or soft are to be vsed: Take the grounds of the oyle of Violets which lye beneath in the pot, two ounces, two ounces of the oyle of Lillies, oyle of white Camelina, and oyle of swéet Almonds, of each one ounce and a halfe, Saffron one scruple, Badgers grease one ounce, white Waxe one quarter of an ounce, Rosin as much as will suffise. Item: Take the plaister of Oxycroceum, Sagapenum, Opopanacum, and Ammoniacum, of each halfe a dragme, Rosin thrée quarters of an ounce, white Waxe thrée drag. the gums are to be dissolued in sharpe Vineger, then put the plaister, Waxe, and Rosin vnto it. If there be any hard byles with it, then take Ammoniacum one ounce and a halfe, Pieretrum, and Euphorbium, of each one dragme, Saltpeter halfe a dragme, make a plaister thereof with Waxe and Rosin. Herewith wil we now conclude the third sort of the gout, and come to the fourth sort which is the chiefest. The eight Chapter. Of the Gout or Podagra in the Feet. THe fourth sort of the Gout, as we haue admonished at the first, is the wel knowne Gout of the feet, Podagra: in which we also containe the Gout of the hands Chiragra: for that vnder these two sorts of Gouts there is no great difference, but that the one doth manifest it selfe in the hands, the other in the féete: and this kind of Gout is thus described. Podagra is a defluxion which very painefully assaileth the sinewes with heate and cold, wherewith also the parts adiacent, the ioynts and the legs be plagued with swelling and paine. As much as concerneth the name of this disease, which the Latinists haue taken from the Grecians; this name Podagra is nougth else but a snare wherewith birds be catched by their séete, and therefore is this disease of the Gout likened vnto this instrument, for that it doth catch men by the féete, and holdeth them caught therewith. The Poets do also call this disease Scrupeum Humorem, which is a stonie humour: for that the same will in the hands and féete alter into a stone, so that the same may at last be taken out without any paine: and like as we haue admonished before, this disease commeth not one∣ly in the féete, but also in the hands which is called by the Grecians Chiragra, which is a paine of the hands. The causes of this gout are manifold: to wit inward, and also outward: the outward may be caused through great heate, which causeth the matter to melt. Item, through great idlenes, or through great labor presently after meate: Also through venerie with a full stomacke, and that same especially doth cause the Podagra. Also the learned do certainely affirme, that no man can be plagued with the Podagra, so long as he hath not yet vsed the veneriall act. Galen doth also confirme the same saying, that he neuer knew any man which was infected with the Gout, either of the hands, or féete, before that he hath had to do with women. Daintie ea∣ting and drinking is also a great cause of the Podagra. And that all this is so, we will shew an example. Plinie writeth that these diseases were very strange and new in Italie in his time: for which cause it is named with that outlandish name Podagra. But what made them strange at that time and new, but that at the same time the Romaines liued very moderately in eating & drinking? Hippocrates writeth, that no Eunuch, nor any woman as long as she hath her tearmes, can get the Podagra, neither yet can be bald: Touching which, Galen his interpretor saith, that the same in the time of Hippocrates was true: for that the people in those daies did méetly much labour, and did eate and drinke soberly. But now he saith, that people do lead another life by going idle and rioting: for that one doth find
now adayes Eunuches which be subiect to the gout without lying with any woman at all, which they do get only through their rioting and quaffing. And so is it with women which do also spoile themselues through a disordred life, that they get their termes very litle or not at all. And to the contrarie by measurable labor, by moderat eating and drinking, yea by hunger and abstinence from wine, the Podagra tarrieth away & is left behind, the which I haue séene by a citizen in my time of Landsborough called Lucas Kesselin, who liuing againe according to the pleasure of the world, got the Podagra again. And when he was best in health, then did he ride otherwhiles a horsebacke with two seruants who must lift him vp vpon the horse: but when he came in pouertie and dranke no wine, and liued hardly, then did the Podagra seeke another lodging. So that he being past fiftie yeares old, was faine to trot vp and downe the countrey with a Pedlars packe on his backe ouer high mountaines for to get his liuing. This hath then his originall cause: for if there be no superfluous humors fallen downe in∣to those places, then would there be no paine nor griefe: neither would these defluxions settle themselues in the ioynts if the bodie were not ouercharged with some superfluitie. Now the meane to kéepe the bodie frée from all superfluous humors, is that the bodie be kept with mo∣derate exercise, to the end the meate may be well digested. Hereby appeareth now sufficiently, that the gout is not caused sooner of any thing in the world, than of idlenesse and excessiue riot. When as now the Podagra is caused of any inward occasion, then doth it happen thereby that one hauing weake legs and feete, the matter, whether it be bloud, Cholera, Phlegma, or Me∣lancholia, each alone or mixed, might lightly fall into them, whereby it may well be vnderstood, that the Podagra can be short, long continuing, hote or cold. It is also sometimes an inheritance of the children from the parents, and hath his vertue in both the seedes, and is imparted vnto the children, so that the goutie fathers and mothers may also ingender goutie children. Now may we also write somewhat of the signes which do not onely signifie the goute of the féete or Podagra, but also all paine of the ioynts. If this disease be caused through bloud, then doth it appeare with rednes, & with great con∣tinuall paine and smart: the vrine is thicke and red, the pulse strong and full, and the paine is more in the morning than in the euening. And if the patient be by nature full of bloud and san∣guine, then doth the same paine encrease daily. The same happeneth also when the partie is young, hath liued easily, and if it be in the spring time. The signes, if the gout procéed of Cholera: then is the paine sharpe, the place of the paine is yellowish, the vrine very red and thin, the ordure is also yellow and thin, the pulse is swift, the heate is great, and chiefly on the place of the paine, as one may perceiue the same in féeling of it: all which doth yéeld more assurance if the patient be young and cholericke of nature, and if he haue done great labor before, or if the weather be hote, & he hath taken much hot meat & drink. If this disease come of Phlegma, then is the paine not very great: also the part of the paine is not altered of colour, the vrine is whitish and thicke, the going to stoole is slimie, and the bodie in féeling is alwaies cold. And this manner of goute is commonly alwaies in bodies which be cold of nature, and that in winter time, and after a disordered life in eating and drin∣king. In Melancholicke bodies the Gout cometh very seldome, wherewith is also great paine, the patient will be leane, the vrine thin and crude. And this happeneth commonly in those bo∣dies which be of a melancholicke nature in the beginning of winter. Sometimes this disease procéedeth through wind, whereby is a great and excéeding paine, the which by windy meates is increased and augmented. How the Podagra is to be preuented. §. 1. WHen any one doth perceiue and is assured, that this his sicknes or disease commeth through heate, and that the time be at hand wherein he was wont to be assailed with it, then must he before whilest that he is well or in good estate (if he will by any kind of meanes be fréed) be purged with those medicines which expel Choleram, and must refraine wine, euen as all Phisitions do aduise, and in stead of
these vse some thin meade or drinke, the decoction of Cinnamom: for that meade is not onely good for the Podagra; but also requisite for all infirmities of the ioynts. But if this gout be cau∣sed through hote Cholera, then is Barly water rather commended, or water wherein Prunes be decocted. Item, temper fresh well water also with the iuice of Pomgranats. This also en∣suing may be prepared: Take two ounces of Sugar, one handfull of Barly, Raisins one hand∣full, seeth them together in thrée pints of water vnto the halfe: and if one will drinke wine, then is there one halfe of this foresaid water to be tempered amongst it, or to drink some middle sort of cleare Beere. Further, he must forbeare all Hony meates, and all flesh. Also he is to eate and drinke very litle; but he is to sustaine himselfe with Barly pap, Oaten pap, bread and butter, and such light meates. But what greater damages be found in this disease through surfetting is sufficiently shew∣ed before. The members also which are accustomably plagued with this paine, are to be restrained from ouermuch motion, or from wearying himselfe too much, and that especially if the patient be grosse and full of bloud, and hath not a long time bene let bloud nor purged. Of diuers meanes whereby to free one from the Podagra. §. 2. THese Pils following are very highly commended, as that through the vse of them many gouty people be not onely fréed, but also healed altogether: Take Myrrha, Aloe, Lignum Aloes, Cinnamom, Masticke and Rubarbe, of each one quarter of an ounce, Muscus fiue graines: make 36. or 40. pilles with Oxymel, or as many as you please, whereof you are to take two or thrée euery other day, and to continue thus the space of thirtie daies: afterwards, take euery wéeke once as much more. But if so be that the Podagra do come in the meane while, then are the pils to be vsed after the first manner. First, take Aloe, Rubarbe, Species Hierae Galeni, Pillulae sine quibus, of each one dragme and a halfe, field Cipers foure scruples stéeped in wine: make pils thereof with Lauander water, and vse them as all the rest: they be stronger than the former. These Pils following hath the Emperor Carolus vsed against the Podagra: Take yellow Mi∣robalani Chebuli, and Indi, of each one dragme, oyle of swéet Almonds one quarter of an ounce, the iuice of Roses, of Burrage, and of Fumitorie, of each two ounces: temper them together, and let them stand in stéepe 24. howers, afterwards make it hote, and wring it well out. This being all well done, then stéepe therein againe half an ounce of Rubarbe, Indi Spica halfe a scru∣ple, Malmsey a spoonfull, Woormwood water one ounce: let it then stand thus together stéeped the space of ten howers, and afterwards wring it out hard. Thirdly, take Agaricus one ounce, stone salt foure scruples, Ginger one scruple, Hony of Ro∣ses thrée scruples, Oxymel of Squils one quarter of an ounce: stéepe all together 24. howers in white wine and wring it well out. Fourthly, take Aloe which is washed with Endiue water, and Manna, of each one ounce, fresh Cassie two ounces, Bdellium two scruples, temper them well together in the foresaid boy∣led and stéeped Colatures. Lastly, all being well tempered, then set them all together in the Sunne, stirring it often about, and when it is well dried, then forme pils thereof. Of these pils shall you take one euery morning: they haue a maruellous efficacie in pre∣uenting the Podagra: so that it is said, if one do not ryot, that one shall be holpen thereof in fif∣téene dayes. In the first part of this booke in the twelfth Chapter in the description of the Bal∣sam you haue a very costly salue, beginning thus: Take Bayberries, &c. which fréeth one mar∣uellous much of the Podagra. Item, if one set his féete in warme Smiths water, or foment them ouer the vapor of the same water: it is also very good to chew euery morning a litle Masticke.
How the Podagra is to be purged. §. 3. IF so be that the Podagra be caused only through Cholera and heate, then is this Sirupe following to be prepared: Take Endiue three handfuls, Roses one ounce and a halfe; red, white, and yellow Saunders all together one ounce, seeth it well, and wring it out: then put vnto this decoction twelue ounces of Sugar, and séeth it to a sirupe like as all other sirupes be decocted: giue thereof one ounce and a halfe with En∣diue water foure or fiue times together, and then take these purgations ensuing after it: Take of the Electuarie of the iuice of Roses fiue dragmes with the foresaid water, which is especiall good for the ioynts. Or take fresh Figs halfe an ounce, Currans fiue dragmes, the rinds of yellow Mirobalans one ounce, let them stéepe a whole night, and seeth them a little: then take of this decoction three ounces, and temper therein of the foresaid confection of Roses, and giue it very warme early in the morning. Or if you had rather haue pils, then take Aloe one dragme, Diagridij fiue graines, Roses thrée graines, Hermodactyli halfe a dragme: make pils of it with the iuice of Roses, they be much commended. If there happen great paine with this kind of hot gout, then may two kinds of plaisters be prepared for it, whereof one is to be layd vpon the place of the paine, therewith to stop the de∣fluxion, and the other on the top of it for to asswage the paine. The first is thus made: Take Mirtle séed, the séed of Ruscus and Bolus, of each halfe an ounce, red and white Saunders, the iuice of Sloes, Pomegranat blossomes and péeles, Gals, of each one dragme, Rose water and Plantaine water, of each thrée dragmes, oyle of Roses one ounce and a halfe, Barly meale as much as will suffice for to make a plaister or pap. The other: Take red and white Saunders, Starch, and washt Ceruse, of each one quarter of an ounce, Poppie séed halfe an ounce, Camfer one scruple, oyle of Roses thrée ounces, vnsalted Butter one ounce and a halfe, the séed of Flea∣wort one dragme and a halfe, and two yolks of egs, temper them all together, and lay them vpon it as is before said. An easier. Take the oyle of Roses thrée ounces, Vineger halfe an ounce, temper them all together, and annoynt the place of the paine with it; it asswageth the paine, and hindereth the defluxion. Now when as these defluxions do first of all begin, then be Salues, Oyles, and other things moe vsed and applyed vnto it, for which you may take one of these ensuing which you please: Take small pouned Bolus two ounces, Rose water, and the water of Nightshade, of each one ounce, two or thrée drops of Vineger; temper them well together, and strike it thereon with a feather, or dip a cloth in it and lay it ouer the swelling: when it is dry, then take fresh, but al∣wayes warme. Item, take oyle of Roses, seeth Earthwormes in it: Mastick is also especiall good. This following should be a speciall secret: seeth Earthwormes and Frogs in oyle of Roses vntill they be almost all consumed, then wring them out hard through a cloth, and an∣noynt it very warme on the place of the paine. This ensuing is not vnlike to the former: Take of the oldest Sallad oyle that you can get, twelue ounces, and twelue water Frogs, chop them very small and seeth them well: when they be almost sodden ynough, then temper therewith the iuice of Housleeke, and the iuice of Stonecrop, of each two ounces; then let it seeth so long, vntill that the moisture be wasted away; afterwards wring it out, and vse it as before. Some doe commend aboue all things the muscilage of Frogs to be layd warme vnto it, which is thus made: Take in the Spring greene Frogs before they begin to cast their sperme, take out the bowels, and hang them on a thred to dry in the Sunne vntill they begin to be somewhat dry, then powre Sallad oyle vnto them, and let them seeth meetly well together, then wring them out, it is especiall good for the sinewes. Item, take Badgers grease, and Turpentine, of each one ounce, Frankinsence halfe an ounce, Waxe as much as will suffice for to make a salue of it. Or take Poplar salue two ounces, small pouned Bolus, and oyle of Roses, of each halfe an ounce, temper them together vnto a salue. This ensuing is also good for it: Take foure yolks of egs, Saffron one dragme, oyle of Roses two ounces, temper them well together, and vse them as before. A principall good one: Take Vyne Snailes as many as you will, put them into a pot, and lay a tin lid vpon it; afterwards whelme the same pot ouer another pot, and then set it ouer the fire to the end that they may rost by little and little. This being done, the oyle wil drop
into the nethermost pot, and with this oyle annoynt the hot gouts thorowly. Item, séeth ten egs very hard, cut them ouerthwart, fill the whites with pouned Mirrhe; afterwards binde thē togither againe, & lay them the space of 15. daies in a seller, or longer, then will a water drop out of it, which you may annoint vpon the gout as a salue. In like manner fresh Cassie is also much commended, with the muscilage of Fleawort, for all paine of the ioynts through heate. This ensuing asswageth the paine maruellously: Take the séed of Fleawort two ounces, seeth it in sufficient water vntill it be very slimie, afterwards wring it out very hard through a cloth: In this muscilage or slime melt one ounce and a halfe of Waxe, Sallad oyle thrée oun∣ces, let it then séeth a good while, stirring it alwayes equally about vntill it be cold. Another of like force: Take oyle of Walfloures two ounces, oyle of swéete Almonds, and oyle of Camelina, of each one ounce and a halfe, Butter one ounce, Saffron one dragme and a halfe, white waxe one ounce and a halfe, Dill séed, Cammomill, and Ducks grease, of each halfe an ounce, thrée yolks of Egs, then temper them one amongst another, and make a salue thereof. Item, take wheate bran two handfuls, Vinecuict as much as will suffice for to make a poultesse of it, Salt one quarter of an ounce: let it séeth a little together, and then lay it warme vpon it, you shall hardly finde any thing else that doth more asswage the paine. Item, take Barly meale or Pease meale, and pouned Roses, of each thrée ounces, white wine as much as will suffice for to make pap thereof, then let it séeth a good while: if you will, you may also put a dragme of Mastick vnto it. Some do séeth Bran in thrée parts of water and one part of vineger, and so lay it vpon it, and let it lye fiue or sixe howres vpon it. This also ensuing is thought to asswage all paine whatsoeuer: Take thrée ounces of vnripe Sallad oyle, Saffron one dragme, foure yolks of egs, oyle of Roses foure ounces: let the oyle séeth a good while, and when it beginneth to be cold, then temper the yolks amongst it, stirring it alwayes well about: afterwards Starch and Barly meale of each one ounce and a halfe, and at the last Saffron: if you will haue it more forcible, then put Butter vnto it and Bdellium, of each one dragme: then stéepe them all together vntill the same be thorowly consumed, and af∣terwards temper the rest with it. Item, take the crums of white bread, stéepe them a good while in swéete milke, and then seeth them together to pap: now when it beginneth to coole, then tem∣per a yolke or two of egs amongst it, and a little oyle of Roses, and so lay it vpon the swelling and paine. Some do temper Butter, Ducks or Goose grease, and Sugar also amongst it. Another: Take Plantaine séed, and Linséed, of each two handfuls, séeth them very soft vn∣till all the water be almost gone, then temper amongst it crums of white bread as much as you please: afterwards stamp them well together, and temper it with the oyle of Roses: and when the paine is very great, then is the iuice of cooling herbs to be tempered amongst it, yea very well thrée or foure greynes of Opium, and one dragme of Saffron, like as the same may be very well done in the foresaid crums of white bread. This also following is very good: Take Cammomill, and Melilot, of each one ounce, Mal∣lowes, and Hollyhock rootes, of each halfe a handfull, Fenegréeke meale, Linséed meale, and Barly meale, of each one ounce: cut the herbs small, and séeth them mellow: afterwards wring them out, and stampe them well: last of all, mingle with the said meales oile of Roses, and oyle of Cammomill, of each fiue ounces or more, then make pap therewith, and lay it ouer the paine, & renew the same oftentimes. Item, séeth wheate meale and red wine to pap in fresh swéet milke: for this, is also good Beane meale decocted to pap in fresh sweet milke. These foure oyles following be also commonly vsed for the gout: to wit, oyle of Lillies, of Cammo∣mill, of swéet Almonds, and of Walfloures, with which we do commonly temper Cassie ex∣tracted with vineger, like as before there is also mention made of the oyle of Poplar buds. Or take pouned Henbane séed, put it into a bag, and let it warme well, and so lay it vpon the paine. Item, in great outward paine take Cowmilke sixe ounces, Opium halfe a scruple, crums of Rye bread, and these being well powdred as much as you please, make a soft plaister of it. In like manner you may also vse the iuice of Nightshade and of Plantaine being tempe∣red all together, or each apart. By all these foresaid remedies may easily be marked, that all these simple things following be especiall good for the hot Podagra: as namely, Nightshade, Housleeke, Lettice, Endiue, Mirtus,
Muscilage of Fleawort, Vineger, Rose water, Bolus, &c. in the 16. Chapter, and 4. §. of the hot kidneys. Of the cold gout or Podagra and of his paine. §. 4. IF there be found with the paine of the ioynts, neither rednes nor heate, and the patient be of a cold nature, and that one be cold in the féeling, then may it easily be perceiued that the cause procéedeth of cold. For this the patient is to prepare himselfe to purge with these potions following: Take Sage, Cowslips, and field Cipers, of each one handfull: seeth them all together in sufficient water vntill the third part be wasted. Vnto this decoction put twelue ounces of Sugar, and then make a clarified sirupe of it. If the matter be fluxible of it selfe, then is this following to be prepared: Take Calmus and Gentian, of each two ounces, Hartwoort one ounce, Saint Iohns woort, Sage, field Cipers, Cowslips, Bayberries and Chamaedrios, of each one handfull, Annis, Fennell, and Pionie séede, of each one ounce, Basil séede, Cinnamome, of each half an ounce, séeth them all together in sufficient water euen to the halfe: afterwards wring it out, and make it with sixe ounces of Hony, and nine ounces of Sugar vnto a clarified sirupe; giue then one ounce and a halfe with some distilled water in the morning fasting. For a purgation is this following to be vsed: Take Turbith halfe an ounce, Hermodactyli one quarter of an ounce, Diagridij one dragme, Masticke halfe a scruple, Sugar one ounce: then make a powder of it, and giue thereof the fourth part at once, but no more, for that it is very strong. If you wil, you may make pils thereof without the Sugar: but the pils of Hermodactyli exceed all other pils, viz. in purging all phlegmaticke humors. They haue also an astringent vertue, whereby they ob∣struct the conduits where the defluxions take their course. Treacle and Mithridate are to be ta∣ken of goutie men one dragme, or one dragme and a halfe with great auaile twice a weeke. Item: Take field Cipers powned small halfe a dragme, Turpentine thrée dragmes: temper them together, and take it with a wafer, or with fresh broth: it is also good for all lamenesse. These patients are also to be bathed and fomented with this ensuing: Take Sage, Rosemary, Penniroyall Rue, Mints, Horehound, Marioram gentle, Marioram, Lauander, and Pomgra∣nate péeles, of each one handfull, séeth them all together in good wine: afterwards straine the broth through a cloth, and put three ounces of butter vnto it, and then put the féet therein, whe∣ther it be with paine or without paine, and lay the decocted herbes very warme vpon it. Item, when the place of the paine is fomented with boyled Fenegréeke, then will the paine be thereby asswaged. Or take stinging Nettles, séeth them in water and foment with the dampe of the same, and so lay the herbes warme vpon it. The oyle of Foxes is also maruellous good for the Podagra, and for all paine of the ioynts, like as is also the oyle of Tiles, and oyle of Sulphur, which be both hote and piercing. Hereafter do mo plaisters and other things insue to be laid vpon it: and that after the place of the disease hath bene fomented or annointed with any salue, and the affluxe of humours is somewhat ceased: Take boyled Alehoofe and lay it therein and hold still the feete. Further, it is much aduised, that for the cold Podagra, there shall be two kinds of Plaisters prepared. First, take Cipers nuts, Mastick, Myrrhe, and Frankinsence, of each one quarter of an ounce, Gum, Dragagant, of each thrée dragmes, Sage water sixe ounces. Vineger halfe an ounce: powne all small that are to be powned, and then make a meetely soft pap of it, or a plaister with Barley meale, and lay it vpon the place of the paine. Another: Take the muscilage of Fenegréeke, and of Linséede, of each one ounce, salt Butter, oyle of wite Camelina, or oyle of , and burnt ashes of Colewoort stalkes, of each two oun∣ces, Waxe as much as will suff to make a plaister or salue of it: lay it or spread it vpon the paine of the disease, it asswageth paine: the plaister Diachilon is also to be vsed for it. Item, take soft Storax, Beuercod, Euphorbium, Myrrha, Aloe, and the iuice of Sloes, of each a like quantitie, Wine as much as you please: let it séeth well together, and then wet a cloth therein and lay ouer it. Or dip a cloth in the warme decoction of Ebulus. Before certaine plai∣sters are described, of the crums of white bread: temper with one of the same one dragme and a halfe, or two dragmes of the powder of Hermodactyli, and so lay vpon it. Item, séeth Onions in water, and make a cloth wet in it and lay it thereon. Or rost certaine Onions, stampe them very small, spread it on a cloth and lay it thereon. The common people do vse Cow dung, and lay it thereon in stead of a plaister. Also the di∣stilled
Cowdung may be laid vpon it. Item, take the decoction of Rape, and lay it thereon. You are also to powne Turneps, and to temper them with oyle of Roses, and to lay the same vpon it. In like manner temper sodden, stamped and well salted Turneps, with about so much Bran as Turneps, & with sufficient oyle of Violets, make a plaister of it. Item, take a bag filled with Linseede: seeth it well, and lay it ouer the paine. These be now simple things which warme the ioynts; to wit, S. Iohns woort, Hermodactyli, Ammoniacum, Euphorbium, Myrrha, Squils, Asara∣bacca, Beuercod, liquid Storax, Cresses, Cowdung, Marioram, Mints, white Mustard séed, Pine apples, Capers rootes, field Cipers, Cammomill, Elecampane rootes, Gailia, Radish, Rue, Sagapenum, and Vineger of Squils, &c. Some do aduise, that for the Podagra there be made an issue, which is a running hole into the leg, which is alwaies to be kept open, whereby the matter may haue issue. How this is to be done, shall be taught in the sixt Part, in the discourse of the Plague. Others do raise blisters the breadth of foure fingers vnder the knées on the outside of the leg, opening the same, and letting the water to run out: whereof we haue in other places mo of this booke made declaration. An especiall and well approued remedie for the Gout. §. 5. FIrst is this powder to be prepared: Take two kinds of Chamedryos, which is field Cypers and Chamedryos, Gentian, Centorie flowers, Rapontica, the right Aristologia rotunda, (wherof is sufficient store brought out of Switzerland) of ech a like much; stampe each apart: afterwards temper them together, and vse it thus. After the necessarie purgation, whereof we haue sufficiently spoken be∣fore, take the space of fortie daies together, one dragme euery morning of this said powder in the Sommer time with small Beere, and in Winter with Wine or Meade: Afterwards vse no more but halfe a dragme, and so prosecute this course the space of a whole yeare. If so be that the bodie be bound in the meane while, then is the patient to vse twice euery moneth these pils following: take Masticke, Myrrhe, Cinnamom, Aloe, and Rubarbe, of each one scruple; being all powned small, then make ten pils thereof with hony of Roses, and take two or thrée at once. They be very weake, so that one may vse the more thereof if he please. In the meane while the patient must order himself very moderatly in eating & drinking. Through this be many goutie persons throughly healed of the Podagra. The direction for the Gout sent to Charles the Emperor. §. 6. THis aduice or remedie was sent to the Emperor Charles his Maiestie of famous memorie, from Francisco Toralto a Lord in the kingdome of Naples, who had lien most miserably the space of fourteene yeares of the Gout: Take cleane milke of a blacke Goate, and turne it with Figmilke, or if you haue it not, wherewith you will: straine out the whay, and let the rest seeth in an earthen pot; scum it well, and let of thrée parts twaine seeth away, & then straine it once againe, to the end there remaine no curds in it at all: afterwards, take the vppermost of Burrage a good part, and according to that there is much whay, with some other things moe which be meete for the Podagra, and according to that th gra doth procéede through heate or cold, let it stéepe well therein: afterwards straine it thorough a cloth, and drinke of it once or twice a day. But if so be that the paine be intolerable great, then stéepe in the foresaid whay wherein the Burrage and other things be stéeped, one drag. or one drag. and a halfe of Agaricus: Take of this whay ten or twelue ounces according to the quality of the sicknes, and according as he can easily go to stoole, and temper amongst it Oxymel of hony of Roses, or (which is bet∣ter) Oxymel of Squils two ounces: you are to drink of it in the morning as warme as you can, and to fast foure howers after it at least. Further, he is in the meane time to exercise himselfe with walking and going: afterwards he is during the space of fiue or sixe daies to drink of this whay without Agaricus, and that is to be done once euery moneth. And he is especially to indeuor himselfe to drinke this in winter, for that it is sufficient if he
do this twice a yeare. And this is especially to be done when one perceiueth that the Podagra is instant, thereby to be frée: and although it appeared alreadie, yet are you to proceed forward with it. What remedies are then to be vsed for it, may be seene and chosen out of the foremen∣tioned things. The letting of bloud must be principally in the beginning of yt spring, and before the paine ariseth; like as one may sée and reade more at large in the 2. §. But aboue all things is a good diet commended: for if the same be not kept, then may all o∣ther things helpe but litle. This is now the principallest and the total of all, that Toraltus com∣municated to the Emperors Maiestie. The order of diet which is to be obserued in this disease, may you perceiue by all that which hath bene said before, whereof also you shall find all things more amply described in the begin∣ning of the sixt Chapter, where we haue discoursed of the paine of the hips, that aboue all other things, Wine is chiefly forbidden vnto all goutie people, as hath bene before expressed. The decoction of Cinnamom, Meade, &c. are they to drinke, as is there admonished. When any one doth go but ill after the Goute of the feete. §. 7. THis debilitie of the féete doth sufficiently shew, that there is still some flegmaticke matter present which ought to be expelled, whereto these pils ensuing are to be prepared: Take prepared Aloe halfe an ounce, Coloquint one dragme, Diagri∣dion halfe a dragme, Hermodactyli halfe an ounce: temper them all together, and make seuen pils of one dragme thereof: Afterwards, take euery fourtéene daies sixe thereof, and fast sixe howers vpon it. In the meane time is he alwaies the fift day to take one of them before supper. Secondly, he is to vse this Confection following: Take Species de Xiloaloe, Species Diatrion∣pipereon, of each one drag. white Saunders, Violet and Sorrell séede, of each one scrup. Sugar sixe ounces decocted in water of Asarabacca, or water of Parsley: make Sugar plates thereof, and then take daily before noone and after noone, or at leastwise once a day of it, three dragmes at the least, and continue this the space of one whole moneth. Thirdly, take one pint and a halfe of Smiths water and seeth therein fiftéene or sixtéene Ci∣pers nuts, forty or fiftie Gals, Hermodactyli, and Pionie rootes, of each one ounce, vntill the third part be wasted away. He is afterwards to rub the sicke person from the knees vnto the soles of the feete, letting it be made moist, to wit, once a day alwaies before meate. Fourthly, take vnripe Sallad oyle one ounce, Sandaraca, Masticke, and burnt Iuorie, of each one dragme: temper this together, and therewith annoint after the former rubbing, all the parts very warme which be weakened through the Gout, and continue it thus with rubbing vntill they be thorougly strengthened againe, and grow to be well. Fiftly, when the sicke person hath vsed certaine dayes to wash and annoint, and findeth ne∣uertheles no perfect amendement: then is this salue following to be vsed, like as the other pre∣cedent: Take Dragon bloud, fine Bolus, Sandaraca, the iuice of Sloes, Mastick, Frankinsence, and Myrrhe, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sealed earth and Starch, of each one ounce, the iuice of Plantaine, and of Roses of each one ounce and a halfe: then temper them a long time together in a mortar vnto a salue. These be now the very best and necessariest remedies, which of all ancient and later Phisiti∣ons be prescribed for al the ioynts of the bodie, God almighty the chiefe and best Phisition giue his blessing vnto it. What things they be which conuey the medicines towards the ioynts. §. 8. AMongst al other things which be written of the ioynts, we haue yet to speake of this: which be the things that conuey the medicines towards the ioynts: amongst which, the chiefest that are to be estéemed, be rosted Squils, Ginger, Calmus, which is the right Acorus, Penniroyall, Opopanax, both of the kinds of Germander, the séed A∣momum, and other moe.
The ninth Chapter. Of the outward accidents of the ioynts and members. FRom the third Chapter hitherto we haue discoursed of many kindes of diseases of the outward members, which are most of all caused through outward causes and defluxions: here will we now in this last Chapter adde certaine outward accidents; as, when the outward members or ioynts be beaten or strained. Secondly, we will also admonish somwhat of ye fracture of the bones. And because that by this there falleth otherwhiles some putrifaction of the bones, therefore will we here also discourse somewhat of it: and be∣cause that all this cannot be effected without great paine, we will shew withall, how that the same paine is to be asswaged. Lastly, how that the numbnesse and vnsensiblenesse of the members may be preuented and cured. Of strayned members. §. 1. IF any one haue strained any one member through falling or beating, and the same hapned to swell without great heate, then take the salue Dialthaea one ounce, oyle of Cammomill and of Dill, of each halfe an ounce, Waxe a little, and annoint the place therewith. Another: Take salue of Agrippa, of Althaea, and of the white salue which fol∣loweth hereafter, of each halfe an ounce; temper them together, and annoint the place affected with it: for which the Alablaster salue is also good. Item, take Barly meale, Fenegréeke and Linséede, of each one ounce, Mallowes one hand∣full, Wormwood halfe a handfull, Cammomill and Melilot, of each one handfull and a halfe: the herbes and flowers are you to séeth well, and then to séeth the meale amongst it: then are you with oyle of Roses to make a soft plaister or pap of it. Item, take Beane meale thrée oun∣ces, Cammomill, Roses, Wormwood, and Bran, of each one handfull: the herbes and flowers are you to seeth to pap in good red wine: at last, let the Bran also séeth with it, and then with oyle of Roses make a pap or plaister of it. For this disease, it is also good to open the liuer veine, and to let out fiue or sixe ounces of bloud according to the abilitie of the patient. You may also lay fresh Cowdung vpon this disease, and annoint the place about it with Bolus which is tem∣pered with vineger. The expert Phisitions do aduise, that Cow dung should be tempered a∣mongst oyle of Roses. Item, take the whites of Egs brayed well, and temper amongst it the powder of Worme∣wood as much as you please, and so lay them vpon the brused place. The golden waters are also commended for this, but they be hote: but if so be that there be great heate with it, then néede not one stay to open the veine, like as we haue said before. But these diseases would be alwaies suppressed with cooling things: for which you haue fiue kinds of white salues: Take Sallad oyle thrée quarters of an ounce, white Waxe, and Ceruse, of ech two ounces, the white of an egge: the waxe and oyle are to be melted by a soft fire, and after∣wards to be well tempered with the Ceruse, and the white of the egge. This is not onely good for brused members, but taketh away all the blew spots which be come of fals, blowes, and such like occasions. This is the common white salue which is alwaies readie at the Apotheca∣ries, and is called Vnguentum Album. The other salue. If so be that you desire to haue this forementioned salue more cooling, then temper half a dragme of Camfere well amongst it, and this is then called at the Apothecaries Vnguentum Camphoratum. The third white salue with Camfere. Take sixe ounces of ye oyle of Roses, the whites of thrée egs brayed well, white waxe one ounce and a halfe, Ceruse sixe ounces, Camfer broken in Rosewater one dragme: melt the oyle and the waxe together, and then afterwards temper the Camfer and the whites of egs a∣mongst it: afterwards put the Ceruse vnto it brused very small, bruse litharge of Gold washt in Rosewater one dragme and a halfe, washt Ceruse halfe an ounce and halfe a dragme, oyle of
Roses thrée ounces and a half, white waxe about thrée quarters of an ounce: then melt the oyle and the waxe together, and temper the Ceruse and Litharge amongst it vntill it be thoroughly cold. All these foresaid vnguents do coole all hote swellings, of whatsoeuer causes the same may procéed: they do repell all raw places, and they do also coole all the heate of scalding or bur∣ning. The fift is vnguentum de Cerusa, whereof we haue admonished so often in this booke. The same is thus described by Mesua: Take Ceruse, and litharge of Gold, of each three quarters of an ounce, burnt lead, litharge of Siluer, of each halfe an ounce, Mastick, Frankinsence, of each two dragmes & a halfe, oyle of Roses and Vineger, as much as suffiseth for a salue: first powre the drie things into the mortar, and rub it very small: afterwards powre some Vineger, then some oyle vnto it, stirring it well alwaies about vntill it be thicke enough. This salue is also good for all salt Phlegma, and for all drie itch. Of the fractures of bones. §. 2. THese fractures of bones do the Grecians call Catagma. And although the set∣ting, splinting, and binding of this fracture, and what else belongeth vnto it, concerneth more the Chirurgians than Phisitions; notwithstanding doth our common order and method aske a meanes whereby this disease might be hol∣pen. Of which there is not a little spoken before, where we haue discoursed of the lamed, extenuated, brused, and strained members, which all together with the fractures of bones haue a great communion, because they be also caused through such like occasions. First of all it happeneth oftentimes in this fracture, that the marrow in the bones (whereby they be sustained and nourished) is consumed and dryed away: for which, you haue a salue in the second Part and the fourth Chapter, of the marrow of a yong Fole, which is mar∣uellous good for it. In like manner there is also described before in the seuenth Chapter, and 2. §. yet one more of the marrow of a Stone horse, and other moe which be there recited for the exte∣nuation of the members, and all that is necessarie for such like accidents. You haue likewise foure kinds of Dialthaea salues in the third part, the thirtéenth Chapter and 4. §. which be alto∣gether méete for this. Neither is the crooke backe or crooked breast ought else but an eluxation or fracture of the backe bone and ribs, as in the second Part may appeare at large, which may there be séene. The plaister of a Ram is maruellously commended for this, which is described in the third part, the third Chapter, and 1. §. And for to augment the remedies which may serue for these fractures, we will adde plai∣sters, salues, sparadraps, applications, and all kind of things that are requisite for the fracture of the bones, which the Chirurgians may vse. Take Waxe fiue ounces and a halfe, Ammoniacum and Galbanum, of each two ounces: dis∣solue the Gum in Vineger, straine them thorough a cloth, let it seeth vntill the Vineger be wa∣sted away, and melt the Waxe amongst it. Then take Cammomill, Balme with the rootes, and Mallowes, of each one handfull: chop them and stampe them well, afterwards seeth them in two pound of May butter, and a pound and a halfe of Dogs grease, as long as one may séeth an egge hard: this being done, wring it out hard and stirre the molten Waxe with the gums amongst it. When it is almost cold, then take one ounce and a halfe of Beuercod, oyle of Cammomill two ounces and a halfe, of Bayes sixteene ounces, temper all together and keepe it in a pot: this salue do the Chirurgians estéeme to be an especiall secret. And if you will vse it, then take not too much at one time; make it warm and rub well the place with it: afterwards lay this feare cloth following vpon it. Take Waxe thrée ounces, Rosin one ounce and a halfe, Masticke one ounce, Galbanum, and Frankinsence, of each thrée quarters of an ounce: dissolue the Galbanum in a little Vineger; stampe all that is to be stamped; melt the Waxe and Rosin in an ounce of oyle: straine it after∣wards thorough a cloth, and haue a cloth readie as big as the feare cloth must be. Lastly, soke it therein, and after the annointing apply it vpon the place affected. Others: take foure ounces of Sallad oyle, melt therein halfe an ounce of Waxe: when it is almost cold, then stir halfe an ounce of powned Masticke amongst it, and vse it as before. Item: Take white Waxe, and Frankinsence, of each halfe an ounce, of oyle of Linséed foure ounces: melt them all together and draw a cloth thorough it. Item: Take Waxe and fresh
Butter, of each a like quantitie, melt them together: these two be especiall good against all swellings. Another: Take Fenegréeke meale as much as you please: séeth it in water and put powned Comfery vnto it, vntill it be as it were grout, then apply it to the fracture. Item: Take litharge of Gold, fine Bolus, and Comfery, of each thrée ounces, Beane meale one ounce and a half: powne them all together, and powre good Vineger vnto it, and let it stand so one night: afterwards put molten Waxe and Rosin vnto it, of each thrée ounces, Sallad oile twelue ounces, then temper them all together on the fire, and let it séeth well vntill that the Vineger be consumed: When it is almost cold, then stir two ounces of powned Dragagant stée∣ped in Wine or Vineger amongst it, that it be like vnto Gelly. Or take Rosin fiue ounces, Saf∣fron, Euphorbium, and long pepper, of each one dragme, Aqua vitae one ounce and a halfe, stamp all that is to be stamped: dissolue the Rosin in Aqua vitae, and then let it séeth all together vn∣till that the Aqua vitae be boyled away, then take Waxe as much as is néedfull for a plaister: this plaister is also very good for all other ruptures. Item: Take Turpentine, and Waxe of each 4. ounces, Galbanum thrée quarters of an ounce, Ammoniacum halfe an ounce: dissolue the gums in wine, and then temper them all together: when it is almost cold, then put one quarter of an ounce of Myrrhe, and as much Turpentine vnto it, and make a plaister of it. In like manner you haue in the third Part, and the third Chap. one more beginning thus: Take Dragon bloud, &c. And yet one othe n the second part, the third Chapter, and 5. §. beginning thus: Take Pitch, &c. Item, one more in the first Part, the fift Chapter, and 1. §. which be all together very good for the fractures of bones. For the putrifaction of the bones. §. 3. TAke burnt Lead two ounces, Myrrhe half an ounce, Aloe, Opopanacum, Iron drosse, burnt Squinant, and the rinds of the Fir trée, of each one dragme, then make a powder of it, and strew it vpon the putrified bone: for it separateth the same, and healeth maruellously. Take Canterburie bels, powne them small, and strew this powder also vpon it. The same operation hath the water also wherein Sal Armoniacke is decocted. Here follow some especiall things for the paine of the ioynts. §. 4. IT happeneth also otherwhiles, that in the vttermost parts of the members, as in the hands and féete, there commeth great paine, whether it be of the foresaid causes, or of somthing else that hath fallen, or bene laid vpon them, which may well be caused both of heate and cold. But if so be that heate cause this paine, then doth it appeare with rednesse, with hardnesse, and with swelling, which is also a signe of some impostume to come. But if it be caused through cold, then is the paine without any rednes or heat: but with deafenesse, pensiuenesse, palenesse, and sometime with a drie itching scurffe. When as these signes be present, they giue commonly to vnderstand, that there might follow of it a palsey or Paralysis, and an extinguishment of all naturall heate. If this disease come through some outward causes, then looke on the same parts, whether they be redder than any other. Then is it to be annointed with cooling oyles, as with oyle of Roses, of Violets, of water Lillies, and such like. The letting of bloud is very good for this: as if the paine be in the féete, then open the veine in the arme on the same side, &c. If it be caused through drith, and that neither rednes nor whitenes can be perceiued, and neuertheles the member séemeth to be paler from day to day: then let warme water fall from on high vpon it, and afterwards let it be annointed with the salue which is molten together of oyle and white Waxe. But if you will haue this salue stronger, then vse that Anodinon which is described in the se∣cond part, the fift Chapter, and 18. §. or any other which be specified in the paine of the Podagra. But if the place be somewhat greater or swollen vp, & that in feeling it be found somwhat col∣dish,
then is it to be rubbed oftentimes with warme clothes that ye pores or vents might open; and afterwards let this fomenting following be made ready: Take Cammomill, Marioram, & Stechados, of each one handfull; séeth them, and hold the member ouer the vapour. Or take a sponge being made wet therein, and so lay it warme vpon it: you must also let warme water drop vpon it from on high: Afterwards annoint the member with oyle of Walflowers, of Co∣stus, of Lillies, or any such like, which be warme by nature. In eating and drinking he is to keepe himselfe sober, and to exercise himselfe much, and to bath. And if so be that this will not helpe sufficiently, then is he to be purged of all flegmaticke humors, as with the pils de Hermo∣dactylis, Foetidis, and Medicamine Turbith. Lastly, and in néede he is to vse those things which be described in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, and 13. §. of Paralysis. Of the vnsensiblenesse, shaking, and numbnesse of the Limmes. §. 5. OF all these diseases we haue in the first part very largely and amply written: likewise also euery where in the fourth part: which meanes may also be vsed in all these accidents: but especially there be very good for this two sure golden wa∣ters, which shall be hereafter described in the last part amongst other vitall wa∣ters, whether it be that they be vsed outwardly, or drunke inwardly: for they be good for all diseases of the outward members and ioynts, like as is this also following: Take drie Willow wood, and burne it in two pots one aboue the other, like as the oyle of Iuniper wood is woont to be made, and with the oyle that runneth out into the neather∣most pot, annoint the place affected the space of nine daies. Another: Take Quinces which rot vpon the trée, Beuercod, Bayberries, Sage, and Iuni∣per berries, of each a like quantitie: stampe them, and cut them méetly grosse: afterwards séeth it all together in good wine, and then rub the ioynts with it. These two things aforesaid be very highly commended of the common people. If so be that there be any thing discouered, not onely that concerneth the fractures of the bones, but also this whole fourth part of the ioynts and outward members, wherein may be any want: thereof must aduice be had with expert Phisitions and Chirurgians, and so we will conclude therewith this fourth Part. The fift Part of this booke comprehendeth all the Accidents and Diseases, which do spread themselues abroad ouer the whole bodie. IN the foresaid foure parts we haue most of all described all outward and inward parts of mans bodie, with all their accidentall disea∣ses: this fift part shall discourse of those things which spread them∣selues abroade ouer the whole bodie: amongst which, outwardly is the skinne, which couereth the whole bodie: inwardly are the veines, the bloud, flesh, sinewes and bones. Item, other acciden∣tall things moe, as heate, cold, Phlegma, Melancholia, fatnes, lean∣nesse, sléepe, sweate, and such like. To the Skinne will we ascribe many kinds of diseases, to wit, what may hurt the same inwardly and outwardly: as all Impo∣stumes, Vlcers, or Byles, Warts, Spots, Blisters, Clefts, Itchings, Scurfe, Swellings, Varices, Carbuncles, and such like. Item many other corroding vlcers, as Fistulac, Cankers, Gangrene, Pocks, Leprosie, Cacoëtes, and many other incurable vlcers. Afterwards we will discourse of such things as hurt the skinne on the outside, as burning or scalding by fire, by water, or gunpowder, splints, thornes, all kind of wounds, and whatsoeuer may ap∣pertaine
vnto them. Lastly, of Cicatrices, which be left behind after the cure of the forementio∣ned accidents. The first Chapter. Of the Skin. THe Skin is by nature giuen to all liuing creatures that haue bloud in them, not onely for an ornament and defence, but also as a garment of the whole bodie, which in one place is found thicker, thinner, and lofter than in another. The outwardmost skin is of it selfe insensible, and more fine and thin in mankind, than in any other creature. The skin within the hand, on the forehead, and for the most part ouer the whole face, and on the héeles, can hardly be fleyed off, by reason that they be throughout knit and wouen with sinewes and muscles. In like manner, if there be no flesh with it, & that it were wounded, it would not be possible to heale the same together againe; like as may be séene in the eye lids, in the foreskin, and other places mo of the bodie. What diseases or accidents this skin is subiect to, we haue discouered it before, and will also write somewhat more of it hereafter. Of the inward causes which harme the Skin. §. 1. FOrasmuch as this fift part of our practise of Phisicke doth not discourse of any o∣ther matter but of vlcers, anguishes, impostumations, and such like accidents which harme the skin: therefore we will discourse and write somewhat of it in ge∣nerall at the first, notwithstanding the difference which is betwéene the vlcers and impostumes; like as in the third part, the 11. Chap. and 29. §. is declared. Thus will we vnder the name of impostumations containe all that procéedeth and follow∣eth after, which the Phisitions do thus describe. An impostume is a disease or maladie, which altereth one member or part of the body from his naturall kind, into an vnnaturall constitution. Or an impostume is an vnnaturall Tumor or swelling of a member, through wind, bloud, or water, which hath drawne one of these mat∣ters vnto it. This impostume may be caused of all the foure humors, and also of a seuerall humor, or of a mixed humor, and that in this maner: When any part is badly qualified, be it of what∣soeuer cause it will, or that any bad humors, winds, waters, or other superfluities haue accesse from any other part which is stronger than that whither they be sent, which is not able enough to expell the affluent humors from him: then there do they remaine, and putrifie, and at the last impostumate. When as such kinds of impostumes be caused onely of bloud, then do the Grecians call it Phlegmonem, which is an hot swelling, with great paine and beating. For if any swellings be caused through Phlegma, or any other waterish moisture, then be they called Oedema, and it is a soft tumor without paine, and it is sometimes séene in dead bodies, in hydropicall persons, and in those parts which are extenuated. If any swelling be caused through pure Cholera, then is the same called Ersiypelas, which is the Rose. Of Melancholia commeth a hard swelling called Schirrus, the Canker and such like: which maladies do mixe themselues oftentimes with diuers other swellings, vlcers, and such like: as we shall especially write hereafter, and discourse of diuers and sundrie of them. But (as is said) we will begin with the first.
Of the Warts. §. 2. HOw ill fauoured this excrescence of ye skin is to the sight, is sufficiently knowne vnto all men, whereof there be also many kinds, some altogether drie, hard, blacke, and cleft or chopt: others be moist, running, itchie, and where paine is to be felt in handling them. Their principall cause is a very burnt melancho∣licke bloud. Therefore ought such things first to be vsed as withstand the in∣gendring of melancholicke bloud, as we haue elsewhere shewed, and shall here∣after declare more at large. But amongst the things which may outwardly be vsed, be these following: Take Willow rinds and burne them to ashes; afterwards mixe it with sharpe vineger, and annoint the warts with it, especially if they stand in a secret place, or rub them with Asses milke, afterwards lay the foresaid on them being spread vpon a cloth, then will they fall off without paine. Item: Take the iuice of Celandine, and the iuice of Purslaine, of each one ounce, oyle of Sulphure one dragme and a halfe: then temper them together, and annoint them therewith. The same doth also oyle of Sulphure alone: Take the iuice of Marigolds, and temper it with salue vnto a plaister. Some do take Cranes eyes, and temper them with the iuice of Onions and Salt vnto a plaister, and so bind vpon it. It is also said that red sealing Waxe is very good for it: Take a garden Snaile, strew it with Salt, put it into a glasse, then cometh there an oyle of it in the space of two daies, then annoint the warts therewith and they will fall off. You may also annoint them with the oyle of Camelina. If they be so great that they may be tyed with a horse haire or any strong silken thréed, then tye the thred from day to day fast about them, vntill they drie away and fall off. With this are you also to note, that when there be many warts together, like as commonly hapneth, you must begin first at the greatest, for that they haue such a sympathie one with ano∣ther, that when the greatest (being as the mother) hath her nourishment taken away, thereby the rest may easily be killed. Item, burne them with a Rie straw, and take afterwards powned Saffron, séeth it in Sal∣lad oyle, and then put salt vnto it and Swines grease, to the end it may be as a salue, and then lay it vpon them. For this is also méete all that which is discouered in the fourth part the second Chapter and 3. §. for the Cornes. The warts require also a moderate diet, and that he forbeare all that might ingender melancholicke bloud. Of the Measels, red Gum, and of the small Pockes in generall. §. 3. CHildren are for the most part subiect vnto these diseases, and also auncient folks otherwhiles. And like as the same be perillous in yong children, so be they more perillous in ancient people. They do come also through many kinds of meanes, sometimes like red spots: also with waterish blisters which outward∣ly appeare cleane ouer ones bodie vpon the skin, as big as Millet seede, which at last drie away and fall off. These be also (to tell the troth) not without great danger, especially if they happen through cold not to breake out: or if they haue appeared al∣readie vpon the skinne on the outside, and be strucken in againe; for thereby do they make a narrownesse of the breast, a short breath, hoarsenesse, disease of the throate, or of the mouth, and anguish of the whole bodie, with great Agues. The learned haue sought out the causes of this breaking out of the small Pocks, Measels, and such like: therefore be they of opinion, that one bringeth the cause of this sicknes with him out of his mothers wombe when he is borne. For that because as the fruit is nourished of the finest bloud of his mothers Termes: so doth the vncleanesse of that bloud remaine in the pores of the children, and in other places mo, which nature afterwards driueth out in due time. And because that all humane creatures be through such meanes and nourishment sustained and fed in their mothers wombe, therfore doth it seldome happen, that any kind of people can be old, without getting these Pocks or Measels, wherof this cōmon false opinion is spread and
growne amongst many people, that all children must once haue these Pocks or Measels, wher∣by many mothers which haue many children, if any of them get the Pockes or Measels, let them runne one amongst another, whereby one child is infected of another, and so do catch the Pocks or Measels: saying besides the truth, that it is better that they get them in their child∣hood, than when they be growne in yeares. But this is none other (like as I haue said) but a false opinion, for one may be fréed of this sicknesse through a good diet. There be also other causes mo concerning these maladies, viz. stinking ayre, which doth heate the bloud and other humors of the bodie, and troubleth them. Like as to be long conuer∣sant in the warme Sunne: also to ouercharge him with such meate which quickly corrupteth in the stomacke, as fish and milke eaten together, through much bad bloud, through omitting an accustomed letting of bloud, and such like causes moe. The signes of these sicknesses be paine of the backe, itch of the eares and of the nose, which come of the vapours of the corrupt matter, and are partly pestilentiall: therefore they haue a frightfull sléepe, and the pricking may be felt ouer the whole bodie. With this they haue also a slothfulnesse in all parts, rednesse of the face and of the eyes, and somewhat swelling: and they be so long pinched with sléepinesse, vntill the Pockes do breake out vpon them euery where. And although (like as we haue admonished) the Measels and the Pocks haue one kind of cause, yet we will discourse of each apart, as much as is possible. Of the Measels. §. 4. THis is (as we haue said) a common infirmitie of children, and it also assayleth auncient and full growne people, so that they ouer the whole bodie (some lesse, othersome more) are besprinkled with red spots. There is also great heate of∣tentimes with it, and a pursiuenesse in the breast. In this sicknes must one be∣ware especially of cold, yea of open ayre, and of hot meate and drink. And aun∣cient persons are to order themselues, as we shall shew in discourse of the small Pocks. Common people do especially commend the Conserue of Eldern flowers, and the same rubbed vpon the heated parts. But what is further conuenient for this purpose, you may make choice thereof according to the importance of the cause, out of the description ensuing of the small Pockes, what shall like you best. Of the small Pockes. §. 5. WHen as Children be assayled with these foresaid Measels or Pockes, and they will not breake out, then take oyle of Cammomill and good Wine, of each one ounce and a halfe, Saltpeter one dragme, séeth it together vntill all the Wine be wasted, and annoint the whole bodie with it when it is very well warmed. This potion following is very good for all aged people, and also for all young children. Take Citron péels one quarter of an ounce, sower Dates one quarter of an ounce, Cicorie roots halfe an ounce, the flowers of Buglosse and of Burrage, of each halfe a handfull: séeth them to∣gether in a pint of water vntill about the third part be consumed: afterwards straine it, and temper amongst it Sir. Acetositatis Citri two ounces, de Corticibus Citri, de Succo Acetoso, of each one ounce: giue oftentimes a little of it, for it is very méete and pleasant. Item, take Oliue leaues two handfuls, Agrimonie one handfull: séeth it all together in good Wine, and drinke thereof euery morning thrée or foure spoonfuls: it drieth vp all affluent humors. But when these Pockes begin to fal away, then are these means following to be vsed, according to the importance of the cause: Take Ceruse halfe an ounce, oyle of Roses one ounce and a halfe, Camfere the quantitie of a Pease, Saltpeter halfe a drag. and two or thrée péeled Almonds, wherewith you are to chafe the Camfere. Afterwards temper one amongst the o∣ther, and therewith annoint the place of the Pockes: Or take Sallad oyle, and Ceruse as be∣fore: then temper them together with a little Vineger and Rosewater, and vse it as before. Some do also aduise to take strong lye, which is hereafter described against the burning of gunpowder.
Another sort of small Pockes, which be called Swine pockes. §. 6. LIke as we haue said before, these kind of Pockes be much like to the other before mentioned, and proceede also of the same cause, sauing onely that these wherof we now write, be bigger, broader, and also with greater anguish of the breast and of the breath: therefore may all be vsed for this, that is expressed for the tro∣bled breast in the second Part, the fift Chapter, and 9. §. aswell in old as in young people. But especially is this salue following to be ordained for it: Take fresh Butter, oyle of sweet Almonds, and Goose grease, of each halfe an ounce, Waxe as much as is néedfull. Some do put vnto it halfe an ounce of Turpentine, and one ounce of liquid Storax: this is especiall good, and also approued oftentimes. Aged people be much aduised to eate none other thing but Barley pap, or Oaten paps, and to drinke Barley water. Take fourtéene or fifteene Figs, Pistacies one quarter of an ounce, Fennell seede, the seedes of Smallage and Lacca, of each thrée dragmes, Lentils one ounce and a halfe, Dragagant halfe a dragme, Roses, Saunders, burnt Iuorie, and Quince kernels, of each halfe an ounce; séeth them all together in three quarts of Water, vntill a third part be wa∣sted, and then drinke a good draught thereof in the morning and euening. He is also to vse often∣times Oxysaechara, conserue of Roses, conserue of Rasps, the sirupe of Sorrell, of Veriuice, and of Quinces, to make the bloud thicke with it, and to coole it. There is especially commended for this, the water of Lentils when it is boyled in the third liquor, to wit, the two first being powred out. If now it be feared that the Pockes should hurt the eyes, then is this following to be vsed for it: Take Lycium, the iuice of Sloes, and Saffron, of each one dragme, Camfere one scruple; temper this all together in Rosewater, and drop it oftentimes into the eyes. If so be that now any Pocks or any rednes be perceiued on the apple of the eye, then vse Sief album, and that according to the qualitie of the cause: for which you may looke into the Register, where you shall find also the manner to make it. But if there do come any exulceration in the throate or mouth, then cleanse the same with Barley water, wherein sirupe of Mulberries, wine of Pomegranates, and such like be decocted, and drinke the same also softly. The iuice of Mints is also to be drawne vp through the nose, tempered with Saunders, Veriuice & Vineger: the same also fumed is good for it. Now when as the Pockes do anguish the Lights, then vse Dia∣papauer. If there be any hoarsnes or roughnes of the throate then looke what is good for it in the place where we discourse of it. For which is also this gargarisation to be made with Licorice, Iuiubes, Sebestes, and Figs decocted in water, and a litle Dragagant dissolued in it, and then to cleanse the mouth with it, and sometime to swallow downe some of it. When as there is no ague with it, then is it very good that one drinke warme Goates milke. Now for to free the in∣trailes from the Pockes, rosted Quinces are to be taken with Sugar, or the sirupe of the same. If a scowring happen with it, looke what is described in the third part, the eleuenth chapter, and 13. §. Lastly, all renowmed and famous Phisitions do aduise (against the opinion of the com∣mon people) that one should about the seuenth day open the Pockes, if they be ripe, with a gol∣den néedle, for to let out the matter, to the end that through their sharpnesse they should not eate inward, and leaue great Cicatrises behind them. Make also a powder with Salt, Len∣tils meale, Beane meale, Pease meale, litharge of gold, and Ceruse: strew the parts with it, to the end that thereby the matter may drie. All which cannot be hurtfull. If so be that after healing of the Pockes there do remaine great dents, pits, or scars, then may these things ensuing be vsed. Take Sarcocolla, Melon seede, washed Rice, whites of Egs, Chalke, Bolus, or white Su∣gar: temper them with the oyle of Roses, or the oyle of Lillies, and therewith annoint the Ci∣catrises. Or in stéede of the oyle, take Hens grease. Item, take the Caule of a young Goate or Kid, powre Goates milke vpon it, then set it so in the Sun, and powre fresh milke euery day vpon it the space of one wéeke: afterwards lay it the space of foure daies in Rosewater, and then hang it vp to drie. This being done shread it small, and put it into a siluer beaker, and set it in boiling water: when it is molten, then straine it thorough a cloth, and annoint therewith the markes and small Pockes.
Of clefts in the Skin. §. 7. YOu haue in the first Part, the ninth Chapter, and 1. §. of the clifts in the lips. Item, in the third part, the fift Chapter, and 2. §. in the description of the places in women. And in the tenth Chapter, and 11. §. of the clifts in the Arsegut. Also in the fourth part, the first Chapter, and 7. §. of the clifts in the hands: all which remedies there described may be vsed for this our intent, and also all these that follow. Take the gréene rind of the Elder, stéepe it in a sufficient quantitie of Sallad oyle, boyle them together, wring them out hard, and with Waxe make a salue of them. This salue is also very good to be vsed against the burning fire. Item, take oyle of Roses, white Waxe, Frankinsence, Masticke, and Hens grease, of each halfe an ounce, Ginger halfe a dragme; melt the Waxe, the oyle, and the grease together, and temper the rest amongst it. Of the itch in the skin. §. 8. BEfore we begin to write of the Scabs, we will first intreate of the drie itch of the skin. This is called in Latine Pruritus, which is a desire to rub and scratch, either the whole bodie or some part of it, by reason of the great itch, which is caused of some sharpe humors, which do yet lie vnder the skinne. Also, if the humors (which are stirred vp either by heate or by labour) be so tough, that they cannot transpirate through the skin and ye pores of the same, then do they cause an itch. Also Lice, Fleas, Ants, and Woodlice, do cause an itch. Item, if one do but seldome change his apparell. The inward causes may be an ouer great heate of the liuer, which doth ingender sharpe and adust humors: also, debilitie of the vertue expulsiue, as doth appeare in aged folkes. The signs of this itch are manifest, as that a bodie cannot sléepe for it, and is hindered from doing his bu∣sinesse aright. Now to come to the remedies of the itch, the patient shall haue a veine opened, be purged, and almost obserue the same order which hereafter is prescribed against scabbednesse. A swea∣ting bath and water baths are specially commended for this purpose, which being once vsed, and not turning away the itch, shew that the humors in quantitie do abound, which cause the same. This bathing is to be reiterated, and the bodie to be rubbed where it itcheth most with this receipt following: Take white Roses two ounces, beate them thoroughly with Vineger, and adde one ounce of Bran vnto them. The next day following bath againe, and rub your bodie with powned Smallage, with gréene Nutshels, or with Fenegréeke. These itchie pati∣ents are to forbeare all manner of Salt and hote things, and especially all that might inflame or burne the bloud. If this itch be about the yard or member of a man, then take a quarter of an ounce of Ceruse Sulphur vife one dragme and a halfe, Opium halfe a dragme; make a salue of it with Vineger: some do adde two scruples of beaten Licebane vnto it. If this itch be in the Arsegut, or in the wombe, then take burnt Allume one quarter of an ounce, Argall one ounce, temper them with vineger, spread it on a cloth and so apply it. Of Scabbednesse. §. 9. SCabbednes is of diuers kinds, some with scales, some with blisters, some with matter, and some without matter, some dry and red; but all of them with an intolerable itch, according to the nature of the humors which cause the same, and are mixed with the bloud. The cause of this infirmitie, are the vses of all kind of hot, sharpe, salt, and bitter meates, as spices, strong wine, oyle, hony, want of change in apparell to lye or deale with them that be scabbed, with many other inward causes, that procéed of an in∣flamed and corrupted bloud.
The signes of all manner of scabbednes are apparant: but of what kind of humor the same is caused, shall appeare by these reasons following. If it be caused of bloud, that may be known by the repletion of the bodie, rednes of the parts, and if the bloud or matter do issue forth in the scratching: The patient hath also commonly a swéet tast in the mouth. But if this scabbednes be caused of a salt phlegme, then is the skin yellowish, scaly, and reasonably full of matter: the patient cannot be quiet for the itch, and after scratching findeth great paine and smarting. If it procéed of Cholera, then perceiueth he not onely a great drought in the ioynts, but also in the scabs themselues, with pricking, burning, and small store of moisture: or if it be caused of Me∣lancholy, then is the skinne blackish, drie, with many scales, and without matter. Now for to cure this common and well knowne griefe, are these rules following to be ob∣serued diligently. First, because the common cause of this disease is grosse and foule bloud, first of all a veine ought to be opened. Secondly, after the letting of bloud, is the bodie to be pur∣ged, and especially with Mirobalans, and Fumitorie. Thirdly, because the itch and scab∣bednes are ingendred of salt, sharpe, swéet, and spiced meates, are the same wholy to be for∣borne. Fourthly, venery is to be shunned, because thereby the humor is drawne to the outside of the bodie, where it doth raise hote and stinking vapors, that disperse themselues vnder the skinne. Fiftly, bathing, inunction, and whatsoeuer else may be vsed outwardly, doth smal ease, vnlesse the bodie be first throughly purged. Sixtly, in eating and drinking refraine all salt, sharp, swéet, and hote things. Seuenthly, sowre and moist meates that do not suddenly putri∣fie in the stomacke, are good for him. Eightly, because Peaches and some other herbes, also fish, milke, and such like do corrupt the bloud, they are to be shunned. Ninthly, the patient must for∣beare scratching as much as is possible, for thereby little pushes are turned into great scabs. Tenthly, the moister that the scabbednes is, the stronger remedies doth it require. As concerning the cure of this infirmitie, the opening of the Median or Lyuer veine is not to be omitted, and that as long as the patient can indure it. Then is the humor to be prepared with Oxysacchara, sirupe of Fumitorie, and Pease broth: afterwards to purge with Cassy, with sowre Dates, with Mirobalans, with Dodoer, or with Rubarb infused or sodden in whay of milke, but aboue all other things is Fumitorie commended, whether it be the iuice, the sirupe, the conserue, or decoctiue potions, or whatsoeuer else may be made of it. Sene leaues do the same, whereof thou maist vse those two kinds of potions in this scab∣bednes, which are described in the third Part and 20. §. Item, take powned Sene leaues one drag. strew them vpon stewed Currans, and so eate them daily: vse them so long, till thou be loose in bodie, and as thy stomacke will suffer thee. Some do commend the golden water which is described in the last Part, if a little of it be taken either inwardly, or annointed on the scabbednesse outwardly. After that the bodie hath bene throughly purged, it is a cōmon order to bath, otherwhiles in faire water, otherwhiles also in naturall drie baths, each as you like it best. But those that cannot intend to trauaile to the dry bathes, may take Salt, Allume, Brimstone, Argall and such like, according as the scabbednes doth require, and so with water make a bath of them. There are also many kinds of salues and oyles ordained for it, whereof diuers shall be spe∣cified at this present: Take litharge of Siluer finely powdered two ounces, Vineger foure oun∣ces, boyle them together vntill one third part be wasted, then adde two ounces of oyle of O∣liues vnto it, one ounce of Ceruse, then boyle them together vntill they be thicke, stirring them continually. Another: Take Ceruse two ounces, litharge of Siluer one ounce, Masticke, and Frankin∣sence, of each two dragmes; beate them all together to fine powder, and mixe them with three ounces of the oyle of Oliues, and in the tempering of them powre now and then foure or fiue drops of Rosewater and Vineger vnto them. In like manner you haue also in the fourth Part, the ninth Chapter and 1. §. fiue kinds of white salues, which one may also vse with all securitie for scabbednesse. Item, in the first Part, the third Chapter, and 10. §. there is a good salue beginning thus: Take Turpentine, &c. Item, take Bayberries, Vineger, & oyle of Oliues as much as you please, and temper them all together to a salue, it is very good and safe. Take the rootes of Bistorta one dragme, prepared Sarcocolla two dragmes and a halfe, Sandaraca foure scruples, prepared Tutia one scruple, Tur∣pentine
washt with water of Fumitorie foure ounces, Camfer halfe a scruple; temper amongst it sixe ounces of the next following salue of Elecampane rootes. Take the iuice of Elecampane rootes, and of Dock rootes, of each thrée ounces, Saltpeter, Sarcocolla, the lytharge of Siluer, and Masticke, of each fifteene graines, Coperas and Allume, (called lamemum) of each two scruples, mortified Quicksiluer one dragme, Butter two drag. and a halfe, Turpentine one ounce and a halfe, Pitch one ounce: the Butter, Pitch, and Tur∣pentine must you melt together, and afterwards temper the other ingredients amongst it, and let it seeth with a soft fire vntill all the iuices be consumed: you are then to annoint the patient therewith by a good fire, and that especially on the places where the most scabbednesse is; this salue draweth the corruption outward. Another: take washt Turpentine two ounces, washt Butter one ounce, Salt halfe an ounce, the iuice of three Limons, two yolkes of Egs brayed, oyle of Roses halfe an ounce, or as much as is néedfull for to make a thin salue: then temper it all together, it is a safe salue. In the fourth Part, the seuenth Chapter, and 3. §. you haue also a good salue, beginning thus: Take Sage, Mallowes, &c. which one may vse very safely for all manner of scabs. Or take Dock rootes, powne them very small, temper vineger amongst it, and salt it well: with this are you to rub your selfe well in the bath when you will go out of it, without wetting your selfe after it. Item, take Dock rootes, and Hollihocke rootes, of each two ounces and a halfe, Hellebore rootes one ounce, Smallage halfe a handfull; séeth them all together in fresh well water vntill the third part be wasted: straine it, and put into this decoction one ounce and a halfe of Salt, Saltpeter one quarter of an ounce; fresh Butter, and oyle of Roses, of each two ounces: let it séeth the second time vntill all the moisture be consumed, afterwards temper amongst it washt Turpentine one ounce, Treacle three dragmes, the iuice of Limons or of Oranges two ounces, lastly, temper them all together. Item, take the iuice of Mints, liquid Storax, of each one ounce and a halfe, Salt thrée oun∣ces, oyle of Roses two ounces and a halfe, and make a salue thereof. The plaister Diachilon may also be well melted in oyle of Roses, for the same vse: Sulphur vife tempered with Turpentine, is also much commended for this. Or make it thus: Take Sul∣phur vife halfe an ounce, Salt as much also stampt small together, Sallad oyle two ounces, then make it to a salue with Waxe, as thicke as you desire. Take Ashes, Salt, and Sulphur, of each one ounce, bind them all together in a fine cloth, and then seeth it in foure ounces of Sal∣lad oyle, and rub the scabbednes therewith. Another. Take Turpentine, which is washt well with Rose water two ounces, oyle of Ro∣ses, oyle of Costus, and fresh Butter, of each halfe an ounce, Sulphur vife thrée dragms, Salt∣peter one quarter of an ounce, and two yolkes of Egs, then temper it vpon warme ashes. Item, take washt Turpentine sixe ounces, quicke Lime two ounces, Soote of the chimney one quar∣ter of an ounce, and temper them all together. This salue following is much stronger than the forementioned: take of the salue of Elecam∣pane rootes, not long since described, nine ounces, Myrrhe, Swines bread, Hartwort, powned all together very small, of each one quarter of an ounce, Beane meale two ounces, Sene pow∣der one quarter of an ounce, Sal gemmae two scrup. temper them all together vnto a salue. Some do take fresh Butter and Swines bread, of each foure ounces, Ceruse thrée dragmes, Quicksiluer one dragme, stir them so long together that you sée the Quicksiluer no more, and therewith annoint the place infected once a day. Other do make it thus: They do take powned Bayberries, and fresh May butter, of each foure ounces, and melt it by the fire: when it is a little cold, then mixe one dragme of Quick∣siluer amongst it, and afterwards the Bayberries, iuice of Nightshade, and iuice of Mallowes, of each three quarters of an ounce: if one cannot get the iuices, then take the powned herbes, and if so be that the salue be not tough enough, then put a little Turpentine vnto it. Item, take mans grease, Rose water, and Quicksiluer, each according to his waight, like as it is said before in this last salue, and annoint therewith the scabbed place once a day. Another: Take a small Cruise full of raine water, and put therein one dragme of Mercury sublimati, so let it séeth together in a glasse with a narrow necke by a soft fire: and when it is cold, then temper therewith the iuice of Limons, and Rosewater, of each halfe an ounce, and
vse it as before. Some do take Aqua vitae, and therein do they séeth a little Quicksiluer, and therewith annoint the scabs. Item, take Swines grease two ounces and a halfe, oyle of Bayberries one ounce, mortified Quicksiluer, Frankinsence and Masticke, of each one dragme, Salt two ounces, the iuice of Plantaine and of Fumitorie, of each one ounce and a halfe: lastly, temper one scruple of Orpi∣ment with it. Or take Barrowes grease twelue ounces, Quicksiluer mortified with vineger half an ounce, oyle of Roses one ounce, Frankinsence, Mastick, Myrrhe, Sarcocolla, and litharge of Siluer, of each halfe a dragme, Turpentine thrée ounces which is washed well in the iuice of Fumitorie, Waxe halfe an ounce, the two last are to be molten together, and temper the Bar∣rowes grease amongst it, and at last the other powders: then stirre all well together vntil it be cold. With this salue is the patient to annoint himselfe twice a day the space of fiue daies, and the other sixe or eight daies afterwards, then is he to wash him with this water following: Take Docke rootes and Elecampane rootes both cut, of each sixe ounces, Bran sixe handfuls, Mallowes, Violet leaues, and Fumitorie, of each twelue ounces, séeth all together in sufficient water, that one may bath therein, sit in it méetly warme, and comming out of the bath, lay your selfe about the space of an hower in bed. But here is to be noted, that the salues which be tempered with Quicksiluer, are more méet for the pockes then for scabs, as hereafter shall be shewed in more ample manner. If any bodie be plagued with a troublesome scabbednes, which proceedeth from a salt melan∣cholicke matter: then take the iuice of Elecampane rootes, and of Docke rootes, of each halfe an ounce, liquid Storax, blacke Hellebore, and prepared Tuttie, of each two scruples; temper these all together in a leaden mortar, foure or fiue howers together vnto a salue. It happeneth also otherwhiles, that by some disease of the stomacke or of the liuer, this dis∣ease doth grow, and doth so spread it selfe ouer the whole bodie, that one supposeth certainely that it is a right leprosie. For this do all expert Phisitions know good aduice, with letting of bloud and purging at ye first. And for this kind of scabs is this remedie following found, wher∣in I my selfe haue found maruellous operations: take oyle of bitter Almonds sixtéene ounces, fiftie common Creuets, powne them, and let them séeth in the oyle: afterwards wring them hard through a cloth, and temper amongst it eight ounces of the oyle of Egs, and annoint you therewith twice a day. For this is also good Sallad oyle, wherein Frogs be decocted. Item, take a water Snake, cut off the head and the taile and cast it away, afterwards cut the rest in small péeces, and seeth them in oyle and straine it. In like manner you haue also in the fourth Part, the first Chapter, and 8. §. against the scab∣bed hands a salue, beginning thus: Take Docke rootes, &c. which is very méete for this kind of scab, and excéedeth also all others. The oyle of Elderne flowers doth cleanse, and mollifieth and taketh all scabbednes away from the hands. The oyle of Egges is very commodious of it selfe for all sharpe scabs, likewise also the oyle of Tiles. Iuniper oyle, whether it be drawne out of the wood, or out of the séede, doth expell all infection of the skin, although it were a Canker, or any old vlcer. Also, oyle distilled out of Wheate is much commended for the same. We haue also in the fourth Part, the first Chapter, and 6. §. other remedies moe against the scabbednesse and the sorenesse, which may be vsed for this, and ouer the whole body. Also, the maiden milke is very good for this, which is described in the first Part, the 5. Chapter, and 1. §. Of Tumors. §. 10. BEcause we haue sufficiently before discoursed of scabbednes, therefore we will now speake and discourse of certaine swellings, which assaile the skin and the flesh vnder it. And because there can be no impostumes without swelling or rankling, as also all swelling may be caused of blowes, fals, wounds, fractures of bones, and such like: therfore it is néedlesse to spend any longer time therin, euery one may himselfe séeke in the Register for the member, wherein euery such swelling doth manifest it selfe, where may be found perfect direction for all: wherefore we will onely here declare certaine common rules. First, is a Nutmeg very good for to cleanse all corruption of the bloud, and that especially for the swelling of the milt: Conserue of Eldern berries doth also cure all inward swelling. In like
manner doth Conserue of the same flowers expell all scourings of the belly. Foure or fiue Figs eaten twice a day are also very méete in all swellings. Amongst oyles which may be annoin∣ted on the outside, are these following: to wit, oyle of Mints, of Dill, or Lillies, and Tiles. And amongst all salues, the salue Althaea. There is a kind of swelling, which is soft, without paine, and which spreadeth it selfe farre abroad, which the Grecians do call Oedema, which ingendreth of wind and cold humors: with this manner of swelling are commonly hydropicall patients troubled, and those that haue the Consumption, or any other long lingering disease. This swelling is also in the foresaid sick∣nes no cause of the same, but onely an accident; so that the same hath no néede of any speciall remedie, but onely to apply vnto it Oxyrhodinum, tempered with salt, or salted Sallad oyle. Of all Botches, Byles, and other hard swellings. §. 11. NOw if there appeare any hard swellings, Botches, Byles, or Wennes in any place of the bodie, & that at last there befall with it heate, or rednes with paine, without inclining neuertheles to impostumation; then do the Grecians cal the same Phegmonas: But this name comprehendeth many kinds of swellings, for that by the name Phlegmone be vnderstood all the swellings of the groines, the Bubones and such like moe, because that the same be caused of one kind of cause, viz. of bloud and Cholera. These swellings may also be caused of fals, of blowes, or of thrusts, through which the humors be drawne towards the bruised place, and there being gathered to∣gether, do make such tumors, impostumations, and other swellings. Besides that it hapneth so much the sooner, if a body be plethoricke and full of bloud. The signes of these foresaid swellings, are heate, rednesse, paine, and beating, which is felt déepe in the flesh, the whole member where this impostume is, thereby appeareth distempe∣red with heate and inflammation, with great swellings, and desire of cooling things. And when as the member is more sinewie wherein this impostume commeth, so much grea∣ter is the paine: and how much more fleshly it is, so much is the paine and the pricking the lesse, and commeth easier to a perfect impostumation. Now for to remedie these kinds of swellings, must we note certaine rules. First, if the patient be plethoricke, then is one of his veines to be opened, and that alwaies in the side where the swelling is not, and according to the situation of the place where the swel∣ling appeareth. Secondly, if the matter be hote, then must one giue the patient those medicins which allay the heate. Thirdly, when the matter is well purged, then are repulsiue remedies to be vsed vpon the swelling, if it be not that the swelling stand in such a place, wherby nature is wont to expell all superfluitie from her. Fourthly, amongst the things which hinder repulsion be grosse and tough humors, cold and abundance of the matter. Fiftly, if so be that a swelling be great, and it séeme to be inclined to impostumation, then are no repulsiue things to be vsed, but only maturatiues. Sixtly, when it is certaine that the impostume is ripe, and full of cor∣ruption, then is the same to be immediatly opened, and especially if it stand neare some noble part; for that if one delayed the opening too long, then might the matter eate inward, and do more hurt. Seuenthly, the healing of this hot impostume, consisteth onely in staying of the af∣fluent humors, and in discussing the matter present. Now for to heale this impostume, one must imitate the first rule, and in the beginning open the vein on the contrarie side. But if so be that the tumor haue alreadie continued three or foure daies, and the same were very big, then is the veine to be opened on the same side where the swelling is. The patient is also to be purged with sowre Dates, with Cassie, with sirupe of Roses, with the Confection of the iuice of Roses, or such like, and lay vpon it repulsiue medi∣caments for to lessen the power of the swelling, as cold herbes, Purslaine, Gourds, Endiue, and Nightshade powned, and their iuices. When as now the cause is come to the state, and to the highest, then are maturatiues to be vsed, whereof here be diuers discouered. Some pocke Phisitions do aduise, that do not know better, or they that gladly hold the matter long in their hands, that the swelling is the space of thirty daies together to be fomen∣ted with Marchasita, but that is very néedlesse.
This confection following is of the same quality, and therfore to be also omitted: Take Scro∣phularia, Polypody rootes, Betony and swines bread, of each one dragme, poune them small to∣gither, and being tempered with three ounces of Sugar, make a confection thereof. For to ap∣ply vnto it might this aforesaid be borne withall in some sort, for that it mollifieth all hard swellings, like as many other plaisters do. Take the muscilage of Hollihocke rootes, of Fenegréeke, and of Linséed, of each one ounce and a halfe, Barley meale two ounces, oyle of Lillies and Hens grease, of each one ounce, But∣ter halfe an ounce, Saffron halfe a scruple, and one yolke of an egge: séeth the muscilage with meale by a milde fier, and at last stir the yolke of the egge amongst it. This plaister mollifieth all swellings which be mixed with cold and heat: it swageth also the paine in all the sinewy parts, and such like things moe. Will you now vse it for all cold swellings? then temper amongst it Ammoniacum, Bdellium, and liquid Storax, of each halfe an ounce, wherwith it is very commo∣dious to mollifie and ripen all hard swellings. Another. Take Cammomill one handfull, séeth it in good wine euen to the halfe, then tem∣per amongst it Sallad oyle & Butter, of each one ounce and a halfe, and as much Barly meale, vntill it be a pap; then lay it vpon the tumour, it ripeneth and mollifieth all hardnes. Item, take Cammomill, Melilot, Roses, Dill séed, Fenegreeke, Hollyhock séed, and Lin∣seed, of each one handfull, oyle of Lillies, and vnsalted butter, of each two ounces, Saffron one scruple, temper them together by a soft fire vnto a plaister, it mollifieth all hardnes, and easeth the paine. Another. Take Cammomill, Melilot, Mallowes, and Hollyhock floures, of each one hand∣full, Barly meale one ounce, oyle of Lillies and of Cammomill, of each one ounce and a halfe: seeth the floures in sufficient water vnto the halfe, wring it out well, and poune it: put then the oile and meale vnto it; this plaister hath the same operation with the other. Yet one mo, which is very good: Take Hens grease, Goose grease, and marrow of Neats féete, of each one ounce, Muscilage of Hollyhock rootes, of Fenegréeke, and of Linseed, of each one ounce, Bdellium, Galbanum, and Ammoniacum, of each one ounce and a halfe: dissolue the gums in two ounces of oyle of Lillies, and then melt them with the grease and slime. Then poune 24. or 25. fat Figs amongst it, and stirre them all together, and lay thereof vpon the swelling. For to annoynt, is this following to be prepared: Take Beane meale, Allume, Polypody rootes, Swines bred, wild Cucumbers, Hartwort, Scrophularia, of each alike quantitie beaten, Sallad oyle as much as is néedfull for to make a salue thereof. This is a very strong salue. Take well decocted Rosemary rootes, and temper them with Hony: Item, take oyle of Ro∣ses one ounce and a halfe, washed Turpentine two ounces, Mirrha halfe an ounce, the yolks of two egs, Barly meale as much as is néedfull for to make a soft plaister with it. This plaister causeth all swellings to ripen: Take Violets & water Lillies, of each one ounce, oyle of Quin∣ces halfe an ounce, Starch two ounces, Camfer one scruple, fine Bolus one dragme: make a salue thereof for to vse for all hot swellings. Item, take Pitch, Turpentine, and Rosin, of each one ounce and a halfe, Waxe one ounce, Sallad oyle thrée quarters of an ounce, let them melt together by a milde fire. The plaister Diachilon doth also much mollifie all hard swellings. In the second part the second Chapter and 7. §. you haue many excellent things which also may be vsed for this purpose. But if so be that these hard kind of swellings and impostumes be ripe, which is thereby easily to be knowne, when the heate, the ague, and other accidents do diminish; also, when the hard∣nes is mollified, then must the swelling be opened, and so kept with taints, and to cleanse it well, so that for certaine dayes together all the matter and corruption may runne out: lay also clouts on euery time with red or any other amper wine, wherein Roses and Cammomill haue béene decocted. If so be that now after the healing like as it hapneth sometimes in these kinds of hot swel∣lings, there remaine some paine which kéepeth the patient disquiet, then lay beaten yolks of egs vpon it, tempered with oyle of Roses. Or take crums of white bread, and powre séething water vpon it, then wring it out againe and temper them with oyle of Roses vnto a pap. Item, séeth Mallowes in common water, stamp them, and temper them with Bran and
oyle of Violets: to all these forementioned things are you to temper alwayes some Saffron, because that it hath an especiall power in alaying of all paines. Of the Rose, a certaine impediment, called Erysipelas. §. 12. AMongst the hot swellings whereof commonly the foresaid impostumes are caused, is also the Rose or Erysipelas, which is none other thing but an inflam∣mation of the skin, which in this countrie we call the Rose. The Latinists do call it Ignem sacrum, which is the holy fire, for that when the Rose appeareth in any place of the bodie, then doth it come with a burning heate, with an ague, and with a dry rednes. And to know this impediment from all other inflammations, lay your finger vpon the chiefest place of the rednes, wring it so easily, if so be that then the place whence you lift vp your finger that you had so wrung do séeme white, and in the twinkling of an eye séeme red againe, then is it a sure signe of the Rose. This swelling commonly assaileth one with a quiuering, with heate, and cold, it infecteth also only the skin without piercing (as other swellings) into the flesh, or very seldome, and when this in∣flammation of the Rose goeth inward into the bodie, then is it a very bad signe. Now for to heale this infection of the Rose, must héed be taken to these orders following. First, can not one do better, then to purge this hot cholerick matter (whence this swelling hath his foundation) with necessarie medicines: secondly, these cholerick humors (which be as it were a skumme of the bloud) be not only a cause of this Rose, by their abundance, but also by their heate and inflammation: wherefore it is not hurtfull for to open a vaine, thereby to coole the bloud. Thirdly, the cooling of this inflammation may not be vsed in all places by laying on of some repulsiue things, to the end that the hot matter be not repelled and driuen to any noble part, as to the braines, the hart, &c. whereby some great mischance might ensue. Fourthly, no cold things are to be vsed for this swelling, if the bodie before be not well pur∣ged. Fiftly, it is not néedfull for to ripen these swellings, but only to coole them. Sixtly, if this Rose be without any mixture of other swellings, then doth it not hurt although one drinke cold water, but it is rather a medicine in this disease. Seuenthly, when the swelling is caused of a red Cholera, then is it so much the hotter, therefore strong cooling things are to be vsed. Eightly, if so be that this swelling be tempered with an other sort of swelling, then is the same so long to be cooled, vntill one perceiue that the member hath gotten againe his naturall colour. Ninthly, if the place of the swelling begin to seeme black and browne, then vse no cooling things moe, to the end that thereby it come not to impostumate and ranckle. And to preuent these things, this is to be done: first of all purge the patient, for to expell the Cholera with Cassy, Electuario Lenitiuo, Diaphoenicone, De succo Rosarum, De Sebeste, as is shewed at large in the third part, the twelfth Chapter, and 6. §. But it were not amisse alwayes to adde some Rubarb vnto either of these medicines. But aboue all, he must beware of the vse of Scammony, or Diagridion. But take 24. or 25. Prunes, sowre Dates one ounce and a quarter, séeth them well in sufficient well water, then take of this decoction thrée ounces, and stéepe therein one dragme of Rubarb throughout the whole night, afterwards wring it out in the morning, and mingle one ounce of the sirupe of Violets with it, or as much as you thinke good, and so drinke it warme. If this purgation be too weake, then take some of the forenamed, and especially De succo Rosarum, and temper there∣with one quarter of an ounce. It hapneth also oftentimes, that through the taking of any me∣dicine, paine and maruellous accidents are perceiued, then is the patient presently to take warme water, or this ensuing. Take Annis, and Fennell, of each halfe a dragme, Roses, Violets, floures of Burrage and of Buglosse, of each halfe a handfull, Saffron three greines, séeth it together with water, and drinke a good draught thereof, or lay it vpon the stomack. Afterwards set a boxing cup (vnpickt) vpon the hart, and two behinde vpon the back, and if so be that the age, and the repletion of the bodie may suffer it, then is the lyuer vaine to be opened: otherwise may it be omitted, for that in this disease letting of bloud is not alwayes necessarie. His whole order of dyet must be cooling things, wherefore wine is much forbidden, and
in the stéede thereof, is there nothing more requisite than Barly water. There may also be vsed sometimes the sirupe of Endiue, of Vineger, of Sorrell, and of Poppy heads: or the sirupe and Iulep of Roses, and of Violets is also much commended, and if so be that the long vse of Barly water went against him, then may he drinke Well water; as herebefore you haue seene fur∣ther direction in a hot stomacke and liuer. For to vse outwardly: Take Lettice, which is somewhat grosly beaten, and lay it vpon the heate of the swelling: or in the stéed thereof, take Lettice water. In like manner may you also vse this following, whether it be tempered, or each alone, being made wet with a spoonge, and so laid vpon it, viz. water of Endiue, of Corne roses, of water Lillies, of Violets, or the decoction of Roses. Item, lay Creame of milke vpon it, tempered with Bran, or crummes of white bread stéeped in milke; and in like manner also Oxyrrhodinum. Or take the iuice of Plantaine, and iuice of Housleeke, of each a like quantitie, and temper some Vineger with it. Some doe vse for it the right writing inke. Take Plantaine one handfull, Nightshade and Violets, of each halfe a handfull, Lineséed and Fenegréeke meale, of each halfe an ounce; let it séeth togi∣ther to growte: Afterwards temper the yolke of an Egge amongst it, and vse it as the other. Another: Take Barley meale two ounces, Linséed meale and Roses of each one ounce and a halfe, red and white Saunders of each one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus, and Camfere, of each one dragme, the iuice of Nightshade and of Housléeke, of each two ounces, and a little Vineger; temper them all togither with the oyle of Roses vnto a soft plaister. This oyle following is also very good for to asswage heate, viz. oyle of Roses, of water Lil∣lies, of Violets, and of Poppy heads. Neuertheles, there is here to be noted, that all oylie and fat things be not very méete for this; so that they are not to be vsed for this disease, but only for to mixe them with other things. For to annoint withall, take small powned litharge of gold, temper it vnto dough with oile of Roses, afterwards put a little sharp vineger vnto it, and stir it so long togither vntill that the Vineger be well tempered amongst it: this is chiefly to be annointed vpon the Rose there where there be any blisters apparant, thrée times a day. The salue of Roses, and the cooling salue Galeni, be very good for this, especially if there be a little Camfere tempered with both these. Also this salue following may sometimes be annointed vpon it: Take the oyle of Roses, of Cammomill, of Egges, and iuice of Plantaine, of each a like quantity, temper them all to∣gither. Or take this following: Take the iuice of Plantaine fower ounces, Rose water, and oyle of Roses, of each one ounce and a halfe. If you desire to make a salue thereof, then let it séeth vn∣till all the iuice be wasted, and then put some waxe vnto it: Otherwise may you dip a cloth therein and lay it thereon, and as then, the last described pap ouer it, beginning, Take Plan∣taine a handfull, &c. Item, take Barly meale, Hony, and the iuice of Apples, of each a like quantity, let them séeth togither vnto grout, and vse them as the other. You may also vse fomenting, where Ro∣ses, Cammomill, and Housléeke be decocted. Of the swellings of the Groynes, Armepits, and Eares. §. 13. WE haue here before in the common description of the Impostume and swelling admonished, that there is also comprehended by the same name, the swelling of the groines Bubones, as also the Carbuncles or plague sores. But because these swellings do commonly appeare in man and woman in the armeholes, or in the groynes: therefore haue we in the third part, the second chapter, and first §. written thereof at large. And it is also so with all other anguishes, Byles, Frunculis, but that they be somewhat more tolerable.
Of the Carbuncle or plague-sore, a perillous swelling. §. 14. THis Impostume doe the Gréekes call Anthracem, which is a Cole; the Latinists call it Carbonem and Carbunculum, which name we haue retained in our spéech, howbeit that some make a difference betwéene Anthrax and Carbunculus. This impostume is described as followeth. Anthrax is an hot impostume, by which the place where it appeareth is inflamed, burneth the grosse blood, and causeth a black cole or core with an intolerable paine. And there is also in trueth no woorse impostume amongst all the rest than this Anthrax, as all well learned Phisitions do write thereof, and as daylie experience bringeth with it. The signes whereby these two impostumes be knowen, is first a rednes of the member, with a small blackish, darke blew, or pale push, whereon a scale groweth, vnder the which there is some matter or corruption gathered. But by reason these hot Carbuncles, or plague sores, for the most part, and most perillously make shew in the time of plague (where shall be written at large of this matter) therefore will we not deuide the matter: but all those that are taken with them at other times, we do remit to the sixt part of this booke, prouiding there to teach at length whatsoeuer shall séeme néedfull for it; therefore we will be the briefer at this present. First must they which be infected with this disease, cause a veine to be opened, and that on the contrary side, if so be that he be full of blood, and of humors: afterwards vpon the same side: and if that can not be compassed, at leastwise there to set boxing cups; afterwards the pati∣ent is to be purged with the whay of milke, with Epithymo, with Agaricus, or with sower Dates. For to comfort him withall may he vse Citrons, Limons, and Orenges. In eating and drinking is he to kéepe himselfe, as one that is full of the ague, and according as the heate is great. Outwardly is he not to vse cold things, as in the Rose, for that the matter is somewhat thicker: But one may make a plaister of Gals, Plantaine, Lentils, of crusts of bread, or Bran, tempered with Vineger, Allume molten in Vineger, and then laid with clothes vpon it: for this are also good Pomegranates cut in péeces, and decocted mellow in Vineger, and laid vpon it as a plaister: for thereby will the heate and the paine be swaged. Now for to cause this paine to ripen, make a plaister of Figs, of Currans, of Nuts, of Barley meale, decocted with Wine and oyle. Round about the Carbuncle lay the salue of fine Bolus, made of Vineger and Rose water, for to defend the parts adiacent from heate. When as now this anguish is broken vp, then is it to be healed and cleansed with the mun∣dificatiue which is described in the second part, the second chapter, and 9. §. and to vse drying things so long, vntill that they be thorowly healed, which may be effected with the salue Basili∣con,Salue Basili∣cum. which is thus made: Take Ceruse fiue dragmes, Litharge of gold one quarter of an ounce, the Litharge of siluer one dragme and a halfe, Dragagant one dragme; make a powder there∣of, and temper it with an ounce of white Waxe, and thrée ounces of oyle of Roses, vnto a salue. Of all manner of old Vlcers and old Sores. §. 15. THese vlcers or old Sores, whether they be caused of Impostumes, windes, or any o∣ther occasions, be alwaies called by the Latinists Solutionem Continuitatis, which is a separation of continuity, which alwaies hapneth in all vlcers and sores, where the skin and the flesh parteth a sunder: whereof there be found many kinds, as we also haue described many of them before, and shall doe hereafter againe. But this present §. shall tell only of all old vlcers in generall: for which some of these rules following are to be obserued. First, if one sée that an vlcer or wound doe yéeld much thin matter, then is it a signe that one is to vse drying things. Secondly, if so be that the matter be tough and thicke, the are Abstersiua, which are mundifying things, to be vsed. Thirdly when these kinds of vl∣cers be dressed, then is héed to be taken that the vlcer be not blowen vpon with the South
winde, that there come also no cold, nor moysture into it, and that especially when the vlcer is moyst and hote. Fourthly, for all wounds drie things be good, and that the rather if the same be déepe. Fiftly, because there can be no good flesh engendred, vnlesse that the wound be first well dryed and clensed, therefore such things must be vsed for it at times, otherwise would the matter be augmented in the wounds, and be vnpossible for to engender flesh. Sixtly, there will be no flesh at all engendred, if it be not that the salue be like to the nature of the vlcer: therefore in all dry parts of the body dry things are to be vsed, and in moist parts, moist reme∣dies to be applied. Seuenthly, it must be looked too, that there be vsed no oiles in any vlcer, for that they bring a putrifaction in all déepe wounds and vlcers, and especially in warme time of yeare whether it be in dry or moist complexions. Eightly, it is néedfull, that in all qualities of the members which be hurt with any wound, or vlcer, where flesh must be engendred, the blood must be well cleansed, because that is the substance out of which the flesh must grow: and this not only in the same member, but also ouer the whole body. Ninthly, the drying medicines shall be no higher than drie in the first degrée, for that when the same drie too fast, then will the yoong flesh be consumed and dryed away. Tenthly, all drying medicines be very meete for all dry complexions: like as to the contrary, all moist medicines, be most necessary for all moist natures: whence it then followeth, that drie bodies or dry parties will be cured with drie me∣dicines, and moist with moist. Eleuenthly, if the wounds or sores be moist by nature, then be drie remedies to be vsed for it. Twelfthly, if there be two kinds of vlcers, which be like one ano∣ther in the matter, and the one were in a dry body, and the other were in a moyst body, then in the vlcer in the dry body, are such things to be vsed which be more drie, and in a moyst body apply remedies which do drie lesse, for to heale the same: therefore is Frankinsence, and such like to be vsed in moist bodies, because that it dryeth not forcibly. And on the contrary, Hart∣wort, Ireos, and such like things, which do drie forcibly, are to be vsed in dry bodies. Thir∣teenthly, the vlcers which yéeld a thick matter and be swollen, are to be cured with such drying things which do not bite, as Pomegranat péeles, decocted Plantaine and such like. Now concerning the cure, there shall be by each description especially declared, how that the purging, letting of blood, and such like shall be vsed: Here will we only discourse, as much as concerneth all old vlcers, what plaisters, salues, and other applications are to be vsed for them. Take old Barrows grease, Butter, Bucks suet, Hony, Waxe, and Rosin, of each a like quan∣tity, and a little wine; melt the same by the fire: afterwards take sallad oyle as much as is néedfull for a soft plaister: this being done, then wring it through a cloth, and let it be cold. This salue and all other salues which here insue, may be fréely vsed in all vlcers, obseruing al∣waies the difference betwéen heat & cold. Take sallad oyle & vineger, of each two ounces, Waxe halfe an ounce, brused Litharge of gold one ounce and a halfe, Verdigrease one dragme, let the Vineger be hot, & temper the other things amongst it, then séeth it togither vntill that it be red. This ensuing is very like vnto it: Take oile and vineger, of each two ounces, Waxe halfe an ounce, the litharge of gold one ounce and a halfe, Mastick and Verdigrease, of each one drag. séeth the oile and vineger so long till the vineger be all wasted, and vntill the salue waxe red. Item, take oile of Roses thrée drag. oile of Cammomill one drag. Ceruse one quarter of an ounce, Dragon blood and fine Bolus, of each halfe an ounce, Camfer one drag. litharge of gold halfe a drag. prepared Tuty one quarter of an ounce, Corall one drag. Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make a plaister; then spread it vpon a leather, and lay it vpon it. But before that there be this or that laid vpon it, the vlcer is to be oftentimes washed with this ensuing: Take white wine fower ounces, Rosewater two ounces, the white of a hard sodden egge brused small, burnt Allume one quarter of an ounce, Verdigrease one drag. séeth them all togither by a mild fier, and let it afterwards settle; then straine it, and kéepe it well stopt: and if it be too strong, then take more wine and Rosewater vnto it. This plaister following is called at the Apothecaries Basilicum, and of the Chirurgians, the water plaister. The same is especiall good for all dry sores, which be without matter or moi∣sture, and especially for the sinewes, for that it dryeth, clenseth, and causeth the flesh to grow, and is thus prepared. Take Waxe, Rosin, Oxe suet, Pitch, Turpentine, Frankinsence, Mirrhe, and Colophonium,Salue Basili∣cum other∣wise. of each a like quantitie: but first you are to melt the Waxe, and then the Pitch amongst it: after∣wards put the Turpentine into it, and then mixe the Mirrhe & the Frankinsence pouned small
amongst it. Now when it is cold, so that it may be handled with the hands, then must it be wrought thorowly with wet hands. Out of this will also a salue be made with oyle, like as be∣fore in the 14. §. you haue seene another. Item, in the second part, the third Chapter, and 9. §. is there one more, which beginneth thus: Take clarified Hony &c. which may be vsed for all hot and cold vlcers. The Chirurgians do vse this following vnder the name of the gréene plaister: Take Dogs grease, Waxe, Rosin, and Barrows grease, of each one ounce, Nightshade and Mallowes, of each one handfull: seeth the herbs to pap in Goats milke, vntill it be altogether thicke, after∣wards powne it all together, and temper it one with another. Wheresoeuer there be any Blisters which will impostumate or rankle, which the Chirur∣gians do call Cossos exulceratos, thereto are these salues ensuing to be vsed: Take lytharge of gold as much as you will, stéepe the same the space of two dayes in vineger, and powre off the vineger thrée times, and powre fresh vpon it againe; stirre it oftentimes about, and then let it stand in the hot Sunne: afterwards stirre it and bruse it the space of two or thrée howres in a leaden mortar, putting vnto it in stirring it, now and then, a little Vineger, Violets, and oyle of Violets, vntill it be thick: then at the last put two ounces of Ceruse vnto it, the iuice of Plan∣taine and of Housléeke, of each halfe an ounce, Camfer halfe a dragme, and two whites of egs, so make thereof a soft salue, and annoynt therewith all Blisters which be caused of heate, and all other exulcerations of the skin. The next day after is this disease to be washed with this water following: Take Dock rootes, Mallowes, and Violet leaues, of each one handfull; seeth all together in faire well water, and straine it thorow a cloth, afterwards temper it with Rose∣water as much as you please, and vse it oftentimes. Of a stinking and running vlcer. §. 16. THese vlcers or stinking sores do come of grosse and tough humors. When one will heale them, then is the patient to eate none other but light meates, and to drinke thin drinke, and to purge the watery and melancholy humors, to the end that thereby all affluent humors may be taken away. In like maner is the patient to be let bloud, if there be none other thing that letteth it: and to cut out all foule stinking flesh, or to bite or eate it out by some cautery, that there may grow new and good flesh in it, for the which these things following are very commodious. First, for to clense the vlcers, is speciall good the salue Mundificatiuum Apij, which is descri∣bed in the second part. Item, the salue of the Apostles, which may be found in the Register, and is maruellous good for all kinds of vlcers. This following is also much commended: Take Plantaine water, wine of Pomegranates, and Hony, of each two ounces, Verdigrease and Allume, of each one ounce and a quarter: boyle them together vntill it become thick, then apply it to the vlcers. Item, take vnripe Sallad oyle one ounce and a half, burnt lead three drag. prepared Tuty thrée quarters of an ounce, Mastick, Frankinsence, and Sarcocolla, of each one drag. and a half, séeth all together in 6. ounces of water of Plantaine vntill the water be wasted away: if you will make a plaister of it, then put as much waxe vnto it as is néedfull. This salue is to be laid with plegents in the vlcer. This ensuing doth clense and consume all bad matter of the vlcer: Take quick lyme foure ounces, oyle 16. ounces, Déere sewet 3. ounces, Waxe as much as sufficeth for a plaister or salue: melt them together, and stirre it so long vntill it be cold. Another. Take small sifted Otemeale eight ounces, the iuice of Marierom and of Nightshade, of each foure ounces, fresh Barrowes grease 6. ounces, temper them all together, and then lay it so thereon, the same doth ripen, coole, & mun∣difie. There is also well prepared a very costly plaister, which is called Gratia Dei, which is espe∣cial good for all stinking vlcers, fresh wounds, & for all bad flesh; iron, glasse, wood, poison, bones, and all that doth hurt in the wounds, doth it draw out and healeth it, which is made thus: The plaister Gratia Dei.Take Turpentine one ounce, Rosin 6. ounces, white waxe 2. ounces, Mastick half an ounce, Verueine, Betony, & the great Pimpernell, of each halfe a handfull: stamp all the herbs, & séeth them in strong wine, vntill the third part be wasted: afterwards straine it & wring it out. Then are you to séeth in this decoction the waxe, Rosen, & Mastick, stirring it alwayes about, vntill it be well mixed together, then set it from the fire, and put the Turpentine and the rest into it,
then stirre it very strong, so long vntill it be thorow cold. The Chirurgians haue also a plaister, which they do call the blacke plaister, which is very good for all wounds, vlcers, and Fistulaes,The blacke Plaister. and is thus prepared: Take Amber, Verdigrease, Sulphure, Lytharge of gold, Lime, and Bay∣berries, of each a like quantitie, pouned verie small, clarified Home, as much as is néedfull for to make a plaister or a salue. The salue of Egypt called Ʋnguentum Aegyptiacum doth also clense excéedingly all Fistulaes,Salue of Egypt. stinking vlcers, and clenseth them of the bad flesh, and is thus prepared: Take Verdigrease fiue drag. cléere Hony one ounce and thrée quarters, strong Vineger 7. drag. then seeth them togither vntil it be thick enough. It is an especial good salue for al stinking sores, to cause the same to dry. Item: take Verdigrease half an ounce, saltpeter one ounce, bruse them togither vpon a stone and set it on fire with a paper, then will the saltpeter be burnt: all that remaineth on the stone are you to lay with the stone and all, in a moyst celler, and the stone lying awry, then in time will there be an oile run out of it; then temper this oyle with Rose water, or with the white of an egge; it is too strong alone, but it healeth passing well. Item, these oyles insuing be also very good for such like vlcers, viz. oyle of egs, of Dill, of Lil∣lies, of blew Flower deluce, of Walfloures, and oyle of Tiles. Amongst the waters and such like be also good the two foresaid golden waters, which we shall describe hereafter in the last part, and M. Tristrams water, one of these, which one will, drunke or applied to the vlcer. For this may also be vsed a certaine ley tempered with Sallad oyle, which hereafter shall be described against the burning with gun-powder. Or make this following: take small cut Hartwort one quarter of an ounce, Assa foetida one drag. Centorie one dragme and a half, quick lime half a dragm; lay them altogither to steep in a pinte of Ley, afterwards séeth it vntill a third part be wasted, wherewith the vlcer is to be washed luke warme. Item, poune Hony suckle to powder, and let it boile well in wine, after∣wards lay this wine vpon the vlcer. The Chirurgians haue also sundry powders in vse;The red Powder. a∣mongst which there is one very common, which they do call the red powder, and is prepared thus: Take Colophonium one ounce, Comfrey, Bloodstone, or Argall, Dragon blood, and Momy, of each halfe an ounce, make a powder of all these: the same doth heale all vlcers, wounds, and Fistulaes, when they be clensed from all foule flesh. You may also vse it in all wounds. Item, take Beane meale halfe an ounce, mill dust 5. drag. Masticke halfe a drag. Dragagant, Gum, Momy, fine Bolus, and Dragon blood of each one scrup. temper them all togither, & strew it in the moist vlcers. Of this powder may one make also a plaister putting waxe and Turpentine vnto it, which most mightily doth dry all vlcers. It is also much commended that all they which be troubled with an old vlcer, ought to take one drag. of Mithridate or Treacle, more or lesse according to the ability of the person, and that with the water of Fumitory: the like may he also vse the stomachicall powder which is expressed in the first part, the second chap. and 1. §. beginning thus: Take Sene leaues, &c. which powder if so be that the patient doe vse diligently, he neede not feare at all of any bad vlcer. The Rosemary wine is also much estee∣med, for that it consumeth all excessiue moisture of the body, & kéepeth the body in good health. Item, if one wash the vlcer therewith, then will it both clense and heale it. Of the broken vaines called Varices. §. 17. OF these Varices or broken vaines, is verie much admonished in the fourth part in the beginning of the second Chapter. And although these broken vaines do ap∣péere most in the hips, & in the legs: neuertheles the same do also happen in déede in other parts of the bodie, where they be séene knobbed, greene, and blacke. These said vaines of the breast, do sticke full of Melancholie blood, and are verie ill to be healed. They which labour much with the legs, trauell much by land, do beare heauie burthens, and do eate many melancholike meates, are for the most part troubled with these broken vaines. Concerning the meanes whereby these broken vaines are to be healed, is that at first the Basilica be opened, and that the patient be purged with such medicines as expell melancholike humours, whereof there be sundrie expressed héere and there in this Booke, and that is also of∣tentimes to be done, and he is to beware of all grosse meates.
When as this hath béene continued a long time, then are the broken veines to be opened, and the blood to be let runne cleane out of it. Some doe also vse the actuall cauterie: yet must the vppermost veine be opened where it first beginneth, and afterwards to lay vpon it this salue or plaister: Take Ceruse, Antimonie, Lytharge of siluer, and burnt Lead, of each one ounce, sheepes suet fower ounces, Frankinsence, Momy, Sandaraca, Sarcocolla, burnt Allume, and Dragon blood, of each thrée dragmes, oyle of Roses, and Vineger of Roses, of each three dragmes, white Waxe and Rosin, of each halfe an ounce: temper them togither, and then make a salue or a plaister thereof: this is also good for all old vlcers, for it dryeth and swageth the paine. Item, Take Frankinsence, Masticke, Mirrhe, and Momy, of each one dragme and a halfe, the iuice of blew Flower-deluce two dragmes and a halfe, Hartwort, Southernwood, and prepared earthwormes dried to powder, of each one dragm, brused small, Lytharge of gold halfe an ounce, burnt Coperas, burnt Lead, Gals, Cipers nuts, the rootes Curcuma, white and red Corrall, and Roses, of each two ounces, Deere suet, and oyle of blew Flower-deluce, of each one ounce: poune all that is to be pouned, but the Rosin, the Turpentine, and the oyle are to be molten by the fire, and so tempered with the rest to a salue. Some do take Lupine meale, and make a plaister with water wherein Tamariscus is decocted, or with Goats dung & Wine. Also the vppermost members from whence this heauy blood falleth downe, are to be strengthe∣ned and their disease cured. The second Chapter. Of depascent Vlcers in generall. §. 1. FOr as much as we be now come to write of those vlcers which doe not continue in a place, but corrode hitherwards and thitherwards corrup∣ting the skinne, the flesh, yea sometimes the bones: therefore is it first to be knowen that these vlcers be called Phagedaenas: but for the more difference, such like vlcers haue their seuerall names: amongst which Herpes, Phagedaena, and Cancer, be the chiefest: the first whereof, to wit, Herpes, doth yéeld much thinne and subtile moysture; the Cancer, grosse, and tough matter; and Phagedaena, middle betwéene thin and thicke matter; but Herpes is not alwaies an open vlcer, but créepeth in time hitherwards and thitherwards like a Snake, whereof this disease also beareth her name; the one place healing, and the other excoriating a new: Phagedaena is a great vlcer, and corrodeth very déepe into the place and on euerie side of it: Cancer (which is the canker) shall hereafter haue his proper de∣scription. And albeit, these sores (as is said) do somewhat differ: yet are they for the most part comprehended all vnder the name of a Fistell, and it is thought that the Fistula is alwayes a cause of the other: therefore we will also first of all write of that. Of the Fistula. §. 2. THis name of Fistula (or Fistell in English) haue the Latinists first of all giuen vnto this vlcer, which doth signifie a Pipe: for as a Pipe is long and hollow; so is the nature of this vlcer also, being déepe and hauing in the beginning but a small issue: for which cause it is described, as hereafter followeth. A Fistell is an vlcer, the which round about it hath a callous skin, déepe, and long, penetrating into the bodie, and verie crooked, which be hard to close vp or to heale: and the which sometimes also in stéede of good matter, do yéeld a subtile moysture. It is found also that these Fistels do appeere verie little aboue in the skinne, and neuer∣thelesse do lie with their rootes déepe and hidden in the flesh, wherefore they be also the more dangerous to be healed, like as you may sée in the seuenth chapter, and eleuenth §. of the Fistell in the corner of the eies. Item, where we discourse of the Impostumes of the eares, and also of the Fistell of the gums which are all togither described in the first part, & in the second part, the third chapter, and nine §. In like manner also in the third part, the tenth chapter, and twelfth §. of the Fistula of the Arsegut. The causes of these Fistels may be precedent impostumes badlie
cured; or for that one hath stayed too long from opening of them, whereby the matter hath ea∣ten inwards, and so is turned into a Fistell. In like manner may also a Fistell growe of a wound which is not well mundified, also of fractures of bones, or any other bad humors of the bodie which lye hidden vnder the skin, and vnder the flesh, which do there corrupt the same, and be changed into a Fistell. The signes be these, viz. when one wringeth them, then be they without paine, if it be not that they stand somewhere about a sinew, or had some corruption in them. If so be that this Fistell be only in the flesh, then will the matter be white in a short space. Or if the Fistell be old, then doth it yéeld a long space thick and troubled matter: or if the Fistell be in a sinew, then is the matter thin and black, and if one wring it, then doth there runne out bloudie matter. If so be the same be in the bone, then doth there runne out thin and yellow matter. And if so be that it pearse into the hollownes of the bone, then issueth a fat oyly matter, whereby may easily be gessed that the marrow is spoyled, with other moe such like signes, which be discouered in the same places. Now for to heale these Fistels, must certaine articles he noted: First, because all Fistels procéede most of a waterish moysture, therefore are all drying things to be vsed vnto it, and the patient is to eate those things that make good bloud. Secondly, by reason that the mate∣riall cause is rooted in the bodie, it is necessarie to haue the same prepared and expelled. Thirdly, in old and very déepe Fistels, is it surest of all (if one will heale the same) that they either by incision or by an actuall cautery be taken away euen to the bottome, as to the con∣trary, the potentiall cautery because of the sinewes is dangerous and hurtfull. Fourthly, all Fistels that goe into the bone will neuer more be healed, if the bone be not first sealed. Fiftly, they that do go into the flesh, must of necessitie be dilated and opened, to the end that they may be the better mundified and dryed. The cure of this Fistell is of great importance, so that the patient is to order himselfe in ea∣ting and drinking, according as the first rule giueth notice, and to vse all drying things for it: also he is to leade his life in a dry dwelling, and there to settle himselfe. Fish and such like things be noysome for him, good flesh rather rosted than sod is commodious for him: his drinke shall be good wine: but because of the sharp matter, the same is to be somewhat watered. And for to prepare the matter of the Fistell, take Oxymel of Squils, or Diureticum and such like, which may also be vsed in the Fistell it selfe. These be then the things which may be vsed outwardly: Take Frankinsence and Aloe, of each one ounce, skummed Hony fiue ounces, séeth the Hony vntill it be thick. When it be∣ginneth to be cold, then temper the powders amongst it: at the last put one ounce and a halfe of molten Assa foetida vnto it, and rub it a good while in a mortar. This is a passing remedie to heale the Fistell, and also to cure all old vlcers, for that it clenseth the same, it consumeth all corrupted flesh, it separateth all scurfe and corrupted bones. Item, take Turpentine which is oftentimes washed with Sorrell water, foure ounces, the yolke of an egge, temper them together, and put sixe ounces of the iuice of Smallage vnto it, let it séeth together till the iuice be consumed; then adde halfe a dragme of Saffron vnto it: this clenseth and consumeth all that doth any hurt in vlcers or wounds, and it maketh also flesh to growe. Next vnto this plaister and salue may you vse the water which not long since in the first Chapter and 16. §. is described, beginning thus: Take small beaten Hartwort, &c. The Chirurgians haue also a kind of plaister which is not only good for all Fistels, but also for all wounds, and is thus made. Take Veruayne, Betony, Herba vulneraria, Buglosse, Agrimony, Consolida Saracenica, Yar∣row, Pimpernell, the great and small Plantaine, of each one handfull poune them all together, and wring out the iuice: afterwards séeth it in thrée pints of good wine, and wring it through a cloth, then put it into a Kettle, and put a pound of Turpentine vnto it, Waxe foure ounces, Colophonium eight ounces. This being all done, séeth it sufficiently, and when it beginneth to be cold, then stirre two ounces of pouned Mastix amongst it. For this is also very good the plaister of Gratia Dei, the foresaid water of Hartwort, the salue of the Apostles. Item, take the vrine of a man child, and rub it a long time in a leaden mortar vntill it be thick, afterwards let it dry vnto a powder, and then strewe this powder on the Fistell. The
powder of Ireos strewed also thereon causeth flesh to growe: the powder of Honysuckles is also very good for this vse. Rosemary wine, and such like moe that be discouered in the 16. §. be very good. Celendine pouned small, and so laid vpon the Fistell: or the iuice of the same dropt therein, doth heale the Fistels. For this may also be vsed the oyle of old linnen, as hath béene said in the first part. Item, make an oyle of watercresses, and spread it or lay it vpon the dis∣ease, wherewith it is mundified. Thus much be written of the Fistula, now will we procéede to speake and discourse of the running vlcers. Of the corroding vlcers, called Herpes. §. 3. THe name of this vlcer is as much to say as a Snake, like as we haue admoni∣shed alreadie, for that it créepeth forwards like as Snakes do, and remaineth not in one place, but windeth it selfe hither and thither, infecting most of all the skin only, without eating déeper inwards. The cause of this vlcer or sore, is the same with that of the other, to wit, superfluitie of Cholera, if she méerely remaine and abide in her proper nature, that is, if the Cholera be not mixed with any o∣ther humor: for that when this Cholera doth spread it selfe ouer the whole bodie, then doth it cause the yellow Iaunders, which by nature is of two sorts. When as now this Cholera is thick and grosse, then will the whole skin euen to the flesh be thereby damnified, and this vlcer will be then called Herpes exedens, which is the corroding Herpes. The other sort of Cholera is subtil∣ler, which remaineth (as is said) in the vppermost part of the skin, which doth singe the out side as if it were set a fire, the which without any addition is called Herpes, or Herpes miliaris, as ha∣uing the name of the Milet séed, for that this exulceration is like vnto it. The signes of these vlcers be these: the member loseth his naturall colour, and waxeth black, soft, and stinking; also if the pulse and the paine diminish, and in the meane while the vl∣cer doth so corrode, that if it be not lóoked to in time, the member must be cut off, or the partie must looke for death thereby. The remedies of these vlcers (saith Galenus) be these which are wont to be vsed for the cor∣roding Erisypelas, wherefore we may write so much the lesse thereof. But if it be perceiued that it begin to putrifie, then temper sealed earth and fine Bolus with Vineger together, and spread it round about the vlcer, and also in it. But if this wil not help, then be the corners round about the vlcers to be scarified, or lanced, and also to set boxing cups and horse leaches thereon, which may suck out the bad bloud; and this plaister following is also to be laid vpon it: Take Pease-meale, or Beane meale and sall, temper all together with the sirupe of Vineger, and lay it as a pap vpon it: the scarificed place must also be washed twice a day with Vineger, and then to an∣noint this salue following ouer it: Take Assa foetida, Nettle séed, and Hartwort rootes, of each halfe an ounce, Verdigrease one quarter of an ounce, temper it with vineger to the thicknes of Hony, and annoynt therewith the whole disease, and the places about it. And to the end that these vlcers may not corcode any further, then take Verdigrease, Allume, & Hony, of each a like quantitie, and vse it as is before said. The selfesame taketh away all bad flesh, & sustaineth the new flesh. But in case that through these foresaid things the rotting ceassed not, but dayly did corrode more and more, and the stench increased, then shall you strew thereon this powder en∣suing, to wit, pouned Hartwort and Gals, of each a like quantitie. Or take Dragagant and Coperas, tempered together with vineger, and if so be that this foresaid do not profit, then are the edges yea the whole accident to be cauterised with corrosiues or hot yrons: then take the rootes of Celendine, vnsleckt lyme, Eoperas, Mirthe, Hartwort, and Verdigrease, of each alike quantitie, tempered with the iuice of Plantaine, or pouned Orpiment alone tempered with the foresaid iuice. When as then the corosiues haue done their worke, and the crustes or stakes be yet hard, then must they be annointed with fresh butter vntill they do fall away of themselues, and afterwards those things to be vsed which are wont to ingender skin and flesh. The other sort of these vlcers is Herpes miliaris, whereof we haue admonished before. Some do call it Formica, that is, the Ant. This vlcer is also of sundry natures, and that according to the nature of the humor, whereof it is caused. It is also comprehended in thrée sorts or species: the one, which runneth hither and thither, which is caused of a subtile moysture, and is also quickly consumed: the second, that créepeth forward hither and thither, which is very hurtfull:
the third is of a grosse and hot Cholera, which entreth somewhat déeper into the flesh, and is mixed with some Phlegma, and thence commeth the Formica miliaris, which is hotter and harder to be cured. Out of all these foresaid reasons be the signes apparant, and before sufficiently re∣hearsed and discouered. Now for to remedy this accident, is this the briefest way; that first of all be prescribed to the patient a good order of dyet, like as is done in the Agues. For purging is he to vse sower Dates, Cassy, Epithymum with Rubarbe, stéeped in Endiue water, or whay of milke. If it be Herpes miliaris, then take Diaturbith. Further, you are to take Gals, Pomegranate pils, and fine Bolus, of each a like quantity: afterwards temper it with Rose water and a little Vine∣ger, and then annoint it thereon with a feather. Item, take the heads of salted fish, rost them in an earthen pot vpon the fire, vntill they be almost burnt, and then mixe them with strong wine, spread it vpon the disease: or take shéepes wooll, and frie it vntill it be blacke, then poune it, and temper as much Rose water amongst it vntill it be thicke, and annoint therewith the foresayd accident cleane ouer, twice or thrice a day, and then lay a white or blow cloth vpon it. There be yet diuers other sorts of im∣postumes and vlcers, which be of the same nature, differing in names and causes: but be∣cause we do comprehend them amongst the forementioned, therefore will we omit them, and especially because they may all be cured and holpen with these foresaid remedies. Of the hard Tumor Scirrhus. §. 4. BEfore we come to the third corroding vlcer, namely, the Canker; we must first of all admonish of this tumor, which the learned do call Scirrhus, of some Sch∣rosis, whereof we haue also made mention before in the third part, the twelfth chapter and the fift §. and that by reason that this Scirrhus hath great alliance with the Scirrhus of the Liuer. This Scirrhus is of two sorts, and both those are of the vnnaturall tumors of the body, whereof one is so hard, that it yéel∣deth at any hand; yea it is without paine and féeling, which is also accompted for incu∣rable. This swelling is of colour like lead or ashes, and is caused onely through Melan∣choly, the which is (as it were) dregs of all humors. The second hath but a little sense, and also some paine: for it procéedeth out of Melancholia and Phlegma, which be tempered togither, and is of colour like to the other. The same may also be cured, but not easily, as before we haue sufficiently written in the first chapter, and 11. §. This foresaid hardnes may be well caused of some former impostume, which is not well clensed or healed: whereas the corruption re∣maining doth clod and harden. The difference betwéene this Scirrhus and the Canker is, that in the compasse of the Canker there is heate, beating, and opening of the veines; whereof there is none with this Scirrhus: for that Scirrhus is without heate, without paine, and with∣out any sense or feeling, and also incurable. But forasmuch as this Scirrhus, doth appeare as well in other places of the body, to wit, in the liuer, milt, and stomacke &c. and that we haue written sufficiently in sundry places thereof, therefore it is not néedfull for to discourse here any further of it, but to procéede with the Canker. Of the Canker. §. 5. THis corroding vlcer, which is taken to be a kind of Fistell, hath her name of the sea Crab, which men call in Latine Cancer, which the Italians call Granizo, and the Grecians Carcinoma, not onely for that it créepeth hither and thither, but also like as Galenus witnesseth, for that many times this Canker hath béen séene, and especially in womens brests, in all sorts like vnto the sea Crab, for the veines do reach into the Canker (being filled with blacke blood) no otherwise, but as they were the feet of the sea Crab. This Canker is in the beginning very easie to be healed: but if it grow old, and hath rooted in too long, then hath it neuer béen seene that the same could be healed without incisi∣on. The cause of this Canker is a superfluity of melancholicke humors. Other do suppose that it is caused of melancholicke humors which be burnt by Cholera, or be partly tempered there∣with: whereof the Phisitions do make two kinds of tumors; the one being a melancholick & hard swelling, without any vlcer, and with little pain, as before (in the discourse of Scirrhus) we
haue shewed. The other sort is a corroding vlcer, as we haue before declared. The signes of a beginning Canker be these; the same beginneth first as a small beane, round, and darke of co∣lour, being tempered with gréene and black colours, and appearing with some heate and paine: it remaineth also immoueable in the same place where it beginneth: but herein hath the Can∣ker a difference with the Scirrho, viz. that the Canker is caused of burnt Melancholy, being tem∣pered with burnt Cholera: and the right Scirrhus of a thick melancholick humor tempered with Phlegma. Secondly, the Canker causeth also great paine and beating, whereof Scirrhus is frée. Thirdly, the Canker hath blacke and not red veines about it, as the Scirrhus or the Phlegmone hath. Fourthly, the Canker beginneth first to grow of it selfe: To the contrary, Scirrhus doth alwaies come after some impostume. Fiftly, the Canker is very sensible, and the Scirrhus with∣out any sence or féeling at all. For this hard Canker, which is not yet exulcerated, be these rules ensuing ordained: First, the patient is to beware of all meate which ingendreth burnt Cholera; of all spices, and of all things, which do heate the bodie. Secondly, he is to eate no meate, but that which maketh good blood. Thirdly, if at the first and in the beginning of the Canker he lay thereto all that which is necessary for it, then may the Canker be holpen, but the old Canker can be cured by no ma∣ner of meanes without incision. Fourthly, necessity requireth in this sicknes, that the body is to be opened with decocted Epithymo, which is also very méete for the lengthening of life, al∣though that it cannot yéeld perfect health. Fiftly, in the beginning is the Median to be opened. Sixtly, when a woman that is vnder fifty yéeres of age, hath the Canker, and hath not her termes, then must it be indeuoured that she get the same. Seuenthly, if it be a man, then is he to open the Pyles. Eightly, it doth not help to purge once or twice, but the same is to be done oftentimes; for that the humors which cause this disease are not easily taken away. Ninthly, by this foresaid order, and through all meanes which be possible, you are to indeuour, that the hard Canker be not opened. We must also ordaine an order of dyet. First, regard must be had, that the patient haue his dwelling in a temperate ayre, which is somewhat warme and moyst. Also, he is to take héed of all hot meates that may inflame the blood, and whereof heauy thicke blood might ingender; as Coleworts, Lentils, Beefe, Milke, Hares, Géese, salted or smoaked flesh, Beanes, Pease, hote spices, Onions, Garlicke, Léekes, Mustard, Cresses, Radish, and such like. Also the patient must beware of doing any kinde of labor in the Sun, or of ouer heating of himselfe by any meanes, and of drinking strong grosse wine. But to the contrary, he must endeuor himselfe for to eate and drinke none other thing but good hail meate, as Pullets, Hens, Lamb, Mutton, and Partridges: he may also eate all kinde of Riuer fish, which haue scales. Item, Parsley, Bur∣rage, Purslaine, Lettice, Pompeons, and such like, be also not forbidden him: fresh sodden Egges, Oaten pap, and Barly pap is also very good for him. His drinke must be cléere white Wine, which shall be alwaies somewhat watered. In fine, his whole gouernment must be moistening and cooling: and if so be that there be any heate with it, then may he eate and drinke Buttermilke. And like as the first rule giueth to vn∣derstand, the Median is in the beginning to be opened, and to let out as much blood as the abi∣lity of the patient can suffer: and further to obserue all things that the former rules doe teach. We haue not here to tell of any other remedies, because that we haue already written in fower places of the Canker, viz. in the first part, the eight chapter, and fift §. Item, in the se∣cond part, the third Chapter and tenth §. of the Canker of the breasts. Likewise also in the third part, the tenth chapter, and twelfth §. of the Canker of the Arsegut. Also in the third part, the 19. chapter and 13. §. of the Canker of the Matrix: In all which places one may most plenti∣fully sée, by what meanes these diseases are to be remedied. Neuertheles, all that which follo∣weth hereafter is very commodious to be vsed, viz. the plaister Gratia Dei. But before you vse this plaister, some do aduise, that round about the Canker should be well and déepe scarified, or to set Leaches about it, and to wash the scarified place thrée or fower times with a sharp ley, wherin Lentils be decocted, and afterwards to fill the vlcer with flat plegents, which be annoin∣ted with the salue of Egypt. But you shall vnderstand that the foresaid salue, like as also powned Agrimony, or the iuice thereof, (which be much commended for this disease) cause the good flesh to separate from the bad.
Take Lupine meale, Linséed meale, and Barly meale, of each foure ounces, the iuice of Wormewood, and Salt, of each halfe an ounce, Sope and Ley, of each a little, seeth them then togither to pap. Item: Take pouned Allume, and the powder of Earth-wormes, of each one ounce. Or take fresh Earth-wormes, poune them with the Allume, and so lay them vpon the disease. Item: Take Winelies, and Allume, of each a like quantitie, and so lay it vpon the can∣ker, and chiefly vpon the disease Herpes. For this is also méet the salue of Roses, which is discouered before in the Introduction. Like∣wise also the salue of Tutia, which is called Diapampholigos, or this following: Take Lytharge of gold, and Ceruse, of each a like quantitie, put them togither in a leaden morter with oyle of Cammomill, and Rose water, and rub it so long vntill it be as thicke as salue: this is as méete for the hidden and secret canker, as for the canker exulcerated. This insuing doth also with∣stand the canker that it grow no further, whether it be exulcerated or not: Take sealed Earth, ne Bls, and Ceruse, of each a like quantitie: temper it with the iuice of Lettice, or with the iuice of Housleeke, and then stirre it well togither in a leaden mortar as before, and spreade it on the canker. The muscilage of Fleawoort is also very good being tempered amongst it. The oyle of Sulphure, the oyle of Iuniper, whether it be distilled of the wood, or of the berries, tempered togither or each apart, be verie good for the canker. This powder following is also vsed to be strewed on this disease: Take burnt bones of a sound man, Cinquefoile, the rootes of Mandragora, and Orpiment, of each one quarter of an ounce, make a powder thereof, and be∣strew therewith the open canker: The Orpiment is very venemous and sharpe; notwithstan∣ding it is commended aboue all other for the Woolfe, the Fistula, Canker, and in the Vlcer Her∣oxedens, if one know prouidently to vse it. This Orpiment was woont to be tempered with the iuice of Plantaine, or with the iuice of Nightshade, and to make a cloth wet in it, and with the powder of the same to bestrew the vlcer, and then afterwards to lay the wet cloth vpon it. But when you will vse this Orpiment, then annoint the canker round about with fine Bolus, which is mixed with the iuice of Nightshade, for to frée the place from any inflammation. If so he that the sore be thereby distempered and swollen vp with heate, then lay one day or twaine the foresaid cooling herbs vpon it, and the paine will asswage therewith. If you will know whether the roote of the canker be taken away, that is to be knowen here∣by, viz. if it stinke no more, and if there begin any flesh to grow, like as is woont to happen in all other vlcers when they grow full of flesh, and be couered with the skin. It is a great abuse that some suppose that there is to be laid vpon the canker of necessitie the flesh of Hens, Ca∣ons, &c. the which the Canker should eate vp, and should lessen the maladie. There is also vsed in the exulcerated canker Mercurius praecipitatus, for that it is not so strong as the Orpiment. But the foresaid washing with Vineger, Ley, and plaisters, is much more surer and rather vsed. Item: take the rootes of Verbascum, and Docke rootes, of each halfe an ounce, the dryed ordure of a sound man one ounce, make thereof a powder, and vse that as the former. Or make a powder of Cheruill, temper it with Hony and lay it thereon, it heaeth much. The water of Carduus Benedictus should haue a great vertue against this disease. For the heate and inflammation of the Vlcers. §. 6. FIrst, for this inflammation may those things serue, which before in the 1. chap. and twelfth §. are ordained against the Rose. In like manner also all that which presently hereafter against the burning of fire and water shall be descri∣bed, and especially this insuing: Take oyle of Egs, and oyle of Roses, of each one ounce, Vineger halfe an ounce, black Hellebore ten graines: this being well tempered togither, it is especiall good for all inflammations of all vlcers. Other moe: Take Woolblade, poune it very small and temper it with Vineger, then lay it vpon the heate: Or steepe Quince kernels in water and annoint the heate with the mu∣scilage. Take Corne roses, and Waterlillies, of each a like quantity, beate them and lay them thereon: if you cannot get them, then take their water. For this is also good, the leaues of the Mulberrie trée: likewise also Poppie leaues decocted in raine water.
In like manner also broad Plantaine, and Bursa Pastoris layd thereon after the same order. The herbe Carduus Benedictus decocted and laid thereon, is also good: the iuice of Sloes spread vpon the heate, doth take away the inflammation. But if so be that the inflammation hath got∣ten the vpper hand alreadie, then is this following very good: Take strong water one ounce, and put therein one quarter of an ounce of Quicksiluer, and let it stand so certaine houres to∣gither: afterwards take a feather and annoint therewith the disease once or twice a day, then shall the Canker begin outwardly, and in other places moe to separate, till that the foule burnt flesh will fall out: afterwards vse the salue Apostolorum, or the salue of Egypt with flat pled∣gents therein, and that twice a day, afterwards lay some of the plaisters vpon it which be de∣scribed against the wilde fire. Item, for the cooling of this burning, take the oyle of Eldern flowers sixe ounces, the oyle of Saint Iohns wort one ounce, oyle of Turpentine halfe an ounce, let them so mixed the space of certaine daies, stand in the sunne, and then kéepe it vntill the time of néed. There be many moe sundry things which be very requisite for this, especially in the treatise of the plague, therefore we will not rehearse them at this present. The third Chapter. Of the Pocks, and of the lamenes which is caused thereby. THis sicknes and infection of the whole body of man, is placed by good reason next to the aboue mentioned vlcers, bicause they excéede all other vlcers, except the beforesaid in badnes: the which now a dayes when I did write this, hath béene knowen about the space of thréescore and ten yéeres, and from the time that King Charles of Fraunce 1494. did besiege the Citie of Neapoli; so that this disease vntill this present day is yet therefore called the French Pocks, and in Latine Morbus Gallicus. But the same sicknes was knowen long before in Spaine, whither long be∣fore it had béene brought out of the Indies, and out of the New found lands, like as also vntill this time it is called by some Scabies Hispanica: so that before that any one could cure this disease, people were burnt, launched, and cauterised most miserably, and rather spoiled than healed: but dayly experience brought by little and little more help and amendment for it. And like as the Quicksiluer and such like meanes were not so ure, there hath béene found out at last the vse of Guaiacum. Now concerning the remedies of this disease, I will first of all prescribe a processe of the auncient Phisitions (the which in those daies was found good) and is as yet not vtterly to be reiected, and afterwards alledge thrée of the most famous Phisitions for this sicknes, whereun∣to we notwithstanding shall at the last adde certaine good things moe, whereof each may chuse which one thinketh him to be most méete, and according to that the disease doth require. An order and cure of the auncient Phisitions. §. 1. AS soone as a bodie can perceiue that he is infected with this disease, then is he to keepe himselfe warme, to sweat much in hot bathes, to vse cupping, to be let blood twice: afterwards he is to remaine in a close chamber, and to let him∣selfe be twice a day annoynted with this salue ouer all his ioints, and then to sweate vpon it the space of two howers: and bicause that euery one cannot abide to sweat, then must heed be had to the strength of the patient, to the end he fall not thereby in any swouning. Purging is also needfull for this patient, which may be done as hereafter followeth: Take white Turbith halfe an ounce, Ginger one quarter of an ounce, Galingall, Masticke, Cloues, and Cardamom, of each halfe a dragme, Hermodactyli, Diagridion, and Sene leaues, of each halfe an ounce, Sugar thrée ounces: take one dragme thereof, or one dragme and a halfe at once, and
fast fiue howres after it. They write that this powder may boldly be giuen, and that it may be vsed also in other sicknesses. It is neuerthelesse very strong especially if one take one dragme and a halfe thereof: but in mine opinion two scruples is sufficient in weake men, and a dragme sufficient in a strong bodie for to purge sufficiently. The foresaid auncient Phisitions do also aduise, that one must take one quarter of an ounce of prepared black Hellebore, (viz. a strong bodie) stéeped in Goats milke, and strained, and then drunken, for that it cleanseth and healeth the Pocks: it is very good, but for strong persons it is strong ynough. For as much then as these foresaid medicines be very strong, therefore can I not omit to adde certaine things of the later Phisitions vnto that of the auncient, and to teach a safer meane, which all they which néedes must vse Quicksiluer, should obserue. For this you haue first in the third part the 11. Chapter and 20. §. the maner to make the infusion of Sene leaues, and how the same should be dronken with some kind of sirupes. These potions may one drinke three or foure times, euery day once earely in the morning: and afterwards (as the auncient Phisitions do aduise) the patient is to purge with pils De Fumo terrae one dragme, this is the common dose of them, but it may be augmented or diminished, according to the abilitie of the patient. You may also steepe Fumitory in Goats milke, or let them seeth together, and drinke thereof in the morning and euening: or you may drinke the water of Fumitory alone, for the Fumitory doth clense the bloud maruellous much. When as now the patient is well purged, then is this salue ensuing to be prepared: Take Frankinsence one ounce, Ceruse one ounce and a halfe, Lytharge of gold two ounces, Dragon∣bloud one quarter of an ounce, poune them all together, and sift it through a Sieue: afterwards take 16. ounces of molten Barrows grease, and so powre it as hot as it is vpon cold water, and so let it stand: this being done, then temper therein one quarter of an ounce of Quicksiluer, so long vntill you can see it no more. Some do kill the Quicksiluer in Turpentine, or vineger of Roses, but it is needles: now then how this salue is to be vsed, that haue we shewed at the first. They deuide the salue in foure, fiue, or sixe parts, and they spend in the inunction euery day one part, according to the abilitie of the person. But because that after this inunction the mouth will be sore, they do vse for it Allume, and Barly water, and let the patient wash his mouth therewith: Or they take a pinte of wine, and halfe as much vineger, halfe an ounce of Allume, two spoonfuls of Hony, and temper them together. With this do they gargarise the mouth when the tongue is excoriated, to wit, with a ragge which is tyed to a stick, which hath beene described in the first part, the first Chapter, and 3. §. Before times the sick persons which were infected with this disease, were wont to be more plagued with lamenes, and for that do they vse this bath following: Take refuse of iron, make them glowing hot, and then cast them into a closed tub, afterwards take Cammomill, Marie∣rom, and Thyme, seeth them, and make with both the vapors a bath: then dry off the sweat with warme clothes, continue this the space of eight dayes together, or so long, till that you be whole, at each time, the space of an howre. Item, take small pouned Frankinsence, temper it with two ounces of Aqua vitae, stirre it oftentimes about, and then annoynt therewith the members which be lame. If so be that the patient haue any vlcer, then take foure ounces of Barrowes grease, Quicksiluer one ounce and a halfe, salt Lard, Dogs grease, Beares grease, and Badgers grease, of each three quarters of an ounce, temper them all together. But note, that you must vse the salt Lard in no other salues, but when you haue old vlcers in hand. For the foresaid old vlcers is this powder following to be vsed: Take Salt, and white Ar∣gall, of each a like quantitie, burne them together in hot ashes. Also stinking vlcers be made wet with this ensuing: Take halfe an ounce of Mercurij Sub∣mati. Allume thrée quarters of an ounce, Ceruse one ounce, bruse all together very small vpon a small Marble stone, put a pinte of vineger vnto it, and make a cloth wet therein, and there∣with wash the vlcer. Take Mercurius Sublimatus halfe an ounce, Aqua vitae twelue ounces, then annoynt the vlcers with it: this is very strong. Of the lamenes, and of the extenuation of the members, hath beene spoken before in the fourth part, the seuenth Chapter and 2. §. for the lamed member of the Pocks. This is in fine the meanes whereby the auncient Phisitions were wont to heale the Pocks.
How to decoct Guaiacum. §. 2. BEfore that we come to the curing of the Pocks which is vsed in our time, which hapneth for the most part by the decoction of Guaiac, called Lignum guaiacum, and Lignum sanctum, we will first of all teach how this dyet drinke is to be decocted and prepared of Guaiac, as followeth hereafter. The decocti∣on of Guaiac.First, take small filed or shauen Guaiack 16. ounces, Stechas, field Cipers, rindes of the same beaten small 12. ounces, Carduus Benedictus, S. Iohns wort, yellow Lillies, and Betonie, of each one handfull, first put the wood and the pouned rinds in a leaden earthen pot, and then powre thereon seuen quarts of water: let them stand in stéepe to∣gether the space of a whole night, being stopt tight too: afterwards set the pot to séeth easily, when the fourth part is consumed adde the herbs vnto them, then put two quarts of wine vnto it, couer the pot close, and let them coole. The rinds, wood, and herbs, are to be dryed, and well kept for to haue the same vsed againe another time, as shall hereafter be taught. The second manner: Take rinds of Guaiacum eight ounces, Guaiacum foure ounces, pouned small together, well water fiue quarts, let them stand and stéepe together about the space of 24. howres, then seeth it all together vntill about the third part be wasted. Take it afterwards from the fire closed very tight, and let it stand so asteepe the space of twelue howres: straine it thorow a cloth, and wring it well out, afterwards powre vnto it as much white wine (which is not swéete) as the potion is, then cast two ounces of Hermodactils into it, and kéepe this potion as before. The third sort: Take foure quarts of Renish wine, and eight ounces of grated Guaiac, pou∣ned rinds foure ounces, Betonie, and pouned Licorice, of each one ounce, then let it stand astéepe the space of 24. howres, and afterwards seeth it to the halfe: straine the potion through a cloth, and drinke thereof morning and euening the space of fortie dayes, each time foure or fiue ounces. The fourth potion: Take thrée quarts of wine, rasped Guaiac eight ounces, pouned rinds foure ounces, Licorice two ounces; let them séeth well together, and afterwards powre foure quarts of wine vpon it, and let it séeth againe vntill the fourth part be wasted. These be now the most vsuall manners to make this decoction, yet may the same be altered according to the importance of the sicknes, and according to the strength of the patient: now followeth heere what order the Phisitions now adayes do obserue in healing the Pocks. Another manner to heale the Pocks. §. 3. BEfore the patient begin to drinke, he ought first to be purged, for which the Cas∣sie is most méete: also he is to be let bloud. But especially this is the most fittest meane: Take Sene leaues, Polipodie rootes, and Currans, of each three quarters of an ounce, séeth them all together in sixe ounces of Fennell water vntill the third part be wasted. In this decoction are you to stéepe the space of a whole night Rubard and Aga∣ricus, of each one dragme: afterwards wring it out, and put vnto it one ounce of the hony of Roses, whereof you are at least euery morning to take one draught thrée dayes together, and afterwards to obserue this order following. The next day after the taking of these potions, must he in the morning betimes drinke foure ounces of the decoction of Guaiac, as is taught before in the second §. and that as warme as he may abide it: then is he to sléepe or rest one howre. He is to drinke so much againe and rest, and do this the third time. But after the third draught, he is to arise, and shall according to the old custome breake his fast, and that of such meates which be light of digesture. His drinke that he is to drinke on day times, is thus to be prepared. Take the wood and the rinds whereof the first drinke hath béene decocted, and then powre water and wine vnto it (as is sayd) and let them séeth together vntill the fourth part be con∣sumed, and this must be his daily drinke, but this may be altered diuersly, according to the qua∣litie of the cause. Against the euening is he to drinke of the first potion a good draught very warme, and an
hower afterwards he is to go to supper, and so continue this vntill the fift day; but the sixt day is he to take the potion with Rubarb. The seuenth day he shall take none other but a spoone∣full of this composition following: Take small powdred Guaiac one ounce, Mace half an ounce, hony of Roses two ounces, temper them together. The eight day he is to begin againe as be∣fore, to drinke of the first decoction, and so continue the space of ten dayes together, vnlesse it be found good to augment and increase it. The eighteenth day is he to take againe the infusion of Rubarb, and the two dayes following: Then is he to vse none other thing but Hony tempered with the powder of Guaiac. Afterwards is he euery day thrée howers after euery mealetide, to take three ounces of this potion ensuing. Take Iuniper berries, and Bayberries, of each two ounces, Mustard séede halfe an ounce, powne them all grosse, and séeth them in foure pints of water vnto the halfe. As long as one doth vse these things, he must kéepe himselfe out of the ayre, and remaine in a warme chamber, for that thereby the matter of the Pocks is expelled outwards towards the skin: and when you find that it breaketh out, then is he to wash himselfe with these things fol∣lowing: Take a quart of Vineger, Allume, and Verdigrease, of each one ounce, eight wel bray∣ed whites of egs: powne all that is to be powned, and then wash him with this Vineger: when he hath thus washed him therewith, and especially where there be any scales, then are they to be let drie, and the scales will fal off of themselues. Thus fareth it with this second cure, which is very safe, without any defect of the inward or outward parts, by which meanes there be a great number cured. And as we haue said, his meate must be light of digesture, viz. young flesh, egs, and all that is drest therewith; also all other things which make good bloud: but Milke, Chéese, Fruit, and such like be very highly forbidden in this disease. For this may also be vsed the golden water, which standeth described amongst other in the last Part, whether it be drunken, or annointed outwardly vpon it. So is also Treacle highly recommended for the same. The third cure of the Pockes. §. 4. THis cure ensuing haue I tried my selfe in a woman, which had vsed many sun∣drie cures, and could not be holpen: but by this meanes following she grew to be so healthie, that I knew her twelue years after alwaies in very good health, without any hinderance of the same disease. First of all in this disease (like as in all other such like) the patient is to be purged, and that according to the abi∣litie of the person, and strength of nature. Further, in eating and drinking he is to order himselfe like a woman in Childbed. After the purgation, he is to take a good warme draught of the first and strongest decoction, which is before described. Hauing taken the same, then is he to be couered warme, to the end he may sweate well, euen so much as his power may well permit. The sweate is to be dried well with warme clothes: and it were very good that the clothes wherewith he hath bene once dried should be washed euery time, and that he put on a cleane shirt euery morning: for if the patient kéepe him warme and cleane, then may the potion haue her operation the better. At meales, and throughout the whole day may he vse this potion following: Take boyled rinds and Guaiac, lay them to stéepe as before, and séeth them. This may also be done euen to the third time, and then to mixe all the three decoctions together. When one hath about two quarts of the very strongest decoction, then must he set againe to stéepe fresh Guaiac and rinds, to the end that one may betimes haue more drinke in a readines. If so be that the patient haue any outward sore or scabbednesse, then is he to wash the same with the dregs of this potion or lay it vpon it with a cloth: and if so be that the sore be somewhat déepe, then be pledgents to be layd into it, which be made wet in the dregs of this decoction. This is so to be done in the morning after sweating, and in the euening one hower before supper. And if so be that these pledgents were baked therein, like as it hapneth also, then are they to be wetted with a litle of the warme potion, and then to lay fresh to it againe. The clothes wherwith his sores be once drest, are not to be vsed againe without washing. Now when as these sores be almost healed, and the flesh would grow too proud, there is then a
fine powder to be powned of the rinds, and to be strewed oftentimes thereon; and also to be let∣ten lye vpon it, vntill that there fall off drie scales: this powder drieth much with all pain. But if so be that it be a rich person, that had néed of the vse of this potion, then is he to take of the best Rhenish wine, for that it is more penetrating than any other, and also not too hote. Of the fourth cure of the Pockes. §. 5. IT is first here to be noted, that in all these medicines ensuing, no proper or due rules are prescribed, for that they be not set downe by one Phisition only, but gathered together out of sundrie mens works, according as the cause requi∣reth: wherefore euery one is (as he thinketh best) to chuse that which liketh him best. And for that cause be all these remedies ensuing ordained most for them which could not be healed by the former decoction. First, it is néedfull that the patient aboue all things, and before he vse any sirupe or purga∣tion, do take one ounce of well washt Turpentine, with a little flesh broth, or water of Fumi∣torie made warme: for this prepareth the way for all other Phisicke, to penetrate the bet∣ter through the whole bodie. So that it hath bene found before times, that thereby the wor∣king of the medicine hath bene perceiued euen vnto the great toe. Whereby it may be knowne, what a power Turpentine hath to open the way for Phi∣sicke. This Turpentine is also giuen with the decoction, or with Malmsey, and it may also be made much stronger. Take Turpentine as much as you will, and put it in a glasse; afterwards set it in the warme Sun, and temper a little Sugar from day to day amongst it, then stirre it well about. This is especiall good for the head, for the breast, for the paine of the belly, for the grauell, and for the laxation of the bodie. And to come againe to our purpose: This sirupe following is especiall good for the Pockes: Take Sene leaues, Epythimum, yellow Mirobalans, Sebestes, Licorice, and Rapontica, of each halfe an ounce, field Cipers three dragmes, Polypodie rootes, Fumitorie or the iuice thereof, Hops or their iuice, of each twelue ounces, flowers of Burrage, of Violets, and Comin of each thrée drag. cut all that is to be cut, and let it seeth together in fiue quarts of wine, vntill about a quart remaine: afterwards take of this decoction a pint, & temper therwith the sirupe of Fu∣mitorie, and of Hops, of each two ounces, Oxymel of Squils one ounce and a halfe, sirupe of Violets one ounce, good Sugar as much as you please: then take take thereof thrée ounces at once, and that with Endiue water. You may also take this decoction with the infusion of Sene leaues, or water of Fumitorie certaine daies together, augmenting or diminishing the same, according as you would haue it for to purge: this being done, you are to purge with Cassie or any other thing, according to the qualitie of the cause, as is beforesaid. You haue also in the third part, the 14 Chapter, and 5. §. many kinds of things, which be al good for the Pockes. Of the letting of bloud we haue also spoken before, which also doth much good in this sicknes, because that the bad bloud is thereby diminished. But therein is no certaine order to be giuen, but you are to order your selfe therein accor∣ding to the qualitie of the cause and abilitie of the person. But it is alwaies especiall good that the Hemorrhoides be opened: for if they bleed not too much, then do they preserue one from the Pocks and Leprosie, as we haue taught in the tenth Chapter, in the beginning of the 5. §. Before that now the inunction or Stricado be vsed, it is first excéeding néedfull that one fo∣ment the ioynts, and that he take for it, Calmus, Marioram, garden Mints, Horehound, Bay¦berries, Southernwood, and Docke rootes, of each one M. cut it all together, and seeth it in well water, vntill about the third part be consumed: with this decoction before and in the annoin∣ting, foment the members which are to be annointed, and afterwards with warme clothes drie vp the sweate, and then annoint them: this is to be pursued, as long as the annointing indureth, which is commonly foure or fiue dayes, and vntill the paine doth come in the teeth, the mouth and the flesh of the téeth excoriateth, and the phlegme doth excessiuely begin to issue and run, then is the inunction to be stayed. For this be many kinds of salues prepared, and
chiefly this following: take Barrowes grease sixe ounces, Quicksiluer killed with the iuice of Sage three ounces, blacke Sope three quarters of an ounce, Argall beaten small one ounce: make a salue thereof, and stirre it together in a mortar the space of halfe a day, that it may be very well tempered together. This salue ensuing is very much vsed at Augusta: Take fresh Butter halfe an ounce, Bar∣rowes grease two ounces, Treacle and Mithridate, of each one quarter of an ounce, mortified Quicksiluer one ounce and a halfe, prepared Litharge of gold and salt, of each one dragme and a halfe, oyle of Foxes, and good Aqua vitae, of each one quarter of an ounce, Saffron fiue graines,Vnguentum Mrcuriale. afterwards temper them all together: this salue is called Ʋnguentum Mercuriale, and is by rea∣son of the Treacle and the Mithridate much safer than any other salue. Item take Barrowes grease one ounce and a halfe, Turpentine and Quicksiluer, of each halfe an ounce, powned Bayberries one drag, and a halfe, oyle of Iuniper one dragme, oyle of Euphorbium, and brused Cinober, of each one quarter of an ounce: temper it together. Item, take Barrowes grease foure ounces, Quicksiluer two ounces and a hale: seeth it all together in sufficient Vineger, and put vnto it ye ashes of Bechen wooo two ounces, oyle of Bay one ounce and a halfe, Masticke one ounce, Frankinsence one ounce and three quarters; temper them all together so long, vntill that the salue be blewish: and then annoint therewith the patient but once a day, for that the salue is strong. Note also that in case if any bodie be annointed too much with Quicksiluer, then is the iuice of the greater Pimperneil to be giuen him to drinke, wherewith some be holpen, in whom the Quicksiluer was séene to lie in the veines. And because there appeare sundrie accidents through the inunction, viz. Ach of the teeth and gums, rawnesse and swelling of the throate, excessiue slabbering, weaknes of nature, binding of the bodie, and such like, therein one must also be prouident. First, the paine of the gummes is to be remedied with the iuice of Wormewood, wherein whites of Egges be brayed; to wit, if one wash the téeth and the flesh of the teeth with it, and cleanse the throate also with it. It helpeth likewise for this to cleanse the mouth oftentimes with shéepes milke. Secondly, take Rose water, and honie of Roses, or other cleare Honie tempered with Whay. Thirdly, this ensuing is much commended: take the iuice of Laurell, and cleanse therewith the mouth. Each one may trie this that will. Some do aduise, that the mouth must be clensed with cold water, or with the iuice of Night∣shade, for that thereby will the fluxe of the mouth be stopt. Fourthly, chew Linséede, or the rootes of Woolblade. Fiftly, this disease is to be eased with a kind of fomenting of the members, which haue bene annointed before with warme water, wherein Rosemarie and Sage is decocted. Sixtly, it is néedfull, that the patient liue very soberly, and do vse good strong brothes, and other forcible things, and that all his meates and drinkes be also mixed with all that which doth strengthen and fortifie the heart. Seuenthly, there is to be vsed for this, Conserues of Roses, of Buglosse, of Burrage, Manus Christs, with Pearles, and such like things that strengthen the heart. Eightly, there is a common Clister to be set with Henbroth, Sugar, yolkes of egges, and with Salt, thereby to resist all accidents and obstructions of the bodie: and in great weaknesse of nature is he to vse Sugar of Violets. Ninthly, prepare this salue: Take Gum, Beares grease, and oyle of Roses, of each a like quantitie: temper them together with a little oyle of Balsam: then is the patient to annoint therewith his face, both the temples of the head, and his hands: for thereby shall he get againe his naturall colour. Now to preuent those foresaid accidents, giue the patient one ounce and a quarter of Cassie, to wit, after the fourth inunction. And when he beginneth to slabber, then hold againe from annointing, vntill two daies afterwards: then purge him againe after the third or fourth Stricado. When you do preuent the matter in that maner, then will the putrifaction of the mouth not be so hurtfull. For the sore and foule gums is this following very good: wash the mouth oftentimes with
Vineger, wherein some Allume is molten. In the euening and morning be the téeth to be an∣nointed with the salue of Egypt: but beware of swallowing the same salue downe. For the rot∣ting or putrifying of the gums reade in the first Part, the 13. Chap. and 7. §. what is written there against the foule gums. Item, take hony of Roses and the iuice of Mulberries, of each one ounce, Plantaine water 8. ounces, Allume one quarter of an ounce, then temper them together, and vse it to the washing of the mouth. You may also set boxing cups vpon the shoulders. For the Pockes that haue continued long. §. 6. IF so be that this sicknes be so stale or old, that it be not well to be holpen, then giue the patient a Pill with Quicksiluer which is killed with the iuice of Limons, and with as much Rubarbe, viz. of each about one scruple: if the paine be very great, then temper therwith Opium, and Saffron of each two graines. This is to be done alwaies about the second day, when he goeth to bed, or that he let himselfe be annointed the space of eight daies, where otherwise he ought to be annointed the space of three or foure daies. But alwaies after the fourth inunction is the patient to be purged, and to omit ye same day the inunction, and afterwards to go on with the inunction vnto the end of the same eight daies, and when the eight daies be compleat and ended, then is he to drinke the decoction of Guaiac, made after the common manner. When as the third part of this decoction is spent, then put vnto it two ounces of Rapontica, Turbith halfe an ounce, Carduus Benedictus, half a M. Agaricus half an ounce, Sene leaues half a M. the rinds of Guaiac foure ounces, good strong wine one quart, then let so much thereof séeth away as there is wine put vnto it. If so be that this will purge too strong, then giue him rather ye potion of Sene leaues, which is described in the third part, the eleuenth Chapter, and 20. §. euery second day. These pils al∣so ensuing may be vsed for purging: Take Rapontica, Rubarbe, Manna and Aloe, of each one dragme, Ginger and Spica of Indie, of each sixe graines: temper them all together with the si∣rupe of Fumitorie, and make sixe pils of one dragme waight, and take thereof euery euening twaine. The pils Aggregatiuae, and de Lapide Lazuli are also good for this purpose. If there be great paine with it. §. 7. IF now there be great paine with it, then take Frankinsence, Litharge of gold, Argall, Masticke, Ceruse and Allume, of each one quarter of an ounce, oile of Bay and Aqua vitae, of each one ounce, Barrowes grease fiue ounces, mortified Quicksiluer one ounce and a halfe, then temper them together vnto a salue. This salue doth mellow all cores, and cleanseth all vlcers. Item, take Sallad oyle, the oyle of Foxes, or oyle of Costus sixe ounces, and seeth therein one drag. of Quicksiluer; the same flyeth away, but the force of the Quicksiluer remaineth still. This oyle swageth all paine of the Pockes maruellously. Or take the spirit of wine, which is foure times distilled, sixe ounces, Quicksiluer which is mortified in Coperas water, one ounce and a half, yellow Sanders thrée quarters of an ounce, Allume two drag. Lignum Aloes one drag. Muscus eight graines, Ambra fiue graines, stéepe all these things together in the spirit of wine, and make a cloth wet therwith, and wash all the pla∣ces, where the paine is: Or make a cloth wet, and lay the same vpon it, and especially vpon all the ioynts. Another: Take oyle of Roses foure ounces, washt Earthwormes and Turpentine, of each halfe an ounce, Salt two drag. let it seeth well together, and so lay a cloth dipped in it, vpon all the ioynts: you may also temper the oyle of Foxes amongst it, and then it is not onely good for the sinewes, but also especially for all paine of the Pockes. Of the Byles in the Pockes. §. 8. IF there appeare any blisters or byles in this sicknesse vpon any, then annoint the same thrée times a day with a salue which is before described in the first Chapter, and twelfth §. beginning thus: Take small powned Litharge of Gold, &c. But the expert Phisitions
for the Pockes do déeme that there is nothing better for the Byles of the Pockes, than vnflect Lime tempered with blacke Sope, for that this openeth the skinne, and thereby will the paine also be taken away. You haue also in the fourth part, the sixt Chapter, and second §. in the description of Sciatica, two very good & safe salues made of Hollihocke rootes, and Elecampane rootes, for to mollisie all hard nodes or knots. The gray plaister Diachilon may also be vsed very well for it. But in case that the same be so hard, and so irremediable, that they must be opened by a po∣tentiall cauterie: we will put a meet Chirurgian in trust with the same, yet we will here teach the making of a corosiue to be vsed at néede, which is thus to be done. Take Vine stickes, burne them to ashes, and ashes of Beechen wood, of each a like quantity, powre sufficient water vpon it, and then let it run foure times through a bagge. Of this ley take three quarts, and put vnto it blew willow ashes, vnsleckt Lime, ashes of the Vine and of the Béech tree, of each halfe a pound: let this stand so the space of eight dayes in a wood∣den vessell, stirring it about euery day three or foure times; afterwards filter it so long vntill it be very cleare. This Lye are you then to séeth in an iron pan vpon a good fire, so long till it be sodden thicke enough. Now for to know whether it be enough, sticke a quill into it, and if the fethers do fall off, then take the pan from the fire, and hold it on one side, to the end it may run all together, and may be hard. It is also here to be marked, that when as in seething it begin∣neth to make bladders, or bubbles (like as pappe is wont to do) then is it a signe that it is suf∣ficiently decocted, and then cast it on a boord, and cut it parcel wise. When it is thorough cold and waxen hard, then kéepe it in a glasse stopt very close and tight, in a drie place. Another: Take vnslect Lyme, Vine ashes, Willow ashes, Argall, and burnt Saltpeter, of each a like quantitie, powne it all small, and put it in a new pot: afterwards powre sharpe Lye vpon it, and so let it stand three dayes space, but stirre it oftentimes about: filter this Lye so often that it be very cleare, at the last seeth it and kéepe it as before. For all open sores in the Pockes. §. 9. TAke Cerue as much as you please, and Sallad oyle as much as is néedful and a little Vineger and Rosewater, bruse them together vpon a rubbing stone, and annoint therewith the running sores of the Pockes, and other. Item: Take oyle of Roses, Saltpeter, and péeled Almonds, of each a like quantitie, Camfere a little, then rub it all together as before. For this may you also according to the importance of the cause temper small brused Tuty, for that this healeth maruellous well all sores, and especially those which do stand about the throate: but if it be feared that they eate too deepe inwards, then are they to be annointed before and after meate. For the Scales and other spots. §. 10. TAke oyle of Camelina, and oyle of swéet Almonds of each foure ounces, Butter and marrow of Oxe bones, of each thrée ounces the grease of Géese and of Ducks, of each one ounce, white Waxe two ounces, make a salue thereof. This salue hath a maruellous vertue in mollifying all scales, impostumes, and other scirrho∣sities which procéede of melancholie, and all hardened sinewes. Will you then haue this salue to asswage the paine more? then temper the brayed yolkes of three egges a∣mongst it, and one dragme of Saffron. If you then desire to haue it pierce more stronger, then take Bdellium and Ammoniacum, of each one ounce; dissolue them in Vineger, and put them amongst it; then séeth them vntill that all the moisture be consumed, and stirre it together one amongst another. Now for to heale all cicatrices, markes and spots, vse this ensuing: Take a pound of Sulfure, beate the same grosse, and séeth it with water in a couered pot: but looke to it, that there go no vapour out of it: afterwards hold the member ouer it, and receiue the vapour
thereof: afterwards annoynt it with swéete Butter. You shall also find good things for this in the description of burning. The fourth Chapter. Of the Leprosie. AL famous Phisitions do estéeme no disease vpon earth to be more terrible and hurtfull than the right Leprosie: for this malady doth so vehemently infect the bodie, that it not onely inféebleth all the members of the whole bodie, but spoileth and putrifieth also the same on all sides, that the mem∣bers will fall parcelwise from the bodie: and it taketh away vtterly his whole naturall essence, for that his nose will be crooked, broad, and falne downe, his lips great, thicke, and swolne, and his eares sharpe; so that these people besides that they be disdained and despised of all the world, as if they were the filthiest creatures on earth, they must liue and die in misery. And to the end that we might partly learne to know the misery which is caused through the Leprosie, these are the most common signes; the falling out of the haire of the beard & the eybrowes, hoarse spéech, a short, heauie and stinking breath, great continuall thirst, hardning and swelling of the spléene, vnnaturall heate of the liuer and of the kidneyes, wherewith is commonly grauell also: the pa∣tient will be vexed with terrible dreames, and will be much plagued (as it is commonly sayd) with the night-Mare. He will also be vexed with much wind of the belly, & with great binding. Also the fingers and toes do rankle and swell, the nailes do sliuer and cleaue, and spoile, that at last they do fall out. Wheresoeuer they haue any opennesse, there runneth out alwayes a black, loathsome and stinking matter. Otherwise they haue ouer the whole bodie a hote, irksome and itching scabbednesse with blisters and scales, which for the most part do appeare in the throate and in the nostrils, whereby they do take away the breath from the patient. He getteth thicke cornels or knobs on the skin of the thighes, legs and féete, which do get a numbnesse, whereby the naturall liuely colour is altered into a dead, blacke and blew colour. The eyes do also get another forme or fashion, whereby their sight is darkned. These be now (like as is sayd, and shall yet be sayd) the most common signes of the Leprosie, especially of that which the learned do call Elephantiasin, whereby all the foresaid signes do shew themselues not all at one time, but alwayes a good part of them. It hapneth also wel, that other∣whiles but one member only, or some part of the bodie is infected with this disease, and not the whole bodie. We will also discouer somewhat here of the causes of this sicknesse. It may be caused of a bad aire, as in time of the plague, by conuersing or dwelling besides Leapers, or by much speech with them; for that through their venemous breath may one be easily infected. And this is such a disease, whereby the one is not onely infected of the other, but the children also do inherite the same from their parents; so that whether the man or the woman be infected with it, the other will soone take it also. This miserable sicknes is wont also to be caused of great anger, long sor∣row, feare and faintheartednes, whereby much melancholicke blood is ingendred, and then out of it the Leprosie. Item, of the long vse of melancholick meates, as Pease, Beanes, &c. old chéese, Goates flesh, Beares flesh, Foxes, Asses, and measelly Swines flesh, all old salt flesh, grosse fish, milke and fish eaten together, and such like things moe. Item through too hote a liuer, whereby the blood is burnt The Leaprosie is diuided by the learned into foure parts, and each species of the same called after a certaine beast, for that it hath a little likenesse to the nature of the same beast: whereof the first is Leonina, of the Lions, the second Tyria, of the venimous snake Tyro: the third Alopecia, of the Foxe: the fourth Elephantiasis, of the Elephant. The first species hath her name of the Lion, for that they that be therewith infected, be ra∣ging and mad, as otherwhiles the Lions be. This species is caused through an ouerheated and burnt blood, whereby they also get a deformitie of the face, which is horrible to looke vpon: they do crie out, and beate their bodies so vehemently that their owne skin doth thereby harden:
they be also so hungry and thirsty, that they cannot be satisfied: they are also depriued altoge∣ther of sleepe, vntill that at last they be very mad and distraught. Concerning the second sort, it is well knowne throughout all the world, that the Snakes do at a certaine time renew themselues, strippe off their skinne from them, and do get a new: the which also happeneth in this sort of Leprosie, otherwhiles ten or twelue times a yeare, so that their skin goeth off with great heate and sharp paine, out of which runneth a subtil matter which infecteth the parts round about it: and this not only therefore, but also for that this kind of Leprosie doth infect and hurt all other people dwelling by. This Leprosie is also contagious, that all whatsoeuer he spoileth doth stinke none otherwise than do the holes of these sorts of Snakes Tyri. The third species which is called after the Foxe: it is very well knowne that this beast is subtil and rauenous, also frequenteth vnknowne and secret holes: also commonly twice a yeere commeth to cast his haire, and at last consumeth vtterly. This species of Leprosie is also of this nature, that the patient can by no meanes be per∣swaded for to vse any counsell, but feareth alwayes that he shall be extenuated. At the first haue we admonished, that the patients beard and the haire of his eyelids will fall out: the same hap∣neth in this also, for that because his meate and drinke can alter into no naturall nourishment, therefore will not onely the nourishment of the haire be taken away, but also the sustenance of the whole bodie, whereby the patient must attenuate and consume. The fourth species receiueth her name of the Elephant: the cause of this Leprosie commeth through the vse of all bad and melancholicke meates, the which cannot sustaine a bodie, nor in∣gender sound flesh, but do rather spoile and destroy the same. In like maner do they also cleane change the natural colour of the body, & make the same a darke gray, like as is the colour of the Elephant. Other are of opinion that this name procéedeth of a lothsome sight, for that this dis∣ease hath a lothsome sight. In like manner also for the altering of the voice, which séemeth like to the voice of an Elephant, with other moe such like things. But for that at the first in all such leaprous people the head oftentimes and the whole bodie do swel so, that one may say very wel that he is like to an Elephant: their face is sometime so terrible to looke vpon, that one should be affrighted of the same, as of a terrible beast; for that their face, fingers and toes be full of sores, and those so great as a Nutmeg or Beane, and of the colour of a Mulberrie, which is not as yet throughly ripe. When as these come to impostumate, then do they yéeld (as is said) a stinking matter: the eyelids do also swell sometimes so thicke as a finger, afterwards they do split and cleaue. But this is not all, for they do hurt also the mouth, the throate and the nose so wonder∣fully that the patient can hardly get his reath, and do alter afterwards commonly into the can∣ker, and into all such perill, that he commeth to stifle thereby. The eares be aso commonly ful of sores and scales, and be also sometimes eaten vp that they fall off, yea do so eate inwards that they make the patient vtterly deafe. The arteries and other veines of the necke will be appa∣rantly filled ful of thick and clotted blood, wherby the voice wil be hoarse and vlcers and blisters do appeare in the ioynts with a great hardnes of the spléene, and is almost a generall numbnes of all the members, so that they cannot vse them. Lastly (which is most of all to be wondered at) this sicknes doth commonly cause the great rupture Buris, wherof we haue written in the third part, the first chapter, and 8. §. Out of these foure species of Leprosie may each expert man well gesse, that the first species is caused through a burnt cholericke melancholy: the second species out of a phlegmaticke me∣lancholy: the third out of melancholy which is mixed with blood: and the fourth of a burnt melancholicke matter: therefore this last kind of Leprosie is much worse than any of the rest. This may suffice of the nature and causes of the Leprosie. Now we will come to the Physicall meanes which may be vsed against it. For this aboue all are these generall rules to be obserued: First, although the Leprosie hath setled her roote, yet letting of bloud is good, but very little, like as also no strong purgations be good: for when this sicknesse is confirmed, then is the matter without the veines and in the out∣ward members, out of which it is not to be expelled. Secondly, this sicknesse is not to be driuen away, but onely at the first through the purging of the melancholicke, and other bad humors. Thirdly, I take that there be much spoiled blood instant, then is a veine to be opened, whether it be in the arme or vpon the hand. But if there be not much blood instant, then is letting of blood
to be omitted. Fourthly, both the veines of the throat (wherof we haue written in the Introdu∣ction) are to be opened in great hoarsnesse, and that especially if one be afraid of stifling. Fiftly, there be in the beginning no strong medicines (especially Hellebore) to be giuen, for that this matter is not to be purged, but it is rather to be put in practise with mild things which do purge melancholy. Sixtly, each one that is infected with this disease shal beware of venery. Seuenth∣ly, neither bathes nor salues are to be vsed before and vntill that the patient be duly purged, for the grosse matter doth obstruct the pores. Eightly, the flesh of the snake Tyrus, and all things wherein the same shall be tempered, are very meete for leprous people, and aduised to be vsed by all learned men. Of meanes and medicines against the Leprosie. §. 1. THe famous Phisition Galenus doth write thus: the Leprosie is an alteration of naturall warmth, which appeareth with terrible and itching sores. And yet in another place he doth admonish that (in the beginning of Elephantiasis) he hath healed it through letting of blood, and through strong purging of melancholy: therefore must these sicknesses at the first (and as soone as they can be perceiued) be remedied; for which one is to imitate this processe ensuing: and although the same be more inclined to the healing of Elephantiasis than to any of the other kinds, neuerthelesse the same is méete to heale all Species of Leprosies. An order of diet. §. 2. FOrasmuch as melancholy is of a drie and colde nature, therefore must (to the contrary) warme and moist things be vsed for to mitigate the matter ac∣cording as the humor is waightie, meane, little, and venemous. First then concerning the ayre, the patient is to kéepe himselfe in a méetely warme and moist ayre, and that especially about rockes that are lying towards the East, the South, or towards the North, and also about some springing fountaines. But if the wind commeth to blow ouer some odoriferous trées or flowers, then is it the better: but if one cannot get such an aire, and that the time of the yeare be very hot, then sprinkle the chamber with fresh water wherein Violets, Waterlillies and Lettice be decocted. Also lay these Trociskes insuing vpon hote coales, therewith for to fume the chamber: Take Violets and wa∣terlillies, of each one ounce, the séeds of Lettice, of Endiue, and of small Endiue, of each halfe an ounce, the seeds of Melons, of Pompeons, of Gourds and of Cucumbers, all together péeled, of each one dragme and a halfe, Starch halfe an ounce, Camfer one dragme; make Trocisks there∣of with the iuice of Lettice, each about halfe an ounce in waight. When the same be dried, then powne them to powder, and let the patient therewith fume his dwelling, viz. in the morning, at noone, and in the euening. Although now his dwellings were situated towards the North, and towards cold winds, yet is this fumigation very requisite for him, but the leaues of apple trées, or of swéet Pomgranats, or of Almonds, or such like decocted amongst them are to be put vnto it: also all his linnen, and especially his shirts are to be washed with the same water. In like maner also are his clothes to be fumed. Further, this bag insuing is to be prepared for to smell vnto it. Take sealed earth and fine Bolus, of each one quarter of an ounce, the flowers of Burrage, of Buglosse, of Basill, of each one dragme and a halfe, Violets and Waterlillies, of each one quarter of an ounce, Camfer halfe a scruple, wild Vine leaues, Broome flowers, and Lettice séed, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, powne each alone, temper them very well one amongst ano∣ther, and then bind it in a fine cloth. He must also beware of all such clothes as do wring the head and the breast too hard, or be too narrow. The hands and the féete are in sommer with lin∣nen, and in winter with good warme shéepes pelts to be kept warme, and also the head preserued from all cold. Concerning his meate, it should be very good that all his bread were kneaded with water of Purslaine, of Lettice of Endiue, or with some such like waters, a little salted, but meetly baked, and not eaten before it be two dayes old. All his flesh must be light for to be digested, as namely
Pullets, field fowles, fat Duckes, Partridges, Phesants, Finches, wood Pigeons, and such like. Amongst all other flesh is good for him the flesh of yong Goates, Lambs, Calues, yong swine, of yong Muttons, Harts; and especially of yong Conies, yong house doues and Hares, shal he not eate, because that the melancholicke humors by them are ingendred. All riuer fish which is not slimie, is very good for him, rather sodden than rosted. All fruit that is sweete, as Cherries, Cres∣ses, hasell nuts, Almonds, Muscadell grapes, and other sweete Grapes shall not onely be per∣mitted, but much rather be aduised for to vse them. In like manner fresh Figs, and water drun∣ken vpon it, Peaches, sweete Apples, and swéete Pomegranates are very good in this sicknesse: but all sower fruite is to be forborne, for that vineger and all whatsoeuer is sower doth harme much the melancholicke persons. Walnuts, Chestnuts, Quinces, Seruices, and such must he forbeare. The decoction of red and white pease, and these gréene herbes, viz. Spinage, Lettice, Beetes, Endiue and Purslaine be very good for him, and especially if some Fennell be chopt a∣mongst them. Item, ripe Melons, because they coole and moisten, are not ill for him. Milke is also for this sicknesse not discommended. All hot spice, as Pepper, Cinnamome, Galingall and Ginger are hurtfull vnto him, for that the matter thereby is the more burnt. But for to preuent the consumption, this powder following is to be prepared: Take Saffron one dragme, Cinna∣mom two dragmes, Mace thrée dragmes, the séed of Violets, of water lillies, of Sorrell, and of Endiue, red and white Coral, red and white Saunders, of each one dragme, powne each alone, and temper them together. Item, he may also vse Hens grease, Duckes grease, Calues sewet, Mutton sewet, if it be not much salted, for all these sewets be much better in this sicknesse than butter. Léekes, Garlicke, Siues and Radishes are to be refrained, or at leastwise vsed very sel∣dome. In like maner also salted fish, salted flesh, and such like. The stomacke, the liuer, the heart, and chiefly the spléene of what beasts soeuer they be, is he not to eate, howbeit the braines of beasts being sodden are not ill. As concerning his drinke, he is to beware drinking of all kind of red thicke wine, and also of all white wine which is strong, and ascendeth or climeth into the head, but a mild, white, and swéete wine which is not strong. And if this kind of wine cannot be had, then is his wine to be tempered with good well water or fountaine water. When it is cold weather, then may he vse Hony water, which from twentie quarts of water and one quart of Honie is decocted vnto the fourth part. When the Grapes be ripe in the forepart of winter, then is alwayes this wine fol∣lowing to be prepared: Take one hundred quarts and a halfe, or two hundred quarts of sweete Must, and stéepe therein twelue ounces of gréene small Endiue cut very smal Elecampane roots eightéene ounces, the seede of Docke and of Sorrell, of each one ounce, then put it all together in wine, and let the wine stand ouer a yeare and be very cléere. If the wine be now too strong, then temper in the drinking good well water with it, or let it séeth together. Of this wine is he to drinke all the whole winter euen to the end of March: but from the moneth of March vntill the end of the moneth of September, then take Must and fountaine water, of each one hundred quarts, Liuerwort, water Cresses and garden Cresses, of each sixe ounces, gréene Citron leaues twelue ounces, cut them very small, and let it séeth all together. When this potion is cleansed, then drinke it as before. The patient is also to sée to it that he eate not without hunger, nor drinke without thirst, and and especially if his stomacke be not well framed. To the contrary, he is not to fast any longer than till he féeleth that the meate in his stomacke be cleane spent. Many dishes or messes be not good for him, but all spoon meates that are thin are very meet for him. He is to beware of all dry meats. He is also to hold him sober in drinking, that the meate come not to swim in the stomack. If so be he find after meate that his meate do trouble him, then is he to take this following for to parbrake it out againe: Take thrée ounces of water wherein Radishes be decocted, white su∣gar and hony, of each halfe an ounce, Salgemmae three graines, Comin fiue graines, Vineger two ounces, temper them together and drinke it luke-warme. But in case that the vomiting wil not yet follow after it, then thrust your finger or a fether in your throate as déepe as you can, which is made fat with oile. If it will not yet be, then must it be looked to, that the meate come not to rot in the stomacke, and there ingender an ague of it, which is to be done with this potion fol∣lowing: Take fresh prepared Cassie which is prepared with water of Violets one ounce, water wherein the herbe Mercurie hath bene decocted three ounces, then make them warme together, and drinke it at one good draught.
Of sleeping and waking. §. 3. THey that be burthened with this disease, ought to sléepe the space of eight houres at the least, and to go to bed one houre after meate, and to turne oftentimes about from one side to the other. The head is to lie very high, and to sléepe halfe sitting. When it is cold weather, then is he to couer his whole bodie, & especially his head very warme. Reasonable exercise is very good for him, if so be that he can exercise himselfe. His head must he let be oftentimes and softly rubbed. Last of all he is to beware of all motions of the mind, as from anger, sorrow, and such like, for that these things do augment the burning of the melancholy. Let this suffice to be spoken of the order of diet, whereof we shall hereafter discourse more at large, and teach also how this matter might be diminished and expelled. Of letting of blood. §. 4. WE haue before expressed in the generall rules how that letting blood in the con∣firmed leprosie may not auaile, except it be séene that the patient be very full of blood: for which, setting of boxes is also very commodious, whether it be in the necke, the shoulders, the thighes, or vpon the calues, and vpon other places mo according to the importance of the cause. But if so be that the Leprosie be not rooted, then is first the letting of blood to be vsed, and that for an vnburthening of the noisome matter. But if now the patient be very plethoricke, and the veines be full of blood, then must one open the patients Median in the left arme, and let out three or foure ounces of blood. Or if there ap∣peare such fulnes of blood about the liuer, then is the liuer veine to be opened in the right arme. But if there be any fulnesse in the veines about the head, then is the head veine to be opened, and that vpon the hand about the great thomb. This letting of blood is in the beginning of the Leprosie, one of the most principallest medicines and meanes, because that the burning blood can through no more commodious way be expelled. After letting blood (or if it be not estéemed néedfull) do all learned commend the potion of E∣pithymo, whereof there be thrée sorts in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, and eight §. described, whereof the patient shall take in the morning betimes foure or sixe ounces very warme, and then to sleepe one houre vpon it, for it is a very mild laxatiue, and afterwards he is to fast sixe houres after it. But if you desire a weaker potion, then take fresh rootes of Polipodie, powned Sene leaues, Thymus and Epithymus, of each one dragme, Mirobalani Indi one quarter of an ounce, Whay fiue ounces, Annis, Cinnamome, wild yellow Rape seede and Mace, of each halfe a scruple, and beate it small, and steepe it the space of 24. houres in warme Whay, afterwards wring it out, and so giue it to drinke. Item, take the confection of Sene leaues three quarters of an ounce, and temper it with whay of Goates milke: this is a safe and elected medicine. This following is somewhat stronger: Take Sene leaues one dragme, Indy salt, prepared Azure stone, and fine Bolus, of each two graines, then giue it warme with thrée ounces of the water of Hops. Or take two ounces of the iuice of the leaues of Polipodie, temper it with one ounce of good wine vnto a potion. If you will haue this more pleasant, then take the distilled water which is distilled out of the leaues and rootes of Polipodie. Had you rather take pilles? then let these following be prepared: Take Polipodie, Thymus, and Epithymus, of each fiue graines, prepared Azure stone, and fine Bolus, of each halfe a scruple, Annis, Mace and Ginger, of each two graines, Indy salt three graines, then make thereof se∣uen or nine pilles, and that with the iuice of Roses for to be taken at one time. After this, may one bring together many purging things, but these beforesaid be sufficient for a patterne and example. The clisters may be made thus: Take Burrage, Buglosse, the vttermost of the Agaricus, Elecampane rootes, and fresh Polipodie, of each one handfull, then séeth them all together in sufficient water vnto the halfe, then take thereof twelue or sixtéene ounces for a clister, without any other addition.
Another. Take of this foresaid decoction twelue ounces, Butter halfe an ounce, then temper them all together: Or take good swéete Wine wherein Mallowes and Violet leaues haue bene decocted foure ounces, confection of Sene leaues and Cassy, of each half an ounce, Indy salt one scruple, temper them well together, and then set it very warme as a clister. Here followeth a stronger: Take Coloquint, Mirobalani Indi, Emblici, Epithymus, Thymus, Fumitorie and Sene leaues, of each one handfull, séeth all together in sufficient water euen to the halfe, and vse them without any other addition for a clister. There may also be taken sixe ounces of the decoction wherin an Hedgehog is boiled, and putting therto foure ounces of the oile of Violets, Indy salt one dragme, confection of Hamech thrée quarters of an ounce, and temper this together vnto a Clister. But this following is the mildest, and notwithstanding the most commodious: Take whay of Goates milke 12. or 16. ounces, Cassie one ounce, and set it warme. If it be séene that the matter do annoy more the head than any other member, then is this laxatiue potion to be vsed: Take the confection of Diasena and Hamech, of each three dragmes, the decocted or distilled water of Betonie, water of Violets, or of the Sauine trée, of each one ounce and a halfe, temper it all together. If so be that the breast be most of all infected, then take Aga∣ricus one dragme and a halfe, Mirobalani Indi one quarter of an ounce, fresh Polipodie, and the huskes of the Sene leaues, of each one dragme, Fennell water, and water of Hyssop, of each two ounces; make it warme, and stéepe the rest the space of 24. houres in it: afterwards drinke it warme in the morning early. Or if so be that these melancholicke humors do bruise the Liuer most of all, and the rest of the intrailes, then is this following to be vsed: Take Annis, Spica, Violet séede, Cuscuta seed, Sorrell séed and Masticke, of each halfe a dragme, Roses, and the leaues of the wild Vine, of each foure scruples, séeth them all together in sixe ounces of water euen to the halfe: take of this decoction and temper therein of the confection ad melancholiam Auicennae. These be now the things whereby all such noysome humors may be diminished. First it is to be considered how the grosse melancholike blood might be drawne from the vitall parts to the outside: for this is very good after the vse of the former purgation that the patient do forcibly stir and exercise himselfe, viz. to go a foot, and to clime vp to the mountaines, whereby natural heate might be prouoked, and the matter consumed. Secondly, it is very good that he be rubbed from the necke along the backbone downewards, and from the shoulders to the hands, and from the thighes to the féete with hote clothes, vntill the skin be very red. Thirdly, he shall bathe in this bath following morning and euening: Take fresh or drie Fu∣mitorie twelue ounces, the Elecampane leaues, Violet leaues, and small Housléeke, of each sixe ounces, Cammomill, Melilot, and Spica Romana, of each eight ounces, séeth them together in so much water as is néedfull: in this shall the patient bathe, and be softly rubbed. Fourthly, prepare this salue following: Take oyle of Sesamum sixe ounces, Cammomill, Dill séed, Burrage flowers, and Fumitorie, of each one dragme, flowers of Elecampane & Dock seed, of each one dragme and a halfe; powne them all small, steepe them, and seeth them all together in the foresaid oile vnto the halfe: afterwards annoint therewith the bodie twice or thrice a day, and especially the whole backbone, and also all other parts which are infected. There is also vsed for this hote and blistering herbes, viz. pouned, wherewith the members may be rubbed, whereby the bad humors be drawne outward toward the skin: these herbes be Marierom, Penniroyall, wild Thime, Nepe and Crowfoote, which haue an especiall power for to draw out the melancholike humors towards the skinne, changing them into water, through the blisters which appeare after this chafing. Some do vse Cantharides, but they are too strong, for they expell vrine very violently, yea that the blood followeth with it, and do excoriate the conduits of the vrine if the same be vsed at any one time in many places. For this is also good boxing cups set on the outward members, and the skin picked. If so be that there be any other sorenesse or impostumation with it, then haue you before in the second § how the patient is to parbrake, the which is very méete for this. But in these cases there is nothing better than to open the hemorrhoides, which may be effe∣cted by the rubbing of fig-leaues, or by the rubbing with the leaues of Comfrey: also with rub∣bing with an hairen cloth which is stéeped in an Oxe gall.
There may also a small boxing cup be set vpon the fundament, and when as the arsegut doth appeare and come forth, then may the veines which do as then appeare be opened with a lan∣cet, and to let them bleed so long, vntill that the thicke and grosse bloud do alter into cleare and thin bloud. This is also to be done foure times a yeare, for it is very commodious. For to expell the matter of this sicknes by vrine. §. 5. AFterwards it is also verie méete, that this noysome matter be driuen out tho∣rough the vrine, for which you are to vse one ounce or more of the potion of Epithymo, or of the water wherein Epithymus is decocted, whereof the patient is in the morning and also at afternoone to drinke, for that it driueth out a blacke and melancholike vrine. Or take in the morning early one ounce of the iuice of Smallage. Item, take three ounces of the iuice of Pease, or the decoction wherein Pease be boyled. There is also Azure stone sodden in the water of Millet, and take thereof three ounces: Take Indie Spica one quarter of an ounce, Mirobalani indi thrée dragmes, séeth them in nine ounces of Fennel water euen to the halfe, afterwards straine it through a cloth, and wring it out hard, and then drinke it. The floures of Broome be also taken for this, Madder, Valerian and Mew, of each one handfull, let them séeth all together in eightéene ounces of water vnto the halfe, and then drinke thereof foure or fiue ounces with powned Licorice and Gromell seed, of each halfe a dragme tempered therewith. Wherewith the Mouth and other parts are to be washed. §. 6. TAke the decoction of Linséede foure ounces, and Oxymel compositum two ounces; temper them well together, and wash the mouth oftētimes with it alwaies twice before supper, and two houres before diner. You may also after the same manner chew Swines bread and spit it out againe: or in stead thereof chew Agaricus, which is more forcible and more safe. Item prepare this gargaisme ensuing: Take Mirobalani Indi, Violets, Burrage floures, and Buglosse floures, of each one dragme, the rootes of Polipodie one quarter of an ounce, Indie salt one dragme, the huskes of Sene one quarter of an ounce: seeth them all together in twelue ounces of water euen to the halfe, and vse it warme alwayes one houre before noone, and an houre before supper: to wit, ten or twelue times together. This ensuing is also much commended for the Leprosie, if it be often washed therewith in the beginning: Take Mirrhe and Sarocolla, of each thrée dragmes, Ireos, rootes of Fumitorie, of Mew, and Hart∣woort, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, blacke Helleore two ounces, the séeds of Mallowes, of Hollthocks, of Fumitorie, and the leaues of Elecampane, of each thrée handfuls, cut them and stampe them together, afterwards let them séeth in two quarts of water vnto three pintes. In like manner there is also much commended for this the golden water, if that one do take a little and oftentimes thereof, and do annoint the Leprosie therewith. The oile of Tiles is also much commended in the beginning of the Leprosie. But because the most principall cure of this Leprosie consisteth in consuming of the melan∣cholike matter of this sicknesse, and that the bloud must be well cleansed: therefore will we to that end describe certaine good things, beginning first with the least. Whereby the bloud in the Leprosie shall be cleansed. §. 7. TAke the water of Hops, and of Fumitorie, of each one ounce and a halfe, tem∣per them together, and giue it in the Sommer cold, and in the Winter warme. Item: Take the whay of Goates milke, or of Sheepes milke, and drinke thereof in the morning like as is said before. This following is also more forcible: Take fower ounces of Cheese whay made of shéepes milke, and the iuice of Fumitorie, temper them
all together, and so drinke it warme. These thrée things haue an especiall propertie with the brest, with the liuer, & with the stomack, and do consume all burnt humors of the same. Item: Take the sirupe of Epithymo one ounce and a halfe, the water of Elecampane, of Sorrell, and of small Endiue, of each one ounce and a halfe, temper them together, & drinke it certaine daies together: the same expelleth the grosse matter. This following is also meete for the same: take Syrupum de Thymo, Acetosum compositum, de Byzantijs, of each halfe an ounce, water of Smallage, and of Fumitorie, of each one ounce and a halfe, and vse them as before. This ensuing is especiall good for the Melancholie which is caused through burnt bloud, and where it may euidently be séene, that heate of the liuer, of the breast, and of the head is with it: Take the séedes of Melons, of Cucumbers, of Pompeons, and of Gourds, of each three drag. flowers of Violets, of Burrage, Buglosse, and of small Endiue, the séede of Sorrell, of small Endiue, and of Waterlillies, of each one handfull and a halfe, Fumitorie flowers, Elecam∣pane rootes, red and white Saunders, burnt Iuorie, red and white Corall, of each one dragme, the iuice of swéet apples sixe and thirtie ounces, fresh Mallowes, Endiue, Sorrell, Hops, Pur∣slaine, and Lettice, of each thrée handfuls, Dock leaues, Elecampane rootes, Bistorta, Swines bred, and Gentian, of each one handfull, wild Vine leaues, small Housléeke and Liuerwoort, of each three handfuls, séeth this all together (except the iuice of Apples) in foure quarts of wa∣ter vnto the halfe, afterwards wring it out hard and straine it: this being done, then put to this decoction the iuice of Apples, and thrée ounces of sharpe Vineger,, white Sugar sixe and thirty ounce, then séeth them all together (alwaies skumming) by a mild fire, vntill that about the third part be wasted, whereof you are to kéepe the one halfe, and the other halfe are you to séeth to a sirupe; for that of the first is euery day to be taken fiue ounces, and of that which is sodden to a sirupe two ounces, with water of Agrimonie, and Fumitorie: to wit, of each one ounce and a halfe. This hath done maruels, but it must be continually vsed the space of sixe wéekes or two moneths. This sirupe (as also all other) is alwaies to be taken when the meate is digested in the sto∣macke, and afterwards to sléepe an howre or twaine, and then with out doing any great labor, to fast fiue howers after it. In Sommer it is to be taken cold, and in Winter lukewarme. For to consume the remanent matter. §. 8. WHen you do perceiue that this matter is much diminished, then giue the patient during the space of a moneth, alwaies early in the morning one dragme of pow∣ned Nepe with Shéepes whay, for it is a safe remedie. In like manner you may giue vnto this patient some dayes together one ounce of the iuice of Marsh mints or of white water Mints, and that especially in the beginning of this sicknesse. The powder of burnt Hedgehogges flesh hath an especiall power for to consume this mat∣ter, if that one take the waight of a dragme oftentimes with Whay, or giue him oftentimes halfe a dragme of Treacle with the decoction of Hedghogs flesh. These be now sufficient and sure things chosen out of diuers others. If so be that there remaine any bad matter in the ioynts, then must the same (if one will haue perfect health) be also consumed, to the end that thereby (the same there remaining) the whole bodie be not infected againe. For which these two bathes are to be vsed at the first: take Marioram twelue ounces, Bayberries, the seedes of Licebane and Mustard séede, of each sixe ounces, Sulphur vise foure ounces, the Earth called Sinopida two ounces, then séeth them al to∣gether in much water vnto the halfe, then bath therewith the space of fiue or sixe dayes twice a day. When the patient commeth out of the bath, then is his whole bodie to be annointed with Treacle, and the same to be rubbed in well. Afterwards he is to go to bed, and to sweate well vpon it: and although he could not sweat well at the first, yet giue him after bathing halfe a dragme of the Treacle Diatesseron, with a little water of Violets, and then couer him close. When he hath thus bathed, then is he to vse this bath following: Take Fenegréeke, and the séedes of white Sesamum, of each twelue ounces, the rootes of Lillies sixe ounces: then let them séeth together to a bath as before, yet in bathing is the bodie to be rubbed with black Sope, and then to ly a bed as is said. When as nowe the matter is sufficiently prepared through bathing, and drawne to∣wards
the skin, then doth the cause require that it might be consumed, whereto stronger medi∣cines be necessarie, like as this ensuing may be prepared: Take Verdigrease, Orpiment, Cope∣ras, and white Cadmia, of each sixe ounces, vnsleckt lime twelue ounces, the rootes of Crowfoot eighteene ounces, Allume foure ounces, Salarmoniack eight ounces, powne them all together, and then distill them in a helme, as strong water is wont to be made, and annoint therewith all scales and blisters euery where. The third day are you to annoint them with this following: Take one ounce and a halfe of Starch, and washed litharge of gold two ounces, vnsleckt lime one dragme and a half, Dragon∣bloud halfe an ounce, Vineger as much as is needfull for to temper together, afterwards tem∣per them together in a leaden mortar. Other do vse this following: Take the swet soote of the chimney two ounces, lytharge of gold one ounce, Frankinsence halfe an ounce, Mastick fiue dragmes, oyle of Iuniper, and oyle of Wheate, of each foure ounces, yellow Waxe two ounces, powne all small that be to be pow∣ned, and then temper therewith two ounces of the oyle of Violets, afterwards put vnto it the gold lytharge, the Masticke, and Frankinsence, and at last a little Vineger, yet stirring it al∣waies about. Other do temper amongst it sixe ounces of the iuice of Cuccopit rootes. What is to be vsed for the Scales. §. 9. IF that there be any scales vpon any sores, then are they to be annointed with this salue following: Take the oyle of Sesamum, Asses sewet, of each sixe ounces, the yolke of an egge, Camfer halfe a dragme, then temper them all together with sufficient whites of egs, it is also good against al heate of the ioynts, it hea∣leth and causeth the flesh to ingender. If so be that these foresaid scales will not fall off of themselues, then do some take them off with Rasors, euen to the roote, yet not altogether at one time, but one before, and another afterwards. The bloud do they staunch with powned litharge of gold. They do make also a salue with fresh Hares bloud, or with a young mans bloud, which is very meet for this. The annointing with this salue is to be done but once in thrée dayes, and then to wash the par∣tie with some water wherein Bran is decocted. You haue also more at large of these things in the Chapter where the Pockes be discoursed of. When as after all this the matter procéedeth well the space of two or thrée moneths, then is one not to foreslow purging in the meane whiles, but to take good heede to these two things ensuing. First, to the stopping of the nose, which maketh an vnseemely spéech, and for to let that, make a long taint of Cotton, annoint it with the salue of Citron (which one findeth commonly ready at the Apothecaries) strew theron small powned lytharge of gold, or Hartwoort, or in the stead thereof take the conection of Aurea Alexandrina. Further, you are to spout in the nose some lukewarme wine, amongst which a little vine∣ger of Squils is tempered. Secondly, because that the haire of the eyelids fallen out do giue a great deformitie, there∣fore it is to be looked to, that the same be made to grow againe, whereof you may reade in the sixt Chapter and 8. §. But this ensuing is especially commended in the deformitie: to wit, that the eyebrowes be rubbed vntill they be red, and then are Leaches to be set vpon it: and when as they be fallen off then haue this salue following prepared: Take fresh Venus haire, and Laudanum, of each a like quantitie, seeth the same in oyle of Bayberries, and a little wine, afterwards wring them out, and therewith annoint the eyebrowes, and all other infected places. If so be that there euer appeare any new matter, or any new impostume, then must one be∣gin to bath with the last foresaid decoction, and in like manner also to annoint with the fore∣said things, for that in such lingring sicknesses, must the remedies so oftentimes be reiterated as the diseases make returne.
For to strengthen the Hart, the Liuer, and the Braines in the Leprosie. §. 10. BEcause that by the foresaid parts and other moe this Leprosie taketh her begin∣ning, therefore are the same to be strengthened: for which this following is very good: to wit, the confection Laetificans Almansoris, whereof giue euery day (halfe an hower before noone) one quarter of an ounce with Endiue water, the water of water Lillies, or with water of Agrimonie. Secondly, the great Treacle is very forcible, for it strengtheneth the natural heate and the vitall spirits, that it may the more mightier withstand all venime, if one take halfe a dragme thereof with any distilled water. Item, take the confection Diambra, Diamoschu, and Manus Christie with Pearles, likewise halfe a dragme of Lignum Aloes, tempered with two ounces of water of water Lillies, and drunk in the euening when one goeth to bed. There is also highly commended to take oftentimes one scruple of Pearles with one ounce of Basill water. What concerneth the skin. §. 11. WHen as the sking through great vnnaturall heate is annoyed and hurt, which may be perceiued by the corroding and by the sharpe matter, then is the same place to be annointed with the iuice of Lettice, of Purslaine, of water Lillies, and also with vnripe Sallad oyle: but if it be caused through cold, that thereby the vnnaturall heate be extinguished, then is there no better thing than to bath the place with strong red wine warmed. But if the disease of the skin do not import any thing, then is it better that it be bathed with a mild Lye, with Nepe, or garden Mints, and if this corroding do increase, then vse this precious salue ensuing: Take litharge of Gold and Ceruse, of each two ounces, oyle of Roses two ounces and a halfe, the iuice of Rue foure ounces, Starch as much as suffiseth, then stirre it the space of certaine howers in a lea∣den mortar, at last temper one quarter of an ounce of small bruised Camfere amongst it. Of the actuall and potentiall cauterie. §. 12. THese actuall and potentiall cauteries are both of them commended by the Phi∣sitions in the extreamest néede, to wit, vpon the head, and in the necke, and in moe other places, but because it may not be effected without danger of some o∣ther parts (like as also they themselues do acknowledge) therefore we will not write any ampler thereof at this present. If any one be so hardly assailed of the Leprosie, that he be no otherwise to be holpen but by cauterization, he may take ye aduice of those men that haue experience in it. And because that all which we haue hitherto written is more meete for the Elephantiasis, (like as we haue declared at first) notwithstanding it is also good for all species of the Leprosie, therefore followeth hereafter all that which is commodious for all species of this sicknes. What is requisite for euery sort of Leprosie. §. 13. FOr this, hath Treacle the highest commendation; in like sort the confection of Hiera and Hedgehogs flesh (whereof we haue admonished before) whether it be rosted, fryed, or sodden. Also the flesh of the venimous Snake Tyrus is com∣mended by Galen and of other famous Phisitions moe. But because that we (God be praised) haue not this Snake here in this Realme, it is not néedfull for to write much therof, but to speake rather of those things that are to be got∣ten in this countrie, and may do ease, as the powder of burnt Hares one dragme and a halfe, with foure ounces of wine drunke thrée dayes together. Take in like manner as much powder of Squils, or the iuice of the same, with the sirupe of Squils, and then temper halfe a dragme
more or lesse of Assa foetida, with Honie amongst it, and so take it. Item, take powned Comin fiue dragmes, with clarified Honie. There may also be more written, yea a whole booke full of the Leprosie, and how that euery accident of the same is at the beginning to be eased; but if so be that the foresaid remedies will helpe the sicke person, then be the accidents the easier to be holpen: for which we haue also in ma∣ny places written much of the foresaid diseases, which altogether may and ought to be vsed for this, and therewith we will conclude. Of the bad vlcer Cacoëte. §. 14. FOr a conclusion of these corrodings, impostumes and vlcers, we will also briefly write of those which the Grecians do call Cacoete, which is a species of the Canker, and so venimous, that it continueth with a bodie all his life time: for notwithstanding all the counsell which may be done for it, yet is it all in vaine, and it doth remaine incu∣rable, and moreouer (like as is said) is very long continuing: yet do some commend this ensu∣ing for some especiall thing. Take Soldanella halfe a dragme, powdred Rubarbe two scruples, giue the same to drinke of∣tentimes with white wine: when this is taken, then giue to the patient the next day afterward the sirupe of Woormwood and of Cicorie, with Rubarbe, of each one ounce: and so continue euery other day. Afterwards annoint the place of the disease with oyle of Roses, or oyle of sweet Almonds. The fift Chapter. Of outward infections and woundings of the Skin. IN the beginning of this fift Part we haue before declared many things whereby the skinne is infected and annoyed within. Now doth our methode require, that we should write somewhat of the outward accidents of the skinne, which be hurtfull to the same, and also to the flesh vnderneath it, and we will also begin with the least, which is of burning or scalding. Of burning or scalding with fire, hot water, and of burning with Gunpowder. §. 1. IF there be any burnt with fire or scalded with hot water, then haue the things or medicines whereby both these are to be cooled and healed, small difference: but concerning the burning with Gunpowder, of that we will write after ano∣ther manner. Of the burning of fire, or scalding with hot water, there commeth at the first an excessiue paine, and diuers blisters whereout water doth run. Secondly, if one will heale these sores, then is there first to be spread thereon a pap of the powder of Saunders, with Rosewater, and tempered with a litle Camfere, or with the water of Nightshade. Or temper fine Bolus with vineger, with Rosewater, and with water of Nightshade: these things are to be laid vpon it so long, vntill the paine be almost gone. For this may also be vsed the salue of Poplar, mixed with the white of an egge. And if so be that the blisters do not break of themselues, then are they to be opened with a needle, to the end that the flesh next vnderneath be not harmed thereby. This is now a necessarie and common maner of doing, viz. at the first: but what is méete to haue more done in it, that shall hereafter follow. And because that such kind of diseases may be rather healed with salues than otherwhise, therefore will we first of all begin with them.
These things following are to be vsed immediatly after the burning, and vntill the paine be at the extreamest: Take oyle of Roses and vnripe Sallad oyle, of each thrée ounces, white Waxe, washed Litharge of gold, and Ceruse, of each one ounce, Starch three quarters of an ounce; melt the oile and the Waxe together, and then powre it hote vpon cold water: after∣wards wash it three times, and that with Nightshade water: at last temper the other things amongst it. But if you will haue it more drying, then may you mixe powned Cipers nuts a∣mongst it, as many as you please. Item, take Butter, or Swines grease, eight ounces; let it be hote, and powre it vpon cold water: afterwards let it be stiffe againe, and then put it into a dish: stirre it well about, and powre of the water vnto it vntill it be thorow white: at last stirre one ounce and a halfe of Peter oyle in it, and therewith annoint the burning. But if so be that the burning be two or three dayes old, then take of the foresaid salue, and spread it vpon linnen as a plaister, and lay it sixe or seuen times a day vpon it, according to the importance of the burning, for that how much the oftener it is refreshed, so much the better and sooner is the same also to be healed. If so be that the burning be great and deepe, thē do not bind it tight, to the end the heate may passe out the better. Item, Take Butter wherein an egge is baked and burnt, powre it vpon cold water: when it is stiffe, then wash the same eight times with cold water, and at the last twice with vineger: now take two ounces and a halfe of this Butter, put therto the whites of two egs wel brayed, Linseede oile halfe an ounce, then annoint it on the burning. Commonly the oyle of Roses is good for burning, being tempered with salt, Linséede oyle, Inke, and Oxycraton. Item, take oyle of Roses one ounce, thrée yolkes of egs, mixe them well together: you may also adde fower or fiue graines of Saffron vnto it. Another. Take oyle of Roses three ounces, Bolus one dragme, make it verie hote: after∣wards dip a cloth in it, and lay it thereon as hot as the patient can abide it. But if the paine be abating, then is there a salue to be chosen of this Lyme ensuing: Take vnslect Lime, powre water vpon it, but thrust not the hand into it, but stirre it well about with a spoone vntill that it scum: afterwards strike it off with a feather, and temper it with Sallad oile: at last annoint it in the burning: the same is very highly commended. Or take vnslect Lyme, and with Sallad oyle make a salue of it as thicke as pap, and annoint therewith. Item, Take oile of Roses two ounces, vnripe Sallad oyle one ounce & a halfe, white Waxe halfe an ounce, let it séeth a little all together: afterwards powre it on cold water, and wash it therewith. This being done, temper small brused Ceruse amongst it thrée quarters of an ounce, Frankinsence and Sarcocolla, of each one dragme, prepared Lyme half an ounce, Saffron halfe a scruple, washed litharge of gold thrée quarters of an ounce, then temper them all toge∣ther. This following is a well approued salue for burning: Take quicke lyme which is sla∣ked with good wine, let the lyme drie well, and put in as much Linséede oyle vntill it be as it were a dough: afterwards annoint the burning with it, and then lay none other vpon it. But if so be that it waxe drie and hard, then spreade more vpon it and take it not off, for that the burning will be suddenly whole, and when it is healed, then falleth it away of it selfe. This is thus by some to be assured: neuerthelesse it is perillous not to looke to it in long time, for that there might some other thing sticke vnto it. For this is also fit, the oyle of Saint Iohns wort alone or tempered with washed lyme, and so spread vpon the burning, for it cooleth maruellous much. Item, take oile of Roses thrée oun∣ces, white Frankinsence one ounce, Ceruse three ounces, the whites of thrée Egs, Camfer one dragme, make thereof a salue. Another. Take oyle of Oliues foure ounces, powned frankinsence halfe an ounce, the in∣nermost rinds of Elderne one quarter of an ounce: seeth them all together with a little Vineger, vntill that the Vineger be throughly wasted, then straine it thorow a cloth and vse it as before. Item: Take old candle tallow, Goates suet, and Linséed oyle, of each a like quantitie: let them melt together, and put therto the white of Hens dung, as much of the one as of the other things: let it seeth well together, and then straine it through a cloth, afterwards lay it vpon the burnt place, and let it lye thereon a day or twaine: then wash it off with lukewarme water, and lay againe a fresh plaister vpon it.
For this is also good all the white salues which are described in the fourth part, the ninth chapter, and first §. Item, yet another salue which is to be found in the first part, the seuenth chapter, and 17. §. This salue following is also very good for all sorts of burning: Take oyle of Roses two ounces, the yolkes of sixe Egges stamped well together, and temper some Saf∣fron amongst it, afterwards spread it on a cloth and lay it vpon the burning: it healeth very spéedily. Another. Séeth Mustardséede in the creame of milke, then powne it to pappe and wring it through a cloth, afterward annoint therewith the burning. After the same maner is Linséede also to be sodden, strained and vsed. Or take Oaten meale, boyle it in Creame, and vse it as the rest: this is especiall good for scalding with hote water. Item, take the iuice of Rapes or of Onions, each apart, or mixed together, and annoint the burning oftentimes with it, and lay the leaues of the Cherry trée vpon it. Take the iuice of an Onion, and oyle of the kernels of Abricockes halfe an ounce, temper them together. The sirupe of Oxycraton doth coole much the burning. Inke tempered with the water of Carduus Benedictus is much commended for this, if one make a cloth wet therein and lay vpon it. Item, the leaues of Waterlillies layd vpon the burning do coole and also heale. Of the in∣flammation and heate of the vlcers which is caused within, you haue heard before in the second chapter and sixth §. Of burning with Gunne-powder. §. 2. IF any haue a shotten pellet cut out of his bodie, then is this oyle following to be layd vpon it: Take oyle of Elderne flowers twelue ounces, oyle of Saint Iohns wort one ounce, Turpentine halfe an ounce; temper these together, and set them certaine dayes in the sunne: this hath a maruellous efficacie and vertue. Another. Take oyle of Roses, Nightshade water, Rose water, water of Lil∣lies, and oyle of Saint Iohns wort, of each a like quantitie, and wash therewith the wound oftentimes. Item, for to coole the inflammation, take the water of Nightshade and of Saint Iohns wort, of each eight ounces, Allume halfe an ounce, Ceruse, Litharge of siluer, and Verdigrease, of each one dragme, powne them all small together, and temper them well together, and then lay it as warme vpon it as may be suffered thrée or foure times toge∣ther. Or take Linséede oyle, vnsleckt lime, fine Bolus, and Rie meale, of each like quantitie, stirre them well together, and then spread it on the burning: it draweth out the heate and the powder. Item, take good hony eight ounces, let it séeth and be well scummed, then put thereto halfe as much sharpe vineger of Roses, and séeth it all together vntill it be browne: afterwards put a spoonefull of beaten Allume vnto it, and kéepe it well; for the elder it is, so much the bet∣ter it is. There is also prepared for this two kinds of ley; the one which is made of quicke lime, and layd vpon it with a wet cloth; the other is, if one temper strong ley with Sallad oyle, and lay it theron: this ley is very good for al heate, whether it be through burning with gunpowder, or otherwise for all inflammation which doth appeare outwardly. For all scalles of burning. §. 3. TAke Ceruse one ounce and a halfe, Camfer halfe a dragme, Rose water thrée quarters of an ounce, Starch halfe an ounce; bruise it, and temper it well together in a mortar with the white of an egge vnto a thinne salue; spread it thereon and round about the scalles, and they will drie and fall off. Before in the third Chapter and tenth §. you haue yet moe other fit remedies for it.
The sixt Chapter. For to draw Splinters and Thornes out of the skin. IF that any Splinter or Thorne do sticke in the skin, then must one looke to pull out the same immediatly: otherwise it must ranckle out with great paine. Thus for to remedie this: Take Oxe suet, Waxe and Rosin, of each a like quantitie, Pirola, Béetes, Louage, Ladymantle, and Sanicle, ac∣cording to the quantitie of the former: powne them together, and wring out the iuice: afterwards put it amongst the molten Waxe, Rosin, and suet, and then boyle it vntill all the iuice be wasted, and there become a salue of it. Another. Take two parts of Sallad oile, and one part of Rosin, or Turpentine, and as much Waxe, let it melt together, and stirre it well vntill it be cold. For this is also good, the plaister Apostolicon and Gratia Dei, that are described before. Item, the iuice of Barberies tempered with Barley meale, is also good for it. Sief de Thure draweth out the arrowes, like as before is shewed. The rootes of Béetes, of Polipodie, decocted with their leaues and layed thereon, drawe also much. If so be that any body in spinning get a shiue in their finger, then take picked Plantaine leaues, wring out the iuice, and lay it vpon it, it will quickly draw out the shiue that sticketh in the hand, and heale it. The seuenth Chapter. Of wounds and all that concerneth them. AMongst all outward accidents which harme the skin and the parts adia∣cent, are the wounds also to be accounted: for which you haue before (in the common description of vlcers) certaine rules which be also neces∣sary for all wounds, and may be applied vnto them: therefore they are to be added here. In all wounds (whereof soeuer they be caused, whether it be of pric∣king, cutting, shooting, or falling) the Chirurgian must first looke that he cause the bloud to be stanched: but if that be not performed, then doth the patients strength and power weare away, and at last his life also. Therfore will we first of all write and discourse thereof. For to stanch blood. §. 1. TAke Gum of Arabia, and Dragagant, of each one dragme, red Corall, Bloud∣stone, burnt Iuorie and Camfere, of each halfe a dragme, make this powder with water of Plantaine vnto a dough, and lay it vpon the wounds. Some do also temper it with Bolearmoniack and Momy, which is not amisse. Item, take Frankinsence, Masticke, and small cut Hares haire, of each a like quantitie; make a soft salue thereof with the white of an Egge, and lay it vpon the bléeding. Or take Dragon bloud, vnsleckt Lyme and Frankinsence, of each a like quantitie: this are you to vse if there be any great veine perished: but if the great veines be hurt the long way, then vse burnt Coperas with it. Item, Take the white of an Egge, fine Bolus, Dragon bloud, Bloudstone, and Frankin∣sence, of each a like quantitie; make a plaister of it, and then spreade it vpon Tow, and so lay it vpon the wound.
Or stampe Peach kernels, and make a plaister of it with the white of an egge. Item take yellow Rose seed, powne it to powder, and temper Vineger therewith vnto a pap, and so lay it vpon the bléeding wound, it will stop it. Resolue Coperas in Vineger, and set it certaine dayes in the hote sunne, or let it séeth, after∣wards wet a cloth therein, and so lay it vpon it. The parings of Parchment boyled to Lime, and laid vpon it, are also very forcible for to staunch bloud. Burne a hat to ashes and strew it into the wound. Dryed swines dung powned to powder, doth also staunch bloud. Item take Egshels, and lay it so long in strong Vineger to stéepe, vntill that they be very soft, and then let them be hard againe: afterwards powne them small, and vse them as the other. Mans haire also burnt, and beaten to powder, stauncheth much the bleeding at the nose, and all other manner of bléeding. The iuice of Shepheards purse stauncheth and cooleth all hote bloud. In May are you to take Comfrey with the leaues, and shred it small; this being done, distill it like other water, and drop in the wound. The same do the Chirurgians ascribe to Maiden milke, which is in the first part, the fift chapter and 1. §. described. Item, for to staunch the bloud at the nose, hold vpon the forehead a cold flint stone, bloud stone, Calcedonie or Carnoyle stones, or put in his hand the rootes of Corne roses: a man is to hang his priuities in strong vineger, or a cloth wet therein and laid thereon, the bléeding will cease immediatly. For to staunch the bloud you may also looke into these places following, as of the bléeding of the Eares in the first part, the 9. chapter, and 4. §. of the bléeding of the gums, in the first part, the 17. chapter, and 7. §. Item, of spetting of bloud, in the second part, 5. Chapter and 11. §. to staunch the bléeding of the Hemorrhoides, in the third part, the 9. chapter, and 4. §. of pissing bloud, in the third part, the 16. chapter, and 11. §. and of womens tearmes in the 3. part, the 19. chapter, and 3. §. Of the clotted bloud in the body. §. 2. IF so be that a wounded man, or one that hath taken a fall, hapned to bléed in∣ward, then are all meanes to be sought to expell the same with all spéede: for otherwise it must inwardly corrupt and putrifie, whereby very perillous agues and other deadly diseases might ingender, whereof in the second part, the fift chapter, and 17. §. (of the spetting bloud) is sufficiently written. The common people do aduise, that in this disease one is to drinke his owne vrine, whereby the clotted bloud should be expelled. The same doth also the wine of Harts toung, and all other vulnerall potions which hereafter shall be described. This plaister following is much commended: Take Goates milke and Honie, as much as you please, let it be very warme together, and stir fine Bolus therein vntill it be a salue, and bind that vpon it, whereby the congealed and clotted bloud will be expelled. Of the stitching of wounds. §. 3. THis stitching of the wounds is committed to the Chirurgians charge, accor∣ding to the importance of the cause: but I will onely adde this vnto it, and speake of those things that do heale the wounds together without stitching: Take Masticke and Dragonbloud, of each one quarter of an ounce, Frankin∣sence one drag. Mill dust and Beane meale, of each one ounce and a halfe; make them all to powder, and temper them with the brayed whites of Egs and Rose water, vnto a pap. Afterwards spread it vpon two long clouts which be somewhat strong, and that are as long as the wound is, & lay one vpon each side of the wound, vpon the whole flesh: this being dry, then few the wound so close together, as you please, the néedle not going tho∣rough the skin, but thorough the clouts onely. The golden salue (is also much commended) called Ʋnguentum Aureum Mesuae, which is made thus: Take yellow Waxe 3. ounc. Sallad oile 12. ounc. Turpentine one ounce, Rofin & Colofonie of each one quarter of an ounce, Frankinsence & Mastick of ech half an ounce, Saffrō
a drag. let the Waxe, Turpentine, and oyle melt together, and afterwards put the Rosen vnto it: and when it beginneth to be cold, then temper amongst it the Masticke, Frankinsence, and Saffron: this ioyneth the wounds together, and healeth them. In the first Part, the 7. chap. and 10. §. there haue you a water described, beginning thus: Take Litharge of siluer, &c. which is ve∣ry much renowned for this purpose. In like sort M. Tristrams water, and other golden waters, with foure kinds of Balmes which are to be found in the last part. Of fresh wounds. §. 4. THese forementioned things be verily the chiefest, which may be vsed without any de∣lay for all fresh wounds. When as now the bloud is staunched, and all finished that is néedfull to be done, then are these things ensuing cōmended highly: First, M. Tri∣strams water is thought meete to heale all fresh wounds, which may also be done with all golden waters, whether it be that one take them inward, or lay them outwardly vpon them. The oyle of Tyles should not onely heale, but also preserue the wounds frō all putrified flesh; this is also ascribed to the oyle of Linnen. The oyle of S. Iohns wort is also much com∣mended, and the oyle of Roses; for that they haue an astringent vertue and efficacie. Likewise the oyle of Spike, and oyle of Lead. It is also streightly commaunded, that all new wounds shall be washed with Wormwood or with Rosemarie: for that both these keep the fresh wounds cleane, and faire from all putrifaction, and are also healing. But if any one be but a little wounded, so that it be not néedfull to go to a Chirurgian with it, then vse this salue following: Take Turpentine which is thrée times washed in wine, and stirre the yolke of an egge amongst it, Barly meale one quarter of an ounce, Saffron 5. grains; temper them together: This salue is good for all paine, although it be also in a finewie part: it maketh flesh spéedily to grow. It is also not vnlike to Vnguento Mundificatiuo. This plaister fol∣lowing will heale the wound in 20. daies, without matter and without paine: Take Waxe half an ounce, white Coral 3. drag. Colofonia & Momy, of each 7. drag Myrrhe 2. drag. Camfere, Loadstone, of each half a drag. oyle of Egs as much as is néedful for to mixe amongst al the rest. This salue is thus to be vsed, if any one be cut or thrust, & if this plaister be laid vpon it within 4. howers, then shall the wound within 20. daies without any corruption or any other addi∣tion be healed. If so be that then it be a thrust that goeth quite thorough, then is one to haue 4. plaisters in a readines, and to lay 2. vpon it before noone, and 2. at after noone, without putting any thing else vnto it. But if so be that it be but a wound, then are two enough: to the end that there remaine no clotted bloud within, is this powder following to be giuen to the patient; take Mommy one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus and Dragon bloud, of each one dragm, giue thereof to the patient euening and morning, the quantitie of an Hasell nut. Many kinds of vulnerall potions. §. 5. EVery Chirurgian will shew his cunning in this; for each one hath a seuerall potion which he kéepeth as a secretum secretorum. Also it is indéed of great importance, when as the inward parts be perished, or if there be any bloud inwardly congealed, it can in no better way be holpen than by this meanes: wherefore we haue here rehearsed certaine of these vulneral potions, whereof the Chirurgians do much estéem. Take wild Béets (which is Pirola) with their rootes one M. Consolida saracenica, the roots 2. M. Mugwoort without rts 4. M. and powre thereto one quart of wine in a new leaded pot: then stop it tight, to the and there flie no vapor out: afterwards let it séeth together by a small fire, vntill about the third part be consumed, drink therof morning & euening, according as the disease is great, and accor∣ding as the body is hot or cold, take strong or small wine. But in winter when ye herbs be dry, then take one ounce of Mugwoort, Consolida saracenica half an ounce, wild Beets 2. drag. & seeth it as before in a quart of wine: this is an approued potion for all vlcers, wounds, and all other diseases, being vsed inwardly, and also outwardly. This plaister following is also to be vsed with it: Take clarified Honie 8. ounces, wheate flower 2. ounces, Linséed oyle three ounces, fine Bolus one ounce and a halfe, then make thereof a plaister, and lay it thereon. Item, take Conso∣lida saracenica with yellow flowers, Mugwoort, wild Béetes, and Ladimantle, of each one M. h all together in a quart of wine, whether it be Malmsey, or any other good wine. This po∣tion hath bene approued oftentimes, and was found very good.
Another: Take wild Béetes, wild Tansie, Sanicle, and Agrimonie, being all gathered at a full Moone, dried in the ayre, and then stamped to powder: when as you will vse thereof, then take an earthen pot which will hold a quart of moisture, and put therein of this foresaid powder, as much as you can gripe at two or thrée times betweene your two fingers, and accor∣ding as the wound requireth: afterwards powre vnto it a pint of wine, and couer the pot very tight with a slice of bread, then let it stand the space of a good howre in a warm place vntill it be cold, and giue thereof to the wounded person twice a day. You may also strew of this powder in the wounds. Yet another: Take Consolida saracenica, Agrimonie, wild Tansie, Mugwoort, Cicorie, Southernwood, and wild Béetes, of each a like quantitie, drie the herbes in ye shadow and then stampe them to powder: afterwards take a quart of wine, and put therto an ounce of this powder, then séeth it in hote water, vntill the breadth of thrée or foure fingers be consu∣med: afterwards put thereto a spoonefull of Asarabacca powned small, and giue thereof to the patient when he goeth to bed thrée or foure ounces at one time. Another: Take Sanicle, A∣uence, Agrimonie, Buglosse, Verueine, Cicorie flowers, Consolida saracenica, Betonie, Hysop, Sage, Mugwoort, wild Tansie, wild Béetes, and S. Iohns wort, of each a like quantitie: séeth them all together in wine, and giue the patient thereof twice a day, at each time thrée or foure spoonefuls. Item, take Consolida saracenica, Agrimonie, Sanicle, wild Tansie, Plantaine, and Béetes, of each a like quantitie, let it séeth together in wine, and giue thereof warme. Diuers such like potions are described in the third part, the third Chapter of the fractures of bones. Of the Plaisters for thrusts and wounds. §. 6. FIrst, to write of the Plaisters for thrusts, there be many kinds prepared for it, as hereafter followeth: Take Waxe one ounce and a halfe, Colofonie and Mo∣mie, of each two ounces, Frankinsence one ounce, Camfere one ounce and a quarter, bruse it small, and afterwards melt the Waxe and the Colofonie, tem∣per then the rest amongst it, and worke it woll together, annointing the hands with oyle of Egges. Another which is approued: Take Turpentine foure ounces, Colofonie and Rosin, of each two ounces, white Cadmia one ounce, Loadstone one ounce, Frankinsence two ounces, Masticke and Momie, of each halfe an ounce, Iuniper oyle one quarter of an ounce, oyle of Egges, and Camfere, of each halfe an ounce, dissolue the Gumme in Wine or Vineger, and straine it through a cloth into a pan, afterwards let it seeth together, then put thereto the Cadmia and Ceruse: when it hath sodden well, then put the Loadstone vnto it, and let it wale once againe: afterwards adde the Frankinsence, Masticke, and the Mummie vnto it. This being done, let it séeth a little more, and when it is waxen lukewarme, then put the Camfere well brused vnto it, and then worke it further well together vnto a plaister. Item, take Waxe, Rosin, Turpentine, oyle of Egs, and Sallad oile of each foure ounces, oyle of Roses one ounce, séeth it all together vnto a plaister, and then at last put vnto it one dragme of Camfere: but if it be too hard, make it softer with oyle of Roses. Another: Take Waxe & Colofonie, of each one ounce, Momie one quarter of an ounce, Frankinsence, Myrrhe, and Masticke, of each half an ounce, white Corall thrée dragmes, Loadstone one dragme, white Cadmia one quarter of an ounce, Dragon bloud one dragme, Camfere one ounce, make thereof a plaister. For this, is also very good the plaister of Maister Flackenstone, which is described in the second Chapter, and the 1. §. Item, take Waxe two ounces, Turpentine, and Gummi Ho∣leni, of each one ounce, Dragon bloud, and Hartwoort, of each halfe an ounce, Gummi Ammo∣niacum one ounce, Ceruse one ounce and a halfe, Frankinsence, Momie, Masticke, and Iuniper berries, of each one ounce, Allume one ounce and a halfe, make a plaister thereof.

This being done, let it seeth softly, stirring it round about, at last temper the Camfers with foure spoonefuls of the oyle of Iuniper amongst it. Item, take oyle of Roses and Waxe, of each foure ounces, Déere sewet two ounces, Fran∣kinsence and Myrrhe, of each half an ounce, Galbanum, Mastick, and Turpentine, of each half an
ounce, make a plaister of it. This ensuing is not onely good for wounds, but also for all vlcers: Take Turpentine and Waxe, of each foure ounces, Mastick two ounces, Rose leaues 16. oun∣ces, browne Betony, the greater Pimpernell, spiked Plantaine, Nightshade, Diuels bit, Ver∣ueine, and Storkes bill, of each eight ounces, adde a quart of wine vnto it; seeth first therin the Roses alone: this being done, powre it through a cloth, and wring out the iuice well: after∣wards take the other herbs, and put them also into a kettle, with two quarts of Wine, after∣wards let them séeth together euen to the halfe, then wring it well out, and let the decoction be very hote that the Waxe may melt in it, then put the Rose wine with the Mastick also vnto it, then séeth it to a plaister, and worke it very strongly with the hands, but you must first annoint them with Butter, This foresaid plaister is not onely good for wounds, but also for all vlcers. Also you haue in the first Chapter and 15. §. many things which are also very méete for to cure the wounds. The Chirurgians haue yet a blacke plaister nivse, which is made thus: Take Frankinsence halfe an ounce, Momie halfe an ounce, Colofonie three quarters of an ounce, oyle of Egs halfe an ounce, Camfere one dragme, white Waxe thrée dragmes: melt the Waxe and the oyle of Egs with the powned Colofony, and then temper the other things powned amongst it.

Item, take clarified Honie eight ounces, fine meale two ounces, Linseede oyle thrée ounces, fine Bolus one ounce and a halfe, make a pla∣ster thereof, and lay it vpon the wounds: for this also is requisit the plaister Gratia Dei. Vulnerall Salues. §. 7. THere be also many kinds of vulnerall Salues prepared,Vnguentum Fuscum. amongst which this ensuing is one of the principallest, which is called Ʋnguentum Fuscum, and is made thus: Take oyle of Violets nine ounces, Waxe two ounces, Colofonie one ounce, plume Allume thrée quarters of an ounce, Pitch, Sagapenum, and Gummi Arabicum of each one ounce, Mastick, Galbanum, Ammoniacum, Bdellium, Opopanacum, Frankinsence and Turpentine, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, the oyle of Violets and Waxe are you to melt, and to let it séeth thoroughly: afterwards tem∣per the Pitch and the Colofonie with the dissolued gums amongst it, and when it beginneth to be cold, then mixe the rest with it. This salue is somewhat attractiue, cleansing, and also hea∣ing. This ensuing is said to heale all wounds: Take Turpentine thrée ounces, Waxe seuen dragmes, oyle of Cammomill, and oyle of Roses, of each one ounce and quarter, Frankinsence and Mastick, of each one ounce, Myrrhe and Rosin, of each halfe an ounce, good red wine and vineger, of each thrée quarters of an ounce: let the gum be stéeped the space of 24. howers in the vineger and wine, afterwards melt it vpon the fire with the waxe and oyle, then let them séeth vntill the wine be almost all wasted, when it beginneth to be cold, then temper the rest amongst it, and worke this salue with your hands, yet the same being first annointed with oyle of Ma∣stick. This salue cleanseth all wounds, it causeth the flesh to grow, and healeth also very much. Another, which is also very good: Take Louage, Bistorta, Sage, Plantaine, Yarrow, Elecam∣pane leaues, wild Tansie, Sanicle, Cinquefoile, wild Béets, Mallowes, Betonie, Agrimony, Verueine, and Consolida saracenica, of each a like quantitie: shred all these herbes, and then put sufficient swéet Butter vnto it; afterwards stamp all these herbs together, and let them so stand certaine dayes. This being done, make it afterwards warme, and presse it out hard, and then let it séeth so long together vntill the iuice of all the herbes be consumed, then put vnto it Oxe et, Harts suet, Buckes suet, the marrow of an Oxe, Waxe, Rosin, and Turpentine, of each a like quantitie, according to the quantitie of the Butter, and afterwards melt them all toge∣ther: when it beginneth to be cold, then put vnto it Frankinsence, Myrrhe, Fenegréeke meale, Allume, Verdigrease, and Masticke being beaten small all together, then stirre it much toge∣ther. Another which is briefer: Take Oxe suet, Harts suet, Waxe, Turpentine, Hony, Lo∣age, Violets, Betony, Agrimonie, and wild Tansie, of each as much as you please, stamp the herbes, and wring out the iuice, afterwards séeth it in the suets vntill it be as thick as a salue. Item, take Rue, Sulphur, Chamaeleon niger, of each a like quantitie, and Oxe suet, as much as will suffise for to make a salue.
For to draw matter out of the wounds. §. 8. TAke Waxe one ounce and a halfe, Rosin thrée quarters of an ounce, Harts suet one ounce, Turpentine and Sallad oyle, as much as is néedfull for to make a salue or plaister: or take clarified Honie, and Turpentine washed with wine, of each halfe an ounce, oyle of Roses two ounces, let it séeth together vntill it be thicke. This cleanseth the wounds of all kind of matter, and withstandeth all affluxions. But if there be any heate with, then take in stead of common Hony, Honie of Ro∣ses, but temper not the same with it vntill the other be first boyled. Of the Taints. §. 9. IF you thinke that the wounds will heale too soone, then cut a drie roote of Gentian for a taint as big as you please, and vse the same in stead of a taint: for when the same waxeth moist, then doth it swell, and holdeth open the wounds as long as you please, and it is very holesome of it selfe. Annoint also the taint with the salue Apo∣stolorum, or Aegyptiacum, which be both very méete to kéepe open all wounds and vlcers, and also to cleanse them. For foule flesh. §. 10. NOw these two be contrarie: of the first mentioned salue the plaister Gratia Dei letteth no foule flesh grow in the wound; so also doth the oyle of Tyles. Item, take burnt Allume, and fine Bolus, of each a like quantitie, and strew it therein. Or take Verdigrease, and Trociskes de Chelidonia, of each a like quantitie; make a powder thereof and strew it therein. For this is also very meete, burnt Harts bones two parts, Salt one part, and vse them as before. Take the iuice of Narcissus, of Plantaine, and garden Mints, and the iuice of Rue: all these iuices or those that you can get may you take and vse. Item, burne Birchen rinds to powder, and temper it with burnt Al∣lume, or vse each alone. If so be that then there grow any wormes in the wounds, then tem∣per the iuice of Rue with Vineger and drop it therein. To staunch the Synouia.. §. 11. TAke the white of an Egge and put a little Saffron amongst, afterwards beate them well together with a péece of powned Allume the bignesse of a Hasell nut, and lay it vpon the place whence the Synouia issueth. Another: Take the white of an Egge, and mingle therewith Allume, and Salt, of each one dragme beaten small, and then vse it as the other. Item, burne Lentils to powder and strew it therein: afterwards take Turpentine and Sal∣lad oyle, let them heate together, and then mixe therein the burnt Lentils vnto a salue or plai∣ster: or take Hempseede, powne it vntill it yéeld oyle, afterwards lay it in a fine cloth ouer the disease and bind it vnto it. Item: take the water of the greater Pimpernell and drop it there∣in. Item: take Strawberrie leaues, and apply them vnto the place. Or take the fruite of Ro∣ses, drie them, stampe them to powder and strew it therein. When a wounded member is lamed. §. 12. FOr this do the Chirurgians vse this ensuing: Take Cow dung and Goates dung, make a plaister of it with the oyle of Earthwormes, and so lay it warme vnto it: by this meanes do the shrunken sinewes waxe loose. But looke in the fourth part the seuenth chap. and 2. §. what is written of the lamenesse and extenuation of the mem∣bers. The like also in the 3. chap. of the Pocks where you shal find good direction of this matter.
To cause the flesh to grow in wounds. §. 13. THe Grecians and the Phisitions do call the things which cause the flesh to grow Sarcotica, which be for the most part drie in the first degrée: for if they be ouermuch drying, then will they not onely drie the humors which do fall into the wounds, but the bloud also, and the whole substance of the part. This salue following is very requisite for it: Take Hony sixe ounces seeth and skum the same vntill it be a litle thicke; afterwards temper therein Myrrhe, Sarco∣colla, and Aloe, of each one dragme and a halfe, powned all together to powder. Item, take the Lytharge of siluer, refuse of Iron, Centorie, Aloe, Frankinsence, and Masticke, of each a like quantitie, make a subtill powder of it. For this is also méete the plaister Album coctum, Triaphar∣macon, and Apostolicon, which all together ingender flesh, and are prescribed for the same intent. For this also be these plaisters following to be vsed, viz. Emplastrum griseum, or de lapide Calami∣nari, which is thus made: Take prepared Calaminari half an ounce, Lytharge of gold one ounce Ceruse one quarter of an ounce, Tuty halfe a dragm, Masticke one dragme and a half, Myrrhe one dragme, Camfer two scruples, make thereof a plaister; if it be too hard, put more Turpen∣tine vnto it: this plaister drieth, causeth flesh to grow, healeth and cicatriseth all wounds. The other: Take prepared Calaminari foure ounces, Masticke, Frankinsence, and Dragagant, of each one dragme, the Lytharge of siluer halfe an ounce, Waxe thrée quarters of an ounce, Rosin halfe an ounce, prepared Tuty two scruples, and oyle of Roses, as much as is néedfull, this is somewhat weaker than the other. The salue of Tuty, Diapampholigos, is very meete for this vse, so is also the salue Apostolorum. Of that which causeth the Skin to grow. §. 14. AT last if you perceiue that the flesh is growne so high, that there wanteth only cicatrisation, then are things to be vsed which haue an astringent vertue, and which do drie excéedingly without corrosion. For which be most fit all the salues of lime which be described in the fift Chapter, and first §. In like manner also the fiue white salues which be discouered in the ninth Chapter, and first §. and the last mentioned Diapampholigos. This powder following is excéeding good for it: Take Lytharge of siluer, burnt Allume, washed Lyme, burnt Lead, Gals, and Pom∣granate peeles, of each a like quantitie, strew it vpon the wound: for this also it is very fit that the wounds be washed with Wormwood wine, or Rosemarie wine. Concerning the wounds of the head we haue written somewhat in the description of the skull in the first part, the fourth chapter, and 1. §. The eight Chapter. Of the Cicatrices and spots of the Skin. WHen there hath bene any bodie wounded, or hath had some other exulce∣ration healed, then will there remain on the same place some cicatrice or mark. For as hath bene admonished at the first the skin doth neuer more heale of it selfe, but there must grow a new skin. Also it happeneth other∣whiles that newborne children do bring spots into the world. And be∣cause that the same are placed in the face they do make a great deformi∣tie: therefore we will also discourse of them. Amongst the Grecians be those spots that be white called Leuce, and by the Latinists Ʋitiligines, which be white spots of the bodie. Item, there be also blacke spots of the Leprosie. Of the spots which appeare in the face we haue written in the first part, the fift Chapter, and first §. which remedies may also be vsed ouer the whole bodie. But because there be so many kind of sorts we are to write the more at large of them.
Of the moles or markes that children are borne withall. §. 1. IT hapneth also many times, that newborne children do bring with them into the world certaine spots or moles, which are caused by some frighting, strange lusts, and such like, which women (being with Child) may get, as by experience hath oftentimes bene séene. Chew in the morning fasting Mustard séede, and annoint therewith the spots, do this oftentimes, then will the spots weare a∣way: but looke diligently vnto it, that it come not into the childs eyes: also breath not into his eyes. There come also otherwhiles certaine markes and other red spots on the skin, for which, the Basilica is first to be opened, and afterwards some cooling sirupes, and other cooling potions, but we will write and discourse seuerally thereof. Of red spots through heate. §. 2. OF these spots we haue before admonished in the first Chapter, and 4. §. that all that may be vsed for it which is ordained for the Rose, or Erisipelas. But if so be that this be caused through some vncleannes of the bloud (as it commonly hap∣neth) and that notwithstanding there be no speciall heate instant, then can no better thing be vsed for it than the sirupe of Fumitorie, and al that may be made of that herbe; for that herbe hath an especiall vertue to cleanse the bloud, and to take away all itch of the skin. Afterwards are you to vse this salue following: Take vnsleckt lyme, and prepared Tuly, of each one drag. oyle of S. Iohns woort two ounces; and a litle wax, temper them all together. Or take Camfere, & bruse it with an Almond, then temper the same with Rose water, and annoint the spots therewith. Take oyle of Egs as much as you please, and temper amongst it a good part of brused lytharge of siluer, then annoint therewith the spots this driueth them away how lothsome soeuer they be. For this, is also very fit the oyle of Iuniper, and the oyle of bitter Almonds, and of each a∣like, or each apart. Also you may vse for this maydens milke, Lac virginis, which is described in the first part, the fifth Chapter, and 1. §. Item, take Hellebore two ounces, stampe it to pap, and put thereto as much of the iuice of Agrimonie, and a litle Rosewater, then rubbe the spots with it. Or take lytharge of siluer, burnt Allume, burnt Lead, washed Lyme, Gals, and Pom∣granate blossomes, of each one dragme, and make a powder thereof. Of spots which come by fals. §. 3. BEfore in the first Chapter and 6. §. is a salue described, beginning thus: Take the caules of Goats, &c. which is especiall good for all spots, and very safe. Of spots by stripes or falles. §. 4. FOr this, you haue in the first part, the fifth Chapter and 5. §. two good reme∣dies, without which, you may vse these ensuing, which may be rather vsed vpon the whole bodie than in the face, because that Orpiment is somwhat ve∣nimous: Take the iuice of Marioram gentle two ounces, Orpiment halfe a dragme, oyle of Cammomill one ounce, make a salue thereof. Item, take Wormwood thrée handfuls, Asarabacca, and Plantaine, of each two handfuls, Saltpeter, and wild yellow Rape séede, of each one dragme, Comin, and Sulfur vife powned small, of each thrée dragmes, Saffron one dragme, two well brayed yolkes of Egs make a pla∣ster of it with the iuice of Solidago media, vntill it be decocted hard enough. But if the foresaid spots be without heate, then are to be vsed for it all kinds of fat of beasts, and of all fowls, or the plaister Diachilon, molten amongst it, and so vsed. Item, take fresh Butter, and the decoction of Mallowes: temper the gals of Capons with the white of an egge, and vse it as the other. In the fourth part, the seuenth Chapter, and 3. §. is a salue beginning thus: Take Sage, and Mal∣lowes,
&c. which is also very good for all kind of spots. These things following be also much commended; as the oyle of bitter Almonds, of Iuniper, Citrons salue, the fatnesse of an Asses necke, and M. Tristrams water. And to conclude, we will describe a strong salue, which taketh away all spots, and softeneth all hard swellings, and doth also consume the same. Take the rootes of wild Cucumbers, ye roots of white Behen, the Lytharge of gold, and Argall of each one drag. and a halfe, Sagapenum, and Pigeon dung of each one scrup. oyle of Sesamum thrée ounces, oyle of Iuniper, & oile of wheate, of each two ounces and a halfe, white Waxe one ounce and a halfe, séeth them together in foure ounces of the iuice of Oranges, vntill that all the iuice be spent: take afterwards the white of an Egge, small brused Camfere one dragme, Vineger twelue ounces, wash the rest with it, af∣ter that all is well tempered together: and afterwards vse this salue. The ninth Chapter. Of inward things which spread themselues ouer all the body. WE haue taught before of all outward accidents, which outwardly do in∣fect the skin: but now will we write of those things and parts which are spread within through ye whole bodie, which hold the same together, vn∣derprop it, and sustaine the bodie vpright: these are the bones, veines, and arteries, with ye bloud that is in them, and all that concerneth them; how the same is to be cleansed, and when it runneth ouermuch, how it shall be stopped; how it shall be letten out, and his naturall heate coo∣led. There shall also be discoursed of the sweate, as a superfluitie of all humors. Afterwards we shall discourse of the sinewes, of the tendons and ligaments. Item, of the flesh, and chiefly of that which we do call the muscles. For asmuch as wearisomnesse, fatnesse, leannesse, sléepe, paine, Phlegma, or slime, with many other cold diseases, as well as the bloud, Cholera and Melancholia, may be dispersed in the whole bodie, and that the bloud hath no certaine place in the bodie, as the Cholera in the bladder of the gall, and Melancholia in the milt: (of which two hath bene written in other places) therfore we must not pretermit to write of the nature of Phlegma, and must first begin of the bones. Of the bones. §. 1. THe bones of the whole bodie, be (as it were) the foundation and stay of the body, and also the hardest parts which be in it. These are engendred of the heate of the bodie, which dryeth the moisture, and hardeneth the bones. Plato supposeth that their be∣ginning is of the marrow, which should be so dried away, and hardened through heate: wherefore Empedocles doth ascribe the most part of them to Ʋulcano, that is, the fire. By nature they be drie, earthie, cold, hard, without bloud, and also without féeling. They do get their beginning of the vppermost part of the backe bone, which stretcheth it selfe euen to the thighes. They be also hard knit together, and bounden through the sinewes and ligaments, that there is not one amongst 248. (or as Albertus reckoneth, amongst 276.) that are in mans bodie, the which is not fastened to another bone. When these bones be broken, then do they not grow together againe in their owne substance, but by a certaine liquor, which the Greci∣ans do call Poros, the which hardeneth there so sore, that therewith the whole fracture grow∣eth together againe. But whensoeuer that these bones do breake, or get any other disease, then ke what we haue written thereof in the fourth part, the ninth chap. and 2. §. Of Napta. §. 2. IT happeneth also sometimes that in certaine places of the bodie such a matter is gathered, that doth so harden and grow out of some bone, that it séemeth to be a right bone, which in Latine is called Napta, and although this ought to be cu∣red by chirurgerie, we will neuerthelesse ordaine this for it: Take Frankinsence
one ounce, Mastick fiue drag. Ceruse thrée quarters of an ounce, quicksiluer half an ounce; tem∣per them all together with foure ounces of Swines grease, and rub therwith the Napta, at the fire very hard, not regarding what paine soeuer it doth. The tenth Chapter. Of three kinds of Veines in generall. THe Veines are described by Galen in this manner: The Veines (saith he) are a fat of the bloud, tempered and mixed of bloud and naturall spirits, moist and warme, with great sensibilitie. And vnder this name are com∣prehended three sorts: to wit, bloud veines (called by the Latinists Venae) Arteries and pulse veines, Arteriae, or Venae pulsatiles, for that they beate continually. Secondly, the nature of these veines is warme and moist: what dif∣ference there is betwéene both these sorts of veines, besides the beating, that shall appeare in this description following: the Anatomists do accompt 365. veines in a mans bodie. Thirdly, there be sinewes, which be also comprehended vnder the name of veins, which haue no fellowship at all with ye bloud veins, but only that they do lie spread ouer all ye body, wherof in case that one lose her motion and féeling, then will forthwith the whole bodie, or some part of it (according to the qualitie of the disease) be without might, and depriued of all motion. Of the bloud veines. §. 1. NOw for to describe these thrée sorts of veines, we wil first of all admonish of the bloud veines, which are called of the Phisitions and Anatomists Quietae, which are still veins, and that by reason they be naturally quiet and without motion; for when they be moued, that is done by some outward cause. Albertus and Aristoteles would maintaine and defend against Galenus, that these veins did take their ofspring from the hart: But according to the opinion of Galen and Hippocrates, haue they their beginning in the Lyuer, which question we will leaue to the Anatomists to be decided. But we will shew here in briefe what hath moued Hippocrates to ascribe the beginning of these veines vnto the Lyuer, viz. for that in all creatures (which haue bloud) there is no greater veine than the Lyuer veine, which appeareth none otherwise but as the body of a trée, which is thickest beneath in the ground, and at his beginning, and be∣sides his roote stretching foorth wide and broad, and the branches aboue do spread themselues againe in many sprigs or twigs. And thus it is also with the arteries, wherefore the foresaid authors haue also affirmed, that the Lyuer is none other thing but like to a root and fountaine of all other veines, so that she doth impart her bloud first of all to the heart, as to the most noble part of the bodie. This is now sufficiently spoken in generall of the bloud veines, whereof we will speake and discourse more at large hereafter. Of the Arteries. §. 2. WHereof Galen writeth thus: the Arteries are vessels of the thin and clean bloud, wherein are more naturall spirits or ayre, more heate, drith, and féeling, than in the bloud veines, which remaine alwaies panting and beating. They haue their ofspring of the left concauitie of ye hart, and the first branch a little off from his roote is parted in twaine, whereof the one part goeth vp∣wards, and the other downewards, where (in both places) the foresaid bloud∣veines are spread abroad, with diuers small veins, so that there be few arteries without veins. This altogether is most diligently described by Aristotle, Galen, Albert, and also of Walter Rijf, and at last with liuely figures it is apparant to the eyes. These arteries or pulse veines be by nature (as is said) much hotter, drier, thicker, sensiblier,
and harder, than the bloud veines: Partly like vnto the nature of the sinewes they also receiue some bloud, but it is subtiller and fairer than the bloud of the veines: they be also much more replenished with vitall spirits than the veines, which is also a cause of their continuall panting and mouing, which hapneth so forcible, that the same is outwardly felt ouer the whole bodie, and especially on the hands, féet, temples of the head, and on other places me may be séene and felt. All Phisitions may déeme thereby, whether the nature be strong or feeble, and all accor∣ding as the pulse beateth, swift, slow, hard, soft, steddie, or very trembling. The auncient Phisitions haue bene of opinion, that both these sorts of veines, and especially the arteries (if they be cut or chopt off) could not be consolidated againe, yea that the heart veines be vtterly incurable. But Galenus acknowledgeth verily that the same could hardly be effected in men that be old, but in young people otherwise. Of women and young children doth he admonish that one should not be discouraged; for that he had (saith he) healed inough him∣selfe that were wounded after that manner. For this be also before many good remedies in the second part, the fift Chapter, and 18. §. if a veine be broken in the breast or any other place, which may also be vsed inwardly and outwardly for this purpose. In like manner you may also vse for it this confection insuing: Take Henbane séede, and white Poppie séedes, of each one ounce and a quarter, Sealed earth, and red Corall, of each fiue dragmes, old conserue of Roses, the older the better, foure ounces: temper all together, and take thereof in the morning and euening each time halfe a dragme and no more: this is very good and also forcible for all kinds of bléeding. When as now the veines do swell be it of whatsoe∣uer cause it will, then annoint them with Treacle or Mithridate. Of the Bloud. §. 3. IT is sufficiently knowne that mans bodie is ioyned together of foure kinds of hu∣mors or complexions: to wit, of Bloud, Cholera, Melancholia, and Phlegma; but a∣mongst these is the bloud one of the best, partly, for that it is the matter of the vitall spirits, wherein life it selfe hath his being, or for that it is to be compared with the beginning of life, because it is by nature warme and moist: or because it hath more vertue to nourish and to sustaine, than any of the other humors. In fine, it is such a Iewell of nature; that if the same be taken away, then death doth ensue. Cholera and Melancholia haue their proper places or residences in the bodie, wherein they do gather themselues, as we haue of late declared, from which places they do also shew their po∣wer in the ingendring of sicknesses. But the bloud and Phlegma are so diuided into two parts of the bodie, that one cannot so soone pon the skin in any place, but immediatly the bloud doth issue foorth, and that the veins be ye vessels and habitation of the bloud, hath bene declared before; without the which there can also no bloud be found, except in the least concauitie of the heart. Wherefore Albertus hath bene of none other opinion, but that the veines do begin there, and not in the liuer. The nature of the bloud is hot and moist; yea so hot, that in the whole bodie there is nothing otten and to the contrarie nothing colder than the Phlegma. Therefore this hote and moist bloud is giuen to all liuing creatures, not onely for a nourish∣ment of all members of the bodie, but also to maintaine them by their naturall warmth, and no otherwise. For example good wood is laid vpon the fire for to warme a whole chamber with it; in like sort also, as the fire is abated and his burning taken away, if the same be ouercharged with too much wood, or if the wood be too moist: also if the wood be pluckt away, or too litle laid vpon it: so is it with the heate of the heart, that if the same be too much, or too litle: likewise ouer∣old, vnmeasurable hote, or is too féeble. When the heart shall féele these kind of diseases, then will all other members of the bodie be partakers thereof. It is also the opinion and censure of all learned, that the bloud is the most principal meanes in the mothers bodie, whereby the heart as the chiefe part of the bodie, hath his beginning. Concerning his nature and propertie, then is this not a small miracle of nature, that it hath n féeling of it selfe: neuerthelesse it is cause of the same and of life also. And it is found by daily experience, that if there run much bloud from any creature, that therby come swounings, yea ye
life it selfe runneth out with the bloud. Neither is the bloud alike in all men, nor in all members, it getteth also through age many kinds of nature. In children it is thin and waterish, in youth hote and sharpe, in men at the ful∣lest and best of all, and in all these aforesaid, very much and abundant. In age there is but little, thicke and blacke, and clotting very sodeinly as well inwardly as outwardly vpon the bodie. In like maner it is also sure, that how fatter a body is, so much lesse bloud hath he, for that it is through ye fatnes consumed, as is séene, that all fat hath no bloud in it. Contrarily, how much the leaner, so much the blacker is the bloud. Besides these is also womens bloud much grosser & blacker than mens bloud, & women haue also lesse bloud in ye outward than in ye inwards parts. Moreouer, there is no creature fuller of bloud amongst all them that haue receiued life, than women, wherefore nature doth vnburthen them euery moneth of all the superfluities of the bloud, and they are lesse subiect than men vnto all sicknesses which procéed of bloud. Albeit it hapneth (yet seldome) that they bléed at the nose, or by the Hemorrhoids, then do they quickly find, that they haue their termes the lesse. Secondly, the bloud also in the Hearts, Lights, and arteries, is much subtiler than that in the veines. The grosse bloud is drawne away by the flesh, whereby the foresaid bloud is more subtile; thin and scummy. The vpright good bloud, which is without any disease, is light red, sweete in taste, and not too thicke, and in that estate it may be sustained and augmented by good meate and drinke, if one take abundantly thereof: but to the contrary, it will be diminished through want of those things. The bloud doth especially increase by good strong wine moderat∣ly drunken, it maketh the same also faire and fresh, and especially the wine which is thick red, for that wine behoueth not to be much digested. In fine, according to that the food is good or bad, thereafter is the bloud qualified: for the far∣ther it is ingendred from his proper nature, so much the blacker it is. If the same spoile through abundance, then will in the broken veines be knots called Varices, whereof we haue written in the first chapter, and seuentéenth §. of the fift part: or it will be expelled through the bléeding at the nose, or through the Hemorrhoids: also it is oftentimes altered in impostumations and corruptions. What diseases are caused of the corruption of the bloud, that shall hereafter be taught and declared. Amongst all liuing creatures is the bloud of man the most subtile: as to the contrary, the Asses bloud the most grosse. So long as it doth remaine in the bodie, it doth kéepe his warme and moist nature: but as soone as it is out, then doth it thicken: yet one mans bloud more than anothers, whence afterwards you may separate the litle haires or Fibrae. The bloud of a Stéete is so hard, that being drunken it is a deadly poyson. Contrariwise, certaine beasts bloud doth not thicken at all, viz. Hares bloud, Conies bloud, Harts and Hinds bloud, the bloud of Roes, of Swine, of Goates, and such like moe. The Phi∣losophers opinion is, that all grosse thicke bloud doth giue strength, subtile and thinne bloud wittinesse, little bloud feare, and very litle wit. But for conclusion, this ensuing is a maruellous property of the bloud, that Nature hath placed such power therein, that the countenance of a man is altered in the twinckling of an eye, as happeneth in great anger, shamefastnesse and such, through the concourse of bloud. Contrarily, if the same depart from the face, it sheweth feare and fright. And in these alte∣rations of palenesse and rednesse, doth kéepe such a difference, that therby may be adiudged and knowne, how the heart and mind of man is disposed within. Whereby the bloud may be cleansed. §. 4. ALbeit that we haue taught enough for all sicknesses, which be caused through the vncleannesse of the bloud, by what meanes the bloud may be cleansed, yet can it not but be necessary to discouer certaine things here which be méete for the same. And first, what things they be: the confected Nutmegs are especial∣ly commended for this, because they make very good and haile bloud. Neuerthe∣lesse it is not aduised, that they which be of hote nature should vse the same vn∣lesse it be verie seldome.
We haue also declared in other places, that there is nothing that clenseth the blood more than Fumitorie, and all that is made of Fumitorie, as conserue, sirupe, iuice, water, and especially if the same be decocted in the whay of Goates milke. Rosemary is also highly commended for it. In the first part, the second Chapter, and first §. is a powder described, beginning thus, Take Sene leaues, which is also maruellous good for this purpose. Concerning the drinke, we haue told before that there is nothing better than good red wine. Amongst herb-wines, the Burrage wine, wine of Buglosse and of Tamariscus is commen∣ded: for this may you looke also into these places insuing, where there be diuers and sundrie things described, whereby the bloud may be cleansed, as in the third part, the eleuenth Chap∣ter, and sixt §. Item, in the fift part of the vlcers and of scabbednesse, which be commonly cau∣sed of vncleane bloud, as also of the Pockes and the Leprosie, hereafter shall be spoken of it in the description of Phlegma. How the abundant bleeding is to be stanched. §. 5. ALso there is nothing to be written of this abundant bléeding, but onely to al∣leage certaine places where diuers and sundrie remedies are set downe for to staunch bloud withall, as in the first part, the eight chapter, and seuenth §. Item in the first part, the ninth chapter, and fifth §. Also in the first part, the thirtéenth Chapter, and seuenth §. Item in the second part, the fift chap. and seuentéenth §. Item in the third part, the eighth chapter, and fourth §. Yet againe in the third part, the eleuenth chapter, and sixtéenth §. Item, more in the third part, the fourtéenth chapter, and 11. §. And if so be that this bléeding come vpon women in childbed too fast, then looke for it in the conclusion of the third part, and before in the seuenth chapter, where certaine precious vulnerall potions are described, in which places there may good meanes be found, according to the importance of the bléeding. How to let out superfluous blood. §. 6. IT is no lesse néedfull in many men to take away the superfluous bloud, whereby na∣ture is ouercharged, and many sicknesses caused, than in others to increase it, and this hapneth most conueniently through letting of bloud, through application of boxing cups, or through fastning of leaches. Of the letting of bloud we haue spoken at large in the Introduction, and also written of the sixtéene veines of the bodie which are wont to be opened, and likewise in what sick∣nesses each of them is to be opened, whereby each one that readeth it, shall find a good direction. The second meanes whereby this noisome bloud may be taken away, are the cups, whereof we haue discoursed at large in the foresaid Introduction. Also in like sort of the setting on of the Leaches, thither do we direct the Reader, and so conclude this Chapter. The eleuenth Chapter. Of the naturall warmth of mans bodie. BEcause we haue now written of the veines, and also how the same do spread themselues throughout the whole bodie, and other things concer∣ning this, therefore we will admonish of the naturall heate, which with the bloud is imparted vnto all parts of the bodie, for that the bloud and the naturall heate be so linked one with another and befriended, that one cannot continue without the other, but death must presently insue. Yea there is also none other thing that giueth shape in the beginning to all liuing bodies, and afterwards causeth them to increase to the houre of death, but this naturall heate which is borne with vs.
This is the onely cause of all working: and it is knowne, that all that groweth and increa∣seth, yea also all herbes and plants wust haue their nourishment thereby, and each according to the right propertie of his nature which giueth to each thing according to his néed, both moi∣sture and dreuth: but how were it possible that the same may be concocted and altered for the sustenance and increase of mans bodie, if there be no naturall warmth with it? This naturall warmth doth maintaine all health, and consumeth all bad humors, it consumeth also meat and drinke, whereby all inward parts do receiue their power and strength, and also are made apt to do all things whereto they were created. The hardned skin will be mellowed and made thin through this naturall heate, all wounds and vlcers be brought to naturall matter, it swageth the paine, it looseth and softeneth all con∣tracted sinewes. Item, this naturall heate is that which causeth the wounded head to heale, and freeth it from all his heauie accidents, drieth the moisture of the same, expelleth all corrup∣ted bones, and taketh away the venime of all corroding vlcers. This naturall warmth doth warme all frozen members, it helpeth all diseases of the Matrix and priuities, &c. The same naturall heate doth heale all broken bones. But how may that be better séene than by dayly examples, which we haue daily before our eyes, and as it appeareth in old folkes? for it is seene that how much the naturall heate abateth in them, so much the weaker and the more incurable do they waxe of all diseases: and most manifestly in the dying, where it is cleerely séene, that how much the more the naturall heate doth abate, so much the nearer is death at hand. There∣fore must héed alwayes be taken that it be kept in his naturall being: for if so be that the same be too great or too small in any body, then can follow none other but heauie sicknesses, and at length death it selfe. The like may be séene in the Palsie, and in the Plague. Therefore we wil here discouer certaine things which sustaine this naturall heat, and do increase and strengthen the same, and afterwards shew what is to be vsed against vnnaturall heate. First, there be certaine spiced wines, Claret wines, Hypocras wines, and such like commended for it, but they must be vsed with prouidence, to the end that according to the qualitie of nature and of the age they may be prepared, that they heate not ouermuch; for that the right nature of wine is, that it being moderatly drunken, doth preserue and sustaine the naturall warmth, and strengtheneth the powers of men. The same doth also Elecampane wine, and confected Nutmegs vsed mor∣ning and euening after meate. The conserue of Rosemarie doth warme all those which be halfe dead. But what néed is it to write so largely thereof, séeing there is no sicknesse, which cometh through cold described in all this booke, wherein hath not bene taught how this weake natural heate might be holpen? Hereafter also shall be spoken of the Phlegma, and by that meanes also of cold, and what is to be done for these cold diseases, where further aduertisement may be sought for. Of vnnaturall heate. §. 1. IN all hote diseases which haue bene discouered hitherto, be means euery where declared, wherewith this vnnaturall heate might be quenched and slaked. But we will here not onely alledge the passages where the same is taught, but also declare what may be méete for it. For this, are sundrie things described, as the cooling salue Galem, the salue of Roses, the salue of Saunders, and the Pomade. For this is also good the Poplar salue, all which you may mixe as you please, or vse each alone. In like manner these oyles following, as of Poppie heads, of Roses, of Vio∣lets, and of water Lillies, which do coole more than the oyle of Roses, or oyle of Violets. For an outward application, take the water of Corne Roses, and of Nightshade, of each two ounces, sealed earth, and fine Bolus, of each one dragme, Camfer ten graines, temper them all together, and lay it vpon the forehead, or where the heate is. One may vse inwardly the conserue of Buglosse, of Burrage, of water Lillies, of Violets, of Cicorie, of red and white Roses, confected Cherries, and conserue of Barberries. Item, confe∣cted rootes of Cicorie, Framboys, confected Peaches (which one may vse in all hote sicknesses) and Prunes that be confected. Item, fresh Cassie is very necessary in all vnnaturall and sharpe heate. The sowre Dates do coole and purge very mildly, and they do also quench the thirst. The
simple things be Lettice, Endiue, Cicorie, and bread that is stéeped in cold water, Fishes, Li∣mons, Oranges, Pompeons, Melons, sweete wine, Peares, Apples and Cherries, &c. These foresaid things are not only to be vsed in hote sicknesses, but also to take them moderatly being in health in hote times. There is also a sirupe made of the iuice of Oranges, of sowre Pomgra∣nates, of white Roses, and of Sorrell, the which do coole much in time of the Plague, and in all pestilentiall sicknesses, which do inflame the heart and the stomacke. The sirupe of Roses laxatiue doth especially coole all heate of Agues: likewise also the sirupe of Veriuice, of Violets, of Endiue, and of Vineger. In like manner also Oxycraton, Oxysacchara, Iulep of Roses, and of Violets: the honie of Roses hath a méetly cooling nature, therefore the same may also be vsed in hote Agues. When the patient desireth to drinke in great heate, then be some of these foresaid sirupes to be tempered amongst it, for which the sirupe of Violets, of Burrage, and of Roses, be the most principall, if the same be tempered with well water, or any cooling potion. The same doth also fresh well water alone. Item, Barly water, or Henbroth dressed with Endiue, watred wine, Henbroth with Su∣gar and Barly, and the water of Larks spur drunken thrée or foure times a day, these before∣said do take away the vnnaturall heate, whether it be in the Plague, or in any other hot agues. Take water of Larks spur and of Buglosse, of each two ownces, Cicorie water one ounce, drinke twice thereof morning and euening: it strengtheneth and cooleth also the heart in all hote things. Take a handfull of Raisins, stampe them to pap, and powre vpon it eight ounces of water of Buglosse, Cinnamome one dragme, then wring it thorow a cloth, and afterwards take it, or giue it to drinke with Almond milke. But if so be that some vnnaturall heate do assaile you without any speciall sicknesse, then is this ensuing to be vsed for it: Take a blacke Cockrell of a yeare old, chop it aliue one part from another, take the Liuer, and stampe it very warme in a mortar, then temper with it womans milke of one that giueth sucke to a boy, afterwards wring it together through a cloth, and giue thereof to the ouerheated bodie two or thrée spoonfuls. Some do commend this verie highly, and it may be tried without perill. Item, the iuice of gréene Nutshels be very good against all accidents which may be caused of heate. The twelfth Chapter. Of the Sweate in generall. AFter the description of vnnaturall heate, we are to write somewhat also of the sweate (which is contained in the corrupted bloud) and pierceth through the whole bodie. The same is thus briefly described of Galen. Sweat is a cleansing and an excessiue moisture which is mixed with the bloud as the whay is with the milke. Other do expound it more at large. The sweate (say they) is a moisture, which is caused of the vapors of the bodie, which spreadeth it out to the vttermost parts of the bodie, and pe∣netrateth out through the skin, whereby the bloud is vnburthened of much vncleannes, whereof there be two sorts, the one naturall, which in great sicknesses is a good signe or Crisis, which kind of sweate doth breake out also vpon men through great labour, or in Sommer time, and is a wholesome and healing sweate, which bringeth great ease and lightening with it. The other kind of sweate is vnnaturall and also hurtfull, as is séene in them which suffer great paine, or that lye a dying: therefore it is not vniustly said (as also the truth is, that sweate is a signe of all the moystnesse which raigneth in the bodie. For when as the sweate breaketh forth excessiuely, then is it a signe of great abundance of subtile moystures, and of the strength of the expulsiue vertue. Like as to the contrary, a little sweate giueth know∣ledge of the toughnesse & thicknesse of the same, or debilitie of the expulsiue power. If so be that the sweate be red, then is it a signe that the bloud hath the maisterie: but if so be that the sweate be yellow, then hath Cholera the preheminence; or if it be white, Phlegma: and if it be blackish, Melancholia. And if so be that the sweate stinke, then must the bloud also in the veines whence
the said sweate commeth, stinke also. Item, these differences may be perceiued by the toong, that when one will prooue his sweate and the same be swéete, then is it a signe that the bloud raig∣neth; and if bitter, then Cholera, &c. The causes of the sweat be ouer hot ayre, great labour, warme weather, bathing, to goe too hot clothed, and a moyst body. But commonly it is caused through great rioting which is late∣ly committed: the first cause will be taken away, if one beware of labour, and tary out of warme aire &c. The second through purging: but the sweate may come of whatsoeuer cause that it will, it is alwaies very profitable for a moyst body, and healthfull: therefore is the same to be required in many sundry perillous diseases, viz. in franticknes, Phrenitide, in which the sweate is especially very méete if the same be excessiuely expelled. The Phisitions which be very expert haue taken through the sweate no small signification of life or of death, and especially in those dayes which they call Criticos, which be these insuing, that do yéeld also a good prognostication of health. The 3. 5. 7. 9. 11. 14. 20. 21. 24. 27. 30. 31. 34. & 40. The other which commeth betweene these foresaid daies do signifie to the contrarie a long continuing sicknes. This sweating is also euery where common with all agues, and especially in all hot agues, but after a seuerall or different manner: for if the sweate be cold, and that it be onely about the head, in the face, and in the necke, then it is a very bad signe: if it come with a sharp ague, then is it a signe of death, or commeth it with a mild ague, then doth it signifie a lingring sicknes: by which it also signifieth that where the sweate doth breake out, there the disease and the sicknes is. Moreouer, we will adde this vnto it, that when the blood is vnmeasurable moyst, thence springeth alwaies a verie gréeuous sicknes, for that thereby it will be waterish (like as the whay of milke) retaining neuerthelesse the red colour, whereby it commeth also that a body sweateth blood otherwhiles. For sweating be also these rules insuing prescribed. First, the sweate is not to be mooued be∣fore, and yer that the matter be purged whence that this is prouoked, and so long as the pati∣ent feeleth ease thereby, & be not ouer much weakened. Secondly, in consuming maladies, as Hectica, and Phthisis, sweating is not meete. Thirdly, if the sweating get so much the masterie, that a body is thereby weakened, then is the sweating to be caused to cease by vncouering or ta∣king away the couerings. Or doth it come through ouer much heate▪ then is the patient to liue soberly, and to fast. But if so be that it do come through repletion of the bodie, then is the same moysture or humour which causeth the sweate, to be purged. Afterwards is the bodie to be an∣nointed with this salue following: Take Roses one ounce, red Saunders, blossomes of Pome∣granates, Galles, and Mirtle leaues, of each halfe an ounce: séeth all togither in fower and twentie ounces of water vntill the third part be spent; afterwards straine it thorow a cloth, and put vnto it sixe ounces of the oyle of Roses, and then let it séeth so long vntill all the water be consumed, afterwards straine it thorow a cloth. With this salue is the patient espe∣cially to annoynt the side and the breast. He is also to drinke oftentimes Iulep of Roses, and of Violets, and to moysten the breast sometimes and the sides with cold-water, and also to sléepe alone, but vpon no bed which is filled with feathers, and that but light couered. The sweating causeth also sometimes swouning which is not without danger. This pati∣ent is not to be bounden, rubbed, nor to kéepe in his breath, like as is done to others which fall into a swouning by some other cause: for that the foresaid things doe driue out more matter and sweate out of the bodie. For this also is wine to be eschued, for that it expelleth also sweate: but the face is to be sprinckled with Rose water, and with well water. The patient must also refraine from ouer hot labour, and not to couer himselfe too much. He must set his bed in a cold place, and hang the same with cold odoriferous things, as Roses, Saunders, Camfer, Quin∣ces, Waterlillies, and such like. Whereby the Sweate is prouoked. §. 1. AT the first are the pores to be opened, as doth the oile of Cammomill, and of Dill, if one be annoynted therewith: or take Pepper, Cinnamom, Calmus, Rapontica, Pie∣retrum, Rubarb, Costus, Cassie wood, Balsam fruits, Marierom gentle, and the iuice of white Mints; temper some of these foresaid things togither and séeth them with Sallad oile in wine, and annoynt you therewith, it causeth a man to sweate.
Further, these things following are to be vsed before one go to bed, therewith to expell the sweate, to wit, halfe a dragme or a whole dragme of Treacle or Mithridate. Item, take an O∣nion, and put good Treacle into it, afterwards rost it soft in hote ashes, and eate a good deale thereof, then lay you in bed to sweate therewith, and afterwards drie your selfe cleane with drie clothes. For bathing, he is to take the quantitie of a nut of conserues of Rosemary, or conserue of Fu∣mitorie, both of them do expel sweate: the conserue of Elderne berries is the common peoples physicke for this purpose. Item, take Rose water, Wormewood water, and Rue water, of each a like quantitie, and vse thereof euery morning a good draught: or take one ounce of Ginger, and séeth it in a pint of red wine; afterwards straine it without wringing, and then drinke fiue ounces thereof: it causeth also to sweate well, and that especially in quartaine Agues. Now to the end to abate the heate, then temper amongst it iulep of Violets. Oxymel compositum doth also moue sweate. But if one cannot sweate, then take two or thrée bricke stones and make them very hot, and wrap them in a wet cloth, and lay first one, and then another to the féete, vnder the arme-pits, or the sides of the patient, or betwéene his legs; then will the vapor cause the patient to sweate. And if so be that there be a stinking sweate instant, like as the stench of the arme-pits, whereof we haue written in the fourth part, the first chapter, and the second §. and in the second chapter, in the third §. then may one with the foresaid, vse this ensuing: Take white Coperas halfe an ounce, let it boyle so long in a pint of water as one would seeth an egge hard, or somewhat lon∣ger, and wash you therewith. Also the sweate will be expelled by annointing with oile of Quin∣ces, or by taking of Marmalade made with spice. Of the sweate-bath and other. §. 2. IT is very common that sweate is vsually prouoked by bathes, which is attempted after diuers maners, and must be done for many kinds of maladies, as we haue de∣clared in many places: for which now that bathing is noisome and bad, we haue also taught here and there, as the same may be looked for in the Table. The thirteenth Chapter. Of the Sinewes. IT is a question amongst certaine learned men whence the sinews (which the Latinists call Neruos) haue their beginning. Aristoteles was of opinion that they came from the heart, although it cannot be perceiued that there hence any should come: but Galenus with his followers do say that the sinewes take their beginning in the braines and the backe-bone. And this opinion is not without a foundation and sure ground, because that as soone as the sinewes be inflamed with any vnnaturall heate, the braines thereby are so infected, that commonly these men be distraught of their wits and vnderstanding, yea waxe childish, and as the Phisitions name it Deliri. Albertus doth reckon to be in mans bodie 77. sinewes, as wel great as small, hard, soft, and o∣ther; and therein do all learned agrée, that they be all of a cold nature, yet the one lesse than the other, and also without blood, wherefore some call them the white veines. Amongst these be thrée principall sorts: the first which we chiefly call Neruos, which is sinewes: the second Ten∣dones, which be the tendones: the third Ligamenta, which be ligaments or binding sinewes. The first sort haue their beginning in the braines, of both the skins of the braines, & in the back∣bone, the which Albertus calleth the vicegerent of the braines, for that they be both almost of one nature. These Nerui or sinewes, the which by the Grecians is as much to say as bending, be by nature a little warmer and also drier than the veines or any other sinewes, they are also more sensible than the arteries, and of such power that they franke and fréely impart vnto the whole body all motion and féeling. These foresayd sinewes are by nature so placed in the back bone, and his holes, which be 60.
in number, and that they be spread ouer the whole bodie, giuing each part his sence and action; so that each may adiudge what is hurtfull for him, or paineth any whit. They do spread them∣selues abroade ouer the whole bodie, to wit, out of the backbone, as it were a spring, which with many sundrie spouts or gutters is deriued hither and thitherwards, in a pleasant garden, for to moisten the same, and to impart her water vnto it: So is also our bodie naturally nouri∣shed with these sinewes and all other veines, which (like as is sayd) receiue their beginning out of the braines, and so descend euen to the féete beneath. And although this dispersion be so bountifully and pleasantly performed, notwithstanding there come no sinewes into the bones, except the téeth, neither yet in the gristles, nor in the fatnesse, nor in the ligaments (which be the knitters of the members or ioynts) therefore all these foresaid parts haue no féeling or motion, neither néede they any. When as now the foresaid sinewes are spread abroad euery where in the muscles or lacerts, which (as is sayd) are instruments whereby we haue all our motion, yet in other places, where need requireth, the other sort are, to wit, the tendones. These be of a tight compacted substance, easily cut in the length, ouerthwart very hardly or scant at all. When as they also (like as is oftentimes admonished) be wounded, then are they healed with great trouble. They can also abide no fire, like as the sinewes do; for whensoeuer one is wounded or hurt, then doth the same member loose his accustomed action, or will at the least be much weakened. It is also much to be wondered at, to wit, when a sinew is hurt, that then there followeth much paine and mishap after it; and being hewed or cut quite asunder, that then the patient knoweth not of any paine. The tendones or lacerts be amongst these thrée sorts of sinewes the most hardest: contrari∣wise, the ligaments be the most softest, as shall be shewed hereafter. These tendones be also not so sensible as the right sinewes, and be also much bigger. The third sort of sinewes the Grecians doe call Syndesmos, the Latinistes Ligamenta, (which be bonds or knitters) Albertus doth call them Cordàs, that is, cords: these haue no féeling where they hold fast in the muscles or bones, but they bind onely the muscles and bones together. Let this now suffice of the nature of the sinewes, and they that desire to haue ampler di∣rection thereof, let them looke into Aristoteles, Galenus, Albertus, and other Anatomici, which haue written thereof very largely. Of hurt and wounded sinewes. §. 1. COmmonly the perished sinewes do require such remedies as are wont to be vsed for the increase of the inféebled warmth, and do drie hard and draw, yet without any corroding and bad propertie. The wounds are also to be kept open long, and if so be that they be too narrow, then make them wider, to the end that all bad matter may run out. Besides that, all diligence is to be vsed for to asswage the paine. If now there be any sinew pricked in letting of blood, or otherwise, then take oyle of Cammomill, of Roses, and oyle of S. Iohns wort, of each one ounce, thrée well brayed yolkes of egges, and Saffron one scruple, temper them all together, and lay it thereon. For the paine. §. 2. IF so be that there be any great paine in the wounded sinews, then vse the salues Anodyna, whereby the paine may be asswaged, whereof you may find sufficiently written in the first part, the 4. chapt. and 12. §. in the second part, the 7. chapter: in the third part, the 16. chap. and 4. §. also in the third part, the 17. chap. and 2. §. This ensuing is also very meet for it: Take oyle of Lillies, one ounce and a half, oyle of Dill and of Cammomill, of each one ounce, white Waxe as much as is néedfull for to make a salue. Another Anodynum. Take Walflowers thrée ounces, oyle of swéete Almonds, and oyle of Sesamum, of each one dragme and a halfe, fresh Butter one ounce, Saffron halfe a dragme; white waxe one dragme and a halfe, oile of Dill, of Cammomill, and Duckes grease,
of each one quarter of an ounce, one wel brayed yolk of an egge; then temper them togither vn∣to a salue. For this you haue also before in the third chapter, and 7. §. a salue, beginning thus, Take oile of Roses &c. and other things moe, which do much asswage the paine. Item, take the marrow of Calues bones, and very old Sallad oyle, of each foure ounces, Earthwormes washt in wine two ounces, séeth them togither in water meetely well, after∣wards straine the broth thorow a cloth: it is maruellous good for the sinewes, for that it asswa∣geth all paine, and mollifieth the sinewes. These foresaid things be not only good for the paine of the sinewes, which be caused through wounds, but also for all other paine of the sinewes, as this following is also: Take Henbane seed halfe an ounce, black Poppie séed one quarter of an ounce, Saffron one ounce, Hermodactyli two ounces and a halfe, small brused crums of bread foure ounces; temper them all togither, and so lay this warme vpon it, and that thrice in foure and twenty houres: afterwards an∣noint the place with oyle of Foxes, or with any such like oyle, which shall hereafter be discoue∣red: After that strew the powder of Earthwormes vpon it; or temper the powder with Honie, and vse it as before. It is also good for all paine of the members, and hardning of the sinewes. There may also a plaister be made of the foresaid Earthwormes, and apply it. Cow dung tem∣pered with oyle and laid warme vpon it, is also good. Item, take oyle of Foxes thrée ounces, Sallad oyle foure ounces, Earthwormes washed in Wine two ounces; let them séeth all togither, like as is said before, it strengtheneth maruel∣lous much all brused sinewes, and warmeth also the same, when they be wounded. Oyle of Bricks is good for all paine, and all diseases of the sinewes. In like manner the thrée sorts of Balsam oyle which be described in the last part. When the Sinewes be resolued and limber. §. 3. TAke Turpentine which is many times washed with Rose water two ounces, pouned Frankinsence, and Cornes of the same, of each two dragmes and a halfe; make a salue thereof. This doth also a salue which is made with washed Lyme and Sallad oyle, or oyle of Saint Iohns wort. Item, there is also good for this all vitall waters. For Sinewes that be shrunke, or for the Crampe of the Sinewes. §. 4. ITem, take one ounce of the plaister Diachilon, Ammoniacum and Bdellium, of each one quarter of an ounce; stéepe these two gums foure and twenty houres in Vineger, and afterwards let them séeth vntill all the Vineger be spent, then mixe the playster amongst it, and also fiue dragmes of Beares grease: when it is now sufficiently boyled, then worke it well togither with the hands, the hands being first made wet in Vineger. This Plaister doth mollifie and digest: Or take the féeds of Hollihocks, of Flaxe, and of Fenegréeke, of each two ounces, oyle of Lil∣lies, and of Oliues, of each one ounce, Waxe as much as is needfull for a salue: this salue softe∣neth all manner of hardnes of the sinewes and of the ioints, it asswageth the paine, it streng∣theneth the extenuated members. Take oyle of Bohen two ounces, Ammoniacum, Bdellium, of each two dragmes, Saffron two scruples, white Waxe as much as will suffice for a soft oyntment: at the last adde one ounce of Neates foote oyle vnto it. Item, take oyle of Spikenard, oyle of Saffron, of each sixe dragms, Beuercod, Ammoniacum, Sagapenum; Badgers grease and Beares grease, of each three dragms, marrow of Oxe bones halfe an ounce, Waxe as much as will suffice, besprinkle them all with Vineger of Squils. If you would haue it digest and drie stronger, adde vnto it Pellitory of Spaine, Beuercod, Euphorbium, and rootes of Costirs, of each two dragmes, Saltpeter halfe a dragme, make it all into an oyntment: This oyntment is good for the Palsey, and coldnes of the sinewes, but especially for the shaking in the fit of an ague. The salue Dialthaea, is very good for the contraction and shortning of the sinewes.
Item, take Cammomill floures, sprigs of the Iuniper trée, Sage, Mallowes, Southern∣wood, and Nettle rootes, of each one handfull, shread and beate them very small, and put vnto them 16. ounces of fresh Butter, Dogs grease 12. ounces, boile them together vntil all the iuice of the herbs be consumed, then straine them, and adde vnto them molten waxe thrée ounces, Ammoniacum, Galbanum, of each one ounce, dissolue the gums in Vineger, & mixe them with the rest: when it beginneth to coole, stirre amongst it oyle of Beuercod 6. drag. oyle of Cammomill 2. ounces, oyle of Bayes 8. ounces, lastly, temper them well together. The Apothecaries do call it Ʋnguentum Neruinum,Vnguentum Neruinum. but it is not vsed euery where. Item, take Waxe, Pitch, and marow of Oxe bones, of each one ounce, oyle of Roses two ounces, mixe them all together, and put vnto them the powder of Earthwormes, and so annoynt the place agréeued with it. As concerning the Cramp (which is nothing else but a contraction and conuulsion of the sinewes) hath béene spoken in the first part the 12. Chap. and 15. §. where also I shewed what might be vsed for it. And this following is very méete for the same: Take the iuice of broad Plaintaine, boile it with strong wyne, and binde it vpon the place where the Cramp is. Item, take the rootes of water-Lillies, cut them in round slices, and so apply them, it hath béene approued oftentimes. When the Cramp commeth in one foote, then bend back one of your toes, or bind it hard with a whip∣cord: but the best counsell is, to arise presently and walke, and to kéepe the foote warme. Cramp rings are also worne for it, but I finde no great good in them. These oyles following are very commodious for the Cramp, to wit, oyle of Lillies, of Rue, of Wallfloures, and of Turpentine, which is made as followeth: Take Turpentine 3. pound, put it into a body, make fast the head and the receiuer vnto it very close, distill it in sand or ashes with an easie fire. First, there com∣meth ouer a cleare water with the oyle, next, a yellow oyle, lastly, a darke and grosse oyle, kéepe each apart, for they are good for all cold griefes, and especially for them of the sinewes. There is also good for it the oyle of Tyles, oyle of Quinces, which also comforteth the sinewes. The oyle of Cammomill is not only good for the sinewes, but also for all the ioynts. The oyle of S. Iohns wort is especiall good for the same. The ridge in the back being annoynted with the oyle of Iuniper, restoreth motion into all parts. Oyle of Bayes, of bitter Almonds, and of Beuercod, haue an especiall vertue to soften the hard and contracted sinewes. Now follow those things which may be vsed inwardly. BOth the kinds of Treacle, and the Mithridate are maruellous good for the infections of the sinewes. Item, take Calmus, floures of Stechados, of each thrée ounces, Currans, Fennell rootes, Parsly rootes, of each one ounce, Centory, Coloquinte, Hermodactilis, of each halfe an ounce, boyle them in a quart of water vnto the halfe, and straine them out hard, then put 12. ounces of Hony vnto it, and let them boyle together againe vntill they be reasonable thick, afterwards put vnto them fine powder of prepared Agarick one ounce, Turbith halfe an ounce, Ginger and Diagridion, of each one drag. and a halfe, Spike of Indie one drag. make an Electu∣ary of them. This Electuary purgeth all plegmatick, tough, gréene, and waterish matter from all the parts of the body both inward and outward. It asswageth all paines of the ioynts, sinewes, and such like. Giue of it at once foure or sixe dragmes with the decoction of Ginger, if phlegme do abound. Contrarywise in a cholerick bodie giue it with the water of Succory very warme, and let him fast sixe houres after it, and before he be set downe to dinner, let him drinke a good draught of Meade. For the same purpose also serueth the confection of Diacorum, and especially the first of them which are described in the last part. Likewise the conserue of La∣uender, of Spikenard, of Sage, and the preserued rootes of Eringus. His common drinke shall be Meade, or Honywater. Amongst the herbed wines are these commended, the wines of Elecampane rootes, of Rosemary, of Sage and of Wormewoode. These wynes are all very good for the sinewes not only taken inwardly but also the infected places chafed and fomented outwardly. Common clisters are sometimes vsed for to comfort the sinewes, wherof there be diuers described almost euery where, and such as may be vsed ac∣cording to the place infected. But a little Coloquint is for the most part added vnto them all. This contraction and induration of the sinewes doth in time turne to a perfect lamenesse, whereof hath bene spoken before in the fourth part, the seuenth chapter, and second §. and af∣ter that in this fift part in the second chapter of the Pockes, in which places you may find suffi∣cient
store of remedies to content your selfe. These things following are very hurtfull for the sinewes, the continuall vse of strong wines, enery, idlenes, slothfulnes, warme water, and especially in them that are wounded in the sinewes. The fourteenth Chapter. Of the flesh and Muscles or Lacerts. WE must now speake of the flesh of the body which couereth the bones, veines, sinewes, and in fine, all that is comprehended in the skin. First in respect of those parts which we call Muscles or Lacerts, the flesh in La∣tin called Caro, is very little in quantitie; for the number of Muscles is so infinite, that it hath béene vnpossible for the auncient Phisitions to name them all. Some did take them to be in number fiue hundreth, Al∣bertus 529. The flesh and muscles are ingendred of the bloud; they are warme and moyst by nature, and soft in handling, and those that are coldish by nature (without any euident heate) they haue much and very soft flesh. That which we call flesh, is placed euery where betwéen the muscles, only differing in this, that the muscles are contained in a thin subtill membrane, to the end that the sinewes with their small twigs might the better passe through it, & impart their motion vnto the muscles. This flesh is other∣whiles changed into fat, to wit, in fat men, or in them that liue delicately; or else sometimes it decreaseth and the muscles also vpon diuers occasions. They that are very fleshy haue also big veines, full of black bloud, with great entrayles, and a big belly. These persons are especi∣ally commanded by all learned Phisitions, that they shall not purge themselues in Sommer time. The other kind of flesh, namely Muscles and Lacerts, are peraduenture so called, because they are not vnlike to the Euets: for Lacerta in Latine is a Lyzard or Euet in English, Ari∣stotle, Albertus, Galenus, with diuers others haue written very curiously of the veynes and sinewes, and haue shewed how they are dispersed and spread abroade ouer all the body, and how by the Muscles they moue and stirre euery member seuerally, whereof we néede not at this present make any further mention. But to speake of them in briefe: the bodie of the muscles is made of thrée seuerall kinds of substance, for their beginning and the very head of them is full of sinewes. Their middle (which is called the belly of the muscle) is flesh. Their tayle, or the ends of the muscles is harder and more sinewie then the head, whereof the Tendons are made. In fine, these Muscles do consist of sinewes, of flesh, of ligaments, and velmes, so that by the multitude of these sinewes, are all the parts of the body moued inward and outward, vp∣wards and downewards, quickly or slowly, too and fro, all as a man will himselfe. Besides this, they are according to their situations of diuers proportions, as long, thick, broad, &c. and so strangely coadunated and conioyned, that their vse may easier be perceiued by their motion, than by sight, or by any other meanes whatsoeuer, but especially, in the face, in the forehead, and in the lips. These muscles may not be wounded without great danger, for by reason of the sinewes which passe through them, by those wounds very great and heauy accidents must needs ensue. But the greatest danger is wounding, hurting, or in any way harming them of the back, for then can the patient neither make water, nor go to the stoole, nor do any other bu∣sines at all aright. By these meanes commeth the Cramp, the falling sicknes. I wil not speake of the great misfortune that might follow if the same do putrifie. Because therefore the muscles are very sensible, they do finde by ouermuch labour, by long walking, by running, and such like, a great debilitie, wearisomnes, and paine; so do the sinewes also and the Tendons themselues. But it were in vaine to shew at this present how all the infirmities that the muscles are subiect vnto might be remedied, because the same hath béene sufficiently spo∣ken of in those places where we haue intreated of Vlcers, Wounds, Pocks, Leprosie, and such like.
The fifteenth Chapter. Of the fat of Mans bodie. AFter the description of the flesh it is verie néedfull that we write and dis∣course of the fat in mans bodie. This fat is a deuision of the nourish∣ment in the skin and other parts, heaped insensibly and tight togither: this insensiblenes hath the fat of the blood whence it is ingendred; for that the fat is none other thing, but digested blood, which also is insen∣sible. By nature it is most moyst; therefore the fat of all beasts, and also the fat of men is woont to be vsed for many kinde of diseases, as may be seene héere and there in this Booke: and (as it is said) the fat hath his be∣ginning of the fattest part of the blood, which runneth through the veines towards the skin, and setting it selfe on the same and on the sinewes (both which are dry by nature) for to moy∣sten them. But if it happen to touch the parts that be cold and bloodles, then doth it come to congeale, and to waxe hard there: therefore that doth most of all happen in cold bodies, viz. in women, and in all such beasts which haue béene kept all winter, and be vnmeasurable fat; where to the contrarie, all that be hot by nature, waxe leane and weake. Amongst all parts of men and beasts there are none that be fatter than the kidneies, and that chiefly on the left kid∣neies, more than on the right; yet especially in shéepe wherein that the kidneies be other∣whiles so abundantly couered with fat that they cannot make water, but are constrained thereby to die. Of the troublesomnes of Fatnes. §. 1. THere is no better disposition of bodie, as well amongst new borne children, as other ancient people, but that a man be meetely fat, not too leane, nor too fat: or if so be that any of both must be, it is alwaies better to be leane than fat: for that if a bodie be ouerburthened with fatnes, then happeneth it amongst other incon∣ueniences, that a bodie be alwaies slothfull, vnfit for labour, and for walking. I say nothing of other diseases and sicknesses which fat people be more subiect to, than the leane. This excessiue fatnes commeth of blood, whereby all the parts of a mans bodie be fed and sustained: the fat bodies haue alwaies narrow veines, and arteries, and therefore also little blood, and fewer vitall spirits; so that when they begin to be old, the naturall heate is wholly abated and verie lightly might be extinguished, or at least wise spilt and lost. Where∣fore Hippocrates also saith by good right, that they that be fat by nature, do die much sooner, than they that be leane. But they that are betwéene both by nature (saith he) and afterwards waxe fat by their daintie and bountifull diet, they alwaies kéepe their great veines, although they increase in flesh and fatnes, therefore in them is lesse daunger, although they be fat, and that their naturall heate be corrupted in them. Also the Philosophers do conclude (like as we also daily see before our eies) that both humaine and bruite beasts bodies which are verie fat, do remaine vnfruitefull. For they haue but little and weake naturall séed, bicause that (as is said) leanenes is to be commended farre before fatnes of the body. Therefore must all men which are inclined to be fat, vse these things following: Take Sandaraca thrée quarters of an ounce, drinke it in the morning with water, and with Oxymel. Item, take the rindes of yellow Mirobalanes (rost them as though that they were halfe burnt) one quarter of an ounce: stamp them all to a subtile powder, and then giue it to drinke with Plantaine water. Looke also into the second part, the third chapter, and second §. for the Pils which maruellously hinder fatnes. Item, take euerie morning a crust with vineger, wherein a little Pepper is tempered, drinke it verie warme. But if one feare that it might hurt the sinewes, then is it to be forborne.
The sixteenth Chapter. For great Leannes. THe reason why leaunes is better for a bodie than fatnes, we haue disco∣uered before: neuerthelesse if the leannes were excéeding much, then is it verie daungerous for healthie folkes: for it behooueth no great proofe that the bodie waxeth leane, when it wanteth food, or when the meate doth not digest, and is not conueied to the appropriate members, or when people be ouercharged with intollerable labour, with great sor∣row, and such like. Likewise do some also fall into great leannes, for that their bodie is too cold and too dry: other will also be leane, for that the digestiue and nutritiue vertues, or any of both these be weakened. Item, this extreame leannes is caused also of the consumption Phthisis, whereof we haue sufficiently written before, and also in the fourth part, the seuenth chapter, and second §. For this may first be vsed all that is forbidden in the excessiue fatnes: neither is counsell to be deferred ouer long in this disease of leannes: for when as the leannes beginneth to roote, then doth the same not onely prouoke Phthisin, which is the consumption; but also other moe deadly accidents: so that not only all the flesh of mans body will be consumed, but also all the vertue and strength. And what might be vsed for this falling away, is to be sought for in the two forementioned places, there is especially commended (amongst other outward remedies) the rubbing with the flat of the hand of all outward members. All they that are woont lightly to parbrake, may not be purged in winter, when this leannes is not caused through some hot agues, but that the meat receiued is not by nature conueied towards his due place: so that (like as it is woont to chance oftentimes) the ordure is cast out of the mouth, then is the patient to vse good white wine for his drinke, yet tempered with water wherein Fennell seed is decocted. For his meate be Hens, Capons, or rather the broth of them, that is wroong or stamped out of their flesh. This patient is also to foment often his priuities and there about, with a spoonge dipped in the decoction of these things following: Take Fenegréeke séed, and of the white Sesamum, of each fower ounces, Mallowes and Smallage, of each thrée handfuls, Bdellium halfe a dragme, Comin thrée drag. Caruway, Dill séed, Ameos, Fennell, of each halfe an ounce, field Cipers, Centorie, of each halfe a handfull, cut that is to be cut, and stamp the rest, let it séeth in sufficient water. You are also to vse a warming plaister for the stomacke, whereof there be séene in the third part, the eleuenth chapter, and 5. §. and elsewhere described. This plaister ensuing is also good for it: Take twelue ounces of the broth wherein shéeps et hath boyled a good while, Sallad oyle and Butter, of each two ounces, Saffron 6. graines, Salt one dragme, slight Sugar one ounce and a halfe, temper it, and set this Clister one hower and a halfe before supper; at which time he is to vse the powder which is described in the third part, the 16. chapter, and 3. §. beginning thus, Take Annis, Fennell, &c. The seuenteenth Chapter. Of VVearisomnes. WE haue taught in the description of the Muscles, that the wearynes of the body is caused through great labour, which weakeneth the sinewes and the Muscles, as daily experience doth teach vs: and when a man is weary without this cause, as though one had beaten his members in péeces, then doth it signifie a great imminent disease. The learned do de∣uide this wearisomnes into many kind of species, as they that come of vlcers, wounds, and such like, which may be apparantly perceiued. This doth come through great coldnes of the matter, which is very easily to be cured, by warme dwellings, by rubbings, by swéet bathes, and such like; which doe warme the members, open the pores, and make the matter in the sinewes and muscles subtile.
Nature is also to be kept warme with eating and drinking: wherefore euery such patient is to keepe himselfe with good white wine which is not too strong, and to vse other things moe, which shall seeme meete for all cold diseases, whereof we (for a conclusion of this fift part) shall write immediatly hereafter. Now we purpose onely to speake of the wearisomnes which is caused of great labour: for the which there is no better nor safer remedy than rest and sléepe. But this following may be vsed for it: Take Rue as much as you please, temper it well with Sallad oile, and therewith annoint both the féete: it is very good. Item, take a little Salt in a cloth, bind it fast togither, and dip it in the water, cast it into the fire, let it rost vntill it be blacke, and run togither; afterwards poune it and temper it with Vi∣neger, wet therein a woollen clout, and rub therewith the soles of the féete. The eighteenth Chapter. Of Sleepe. IF it be well considered what sléepe is, then doth it not beare in vaine the high title which is attributed vnto it: and because that the sleepe doth also oppresse the whole body, passeth through each part of the same, and brin∣geth it to rest, therefore it is by good right placed in that degrée. Concer∣ning his title, the learned do write as followeth. Sléepe is a continuing and a moistening of naturall heate, an elected rest of all the members, which doth none otherwise couer and suppresse all motions of the minde, than as the ashes do the fire, which by a little stirring or vncouering of it, will immediatly burne againe. And if so be that this rest, which is imparted to the body by sleepe, and is as it were a remedie of labour, then may it well be thought, that they that cannot rest at all do sléepe vnnaturally, for that it taketh away the wits and all actions of the minde: wherefore sleepe is called of Ouidius, and Seneca Tragicus, a compeller of all mishap, and a rest of the mind, the best part of life, an image of death to come, and Deaths brother. And further, this sléepe is a confuser of the true and false visions, a hauen of life, a taker away of wearied sight, and with the Poets, the pleasantest amongst all goods, yea the onely giuer of tranquility on earth. For sleepe driueth away sorrow, it is the remedy for sorrow and care, it fréeth the hart, and bringeth all things to rest. The foresaid sléepe is a quickning of the weary and weake members, a strengthener of the labourer. It maketh the King and his subiects merry, sorie, and blessed. And to conclude, it is then so néedfull for nature, that without sléepe this life cannot be vpholden. You haue before in the first part, the 12. chapter, and 6. §. also in the 10. §. of the li∣thargy; and in the sixe naturall things in the first part, the fift chapter, and 10. §. all which may serue for this intent. Yet these be the things which prouoke sléepe, viz. Conserues of water-Lillies, sirupe of Poppy heads, which may be vsed for this purpose: Lettice eaten in the eue∣ning for Sallads is also good: The Conserue of Piony stayeth all fantasies and feare by night, which will hinder men of their sléepe: Sirupe of Citrons, Wormewood wine, oyle of Dill, oyle of Poppy heads, and also that which is beaten out of the heads, and the temples of the head annoynted therewith, are very méete for it. What hindereth sleepe. §. 1. THere shall not here be written of Lethargo, which is a species of the Palsey, and described in the first part, the twelfth chapter, and 10. §. but of that sléepe which causeth a body to his great hinderance to sleepe too much, in some kind of grieuous agues, phlegmaticke sicknesses, sweating sicknes, and such like. Now for to keepe sluggards and sléepers waking, thereto are merrie folks fit to company with one, pleasant spéech, musicke, and play, if the patient haue any desire of it: the rubbing of the armes and legs, with or without footwater, cold water, honie of Roses holden in the mouth: in like manner also the annoynting on the temples of the head with cold water, and the same sprinkled in the face.
The nineteenth Chapter. Of Paine. WE will not here dispute of the outward paine of the bodie, or the inward paine of the conscience, whereof the Philosophers and Diuines do write. Our booke doth onely speake of Phisickes sicknesses, wherein the paine is such an accident of humane debilitie, that there commeth not one so small a sicknesse wherewith there is not otherwhiles some paine, like as may be séene by al the foresaid infirmities: and as is here in particular discoursed of all sicknesses, and to each is attributed his proper remedies for to assuage at least the paine of the same if it cannot be cured: where∣fore we will send the Reader, and euery one that hath occasion to take aduise therein, to the titles of all diseases that do molest the bodie with paine. The twentith Chapter. Of Phlegma. AS we haue oftentimes admonished before that the body of man and the most part of all other liuing creatures are made and sustained of many kinds of humors, that so long also as the same be equally tempered, do bring health with them: contrariwise, if that one do raigne aboue ano∣ther, it doth cause a sicknesse. Of Cholera when it getteth the mastery, then do hote sicknesses grow out of it, as may further be read in the description of the Gall. In like manner also it is taught in the Chapter of the hote stomacke, and in other places moe. Of the burnt blacke bloud of Melancholia hath bene spoken in the first part, the twelfth chapter, and eighth §. and in the second part, the fourth chapter, and ninth §. Item, in the fifth chapter and fiftéenth §. also in the third part, the eleuenth chapter, and 28. §. and in other places moe. Concerning the cleane blood, thereof hath bene written not long ago in the tenth chapter and third §. so that we by good right may also write of the Phlegma, because that the same doth no lesse penetrate the bodie than the other. This bodily humor which is called of the Grecians Phlegma, and of the Latinists Pituita, is a waterish moisture which runneth through the veines of all the bodie with the blood; whereby the braines, the neck, the members, the sinewes, and other parts (which draw that humor vnto them) be nourished, moistened and cooled: wherefore it were not good that the same were wholy expelled by purging. Also Phlegma doth appeare by the slime, matter, snot, spettle, and such like that man a∣oydeth. In fine, all that is cold of nature and moist (saith Galenus) we do call Phlegma, it pre∣serueth also his nature in such proportion, that it is no moister nor colder in the bodie: and al∣though the same be also throughly concocted, yet neuerthelesse doth it remaine alwayes cold, and that not only in the body, but also when it is driuen out of the body with purging medicins, so that it can be warmed by no meanes. This cold moistnes (next to the blood) is the highest estéemed, as it is (because of the foremen∣tioned reasons) most needfull to all liuing creatures. But this is onely spoken of that kind which the Phisitions do call the swéete Phlegma, for that it is of sundry natures, viz. thicke, thinne, and like to molten glasse or gips: that which is tart and sower, is vndigested and crude. The salt waterish moysture or Phlegma when it is putrified, then doth it cause sundry sicknesses, as vnhealthinesse of the whole bodie, cold swel∣ling, sluggishnesse, much sléepe, and head-ach; and especially where it doth abound greatly, then doth it cause sower belchings of the stomacke, the gowt, and disease of the sinewes▪ all which
sheweth that this waterish moysture must be purged, what Phisicke ought then to be vsed to expell Phlegma, is sufficiently declared ouer the whole booke. But for the better satisfaction we will here describe the best of them. First, there is nothing more fit, than that all men that spend their life in daintines and idle∣nes (whereby they do gather much waterish humors) might obserue such an order of diet which might be cleane contrarie to their former life, as you shall finde described in the discourse of the sicknesses which be caused through Phlegma. These be the simple things which consume Phlegma, viz. Penniroyall, Marierom, Nepe, Sage, Marierom gentle, Hyssop, wilde Thyme, Rue, Fennell rootes, Smallage, Parsley rootes, Sperage rootes, Pepper, Ginger, Cloues, Maydenhaire, Hony, Squils, Vineger, and most of all whatsoeuer is warme, and dry by nature. Aloe doth also purge Phlegma; Cassie doth by a secret vertue expell it gently; Agaricus hath power to driue out all slimines, to attenuate the thicke, and to open all obstructions; the hot Gumme Euphorbium is vsed only at the greatest neede; the iuice of wilde Cucumbers Elaterium expelleth waterish humours most forcibly; but it cannot well be vsed without danger aboue the quantitie of foure graines. In like manner also the leaues of Mezereon foure graines, or sixe at the most. The seeds of Palma Christi do some vse to the number of thirtie when they be péeled, but it is verie much: they do purge the Phlegma very well, but with great paine and torments of the patient, for that they do purge vpwards & downewards, and are very hurtfull to the stomack. Now when the Phlegma lieth deepe in the body and in the ioints, then will it by Coloquinte be drawen foorth best of all. The Mirobalani Chebuli, Emblici, and Bellirici, doe purge very mildly, and that chiefly from the head and the braines. The seed of wilde Saffron doth expell all moysture, and especially the dropsie, one quarter of an ounce, or thrée dragmes giuen at one time. Turbith is also especiall good for it, but it is seldome vsed alone, but tempered with other things that hereafter insue, viz. with Sene leaues, Polipodie rootes, Sal gemmae, Stechas, Ireas, Behen, Hermodactyli, Nettle rootes, Ginger, Coleworts broth, Sugar, Hyssop, Agrymonie, Pepper, Hartwoort, Centorie, Hellebor, Pieretrum, burnt Squils, Sarcocolla, Opopanacum, and Sagapenum. Amongst mixed and compounded things which do expell Phlegma, be first these sirupes fol∣lowing, as both the sirupes of Vineger, both the Oxymels, and Oxymel of squils, Oxysacchara, Hydromel, Syrupus de Calamintha, de Prassio, and sirupe of Wormewood; all these do expell Phleg∣ma through the vrine. Item, you haue more in the second part, the fift chapter, a very good po∣tion for the breast in a drie cough, called Decoctio Pectoralis, which doth consume the cold slime. The confection Benedicta, Hiera Picra, Pillulae foetidae, de Euphorbio, Cochiae, sine quibus, de Hermoda∣ctylis maiores & minores: all these do expell and purge. Item, Diaturbith cum Rhabarbaro, and Me∣dicamen de Turbith, and other moe. For a purging potion is this insuing to be prepared: Take Harts toong, Agrimonie, and Maydenhaire, of each one handfull Annis, Fennell séed, Epithymum, Agaricus, Cuscuta, Parsley séed, wilde Saffron seed, Turbith, seed of Smallage, and Sene leaues, of each one quarter of an ounce, séeth them togither in sufficient water: or take Mirobalani Chebuli, and Emblici, of each halfe an ounce, and lay it all togither in a warme place to stéepe: afterwards wring it out, and make thrée potions thereof: then temper of the foresaid sirupe or Oxymell therewith one ounce or an ounce and a halfe, and take thereof euery morning. There is also prepared for it this laxatiue confection: Take Cinnamom, Cloues, and Nutmegs, of each halfe a dragme, Mace, Cardamom, and Lignum Aloes, of each one scruple, Ginger one dragme, Turbith thrée quarters of an ounce, Diagridion thrée grains, Sugar sixe ounces, dissolued in the iuice of Quin∣ces, boyle it to the thicknes of Hony, and then temper the rest amongst it: when it is now al∣most cold, then take thrée dragmes thereof, or halfe an ounce at once: but in hot weather it is not to be vsed, it purgeth Phlegma and Cholera maruellously. These things following be also very good, to wit, conserue of Rosemary, of Sage, confected Ginger, Calmus. and Nutmegs, &c. Item, Treacle and Mithridate one dragme thereof taken otherwhiles. Tysane or Barly pap is also very good. For drinke, is wyne méetely good to be dronken, for that it consumeth slime, and amendeth
all diseases which spring of Cholera: the same doth also Betonie wine, Elecampane wine, the wine of Auence, of Hyssope, of Rosemary, of Sage, and of Wormewood, the Claret wine, and other spiced wines, wherof shall be spoken more at large in the last part: likewise also all vitall and golden waters, the sower iuice of Pomegranates vsed in meate or tempered in drinke, is very good. In the first part, the second Chapter, and second §. be two pectoral potions discouered, which be very méete for it. Now for to vse outwardly, you haue in the first part, the second Chapter, and thirtéenth §. a salue of a rosted Goose, which is maruellous piercing, and consumeth the tough slime. The salue of Roses doth also delay all flegmaticke defluxions. Item, oyle of Cammomill and oyle of Rue annointed on the outside, or vsed with Clisters. Thus much be now spoken of the cold Phlegma; concerning the hote Phlegma, that concerneth the pestilentiall Agues, and other sicknesses which are caused through heate. The 21. Chapter. Of the cold diseases. EVen as we haue discouered throughly in the discourse of the cold Phleg∣ma, what here and there throughout this whole booke hath bene declared to be fit for this purpose, the same shall also be done in the discourse of di∣uers cold sicknesses, of whatsoeuer occasion that they may be caused, as of age, of defluxions of the stomacke, of the Matrix, of the breast, or how∣soeuer the same might be: first of all therefore we will here teach what might inwardly be vsed for them. First, there is good for it the conserue of Eyebright, which drieth the braines. Item, the conserue of Hyssope and of Betonie, of Gilloflowers, of Lauender, of Spikenard, of Rosemary, of Marierom gentle, and of Sage. In like maner also confected Ginger, Calmus, Elecampane rootes, and confected rootes of the greater Pimpernell. The confections be also good which be made of the horse Radish, the Marmalade with spices, both kinds of Treacle, the Mithridate, and confected Annis seedes be also good. Rosemary wine is for this a very forcible and healthie drinke. Item, Elecampane wine, Hyssope and Lauender wine: and for moistnesse of the head is very méete the wine of Asarabacca rootes: moreouer, all other spiced wines, as Hipocras and Claret wine be much commended for it; and if there were any bodie which could drinke no wine, he may drinke common Meade. Oile of Spica is much commended annointed outwardly vpon it against all cold diseases of the braines, of the stomack, of the liuer, of the spléene, and of all the intrailes. In like maner also these oyles following, viz. of blew Flouredeluce, of Beuercod, of Bay, of walflowers, of Worm∣wood, and aboue all others the oyle of Tiles or Bickes. In fine, all that is before described for the cold Phlegma, and in other places for all cold sick∣nesses, may serue for this intent, and so we will conclude this fift part.
The sixt part of this Booke maketh mention of all such sicknesses as are incident to the whole bodie. WE haue treated of many kinds of sicknesses in these former fiue parts of this booke of Phisicke, all which pinch and paine one certaine part of mans bodie, and also sometimes indéede the whole bodie, for that nature hath so knit and combined all the members of the bodie one vnto another in vnmeasurable shape and vniformitie, that as there is any member anguished with paine or any disease, euen then all the other members impart therewith: so that whensoeuer the head, the heart, the stomack, the liuer, or any other suffereth, all the other mem∣bers (one lesse, another more) must be partakers of this foresaid an∣guish, and in such measure are all of them grieued according to the quantitie of the infirmitie. And forasmuch as the Ague is so spread throughout the whole body, that (as it is commonly said) there is not so small a corner frée; yea further (as all famous Phi∣sitions witnes and alleage for an infallible saying and Axioma) that there is no disease so small which bringing with it an alteration of nature, that is without the Ague or Feuer: therefore will we comprehend them all in this sixt part, that thereby we may also detect the noisome Plague or Pestilence which is also a spice of an Ague, and also some other, whereof hitherto in our former parts we haue not sufficiently declared. The first Chapter. Of all manner of Agues in generall. THese very common and manifest diseases are called of the Gréeks Pyretos, that is, firie, and with the Latinists Febris, that is, a seething or boyling, and in our vulgar tongue we name this sicknesse the Ague, that is, a superfluous, hurtfull, and vnhaile heate, that sometimes often, and sometimes more vehement than before commeth againe, and returneth. Or an Ague is an vnnaturall mixture of naturall spirits in a hotter and drier nature than is necessary. And in another place, The heate which diseaseth the whole bodie, we call the Ague. Againe, the Ague is an alte∣ration of naturall warmth into a firie warmth, and therefore is a hote and drie disease. The old Maisters or Phisitions named all such sicknesses Agues, when any stood and complained of griefe without any outward swelling, without the Rose, without anguish, and (to be briefe) without any sore outward. So if there were any that were pained with the stitch in the side, with an inflammation of the lungs, and such like, then had they their speciall names, whereby they account the Ague not to be a particular maladie, but incident and casuall or casum: so that they held opinion none to be right Agues but such where the bad humors in the veines were in∣flamed, and yet the outward members felt not any painfulnesse. And these Agues are of so many kinds, that Hippocrates in describing them in a maner, for∣getteth his old and briefe custome of writing, where he sayth thus: Some are long, biting, and yet mild: other without biting at all, but comming againe: some strong and mightie: other that quickly inflame the bodie: some continuing at all times, are smal and drie: other that bring no manner of belching or vomit with them. Some are full of filthinesse and very ill fauoured: other that take one with moisture and sweate. In like sort they haue many kinds of colours, ruddie, Saffron yellow, and some haue very bleake colours. It is not then a great wonder that the cold with the heate do cease at certaine houres; as at one time it continueth, and at another time commeth againe the third or fourth day, or twice on the third day: so that otherwhiles it hangeth on a bodie a whole yeare, yea sometimes ones whole life long. Any one may decipher
the species of Agues as he will, yet neuerthelesse in truth there be but thrée sorts of mingled Agues, and euen so they come also through three manner of causes: that is, out of Cholera, out of a black and melancholick humor, and out of Phlegma. For euery one of these hath at the first two kinds of properties, as an intermission, at one time ceasing and remaining still, or continu∣ance at all times induring alike, which are deuided into many sorts, and also mingling them∣selues with others, according as the matter or humor is much or little, or more or lesse putri∣fied, and also euen as the places or parts be enclined whence the Agues grow and spring. All such vnnaturall mixtures and Intemperies, whereof we in the first part, in the first Chapter 1. §. and then afterwards in the second part, in the beginning of the sixt Chapter and of the hart, haue briefely written, with those as are needfull to be rehearsed againe, are eight in parti∣cular, whereof the hot and dry mixtures are the most perillous and noysome, which being first kindled in the hart, and then spread throughout or ouer all the whole bodie, are now called the Agues. They are also of this nature (specially the Ague of one day) that if one giue not the patient somewhat to eate, then presently they are of more force and power: for hunger (in this Ague) otherwhiles dryeth the patient so vehemently, that thereby (as in other dangerous A∣gues) he will be so gréeued in his head, that he séemeth to be out of his wit. The second Intem∣peries is almost like to the first, specially concerning the Ague, but that it is hot and moyst. The third, whereas the moysture or the drouth (be it in what kind of Ague that it will) preuai∣leth the one ouer the other, but not superaboundantly, or aboue meane and measure, this is the best. But when this vniformitie is ouerthrowne and broken, then is it best for all vnnaturall mixtures that they be hindered, whereby (as hath béene shewed) they come not to last long. Of like nature is that, that with cold and heate kéepeth a iust meane or temperature: But where the drouth surpasseth the moysture, thereout commeth Intemperies. The fourth is a iust meane, to wit, containing the equall measure in all that hath béene said, yet alwayes inclining a little to the contrarietie. The other foure mixtures are alwayes either cold and moyst, cold, moyst, or dry and cold. For these mixtures of the humors are the very same whence all Agues spring in such a wonderfull manner, that it is not possible for the Phisitions to discerne them, but only quotidians from the tertians and quartaine agues, whereon depend all other mingled Agues, for that they out of this Intemperies do flow as it were out of a fountaine, and are to be easily perceiued & knowne. So that Phisitions when as such Agues raigne, must haue speciall care of these three things; to wit, of the strength of the patient, the occasion of the Ague, and to know the spece of the Ague. But for the better vnderstanding of all these things, we wil briefly declare certaine species of Agues, which Galen hath collected out of many and diuers other wri∣ters, and we will first begin with the very least. The second Chapter. Of the one dayes Ague, called Ephemera. EPhemera of the Gréeke word is that Ague called, which vsually endureth but 24. howres. These species of Agues come only in the veines, where they enflame the vitall spirits, whereof we shall more at large speake hereafter. Putridae Febres are Agues where the humors do putrifie in the veines; amongst which are some that do cease a certaine time, whereof the chiefest are the aforesaid three sorts, that is to say, the quotidian, the tertian, and the quartaine Agues. The quotidian Ague is bred and in∣gendred of Phlegma, the tertian of Cholera, and the quartaine of Melan∣lia, Continua Febris is an Ague that alwayes without ceasing remaineth continually without intermission. Causos of the Gréekes, and of the Latinists Ardens Febris, is called a burning Ague. This Ague continueth always after one manner, vntil that through the health or death of the patient it be ended. It is such an Ague as burneth still after one manner, and is the very hottest of all Agues: it maketh the tongue black and dry, it bringeth great thirst, and desire of cold things. If you will now reade more of this vnnaturall heate, then looke in the first part, the 11.
Chapter. 1. §. where it is in particular described. Emphysodes, that hurteth the mouth through her heat and maketh it full of blisters where∣of it hath this name giuen. Lypiria, this cooleth the patients hands and féete but inwardly the whole body is inflamed, his water and going to the stoole stopped and stayed whereby also cometh thirst and hardening of the tongue: the pulse will be feebled and small, and the naturall heate decayeth, and that no otherwise, than as it were altogether extinguished. Rhoodes, that is as much as a Flixe or Laxe, which happeneth vnto one with great vomi∣ting, cold, shaking, thirst, disquietnesse, and féeblenesse of the pulse. Astringens, that is, astringent or binding, is contrary to the other before mentioned, for that thereby the bodie will be stopped, the vomiting stayed, with a strong pulse, it endureth also long, it wasteth the bodie and maketh it leane. Icteriades, that is, mixt with the yellow Iaundies, for it bringeth them with it. This infla∣meth the Liuer, and drieth the tongue in such manner, that it is terrible to behold: what might be further written hereof, that may you learne in reading ouer the description of the Yellowes. The Pestilent Agues do come with great heate and intollerable thirst, the going to stoole is with much noise and great stench: also the vrine stinketh much: the pulses are so féeble, that one can scant féele them, as shortly shall be written more at large. Languidae Febres, are slothfull Agues, that distemper the head, stuffe the nostrels, stop ye vrine, and going to stoole. Phricodes, that is, when as with the shaking there is a great heate attained, the pulse féeble and scarce to be felt: moreouer, the belly doth swell, with much rumbling and noise, the tongue will be verie moist, whereby neuerthelesse the patient will complaine much of bitternesse and drouth of his mouth. Quotidiana, is the quotidian Ague, that at a prefixed time either in the day or in the night re∣turneth againe. Tertiana, is the tertian Ague, wherewith the patient is one day frée, and is one the third day vexed therewith. Quartana, is the quartaine Ague, which ceasseth two dayes, and returneth the fourth day. Hepialos, is a phlegmaticke Ague, whereof the patient sometimes of cold, and otherwhiles of heate complaineth. Some name this also of the similitude that it hath with the molten glasse Vitrium. Other name it the raw and vnconcocted Ague. Hemitritaea, is the halfe tertian Ague, that is a very strong Ague that neuer ceasseth alto∣gether, but hapneth one day gentle, and the other day harder. Errabundae, are erring and wandring Agues, that kéepe no certaine time nor measure, and these thereby do cause the melancholicke humors to rot and foister in some place of the bodie, which otherwise in another place are not touched or moued at all, wherby all such Agues of ne∣cessitie are ingendred. Hectica, (whereof also commeth Marasmodes) is such an Ague as infecteth the parts of the bodie, like as the Ephemera doth the vitall spirits, and as the Putridae or rotten Agues do the humors. Of this Ague procéedeth the consumption, which not onely wasteth the flesh, but also the marrow in the bones, as we shall hereafter both of this and other Agues declare more at large. These are now the most principall sorts of Agues, and at this present shall these briefe notes suffice. We will nowe procéede with those things that furthermore doe appertaine vnto Agues. Wherefore chiefely it is to be obserued, that euerie one of them by the Phy∣sitions is deuided into foure parts. The first they terme Accossum, which is the beginning of the Ague: thereupon followeth Incrementum, the increase. The third is Status, that is, when the Ague is in the highest degree, and standeth still. The last part is Declinatto, that is, the decrease, or declination, of which parts of the Ague we haue elsewhere more at large giuen intelligence. There hath bene also a great debate amongst the learned, whether men might knowe euerie kind of Ague in one day of fower and twentie houres; some thought that no man could rightly iudge of the Ague before the third day. So that Galen in diuers places derideth them, and confuteth their opinion with many profound reasons. The simple or compounded Agues
(saith he) are easie to be knowne, but the compounded very hardly: yet it is not vnpossible to discerne them in one day. Many agues, and most of all other maladies whatsoeuer may well be knowne, the second, third (or at the longest) the fourth day: for there is no disease that in three or foure daies might not apparantly be iudged: so also are all agues according to the humor into which the bloud is altered, qualified, and do also giue a certaine Ague of their nature. If Phlegma be cause of the Ague, then of necessitie will it indure very long, and longer if it procéed and come of the me∣lancholicke humors: but if it ensue from Cholera, then can it not tarrie long, seeing it doth vehe∣mently wast the same. To conclude, all easie agues are ended in foure dayes: as also all violent agues can kill a bo∣die in foure dayes, which may be séene in the pestilent feuers. Thus farre haue we generally spoken of agues, now will we shew the meanes and remedies for the same, and will first begin with the commonest, and with the best knowne; amongst which the most part of the foresaid agues are comprehended. The least of them all is, the first recited ague, Ephemera or Diaria in Latine, for that the same seldom holdeth the patient (not disorderly eating and drinking) longer than a day, that is, foure and twentie houres, because it is not fixed so fast in the heart, but onely in the Spiritibus vitali∣bus, which we call the Vitall spirits. This ague hath no corrupt or rotten humors that can be incended or can prouoke any swelling of the outward parts. To conclude, this ague is likened vnto a hote ayre that quickly loseth her efficacie and po∣wer. This ague is thus described: Ephemera is an ague wherein the vitall spirits are incended, and so spread ouer the whole bodie without any long permanence. And that is a certaine token of such kind of agues, that they must alwaies haue some cause going before, whereby it is pro∣cured; as namely, wearines, much watching, wrath, great sorrow, and such like vexation of the mind. Item, the heate of the Sun, cold, great labor, drunkennesse, venimous ayre, and heate about the priuities, be it through swelling, or any other occasion, conuersation with sicke men, or those that be diseased in the lights, vse of indigestible meates, and such like. The tokens whereby they are knowne are needlesse to rehearse, by reason that they may be perceiued and knowne of the patient, thereby the better to remedie the same. For amongst all others, this disease is neuer more apparant than in the vrine, and by the pulse: for that in this ague the vrine is commonly higher coloured than accustomed, and the pulse much swifter; as anger also is deformed by his owne pulse. Item, great sorrow, and a disquiet mind haue also their owne signes. Also by what obserua∣tions, and how the Cholera, the melancholie, the Phlegma, and the bloud is knowne: we haue taught in their due place. Those that are troubled with the agues that bréed through any swelling or vlcers, they féele a continuall swift, and hard beating pulse: they are very hote burning with a ruddie counte∣nance and white vrine. And to conclude, they are all commonly Ephemerish agues that haue the pulse equall. And albeit the same sometimes be vnequall, yet is it scarcely to be perceiued very ill to be. These are now the most vsuall and conuenient signes of this ague, which we haue said are very easie to be holpen if men looke vnto it betimes: for being delayed too long, then fall the dis∣eases into agues that are worse, and be of longer continuance: as namely, in Putridas, and Hecli∣s, so that many by negligent delaies fall into their perpetuall destruction. Therefore vse these remedies following for it: first, a bath whereby the pores are opened, that thereby all noysome vapors might exhalate. For when as they are shut vp, or through ex∣terior cold closed together, then must all such infectious humors remaine in the bodie, whence diuers perillous agues are caused. For all those that are infected with the ague through any swelling of the priuities, is the ayre hurtfull either before or after the bath: but aboue all things it is in other agues to be shun∣ned. But if any one will tarie long in the bath, then must he be gently annointed by the hand with Sallad oyle, especially such as got their agues through labor and trauell. The diet of the diseased must be such as may ingender good bloud of a light digesture. Those
that through the heate of the Sun, or by wrath or anger are fallen into this ague, they must vse cooling and moistening things; if through cold, warme things; through watching, sorrowes, and cares, moistening things, and such as will prouoke sleepe. All those that are thus afflicted, may well vse wine that is small or watered; for such is alwaies more fit than water alone, be∣cause it expelleth water and sweat. But in all these points is to be obserued the age of the patient, his strength, his custome of liuing, the season of the yeare, and the nature of the countrey, and such like. All those are forbidden wine, that in this ague procéeding of the heate of the Sun, haue a swelling of the priuities, or of any other part, till such time as all such inflammations be ended: The like also for all such that haue their pores obstructed, and be therewith strout and corpu∣lent of person. All such as through ouerwatching, or through great sorrow are fallen into a small Ague, must after their bathing be fed with moist meates, that are light of digestion, and make good bloud. To those that by reason of long watching are féeble, may the wine be allowed without further regard or care, vnlesse they had much headach, or féele great motion of the pulses in the temples of the head, these common rules must also be obserued in other feauers. All those that get the Ague through wrath, sorrow, or déepe speculation, they may drinke wine well enough: in like manner also the idle headed, but onely when their fit or madnesse is past, before which it is very dangerous to vse the same. This also is a common rule, first alwaies to séeke remedie for all those accidents that are most troublesome, or to take away the cause of the sicknes by his contrarie, as labor by rest; wrath, sorrow, and madnes, with mery and pleasant conceits; watching with sléepe; those that get it through much speculation must wholly leaue it off: euen so must it be with the swelling and inflammation of the priuities, that the same may heale, and the paine be asswaged. Here hast thou briefly set downe, what order of diet and other things are to be obserued in any accident whatsoeuer. Now will we learn you after the briefest maner we can, what things are to be vsed in any of the foresaid causes. When as then any bodie through the heate of the Sun, or through a bath, falleth into an a∣gue, then must you annoint his head with the oyle of water Lillies, Roses & Violets mingled to∣gether, or each alone: you may also make a decoction of cold herbes, or oyle of Willowes, or of any of the foresaid oyles mingled with it: and then let it drop from on high on his breast. If the patient haue great thirst or drought, then giue him to drinke Well water, or Almond milke. When the ague is past, then let him bath as hath bene abouesaid. But if the ague procéede of outward cold, then is sweating good for it: or can he not sweate? then may he vse warme bathes, wherein hath bene decocted wild and garden Mints, Smallage, Fennell, and Parsly, with the rootes. Also annoint the head with the oyle of Dill, of Cammomill, and with oyle of Behen: but he must forbeare the drinking of water. Likewise lay the patient in a méetly warme chamber, an∣nointing his bodie softly, and when the ague is past and gone, then may the patient vse to eate all manner of land fowles, and such like foode. Is he then corpulent and full of bloud? then open a veine, and let him vse in this bath stone Rue, Cammomill, Fennell and Stonecleuers, &c. Or come these Agues through the vse of any hot meates? then vse cold things; as Lettice, Purslaine, and the iuice of Pomgranates. Purge with Cassie, Manna, sower Dates, or with Conserue of Prunes. Take also of the Confection Diatriasantalon, Endiue water, Oxysacchara, Iulep of Roses, Barley water with a litle Vineger, Camfere, Lettice, Purslaine and such like cold herbes, or the iuice of them. If this Ague come of drunkennesse, of strong wine, or such like drinke, then must the patient vrge himselfe to vomit, or to purge with the foresaid cold things. If there be adioyned a great paine of the head, then must you annoint it with the oyle of Roses, or with some iuice of cold herbes. Or if this issueth through great sorrow, feare, flight, ouer much watching, madnes, wrath or such like, then remedie these things as is said, by their contraries; to wit, with mirth, mu∣sicke, comfort, sléepe, and with such like: he must also shake off and forget all causes of sorrow and feare. Likewise this patient shall smell vnto Roses, Violets, and Saunders, and wet clothes in
the muscilage of Fleawoort, and the iuice of coole herbes, mingled with a little Camser, and lay them vpon his head. When the Ague procéedeth of wrath, especially in young folkes, then is the wine to be refrained. These Agues also procéede aswell of exceeding ioy, as they do of great wrath, albeit the same chaunceth seldome; yet it is by the foresaid meanes in like sort healed. These agues may also come very easily through excessiue labor, by reason that the same hea∣teth the vitall spirits. For the same must be prescribed light meates, rest, bathes, measurable sléeping. Or if these Agues be caused of ouermuch sléepe and rest, as often it falleth out, then shall he constraine himselfe to watch, and let his bodie be rubbed ouer with hote clothes. These agues are very subiect to all fluxes of the belly, and dysenteries of what cause soeuer the same doth procéede. For this are all astringent and binding things to be vsed, and to do all that is fit to be done in such like sicknesses. Also Cotton dipped in the oyle of Masticke, or oyle of Quinces, and laid ouer the stomacke: but vpon the liuer and heart coole things. If the patient should thirst or hunger, then shall he vse, and especially at the beginning, Bar∣ly paps, Oaten paps, water bathes, and rest: and for his drinke he shall take water mingled with the iuice of Pomegranates. But if he be cloyed with too much meate, then causeth it light∣ly ague to follow: for which Clisters, purgations and sobrietie are to be vsed: but if there be any sower belchings vpward admised, then vse Diagalanga, or Diatrionpipereon, and annoint the stomacke with the oyle of Masticke, the oyle of Wormwood, or with oyle of Spike, laying shéepes wooll thereon. Afterwards when the ague hath left him, let him vse sléepe and sobrietie. The agues which procéede of any impostumes, vlcers, Pleurisies, puffing vp of the Lights, swelling of the priuities, which is caused of paine, Cholera, heate, and thirst (more than the fore∣said agues are) these shall you remedie thus: first, search out of what humors they grow; if of bloud, then must the patient open a veine, thereby to ease the impostume or any other hote swellings: or do they come of Cholera? then must the patient be purged; and moreouer the vl∣cers or impostumes must be cleansed, ripened, and healed. It happeneth also, that as young children haue the wormes, they also fall into such an ague: for this all such things are to be vsed as are ordained and thought most méete for the destroying of wormes, and especially a salue, beginning thus: Take oyle of bitter Almonds, &c. Thus haue we sufficiently spoken of Diarie agues, and mentioned how they are to be dealt withall. The third Chapter. Of the continuall Ague, Continua, in generall. GAlen termeth these continuall Agues Continuas Febres, which from the first time that they enter vpon a man, indure continually, without intermission, if they be not through health or through death dissolued, al∣beit that otherwhiles they waxe a litle fainter or flower: yet neuerthe∣les sometimes many dayes, yea wéekes, indure still. Of these are chief∣ly twaine, the one that increaseth the third day, which is more perillous than the other: to wit, than those that change their nature ye second day: and by reason of this alteration, the Phisitions do giue these Agues di∣uers names, wherof the principallest is Typhodes, that is, burning, which greatly agréeth with the half Tertian ague. Then is there Synochus, which procéedeth of a su∣perfluitie and inflammation of the bloud mixt with Cholera, taketh hold most of all vpon the bodies of young, temperate and hote persons, wherof we shall hereafter speake more at large. The signes of these Agues be, that 24. houres long their fit continueth, inconstantly beginning and increasing. The pulses of them are swift and hard, the vrine is redder than it was before. These things following are also to be obserued, and well to be remembred, that in drie and hot weather they are few, yet strong and bad Agues do raigne, but without any sweat at all: In wet weather are these agues most rife, and that with sweate.
For so much as these continuall Agues are first of all described amongst hote agues, there∣fore here will we admonish the Reader, that we make this our discourse so much the longer, to the end we might declare the matter more openly: and that such hote agues as hereafter fol∣low, may thereby the better be knowne, and easier cured, and that especially in this §. wherein shall be taught the meanes which are to be kept in meate and drinke, in vomiting, & sléepe, also what might reuiue those that are so diseased, whereby they should be eased in great heate, and after what order they should gouerne themselues, their ague being gone. The Ague that is continuall, Continua. §. 1. THe occasion of all such mightie Agues is the putrifying of the humors within the great veines: and the cause of the putrifaction aforesaid is a stay and detaining of superfluous tough humors that are caried in the bodie, the heate wherof appro∣ching to the heart enflameth the same. This commonly hapneth in all such bodies that are filled with tough humors, or that the veines through heate of the same are ouer dried. This Ague also may ingender of venimous ayre; as in the time of pestilence is to be séene. Item, through great cold (whereby the pores be shut vp) through sore labor in the hote Sun, through much watching, through great anguish, grieuous thoughts, and through a great fluxe of the belly. The common signes of this mightie ague, are paine of the head and great heate (easily to be felt) watching, great thirst, swift and vnequall pulse, red, thicke, and yellowish vrine, the pati∣ent rageth in his sléepe, his senses are troubled, and complaineth of terrible dreames. If he be young, and the season of the yeare be hote, and that he dwell in a high and hilly countrie, then are all these recited signes the likelier to be certaine and true. The order of dyet in time of hot Agues. §. 2. IF so be that these patients desire to be rid of these Agues, then is it very néedful that they haue a good gouernment or order in eating and drinking, & they must haue speciall care to be fed with such meats, through which they may be cooled, the bloud purified and moistened, whereby the heate and drought may be with∣stood. In like manner shall the patient be kept in the beginning of his sicknesse (whilest he is in strength) sober in eating and drinking, and encrease the same according to oportunitie. In like sort with the letting of bloud, if the patient be red in the face, his veins full & young, then is he to be let bloud (in a very hot ague) vntill he fall into a swoune. But if the patient be so weake, that such forcible letting of bloud may hurt him: then let it be done at diuers howers, euery time a little, two or thrée daies together, for some are to be dealt withall more gentlier than other, and require that the Saluatella vpon the right hand (to wit, by the little finger) may be opened, and that there shall about fiue ounces of bloud be let out. We haue before giuen order what kinds of meate this patient is to vse, that the same must be cooling and cleansing the bloud, as Cicorie, and Endiue, with the roots, water Cresses sodden in his meate: and in like sort also a Sallad made of the same herbes and rootes, with oyle and Vineger; and there is chiefly to be put into the same Sallad, Liuerwort (that vseth to grow be∣sides the water Cresses) which is passing good. Also the iuice of Oranges, Pomgranates, or Li∣mons are to be vsed with his meate: and amongst other herbes, Spinage, Béetes, and Tur∣neps, with their leaues are excellent good. Item, Lettice, Endiue, and Parsley, and mingle a∣mongst them sometime a little Marioram, Penniroyall, and wild Thyme, and Hyssope (but once) for that it is warme of nature. Of fruits let him vse Damask prunes, Oranges, & Pome∣granates. And of flesh let him be serued with that of Calues, Hens & Capons, the which are to be brused & eaten with the broth, also make sops with Vineger, mingling ye yolks of egs & Su∣gar amongst it. Item, Partridges, Fesants, field fowles, and such like are not hurtfull: it is also to be noted, that with the flesh is to be sodden Parsly roots, Cicorie roots, & Veriuice, with a lit∣tle Marioram and Hyssope. Moreouer, the séedes of Lettice, Melons, & Cucumbers, are passing good: yet not all together, but somtime of the one, & somtime of the other. Péeled Barly sodden with Hen broth is much set by: and also Hen broth alone, wherin a litle bread is soked.
Item, shiues of bread soked in water, and the water powred out, and afterwards the iuice of Pomegranates powred thereon, and bestrewed with Sugar, is very good meate for all such maladies. Some are of opinion that the flesh of a Magpie, is a certaine good medicine for the Ague: and some suppose that young Magpies with the feathers distilled, and the water of them giuen to the patient to drinke, and it were not amisse, that in the distilling of them, there were put the rootes of Parsley and of Elecampane. For these hote Agues may fountaine water be drunken, or any other cleare riuer water, that hath bene sodden once before, or powred a good while and often out of one pot into another. Or you may mingle with this water iulep of Violets, or iulep of Roses, and so drinke it vnsodden: Barly water is a very fit drinke for al such maladies, & may be mingled with the foresaid Iulep. Wine (though very little) is otherwhiles permitted: and also Sugar water, and sodden Hen broth (the fat blowne off) is very good. Common rules for Agues. §. 3. ACcording to the prescribed ordinance or gouernment of the life, we are to shew in like manner the remedies & cures. But first we will declare certaine rules, which in all hot Agues must be obserued: that thereby for all such maladies a better order may be had & kept. The first rule is, how to discerne easily, that the patient cannot come to his health, vntil the putrified matter of the Ague be pur∣ged away. Secondly, the eyes are to be fixed vpon that matter that ingendreth the ague, that the same be prepared for purging, the ague which is present be corrected, and that which is to come be hindred. Thirdly, whē this putrified matter is to be taken away, then must care be had how to open the obstructions, which are the foundations of the ague, for otherwise there can no good be done. Fourthly, if the Ague be forcible & hot, and the patients strength ve∣ry small to resist ye same, that it is impossible for the patient to tolerate the violence of the ague, then must the patient not be suffered to vse many cold things before, that thereby the naturall heat be not quite extinguished: but if he be strong, & may withstand the sicknes, then cut off the cause, expell the matter, kéepe the patient sparingly, & let him not vse ouer cold things. Fiftly, if naturall strength in the ague be very weake, then must the Phisition strengthen the same, coole the vnnaturall heat, and with méet food comfort the debilitie of the body. Sixtly, ye cooling of the ague is not to be effected with drying or binding things, vnlesse it be when the materiall cause is expelled. Seuenthly, if the nature and qualitie of the ague be doubtfull, then must the patient liue sparingly, & especially when the Ague assaileth, that it may find an emptie stomack. Eight∣ly, all fresh fruit are very hurtfull, by reason that they will soone stinke and putrifie in the sto∣mack. Ninthly, while the patient is in good strength, & hath bloud enough, or is full of humors, then first of all let him bloud, and especially when as his vrine is red and thicke, and when it is doubted, that the Cholera wil get the vpper hand. Tenthly, and if so be (as is rehearsed) that na∣ture be of abilitie, then vse those things first which loose the bodie mildly; afterwards open a veine, and then purge. Eleuenthly, in these kind of agues there is no strong purgation to be ministred. Twelfthly, if by the wambling or paine of the stomack, it be perceiued, that the cor∣ruption falleth into the stomacke, then shall you minister to the patient a vomit: but if through the rumbling of the belly it be perceiued, that the matter be fallen downe into the bowels, then is it to be expelled with purgations. Thirtéenthly, those medicines that might hurt the bowels, be noysome & not commodious, in case that the patient haue not vsed preparatiues before, be it in heate or cold: or in case that the corruption made not the patient starke mad, or that he were in doubt to fall into a greater mischiefe. Fourtéenthly, as the bloud preuaileth, and that a veine must be opened, then is the preparation of the matter to be expected, by reason that the same concerneth the other bad humors, and not the bloud. Fiftéenthly, when the Crisis is neare hand, you must forbeare to minister any medicine. But if the same be vnperfect, then is it to be ayded, and to help nature in that, which she can not performe of her selfe, that is, in strengthening her, and in right vse of the medicines. Six∣téenthly, if the letting of bloud be thought méet, then is the same to be done at the first, for other∣wise it will not do so well; for when the patient is ouer weakened, then might the same be a meane of his death. Seuentéenthly, the patient is to be purged when the Ague is weakest.
Eightéenthly, wine bathes and fomentations are to be abstained in forcible and strong Agues, and rather drinke cold water, which hath great efficacie to coole the heate of the Ague, but not to expell the putrified matter through the pores, or through the vrine. Nintéenthly, when the principall parts of the bodie (as the Heart, the Head, the Lyuer) be strong, and the Ague is vehement and hote, then may you boldly giue the patient water to drinke, yet not if he be in yeares, for those are not very strong of nature. Twentiethly, if there be much bloud, much tough slime or fleame, and binding of the bodie present, then first of all let the patient bloud, afterwards attenuate the matter, and lastly open the pores and warme them. One and twen∣tiethly, aboue all things haue regard to the strength of the patient, and if he be strong enough and that he haue neede of purging, then is the same to be executed without any care: But if his strength be small, then let it alone at any hand, except it be some gentle thing, and after that he be somewhat strengthened. Two and twentiethly, if in the Febris putrida be any ob∣struction, then héede is to be taken to open the same, the which if it be caused of some humours, then are they to be euacuated. If those humours be tough and grosse, attenuate them. And if the Ague be mixt, then prepare your medecines accordingly. Thrée and twentiethly, because the cold attracted ayre penetrateth to the heart, and other inward parts, let him thereby be re∣freshed, opening all manner of windowes about him. Foure and twentiethly, it happeneth o∣therwhiles, besides the grieuousnesse of the disease, and the presence of diuers accidents, that sometimes there are those things giuen to the patient that are hurtfull for the Ague, as in the swounings in the Ague, for the which of necessitie Wine and fresh broth are to be giuen to the patient: wherein is to be considered, that the greatest extremitie is first to be eased. Fiue and twentiethly, if néede require that much bloud or humours are to be taken away, and that the strength of the patient will not abide it, then must the same be done by little and little at diuers times, and not at one time, euen as is before expressed at large. But if the strength of the patient will permit it, then is it to be done at once. Sixe and twentiethly, in these forci∣ble and vehement Agues must the Phisition be prouident and warie, how to expell and purge: for it is better to leaue one part of the matter in the bodie, then to expell it all at one time. Se∣uen and twentiethly, the Phisition must alwaies be hold and liberal in comforting the patient; for although healthfull meates bréede some inconuenience, yet are they better then too much abstinence. Eight and twentiethly, minister alwayes vnto the patient for his mouth such things as will kéepe his throate moist, that through great heate it drie not too sore, the which is accomplished by the muscilage of Fleawoort, the iuice of Pomegranates, the muscilage of Quince kernels, by Purslaine and Licorice, which things also are good for to quench thirst. Of common things for hot Agues. §. 4. AFter the description of the common rules (which are to be noted) wée will nowe treate of this, namely, when it is found, that an Ague doth approch, then must the patient take fowre ounces of the water of Carduus Benedi¦ctus. Item, take the rootes of Cicorie, cut them, powne them, and wring out their iuice, drinke a spoonfull thereof halfe an howre before the Ague assayleth: but it is to be noted, that the inward heart of the roote is to be taken away. Or take pow∣ned rootes of Cicorie, as many as you thinke good, and powre Wine thereon, boyle them in Balneo, and then drinke thereof three or fowre times, to wit, morning and euening: it is also passing good for such as are swollen with the Ague: Cheruell water is very good to driue away the Ague. A maruellous water of the auncient Phisitions: Take a spoonefull of Fennell séedes, and as much Salt, powne them together: and let it runne through a Cearse or hairen Sieue, then take good Vineger, and the vrine of a man child, about sixe ounces of each, giue to the pati∣ent thereof thrée or fowre times, to wit, when the Ague beginneth to assaile, and haue regard that he vomit it not vp againe. This do all the Phisitions vse, but hereafter follow many bet∣ter and fitter things. Out of the foresaid things easie it is to be noted, that for all hot agues these waters ensuing
are passing good, as water of Endiue, Cicorie, Burrage, Cuscuta, Sorrell, Maidenhaire, and such like. All Aguish diseases may fréely vse these sirupes, or any of them which one listeth, as sirupe of Vineger, of Veriuice, Violets, Cicorie, with Rubarb or without, of Citrons, Roses, Endiue, or of Sorrell. Item: Syrupum de Iuiubis, de Byzantijs, Acetosum compositum, de Radicibus, Oxymel, and Melicratum, and if there be not much Cholera abounding, then vse the Honie of Roses, which is good for all Agues: take thereof which you will, and mingle it with the water of Ly∣uerwoort, of Endiue, and Fumitorie, Sorrell, or with the water of Maidenhaire, and such like. Of these confections following, you may vse which you please, as Diarrhodon, Trisantali, Tro∣ciscos de Spodio, cum Semin Acetosae, de Eupatorio, de Berberis, powned, and mingled with any of the foresaid waters, and drunken. And the whay of Milke is chiefly commended. These are the meates that an Aguish bodie may well and commodiously eate and vse. Of the lothing of meate in them that be assayled with the Ague. §. 5. FOr as much as in all hote Agues the appetite of féeding is taken away, whereby nature is suppressed and waxeth faint, and thereby scarce able to resist the Ague; therefore it is very requisite that herein good counsell be had and taken. For this you find in the third part, the eleuenth chapter, and ninth §. what is to be done herein: likewise you may vse for it any of these things ensuing. Take Conserues of Roses two ounces, confected Citron rinds, sirupe of Apples as much as you thinke good; mingle them together, and vse thereof fasting at each time halfe an ounce. There is also a confection or compound, that is called the Kings sauce, the which is very good to prouoke appetite, and the same is to be made with Sorrell, Cinnamom, Cloues, and Vineger. Others make it of Vineger, Sorrell, Fennell, and Parsly. The third sort, take the iuice of Parsley, Sugar, and Vineger. Item, one may compound sirupe of Vineger with Oxymel. In like sort there is good for it both the sirupes of Mints. After meales it is very good to vse prepared Coriander séede, Annis séedes, and Almonds confected. Item, Cinnamom, Marmalade, Conserues of Roses, and honie of Roses, rosted or baked Peares are also excellent good. Euery such patient is to be outwardly annointed with the salue of Saunders on the place of the Lyuer, and on the Kidneys, with the cooling salue of Galen. This water here next follow∣ing is also very soueraigne to be vsed thereto for the washing of the féete. Take Sage, Cammomill, and Bayberries, of each a handfull, Marioram halfe a handfull, Citron rinds, and Orange pils, of each halfe an ounce, a pint of strong wine, and common Ley, as much as will suffise: let them all séeth together, and vse it oftentimes, for it will prouoke appetite. For the thirst in hote Agues. §. 6. BEcause continuall Agues prouoke great thirst, therefore we will not cease to giue some knowledge and caueat how the same may be holpen and remedied, the which will be effected with Barley water, and with cold and moist things, and also with such losinges as be prepared & made with the muscilage of Flea∣wort, the muscilage of Quince kernels, and with Dragagant. Sugarcandie, and the kernels of Pomegranates, are also very often to be v∣sed, and he shall receiue the cold and moyst ayre. Before in the third part, the twelfth Chap∣ter, 10. §. there are also diuers things declared, being all very good to slake or quench the thirst. Item, take sirupe of Violets one ounce, Barly water thrée ounces, Cinnamom water one ounce, oyle of Vitrioll three or foure scruples, mingle them together, they will become a red po∣tion with a tart or sharpe tast; but because there are other more pleasanter things, do I coun∣sell you to leaue out the oyle of Vitrioll.
Of purging and such like. §. 7. ANd for the expulsion of this matter or corruption in the best manner, thereto is very soueraigne washt Aloe which is described in the Introduction. The com∣mon plague pils be also passing good for the same, the which pils are called de Tribus, and are to be mingled with Rubarbe. Also once a weeke at the least, let the patient take in some cooling and laxa∣tiue medicine: as namely, conserues of Prunes, and Cassie, the which are good in old maladies; and therefore is commonly to be giuen an ounce and a halfe, with halfe a drag. of Rubarbe. Manna is excellent good for it, and the confections of Diamanna cum Rhabarbaro, the which are to be had in all well furnished Apothecaries shops. There are some that giue counsell (and that very well) that the next day following the patient is to take thrée ounces of laxatiue sirupe of Roses mingled (if it please him) with some distilled water. Also there is good for it the losinges de succo Rosarum, Diaphoenicon, de Psillio, & Diacatholicon: or vse this potion fol∣lowing: Take sowre Dates one ounce; breake them in Cicorie water, and straine it through a cloth. This done, mingle Cassie and conserue of Prunes, of each halfe an ounce, halfe a drag. of beaten Rubarbe, and fiue graines of Spica amongst it. Take this in the morning early, and thereupon fast afterwards sixe houres. There are also cooling clisters vsed for it which the Phisitions do call Lauatiua (that is, clean∣sing Clisters) by reason that they are for none other purpose, but to strengthen the bowels, to make them slipperie, and to warme them, as these ensuing: First, take Barley water and Su∣gar, or broth made of a shéepes portnance, wherewith is mingled fresh Butter, or Hogs grease, otherwhiles Béetes, and Mercurie. Likewise there are many clisters of Sallad oyle, and oyle of Violets, and also (in the paine of the belly) of Linseede oyle without putting any other thing thereto, but twelue or sixtéene ounces taken at one time for one clister. And when the going to stoole and vrine are to be prouoked, then vse thereto fresh broth that is most common and fit, wherein Barley is sodden and is mingled with oyle. Or if you will haue it stronger, then take an ounce of any of these confections mingled amongst it, as de Sebestis, Hiera, Diaprunis, Cassie, Thomas Sugar, oyle of Violets, Hony of Roses, or of Violets. For the vomiting in the Agues. §. 8. ALl that lie of hot Agues may easily be brought to vomit, and that chiefly after their taking of any medicine, and to preuent it, looke into the third part, the 20. chap. 7. §. For the losse of Sleepe. §. 9. THey that are plagued with the Agues are easily barred from their naturall sléepe, and to further the same, looke into the fift part, the 18. chap. where is sufficiently treated what hereto belongeth. For to releeue them that be sicke of the Ague. §. 10. FUrthermore, there are many things that reuiue these patients whereby their heauines (that procéedeth from the heate of the Ague) might be cleane taken away: to wit, that fresh linnen and shéetes be giuen often vnto them, their beds often rowzed and made, also set in their sights glasse bottels filled with faire water, put often faire water out of one pot into another in the presence of the patient. Vrge him to smell often to a glasse filled with faire water, Rose water, and good Renish wine, and giue them Pomgranats, Oranges, and Rhenish wine to suck vpon, and especially before meate. Let their hands and face be often annointed before and after meate with some pleasant odoriferous things.
For the releefe or comforting of the sicke. §. 11. THese kinds of hot maladies require also, that somtime the diseased haue somwhat giuen them, whereby the naturall spirits may be reuiued, quickened, strengthe∣ned, and cherished. Therefore it is requisite that we write somwhat thereof. Hereto is very soueraigne the black confected Cherries, red and dried Cherries with the Conserues of the same, and all that may be made of Cherries. The confected Muscadell peares, with or without wine, according to the qualitie of the Ague are passing good. Item, conserue of Berberries, and the sirupe of the same, are also very good for it: And in like manner all that may be made of Raspes. Item, Conserue of Buglosse, of Burrage, and of Roses, each apart or mixed together. Sugar of Roses melted in Well water, and so drunken, is also passing good for the same: and in like manner the Sugar of Manus Christi. Some vse for lauing a shiue of bread soaked in Rosemarie wine, for that it strengtheneth and quickeneth appetite; but it is better for the cold than for the hote Ague. If so be that the patient do get blisters in the mouth, or the toong furre, and the throate do burne, as chanceth oftentimes, then looke into the first part, the thirtéenth chapter, and second §. where you shall find very good remedies for the same. Ordinances for all those that are recouered of a long sicknesse. §. 12. NOw if it come to passe, that sicke folkes begin to amend, and the disease weare away, the breath beginneth to be frée, the paine to cease, the sléepe to come, and haue lust and appetite to their meate, then may be fréely said, that the patient beginneth to recouer: then is the patient to be kept very sober in his diet of ea∣ting and drinking, and not féede vpon any other meats then are requisit for such like diseases, like as Barly grout, Currans, & broth wherein the roots of Parsly and Cicorie are sodden, for that all these things do strengthen and moisten. There must also be vsed outwardly for the strengthening of the stomacke, oyle of Mints, of Masticke, of Worme∣wood and of Spica. You may also make a salue for the stomacke, with the foresaid oyles, being mingled with Cloues, Nutmegs, and Cinnamom, and with a little molten Waxe. Item, the plaister of Masticke, and other plaisters mo, that are specified in the description of the stomacke, are very good for it, being laid on the stomacke outwardly. Concerning the pati∣ents binding of the bodie, you may vse any cooling things, specified in the third part, the ele∣uenth Chapter, and 20. §. Aboue all the rest that is spoken of before, for the recouerie of all diseases, it is passing good to alter the place or situation, especially to draw neare to the mountaines or hils, whereas it is drie, and far from the sea, and from all noysome and stinking lakes. Aromaticum Rosatum doth strengthen wonderfull much. The fourth Chapter. Of the halfe third daies Ague, called Hemitritaea. THis is also a kind of continuall ague, ye which is one day slacker than an other, & appeareth in ye outward members, at one time with great heate, and another with great cold; therefore must you haue daily care to mark how it taketh one, and what humors there be that do raigne most of all in the same Ague, that there may the better order be taken for redresse thereof; like as in the beginning of the continuall agues, and hereafter shall be taught in the description of the Quotidian, Tertian, & Quartain agues. The mixture of these agues is of Cholera and Phlegma, for which
cause it is ioyned halfe with a tertian, and half with a quartaine ague, whereby groweth a cō∣tinuall ague. And when the Cholera getteth the vpper hand, then is the tertian the more stron∣ger: and when there is most of the Phlegma, then is the quartaine the mightiest. So that when they are both o equiualent efficacie, then it is onely called Hemitritaea, that is, when both these humors do worke equally, and haue their operations alike. There is for the heate of these agues giuen commonly to the patient Barly water, that is sod with Melon séedes, Gourd séedes, Endiue séedes, and such like. For the cold, is Pepper, Cinnamom, and Annis séede, and the Wormwood much praised, especially Oxysacchara, be it of whatsoeuer humor this ague doth procéede. The fift Chapter. Of the tertian Ague. LIke as we haue in the former chapt. made mention of the tertian Ague, and haue numbred the same amongst the hote agues (whereof we now do speake) so doth our methode now require to adde these and all other hote agues vnto them. This ague doth alter her selfe into many kinds of sorts and species, according as it mingleth it selfe with other agues, which oftentimes happeneth. But if this Ague remaine in her owne propertie, then do the learned call it Exquisitam, and Legitimam, that is as much to say, as neat of it self and vnmingled: and it is such a kind of Ague, wherein the propertie of the person, his age, the time of the yeare, the state of the bodie, and the whole former order of diet do agrée one with a∣nother, and accord with the humor which causeth this Ague. This exquisite tertian ague com∣meth not aboue seuen times, and it is wholy without perill. The second sort of this Ague, they terme Tertianam Notham, or Spuriam, that is as much to say, as a bastard tertian Ague, whereof we will speake and declare hereafter apart. Now to speake of the right nature and propertie of the tertian Ague, they are commonly subiect vnto it which are cold of nature, and of a middle age, because that in them the Gall most aboundeth: also in Sommer time when the Cholera raigneth, there happen many hote and burning Cause∣nes, whereof we shall hereafter make mention. This tertian Ague raigneth most in hot dry countries, in hot dry dwellings, and in hot ayre. All bodies that do labor sore in the Summer, watch much, liue in great sorrow, are nourished with subtile meates and such like, are most subiect to these sorts of Agues: as also all they that vse too much Phisicke, they that are hote and drie of nature. And although all species of the ter∣tian ague (as also the Exquisita) are the very hottest; yet haue they neuerthelesse with the ague Causone this difference, that the foresaid tertian ague forceth much gall with the bloud into the veines, and there inflameth the same. To be briefe, these are called Tertianae exquisitae, for that they come vpon the third day, expel∣ling the Choleram through vomits, going to the stoole, and through sweate. And whereas none of these foresaid things appeare thereby at all, then is it to be called only Tertiana; for that the same thereby onely differeth from the Exquisita. For when this tertian ague maketh apparance which continueth many howers, to wit, the whole space of the tertian Ague, the which remaineth continually 28. 30. 36. or 40. howers, the same do the learned terme Tertianam extensam, that is, a lengthened or extended tertian Ague. In like manner they terme that Tertianam duplicem, which is mingled with the quotidian Ague. Item, Hemitritaeam whereof we haue declared before, and many mo that we omit for breui∣tie sake. It commeth to passe that all Tertians approch with a greater and with a more trembling cold, & haue commonly this nature that they do not continue long, nor yet (as is also said) kéepe not their fits aboue seuen times. And if there be any that giueth her occasion by some ill diet yt
the same continue any longer; yet doth she alwaies alter her owne nature into another ague, the which may be preuented through good gouernment of life. The occasions of this ague are partly declared before, to wit, sore labor, or great exercise, and that chiefly at hote times, long vse of things that increase the Choleram, and inflame the humors, as Garlicke, Pepper, and all that is drest therewith, also Ginger, and fined strong wine, and such like. The signes of the very true tertian ague are these, when it doth assaile you with great sha∣king, and cold, which is more violent in this tertian, than in any other ague. Afterwards the heate followeth vpon it, a strong swift pulse, and drouth of the toung, and of the whole bodie. The patient féeleth a pricking ouer all his bodie, as if he were prickt with nailes: the vrine is red as fire, & you may perceiue the heat by the feeling: there is great dis∣quietnesse with it, and no sléepe at all; yet without any paine in the head, vnlesse it be not an ex∣quisite tertian, but a mingled ague. Also if there be any great thirst, madnesse, and frowardnes with it, there commeth a sweat in the end vnto it: and these signes are the more surer, if the pa∣tient be young and cholericke, in the Summer time, in a leane bodie, and that hath liued very continently, and is much inclined to vomit Choleram. It is first to be considered, that all the common rules that we haue before collected in descri∣bing the continuall ague, are also very requisite herein, as these rules following shall further declare. First, the exquisite Tertian or third dayes ague that procéedeth of red Cholera, must be well moystened and cooled. Secondly, for as much as the Cholera is the hotest and dryest humor of the bodie: therefore it is requisite that it be expelled which is fallen into the stomacke by vomits: and that which falleth downe lower, is to be expelled and purged by going to the stoole, be it by potions or clisters. Thirdly, all moistening meates are very good, except such as putrifie quickly in the body. Fourthly, the recouerie for this and all other putrified agues consisteth herein, that all putri∣fied humors must be cleane purged out, and the vnnaturall heate quenched: for if in the exqui∣site tertian, the corruption be lesse than the heate, then the more diligence ought to be had for to coole the same, than for to purge the humor. Fiftly, if the patient be much bound in bodie, then is he in the beginning to be opened and loosed with moderate clisters, that the bad humours may be somewhat expelled and dimi∣nished. Sixtly, because all fruites are hurtfull for all agues, therfore they ought to be forborne. Seuenthly, two or thrée howers before the ague commeth, the patient is to eate somewhat; and likewise also when the ague is departed. Eightly, when by the preparatiue medicines the humor is made to vanish a little, and to be concocted (which may be perceiued by the vrine) then is it high time that the same be purged, and that by that way whither it most inclineth. Ninthly, if after the assault of the ague, and after the departure therof there followeth sweat, then must the same be suffered to take his course, vnlesse that some swouning, or such like acci∣dents are feared. Tenthly, at the beginning of the ague the patient must shun drinking and sléeping, to the end that the humor thereby be inclosed in the bodie, and that the drinking hindreth the vomiting vp of the humor. Eleuenthly, the letting of bloud is neuer good for the third daies ague, before that the patient haue had it thrée or foure times. Twelfthly, there are no Mirobalans to be giuen to the patient at the beginning of this ague, because they purge at the first, and afterwards bind the bodie. Thirtéenthly, he ought also to be secluded from Diagridion; for it inflameth. Fourteenthly, he must not take any sower thing with any thing made of Barly, for that the one spoileth the other, albeit either of them by themselues are commodious. Fifteenthly, Rubarb purgeth Choleram, but it warmeth somwhat, and leaueth a heat behind; therefore the same is to be taken in the water of Endiue. Sixtéenthly, if it be perceiued that there do any hote vapors ascend into the head, they are forthwith to be withdrawne, by a moderate Clister, thereby to draw them downewards, and
to strengthen the head, that it receiue not them so spéedily. And to come to the cure thereof, it is requisite that we make some mention of such things as are declared in the foresaid rules, which I hope shall neuer a whit mislike the reader. This is the opinion of all expert Phisitions, & the nearest way, and aboue all other (so far as is possible) to coole and moisten the bodie; for because this Ague is hot and drie, therefore must it be cured and corrected with contrarie things, to wit, with cold and moist things. When as the Cholera lighteth in the mouth of the stomacke, then must the same tho∣rough vomits be expelled: but if it descend, and fall into the bowels, then must it be purged downward, albeit the nature of an exquisite Tertian be such that it commonly expelleth the same of it selfe, either by sweat, or by vrine. The Cholera is also lightly to be purged downward, and that through a mild Clister, whereof there be diuers described before in the third Chap∣ter, §. 7. And if so be that néede require any stronger, then take of the foresaid decoction twelue or six∣téene ounces, mingled with Benedicta laxatiua, Cassie, and course Sugar, of each halfe an ounce, confection of Beuercod two dragmes, Sal gemmae one dragme, Sallad oyle, and oyle of Sesamum of each one ounce and a halfe, mingle them all together, and exhibite this Clister at least an hower before meate. For the prouoking of vrine, there is a potion to be made, wherin Smallage or Dill hath bin stéeped. If you would vse stronger, then looke in the third Part, the eightéenth Chapter, and the first §. &c. When as the humor is purged through Clisters, and is expelled through the vrine, then do some famous Phisitions giue counsell, that the patient should open the Saluatella vpon the hand, and afterwardes to purge him with mild and cooling medicines, as hereafter fol∣loweth. Take sower Dates and Cassie, of each a quarter of an ounce, Rubarb one scruple, Whay of milke thrée ounces: mingle them together, and drinke it, and fast sixe howers after it. Take of the decoction of fruites, called Decoctio fructuum, foure ounces, stéepe two dragmes of Rubarbe in it all a night; early in the morning wring it out hard, and mingle therewith two ounces of Manna, one quarter of an ounce of Diacatholicon, take it fasting: but of the Diacatholi∣con may you take more or lesse, according to the abilitie of the patient. There are moe such like in the description of the continuall ague. After purging, let him drinke fiue or sixe daies one after another, of this potion following: take Oxysacchara one ounce, sirupe of Violets halfe an ounce, water of Sorrell, and of Cicorie, of each one ounce and a halfe, and mingle them together. But when as you perceiue that the corruption beginneth to be concocted, then may be giuen to the sicke bodie without feare the iuice of Wormwood, drest in this manner: Take the highest sprigs of Wormwood, powne them to pap, and then straine out the iuice: and afterwards take euery morning hereof a spoonefull, and fast two houres after it: so do also at nights two houres after supper. Some vse to stéepe the Wormwood in Melicraton, and drinke thereof. This following is an especiall medicine, for the griefe in the stomacke of Cholera, to wit, to vse often bathing in fresh water, for thereby is the Cholera wasted, cooled, and moistened, if the same be vsed twice a day, & he may remaine therein so long as it liketh the patient, but it must alwaies be vsed with moderation, and at oportune times. Secondly, he must obserue such an order of diet, wherby the Cholera may be auoyded, wher∣of is sufficient mention made in the description of the Gall and Stomacke. But briefly to expresse the meaning of Galen, which is, that in Tertiana exquisita such gouern∣ment is to be kept, that the patient drinke no wine so long as the disease indureth: but the dis∣ease being cleane gone, that then wine is first to be taken watered. All cold and moist meates are perfect good for this maladie, wherewith the patient may che∣rish himselfe as long as he thinketh méete, and as his stomacke can digest them. Amongst all greene herbes, these be good: Orage, Blites, Dockes, Mallowes, Lettice and Gourds. Likewise also Barley paps, and all riuer fish: and amongst fowles, let those suffice as haue soft flesh, and of other the wings onely. Item, all wood fowls, the brains and féet of hogs, rere sod Egs, and especially the yolkes be better than the whites.
He may vse all fruites that are not hard of digestion: but he must forbeare at any hand Ho∣nie, Mustard, salt meates, and all hard meates. All this hath Galen left behind and described for a diet in the mixed tertian ague. Here is to be noted, that at all times the patient shall eate at least foure or fiue howers be∣fore that the ague approcheth, that it may find an emptie stomacke: and in like manner he shall not eate vntill two or thrée howers be past after it. The sixt Chapter. Of the counterfeit and bastard Tertian, that is, a false third dayes Ague. THe third daies Ague which the Latinists tearme Notham Spuriam, that is, a bastard Tertian, is so called, by reason of her due cause which pro∣ceedeth not of méere Cholera; and because that the Cholera is mixt with Phlegma, so that both of them are conuerted into one kind of humour. And the difference of them which is betweene the late described Hemitri∣taea and this Notha, is that the first appeareth in the beginning with two kinds of humors, and the Notha commeth with one onely, and hath but one kind of putrifaction of two seuerall humors. The signes whereby this counterfeit tertian may be knowne from the exquisite tertian, are these: First, this Notha (as is aforesaid) is not exquisite, but mixed. The exquisite tertian com∣meth not aboue seuen times, except the patient or the Phisition haue committed an errour, whereby it is continued. And the bastard tertian heateth not the bodie so greatly, and all the symptomes are not so vehement as accustometh in all other Agues: for this Ague lasteth longer than twelue howers, and otherwhiles remaineth two moneths, specially in old phlegmaticke persons, and that in winter season. These signes also following do manifest how to know the difference betwéene it and the right tertian Ague, to wit, that the humor or matter of this Ague departeth not so soone, and abateth not the bodie so quickly, neither doth this Ague end with such a sweate. These are the common rules to be obserued for this Ague: First, euen as this counterfeit tertian Ague differeth from the right tertian Ague, so require they seuerall kinds of cure. Se∣condly, as the same is mixt with Cholera and Phlegma, so must also the medicines that serue for the same, be mingled, and must be both digestiues and purgers. Thirdly, for that the sirupe of vineger doth attenuate Phlegma, and doth digest Choleram, therefore is the same very commo∣dious to be vsed for it. Fourthly, because the same Ague commeth not so spéedily to the state or highest, the patient may eate and drinke moderatly, least for want thereof he lose his strength, and may expect the state of the Ague. And to speake farther hereof, it appeareth plainely, that touching these Agues, the old pro∣uerbe may be verified, wheremen vsually say, the Ague hath thrée deadly enemies, namely, pur∣ging, fasting, and letting of bloud: which three in truth do not only gall these bastard tertians, but also all other Agues. But in this Ague, whereof we haue spoken, which is not so exquisite and pure as the former, there must be regard taken that the sicknesse increase not, lest thereby the sicke persons be quite ouerthrowne, because (as aforesaid) there are two sundrie kinds of impediments at hand, it is scarce possible therein to kéepe a meane: yet specially is abstinence good, that the more the same is vsed, so much the more will the sicknesse be discussed and spent, but the same féebleth greatly the strength of the patient: for how much the greater it is, so much the more doth it abate and weaken the patient. But to the contrarie, the more that the patient séedeth, so much the more doth the maladie increase, wherfore speciall care is to be had, that that be alwaies done or left vndone which is most requisite and profitable, so that in strong natures the abstinence, and in weake good nourishment be prescribed, which not onely in this, but in all other maladies is to be specially obserued and kept. In this counterfeit and mixt tertian Ague, at the first the patient is not to bath, but onely when it beginneth to abate; and the patient must not haue euery day meate to eate, but e∣uery
other day, and must kéepe himself quiet, couer close his breast, & otherwhiles vse a Clister. Item, for purging you must take halfe an ounce of Cassie, Diaphoenicon two dragmes and a halfe, and whay of milke three ounces mingled together. For a preparatiue of the humor vse this potion following: Sirupe of vineger one ounce, Syrupum de Eupatorio half an ounce, min∣gle them together with water of Sorrell, of Cicorie, and of Fennell, of each one ounce; drinke it off in the morning fasting cold or warme: this is continually to be taken, till his vrine begin to waxe paler, and certaine small cloudes be perceiued in the bottome. Afterwards, let him take these things following: Take Cassie prepared with Cicory water three ounces, Rubarb and Agaricus, of each one scruple, Spica of Indy, and Ginger, of each foure graines, decoction of Melons, Gourds; and Citruls three ounces, mingle them together with the rest, and so giue it him warme. There is also to be vsed for these Agues, letting of bloud, and that at the very beginning. The whole ordinance or gouernment of diet must not be cold nor moist, as is said of the right Tertian, but must be such that it warme, digest, and open. It is also very good to dresse all his meate with Parsley, Fennell, and such like things, and his Barley pappes with some Pepper. Item, let him vse Hony water, wherein Hyssop, Marioram, and Spikenard hath bene stéeped or sodden. Also all things that prouoke vrine (except such as warme and dry too fast) are pas∣sing good, and likewise Syrupus acetosus compositus. If you desire mo other things, then looke what is before written thereof. And you must not faile, but to giue euery seuen dayes once to the patient for this ague the iuice of Wormwood. Oxymel is also passing good, and especially that which is made of Squils, which openeth all obstructions. Some also accustome to giue for these species of Agues, Mithri∣date or Treacle, according as the same is ouer hote or cold. To conclude, vomit after meate is so requisite for all aguish persons, that thereby onely many are fréed and holpen. Some will haue many things to be vsed for this Ague, as there be many wil giue counsell thereto, when all meanes and waies haue bene tried, then take two ounces and a halfe of the salue of Poplars, and mingle it with Cobwebs, and so lay them vpon the pulse thrée howers before the ague cometh. Some bind it vpon ye pulse before the Ague cometh with Cinquefoile, Item, take a handfull of Eidern leaues, Lauander, and Salt, of each a little, mingle them well together with Sallad oyle, and so lay it vpon the pulse, this should also driue away the Ague. The seuenth Chapter. Of the burning Feuer, called Causon. OF this Ague is rehearsall made amongst other Agues in the first chapter of the sixt part, that it is (like to the right Tertian Agues) the hottest of all other Agues, euen as we haue also said in the fifth Chapter, in which two places her properties are expressed: for the obseruation therefore of our accustomed methode, we will here shew and rehearse somewhat thereof. First, this Ague is thus described: Causon, that is, a burning Feuer, is a very forcible and continuall Ague, and procéedeth of a red Cholera, which putrifieth and enflameth in the veines neare the heart, in the lyuer, and in the mouth of stomack, or about any part of the bodie. The occasions thereof are somtimes the very hot time, great labor that is done in the heate of the Sunne, hot meates, wrath, inflammation of the ly∣uer, and of the bloud in the veines, and other causes moe, that are rehearsed in the two places aforementioned. The signes of the same Ague are a continuall heate, and neuer ceassing burning, and that ra∣ther inwardly than outwardly, with many mo terrible accidents: also, there is great drought of the tongue, which at the first is yellowish, and afterwards burnt and waxeth blackish, with great thirst, without any sweate (if a Crisis be not at hand) the pulses beate fréely, the eyes are hollow, the appetite faileth vtterly, and the water or vrine in this ague is flerie, and yellow of colour: yea, it chaunceth otherwhiles that hearing, séeing, and speech is taken away by this Ague, with a great binding of the bodie.
In these perillous Agues that commonly make a dispatch of one in foure, fiue (or at most) in seuen daies through death or health; these common rules following are to be obserued, and also all those that are herebefore noted in the third Chapter, and the third §. First, hasten to expell and mitigate the humor. Secondly, when the vrine is yellow, or yellowish, and the pulse slow, then must you not let bloud; for that the Cholera thereby will be the more inflamed, because the moist bloud which delayeth Cholera, might thereby be drawne out. Thirdly, if the vrine be red and thicke, and the pulse strong and mightie, then first of all must you open a veine. Fourthly, if it do séeme that it is good to let bloud, then must it be done at the first: for after∣wards it is not allowable, lest that thereby great féeblenesse, yea death it selfe be procured. Fiftly, when the heate is almost past, then are you to giue the patient to eate and drink spa∣ringly; yet in such measure, that the naturall strength be not thereby too much enféebled: other∣wise force the patient (although against his will) to vse cooling meates. Sixtly, you must also giue the patient oftentimes cold water to drinke, and let him suffer no thirst. Seuenthly, when his nose or any other part happen to bléed during his sicknesse, then must you spéedily staunch the same, that he lose no manner of strength thereby. Eightly, that the hote damps of this Cholera may not ascend into the head; the same therfore must be cooled with the oyle of Roses, Vineger, Saunders, and with Rose water. And when as the patient cannot sléepe at al, or happeneth to fall into any frenzie, the same must be cured with méete things, as may be found out in the register. Ninthly, first of all must this Cholera be expelled (be it by vomits or stooles) and séeke after∣wards to coole the great heate, which cannot more conueniently be done, than that there be suf∣ficient cold water giuen vnto the patient to drinke. Tenthly, euen as before we haue expressed, these diseased are commonly much bound in the belly, which must be preuented the first or second day with mild clisters. Eleuenthly, the patient must also haue a drinke giuen him wherein Prunes & sower Dates haue bene sodden: also héed must be taken that he go twice or thrice a day to stoole. Twelfthly, the heart must be comforted (which is inflamed with this heate) with cooling cor∣diall waters without all delay. And these are the common rules which are to be obserued in this burning feuer. Concerning his order of diet, his dwelling place should be coole, airie, and be sprinkled with water and Vineger. His head must be set with Vine branches, Willow boughes, and other coole gréene things: for the same do coole and altar the ayre, that by the lungs is drawn towards the heart, whereby the heate of the heart is chiefly cooled. Secondly, euen as is expressed in the third rule, if the patients vrine be red and thicke, then must his Median or Basilica be opened, and the same day or the day following must he vse these medicines following, thereby to preuent all terrible accidents of the heart. Take flowers of Burrage, Buglosse and Violets, of each halfe an ounce, twenty or fiue and twentie Prunes; séeth them all together in sufficient water till the third part be sodden away, then take thrée or foure ounces of this broth, and put therein Cassie and sowre Dates, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Rubarbe stéeped in Endiue water halfe a dragme: afterwards giue it to the patient early in the morning. Item, to coole and to prepare the humour, make this sirupe: Take great and small Endiue, Lettice, Purslaine, Agrimony, Liuerwoort, sprigs of Poppie leaues, and gréene Maiden haire, of each a handfull, Violets, Waterlillies, Roses, and Lens palustris, of each one ounce, séedes of Lettice, Endiue, Purslaine, and of small Endiue, of each a quarter of an ounce: séeth them all together in sufficient water till there be eightéene ounces remaining, then put as much Sugar thereto, and let it séeth againe and clarifie it: put thereto Eiue water, Rose water, and the iuice of Pomegranates, of each sixe ounces, burnt Iuorie, red and white Saunders, Camfere, and white Poppie séedes, of each a dragme and a halfe: then afterwards seeth them all together vnto a sirupe, giue thereof foure times in foure and twentie howers tempered with Barley or fountaine water. And when you perceiue the next day that the ague is abated, and thereby make shew as
though the fourth day it would end; then must you not giue the patient to eate (but as necessity requireth, and as the fift rule sheweth:) crums of white bread soaked in fountaine water are good for him. Likewise Almond milke is also good for him, if the same be made with Melons or Cucumber séedes. You may also mingle amongst his drinke sirupe of Vineger, Muscilage of Endiue, of Purslaine, and Melon séedes: and in like manner the sirupe of Poppie heads, and chiefly of black Poppies. But in case there light vpon any young patient any intolerable thirst, and thereby longeth to drinke cold water, then must you let him haue it, and that so much as he may drinke vp at a good draught: and then afterwards if the thirst and heate yet continue with the patient, giue it him once againe to drinke. But note that old folkes haue not any such drinke. Secondly, good héede must be taken that none of the principall parts thereby be damni∣fied: but onely let such haue it as it is meete for. Thirdly, it must not be giuen at all if the ague procéede of any cold humor. Fourthly, it must not be ministred when the naturall strength is much decayed. Fiftly, if there be no great obstruction at hand. Sixtly, if the sicknesse be not in∣creasing, but decreasing. Seuenthly, it is not tolerable, vnlesse the thirst and the lust to drink water be very extreme. Eightly, if there be any feare of any great féeblenes, then must you min∣gle that water with the iuice of Pomegranates, or with Veriuice, Hen broth, wherein Lettice, Purslaine, and Cucumbers are sodden, is also very méete for him. Item, raw Butter milke well sugred and with crummed white bread in it, is maruellous medicinable. But if there come any sweate, then must speciall care be had that the patient con∣tinue in it, and sweate as long as his strength will abide it. With the bloud must be dealt as is said in the eight rule. The eight Chapter. Of the Ague which is called Synochus. AMongst all other continuall Agues is this also comprehended, which the Gréeks call Synochus, wherof we haue also spoken before in the third cha. that the same groweth through the superfluitte of the bloud, being min∣gled with Cholera. The learned describe two manner of these agues; whereof the one is prouoked of the bloud that is not putrified & the other sort of a putrified and noysome bloud in the veines. The cause of the first ague is, if the partie be by nature sanguine and full of bloud, and there∣withall vseth daily meats that ingender much bloud: as namely, good de∣licate flesh and wine, yolkes of egs, and such like, litle or too much, lacke of exercise, vapors of superfluous and ouer hote bloud, that draweth vpwards and neuer findeth any issue; because the pores and all inward passages are obstructed. The signes of this ague are, when the pulse doth beate a like strong and swift, if the heate be not extreame, then may it best of all be percei∣ued in the palme of the hand: the vrine for the most part is like vnto that of healthfull persons, yet the same is often red and thicke, and specially in a corpulent bodie. Herewith may appeare also a rednes of the bodie, and of the face, with a fulnesse of the veines, and there is no cold nor shaking, but a troublesome breathing: otherwhiles they fall into a dead sléepe, as it were into a Lethargus, whereof we haue spoken in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, and tenth §. Before that any do fall into this ague, he féeleth first a great wearisomnesse ouer all his bodie, and an itching of the nose, ach of the head, and in his sléepe he séeth many red and bloudie fantasies: a∣boue all this the spéech is troublesome vnto him. For this bloudie ague are described these rules following. First it is the opinion of all lear∣ned Phisitions, that all such patients are to be letten bloud euen vntill they begin to fall into a swound. Secondly, if it appeare very waterish and cholericke, then must the same be cooled and thickened. Thirdly, if the same be too grosse and too thicke, then must the same be mad subtile and thin. Fourthly, the bodie must after letting of bloud be well frothed, that the pores may be opened. Fiftly, when as the letting of bloud is neglected (and the patient yet strong enough) then the same is to be done still, yet at all times with the counsell of a learned Phisition. Sixtly, if the patient will not abide letting of bloud, then must alterating, penning, & expulsiue things be vsed, wherby the superfluous humor & bloud may be abated. Seuenthly, the letting of bloud and drinking of cold water worke and effect so much, that you néede not vse any other things.
Eightly this Ague requireth great abstinence, if nature may abide it. Ninthly, when this Ague procéedeth of surfeting in meate, then must the letting of bl not be vsed before the 2. or 3. day: notwithstanding that the malady is such wherin the opening of a veine may not be omitted, for that it quickly annoieth; wherfore must the first rule be forth with applied, by letting him blood in the Median so long til he begin to swonne. And if the same cannot be effected at one time, then is the same to be done at sundrie times, euery time a little. Afterwards let the patient vse cooling things, as namely, sirupe of Veriuice, of Purslaine, of Pomegranats, and of Limons, or of Sor∣rll: much cold water is also to be giuen to the patient to drinke, yet with such direction as be∣fore in the description of the Ague Causon hath bene shewed. Let him haue bread to eate that is stéeped in the iuice of Pomegranates or Veriuice. Barly water is the most commodious drinke that he may drinke, and sirupe of Roses may be mingled amongst it: if he go not to the stoole, then make him a chicken broth wherein Mallowes are sodden. Purge the patient also with sower Dates, with conserue of Prunes, Cassie, or with Manna, and so procéed with cooling things till the heate be cleane extinguished. Of the Ague Synochus, with putrified blood. §. 1. THe other sort of this continual Ague is also very strong, procéeding of a putrifactiō of the blood. And hereof is a disputation also amongst the learned: for some say that when as the blood commeth for to putrifie, that then it is no longer blood, and there∣fore this Ague Synochus cannot be ingendred of blood. The causes are the same that are of the other, but that onely with the former there are many inward vapors without any putrifaction of the blood. In like maner the signes of both these Agues are the same, but that in the first the heate is greater, & all other symptomes more violent than in this. In fine, herein do they both agrée, that there is neuer any increasing or abating of the fit, as may be ob∣serued in other continual agues. Now to cure this ague, the patient must be let blood out of hand, if the stomacke be not ouercharged with meate, and that the age and the strength wil permit the same and therupon purge, as is taught for the former ague. And if it fal out (as it accustometh to fall out) that with this ague there were adioyned a féeblenesse of the liuer, then must these Trociskes following he prepared for it. Take burnt Iuorie, Dragagant and starch, of each a dragme, séeds of Purslaine one quarter of an ounce, Licorice one quarter of an ounce and one scruple, make thereof then Trociskes with Dragagant dissolued in Endiue water; they do coole and comfort the stomack, and also the liuer. Another. Take two scruples of Roses, two scruples and a halfe of Berberies, séeds of Melons, Cucumbers, Citruls, Purslaine and burnt Iuory, of each a scruple, Dragagant, Gum, and Al∣monds, of each half a scruple, Rubarb, Saffron and Camfere, of each seuen graines; make thereof Trociskes, and minister one dragme of them at once with Barley water: you may also mixe the aforesaid Trociskes with conserue of Roses, and so vse them. For this are also commodious the losinges Diatrionsantalon, Diatragacanthum frigidum and that for both sorts of these Agues, because both of them do aske one and the same kind of remedies. Of the order of diet. §. 2. BOth of these Agues do require a sparing diet, as Barly pottage, Oaten paps, Hen broths, wherein Lettice or Veriuice is sodden, and such like. One may also seeth Lentils by powring out the first broth therof, and dressing the second with Parsley and a little vineger, or iuice of Pomegranates. The broth of red pease with sugar, stewed apples, peares, and fresh Gourds drest with Almond milke, are speciall good. He may also eate otherwhiles Melons, Citruls, Endiue, Let∣tice & Purslaine. But if the patient be bound in the body, then may you séeth in the Almond milk Spinage, Mercury, and such like: or take conserue of Prunes, sower Dates, Cassy and Manna, of which you will: also mild Clisters may be vsed and taken for this purpose. And if the patient haue great head-ach, then delay the same with oyle of Roses, vineger, or with Oxyrrhodino. In like maner may you also vse a little oile of Violets, or oile of water Lillies
being dropt into his eares, and to hold Roses, Camfere, or Saunders before his nose. If the pa∣tient cannot take any sléepe or rest, a that no lithargy be feared, then is the iuice of cold & moist herbes to be vsed, and in like maner of small & great Mousléeke, of Nightshade, Lettice, Purslain, and of Poppie leaues, or Poppie heads, Poplar salue, and such like, dip a cloth therin, and lay it vpon his forehead. The very best and most vsual drinke that can be vsed in this sicknes is barly water; but in great heate you must mingle therewith (as is said) the iuice of Pomegranates or veriuice: Item, cold water with sirupe of Pomegranats, or any other cooling sirupe. And if there chanceth any swouning called Cardiaca with it (wherof we haue admonished in the second part, the sixt Chapter) then is the same to be holpen with cooling and fragrant things, euen as hath bin shewed in the foresaid places, and especially apply this plaister following to the liuer, Take red, white and yellow Saunders, of each thrée drag. Roses and Barly meale, of each one ounce, Camfer a quarter of an ounce, make a plaister therof with Rose water. If so be that he fal into a great sléep, then must you chafe the hands and the féet very vehemently with vineger, pouring the same also vpon a hot stone, that the vapor thereof may ascend into his nose: You must also cal earnestly vpon him, pul him by the haire or by the nose, and vse such like things more for the same, as be shewed in the first part, the twelft chapter, & 10. §: for whenas these vapors do ascend forcibly into the head, then is the dead palsey to be expected. Whereas is vnquenchable thirst, there must the water be mingled with vineger, & hold these losinges following vnder the toong: Take the iuice of vnripe Grapes, of Sorrell, of Lettice, wine of Pomegranates, and white vineger, of each an ounce, put thereto white sugar and sugarcandy, as much as is thought méet, letting it séeth so long together as shall suffice to make losinges of it. Here is now sufficiently intreated of this Synocha, and of other hot Agues. The ninth Chapter. Of the Quotidian Ague, Quotidiana. THe cause of this dayly Ague procéedeth of a putrified Phlegma, and slimy corruption, which nature forceth towards the exterior parts of the bo∣die, and there ingendreth such a cold, which may be called rather a sha∣king than right cold, wherwith it so burtheneth and suppresseth nature, that thereby the pulses are faint, and vnnaturall heate stirred vp, and the pulses are found vnequall. Whenas the cold auoideth, then by and by followeth the heat, which is shorter than the cold, continueth longer because of her slownesse, and by reason of her toughnesse; whereby this Ague commeth to her state very slowly, and declineth very sodainly: so that it hapneth therein as if one lay gréene wood vpon the fire, where the moisture withstan∣deth and suppresseth the heate, and remaineth so long without burning till all the moisture be consumed, and then sodainly burneth away as long as there remaineth any wood. The occasion of this Ague is outwardly cold and moist aire, the long vse of cold and moyst meate, as fish, fruite, and such like, and vnaccustomed idlenesse, to bathe much in swéete waters, and great rioting. Item, if the body be ouercharged with ouermoyst and slimie humors that putrifie in the bo∣die, go out of the veines, and send stinking vapors towards the heart, whereof an Ague might ensue. This Ague is also very easily by her signes to be knowne from the Tertian Ague, for it be∣ginneth not by and by after the first day with cold, but beginneth by little and little: also the pulse altereth not, as it doth in the tertian Ague. The patient complaineth of no great heate, of no short breathing, neither of any great thirst. His vrine is like vnto the vrine of such as haue new gotten the quartaine Ague, not knowing of any sweat at the beginning, but in time doth he perceiue it: so that these signes are so manifestly differing from the tertian Ague, that they seeme to haue no communion at all. Also, one may perceiue by this patient that the heate is somewhat mixt with a vapor, which appéereth outwardly: also the pulses of this Ague be much fainter than the tertian or quartaine agues. The toong is moist, and he is quickly prouoked to vomit, wherby he casteth vp much filth:
and in like manner is the going to the priuie cold by nature, moist, vndigested, waterish, and full of vapors. The vrine is white and thinne, and otherwhiles thicke and troubled, and the whole body full of waterish humors. All bodies that liue in quiet, are fat and moist, haunting dayly riotousnesse and surfetting, much bathing in fresh waters, and such as haue their habita∣tions néere to moist places, are most of all subiect to this disease. To conclude, this ague long enduring is not without perill of life. Now to remedie and cure this Ague the better, you must aboue all obserue these rules follo∣wing: First, this patient is to vse that which warmeth and attenuateth the humor. Secondly, if the patient can hardly cast or vomit, then it is a signe that the tough phlegme of the stomacke must be incided. Thirdly, you are in the beginning of the Ague to force the patient to vomit, whereby the matter or humor might partly be abated. Fourthly, these inciding and attenuating medicines must be vsed from the beginning to the very ending of the maladie, yet now and then, as the Phisition thinketh méete. Fiftly, all kind of Agues in the beginning do accord with these thrée things, to wit, that the nature be brought through easie meanes to be laxatiue, to prouoke vomit, and moreouer to vse such things that do incide and attenuate the matter, and expell vrine. Sixtly, forasmuch as the debilitie of the stomacke and of the liuer is an occasion of many fil∣thy humors, therefore néede requireth that you séeke to comfort and open the same, and also the spléene. Seuenthly, for that this Ague from the beginning till it come to the highest state, requireth much time: therefore you are to consider of the patient accordingly, and to giue him much or little meate. Eightly, one must in the beginning of the Ague, and likewise as often also as it assayleth, kéepe the patient awake, and that so long til it begin to decline, that the expulsion of the humors be not thereby hindered. Ninthly, he is not to be fed so long as the fit of the Ague endureth, but a good space before, and afterwards, vnlesse that some debilitie and weaknesse require the contrary. And how these A∣gues are by medicines to be cured, that is before in the fift part, the twentith chapter sufficient∣ly taught and expressed, whereby euery one may gouerne himselfe: and especially these pils here following are to be prepared for these phlegmaticke Agues: Take the rinds of Mirobalani Che∣buli, Rubarbe, Cinnamome, Cardamome, and Cloues, of each a dragme, Aloe thrée dragmes; beate all these together very small, and with the iuice of Mints, wherein a dragme and a halfe of Agaricus is stéeped: then make pils thereof, and euery morning and euening take halfe a drag. at once. You are also to receiue a potion that is described in the third part, the twelfth chapter, begin∣ning thus, Take Gentian, &c. You are generally at the first to vse alwayes for these Agues Oxymel, and other things moe that prouoke vrine, as hath bene taught in the third part, the eighteenth chapter. This patient is also to vse none other meate than such as doth separate the tough phlegme, and expelleth it. In like manner when the Ague is at the state, then must care be had for the mouth of the stomake, like as there are therefore diuers medicines ordained in the description of the stomack in the third part, the eleuenth chapter. Vomiting is for these Agues passing good, for thereby will many slimie humors be expelled: And how to prouoke vomit, you may search and find in the first Register. The tenth Chapter. Of the Quartaine Ague, Quartana. WHen as these Quartaine Agues are mixt with other Agues, then hath she her beginning of Melancholy, as the Quotidian Ague of Phlegma. And because the blacke melancholicke blood hath his residence in the Milt, it will commonly be felt in the same place at the beginning. This ague is (as her cause is) cold and dry. Albeit the same humors are very grosse, cold, and heauy, yet doth their cold nature
not appeare forthwith, to wit, in the beginning, or the first day, but by little and little, as it in∣gendreth: so that the cold (when the Ague is at the highest) doth not otherwise shew it selfe, than it doth vnto such as are stiffened by extreame cold in the hard winter: and it is to be like∣ned by a stone, muskle, or bone, which lying in the fire and being hot, you cannot well know the heate till you feele it. So fareth it also with melancholicke humors, when they happen to kindle, then remaineth there no moisture till they be cleane burnt: and therefore are they the longer before they kindle than any other, for that (as is said) the corruption commeth to kindle by little and little. By the foresaid occasions it commeth to passe also that the pulse beateth very slow, faint and longsome, yea in yong folkes so very faint, that they may be likened to old folkes: for as this A∣gue beginneth to increase and attaine to the highest, then will the pulse be the more swifter and forcible, yet not so strong as it is in the Tertian Ague, whereof we will further write and make mention. The causes of this quartaine Ague are (euen as abouesaid) first the melancholike blood, time of the haruest, and after that the winter, for that at these seasons these humors are not onely stirred, but also augmented more vehement and durable, so that otherwhile they endure vntill winter; whereas to the contrary the same are shorter in Sommer, and the rather, if the na∣ture of the countrey be inclined that way; and the time of the yeare otherwhiles is such, that it ingendreth foule bloud, whereby then such and other Agues are caused. Wherefore good héede must be taken to all these foresayd things: and in like manner whether the patient be not of a melancholicke nature, and hath not vsed before to eate such kinds of meates, whereof this me∣lancholicke blood is ingendred or increased, as bread of Millet, Lentiles, Beanes, Chestnuts, salt chéese, salt fish, Béefe, Hares, Harts, Cabbages, and such like. Item, all other things that inflame the blood, as Garlicke, Cresses, pepper, Mustard, strong and spiced wines, burnt wine, and all kinds of hot spice or fruites; but especially great labour, trauell in the heate of the Sun, long anger, great sorrow, and long former Agues, whereby the bloud and other humors are burnt and putrified, and are altered by the great heate into Melancholiam before they be expel∣led, whereof you haue further instruction in the description of Melancholy, and of the sto∣macke. Item, haue speciall care whether the Milt of the patient be not swolne, or haue any other in∣firmitie. Or whether the patient haue before had no erratick Ague, for that the quartaine Ague neuer commeth alone, but commonly alwayes after another Ague. You must alwayes mark wel, whether the vrine be white, thin, and waterish; in these things, as also in the pulse and cold doth it altogether differ from the tertian, but regard not you the vo∣miting of the gall, for that is the onely nature of the tertian ague: but if you find by the motion of the pulse or otherwise, after that the Ague is gone, or if there be any signes of the ague, then is there no doubt at all but that it is a quartaine ague. Now to cure this Ague, we will first of all shew you certaine rules: and for the first, if the pulse be forcible, and beateth swiftly, the water be red and grosse, the patient be yong and full of bloud, then shall you not omit, but open the Basilica or Milt veine on the left hand: but if the bloud be red and cléere, then stop it againe; but if it be thicke and black, then let it runne, and that so long as the parties strength be able to beare it. Secondly, if so be that the patient haue not much blood, let him then not bléede at all. Thirdly, you must not giue to any that is taken with the Ague any strong purgation at the first, by reason that all melancholicke humors are very tough and grosse, and the same may not be purged in the beginning, but mild purgations must be vsed, and gentle Clisters. Fourthly, all meates and drinkes that are prepared dayly for the patient, shall be laxatiue, that he may alwayes haue some vacuation. Fiftly, against such time as the Ague approcheth, the patient must at any hand refraine foode, that nature thereby may worke the better on the matter of the Ague, also the easier expell and withstand it. Sixtly, he may not bathe vntill the Ague begin to decrease. Seuenthly, he must forbeare all fruites, by rea∣son of their grosse moisture that lightly doth putrifie, and may prouoke obstructions. Eightly, these patients must take héede of the cold aire, and settle themselues in temperate dwellings. Ninthly, they that haue any obstruction in their veines, are to vse such meates and drinkes that warme and moisten. Tenthly, because that this humor is compact, and the state thereof a great while after it beginneth, the patient is not to be kept ouersparingly, but let him be cheri∣shed
with meate, that he may retaine his force and strength, and expect the statum of the disease. Eleuenthly, for this kind of sicknes you must not giue him any ouerhot and dry things, for feare that the ague be not thereby doubled, prolonged, and altered into a continuall ague. Twelftly, you are not to vse ouercold remedies, because they do thicken and harden the matter, wherefore uld meanes are alwayes to be vsed and taken. Out of these foresaid rules it is easily to be vnderstood, that no strong medicines are to be vsed in the beginning of this Ague, except one sée that there is great store of blood at hand, at which time the Median may be opened in the right arme. Also if the blood be blacke and thicke, as it happeneth to be of such that haue a diseased spléene, then may one let it runne the longer; but if it be red and cleane, then must it be presently stopt. The ordinance and gouernement of his life must be such, that he feede not vpon any thing that prouoketh or bréedeth wind, but vse all meates that ingender good blood, and kéepe the bodie open and soluble: and if any defect be hereof, then must a mild clister be ministred. Also, he shall forbeare swines flesh, and all meates that are slimie and hard of digestion, and of all that which might make the body cold and drie. His drink must be thin white wine, his meate all maner of field fowles, but no water fowles, fish of light-digestion, and not slimie, salt meates and mustard may he also vse. Also he may some∣times vse the confection Diatrion pipereon or Diaspoliticon: and although the patient did drinke e∣euery day a little pepper with water, it were not amisse. This patient shall not wholy forbeare from riding, from walking, and from baths, if he hath bene accustomed to it, yet is the bath not very good for him. If this quartaine ague be not very strong, nor yet continue long, then can it not hurt, if the patient vpon his frée dayes do execute his affaires and businesse. But about the time as is sup∣posed that the Ague is come to the highest state, then must the patient féede very moderatly, yea more sparingly than euer before, keeping himselfe very quiet, and annoint the belly with such things as may keepe the body open and soluble: and also vse such things as prouoke vrine, wher∣of you shall find good instruction at due time and place. And as soone as one perceiueth that the humors begin to auoid, then are those things to be vsed that expell melancholy, and that not once, but as often as néede shall require. Also to prouoke him to vomit, and that after meate, and (if néed be) let him take a little black Hellebore therewith to ease and further the vomiting. But they that cannot vomit must be purged; Treacle is also passing good for them: yet it is to be noted, that none of these foresaid things may be vsed before the sicknesse be at the highest, for thereby might of a single quartaine ague be made a double; and lastly of a double quartaine a thrée double ague. Galen writeth (out of whom this counsell is gathered) that he knew a Phisition, who (before the quartaine was at the highest) gaue his patient Treacle, wherby the same ague so increased that he died thereof. When as this order hath bene obserued in this ague, then do the later Phisitions teach that these things following are very fit to be vsed. Take Ginger one ounce, cut it small, and then séeth it in red wine vntill there remaine fiue ounces, then mingle therewith one ounce and a halfe of Iulep of Violets, and so drinke it, to wit, two houres before the Ague commeth vpon you, and the same will make you sweate thoroughly. Item, take an ounce of the iuice of Plantaine two howers before the fit of the Ague appro∣cheth, it will remoue the Ague. The water of Carduus Benedictus, or the herbe sod in Wine and drunken, cureth the Ague. The common people take the pouder of this herbe and strow it vpon a shine or twaine of bread that is soked in burnt wine or Aqua vitae, and so eate the bread before the ue come. Oxymel scilliticum compositum openeth all obstructions in the quartaine and ter∣tian Agues. Some commend the wine of Asarabacca rootes, for this roote hath the nature of the Helle∣bore, it drieth all inward parts, and prouoketh vrine, and will therefore also expell the Ague. The like vertues are ascribed to the wines of Harts toong, of Hyssope, and of Tamariscus. The sirupe of Oxysacchara is also passing good.
The eleuenth Chapter. Of the Consumption or Ethicke Hectica. THis is one of the most perillous Agues that may light vpon a man, for by her hot and drie operation she drieth vp all natural moisture of mans body. This Hectica is not satisfied with the hurt that it doth to all natu∣rall moisture and vitall spirits, but it drieth also all nourishing parts, and all the flesh of the whole body, yea the marrow of the bones also, so that it may duly and rightly be called the consuming Ague. This destroying heate beginneth first in the heart of the Ague, which is termed Causon, that is, the burning Feuer, whereof we haue written in the seauenth Chapter, which continueth there so long vntill it consume the very sap and moisture of the heart. And albeit that it doth not consume and waste all the moisture of the heart, yet doth it burne and spoile the same. For it fareth with the heart as with a wicke in a lampe, that at the beginning doth burne bright and cleare; but the longer that it burneth, the harder, and the more burnt, the drier it waxeth, where by a little and a little it loseth light and extinguisheth: and albeit more oyle be poured vnto it, yet burneth it not then the brighter, but the flame remaineth small and slacke, and the longer that it burneth the darker it is, till at the last all of it goeth cleane out of it selfe. So fareth it also with this He∣ctica, with or without an Ague, as plainely may appeare in very old men, which are commonly said to die like a lampe or candle. This is to be noted also in children, that sometimes also vse to abate and fall away. This Consumption, namely that which is without an Ague, is called of the Gréekes Ma∣rasmodes, that is, a Consumption; and of the Latinists Senectus, that is, old age, whereby we may call it the infection of the heart, whereof we haue spoken in the second part, the sixt Chap∣ter and ninth §. In like manner in the description of the Consumption, in the fifth Chapter, and 22. §. When this Hectica spreadeth her selfe ouer all the whole bodie, drying it altogether vp, then is it (as we haue already told) called Marasmodes. This sicknesse is incurable, and aboue all mens helpe, for that the naturall heate would quickly like a trée (through very great age, or in them that lie about the fire) through extreame heate be dried away. The causes of this Hectica, are all outward things, which do heate the parts of the body, whereby many Agues might be prouoked, whence at the last this consumption is sounded and springeth. Item, the hunger and thirst, if they be not remedied betimes, the which for the most part happeneth to cholericke and leane men, who falling into a quotidian Ague, are thereby lightly turned into a burning, and lastly into this Ague Hectica. Item, the perishing of the lights may very well be a cause of this Hectica, whereby is hinde∣red that the fresh aire may not coole the heart sufficiently: and there be other moe occasions, whereby the heart may be inflamed. We will now admonish somewhat of her signes. They that fall into Tabem. that is, into a consumption, are easily to be discerned; for before that one come to féele their pulses, one may sée how their eyes be sunke and fallen into their heads. The apples of their eyes will be drie in this agonie and wrinkled, and the flesh round about the eyes fallen away, so that one may otherwhiles almost see the bones of their browes. It séemeth also otherwhiles, that these diseased persons face is so bedusted with drie dust, as it is in them that haue gone the whole day through the dust in the heate of the Sunne. Also the liuely ruddinesse and colour ouer all the whole body is vanished and gone: and likewise the skin of their forehead so hardned and shrunke, that they séeme to close their eyelids very badly; and sléeping, they lie with their eyes halfe open, which can be no due sleepe, but rather an ouer∣great
watching, and the flesh in the temples of the head doth so wast away, that there séemeth to be a great hollownesse. To conclude, there remaineth no more than the very skin and the bones, so that when one seeth them naked, he would iudge none other than that the carkasse were co∣uered with a drie skin, and that all the intrailes are taken out, or lie hid in the breast: and when as one toucheth the skinne and plucketh it hard, then shall he find it through drie, and it seemeth that by plucking it will follow. These sicke persons haue a hard pulse, and at the first touching of them doth one perceiue small heate, but when you hold your hand long vpon them, then may you féele the heate vnder your hand increase, and diuers such like signes more. Of this maladie Hectica and Tabes is a great disputation, whereof here we will not make many words, but will commend that matter to the learned: yet neuerthelesse before we come to the cure, we will briefly admonish thus much, that such as be of a moist nature in the begin∣ning of the consumption, are not assailed with this Ague Hectica, but they onely that be drie of nature, and somewhat hot, and therewith do great labour, watch much, and liue in carefulnesse, whereby their naturall moisture is wasted and spent, these presently are taken with this Ague Hectica, and specially such as chafe much, liue in extreame sorrow, or frequent great heate. And although this sicknesse when it hath long endured, and is once rooted into the body, be thought incurable, yet neuerthelesse men must not disdaine the helpe and meanes which God the Lord hath ordained for the vse of man, but pray hartily vnto him that he wil blesse them for the glory of his holy name. Wherefore these rules following are to be obserued and imitated, for thereby may be gathe∣red a perfect cure of this sicknesse. First, it is néedfull for the languishing persons that they vse all things that may moysten and coole. Secondly, because these diseased persons must neither be purged nor warmed, therefore the warme bath is also hurtful, for thereby the heate is increased. Thirdly, al their meate and drinke must be cooling and moistning, or at the leastwise temperate, as barly pap, Ptisana, henbroth, and Panada. Fourthly, the curing of this Hectica is like to that in the drouth of the stomacke, whereof we haue written in the third part, the second Chapter, and seuenth §. yet are cooling things hereto required, by reason of the great heate of the Ague. Fifthly, if néede require that other meates are to be ministred vnto him which are not cooling, as namely Wine and fresh broth, yet neuerthelesse therewith are cooling things to be vsed. Sixthly, if the Ague proceede of any impostume or bruise of some other part, then must speciall regard he had for the healing thereof, and that the liuer be cooled and brought in good course. Seuenthly, a good coole aire is one of the principall helpes, and therewith fresh linnen also that is washed in water, where Roses, Willow leaues, or Trocisci de Camphora be steeped. In like maner Rosewater is very commodious for it. Eightly, the smell of Campher, Rose water, fresh Poppie heads, Roses, Saunders, and such like, is very requisite and profitable for this patient. Ninthly, all cooling plaisters (wherein no astringent things are intermingled) are to be layd on his brest. Tenthly, if this diseased person desire to haue health then must he (so far as is possible) incline himselfe to sléepe, and to all quietnesse and rest, and keepe himselfe from thirst, hunger, pensiuenesse, anger, hatred and much sorrow. Eleuenthly, he must not sleepe vpon any thing but a mattresse. Twelftly, it is also maruellous good for this sicknesse to sléepe by the noise and rush∣ing of waters, or by springing fountaines. It is very good to hang vp all gréene things about his bed, or to sprinkle his chamber with the water wherein such herbes are or shall be sodden. Thirtéenthly, Goates milke or Asses milke, whereof that is best of them that are fed in a medow where coole herbes grow, is a most soueraigne medicine for this malady. Fourtéenthly womens milke surpasseth all other milkes. Fiftéenthly, buttermilke is likewise very good for this sicknes. Sixtéenthly, to conclude, for consumptions are all manner of milkes from the beginning to the ending thereof very excellent good; and all good fresh henbroth sodden with Lettice, Purslaine and veriuice, is excéeding profitable for the patient. But aboue all things, speciall care is to be had that he obserue and kéepe a good diet, where∣fore he is to eate and drinke but little, vsing alwayes such meates as do nourish wel, to wit, Fe∣sants, Partridges, yong Quailes, and such like, as hens flesh, Veale, Mutton and Lambs broth, &c. wherein Lettice, Purslaine, and such like cooling herbes are sodden. And as we haue declared before, let him vse alwayes Goates milke or Asses milke, and aboue al, womans milke: for all these are so highly commended for this disease, that it is not possible to tell of any thing that may excéed them, to helpe and cure this malady. For if he vse any of these,
or any other good milke, yet in such measure that he be not cloyed by taking too much thereof at once, but to take it the oftener, and namely, betimes in the morning méetly warme, or when it is new milked, and that about two ounces thereof at once, and then afterwards in the day time foure times more, about three or foure ounces at once, so that fiue draughts be taken within 24. houres. His meate must be (as is sayd) Barley pap that is drest with fresh broth, and pap of starch, or that is made with grated bread, and wherin also one of the foresayd herbes are sodden, some∣times one of them, and sometime another. Pease broth wherein hens or any other thing is sod∣den, or of it selfe, is passing good. The very best drinke for this disease is Barley water wherein sugar pennets is dissolued: and to retaine the patients strength, you are to permit vnto him thin white Wine, that which is very cléere, being mingled with faire water, when he sitteth at meate: but the mealtide being past, let him drinke nothing but barly water. They that are quelled with this maladie, haue for the most part alwayes a very drie mouth, drie toong, and great thirst, whereto prepare these confections following, and hold them in his mouth to refresh the same therewith: Take the séedes of Fleawort and Quince kernels, of each thrée ounces, steepe them seuen or eight houres together in luke-warme water, presse out the muscilage, put thereto afterwards the iuice of Pomegranates two ounces, sugarcandie one ounce and a halfe, starch as much as is méete for to make it in forme of a confection. If you will haue it to drinke after the maner of a Iulep, then leaue out the starch, and put thereto the water of Purslaine and of Citruls, of each eight ounces, and so let it séeth a little together; and lastly clarifie it with the white of an egge. If one hold gréene Lettice or Purslaine in his mouth, that refresheth it much. You haue also in the third part, the twefth chapter and tenth §. and afterwards in the seuen∣teenth chapter and 7. §. very many things which are all good against the thirst, where you may haue choise of that which is best for this malady. These cooling and comfortable medicines following are to be dayly vsed for refreshing and comforting, namely, conserues of Roses, conserues of waterlillies, and the sirupes of them both, conserues of Cicorie. In like maner also the rootes of the same in a sallad or confected, are very meete for it. The confected Citrons, and the iuice thereof; the iuice and sirupe of Orenges, conserues of white Roses, and all that is made thereof, is for this purpose highly commended, for they coole more than red Roses. Secondly, the kidneyes and backbone are also through this malady very much tormented, with a great heate; whereto is very commodious the salue of Roses, wherewith he must be an∣nointed six or seuen times in 24. houres. Also it is very good to moisten the backbone often with milke, and also to annoint it with oyle of Roses or with oyle of Violets. Thirdly, there happeneth otherwhiles to this patient (that is féeble already) a sore sweate, which may cast the patient altogether downe, which may by the foresayd meanes be hindered. But if that will not helpe, then besprinkle the face and the whole body often with this water following: Take twelue ounces of Rose water, one quarter of an ounce of Camfere, Puslaine séedes and red Saunders, of each a dragme, one quarter of an ounce of starch, mingle them all together. This drinke following is also highly commended: Take sixe or seuen riuer Crabs, lay them in a quart of water, then cast therein a hanfull of ashes, and let them stand foure houres long; afterwards rub then wel therwith, and wash them cleane with faire water thrée or foure times, and so seeth them; and take the tayles of them, cut them very small, and séeth them againe with a quart of barley water till they be almost consumed, then straine the broth through a cloth, and giue thereof thrée or foure ounces euery time to the patient to drinke when you will. But if you will haue this water to coole more and nourish lesse, then séeth the Crabs whole and vncut, and not so long time as is aforesaid. After this maner may you also dresse a Tortoyse that liueth in fresh water, and is excellent good for this disease. The small fishes that are taken in fresh waters, are very commodious for this disease, if they be taken without spice.
In the description of the consumption Phthisis, in the second part, the fifth chapter, and 22. §. are many kinds of remedies prescribed for this Hectica, and afterwards also in the sixth chapter of the panting of the heart through heate are diuers cullises described that are very good and profitable to be drunken. You may also prepare these confections following for the same: take of the white flesh of a yong Hen or capon sixe ounces, starch one ounce and a halfe, new oyle of swéete Almonds sixe ounces, fiue whites of new layd egges; let the oyle, starch, and egges séeth together on a soft fire vntill it be thicke, afterwards mingle the flesh of a Capon being chopt small amongst them, and make cakes thereof, whereof the patient may vse a little at each time, and as often as him pleaseth, which also is as good as if he tooke much at once, seldome, and better. Or prepare this following: take white Poppie séedes, péeled séedes of Melons, Citruls, Cucumbers, and of Pom∣peons, of each a quarter of an ounce, Almonds, Hasell nuts, Pistacies (all of them shaled) and Sebestes, of each thrée dragmes, Pingles that haue bin stéeped 24. houres before in Rose water fiue dragmes, conserues of Burrage, Buglosse, and Species Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each one quar∣ter of an ounce, conserue of Roses fiue dragmes, Manus Christi with pearles and sugar pennets, of each halfe an ounce, rosted Capons flesh two ounces, white flesh of Hens that is stuft and drest with Buglosse, Baulme, Burrage and Endiue, thrée ounces, cut both of these small, and then mingle therewith Species Diambra and de Gemmis, of each halfe a dragme, Doronicum, Saf∣fron, Cinnamom, Roses, and red Coral, of each fiue dragmes, Species Diatriasantalon, and grains, prepared pearles a quarter of an ounce, sugar sodden as thicke as hony, as much as néede requi∣reth for to make a confection, mingle them well, and vse it as aforesaid, one quarter of an ounce at once. There is also vsually made for this a confection of oyle of swéete Almonds, starch and sugar. The preserued Gourds are also wonderfull good against this vnnaturall heate. Of the Ague Hectica, with a paine in the breast Empyema and Phthisis. §. 1. IN this compounded Ague, which is placed amongst the Putridas or putrified Agues, there doth appéere besides the former signes, cold, and a very stifnesse of cold, which commeth at vncertaine times, sometimes by day and otherwhiles by night, and that alwayes vnstedfast, which hapneth by the diuersitie of the hu∣mors, whereof now the one and then the other is stirred vp and inflamed. The corruption which is gathered together in the breast, out of the head, or out of the veines, doth chiefly cause this consumption, which lieth there putrified and mingled with the blood; i cast out and expelled: and albeit that this kind of consumption and also the former be incurable, yet you must be maruellous diligent by these meanes following to accomplish health is far as it is possible. First therefore you must refraine and shun all things that are sharpe and salt, as Mustard, Radishes, Onions, Garlicke, and such like. Item, all flatulent and windy things, and all that is cold by nature and hard of digestion, as vnsodden milke, porredge of pease or beanes, vnleauened and dough baked bread, Veriuice and Limons, &c. His drinke must be good common cléere Béere, or any thin red swéete Wine, but he must re∣fraine from strong wine and béere: but if he cannot beare wine nor béere, then giue him to drink good sugred Barley water. Yong lambes flesh, yong swine, Muttons of a yéere old, and calues, are very wholsome meate for him. Also Larkes, wood fowles, Partridges, Fesants, and Hares; and specially riuer Crabs sod in barly water or milke, are passing good. Coleworts sodden, stewed Barley drest with starch, Calues féet sodden in vineger, the lights of all beasts, but chiefly of Foxes and Hogs, rere sodden egs, or the same drest with other meate, fresh butter and chéese but little salted, milke pap, thrée or foure drie figs eaten before meales, and sweete Pomegranates rosted in the warme ashes, are all of them much nourishing. After meate let him also eate thrée or foure rosted Hasell nuts, and Saffron and Cinnamome in his meate measurably.
These confections following are also most commodious for him: Take white Poppie séedes an ounce, rosted flesh of a Capon foure ounces, starch thrée quarters of an ounce, prepared Pin∣gles foure ounces, péeled Almonds three ounces, Roses thrée dragmes, yellow Saunders and Mace, of each a quarter of an ounce, Cinnamome thrée quarters of an ounce, Cloues halfe an ounces, Lignum Aloes two dragmes and a halfe, Nutmegs a dragme, Amber two scruples, Musk sixe graines, fresh oyle of swéet Almonds foure ounces, sugar which is sodden with Rose water and Baulme water, as much as néede requireth for a confection; mingle all these well together beaten and shread small: take thereof euery morning and euening halfe an ounce euery time be∣fore meate. And when as this disease falleth out of the head into the breast, and that this Ague Hectica hath from thence her beginning, then must special care be had for to comfort the braines, which may thus be compassed. First, let the head be shorne bald, and then vpon the naked shorne head lay this plaister following: Take Laudanum a dragme and a halfe, Rosin and red Storax, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Masticke, Roses and white Corall, of each halfe a dragme, Sandaraca a dragme and a halfe, Mace two scruples, Cloues one scruple; dissolue the gum and rosin in vi∣neger that is not too eager, then mingle it all together with molten waxe, and make thereof two round plaisters, which you may lay thereon, now one and then another. Secondly, take a little péece of Masticke, chew the same once a day at the least a long time, and then spet out the moisture, and about the third euening let him alwayes after meate swal∣low a peece of Masticke. Thirdly, the fift night when he goeth to bed let him take a dragme and a half of this confection following: Take of the confection Diapapauer halfe an ounce, Frankinsence & Sandaraca, of each eight graines, and mingle them all together. Fourthly, take of the confection of Loch de Pino, and de Papauere, of each an ounce, prepared Foxe lights one quarter of an ounce, Ireas two scruples, flowers of Centorie halfe a scruple, make a confection thereof with Vine cuict, wherof the patient is to take euery morning two or three dragmes, and likewise at night as much more, to wit, two houres after meate. Also you may drinke it mingled with warme barly water, or with swéete wine, and so drinke it. Also the patient may take of this confection into his mouth, and so swallow it vp oftentimes. Fiftly, take two ounces of Currans, a dragme of sliced Licorice, Hyssope and Horehound, of each two scruples, yellow séedes of Roses two dragmes, prepared Foxe lights one dragme and a halfe, Dragagant and Gum, of each a dragme, melt the gum in Vine cuict, halfe a scruple of Saffron, white pepper fiue graines, and white sugar thrice as much as all the rest do weigh, make it to powder, whereof let him eate a spoonefull after dinner and supper. Sixtly, when as the patient hath vsed ten dayes long the foresaid thrée things, then let him take these things following other ten dayes: Take distilled Colewort water two ounces, water of blew Flower deluce flowers, and of Horehound, of each half an ounce, poudered Elecampane rootes and Mouse eare that groweth on the mountaines, of each a scruple, which the patient must take luke warme early in the morning, and fast foure houres after it. Seuenthly, take Knotgrasse, Mouse eare, Roses, red Corall, Bloodstone, and yellow Amber, of each one scruple, Dragagant halfe a scruple, Hony of Violets, and Sugar pennets, of each thrée quarters of an ounce: afterwards séeth the Hony and Sugar till it be thicke, and then min∣gle them with it, and take thereof an houre before supper a spoonefull, and againe as much more at midnight. Eightly (this being done) you must vse this confection following: Take fresh rootes of blew Flowerdeluce one ounce, fresh Elecampane rootes halfe an ounce, Comfrey, Daisies, iuice of Sloes, Dragagant and Gum, of each a scruple, Frankinsence, Masticke, and Sarcocolla (prepa∣red with womans milke) of each halfe a dragme, Bloodstone, yellow Amber, Dragon blood, pre∣pared Foxe lights, Centorie flowers, Mirtle séede, Knotgrasse, Mouse eare and Brionie, of each two scruples, dissolue all the Gums in the muscilage or slime of Sebestes that were stéeped in warme Hony water, let them séeth therein, scumming it alwayes: and when it is sod to pappe, to wit, the herbes and the rootes, then straine out the iuice through a cloth, and put thereto two ounces of swéete wine, Currans halfe an ounce, and ten or twelue Dates; powne all the same very small, and mingle then the Gums with the rest of the foresaid things: Also halfe a dragme of Saffron, powdered Saxifrage a dragme and halfe, whereof giue the patient a spoonefull in
the morning, and halfe an houre before both his mealetides halfe as much, and let him swallow it downe by little and little. This cleanseth the breast, ingendreth flesh, and withall damnifieth not the breath. Ninthly, when the patient hath vsed this confection foure dayes long, then let him take nine of these pilles following, to wit, in the morning betimes three, and thrée more before noone, and also before supper other thrée more. This must he continue foure dayes together or longer, euen as the cause requireth. Take Lungwort, Knotgrasse, Comfrey, Daisies, of each a dragme, Saf∣fron, Licorice, Saxifrage, of each one scruple, Starch, sealed earth, prepared Tutie, and Dra∣gagant, of each two scruples, make pilles thereof with the iuice of Comfrey, and forme eight to a dragme. Tenthly, if occasion serue that the heart must also be strengthened, and to quench and refresh all drouth, and to coole and moisten all heate, for which you shall take new conserues of Roses two ounces, conserues of Buglosse one ounce, burnt Iuorie, Roses, séeds of Endiue, of Purslain and Lettice, of each a dragme and a halfe, peeled Melon séede, Pompeon séede, Gourds séeds, and peeled Cucumber séeds, of each fiue dragmes, sugar pennets two ounces, starch one ounce, prepa∣red crabs tailes (as in this chapter not long ago is taught) foure ounces, powne all very small, and mingled into a confection, then when he hath vsed the pils, let him take a spoonefull thereof, and that in the morning early, and likewise againe an houre and a halfe before both mealtides, and after them halfe as much. Last of al, this patient must lay this smal bag vpon his left breast: Take Violets, waterlillies, burnt Iuorie, Roses, red and white Corall, Harts bones, and Doronicum, of each a dragme and a halfe, the Iacinth stone, the Smaragde stone, and Saphire stone, of each halfe a scruple pearls a dragme and a halfe, thrée leaues of beaten gold, and Mace one dragme and a halfe, saffron a a scruple, Cardamome and Galingall, of each fiue graines, powne each alone, and then mingle them all together, and lastly make it into a silken cushion or little bag. But if you couet to haue the braines strengthened, then looke in the beginning of the first part for the paine of the head, and after that where the braines are described. The twelfth Chapter. Of the Ague Marasmode. OF this Ague and of the nature thereof we haue in the former described Hectica made a plaine demonstration. This is of some taken for to be a se∣cond Hectica. In fine, they are both such kind of Agues, that there is smal help of man to be had against them. This properly is that which the Phisitions cal Senectam, that is, the old age, to wit, a consuming of the whole body. The causes of this is, that the heate and the drouth get the mastery, which might be caused when one is fasting and hath a cold stomacke: In like maner also when one is ouerheated, and straightway drinketh cold water vpon it: Also the hot aire and the heate of the time may well prouoke and raise that which wasteth, drieth vp, and oftentimes expelleth the naturall heate, whereby the body is sustained, whereof the cold and drouth do follow. Moreouer, this sicknesse may be caused of the debilitie of naturall heate which cannot nou∣rish the whole body: and in like maner of cold vapors that ascend towards the heart and ouer-coole the same. Likewise of all cold causes that lie hidden in the body, as may be séene by very old folkes. These are signes of this malady that it is without any Ague, but with a slow pulse, with an extenuation of the whole body, without heate, and in feeling may a generall cold be perceiued: the vrine is thin, white and waterish. In fine, there are no other signes to be found than age, as are to be séene in very old folkes. Now to come to the remedies of this kind of consumption, this patient shall vse as néere as he may, all warme and moist things. He must often bathe himselfe in fresh warme water, and vse many moystening clisters, as the broth of Lambes heads, of tripes, of Hens, and the like:
for these are very commodious for him because they moisten the bowels, and refresh and nourish the liuer. But you must put hereto neither salt nor any spice, that they be not too sharp, and may be held in the longer. You must also take for this Clister not aboue sixe ounces of broth at once, but in foure and twentie houres you are to minister thrée or foure. Also the rubbing or bathing of the externall parts after meales is greatly commended: and as Hony in the Ague Hectica is very hurtfull; so is it in this disease Marasmode very com∣modious. Further, all light meates are passing good for him that are not slimie, as fresh broth, reare egges, with a thinne and pleasant wine being measurably vsed, and such like. Item, all the salues, plaisters, and other things which are prescribed for the Feuer Hectica, may also be vsed in this sicknesse. But for these diseases speciall héed is to be taken of cold, and of all things as in any way con∣sume the radicall humiditie. Those that wil haue any further declaration of this infirmity, let them reade that which hath bene said in the description of the consumption or feuer Hectica. The thirteenth Chapter. Of the long lingring Agues. THe long continuing of Agues dependeth vpon thrée kinds of causes. First, when any one hath an outward sore which hardly will be cured. Secondly, if the patient or the Phisition euer mistake, or kéepeth some bad order. Thirdly, this is also procured by some outward occasion, as by the time of the yeare, by continuall raine, by the nature of the countrey, by the vnhailnesse of the dwelling place, by great care and troubles of mind. But when it is knowne that there are none of these foresaid occasions, then must it of ne∣cessitie depend on the fourth cause, that is on a grosse, tough and slimie humor. If therefore you will haue remedy against the continuing of Agues, then must you cure and take away the fore∣said causes with their contraries. For that these long continuing Agues are commonly caused by an obstruction of the liuer, whereto these things following are principally good, to wit, sirupus Diarrhodon, de Cichorio, de Lupulis, de Eupatorio, de capillo Veneris, Oxymel compositum, de Bysantijs, de Radicibus. Item, the decoction of Adiantum, Harts toong, Agrimony, Wormewood, Endiue, Cicorie, of all, or of some of them. The common pestilentiall pilles, called Ruffi, and Rubarbe, Cassie, Hiera picra, conserue of Prunes, Agaricus, and sirupe of Roses laxatiue, are also excellent good. Item, you must boile also Parsly roots with your meate: the wine shal be mingled with water wherein Cinnamome, Annis séed, Coriander, and Fennell rootes are sodden. You must annoint the liuer with the salue that is described in the third part, the twelft chap∣ter and third §. beginning thus, Take oyle of bitter Almonds, &c. in which place you shall find many moe other remedies against the obstruction of the liuer through heate and cold. For the liuer being deopilated and opened, then will the long lingring Ague be easily mitigated. The fourteenth Chapter. Of swellings that follow after the Ague. IT commeth oftentimes to passe that some haue their féete swolne after the long continuing of an Ague, then vse a bath to sweate in, and take one ounce of the distilled water of Cammomill flowers which hath bene drawne onely out of the yellow séedes of the flowers. You must boyle in the water of this bath Sloe leaues, and therewithall bathe and sweate. In the bathing you shall forbeare from drinke: but this bath is more commodious after some phlegmaticke
Agues than after any hote Agues; and what order of diet is to be obserued after a lingering Ague when the patient beginneth to recouer, hath beene sufficiently shewed and declared in the third Chapter and the twelfth §. The fifteenth Chapter. Of the Plague. THis most noisome, terrible, and perillous malady of the plague, is called of the Gréekes Epidemia, and of the Latinists Lues, Pestis, and Pestilentia, which last name we also vse. This malady is described by Galen after this manner. The Plague is a sicknes that doth infect all, or at the least very many men, and is caused of the venemous ayre. Or thus: The Plague is a disease that either spéedily killeth, or soone forsaketh a man. And where such sicknesses get the vpper hand, there distresse and mi∣sery aboundeth, for it hath bene seene by experience that it hath made away men, cattel, and fowles of the aire, yea many thousands of fishes in the waters, and that not onely villages and townes haue bene depriued thereby of all their inhabitants, but also great cities and countries haue by the same bene made desolate. The causes of the Plague. §. 1. OF the naturall causes of the Plague, there are as many opinions amongst the Philosophers as there are causes that procure it; as namely of venemous va∣pors of the earth that are infected by some earthquakes: or if a countrey be hot, moyst, full of stenches, full of lakes, or still standing waters, and cloyed with stench of dead bodies, as it oftentimes befalleth after great wars and slaughters; but especially is the aire infected as is abouesaid through sinne, whereby it may diuersly be venomed. Also when the aire is warme and moist, and that it doth raine much in time of heate, with a Southerly wind, whereof we will not at this present make any further discourse: but they that desire to haue any ampler description hereof, may reade ouer the Philosophers, and other learned Phisitions. But howsoeuer, this is the most certaine cause of this sicknesse, that God the Lord for our manifold sinnes and wickednesse, to wit, idolatrie, incredulitie, and ingratitude, hath vsed this Plague and many afflictions moe, as hunger, warre, and shedding of blood, to punish the fore∣said sinnes and transgressions. These are his rods and scourges (euen the ministers of his wrath) to chastice the wicked world, as (through his Prophets) he hath foresaid and threat∣ned the world, and as both holy Scriptures and heathen writers testifie, that it hath after∣ward ensued accordingly. Signes of the Plague to come. §. 2. FIrst, it is a certaine signe that the aire is infected, and that a plague is to be expec∣ted, if in the end of the sommer there appeare Comets, or any other impressions, which men cal flakes of fire, starres that fall or shoote, and such like in the element, which proceede of vapors that are drawne out of the earth into the aire, and there are kindled, whereby both men and cattell are infected. Secondly, when any vnaccustomed heape of beasts are séene, as of Frogs, Toades, Grashop∣pers, Mice, and Wormes, which oftentimes haue bene approoued heretofore. Thirdly, when in the winter the South or East windes abound, mistie or foggie weather, full of vapors, and glowing or drowsie, and like as it would raine, and yet raineth not at all: these are signes that the aire is not as it should be. Also if the spring of the yeare be cold and drie without raine, the wind Southerly, the aire foggie and lowring, and standeth so at a stay eight
dayes long, and then altereth into warmth: if these alterations often chance, then is it a certaine and infallible signe that the plague is at hand. In like maner also is it a sure token of the plague to ensue, when in the sommer time it is hot a dayes and cold a nights. Item, when the sommer is not hot, but gloomy & cloudy, and one day hot and another day cold, then must we looke for a plague in haruest. In like maner also if two or three dayes be very hot, and afterwards very cold, as it often chanceth, then doth it prognosticate a plague. How to preuent the Plague. §. 3. THere is no more Christian nor certaine meanes for to escape this great punish∣ment, then for a man to reconcile himselfe to his heauenly Father, and to pray vnto him with much contrition and heartie repentance of his sins, that it would please him to withhold his threatnings and punishments for our due deserts, and that we acknowledge him from the bottome of our hearts to be the right onely and true Phisition that will and can preserue vs, be it liuing or dying, in perpetuall health and welfare. Yet notwithstanding hath he not in vaine created naturall meanes, nor forbidden vs to vse them, but rather all things, as Phisitions, phisicke, rootes, herbes, séedes, and the aires, yea all that is aboue and vnder the earth for the benefite of man, and to serue him, therefore we ought duly to accept and receiue the same as a most godly benefite and noble blessing of so good a God, and in no manner of wise to despise the same, and therefore are all learned Phisitions most highly to be estéemed, that haue found out so many meanes for all kinds of diseases, as also for this present infection, and haue reuealed and made them knowne to mankind. And to the end men may haue a good instruction how this sicknesse may be holpen with the foresaid remedies, there shall be obserued these thrée principall points: the first whereof is for the healthy, that thereby they may know what order is to be kept, whereby they might be fréed from this vene∣mous contagion. Secondly, we are to shew that if any be taken with the Ague, or other signes, with sores or biles, or not at all, what ought to be done to them, or what is to be left off. Thirdly, we will speake of all such as kéepe those that are so diseased, and are to minister and serue them, for the which there be many approoued and famous medicines selected, both by the ancient and latter Phisitions, our most louing and mercifull God giue vs his gracious blessing and prosperitie to finish them. First then it is generally concluded by all learned men, that forasmuch as the heart requi∣reth a sweete, cleane, and healthy ayre, like as the body requireth meate and drinke: also that nothing is more venemous, noysome, nor hurtfull for the same, than a foule stinking ayre; for thence commeth it especially if a loose and vnstayed life, either in excesse of meate, drinke, exer∣cise, incontinencie, wrath, and such like be adioyned, that the venemous ayre with other infec∣tions, the sooner hurt the heart and inner parts, and by their contagion disease the whole body, and lastly bereaue man of his vitall breath. How the healthy may be kept and preserued from the infection of the Plague. §. 4. EVen as we haue oftentimes heretofore admonished, so will we now shew by what meanes the haile and healthy may in the time of the Plague be fréed and preserued from this contagious malady; therefore is it first of all néedfull to obserue a good diet in eating and drinking: and further a faire cleane dwelling which must be smoked and perfumed, thereby to correct and take away the cor∣ruption of the ayre. For this must be vsed all fragrant things, to kéepe the body loose with laratiue medicines, and to comfort the heart with cordials, and alwayes to take somewhat whereby all the parts of the body and the vitall spirits might be comforted and de∣fended against the venimous aire, and contagion of others that we might be conuersant withal, with many moe things as shall hereafter appeare. And first of the order to be obserued in diet. It is passing good, and very néedfull for euery
bodie that wisheth to liue out of the danger of the Plague, to take great héede that his bodie be not pestered with ouer many humors, nor ouercharged with meate and drinke, but to liue very soberly, and that all such meate as he taketh must be more drying than moistening, for that whereas there is an vnmeasurable fulnesse of the stomacke, there are many bad humors ingen∣dred, which afterwards by this contagion very easily are infected. Neither ought any bodie to eate before that he féele and find that his former meates and digested; and when nature by hun∣ger or thirst requireth food, then satisfie her without longer delay: for as the ouer charging of the stomack is a great cause of corruption, euen so also doth an empty stomack procure bad humors. It is likewise very commodious, that all the patients meate be rather cold than hot in operatiō, which must be dressed with sower & eager things, as we shal herafter instruct you more at large. His dread must be of good wheate, well raised, baked, and seasoned. Of fowles, the Partridges, land fowles, Pullets, Hens, Capons, and yong Pigeons. Item, yong Weathers and Veale, yet rather rosted than sodden, or else if it be sodden, then must it be drest with sower things. And for that the Plague oftentimes infecteth all fourefooted beasts, as Oxen, shéepe, swine, and sometimes the very birds of the aire, therefore great héede must be taken that then neither the flesh nor the milke of them in any way be vsed: also the Magistrates ought not to permit any of the flesh of those beasts so infected, to be sold. Note also that in the time of the Plague all sower things are very wholesome, and therefore Vineger is highly commended with all kind of meates, and especially vineger of Roses, or of Gilloflowers, or of Framboyes. Item, horse radish with Vineger and Sorrell beaten for sauce, Pomegranates, Saint Iohns grapes, or Ribes vulgaris, Veriuice, preserued Cherries, con∣serues of Barberies, and all sirupes that are made of these foresaid things, vnripe Grapes drest with their meate, new Limons and Citrons, these are all very good to be vsed in time of the Plague. Item, for all such as haue no paine in their eyes nor ach in the head are rosted Onions (or the same softened in faire water) passing good: but Garlicke aboue all the rest (being drest in meates) is wonderfull good, and much estéemed for a preseruatiue against this kind of infection. Therefore it is commaunded that men dip their bread in Vineger, wherewith the iuice of wild Thyme and of Garlicke is tempered: also to eate the kernels of two or thrée Nuts dipped in the same. And you may vse this sauce following with your meate: Take Vineger and iuice of Li∣mons, temper it as you thinke good with powned Walnuts, and with a little grated bread, and and you may also (if you please) put thereto some Saffron and Cinnamome. And you may make a temperature also with Currans and Vineger, flesh broth, Cinnamom: poched egges are also permitted if they be vsed with veriuice. Of fruites, all that be sower are onely tolerated. And you may strew this powder following vpon the meate: Take prepared pearles one quarter of an ounce, red Corall and fine Bolus, of each half a dragme, Cinnamom two dragmes and a half, and then mingle them all together. The meates that are forbidden to be vsed for the healthie, are these, to wit, Milke and all that is drest therewith: all swéete fruits, stewed apples and peares are allowed: muddie or slimy fish are especially prohibited, as Eeles, Tenches, and such like; but such fish as are taken from sandie ground are not bad: old powdered flesh, or salt fish are also suspected. But be it flesh or fish, let the same be alwayes drest with some sower thing, as with Vineger, the iuice of Limons, Veriuice, and such like. Or you may vse these sawces following: Take the iuice of Pimpernel, of Sorrell, Buglosse, of Scabious, of Rue, of Lettice, of Endiue, of Baulme, of Elecampane, al together, or some of them, as it pleaseth you, and mingle them with vineger and bread, as you thinke good. Item, Capers with the iuice of Limons or of Citrons, is also a healthie sauce to be vsed. All water fowles, as Duckes, Géese, Hernsewes, and such like, let him not eate; notwithstanding that the Duckes blood is thought to be a preseruatiue against venom. And for your drinke, you must not vse any but onely to flacke thirst withall, or according as the partie hath eaten: the best drinke is white cléere and thin Wine (which is not swéete) being tempered with stéeled water, or that wherein Gold hath bene extinguished. But there can be no better thing than to drinke faire fountaine water which is tempered with vineger and su∣gar, or water wherein the iuice of Pomegranates is mixed. You may also make a drinke of Barberries, and Iuniper berries, whereof you néede to take but now and then a little draught.
And you must also note here, that it were not amisse to drinke euery mealetide a draught of Wormewood or Sage wine, or in stead of them to take a bit of bread that is stéeped in the wine of Elecampane and wine of Zeduary. These are the ordinances that in the time of the plague are to be kept and obserued in meate and drinke, hauing alwayes a good regard (as we haue already sayd) of the time of the yeare, of the constitution of the patient, of his accustomed manner of diet, and so forth, whereby either of the foresaid things may be vsed or omitted. How their dwellings ought to be. §. 5. IT is also very néedful for a preseruation against this sicknes, that the house and all the chambers (as wel as the body) be kept neate and cleane. Therefore euery housholder ought (if he loue the health of himselfe & his family) to looke diligently that his house or place of his dwelling be kept very cleane. All tame beasts, and especially swine ought to be kept far apart from all your dwelling houses. Your house is to haue many windowes in it, and that such windowes as do stand to∣wards the West and South must you keepe close and shut; but the windowes that be towards the East and North must be opened wide, so that the plague be not in those quarters néere hand. Warme stoues are very vnhaile, and especially if they do lie low: but in the chimney it is best to burne drie wood, and most of all Iumper wood, drie Vine branches, Firwood, Ash, Okes Ci∣pres wood, Bay trees, and Rosemary stickes, and that according to the nature of the place where euery kind of wood is best to be had, and chiefly the Béech trée, for that there is no kind of wood that more taketh away the venemous vapor or infection of the plague than the Béech trée doth. Moreouer, you must cause the house to be swept wherein you dwell at least twice a day, and besprinkled with vineger or Rose water, and then to smoke it with some of these things follow∣ing, to wit, with Iuniperberries, Hyssap, Marierom, wild Thime, Mints, Rosemary, Marirom gentle, and Basil, with Lauander, Penniroyal, and apple parings, or such like. And for rich men you may make diuers compounded things, whereof we wil write at large, which you may vse as néede shall require. First there are perfumes which the Apothecaries do cal Ozyletes: for this must you vse Iuniper, yellow Saunders, Paradise wood, Frankinsence, and Iuniper berries, of each thrée dragmes, Amber, Iuniper, Gum, Sandaraca, and Rosemary flowers, of each one dragme, Nutmegs and Cloues, of each one dragme and a halfe▪ powne them all together to powder, and then put to it of Laudanum one ounce and a halfe, Benzoi and red Storax, of each a quarter of an ounce, blacke Frankinsence thrée dragmes, Tilly coles that are to be sprinkled and moistened with Aqua vitae being beaten small, halfe as much as all the rest: afterwards make the morter and the pestell very warme, and then put therein the Laudanum with a little Turpentine, temper them toge∣ther till they be as soft as dough, and mixe then therwith all the foresaid things, and make here∣of a strong dough with molified Dragagant, and roule it on a table that is rubbed ouer with oyle of Spike, and make the candles as great and as small as you list to haue them, making them vnderneath with thrée féete that they may stand, and let them drie in the sun: and when you set those candles in a close chamber to fume, they wil for certaine expell all the venemous aire of the Plague. These things following are vsed for this at Augburch in high Dutchland, to wit, Laudanum two ounces, black and white Frankinsence, of each one ounce, red Storax half an ounce, Benzoi three quarters of an ounce, Cloues, Roses, Cinnamom, blacke Coriander, Masticke, Sandaraca, Cipres wood, Bayberries, yellow Saunders and Nutmegs, of each one dragme beaten small, liquid Storax two ounces, Waxe one ounce, Turpentine two ounces and a halfe, burnt wine or Aqua vitae as much as is needfull; the Laudanum, Storax, Waxe and Turpentine is to be mol∣ten i a warme mortar, and hereof may you make candles as is before taught: if the dough be hard, then make it soft with burnt wine. Another: Take Paradise wood, Saffron, Cinnamome, Cloues, yellow Saunders, and Roses, of each halfe a dragme, Masticke, red Storax, and Fran∣kinsence, of each a quarter of an ounce; powne them very small, and then make it vp with liquid Storax into dough, but temper not too many Tilly coles amongst it, that the vertue of the o∣ther things be not thereby abated, and forme them as before.
Or take Benzoin, Gallia Moscata, red Storax, & roots of Costus, of each halfe an ounce, Dipta∣mus, Tormentill, Citron peels, & Setwall, of each a drag. red & white Behen, of each half a drag. red, yellow, and white Saunders, Roses, of each half a drag. powne all that are to be powned, melt the Laudanum with Rose water in a warme mortar, & then forme candles thereof, as is a∣foresaid: these candles are specially good against the pestilent ayre. But for that the right Co∣stus rootes and Behen are ill to be gotten, are these candles but seldome made. These following are also vsed: take Laudanum, red Storax, Myrrhe and Masticke, of each a quarter of an ounce, Rosemarie leaues, wild Galingall, and Roses, of each half an ounce, Cin∣namom, Cloues, yellow Saunders, and Nutmegs, of each a drag. Tilly cooles moystened with burnt wine or Aqua vitae, foure ounces, then forme them as before. Yet other: Take Cipers wood and Iuniper, of each halfe a drag. small beaten Iuniper ber∣ries (the kernels taken out) Rosemarie leaues, and wild Galingall, of each thrée drag. blacks and white Frankinsence, of each halfe an ounce, Laudanum thrée quarters of an ounce, Tilly coles as aforesaid. In the stead of these fuming candles, men vse to make also cakes of all the foresaid doughes (but onely the coles left out) and in winter time you may vse them laid on the coles, or on the hote furnace of your stoue. Item, take yellow Saunders, Benzoin, and red Storax, of each a quarter of an ounce, white Frankinsence one drag. Nutmegs & Cloues, of each half a drag. Roses, Coriander, & Sugar, of each a scrup. beate all small to powder, and then mingle them together with Dragagant dissol∣ued in Rose water (as afore is taught) in a mortar, and in Summer then prepare them with fresh Roses, to wit, that each cake be couered with a Rose leafe, and then pressed flat: but if you would haue them costlier, then put vnto it foure greines of Muske, and two greins of Amber, dissolued in Rose water, and then will they be excéeding pleasant. These are also vsually made at Ausburgh: Take Benzoin thrée quarters of an ounce, the roots of Cipers halfe a drag. red Storax, and white Saunders, of each 3. drag. Cloues and prepared Coriander, of each a drag. Calmus and Frankinsence, of each halfe a drag. Musk two greines, white Sugar sixe ounces: then make cakes thereof with dissolued Dragagant. Item, take ben Cipers and Iuniper wood, of each thrée drag. Rosemarie flowers and Iuni∣per berries, of each a quarter of an ounce, white and black Frankinsence, of each half an ounce; beate them very small, and temper them with as much Laudanum, that it cleaue together, or with dissolued Dragagant, Turpentine or Storax. Or take Iuniperberries, Bayberries, Roses, Wormwood branches, Mastick, Frankinsence, Cardamome, Rue, and Cloues, of each a like quantitie; then mixe them together with dissol∣ued Dragagant as aforesaid, and then lay it on the furnace in your stoue. Here followeth now a very costly water to temper with these kinds of cakes, Candles, and Pomanders. Take good Rosewater one pint, Lauander flowers thrée M. Cloues and Cinnamom, of each halfe an ounce, yellow and white Sanders, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Mace a quarter of an ounce, Roses one M. Benzoin and red Storax, of each 2. drag. powne them small, & powre thy Rosewater thereon, or Muscadell wine, or any other strong wine, eight ounces, Aqua vitae one ounce: let it be close stopt one moneth or twain, and so stand in the Sun: Afterwards distill it in séething water, stopt very excéeding tight and close, with a helme. And with that which is stilled temper Muske and Amber, and then set it in the Sun againe. This Rosewater following is also very excellent for the same, or any such like intent: When you will distil the Roses in common Stils, then must you not set them in sand but in ashes, and then put some Roses into it, and cast on it the powder of Cloues, then lay on it more Roses, and so do till the Still be full; then put on the helme, and make it tight and close, taking héede of burning. But if you will haue it stronger, then put to them more spices, as Benzoin, and such like. Lastly, then may you strengthen the sauour of the water distilled with Musk and Amber: both of these waters may also be vsed for other things as is aforesaid. But if you will spare this labour, then may you vse the foresaid things each apart, or mixed together (as you please) with hote coles, and so let it sauour and fume. In like manner may you prepare these powders following: Take Benzoin, red Storax, Pa∣radise wood, Muske, Amber, Cloues, Frankinsence, Myrrhe, Masticke, and Gallia Muscata,
which or as many of them as you will; powne them to powder: for this powder you must omit the coles, the Laudanum, and the other dissolued things, the which otherwise are commonly v∣sed in the compositions before. Item, take grated or powdred Cipers wood a M. also of prepared Cipers halfe as much, bea∣ten Rosemarie halfe as much as of the Cipers, blacke and white Frankinsence, of each halfe an ounce, Bayberries shaled cleane a quarter of an ounce, being grosly beaten, mingle them well together, and strew a little of it on the coales; for it is a most pleasant sauour. And if you feare that such odoriferous sauors were too hote in Summer, then may you put thereto some of the leaues and séeds of Myrtle, also to augment the quantitie of Camfer, San∣ders and Citron peels: sprinkle it also with Vineger or Rosewater. In stead of fire strew the chamber with Rose leaues, and let them be swept out at night, that they be no cause of stench; and before you go to bed you must fume the chamber well. It is also very méete that you kéep lying in the chamber where you sléep, odoriferous Quin∣ces, Citrons, Apples, Peares, Oranges, and such like. When they begin to rot, then must they be had away, and other laid in their places. Also in Summer you may prepare this powder following: Take Roses, Myrtle séeds, Citrō péels, red, yellow, and white Saunders, Sorrell séeds, & wild Vine leaues, of each one drag. & a halfe, Myrrhe, Paradise wood, Dragagant, and Gum, of each two dragmes, Camfer a drag. all stamped small, and put them together. You may also make it vp into cakes with dissolued Dragagant. If it be in Winter, then take Myrrhe, Paradise wood, Mastick, red Storax, and Frankinsence, of each a drag. Cloues, Citron péels, and the roots of Cipers, of each halfe a drag. Camfer a scrup. Gallia Muscata, ten greins, Musk and Amber, of each 5. greins; beate them to∣gether into a powder. You may also make cakes of it with liquid Storax, & Rosewater: if you will put Laudanum to it, then make the same warme as aforesaid, & fashion your cakes as big as you will haue them. For the common people and for the husbandmen the Bay trée is very good, or if the country yéeld it, Iuniper wood with his berries, & with drie Hen dung fumed: or take powned Wormwood and Bayberries, of each a like. The rich folkes do vse to lay also with their clothes odoriferous bags, for which all the powders that are before mentioned for fumes, and hereafter for Pomanders, are very good, excepting the Laudanum, ye which is not to be pow∣dered, and other mo such soft things. This following is very common in France: Take Ireos foure ounces, Roses two ounces, wild Galingall, Cloues, and Marioram gentle, of each two dragms, yellow Saunders, and Benzoin, of each two ounces, red Storax halfe an ounce, then mingle them all together and put them in a bag. If you will you may put thereto Muske and Amber, or Camfer. In the first part, the twelfth chap. you haue also an especiall bag to streng∣then the head as thus: Take Ireos, &c. the which is very commodious for this our purpose. Al∣so you haue in the second chap. and elsewhere, applications for the strengthening of the heart; the which are not onely profitable, but also very necessarie for this intent. What exercise is to be vsed in the Plague. §. 6. IN the time of infection the healthie are to exercise themselues moderatly, and rather vse an easie walking than a great pace, that thereby the venimous ayre may not ouermuch be drawne into the bodie, as it hapneth to such as at such times do greatly labour and trauell; but when a man abideth in a cleane place, void of pestilent ayre, and will exercise his body according to his old accusto∣med manner, that cannot but be thought passing good. Of the sleepe in this sicknes. §. 7. AT such time as the Plague raigneth, some think that it is better to sléep by day than by night, euen seuen or eight howers long: first vpon the right side being méetly well couered, and his head raised high. But séeing the same is not accu∣stomed with vs, then must they eate but little in the euening, and sléep the fore∣said time of seuen or eight howers. But if he could not sléepe a nights, then must he about 12. a clocke, being 2. howres after his meale compose himselfe to sleepe.
Others counsel to sléepe a nights in a chamber that is well fumed, and close shut, but not ve∣ry long, for that through much sleepe the body is too much moistened, the which must alwaies be inclined to drouth as much as possibly may be. They also forbid sleeping by day, and that chiefly in Winter. Also you must take héede of excessiue and ouermuch watching, for that greatly dryeth and weakeneth nature. Of Purging and letting bloud. §. 8. CAre must also be had that the bodie be not too much bound: and if the going to stoole come of it selfe, it is the better; if not, then must the partie be holpen with suppositories, and mild Clisters, with Cassie, Manna, sowre Dates, and such like meanes, whereof we haue here and there spoken at large; but especially in the third part, the eleuenth chapter, §. 20. Other would haue that young cholericke bodies should generally be purged in the summer, and in the beginning of winter, with the foresaid cooling and laxatiue things, and also with yellow Mirobalans boiled with Plum-porredg: but in the end of Autumne, and in the winter with stronger medicins, to wit, with Agarick, with Turbith, and with Polypody: but they must be vsed with great héede and discretion. Touching letting of bloud: When the partie is once purged, and aboue sixtéene yeares old, being ful of bloud and strong, and without any obstruction of the liuer, then may he haue a vein opened. In like maner also women, if their termes and flowers be stopped, and if they be with∣out piles in the fundament, then may they in May and in Autumne let bloud, and if occasion serueth, once a moneth, to wit, in the Liuer veine, or Milt veine, euery time thrée or foure oun∣ces, for this taketh away the boiling of the bloud and the Cholera in the veines. Yet for this in∣fection must sometimes one, sometimes more be opened, but especially that which is fullest of bloud. But great regard must (as hath bene said) be taken of the age and weaknesse of the patient: also whether a woman haue conceiued or not, or whether she haue her termes or not, or haue the Hemmorrhoids or not, with many such circumstances more, that the weaknes of the party thereby be not augmented. Aboue and beside all this must the patient abstaine from venery as much as may be. Of the motions of the mind. §. 9. NOw concerning the motions of the mind, as sadnes, feare, sodaine motions of the mind, & such like, they do greatly alter and spoile the bloud, wherby it may the sooner receiue the pestilent ayre, and anger especially inflameth the heart, like as also doth ouermuch gladnesse: notwithstanding moderate gladnesse is most commodious for the heart. Of bathes and other common causes. §. 10. AT such times take héede of bathing, for that thereby is the body moistened, the pores opened, and all the members made the readier to receiue the infection of the plague. It is therefore very ill done (yea a temptation of God) in time of the plague to frequent common bathing houses, for that the plague can by no meanes be sooner gotten, by reason that as well the pores of the infected as the sound are opened, whereby the venimous vapor of the infected is let foorth, and may easily be receiued of the healthy: wherefore it is much better (as the custome of this countrey is) to refraine wholy from bathing. In like manner it is not good at such times to wash the head, for therby are the vitall spirits weakened, but onely to combe their heads with an Iuorie combe. But the hands must often be washt, somtimes with wine, and otherwhiles with vineger, and especially with Rose vineger.
How one shall gouerne himselfe without doores. §. 11. IT is very good that at this time euery man obserue a good diet within dores, and not accompanie himselfe with many men, for amongst many are as well those that be infected, as those that are healthie, whereby the diseased infect the healthie with their breath: but for that it is vnpossible to forbeare it, by reason that euery man hath businesse with others, it is therefore best that euery one defend himselfe from all ill ayres. Wherefore first we counsel the common sort, and men of occupation (which cannot beare grea∣ter charge) to obserue these rules following, to wit, that he in the morning betimes before he go abroad or settle himselfe to worke, take thrée or foure drie Figges, thrée or foure kernels of Nuts, and fiftéene or sixtéene leaues of Rue, with a little salt. This composition or medicine is so sure and approued, that men haue vsed the same euery where for all maner of Plagues thrée hundreth yeares before the birth of Christ: and the same was found out by K. Mithridates that waged warres with the Romaines. Some adde to it a few Almonds, and make it to a confe∣ction with clarified Honie. It is also passing good for all such as be not afraid of the bitternes, that they vse in the morning fasting a peece of the roote of Gentian, and especially when he hath vsed of the premises. Other do also giue counsell to eate but one Fig and one Nut kernell, but it is too little for a full growne person, for children it will suffise. It is also very good before the going forth in the morning to breake ones fast, and thereupon to take a little Vnicornes horne, Tormentill, Gentian, Angelica, Diptamus, Citron péeles, or a bit of Zeduarie, and hold it in your mouth: or to wash the mouth with vineger wherein Wormwood hath bene decocted. For this also confected Calmus is much commended, taken before the going into the ayre, for it hath an especiall vertue against all venimous ayre. Also some do counsell not to go out of dores before that the mouth and nostrils be cleansed with wine wherin Treacle is mixed. This composition following is commended for an especiall preseruation if inunction be made with it: Take the iuice of Garlicke and Rose vineger, of each one ounce and a halfe, Treacle thrée quarters of an ounce, Beuercod two dragmes, mixe them together, and therewith an∣noint the mouth, lips, and nose. Some do vse this salue following, therewith to annoint the heart before they go out of the house, the which is not good only for the healthie, but for all such as are alreadie infected: take Treacle three quarters of an ounce, Saffron and Camfere, of each tenne greines, the iuice of Limons and Vineger, of each a like much, or as much as is néedfull to make a salue. Or in the stead of these, he may weare the cordiall shield which is described not long since with the cordiall bag in this manner: Take Burrage, &c. It is also very good to weare gold rings wherein are set precious stones, as Rubies, Carbuncles, Saphires and Iacincts, both within the house and without dores. It is also much forbidden that any stirre out of dores before the Sun rising, as also before the going downe thereof to repaire and kéepe himselfe in his perfumed house or chamber. Further it is very good to carie some odoriferous thing in their hands, when one must deale with other folke, that through this pleasant smell the brains and the heart may be comforted and defended from all pestilent and contagious vapors. It is also not amisse for the common people that they carrie in their hands a little boxe of Iu∣niper made full of holes, wherein a little spunge moistned with vineger and Rosewater, and strewed with the powder of Cloues, be held in the hand all the Summer time, whereto also some leaues of Rue may be added daily refreshing them, and that they continually smell to the same. In this manner also maist thou hold some fruits in thy hand, as Apples, Peares, Quin∣ces, Oranges, and such like: but if it be in the winter, then take Marioram gentle, Rue, Balm, Valeriana, Iuniper berries, or some other thing stéeped in vineger, put it into thy boxe, and vse it as is aforesaid. Also thou maist bestrew thy moist spunge with Saunders, Camfere, Saffron, Paradise wood, Cloues, or Ireos. But the rich and able folke do vse Poma Ambrae, which we call Pomanders, whereof there are made many sorts, as here may appeare. Yet men must note here that all such strong odors, whereas there is any paine of the head procéeding either of heate or cold, thē are they neither so good nor so often to be vsed, but in such sort as herafter followeth, whereby the same paine as it often falleth out, be not augmented:
and women must beware of these smels, and especially those that are vexed with the suffocation of the Mother. And if it be in winter, and ye patient be cold of complexion, then are you to pre∣pare these Pomanders: Take Gallia Muscata, Roses, Cloues, Zeduarie, Mace, Nutmegs, and Paradise wood, of each a drag. Saffron a scrup. red Storax a drag. and a halfe, Ambra & Muscus, of each 5. greines, powne them all together except the two last, and then make hereof with pre∣pared Dragagant a Pomander, euen as is taught in the first part and the second Chapter. Item: take yellow Saunders a quarter of an ounce, Paradise wood a dragme and a halfe, Roses, Cloues, Zeduarie, Mace, and Nutmegs, of each halfe a dragme, Cloues, Cardamome, Coriander, and black Coriander, of each a dragme, all of them beaten to fine powder, Laudanum one ounce, Benzoin halfe an ounce, dissolue them with Rosewater and make therof an odorife∣rous Apple or Pomander: and if then you put thereto Muske and Amber, it is at your choise and pleasure. This Pomander is speciall good against a bad foggie ayre, and this following may also be vsed in winter: Take Laudanum, and red Storax, of each half an ounce, Cloues, and Cinnamom, of each a dragme and a halfe, Nutmegs, yellow Saunders, Roses, Basill, and yel∣low Amber, of each halfe a drag. powne them all together, but dissolue the Laudanum in warm Rosewater, and then make thereof a Pomander. Also the mortar (wherein these things haue bene tempered) must be wiped about with a lit∣tle kemmed shéepes wooll, and then wrap the Pomander therein, afterwards bind it vp in red sarsnet, and then they will kéepe their sent the longer. Another: Take cleane Laudanum halfe an ounce, Benzoin a quarter of an ounce, red Storax thrée dragmes, Paradise wood, yellow Saunders, white Frankinsence, and yellow Amber, of each a dragme, Rosemarie flowers, Marioram gentle, garden Mints, and Basill, of each halfe a dragme, Cloues, Nutmegs, Cardamome, Cucubes and Coriander, of each a dragme; temper them all together, and forme it into a pomander with a little liquid Storax, and at the last put a little Muske and Amber vnto it. But if it be in Summer, or that the person be of an hote complexion; then take water Lil∣lie flowers, Mints, Violets, wild Vine leaues, Roses, Myrtle seed, white and yellow Sanders, Citron péels, dried Quinces, dried Prunes, of each halfe a dragme, Saffron and Camfere, of each a scruple, Galliae Muscatae ten greins, make them vp into a pomander with Vineger wher∣in fine Bolus is dissolued: with this maist thou also vse Vineger and Rosewater. Item, take Roses, Violets, Buglosse, and Burrage flowers, of each halfe a dragme, yellow and white Saunders, of each one dragme, Ireos thrée dragmes, Balme, Citron shels, of each two dragmes, dissolued Laudanum, skant as much that it may be tempered with the rest and made vp into a pomander with Dragagant dissolued in Rosewater, and at the last adde a little Muske. There are also diuers pomanders prepared that are good at all times; amongst which first these thrée following are to be vsed in the time of the plague. Take Roses a quarter of an ounce, red and white Saunders, of each a dragme and a halfe, Camfere one scruple, Ambra halfe a drag. Muske 4. greines, Paradise wood two scrup. Citron pals halfe a drag. Cinnamom, Mace, and Nutmegs, of each a scrup. red Storax half an ounce, Laudanum one ounce, beate them very small, but dissolue the Laudanum with liquid Storax, and then make thereof a pomander. Another: Take Roses, Violets, and flowers of Buglosse, of each 2. scrup. Myrrhe, Calmus, Nutmegs, Spica of Indy, Sandaraca & Masticke, of each a scrup. Muske & Amber, of each halfe a scrup. red, white, & yellow Saunders, of each a drag.

Item, take Roses, Cloues, Mace, Spica of Indy, water Lilly flowers, Violets, Mario∣ram, Asarabacca & Sechas of each half a scrup. red & white Saunders, red and white Corall, the séed and péels of Citrons and Cucubes, of each xv. greines, Saffron, Ambra, of each one scrup.

Yet another, at all furnished Apothecaries you may find diuers preparatiues of pomanders, so that thou needest to adde nothing but Muske and Amber, of the which we will describe foure sundry sorts. Take Laudanum thrée ounces, red Storax thrée dragmes, Marioram gentle, Roses, Cam∣fer, red, white, and yellow Saunders, of each a dragme and a halfe, Cinnamom, Nutmegs, Cloues and Mace, of each a drag. Paradise wood two scrup. dissolue the Laudanum (as is afore∣said) and then make therof pomanders, vntil such time as you wil adde some other thing to it.

Preseruatiua, or preseruatiues, that defend men from the Plague. §. 12. THere are also diuers things that men (being in health) may vse in the time of the Plague, whereby they be not so soone infected of other men, for the which first of all these simples are for the most part good, to wit, Citron séedes, Scabious, Pimper∣nell the great, Rue, Valerian, Cicorie, Sorrell, and both their waters, Elecampane, Diptamus, Gentian, Tormentill, Carduus Benedictus, Angelica, & Bayberries, one of these things holden in the mouth, taken in powder, or drunken, are all especiall good against the Plague, and they may be vsed in many other compositions, as may be séene by these following. All famous Phisitions do for this sicknesse counsell, first, that men should spéedily fly farre from the contagious places, and returne backe againe with leysure: for he that is a farre off from the Plague, shall not be infected therewith, euen as no man is slaine in the warres, that is not present there. Also it is to be noted (as hath bene already said) that men ought to be loose bodied, and fréed from all superfluous humidities and vncleannesse. Therfore those that are a∣boue the age of eleuen yeares, are to be oftentimes purged with these common pils herafter de∣scribed. Also care must be taken that the heart and all other principall parts of the bodie be cō∣forted and kept dry, which may be done by the right Bole armoniack. In like manner also with Mithridate and Treacle, if that euery wéek, or at the least euery ten dayes a dragme in waight be taken with the water of Sorrell, sweating after it, & kéeping within dores all the day after. Here is also to be noted, when any one will take of this Treacle or Mithridate, that he haue eaten nothing afore, nor eate any thing afterwards in fiue or sixe howers. But amongst all other medicins & preseruatiues, these last before mentioned pils beare the pricke & price, which are to be had at the Apothecaries, called Pestilentiales Ruffi, Communes, de Tribus, and sine Cura, which the principall Phisitions haue described and commended so highly, that it hath neuer bin séene that such as vsed the same orderly were killed of the Plague, which also any one may at al times, be the person yong or old, vse without any danger: for like as it is with a pot beginning to seeth, it casteth vp scum, and is cleansed through scumming, euen so do these pils take away all superfluities and vncleannesse which is gathered together about the principall parts, and preserue the bloud from all kindes of putrifaction. These pilles are made in this sort:
Take Aloe one ounce, Myrrhe and Saffron, of each halfe an ounce, beate them all together with good pleasant wine, hereof are you to take euery weeke a dragme, or euery third day thrée pils as big as a great pease, and thereupon drinke a pretie draught of white wine that is de∣layed with Rosewater, or with Sorrell water, yet ought women with child to abstaine from them. These pils are of great force in the time of the plague, and do also driue out all superflui∣ties of the stomacke. Others take Aloe thrée quarters of an ounce, Myrrhe thrée dragmes, Saffron one dragme, Rubarb a quarter of an ounce, prepared Agaricus one dragme, Cloues, Citron séedes, and the péels, and Spica of Indy, of each a scruple, Tormentill and red Saunders, of each a dragme and a halfe, fine Bolus thrée dragmes, Camfer ten greines, powne them well all together, and make pils hereof with sirupe of Citrons. Item, take the iuice of Sorrell, the iuice of Buglosse, and of Cicorie, of each two ounces, fine Bolus one ounce, mixe them all together, and stirre them often in 24. howers, afterwards adde these things following, Aloe thrée ounces, Camfer two scruples Saphirs, Iacincts, and Sma∣ragdes, of each halfe a scruple, Pearles one drag. Citron seede a quarter of an ounce, Paradise wood, Basill séede, Amber, red Corall, and Zeduarie, of each eight greins, Roses, Violets, Sor∣rell séede, Burrage flowers, and flowers of Buglosse, of each half a scrup. stampe them all toge∣ther, & mingle it well, and afterwards set in the Sunne or in any other warme place till all the iuice be dried away. This being done, then powre more iuice thereon againe, and do so thrée times. Now when you desire to vse hereof, then make 7. pils of one drag. with some Aqua com∣posita, and take hereof euery morning or euery euening one pill, and that before meales. These following are also highly commended: Take of the common plague pilles (that are herebefore described) foure scruples, prepared Agaricus halfe a dragme, Zeduary and Angelica, of each one dragme, Rubarb one scruple, Trociscorum Alhandali fiue greines: then make pilles hereof with water of Carduus Benedictus: take of these pils one drag. once a wéeke, thrée howers after supper, and in the morning drinke a good draught of the decoction of Pease, and eate som∣what three howers after. Some vse these pils following: Take Aloe and Agaricus of each one dragme, Myrrhe and fine Bolus, of each a quarter of an ounce, Saffron a dragme; then make pils hereof with Baulme water, or water of Buglosse, and so vse them as hath bene said. These pils following do not purge, but defend the hart and all inward parts from al bad in∣fection: take Paradise wood halfe a dragme, burnt Harts horne two scruples, red Saunders one dragme, Tormentill, Citron séede, Terra sigillata, and red Coral, of each halfe a scruple, Sor∣rell seedes, Diptamus, and Zeduarie, of each a scruple, fine Bolus three dragms, Species de gemmis frigidis a dragme and a halfe, Lignum Balsami halfe a dragme, Camfere foure greins: then make hereof pils with sirupe of Citrons, or with the iuice of Ribes. These following are yet more forcible: Take Paradise wood halfe a dragme, Tormentill two scruples, Diptamus one scruple, Zeduary and Lignum Balsami, of each halfe a dragme, Saf∣fron one scruple, Cloues fiue greines, Verueine halfe a drag. burnt Harts horne two scruples, red Saunders one scruple, red Corall and Sorrell séedes, of each half a drag. fine Bolus three ounces, Species de gemmis frigidis thrée drag. Camfere foure greines, make pils hereof with si∣rupe of Citrons, or with the iuice of Ribes. Others that are good for the heart: Take Citron séedes two dragmes, Iacincts, Smaragdes, Doronicum, and bones of a Stags hart, of each one scruple, Zeduarie, wood of Paradise, of each two scruples, the rootes of fiue-leafed grasse, or Cinquefoile, of each a quarter of an ounce: then make pils hereof with the sirupe of Citrons. Of all these foresaid pils may be vsed which you please, and when you please, therewith to comfort the heart, and defend it from all ill ayre. There are also diuers Confections prepared for preseruatiues, that you may vse in stead of pils, to wit, morning and euening, whereby nature is ayded, thereby the better to withstand the pestilent ayre. For these, take Terra sigillata, white Diptamus, fine Bolus, Myrrhe, Wormwood, Rue Sca∣bious, Pimpernel, Sorrel, and Zeduarie, of each a dragme, Aristology, Tormentill, and Bay∣berries, of each a dragm and a halfe, fiue or sixe kernels of Walnuts, ten or twelue new Figges, Mithridate and Treacle, of each an ounce, Saffron and Camfer, of each a scruple, Vnicornes
horne, prepared Pearles, bones of a Stags hart, burnt Harts horn, and Smaragds, of each one dragme and a halfe, peeled séeds of Citrons halfe an ounce, Mace one dragme: powne all that is to be powned, and then temper all together with sirupe of Citrons to the consistence of a con∣fection. This Consection killeth all venime of the plague, and preserueth men very maruellous∣ly from her infections, if they take thereof in the morning and euening, to wit, in winter time with a draught of Malmsey, and in Summer with Rosewater. But if you haue not these con∣fections, then vse that of Nuts and Rue, that herebefore is described in the 11. §. Another confection that is most excellent: take Iuniper berries, Cloues, Elecampane rootes, and Nutmegs, of each one dragme, Aristology and Gentian, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Purslaine and Sorrell seedes, Doronicum, red and white Behen, Spodium de Canna, bones of a Stags hart, Paradise wood, red & white Corall shauings of Iuorie, Bayberries, Mastick, and Rue, of each two scrup.

Pauli, and fine Bolus, of each two drag.

Item, take conserues of Roses, of Violets, of Burrage and of Buglosse, of each halfe an ounce, Smaragde, Iacinct, and Pearles, of each one dragme, bones of a Stags hart, filed Gold, Citron seedes, fine Bolus, and sealed Earth, of each halfe a dragme; powne all that is to be powned, and then make thereof a confection with sirupe of Citrons. Another: Take conserue of Roses, of Buglosse, of each an ounce and a halfe, Doronicum, bones of a Stags hart, Iacincts, Smaragdes, Saphirs, of each halfe a scruple, yellow Saun∣ders, Cinquefoile and Paradise wood, of each thrée dragmes, Sugar one ounce, wine of Gra∣nado, and sirupe of Limons, of each halfe an ounce, ten or twelue gold leaues; then mingle all together to the consistence of a confection. Another that is very good and approued: Take conserue of Roses, of Buglosse, and of Bur∣rage, of each sixe ounces, Doronicum. Zeduarie, Basill séede, Mace, Saffron, and Adiantum, of each one dragme, bones of a Stags hart, Iacincts, Smaragdes, and Saphirs, of each a scry∣ple, Pearles one drag. sixe leaues of beaten gold, sirupe of Apples, and of Citron peels, of each two ounces, Violet water three quarters of an ounce, white Sugar foure ounces; seeth the si∣rupe and Sugar with water enough, till it be as thicke as Hony, and afterwards temper the spices therewith: then beate it well together, and put thereto Rubarb one quarter of an ounce, that hath bene steeped foure and twenty howers in Malmsey: Lastly adde thereto Muske and Amber. of each foure greines: this being done, mingle them all together, and keepe it safe (be∣ing well stopt) in a glasse. Item, take Mithridate and Treacle (that at the least is ten years old) of each half an ounce, Citron seede, and fine Bolus of each halfe a dragme, Rose water, with the which Muscus is dissolued) as much as is needfull for a confection: hereof may you vse euery day one dragme. Also that are sound and whole, as also those that are infected, may vse the waight of a quar∣ter of an ounce of this confection following, morning & euening, without any daunger: Take Iacincts, Granadoes, Smaragds, Saphirs, Pearles, bones of a Stags hart, & Paradise wood, of each halfe a dragme, red and white Saunders, red and white Corall, burnt Iuory, Tormen∣till fine Bolus, Terra sigillata, Camfer & small filed gold, of each one scruple; beate them all to∣gether very small, and then take Sugar sixe ounces, that is sodden with Rose water to a sirup: then temper it so thicke as you will haue it, with sirupe of Citrons. Men may vse also other∣whiles in stead of this confection, two or three dayes together, of this drinke following, which also is a wonderfull preseruatiue against the plague, and may be vsed as well of young as of old folke, yea also of young children, and women with child: Take fine Bolus a dragme, and a halfe, beate it to fine powder, and drinke it with white wine and Rosewater, very warme in the morning: and eight daies after you must take a dragme of Treacle or Mithridate, in the winter with wine, and in the summer with Rosewater.
These foresaid medicines are not onely good against the plague to come, but also against that that hath alreadie infected. And forasmuch as those foresaid confections are made of many costly things, that may be too deare for the common people: for this cause haue we of purpose described the confection of Nuts and Rue, which they may vse in stead of these. Or take the kernels of Nuts, Rue and Iuniper leaues, of each a like quantitie; powne them all well together, and with Vineger make there∣of a confection, whereof euery morning you may take the bignes of a Nutmeg. In like manner may one also prepare this following: take eight and twentie or thirtie Nut kernels, and forty or two and forty Figs, Wormwood, Rue, Scabious, and Sorrel, of each half a M. Aristologie two dragmes and a halfe, Tormentill, Pimpernel, and white Diptamus of each one dragme, fine Bolus halfe a dragme, red and white Corall, Sorrell seedes, of each halfe a dragme, Citron séedes one dragme, Iuniper berries thrée dragmes; chop and stampe all that must be stampt, and hereof with clarified Honie make a confection: hereof may one take at one time the bignes of a Walnut. Also make another, which is called ye confection of Iuniper berries, as followeth: Take Nut kernels, Iuniper berries, of each two ounces, beate them wel together, put thereto foure oun∣ces of clarified Honie, and temper with it, Cinnamom, Ginger, Mace, and Cloues, of each a dragme, white Diptamus, Tormentill, Zeduarie, Citron peels, Rue, Carduus Benedictus, and S. Iohns woort, of each a quarter of an ounce, Cardamome, Paradise wood, blacke Coriander, Angelica, white and red Behen, fine Bolus, and sealed Earth, of each a drag. then mingle them all together. If the quantitie of Nut kernels, Iuniper berries, and Hony be too little, then may you take twice so much. And for the common sort it is also excellent good, that euery morning he do take eight or ten Iuniper berries that haue bene steeped in Vineger. Now follow certaine powders that preserue men from the Plague: but (as hath bene said before) great regard is to be taken in time of the plague, that the heart may be defended from al pestilent infections as much as is possible. To this end are all the bouesaid medicines, also ma∣ny powders, confections, cordiall waters, and other such like, as herafter follow prescribed: Take Rubies, Granats, Iacincts, Smaragdes, and Saphires, of each half an ounce, white and red Corall, and shauings of Iuorie, of each three quarters of an ounce, shauen Harts horne, and Sorrell séedes, of each halfe an ounce, prepared Pearles a quarter of an ounce, Saffron ten greines, beaten gold foure leaues; mingle them all together.

These following do the Apothecaries call Species liberantes, that are very much esteemed, and much vsed at Ausburg, by reason they defend the heart and all inward parts very maruellously against all venimous ayre; they are made in this manner: Take prepared Bolus and sealed Earth, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Tormentill, Sorrell seede, séede of Endiue, péeled seedes of Citron, and prepared Coriander, of each three dragmes, red, white, and yellow San∣ders, prepared Pearles, red and white Corall, yellow Amber, shauen Iuorie, bones of a Stagges hart (that hath bene stéeped a while in Rosewater) red and white Behen, Doronicum, Cardamome, Mace, Paradise wood, Cinnamom, Saffron, Zeduarie, and Cassie wood, of each a dragme, Emrodes, Saphires, Granates, and silke Wormes nests (chopped as small as may be) of each a scruple, Camfer fourteene greins, Muske and Amber, of each sixe greines, Sugar candie, and Sugar pennets, of each a quarter of an ounce: beate all very small, and mingle it together: ye shall giue one dragme of this powder in the winter with wine, and in summer with Sorrell water. The Emperours powder against the Plague: Take Pimpernell, Gentian, Tormentill, Dragon, Rue, Wormwood, Nut kernels, prepared Granats, and Iuniper berries, of each a like much; make them into powder, and vse it vpon a tosted péece of bread. If you will make a con∣fection of this powder, then put thereto Rose vineger, and Treacle, as much as shall suf∣fise.
Another powder: Take fine prepared Bolus one ounce and a halfe, Cinnamom one ounce, Tormentill, and white Diptamus, of each halfe an ounce, Pimpernell, Angelica, and Gentian, of each a quarter of an ounce, prepared Coriander thrée dragmes, Saffron, Sealed earth, Citrō péeles, red and white Behen, red Corall, yellow Saunders, shauen Iuorie, & prepared Pearls, of each a quarter of an ounce, burnt Iuorie, Paradise wood, and bones of a Stags hart, of each two scruples, Granates, Saphires, Iacincts, Emrods, and Rubies, of each halfe a dragme, Spike of Indie thrée greins, Amber sixe greines, Muske two greines, Camfere sixe greines, Sugar as much as all the rest do weigh: temper them well together and make them into a sub∣till powder, and vse it as before. Another like vnto this: Take fine Bolus very small beaten two ounces, Tormentill, Doro∣nicum, Diptamus, and red Saunders, of each one dragme, shauen Iuorie, burnt Iuorie, and Ci∣tron péeles, of each halfe a drag. Pearles two scruples, Rubies, Emrods, Granates, Saphires, and Iacincts, of each one scruple, bone of a Stags hart a dragm, Vnicornes horne halfe a scru∣ple: temper them together and giue halfe a dragm hereof at once. You may if you will put Su∣gar vnto it. Item: take Citron séedes, and Sorrell séedes, of each two dragmes, Diptamus, Gentian, and Tormentil, of each two dragms and a half, fine Bolus, and Cinnamom, of each one ounce, Pearles, Saphirs, and bones of a Stags hart, of each one dragme, red, white, and yellow San∣ders, and small Basill séedes, of each a dragme and a halfe, make powder therof. But if you wil make a Confection of it, then take an ounce and a halfe of the foresaid powder, and twelue ounces of Sugar: and when you haue taken of it, then drinke a draught of Sorrell water af∣ter it. Montagnana writeth, that he neuer saw any that haue died of the plague, which diligently vsed this medicine. Of all these foresaid powders may also Manus Christi, or Sugar cakes be made. The com∣mon custome is to take one ounce and a halfe of powder, and twelue ounces of Sugar. When the Arch Duke Maximilian that now is Emperor of Rome tooke his iourney into Spaine, then was this powder following ordained for him as a preseruatiue against all bad ayre: take Zeduarie, Cloues, Nutmegs, Myrtle kernels, Cinnamom, & Ginger, of each a quar∣ter of an ounce, Gentian, Diptamus, Tormentill, Elecampane rootes, and Aristologie, of each a drag. and a halfe, Nutmegs, Sage, Rue, Balme, Pionie seedes, Citron séedes, Sorrell séedes, Basill séedes, Bayberries, Masticke, Doronicum, Frankinsence, fine Bolus, Sealed earth, and burnt Iuorie, of each half a drag. bones of a Stags hart, red Corall, and Pearles, of each one scruple, conserue of Buglosse, and of Burrage, of each halfe an ounce, Rosewater and Scabious water, of each thrée ounces; then mixe with them ten greines of Camfere, and boile them with eight and twenty ounces of white Sugar to the consistence of a confection: and when the same beginneth to be cold, then temper the species with it, and so make Manus Christi of it. These Sugar cakes following are very common at Heydelborough in high Germanie: Take Species Diamargariton a quarter of an ounce, Liberantes foure scruples, Zeduarie, and Citron peeles, of each one dragme, Doronicum, Angelica, and Pimpernell, of each halfe a dragme, Cou∣chenele two scruples, Cinnamom a dragme and a halfe, Cloues one dragme, Vnicornes horne halfe a dragme, Smaragdes ten greines, Muscus two graines, beaten Gold, thrée leaues, white Sugar nine ounces: dissolue the Sugar in water wherein red crimson silke is sodden, and make hereof Manus Christi. This following do the Phisitions call Alexipharmacum, that is, such a medicine that can ex∣pell all manner of venim, and whatsoeuer els is hurtfull to the body: Take Sallad oyle of one hundred yeares old or more, & if you cannot get such oyle, then boyle it vntill it waxeth eager & sharpish, thirty ounces, Turpentine 3. ounces, uphorbium, and Beuercod, of each halfe a drag. dew or raine Wormes (washed in Wine) halfe an ounce: afterwards put therein eightie or nintie Scorpions, and in the Dog daies take the Adder that is called Vipera cut in péeces, and let the oyle seeth in boyling water the space of foure howers, afterwards set it ten daies in the hot sunne. This being all done, adde to it Zeduarie, Gentian, Tormentil, white Diptamus, Ari∣stologie, and Rubarbe, of each halfe an ounce, Hollihocke leaues, Saint Iohns woort, Dane∣wéede, and Rosemarie, of each halfe a handfull. Treacle and Mithridate, of each half an ounce; then powne all that is to be powned, and temper them together; & then being close stopt, burie
it in horse dung for the space of thrée moneths. Lastly, presse it through a strong strainer, and all that you can get out shall you reserue in a pelter bottell. This medicine must be vsed in manner as followeth: to wit, that you take it cold, and not warme. It suffiseth also to annoint the hart, the pulses, and the temples of the head but thrice a day, leauing two howers only betwéene euery iuunction. At Pisa is a custome that the Magistrates euery yeare giue to the Vniuersitie two prisoners that haue deserued death for to anatomize, which is a good meanes to proue this medicine. When as they giue vnto one of these prisoners one scruple of Rats bane, and eight howers be∣fore his death annoint him with this salue as is aforesaid; then find they indéed that such men might afterwards liue fiue daies longer. These foresaid receits haue bene of others described but falsly. This mixture following is highly commended to annoint withall: Take Amber halfe a dragme, Annis séede halfe a scruple, Paradise wood, Laudanum, red and white Behen, of each a quarter of an ounce, Mace, and Citron péels, of each two dragmes and a half, Nutmegs, white Corall, red and white Saunders, of each one dragme, beaten Gold six leaues, Basil water, wa∣ter of Saffron flowers, and Rosewater wherein Muske is dissolued, of each fiue ounces, Vine∣ger two spoonefuls, Malmsey two ounces; temper them well together a great while, and an∣noint oftentimes the pulses therewith, the temples of the head and the face, and reserue it being stopt very close. In Saxonie they haue a salt of Wormwood, called Sal Absynthij, which will free and defend men from the plague without any further care. We will also here describe certaine drinkes against the plague: First, it is not vnknowne what power there is in the compounded Aqua vitae against the plague, and against al venimes, as is sufficiently rehearsed in the eight part. An approoued water: Take Tormentill, Valerian, Pimpernell, Dragon, Diptamus, Sealed earth, fine Bolus, dry Vineger dregs, and long Pepper, of each half an ounce, Saffron a drag. Amber halfe a drag. Treacle one ounce, Nux vomica, and Carduus Benedictus, of each thrée quar∣ters of an ounce; pown them all small together, and powre as much thin white wine vpō them as you please; let it so stand fowre dayes, and of this drink a spoonefull at once, sweate vpon it, and fast fiue howers after it. For the common people you may prepare this following: Take Valerian, the roots of great Burs Bardana, Diptamus of Candy, Gentian, Bistorta, Tormentill, and Pimpernell, of each a like much: beate all together grosly, and powre Aqua vitae vpon it as much as wil couer it; in∣solate it fourtéene daies long, stirring it about euery day. This being done, then must you not take aboue a spoonefull of it at once. Also you may distill it, and vse it by it selfe: but by my coun∣sell this should not be vsed in Summer. This drinke following hath bene approued of many thousands: Take in May the rootes of great Burs, called Bardana sixteen ounces, of the middle rind of the Ash trée two M. chop it smal together, and distill it: giue of this water to drinke thrée or foure ounces, to wit, when he is thought to be infected of the plague: it is also wonderfull good against all biting of madde Dogges. Another: Take Rue, Wormwood, Roses, and Iuniper berries, of each a handfull, twentie or twentie fiue kernels of Nuts; stamp these all together to pap, powre wine and vineger ther∣on of each one pint and stop it right: then let it séeth in Balneo foure and twenty howers: this being done, then straine it, and of this giue euery morning fasting two spoonefuls to drinke. I∣tem, take fifteene or sixtéene heads of Léekes, peele off the vppermost shales, and stampe them small, and afterwards mixe thin white wine with them, and vineger of Rue, of each a good pint or a pint and a half, and good Treacle one ounce, and kéep it close stopt in a glasse. And when you will vse it, then giue therof a spoonfull or twaine to drinke in the morning betimes. It dri∣ueth out sweate, and expelleth venimous ayre. This sirupe following is highly commended: Take Citron péels, rootes of Capers, Verueine, red Saunders, and burnt Iuorie, of each a quarter of an ounce, Cloues, Buglosse, Balme, Burrage, Calmus, of each halfe an ounce, Sor∣rell, Liuerwoort, & Mallowes, of each thrée drag. Cicory séeds, Melon séeds, seeds of Pompeons, Gourds, of Cucumbers, and Violets, of each 2. ounces, Thymus, Epithymus, of Polypodie; Miro∣balani Chebuli, and yellow Mirobalanes, of each one ounce, Agaricus and Rubarb of each halfe
an ounce, the iuice of Fumitorie, of Wormwood, of Danewéede, and of broad Plantaine, of ech sixe ounces, the iuice of Quinces eighteen ounces, Diagridium a quarter of an ounce, white Su∣gar twenty foure ounces; make hereof a sirupe: and when it is almost sufficiently decocted, then powre thereto foure ounces of the iuice of Quinces, and then let it boile till his consistence. This sirupe is maruellous good in the time of the plague; for it drieth the body moderatly, and cleanseth also the same of all superfluous humors: it strengtheneth the heart, the liuer, and also the inward parts: You may take of it one ounce and a halfe, or two ounces euery wéeke with the water of Buglosse, early in the morning, and then to sléepe thereupon a while, or at the least to lie still an howre after it. Hitherto haue we described many medicines, whereby the healthie (in time of the plague) may be preserued. All these things must be vsed in good order, like as these medicines following also, to wit, that you vse sometimes the one, and somtimes the other, and not alwaies one and the selfe same, that nature not accustome her selfe to it, and in the end do thinke the remedie to be rather a foode than a medicine, so that it by that meanes cannot haue her operation. The sixteenth Chapter. VVhen any are infected with the Plague. NOw this Chapter shall onely intreate of those that are alreadie infected with ye Plague, be it by what meanes soeuer they haue first gotten the same; as with Agues, swellings, plague sore, or such like. Of the Ague in the Plague. §. 1. THe Plague commonly commeth alwaies first with an Ague, wherupon presently followeth the Tokens or Carbuncles. Of the causes of these twaine hath bene spoken before; whereby it hath also bene said, that in the time of heate, as in the Dog daies (when the heate of man is drawne inward) that the heart as then is inflamed through an vnnaturall man∣ner of heate: then also the outward ayre (wherein we continually abide) increaseth the heate, and the heart is so set on fire, that the heate spreadeth ouer the whole bodie, and thereby quick∣ly causeth a pestilent Ague, especially if there be such humors in the bodie that are subiect to in∣flammation, but if the bodie be not thereto inclined, then can there be no cause (how violent soeuer it be) of such infection. Of the signes whereby this sicknes is knowne. §. 2. EVuen as all other sicknesses haue their certaine signes, whereby they are knowne, so is it with this venimous ague, which manifesteth her selfe with seuen kinds of accidents: whereof the first is, an vnnaturall cold and shaking, whereupon straight way followeth a great heate; albeit the same oftentimes altereth, so that sometime first the heate and afterwards the cold insueth. Secondly, let this happen howsoeuer it will, there followeth alwaies after it a great and intollerable thirst. Thirdly, bitternesse and vnsa∣uorines of the mouth. Fourthly, losse of appetite. Fiftly, heauines of all parts of the bodie, with wearisomnes and sleepe. Sixtly, a binding of the bodie and the going to the stoole by constraint, and with great stench: the vrine also commeth with a great quantitie and stinketh much: lastly, bereauing of sléepe. And albeit these foresaid signes manifest sufficiently the violence that na∣ture suffereth, it is to be wondred at neuerthelesse that at the first neither by the nature and qualitie of the ague, nor by the pulse, nor by the vrine this infection is to be discerned, for it of∣ten hapneth that the vrine of all men so infected is very like the vrine of the sound, and that the heate is also much slower and obscurer than that of any other agues, and the pulse also quiet and scant to be felt. Now when all these signes or any of them shall appeare, or that there be a plague sore, or other signes mo, then all auncient and later Phisitions conclude with one consent; that there
is nothing more profitable and requisite than that the patient do sweate well, and be delt with∣all, as hereafter followeth. By what meanes the patient is prouoked to sleepe. §. 3. FIrst, they ordaine these confections following, whereof shall be taken the quan∣titie of an hasell nut: Take one ounce of Treacle, Pimpernell, Gentian, Bistor∣ta, Tormentill, Sage, Rue, Wormwood, Iuniper berries, and Nut kernels, of each one dragme, stampe them all together, and then with vineger make it into a confection. Or vse this confection following, called Bezoarctica, one dragme, warmed in Sorrell water, or in water of Carduus Benedictus, at what time soe∣uer you will, and then couer him very well, and let him sweate thrée or foure howers (if he be able) for the more he sweateth, the better hope is there of his recouerie. But if the patient be vnder the age of twelue yeares, yet aboue fiue yeares, then must you giue him halfe a dragm, and further deale as is abouesaid. It is also néedfull, if the patient may abide it, that he sweate morning and euening, this confection is made as followeth: Take of the best Treacle and Mi∣thridate, of each halfe an ounce, Pimpernell and Angelica, of each tenne greines, Cardamome fiue greines, Camfer thrée greines, Cinnamom ten greines, put them all together. But if you haue none of this confection at hand, then a dragme of Treacle or Mithridate with any of the foresaid waters, or take of the golden Egge, which is described after two manner of waies, as followeth: Take a new laid Hen egge, and make a little hole in the top that the white may issue out,The golden Egge. and the yolke tarrie within, then fill it vp with good powdred Saffron, and shut too the hole on the top againe with the white of ye egge and egshell, then rost it by a mild fire so long as the shell will hold, and that it be all cleane browne. This being done, take off the shell, and powne the inner part very small, then mingle it with white Mustard séedes, Diptamus, and Tormen∣till, of each a quarter of an ounce, Nux vomica a dragme: lastly, adde good Treacle to it in waight as heauie as all the rest, then temper it all together two or thrée howers together, and make hereof a hard confection, which men call the golden Egge, and will remaine good twenty or thirtie yeares. The second: Take all that is before rehearsed except the quantitie of the Treacle, and put thereto Angelica, Pimpernell, Zeduarie, Camfer, and good Treacle, of each as much as of the other, and that in waight: but I thinke that there is too much Camfer, and too little Treacle. Whereas it is not a little auailable to know how this confection is to be vsed, therefore you shall vnderstand, that whensoeuer this sicknesse first beginneth with cold, then must you (if it be a man) before that twelue howers be past, giue to him the waight of a duckat, to a wo∣man as much as a Rhenish gildern wayeth, and a child or boy half as much, with a smal wine. But if this sicknes taketh one with heate, then take in the place of wine water of Cicorie, or if you cannot get it, then take halfe wine halfe vineger, and sweate vpon it. This confection may be vsed at all times against all bad humors and venime, yet then must the Nux vomica be left out. In the fift part, the twelfth Chapter 1. §. is likewise shewed how to prouoke sweate. The auncient Phisitions accustomed to vse this powder following for to cause sweate: take Vale∣rian rootes thrée quarters of an ounce, Gentian, white Diptamus, and drie Rue, of each one ounce, good Saffron one dragm, red Corall, and Mace, of each a dragme and a halfe, temper it, and powne it all together, and giue one dragme thereof with a draught of wine. A maruellous oyle for to procure sweate: Take a glasse bottell as bigge as you will, fill the same halfe full of Elder flowers, & put thereon the third part of Hollihock flowers, or flowers of Ebulus, & againe therupon a third part of the flowers of S. Iohns woort, so that with these thrée things the glasse be full: this being done, powre thereo old Sallad oyle (the older the better) and at last stop it very close, & so let it stand all the Somer a sunning with this oyle must you rub the bodie very warme thrée or foure times a day. It hath bene approued, that this oile through the abundant sweate that it prouoketh, expelleth all contagion of the Plague. Here follow now Diaphoreticall potions: Take Rue, Wormwood, and the vppermost tops of the Blacke berries, of each a handfull, Celandine a handfull and a halfe: powre thereon a
pint of Vineger, afterwards stop the pot very close that there come out no vapor, and then let the third part seeth away; then straine it out, and kéepe it close stopt, and when any are infected with the Plague, or in any wise poysoned, then giue him of this drinke, to wit, two or thrée ounces, and let him sweate after it, and not sléepe at all. The water of Geranium is also very good against all venime, and therfore good to be vsed in time of the Plague, whether there appeare any swelling or any other accidents or not. Some also commend this composition following to be an especiall remedie, and it is indéed not to be disdained. Take a great Onion, cut off the top, and make a hole therein, and then fill him with Treacle and the iuice of Rue and Vineger, of each one dragme, then close the toppe too againe with the péece which you clipt and cut off, and fasten it with two sticks, & wind it in wel towe: this being done, rost it in the hote ashes till it be very mellow, afterwards stamp it to pap, and then straine it through a cloth, and it will be a broth, then preserue this broth till time of neede. If one then be found that he be poysoned, then giue him a dragm therof, and hold tosted bread sprinkled with vineger before his nose that he cast it not vp againe, and let him lye downe on the bed that he may sweate. But it is to be noted, that sléepe in sweating is forbidden and hurtfull, wherfore the patient shall not sléepe till the sweate be gone, that the venim hasten not towards the vitall parts, afterwards he may sléepe, that he waxe not impotent and weake, yet he is otherwhiles to be awaked. And if the age or might of the patient will permit it, then ought he to be let bloud, that the contagious matter which corrupteth the bloud, and hurteth the principall parts, might be let out, and the inflammation lessened. Herein do many Phisitions and Barbers dote and erre very absurdly, which straight way as soone as they suppose it to be the Plague, not perceiuing any signe thereof, begin their cure with letting of bloud. For albeit that it may not be delayed too long, yet ought it not rashly to be done by reason of the former causes. When the patient thus sweateth, then must the same be wiped from his face with a cloth, and hold before his nose rose Vineger, Rose water, and such like: also let the ayre of the cham∣ber be cleansed and perfumed with fire or sprinkled with Vineger; but especiall héede must be taken that the sweate strike not againe into the bodie. As he hath now sweat wel and is wiped cleane, then must he be laid in another bed: for the exchange of beds is very good; for thereby they are the lesse infectious, which otherwise increaseth stil more and more, and is more hurtful for the diseased person. Some are of opinion that the patient should not take any thing within an hower after his sweate, that nature first might be able to indure and beare it the better. Besides the ayring and sprinkling of the chamber, it is good counsell for the rich, that there be a cloth wetted in Rosewater, and hanged in the night before the bed of the patient; and when it is drie that it be moistened againe. How to comfort those that are infected with the Plague. §. 4. FOr asmuch as there are many causes in this sicknesse wherby the patient may be weakened, which the disease of it selfe bringeth with it, as great heate, much watching, thirst, paine, sweate, & such like things mo: wherfore good regard must be had how the heart might be comforted, and naturall strength be maintai∣ned: for the which this water following is ordained for the common sort of people, which not onely strengtheneth, but also driueth out the sweate: Take new distilled water of the kernels of Nuts foure ounces, powdered Verueine one dragme, good Treacle, two scrup. Saffron seuen greines: then mingle it all together, and so giue it warme. It profiteth much also that the patient alwaies haue in his hand odoriferous things, where∣with the heart, the braines, and all inward parts may be comforted, and the bad vapors taken away; for the which this Pomander following is very commodious. Take red, white, and yellow Saunders, and Roses, of each one dragme, Saffron, and Cam∣pher, of each one scruple, Muske, and Amber, of each fiue greines; then make hereof a Poman∣der with Dragagant that is dissolued in Rosewater, and then bind it in red sarsnet as is before mentioned.
Of these Pomanders, as well hote as cold of nature are herebefore diuers described, where we haue treated of the preseruation of the healthie. And these sweating patients must not ab∣staine from meate, for that the emptinesse of the stomacke is very hurtfull for them; and what meate and drinke is good for them, that shall be shewed hereafter. If the sicke person be so weak and féeble that he may not be let bloud nor purged, then giue vnto him this drinke following, that shall do him good: Take white Diptamus, Tormentill, white Coral, Gentian, fine Bolus, Sealed earth, and Verueine, of each one dragme, beate them all very small together, and take therof one quarter of an ounce, good Treacle one dragm, iuice of Scabious foure ounces, Vine∣ger halfe an ounce. But if you cannot get the iuice, then take the water of Nut kernels, and let him drinke it warme: yet in winter giue him wine in stead of these waters. The next day giue to the patient fine Bolus tempered with as much conserue of Roses, and foure ounces of Sca∣bious water after it. Sometimes also must the common pils be vsed. There is also to be made this cordiall confection as followeth: Take prepared Rubies, Ia∣cincts, Granats, Smaragdes, fine Bolus, Pearles, bones of Stags hart, fine filed gold, and small filed Vnicornes horne, of each one scruple, raw silk that is cut very small, Roses, Amber, Citron péels, and shauen Iuorie, of each halfe a dragme, white Sugar dissolued in the iuice of Limons as much as you please, séeth the same as thicke as honie, and mingle the rest amongst it to a confection. Giue this to the patient two or thrée dragmes with fresh broth, for it streng∣theneth maruellous much all the vitall parts, it resisteth all vapours, and breaketh the force of the Ague. In like manner there are cordiall waters to be outwardly applyed, whereof some shall be shewed hereafter. Take Rosewater sixtéene ounces, water of Endiue, Buglosse, Nightshade, Baulme, and of Sorrell, of each eight ounces, Vineger, and good white Wine, of each thrée ounces, red, white, and yellow Saunders, of each one quarter of an ounce, Corall, and Roses, of each one dragm, burnt Iuorie, Saffron and Camfere, of each halfe a dragme, then mingle them all together, and so wetting in it a double cloth, lay it ouer the heart. Or take water of Buglosse, and of Sorrell, of each thrée ounces, water of Willow leaues, Roses, Wormwood, Grasse, Baulme, and of the wild Vine leaues, of each two ounces, Spec. Cordialium temperatarum a dragme and a halfe, Saffron eight greines, Myrrhe, Diptamus, Gen∣tian, Paradise wood, yellow Saunders, Basill séed, red and white Behen, Iacincts, and Sma∣ragdes, of each halfe a scruple, iuice of Limons thrée ounces, Vineger one ounce, Malmsey fiue ounces, put them all together. Item, take the water of Buglosse, of Scabious, Violets, and of Burrage, of each sixs ounces, Rosewater wherein Muske is dissolued eight ounces, Specierum Cordialium one ounce and a halfe, Camfere halfe a scruple, white Corall foure scruples, prepared Pearles a dragme and a halfe, beaten Gold eight leaues, Malmsey foure ounces. Note that you must temper the water and the Malmsey together: and when you haue ta∣ken twelue ounces of the same, then must you take a dragme of this powder and mixe with it, and vse it as is before rehearsed. Another: Take Sorrel water, and Carduus Benedictus water foure ounces, Vineger of Gillo∣flowers one ounce, Species de gemmis frigidis a quarter of an ounce, Saffron two greines, Cam∣fere fiue greines, Malmsey halfe an ounce, temper them all together. When as these cordiall waters are laid on the heart, then may you annoint the sicke bodies left breast pap with this salue following: Take one ounce of the best Treacle, iuice of Limons, and of Vineger, of each halfe an ounce, Saffron, and Camfere, of each one scruple; then mingle them together, and spread it on a cloth or on a red crimson clout. This following is stronger: Take good Treacle two ounces, Rubarbe, and Carlina, of each one drag. and a halfe, old oyle of Oliue twelue ounces, forty or 45. Scorpions: powne all that is to be powned, and then let it séeth in water in a pot alone fiue or sixe houres long; afterwards straine it through a cloth, and first annoint the heart, the pulses, and the temples of the head. Afterward he must be annointed vpon all outward signes or sores of the Plague, and at the last round about the necke: and this annointing must be done once euery sixe houres very warme: the chamber must also be kept fumed and continually sprinkled. We haue also made mention herebefore in the sixt part, the second chapter, and tenth §. and
shortly after in the Ague Hectica of many things wherwith sicke folkes are to be comforted and reuiued. What is to be done after sweating. §. 5. WHen as the patient hath sweat, is wiped, and laid in fresh bedding, then do some counsell to giue him out of hand one dragme of fine Bolus, to wit, with Rose water if a great heate be adioined, or with wine if without heate, and that not at one time onely, but euery day: but it importeth very much whether you haue the right fine and orient Bolus or not, for there are many kinds of earths vsed in stead of it. Further, let him take immediatly after his sweating, to wit, thrée mornings (one after ano∣ther) of these sirupes following, for the cooling of these hote agues, to warme the same first in hot water, and in case that he afterwards féele a sweating againe, then let him forthwith con∣tinue in his sweate if he can abide it. Take sirupes of Limons one ounce, sirupe of Citrons halfe an ounce, water of Carduus Bene∣dictus, of Sorrell, and of Burrage, of each one ounce, mixe them all together for a potion. And if so be that after the vse of these thrée potions the patient should be purged (which in this ague is seldome néedfull) then must it be done with this following: Take of the common plague pils ten greins lesse than a dragme, and ten greines of Agari∣cus, Rubarbe one scruple, then make hereof small pils, and giue them all to the patient at one time. Another regiment when any one is infected with the Plague. §. 6. FIrst, these pils following are to be giuen to the patient in the morning betimes: Take of the common plague pils a dragme and a halfe, that are formed with sirupe of Citrons, and then let the patient (if the infirmitie may beare it) sléepe af∣terwards a little: the next day after shall he thrée or foure dayes after other al∣waies in the morning betimes, take a dragme and a halfe of fine Bolus powde∣red either with wine or with Rose water, as the time of the yeare requireth. This is a maruel∣lous good medicine and without all danger, but onely that it somewhat bindeth the bodie, which may be preuented with mild Clisters, which must be made of oyle onely. It is not amisse for this intent to vse these confections following euery other day, which strengthen the bodie, and make it sound: Take good Treacle one dragm, prepared Smaragdes seuen greines, then mingle it with wine, and so giue it him. But if the partie can hardly take this, then let him vse one of these Sugar plates following: Take Iacincts, Granats, Rubies, Smaragdes, Saphires, and bones of the Stags hart, of each one dragme, red and white Saunders, and red Coral, of each one scruple, burnt Iuorie, fine Bolus, prepared Pearles, Sealed earth, and Vnicornes horne, of each foure scruples, filed gold one dragme, Sugar sod in Rosewater sixteene ounces, make it vp into Manus Christi, or Sugar plates, and take two or thrée dragmes of them at one time. As soone as the patient féeleth himself infected, let him presently take this potion following, and if he vomit not the same vp againe, but sweateth after it, then it is a good signe of amende∣ment, and a manifest token of health. Take white Diptamus, Tormentill, white Corall, Gentian, fine Bolus, Sealed earth, and burnt Harts horne, of each one dragme, Smaragdes, Camfer, and prepared Pearles, of each halfe a dragm, Myrrhe, Saffron, & Citron séedes, of each one scruple: beate all very small, and take of it a quarter of an ounce, Treacle a dragme and a halfe, Sorrell water, and good white wine, of each one ounce and a halfe, mixe them for a potion, and giue it to the patient warme lying in his bed, that he may sweate well, and that as long as he may suffer it: afterwards wipe him well, and lay him in another bed. But if the time of the yeare be cold, and the Ague not very hote, then may you put the more wine to the foresaid potion: and contrariwise, if it be hote weather, and the Ague hote also, then let Sorrell water be mingled therewith. But speciall care must be had that the patient cast not vp the potion agine, for the which
it is good, that there be a great cup set vnder his stomacke, without opening the skin, and some good sauour be holden before his nose, his hands dipt in cold water, or smell to tosted bread that is moistned with Vineger, and such like things mo. Some forbid that men in sweating shall neither eate or drinke; which were somewhat indéed if the patient be strong enough: but when he is féeble, then haue you for this a good direction before. How to purge those that are infected with the Plague. §. 7. IN the end of the foresaid fift §. we haue declared, that purging for this sicknes is not greatly commended: neuerthelesse if great néed require, then is there nothing more fit than the common plague pils, with somewhat tempered ther∣with. This potion following may also be giuen him with all safetie, for that it doth cleanse the bloud of all superfluities: Take of the confection Triphera Per∣sica and Manna, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Rubarbe one dragme, then mingle them together in foure ounces of Sorrell water. Or take Cassie and sowre Dates, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Confection of the iuice of Roses one dragme, then temper them together with Sorrell water. Item, take Tripheram Persicam halfe an ounce, prepared Agaricke and Rubarbe, of each one dragme, and mingle them as before. Another. Take the confection Diasena and Triphera Persica of each three dragms, Confectionis Hamech a quarter of an ounce, de succo Rosarum halfe a dragme, mingle them with the decoction of fruits, or with Buglosse water. But if the patient be so féeble that you dare not giue him a purging medicine, then let him haue a Clister of fresh broth or herbs, with Cassy, the yolk of an Eg, course Sugar, oile of Vio∣lets and salt. For all such diseases are the Conserue of Burrage and Buglosse very commodi∣ous, euen as they are also for all pestilent Agues, for they are both very comfortable; they re∣uiue the heart, resist venime, take away all weaknesse, make men glad, and cleanse the bloud. We haue before in the fourth §. written of other things mo that also do comfort the patient. This shall suffise that we haue spoken of the beginning of the Plague: we will now procéede and make mention of other accidents of these diseases, and teach their due remedies. Of the vnnaturall heate in the Plague. §. 8. AMongst the other seuen accidents of this contagion (that we haue heretofore spoken of, and are alwaies permanent with the pestilent Agues) there is com∣monly great headach adioyned. Now to strengthen the head and braines, haue we set downe many goodly instructions and directions, in the first part, the first chapter, §. 2. and also afterwards in the headach of heate. This potion following may you vse for the same: Take Tormentill, burnt Harts horne, red Corall, and fine Bolus, of each one dragme, prepared Pearles halfe a dragm, Camfer foure greines; beate them all together to powder, and then giue thereof the waight of a drag. tempered with Sorrell water. For this also serueth this Iulep following: take the iuice of Balme, of Burrage, Buglosse, Sorrell and of Cicorie, of each one ounce and a half, Rosewa∣ter and white Vineger, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, the iuice of Citrons or Limons halfe an ounce, Sugar as much as you please: séeth the sugar to a sirupe, and when you will vse the same, temper it with Barly water vnto a Iulep. Or take Conserue of Roses foure ounces, conserue of Buglosse two ounces, Species Triasantali one ounce and a halfe, burnt Iuorie, Sor∣rell, Melon seedes, péeled Gourd seedes, Citron séedes and Cucumber séedes peeled, and chopt small of each one ounce and a halfe, Sugar one ounce, Pearles foure scruples, and sixe leaues of beaten gold; then temper them well together for a confection: hereof may the patient vse as often as he will. For this also is good the Conserues of Burrage and Buglosse, of water Lillies, of the iuice of Oranges, and all that therewith may be made.
Of the vnsatiable and great thirst. §. 9. THe second accident of these pestilent Agues is thirst, that by little and little get∣teth the vpper hand, so that the diseased falling into a frenzines thereby, séeke to leape into the water, or into wels, thereby to coole themselues, and quench their thirst. To coole the same, and to allay it, you may vse this Iulep following: Take water of Sorrell, of Scabious, of water Lillies, and of Endiue, of each sixe ounces, Granado wine foure ounces, Vineger two ounces, the iuice of Limons two ounces and a halfe, white Sugar as much as you will; séeth it for a Iulep, and then let the patient drinke hereof as much as he thinketh good. Another: Take Buglosse water, and of Sorrell, of each sixe ounces, water of Cicorie, Endiue, and Willow leaues, of each foure ounces, sirupe of Citrons two ounces, sirupe of Vineger, and of Oxysacchara, of each one qunce, Granado wine eight ounces: let them boyle a little all together, except the Granado wine: this being clarified, put the Granado wine vnto it. In like manner is also good the sirupe of Citrons, Limons, S. Iohns grapes, or berries, Roses and Endiue, being mingled with some cooling water; or else with well water or Barley water. Item, Well water which hath bene once distilled: but aboue all things that can be deuised, is nothing better to quench the thirst, to withstand poyson, to comfort the heart, than the iuice of Limons or the same being pared, and cut in slices, and strewed ouer with Sugar, and so to vse them, and to take the liquor of them with a spoone. Item take Quince kernels one ounce, let them mollifie one whole night in eight ounces of Sugar water, then straine them: this being done, then temper therewith one ounce of the si∣rupe of water Lillies, and oftentimes vse it. As for the thirst, you haue diuers remedies thereto in the third part, the twelfth Chapter, and 10. §. which are altogether very good. And afterwards yet more, to wit, in the seuentéenth Chapter in Diabete, aad also in the description of the Agues. Of the bitternesse in the mouth. §. 10. THe third accident is the bitternesse of the mouth, which procéedeth of an inflam∣mation of the Gall, whereof we haue written more at large in thrée other places, to wit, in the third part, the eleuenth Chapter, and sixt §. Also in the fiftéenth Chap∣ter, and tenth §. Item againe, in the third part, the twelfth Chapter, and sixtéenth §. in which places you may reade it. All such patients must often hold the leaues of Sorrell in their mouths, or chew the séedes of the same. They may also very wel hold in their mouth Gum Arabiack, and swallow it downe by little and little. Of the want of Appetite to meate. §. 12. THe fourth accident in this Ague is the losse of appetite: whereas this sicknesse re∣quireth that the patient in this maladie, more than in any other, should be fed and kept in full strength and power; therefore it is néedfull in this disease, that the appe∣tite be stirred vp: whereof we in the third Chapter, and fift §. and before that in the third part, the eleuenth Chapter, and ninth §. haue treated at length. Especially you may prepare this stomachicall vnguent for it: Take Marmalade two oun∣ces, Mastick, Spica of Indy, Roses, red Corall, of each one dragme, Agaricus one dragme and a halfe, beate them well all together, and then annoint the stomacke therewith, or lay it on plai∣sterwise. Make also these Sugar plates following: take Marmalade made with Sugar two ounces, burnt Iuorie, Mastick, water Lilly flowers, and Roses, of each one scruple; rubbe the Marmalade in a mortar with sirupe of Citrons, and forme the cakes of the waight of halfe an ounce: then take hereof at all times, to wit, morning and euening.
Of the weaknesse and sleepinesse. §. 12. THe fift accident: Albeit we know well that nature grieuously striueth with this maladie, and thereby is wearied, weakened, and void of all strength, that is no wonder: for that cause it is highly commaunded that men must haue especiall regard to the strength of the patient, for the which also are diuers meanes set downe how to preserue his strength: so that it is néedlesse to rehearse the same at this present. Also it hath bene shewed in the fift Part, the seuentéenth Chapter, and in mo o∣ther places. Of the binding in the bodie. §. 13. THe sixt accident is the binding of the bodie, which is augmented by the heate. And to remedie the same are no strong things required, for strong purgations are not good in this sicknesse; yet if great néede be, you haue had before in the seuenth §. also in the third part, eleuenth Chapter, and 20. §. of the binding in the bodie diuers fit remedies, amongst which many easie and ooling purgati∣ons may be chosen: wherfore those that will cure this sicknes, let them beate 4. ounces of Sebestes, and stéepe them in water, and then giue to the patient many times of it to drinke. But if you will haue it more forcible, then stéepe with them the leaues of the lesser Iuie. Of the losse of sleepe. §. 14. NOw the seuenth accident of these pestilent Agues is losse of sléepe. For this must you take Violets, water Lilly and Elecampane rootes, of each one drag. séedes of Dill and Saffron, of each one scruple; make them into powder, then bind them vp in silke, and hold it continually before the nose, and smell to it. But of this haue you further discourse in the fift part, the twelfth Chapter, and sixt §. the which you may reade ouer, and vse it for this purpose. When a Plague sore appeareth. §. 15. WHen these foresaid meanes haue bene vsed, and that there appeare a Plague sore, then must you follow such things, as hereafter shall be set downe: but be∣fore we intreat of that, it is not demaunded in vaine whence this Plague sore Anthrax procéedeth, and of what nature it is: whereof the learned do write in this manner: Anthrax procéedeth of grosse and hot humors: which when they begin to pu∣trifie, then do they alter into a very hurtfull poyson: sometimes it is red, otherwhiles yellow and sometimes blacke, which is the very woorst and most venimous. For this manifesteth that nature is not strong enough to expell the venimous matter into the vtmost and furthest parts, whence of necessitie followeth, that the foresaid venimous humors are dispersed in the noble parts of the bodie inwardly. To remedie the same you shall begin with the letting of bloud, and that vpon the same side where the Plague sore is: Afterwards you must vse boxing and pricke the same déepe, whereby the grosse bloud may be drawne out: Lastly, you must purge the patient with some of these foresaid purgations, that are set downe before in the seuenth §. And speciall héede is to be taken, that for this Plague sore men lye not thereon (as men vse to do in other swellings, that the matter might be repelled) but attractiue things are to be vsed in this, for to draw the matter outwards, and that chiefly in the onely place of the plague sore. In like manner you must lay no hot nor moist thing theron, that ingender matter or corrup∣tion, but rather such things as drie greatly, and are reasonable cold by nature, that they may slake the heate, and hinder the vapor thereof. But if that there appeare any rednesse in any place of the bodie that would not impostu∣mate,
then are you to vse these things following: Take the inside of a Radish, the Radish leaues, Elderne flowers, and Bayberries, of each halfe a handfull; séeth them all together to pap, and then put halfe an ounce of white Mustard séede amongst it, afterwards make a soft plaister thereof, and lay it on the rednes. Item, take a blacke Cockrell, plucke him aliue ouer all his belly, and then bind his belly ouer the rednes, or ouer the swelling, for the naturall warmth of the bird will draw out the venime into him. Other slit his belly aliue, and so lay it thereon liuing. Or take a liuing Pullet, cut him vp vnderneath, and so bind him open against the swel∣ling: hold the head in thy hand, and so let him die. Then shortly after take another, and do as before. Further lay thereon ripening things and cure it, as the other swellings. Some lay thereon liue Frogs. Or take beaten Tormentill and Ginger, of each a like quantitie, and put thereto as much Treacle: afterwards put it into an Onion made hollow, and rost the same in a mild fire, or a∣mongst the ashes: lastly, stamp it to pap, and stirre thrée yolks of Egs amongst it, and then lay it thereon. And the better to draw out the rednes and swelling, the old Phisitions accustomed to make a plaister of Elderne leaues, of Scabious with the rootes, (to wit, of each alike) and to mingle the same with leauen, and so lay it thereon. Some do counsell also that you may temper therewith Salt, salt Peter, and Comfrey. And if you will haue it yet stronger, then are you to put powned Mustard séede thereto, and in like manner Pigeon dung, for that draweth out the swelling exceedingly, and maketh it great, all which aforesaid things you must often cause to be renewed. This next following hath very great force to draw out the venime: Take coles of the Til∣let trée, and make them glowing hote, afterwards sprinkle them with wine and vineger: when as they are slaked, then bind them warme in a cloth that is wetted in the foresaid vineger and wine, and wrung out againe, then lay these coles warme thereon, and when as the cloth is waxen yellow, then put it away, and take another. Item, take the rootes of Crowfoote brused small, and apply it on the place where the paine is, and the venime shall be drawne out very much. Others do vse this thing following, which is also maruellous good to draw out the Anthrax, that is, the Plague sore. Take a great Onion wherein Treacle is rosted (as is lately taught) or lay thereon a plaister of Oxycroceum, which is alwaies sound readie at the Apothecaries, and temper as much Diachilon cum gummis thereto. You may also make this plaister of leauen, Elderne flowers, and Treacle tempered together: for as it is admonished, this Treacle is aboue all other things to be commended for this sick∣nes, both inward and outward. Also all Chirurgians are here to be admonished, that they haue care to open these swellings before they be maturated, be it by the actuall cauterie, or by inci∣sion, and that they hold open the same as long as is possible. Item, the foresaid plaister of Diachilon onely is also very good for to maturate and ripen it. Or take the common plaister Diachilon thrée dragmes, and the iuice of Celandine, and make thereof a salue with a litle waxe. Or séeth Colewoorts with a little Bacon, and lay that there∣on, and when you sée that the swelling beginneth to impostumate, then are you to vse these pla∣sters, salues, and other things following: Take Hollihocke rootes, Scabious, and Mallowes, as much as néede requireth, séeth it, and stampe it all together to pap, and make thereof with Barrowes grease a mild plaister. Or temper wheate meale with Sallad oyle till it be a pap, and lay the same thereon. Another: Take Mallowes, Hollihocke rootes, Linséed, beaten altogether, & wheaten meale, of each alike much; seeth them all together, and powne it to grout: then mingle it well with Saffron, & so lay it warm theron. Now when as the swelling is once maturated, then you must open it out of hand, be it with an actuall or potentiall cauterie, or by incision, & so keepe the same open. In the meane time while this swelling is a healing and runneth as yet, you must daily giue the patient a spoonfull or twaine of Scabious water, or Rosewater with fine Bolus, and sometimes de Species liberantes, that thereby the poyson may be expelled from the heart. This plaister following doth also ripen very much: Take the middlemost rinds of Elderne, stampe them very small, and temper them with white Vineger, afterwards straine them through a cloth, and put thereto white Mustard séede beaten, but not too much, for it is very sharpe, and
make a pap thereof, and lay it on the swelling. Some suppose that this swelling of the Plague doth ripen much if one rub it ouer by day and night with a Saphire stone: but they that haue prooued it, and found it to be true, may write probtum est. If the Plague sore be of a very bad nature, then must the same be burnt out of hand, or a cor∣rasiue laid thereon: but if it be of no maligne nature, and not too hard, then must you vse drying things that corode not. Others bind Pullets or young Pigeons vpon it; and after that they haue set cups or Horse∣léeches thereon, wherewith they intend to draw out the venime, to strengthen the part, and to allay the paine. Some haue also for a custome, when as the Plague sore doth shew it selfe any where, that they make an issue with a corrasiue on some place of the patients leg, and keepe the same open, wherby al venimous matters therby might haue their course. When as now the Plague raig∣neth throughout a whole realme or countrey, then is it no bad counsel to do the same, when the patient hath first bene purged: and the same may be done on the right leg, foure fingers broade vnder the knée, on the outside of the leg. And this also is good for them that are troubled with the Gout. You may vse also in stead of the actuall or potentiall cauterie these salues following: take Cantharides two ounces and a halfe (the heads and wings pluckt therof) pown them small to powder, & temper it with one ounce of Barrowes grease, molten waxe, and hony, of each half an ounce, Camfer and Dragon bloud, of each a drag. and a half. This being well mingled, you must then spread thereof as much as will couer halfe a Doller vpon a cloth, and lay it ouer the place where the plaguefore appeareth, and it will in sixe or seuen howers draw a blister, then open the same that the matter may run out. This being done, let not the patient sleepe in ten or twelue howers, nor drinke wine in thrée daies. And for as much as through these accidents there is commonly great anguish and paine, then you must for allaying thereof vse this potion: take Treacle and Mithridate, of each halfe a drag. iuice of Scabious foure ounces, temper them all together, and giue it the patient to drinke méetly warme. Now for to kill the plaguesore: Take two or thrée yolkes of new laid Egges, and temper therwith about halfe an ounce of powned salt, and lay it theron new euery quarter of an houre. This reiterating must be so often done, because these plaisters are infected themselues through the venime, specially when the sore is broken. And if this be not enough, then take therewith Scabious, Comfery, and Mallowes, of each as much as you please, and therof make a plaister. And if that the sore would corrode further, then take fine Bolus, Dragon bloud, Vineger, Rose water, and the whites of Egs, as much as you please, and spread or lay the same plaisterwise round about the sore. Another: Take soot of the chimney, beaten salt, Sage, & Wheate that is chewed in ye mouth, of each a like much, and make a plaister thereof with blacke Sope. And if so be that this plague sore will not be killed through these foresaid things, then put thereto some Scabious and Com∣fery, and then clense afterward the sore with Mundificatiuum de Apio. Take Louage, one ounce, Barley meale two ounces, seeth them together in water to pappe, and put thereto Sallad oyle. You must also often wash this plague sore, to wit, with water of Carduus Benedictus, for that clenseth and healeth. These vlcers do many times spread wide abroad, whereby the flesh about is spoiled: for this, you must vse stronger remedies, as the salue of Egypt, Mercurium praecipita∣tum, or that which is better, burning with an hot iron or gold, whereby all putrifying is taken away, and the part fortified; for the actuall cauterie is an effectuall remedie that strengtheneth the parts that be of a cold nature, and doth defend them from putrifaction. Some also do scarifie the vlcers round about with a razor, and then spread fine Treacle therein. But as the blacke edges of these vlcers increase notwithstanding all these applications, then is it a signe that this venime is very strong, wherefore must you burne it déeper, and annoint the scarres with sweet Butter, or with pap of Hollihocke rootes, or of Mallowes and Butter together. But when the swelling or vlcers do yéeld matter, then must you lay no more maturatiues thereon, that ther∣by the matter augment not, and the healing be the more hindred. Lastly, you must haue care to ingender flesh and skin, wherof we will write and treate further in their due place. When as this Anthrax or plaguesore is thoroughly killed, then take Scabious, Comferie, of each a handfull, and a litle Salt, then temper it together with fresh Barrowes grease, and lay it warme thereon, and change it new thrée or foure times in a day and night.
Another: Take Scabious foure handfuls, Treacle one ounce, Barrowes grease one ounce and a halfe, stamp the herbs and make a plaister thereof, and refresh it often, euen as is afore∣said. You are to clense the vlcers with salue of Turpentine, iuice of Scabious, and the yolks of egs, especially when all other accidents are past. This plaister following is also especiall good: Take gréene Rue one handfull, leauen half an ounce, Pepper one dragme, Salt a dragme and a halfe, three or foure dry Figs, powne them all well together, and make a plaister thereof, and refresh it twice a day. It is of a wonderfull operation: for it will seperate the bad flesh from the good, and that in the space of two daies. When these swellings come to impostumat, and haue néed of clensing, then are you to vse ye salue De Apio, and therewithall you may prepare these things following: Take Turpentine (that hath bene often washed with water and Scabious) one ounce, Saffron seuen greines, and temper amongst it the yolkes of two egs. Or vse this thing following to clense and to ingender now flesh: Take Turpentine that is washed with the iuice or water of Scabious foure ounces, Barley meale one ounce, two yolks of Egs, Saffron, Sarcocolla, Mastick & Frankinsence, of each halfe a drag. temper it all together. Thirdly, take small beaten Sarcocolla halfe an ounce, and hony of Roses as much as néed re∣quireth for to make a mild salue thereof, and vse it so long till it be throughly whole. For this also may you sée what hath bene written in the fift part, the first chapter 16. §. And further in the fift part, the seuenth chapter, and 14. §. where this matter hath bene treated of at large. When as there is no plague sore perceiued. §. 16. IF there appeareth no Anthrax or plague sore, and yet neuerthelesse the pulse and the vrine sufficiently shewed that a pestilent Feuer were at hand, and that the patient by reason of his age and power may suffer well the letting of bloud, then must his Lyuer vaine be opened in the right arme. Other do counsell when as the Ague endu∣reth, and his strength good, that the Saluatella on his left hand should be opened, and to let out foure ounces of bloud. For letting of bloud in the Plague. §. 17. WE haue before declared that amongst all other remedies for this swelling, the letting of bloud is beneficiall, but to the end when néede requireth it be not o∣mitted, you shall obserue these instructions following. When as after sweating you find that any thing appeare (be it a blacke blister, or any thing else) and that the patient is aboue thirteene yeares old and be strong, then must you let him bloud on the same side, and vnderneath the swelling, and make a good issue that the bloud may issue forth the better. If the swelling appeare behind the eares, which the Phisi∣tions do call Parotidas, or Gemellos, euen as we in the first part the 9. Chapter 4. §. haue shewed, then must you open the head veine on the same side in the arme, and if it will not bléede, then must you open that veine in the other arme. Or if the swelling appeare in the arme pits, on the brest, or on the ribs, then must you open his Lyuer veine in the arme on the same side. Some giue counsell that there should be put thereto thrée or foure Leaches one hower after, that they might suck out a good deale of that venimous bloud. But if this Anthrax or plaguesore be any where about the priuities or in the groines, then must you let him bloud in the veine vpon the foote, or betwéene the great Toe and the next vnto it. And if that will not bléed, then must you open the veine in the other foote, and let out more or lesse according to the age and abilitie of the patient. Some also haue annointed the swelling behind the eares with Hens grease: after∣wards you must giue him the confection Philonium Persicum, yet at all times by the counsell of a learned Phisition: also in like manner the Trocisci de Carobe, and herwith we will conclude.
The gouernment of life in the Plague. §. 18. AS much as first belongeth to the meate: you must note, that it is not néedfull that one néede in a pestilentiall Feuer to forbeare meate, as in other hot and strong Agues, as in the Pleurisie, or continuall Ague, and other such like: but the néed requireth here, that there may be often giuen to the patient (yea as some suppose euery thrée or foure howers) to eate and drinke in ye time of the plague. And it hath indéed bene found, that all those that haue forced themselues to eate, were much sooner cured than the other; wherefore do they well, that féede such a patient often with light meates that are drie and cold by nature, wherby they may withstand the heate of the Ague by their cold, and the moisture of the bad and slimy humors by their drith. These are strained Pease, Barly pap, Oaten pap, Hasel nuts, Capon broth, Hen broth, or of any other young flesh, wherewith Buglosse, Burrage, and such like herbes are sodden, whereof you may make Panadella with grated bread. And it is to be generally noted, that you may dresse all his meate with sowre things, as with Vineger, Veriuice, iuice of Limons, and such like. But if the fresh broth be too swéete, then may you therwith temper two yolkes of egs, which are first to be beaten with Rose vineger, and so make thereof a sowrish broth. All sowre things are also good for it, for that they prouoke appetite, which presently is taken away in these Agues by the pu∣trifaction in these diseases, which specially féebleth the stomack, insomuch as very often they are addicted to vomit, whereby the patient will also be weakened: for if the patient can kéepe no meate in his stomacke, then can the bodie retaine no nourishment of the meate that is taken. But to returne againe to the wholesome meate for the plague, there are also good smal Damask prunes, conserues of Cherries, conserues of Raspes, and such like. Also all gréene herbes are to be stewed, to wit, Burrage, Lettice, Sorrell, with a litle beaten Saunders added thereto. The iuice of Limons, of Oranges, and of Citrons, is a speciall sauce for all his meates. The most commodious drinke that he may drinke is Barly water, the iuice of Limons, O∣ranges, Sorrell, Pomegranates, or tempered with the sirupe of the same. Also it may be sod∣den like a Iulep, and the sirupe tempered amongst it. The common sort may seeth amongst it Berberries, Sorrell with the rootes, or Quinces chopt small. But when the patient is wearie of this drinke, then may he vse a draught of Almond milke, or thin Béere; and he may also drink for this sicknesse Well water tempered with Rose vineger. Distilled waters, as the waters of Carduus Benedictus, Sorrell, Burrage, or water of Buglosse, are very good for him. Item, water wherein vnripe Grapes are sodden, or mixed with Veriuice: also the sirupes of Roses, of water Lillies, Violets, and of Cicorie, and their Iuleps, are much commended for this sicknes. And with all these foresaid meats and drinks is Manus Christi prepared with Pearles, for this maladie much commended. Item, conserue of Violets, of Roses, of Gilloflowers, and specially conserues of Cuckobread, taking the bignesse of a Walnut of it. Contrariwise, the patient must vtterly forsake wine, and all meates that are drest with Spices. Fish, Milke, and all rost meate is hurtfull vnto him, and after meate the patient must kéepe himselfe very quiet. Of a conuenient ayre for the Plague. §. 19. THe ayre that is good for such sick folks, must be cold and drie, because the sicknes requireth all coole things, and that by the drouth all putrifaction may be with∣stood. Therefore must the chamber (as it is said) be sprinkled with Rosewater and with Vineger wherein Saunders and Camfere are tempered. Item, the chamber must be sprinkled with all cold and fragrant herbes and flowers, and in case there be any bad sauors or vapors in the chamber, then are the fuming candles, or odoriferous cakes to be vsed, whereof we haue largely written before, and shewed how they are to be made. Besides these, it is also good counsell that there be kept a good fire bur∣ning in the same house, to wit, of Iuniper wood, or any other swéet wood. But if so be there be no bad ayre in the patients chamber, then are you not to kindle any fire in that chamber, but rather vse any cold and odoriferous things; and you may hang clothes that are made wet in Rose∣water, or Rose vineger, and wrung out againe here and there about his bed or couch.
How they shall gouerne themselues that escape this Sicknesse. §. 20. AS for all them that recouer from this Plague or any other lingring sicknesse, all things are good that strengthen the stomack, and prouoke appetite to meate, and mildly open the bodie, as these confections following: Take Mirabalani Chebuli, Indi, Rubarb, Cinnamom, Carduus Benedictus, and Cloues, of each one dragme, Masticke a quarter of an ounce, Aloe thrée dragmes: mingle them all together with the iuice of Mints wherein halfe a dragme of Agaricke hath bene steeped, then take thereof morning and euening the bignes of a Chesnut. For this may you also looke the foresaid third Chapter, and twelfth §. where you may find a further discourse of these causes: and further if it be néedfull (as is rehearsed) then looke in the second part, the eleuenth chapter, where touching these things a perfect direction is giuen. The 17. Chapter. An exhortation for them that keepe these Patients. FIrst, they that assist and kéepe them that are infected with the Plague, must haue care that the patient be laid vpon a high couch or bed, that the venimous damps and stenches may rest aboue, and be the lesse hurtfull to the standers by. And it were also not amisse that there be a burning fire alwaies betweene the patient and the standers by. If there be a chimney in the chamber, then looke what is spoken thereof before. Secondly, when one commeth neare or toucheth the patient, then must his mouth be kept close shut, and draw his breath onely at his nose. He shall annoint his nostrils with wine wherewith fine Treacle is tem∣pered. The standers by are also to vse euery other day the Plague pils euery time a dragme, or a dragme and a halfe. He must also take oftentimes Mithridate. Thirdly, fine Bolus preserueth men from all infection of the plague if a dragme and a halfe of it be taken with Wine and Rosewater. Fourthly, if you take as much of the golden Egge as the bignes of a Hasell nut one day one, and another day another: to wit, pils or any such like. All they that visit them that be sicke of the plague must wash their mouthes with Vineger, wherein Wormwood and Rue is sodden, before they come at them, and eate some Garlicke with a bit of bread. Further, they shal alway hold a Pomander in their hand before their nose. All what is described in the beginning of the Plague, to wit, how the healthie are to gouern themselues with them that haue the plague, is also very requisite for this purpose. All that is hitherto set foorth for this disease are very passing and good meanes, which God through his gracious goodnes hath ordained and created for the good and welfare of man, wher∣fore he will of vs for these his benefits be praised, and be acknowledged for the onely Phisition both of the bodie and of the soule: and therefore we ought especially to pray vnto him for his blessings, and thanke him for the gifts receiued; for without him all phisicke is in vaine, and of no effect. The 18. Chapter. Of the Scuruie, Scorbuticus Morbus. THe Scuruie which is called in Latine Icteritia nigra, or Scorbuticus Morbus, is none other but a spreading abroad of melancholick humors throughout the whole bodie, chiefly caused & procéeding of the obstru∣ction of the spléene. These sicknesses are for the most part incident vnto them that leade an idle life, and féed on grosse meates and drinkes. They that are burthened with this disease haue commonly a bleake and leadish color, their breath short with an oppression at the hart, and a lost appetite, wearisomnes of the whole bodie, the gums are blew &
swollen, quickly prouoked to bléed and putrifie; otherwhiles blew or greenish spots ouer all the bodie, stifnesse in the knées, and most commonly they haue blacke small speckles like  lts vpon the shins, and aboue that their vrine is commonly browne red. Thus to cure this sicknesse the patient is first to receiue an easie purgation, as the potion made of Decoctum laxatiuum, of Benedicta laxatiua, or of Sene leaues: this being done, then may one open his Median veine and let him bleed well, if he otherwise be full enough of bloud. The next day after you must prepare for him this gréene potion following, whereof he must euery day thrée or foure times take a good draught: to wit, in the morning and before noone one time, after dinner two times, and after supper and going to bed a good draught more. Take Becabunga and Watercresses, of each two handfuls, stampe them in a stone or wooden mortar to pap, powre thereto a pint of wine, and a pint of small Béere: afterwards stirre them all together, and straine them through a cloth, then giue thereof to the patient to drinke as is abouesaid: and you must continue this till that the patient be thorough whole. Another. Take the rootes of Horseradish, which is called Raphanus syluestris, as much as you thinke good, grate the same, or beat it small to pap, and powre vnto it the moyty Whay of milk, and the other halfe Rhenish wine, or you may take some small beere as much as you please, and then mingle it with stamped Horseradishes: afterwards straine it thorough a cloth, and drinke thereof thrée or foure times a day, as is aforesaid. Item, take Scuruigrasse two handfuls, or as much as you please, stampe it to grout in a stone or wooden mortar, temper it with as much small béere and wine as you thinke meet, or af∣ter as you can drinke it, for the stronger the better: lastly, straine it thorough a cloth, and drink thereof as aboue. And if it come to passe, that in this sicknesse of the Scuruy, the gums of the patients mouth were vtterly spoiled and putrified: then wash the mouth with wine, and annoint the gummes with sirupe of Mulberries, and with hony of Roses; and if néed so required, then must you an∣noint your gums with the salue of Egypt, called Ʋnguentum Aegyptiacum. This may suffise for the cure of the Scuruie. The 19. Chapter. Of the detestable sicknesse, Drunkennesse. IT will perchance offend the gentlemen drunkards, that I haue here put their sicknes of drunkennes after the infectious Plague, and Agues, and that I haue compared their sicknes to those: but I will omit here ye lose of euerlasting life, disdaine of humanitie, and credite, consumption of worldly wealth, strife, murther, blasphemy of God, disclosing of secrets, whoredome, and many more vngodly works that ensue thereof: where∣fore we will here onely treate of the hurt that the body may hereby take thereof, and let other iudge afterwards, whether this sicknesse be not worse than the Ague, yea worse than the Plague it selfe. For Salomon speaketh not in vaine, ye Drunkennes hindreth all wisdome, which cannot be otherwise confirmed than that it maketh a man a foole; darkneth it not the vnderstanding? in feebleth it not the brains, ye memory, & all the sences? bringeth it not more forgetfulnesse with it, than is perceiued in young children? Behold only how the hands, the féete, the head, yea the whole bodie tremble and quake, how the sight is darkened, the toung stammereth, and how that there is not one member of the body that is a∣ble to discharge his dutie aright. Yea, say they, this sicknesse hath neither néed of the Phisitions nor Apothecaries counsel, make thereof as waighty a sicknes as you can, it may be holpen with a very pleasant medicine, that is, with a sweet sleepe. Whereto I say and answer: Oh good drunkard, there followeth with the time some other thing thereof, to wit, that thereby the good complexion of your Liuer is spoiled, so that it doth not ingender any good bloud, but other bad humors, wherby the Dropsie afterwards ensueth, or it doth so inflame the same with his slimi∣nesse, that the whole body will be filled with Cholera, that lastly spoileth and fireth the whole masse of bloud, wherof then is caused fearfulnesse, frightings, speaking in ye sleep, heauy dreams, the losse of all good colour, of naturall séed, vnfruitfulnesse, leprosie, and lastly, a madnes it self.
Item, the Palsy, Lithargie, the falling sicknes, and diuers such cold diseases. Is there not pro∣uoked through this drunkennesse a corruption of the stomacke? the parbraking of slimie and grosse humors? weakning of all the members? the gout? and to conclude, and vntimely death? so that it hath bene seene, that some in their drunkennesse haue remained dead. Who is it then that doth not take this drunkennes and swilling or gulling, for the most contagious, perillous, and sodainest sicknesse? Wherfore to helpe this extreame sicknesse, there is no certainer nor spée∣dier remedie, than Sobrietas, which is sobrietie, and fasting or abstinence; and albeit that this receit séeme to be altogether bitter, sowre and vnpleasant for these Ale knights, yet notwith∣standing it will expell the foresaid maladie, it sharpneth the vnderstanding and wits, it maketh a good stomacke, whereby good bloud is ingendred, & bringeth to the body none other but health. I conceale, that it strengtheneth the vitall spirits of al healthie bodies, causeth godlines to serue their Creator, to séek his glory in holinesse and righteousnesse, & to obey his commandements. Whereas then some haue so weak a stomack, that they of necessitie are constrained to drinke Wine: notwithstanding are so féeble of braine, that how soberly soeuer they drinke it, it distur∣beth their heads and maketh them drunken. For this purpose may these things following be vsed: to wit, iuice of Quinces, or raw Quinces well chewed, and the iuice taken downe: like∣wise the iuice of Citrons, and Limons, or of their sirupes, do hinder drunkennes: Hony is also much commended if it be taken after much drinking of wine; for thereby wil the vapors of the wine be so driuen downwards, that it cannot weaken the vnderstanding nor the braines. Bit∣ter Almonds confected, Conserues of Gilloflowers; after that you haue drunken much, do pre∣uent drunkennesse. In the old time men did make a Garland of Saffron flowers and did weare it on their heads; the same vertue is ascribed to the blew Violets. And it is said that white Cole∣woorts cut into Sallads and the same eaten, or the séeds therof chewed in the mouth shold hin∣der drunkennes: for the iuice of Colewoorts, or the pith of the stalkes doth stay the vapors of the wine from ascending into the head. The precious stone Amethist shold also preserue men from drunkennesse. But for to defend and preuent all contagions that procéed of drunkennes, we wil adde some things more. First, he must be vrged to vomit with Oxymel of Squils, with Radish seede, with a feather dipped in oyle and put into the throate, and thereupon he must fast and sléepe: and af∣ter he awaketh againe, you must froth his members, to wit, his hands and féete, with warme water wherein is sodden Roses, Cammomill, and a little salt, and tempered with some oyle of Violets, wherby the vapors may be drawne downwards. Item, lay a cloth vpon the head that is made wet with the iuice of Cucumbers, Purslaine, or in any of their waters: the patient must kéepe himself herein very sober, and vse light meats, Colewoorts, Lentils, young Pullets, and young Pigeons drest with the iuice of Limons, and Pomegranates: the prepared and confected Coriander is also very good, and sléeping thereup∣pon vntill that all the wine be digested, which may be séene by the concoction of the vrine. It chaunceth oftentimes that drunken folkes haue great thirst, which if it commeth not through the abundance of wine, then giue them faire fountaine water to drinke, and sower fruites to eate. You haue also an especiall thing in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, and fourth §. which is good for drunkennesse, and thirst after drunkennes. There is also a great difference in drunken∣nes, and that according to the nature of them that are drunken. He that is sanguine doth sing, daunce, laugh, and is merrie: he may be compared to children, that soone laugh, and for the most part know not why nor wherfore: and when as a long time they haue bene merrie, then begin they to sléepe till they haue slept it out. The cholericke man is in his drunkennesse angry, raging, clamorous, addicted to fighting, and will not be corrected nor admonished of any body, one cannot bring them to bed, they haue much babling, and are much bragging. The Phlegmatici, they will be wearie, lazie, sléepie, and kéepe themselues quiet. The Melancholici are sorrowfull, bewaile sometimes their sinnes, their friends disease, and that is the greatest imperfection of their drunkenes: they are therein like to the Apes, but in this they are all alike, that they stammer with their toung, they réele, and tarrie not by their right wits. How hurtfull also drunkennes is, doth appeare in many places of this our booke of Phisicke,
where we admonish all men to refraine it, and that not onely of this vnmeasurable drinking, whereof we now make mention, but also where all expert Phisitions do forbid wine. And we will for a conclusion adde this to the rest, that the Rape wine and Béere wine drunken after meate, doth make one more drunken and sléepie, than any other kind of Rhenish wine. And it is a common opinion that watered wine doth sooner insect the head, than pure wine. But this is to be vnderstood of grosse and thicke wine, which by the putting to of a little water is the more subtiller, whereby the vapour sooner fumeth into the head. You haue also many remedies before in the first part, the first Chapter, and eight §. that are commodious for the paine of the head through drunkennes. The 20. Chapter. Of Frighting and Feare. LEt no man wonder that we speake of Frighting amongst other sicknes∣ses: for it is not onely found by experience, that through many sorts of distemperature of the bloud many sundry sicknesses are prouoked, but al∣so a sudden death it selfe: whereof commeth not onely the aforementio∣ned, but also thereby is caused an inestimable feare and faintnes of art, whereby they become most vnfit for all worthy and knightly prowee, and are depriued of all counsell and indeuors. Of this faint hartednesse and feare, the Philosophers do write, that the same for the most part do raigne and dwell in the hart of such as are of a cold nature, which being sodainly and hastily set vpon, their subtillest bloud runneth with such a streame to the inward parts of the bodie, and towards the heart, that it séemeth, that the naturall heate shold be suffo∣cated; whereby cometh such bleaknes and quaking, yea somtimes swonnings, debilitie of the sinewes and muscles, that it makes frighted persons very féeble and weak, wherby also the mo∣tions of the muscles are so disturbed, that both ordure and vrine slides from them, their teeth chatter for cold, they are thirstie, and the whole bodie shiuering and shaking. For this are two principall and also certaine remedies (euen as Horatius saith) to wit, that one should build a wall of stéele about him, that is, shall alwaies haue an vpright conscience, that cannot accuse him of any misdealing. Secondly, that he feare God, and haue righteousnes alwaies before his eyes: which medicins do so frée men of all frighting, that (like as Dauid saith) it will alwaies go well with him: and know for certaine, that God of his goodnesse hath with his holy Angels (as it were a strong towre) compassed him round about, wherby he will defend him. But the faintnes of heart is also to be holpen with naturall medicines. Note therefore, that when the bloud through frighting is stirred, and runneth towards the heart (as it indeed hap∣neth) then must of necessitie the trembling and quaking follow after it: for which you haue in the second part, the sixt Chapter, and seuenth §. a very good Elderne water & many other things described. When a woman (with child especially) is frighted, then do some bid, that there should be taken a quarter of an ounce of clarified hony, and therewith some scraped Nutmegge, and so eate it all together. Wine moderatly drunken, maketh the fearfull and faint-harted men, stout and couragious. And it is a common custome, if any be sore frighted, that he be admonished to make water, and if there be any that after such frighting can come hardly to himselfe, and fell into a swoune, then is he to vse those things that strengthen the hart, for which there are many remedies des∣cribed in the second part, the sixt Chapter, and first §. and also afterwards in the description of the heart.
The 21. Chapter. Of Trembling. FOrasmuch as the trembling or quaking is a signe or token of feare, (yea for the most part is caused thereby) therefore it might be néedfull to write somewhat amply therof: But we haue made in the first Part, the twelfth Chapter, and twelfth §. a long discourse thereof, and therwith also shew∣ed, that this is a disease of the Braines. Also of the trembling and panting of the heart, hath bene spoken at large in the second part, the sixt Chapter, from the third §. vnto the sixt §. Wherefore I do suppose, that it were néedlesse to discourse any further thereof at this present. The 22. Chapter. Of the impediments that come of Fals. INto what diseases men may fall, by fals, stumblings, blowes, pinches, and such like, is sufficiently knowne to all men: whereof we haue also written in diuers places, and especially in the second part, the fift Chap∣ter, of the vomiting of bloud: and also in the eightéenth §. of the clotted bloud, where very good remedies are described, and therefore here are but a few declared. But if any be brused much through a fall, then haue the Chirurgians a speciall experiment, that they spéedily fley off the skin of a Weather, the which they must lay warme round about the brused or wrenched member, and kéepe it warme, and this should helpe in one day. Brimstone sodden in strong wine, is also very good: In like manner powned Garlicke tem∣pered with Barrowes grease. Item, take Bran of Rie meale, the rootes of Ebulus, of each a like quantitie, séeth them toge∣ther in a little Vineger, and so bind it vpon the wrenched or brused part. There was once a child fallen out of his Cradle, who therby had got a swelling on his arme; which was healed by annointing it with oyle and salue of Roses. For this also do serue all golden and waters of life, principally if any swouning were at hand, the same waters drunken and laid vpon the brused member, and annointed doth heale. And if the dead Palsey or falling sicknesse ioyne with it, then look into the first part, the twelfth Chapter, in the end of the thirteenth §. where are shewed some good remedies commodious for this purpose. And if the ioynts be remoued from their naturall places, then reade the description of the Crookebacke, in the second part, the fourth Chapter, and second §. In like manner also of the dislocation in the fourth part, the seuenth Chapter, and first §. where very good remedies are described. The end of the sixt Part.
The seuenth Part of this Booke speaketh of certaine Poy∣sons, and Venims, of Plants, Mettals, and Beasts. THe miserable life of man is not subiect to sicknesses and diseases e∣nough, as well inwardly as outwardly, but there must be diuers ve∣nimous things to hurt and annoy the same, which are almost among all creatures, and with such hurtfull qualitie indued, that they be∣reaue men of their liues, some sooner, and some later. But God of his goodnesse hath ordained innumerable and wholesome meanes for it, and that almost in the smallest creatures, as in Herbs, Roots, Earths, and other: amongst which the simplest in sight haue otherwhiles the most vertue to resist the strongest poyson; preseruing both man and beast from death, euen as hereafter may be séene in many places, which ought to admonish vs to praise and thanke God almightie for our health, and to ac∣knowledge him to be the fountaine of all goodnesse. And to speake and treate thereof in this our Booke of phisicke we purpose to rehearse them in this seuenth Part, wherein shall be onely ad∣monished of such poysons as are knowne in Germanie, and (as one may speake) are euery day before our eyes. For what poysons are or may be found in the East, and in Aphrica, it were su∣perfluous to speake of them at this present. We will part these poysons or venims into thrée kinds: whereof the first shall be the vegetables, as Herbes, Rootes, Plants, Séeds, Iuices, and such like: the second sort are the venimous Mettals: the third sort are certaine Beasts, & what∣soeuer else commeth from them, whereby men are harmed: so that the summe of this seuenth Part consisteth in two things. First, to know all the venims wherby héede may be taken to es∣chew them. Secondly, if it so chance that any one haue taken any of them vnwittingly, or were ministred vnto him by another; how that one may helpe him, and shew how that venime might be withstood, and how to extinguish his deadly qualitie. For it is very néedfull that euery Phi∣sition or housholder be prouided with good remedies against all manner of venime, whereby he as soone as néede requireth, may haue somewhat in readinesse that he may minister against the venime so taken. For in all such causes there serueth no delay; as there be but a few venimous beasts and other, which if they be not remedied out of hand, do so infect, that afterwards they remaine irremediable, as we haue also shewed in other places. And therefore must we match and méete with these venimous and hurtfull things, imita∣ting the first rule, if any man be poysoned by meate or drinke, then is a vomit the principallest remedie. Or if he haue receiued any venime through thrusts or biting, then must you set cups or boxes with pricking theron, scarifying or cauterizing the sound flesh about the wounds, and at the last if néed be cut off the whole ioynt or member. And those thrusts and bits are to be cured by some iniection and application, so to hinder the violence and operation of the poyson. The poyson taken inwardly is subdued through tart and sharpe wine, and other meanes: and lastly through purging, sweating, and such like, as hereafter shall be taught. Regard is also to be had of the qualitie of the venime, and of the strength of them that haue taken it; that the stron∣gest poysons may be expelled with the strongest remedies: and the smallest venimes with mild medicines and remedies. Also regard must be had to the time of the yeare, and to the age of the poysoned person. This is now briefly prefixed for a Preface, we will now procéed to the reme∣dies.
The first Chapter. All those things that are good against Poyson. ALl that by the learned may be vsed against poyson, shall here be de∣scribed and specified; and we will shew and name those things that are well knowne, and easily gotten. For what may it profite vs to counsell any man to take the gall of an Elephant, the bloud of a Crocodile, and the Egs of a Tortoyse in the sea? First, Veriuice (which is of himselfe good alone) or a sirupe made thereof, is very good, for it withstandeth al Poyson. The rootes of Valerian, browne Betonie, and Rue, of each a dragme, taken with wine, is also good against poyson. Conserues of Gilloflowers and their wine are also good for the same: the Beuercod, the conserues and wine of Burrage do also withstand poy∣on. In like manner also the iuice and the sirupe of Citrons, and all that is made thereof. Carduus Benedictus leaues are also maruellous good against all venime (it is said that Frede∣ricke the Emperor was the first that brought the same herbe out of Gréece into Germanie) for the iuice, water, powder, and séed of it are all good against poyson. Fennell seede is also much commended, Sealed earth (if it be right) is of all Phisitions ac∣compted for a noble medicine against all venime. Peucedanus and wild Radish are also much commended. Wine of Harts toung is also vsed for the same, albeit the auncient Phisitions do make no mention thereof. The Conserues of Elderne flowers is also very good, and is accounted a conserue for the common people. The Conserues of Hyssope, and the wine of the same, doth also contend with venime. Nep, Comin, and Caraway, are more strong than the Fennell séede. Agaricus is good if a man will purge. Angelica is of all Phisitions accounted good against all manner of venim, and recommended by the name Laserpitium. Eringus withstandeth all venim. The Oleander which the Gréekes call Nerion and Rhododen∣dron is also commended. The long Hartwoort is also good. Rue hath an especiall efficacie a∣gainst all poyson: and in like manner the séedes of wild Rue; Rosemarie is also praised of some: the learned write not any thing thereof. Sagapenum and Serapinum is also accounted good for it. Wormwood, and all that is made of Wormwood is maruellous good against all venime. The compounded things that are commodious against all venime, shall hereafter follow. An exhortation for all those that are afraid to be poysoned. §. 2. AVncient Phisitions were woont to haue an old Prouerbe, and to say, that Ve∣nime is so proud that it dwelleth commonly in Gold and Siluer: whereby they meant, that great personages that eate and drinke out of gold and siluer, are in greater danger to be poysoned, than the common people that do eate and drinke out of earthen dishes; wherefore must such high personages that are a∣fraid to be poysoned, diligently take héede of the meate and drinke that they eate, and that are drest of diuers things. Also they must not take too much of all swéet, salt, and sower drinkes; and they must not eate too eagerly nor too hastily, and they must at all times haue great regard of the first tast of their meate and drinke. But the most surest way is, that before the mealetide he take somewhat that may resist ve∣nim, as Figs, Rue, or Nuts: each by himselfe or tempered together. The Citrons, Rape séede,
Nepe or any of those that are described before, the waight of a dragme taken with wine, now one and then another, is very much commended. Sometimes also two Figs with a little Salt, then againe Mithridate or Treacle, and such like mo may he vse before the mealetide. When any bodie perceiueth that he hath taken Poyson. §. 3. BVt if one be sure and perceiue, or certainely know that he hath taken poyson, then must there be no long disputing what is to be done: for in case ye one will be long a counselling what shall be done, then wil the venim in the mean time infect his bloud and other vital parts: wherby the partie may be neglected, and afterwards also remaine incurable. Therefore must the common meanes be vsed (as is said before) to prouoke him to vomite & cast, and that through the taking of luke warme water tempered with Sallad oyle or with swéet Butter. There are here and there in this booke diuers remedies expressed, whereby vomiting is to be furthered, which may be vsed for this purpose, and you may séeke for them in the Table. And as soone as the patient hath vomited, then are you to cause him to haue a loose and open bodie, which may soone be brought to passe with a strong Clister, whreby the remaining sharp∣nes of the venim, that might remaine behind in the stomack, or in the bowels, might be driuen out and expelled. The signes when one is poysoned. §. 4. ALbeit that the signes of those that be poysoned, and the nature of the Poyson taken, or the biting of a venimous beast are diuers (as shall hereafter be more at large declared:) neuerthelesse can it not be but good and requisite to compre∣hend them all vnder one. First they get a vehement paine in the stomacke, in the belly, and in the bowels, paine of the Liuer, the kidneys, and the bladder. Often they get a hoarsnesse, gnawing and biting, shiuering, cold, dumbnesse, and conuulsion of the sinewes, féeblenesse of the pulse, the Lethargie, swimming of the head, darknesse of sight, and a shortnesse of breath, yea that they seeme to choke, great thirst, bléeding, lacke of appetite, great heat, great féeblenesse of the face, losse of vnderstanding, of might, and mo such like symptomes; yet hereby cannot sufficiently be known the nature of the poyson that hath bene taken. For example, if any man hath taken Cantharides (which are Spanish Flies) he getteth diseases in the toung, in the stomacke, and in the kidneys, the bladder is inflamed, he can scarcely make water, to wit, without infinite paine, bloud, and great sharpnesse. The Ca∣terpillars of the Firre trée called Buprestes, and the Salamandra, do also cause ye foresaid accidents. Item, all those that haue taken Opium do fall into a very déepe sléepe, or altogether into a maladie, that is called Lethargus, to wit, the sléepie sicknesse, they get bleake spots, they waxe sluggish, cold and stiffe, and are depriued of all their senses. The like chanceth to them that haue taken the iuice of Mandragora, or the iuice of Hemlocke. The Henbane séed maketh men not only foolish and raging, but as it were mad, or as if they had taken Aconitum: they be not onely choked that haue taken Aconitum, but also those that do take Toadstooles, Ceruse, Gippes, and Oxe bloud: but (as it is said) we shall hereafter further discourse and admonish at large of this matter. Here we will most of all intreat of those poysons especially that grow, and whatsoeuer else procéedeth thereof, and adde vnto them their Latine and Greeke names.
The second Chapter. Of the venimous Plants and such like. THe Mandragora is not otherwise called in Latin nor in Gréeke, and is by good reason placed amongst the venims, for that by her nature which is cold in the third degrée, it doth choke one: and when one taketh too much of the iuice, then causeth it a sleepe vnto death. It is also very drie, yet may with discretion the waight of one dragme be giuen thereof as néede requireth: for the learned write, that if any man be too sore frighted or feared, so that he must be cut or burnt, then must there be giuen one drag. of this roote vnto him, and he shall then fall into so déepe a sleepe, that he shall thrée or foure howers long remaine vnsensible, in which space the Chirurgian haue time enough to do their worke. But what the Toothdrawers or Mountibankes do with this roote of Mandragora, (making the people beléeue that they grow vnder the gallowes of the vrine of the hanged theeues, ha∣uing the forme of a man) is knowne to all men. Henbane is called of the Greekes Hyoscyamus, and at the Apothecaries Iusquiamus, which is almost as much to say, as hogs beans, and that by reason that this herbe is a deadly poyson for swine, if they be not presently well washed, and drinke much, or do eate Creuets, which haue a speciall operation against this poyson. This Henbane is of three kinds: the one hath red flowers and blacke seede: the second hath yellow flowers and yellow seedes, and are both by their very cold nature venimous: the third hath white flowers and white seeds, and is also cold to the third degree, which of the Phisitions is very aptly vsed in some causes: but if you cannot get the white, then take the yellow, and leaue the blacke. You may make of the new seede a iuice, which is dried in the sun, but it may not be kept aboue one yeare. When you haue taken this iuice, then will it make one franticke, and as he were drunken, but by certaine medicines the same wil quickly away. You must take therefore the milke of an Asse, or in stead thereof Goats milk or Cowes milke. Item, Hony water is very good for it, if he drinke much thereof: when you are weary therof then cease and then drinke againe afresh. Water wherein Figs were sodden, is also very good for his. Cucumber seedes or Pingles sodden in wine and so vsed, are good for this purpose. I∣tem, wine that is somewhat salted, and tempered with Barrowes grease, is also not ill. Item, there is very commodious for it Nettle seede, Cicorie rootes, white Mustard seede, Cresses, Radishes, Onions, or Garlicke, any one of these taken with wine, and then after∣wards the patient laid to sleepe, euen as one that is drunken. Coriander is a knowne seede, called in Latin Coriandrum, and in Gréeke Corion, or Corianon. The learned haue diuers opinions of it, Dioscorides writeth, that it is cold, but Galenus and his followers do reiect this opinion, and saith, that it is hote, or at least somewhat warming. And albeit this seede be somewhat venimous, yet may the same easily be corrected, to wit, when it hath bene stéeped in Vineger, and is dried againe, and then may it be vsed in many medicins as you may find euery where, &c. Take prepared Coriander &c. The nature of his venime is, that when one eateth too much of this séede, or drinketh too much of the iuice, then will the head be thereby so out of frame, as if a man were drunke: it maketh one hoarse, and as if he were dumb, or if he speake, yet are they but vnreuerent words. In fine, it is not without great dan∣ger: for it hath bene often found, that after the taking of the iuice death hath followed, there∣fore it is good counsell, that you vse of this a little, and but seldome: yea some will correct the Phisitions that daily vse this seede for strengthening of the head, by reason that it is much con∣trarie to the head, and noysome. Now to take away the venim of this séede, you are first to cause the patient to vomit, and that with oyle called Irinum, or in stead thereof, with oyle of Oliues, both of them taken with the warme decoction of Wormwood. Also you may fry an Eg or two in this oyle, and mixe it with pickle of salt fish, and so drinke it, or the pickle alone, well salted
Hen-broth or Goose-broth. In like sort sodden wine mingled with ley, are very good for it. Nardus seeds or Nigella séeds, called in Gréeke Melanthion, and in latin Nigella, by reason of his blacknesse. There are foure kinds of it, two blacke, the which (by reason of their pleasant smell) are planted in the gardens: another which groweth of himselfe in the fields: the fourth sort is yellowish, and hath no difference from the black kinds. The nature of them all is hot and drie, which maketh them venemous, when one taketh too much thereof he is in danger of death. And herein is a wondrous work of nature, that contrariwise it resisteth poison, and in old time (by reason of his pleasantnesse) was baked in bread. For what diseases then this seed is good, that is shewed and taught in moe other places. Milke thistle. This roote the Gréekes cal Chamaeleonta, for that the leaues do alter their colour after diuers sorts, according to the nature of the ground, now black, and then greene, now blew, and then yellow, and into diuers other colours: In latine this herbe is called Carduus Suarius, that is, Sowthistle, for that it killeth hogs if they eate this herbe mingled with Barley meale. In like maner it killeth Rats and Mice if they eate therof and drink not thereafter immediatly. The Apothecaries call this herbe Cardopatium. Because that this is hurtfull to the said beasts, therefore cannot it be but hurtfull to men if they eate too much thereof. And the same is mani∣fested by his nature, for that it is hot in the second degrée, and drie in the third: yet this roote is often vsed for many things, and highly commended, and that most of all against the venome of the Plague. There are two sorts, blacke and white Milkethistle, both of one nature: notwith∣standing there is here to be noted, that the blacke is to be vsed onely outwardly. The Yewtrée do the Greekes call Smilax, and the Latinists Taxus. This tree is well knowne, he groweth prosperously in cold and shadowie places, for such is his nature. That he is placed amongst the venims, is not without cause: for it hath bene tried, that if bottels be made of it, and the wine kept therein a certaine time, it killeth a man. In like maner doth the fruite of the same tree which groweth in Spaine. Moreouer it is said, that whosoeuer sléepeth vnder the shadow of this trée, or vpon the leaues, and specially vpon his blossomes, must die, for that the whole body will be thereby ouercooled, that a man must die sodainly. His leaues are not hurt∣full for the wild beasts, but onely for such beasts as do not chew their cud, as the swine, Horses, Asses, &c. they are killed with it. It is said also, that if a copper naile be strooke into his stem or body, then will his venome vanish away. His smoake should kill Mice. And his venome will also be taken away by the same meanes that hereafter is prescribed against the venom of Hem∣locke, where you may séeke and finde the same. Wild Cucumbers and their iuice Elaterium, whereof is so many times admonished that men must deale with it warily, and vse but a very little at one time, except it be in grieuous sicknes∣ses, as the Dropsie, and such like: the Gréekes do call this herbe Sicyagrion, which is wilde Cu∣cumbers, for that the same are like to the tame Cucumbers. When these wilde Cucumbers are ripe, and softly handled or wroong, then breake they open, wherfore you must looke to your eies, for they are hurtfull. In Latine it is called Cucumis Anguinus, Syluestris and Erraticus. The Apo∣pothecaries and common people call it a wilde Cucumber. His iuice is Elaterium: it is made as well of the rootes as of the leaues: but it is not so forcible as that which is made of the fruite. Of all medicines, there is none that continueth longer good than the same, for Theophrastus wri∣teth, that it hath bene found good and forcible 200. yeares, & it ought not be vsed vntill it be three yeares old: it is hot and dry by nature, for which cause Dioscorides doth place it amongst poisons. It is so vehement, that when a woman vseth it in pessaries it killeth the fruite. But we haue written of it also in the Introduction. Fleawort. The Gréekes do cal the séed of this herb Psyllium, the Latinists Pulicariam, by reason that the séed is like to Fleas, or that it hindereth the bréeding of such vermin: The Apothecaries do kéepe both the Latin & Greeke names. It is (as some say) cold in the second degrée, & is measu∣rably drie and moist. Others do ascribe great cold vnto it, wherewith this following doth agree. Albeit this séed be commodiously vsed, as many places of this booke may witnesse, yet hath it ne∣uertheles his venom, to wit, when one vseth too much therof, for that it maketh the whole body cold, sluggish, féeble and vnapt. Against this may be vsed that which is prescribed for Coriander. Crowfoote, the Gréekes do call Batrachion, the Latinists Ranunculum, that is Frogwort, either because it willingly groweth (as Frogs do) in moist places, or for that the Frogs gladly hide themselues vnder it. Some call this herbe Flammulam, by reason of his burning nature;
for being applied gréene, it doth not onely excoriate the place with paine, but also if the flowers lie long thereon, it maketh a hard escarre: The beggars haue learned this so wel, that therwith they open their legs, and make them sore, that they are lothsome to behold, to the end that there∣by they may get the greater almes. As much as appertaineth to the venome of this herbe, it is by nature hot and drie, so that it burneth not only the outward parts, but also the inward parts, when it is taken inward. The roote dried prouoketh néesing: if one hold it a good while at a tooth, it drieth so much that it falleth to peeces. Apistrum, which the Apothecaries do call Apium risus, is also of the same nature. We call it water Crowfoote: it is with vs very sharpe, but much sharper and more venemous in the Iland Sardinia. Al that eate therof are depriued of their vnderstanding, the sinewes of their mouth and lips are so mightily conuulsed that the patient séemeth alwayes to laugh, when neuertheles he dieth: whereof that vulgar prouerbe is sproong, Sardinius risus, which is, Sardinians laughing, that is as much as when one laugheth where he had more néede to wéepe. Now to cure this venome, you are to giue to the harmed abundance of hony water and milk to drinke, and annoint the body with some warming salue, or to put the patient into a bath of warme water, among which oyle is tempered; and in fine to vse all things for this purpose that is to be vsed for the crampe and conuulsion of the sinewes. Nightshade do the Greekes call Strichinos or Trichnos, and the Latinists Solanum, the which name the Apothecaries haue turned into Solatrum. Hereof are foure kinds described by the lear∣ned, whereof the first is garden Nightshade, which may be eaten amongst other pot herbs. The second sort are the winter Cherries, whereof we will not write any thing. The third sort pro∣uoketh sléepe. The fourth sort maketh men mad and out of their wits, wherefore it is called in low Dutch, Dulcryut, that is, Maddingwort. The Nightshade that prouoketh sléepe, is colde in the third degree, like to Opium, whereof we will speake shortly, but it is not altogether so colde: and albeit that sometimes the root of this herb is taken for the dropsie, yet notwithstanding shal the same be forborne; for it hath often hapned, that when one hath taken too many of the berries that he thereby is become raging and mad, yea so stiffe ouer al his body, as though al his ioynts were dislocated. This stifnesse accustometh commonly to endure thrée dayes, so that some decei∣uers accustome to vse the same to bring men into a misbeléefe, as Plinie writeth. If one take the waight of a dragme of this roote, it maketh a man lusty, friendly, and causeth wonderful fan∣tasies, so that they séeme to be foolish, and to haue forgot all shamefastnes. And such as take two dragmes thereof, they wil be wholy mad & raging: and if one take half an ounce, then wil death follow; for the said Pliny writeth, that the Gréeks with such like meriments haue plaid the fooles: whereby may easily be noted, that these two species of Nightshade ought not to be vsed for any medicine inwardly. And this foresaid making mad is none other than that the Gréekes cal Do∣ryonion, which was vsed in old time for the poisoning of arrowes. The taste of this herbe is like milke, it prouoketh hoarsnesse, it hurteth the toong by his moisture, it expelleth blood by vomit, driueth out matter and filth by stoole, euen as they that haue the red or bloody flixe. Thus before those and such like accidents do appeare, you may vse these remedies following, to wit, that the patient take much Hony water, wherein Violets are sodden, and then vomit it out againe. In like maner are you to vse the milke of an Asse, Goates milke, or new warme wine, wherein An∣nis seed is tempered, or wherewith bitter Almonds are mingled. The water wherein Mussels, Crabs, and such like are sodden, is very commodious to be drunken for it, yea Mussels them∣selues eaten raw, and likewise clisters: and in fine, al that may draw the venom out of the body. Nesingwort is of two sorts, to wit, white and blacke Néeseworts: the Gréekes call it Ellebo∣rus, and the Latinists veratrum nigrum, whereof we haue at large discoursed in the Introduction. We take this herbes name of the operation, because it vrgeth néesing. The auncient Phisitions make much a do with it, and committed many follies by it. Both these rootes are in vse, yet it is with them as with other things, that whosoeuer taketh thereof too much it is poison, and brin∣geth him into the perill of death. These rootes are hereby knowne to be venemous, when as they are digged vp, & that the va∣por of them riseth into the face of the digger, that thereby he hath great paine in the head, & swel∣leth much: wherefore it must be digged vp spéedily, and the digger ought to stand with his back to the wind, & to eate some Garlick before, and then drinke a good draught of wine after it. Black Néesingwort killeth horses, oxen, and swine, and purgeth downewards. White Néesingwort is
not so hurtfull for cattell, and purgeth vpwards. The phisitions specially forbid that none of these rootes shal be vsed in women, old folkes, nor children, nor in them that haue a short breath. Poppie heads, and the iuice of them, called Opium, the which is knowne with vs very well, is called of the Gréekes Mecon, and of the Latinists Papauer. Some of them haue red flowers, which are Corneroses, the which if one plant, they beare white, gray, and blacke séeds, of which the white are the best, and the blacke the worst. All their natures are cold vntill the fourth de∣grée, therefore not onely the séed, but also the whole herbe prouoketh sleepe. There is also a yel∣low sort, but the same is hot and drie by nature. And by reason of the extreame cold, is this herb numbered amongst venomes, not (if it be measurably vsed) that it bringeth any hurt with it, for that the séed thereof is baked in bread, but onely when one taketh too much thereof, and that chiefly of the blacke, which is much stronger than the white, in prouoking sleepe, for thereby is the sleepie sicknesse Lethargus caused. And of this blacke Poppie seed, or of these heads (the which grow not in this countrey, but elsewhere) is the iuice made, dried, and afterwards is called O∣pium, which is vsed in many places of this booke. But if you are to vse it inwardly, then must it (as we haue often admonished) be warily taken in hand: for if there be too much thereof giuen at once, then doth it cause a man to sléepe so long till he die: Therefore there are a number of auncient phisitions that affirme that none ought to be vsed little or much of it, to wit, inwardly; but to leaue and refuse it as a very hurtful poison. But if it happen that any haue taken thereof too much, then are you to giue vnto him salt with Oxymel to drinke, euen as is to be done when any body is poisoned with Toadstooles. Toadstooles, do the Gréekes call Mycites, the Latinists Fungi: whereof are many kindes, and some when they are drest cannot hurt, yet at all times giue no good nourishment, for that they are hard of digestion, and are auoided downewards, as they were taken. In fine, all learned men agrée in this point, that some through a secret nature, and other through their quantitie, do kill one no otherwise than as if they were strangled with a cord or rope. Wherefore it is rather a brauery, and an intolerable lickerishnesse of them that eate the same, and put their health in danger, than any part of wisedome. Do not we reade of the Emperor Claudius, & of whole families, that méeting together at ban∣kets, and eating of the Toadstooles, haue died instantly? We speake not here of those that eate the same moderatly, and onely for pleasure, and yet that they do no great good to those that vse them: for they augment the cholericke humors, and inflame all other bad humors of the body. One may know them hereby, that in dressing they waxe hard: they also got a venemous nature if they grow about rustie iron, or any foule thing. Item, by any venemous beasts, as Adders, Snakes, Toades, and such like, when they haue their holes thereabout, and so infect the same. Wherefore it is to be well noted, that when any haue taken thereof, and find any hinderance of the breath, or otherwise finde himselfe ill at ease, that then the patient must immediatly be caused to vomit, whereby the poison may be cast vp; which may be done by the taking of the pic∣kle of fish and ley mingled together, or by the decoction of Marierom and Hyssope. The force of this venome may also be allayed by Hens dung taken with veneger. Esula, all the venemous herbes that giue milke, are seuen in number, described by the ancient phisitions, and all of them are called of the Gréeks by one name, Tithymalon, and of the Latinists Herbae lactariae, as milke herbes, the Apothecaries call it Esula: of these herbes there are some spe∣cies vnknowne, wherefore we wil not waste much time in describing them: al together (yet the one more than the other) are hote in the fourth degree, and drie aboue measure; so that if one breake a sprig thereof, and holdeth the same to his toong the space of many houres, he cannot be rid of the burning. Also if you lay the powned herbe on the whole skin, then beginneth the same forthwith to inflame and burne, so that it séemeth that a cole of fire lieth thereon. In like manner also doth this roote manifest his venome first in the digging vp, whereby the digger and also the preparer are to expect more danger than hath bin told of Néesingwort, and by reason of her great venom, is this root but seldome vsed by famous phisitions for the purging of superfluous Cholera and Melancholia, euen as you may sée in some places of this booke: but how a man shall prepare this roote, that haue you before in the Introduction. The herbe Wolfsbane, and specially the roote, is of the ancient phisitions and Poets accoun∣ted the most venemous plant; so that when they will once talke of poison, they call it Aconiton, with which name the Gréekes and the Latinists call Wolfsbane, which is of two sorts, wherof
the one is called Pardalianches, for that it choketh the Panthers, and hath a roote, that at the end is like the tayle of a Scorpion, which is called of the Apothecaries vua versa or Lupina. The other sort is called of the Gréekes Lycoctonon, which is Wolfsbane, for that specially more than any other beasts it straightway strangleth the Wollfe, notwithstanding that it also killeth the Foxes, Swine, and all other wild beasts, if the powder of this roote be strewed vpon any thing that they come to eate. In fine, of all venomes there is none that sooner killeth and taketh out of the world, and that not onely when one taketh it inwardly, but also if one touch it: For if one touch any she cattell therewith about their members, then must they die the same day. His nature is to corrode continualy inward, and maketh the parts that it toucheth stinking. Both of these sorts grow much in Germanie in the vallies and on high hils. And verily there is ano∣ther wonder of nature with it, to wit, that this venome most mightily withstandeth all other venomes: As for example, when one taketh this Wolfesbane or Monkeshood, then must he ex∣pect none other than present death, vnlesse there be another poison before in the same body, as if one were stung before by a Scorpion. Wolfesbane finding another poison in a mans bodie, opposeth it selfe against it after a most vehement maner, and expelleth it, yea and combateth against it no otherwise but as a warrior that omitteth all other things, and setteth onely vpon his enemie, in which strife they remaine both slaine, and the man retaineth his life. As soone as one hath receiued this poison of Wolfes bane, there commeth a swimming vpon him; chiefly if he would arise his eyes will runne, he féeleth great anguish in the breast, and in all inward parts: his breath will be short and grie∣uous, therefore it is néedfull that you endeuour to expell this poyson by vomits and Clisters. First, there is good for it sodden Marierom, Rue, Horehound, Wormewood, and Wormewood wine, Housleeke, Southernewood, Milke thistle, wilde Cypresse, and moe such like. In like manner also the right Balsame, if you giue it with the waight of one dragme with hony, or with milke, Beuercod, pepper, and Rue, of each one scruple, may be taken with wine for this purpose. Also the rennet of a yong Kid, of a yong hare, or yong Roebucke drunken with vineger, is also very good. The wine wherein a péece of glowing gold, a péece of siluer, or a glowing iron is quenched, is also highly commended for it. Or ley and wine, wherein a henne is sodden. Fresh broth made with Béefe, mingled with wine and drunken. The herbe of wild Cipresse is also very re∣quisite for it. Hemlocke is well knowne euery where, and is called of the Gréekes Conion, of the Latinists and Apothecaries Cicuta, but by vs it is called Hemlocke. It killeth men, and that very extreme∣ly, if any one take of his iuice. It is a very cold herbe, and therefore very venemous. With this herbe haue the Athenians gotten the name of Tyrants, for that therewith amongst many o∣ther they murthered Socrates. Against this poison it is very good that one do drinke much strong wine, and that betimes, before the poison passeth to the parts of life. It is also taken to be certaine and sure, that if his iuice be tempered with wine and drunke, that there is no counsell nor helpe to be expected against it. Outwardly the Hemlocke is to be vsed in some accidents with aduantage, as hath bene she∣wed in diuers places of this booke. All they that receiue of this poison, their head seemeth to run round, and their sight so darke∣ned, that at last they can sée no more, they waxe hoarse, they lose their vnderstanding, the out∣ward parts waxe cold, and are conuulsed as if they had the Crampe, the pulse will be still, the breath tarieth behind, and they die miserably. Wherefore (as in all other venoms) the patient is straightway to be made to cast and vomit, to minister Clisters, and continually plie him with wine, giuing him Asses milke, Cow milke, Wormewood, and pepper, tempered with wine and Rue. Item, iuice of Mints tempered with wine, is here much commended. In like manner also Ameos, Cardamome, or Storax, the waight of halfe an ounce, Pepper with Nettle séede, and Bayberries drunke with wine. Item, Vine euict excessiuely drunken, and vomited vp againe, is against this sort of poison much commended. Dogs bane is called of the Gréekes Ephemeron, for that it killeth a man in one day. And that we may make difference of this roote from such as are not venemous, namely from the Liri∣confansie,
we will adde Colchion with it, by reason of the countrey where it groweth in great abundance, and most venemous: the Latinists call the same Bulbum agrestem, and the Apothe∣caries Hermodactylum. They grow almost in all medowes in Germanie, and are swéete in the mouth, whereby the ignorant (by reason of their pleasant tast) may be easily deceiued, and al∣lured to eate thereof, whereby they are in danger of death: for as soone as they come into the sto∣mack, by and by they féele a burning & a paine ouer all the whole body, as if they had bin burnt with Nettles, they féele also a gnawing in the bowels, the stomacke will be hot and oppressed, and in time there commeth a laske after it, so that the scrapings of the bowels and bloud doth follow, and lastly death it selfe. For this are all remedies good that are prescribed against the venom of toadstooles, to wit, vomiting and clisters. It is good before the venome get the mastery to drinke water wherein is sodden Oken buds, Acornes, Pomegranate péeles, or wild Thime, and is mingled with milke. Item, you may also vse one of these iuices following, as the iuice of Cicorie, of Blackberry leafe, of Mirtles tempered with wine, the inward péeles of Chestnuts powdered and mingled amongst it is also very good. In like maner it is especiall good to drinke Marierom with Lie. And aboue all things, there is nothing better than Cow milke, or the milk of a Buffell drunken in great abundance, and held in the mouth: for if one haue such milke, it is no counsell to séeke any further for any other things. The third Chapter. Of the venemous Mettals, and such like. AS we haue spoken in the description of the foresaid venemous plants on∣ly of such as are well knowne in this countrey, so we will here treate of certaine mettals, and of all that commeth thereof, and teach also thereby when any body is poisoned therewith, how that venome is to be resisted. Ceruse, the Latinists call it Cerussam, and is taught by Dioscorides that the same is made of lead by the vapor of the vineger. This art was found long ago, but now at this time it is made more easie. The Ceruse taken inwardly, is deadly. Through the taking in of Ceruse foloweth hoarsnes, cough, drouth of the tongue, coldnesse in the outward parts, losse of vnderstanding, and the members will be thereby weary, sluggish, and féebled. These accidents are to be holpen by these meanes following, as with hony water, with sodden Violets, or Mallowes water, with warme milke, with beaten séed of Sesamum sodden in wine, with Lie that is made of Vine ashes, with oyle of Marierom, or with Oleo Irino, or with water wherin Peach kernels are sodden, Pigeons egges with Frankinsense, sodden Barley and Prunes: you may giue any of these things which you wil, and as often as you will, and cast them out againe. In like maner there is good for this Scammonea sodden with Hony water. Gips is very like vnto Chalke, for it is made of many stones by calcination, and also digged out of the earth. His nature is, that when it is made soft with water, it is immediatly altered a∣gaine into a hard stone: the same doth it also in the body of man, whereby it strangleth presently: wherefore all that is prescribed against the venome of the toadstooles, is also good for this. Item, oile that is sodden with Mallowes in stead of water, by reason that it is fat, prouoketh a slip∣pery passage for vomiting, and hindereth also the exulceration of the passages. Likewise there is also good the oile of hony water, or drie figs sodden therein and so drunken. The lie which is made with the ashes of the Fig trée is maruellous good for it: or in the place therof you may take the ashes of Oken wood, and eate Figs. Also you may vse the ashes of the Vine, and temper the same with wine, and drinke much thereof, and then cast it or vomit it out againe. Lime and Gips are very like one to another, and they match one another with their venome. The red myne, whereby some do vnderstand the red lead, and some sinople, or mine of the quick∣siluer, Sandaraca, Auripigmentum, which is Orpiment, they are for the most part al of one nature, that they torment the intrailes with an intolerable paine; and in case that there be no remedy had for the same in time, then doth it kill him. We will also adde to the former the yellow, red, and white Ratsbane or Arsenicum. For this is commodious all that expelleth venome, abateth his sharpnesse, and looketh the belly, whereof there is much written before. The iuice of Holli∣hockes and of Mallowes is speciall good for it, by reason that they are both of them mollifying.
For this also you are to giue him a potion wherein Linséed and Rice are sodden, or Milke tem∣pered with Hony water must he drinke vnmeasurably. In like maner also all fat flesh broth. Quicksiluer is called in Gréeke Hydrargyron, which is Water siluer, and in Latine Argentum viuum: we call it in this country Quicksiluer, and is of Plinie called a venome excéeding all other venomes. It doth also manifest the same in mans bodie, not onely taken inwardly, but also an∣nointed ouer the outside. That it is such a poison not only of the blood, but also of the venemous pocks, and of other maladies moe, as you may see and reade before in diuers places of this booke. Some do say, if one drinke it, it presently runneth though the body: but if any such thing happen, yet notwithstanding there remaineth somewhat thereof behind in the body that doth hurt the same and the intrailes. For the remedie of this poison, one must drinke much milk, and then vo∣mit it vp againe: or in stéed thereof Wormwood wine, or water wherein Smallage, the seeds of Clary, and Marierom, or Isop are sodden. For this is also very requisite small filed gold, which doth draw the Quicksiluer vnto it in a wonderful maner, as by experience may daily be séene at the goldsmiths and other, how quickly it cleaueth to the gold, and when it is warme, it mingleth it selfe with the gold, where neuertheles al other things that are cast vpon it are expelled from it, and swim on the top of it, and letteth them not fall to the bottome. There may also be well vsed against the venom of Quicksiluer al that standeth written against the litharge of gold. Further, it is wel knowne to all the world that there is no stronger venom than the Mercurius sublimatus, like as all Chirurgians and Pockmasters do find by experience, when as they do vse the same in any vlcer. How one shal prepare the litharge of siluer, Plinie doth teach the same diuersly, we wil here admonish of his poison: when the same is drunken, then doth it make in the body, & in al the intrailes, not only an anguish, but also an extreme pricking & paine, it pierceth the inward parts, by his waight it stayeth vrine, it swelleth the body, and procureth a leaden colour. When as the patient hath vomited exceedingly, then are you to giue him wine to drink with the séeds of Clary sodden in it, Myrrh, wormwood, Isop, seeds of smallage, pepper, Ligustrum, or dried pigeons dung The fourth Chapter. Of the venomes that come of Beasts. WHat great commodities Almightie God hath giuen vnto vs in Beasts, is sufficiently knowne vnto all the world, and the same is to be séene in the foresaid parts of this booke, and in diuers medicines. For behold, what is more base and lesse estéemed than the Earthwormes that bréede in the stinking dunghils, and also liue therein, neuertheles they are vsed in grie∣uous sicknesses both inwardly and outwardly with great good. The ve∣nemous Scorpions and Vipers are wholsome medicines against venom and other diseases, and yet moe such like, whereof one might write whole bookes, as the books of all Phisitions and Philosophers do testifie; yea it hath bene found oftentimes that the ordure of some beasts hath holpen in deadly sicknesses. But to the contrary, there are foure little beasts not fearefull but hurtfull, against which hurts and harmes there are here very good remedies taught to defend & preserue one from them. For what is a more friendlier beast towards men than the Dog? What beast is more obedient, and can be lesse without the companie of men? Yet it is not vnknowne to all men how hurtfull and perilous the biting of a mad dog is; for if there be not presently very good remedies vsed a∣gainst it, then will the same man be mad also, and all other men that shall be bitten by the sayd mad man. Wherefore we will in this fourth Chapter speake of certaine venemous beasts and wormes, whereof we by the grace of God (in regard of the South countries) haue but a few in Germanie. Wherefore we will omit Basiliscus, Amphisibaena, Cerastes, Dipsades, and such like venemous beasts moe, which are to be found onely in Africa, and admonish of those that are knowne of vs, and adde vnto them the remedies that are requisite against their venome. The first are the Ants or Pismires, which truly are prouident and laborious little beasts, whereof we will not here describe the nature, but will discourse so much as serueth to our pur∣pose. Then it is found, that men through their pissing feele in their skinne, the which is more greater than is the stinging of Nettles, for the place thereof swelleth. They annoy also thereby all herbes and trées. And for to driue away the same from thence, you are to
take Cowdung, and temper it with vineger, and therewith annoint the body of the trée, or take Pitch or Rosin for it. They shunne also the smoake of Brimstone, and the fume of Marierom in such sort, that thereby they forsake their holes. Some affirme the same also of Cicorie, or (that is better to be beleeued) of Esula, which herbes and the smoke of the sulphur doth not only hunt them away, but also killeth them. These Ants and their egs are also vsed in phisicke. When as any man is stung of Bees, Waspes, or Hornets, then doth he not onely complaine of great paine and heate, but also of great swelling of the place where he is stoong, whereto you may vse this following most commodiously: Make a plaister of Linseede meale and salt tempe∣red with vineger: or stampe Hollihocke leaues and lay them moist thereon. You may also do the same with the flowers of Baulme. The same doth wild and tame Rue, the milke of new Figs, salt fish, and the pickle of the same. Item, sea water, when the place is often moistened there∣with. Take Treacle or Mithridate as big as a hempe séede, and annoint it thereon, or if you haue nothing else, then take the moist earth out of the garden, and annoint it therewith. It is said, that if one be once bitten of a scorpion, that then neuer afterwards neither Bée nor Waspe will bite him. The same is also written of the wormes that grow on Coleworts, when they are tempered with oyle, and annointed therewith. This is also worthy to be thought vpon, that when one beareth any odoriferous things, that then the Bées are the readier and gréedier to sting the same partie than otherwise. Although that there be no Cantharides or Spanish flies in Germanie, yet are they common at all Apothecaries. They are also very much vsed of the Chirurgions, and of other, as may be séene before in many places: but by reason that some most vnprouidently take the same in hand, and also will vse them inwardly, therefore cannot I con∣ceale their poison. These Spanish flies bréede of the Caterpillers or little wormes of the Figge tree, Peare trée, Fir tree, and Rose trée, &c. and when one drinketh them, then follow there after∣wards all maner of painfull symptomes, for that one may feele from the mouth euen to the neck of the bladder a sharpnesse and great exulceration: and he supposeth that he alwayes smelleth pitch, the right side swelleth inwardly, the vrine will hardly voyd, and passeth away with blood, and in going to the stoole there auoydeth the scrapings of the bowels, like to them that haue the bloudie flixe. They lie in great smart, are also féeble and impotent. The head swimmeth so much, that otherwhiles they fall to the earth, vntill at the very last they are bereft of their vn∣derstanding. And to remedy these grieuous accidents, there must be giuen to the patient Sallad oyle or some such thing to drinke for to bring him to vomit: and when this is done, then are you to minister vnto him a clister that is sodden with Rice, Hollihocke rootes, Fenegréeke, Linseed, Mallowes, and such like. If one may get the right Nitrum, then is it very commodiously vsed with Oxymel (our Salt-peter is not the right Nitrum) whereby the rest that remaine stic∣king in the stomacke and in the bowels might be washed off and expelled. Afterward you are to giue him wine and sodden Must to drinke, wherein is sodden Pingles or Cucumber séede. This may also be effected with milke or hony water: and in like maner also Goosegrease and sodden wine. There is a pappe of Barley meale to be layed vpon the swolne place, made with hony water. It is also to be noted, that at the first there must no plaister be layd thereon, for that will do more hurt than good. When all hath bin done that is abouesaid, then are you to annoint the body with oyles that be warme by nature, and then to bathe after it, so that thereby al that may hurt the body might be drawne out. You must also sée that the patient haue alwayes a loose body. He may eate Coc∣krels, yong Buckes or Kids, and Swines flesh that is very fat: And he shall also seeth Linséede with it, for that mollifieth and dampeth the eagernesse of the poison. He shall drinke excessiuely swéete wine. The rindes of Frankinsence and sealed earth, the one or the other, the waight of a quarter of an ounce taken with Must, is also much commended. Item, there is good for it the decoction of Penniroyall. Item, Orage, stamped Rue, and the iuice of the same drunken with wine. In like maner also Cow milke that is described in the third part, the twelfth chapter, and 11. §. beginning thus, Take Gentian, &c. But aboue all these are the Antidota good, as also both the Treacles, the Mithridate, Alexi∣pharmacon, and such like. It hapneth also oftentimes, that the people that trauell through the countrey do vnawares drinke an horsleach, which according to the olde wont without interceasing sucketh bloud within the body: but if it remaine hanging within the throate, thou may it be seene. But when
this hapneth, then must good héede be taken that you venter not to get it out with any tongs or other things, for that commonly they leaue their téeth sticking in the flesh, whereby afterwards grow grieuous impostumes, and it booteth not thereto that they be cut off, they leaue not there∣fore their sucking: and if they fall deeper into the body, and come to hang at the mouth of the stomacke, that is easie to be knowne by their drawing. Thus for to cure this accident, he is to drinke pickle of fish, or any other salt water, holding it in the mouth, and to gargarize there∣with. Item, Angelica sodden with Béetes. Further, take Rue, séeth it in vineger, and drinke it, or hold it in the mouth, according to the place where the worme is fastened. Or take Vineger that is heated with a glowing iron, melt butter therein, and giue the patient to drinke of this vineger. For this is also very good the meale of Lupins tempered with water, and the same hol∣den in the mouth. The Woodlice are a filthy stinking vermine, neuerthelesse they are said to be good against all venome, which if they be burnt, and the fume of them receiued, they cause the Horsleaches to fall off. The Flea is a vile troublesome and blood thirsty litle beast, which vexeth both man and beast: To driue them away or to kill them, there is no fitter meanes than that you keepe the chamber alwayes very cleanely, sprinkle it with water, and swéepe out the same cleane, for that they do grow of drie dust. Item, you may also vse these things following: Séeth Coriander in water, and therewith besprinkle the chamber, and also let the linnen be washed therein. This same driueth also lice away: yet note that of late was written of the Coriander, that thereby the head take no hurt. Item, take Coriander, wilde Thyme, séede of Tribulus aquaticus, and Elderne leaues, séeth them in water enough, and besprinkle the chamber therewith: this driueth away and killeth the fleas. The same vertue is ascribed to the smoake of Penniroyall, and the pow∣der of Rue strowed in the chamber: and all those things that may be vsed for Lice and Wood∣lice. The Italians and other nations moe haue a minde to eate Frogges, which other nations doe abhorre: but we will disswade all the world from them, and specially such as bréede in stin∣king pondes and waters, and are dunne, which are not like the right frogges, for they prouoke a swelling of the whole body, with a bleake and yellow colour, like vnto the Hollie tree: there∣upon followeth a short stinking heauie breath, hoarsnesse, and effluxion of the naturall séede. Now then for to remedie this mischance, you must let the patient vomit mightily, and drinke ouer much wine. For this also may you giue him of the Cipers roote beaten a quarter of an ounce. Further you are then to admonish the patient that he endeuour himselfe mightily to run, and walke much, or take some other exercise in hand, thereby to sharpen the body: and he shall bathe euery day. We haue said before, that there is no more perillous venome than that of a mad dogge. And concerning the madnes of a dog, it is most perillous in hot times: as when the Sun entreth into Leo, to wit, in the moneths of Iuly and August; which thirtie dayes we do not only call the dog daies of the Dog star, but also for that dogs in those daies are most inclined to madnes, and then hurt men most of all: wherefore the hunters during these thirty dayes ought to giue to their hounds meate tempered with hens dung. This madnes ceaseth also of it selfe when it begin∣neth to fréeze, and that but seldome. The signes of a mad dog are these; he wil neither eate nor drinke, and he fometh at the mouth and nose, beholdeth euery one ouerthwartly, and with a heauie looke, and biteth as well men as beasts. If a man be bitten by him, then is there at the first no other accident perceiued, but only that the wound cleanseth it selfe, and is very painful. Afterwards there followeth thereby a maruel∣lous extremitie, which the Gréekes do call Hydrophobos, which is the feare and fright of the wa∣ter, which oftentimes in the dogges and in men is so forcible, that they come out of their wits. Notwithstanding that they feare most of all the water, yet neuertheles they throw themselues into it and drowne themselues. This feare of the water they get not all at one prefixed time, but they get chiefly the same (that neglect the bit most) about the fortieth day, some after the sixt moneth, yea some also very well a yéere afterwards. The auncient Phisitions do write that this franticknes of the biting of mad dogs hath mani∣fested it selfe seuen yeeres after that they first were hurt by them.
They that are infected with this disease, do also get a conuulsion in all the sinewes of the whole bodie, and chiefly of the face, it will be red, and thereby cometh a great sweat, and ex∣treame féeblenesse. Some can abide no light, and others are vexed with an intolerable headach, many houle like Dogs, and bite all others that they can come by, who will be afterwards as mad as they. The auncient Phisitions write also that they be very few that do recouer. Yet for this hath bene found many wholesome remedies, whereof we shall speake hereaf∣ter. There are two kinds of meanes: the one common, which is good against all bitings and stingings of all venimous beasts: the second, that is, good alone against all biting of mad dogs, if one do but presently put it in practise. But if it be deferred too long, it is vsed in vaine. First, there are some things that a body must prouide to haue alwaies in a readinesse, that the same may immediatly be adhibited. Take for this Creuets, and burne them with as much of the rootes of Brionie to ashes; then powne them small and preserue them. Secondly, haue alwaies in a readinesse some smal beaten rootes of Gentian: and then if there be any bitten, cast in twelue ounces of strong wine, two spoonefuls of the ashes of Creuets, and a spoonefull of the foresaid rootes, and then drinke this at foure times, to wit, in the morning early. Item, for this is also commended the shels of the Lobster if they be powdered in drinke. Item, one other more that is made of Creuets, and is very like to the former, to wit, as her∣after followeth. Take Crduets that are taken in Iuly and August, burne them aliue to powder in a luted pot, and then giue the powder in drinke with Treacle, to wit, one dragme and a halfe with water of Scabious. Take also two or thrée dragmes of this powder, and drinke it certaine dayes together with the water of Fumitorie. Another: Take Gentian, and Myrrhe, of each one dragme, Ashes of Crabs a quarter of an ounce, giue thereof euery morning with wine: or if the patient be full of heate, then take foun∣taine water in stead of wine. Item, the iuice of Balme is also very good for this; or to beate the leaues to powder and drunken with wine. In like manner one may also twice a wéeke take a dragme in waight of the great Treacle, or of the Treacle Diatessaron, be it wiih Wine or any other distilled water. You haue also in the sixt Part, the fiftéenth Chapter, and twelfth §. a water of the great Bur, which is also wonderfull good against the biting of a mad dog. Now a daies is much commended (and that by experience) the iuice of Quinces if one take thereof once a day thrée or foure ounces, that the same will maruellously preserue one from this venime. And now to preserue this iuice, you must let it seeth so long by a mild fire till that the skum is separated and taken away; then you may preserue it in a glasse with a narrow mouth, and powre thereto a little Sallad oyle: it is also good for all other venimes. It is also written that clarified Hony taken daily should preserue one that he cannot be an∣noyed with the biting of mad dogs. In like maner if one eate the Lyuer of the same made dog, that the same should preserue the bitten person from all symptomes. The wild Roses powdered and drunken, are also found very good for it. Besides all these foresaid remedies, one may vse things that cleanse the infected bloud, which one may do with these medicines following, if the same be drunken fourteene daies together: Take sirupe of Fumitorie, of sweet Apples, and Pomegranates, of each halfe an ounce, water of Fumitorie, Buglosse, and Cicorie of each one ounce; mingle them together and drinke it fa∣sting. Afterwards vse this purgation: take new Cassie three quarters of an ounce, confection of Hamech one quarter of an ounce, Inda one dragme, make a Bolus or bit thereof with Cinna∣mom and Sugar, swallow it downe in the morning, and fast sixe howers after it. For this is specially commended, Hiera with Coloquint: For this is also good, thicke milke, called Lac scistum, for that it looseth, and doth withstand the venime. And as soone as the bodie is purged, and after that all the foresaid remedies haue bene vsed, it is then requisite, that one think vpon the biting or wound. First the biting is not to be healed, but it must be well rubbed with
Garlicke, vineger and salt, so long till it come to bléed apace. Some bind thereon liuing hens and pullets: but looke what is written thereof in the discription of the Plague, whereas we haue spoken of the Plaguesore. Make also a salue of the iuice of Onions, iuice of Rue, Vineger, and hony, wherewith an∣noint the wound three or foure dayes together keeping it cleane, the which will bring all things in securitie. This doth also Garlicke fried with Butter and layd thereon. Or an onion made hollow and filled vp with Treacle, and rosted in the ashes, whereof we haue before admonished. And you may also take two handfuls of Rue, frie it twice it butter, and apply it twice a day to the wound. Others take Garlicke, Rue, salt, Frankinsence, Mirrhe, of each a like much, beaten all together, and a plaister made thereof with wine. Take Cheruil seed, seeth it in faire water and drinke thereof, wash the wound also therewith: this is good without and within. The powder of Verueine is also commended for it that is gathered betwéene both our Ladie dayes for to strew on the wound. There is also good for it all Nettle waters drunken: likewise the Nettle séed stamped to grout and laid vpon the wound. The Fennel roote is vsed after the same maner. These are now things that may be vsed outwardly, and that not onely thrée or foure dayes as some suppose, but also some dayes together with other things moe. For as we haue admonished before, this venome doth otherwhiles not appeare in a twelue month after it: as may be seene, if one be bitten with a mad dog, and handleth a Rauen within a yeare after, that the same foule will be mad, or the man will be mad againe. It is also especiall good that the wound be annointed within and round about with Treacle or Mithridate. For this also are requisite the péeles of new Melons and Pompeons beaten and mingled with wine, and layd ouer the wound. Item, new onions tempered with vineger, or if the same cannot be had new, then are the same to be sod, and to drinke the decoction, and lay it also on the wound, or tempered with hony and wine, and so let it lie three dayes thereon. The kernels of nuts being chewed by one fasting and layd vpon the wound, should do maruellous much good. Or take great rootes of Smallage, séeth them in water and drinke the decoction thereof: stamp the rootes and lay them on the wound. Item, Rue mingled with Salt; these and the like things may be vsed at the first without all daunger. But in case that the vinome of this mad beast lieth hidden and dead a while, and the patient thereby supposeth to haue escaped all perill, the which neuerthelesse yet sheweth it selfe afterwards, wherefore there are diuers that haue a manly heart, and had rather liue a painefull life, than to die a painefull death. Of the actuall cauterie and incision. SOme that will play surely, and will preuent all these before mentioned mischiefes, do begin this cure at the first by incision and adustion, so that they cut out the sound flesh round about the wound according to the situation of the member, and also draw out the bloud, and make the wound much wider: for how much larger the wound is, so much the better will the blood be drawne out, and the better is the wound to be handled, which is to be committed to the expert Chirurgions: but burning is better than cut∣ting for it, and it is commended to be more surer and more forcible, because the fire tameth all venomes, and letteth not the same pearce and déeper into the body; and also the wounds heale not so fast, which must be kept open so long as may be. These things following are very requisite for to kéepe the wounds open, as all salt things, powned wilde Garlicke, iuice of Onions, and powned Wheate that is made moyst. These things make the wound wider: and after such kind of incision or adustion set on boxes, and sca∣rifie the sound flesh, that thereby the infected bloud may be sucked out. And if it be perceiued that the wound heale too fast, then must the same of necessitie be opened againe with fire, or with in∣cision, that there be no venome included. How the wounds are to be cured, that is knowne to al Chirurgions.
To conclude, this is to be added, in case that neither the easie remedies now mentioned, nei∣ther yet the incision nor adustion had bene vsed at the first, then are they to be omitted and left altogether, and not put the patient to such paine in vaine, for then cannot the venome that is spread ouer all the bodie, be drawne any more to the wound, neither be drawne out. An order of diet for them that are bitten by a mad Dog. ALl they that are bitten with a mad dog, must vse those things that do withstand poison, and interrupt the violence thereof, that the same penetrate not to the inward parts. For this doth first of all serue stong wine sodden throughly, and milke for his drinke: it is also good that you put into his meate, Garlicke, Onions and Leekes: let him vse Treacle and Mithridate sometimes. He shall feed euery day vpon eager and sower meates that do hinder the venome. Sweating before and after meate is also very good for him. But aboue all things is the Ellebore highly commended, if he vse the same but once in fortie dayes: for it is proued already that those that were vexed with the feare of the water, that they were only cured by the taking of Ellebore, when as they had vsed all other meanes and remedies before. Toades are beasts well knowne, that are full of colde venome. Against this is to be vsed all that which is described against the venome of the Frogs that haunt stinking pooles. That Lice be lothsome and filthy vermin and beasts, is knowne to the whole world, and hath sufficiently bene shewed in the first part, the third Chapter, and eighth §. Milke that is turned doth sometimes very quickly strangle them that doe drinke the same, for that through her clotting it stoppeth the pipes of the Lights. Against this must the Whay of milke be tempered with Vineger, and giuen to the patient to drinke, and the patient compel∣led to take it. The same doth also dried Nep, and the iuice thereof. In like maner also Angelica tempered with vineger and water. Item, Thymus with wine and ley, and some ashes with it. All salt things must be shunned, for thereby will the milke be turned more. In like maner must heed be taken from vomiting, for the clots might very well strangle one. Oxe blood is very grosse when it commeth first from the Oxe, it wil be soone hard and clotted: this stifleth a man also if he drinke therof, for it setleth it selfe at the vuula, and strangleth a man, it refrigerateth the sinewes of the throate, whereby the same is stopt: the toong will be red, and one may sée some part of the blood sticking betweene the téeth. He must also be kept from vomi∣ting, for the clotted blood remaineth in the throate. In this must the blood be resolued and the bo∣die opened. And for this are especiall good great Figs that are not very ripe, and yet full of milk, when they are giuen with vineger and water. The iuice of Beane straw with vineger, and Goosegrasse eaten, or vsed otherwise is also very good. All they that do recouer of it, do auoide much filth and other matter through their stooles, and the belly and stomacke must be often an∣nointed with Barly meale and Hony tempered together. Catterpillers (which are the right destruction and spoyle of all plants and gardens) are also in some sort venemous, yet the one more than the other: but they that liue on the Firre trees are the most venemous. If it chanced that any body swallow one of these, then presently doth he get a great paine throughout the whole mouth, and therewith a swelling of the belly, of the toong and the stomack, with a paine in the belly, that it seemeth that his belly is full of wormes, his whole body will be burning, and getteth a great distemperature in the stomacke. This ve∣nome is to be remedied with those things that are ordained against the venome of the Spanish flies: but in the stead of Sallad oyle, the oyle of Quinces is much better. Snakes and Adders are of diuers sorts throughout the world, and Africa, Media, Echatana, and Troglodytis, are maruellous much plagued therewith, euen as now a dayes Italy is in some places. Wherefore may Dutch men and English men account it for a blessing of God, that they cannot say as men do of Africa, that there are moe men slaine by venome than by the sword. And because this seuenth part discourseth only of poyson of venemous beasts, we wil adde here to the rest al the principallest things that are set forth by the learned against the biting of snakes and such like venemous beasts. Wherefore we will speake first of the roote of Aron, that is, Cuckopit: when Snakes are smo∣ked therewith, then will they be all as if they were drunken, and remaine stiffe. In like maner, when this roote is beaten to powder, mingled with oyle of Bayes, annointing the place
therewith where they do vse, then will they be hunted away. This roote is also to be drunken in red wine against all venome. If the fruite of the tree Platanus be taken with wine, then doth it withstand all stingings of Snakes and Scorpions. Elecampane rootes drunken in Wine, are also good against the stinging of venemous beasts. The ooe of Mandrgera is also good for it, principally if any must be cut or adusted for these venemous beasts bitings, for it bringeth the patient into a déepe sleepe, and maketh him wholy insensible, euen as before we haue taught. If blus be set on fire, then doth the smell of the same driue away all manner of Snakes. The leaues thereof layed in Wine, and drunken thereof, are also good against all kindes of poysons. The leaues of the Ash trée wroong out, and the iuice thereof drunken, and laid vpon the biting, withstandeth the poison of Snakes as vehemently as any thing in the world: For this tree hath such an antipathy with the venom of snakes, that the snakes shun the shadow of this trée. Plinus writeth also, that if one compasse them in one place with fire, and in another place with Ashen wood, that they had rather run into the fire than be touched with that wood. This bad worme doth also not créepe out of his winter hole, before & vntil that the Ash trée beginneth to blow, the which is a maruellous worke of nature. Moreouer, the Ash trée shal not let his leaues fall before and vntill that the Snakes be cropen againe into their holes. Right Balsam is commended against all venome of Snakes: but by reason that we haue not the same, there are many kinds thereof distilled, wherein euery one is to vse all diligence that he can to attaine to the right Balsam as néere as he can possibly: whereof you shall find diuers de∣scriptions in the last part, where you shall also haue liuing and golden waters which are very commodious for it. And for that England and Dutchland (as is already said) are almost frée from these bad beasts: we rest contented with the easiest and best knowne things: in like maner leaue the Balsamum artificiale to the charge of the Chirurgians. Teurium do the auncient Phisitions say to be the most precious remedie against the venome of Snakes, whether it be taken in drinke or layd vpon the bite. In like sort the great Teucrium, whether the same be taken greene, drie, decocted, or the iuice thereof. Mugwort is also taken to be very good for the biting of Snakes, if the same be layd in wine, and some thereof drunken and layed vpon the wound. Betony and all herbes of that vertue, as Gilloflowers, &c. the auncient Phisitions do write to haue such power against the biting of a snake, that if this herbe be layd round about her, she had rather be killed than créepe ouer the same herbe: for which cause the wine and conserue of this herbe are highly estéemed: so is also the powder and seedes of the same. Beuercod is good for many things, as is sufficiently before declared in the description of o∣ther sicknesses. And amongst other it is also good against the biting of snakes, and biting of other venemous beast, if the same be mingled with other things, according to the importance of the beast that hath fo bitten. This if it be vsed in time of néed, you may take thereof halfe an ounce with wine. Buckes and Goates haire set on fire driueth away all snakes. Penniroyall withstandeth all snakes by nature, by reason of the sauour or smell: wherefore it is to be strewed vpon the place where as the snakes haue bitten one, and be drunken with Wine. Purslaine eaten and applied also vpon the sore, draweth out the venome. It is also good for al other kindes of poison if one drinke the sap thereof with Wine or Hony: but the wild purslaine is the best. The iuice of the flowers of Selfeheale drunken with Wine, should be good for all the venom of beasts. The nuts of the great and small Cipers trées, which may be had at euery Apothecaries, stamped and drunken with Wine, are also good for this. In like manner the same Cipers herbe (which is to be found in many gardens) is very highly commended, for that it withstandeth all poison of snakes if it be drunken with wine. Nardus séede is renowmed to driue away snakes by his smell and sauor.
Dill mingled with Rue and Swines bread, with pepper, and so giuen to eate, is good against the biting of Snakes. Acornes are also good, to be drunken against this venome. Hens egges hard sodden, and tempered with Cresses, are good, being layed vpon the biting of Snakes. Verueine stéeped in wine and drunken, is very good likewise if it be layed thereupon. The roote of Gentian is in diuers maners good against venom, as before hath bene declared, but chiefly against biting of snakes: it is commended aboue all others if one take a quarter of an ounce thereof with wine. Pease meale tempered with vineger, drunken and laid vpon it, is also very good. The smoke or fume of Asses lights will also driue away venemous beasts. Venemous beasts cannot abide the smoke of Ferne, wherefore it is good that it be strewed vpon the places where they haunt. Fennell, and specially the seede of wild Fennell drunken with wine, is much commended for it. Haire of womens heads burnt, hath a maruellous power to driue away Snakes and Spiders. Galbanum is a gum that driueth away all venemous wormes. The herbe Cuckowbread, the waight of a dragme drunken with wine, hath many times bene approoued. Barly meale layd on with vineger, withstandeth venome. Some do giue the roote of Celan∣dine, the waight of thrée dragmes with wine, or make therof a salue, and lay it on the venemous biting of a Snake. The braines of a Cocke or Capon are also good for this being vsed in meate. The séedes of Mew is amongst other séedes most commended if the same be drunke with bitter Almonds, or the iuice of this herbe with bitter Almonds and with wine. In like maner also, if one be annointed with the oyle thereof, then doth it preserue him against the biting of Snakes. Hares rennet is very forcible against the venome of Snakes, and also for moe other things. Heath Erica is much commended against the venome of snakes. Harts horne hunteth them also away through his smell. The round and long Hartwort, the waight of two dragmes drunke with wine, or tempered with vineger and layd thereon, is also much commended. Dogs garlicke that groweth in vineyards, is also very forcible against the venome of Snakes. Cleuers haue also a speciall force against Snakes and their venome, if one drinke the waight of a dragme of them. Melilot hath this nature also, that it is sayed that there was neuer séene a Snake to haue come neare this herbe. In like manner the seede of it is much commended being taken with wine. Garlicke driueth away all snakes through his sauour and smell: it is also very good against all venemous stingings of beasts; and if one mingle it with bread and hony, then may it be ea∣ten for that intent. Coleworts with Barly meale layed thereon, or the iuice thereof tempered with vineger and Fenegréeke seede, is also very commodious. Corne mints do also driue Snakes away. The dung of all foure footed beasts tempered with wine, and layed thereon, is also com∣mended. Crabs that are caught in fresh water, and in the sea, are also very commodious for this, as we haue admonished in other places moe. Wilde Thyme hath also great vertue for it when the leaues thereof be drunke with wine: and the smoake thereof driueth them also away. All pickle of sallt fish is also highly praised for this vse, as hath bene taught elsewhere. The rootes of Louage with Barly meale, or tempered with wild Baulme and layd thereon, is also very commodious. Bayberries tempered with wine and drunken, is good against all cold venome.
Eringus the waight of a dragme drunken, tempered with water, and layed thereon, is also good. A liue Mouse applied to the place hath a speciall vertue for to draw out the venome: howbeit Hens, Pullets and Frogges are also very commodious for it, as we haue oftentimes shewed before. Must drunken is an vtter enemy to Snakes: so is all sodden and falsified wine. How forcible Nuts be, not onely against snakes, but also against all venome, if one vse them with Figs and Rue, we haue oftentimes declared before. Oleander, which the Gréekes call Rhododendron, is maruellous, for his leaues are venome to all fourefooted beasts, and yet a medicine for men against the venome of Snakes sodden with Rue in wine. Earewaxe rubbed on the bitting asswageth the paine out of hand. Pionie rootes, whereof there are two sorts, are both of them good for this purpose. Pepper is for all cold poisons measurably vsed, taken for a speciall medicine, euen as we haue declared in other places moe. Pistacies are also very good against all poison. That Rue is good against all venome, and against the biting of snakes, we haue already said in many places. The rennet of Faunes that die in their dams bellies, is commended to be maruellous for∣cible for it. For this is likewise commended the Madder. Radishes sodden with water and vineger, and layd thereon, are accounted very good. Great Centorie, which is called Rapontica, the waight of a dragme of it giuen with wine. The water of Larkes spurres is sayed (being drunken) to be good against the biting of all venemous beasts, if the biting be washed with it. The same is also to be vsed against the Plague. The iuice of white water Mints a quarter of an ounce drunken with thrée or foure ounces of wine, and the biting washed therewith, is much commended. The séedes of yellow Rapes or Turneps, and also the rootes and the herbe caried about one, will preserue him from the biting of Snakes: and if any body be bitten, then must the séed with the grease of any birds be stamped and layd theron. The séed of the common Rapes is very good against venome, being taken in the stead of Treacle. Salt is very good against all poison. Sugar is to be tempered with oyle, and layed thereon. Swines bread hath a great vertue against all venome, as we haue admonished in moe other places. The iuice of Scabious is also taken to be very good against all venome of Snakes and Scor∣pions. The thrée sorts of Dragons do driue away all venemous beasts if one carrie the roote about him. It is also good (being drunken) for them that are bitten of them. Léekes are also good when they are tempered with Vineger. Mustard seed is to be mingled with vineger, and applied thereon. They flie from the fasting spettle of man, and if they get it in their mouth, they must die thereof. Southernewood strewed on the place where the Snakes haunt, or where fume and smoake thereof is, driueth them away. Also Southernwood is good against all venome, being taken in∣wardly and applied outwardly. Codwort (which in Latine is called Aster) is also for this highly renowmed. Styrax Calamita, as the sent thereof is very acceptable to all men, so contrariwise there is no∣thing that Snakes may lesse abide. Tamariscus is good against all poison. Woodlice (albeit they be lothsome wormes) neuertheles they are aboue all things commen∣ded of the renowmed Phisitions against the poison of Snakes, and also against all other poison.
If the venemous Snakes euer come to sent or smel the leaues or wood of Iuniper, then créep they away: they are also good against all venemous beasts. Lysimachia is also commodious for all these things. The iuice of Onions applied to the biting of a Snake and tempered with Hony, is very good against venome. The Gnats that plague beasts and men with their sting in sommer, and in like manner all plants, are depelled by the smoke of Pomegranate péeles, and of Galbanum, also by the smoke of Nardus séed and Lupins. But forasmuch as (through the grace of God) we haue no Scorpions here in England nor in Dutchland, therefore it is no great need to write much thereof, by reason that all that is writ∣ten against Snakes is also requisite for the same; yet cannot we conceale this miracle, that the Scorpions themselues are a remedie against their owne poison, if the same be beaten and layed theron, or if they be rosted and eaten. In like maner you haue their oyle, and other their vertues moe described here and there throughout this whole booke. Spiders are wel knowne beasts, whereof there are many sorts described by the auncient phi∣sitions, which as they do differ in fashion, colour, and in weauing ther webs, so they do also differ in poison. Albertus doth describe eight kindes of them, which we haue all here in this countrey, Some do liue by catching of Flies: others by catching of water wormes and small fishes. Some also are enemies to the Toade and Snake; for that it hath bene séene that such Spiders haue letten themselues downe by one of their threds vpon the heads of such beasts, and leaue them not before and vntill they haue killed them. Other are deadly enemies to the yong Euets, which through their spinning do bind the mouth too, and do smother them, and hale them into their nets, that thereby they might sucke out all the moisture of them, and by the diuersitie of the venemous nourishment altereth also their venemous nature, whereby the same is some∣times more forcible or more milde. Also their manner of dwelling is not all one: there dwell many in houses, other in the fields and in the hedges: some dwell willingly by the water sides, but we will not write here any more of their natures, but discouer their venomes. Of all the venomes of the Spiders, that which the Greekes call Phalangium is the most renowned, and albeit that the same is not knowne in England nor Dutchland, yet we will describe the nature of this venome, whereby one may be taught to asswage all the lesser stingings, and the harme that may come thereby, and how the same may be cured. The Greekes call this species of Spi∣ders the Wolfe, for a difference from other Spiders that are not so noisome. These Spiders are hairy, and haue a great head. The shée Spider (which onely spinneth) bringeth thrée hun∣dreth yong ones at one time, and she receiueth also the reward of her noisome fruitfulnesse, to wit, that she is killed of her owne yong ones, and afterwards sucked out, which they would also do to their father if he with might did not withstand them. If then any body be stung with this Phalangia, then wil the place of the stinging be red, neuertheles without paine or heate, howbe∣it that it yeeldeth some moisture, and as soone as there is vsed any medicine against it, then be∣ginneth the body to shake, the sinewes of the knées and the inward parts wil be féeble, and they will be conuulsed as if it were the crampe, they take a great anguish in the members, the pati∣ent can scarcely make water nor go to stoole, he getteth a sweate throughout all his body, his eyes runne and are dimme. Against this must the ashes be vsed that are burnt of the Figge trée, tempered with salt and wine, and so laid thereon. Item, Hartwort, Barly meale, and Vineger tempered to pap. You are also to wash the sting with some water wherein Smallage was sodden. To bathe often is also very good. For this one is to take a quarter of an ounce of any of these séeds follow∣ing with wine, to wit, the séed of Southernwood, Annis seed, Hartwort seedes, the rindes of the trée Platanus, or the seede of Melilot. Item, the fruite or rinde of Tamariscus, or wild Cipers sod∣den in wine. Some wil say if one take the iuice that is strained out of Crabs with milke and séeds of smal∣lage, that thereby the patient will immediatly be whole. Plinius writeth of the water of Smallage, that the same hath a special vertue against the stin∣ging of the Spider. And there may be vsed against the Spider Marierome, Nardus séede, Southernwood, Hya∣cinthum,
iuice of Mulberies, field berries, and Framboyes, being tempered with hony and wine, or each also alone. Woodlice, albeit that they be good against diuers other venomes, yet neuerthelesse are they very lothsome to all men, shrewdly biting, and bloudthirsty, whereby they take away a bodies sweete sleepe, and spedially vexe the young children, for which there hath bene much counsell sough to driue them away. For this is very good the smoke of the great Ferne. Item, if Horseleaches be cast on the fire, and they be fumed with it. Birchboyes set in the chamber driue them also away. The water that we vse dayly for our necessitie hath by nature no venome in it, yet if one drinke it too colde, likewise strong Wine, and by and by after bathing, or after that one hath runne hard, then doth there ensue great paine and stitches, which diseases may be expelled tho∣rough letting of bloud and purging. Of the wormes that bréede in the belly grow diuers diseases. In like manner also of such that grow in the fingers, in the arse-gut, in the wounds, and other places moe. What is to be done thereto, that haue we sufficiently declared elsewhere. Thus for a conclusion of these venoms of beasts, and of the seuenth part of this booke, there is yet somewhat to be added that some account for witchery, to wit, when there is giuen to any body that which excitateth loue, by which commonly such miseries do follow, that they that receiue the same become mad and foolish, like as dayly experience doth teach vs. Ouidius writeth that Philtra doe weaken the wits, and by their vertues they make men foolish and mad. This do we call the louers herbe, as if witchery had power to commaund one to loue another. This witchery (or rather this poysoning) do women vse most of all, intending thereby to constraine men that they should loue them. The vngodly heathen that haue excelled therein, and chiefly the Thessalonians, haue taken great delight therein, and also strange misbeléefe, that are rather to be concealed than disclosed. It is very difficult to ordaine any certaine remedie for it, because it cannot well be knowne (for that there be so many kinds of them) by what meanes it hath bene put in practise, so that the same must rather be iudged by the signes apparant to the eyes, than by any other signes: yet haue I found out two things described by famous Phisitions, which are very good for this purpose: but the first thereof is very strong, and is not be vsed without counsell, but the other is somewhat safer and easily approoued. Take a Valerian roote with the herbe, fiue or sixe rootes of Gentiana Cruciata, a small handfull of the rootes of wild Cucumbers, and a quart of Wine with halfe as much water: afterwards seeth it softly about a quarter of an houre, and drinke thereof morning and euening: And you are to séeth therewith a little Cinkfoyle. The other: Take the middlemost gréene rindes of Elderne shread small one handfull, let it drie well, afterwards séeth it in a pint and a halfe of Goates milke till about the halfe, straine it, and drinke it as aforesaid. Hereof will some say, that the same purgeth all things whatsoeuer hath bene giuen vnto any body by women to this intent, although it had bene done thrée yéeres before. The end of the seuenth part.
The eight and last Part of this Booke, containeth sundry things. THe eight and last part of this generall Practise of Phisicke, is or∣dained for those things that do not concerne any speciall diseases, which are before sufficiently described, but that are méet and good for to helpe sicke persons, to strengthen the weake, and to maintaine health: which also may be vsed in the kitchin for pleasure, and for o∣ther purposed mo; as Electuaries, Potions, Conserues, and Confe∣ctions of all kinds of Fruites, of Flowers, of Rootes, and of other Plants: Oyles, Sirupes, and Iuices: Golden and vitall Waters: Hearbed and Aromaticall wines, and such like; whereof otherwhiles hath bene admonished, how that the same may be prepared, and to the end that the vertue of all them might be knowne. Wherfore we will also declare their ver∣tues and operations. The first Chapter. The Confection of Calmus. THis very precious and necessarie Confection, is prepared after sundry manners: for besides this, that it is very common, it is also very pleasant and acceptable. But first of all there is to be noted, that the auncient Phisitions had another roote, and not the yellow Lilly roote, which we haue now in vse: yea ours is not to be compared to the old Acoro, neither in vertue nor in operation. The learned do estéeme the Calmus to be the right Acorus, which is also very requisite for this Confection. Other be of opinion, that it is the great Galingal, which is also good for it: Wherfore (in mine opinion) this first Confection is to be vsed rather than the other following. And if so be that you had rather haue it with the tast of Sugar, than of hony, then boile Sugar to a sirup. First, we will describe one of the Confections of Mesua, wherof there is alwaies one found rea∣dy in all well furnished Apothecaries shops, and afterwards one other sort more, whereof each one may take that likdth him best: Take the roote Secacul, or in the stead of it, take of our pow∣ned Calmus, and prepared Pingles, of each sixe ounces: séeth the rootes in faire well water, and stampe them to grout: afterwards put sixe pound of the best well scummed hony vnto it, & then seeth it all together by a soft or gentle fire, vntill the moisture of the rootes be all consumed, and stirre it about, to the end that the rootes burne not: when as it is decocted thick enough, then take it from the fire, and temper these things following amongst them, powned very small; to wit, Pepper one ounce, long Pepper, Cloues, Ginger, Roses, and Mace, of each half an ounce, Nutmegs, Galingall, and Cardamome, of each thrée drag. temper them well together. This Confection is maruellous good against all diseases of the sinewes, it sharpeneth the wit, it aswa∣geth the headach, and is also good against all old sicknesses, but especially against all rheumes, which fall out of the head into the breast. The second: Take Calmus which beareth the yellow Lillies, which groweth in moist places, and is faire and of a horseflesh colour, 16. ounces, make it very faire and cleane: afterwards cut it in thin slices, and seeth it so long in faire water, vntill they be mellow, then straine the water well from it, and powre a pot of red wine vnto it, and let it boyle well, then powre the wine from it, and stamp it all to grout, and put sixe pound of clarified Hony vnto it, and let it séeth well with the wine vnto a Confection, at last put vnto it sixe ounces of Ginger, Cloues, Nut∣megs, Mace, Cardamome, long Pepper, and Galingall, of each one ounce and a halfe, Pep∣per thrée quarters of an ounce, beaten all together very small. The third: Take Calmus prepared as before, and chopt small, two pound, clarified Honie foure pound: séeth the roots very well in red wine, afterwards put them to the Hony, & let it so
seeth by a mild fire vntill it be very thicke; then temper therewith small chopt Almonds, eleuen ounces, Ginger foure ounces, Pepper halfe an ounce, long Pepper and Cloues, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cinnamom one dragme and a halfe, Galingall, Cucubes, Cardamome, Nutmegs and Mace, of each one dragme, stirre them so long together with a woodden pestle, vntill that it be cold. The fourth: Take drie sliced Calmus one pound, and séeth it in two quarts of small wine; afterwards powne it to grout, and take Hony or Sugar two pound, let it séeth till it be thicke, when it is a little cold, then temper with it small cut Ginger sixe ounces, powned Cloues, Nut∣megs, Mace, and Cardamome, of each one dragme and a halfe, long and common Pepper, of each three quarters of an ounce, Galingal one drag. and a half, Greins one quarter of an ounce, temper them all together. The fift: Take Calmus cut it in shiues, and take twenty ounces of it; séeth it in thrée pints of red wine, so long vntill all the wine be consumed; stampe it, but not too small, then take a pint of clarified Hony, and let it boile by a small fire, afterwards put the prepared rootes vnto it, and 8. ounces of small sliced Ginger, then let it boile againe by a mild fire, vnto a confection, when it is lukewarme, then temper with it common & long Pepper, Cloues, Cinnamom, Nutmegs, and Ginger, of each halfe an ounce, Galingall, Mace, Cardamome, Cucubes, and Greines, of each a quarter of an ounce beaten small together, temper them so long vntill they be all wa∣xen cold. The sixt with Sugar: Take Calmus as before, 12. ounces, séeth it in Muscadell vntill that the wine be all wasted, stampe it to grout, and put thereto foure pounds of common clarified Sugar, with as much wine or water, then put the roots vnto it, and let it seeth vntill it be thick; when it is a little cold, then temper amongst it Ginger cut very small foure ounces, Cinnamō, Cardamome, Nutmegs, Mace, Cloues, Calmus and Cucubes, of each thrée drag. temper them well, and let them seeth so long as one would séeth Egs hard, then kéepe it in a gally pot. How to make Veriuice for the Kitchin, and for Phisicke. §. 1. VEriuice is to be prest out of the best Grapes a good while before they be ripe, and if so be that one will kéep it long, then must the same be sodden: but if so be that you will vse this Veriuice in the Kitchin, then temper a good deale of Salt a∣mongst it, and stir it the space of an whole houre, afterwards put it into a small vessel, and cast some vnripe Medlars into it, then shake it well about, to the end it may worke and be cleare. But if so be that you will kéepe the Veriuice for Phisicke and without salt, then fill a glasse with a narrow necke, and powre vpon it some Sal∣lad oyle, then will it remaine good the space of a whole yeare. There may also be made of this vnsalted Veriuice a sirupe called de Agresta, to wit, in this manner: Take the iuice of vnripe Grapes, when it is first prest out, fiue parts, white Sugar 3. parts, and let it séeth softly vnto a sirupe: further, then clarifie it with the white of an Eg. This sirupe is maruellous good in great heate, it swageth thirst, allayeth all wambling, parbraking, and laske, which is caused of the gall: it is also very méete in hote cholericke Agues, and aboue all measure good for all women with child, which be inclined to vomiting, for that it strengthe∣neth the stomacke, and withstandeth all venime. The 2. Chapter. Of the artificiall Balme which may be vsed in steade of the right Balsamum. BEcause that the right Balsam is no where to be gotten, or although it be brought vnto vs, yet common people cannot haue the same, by reason of the dearenesse: wherefore haue many Phisitions endeuoured themselues for to di∣still such an oyle, which might haue the same efficacie and vertue: and verily the Phisitions and Chirurgians haue found therein an especiall operation, wherefore I cannot pretermit the description of some of them.
First, this ensuing is a very precious remedie against the poxe, against all diseases of the mother, and of the stomacke. Take faire cleane oyle of Turpentine sixtéene ounces, stop it very close; afterwards take La∣uander, Sage, Betonie, Roses, Rosemarie, Mints, and Bayleaues of each a small handfull, rootes of Angelica, of Ireas, of Valerian, Elecampane rootes, and Diptamus of Candy, of each one dragm, flowers of Burrage, of Buglosse, of Lauander, and flowers of Spike, flowers of Sage, of Cammomill and Stechas, of each one quarter of an ounce, Annis one drag. and a halfe, Piony rootes, Licorice and Spica of Indy, of each one dragme, péels of Citrons, and of Oranges, of each two scruples; stampe them all small together, and then powre vnto it the oyle of Turpen∣tine, and so let it stéepe the space of a whole day, with meetly much water with it, that it be co∣uered therein: afterwards distill it out againe in water, at the first with a gentle fire, vntill it be warme, and that so long as any oyle or water doth come out of it, afterwards separate the oyle from the water. Secondly, if you will distill it once againe, then put to the foresaid water and oyle 3. ounces of liquid Storax, and distill it as before. Thirdly, take red Storax two ounces, Frankinsence, Myrrhe, Lacca, Masticke, Bdellium, and Benzoin, of each one ounce and a halfe, stampe them all together and distill it as before. Fourthly, take Ginger, Galingall, Zeduarie, and Gentian, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cubebes, Cardamome, Greines, and Pepper, of each one dragme and a halfe, selected Ru∣barbe and Saffron, of each halfe a dragme, Nutmegs, Mace, Cloues, and Calmus, of each one ounce, stampe them all small together, and put it into a glasse bodie: then put vnto it againe the foresaid oyle and water, let it so stand and stéepe, and distill it afterwards, then separate the oyle from the water, and kéepe it well stopt. You haue also in like manner in the second part, the sixt Chapter, and third §. an artificiall Balme, which was ordained for the Emperour Ferdinandus, and another in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, called a Hypobalsamum. This following is also highly renowned: Take selected Myrrhe, Aloe, Indy Spica, Dragon bloud, Frankinsence, Bdellium, Balsam fruit, Saffron, Mastick, Gum, Stechas, red Styrax, Lau∣danum, and Beuercod, of each one quarter of an ounce, Turpentine thrée ounces and a half, yel∣low Cowslips halfe a handfull: further, distill them all together as is before said. These thrée last be very forcible against all Palseys, if the lame members be annointed ther∣with, and if that one do drink a drop or twaine thereof with wine, it is also very good. These Balmes be also good for all fresh wounds, so that they may be healed in two or thrée daies ther∣with. They be also very good against all diseases of the sinewes. Another which is common with all Chirurgians: Take selected Myrrhe, Aloe, Spica of In∣die, Dragonbloud, Frankinsence, Momy, Opopanacum, Bdellium, Ammoniacum, Sarcocolla, Lau∣danum, Balsam fruites, Saffron, Masticke, Gumme, and liquid Storax, of each one quarter of an ounce, fresh Beuercod two dragmes and a halfe, Muscus halfe a dragme, Turpentine foure ounces and a halfe, powne all that is to be powned, and adde the Turpentine vnto them with a little water, and distill all together in séething water, as is said afore. Of Beere. §. 1. COmmon Béere is made in this countrey of many kinds of Graine, as of Oats, of Barley, and of Wheat; whereby it is also of sundry natures: That which is made of Barley is cold of nature, in comparison of wine: that which is made of Barley and Oates, is lesse binding, and maketh also fewer winds, and doth also nourish lesse: that which is brewed of Wheate or of any other grain, is hotter, warmer, and more binding, the thicker it is, the worse; the thinner the better: that which is well Hopt, causeth one to pisse fréely, and looseth the body, but it is not wholesome for them that haue weake braines; and that is vnwholsomer wherin ye seeds of Rue be decocted, for that the drunkennesse of such Béere weareth away much flower, then the drun∣kennes of wine, for that it maketh grosse vapors in the head, and a tough flime, which will hardly be digested. If it be not well sodden, then doth it cause much wind, puffeth vp the
belly. But very old and well sodden beere, doth make people fat, increaseth the bloud, and (in women that giue sucke) the milke, and that especially if the same be brewed of good corne. Thus for to kéepe beere long, take about halfe a pound of prepared Coriander vnto a barrell of béere, and seeth the same in two quarts of the same béere, afterwards straine it, and wring it out, and powre it warme into the vessell, yet make it tight, and let it stand so still a day and a night. Some do take a new earthen pot, knocke the same in péeces, and cast it into the vessell, and put also vnto it a new laid egge. The 3. Chapter. Of Clarret wine, Hyppocras, and Herbwines. THese aromaticall wines and such like haue no certaine prescription, for that each one maketh them according to his owne good liking and plea∣sure, the one putteth much spice vnto it, the other much Sugar, and ano∣ther lesse of the one or of the other. Some do also make them with Hony, like as hereafter some do follow for an example. Take elected Cinnamom thrée ounces, clensed and smal cut Ginger and Greines, of each one ounce, Galingall one ounce and a halfe, Nut∣megs, Cloues, Cardamome, and Cucubes, of each one quarter of an ounce, being powned al together grosly, powre a quart of wine vpon it, and stop it tight, after∣wards set it a whole night in a warme place. This being all done, then take foure quarts of wine, and one quart of cleare skummed Hony, powre the Hony vnto a litle wine, and so let it seeth softly together: afterwards then powre the foure quarts of wine vnto it, and all the stée∣ped Spices, and let it coole a little, then powre it so thorow a straining bagge, and that so often∣times together vntill the wine runne cleare thorough it. This Claret wine may be put into a little vessell, and the spices thorough which the wine hath runne, are to be hanged in the ves∣sell in a long bugge, then will it remaine good a long time. This potion is very good against all cold and moist diseases of the head, of the braines, and thee stomack. It is also good for all cold women, and for all old people: it strengtheneth the digestiue vertue, prouoketh naturall heate, and consumeth the Phlegma. Another: Take Species de gemmis frigidis thrée dragmes, Aromatici Rosati one dragme, Cin∣namom one quarter of an ounce, white Sugar seuen ounces, good strong wine one quart, stéepe them therein, and powre it oftentimes thorough, as is said before. Of this Claret wine are they to drinke oftentimes which haue a weake stomacke, and an obstructed Lyuer, or to stéepe sometimes therein a péece of bread. A common Claret wine: Take Cinnamom, Pepper, and Greines, as much as you please, clarified Hony also as much as you list, powre it then all together thorough a woollen bagge, as before. You may also take Cloues, Nutmegs, and other Spices: in like manner also Sugar in stead of the Hony. You haue also in the third part, the eleuenth Chapter and 5. §. a Claret wine called Stella∣dia, which is much vsed in Italy. There is also another sort made which is almost like vnto some of the former, but there be not so many spices taken for it: to wit, but halfe an ounce of powned Ginger, Cardamome one dragme, and Sugar halfe a pound, or more, vnto a quart of wine, and so filtred together. There is also an aromaticall wine which is called Hipocras made thus: Take Cinnamom 2. ounces, sliced Ginger one ounce, Greines one quarter of an ounce, Galingall, Cloues, Nut∣megs, Cucubes, and Cardamome, of each one drag. of these grosse powned spices you shal take vnto a quart of wine one ounce and a halfe, according to that you will haue the Hippocrasse strong, Sugar halfe a pound or more; then set it in a warme place to stéepe a whole night, and afterwards powre it thorough the bag as al ye rest. There is commonly taken for this red wine. This Hipocras hath the same vertue as the Claret wine hath: yet are all young people to re∣fraine from such like drinks, and from Malmsey and Muscadell, to the end that they do not in∣crease heate by heate. This Hipocras and Claret wine may also be well made for all weake bodies, that it be somewhat laxatiue. But if so be that there be any sick persons which be forbidden wine, or if that he drinke not
the same willingly by nature, and that neuertheles the decoctions did not agrée with him, then may this potion following be made, called Hippocras fontis: Take Cinnamom, Figs, Cloues, and Ginger, of each one quarter of an ounce, Graines one dragme, good well water a quart, which is coloured well with red Saunders, and then put the spices beaten grosse into it, and let it boyle a little. If you will haue this potion swéeter, then put in some Sugar in the seething, or some Hony, and then let it distill thorough the bag, as is said before. You haue also in the third part, the twelfth Chapter, and 4. §. another aromaticall Wine, which might be placed among these. In the end of this part shall moe aromaticall wines be described. Of Clisters and their vse. §. 2. IF one know how to vse these Clisters aright, and to prepare them, then can there be no more profitable, nor yet safer medicine inuented. Therefore there be before and almost in all sicknesses so many kinds ordained, and thereby taught how that the same shall be prepared, that it is almost néedlesse to write any more of them. Neuer∣thelesse to prosecute this our methode, we will here discouer certaine common and mild Clisters. In smal Agues, and when the patient is weake or scant as yet recouered of some long sicknesse, then are these ensuing to be vsed. Take Mallowes, and Violet leaues, of each one handfull, boile them well together: take of this decoction twelue or sixtéene ounces, mingle Cassie, Honie, and course Sugar of each thrée quarters of an ounce with it, oyle of Oliues thrée ounces, Salt one dragme or somwhat more, temper them all together, and minister it reasonable warme: for such like Clisters may you take Hen or Mutton broth. Another that relaxeth and cooleth: Take Violet leaues and Mallowes, of each one handful, Mercurie, Béetes, and water Lillies, of each halfe a handfull, Lettice and Purslaine, of each somewhat lesse: séeth them in sufficient water, and take thereof as much as is before, oyle of Violets foure ounces, Salt one quarter of an ounce, and minister it méetly warme. In hote Agues: Take Béetes, Mallowes, Mercurie, and Violet leaues, of each one hand∣full, boile them all together in sufficient water, and then take thereof twelue or sixtéene ounces, Cassie, Hony, Sugar, Salt and Oyle, as is said before. When the patient doth complaine of great paine and wind in the belly, then boyle therwith grosse powned Fennell séed, Annis, Comin, and Caraway. There is also an especiall Cassie prepared for a Clister, in this manner following: Take Vi∣olet leaues with the flowers, Mallowes, Mercurie, Béetes, and Melilot, of each halfe a hand∣full, seeth the same in a little water, straine it and wring it out, then wash therewith the Cassie out of the Pypes, for to get all the black out of them, and then afterwards séeth it short, vntill it be thick, when as then you haue sixe ounces thereof, then put nine ounces of Sugar vnto it, and let it séeth vntill it be thicke enough. This Cassie doth loose very mildly. Of confected Seedes. §. 2. HEre we will now speake onely of all séedes which be confected with Sugar, as Coriander séede, Fennell séede, Annis, Comin, Caraway, and such like. Item, of some Fruits, as Almons, Pingles, Pistaces, Hasell nuts, Cucubes, and of other mo confected rootes, which may be confected with Sugar: and because the same by reason of the Sugar and otherwise are very pleasant, whereby they will not onely serue for the Kitchin, but also for Phisick, wherfore we will here describe the nature and operation of them all. We haue in the seuenth part often admonished of Coriander, and giuen a caueat of his ve∣nim, that the same ought not to be vsed vnprepared; otherwise it is by all Phisitions aduised, that morning and euening confected Coriander should be vsed: for it dryeth vp the ascending vapors of the stomacke, it strengtheneth and dryeth the brains, it is good against all swimming of the head, and against the Palsie; it is good for the stomack, and procureth sleepe, insomuch as then these vertues be ascribed to the Coriander, to which the Sugar addeth only the pleasant∣nes, you may looke what the Table saith of all the other seedes.
The confected Annis séedes are good for them which haue a stinking breath, and cannot sléepe, it prouoketh vrine, it quencheth naturall thirst, it taketh away the windinesse of the belly, it is good for all paines of the stomacke, against all diseases of the Liuer, of the Lights, of the Matrix, and it helpeth the digestion. It is also good against all hoarsnesse, shortnesse of breath, and especially for all cold diseases of women, and for all them which be much plagued with the Whites. Lastly, it augmenteth also much the milke in women. The confected Fennell seede is good against all poyson, and especially against the venime of Snakes, it moueth womens termes, it warmeth the backe, it asswageth the paine of the same, it breaketh the stone, it expelleth vrine, the stone, grauell, and the slime whereof the grauell is ingendred, it increaseth womens milke, it cureth sowre belchings of the stomacke, it is good a∣gainst all wambling and vomiting, it allayeth the Cough, and all hoarsenesse of the throate. But aboue all is this Fennell séede commended against the darknesse of the eyes, for it preser∣ueth people from all volines on the eyes, it sharpeneth the sight if one take the same morning and euening, to wit, after meales, and cheweth the same long. Co doth grow much in Apulia, it hath the same vertue with the Caraway. It is also very good for them which be plagued with the grauell, and can hardly make their water. The Caraway seede is hotter and dryer by nature than the Annis or Fennell, therefore it is stronger and more forcible; and especially doth it warme the stomacke, and all inward parts, it openeth all obstructions, it forceth vrine, it breaketh the stone, it expelleth sand and grauell, it driueth out winds, and it taketh away all paine and chollicke of the belly. The confected Almonds are good against all diseases of the Lights, and the throate, against all drie Coughs, and narrownes of the brest, it strengtheneth all weake people, and all them which do consume away. The bitter Almonds do expell vrine and grauell, they do dry the braines, and do hinder the ascending vapors, they withstand all drunkennes, and be good a∣gainst many diseases of the brest, and of the lights. The hasell nuts haue in some sort the same nature with the Almonds: but they with the red shales haue an especiall operation and vertue for all scowrings and laskes, and especially to staunch the bloudie Fluxe. All sorts of hasell nuts be more wholesome confected with sugar than otherwise, as one may see and reade in many places of this booke. The Pingles be also of the same nature with the Almonds, and be especiall good for all leaue folkes, for that they strengthen much: yet are the kernels to be layed 24. howers before to stéepe in Rosewater, and then to be dried againe, for they augment much humane séede. Of the confected Spices, Peeles, Rootes, and such like. §. 3. THe Ginger, the Cinnamom, the Cloues, the Nutmegs, the Mace, Cucubes, Orange peeles, Citron péeles, Marioram, and the sliced Licorice, are likewise confected with Sugar. These foresaid do kéepe all alike the properties of their natures, and be especiall good in time of the Plague, for that they make good breath, which will not lightly be infected. It is also to be noted, that all that which is to be confected for phisicke, must be couered very thin with sugar, but onely the spices may well be confected somewhat thicker. The common baked Ginger sugar is thus prepared: Take one pound of sugar, and seeth it with Well water, clarifie it as the sugar is wont to be boyled for baked sugar, and when it beginneth to be cold, then mixe fiue dragmes of powned Ginger amongst it, and when you see that it beginneth to be thicke, then powre it vpon a stone or a table, which is made fat with a little sallad oyle. Yet another baked sugar: Take Ginger two dragmes and a halfe, Cinnamom one quarter of an ounce, Cloues one dragme, Mace and Nutmegs, of each halfe a dragme, Sugar one pound, séeth it, and do as before. You haue in like manner also in the third part, the eleuenth Chapter and 20. §. a baked sugar, which purgeth mildly, whereof one may take a quarter of an ounce at once.
The 4. Chapter. Of preserued Fruits, Flowers, and other things. TO the end that all Fruites, Flowers, Rindes, and in fine, all that is preserued with Sugar or with Hony, be not parted from the former, therefore we will in this cha∣pter comprehend all that is preserued in Sugar, or decocted, as Conserues, and also declare their vertues. How to confect the Elecampane roote. §. 1. IN the spring of the yeare is this roote to be digged out of the ground, and the outtermost péeles to be cut off, the roote made very cleane, afterwards cut it in somewhat thicke shiues or slices: this being done, then séeth the same very softly in two kindes of water one after the other, to the end the bitternesse may be taken away, and be very mellow. Then lay them on a cleane cloth, to the end they may waxe somewhat drie. Put them in a leaded pot, and powre méet∣ly hard sodden Sugar vpon them (but that it be not too hot) vntill the rootes be couered. This shall stand so a day and a night, then shall the Sugar draw all the moisture vnto it, which as yet is in the roote, and afterwards powre the Sugar off againe, and boile it vnto a sirupe: this being done, then powre it lukewarme vpon it, and do this so often as the rootes giue any moi∣sture from them. These preserued Elecampane rootes be a very good medicine for all cold diseases of the blad∣der. They take away the piping of the breast, and the shortnesse of breath. They be also good against the Cough, the spetting of bloud, against the paine of the sides: they strengthen the sto∣macke, and the digestion: They cleanse also the same from all vncleane humors: they breake the stone, and moue womens termes: They separate also all tough phlegme of the breast, they heale the vlcers of the Lights, and all inward parts, and especially they warme the stomacke and the Matrix. To preserue blacke Cherries. §. 2. TAke blacke Cherries as they come from the trée, and then cut off the stalkes, for two pound of Cherries take one pound of Sugar, and séeth the same, and clari∣fie it: when it is then halfe boyled, put in the Cherries, and then let them séeth all together softly, to the end the Cherries do not breake, and that so long, vntill that the Sugar be drawne betweene the fingers with small thréeds. And when as now the broth is almost cold, then put the Cherries in a leaded pot with the stalks vp∣wards, for so they will remaine good a whole yeare. And in this manner shall red Cherries al∣so be preserued. These Cherries be not onely acceptable for them that be sicke, but also good for all kind of heate, they moisten the dry mouth, the tongue, and the throate, they quench thirst, they make appetite, and refresh debilitie. The conserue of Cherries is thus prepared. Take blacke Cherries as many as you please, let them séeth well in wine, wring them tho∣rough a cloth, or thorough an hairen strainer, and afterwards let it seeth againe vntill it be thicke, stirring it alwaies well about. Vnto thrée pounds of this iuice put two pounds of Su∣gar, and afterwards séeth them together to the full thicknesse. There may also a Conserue of Cherries be made with spices, as hereafter followeth: Take of the foresaid Conserue whilst that it is yet warme one pound, and temper powned Cinnamom amongst it, and Nutmegges, of each one quarter of an ounce, Ginger and Galingall, of each one dragme, Cardamome, Cloues, Mace, and Lignum Aloes, of each halfe a dragme. This latter conserue doth strengthen the heart more than the former.
Conserue of Eyebright. §. 3. TAke Eyebright in Iuly with the white flowers, strippe the leaues and flowers from the stalkes; afterwards chop them small, and take one pound thereof, and stampe amongst it two pound and a halfe of Sugar, and then set it in the Sun, and stirre it well oftentimes about. This is the Conserue of Eyebright which is very commodious for the Eyes, as in the first Part is sufficiently declared. It sharpeneth also all darke sight, it drieth the braines of all cold superfluous humors, it strengtheneth the Liuer, and openeth all obstructions, it expelleth the yellow Iaundise, and the Ague that procéedes of an vncleane stomacke. In conseruing of all flowers and herbes is to be noted, that all they that are hote and drie, as Lauander, Mario∣ram, Balme, Sage, Mints, and such like, one is to take to one pound of them, two pounds and a halfe of Sugar: but to all that is moist, as Burrage flowers, and Buglosse flowers, &c. is but two pound to be taken. Conserue of Betonie. §. 4. BEtonie is very highly and woorthily reputed of all Phisitions, whereof there be three kinds, to wit, browne Betony which is the vpright Betony, and also the Conserue which we will here describe. The second kind are our Gilloflow∣ers. The third sort be Cowslips, wherof we will speake hereafter in their due place. This Conserue of Betony is therfore not vniustly commended, séeing these vertues ensuing be ascribed vnto it. Some do write that it is good against the crampe, against the palsie, and against the falling sicknes; it is also good against madnesse, against spitting of bloud, and against the Sciatica; this herbe is also good against all paine of the stomacke of the kidneys, and of the bladder, of the liuer, milt, and of all inward parts, it expel∣leth vrine, it looseth, and it helpeth digestion: it is also good against belching, it cleanseth the breast, it withstandeth the dropsie the Ague, and it moueth womens termes. In fine, it is espe∣ciall good for all inward sicknesses: lastly, it is also good against all venime. If that one desire to make a conserue of it, then take onely the flowers for it, which are to be powned together with Sugar, like as is taught at the first. How the greater Pimpernell rootes are to be pre∣serued. §. 5. TAke the rootes of the greater Pimpernel which be about one finger thicke, wash them well, scrape them, and cut them in peeces about the length of a finger: but cut them longwise, & take out the heart of it, then powre fresh Well water vpō it, and let them séeth like as is said of the Elecampane rootes, but they must not vtterly lose their bitternes. This being done, powre decocted Sugar, or Hony vnto it: and when it is waterish, then boyle it again, and that so often as is néed∣full. These rootes expell vrine, grauel, and the stone, they strengthen the kidneys and the blad∣der, they cleanse them from all vncleannesse, they asswage all paines of the bowels, which do come through cold causes, and they be good against the suffocation of the mother in time of the plague, they be good against all bad ayre if they be holden in the mouth. How Peares are to be preserued after two waies. §. 5. YOu may take such Peares as you thinke good which be new gathered from the tree, but none other but those that be sound. If they be too hard, then let them lye in a warme place the space of thrée or foure wéekes, vntil they begin to be som∣what mellow: but handle them not much, for that thereby will they quickly rot. If so be you will preserue them, then haue an earthen pot ready and lay in the bottome of this pot some dried Vine leaues or Nut leaues, & theron a lay of Peares, &c. leaues and Peares vntill that the pot be full: afterwards fill vp the pot with old
wine, and lay some heauie thing vpon the top of it that the Peares may not swimme. These Peares may be vsed for meate, and also for sicke persons for a comforting. The common peo∣ple which haue no wine may do it after the same manner with water. But if you desire to haue them of a better tast, then take Ginger which is made very faire, cut the same small and strew it betwéene each row. Item, take a new pot and put Peares into it (like as is said before) make the pot as close too as is possible: afterwards lay it so in a vessell with Wine, then will they remaine fresh and good the space of a whole yere. These Peares may otherwhiles be rosted in the ashes, and strew them with Fennell seede; and also after supper to eate them, thereby to close vp the stomacke, to the end the bad vapors may not ascend towards the head: they streng∣then also the braines, and be especiall good for the sight. If one will preserue Musk peares, then are they to be gathered in faire drie weather, and in the decrease of the Moone, and when they be very ripe, then take of the very fairest and soun∣dest of them, pare them very thin, cut off the stalkes and the flower on the top: then make readie a cleane sirupe of white Sugar which is well boyled: when you will take the same off from the fire, then lay the prepared Peares therein, and let them séeth two or thrée waumes to∣gether, afterwards coole a day and a night. This being done, seeth the Sugar once againe, and then lukewarme powre it vpon the Peares, and do that so long vntill that you see that the sirupe waxeth no moister, otherwise they cannot continue. If you will haue them pleasanter, then put Cinnamom vnto them, and they will be the better for the stomacke. These Peares do comfort and refresh all sicke folkes that do loath meate, and they close vp the stomack against the ascending of all bad vapours: if they be eaten at the first sitting downe to meate, then do they bind the belly. But if one can get no Musk Peares, then may other be taken in their stead which be likest of all vnto Muske Peares in smell and tast, and to prepare them as is expressed. How Oranges are to be preserued. §. 7. THis Apple is woont very seldome to be confected, but his péeles very often, the which are thus prepared: Take fresh Orange péeles, cut the white out, and cut the yellow long∣wise: afterwards let it séeth so long as one would séeth an Egge hard, and afterwards let the broth runne off. This being done, then powre Sugar vpon it which is well boyled vn∣till that be well couered, and so let them stand the space of eight daies in the same, then be they prepared. Oranges are prepared also as followeth: Take the outtermost of fresh Orange peels and cut the yellow the longest way; afterwards séeth the same in water vntill that the bitter∣nesse may come out of it. Powre the liquor from it, and then let it séeth againe vntill that they be thorough mellow (to wit in good wine) then stampe them to grout, and at last put good Malmsey vnto it, and so much Sugar as you please, and so let it séeth well together stirring it alwaies well about. Some do lay them to stéepe in a strong ley, and afterwards stéepe them in water. But it is not so good, for that their force will be thereby much abated; so that it is bet∣ter to séeth them in two or thrée waters, to the end that they may lose their bitternesse: they strengthen the heart and the vitall spirits, and therwith also the stomacke; they do helpe the consumption, and drie the braines. Conserue of Burrage. §. 8. AMongst the learned there is debate, whether the name betwéene Burrage and Buglosse, be exchanged, but therin is no great importance, by reason that both of them are of one nature, to wit, that the same are to be vsed in all venimous and pestilentiall Agues; they do strengthen the heart and all vitall spirits: they withstand all venim, and all heauinesse of mind, and they do also cleanse the bloud from all melancholy. In fine, they coole all inward parts. This Conserue is made of the blew flowers, as we haue taught before.
How Calmus is to be preserued. §. 9. TAke faire perfect Calmus, powre faire Well water vpon it, and let it séeth to∣gether, vntill it be thorough mellow, and that it loose some of his bitternes: af∣terwards make these rootes faire from the outwardmost peeles, and from all o∣ther vncleannesse. If so be that some do swell too thicke, then cut them long∣wise; and in case that they be too bitter, then let them séeth once again in water: and then afterwards lay them to dry in a sieue. The Sugar is certaine times to be decocted, like as is taught before, vntill that all the moisture be wasted. This confected Cal∣mus is most in all his force like vnto the Ginger, and especially it is very good for all debilitie of the stomack that is burthened with some cold humor, for that it consumeth the same humors, and besides this, strengtheneth the stomack: if it be taken in the morning, then doth it keep folks from all pestilentiall ayre, and maketh a swéet breath: it expelleth water, and is especiall good for all diseases of the bladder and the kidneys; it forceth the stone, and the grauell, and it prouo∣keth womens termes: it is warme and dry by nature, and hath an especiall operation for to o∣pen all obstructions, &c. How Citrons are to be preserued. §. 10. A Common manner to preserue Citrons in Sugar or in Hony, is this, that one peele off the yellow rinds, and cut the white pit in round or long péeces, and then to separate the sower with the séedes from it. Further, the same is to be boyled in a water or twaine, to the end that the bitternesse come from it, and therewith may be mellow and soft: afterwards is boyled Sugar to be powred lukewarme vpon it, and deale with them, like as is taught of the Elecampane rootes. This preserue is very good against all venime, it strengtheneth the heart, and all vitall powers: it is moist and cold in the first degrée, and it is very safe to be taken. How Citron peeles are to be preserued. §. 11. TAke the péeles of Citrons, which be not péeled too thin, but that there remaine some of the white with it, and do therewith as is said of the Orange péels. These péeles be warm and drie vnto the third degrée, wherfore they are but seldome to be vsed: but in cold sick∣nesses they do helpe digesture, they withstand all melancholicke humors, and also all diseases which may procéed thereof. How Berberries be preserued. §. 12. YOu must take of the very fairest Berberries that you can get, and wash the same very cleane, afterwards séeth them in a sirupe of good Sugar, and when the sirup is sodden short enough, then cast the Berberries vnto it, and let it seeth so softly a short time, so that the berries do not breake, and then preserue them in a glased pot. They be good against all heate and all other inflammation of the bloud, and especially of the stomack and liuer; they comfort sicke persons in great thirst, they moisten the drie toung, the throate and all the mouth. There is also a con∣serue made of this fruite, and that in this manner following: Take Berberries as before, and seeth the same in wine: afterwards straine them thorough a sleue, or searce, or thorough a cloth, and then let it be sodden vnto a Conserue, stirring it alwaies about. This Confection stoppeth the bloudy fluxe, & cooleth the bloud which is inflamed of Cholera, it obstructeth womens terms, and maketh appetite to meate, it is alwaies somewhat stronger than the Conserue of Raspes. Otherwise hath it the same vertue or operation: the Apothecaries do call it Rob de Berberis. Conserue of Fumitorie. §. 13. THis bitter herbe Fumitorie, is very well knowne; if you will make a Conserue of it, then take the flowers of it, and powne the same with Sugar, as other Conserues, and as we
haue taught of Eyebright. This confection is especiall good for all thē which be full of vncleane bloud, and also for all them that be plagued with scurfe, with the Poxe, and with such like vn∣cleannes: it keepeth men in health, and also from all venimous ayre. Of this Conserue may fréely be taken, as much as the quantitie of a great nut, before that men will bath, for that it expelleth out the sweat, and al bad humors of the bodie: therfore it is also good in the beginning of the Dropsie, for that it openeth the liuer and all obstructions of the inward parts; it driueth out the yellow Iaundise by the vrine, and is very commodious for many other things. How the Conserue of the fruite of the wild Rose tree is to be made §. 14. WHen as the fruits of these wild Roses (which be called Priestpintle) begin to be ripe, then take as many as you please, and séeth the same with red wine vn∣to pap, afterwards wring it thorough a sieue, or searse, & so let it séeth wel with∣out putting any other thing vnto it, with a continuall stirring about, as ano∣ther conserue. This Conserue hath a maruellous operation for to stop the scou∣ing or laske: it is also good for all wambling of the stomack: others do make it to a Conserue with Must halfe decocted, wherwith they seeth it againe, and cast certaine slices of Marmalade vnto it, which is especiall good for a cold stomacke. This Conserue is more in vse with ye common people, than at the Apothecaries, wherfore we will speake the lesse thereof. How Abricockes are to be preserued. §. 15. THe skins of these Abricockes are to be pluckt off softly, then powre vpon them Sugar decocted hard, not ouer hot; then let it stand so the space of one day, or somewhat lon∣ger, afterwards séeth the Sugar againe and that so long as the Abricockes do yéeld any moisture from them. Their vertue and operation are like to Peaches. Conserue of Elderne berries. §. 16. FIrst for to write of the Conserue of Elderne berries, the same is holden by the auncient Phisitions, and also amongst the common people, almost in steade of Treacle, and that not without cause, as you shall heare hereafter: and is thus prepared: Take ripe Elderne berries, strip them with a caule from the stalkes, wring out the iuice and let it seeth by a mild fire vnto a pap. This Conserue is to be taken against all inward venime, it cureth all vlcers and swellings, it ex∣pelleth by sweat all bad humors and corruptions: wherefore it is to be taken before that one do go to the bathe: but this cannot be done but onely after purging, and that fasting. If this be so vsed, then doth it consume the Dropsie at the beginning. It hath also bene found, if that this Conserue be spread vpon the Rose, that thereby it will immediatly weare away. If thou wilt make Conserue of the flowers, then take the flowers when they be very ripe, shake them from the stalkes, and let them drie betwéene two clothes: afterwards shread them small, vnto a pound of flowers, take two pound and a halfe of Sugar, powne them well together: afterwards set them in the sun, and stirre them oftentimes about. This Conserue o∣peneth the Liuer, driueth away all swelling of the belly, and all beginning of Dropsies, &c. How Ginger is to be preserued. §. 17. TAke faire white Ginger, of the fairest races, and lay the same to stéepe the space of certain daies, or so long vntill that the vppermost péeles will be pared off, thē take them off, and make them very cleane, afterwards powre fresh ley vpon them, and let them stéepe, to the end that they may swell thoroughly: and when as they be waxen very mellow (which may be perceiued by cutting them tho∣rough) then powre of the Ley, and wash them well with swéet fresh water prick them oftentimes with a small knife ouerthwart, and afterwards lay them a day and a night in
swéet water, to the end that the sharpnesse of the ley may be taken away, and do this so long vntill you can perceiue no sharpnesse of the ley any longer: then spread the Ginger vpon a foure cornered linnen cloth, that the linnen may draw the moisture out of it; but if so be that the cloth be thorough wet, then lay it on another drie cloth againe. Some do spare this la∣bour, and lay it vpon sieues, when it is then very drie, then haue a sirupe readie, which is made of Sugar, or clarified Hony, and then do therewith like as is taught of the Elecampane rootes, but aboue all haue good regard that the sirupe be not powred too hot vpon it, for that therby the Ginger will shrinke, yea be hard and vnpleasant: then kéepe this Ginger in a gally pot. This confected Ginger is very good for all cold phlegmatick sicknesses, and for a cold weake stomack: it taketh away all vapors that do ascend from the stomacke towards the head; it warmeth all the bodie, and all inward parts. At euening when one goeth to bed a good péece taken of it doth dry maruellous much the braines: Thereby will also the parts of generation in men and wo∣men be strengthened. But this may be gotten preserued gréene out of ye Indies, which is much better, than that which is preserued in this cuntry. The same was wont before times to be pre∣serued after an easier manner, to wit, in this manner following: Take white Ginger as much as you please, burie it the space of 14. daies in moist sand, and wash it afterwards with a sharp ley, lay it afterwards againe the space of fourtéene daies in Rosewater: this being done, make a sirupe of Sugar, or of Hony, or both of them tempered together, cleansed and scummed well, and then lay the Ginger in this sirupe: But I cannot commend this manner of doing. How Raspes are to be preserued. §. 18. YOu must take the Raspes as they hang vpon the hedge, wash the same very cleane, and make them faire, if there be any vncleannesse with them, and then make readie a clarified sirupe of Sugar, and when as now the sirupe is almost boyled, then cast in the berries, and let them seeth softly therein a good while that they may not breake, and do not also coole. Their Conserue is made as followeth: when the berries be very ripe, then strip them from the stalkes, and wring the iuice thorough a cleane cloth; afterwards let it séeth softly, stirring it alwaies about vntill it begin to be thicke, then put as much Sugar vnto it as you please, and séeth it away like as all other Conserues. You may also boile this iuice without Sugar, and it is also better for Phisicke. The Apothecaries do call the same Rob de Ribes. This Conserue hath an especiall vertue to slake thirst, and to moisten the drie toung, and all other inward parts, it maketh appe∣tite, and that especially in hot times. In like manner may also this decocted iuice be tempered with wine, and vsed as a sauce amongst other meates. How the Conserue of Hyssope is to be made. §. 19. IN Iuly, take the flowers of this herbe, and sugar also with it, powne them well together, like as we haue taught of Eyebright. This Conserue is very good for the breast, the lights, and such like parts: it is also good against the cough, the narrownes of the breast, and against the short breath; it consumeth and drieth all cold rheumes: it excéedingly warmeth the breast, it strengtheneth the sto∣macke, the head, and the braines: it taketh away all ascending vapors; and is good against all poyson, and also very méete against all coldnesse of the inward parts. Of the Conserues of Lauander and of Spikenard. §. 20. BOth these herbs are found to agrée so neare in operation that the Spica is called the male, because it hath bigger leaues and eares, and the Lauander the female. Of both these herbes are the flowers onely taken, & for euery pound of flowers two and a halfe of sugar, or otherwhiles thrée pound of sugar, because they be strong: beate them well together. This Conserue is very good for all cold dis∣eases of the stomacke, and for all windines of the same, it easeth the paine in the belly, and the ascention of the Mother, it openeth all obstructions of the Liuer, it moueth vrine,
it dryeth the cold and moist braines, it is good for the sinewes, Palsey, and lamenes that procée∣deth of them, it restoreth the lost spéech, it taketh away all cold rheumes that fall out of the head into the eyes, téeth, and other parts, and this conserue is especiall good against the corruption of the gummes. How to preserue the Eryngus roote. §. 21. THis herbe is called of the Phisitions Eryngium, the rootes only of this herbe be pre∣serued. The same are digged vp in the spring time or in haruest, wash and scrape the same wel; afterwards cleaue them in the length and take out the hart, then cut them in meane péeces, séethe them and prepare them as you did Calmus and the greater Pimpernell rootes: or you may leaue them long, put only the pith of them out and sticke it about with Cinnamom and Cloues, which giueth it a pleasantnesse. These rootes be also very good for them that haue any disease in the Liuer, they do take away all paine of the Milt, the kidneys, and backe, they driue away the chollicke, they mooue vrine and womens termes; they be also good against all venime, and against all pursiuenesse in the brest, they frée one from the crampe, and of the falling sicknesse, they do warme the parts of genera∣tion, and be especiall good for a cold stomacke. Conserue of Marioram. §. 22. OF this herbe are the leaues onely to be taken, and powne them with Sugar like the Eyebright: this Conserue is of a drie and of a warme nature it is e∣speciall good for all moist and cold diseases of the braines, of the head, and of the stomacke, it openeth all obstructions of the liuer, and all inward part, it doth strengthen the heart, and it hath the same vertue with the conserue of Lauander and of Spikenard. Conserue of Balme. §. 23. A Conserue of this herbe is especiall good for all biting of Scorpions, of Spiders, and of Waspes, and is also good for all biting of mad dogs, the same being eaten or laid vpon it: it moueth womens termes, it asswageth all tooth ach and paine of the ioynts, it fréeth one from the poyson of the Toadstooles, it stayeth the scouring Dysenteria, and taketh away all collickes, it driueth away all pensiue∣nesse, it strengtheneth a cold stomacke, it warmeth the breast, and giueth a light breath, it cleanseth all vlcers, and is good against all darke sight: of the white flowers of this herbe is also a Conserue made like as of all other flowers, which neuerthelesse is not much in vse. How Nutmegs are to be confected. §. 24. OF Nutmegs take the very best, lay them to stéepe in sharpe ley which is made of woodashes, and let them lye so long therein, vntill they be thoroughly steeped, yea mellow and soft: afterwards powre away the ley and peele off the vppermost gray skinnes. This being done, powre fresh water oftentimes vpon it, to the end that the sharpenesse of the ley may be drawne away againe: then let them drie in the shadow in a Sieue: prepare afterwards a sirupe of Sugar which is well decocted, and so powre it luke warme vpon them; and if it waxe waterish, then séeth the same againe, and that once euery thrée or foure daies vntill that the sirupe continue thicke. These Nutmegges be of a drie and warme nature, they strengthen the head, the braines, the hart, and all vitall spirits, they in∣crease naturall heate, and all naturall powers, if so be that one take the same in the morning fa∣sting, and in the euening after meate. They do consume all noysome and superfluous humors of the inward parts, they do strengthen the stomack and make fresh bloud, they yeeld a good and odoriferous breath, they ease all swellings and hardnes of the spleene, and they be especiall good
against all cold diseases of the Liuer: but they be not so good for the Lights: they haue great po∣wer for to dry a moist head. Now adaies be they brought out of Indy preserued gréene, which be much better and forcible, than they which be preserued in this countrey. Conserues of Gilloflowers. §. 25. DIuers kinds there be of these well knowne flowers, the red well sauoring be ye best to make a Conserue of, cut the vndermost white from it and vse the leaues alone, and the white are you to cast away; the same is to be pouned with Sugar like to other Conserues. This Conserue hath the same vertue that the conserue of Betony hath, for they are also a kind of Betonie. These Gilloflowers are es∣pecially commended against all venime: this Conserue is also very good for the head and the braines, drying and warming the same, it allayeth also the shaking and shiuering of the quartaine Ague: it is also somewhat bitter, and is therefore good against all wormes ta∣ken fasting, it is good against the paine of the téeth, it withstandeth drunkennesse, and breaketh the stone. This may also be vsed as a preseruatiue in time of the plague. How Walnuts are preserued. §. 26. ABout Saint Iohns tide take gréene Walnuts and pricke them through with a bodkin, and péele off the gréene bitter shales from them; afterwards lay them 8. or ten dayes in fresh water or in running water which is more better, and they need not so much time also for it. When as now they be quite rid of their bitter∣nes, then let them séeth softly, vntill they be somewhat mellow, but not tho∣rough soft: and afterwards let them drie in a sieue, and then sticke their holes with Cinnamom, Cloues, and Orange péeles: also séeth the Sugar somwhat short, as we haue taught in the preseruing of the Elecampane roots. Some do pricke it without, but they put Cloues, Cinnamom, Galingall, Mace, Cucubes, and Cardamom in the sirupe, each according to his good liking: but if so be that you will preserue them with Hony, then it is not néedful that one péele them. These Nuts be commonly vsed at banquets, notwithstanding that they be also good for Phisicke: they that be preserued with spices, do helpe digestion and do warme all in∣ward parts: they close vp the stomacke after meate, and do stay the ascention of the vapors, yet they are very seldome vsed in this Booke. Here we will also admonish and teach how that one shall kéepe ripe Walnuts a long time fresh, that the kernels may be péeled: for this are you to take good new nuts, bury them in sand, and when you will vse them, then wash away the sand. Or take a new pot, and strew therein a lay of dried Vineleaues, and then a lay of Nuts, and so foorth, vntill the pot be full, wherein they will last long and kéepe their tast. Conserue of Buglosse. §. 27. WE haue before admonished in the description of the Conserue of Burrage, that both of these be of one nature and of one operation, wherfore it is not néedfull to discourse thereof more at large. How Apples are preserued. §. 28. APples may be preserued as we haue written of Pears, some do powre vpon them wine∣lees, and they wash them when they will vse them: Apples do coole the hot stomack, they do attenuate the tough slime and quench thirst.
Conserue of Pionie. §. 29. TAke the leaues of Pionie flowers (which do blow in May) and powne them very small, vnto a pound of Flowers take 2. pound and a half of Sugar, & set it the space of thrée moneths in the Sun stirring it about euery day. This Conserue is very good against all fantasies, against the hag or nightmare (as some tearme it) against the falling sicknesse, and swimming of the head, against the diminishing of the sight, and all diseases of the braines: it moueth womens termes, and clenseth them after child∣birth: it is also good for the grauell, and for the yellow Iaundise, it suppresseth the vapors of the stomacke, it refresheth women that be vexed with the suffocation of the Matrix, it is also maruellous good against the pangs of children, and it letteth the growing of the stone in them: if so be that the children be too small that one cannot giue it them, then are the nurses that giue sucke to vse this Conserue in abundance. How to preserue Peaches. §. 30. WHen the fruite is ripe, then is the same to be plucked off with the hand that it may not be brused: those Peaches are estéemed to be the best to preserue which be ripe about Saint Iohns tide, and be somewhat smaller than the other: the vppermost skinne is at the first to be péeled off with a knife, and the sirupe (like as is said of the Musk peares) to be sod vntil it be thicke. They haue almost the same nature that the Muske peares haue, they comfort and strengthen the sicke persons, they be good for the thirst, they moisten the dryed toong, they do coole all inward parts, and be very good in all hote sicknesses. In this manner be the red and the wine Peaches preser∣ued: péele the same and take out the stones; afterwards lay them in an earthen pot, and powre vpon them clarified and thicke Hony. These Peaches be not so pleasant as the other, but they be well as forcible as the small, and they may also be prepared with Sugar. And because that some people may not abide the tast of Honie, it may be washed off before they be vsed with wa∣ter; it is also in the third part (where we speake of the bloudie Flixe) declared how these Pea∣ches are to be dried and vsed. Item, the hurt which these Peaches do through their cold and moisture, that will be remedied through eating of their kernels, or with a draught of wine. The flowers or blossomes of Peaches may also be preserued with Sugar as other flowers: this conserue is very necessarie for children against the worms, because that children can hard∣ly vse Wormséede by reason of the bitternesse: and this conserue doth not onely expell worms, but letteth that none other can come to ingender. And if one haue suspition of Wormes, then it is aduised that it be giuen, for that it strengtheneth much the stomacke. For to make Conserue of Prunes. §. 31. TAke of the great Damaske prunes or other great horse Prunes which be some∣what sowrish, as many as you please, cut them open and plucke out the stones: then let them séeth in a pot, afterwards straine them through a strainer, and then let it séeth againe vnto a pap, this cooleth all heate and quencheth the thirst in A∣gues. If you will haue a laxatiue Conserue, then take sweet Prunes. There is also made at the Apothecaries a laxatiue conserue called Diaprunum solutiuum, which you are to séek in the Table. Some do take for the first described Prunes conserue of the one halfe of Sugar, whereby it is also pleasant, but it is in hot sicknesses much more commodious to be vsed with∣out Sugar. But if you will onely preserue Prunes, then take the foresaid Prunes of Damaske, and then powre as much clarified hony vpon it which is not too hot, stirring it alwaies well about. If it be seene that the Hony be waterish, then must it be decocted againe, like as it is oftentimes ad∣monished before.
How Quinces and other things are to be preserued. §. 32. OF these noble and odoriferous Quinces haue many ancient and also later Phi∣sitions written much, and vsed after sundry manners, whereby it is now come to passe, that there is scant any houshold of account where one findeth not al∣waies something prepared of Quinces, wherefore we will discourse somewhat ampler thereof, and first of all describe diuers confections. The Apothecaries do call the one Diacydonium simplex, for that there is none other but Sugar or Hony in it, and is thus made: Take Quinces as many as you please, whereof the kernels be put out, and cut them very small, afterwards séeth them in Well water to the end they may be soft, then straine them through a Strayner or Sieue, so that there re∣maine nothing but the parings in the Sieue. Then take thrée pound thereof, Sugar or Hony that is well clarified about foure pound, or as much as you please, then séeth them together vn∣to a conserue or confection, stirring it about continually. Another: Take cut Quinces which be cleansed from the séede, put them into a pot, and co∣uer it on the top with a pewter potlid, turne it afterwards about into another pot which is full of water, and let the same séeth, that the vapor may ascend, and the Quinces, through the va∣pour of the neathermost pot, may be mellow, that they may be afterwards driuen thorough a Sieue: take foure pound thereof, Sugar thrée pound, and let it séeth so together to a conserue. Some do take but halfe so much Sugar as Quinces, but therein may each one do his pleasure, how lesse Sugar that there is with it, so much the better be they for Phisicke. Other do boile or foment the Quinces with good old wine, which is also not to be reiected. This following is more forcible: Take as many Quinces as you will, grate them very small, and presse out the iuice, afterwards powre it vpon other sliced or cut Quinces, and then let them altogether séethe throughly with Sugar or Hony. This is an especiall medicine for to strengthen the stomacke, it stoppeth all scowring and wambling, it strengtheneth the inward weake parts, besides the digestiue and retentiue vertues, and it prouoketh appetite. But note this well, if one will stop the scowring, that one must take it before meate, and against the vomiting after meate. At the Apothecaries is prepared a Diacydonium compositum, or cum Speciebus, as hereafter fol∣loweth: Take thicke sodden iuice of Quinces, wherin is neither Sugar nor Hony, eightéene ounces, clarified Hony one pound and a halfe, séeth it méetely thicke. When it is now waxen luke warme, then temper these spices following (powned small) amongst it: to wit, Cinnamom three quarters of an ounce, Ginger halfe an ounce, Pepper and Galingall, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cloues and Nutmegs, of each one dragme and a halfe, Indy Spica, Lignum Aloes, Mace, and Cardamome, of each one dragme, Zeduarie halfe a dragme: afterwards powre it into boxes, and make a hole or twaine aboue on the top. It is also well aduised that one take Sugar in stead of hony. If you will haue a purging conserue of Quinces of Marmalade, then take of this foresaid conserue (whilst that it is yet warme) with the spices 22. ounces, and temper halfe an ounce of powned Diagridion amongst it, and stirre it very long, to the end it be well tempered. This fore∣said conserue of Quinces with the spices is more forcible for all the foresaid diseases, then the other, it causeth the winds to auoid, it expelleth all bad smels, it maketh a good colour, and it strengtheneth the naturall powers. For the kitchin and for housekéeping may this ensuing be prepared: pare as many Quinces as you please, grate them euen to the coare, and put all that is grated into a strong cloth, afterwards wring the iuice well out, and kéepe it in a pot. This being done, take other Quinces, pare them and cut them in foure péeces, put out the séede, and seeth the same in water vntill it be almost as mellow as pap, and all the water be consumed, but put out the seedes cleane, and put it in a pot apart, and powre water vpon it, then let it séeth well, and straine it through a cloth. Tye also a course cloth ouer an earthen pan, and lay thereon a good deale of mellow Quinces, and rub them through it, so that the best may go thorough, then take afterwards faire white Sugar, and powre theron some of the decoction of Quinces, let it seeth méetly hard, (then needeth not the conserue of Quinces to séeth so much) then take of this decoction of Quinces one part, and two parts of the other, and let it séeth vn∣til it be halfe thicke enough, afterwards put the Sugar vnto it, & then let it séeth thicke enough,
stirring it continually: when as it beginneth to be cold, then put into the boxes. And if this Marmalade be not faire enough, then take off the vppermost skin with a knife. It is also to be noted, that if it be not decocted drie enough, then can it not last aboue a yeare. Now for to make a cleare and perspicuous Marmalade: Take faire great Quinces, wash them very cleane, grate them very small, wring out as much iuice as you please: take after∣wardes other Quinces, cut them in sixe péeces, put them into a pot, let them be vapoured with hote water, like as we haue taught before, vntill that they be thorough mellow, then take half a pot full of the former iuice, and powre it vpon the former stewed and cut péeces, breake it well together, and then put the rest of the iuice amongst it, wring it thorough a thin cloth, vntill it be cleare: Of this iuice shall you not seeth more at once, than for to fill a boxe therewith, and put white Sugar vnto it (beaten very small) as much as you please. If the iuice be troubled, then let it passe once or twice thorough a cloth, or so long vntill it be thorough cleare: after∣wards séeth it spéedily away ouer a slight fire: when it is boyled enough, then powre it into the boxe, or wherein else you will, which might be made wet before: and when they haue stood one night, then may they be taken out. Note also here, that you must not take too little of the pap of the vapoured Quinces; for that the Marmalade should be very tough, and if one let the same séeth long, then would it be very browne. If you will make course Marmalade, then take the Quinces that remaine, whereof the best is strained out, and rubbe it thorough a hairen sieue, and afterwards put moe vapoured Quinces vnto it, and let it seeth away with Honie or Sugar. This serueth to dresse withall, or otherwise. A Marmalade not sodden: Take twentie or twentie fiue Quinces, pare them, and cut the halfe thereof in small péeces, the rest grate small, and presse the iuice well out: powre that vn∣to the cut péeces, and stew them vntill all be soft: afterwards wring them thorough a cloth, and stir as much powned Sugar amongst it, as you please, and then put them in a boxe, and so let it drie vpon an ouen. Item, take ripe Quinces which be not stony, pare them, and take out rdund péeces so déepe, till you come to the stones. You are to grate these Quinces, and to wring out the iuice, to the end that you may haue a good deale of it, then powre this iuice vpon the péeces that you cut out, and then let it séeth vntill it be thorough mellow: then put cleare decocted Sugar vnto it, as much as you please, and then drie them with a soft fire, then put them in the boxes, and let them drie well. Another: Take foure ounces of fresh Quince kernels, let them stéepe a day and a night in Well water, or in the iuice of Quinces, in a warme place, afterwards wring out the slime tho∣rough a cleane cloth, and then put thereto foure pound of the iuice of Quinces in a leaded pot, and let it séethe all together by a soft fire: yet it is to be strained then thorough a cloth a∣gaine, and afterwards also take two poundes of Sugar, and séethe it vntill it be thickt e∣nough. Yet another course Marmalade: Take of the pith whence the best iuice is wroong out, and put warme water vnto it, and séeth it well; then rub thereof thorough as much as you can, and put cleare Hony vnto it as much as you please, and then put some Pepper vnto it, and séeth it very thicke. If you will now know when these Marmalades be decocted enough, then let some fall vpon a cold Iron, and be cold, if it be enough, then will it easily part from the iron, and re∣maineth not hanging on the fingers, but it goeth cleane and drie off. All these sorts of Marmalades, or Conserues of Quinces are very good for the stomacke, and helpe the digestiue power. The same may moreouer be tempered in Malmsey, in Claret wine, and Hypocras, and may also be vsed in stead of a sauce with meate. It is also here to be noted, that all Marmalades, which are prepared with Wine, spices, and such like, are good onely for old folkes, and for cold women, and for all them which be cold by nature. Contrariwise, they that be prepared with water and iuice of Quinces, be méetely hot, because the fruite is cold in the first, and drie in the second degrée: wherefore they be méete for all people which be hote by nature, and for all them whose gall ouerfloweth much in the stomacke. Snow-white Marmalade is also to be made in this manner: Take pared Quinces, cut them, in foure or fiue péeces, and cut them out within: afterwards put hony vnto them, and let
them slew in a pot, vntill that they be mellow: then take them out, and let them be cold, and sticke them about with cut Cinnamom and Cloues, put Hony vnto it againe, and then set it so in a sellar, that it may remaine moist, and lay some heauie thing vpon it, that they swim not. Item, take Quinces as many as you please, prepare them as before, powre wine vnto it, but let them not be stewed too mellow, especially if one will kéepe them a certaine time: let them af∣terwards drie vpon a cloth: if you will sticke them about as before, that is wholly in your po∣wer: if not, bind in a cloth Cinnamom, Cloues, Mace, and lay it in the decoction: afterwards take one part of wine, and two parts of Honie, and let it séeth so long vntil that al the wine be wasted, then afterwards powre Hony vpon it, but not too hote, to the end that thereby they be not too hard. Before times, these were woont to be made in this manner following: Take a rough cloth, and rub off therewith the vttermost parings of the Quinces, or pare them very thin, and then cut them in foure peeces, and take out the coare within, afterwards powre vpon them two parts of wine, and one part of Hony which is clarified, then séeth them so long vntill the skin do wrinkle, then be they enough: put them out, and let them be cold, lay them in a potte, and strew some spice vpon each row; afterwards powre the decoction (sodden short) luke warme vpon it. Item, take Quinces, take out the coares, and lay them in a pot close one to another, and let them stand stewing in an ouen, vntill that they be mellow, so that they may easily be pricked thorough with bodkins; afterwards let them be cold, and then put them againe into another pot, and powre clarified Hony vpon it, lay some heauie thing vpon it, that they swim not about, then will they remaine good a whole yeare, and haue the same vertue of the common Marmalade. You haue also before in the description of Peares, how that they shall be made close in a pot, and should then be laid in a fat of Wine, you may also put the same in practise with the Quinces. Lay the Quinces all the winter in small chopt straw, and couer them well, but lay none o∣ther fruite with it, and kéepe them from the ayre. Other do take Flockes, some Bran, or Hay. But the very surest is if one will kéepe them the whole yeare, that they be couered in their own leaues, and afterwards couer them with Lome, let them drie, and set them somewhere in a cold drie place. There may also be made many kinds of things of Quinces, viz. the sirupe Miua, and oyle, and also the séedes thereof be vsed and the péeles. Conserue of Roses. §. 33. COnserue of Roses which is ready at al Apothecaries, and common in al houses is thus prepared: Take red Rose buds, which be pluckt in drie weather, as ma∣ny as you please. clip them off vnder the white with a paire of sheares, then lay them on a cleane cloth, and one double cloth ouer them, that they may be well couered, let them lye so still vpon a table two or three daies, that they may wi∣ther a little, and afterwards stamp them in a mortar to grout: and to one part of the powned Roses, take two parts of Sugar, and stampe them well together; afterwards put this Conserue in a glasse, and stop it close the space of thrée moneths in the sun; yet stirre them about once euery day, with a woodden spatine: if so be that you thinke that they will be too hard, then set them afterwards in a sellar, that they relent somewhat. It is here also to be noted, that if so be you cannot get the right red Roses, then take the Carnation coloured, yea also the wild Roses, of the which I haue found my selfe, that the Conserue it selfe is of very good tast, and moreouer very forcible in working. This Conserue of Roses hath an especial vertue to streng∣then a weake stomacke, and to allay all cholericke humors; it strengtheneth the braines, it quic∣keneth and strengtheneth the heart, it cooleth the heate, and all inflammation of the inward parts. This Conserue of Roses may well be tempered with Rosewater or Well water, and be wrung thorough a cloth, and so in all hote agues to comfort the sicke persons with it: it moiste∣neth also the drie toung, the throat, the breast, and the lights, and especially that which is new made: that which is oldish hath another nature of binding in all scourings and fluxes, it swa∣geth the paine and sharpnesse of the same, &c. The purging Conserue of Roses is made thus: Take twelue ounces of Sugar of Roses, and temper amongst it at the least half an ounce of small pouned Diagridion. This conserue of Roses
is also very good in sundrie sicknesses, and especially in lingering diseases. There is halfe an ounce thereof giuen, or at the most thrée quarters of an ounce at once, when as the Diagridion hath bene tempered amongst it at the least two moneths before. The white Conserue of Roses is made like to the red. Some do make all Conserues of Ro∣ses with Hony in stead of Sugar, but this Conserue is hotter, and is seldome vsed. There is also Conserues made of Damaske Roses, after the foresaid manner, which is very pleasant, and looseth mildly. Conserue of Rosemary. §. 34. THis Conserue is very pleasant, not onely for Phisicke, but the flowers and the herbe is also vsed in the Kitchin, with wine and otherwise. But as much as con∣cerneth the Conserue, the Apothecaries do call it Conserua Anthos, and is made thus: Take flowers of Rosemary which are to be gathered in the spring, and in haruest, powne them to pap, and to one part of these flowers, take three parts of Sugar, and powne it very well togther, then set it in the Sunne, stirring it oftentimes about. This Conserue is warme by nature, it attenuateth also all tough, grosse, and flegmatick mat∣ter of the inward parts, it drieth and strengtheneth the braines, it refresheth the heart, and ma∣keth it merrie; it strengtheneth the mortified naturall heate, it expelleth the yellow Iaundise, and withstandeth the Dropsie, it warmeth and cleanseth the breast, it maketh a good breath, it driueth out phlegme, and strengtheneth digestion, it withstandeth all venime that might hurt the heart, it taketh away the Chollicke or griping of the belly, it causeth one to sweate well, whereby it expelleth all bad humors out of the bodie, it cleanseth the bloud, hunteth away all heauinesse and pensiuenesse, and strengtheneth all weaknesse. To preserue the rootes of all red Beetes. §. 35. YOu are to stew these rootes with a little water, when they be mellow, then put thereto little péeces of Horsradish, and put them in a pot, and strew it with Ca∣raway: afterwards powre halfe wine and halfe vineger vpon it, vntill that they be well couered, and then lay some heauie thing vpon them, that they may not swim: in the same manner may you also prepare all the rootes that serue for Sallads: the rootes which are too great are to be cut ouerthwart. These and such like rootes are not to be vsed for phisicke, but for meate. Conserue of Sage. §. 36. COnserue of Sage is also made of the flowers, like vnto all other; it doth strengthen the stomack, it openeth all obstructions, it consumeth all bad humors of the stomacke, it strengtheneth all members, and is very good for all diseases of the head, which pro∣céede of cold, it is good against all Palsies and lamenesse, it is also méete for all disea∣ses of the sinewes. How Sloes are to be preserued. §. 37. TAke very ripe Sloes, with their stalks, and put thereto two parts of Hony, and one part of wine, and let them séeth so long vntill the wine be thoroughly sodden away; afterwards lay the Sloes in a pot, with the stalkes on high, and powre the same Hony vpon it, and couer it with a trencher, and lay some heauy thing on them, to the end that they may be couered with the liquor; and then set them in a sellar. Another way to preserue Sloes: take vnripe Medlars, ripe Sloes, ripe and pared Quinces, when the coares be cut out, of each as much as you please: if you will you may sticke them about with spice: likewise also the Medlars; which you shall séeth with the Quinces in Hony, like as is first of all said of Sloes, and lay some heauie thing on the top of it.
Conserues of Cowslips. §. 38. THere be two kinds of these flowers, whereof the one is wild, and without smell, which is méete for nothing: but take of the yellow that smels well, and cut thereof behind the long pipe, and with Sugar make a Conserue thereof. This Conserue is of a warme and drie nature, it is very good for the head, it strengtheneth and warmeth the braines it is also good for the Palsey, for which cause it is also called Herba paralysis. This conserue is also of all them (which be inclined to the Palsey) much vsed, and it strengtheneth also the heart: but it is perchance not much vsed, for that it is a kind of Betony or of Gillow∣flowers, which be more acceptable. Conserue of water Lillies. §. 39. LIkewise there be two sorts of these flowers, to wit, yellow and white, take there∣of the white, and the white leaues onely of the flowers, make a conserue thereof ike vnto all other conserues. This conserue strengtheneth much, and cooleth in very hote agues, and also in pestilentiall agues, It is also very good for them that consume away, and that haue the Pleurisie. It taketh away all drie coughes, for that it cooleth and moisteneth the breast, the throat, and the dry tongue: it quencheth thirst, it cooleth through her cold the Liuer, the Milt, and all inward parts, and it prouoketh sléepe. All haile people and they that be cold of nature may not vse the same, for that if the same be vsed too much, then taketh it away the fleshly desire, and it obstructeth also the spermaticall fluxe if it be heate. Conserue of Violets. §. 40. TAke blew odoriferous Violet flowers, plucke the flowers from their hu, and powne them to a pap. Vnto a pound of flowers put two pound of Sugar, and then stampe them well together, and so set them in the Sunne. This Conserue is cold in the first, and moist in the second degrée. It cooleth and moisteneth with mildnesse, and it asswageth also the paine of the guts, but it is not so good for the stomacke. It allayeth also the cholericke heate which co∣meth through moisture. It looseth and also taketh away thirst. It may well be giuen to young children (in all heate) very fréely, for that it is good against their pangs, it kéepeth the belly o∣pen, it strengtheneth the braines and the heart, and it taketh away all stitches. The yellow Violets are also preserued otherwhiles. Conserue of the flowers of Cicorie. §. 41. TAke the leaues of Cicorie flowers, and make a conserue thereof, like as is taught of all other. This conserue is especiall good for the Liuer, it openeth the obstruction of the same, it cleanseth all inward parts, and also the intrailes of all cholerick humors, it expelleth them out thorough the stoole, and withstandeth thereby all putrifying agues, therefore this conserue is also to be vsed in the beginning of the Dropsie, it reuiueth the weake and ouer-hea∣ted heart, and also the stomacke. In fine, it is very good in all hot sicknesses. The roots of Cicory are also preserued, which are digged vp before that they begin to sprout out. Being digged vp make them cleane, and cut them the long way, and then take the innermost hart of it. After∣wards cut it in péeces the length of a finger, and then let them boile well in fresh water, that the bitternes may come out, and the rootes may be mellow. When as they be meetly drie, then powre thicke boyled Sugar vpon it, and if the rootes be still somewhat hard, then let them boile in the Sugar vntill they be mellow, and let them be cold. But if that the sirupe be thin through the moisture of the rootes, then séeth the same thicke againe, and that so often vntill it remaine stiffe. These rootes be of a cold and dry nature, and they haue the same vertues with ye conserue.
How red Cherries are preserued. §. 42. REd Cherries be preserued like as we haue taught before of the blacke. They haue also one kind of operation, and are thus preserued: Take picked red Cher∣ries which be not brused, put them in a small Oaken vessell, afterwards take clarified Honie, and let it seeth with a little wine, vntill all the moisture be con∣sumed, and powre then this Honie warme vpon it, otherwise would they break through heate. This being now done, then stoppe the vessell tight, and lay it in a Sellar, and rowle it daily from one place to another, and do this the space of fourtéene daies, or thrée wéekes. There is also made of these Cherries a conserue, as hereafter followeth. Take Cherries as many as you please, stampe them a little, and then powre yet moe other Cherries vnto it, and boile it without any other moisture: all that which will remaine thicke, is to be rubbed thorough a sieue, to the end that there do not remaine any other thing in the sieue, than skinnes and stones; then séeth it in an earthen pot. You may also put Sugar vnto it, as much as you please, and then séeth it vnto a conserue. For this, is no kind of Spice méete, if so be that one desire not to put a little Cinnamom vnto it. This conserue is very good against all drith of the mouth, throat, and toung, if sicke persons be washed with it. It quencheth thirst in all hote Agues, and otherwise. It is also good for all Cholera of the stomacke, it maketh appetite to meate, and it cooleth the hote reynes: the kernels do expell grauell. In Summer time is wine to be mingled with this conserue, and to be vsed for sauce with rost meate. If one desire to kéepe Cherries long fresh, then are picked Cherries to be taken for it, and to dip the same in molten Waxe, viz. when it beginneth to be cold, & to let them be well closed in Waxe, and afterwards to sement the same with Lome vntill it be throughly closed, then are they to be hanged vp in a coole place, and they will remaine fresh a very long time. How ripe and vnripe Grapes are to be preserued. §. 43. THe vnripe Grapes shall be confected like to all Barberries, but you must cut euery berrie from the Cluster, to the end that they may kéepe their stalkes, and put therewith like as is said of the black Cherries: then let them not séeth long, that they do not breake and get a bad tast. They haue the same power as the Barberries. The ripe Grapes are to be confected, like as we haue written of Peares. Of that which commonly keepeth all fruites fresh. §. 44. AL that is laid in Honie, whether it be Flesh, Fruite, and Plants, or any other thing, doth remaine a long time before it spoile, therefore haue dead carkasses before time bene powred full of Honie. If you haue then any Fruite, Fowles, Venison, or any other such like things that you will kéepe good the space of a yeare; or any Plants, or Flowers, and such like throughout the winter, then looke into M. Tristrams water, whereof all auncient Phisitions haue had a good opinion. The same also do all vitall and golden waters, which follow immediatly hereafter.
The sixt Chapter. Of the golden and vitall waters, and Elixers of life. THese kinds of potions and artificiall waters, are ordained most to this end, for that they should strengthen the most principall parts of the bo∣die, as the head and the heart, to kéepe it from debilitie and swouning, especially if the same procéed of cold. Thus we will describe some of them, whereof there be two, which the auncient Phisitions call golden waters for their especiall vertues. Take fine Sage seuen ounces, Nut∣megs, Cloues, Ginger, and Greins, of each halfe an ounce, Cinnamom, péeled Bayberries, and Beuercod, of each one ounce, Spikenard one dragme, péeles of Citrons one quarter of an ounce, temper them all together grossely beaten, then powre two quarts of wine vpon it, and so let al together stand the space of fourtéene daies stopped close, stirring it well about euery day. Afterward distill it in water in an Helme luted well and tight. This water doth kéepe all manner of meates by their naturall tast and vertue, it expelleth all bad humors of the bodie, it maketh all wine cleane and of a good tast, if one tem∣per a little amongst it, annoynted outwardly vpon one, or vsed. It is very good for all inward parts, as the Stomack, the Spléene, the Lyuer, and the Lights. It is also good for all bruses, and to annoint the bruses with it. In like manner it is good for all falles, for all byles, and all paines of the head. It is good (namely at the first) against all Dropsies, against the Palsey, and also against all venime. If one haue any thing in the stomacke that he cannot digest, then will it be consumed thereby, it maketh a good memorie, and withstandeth the Leprosie, it healeth all scabbines, and also all vlcers, if one drinke it, or lay it vpon them. Another. Take Lauander flowers, Hyssope and Sage, of each foure ounces, cut them very small, Nutmegs, Ginger, Cinnamom, and Cloues, of each halfe an ounce, Greines two drag. beate all small, afterwards powre vpon it thrée quarts of the best wine, and set it the space of fourtéene daies in the Sunne stopped very close. Thus may you vse the first. Item, take good Malmsey two quarts, and stéepe these things ensuing in it, being stopt very close, and then set it in a dunghill which lyeth in the East the space of thirty daies, afterwards distill it, as is be∣fore said. Take fine Sage with the flowers, of each halfe an ounce, Burrage flowers one ounce, one Orange, Rue thrée dragmes, Rosemarie thrée ounces and a halfe, Rosemarie flowers half an ounce, the toppes of Marioram gentle foure ounces, the flowers of Buglosse thrée quarters of an ounce, red Roses two ounces and one quarter, Hyssope halfe an ounce, Carduus Benedi∣ctus halfe an ounce, Ireos thrée dragmes, Camfere thrée quarters of an ounce, prepared Perls halfe a dragme, oyle of Spike and liquide Storax, of each halfe a dragme, powned Cinnamom foure ounces, Galingall thrée dragmes, long Pepper and Greines, of each halfe an ounce, Cu∣cubes, and Cardamome, of each one ounce and a quarter, Zeduarie thrée dragmes, Ginger one ounce, beate this all together grosse. Here is to be noted, that there will be too little wine, and that fréely there may thrée or foure quarts of wine be taken for it. Now followeth here a water, called the elixer of life, and is thus made. Take Cinnamom and Cloues, of each one ounce and a halfe, Nutmegs one ounce, red Ro∣ses ten handfuls, white Roses as many, Hyssope two handfuls, Lauander flowers seuen hand∣fuls, powre vnto it a quart of Malmsey, and so let it stand the space of nine daies, and distill it afterwards, as is said before. Now for to distill a common vitall water is thus to be done. Take Cinnamom one ounce and a halfe, Ginger one ounce, Cloues, Nutmegs, and Greines, of each halfe an ounce, Lignum Aloes, Mastick, Mace, and long Pepper, of each two dragmes, Sage sixtéene ounces, Cardamome, Cucubes, and Galingall, of each two dragms and a halfe, Roses one quarter of an ounce, Balme thrée dragmes, Citron péels thrée quarters of an ounce, Rue, Bayberries, and Stechas, of each halfe an ounce, Rosemarie, Marioram, Lauander, and Betony, of each thrée quarters of an ounce, Spica, and Beuercod, of each one dragme, stéep it in thrée quarts of Malmsey, and so let it stand the space of ten daies, then distill it like as is taught of the other. Some haue also an especiall water, which is called Aqua spiritualis, for that it
strengtheneth much the vitall spirits: Take the herb Lauander with the flowers, and Liricon∣fancie, of each two ounces, Rosemary flowers, and Betonie, of each thrée dragmes, Sage, and Marioram gentle, of each one ounce, Balme halfe an ounce, Hyssope, Mints, the greater Pim∣pernell, Tormentill, Rapontica, Angelica, and Bistorta, of each one quarter of an ounce, Piony rootes, and of Valerian, of each one dragme Auence, and Iuniper berries, of each half an ounce, Bayberries, and Beuercod, of each one drag. cut the rootes, and powne them grosly. The herbs are you to take drie, and to cut them small, and then put them in a glasse which is narrow a∣boue, afterwards powre fiue pints of ye spirit of wine vpon it, and stop it tight, then set it the space of eight dayes in the Sunne, or in another warme place, and distill it afterwards, as is said in the beginning. In all that which is distilled out are you to lay in steepe, Ginger and Ga∣lingall, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cloues halfe an ounce, Cucubes one quarter of an ounce, Cardamome and Nutmegs. of each halfe a dragme, Greines one scruple, Citron peeles one quarter of an ounce, Pomegranate péeles halfe a dragme, Lignum Aloes and white Mustard séede, of each one scruple, Saffron halfe a dragme, Indie Spica one scruple, Annis halfe an ounce, Fennell one quarter of an ounce, Treacle one ounce, Turpentine thrée dragmes, prepa∣red red Corall one dragme, Manus Christi with Pearls halfe an ounce, conserue of Roses one ounce, clarified Hony foure ounces, then powne it all grosse that is to be powned, and so let it stand the space of foure daies in a warme place, afterwards you shall distill it, and then temper amongst it Muscus and Ambra, of each one scruple, Spermaceti one drag. good Rubarbe one quar∣ter of an ounce, Camfer ten greines, Sugarcandy one ounce, then wring it out oftentimes, and kéepe it stopt close. Another. Take drie red Rose leaues halfe an ounce, flowers of Sage, of Rosemary, of Bur∣rage and Buglosse, of each one quarter of an ounce, Liriconfansy one ounce & a halfe, Balme, Citron péeles, Betonie, and red Gilloflowers, of each one ounce, Nutmegs & Mace, of each one drag. Cardamome & Cucubes, of each half a drag. white & yellow Saunders, of each one quarter of an ounce, powne all these things very small, then take a pint of good spirit of wine, and put therein 2. ounces of Cucubes, the stones taken out, & then cast them to the foresaid small beaten herbs, and let them all stand to steepe in a warme place, vntill that the wine hath drawne the vertue of these herbes vnto it, the which wil be done in the space of two moneths. You may also set it in the Sun all the whole Sommer, straine it at last thorough a fine cloth. You may also put vnto this Muske, pretious stones, Amber, Perls, Vnicornes horne, and such like things, for to strengthen the same therewith. These foresaid vitall waters be especially good against all swouning, against all debilitie of the braines and of the heart, they strengthen also the sinewes, & the memorie, they warme the chilled and bad digesting stomack, wherin is much slime, if they be taken fasting. If one perceiue any losse of his memorie, then is he to annoint therewith the forehead, the hinder part of the head, and the temples of the same. They be also good against all lamenes of the Palsy: they be also good against trembling & shaking, against swimming in the head, and such like diseases. But note, that here will be too little burnt wine, but one may take more. In like manner, you haue also in the 1. part the twelfth Chap. and 5. §. a very good water of May Lillies. This following is also an elixer of life, and is thus prepared: Take Rose∣water 4. ounces, water of Burrage and of Buglosse, of each 3. ounces, Manus Christi 1. ounce, and a halfe, prepared Pearles one drag. and a halfe, temper them all together, and so giue it him that hath great heate of the head and of the Liuer, and where as is great faintnesse of the heart. This vitall water ensuing is very common at Augusta in Germany. Take culled Cinnamom thrée quarters of an ounce, Ginger halfe an ounce, Cloues, Nut∣megs, and Greines, of each one quarter of an ounce, Mace, Lignum Aloes, and long Pepper, of each one drag. Cardamome, Masticke, Cucubes, Galingall, and Calmus, of each halfe a dragm, Balme flowers sixe ounces, Citron péeles thrée dragmes, péeled Bayberries and Stechas, of each one quarter of an ounce, Rue, Rosemarie, Marioram, Lauander, Balme, and Betony, of each halfe a handfull, Indy Spica, and Beuercod of each halfe a drag. steepe them all together in two quarts of Muscadel, or in any other strong wine, and let it stand so 10. or 12. hours space. Afterwards distill it in seething water, then are you to hang Muske and Amber, of each fiftéene graines, to wit, in a fine cloth, and then kéepe it close stopt. This following is a very odoriferous water to be vsed for what one will: Take the flowers of Spike, and Lauander flowers, of each one handfull, Cloues, Cinnamom, Nutmegs, Mace,
of each one dragme and a halfe, Muske the quantitie of a pease, then powre vnto it thrée pints of Rosewater and so set it in the Sunne. There is yet another odoriferous water in the sixt part, in the fiftéene chap. and 5. §. which may also be vsed for diuers purposes. Cinnamom water is also exhibited to sicke folkes for a strengthening, and they are annoin∣ted therwith, and is to be further vsed for many Confections, Marchpanes, and other pleasan∣ties, the which is thus to be made: Take foure ounces of good Cinnamome, pown it very smal and put it into an helme, afterwards powre a pint of water vpon it and lute it close: then distill it in seething water, and that which commeth out first is whitish, and strongest, and is onely to be kept, and the rest to be receiued in another glasse. The 7. Chapter. Of Hand waters. TAke Lauander or Spikenard where out the water is before distilled, and powre as much raine water vnto it vnill the helme be more than halfe full afterwards distill it in seething water and set it in the sunne, it smelleth strong enough and it remaineth good certaine moneths. For to make May cheese. §. 1. TAke a new earthen pot wash it well with hote water & rub it with Salt within, afterwards make a hole in the bottome and put in a small tap: then take fresh milked milke and rennet it like as a Chéese is wont to be rennetted, and so let it stand from morning to euening: then plucke out the tap that the whay may runne out: afterwards put euery day a saucerfull of new milke with it, accor∣ding to that there is much or little in the pot: stirre it well about, and then let e∣uery euening the whay run out: besides al this, you are to salt the milk a litle in rennetting of it. How to make wafers of Sugar. §. 2. WHat the Wafers be (which are woont to be set vpon the table a nights) is well knowne to all men, thus for to confect them and to make them onely of Sugar, is to be done: Take faire white Sugar powned very small and sifted tho∣rough a fine sieue, make past thereof with Dragagant dissolued in Rosewater; the which is to be stamped in a mortar, to the end you may make thereof thin flat wafers: this being done, then is the same beneath and aboue to be bestrewed with well powned Sugar that it cleaue not too, then wind them on a round stick & lay them v∣pon a sieue to drie, to wit, in a warme place, but not in ye sun: if you will you may also put Mus∣cus vnto it. In like maner you may take for it powned Sugar, & Cinnamom tempered together & roule the same also vpon a round staffe with dissolued Dragagant the which being bound to the space of fourtéene dayes may remaine good, and they are made like Cinnamom pipes. Hony water, Hydromel. §. 3. HOny water or our course Meade do the Grecians cal Hydromel, and the Latinists Aquam mulsam; this water is to be vsed for many things, and especially in Phi∣sicke for two kinds of things: the first, if one will loose the belly or procure vomit, then temper the same with two parts of old raine water, and one part of Hony, and so let it stand in the Sunne. This Hony water is to be tempered with oyle if the cause require it, and being lukewarme vsed for vomiting: the other Hony water is to be sodden and vsed also for many kinds of things, as we in this booke haue in many places declared.
The eighth Chapter. For to make Iuleps IVleps are made after diuers manners, and most of all of distilled waters, but the commonest and most knowne are to be boiled of Rosewater, and Violet water with Sugar, as both these in the third part, the 12. Chapter, and 10. §. be described: both these Iuleps be very much vsed in hote and drie causes. The ninth Chapter. For to take spots out of all Clothes. FOr to take spots out of all clothes, take two parts of Béechen ashes, and one part of Lime, and make Ley thereof with raine water, filter it often∣times, and therewith wash the Spots. Item, take Argall one handfull, thrée Oxe gals, Venice sope two ounces, Allume halfe an ounce, and a pint and a halfe of water: séeth it all together vntill that the fourth part be wasted, and then wash the spots therewith. But aboue all should di∣stilled water of Toadstooles be very good to take all spots out of clothes, they may trie that will. For to take the spots out of Chamlet and silkes, rub it out with Turpentine oyle. Spice cakes which be excellent good. §. 1. OF fine Hony take a quart, clarifie it well, and halfe a pint of Malmsey, Cloues two ounces and a halfe, Ginger two ounces, Nutmegs one ounce, fine meale or flower fiue pound: let the Hony and Malmsey séeth together, then knead the Meale in it and make Cakes of it as you desire to haue them, then bake them in an Ouen. The tenth Chapter. Here after follow Confections. HEre shall follow now all kind of purging confections which are commended to be vsed in this booke, to the end that not onely the bare vnknowne name, but also their vertues and operations might be declared: therefore we will comprehend them in a short sum, and vse the names that are best knowne at the Apothecaries; and besides that we will interpret and english their names the best we can. Confectio Anacardina. §. 1. FIrst of all we will speake of the Anacardina. This confection doth sharpen the vnder∣standing and the memorie, and is also good against all paine of the stomacke which cometh through cold, it cleanseth the bloud, and maketh good colour: it is also called a confection of the Sage men. Antidotum Haemagogum. §. 2. THis Confection hath her name of the bloud wherein it doth also raigne: the which also the Gréeke name doth giue to vnderstand.
Electuarium de Baccis Lauri. §. 3. This is a confection of Bayberries; this confection is for the griping and paine of the belly which is caused of wind, the vbest medicine that may be deuised, and moreouer against all inward maladies which procéed of cold. Benedicta laxatiua. §. 4. THis confection is called a blessed Laxatiue, it is very much vsed and found readie at all Apothecaries: it is made of many simples, wherefore we omit her description: it is very good to purge all tough slimie matter, and especially that which lieth in the ioynts, as in them which haue the ioynt disease or the gout, it cleanseth much, and purgeth also slimie mat∣ter of the kidneys, and of the bladder, &c. Bezoarctica. §. 5. SUch like Confections there are very many prepared in time of the plague for to prouoke sweate; of which we haue described one in the sixt part, the 16. chap. §. 3. Electuarium de Calamintha. §. 6. A Confection of the field Mints is described after thrée waies by the Phisitions; and when we make it, which happeneth seldome, it is in forme of Tabulates: but that which Galenus describeth, is made as followeth: Take the séedes of field Mints, of Penniroyall, of Parsly, and Siluermountaine, of each one dragme, the séedes of Smallage, and of Thyme, of each one quarter of an ounce: the séede of Louage one ounce, Pepper thrée ounces: make thereof Spe∣cies. You are to take Sugar according as you will make a confection or tabulates, and that in such quantitie as thereto belongeth. This confection is very good for all them that haue a wam∣bling of their meate, for them that haue a bad breath, and a bad stomacke, and be much plagued with the wind of the stomacke. Confection of Cassie after three waies. §. 7. HOw highly that the Cassie is commended in Phisicke, and especially in hote sicknesses is discouered in many places of this booke, and especially in the In∣troduction, where it is also taught how the same is to be driuen through a sieue. Secondly, there is a confection made thereof, to wit, Diacassia cum Manna, which is to be vsed against the binding of the belly. The third is here before in the third Chapter described, in the first §. where we did discourse of Clisters, and in other places moe. Electuarium de Castoreo. §. 8. THis is the Confection of Beuercod which one findeth very seldome, vnlesse it were prepa∣red of purpose for any body. Catharticum Imperiale. §. 9. THis is as much to say, as an imperiall purgation, for that especially it is a purger of the head, maketh swéet breath, and expelleth blacke melancholy, and gall out of the stomacke: this confection is not common at all Apothecaries. Catholicon. §. 10. THis Gréeke name is as much to say, as vniuersall, and the ancient Phisitions haue giuen that name vnto this Confection, for that it is meete for all diseases: therefore it is also
kept prepared at all Apothecaries. And because that the same can be made by no housholder, therefore we will not set downe her description. It is not onely good for all strong diseases, but also for all the extreamest sicknesses, it allayeth and altereth the same, it strengtheneth al them that haue any infirmitie of the Lyuer, or in the Spléene; it purgeth melancholick, cholerick, and phlegmaticke humors, and is a safe medicine; as it is also vsed in many places of this booke. Electuarium de Cincribus §. 11. THis Confection of Ashes is hardly to be found readie at any Apothecaries, but by reason of her profitablenesse, to shew that the ancient Phisitions haue not pretermitted to make it knowne, therefore it is described in the third part, and hath an especiall vertue in ex∣pelling of the stone, and of the grauell. Electuaria varia de Citonijs. §. 12. THere be sundrie Conserues of Quinces, or of Marmalade, like as you find them before in the fourth Chapter, and 32. §. Electuarium de Corticibus Aurantiarum. §. 13. THe preserued péeles of Oranges, doth one find readie all Apothecaries, and are good for all paines of the stomacke. Electuarium Ducis. §. 14. THis Confection was prepared for a Duke, and is compounded of many things together: wherefore we will not describe the same here, for it is found commonly at all well furni∣shed Apothecaries: it is also very good for all windy and bad digesting stomackes, and a∣gainst all cold of the inward parts: it is also good against all griping of the belly, and especially for the stone: for which cause it is principally ordained in this our booke of phisicke. Electuarium de Epythymo. §. 15. THis Confection is very seldome vsed, but the flowers and the Thymus is very common in Phisicke. This Confection should be very necessarie, and helping women vnto fruitfulnes, like as is also prescribed in this booke for the same. Electuarium de Gallia. §. 16. THis for the profitablenes and commoditie that it hath in the paine of the guts, and in Phle∣gma, and for that it is easie to be made, is described in the third part, the 15. Chapter, and 6. §. for it is not knowne at the Apothecaries. Confectio Hamech. §. 17. THis Confection is of two sorts, and is compounded of many things, and is very common at all Apothecaries: wherwith the humors of the Gall, especially the salt humors which cause scabbines, the Leprosie, the Canker, and all other diseases which excoriate and inflame the skin by their sharpnesse are holpen. The lesser Confection Hamech, purgeth Melancholy, and is also good against all frenzie, giddinesse, forgetfulnesse, and all infections of the skin. Hiera Picra simplex. §. 18. THis Confection is at all Apothecaries euery where prepared, and is not onely very well knowne to the Phisitions, but also to the common people: Take Cinnamom, Balsam
wood, Asarabacca, Spica Indica, Saffron and Masticke, of each one dragme and a halfe, Aloe 25. drag. clarified and scummed Honie thirtéene ounces; make a Confection thereof. But if you will haue it to strengthen rather than to purge, then take washed Aloes, in stead of other. This Confection is very good against all rotting and stinking humors, which do kéepe themselues in the mouth of the stomacke, and in the bowels. In like manner it is also good for all them that haue lost their naturall colour, and against all inward diseases of the sight; it looseth very mildly and her operation penetrateth no further, but into the Liuer, it strengtheneth the stomacke, ne∣uertheles that it is partly hurtfull for them that haue a hote Liuer, but because of her great ver∣tue, it is much vsed. Hieralogodion. §. 19. THis Confection is also found at all Apothecaries, the which is made out of many sundry things, wherefore we will not describe the same here: it is good against all old madnesse, against all Melancholy, against all Falling sicknesse, and all other ragings or madnesse, against the giddinesse, and all paine of the head. Item, it is very good against all Palseys, against all shaking, and against all heart beating. It is also good in the Pleurisie, in all sicknesses of the Liuer and of the Spléene, it prouoketh wo∣mens termes; and is also good against all Gouts, against all poyson, Leprosie, and scurfe. Of this Confection may one take a dragme at once with Wine, if there be tempered a little salt with it. Hiera Pachij Ruffini. §. 20. THe first Hiera is now of late come againe in vse amongst the Phisitions, it is maruellous good for many kinds of things, not vnlike to the aforementioned. In this our booke of Phisicke is otherwhiles mention made of it. Electuarium Indum. §. 21. OF this Confection there be two sorts, a greater, and a lesser; yet both do expell bad hu∣mors, especially such as bréede wind in the stomacke, and other nutritiue parts, they amend also the bad accidents which arise thereby, as swelling vp of the stomacke, the griping of the belly, paine of the kidneys, and such like. Electuarium Lenitiuum. §. 22. THis is a laxatiue Confection, which expelleth gently, without any paine, the phlegmatick, cholericke, and melancholick humors. It is also good against all Agues, and it is found rea∣die at all Apothecaries, howbeit that it is very seldome vsed in this our booke of Phisicke. Electuarium de Lepore combusto. §. 23. THere is also a Confection prepared of the burnt Hares head, which is maruellous good a∣gainst grauell, and is described in the third part, the twelfth Chapter, and 4. §. Laetificans Almansoris. §. 24. THis pleasant Confection is now adaies made rather in Losinges, than in forme of a Confe∣ction: but how the Species be made, that do you find described in the first part, the twelfth Chapter and 8. §. Electuarium de Manna. §. 25. THis Electuarie of Manna, is a very noble Confection, wherein come many easie laxatiue things, it cleanseth the bloud, withstandeth Cholera, and Melancholia; it is very good for a hote liuer, and cleanseth also the body.
Electuarium ad Melancholiam. §. 26. THis Confection is not made, if it were not that it is especially ordained, and it is also but once vsed in this booke. Michleta. §. 27. THis Confection Michleta is prepared at all furnished Apothecaries: it is especiall good against all superfluous bléeding of the Piles, and against the griping of the belly, and it is exceeding good in all laskes, as in Lyenteria and Dysenteria. It is also vsed in Diarrhaea. Mithridatium. §. 28. THis high renowned and very wel knowne confection, hath next to Treacle the highest commendation and price aboue all other confections and compounded medicines, the which of very many and diuers simples is composed together: wherefore we wil pretermit her description here. It is also older than the Trea∣le & was found out by Mithridates king of Pontus thrée hundred yeares before Christs birth, and so named after him. This foresaid Confection did the King vse against all venime, and with such commoditie, that when he was in greatest extremitie and had taken poyson, he could not die of it. Wherefore and because that the same is oftentimes or∣dained in this booke, therefore we will briefly rehearse her vertue and vigor. First, it hath al∣most in al things the same power of the Treacle; but that only the Treacle is somwhat hotter & more forcible against all venim of snakes: otherwise it is good against all paine of ye head which proceedeth out of cold, and chiefly against all melancholicke diseases, and also for them that liue in great heauines without cause. It is also good against all heauie fansies and madnesse: and further it is also good against the Falling sicknes, against the giddinesse, and all old paine of the head. Likewise it is a very good medicine against all running and diseased eyes, it sharpeneth the sight, and it is good against all sissing of the eares, and against all paine and falling of the gums if the same be laid vpon it. Besides that, it is much commended for the squinancie, it cleanseth and healeth all vlcers of the throat. It is a speciall medicine for al them that be taken with the palsey, and them that haue a disease in the lights: as it is also for all them that cough much, spet bloud and complaine of pursiuenes. It is also especiall good for all cold and moist sto∣mackes, it maketh appetite, it strengtheneth the digestiue vertue, and maketh a good colour. It asswageth all gripings, all scourings, and the bloudie flixe it openeth the obstruction of the li∣uer and the milt: and it is a medicine for all inward parts, it driueth also the crampe away, and all conuulsions of the sinewes, it expelleth the grauell, and the stone of the bladder, it swageth all paine and vlcers of the same, it expelleth water, and moneth womens termes: it is very ne∣cessarie for al maladies of the Matrix, it is also especially commodious for all them that be pla∣gued with the gout in the hands and feet; but especially it is giuen against all poyson: this doth it not onely taken inwardly, but also laid vpon the outside. In like manner doth it apparantly worke in the tertian and quartaine Ague, if that the same be taken an hower before or ere the ague cometh, with wine. The common waight that one taketh thereof is a dragme: the which neuerthelesse according to the abilitie of the person and of the sicknesse, may be augmented or diminished, or also omitted all together. Electuarium Oculistae. §. 29. THis is a Confection for the eyes, whereof you shall find two sorts in the first part, the 7. chap. and 20. §. Electuarium de Olibano. §. 30. THis present Confection of Frankinsence is seldome vsed and prepared, but it is good a∣gainst all paine and rheumes of the head, and also of the eyes, it swageth all bad throates
which proceede of defluxions, it is also auaileable against the Cough and spitting of bloud, it stayeth all wambling and vomiting. Further, it is also good for all diseases of the Lights, and for the pleurisie, whereas the matter is coughed vp; it stayeth the running of the Raynes, and womens termes, it is also vsed against the scouring. Electuarium de Ouo. §. 31. HOw that this precious Confection of the golden Egge is to be made, is after two waies described in the sixt part, the 16. Chapter, and 3. §. and also taught thereby, how that all haile and sicke folkes ought to vse the same. Electuarium Diaphoenicon. §. 32. THis Confection of Dates is also to be made in Tabulates. It is méetly strong for to purge therewith in the Quotidian and Tertian agues. It purgeth Phlegma and Cholera. It hath a maruellous efficacie against all paine of the stomacke, and other like paines of the guttes, which are caused through any rough slimie humor, therefore it is also oftentimes prescribed in this booke. Philonium. §. 33. THis confection is also called according to them which haue found it out, to wit, after Phi∣lon. It is made after sundry manners, whereof there be twaine, which be accompted the chiefe, viz. Romanum and Persicum. The first is good against the Cough, and against all diseases of the Lights, viz. heauie breath, spitting bloud, distemperance of the stomacke, paine of the Lyuer, of the Spléene, and against all infirmities of the priuities, and of the bladder. The other, to wit, Persicon, is very good to staunch bloud, like as womens termes, or when the Pyles runne too sore: also in all scourings and bloudie fluxe, and whereas bloud is auoided then is it an especiall medicine. It is also excéeding good for women which haue first conceaued for to preserue and kéepe the fruite. Electuarium Diaprunis. §. 34. HEre before in the fourth Chapter, in the description of the preserued Prunes, is expressed of her power, and how it is made. Electuarium de Psyllio. §. 35. THis is also one of the commonest confections, which one findeth ready at all Apothecaries, it expelleth the cholerick matter, and is very good for all hote Agues, which otherwise are hardly to be expelled. Moreouer, it is good against the giddines and all paine of the head, which is caused by the vapors of Cholera, and mixed with other humors. Item, for the falling sicknes, and for enflaming of the Lyuer, &c. Electuarium de Raphano Syluestri. §. 36. HOw this is to be prepared, and of what power it is, that is to be séene in the third part, the 17. Chapter, and 4. §. Electuarium Regium. §. 37. ALbeit that it is called a kingly confection, and is very good, yet it is neuerthelesse no where in this booke vsed, but onely in the spetting of bloud.
Electuarium de succo Rosarum. §. 38. THis present Confection named, of the iuice of Roses, is one of the chiefest purging con∣fections, and because that it is very easie to be made, therefore we will describe it here. Take the iuice of red Roses and white Sugar, of each eight ounces, Diagridij three quar∣ters of an ounce, red, white, and yellow Saunders, of each three dragmes, burnt Iuorie one dragme and a halfe, Camfer halfe a scruple: the iuice and Sugar is to be sodden vnto a meete thicknesse, and when it is almost cold, then temper the rest amongst it, being all beaten very small. This may also well be made after the forme of losinges. This Confection purgeth Cho∣lera without any anguish, and it is also good for all paine of the members, which be caused through hote cholerick rheumes, also for the tertian Ague, and for other moe such like hote ac∣cidents. Diasatyrion. §. 39. THis is a Confection of Ragwoort rootes: how the same is prepared and vsed for the in∣crease of humane nature, you may reade in the third part, the sixt Chapter and 4. §. Electuarium de Scoria Ferri. §. 40. THe Confection of the refuse of Iron doth Rasis describe. It is seldome made or vsed. It stop∣peth the Fluxe and all bloud. Electuarium de Sebesten. §. 41. THis is also a very vsuall confection, how that the same is to be prepared, and what it hath for an operation or power, you may reade that in the third part, the eleuenth Chapter, and twentieth §. Dia Sena. §. 42. THis Confection of Sene, is also very common at all Apothecaries. It is good vsed in all melancholicke, franticke, pensiue, and such like sicknesses, which proceed of melancholicke bloud: and it cureth them that complaine of the Spleene. Theriaca magna. §. 43. THe occasion wherefore that this high commended Confection is not here described, is, for that it is made of so many things. Also because there is a contention as yet amongst the learned, then for that certaine things (which must be vsed in it) be not to be gotten, and especially in this Countrey, as the flesh of the Snake Tyrus, whereof this Treacle hath the name: but it is neuerthelesse needfull and well worthie that we here describe her operation and vigour. This Treacle and the Mithridate, be amongst all other confections the most renowned and worthiest. The first, was by Andromacho Neroes Phisition found out first, but afterwards by Galen brought into a better order, and in such manner amended, that it may very well be kept for so precious a Iewell, which is neither with gold nor siluer to be compared: thus for to speak of her vertue. First, it is good against all poyson, whether it be of beasts or otherwise, for to the same end it is giuen: and it is laid vpon the biting of mad Dogges. In like manner, it hath an especiall power against all bad ayre, against the Plague, and all pestilentiall Agues. It is also good against all old paines of the head, against the falling sicknesse, the giddinesse, and all dark∣nesse of the eyes. Item, it is commended for all infirmities of hearing, and for losse of sent. And briefly to speake thereof, it doth also amend all debilities, the infirmities of the mind, and also of the braine. Moreouer, it strengtheneth also all weaknesse and swounings of the heart, it openeth all obstructions of the Lyuer, and of the Spleene, and mollifieth or suppleth all their
hardnesse, it openeth the breast, and is good against the wheasing, and also against the short breath. It allayeth the cough, and suppleth all rawnesse of the throate, it doth prouoke the tough humors to be coughed vp, it withstandeth spetting of bloud, and swelling vp of the veins. It expelleth the yellow Cholera and the Dropsie, it healeth all inward diseases and vlcers, it asswageth all inward diseases where there is no heate nor ague instant, if the same be taken with Wine, or otherwise the same must be taken with some other distilled water. Likewise it is also good for all bad stomackes, it easeth the Consumption, it expelleth Wormes, and all windinesse of the guts: also it is good against all gripings and paine of the guts, it is also very fit for all diseases of the Rayns, it is very commodious and helping to all them which be vexed with the grauell or the stone, for that it expelleth the same, it healeth all vlcers of the bladder, and all conduits of vrine, it expelleth vrine and womens termes; in like manner also dead chil∣dren out of their mothers bodies. To all melancholicke, which be full of anguish and pensiue∣nesse without cause, and halfe distract of their wits, is this giuen with great aduancement. In fine, it is very good for all lingring sicknesses, as the Leprosie, old Agues, and chiefly Quartain Agues. Wherefore it is aduised to such as are to trauell in the cold, that euery morning fa∣sting they should take somewhat thereof, for that it warmeth the inward parts, and defendeth them from all cold. It strengtheneth also the lame members, and bringeth them againe to their power, and when the greatest paine of the Gout is past, then is it taken with great aduantage so that it preserueth the bodie from all corruption. But here is especially to be noted, that this Treacle is not good for young people, especially in Sommer time, or when it is hote weather, if so be that great néed do not require, and then shall not aboue halfe a dragme be giuen at once, for that it is too strong for such young natures. All they that be of middle age it is good for, vsed oftentimes, so that it cannot here be told, how much thereof may be giuen at once. The commonest waight is a dragme, and if so be that néed require not the same, then is seldome any more to be giuen: yet according to the importance and abilitie of the person, the sicknesse, and such like, is the same to be augmented or diminished with wine, or any other water. Theriaca Diatessaron. §. 44. THis Confection hath her name of the Grecians, for that it is made of foure kinds of things, namely in this manner following: Take Gentian, fresh Bayberries, Myrrha, and the right Hartwoort, of each two ounces, stampe all together very small, with one pound and a halfe of wel scummed Hony, then kéepe it well where you please. This Treacle may the common people commodiously vse in stead of the great Treacle, for that it withstandeth all pestilentiall Agues, and all venime, therefore do the people of the countrie also giue it to sicke Cattell, and that with very great aduantage. It is also good against all diseases of the braines, of the sinewes, and all sicknesses, which procéede of cold, as Falling sicknesses, Palsey, lamenesse, and the Crampe, it strengtheneth the sto∣macke and her digestiue power, it openeth the Liuer, the Spléene, and the Kidneys, therefore it is also good for the yellow Iaundise, the Dropsie, it expelleth windinesse, and all paine of the guts. There may one dragme or one dragme and a halfe be taken thereof, to wit, in the mor∣ning fasting, but Cattell must take more of it. Triphera. §. 45. OF such like Confections are many kinds described of the Phisitions, like as we shall shew hereafter. The first is Foenonis, and is the lesser. It is good for all excessiue fluxes, for womens termes, for the bléeding of the pyles, and against all debilitie of the sto∣macke, it causeth all grosse and tough humors to auoid, it amendeth the naturall colour, it strengtheneth the bladder, and stayeth the scourings. The other is Triphera magna, that is the greater. The same is vsed for all cold paine of the stomacke, as soone as one hath taken thereof, then sweate doth breake out vpon one. It is good for all melancholick women which cannot sléepe, and they that haue gotten this anguish and vexation through any disease of the Matrix. Likewise also for those which be burthened
with any slimie matter in the Lights, and for all them that spet bloud, whether it be beneath or aboue; and if that one leaue out the Opium, then should the same be good for to aduance the fruit∣fulnesse of women. The third is, Triphera Persica, which is made of many kinds of things, it is good against all agues, which procéede out of the stomacke, and also against the yellow Iaundise, which procée∣deth of great heate, it openeth all obstructions, it amendeth the sight which is infirmed through cholericke vapors, it quencheth thirst, and defendeth one from all hote sicknesses. The fourth is Triphera Saracenica, which with her heate strengtheneth the digestion of the stomacke and of the Liuer, it consumeth all windinesse of the same, it maketh a good breath, and is very commodious for the whole bodie; it kéepeth a bodie healthie, it prouoketh desire of ve∣nerie, and it obstructeth all the bleeding of the Pyles: whereof is from one dragme to thrée dragmes to be taken, and that according to the importance of the person. Electuarium vitae. §. 46. THis is called a Confection of life, and is described in the first part, the second Chapter, and first §. Of Ley. §. 47. THe auncient Phisitions, as they were very diligent and curious in searching out the vertues of all things, thereby to withstand all diseases of mankind, so haue they not omitted to search out the nature of Ashes, for to discerne (of whatsoeuer wood that the same be burnt) which should be the most commodious and fit, and they haue in truth found no small efficacie and power in them, as is shewed here and there in this booke. For to make excellent spice or sugar Cakes. §. 48. ALbeit that these cakes may be vsed for the strengthening of the stomacke, and of the head in Phisicke, neuerthelesse they be more eaten of licorousnesse: but for their abuse we will not omit their description. First, take wheate and Rie flowre, of each about a pound and a halfe, clarified Hony as much as is néed∣full for to kneade this flowre to dough; then temper amongst it these spices fol∣lowing, all beaten small, to wit, Cinnamom two ounces, Greines, Nutmegs, and Cloues of each halfe an ounce, long Pepper one quarter of an ounce, Mace and Galingall, of each one dragme, Cucubes one quarter of an ounce, prepared Coriander one ounce and a halfe, then make thereof round or long Cakes, and let them be slowly baked, when they be then almost baked, then annoint them oftentimes with wine, then do they get aboue an orient or pleasant colour. The right Sugar cakes be made thus: Take a pound of Sugar, which is decocted to a sirup, and when you haue taken it from the fire, then temper amongst it foure ounces of Wheate flowre, and about foure ounces of Rie floure, and make a past thereof: at last put these spices vnto it, viz. Ginger two ounces and a halfe, Cinnamom two ounces, Cloues halfe an ounce, Nutmegs, long Pepper, of each one quarter of an ounce, prepared powned Coriander half an ounce, Annis (also vnbeaten) thrée quarters of an ounce, and so let them drie together. Other which be daily vsed: Take Sugar two pound, and powre a quart of water vnto it, let it séeth together, and clarifie it well with whites of Egs, when as now the water is sodden to the halfe, then kneade amongst it fiue pound of flowre, two ounces of Ginger, two ounces and a halfe of Cinnamom, Nutmegs and Cloues, of each one ounce, Pepper one dragme, and let them drie. If you will make them of Hony, then take thrée pints of Hony, and a quart of water, let it séeth, and clarifie it, then put therewith as is before rehearsed. The Bisket cakes be thus made: take of the old baked cakes, as many as you please, and greate them on a grater, then put Hony and spices vnto it, and then bake them once againe.
The Noremberger Sugar cakes be made after this manner: Take one pound and a halfe of Sugar, Cinnamom thrée ounces and a halfe, Nutmegs 2. ounces, Ginger 3. ounces, Cloues and Cardamome, of each halfe an ounce, cut them, but not too grosse, and then take thereto one pint of Honie, set it on the fire that the Hony may melt, and afterwards take the Sugar, stirre the same beaten very small amongst it, and so let it séeth very softly, that it do not burn or run ouer, stirring it alwaies well about, then mixe therein as much flowre and spice as is néedfull, and worke it vpon a table: at last make cakes thereof about the waight of sixe ounces, & worke each a part, and bake them afterwards as behooueth. Loch, Lohot. §. 49. THus do the Apothecaries name certaine mild Confections, which haue but little diffe∣rence from other Confections, and therefore be they separated from the other, that one might know how to aske for them. Loch ad Astm, that is for a heauie breath: this Loch is not much in vse, it is good for a hea∣uie wheasing breath, for an old cough, and it doth cause all tough matter of the Lights to auoid. De Cancris, of Crabs: this Loch is very good in the Consumption. De Fafara, of Folefoot leaues: this Loch is to be vsed as all the rest. De Papauere: this Loch is somewhat troublesome to be made, and is commonly made at all Apothecaries: it is good against all coughs, and roughnesse of the throate, which be cause of a hote defluxion, which may be perceiued by the thin and subtill spettle, and it maketh the same thicke. There be two other Confections mo made of Poppies, vnder ye name of Diacodion: amongst which that is which Mesua describeth, and is thus made: take gréene Poppie heads, that be somewhat withered, fiue or sixe in number, and faire raine water 10. ounces; let them séeth toge∣ther, so that there remaine a third part: vnto this colature adde wine, and when the two third parts be wasted, then put vnto it one ounce and a halfe of good Hony, halfe an ounce of soft A∣catia, Saffron, Myrrhe, & Pomegranat blossomes, of each half a drag. Trocisci Ramich one quar∣ter of an ounce: temper thē all together, as appertaineth: but there will be too little Hony, there∣fore must more be taken. It is to be noted, that this may also be made into losinges: they be ve∣ry good for them that haue any subtill defluxion falling on the brest, great coughs, and other diseases mo. De Passulis, of Currans: how it is to be prepared, and what his vertues are, looke in the first part, the fift Chapter, and 12. §. De Pino, of Pingles: this is to be sought for in the first part, the fift Chapter, and 6. §. which is good for al old coughs, & for the short breath; it causeth all tough fleame of the Lights to auoid. De Portulaca, of Purslain: this is not often vsed by vs, but there are two kinds made in Ita∣lie, which follow herafter: take the clarified iuice of Purslain 12. ounces, Trocisci of sealed earth, and Opium of each one drag. Trocisci de Carobe, and Dragonbloud, of each halfe a dragm. burnt Hares haire, and Bloudstone, of each one scrup. white Sugar sixe ounces, then séeth it like other Loch. This is especiall good against spetting of bloud, especially if it be tempered with this con∣fection following: take Henbane séed, white Poppy séed, of each 10. drag. red & white sealed earth of each fiue drag. Conserue of Roses 4. ounces; temper them together, giue it in the morning & euening, each time halfe a drag. The other: Take of the aforesaid thrée quarters of an ounce, Philonij Persici 3. drag. Trocisci de Carobe one drag. and a halfe, Species Diatragacanthi frigidi halfe an ounce, temper them together with Purslaine water as before. De pulmone Ʋulpis, of the Lights of a Foxe: how highly the same is to be praised, and how the same is to be prepared, is to be read in the first part, Chap. 5. and §. 12. Sanum expertum, that is as much to say, as healthy and approued, viz. for all old coughes and shortnesse of the breath, &c. De Scilla, of Squils: how the same is to be prepared and vsed for all old coughes, that may you reade in the first part, the fift Chapter, and 7. §. The 11. Chapter. WE will discourse in this 11. Chapter of many sundry causes, as followeth hereafter.
Almond milke. §. 1. ALmond milke is prepared after many maners, and that according to the quali∣tie of the sicknesse. If so be that one will strengthen nature, then is the same to be made the stronger and the thicker, and one must take the more Almonds, and lesse water. But this is the common fashion to make it: Take Almonds as many as you please, put them in hot water, and let them stéepe so long there∣in, vntill one can péele them: then powre cold water vpon them, that through the heate of the water, they lose no vertue; afterwards powne the péeled Almonds very small, and take them in a very cleane cloth, powre thrée or foure spoonefuls of faire water vpon it, and then with a spoone rub out the strength, and so powring only more and more faire water vpon it: you are to continue this straining, viz. so long as you suppose yt there cometh out any white∣nes, then put as much Sugar vnto it as you thinke good. If you will vse it for sleepe, then pown a little white Poppy séedes, and rub that through with the Almonds. If you desire that the Al∣mond milke be more cooling, then stamp a little Melon séede with it: if one will vse it against the fluxe, then is the water to be stéeled: for the breast be Currans and Licoras to be sodden in it: there be also Pingles otherwhiles powned, Hasell nuts, and such like things with it, all accor∣ding to the qualitie of the maladie. And albeit that this Almond milke be vsed for the kitchin, yet it is also good for many kinds of infirmities and sicknesses. Manus Christi. §. 2. HOw these losinges are to be prepared after two manner of sorts, with Pearles, and also without Pearles, that is in the first part, the third Chapter, and ninth §. described, and they be very much in vse, so that the common people estéeme them onely to be a streng∣thening of the heart, although there are more forcible things prepared for it. Marchpane. §. 3. TAke good fresh Almonds, as many as you please, and péele them, as we haue taught of Almond milke: or if one haue so much leysure, lay them a whole night to stéepe in cold water, then will the péeles go off; afterwards powne them small in a stone mortar, and powre a little Rosewater vnto it: at last you are to powne amongst it as much Sugar as you please, whether it be much or little, this dough or past is to be spread on waters. But if the dough be too moist, then hasten not with baking; otherwise will it be full of bladders. These Marchpanes be most méetly baked in an ouen, the top and bottome couered with a mild fire, laying the Marchpane very drie therein, and there is laid for the more certaintie a paper be∣neath vpon the bottome of the pan or ouen. Will you haue the Marchpane very white? then must you make the fire very slow. But if you will make a Marchpane to strengthen one (for which it was first of all found out) then must you adde Pingles, Pistacies, and other spices vnto it, and also water of Spike, of Lauander, of Endiue, or take any other waters, as Cinna∣mom water, and such like. The Sugar is also to be sod méetly hard; and when it is well clari∣fied, then stirre it, and mixe afterwards the powned Almonds amongst it. For to counterfeit Marrow of bones. §. 4. TAke peeled Almonds, powne them very small, and make them often wet with Rosewater, afterwards then temper foure ounces of beaten Sugar amongst it: and to the end it may be harder, in rolling it put two ounces more of Sugar vnto it, and strew that on the outside v∣pon it, then forme it as you thinke good, and bake it like Marchpane. Medicamen de Turbith. §. 5. THe manner to make both these powders, and their vertues haue we declared in the third part, the 11. Chapter, and 20. §.
Melicraton. §. 6. THis do we call in English wine meade, whereof the auncient Phisitions do make two sorts, for the one they tooke two parts of sowre wine, and one part of Hony. When this is waxen old, then it is nourishing: when it is meetly old, then it is very requisite for the sto∣macke and the belly, and it expelleth also vrine: but after meate it is not very wholesome to be drunken. If one will vse the same quickly, then must these two things be boyled together. O∣ther do take sixe parts of Must, and let the same be hot, then do they powre a quart of Hony vn∣to it, and when it hath boyled awhile, then do they preserue the same. This Meluraton is be∣foretime much more vsuall than now adaies, and especially with the Romaines, which called the same Ʋinum Muscum. Of Meade, a common drinke. §. 7. THe Hony water and the Meade are not onely inuented for their vertue, but also for ne∣cessitie, chiefly in such Countreys where no wine groweth, or may not be vsed. And it is very true, that this drinke is more wholesome than sulphured wine; for although the Mead be hote by nature, yet it is tempered with moisture, wherefore it cannot ouerheate nor ouer∣drie one. And albeit that this Meade may be made according to the fashion of euery Countrey, diuersely: yet neuerthelesse is this the commonest manner, viz. that one take eight quarts of water vnto one quart of Hony, and so let it séethe by a gentle fire, skumming it so long vntill it begin to be cleare. It is also here to be noted, that how much longer you thinke to keepe the Meade, so much the longer are you to séeth the same. When it is cold, then put it into a vessell, and let it be three fingers emptie, to the end it may worke. If so be that you desire to haue the same stronger and more forcible, then hang these spices following in it, viz. Ginger, Cinna∣mom, Cloues, Galingall, Nutmegs, and such like, and that in waight, as we shall write here∣after of the aromaticall wines. Some do take also Saffron vnto it, not onely for the colour, but also for his vertue, and for that it yéeldeth a good sauour to the Meade. When it hath spurged or wrought, then is the same to be letten lye stopped the space of thrée moneths. But in case you desire to vse it presently, then séeth the same not long, and expect not her working, but drinke it fréely as soone as it is cold, and then the next day make new againe. In Liefeland they haue in some places a custome, that they hoope their vessels with Iron, and so bury the Meade vnder the earth, and this will be stronger than any wine, but we will permit such Countreys to kéepe their customes. If you do desire to make quickly a good Meade, then take a good Nutmeg, and one ounce of Cinnamom cut small, and powre thereon thrée quarts of water, then let the third part séeth away, and then put vnto it halfe a pound of clarified Hony: this being done, let it séeth againe together, vntill that there remaine about a good quart. In old time was this Mead following to be made: Take Hony combs, wash the same well with lukewarme water, and afterwards let it séeth well. But if it be not swéet enough, then put more hony vnto it, and scumme it well: afterwards put thereto prepared Coriander halfe a pound, Sage and Hops, of each one handfull, let a third part séeth away, and so kéepe it in a firre fat, at last hang Valerian, Cinnamom, Cloues, Nutmegs, and Mace therein. Another sort: Take as much skummed honie as you please, put the same into a clean leaded pot, and powre as much water vnto it as you please, then take Sage and Marioram (according as you desire it to be strong.) If you will put any Cinnamom vnto it, that is also not amisse, then let it séeth together, and skumme it well. If so be that you desire to haue it browne, then take two or thrée spoonfuls of honie, and let the same séeth well, and stirre it well about vntill that it be strong, as soone as you take it from the fire, then powre presently water vpon it it will boyle together, and then powre the rest vnto it, straine out the herbes, and then keepe it in a sellar. The common vertues of these Meades be, that they quench thirst: It is also good for all cold diseases of the braines, of the backbone, of the sinewes, and for all other diseases, for which wine is hurtfull, by his penetrating vertue and force, it cleanseth and openeth the breast, it taketh away the cold drie cough, it cleanseth the kidneys, the raines, the conduits of vrine, and the bladder, of al cold slimie matter wherof the grauel and the stone doth grow, and it expelleth
also all hurtfull matter out of the guts, wherefore the same is to be vsed in all diseases of the braines, as in the giddines, in the falling sicknesse, and in lamenesse which is cause thereby. In like manner it is good for them that be plagued with the Crampe, and the hote Podagra. The 12. Chapter. THis twelfth Chapter hath no more than two sorts of compounded things, as oyls and some other which be made with vineger, which be therefore called Oxymel, O∣xycraton, Oxysacchara, and such like. First we will write of Oyles, whereof there is much declared, and adde thereto, for what they are to be vsed: amongst which there be some first of Plants, of Fruites, and of Seedes, as well prest as beaten out: other by the addition of certaine herbes, flowers, rootes, and other things which be deco∣cted therewith. Some are distilled, and by force of the fire be drawne out of Rootes, out of Mines, out of Mettals, and such like things: and the manner of making them is diuers, wher∣of we will write hereafter, and also declare thereby for what each of them shall be good. Oyle of Poplar buds. §. 1. BEcause that in the making of all oyles there must héede be taken that the herbs, flowers, rootes, and such like be not put too moist into the oyle, the same must first of all be withered a little, and afterwards be chopt small, to the end the ver∣tue and force may come the better out of it. If you haue not the hote Sun, then let it séeth in a narrow pot in hote water. If so be that you renew the herbes or the flowers two or thrée times, then is the oyle the more forcible. And now to come to our oyle of Poplar buds: Take Sallad oyle 12. ounces, white wine twelue ounces, fresh Poplar buds (which be powned) nine ounces, then let them stéepe the space of seuen daies in the wine and oyle, and stirre them oftentimes about, afterwards boile it in a narrow pot in water, vntill all the wine be wasted, and afterwards wring it thorough a cloth. It is also to be noted, like as is beforesaid, that if so be you do renew the Poplar buds two or three times, that then the oyle will be the more forcible, which may also be well done. This oyle is very good a∣gainst headach, paine of the ioynts, of the raines, of the kidneys, and against the paine of the Gout, with other paines moe. Oyle of Mandragora. §. 2. IT is oftentimes before declared, what force the Mandragora hath, to wit, that it causeth sléepe, and causeth insensiblenesse. This oyle is prepared and made in the same manner as al oyles of other rootes are made, but it is very seldome vsed but when great need doth require. Oyle of Amber. §. 3. ALl they that delight in distillations, and haue indeuoured themselues to draw out the purest and cleanest out of all things, they haue also found great vertue in the oyle of Amber; for which there hath bene made especiall ouens, glasses and other preparati∣ons, &c. which were here too long to discourse, but we wil onely declare her vertue & vse. First, there is nothing more forcible against all venimous ayre, if one rub a drop thereof in the nos∣trels. In like manner the losinges are also good, amongst which two or thrée drops of this oyle is tempered. The same is good against all sicknesses of the head as against ye Palsey, and against the falling sicknes, if one take it with Betonie water, or with any such like water, and annoint it outwardly vpon the necke: but that is especially good which is distilled of the white Amber. It is also very good for all diseases of the sinewes, as for the cramp, the lamenesse, and such like, it expelleth the stone, and the grauell, if the same be giuen with the water of Parsly: it furthe∣reth also Child birth if it be giuen with water of Verueine, so doth it also if one annoint the nauell on the outside with Snakes grease and it together. It is also very commodious against the suffocation of the moother, if one annoint the same in the nostrils, and vpon the pit of the
heart. The losinges wherein this oyle is baked, be speciall good against all cold rheumes, they strengthen the braines, they be good against all swouning and heartbeating, and they do also strengthen the digestiue power of the stomack. In fine, this oyle may be vsed in stead of the true and naturall Balme. Artificiall Balme. §. 4. OF this artificiall Balme, and how the same is made after diuerse manners, and distilled, we haue declared before in the second Chapter sufficiently. Sallade oyle, or oyle of Oliues. §. 5. THis Sallade oyle is of all people so well knowne, that whereas oyle standeth without any surname, thereby alwayes Sallade oyle is vnderstood: and it is also a gracious gift of God, that people may vse the same for sundrie necessaries, which were too long to dis∣course: for how many kinds of Plaisters, Salues, Oyles and Clisters, &c. be prepared of this oyle? But as much as concerneth this Sallade oile, there be thrée sorts of the same vsed for Phi∣sicke, to wit, one that is thorow ripe, the second that which is not thorow ripe, the third, which is very old, for that each one of the thrée hath his proper nature: that which is cleane ripe is of a warme nature, so that it defendeth the bodie from all cold being annointed thereon, it refre∣sheth all the members, and maketh them fit for labour, it suppleth all the whole bodie and the skinne, it asswageth all paine of the ioynts, it cleareth the sight, it is good against all venime if one drinke the same often and vomiteth it vp againe: so that the ancient Phisitions haue left a prouerbe behind them, Wine sustaineth the bodie within, and Oyle outwardly. When the oyle is aboue a yeare old, then doth it lose much of her pleasantnesse, and the best driueth al∣way aboue, which is contrary in Hony, wherein the best doth lye alwayes vnderneath, and the best of the wine is alwayes in the middle. The oile which is prest out of the vnripe Oliues, that is called Omphacinum, the same hath power for many kinds of things, and especially in Salues: it is also verie méete for the stomacke through her astringent vertue, likewise it doth fasten the gummes and the téeth. The old oyle is hotter than the other, and hath also more vertue to di∣gest, it strengtheneth much the sight if it be annointed vnder the eyes, if one can get no old oile, then looke before into the Introduction how that the oyle is to be prepared. Oyle of Behen. §. 6. THis oyle of the rootes of red and white Behen is not verie vsuall, howbeit that we do some∣times remember it in this booke. Oyle of Pyrethrum. §. 7. IT is an oyle which is verie hote, and that is not made at the Apothecaries, but onely if the same be prescribed to be made, therefore we will write no further thereof. Oyle of Beuercod. §. 8. THe Apothecaries do make a certaine oyle of Beuercod, which is made of many kinde of things for all cold diseases, and especially for all diseases of the sinewes, and paine of the ioynts. It is very good for the Palsey, and stifnesse of the necke. It allayeth the cold in Agues if the backe bone be annointed with it. But we will here describe that which is easie to be made: Take Beuercod one ounce, Euphorbium thrée dragmes, Myrrha one quarter of an ounce, white strong wine eight ounces, Sallade oyle twelue ounces: let it séeth so long together vntill the wine be throughly consumed, afterwards straine it and kéepe it. Oyle of Lead. §. 9. THis oyle of Lead is thus made: Take drie Ceruse one pound, Vineger which is two times distilled, one quart or more, and séeth it in a narrow pot in séething water an houre space,
but stirre it often about, and let it settle: afterwards distill it through a Filter, to the end the vineger may run thorough it, and the oyle tarrie in it: do this two or three times; then set this oyle in sand, and distill it slowly, then will come out of it that which is faire and cleane. This oyle healeth all vlcers maruellous well, as we in the fifth Part, the fourth Chapter, and 4. §. haue taught. Another. Take Lead as much as you please, and beate it very thin, then powre as much distilled vineger vpon it vntill it be well couered, then will it be lead white. When it is now cleane consumed, then set it certaine dayes in the hote sunne, or in horsedung, and after∣wards distill it in sand, vntill that the water which distilleth do alter, then set another receiuer before it, and there cometh a ruddie oyle out of it. Oyle of Penniroyall. §. 10. THis oyle is made like oyle of Cammomill. You may adiudge the vertue by the propertie of the herbe, yet it is not much vsed. Oyle of Purslaine. §. 11. THis oyle is prepared as the oyles of other herbes, but it is made very seldome. Oyle of Cammomill. §. 12. THis oyle is thus made: Take well sauoring Cammomill as much as you please, put it into a pot, and powre vpon it as much old Sallade oyle, vntill all the Cammomill be wel couered, and then set it the space of fourtéene dayes in the sunne, or in some other warme place: afterwards let them séeth in a narrow pot in séething water, and then put out the Cam∣momill, and put in fresh againe, and let it séeth againe, then wring it out well, and do this thrée times one after another, and then kéepe it vntill you haue occasion to vse it. This oyle is good for many kind of things, it openeth the pores and sweat vents, it expelleth vapors, it allayeth rheumes, it is good for the sinewes, for all paine of the ioynts, and asswageth also the paine of the guts. Oyle of Capers. §. 13. THe oyle of Capers is most commonly made at the Apothecaries in this manner: Take Capers rootes one ounce, rinds and leaues of Tamariske, the séeds of Agnus castus, Harts tongue, and Cipers rootes, of each one quarter of an ounce, Rue one dragme, Vineger and good wine, of each one quarter of an ounce, ripe Sallad oyle twelue ounces, powne the roots grosly, and let them steepe a whole night, afterwards séeth them in an especiall pot in boyling water, straine and kéepe it. This oyle is especially good for all hardnesse, obstructions, and paine of the Spléene, but you may in séething put some more wine and vineger. Oyle of Costus. §. 14. TAke of the verie true and good rootes of Costus one ounce, Cassie wood, or Elecampane rootes in stead of it, halfe an ounce, sprigs of Marierome gentle foure ounces, oyle of Se∣samum eightéene ounces, and wine as much as sufficeth. Let it stéepe two dayes and two nights, afterwards let it séeth all together in water vntill the wine be throughly wasted, which you may perceiue hereby, if that you let one drop fall into the fire, and that it hisse no more. This oyle is of a warme nature, it openeth the obstruction of the stomacke and of the Liuer. It is good against all diseases of the sinewes, it auoideth the growing of gray haires, it preserueth the body in his naturall colour. In the first Part you haue two other sorts of oyle of Costus, which may also be vsed for ad∣uantage, and they be also hoter than this present oyle is. Oyle of Dill. §. 15. THe oyle of Dill is made of the herbe, of the floures, & of old oyle, like as oyle of Cammomill is made. This oyle asswageth all paine, it openeth the pores, it consumeth wind, also all
cold and hard swellings, it taketh away the shaking of the Ague, it maketh one to sléepe, and ta∣keth away all paine of the head in hote Agues, if the backe bone be therewith annointed. Oyle of Egges. §. 16. HOw this oyle is made, and what it hath for efficacie and power, is taught in the first part, the third Chapter, and sixt §. Oyle of Annis. §. 17. THis oyle of Annis is made by distilling in this manner: Take one pound of small beaten Annis, and put it into a glased helme, and powre so much water vpon it vntill the helme be halfe full: but distill it the first time with a milde or slow fire in boyling water, vntill it begin to be hote, afterwards make a good fire, vntill that the oyle and the water do go ouer together. Now being distilled, then separate the water and the oyle one from another with a glasen funnell, for that the oyle swimmeth al∣wayes on the top. This oyle hath a great force against the giddinesse of the head, and against the Collicke, and is also highly commended against the falling sicknesse, if one giue therof thrée or foure drops. It is here to be noted, that if one will distill any such like, that one is alwayes to take for one pound, two or thrée pound of water. Oyle of wild Cucumbers. §. 18. THis oyle is not vsuall in this countrey: But for what it is meete, looke for that in the Table. Oyle of Euphorbium. §. 19. THis oyle is thus made: Take Euphorbium halfe an ounce, oyle of yellow Violets, and good wine, of each fiue ounces, let it séeth so long vntill that all the wine be consumed; af∣terwards wring it through a cloth: it is especiall good for the cold braines and sinewes. In like manner it is also good against the paines of the head Cephalalgia, Hemicrania, and against the sléepie sicknesse, if one annoint it in the nostrels. Item, for all paine of the ioynts, of the Li∣uer, and of the Spléene, if it procéed of cold. Oyle of Foxes. §. 20. BEfore in the second Part, the fourth Chapter, and 15. §. there is found this oyle of Foxes, and therewithall also his operation. Oyle of Lillies. §. 21. TAke the white leaues of Lillies, and prepare the oyle like as is said of the Cammomils. This oyle healeth all cold paine of the breast, of the reines and the bladder, and especially of the Matrix, and also all paine of the guts. For that it is of an hote nature, it hath power to digest, it asswageth the cough, it ripeneth all impostumations, it drieth all bad sores of the head, and it diminisheth also all swellings, if one temper a little Saffron amongst it. Oyle of Hempeseed. §. 22. OVt of Hempe seede is this oyle beaten: it warmeth and drieth much, therefore it doth consume naturall seede: yea if one eate too much of the same, then doth it the same hurt that Coriander doth: wherefore the same is verie seldome, and that verie little vsed in Physicke, as also thereof but twice hath bene spoken in this Booke.
Oyle of the kernels of Abrecocks. §. 23. OVt of the kernels of this fruite is oyle prest, like as is done of Almonds, but it is very sel∣dome prepared in this countrey. Oyle of Elderne floures. §. 24. YOu are to make oyle of Elderne floures and of old Sallade oyle, as oyle of Cammomill is made. It asswageth the paine, it cleanseth, and is very good for the yellow Iaundies, and all diseases of the Liuer, and also for their obstructions: likewise it doth also take away all paine of the ioynts. Oyle of Saint Iohns woort. §. 25. OF this herbe, you must take the tops when it beginneth to ripen, to wit, the vp∣permost sprigs thrée ounces, steepe them thrée dayes long in good Wine: after∣wards wring them out well, and then put other in againe and let it seeth toge∣ther. Being sodden, wring it againe euen to the third time: and if the wine were sod away, then put more vnto it. Lastly, take three ounces of Turpen∣tine, old Sallade oyle sixe ounces, Saffron one scruple: put this altogether in a seuerall pot, and so let it séeth in séething water, so long vntil the wine be consumed: then wring it hard through a cloth, and let it settle: so do the Apothecaries make it. The Chirurgians do make it in this manner: Take foure pound of the vppermost sprigs of Saint Iohns woort, put them into a pot of the quantitie of fiue quarts, and powre two pound of Sallade oyle vpon it, and as much white wine vntill the herbes be couered: then stop the pot tight, and so let it stand the space of sixe wéekes: afterwards make it open, and put one dragme of Saffron vnto it, but stop the pot by and by very close, and set it in a kettle with séething water, and so let it séeth the space of ten houres. This being all done, then powre it all together in a linnen bag, and bind it very fast vnto it, and presse it hard out whilest that it is yet warme, put it in a glasse and set it in the sunne, or in another warme place; then will the oyle come on the top, lade it off then con∣tinually, and kéepe it well stopt in a glasse. This oyle is hote and drie, and hath an especiall a∣stringent vertue: therefore it doth also heale all wounds and all wounded sinewes; yea all bur∣ning of fire, it asswageth all paine of the hips, of the bladder, and doth expell vrine, &c. Oleum Irinum. §. 26. THere are two kinds described, and are both very troublesome to be made, they be also not much vsed. Oyle of Cherrie kernels. §. 27. THis oyle is also very seldome vsed, and is made like as oyle of Almonds by pressing, and is much commended for mouing of vrine. Oyle of Melilot. §. 28. SO is it also with this oyle of Melilot, it is also seldome made, and also very seldome vsed. Oyle of Cresses. §. 29. THis oyle is also very seldome made, yet it is made like all oyles of herbes. Oyle of Copper §. 30. THis oyle do the Alchymists distill, like the oyle of Lead, whereof there be two kinds descri∣bed before, and there is no other difference betwéene them, but that the Copper is some∣what smaller to be cut, and must be beaten somewhat thinner.
Oyle of Gourd seeds. §. 31. THis oyle is not vsuall with vs, and is very seldome vsed. Oyle of Lineseede. §. 32. THe vertue of this oyle may be gathered by the properties of the séed out of which it is bea∣ten, and also out of many places of this booke, wherein they be commanded to be vsed. Oyle of white Sesamum. §. 33. THis oyle is made of the séed Sesamum, and it is also beaten out of the foresaid séed, like as the Lineseede oyle, it hath a speciall power to ease all rough throats, to take away all hoarse∣nesse, and to make one haue a good voyce: wherefore it is vsed in many parts of Phisicke. Oyle of Linnen cloth. §. 34. HOw this oyle is to be vsed, we haue told in the first Part, and also taught therewith how the same is to be made. It is to be vsed for all running eyes. Oyle of Bay. §. 35. THis oyle is brought vnto vs by the merchants in great quantitie out of Italy: it is warme by nature, it openeth all obstructions, and asswageth all paines of the bowels, also all cold paines of the bellie, of the Liuer, of the Milt, the Kidneyes, the Matrix, of the sinewes, and of the ioynts, and is also very good for all cold sicknesses. Oyle of Mace. §. 36. THis oyle is brought vnto vs out of Indy, and vsed for diuers cold accidents. Oyle of the seeds and flowers of Poppie. §. 37. FIrst of all there will be made of this plant and of the white flowers an oyle, which is more milde than the red and carnation flowers be, and will be made with Sallade oyle, like as Cammomill oyle is wont to be made, yet at sundrie times renewing the infusing of the flowers, according to that one desireth to haue it strong. This oyle asswageth all hote paine, it cooleth much, and is very good for all them that cannot sléepe well, if the temples of the head be annointed therewith: and as the hote vapours do draw to the head, in any hote sicknesses, also the nostrels, the eares, and the temples of the head may be annointed with it. The oyle which is made of the séeds of this herbe, is made of the white, gray and blacke séed, and beaten out of it, as the oyle of Lineséed is made: it maketh fat, it asswageth the paine of the throate, heate of the Agues, and all heauie dreames. Oyle of sweete Almonds. §. 38. THere be two kindes made thereof (of swéete and bitter Almonds.) This oyle is pressed out or beaten out vpon a powning mill, like as the oyle of Lineséed is beaten out. But if one will drinke the oyle, then take Almonds well dried, which haue a fresh and swéete taste, as much as you please, powne them very small, and parch them a little, afterwards put a Rosewater vnto it, and presse it well out with a strong presse. But the oyle of sweete Almonds is much vsed. The oyle of swéete Almonds is good against the roughnesse of the throate, of the breast, of the lights, and against all drought of the same. Further, it asswageth all paine of the ioynts, it is also verie pleasant for to be occupied in all meates, and good for all them which beginne to consume, it maketh fat, and augmenteth humaine nature, it quencheth thirst, it allayeth the heate of the vrine, and all paine of the bladder, together with all vlcers of the
womanhood, if the same be annointed thereon or iniected therein. The oile of bitter Almonds doth asswage all hardnesse of the sinewes, it openeth all obstruc∣tions, it consumeth wind and all bad vapours, and it is especiall good for deafnesse and all bad hearing, for all sissing of the eares, and it taketh also away all spots. Oyle of Marierome gentle. §. 9. TAke the herbe Marierome gentle foure handfuls, wilde Thime two handfuls, Mirtle leaues one handfull, Sothernwood and Mints, of each halfe a handfull, Cassie wood two ounces, vnripe Sallad oyle as much as will suffise for to couer all the foresaid; then stop it tight, and so let it stand the space of eight dayes in the sunne: afterwards wring it out hard, and lay fresh againe therein: do this thus thrée times together. This oile is speciall good for all diseases of the braines and of the sinewes, and it is especiall good in bathing against all lame∣nesse, or conuulsion of the Palsey Paralysis: if the same be annointed in the eares and in the nose it taketh away all sissing: it moueth womens termes, and it withstandeth all venime of Scor∣pions. Some do make this oyle onely of the leaues, like as Cammomill oyle is made, and it is made most so. Oyle of Masticke. §. 40. THe manner to make this oyle, and also his vertue is described in the third part, the eleuenth Chapter, and fifth §. Oyle of Narcissus. §. 41. THis oyle is called by the Phisitions Oleum Narcissum, and is made like as oyle of Cam∣momill is wont to be made. This oyle is very good for the hardening of the womanhood, or if the same be shut too close: it is also vsed for the Palsey that cometh of falles. Oyle of Mirtles. §. 42. OF this oyle be two kinds made: that which is made of the séede hath an astringent ver∣tue, wherefore it is also good for all hote vlcers, and for the chaps of the Arsegut; it strengtheneth the slacknesse or loosenesse of the sinewes, and it stayeth sweat. But that which is made of the leaues, strengtheneth onely the braines, the sinewes, the heart, and the stomacke: but because that we can get no fresh, they are first to be infused in good wine, and to put vnripe Sallade oyle vnto it. Oyle of Mints. §. 43. THis oyle is made of Mints and vnripe Sallade oyle, like as the oyle of Cammomill is wont to be made. This oyle warmeth the cold stomacke, it taketh away vomiting, it ma∣keth appetite to meate, it helpeth the Consumption, and it consumeth all hard swellings. Oyle of Motherwort. §. 44. THis oyle is very seldome vsed, and is made as other oyles, yet in this booke it is but once ordained. Oyle of Nutmegs. §. 45. THis oyle is made like as the oyle of Almonds is wont to be made, that is, by pressing it out. Oyle of Cloues. §. 46. TAke good fat Cloues half a pound, powne them very small, and distil it, like as before in the 18. §. hath bin said of Annis séed. A pound of Cloues doth seldome yéeld more than an ounce
and a halfe of oyle. In the same manner may oyle of Nutmegs be also distilled, and there is hardly more gotten out of it than fiue dragmes out of a pound: both these oyles are more forci∣ble than th same spices. Oyle of Walnuts. §. 47. THis oyle of Walnuts is prest out of old Nuts, like as oyle of Almonds: his vertue do we find described in sundry places of this Booke. Oyle of Pepper. §. 48. WE will refer the preparing of this oyle to the Apothecaries; but it is good for all cold diseases of the sinews, as for the palsy, the cramp, conuulsion of the mouth, shaking, falling sicknes, paines of the hips,, and other diseases mo of the ioynts. In like manner it is also good for a cold stomacke, for the guts, for the raines, and for the cold bladder: for that it warmeth, it auoideth all slimines, it openeth all obstructions, it breaketh the stone of the bladder, and also of the kidneys. There is also oyle distilled out of Pepper, like as is said of the Annis. Oyle of Peach Kernels. §. 49. THis oyle is also prest out like to the oyle of Almonds. Oyle of Quinces. §. 50. THe vertue and nature of this oyle, and also the maner of making it, is described in the third Part, the 15. Chap. and 5. §. Oyle of Rue. §. 51. THis oyle is to be made of fresh Rue, like as oyle of Cammomill is made: it is warme by nature, it openeth and swageth the paine, it is good for all cold kidneys, for a cold Ma∣trix, and for the paine of the same, if the belly be annointed therewith, or if one set a cli∣ster with it. It is very méete for the sinewes, for the crampe, and it expelleth all cold humors. Oyle of Earthwormes. §. 52. IN the fourth part, the fourth Chapter, is the vertue of one of these oyles shewed and the manner how to make it. But there is also another made, which doth warme more, doth penetrate more, and strengtheneth all the ioynts: Take Cā∣momill, Sage, Agrimonie, and field Cipers, of each halfe a handfull, Rosemary halfe as much, Iuniper berries one quarter of an ounce, Earthworms decocted in Wine sixe ounces, white Wine one pint, Sallad oyle fiftéene ounces: let it séeth together vntill the wine be throughly consumed, and then wring it out through a cloth. Oyle of Priuet. §. 53. THe Phisitions and Apothecaries do name this Priuet Ligustrum. This oyle is made as the oyle of Cammomill, it strengtheneth all sinewie parts, and hindreth the haire to be gray. Oyle of Rubarbe. §. 54. TAke Rubarbe nine ounces, Agaricus thrée ounces, Turbith thrée ounces and a halfe, rootes of Polipodie foure ounces, Cinnamom and Iuniper berries, of each halfe an ounce, red, white, and yellow Saunders, of each foure scruples, long and round Hartwoort, Gentian, rootes of blew Flower deluce, of Costus, Asarabacca, Zeduarie, Ginger, Galingall, Elecampane rootes, and Calmus, of each one quarter of an ounce, Tormentill, & rootes of Carduus Benedictus, of each one dragme and a halfe, Nutmegs, Cloues, Bayberries, Mace, and Cucubes, of each one drag.
the séede of Sorrell, of Purslaine, red and white Behen, and Doronicum, of each halfe a dragme, Lignum Aloes, red and white Corall, scraped Iuorie, Masticke, Spica, and Campher, of each one scruple, burnt Iuorie one dragme: powne them all grosse, and then powre vpon it te clarified iuice of Burrage, and of Balme, of each sixe ounces, the iuice of Oranges three ounces: let it stéepe certaine daies together, stirring it oftentimes about to the end it do not stink: afterwards you are to distil it in seething water, then doth it first of all yeeld a water: but as soone as you perceiue that it begins to get another colour, and that it beginneth to drop slowly, then aug∣ment your fire and receiue your oyle in another receiuer, & keepe it well stopt, at last set it ye space of 20. daies in the Sunne. This oyle is somwhat ruddie, and smelleth very well; so that if one put a drop in a great deale of well water, then getteth it a sauour accordingly. This oyle doth purge very mildly if one giue halfe a dragme thereof more or lesse, according to the qualitie or importance of the patient. This oyle is most méetly giuen with goates milke: it is also especial good against the Quartana, if the patient haue gouerned himselfe well before in his order of dyet. In like manner it is also good in all other Agues, which the Phisitions do call Putridas: it killeth and driueth out the wormes if it be giuen with Purslaine water or with wine. This oyle is also especiall good giuen once euery sixe daies against the Pockes: it is also good against the rheumes, against the paine in the head Cephalalgia, against the giddinesse, and against the paine of the kidneys, it obstructeth womens termes, and the fluxe of humane seede. It is good against the gout of the féete, if once euery fourtéene daies two or thrée drops of this oyle be gi∣uen with the decoction of field Cipers. It is also very good against all running Fistulas, against all vlcers, and against the canker: also for all diseases of the places in women, and of the matrix, if one iniect half a drag. thereof with the decoction of Feuerfew, it prouoketh also fruitfulnesse. The water that commeth out before the oyle hath his vertue also, for that it prepareth all hu∣mors which cause any sicknesse in the bodie, if one once or twice a day take thereof halfe an ounce at each time with thrée ounces of Endiue water. Oyle of Roses. §. 55. AFter the common fashion is this oyle of Roses prepared, and is very méete for diuers matters. It is made of Rose buds as the oyle of Cammomill. This oyle cooleth much, and hath an astringent vertue: it is good for all manner of heate of whatsoeuer occasion that the same may be caused, vsed outwardly, or in cli∣sters inwardly, and it strengtheneth also the ioynts which be annointed there∣with, like as they be ordained for it throughout the whole booke. This oyle is made very seldome of white Roses; and it cooleth also more, than that which is made of red Roses, Oyle of Saffron. 56. THe oyle of Saffron is not vsed by vs, but yet is prescribed in some places of this Booke. Oyle of Sandaraca. §. 57. THis oyle is also vtterly vnknowne, it is but once prescribed in this booke. Oyle of Sulphur. §. 58. THis oyle of Sulphur is an Alchimisticall oyle, and is made in diuers manners: some do put one quarter of Amber vnto it; other do put Petroleum vnto it. In Ita∣ly do they take Sulphur vif, and powre the vrine of a manchild vnto it, & so bury it in horse dung; and afterwards distill the oyle out of it. But after these two ma∣ners following is this oyle chiefly made: Take 5. pounds of smal beaten Sulphur and temper oyle of Tiles amongst it: afterwards lute the helme very tight, and and at the first make a small fire, & afterwards increase it. There is gotten out of the foresaid 5. pounds of Sul∣phur, no more than about one ounce of oyle: this oyle must with great prouidence be giuen, to wit, in winter time two drops with vitall waters or Malmsey, and in sommer time with En∣diue water. This oyle doth asswage all griping of the belly, whether it be in the vndermost or in the vppermost guts: as also all paine of the stomacke which procéedeth of wind and cold hu∣mors:
the same may also well be vsed outwardly. It is likewise very good annointed in the childrens mouthes when they haue the canker, or any stinking vlcer in the mouth. Further warts  also taken away with it, and it maketh the téeth white. To make the other oyle of Sulphur: Take Sallad oyle and powre therin a good deale of smal powned Sulphur, & let it stand so long vpon the fire vntill that all the sulphur be cleane melted, stirring it well about: then are you to quench gloing péeces of coales in it, vntill the oyle be tho∣roughly sunken into the tyle stones. This being done, powne these stones and put them alone in the helme: the rest that ouerfloweth, and also the Sulphur is to be done away, and then di∣still further all that is put into the helme. The first oyle that cometh out of it doth appeare som∣what bleake in the helme; and when it beginneth to be white, then set another receiuer vnder it. This oyle séemeth to guild if it be annointed vpon Iron, or vpon any other thing. Oyle of blew Flower-deluce. §. 59. THis oyle is to be made like the oyle of Lillies, but it will be somewhat strengthe∣ned through the rootes: it is somewhat strong, but it asswageth all paine and mel∣loweth all swellings, it is especiall good against all hardnesse of the ioynts, it war∣meth the Matrix, driueth away the crampe, and taketh away all paine and sissing of the eares: lastly, it doth withstand the canker of the nose. Oyle of Scorpions. §. 60. BEcause that we (God be praised) haue no Scorpions in Eugh, therefore is the oyle brought vnto vs out of Italy, and is made thus: Take tenne or twelue Scorpions, cast them in twelue ounces of oyle of bitter Almonds, and so set it fiue or sixe wéekes in the Sunne; afterwards straine it and kéepe it for to vse. This oyle breaketh the stone of the bladder, and of the rains, and it driueth the same also out, if it be annointed vpon the raines, and vpon the priuities, or if it be iniected into the bladder: lastly, it is also good for many other things moe, &c. Oyle of water Lillies. §. 61. THis oyle is made as wel of the yellow as of the white water Lillies, but vnripe Sallad oyle is taken for it, and it is made as the oyle of Violets. The oyle of the white water Lillies hath also the same vertue with the oyle of Violets, but that it is somewhat colder, but not altogether as cold as that of Poppy heads: wher∣fore these oyles are commonly tempered with other oyles, according to the qua∣litie of the disease. It is very good for them that cannot rest, and for the paine of the kidneys of heate: also it is passing good against all veneriall lusts if the priuities be annoin∣ted with it. It is also vsed for diuers other matters, as may appeare in diuers places of this Booke. Oyle of Mustard seed. §. 62. THis oyle is very seldome vsed, for that it is so hote. Oyle of Spikenard. §. 63. VNder the name of Oleum Nardinum be there two sorts described: we will com∣mend the greater to the Apothecaries, because it containeth diuers doubtfull things, but the smallest is thus prepared: Take good Spikenard thrée ounces, Wine and Water, of each two ounces and a half, oyle of white Sesamum eigh∣téene ounces; seeth them together in hote water vntill that all the moisture be consumed, then straine it. This oyle doth heate, digesteth, and refineth all that is thicke and grosse, and is somwhat astringent: it is good for all cold diseases of the braines, of the stomacke, of the liuer, of the spléene, of the kidneys, and of the bladder, it cleanseth the head if it be annointed in the nose, it maketh a good colour, and also a good sauour. It is brought now adaies méetly good and reasonable cheape out of Fraunce.
Oyle of Antimonie. §. 64. THis oyle is thus prepared: Take a pound of Antimonie, powne it osse, and set it in the fire in a melting crust, when it beginneth to smoake then cast halfe a dragme of Boreas vnto it: when it is molten, then powre it vpon a flat stone and let it be cold, then stampe and melt it againe, like as before, and so do thrée times: afterwards powne it to fine powder, and powre vineger vpon it which is distilled two or thrée times, then put it into a glasse being stopped very tight and close, yet stirre it often about, and that so long vntill the vineger begin to be red, which is wont to happen in the space of a moneth or twaine. This being done, put all together into an helme, luted very close, and distill it with a mild fire so long, vntill the rednesse be discerned, and as soone as that is perceiued, then augment your fire, and fasten another receiuer to it, & make a good fire as long as one drop of oyle comes out of it. Out of a pound of Antimonie you cannot haue aboue one dragme or twaine, according to the goodnesse of it, or ye oyle is well made. This oyle hath a red browne colour, it is also vsed for healing of wounds, & of old vlcers, like as also for all Fistulaes, Leprosie, and for the Pockes, yet neuertheles according to the importance of each sicknesse, if there be a drop or twaine taken tempered with any thing else. The vlcers are washed with the water, but it is very sharpe. Another: Take one pound of Antimonie, pown it small, and put vnto it one quarter of an ounce Mercurium Sublimatum, put it then into a glasse retort, and giue it presently a good fire: there doth come no water out of it, but onely (fiue or sixe howers after) cleare oyle. Oyle of Steele, or oyle of Iron. §. 65. TAke small filed stéele, or iron, and white Flint, powned very small, of each halfe a pound, put it in a glasen helme, and distill it in sand, first with a mild fire, and afterwards al∣waies greater, it giueth first water, and afterwards red oyle, which hath a very pleasant smell, euen like to Balsam. Now for to distill this oyle, then are you to make an ouen after the fashion of a Retort, as the Alchimists do know. These things are rather searching out of the secrets of nature, than necessarie for Phisicke. Rocke or Peteroyle. §. 66. SOme of these oyles be white, some yellow, and there are also some blacke, which is called Naphta. This Peteroyle doth runne in Italy, and also in other places out of the rockes: it doth heate, drie and consume: it is also good for the falling sicknesse, for the Palsey, for doting, and for the enféebled memorie. Oyle of Turpentine. §. 67. THe manner to distill this oyle haue we shewed in the fift part, the thirtéenth Chapter and fourth §. Oyle of Violets. §. 68. THis oyle is made of blew Violets and vnripe Sallad oyle, it is somwhat colder than the oyle of Roses, therefore it doth the more coole all heate, especially the heate of the raines and of the kidneys: in like manner it doth asswage the drie heated brest, and is moreouer good for many other things. The oyle of Wal flowers is prepared also of the flowers, and of old oyle, it is very good a∣gainst the conuulsion of the sinewes, it driueth away all diseases of the breast, the kidneys, and the bladder, and it is also good against all paine of the sinewes and of the Matrix: also it asswa∣geth and melloweth all other diseases. Oyle of Ireas. THe oyle of Ireas is vtterly vnknowne vnto vs.
Oyle of Vitrioll, or of Copperas. §. 69. THis oyle is very highly commended, it getteth an especiall swéetnesse, which is a miraculous worke of nature, and is made thus: Take foure pound of Hungarie Copperas, stampe it very small, and then put it in a great bodie, then let it drie certaine daies: afterwards powne it againe, and so set it in a warme place coue∣red with a fine cloth, to the end that the sauour of Copper may therby auoid. This being done powre foure pound of the best spirit of wine vpon it which is well rectified, sute it well, and so kéepe it fortie daies in a warme place, or dunghill, and afterwards distill it, then shall you see the oyle swimme on the top of the wine. There be yet mo longer and mo other meanes for to distill this oyle, but this is the commonest manner. Concerning the vertue of this oyle, and her force, it is very néedfull that it be prouidently dealt withall, it must alwaies be mixed with somewhat else, for that it is too sharpe, that it will inflame the intrailes, other∣wise hath it the same force of the oyle of Sulphur, but it is much stronger and penetrating. It is very good against all filth, and infection, and against the Plague it is especiall good: it hath al∣so great power to cause the matter of the Pleurisie to auoid out of the breast, it is good for all tough fleame and corruption of the breast to fetch it out, it suffereth also no stone to grow in the bladder, and healeth the brused or perished bladder. There is no more but thrée or foure drops to be giuen with wine. There may also losinges be made of it. Also this oyle is vsed by some, according to the importance of the cause, like as is admonished in certaine places of this booke. This oyle doth strengthen the cold stomacke, it consumeth Phlegma, it causeth all tough and slimie matter to auoid, it is good for the griping of the guts, and against all red fluxes, it quen∣cheth thirst, it withstandeth all wambling and parbraking. Because that these oyles must be driuen through strong fire, it doth happen otherwhiles that the glasses leape in péeces, by which all the cost, the trouble, and labor is lost. Now for to preuent that, are the glasses to be hardened in this manner following: first, are the bodies to be luted very well with lome, and before that you will vse the same, annoint them oftentimes with Allum water, and so let them drie: and if so be that they happen for all that to breake, yet may they afterwards be souldered together, that they may hold water in this manner: Take Venice glasse, red Lead, Linséede oyle, Mill dust, and the white of an Egge, mixe it well toge∣ther, and then spread it meetly thicke vpon the crackes, and let it dry afterwards. Of the oyle of Wheate. §. 70. THe oyle of Wheate is made like as the oyle of Annis séedes is made. Oyle of Iuniper berries. §. 71. THis oyle is drawne out of the powned berries. It may also be distilled like as the oyle of Annis séedes, but because that there is very much brought to sell of it, the same may be bought better cheape than made. That which is distilled out of the wood is made as fol∣loweth: Bury a pot in the ground that it stand about thrée fingers out of it, then take another pot which fitteth well the vndermost, and fill the same with small chips of Iuniper wood, then make ouer it a latten lid with many small holes, that the moisture may drop thorough it, and that the chips fall not into the vndermost pot. This being done, then whelme both these pots one ouer the other, and then make a fire round about the vpper pot a good while, then gather the oyle together which is dropt into the vndermost pot. This oyle is very good against all that that doth outwardly infect the skin, as old vlcers and cankers, but especially against the Varices. The oyle which is drawne out of the wood, hath an vnpleasant sauor, but that which is drawn out of the berries, hath a very pleasant sauour and smell. They haue both of them one opera∣tion. Oyle of Willow leaues. §. 72. THe leaues, flowers, and fruites of this trée haue an astringent vertue, wherby they draw the wounds together and heale them, withstand the spitting of bloud, and take away all
spots of the face. The oyle thereof is good being dropt in the eares, against the paine of the eares: and if the same be annointed on the outside, then it is very good against the Gout, and it taketh away all vnchastnes. There may also oyle be drawen out of Willow wo, as it is drawen out of Iuniper wood. Oyle of Argall. §. 73. TAke fower pound of Argall, poune it very small, and set it to burne in a pot bakers ouen: afterwards poune it againe, and then put it into a woollen bag, and so hang it in a sellar, then will there drop out cléere moysture, which is rather a water than an oyle. Oyle of Wormewood. §. 74. AVncient Phisitions doe make this oyle, of Wormewood which groweth in Ponto, and with vnripe oyle, like as is said of the oyle of Cammomill: but bi∣cause that we haue not that Wormewood, therefore are we to take that of ours; and one must take halfe so much Roses as Wormewood. This oyle hath an especiall power to warme, it strengtheneth also all that is cold, and especi∣ally the stomacke, it maketh an appetite to meate, it openeth all inward parts; and if one annoint it on the Nauell, it killeth the wormes, without any hurt: wherefore it is more profitable for yoong and old people, than the Wormeséede. Oyle of Tyles. §. 75. THis oyle is to be distilled after two wayes, as the same is to be séene in the Table. Oxycraton. §. 76. THese things following do kéepe the Gréeke name with the Phisitions and with the Apothecaries, for Oxys is Vineger: afterwards do they ad somewhat vnto it, which is tempered with the foresaid Vineger, like as with the Oxycraton, where wine, wa∣ter and vineger are tempered togither, which of the Latinists is called Posca: for which the same is now to be vsed, that is to be séene in many places of this booke. Oxymel Simplex. §. 77. THis Oxymel is described in the first Part, the second Chapter, and sixt §. It is very often vsed, and praised for many things. Oxymel Compositum. §. 78. THis is therefore named so, for that it is made of sundrie things, which is also described in the first Part, the second Chapter. Oxymel Scillinum. §. 79. THis is also described in the same place, and vsed oftentimes. Oxyrrhodinum. §. 80. IT is another compound than the former. It is much vsed against the paine of the head, laid vpon it on the outside, there be two kindes of it, as is taught in the second Part. Oxysacchara. §. 81. THis compound, and her vertue and operation, is described in the first Part, the eighth chap∣ter, and second §. The 13. Chapter. THis Chapter is a gathering togither of all kindes of Plaisters and Pils, which be descri∣bed in this booke.
Emplastrum album Coctum. §. 1. WE do monly call this, the white plaister. How it is made, is to be sought for in the Table. Apostolicon Plaister. §. 2. AFter two wayes is this plaister made; whereof one is called Triapharmacon, for that there commeth not aboue thrée things into it: You may looke for both of them in the la∣tine Table. Emplastrum de Baccis Lauri. §. 3. THe manner how to make this plaister, and also her vertue, is described in the third Part, and the eleuenth Chapter. Basilicon. §. 4. HEr preparation and vse is described in the fift Part, the first Chapter, and 15. §. A Plaister for the Rupture. §. 5. THere be diuers specified of these in the third Part, the third Chapter, and §. 1. The Plaister Ceroneum. §. 6. IF there be any that desire to make this plaister, he may looke for the same in Nicolao, for that it is very seldome vsed. Diachilon. §. 7. OF this Diachilon there be thrée kindes made: the common Diachilon is described in the third Part, the twentieth Chapter, and twentieth §. The great Diachilon is found at the Apothecaries, it melloweth and ripeneth all hard swellings. The Plaister de Galbano. §. 8. HOw this plaister is made, and also her operation, is to be sought for in the Latine Table, vnder the name of Galbanum. Gratia Dei Plaister. §. 9. THat is as much to say as Gods graces Plaister. The maner to make the same is found in the fift Part, the first chapter, and 16. §. Emplastrum Griseum de Lapide Calaminari. §. 10. WE call this the gray plaister: It is also made after two waies, and it is described in the fift Part, the seuenth chapter, and 12. §. Hyssopi Cerotum, siue Philagrij. §. 11. THis Plaister is made very seldome, and vsed but thrée times in this booke. Emplastrum de Meliloto. §. 12. THis is a Plaister of the flowers of Melilot, and is made of many kindes of things: where∣fore we will pretermit her description, and whereto it is to be vsed, shall you finde here and there in this booke.
Emplastrum de Muscilaginibus. §. 13. FOr what this plaister is to be vsed, and how the same is made, that is found in th first part, the sixt Chapter, and seuenth §. Emplastrum Oxycroceum. §. 14. AFter thrée manners is this Plaister described: it hath her name of the Vineger, and of the Saffron. Of her excellent operation may you reade here and there in this Booke. Emplastrum de Pelle Arietis. §. 15. LOoke for this in the third part, the third Chapter, and first §. how highly the same is com∣mended for all manner of ruptures. Emplastrum de Radicibus. §. 16. THis plaister of rootes is but once vsed in this booke, and that in the third part, the twen∣tieth Chapter and eleuenth §. The Plaister of Saunders. §. 17. THis plaister is called at the Apothecaries, Cerotum Sandalinum, which may be made to a salue, as it is described in the third part, the eleuenth Chapter, and sixtéenth §. The blacke Plaister. §. 18. VVHereof there be two sorts described, to wit, in the first part the fourth Chapter, and second §. and in the fift part, the seuenth Chapter, and sixt §. for that they be very much vsed of the Chirurgians. Sparadropon. §. 19. THese Sparadraps are described in the fourth part, the second Chapter, and second §. Emplastrum Viride. §. 20. THis Plaister doe the Chirurgians vse much in old stinking vlcers, as the same is de∣scribed in the first part, the first Chapter, and fiftéenth §. And because that now all the Plaisters must be boyled, therefore it is taught in the first part, the fourth Chap∣ter, and third §. how to make a proofe, whereby it may be knowen, when the same are sodden enough, and must be taken from the fire. The second part of this Chapter speaketh of Pils. THe most of all compounds and mixtures of Pils, be composed togither of many things, and they be vsed but one dragme alone at one time, and not with whole or halfe ounces, as the Confections or Conserues are, wherefore it is not néed∣full for to adde their description here: and also séeing that each housholder may buy the same for a small summe of money at the Apothecaries: but we will neuertheles discouer the virtues and commodities of all the Pils, which be in this booke commemorated, and for what sicknes that they are to be vsed.

The third Part of this Chapter of Sirupes. Of the Sirupes and Iuices in generall. BOth of these things, as Sirups and Iuices, be almost innumerable that be vsed in Phisicke, to wit, the iuices of fruites, herbs, flowers, roots, and such like things, somtimes alone, but tempred for the most part alwaies with other things, according as each pleaseth, as may be discerned tho∣rough out all this Booke. Wherfore it is not our purpose to gather here together such things, but onely those which are most vsed: but we will as much as is possible, most truly expound and translate their names into English, and also adioyne therewith their operations and powers. First, you haue in the Introduction how all Iuices are to be clarified. Secondly, it is also a ge∣neral rule that no sower iuices, as the iuice of vnripe Grapes, Barberries, neither wine nor vi∣neger are to be sodden in Copper vessels, for that they may get an hurtful tast: but the same are to be decocted in earthen leaden pots. Thirdly, you haue also in the first part, the first chapter, & sixt §. how that the compounded sirupes are to be decocted. Fourthly, because that it importeth much that the sirupes be not decocted too hard, to the end they come not to candise, and that they be not sodden too thin, and come not to be moldie: wherfore the proofe also is described in the in∣troduction, wherby may certainly be vnderstood when as they be enough: like as is also suffici∣ently admonished of each sirupe that they may be clarified. Syrupus de Absinthio, that is, of Wormwood. §. 1. TAke Romish Wormwood, or if you cannot get it, then take of the common. Wormewood sixe ounces, red Roses two ounces, Indy Spica thrée dragmes, good white wine, and the iuice of Quinces, of each foure and twenty ounces, let them stéepe all together in an ear∣then pot the space of one whole night, and afterwards séeth it to the halfe: this being done, straine it, then put foure and twenty ounces of cleare Hony or Sugar vnto it, and then let it seeth to a sirupe. This sirupe is also especiall good for the stomacks, for the liuer, and for all nou∣rishing parts: it maketh appetite to meate, and helpeth to digest the meat: it is good for the fal∣ling sicknesse, it expelleth wind, and driueth out all bad humors by the vrine. In the table vn∣der the name of Wormwood is her vertue described at large. Syrupus de Acetosa, of Sorrell. §. 2. TAke the iuice of Sorrell thrée parts, Sugar two parts: let it séeth together, skumme, and clarifie it well vntill it be sufficiently decocted. This sirupe is good for all hote pestilentiall Agues: it quencheth the thirst, and the inflaming heate of the heart, and also of the stomacke, and it strengtheneth the same. Sée further in the table of the Sorrell. Syrupus Acetosus, of Vineger. §. 3. IN the third part, the 11. Chapter, and 9. § is taught how that this sirupe is to be made, and one may also reade her vse there. Syrupus acetosus compositus, also of Vineger. §. 4. How this sirupe, and also de Radicibus, is to be made, is to be séene in the third part, the 11. chapter, and 9. §. where both their operations be described. Syrupus acctosus de Cytonijs, which is of sower Quin∣ces. §. 5. HEr preparation is described in the third part, the eleuenth chapter, and sixt §.
Syrupus Acetosus Diarhodon, that is, of Vineger and Roses. §. 6. THis sirupe is very seldome vsed, but for what it is good, you may reade that in the table of the Roses. Syrupus de Acetositate Citri, of the iuice of Citrons. §. 7. TAke the iuice of Citrons, which is strained through a cloth without wringing, otherwise the iuice will be thicke when it is cold, like as pap, then teeth away this iuice, with halfe so much Sugar. This sirupe hath the same vertue of the si∣rupe of Oanges, whereof we will speake shortly, but that it is more forcible. This sirupe is made thus in Cypro, like as hereafter followeth. Take cleare iuice, Sugar halfe so much, then stop it tight, and set it in the sun. This sirupe remaineth alwaies cleare. Both these sirupes be good against all venime, but especially for the Plague and all o∣ther putrified humors: it strengtheneth the stomacke, it cooleth the heart, and all other inward parts, it quencheth thirst, it bringeth sléepe, it stayeth all vapors of the stomacke, especially if one drinke too much. Reade further in the Table of the Citrons, and their vertues. Syrupus de Agresta, of Veriuice. §. 8. FOr what Veriuice is good, and how the same is to be made, we haue taught in the first Chapter of this eight part: for the sirupe are you to take fiue ounces, short sodden and vn∣salted Veriuice, and thrée ounces and a halfe of Sugar; then let them séeth together vnto a sirupe. Syrupus de Aurantijs, of Oranges. §. 9. TAke the iuice of swéet Oranges, which is wrung thorough a cloth, and well cleansed, two parts, Sugar one part, séeth them together vnto a sirupe. This sirupe is very good for all heate caused of Cholera. Likewise it is also good in all pestilentiall Agues, and it asswageth the thirst singular well: it may also be made of sower Oranges, for that the same is much more for∣cible than that of Citrons. Syrupus de Artemisia, of Mugwoort. §. 10. THis sirupe is very troublesome to be made, wherfore we wil commend it to the Apo∣thecaries: it is very good for all diseases of the Matrix, it kéepeth it in her due place, it expelleth all wind, and all paine of the same, it strengtheneth the sinewes, it ope∣neth the pores, it maketh good bloud, and it forceth womens termes. For what pur∣poses else it may be vsed, looke in the table of Mugwoort. Syrupus de Berberis, of Barberries. §. 11. TAke Barberries which be very ripe, and let them séeth well in wine vntill that they be mellow, then wring it thorow a cloth, and boile the colature with Sugar, as before. I∣tem, take the iuice of ripe Barberries, and let it séeth apart, afterwards scum it well: when it is well cleansed, take as much Sugar as iuice, séeth it all together vnto a sirupe: her vertue is to be read in the Table of the Barberries. Syrupus de Betonica, of Betonie. §. 12. THe description of this sirupe is very long, wherefore we will pretermit it: her vertue may be adiudged by the description of the herbe Betonie in the Table. Syrupus Byzantinus. §. 13. TAke the iuice of Endiue and of Berberries, of each sixe ounces, the iuice of Hops and of Bu∣glosse, of each three ounces, seeth all together, clarifying it vntill there remaine 12. ounces,
then put seuen ounces and a halfe of Sugar vnto it, and let them séeth all together to a sirupe. This sirup maketh al the tough slimie matter to auoide, and it openeth all obstructions, wher∣fore it is all good for all yellow Iaundis, like as there be many other sirupes. Syrupus de Boragine, of Burrage. §. 14. WE haue before admonished in the fourth Chapter in the description of the Con∣serue of Burrage, that there is none, or indeed very small difference betweene the Burrage and the Buglosse: neuertheles there be made at the Apothecaries two kinds of sirupes, and commonly mixed with other medicines: wherfore is an housholder to prepare it thus. Take the iuice of both these herbes, of each 8. ounc. the iuice of both these flowers, of each one ounce, séeth the same with foure ounces of Sugar, and scum it as behooueth, and ought to be; you may also suffer the flowers to séeth in some water, and powre the iuice vnto it. This sirupe is good against all diseases of the heart, and it maketh a merry mind: and of her power you may reade further in the Register of Burrage. Syrupus de Buglossa. §. 5. OF this Sirupe is sufficiently written in this foresaid sirupe of Burrage. Syrupus de Calamintha, of field Mints. §. 16. TAke of field Mints and white water Mints, of each two ounces, the séede of Lo∣uage, of the greater Pimpernel (in stead of Dauci Cretici) and Squinant, of each fiue dragms, Raisins sixe ounces, hony 24. ounces, let them séeth all that is to seeth, scum and wring it out well; then make with hony, or with as much Su∣gar a sirupe of it. This sirupe is especiall good for a hard Spléene, and all hard intrailes, and also for an old Cough, of all old people, which be plagued with a féeble and short breath: like as you may reade further of Mints in the Table. Syrupus Capillorum Veneris, or of Maiden∣haire. §. 17. THis sirupe doth cost very much labour before the same may be made, like as we haue ad∣monished vnder the name of Maydenhayre in the Table. Syrupus de Cichorio cum Rhabarbaro, of Cicorie. §. 18. AT all Apothecaries this sirupe is very rise: it cleanseth and withstandeth all poyson, and especially the Carbuncle, and such like: it strengtheneth the hart, and al nutritiue parts: it is also good for all pestilent Agues, it expelleth all bad matter, by the stoole, and by the vrine: it causeth also appetite and sleepe. Syrupus de Cytonijs, of Quinces. §. 19. THis sirupe is like to all other sirups, made of Sugar and iuice of Quinces: you shal reade of her vertue and efficacie in the Register in the description of Quinces. There is another sirupe described before of sower Quinces, called Miua Cytoniorum. Further, there are iuices or thicke sirupes prepared vnder the name of Miua, whereof there be some described in the third Part, the eleuenth Chapter, and 17. §. Syrupus de Citro, of Citrons. §. 20. SOme do take not onely the sowernes of the Citrons, but also the iuice of the white rinds, so that not onely the outwardmost péeles and the seedes are separated: but this sirupe is not so forcible as that which is prescribed: yet they be both made and vsed in all hote sick∣nesses.
Syrupus de corticibus Citri, of Citron peeles. §. 21. TAke the outwardmost fresh péeles of Citrons, cut in small , one pound, powre thereon fiue times as much water, and let it séethe to the halfe: then wring it through a cloth, afterwards put a pound of Sugar vnto it. When it is almost sodden to a sirupe, then put fower graines of Muske vnto it, broken in Rose wa∣ter. This sirupe cooleth not like the former, but it warmeth and strengtheneth the hart, the braines, all inward parts, and the vitall spirits. It strengtheneth the weake stomacke, maketh a good breath, and defendeth from the Plague &c. Syrupus de Cucurbita, of Gourds. §. 22. THis sirupe is seldome vsed, and in this booke but onely in two places. Syrupus de Endiuia, of Endiue. §. 23. OF this herbe be many sundry sirupes made. That which is called Simplex, is made thus: take the iuice of greene Endiue one pound, and when it is clarified through seething, then put ten ounces of Sugar vnto it, seethe it away, like as all other si∣rupes be. This sirupe is good against all inward heate of the Liuer, and other nu∣tritiue parts, it is vsed for many kinds of things, as may be séene in the Register. Syrupus de Epithymo. §. 24. AT all well furnished Apothecaries this sirupe is rife, whereas the same is to be fetched: it expelleth the burnt cholericke humors, it doth therefore withstand all sicknesses which spring or come thereof, viz. the Leprosie, Canker, bad vlcers, and Fistulaes: like as his name shall shew in the Table. Syrupus de Eupatoria, of Agrymonie. §. 25. THe opinion of many learned men is, that our Agrymony is the true Eupatorium: Of this is also a sirupe made, which is very troublesome to be made: wherefore we will not de∣scribe the same here. It hath a speciall power for to helpe the cold and obstructed liuer, to expell all Dropsies and such like sicknesses, for to make all grosse slime thin, and to strengthen the liuer: it also moneth vrine. Looke further of her virtue in the Table of Agrymony. Syrupus de fumo Terrae, of Fumitorie. §. 26. TAke the iuice of Fumitory, and of the sprouts of Hops, of each one pound, clarifie it and temper it like as we haue taught, and then decoct it vnto a sirupe with one pound of Sugar. At the Apothecaries there is an other made of many sundry things, which here we will not describe. These sirupes be both good for to open all obstructions of the stomacke, and of the liuer; for to strengthen the same also, and to cleanse the blood, that thereby all scabbednes, all had sores, and such like accidents may be suppressed, and auoided. Wherefore they be also good against the Pocks, against all old vlcers, Leprosie, and other such like diseases. moe. Syrupus de Glycyrriza, of Licorice. §. 27. THe common people do make this sirupe thus: Take a pound of small sliced Licorice, and powre thereon two pots of water: afterwards let it seethe so long, vntill the vertue come out: then straine it, and put to this decoction one ounce of Dragagant, and let it séethe togither vntill it be thicke enough. This sirupe is very good for the Cough, and for all toughnes of the brest. But this following is the right sirupe of Licorice: Take small sliced Licorice one ounce, Maydenhaire halfe an ounce, Hyssope one quarter of an ounce, put a quarte of water
vnto it, and let it all togither infuse the space of fower and twentie howers; afterwards put vnto it ere Hony, Sugar pennets, and white Sugar, of each fower ounces, Rose water three ounces seethe it togither vnto a sirupe. This sirupe clenseth the breast, and the lights, it is very good for all cold coughes, and also for the pleurisie, as you may reade in the table of Licorice. Syrupus Granatorum, of Pomegranates. §. 28. IT is a great abuse to wring out the sower and swéete Pomegranates togither, by reason that the sower and the swéete each a part are méete for sundrie disea∣ses, but the foresaid mixture we will leaue alone for Cookerie: thus, take two quarts of Pomegranates wine, and seethe it so long vntill it be well clarified, then temper amongst it halfe a pound of Sugar, and so set it in the sunne vntill it come to worke, and then afterwards preserue it in a sellar. And for to write a part of the sowre Pomegranates: Take thereof fiue pound of the iuice, and white Sugar three pound, seethe it togither to a sirupe skumming it alwaies about. This sirupe is verie forcible in all hot agues which be caused of Cholera. The sirupe of swéete Pomegranates is prepared in all sorts as the former, like as the same is taught in the table at large of the Pomegranates, and euerie one may direct himselfe accor∣dingly. Syrupus de Hyssopo, of Hyssop. §. 29. YOu must take dry Hyssop, the rootes of Smallage, of Fennell, Parsley, and of Licorice, of each fiue dragmes, peeled Barley one quarter of an ounce, the séede of Mallowes, of Quince kernels, and Dragagant, of each one dragme and a halfe, Mayden haire three dragmes, Iuiubes, and Sebestes, of each fourteene or fiftéene, Currans thrée quarters of an ounce, Figs, and Dates, of each fiue or sixe, Sugar pennets twelue ounces, then make a sirupe thereof. This sirupe is verie forcible for all the diseases of the breast, and of the lights: it causeth all tough slime to a∣uoide which may hardly be coughed vp, like as shall be more at large taught thereof in the English Register, vnder the name of Hyssop. Syrupus de Ireos, of Ireas. §. 30. THis sirupe is made, as in the third Part, the tenth chapter, and ninth §. is taught, where∣as it is ordained against the dropsie Tympanites, like as also the table vnder the name of Ireos doth giue to vnderstand. Syrupus de Iuiubis. §. 31.

The same sirupe is good against all hoarsnes, a∣gainst the cough, and against the pleurisie; and also to other diseases moe, like as the table doth expresse. Syrupus de Limonibus, of Limons. §. 32. THis sirupe is made of fresh Limons, euen as the sirupe of Oranges is made; but it is far stronger then the sirupe of Citrons, like as the same may be seene in the register vnder the name of Limons.
Syrupus de Lupulo, of Hops. §. 33. TAke the iuice of the sprigs of yong Hops one pound, and th of Fumitory halfe a pound, which be both very cleare decocted, and skimmed, afterwards séethe them with a pound and a halfe of Sugar vnto a sirupe. The iuice of Hops may also be taken alone. This sirupe cooleth much, it expelleth the yel∣low Iaundise: moreouer all slimines and also the Dropsie through the stoole, and is also good for all other things, like as is sufficiently declared vnder the name of Hops in the Table. Syrupus de Menta, of Mints. §. 34. THere be two kinds of Sirups of Mints, as the same and also their virtues are described in the third part the eleuenth Chapter and 17. §. where it is also admonished, that it is especiall méete for the Laxe. For what causes moe the same is profitable, that may you reade in the Table vnder the name of Mints. Syrupus de Myrto, of Mirtle seede. §. 35. IN the third part the eleuenth Chapter and 17. §. is this Sirupe also specified, which is very commodious for many things, like as you may reade in the Table. Syrupus de Nymphaea, of water Lillies. §. 36. TAke of the white leaues of waterlilly floures one pound, let them waume vp in water, afterwards wring them hard out through a cloth, and then séethe this de∣coction skumming it, with a pound of Sugar to a sirupe. This sirupe is very méetely vsed for all hot sicknesses, like as before is taught in the fourth Chapter and 39. §. It moysteneth, it cooleth, and furthereth sléepe. Another, which is com∣monly prepared at all Apothecaries: Take the leaues of white water Lillies one ounce, yellow water Lillies halfe an ounce, seedes of Fleawort and of Sorrell, of each halfe an ounce, the séedes of Melons, of Citruls, of Gourds, and of Cucumbers (all together peeled) of each one quarter of an ounce; the séede of Lettice, of Endiue, of small Endiue, and of Purslaine, of each one dragme, Fennell rootes halfe an ounce: shred it all together very small, and let it seethe in Barly water: afterwards strayne it thorow, and wring it out hard. Now being clarified, then put sixe ounces of white Sugar vnto it, Vineger and the iuice of sowre Pomegranates, of each one ounce, then let them séethe all together againe vnto a sirupe, at last temper yellow Saun∣ders with it, and Indy Spica, of each two scruples. This sirupe doth maruellous much with∣stand the hot Cholera, and besides all hot Agues, and procureth also sleepe: it is also to be vsed for moe other things, like as the Table vnder the name of water Lillies doth set forth. Syrupus de Papauere, of Poppie heads. §. 37. THere be two kindes of these sirupes made, the one called Compositum, is thus made: Take black and white Poppie heads which be very fresh, of each 25. dragmes, Mayden haire seuen dragmes and a halfe, Licorice 22. dragmes, Iuiubes fiftéene dragmes, Let∣tice séede two ounces and a halfe, Mallowes séede and Quince kernels, of each thrée dragmes, séethe them all together in a pot of water euen to the halfe: afterwards wring it out, and séethe this decoction againe with Sugar and sugar Pennets, of each foure ounces vnto a sirupe.

THis sirupe is very seldome vsed, and besides made with greater trouble; it is also vsed but once, to wit, in the obstruction of the Pyles: it is made onely of the iuice like as all other sirupes. Syrupus de Pomis, of Apples. §. 40.

Make first a milde fire, and so a little stronger and stronger: and whē the fume in the glasse receiuer beginneth to be red, then giue it a stronger fire; and when the rednes beginneth to be gone, then draw out the fire and let it be cold, then keepe it stopt very close. Although not onely the Chirurgians, but also the Goldsmiths, and other moe do vse this water: yet it is neuertheles very good against the paine of the teeth, but it must be wisely taken in hand, or else must be wholly omitted the Quicksiluer whereof the powder precipitate is made, and also is calcined with it. Species Berchtoldi. §. 45.

The 16. Chapter. IN this Chapter be certaine Potions described, as also certaine powders for meate, and Trociskes, which here and there be ordayned in this present practise of Phisicke: wherefore we will first begin with the Potions. Decoctiones Aperitiuae, Potions that do deobstruct. §. 1. THere be some of these described in the third Part the eleuenth Chapter, and twentieth §. viz. called the common, and with Rubarbe, which be verie necessary for to keepe an open bodie: notwithstanding that one may vse the same commonly, for to mixe other Confections with it. Decoctio Epithymi, of Dodder. §. 2. THis Potion is prepared as it is described in the first Part, the twelfth Chapter, and eighth §. viz. in thrée kindes of wayes. Her operation may you reade in the Register vnder the name of Dodder. Decoctio fructuum, a Potion of certaine fruits. §. 3. THis Potion is described in the third Part, the third chapter, and fift §. where we do speake and discourse of the Rupture. Decoctio pectoralis, The pectorall Potion. §. 4. THis Potion is very good for all them which haue a short breath, for the Cough, and for the rheume, whereof there be two discouered in the second Part, the 2. chapter, and 2. §. and in the second Part, the 5. chapter, and 5. §. For what the same is further vsed, is to be found in the Register, vnder the name of a pectorall potion. Decoctio & infusio Senae, A potion of Sene leaues. §. 5. THis Potion is described in the third Part, the eleuenth chapter, and 20. §. where it is or∣dained for the obstruction of the belly, as the Register doth witnesse the same, vnder the name of Sene leaues. A water of Mans blood. §. 6. AFter the discourse of these foresaid potions, I cannot pretermit to adioine with this a new inuention, whereof some princes haue very great estimation, and haue also vsed otherwhiles for to remaine thereby in their force, and to liue long (as they thought) which was this, viz. that one should chuse a yoong strong man, which was as yet in his flourishing youth, like as of 25. yeres, which was somewhat cholericke by nature: the same is to be fed the space of one moneth, and be well dyeted with light & healthie meates, also with all kinds of spices, and with good strong wine, who also is to be kept with mirth: this being so done, then are both his vaines to be opened in his armes, and so much blood to be let out as he may tolerate and abide; and vnto sixe pound of blood mixe one handfull of salt: then put these togither in a glasse body, stopt well and tight, and set it a whole moneth in horse dung, yet euery eight daies in fresh horse dung: afterwards distill this blood in ashes, when the water is distilled out of it, then powre it againe in ye body, by all that which remained therein, to the end it may be soft againe, and in this manner distill it seuen times togither. Other be of opinion, that as often as it is di∣stilled, that then it is to be set againe in horse dung. Some suppose that it ought to be but thrée
times distilled, and that at the most: put the dry feces into a Retorte, and distill it with mode∣rate fire and then will it yéeld a stinking oyle. Afterwards powre oftentimes water vnto it, and distill this oyle as many times with the water, vntill it loose her sauour or stench. This water is to be giuen in three or fower times a yéere, each time one ounce; but not aboue three or fower drops of the oyle. Each one may beléeue this as far as he will. Concerning all other drinks, as Béere, Claret wine, Aromaticall wines, Barley water, Iuleps, Almond milke, Meade, and such like: of them we haue written elsewhere. In the end of this booke we will admonish and discourse of moe other herbed wines. The second Part of this Chapter, of certaine powders for Meate. WE will not here admonish of any powders, which be seruiceable & méete for any sicknesses: but we will only speake of them that are vsed for plea∣sure, and for to warme the stomacke, or that may be strowed vpon wine sops, as this ensuing: Take elected Cinnamome one ounce and a halfe, Ginger thrée ounces, Greines and Pepper, of each one dragme and a halfe, Nutmegs, Cloues, and Mace, of each thrée drag. poune all verie small togither, Sugar as much as you please, and according as that you desire to haue it strong.

Thyme, Annis, and Ginger, of each fiue greines, Sugar fiue ounces, then temper them altogither. This is speciall good for all cold stomacks. The third part of this Chapter, of Trociskes. TRociscus is a Gréeke name, and is as much to say as a round shiue, or round Cake, like as these Trocisci be made: but the Apothecaries doe commonly make them now adayes fower square, and about the waight of one dragme, which is of small importance. These Trociskes be made diuersly, whereof be many mentioned in this our booke: whereof wée will onely describe the name and force of them that be too troublesome to make, to the end the same may be asked for at the Apothecaries, when there is vse for them.

They be very much vsed, for that they be forcible a∣gainst spetting of blood if the same be giuen with the water of Knotgrasse: they be also good against the bleeding at the nose if the same be annoynted on the forehead; and also for womens flowers if they passe away too excessiue fast: likewise for the bléeding of the pyles, and for pissing of blood, if it be spouted into the yarde, like as the same is mentio∣ned in the Register vnder the title of sealed Earth. Trocisci de Violis, of Violets. §. 24. YOu must take Violet leaues which be somewhat withered one ounce and a half, Turbith one ounce, the iuice of Licorice, Manna, and Diagridion, of each halfe an ounce; make Trocisks thereof with the sirupe of Violets. They are very sel∣dome vsed alone, but sharpned with thrée greines, or with any other pils if they be giuen to any bodie that is hard to be purged. They are made also without Diagridio, and they be also otherwhiles mixed with some other Trocisks: looke further for it in the Register of Violets. For to make writing Incke. §. 25. WE must not pretermit ye description of this Incke (being a necessarie matter.) It is also made in sundrie manners; but this is the commonest manner for to make Incke: Take pouned Gall nuts one pound, Coperas halfe a pound, raine water fiue quarts; seeth them all togither vntill the third part be wasted, then let it settle, afterwards straine it thorow a cloth: put foure ounces of Gum vnto it, and then stir it oftentimes about. Some do not boyle it but let it stand and stéepe, stirring it very often and well: but take for it no more but thrée quarts of water, and let the Gum be first dissolued in good wine Vineger vntill it be all dissolued, and then put the other substance vnto it, & thus it is also best of all & doth remaine alwaies without moulding. For to make common Vernish. §. 26. VErnish is made after sundry waies, and there are also sundry sorts of them, each for an especiall vse: the one is made thus, and the other so. But we will here describe onely and teach how that it shall be most fitly made, and for what it shall be requisite for each
one. First take olde Linséed oyle, and séethe it so long vntill it be as thicke that if you do take a drop of it out, and let it be cold, when you presse vpon it with your finger it spinneth two or three threads, or glueth to the finger. This oyle being now so sodden, put Rosin vnto it as much as shall suffice for to make the Vernish thicke enough: then let the Rosin decoct to∣gither with the oyle so long vntill it do stand wholly still. This Vernish is good for the Smithes, for the Trencher-makers, for the Trunck-makers; and further for to Vernish all slight things. Of Painters Vernish. §. 27. TAke olde Linséed oyle and séethe the same as is aforesaid; afterwards put a∣mongst one pound of the oyle, halfe a pound of Masticke or somewhat more, and so let it séethe togither a good while. This being done, then set it in the sunne, in a leaden Basen, and power one part of water vpon it, and stirre it well togither; then will the oyle come vpon the top, and let it stand so clari∣fying in the sunne and ayre the space of two or thrée moneths. But it is to be noted that you must alwaies take good héede of the faire weather, and of the raine, and also of the night: for if so be that it did raine, then would your oyle run ouer and so you léese the same: wherefore must you haue alwaies ready a boord or plancke for to couer the same oyle, as well from the raine, as from the night, vpon aduenture least that it should raine at night, &c. You may make also a faire Vernish of the oyle alone, to wit, through the seething it away, and then let it clarifie as is before said. For to make odoriferous Vernish. §. 28. FOr to make this odoriferous Vernish you are to take a new earthen pot which is well leaded, and put into it one pound of oyle of Spike, and let the same be boyling hot: afterwards you are to take halfe a pound of Sandaraca, or some∣what more, and strow the same amongst it being beaten small, alwaies with a little at once, and stirring it well about; then set this Vernish to clarifie as is said before. This Vernish dryeth very hard and with a faire glosse: it hath an especiall good sauour, and may be vsed for all things that you please. The 17. Chapter. IN this Chapter do come no compositions, but onely those which be tempered with blew Violets and wall Flowers, whereof we haue oftentimes written before, whereof each is to be found in the Regi∣ster: as the Iulep of Violets, that you shall finde in the third Part, the twelfth Chapter & tenth §. The sirupe of Violets in the fiftéenth Chap∣ter, and 53. §. The Conserue before in the fourth Chapter. The oyle of Violets in the twelfth Chapter, and 69. §. viz. in this eight Part. The Vineger of Violets is made, like as the Vineger of Roses is woont to be made. The 18. Chapter. Of all kindes of VVines. IN this Chapter be all Wines contained, which be made with any kinde of Herbs, and such like things, viz. all such as may be accounted amongst the Phisicall reme∣dies: and bicause they are commonly prepared with Wine or Must, therefore we will write first of them, and that in the briefest sort: for that to write of all kind of Wines were a matter without end.
Of Wine in generall. §. 1. IT is most true, that this noble Plant is made of God for diuers necessities of mankind, notwithstanding that man doth dayly abuse this noble gift of God so shamefully, and so in stead of doing good thereby, harmeth his body, and pro∣uoketh sicknes, wherefore we must discourse and treate somewhat of both these things. In this do all learned agrée, and dayly experience doth teach vs, that Wine is so commodious & necessarie for mans life, and for his health, that there can no better drinke be deuised. Moreouer, it withstandeth all poison, and is especiall good for all sorenes of the Kid∣neyes, and for all paine of the Bladder. But especially sowre wine strengtheneth the stomack: further, it doth prouoke digestion, it sustaineth naturall power, it strengtheneth all inward and outward parts, it kéepeth a body with a good colour, it maketh fresh and healthie bloud, it ma∣keth the languishing merry, the dismayd couragious, it carieth the well digested meate into the inward parts, it consumeth the slimy humors, it strengtheneth and dryeth the braines, it refre∣sheth the hart, it sharpneth the wits and the vnderstanding, wherefore it is of the heathen en∣dued with a godly name, and is called Liber, that is frée. Further, it bringeth with it the plea∣sant sléepe, it prouoketh venery, and maketh women fruitfull. In fine, Wine hath so many ver∣tues, that Asclepiades said, That the power of wine may well be compared with the Gods. Esdras doth write (which I cannot pretermit) that Wine is stronger than men that drinke it, that it altereth the wits, that it maketh Kings, wise, poore, and ritch men, it assureth and sharp∣neth the vnderstanding, it causeth all paine to be forgotten, it satisfyeth all concupiscence, it careth neither for King, nor Princes, and it vttereth all that it listeth and pleaseth. These be now the commodities and auailes which Wine can bring with it. But what shall I say to the contrary of those things which it doth if it be superfluously vsed, but we haue ynough spoken thereof in the sixt part and eightéene Chapter, where we discourse of the Plague; but we will procéede with those things that are more fit for our purpose. We haue before admonished, that there can no more commodious nor healthier potion be found for mans nature than wine, and of all other are best the faire, cleane, light red, and they that haue colour like Geese féete. But for to haue a full and perfect instruction of wine, and for what Sicknes each wine is prescribed or forbidden, that is to be seene in the table of the Vine. In like manner, there is also found héere a perfect instruction of Must, of vine cuict, and of spirit of wine; also of vineger, and for what the same is good within and without, and for what it is also hurtfull. Lastly, we will describe sundry herbed wines, to wit, how that they be made, and also what operation they haue. Of sundry natures of Wine. §. 2. IT is also very néedefull, that one do know the nature of wine, for that some of them do alter their nature, according as they be yong, old, white, red, thick, subtile, small or strong. The white wine is warme in the first degrée: the very old wine in the third degree: but the wine of a yéere old kéepeth the middle meane. The thick red wine maketh much bloud, because it néedeth no great alteration, but the thin, white, and sowre wine, giueth little nourishment. The thick and troubled wine obstructeth the belly, the Lyuer, the Spléene, and the Kidneyes, so that all they which vse the same too much, are woont to be troubled with the Dropsie and Grauell, and especially the old folks. Out of this may each one choose such wines which be most méete for him. Of Must. §. 3. THe wine which we call Must, that is new wine, which is first prest out, and not long cellered, and hath not as yet wrought thorowly, like as the same is knowne vnto all men: this Must hath his proper nature, but there is almost no Must which doth any good, but many that are hurtfull. But Must is commonly vsed when one will make any herbed wines.
Of vine cuict, or decocted wine. §. 4. THe Phisitions do call this wine Sapam, it is commonly decocted so long of Must and o∣ther strong wyne, vntill that of thrée quarts there remaine but one. This decocted wine is vsed in Phisick very much inwardly and outwardly. Of burnt wine. §. 5. THe burnt wyne is for the most part burnt of the drosse, or léese of wyne, which is not vsed so much for Phisick, as that which is distilled of cleare wyne, and is rectifyed two or three times ouer againe. Of Vineger. §. 6. THat Vineger is made of sowre wyne, is apparant to euery bodie. It is also a maruel∣lous worke of nature that it spoyleth wyne, and altereth it out of his naturall course, and maketh some other thing thereof, which is a thing by it selfe, and vsed as well in Cookerie as for Phisick, which is no lesse pleasant than wyne it selfe. For Dioscorides, and o∣ther mo learned ascribed to vineger many innumerable vertues, like as we find by dayly expe∣rience, therefore is also the red as well as the white vineger ordained in Phisick for many kind of causes, as it is also in some diseases forbidden. The leese of the vineger is also otherwhiles mentioned in this booke. The nineteenth Chapter. Of Herbed wines and such like. FIrst, we will teach héere how this Wine is héere to be prepared, the which is effected after sundry manners, and as liketh each one best. The common manner is, that the herbs are to be gathered betwéene the mid∣dest of August, and middest of September: but the fittest time is, when they beare their floures. These herbs are to be dryed in the shadow, or at least in a luke warme Chamber where it doth not dust, vntill you will vse the same. If now you will make any Herbed wyne, then take a small vessell as big as you will, and put therein Beechen or hasell chips into it, strow vpon it a good deale of dryed herbs, without wringing, and afterwards one part of chips againe & herbs: do this so long vntill that all the whole vessell be full, and after∣wards fill it with Must. If so be that it be strong, then may you drinke of it the sooner, and fill it full againe. But to procure further aduise therof, therfore we will adde vnto this how to make other sorts of herbed wines. If one will kéepe these wines swéete, then is one part of the Must to be decocted away with a light fire, and that according as the Must is strong, or thin. Other do prepare their herbed wines by a certaine distillation with such herbs as they will them∣selues, so that they keepe their smell, power, and vertue, that if so be that one put but two or thrée drops of it into a quart of wine, that then all the wine wil taste of it, so that thereby many expences, labor and trauell is spared. But because that such experiments be not knowne vnto all men, therefore may they vse these things following: Take such herbs as you will, whether they be floures or rootes, which be very dry, poune them, and powre vpon them good burnt wine: afterwards stop it tight, and let it stand so astéepe the space of certaine dayes; afterwards strayne them out thorow a cloth, and then preserue it in a glasse. When as then you will haue such wine, then powre thereof whether it be much or little into it; and if so be that you haue no burnt wine, then take good old strong wine in stead thereof. But excepting the boyling or distil∣ling  it, the wine it selfe is of that nature, that very shortly it draweth to it the power, smatch, sauor, and vertue of those things which are infused therein. Some suppose, that one must cast into the vessell only the herbs, rootes, séeds, floures, or any thing else that one will, and to powre new Must vpon it, whether it be much or little, according to that the wine or any thing that is
in it be strong or weake. Other do cast the rootes, herbes, and other things in it when he wine is a yeare old. Some do take the herbes or rootes &c. greene: some drie. Some do shred the herbes: some do stamp them to powder, and so hang them in a bag. Each may take out of this which li∣keth him best. Let this suffice for the making of the wines. Wine of Elecampane rootes. §. 1. THis wine is prepared after diuers sorts, but the best maner is which also néedeth not much trouble, as hereafter followeth: Take Must first troden out of the Grapes, and let it séeth without any smoke about it euen to the halfe it that you desire to haue it swéete. In this you are to séeth Elecampane rootes which be digged vp in the spring time, and cut into slices, and dried on a thréed. Seeth them so long in it vntill they haue lost all their bitter taste: and if one will often vse this wine, then are the rootes so much the oftener to be sod with new wine, that the wine may abide by his power, and the vessell is alwayes to be filled vp againe with wine. This is a very profitable potion for the head and the braines; in like maner also for to warme and strengthen the sinewes if the same be vexed with rheumes. This wine is also good against al cold diseases of the lights & of the brest, it clenseth the same, it strengtheneth all bad digestiue stomacks, it refresheth naturall warmth, it warmeth the sinews, it openeth the passages of vrine, it is good against all winds, it strengtheneth the Matrix, and it clenseth the same of all cold phlegmaticke moisture, and it prouoketh also the termes. Eyebright wine. §. 2. THis wine is made of the herbe, as we haue taught before, his vertues are described in the first part, the seuenth Chapter, and 20. §. and in other places moe. Wine of whole Grapes. §. 3. IF one will make this wine as it ought to be, then take whole red or white Grapes taken from the stalkes and well clensed, and put them into a vessell with chips (as we haue taught before) fill the white with white Must, or with Ferne wine, and the red with red wine. Some do boile it in Must, and that according to each ones pleasure, as also some there be which put no chips vnto it, but they do put Sage leaues vnto it, and let them lie a certaine time in it. There be spices also wont to be hanged therein, so that the wine may get thereby not onely a pleasant, but also a strong and good taste. These wines are first of all very commodious for all hosts and householders, so that all that which remaineth of other wines, and is not drunken, may be powred vnto it. Such wines be very acceptable, but if one do drinke too much thereof, then do they hurt the head, for they do di∣stemper the braines, and that chiefly in the euening after supper, for that they be much subtiler, and more ascending than other wines: they make a bodie quickly very sleepie, they prouoke vo∣miting against euening, but in the morning they make merry: and amongst all other there be none that hurt the braines more than this, wherefore they are both drunken more for lust and pleasure than for commoditie of health. Wine of Auence. §. 4. THese odoriferous rootes do the Apothecaries and Phisitions call Garyophillata, the same is to be digged vp in the spring time, but chiefly in March, in which time the rootes be most forcible: let these rootes drie well, and when they be cleansed, then hang them afterwards in the wine, it will get thereby a very pleasant fauour and taste, which refresheth the heart and strengtheneth: it openeth the obstruction of the liuer, warmeth the cold and moist braines, drieth and strengtheneth the cold slimie stomake, it asswageth also all paine of the Matrix. Betonie wine. §. 5. THis Wine is made of browne Betonie, as all other herbed wines be: it is especiall good against all belching and wambling of the stomacke, it withstandeth the ouerflowing of the gall, it is many times approoued in a cold Matrix, and against all suffocation of the same,
it strengtheneth all inward parts, it warmeth and healeth also the same, it openeth the obstructi∣ons, it consumeth all cold humors, it expelleth all venemous matter by the vrine & by the stoole, and in like manner also the yellow Iaundise: and if the same be oftentimes vsed, then it is very requisite against the falling sicknesse, against the Sciatica, against the sicknesse of the lights, and against the Consumption: It is also very necessary against the cough, against short breath, and it expelleth also all agues which do come out of a foule stomacke. The same power haue the red Gilloflowers, like as the same be also a kind of Betonie, whereof hereafter we will speake fur∣ther. This wines vse and operation you shall find described in other places moe. Burrage wine. §. 6. WE haue admonished before of the description of the Conserue and Sirupe of Bur∣rage, how there is small difference betwéene this herbe and the Buglosse, where∣fore also both these herbes may be taken for this wine, like as we haue taught be∣fore, or the iuice of the same may also well be vsed with this wine, which wine doth driue away all poyson from the heart, it cleanseth the blood, it maketh merry, it refresheth the vitall spirit, it driueth away all pensiuenesse and all bad thoughts, it is also very necessary for all them which do fall easily into any swouning, and is of a full temperate nature, &c. Wine of Asarabacca. §. 7. THis wine and other moe be prepared against the grauell, like as in the third part, the 17. Chapter, and 4. §. is described, and you shall further find in other places moe for what it is more commodious. Wine of Framboyes. §. 8. THis wine is made like as the wine of the whole Grapes is made, it hath the nature of the same berries, it is much commended in the Plague and Squinancie, but if one put none other wine vnto it, then is it not very pleasant, wherefore it is not commaunded to be vsed in any other places of this booke. Wine of Harts toong. §. 9. THere be two kindes of Harts toongs, viz. the Ceterach, which is the right Harts toong, and the long Harts toong, which is hairie about the stalkes, they may be taken both toge∣ther, and to make this wine as all other wines: it is not very pleasant of taste, but it is of great force, for that it openeth and strengtheneth the Spléene, it is good against all poyson of Snakes, and being drunke warme, it asswageth all crampes and scowring of the belly, it taketh away the yellow Iaundise, and also obstructions of the liuer: it is also very good for all them which be vexed with the stone and with the grauell: it is also good against all melancholy, and expel∣leth the quartaine Ague, it consumeth all clotted blood which is caused in the brest through fals, it openeth also the conduits of vrine, and healeth all diseases of the same. For what this wine is further meete, that is to be found described in other places of this booke. Wine of Hyssope. §. 10. THis herbe is hot and drie by nature, which vertue the wine also hath, wherefore it is good for all old persons, for it warmeth all inward parts, it asswageth the cold and moist cough: it is also good against the falling sicknesse, for when the same is vsed often and long, then doth it take away the same, and that especially in yong folkes. It is also good for the breast and the lights, for it warmeth the same, and consumeth all tough slimie matter, and also all agues which may spring out of the same: it openeth the pipes of the lights, and it maketh a cleere voice, for it cleanseth the breast, and healeth all anguishes of the same: it taketh away the shortnesse of breath, and is especiall good against the Dropsie, like as is admonished and described in moe other places of this booke.
Winter Cherrie wine. §. 11. THis wine is also made like as the wine of whole Grapes, it is very much vsed against the stone, the grauell, and is also especiall good for all them which can hardly make water. Cherrie wine. §. 12. VPon the riuer of Rhene, and euery where else, all wines which be made of red or blacke Cherries, are called Cherrie wines, and they make the same as hereafter followeth. Plucke the Cherries from the stalkes, and poune them in a stone morter with stones and all, and then poure red or white wine vpon it: but this wine will be very small, wherefore it is prepared after another maner with whole Cherries as followeth: Lay in a vessell of béechen or hasell chips as many as you please, and then one part of Cherries vpon it, and so further vntill it be full, like as we haue said and taught of the wine of Grapes, fill then the vessell ful of wine, and so let it lie thrée or foure dayes, then shall it be sufficiently coloured. This wine is of a good tempered nature, is very requisite in sommer time in great heat for to asswage therwith thirst, & to moisten the inward parts. It openeth also the liuer, it expelleth vrine, especially if the kernels with the stones be broken in it, for these kernels expel the grauell. Some do hang spices therein, which cannot be good, because his nature is altered therby. Looke into the table of the Cherries. Lauender wine. §. 13. THere is but little made at once thereof in a small vessel, whereof may not be drunken long. There is a long bagge hanged in it with Lauender flowers, and interbastated or quilted. to the end that not all the flowers fall in a heape. This wine is especiall good for a colde head, and for moist braines, for the giddinesse, for the falling sicknesse, and such like diseases. Of Malmsey. §. 14. ALbeit that this wine be tempered neither with herbes nor with spices, but by nature, and of it selfe is a noble and pleasant wine, which is brought vnto vs out of Grecia, and other countries adiacent, yet shal it neuerthelesse not be against our purpose, because that the same is very much vsed in Phisicke, that his power and vertue be shewed at this present, looke for it in the second part, in the sixt chapter; and in the third part, the 11. chapter, and 14. §. Wine of Marierom. §. 15. THis wine is prepared as all other herbed wines are, it strengtheneth the braines, and war∣meth all inward parts: it is very good for all them which be inclined to the dropsie, it asswa∣geth the paine of the belly, it expelleth vrine, and moueth womens termes: it is a very good po∣tion for to warme the head, and to strengthen the memorie, as you find described in diuers pla∣ces of this booke. Wine of Cinnamome. §. 16. THis aromaticall wine is so called and placed amongst Claret wine, whereof we haue admonished before in the eighth part in the third Chapter. This Wine is to be prepared in the haruest, and will kéepe good throughout the whole yeare; it hath all the vertues of Hypocrasse: Take one and a halfe, or two barrels of Must, séeth the same as we haue taught of the wine of Elecampane rootes, when it is cold, then put it into a cleane vessell, and put thereto as many whole Grapes pluckt from the stalke as will go into the third part of the vessell: afterwards make a linnen bagge, and put therein two pound of Cinnamome, Ginger one ounce, Galingall one ounce and a halfe, Pepper and Greines, of each halfe an ounce, Cloues and Nutmegs, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cucubes, Cardamome and long Pepper, of each one dragme, Mace thrée dragmes, powne all grosse, and hang these herbes in it. This
Cinnamome wine may be vsed for all cold diseases of the head, as all other Aromaticall wines are to be sed. Item, for all cold and vnfruitfull women: but to the contrary, all yong and hote peopl and all they that be burthened with hot Agues, must shun this wine as poyson. Of this foresaid wine is admonished in many places of this booke. Muscadell wine. §. 17. THis wine groweth in Candie, from whence it is brought to Venice, and brought thence vn∣to vs, and is often vsed in Phisicke, like as is admonished in many places. Wine of Gilloflowers. §. 18. THis wine is made of red Gillofer flowers, and made after the same maner as the wine of Betonie is made, which hath also the same force, like as both of these herbes taken to be of one efficacie, and is commended in sundrie places of this booke. Wine of Buglosse. §. 19. LOoke for it before in the sixt §. of the wine of Burrage. Wine that purgeth. §. 20. THese purging wines be made after many kindes of wayes, like as you find them described in their places, whereof you haue one for an example in the third part, the eleuenth Chap∣ter, in the end of the twentith §. which may be vsed for a common opening of the body. Wine of whole Grapes. §. 21. IT is before described in the third §. wherefore we will not here discourse any further there∣of. Vinum Punicum. §. 22. THis is no artificial wine, but it is a wine which is of it self so growne without the addition of any thing vnto it. It is very healthy, and also good of taste. The same is drunken in Ger∣manie, not onely at great feasts, but also vsed for Phisicke, like as is sufficiently admonished thereof in the Table. Rosemary wine. §. 23. THis Rosemary wine is maruellous much commended, and taken for a very wholesome potion, especially in al cold sicknesses. It strengtheneth the digestiue vertue of the stomack, it causeth appetite, it fortifieth the heart, the braines, and the sinewes, it giueth a faire pleasant colour, not only drunken, but also the face washed therewith, it consumeth all inward putrified humors, and it preserueth the body from all sicknesse. If the mouth be often washed therewith, then doth it make a well sauouring breath, it strengtheneth the teeth and the flesh of the téeth: wherefore it is also very good that all outward vlcers, viz. the Canker, fresh wounds, and such like sores be washed therewith. Further, this wine is good for all diseases of the lights, for the consumption, and especially for all them that are rheumaticke, and moyst of braines. It is also good against the Palsie, against the falling sicknesse, against the lamenesse, and against the cold Matrix, it heateth and drieth the same, and maketh it also méete for conception. Thus if this wine must be made in haste, and not be kept long, then may you take Rosemary flowers, Harts toong, and also rindes of Thamariske, of each halfe a handfull, then poure vpon it seuen pots of Must, and then let it so stand and worke or runne ouer, and fill vp the vessell alwayes with other good wine. Item, take Rosemary and Harts toong, lay it all a night to stéepe in wine, and then vse this wine in stead of the foresaid wine if the same cannot be gotten: his vertue and power is described in many sundrie places.
Wine of Sage. §. 24. THis wine doth heale all sorenesse of the mouth, it setteth fast the téeth and also the gums, it strengtheneth the sinewes and all lame ioynts, it drieth the moist braines which are hurt through Phlegma, it fréeth from the crampe, trembling and shaking, and also from the falling sicknesse, the same being drunken, and the liuer annointed therewith, or the hot va∣por thereof receiued; for what it is further méet, that is admonished here and there in this booke. Wine of Clarie. §. 25. THe deceitfull falsifiers of wine haue made this precious herbe (which is a species of wild Sage) very suspicious, so that it is estéemed hurtfull: but it is in truth not so, for if with this herbe (as with all other herbes) the wine be prepared, then is it very fit for the head and for the stomacke, for that it drieth and warmeth the colde moist braines. It is also much to be compared with the wine of Sage and of Rosemary for his vertue, and this is also the cause wherefore we make so little mention thereof in this booke. Wine of water Lilly flowers. §. 26. THis Wine is prepared very seldome, as also it is but once remembred in this booke, and that in the Consumption. Tamariske wine. §. 27. THis plant doth willingly grow in moyst places, and to this wine is alwayes vsed the mid∣dlemost rinds, it hath the same power of the wine of Harts toong, wherefore they are com∣monly vsed together, as may be séene in many places of this booke. This wine may also well be drunken for to cleanse the blood with it, and to consume melancholicke humors which do cause the quartaine Ague & the Seuruie, and such like sicknesses. What vertues this wine hath more, looke for that in the Table, in the description of the wine of Harts toong. Wine of Wormewood. §. 28. ALthough that this wine hath a bitter and vnpleasant tast, yet hath it neuerthelesse a maruellous great vertue, and is vsed aboue all other herbed wines. First of all it kil∣leth the wormes, it withstandeth poyson, and it expelleth the hurtfull phlegme; and if one drinke the same often, it clenseth and strengtheneth all inward parts that they cannot receiue such matter, it drieth the vapors of the stomack that they cannot ascend into the head, it maketh appetite, it openeth all obstructions of the inward parts, viz. of the liuer and the Spléene, and it taketh away also the yellow Iaundise which is caused therby, it fréeth from the Palsey, the falling sicknesse, and all lamenesse, it restoreth lost spéech, it strengtheneth the weakened ioynts if the same be well rubbed and fomented with it; and if mens or beasts wounds be washed with it, then is the same kept faire and cleane, and suffereth no foule flesh to grow in them, but healeth them: it cureth also all scald heads if the same be washed with it. If any one would go to sea, then is he to drinke certaine dayes before some of this Wine, for that thereby shall he be fréed of the sea sicknesse. Moreouer, this Wine is an especiall pre∣seruatiue against the Plague, and against all venemous ayre, if one take a good draught thereof before that such patients be visited, it bringeth also sléepe with it, and taketh away heauy dreames. But by reason the cōmon people haue not alwayes this wine in a readinesse, the iuice of Wormwood may be tempered amongst Wine, and be vsed in stead of the Wormewood wine. This Wine is méete for many moe other diseases, like as may be read here and there in this booke.
Wine of Zeduarie. §. 29. TAke in the beginning of winter one barrell and a halfe of Must, let it séeth softly, like as is described of Elecampane wine, afterwards put it into a cleane vessell, and then put these spices following vnto it: Take good Cinnamome one ounce, Zeduary halfe an ounce, Cloues one quarter of an ounce, Ginger, Galingall, greines and long pepper, of each one dragme, poune them all together grosse, to the end that when the power of the Zeduary is gone the spices may drie, and take out the Ze∣duary of it and put fresh vnto it: if so be that you desire to kéepe this wine long, then is the same to be filled vp with decocted wine, and not with common wine. This wine hath the same effi∣cacie and power with all aromaticall wines, and may also be vsed in stéede of them. How the infirmities of all Wines are to be amended. §. 30. WE are here not to write too largely how all the infirmities of wine are to be amen∣ded, but are to commend that to the wine sellers, by reason that thereof diuers books are written: for amendment of all wines doth serue very wel M. Tristrams water, which is described in the first part, the fift Chapter, and 1. §. In like maner also all golden and vitall waters which before in the eight part and sixt Chapter are described, if there be poured a little of them in wine which is dead or low, and stirred well a∣bout. Item, in the moneth of May you are to take a branch of a yong gréene trée, shaue off the vppermost rindes, and lay them the space of thrée dayes in fresh water: afterwards wash them well, and then poure fresh water againe vpon them. This being done, let them lie the space of thrée dayes, wash them well againe, and then drie them in the shadow. If you haue now any wine wich beginneth to be dead, then take thrée or foure of these rindes all of a length, and bind them to a thred, and hang them in the wine, it will thereby be very good and cléere. There be here and there described diuers sorts of wines, which be prepared for sundrie sick∣nesses and parts of mans bodie, viz. for the Head, for the Liuer, for the Milt, for the Heart, and for the Raines, &c. each one may looke for them in their places for which they will vse them. Herewith we will in the name of God finish this our Booke of Phisicke, and commend the same vnto our most true Father through Iesus Christ our Lord, the most true Phisition of all our diseases, that he will most graciously extend his blessings ouer it. Amen. The end of the eight and last part of this Booke.

This second Index containeth all the Simples that are specified in this Worke, as Rootes, Herbes, Flowers, Fruites, Plants, Iuices, Gummes, Woods, Stones, Barkes, Mettals, Minerals, and Earths: Also all the parts of Beasts, and of the body of man, that are or may be vsed in Physicke. A. ABrecockes or Peaches, are called in Latine Mala armeniaca, Mala praeco∣cia, and Bericocia: others do cal them mala trecacina, and the common sort name them Chrysomela, but this is the right and true Latine name of the Orange: it is a fruite sufficiently knowne, and growing in this our countrie. Adders toong, is called of Plinie Lingua, and Lingulaca, of the Herbarists Echioglossum, Ophioglossum, Lingua viperina, Lingua serpen∣tina, and Lingua vulneraria. This herbe is to be gathered onely in Aprill and in May, it groweth in moist medowes & low grounds, and that at no other time than in the aboue∣said moneths. It is vsed in vulnerall poti∣ons, oiles and salues. Alecost, or Indish pepper, in latine Lepidium, Piperitis. Alehoofe, or (as some say) Harehoofe, is called in Gréeke and in Latine Chamaecissus, Seli∣nitis, Hedera humilis, and Corona terrae, by the Herbarists Hedera pluuiatilis, and by the A∣pothecaries Hedera terrestris. Allium alpinum, it is also called Allium reticu∣latum, Victorialis, and Victorialis longa, to di∣stinguish it from Gladiolus segetalis, which by diuers authors is called Victorialis rotunda, although in very déede they differ greatly. The leafe of this herbe is not much vnlike to that of Neesewort, the roote is long and hairie, twisted together, as if it had bene done of purpose with the hand, whereof two of them are layed crosse one ouer ano∣ther, as the legges of man or woman other∣whiles are placed. This roote do the cose∣ning Merchants (I meane the Mounti∣banks and Quacksaluers) sell for the right Mandragora or Mandrake, saying, that they haue digged it vp vnder the gallowes with great hazard of their liues: thus doe they beguile and seduce the common sort of men with vntruths, which ought by the Magistrates to be seuerely punished, & not for a small peece of siluer to be permitted, o∣therwise I feare they shal be called to an ac∣count for it, when it shall be said, Redde rati∣onem villicationis tuae. Allum, Alumen, Alumen liquidum, Alumen lipari∣num, Alumen rubeum, the Apothecaries do call it Alumen de Rocha. Amber, in Latine Ambarum, Ambar, Ampar, Succinum orientale, and at the Apothecaries Ambra, it is a precious liquor, or a kinde of swéete smelling earth. Amethyst, Amethystus, a precious stone. Ammie, Ameos, Ammium, Ammi, Cuminum regiū Hippocratis, Cuminum Alexandrinum and Cu∣minum Aethiopicum, it is a kinde of plant which beareth a sharp and sweet séed, which the Apothecaris do call Ameos. Anacardus or Anacardium, is a strange fruit so called. Angelica, is called by diuers & sundrie names, for that there be diuers sorts of it, as Hippi∣atricis, Lasaron Gallaticon, in Greeke Laser Gallicum, Laserpitium Gallicum, and of the Herbarists Imperatoria, Ostrutium and A∣strutium, the Apothecaries do cal it Astrantia and Magistrantia. Anthora, is called of Paulus Aegineta, Arnabo, and of the Arabian writers Zurumbet, of the Simplicists Zurumbetum: It is a sweete smelling roote like to Ginger, but it is bitter in taste. It is commonly called Zedoaria, but vniustly: for there is no small difference betweene Zurumbet that is Anthora and Ze∣doaria of the Arabians, as manifestly ap∣peareth by the words of Auicen and Sera∣pio, who do write of these two in sundrie chapters seuerally: wherefore the Zedoaria of the Arabians is not our Anthora, although that it hath bene falsly vsed in many compo∣sitions for it, but it is the roote of Zeduarie. Anthora is an herb, not much vnlike the les∣ser Wolfs bane, but that it groweth some∣what higher, and the flowers are a little lesse and yellow. It hath two blacke rootes round like vnto an Oliue, blackish without, and as it were withered; within white and solide. It groweth in great quantitie on the hils in Sauoy. and about Geneua, also about Salmes in high Burgundy, and on the hils of Switserland. The latter Greeke wri∣ters call it Zadura, Zaduaria, Zedura, Zu∣dar, Zaduara. Zadur, Zadera, Zaduar, and Zadar: Serapio calleth it Zedoaria, Auicen Zeduar, Gieduar and Napellus Moysi.
The Simplicists name it Anthora, Antitho∣ra, and Anthullia: wherefore whensoeuer you shall find Zurumbet in any composition, then be sure to take Anthora; but if you reade Ze∣doaria, then take Doronicum. Antimony, in Greeke Stibi, Stibium, or Stimmi, of Galen Gynacium, and of Plinie Platiophthal∣mon: it is called at the Apothecaries by the barbarous name Antimonium. Plinie also calleth it Alabastrum, which name is proper onely to Alabaster; it is a minerall like to lead, and knowne of all men. Argentine, Argemone altera, Inguinaria Plinij, Anserina, Argentina, Tenacetum syluestre, A∣grimonia syluestris, Potentilla, and Portentilla. This herb is sufficiently knowne, and much vsed for all paines and gripings in the belly which are without any binding. Aristologie the round, vide Hartwort. Aromaticall wine, is a wine made with spice, and a kind of Hipocras, Aromatites. Hippo∣cras is called in latine Vinum Hippocraticum: the Claret wine Clarea, vinum Claretum, and at the Apothecaries Claretum.

Ars smart, in Gréeke and in Latine Hydropiper, Piper aquaticum, Piper caninum, Herba pauonis, Pauonaria and Persicaria, of Hippocrates, Poly∣craton or Polycriton. It is a wel knowne and contemned herb, but very good for wounds; it is hot and drie. The other kind, which by the vnskilfull without any regard is vsed for the true Ars smart, is somewhat bigger, and hath blewish spots on the leaues, it is also something colder and drier by nature than the former, and it is called Persicaria maior, and Persicaria maculata, and of Plinie Plumbago, and Molybdaena. The first sort is the right Arse smart, which is is not onely vsed in wounds, but also for the Pyles, and the iuice of it for the wormes. Asarabacca, Asarum, Nardus rustica, Vulgago, and as some say Vuluago: the Apothecaries call it Asarum, and some Asara baccara.

BAcon, is called of Plinie in Latine Lardum, and of Plautus Laridum. Badger, Meles, Taxus, Tassus, Taxo, it is a well knowne beast.

The female is the common Bay trée which beareth the berry: the male is altogether like to the former, but that it beareth no berries: the female is called of Plinie Laurus baccalia, and of the Herbarists Laurus foemina, Laurus baccifera, and Laurus foecunda. The male is called Laurus mas, and Laurus sterilis.

Nicolaus Myrepsus calleth it in Gréeke Melissochortum, that is, Herba apum. Our Baulme vndoubtedly is the right Me∣lissophyllum of the auncient Phisitions, al∣though diuers will gainesay it, for both in forme, vertues and operation do they agrée. There be also two kindes of this herbe, the one which is common and dayly vsed, of the which in this place we speake. The other hath long and iagged leaues, and browne flowers, and it beareth the smell of a strong and odoriferous Limon, and it is called Me∣lissa cretica, and Melissa Turcica, to distinguish it from the other: both kinds are in vse. Bearefoot, Acanthus seu Acantha, Herba To∣piaria, Herpacantha, Poederos, or Poederotes, Melamphyllon, of the Simplicists Branca Vr∣sina Italica, to seuer it from our common Bearefoote, which is the right Spondylium of our auncesters. The wild Bearefoote or A∣canthus is very common euery where in Germany, it groweth willingly in low and moyst medowes, and is there called of the
common people Graskol. It is there ordina∣rily vsed in the pot amongst other potherbs. Dioscorides calleth it Acanthus syluestris, the Simplicists call it Carduus pratensis, and Brassica pratensis.

The other sort which is brought vnto vs from forraine countries, is called the red Behen, and but little accounted of with vs. Some do vse the rootes of Tormentill or of Pimpernell for it, and that indéede not amisse, for that the rootes of the red Ben is both without smell and taste, and also vncertaine. Benzoine, Benioninum, Belzoinum, Benzoinum, and Benzuinum, is a swéete smelling iuice, which is called at the Apothecaries Asa dul∣cis, it is very seldome vsed alone, but is al∣wayes vsed in compositions, whether it be be fuming candles or sope balles. Berill, Berillus or Beryllus, it is a precious stone pale gréene coloured. There is ano∣ther kind of it that is somewhat yellowish, and is called Chrysoberillus, that is, a yellow Berill. The Berill is vsed for all infirmi∣ties of the heart, being mixed with other things. Betony, in Gréeke and Latine Cestron, Psycho∣trophon, Betonica, Vetonica, Serratula, and Scri∣bonius doth call it Hierabotane, that is, Sacra herba, otherwise is Verueine called Hiera∣botane.

The third gro∣weth on euery dunghill, it is much lesse, and is called wild Blites. The fourth kind is brought vnto vs from forraine countries, but now it is common in all gardens, and it is called Hungarian or Indian Blites, the Herbarists do call it Blitum Indicum, Bli∣tum Vngaricum, and Blitum Topiarium.

There is another kind of Chry∣socolla, which the Goldsmiths were wont to vse in soddering, this is called of the Greci∣ans Chrysocolla, and in latine Auriglutinum, Gluten auri, and Chrysocolla natiua, but that is not taken inwardly as the common Bor∣ras is. Bran, Furfur, Ca tabrum. Brimstone, in latine Sulfer, Sulphur: there are two kinds of it, the one as it is digged out of the myne, which is called Sulfer vife, in Gréeke Theon Apyron, and in latine Sul∣phurignem non expertum, and Sulphur viuum. The other kind is the common Sulphur or dead Sulphur, in Greeke Theon pepyromenon, in latine Sulphur ignem expertum, Sulphur factitium, and Sulphur mortuum: but when∣soeuer Sulphur or brimstone is found in any composition, then shalt thou vnderstand Sulphur vife.

The other kinde is called the blacke Brionie, but it is not so common with vs as the white: the leaues of this are not much vnlike to the long Hartwort leaues, but they are somewhat longer and tenderer, fashioned like a Hart: it runneth vp into the hedges like ye white. This blacke Brionie is called of Dioscorides Ampelos melaena, Chironios ampelos, Bucranium, and Plinie calleth it Cynacanthe.

It groweth very much about Lauter∣berge in the woods and hedges thereabout. Whensoeuer thou doest find Briony in any cōposition without any addition, then shalt thou vnderstand the white Bryony onely. Broome, is altogether vnknowne to the Gre∣cians, Plinie calleth it Genista, at the Apo∣thecaries Genesta and Genestra. The Sim∣plicists call it Spartium scoparium, and Genesta scoparia, for a difference of the spanish broome which Dioscorides calleth Spartium. Bucke, Hircus, of this beast are many things and parts vsed in phisicke. Buffle, Bubalus. Buglosse, Oxetoong, Land de beuf, in Latine and Gréeke Buglossa, Buglossum, Lingua bouis, Lingua bubula, the Gréekes do also call it Euphrosinon, or Nepenthes: these are the true names of the Buglosse of the auncient Phi∣sitions. The herbes that now a dayes are called Buglosses, are in number 8. whereof thrée are tame or garden Buglosses, and fiue wild. The first kind is called the Spa∣nish Buglosse, which is the true Buglosse of Dioscorides, as euery one doth acknowledge that compareth it with the description, the Simplicists call it Spanish Buglos, Buglos∣sum sempervirens, and Mesues calleth it Bu∣glossa domestica. The second kinde is called Burrage, Borago and Corago, it is both com∣mon and well knowne. Many do take this to be the right Buglosse, but indéede the for∣mer is to be taken for the right. The third is our small Oxetoong, or Lang de beuf, which the Apothecaries do dayly vse, and is called the lesser Buglosse, and of the Her∣bariffs Buglossa minor, Buglossa officinarum. The fourth kind of Buglos, although with vs it be planted in gardens, yet notwith∣standing it is a wild Buglosse, for by Mer∣burge in Lottering, and also in Fraunce it groweth very common in euery field. It is called the greater Buglosse, Italian Bu∣glosse, Buglossum Italicum, Buglossum Galli∣cum, and at the Apothecaries Buglossa maior, Mesues doth call it Buglossa syluestris, and o∣ther will make a kind of Echium of it. The first kinde (and the second among the wilde Buglosses) groweth not aboue one foote in height, it beareth a purple flower admixed with blew, it is commonly found in woods, and in sandy grounds: it is both in smel and taste like the lesser Buglosse, and is called also the lesser wild Buglosse. The Simpli∣cists call this fift kind of Buglosse Buglossa syluatica, lingua Ouina, and Cynoglossa minor. The sixt kind (and the third wild Oxetoong) groweth not aboue a spanne and a halfe in height, it is very sharp & pricking, it beareth a light blew flower, it is found in gardens, and in other well tilled places of it selfe: the Herbarists cal it Buglossum Echiotes, and Bu∣glossū syluestre spinosum. The seuenth buglosse (and the fourth among the wild ones) is also cōmonly so called, it groweth euery where by the high way sides, and drie places, it is well knowne to euery man vnder the name of Buglosse, it is called in Gréeke and latine Echium, Alcibiacum, and of Aegineta Alcibia∣dium and Dorias, of the simplicists Buglossum viperinum, and Buglossum syluestre. The eight kind and fift wild buglosse, is called red Bu∣glosse, because it hath red rootes, it is called in Gréeke and latine Anchusa, but Matthias Syluaticus doth call it Lactuca asinin, the Her∣barists cal it Buglossa rubra, and the Apothe∣caries Alcanna, but Alcanna is other whiles taken for Ligustrum. The first sixe kindes of of tame and wild Buglosses are moyst, and méetly warme, in time of neede they may be vsed one for another. Bull, Taurus. Burre the greater, in Gréeke Prosopis, Prosopi∣um, in Latine Acrium, Personata, Personatia, Bardana, and at the Apothecaries Lappa maior. Butchers Broome, or Knéeholme, in Gréeke Oxymyrsine, Myrsine Agria, Myrtacantha, Myacantha, Schinchus, Scingus, Catangelos, Gyrenia, Ocneron, Cine, and Chamaemyrtus. In Latine Myrtus syluestris, Myrtus Aculeata,
Myrtus acuminata, Myrtus humilis, Myrtus terrestris, Genitura Herculis, Ruscus, and Spina murina, the Herbarists do call it Spina vesper∣tilionis, Palma murina, the Apothecaries Brus∣cus, and Dioscorides Hiera myrtus, that is sacra myrtus. This Butchers broome is only plan∣ted in gardens in Germanie, although his rootes and red berries be dayly vsed of the A∣pothecaries. In France it groweth very common in diuers places, to wit, about Or∣liens and Montargy. C. CAbbage, or Coleworts, a Cabbage is cal∣led in Gréeke Crambe, Cephalote, and Ni∣cander doth call it Gaster: In Latine Caulis imperialis, Brassica capitata, Brassica tritiana, Caulis capitatus, Caulis albus, Brassica alba, and the Apothecaries name it Caputium: this is most common of all other kindes of Cole∣worts, we call it a Cabbage. The other sort of Cabbages is called of Plinie Lacutur∣ris, and of the Simplicists Brassica lacuturria, or Brassica sabaudica, of some Sauoy Cole∣worts. The third kinde is called the red Cabbage, in Greeke Caulodes, in Latine Brassica cumana, Brassica leuis, and Brassica rubra. The fourth sort is named crisped, or crumpled Coleworts, this is much swéeter than any of the rest, and it hath crumpled or wrinkled leaues, like to the headed Lettice, for which cause it is called in Dutch Lat∣toucoole, that is, Lettice Coleworts, and by Plinie Brassica sabellica, and by the Herba∣rists Brassica crispa maior, and Brassica dulcis. The fift sort is the lesser crumpled cabbage, in Greeke Selinoides or Selinusia, and by Athe∣naeus Brassica crispa minor, Brassica Apiana, and Caulis crispus minor. The sixt kind is the common Coleworts, and is also vsed in phi∣sicke, it is called Crambe, Caulis, or Brassica without any addition. The seuenth sort is the caulyflorie or flowered Cabbage, Plinie calleth it Brassica Pompeiana, and the Sim∣plicists Brassica cypriana, and Florecaulis. The eight kind is called Rapecole, or Rapocaulis, but this sort was altogether vnknowne to our predecessors. Calamine is the oare of brasse, Cadmia, Cadmia fossilis, Cadmia natiua, for a difference of Cad∣mia factitia, or Tuttie, Plinie nameth it Lapi∣dem aerosum, the Apothecaries barberously call it Climiam, Cathimiam, and Lapidem Ca∣laminarem, and those that worke in mines name it Cobaltum. This minerall stone is much vsed amongst Chirurgians, and is the very best of all the sorts of Cadmia, as Galen witnesseth. Calcedonie, Calcedonius is a precious stone, and a kind of Onyx. Calmus was by the auncient Phisitions called Acorus: some do take the great Galingal for it, and although the same be not the right Acorus, yet is their error more tollerable than of those that vse the Ireas roote in stead of Calmus. Calmus Aromaticus, is the right Calmus of the auncient Phisitions, and it is called Acorus and Piperatum: but the right Calamus Aro∣maticus is a swéete smelling réede, which is neuer brought vnto vs, and therfore we do vse Acorus, that is Calmus, which doth now supply the place both of Calmus and of Cal∣mus Aromaticus. Camelina is called of Dioscorides Myagrum, of Theophrastus Erysimum, of Herbarists Came∣lina, of the Apothecaries Sesamum. And al∣though it be not the right Sesamum of the auncient Phisitions, yet doubtlesse it may safely be vsed in stead thereof, because as yet the right Sesamum is not knowne. It hath power to warme reasonably, and to ease all manner of paine: wherefore it is much better to vse a thing in place of the true Sesamum which is well knowne, than a thing altogether vnknowne and vncertain. Camell, Camelus. Cammomils, in Gréeke and Latine Chamea∣melum, Anthemis, Leucanthemis, and Leucan∣themum, the Apothecaries do call it Chame∣milla and Camomilla. Chamemils are hote and drie in the first degree. Campher, Caphora, Camphora, in Latine and in Gréeke Caphura: it is a strong smelling iuice or sap of a trée in Indie: it is colde and drie in the third degrée, and it is much vsed in phisicke. There is yet another kind of Cam∣pher, which is a kind of minerall or of Am∣ber, called Campher of the mine, that is hot and drie by nature. This kind of Campher is altogether vnknowne to the Phisitions, for which cause also it is not in vse. Canker, in latine and Gréeke Carcinoma, Car∣cinus & Cancer, a virulent & corroding vlcer. Canterbury bels, in latine Smilax leuis, Volubi∣lis, Campanula, Conuoluulus, Campanella, Sandu∣laca, Coniugulum Catonis, and Funis arborum. This herbe is knowne euery where. Capers, in Gréeke and latine Capparis & Iuturis. Capon, Capus, Capo, and Gallus spado.
Caraway, in Gréeke and latine Carum: Aetius calleth it Careum, Carium: Simeon termeth it Carnabadium: others call it Caroum and Ca∣reosemen: the Apothecaries call it Carui: and Athenaeus Pistinaca maior. Carbuncle, in Gréeke and in Latin Anthracites, and Cabunculus. Carduus benedictus, Atractylis hirsuta, Carduus sanctus, and Carduus Benedictus. Carpe, in Greeke and in Latin Cyprinus, Carpo, and Carpio: Erasmus doth call it Carpa. Carot, Carota, Pastinaca Rubra. Cassie canes or pipes, in Latine and in Gréeke Cassia, Casia, Cassia fistularis, Siliqua Aegyptia, and Cassia Carthartica. Cassie wood, looke for Cassialignea, or Xylocassia in the Latine Table. Caterpillers, in Gréeke and in latine Campe, Eruca and Brachus: some men do call them Erucula: they are wormes sufficiently kno∣wen, that eate and spoyle all greene herbes, as Cabbages, leaues of hedges and trées. They that liue on the Pine trées and Firre trees are called in latine Erucae Pinorum, and Erucae Picearum, in Gréeke Pityocampe. Cats Mints, field Mints, wilde Penniroyall, Calamintha agrestis, or Aruensis, and Pulegium agreste. Of Mesua, Calamintha domestica, Cala∣mintha felina, and Cattaria. Celendine, in Gréeke and latine Chelidonium mius, Cratea, Philomedium, Othonium, Radix Pandioi tubium, Fabium, and of the Alchi∣mists Celidonium, of Serapio Cauroch, Curcu∣ma, and of the Apothecaries Celidonia. It is an herbe common and well knowne: the Simplicists do call it Herba hirundinaria ma∣ior. The second kinde is called the lesser Ce∣lendine, Pilewort, or Figwort: in Greeke and in Latine Chelidonium minus, and Triti∣cum syluestre, of the Herbarists Herba hirun∣dinaria minor, Testiculus Sacerdotis, Scrophula∣ria, or Scrofularia, and at the Apothecaries Celidonia minor. The former kind is alwaies vnderstood if it be without any addition. Centorie, in Gréeke and latine Centaurium mi∣nus, Lymnesium, Lymnaeum, Libadium, febrifuga, and Felerrae. Ceruse, in Gréeke and latine Psymmithium, Ce∣russa. Ceterach both great and small. The lesser Ce∣terach is called in Gréeke and in latin Scolo∣pendrion, Hemionion, Asplenium, of Scribonius Largus, Calcifraga, of the Herbarists Scolo∣pendria vera, and Scolopendria minor, Splenium, Asplenium and Ceterachum. The Apotheca∣ries do call it Ceterach as the Arabians do: it is the true Scolopendrium of the auncients: Theodorus Gaza calleth it Mula, or Herba Mula. Our vnskilfull Phisitions and Apo∣thecaries do vse the Harts toong Phyllitis, for the true Scolopendrium without any re∣gard or care. If Rosemary were not so com∣mon, they would take the Iuniper trée for it, and Nettles for Marierom: wherefore it is a great grace that old women do so wel know the herbes, otherwise they would of∣ten be deceiued, séeing their whole trust and credite relieth on the Herbe wiues. The o∣ther kinde of Ceterach is also called Harts toong, of Dioscorides Lonchitis altera, of the Simplicists Scolopendrium maius, Scolopen∣dria maior, Asplenium, Asplenium maius, Spican∣tum, Scolopendrium, or Asplenium syluestre, be∣cause it groweth in darke and moist places. Both these herbes do take their names of the worme Scolopendra, which is called an Earwig, or woorme with many legges, be∣cause the leaues seeme to be noted with it. Both these herbes haue the same operation, for they are both hot in the first, and drie in the second degree: they are the best spleneti∣call herbes that are to be found, for they are good for all maladies of the spleene. Chaste trée is called in Gréeke and in latine Amictomiaenum, Agnos, Lygus, Agonus, Trida∣ctylum, Lecristicum, Vitex, and Salix Armerina: of the Herbarists Piper Agrestis, Piper Mona∣chorum, Arbor casta, and of the Apothecaries Agnus castus. There are two kindes of it, to wit, the greater and the lesser Chast trée. The great groweth in height like the Wil∣low trée, and hath also leaues most like it, it smelleth very pleasantly, the flowers are white and purple coloured. The other kind hath altogether purple floures, it is fuller of branches, hath whiter leaues, and is much lesse than the former. Charuill, Caerephyllon and Cherefolium, and of the common Phisitions and Apothecaries Cerefolium. Chestnut tree, Castanea, Glans Sardiana, Iouis glans: the fruite is called Nux Castanea: there are diuers kinds of them that are not néed∣full to be rehearsed at this present. Cherries, Cerasa, there are two kinds of them, sweete and sower, and each of them may be subdeuided into moe kindes. The hard, sweete, and great Cherries are in some pla∣ces called Spanish Cherries, and in latine Cerasa duracina, or Pliniana, they haue a very
swéete and pleasant taste: amongst these are the white Cherries also comprehended. The common red Cherries are called Ce∣rasa Mellea, for their great and pleasant swéetnesse. The red and sweete Cherries that leaue a bitternesse in the mouth behind haue first bin graffed on a Bay trée, whence they as yet do kéepe their bitternes, and are called Cerasa Amarella, and Laurea. The blacke tame Cherries are called Cerasa actia, Actiana, Caeciliana, and Cessiana. The little wild and blacke Cherries are comprehen∣ded vnder the Actiana: and in like sort al∣so the little wilde and red, vnder the great red and domesticall or tame Cherries. Of the sower Cherries there be two sorts, to wit, white and red; the red are called Apro∣niana cerasa: others call them Iuliana, and Aquea. The blacke are named Cerasa Ama∣rina, and Amarena: but amongst all kindes of Cherries, are the wild blacke, the red, and the domesticall blacke Cherries vsed most in Phisicke, and aboue all other those blacke ones that are called Amarena. Wherefore if one finde the name of Cherries in any re∣ceit without any addition, then are the black Cherries or Amarena to be vnderstood and taken for it. Chickwéeds, in Gréeke and Latine Alsine, at the Apothecaries Morsus Gallinae, of the Herbarists Pabulum anserinum, and Pauerina. This herbe is cold and moist. Cichelings, in Gréeke and latine Lathyrus, & of Pliny, Cicercula: they are white foure square Peason, sufficiently knowne of euery man.

Of the other kinde of Intybus looke in E. for Endiue: Galen calleth all these kinds of Cicories and Endiues Intybolacha∣na, that is, Intybacea olera. Cinnamom, in Gréeke and Latin Cinamomum, Cinnamomum, and Cinnamum: it is a swéete smelling barke, and a well knowne spice: it is also called Canella. It is hot and drie in the third degrée.

Citrull, Citrullus. Clarie is called of the Herbarists in Latine Oruala, Orualla, Sclarea, Scarlea, Matrisaluia, Galli crista, Totabona, and Herba sancti Iohan∣nis, at the Apothecaries Gallitricum, and Centrum Galli: it is a kinde of Orminum or Horminum, although it be neither of them that Dioscorides doth write of, yet may it by reason of his similitude, properties and ver∣tues be vsed either with or for Horminum. The other kind of Clary is the wild Clary, that groweth euery where in the fields, it hath déep iagged leaues with a blew purple flower, and is called Scarlea syluestris, or Scla∣rea syluestris, and Gallitricum syluestre. But whensoeuer Clary is prescribed, then ought the garden Clary to be vsed. Clauers, looke in T. for Thrée leafed grasse. Clay, Argilla: M. Cicero calleth it Terra sigilla∣ria, Columella, Terra figularis. This Clay is vsed in this booke for the bléeding at the nose. Cloues, in Gréeke Caryophyllum, at the Apothe∣caries Cariofilus or Gariofilus. Cocke, Gallus Gallinaceus. Cockle, vide Cornerose. Codwort, in Gréeke and Latine Bubonium, Asterium, Aster Atticus, Asteriscus, Hy∣ophthalmus, Herba inguinalis, and Inguinaria, of the Herbarists Stella Attica, Oculus suis, and Alibium. There be foure kinds of it, to wit, the first with the blew flower, which is commonly knowne by the name of Cod∣wort. Some Simplicists do call it for a dif∣ference Bubonium caeruleum. The second is almost like the former, but that the leaues and the flowers be somewhat bigger, and the flowers yellow, and starwise like the blew: this groweth by the riuer of Rhene. The Herbarists terme it Bubonium luteum, and Inguinaria lutea. The third kind grow∣eth on dry hils, whereof the leaues are lesse, double, wrinkled, and bended almost like a
halfe moone, the flowers are very yellow, and lesse than the aforesaid: the Simplicists call it Bubonium lunatum. The fourth kind hath long and picked leaues, with thrée or foure sinewes, like to the lesser Plantaine, & hath a faire starlike flower, yellow euery where, & euery flower hath sixe small leaues vnder it, placed also like a star. This kind did we first get from Marselles, for which cause it is now called Bubonium Massilioticum, and Stella Massiliotica: but when and wheresoe∣uer Codwort is named with any addition, there is alwayes the cōmon Codwort with the blew flower to be vnderstood. This may also be called Ramicaria, or Rupture wéede, because it is especiall good for the Rupture. Coloquint, in Gréeke and latine Colocynthis, Sicyona, Cucurbita syluestris, Cucurbita syluatica, and Cucurbitula. Conie, in Gréeke Dasipus, of Polybius and Galen Cunilus, in latine Cuniculus: it is a well kno∣wen beast in all countries. Copper is called in gréeke Chalcos, in latin Aes, Aes Cyprium, Cuprum.

Cornerose or Cockle, in Gréeke Lychnis agria, in latine Lychnis syluestris, of the Simplicists Caryophyllus aruensis, Pseudomelanthium, Gi∣thago and Nigestrum: Dioscorides calleth it A∣tocium, Hieracopodium, Tragonatum, Lampada, and Semura: some vnskilfull Phisitions and Apothecaries haue vsed this herbe for the Melanthium or Nigella of the auncients, the which error diuers Apothecaries and fond fellowes haue so imbibed, that they will ra∣ther follow their owne foolish opinions, than be better instructed of others. Corall, in gréeke and latin Coralium, Corallium, Gorgonia, Lithodendron, Dentrites & Eurallium. Costus roots, Costum & Costus: of this roote there be two kinds, to wit, the bitter & the swéete Costus rootes. The bitter roote is alwayes vsed for the Costus without any addition. Coutsenille, in gréeke & in latine Coccos baphica, of Pausanias, Hysge, Coccum infectorium, Coc∣cum tinctorium, Granum infectorium: in the Arabian toong Kermes and Chermes. The Silke diers for a difference of the crimson colour, haue named it Kermesinum granum, for the crimson colour and Kermes of the A∣rabians is not one and the selfesame. The Coutsenille is called Kermesinum, by reason of her braue colour, which is somewhat like vnto scarlet. Also the crimson colour called Kermesinum, is taken from the rootes of cer∣taine herbs, and it is an external thing from the rootes, although it grow with them, for it is found to grow on the barks of certaine trées, and hath no vertue or vse in phisick at al, as the Coutsenille doth, which is the na∣turall fruite of a little trée, not vnlike to our Butchers broome, but that it is somewhat lesse, with fewer leaues & fruits: wherefore they do erre greatly that take the crimson colour Kermesinum for the Coutsenille, and vse it for the same in their compositions and medicaments. But the Apothecaries do erre more grosly that do vse the Gooseberries in stead of the Coutsenille, and (that which is worse) the vnskilfull Phisitions do beare with it, & let it passe for good, so that it may wel be said of them, that one blind man lea∣deth another: but woe be to the patient, for he ought not to be iested withall, séeing the Coutsenille is not vsed but in extreme debi∣litie of the heart, for which neither the crim∣son colour, nor the Gooseberry hath any ver∣tue at all. The Coutsenille is also vsed of women with child for to comfort & streng∣then the child in their bodies, and to preuent all mischances, for the which it is very méet and requisite. The Gooseberry is of a quite contrary nature. Cowslips, Cowslops, of some Ladykeyes, or Primroses, in Gréeke Phlomis, Arthritica, in latine Verbasculum, the Herbarists do call it Herba paralysis, Primula veriflora, Primula veris, Bracha cuculi, and Herba primi floris; and at the Apothecaries Athretica, and Betonica alba, the which is indéed the right white Be∣tony. There are thrée kinds of them: the first kinde are the common Cowslops with the yellow flowers, that grow euery where in drie meadowes, and on grassie hilles: these are called of the Herbarists Ʋerbasculum o∣doratum, by reason of their pleasant smell. The second kinde groweth in the wooddes, and is much bigger than the common Cow∣slops, it hath a pale yellow colour, but without any smell at all, and it is called Verbasculum syluestre, and Verbasculum al∣bum; and when this kinde is set in gar∣dens, it groweth as bigge againe as before. The third kinde are the double Cowslops,
that are set in gardens, and they are much fairer, greater, and more pleasant than the common, & are called Verbasculum multiplex. Creuets, in Gréeke and in Latine Astacus flu∣uiatilis, Cammarus, Gammarus: it is a kinde of shell fish very common and wel knowne. This fish is now a dayes of diuers learned men called Cancer vniustly, for that there be no Cancri in Germanie; for the true Cancri haue no taile as our Creuets haue, which are in all points like to the Lobsters, but that they are much lesse. Crabs or wild Apples, Malum syluestre, or Po∣mum syluestre: they and their leaues are vsed for the laske. Cresses, in Greeke and Latine Cardamum, Na∣sturtium hortense, and of the common Herba∣rists Cressio. Cricket, Grillus, a little worme very common in all brew houses.

Pli∣nie calleth the double Crowfoote Polyanthe∣mum, it is called here Batchelers buttons, and of the Simplicists Ranunculus multiplex. There are diuers kindes of it, but because they are not al of them vsed in Phisicke, we will onely speake of the lesser sort, which by reason of the round roote that it hath it is called Ranunculus rotundus, and at the Apo∣thecaries Flammula, and of some (for to di∣stinguish it from the other sorts) Flammula minor, and Flammula rotunda: and this kinde of Crowfoote is only to be vsed in Phisicke. Cuckoe, in Gréeke Coccyx, in Latine Cuculus, a bird too common and well knowne.

There is yet a third kind called Symphytum petraeum, of Apuleius Xylophyton and Anachylis, of the Herbarists Consolida petraea: this groweth on hils and stonie places. Cumin, in Greeke and Latine Cuminum, Cymi∣num, Cuminum satiuum, Cuminum hortulanum, and Cuminum Romanum. D. DAffodill, it is called in gréeke and in latine Hemerocallis, Lilium syluestre, Lilium Sara∣cenicum, and at the Apothecaries Affodillus for Asphodelus, but vniustly: and although it be not the true Hemerocallis that Dioscorides describeth, yet it is a kind of it, and very like it in vertues and operation. The right Daf∣fodill is called in Gréeke and Latine Aspho∣delus, Hastula regia, Albucum, the flowers with the stalke Anthericos. It is now by the diligent and expert Phisitions brought in∣to vse againe. Damaske prunes, Pruna Damascena. Dandelion, Priests crowne, wilde or yellow Cichorie, in Gréeke Hedypnois, of Theophra∣stus Aphaca, and of the Herbarists Seris vri∣naria, Herba vrinaria, Seris somnifera, Caput Monachi, and dens Leonis. The Apothecaries and vnskilfull Phisitions do call it Taraxa∣con, and Altaraxacon, which names are due to Plantaine, as may be séene by Serapius and the Arabians. For that which Dioscori∣des calleth Intybus Syluestris, that do they call Taraxacon or Altaraxcon. This herbe is cold by nature, it prouoketh sleepe, it openeth all inward obstructions, it moueth vrine abun∣dantly. Danewéede, in Gréeke and Latine Chamaeacte, Ebulus, Sambucus pumila, Sambucus humilis, Sambucus aruensis.

The other kind is called Bellis maior, Bellium maius, and of the Herbarists Chenanthemum, Consolida media vulnerariorum.
Diamond, Adamas, a well knowne gemme or precious stone. Dill, Anethum, it is hot in the third, and drie in the second degree. Diptamer, Diptamus, in Gréeke and latin Pole∣monia or Polemonium, Phyletaeria, Chiliodyna∣mis, Fraxinus pumila, Fraxinula, Frassinula, Fraxinella, Frassinella, and Dictamus albus. The Apothecaries call it Diptamus, and Di∣ctamus albus. This plant hath bene taken a great while for Paeonia mascula, but it is the true Polemonium of the auncients. Dishwasher, a little bird called Motacilla, Cau∣da Tremula, and of Hesichius, Cyrillus, it is a common and well knowne bird. Diuels bit, Morsus Diaboli, Succissa, Iacea nigra, and Praemorsa. It is a kind of Scabious, and is not vnlike the same, only that the leaues of it be not iagged as the Scabious leaues are. Docke, in Gréeke Lapathum, in latine Rumex, and at the Apothecaries Lapatium. There are sixe kinds of Dockes: the first hath long piked leaues like Sorrell, but something sharper, and it is called in Gréeke to distin∣guish it from the rest, Oxylapathum, in latine Lapathum acutum, Lapathum acutifolium, and at the Apothecaries Lapatium acutum. The second kinde hath great broad leaues, not much vnlike the former, but somewhat bigger, the Herbarists do call it Lapathum latifolium, Lapathum platiphyllon, and Lapathū non acuminatum, which is almost altogether in vse vnder the name of Lapathum acutum vniustly; but amongst the vnskilfull Phi∣sitions and Apothecaries a foote or twaine breaks no square: this groweth in medows and other moist places. The third kind hath yet bigger, but softer or gentler leaues: it is sowne in gardens, especially in Fraunce, where they vse it amongst other pot herbes in their porredge, the rootes of it are bigger than the other, somewhat yellow, not much vnlike to Rubarbe: it is called in gréeke La∣pathon Cepaeon, in latine Lapathum domesticum, Rumex satiuus, and by the Herbarists Rha∣barbarum monachorum, and Patientia: some do call it Lapathum latifolium satiuum, to di∣stinguish it from the former. The fourth kind hath very great leaues, and piked be∣fore, it groweth in ponds and other waters, and is called in gréeke Hydrolapathon, and Hippolapathon, in latine Lapathum equinum, Rumex equinus, Lapathum aquaticum, Rumex aquaticus, and palustris; the Grecians do also call it Bulapathon. The fift kind hath leaues like the first and the common Docke, with many red spots and veines, and it is found in gardens, it is called of the Herbarists La∣pathum sanguineum, Rumex sanguineus, and Sanguis Draconis. The sixth kind is Sorrell, whereof shall be spoken elsewhere. Doronicum, the Arabians do call it Doronigi: it is mingled with other things that serue for comforting of the heart. Some will affirme that it is venemous, because the second kind of it is such, that it killeth both man & beast: Wherefore if our Doronicum be poison, then must of necessitie follow that the herbe An∣tora or Antitora be also venemous, because the one is as like the other in leafe, flower, and root, that the one can hardly be knowne from the other. But that our Doronicum is no poison, hath experience taught vs many yeares ago. Dragons, in gréek Dracontium, Dracontea, Dra∣contia, Isarum, Biarū, Iarum, Harmiagrion, and Sigiginalium. Apuleius calleth them Pythoniū, Anchomanos, Sauchromaton, Typhonium, Croco∣dilium, Therium, and Theriophonum; in latine Serpentaria, Columbina, Colubrina, Mauriaria, Dracontea, and Collum Draconis: of the Ara∣bian Phisitions Luf, Luph, or Alluff: the Simplicists do call it Dracunculum. There are thrée kinds of Dragons, to wit, the first, which we doe call the greater Dragons, Dracontium maius, Dracunculus maior, & Co∣lubrina magna, thereby to know it from the other two sorts. The second kinde is some∣what lesse, and like to the Cuckopit, it is called Dracontium minus, Dracunculus minor, or Colubrina minor, and of Athenaeius, Aronia: Cordus doth call it Dracunculum, Henicophyl∣lon, and Luph planum: the greater they call Luph Crispum. Others doe call it the lesser Dragons, that is, Serpentaria minor. The third kind groweth neare the water, vpon a stubbed roote, with many stalkes vnto it, and on euery stalke one onely leafe, much like to Iuie, and euery stalke bringeth a bunch of berries like Cukopit: it is called Dracunculus palustris, Dracunculus aquatilis, Colubrina palustris, and Arum palustre. We call them water Dragons. Some simple Phisitions and silly Apothecaries do vse the Bistorta rootes for the rootes of Dragons: but what great distance is betwéene them, what difference in their vertues and operations, is sufficiently knowne to the learned. Dragonblood, Cinnabaris Indica, Sanguis Draco∣nis,
and Lacryma Draconis, it is the sap of a tree in the Indies called Draco. Ducke, he or she, Anas. E. EArth sealed, in gréeke Sphragis, in latine Terra lemnia, Sigillum lemnium, Lutum lem∣nium, Rubrica lemnia, Minium lemnium, Lu∣tum sigillatum, and at the Apothecaries Ter∣ra sigillata: This earth is maruellously fal∣sified and counterfeited, wherefore great heed must be had in the vse of it. Our hedge Phisitions will rather vse clay, than want earth in their receipts. Earthwormes, Lumbrici, Vermes terreni, Inte∣stina terrae. Eele, Anguilla, the well knowen fish, that will not be held by the taile. Elecampane, in latine Helenium, Enula, Enula campana, and Terminalium. Elderne, in greeke Acte, & in latine Sambucus. Elme, in greeke Ptelea, in latin Vlmus: there are 2. kinds of it, the cōmon is called Vlmus cam∣pestris. The other kind groweth on hils, & is called in gréeke Oriptelea, in latine of Ga∣za, Montiulmus, & of others Vlmus Montana. Endiue, in greeke & in latine Intybus, Intybum, Intybus satiuus, & Seris, at the Apothecaries Endiuia: it is a kind of tame Succory, and is knowen at this present in euery place. Endiue the white, or ye lesser Endiue, in gréeke and latine Intybum satiuum angustifolium, Se∣ris satiua angustifolia, Seris satiua minor, and Seriola: the Apothecaries do call it with a barbarous name Scariolam. Eryngus in gréeke & latin Eryngium, of the Her∣barists Herba pleuritica, Acus veneris, Capi∣tulum martis, Centumcapita, and at the Apo∣thecaries Iringus. There are two kindes of it, the one, which is common with vs, and by the name of Eryngus sufficiētly knowen. The other kind hath broade leaues, and is not so pricking as the former, it hath also a faire and bigger top, and a faire skie colou∣red flower, it is planted in gardēs, it grow∣eth otherwise at the sea side: the Simpli∣cists call it Eryngium marinum. Some vnex∣pert Phisitions and Apothecaries doe vse the star Thistle for Eryngus, but erroniously, for it is a little Thistle, much lesse than the Eryngus, it hath many little heads, with purple flowers, and prickles about them standing out like a starre, it hath a small roote, that perisheth in winter, it groweth euery where in dry places. The Herba∣rists doe call it Carduus Stellatus, Carduus Calcifragus, Tribulus stellatus, Acanthasteri∣on, Spinastella, Calcitrapa, and Calcitripola: Valerius Cordus doth call it Polyacantha, but it is not the Polyacantha of Theophrastus. Others doe call it Eryngium minus, that is, the lesser Eryngus. And although this Thistle do also moue vrine, or prouoke the termes in women as Eryngus doth, yet neuerthe∣lesse it is not the same, but it is much stron∣ger than the Eryngus; for if one vse too much of it, then doth it expell blood with the vrin: wherefore the same is dulie to bée vsed, and in steede of Eryngus vse the common Thistle, or Squilles for it: Rondoletius doth call Eryngus by the name of Corono∣pus. Escharbot, in gréeke Cantharus, in latine Can∣therius, Scarabaeus, and Pilularius. F. FEarne, in gréeke and latine Pteris, Ble∣chron, Dasyclonon, and Filix, a well knowen hearbe, and common in all woods and Heathes: it is called of Nicander, Betrus. Fenegréeke, in gréeke Telis, Aegoceros, Cerai∣tis, of Pliny, Carphos, of Theophrastus, Buce∣ras, of Hippocrates, Epiceras; in latine Foe∣numgraecum, of Pliny, Silia, of Varro, Silicula, and of the Herbarists Trifolium graecum: it is an herbe, whose séede is onely in vse. Fennel, Foeniculum, Maratrum, it is a common and well knowen herbe. Fesant, Phasianus, Fasianus, and Facidis auis, it is a common bird, which ought to be v∣sed for meate in many diseases, as hath bin shewed in diuers places of our booke. Feuerfew: it is called of the Herbarists Pseu∣doparthenium, Amarella, Solis oculus, Matro∣naria, and Matronella, the practitioners and Apothecaries doe call it Matricaria. This Feuerfew hath vntill this present day béen taken for the true Parthenium of the aunci∣ents, albeit that the most famous & learned Phisitions Antonius Musa Brassauolus, Leonardus Fuchsius, Guilielmus Rondole∣tius, and diuers others haue long since sufficiently shewed, that the bitter and stincking Cammomils (of some called dogs Cammomils) are the true Parthenium, for it is not onely in all poynts correspon∣dent to the description of it, but agrée∣eth also in the virtues and operations with it, and hee that readeth Dioscorides,
is constrayned to affirme the same: where∣fore it is a great wonder, that many men will be so obstinate, that although one do shew them, the truth it selfe, yet will they like swine tumble in their durt, and stick to their vngrounded opinions, whereby they seeme to séeke the ouerthrow of all truths. The true Parthenium are the stinking cam∣momils, which are called of the Herbarists Herba virginea, Cynanthemis, Bufonaria, Ane∣thm caninum, chamaemelum foetidum, and Cotula foetida. Field berries, looke Huckle berries. Field Cypres, in Gréeke and Latine Chamae∣pitys, Abiuga, or Abiga, at the Apothecaries Iua, and Iua arthetica, or Arthetica: of Plinie Thus terrae, of the Herbarists Herba apople∣ctica, cucurbitularis, and Pinus pumila. Fig trée, Ficus. Figs, dryed figs, Ficus, ficus passae, Caricae, there are three kinds of them brought vnto vs, the first are they that come in frayles, and they are the meanest: the second kinde are the leafe Figs, that are brought frō Candy and Cypers, these are fatter and better than the former. They are called leafe figs, because they are packed and made vp with Bay leaues betwéene them. The third kind are lesser and pleasanter than the rest, they are brought from Prouence, they are called figs of Marselles, and these are the best of all for Physick. Figwort, the great Scrofulary, this herb hath been vnknowne to the auncients, and now adayes it is called of our Physitions Scro∣phularia or Scrofularia, and also Millemorbia, or Castrangula. Firre trée, in Gréeke Elate, in Latine Abies, there are two kindes of it, the first is the common firre trée, which of the Simplicists is called the white firre trée, or abies candida, the second kinde of Firre trée is called in Gréeke Peuce, in Latine Picea, and of the Herbarists Abies nigra, which is the red firre trée. But where thou findest Firre trée in any receipt without addition, there is the common Firre tree meant. Fitches, in Gréeke Bicion, or Aracus, in Latine Vicia, there are two kinds of them, the first is that which is knowne to all men by the name of Fitches, the other kinde groweth of it selfe heere and there, they are called wild fitches, Dioscorides doth call them A∣phace, in Latine Vicia syluestris. But if the name of Fitches be found without additiō, then shalt thou vnderstand the first kind of them. Our vnskilfull southsayers and Apo∣thecaries do take the fitches for the true Eruum of the auncient writers, but it is an opē deceipt, which ought to be punished by the Magistrates, & to call such careles fel∣lows in question for their false quid pro quo. Flax, in Greeke and Latine Linum, Plinie cal∣leth all that Linum that may be spun. Fleawort, in Greeke and Latine Psyllium, herba pulicaris, pulicaria, of Plinie Cynoides, and Cynocephalon. The seed only of this herb is vsed in physick, it is cold in the second, and dry in the first degree. Flint or pible stone, in Greeke Chalix, in La∣tine Silex. Floure deluce, Lilium caeleste, and Iris Germani∣ca. Although this our Flour deluce do not agree in euery respect with the Ireas of Italy, yet it is a kinde of it, and much stronger in purging, for which cause it is aboue all o∣ther kinds vsed in the Dropsie. Folefoote, in Gréeke Bechium, and Chameleuce, in Latine Populago, Tussilago, of the Herba∣rists Vngula caballina, & herba Diui Quirini, at ye Apothecaries Farfara, of Theophrastus Aphyllātes, because that it bloweth without any leaus, wherfore it is also called of some filius ante patrem, others do likewise terme it populus humilis, or pumila, farfarella, farfarago. Framboys, in Gréeke and Latine Batus Idaeus, Rubus Idaeus, Rubus Ceruinus, Ceruirubus, the whole shrub is called the Framb hedge, the fruite Framboys, mora rubi Idaei. Frankinsence, in Gréeke and Latine Libanus, or Libanum, Libanotis, Thus, Tus, Opolibanum, Incensum, and at the Apothecaries Olibanū. There are foure kinds of it, the first is very white, round, and little cornes or graines, it is called in Greeke Stragonias, of Plinie Thus masculum, of the Simplicists Thus te∣sticulatum, at the Apothecaries Olibanum te∣sticulatum, in english white Frankinsence, and this is the best of all the kinds. The se∣cond kinde is gray, yellowish, and is that which is left after the former is picked out, & it is only called Frankinsence. The third is also vsed, and it is full of barks, to which the Frankinsence sticketh, and it is taken from the trée: and although it be thought vncleane, yet hath it his place in Physick as well as the best. This is called Thuris cortex, Thus corticosum, & at the Apothecaries Olibanum corticosum, in english rindes or barks of Frankinsence. The fourth kinde
are the reliques that are left after the for∣mer three kindes are taken out, all these kinds do come of one and the same tree: but there is yet another contemned kinde of Frankinsence at the Apothecaries, and also at the Druggists, that is not worthie to be numbred amongst the former kindes, be∣cause it is only a deceipt and knauery vsed in stead of good ware, wherefore it ought by good right to be throwne out of dores. This is made of the gum of ye Pine trée, & so pre∣pared deceitfully, it is called Thus Adulte∣rinum, in English counterfeited Frankin∣sence. Frankincense the black, Timiama, in Gréeke Nascaphthum Narcaphthum, of others Thy∣miama & at the Apothecaries Thymiana. It is a sweete smelling barke which is vsed in swéete vnguents, or fuming candles: some do call it Incensum nigrum. French Beanes, Phaseolus, Phasiolus, Dolicus, Phaselus. Frogge, Rana. Fumitory, in Gréeke and Latine Capnos fuma∣ria, and Fumus terrae, the Herbarists call it Cerifolium felinum, and Columbinum. It is a well knowne herbe, and is hot and dry in the third degree. G. GAdrise trée, a trée called in Gréeke and Latine Crania, Cornus. Galingall, Cyprus Babylonius, and Galanga, a well knowne spice, whereof there be two kinds, to wit, the great & the lesser, but the lesser is the true Galingall, and is to be v∣sed in stead thereof, but the great is called Galanga maior. This is vsed of some for the true Acorus, that is Calmus: but they erre greatly, for Acorus is our common Calmus, as hath been shewed elsewhere. Galles, Galla, they that growe on our Oakes are altogether vnméete for Physick, they are called of Galen Onicicidae, that is, asininae gallae. Garlick, in Greeke Scorodon, and in Latine Allium. Gillowfloures, are called of the Herbarists Cariophyllus flos, Cariophyllus hortulanus, Ca∣riophyllus domesticus, Betonica altilis, & of Plinie Cantabrica, the Apothecaries call it flos cha∣riophyllorū, but there are diuers other herbs that are called Herbae tunicae, but some sup∣pose Carduus Benedictus to be the right herba tunica, where they should reade herba turca or turcha and not tunica. Gordonius doth call our Ocymastrum that is Behen, herbam tuni∣cam, so that almost each author hath his owne herbam tunicam. Some do call our Gillowfloures flos tunicus, to distinguish it from herba tunica, which is Behen, and they do very well, for a thing well distin∣guished preuenteth many errours. Gentian, in Greeke and Latine Narce, Aloë Gallica, and Gentiana. Gentian the lesser, in Gréeke Phyteuma, in La∣tine Cruciata, Gentiana Cruciata, and at the Apothecaries about the Riuer of Rhene, Herba diui Petri. This herb is vsed euen at this present for thē that haue taken some∣what to fall in loue with another body, or that are bewitched. It is also a true reme∣die experimented, if it be vsed as it ought. Germander, in greeke and Latine Chamedrys, Chameroys, Lynodris, Trixago, Curcula, & Ser∣ratula. Whensoeuer thou wilt vse German∣der, take that with the browne red floures, which is a kind of Teucrium, for that is the true Germander, and is called of some Ca∣lamandrina, and Morsus mulierum. Ginger, Zingiber, a well knowne spice, called also Gingiber, & at the Apothecar. Zinziber. Gips, in greeke and latine Gipsus, or Gipsum: there are diuers kinds of it, but the best is that which is most like to chalke. Gitte, in latine and gréeke Melanthium, Gith, and at the Apothecaries Nigella Romana. There is yet another kinde of it, whereof the plant is bigger, & more pleasant to be∣hold, but the séede is not so strong in smell, and is called Damaske Nardus, of the Her∣barists Nigella Damascena: but the first kind is only vsed in Phisick. They are both of them hot and dry in the third degrée. Glew, in gréeke Colla, and Xylocolla, in latine of Virgil, Gluten, of Varro and Salustius Glu∣tinum, otherwise also Glutinum taurinum, and at the Apothecaries Gluten ligni. It is vsed in plaisters for the rupture. Gnat, in gréeke Conops, and of Hesichius No∣pis, in latine Culex. Goat, Capra. Goldfinch is called in gréeke Acanthis, in la∣tine Carduelis, and is good in meates for them that haue a cold stomack. Goose, Anser. Goosegras, in gréeke Aparine, Omphalocarpos, Philanthropos, in latine Aspergula, Asperula, and Speronella, it is a well knowne weede, hot and dry by nature.
Gourdes, Cucurbita esculenta, Cucurbita ventri∣cosa, Cucurbita cameraria, Cucurbita perticalis, and at the Apothecaries Cucurbita. Graye, looke a Badger, B. Gromell, in Gréeke and Latine Lithospermon, Gorgonium, of Theophrastus Diosporus, and at the Apothecaries Milium solis. Dioscor. cal∣leth it Lithospermum, and Semen Leoninum. There be two kinds of it: the first groweth in the fields and vntilled places: the second is like the former which is vsed at the Apo∣thecaries, but it groweth not aboue a span in height, and the séede is also much lesse, it is called Lithospermon aruense: the other hath small leaues like to Flaxe, and betwéene euery leafe a little seede, not vnlike to the true Gromell: the Herbarists do call it Lin∣gua passerina, Lithospermon syluestre, & Litho∣spermon nigrum: in English black Gromil, to distinguish it from the white which is day∣ly vsed. Some also doe adde to the former kindes Lachrima Iouis, calling it Lithosper∣mon maius, although it haue no communion with them: the first is most vsed. Graines, Cardamomum maius, at the Apothe∣caries Granum Paradisi: it is vsed common∣ly both at the Apothecaries, and in the Kit∣chin. Grasse, in Gréeke and Latin Agrostis, and Gramen. Grashopper, Cicada. Gréenefinch, Acanthus, in Gréek and in Latine Spinus, and of Theodorus Gaza Ligurinus: it is a well knowen bird, and vsed commodi∣ously in meates for all cold rheumes. Gum, in Latine Gummi, at the Apothecaries Gummi Arabicum. H. HAre, Lepus, it is a common and well kno∣wen beast, especially in rich mens hou∣ses. Hares foote, in Gréeke and in Latine Lagopus, Lagopodium, Pes leporinus: the Herbarists do cal it Trifolium Leporinum, Trifolium felinum, and Trifolium Trinitatis. This herb is much vsed for the laske. Harts-ease, in Gréeke and Latine Diosanthos, Phlox, Phlogium, Herba flammea, Herba cla∣uellata, Herba Trinitatis, and at the Apothe∣caries Iacca. Gaza calleth it Flammula: it is otherwise called of the Herbarists Flos Io∣uis. It is an herbe common in all gardens and fields, it is much vsed, and especially the water of it. Harts toong, in Gréeke and Latine Phyllitis, & Lingua Ceruina. It is of diuers vnlearned Phisitions taken and also vsed for the As∣plenium of the auncients, or for the true Sco∣lopendrion; where notwithstanding the true Scolopendrium is common enough. Hartwort or Aristology, Capnos Chelidonia, Capnos phragmites, Pes Gallinaceus: of the Herbarists Pseudoaristolochia, & Radix Con∣caua. The rootes of this herbe haue the vn∣skilfull Phisitions brought in vse for the true Aristology the round, and is vnto this day vsed for the same at many Apotheca∣ries, which neuerthelesse is nothing like it. So befalleth it commonly that we will sée and decerne what is done in the heauens amongst the stars, and do not know those things that are beneath on earth, and be∣longing to our Art. This herbe is a kinde of Fumitorie, which Aetius and Plinie haue so described it as may appeere by their wri∣tings. Here is to be noted that as often as you finde either round Hartwort, or round Aristologie, that the right round Aristology is to be taken for it. The true Aristolochia rotunda is called in Gréeke and Latine A∣ristolochia, and Melocarpon: otherwise it is called for a difference Aristolochia rotunda, and Malum Terrae. Hasell, or Hasell nut, in Gréek Carya, in Latin Corylus, and Nux auellana. There are two kindes of it, the one that groweth euery where in the woods, and the other that is planted in gardens called a Filberd tree. The Nuts are called in Gréeke Leptocary∣on, Nux auellana, Nux pontica, Nux praenesti∣na, Nux Heracleotica, & Auellana. The tame Hasell Nuts are called Filberds, Lombar∣dy Nuts, that is, Nux Longobardica. The wood of the Hasell is cut in chips as the wood of the Ash, and also vsed in the ma∣king of aromaticall wines. Hawthorne, is called of Theophrast. Cynosbatus, of Plinie Cynospaston, and Neurospaston, of Dioscorides Oxyacantha, of Gaza Canirubus, the fruits are called Hawes. Hawke, Accipiter of Virgil Sacerales. Heath, Erica, of Theophrastus Tetralix. Hedghog, Echinus, a well knowen beast, it is full of prickles ouer the whole body, so that his skin will not serue to fur a paire of mit∣tens. Hemlock, is a very venemous herb; it is cal∣led in gréek Conion, Cathechomenion, Abiaton,
Aegynos, Apseudes, Ethusa, Ageomera, Apole∣gusa, Timoron, Dolia, Palyanodinos, Aman osis, Dardanis, Aphros, Creidion, Catapsixis, Coete, in latine Cicuta: it groweth here and there by hedges, in medowes, and in other grassy places, it hath a very stinking and hurtfull sauour. Hempe, in gréeke and latine Schoenostrophon, Asterion, Canabis, or Cannabis: it is but sel∣dome vsed in Phisicke: it is oft called Hal∣terweede. Henbane, in gréeke and latine Hyoscyamus, Dyoscyamus, Emmanes, Duhyrabion, Typhoni∣um, Pythonium, Altercum, Apollinaris, Fabu∣lum, Faba Iouis, Faba suilla, Herba calicularis, Faba Iupina, Mania, and at the Apotheca∣ries Iusquiamus. It is cold in the third de∣grée, especially the white, which only is v∣sed in Phisicke. The gray and black Hen∣bane seeds by reason of their great cold, are taken for poyson, wherefore neither of both ought to be vsed inwardly. Herbe-bennet, looke Auence. A. Herbe two pence, is called of Theophrastus, Erestedanum, in latin Centimorbia, Centimor∣bum, or Centimorbium: at the Apothecaries Numularia, Serpentina minor, and Serpentina∣ria minor. Some do also call it Hirundinaria: it is a common vulnerall herbe. Hermodactyles, in gréeke Colchicon, in latine Ephemerum deliterium, Ephemerum lethale, Bulbus agrestis, of the Herbarists Canineca, Panis Ciconiae, and Bulbus Caninus. Our Phi∣sitions & Apothecaries do call them Hermo∣dactylū. But because ye diuers other plants are called Hermodactiles, it is néedefull to distinguish them here, that no man put ei∣ther himself or any body else in danger: for our common Hermodactylus, is the Hermo∣dactyle roote, and the true Colchicum, which Galen calleth Ephemerū deleterium: Auicen∣na, Serapio, and other Arabian Phisitions do affirme the same: and it auayleth nought, that some will distinguish the Colchicum of the Grecians, from the Hermodactylus of the Arabians: their false and erronious o∣pinions are easily withstoode, for you neede but only compare the chapter of Hermoda∣ctyles of Serapio, with the chapter of Colchi∣cum of Dioscorides, then shall you euidently perceiue that it is one and the same roote: For Serapio being a diligēt follower of Di∣oscorides, hath taken his chapt. de Hermoda∣ctylo out of the chapt. de Colchico Dioscoridis verbatim, word for word; as he hath also done in all other plants that are described of Dioscorides, as all they may perceiue that haue cōferred both these authors togither. Wherefore it is most sure yt the Colchicum of the Grecians, and the Hermodactylus of the Arabians, which now also are vsed for Hermodactyles, are one and the same. But Dioscorides and Serapio affirme their Col∣chicum and Hermodactylus to bée a poyson as well as the venemous Toade-stooles, wherefore also they commaund, that they be in no wise vsed or eaten: And although Serapio doe saie that the Hermodactyles be good for the Goute, and other ioint diseases, yet he addeth, that if one vse too much of them, that thereby the muscles and the sto∣macke are marueliously weakened: but then he speaketh of the roote of the white Hermodactyles, and supposeth that they that are red and blacke should altogither kill one. Seeing then they are so dange∣rous these rootes ought not to be tolerated at the Apothecaries, and much lesse to bée vsed inwardly. Whereas then we know sufficiently that our Colchicum, or Hermo∣dactylus is so venemous, therefore must they needes lie extreamely, that bragge that they can cure all ioynt-diseases with it. For it is most true, that they that vse these Hermodactyles for the Gowte, whether it be in Pilles, Potions, or any other way, doe waxe woorse and woorse euery day, and at last are constrained to die an vntimely death, as hath been séene in diuers men, and at diuers times: not∣withstanding that diuers learned men haue warned them that vse such dogged medicines, but no man will be taught of another, which is the onely cause that we will not leaue our owne opinions and errours, which thing doth not onely be∣reaue many a man of this life, but al∣so of the life to come. Wherefore I would admonish and warne euery man to take heede of them, and where he findeth Her∣modactyles in any receipt, that hee omit them. And because that there bee Pilles made with Hermodactyles, which would be verie commodious for the Gout, if they were left out, therefore I would wish the Hermodactyles to be omitted, & to put Tur∣bith, or Agaricke in stéed thereof, or to take Medulla Carthami for it: for they that haue obserued this order, haue found great good by it. But if you take the rootes of the true
Mechoacan for it, that would be much bet∣ter, for I my selfe haue approoued the same: this done, you néed not feare any mishap or daunger, from which I could not omit to warne euery good body. It is very true that diuers Grecian writers, as Actuarius, and Nicolaus Myrepsus, haue left vnto vs certain compositions, wherein are both the white and the red Hermodactyles, as in Aurea Alexandrina Nicolai, and Diamoscu Actuarij, but these authors haue not meant the Her∣modactyles of the Arabians, or the Colchi∣cum Dioscoridis, but they haue meant the Behen album, and rubrum; which very well ought to be noted, that this pretious cōfec∣tion be not defiled with yt Hermodactyles, Turbith, or with Mechoacan. Dioscorides hath also his proper Hermodactyles which he calleth otherwise Pentaphyllum, and it is called in English Cinquefoile, whereof hath béene spoken before. Heron, in Latine Erodius, Rhodius, Auis Diome∣daea, and Ardea: it is a birde euery where well knowen. Hollyhockes, in Gréeke and in Latine Althaea, Aristalthaea, and Dendron Malache, of Aetius and Galen Ebiscus, Ibiscus, Hibiscus, and at the Apothecaries Maluauiscus, and Bismal∣na: the leaues and flowers are hot and dry in the first degree. Hony, Mel. Honysuckle, in Gréeke Periclymenum, Pericly∣menus, Aegine, Carpathon, Splenion, Calycan∣themum, in Latine Volucrum maius, Inuolu∣crum maius, Pileolus Veneris, & of the Herba∣rists Matrisylua, Matersylua, or Vinciboscum, of Scribonius Syluae mater: the Apothecaries do call it Caprifolium, or Lilium inter spinas. There are two kinds of it, first the common sort which is knowen euery where by the name of Honysuckle: the other kind is on∣ly set in gardens, and is very like the for∣mer, but that the leaues are somwhat broa∣der, and grow close to the stalks much like the Thorowaxe: the floures are a litle shor∣ter than those of the former, and white of colour intermixed with purple, and smell very pleasantly. In Prouence and Italy is this sort as common as the other is with vs; for it groweth in euery hedge, &c. The Herbarists do call it for a difference from the former, Caprifolium Italicum, Caprifolium perfoliatum, or Periclymenum Italicum, and Periclymenum perfoliatum, both these plants are hot and dry by nature: the leaues and the flowers are vsed for stinking vlcers, fi∣stulaes, canker, and Pockes. Hops, in Greeke Bryon, in Latine Lupulus sa∣lictarius, Lupulus Humulus, and of Mesues Volubilis, or Volubilis magna, Lupus reptitius, Habiola, and Bruscandula. It is hot and dry in the second degrée. Horehound, in Greeke and Latine Linostro∣phon, Phyllopharis, Camelopodium, Prassium, and Marrubium. Horse, Equus. Horse Leache, Hirudo, Sanguisuga: it is a well knowen water worme, it is often vsed to drawe out blood of the body of man. Horse Radish, Sinapi Persicum, at the Apothe∣caries Raphanus maior, of the Herbaristes Raphanus condimentarius, & Raphanus obsonio∣rum. The Arabians do call it Nasturtium al∣bum. This roote is euery where well kno∣wen, and is taken of diuers vnskilfull Phi∣sitions and Apothecaries for Armoracia, and Raphanus minor, or Syluestris, the which are the names of wild Radish. Horsetayle, in Gréek Hippuris, in Latine Equi∣setum, Cauda equina, and Asprella, Dioscori∣des doth also call it Ephedron, and Anabasis. There are two kindes of it the greater and the lesser: the greater is that whereof we haue now spoken: the lesser is called Hip∣puris minor, Equitium. Horsetoong, in Gréeke and Latine Hippoglos∣sum, Hypoglossum, Epiglossum, Epiphyllocarpon, Lingua pagana, Bonifacia, Ʋunlaria, and Bis∣lingua. Hounds toong, Cynoglossum, or Cynoglossa, Lin∣gua Canina: it is cold and dry in the second degrée. Housléeke, in Gréeke Isoon, Hypogressum, Ster∣gethron, Zophthalmon, and Atthales, in la∣tine Sedum semperuiuum, and of Apuleius Vi∣talis, Caulis Iouis, of the Herbarists Herba to∣nitru: the Apothecaries do call it Barba Io∣uis. The second kind is the lesser Housleeke called of the Grecians Trithales, Erisithales, Geostitis, and Petrophyes, in latine Aizoum minus, Sedum minus, Vermicularis, Cauda mu∣ris, of Plinie Digitellus, of the Herbaristes Herba vermiculata, at the Apothecaries Crassula minor: both these herbes haue like operations, for they do dry, coole, and are astringent, but cold in the third degree. Hucckleberries, field Berries, Bilberries, Pseudomyrtus, Vitis Idaea Theophrasti, it is a plant growing on hils and in woods very common. These blacke Berries are falsly
taken for Mirtle seedes of the southsayers and vnlearned crue, as they also do with the leaues in stead of Mirtle leaues, for they could neuer gesse by the signe and course of the Moone, nor by any other stars influence, what the right Myrtus is, for which cause they vse this plant for it; but one must take héede not to vse them for Mirtles, for they neither haue the virtues nor operation of them. Hyssope or Isope, Hyssopus, or Hyssopum. I. IAcinth, in Gréeke and Latine Hyacinthus. It is a pretious stone of a light violet co∣lour. It is called an orientall, or Bohemish Amethist. It is dealt withall of the vn∣skilfull as it is with diuers other simples, for the Chrysolite hath beene vsed many yeeres for the Iacinth, but how erroneously that hath béene done, may appeare by the writings of Plinie, who sayth, that the Ia∣cinth is like the Amethist. Wherefore it is apparāt that the Hyacinthus hath his name of the violet coloured floure Hyacinthus, which is most like to ye naturall Amethist, so that the Chrysolithus hath falsely ben vsed for the Hyacinthus. Also the yellow stone Prasius, or Chrysoprasium hath falsly bin cal∣led Chrysolithus, by which meanes these stones haue bin confused & confusedly vsed the one for the other: wherefore Hyacinthus is the Bohemish or oriental Amethist, & the Chrysolite is a false Iacinth, & Chrysoprasius is the false Chrysolite: this haue I thought good to shew, by reason of the great errors daily committed, to the end ye more warily might be dealt hereafter in the like cases. Iasper stone, it is a pretious stone, whereof there be diuers kindes, to wit, gréene red, light red, darke blew, liuer coloured, and spotted, yellow like Turpentine, and gray with smokie colours: all these kinds are in the fields about Niuernoy, and also héere and there in Fraunce, also in Germany in sundry places, except the gréene and darke greene Iaspers, which only are brought out of In∣dia, these two last kinds are the best. The darke greene Iasper is called Heliotropius: the light gréene like a Smaragde is called Iaspis viridis, this is vsed for the Smaragde but vniustly. The liuercoloured is called at the Apothecaries Lapis Hepaticus. The yellow Iasper is called of Dioscorides The∣rebinthizusa, and the blew Iasper Aerizusa. Iewes lime, in gréeke Asphaltos, in latine Bi∣tumen, and at the Apothecaries Bitumen Iu∣daicum, it hath his name by reason that it was woont to be brought vnto vs from Iu∣daea out of the salt sea, wherein the Iordan doth exonerate it selfe, which also hath bin taken for the very best of Galen, Dioscorides, and of diuers other auncient writers: but that which is now adayes found at the A∣pothecaries is only a deceipt and a coun∣terfeited Iewes lime, to wit, made of Pitch, and Oleum petrae, which is both bought and sould of Iewes, and other co∣uetous Merchants, wherefore it is much better to vse of our Dutch Pitch (which is the right Bitumen) than to take one that is counterfeited. Pitch or Iewes lime is very seldome vsed alone, but it is alwayes mi∣xed with other things. Iewes stone, in Greeke and Latine Tecoli∣thus, Phoenicites, Pyrene, and Eureos. All these names doth Plinie attribute to the Iewes stone, yet he doth also call ye spunge stone Spongites Tecolithus, but this name is only due to the Iewes stone. It is called of Dioscorides, Lapis Iudaicus, by which name it is also knowne at the Apothe∣caries. Incke, Atramentum scriptorium, Atramen∣tum librarium, the Apothecaries do call it Encaustum. Indian nut, in Gréeke Caryon Indicon, in La∣tine Nux Indica, and of Serapio Nergoil. It is a fruit like to the great Pompeons whilst it is gréene, but it is brought vnto vs dried: the shale of it is as hard as a horne, black without, and as big as a common bowle. It is also well knowne in this countrie: within it hath a white pith or kernell, it is vsed at all Apothecaries. The kernell is hot in the second, and moyst in the first degree. Ireas, of Dioscorides, Iris, Ʋrania, Thauma∣stos, Thelpide, or Thalpide, and Cathaeron: of Athenaeus, and Theophrastus, Hieris, in Latine Iris, Opertritus, Radix marica, and Radix consecratrix, of the Herbarists Stra∣pula odorata, Radix violacea, and at the Apothecaryes indeclinabiliter in casu geni∣tiuo, Ireos, or Irios. There are fiue kindes of it, the first is strange, and is only plan∣ted in Gardens, it hath a faire white and odoriferous floure: the roote is also white and sweete smelling: it is called
of the Herbarists Iris alba, Iris domestica alba. The second kind is also planted in gar∣dens, it is very like the former, but the flower is blewe and within of diuers co∣lours, not vnlike to the raynebow: the roote is somewhat grayer than the first, and not so odoriferous: it is called the blew Flower deluce, of the Herbarists Iris caerulea, Iris do∣mestica caerulea, and Lilium caeruleum. The third kinde groweth of it selfe in the woods, it is much like to the last mentioned, but that the flower is bigger and somewhat de∣clining to the Violet or purple colour, with∣in distinguished with many colours like a raynebow. This is called wilde Ireas, of the Herbarists Iris syluestris, Lilium coeleste syluestre. The fourth kind hath small, yet long & narrow leaues, and a faire blew flo∣wer without any smell: the roote is some∣what lesse than of the others, but not odori∣ferous, yea almost without smell, but very sharp and biting in taste. It groweth com∣monly néere the Rhene in marshes: it is called of the Simplicists Iris palustris angu∣stifolia, Lilium caeruleum palustre maius. The fift kind groweth also in moyst places néere the Rhene, it hath broader & shorter leaues than the former with a blewe flower: the roote is very sharpe on the toong but with∣out any sent. It is called of the Herbarists Chamaeiris, Iris pumila, Iris palustris minor, Iris palustris latifolia, Gladiolus palustris latifolius, Gladiolus palustris minor, and Lilium caerule∣um palustre minus. Dioscorides commendeth the Iris Illyrica or Sclauonia aboue all other kindes. This is somewhat lesser than the common kinde of Ireas: it is also some∣what reddish and of a pleasant colour, and swéete in smell. But the Italian Ireas and that which groweth in Apulia, doth not only excéede the former in odoriferousnes, but also in operation; wherefore it is also commended of all learned phisitions aboue that of Illyria. The Herbarists do call it Iris Italica, Iris Florentina, Iris Apula: in English the white Ireas roote. If thou therefore finde Ireas in any composition with any addition, then shalt thou take the Iris Flo∣rentina, which is common at all Apothe∣caries. Isope, looke Hyssop. H. Iuiubes, in Gréek and Latine Sericum, Zyzy∣phum, and at the Apothecaries Iuiuba: it is a kind of Prunes that are well knowen. Iron, Ferrum, it is very much vsed in Phisick: for it is made red hot and extinguished in water, wine, milk, and many other liquors moe. Iuniper trée, in Greeke Arceuthos, in Latine Iuniperus. There are two kindes of it, the great and the lesser Iuniper trée: the lesser is common on euerie hill and knowen to euery man: in Gréeke and of Dioscorides it is called Arceuthis, and Acathalis, of Theo∣phrastus Oxycedrus, in latin Iuniperus minor, Iuniperulus and Iupicellus, in English the Iuniper shrub. The great Iuniper tree hath bigger, stronger, and more pricking leaues, than the lesser, and it is a meetely great trée: the berries & fruits are thrice bigger than those of the former: it groweth on high hils and in woods. It is called in Greeke of Dioscorides Arceuthos, and Acatera, of others Oxyarceuthis, and of Theophrastus Cedria, in Latine Iuniperus maior, Iuniperus acuta, and Cupressus syluestris. They are both of sundry virtues and operations in Phisick, & there∣fore they may be vsed without indifferētly. Iuorie, Ebur, Ebor, Dens Elephantis, but Iuba doth call the Iuorie or Elephants tooth Cerata. Iuie, in Latine and Gréeke Cissus, Hedera, Ede∣ra, and Haedera. K. KIte, Ictinus, in latine Miluus, and Miluius. Knotgras, in Greeke Polygonum, in latine Proserpinaca, Herba sanguinalis, or Sāguinaria. There are thrée kinds of it, to wit, the male, the female, & the lesser knotgras: the male is sufficiētly knowen by the name of Knot∣gras, it groweth euery where on the high waies and vntilled grounds: it is called in gréek Polycarpon, Carcinethron, Teutalis, Myr∣topetalon, Cnopodium, Pedalion, in latine Poly∣gonum mas, Sanguinaria, Herba sanguinalis mas, Seminalis, Vnguis muris, Proserpinaca, of Apuleius Clinopodiontes, Scorpinaca, Statuma∣ria, and Misereuiuium. The Herbarists do call it Polygonum Heracleum, or Herculeum, Corrigiola, Multinodia, Centumnodia, Gramen Porcinum, of Aetius Heliobotane, that is, Her∣ba solis, Dioscor. doth also call it in gréeke Cy∣nochala. The second kind is a kind of Horse∣taile, and is called of the cōmon people the lesser Horsetaile, & of Diosc. to distinguish it from the other Polygonum faemina, or Sangui∣nalis foemina. The third kind and the lesser knotgras groweth willingly in the fields amongst Turneps, and it hath a small star
like leaues, and great store of seed: the Her∣barists do call it Polygonum minus, Centinodia minor, Multinodia minor, Corrigiola minor, Sā∣guinalis minor, Seminalis minor, and Ruella: but whensoeuer any mention is made, then must the first kind be vnderstoode. L. LAdymantle, the greater Sanicle of Valeri∣us Cordus, it is called in gréeke Drosiū, Dro∣sera, and Psiadium: the Herbarists do call it Alchimilla, Stellaria, Sanicula maior, Pes leonis, and Planta leonis: it is a well knowen vul∣nerall herb, yet altogether vnknowen to the auncient Phisitions. It is hot and dry in the second degree, it is vsed in all maner of vulnerall potions, salues, and oiles. Ladythistle, in greeke and latine Sylibū, of the Herbarists Carduus diuae Mariae, Carduus ma∣rianus, at the Apothecaries Chameleonta, as they are taught by the vnskilfull Phisitiōs. Larke, in gréeke Corydes, and Corydalis, of Pliny in latin Galetita, and Alauda. The Larke is much commended for the paine of the belly and many other infirmities. Larks spur, of Dioscor. Cuminū syluestre alterū, of the Herbarists Plectranthemum, Calcaria, Herba diuae Otiliae, Flos regius, Cyminum cornu∣tum, Cyminum siliquosum, Cyminum cornicula∣tum, & Calcatrippa, although the Starthistles in Italy be also called Calcatrippa, at the Apothec. Consolida regia, and Consolida rega∣lis, Ruellius calleth it Cornuta. Lauander, Lauēdula, Lauādula, & Lauendandula. There are 2. kinds of it, sufficiently knowē to euery man, to wit, the great & the lesser, the lesser kind is cōmonly called Lauander, & is euery where knowen by that name: the greater is called Spikenard, & of the Her∣barists Spica hortulana, and Pseudonardus. In old time, as well as in this our age, haue these herbs bin planted néere Bée hiues, be∣cause the Bées do loue both the smell, & the tast of the Lauander flowers. The ancient Phisitions haue called this herbe Casia her∣ba, Casia coronaria, & Cneoron: whereby they haue meant both the Lauāder & the Spike∣nard: for there are 2. kinds of the herbe Ca∣sia. The vse of both these herbs is very com∣mon with vs in Phisicke; not only vsed of it selfe, but mixed also with other things. Laurel, or Lorel, in Gréek Daphnoides, Eupetalō, Pelasgum Plinij, Peploin Dioscoridis, in latine Laureola, and Piper montanum of the Herba∣rists: it is a wel knowē plant, that groweth in the woods, & dangerous to be sed: some vnskilfull Phisitions & Apothecaries do vse it for the true Mezereon of the Arabians. Lead, Plumbum. Leauen, in greeke Zyme, of Theophrastus, Phy∣rama, in latine Fermentum. Lemon, Lemonium malum, Limonium malum, Pomum Lemonium, and Limonium, it is suffi∣ciently knowen euery where. Lentils, in greeke Phacos, in latine Lens, and Lenticula. They are meane betwéen hot and cold, but dry in the third degrée. Lettice, in greeke Thridax, in latine Lactuca, a very common & well knowen herbe. There are many kinds of it: first the common Let∣tice which is called broade Lettice: se∣condly the crumpled Lettice, called Lactu∣ca crispa, and Lactuca cappadox: the third kind is the headed Lettice, Lactuca sessilis; of Pliny, Lactuca Laconica; of Columella, Lactuca Ceciliana, & Lactuca medica; of Athenaeus, Asty∣lis; and of Pithagoras, Eunuchion, because that it hindereth the generation of humane séed: the fourth kind is wild, & is called wild Let∣tice, in greeke Thridax agria, in latin Lactuca syluestris, of the Herbarists Chenoglossum, Lin∣gua anserina, and Carduus Hepaticus. Some blunt Phisitiōs do vse this for Endiue, al∣though ye Endiue be very cōmon & knowen of most men, which is no small error. Licebane, or Stauesacre, in greeke Astaphys agria, Staphys agria, and Phthitioctonum, in la∣tine Vua syluestris, Pedicularia, and Herba pe∣dicularis, of the Herbarists Piper murinum, and at the Apothecaries Staphisagria: of the whole plant is only the séed vsed. Licorice, Glycyrrhiza, Glyceraton, Glycephyton, Adipsos, Sylitra, Lybyestason; and Theophrast. calleth it Eutyglycea, in latine Radix dulcis, Radix Scythica, & at the Apothecaries Liqui∣ritia, & of some barbarous people Regulitia: it is a wel knowen roote, & especially about Bamberge, where it groweth in that a∣bundance, that it doth not only serue Ger∣many but many other countries more. Lighe, Lixiuium, and Lixiuia, of Columell, Spu∣ma caustica, of Martialis, Spuma Bataua. Lignum Aloes, in gréeke Agallochum, of Aetius, Simeon Sethus, Nicolaus, and Actuarius, Xylo∣aloes, in latine of Pliny, Tarum, of the later writers Lignum aloes, Xylum aloes, and Xylo∣aloes. The Druggists do call it Calambu∣cum, Lignum Taprobanum, Lignum paradisi, and Lignum sanctae crucis. In the Bible hath it onely béene called Aloes: it is an
odoriferous kind of wood which is brought out of the Isles of Sumatra, or Taprobana: There are many kindes of it, the heauy∣est is the best, and that which is hard and spotted black, and very sappy, is also taken for the best. Lilly, in greeke and latine Crinon, Lirium, Lili∣um, Rosa Iunonis, or Iunonia Rosa, Nicander calleth it Crinanthemum. The Apothecaries call it for a difference of the others Lilium album, that is the white Lilly: and by the name of Lillies in this booke are alwayes the white ones meant. Liriconfancie or May Lillies, or Lillies of the vallies, of Theophrastus, Lilium vernum, of the Herbarists and common Phisitions Li∣lium conuallium. Some would haue it to bée the Cacalia of Dioscorides, but they are deceiued. The flowers of this herbe are only vsed. Litharge of golde or siluer, Lithargyrium, there are two kinds of it: the first is the Litharge or drosse of siluer, Argyritis, at the Apothe∣caries Lithargyrium argenti. The seconde kind is the Litharge of gold, and it is some∣what redder than the former. There is yet another kinde called of Pliny, Molybditis, & of other Spuma plumbi, that is the scum of Lead. Otherwise it is also called Lithargy∣rum argenti, also Lithargyros, and of Pliny, Spuma argenti, as the Litharge of golde is called of some Spuma auri. These 3. kindes haue the same qualities & operations, yet is the litharge of gold taken for the best; thē the scum of lead; lastly the litharge of siluer. Loadstone, in gréeke of Galen Magnetis, and Heraclia, of Callimachus, Heracleotis, and of Porphyrius, Magnes, as it is also called in la∣tine. It is called of Pliny Sideritis, because it draweth Iron vnto it. Lobster, Cancer marmus. Louage, in gréeke Hipposelnum, in latine Apiū equinum, of Theodorus Gaza, Equapium, of the Herbarists, Pseudoligusticum of the Apothe∣caries and common Phisitions Leuisticum. Because they haue vsed it many yéeres for the true Libysticum, or Ligusticum, therfore will they (according to their old custome) remaine in their error, & will by no meanes be better instructed, let the poore patient speede as he list: Notwithstanding that the true Libysticum of the auncients be in great abundance brought out of Italy, for it groweth verie common in Liguria, and other Prouinces: but diligent and carefull Phisitions do plant the same in their gar∣dens. Others that haue not the true Ligu∣sticum, vse the Angelica for it, or the Oustru∣tium: for both these herbes haue the same virtues with the Ligusticum: the which all Phisitions and Apothecaries ought to imitate, vntill such time as they attaine to the true Ligusticum. If we did so much trouble our selues about the knowledge of herbs and simples, as we do about the ma∣king of Calenders and Prognostications, we might haue this and many simples moe which now we want. The Ligusticum is also called Panacea of Dioscorides. Lupines, in gréeke and latin Lupinus, Thermus, and Faba Lupina. M. MAce in gréeke and latine Macer, Xyloma∣cer, Macis, and Nucis myristicae inuolucrum: It is a well knowen spice, hot and drie by nature. Madder, in gréeke and latin Erythrodanum, of Nicander, Scyron, Rubia, Rubia tinctorum, Ru∣bia infectoria, Vena tinctoria: at the Apothe∣caries Rubia tinctorum, and Ʋena tinctorum. There are two kindes of it, the wild & the tame: the wild groweth euery wherein the woods, & it is much better & fitter for Phi∣sicke than the other, which my self haue ap∣proued to be true at sundry times: the roote is only in vse, for the herb hath smal virtue. Magpie, Pica, and Citta. Malmsey, in greeke and latin Momembrasites, Vinum aruisium, Vinum Creticum, Vinum chiū, and Nicolaus Myrepsus calleth it Vinum Mo∣membrasiaticum, the common Phisitions and Apothecaries call it Vinum maluaticum, and Vinum maruisianum, or Maluisianum. Mallowes, in gréeke Malache, in latin Malua. There are 4. principall kinds of it, whereof the first is the tame Mallow, which grow∣eth in gardens & elswhere: it is called Ma∣lua satiua, Malua hortensis, of the Herbarists Malua maior, Hippomalache, and Malua ca∣ballina: this is the right Mallow, or Malua satiua of the aunciēts, notwithstanding that it groweth in all places of it self. The secōd kind groweth euery where by hedges & dit∣ches, & it is much lesse than the former, it is called in gréeke Malache agria, and in latine Malua syluestris, or Malua agrestis, of ye Her∣barists Chenomalache, Malua anserina, Ma∣lua leporina, and Malua pumila, in English
the lesser Mallows. The third kind is now adaies planted in gardens, and it is called crumpled Mallowes, it is more moyst than either of the former, although that first it came from them; for by the arte of Gardening it is so changed, as many other plants also are. It is called of the Herba∣ristes Malua Romana, or Malua crispa. The fourth kind is called a winter Rose, in greek Moloche, and in latine of Apuleius, Hastula regia, of the Herbarists Rosa transmarina, Rosa hyemalis, Rosa autumnalis: the Apothe∣caries call it Malua arborea. The first two kindes are meane warme and moyst by nature, but the lesser disagreeth some∣what from the other. The crumpled Mal∣lowes are much moyster by nature than the other, and is but seldome vsed in Phisicke, and that because the two first are much stronger. The winter Roses are middle meane warme, but astringent withall, that as the former kinds doe loose the belly, so this doth binde the same: wherefore it is also vsed for the Laske: They therefore do lie falsely, that com∣mend this kinde aboue all the Mallowes of Dioscorides and Galen. Mandrake, Mandragora, Antimelon: this is called of Pythagoras, Anthropomorphos. Maniple is a handfull, or as much as one can hold in his hand, of hearbs, flowers, roots, and such like things, in Greeke Dracos, Dragma, and of the later Grecians Dis∣midion, in latine of Cornelius Celsus, Manipu∣lus, of Scribonius and Marcellus, Fasciculus, of Pliny, Fasciculus manualis. Manna, Melligo, Saliua siderum, Ros syriacus, Mel aerium: of Galen, Aeromeli, Drosomeli, at the Apothecaries Manna, or Manna coe∣lestis, to distinguish it frō the Frankinsence, which is called Manna Libani, and Manna Thuris. There are two kinds of Manna, the one is soft & thin, which is gathered in stone pots, & that is called of Galen lib. tertio de ali∣mentorū facultatibus, the principal Aeromcli, that is, Melaëriū, and Mel libani. The Ara∣bians do cal it for a difference frō the other Tereniabin, & Auerroes Tergebiū. The Sim∣plicists do call it Manna liquida. But now adaies it is neither foūd nor vsed any lon∣ger, as it was wont to be in the time of Ga∣len, & of other writers. This Manna liquida doth Hippocrates call Mel cedrinū. The other kind is drie and hard like Sugar, & is diffe∣ring according to the place where it is col∣lected, so yt the one is called Manna Calibri∣na, & Manna Bombycina, this is brought out of Calabria, & it is accōpted the woorst kind, and it is not so swéete as the other. The o∣ther kind is called Manna Briansona, it is in compacted, hard, & fatty graines, it is also sweeter than the former, and more forcible in operation. The third kind is whiter, and the graines of it are not much vnlike to thē of Mastick, it is also called Māna granata, or granulata, or Mastichina, & it is the very best. Marchasite, in gréek and latine Pyrites, at the Apothecaries Marchasita, it is a minerall stone, it is vsed in Gums & Tinder boxes. There are many kinds of it, whose names do all differ according to the minerall that they containe. Marierom bastard, looke Organy O. Marierom gentle, in greek Sampsychus, in latin Amaracus or Amaracum, of Aegineta and at the Apothecaries Maiorana. Marigold, of Virgil, Columella, and Pliny, Caltha, and of the Herbarists Solsequium aureum, Verrucaria, Caltha poetica, to distinguish it from the Caltha of Dioscorides, which is the Chrysāthemū: it is otherwise called Calendu∣la, & there are 3. kinds of it, to wit, the com∣mon Marigold, that groweth in euery gar∣den, & is called Calendula. The second kinde hath fair great & double flowers, it is called Calēdula multiplex. The third kind is much lesse than both the former, but very like to ye first kind with flowers, leaues, & roots: this kind groweth euery where about Worms, & also about Reingau in ploughed fields, & it is much better & fitter for Phisick than the former, it is called the wild Marigold, Ca∣lendula syluestris, and Aruensis: some call it Calthula, because it is the least of the thrée. Mastick, in greeke and latine Mastiche, Resina lentiscina, and at the Apothecaries Mastix. Maudlinwort, in greeke Chrysocome, and Chry∣sitis, in latine Coma aurea, Aureola, and Ama∣ranthus, of Galen and the Herbarists Amara∣thus luteus, Amaranthus aureus, Tinearia, Sil∣phalithemum, Staechas citrina, Stichas citrina, and at the Apothecaries Stichados citrinum. This herbe is knowen to most men, and is hot and drie by nature. Mault is prepared Barly, wherof the béere is made, it is called in gréeke of Aetius, Byne, and in latine Maltum. May Lillies, or flowers, looke Liryconfan∣cie. L. Marsh garlick, in gréeke & latin of Dioscorides,
Scordium, Scorbium, Dysosmon, and Mithri∣danio, of Apuleius Scordilum, Mithridation, and Haema Ictinos, of the Herbarists Trixago palustris, Trissago palustris, Trixago aquatica, Chamaedrys aquatica, and of Apuleius Sanguis Milui. There are thrée kinds of it: the first is very like the true Germander both in the flower and in the leafe; but that the leaues are somewhat softer and of a light greene colour, and smell like Garlicke: the second kind is much like to the former, but that it is in euery respect somwhat greater: it hath soft leaues somewhat rough & gray, but in smell it is like to ye former. The first kinde is called of the Herbarists Scordium minus, & the second kinde Scordion maius: the third kinde hath a square stalke and white flowers like to the Horehound: the leaues are big and much iagged, the smell is like Garlicke, but not so strong as the other two. Plinius calleth it Scardotis, the Herba∣rists Scordium alterum Plinij, or Scordium Plinianum, Scordiastrum, Marrubium palu∣stre, or Marrubium aquaticum: in English water Horehound. The Apothecaries and such like Southsayers haue taken the wild garlick for ye true Scordium, but how falsely that is apparant enough to all the learned. The first and second kind are vsed promiscuè the one for the other: but it auayleth not, seeing they are both of one operation. The water or marsh Horehound is as yet vn∣knowen at the Apothecaries and not vsed at all. The Scordium is vsed in many com∣positions. Maidenhaire, in gréek and latine Adianthum, Polytrichon, Gallitrichon, Ebenotrichon, Capil∣lus Veneris, Supercilium terrae, & Herba Capilla∣ris. There are two kindes of it: the first is called Adianthum nigrum, or Adianthum gal∣licum, bicause that it is brought out of Fraunce vnto vs: all the English names (as Venus haire, Maydenhaire, &c.) are proper vnto this kind, and whensoeuer you finde either of them in any compositions, then shall this kind alwaies be vnderstood: the second kind is called Adianthum album: it is a common & well knowen herbe here and elsewhere: some men call it Onopteri∣um, Filicula Asellorum, Ruta muraria, and Saluia vitae. Looke in V. for Venus haire. Meade or Hony water, in greeke Hydromeli, Melicratum, and in Latine Aqua mulsa. Medler trée, Mespilus. Melilot, it is called of ye Herbarists Melilotus Nobilis, Herba flauea, Herba leporina, Meli∣lotus coronata, Sertula regia, and Corona re∣gia. It is a well knowen herbe, it groweth in high medowes & hils about a span and a halfe in height (to wit in the Low-coun∣tries) with small Clauers; it hath a fine yellow flower which doth both smel & taste like hony; it is not much vnlike the flower of peason. It is vsed euery where in steed of the true Melilotus of the auncients, because it hath the same vertues and operations that are ascribed to their Melilotus. But in all Germany is the Saxifragium luteum most vsed, and the Melilotus Saxifragus, and Trifolium vrsinum, which Dioscorides doth call Lotus Libyca, Lotus syluestris: this is much more forcible than the common Me∣lilot as hath béen approoued. And although this kind be Melilotus syluestris with Diosco∣rides; yet there is another kind of it, to wit, Melilotus Auicennae, whereof hee maketh two kinds, the one with white, & the other with yellow flowers; both which do smell very swéet & are altogither bitter in taste; yet do they digest and bind, which qualities Dioscorides and Galen do also ascribe to their Melilot: wherefore it is aduised to take the great Melilot Auicennae, and it is vsed at the Apothecaries. The white Melilot is not common in all countries, wherefore it is sowen in gardens in many places. The white is called at the Apothecaries Meli∣lotus alba, and the yellowe Melilotus lutea, the Herbarists do thus distinguish it from Lotus satiua, they call it Lotus alba, Lotus lu∣tea, as they also call the Lotus satiua, and Lo∣tus caerulea. Serapio hath also his proper Me∣lilot, to wit the lesser Vitches, which after the flower is fallen away it getteth little huskes like bird clawes. Some do vse the lesser small Melilot that grow in medows, which is something lesse than the common Melilot, calling it Melilotus minor, we call it the lesser Melilot. Diosc. calleth his Melilot that groweth in Campania, Sertula Campa∣na, and Cato, Serta Campana. Melons, Melon, Melopepon, and Melo. Mithridate, Antidotus Methridatica, Methri∣datium, and at the Apothec. Methridatum. It is a pretious confection against all poy∣son which first was made by King Mithri∣date, and hath called it by his owne name. Mewe, Anethum syluestre, Anethon vrsinum, A∣nethum tortuosum, and Meum: some do call it Seseli Creticum, but care not for them, for it
is the true Meum of the auncients, as euery one may see and find to be without deceipt, that shal cōfer it with ye description of Dios. Milke Thistle, in Greeke and Latine Chamae∣leon niger, and at the Apothecaries Cardo∣patium, some do also call it Carlina nigra. Mill dust, in Gréeke Polleu, Farina volatica, at the Apothecaries Farina volatilis. Mill stone, Lapis molaris, of Virgil Lapis incusus. Millet, in Gréek Cenchros, of Strabo Cenchris, of Hippoc. Paspale: it is euery where in Germa∣nie well knowen, & is daily vsed in meates. Millet of Indie, it is called in Latine Melica, of Plinie Milium Indicum, of the Herbarists Panicum Indicum, Meliga, Sorghum, and Sag∣gina. The Portingales call it Milium sabur∣tum. It is a plant not much vnlike to the Sugar canes, and beareth a browne seede like a Lettice, but somewhat sharpe. It is now a dayes sowen in gardens. Miscledene, in Gréeke of Plinie Ixos, and of Vir∣gil Astilis, of Hesichius Stear, Stelis, in Latin and of Virgil Viscum. It is an excrescence of trées, and groweth commonly on Peare and Apple trees: also on the Hawthorne trée and Birch trées: but that which grow∣eth on Okes, Tillet trées, Chestnut trées, or Hasels, is commended aboue the rest in Phisicke. It is vsed for the falling euill and swimming of the head. Mosse, in Gréeke Bryon, Sphagnon, Mnion, and Amnion, in Latine Muscus, Muscus arbo∣rum, and Lanugo arborum: at the Apothe∣caries and of the Arabians Vsnea. Mouse, Mus, a domesticall animall. Mouse-eare, Auricula muris. The herbs that are called Mouse-eare are 4. in number, al∣though there be but one of them that is cal∣led so of the auncient writers: the first and greatest kind is called of some Mouse-eare, others Lungwort: it groweth commonly in darke Béechen woods & old wals, it hath broad rough & hayrie leaues that lie downe flat on the grounde, and a stalke that is di∣uided into three or fower sprigs, on the top whereof are yellow flowers: this stalke being squised it yeeldeth a white milkie iuice like to the wild Lettice: the Chirur∣gians do call it Lactaria consolida: the Her∣barists Pilosella maior, Auricula Muris ma∣ior, and Pulmonaria Gallica, because it also serueth for the disease of the lights. The second kinde is called Pilosella media, and Pilosella, or Mouse-eare, by which name it is euery where knowen as also in this Booke it is called no otherwise. The thirde kinde is called the lesser Mouse-eare, of the Herbarists Flos Angelicus, and Pilosella minor. It groweth in barren groundes, it hath faire white and pur∣ple flowers. The fourth kinde is called the blewe Mouseare or blew Eyebright, of Dioscorides Myosoris, Auricula muris, and of the Herbaristes Euphrasia carulea, and Auricula Muris caerulea. This herbe is nothing like to the former three kinds in operation and virtue; for the water distilled of it is vsed for the dimnes and bléerdnes of the eies. The auncient Phi∣sitions haue onely vsed it for the bad eies. But our common Mouseare is onely vsed in potions for woundes and ruptures, and such like compositions; notwith∣standing that it hath his proper vse of it selfe. Mouse of the Alpes, Mus Alpinus, whereof the grease is vsed against the lamenes and ex∣tenuation of the ioynts. Mugwort, Artemisia, it is an herbe sufficiently knowen, hot and dry in the second degree. Mulberrie trée, Morea, Sycamin in Greeke, in latine Morus, and Arbor sapiens: the fruit is called Morum, or Mulberrie. Mummye, Mumia: there are two kinds of it, the one is digged out of the Graues in Ara∣bia and Syria of those that are Balsamed, and is brought vnto vs: it is called Pissas∣phaltum factitium, of the Arabians Mumia, at the Apothecaries Mumia. Serapio calleth it Mumia sepulchorum, to distinguish it from this kinde following. The Phisitions call it Mumia Arabum for a difference from Mumia Graecorum. The second kind is onely an equall mixture of the Iewes lyme, and Bitumen: in Gréeke Pissasphaltum, in Latine Picibitumen, and of the Simplicists Cera montana, Cera terrestris, Pissasphaltum nati∣num, and Mumia natiua. But as often as Mummie is named in this present worke, is not the Iewes lime meant, but ye Mum∣mie of the Arabians, to wit Mumia sepul∣chrorum, which is found at all Apothecaries vnder the name of Mumia. Muscadine, Vinum Apianum, Vinum Mus∣acatulum, Ʋinum Muscatellinum, and Mus∣catellum. Muske, Muscus, Moscus, Muschus, it is the dryed matter of the impostume of a certaine beast which is called of the Bar∣barians Gazella.
Must, in Gréeke Gleucos, and Deucos, in La∣tine Mustum, and vinum Musteum, the wine first prest out of the grape is called of Colu∣mella, Mustum Lixiuium, of Plinie Protropion. This wine was woont to be inclosed in Tunnes, and they well hooped, to the end it should not clarifie, and that it might cōti∣nue swéete. It is called of some Vinum co∣actum: it is called of the Grecians Aigleu∣ces, that is, semper mustum. It is often vsed for physick but very seldome alone. Mustard, in Gréeke and Latine Sinapi, Napi, and Sinapis. There are two kinds thereof, the wilde and the tame Mustard. They are both of them hot and dry in the fourth de∣grée: the tame kinde is more commended for physick than the wilde. Mustard séede the white, or Rocket, in Gréeke Eusomus, or Eusomum, in Latine Eruca: there are foure kinds of it, the first kind is sowen in gardens, and is knowne euery where by the name of Rocket, or white Mustard seede: this is the true Eruca and Eusomum of the auncients. The second kind groweth of it selfe in the fields, not vnlike the former, but somewhat lesse; it is called of the Herbarists Eruca syluestris, with vs, wild rocket. The other two kinds, to wit, the third, and fourth, do grow about the water side, and haue much bigger leaues than the former, whereof many leaues lye downe flat on the ground about the stalke: the one beareth white, the other yellow floures, they are called of the Herbarists Erucae aquaticae, Eruculae marinae, in English water rocket. Mynts crumpled, Menta crispa, Mentha satiua or Mintha, it is hot in the third, and dry in the second degrée: the Greekes do call it Hedyosmum. N. NArcissus, in Greeke and Latine Narcissus. There are three kindes of it, the first is sufficiently knowne by the name of Nar∣cissus, the Herbarists do call it Rhodionarcis∣sus, and Narcissus Roseus, this is the true Narcissus. The second kind is very like the former, but it is somewhat bigger in euery respect, it is called of Theophrastus Leucoium, that is viola alba, and this kind is most of all vsed at the Apothecaries. The third kind is like the first in leafe and roote, but a little bigger, and the floure is yellow, the Herbarists call it Narcissus Autumnalis, but this is only to be vnderstoode of the floure ye groweth in haruest without any leaues. The rootes of it is called Colchicum, and E∣phemerum, as hath béen sayd of the Hermo∣dactyles. Nep, at the Apothecaries Menta felina, Catta∣ria, it is vsed of diuers men for Calamintha montana, because it hath the same virtues, so that it may be done without any harme. Nettles, that do burne, or burning nettles, Vrtica pungens, vrtica vrens. Nettles, in Gréeke Acalyphe, Acalephe, Cnide, in Latine Vrtica, there are thrée kindes of them, first, the great and common burning nettle which is knowne to all men, this is called Vrtica mas, or Vrtica maior. The se∣cond kinde groweth not with vs, but must be sowen in gardens, this bringeth her séed in heads like to Flax, and indéede it is not vnlike to Lineséed, but that it is somewhat lesse and whiter. This nettle is called of Dioscorides and Plinie, Vrtica syluestris, and of the Herbarists vrtica Romana, vrtica Ita∣lica, vrtica foemina. The séede of this nettle is more fit for physick than the former, and it is also more forcible. It is called the Ita∣lian, Romish, or Garden nettle vrtica hor∣tulana: notwithstanding that beforetimes it hath béen taken for the wild nettle. The third kinde is the lesser and hoter of all, Plinie calleth it Cania, and the Herbarists vrtica minor. The seedes of all kindes of nettles are hot in the end of the first, and dry in the second degree: the rootes & leaues do warme, resolue, and discusse. Nettles, stinking or dead nettles, Vrtica iners, vrtica mortua, vrtica labeo, Anonium, there be commonly foure kinds of it, they are cal∣led in Gréeke of Dioscorides Galiopsis, and of Plinie, Galeopsis, Galeobdolon, or Galephos, in Latine Vrtica labeo, vrtica foetida, in English stinking nettles. The second kind is bigger and hath yellowish floures, it is called of the Herbarists Archangelica, and archange∣lica lutea, or Anonium luteum, it is also a kind of Lamium, (although Plinie do describe but one kind of Lamium) and is called the yel∣low archangell. The third kind hath white floures, the leaues are altogether like to ye nettle leaues, wherfore they are also called dead nettles: it is called of Plinie and of the Herbarists Lamium album, to distinguish it from the former, Archangelica alba, vrtica mortua, vrtica iners, vrtica lactea, and Ano∣nium
album. The latter Chirurgions do call it Herba panaritij: this is the right Lamium Plinij, and vrtica mortua, dead Nettles, or white archangell. The fourth kind is a pre∣tie herb, not vnlike to the nettle, with faire purple floures, with a strong smell like to baulme; it groweth in thickets and woods, it is called of Plinie vrtica Herculanea, or vrtica Herculea, vrtica odorata, also vrtica scarlata, and that by reason of her strong and pleasant smell, they are also called wood nettles, vrtica syluatica. Héere is to be noted, that when dead nettles are any where prescribed, that you must take the white archangell vrtica lactea. O. OAke, Quereus, Arbor Iouis. Oates, in Greeke and Latine Bromus, and Auena. Oleander, in Greeke Rhododendron, Nerium, Rhododaphne, the Herbarists do call it in Latine Laurus rosea, rosea arbor, Rosago, O∣leander, and Oleandrum. It is a trée with greene leaues like to the Bay trée, but the leaues are somewhat longer and lesser, not much vnlike to the leaues of the Oliue. It beareth a pleasant horseflesh coloured rose, and is planted in gardens. It is hot in the beginning of the third, and dry in the se∣cond degrée. Oliue tree, Olea, and Oliua. There are two kinds of it, the tame, and the wild Oliue, the tame is named as before: the wild is called in Greeke and Latine Agrielaea, Co∣tinus, and olea siluestris: the tame Oliue is called of Virgill Palladia arbor. Onion, in Gréeke and Latine Crommyum, Ce∣pa, Cepe, and Caepe indeclinabiliter. There are many kindes of it, to wit, long, round, great, and small Onions, red, browne, and yellow: the long ones are much stronger than the round, and the yellow stronger than the white. Plinie deuideth them into two kinds, the one doth he call Cepa condi∣mentaria, and hath no head at all, but the tops are only vsed, and it is called Cepa pal∣lacana. The other kinde is called Cepa Capi∣tata. Amongst all onions, are greatest ac∣counted ye best for meate, they that are flat like Turneps: they are called Cepae Africa∣nae. Next after them are the spanish onions, but they are lesse, longer, and sharper, yet bigger than any onions in this countrie. There are also two kinds of them, the one is red, & the other white, but whensoeuer thou wilt vse onyon seeds in any composi∣tion, then shalt thou take the seeds of our onions, for that is much more fit for Phi∣sick, but the Spanish onions are better for meate. Orage, in Greeke Atraphaxis, and Chrysola∣chanum, in Latine Atriplex, Atriplexum, and olus Aureum, it is a common potherb, cold in the first, and moyst in the second degree. Orange tree, Narantia malus. Orange of Athenaeus, in Greeke Chryseon, of Nicander Nerantzion, of Virgil Aureum ma∣lum, and of the common people Malum Ne∣rantium, pomum Arangiae, Arantium, and Aurantium. Organe, grosse or course Marierom, in greeke and latine Origanus, or Origanum, Conila, and Cumila gallica of Apuleius. There are 3. kinds of it, the first is called in Spanish Dosten, in latine and gréeke Origanus Hera∣cleotica, or Origanum Heracleoticum, of Mes∣ues Origanum Persicum, and of the Simpli∣cists Origanum Hispanicum, because it is brought vnto vs out of Spayne: but we needed not to fetch it in Spayne, if we did but looke about vs heere in Germany, we should find this noble herb Dosten in a suffi∣cient quantitie heere: but our nature and disposition is such, that we must alwayes haue some new-fangle, and to forsake that which is present with vs. This course Marierom, or Dosten hath small and smooth leaues like to the common course Marie∣rom, the floures are also very like it, but it groweth somewhat higher, it hath a plea∣sant aromaticall smell, nothing like to the common course Marierom, it groweth in great abundance néere the Rhene on the hils. The second kind of course Marierom is brought vnto vs out of Candia, & it hath white leaues like the spanish Dosten, it is like to the wilde Marierom, both by the stalke, floure, and also by the hairines, so that there is no other difference betwéene the spanish Dosten and our wilde Marie∣rom, but that the Dosten of Candy is some∣what subtiler in sight, and something more pleasant in smel than the other, which must be ascribed to the nature of the countrie, because yt the Dosten groweth there in the fields, and ours must be planted and sowen in Gardens: for we do finde the same by o∣ther
plants that do also grow in fields with vs, that they which grow abroad are much strōger then they which are set in gardens, although they be greater & more pleasant to sight. This kind of course Marierom or Organe is called of Dioscorides and others in Gréeke and Latine Onitis, Origanus oni∣tis, and of the Herbarists Maiorana sylue∣stris, Sampsychus syluestris, Origanum asininum, Ouriganum, and at the Apothecaries Origa∣num creticum. They that vse our wild Mar∣ierom when that of Candy cannot be had, erre not at all, for it is one & the same herb. The third kinde groweth also in Candy, and is set in gardens with vs: it hath com∣monly fiue or sixe stalks growing out of one roote, the leaues are very like to the wilde Thyme, and the floures like Penny∣royall, it smelleth also very well, it is called in Greeke Tragoriganus, in Latine Tragori∣ganum, and Origanum hircinum. The fourth kind is our common Marierom, sufficiētly knowne by that name, it is called in gréeke Agrioriganus, in latine Origanum syluestre, and of the Herbarists Organum panaceum. Note, that if you finde course Marierom in any composition, then is ye Spanish Dosten to be taken for it, which is called Origanum Heracleoticum. Otter, in Greeke Enydris, in Latine Lutra. Oxe, Bos. Oxymel, is a syrupe made with Vineger and Hony. Oyle of Spikenard, Oleum Spicaenardi, and Oleum Nardinum. Oyster, in Gréeke & Latine Ostreum, of Plinie Ostrea, it is a kind of shell fish. P. PAlma Christi, in Gréeke Cici, craton, seseli cyprion, pentadactylon, and of Erodotus, cilli∣cyprion, in Latine of Plinie, Ricinus, Trixis, & Sesamum agreste, of the Herbarists Palma Christi, and Manus Christi, of the Apothe∣caries Cataputia maior. The Arabians do call it Cherua, Kerua: it is a plant common almost in euery garden. The séede whereof is called granum regium, it is hot and dry in the second or third degrée. Panick, in Gréeke Elymus, and Melymus, in Latine Panicum, and Panigo. Parchment, Membrana, and charta pergamena. Parsnep, in Gréeke Staphylinus, in Latine Pa∣stinaca, of the Simplicists Carotis, & Carota. There are foure especiall kindes of it, the first hath yellow rootes, and they are called yellow carrots, of the Herbarists Staphyli∣nus luteus, Carotis lutea, and pastinaca lutea, this is the most common sort of all the tame kinds, and it is the true pastinaca satiua, but I trouble not my selfe with them that séeke to place another kind in stead of it, thereby to couer their grosse errours, if they did looke on the true signes that Dioscorides ascribeth vnto it, they would soone be led from that their blindnes, although they were but children in iudgement. The se∣cond kind of these rootes is very like to the former, but that it is altogether white, and is called of the Herbarists Carotus alba, sta∣phylinus albus, pastinaca alba, in English a Parsnep. The third kinde are the garden Parsneps, these are most like to the two former in leafe, roote, and floure. But the roote is of a darke red colour, which yéel∣deth also a iuice of a darke red colour, but in tast it is altogether like the foresaid. This is the true Pastinaca nigra of Theophrastus, of the Herbarists, Staphylinus ruber, Pastinaca rubra, Carotis rubra, we call them red ca∣rots. These three kinds are comprehended vnder the name of Pastinaca satiua of Dio∣scorides: yet they that would haue the tame Parsnep with the broad leafe to be a kinde of stone Parsly, because it is sweete in tast, I could wish they would bethinke them∣selues otherwise, for they two are as like, as the Firre tree is to the Boxe tree. This is the true Elaphoboscum Dioscoridis, as e∣uery one must confesse that readeth the de∣scription of it: Dioscorides doth also call it Ophioctonum, Corui ocellus, & Pabulum cerui. The Herbarists do call it Pastinaca ceruina, but especially the wild kind that groweth of it selfe in hilly medowes, and is most like to the tame kind, differing only in the place where they grow: also the wild kind is fitter for Phisick, although they be both vsed for meate. The fourth kind is the wild Parsnep, and it groweth euery where in the Vineyards and corne fields, it is much like to ye tame, or garden Parsnep, the roote is whiter, and sharper in tast than of the o∣ther, the floures are white, and of the tame kinde yellow: they that know the wilde Parsnep may also know the tame kinde very well, and may soone perceiue the er∣rors of others: it is called wild yellow car∣rots, or Parsnep. This is that Parsnep
that all authors will haue vsed in phisicke: the Herbarists do call it Pastinaca erratica, Staphiiinus erraticus, Carotus syluestris: the Apothecaries do call it Baucia; others (but vniustly) Daucus, and would make Baucia and Daucus to be one and the same. Partridge, Perdix. Pauls Betonie, Betonica Pauli, Veronica, it is a common herbe and dayly vsed. Peach trée, Persicus. Peare trée, Pyrus. Pearles, in Gréeke Margarites, Cinaedus, of Theophrastus, & Lucianus, Erythraeus lapis, of Arrianus, lapis Indicus, of Stratius, Ery∣thraeus lapillus, of Ʋirgil, Bacca and Bacca conchea, of Plinie, Ʋnio, of Cicero, Mar∣garita, and of Saint Ierome, Granum ma∣ris rubri, of others Perla: it is a gemme or precious stone well knowne vnto all men. Peason, Pisum: there are diuers kindes of them, but the very best are the Hastings. Peacocke, Pauo and Pauus in latine, of Ouidius, Iunonia auis. Pellitorie of Spaine, in gréeke and latine Py∣rethrum, Pyritis, Pyroton, and Pes Alexandrinus: it is hot and drie in the third degrée.

There are two kinds of it, to wit, the common Pa∣rietary, which is the biggest, and groweth euery where in old wals, and it is called of the Herbarists for a distinction Parietaria maior. The second kind is somewat lesse, and groweth not outright like the former, but créepeth onely along the wals, and hath red and thicke stalkes, like to Purslaine; the leaues are like vnto Purslaine, but thinne, soft and limber. This kind groweth plen∣tifully at Ponte mons, on the cittie walles, and in many other places of Fraunce: also at Coblence néere the Rhene: It is most like vnto the great Pellitorie in vertues and operation, they haue also an abstersiue and astringent qualitie: they are cold and moyst. Penniroyall, in gréeke and latine Glechon, Ble∣chon, Apoleium, Abuolum, and Pulegiun, it is hot and drie in the third degrée. Pepper, in Gréeke Peperi, and in Latine Piper. There are thrée kinds of it, white, blacke, and long pepper, sufficiently knowne to euery body: the white pepper is gathered before it be through ripe, it is much stronger and forcibler than the blacke, it is called Pi∣per album. The blacke is called Piper nigrum. The long pepper is a thing of it selfe, and is called Piper longum. Perwinkle, in gréeke Clematis, Clematis Daph∣noides, Myrsinoides, Polygonoides, Daphnoides, and of Plinie, Chamaedaphne, in Latine Vinca peruinca, Ʋnicordia, Palma Virginea, Corona Virginea, Peruinca, and Viola mortuorum. It is a common herbe, and groweth in sha∣dowy places. There is yet another kind of it, which is set in gardens, it hath a darke blew flower, and it is a little bigger in e∣uery respect than the common sort is. It groweth in diuers places of Fraunce of it selfe, they are both of them hot and drie in the third degrée. Petroleum, in Gréeke Naphta, and of Plu∣tarchus, Naphtas, of Nicolaus Myrepsus, Petraeleon, of Suidas, Pharmacon: in Latine Bitumen liquidum, Bituminis Colamentum, at the Apothecaries Petroleum, and Oleum Petrae. There are two kinds of it, the first is the white, which is brought vnto vs from Naples, and out of Italy: of the blacke kind we haue sufficient store in Ger∣manie in the land of Bitsche, halfe a mile from Werde, in the mountaines, betwéene Haganow and Weysenburch, neare the towne Lamperts loch: there is a spring in a valley, that in Aprill and May yéel∣deth as much of this oyle, that the men in that place may gather as much of it as will serue them all the Winter to burne in their Lampes, and to grease their Cart whéeles with it; of which oyle the Quack-saluers and other such like impostors doe gather and fill great bottels, and then sell it againe in strange countries, as if they had fetched it farre, and had hazarded their liues greatly for to get it: which is little obserued of diuers Phisitions, that will rather employ and apply themselues to the making of prognostications, in the speculations of Astronomie, and in presa∣ging diuers strange matters to come.
Phlegme, Slime, a waterish moysture, in Greeke and Latine Phlegma, some do call it Pituita. Pibble stone or flint, in Gréeke Chalix, and in latine Silex. Pigeon, in Gréeke Peristera and Peristeros, in Latine Columba, and of Catullus, Co∣lumbus. Pilewort, looke Figwort in F. Pils, in gréeke Catapotium, of Hippocrates, Gon∣gylium and Gongylidium, of the common phi∣sitions Pillula and Pilula. Pimpernell the great, Petroselinum and Apium saxatile: It is not our common parsley, which the auncients do call Apium, as shall be shewed in the description of Smallage, but our great Pimpernell is nought else but the true Petroselinum, which grow∣eth commonly on stonie rockes or hilles, and also on walles. The first kind grow∣eth in stonie fieldes; but in Vineyardes there groweth the bigger of the two, and it yéeldeth a yellowish iuice, it hath leaues like to the great parsley: it is called of the Herbarists Pimpinella maior, Tragoseli∣num maius, and Pimpinella Hircina maior, and in English great Pimpernell. The second kind is somewhat lesse, and grow∣eth on grassie hilles, it is called Pimpinel∣la, Pimpinella alba, Tragoselinum, and Pim∣pinella hircina, without any other addition, that is the common Pimpernell. The third kind hath small iagged leaues, almost like to the crumpled parsley; it groweth willingly on stony hilles, walles, and old trées, it hath a very sharpe roote, and is the least of all the other, it is called Tra∣goselinum minus, Tragoselinum petraeum, Pim∣pinella minor, and Pimpinella petraea. Some au∣thors will accompt these herbes amongst the Daucos, but they do abuse them greatly, for they are the right stone parsleys, and haue the same operation with parsley. The last kinde is called the lesser Pimpernell. As often as either parsley séede, roote, or iuice is mentioned in any Composition, then is the greater pimpernell to be vnder∣stood. Pingles, in Gréeke Strobili, Pityides, Nuclei pi∣nei, in Latin Nuces pineae, and of Hippocrates, Coccali. Pistactes, in Gréeke and Latine Pistacium and Pistaceum, of Possidonius, Listacium, of Ni∣cander, Psittacium, at the Apothecaries Pistachium and Fisticum. It is a strange fruite like Hasell nuts that grow in Syriae. The trée that beareth these nuts is called Pistaceus and Pistacius, and it is planted in gardens in Italy, Fraunce and Ger∣manie. Pitch, Pix: there are two kinds of it, to witte, harde or stone pitch, and liquid pitch or tarre. The stone pitch is cal∣led Pix arida, Concreta, seu excocta. The other kinde is called Tarre, in Latine and Gréeke Pissa hygra, Pix liquida, Pix fluida. Plaister, in Gréeke Emplastros, in latine empla∣strum.

There are sixe kindes of Plantaine, whereof the first is the common great plantaine, that groweth in all highwayes and fields, it is knowne sufficiently, and is called for a difference Heptapleuron and Polyneu∣ron, in Latine Plantago maior, of Apulei∣us, Plantago lata, and Septineruia, of the Herbaristes Plantago rubea, Plantago la∣tifolia, and Multineruia. The seconde kinde is called Shéepes tongue, Pentapleu∣ron, Quinqueneruia, Plantago minor, Lin∣gua Agni, and Lingua Ouina, Lingua A∣rietis, and Plantago media. The third kind is called picked plantaine, or Houndes ribbe, in Gréeke Hippopleuron and Cyno∣pleuron; in Latine Plantago acuta, Planta∣go lanceolata, Costa equina, Costa Canina, and Laureola: this kinde groweth in meadowes, it is well knowne to euery body. The fourth kind hath round leaues like the great plaintaine, but they are somewhat lesse and more limber, and each leafe hath but thrée ribbes, it groweth in wooddes, and is called of the Herba∣rists Plantago syluatica, Plantago trineruia, and Plantago latifolia minor. The fift kind is planted in gardens for pleasure, the leaues are like vnto the great plantaine, on the vpper end of the stalke doth it get many little greene leaues, they grow double like vnto a Rose, wherefore it is also called Rose plantaine, or Plantago Ro∣sea. Otherwise they haue the same ope∣rations and vertues with the other plan∣taine.
The sixth kinde groweth in Welles and waterish places, it hath long, broade, and sharpe leaues at the end, it is called water plantaine, of the Herbarists Plan∣tago aquatica, Plantago palustris, and Co∣chlearia palustris. But when thou findest Plantaine in any composition, then shalt thou take the first kinde, or the great plan∣taine. Plane trée: it is not the trée which we call O∣pulus, but Plantanus is a trée that groweth in Italy. Plume allume, in Gréeke and latine Amiantus, Bostrychites, linum viuum, linum saxatile, and at the Apothecaries Alumen plumeum, or Alumen plumosum, which the common Phisitions and Apothecaries do falsly vse for Alumen scissum, which hath no likelihood with any kinde of Allume: I will omit the vertues and operations which it should haue equall with Allume, for they are as like one to another, as an apple is like an oyster. Polypodie, in Gréeke and Latine Polypodium, Filicula, of Cato, Felicula: The roote of it is onely vsed; and when you finde Polipodie with addition, then is the roote onely to be taken. Pomegranate trée, in gréeke Rhoa, Rhaea, & Sida, in latine Malus punica, and of the common phisitions Malus granata. Pomegranates, Rhaea, Sida in gréeke, and in la∣tine Malum punicum, at the Apothecaries Malum granatum and granatum. Pompeon, in Gréeke Pepon, in Latine Pepo. There are many kindes of it, first the com∣mon pompeons, knowne to euery body: secondly, the sugar Melons, Pepo saccha∣rinus, Pepo muscatellinus, and Pepo Tur∣cicus. Poplar trée, in gréeke Leuce, and in latine Po∣pulus. Poppie, Papauer satiuum. There are two kindes of it, to witte, the white and the blacke poppie, the white is called of Di∣oscorides, Thylacites, and Papauer satiuum, or Hortense: and at the Apothecaries Pa∣pauer album. The blacke which is also placed amongst the tame kindes, is cal∣led of Dioscorides, Pithitilis, and Papauer syl∣uestre, and at the Apothecaries Papauer nigrum; of Hesychius is the white poppie called Cynolephalaeon. The toppe or head is called in Gréeke Codia, in latine Caput Papaueris: the leafe of it is called of Theo∣criti Scoliastes, Platagonion. Note that where∣soeuer Poppie is named alone, to take the white. Priuet, or Primprint, in Gréeke and latine Cyprus, Ligustrum; Auicenna and Serapio do call it Alchanna, Alchenna, Henne, Alkan∣na and Alcanna: But the Druggists and A∣pothecaries doe call the rootes of the red Oxe toong Alcanna: Virgill doth call the flow∣ers of priuet Alba Ligustra: and Columella doeth call the fruite of it Nigra Ligustura. This plant is very common in all Europe. The leaues, flowers, and berries are in vse, and they haue an astringent and drying qualitie. Purslaine, in gréeke Andrachne, in latine Por∣tulaca, and Porcellana: it is colde in the third and moyst in the second degree. Pineapple, in Greeke and latine Strobilus and Conus. Pionie, in Gréeke and latine Paeonia, Peu∣torobum, Glycyside, of Apuleius Glycysis, and Paeonium, Orobelium, Orobax, Hae∣magonum, Paesaede, Menogenium, Meni∣um, Panthiceratos, Aglaophotis, and of Aelianus, Aglaophotis terrestris, Cynospa∣stus, Dactylus Idaeus, Theodonium, Sele∣nium, Selenogonum, of Theophrastus, Dicho∣menium, of Apuleius, Gludis, Rosa Fatui∣na, of Dioscorides, Herba Casta, and of Iosephus Historicus, Baaras. Dioscorides doth also call it Phthisis, and Auerroes Rosa Asinorum. The Herbarists doe call it Rosa benedicta, Rosa sancta, Rosa luna∣ris, or Lunaria, Rosa regia, and Rosa basili∣ca. There are three kindes of it, which are all planted in gardens: of the first kinde, to witte, of the female, there be two sortes, the one with faire darke red flowers, and many knottie rootes, a∣bout the thicknesse of ones thumbe, and some lesse, much like to Acornes: this is knowne euery where. This kinde is cal∣led of Dioscorides, Paeonia foemina, and Dactylus Idaeus. The other kinde is like to the former, but the leaues are some∣thing lesse, and iagged, not so deepe, and of a light gréene colour, and paler than the other: the rootes are also longer and paler than the other, almost like to the male Pionie, so that it seemeth to be a mixture betwéene both male and female. Dioscorides maketh no mention of it,
but Plinie calleth it Pionia mascula, and the Herbarists Paeonia foemina altera, and Paeo∣nia promiscua. The third kind is like to the first, with leaues and rootes, the flowers are redde as blood, faire, great and double, it is called Paeonia multiplex. The fourth kinde hath leaues like to the Walnut trée, the flo∣wers are like to the former in colour, but something lesse, the roote is white, thicke, long, and deuided into two, it smelleth very strong and pleasant. This is the true male Pionie, Paeonia mascula, of the auncient writers. Aetius and others do call it Ephi∣altia and Ephialtium, of the Herbaristes Paeonia alba, and Herba Diui Ʋalentini, we call it the white Pionie: This kinde is al∣wayes to be vsed, or else the compounded kind before named in the stéed thereof. Q. QVicke lime, in Gréeke Conia and Asbestos, in Latine Calx viua, Plinie calleth it Fer∣rum caementorum. Quicksiluer, it is called in Gréeke and Latine Hydrargyron, Argentum aqueum, and Ar∣gentum viuum, of the Alchymists Mercu∣rius: it is a minerall knowne to euery body. There are two kindes of it, the one is found in the mynes, which is called Hydrar∣gyron natiuum: the second kinde is made of Sinople, and it is called Argentum viuum, or Hydrargyron factitium. The Alchymists doe adde yet thrée other kindes vnto the former, the one made of Lead, which they do call Mercurius Saturni: the other made of Tinne, which they doe call Mercurius louis, or Fel Draconis: the third kinde is made of golde, which they call Mercurius solis, or Ʋiscum solis: But the two first are onely vsed in phisicke, and the three last kindes, to wit, of Tinne, lead, and golde, we doe commit and commend to the Al∣chymists. Quinces, in gréeke and latine Cydoneum, and of Hesychius, Lasiomalum, of Nicander, Chnoaum, of Plinie Malum lanatum, of Virgil Malum canum, of others Cotoneum, Malum Cotoneum, malum Cydonium, and at the Apo∣thecaries Cydonium and Cittonium. There are thrée kindes of them, the lesser yellow Quinces that are so odoriferous, are most common and most fit for phisicke. The other kind is bigger and longer like a peare, and in colour pale yellow, much slighter both in taste and smell than the former: this kinde is called in Greeke and Latine Struthium and Struthiomelum: the Sim∣plicistes doe call it Cydonium maius, Coto∣neum maius, and Pyrum Cydonium. The third kinde is the middle sort: both the for∣mer are graffed from a tree on a stalke of a∣nother, this kind is called of Plinie Malum milianum, and of the Simplicists Cydonium, or Cotoneum nothum, with vs the bastard Quince. The first and least are the very best, then the bastard Quinces, and the worst are the greatest. R. RAdish, in Gréeke and Latine Raphanus, or Raphanis, Radix and Radicula. Ragwort, Dogs stones, Gandergrasse, in Gréeke Satyrion, of Apuleius Panion, in La∣tine Satyrium, of Mesues, Testiculus Ʋulpis, and of Apuleius, Testiculus Leporinus. There are two kindes of it knowne to Dioscorides, but we haue many kindes with vs which we do know, amongst which Orchis and Orchis Serapias are placed. Theophrastus Plinius and Apuleius haue comprehended them vnder the name of Satyrium, and confounded them together. The first and true Satyrium is called of Dioscorides in Gréeke Satyrion triphyllon, or Satyrium tri∣folium. The second kinde is called redde Ragwort, of Dioscorides in Greeke Saty∣rion Erithronicon, Satyrium Erithraicum, and Satyrion Erythron, of Apuleius, Entaticum, Priapicum, and Satyriscus: in Latine Molor∣ticulum Ʋeneris, Melium aquaticum, Testicu∣lus Satyri, and Arrectorium. The third kind is called Satyrium regium, or Satyrim basili∣cum, of the Herbarists Manus Christi, Pal∣ma Christi, and Palma Ʋeneris, the Arabi∣ans doe call it Bucheiden and Buzeiden, of Auicenna, Digitus crinitus, Satyrium basilicum maius mas. The fourth kinde is like to the former, but the leaues are ful of spots, it is called of the Herbarists Satyrium Basilicum maius foemina, and Lacryma Mariae. The fifth kinde hath small leaues like to Saf∣fron, it beareth a faire purple flower with a pleasant smell: the rootes are also like the two other small hands. The Herbarists do call it Satyrium basilicum, or regium minus, Satyrium odoratum, Amaranthus vencris,
Palma Christi minor, Palmula Christi, or Pal∣mula Ʋeneris. The sixte kinde hath leaues like to the white Lilly, but narrower and lesser, it hath two kinds of flowers, the one is of a darke red colour, like to that of Hart∣wort, the other as white as snow. This kind hath two rootes of the bignesse of an Oliue, and very swéete in taste: Dioscorides calleth it in Gréeke Orchis and Cynosorchis, in Latine Testiculus, and Testiculus canis: the Herbarists doe call it Orchis maior mas. The seuenth kind is somewhat like the first, but that the leaues be lesse, it beareth a flo∣wer of a Chestnut colour, it is called of the Herbarists Orchis mas minor. The eight kind hath soft leaues, not vnlike the Lilly leaues, but somewhat lesse; the flowers are partly of a darke red colour, and partly incarna∣tion, with many white strakes, the rootes are like Cockes stones, it is called of the Herbarists Orchis foemina maior. The ninth kind is much lesse than the former, but very like the same in flowers, leaues and rootes, it is called of the Herbarists Orchis foemina minor. Some do call it Orchis odorata or Te∣sticulus odoratus, it groweth on drie hils. The tenth kind hath lesser leaues than the white Lillies, the flowers are purple, it hath thrée rootes, much lesse than Oliues, whereof two are of one bignesse, and the third lesse and longer, so that these thrée are like the mem∣ber of a man. It is called in Gréeke of Dios∣corides Orchis serapias, of Aegyneta Triorchis, of Apuleius Serapion. Yet are there thrée kindes moe, whereof we haue spoken else∣where. Otherwise there is another kind of this herb, which is placed with the Cynosor∣chis, or Testiculus canis, which here for breui∣ties sake we doe omit. The Apothecaries doe vse all the former kindes of Ragwort for Satyrium, without any difference: and although there be but a small difference be∣twéene all these kindes in operation, yet it were better onely to vse that which hath thrée leaues like Lillies for the true Saty∣rium, for it is the Satyrium of the auncient Phisitions, to the end no error be commit∣ted. All these beforenamed herbs and rootes are hote and moyst, and haue an attractiue vertue. Raisons, in Gréeke Astaphides, and Staphides, in Latine Ʋuae passae, at the Apothecaries Passulae. There are thrée kindes of them in vse: the first kind is the best, and are called Ʋuae damascenae, and Ʋuae zibebae, at the Apo∣thecaries Zibebae, and Passulae damasceuae. The second kind is somewhat lee, they are brought from Cypers, Spaine, and Pro∣uence, they are the best in vertue and ope∣ration, and also in taste, and are called of the Phisitions Ʋua passae maiores, Ʋuae massilio∣ticae, at the Apothecaries Passulae maiores. The third kinde are the Currans, and are called in Gréeke Apyrine, in Latine Vuae passae Corinthiacae, Passulae Ciliciae, Passulae Cheme∣sinae, that is, Passulae sine nucleis, and at the A∣pothecaries Passulae minores: but when we find in any composition Passulae, then are these to be taken. The Arabian phisitions call them Kesmes & Chesmes, that is, Raisons without stones. Ramme, in Gréeke Crios, and in Latine Aries. Rapes, in Gréeke Gongyla, Gongylis, in Latine Rapa, Rapum, and Golsonium is called in Greeke Raphys, and Rapys. These Rapes or Turneps are of foure kindes, for some are round, some long, some white, some small, some great, but we néede not make any long rehearsall of them, séeing they haue all one kind of operation. There are certaine Turneps sowne in Lottering, and in the vpper Burgundie, to the end to make oyle of their séedes, but this kind of Turneps is wilde, and altogether vnfit for meate, but the séede is more fit for phisicke than that of the tame Rapes. This kinde is called in Gréeke Gongylis agria, and in Latine Rapum syluestre. Rapontica, in Gréeke and latine Centaurium magnum, Maro, Maronia, and of Apulcius Maronium, Plectronia, Pelethronia, Chiro∣nia, and of the Magicians Sanguis Herculis, Limnestis, Nessium, Ʋnefera: the Herba∣rists do call it Pseudoraponticum, at the Apo∣thecaries is it vnto this day falsely called Rhaponticum, and Rhapontica, because their vnskilfull phisitions do take it to be ye same, where neuerthelesse the true Rhaponticum may be had sufficiently. But these blinde bayards haue so dazelled their eyes with gazing at the starres, that they are blinde though they seeme to see, and they do draw and hold other men into their errors. The true Rapontica is a roote outwardly darke, gray, and lesse than the common Rapon∣tica, and spongeous: also being broken, it hath many white veines much like to Ru∣barb, with an astringent taste, it is brought vnto vs from Pontus. This is in vse a∣mongest curious and carefull Phisitions.
It is called with vs pontish Rubarbe, to distinguish it from the roote of the great Centorie, which we do commonly call Ra∣pontica. It is called in Gréeke Rha, Rheon, Rheum, in latine Raponticum, Rapontica, Rheum ponticum, Rheon ponticum, of Plinie Rhacoma or Rhecoma, of Celsus Radix pon∣tica. Rhapontium, it is called of the Herbarists Ra∣puntium, Rapontium, Rapunculum, Raponcel∣lus, Raponculus, and Pes locustae, it is a kinde of wilde Rapes, of which there is yet ano∣ther kind, it groweth commonly in shaddo∣wie woods, it hath round leaues below, and beareth a browne purple and hairy flower, and a thicke roote, it is very sweete in taste as the former also is, they are both vsed in sallads and in meates. The second kind is called the wilde Rapuntium, the Herbarists do call it Rapontium, Rapunculus syluaticus, and Rapontium Alopecorum. Raspes, at the Apothecaries Ribes, it is a kinde of Ceanothus Theophrasti, which we doe call Gooseberries, and they are like in euery res∣pect, but that the Raspes hath no thornes, and they may be vsed in stead of the Goose∣beries. The Raspes are cold and drie in the second degrée. Rauen, in Gréeke Corax, in latine Coruus. Red Arsenicke or Orpiment, Sandaraca Graeco∣rum, and at the Apothecaries Auripigmentum rubrum. Red lead, in Gréeke Sandix and Syricum, in la∣tine Minium secundarium, of Vitruuius Sanda∣racha, at the Apothecaries Minium, of Dios∣corides and Pliny also Minium. It is our Si∣nople Cinnabaris Metallica, but red lead is made of lead, which is burned or calcined vntil it be red. This is vsed most commonly in salues and plaisters, and especially in the vnguentum Syricinum mesuis, which the vn∣skilful sort do call vnguentum Sericinum, and they do suppose that Syricum should be Seri∣cum, and so in stead of red lead they put silke into salue. Red Poppie, Corne Roses, in Gréeke Mecon Rhoeas, and Oxygonum, in latine Papauer er∣raticum, of Geza Papauer fluidum, and of o∣thers Papaueralis and Papauerina, of the Her∣barists Papauer caducum, Papauer puniceum, Papauer caninum, papauer Rhoeas, rosella, and at the Apothecaries Papauer rubrum. There is another kinde of it very like the former, but much lesse, whereof each flower hath but foure leaues, it groweth in the Rie and Wheate, and it is called the lesser red Pop∣pie: The Herbarists doe call it Papauer er∣raticum minus, Papaueralis, and papauerina mi∣nor, it hath also the same vertues with the former. Réede, in Gréeke and latine Calamus, Arundo, and Harundo, the Apothecaries call it Canna. Plinie in his sixtéenth booke and 36. chapter, and in the 24. booke and 11. chapter, accoun∣teth 29. kindes of them, but we do acknow∣ledge but sixe kindes of them, whereof the first is called Nastos, that is, hard and com∣pact, and smooth betwéene the ioynts, wher∣of the arrowes were wont to be made, it is called Sagittaria Arundo, and Calamus Sagit∣tarius. The second kind is the female, wher∣of the Cornets tongues are made, and it is called of Dioscorides Calamus foemina, and of Plinie Calamus Auliticus. The third kinde is called in Gréeke Syringias, in latine Cala∣mus, and Arundo fistularis, and it is hollow from one end to the other: there are writing pennes made of it, and it is without knots, wherefore it is called Harundo enodis. The fourth kind is also hollow and thick, it gro∣weth in ponds and great lakes, in Gréeke Donax, in latine Harundo Cypria, Calamus Cyprius, Harundo aquatica. The fifth kind is thicke and strong, it is vsed for hedges, it is called in Gréeke Phragmites, and of Theo∣phrastus Characias, in latine Callamus vallaris, and vallatorius, Harundo vallatoria, Harundo sepiaria, and sepicularis. The sixt kind is plan∣ted in gardens in diuers places of Francs and of Germany, it is faire, great, and plea∣sant to sight, it is brought vnto vs from In∣dia, and therefore it is also called Arundo In∣dica. Some call it Spanish Canes or Reed, because it was first brought vnto vs from Spaine. Rice, in latine and Gréeke Oriza, Risum, Ri∣zum, of Theophrastus Orizum, at the Apo∣thecaries Oriza: it is knowne to euery bodie. Rocket, looke Mustard seed the white in M. Roebucke, in Gréeke Dorx, in latine Capreus, of Virgill Capreolus. Rose, in Gréeke Rhodon, of Theocriti Scolia∣stes, and of Homer Thronon, in latine Rosa. There are many kindes of it, to wit, the tame Roses which are planted in gardens, are in number seuen seuerall kindes: of the wilde ones are foure kindes, which is in all eleuen kindes. The first kinde is of a darke bloud red colour, and are common in all
gardens, some are single, some double, and are called of Plinie Rosa milesia, of the Her∣barists Rosa purpurea and punicea. The se∣cond kind is of a light red colour, it is called of Plinie Rosa trachinea, of the Herbarists Rosa rubra: at the Apothecaries and of the common people are they called Rosa rubra, and red Roses without any distinction, nei∣ther skils it greatly, by reason they are all one in vertues and operations. The third kinde is the incarnation Rose with a plea∣sant smell, and are called Prouence Roses, of Plinie Rosa Alabandica, of the Herbarists Rosa prouincials, Rosa persica, Rosa incarnata, and at the Apothecaries Rosa purpurea: this kind of Roses are laxatiue, and are vsed for the laxatiue sirupe of Roses. The fourth kinde are the double white garden Roses, the commonest amongst all tame kindes, and are called Rosa alba. The fifth kind is al∣so white, and hath bin knowne with vs but of late yeares, but they are somewhat lesse, and pleasanter to the sight than the former white Roses are, many of them being dou∣ble grow together vpon one braunch, but sixe of them are scant so bigge as one of the tame ones, yet very pleasant in smell: some do call them white Muske Roses, any other name as yet is not knowne. The sixt kind of tame Roses is the yellow Rose, euery where common and knowne, without any smell, and altogether vnfit for phisicke: the Herbarists do call it Rosa lutea, rosa Aegyptia, rosa Africana, and rosa Vulpina. The seuenth kind are the pleasant Damaske roses, they are called of Plinie Rosa coroneola, of the Her∣barists Rosa moscata, or rosa muscata, Rosa sy∣riaca, rosa Damascena, and rosa Alexandrina. The first kinde of wilde Roses are called hedge Roses or wild Roses, they are called in Gréeke Cynorhodon, of Hesichius Cynocen∣tron, of Galen Cynomoron, in Latine Caniru∣bus, and Rosa canina: some do call it Eglente∣ria and Englenteria. The second kind of wild Roses are much lesse than the first, and are of an incarnation colour like the former, but they are very fragrant, as wel the Rose as the leafe of it: it groweth in hedges and on hilles, and is called of the Herbarists Rosa diuae Mariae, Spina diuae Mariae, Oenorho∣don, vinirosa, and rosa cinamomina. The third kind of wild Roses groweth here and there in tilled fields, and especially in fields of Oates néere the Rhene, it is the very least kind of all wilde Roses, but it hath bigger leaues, inwardly purple coloured, it is cal∣led of the Herbarists Chamaerhodon, Rosa pu∣mila, Rosa Aruensis, and Rosa auenaria. This kind of Roses is so odoriferous, that it see∣meth to excell all tame kindes. The fourth kind of wild Roses is very like the former, they are also white roses without any smel, they blow very late, to wit, in Iune, they grow on drie hils and fields, and are called white field Roses: the Herbarists doe call them Rosa campestris, it is most contemptible of all other kinds. Amongst all these kinds are the double and single red Roses the very best that may be vsed for Phisicke, and in like maner also the Oaten roses: wherefore if one find Roses without any addition in a∣ny mixture, then are the red or Oaten roses to be taken for it. Rosemary, in Gréeke and Latine Libanotis co∣ronaria, of Apuleius, Icteritis, herba Salutaris, and libanotis coronalis, of the Herbarists Den∣drolibanum, Rosmarinus coronarius, and libano∣tis coronaria, to distinguish it from the other kind of libanotis, which is called by them Li∣banotis vmbellifera: the Apothecaries call it Rosmarinus: it is a well knowne plant, and so common in the Prouinces that they mak bauens of it to heate their Ouens withall, and here with vs it groweth onely in gar∣dens. Rosin, Resina pinus, and resina: but Resina is a common name for all gummes, but because that rosin is dayly in vse, it is called resina: the other gums are named with additions: wherfore whensoeuer you find rosin in any composition, then shall you vnderstand the resina pinus. Rubarbe, in Gréeke Rhaeon barbaricon, and Rhae∣onbarbarum, Rhaeumbarbarum, Rhasceniticum, Rhemusceniticum, and Radix barbarica. Rubie, there are sixe kindes of it, the first and most precious is the Carbuncle, which is cleare, fierie, and perspicuous aboue all o∣ther gemmes, it is called in Gréeke Apyrotus and Anthracites, in Latine Carbunculus. The other kinde of Carbuncle is the rubie, a well knowne precious stone, and it is cal∣led Carbunculus, Amethystizon, in Gréeke Anthrax Amethystizon, and Pyropus, and at the Apothecaries Rubinus: this is next the the Carbuncle, and very much vsed. The third kind is the Granate. The fourth kind is somewhat paler than the other former kinds, it is of a light red colour, it is called in high Dutch Ballas, in Gréeke Astrios, or
Asterios, of Augustine in the 21. booke de ciui∣tate Dei, Aster: of the Druggists Balagius, Ballasius, Pallasius, Pallenaea gemma, Ballenaea gmma, Carbunculus candidus, and Spinalus. The fifth kinde is of a yellowish red and light in colour, it is called in Gréeke and La∣tine Lychnis, Lychnites, Carbunculus giluus, and Carbunculus pallidus. The sixth kinde is called Carbunculus alabandicus, and Lapis ala∣bandicus. Amongst all these kinds are onely the Rubie and the Granate in vse for phi∣sicke. Rue, in Gréeke and Latine Peganum, Rhyte, and Ruta. There are foure kindes of it, to wit, two tame, and two wilde: the two tame kindes are so like that they can hardly be distinguished, if one looke not well vpon them, and they are vsed without any diffe∣rence one for the other. The first kinde of wild Rue is called Rue of the mountaines, of Dioscorides, Ruta montana, or Rhyte mon∣tana: this is most like to the garden Rue, but that it is much lesse, it groweth here and there on the hils in Italy, but with vs it is set in gardens. The second kind of Rue groweth in diuers places of Germany of it selfe, and it is also otherwhiles set in gar∣dens: it hath longish leaues, a strong and vnpleasant smell, and white flowers, out of which three square heads do grow that con∣taine the seede, somewhat bigger than those of the common Rue, and by the name of wilde Rue is this commonly vnderstood. The other wild or mountaine Rue, is only called Rue: this last kind is called in gréeke Peganon agrion, of Galen, Moly, Amala, Har∣mal, and Besasa: but Moly is another plant with Dioscorides and Hippocrates. The Her∣barists do call this wild Rue with Dioscori∣des Ruta syluestris. Auicenna and the Arabi∣ans do call it Alharmel, Armel, and Harmel. Some vnskilfull Phisitions do take Hem∣locke for Harmel or Ruta syluestris, and so do they follow their blinde leaders Mathaeus Syluaticus, and Iacobus Manlius, that haue composed the Lumen maius, and haue tran∣slated Harmel for Cicuta, and haue expoun∣ded Armel to be the wild Rue, all which is most false: for it is most true that Armala and Harmala of the Greekes, and Alharmel, Alarmel, Armel, and harmel of the Arabians, is one and the same plant, to wit, wild Rue, which Galen doth call Moly; wherefore these fellowes doe lie falsly, and shall not be able to make answer for it hereafter, that they do mixe the séedes of Hemlocke in the pillulae foetidae and aggregatiuae in stead of the séedes of wild Rue, thereby not only deceiuing the people, but hurting and spoyling them; so that great héede ought to be taken in all places where these pilles are prepared with the seede of Hemlocke in stead of the seede of wild Rue, which I could not omit at this present to shew and make knowne to the Reader; for to vse venome in stead of Rue∣seede is no small errour. S. SAffron, in Gréeke and in Latine Crocus, Crocum, and Cynomorphus, of the Magici∣ans Sanguis Herculis, of Serapius and Aui∣cenna Sahaferam. It is called barbarously Saffranum. The very best Saffron that is to be had in Europe is the Dutch Saffron, which is set about Vienna and Spier in Ger∣manie. Sage, in Gréeke Elelisphacos and Crosmis, in Latine Saluia, of Apuleius Corsaluium. There are foure kindes of it, two tame, and two wilde: the first is called great Sage, or broade Sage, in Latine Saluia maior. The second kinde is the lesser or eared Sage, in Latine Saluia Cruciata, Saluia Auriculatae, Saluia minor, Saluia Acuta, and Saluia nobi∣lis. The third kinde is the first of the wilde Sages, which Theophrastus calleth Sphace∣lus: it groweth commonly among Chestnut trées, and vpon woody hils, it hath greater, rougher, and more wrinkled leaues than the great garden Sage hath, and it looketh as if it were withered with dryeth, it hath a prettie blew flower. The fourth kinde is the second wild Sage, which is knowne to diuers by that name, and is called Saluia Syluestris, Saluia Bosci, Boscisaluia, Scorodiana, Scordiana, of Cordus Scorodiana. By Sage without any addition shalt thou vnderstand the garden Sage. Saint Iohns wort, Hypericon, Perforata and Fuga daemonum, of the Herbarists Ruta Solis, herba Solis, it is a common and wel knowne herbe, hot and drie by nature. Saint Iohns bread, in Gréek Xylocerata, or Xy∣locaracta, at the Apothecaries and of Actua∣rius Carrubia: Others do call it panis diui Io∣hannis, it is the fruite of a trée, longish and swéete, and hath certaine kernels with∣in it.
Sal Armoniac, it is called Sal Armoniacus, or Sal Harmoniacus, and at the Apothecaries Sal Armoniacum. This Salt was wont to be digged out of the Sandes in Africa, and was thence brought vnto vs, which now a dayes we want: But there is another chimicall Salt, made of pisse and other things, vsed in stead of the former, the which of many vnskilfull men is taken and vsed as wel inwardly as outwardly for the right Sal Armoniac; but woe to them that take it inwardly. But because that we can∣not get of the right Sal Armoniac any more, we may vse in this place the stone Salt, or Salt of the mines, which is a kinde of the true Sal Armoniac, and hath also the same vertue and operation. I would with no man to vse the common Sal Armoniac in∣wardly. Sallamander, in Gréeke Molge, in Latine Sa∣lamandra: it is a very venemous worme like to a great Euet, with blacke and yellow spots, it liueth commonly in the water, and poysoneth the same. Salt, Sal. There are foure kindes of it: the common salt is called of Cato Sal popularis. The second, called Sal Marinus, is made of the Sea water, in English bay Salt. The third kinde is Sal palustris. The fourth is stone salt, Sal Fossitius, Sal Crystallinus, or Sal Montanus. Saltpeter, Nitrum. Niter, and Sal Petrae: the Arabians doe call it Baurach, it is a kinde of naturall Salt. Some doe falsly vse the common Saltpeter for it, which is a great deceit. Sanicle, in Latine Sanicula, and Sennicula. There are thrée kindes of it, which now a dayes are called by the names of Sa∣nicle. The first kinde and their true Sa∣nicle, hath leaues like to the Vine, but somewhat lesse, and deuided into fiue se∣uerall partes: it continueth gréene all the winter time, and is knowne by many men by the name of Sanicle, and is pro∣perly called Sanicula, otherwhiles to di∣stinguish it from the other kindes, Dia∣pensia, Sanicula Quinquefolia, Sanicula Ʋiti∣ginea, and Feraria Minor. The seconde kinde groweth on high snowie hilles, and hath fat leaues, not much vnlike to Plan∣taine: The flowers are somewhat like to Cowslips, some blew, some purple coloured: The Herbaristes doe call it Arctocium, Auricula Ʋrsi, Paralytica Al∣pina, Sanicula Alpina, and Arthritica Al∣pina. The thirde kinde of Sanicle grow∣eth on high, wooddie, and colde hilles, it hath leaues almost like Angelica, and a blacke hairie roote. It is called of the Simplicistes Sanicula Foemina, or Astran∣tia nigra, in English shée or female Sa∣nicle. But this hath another operation than the Sanicle, for the roote of it pur∣geth like Ellebore, for which cause it is of some called Sanicula Cathartica. The Herbarists call it wilde Angelica. But where and whensoeuer Sanicle is found in any Composition without any addition, then shalt thou vnderstand the first kinde of it. Saphire stone, in Gréeke and Latine Sapphi∣rus, by Marbodeus Syrtites, and at the Apothecaries Saphirus. There are foure kindes of it, of the blew which is knowne by that name, we haue spoken before. And to distinguish it from the others, it is called Saphyrus Caeruleus; and Dionysius Afer calleth it Cyaneus Saphirus. The seconde kinde declineth somewhat from the blew to the gréene, and is called in Gréeke Prasitis, and Saphirus Prasitis. The Druggistes doe call it Saphirus Ʋiridis, in English, a greene Saphire. The thirde kinde declineth from the blew to the yel∣low, and is called in Gréeke Chrysitis, and Saphirus Chrysitis: of the Simplicists Saphi∣rus Aureus, in English the yellow Saphire. The fourth kinde is betwéene blew and white, in colour like Buttermilke, al∣together perspicuous and cleare, called Sa∣phirus candidus, in English the white Sa∣phire. Sarcocolla, in Latine Sarcocolla, or Caru∣glutinum, at the Apothecaries Gummi Sar∣cocolla, of Serapius and other Arabian wri∣ters Anzarot or Anzarut, it is a gumme of a thorne in Persia much like to Frankin∣sence. Sauery, in Greeke and Latine Thymbra, Cunila, and Satureia: there are two kindes of it, and there is no difference betweene them both, but that the wilde kinde gro∣weth of it selfe, and is called Thymbra, and Cunila Rustica. The other kind is planted in gardens, and is more sauourie and ac∣ceptable to meate than the former: but for phisicke, the wilde hath more vertue than the other. It is hot and drie in the third de∣grée.
Sauine or Sauine trée, in Gréeke Bathy, Bra∣thus, Brathrum, and Barithon: In La∣tine Sabina and Sauina: It is a well kno∣wen shrubbe. There are two kindes of it, the one hath rough leaues like to the Cipres tree: the other like the leaues of the Tamariske; they are both of them planted in the gardens with vs, they are both attenuating and drying in the third degrée. Saunders, in Gréeke and Latine Santalum, Santalus, and of Actuarius Xylon Santalon, that is, Lignum Santalum. There are three kindes of it, that are all brought vnto vs from the Indies, to witte, yel∣low, white, and redde Saunders, all of them very common and well knowne at all Apothecaries. The yellow kinde is called Sandalum Flauum, and at the Apo∣thecaries Sandalum citrinum. The Ara∣bians call it Santalum Machoziri, Maza∣hari, and Machazari, that is, Santalum Aromaticum, or Santalum odoriferum, because it is the very best, and most fra∣grant of all the kinds. The red Saunders are called Santalum Rubrum, of others Rhodosantalum, that is, Santalum Rosa∣ceum, and at the Apothecaries Santalum Rubeum. The white Saunders are cal∣led Sandalum album. The best Saunders amongst all of them is the yellow kinde, next to that the white, and last of all the red. Whensoeuer one findeth Saunders in any receipt without addition, then is there the yellow Saunders alwayes vn∣derstood. There is also a false kinde of redde Saunders found at some Apothe∣caries, not vnlike to the true redde Saun∣ders, yet without any smell at all: this is a kinde of Brasill, but it hath a dar∣ker redde colour: The Druggists call it Sondalum Spurium; it may be called in English, bastarde Saunders, neyther ought it by any meanes to be vsed in Phi∣sicke. Scabious, of the Herbarists in Latine Sa∣biosa, and Herba Apostematica. There are fiue kindes of it, all of one vertue and operation. Psora Aetij is that com∣mon Scabious vsed at all Apotheca∣ries. Scammonie, in Gréeke and Latine Scamo∣nium, or Schamonia, Apopleumenon, Dacty∣lion, and Sanilum, of the Simplicists Ʋolu∣bilis Syriaca, Volubilis Antiochena, and Ʋo∣lubilis Colophonia: Dioscorides calleth it Co∣lophonium, and Sanilum: at the Apothe∣caries Schamonea, and of the Arabians Sachmunia. It is a plant that groweth in Syria neare Antiochia. It hath long sap∣pie stalkes, thrée square leaues, and white flowers like belles. It hath also a long sap∣pie roote as thick as ones armes, and white in colour. Dioscorides calleth this roote Radix Colophonia, and Radix Schambonia. The iuice which is prest out of this roote is also called as the plant Schamonia, or Scamonium. Some doe call this iuice in Gréeke onely Diacrydion, that is, Lacry∣mula, and at the Apothecaries Schamo∣nea. But our Phisitions now a dayes doe vnderstand by Diacrydion onely the pre∣pared Scammonie, which the common Apothecaries and Phisitions do call Dagri∣dium or Diagridium, and Schamonia prepa∣rata. Scorpion, Scorpius, Scorpio, a maruellous venemous little beast, in Italy and o∣ther countreyes very common. If it bite or sting a man, and that he vseth no pre∣sent remedie for it, he is constrained to die. Sea balles, in Gréeke Sphaera thalassia, of Galen in Latine Sphaera Marina, Pila marina, at the Apothecaries Balla marina, and Nico∣laus Myrepsus calleth it Palla marina: Dios∣corides doth name it Prunum Genus Aicionij. It is a kind of Sea sponge dried, and round like a ball, whence it hath the name pila ma∣rina. Sea Mussels, Concha marina, Conchilium mari∣num. Sea Wormewood, in Gréeke and Latine Absinthium thalassium, Absinthium mari∣num, Absinthium Seriphium, Helmintobata∣ne, Helmintopaea, Seriphon and Serifluum, at the Apothecaries Sementina, or Zina. The séede of it is onely vsed at the Apo∣thecaries to kill and expell the Wormes of the belly, they call it Semen Zina, Se∣men Lumbricorum, Semen Alexandrinum, and Semen Zedoariae. In Prouence that is in France, is another kind of sea wormewood, or wormeséede found, which is very like the garden Cypres, but it hath lesse store of séed than the former, and in the expulsion of wormes altogether as forcible. This plant is called Santonicum, Absinthium Santonicum, at the Apothecaries Sandonicum, Sanctoni∣cum, Absinthium Sanctonicum, Centonica, and
Herba centonica. By all these names doe they also vnderstand the Wormeseede, or sea Wormwood, for they do confound these and many others more. They do call the séede Semen Sandonicum, and Semen Sanctum, by which they do vnderstand both the for∣mer seedes. Selfeheale, Prunella, and Herba Diui An∣thonij. Sene leaues, are called in Greeke, Latine, and in the Arabian tongue Sena, and Senna. Mesues called them with a Persian name Abalzemer. There are two kinds of them, the lesser groweth in Syria and Aegypt, and are called (to distinguish them from the others) Sena Syriaca, Sena Aegyptiaca, and at the Apothecaries Sena Alexandrina, and Sena Orientalis. The greater Sene leaues doe grow in Italy and elsewhere, these are called of the Simplicsts Sena Ita∣lica, or Sena Prouincialis, and at the Apo∣thecaries Sena Florentina. They are much weaker in operation and vertues than the lesser kinde, and therefore more vnfit for physicall vses. Some there are that affirme Sena to be a kinde of Colutea. O∣thers would haue the Colutea Theophrasti to be Sena, or at the least a kinde of the same, but both of them do erre. Looke also in the Introduction of this booke for Sene leaues. Seruice trée, in gréeke Oa or Oe, in latin Sorbus: it is a wel knowne trée, whereof the fruit is called in latin Sorbum, and it is like to a litle peare. Sebestes, are little blacke berries, called in Greeke Myxa or Myxaria, of Actuarius in latine Sebestena, and at the Apotheca∣ries Sebesten. They are blacke berries, as bigge as hasell nuts, or little small dried prunes, they are well knowne at all Apo∣thecaries. Shéepe, Ouis. Shepheards purse, Bursa pastoris, and Pera pa∣storis. Silkewormes neastes, Folliculus Bombycis, they are called in latine Sericum crudum, or Sera cruda, at the Apothecaries Seta cruda. Siluer, in gréeke Argyros and Argyrion, and in latine Argentum. Siluermountaine, in Gréeke and latine Se∣seli, and of Plinie Seselis and Sili, of the Herbarists Seselium, at the Apothecaries Siselenos, and Seselios, indeclinabiliter. There are fiue kindes of it, the first, hath leaues like Fennell, but somewhat bigger, with a smooth stalke, the flowers are not vnlike to them of Dill, and after them followeth a little sharpe seede: the roote is long and odo∣riferous, and it groweth on stonie hilles. It is called in Gréeke Seseli Massilioticum, and Platycyminum, in Latine Seseli Massi∣liense. The Herbarists doe call it Seselium Massiliense: at the Apothecaries Siseleos, Si∣ler montanum, in English Siluermountaine, or Silermountaine. The second kinde is called Siluermountaine of Aethiopia, the stalke is of the thicknesse of a finger, wood∣die, and of a darke red colour. The leaues of it are very like to them of Honysuckles: they are smoothe, and pale greene in colour. It hath vpon it foure or fiue goodly yellow toppes like Fennell, but the seed is some∣what bigger than that of Fennell. It is called in Gréeke and Latine Cynophrycon, Se∣seli Aethiopicum, and of the Simplicists Se∣seli Aethiopicum Fruticans. The third kind is our common blacke Siluermountaine, which of many is taken for Seseli Aethiopi∣cum, because it hath the same vertues and operations. But the Herbarists do call it Seseli, or Seselium Aethiopicum Herbaceum, thereby to distinguish it from the aforena∣med. The fourth kind is our white Siluer∣mountaine, called in Gréeke and latine Se∣seli Peloponnesiacum, Seseli Peloponnese, and of the Herbarists Seselium Ceruinum Album. The fift kind is the Tordylium of Dioscorides. This herb as yet is not throughly knowne, because the description of it is so briefly set downe by the auncient writers, which do onely make mention of the seede of it. This is called in gréeke Tordylion, Tordylon, of Pli∣nie Syreon, of Paulus Aegineta Gorgylon, and in latine Seseli Creticum. But when and wheresoeuer thou findest Siluermoun∣taine or Siselios in any composition, then and there shalt thou alwayes vnderstand and vse the first kinde of Siluermoun∣taine. Sinober or Sinople, Vermillion, in Gréeke Cinnabaris, in Latine Cinnabrium. There are two kindes of it, the first is naturall, and digged out of the Mine: it is called in Greeke Miltos Ammion, in latine of Dioscorides and Plinie, Cinnabaris Fossilis, Minium Natiuum, in English Sinober of the Myne. The other kinde is made by the Alchimistes of Quickesiluer and
Brimstone, and it is called of the Sim∣plicists Cinnabaris Factitia, Cinnabrium Arti∣ficiale, and Minium Artificiale, with vs Ver∣milion. Siuet, in Gréeke of Actuarius Zapetion, in la∣tine of the Simplicists Zibethum, Zibettum, Alglia, and at the Apothecaries Zibeta: It is the fat or suet which is taken from the cods of the Siuet or muske Cat: at the first it smelleth very badly, but afterwards tur∣neth to so fragrant an odour that it farre surpasseth the Muske and Ambergreece: it is hote and moist by nature. It is vsed for the increase of humane séede, and for the in∣firmities of the Matrix. Sloe tree, or blacke Thorne, in Gréeke A∣griococcymelea, and Coccymelea agria. In Latine Punus syluestris, and of Virgill Spi∣nus. Smallage, in Gréeke and Latine Eleoselinum, Hydroselinum, Apium Palustre, and Palu∣dapium. Here is to be noted, that as often as any mention is made in this booke of Smallage séedes, leaues, iuice, or rootes, that the greater Pimpernell rootes are al∣wayes to be vnderstood for it, for that is the right Apium of the auncient Phisiti∣ons. Smaragde, in Latine and Gréeke Smaragdus, of Horatius, lapis viridis: it is a gréene precious stone. Snake, Serpens, Anguis. Snayle, Cochlea terrestris, a Snayle house and all.

Sophia, in Gréeke and Latine Thalietrum, and Thalictrum, of the Chirurgions and Herbarists Sophia, and Herba Sophiae. Some authors would haue this herbe to be Ab∣sinthium Seriphium, but they shall neuer approoue it to be true, for although they were the greatest Alchimists in the world, yet should they neuer transmute the one in∣to the other. This Sophia I will not de∣nie to be very good for the Wormes of the belly, yet doth it not thereby follow that it is Absinthium Seriphium, for if all the herbes should be of Sinchia Scriphia, that should expell wormes, then should we haue an infinite companie of them. Of this Ab∣sinthium Seriphium looke vnder the title of sea Wormewood. Sope, in Gréeke and Latine Smegma, or Sapo, of Martialis, Mattiaca Pila. Sope is prepared diuersly, but amongst all o∣thers is the blacke Sope best for Phi∣sicke. Sorrell, in Gréeke of Dioscorides Oxalis, A∣naxyris, and Lapathon, of Galen Oxylapa∣thum. Dioscorides doth otherwhiles call the Docke Oxylapathum, because it hath picked leaues: But Galen doth not call Sorrell by this name, because it hath picked leaues, but that it is amper and sower: for Oxylapathum is Lapathum A∣cidum, sower Docke: the Apothecaries do call it Acetosa. There are foure kindes of it: The first, is that which groweth euery where in gardens. The seconde kinde is as bigge againe as the common Sorrell, and groweth very plentifully in the Vineyardes neare Rhene: It is also planted in gardens for Sallads, and is called Oxalis satiua, or Acetosa satiua. The third kinde is set in the gardens in France, and high Burgundy, it hath round leaues, and is much sowrer than the common Sorrell, it might be called round Sor∣rell, of the Herbarists Oxalis Rotundafoi, Acetosa rotunda, Oxalis Francia, and Oxa∣lis Gallica. The fourth kinde of Sorrell groweth in the common fieldes, and drie places, it hath small narrow leaues, and may be called Shéepes or wilde Sorrell: of the Herbaristes Oxalis Tenuisolia, Ox∣alis minor, Oxalis Veruecina, and Oxalis Arueneis: at the Apothecaries Aceto∣sa mionr, and Acetosa ouina. But as of∣ten as you reade Sorrell in any composi∣tion, thou shalt alwayes vnderstand the common Sorrel, although the round be the best. Sower milke, in Greeke of Plinie Oxygala, in Latine Lac Acidum, or Lac Aceto∣sum.

Southernewood, Auroesne, or Wardrobe, in la∣tine Abrotonum, Thelyphtorium. The female kind of Southernwood is called garden Ci∣pers, Abrotonum foemina, it is called Chamae∣cyparissus, but vntruly; for Chamaecyparissus Plinij is not great and wooddy as the garden Cipers is, but it is a little herbe, about one span in height, otherwise it is very like to the garden Cypers, it is also called with vs the female Southernewood: the Herbarists do call it Abrotonum foemina, Cyparissus, and Cypressus hortulanus, and Sandolina. Sparrow, in Greeke Psar, Struthos, Colmis, and in latine Passer: a well knowne bird. Sparrowhauke, in Gréeke Spizias and Spizi∣tes, in Latine Accipiter, Fringellarius, and Nisus: it is a birde common and well knowne. Sperage, in Gréeke and Latine Asparagus or Aspharagus, at the Apothecaries Sparagus. There be two kindes of it, to wit, the wilde and the tame Sperage: the tame kind gro∣weth euery where neare the Rheine: the wild Sperage hath lesser leaues and séedes, this groweth on the hils, for which cause it is called Asparagus petraeus. Sperma Ceti, in Gréeke Halos anthos, in Latine Maris flos, of the Herbarists Sperma balnea∣rum, and at the Apothecaries Sperma Ceti: It is vsed for clotted bloud, being mixed with other things. Spider, in Gréeke Arachne, in Latine Aranea, Araneus: there is yet another kind, called of Plinie, Phalangium: this is big, and poisoneth in biting or stinging, it is only found in hot countries, and especially in Italy, where it is called Tarantula.

It is a very bigge kind of Spurge, it hath great long leaues, not vnlike to the Almond trée, red stalkes and branches, it is called Lathyris syluestris, and Cataputia syluestris. The second kind of Spurge hath thicke and picked leaues, like to the Mirtle; it is called in Gréeke and Latine Myrtites, Tithymalus myrsinites, Ti∣thymalus foemina, Caryites, Tithymalus Caryi∣tes, of Apuleius, Caryon, of Theophrastus and the Simplicists, Tithymalus myrtifolius, Ti∣thymalus myrtiphyllus, Tithymalus myrtaceus, of Apuleius, Multilago Capraria, of the com∣mon Herbarists Esula, or Esula myrtifolia, and Esula myrtacea. This kinde of Spurge groweth not with vs of it selfe, but is plan∣ted in gardens. The third kind of Spurge groweth about one spanne in height, and hath red branches, round leaues, white flo∣wers, and séedes as bigge as small peason, it is called sea spurge, in Gréeke and Latine Paralius, Tithymalus Paralius, Tithymalus ma∣ritimus, Tithymalus lactariolus, Tithymalis, and of Theophrastus, Coccos: of the Herbarists Lactariola, Herba Lactariola, and Esula, or Esula marina. The fourth kinde of Spurge groweth euery where in gardens, and néere hedges, it is an herbe not altogether a span in height, with red stalkes and branches, it hath round leaues like Purslaine, and it beareth a yellow flower, and turneth with the Sunne, in Gréeke and Latine Heliosco∣pius, Tithymalus helioscopius, Tithymalus Soli∣sequus, or Solisequius, Dentritis Apulcij (ob Arbusculae similitudinem) Cicer Columbinum,

Also if Esula or Spurge be na∣med in this booke, then is the Esula Cyparissia to be vsed. Squinanth, in latin and greeke Schoenus, Schoe∣nanthum, Iuncus odoratus, Pastus Camelorum, at the Apoth. Squinanthum: the flowers are called in greeke Schoenanthos, that is, Iunci flo∣res: they are now brought vnto vs againe, although they be not common euery where. Stag, Ceruus.

There are two kindes of it, the one commeth from Arabia, which hath leaues very like to La∣uender, but they are somewhat iagged, and to each stalke are thrée or foure compacted pares, and each one hath a little stalke, with prettie little purple flowers, of a very plea∣sant & fragrant smell, and it is now a dayes with vs planted in gardens: this kinde is called Stichas Arabica, and at the Apothe∣caries Stichados Arabicum. The other kinde groweth in Spaine, Italy, and in other places: it is not much vnlike the former, but that it is somewhat bigger, and the leaues are not iagged: the Herbarists do call this kind Stichados Europaea, it hath al∣so oftentimes a name of the place where it groweth, as that of France is called Stichas Gallica: the Italians do call their Stichados, Stichadem montanam: the Portingales doe call that which groweth in Arabia Rosma∣rinum Mauritanorum. The authors do com∣mend that of Arabia aboue all the other kindes, but because it is brought so farre, and that it loseth his vertue by the way, do the learned phisitions vse onely that which groweth in Europe. Stéele, in gréeke Calyps, and of Pollux, Stomoma, in latine Chalybs, of Pliny, Nucleus ferri, and Acies ferri. Stonecrop, Illecebra, Piper murinum, and of Di∣oscorides, Sedi tertium genus. Stone parsley, or parsley of Macedon, Petro∣selinum Macedonicum: they that haue great store of small skill in simples, haue hitherto vsed the parsley of Alexandria for that of Macedonia: Others, because they had no Stone parsley, haue vsed the greater pim∣pernell in steede of it; of which opinion Hieronimus Tragus (my maister) was the first, because that kinde of pimpernell is stronger, and agréeth better with the stone parsly than the other. But now hauing got∣ten the true Stone parsley, and planted it in diuers gardens, it is not néedfull to vse any other thing for it. The parsley of Alex∣andria hath also her proper vse in phisicke, and it is called of Dioscorides Smyrnium: of the Herbarists Petroselinum Alexandrinum, Petroselinum Cilicum, Apium Alexandrinum, Apium grande and Olusatrum: these herbes are seldome vsed alone.

There are sixe kinds of it: the first kinde is refined sugar, which artifici∣ally hath bene purified, and is called of the simplicistes Saccharum valentinum, Saccha∣rum finum, Saccharum refinatum, and Sac∣charum Tabazeth. The second kind is Ma∣dery sugar, which is brought from the Is∣land Madera, this is the second in goodnesse, and is called in latine Saccharum Maderien∣se or Mederiense. The third kind is Canary sugar, which is next in goodnesse to the Ma∣dery sugar, in latine Saccharum Canarium. The fourth kinde is the Malta or powder Sugar, it is brought from Maltha, and it is called of the simplicists Saccharum Maltanū. The fifth kind is a browne and soft Sugar, it is brought from the Island S. Thomas, and it is the very worst of all the kindes: it is called of the Simplicistes Saccharum Thomasinum, Saccharum Thomaeum, and at the Apothecaries Saccharum rubrum. The sixt kind is the sirup that floweth from the Sugar in refining, it is knowne euery where by the name of Sirupe, Mel Saccha∣rinum and Remel. Whensoeuer any mention is made of Sugar, then is either the Made∣ry sugar, or the Malta sugar to be taken and vsed. Sugar parsnep, in Gréeke and latine Sisarum and Siser: this is the true Sisarum or Siser of the auncient writers, and not our common parsnep, as some suppose; for the parsnep with the broade leafe is the true Elaphobos∣cum Dioscoridis. If we did alwayes distin∣guish our herbes after the best maner, we should not fall and run into so many confu∣sions and errors. Sulphure, looke for Brimstone in B. Suppositorie is vsed to procure stooles, and is called in Gréeke and latine Balanus, glans, and at the Apothecaries Suppositorium. Swallow, in gréeke Chelidon, in latin Hirundo. T. TAmariske, in gréeke Myrica, in latine Ta∣marix, of the herbarists Bryaria, and at the Apothecaries Tamariscus: it is a wel known trée, and groweth abundantly in many pla∣ces of Germany. Tansie, the Herbarists do ca it Tanacetum, and Athanasia. Tassell, in gréeke and latine Dipsacus, Onocar∣dium, Labrum Veneris, Carduus Veneris, Virga Pastoris, Carduus Fullonius, and Lauacrum Ve∣neris. Thrée leafed grasse, looke for Clauers in C. Thoroughwaxe, Pefoliata. Thunderbolt, Phrygius lapis of Dioscorides, and at the Apothecaries Lapis lyncis. The gen∣tle Reader is here to be admonished of the great abuse, harme and deceipt that hath hapned these many yeares at the Apotheca∣ries in the vse of this simple. For the vn∣skilful Phisitions, which do not much trou∣ble themselues with the true knowledge of simples, are as yet of opinion that the Thunderbolt should be engendred in the ayre; and they do vse it in their compositi∣ons to expell vrine, grauell and stone, and especially in the Lithontribon magnum Nicolai. But the stone which they call Lapis Lyncis or Lyncurium, is called of Galen and Diosco∣rides Lapis phrygius, for the Dyers in Phrygia doe vse it in their dyings. This fore∣sayd stone (as Dioscorides witnesseth) grow∣eth in Cappadocia; but neither Galen nor yet Dioscorides doth say, that this stone should be engendred in the ayre, for it is a thing that groweth of it selfe, as the Calamine doth, and (as Galen sayth) it hath the same vertues with the Flint, but that this may not be vsed inwardly. By this may appeare how greatly they haue erred that haue cal∣led this stone Lapis Lyncis or Lyncurium: also how diuersly men haue bene deceaued, and their infirmities encreased, in ministring vnto them diuers compositions, wherein this stone is put. Wherefore euery care∣full Phisition ought diligently to reade the books of Dioscorides, Galen, Pliny, Aetius, and of Nicolaus Myrepsus, that he might thereby perceiue his owne defaults, and turne back from his errors. Dioscorides in his second booke de re Medica, and the 74. chapt. wri∣teth after this maner of the Thunderbolt: It hath bene thought that the water of the ayre, which is called Lyncurium, should con∣geale into a stone, but it hath bene found false, and all whatsoeuer else hath bene sayd of it; for the Lyncurium is that which is cal∣led of some Electrum Pterigophoron, Amber,
or white Amber, and is brought vnto vs in great abundance from Prussia; these are the very words of Dioscorides. The like false opinion doth Plinie detect lib. 37. cap. 3. Here may you euidently perceiue, that nei∣ther auncient writers haue held any thing of that false and fained opinion; for they do all affirme that Electrum, Succinum, and Lyn∣curt is one and the same thing, which hath bene sufficiently seene by the words of Dioscorides. It doth also appeare in the wri∣tings of Aetius, and Nicolaus Myrepsus, that they meant nothing else by their Thunder∣bolt Lyncurium or Lapis lyncis, but onely Suc∣cinum that is the Amber. Also that the Am∣ber commeth not out of the aire, but out of the sea, that is sufficiently knowne to all the world. But whether that vnskilful crue had sayd that it were engendred of a cer∣taine water in the aire, or that it is the vrin of a beast congealed into a stone, that were a small error, if they had vsed the right Am∣ber in their compositions. That Amber hath power to expell the stone, vrine, and grauell, (which vertues are ascribed to the Lyncurium) that is sufficiently knowne to euery expert Phisition: and that the white Amber is the right Lyncurius or Lyncurium, that may be shewed by the words of Aetius, who calleth it Electrum, Lyncurium, and Suc∣cinum, and distinguisheth the yellow Am∣ber from it, calling it Chryselectrum, that is, Aureum Electrum. And Dioscorides in the former chapter calleth the white Amber E∣lecum Pterigophoron, and in the first book de medica materia, doth he call the yellow Am∣ber Chrysophorum. Hereby do we conclude that Lapis Lyncis, Lyncurius or Lyncurium (as the Grecians terme it) is nought else but the white Amber: wherefore héede must be taken that thou vse the white Amber in all compositions that haue the Lapis lyncis in them. Of the vertues of the Thunderbolt, looke for Amber. Thyme, in géeke and latine Thymum, Thymus, Serpilium Romanum, or herba Thymiana, at the Apothecaries Tymus. There are two kinds of it, and both of them are set in gar∣dens, but in hote countries do they grow euery where of themselues. The first kind is white, and hath long eares or heads like to Stechados, it hath a very pleasant smell, it is called in Gréeke and Latine Thymum capitatum, Thymum candidum, Thymum cre∣ticum, Thymum Spicatum, and Thymum aro∣maticum: we call it white Thyme. The se∣cond kind is rougher, and of a darke gréene colour, and it is common in all gardens, and well knowne by the name of Thyme. The first kind is much better for phisicke than the other if it may be gotten: they are both of them hot and dry in the third degrée. Tillet trée, in greek Philyra, in latin Tilia: there are two kinds of it, the common Tillet trée, and the wild Tillet trée, which groweth in the shadowy wood and hilles, it is very like to the tame kind, but that it is much lesse; it bloweth also slower, and at the last the blossomes fall off without any fruite. It is called the wild Tillet trée, or stone Til∣let, because the wood of it is harder and more compacted than the tame: it is called in Latine Tilia syluestris and Tiliamas. The blossomes and the fruites of it are vsed in phisicke. Toade, in gréeke Phrynus, of Virgill, Bufo, and of Plinie, Rubeta. Some vnskilfull Phisiti∣ons do take Rubeta to be the leafe-frogge, which is a great error, for they are as like as an apple is like to an oyster, because the Toade is hurtfull and venemous, and the Leafe-frog without all hurt or harme. Tormentil, is called of Dioscorides, Chrysogonon, and of others Heptaphyllon, of the Herbarists Septifolium, Betularia, & at the Apothecaries Tormentilla.

Turbith, of Actuarius, Turpetum, in Latine of the Herbarists Turbetum, of the Arabians Turbith and Turbeth. There are foure kinds of it: the first is the white Turbith, very common at al Apothecaries, this kind is called of Dioscorides in Gréeke Alpum, of Actuarius Alypias, and Turpetum album, at the Apothecaries Turpetum Orientale, or Turpetum Alexandrinum, and in English white Turbith. The second kind is called
of Dioscorides and Actuarius, Pityusa, Clema, Crabion, and Canopicon, of the Herbarists Turpetum nigrum, and Esula maior: also of the Arabians Alscebram maius, or Scebram maius, in english blacke Turbith. The third kind is called in gréeke Thapsia, Hypopiū, and Pancranum, in latine Ferulago, and Ferula syluestris, of the Herbarists Turpetum cineri∣tium, and Turpetum Mesuis, and Mesues hath vnderstood by his Turbith nothing els but Thapsia. The fourth kind is the Turpe∣tum Serapionis, who also hath his seuerall Turbith. Dioscorides calleth it Tripolium, Psyche, Meris, Stachyites, of the Herbarists Turpetum Serapionis, and Aster marinus: but when thou findest Turbith in any compo∣sition with any addition, then is the white Turbith to be vnderstood for it. Turmericke, Cyperus Indicus, the Apotheca∣ries call it Curcuma, and Terra merita, Ra∣sis calleth it Vena citrina. Turneps, looke for Rapes in R. Turpentine is called Resina Terebinthi, Tere∣binthina, or Terminthina, of the Arabians and Apothecaries Terbentina, Terpentina, & Termentina. It is not the cōmon Turpen∣tine that floweth from the Fir trée, as the vnskilfull suppose, but it is the true Tur∣pentine of the Turpentine trée.

Tuttie, at the Apothecaries Tutia factitia, Cad∣mia botryitis, or Cadmia Acinosa, and Cad∣mia officinarum. V. VAlerian, in gréeke and latine Phu, Vale∣riana, Genicularis, Herba benedicta and Marinella. There are foure kindes of it, and two of them only in vse; the first is the common Valerian, which onely ought to haue that name. The second kind is plan∣ted in gardens, although it be otherwhiles found in woods and on hils: it hath much greater leaues than the common Valerian, and also a bigger roote, of the thicknes of a finger, & this is the true Phu of the auncient writers. It is called Phu Ponticū, in english great Valerian, the Herbarists do call it Theriacaria, Herba diui Georgij, Georgiana, & Herba diuae Mariae. This is commended be∣fore the former Valerian, if it may be got∣ten. They are hot in the first, and dry in the second degrée. Venus haire, in gréek Trichoman, Callitrichon, Eupteron, of Hippocrates, Calliphyllon, of Apu∣leius, Tricophys, Selinophyllon, Dyphyes, Scholi∣brochon, Amianthon, and Adianton: although Dioscorides do describe another kind of Adi∣anton, to wit, Maydenhaire, yet notwith∣standing is Venus haire the true Adiantum Apuleij: in latine Herba Capillaris, Barba Herculis, and Pinnula, of Apuleius, Herba cri∣nita, Capillus Veneris: the Apothecaries call it Polytrichum. There are yet two kindes more of it, to wit, the greater and the lesser Maidenhaire: the greater kind is called of the Herbarists Polytrichum aureum, Adiantū aureum, & Capillaris aurea. The lesser is cal∣led Adiantum aureum minus. Some haue ta∣ken both these kinds for Polytrichon Apuleij; but they erre greatly, as doth appeare by the description of it. But when thou readest Venus haire in any composition, then shalt thou take the common Venus haire.

The second kind of Wolfsbane hath leaues like to the Italian plaine tree, but some∣what déeper iagged: the roote is blacke, with many haires about it. This plant is sufficiently knowne by the name Wolfs∣bane, it groweth on high hils, and is cal∣led in Greeke and Latine Lycoctonum, Aco∣nitum Lycoctonum, Cynoctonum, and aconitum Cynoctonum.

The sixt kinde groweth in darke and shadowie woods, the stalke is about one span and a halfe in height, and about the middest of the same are foure darke gréene leaues, stan∣ding opposite one against the other: it get∣teth a blacke berry, vnder which, many little leaues are placed each opposite to o∣ther. It is called of the Herbarists Aconi∣tum salutiferum, Sigillum Christi, Crux Chri∣sti, Sigillum Veneris, and Herba Paris. It is a very holsome herbe, and may be vsed in∣wardly very well against many diseases. Many learned men would haue it to be Aconitum pardalianches, but it is as like it as an apple is like an oyster. By Wolfs∣bane shalt thou vnderstand the yellows Wolfsbane. Wormewood, in Latine and Gréeke Absin∣thium, Aloina: there are thrée kindes of it: The first, is the common Wormewood that groweth euery where, called Bathypi∣con, Barypicon, and Absinthium rusticum.

This kinde will neuer be greater although it grow in fertill grounds. This is the same Wormewood which Dioscorides doth call Absinthium ponticum, Mesues Absinthium Romanum, of the Simplicists Absinthium montanum, and Plinie, Absinthium Italicum. The third kinde is very like the great Wormewood, but it hath lesser leaues and stalks then the mountaine Wormewood, it groweth also somewhat higher: The leaues are white and soft. This groweth on sandie ditches. It is called Romish Wormewood, to auoyd all errours, and we leaue the name of mountaine Worme∣wood vnto the second kin▪ This Worme∣wood is called of Galen Absinthium ponticum. But Mesues and other authors do take the second kinde to be the true Absinthium pon∣ticum. Whensoeuer thou findest Worme∣wood by it selfe in any composition, then is the mountaine wormewood to be taken and vsed; and if that cannot be had, then must you take the common wormewood that groweth in the fields, and not that which groweth in gardens; for the garden wormewood is not so strong, neither can it performe that which the wilde worme∣wood doth that groweth on dry grounds. Wormewood is hot in the first, and dry in the third degrée. Yerrow, Nosebléede, or Millfoyle, in Gréeke Stratiotes, Chiliophyllos, Supercilium veneris, Herba militaris, and Millefolium. It is a common herb, it is drying and astringent. Yewe, Taxus, Smilax, Milos. The end of the second Table.
