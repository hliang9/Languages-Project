THE PREFACE. AS there is nothing that has been hitherto writ∣ten, tho' never so perfect, (not even the Sa∣cred Scriptures themselves excepted) nor yet in any Age of the World or Period of Time, but hath been liable to the Cavils of some, and Scorn of others; no Man can suppose me so far bigotted to my own Perfor∣mance, and much less my self, as once to think of a Possibility of escaping the common Calamity of Authors in this Kind; Especially when I consider, that the very Nature of the Vndertaking is such, as not to exempt it from the Censures of the meanest Capacity, who will take upon him to judge of the Transactions of his own Time in as Despotick a Manner, as if himself had been actually concerned in them, and privy to the most Secret as well as minutest Passages thereof. How much more unlike then is it, that I should pretend to surmount the Repre∣hensions of those, who would be thought to be more criti∣cally vers'd in Historical Tracts; And who will say, the Revolutions of the succeeding Age will be little enough to make a Compleat Discovery of the Truths of the pre∣ceding One; And that Time alone can give every Thing its true Light, which the Authority of Superiors, and prevalent Partiality of Writers, must at present involve in too great an Obscurity to be trusted to; And that tho' the daring Presumption of a few may have been thought to reach so far as to make a Reparation of this Deficiency, yet that has been observed to have been usually no other than a glaring Light, and such as has been borrowed, either from a prejudiced Fancy, or interested Self.
But how plausible soever these Objections may be, I must assume the Liberty to say, That besides the Authori∣ty of some of the most Celebrated Historians that have ever writ to justifie my present Practise, I cannot see any such Inconveniency to arise, (as would be suggested) from writing the History of the Age to the Age it self: For tho' it should be allowed, that some Things should neces∣sarily lie dormant as to us, and be reserved to the Dis∣covery of future Generations, yet surely there are many others that must be unavoidably lost, if protracted to such an uncertain Period, where not only a true Idea of Things, and many Notions relating to the Humour of our Age upon emergent Turns and Occasions, will be quite extinct: But many Accidents and Circumstances (as a late learned Author has noted) which are no part of the Records of Time, and which soon die and are forgotten, are so interwoven in History, as to make it entire, and of one piece, aud which not only enlivens it, and creates Pleasure in the reading of it, but without them History it self becomes disjonted, and is made up of broken Pieces. But though what has been now offered might be allowed for a Satisfactory Answer in relation to a full Compen∣sation for future Discoveries, there are yet a sort of Gentlemen of a nicer Palate, who rather than the Work should pass untraduced, will quarrel at the Method of it, and utterly disclaim any thing that appears by the way of Annals, as being necessarily broken Matter, and and ill-concerted together, that creates no manner of Pleasure in the reading of it; but on the contrary, makes the Matter it self to be nauseated, because of the Manner of it. Now, I confess, it will be a hard Task to give a plenary Satisfaction herein, especially where there is not only so much Colour of Reason, but some real Truth in what is suggested thereby. But certainly, if Things were duely weighed in all their Circumstances, there would be, per∣haps, much less Error found in the Method it self, than the Management of it: For the Want of a good Connection
and suitable Disposition of Things, will make that look monstrous and distorted, that otherwise might prove beautiful and charming enough. And as I have endea∣voured, with a studied Sedulity, to avoid this great In∣conveniency, so if the Success should prove answerable thereto, it will first remove the Objection, and conse∣quently satisfie the Readers Scruples and Curiosity. But on the other hand, were it taken for granted, that all Annals, after all, cannot be so well concerted, as other Methods of Writing are, where the Liberty of Joining, Dividing, Contracting, and Enlarging, is nothing near so stinted as in the present Case: Yet it must not be deny∣ed, but an exact beating of Time, which is so peculiar and essential a Part of our Method, and with which no other can pretend to vie to this Particular, does undoubt∣edly over-compensate the other Deficiencies it may be liable to. And to say, It has been both an ancient and modern Practice, should not (in my poor Opinion) lessen, but rather encrease an Esteem of it. It remains now we should give a succinct Account of the Treatise it self; and so much the rather, because tho' all the preceding Suggestions to the Prejudice of it were totally removed, yet I cannot but foresee, that there is Space enough left still for Cavilling and finding Faults, which every Man would obviate according to the just Rules that are allowed him, as well as in the best Manner he could. I hope it will not be expected I should make a Enu∣meration, in this place, of every particular Author I have made use of towards the Compiling of this Book: This (I am sure) would be to swell a Preface beyond all just, and even tolerable Bounds, and render the same as contemptible, as some of those Authors I have made an Inspection to; because I would see every Thing that could be thought to make for my Purpose, tho' no other∣wise used by me than to discover Falshood from Solid Truth: And yet to be altogether silent upon this Head would appear too Dictator-like; as if ipse dixit, and
no farther, were enough to stop all Mens Mouths, and make them acquiesce with it. Our History then com∣mences from the Time of the first setting on foot the Trea∣ty of Nimeguen, whereof Sir W. T. has given so ex∣cellent an Account, as to the Rise, Progess, and Con∣tinuation of it, as has proved to the Satisfaction, gene∣rally, of all Men, (the French excepted) who have wrote a Treatise also upon the same Subject, Dedicated to Monsieur Colbert, one of the Active Plenipotentiaries of France on that Occasion; And which, tho' it carries all those Affectations which are so peculiar to that Nation throughout the whole Body of it; yet, I must own, it has given Light to some other Things, that otherwise might have remained in the Dark to this Day: From these two I have made up, (saving what refers to some particular Articles and intervening Passages relating to the War, wherein They are generally very concise) that Treaty entire; which brought me of Course into an En∣quiry into the Popish Conspiracy, and what succeeded there∣upon at Home, more particularly in relation to the Hu∣mour, as well as Demeanour of our then Court, where I have not had Leisure to dwell over-long, when the Con∣traventions, and, I may say, Infractions of the said Treaty, called me Abroad, from whence I have passed into Hun∣gary, and after having given an Account of something preludious to the War there, which will, I belive, re∣main still a Paradox, I have, in the respective Years of it, traced the same, as well as those managed by Po∣land and Venice, the Emperor's Confederates therein, against the Infidels, throughout the whole Variety there∣of to the final Period of it. And herein, I confess my self to have received great Assistances from divers Tracts written concerning particular Sieges, and other memo∣rable Actions, as they occurred. And as I have endea∣voured to oblige the Reader with as many Original Pa∣pers as I could in relation to this War, so it will be found I have not declined the same Practise in respect to other Occurrences; and, more especially, have been very so∣licitous
to omit nothing of that kind that was worthy to be perpetuated in Reference to our own Affairs; to that grand Revolution that happened amongst us; the secret Machinations used to unhinge our Settlements; and the tedious and bloody War we have been since engaged in, which I have made my Business to give as true a Light into, as was consistent with the various and diversified Relations, that by the contending Parties have been given of it: And if I should intimate in this Place, that I have made it part of my Business to keep a Journal of the Trans∣actions of these Times; and add thereto, That I have had the Assistance of the best Authors in most Languages; and that, in consequence hereof, not few Things have been rectified or supplied from my own particular Observations and Discoveries, I should do my self no Wrong, though I might incur the Censures of others for it. But, after all, I am so far from pretending to have committed no Error herein, that all I will say, is, I am not guilty of any wilful Mistake. But as this Treatise would have been very lame and imperfect, if, amidst the Sound of War, I had not observed the Overtures made from time to time of a Peace; So I should have been much more inexcusable, if I should not have been very particular concerning the last general Negotiation, in all the Paces made till the final Conclusion of it; and of which, I am morally assu∣red, there is a much better Account given, than is yet to be found any other where, now extant amongst us. But, as it will be needless to insist upon the Vsefulness of the Introductory Discourse I have given, to show the State of the World, in respect to the Enlargement of Do∣minion and Conquest, down to the Commencement of our History; to say any thing for the Necessity of a Table to the whole Work, will be much more so: Wherefore, to conclude, As our History ends with the General Peace we now enjoy, let our Value and Esteem of him, who, under God, has been the particular Instrument of it, our dread Sovereign King William, be enhaunsed more and more, who has so many Personal Excellencies, both in Peace and
War, as to have no manner of Need to borrow any from the Vertues of his Ancestors, whereof there has been such an unparallell'd Chain, as is not to be met with in Hi∣story; And the Antiquity of whose Name, for ought I can see, may be as old as Julius Caesar, who in the First Book of his Commentaries, says, A Body of Ger∣mans, out of Suabia, came, under the Command of Two Brothers, Nasua and Cimberius by Name, and settled upon the Banks of the Rhine, near Treves. Now this is so much the more worthy of Observation, that besides the Similitude of the Names of Nasua and Nasau, which only differ in the Transposition but of one Let∣ter, there is an Estate upon that Spot of Ground, which belongs to the Family to this Day: But be it as it will, I was the more desirous to take Notice of it upon this Oc∣casion, because I believe it is the first time it has been done by any other in this kind: And because it may stir up the Curiosity of those Gentlemen that are skilled in Genealo∣gies, to make a farther Enquiry into it. As for this Second Edition, whereunto the Transacti∣ons of another Year are added, which more particularly include the Negotiations of a Truce with the Turks, and so leaves all Europe in Peace, I have nothing to say, but that what Mistakes or Deficiences, thro' Haste or Inadvertency the former may have laboured under, I have now endeavoured to rectifie and supply them, with all becoming Diligence and Sincerity.
INTRODUCTION. THERE has been almost as much Contest between the Learned, about what Form of Government is best, and was of Primitive Institution, as there has been Endeavours used by the Princes and States of the World, to propagate their Dominion and Power, to the Diminution of that of their Neighbours. This Itch of Superiority and Rule has in all Ages, from the Beginning, been the Property of all sorts of Governments. And though it has been a general Assertion, and and pretty common Observation of Latter Times, that Republicks, whe∣ther Aristocratical, Democratical, or otherwise constituted, have not been so proper for Extending of Conquest, as Monarchical Constitutions; yet, that it has not been always so, is manifest from the Commonwealths of Rome and Carthage, who enlarged the Bounds of their Dominions to a greater Degree than any other Kingdom or State whatever, that we know of, save somewhat more that was done by the Introduction of a single Ad∣ministration into the former Republick; which yet did not prove of any long Duration, or fixed Settlement: For, tho' no Empire upon Earth could ever pretend to vye with that of Rome in this Particular, and which therefore, for that Reason, we may call An. Vniversal Monarchy; yet, being at length tired out, and crasie with Age, she sunk under her own Weight, being over∣run, and divided into divers Pieces, by those Nations she ever termed Bar∣barous; but proved neither so contemptible in their Arms, nor o unskilful in Government, as the Name they gave them did import. 'Tis, indeed, not to be doubted, but that the Division made of the Em∣pire, by Theodosius, between his Two Sons, Arcadius and Honorius, into the Eastern and Western, did very much precipitate the Ruine of it: For, tho' the former, for many Ages after, made a Shift to keep up, yet it came in∣finitely short of the Ancient Roman Empire, for Power and Splendour; and was so harassed, by degrees, with the Insults of the Neighbouring Nati∣ons, and diminished by the Conquests of the Bulgarians over one part of it; by the Saracens subduing Palestine, Syria, Egypt and Cilicia; by the City of Trebesond, and the Neighbouring Countries, withdrawing themselves from under the Obedience of it, and chusing an Emperor of their own; as Greece set up divers petty Princes, to govern the different Parts of it; That the poor Remains thereof was not only swallowed up at length by the Turks, but most of the said conquer'd or revolted Divisions, to other very great Acquisitions of their own, made both before and after, fell under their Do∣minion also; which made them, for a Time, more formidable in Power, than any other single Dominion, known to us, in those Parts of the World. But the Fate of the West. Part of that divided Empire came on a pace, the same be∣coming a Prey to the Germans and Goths, who, about this time, came in pro∣digious Numbers, to change their poor Habitations, for the pleasant and fertile Provinces of the Romans: Britain became a Prey to the Saxons: Spain fell to the Share of the West-Goths: The Goths, Burgundians and Franks
made bold with dividing France between them: Rhoetia and Noricum were conquered by the Suevians: A great part of Pannonia and Illiricum fell in∣to the Hands of the Huns: The Vandals fixed their Habitations in Africa: And one part of the Goths set up a Kingdom in Italy, and did not think Rome, once Mistress of the World, and the common Mother and Habita∣tion of Mankind, a fitting Place for their Kings to reside in. The Empire being thus mangled, and rent into so many different Pieces, the next Thing (according to the Course of a corrupted and vain World) these Invaders went upon, (after some tolerable Settlement in their re∣spective Acquisitions;) was, to incroach upon their Neighbours, and to endeavour to introduce such a Dominion again upon the Earth, as might (in Imitation of that glorious Empire, which all of them, in their several Turns, had given an Helping-hand to overthrow) over-top all others, and merit the Name of a Supream and Universal One: But there have hi∣therto, in the Course of Divine Providence, such Rubs been laid in the Way of this Design, that it could never be accomplish'd, tho' divers Princes have attempted it with the greatest Application, and some seem∣ing Probability of Success. As Islands are not so liable to be invaded, as those Kingdoms and States that lie upon the Continent; So neither are they, on the other hand, so proper to make Conquests of others, and to enlarge their Territories. And if Great Britain has come, in any respect, short of other Countries in this Particular, this is a sufficient Reason for it. But there were other Causes and Considerations, which we shall a little consider, before we go any farther. Tho' tho Saxons made an entire Conquest of the best and fruitfullest Part of Britain; yet neither the most Northern Parts of the Island, pos∣sessed by the Picts and Scots; nor the Southern, known since by the Name of Cornwall; much less the ancient Habitation of the Britains, wrongfully called Wales, could they subdue in a long time, nor the first, indeed, at all entirely. Add to this, That the Saxons themselves had no less than Seven Dynasties, or petty Kingdoms, amongst them, known all together by the Heptarchy; which took them up, from their first Landing under Hengist, by Alliances, and the Power of their Arms, not much less than 400 Years, to unite them into one Monarchy, which happen'd under K. Egbert, about the Year 800. But tho' this Conjunction of Seven into One was very considerable, and that now some grand Efforts might have been made for reducing the remaining Parts of the Island under one Head; the Danes, now a very Potent and Sea-faring People, in the very same King's Reign, invaded Britain; Between whom, and the English, there were continual Wars, for the Space of 240 Years; and the former so far prevail∣ed, that Three of their Kings reigned successively over England, for 26 Years, when the Government returned again into the Hands of the Eng∣lish: But it was so weak and feeble, that in a short time it fell into the Hands of Will. surnamed the Conqueror, and his Normans; in whose Son's Reign, (Henry I. by Name,) the Dukedom of Normandy was annexed to the Crown of England. This so considerable Accession of Strength upon the Continent came yet short of a Compensation for the still remaining Dis∣junction of Scotland and Wales from the rest of Britain, which the succeed∣ing
Kings little minded to effect: For, tho' Henry II. was the greatest King at this time in our Western World, as being, besides K. of England and Duke of Normandy, by Inheritance Duke of Anjou, and by Marriage Duke of Aquitain and Poictou; yet he was so far from going through stitch with his intended Conquest of Wales, or reducing Scotland, that his chief Aim was upon the Conquest of Ireland; which, tho' a noble Design, and in a very great Measure effected, yet it was misplaced, and should have fol∣lowed the Reduction of the other two. Yet what came to Henry upon the Continent, by Right of Inheritance, his Son King John, and his Grand∣son Henry III. in a manner, totally lost. But of all the Kings of England, to this Time, Edward I. was the only Prince that seemed to have a right Notion of Extending his Dominions; and therefore he never gave over, till what by fair and foul Means, with an Intermixture of Policy, he entire∣ly united Wales to the Kingdom of England; and made, in a manner by the same Methods, a perfect Conquest of Scotland; which nothing (hu∣manely speaking) but the Weakness of his Successor, obstructed the Con∣summation of. So that henceforward all the Thoughts of our Warlike Kings, were, the Recovery of that Right they alledged to have to the Kingdom of France; whose Conquests there, if they had been as wisely secured, as they were valiantly made, had added a much greater Glory to the English Name, than our Annals would otherwise admit of. But that which our Kings would not, or could not, add to their Dominions by Con∣quest, within the Island it self, I mean the Scotch Kingdom, which always obstructed the Progress of their Arms upon the Continent, at length fell in of it self in the Course of Succession: So that England, Scotland and Ire∣land were, in the Person of King James I. united under one Head. In the mean time one of our Neighbour-Nations was arrived to that Pitch of Greatness, and another of them in so growing a Posture, that such a Tripple Conjunction seemed only seasonable upon this Account, in that the same tended to our Safety. But by what Methods these our Neighbouring-Nations have attained to that Greatness, it will be necessary to enquire into: And, first, we shall begin with Spain, which, upon the Declension of the Roman Empire, fell into the Share of the West-Goths, and other barbarous Nations, who for a Time laboured under the same Inconveniencies of a divided Dominion, as the Saxons did in Britain: But towards the Year 586, their Empire was arrived to the highest Pitch of Greatness, as comprehending not only the Neighbouring-Provinces of France, and part of Mauritania in Africa, but also all Spain, except a small Part, possessed yet by the Romans, who held not that long neither. From thence the Gothick Empire declined apace, and all fell into the Hands of the Saracens. But their Affairs began to re∣vive again about the Year 726; and one Pelagius, who was said to have been descended from the Race of the Gothick Kings, prevailed mightily both against the Moors and Saracens, as divers of his Successors did also. However, these turmoiled Times gave Original to several Kingdoms within the Boundaries of Spain; For besides the Kingdom of Oviedo, or Leon, which were all one in Effect, there arose also others; as those of Navarre, Arragon and Castile. But all these Kingdoms, which also professed
Christianity, were united in the Person of Sanctus Major II. whereby an Opportunity was given the Christians to root out the Moors, now divided amongst themselves, and to restore Spain to its ancient State: yet Sanctus, tho' otherwise a brave Prince, had no more Wit than to divide them a∣mongst his Sons, and gave each of them the Title of King. These not be∣ing able to confine themselves to their respective Proportions, made War upon one another, with various Success; as it gave the Moors also some Advantage in their Proceedings, till, in a manner, all was united again, under Alphonso VIII. who play'd the same Trick, of dividing Castile, Leon and Gallicia between his 3 Sons; so that they and their Successors had so much to do with the Moors within Spain, and such mutual Jealousies of one another, that they could be able to do little any where else under the No∣tion of Conquest. Things were at length brought to such a pass, that Spain (to say nothing of Portugal, and the Kingdom of the Moors in Granada) was reduced into Two Kingdoms only, to wit, Arragon and Castile; and these again were united by the Marriage of Ferdinand, the Son of John II. King of Arragon, whom his Father had declared King of Sicily, to Isabella, Sister to Henry IV. King of Castile. By this Conjunction Spain became mighty Powerful; And Ferdinand, after he had set his Affairs in Order, began now to entertain great Thoughts: And well knowing it would be in vain to undertake any Thing Abroad, while he had a powerful Enemy with∣in the Body of Spain it self at his Door; he undertook an Expedition against the Moors of Granada, which cost him so much Time and Expence to con∣quer, being no less than 10 Years engaged in the Work, that he could, per∣haps, have sat down contented herewith, at least for a time, had not some∣thing else fallen in his way. But Ferdinand by aiming to make sure of his Conquest, deprived his Country in some succeeding time of the Benefit of it; for he thereupon banished no less than 170000 Families of Jews and Moors out of Spain, and thereby dispoiled his Country, not only of vast Riches, but a great Number of Inhabitants, wherein consists the Power and Support of a Nation. But whatever Designs Ferdinand might, after a little breathing Time, have concerted to have undertaken Abroad, now he was freed from the Evil that had hitherto diverted him from any Foreign Expedition, the French who now found themselves under the same Circumstances, as being rid of the English that had stuck so long and so close upon the Skirts of them, as not to be able to move elsewhere, thought to be before-hand with Ferdinand in the Reduction of the Kingdom of Naples; which the other, notwithstanding they gave him up Rousillion in order at least to let them proceed unmolested, being not able to brook, it came to an open Rupture; And after divers Conflicts, Ferdinand carried the Day, and with it the King∣dom of Naples, to which, if we add the Discovery of America, and the rich Mines there about this time, and the Kingdom of Navarre which Ferdinand possest himself of upon the Pope's Excommunicating John d' Albret, King of that Country, at the other's Instigation; we shall find this Monarchy grown to a prodigious Grandeur. In this State, Ferdinand left it to his Grandson Charles, who being as well elected Emperor of Germany, as he was Hereditary King of Spain, and withal a very active Prince; Tho' he
did very great Things, whilst he held the Rains of Government; yet it may still seem a Wonder he had not done much more. This was, indeed, an Age fruitful for several brave Princes, and here I cannot but admire the Wisdom of God, that this Charles V. who was so vastly Potent, should have for his Cotemporaries a Harry VIII. in England, a Francis I. in France, and a Solyman the Magnificent in Turky, who were all Men of great Souls, as well as Power, and especially the last of them, not inferior to Charles upon any account. However, such was the Conjuncture, that Charles to his vast Dominions added still more, by routing Francis and taking him Prisoner, and thereby bringing him to make a Surrender of the Dutchy of Burgundy, to renounce the Sovereignty over Artois and Flanders, and to quit all his Pretences upon Naples and Milan, which last the French had for some time been in Possession of: But Francis having got his Liberty, disclaimed the Agreement, and this occasioned a new War, which ended in Francis his be∣ing forced to confirm the Main of the said Treaty, and left Charles at Liber∣ty, to add to the Conquests his Grand-father Ferdinand had made in Africa, of Bugia and Tripolis, that of Tunis and Goletta, to which if we add the So∣vereignty of Vtrecht, of the Provinces of Over Issel, Geldren, Zutphen, Gronin∣ghen, &c. consigned about this Time into his Hands, it must still be allowed a mighty Accession of Strength to that vast Empire. Wherefore, to com∣pleat, as he thought, his great Work of attaining to an Universal Monarchy in these Western Parts, he cunningly lays aside the Contest about the Di∣vorce between Henry VIII. King of England, and his Aunt Katharine, and entred into a League with the said King, of invading France, the Empe∣ror by the Way of Champaigne, and the King thro' Picardy, to compleat the Conquest of that Noble Country: In order to which, the Emperor ad∣vanced as far as Espernay, which occasioned such a Terror and Confusion in Paris, that the Citizens were for leaving the City; if the King by his Pre∣sence, had not incouraged them to stay: Tho' the Emperor, as believing himself much stronger, thought to delude Henry of his projected Propor∣tion, the other grew too cunning for him, for being in expectation that Henry would have advanced, and so both of them hem in the French Army on each side, he sent him Word, He would not stir from Bologn and Mon∣streville, till he had made himself Master of them, which made Charles recoyl and clap up a Peace; then he turned all his Thoughts upon the Re∣duction of the Protestants, and with them the Liberty of Germany; where∣in, tho' he went a great length, yet he was at last so baffled by Maurice, E∣lector of Saxony, at Inspruck, that he was glad to make a Peace with them also: So that now being diffident of ever attaining his Ends, and wearied with the Toils of Empire, and the Infirmity of his Body, he resigned up the Empire to his Brother Ferdinando, who having been before chosen King of the Romans, would not consent it should come to his Son Philip: This Philip had at the same time all his Father's Hereditary Dominions put into his Hands, and being a Prince as Politick as Powerful, and withal Married to Mary, Queen of England, had it not been for his Father's Error, in dividing the Power of the Austrian Family, by separating the Imperial Crown from the Spanish Monarchy; I cannot see, if we speak after the Manner of Men, what could have hindred this Philip II. from attaining to the Dominion of Europe, in a short time: But besides this, other Accidents quickly inter∣vened,
and as Politick as this Prince seemed to be, those very Methods he took to attain still to his desired Ends of Supream Sovereignty, by intro∣ducing the Inquisition, and an Arbitrary Power into the Netherlands, and his Attempts to reduce the Kingdom of England under his Power, proved to be the very Things that ruined his Empire, and gave Rise to that State, that for a long time gave an helping hand to bring Spain low; but since the Peace of Munster, in 1648. has proved the greatest Support of that Remain∣der of the Monarchy still continuing in the Netherlands, against her grow∣ing Neighbours, of any in the World. We might here assign other Reasons for the Cadency of Spain, as the bloody Inquisition, the Depopulating of the Country, by the Discovery of the West-Indies, &c. But waving this at present, we shall enquire a little distinctly into the French Proceedings up∣on the said Account, and take in somewhat of other Nations, as they occur to our Purpose, before we come to draw the whole into a Conclusion. The Ancient Gallia, which was of every extensive Bounds, but subdivided into divers petty Kingdoms or Dynasties; as, indeed, the State of the In∣fant World seemed every-where to be so, fell under the Yoak of the Roman Empire, under the Conduct of Julius Caesar, and continued under the said Dominion, till that vast Monarchy began to totter, and then was one of first of those Countries that felt the Rage of those barbarous Nations, the Goths and Huns, but most of all, the Franks out of Germany, who, about the Year 424, beginning to break in upon it, did by degrees make themselves Masters of the greatest part of it, and withal changed the old Name of Gaul into that of France. The first Race of their Kings were valiant and brave Princes, but some of them being too much taken up with the pre∣valent Humour of those Times, made such a Division of the Kingdom, as they had Number of Sons to govern them: But being united again, this Merovingian Family, now at length strangely degenerating from their an∣cient Valour, gave way to the Rise of the Carolovinian Race in the Person of Pepin, and was so called from the Famous Charles Martel Mayor of the Palace in the last King's Reign, and Father to this Pepin, who proved a Warlike Prince, and did great Feats in Italy against the Lombards. He was succeeded by his Son Charles, surnamed the Great, who extended the French Monarchy beyond the Bounds even of the ancient Gallia: For he made him∣self in a Manner Lord of all Italy, by the entire Conquest he made of the Kingdom of the Lombards, and overcame the Saxons, and subdued Germany, beat the Sclavonians, Danes and Huns, routed the Saracens, and reduced Spain as far as the River Iberus, under his Obedience, and at Rome was pro∣claimed Emperor of the West: And, in Truth, he was the greatest Prince that ever was in this Part of the World, since the Dissolution of the Roman Empire; and had his Successors been as Wise and Valiant as he, and pur∣sued the Steps he took, I cannot see any Thing that could have hindred them in the Revolution of a few Years, from erecting an Empire as extensive and formidable, as that of old Rome it self. But Charles his Successors falling in∣to the Error of their Predecessors, disjoined the Empire of Germany from the Kingdom of France, and part of their Dominions being invaded and possest by the Normans, and the Royal Authority decaying by degrees, this Race also being enfeebled with Age, tho' they were not yet 240 Years old, made way for Hugh Capet to ascend the Throne. This Man thinking to
make amends for the Badness of his Title, by the Goodness of his Conces∣sions, to the Nobles of his Kingdom that had been very Instrumental in his Advancement, remitted a great many of the Ancient Royal Preroga∣tives, and gave them the Titles of Dukes and Earls of the Provinces they govern'd, upon Condition they should acknowledge themselves his Vassals, but yet not to be obliged to depend absolutely upon his Commands. Hence arose, besides the Dutchy of Normandy, on which also depended that of Britany, the Dutchies of Burgundy, Aquitain and Gascoigny; the Earldoms of Flanders, Champaign and Thoulouse; to which, if we add, that the Coun∣ties of Vienna, Provence, Savoy and Dauphine, belonged to the Kingdom of Arelate, which was part of the German Empire, we shall find the French Monarchy reduced from those most extensive Bounds it had in the Days of Charlemaign to a very narrow Compass, and to reunite those again has been mainly the Struggle and Endeavour of the succeeding Kings of France; A∣bout some of which they had a long and terrible Contest with the English, which yet the French effected in a great measure, by the Time of the Reign of our K. Henry VII. when Charles VIII. married Anne, Inheritrix of the Dutchy of Britany, tho' she had been solemnly married before to Maximilian, K. of the Romans, and afterwards Emperor: And the Suffering of this to be accomplish'd, was a foul Blot in K. H's Politicks, and lesned very much the Reputation he had gained of being a Prince of great Wisdom and Foresight. But, though France thus strengthned her Vital Parts by the Acquisition of Britany, which she took Care to retain even by the Marriage of Charles's Successor, Lewis XII. to this Ann of Bretaigne his Relict, in Expectation of Issue, though without Success; and that notwithstanding this, Francis I. Lewis's Nephew, did not only retain that Dutchy, but is generally allowed to have been a Prince, that aspired not so much at being Emperor of Ger∣many, as Universal Monarch of Europe; Yet neither would the Conjuncture of the Times, nor the Strength of his Cotemporaries, by any means admit of it in his Person: And as for the succeeding Princes of the House of Valois, tho' H. II. made an Attempt to unite Scotland to France, by the Marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots to his Son Francis the Dauphine, (which would have been a great Blow to England) yet no Issue coming from that Match, they were henceforward so far from doing any Thing memorable, as to the Ex∣tent of their Dominion and Conquest, that the Kingdom fell into an un∣happy Civil War; which, though at first it had its Rise from the Humours and Passions of the Princes of the Blood; and the Ministers, yet it proved at length to be a Religious War between the Roman Catholicks, or the League, and the Huguenots, which never could be extinguished, till H. IV. of the House of Bourbon, and, by Right, K. of France, upon the Death of Hen. III. the last Prince of the House of Valois, had renounced the Protestant Reli∣gion, and thereupon was confirmed in the Supream Authority before be∣longing to him. This Prince did anew lay the Foundation of the French Greatness, which was carried on in his Son's Reign, Lewis XIII. (tho' of himself no otherwise a wise Prince, than by his Steadiness to his Ministers) by the wonderful Management of Cardinal Richlieu, both by Sea and Land, to a very great Heighth; by whose wise Conduct Spain, long before lan∣guishing under a diseased Body, was brought lower and lower; and what the Emperor Ferdinand II. aimed at in the Reduction of Germany by the
War that was begun there (being no other than an absolute Sovereignty) as well as the Swedes, whose best Pretensions under the Brave King Gustavus Adolphus, was to rescue the Religion and Liberty of it; tho' in the Conse∣quence, it appeared to be no other than a Conquest of it, redounded in a great Measure to the Advantage of France, and the same was confirmed into her by the Westphalian Treaty in 1648. And all this done upon the Continent, while we our selves were seemingly enfeebled rather than strengthned by the Conjunction of Scotland, tho' in reality, it must be attri∣buted to the weak Administration of our Princes, which terminated in the cruellest Intestine War that ever befel any Nation, and was attended with the saddest Catastrophe: And the Government it self, after various Com∣mutations of Form and subsequent Revolutions, degenerated into Anarchy, of which France failed not to make Advantage under the Ministry of Car∣dinal Mazarine. But our Unsettlement at last terminating in the Restorati∣on of our ancient Form of Government, in the Person of Charles II. about which time hapned the Death of Mazarine in France, who left this Legacy to his Prince, That he should Govern himself, and not entirely trust to any Fa∣vourite tho' Charles quickly discovered, that the Remembrance of his ad∣verse and exiled Fortune, which usually makes Men wise upon a Change of Condition, had been quite effaced by the prosperous State his Restoration brought him to; yet Lewis never fail'd to stick close to the Advice of his Minister, and what Effects it has had since upon the Affairs of Europe, is better past over in silence, than raked up in this place: However, we were weak enough to quit our entire Interest upon the Continent, by the Sale of Dunkirk to the French, which as it gave an Accession of Strength into that Nation to the Sea-ward, as Lorain did to the Land-ward, so it weakned both our own and the Spanish Hands; as did also the Dutch War that suc∣ceeded between us and the Republick of Holland in 1665, neither Nation having gotten any Thing but Blows at Sea, while the French by the Irrup∣tion they made into Flanders into 1667, got all by Land: And, tho' they were for a short time coup'd up by the Tripple Alliance of England, Sweden and Holland; yet they having Artifice enough to disjoin the first from the rest, as that also did by the second, the third was left single to be invaded by the other in 1672, and that with such a Torrent of Success, that nothing but the Providence of God, and the Success of the young Prince of Orange, now in this Hurry and common Calamity of his Country, restored to the Honours and Commands of his Ancestors, could have saved that di∣stressed State from falling under the French Dominion. But tho' the Blow was suddam, and almost unexpected, yet the Commonness of the Danger not only awaken'd Spain, the Emperor and the Empire to come out of their slow Pace to the Relief of it, but the French Progress so alarmed the People of England, that the King thought it high time to slink himself out of the French Alliance: But instead of falling in with the Weight of the rest of the Confederacy, which was the Subjects Desire, and his true Interest, he was contented to set up his Mediation of Peace between the Contending Parties, with the Reception whereof by all that were engaged in the War, we shall conclude this Introduction that brings us down to the Year 1676, from whence our present History commences its Original, and compre∣hends a Period of about Two and Twenty Years.
A Compleat History OF EUROPE, From the Beginning of the Treaty of Nimeguen, &c. NIMEGVEN is a City of the Low-Countries, seat∣ed upon the Side of an Hill, which is the last of Ger∣many, and stoops upon the River Woal, that wash∣eth the lower Part of the Town, and divides it from the Betow, an Island lying all upon flat low Ground, between the Woal and the Old Rhine, which is esteemed to be the ancient Seat of those People, whom the Romans called Batavians; and whom, for their Bravery, and love of Liberty, they took into their Confederacy, when they had subjected all the Neighbour∣ing Parts of Gaul and Germany: It stands to the South of Arheim, and is about two Leagues distant from it, six from Vtretch, which is on the East of it, three from Cleves to the West, and twenty from Cologn to the same. It was in the Year 1591, ta∣ken by Prince Maurice of Orange, for the States, after it had en∣dured a sharp Siege; and in 1672, fell into the Hands of the French, amongst the greatest part of the Dutch Towns and Provinces; tho', to its Glory, it must be said, that it was al∣most the only Place in all those Provinces that fought for its Liberty. Here it was this mighty Treaty was set on foot be∣tween the most Serene Confederates on the one Hand, and the French Monarch on the other, by the single Mediation of Charles the II, King of Great Britain; (that of the Pope's, after much
Delay and many Debates, being at last rejected by all the Par∣ties concerned in the Negotiation) which Treaty spun out into a great length, and of which, together with the intervening Actions of the War, we shall endeavour to give as clear and satisfactory a View, as is consistent with the Nature and Cir∣cumstance of Things, and compatible to the Design of this Treatise, which extends it self much further, even to our pre∣sent Time. The Congress may be said to have been opened from the time of the Arrival of the Two English Mediators,July, 1676. who were Sir Wil∣liam Temple, and Sir Lionel Jenkins upon the Place of Treaty, where they found only Two of the Parties engaged in the War present, viz. the French and Dutch Plenipotentiaries, the for∣mer of which were exceeding eager to set the Negotiation on foot, and therefore pretended very quickly to enter upon Points and Terms of great Confidence with one of the Mediators, and upon Matters that gave Light to the whole Design of France; which was no other, in the main, than to procure a Separate Peace, if possible, with Holland, and that by the Intervention of the Prince of Orange, without whom they thought it could not be well effected: And when they found the Nail would not drive that way, they quickly turned their Battery upon Pen∣sionary Fagel, tho' with as little hopes of Success. But the lat∣ter did not shew so much Forwardness in the Matter; for the French, soon after their Arrival, demanding Audience of the Mediators, declared they came to make the Offer of exhibiting their full Powers into their Hands, not doubting, as they said, of the Dutch being ready to do the same: They, upon being acquainted with that Overture, replied, That it was in the Choice of the French Embassadors to do it when they pleased; but they did not conceive the hastening of it would gain any time, since they had no Orders to make that Pace without a previous Concert with their Allies; and consequently, tho' the French should do it, yet they would, at present, neither exhi∣bit their own, nor make any Reflections, as might be necessary, upon those of the French; which gave the French occasion to press the other extreamly, upon making Instances to all their Allies to hasten the Treaty, or else to declare they would enter upon the Negotiation without them; intimating withal, That their Master was resolved to recal them, if there was any much longer Delay, which the Dutch promised to acquaint the States with, to endeavour to dispose them to fix some time, and ex∣pect their Orders accordingly. In the mean while, the Allies found, or took as many Occasions as they could, of delaying the Dispatch of their Ministers to the Congress, while they had Hopes of hindring the Dutch from proceeding without them; and this they believed might be effected till the Campagne were over, from the Events whereof the several-Princes might
the better take their Measures for the Conditions of a Peace, that should be proposed or insisted on in this Treaty; Insomuch, that this Disposition of theirs was so well pursued, that no other Embassadors arrived at Nimeguen till the nd of Nov. following, besides those above-mentioned, and the Swede, who was of the French side; nor had then neither, in all probability, but that about the End of Sept. the French Embassadors gave the Media∣tors notice, That their Master having made so many Advances towards the Peace, but having been so ill seconded by the Pro∣ceedings of the Confederates, and observing their Slowness in coming to the Treaty, he was resolved to recall his Embassa∣dors, unless the Confederates should repair to Nimeguen with∣in the Space of one Month: Tho', after all, Count Kinkski, the second Person in the Imperial Embassie, whether through real Indisposition, or under Pretence thereof, is uncertain, staid at Cologne till the new Year began; and neither of his Col∣leagues came in many Months after, without one of which, to wit, the Bishop of Gurck, the first in Commission, Count Kinkski had no Power to agrëe on any thing further than Preliminaries. In the mean time several Actions happened before the Cam∣pagne ended,Maestricht besieg'd by the Prince of Orange. but not of that concurring Nature, as to dispose all Parties to promote this great Work in Earnest. The Prince of Orange, in Concert with the Spaniards and German Princes, near the Lower Rhine, resolved, about the End of July, to lay Siege to Maestricht, the only Town of the Dutch Provinces re∣maining in the French Hands, of all their Conquest during the Course of this War; and which, tho' the strongest of the Dutch Frontiers, when it was taken by them, yet had been fortify'd by the French since it fell into their Hands, with all the Advan∣tages both of Art and Expence; besides a Garrison in it of Eight Thousand chosen Men, under a daring Commander, Monsieur Calvo. The Trenches were no sooner opened, but the Siege was carried on with such Bravery, with so many, and desperate As∣saults, for the Space of about Three Weeks, that it was gene∣rally believed the Place would at last be taken. The Prince, or the Rhinegrave (who was designed for Governour of the Town, as his Father before had been) were ever in the Head of the Attacks, and made great Use, as well as Proofs, of the great Bravery of the English Troops upon all those Occasions. Many of the Outworks were taken with a great Slaughter on both sides, but they were still supplied with new Retrenchments, and them made by all the Art and Industry of a resolute Captain, and brave Soldiers within. It happened that about the middle of Aug. as the Prince was exposing himself upon all Occasions to carry on the Siege, he received a Musket Shot in his Arm; at which, perceiving they that were about him were much daunted, he immediately pulled off his Hat with the Arm that was hurt, and
waved it about his Head, as a Signal it was only a Flesh-Wound, and that the Bone was safe; wherewith they were all revived, and the Prince went on without Interruption in all the Paces of the Siege. But a cruel Sickness falling into his Army, weaken∣ed it more than all the Assaults they had given the Town; which, together with the Germans not coming up with the Supplies they had promised, and upon which Assurance the Siege had been undertaken; and the Rhinegrave, who, next to the Prince, was the Spring of the Action, happening to be wounded soon after, and so forced to withdraw into a Neighbouring Castle from the Camp, where he died; all unfortunately concurred to dis∣hearten the Army very much, and consequently the Siege grew very faint; and this not only gave Monsieur Schomberg an Op∣portunity to besiege and take Aire, but Encouragement to march even through the Heart of the Spanish Low-Countries, to the Relief of Maestricht: Upon whose Approach it was agreed in a Council of War,Siege raised. that the Siege should be raised, with which the Campagne ended in the Dutch and Spanish Provinces. However, to counterbalance this Disappointment in some measure, and to revive the Hopes of the Allies, that the Forces of Germany would henceforward be vigorous, and gain some considerable Advantages over the French, Philipsburg was this Year,Philipsburg surrender'd to the Im∣perial Ar∣my. about the latter End of Sept. surrendred up to the Impe∣rial Army for want of Provisions, having been blocked up and besieged from the Beginning of June: And this indeed hap∣pened as much against the common Opinion and Expectation, as the contrary Event did in the Siege of Maestricht. The Affairs of Denmark and Brandenburg prospered all this while against Sweden, who was in Alliance with France, and that with much Advantage in most of the Sieges and Encounters that passed between them this Summer, and the first part of the succeeding Winter; So that the Swedes seemed to be losing apace all that they had been so long in Possession of in Germany; But the Imperial Forces, tho' joined with those of the several Princes upon the Vpper Rhine, had for all that made but little Progress in their designed Conquests there, and were forc'd to seek their old Winter-Quarters upon the German side of the River, which was no less a true and indisputed Decision of the small Success of this Campagne, than it was a powerful Motive to incline some of the Confederates to think more seriously of a Peace; and particularly the Dutch, who began now to grow very impatient after it, especially in that they found France would make no great Difficulty in granting them any thing in Contest between them, seeing they privately made Offers by their Emissaries, especially at Amsterdam, of such a Reglement of Commerce as they themselves could wish for, the Restitu∣tion of Maestricht, and all the Satisfaction imaginable to the
Prince of Orange that he could pretend to upon the account of his Losses, and their Seisure in the Course of this War. To return therefore to the Business of the Peace: It was about the middle of Feb. 1677. N. S. before the Assembly was compleatly formed, the King of England's single Mediation by all Parties accepted, and that of the Pope's finally rejected, the several Acts signed, put into the Hands of the Mediators, and by them exchanged among the several Parties: And all these Preliminaries of the Treaty being thus dispatch'd, the respe∣ctive Embassadors did also, by Agreement, put into the same Hands their several Propositions or Pretensions, which on the Emperor's part were, That the King and Kingdom of France should restore to him,The De∣mands of the several Princes. and to the Empire, and to all his Allies, whatever they had taken from them during the Course of this present War; make Repa∣ration for all the Damages they had suffered; and that a Peace should be established upon the best and surest Grounds that could be devised. France in theirs seemed to demand little of the Empire; only they said, That the King having desired no∣thing more passionately than the Religious Observation of the Treaties of Westphalia, his Majesty would gladly see Germany a second time owe the Re-establishment of its Repose to the Ob∣servation of the same Treaties; and for that Effect he demand∣ed, they might be fully and entirely re-established. The Spaniards insisted upon the Restitution of all the Places they had lost, and Reparation for all the Damages they had sustained from France since the Year 1665, whether by Sea or Land, by demolishing, burning, or otherwise; and that the French King should give compleat Satisfaction to all the Con∣federates; and by three different Articles demanded the same thing of the Swedes. Whereas France, on the other side, said, That their King being, contrary to Justice, and the Obligation of the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle, attack'd by the Catholick King, his Majesty had reason to pretend, that in respect to that Crown, all things should remain in the Condition the Fortune of War had put them, without Prejudice to the King's Rights, which were to continue still in full Force and Power. The Danes insisted, That France should give them compleat Satisfaction, and reimburse all the Charges of the War; and by Four Articles required of the Swedes, That betwixt the Two Kings, and Two Kingdoms, all Things should be restored in the same State they were in before the War that was end∣ed between the Two Nations by the Treaties of West∣phalia: That the Treaties of Rochilde and Copenhagen should be abolished: That all the Provinces which had been dis∣membred from Denmark and Norway, should be restored to the Danes: That all that the Swedes possess'd in the Em∣pire should be taken from them: That Wismar, and the Isle
of Rugen should remain in the Possession of the Danes: And that, for the Security of his Danish Majesty and his Kingdoms, they might be allowed to put Garrisons into all the strong Places of Sweden that lay upon the Frontiers of the Two King∣doms. But France on her side proposed, That seeing the King had not declared War against the King of Denmark; but that his Danish Majesty, running contrary to the Treaty of Copenha∣gen, made in the Year 1660, (for Performance whereof the King was Guarrantee) had attack'd Sweden; his most Christian Ma∣jesty was willing to desist from all Hostilities on his part, provi∣ded that the foresaid Treaty and those of Westphalia were re-established. As to what concerned France and the States-General, (tho', in truth, Things were as good as agreed between them before) the latter demanded that Maestricht, Dalen, Fangumont, with all the Dependancies of the first, should be restored to them; A Reglement of Commerce, with a Renunciation of all Pre∣tensions each Party might have upon the other; And as for the greater Damages they had sustained, and whereof they might demand Reparation, they were willing, for the publick Tran∣quility, to sacrifice them all, provided Satisfaction might be gi∣ven to their Allies. To this were added, Sixteen Articles concerning a full Satisfaction to be made the Prince of Orange, in regard to what depended on the Crown of France; and par∣ticularly, the Restauration of the Fortifications of the City of Orange, that were ruined in the Year 1660, and of the Castle demolished in 1663, the Rights of Toll upon Salt and other Commodities, as well upon the Rhosne, as through the Princi∣pality of Orange, the Prerogative of Coining Money, of Laick Patronage for Nomination to the Bishoprick, together with the Exemptions, Priviledges, and other Immunities granted to the Inhabitants of the said Principality, and particularly by Lewis XIII. And as for Sweden, they required no more, but that the future Treaty might contain some Regulations, for obviating the frequent Inconveniencies that happened concerning Com∣merce between the Two Nations: To which France on her part answered, That seeing the Union that had always been between the Crown of France and the States, was only inter∣rupted upon account of some Causes of Discontent, which were easie, in the present Posture of things, to be removed, and for the future prevented; His Majesty was very ready to restore the States to his former Amity, and to hearken favourably to all Propositions that might be made to him on their part, both in respect to their Demands of Restitution, Treaty of Com∣merce, and the Re-establishment of the Prince of Orange; tho' the French Embassadors occasionally opposed the Pretentions of the Count d'Auvergne thereunto, demanding, That his Mar∣quisate, and Town of Bergen-op-Zoom should be restored to all
the Rights of Sovereignty, which the other Towns of Hol∣land enjoyed, conform to the Treaties of the Pacification of Chent. The Elector of Brandenburg demanded, That France should make Reparation for the Damages his Territories had suffered by the French Forces during the Course of this War; That all Security should be given him for the same Territories; And that all his Allies should be comprehended in the general Treaty. But the French had no Propositions to make to the E∣lector, besides those that were made to the Emperor and the Empire, which comprehended the full Performance of the Treaties of Westphalia. And as what concerned the Swedes, in all the Proposals they made to the Emperor, the Kings of Spain and Denmark, the States-General, and the Elector of Branden∣burg, besides the Renovation of their former Amity and good Correspondence, their whole Demands consisted in the Execu∣tion of the Treaties of Westphalia and Copenhagen; which, in effect, contained the Restitution of all that had been taken from that Crown. The Duke of Lorrain's Pretensions were also put into the Hands of the Mediators, Seal'd as the rest were; but they did not open them, upon the French his acquainting them, That they had not received any Counter-Pretensions from Court in relation to that Duke, whereof they believed the Reason to be, that no Minister of his had yet appeared at the Congress: Tho' another Pretence was afterwards started, for the Rejecti∣on of the Duke's Offers, from the Confederates refusing to ad∣mit of the Sieur Duker, the Bishop of Strasburg's Envoy, into the Assembly; whereas the Danes did the same by the Mini∣sters of the Duke of Holstein Gottorp, for his being an Ally of Sweden, protected by France, and so standing dispossess'd by the King of Denmark. Indeed, their Pretensions against Lorrain had never yet been made since the Death of the late Duke, and would have been hard to draw up by the ablest Ministers or Advocates themselves; and therefore they thought fit to decline, and reserve them for the Terms of a Peace, when they should be able to prescribe rather than to treat upon them. However, they came afterwards to be known; and were to this Purpose, That as Heir to his Predecessors, the Duke hoped from the Justice of the King, that he would restore to him the Dutchies of Lorrain and Bar, with their Dependencies, his Titles, Records, Movables, and Effects, taken from him; and make Reparation for the Towns, Boroughs, Castles and Vil∣lages, that were ruined throughout all his Dominions. Neither were the Propositions of the Dukes of Brunswick and Lunemburg made publick, because the Ministers of those Princes kept incognito, pretending to the Character and Rank of Em∣bassadors: But notwithstanding all the Instances that ever they
made, no Crowned Head would give way to their Demands. From all which Proposals put together, it easily appeared to the World, what wise Men knew before, how little Hopes there were of a Peace from the Motions of this Treaty, in the pre∣sent Circumstances of Affairs; and how wholly dependent it seemed to be on the Course and Influence of future Events in the Progress of the War. In the mean time the Dutch's Pulse beat high for a Peace, notwithstanding the joint Efforts of the Prince of Orange, the Pensionary Fagel, &c. at Home, to stave it off in the present Circumstances of it; and the former's Endeavours, by the In∣tervention of Sir William Temple, to enter into such a Confi∣dence with the King of England, his Uncle, in relation to it, as might bring it about upon better Considerations, and with greater Security to the Spanish Netherlands. But it was his Misfortune to find little Security or Sincerity on that side; and the Project that was sent him from thence, gave so little Satisfaction, that he resolved rather to continue the War at any rate, saying, That tho' he expected a very ill Beginning of the Campagne, and to make an ill Figure in it himself, and to bear the Shame of Faults that others would commit; yet, if the Emperor performed what he had promised, the Campagne would not end as it began; that however, he was in, and must go on; and when one is at High Mass, one is at it. He must stay till it is done, be∣cause of the Greatness of the Crowd which will not let him get out sooner. But how slow soever the Confederates were in the Advances they made towards finishing this Work, the French thought fit to quicken them towards the very beginning of the Year, by blocking up of Cambray and Valenciennes; and having provi∣ded sufficient Magazines in the Winter for the Subsistance of their Troops, they began to break into Flanders, and those Parts of Germany that are on the other side of the Rhine, with such Devastations of burning and destroying, as not only had not been used by either Party since the Commencement of the War, but such as can hardly be parallel'd in History; and yet they softned it with the Name of, Putting the Frontiers of Ger∣many out of a Condition of being able to furnish Provisions to any great Army, with which they were from thence threat∣ned; and the Complaints of the Allies to King Charles, of this new Manner of making War while a Peace was treating under his Mediation, signified just nothing: For the Thing was done, and their Point was gained; which was to prevent the early March of the Germans into Alsatia, that would divert those Forces the French resolved to employ this Spring in Flanders, before the Dutch could take the Field, and march to the Re∣lief of those Places they intended to attack.
Valenciennes having been for some time blocked up as above∣said, the Trenches were opened before it the 9th of March fol∣lowing, the French King being at the Siege in Person; and after the usual Approaches,Valenciennes besieg'd. there were Orders given to attack the Counterscarp, with the two Half-Moons that flanked a Crowned Work; and that the Men should make a Lodgment on the Front of that Work which covers another that is before the Gate of the Town. But the Troops marching cross those Half-Moons, attacked that great Crowned Work both on the Front and ides, and, after some Resistance, enter'd it on all Hands, slay∣ing before them, and pursued those that fled so far, that they gained the Bridge and Second Work; and, by a Wicket, where they could not pass but singly, made themselves Masters of the Town-Gate; So that in about half an Hours time, that considerable Fortress fell into the French Hands, which was on the 17th, Eight Days after the opening of the Trenches. From hence the King marched with a mighty Army, and with one part of it laid Siege to Cambray, which, after Five Days, Trenches open, was surrender'd to him upon Articles, as the rest of the Spanish Towns had been, tho' the Cittadel held out some Days longer; While the other part of his Forces, under the Command of his Brother the Duke of Orleans, invested St. Omers. In the mean time the Dutch having received their Payments due from Spain, and finding the French vigorous in the Prosecution of their Designs upon Flanders, whilst the Treaty of Peace served only for an Amusement, resolved to go on with the War for another Campagne, being kept up to this Resolution by the Vi∣gour and Constancy of the Prince of Orange, in pressing them to the Observance of their Treaties, and pursuit of their In∣terests in the Defence of the Spanish Netherlands. The French had no sooner made a Motion this Season, but the Prince pre∣pared to do the same by that of the Dutch Troops, and pressed the Spaniards to have theirs in a readiness to join him, and with all imaginable Endeavours provided for the Subsistence of his Army in their March through the Spanish Territories, which the other took no care of. But notwithstanding all the Appli∣cation that could be used, he was not able to come time enough to the Relief either of Valenciennes or Cambray. However, not to be wanting what in him lay to save the rest, he marched with the single Forces of the States, and without either Troops, or so much as Guides, furnished him by the Spaniards, directly towards St. Omer, bent upon raising the Siege with the Hazard of a Battle, tho' labouring under never so many Disadvantages for it; which the Duke of Orleans on his part did not decline. For, having left a few Troops to defend the Trenches, he marched with the rest of the Army to meet the Prince, and in the way was reinforced by the Duke of Luxemburg, with all the Troops the French King could spare out of his Army,
leaving only enough behind to continue the Siege of the Citta∣del of Cambray, which was not yet surrender'd. Both Armies engaged with a great deal of Bravery at Mount Cassel,The Battle of Mount-Cassel. where, after a sharp Dispute, the First Regiment of the Dutch Foot began to break and fall into Disorder; but the Prince rallied them again several times, and renewed the Charge; yet he was at last bore down by the plain Hight of his Men, whom he was forced himself to resist like Enemies, and fall in among them with his Sword in Hand, and cutting the first cross over the Face, cried aloud, Rascal, I'll set a Mark on thee at least, that I may hang thee at last. But all that ever he could do, could not inspire any Courage into his dispirited Countrymen; and therefore being forced to yield to the Stream that carried him back to the rest of his Troops which yet stood firm; With them, and such of the rest as he could gather together, he made a Re∣treat that wanted little of the Honour of a Victory. However, the natural Consequence of this Battle was, the Surrender of St. Omer and the Cittadel of Cambray, (which happened about the 20th of Apr.) and a more eager Desire in the Dutch Pro∣vinces after the Conclusion of a Peace, seeing they had been left alone by the Spaniards in this Brunt; and that they con∣ceived no great Hopes of the Conference that had been held at Wesel, between the Elector of Brandenburg, the Danish Em∣bassador, Pensionary Fagel, Admiral Van Trump, the Envoys of the Electors of Cologn, Treves, Palatine, of the Princes of Bruns∣wick and Bishop of Munster; besides the Duke of Newbourg, who was there in Person, concerning the Operations of the Cam∣pagne on the German side. However, France observing every Motion both of her Friends and Enemies, and more particularly the Temper of the Eng∣lish Parliament, who were mightily allarm'd with the Progress of her Arms, and had Addressed the King to concert Measures for the Preservation of Flanders, had so much regard to the Jealousies raised both in England and Holland, of their designing an entire Conquest of the rest of Flanders; that the King, after having gained those three important Frontier Towns so early in the Spring, and dispersed his Army into Quarters of Refresh∣ment, went to Dunkirk, from whence he sent the Duke of Ce∣qui to Compliment Charles II. and to carry him a Letter,The Fr. K.'s Letter to K. C. 11. con∣taining in substance; That tho' his willingness to come to a Peace did not at all promote the Conclusion thereof, yet he was ready, amidst the Prosperities wherewith Heaven was pleased to favour him, to agree to a General Truce for some Years, as the surest means of restoring Tranquility to Europe, in case his Ally the King of Sweden was of the same Mind: And seeing he could have no free Correspondence with that King, he pray'd his Britannick Majesty to inform himself of his Intentions; not doubting but he was sufficiently perswaded, of the sincere De∣sire
he had to second the good Offices of his Mediation; yea, and to contribute all that in him lay, for the procuring a Gene∣ral Peace, tho' he might have Ground to expect considerable Advantages from his Armies. There were various Constructi∣ons made of this Letter, and it was generally believed to have been a Politick Fetch of the French King, to put the King of England upon waving the Declaration, which his Parliament so urgently sollicited; and Monsieur Beverning, the Dutch Pleni∣potentiary, who was the most forward of any for a Peace, yet resented it to that degree, that he said openly, the French were to be commended, who never neglected any thing of Importance, nor so much as Amusement; That France had given her Blow, and would now hinder the Allies to give theirs; That the Re∣serve of Sweden's Consent would be always a sure Pretence of staving off the Propositions of a Truce, if the Allies should ac∣cept it; That this it self could not be done, because Flanders would be left so open, as to be easily swallowed up by the next Invasion, having now no Frontier on either side; That the Towns now possess'd by France would in the time of a Truce grow absolutely French, and so be the harder to be restored by a Peace, or a War; That for his part, he desired to see the Peace concluded, contrary to the Politicks of Monsieur Van Benning∣ham, and the other Ministers of the Allies in England; affirm∣ing always, That notwithstanding all their Intelligences and Intrigues there, he was well assured, That the King of Eng∣land would not enter into the War to save the last Town in Flanders. In pursuance of this Confidence of his, he made all the Paces imaginable to compleat the Work, and such as were thought by some to be forwarder than his Commission, and very ill concerted with those of his Allies: So that, about the be∣ginning of the Month of July, all Points were adjusted between the French and Dutch; and Monsieur Beverning began to play the part of something more than a Mediator, pressing on his Allies towards a Peace in a somewhat rough manner, tho' but with very small effect; for there was little more done of any moment towards it the rest of this Summer, save the Messages that were carried to and fro about the Business of the Duke of Lorrain, whose Cause the whole Body of the Allies interested themselves in so far, as to press for an Answer to his Pretensions delivered in by President Canon. But the French finding now, that their former Exception, of his wanting a Minister at the Congress, would not do, raised another to stave off the fore∣said Instances, and declared, They could give no Answer about Lorrain, till the Bishop of Strasburg's Agents were received by the Allies. Upon this, the Emperor made an invincible Dif∣ficulty, declaring, He would never treat with a Vassal of his own, and in these Conferences about Lorrain, the French Em∣bassadors began to insinuate to the Mediators, That their Ma∣ster
never intended that Matter to be treated as a Principal, but only as an Accessary to the Treaty; As they did also shew themselves positive in having full Satisfaction and Restitution made to the Swedes, before they would conclude the Peace. It was believed, since it was much discoursed of, that there was a new Alliance entred into between those two Crowns at Paris; and that it was by Concert between them, that this Attenite was given by the Swedes to the Congress. Neither was there any Decisive Action in the course of the rest of this Campagne, which was ended in Flanders by a successless Attempt made by the Prince of Orange to surprize Charleroy. And if, on the Ger∣man side, the French thought they had the Advantage by taking of Fribourg in Octob. this Year, by a Feint of the Mareschal de Crequi, before the Duke of Lorrain could come up to relieve it, the City of Stetin's falling into the Hands of the Duke of Bran∣denburg this same Month, after a most vigorous Resistance of its Garrison, left the Scales even as they were before between the two Leagues. The Campagne being ended as aforesaid, the Prince of Orange, who had long desired to take a Tour into England, and had to that purpose, the June before, sent Monsieur Bentink over, to make way with the King for such a Journey (who at length granted him leave, tho' with great Indifferency and Difficulty enough) did, upon the 9th of Octob. Land at Har∣wich, and rid Post from thence to New-Market, where the Court then was, and where he industriously declined to enter upon any Conferences about the Peace or War, as being re∣solved first to see the Young Princess; which made the King, to humour him, leave that place sooner by some Days than he designed. The Prince, upon his Arrival in Town, had no sooner set sight on that Incomparable Princess, our late Sove∣reign Lady, but he was so pleased with her Person, and all those Signs of such an Humour as had been before described unto him, that he immediately made his Suit both to the King and Duke, which was very well received and assented to; but upon Condition, That the Terms of the Peace abroad might be first agreed on between them; which, after many Contestations on both sides, the Prince would ne'er agree to, saying, The World would believe he had made that Match for himself at their Cost; and that he would never sacrifice his Honour to his Love. He grew at last to be so sullen upon the matter, that he desired a Friend to tell the King, That he designed to stay but two Days longer in England, if things continued still on the same Foot; That it repented him he had ever come over; And that the King must choose how they were to live hereafter, for he was sure it must be either like the greatest Friends or the greatest Enemies. This so wrought upon the King, who at the same time expressed the great Opinion he had of the Prince's Hone∣sty,
that he ordered Sir William Temple the Messenger, to go immediately to carry hm the News, That he should have his Wife. Accordingly the Match was declared that Evening at the Committee, before any other in Court knew any thing of it. The Marriage was no sooner consummated, but they very quickly fell into Debate upon the Terms of the Peace, and had various Discourses of the Ambition of France, the Necessity of a good Frontier to Flanders; and it was at last agreed upon these Terms; That all should be restored by France to the Em∣peror and Empire that had been taken in the War, the Dutchy of Lorrain to that Duke, and all on both sides between France and Holland; and to Spain, the Towns of Aeth, Oudenard, Cour∣tray, Tournay, Conde, Valenciennes, St. Gillaine, and Bince; That the Prince should endeavour to procure the Consent of Spain, and the King that of France: To this Purpose he was to dispatch away a Person immediately over with the Proposition, who should be instructed to enter into no Reasonings upon it, but demand a positive Answer in Two Days, and then forth∣with return; and my Lord Duras, a Favourite of the Duke's, was at last the Person pitched upon and sent. But he after the Delivery of his Message, was prevailed with to stay longer than his time; and, after all, came away without any positive An∣swer. From which manner of Procedure we may discover foul Prevarication somewhere; and so the Business came to be drawn out into so many Messages and Returns from France, that at last it dwindled into nothing; especially, after the Departure of the Prince for Holland, who had spirited the Vigour of the whole Resolution; which Departure happened to be with his Princess on the 21st of Nov. However the News of the Match had got to Nimeguen some time before; and if the Confederates did before this begin to hope more than ever, that it would not be long before England declared in their Favours, they made no doubt of it now. But it had quite another Effect in Holland, especially at Amsterdam, where the French Emissaries found the Secret of raising Jealousies of the Measures taken be∣tween the King and Prince upon this new Alliance, as dange∣rous to the Liberty of their Country; and to make it there believed, that by the Match the King and Duke had wholly brought over the Prince into their Interest and Sentiments, whereas the Prince went, indeed, away possess'd of having drawn them into his; tho' they were all equally mistaken. But how different soever their Apprehensions abroad might be of Things, the King in England quite receded from his Engage∣ments to the Prince, of entring into the War with all the Con∣federates, in case of no direct and immediate Answer from France upon the Terms of the Peace; and contented himself to send Mr. Thynne over into Holland with a Draught of an Alliance to be made with the Dutch, in order to force France
and Spain into a Compliance with the Propositions agreed on, and to consign the same into the Hands of Mr. Hyde, then at the Hague, which was done, and the Treaty Signed on the 16th of Jan. tho' not without great Difficulties, and much Dissatisfaction on the part of the Prince of Orange, who was yet covered in it by the private Consent of the Spanish Minister there in behalf of his Master; so that the War could not break out but upon France, in case of their Refusal. And if an imaginary Jealousie in Holland, of the Prince's Conduct since his Marriage, made them very uneasie among themselves, and daily more and more disposed towards a Peace; the News that came at this time of the French's taking from them the Island of Tobago, with all the Vessels that were in that Port, as well as their Ammunition in the Fort there, besides the Death of Binks, Admiral of Zealand, and the utter Ruine of that Co∣lony, did no less sensibly affect them. But what was a more for∣midable Blow than all the rest, was the vast Progress of the French Army this Spring in the Spanish Netherlands, where they carried all before them, without any Opposition in whatever they attempted: For, towards the end of Feb. the French King marching at the Head of his Army, and carrying the Queen and Ladies to Metz, seemed to threaten either Lutzemburg, Na∣mur, or Mons: But having drawn the Spanish Forces that way, all on a sudden, and to the no less Surprize of the French them∣selves than of the Confederates, he crossed the Countries, and in so much haste,Ghent be∣sieg'd and taken. that by the 4th of March he sat down before Ghent, which, by his Orders, had been invested the 1st of the same Month; and notwithstanding the Besieged cut down their Dikes, and drowned part of the Country, yet in a few Days both Town and Cittadel too were carried; and the Town of Ypre run the same Fate before the end of the Month, tho' the Garrison made a gallant Resistance. However, tho' all the Confederates exaggerated the Importance of these Losses, yet they could not excite England to any speedy and open Decla∣ration. The Affairs of the Allies being thus so much perplex'd on all hands, and the French now elated with so many Prosperi∣ties, and perhaps fearful least England at length would fall in∣to the Weight of the Confederacy, in the Month of Apr. made a publick Declaration of the Terms upon which they were re∣solved to make the Peace; a Copy whereof we have here in∣serted, and is as follows: A PROJECT of CONDITIONS of PEACE. HIS Majesty's inviolable Fidelity in adhering to his Alli∣ances, hath induced him never to listen any Proposals of Peace, other than such as shall give a full and perfect Satisfacti∣on to the King of Sweden; which likewise having been abso∣lutely
promised to his Majesty by the King of Great Britain, who was earnest to gain this Point, both for him and the States-General; he now likewise makes it the first Article that he in∣sists upon, and without which he cannot come to any Conclusion upon the rest. And because the Interest of the Duke of Gottorp is so united to the King of Sweden, that it makes a part of the Treaty of Copenhagen, for the Performance of which, his Majesty gave his Guarranty to that Crown; his Majesty desires, that he may now likewise be comprehended within this Treaty, upon such Terms as shall be satisfactory to himself. As for the Prince and Bishop of Strasbourg, the King doth pre∣cisely insist upon the Restitution of that Prince, and of all his Family, to all their Estates, Goods, Honours, and Prerogatives; and particularly, upon the Restitution of his Brother Prince William of Furstemburg, whose Liberty must be provided for by one of the first Articles of the Peace. For what concerns the Empire, as his Majesty doth still con∣tinue in the same Intention which he has expressed for its Peace, that he has been troubled to see it disturbed; that it was with much Concern of Mind he found himself compelled to carry the War thither; So he does yet adhere to those publick Decla∣rations, which he has so often made, That he will insist only upon the Restoring of the Treaties of Westphalia in all their Points, and to have them once more to be the Means of re∣storing Peace to Germany: Which induces him to offer this Al∣ternative to the Emperor; either that the Emperor shall restore Philipsburg, and have Fribourg restored to him; or else keep Philipsburg, and let his Majesty continue in the Possession of Fribourg, without making any the least Alteration in the other Matters contained in the said Treaties. As for what concerns Spain, since its Interest appears to be the most considerable in this War, and both England, Holland, and some Estates bordering upon Flanders, have further ex∣press'd their Desire, that that Crown should retain such a Fron∣tier in the Low-Countries, as might be able to make that a Bar, which they judge is so very important to their Safety; his Ma∣jesty has been pleased, at the Instance of the King of Great Britain, to agree to the Means for the Settling of it. And up∣on this Consideration it is, as his Majesty declared himself to that Prince, that he has offered already, and doth yet offer to restore to Spain these following Places, viz. Charleroy. Limburg, and its Appurtenances. Binch, and the Provostship thereof. Aeth, and its Chastellany. Oudenard, and its Chastellany there.
Courtray, and its Chastellany; the Verge of Menin only ex∣cepted. Gand, and its Dependances. St. Guillain; but with its Fortifications rased. For so many Places of Importance, and which his Majesty has taken so much Care, and been at so great Expence to Fortifie; he requires in exchange, that the King of Spain quit his Right to those Places which his Majesty hath possessed himself of in this last War. All Franche Compte. The Town of Valenciennes, and its Dependances. Conde, and its Dependances. Cambray and Cambresis. Air, St. Omers, and their Dependances. The Town of Ypre, and its Chastellany. The Places of Werwick and Werneton, on the River Lis. Bavay and Maubeuge, with their Dependances. Poperingue, Bailleul, and Cassel, with their Dependances. In a Word, that he quit his Right to all such Places and Countries as his Majesty hath now in his Possession, excepting those before-mentioned, which his Majesty is willing to restore to Spain; the Town of Charlemont he is willing to give up, or in lieu thereof, the Town of Dinant and Bouvines; upon Con∣dition that he, at the Choice of the King of Spain, will charge himself, that the Bishop of Liege shall quit his Right to Dinant, and that the Emperor and Empire shall give their Assent there∣unto. By this means the Spanish Frontier in the Netherlands, would, for the future, begin from the Sea to the Meuse, by Newport, Dixmude, Courtray, Oudenard, Aeth, Mons, Charleroy, and Namur. As for the Articles which concern the States-General, they are so very favourable, that they cannot but conclude, that his Majesty doth fully purpose to receive them into the former Friendship, after the Peace shall be concluded. His Majesty is willing to restore them Maestricht, and to agree to the Treaty of Commerce, in such Form as it was framed at Nimeguen with the Sieur Beverning. And to the End his Majesty may give the World the utmost Testimony of his sincere Intentions for the Peace, his Majesty, notwithstanding any Reason that might induce him to continue in Possession of Lorrain, is willing that Prince Charles be resto∣red to it, upon one of these two Alternatives, of which he gives him his Choice. First, That he be restored according to the Articles expressed in the Pyrenaean Treaty, without any Change or Alteration in any of them.
Or, Secondly, That he be restored generally to his whole Estate, except the Town of Nancy, which his Majesty will re∣tain, with Plenary Right of Sovereignty, and excepting such a Way as was agreed upon at the Treaty of 1661, to pass from the Frontiers of France into Alsatia, and all such Ways as shall be necessary to pass from France to Nancy, and from France to Metz, Brisac, and Franche Compte; upon Condition nevertheless, that to make him some Compensation for the Town of Nancy, his Majesty shall restore to him that of Toul, considerable for its Extent and Situation, and much more in respect for its Bishoprick. His Majesty demands likewise, That Long-Wic and its Pro∣vostship be quitted to him; but offereth withal to recompense the Prince of Lorrain with another Provostship of equal Value of one of three Bishopricks. And whereas Marsal having been quitted to his Majesty by a particular Treaty, is not at present any part of Lorrain, so it is not to be understood to be compri∣sed in this Restitution. These are the Terms which may, and ought to make the Platform of a General Peace, and upon which his Majesty hath long ago declared himself to the King of Great Britain. His Majesty desires they may be imparted to the Assembly at Nime∣guen; and that his own Plenipotentiaries propose them to the Consideration of the rest, as containing the lowest Conditions he can admit; and upon which his Enemies may make Choice either of War or Peace. Given at St. Germains the 9th of Apr. 1678. The Imperialists, of all others, seemed the least inclinable to yield to the foregoing Conditions; and the Strain of requiring full Satisfaction to Sweden was insupportable to the Northern Princes; yea, the Spaniards and other Confederates looked up∣on them so hard, that they said, They would hazard all rather than accept of them. Tho' after all, those Articles that con∣cerned Holland and Spain having been before privately agreed upon with some Leaders of the principal Towns, they proved the Plan of the Peace both for Holland, and all the other Con∣federates engaged in the War. Yet when the French Embassa∣dors carried these Conditions to Sir Lionel Jenkins, then sole Mediator, in order to be communicated by him to the Confe∣derates, he made Answer, He could not do it as a Mediator, but that he would atquaint the Parties with them in Discourse, as a matter to which he promised no Answer; and this he did, because of the other Terms that had been agreed on between England and Holland, for forcing of France to a Compliance, on the 10th of Jan. foregoing; which, tho' they proved to be of little use in the Course of this Peace, yet they had one good Effect upon the Affairs of Spain, and this was, That notwith∣standing all the French Intriguing in England and Holland, the Fears they had that the King at length might be in earnest, and
punctually perform the Conditions of this League; and well knowing that if it came to that, they should have occasion for all the Force they could make, and perhaps find all little enough, they abandoned Messina, and all their Conquests in Sicily; and that at a time when every body thought the Mareschal de Fevil∣lade had been sent into that Kingdom with fresh Forces upon the Design of some new Enterprize: Whereas, indeed, he went thither to fetch off the French Troops that were there; which he did, after he had first declared to the Senate the King's Or∣ders, and the present Necessity of them; and with whom; a vast Number of the Messines, who dreaded the certain Revenge of the Spaniards, took also the Opportunity to retire. But that the French might stave off the Blow from England,K. Charles II. tempted with Moncy by France. if possible, they at length bethought themselves of a Srrata∣gem, that had more charming Obligations in it, than any other made with the Prince of Orange, when in England, or with the States-General afterwards, and that was, an Offer of Money: For, you must know, Mr. Montague, the King's Embassador at Paris, after a long Conference with M. Louvois, by his Ma∣ster's Orders, wherein the Latter represented to him the Mea∣sures that had been already concerted for a Peace upon the French Terms in Holland; and that since they were agreed there, it was hoped his Britannick Majesty would not be against it; but that however, he had Orders to make him a Tender of a great Sum of Money for his Consent, tho' a thing al∣ready accepted by the Dutch, and wherein his Majesty conse∣quently was not concerned, was desired to give the then Lord Treasurer of England an Account hereof by a Packet; which Offer, tho' very relishing at any time with the Humour of our Court, yet the violent Dispositions of the Dutch to run into the Peace at this time, whatever came of it, and such a fatal and mutual Distrust as there was both in Court and Parlia∣ment, that it was very difficult to fall into any sound Measures between them, made the King look upon it as a very profita∣ble Proposal; saying, That since the Dutch would have a Peace upon the French Terms, and that France offered him Money for his Approbation of that he could not help, he knew no Rea∣son why he might not get the Money, and so required Sir Wil∣liam Temple to treat with the French Embassador about it. But that Gentleman had more Honour and Honesty than to engage in so dishonourable a Thing, and did thereupon retire from Court. You have heard before, that the 10th of May was the time limited by the French Project of Peace, for the Allies to accept of the Terms or no, and to which they appeared posi∣tively engaged; but there being a Necessity of somewhat a greater Confidence between the Dutch and French upon this Occasion, least such a Siffnes might produce that Alteration in the Pace of Affairs at the Expiration of the Term, that might
prove a Disadvantage to one or the other side, the Heer Bever∣ning sent secretly to acquaint the French Embassadors, That the States did accept of the King's Offer. However that he might not by such a Pace allarm the Allies, he gave the Count d' Avaux also notice, That he was very desirous to discourse with him in private, and for that end would fetch a Walk alone upon the Ramparts of the Town about 7 in the Morning, where they met accordingly, and between whom all Matters were in a manner fully concluded: The Consequence there∣of was, the granting of Ten Days longer for the Dutch to en∣deavour to perswade their Allies to accept of the Conditions proposed, as themselves had done. In this time the Estates re∣ceived a Letter from the French King, from his Camp at Deinse, wherein he made some further Concessions, and invited them to send Deputies to him at Ghent. But because the Reader will be better pleased to peruse the Letter it self, I shall here insert it. DEINSE, the 18th of May, 1678. Most dear great Friends, Allies, and Confederates, OVT of the sincere Affection which we have always born to the the promoting the Peace of Europe, we are very much satisfied to understand, by our Plenipotentiaries at Nimeguen, the Account given unto them in your Name, by one of your Ambassadors, con∣cerning your Thoughts upon the Conclusion of so great a Work, which you had imparted to them by one of your Embassadors. We are glad to understand, that the Terms which we proposed at that Assembly appear to you to be reasonable, and that you are fully per∣swaded of the Sincerity of our Mind, in a matter of so great Im∣portance: And it is with the greater Satisfaction to our selves, that we confirm the same unto you by this Letter; that notwithstanding those Advantages which we have already acquir'd by our Arms, and may justly hope for by the Prosecution of the War; yet we place our chiefest Glory in making all the Steps we can towards a Peace. But because it appears by the Discourses that have been made to our Ple∣nipotentiaries by your Order, that how desirous soever you are to con∣clude the Peace, yet there remains some Scruple with you concern∣ing the 7th Article of the Treaty of Commerce, which has been debated at Nimeguen, between our Embassadors and yours; and Trouble of Mind, lest we should make an entire Conquest of the Low-Countries, in case Spain should reject the Terms we have of∣fered, we are willing to impart our Thoughts unto you upon these two Points. We cannot do it more favourably, as to the 1st of them, than by granting, that the 7th Article should be as your selves desire it; and in taking such Measures with you upon the 24 Point, as may ease you of the Fear you express for the Loss of Flan∣ders. And this we will then do, when Spain having refused to
consent to the Peace, there shall be a Treaty concluded between us and you, upon such Terms as have been already propos'd with rela∣tion to your selves, and that you shall have returned to our Alliance, and shall oblige your selves to continue Neuters during the War. We shall be always reddy for your sake to grant to Spain the same Terms, with relation to Flanders, which they are at liberty now to accept: And we are further willing to assure you, that in all that time we will not Attack any one Place in all those Provinces. Thus ye shall always find us reddily inclined, not only to form that Barrier, which you think so necessary for your own Safety, but to secure it; and to let you enjoy, together with the Re-establishment of Com∣merce, whatever other Advantages you can expect from our Friend∣ship. And if for the Prosecuting this Negotiation you shall think it necessary to send Deputies to us, they will find us near Ghent till the 27th of this Month, and in the same Dispositions we have declared to you in this Letter. In the mean time, we pray God to take you, most great dear Friends, Allies, and Confederates, into his Holy Protection. Your good Friend, Ally, and Confederate, LOVIS. Underneath was Signed, Arnauld. The States,The States Answer. after 4 Days Consultation, did, on the 25th of the same Month, send a Letter in Answer to the King's, by a Trumpeter of their own, to his Camp; and after having com∣plimented him upon the Honour he had done them, by writing to them; and rejoiced at the sincere Desire they conceived to be in his Majesty for the Peace of Europe; They pray'd he would be pleased to give Credit to the Heer Van Beverning their Ex∣traordinary Embassador, whom they would send to him, to in∣form him, how desirous they were on their part to give him fresh Assurances of their sincere Intentions also for Peace. Bever∣ning attended upon the French King accordingly, and concerted Measures so well, that he obtained a Cessation of Arms for 6 Weeks in Flanders, to the end the Dutch might endeavour to get the Spaniards to enter into the Peace upon the Terms they proposed for them; which Truce extended it self to the 15th of Aug. following; and, upon his return, he told his Masters, (whether really or designedly is a Question) That he found the French King as well informed of the Condition of his Enemies, and of the Places he might attack, as he was of his own Affairs. England,The Confe∣derates an∣gry with the States. in the mean time, was grown pretty indifferent in the Matter of the Peace, and Spain seemed well inclined to ac∣cept her part of it; But the Emperor, King of Denmark, and Elector of Brandenburg fell into the highest Declarations and Reproaches against the States that could well be invented, rip∣ping
up all they had ventured and suffered in a War, wherein they had engaged for the sole Preservation of Holland: But that now they were abandoned by them, under a Pretence of concluding a Peace, and that upon imperious and arbitrary Terms for them without then Consent; That they were not backward to treat with France, and make a Peace upon any safe and equitable Conditions, but would never endure to have them imposed as from an absolute Conqueror; and would ra∣ther venture and expose all, than accept them, especially those for the Duke of Lorrdin, whose Case was the worst treated, tho' seemingly the most favoured by the Confederates, and the least contested by France. Yet for all these Storms from their Allies, the States were little moved, but held on their Course, ha∣ving little Regard to the Satisfaction of any other than Spain in what concerned the Safety of Flanders, and the Necessities of that Crown made them easie, tho' as little pleased as the rest:The Dutch order their Embassa∣dors to Sign the Peace. Wherefore on June 22. they sent their Embassadors Or∣ders to Sign the Peace with France, before the End of the Month: And the very same Day wrote to the French King by the Sieur Lanoy, one of their Officers, who passed thro' the Camp, and delivered a Letter from them to the Mareschal de Luxemburg, whereby they acquainted him, That they had gi∣ven the foresaid Orders to their Embassadors, at Nimeguen, a∣bout Signing the Peace; and at the same time communicated to him the Sence of the Letter they wrote to his Majesty. But notwithstanding all this Tendency both in Spain and Holland to give the finishing Stroke, yet an unforeseen Accident fell out, which had like to have overturned the whole Fabrick, and re∣new the War with greater Vigour, and more equal Forces, by engaging England in a Share of it, in Favour of the Confede∣rates, which they had been long practising without any Success, and were quite out of Hopes thereof. For in the Conditions which the Dutch had made for the French restoring the 6 Towns,The Peace obstructed. in Flanders, to the Spaniard, there was no particular Mention made of the Time of that Re∣stitution, the Dutch understanding as well as the Spaniards, that it was to be upon the Ratifications of the Peace with Spain and Holland, whether any other of the Allies on each side were in∣cluded or no: And the Negotiation had been managed in that manner till the very Day before the Treaty was to be Signed, without any apparent Thoughts of a clear Explanation of the Points; when the Marquess de les Balbases having either found or made some occasion of enquiring more particularly into the Intentions of France concerning it, bethought himself of an Explanation as to the Time of the Restitution of the said Places; And, in order thereunto, went first to the Dutch Em∣bassadors to sound their Opinions upon that Snbject; who made Answer, That if the French pretended to delay the Restitution
beyond the Exchange of the Ratifications, it was a Thing not meant by them: And thereupon going immediately to the French Embassadors, to give them their Explications, which they would send to the States-General by an xpress; The lat∣ter made no Difficulty of declaring, That the King their Ma∣ster being obliged to see an entire Restitution made to the Swedes of all they had lost in the War, could not evacuate the Towns in Flanders, till those to the Swedes were likewise resto∣red; and that this Detention of Places was the only Means to induce the Princes of the North to accept of the Peace; with∣out demanding, that the same Powers, who only accepted the Conditions of the Peace, That they might, as soon as they could, disingage themselves from the Misfortunes of the War, should engage any other Means for procuring that Satisfaction. The Dutch Embassadors, having received the States Answer here∣upon, did, June 25. declare to those of France, That they could not Sign the Peace, without the King did remit his Pre∣tensions, and evacuate the Towns upon the Ratifications of the Treaty. But the French Embassadors, on the other side, were firm, and said, Their Orders were to insist upon the Satisfacti∣on of the Swedes. This strange Procedure of theirs, made the States send to Monsieur Van Lewen at London, to acquaint the King with it, and to know his Resolution upon so momen∣tous a Point, who was at first hard to believe it, but finding the same confirmed by the French Ambassador, he was surprized, and angry; and thereupon sent Sir William Temple into Holland, with a Commission to Sign a Treaty with the States, by which they should be obliged to carry on the War, and he to enter into it, in case France did not consent, within a certain Time limited, to evacuate the Towns; which Treaty, after he had once fallen into the Negotiation, he concluded happily in the Space of 6 Days; and the Particulars whereof, because I ne∣ver saw them yet in English, and that they may give some Light to this Affair, I shall here insert. HAGUE, July 26. 1678. AS the States-General of the Vnited Provinces,The Treaty of Alliance between England and Holland. after ha∣ving declared by their Letters to the most Christian King, That they consented to the Conditions of Peace, as far as in them lay, which he had offered them; and that his Ca∣tholick Majesty, who was also of the same Sentiment, was wil∣ling on his part, so far as it regarded him, to embrace the same Treaty, and having, upon that Head, used all the Facility that could be; and, to that End, ordered his Embassadors at Nime∣guen to set their Hands to those Conditions, so far as it related to them, as well as the other Allies, who were also willing to be comprehended therein; have nevertheless understood, with
much Concern of Mind, that the Ministers of France have op∣posed the same, and refused the Restitution of the Places which belonged to Spain and the States, without they would first, and for the Satisfaction of Sweden, restore also those Places which had been taken from them during the Course of the War: This so unexpected a Change having obliged the States to believe, That Pretensions so ill grounded were rather an Effect of the Repugnancy that might be in the Plenipotentiaries, than the real Intentions of his Majesty, who had otherwise explained himself; and as the said States did besides inform his Majesty of Great Britain of the Essential Point that obstructed that im∣portant Negotiation, praying him to support so just a Cause, and to endeavour to obtain of his most Christian Majesty all that might remove the Obstacles which retarded that Work; And adding withal, That if his Endeavours should prove fruit∣less in so just a Work; he would be pleased to protect and assist them with all his Forces; and that his Majesty did thereupon re-assure them, that the Peace was neither just nor feasible up∣on those Conditions; and gave them his Promise, That he would defend them, if the most Christian King refused it under any Pretence whatsoever. Upon that the States gave Orders to their Plenipotentiaries, to desire those of France, That with∣out making those exorbitant Demands, or insisting upon Satis∣faction to Sweden, they would forthwith conclude and sign the Treaty; which they were also ready to do in the Name of the States, if his Majesty, after the Ratification and Publishing of the Peace, would give up unto them all those Places, without precending any Restitution to the Swedes of what they had lost since the War. With this View, and in order to prevent those dangerous Consequences that may arise from such Delay, it is agreed be∣tween his Britannick Majesty and the States, That if their Offices and Endeavours do not surmount these Remora's, and if they cannot get the most Christian King to declare before the 11th of Aug. that he will really restore those Places after the Ratification and Publishing of the said Treaty, without any fur∣ther insisting upon these Pretensions of the Swede, by a speedy Evacuation of those that ought to be restored by Virtue of that Peace: It is then agreed, and these Two Powers do agree to declare War against France, and to compel her thereto with their joint Forces, according to the Conditions stipulated un∣derneath, or such as shall be hereafter established between them, or with other Princes who shall enter into this En∣gagement. And as his most Christian Majesty hath often declared to his Britannick Majesty, as a common Mediator between the Parties in Difference, That he would readily embrace a Peace, that could be made upon reasonable Terms, yet his good Offices
and Hopes have not been able to produce the Fruits wished for, through the new Pretensions that have been continually raised. His said Majesty and the States-General, assembled July 26. 1678. believing and being perswaded, that Repose cannot be given to Christendom, if the Princes who are in War should ac∣cept of those Conditions; and if, as to what concerns Spain and France, the latter do not render to the other Charleroy, Aeth, Audenard, Courtray, Tournay, Conde, Valenciennes, St. Gi∣stain, Binch, the Dutchy of Limbourg, &c. with their Bailywicks, Chatellines, Governments, Provostships, Appurtenances and Dependances, so as to restore them, and put them into the Hands of Spain. And as for what concerns the Emperor, the Empire and its Princes, that France shall give up to them all that she has ta∣ken from them at present, and that the rest remain as it was before the War; That Lorrain be restored to the Duke of that Name in the State it is in now; or, if that cannot be done, in the State it was when seized by France; his Majesty and the States mutually and really obliging themselves to the Observa∣tion of this Point. I. His said Majesty and the Lords the States-General, promise to do their utmost; and, if it may be, to use all sorts of Means to constrain the most Christian King to give Satisfaction in these Terms, without being at Liberty to make a Peace with him, if he do not give his Consent to them, or to some others, as shall be agreed on between his Majesty and the States, according to the Success of the War. II. His Majesty and the States-General do engage themselves further for the obliging France to consent to these Conditions, or to such as the Princes concerned shall find convenient; and in short, for bringing of that Crown to comply with it, that his Majesty shall furnish One Third more by Sea, and a Third less by Land, in the Low-Countries, than the Lords the States, all by a Provisionary Way, till it be otherwise provided by the Allies. III. It is also stipulated, That if his Majesty of Great Britain and the most Christian King make War upon one another, one of the Confederates cannot separate from the other by any parti∣cular Treaty, without that other's Consent. IV. But if the Negotiation of the Peace, which is held at Nime∣guen, comes to be broke up, and that the Parties should agree upon any other Place to treat of it, or of a Truce, that cannot be done without the Consent or Agreement of the other Allies;
and without, at the same time, one of the Parties in the Con∣federacy procure also to the other the necessary Pasports to pass freely, and without Danger, to the Place appointed for the Treaty, where he ought also to communicate to him all that passeth in that Negotiation. And, in the mean time, they shall not have Power to consent to any Peace or True, but according to the Conditions stipulated by the 1st Article, or such other as they shall agree upon, and without his Ay be re∣established in the full and entire Possession of all the Lands, Towns, Places, and Immunities, which he enjoyed at the Sign∣ing of this Treaty, in Europe, if it be not otherwise agreed on between his Majesty and the States. V. But if the Peace in Hand terminate happily between the most Christian King on the one Hand, and his Catholick Majesty and the States General on the other, whether by the Propositi∣ons which France hath made her self, or by such other as they can agree to, his Britannick Majesty and the States will not on∣ly be Guarrantee in the best and surest Form that may be; but also, its free for other Kings and neighbouring Princes, who shall have any Interest in the Repose of Christendom, and the immutable Tranquility of the Low-Countries, to be so. 'Tis with this View that his said Majesty and the States would agree upon the Troops and Means that are necessary to bring the Party who shall violate the Peace, to make Satisfaction for the Damages he shall do another any manner of way. VI. These Articles, and the full Contents of them, are to be Signed and Ratified within 3 Weeks, or sooner, if it may be, and the Ratifications exchanged at the same time. Given at the Hague the 26th of July, 1678. Signed, W. Van Henkelom, de Van Wiugaerden Fagel, D. Van Heyden, Van Leewen, J. de Mareg∣nault, Jean Baron de Reed, A. ter Borght. Temple. After the Treaty had been thus concluded and signified to France,Du Cross's Message. all the Artifice that could be, was used on that side to elude it, by drawing the matter into a Treaty, or at least a greater length; which had succeeded so well in England, that they offered to treat upon it at St. Quintin, then at Ghent, where the French King himself proposed to meet such Embassadors as the Dutch should send into either of them Towns. But the States were stanch, not to recede from their late Treaty, and continued in that Mood till about 5 Days before the Ex∣piration of the time; then came one De Cross from England
with a Packet for Sir William Temple, commanding him to go forth with to Nimeguen, and there to endeavour from the King, to perswade the Swedish Embassadors to let the French know, That for the Repose of Christendom, they did not any longer de∣sire the French King to insist upon the Detention of the Towns, and consequently hinder the Peace upon the sole Regard and Interest of the Crown of Sweden; and to assure them, that after the Conclusion of the Peace, the King would employ all his Endeavours, that the Towns and Countries which their Master had lost in the War should be restored unto them. How this Dispatch of Du Cross was gained, was never known; but 'tis sufficient to believe, that France had the greatest Hand in it, since 'twas transacted all one Morning in Portsmouth's Apart∣ment, by the intervention and pursuit of Barillon, the French Embassador. Yet for all this, when Sir William Temple arrived at Nimeguen, which was but 3 Days before the Expirati∣on of the Term fix'd by the late Treaty between our King and the States, either for the French to evacuate the Towns, or for carrying on the War conjointly against France, there was but little Disposition, that the Peace would be Signed; but rather, the quite contrary appeared, by the Stiffness shewed on both sides to adhere firmly to their respective Demands. And the Dutch Embassadors remained peremptory, That there could be no Deputation for the securing of the future Satisfaction of Sweden, as the French demanded before the Term expired, and no other Remedy upon that, but that the War must go on. With this View and Expectation all the Parties seemed to be, when the fatal Day came, wherein either a suddain Peace, or a long and bloody War, was to be reckoned on in Christendom; on the Morning whereof Monsieur Boreel, who had been sent from Amsterdam to the Dutch Embassadors at Nimeguen, went to the French Embassadors, and after some Conference with them, they immediately went to those of Holland, and declared; they had received Orders from their Master to consent to the Evacuation of the Towns, and thereupon to Sign the Peace; but that it must be done that Morning: At this, the Dutch seemed to be surprized, but immediately entred into a Confe∣rence with them thereupon, which lasted for 5 Hours, and ended in an Agreement upon all Points, both of Peace and Com∣merce, between France and Holland. It was certainly thought the French Embassadors had received no Power to Sign the Peace; and 'twas said, Sir William Temple himself did advise those of Holland to press them to it, out of a real Belief, as well as the Hopes he had, they could not indeed do it. But the Length of the Conference did so alarm the Confederates, that they were in a Commotion before it was ended; and yet-more sen∣sibly touched, when they came to know the Peace was concluded on, and that it was to be Signed that very Day. And what gave
them a greater Uneasiness, was, That they ound England now acting in their Favours in the same manner as they had long de∣sired. However, not to be wanting to themselves, th Embas∣sadors of Denmark, Brandenburg, and Munster, that very Day gave in a Protestation to those of the States, wherein they re∣presented, That finding them, the Embassadors of the States-General, inclined that Day to Sign a Separate Treaty of Peace with the French King, by the Confession now even of one of themselves, tho' they had given them no Intimations whereof, as they should have done according to their Treaties; they were obliged to lay before them, how disagreeable this man∣ner of Procedure was to the Solemn Alliances the Staes had contracted with their Masters, wherein they had engaged never to enter into a Separate Treaty with their Common Enemy, who was ready to destroy their Republick; and from whose Hand they could never have escaped, had it not been for their Assistances, and the Diversion they had given his Arms in seve∣ral parts of Europe in their Favour; They conjured them by all that was solemn and engaging, not to precipitate the Treaty, but to give them leasure to acquaint their Principals with it, which could be no Prejudice to either Party; That they could not but promise themselves so much at their Hands, especially since there was no apparent Necessity to oblige their High and Mightinesses to Resolutions so contrary to all that had been concerted before, after they had exhorted their Allies afresh to the Observation and Execution of their Treaties, and after that their Masters had taken vigorous Resolutions thereupon, and agreeable to the Desires of the States, in sending vast numbers of Troops into the Spanish Netherlands, for the Re∣lief of Mons, which by the Arms of France was reduced to Ex∣tremity; and for seconding and putting in Execution other Designs which Spain and the States should resolve upon, under the Conduct of his Highness the Prince of Orange, for the com∣mon Security of the Low-Countries in particular. To say no∣thing of the great Bodies that were on their March towards the Meuse, to be employed to the same purpose, from whence, with the Assistance of God, there was room to hope for a good Success in so just a Cause. But that in case the Lords the States found themselves under an indispensible Necessity, which yet did not appear to them, of proceeding with so much Precipi∣tation to a particular Peace with France, they did declare here∣by, That their Masters were ready at the same time to enter upon the said Treaty, and, in Conjunction with the States, to conclude the same with the French King upon just and equitable Conditions, which in a short time might be agreed, and where∣unto they on their part, would shew all the Facility imagina∣ble: That they could not but promise to themselves the Com∣pliance of the States, in this particular; and that they could
not think they had entertained the least Design of abandoning their good and faithful Friends, Neighbours, and Allies, who had hazarded all that was dear unto them, to deliver them from the impending Storm wherewith they had been threatned, and for their re-establishment in their ancient Splendor and Liber∣ty; at leastwise they hoped for so much from their Justice and Sincerity, that they would conclude upon nothing, without com∣prehending the Interest of their Allies, which was in a manner their own in it; and not concur in the Oppression and Ruine of those, who had faithfully assisted them against so powerful an Enemy, who with one Hand made all the Semblance imagi∣nable of the sincere Desire he had to give Repose to Christen∣dom, but with the other, refused to accept the Means that were proper to effect it. They added further, That such an hasty and precipitate Conduct in them was unworthy of a State that had always governed it self with Reason and Justice; and that such an extraordinary Step would be an everlasting Blot upon the Honour and Reputation of the States-General. But that if, notwithstanding all, they were resolved to proceed, and en∣ter into a Neutrality so contrary to their Solemn Engagements, they protested against that Separate Treaty in the best Form they could; and not only so, but also against all the Calamities that Christendom in general, and the Princes their Masters in particular, might suffer by that Separation. But notwithstanding the Reasonableness and Solemnity of this Protestation, and the Irresolution of Monsieur Van Haren, one of the Dutch Plenipotentiaries, who did not seem to be so clear in the Point of their Orders; yet Directions were presently given to have all-fair writ over with the greatest haste imaginable; so as the Treaty might be Signed that Night; which was done accordingly between 11 and 12,The Peace between France and Holland Signed. without the Intervention of the English Mediators, who refused to Sign the same, or to have their Names made use of as such, saying, Their Instru∣ctions were to mediate a General Peace; and therefore, by their Orders; could not Sign a Particular One. The Treaty fol∣lows. NIMEGUEN, Aug. 10. 1678.

Rolleduc beyond the Maes, together with the Villages of Re∣demption, Banc d' St. Servais, and whatever is belonging to the said Town. IX. The said Lords the States-General promise, That whatever concerns the Exercise of the Roman Catholick Religion, and such as profess it, enjoying their Goods, shall be re-established and maintained in the said Town of Maestricht and its Depen∣dances, in the same State; and in such Manner as was regulated by the Capitulation made in the Year 1632, and that such as shall have been endowed with any Ecclesiastical Goods, Canons Places, Parsonages, Provostships, and other Benefices, shall continue settled in them, and enjoy them without any Con∣tradiction.

XIII.
The said Lords the States-General have, and do promise, not only to maintain a perfect Neutrality, without being at Liberty to assist directly or indirectly the Enemies of France, or its Allies; but also to guarrant all such Engagements as Spain shall enter into, by the Treaty that is to be betwixt their most Christian and Catholick Majesties, and especially that, whereby the Ca∣tholick King shall be held to the same Neutrality.

AS in pursuance of the War, which for some Years has hap∣pened betwixt the most Christian King, and the States-General of the Vnited-Provinces, of the Low-Countries, his Ma∣jesty caused to be seized all Things belonging to the Prince of Orange, as well the Principality of Orange, as other his Lands and Seignories, lying in France, and granted the Revenues thereof to Monsieur the Comte d' Auvergne, who enjoys the same at present; and since, by the Grace of God, a Peace is settled by the Treaty, this Day concluded, and so all the angry Effects of War ought to cease, his Majesty hath promised to the said Prince, and doth promise by this separate Act, that immediately after the Ratifications exchanged, his Majesty will take off the said Seisure, and cause the said Prince to be resto∣red to the Possession of the said Principality, and of the Lands which belong to him in France, Franche Comte, Charleroy, Flan∣ders, and other Countries depending upon his Majesty's Rule, and to all his Rights, Actions, Privileges, Usages, and Prero∣gatives, in such Estate and Manner as he enjoyed the same, till he was dispossess'd by reason of the present War. Nimeguen, Aug. 10. in the Year of our Lord, 1678. Marshal D'Estrades. Colbert. De Mesmes. H. Beverning. W. de Nassaw. W. Haren.
WE well liking the separate Article aforesaid, in all and and every Point thereof, have by these Presents Sign∣ed with our Hand, allowed, approved, and ratified, and do allow, approve, and ratifie the same; promising upon the Faith and Word of a King, to fulfil, observe, and cause to be observed the same, truly and faithfully, without suffering any Thing to be acted, directly or indirectly, to the Contrary there∣of, for any Cause, or upon any Occasion whatsoever. In wit∣ness whereof we have Signed these Presents with Our Hand, and have caused Our Seal to be put therto. Given at St. Germain, in Laye, Aug. 18. in the Year of Grace, 1678. and of our Reign the 36th. Signed Lewis, By the King. And underneath, Arnauld. The Day after the Signing of this Peace, came over the Ra∣tification of the late Treaty between the King and States, with Orders to Sir Will. Temple, to proceed forthwith to see the Exchange of them, which he did accordingly; tho' after the Counter-pace made by the Dispatch sent by De Cross, and the Consequences of it, the same seemed now as unnecessary as it had been at first unresolved at the English Court, and unexpected by the Dutch, who many of them now were as unsatisfied with the Peace, and especially with the Precipitation of Monsieur Beverning to Sign it upon the sudden Offer of the French Mini∣sters to evacuate the Towns, and before he had acquainted the States with it, and received new Orders thereupon; as the ge∣nerality of that Nation were weary of the War; but the Thing was done, and after some Contestation, the City of Amsterdam declaring her Approbation of it, the rest of the Provinces came soon to acquiesce also in the same.The Battle of Mons. But while these Matters were transacted in the Cabinet, there was a Work of another nature undertaken in the Field, Mons had been straitly Blocked up for some time by the French Army, under the Command of the Duke of Luxemburg, who was so confident of the good Po∣sture he was in, that he sent the Mareschal d' Estrades, one of the French Plenipotentiaries at Nimeguen, word, He was so Posted, that if he had but 10000 Men, and the Prince of Orange 40000, yet he was sure he could not be Forced, whereas he took his Army to be stronger than that of the Prince: But the Prince for all that, and in spight of many Disadvantages from an Army drawn so suddenly together, so hasty a March as that of the Dutch, and Posts taken with so much Force, and Fortified with so much In∣dustry, did upon Sunday the 17th of Aug. in the Morning, De∣campt with his own and the Confederate Armies from Soignes, marched towards Roches, and from thence resolved to advance
towards the Enemy, whose Right Wing was Posted at the Abby of St. Dennis, and the Left at Mamoy St. Pierre with such ad∣vantage of Situation, that they were almost thought unaccessi∣ble; for, besides the Woods there was only a Precipice led to them, and that by narrow Paths. About 12 the Cannon began to play upon St. Dennis, and the Prince went to Dinner in the open Field, just as the Duke of Monmouth arrived in the Camp; when Dinner was ended, the Battalions under the direction of Count Waldeck began to act on the side of the Abby, and about 3 in the Afternoon made their Attack, the Prince himself being there present, and that with extraordinary Bravery, all the Regiments of his Left Wing seconding one another in excellent Order. In the mean time the Spanish Troops under the Com∣mand of the Duke de Villa Hermosa, acted on the side of Chasteau, being assisted by the Prince's Guards, who had the Van, and the English and Scots Troops, Commanded by the brave Earl of Ossory. The Action lasted from 3 in the Afternoon till 9 at Night, during which, the Prince rid toward Chasteau, where the Dispute was likewise very sharp, the Guards behaving themselves with extraordinary Vigour, and the Earl of Ossory with his Troops doing Wonders: The Prince himself was Ingaged among the foremost of the French, who on such an occasion were not well to be distinguished from the Confederate Troops, and Mon∣sieur Overkirk shot a French Commander, who attackt his High∣ness. At last, after a great Slaughter on both sides, the Con∣federates remained Masters of St. Dennis Abby, having thought fit to quit the Post at Chasteau, by reason of the great difficulty they found to second their Attacks on that side. The Duke of Luxemburg finding how things went on his side, thought fit to Retire in the Night, leaving his Dead, many Wounded, his Tents, &c. behind him; and the Prince next Morning went to view the Camp the Enemy had Abandoned, taking up his Quar∣ters at the Abby of St. Dennis, where the Duke of Luxemburg had had his the Day before; But Advice of Signing of the Peace coming to the Prince next Morning from the States, hindred the prosecution of this Advantage, which very probably might have been as much Glorious to him in the Consequence, as it was Honourable at the present, according to the Confession of a brave Enemy that was in the Battle, who said, That he esteemed this the only Heroick Action that had been done in the whole Course or Progress of the War. The Prince sent to give the Duke of Luxemburg notice of the Peace, who thereupon desired an Interview with him, which was agreed to; and all things past with great Civilities on both sides, the French crowding about a Young Prince that had made so much noise in the World, and but the Day before given Life and Vigour to such a desperate Action, as all Men esteemed this Battle of St. Dennis to be; yet many Reflections were made
upon it both by his Friends and Enemies; some saying, That he knew the Peace was Signed before the Fight began, (but that, if it were true, could not Prejudice him, since he was not obliged to take notice of it, till he received Advice from the States,) and that it was too great a venture both to himself, and the States, and too great a Sacrifice to his own Honour, since it could be to no other Advantage; others laid the blame upon the Marquess de Grana; That he had Intercepted or Concealed the States Packet to the Prince; but this was an uncertain Report: However, the Prince could not have ended the War with greater Glory, and with more spight to see such a mighty occasion wrested out of his Hands by the sudden and unexpected Signing of the Peace, which he had assured himself the States would not have consented to without the Spaniards. But the Business was done, and therefore he left the Army, went first to the Hague, then to Dieren to Hunt, as having little else to do; leaving the States at liberty to pur∣sue their own paces, as to the finishing of the Treaty between France and Spain; wherein their Embassadors at Nimeguen im∣ployed themselves with great Zeal and Application, and no longer as Parties and Confederates, but rather as Mediators, the English declining that Function, as being a Matter wherein our Court would take no part. The Northern Confederates were still mightily chafed at the Dutch Proceedings, and tho' with all their Remonstrances, they were not able to stave off the Separate Peace of Holland, yet they imployed their last Effort now to prevent the Spaniards agreeing to that part of the Peace, as accepted for them by the Dutch, and to that end exclaimed mightily against their Breach of Honour and Inter∣est, citing the very Articles of their Treaty with them for it; and said, That what was left the Spaniards in Flanders, by those Terms, was Indefensible, and would serve but to exhaust their Men and Treasure to no purpose. That France had no other Design than to break the present Confederacy by such Separate Treaties, and so leave the Spaniards abandoned by all their Al∣lies upon the next occasion, which they could no less than expect, if Spain should use them with as little regard of their Honour and Treaties, as the Dutch Embassadors seemed to design; these and especially some difficulties that did arise on the part of France about giving up the Country of Beaumont, and the Town of Bovines to the Spaniards, as being Matters not men∣tioned in the Dutch Treaty with the French, upon the Score of Spain, before the Peace was Signed, made Matters very doubt∣ful and uncertain, whether the Dutch would Ratifie their Trea∣ty, or the Spaniards Sign theirs. Whilst Mens minds were bu∣sied with various Conjectures and Presages upon the present Conjuncture, about the middle of Aug. Mr. Hide was suddenly dispatcht over from England, to the surprize even of all in Holland, and more especially of our Embassador there, who had
not the least Intimation of it; and if the Journey was surpriing, the Message was no less, which is included in the following Memorial. That his Majesty having understood,Mr. Hyde's Memorial to the States. that a Separate Treaty of Peace had been Concluded, and Signed between the Most Christian King's Embassadors, and those of this State, he was extreamly surprized at the Manner of the Procedure of the the States Embassadors at Nimeguen, and having seriously re∣flected thereon, he hath commanded my Lord Embassador to hasten hither with all expedition, in order to represent the same to the Lords the States, that his Majesty cannot find there is any Declaration, or Promise made by the Most Christian King, for the Evacuating the Towns upon the Ratification of the Peace Signed at Nimeguen. That in the next place, there is no Article between the Most Christian King's Embassadors, and those of this State, to assure the said Evacuation. Thirdly, That France has retarded the said Evacuation by the new Proposals she has made to the Spaniards, whereof, there were no mention made in their own Propositions, which had been accepted by Spain, particularly, by a Detention of some Places, till Dinant were yielded up by the Empire, and by keeping the County of Beaumont, and Bovines, with other Places, of which there had been no mention made in the said Proposals. And as it has been agreed upon in the last Treaty, which was concluded and ratified between his Majesty and this State, that in case his Most Christian Majesty did retard, or retract from the said Evacuation, whether upon account of procuring Satisfaction to the Swede, or for any other Cause whatsoever, that the King and this State were obliged to enter into a Con∣joint War against France; his Majesty does believe, that the Substance of that Treaty is come to pass by the fore-mention∣ed Conditions, and that his Majesty, and this State were e∣qually obliged to pursue the said Treaty, and to give the said Embassador Orders to demand of this State the Executi∣on of it. And as his Majesty does not at all doubt, but this State has the same Sentiments with himself, in respect to the Mutual Obligation that lies upon them from the said Treaty; he has commanded the said Embassador in his Name, and on his part, to assure them, that if the Lords the States, will refuse to Ra∣tifie that which was Signed by their Embassadors at Nimeguen, his Majesty 3 Days after such a Declaration shall be notified to him, on the part of this State, will declare actual War against France, and punctually put in Execution all the Contents of his last Treaty with this State.
And his Majesty having taken into Consideration those Re∣presentations which have been made unto him, on the part of this State, concerning a Neutrality for Cleve and Juliers, his Majesty is so sensible of the great Danger that may befal this State, without a sufficient Barrier on that side, as well as on that of Flanders, that he has commanded the said Embassador, to assure the Lords the States, that he is ready to Concert with them; and enter upon all the Measures that can be taken for their Security on that side, as well as on the other, and that it shall be their Fault, if they obtain not such Se∣curity. When the Prince of Orange was made acquainted with this Procedure of England, by Mr. Hyde, who went on purpose to Hounslerdike to do it, he was no sooner withdrawn, but the Prince lift up his Hands two or three times, and said to Sir Wil∣liam Temple,Prince of O∣range's Cen∣sure of the English Court. then present, Was ever any Thing so Hot, and so Cold, as this Court of yours? Will the King that is so often at Sea ever learn a Word that I shall never forget, since my last Passage; When in a great Storm, the Captain was crying out to the Man at the Helm all Night, Steddy, Steddy, Steddy? If this Dispatch had come 20 Days ago, it would have changed the Face of all Things in Christendom, and the War might have been carried on till France had Yielded to the Treaty of the Pyrenees, and left the World in Quiet for the rest of our Lives; but it is my Opinion, as it comes now, it will have no Effect. And, indeed, the Event proved answerable to the Prince's Judgment:Articles a∣gainst Mons. Beverning. Its true, all Ap∣pearances for the present, seemed very different from both the Proceedings of the Dutch and Spaniards too, whereof many of the Deputies of the former appear'd so ill satisfied with their Embassadors having Signed the Peace, that they inclined to the King's Proposals, and framed severral Articles against Monsieur Beverning's Proceedings, the five Principal whereof were these; First, That in the Preface, the French King seemed to be the Protector of the States. Secondly, That the Neutrality to which the States-General were engaged by that Treaty, was indefi∣nite, and by consequence might be extended beyond the pre∣sent War, Thirdly, That he had exceeded his Commission, in having obliged the States to warrant the Neutrality of Spain. Fourthly, That he had omitted an Article of Amnesty and Oblivion, which ought mutually to be stipulated in all Trea∣ties of Peace. And Lastly, That he had forgot to mention the Barrier, which the French King granted to Spain, in Con∣sideration, and for the Security of the States-General: As for the Embassadors of the latter, notwithstanding, the French af∣ter several Debates and Conferences, did demit in their Pre∣tentions, yet they raised new Scruples about the Castellany of Aeth, and other Things; their Confederates upon the Conti∣nent, and the daily Transportation of English Forces into Flan∣ders,
heightning their Stiffness, as well as the Expectation they had of the States going on again with the War upon this new Turn of Things. But after Matters had continued for about 3 Weeks in this uncertain State, France thought the Conjun∣cture of too much Importance to let it hover so long; and therefore, first dispatch a Courier to their Embassadors at Ni∣meguen, with leave to satisfie the States as to those Clauses in their Treaty, wherein they seem'd justly to except against Be∣verning's Conduct; And therefore, to cover the Credit of that Minister, who had been so affectionate an Instrument in the Progress of it; and so gradually softning their Rigour, as to the remaining Points contested by the Spaniards, they at last dispatch'd a Courier, who brought Letters to Nimeguen on the 8th of Sept. impowering their Embassadors to remit all the Dif∣ferences that obstructed, or retarded the Conclusion of the Treaty between that Crown and Spain, to the Determination and Arbitrage of the States themselves; which was a piece of Confidence towards them, on the part of France, that several Towns and Provinces proceeded with a general Concurrence to their Ratifications, that they might lie ready in their Em∣bassador's Hands, to be exchanged when the Treaty with Spain was Signed, which was done on the 17th, at the Dutch Embas∣sadors House, and wherein Sir Lionel Jenkins, the Kings Me∣diator, had no part; and so the Designs of the Court of Eng∣land were once more Eluded, and Mr. Hyde had the Mortifica∣tion to return re infecta. This Treaty with Spain is very long, and for that Reason, I had Thoughts once to leave it quite out, but considering the Treatise would have been imperfect without it; and that a much better Estimate may be made by it, of the present Po∣sture of the Spanish Affairs, upon the late Peace, than other∣wise could be done, I have altered my Mind, and given my Reader the Particulars. The TREATY of PEACE, betwixt France and Spain, Concluded at Nimeguen, Sept. 17. 1678. IN the Name of God the Creator, and of the most Holy Trinity; To all present, and to come, be it known, That whereas during the Course of the War, that arose some Years since betwixt the most High, most Excellent, and most Mighty Prince, Lewis XIV, by the Grace of God, most Christian King, of France and Navar, and his Allies, on the one part; and the most High, most Excellent, and most Mighty Prince Charles II, by the Grace of God, Catholick King of Spain, and his Allies on the other part; their Majesties have desired nothing more ve∣hemently, than to see it end in a good Peace; And whereas the
same desire to put a Stop as far as in them lay, to the Ruine of so many Provinces, the Tears of so much People, and the shed∣ding so much Christian Blood, hath induced them to comply, with the powerful Offices of the most High, most Excellent, and most Mighty Prince, the King of Great Britain, to send their Embassadors Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiaries, to the Town of Nimeguen; So it is come to pass through an Effect of the Divine Goodness, that hath been pleased to make use of the intire Confidence, that their Majesties have always reposed in the Mediation of the said King of Great Britain, that at length the said Embassadors Extraordinary, and Plenipotentia∣ries; to wit, on the behalf of his most Christian Majesty, the Sieur Count D' Estrades, Marshal of France, and Knight of his Majesty's Orders; the Sieur Colbert, Knight, Marquess of Croissy, Councellor in Ordinary in his Council of State; and the Sieur De Mesmes, Knight, Count De Avaux, Councellor also in his Majesty's Councils; and on the behalf of his Catholick Majesty, the Sieur Don Pablo Spinola Doria, Marquess de les Balbases, Duke of Sesto, Lord of Gminossa, Casalnosetta, and Pon∣teucrone, Councellor in his Council of State, and chief Proto∣notary in his Council of Italy; Don Gaspard de Tebes, and Cor∣dova Tello; Guzman Count de Venazuza, Marquess de la Fuente, Lord of Lerena, of the House of Arrucas, of the Isles of Guada∣lupa, and Matalione, Perpetual Master de la Victoire, Perpetual Major, and Recorder of the Town of Sevil, Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber to his Imperial Majesty, one of his chief Council of War, and General of his Artillery; Don Pedro Ronquillo, Knight of the Order of Alcantara, Councellor in his Council of Castile, and of the Indies; and Don John Baptisse Christin, Knight, Councellor in the high Council of Flanders, near to his said Catholick Majesty's Person, and one of his Council of State, and of his Privy-Council in the Low-Countries; by Vir∣tue of Letters, and Commissions, which they have communica∣ted to one another, and the Copies whereof are Word for Word inserted at the End of this Treaty, have come to an A∣greement and Conclusion, upon mutual Condition of Peace, and Friendship, in manner following, viz. I. It is Covenanted and Agreed, that from henceforth, there shall be a good, firm and lasting Peace, Confederation and per∣petual Alliance, and Friendship, between the Most Christian and Catholick King, their Children born, to be born, their Heirs, Successors, and Inheritors, their Kingdoms, Estates, Countries, and Subjects, so that they shall love one another, as good Brethren, procuring with all their might one another's Good, Honour, and Reputation, and faithfully preventing, as far as they shall be able, one another's Damage.
II. In pursuance of this good Re-union, the Cessation of all man∣ner of Hostilities, agreed on, and Signed, the 19th Day of Aug. of this present Year, shall continue according to the Tenour thereof, betwixt the said Kings, their Subjects, and Vassals, as well by Sea and other Waters, as by Land, and generally in all places where the War is carried on by their Majesties Arms, as well between their Troops and Armies, as between the Garri∣sons of their several places; and if any Contravention shall have happened to be committed, contrary to the said Cessation, by taking of any Place or Places, whether by Attack or Surprize, or by private Intelligence, nay, though Prisoners shall have been taken, or other Acts of Hostility committed through some ac∣cident that could not be foreseen, or by such Persons as could not foresee it, contrary to the said Cessation of Hostilities, such Contravention shall faithfully be repaired on both sides, without delay or difficulty, by restoring to the full, whatever shall have been taken, and delivering the Prisoners without Ransom or paying of Charges, in such way that all things be restored, in such manner, to the same condition they were in, on the said 19th Day of Aug. when the said Cessation was agreed, and Signed, the Tenour whereof shall be observed till the Day of the Exchange of the Ratification of this present Treaty. III. All Causes of enmity, or misunderstanding, shall remain for ever extinct, and abolished, and whatever hath happened or been done, by reason of the present War, or during the same, shall be put into perpetual oblivion, so as for the future no in∣quiry shall be made into the same on either side, directly or in∣directly, by Law, or otherwise, under any pretence whatsoever; nor may their Majesties, or their Subjects, Servants, and Ad∣herents on either side, express any manner of resentment, of whatever offences, may have been committed against them, or dammages received by them, during the present War. IV. In contemplation of the Peace, the Most Christian King im∣mediately after the Exchange of the Ratifications of this present Treaty, shall put into the Catholick King's Power, the Place and Fortress of Charleroy, the Town of Binche, the Town and Fortresses of Aeth, Oudernard, and Courtray, with their Provost∣ships, and Castellanies, Appurtenances, and Dependancies, in the same manner as his Catholick Majesty possess'd them before the War of the Year 1667. All which Towns and Places, the Catholick King yielded to the said Most Christian King at the Treaty Signed at Aix la Chappelle, the 2d of May, 1668. from which this present Treaty doth expresly derogate, for so much as relates to the said Towns and Places, their Appurtenances and Dependances. In pursuance whereof, the said Catholick
King shall take Possession of the same, and enjoy them to him and his Successors, fully and peaceably, excepting the Verge of Menin, and the Town of Conde, which tho' heretofore pre∣tended to by the Most Christian King, to be a Member of the Castellany of Aeth, shall nevertheless remain to the Crown of France, together with all its Dependances, by Virtue of this pre∣sent Treaty, as shall be said hereafter. V. The said Most Christian King obligeth himself, and promiseth to put likewise into the Hands of the said Catholick King, im∣mdiately upon the said Exchange of the Ratifications, the City and Dutchy of Limburg, together with all its Dependances, the Country of Ontremeuse, the City and Cittadel of Ghent, with all its Dependances; likewise the Fort of Rodenbus, and the County of Waes, the Town and Place of Leuve in Brabant, to∣gether with its Dependances; the Town and Place of St. Ghilain, whose Fortifications nevertheless shall be rased; and the own of Pucierda in Catalonia, in the Condition it now is, with their Countries, Places, Castles, Forts, Lands, Lordships, Demesns, Bailiffwicks, Appurtenances, Dependances and Annexations, without reserving or detaining any thing therein, to be posses∣sed by his Catholick Majesty and his Successors, in the same man∣ner he enjoyed them before the present War. VI. The said Places, Towns, and Places of Charleroy, Binch, Aeth, Oudernard and Courtray, their Bailifwicks, Castellanies, Govern∣ments, Provostships, Territories, Demesns, Lordships, Appur∣tenances and Dependances, and all thereunto annexed, by what Name soever called, with all the Men, Vassals, Subjects, Towns, Boroughs, Villages, Hamlets, Forests, Rivers, Champain Coun∣tries, and all other things whatsoever thereunto belonging, shall remain, by Virtue of this present Treaty of Peace, to his Ca∣tholick Majesty, his Heirs, Successors and Assigns, irrecoverably, and for ever, together with the same Rights of Sovereignty, Propriety, Regalities, Guardianship, and Jurisdiction, Nomi∣nation, Prerogatives and Preheminencies over the Bishopricks, Cathedral Churches and Abbies, Priories, Dignities, Curacies, and all other Benefices whatsoever, situate within the said Coun∣tries, Places, and Bailiffwicks so yielded up, to whatsoever Abbies the said Priories do appertain and belong, and all other Rights that heretofore belonged to the Most Christian King, though not particularly here expressed; so as his Catholick Majesty shall not be troubled or molested for the future, by any means whatsoever, in Right or in Deed, by the said Most Christian King, his Successors, or any Princes of his Family, or by any other, or upon any Pretence or Occasion that may happen, in the said Sovereignty, Propriety, Jurisdiction, Appeal, Possession and Enjoyment of all the said Countries, Towns, Places, Castles
Lands and Lordships, Provostships, Demesnes, Castellanies, and Bailiffwicks, together with all the Places and other Things there∣on depending. And to this end, the said Most Christian King, as well for himself, as for his Heirs, Successors and Assigns, doth renounce, quit-claim, yield and transfer, as his said Plenipoten∣tiaries, in his Name, by this present irrevocable Treaty of Peace, have renounced, quit-claimed, yielded and transferred, perpe∣tually and for ever, in favour and to the behoof of the said Ca∣tholick King, his Heirs, Successors, and Assigns, all the Rights, Actions and Pretensions, Rights of Regality, Patronage, Guar∣dianship, Jurisdiction, Nomination, Prerogatives and Prehemi∣nences over the Bishopricks, Cathedral-Churches, and all other Benefices whatsoever, situate within the said Places and Bailiff∣wicks so yielded up, to whatsoever Abbies the said Priories did appertain and belong, and generally without any reservation or with-holding, all other Rights whatsoever, that the said Most Christian King, his Heirs and Successors, have and challenge, or may have and challenge, for any Cause, or Reason whatso∣ever, over the said Countries, Places, Castles, Forts, Lands, Lordships, Demesnes, Castellanies, and Bailiffwicks, and over all Places thereon depending, as hath been said, notwithstanding any Laws, Customs and Constitutions to the contrary, notwith∣standing, though confirm'd by Oath. From all which, and from the derogating Clauses, of derogating Clauses, it is expresly derogated by this present Treaty, in order to the said Renun∣ciations and Cessions, which shall be valid, and take place, with∣out that the Particular expressing, or specification of any one, shall derogate from the General, nor the General from Parti∣cular, and excluding for ever all Exceptions, upon what Rights, Titles, Causes or Pretences whatsoever grounded. And the said Most Christian King declareth, consenteth, willeth and inten∣deth, That the Men, Vassals, and Subjects of the said Countries, Towns and Lands yielded to the Crown of Spain, as aforesaid, shall be, and remain discharg'd and absolv'd, from this time forward, and for ever, from the Faith, Homages, Services and Oaths of Allegiance, that they may have made to himself, or the Most Christian Kings, his Predecessors, as also from all Obedience, Subjection and Vassalage, which they owe him by reason thereof; it being the Intention of the said Most Christian King, that the said Faith, Homages and Oaths of Allegiance, shall be void, and of no force, as fully, as if they never had been made or taken. VII. The said Most Christian King shall also cause to be restor'd to the said Catholick King, all the Towns, Places, Forts, Castles and Posts, that have, or may have been seized by his Arms, in whatsoever Parts of the World, to the Day of the Publication of the Peace. And in like manner, his Catholick Majesty shall
cause to be restor'd to his Most Christian Majesty, whatever Places, Forts, Castles and Posts, may have been seized by his Arms, during the present War, in any Parts of the World, un∣to the Day of the Publication of the Peace. VIII. The Restitution of the said Places, as aforesaid, shall be made by the Most Christian King, or his Ministers, Really and Truly, without any Delay or Difficulty, for any Cause, or upon any Occasion whatsoever, to him or them that shall be deputed by the Catholick King, in Time and Manner aforesaid, in the Con∣dition they now are, without Demolishing, Weakening, Di∣minishing or Endammaging the ame in any sort; and without pretending to, or demanding any re-imbursement, for fortifying the said Places, or for paying what might be due to the Sol∣diers, and People of War there. IX. It is further agreed, That all Proceedings, Judgments and Sentences, given and made by the Judges, and other the Officers of his Most Christian Majesty, in such Towns and Places as his Majesty enjoy'd, by Virtue of the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle, and quitted, as above, to his Catholick Majesty, or by the Par∣liament of Tournay, by reason of Controversies and Suits at Law, prosecuted as well by the Inhabitants of the said Towns, and their Dependances, as by others, during the Time they were under the Obedience of the said Most Christian King, shall take place, and be of as full Force and Effect, as if the said King continu'd Master, and actually possess'd of the said Towns and Countries: Nor shall the said Judgments and Sen∣tences be called in question, or annull'd, nor the Execution thereof be otherwise retarded or hindred; nevertheless, it shall be lawful for the Parties to seek Relief, by Review of the Cause and Course of Law, and Order prescrib'd by the Statutes, yet so as the Judgments shall in the mean time remain in full Force and Virtue, though without Prejudice to what is stipulated in that respect, in the 21th Article of this present Treaty. X. Whereas his Most Christian Majesty's Ministers, after the Peace of Aix la Chapelle, maintain'd at the Conference at Lisle, That the Sluces, both on the West and East-side of the Town of Newport, and the Fort Vierboet, at the end of the Western Sluce, near the Mouth of Newport-Haven, and one part of the Fort of Nieuven Dam, built upon the Eastern Sluce, with the Piers of the said Haven, being kept in Repair by those of Furnes; were within the Territory and Jurisdiction of the Castellany of Furnes, and that consequently they belonged to his Most Chri∣stian Majesty: And his Catholick Majesty's Ministers held the contrary, that they did not; and whether they did or did not, that it ought to suffice, that since the said Fortifications were
made, as well with respect to the Castellany of Furnes, as to the Town of Newport, his Catholick Majesty, being a Sovereign Prince, might Incorporate, and Appropriate the said Parts thereof, to the Haven and Fortifications of Newport, and by that means make them inseparable from that Town. It is a∣greed, That the said Sluces, and other Parts of the Fortificati∣ons of Newport above-mentioned, shall remain to his Catholick Majesty, as well as the Town it self, without any Pretensions ever to be made to the same, by his Most Christian Majesty, by reason of the Town and Castellany of Furnes being his, or otherwise. And for the Draining of the Waters of the Castel∣lany of Furnes, it shall be continued, and his Catholick Majesty shall enjoy the same, in Manner and Form, as hath been used till now. XI. The said most Christian King shall retain, continue seized of, and actually enjoy, the whole County of Burgundy, commonly called the Franche Comte, and the Towns, Places, and Coun∣tries thereto belonging; together with the Town of Bezacon, and the Liberties thereof, and the Towns of Valenciennes, and its Dependancies, Bouchain, and its Dependances, Conde, and its Dependances, though heretofore pretended to be a Mem∣ber of the Castellany of Aeth, Cambray, Cambresis, Air, St. Omer, and their Dependances, Ipre, and its Castellany, Warwick, and Warneton upon the Lys, Poperinghen, Bailleul and Cassel, with their Dependances, Bavay and Maubeuge, with their Depen∣dances. XII. The said County of Burgundy, the Towns, Places, and Coun∣tries thereto belonging, together with the Town of Bezancon, and the Liberties thereof, as also the said Towns and Places of Valenciennes, Bouchain, Conde, Cambray, Aire, St. Omer, Ipres, Warwik and Warneton, Poperinghen, Baileul, Cassal, Bavay and Maubeuge, their Bailiffwicks, Castellanies, Governments, Pro∣vostships and Territories, Demesnes, Lordships, Appurtenan∣ces, Dependances, and all thereunto annexed, by what Names soever called, with all the Men, Vassals, Subjects, Towns, Bo∣roughs, Villages, Hamlets, Forests, Rivers, Plain-Countries, Salt-Pits, and all other Things whatsoever thereunto belonging, shall remain, by Virtue of the said present Treaty of Peace, to his Most Christian Majesty, his Heirs, Successors and Assignes, irrecoverably and for ever, with the same Rights of Sovereign∣ty, Propriety, Regality, Patronage, Guardianship and Juris∣diction, Nomination, Prerogative and Preheminence over Bi∣shopricks, Cathedral-Churches, and other Abbies, Priories, Dignities, Curacies, and all other Benefices whatsoever, with∣in the Compass of the said Countries, Places and Bailiffwicks so yielded up, of what Abbies soever the said Priories hold Lands,
and have dependance upon, and all other Rights, that hereto∣fore belonged to the Catholick King, though not here particu∣larly expressed: So that his Most Christian Majesty, shall not in time to come be Troubled or Molested, by any means whatso∣ever, in Right or in Deed, by the said Catholick King, or his Successors, or any the Princes of his Family, or by any other, or for any Cause or Pretence, with Relation to the said Sovereign∣ty, Propriety and Jurisdiction, Appeal, Possession and Enjoy∣ment of all the said Countries, Towns and Places, Castles, Lands and Lordships, Provostships, Demesnes, Castellanies and Bailiff∣wicks of the said Places, and of all Things whatsoever there∣unto belonging. And to this end, the said Catholick King, for himself, his Heirs, Successors and Assignes, doth renounce, quit∣claim, yield up, and transfer, as his said Plenipotentiaries in his Name, by this present irrevocable Treaty of Peace, have re∣nounced, given up, and for ever transferr'd in favour of the Most Christian King, his Heirs, Successors and Assignes, all the Rights, Actions, Pretensions, Rights of Royalty, Patronage, Guardianship, Jurisdiction, Nomination, Prerogatives and Pre∣heminences over Bishopricks, Cathedral Churches, and all other Benefices, within the compass of the said Places, Countries and Baliffwicks yielded up, of what Abbies soever the said Priories held Lands, and had dependance upon, and in general, without any reservation or with-holding; all other Rights that the said Catholick King, his Heirs and Successors, have and challenge, or may have and challenge, for any cause or upon any occasion whatsoever, over the said Countries, Places, Castles, Forts, Lands, Lordships, Demesnes, Castellanies and Bayliffwicks, and over all Places thereunto belonging, as aforesaid, any Laws, Customs, or Constitutions, to the contrary, notwithstanding, tho' confirmed by Oath. From all which, and all derogating Clauses of Derogatories, it is expresly derogated by this pre∣sent Treaty, in order to the said Renunciations, and Sessions, which shall be valid and take place, without any derogation from a general Clause, by a particular Specification, or from a particular, by a general one; and for ever excluding all Ex∣ceptions, on what Rights, Titles, Cause, or Pretence soever grounded: And the said Catholick King, declareth, consenteth, willeth, and intendeth, That the Men, Vassals, and Subjects of the said Countries, Towns, and Lands yielded to the Crown of France, as aforesaid, shall be, and remain discharged, and ab∣solved henceforward, and for ever, from the Faith, Hommage, Service, and Oath of Allegiance, that all, and every of them may have taken or made to himself, or to the Catholick King's Predecessors, together with all Obedience, Subjection and Vassalage, that are owing to him by reason thereof; it being the Intention of the said Catholick King, that the said Faith, Hommages, and Oaths of Allegiance, shall b
void, and of no force, as if they never had been taken, or made. XIII. And whereas his Most Christian Majesty hath declared by the Conditions of Peace, which he offered, that he was willing to restore the Town of Charlemont, or in lieu thereof, that of Dinant, at his Catholick Majesty's Choice, upon Condition that his said Catholick Majesty would charge himself to obtain from the Bishop of Liege, the Cession of Dinant, and that the Empe∣ror and Empire should consent thereunto, his Catholick Majesty has chosen to retain the Town of Charlemont, as heretofore, and consequently doth oblige himself, and promise to obtain from the Lord Bishop and Chapter of Liege, an Authentick Cession of the said Town of Dinant, and the Emperor and Empire's assent within a Year to be computed from the Day of the Date of the Ratification of the Treaty of Peace, which shall be betwixt the Emperor, and the Most Christian King. And in case his said Catholick Majesty shall not be able to obtain the said Cessions of the Bishop and Chapter of Liege, and Emperor and Empire's assent, he obligeth himself, and promiseth, after the Expiration of the said Term, to cause the said Town of Charlemont to be put into his Most Christian Majesty's Power, for him to enjoy the same, in like manner as he shall enjoy all other Places and Countries, yielded to the said Most Chri∣stian King, by the 11th and 12th Articles of this present Treaty. XIV. And for the Preventing all such Difficulties, as the Borders caused in the Execution of the Treaties of Aix la Chapelle, and the Re-establishing for ever a good Intelligence between the Two Crowns, it is agreed, That the Lands, Boroughs and Villages, reduced within the Provostships that are yielded, or that belong to his Most Christian Majesty, before this present Treaty, or are on the other side of the Sambre, shall be ex∣changed for others nearer to the Places, for his Catholick Ma∣jesty's Convenience: And likewise, that the Villages of the Verge of Menin, situated too near Courtray, shall be changed for others nearer, for his Most Christian Majesty's Conveni∣ence; And likewise, that such Villages of the Provostship of Mons, as are so far up in the Country, quitted to his Most Christian Majesty in Hanault, that intercept Communication, shall be exchanged for others, belonging to the Countries quit∣ted to his Most Christian Majesty, that are nearer, for the Con∣venience of his Catholick Majesty; and generally that all Lands inclosed within Countries, yielded or restored to either of the said Kings, shall be exchanged for others of equal value, pro∣vided, that such Exchanges can be agreed upon.
XV. Commissioners shall be deputed on both sides 2 Months after the Publication of the present Treaty, who shall assemble where it shall be respectively agreed, as well to proceed to make the said Exchanges, as to settle the Bounds between such Estates, and Lordships, as must remain to each of the said Kings in the Low-Countries, by Virtue of this present Treaty; as also to clear the real Debts, lawfully secured by the Lands and Lordships, yielded or restored to either of the Two Crowns, and to settle how much each shall pay for the future, and in general to make an amicable End of all Differences that may arise in the Execution of the present Treaty. XVI. If any such Difficulties should arise in the Exchanges afore∣said, as may hinder their taking Effect, no Custom-Houses shall be appointed on either side to perplex one another, and to ren∣der the Communication more difficult, betwixt Places under the same Dominion, and such as shall be settled, shall exact no Duties, but of such Merchandizes, as shall be conveyed from one Dominion to another, to be consum'd there, or to be car∣ried to Places remote. XVII. The said King's giving back, and restoring respectively the Places afore-mentioned, may cause to be taken, and carried away all manner of Artillery, Powder, Bullets, Arms, Provisi∣on, and other Warlike Ammunitions that shall be found in the said Places at the time of their Restitution; and such as they shall appoint for that Purpose, may for 2 Months make use of the Waggons, and Boats of the Country; and shall have a free Passage by Water and Land, to carry away the said Ammuni∣tions; And the Governours, and Commanders, Officers, and Magistrates of the several Places, and Countries, shall give them all the Facilities they can, for the Carriage, and Con∣veying away the said Artillery, and Ammunition. Also the Officers, Souldiers▪ and others that shall leave the said Places, may take thence, and carry away their moveable Goods▪ but without exacting any thing from the Inhabitants of the said Places, and of the Plain-Country, or endamaging their ouses, or taking away any Thing whatsoever, belonging to the said Inhabitants. XVIII. The Levying of Contributions demanded on both sides, in Countries now subjected thereunto, shall continue for all that shall become due, to the 16th of Octob. next, and the Arrears that shall remain due, at the time of the Ratification afore∣said, shall be paid within 3 Months after the Expiration of the said Term; and no Execution shall issue in the mean time against the Communion indebted, provided they give good
and solvent Bail, of Persons residing in some Town, within that King's Dominions, to whom such Contributions shall be due. XIX. It is also agreed, that the Most Christian King's Reception of the Profits, whereof he is in possession, within all the Coun∣tries that he gives back, and restores to the said Catholick King, shall continue to the Day of the actual Restitution of the Places, to which such Countries do belong, and what shall remain due at the time of the said Restitution, shall be truly paid to the Farmers; and also that within such time, the Pro∣prietors of Woods confiscated within the Dependences of the Places, that are to be restored to his Catholick Majesty, shall return to the Possession of their Estates, and of all the Wood that shall be found upon the Place; provided, that from the Day of Signing this present Treaty, all cutting of Wood shall cease on both sides. XX. All Papers, Letters, and Writings concerning the Countries, Lands, and Lordships, that are yielded, and restored to the said Kings by this present Treaty of Peace, shall be truly pro∣duced, and delivered on both sides, within 3 Months after the Ratifications of the present Treaty, shall have been exchanged, in what place soever such Papers and Writings are, even those that were taken out of the Cittadel of Gendt, and out of the Chamber of Accounts at Liste. XXI. All Subjects on both sides, as well Ecclesiastical as Secular, shall be settled in the Enjoyment as well of such Honours, Dig∣nities, and Benefices, as they were provided of before the War, as of all and singular their Goods, movable and immovable E∣states for Life, and Mortgages, seized and possessed since the said time, whether by reason of the War, or for siding with the other Party; together with all Rights, Actions, and Inheri∣tances fallen to them, even since the War began, but not so as to demand, or pretend to the mean Profits and Revenues, ac∣crued and grown due, since the Seizure of such immovable Goods, Rents, and Benefices, and before the Day of the Pub∣lication of this present Treaty. XXII. Nor likewise to such Debts, Effects and Movables, as shall have been confiscated before that Day; so as neither the Creditors of such Debts, or Depositaries of such Effects, their Heirs, nor Assigns, may sue for, or pretend to recover them. Which Re∣establishments in manner aforesaid, shall be extended in favour of those that have taken the contrary part, so as to restore them by means of this present Treaty, to the Favour of their King and Sovereign Prince, and the Possession of such of their
Goods, as shall be found in being, at the Conclusion and Sign∣ing of this present Treaty. XXIII. And such Re-establishment of the Subjects on both sides, ac∣cording to the Contents of the 21th and 22th Articles, shall take Effect, notwithstanding any Gifts, Grants, Declarations, Confiscations, Forfeitures, Sentences preparatory or definitive, given for Contumacy, in absence of the Parties, or without hearing them; all which Sentences and Judgments shall be void and of none effect, as if they had not been given, or pronoun∣ced, and the Parties at liberty, to return to the Countries from whence they departed, personally to enjoy their immovable Goods, Rents, and Revenues; or to settle their Aboads else∣where, wehre they will themselves, at their own Choice and E∣lection, without being under any Constraint in that respect; and if they shall chuse rather to live elsewhere, they may depute and appoint such unsuspected Persons as they shall think fit, for the Disposition and Enjoyment of their Goods, Rents and Re∣venues; but not with relation to Benefices requiring Residence, which must be served and administred in Person. XXIV. Such as have been provided on either side, of Benefices, which were at the Collation, Presentation, or other Disposition of the said Kings or others, whether Ecclesiasticks or Laicks, or have Provisions from the Pope of any Benefices, within the Obedience of either of the said Kings, by whose Consent and Allowance they have enjoyed the same during the War, shall continue in the Possession and Enjoyment of such Benefices for their Lives, as well and duly thereof provided; but without any future Prejudice, to the Rights of the lawful Collators, who shall enjoy, and use the same as they did before the War. XXV. All Prelates, Abbots, Priors, and other Ecclesiastical Persons, that before or during the War, have by the said Kings been nominated to Benefices, or provided thereof, which their Ma∣jesties were in Possession of a Power to provide, or nominate, be∣fore the Breach between the two Crowns, shall be maintained in the Possession and Enjoyment of such Benefices, without Di∣sturbance, for any Cause, or upon any Pretence whatsoever. And also in the free Enjoyment of all such Goods, as shall be found to have anciently belonged thereunto, and of the Right of Collating to the Benefices thereunto belonging, wheresoever such Goods and Benefices are situated. Provided always, that such Benefices be supplied with Persons able and quality'd, ac∣cording to the Rules observ'd before this War. So that here∣after, no Administrators shall be sent on either side to govern the said Benefices, and receive the Profits thereof; which shall not be enjoyed but by Titularies, lawfully provided. And also
all such Places, as heretofore acknowledged the Jurisdiction of the said Prelates, Abbots and Priors, wheresoever situated, shall acknowledge the same for the future, if their Right ap∣pear to have been anciently settled, although the said Places should fall out to be within the Extent of the other Princes Do∣minion, or depend upon some Castellanies, or Bayliffwicks, be∣longing to the other Party. XXVI. It is Agreed and Declared, That no part of the Pyrenean Treaty is hereby intended to be revoked; but what concern Portugal, with which the Catholick King is now at Peace, nor any part of the Treaty of Aix la Chappelle, but for so much as shall be otherwise disposed in this present Treaty, by the yield∣ing up of the Places aforesaid; so as the Parties shall neither ac∣quire any new Right, nor incur any Prejudice to their respective Pretensions, to any thing not expresly mentioned in this present Treaty; and consequently, whatever was stipulated by the Pyrenean Treaty, concerning the Interest of the Duke of Savoy, and the Power of the late most Serene Infanta Catherina, shall be observed, without any hurt or prejudice by this particular Clause, to the general Stipulation in this present Article, con∣cerning the Performance of the said Pyrenean Treaty, and that of Aix la Chappelle. XXVII. Though their most Christian and Catholick Majesties con∣tribute all their Cares towards the setling a General Peace, and that so fair a Way towards it, as that of a General Truce, gives them Hopes, that a Conclusion of whatever may secure the Quiet of Christendom, will speedily ensue; yet since the said most Christian King doth insist upon it, that the Catholick King shall oblige himself, not to assist any of the Princes, that are now engag'd in War against France, and its Allies, his Catholick Majesty hath promised, and doth promise, to observe a perfect Neutrality, during the Course of this War, without being at Liberty to assist his Allies, directly or indirectly, against France, or its Allies. XXVIII. And whereas their most Christian and Catholick Majesties, do acknowledge the powerful Offices which the King of Great Bri∣tain has contributed without intermission, by his Counsels and good Advertisements, toward the Publick Safety and Repose; it is agreed on both sides, That his said Majesty of Great Britain, and his Kingdoms, shall be expresly comprehended in this pre∣sent Treaty, after the best Form that can be. XXIX. Within this Peace, Alliance and Friendship, on the part of his most Christian Majesty, besides the King of Sweden, toge∣ther with the Duke of Holstein, the Bishop of Strusburg, and
Prince William of Furstemburg, as concern'd in the present War, shall be comprehended, if they please themselves, all those, that having refused to engage or declare themselves in this present War, shall be nominated within 6 Months after the Exchange of the Ratifications. XXX. And on the one part of his Catholick Majesty, shall likewise be comprehended, if themselves please, all such as having for∣born to engage or declare themselves in the present War, shall be nominated, within 6 Months after the Exchange of the Ra∣tifications, and all others, that after the said War ended, shall likewise be nominated by his said Catholick Majesty. XXXI. The said most Christian and Catholick Kings do agree, That all Potentates and Princes, that shall be willing to enter into the like Obligation, may give their Majesties their Promises and Engagements of Warranty, as to the Execution of whatever is contain'd in this present Treaty. XXXII. And for the greater Security of this Treaty of Peace, and of all the Points and Articles therein contained, the said present Treaty shall be published, attested and registred in the Court of the Parliament of Paris, and in all other Parliaments of the Kingdom of France, and in the Chamber of Accounts at Paris. And also the said Treaty shall be published, attested and regi∣stred, as well in the Great, and other Councils and Chambers of Account, of the said Catholick King, in the Low-Countries, as in the other Councils of the Crowns of Castile and ragon, according to the Form contained in the Pyrenean Treaty, of the Year 1659. of which Publications and Enrollment, Exemplifi∣cations shall be delivered on both sides, within 3 Months after the Publication of this present Treaty. All which Points and Articles, above expressed, and the Con∣tents of every of them, have been Treated, Agreed, Passed and Stipulated, between the said Embassadors Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiaries of the said most Christian and Catholick Kings; which Plenipotentiaries, by Virtue of their Powers, the Copies whereof are inserted at the bottom of this present Treaty, have promised, and do promise, under the Obligation of all and every the Goods and Estates, present and to come, of the Kings their Masters, that they shall inviolably be observed and fulfilled, and that they will cause them to be ratified firmly and simply, without addition of any thing thereunto, and to produce the Ratifications thereof, by Letters Authentick and Sealed, wherein all this present Treaty shall be inserted verba∣tim, within 6 Weeks, to be accompted from the Day of the Date of this present Treaty, or sooner if possible. And the
said Plenipotentiaries have promised, and do promise, in their said Kings Names, that after the producing the said Letters of Ratifications, the said Most Christian King, as soon as possibly he can, shall in the Presence of such Person or Persons, as the Catholick King shall be pleased to depute, swear solemnly upon the Cross, the Gospel, and Canons of the Mass, and upon his Honour, fully, really and truly, to observe and fulfil all the Articles contained in this present Treaty: And the like shall be done, as soon as possible, by the said Catholick King, in the Presence of such Person or Persons, as the said Most Christian King shall be pleased to depute. In witness or all which, the said Plenipotentiaries have subscribed this present Treaty with their own Names, and have caused their Seals of Arms to be set thereto. Nimeguen, the 17th of Sept. 1678.

Thus you see France was left in Possession of the Peace with Holland; and Spain, and consequently Master of that of the Em∣pire, and of the North upon her own Terms; and England left to busie it self about that Popish Fire, that was breaking out at home; the Stream whereof, the Court perhaps designed to have diverted by a Foreign War, in Conjunction with the Con∣federates against France, on which they were now as eagerly bent, as they seemed at any time before indifferent thereunto; however, of this we shall say nothing at present, but prosecute, in as concise a manner, as we can, the remaining Paces that were made, together with the interening Accidents that hap∣pened, for putting an End to the rest of the War. After te Peace with Spain was Signed, and that with Holland Ratified, tho' the Embassadors of the Emperor at Nimeguen were sullen, and those of Denmark,The Confe∣rences re∣newed. and Brandenburg enraged; yet by the Application of the Dutch Embassadors, the Conferences were set on foot between them and the French. But how enraged soever the Northern Confederates seemed to be, they were now more inclined than ever, to consent to a Truce, tho' to this, the Swedes would not absolutely agree. For Pomerania, they would willingly accept it, because they had reason to fear that the great Losses they had there sustained, might be follow∣ed by more considerable ones; but they were not for it in Scho∣men, where their Affairs were in a better Posture, by their ta∣king of Christianstadt, which at last after much Difficulty they diadmade themselves Masters of. However, the Losses they sustained in Pomerania were of far greater Concern to them,
than all they pretended to gain elsewhere: And notwithstand∣ing the Death of the Bishop of Munster, was a Mortification to the Confederates, yet Denmark, and Brandenburg go on vigo∣rously with their Preparations against the Isle of Rugen; and the Elector embarking his Forces on several Ships,Rugen ta∣ken. and being himself present at their landing; he managed his Matters with such a prudent and happy Conduct, that in less than a Days space, he rendered himself Master of the whole Island; and without losing time, went and laid Siege to Stralsond, which af∣ter 2 Days Battery he got surrendred up to him. But the French Forces having marched into the County of Juliers, and possest themselves of Aix la Chapelle, undoubtedly lessened the Conforts of the Elector's Success in the North; where we leave him at present, and observe, that the great Preparations the French made to attack the Empire, under Pretence of forcing them to conform to the Terms of the Peace, did so alarm the Princes of the Rhine, that the Electors of Mentz and Triers, with the Duke of Neuburg, sent away in great haste to the States, to desire they might be included by them in the Peace they had made, by Virtue of an Article therein, which gave them Liberty within 6 Weeks to declare, and include such as they should name for their Allies: But this was opposed by France, and refused to any particular Prince of the Empire, and allowed only to the Emperor and the Empire, if they should joyntly desire to be declared, and included in the Peace; tho' the Dutch assured them, that the Emperor himself would e're long, accept of the Peace, and insisted upon it as a Matter that was just, and con∣formable to the Article of their Treaty. About the same time, the Duke of Lorrai seeing all Things go to wreck, and that every one minded his own particular interest, accepted his part of the Peace, as France had carved it out for him, and chose that Alternative offered by that Crown, whereby Nancy was to remain to France, tho' this afterwards came to nothing. The Treaty between the Emperor and France, was still in agitation, tho' it went but slowly on; the main Difference be∣ing about the free Passage of the French Troops through the Empire, whenever they sound it necessary for the Execution of the Treaties of Westphalia; But for the Spaniards who would still act in Concert with the Emperor, and therefore, let not only he Term expire for the Ratification of their late Treaty with France, and even the Prolongation of it agreed to by that Crown, they were at length moved out of their slow pace, by the Outcries and Calamities of their Subjects in Flanders, which suffered such cruel Ravages from the French Troops in this time, that it was a question whether the Spanish Netherlands were not more ruined between the Signing of the Peace, and the Exchange of the Ratifications, than they had been in so much time during the whole Course of the War; and the Rati∣fications
came from Spain about the beginning of Dec. but were not exchanged till the 15th, the last Term given by France. There were divers other Difficulties started between the Em∣pire and France, in the Course of this Negotiation, which spun out the greatest part of the Winter; one, the Affairs of the House of Funstemburg, the Emperor insisting, those Princes should by their Submissions crave Pardon of him, and make him publick Satisfaction, for having espoused contrary Interests; and another, France would have the Result of the Diet of Ra∣tishone, mentioned in the Treaty; by which it might appear, that the Embassadors of the Empire were sufficiently Autho∣rized to stipulate in the Name of the Empire; but at last, when all Things seemed to have been agreed on, the Embassadors on both sides fell into such Heats, and Contests about the Right of the Dutchy of Bouillon, the only Point now in Controversie, that the Conference ended in a total Rupture, and with so much Animosity on both sides, that those who formerly desired the Peace had cause to fear the Treaty would hardly be set on foot again: This made the Embassadors of Denmark and Branden∣burg, nick the Opportunity that Evening, which was Feb. st. about Eleven a Clock, to make a long and smart Remonstrance to the Imperial Embassadors, without taking any notice of the Rupture;Denmark. and Bran∣denburg's Remon∣strance to the Impe∣rial Embas∣sadors. That their Proceedings with the common Enemy, so much the more alarmed them, as that in the Place where they were shut up▪ they could not come as much as to the Speech of them; that they might represent to them how sensibly they were affected to see they made such Mysteries of that, which the Enemy scrupled not to make publick; That they intreated them to consider the Faith of their Leagues, the Decrees of the Empire, and the Injuries they would do to the Princes, their Masters, if they restored Sweden to the Benefit of the Treaties of Westphalia, contrary to the solemn Conclusions that declared they had forfeited the same; hat above all, they desired them to give away nothing that belonged to them; and not to suffer under the Name of a Peace, that the War might be carried in∣to those Parts of the Empire, unto which the Enemies Forces were never yet able to advance. Adding withal, that if, the Imperialists abandoned them to the Discretion of their Enemies, they must not take it in ill part, if they made use of their own Misfortunes for obtaining some Reparation from those who would sacrifice them, and their Interest in that manner; and in fine, adjuring them, by the Majesty of the Sacred Roman Em∣pire, that they would conclude nothing contrary to the Rights of their Masters, seeing they were ready on their Part to make Peace conjointly with them upon equitable Conditions, or otherwise, to take all necessary Measures for a vigorous Re∣sistance.
But notwithstanding all this Remonstrance, and the Season∣ableness of the Conjuncture, the Zeal and Conduct of Sir Lionel Jenkins, the English Mediator, brought Matters so to bear, that the next Day, which was the 2d. of the Month, the Conferences were renewed again; And the Pope's Nuncio, who all a∣long had been covertly very active to accommodate the Dif∣ferences of the Catholick Princes, and particularly, in the pre∣sent Negotiation, fearing least this single Difficulty might ob∣struct the Fruit of so long, and tedious a Work, bestirred him∣self so much, and brought Matters to that pass, that the Sieurs Charun and Vomderveck, Envoys from the Prince and Chapter of Liege, declared; That since nothing but the Pretension, which their Master had to the Dutchy of Bouillon, obstructed the Peace, they consented, that upon the Account of that par∣ticular Interest, the Welfare and Repose of the Empire should be no longer retarded; So that now all Things were adjusted, and in the same Conference, which lasted till Midnight, the Embassadors agreed to Sign the Peace,The Imperi∣al and French Embassa∣dors agree to Sign the Peace. which was done on the 5th, without the English Mediators, whom the Imperial Embas∣sadors would by no means allow to Sign first; and therefore they declined doing it at all, unless as Mediators, in which Case they ought to have the Precedency: And, tho' a French Gen∣tleman is pleased to droll upon Sir William Temple hereupon, saying, He said true, when he protested a long time before, that he would never Sign the Peace, whilst the Affairs of France were in such a Condition,; as to have it Concluded to the Advantage of that Crown; yet it is so far from being any Dishonour to that brave Man, that it is the greatest Eulogium that could be given him, since he has discovered there in the Affection he had for the pub∣lick Tranquility of Europe, as well as for the Honour and Safety of his own Native Country. I shall not recite the last menti∣oned Treaty at large, but content my self to give an Abstract of it only, which follows: I. THAT there shall be a firm and lasting Peace,The Ab∣stract of the Imperial Articles of Peace. between the Empire and France, and an Oblivion of all in∣juries. II. That the Peace of Munster, be the Basis and Foundation of the present Treaty. III. That France renounce all Pretensions to Phillipsburg; and the Emperor on his Part, was to do the like by Friburg, and its Dependances. IV. That France was to have a free and easie Passage at all times, from Brisac to Friburg, and the Provisions for the last Place go unmolested and untaxed. V. Commissioners, in a Year after the Treaty, were to deter∣mine what Dobts Friburg was to pay.
VI. The French King was to restore to the Emperor, the Writings found in Friburg, at the Time of taking of it; but, as for such as concerned the Town, &c. the fore-mentioned Com∣missioners were to agree upon a Place where to keep them. VII. That all who were minded to depart from Friburg with∣in a Year after the Ratification of the Treaty, might freely do it, and either retain or dispose of their Goods at Pleasure. VIII. Agreed however, that Friburg and its Dependences shall be restored to the Emperor, for a satisfactory Equi∣valent. IX. The Duke of Lorrain to be restored to the Possession of his Dominions, in the same State as in 1670, when taken by France. X. That Nancy, &c. be for ever incorporated with France, and the Duke to renounce all Right to it. XI. That for the Conveniency of the French Troops, there be 4 Roads of half a League broad, marked out by Commissio∣ners, for the March of them to their Garrisons in Alsatia, Bur∣gundy, &c. XII. That all Villages, Lands, &c. lying within the said Ways, do remain to France, and no further. XIII. That the City and Provostship of Longuicer, remain forever to France; and that the Duke, his Heirs, &c. do lay no Claim thereunto. XIV. In Compensation for Nancy, France was to give up the City of Thoul, &c. to the Duke, with the same Sovereignty over it as France had; with a Promise in the next Article of further Satisfaction to the Duke, in case that were not a sufficient e∣quivalent. XV. The French King did renounce the Right of Presentati∣on of a Bishop of Thoul, into the Hands of the Pope, to whom the Duke was to apply himself, for obtaining it. XVI. All benefited Persons, put in by the King, to continue in quiet Possession of their Livings. XVII. All Proceedings at Law, Decrees, &c. finish'd in the Time of the French King's Possession of Lorrain and Bar, to take place. XVIII. The Charters, Deeds, &c. in the Exchequer of Nancy and Bar, to be forthwith restored to the Duke. XIX. That Prince Egon, of Furstemburg, his Brother Prince William, and Nephew Prince Antony, their Officers, &c. should be restored to their former State, Dignities, &c. and Prince William forthwith, upon the Ratification of the Treaty, to be set at Liberty. XX. All Vassals, Subjects, &c. of either Party, to be resto∣red to their Honours, Benefices, Goods, &c. as before the War; with all Rights fallen to them during it, and no notice taken what Party, whether of this or that Prince, they have taken.
XXI. The Duke of Holstein Gottorp to be comprehended in the present Treaty; That each Party shall imploy all their. Of∣fices, towards terminating the War, between Sweden, Den∣mark, Brandenburg, &c. and the French to keep Garrison in Cha∣stelet, Hiy, Aix la Chapelle, &c. till the same be accomplished. XXII. That the Evacuation of Places be within a Month af∣ter the Ratification of the Treaty. XXIII. That the Duke of Bouillon continue in Possession of the Dutchy and Castle of that ame; and all Differences con∣cerning them, to be composed within 3 Months after the Ratification. XXIV. All Acts of Hostilities to cease within 14 Days after Signing of the Treaty. XXV. Contributions to be levied till the Ratification, and the Arrears paid (tho' not forcibly demanded) within 4 Months after. XXVI. What had been stipulated concerning Montferat, and the Duke of Savoy, in the Treaty of Munster, should be more particularly valid here. The rest being meer Matter of Form, I proceed to shew that the Danish and Brandenburg Embassadors were no sooner in∣formed, that all Things were agreed on, between the Emperor and France; but the very next Day, which was the 3d of Feb. that they might not upon any account be wanting to themselves, and to omit nothing that might have any semblance, if not ad∣vantage, yet of resentment, made their Protestations against it, and complained that the Emperor's Embassadors had con∣sented to Matters which so nearly concerned the Princes their Masters, that they had not only neglected all their Interests, but also, that they had given their Enemies Liberty to pursue the War even into the Heart of their own Country; That they had Treated about the Rights of all the States of the Empire, so far as to abolish some Decrees concerning them, without the Knowledge of the Princes who were most interested therein: And, in a Word, they Solemnly insisted against that Separate Peace, which ought to be reckoned null, and no way prejudi∣cial to their Leagues, nor to the Decrees of the Empire. And that no Formalities might be omitted, which they judged ne∣cessary for maintaining the Pretensions of their Masters, they did also on the 4th, make a Conditional Protestation against the Peace made by the Emperor and France: They said, That they could the less be perswaded that the Imperial Embassadors could do such a Wrong to the Princes their Masters; for that Sweden had been Treated, during the War, as a State and Member of the Empire, guilty of breaking the Publick Peace, and in that Notion, cited and condemned by the Empire in the usual Form: So that in what manner soever the Emperor might
reconcile himself to that Crown, they had Reason to Protest a∣gainst the Validity of that Peace, and at the same Time, for all the Damages their Masters might suffer thereby. The same Thing was done by the Ministers and Plenipotentiaries of the Princes of Brunswick-Lunemburg, against those two Treaties in the same Terms; not knowing, perhaps, that the Princes their Masters were concluding their particular Peace at Home with France and Sweden, whilst they complained so loudly at Nimeguen, against that of the Emperor. However, that of the Emperor and France was Signed the next Day, as before noted; as was the Peace between the Emperor and Sweden two Days after. The Danish Embassador was so enraged at this Peace, that he scrupled not the Day after to express his Discontent publickly at the House of the Mareschal de Estrades, saying, and several times repeating the same▪ That if the French King pleased, he had suf∣ficient Authority to conclude a League with him, and to get it ra∣tified by his Danish Majesty, who would oblige himself to make War against the Emperor in what Manner, and for as long a Time as his most Christian Majesty should desire him. But this Heat blow∣ing over, and finding there was no reliance upon the Disputes that happened, and Doubts that did arise between the Imperial and French Embassadors, between the Signing and Ratifying the Treaty, so as to hinder the Effect of the latter, they began to think of another Way: Wherefore M. de Meyekron, the Danish Envoy at the Hague, had, upon a View and Foresight how Things were like to go, some Time since, made some di∣stant Overtures to the French Minister there, for an Accomo∣dation; but now he seemed to quicken his Pace, and to appear very willing to have managed a Negotiation with the Count d' Avaux; yet the Offers were still so general, that they gave but little Ground for a positive Answer; at leastwise, the French Embassador would have it so; And therefore, he made Answer in the same Manner, as the other French Embassadors had done at Nimeguen, that in order to a more favourable Hearing, the King of Denmark must begin, by releasing the Swedish Soldiers, who, since the Time they were Shipwrack'd upon the Isle of Barnholm, were not only detained Prisoners, contrary to the Priviledges of the Passports which they had, but likewise ex∣posed to Violence which they daily suffered, on Design to make them engage in the Danish Service, or at leastwise forsake that of Sweden; That the King of Denmark should by so doing purge himself of that Shipwrack, which the French King was never∣theless inclined to attribute rather to Chance, and the mistake of the Pilots, than any premeditated Design; but that, in the mean time, the Inhumane Manner of detaining and using those Forces, could not but be thought very strange. The Duke of Brandenburg also; on his part, being willing to neglect nothing
that might procure him the desired Satisfaction, had sometime since got leave for Mr, Meinders his Envoy to go into France, to what could be done on that side, to bring things to an ami∣cable Composure, and somewhat in his Favour: But finding Matters did not answer his Expectation, he now endeavours to imbroil the Affairs of the Empire in the Treaty with France and Sweden; by Virtue only of the Conclusion of the Diet at Ratisbon, 13th May, 1677, The Embassador of Brandenburg pro∣duced a Copy of it at Nimeguen, with a new Protestation; al∣ledging, That that Conclusion of the Empire was not conform to the Sense that was put upon it in the 36th Article of the Em∣peror's Treaty with France, and in the 12th of that of the Em∣peror's with Sweden; and that the Imperial Embassadors were so far from having by that means any sufficient Authority to Treat in the Name of the whole Empire; that on the contrary, the Emperor himself was thereby required to conclude nothing at Nimeguen, without first submitting the same to the Delibe∣ration of the Diet; and that the Embassadors of his Imperial Majesty, by adding in these Articles, That all, or any Protesta∣tions that might be made in the Empire against that Peace, were to be void and of none effect, had in so doing, committed the greatest Violation, and manifestly contravented the Golden Bull, the Imperial Capitulations, Constitutions of the Empire, and the very Treaties of Westphalia, on which they now pretended to settle the Peace of the Empire. But this did no good nei∣ther; yet the Disappointment thereof was nothing near so sur∣prizing to the Elector, as the French King, by his Embassadors declaring, on the 24th of Feb. to Sir Lionel Jenkins the English Mediator▪ That if within the Month of March, the King of Denmark and Elector of Brandenburg, did not give full Satis∣faction to Sweden, his Majesty should be free then to demand new Conditions; which would be, That Leipstadt should be re∣stored to the Elector of Cologne, and that both those Princes should pay to his Majesty all the Charges of the War; and that at a time too, when his Arms had been very successful, as having just then forced the Swedish Troops to quit Prusia, and with Precipitation to retreat into Livonia, much harrassed with Sick∣nesses and long Marches, as well as Losses in several Skirmishes with Parties of the Elector's Forces, which made the demanded Restitutions for Sweden, still the harder to go down with the Elector and his Ally, the King of Denmark: And partly from these Considerations most of the Powers at Nimeguen, and even the Mediators themselves openly declared, That the entire Restitution of all that the Swedes had lost during the War, would be an insuperable Obstacle to the Peace. To this it was further added, That it was not to be expected that Sweden would make too much haste to put an end to the War, since the 800000 Crowns Subsidy, which that King had allowed him by
France, were better to him than the Revenues of Pomerania, and all that he possess'd in Germany; and that if the French King did not by his Interest and Authority make the Peace of Sweden, that Crown would never make the least Advance towards it, especially so long as it was so well supported by the Men and Money of France. Insomuch, that the Mediator and the Em∣bassadors of all the other Princes who had made Peace, percei∣ving that the Month of March, which the French King had set as the longest Delay to the Elector of Brandenburg, was drilled on in Debates and Disputes, in Writing, without any serious Application to the promoting of the Peace; They could think of no better Expedient for the present, than to procure a Ces∣sation of Arms during all the following Month, not doubting but in that time, all the Difficulties which obstructed the Con∣clusion of the General Peace, might be removed. This Mo∣tion was agreed to by the French, provided the Embassadors of Denmark and Brandenburg accepted of it without Delay: To which they said, It was neither the Fault of them nor their Allies, that that Truce was not granted at the Time that they Signed the Peace with the Emperor, according to the Offers that were then made them. But another Circumstance added by the French Embassadors to their Declaration, viz. Of the Instances which, they said, were made to them by the Bishop of Gurk, one of the Imperial Embassadors, in the Name of the Embassadors of Denmark and Brandenburg for a Suspension of Arms, made these two latter think themselves so sensibly touched in their Honour, that they took a great deal of Pains to make the contrary appear, affirming, They had never either desired or rejected the Cessation of Arms; but nevertheless, that they might remit nothing that might have any probability of tending to promote the Peace, they accepted the Truce upon such Conditions as should, on both sides, be agreed on. At length this Procedure, and some little Contests, ended in Sign∣ing a Treaty of Truce the last Day of March at Nimeguen, to continue to the 1st of May. The Truce being thus Signed, instead of advancing the Ne∣gotiation, did on the contrary stop the Course thereof, during the whole Time it lasted, because the French Embassadors stick∣ing immoveable to their Declarations; there was no more to be said, so that the two Princes who remained still in the War, thought it more adviseable to Negotiate the Peace in France, and gave their Envoys Mr. Meinder, and Mr. de Mayerkron, (the last whereof had Orders to go thither, from Holland without delay,) their Instructions accordingly, but with as little Success as before, either there or any where else; so that the French Forces that were in the Country of Cleves and Juliers, finding the Truce expired, were so forward as not to slip any opportu∣nity, and therefore were ready on the 1st of May to pass the
Rhine, over which they had made a Bridge at Ordinghen. Gene∣ral Spaen, who commanded the Troops of Brandenburg, made a shew as if he designed to oppose their Passage, with the few Soldiers and Trained-Bands, he had with him on the other side of that River: But finding the French Army had passed it on flying Bridges above and below Augerarts, at the Confluence of the Auger, and the Rhine, he thought fit to Retreat; and the Consequence of that was; That that General, and the Ele∣ctor's Embassador procured a Conference with Monsieur Colbert, to be held at Santhen, a little Town 3 Leagues from Wesel. Thi∣ther Mr. Blaspiet, and General Spaen went, as did also M. Col∣bert, the 3d of the same Month, the last having ordered Calvo; who commanded the French Forces to be also present, to the End, that according to the Success of the Negotiation, he might de∣sist, or pursue the Enterprize he had had in View. Here it was agreed between them, that the Truce should be prolonged for 15 Days more, to begin the 4th of the Month, which lengthened out the Cessation of Arms till the 19th, but upon Condition that Wesel and Leipstadt, should be put into the French King's Hands, to be kept by him until the Peace betwixt his Majesty, and his Allies on the one side, and his Electoral High∣ness on the other, should be Signed and Ratified; which the E∣lector was so far from making a Difficulty to grant, that he of∣fered even to put Skinkenseance into his Power also, as thinking perhaps, by this extraordinary piece of Confidence, to bring the King to be more easie in the Peace of the North; and this not long after, he also seconded by a Letter to the said Monarch, written in so Excellent a Strain, that not being willing to attempt to express the Force of it by way of Abstract, I shall give the Reader an exact Copy of it. POSTDAM, May 16. 1679. My Lord, IT is impossible but that your Majesty; according to the Great Wis∣dom wherewith God has endowed you, does easily perceive the Moderation and Justice of my Pretensions: And it being so, that you must offer Violence to that Generosity and Greatness of Soul, which is natural to your Majesty, in forcing me to Conditions of Peace that are not only injurious to me, but ignominious also. God, who is Just, seeing the Righteousness of my Cause, hath prospered my Arms with the Conquest of all Pomerania; and your Majesty makes me give back the greatest part of it, which I put into your Hands, that I may preserve the rest, which is but a small Matter in respect of what I have gained with the Loss of my Blood, and the Ruine of my Subjects. Is it not just, my Lord, that since your Majesty obliges me to part from so great and fair Cities, and so much of my Enemies Country, you should likewise oblige the
Swedes to leave me the rest; and that your Majesty having so far concerned your self for the Party that had no Right to demand any thing, should concern your self also for him who had Right to keep all, but yields the greatest part meerly in Consideration of your Majesty? I am informed, that your Ministers object to me the In∣terest of your Glory and Honour; and know that that is a power∣ful Motive to animate a Great Soul to Vndertakings. But suffer me to put you in mind, That Justice is the Source and Rule of Glory: And that I having it on my side, it is far greater and more solid Glory to Support a just and moderate Pretension, than to fa∣vour one that is nothing less. And could your Majesty but hear the Discourse of all Europe, and weigh it with the Reasons that Interests suggest to you from my Enemies, I am confident you would instantly decide in my Favour, and so prevent the Judgment of disinterested Posterity. Withal, my Lord, I am very sensible that the Match is too unequal betwixt your Majesty's Forces and mine, and that I am unable to resist a King, who alone hath car∣ried the Burden of a War against the greatest Powers of Europe, and hath with so much Glory and Success, gone through with it: But can your Majesty find any Advantage in the Ruine of a Prince, who is so desirous to serve you; and who being preserved, may contri∣bute to your Service more than a bare willingness? Your Majesty will certainly be the first that will regret my Ruine, since you cannot ea∣sily find in all the World besides, one who is more really, and with greater Respect and Zeal than my self, Your Majesty's, &c. But for all this, the French King seemed to be inexorable, and his Forces began already to spread themselves in the Mark of Brandenburg; and fresh Troops, with Ammunition and Artil∣lery, came daily to Wesel, to augment the Army which the Mareschal de Crequi, was to command; which, upon the Expi∣ration of the Truce, drew near to the Neighbourhood of Min∣den, beginning to streighten that Place, where General Spaen pretended to make a vigorous Resistance. Hereupon the Mares∣chal de Crequi ordered Monsieur Calvo to pass the Weser with a Party of Horse and Foot, on a Bridge of Boats which he had caused to be made, whilst he himself, with a Body of Horse, went to cross it at a Ford, which, with some Difficulty, he passed over, with an intent to make the Country pay the Contributi∣ons he had demanded; but finding General Spaen was come out of the Town with a Body of about 3000 Men, and some Field-Pieces, he attack'd them vigorously, and the Dispute was very sharp, and ended with the loss of a great many Men on both sides; and at last General Spain retired into Minden. This was the 20th June, 1679. and the last Action that put an end to so great a War; and if the Negotiation of the Peace, which was Signed at St. Germains the Day before, had been a little more hastned, the News of it had come in time to have saved a
great many brave Mens Lives, by preventing that Engage∣ment. The main Purport of this Peace, was, The Re-establish∣ment of the Treaties of Westphailia, without any Derogation from them, except in a few Particulars, and that for avoiding those Differences which commonly arise among Princes about the Confusion of Limits. But the Reader will be better pleased to have the distinct Particulars, and they are these that follow. I. THAT there shall be a firm and lasting Peace between them, and free Commerce by Land and Water. II. All Hostilities to cease within 10 Days, after the Exchange of the Ratification. III. A general Oblivion of all that is past. IV. The Treaties of Munster and Osnuburg to remain in full Force. V. The Elector to restore to Sweden all he has taken in Po∣merin, during this War, as Stetin, Straelsond, &c. VI. But that the Lands on the other side the River Oder, shall remain in Sovereignty to the Elector. VII. That Golnow shall at present remain in the Hands of the Elector, he paying 50000 Crowns to the King of Sweden, who, upon payment of that Sum, shall have the same resto∣red to him. VIII. The King of Sweden quits the Toll, which he recei∣ved at Colberg, and other Places in Pomerania, pursuant to the Treaty made at Stetin, 1653. IX. Quits likewise all Rights and Revenues of the Lands on the other side of the Oder, which remains by this Peace to the Elector. X. Frees the Inhabitants of the Oath of Allegiance by them taken to him. XI. The River Oder to remain in Sovereignty to Sweden; and the Elector is not to build any Forts or strong Holds on it, as far as the Territory of Sweden reaches. XII. The most Christian King shall, presently after the Ex∣change of the Ratification, draw his Forces out of the Coun∣tries and Places of the Elector, except 1000 Horse, who are to remain in Wesel and Lipstadt, till the Peace be entirely con∣cluded. XIII. That the Elector shall draw his Forces out of the Field; but because the King of Sweden wants Troops, the Elector shall keep Garisons in the Places in Pomeren, viz. 2000 Men at Straelsond, 1200 or 1000 in Stetin, and so in other Places pro∣portionable, till such time as Sweden sends over Men to re∣ceive them.
XIV. That the Elector may take away the Cannon and Am∣munition he hath brought into those Places, but must leave what he found there. XV. That all Endeavours shall be used to make the Peace with Denmark; and that, in the mean time, the Elector shall not give that Crown any Assistance. XVI. The most Christian King obliges himself to procure the Crown of Sweden's Ratifications of this Treaty in 3 Months; and, as long as it is wanting, the Elector is not obliged to re∣store the Places above-mentioned. The Ratification between, France and the Elector to be exchanged in a Month. But France,The Elector of Branden∣burg's De∣mands of the States. somewhat to sweeten these hard Conditions put upon this Gallant Prince, the Elector of Brandenburg, in parting with such large Conquests as he had made in the Course of this War upon the Swede, promised, by a Separate Article, to pay, or cause to be paid unto him the Sum of 300000 Crowns to∣wards the re-imbursing, in some manner, the vast Charges he had been at in making and prosecuting the said Conquests. The Elector had no sooner made up Matters, upon these hard Terms, with his Enemies; but he bethinks himself of trying, whether his forsaken Friends, who were the main Occasions to bring him to it, would at all consider him: And therefore he writes a Let∣ter to the States-General, wherein he did set forth, That in the deplorable Condition his Country's Interests in Westphalia were in at that present, it might be easily judged, whether he had more Reason to complain of those, who, as Enemies, had thus fallen upon him; or of those, for whose sake All that had hap∣pened to him; who, instead of giving him the Assistance re∣quired by their Treaties, had neglected them, and made a Se∣parate Peace, thereby as well abandoning his, as their own Affairs, and laying upon him the whole Burden of the War, in which he should have had no part, had it not been for his Desire to help his Friends in their Misfortunes; as if it had been a Con∣solation to their High and Mightinesses, to see him who had en∣deavoured with all his Might to save them from utter De∣struction, as a Recompence, totally ruined; That he did not think it necessary to set before them more Particulars of what he had suffered for his assisting them, and how his Countries of Cleves, Mark, Ravensberg, and Minden, in sight of their Armies, had been quite ruined and desolated; which they had already understood from his Ministers, according to the Orders he had given them; That he had expected they would have returned him an Answer to the Letter, in which he advised them of the Dangers that threatned him, and desired their Assistance, that so at least he might have had the Comfort to see the Concern they had for his Misfortunes; which he had the more Reason to expect, for that it could not but be yet fresh in their High and
Mightinesses Memory, how in their greatest Necessity he had hazarded all for them, and preferred their Friendship before the most advantagious Conditions that were offered him; That their High and Mightinesses would, according to their great Wisdom, comprehend, that he ought not to bear these inesti∣mable Damages for their sake, without Compensation; and that, according to all Right, he ought to expect the same, and his Indemnity from those who might and ought to have pre∣vented them; That therefore he wrote to their High and Mightinesses that Letter, that they might not think that he had swallowed their unjust Proceedings, or quitted the Obligations his Alliance with them, laid upon them: But that, as he on his part, had always performed his Promises and Engagements, and done even more than they required; so he expected the like from them, or in Default thereof, Satisfaction for the same; and reserved to himself, and to his Posterity, all the Right be∣longing thereunto: That he prayed God to preserve them from all Misfortunes, and hostile Invasions for the future; that so they might not, to their great Prejudice, come to know the Consequence of forsaking faithful Friends. The States, who had once before failed in that respect that was due to the Elector, by not answering his former Letter, would not offend further in that Particular, by turning a deaf Ear to this also; tho' in Substance, the Elector had as good as have received no Reply at all. However, they acknowledged, in the first place, the great Services the Elector had rendred their State, and particu∣larly in the late War, assuring him, That they would always keep the same fresh in Memory, and make all suitable Returns, as it should be in their Power. Then they let him see how that they themselves had not been wanting, during the Course of the War, to support, to the utmost of their Abilities, the com∣mon Interests; That if the rest of the Allies had done the like, Things might have had a better Issue: That they were sorry they were forced, thro' the Necessity of their Affairs, to con∣clude the Peace upon the Terms they did; but that when they saw the Spanish Netherlands ready to be lost, themselves ex∣hausted, their Inhabitants ruin'd for want of Trade, and no longer able to bear the Burden of the War, they had been ne∣cessitated to accept of the Conditions offered by France, as Spain likewise had done: That since the Peace, they had laboured all they could, to obtain a Neutrality for his Countries of Cleve and Mark, but to no purpose, France having still refused it; And, in Conclusion, desired he would continue his Friendship with them, which they should always cultivate on their part, as be∣came sincere and true Allies. This is all the Satisfaction that Noble Elector could have for all the Damages he had sustained; Things were now in another Posture with the States, being menaced with no apparent Dan∣ger
from any Quarter. However, they did afterward make him some little sort of Compensation, by paying some Arrears of Subsidies due to him upon the Account of his Assistance in the War, with which he was forced to sit down, and content him∣self to be quiet. But it was not the Elector of Brandenburg alone that thought himself aggrieved, by the Proceedings of the States, and so wanted Reparation, for the Spaniards also put in a great Claim,The Spa∣niards de∣mand Mae∣stricht of the Dutch. and that was the Restitution of Maestricht up to them. You are to understand, that when the Spaniards, (who were one of the first) came in to the States Assistance, against France, in this War; it was stipulated between these Two Powers, among other Things, That Maestricht should be delivered to the Spaniards whenever the Dutch should be in a Condition to do so, (for it was then in the French Hands) in Consideration of so timely a Relief from them, against so for∣midable an Enemy. But for all this, the Dutch taking no no∣tice of that Article, after they had made their Peace with France; the Spaniards now at length were pleased to mind them of it, by several Memorials delivered in by their Embassador, M. de Lyra: Yet the Dutch knowing well, whom they had to deal with,The States Answer. in some time, made no Difficulty to answer; That they did very readily acknowledge the Assistance they had re∣ceived from his Catholick Majesty, in the Beginning of the War; during the Course of which, the States were not want∣ing to support the common Interests to the utmost of their Power; That they were willing to own, that by the Alliance made between the Crown of Spain and them, in the Year 1673, they ought to deliver Maestricht to his Majesty; but that the same Treaty likewise obliged him to the Observance of the Peace of Munster, and all the Stipulations made in consequence thereof; and that accordingly, his Majesty lay under an En∣gagement to make good the Agreement concerning the Prince of Orange, and to satisfie the Debt, which, with the Interest, amounted to near 8000000 of Livres, due to his Highness, by Virtue thereof: That the States had, during the War, caused a Squadron of Men of War to be fitted out for the Service of Sicily; and that great Arrears were still remaining due to the Admiralties upon that Account; and that therefore they pray∣ed his Majesty to give them and the Prince Satisfaction in these Points, and then they would be ready, on their side, to comply with the Obligation of their Treaty, and to restore Mae∣stricht. The Spanish Minister,The Spani∣ard rejoin. not satisfied herewith, shewed himself much surprized, that after the Sollicitation of near 10 Months, and so many Memorials put in by him, he should re∣ceive an Answer so little suitable to the great Assistances (even preceding the Treaty of 1673,) given the States by the Crown of Spain, in the Beginning of the late War; That the Offer of Maestricht was then made voluntary by the States, as an Ac∣knowledgement
of the same, which they ought therefore the rather to make good. For that which concerned the Prince of Orange, the Debt had never been denied, and great Sums had been paid upon that Account, and that the Millions which the Crown of Spain had expended, during the late War, in Subsi∣dies, and Maintenance of Foreign Troops, would more than have satisfied his Highness's Pretensions: That the Crown of Spain did readily acknowledge the great Obligations they the States had to his Highness, for the eminent Services he had rendred them on so many Occasions; That in Satisfaction of his Debt, the Crown of Spain had assign'd him an 100000 Crowns at each Return of the Galeons, and 50000 Crowns of Annual Rents in the Low-Countries: That as to what was owing to the Admiralties, all Care should be taken to satisfie the same: That Maestricht would be of very great Advantage to the Crown of Spain, but none to the States, being so far from their Frontiers; And concluded all with telling them. He knew not how the King his Master would resent this their Proceeding, or what he might resolve upon, in return thereof, concerning the Dutch Effects;The Spanish Ambassador resents it. For, that he was ignorant whether his Majesty would act therein, according to his Royal Goodness, or according to the Justice and Right of the Thing. The Minister, indeed, Don Emanuel de Lyra, might resent the Proceedings of the States, tho' to his own Damage, as he did in refusing their usual Present to Embassadors; but the Court of Spain proved of ano∣ther Temper, knowing well the crasie Constitution of their State at that time; and that they were not in a Condition to procure Satisfaction for the supposed Injury. However, the States endeavoured the Year following to make them some Re∣paration, by mediating between France and Spain, a Remission of the former's Pretensions to the Title of Duke of Burgundy, which the latter always possest till this Treaty of Nimeguen; And which, notwithstanding the great Deference the French King seemed to have to the Interposition of the States, the Catholick King, under the specious Pretences of being desi∣rous to take away all Occasion that might be made use of to disturb the Peace, and from the particular Regard he had to the Instances of the States (who sollicited both Parties in that be∣half) totally remitted to the French King, who from thence for∣ward inserted, among the rest of his Titles, that of Duke of Burgundy. There remained now no Negotiation undecided, but that of Denmark and Sweden, towards the compleating of which Conferences had been daily set on foot at Lounden in Schonen: But the Negotiation which M. de Mayerkron had begun at the French Court, gave the greatest Hopes that the Peace would e're long be concluded on that side also; and the French, to ha∣sten it, sent a considerable Detachment of Cavalry, under the
Command of the Marquess of Joyeuse, through the Territories of the Elector of Brandenburg, into the Countries of Oldenburg and Delmenhurst, which put all the Country under Contributi∣on; and wrought such an Effect upon the Danish Envoy at Paris, that the Treaty was fully concluded between France, Sweden and Denmark, on the 2d of Sept. at St. Germains, M. Pom∣pone having full Power from the French King to that Purpose. The Treaties of Roscheld, Copenhagen, and Westphalia were the Ground-work of this Peace with Denmark, as will better ap∣pear by this Abstract. I. THAT there be a firm Peace between the said Kings, and all Things during the War, to the Offence of ei∣ther, forgotten. II. That all Alliances, made by either of the Three Kings to the Prejudice of the other, shall cease and be abolished, and they shall not make any which may be so for the future. III. That Hostilities do cease within a Fortnight, reckoning from the Day of the Signing, except in Norway, where 3 Weeks shall be allowed, because of the Distance. IV. That the Treaties of Roscheld, Copenhagen, and West∣phalia shall be confirmed, with all the Instruments to them ap∣pertaining. V. The King of Denmark promises to restore whatever he hath taken from the Swedes during the War, viz. Landscroon, Helsenburg, Monstrand, and Wisma, with the Isles of Rugen and Gothlaend, and all their Dependances. VI. In like manner the King of Sweden promises to restore what he has taken from Denmark during the War. VII. That Commissioners shall be appointed by the Two Northern Crowns, who shall meet within 6 Months, a Minister from the most Christian King being present, and shall endea∣vour to compose all Differences arisen on occasion of Priviledges and Immunities which the Swedes pretend to in the Sound and the Baltick; provided, that the said Priviledges and Immuni∣ties do remain in full Force and Vigour, the Abuses only to be corrected. VIII. The Places to be restored to Sweden shall be delivered up in the same Condition as they are at present, viz. Helsen∣burg, Landscoon, and all other Places possessed by the King of Denmark, in Schonen, Pleiing, and Holland, together with Ca∣relstadt, and the Fort on the River Swinge, within 2 Weeks, Wismar, and the Isle of Rugen within 3, Marstrond, and the Isle of Gothland within 4 Weeks, to be reckoned from the Day of the Exchange. IX. The King of Denmark may take out of the Places, to be restored, what Cannon he caused to be brought into them since they were in his Possession; but the Cannon that were in the
Places when taken, and still remain there, to be restored with the Places. But if the King of Denmark hath formerly taken out of those Places, the Cannon that belonged to the Swedes, he shall restore the one half thereof. X. All Goods and Estates confiscated, during the War, shall be restored. XI. All Persons shall be restored to the Rights and Privi∣ledges they enjoyed before the War. XII. The Country of Rixengen, belonging to the Count Ethlefelt, Chancellor of Denmark, confiscated during the War, shall be restored to him. XIII. All Prisoners to be set at Liberty. XIV. All such Princes as desire it, shall be comprehended in this Treaty. XV. The most Christian King promises, that the King of Sweden shall ratifie this Treaty within 3 Months. XVI. The most Christian King promises to ratifie the same within 6 Weeks. But of all other Points conceded by the Dane in this Treaty, none seemed so hard as this last relating to the Duke of Hol∣stein Gottorp, who, for being an Ally in this War to the Swede, Denmark had stripped of all his Dominions, but is now forced to re-instate him in as ample Form as could be, and he pretend to, unless it were the Damage which his Territories had su∣stained during the War, by the vast Sums of Money which the King of Denmark had raised therein, as being one of the best Countries in all the North. And thus ended this long and bloody War in Europe, but with as much Dissatisfaction to al∣most all the Allies, as it was advantageous to France, who was left in a Condition by it to do what she would, as we shall have occasion to note hereafter. It was very hard upon all the Al∣lies, harder yet to the Elector of Brandenburg, but to none more than the King of Denmark, who had no manner of Com∣pensation for all the Conquests he had made in the Course of it; and I think, was no less dishonourable to England every way, whose Mediation, though continued even to the last, yet through some evil Aspect or other, had not the Happiness of Signing any one of the Treaties. And as for the Duke of Lor∣rain, as he had nothing in Possession, so he lost nothing but his Expectation, which, in the Sequel, appeared to be ill ground∣ed, tho' upon the direct and frequent Engagements both of the Confederates and Mediator. And so that noble, tho' unfortu∣nate Prince, was wholly left out of the Treaty, and without any visible Hopes of ever recovering the Dominion of his An∣cestors. And here we shall at present leave it, and return to see what has been doing all this while in England.
About the 29th of Sept. the preceding Year, which was 1678, Dr. Oats, seconded after by Tongue and Kirby, made a Disco∣very of an horrid Plot,Popish Plot discovered. carried on by Jesuits, and others of the Roman Communion, against the Life and Person of the King, Protestant Religion, and Established Government; and for a further Confirmation of his Testimony, Oats referred himself to Coleman's Papers, who was Secretary to the then Dutchess of York: But though the Court could not but enquire into the Truth of this, yet they made such slow Paces in it, that Cole∣man had time enough to convey away all the Papers of the 2 last Years, with his Book of Entries of them. However, those Let∣ters that were found, amazed the major part of the Council, and thereupon several Persons were examined and commit∣ted, viz. Sir George Wakeman, the Queen's Physician, Coleman, Langborn of the Inner-Temple, Tho. Whitebread, Provincial of the Jesuits in England, James Corker and Thomas Pickering, all Jesuits, Priests and Monks, with divers others. And not long after William Earl of Powis, William Viscount Stafford, Henry Lord Arundel of Warder, William Lord Petre, and John Lord Bellasis, were sent Prisoners, upon the same Account, to the Tower of London. But, tho' these and other Circumstances made the Matter pretty clear, yet the Murder of Sir Edmund∣bury Godfrey, a Justice of the Peace, before whom some of the Depositions had been taken, and who appear'd zealous against all Male Practices against the King and Government, soon af∣ter, viz. on the 12th of Oct. rendred the Conspiracy in the Sight of most Men, to be past all doubt: And therefore, the Parliament, who met upon the 21 st of Oct. after having appoint∣ed a Secret Committee, to enquire into the Bottom of the Plot, did, upon the 1st of Nov. following, come to this Resolution, Nemine Contradicente, That upon the Evidence that hath al∣ready appeared to this House, this House is of Opinion, that there hath been, and still is, a damnable Hellish Plot, contri∣ved and carried on by Recusants, for assassinating and mur∣dering the King, subverting the Government, and rooting out and destroying the Protestant Religion.Godfrey murdered. I am not insen∣sible what Artifices have been used to ridicule this Plot in all the Parts of it, and particularly so far as it relates to the Mur∣der of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey: But there are some Things so particular herein for evincing, That that Gentleman fell a Mar∣tyr through Popish Cruelty, and yet not commonly known, that I shall take notice of them in this place. There was one Prance, a Papist by Religion, and a Silversmith by Trade, li∣ving near Covent-Garden, and one that wrought for the Priests and others in Somerset-House, who, some time after the said Murder, being observed to abscond from his House for several Days by his Neighbours; some of them represented the same to some Parliament-Men, with other circumstantial Suspicions
they had of the said Prance; and thereupon there was an Order got to seize him; and he was referred to the Examination of Sir Richard Everard, and Sir Charles Harboard. Now before the Murder, Le Pair, Pritchard, and some other Priests, had treated with bedlow to be assisting in it; which he at first as∣sented to, but after relented and did not come: But the Mon∣day after the Fact was committed, which was Octob. 14. meeting with La Faire, in Red-Lyon-Court, he charged him with being worse than his Word, but engaged him to meet him at 9 a Clock, in Somerset-House, where he was told by La Faire, That though he was not assistant as he promised in killing Sir Edmund, yet if he would be helpful to carry him off, he should have 2000l. Reward. Hereupon Bedlow desiring to see the Body, Le Faire shewed it him, and then they advised together about the Disposal of it, Bedlow being of Opinion, it were best to sink it in the River with Weights, which was not agreed to. But in seeing the Body, Bedlow saw Pranoe in the Company too, yet did not know him before. This being done, Bedlow went to Bristol; but finding himself much troubled in Conscience, having twice taken the Sacra∣ment to conceal the Business, God put it into his Heart, that some Murders being past, and to prevent greater to come, he was convinced it was his Duty to return to London to reveal what he knew; which he did, and went to the Lobby of the House of Lords in order to it. In the mean time Sir Charles Harboard and Sir Richard Everard having examined Prance, and the House being set, left him to the Care of the Constable of Covent-Garden, who brought him to the Lobby of the Lords House; where Bedlow seeing him, but never before, save the foresaid Time in Somerset-House, he charged the Guards to seize him for that reason, saying, He remembred him well, he having, when they viewed Sir Edmund's Body, a black Perruke on, but now none. Hereupon search being made, the Perruke was found. And hence it was that Prance became an Evidence in this Discovery, and on whose Evidence chiefly Green, Berry, and Hill were convicted and executed. I shall not enter into any more Particulars of this Plot, as being already sufficiently treated on by divers Authors, and not falling directly under under the Course of our present Design; but there is one Thing very remarkable attending it, and such, I think, as can hardly be parallel'd in any other Story, and that is, that there should be so many, and such clear Proofs to Murder the King's Person, and yet, that he should be solittle apprehensive of it. But it may be, as Tom. Killigrew was said to have told him, He knew more of the Plot than any Body else, and his Discovery of it, would quickly have satisfied his People. But whether it were my Lord Treasurer Danby's Business, or the Popish Lords in the Tower, or the Affairs of the Plot in general, the King having on Mon∣day,
the 30th of Dec. last, Prorogued both Houses to the 4th of Feb. did on the 24th of Jan. Dissolve his once Darling, Long∣lived, but now Expiring Parliament; which had been continued by several Prorogations, and Adjournments, 17 Years, 8 Months, and 17 Days, being first called on the 8th of May, 1661. And issued out Writs to call another, to Sit at Westminister on the 6th of March following; but thought it on the 28th of Feb. in the Interim, to direct a Letter to the Duke of York, his Brother, to command him to withdraw beyond Sea, to this Effect; I Have already given you my Resolves at large,K. Charles II's Letter to the Duke of York. why I think it fit, that you absent your self for some time beyond the Seas; I am truly sorry for the Occasion, so may you be sure, I shall never desire it longer than it shall be absolutely necessary for your Good, and my Service. In the mean time, I think it proper to give it you under my Hand, that I expect this Compliance from you, and desire it may be as soon as conveniently you can. You may easily perceive with what Trouble I write this to you, there being nothing I am more sensible of, than the constant Kindness you have ever had for me. I hope, you are as just to me to be assured, that no Absence, nor any Thing else, can ever change me from being truly and kindly. Yours, C. R. The Duke with his Dutchess, and Family, in pursuance to this Command, within a few Days withdrew accordingly, and for a while retired to the Hague, and from thence to Brussels; while the King in the mean time, that he might let the World see, how he was otherways, as well as therein, become a new Man for the future, did upon the 20th of Apr. make a Declaration to this Purpose, in Council, and in his new Parliament; and afterward Published it to the whole Nation; How sensible he was of the ill Posture of his Affairs, and the great Dissatis∣factions, and Jealousies of his good Subjects, whereby the Crown and Government were become too weak to preserve it self; which proceeded from his use of a single Ministry, and of pri∣vate Advices,K. Charles II chooses a new Coun∣cil. and therefore professed his Resolution to lay them aside for the future, and to be advised by those whom he had chosen for his Council, in all his weighty and impor∣tant Affairs, together with the frequent Advice of his great Council in Parliament; The Members that composed which Council, because of the great Worth of most of them, we shall give the Reader a List of.

Edward Seymour, Esq Henry Pawle, Esq But notwithstanding this Appearance of so mighty a Change in the King, and the Profession of his Readiness, to give way to any Law that might secure the Protestant Religion, so as the Succession were not altered; yet the same Temper, and same sort of People still remained at Court, and they were a very chargeable Crew; wherefore Money was craved at that time, tho' under pretence, of providing a Fleet for our common Se∣curity, now (as Mr. Coke says,) in time of such a Peace as the French King had granted Christendom, after King Charles had taken his Money to join in it; and after he had taken the Parlia∣ment's Money, to enter into an actual War against France, and after the Parliament had twice given Money for Disbanding the said Army; But this the Parliament however did not appear
very forward to give, being mightily troubled with the Prophet at the Bleating of that sort of Cattle, but more, that they could not have the same Answer concerning them, from the King, as Saul made, That he reserved them for a Sacrifice, and intended to deliver them up to please his People. The Effects of this Proce∣dure, was at first a Prorogation of both Houses on the 27th of May, to the 14th of Aug. and the Dissolving of them upon the 12th of July; and so much the sooner without doubt, because they had begun this Sessions to nibble at a Bill for Excluding the Duke of York, from inheriting the Imperial Crown of England: So that this Parliament proved to be as short-lived, as the o∣ther had been durable, and lasting; but another was called, to meet the 17th of Oct.Insurrection in Scotland. While England was in this ottering, and uncertain Condition, Scotland was not a whit the better settled, the Feuds between the Episcopal, and Presbyterian Party increasing daily, which at last, on the 3d of May this Year, brake out into a very barbarous Act, by the Murdering of Dr. Sharp, Archbishop of St. Andrews, by a Party of Covenan∣ters, who, besides the severity he used towards them, since his exaltation to that Dignity, made himself the more obnoxious to their Rage, because, that having once been a great Zealot for Presbyterian-Church-Government; they esteemed him now for no other than a Perjured Apostate Prelate, a Villain, Per∣secutor of the Godly, and a betrayer of Jesus Christ, and his Church. This was only a general Accusation, but some of that Nation have farther confidently affirm'd, That the King ha∣ving sent down a Pardon to some Offenders, and the same fal∣ling into Sharp's Hands, he villanously concealed it, till Exe∣cution was done upon them; And that the Friends of the deceas'd, having not been able to procure Satisfaction from him according to the ordinary Course of Law; he by his Interest and Autho∣rity being now about it, were necessitated to have Recourse to this extraordinary Method. But tho' things did begin here, they did not end so, this Fact proving a Prelude to what followed, for upon the 29th of the same Month, a Party of about 80 of these Covenanters met at a place called Rugland, well Mounted and Armed, and when they had first Proclaimed the Covenant, they burnt the following Acts, viz. The Act concerning the King's Supremacy, the Recessory Act, (whereby all the Laws made during the King's Exile were Repealed,) the Act for Establishing Epis∣copacy, and the Act appointing the Anniversary of the 29th of May. On Sunday, June the 1st. they rendevouz'd about 1500 Men upon Snouden-Hill, their Foot being commanded by one Wyer, and their Horse by Robert Hambleton, one Parron, with the Assistance of Balfour and Hackstock, which two last were of the Number of those that had Assassinated the Archbishop. From hence they proceeded, and took the City of Glascow, where they published Two Proclamations, which were to this Effect.
WE the Officers of the Covenanted Army,The Scotch Rebels Pro∣clamation., do Require and Com∣mand you the Inhabitants of the Burgh of Glascow, to fur∣nish us with 24 Carts, and 60 Horses, for removing our Provisions from this Place to our Camp, where-ever we shall set down the Same, and to abide with us for that End, during our Pleasure, under Pain of being reputed our Enemies, and proceeded against accordingly. The other was, WE the Officers of the Covenanted Army,Their Se∣cond Pro∣clamation. do Require and Com∣mand the Magistrates of Glascow, to extend and banish forth thereof, all Archbishops, Bishops, and Curates, their Wives, Bearns, Servants, and Families, and Persons concerned in the King's Army, within 48 Hours after Publishing hereof, under highest Pains. And they published a long Declaration of their taking up Arms, for a free General Assembly, and a free Unlimited Par∣liament, to redress the manifold Grievances therein enumerated; and humbly requested his Majesty to restore all Things, as he found them, when God brought him Home to his Crown and Kingdoms. In the mean time, the Council at Edenburg were not idle, but raised an Army, and quartered it at a Place called Black-burn, to prevent the Covenanters approach to Edenburg, and gave the King an Account of all that passed, expecting his Majesty's further Orders thereupon. Whereupon the King dispatch'd away the Duke of Monmouth into Scotland, who, with wonderful Celerity, having joyned the Army, did on the 22th of June, approach towards that of the Covenanters, who lay in the little Park at Hamilton, and thereabouts having chosen very advantageous Ground, there being no Passage to it, but over a Stone-Bridge, called Bothwel-Bridge, which they had barricadced, and well-lined with Musketeers. They had no notice of the Duke's March, which was in very good Order, and in great Silence; but their Guards having at length dis∣covered the lighted Matches, they took the Alarm, and there∣upon put themselves in a fighting Posture. Major Oglethorp, with the Dragoons, had Orders to post himself near the Bridge, while the Duke drew up the Army upon the Hill that fronted Hamilton-Park (the River being between him and the Enemy) about a Mile from the Bridge. The Covenanters were drawn up in Two distinct Bodies, about a Mile asunder, the smallest whereof lay near the Bridge, and the other hard by their Camp.They make Proposals to the Duke of Monmouth. Being in this Posture on each side, the Duke was no sooner come to Oglethorp's Post, but there came over to him one David Hume, from the Covenanters, and presented him with their Declaration, together with a Petition, signed by Robert
Hamilton, in the Name of the Covenanted Army, then in Arms; wherein they prayed, that the Terms of their Decla∣ration might be made good, and a safe Conduct to be granted to some of their Number, to address themselves to the Duke in that Matter. To this, the Duke answered, That he would not treat with them upon their Declaration, but if they would readily lay down their Arms, he would receive them into the King's Mercy. With which Answer they went back, desiring some time to de∣liberate upon it, which the Duke granted: But about half an Hour after, in return, they sent a Paper by a Drummer, repre∣senting; That being informed that his Grace came from England, with Terms to be offered to them, they desired to know what he had to propose, that they might advise, whether the Terms were such as they could accept of. Whereupon the Duke finding they trifled, sent them Word, He would receive no more Messages from them. While things passed thus between the Duke and them,The Duke of Monmouth fights and routs the Covenan∣ters. his Cannon, with some Horse and Foot, were brought down from the Body of the Army, and posted not far from the Bridge, which he immediately commanded to play; and which was no sooner perceived by the Covenanters, but they threw themselves upon the Ground to avoid the Shot: Those of them that were posted on the Bridge, fired at first very briskly, but after five or six Shot of Cannon, they all ran away, they upon the rising-Ground running first. The Duke then advanced, and his Men seizing upon the Bridge, threw their Barricadoes of Stones, Cart-wheels, and the like, into the River, took one Piece of Cannon, and pursued them up the Hill; but the Covenanters perceiving their Numbers to be small, they rallied, and faced about, yet would not venture to come down upon them, tho' the Duke's Men retired back to the Bridge. In the mean time the Duke passed the Army over the Bridge, and drew them up on the rising-Ground, which took up some time, and upon whom the Covenanters advanced in very good Order, before the other had time enough to do so; but upon their approach, espying the Cannon at the Head of the Duke's Army, they immediate∣ly sifted their Order, and opened in the middle, thinking, as 'twas supposed, they were obliged to shoot streight forward; yet the Cannon being turned upon them, as they then stood, and 3 or 4 times discharged, they began to run, their Com∣mander Robert Hamilton, being one of the first; and the Dra∣goons advancing upon them, it was a perfect Rout, they flying, and being pursued all Ways, there being between 7 and 800 of them slain, but a far greater Number taken Prisoners. Thus ended this extravagant Undertaking of the Scots, which served only to make their Chains the heavier, as doubtless the imploy∣ing the Duke of Monmouth to suppress them, was intended for no good to him neither, his Court-Enemies thinking thereby
to render him odious to the Presbyterians, and other Dissenters in England, but there their Politicks failed them; for the Fears of Popery, and a Popish Successor at this time, had very deep∣ly possessed Men's Minds, and the Duke's Person, after the King's, was the only visible One they had to rely upon to stave off the dreadful Monster;The Story of the black Box. and of this, the Popish Faction were mighty jealous, and so much the rather, because there was a Pamphlet printed and handed about, that the King had been married to the Duke of Monmouth's Mother, and rumour'd A∣broad, That Sir Gilbert Gerrard had a black Box, wherein the said Marriage was fully proved, and made out; And indeed the Fears of the Duke of York's succeeding to the Crown, were such, that the People were willing to lay hold on any Twig, and so to be very easie of Belief in the Particulars of this Story; But he the Matter as it will, the Tories and Popish Party had such an Influence at Court, that the King began now to ap∣pear Heart and Soul theirs, and so made Three Declarations; the first in the Presence of W. Cant. H. Finch, C. H. Coventry, and J. Williamson, the 6th of Jan. 1679. wherein he declared, That they who should say he was married, or contracted to the Duke of Monmouth's Mother, were neither his, nor the Duke's Friends; and declared in the Presence of Almighty God, That he never was married, nor contracted to any other Woman whatsoever, but his Wife Queen Catharine. Upon the 3d of March following, he caused this Declaration to be entred into the Council-Book, being all written, and sign'd with his own Hand, in a Paper he delivered in at the Board, to be kept in the Council-Chest, viz. FOR the avoiding of any Dispute which may happen in time to come,K. Charles II. disclaims a∣ny Marriage with the Duke of Monmouth's Mother. concerning the Succession of the Crown, I do hereby de∣clare in the Presence of Almighty God, That I never gave, nor made any Contract of Marriage, nor was married to any Wo∣man whatsoever, but to my present Wife, Queen Catharine, now living. Whitehall, March the 3d. 1679. Charles R. And because they might make sure Work of it, the same Thing was again repeated on the 2d of June, 1680. with As∣severations to the same Purpose, wherein he called the Report of his Marriage, or Contract with Mrs. Walters, alias Barlow, the Duke of Monmouth's Mother, false and scandalous; and charged all his Subjects not to presume to utter or publish any such Thing, and all those were published together by his special Order, which, tho' distant in Time, I thought fit to mention
together, to avoid an interrupted Discourse, as much as possibly I was able. And that the King might further gratifie that Faction, as well as he had done the Nation, in sending the Duke of York out of it, he sent the Duke of Monmouth away also.K. Charles II. sick, and the Conse∣quence of it. The King, towards the latter end of Aug. fell ill at Windsor, and his Indisposition in a little time proved to be an Ague: I will not deny, but Monmouth did, at that time, double the Guards, and shew more Activity than ordinary, in the Management of Things; and for my part, I do think, if the King had gone off suddenly, the Duke would have bid very fair for the Crown. However, the King was in no Danger, tho' his Brother the Duke of York apprehended himself to be so in that Conjuncture; and therefore he had no sooner Notice of the King's Illness, which was early enough, but he posted to Court with all Expedition; and on the 2d of Dec. arrived at Windsor; the Consequence whereof, was the Duke of Mon∣mouth's Banishment, who thereupon retired to Vtretch, as his Unkle the Duke of York, did in a little time back again to Brus∣sels; but this last, without any Design to stay: For on the 12th of Oct. he, with his whole Family, arrived at St. James's, to the Surprize of most People. The other, was resolved not to be long behind him; for being informed, that Banishment is a Punishment, which the King cannot inflict upon any Man, unless he be convicted of some ill Crime; he returned also on the 27th of Nov. at Night to London, at which, the Citizens express'd a mighty Joy by Bonefires and Ringing of Bells all the next Day,Duke of Monmouth out of fa∣vour. and most part of the Night that followed. But by how much the more Affectionate the Citizens and Nation ap∣peared to be towards him, the King and his Court proved to be so much the less so; For all his Places of Profit and Trust, were immediately taken from him: Whereas the Duke of York was sent High Commissioner into Scotland, where the Duke of Monmouth's Victory at Blackbourn, had left a clear Field for the other to play his Game. But this did not well agree with the King's Speech at the Opening of the last Parliament; When he said, That he had commanded his Brother to absent himself from him, because he would not leave malicious Men room to say, that he had not removed all Causes which could be pretended to influence him to Popish Councils, and a little Time will shew it. You have heard before, that the King by Proclamation, dis∣solved the Parliament upon the 12th of July, and issued out Writs for the Meeting of another on the 17th of Oct. following; But, like the usual Methods of many other Things in this Reign, when they met, they were prorogued to the 26th of Jan. and from thence to the 5th of Ap. 1680. and further, from thence to the 21st of Oct. when he graciously declared, they should Sit and do Business. These were strange doings, and therefore the more sober Part of the Nation, and such as had a
due Regard to the publick Good, bestirred themselves in the Interval of the first Prorogation, to move the King, in the most dutiful Manner, for the Sitting of the Parliament; and that you may have a true Idea of the Matter, we will give you an Instance or two of the Entertainment they met with at Court upon this Occasion. There came several Petitions, to this end, from divers Counties and Corporations, and, among the rest, one from Wiltshire, was, on the 22th of Jan. presented to the King by Thomas Thynne, Esq accompanied by Sir Walter St. Johns, and Sir Edward Hungerford. He asked them, Whe∣ther they had Directions from the Grand Jury for what they did? And Mr. Thynne having answered,K. Charles II's different Carriage to the Addres∣sors. No; the King replied, Why say you then that you come from the Country? You came from a Company of loose, disaffected People; What do they take me to be? And what do you take your selves to be? I admire Gentlemen of your Estates should animate People to Mutiny and Rebellion; you would not take it well, I should meddle with your Affairs; and I desire you will not meddle with mine, especially with a Matter that is so essential a Part of my Prerogative. Another Petition of the like Nature, being presented to him the Day following, by Sir Gabriel Barrington, Coll. Mildmay, Mr. Honywood, &c. in the Names of themselves, and others the Inhabitants of the County of Essex; the Answer was, That he was extreamly sur∣prized to see them meddle with Matters that so immediately concern∣ed the Crown and him, and that against the Sense of the best and chiefest Men in the County; that he believed that some of those that had Signed the Petition, might mean well, but that they were abused by those that did not. To which he was pleased to add (in my Mind, a very strange Passage) That he was not willing to call to mind Things past, yet, that he could not but remember the Act of Oblivi∣on, tho' not as some did; That those who had stood in need of that Act, would do well not to take such Courses, as might need another; and that he very well remembred 40; and so turned away. And for the Berkshire Gentlemen, and their Petition, which was presented the same Day, from their Quarter-Sessions, he was pleased to droll it out, saying, That they would agree that Matter over a Cup of Ale, when they met at Windsor; tho' he wondered, that his Neighbours would meddle with his Business. Farther, that the Nation, as well as these respective Gentlemen, might not be ignorant of the Court-Sentiments in these Matters, these Answers were publickly inserted in the Gazzettes, but without the Petitions, as if they would have it suggested slily to the World, that there were some audacious and very criminal Things contained in them. Whereas, the Abhorrers of Peti∣tioning, and consequently of Parliaments, and of the Funda∣mental Constitution of our Government, had the Honour of having their Addresses put in ample Manner into the Publick Prints, (which, in these Times, were stuffed with nothing else)
many of them to be Dubbed Knights, and a good Soak of Wine in the King's Cellar to boot, by particular Order; which I know to be true on my own Knowledge. The King being found to be of this Humour, and there happening to be so long an Interval of Parliament, by the several Prorogations that were made, and the Duke doing what he pleased in Scotland, there could be no very earnest Prosecution of the Popish Plot, you may well imagine; nay, it was so far ridiculed in this Time, by L'Estrange and others, Pensioners of the Tory Party, that indifferent Men began to doubt, whether there were any such Thing or no, while the Popish Faction began to trump up a new Plot upon the Whigs or Dissenters; But their Designs being not laid close enough, though the Devil was at the Bot∣tom of them, they failed; and so I will leave Matters till the Sitting of the Parliament, and see what they are doing all this while beyond the Seas. King Charles finding himself weak at Home,Mr. Sidney sent Embas∣sador into Holland, and for what▪ tho' I must speak my Conscience, I know of no one so great an Instrument of it as himself, it was high time to make some Alliances Abroad; and the rather, since France by the late Peace was grown so ex∣tream Powerful, and in the Main, had no great Reason to be satisfied with his Conduct, whatever good Meen they were pleased from time to time to put upon it; he sent Mr. Sidney into Holland towards the latter end of the last Year, to propose to the States the making a Treaty of Guarranty for the Peace concluded at Nimeguen. France did then most industriously op∣pose that Alliance, but yet in a covert Manner at first, by a Stratagem as odd as it might seem to some Extravagant; There being a Letter conveyed to the States-General from an unknown Hand, wherein was represented at large, the ill Posture those Provinces were fallen to, which was the Reason the Neigh∣bouring Princes had not the same Regard for their Republick, as formerly; witness the Menaces of Spain, Denmark, Branden∣burg, &c. and that the only way to restore the States into the Condition it was in formerly, was, to enter into a strict Alli∣ance with France, in pursuance of which, the French King would maintain 50000 Men in Arms, and the States need not keep above 10000 Foot, and 6000 Horse and Dragoons in their Pay; That by that means those Provinces would be able to defend themselves against any whomsoever that should attack them; That that Alliance should be confirmed every Year by mutual Oaths by the French Embassador at the Hague, and the Dutch one at Paris; And this being effected, the Subjects of their Republick should have alone the Trade in that King's Do∣minions, to the Exclusion of all other Nations. This was soon after seconded with a Memorial by the French Embassador, concerning an Alliance the King his Master offered to enter into with the States, to be founded upon the Foot of the Trea∣ty
made, An. 1662. which Offers were further enforced, by re∣presenting unto them, as well the Advantage that would ac∣crue to them upon their accepting, as the Inconveniencies that might follow upon their refusal of it; and telling them, that any Delay in the Affair would be looked upon as a Re∣fusal, and that his Master would regulate himself according∣ly. But the States taking some time to deliberate, and demur∣ring upon the Matter, they received Letters in the mean while from their Embassadors at Paris, importing, That being sent for by Monsieur Colbert, and going to him, he had put them in mind of the many Obligations the States had to the King his Master, and of the particular Demonstration he had given them of his Affection, in offering them a Peace in the midst of his Conquests, upon the Terms he did; That he had since ex∣pected Overtures from them of a nearer Alliance; But they having been wanting, he had himself for some time since, made an Offer of the same by his Embassadors at the Hague; That it had been debated in the Assembly of the States of Holland; and that the said States had Adjourned themselves, without coming to any Resolution therein; That the King was much surprized to find them make so small an Account of an Alliance which they themselves had sought for some Years before by an Extraordinary Embassadors, now the same was offered them; That this Alliance proposed, was only Defensive, which the States could receive no Prejudice by, but much Advantage; That his Majesty understood that the King of England did op∣pose them, while he pretended to make himself an Alliance with them; and that his Majesty would have great Cause to be dissatisfied with the States, if they should refuse the Overtures made by him, and instead thereof, close with those of the King of England; concluding, That his Majesty (as his Embassador the Count d' Avaux had already told them) would take their Delay for a Refusal; That, however, he would keep the Peace with them, but would at the same time look upon them as a State that did not deserve to live in good Amity with him, and would not favour their Commerce. Mr. Henry Sidney, the King's Embassadors in Holland, (as I told you) and now Earl of Rumney, was no sooner informed of the foresaid Memorial and Proceedings of France, but he put in a like Memorial to the States, shewing, That the King his Master, having understood the Proposals that had been made them by the French Embassadors, could not believe that the States could so far forget their own, and common Interests of Christendom, as to accept of them; That his Majesty particu∣larly would have Cause, after their having refused the Act of Guarranty which he lately offered to enter into with them, for securing their present Peace, to resent their entring into any new Engagements with France, especially since his Majesty might
have just Cause to be jealous, that the same could have no other end, than to enable the French King to shew his Resentments of the Peace his Majesty had made with the States in 1674, and of what his Majesty did afterward, in order to the procuring a more advantageous Peace for them and their Allies, than that which was made at Nimeguen; That such a Resolution in the States, would certainly prejudice that strict Union and Friend∣ship that was established between him and them, and oblige his Majesty to take other Measures; But that his Majesty, for his part, would not only punctually comply with what was stipula∣ted and agreed in the Defensive Treaty made between England and Holland, the 3d of Mar. 1678, if they would reject the French Alliance, but also stand by them to the uttermost, if they should be attack'd by France. Mr. Sidney's Address and Diligence in the Prosecution of this Matter was admirable, and succeeded so well, that the States determined civilly to refuse the Alliance proposed by France. But the French King having declared, he was not satisfied there∣with, his said Embassador made another Effort to divert the States from their intended Resolution, shewing, That he had received further Orders from the King his Master, to acquaint them, That his Majesty was extreamly astonished at their manner of Proceedings in the Matter of the Alliance by him proposed, and highly resented it; That he was commanded to expect some Days longer their final Resolution in that Affair; but that afterward he should say no more of it, nor accept any Act which they should offer; and that then they must expect his Master would take such Measures as he thought necessary for the Good of his Kingdoms, and the Advantage of his Sub∣jects in their Commerce; That Mons. Colbert had told their Embassadors at Paris, The King his Master wonder'd extream∣ly to find all Persons in Holland full of Hopes, (which their Letters had given them) That his Majesty would not depart from the Execution of the Peace; and that if they would not enter into that Alliance with him, they should only suffer some∣what in their Commerce; That the Sense of what he had then told them from the King his Master, had been wrong delivered by them, and worse interpreted at the Hague; That his Ma∣jesty did not threaten them with his Indignation, but the Dis∣satisfaction which he had conceived at their Proceedings, might perhaps be the Occasion of greater Prejudice to them, than the Indignation of others; and that they would do well to con∣sider what had happened to them within 8 or 10 Years past, the Beginnings whereof had been less considerable, than the just Dissatisfaction which their present Conduct gave the King his Master. D' Avaux had no sooner ended, but Mr. Sidney was ready to oppose; who, after he had take notice to the States of the great Earnestness of the French, to press them in∣to
their Alliance, he thought fit to repeat his Instances to dis∣swade them from it; That the King his Master did not pre∣tend to make use of Threats, of which the Memorials of the French mbassador were full, but would leave them wholly to be guided by the Consideration of their own Interests; That his Majesty did perswade himself, that after the Assurances of Assistance he had given them, in whatever might happen, they would not enter into any Engagements, which his Majesty should have Cause to look upon as intended against him; and that the Instances of the French King, which were too sharp and pressing for a Free Republick, would not divert them from their true Interests, and from that strict Friendship that was between his Majesty and their State, and of which his Majesty had given them such essential Proofs.K. Charles makes a De∣fensive Alli∣ance with Holland. This was no sooner done, but the States of Holland came to an unanimous Resolution, not to accept of the Alliance which was proposed them by France, and their Example soon after, was followed by those of Guelder∣land, Vtretch, Zealand, and Over-Issel, &c. But those of Gron∣ningen and Ommelands were of another Opinion. Though this proved of no Advantage to France; for notwithstanding the Difference of those Provinces from the rest, as they com∣monly used to do in most other Cases, yet it signified next to nothing, since in Matters of a Negative, Plurality of Voices carried it: And France finding Things would not drive as they designed it, wisely let the same drop, and took no further notice. The French had no sooner got out of the War, by which they had been so much Gainers, but they began to think of a∣nother Method,The Dau∣phine in∣tended to marry. for the present, of enlarging their Dominions; and that was, by marrying the Dauphine to some Princess or other, that might afford them some Pretensions, and at last, pitched upon the young Elector of Bavaria's Sister, to which Court, Monsieur Colbert was dispatch'd, and who, upon his Arrival, made the following Proposals. I. That his most Christian Majesty, out of the great Respect and good Will he had to his Electoral Highness, made him an Offer of a Princess of his own Blood in Marriage. II. That for a greater Testimony of that his good Will, and to advance the Elector's Glory, in case he had Thoughts of becoming Emperor, and, in order thereunto, to be chosen King of the Romans, his Majesty would not only assist him with his good Offices, but with his Services also, to compass that Design. And, Lastly, In order to make the Union the more close between him and the Elector, he desired his Sister in Marriage for the Dauphine his Son.
To these the Bavarian Ministers, after some Deliberation, made the following Answer: That as to their Elector, and the Lady offered him, they were yet too young to speak of their Marriage; That the Elector was very well contented with the Estates and Honours he possessed, and had no Design of increa∣sing them; But as to the rest, they were ready to enter into a Ne∣gotiation concerning a Treaty of Marriage between the Dau∣phine and their Princess. Which Resolutions, tho' they were not very pleasing to the French Court, yet the Treaty went on, and was at last concluded, and the Marriage firmly consummated, though it met with a considrable Obstruction from an Article which they would have stipulated therein; That in case of the Failure of an Heir Male of the Line of William, Duke of Ba∣varia, the Succession of the Dukedom should devolve to the Son of the Dauphine, by the Princess now to be married to him, if he had any. But this the Bavarian Ministers would by no means give way to, nor to any Pretensions the said Princess might hereafter make to any Right she might have to inherit any Part of the Goods,Dauphine married to the Prince of Bavaria. or Estates of the Elector her Father, but that she must make an entire Renunciation of the same upon this Marriage. So that upon the whole, there did arise no visible Advantage to France from this Match at present, or, indeed, in the Consequence of it, but that she proved the Mo∣ther of 3 Princes, and then left the Dauphine a Widdower, to better his Country by some new Alliance, towards which hi∣therto there have been no forward Paces made, whatever the Talk of the World has been in that particular. I have been so particular in inserting most of the material Articles of the Peace, concluded between all the contending Parties at Nimeguen, that I shall always refer the Reader to them in the Series of this Discourse, in all Things he meets with relating to any of them by way of Infringement, or otherwise, without any further Recapitulation. And first you shall hear how far the Emperor and Empire have thought themselves ag∣grieved, the former having by several Letters and Memorials acquainted the Diet at Ratisbone,The Empe∣ror's Memo∣rial to the Diet, at Ra∣tisbone, con∣cerning the French In∣fractions. that the French had already, (and this was but in Feb. 1680. N. S.) contravened the Peace in several Particulars: As, 1. By continuing their Troops in the Empire. 2. Remaining possess'd of all Places they ought to evacuate. 3. By requiring Contributions. 4. By obliging the 10 Towns of Alsatia, to take a new Oath, thereby pretend∣ing a Sovereignty over them, erecting a new Court of Appeals, and forbidding any Address to be made to the Imperial Cham∣ber at Spire. 5. By requiring an Oath from the Vassals and Nobles of Alsace. 6. By setting up Pretensions upon the Vas∣salage of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, as likewise upon other Impe∣rial States and Countries. 7. By confiscating the Rents and Revenues of the Chapter of Strasburg. 8. By making new
Fortifications at Schlestadt and Huningen. 9. In not restoring of Mompelgard. 10. In slighting of Dacksburg. 11. In taking of Homburg and Bitsch. And Lastly, In many new Pretensions upon the City of Strasburg. The Diet, after long Delibera∣tion, came at last to the following Resolution,The Result of the Diet. That these Pro∣ceedings of the French were directly contrary to the Treaties of Westphalia and Nimeguen; and that therefore the Emperor should be intreated, by Letter or by Embassie, in the Name of himself and the Empire, to demand of the most Christian King Reparation for the same; and that, in the mean time, the French Ministers residing at the Imperial Court, and at Ratis∣bone, should be made acquainted with the Resolution of the Diet; And that it should be represented unto them for what concerned the two first Points, that they were directly contra∣ry to the 27th Article of the Treaty of Nimeguen, and the 1st, 2d, and 4th Articles of the Instrument afterwards Signed by the Embassadors for the executing of the said Treaty, which had been religiously observed by the Emperor; That the 3d Point was contrary to the 30th Article of the said Treaty, and the 8th Article of the said Instrument. That for what concerned the 4th Point, it was known, that the 3d Article of the Treaty of Munster, says, That the County of the Vpper and Lower Al∣sace, and the Lordship of Haguenau, should be yielded to France, with an express Exception of the 10 Imperial Towns, their Rights and Priviledges, and that the French King should pretend to no Superiority over them; and that, in pursuance of the Agreement made at Nuremburg, in 1650, Haguenaw, Landaw, and other of the said 10 Towns, were actually eva∣cuated by the French, without pretending then, and several Years afterwards, to any Sovereignty over the said Towns, or requiring any Oath of Fidelity from them: That afterward, in 1665, Complaints were made to that Diet, of the French setting up new Pretensions; whereupon Arbitrators had been chosen, both on the part of the Emperor and of France, ami∣cably to determine the same, who had been several Years em∣ployed in the said Work, and which was put an end to by the French possessing themselves of the said Towns, even before the War; That the Treaty of Nimeguen did confirm that of Westphalia, and consequently, that the said Towns ought to be restored to the Enjoyment of the Rights and Priviledges, which they stipulated for them: That for the 5th and 6th Points, they likewise directly contravened the said Treaties: That, as for the 7th, they expected further Information on it: As for the 8th, they could not imagine what Right the French had to fortifie Schlestadt, considering the Promises with relation to those Free Towns: For the 9th and 10th, That the French had acted notoriously contrary to the Westphalian and Nime∣guen Treaties: For the 11th, That Homburg, belonged to the
Count of Nassaw, as appeared by the Treaty of Osnalbrug: That as for what concerned Bitsoh, they expected further Informati∣on: And Lastly, They hoped the French King would not pre∣judice Strasburg in its Rights and Priviledges, and particular∣ly in that of fortifying Kiel, that was so necessary for its Se∣curity. But for all these Remonstrances, the French were  far from giving the proposed Satisfaction, that they began ery Day to enlarge their Limits in Alsatia, and set up a new Pretension upon Santerburg, belonging to the bishoprick of Spire; and Monsieur Verjus, the French Minister at Ratisbone, spake very big upon the Matter, which made Things very uneasie on that side at the present. And a Paper that was some time after printed, and dispersed in those Parts, containing several Con∣ditions offered, as was pretended by the French King, in case the Dauphine were chosen King of the Romans, did not lessen, you may be sure, the Apprehensions they had of Danger from that Quarter; the Contents of which Paper, were these that follow: That the most Christian King, and the Dauphine, his Son, would make good the Imperial Constitutions; That the Dau∣phine would bear all due Respect to the Emperor; That Bur∣gundy, Lorrain, the Lower and Upper Alace, the Bishopricks of Metz, Toul and Verdun, with other Lands and Places, should be restored to the Empire, and the City of Friburg to the Em∣peror: That 60000 Men should be maintained in Hungary, to be employed against the Turks, without any Charge to the Empire, which should only maintain a Body of 16000 Men; That all the Places which should be taken in Hungary, should be put into the Emperor's Hands; That a considerable Fleet should be employed against the Turks, towards the Darda∣nello's; That Two Universities should be erected in Germany, for the Use of the several Religions there; And Lastly, That the French King would renounce all Pretensions to the Lands possessed by Charles the Great. But what Effect soever these Proposals were like to have up∣on the Empire in general, the Elector Palatine felt the Effects of the French Arms about this time in particular; for they at∣tacked the Castle of Falkenberg,The Empire complain of France. and, after some small Re∣sistance, made themselves Masters of it: All which, with a great many more put together, made the Emperor and Empire put forth their Complaints in every Court, where there was any hopes of Relief: And particularly, the Emperor's Minister in Holland represented to the States-General; That, by Order of His Imperial Majesty, he was to acquaint them, that the Officers of the most Christian King had already seized a great part of the Territories of the Elector Palatine; and it was to be feared they would do the like by the rest of his Countries,
on Pretence of Dependances, and other Rights, which they took upon them to search Antiquity for, even to the Time of King Dagoberte That the Elector of Trier had already suffered the like Treatment: And that other Princes of the Empire were exposed to the same Dangers; and particularly the City of Strasburg; which being directly contrary to the Peace of Nimeguen, the Preservation whereof was not only necessary to the Tranquility of Germany, but likewise to the Good of that Republick, whose Interest was no less to have a good Barrier towards the Rhine, than towards Flanders; He therefore desi∣red, the said States would effectually employ their good Offices at the French Court, to the end those Contraventions might for ever cease, and be abolished. But whether the States thought it to no purpose to sollicite France on this behalf, since, after all the Caresses of the French King, upon their Motion to him of being easie with Spain, in respect to the Title of Duke of Burgandy, before-mentioned, and in his Saying, He should al∣ways have a very great Regard to what the States should desire of him; they met at last with so little Success, and Spain was for∣ced to demit her Right; or that they thought others more im∣mediately concerned than themselves, they took but little Care of it. But Germany was not the only Country that thought her self injured by the French Proceedings since the Peace; for the new Pretensions that were set up every Day, upon some Place or other in Flanders, made them very uneasie on that side also; and so much the more, because they were not in a Condition to hinder it, and right themselves: For, the French, in the Spring of this Year, not only possessed themselves of the Abbies Thiery and St. Gerard, with above 40 Villages in the Province of Namur, under Colour of their being Dependances upon Charlemont, lately yielded to them; but also of the Abby Molyn, and its Dependancies; obliging the Inhabitants those Places to swear Fealty to France, and threatning them, case of Refusal, with Military Execution. And the Princes Italy, however they might take it, had no less Reason to be alarm'd at the Extension of the French Dominions on their side than either Flanders or Germany; for now it was, after some∣time of Treaty, that the Duke of Mantua's Ratification, con∣cerning the giving up of Cassal into the French Hands, fo 4000000 of Livres, arrived; and that their Troops marched to take Possession of the Place. This was the State of Things abroad,Parliamen met. when the Parliament in England met, which was upon the 21st of Oct. and to who the King made a Speech, importing, That the several Proroga∣tions he had made, had been very advantageous to our Neighbours and very useful to him; For he had imployed that Time in makin an Alliance with Spain, suitable to that which he had a little befor made with the States of the United Provinces, and they also
with Spain, consisting of Mutual Obligations of Succour and De∣fence; That he desired Money of them for the Relief of Tangler, which had already ebhausted his Purse; That he would not have them meddle with the Succession of the Crown in the Right Line, but proceed in the Discovery of the Plot, and to the Trial of the Lords. As for the Alliance with Holland, I have already given you an Account of it; and, indeed, it was well managed, as well as a good Point gained, and deserved more Notice should have been taken of it by the Parliament; and, perhaps, they would have done it another time: But, as for the other with Spain, I can give you no Particulars of it; And for Tangier, there had been several Attacks made upon it this Year, and for some time past, and was chargeable enough to the King; But, of this we shall have Occasion to say something hereafter. And, as for the King's Sincerity in recommending to them the Prosecution of the Plot; That Man that considers the Transactions between the Prorogation of the last Parliament, and the Sitting of this, with the Methods that were used to stifle the real Plot, and to father a Sham one upon innocent Men, and yet believes the King to be in Earnest, has a large Faith, and much Good may do him with it. Then for his professing his Readiness to con∣cur with any new Remedies that should be proposed, that were consistent with preserving the Succession of the Crown in its due and legal Course of Descent, it implied no more than Let the Wolf be Shepherd, and let the Sheep make what Laws they please for their Preservation. For it was well known, the Duke was a Papist, whose Maxims are to keep no Faith with Hereticks. However, the House of Commons entred into Debates about this Matter, and there were many Expedients proposed, how the Established Government in Church and State could be pre∣served; yet none could be found practicable, in case the Duke succeeded: So that the Country Party moved, that the Court Party should propound their Expedients in the Case; but they either could not, or else had no Instructions from the Court to warrant such Expedients, as might be proposed by them. Mat∣ters being thus at a stand, in respect to the Securing the Pro∣testant Religion, the House of Commons at last could think of no other Way to effect it, than by bringing in a Bill for the to∣tal Exclusion of the Duke of York from the Crown; which, af∣ter several Debates upon it, they passed on the 11th of Nov. And of which, that you may the better comprehend the Mean∣ing, I have here subjoined a Copy. WHereas James,The Bill of Exclusion. Duke of York, is notoriously known to have been perverted from the Protestant to the Po∣pish Religion, whereby not only great Encouragement hath been given to the Popish Party, to enter into, and carry on most Devilish and Horrid Plots and Conspiracies, for the De∣struction
of his Majesty's Sacred Person and Government, and and for the Extirpation of the true Protestant Religion: But also if the said Duke should succeed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, nothing is more manifest than that the total Change of Religion within these Kingdoms would ensue. For the Preservation thereof, be it Enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by, and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said James, Duke of York, shall be, and is by the Authority of this present Parliament, Excluded, and made for ever uncapable to Inherit, Possess, or Enjoy the Imperial Crown of this Realm, and of the Kingdoms of Ireland, and the Dominions and Territories of them, or either of them belonging, or to Have, Exercise, or Enjoy any Dominion, Power, Jurisdiction, or Authority in the said Kingdoms, Do∣minions, or any of them. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if the said James, Duke of York, shall at any time hereafter Challenge, Claim, or Attempt to Possess or Enjoy, or shall take upon him to Use or Exercise any Dominion, or Power, or Authority, or Jurisdiction within the said Kingdoms or Dominions, or any of them, as King or Chief Magistrate of the same, that then he, the said James, Duke of York, for every such Offence, shall be deemed and adjudged Guilty of High-Treason; and shall suffer the Pains, Penalties, and Forfeitures, as in Case of High-Treason. And further, That if any Person or Persons whatsoever shall assist or maintain, abet, or willingly adhere unto the said James, Duke of York, in such Challenge, Claim, or Attempt, or shall of themselves attempt, or endeavour to put, or bring the said James, Duke of York, into the Possession, or Exercise of any Legal Power, Jurisdiction, or Authority, within the King∣doms and Dominions aforesaid; or shall by Writing, or Preach∣ing, advisedly Publish, Maintain, or Declare, that he hath any Right, Title, or Authority to the Office of King, or Chief Magistrate of the Kingdoms and Dominions aforesaid, that then every such Person shall be Deemed and Adjudged Guil∣ty of High-Treason, and that he suffer and undergo the Pains, Penalties, and Forfeitures aforesaid. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the said James, Duke of York, shall not at any time from and after the 5th of Nov. 1680, return, or come into, or within any of the Kingdoms or Dominions aforesaid, and then he the said James, Duke of York, shall be Deemed and Adjudged Guilty of High-Treason; and shall suffer the Pains, Penalties, and Forfeitures, as in Case of High-Treason. And further, That if any Person or Persons whatsoever shall be aiding or assisting unto such Return of the said James, Duke of York,
that then every such Person shall be Deemed and Adjudged Guilty of High-Treason, and shall suffer as in Cases of High-Treason. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the said James, Duke of York, or any other Person being Guil∣ty of any of the Treasons aforesaid, shall not be capable of, or receive Benefit by any Pardon otherwise than by Act of Parlia∣ment, wherein they shall be particularly named; And that no Noli prosequi, or Order to stay Proceedings, shall be received, or allowed in, or upon any Indictment for any of the Offences mentioned in this Act. And be it further Enacted and Declared, and it is hereby Enacted and Declared, That it shall, and may be lawful to, and for any Magistrates, Officers, and other Subjects whatsoever of these Kingdoms and Dominions aforesaid; And they are hereby enjoined and required to Apprehend and Secure the said James, Duke of York, and any other Person offending in any of the Premisses, and with him or them, in case of Resi∣stance, to fight, and him or them by force to subdue: For all which actings, and for so doing, they are, and shall be by Vir∣tue of this Act, saved harmless and indemnified. Provided, and it is hereby declared, That nothing in this Act contained, shall be construed, deemed, or adjudged to dis∣enable any other Person from Inheriting and Enjoying the Im∣perial Crown of the Realms and Dominions aforesaid (other than the said James, Duke of York) but that in Case the said James, Duke of York, should survive his now Majesty, and the Heirs of his Majesty's Body, the said Imperial Crown shall descend to, and be enjoyed by such Person or Persons succes∣sorily, during the Life of the said James, Duke of York, as should have Inherited and Enjoyed the same, in case the said James, Duke of York, were naturally dead, any Thing con∣tained in this Act to the Contrary notwithstanding. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That, during the Life of the said James, Duke of York, this Act shall be given a Charge at every Assizes, and General Sessions of the Peace, within the Kingdoms, Dominions and Territories aforesaid; and also shall be openly Read in every Cathedral Church, and Parish Church and Chappels, within the aforesaid Kingdoms, Dominions and Territories, by the respective Parsons, Vicars, Curates, and Readers thereof, who are hereby required immediately after Divine Service in the Forenoon, to Read the same twice in every Year; That is to say, on the 25th of Dec. and upon Easter-day, during the Life of the said James, Duke of York.
But the Lords Rancounter to the Commons in this Bill (tho' they made a Sift upon the others Impeachment, to Try and Sentence William,The Bill thrown out of the House of Lords. Lord Viscount Stafford to Death, for the Popish Conspiracy, (who, on the 7th of Dec. was executed accordingly.) For, after the Reading it the First time in the Upper-House, the Question being put, Whether it should be read the Second time, it was resolved in the Negative by above a double Majority of Votes, and so this great Affair dropp'd. The Commons imployed much of their Time to prosecute and impeach all those that had countenanced the Popish Plot,The Parlia∣ment prose∣cute the Ab∣horrers of Petitioning. or were Abhorrers of Petitioning the King for the Meeting of the Parliament, in the several Prorogations of it, and voted, That it ever had been the undoubted Right of the Subjects of England, to Petition the King for the Calling and Sitting of Parliaments, and Redress of Grievances. And that to traduce such Petitioning as a Violation of Duty, and to represent the same to his Majesty, as Tumultuous and Seditious, was to betray the Liberty of the Subject, and contributed to the Designs of subverting the ancient Legal Constitutions of the Kingdom of England, and introducing Arbitrary Power. The first that fell under their Lash, was Sir Francis Withens (since a Judge) a Mem∣ber then of their own House, whom they voted to be a Be∣trayer of the undoubted Rights of the Subjects of England; and for that his high Crime, expelled him the House, recei∣ving first the Sentence at the Bar, upon his Marrow-bones. Sir George Jefferys was the next, then Recorder of London; who for the present, by Virtue of the House's Address to the King, for that End, was put out of all publick Offices; tho' we have seen him since act the Tyrant in the highest Station, the late King, his good Master, could advance him to, but at last being left in the Lurch by him, was found in a Seaman's Habit at Wapping, and died in the Tower, because he had not Cou∣rage enough to live a little longer to be hang'd. Several others were censured upon the like Account; and, among the rest, the House voted, That it was a sufficient Ground for them to proceed against Sir Thomas Jones, one of the Judges of the King's Bench, and Sir Richard Westone, a Baron of the Ex∣chequer, for high Crimes and Misdemeanors, because they had advised, and were assisting to draw up a Proclamation against Petitioning for the Sitting of the Parliament. The like was passed against Sir Francis North, Chief Justice of the Common-Pleas, for the same; who, for murdering poor Stephen Colledge, under Colour of Law, at Oxford, had the Great Seal of England committed to his Custody, and therewith the Care of the King's Conscience, who had none at all of his own. All this while we hear nothing of the King's Business, which was, to get Money for the Preservation of Tangier, and Per∣fecting the Alliance made with Spain; But the Commons had
Three Reasons why they would not comply with his Majesty in his first Demand: One was, for that the State of the Nation was such at that time, that their giving any Money for that End, might augment the Strength of the Popish Party, and further endanger the Nation's Safety. Another was, Seeing there were several Regiments, besides Guards in England then in Pay, they might be transported to Tangier with little Charge, and be maintain'd there as cheap as at Home; which Two Reasons they clench'd with this Third, That that Garrison was the Nur∣sery of Popish Officers and Soldiers. And if Things went ill with the King on this Head, he is like to fare no better with the other. For the House had as many Reasons for not gi∣ving him Money for the Alliance of Mutual Obligations of Suc∣cour and Defence, which he pretended to have made with Spain; For first, they seemed to be jealous of the King's Sin∣cerity therein; and the more, because he had not declared to them what manner of Alliance that was, and that it might be more to the Prejudice than Benefit of the Kingdom; or if it should have been to the Advantage of it, they could have no more Assurance of the Performance, than they had of the Triple League; That which was made with the Prince of Orange when he was in England; Or that between the King and States of Holland, by Mr. Hyde, on the King's Part, which were all bro∣ken almost as soon as made. Besides, it was impossible any great Benefit should arise to England and Spain by such an Al∣liance; For if all Christendom, after the separate Peace made by the Dutch at Nimeguen, could not uphold Spain and the Spa∣nish Netherlands, from falling under the Dominion of France, how could the King, in the feeble and distracted State of the Nation, be in a Condition to support it without them? Add to this, the Unreasonableness of giving Money upon such an Account; For, tho' the Kings of England have frequently de∣manded Supplies for maintaining vast Wars, yet never any one of them before, demanded Supplies for making Alliances. And, indeed, whatever Alliance the King had made with Spain, it will be found before his Reign has spun out, that it was very ill performed on his part. And if the Commons were not a little mortified at the Proceedings of the Lords, and of the Court, in respect to the Bill of Exclusion, the King could not be well pleased (to be sure) with the Methods they took to an∣swer his Demands of a present Supply, in the ordinary way; but was undoubtedly much more nettled at their Resolutions to hinder him from being relieved by extraordinary Methods afterwards: For, the House considering the weak and dange∣rous Condition of the Nation, as well by the Debt the King had contracted by shutting up of the Exchequer, as by his squandering away almost all the ancient Revenues of the Crown, did, in order to prevent the like upon the Revenue
settled upon the King since his Restoration, on the 17th of Jan. resolve, 1. That whosoever should lend,The Resolu∣tion of the Commons against lend∣ing the King Money. or cause to be lent by way of Advance, any Money upon the Branches of the King's Revenue arising by Custom, Excise, or Hearth-money, should be ad∣judged an Hinderer of the Sitting of Parlaiment, and be re∣sponsible for the same. 2. That whosoever should buy any Tally, or Anticipation upon any part of the King's Revenue, or whosoever should pay such Tally hereafter to be struck, should be adjudged to hinder the Sittings of Parliaments, and be responsible there∣fore in Parliament. Things being brought to this desperate pass between them, without any visible Hopes of a better Understanding, the Thoughts of the Court now began to think of a Prorogation or Dissolution; and the Commons were, it seems, aware of it; For on Monday, Jan. the 10th, before the Usher of the Black-Rod came into the House, to command their Attendance on the King in the House of Lords, they had resolved, That who∣soever advised the King to prorogue this Parliament, to any Purpose than in order to the Passing of a Bill for the Exclusion of James, Duke of York, was a Betrayer of the King, the Pro∣testant Religion, and of the Kingdom of England, a Promoter of the French Interest, and a Pensioner to France; Which was no sooner done, but they were Prorogued to the 20th of Jan. and upon the 18th he Dissolved them; And so ended this Sessi∣ons of Parliament, with which, having run out a few Days into the new Year, we conclude the Year 1680, only we shall note first two or three Particulars. On the 30th of July,The Earl of Ossory's Death. this Year, died at Whitehall, the Right and truly Honourable Thomas, Earl of Ossory, Son and Heir ap∣parent to his Grace the Duke of Ormond, after some few Days sickness, of a violent Feaver, whose Heroick Bravery, and for∣ward Zeal to serve his King and Country on all commendable Occasions, was manifested by many brave and generous Acti∣ons; Which, as they made him be honoured and esteemed by all, while living, made him, dying, to be as generally lamen∣ted. He was the Father of his Grace the present Duke of Ormond, who, to his great Glory, has been so far from degene∣rating from him, that he hath to the Height express'd his Ver∣tues and Excellencies, both in Peace and Way; and is a Person that deserves as much, and if all Circumstances be considered, a great deal more of his Country,The Death of the E∣lectors of Saxony and Palatine. than any other Nobleman whatsoever. Sept. following was remarkable for the Death of Two Electors of the Empire, viz. on the 2d, John George, Duke of Saxony, dying at Friburg, after a long Indisposition, in the
68th▪ Year of his Age, leaving only one Son by his Wife Mag∣daline Sibille of Brandenburg Ansbach, John George the Third of that Name, who succeeded him in his Dominions and Digni∣ties: And but 5 Days after departed also this Life, Charles Lovis, Count Palatine of the Rhine, suddenly, in the Way be∣tween Manheim and Frankendal, after a light Indisposition of 2 or 3 Days: he was 63 Years old, and left by his Wife Char∣lotte, Daughter of William Landgrave of Hesse, one Son, Charles, then in England, and to whom an Express was immediately dis∣patch'd to give him advice of his Father's Death, and a Daughter Charlotte, Elizabeth Wife to the now Duke of Orleans. And to∣wards the middle of Nov. appeared a Comet, with a prodigi∣ous Stream of Light in the West; The Star from which the Blaze proceeded, was but small, and when first discovered, seemed to be not much above the Horizon, but every Night afterward it appeared higher and higher in the Beginning of the Night, and consequently setting latter and latter, its Mag∣nitude and Lustre also proportionably decaying. The Nation, at the Dissolution of the last Parliament, up∣on the 18th of Jan. (as already mentioned) were strangely ama∣zed, and began now in general to be very doubtful of any good Issue in their common Concerns, which the Court was not una∣ware of; and therefore, in some measure, to allay Things, the King summoned another to meet on the 21st of March fol∣lowing at Oxford; which was no sooner publickly known, but it rather heightned than alleviated the Jealousies of the more in∣telligent Persons, that there might be some hidden Design nou∣rished in the Court, that might have dangerous Influences, both upon the Nation and Parliament. Whereupon several of the Nobility, after mature Consideration of the Matter, resol∣ved to petition the King against the Meeting of the Parlia∣ment at the forementioned Place; which Petition was delivered by the Earl of Essex, with which he made a short pithy Speech, and both which we have hereunto subjoined. May it please your Majesty, THE Lords here present,The Earl of Essex's Speech to the King. together with divers others of the Peers of the Realm, taking notice, that by the late Proclama∣tion Your Majesty has declared an Intention of calling a Parliament at Oxford; and observing from History and Records, how unfor∣tunate many Assemblies have been, when called at a Place remote from the Capital City; as particularly, the Congress in King Henry the II's Time at Clarendon; 3 several Parliaments at Oxford in Henry the III's Time; and at Coventry in Henry the VI's Time; with divers others, which have proved fatal to those Kings, and have been followed with great Mischief on the whole Kingdom: And considering the present Posture of Affairs, the many Jealousies and Discontents that are among the People, they have great Cause
to apprehend, that the Consequences of a Parliament now at Ox∣ford may be as fatal to Your Majesty, and the Nation, as those others mentioned, have been to them Reigning Kings: And therefore we do conceive, that we cannot answer it to God, to Your Ma∣jesty, or to the People, if we, being Peers of the Realm, should not on so important an Occasion humbly offer our Advice to Your Ma∣jesty, that if possible Your Majesty may be prevailed with to alter this (as we apprehend) reasonable Resolution, the Grounds and Reasons of our Opinions are contained in this our Petition, which we humbly present to Your Majesty. TO THE KING'S most Excellent MAJESTY. The Humble PETITION and ADVICE of the Lords undernamed, Peers of the Realm. Humbly Sheweth, THAT,The Lords Petition to the King. whereas Your Majesty hath been pleased, by di∣vers Speeches and Passages to Your Houses of Parlia∣ment, rightly to represent to them the Dangers that threat∣ned Your Majesty's Person, and the whole Kingdom, from the mischievous and wicked Plots of the Papists, and the sud∣dain Growth of a Power, unto which no Stop or Remedy could be provided, unless it were by Parliament, and an Uni∣on of Your Majesty's Protestant Subjects in one Mind and one Interest. And the Lord-Chancellor, in pursuance of your Majesty's Commands, having more at large demonstrated the said Dan∣gers to be as great, as we in the midst of our Fears, could ima∣gine them; and so pressing, that our Liberties, Religion, Lives, and the whole Kingdom, would be certainly lost, if a speedy Provision were not made against them. And Your Majesty, on the 21st of Apr. 1679, having cal∣led unto Your Council many Honourable and Worthy Per∣sons, and declared to them, and the whole Kingdom, that being sensible of the evil Effects of a Single Ministry, or Pri∣vate Advice, or Foreign Committee, for the general Directi∣on of Your Affairs, Your Majesty would, for the future, refer all Things unto the Council, and by the constant Advice of them, together with the frequent Use of Your Great Council the Parliament, Your Majesty had hereafter resolved to go∣vern the Kingdom, we began to hope we should see an End of our Miseries.
But to our unspeakable Grief and Sorrow, we soon found our Expectation frustrated, the Parliament then subsisting was Prorogued and Dissolved, before it could perfect what was in∣tended for our Relief and Security; and though another was thereupon called, yet by the many Prorogations, it was put off till the 21st of Oct. past; and notwithstanding Your Ma∣jesty was then again pleased to acknowledge, that neither Your Majesty's Person nor the Kingdom should be safe, till the Matter of the Plot was gone through, it was unexpectedly Prorogued on the 10th of this Month, before any sufficient Order could be taken therein, all their just and pious Endea∣vours to save the Nation, were overthrown, the good Bills they had been industriously preparing, to unite all Your Ma∣jesty's Protestant Subjects brought to nought, the Discovery of the Irish Plot stifled, the Witnesses that came in frequently, more fully to declare that both of England and Ireland dis∣couraged; those Foreign Kingdoms and States, who by a hap∣py Conjunction with us, might give a Check to the French Power, disheartned even to such a Despair of their own Secu∣rity against the growing Greatness of that Monarch, as we fear may induce them to take new Resolutions, and, per∣haps, such as may be fatal to us; the Strength of our Ene∣mies, both at Home and Abroad increased, and our selves left in the utmost Danger of seeing our selves brought into utter Desolation. In these Extremities we had nothing under God, to com∣fort us, but the Hopes that Your Majesty (being touched with the Groans of Your perishing People) would have suffered Your Parliament to have met at the Day unto which it was Prorogued, and that no further Interruption should have been given to their Proceedings, in order to the saving of the Na∣tion, yet that failed us too: But when we heard that Your Majesty, by the private Suggestion of some wicked Persons, Favourers of Popery, Promoters of French Designs, and Ene∣mies to Your Majesty and the Kingdom, (without the Advice, and, as we have good Reason to believe, against the Opinion even of Your Privy-Council) had been prevailed with to Dis∣solve it, and to call another to meet at Oxford, where neither Lords nor Commons can be in Safety, but will be daily expo∣sed to the Sword of the Papists and their Adherents, of whom too many are crept into Your Majesty's Guards, the Liberty of speaking according to their Consciences will be thereby de∣stroyed, and the Validity of all their Acts and Proceedings consisting in it, left disputable, the Streightness of the Place no way admits of such a Concourse of Persons as now fol∣lows every Parliament; the Witnesses that are necessary to give Evidence▪ against the Popish Lords, such Judges, or o∣thers, whom the Commons have Impeached, or had resol∣ved
to Impeach, can neither bear the Charge of going thi∣ther, nor trust themselves under the Protection of a Parlia∣ment, that is it self evidently under the Power of Guards and Soldiers. The Premises consider'd, we Your Majesty's Petitioners, out of just Abhorrence of such a dangerous and pernicious Council, (which the Authors have not dared to avow) and the direful Apprehensions of the Calamities and Miseries that may ensue thereupon, do make it our most humble Prayer and Advice, That the Parliament may not Sit at a Place, where it cannot be able to act with that Freedom which is necessary, and especially to give unto their Acts and Proceedings that Authority which they ought to have amongst the People, and have ever had, unless impaired by some Awe upon them (of which there wants not Presidents;) and that Your Majesty would be graciously pleased to order it to Sit at Westminster, (it being the usual Place, and where they may consult and act with Safety and Freedom. And your Petitioners shall ever pray, &c. Montmouth, Kent, Huntington, Bedford, Salisbury, Clare, Stamford, Essex, Shaftsbury, Mordant, Evers, Paget, Gray, Herbert, Howard, Delamere. The Answer given by the King to this Petition is left Re∣corded no where, that I can find, but that he express'd his Dis∣pleasure at it by a Frown, was commonly reported in those Times; which was the more taken notice of, because of th kind Answers he was wont to give the other Party upon all Oc∣casions; and the greater Care that was taken in the Publica∣tion thereof, that the Nation might know it. But how loo soever he was in his Promises to the Parliament, you will find him steddy and unmovable in this of the Parliament's meeting at Oxford; and the Lords that had an Hand in this Petitio shall be remembred by him in their due Place. But we sha now leave this Matter, and see a little what was done betwee the last and 3d Westminster Parliament of this King's Reig and the meeting of this at Oxford. Though the Meal-T Plot, whereof we have already given you an Hint, meet wit such ill Success; yet the indefatigable Zeal of a Son of Sir Ed Fitz-Harris, an Irish Papist, and consequently very fit (as really was) to be a Correspondent with the Dutchess of Por mouth, her Woman Mrs. Wall, and the French Embassado Confessor, (the first of which had several times supplied hi with Money, and at one time particularly with 250 l.)
such, that happening to come acquainted with one Everard be∣yond Sea, where they were both in the French King's Service, he did about the Beginning of Feb. after the Parliament was Dissolved, renew his said Acquaintance with Everard, and re∣presented to him the Advantages he might have in forsaking the English Interest, and ingratiating himself into the French and Popish one; and that it would be very conductive to that In∣terest, if he would make a Pamphlet that reflected upon the King. To this, the other gave not a clear Consent; yet Fitz-Harris, upon the 21st of Feb. gave him some Heads by Word of Mouth to draw up such a Pamphlet: Which Procedure of his made Everard acquaint several withal, and particularly one Mr. Smith, and Sir William Waller, whom he engaged, in a concealed Manner, to be at a Place appointed to hear the fur∣ther Discourse between them, which was next Day, and whi∣ther the former came, where he heard Fitz-Harris give Eve∣rard Instructions to this Purpose: That the King and Royal Family should be traduced, as being Papists, and arbitrarily affected from the Beginning; That King Charles I. had an Hand in the Irish Rebellion; and that Charles II. did counte∣nance the same, by preferring Fitz-Gerrald, Fitz-Patrick, and Mount-Garret, who were engaged in the Irish Rebellion; That the Act, forbidding to call the King a Papist, was to stop Mens Mouths, when he should encline to further Popery; which ap∣peared by his adhering so closely to the Duke of York's Inte∣rests, and hindring him from being proceeded against by the Parliament; and hindring the Officers, put in by the Duke of York, to be turned out; and for that, the Privy-Councellors and Justices of the Peace, who were for the Protestant Inte∣rest, were turned out of all Places of Trust; That it was as much in the Power of the People, to depose a Popish Possessor, as a Popish Successor; and seeing there was no Hopes, the Par∣liament, when they met at Oxford, could do any Good, the People were bound to provide for themselves. This was no sooner ended, but they agreed to meet the next Day there again; And Everard sent Sir William Waller a Let∣ter to be present, secretly, and to whom Everard, upon his coming, gave 2 Copies of the Instructions abovesaid, which Sir William marked: Sooner after came Fitz-Harris, who en∣quiring of Everard what he had done; he answered, He had drawn 2 Copies of the Business, and prayed Fitz-Harris to see how he liked them: Who, upon perusal, altered one of them; yet thought it not full enough, but would have it fair wrote over for the French Embassador's Confessor. After this, Everard de∣sired him to give him Instructions in Writing; which Fitz-Harris did, and in which Paper he wrote this Passage, That it was in the Peoples Power to depose a Popish Possessor, as well as a Popish Successor; and other Treasonable Head, and left the same
with him, but came next Day again for a Copy fair writ out, which Everard delivered to him, who thereupon promised him a Recompence, which was to be the Entrance into the Business; And that he should be brought into the Cabal, where several Protestants and Parliament-Men were to give an Account to the French Embassador of what was transacted. But before Fitz-Harris was to receive the Libel, he was to go to my Lord Howard of Escrick, between whom, before this, and the Dutchess of Portsmouth, he had carried several Messages, and went a great way to bring my Lord over to the Court-Interest. But for the Reader's farther Satisfaction, and for fear the Libel it self might be lost, I shall adventure to give it place here. TREASON in GRAIN: That most Traiterous Paper, or Libel of Fitz-Harris; whereby he design'd to raise a Rebellion amongst us, the better to make Way for a French Invasion, and our utter Destruction, as it was Read in both Houses of Parliament at Oxford, and upon which the House of Commons Impeached him of High-Treason; Falsly and Malitiously called by him, The True English-man speaking plain English; in a Letter from a Friend to a Friend. I Thank you for the Character of a Popish Successor,Fitz-Harris his Libel. which you sent me, wherein our just Fears, and the Grounds of them, are justly set out. But I am in a greater Fear of the present Possessor; Why do we frighten our selves about the Evil that is to come, not looking to that which is at hand? We would cut off the Budding Weeds, and let the Poysonous Root lie still; we would stop the Channel of our Evils, and let the Fountain still run: My Meaning is this, Can Py∣lades Know and Act all these bloody Conspiracies, and not im∣part them to his dear Orestes? if James be Conscious and Guilty, Charles is so too: Believe me, these Two Brethren in Iniquity, they are in Confederacy with Pope and French, to introduce Popery and Arbitrary Government, as all their Acti∣ons demonstrate: The Parliament, Magna Charta, and Li∣berty of the Subject are as heavy Yoaks, which they would cast off to be as Absolute as their Br. of France; and if this can be proved to be their only Aim and Endeavour, why should not every True Britain be a Quaker thus far? Let the English rise, and move as one Man to Self-defence, to open Action, and fling off their intolerable Riders. Blow the Trumpet,
stand on your Guard, and withstand them as Bears and Ty∣gers. And since there can be no Trust given to this goodly Couple of Popish Brethren, nor no Relief expected from a Parliament; Trust to your Swords, in Defence of your Lives, Laws, Religion and Properties, like the stout Earl of Old, who told a King, That if he could not be defended by Magna Charta, he would be relieved by Longa Spada. Yet to convince the World, that this Scottish Race is Cor∣rupt, Root and Branch, and Popish from the very Beginning, be pleas'd to consider these Reasons following: The Grandfather of these Men, James the Scot, was of no Religion at the Bottom, but entred by a Pretence of a Sham-Plot of the Papists against his Life, whilst really he collogued with the Popish Party under-hand; his Mother, his Kindred, and Companions were French and Papists; when he came in∣to England, he wrote to the Pope, with great Submission, yet afterwards thinking it for his Purpose to Cajole the Parlia∣ment, and write against the Pope and Cardinals, he sends a Scot's Bird to blind the Eyes of the Vatican Keeper with Mo∣ney, and to steal his Letters from off the Roman File, and then he crows as boldly as an unsuspected Harlot, for the Protestant Religion and Interest. That Man's Son, Charles the First, held a Secret Correspon∣dency with the Pope, calling him his Dear and Holy Father, as is to be seen in his Letters recorded in Rushworth's Collecti∣ons: Did he not countenance and promote the Rebellion in Ire∣land, as the Irish Grandees, and his very Commissions testifie and declare? Was there not a Popish Plot, and an Universal Conspiracy of the Papists discovered to him, and his Confessor Laud? And did they not piously stifle it, left they should have discovered the Nakedness of their Mother-Church? Whilst that goodly Protestant Prince pretended to relieve the poor besieged Protestants at Rochel, by his Confident Buckingham. Did he not hold Correspondence with the French Cardinal, how to betray them for a Sum of Money (which his Obstinacy with his Parliament made him stand in need of?) But they who so ill approved themselves to be Heads of the Protestant Church, Charles and Laud, Did they not loose their own Heads by a manifest Judgment of God? And was not the false Heart of their Emissary Buckingham, found out by an As∣sassine's Knife? But to come nearer to our Purpose, these Two goodly Imps of our Days are stark naught; arrived at the Heighth of Wickedness, and of professed Arbitrariness and Popery. As for James, he was a Papist whilst he had a Regiment in the French, and afterwards in the Spanish Service beyond Seas. And, for Charles, he was reported, e're he came into England,
to have been reconciled to the Church of Rome, in one of the French King's Country-Houses; and since they came in, How have they wheedled and played Fast and Loose, in their Pro∣fession of Religion, as Occasion and their Affairs requir'd? Have they not all along maintained Secret Correspondence with France and Rome? As Coleman's Letters may sufficiently instruct such, who have not seen more Secret Memoirs. But let us come to Examine their Actions, which are a bet∣ter Proof of their Hearts; Were not the Duke's Servants and Confidents all Papists? Witness his Talbots, Patricks, and o∣ther Irish Teagues; Were not the Duke, and such of his Crea∣tures as were known Papists, promoted to all Publick Offices of Trust, both at Sea and Land? Witness Bellasis, now a Traytor in the Tower; Did not James by Coleman, Throgmor∣ton, and others, hold open Correspondence with the Pope and Cardinals? And could Charles be ignorant of all this? Nay, he lik'd all so well, that he hardly employed any about him but Papists, as Clifford, whom he made Treasurer; or em∣ployed any Abroad but Persons of the same Stamp; witness Godolphin, whom he sent Embassador into Spain, as he did others elsewhere? What more obvious than that, though the Duke's Treachery against the Kingdom and Protestant Religion, be fully made out, and the People and Parliament seek to bring him to a Legal Tryal, yet Charles obstructs Ju∣stice, and will not suffer it? How can this be, but that he is joyned in Will and Deed in all the Duke's Villanies; and that he is afraid to be discovered and found out to be a Papist, and a Betrayer of his People and the Protestant Religion? If he was heartily concerned for our Religion, would he not oppose a Popish Successor, who will infallibly overthrow it? Can there be any Thing more evident, than that he continues the Duke's Adherents, and those who were advanced by him, in all Offices of Trust? And hath he not turn'd out of his Coun∣cel the most zealous Protestants, such as Shaftsbury, Essex and others, and introduced in their Rooms other meer Tools, or those that are Popishly and Arbitrarily affected? Hath he not modell'd all the Sheriffs and Justices throughout England in Subserviency to a Popish Design? Was not Sir William Waller and Dr. Chamberlain, and divers others, turn'd out of the Commission in and about London, meerly for being zealous Prosecutors of Priests and Papists? Doth not Charles all he can to hinder the further Detection of the Popish Plot? And doth he not to his utmost discountenance the Discoverers of it, and suffer them to want Bread? And doth he not in the mean time plentifully encourage and reward Fitz-Gerald, and all the Sham-plotters? Whereas Dangerfield had 8 l. a Week, whilst a Forger of Plots against the Protestants, he is cast off with scorn, and in danger of his Life, since he laid open the
Popish Engineers. Is not Ch. so much in love with his Popish Irish Rebes (therein treading in his Father's Steps) that he promotes Montgarret, Carlingford, Fitz-Patrick and others, who were the Heads of the Rebellion, to Honours and Prefer∣ment, though Charles took the Covenant, and a Coronation-Oath, to preserve the Protestant Religion, yet hath he not palpably broken them? He made large Promises and Protesta∣tions at Breda, for the allowing a perpetual Liberty of Con∣science to Non-conforming Protestants, but he soon forgot them all: To what End was the Act which was made soon af∣ter his Restoration, prohibiting any to call him Papist, or to say he was Popishly enclin'd, and rendring such as should of∣fend, guilty of a Praemunire, but to stop the Peoples Mouths, whenever he should act any Thing in Favour of Popery, as he was then resolved to do? Is it not manifest therefore, that Scotch Oaths, Breda Pro∣mises, Protestant Profession, Liberty of Conscience, War with France, saving of Flanders, is all in Jest, to delude Protestant Subjects? Is it not apparent, that breaking of Leagues, Dutch Wars, Smyrna Fleet, French Measures to favour their Con∣quests, Loss of Ships, War in Christendom, Blood of Pro∣testants, reprieving of Popish Traytors, is all in Earnest, and done in favour of Popery? And are not his fair Speeches, his true Protestant Love to Parliaments just Rights, and English Liberties, his pretended Ignorance of the Plot, and his hang∣ing of Traytors to serve a Turn, but in meer Jest? Are not his great Debaucheries, his Whoring Courtiers, Popish Coun∣cils, Cheating Rogues, Hellish Plottings, his saving of Tray∣tors, his French Pensioners, his Nests of Whores, and Swarms of Bastards, his Macks, his Cut-Throats, his horrid Murder∣rers, his Burning of London, and the Provost's House too, his Sham-plotting, his suborn'd Villains, his Popish Officers by Sea and Land, his Strugglings for a Popish Successor, his A∣greements with France, his frequent Dissolutions of Parlia∣ments, his buying of Voices, his false Returns, all of them Designs to ruine us in good Earnest, and in favour of Arbi∣trary Government? And is it not in order to this blessed End, that you see none countenanced by Charles and James, but Church Papists, betraying Bishops, tantivy Abhorrers, bark∣ing Touzers, Popish Scriblers to deceive the People, and six the Popish Successors illegal Title? Are not Jesuits Councels, French Assistance to conquer Ireland, subdue Scotland, win Flanders, beat the Dutch, get their Shipping, be Masters of the Seas? And are not forcing a Rebellion, the letting the Plot go on, the Endeavouring to retrieve the Popish Cause by getting a Popish Pentionary, abhorring Parliaments, who shall betray their Country, enslave Posterity, and destroy them∣selves at last, Means only to save a Popish Trayterous Succes∣sor,
and a present Popish Possessor? James and Charles are Brethren in Iniquity, corrupt both in Root and Branch, and who study to enslave England to a French and Romish Yoak, is not all this plain? Have you not Eyes, Sense or Feeling? Where is the Old English Noble Spirit? Are you become French Asses, to suffer any Load to be laid upon you? And therefore, if you can get no Remedy from this next Parliament (as certainly you will not;) and if Charles doth not repent and comply with it, then up all as one Man. O brave English Men, look to your own Defence e're it be too late; rouze up your Spirits, re∣member your Predecessors, remember how that the asserting of their Liberties, justified both by Success and Law, the War of the Barons against wicked Councellors, who misled the King; And will you now let that go which cost them so dear? How many oppressing Kings have been deposed in this Nati∣on, as appears in Records referr'd unto in that worthy Pa∣triot's History of the Succession: Were not Richard II. and Henry VI. both laid aside, not to mention others; and was there ever such a King as this of ours? Was not K. John de∣posed, for going about to embrace the Mahometan Religion, and for entring into a League with the K. of Morocco, to that Purpose? Though Mahometanism, and the King of Morocco, were no such Enemies to our Rights and Liberties, as Popery and the French King are. Is it not time then that all should be ready? Let the City of London stand by the Parliament, for the Maintaining of their Liberties and Religion in an ex∣tream Way, if Parliamentary Ways be not consented unto by the King, let the Counties be ready to enter into an Associa∣tion, as the County of York did in Henry VIII's Time. The Design you may see was to be carried on in the Name of the Non-conformists, and fixt upon them, and to be dis∣persed by the Peny-Post, to the Protesting Lords, and Leading Men in the House of Commons, who were immediately there∣upon to be taken up and searched. Everard affirmed, The Court had an Hand it, and that the King had given Fitz-Harris Money, and would give him more, if it had Success. And this is so much the more to be credited, since the King himself told Sheriff Cornish, That Fitz-Harris had, 3 Months before his Apprehension, been with im, and acquainted him he was in pur∣suit of a Plot, which very much related to His Majesty's Person and Government, &c. And that upon Sir William Waller's acquaint∣ing the King with the Particulars he had taken, while he was concealed, as aforesaid; tho' he thanked him for it, and com∣manded Secretary Jenkins to issue out a Warrant for the Ap∣prehension of Fitz-Harris, and that Sir William should take Care of the Execution of it; Yet he was no sooner gone, but Sir Wil∣liam said, He was informed by 2 worthy Gentlemen, That the King
was highly offended with him, saying, He had broken all his Mea∣sures; and that he would one Way or other have him taken off. Fitz-Harris, however, was soon after taken, and committed to Newgate, where being examined by Sir Robert Clayton, and Sheriff Cornish, he discovered a Disposition, and at length a Willingness to discover the whole Design the next Day after. But to prevent it, in all appearance, he was that Day removed into the Tower. But while this hopeful Business was thus jumbled up, the Time spun out, and the 21st of March came, when the Parlia∣ment met at Oxford, and of which the Members of the Com∣mons were generally the same as the last Parliament; and those that were not so, were of the same Kidney as the others had been; so that their Proceedings began where the last Parlia∣ment left off. They far, indeed, but 7 Days, and of them the Lower House spent the first 3, in choosing their Speaker, and confirming him, and taking the Oaths, as the Laws directed; But in that little time, they had these 4 Considerations before them; 1. The preparing a Bill to prevent the Duke of York's succeeding to the Crown. The 2d was to take the Bill of the Re∣peal of the Act of the 35th of Eliz. out of the House of Lords. A 3d was an Enquiry into Fitz-Harris his Business: And the 4th was to prosecute the Popish Lords in the Tower. But this was more Work by a great deal, than the stinted Opportunity of 4 Days would admit a Dispatch of. However, upon Friday the 25th of Mar. after that the House had been some time up∣on the Debate of Fitz-Harris's Concern; and that one of the Members had reported, That he remembred that one Hubert having confess'd, he had fired the City of London; and that the House then sitting, having resolved thereupon to examine him, they were prevented by his being hanged next Morning before they met; And that there having been also a Design to try the Lords in the Tower, by way of Indictment, the House had prevented the same by exhibiting general Impeachments against them with that Success, that the Lords were never try∣ed upon Indictments, and the Judges had given their Opinion, they could not; This moved them that same Day, to order an Impeachment against Fitz-Harris; and appointed Sir Lionel Jenkins to carry it up to the House of Lords, who at first refu∣sed it, saying, That his being sent upon that Message, reflected up∣on the King his Master, and let them do what they would, he would not go. But several of the Members having moved thereupon to call him to the Bar of the House; and divers others in their Speeches aggravating highly his Offence, he at last relented, and carried the Impeachment to the House of Lords, but the Lords threw it out; At which the Commons next Day, which was Saturday the 26th, were so nettled, that they ran very high in their Debates upon it, ripping up several sharp Things
against the Lords Proceedings herein; So that at last it was moved, That if any Judge, Justice, or Jury proceeded upon Fitz-Harris, and that he were found guilty, that the House would declare them guilty of his Murder, and Betrayers of the Rights of the Commons of England. To this it was add∣ed, upon the Motion of Sir William Jones, or that any inferiour Court should proceed, &c. which was passed; But what little Notice was taken hereof, you may hear by and by. The House hereupon adjourned to Monday Morning, March 27. when the King coming suddenly and unexpectly into the House of Peers,The Oxford Parliament dissolved. dissolved the Parliament, and immediately took Coach, and made as hard as he could for Windsor, leaving both Houses in a grand Amazement, and the City of Oxford in an Hubbub. Sir William Jones in his just and modest Vindication of this, and the last Parliament at Westminster, says, The Peers at Oxford were wholly ignorant of the Council, and that they never thought of a Dissolution, till they heard the same pronounced. Yet it is observable,The King's Declaration after the Dissolution of the Par∣liament. that the Dutchess of Mazarine published the News at St. James's many Hours before the same was done. But if the Nation, as well as the Parliament and City of Oxford, were amazed at this Dissolution, and the Manner thereof, they were no less so with the King's Declaration that followed; the Sub∣stance whereof was, The Dissatisfaction of the King at the Proceedings of the 2 last Westminster Parliaments, in giving him no suitable Return, to support the Alliances he had made for the general Peace of Christendom; nor for the further Examination into the Plot; nor yet for the Preservation of Tangier; He shewed a mighty Concern at their Votes against any Body's lending him Money upon the Revenues; and that the Prosecution of Dissenters, was a Grievance to the Subject, by which he said, They assumed to themselves a Power of sus∣pending Laws. But, as Mr. Coke observes well, the Commons in that did nothing but what they might do, as well as in any other Law they found by Experience to be grievous to the Sub∣ject, and must have done so, in order to the Repealing of them. And if the Matter had been really so, as the Declaration in∣tended, the Crime had surely been somewhat the less in the Commons; if his Majesty had considered, that himself had twice before done the same Thing by his Declarations of Indul∣gence, tho' to a contrary End to what the Commons intended. That these Things had caused him to dissolve them, and as∣semble another at Oxford; who still pursuing the same Methods in the Business of the Exclusion of the Duke of York; which he could by no Means give way to, tho' he was willing to ad∣mit of any other Expedient, whereby the Established Religion might be preserved, (tho' he never propounded any;) And the 2 Houses imbroiling themselves in the Business of Fitz-Harris, so as they were put out of Capacity of transacting
other Affairs, had caused him to put an End to that Parliament also. But that, however, notwithstanding the Malice of ill Men to perswade the People, that he intended to lay aside the Use of Parliaments, he declared, That no Irregularity in Par∣liament should make him out of love with them, and that he was resolved to have frequent Parliaments, and in the Inter∣vals would use his utmost Endeavours to extirpate Popery, and redress the Grievances of his Subjects. But how well he kept his Word in respect to frequent Parliaments, or redressing his Peoples Grievances in near 4 Years time he lived after, is so notoriously known to the contrary, that there needs no Proof of it. I'll say nothing in this place of the Invalidity of his De∣claration in it self, since the Matter has been contested: But the Gentleman whose Name was to it, and who thought him∣self so much injured, when it was taken notice of, that it bore no other Authority but his, would have done well to have made appear to the World, that the Broad-Seal was affix'd to it, which hitherto he has not done. But be this as it will, tho' the King did not communicate this Declaration to the Council till Friday the 8th of Apr. yet the foresaid Author, Sir W. J. says, M. Barillon, the French Embassador, read it upon the 5th of April before, and demanded of a Gentleman there his Opi∣nion of it; which M. Barillon might the better remember, be∣cause of the great Liberty the Gentleman took to ridicule it to his Face. But to return to Fitz-Harris, whom we left in the Tower; the poor Man was kept there for 10 Weeks together so close a Prisoner, that neither his Wife, nor any other, were per∣mitted to come at him, (whereas the Popish Lords, impeach∣ed in Parliament, had the Liberty of the Tower, and for a∣ny Man to visit them) and then there was an Indictment of High Treason formed against him, for contriving a certain Writing, called, The true English Man; and so on the last Day of April he was Arraigned at the King's Bench-Bar: But his Wife, in the mean time, having some Foresight of her Husband's Tri∣al, had gone to Council, and had a Plea drawn to the Jurisdi∣ction of the Court: To which the Attorney General demurred, and Fitz-Harris's. Council joined in the Demurrer; then time was given them to the Saturday following to maintain the said Plea by Argument, which was done accordingly; and that be∣ing ended, the Lord Chief Justice declared, The Court would take time to consider before they gave in their Judgment; which they did on the Wednesday following, being the 11th of May, when three of the Judges, to wit, the Chief Justice, and the Judges, Jones and Raymond, were of Opinion, That the Plea was sufficient. But Justice Dolbin was doubtful. And so the Plea was over-ruled, and the Prisoner was ordered to plead; which he did, and the Trial put off till June 9, when he was
found Guilty of High-Treason, without any Benefit had at all of the Impeachment of the House of Commons. But its pitty some of these Judges had not been hanged for their Pains, as Tresilian was in the Reign of Richard the Second. However, to colour the matter yet a little, and that the Court might still make a feint, which was their last, of prosecuting the Popish Plot in the right Course of it; Oliver Plunket was, June 1, in Trinity Term tried for High-Treason at the Kings Bench Bar, for that he was made Primate of Ireland by the Pope, at the French King's Recommendation; that upon that account he ha∣ving engaged to do that King all the Service that lay in his Power, he had actually levied among his Popish Clergy, great Sums of Money, therewith to introduce the French Dominion into that Kingdom, and exterminate the Protestants, for which he was found guilty, on the 1st of July following, and was, to∣gether with Edward Fitz-Harris, executed at Tyburn. And now the sacrificing of this one Man, and a Primate of Ireland, hath attoned for all the rest of the Sins of the Papists, and they are wholly left at liberty to sing a Requiem for themselves, and to prosecute their Revenge against those who had in any thing appear'd zealous for the true Interest of their Country, and against their evil Machinations.Stephen Col∣ledge Try'd. The first that felt the Weight of their Indignation, was one Stephen Colledge, commonly known by the Name of The Protestant Joyner, a mean Man, but a great Talker against the Popish Plot; against whom an In∣dictment of High-Treason was exhibited to the Grand Jury, whereof Mr. Wilmore was Fore-man; But this Indictment would not go down; For the Grand Jury returned an Ignoramus upon it, for which Wilmore was apprehended, and examined before the Council Aug. 16, and sent to the Tower, and was after∣ward forced to fly his Country. But tho' the Design thus mis∣carried in London, yet the Party would not be discouraged, and so they laid a new Scene against Colledge at Oxford, where they hoped to find a more plyable Grand Jury: And to make sure that the Bill might not miscarry, the King's Council had pre∣pared Witnesses at the Aizes to post thither, and were them∣selves privately shut up with the Jury till they had found the Bill, which was a most unjustifiable and intolerable Practice. But because they would seem to allow the poor Man all the Li∣berty and Advantage imaginable for his own Defence, tho' they kept him as close in the Tower as they did Fitz-Harris; yet they allow'd him one West for his Sollicitor; but it was on∣ly with an intent to betray him. For as soon as the Bill was found against him, one Murtel a Goaler, and Sawel a Messen∣ger were dispatch'd to bring him to his Trial; Who, after they had taken him out of Prison, ran him into an House, and by order of the King's Council, took from him all his Instructions for his Defence, which were carried to them, as well to disable
him to make his Defence, as to inable them how to proceed a∣gainst him by some way he was not provided for to plead for himself. I will not enter into a further detail of this way of Procedure, but certainly it was the most barbarous and illegal, I think, that ever was heard of; and the whole was nothing else but a Combination of the Judges, (whereof Sir Francis North was Chief, and the Mouth of the Court) King's Coun∣cil, Jury and Evidence, as may be seen at large in Sir John Hawles's Learned Observations upon his Trial; Yet after all, the Man under these severe Circumstances, was not wanting to himself, but stoutly made his Defence, and perhaps (as the said Learned Person observes) the best Defence, all Circum∣stances consider'd, that ever Man made for his Life. But had he defended himself with the Tongue of Men and Angels, it had availed him nothing; For it was a matter resolved upon, and he must die; and so he was Aug. 18. found guilty of High-Treason, and on the 31st of the same Month, executed accord∣ingly. The same Designs, as against Colledge, were formed against my Lord of Shaftsbury, and took so far, that being taken up at his House in Aldersgate-street, July the 2d. and brought before the Council at Whitehall, (whither the King came that day on purpose from Windsor) he was committed to the Tower; But notwithstanding an Inventory of Rogues they got to swear a∣gainst him, and all their Practices upon Captain Wilkinson, who proved too honest to be tempted, even by blessed Memory him∣self, who failed not to attack him to that end at the Secretaries Office; The Grand Jury, Nov. 24, whereof that worthy Gen∣tlemen, Sir Samuel Bernardiston, was Foreman; and for all the whole Bench of Judges sat in Court to influence the matter, re∣turned Ignoramus upon the Bill; whereat all the People disco∣vered their Satisfaction and good Will to the Nation, not on∣ly by a general Shout, but with such Indignation against the Rascally Hireling-Witnesses, that they would have torn them to pieces, had it not been for the prudent care of the Sheriffs to prevent it; as also by making several Bone-fires that Night in the City. His Royal Highness was all this while in Scotland, moulding that Nation under a Protestant Mask, for a Popish Successor and Government, the Parliament there chimed in with him, and made a Test and other Acts, which, in the main, were less binding than what were in force before; and whereat many of the Members seemed so dissatisfied, that they desired other Ad∣ditions and Acts, which the Duke in open Parliament promised, when Time and Opportunity offered; but when at any time that was proposed, the Test was obtruded. Among the rest, there had been an Act made that was less binding to the Suc∣cessor to the Crown, as to his own Profession; The Earl of Ar∣gyle
proposed at the passing thereof, That all other Acts a∣gainst Popery might be added; which was so contrary to the Duke's Designs,The Earl of Argyle's Case. and so inraged him against the Earl, that all Methods imaginable were proposed to ruine him, which at last was effected under a pretence of his putting his own Sense and Interpretation upon the Test, when he took it; (tho' others had done it as well as he) and so the Earl was prosecuted here∣upon with so much Cruelty, Unjustice and Oppression, and by such execrable and partial Methods, that none could be guilty of, but him that was at the Head of the Business, and his sworn Slaves; and he was upon the said trivial Account, found guilty of High-Treason, as you may read at large in the Earl's Case; and indeed its worth any honest Mans reading; but I would not curtail it here, and to insert it at large, would not be consistent with the present Design. However, that brave Man made a shift to escape his Destiny at that time, by exchanging Cloaths with his Daughter, and so getting privately out of Edenburg-Castle, and flying beyond the Seas; tho' he could not do it af∣terwards, but fell a Sacrifice to the same Revenge that thus made him first miserable. But while our Royal Pair were act∣ing the T—against their innocent Subjects, Laws and Con∣stitution, the French were playing another part abroad, which, in my Mind, let others think what they list, was not near so bad, tho' I do not at all justifie it. You have heard before, how that after the Conclusion of the Peace of Nimeguen, the French still continued their Pre∣tensions to some Places both in Flanders, and on the Rhine; Concerning which last, we have already given you the Memo∣rial of the Emperor to the Dyet of Ratlsbone, and their Result thereupon. Now there was no City on that side so much a∣larm'd from time to time, as Strasburg; and of this there were frequent Accounts given, even in the publick News of those days; But the French, the more to amuse them this Year, dis∣posed of their Troops in that order, that it was but Sept. 13 that they wrote from that City, that they were very easie in those Parts, the French Troops being gone into their Winter Quarters; and that it was likely to be so with them, since the French King's Designs were towards Italy; tho' at the same time they could not but take notice of the great Magazines that were provided both in Lorrain and Alsace. But they, or the Rogues amongst them, who betray'd them, might flatter them∣selves as long as they pleased, with the thoughts of their Se∣curity; Whereas the French King was this very Month set out toward their Frontiers, having sent M, Louvois before to draw the Troops suddenly together for the Enterprize. One should think it a strange thing, that a Person whose great Ta∣lent was to be a Minister of a State, and no Souldier, among so many profess'd Souldiers and great Commanders, where∣with
France abounded, should be singled out to perform this Military Enterprize; But upon second Thoughts, it will it be allowed to have been a piece of Justice, to grant him, who had made the Bargain, the honour of taking Possession; for Mr. Louvois was fouly belyed, if he had uot been divers times at Strasburg, inoognito, to that end, as well as in greater Places. And we have known Richlieu occasionally lead the French Army over the Alps into Italy, as Mazarine has often acted that part on other Occasions. But to return, Mr. Louvois having used great Diligence and Secresie, appear'd with a great number of Troops before Strasburg, and the very same Day order'd a Regiment of Dragoons to seize upon the Fort of Kiel, that guards the Bridge of the City, and sent the Magistrates Word; That the King expected they should render him the Oath of Fidelity and Obedience, due to him by the Treaty of Munster, which had yielded to him all the Vpper and Lower Alsatia, and consequently that City, which was the Capital thereof, (a pretty Pretence indeed!) and should receive a Garrison of his Troops into it. Here∣upon the Magistrates, by Concert, no doubt, made no Hesi∣tation to submit; but, for Form sake, proposed Conditions, of which take the following Sceach, and the rather, because hereby it will be easie, almost for any Reader to discern, whe∣ther there have been afterwards any Infractions made in the present Agreement. ARTICLES, as Proposed by the Proetors, Consuls, and Magistrates of the City of Strasburg,; and as they were granted by the Marquess de Louvois, and the Baron de Monclair, the King's Lieute∣nant General in Alsace, Sept. 30. 1681. I. THat the City of Strasburg,Articles granted Strasburg. and all its Dependancies shall be received into His Majesty's Protection. II. That his Majesty will confirm the ancient Priviledges, Rights, Statutes, and Customs of the City of Strasburg, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, pursuant to the Treaty of West∣phalia, confirmed by that of Nimeguen, Both which were granted. III. That His Majesty should leave them the free Exercise of their Religion, as it had been since 1624. to this time, with all the Churches and Schools, and that his Majesty would not permit any Person whatsoever to make any Pre∣tensions upon them, but for ever preserve them to the City and its Inhabitants.
Granted that the City shall enjoy all its Ecclesiastical Goods and Revenues, pursuant to the Treaty of Mun∣ster, except the Cathedral of our Lady, which should be restored to the Catholicks. However, His Majesty would permit the Inhabitants to make use of the Bells of the said Church, but not to Ring them to Prayers. A great Favour indeed! IV. That His Majesty should leave the Magistracy in the State it was in then, with all its Rights, and Freedom of Ele∣ction, and its Jurisdiction Civil and Criminal. This was granted also, except in such Causes as should exceed 1000 French Livres Capital, in which an Ap∣peal might be made to the Council at Brisac; yet so, as that the said Appeal should not suspend the Exa∣mination of the Judgment given by the Magistrates, unless the Question were above 2000 Livres. V. That his Majesty should grant to the City all its Reve∣nues, Rights, Tolls, Commerce, Money, Magazines of Can∣non, Ammunition, Arms; Magazines of Corn and Wood, and its Records and Publick Papers. Granted, except what concerned the Cannon, Arms, Am∣munition, and Publick Magazines, which should be de∣livered to the King's Officers, And for the Arms of Particular Persons, they should be brought into the Town-House, and be put in a Room, of which the Magistrates should have the Keys. VI. That the Burghers should be exempted from all Contri∣butions, and other Engagements, the King leaving to the Ci∣ty all the Ordinary and Extraordinary Imposts. VII. That his Majesty should leave to the City the free enjoyment of the Bridge over the Rhine, with all its Bourgs, Villages, and Country-Houses. VIII. That his Majesty should grant an Amnesty for what was past, without any Exception, and to comprehend therein the Prince Palatine of Valdentz. IX. That His Majesty should permit them to build Places to Lodge the Troops that are in Garrison. And Lastly, That the King's Troops should enter the Town at Four in the Afternoon, All which was agreed to. This sudden and unexpected Business could not but alarm the whole Empire in general, as it did the Court of Vienna in particular: But as the former were very slow and irresolute in their Deliberations about keeping up a sufficient Standing Force to oppose the Encroachments of France, so there was such a terrible Cloud gathering together against the latter, as took up in a manner their entire Thoughts how to shelter themselves from it, and to obviate the impending Danger.
But of this we shall have further occasion to speak to in its proper place. In the mean time we will see what was doing in England this Year, which comes to be 1682. and the main Work whereof was, the barbarous Prosecution of Protestant Dissenters,Protestant Dissenters Prosecuted. and how to curb the rest of the Nation, so as to truckle entirely under che Court-girdle: Herein they made very great Progress, in the base Addresses that were procu∣red to be sent from all Quarters: But the Ignoramus-Bill of my Lord Shaftsbury stuck deep in their Stomachs, and the Fears of being baulked in any such Design for the future, made them set their Wits on the Tenter-Hooks, how they might take away the Election of Sheriffs out of the Power of the City; and no other Expedient could be found, but by ta∣king away their Charter; which, if once effected, would not only give the Court the advantage of making Sheriffs, but o∣pen a Gap to their making a House of Commons too, for near 5 Parts in 6 of the House of Commons were Burgesses and Barons of the Cinque-Ports, who would not dare to con∣test their Charter if the City of London could not hold hers: So that in Hillary Term this Year a Quo Warranto was brought against the City for two helnous Crimes, viz. That they had made an Address to the King for the Parliament to Sit for Redress of Grievances, and to settle the Nation; (yet King Charles I. thought the Parliament's Vote of Non-Addresses to him was Deposing of him) and that the City had raised Mo∣ney towards repairing Cheapside Conduit,The Char∣ter of Lon∣don questi∣oned. ruined by the Fire of London. We will give you the matter here as entirely and cursorily as we can; and thus it was: The City pleaded their Right; and the King replied; upon which there was a De∣murrer; and here the matter rested for a time, the Novelty whereof causing a great Amusement in the Generality of the City and Nation whereto it tended, and how it would end. In the mean while the Duke of York, after having narrowly esca∣ped drowning in his last Voyage to Scotland, and then done his Work in that Kingdom, was returned to London; and his Zeal for promoting the Catholick Cause outgoing his Patience for the Court's Judgment upon the Demurrer to the Quo Warranto, there appeared Courtiers of the first Magnitude bare-fac'd for the next Election of Sheriffs, and Sir Dudley North, and Sir Peter Rich were returned, the one by a shame∣less Trick, and the other by open Force. And herewith we will end this short Year, but pernicious enough to England; and to encrease the Misfortune of it, was so fatal to Rupert Prince Palatine of the Rhine, who died of a Fever and Pleurisie at his House in Spring-Garden, in the 63d Year of his Age, and who (to pass the Errors of his Fiery Youth, wherein he was engaged with too much Fury and Ravage in the Party of his Uncle King Charles; in our unhappy Civil Wars) had of
late Years proved a faithful Councellor to the King, and a great Patriot to the English Liberty; and therefore was towards his latter end, neglected by the Court to that degree, that no∣thing passed between him and his great Kindred but Civilities in the Common Forms. But though the Court had gained this Point, yet they thought it not fit at present to push it farther, till the Demurrer to the City-Charter was determined, in which such haste was made, that only two Arguments were per∣mitted on either side; one in Hillary-Term, 1683. and the o∣ther in Easter-Term following; and so Judgment was given in Trinity-Term next after against the City. But such a Judgment was never given in any Case as this; and if the manner of Electing the last Sheriffs was strange and unwarrantable, this was no less so; for it was without any Reason given, and by two Judges only; whereof the one was Sir Francis Withens (who had heard but one Argument, and perhaps understood but little of that; and who afterwards, in the Absence of Sir Edward Herbert, delivered that for his Opinion, which Sir Edward, when present, disowned;) and the other was Sir Thomas Jones. However, if you will believe them, they said, Justice Raymond was of the same Opinion with them; and so was Sanders, the Chief Justice, though he was past his Senses, and had only Understanding enough left to Expostulate with them for then Troubling him when he had lost his Memory. But the Cout of King's-Bench was not so ripe for this hasty Judgment,The pre∣tended Pres∣byterian ior. as they at Whitehall were for Discovery of Plots a∣gainst the Government, and justice of the Nation; of which, they set no less than 3 on Foot; one was to surprize the Guards; Another, the Rye-House-Plot, to Murther the King and his dear Brother, as they were to pass by from New-Market; and the Black-Heath Plot, wherein the People were to rise upon a Foot-Ball-Match: They were sure of the Sheriffs, and it was Burton and Graham's Business to find out good Jury-Men, and then the Sheriffs would be sure to return them: In these Plots my Lord H— seemed to have the greatest hand: But, more par∣ticularly, Rumsey was the Evidence in respect to that of the Seizing the Guards; Lee and Goodenough in that of Black-Heath, Rumball (at whose House they said the Rye-Plot was to be acted) denied at his Death he ever knew any. But the great design was against the Earl of Essex, the Lord Russel, and such great Patriots, who had shewed themselves zealous Protestants upon all Occasions, and constant Opposers of the designs of Pope∣ry, and Arbitrary Power. As for the first of these two Noble Persons, he never absconded, but was presently confined Priso∣ner in the Tower; where in a few Days after, it was given out he had cut his own Throat;Earl of Es∣sex's Death. and to satisfie the Nation of the Truth of the Report, and Sincerity of the Government therein,
the Business was so ordered, that before the Jury, was Impan∣nelled, and the Coroner's Inquest sate, the Earl's Body was taken out of the Closet, (where it was pretended he had laid violent Hands upon himself,) and stripp'd off his Cloathes, which were carried away, add the Closet washed: And when one of the Jury insisted to see my Lord's Cloaths in which he died, the Coroner was sent for into another Room; and upon his Return he told the Jury, it was the Body, and not the Clothes, they were to lit upon: And a Motion being made, that the Jury should adjourn, and give my Lord's Relations notice, that if they had any thing to say in my Lord's Behalf, they should do it within such a time; it was answered, That the King had sent for the Inquisition, and would not rise from the Counil-Board till it was brought: But whether it proved to His Majesty's Satisfaction, I will not take upon me to de∣termine, though it was reported he seem'd much concern'd, at the Misfortune: saying, My Lord of Essex needed not to have despaired of Mercy, since he owed him a Life. Be it as it will, his being that Day in Person, accompanied with his good Brother in the Tower, where neither of them had been for near 15 Years before, set People's Tongues loose to Censure; and so much the more, when it was known that particular care was taken to give immediate Notice to the Court at the Old-Baily of the Earl's Disaster; that, in the worst Sence, Use might be made of it by the King's Council against my Lord Russel, then upon his Trial; as the Council did accordingly, and which had the design'd Effect upon that Noble Person, who some days after suffered innocently in Lincolns-Inn-Fields, after he had made a Speech, and left a Paper in the Sheriff's Hands, to declare the same to the World; both which, lest forgot by any true English-man, and particularly the last, I have thought fit to subjoin, because it carries in it, in my O∣pinion, a perfect Confutation of that Sham-Conspiracy, and gives a true Idea of whatever Meeting he had been at with other Men of Quality, to discourse of the Affairs or their Countrey; and how, if possible, in a just Way, to prevent it, Ruin, both in Religion and Liberty. JULY 12th. 1683. Mr. Sheriff, I Expected the Noise would be such,Lord  Speech. that I could not be very well heard: I was never fond of very much speaking, much less now, therefore I set down in this Paper all that I think sit to leave behind me. God knows how far I was always from De∣signs against the King's Person, or of altering the Government; and I still Pray for the Preservation of both, and of the Prote∣stant Religion.
I am told, that Captain Walcot has said something concerning my Knowledge of the Plot; I know not whether the Report be true or not, but I hope it is not; for, to my Knowledge, I ne∣ver saw him, to speak with him, in my whole Life: And, in the Words of a Dying Man, I profess, I know of no Plot, either against the King's Life, or the Government. But I have now done with this World, and am going to a better. I forgive all the World, and I thank God, I die in Charity with all Men. And I wish all sincere Protestants may love one another, and not make room for Popery by their Animosities. The PAPER delivered to the Sheriffs. I Thank God, I find my self so composed, and prepared for Death, and my Thoughts so fixed on another World, that I hope in God I am quite from setting my Heart on this; Yet I cannot forbear now the setting down in Writing, a far∣ther Account of my Condition, to be left behind me, than I will venture to say at the Place of Execution, in the Noise and Clutter that is like to be there. I bless God heartily for those many Blessings which he, in his Infinite Mercy, has be∣stowed upon me through the whole Course of my Life; That I was born of worthy good Parents, and had the Advan∣tages of a Religious Education, which are invaluable Blessings; For, even when I minded it least, it still hung about me, and gave me Checks, and has now, for many Years, so influ∣enced and possessed me, that I feel the happy Effects of it in this my Extremity, in which I have been so wonderfully (I thank God) supported, that neither my Imprisonment, nor fear of Death, have been able to discompose me in any Degree; but on the contrary, I have found the Assurances of the Love and Mercy of God, in, and through my Blessed Re∣deemer, in whom only I trust: And I do not question but that I am going to partake of that Fullness of Joy which is in his Presence: The Hopes therefore do so wonderfully delight me, that I think this is the happiest Time of my Life, though others may look upon it as the saddest. I have lived, and now am of the Reform'd Religion, a true and sincere Protestant, and in the Communion of the Church of England, though I could never yet comply with, or rise up to all the Heighths of many People. I wish with all my Soul all our differences were removed; and that all sincere Protestants would so far consider the danger of Popery, as to lay aside their Heats, and agree against the Common Enemy; and that the Church-men would be less severe, and the Dissenters less scrupulous; for I think bitterness, and Persecution are at all times bad, but much more now.
For Popery, I look on it as an Idolatrous and bloody Re∣ligion; and therefore thought my self bound, in my Station, to do all I could against it: And by that I foresaw I should procure such great Enemies to my self, and so powerful ones, that I have been now for some time expecting the worst; and blessed be God, I fall by the Ax, and not by the Fiery Tryal: Yet, whatever Apprehensions I had of Popery, and of my own severe and heavy share I was like to have un∣der it when it should prevail, I never had a Thought of do∣ing any thing against it basely, or inhumanely, but what would well consist with the Christian Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom: And, I thank God, I have examined all my Actions in that matter with so great Care, that I can appeal to God Almighty, who knows my Heart, that I went on sincerely, without being moved ei∣ther by Passion, By-Ends, or ill Design. I have always lo∣ved my Countrey much more than my Life; and never had any Design of changing the Government, which I value, and look upon as one of the best Governments in the World, and would always have been ready to venture my Life for the preserving it, and would suffer any Extremity, rather than have consented to any Design of taking away the King's Life: Neither had any Man the Impudence to propose so base and barbarous a thing to me: And I look upon it as a very unhappy and uneasie part of my present Condition, that there should be so much as Mention made of so vile a Fact, though nothing in the least was said to prove any such Mat∣ter; but the contrary, by my Lord Howard; Neither does a∣ny Body, I am confident, believe the least of it: So that I need not, I think, say more. For the King, I do sincerely pray for him, and wish well to him, and to the Nation, that they may be happy in one a∣nother, that he may be indeed the Defender of the Faith; that the Protestant Religion, and the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom may be preserv'd, and flourish under his Govern∣ment; and that himself, in his Person may be happy both here and hereafter. As for the Share I had in the Prosecution of the Popish Plot, I take God to Witness, that I proceeded in it in the Sincerity of my Heart, being then really convinced (as I am still) that there was a Conspiracy against the King, the Nation, and the Protestant Religion: And I likewise profess, that I ne∣ver knew any thing directly or indirectly of any Practice with the Witnesses, which I look upon as so horrid a thing, that I never could have endured it: For, I thank God, Falshood and Cruelty were never in my Nature, but always the farthest from it imaginable. I did believe, and do still, that Popery is breaking in upon the Nation; and that those that advance it, will stop at nothing to carry on their De∣sign.
I am heartily sorry that so many Protestants give their helping hand to it: But I hope God will preserve the Pro∣testant Religion, and this Nation, though I am afraid it will fall under very great Trials, and very sharp Sufferings: And indeed, the Impiety and Profaneness that abounds, and ap∣pears so scandalously bare-faced every where, gives too just an Occasion to fear the worst thing that can befal a People. I pray God prevent it, and give those who have shewed a Concern for the publick Good, and have appeared hearty for the true Interest of the Nation, and the Protestant Re∣ligion, Grace to live so, that they may not cast a Reproach on that which they, endeavour to advance; which (God knows) has often given me sad Thoughts; And I, hope such of my Friends as may think they are touched by this, will not take what I say in ill Part, but will endeavour to amend their ways, and live suitable to the Rules of the true Reformed Religion; which is the only thing can administer true Com∣fort at the latter end, and relieve a Man when he comes to die. As for my present Condition, I bless God, I have no re∣pining in my Heart at it; I know for my Sins I have de∣served much worse at the Hands of God, so that I chearfully submit, to so small a Punishment, as the being taken off a few Years sooner, and the being made a Spectacle to the Worl. I do freely, forgive all the World, particularly those concerned in taking away my Life; and I desire and conjure all my Friends to think of no Revenge, but to sub∣mit to the Holy Will of God, into whose Hands I resign my self entirely. But to look back a little, I cannot but give some touch about the Bill of Exclusion, and shew the Reasons of my ap∣pearing in that Business, which in short, is this; That I thought the Nation in such Danger of Popery, and that the Expectation of a Popish Successor (as I have said in Parlia∣ment) put the King's Life likewise in much Danger, that I saw no way so effectual to secure both, as such a Bill. As to the Li∣mitations that were proposed, if they were sincerely offered, and had passed into a Law, the Duke then should have been ex∣cluded from the Power of a King, and the Government quite altered, and a little more than the Name of a King left. So I could not see either Sin or Fault in the one, when all People were willing to admit of the other; But thought it better to have a King with his Prerogative, and the Nation easie and safe under him, than a King without it; which bred perpetual Jealousies, and a continual Struggle. All this I say, only to Justifie my Sir, and not to enlame others; Though I cannot but think my earnestness in that matter, has had no small Influence in my present Sufferings. But I have now
done with this World, and am going to a Kingdom▪ which cannot be moved. And as to the conspiring to seize the Guards, which is the Crime for which I am Condemned, and which is made a Constructive Treason for taking away the King's Life, to bring it within the Statute of Edw. 3. I shall give this true and clear Account. I never was at Mr. Shepheard's with that Company, but once, and there was no undertaking then of securing, or seizing the Guards, nor none appointed to view, or examine them. Some Discourse there was of the feasibleness of in, and several times by Accident in general Dis∣course elsewhere, I have heard it mentioned as a thing might easily be done, but never consented to, as a thing fit to be done: And I remember particularly at my Lord Shaftsbury's, there being some general Discourse of this kind; I immedi∣ately flow out, and exclaimed against it, and asked, if the thing succeeded, what must be done next but mastering the Guards, and killing them in cold Blood; which I looked up∣on as a detestable thing, and so like a Popish Practice, that I could not but abhor it. And at the same time the Duke of Monmouth took me by the Hand, and told me very kindly, My Lord, I see you and I are of a Temper, did you ever hear so hor∣rid a thing? And I must needs do him Justice to declare, that I ever observed in▪ him an Abhorrence of all base things. As to my going to Mr. Shepheard's, I went with an Intenti∣on to taste Sherry; For he had promised to reserve for me the next very good Piece he met with, when I went out of Town: And if he recollects himself, he may remember I asked him about it, and he went and fetch'd a Bottle; but when I tasted it I saw it was hot in the Mouth, and desired that whenever he met with a choice Piece, he would keep it for me; which he promised. I enlarge the more upon this, because Sir George Jefferys insinuated to the Jury, as if I had made a Story about going thither; but I never said that was the only Rea∣son; and I will now truly and plainly add you the rest. I was, the day before this Meeting, come to Town for two or three days, as I had done once or twice before, having a very near and dear Relation lying in a Languishing and Des∣perate Condition; and the Duke of Monmouth came to me, and told me, He was extreamly glad I was come to Town; for my Lord Shaftsbury, and some hot Men would undo us all. How so, my Lord, I said, Why (answered he) they will certain∣ly do some disorderly thing or other, if great Care be not taken; and therefore for God's Sake, use your Endeavour with your Friends to prevent any thing of this kind. He told me, there would be Company at Mr. Shepheard's that Night, and desired me to be at home in the Evening, and he would call me, which he did. And when I came into the Room, I
saw Mr. Rumsey by the Chimney, though he swears he came in after; And there were Things said by some, with much more Heat than Judgment, which I did sufficiently disapprove; and yet for these Things I stand Condemned: But, I thank God, my Part was sincere and well meant. It is, I know, In∣ferred from hence, and pressed to me, That I was acquainted with these Heats and ill Designs, and did not discover them; But this is but Misprision of Treason at most, so I die innocent of the Crime I stand Condemned for; I hope no Body will imagine that so mean a Thought should enter into me, as to go about to save my self by accusing others. The Part that some have acted lately of that kind, has not been such as to invite me to love Life at such a Rate. As for the Sentence of Death passed upon me, I cannot but think it a very hard one; for nothing was sworn against me (whether true or false, I will not now examine) but some Dis∣courses about making some Stirs: And this is not levying War against the King, which is Treason by the Statute of Edw. 3. and not the Consulting and Discoursing about it, which was all that was witnessed against me; but by a strange Fetch, the Design of seizing the Guards, was construed a Design of kil∣ling the King, and so I was in that Cast. And now I have truly and sincerely told what my Part was in that which cannot be more than a bare Misprision, and yet I am condemned as guilty of a Design of killing the King. I pray God lay not this to the Charge, neither of the King's Councel, nor Judges, nor Sheriffs, nor Jury; And for the Witnesses, I pity them, and wish them well, I shall not reck∣on up the Particulars, wherein they did me wrong; I had ra∣ther their own Consciences would do that, to which, and the Mercies of God, I leave them; Only I shall aver, that what I said of my not hearing Colonel Rumsey deliver any Message from my Lord Shaftsbury, was true; For I always detested Lying, tho' never so much to my Advantage; And I hope none will be so unjust and uncharitable, as to think I would venture on it in these my last Words, for which I am so soon to give an Account to the great God, the Searcher of Hearts, and Judge of all Things. From the Time of choosing Sheriffs, I concluded the Heat in that Matter would produce something of this Kind; and I am not much surprized to find it fall upon me; and I wish what is done to me, may put a Stop, and satiate some People's Re∣venge, and that no more innocent Blood be shed; for I must, and do still look upon mine as such, since I know I was guilty of no Treason; and therefore, I would not betray my Inno∣cency by flight, of which I do not (I thank God) yet repent, (tho' much pressed to it) how fatal soever it may have seemed to have proved to me; for I look upon my Death in this man∣ner
(I thank God) with other Eyes than the World does. I know I said but little at the Trial, and I suppose it looks more like Innocence than Guilt. I was also advised not to confess Matter of Fact plainly, since that certainly must have brought me within the Guilt of Misprision; and being thus restrained from dealing frankly and openly, I chose rather to say little, than to depart from that Ingenuity, that, by the Grace of God, I had carried along with me in the former part of my Life, and so could easier be silent, and leave the whole Matter to the Consciences of the Jury, than to make the best and so∣lemnest part of my Life so different from the Course of it, as the using little Tricks and Evasions must have been; nor did I ever pretend to any great Readiness in Speaking. I wish those Gentlemen of the Law, who have it, would make more Conscience in the Use of it, and not run Men down, and by Strains and Fetches impose on easie and willing Juries, to the Ruine of innocent Men. For to kill by Forms and Subtilties of the Law, is the worst sort of Murder. But I wish the Rage of hot Men, and the Partiality of Juries, may be stopped with my Blood, which I would offer up with so much the more Joy, if I thought I should be the last that were to suffer in such a Way. Since my Sentence, I have had but few Thoughts, but Pre∣paratory ones for Death; yet the Importunity of my Friends, and particularly the best and dearest Wife in the World, pre∣vailed with me to sign Petitions, and make an Address for my Life, to which I was ever averse; for (I thank God) though in all Respects I have lived the happiest and contentest Man of the World (for now very near Fourteen Years) yet I am so willing to leave all, that it was not without Difficulty that I did any thing for the saving of my Life, that was begging; but I was willing to let my Friends see what Power they had over me, and I was not obstinate nor sullen, but would do any thing that an honest Man could do for their Satisfaction, which was the only Motive that swayed, or had any Weight with me. And now to sum up all; As I had not any Design against the King's Life, or the Life of any Man whatsoever, so I ne∣ver was in any Contrivance of altering the Government. What the Heats, Passions, and Vanities of other Men have occasioned, I ought not to be responsible for; nor could I help them, though I now suffer for them: But the Will of the Lord be done, into whose Hands I commend my Spirit; and trust that Thou, O most merciful Father, hast forgiven me all my Transgressions, the Sins of my Youth, and all the Er∣rors of my past Life; and that Thou wilt not lay my secret Sins and Ignorances to my Charge, but wilt graciously support me, during that small Time of Life now before me, and assist
me in my last Moments, and not leave me then to be disorder∣ed by Fear, or any other Temptations, but make the Light of thy Countenance to shine upon me. Thou art my Sun and my Shield, and as thou supportest me by thy Grace, so I hope thou wilt hereafter Crown, me with Glory, and receive me into the Fellowship of Angels and Saints, in that blessed Inhe∣ritance, purchased for me by my most merciful Redeemer, who is, I trust, at thy Right Hand, preparing a lace for me, and is ready to receive me, into whose Hands I commend my Spirit. But, though this gallant Man ended his natural Life, with a Death in it self ignominious, yet his Memory shall always be retained by every good English Man. After the Death of these Noble Persons, the Remainder of the Game was play'd almost without Rub: Bateman the Chyrurgeon, Captain Walcot and Rouse followed all for Treason, and all of different Complecti∣ons; and where Treason could have no Colour actually to take away the Life of those that were Opponents to Popish Tyranny and Arbitrary Government. Misdemeanours were set on foot, to take away their Means of Living, by Fines, from 10000 to 100000 l. for Words against his Royal Highness; tho' by Mag∣na Charta a Salvo Contenemento is reserved for Misdemeanors against the King: And you may be sure, from what has been said before, that Jury men could not be missed off, and Sheriffs to return them that would effectually do the Work. But, tho' I do readily confess, I have no great Stomach to rake any fur∣ther into the cursed Designs of our then Court, in setting up Conspiracies for the Ruine of the Protestant Religion, and our Civil Rights in these Kingdoms; yet, give me leave to say somewhat for the Reader's Satisfaction of the Honourable Co∣lonel Sidney,Col. Sidney Try'd. who, for his noble Extract and Quality, was infe∣rior to few, but for his excellent Vertues hardly to be match'd by any; which last was especially, a constant Eye-sore to our Court, and therefore he must be hooked Neck and Shoulders into the Conspiracy: But, though otherwise, he was a Person of admirable Parts, yet he said not much at his Tryal, as be∣lieving whatever he should say, would signifie nothing with that Judicature, whom he thought had already prejudged him; and so it was really, in effect; for, as the Learned Mr. Hawles judiciously observed, He was meerly talked to Death, under the Notion of a Commonwealths-man, and found Guilty by a Jury, who were not much more proper Judges in the Case, than they should have been, if what he had writ had been done by him in Syriac or Arabick. It's observable, the Indictment a∣gainst him was never presented to the Grand Jury, before they came into the Hall, and yet they found it immediately, and was, in substance, like the rest; For a Conspiracy to Depose the
King, and stirring up Rebellion; and, as an Addition, for writing a Libel to that Purpose. The greatest part of the Evidence (as it was in my Lords Russel's Case) was only Hear-say; nay, West, whose Evidence was once rejected, must be admitted now, and that to tell a long Story of what he had heard from one and ano∣ther Person; the rest, viz. Rumsey and my Lord Howard's, with his Council of 6, were much of the same Stamp; only my Lord was very Rhetorical; even to Pedantry, upon the Matter, ac∣cording to his vain, though usual Custom. But to clench the Matter, there was a Paper found in the Prisoner's Study, said to be his Writing; the Substance whereof was, An Enquiry into the several Forms of Government, and Reasons of their Decay; together with the Rights of the People, Bounds of Sovereignty, and Original Power; wherein, among other Things, were these Expressions: The King is subject to the Law of God, as he is a Man; to the People that made him such, as a King: And, wherein there are Examples cited, how evil Princes had been sometimes destroyed by a Popular Fury, as others had been deposed. But where was the Treason of all this? Or if it had been so, why did they not prove, that it was his Hand-writing? But in short, so far as any Man of im∣partial Principles, and good Sense, has heard of them Papers, they contained in them a great deal more Learning and recti∣fied Principles, than the Chief Justice Jeffreys had Manners, when, without any Regard to the Noble Family, and the Name of the Sidneys, he said the Prisoner was born a Trayor. It will be too long to run through all the Particulars; And therefore I shall, and can only gratifie the Reader with something that was his own, and that is his last Speech at his Execution upon Tower-Hill, Dec. 7. 1683, after I have first premised, that King Charles shewed his usual Gratitude to Mr. Sidney (now the Right Honourable the Earl of Rumney) the Colonel's Brother, in cutting him off for so trivial a Crime, if it was any, for ha∣ving not long before taken so much Pains to bring the Defensive League about with Holland, which his Majesty valued himself so much upon in Parliament, to say nothing of his Majesty's many other Obligations to that Noble Family. Men, Brethren and Fathers; Friends, Countrymen, and Strangers, IT may be expected that I should now say some great Mat∣ters unto you,Col. Sidney's Paper. but the Rigour of the Season, and the In∣irmities of my Age, encreased by a close Imprisonment of above 5 Months, doth not permit me.
Moreover, we live in an Age that maketh Truth pass for Treason: I dare not say any Thing contrary unto it, and the Ears of those that are about me, will probably be found too tender to hear it. My Tryal and Condemnation doth suffi∣ciently evidence this. West, Rumsey and Keyling, who were brought to prove the Plot, said no more of me, than that they knew me not; And some others equally known unto me, had used my Name, and that of some others, to give a little Reputation unto their Designs. The Lord Howard is too infamous by his Life, and the many Perjuries not to be denied, or rather sworn by himself, to deserve mention; and being a single Witness, would be of no Value, though he had been of an unblemish'd Credit, or had not seen and confessed, that the Crimes com∣mitted by him, would be pardoned only for committing more; and even the Pardon promised, could not be obtained till the Drudgery of Swearing was over. This being laid aside, the whole Matter is reduc'd to the Papers said to be found in my Closet by the King's Officers, without any other Proof of their being written by me, than what is taken from the Suppositions upon the Similitude of an Hand that is easily counterfeited, and which hath been lately de∣clared in the Lady Car's Case, to be no lawful Evidence in Criminal Causes. But, if I had been seen to write them, the Matter would not be much altered: They plainly appear to relate unto a large Treatise written long since, in Answer to Filmer's Book, which, by all intelligent Men, is thought to be grounded up∣on wicked Principles, equally pernicious unto Magistrates and People. If he might publish unto the World his Opinion, That all Men are born under a Necessity, derived from the Laws of God and Nature, to submit unto an Absolute Kingly Govern∣ment, which could be restrained by no Law or Oath; and that he that hath the Power, whether he came unto it by Creati∣on, Election, Inheritance, Usurpation, or any other Way had the Right, none must oppose his Will, but the Persons and Estates of his Subjects must be indispensibly subject unto it. I know not, why I might not have published my Opinion to the Contrary, without the Breach of any Law I have yet known. I might as freely as he, publickly have declared my Thoughts, and the Reasons upon which they were grounded, and I per∣swaded to believe, That God had left Nations unto the Li∣berty of setting up such Governments as best pleased them∣selves. That Magistrates were set up for the good of Nations, not Nations for the Honour or Glory of the Magistrates.
That the Right and Power of Magistrates in every Country, was that which the Laws of that Country made it to be. That those Laws were to be observed, and the Oaths taken by them, having the Force of a Contract between Magistrate and People, could not be violated without danger of dissolving the whole Fabrick. That Usurpation could give no Right, and the most dange∣rous of all Enemies to Kings were they, who raising their Pow∣er to an exorbitant Height, allowed unto Usurpers all the Rights belonging unto it. That such Usurpations being seldom compassed without the Slaughter of the Reigning Person or Family, the worst of all Villanies was thereby rewarded with the most glorious Pri∣viledges. That if such Doctrines were received, they would stir up Men to the Destruction of Princes with more Violence, than all the Passions that have hitherto raged in the Hearts of the most Unruly. That none could be safe, if such a Reward were proposed unto any that could destroy them. That few would be so gentle as to spare even the Best, if, by their Destruction, one, of a wild Usurper, could become God's Anointed; and by the most execrable Wickedness invest him∣self with that Divine Character. This is the Scope of the whole Treatise; the Writer gives such Reason as at present did occur unto him to prove it. This seems to agree with the Doctrines of the most Reveren∣ced Authors of all Times, Nations and Religions. The best and wisest Kings have ever acknowledged it. The present King of France hath declared, That Kings have that happy Want of Power, that they can do nothing contrary unto the Laws of their Country, and grounds his Quarrel with the King of Spain, Anno 1667, upon that Principle. King James in his Speech to the Parliament, Anno 1603, doth in the highest Degree as∣sert it: The Scriptures seems to declare it. If nevertheless the Writer was mistaken, he might have been refuted by Law, Reason and Scripture; and no Man for such Matters was ever otherwise punished, than by being made to see his Error; and it hath not (as I think) been known, that they had been refer∣red to the Judgment of a Jury, composed of Men utterly un∣able to comprehend them. But there was little of this in my Case; the Extravagance of my Prosecutors goes higher: The above-mentioned Trea∣tise was never finished, nor could be in many Years, and most probably would never have been. So much as is of it, was written long since, never reviewed nor shewed unto any Man; And not the Fiftieth Part of it was produced, and not the Tenth of that afforded to be read. That which was never
known unto those who are said to have conspired with me, was said to be intended to stir up the People, in Prosecution of the Designs of those Conspirators. When nothing of particular Application unto Time, Place, or Person, could be found in it, (as hath ever been done by those who endeavoured to raise Insurrections) all was supplied by Innuendo's. Whatsoever is said of the Expulsion of Tarquin, the Insur∣rection against Nero; the Slaughter of Caligula, or Domiti∣an; the Translation of the Crown of France from Mero∣vius his Race unto Pepin, and from his Descendants unto Hugh Capet, and the like, are applied by Innuendo unto the King. They have not considered, that if such Acts of State be not good, there is not a King in the World that has any Title to that Crown he wears, nor can have any, unless he could deduce his Pedigree from the eldest Son of Noah, and shew that the Succession had still continued in the Eldest. of the eldest Line, and been so deduced to him. Every one may see what Advantage this would be to all the Kings of the World; and whether that failing, it were not better for them to acknowledge they had received their Crown by the Consent of willing Nations; or to have no bet∣ter Title unto them than Usurpation and Violence, which by the same Ways may be taken from them. But I was long since told, that I must die, or the Plot must die. Lest the Means of destroying the best Protestants in England should fail, the Bench must be filled with such as had been Ble∣mishes to the Bar. None but such as these would have advised with the King's Counsel, of the Means of bringing a Man to Death; suffered a Jury to be packed by the King's Sollicitors, and the Under-Sheriff; Admit of Jury-men, who are not Free-holders; Re∣ceive such Evidence as is above-mentioned; Refuse a Copy of an Indictment, or to suffer the Stat. of 46 Ed. 3. to be read, that doth expresly Enact, it should in no Case be denied unto any Man upon any Occasion whatsoever; over-rule the most im∣portant Points of Law without hearing. And whereas the Statute of 25 Edw. 3. upon which they said I should be tryed, doth reserve unto the Parliament all Constructions to be made in Points of Treason; They could assume unto them∣selves not only a Power to make Constructions, but such Constructions as neither agree with Law, Reason, or common Sense. By these Means I am brought to this Place. The Lord for∣give these Practices, and avert the Evils that threaten the Na∣tion for them. The Lord sanctifie these my Sufferings unto
me; and tho' I fall as a Sacrifice unto Idols, suffer not Ido∣llatry to be established in this Land. Bless thy People and say them. Defend thine own Cause, and defend those that defend it. Stir up such as are faint: Direct those that are willing: Confirm those that waver: Give Wisdom and Inte∣grity unto all. Order all things so as may most redound to to thine own Glory, Grant that I may die glorifying thee for all thy Mercies; And that at the last thou hast permitted me to be singled out as a Witness of thy Truth; and even by the Confession of my Opposers, for that OLD CAVSE in which I was from my Youth engaged, and for which thou hast often and wonderfully declared thy self. Yet notwithstanding all these Points gained, there was something to be done before it could be be said, That the King was a Despotical rince,Methods u∣sed to get the Char∣ters of Ci∣ties surren∣der'd. and would make his Will his Law. For tho' the City of London was now absolutely dependant upon his Majesty, in respect of the Magistracy thereof, and that the naming of the other Sheriffs of all the Countles and Shires of the Kingdom belonged unto him, yet there were many other Cities in England, who still chose their own Sheriffs; but something must have been done with these, before the Constitution of the Parliament could be subverted; which seemed to be the only White in the Butt they had been aiming at all this while: For you are to note, that the House of Com∣mons consists of 513 Members, whereof but 92 only are Knights of the Shires, so that near 5 Parts in 6 are Burgesses, Citizens, and Barons of the Cinque-Ports; and the generality of the Cor∣porations which send these Members, are poor decay'd Places, and so not in a Condition as the City of London was, to con∣test their Charters, or if they should, there were but little hopes to keep them, now London had not been able to hold hers. Yet it was considered also, that it would cost the Court-Agents a great deal of time to bring Quo Warranto's against a∣bove 200 Corporations; wherefore all Hands were set on work to induce these poor Inhabitants to surrender up their Rights; and mighty Rewards proposed unto those who should shew themselves forward and instrumental therein. But be∣cause Moneys were scarce, there were Bargains made wih Multitudes of them, to have Grants of Fairs for the Surrender of their Charters; and those who refused, must have Quo War∣ranto's brought against them. However, before these things were fully put in Execution, it was thought necessary to aug∣ment the standing Forces in England, who were already too many in time of Peace; For some Umbrages were taken, that Disturbances might arise, before they could be brought to Perfection. For tho' the Duke had secur'd Scotland, and had 20000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, and a Years Pay, to be assisting
upon all Occasions, and that greater Liberty than ever was given to the Irish, yet all this was not thought enough; and therefore Tangier, part of Queen Catherine's hopeful Porti∣on, which cost the King, her Husband, above 100000 l. a Year the keeping, for 20 Years together, must now at last, the Mould was near finished, be utterly demolished, and the Garrison brought over, which had been a Nursery of Popish Officers and Soldiers, and quartered in the most considera∣ble parts of the Kingdom. And in this pittiful State, we shall leave England, and see what mighty Changes have been made in the Face of Things in other Parts of Europe, and more particularly in the Kingdom of Hungary, where brake out the cruellest War between the Emperor and the Turks, and that has been intermixt with such Variety of Acti∣ons and Fortune in the long Course of it, as I think no Age nor History can parallel, the exact Particulars whereof we shall en∣deavour to give, as they shall fall out in due Series of Time, and their proper Order. But before we enter immediately upon that mighty Affair, it will be necessary to premise somewhat in this place, how things stood on this side the Empire towards France, and in the Netherlands. We have said something before concerning the Re-unions pretended to be made by France after the Trea∣ty of Nimeguen: But yet to be a little more particular; It was not long after the Conclusion of the said Peace, that that Crown possessed her self of Homhurg and Bisstel, the only two Places remaining to the Duke of Lorain, of all his Dutchy. However, tho' the Duke, who had ut little Power of his own, was forced tamely to submit to it, yet it could not be thought that others would be so willing to do it: And therefore, First, Monsieur Ravaux, who had searched all the Monuments of the Parliaments of Metz, and the Cities thereabouts, endeavoured from thence to prove; That in time of old, all Alsatia, Lorain, the Counties of Chiney, Arlon, Vierton, St. Armand, all the Country of Luxemburg, except the City of that Name, divers Villages and Seigniories in Germany, Flanders, Brabant, Hege∣now, and the Country of Liege, did really and of just Right be∣long to the King of France, as Dependences upon the three Bi∣shopricks of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, or upon other Places that had been yielded to them by the Treaty of Nimeguen. In pur∣sance hereof they erected in France 2 Tribunals of Justice, or Sovereign Courts, one at Metz, and the other at Brisac, by the Name of The Chambers of Re-unions, where the Inhabitants and Lords of all the fore-mentioned Places were gravely cited to appear before the Commissioners; Judges, and Parties, to see themselves condemned to make their Submission to the French King, and to receive his Orders thereupon; and in case of Refusal, to be condemned for Default and Contumacy. It
was under such Pretensions that Strasburg was seized on by that Crown; and by the same pretended Reasons Luxemburg had been blocked up in a manner ever since the Peace, and that as it were by way of Reprisal, because the Spaniards would not yield up to them several Places in Flanders, which they laid claim to. Which way of Procedure did at length, alarm all the Potentates upon the Continent, so that the Emperor, Swede∣land, the States of Holland, Franconia, and several other Free and Imperial Cities, entred into a mutual League of Defence, which was called,The League of Ausburg. The League of Ausburg; and to the Glory of the then Prince of Orange, it must be said, and is what his Ene∣mies have own'd, he was the greatest Instrument to bring it about of any in Europe. Good God! What shall we think of Eng∣land all this while? But I have told you already, our King had other Fish to fry; and 'tis very remarkable, that he was by this time fallen into such an abject State, in the Opinion of all the Neighbouring Princes and States, that it does not appear they ever sought as much as his Concurrence in, or Approbation of this League; though otherwise, (generally speaking) England was the only Kingdom that was wont to keep the Scales even between the contending Parties for many Ages together.The Carri∣age of the French up∣on the Turks invading Hungary. How∣ever whether it were out of the Apprehensions of the impending Storm upon Christendom from the Mahometan Quarters, or out of a meer Act of Generosity, this is certain, that as soon as the French King came to know that the Turk was bending all his Forces against the Empire, and to that End had ordered his Army to march towards Belgrade, not only with a Design to possess himself of all Hungary, but even to invade the Neigh∣bouring Provinces; he withdrew his Forces from before Luxem∣burg, though almost ready to surrender. But how consistent this Action was to the Correspondence held by Monsieur de Vernay, the French Minister in Poland, with Count Tekely, or with the Frontiers of Germany's being thwack'd now with Sol∣diers, I will not take upon me to determine; though I know they have by others been sufficiently censured. However, to return to what I have digressed from: You are to note, That the Emperor had been, for some Years past, plagued with a discontented Party in Hungary, of whom Count Tekely, at last, after the cutting off of Serini and others, became sole Head. There had been divers Expedients proposed to accommodate Matters between them, which proved in the End so ineffectual, that nothing would serve the Malecontents, but calling in the Turk, the common Enemy of Christianity; which the Emperor was not so little aware of,The Empe∣ror prepares against the Turks. but he made all the Preparations his then Circumstances would admit of to oppose him; not only by mustering up what Force he could of his own in the Here∣ditary, Countries, and inducing several Princes of the Em∣pire to concern themselves in the Quarrel, but by making a
strict Alliance with the King of Poland, and endeavouring to bring the Republick of Venice into the Confederacy: Though this last did not actually succeed till the following Year. On the 6th of May the Emperor gave the Command of his Army to Charles, Duke of Lorain, at a General Rendezvous near Presburg, in the Plains of Kitzen, from whence the Duke marched towards Raab, and from thence to Gran, where, after he had viewed the Place, he judged the Siege very unadvisable at that time, for Reasons where with the Emperor remained atisfied, who thereupon gave the Duke Orders to attempt something else that might give Reputation to the Army, which had been brought so early into the Field.Newheusel besieged by the Impe∣rialists. This made the Duke, with the Advice of the other Generals, resolve upon the Siege of Newheusel, against which the Attack was carried on with such Fury and Success, that the Imperialists quickly made themselves Masters of part of the Suburbs, and of a certain Building, that had been formerly made use of for a Church, into which Count Staremberg having ordered 50 Men and a Lieutenant, and Count Herberstein, by a fatal Mistake, bring∣ing up with him 150 more, they filled the Church so very full, that they had not room to turn themselves in it, much less make use of their Arms; so that being forced, for their Convenien∣cy, to break down the Benches, it occasioned such a Noise and Confusion, that some of the Imperialists that were coming up to relieve the Party, believing the Enemy to be there, fited several times upon them, and did some Execution before they perceived their Error. However, the Siege went on till the Duke of Lorain being informed, that the Grand Visier was coming to Buda with a very numerous Army,The Siege raised. he resolved to abandon it, and so to post his Troops, as to endeavour to co∣ver the Emperor's Territories, which were menaced with a dreadful Invasion; to which end he marched back towards Co∣morra; and, upon receiving further Intelligence of the Ap∣proach of the Turks, he hasted through the Isle of Schut to∣wards Raab, having the Danube on the Left Hand, and gave all necessary Assistance to fortifie the Place.The Turks advance to Austria. A few Days after a very great and confused Number of Turks, amounting of all sorts, to about 200000 Men, encamped in sight of the Impe∣rial Army, in the Way that leads from Stoel-Weissemburg to Raab, keeping themselves on the other side of the River of that Name, and from thence skirmished with the Germans, while a Body of 30000 Tartars tracing up higher towards the River's Head, with the Help of some Hungarians that served as Guides, passed as far as Kirment and St. Godart, and so with some Difficulty having got over the little Raab, they spread themselves with the cruelles Devastation imaginable, round about Newsier Lake, and so on as far as Druck and the Castle
of Harrack, which put a Stop to their Proceeding that Way. This put the People into the terribest Consternation in the World; And so it did, indeed, the main Army it self, which was now, as it were, hemm'd in between the Turks and Tartars, which made the Duke of Lorrain, by the Advice of his Officers, resolve upon a Retreat; and to make the same as safe as he could, he resolved to separate the Foot and Artillery from the Horse, ordering the former to be carried over to the Isle of Shutt, through which they might safely march to Vienna, as they did by the Way of Presburg and Thebe on the other side of the Danube, as the Duke also continued his Retreat with the Cavalry, by a Bridge that had been laid over the Rabeitz; And so the Army got safe to the Plains of Kitzen, where the general Rendezvous had been held about 20 Months before, and from whence, understanding that the Grand Visier ad∣vanced towards him, as supposing the Duke's Retreat to be a plain Flight, he continued his March towards Vienna, having sent Count Caprara before him to give the Emperor an Account of all his Proceedings. When the Duke had passed Wolfdale and Hainburg, he encamped, July 6. at Dutch-Altemburg; from whence the Army marching very early next Day, and the Bag∣gage, for its greater Security, being ordered to keep before; it so happened that a Body of Tartars mixt with Turks and Hun∣garian Guides, to the Number in all of 3000, having swam the River Leitha, sallied out of a little adjacent Wood, and with an horrible Cry, fell so upon some part of the Duke's Left Wing, which followed the Baggage at the Head of the Army, that they forced them to retreat in much Disorder, and by it put the Ranks behind them into Confusion, which gave the Tartars▪The Tartars attack the Germans Opportunity to fall hastily (as their Custom is) upon the Baggage, and the Attendants of the Army, who were put to the Sword, and the Baggage and Waggons plunder'd. The Duke of Sax Lawenburg, the Duke of Croy, and Count Ca∣prara, lost all their Plate and Horses. However the Germans, after they had a little recovered themselves out of the Con∣fusion, stood stoutly to it, and repulsed the Enemy: And upon this Occasion Lewis William, Marquess of Baden, gave a signal Proof of his Valour, by rallying and bringing into Fight some Troops he found in Disorder, and at a Distance, and slew se∣veral of the Tartars, who thereupon fled in great haste; tho', besides the Loss already mentioned, there fell also on the Ger∣man side young Prince Lewis of Saxony, and the young Duke of Arschot; which last was cut to pieces with a Scimeter, after he had received several Musket-Shots. The Emperor,Great Con∣sternation at Vienna. upon the Intelligence brought him by Count Caprara, of the Posture of Things, withdrew from Vienna unto Lintz; which, together with the Waggons and Baggage of the Army coming in an ungovern'd and disorderly Manner under
the Walls of the Town, did so terrifie the Inhabitants, that no Man was willing to stay behind; all the Horses, Waggons and Carts that could be found were immediately hired, and the Waggons and Carriages filled with all sorts of Persons, who could take away with them only what was most valuable, an took up the least room: And in short, nothing but Cries and La∣mentations were to be heard in every Place, as if the Turks had been already Masters of Vienna, and this lasted all that Af∣ternoon. But while these Things were in Agitation, they dis∣covered from Vienna the Village of Vishamund, where the Duke was encamp'd July 7. and another little Place hard by it, all on a Fire, which still doubled the Consternation of the Inhabi∣tants; so that as many as remained behind upon the Emperor's going away, looked upon themselves now as quite undone. However, this Fear blew over again, by the News that soon after came, that the foresaid Places were not fired by the Ene∣my, but by the Carlessness of the Suttlers and others that fol∣lowed the Camp; and at last they grew pretty secure, when they saw the Duke of Lorain, July 8. with Drums beating and Trumpets sounding, come in good Order with his whole Ca∣valry by the Walls of the Town, and passing the Bridge over a Branch of the Danube, about half a Mile above Vienna, which forms an Island there, and where the Duke posted himself with his Cavalry. But he was no sooner lodged there, than that the very next Day a great Conflagration was seen both far and near, all being in Flames, especially towards the Frontiers of Hungary, where not only all manner of Edifices, but even the Fruits and Product of the Earth, were consumed with Fire: Neither did the Province of Austria it self fare better, all be∣ing laid desolate as far as Newstadt, beside the bloody Carnage made of the innocent Inhabitants; and all this by the barbarous Tartars. Things being in this Posture without, and the Enemy still approaching, all Hands were set on work to put the Town in a Posture of Defence, by clearing the Ditches, erecting Pallisa∣does upon the Counterscarp, and every Body appeared very active in the Matter, and so much the more, since Count Sta∣remberg, who had some Days before left the Foot and Artillery, marching slowly towards Vienna, took the Appearance of some Troops upon the Hill of St. Mark, not for his own Men, but for the Forlorn of the Enemy's Army, sent before to make way for the main Body to form a Siege, as they were in reality; which put him also upon making further Preparations of De∣fence, by setting the Suburbs on fire; tho' that could not give the Inhabitants that Satisfaction as the Approach of their Foot did, who, July 13. and the Day following came up, as did also several Bodies of the Enemy, with this difference, that the Turks encamped between the Town and the South-side of the
Danube, whereas the Imperial Foot marched on the other side of the River, without Resistance, and through the Island of St. Leopold, entered Vienna about Midnight, to the inspeakable Joy of the Inhabitants; and as many of them as were necessa∣ry, were distributed by Count Staremberg the Governour, to their several Posts, there being before not above 2000 Men in the Place.The Turks form the Siege of Vienna. The Turks posted themselves about the City on the 14th, in the Form of an Half-Moon; and 2 Days after, when they had made their Trenches at least 2 Yards deep, to secure themselves from the Shot of the Besieged, they began to throw in their Bombs, tho' with little Success: However, they continued to advance their Works and Trenches towards the Court and lebel Bastions, and even by the 16th had got almost within 30 Paces of the Ditch, notwithstanding the continual firing made upon them from within. They raised at first 3 Batteries towards the Bastion aforementioned; which, in a little time, they reduced into one great one, from whence they played with great Fury, as they did also with their Mor∣tars; So that on the 10th a great Bomb falling upon the Spa∣nish Ambassador's Lodging, destroyed all the Noblemens Stables that were built under that part of the Rampart where it fell, but the Fire at length by the Governour's Care was put out; And to prevent as much as might be, such a Conflagration for the future, all the Roofs of Houses that were of Wood, were ordered to be pulled down; the Governour in his own Person giving Example of his Obedience thereunto. And because they perceived the Enemy carrying on double Lines of Com∣munication for the joyning of their Trenches, the Governour ordered a Sally to be made under Count Guido of Staremberg, which was executed with that Success, that many of the Turkish Miners were killed or taken, and amongst the rest one who gave the Governour Misinformation of many Things relating to the Enemies Camp; However, he was mightily concerned about giving the Duke of Lorain Intelligence of the State of Things, and to that End promised publickly an 100 Ducats to any one that would undertake to carry a Letter over the Da∣nube to him; But there was none found that would adventure it at that time, tho' the Duke had better Success on his part in a Thing of the same kind; For on the 21st a Messenger ar∣rived from him safe in the Town, by swimming over the Branch∣es of the Danube, and escaping all the Sentinels of the Ene∣my that were upon the Shoar. The Letters which he brought, were fastned to a Bladder, and hung about his Neck, wherein the Duke encouraged the Besieged to be of good Cheer; for that the Enemy would be shortly forced by a pitch'd Battel to raise the Siege, great Succours being expected from the Empire and Hereditary Countries, as also from the King of Poland, who was on his March, and already advanced as far as Olmutz.
But all this while the Turks were not idle; for after they had possessed themselves of the Island of St. Leopold, they terribly battered the Town from thence,A Journal of the Siege, from the Beginning to the End. and did great Damage, and carried on their Designs with great Caution and Secresie. But on the 22d there were Letters brought to the Governour from Christopher Caunitz, the Emperor's Resident at the Port, and who was now detained in the Turkish Camp, that gave him some Information of Things (tho' this Correspondence quickly ceased) for the Thing was so generally talked of in Town, that the Grand Viier came to hear it, and so took care to secure the Messenger that went back with the Governour's Answer, (who, however cunningly dropp'd the Letters that were covered with a Ball of black Wax by the Way) so that the very next Day every Family was ordered to provide a Man to watch in their Cellars, and to give notice of any Noise of digging they should hear; But the Enemy sprung 2 Mines that same Evening to∣wards the outward Angle of the Counterscarp, tho' without any considerable Effect. On the 25th, the Turks towards E∣vening began to keep Holy-day, with an hideous Noise of Bells and Pipes, their ordinary Musick, which, when some of the Christians heard from the Place where they kept Guard, upon the Edge of the Ditch, which was not 10 Foot distant, they invited the Turks to dance with them, that so the Musick might not be lost, but they had quickly other Sport; For the Turks sprung a Mine under the Pallisadoes, which blew up many of themselves as well as the Christians; tho' the Enemy attempt∣ed thereupon to enter into the Ditch, by the Breach, their Mine had made; which occasioned a smart Encounter, with considerable Loss on both sides: And, amongst others hurt this Day, the Governour himself received a Wound in the Hand. But it unfortunately happened the Day follow∣ing, that the Messenger which the Duke of Lorain sent with Letters to the City, as he was going back the same Way with an Answer in Cypher, was intercepted by the Ene∣my; of which they gave the Besieged notice, by tying the said Letters to an Arrow, and shooting the same into the Town, with the Addition of the following Words; That it was in vain for them to endeavour to send Letters to their Army, the miserable State of Vienna being sufficiently known to all the World; which was but a just Judgment of God Almighty, in punishing the Christians for the Breach of their Faith; whereby they had provo∣ked the Emperor of the Turks to that Expedition. The Turks continued their Approaches for the following Days towards the Counterscarp, and the Christians still defended themselves by all proper Methods; and, amongst others, they sprung a Mine, July 30. in the Enemies Trenches, with very good Suc∣cess, and obliged them to spend a good part of the next Day in making good their Trenches, and the Remainder in carry∣ing
on their Mines; which they did so far towards the Ditch, that they and the Germans could not only talk together, but they fell foul upon one another with pieces of Sticks and Palli∣fadoes; till at last, the Christians taking up the Iron Hooks, which they made use of in their Works, and hooking in the Turks, drew them within their Trenches; or else, fixing Sythes to long Poles, struck at the Enemy through the Pallisadoes, and killed all they could reach with them; but that did not hinder the Besiegers to ply the Town with Bombs; and not on∣ly so,: but to carry on their Trenches with great Diligence; whilst the Germans endeavoured in vain, with their Bombs and Granadoes, to disturb them: It was their Practice, as soon as they had made their Trenches, to cover them immediately with great Pieces of Wood, over which they laid Boards, and Bags of Sand; where they secured themselves so well from the Shot of the Christians, that the Baha's, and even the Grand Visier himself, taking these Trenches for their safe Retreat, ordered them to be made very large and spacious, and to be divided with several Appartments, which they paved with Tyles, and furnished with Tapestry; where nothing was wanting that was necessary for the Convenience of Li∣ving. It was now Aug. 1. when the Enemy, in the Night, threw up the Earth from the Trenches at least 3 Yards higher than the Places where the Christians kept Guard, endeavouring from thence to burn the Pallisadoes; But the Men that defend∣ed them opposed the Enemy with great Courage, and beat them back, while others fetch'd Water from the Bottom of the Ditch, and put out the Fire: Tho' this was not effected with∣out the Loss of a great many Men on both sides, but of a great∣ter to the Turks the next Day, by springing a Mine which the Christians had carried from the Lebel Bastion, to their very Works, and which blew up a great many of them: To which was added soon after, the Burning of the Boats the Turks had brought together at the Island of St. Leopold, by a Party of Germans that sallied out of the Town; whom the Governour generously rewarded for so fortunate an Undertaking. But the Turks were so far from being discouraged herewith, that on Aug. 3. at Night they attacked the Counterscarp, having for that End thrown up Earth for many Days over the Pallisa∣does, whereby they got above the Germans, and from thence fought Hand to Hand against them, with Guns, Scimeters and Javelins; the Infidels basely shooting vast Numbers of poy∣son'd Arrows against the Christians: However, the Christians stood stoutly to it still, and maintained their Posts: And the Turks, on the other side, were also as obstinate; for, after the first Attack, they sprung a Mine upon the outward Angle of the Counterscarp, which broke the Earth thereabout, near the
Palisadoes; from which, tho' the Germans retreated a little at first, yet some of them ventured presently after to fix them up anew, while others drove away the Turks from the Posts they had gained. They continued still firing, both from their Guns and Mortars, with wonderful Fury the succeeding Days; by which, and throwing Hand-Granadoes, they were enabled, notwithstanding all the Endeavours of the Christians to the Contrary, to throw up so much Earth upon the Counterscarp, that, carrying it before them, they filled the Ditch of the Ravelin, in order to make their Assault the more easie: But the Christians withstood them with all imaginable Courage; and the Governour himself was almost every where present; encouraging the Soldiers, and calling them Brothers: And Aug. 6. at 4 in the Morning, he ordered a little Bed to be brought to the Place where the Emperor's Guards used to lodge, that he might be nearer at hand on all Occasions. But, tho' the Duke of Lorrain was able to beat Teckely, who was ra∣vaging Moravia, near the River Marow, and to force him to retreat to his former Station upon the Waag, he was not then in a Condition to relieve the Town; and so the Siege was press'd on; And Aug. 7. at Night, there was a sharp Com∣bate between the Besieged and the Enemy, who keeping the high Ground, were exposed on all sides to the Shot of the German Out-guards, who were lodged upon a Level with them, upon the Side of the Ditch: Whereupon, they threw up a great deal of Earth, in order to secure themselves, and then began to fill up the Ditch with the Earth, to make it even with the Counterscarp and the Ravelin, to facilitate their At∣tack: And, tho' the Germans endeavoured with all Privacy to wheel away the Earth, the Turks discovered them; and rush∣ing out of their Trenches and Galleries towards the Lebel Ba∣stion, they drove away the Besieged with a considerable Slaugh∣ter; and all the Day following continued their Works with great Diligence, carrying on their Mine to the very Ditch of the Ravelin; which the Germans observing, and fearing they would attack the Ravelin, they drew off their great Guns from thence, and planted them upon the Walls of the Town, but left some Men upon the Ravelin, to annoy the Enemy with Small-shot: That Night Count Daune and Count Souches, by Direction from the Governour (who was then sick) made a vi∣gorous Sally with 300 Men, and succeeded so well, that they set fire to the Enemies Galleries, by which they made their Passage into the Bottom of the Ditch, but they returned a∣gain to their Galleries, repaired the Damage, and next Day sprung a Mine in the Ditch of the Ravelin, which did the Besieged's Works considerable Damage. For the further Par∣ticulars of this Siege, from hence to Aug. 19. I think they cannot be better given you, than by Count Staremberg's Let∣ter
to the Duke of Lorain upon this Occasion, which was to this Purpose: AVGVST 17. 1683. GOD be thanked,Count Sta∣remberg's Letter to the Duke of Lorain. one of my Letters has had the good Fortune to come to your Highness's Hands: You would have received many more since the 22d past, had I found Per∣sons fit to carry them, in which many have miscarried; and it will not be my Fault, if your Highness be not oftner and better informed for the future, that your Highness may bet∣ter know our Condition. I will first tell you, that hitherto we have disputed every Foot of Ground with the Enemy; and what they have gained, they have paid dear for, having, as often as they attempted to lodge themselves, been very vigorously repulsed by us with our Swords in our Hands, with so great Loss on their side, that they now hardly dare shew themselves out of the Holes and Hills, with which they have surrounded their Attack of the Counterscarp. Your Highness understood by my last, that the Enemy had made a Descent▪ into the Ditch of the Ravelin, and that they blew up part of the Wall; whereas they did then so, so have they several times since made an Assault, but, God be thanked, without Success. We have likewise several times beaten them from the Post they had taken at the Foot of the Breach; but as soon as our Men retired, they returned thither again. I have thereupon used what Precaution I could, and have caused Pits to be made in the Point of the Ravelin, and done whatever else might most annoy the Enemy. I have done the like in the Bastions they attack, where they have yet attained no Ground, remaining still on the Edge of the Counterscarp. The 14th they made a Descent thro' the Ditch before the Ba∣stion called Lebel, and the same Night they made another great Lodgment in the Ditch; whereupon perceiving that we could not much incommode them there, neither with our Great nor Small Shot, because they lay too low in the Ground; I employed our Cannon against their Works, and secured our Passage into the Ditch, and attacking them 3 several times, we beat them from thence. In the first Attack our Men were not strong enough to ruine their Works, but the Wind being favourable, burnt their Gabeons, and almost all their Gallery; and since that, they have not made any further Attack upon the Ravelin on that side. Yesterday they sprung a Mine, but without any Success. We have made in the middle of the Ravelin a good Retrenchment with a good Ditch. The Ba∣stions of Lebel and that of the Court have likewise double Re∣trenchments; and I am now making a Retrenchment behind
those 2 Bastions; so that your Highness may see we are not wanting in any Thing on our part; and I assure you, I will never surrender the Place, but with the last Drop of my Blood. For the rest, our Men do not fear the Enemy; and, Thanks be to God, 30 or 40 of ours have always beaten and dislodged 100 of theirs. This Day was brought to me a Ja∣nizary Prisoner, who, among other Things, tells me, That they have lost in the Attacks they have made 10000 Men, a great many Officers and Janizaries, and the Bassa's of Meso∣potomia and Albania; and that they seem to suffer very much for want of Forage and Victuals, which they are forced to go a great Way for, and that they are expecting a Convoy from Macedonia. For what concerns my self, I have had the Bloody Flux these 8 Days, but am at present somewhat better; however, that made me not neglect my Duty, for I was car∣ried where I could not go. Your Highness will comfort us with your Presence, and do me the Favour to believe that I am, &c. P. S. Since Yesterday the Enemy have again sprung a Mine under the Ravelin, and given an Assault with 10000 Men, whom we received very well with our Great and Small Shot, and in Conclusion they made an inconsiderable Lodgement, though with the Loss of 300 of their Men; but this Morning I sprung a Mine which dislodged them, and buried a great Number of them. I expect at this Mi∣nute the like Entertainment from them; and if I can be ready before them, I will spring one more to your Highness's Health. On the 20th of Aug. the Turks thundered with their great Guns and Bombs upon the City Bastions after their usual Man∣ner, as they did also the Day after, springing a Mine withal, which yet did no great Execution; the same Work continued on both sides till the 22th, when the Messenger, whom the Go∣vernour had sent to the Duke of Lorain, returned with Let∣ters from his Highness into the Town, which greatly encoura∣ged the Besieged; for he signified to them thereby, That the Armies were almost joined; That the Troops of Bavaria, Saxony, Franconia, the Poles and Imperialists, were near Crembs; That the King of Poland was hastning thither in Person, as was also the Electors of Bavaria and Saxony, and the Emperor himself coming to Lintz, that he might be nearer the Army; but that the whole Enterprize depended upon the brave De∣fence they should make, until the Armies were joined, which was hoped would be before the End of the Month; That in the mean time the Duke of Lorain was moving towards
Crembs, to forward the Bridges that were making there; That nothing was omitted that might contribute to so necessary and honourable a Relief; and that his Highness was resolved rather to hazard all, than that the City should be lost; That he had beaten Tekely near Presburg, and taken all his Bag∣gage, &c. and that Presburg, which had been lately surrender'd to Tekely, was now under the Emperor's Obedience; and that he had also beaten the Count a second time near the Ma∣row. But if this Information from his Highness heightned the Resolution of the Besieged, the Turks persisted as obsti∣nate in their Attacks, and carrying on of their Works; as ap∣pears by another Letter of Count Staremberg to the Duke of Lorain. AVGVST 27. 1683. I Cast my self at your Highness's Feet, most humbly to thank you for the Goodness you was pleased to express towards me in your last Letter. Your Highness knows I am perfectly devoted to you, and that I desire nothing more passionately, than by most humbly Service to render my self worthy there∣of. Since my last the Enemy have sprung 6 or 7 Mines in the Ravelin, which, after having repulsed them, we present∣ly repaired again, and we still maintain our Intrenchments, the Enemy having hitherto gained no more than a Lodge∣ment on the Point of the Ravelin. We search above and under Ground, and have countermined 3 of the Enemies Mines, and sprung 2 Mines, which had good Effect; and would have had much better, were our Miners more brave and expert; but being People which we get together any way, its impossible to make them re-enter a Mine, when they once hear the Enemy at work in the Counterscarp. The E∣nemy have likewise sprung 3 Mines near the Retrenchment pallisadoed, which we still maintain to cover the Caponers we have in the Ditch; and though the Pallisadoes were in some places beaten down by the last Mine, yet our Men with their Swords in their Hands, maintained the Post, till such time as they were made good again, and we do still keep it. The Enemy have made again 2 Descents into the Ditch, the one towards the Bastion of Lebel, and the other towards that of the Court, from whence our Men did in open Day, under the favour of the Fire we made upon the Enemy 2 Hours to∣gether, very bravely dislodge them, while others, command∣ed for that Purpose, filled up their Works, and burnt their Gabeons and Galleries, so that they must now begin again. But, Sir, its time to succour us, we lose a great many Men, and many Officers, more by the Bloody Flux than by the Fire
of the Enemy; for there dies almost every Day 60 of this Distemper. We have no more Granadoes, which were our best Defence. Our Cannon are partly spoiled by the Enemy, and partly burst, not having endured 50 Shot, by reason of the Badness of their Metal: And the Enemy finding they cannot with small Numbers lodge themselves in the Ditch, they make great Lodgments on the Counterscarp, to keep a great Number of Men there, and to make an extraordinary Effort. For the rest, it is certain, that the Enemy have lost, and do still lose every Day, a great many Janizaries; and that they have many wounded; and sick of the same Distemper which reigns amongst them. They have several Camps; far enough from each other, and may be easily broken if they stay for Your Highness here, which I do not believe they will do. They are not at present 80000 fighting Men; and one Camp may be beaten, before it can be assisted by the other. We expect Your Highness with the greatest Impati∣ence; But I do not so much desire to be delivered out of this Siege, as to have the Honour to assure Your Highness of the Respect with which I am, &c. P. S. At this Instant my Miners inform me, That they hear the Enemy working beneath them, under the Bastion of the Court: They must have passed the Ditch, under Ground; and there is no more Time to be lost. Aug. the 28th, the Turks sprung a Mine on the Right-side of the attack'd Ravelin, and withal made an Assault, but were beaten off. Next Day they sprung another Mine, with such Success, that it utterly destroyed the Ravelin, saving a little Retrenchment the Germans had on the middle of it, which they still maintained for some Days very obstinately; but be∣ing beset on every side, the Governour ordered that Post to be abandoned; so that the Enemy still made their Approach∣es; when on the 1st of Sept. they were busie in advancing their Works towards the Bastion, the Germans sallied upon them, and drove the Turks to the Counterscarp, entring into their Trenches as far as a Battery, where they nailed up 2 of their great Guns; but the Christians were at last repulsed into the Town, with some Loss; when perceiving the Enemy intended to carry a Mine under the Court Bastion, and to that End had already made their Approaches in the Bottom of the Ditch, to the Lebel Bastion, they threw several Rockets that Night into the Air, as a Signal to the Christian Army, that they stood in great need of Relief: For, tho' the Messenger that had been sent to the Duke of Lorain twice before returned with com∣fortable News to the Besieged, to the Town the next Day, he
was dispatched away that same Evening to the Duke again, to press him to hasten his Succours, for the Enemy had that very Day sprung their Mine under the Left-side of the Court-Bastion so successfully, that the Garrison were very apprehen∣sive lest the Turks should find a Passage, so as to lodge them∣selves within the Bastion; and that carrying the Mine far∣ther, the whole Structure would be endamaged. On the 3d they fully possessed themselves of the Ravelin; and on the 4th, about 2 in the Afternoon, they sprung another Mine un∣der the Left ace of the Court-Bastion, which made so terrible a Noise and Concussion, that half the Town was shaken with it, and at least .30 Foot of the Bastion thrown down; which the Ene∣my seconding with an Assault, and their usual Cry of Alla, Alla, put the whole City into the greatest Consternation imaginable; but the Germans that had the Guard of that Post, immediate∣ly stopping the Breach with great Beams, and Sacks filled with Sand and Earth, after a desperate Fight, most gallantly repul∣sed the Enemy; as they did also 1000 Turks more, who ap∣peared on the Top of the Ditch, whom they forced, with great Slaughter on both sides, to their first Post, under the Bastion: Yet the Place was too open, and the Enemy still too near, and therefore the Besieged repeated their Signal from St. Stephen's Tower, and the same Day sent a Letter to the Duke of Lorain, to let him once more know their Extremity, which the Enemy was not insensible of, and therefore they plied them with their heavy Cannon on the 5th of Sept. and in the Evening they endeavoured to regain the Ground they had lost upon the Court-Bastion, though without Success: But having on the 6th sprung severall Mines under the Lebel-Bastion, they made such a Breach, that a great part of the Bastion, which was at least 20 Foot thick, was quite thrown down, from top to bottom, leaving a Gap of 36 Foot broad; and the Besieged quite uncovered: Whereupon, the Enemy made a furious Assault, but by reason of the Difficulty of the Passage, could not then prevail: However, the Night follow∣ing they fell upon digging new Passages through the Breach; which made the Germans once more give a Signal to the Duke of Lorain, by Rockets, that their Circumstances were now such as required immediate Relief; and, at the same time, spent that Night in making what Defences they could by l∣lisadoes, new Batteries, and the like; which, while they were busying themselves about, they saw 5 Rockets upon the Top of the Calemburg, as a certain Signal that their expected Succours were at hand; and which they readily answered in the same Manner from the Town. Of this the Grand Visier seemed to be aware, by the general Muster he made of his Army the next Day, but at the same time continued his Works with all manner of Diligence, as they did also the succeeding Day,
when with some more lines they blew up another piece of the Bastion, but yet not so much as to give them free Passage▪ as they desired; so that in the 2 Assaults they here made, they were both times repulsed: And yet the same Night, tho' a Prisoner gave the Besieged an Account of the Confusion the Turks were in by reason of the approaching Succours, they thought it convenient, for all that, to make another Signal to the Duke, from St. Stephen's Tower; and the rather, since the Turks seemed still obstinate in carrying on their Attacks, which they continued, with no very great Advantage, till the 11th of Sept. when that same Afternoon they drew all their Forces out of their Camp, and marched towards the Calemburg, (which was a certain Sign to the Besieged, that their Succours were marching that way;) and taking the Advantage of the Night, endeavoured to get up the Hill, whilst the Christian Arm met them in the Descent: At that time the Be∣sieged also had the Satisfaction to see the Rockets which were thrown up on the Top of the Hill, as a Signal of their Approach, and which they expected with so much Im∣patience. The next Day, which was the 12th of Sept. after Sun-rising, the Christian Army advanced from the upper part of the Ca∣lemburg, moving slowly, in close Order, from the Carthusian Monastery, and St. Leopold's Chappel, and extending it self more and more until they made their way out of the Forest, when they closed their Lines, and marching towards the Plain, left a Space for them that followed, and room for themselves to move in, their Cannon playing upon the Enemy at several Intervals. But the Turks were guilty of a very great Over∣sight, in not securing the Passages of the Wood, or other ad∣vantageous Posts, which the Christians found difficult enough to pass, tho' they met with no Opposition▪ but, perhaps, the former vainly trusted to their Numbers, having still an Army of an 120000 fighting Men, tho' they had lost near 60000 at the Siege, whereas the Christian Army without, was not above 80000 and 6000 within the Town, who yet did good Service upon this Occasion. The Right Wing of the Army was given to the King of Poland, for that he had most Horse, and that the Country was open on that side; the Left, to the Elector of Bavaria and the Duke of Lorrain, because they were strongest in the Foot, and that the Country was inclosed on that side all along the Danube, and the main Body to the Elector of Saxony, and Prince Waldeck; In this Disposition, the Generals, that Morn∣ing, according to Appointment, met upon the Hill, to give the necessary Orders, and were no sooner come together, but a Body of 10000 Turks appear'd, and advanced towards the Christians; whereupon a Battallion was ordered to post them∣selves
in a Vineyard, that was on an Hill hard by, being sup∣ported by 3 other Battallions, which made the Turks stop: For, not enduring the Fire of those Battallions, and being all Horse, and in a Ground where they could not well attack the Foot, they contented themselves to make one Discharge, accompa∣nied with an hideous Noise, and so retired: Whereupon the King of Poland, and the other Princes having observed the the Disposition of the Enemy, drew the Army into 3 Lines, and closed without any Intervals as before mentioned, and or∣dered them to march very slowly towards the Enemy, and to stand, when the Turks came to Charge them, keeping them∣selves very close, and not to fire till the Enemy had made their Discharge, which was exactly performed; for the Enemy ad∣vanced towards them with an horrible Cry, as if they meant to break in upon them, hoping thereby to make them give way, or to put them into Disorder; But finding the Christians stood firm, and expecting them in a very close Order, they durst not push any further, but halted, and still finding the Christians did not stir, but stood expecting them, they then made their Discharge, and wheeled off. Upon this, the first Line of the Chri∣stians fired, and that done, the whole Army advanced slowly, and so gained Ground upon the Enemy, who returning, came up as before; the Christians thereupon made an Halt, and expected them, and the Turks having made their Discharge, retired again, which they repeated several times without adventuring to break in upon the Christians, who still gained Ground, driving the Turks before them, like a Flock of Sheep: Being come near the Enemies Camp, a Body of Foot and Dragoons were detach'd to attack their Cannon, which they made themselves Masters of with∣out any great Opposition; the Enemy having but a small Number of Foot to defend them, and even their Horse made no great Resistance any where, tho' they endeavoured on the side of the Right Wing to Charge the Christians in Flank, which the King of Poland mistrusting, caused part of the se∣cond Line to advance, and make a Front on that side, and charging the Enemy in Person with the first Line, made them give way. During the hottest of the Battle, the Turks attackt the Town, and put the Besieged so to it, that Count Starem∣berg was forced to send to the Duke of Lorain for Assistance; whereupon the Duke sent Prince Lewis of Baden with a Body of Horse; Foot, and Dragoons into the City, with whose Help all the Turks that were in the Attack, where cut to pieces. In short, towards Evening, the Enemy began to give way, and fled, being pursued by the Christians beyond their Camp, and there they made an Halt, the Soldiers upon pain of Death, be∣ing Commanded not to stir out of their Ranks, and the whole Army remained all Night in Battle array, as if the Enemy had been still present. Next Day the Camp was Plundered, half
a Company going out at a time, while the other half continued at their Arms, and when they returned, these went out in like manner. All the Enemies Baggage, Provision, Tents, 50 Pieces of Cannon, 2 Horse-Tails, the Grand Seignior's Standard, and the Visier's own Horse were taken, and most of their Foot cut in pieces, being computed at about 15000, the rest having perished during the Siege; and the Victory was so much the more glorious to the Christian Arms, in, that they lost not above a 1000 Men in all, and very few Persons of Note, the Duke of Croy, and some others being wounded, and that the Capital of the German Empire, was hereby relieved, which otherwise must inevitably have fallen into the Hands of the Infidels, in less than 48 Hours more, (having already endured 9 Weeks Siege,) for want of Provisions, and a sufficient Gar∣rison to defend it longer, their Number being diminished one half, and the Turkish Mines ready to blow up the last Re∣trenchments they had for its Security. And because it is fit the Memory of those Great Men that appeared this Day at the Head of the Christian Army, and under whose Conduct this signal Victory was obtained, should by all just Means be perpetnated to future Generations; they were these that fol∣low: The King of Poland, the Electors of Saxony and Bavaria, the Duke of Lorain, Prince Waldeck, General of the Empire, the 2. Princes of Baden, the Prince of Anhalt, the Duke of Croy, the Prince de Salm, the Margrave of brandenburg Ba∣eith, the Landtgrave of Hesse, the Prince of Hanover, the 2 Princes of Neuburg, 4 Princes of the House of Saxony, and 3 of Wirtemburg, the Prince of Hoenzeller, and some others. The King of Poland next Day after the Battle, and the E∣lector of Bavaria, having visited all the Enemies Works and Approaches, and with all Expressions of Kindness, having ta∣ken leave of the Elector of Saxony, and the Duke of Lorain, entred the Town, the King causing the Visier's Standard to be carried before him, as he went attended by a small Retinue of his own Subjects, to the Chappel of Loretto, to sing Te Deum for this great and memorable Victory; after which, he was accompanied with his Son Prince Alexander, who was cloath∣ed in the German Habit, to Count Staremberg's House, where with the Elector of Bavaria, and many of the Polish Nobility, as also Count Statgottz, who had been sent as Envoy from the Emperor to the King; they were all sumptuously Entertained, and the King in the Evening retired from thence to his Tent. The Emperor also, on his part, was no sooner informed of the good News, by a Person sent on Purpose to him, from the Duke of Lorain, but he hasted to Vienna, and arrived there on the 14th; where, after he had visited the Enemies Works, and the Fortifications of the Town, he enter'd at the Hungari∣ Gate, between the Electors of Saxony and Bavaria: He went
to St. Stephen's Church, where Te Deum was sung, with a tripple Discharge of the Cannon. When the Service of the Church was over, Emerius, Bishop of Vienna, took Occasion to repre∣sent to the Emperor, how that in 1529, when Solyman the Magnificent came in Person, with an Army of 200000 Men, to besiege Vienna, that then, at the Prayer of the Besieged, he did forbear to shoot at St. Stephen's Tower, as being a very ar∣tificial and beautiful Fabrick: In acknowledgment of which Fa∣vour, the Citizens had then, by Agreement, placed on the Pi∣nacle of the Tower an Half Moon and a Star, which are the Turkish Arms; and they were yet remaining in the same Place: But that the Turks having now, in Violation of that Agreement, continually fired upon that Tower, and done it much Preju∣dice, the Bishop, for that Reason, humbly prayed his Imperial Majesty, to grant him Leave to pull down the Turkish Arms, and to erect the Cross instead of it: Which, with the Empe∣ror's Approbation, was immediately effected. After this, the Emperor had an Interview with the King of Poland, at the Head of his Army, in his Camp; and thanked him for the ge∣nerous Assistance he had given him, and all Christendom, upon this great Occasion: And the King having returned the Com∣plement, the Emperor returned to Vienna, and shewed Marks of his Favour to all the Princes and Great Men that had signa∣lized themselves in the Action. But the Elector of Saxony, af∣ter this, returning soon Home with his Army, occasioned vari∣ous Interpretations. The Polish and Imperial Armles having a little refreshed themselves, they resolved to pursue the Victory; and to that End, passing by Presburg, they advanced on the 9th of Oct. to∣wards the Fort of Barkan,The Battel of Barkan. which covers the Bridge of Gran; the Imperialists having the Van-Guard: Near this Fort there were about 14000 Turks encamped, being the best Troops of their remaining Army; who being encouraged with the Ad∣vantage they had a little before, near the said Place, over the Poles, who were forced to retreat to the Body of the Imperia∣lists, not then come up: They no sooner saw the Christian Ar∣my appear, but they advanced with a full Speed, and a most hideous Cry, briskly charging the Imperialists, and endea∣vouring to break in upon them: But the Christians kept them∣selves very close and firm, and vigorously repulsed the Enemy, who then turned towards the Poles, and made a very fierce Charge upon them; they were likewise received by the Poles with great Bravery, who, being very well seconded by the Im∣perialists, made a great Slaughter of the Enemy, who seeing one of their Basha's slain, and another taken, fled towards Barkan, being pursued very close by the Christians, who fired upon them with their Cannon, which the King of Poland and the Duke of Lorain caused to advance for that Purpose. Some
of the Enemy got over the Bridge of Gran, which happily broke to the Advantage of the Christians; others threw themselves into Barkan, while several of them were drowned; and many taken Prisoners; so that of the whole Body, there could not above 4000 escape. This being done, the Imperial Foot and Dragoons advanced, and the Regiment of Castelli, with some other commanded Troops, attacked the Counter∣scarp of Barkan, being led on by the Count de Staremberg, and took it with their Swords in their Hands, putting all the Turks that were there to the Sword, but gave Quarter to  Jani∣zaries I that were in the place, who surrender'd at Discretion. They found 20 Pieces of Cannon in that Fortress, great Quan∣tities of Ammunition and Provisions, with many fine Horses, and very rich Furniture. This place the Duke thought once to demolish; but upon better Consideration, he ordered it to be repaired, and putta good Garrison into it; and on Oct. 20, he passed the Danube with the Imperial Army, moving towards Gran; the King of Poland at the same time, being reinforced with the Lithuanian Troops, marched towards Agri. The Duke,Gran besie∣ged by the Germans. who had been before re-joined by the Elector of Bavarina, (who was forced to leave the Army after the Battel of Vienna, by reason of his Illness,) with 7000 Foot, near Barkan, with so considerable a Reinforcement, sat down before Gran; and ha∣ving understood by some Prisoners that were taken, that the Turks who were posted in the Fort upon St. Thomas's Hll had Orders, as soon as they perceived the Christians approach to attack them, to retire into the Cittadel, His Highness resolved to intercept them; and to that purpose he commanded the Count de Scherffenberg, being supported by 2 Regiments of Horse, to invest the Hill, and take the said Fort; which was accordingly performed, and of 380 Janizaries that defended the place, 180 were killed, and the rest made Prisoners: Yet before , the Turks had set fire to the Buildings in that Fort, but the Christians saved most of them. The Duke of Lorain be∣came in this manner no sooner Master of the Hill, but he cau∣sed a Battery to be raised upon it, which did very much annoy the Turks, who abandoned the Town, and retired into the Cit∣tadel; this made the Christians re-double their Efforts, and carry  their Attack so vigorously, th on Oct. 27, which was but the third Day after opening of the Trenches, the Turks de∣sired to capitulate; which the Duke, considering the Season of the Year, consented to. The Articles being agreed on, the Turks 000 out, to the number of  Janizaries, and 000 of the Inhabitants, and were conducted several Miles by an Im∣perial Convoy, in their Way to  The Conquest of Gran by the Imperial Arms was so much the more engaging, in that, besides 18 Pieces of Cannon, 400000 Pounds of Powder, and good store of Provisions, which they found in the place, they
took it with the oss only of 150 Men, after it had been 78 Years in the Possession of the Turks. So Thoughts there were, after the laking in of Gran, to march directly, and attack Buda; but the Season being far ad∣vanced, it was not judged adviseable; tho' perhaps, consider∣ing the Consternation the Turks were under on every side, that important place might have then been easily carried, which proved afterwards the Work of two Campaigns. Wherefore, after the Army had possessed themselves of some other small Places in the Neighbourhood of Gran, and elsewhere, they went into their Winter Quarters, concluding the Actions of this Year on that side; as we do also with all others that have happened within the Circumference of it; having nothing re∣markable to super-add in this place, save that great and memo∣rable Frost which began about the latter end of November, and lasted for the space of Ten Weeks. What was left unfinished before in relation to the Prosecution of the pretended Presbytenian Plot, was compleated amongst us this Year: And where there could be no colourable Pretence to touch Life and Limb, they were sure to be even with the pre∣tended Criminals by Imprisonments and exorbitant Fines; there being hardly any County in England, wherein some were not severely swinged off for Riots, when they were indeed le∣gally standing up in Defence of their Charters and Civil Liber∣ties, whilst others did as basely betray them. And because His Royal Highness should be as absolute again at Sea as he had shewed himself by Land, both in England and Scotland, His Majesty was pleased to revoke the Commission for High Admi∣ral, and to commit it into his good Brother's Hands again, who took Care to require him well for it. But give me leave to tell you once again,K. Charles contempti∣ble abroad. that the Tories of this Time did not so much magnifie His Majesty's Conduct and Government, as he was diminutively Little in the Esteem of neighbouring Princes. I have given you, some time since, an Hint of the French Pretensions in relation to the Re-anions, and am now to acquaint you, that notwithstanding the French Complement to the Emperor last Year, upon their quitting the Blockade of Luxemburg, That it was done that the Christi∣ans might take no Umbrage at such a Conjuncture, when the Infidels were threatning the Empire with an Invasion; Yet the Year was not expired, but that, in pursuance to the said Pre∣tensions, they surprized, Courtray and Dixmude: Wherewith the Court of Spain was so incensed, that they re-called their Ambassodor, ordered the French Minister to retire home, and seized all the Effects belonging to the French, in their Domini∣ons. Yet the Dutch States were not so hot upon the Matter, and therefore they proposed the King of England's Mediation herein; but the Spaniards would by no means hear of it; say∣ing,
There was but too much Reason to suspect that Prince, since i did appear he had more closely linked himself with France than ever. Hereupon the French King prepared an Army to invade the Spanish Netherlands, while he sent another to infest the Spa∣niards on the side of Catalonia. And if Luxemburg, by an odd Circumstance of Time, or what shall I call it, had the good Luck to escape a Siege last Year, she shall be sure to have her Share in this, and be attacked in Form. The Prince of Orange, ac∣cording to his usual Foresight, had proposed pretty early to the States the Levying of 16000 Men, and to bring all the Troops of the Country into the Field, as a Means to give the French some Umbrage, and to prevent their proceeding to an open Rupture: But he was still opposed in his Designs by the Artifice of the French Ambassador, the Count d'Avaux, who put in se∣veral Memorials to the States upon account of the Conjun∣cture: Insomuch that at last the City of Amsterdam would not consent to the said Levy, but absolutely rejected it: Which, tho' it utterly broke the Prince's Measures, yet it did not his Cou∣rage; for he took the Field, tho' to little purpose: Because the French,Luxemburg besieged by the French and surren∣der'd. who were too quick to let slip the Opportunity, brought a great Army before Luxemburg towards the latter end of May. And tho' the Place, in the Circumstasnces it was then, made a good Resistance, it was on the 10th of June surrender'd upon Articles. And now France having got what she desired, pro∣posed a Truce afresh for 20 Years; to which the States did not seem averse: So that they made the matter up quickly, both for themselves, and Spain, as they had been wont to do, in a manner upon the French Terms; Whereof, take the fol∣lowing Abstract; wherein you will find the King of England's Name mentioned, but mostly for Form sake. I. THE States General oblige themselves to employ all sorts of good Offices to induce the King of Spain to accept of the Truce for 20 Years,The 20 Years Truce. proposed by his most Christi∣an Majesty; during which all Hostilities shall cease between the said Kings, as well by Sea and Land, in all their Countries and Dominions. II. The most Christian King shall, during the said Truce, remain possessed of the City of Luxemburg, and the Provostry thereof, with the 14 or 15 Villages and Hamblets depending thereon; and Beaumount, and the 3 or 4 Villages that remain on its Dependance; Bouvois which has none, and Chimay with the 12 or 14 Villages belonging to it. III. If within 6 Weeks, from the Date of this Convention, the Catholick King shall agree unto, and in due Form ratifie the Articles contained therein, and shall consent to the said Truce of 20 Years upon the Condition proposed, the most Christian King, so soon as the Ratifications are exchanged,
shall restore to the Catholick King Courtray and Dixmuyde (af∣ter having demolish'd the Fortifications) with the Dependen∣cies of those Places. IV. His most Christian Majesty shall likewise restore to the Catholick King, after the Exchange of the Ratifications, all the Places he hath promised himself since Aug. 20, 1683. except Luxemburg, and the other Places mentioned in the Ar∣ticle: And for the rest, the most Christian and Catholick Kings shall remain in the Possession, during the said Truce, of what they held at the raising of the Blockade of Luxemburg, and no Pretension shall be moved, or Re-union made, on the one side or the other, on Account of Dependencies; or any other Pre∣tence whatever. V. After the Exchange of the said Ratifications of Spain, all Acts of Hostility shall cease, and the most Christian King shall withdraw his Troops out of the Countries of the King of Spain wheresoever situated, the King of Spain doing the like on his part. VI. If any Contest shall happen concerning the time of Pos∣session, or the Extent of any Places that are to remain to either side during the said Truce, the Determination thereof shall be referred to the King of Great Britain, provided no Complaint shall be received on this Subject three Months after the Ex∣change of the Spanish Ratifcations. VII. The Contributions shall be continued on both sides till the Day of the Exchange of the Spanish Ratification, and the Arrears then due shall be paid within three Months after; and, during that time, there shall be no Military Execution on that Account; provided the Places give good Security to pay the same; and if any Difference arise concerning the said Contributions, it shall be referred to the Arbitrage of the King of Great Britain. VIII. The most Christian King obliges himself to cause, from this present time, all Hostilities to cease, in the Low Countries, against the Places belonging to the King of Spain, and even in the open Country, in case the Spaniards do abstain from them. IX. In case the King of Spain do not accept the said Truce within the said Term of 6 Weeks, and cause the Ratifications to be furnished in due Form, the States-General do oblige them∣selves immediately afterwards to withdraw their Troops out of the Spanish Netherlands, and not to give the Crown of Spain any Assistance during the present War; and do further oblige themselves not to commit any Hostilities against his Majesty or his Allies; and his most Christian Majesty likewise obliges him∣self not to attack or possess, with his own Troops, or those of his Allies, any Place in the Low-Countries, and even not to make War in the open Country, if the Spaniards do abstain from it.
X. In case the War shall continue, and that his most Chri∣stian Majesty shall make any Conquest upon Spain, his Majesty promises not to accept any Equivalent in the Spanish Netherlands for the Conquests he shall make elsewhere during the present War; and that he will not, during the said time, possess him∣self of any Places in the Low-Countries, either by Revolt, Ex∣change, voluntary Cession, or any other way whetever. XI. His Majesty obliges himself to give a Month longer to the Dyet at Ratisbone to accept the Truce upon the Conditions already offered them. XII. The King of Great Britain, and generally all Princes that are willing to enter into a like Engagement, may be Gua∣rantees of this Treaty. XIII. Nothing shall be innovated in the said Treaty conclu∣ded at Nimeguen between his most Christian Majesty and this State. XIV. This Treaty shall be ratified by his Majesty and the said States within 3 Weeks from the Date thereof. At the same time that this Truce was proposed in Holland, there was also another put to the Dyet at Ratisbonne, import∣ing, in a manner, the same thing, and was accepted of by them; the more readily, to be sure, because of the War the Empire was now deeply engaged in with the Turks▪ In both which we find the Republick of Genoua mentioned, but for what Reason it is time we should here mention, it being the same as was transmitted from the place it self when the Occasion happen∣ed.Genoa bom∣barded by the French Fleet. The French Fleet arriving about the 17th of May before that City, the Fort on the Mole saluted them with 11 Guns, which was answered by the French Admiral with 9; when the Fort a little after saluted the Admiral again with 20 Cham∣bers and 10 Guns, which he returned with 7; so that they seemed yet to be in the dark what to think of it. Next Morn∣ing the Senate sent 6 Deputies on Board the Admiral to com∣plement him, and to know the occasion of the Fleet's coming thither (which they knew, no doubt, well enough before:) and being returned they reported to the Senate, that Monsieur Saignelay had told them, the King was very much dissatisfied with the late Conduct of the Republick, and that his Demands of them were: That they should quit the Protection of Spain; That they should join the 4 Gallies they had lately built with those of his Majesty; That they would permit the French to have a Magazine of Salt at Savona; That they should send 4 Senators on Board to beg his Majesty's Pardon, &c. The Se∣nate resolved not to grant these Demands, and therefore let the French know, if they drew not farther off, they would look upon them as Enemies: But they taking no notice of it, the Genoese, about 3 in the Afternoon, shot towards the Admiral
without Bullet, and an Hour after the several Forts fired with Shot, which made the French Ships and Gallies draw further off. But the  Galliots continued all in a Row to fire one part of the City, and began to throw their Bombs into the plate, which put the People into a very great Consternation, having never heard, and much less seen and felt such  thing before, (for, I think, this Action of the French was the first of Bombing any place by Sea before.) But it did not end here, and they themselves have since felt the dire Effects of it. On the 21th the Doge's Palace was quite beaten down, and the Doge and Senate removed to the Albergho, a great Fabrick built by the Publick, where the Bombs  not reach. The next Morning being the 22th, the French sent ashoar, to let the Senate know, That they were sorry to uine so fine a City; and that they would yet give them 24 Hours to agree to the King's Demands. Upon this the Great Council was called the 23th, early in the Morning, who resolved not to submit to the French Demands; and this Answer was given them at the Mole; the People now beginning to be couragious, and with a great Shout crying, Vive St. Georgio; whereupon the French began again to shoot their Bombs into the Town, and they from the Shoar fired upon the Fleet. The Inhabitants upon this occa∣sion removed most of their movable Effects into the neighbour∣ing Villages; and, to quiet the Rabble, there was leave given them to break open all the French men's Houses and Shops, which was soon done; but it had an ill Consequence; For the same Rabble began to rob and plunder what other Houses they pleased: Whereupon the Senate gave the Serjeant General of the City leave to hang up whomsoever he should find stealing; which, after some Examples made of them, brought all things quiet again. On the 23th at Sun-set the French Ships and Gallies came very near, and severely batter'd the Town for 7 Hours together, and in the mean time landed 500 Men to the Westward, and another Body on the East side of the City; but they were so warmly received, that they were forced at last to return to their Gallies, excepting several they left slain, and divers Prisoners behind them. But on the 24th the Sea grow∣ing high, the French Fleet weighed off, which the Genoese were not a little glad of; For, besides the vast Loss they suffered by this Bombardment already, they had dreadful Apprehensions of being entirely ruined; which made them bethink themselves of giving the King Satisfaction before such another Return; and therefore, at last, they were constrained, sore against their Wills, to send their Doge and 4 Senators to the French Court to make their humble Submissions. But while the French Monarch was thus triumphing over the little republick of Genoa, the Campaign was not in Hun∣gary; the general Rendesvouz of the Imperial Army, was up∣on
on the 20th of May at Schlesia upon the Waag, from whence they moved and Encamped the 30th. of the same Month near Sche∣nowitz, and from thence by several Marches and Halts, by Mon∣day the Fifth of June, they came within aif a Mile of Neuheusel▪ having, as 'twas thought, a design to Attack the place, but being informed on the 10th, that the Garrisons of Pest and Bu∣dae, consisted only of 8000 Men, and that there was no more Force besides there, save 2 or 3 Thousand Tartars that Encam∣ped near the place, and that even the whole Turkish Army be∣tween Buda and Esseck, consisted of no more than 17000 Men, and that there was not any Discourse of a greater Number; they ordered thereupon a Bridge of Boats to be made at Cran, which the Army marched over, and so joined General Mercy and Collonel Heusler, who had several Regiments of Horse un∣der their Command and some Foot; and the Duke on the 14th, after having sent 500 Men under Count Srum before, went directly to Vicegrade,Vicegrade besieged and taken by the Imperi∣alists. which was a Turkish Pass, and a strong Mountainous Fortress on the Danube, where his Artillery ar∣rived next Day; he ordered the place to be Attackt, at which the Enemy put out a Red Flag for a Signal of Defiance, having sent all their Women and Children before with the best of their Effects to Buda. However, the Infantry posted themselves immediately under the Walls of the Town, against whose Walls and Pallisadoes, they fired 12 pieces of Canon on the 16th all the day long, and in the Evening stormed it, which the Enemy not enduring, were forced to flee to the Castle and adjacent Mountains, but they found no security there neither: For the Castle was so Bombed next day, that about Noon they began to Capitulate; but it happened so, that the Conditions could not be agreed on that day, because of a flying Report that came from Gran, That Baron Halliwell had been worsted by the Enemy, which made the Duke with some Horse immediate∣ly move that way. But upon Confusion of Reports, he thought fit to send the Prince of Baden with some Squadrons thither, who, upon his Arrival, found the Action already over, which hapned briefly thus. The Turks upon their approach to Gra, about Noon appeared, and sounded an Allarm: Whereupon General Halliwel, who was much mistaken as to their Number, went and posted himself upon the left Hand, betwixt the two Mountains in a straight Pass, with about 500 Horse, and gave at the same time Orders to the Lieutenant Collonel of Sax Lau∣emburg, to advance through the Passage, and put himself in or∣der. Things being thus effected, the General from an Hill, where he had posted his Men, found, contrary to expectation, the Enemy much stronger than he had thought, drawn up in the form of an half Moon, and advancing with a design to in∣close him, which made him think of retiring, but it proved too late, for he was here killed, though Lieutenant Collonel Rab
did all he could to relieve him, falling upon the Enemy with great Fury, whom he drove back and pursued above 5 Miles from the Place, to an advantageous Post, where they ral∣lied, and in this Action came off with a greater Loss than the Christians. From Vicegrade the Duke of Lorain directed his March, by the Way of Gran and Barkan, towards Waisen, sending Colo∣nel Huster before, with 500 Horse, to view the Posture of the Enemy; who on Monday the 26th, brought Intelligence that the Turks were advancing towards Waisen, in the hollow Way: Whereupon the Duke continued his March, and next Day ar∣rived in the Plains of Waisen, where the Enemy being about 15000 strong, appeared, drawn up in Battallia. Their right Wing flanked with Janizaries stood upon the Mountain, but their left drew towards the City, which made the Duke put himself immediately into a Posture of Defence, flanking the Cavalry with the Infantry. This was hardly done, when the Enemy discharged 5 Pieces of Cannon they had, with great Fury several times upon the Imperialists right Wing, but with∣out any Damage, so that they quitted that Station, and fell briskly upon the left, but were soon beaten back in great Dis∣order and Confusion towards the right, where they were so warmly plied with the German Cannon, that they immediate∣ly retired; the Horse towards Pest, and as many of the Foot as saved themselves into the City, having lost in all about 1000, and among them one Basha, but with very little loss to the Germans; especially since the Duke of Lorain escaped so well, though so narrowly, for his Horse was shot through the Neck, during the Engagement. The Consequence of this Success, was (after the firing of some Cannon) the Surrender of Waisen upon Discretion: From hence the Army marched towards Pest, after having garrisoned the other Place with 2000 Foot, 500 Curassiers, and 300 Dragoons. On Monday the 10th of July, the whole Army got over the Danube, and encamped at a Place, called St. Andrew, their Left Wing being secured by the Danube, and their Right by an unaccessible Mountain, and right against them, a broad and long Marsh. But for all this, the Enemy not only advanced towards Noon, but divided themselves into 2 Wings, and leaving the great Marsh in the middle, fell with great Noise and Fury upon the Germans; whose Cavalry thereupon a little advanced upon their Left Wing, but were immediately ordered back, by the Duke's Commands: In the mean time, the Turks had beaten back the Christians Watch, but the Prince of Salm, who commanded the Rear-guard, stoutly opposed them, and being reinforced with a Battallion of Infantry, and with some Pieces of Cannon from the Duke, he utterly routed, and pursued them near upon 2 Miles; when the Turks rallied again, and fell with great Fu∣ry
upon the Right Wing; tho' a continued  from 20 Pieces of Cannon, which the Germans had planted, quickly drove them back to the Tops of the Mountains, where they thought to secure themselves: But  Bastemburg Battallion, who had be∣fore hid themselves in the Bushes of those Mountains, did so epper them with their Shot, that the foremost were con∣strained to quit them Saddles, and the hindermost to seek for shelter among the Bushes; from whence they were beaten down headlong by another Battallion into the Valley, where they were again extremly gauled by the Germans Cannon; and being forced to retire to their Right Wing, which by this time had put themselves into some Order, they fell with their whole Power upon the Christians Left, who bravely opposed them, and upon their retreat, were intercepted by Saffe∣berg's Regiment, and a Party of Dragoons, (who had posted themselves on the Right-hand of the Marsh) and divers of them slain. Upon this, they fled to a Mountain, where their Artillery was planted, and tarried there all Night, and next Day marched in all haste towards Buda; after a considerable Loss,The Siege of Buda. while the Imperialists in the mean time pitched their Camp within a Mile of the said City in a large Plain, and rested there till the 12th of the same Month, and on the 12th invested the Place. The Germans for the 3 following Days continued to rais Batteries, and make their Approaches, and on the 18th, the Camp was changed, part of the Infantry and Cavalry being detached over the Mountains, to besiege the Town on th side; when a strong Party of the Enemy appeared on the Emi∣nence towards Alba Regalis▪ which the Duke resolved to at∣tack; But they intended to assault the Germans▪ Approache while the Besieged made 4▪ furious Sallies, and beat the Ger∣mans on the Danube side, even to the Powder-Mill, but ther were at last every where repulsed, and drove into the City. The Imperialists the next Day attack'd the Lower Tow in 2 different places with that resolute Braver, that they e∣tirely carried it, and that with the Loss but of 10 Men, the Enemies amounting at least to 200; but the Place having, d∣ring the Assault, been fired both by the Turks and Christian though the Flame increased not much at first, yet a Wind a¦sing in the Night, it reduced it almost to Ashes. On the 20th, the Besiegers begun to raise a Battery on the Right hand of the Upper City, upon Gerrard's Mount, and toward Evening possest themselves of that Block-house, which th Turks had abandoned, and the Day following they continue their Battery with much Application, when at Night 'twas resolved the Duke of Lorain should go and see out the Enemy, who were Encamped about Four Mil of; concerning which, and the Victory that ensued, ta
the Account from the Duke's own LETTER to the Empror. IT having pleased Almighty God,The D. of Lorain's Letter to the Empe∣ror, concern∣ing the beat∣ing of the Turks Army. to give Your Imperial Majesty, Yesterday, being the Feast of St. Mary Magda∣len, a great and signal Victory, I could not omit sending this Express, Count Charles de Magni, Colonel of Dragoons, to give your Imperial Majesty an Account of it, with all the Circumstances that have accompanied this great Action: Upon the Advice we received on the 21st Instant, we were re∣solved to leave all the Infantry, and what Horse was neces∣sary, before Buda; and with the rest of the Cavalry, and 1000 Musqueteers, commanded by the Count de Aversburg; and 1500 Hussars▪ commanded by Count John Esterhasi, to go and meet the Enemy, who were encamped 2 German Miles beyond Buda, near Hanschabets. We marched all Night, and by Break of Day were within half a Mile of the Enemies Camp, who might easily see and observe us, being very well in∣trenched. They came out of their Camp, being about 20000 strong, put themselves into Battalia, and made a shew for some time of attacking us in our Flank, but we did our part to hinder their Design, and so the Fight begun; and God blessing your Majesty's Arms, we put the Enemy into Con∣fusion; they fled, and we followed them very close, and be∣came Masters of their whole Camp, (as at the Raising of the Siege of Vienna,) of all their Tents, Baggage, Artillery, and all their Riches: 4000 of the Turks were slain upon the Place, and a great many wounded, beside those that were killed, wounded, or taken Prisoners in the Pursuit, we having sent the Hungarians and the Poles after them. The Turks had with them 1000 Janizaries, who were all cut off. We have taken the great Standard of Mahomei, which the Sultn gives to the Grand Visier, when he takes upon him the general Command of the Army; and the Pavilion of the Turkish Of∣ficer, who is known by the Title of the Serasquier, and com∣manded in Chief this Army, in the Absence of the Grand Vifier. This Victory, through the Almighty Hand of God, may be said to be compleat and entire, and gives us a Pro∣spect of being in few Days Masters of the Town and Castle of Buda. Prince Lewis of Baden, Nephew to Prince Herman of Buden, pursued the Enemy above 2 Hours, at the Head of the Regiments of the Prince of Soy, and of General Goiz: And it was he that took the Enemies Cannon. The faith∣ful Hungarians and Prince  Poles followed them likewise a great way. We cannot sufficiently commend the Gourage of our Cavalry; and we may say to your Majesty, that all the Officers have behaved themselves extreamly well, and have out-done what could be expected from
them. We must truly own, that the Count de Caprara, Mareschal de Camp General, Prince Louis of Baden, the Prince de Salm, and all the Officers of the Imperial Army, have very much contributed to the Glory of this Day. We have caused Te Deum to be sung for this Victory: And for the rest, we refer it to Count Magni, to give your Imperial Majesty a more particular Account of what passed. CHARLES, Duke of Lorain. But, tho' this Success did considerably heighten the Courage of the Besiegers, yet it did at not all abate the Resolution of the Garrison to defend so important a Place to the last Extre∣mity; and therefore, tho' the former attacked it every way with all the Resolution imaginable, yet the other obstinately persisted to repulse them by frequent Sallies, and making new Intrenchments, and other Defences behind the Works that were ruined by the Imperialists Cannon. And this continued for the Remainder of July, the whole Month of Aug. and to the 11th of Sept. when the Duke of Bavaria, with his Auxili∣ary Forces, arrived in the Camp; who taking up their Post on the Left-hand of the Bridge, immediately raised a Battery against the Castle; and the Elector, on the 13th, sent a Cor∣poral of his, who understood the Turkish Language, with a Summons in Turkish and in Latin, in his Imperial Majesty's Name, to surrender the Town; giving him a Captive Turk for a Guide. The Basha ordered the Messenger 15 Ducats and told him, That he had no need to give up the Town being provided with all Things necessary for its Defence Whereupon, the Bavarians fell furiously on, and advanced the Siege very much on their side; but the Germans succeeded not so well. And this continued for several Days, when, on Mon∣day the 25th of Sept. the Enemy made a more vigorous Sall than they had done at any time before, while the Serasquie who had a good Army without, used all his Endeavours at the same time to put some Troops into the City, over the Hill, on the Left of Weissemberg; and, notwithstanding the great Ef∣forts made by the Christians to repulse them, they succeeded so well as to get 600 Men into the Place. Now the Siege be∣gan to be fainter and fainter; and the Besieged appeared eve∣ry Day more vigorous than other: And so Things continued almost for a Month longer, when the Garrison made 3 great Sallies on the 24th and 25th of Oct. with so much Resolution, that they killed abundance of the Christians, and ruined seve∣ral of their Works; the Bavarians were forced to abandon their Mines, as being filled with Water; and the chief Mines of the
Imperialists being discovered by the Turks, they were render'd useless; These Considerations, and a great Army of the Infidels being by this time got together, under the Serasquier, oc∣casioned the sending of the Marquess Herman of Baden into the Camp; where, after several Conferences, it was concluded, that by reason of the bad Weather, and the Cavalry wanting Forage for a long time together, they should raise the Siege, and march off; thinking that more adviseable, than to ruin the whole Ar∣my. And therefore,The Siege of Buda raised. on Oct. 29, the Artillery was drawn off, and shipped; and two Days after the whole Army marched a∣way in good Order. But somewhat to sweeten the great Loss and Disapointment of the Germans in the Siege of Buda, their Arms proved much more successful in other Parts during this Campaign: And first, in Sclavonia; where Count Lesley having laid Siege to Vi∣tovitza, the chief City of that Country, on the 11th of July, and carried on the same with great Conduct till towards the 20th, he then understood that the Turks, after having drawn together all the Forces they could between the Save and the Drave, in order to succour the Place, were arrived, under the Command of the Basha of Maratha, who had the Guard of the Bridge of Esseck, near Flatina, about 4 German Miles from Vi∣rovitza, making in all 2500 Men; but were to join the Beg of Zerneg and the Governor of Grandischa, who for that purpose were, with 1400 more, on their March towards him: Where∣upon the Count immediately commanded the Regiments of Croats, making about 4000 Men, to march under the Com∣mand of the Count de Trantmarsdorse, with Orders to pre∣vent the Enemy's Conjunction; who therefore marched all Night, and about 7 in the Morning attacked the said Basha in his Camp near Flatina,Count Lesley routs the Turks in Selavonia, and takes Virovitz. whom they routed, and pursued, with considerable Slaughter, as far as Turbinat. In returning from hence, they happily met with the other Party, commanded by the Beg, who knew nothing of the other's Defeat, yet they made a very weak Resistance, but many of them saved them∣selves in the adjacent Woods. This Expedition being thus happily over, the Count returned with 12 Standards, and 20 of the most considerable Prisoners, into the Camp, besides all the Provisions he took, which they had designed for the Relief of that Place. In pursuance of this Defeat, the Garrison of Virovitza capitulated; and on the 25th the Germans took pos∣session of the Place. But Count Lesley was like to have paid very dear for this Conquest and Victory; for while he was en∣camped at the Bridge of Turannovitz, on the Drave, the Se∣rasquier, being reinforced with several Troops from Bosnia, de∣camped from Walpon with an Army of about 30000 Men, and thought to have overpower'd him: Yet the Count having time∣ly Notice of his Design, he posted his Troops (which did not
make above 14000 in all▪ advantagiously between two Moras∣ses, and fortified his Camp, and there received the Turks with such Warmth and Vigour, that he repulsed them with Loss, but did not think fit to pursue them, he esteeming it enough to have made good his Post, which, upon further Informations of the Enemy's Motion, he fortified yet more advantagiously; and towards the latter end of Sept. he went to Vienna, to give the Emperor an Account more particularly of his Affairs on that side. But▪ Sclavonia was not the only Country where the Empe∣ror's Arms succeeded this Summer,The Empe∣ror's Forces successful a∣gainst the Turks in Vpper Hun∣gary. Vpper Hungary had a Share therein, where General Schultz commanded; and who, about the beginning of Sept. having received Advice that Count Tekeley had put 150 Men and 2 Pieces of Cannon into a small Place, called Zeben, he decamped from Tarza, and attacked the Place so seasonably, that he carried it by Assault, having put the Hungarian and German Deserters that he found therein to the Sword. From thence he sent several Spies to Count Tekeley's Army, by whom being informed of the Number of his Troops, and the Situation of his Camp, he resolved to attack him; and accordingly, leaving his Baggage at Zeben he marched on the 17th in the Evening, with all his Cavalry, and part of his Foot which the Horse-men carried behind them; and being come a∣bout 3 in the Morning near the Enemy's Camp, he drew his Troops into Battalia, and fell upon them before they had time to put themselves in a Posture of Defence; So that all they could do, in the Confusion they were in, was, to think of making their Escape, some one way, some another; insomuch that in less than an Hour's space he became Master of their Camp and Artillery, consisting of 5 Pieces of Cannon, and of all their Ammunition, Tents and Baggage, and even of Tekeley's Coach and Standard, who himself had much ado to escape, for he was in Bed, and had hardly time to put on his Cloaths, and had but 2 or 3 Persons to accompany him in his Flight. But what was perhaps of worse Consequence to count Teckeley, was, that in his Tent were not only found his Sable, Wearing Appa∣rel, Plate and Money, but even his Papers also: To which, if you add the Loss of 4000 Men slain in this Action, it may be reckoned as intire a Defeat as any that hath happened in the whole Course of the War. Upon this, General Schltz▪ im∣mediately laid Siege to Esperies; but finding a great Garrison in it, and well provided, he quitted it, and contented himself to take in first a Place called Barthseldt, four Miles from the former, and a large Town upon the Frontiers of Poland, and then some other smaller Places, and so retired to Winter-Quar∣ters.
Having now traced through this Years War in Hungary,The Cam∣paign in Po∣land. be∣tween the Turks and Germans, we are next to see what has been done on the Polish side, before we enter upon the Affairs of the Venetians, whose first Campaign it has been, to make up the tripple Confederacy. It was in the middle of Aug. before the King of Poland joined the Army, at a Place called, Buck∣sacs, from whence he sent Detachments to attack the Fortress of Jaslowick, which after a little Contention, was surrendred to him. It was expected after this, that his Majesty would either have besieged Caminiec, or march into Moldavia or Wal∣lachia, but neither of the two happened; For, as to the first, he contented himself to pretend at first to block it up, and then to throw a few Bombs into it. And as for the other, he was so far from advancing into the Enemies Country, that the Turks and Tartars believing he was engaged in the Siege of the said Place, marched to the Relief of it. This, when the King was informed of, he marched to Kolenzan; but then it appear∣ing, that there was no more than a Detachment of the Tar∣tars come over the Niester, to observe the Polish Army, he or∣dered his Van-guard to charge them; which they did with that Bravery and Eagerness, that the Enemy immediately fled, leaving a great many slain behind them, some computing 3000; while the Poles, on their side, lost about 100. And with this ended the Campaign in that Part of the World, without any Thing that was Memorable, or worth Record∣ing. Now we shall look a little into the Proceedings of the Re∣publick of Venice, upon this present Conjuncture. After they had perfected their Alliance with the Emperor, and the King of Poland, in the Spring of the Year, they gave the chief Command of their Forces to the Procurator Morosini, who had formerly done them signal Service in the War of Candia, with the Title of Captain-General; who, about the Month of June, did rendesvouz with the Fleet at Lessina, and from thence sailed towards Corfu; where having staid some time, he put to Sea again, July 19, and next Day arrived before Sancta Maura, which is a Portress situated at the Mouth of the Gulf of Pre∣vesa, on a little Neck of Land, being very strong, and was then very well fortified, having the Sea on one side, and a great Morals on the other. However, the light Vessels enter'd the Port of Damata, on the 21st, and the Forces landed on each side of the Place at the same time; which being done, the Captain-General sent the Governour a Summons to surrender, threatning upon his Refusal, to put all the Garrison to the Sword. The other answered, That the Fortress belonged to the Grand Signior, who had given him Charge of it; and that therefore, according to this Duty, he would defend it to the last. But he deserted the Suburbs on the East at the same time. On the 23d, the Fleet began to batter the Place, but with no great Success, because of the high Wind; yet, next
Day the whole Fleet was so disposed, as to do most Execution with their Cannon; and the Galleasses were advanced within Musquet-shot of the Fortress, and they threw in a great many Bombs and Fire-balls, with good Success, tho' they themselves received some Damage from the Guns of the Enemy. Nei∣ther were the Forces that landed idle on their part, for by the 25th they had finished a Battery of 20 Pieces of Cannon, and the next Day another somewhat nearer, but both on the East∣side of the Town; as they raised one also to the Westward the Days following, wherewith they made a Breach in the Wall; wherein, however, they were disturbed in a Sally by the Turks, who were quickly beaten back, but yet so, as that they took care to defend themselves within; For, by the 1st of Aug. they filled up the Breach with Sacks of Straw, and Bales of Wool, which, yet the Christians ruined with their Cannon, and advanced their Trenches to the Counterscarp; and on the 2d thought to have advanced farther, when they found the Breach again filled up. This made them descend into the Ditch, a third part whereof was filled on the 3d at Night with Fag∣gots; and in the Morning they made 2 Descents more into the Ditch, their Cannon having not only made a large Breach, but dismounted all the Cannon in the Place, which greatly in∣commoded the Besieged,The Veneti∣ans take Sancta Mau∣ra. who were excluded from all Relief every way, since the Sieur Manata had been posted with 600 Men on the side of Prevesa, to shut them up that way also: Wherefore, finding the Ditch quite filled up, and receiving another severe Summons, they sent out 3 Deputies on the 7th; who being brought to the General, cast themselves on the Ground, praying he would grant them a Capitulation; which be did, so far as to allow them to march out with Arms, and what they could carry about them, to the Number of 600, and were convoyed to Prevesa. And thus the Venetians be∣came Masters of Sancta Maura, wherein they found 80 Pieces of Brass Cannon, 20 whereof had the Arms of St. Mark upon them, and a great Quantity of Ammunition and Provisions. But this Conquest was not gained without the Loss of near 500 Men. The Captain-General continued some Time at this Place,The Veneti∣ans make ncursions into the Tur∣kish Terri∣tories. to give the necessary Orders for the Repairing its Fortificati∣ons, and the Security of the Island, and then sailed away along the Coast; and having caused his Troops to make a Descent a Dragomastra, they were soon joined by 2500 Greeks, who had taken up Arms, and so marched above 50 Miles into the Country, burnt two great Towns, called Dragosi, and Zapan∣di, with a great many Villages, and ruined the whole Country of Acarnania; but gave Protection to several Greek Boroughs and Villages that desired it, and promised an Annual Pension, This Progress of theirs, the Sangiac of the Province endea∣voured
to oppose, and to that end, drew all the Force he could together, and attacked them, but to no Purpose, for they en∣tirely defeated him; and the Greeks that had joined them gave a particular Testimony of their Fidelity to the State, upon this Occasion. And that every Thing might contribute to the facilitating of this Incursion, the Captain-General had ordered the Gallies to post themselves before Perasto, and the Castle of Lepanto, to keep in those Garrisons, that they might not disturb them. The Forces being re-imbark'd with a vast Booty,The Veneti∣ans besiege Prevesa. the Cap∣tain-General steered his Course towards Prevesa, with a Re∣solution to attack it, it being of great Importance, for the Se∣curing of the Conquest of Sancta Maura, because it is situated at the Entrance of the Gulph of Arta, which it commands; where he was no sooner arrived, but he ordered 5 Gallies and 6 Galleasses, to approach towards the Castles, called Geme∣nizze, which are almost in sight of Prevesa, with a Design to amuse the Enemy, and to oblige them to divide their Troops, by sending Reinforcements thither, which had the Success the General proposed to himself therein: For, Saban Basha belie∣ving the Venetians would attack those Castles, sent thither the greatest part of the Troops he had drawn together for the Security of Prevesa. Whereupon the whole Fleet, Sept. 20, sailed from Damata, reached that Evening to the Gulph's Mouth, and next Morning Capt. Manetta, with 24 Barks, and several armed Brigantines entered the Gulph, and landed part of the Troops safely, in spight of all the Firing of the Turks, with their great and small Shot upon them, when the Gallies advanced at the same time within Musquet shot of the Place, to make a Diversion, and to facilitate the Disembarking of the Troops, which having advanced by Land, passed in Galliots, an Arm of the Sea, about half a Mile abroad, under the Com∣mand of General Strasoldo; while the Turks believing they designed to Land their Troops at the Place where the Gallies had posted themselves, imployed their chief Care on that side to hinder it: But finding their Mistake, they sent 500 Spahi's in great haste to charge the Venetian Troops that passed the Arm of the Sea above-mentioned, but this was too late; for those Troops were already drawn up in order of Battel, and recei∣ved the Turks so well that many of them were killed, and the rest fled in so much Disorder, that the greatest part of them could not get into the Town. This gave the Christians an Opportunity not only to advance, but to possess themselves of an Hill near the Place; And this was succeeded with a Sum∣mons from the General to surrender: But the Governour, Saban Basha, who was gone to put himself at the Head of a Body of Turks, to observe the Motion of the Christians, as not believing they durst undertake the Siege of Prevesa; The Of∣ficer
that commanded in his Absence, would not receive the General's Letter, but rudely fired upon the Person that car∣ried it. Thereupon they landed 4. Pieces of Cannon, and as many Mortars on the 22d, and next Day shot above 300 Bombs into the Town, which burnt several Houses, and before Night dismounted all the Enemies Cannon but one, and had all this while but one Man killed, and few wounded. On the 24th, they made a Lodgment in the Ditch, and began to Mine un∣der the Great Tower of the Place, towards the Terra Firma, but they were somewhat disturbed by a Sally of the Turks, who yet had no great Success: So that the Besiegers the 3 fol∣lowing Days advanced their Works, notwithstanding the Ene∣my plyed them very warmly with their small Shot, so far that the Mine being ready by the 28th, and a considerable▪ Breach made by the Cannon, Orders were given for a general Assault. But next Morning the Turks prevented them, by hanging out a White Flag, and sending 5 Deputies to capitulate, who re∣quired the same Conditions as had been granted to Sancta Maura; But the General would allow them no other, save that 30 of the most considerable of the Garrison,Prvesa sur∣rendered. should march out with their Arms and Baggage, and the rest without Arms, taking only along with them what they could carry, which the Turks were forced to submit to. And so they marched out of the Place on the 30th of Sept. leaving 44 Pieces of Cannon, 14 whereof were large, and would shoot a 50 Pound Ball, with a considerable Quantity of Ammunition and Provisions, to the Conquering Venetians, who after this went to Winter at Coru. But their Troops in Dalmatia did not yet do so; they and the Morlaques, under the Dominion of the Republick, had all along the War, been very successful▪ not only in several Ren∣counters with the Turks, but in divers Incursions into their Country, from whence they always returned with good Booty, besides possessing themselves of some Places in those Parts. But my Design will not admit me to descend to such Minute Parti∣culars; and therefore, I shall only observe, that before the Expiration of this Year, they took in the Isle of Narenta, and the Castle of Narini: And were thereupon joined by a great many of the Neighbouring Greeks. But the advanced Season confined them now to their Winter Quarters, as I am also confined to close up the History of this Year, without super∣adding any remarkable Adventure, as I have hitherto been ted to do.
There is nothing occurs, worthy of Consideration this Year, before the Death of Charles II. King of England, who was seized,The Death of King Charles II. as they gave out, of a violent Fit of an Apoplexy, on Monday the 2d of Feb. and on the 7th departed this Life, in the 37th Year of his Reign, computing it from his Father's Death, after he had lived 54 Years, 8 Months, and 8 Days. His Character I will not attempt, it has been done so well al∣ready by a Learned Pen: But, for his Religion, if we believe his Brother that succeeded him, he was (however otherwise he appeared outwardly) in his Life, Heart and Soul, a true Roman Catholick, not only by his Dying in the Communion of the Church of Rome, and other Ceremonies of that Church; But the Papers taken out of his Strong Box, and which his Brother took Care to Publish to the World, plainly proved him to be so in his Judgment. However, be this as it will, he had little Regard to any▪ Thing that favoured of Sincere Religion; for he would occasionally in his ordinary Conversa∣tion ridicule most Opinions, and that Religion most of all, wherein it was said he died. I know not whether it be to his Praise to say, He was a Prince the most fit to Govern of any other, and applied himself the least to it, which was great pitty, since he had such an Insight into Men and Things, that no Monarch of his Age could pretend to compare with him▪ besides a mild Disposition, which made him at his Death be so universally lamented by all sorts of his Protestant Subjects, but more by those that dissented from the Publick Church, out of the Fear they had of the Religion, and Temper of his Successor, than any real Kindness for his Government, which of latter Years especially, had not been very mild towards them. But for my part, I think a witty Quaker made a truer Judg∣ment of that Conjuncture than any other, for appearing very merry and jovial, when all about him discovered all the Marks of Sorrow imaginable for the King's Death, and being asked the Reason of it; he replied, He had no Occasion to grieve, but the Contrary; for, that having two to deal withal before,  God be thanked, there was but one. And now James,K. James  Speech to the Council∣  Duke of York, ascends the English , and having the same Day of his Brother's Death, assembled the Council, he declared to them, That since it had pleased God to place him in that Station, to succeed so good and gracious a King, as well as so kind a Brother, he thought  to Declare his Endeavours, to follow his Brother's Example, more especi∣ally in that of his great Clemency and Tenderness to his Peo∣ple; and make it his Business, to preserve the Government both in Church and State, as by Law established: Commend∣ed the Church of England's Principles and Members, and said, He knew the Laws of England were sufficient to make the King
as great a Monarch, as he could wish; and therefore, as he would never depart from the just Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, so he would never invade any Man's Property. It was well enough spoke of him, and as well acted, that he did not dissemble his Religion, which was Popish; and for which some in his Brother's Reign were severely used, for but saying he was so; for the very next Sunday after his Brother's Death, he went publickly to Mass: But his taking the Customs and Excise, granted only for the Life of his Brother, before they were given him by Parliament, did ill Correspond with that part of his Speech, that he would never invade any Man's Property; and as little did the severe and barbarous Usage of Dr. Oates, (whom they endeavoured to prove Guilty of Per∣jury, tho' the Contrary has since manifestly appeared by Ben. Hinton's Books) agree with his saying, He would imitate his Brother in his Clemency and Tenderness to his People. But to leave these Things pass. His Majesty being solemnly Crowned the 23d of April,K. James II Crownd, and his Speech to the Parlia∣ment. at Westminster, he appointed a Parliament to meet the 22d of May, to whom after having repeated much the same Things, as he had told the Council before, he proceeded to tell them▪ That after having given them such Assurances, he could not doubt but of a suitable return on their part, and particularly in what related to the settling of his Revenues, as he called it, as it was in his Brother's time; That he might use many Arguments to them for enforcing his Demand from the benefit of Trade, supply of the Navy, the necessity of the Crown, and the well∣being of the Government it self, which he was not to suffer to be precarious; That he foresaw there was one popular Argu∣ment which might be used against what he asked, from the inclination Men had for frequent Parliaments, which some might think would be best secured by feeding him from time to time, by such proportions, as they should think convenient; But that Argument, it being the first time he spake to them from the Throne, he would answer once for all, that that would be a very improper Method to take with him, that the best way to ingage him to meet them often, was to use him always well, and therefore he expected a speedy Compliance with his Demands now, that he might meet them again to all their Sa∣tisfactions. But tho this was a very odd way of caressing a Parliament,The Parlia∣ment gives him a great deal of Mo∣ney. yet they being in a manner fashioned before to his hand, they were so far from taking notice of it, and what was more, of the most grievous and dangerous State of the whole Nation, as it was left by King Charles, that instead of representing the same to the now King, or redressing any Grievance, they immediate∣ly gave him a Revenue to enable him to ruin the Church and State upon the Foundation his Brother had laid for him; for
besides their settling the Customs and Temporary Excise upon him, as they were before upon his Brother; They laid a new Imposition upon Wines and Vinegars, made an Act to lay more Custom upon Sugars and Tobacco; another laying an Impositi∣on upon all French Linnens, and all East-India Linnen, and se∣veral other Indian Manufactures; also upon French Wrought Silks and Stuffs, and all Brandies: And that there might be a nearer Conjunction between His Majesty and France, (tho the Nation thought them always before too great) the Act for pro∣hibiting the Importation of French Wine, Vinegar, Brandy, Linnens, and Cloth, Silks, Malt, Paper, or any Manufacture made or mix'd with Silk, Thread, Wool, Hair, Gold or Sil∣ver, or Leather, being of the Growth or Manufacture of France, was now fully repealed. There was also five Shillings per Tun granted upon every Voyage, which any foreign Ship should make from Port to Port in England, and Twelve-pence per Tun, for every Voyage which a Foreign built Ship, not free, should make; so that in short, this Revenue with the Hereditary Excise, and other Revenues of the Crown, have been computed to amount to 2400000 l. per Annum, to which, if you add 15000 per Annum, which the King had when he was Duke of York, the whole will amount to 2550000 per An. which was 3 times more than any King of England (except Henry VIII.) had before the King's Brother. But before this Sessions was over, they heard of something, not only from the North, but also from the West, that did not a little terri∣fie the greatest part of them. The King in the Close of the fore-mentioned Speech, the very Day of the Opening of the Parliament, told them, That he had News that Morning from Scotland, that the Earl of Argyle was Landed in the West Highlands with the Men that he had brought along with him from Holland, and that there were Two Declarations Published, one in the Name of all those in Arms there, and the other in his own: He said in ge∣neral of both, that he was charged in them of Usurpation and Tyranny, but gave no Particulars of the Former, the Court contenting themselves to put it by piece-meals into the Gaz∣zette, with what Animadversions they pleased; but the last of them he presently communicated unto them, and was in Sub∣stance this that follows:
A DECLARATION of Archibald, Earl of Argyle, Lord Kintyre, Cowall, Campbell and Lorn, Heritable Sheriff, and Lieutenant of the Shires of Argyle and Turbette, and Heritable Justice Ge∣neral of the said Shires. I Shall not Publish my Case Published already in Print,The Earl of Argyle's De∣claration. in Latin and in Dutch, and more largely in English, nor mean I to repeat the Printed Declaration emitted by several Noble Men, Gentlemen and others of both Nations now in Arms, because the Sufferings of Me▪ and my Family, are therein mentioned. I have thought it fit for me to Declare for my Self, that as I go to Arms with those who have appointed me to Conduct them, for no Private and Personal End, only for those contained in the said Declaration, which I have concert∣ed with them and approved of; so I do claim no Interest, but what I had before the pretended Forfeiture of my Family, and have a sufficient Right to. And that I do freely (and as a Christian) forgive all Perso∣nal Injuries against my Person and Family, to all that shall not oppose, but joyn and concur with us in our present Underta∣king, for the Ends mentioned in the said Declaration▪ and hereby I oblige my self never to pursue them in Judgment, nor out of Judgment. And I do further declare, That ob∣taining the Quiet and peaceable Possession of what belonged to my Father and my Self, before our pretended Forfeitures▪ I shall satisfie all Debts due by my Father and my Self, as any Heir or Debtor can be obliged. And as my Faithfulness to his late Majesty, and his Govern∣ment hath sufficiently appeared to all unbyassed Persons, void of Malice, so I do with Grief acknowledge my former, too much complying with, and conniving at the Methods that have been taken to bring us to the sad Condition we are now in, though God knows never concurring in the De∣sign. I have now with God's Strength suffered patiently my un∣just Sentence and Banishment 3 Years an half, and have ne∣ver offered to make any Uproar or Defence by Arms, to disturb the Peace upon my private Concern; but the King being now dead, and the Duke of York having taken off his Mask, and abandoned and invaded our Religion and Liber∣ties, resolving to enter into the Government, and exerci∣sing it contrary to Law, I think it not only just, but my Duty to God and my Country, to use my utmost En∣deavours,
to oppose and repress his Usurpations and Ty∣ranny. And therefore being assisted and furnish'd very nobly by several good Protestants▪ and invited and accompanied by se∣veral of both Nations to lead them, I resolve, as God shall enable me, to use their Assistance of all kinds, towards the Ends exprest in the said Declaration. And I do hereby earnestly Invite and Obtest all honest Protestants, and particularly all my Friends, and Blood Rela∣tions, to concur with us in the said Declaration; And as I have written several Letters, so having no other way fully to in∣timate my Mind otherwise, I do hereby require all my Vas∣sals any where, and all within my several Jurisdictions, with their fensible Men within their Command, to go to Arms, and to join and concur with us according to the said Declaration, as they shall be answerable at their Peril; and that they obey the particular Orders they shall receive from me, from time to time. I need not tell the World the Fate of this brave Man▪Argyle ta∣ken and be∣headed. it was generally believed at that time, that Sir John Cockram, who came over with him, betrayed him; as some Body else was thought to have done by the Duke of Monmouth; but how∣ever that Matter was in Reality, Thus it happened with the Earl, that after several Marches and Countermarches, his Men were at length lead into a Boggy sort of a Place, on Pretence, or with Intention to bring him off from the King's Army, then upon the Heels of them, where they all lost one another, dis∣persed and shifted for themselves: The Earl himself being ta∣ken by a Country Man, and brought to Edenburgh; he there suffered for his former unpardonable Crime, in requiring Care should be taken for the Protestant Religion, and the Explaining the Test conformable thereunto, for the Legality of which he had the Hands of most of the Eminent Lawyers about the Ci∣ty. He made a very pious End, being beheaded at Edenburgh, June 30. But this Business of Argyle was but like Thunder afar off,K. James his Practices against the Duke of Monmouth. to what happened, soon after in the West of England; K. James was so apprehensive, not only before, but even after his As∣cension to the Throne, of the Duke of Monmouth's Designs a∣gainst him, that he used his utmost Endeavours by his Envoy Mr. Skelton, in Holland, to get him secured and sent into Eng∣land; which Design could not yet he carried so covertly, but that the Prince of Orange came to the Knowledge of it; who having more Honour and Goodness in him, than to suffer an innocent forelorn Man, to fall into the Hands of those who had been the Occasion of his Exile, and Misery, did not only give the Duke Notice of the Plot against him, but gave him
Money to go privately to Brussels, with a farther Assurance, that if he would go to the Campaign in Hungary, he would maintain him at his own Charge, with an Equipage suitable to his Quality: But his Fate led him to return again privately from thence, into Holland; where having concerted his Mea∣sures with such Refugiated English as he found there, they em∣barked on 3 small Vessels,D. of Mon∣mouth lands in England. and about June 12, lan ded at Lyme in Dorsetshire, where the Duke, in his own, and the rest of his Followers Names, put out his Declaration; which, because the State, at that time, were so far from thinking fit to publish, as they were Argyle's, that they made it Criminal to read it, and used all their Endeavours to smother it, we shall here give you Word for Word. The DECLARATION of James, Duke of Mon∣mouth, and the Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, now in Arms for the Defence and Vindication of the Protestant Religion, and the Laws, Rights and Priviledges of ENGLAND. AS Government was originally instituted by God,His Decla∣ration. and this or that Form of it chosen and submitted to by Men, for the Peace, Happiness and Security of the Governed, and not for the private Interest, and personal Greatness of those that rule; So that Government hath always been esteemed the best, where the Supream Magistrates have been invested with all the Power and Prerogatives that might capacitate them, not only to preserve the People from Violence and Oppression, but to promote their Prosperity; and yet, where nothing was to be∣long to them by the Rules of the Constitution, that might en∣able them to injure and oppress them. And it hath been the Glory of England, above most other Nations, that the Prince had all intrusted with him that was necessary, either for the advancing the Welfare of the People, or for his own Protection in the Discharge of his Office; and withal stood so limited and restrained by the Fundamental Terms of the Constitution, that without a Violation of his own Oath, as well as the Rules and Measures of the Government, he could do them no hurt, or exercise any Act of Authority, but through the Administra∣tion of such Hands as stood obnoxious to be punished in case they transgressed: So that according to the primitive Frame of the Government, the Prerogatives of the Crown and the Privileges of the Subject are so far from justling one another, that the Rights reserved unto the People tended to render the King Honourable and Great; and the Prerogatives settled on
the Prince were in order to the Subjects Protection▪ and Safe∣ty. But all Humane Things being subject to Perversion, as well as Decay, it hath been the Fate of the English Govern∣ment to be often changed, and wrested from what it was in the first Settlement and Institution. And we are particularly compelled to say, that all the Boundaries of the Government have of late been broken, and nothing left unattempted for turning our limited Monarchy into an absolute Tyranny: For such hath been the Transaction of Affairs within this Nation for several Years last past, that though the Protestant Reli∣gion and Liberties of the People were fenced and hedged a∣bout by as many Laws as the Wisdom of Man could devise for their Preservation against Popery and Arbitrary Power, our Religion hath been all along countermined by Popish Counsels, and our Privileges ravished from us by Fraud and Violence. And more especially, the whole Course and Series of the Life of the D. of Y. hath been but one continued Conspiracy a∣gainst the Reformed Religion, and the Rights of the Nation: For, whoever considers his contriving the burning of London, his instigating a Confederacy with France, and a War with Holland, his fomenting the Popish Plot, and encouraging the Murther of Sir Ed. Godfrey to stifle it; his charging Treason against Protestants, suborning Witnesses to swear the Patriots of our Religion and Liberties out of their Lives; his hiring execrable Villains to assassinate the late Earl of Essex, and cau∣sing those others to be clandestinely cut off, in hopes to conceal it; his advising and procuring the Prorogation and Dissoluti∣on of Parliaments, in order to prevent their looking into his Crimes, and that he might escape the Justice of the Nation; Such can imagine nothing so black and horrid in it self, or so ruinous and destructive to Religion and the Kingdom, which we may not expect from him. The very Tyrannies which he hath exercised since he snatch∣ed the Crown from his Brother's Head, do leave none under a Possibility of flattering themselves with Hopes of Safety▪ eithor in their Consciencies, Persons, or Estates; For, in defiance of all the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, made for the Securi∣ty of the Reformed Protestant Religion, he not only began his Reign with a bare-faced▪ A vowing himself of the Romish Religion, but call'd in Multitudes of Priests and Jesits, for whom the Law makes it Treason to come into this Kingdom; and hath impower'd them to exercise Idolatries: And besides his being daily present at the Worship of the Mass, he hath publickly assisted at the greatest opperies of their Supersti∣tion. Neither hath he been more tender in trampling upon the Laws which concern our Properties, seeing in two Procla∣mations, whereof the one requires the Collecting of the Cu∣stoms, and the other the continuing that part of the Excise
which was to expire at the late King's Death; he hath vio∣lently, and against all the Law of the Land, broken in upon our Estates. Neither is it any xtenuation of his Tyranny, that he is countenanced in it by an Extrajudicial Opinion of seven or eight suborned and forsworn Judges; but rather de∣claring the Greatness and Extent of the Conspiracy against our Rights; and that there is no Means left for our Relief, but by Force of Arms: For, advancing those to the Bench, that were the Scandal of the Bar; and constituting those very Men to de∣clare the Laws, who were accused and branded in Parliament for perverting them, we are precluded all Hopes of Justice in Westminster-Hall: And by packing Juries together by false Re∣turns, new illegal Charters, and other corrupt Means, he doth at once deprive us of all Expectations of Succour where our An∣cestors were wont to find it; and hopes to render that which ought to be the People's Fences against Tyranny, and the Conservator of their Liberties, the Means of subverting all our Laws, and of establishing of his Arbitrariness, and con∣firming our Thraldom. So that unless we could be contented to see the Reformed Protestant Religion and such as profess it extirpated, Popish Superstition and Idolatry established, the Laws of the Land trampled under foot, the Liberties and Rights of the English People subverted, and all that is Sacred and Civil, or of Regard amongst Men of Vertue or Piety, violated; and unless we could be willing to be Slaves as well as Papists, and forget the Example of our noble and generous Ancestors, who convey'd our Privileges to us at the Expence of their Blood and Treasure; and withal, be unmindful of our Duty to GOD, our Country, and Posterity; deaf to the Cries and Groans of our oppressed Friends, and be satisfied, not only to see them and our selves imprisoned, robbed and murthered, but the Protestant Interest throughout the whole World betrayed to France and Rome; We are bound, as Men, and Christians, and that in Discharge of our Duty to GOD and our Country, and for the Satisfaction of the Protestant Nations round about us, to betake our selves to Arms▪ which, we take Heaven and Eearth to witness, we should not have done, had not the Malice of our Enemies deprived us of all other Means of Redress; and were not the Miseries that we already feel, and those which do further threaten us, worse than the Calamities of War. And it is not for any personall Injuries, or private Discontents, nor in pursuance of any cor∣rupt Interest, that we take our Swords in our Hands; but for vindicating our Religion, Laws and Rights, and rescuing our Country from Ruin and Destruction, and for the preserving our selves, Wives and Children from Bondage and Idolatry. Wherefore, before GOD, Angels and Men, we stand acquit∣ted from, and do charge upon our Enemies, all the Slaugh∣ter
and Devastations that unavoidably accompany Intestine War. Now, therefore we do hereby solemnly declare and proclaim War against J. D. of Y. as a Murtherer, and an Assassmator of innocent Men, a Traytor to the Nation, and a Tyrant over the People. And we would have none that appear under his Banner to flatter themselves with Expectation of Forgiveness, it being our firm Resolution to prosecute him and his Adhe∣rents, without giving way to Treaties and Accommodations, until we have brought him and them to undergo what the Rules of the Constitution, and the Statutes of the Realm, as well as the Laws of Nature, Scripture and Nations, adjudge to be Punishment due to the Enemies of GOD, Mankind, their Country, and all things that are honourable, vertuous and good. And though we cannot avoid being sensible that too many have, from Cowardise, Covetousness and Ambition, co-ope∣rated to the subverting of our Religion, and enslaving their Country; yet we would have none, from a Despair of finding Mercy, persevere in their Crimes, no continue the Ruin of the Kingdom: For we exclude none from the Benefit of Repen∣tance, that will join with us in retrieving that they have been accessary to the Loss of: Nor do we design Revenge upon any, but the Obstinate, and such as shall be found at this Juncture yielding Aid and Assistance to the said J. D. of Y. And that we may both govern our selves in the Pursuit of this glorious Cause wherein we are engaged, and give Encou∣ragement to all that shall assist us in so righteous and necessary an Undertaking, we do, in the Presence of the LORD, who knoweth the Secrets of all Hearts, and is the Avenger of De∣ceit and Falshood, proclaim and publish what we aim at; and for the obtaining whereof, we have both determined to ven∣ture, and are ready to lay down our Lives. And though we are not come, into the Field to introduce Anarchy and Confu∣sion, or for laying aside any part of the old English Govern∣ment, yet our Purposes and Resolutions are, to reduce Things to that Temperament and Ballance, that future Rulers may re∣main able to do all the Good that can be either desired or ex∣pected from them; and that it may not be in their Power to invade the Rights, and infringe the Liberties of the People. And whereas our Religion, the most valuable thing we lay claim unto, hath been shaken by unjust Laws, undermined by Popish Counsels, and is now in danger to be subverted; we are therefore resolyed to spend our Blood for preserving it to our selves and osterity: Nor will we lay down our Arms▪ till we see it established and secured beyond all probability of be∣ing supplanted and overthrown, and until all the Penal Laws against all Protestant Dissenters be repealed, and Legal Pro∣vision
made against their being disturbed by reason of their Consciences, and for their enjoying an equal Liberty with o∣ther Protestants. And that the Meekness and Purity of our Principles, and the Moderation and Righteousness of our End, may appear unto all Men, We do declare, That we will not make War upon, or destroy any for their Religion, how false and erronious so∣ever: So that the very Papists, provided they withdraw from the Tents of our Enemies, and be not found guilty of conspi∣ring our Destruction, or Abbettors of them that seek it, have nothing to fear on apprehend from us, except what may hinder their altering our Laws, and indangering our Persons in the Profession of the Reformed Doctrine, and Exercise of our Christian Worship. Our Resolution in the next place, is, To maintain all the just Rights and Privileges of Parliaments, and to have Parlia∣ments Annually chosen and held, and not prorogued, dissol∣ved or discontinued within the Year, before Petitions be first answered, and Grievances redressed. And seeing many of the Miseries under which the Nation doth groan, arise from displacing such out of the Number of Judges as would not, for the promoting Popish and Arbitrary Designs, wrest and mis-apply the Laws; and from constituting corrupt and mercenary Men in their Rooms, on purpose to stretch the Laws beyond the Reason and Intention of them, and to declare that for Law which is not; we can neither with Silence pass over the mentioning of them; nor should we have Peace in our selves, if we did not endeavour to pre∣vent the like Mischief in Time to come: For by reason of ill Men's being advanced to the Bench, and holding their Places only durante bene-placito, many Persons have been condemned in exorbitant Fines for no Crimes, or for very small ones: Many Statutes made for the Safety of the Subject, particular∣ly the Habeas Corpus Act, have been wickedly eluded, to the Oppression of the Innocent and Loyal Men. The Popish Lords that were impeached in Parliament, for a most hellish Conspiracy, have, to the subverting the Rights of the House of Lords, been discharged, and set free. The imposing a May; or and Sheriffs upon the City of London by Fraud and Violence have been justified; and those who, in discharge of their Du∣ty, opposed it, illegally prosecuted, and arbitrarily punished, London, and other Cities and Corporations, have been robbed of their Charters upon unrighteous Judgments of pretended Forfeitures. Sir Thomas Armstrong executed, without being allowed the Benefit of a Trial. Col. Algernoon Sidney con∣demned to die, upon the Deposition of one scandalous Wit∣ness. And that Loyal and Excellent Person, the late William Lord Russel, murthered for alledged Crimes; in reference to
which, if all had been true which was sworn against him, yet there was nothing which, according to Law, could have reach∣ed his Life. Upon the Consideration aforesaid, we further declare, that we will have Care taken for the future for de∣barring ignorant, scandalous and mercenary Men from the Administration of Justice; and that the Judges shall hold their Places by the ancient Tenure of quamdiu se bene gesserint; and to leave it to the Wisdom of a Parliament, to settle some Way, and Method for the Approbation of such as shall be advan∣ced to the Degree and Dignity of Judges. And forasmuch as the Invasion made on the Right of Ci∣ties, Burroughs and Towns Corporate; the Seisure of their Charters, whether by Surrender, or upon pretence of Borfei∣ture, have been wholly arbitrary and illegal; we likewise therefore declare, we will, to our utmost, endeavour to see them re-possessed in what they formerly had, and could legally lay claim to; and that we do esteem all Judgments given a∣gainst them, and all Surrenders made by a corrupt and per∣jured Party amongst them, null and void in Law; and do hold and declare their old Charters, notwithstanding the ew ones lately granted, to be good and valid: And accordingly, we do invite and encourage all honest Burgesses and Free-men to re-assume the Rights and Privileges which, by virtue of the said old Charters, belonged to their several and respective Corporations; and to deliver themselves from those late Parasites, and Instruments of Tyranny, set up to oppress them. Moreover, for the Restoring the Kingdom to its Primitive Condition of Freedom and Safety, we will have the Copora∣tion and Militia Acts repealed: And all Outlawries of Trea∣son against any Person whatsoever, upon the late pretend∣ed Protestant Plot, reversed; and also, all other Outlawries, Banishments, Warrants, Judgments, Imprisonments, and in∣jurious Proceedings against any other persons, upon any of the Penal Statutes made against Protestant Dissenters; made null and void. And we will have new Laws enacted for pla∣cing the Election of Sheriffs in the Freeholders of the several Counties, for Settling the Militia in the several Shires, and for Preventing all Military Standing ors, except what shall be raised and kept up by Authority and Consent of Par∣liament. And whereas several Gentlemen, and others, who have been worthy and zealous Assertors of the Protestant Interest, and Laws of the Kingdom, are now in Custody in divers Pla∣ces within the Realm, upon most unjust Accusations, Preen∣ces, Proceedings and Judgments; we do hereby further de∣clare their said Imprisonments to be illegal; and that in case any Violence shall be offered to them, or any of them, we will
revenge it to the utmost upon such of our Enemies as shall fall into our Hands. And whereas the said J. D. of Y. in order to the Expedi∣ting the Idolatrous and Bloody Designs of the Papists, the Gratifying his own boundless Ambition after a Crown, and to hinder Enquiry into the Assassination of Arthur, Earl of Es∣sex, hath poysoned the late King, and thereby manifested his Ingratitude, as well as Cruelty to the World, in mur∣thering a Brother who had almost ruined himself, to preserve and protect him from Punishment; We do therefore further declare, That for the aforesaid villainous and unnatural Crime, and other his Crimes before-mentioned, and in pur∣suance of the Resolution of both Houses of Parliament, who voted to revenge the King's Death in case he came to an Vn∣timely End, we will prosecute the said J. D. of Y. till we have brought him to suffer what the Law adjudged to be the Pu∣nishment of so execrable a Fact. And in a more particular Manner, His Grace the Duke of Monmouth, being sensible of the barbarous and horrid Parri∣cide committed upon his Father, doth resolve to pursue the said J. D. of Y. as a mortal and bloody Enemy; and will endeavour, as well with his own Hand, as by the Assistance of his Friends, and the Law, to have Justice executed upon him. And the said James, Duke of Monmouth, the now Head and Captain-General of the Protestant Forces of this King∣dom, assembled for the End aforesaid, from the Generousness of his own Nature, and the Love he bears to these Nations, whose Welfare and Settlement he infinitely prefers to whatso∣ever concerns himself, doth not at present insist upon his Title, but leaves the Determination thereof to the Wisdom, Justice and Authority of a Parliament, legally chosen, and acting with Freedom: And in the mean time, doth profess and declare, by all that is iacred, That he will, in Conjunction with the people of England, employ all the Abilities bestowed upon him by God and Nature, for the Re-establishment and Preservation of the Protestant Reformed Religion in these Kingdoms, and for Restoring the Subjects of the same to a free Exercise thereof, in opposition to Popery, and the Con∣sequences of it, Tyranny and Slavery. To the Obtaining of which End, he doth hereby Promise and Oblige himself to the People of England, to consent unto, and promote the Passing into Laws all the Methods aforesaid; that it may never more be in the Power of any single Person on the Throne to deprive their Subjects of their Rights, and to sub∣vert the Fundamental Laws of the Government, designed for their Preservation.
And whereas the Nobility, Gentry and Commons of Scot∣land, are now in Arms upon the like Motives and Inducements that we are, and in Prosecution of Ends agreeable with ours, we do therefore approve the Justice of their Cause, com∣mend their Zeal and Courage, expecting their, and promi∣sing our Assistance, for carrying on that glorious Work we are jointly engaged in; being obliged, for avoiding Tedious∣ness, to omit the Recounting many Oppressions under which that Kingdom hath groaned, and the giving a Diduction of the several Steps that have been taken for Introducing of Po∣pery and Tyranny. We think fit therefore to signifie both to our Countrymen and Foreigners, that we intend a larger Testimony and Remonstrance of the Grievances, Persecuti∣ons, Cruelties and Tyrannies we have late lain under; and therein, a more full and particular Account of the unparal∣lell'd Crimes of the D. of Y. And we make our Appeal unto GOD, and all Protestant Kings, Princes, States and People, concerning the Justice of our Cause, and the Necessity we are reduced unto of having our recourse to Arms. And as we do beseech, require and adjure all sincere Protestants, and true English Men, to be assisting to us, against the Enemies of the Gospel, Rights of the Nation, and Liberties of Man∣kind; so we are confident of obtaining the utmost Aid and Succour which they can yield us with their Prayers, Persons and Estates, for the Dethroning the said Tyrant, &c. Nor do we doubt being justified, countenanced and assisted by all Protestant Kings, Princes and Commonwealths, who either regard the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or their own Interest. And, above all, our Dependance and Trust is upon the Lord of Hosts, in whose Name we go forth, and to whom we commit our Cause, and refer the Decision betwixt us and our Enemies in the Day of Battel. Now let us play the Men for our People, and for the Cities of our GOD; and the Lord do that which seemeth good unto him. When the Prince of Orange heard of the Duke's Landing,The P. of O∣range's Of∣fers to King James re∣jected. and that he began to gather Strength, and was proclaimed King, he thought himself so far concerned, that he not only dispatched over the 6 English Regiments in the Dutch Pay, but also sent away Monsieur Bentink to the King, with Orders to acquaint him, That tho' he looked upon the Duke of Monmouth to be a Man of no great Parts, yet that he had a Warlike Ge∣nius, and was better skilled in the Military Art, than any the King was to employ against him; and that therefore, if His Majesty pleased, he would not only lend him his Troops, but come in Person also to Command his Army. But the same Thing in effect having been communicated to Skelton, at the Hague, he was so maliciously bent against the Prince and his
Interest, that he used such Diligence, as to give the King Notice of his Intentions before Bentink could arrive; and that with such evil Interpretation upon the Prince's Offer, that the King put off Monsieur Bentink, with telling him, He should acquaint his Master, that their common Interests did require the Prince his staying in Holland; and further opened his Mind unto him in such Terms, as sufficiently discover'd he did not take his Highness's Zeal for his Service to be at that time sea∣sonable. However, King James did well enough at this time, without such Assistance, and he was so far favoured in the Course of Providence, that the Duke was utterly Routed at Sedgmore, soon after taken, and ordered to be brought up to London forthwith, with no other Design, you may be sure, than to have his Head chopt off: However, not to be wanting to himself under such hard Circumstances, he thought fit on the 8th of July, to write the following Letter to the King, from Ringwood. SIR, YOUR Majesty may think,The D. of Monmouth's Letter to K. James. it is the Misfortune I now lie under, makes me make this Application to You: But I do assure Your Majesty, it is the Remorse I now have in me, of the Wrong I have done You in several Things; and now, in taking up Arms against You. For my taking up Arms: It never was in my Thoughts, since the King died: The Prince and Princess of Orange will be Witness for me, of the Assurance I gave them, That I would never stir against You. But my Misfortune was such, as to meet with some Horrid People, that made me believe Things of Your Ma∣jesty, and gave me so many false Arguments, that I was fully led away to believe, That it was a Shame, and a Sin before God, not to do it. But, SIR, I will not trouble Your Ma∣jesty, at present, with many Things I could say for my self, that, I am sure, would move Your Compassion. The chief End of this Letter, being only to beg of You, That I may have that Happiness, as to speak to Your Majesty: For, I have that to say to You, SIR, that, I hope, may give You a long and happy Reign. I am sure, SIR, when You hear me, You will be convinced of the Zeal I have for Your Pre∣servation, and how heartily I repent of what I have done. I can say no more to Your Majesty now, being this Letter must be seen by those that keep me. Therefore, SIR, I shall make an end, in begging of Your Majesty to believe so well of me, That I would rather die a Thousand Deaths, than ex∣cuse any Thing I have done, if I did not really think my self the most in the Wrong, that ever any Man was; and had not from the Bottom of my Heart an Abhorrence for those, that
put me upon it; and for the Action it self. I hope, SIR, God Almighty will strike Your Heart with Mercy and Com∣passion for me, as He has done mine with the Abhorrence of what I have done. Therefore, I hope, SIR, I may live to shew You, how zealous I shall ever be for Your Service; and could I say but one Word in this Letter, You would be con∣vinced of it; but it is of that Consequence, that I dare not do it. Therefore, SIR, I do beg of You once more, to let me speak to You; for then You will be convinced, how much I shall ever be, Your Majesty's most Humble and Dutiful MONMOUTH. What Impressions this, or what afterwards the Duke told him in Private, might have upon the King's Heart, I know not, but the Consequence proved, he little regarded it, by hastening of the Execution; which was done the next Day but one after his arrival,Monmouth Beheaded. upon Tower-Hill, July 15, unheard, by Virtue of an Attainder past upon him in this Parliament. A brave, but unhappy Man, not only in the Manner of his Death, but the Education of his Youth; whereby he became too much Tainted with the Vices of the then Court, where he could learn no better; but it was hoped, he did not end as he began; for, he said himself upon the Scaffold, and acknowledg∣ed it for a Mercy, That for 2 Years before, he had led a Bet∣ter, and more Reformed Life than ever. And here I can't but take Notice of the Manner wherewith some of those Di∣vines, who were appointed to assist him in the last Moments of his Life, treated the poor Gentleman; the main of all they said to him, being to press him to acknowledge their foppish Doctrine of Non-Resistance, which they alledged was such, that without it, he could not be a Member of the Church of England, as he profest himself to be. But all they could do, could not bring him to it; and in Truth, it would grieve any Heart, but such as was wofully prejudiced with the Bigot∣try of those Times, to find a Man under such Circumstances teazed, as he was, who by any Thing that appeared to the Contrary, was as much discomposed with that Way of Treat∣ment, as with the Death he was then ready to undergo. It was said, a certain Brave old Officer, who then came over with him, and since with the Prince of Orange, offered, with a small Party of Horse, to have ventured thro' all the Guards, and take him from off the Scaffold; But they could not be got together: His Time was come, and Providence de∣signed,
that our Deliverance should be more Just, Peaceable, and Wonderful; and that the Glory, as well as the many Bles∣sings we have since enjoyed, should be reserved to our Pious, and Renouned Monarch, King William, whom God grant long to Reign over us. But the Issue of Blood did not stop with the Duke's Death,The cruel Executions in the Wst. and the Executions that followed, were as Cruel, and Barba∣rous, as happened in any Age, or the worst of Tyrant's Reigns. I am very loath to enter into any of the Particulars, since all that have Travelled in the Western Parts, have been Eye-wit∣nesses of it for Years after this. It were enough to satisfie some, to say, that Jefferies the Chief Justice, now a Peer of England, forsooth, by the Title of Lord Jefferies, Baron of Wen, it had been better of Acheron, and the first Chief Ju∣stice after Hubert de Burg, I think, that was made so, had a Special Commission of Oyer and Terminer, to try the poor Wretches. But I'll give a few Particulars; The first that fell under his fiery Rage, was Alicia Lisle, a Woman of extream Age, and Relict of John Lisle, one of K. Charles 's Judges, who was Tryed at Winchester, for High-Treason, for Comfort∣ing and Assisting Rebels; the Pretence being, that she had Concealed Mr. Hicks, the Non-conformist Minister, and Ri∣chard Nelthrop, the latter being a perfect Stranger, and the former in no Proclamation, which made the Jury bring her in 3 times not Guilty; But at last Jefferies Threats so far prevail∣ed, that she was brought in Guilty of High-Treason, and Be∣headed for it. Yet the Convention after King William came in, were so dissatisfied in her Case, that tho' they could not restore her to Life, they Reversed the Judgment for her Death. From thence Jefferies Posts to Dorchester, where understand∣ing there were 30 Persons that had been found by the Grand Inquest, to have been Assisting the Duke of Monmouth, He con∣trived this Stratagem to dispatch them, for when they came upon their Tryals, and before they had Pleaded, he told them, That whosoever Pleaded Not Guilty, and was found so, should have little time to live; and if any expected Favour, they must Plead Guilty. But the Prisoners would not trust him, tho' it had in a manner been all one to them, for of the 30, 29 were found Guilty, and Executed soon after; as were o more our of 243, who were deluded to Plead Guilty to their Indictments. The same was done at Exeter to near as many, who were alike deluded; as also at Taunton, and Wells, where Jefferies finished his Bloody Assizes, and in which Two Places he Condemned above 500 Persons, whereof 239 were Executed, and had their Quarters set up in the principal Places, and Roads of those Countries, to the Terror of Passengers, and the great Annoyance of those Parts. But Jefferies was not the only Person that was the King's Agent in this bloody
Work; for Kirk, one of his Majesty's good Officers, had, after the Duke's Defeat, caused 90 wounded Men at Taunton, to be hanged, not only without permiting their Wives and Children to speak to them, but with Pipes playing, Drums beating, and Trumpets sounding; and boiled their Quarters in Pitch, to set them up in several Parts of the Town: Though Kirk was positive afterwards, when he was charg'd with being con∣cern'd in such Barbarity, That he had Instructions both from the King and his General to do what he did. But what In∣structions soever Kirk had for what he did, Jefferies took to himself a greater Latitude in Reprieving some who had Mo∣ney, and afterwards procuring Pardons for them; and he had the Conscience to take 14500 l. of one Man to save him, with which be bought a very fine Estate. But those poor Wretches, who could not purchase Pardons at my Lord's Rate, were fair∣ly sold for Slaves into the American Plantations: And when Ju∣stice could take place no longer, out came a Pardon, but so ridiculously Cruel, as Mr. Coke expresses it, as could scarcely be believed; for those who made their Escape were not only excepted, but also Girls of 8 or 9 Years old, who had made a few Colours, and presented them to the Duke of Monmouth, while he was at Taunton, were excepted by Name; and no Pardon could be purchased for this Treason, till the Girls Pa∣rents had paid more for it, than would have provided a Mar∣riage-Portion for them when at Age. By all which Passages you have very pregnant Examples, not only of the Avarice of the Ministers, but the King's Promise to imitate his Brother's Clemency and Tenderness to his People. Neither will any Man think his Majesty's Goodness to come short of the rest in his Severity to Mr. Cornish, who, in Oct. this Year, was taken up as he was freely following his Profession, and clapt close Prisoner in Newgate, without Pen, Ink, or Paper, or any Body to assist him, or as much as suffered to come at him; and about a Week after was Tryed upon an Indictment of High-Treason,Mr. Cornish Try'd. for that in the Year 1682, he had promised to be assisting to James, late Duke of Monmouth, William Russel, Esq Sir Thomas Armstrong, &c. in their Treasons against Charles I. Surely, one should think, his Brother had a mighty Respect for his Memory: But there was another Snake in the Grass; Mr. Cornish, when Sheriff of London, had been very active a∣gainst the Popish Conspirators; so that now nothing less than a Sacrifice of Humane Blood could appease the offended Ghosts of those that perished for that Plot. The only Witness against this poor Gentleman, was Col. Rumsey, who had plaid his Part before, and was easily believed here also; though no honest Man would have hanged a Dog upon his Evidence. As for what Dick Goodenough said, it was not very material, though it seemed to have been malicious enough▪ And I  heard
the Rascal, with Impudence enough, and many cursed Oaths, justifie what he said: So that the worthy Citizen was Cast and Executed;Mr. Cornish Executed. as much lamented for a Man of his Quality, and with such severe Censures from the Generality of People, up∣on the Hardship and Injustice done him, as any other in our Age whatsoever: And I have heard it said, That even King James himself, some time after, express'd somewhat of Regret concerning it. But, though Cornish his Case seemed to have been resented more particularly by the People in this Turmoil of the Times; yet the violent and rigorous Proceedings of the King and his bloody Agents did not pass unobserved,K. James's Proceedings in respect to Ireland. and left such Seeds of Discontent in the Minds of most, that though they did not pre∣sently bud forth, yet other Occasions made them in time ap∣pear to purpose: All this the Court could not not, or would not discern; so that they kept on their Pace, though yet a lit∣tle more covertly in England. But the Popish Designs ap∣peared by this time bare-faced enough in Ireland; for the King was no sooner settled in his Throne, but he began to turn out some Officers there, who had been most zealous for his Ser∣vice, and deserved better at his Hands, meerly because they had been counted firm to the Protestant Religion, and English Interest; particularly my Lord Shannon, Captain Robert Fitz-Gerald, Captain Richard Coote, Sir George St. George, and put into their Places one Kerney (a Ruffian, that designed to mur∣der Charles II.) Anderson, an obscure Fellow; Sheldon, a pro∣fest Papist; Graham, and some more of the Stamp; and at the same time sent for the Duke of Ormond very abruptly, and divested him of the Government of that Kingdom, to make way for Colonel Richard Talbot,Talbot's Villany. a Man of all others, most hated by the Protestants, to model the Army, and one who had been named by Oats in his Narrative Years before for this Service: So that many, who before believed nothing of the Plot, gave Credit to it now, saying, That if Oats were an ill Evidence, he was certainly a good Prophet. Talbot was no soon∣er invested with his Office, but he prosecuted it in such a manner, as might best be expected from a Man of so insolent a Temper, exercising at the same time, so much Barbarity and Falshood, that if the Army had not been the best Principled with Loyalty and Obedience in the World, they had Mutied, or at least sent him packing into another World. He would take an Officer in the Morning into his Closet, and with all the Oaths, Curses and Damnations that were never wanting to him, profess all Friendship and Kindness to him, and promise the Continuance of his Commission to him; but when the Af∣ternoon came, would casheer him with all the Contempt and Disgrace imaginable: Nay, perhaps, while he was thus cares∣sing him, he had actually given away his Commission to ano∣ther.
And if he thus Brutishly used the Officers, you cannot think he could be kinder and more mannerly towards the Sol∣diers and Troopers, whose way with them was, to march them from their usual Quarters, to some remote Place, where he thought they were least known, and would be put to greatest Hardships, and there he would strip them; the Foot of their Cloaths, for which they had paid, and the Troopers of their Horses, Boots and Accouterments, bought with their own Money, and set them to walk bare-footed an 100, and an 150 Miles to their Homes or Friends, if they had any. Its true, he would sometimes promise them something for their Horses, but then they must go to Dublin for it; and if any were so credulous as to go to demand the small Pittance he had promised them, or Arrears of Pay, he contrived it so, that they were obliged to wait till they had spent there as much as they expected, though most of them after all got nothing: By this mean 2 or 300 English Gentlemen, who had laid out all, or great Part of their Portions, or contracted Debts on Commissions, were left not worth any thing, and turn'd out without Reason or Consideration, and 5 or 6000 Soldiers sent a begging; and yet Bishop Tyrrel, so early as in July this Year, recommended this Talbot to the King, as a most fit Person to be Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and in some time he obtained it, besides the Dignity of Earl of Tir∣connell. King James by his wicked Instrument Talbot,K. James's Speech to his Parlia∣ment. finding he might do what he would in Ireland, thought he had now, his great Rival was taken off, a clear Field to do the same in Eng∣land; he had found his Parliament last Sessions extraordinarily plyable to his Desire; and therefore, at their next meeting in Nov. he told them, That the Militia, so much before de∣pended on, was not sufficient for his Occasions, and that no∣thing would do but a standing Force of well disciplin'd Troops, to defend him from all such as either at Home or Abroad were disposed to disturb the Nation: That therefore, the Concern he had both of his own and Subjects Tranquility, made him think it necessary to increase the Number as he had done. That he owed this as well to the Honour as Security of the Nation, whose Reputation had been so infinitely exposed to all its Neighbours, by being laid open to the late wretched Attempt, that it could not be repaired without keeping such a Body of Men on Foot, that none might ever have the Thoughts again of finding them so miserably unprovided; That therefore he required a Supply answerable to the Ex∣pence; and that he could not doubt, but what they had begun so much to the Honour and Defence of the Government, would be continued by them, with all the Cheerfulness and Readiness that was requisite for a Work of so great Impor∣tance.
But then he came to the Nice Point, and said, That no Man should take Exception, that some Officers in the Ar∣my were not qualified for their Imployments, according to the late Tests; for that he must tell them, those Gentlemen, were most of them, well known to him, and having formerly served him on several Occasions, and always approved the Loyalty of their Principles by their Practice, he thought them now fit to be imployed under him, and that he would deal plainly with them; That after having had the Benefit of their Services, in such a time of Need and Danger, he would neither expose them to Disgrace, nor himself to the Want of them, if there should be another Rebellion to make them necessary to him: Then he cajol'd them with what Feats he had already done for the Nation, and how much more he would do still, even to the Hazard of his Life, in the Defence and true Interest of the Nation, and hoped, no groundless Fears and Jealousies should put a Stop thereunto; with something more to the same Purpose, which I shall not trouble my self nor the Reader with, but come to tell him; that both Houses entered into a Debate upon the Speech.The Lords Voted Thanks for the Speech. Some of the Lords were against re∣turning his Majesty Thanks for it, and spoke pretty smartly to the Matter, but the Majority were for it; and it was said, the late Marquess of Hallifax should say, That they had now more Reason than ever to do it, since the King had been so plain with them, and discovered what he would be at. But it did not pass so hastily with the Commons;The Com∣mons deba∣ted it, and addrest the King to turn our the Popish Offi∣cers. for they debated it Paragraph by Paragraph, and because the Militia had not been so serviceable as the King would have them, they Voted they would take it into Consideration how to make them more useful for the fu∣ture, and on the 16th of Nov. Addrest the King; wherein they represented to him, that they had taken his Speech, and particularly that part of it relating to the unqualified Officers into their Consideration; That for what was past, they were preparing a Bill to pass both Houses for the Royal Assent, to indemnifie them from the Penalty they had incurred by Law; but because the Continuance of them in their Imployments might be thought to be a dispensing Power with that Law, without Act of Parliament; They therefore humbly be∣sought him, that he would be pleased to give such Directi∣ons therein, that no Apprehensions or Jealousies might re∣main in the Hearts of his good and faithful Subjects: But what do you think was the Consequence of this Address? 'Twas no other than first a Prorogation,Parliament dissolved. and then the Disso∣lution of the Parliament, and the King left at Liberty to pur∣sue his Designs in the best Methods he could for the Introdu∣cing of Popery and Arbitrary Power; and where at present we leave him.
Its a long Step from England to Hungary, I confess, but there being no considerable Affairs in Motion now nearer Home, we are necessitated to look so far; and here to remind you first of the ill Success of the Imperial Army before Buda last Year, which after such Repulses and so many Weeks Siege, they were forced to quit at last; And now we are to see whe∣ther they have not made a better Progress this Campaign; to which End, I am to acquaint you, That the Duke of Lorain, arrived in the Imperial Camp, between Neuheusel and Barkan, June 13, where, after divers Consultations, it was resolved at last,Neuheusel Besieged by the Im∣perialists. formally to Besiege Neuheusel, which in some measure had been block'd up ever since the Winter before. In pursu∣ance thereof, the Army, July 4, began a slow March towards the Place, which had a good Garrison in it, and is a large Fort situated upon a firm Foundation, though the Plain about it is full of a Morass and Fenny Grounds, which made the Town almost unaccessible, as its Strength was almost invincible, ha∣ving 6 Bastions lined with a very good Stone-Work, without which there was a vast Ditch of about 10 Foot deep, and 20 broad. The River Neutra runs on the East, not above a Pistol shot from it, as the Danube is on the South, about 2 Furlongs distance, and the River Schit, on the West. The whole Im∣perial Army, with the Auxiliary Troops of Bavaria and Lu∣nemburg, being posted with some Difficulty about the Place; the Trenches were opened July 11, at Night, by 3000 Foot, on whom the Besieged fired all along without doing any great Execution, and by the 13th, they were carried on within 50 Paces of the Ditch, when they had also finished a Redoubt: But next Day the Enemy made a Sally with a Party of Horse upon the Bavarian Guard, yet were quickly beaten back into the Town with some Loss, and that ight the Besiegers finish∣ed another Redoubt on the Left, and the Line of Communi∣cation between the Trenches, in the middle whereof they be∣gan to raise a Battery of 10 Pieces of Cannon, and at the same time began a false Attack on the South, opposite to the true one, which gave the Besieged a Diversion that way. On the 15th they played upon one another briskly with their Cannon, and at Night the Besiegers got to the Ditch in seve∣ral places, both on the Right and Left, but with considerable Loss; and on the 16th, the Imperialists began a new Battery against the Pallisadoes before the Gate, which set fire to them, and forced the Turks to abandon that Place. They continued also their Works next Day, and prepared Things to fill the Ditch, to which End the Duke of Lorain ordered the Lunemburghers on the Left, to cut a Canal, to let the Water out of it into the Neutra, when at the same time receiving Advice, that the Turkish Army was marched towards Gran, he sent Colonel Heusler out towards Vicegrade, with a Body of Horse, to get
Intelligence, and 500 Dragoons, under the Count of Stirum, to pass one of the Bridges near Comorra, and to post himself near Gran; and 5 Days after upon further Advice, command∣ed the Dragoons of Bavaria and Brunswick, together with the Imperial Dragoons, making in all about 5000 Thousand, un∣der the Command of the Count de Lodron, to march towards Comorra, to cover the Bridges, which his Highness had caused to be laid there over the Danube, while he in the mean time bestirred himself with wonderful Activity, to push on the Siege, being every Day present in the Trenches, and upon the Bat∣teries, to give all necessary Orders; as being very desirous to be Master of this Place. But notwithstanding all his Indu∣stry, and the continued Advances that were made in the Siege, the Turks defended themselves so well, that the Month of July spun out, and the Additional Presence and Assistance of Prince Waldeck, and the Elector of Bavaria, who by this time were got to the Camp, were little enough to keep up the droop∣ing Spirits of the Besiegers, who began to be very much de∣jected with the frequent Losses they had sustained by the Can∣non of the Place, and the frequent Sallies of the Besieged; and the Duke had not his End effected before he was obli∣ged with the greatest Part of the Army to march and fight the Enemy. For on the 1st of Aug. having received certain Advice,The Turks Besiege Gran. that the 500 Foot he had detached under Major Rounkell, had happily got into Gran, but that the same day the Serasquier Basha, with an Army of between 50 and 60000 Men had begun to besiege that Place; he immediately thereupon called a Council of War, where many were of Opinion, that the Go∣vernour of Gran being so well provided, that he could easily defend the Town for two Months it were their best way vigo∣rously to pursue the Siege of Newheusel, and not to meddle withthe Turkish Army till they had something weakned them∣selves before Gran: But the Majority concluded it most advisa∣ble to march with the greatest part of the Army to fight the Turks, and to leave a sufficient Body to carry on, at the same time, the Siege of Newheusel. Whereupon an Officer was sent to Vienna, to acquaint the Emperor with the said Resolution; who returned again on the 3d to the Camp, with the Emperor's Approbation of what they had resolved on. The Duke, in the mean time, having ordered several Retrenchments to be made, for the greater security of those that were to be left to continue the Siege; and they being almost finished by the 5th of August, he began his March that Day. We shall at present follow the Duke of Lorrain in his March, and give you an Account of the Issue of it, and then return to Newheusell. Aug. 8, he passed the Danube, near Comorra; and next Day reached to Dotis, otherwise called Thasa; from
whence his Highness, with the Elector of Bavaria, advanced to∣wards the Enemy, with a design to Attack them in their Camp before Gran▪ if they came not out to fight them. As they approached nearer, they understood how vigorously the Turks pushed on the Siege of Gran, and the brave Resistance the Garrison continued to make. On the 14th, a Renagado Po∣lander, who had for some time served the Turks, came into the Imperial Camp, and inform'd the Duke of Lorrain, that the Turks believing the Imperialists not above 20000 strong, had resolved to Attack them: Upon which Information, the Duke who was encamped with the Army near a Morass which covered the Turks, resolved to retire that very Night an Hours March, thereby to confirm the Enemy in their Opinion of the weak∣ness of the Christian Forces; which being effected in very good Order, the Turks, without losing any time, passed the Morass,The Battel of Gran. thinking to surprize the Imperialists in their Retreat. But they were strangely mistaken, for they found them drawn up in very good Order; Yet they fell on with their usual Shouts, and charged the Right Wing, commanded by the Elector of Bavaria; and afterwards the Left Wing, where the Duke of Lorrain was in Person; and likewise endeavoured to flank them, but they were beaten off with the greatest Bravery ima∣ginable. With this being somewhat discouraged, but much more in that they found themselves deceived in the Account they had of the Strength of the Imperialists, they began to fall into great Disorder, which was very much encreased by the Discharge of 30 Pieces of Cannon, laden with Small-shot, with which (the Imperial Troops opening) they fired upon them, and made a great Slaughter; And at the second Discharge they fled, being pursued by the first Line of the Christians, and a great many illustrious Voluntiers, who on this Occasion gave great Proofs of their Courage. While they repassed the De∣files on the side of the Morass, the Imperial Troops follow∣ed them very close; and cutting in pieces all that opposed them, they entred their Camp, and made themselves Masters of it, where they took all their Tents, Baggage, and Artillory, the latter consisting of 23 Pieces of Cannon, and 4 Mortars; the Enemy at the same time fleeing towards Buda, while the Hun∣garians and Croats, with a Detachment of Cuirassiers and Dra∣goons, commanded by the Baron de Merci, the Count de Sti∣rum, and Colonel Heusler, were sent in pursuit of them. This Victory was so much the more signal and advantageous to the Imperialists, in that tho' there were 4000 Janisaries and 2000 Spahi's of the Enemy slain, yet it did not cost the former a∣bove 100 Men,Vicegrade taken by the Turks. and among them no Person of Note,. But Vicegrade had unhappily fallen into the Turks Hands before this; for while the Serasquier was engaged in the Siege of Gran, (before which he lost near 3000 Men,) he had snt, before
the Duke came up, a Detachment of 12000 to Attack it, ha∣ving then only a Garrison of 300 Christians, who yet made a very brave Defence, till at length, the Enemy having made a Breach with their Cannon and Mines, they Capitulated to march out with their Arms and Baggage to the Danube, where they Embarked, and were conducted by Water to the Impe∣rial Army 5 while the Enemy thought fit to demolish the Place. But this was nothing in comparison of the aforesaid Victo∣ry,Neuheusel taken by Storm. or the Taking of Newheusel, that followed; which hap∣pened after this manner; The Besiegers having made their Approaches by Galleries, Cannon and Mines so far, that a Breach was made at one of the Bastions, which was so broad, that 3 Men might enter a breast, General Caprara, and the Duke of Croy having called a Council of War thereupon, resol∣ved to give a general Assault the next Day being Aug. 19, and sent their Commands into all Quarters to provide accordingly: So that first having sprung 3 Mines about the said Bastion and Curtain, which, tho' they had not the desired Effect so as to ruin some Retrenchments of the Besieged, yet they so far bene∣fited the Christians as to facilitate the Assault, by opening a Gap 12 Foot wide, and of a pretty easie Assent. Hereupon, they immediately fired upon the Town from all Quarters; which put the Turks within into such a Consternation, that, for a Time, scarce a Man durst appear; so that laying hold of the Oppor∣tunity, whilst they played also with their Bombs and Carcasses upon the Besieged, the Count of Scherffenburg was the first that entred the Place, on the Right side of the Bastion; The Sieur Ronimel at the same time pushing in at the new Breache, a little on the Left; General Dumont, who commanded the Lunem∣burghers, vigorously backing the Assault. This Vigour of the Christians brought the Besieged to set up two white Flags upon their Retrenchments; but the former were now so eager, that there was no bridling of them, so that they immediately mount∣ed the new Retrenchments, and after a little Opposition, the Imperialists rushed all into the Town, putting all they found to the Sword. Hassan, the Basha was brought desperately wounded, to General Caprara; and about 10 Officers more were Saved. Besides the great quantity of Ammunitition and Provisions they found there, they had also 75 pieces of Cannon; which Cannon they had all dismounted save 6. Of this Success the Duke of Lorrain was advertised, as he was upon his March from Gran, with an Intention to put the finishing Hand to it himself; which made him alter his Motion, and go in quest of the Enemies Army, who rallied about Buda; and whom he could not draw to a second Engagement during the rest of the Campaign. How∣ever, he had done in Hungary so much already, that the Seras∣quier thought fit, towards the latter end of August, to send an Aga to his Highness; who, after having kissed his Hands, and
lifted them up to his Forehead, presented to him a large Letter, wrapped up in a piece of Crimson Sattin; of which this is an exact Translation: TO Our good Friend,The Seras∣quier's Let∣ter to the D. of Lorain. the Duke of Lorain, present Generalis∣simus of the Emperor of the Germans, Greeting. We make known as a good Friend, that Achmet Deschelebi, formerly Defrerdo (which is as much as to say Commissary) of the Timarriotes of the Fortress of Neuheusel, having represented to V, your Friend, in case We desire a Negotiation of eace, We ought to send Letters to which you might give Credit: For this Cause these Presents have been written, and sent unto You. And as We, your Friend, desire hereby, for the Service of the Creatures of God, that means may be found to restore the Tranquility of the Subjects on both sides, and a good Order and Regulation in this Kingdom, and that our Repu∣tation, and that of those who shall have part in this Action, may be spread all over the whole Earth, by the Acclamations of the People, seeing, We desire not the Destruction of the Poor, nor the Ruin of Countries. What We now say, as well as what We do in Pursuance of Our Word, has been approved of (for God would have it so) by the Majesty of Our Resplendent, Puissant, and Formidable Empe∣ror and King of the Superficies of the whole Earth. Wherefore We have sent to You the said Achment Deschelebi, to whom We have entrusted certain Things to impart to You by Word of Mouth, if consequently You will send to Vs a trusty Person on Your Part, to treat of a Peace, and the Re-establishment of the Publick Quiet, we hope to enter into Conference. Whereupon, salute in the Name of Your Fellows, the true Direction. Given in the Camp of Pst. IPRADIM. After this, the Aga prayed His Highness to contribute all he could on his part towards the putting an End to a War which had caused the Effusion of so much Blood, and had been the Ruine of so many poor People; and saying, That he thought His Highness, after so glorious a Campaign, ought the more readily to consent to a Peace; and offering, in the Grand Seignior's Name, to abandon Count Tekely, and even to deliver to the Emperor the Hostages he had now at the Port. To this the Duke of Lorain answered, That a vi∣ctorious Army was not to be amused with Overtures of Peace; and that he had no Instructions to hearken to any; But that he would acquaint His Imperial Majesty with the Serasquier Proposals. And so we leave this Matter at present, and see what the Cermans have been doing in other Places all this time.
For if the Duke of Lorrain, with the grand Army, was thus active in Hungary, General Lesley, in Croatia, was not idle on his side neither; For, having formed a Design against Esseck, he left his heavy Cannon and Baggage at Virovitza, and on the 9th of Aug. directed his March towards Monstarocina, where he arrived on the 10th; and that Evening he detached 500 Croats, and some Foot, to invest Michalowitz, wherein were 60 Turks only, who immediately surrender'd at Discreti∣on; and into which Place the General having put 200 Men, he continued his March towards Caranissa, while the Turks ha∣ving made several Signals from the Castles they had near the Drave, and sent out Parties to alarm those of Esseck, made the Basha of that Place to advance with 600 Horse to charge the Count's Van-guard. He bravely repulsed him, and for∣ced him to retire with considerable Loss; so that the Gene∣ral, by the 14th, was got into the great Plain, not far from Esseck, when he discovered a Body of about 1000 Turkish Horse; but their Foot, whose Number the Christians could not exactly observe, were posted nearer the Town. This made him immediately draw up his Troops in Battalia, and command the Croats of the 2 Wings to advance, and charge the Enemy; which they did with that Resolution, that the Turks fell presently into Disorder, and soon after fled; the Foot at the same time making all the haste they could to get into the Town and Castle. Hereupon, the Count gave Or∣ders to his Troops to attack the Town; which they perform∣ed with wonderful Courage, scaling the Walls, which were of no great Defence, and entring the Place with their Swords in their Hands; the Turks all this while endeavouring to save themselves, with their Wives and Children; some by Water, others by endeavouring to get into the Castle; when of the former, many were taken in little Boats. The General gave the Pillage of the Town to the Soldiers; and having posted Guards to secure the Avenues of the Castle, he went to view the Bridge, which was 80000▪ Paces in length on the other side of the Drave, and 1100 Paces on this side, and 12 broad; but he found the Turks had broken down part of it on the other side of the River, to hinder the Christians pursuing them, and that it would be very difficult to burn it; therefore he contented himself to burn that part of it which stood on this side the Drave, which was quite destroyed: And having thus executed his Design, with the Loss of no more than 60 Men, he returned to Michalowitz, to refresh his Troops, and to ex∣pect a further Re-inforcement, in order to go upon some new Adventure: But soon after he happening to fall sick, and the Turks, by this last Loss, provoked to a greater Vigilance, there was nothing further of moment performed that Way.
But as for Vpper Hungary, what General Schultz failed in last Year, he was resolved to perform this: And therefore, one of the first Things he did,Esperies be∣sieged by General Schultz. was, to set down before Esperies; by taking whereof, he did not question but to straighten the Bounds of the Rebel-Party, and enlarge those of the Imperia∣lists very much; But he found it an harder Task to reduce the Place than he was aware of: For, tho' after many Days Siege, he gave Notice to the Burghers of the Emperor's general Am∣nesty that was lately published; and that it was now high time for them to think of indemnifying themselves; and that such an Opportunity, if let slip, was not to be retrieved; yet they were so far from taking the Advantage of it, that they fell upon the Officer sent to them upon that Account, whom they barbarously murthered; which so enraged the General, that he commanded the Town to be stormed. But the Besieged made so desperate a Defence, that the Germans, after a Fight of 2 Hours and an half, and the Loss of about 300 Men, re∣tired, in expectation of a Re-inforcement from the main Ar∣my, in order to perfect the Work. But before that was done, and somewhat to the Surprize of the General, the Governour of the Town sent to desire a Parly, it being the 10th of Sept. and a Cessation of Hostilities till next Morning, that he might in the mean time call together the Inhabitants, to deliberate with them concerning the Articles to Surrender. The General believing his Design therein was to gain Time, he would not grant it; but demanded to have 2 Officers immediately sent to him for Hostages: This the Besieged would not agree to, and so on the Firing went on both sides.Surrendred. But the next Day, the Governour understanding the Besiegers would in a few Days be re-inforced with the afore-mentioned Detach∣ment, desired another Parley; wherein, after a little Con∣testation, the Terms were agreed on, and the Town actually put into the Germans Hands on the 12th. Now, if the Im∣perialists valued themselves much upon the Advantages that would accrue to them by the Taking in of Esperies, the Consequences of it, perhaps, exceeded far their own Expectations: For, besides, Tokay, Potock, Onotz, and divers other Places, which quickly fell into their Hands, the Ci∣ty of Caschaw was also taken by General Caprara; Agria bombarded by the Baron de Merci; and all the Country round it ravaged and destroyed; and then the Troops went into their Winter-Quarters, the Bounds whereof they had considerably enlarged in that part of Hungary this Cam∣paign. I have nothing to say concerning the Feats of the Poles this Season, unless it be, that they did suffer their Provinces of Podolia, &c. to be ravaged by the Tartars; came themselves late into the Field, not under the Conduct of the King,
but of the Crown-General; and besides a Skirmish or two with some of the Enemies Parties, and threatning to invade Moldavia, or some of those Dynasties, did nothing else but re∣turn again to their Quarters. But the Venetians made far better Work of it;The Siege and Battel of Coron. for, after considerable Preparations made, and divers Consultations had, at length the Captain-General Francisco Morosini, considering the vast Importance of Coron, could he take it for the Use of the Republick, set sail in the Month of July, for that Place; But scarce had the Venetians approached the Place, when a great Body of Turks came down from the Country, and took their Lodgments within Pistol-shot of the Christians; which wonderfully animated the Besieged, who were already of themselves sufficiently bent to make an obstinate Resistance, especially considering the Advantages they had by the steep and difficult Situation of the Town, the Abundance of Provi∣sion and Ammunition they were stored with, besides their own Strength and Number, which was very considerable: And, indeed, to say the Truth of them, the Besieged, and Turks without, acted for the Preservation of the Place, whatever might be expected from desperate and brave Men. They at∣tempted several times to become Masters of a Bonnet, which commanded the Venetian Camp, but they were stil repulsed, though it retarded the Besiegers, and was an Hindrance for them to carry on their Works: Then the General sprung a Mine, wherein were an 100 Barrels of Powder, which was perform'd on the 24th of July; but it had not the desired Effect, quite contrary to the Hopes of the Success of this Work, which so encouraged the Turks, that they broke into the Venetian Lines to gain their desired Object, the fore-men∣tioned Bonnet: Yet, when they thought themselves secure of it, the General poured in upon them a good Body of Horse and Dragoons, which being seconded by the Maltese Forces, attack'd them at the very Entrance of the Bonnet, with so much Resolution and Valour for the Space of 3 Hours, during which time the Combate very obstinately lasted; that at last the Venetian Forces replanted their White Colours upon the Place; the Turks that were driven from it endavouring to shelter themselves under the Covert of the adjacent Trees, but that Place was quickly made too hot to hold them also. They lost in the whole of their Number 400, and had as ma∣ny wounded; but the Venetians had not above 130 killed and wounded in all on their side; and even to sweeten that Loss, they got by the Action several rich Spoils; and, amongst other Things, 17 Standards. When they returned into their Trenches, they exposed 130 Turks Heads to the View of the Besieged, thinking thereby to terrifie them into a Surrender; ut, for all this, they continued nothing less obstinate in the
Defence of the Place; which provoked the Venetians, on the other hand, to give them more terrible Effects of their Reso∣lution and Power, by the most furious Discharge of their Can∣nons, Bombs, and Stones upon them; while at the same time, which was July 30, the Turks rallied again after their Flight, their Strength being considerably augmented by a great Num∣ber of Soldiers they had drawn together from all Parts of the Morea, and by the Forces of the Captain-Basha, and attempted a second time, with greater Fury than before, to throw them∣selves into the Venetian Trenches; yet they were bravely re∣pulsed, and encountred with a Shower of Musket-shot and Granadoes, so that they were forced not only to retreat, but were pursued by Col. Bianchli's Regiments, with 200 Dra∣goons, to their own Retrenchments, with the Loss of 400 Men; which was so much the more heightned, in that a Can∣non-Ball took off Kalil Basha, Visier Commander General of the Ottoman Army. However, all these Disadvantages would not abate the Turkish Pride, and bring them to yield; for they knew still where to be recrulted with fresh Troops, and omit∣ted not daily to disturb the Venetians in their Trenches: Which Obstinacy of the Turks, together with the Venetians, being in this manner from within and without much harrassed with continual Action, greatly lessened their Numbers; so that the General saw plainly there was no lingring on the Mat∣ter, but that either he must make some bold Attempt, or draw off: Wherefore, having first ruminated it in himself, he then proposed the Design to a Council of War; which was, To adventure to force the Enemies Camp; and which, perhaps, contrary to his Expectation, was approved of by them: Here∣upon, he drew out of the Gallies 1500 Voluntiers, who, un∣der the Command of Lieutenant-General Magnani, landed a∣bout Midnight; and next Day, being Aug. 7, 1200 of them filed off to the Left of the Enemies Retrenchments by the Entrance of a Valley, the rest of them at the same time mo∣ving to the Right, while some other Troops were held in a Readiness to follow their Motions, and give them speedy Suc∣cour, as Necessity required, in order to favour and promote the Design. The Twilight of the next Morning being come, 2 Barrels of Powder were fired as a Signal, which was immediately fol∣lowed with a Discharge of all the Cannon, and furious Salvo's of all the Musketeers, with a continual firing both on the Front and Flank of the Enemies Camp; which brisk and unexpected Assault, put the Turks into very great Disorder, and the forward∣est of them began to flinch and give back, without being able to be heartned up by the Example of the most undaunted, or Commands of their Officers; So that the Venetians finding such weak Resistance, they fell on with the greater Fury, and
made a great Slaughter among the Turks, scare any escaping their Swords, and all this with little Loss to themselves. They found also in the Turks Camp, a very rich Booty of Artillery, Arms, Ammunition and Provision, with about 300 Horses, Tents, Standards, and 6 Brass Guns, 3 whereof were marked with St. Mark of Venice, besides the Imperial Standard adorned with 3 Horse-Tails. The Venetians, after so fortunate an Ad∣venture, finding themselves free from the great Obstacles of the Turks that were encamped without the Walls, and now Ma∣sters of the Field, were big with Hopes of soon putting the Besieged out of all Thoughts of further Defence; wherefore they prepared for a general Assault, and for that End sprung a Mine, whose Effect was to bring them to an Attack, which lasted for 3 Hours together, the Besieged withstanding them with incredible Valour and Opposition, fatal to a great many Noble Venetians and Valiant Soldiers, who perished there: This considerable Loss gave a few Moments breathing to the Attack; but the Courage wherewith they fell on afresh, made the Besieged see it high time to think of a Capitulation, which they made a Sign of, by hanging out a White Standard upon the Ramparts; whereupon Arms were laid down, in order to regulate the Articles: But this was only an Artifice of Turkish Perfidy, to make a feigned shew of Rendition, with a real De∣sign to procure a greater Loss to the Besiegers, by a brisk and unexpected Sally; which so incensed the Venetians, that they took a firmer Resolution than ever, to put an end to the Siege, which had already continued 49 Days;Coron taken. wherefore, having first swept the Ramparts with their Shot, they bravely mount∣ed the Walls, and entred the Town, where being heated, as they were with the Baseness of the Enemy, and the Assault they were now engaged in, they made a dreadful Slaughter of all the Inhabitants, without distinction either of Age or Sex. They found in the Place 128 Pieces of Cannon, whereof 66 were Brass, besides a great Quantity of Ammunition and Pro∣vision. This Work being now at last happily accomplished by the Captain-General, after he had staid so long at Coron, till the Fortifications were so far repaired, as to make the Place de∣sensible, he resolved to do all he could to encourage the Peo∣ple of the Province of Maina, in the Disposition they appear'd to be, to cast off the Ottoman Yoak: And, to that Purpose, sent the Mainots, who came in to him upon the Taking of Co∣rou, with some other Troops, to attack Zarnata, one of the strongest of the 3 Fortresses built by the Turks, since the Can∣dian War, to keep those People in awe. And some Days after, having caused the Army to embark, the whole Fleet set sail from Coron, and the next Day arrived at Chitie, about 5Miles from Zarnata, where they were joined by the Ships that had
on Board the Saxon Troops, consisting of 3000 Men; and from whence the Fleet sailed towards Calamata, near which Place the Forces landed again. However, all these Motions could not be managed with that Expedition and Secresie, but that the Captain Basha having notice thereof, he dispatched ashoar what Men he could, out of the Turkish Gallies, which he left at Napoli di Romania, securing the Port with great Chains; and, being joined by a great Body of Horse and Foot, march∣ed towards Calamata, to keep the Mainotes from revolting to the Venetians. This the Captain-General had no sooner No∣tice of, but he sent an Officer to the Garrison of Zarnata, to let them know, that if they did not immediately surrender the Place, they must expect to be treated in the same Manner they of Coron had been: Whereupon the Garrison desired that they might send to the Captain Basha, to acquaint him with the Condition they were in, which was granted. But the Of∣ficer not returning at the time appointed, they gave up the Place on the 11th of Sept. the Men marching away with Bag and Baggage; yet the Aga, who commanded them, fearing he should be ill treated by the Captain Basha, staid in the Ve∣netian Camp, towards which the Basha was now advanced, at the Head of 10000 Men, with a Resolution to fight the Chri∣stians; which the Captain-General Morosini did not decline on his part. For he marched towards the Enemy, feigning at the same time to make a Descent, to give them a Diversion in some other Place; For which Purpose he had caused some Troops to embark, and commanded the Fleet to keep along the Coast. The Venetians, who came up with the Enemy on the 14th, were drawn up in Battalia by General Degenfield, on an ad∣vantageous Ground: The Turks, on the other side, having put themselves into a Posture to receive them, their Horse fell im∣mediately upon the Venetians Left Wing, while a great Body of their Foot at the same time advanced towards their Right, at the Head of which was the Prince of Brunswick, but they found so brave a Resistance, that they were forced to retire; yet they presently after returned, and charged a second time with greater Fury than before. The Fight was maintained with great Courage and Resolution on both sides for a time, till at last the Turks being no longer able to keep their Ground, fell into Disorder, and soon after dispersed and fled, leaving a great Number of their Men slain behind them, and the Gar∣rison of Calamata to fire the Magazine, and abandon the Place, which the Venetians immediately took Possession of; as they did soon after of Porto Vitulo, which the Mainotes took for them: Of Chielifa, a strong Fortress not far from the other, Place, and Passavania; whereby the Republick became pos∣sess'd of the whole Province of Mayna, whereof the Captain-General made Seignior Lorenzo Venier Governour; and so glori∣ously
ended this Campaign. And I shall end this Year with taking Notice, that it was fatal to the Liberty of the Re∣formed Gallican Church, the Edicts of Nants and Nismes be∣ing utterly revoked by another of the 22th of Oct. and those made null and finite, which were looked upon irrevocable and perpetual; the Consequence whereof all the World has seen and heard, and therefore I shall say nothing of it in this place. We have left England last with the King's Dissolving his Parliament, now it is time to see a little how he carried him∣self. His Brother had laid the Foundation of making a Par∣liament Felo de se, by hectoring and making Bargains with Cor∣porations, to give up their Charters, and take new ones from him; wherein he reserved a Power, that if they did not return such Members as pleased him, he would resume the Charters he granted them, and herein he made a great Pro∣gress: But his Keeper and Attorney-General refused to grant Patents to such poor Corporations, as could not pay their Fees, at length the Keeper having kickt up his Heels last Year, and Jefferies advanced to be Lord Chancellor, and the Attorney turned out, with another put into his Place that would with greater Charity perform the Office; these Remora's to the King's Designs were removed; Yet there was another Pace to be made still, which was to make the Judges in Westminster-Hall to murder the Common Law, as well as the King and his Bro∣ther designed to murder the Parliament by it self. To this End his good Majesty, before he would make any Judges, would enter into a Bargain with them, that they should de∣clare the King's Power of dispensing with the Penal Laws and Tests, made against Recusants out of Parliament: However, it was said, the King stumbled at the Threshold, for beginning with Sir Thomas Jones, who had deserved so well in Mr. Cornish his Tryal and others; he boggl'd very much at it, saying plain∣ly, he could not do it; to which the King answered, He would have Twelve Judges of his Opinion; and Sir Thomas replied, He might have 12 Judges of his Opinion, but would scarce find Twelve Lawyers to be so. But for all this the King went on, and would gain his Point in favour of Dissenters, at leastwise, as to the gaining his Prerogative in Westminster-Hall; and when he thought he had gone pretty far that way, he granted a Com∣mission of Ecclesiastical Affairs, which yet was not opened till the 3d of Aug. though it had been Sealed some Months be∣fore. But at last out it came; and, whereas I have never yet seen it Printed but once, and lest the same should be forgotten, I shall insert it in this place; and it runs in the following Terms.

And whereas our Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and divers Cathedral and Colleg;ate Churches, Colleges, Grammar-Schools, and other Ecclesia∣stical Incorporations have been erected, founded and endow∣ed by several of our Royal Progenitors, Kings and Queens of this Realm, and some others, by the Charity and Bounty of some of their Subjects, as well within our Universities, as o∣ther Parts and Places, the Ordinance, Rules and Statutes, whereof are either imbezilled, lost, corrupted, or altogether imperfected; We do therefore give a full Power and Autho∣rity to you, or any five, or more of you, of whom we will, you the afore-named Lord Chancellor always to be one, to cause and command in our Name, all, and singular the Ordi∣nances, Rules and Statutes of our Universities, and all, and every Cathedral, and Collegiate Churches, Colleges, Gram∣mar-Schools, and other Ecclesiastical Incorporations, toge∣ther with their several Letters Patents, and other Writings touching, or in any wise concerning the several Erections and Foundation to be brought and exhibited before you, or any five, or more of you as is aforesaid, whereof you the said Lord Chancellor to be one, willing, commanding, and au∣thorizing you, or any five, or more of you, as aforesaid, where∣of you the said Lord Chancellor to be one, upon the Exhibit∣ing, and upon diligent and deliberate View, Search, and Examination of the said Statutes, Rules and Ordinances, Let∣ters Patents, and Writings, as is aforesaid, the same to Cor∣rect, Amend and Alter.

and the publick Weale and Tranquility of this our Realm. Moreover, our Will, Pleasure, and Commandment is, That our said Commissioners, and every of you, shall diligently and faithfully execute this our Commission, and every part and branch thereof in Manner and Form aforesaid, and ac∣cording to the true Meaning hereof, notwithstanding any Appellation, Provocation, Priviledge, or Exemption in that behalf, to be made, pretended, or alledged by any Person, or Persons, resident, or dwelling in any Place, or Places, ex∣empt, or not exempt, within this our Realm, any Law, Sta∣tutes, Proclamations, or Grants, Priviledges, or Ordinances, which be, or may seem to be contrary to the Premises not∣withstanding. And for the better Credit, and more manifest Notice of your doing in Execution of this our Commission, our Pleasure and Commandment is, That to your Letters Mis∣sive, Processes, Decrees, Orders and Judgments, for, or by you, or any three, or more of you, as is aforesaid, to be a∣warded, sent forth, had, made, decreed, given, or pronoun∣ced, at such certain publick Places, as shall be appointed by you, or any three, or more of you, as is aforesaid, for the due Execution of this our Commission, or some three, or more of you, as is aforesaid, whereof you the said Chancellor to be one, shall cause to be put and fixed a Seal, engraven with the Rose and Crown, and the Letter J. and Figure 2. before, and the Letter R. after the same with a Ring, or Circumfe∣rence about the same Seal, containing as followeth; Sigillum Commissiariorum Regiae Majestatis ad Causas Ecclesiasticas. Fi∣nally, We Will and Command all, and singular other our Mi∣nisters and Subjects, in all and every Place and Places, exempt, and not exempt within our Realm of England, and Domini∣on of Wales, upon any Knowledge, or Request from you, or any three, or more of you, as is aforesaid, to them, or any of them given or made, to be aiding, helping, and assisting unto you, and to your Commandment, in, and for the due executing your Precepts, Letters, and other Processes requi∣site in, and for the due Executing of this Our Commissi∣on, as they, and every of them, tender Our Pleasure and Will, to answer the Contrary at their utmost Perils. In wit∣ness, &c. Its not so easie, perhaps, at first sight, to discern the Flaws and Deficiences included in this Commission, neither shall I rake further into it, only I'll observe with a Learned Gentle∣man: First, The Archbishop of Canterbury, who was first na∣med in it, refused to Act, so that the Bishop of Chester was put in, though not in the first Place: Secondly, How unwarily it was it drawn, for, though it was to be thought, every one
understood the Design of the Commission was to introduce a Roman Hierarchy, which assumes a Power over the Temporal, in order to the Spiritual Good, yet that Commission, granted the Temporal Power, viz. The Lord Chancellor, and any other two, viz. Lord Treasurer, President, or Lord Chief Justice, a Power of Excommunication, which is a pure Spiritual Act. This Commission thus granted and opened, the first Light∣ning of it fell upon the Bishop of London, whose pretended Crime was, That by Virtue of the King's Letter, he did not suspend Dr. Sharp, then Dean of Norwich, now Archbishop of York, for Preaching a Sermon in his Parish-Church of St. Giles, against the Frauds and Corruptions of the Church of Rome, by a Power as Arbitrary as that by which the Commissioners act∣ed. But though the Romanists might be sufficiently incensed against the Bishop for his Non-compliance herein, the King had another Cause of Offence with his Lordship; for, when the Lords in the last Parliament had Voted an Address of Thanks to the King, as I have already noted, for his Speech, the Bishop moved in his own and his Brethren's Name, that the House might debate the King's Speech, which, as it was extraordinary and unusual in the House, so it was no less sur∣prizing to the King and Court, who now dreaded the Lords would concur with the Commons in their Address, and con∣strued this Pace to be a Piece of Presumption in the Bishop, for which, in due time, he should be sure to be remembred; and so, indeed, it happened: For notwithstanding the Bishops just Plea before the Commissioners in his own Defence, and that Jefferies, the Mouth of them, had in a manner nothing else to say, but, Must not the King be obeyed? Must not the King be obeyed? As if a Man was bound to hang himself, if the King commanded it, yet they suspended him ab Officio, where we leave him at present, and proceed to shew you the further Effects of this goodly Commission,Dr. Hough chosen Pre∣sident of Magdalen Collede. when there was the least Opportunity to put it in Execution. You must know, the Presidentship of Magdalen College in Oxford falling vacant about this time, and the Fellows, fearing a Mandamus would be imposed upon them, for some Person or other not qualified by their Statutes, and whom by their Oaths they could not submit to, chose Dr. Hough, a Person every way qualified for their President; which was no sooner done, but the King sent them a Peremptory Mandamus, to make choice of the Bishop of Oxford for their President, who, as being not qualified by their Statutes, they rejected, and in an humble An∣swer, excused themselves, as being otherwise obliged, as well by their Oaths as Statutes, with which the King was so Angry, and used such Expressions upon the Occasion, as were never, perhaps, before used by a Prince. But finding his harsh Lan∣guage
could not frighten the Fellows out of their Duty, he sent his Commissioners of Ecclesiastical Affairs among them, to turn them out of their Fellowships,The Fellows of Magda∣len College turn'd out. to which they had as much Right as any other Man to his Estate. But the good Commissioners were so far from boggling at this, that they yet went further, and by a new strain of Tyranny, never practi∣sed but by Absolute Tyrants, made the Fellows uncapable of any other Ecclesiastical Preferments, and a Seminary of Jesuits and Popish Priests were introduced into their rooms, as much to the Subvertion of the Established Church, as the Statutes of the College. While Things were thus carried on with an high Hand, by Virtue of this extraordinary Commission, you cannot think they were more moderate in the Administration of ordinary Justice in the Westminster Courts; you know how severely Oats was treated for discovering the Popish Plot.Dangerfield Sentenced and kill'd. Now comes Thomas Dangerfield's Turn, for his discovering of the Meal-Tub-Plot, but with a worse-Fate; For this Man having in King Charles his Time, in his Depositions before the Parliament, reveal∣ed, that he was imploy'd by the Popish Party, and chiefly by the Lords in the Tower, and the Countess of Powis, to kill the King, and that he was incouraged, and promised Impunity and Reward, and part of it given him by the D. of York for that End, he was now prosecuted upon a Scandalum Magnatum, and as Juries went, found guilty, and had the same Sentence of Whipping with Oats: But in his return from Tyburn towards Newgate after his Whipping, he was run into the Eye with a Tuck at the end of a Cane, by one Robert Francis, a Red-hot Papist, of which, with the Agony of the Whipping, he soon after died: But his Body was so swoln and martyred with his Whipping, that it was a Question whether he died of that, or of the Wound in his Eye, for which Francis however was justly Hanged, the King thinking it would appear to be too base a Partiality to pardon him for so foul a Fact. Much about the same time,Mr. John∣son's Sen∣tence. Mr. Sam. Johnson, commonly known by the Name of Julian Johnson, because of his being the Au∣thor of a Book so called, was Sentenced by the Court of King's Bench, Sir Edward Herbert being Lord Chief Justice, to stand 3 times in the Pillory, and to be Whipped from Newgate to Tyburn, which was severely Executed, without any regard to his Gown, he being a Clergy-man, for making this humble and hearty Address to all the English Protestants in the Army which the King had raised.
GENTLEMEN, NExt to the Duty which we owe to God, which ought to be the principal Care of Men of your Profession, espe∣cially (because you carry your Lives in your Hands, and often look Death in the Face;) the second Thing that deserves your Consideration, is the Service of your Native Country, wherein you drew the first Breath, and breathed a free Eng∣lish Air: Now I would desire you to consider, how well you comply with these Two main Points, by engaging in this present Service. Is it in the Name of God, and for his Service that you have joined your selves with Papists, which will, indeed, fight for the Mass-book, but burn the Bible, and who seek to ex∣tirpate the Protestant Religion with your Swords, because they cannot do it with their own, and will you be aiding and assisting to set up Mass-houses, to erect the Popish Kingdom of Darkness and Desolation amongst us, and to train up all our Children in Popery? How can you do these Things, and yet call your selves Protestants? And then what Service can be done your Country, by be∣ing under the Command of French and Irish Papists, and by bringing the Nation under a Foreign Yoak? Will you help them to make a forcible Entry into the Houses of your Coun∣try-men, under the Name of Quartering, directly contrary to Magna Charta, and the Petition of Right? Will you be aiding and assisting to all the Murders and Outrages which they shall commit by their void Commissions, which were de∣clared illegal and sufficiently blasted by both Houses of Parlia∣ment, (if there had been any need of it) for it was very well known before, that a Papist cannot have a Commission, but by the Law is utterly disabled and disarmed? Will you ex∣change your Birth-right of English Laws and Liberty for Martial or Club-Law; and help to destroy one another, on∣ly to be eaten last your selves? If I know you well, as ye are English Men, you hate and scorn these Things; and therefore be not unequally yoaked with Idolatrous and Bloody Papists. Be valiant for the Truth, and shew your selves Men. The same Considerations are likewise humbly offered to all the English Sea-men, who have been the Bulwark of this Nation against Popery and Slavery, ever since 1588.
This Address is so plain, as to need no Remark upon it; and therefore,K. James's Letter to the Scotch Parliament. I shall only tell you, before I pass to Foreign Affairs, that Colonel Talbot, formerly mentioned, was doing what he would all this time in Ireland, while the King him∣self had settled Affairs so in Scotland, when he was High Com∣missioner, (and now Argyle was cut off) that he did not que∣stion but to carry on his Designs more bare-faced there, than he had done in England: And therefore, tho' he did not call a Parliament in that Kingdom till April, this Year, yet, in his Letter to them, he took no notice at all of the Protestant Dissenters, but recommended to them his innocent Roman Catholick Subjects, who had, with their Lives and Fortunes, been always assistant to the Crown in the worst Rebellions and Usurpations, though they lay under Discouragements hardly to be named. These he heartily recommended to their Care, to the End, that as they had given good Experience of their true Loyalty, and peaceable Behaviour, so, by their Assistance, they might have the Protection of his Laws, and that Security under his Government which others of his Subjects had, not suffering them to lie under Obligations, which their Religion could not admit of; by doing whereof, they would give a De∣monstration of the Duty and Affection they had to him, and do him most acceptable Service: And this Love he expected they would shew to their Brethren, as they saw he was an in∣dulgent Father to them all. This was very kind, indeed, on the King's part, to those of his own Religion; and in this kind Mood we will leave him at present, and prosecute a little the mighty Affairs of the Campaigns abroad, where their Ar∣mies were doing much better Feats than ours in England, whose greatest Talent was Cursing and Swearing, and Riding the Country as themselves pleased. I shall make no Recapitulation in this Place of the Progress of the last Campaign in Hungary,Buda be∣sieged. nor of the Siege of Buda, with the ill Success of it, the preceding Year, viz. 1684, but come to tell you, That the Duke of Lorain having joined the Imperial Army in June, marched now again towards Buda, and by the 21st in the Morning, the Imperialists began their Approaches at about 500 Yards distance from the Walls of the Lower Buda, making use upon this Occasion, of their old Trenches, and continued their Works all that Day, and the following Night, tho' with considerable Difficulty from the Badness of the Earth, and the Enemies firing out of the Town, from whence a Pole, taken at the Siege of Vienna, made his Escape with the Basha's Horse, 2 Scymiters, and his Command∣ing-Staff, who reported to the General; That their coming before Buda was very surprizing, that the Garrison was not near so strong as when it was besieged before; and that the Turks
had Intelligence, that the Christians had formed a Design up∣on Alba Regalis and Erla; which was true in Fact; for it was not concluded to attempt Buda till the 20th of June, at a ge∣neral Council of War hold at Comorra. And 2 Days after the Pole, came a Janizary out of the Town also, and surrender'd himself, upon a Dream he had had the Night before, that the Christians would become Masters of the Place, and put all the Sword, as they had done last Year at Neuheusel; and that if he fled to the Christians, he might find Merty: Adding withal, that the Garrison was not above 6000 strong. This Intelli∣gence made the Germans re-double their Diligence; so that the same Day, with a Battery of 6 Pieces of Cannon, which they had raised, they made a Breach in the Wall of the Low∣er Town, (which was 5 Foot thick,) of about 15 Paces; which made the Turks fear an Assault that very Night, and they prepared for it accordingly, but it was deferred till the Day following; when, after the Basha's Women, and about 10000 Pounds in Money, had been taken as going by Water, from the Town to Belgrade, there were a Party of Granadeers com∣manded to discover whether the Breach were accessible, or not; which, upon their Report of its being so, was stormed at Night, with such Confusion, that if the Turks had kept their Posts, they might have cut off all the Assailants: But they were so far from that, that they not only retired into the Up∣per Town, and by their Proceedings, did not think themselves secure there neither, for they made a Fire against the New Port, that they might see if the Germans attempted any thing by Petard. This the Germans did not do, but only contented themselves to make a Lodgment upon the Breach. From the 25th to the 29th, the Besiegers were (busie in raising more Batteries, and making a Line of Communication between the Lodgment and the Angle of the Wall looking into St. Paul's Valley; which they finished, and placed 4 Mortars there, not∣withstanding, the Turks, in 2 several brisk Sallies, endeavoured to hinder them, and in their continual firing from the Town all manner of destructive Instruments upon them; yet this did not hinder the Besiegers by the 1st of July, to raise a Battery to fire upon the Angle of the Round Tower, which looks to∣wards St. Paul's Valley, and to carry on their Trenches, by the Help of that and another Battery, so as to take in a Turkish Mosque; from whence they returned with an Angle and Parallel Line with Buda, till they came to the Right-hand Way lead∣ing to the North Part, at which the 3 Lines met, by the Fa∣vour of a Wall and a deep Road, under which the Besiegers were covered, who now mounted 4 Mortars more, with which they continually played upon the Town. Their Cannon also by this time, had made a considerable Breach, which, by their advancing another Line from the Place where the 3 Lines
met, so as to flank the outermost of them, and join the Wall of the old Town looking into St. Paul's Valley, (where they made a Place of Arms capable to hold about 300 Men,) they now, by the 4th, were got within 50 Paces of it, where they covered themselves from the Enemies Fire. The Branden∣burghers the same Day arriving in the Camp, they took up their Quarters to the Left of the Germans, and advanced 2 Pa∣rallel Lines, to communicate with the others by the next Morning. The Town in the mean time was set on fire the Night before, and a great part of it burnt down before the Fire could be quenched; which yet did not apparently discou∣rage the Turks, who on the 9th made a great Sally, and did considerable Damage to the Besiegers; but they were at last repulsed: And tho' on the 13th the Duke commanded a Lodgment to be made on the Breach, yet the Enemy stood so bravely to it, that it could not be effected; and the Besiegers in that Attack, lost near 1000 Soldiers, besides Officers, and 50 Voluntiers, whereof were several Noblemen, and, among others, divers English Men of Quality. However, they con∣tinued the Siege obstinately, and made a considerable Progress therein by the 22th, when the Turks sallied out upon the Ba∣varian Quarter, and did considerable Execution, nailing up a Battery of Cannon and 2 Mortars, and then retired with little Loss: But about an Hour after, the Enemies principal Maga∣zine blew up, which stood near the Castle that looks towards Pest, by which a great part of the Wall was demolished; which, upon the viewing of it, seemed so great to many of the Generals, that they were for storming the Place, without de∣lay. This the Duke of Lorain did not think yet practicable, but sent next Day a threatning Summons to the Governour to surrender; who answered, in short, That he thought His Highness would justifie him, that he had hitherto done like a brave Man; and that he was resolved to continue so doing, and that God punisheth the Vain-glorious. Hereupon the Duke ordered a ge∣neral Assault to be made on the 27th; and, after much Bra∣very, and obstinate fighting on each side, the Germans fixed their Lodgment upon the first Wall, and prepared their fur∣ther Approaches: On the 30th they sent another Summons to surrender; which was answered the Day following, in a Letter to the General, wherein the Besieged let him know, That the Town was in the Hands of GOD, and that they could not give it up; but if they would receive another Place in lieu of it, they would treat thereupon. The Duke not satisfied herewith, order∣ed 2 Mines to be sprung under the second Wall, but they had not the desired Success: However, that Evening the Enemy sent two Messengers to the Elector of Bavaria, who thereup∣on sent them 2 Hostages, and the firing ceased on both sides; The Basha proposing to surrender the Town, if they
would conclude a Peace upon it, which he said he had Power to do: But the Elector answering, That he had no such Com∣mission, but that he would do what Service he could towards the furthering of one; the Firing was renewed. On the 3d of Aug. the Besiegers made a general Assault up∣on the second Wall, but came off with considerable Loss; and they were also allarmed about this time with the Noise of the Turkish Succours that were marching up; which, indeed, pro∣ved a Reality, and that before the Christians made any consi∣derable Progress more in the Siege, tho' they attempted ano∣ther general Assault on the 12th; For, the very next Day, to∣wards Evening, the Duke of Lorain received certain Intelli∣gence, that the Enemy, to the Number of 90000 Men, ad∣vanced towards his Camp, with a resolute Design to force one of his Quarters, and to put Succours into the Town. Here∣upon,The Battel of Buda. in Concert with the Elector of Bavaria, he caused all the Horse and Foot to march out of the Lines, except 20000 Men that were left to continue the Attacks, and guard the several Posts and Avenues of the Camp, and drew up the Army in or∣der of Battel. Next Day, being the 14th of Aug. he being informed, that the Grand Visier had detached from his Army a Body of 6000 Janizaries, and 4000 Spahi's, all chosen Men, who descending from the Hills, to the Plain, which separated his Camp from the Germans, had passed it without Oppositi∣on, and gained the Hills which commanded the Imperialists Lines on the Right; and perceiving the Grand Visier's De∣sign was to force a Passage into the Town that way, while himself drew up his Army in the Plain to attack the Christi∣ans Left Wing, or in case they failed therein, to retrench themselves upon the Hills, and from thence to incommode the German Camp with their Cannon; He kept the main Body of his Troops to oppose those of the Grand Visier, and about 7 Regiments of Horse, with some few Hungarians, to make head against the Detachment upon the Hills, who entertained the Christians with several Vollies of their Cannon; and the Ja∣nizaries made so furious a Fire upon them, that the Hunga∣rians and Croats, who had the Van-guard, fell into disorder. Upon this, the Regiment of Taffe advancing, came timely to their Assistance, and, with the Help of the other Horse, for∣ced the Enemy-headlong down the Hill, with so great Fury and Slaughter, that near 3000 of the Janizaries were slain up∣on the Spot; and the rest chose rather to retire towards the Bridge of Esseck, than re-join their main Army. The Ger∣mans brought back with them 8 Pieces of Cannon, about 30 Colours and Standards, with near 300 Prisoners, and, perhaps, a more vigorous Action was never performed by Horse alone, with those Disadvantages of Ground and Number. Having thus regained their first Post, and shortned their Pursuit of the
Enemy, for that they did not know but that the main Body were engaged, the Hills separating them from the Sight of what passed on the Left. They found the Grand Visier had drawn up his whole Army in the Plain, to which the Duke of Lorain opposed his, but that they both stood at a respectful Distance from one another: However now, after this victori∣ous little Body of Horse had rejoined the Right Wing of the Christians, the Turks began to make several Motions, which shewed more their Uneasiness and Irresolution, than any De∣sign they had to attack the Christians; and, having by degrees withdrawn all their Infantry to the Foot of their own Hills, the Right Wing of the Imperialists received Orders to ad∣vance towards some Bodies of Horse that approached to them: But proportionably, as the Germans advanced, the others withdrew, till finding themselves at the Foot of the Hill, and seeing that the Christians Right Wing had by much out-march∣ed the rest of the Army, they charged a small Body of Hun∣garians on the Left, who yielding before them, had like to have laid open the German Flank, and wrought some Disor∣der; Yet by the Firmness of the German Troops, and Conduct of their Officers, who immediately fronted some Squadrons that way, and covered their Flank, the Turks retired; the Christians at the same time, it being already late, having Or∣ders to withdraw, and return into their Lines, which they did accordingly: The Grand Visier also moved towards Alba Re∣galis; and he ordered the Basha, who brought him the News of the said Defeat, to be strangled, for saying, That they char∣ged the Christians like Lions, but that they received them again like Devils. But to return again to the Siege:The Siege continued. On the 16th it was car∣ried on with great Vigour; and at the Duke of Lorain's At∣tack, the Pallisadoes with which the Enemy had secured the Breach were burnt, but the Night following they set up new ones again, and made other Works to defend the Breach; while the Germans and Bavarians continued their Mines, Bat∣teries, and other Preparations, at their respective Attacks, for a general Assault: So that on the 19th, all Things were again ready for a Storm; but the 2 Mines which the Christians sprang, not throwing down the Enemies Pallisadoes, as was expected, they did not then go on with it, but raised a Battery of 4 Pieces of Cannon more, to play upon the Enemies Pallisadoes. Thus Things continued to the 20th, when about 6 in the Morning 3000 chosen Janizaries and Spahi's, each of which received 30 Crowns from the Grand Visier, to encourage them to that Service, fell upon the Christians Out-guards, and forced them and the Croats, who were posted in the Plain, to retire into the Camp; and, in the Confusion occasioned thereby, they
put about 150 Men into the Town, the rest being beaten back by the Troops which Count Caprara and General Heusser brought to the Assistance of the Croats. However, this Re∣inforcement was not so considerable, as either to daunt the Germans, or hearten the Turks much; tho' the latter persist∣ed still as obstinate in their Defence, as the other were reso∣lute to carry the Place before they left it a second time: To which end they continued on the 21st, to play with their Can∣non and Bombs from the 3 Attacks they had, and to fill the Ditches, with that Success, that on the Elector of Bavaria's side all Things were ready for an Assault. But the Besieged made a Sally upon them next Day, and beat them from some of their Works, which the Bavarians recovered soon after; and not only so, but cut off the Turks they found there: Not sa∣tisfied with that, on the 23d they made an Assault upon the Castle, the Detachment which was appointed for that Service, mounted the Breach, tho' defended by the Turks with great Obstinacy, whose Retrenchments they forced, and all their other Posts on that side, and remained absolute Masters of the Castle, most of the Turks that were posted there being killed, and the rest retired behind the Ruines of the Houses, from whence the Christians Cannon quickly chased them into the Town, which was only separated from the Castle by an old Wall, of no great Defence. This being happily effected, the Besiegers bestirred themselves in all Quarters, to put the finishing Stroke to the Work; and so much the more, because of the near Approach of the Ottoman Army again; and there∣fore, amongst other Things, on the 27th they laid a Boom cross the River, with Beams, to prevent any Body's swimming into the Town, tho' none of the Enemy appeared, either that or the next Day; But on the 29th, by Break of Day, a Party of about 3000 Janizaries on Horse-back advanced along the side of the Danube, by the Hot Baths, with a Design to throw themselves into the Place, by the Way of the Lower Town; to which Purpose, they brought along with them some En∣gines, like Ladders, made with Boards, which they applied to the Wall, and about 6 Turks passed, who were cut off by those on the inside. There were about 400 of them, who rid along the Wall of the Lower Town, till they got to St. Paul's Val∣ley, receiving the Fire of the Christians Lines, which was there doubled upon them; and a little further they met with a Squadron of Horse, who cut them all off, save 4 or 5 that got into the Town: And, indeed, they were so confounded with the Christians Lines and Redoubts, that they knew not which way to turn themselves, so that they came off with ve∣ry considerable Loss. Yet this Miscarriage did not totally dis∣courage the Grand Visier, who on the 30th of Aug. attempt∣ed
by 3 several Ways, to put in Succours; but the Troops appointed for that Service, were repulsed by those which were set for the Guard of the Imperial Lines, with the Loss of 500 Men; Tho' to favour the Design, the Grand Visier had at the same time drawn up his Army in the Plain, making a Shew, as if he would attack the Christians, but went no farther: So that the latter proceeded with all imaginable Application to fill up the second Ditch, and to put every Thing in a Readiness for a general Assault; to which they were the more encouraged, by the Additional Re-inforcement they received on the 1st of Sept. of near 10000 Men, under the Command of the Count de Scherffenberg; whereof, 2000 of them mounted the advan∣ced Posts at the Duke of Lorain's Attack the same Day. At last the Second of Sept. came, when all Things being now ready, it was unanimously resolved in a Council of War to storm the Town; which was done in the following Man∣ner. They begun and continued from all their Batteries to play upon the Breaches,Buda storm∣ed. and the Flanks of the Enemies Retrench∣ments with Chain-shot, and at the same time, threw a great many Bombs and Carcasses into the Town; and, to amuse the Turks, the Christian Troops made several Movements, as if they designed to fight the Grand Visier; and part of those that guarded the Works towards the Town, were, in the Enemies ight, drawn from thence towards the Lines, while double their Number were detach'd, by cover'd Ways, to supply their Places. About 3 in the Afternoon the Pallisadoes that secured the Breaches being beaten down, by the Besiegers Cannon, 3000 Men, di∣vided into several Detachments, and supported by a like Num∣ber, made the Assault at the Duke of Lorain's Attack, being commanded by the Duke of Newburg, the Duke de Croy, Count Souhes, and the Count de Scherffenberg: At the Bava∣rian and Brandenburg Quarters 1500 Men were appointed in each to begin the Assault, being also seconded with a Reserve of the like Number; and 2000 were appointed to make two false Attacks. Things being thus ordered, the Detachments, as soon as the Signal was given, advanced and mounted the Breaches with as great Order as Courage; and the Besieged at the same time defended themselves with a Resolution equal to what they had shewn upon other Occasions; and with their Fougades, Bombs, Stones, Bags filled with Powder, Pikes, and other Arms, forced the Germans at the Duke of Lorain's At∣tack twice to retire: But these being supported by the Duke's Presence, who lead them on himself to the very Foot of the Breach,Buda taken. going up the 3d time, entred the Town▪ with the Slaughter of 800 Janizaries, that defended the Breach on that side, where the Visier Basha was himself, during the
whole Action, and gave incredible Proofs of his Bravery, and would by no means quit his Post, though he was wounded in the Right Arm, but taking his Sabre in his Left-Hand, con∣tinued still to encourage his Men, till he fell among the slain; which verified the Answer he first sent the Duke of Lorain upon his Summons to him to surrender, by telling the Mes∣senger, Go, tell your General, I'll meet him upon the Breach. The Brandenburghers entred the Town much the same time as the Imperialists did, and the Bavarians soon after; so that forcing the Enemy from their several Posts and Retrench∣ments, the Assailants advanced to the Market-place, and in an Hour's time were absolute Masters of the Place. But the Turks, after the Christians were entred the Town, sprung a Mine, and by the Means of a Train laid for that Purpose, set several Houses on fire, which continued burning till next Morning, and consumed abundance of rich Movables. How∣ever, the Soldiers found a great deal of Plate, Jewels, Mo∣ney, &c. insomuch, that many of them got 2 or 3000 l. a Man. It was computed, there was 5000 fighting Men in the Town at the time of the Assault, and that 3000 of them were slain in the first Heat and Fury of the Soldiers; but about 1500 of them retiring into a Redoubt on the side of the Castle, put out a White Flag, and begged for Quarter; which, after hold∣ing a Council of War, was, in Consideration of the approach∣ing Night, and the Confusion occasioned in the Town by the Fire, granted them: But the Vice-Basha, and the Aga of the Janizaries, with some others of Note, were taken Prisoners before this. Of the Christians there were about 500 slain, and not quite so many wounded; but the Number of Cannon and Mortars they found in the Town was very great, there being no less than 400 Pieces of Cannon in all, and of them 170 were fit for Service, but most of them dismounted; and there was also considerable Ammunition left still. But what made the Conquest of this important Place so very glorious, was, That it was obtained in the Sight of the whole Turkish Army, commanded by the Grand Visier in Person, who lay encamped within a Mile of Buda, and had possess'd himself of an Hill, from whence he pretended to incommode the Christians with his Cannon; yet, being observ'd narrowly by the brave Prince Lewis of Baden, who commanded upon this Occasion, he set fire to his Camp as soon as he heard the Town was taken, and retired towards Alba Regalis. It was reported by a Deserter, That the Basha of Buda had, 2 Days before the Place fell into the Hands of the Christians, written a very bold Letter to the Grand Visier, telling him, That for his own part, he had performed his Duty by a long and vigorous Defence; but, that the Grand Visier could not excuse himself, that he had so long
been in sight of the Place without Relieving it, which he could not but have done, had his Men had but as much Courage as the Women in the Town had, during the Siege. Things were no sooner set in order at Buda,Five Church∣es besieg'd. but the Army moved to Paxi, the Duke having sent Count Caraffa with a strong Detachment, to lay Siege to Segedin, and the Prince of Baden with another to take in Five Churches, of whose Ex∣pedition we shall first give a short Account, and then return to the other: The Prince having joined some of the Croatian Forces, did, on the 16th of Oct. after a very difficult March, arrive before Five Churches, the Turks at the same time setting fire to the Town, and retiring into the Castle; But the Im∣perial Dragoons presently scaling the Walls, threw themselves into the Place with their Sabres in their Hands, and opened the Gates to the other Troops, who immediately quenched the Fire, and intrenched themselves in the principal Posts, as far as the great Mosque, and the Night following advanced with∣in Musket-shot of the Castle, and began to raise Batteries. However, the Castle being an irregular Square, fortified with 4 Roundels, and some other Works, according to the Modern Fortification, and encompassed with Hills of very difficult Access, and having a Garrison of 2500 Men in it, commanded by a Basha and 7 Beys, made the Siege go on but slowly at first, and especially in that the Imperial Troops stood in great need of Forage. Yet, on the 18th and 19th the Besiegers batter∣ed the Place continually with their Cannon, and having made a Breach next Day, began 3 Mines; the Prince in the mean while sending threatning Summons to the Besieged to sur∣render, who returned no Answer that Day; but next Morn∣ing, by a Letter, desired that some Person might be sent to them. Hereupon, Hostages were exchanged, and the Treaty of Surrender was set on foot, which the Prince would allow upon no other Terms than at Discretion; and the other, wanting Ammunition,Surrender'd. were constrained to submit to; so that not only the Garrison, but the Inhabitants, which were many in Number, were made Prisoners of War. As soon as ever the Prince of Baden had put a good Garrison into Five Churches, he divided his Forces into 2 Bodies; with one of them himself marched towards Dard, and the Count de Sherffenberg advanced with the other to Syclos,The besie∣ging and ta∣king of Sy∣clos. and on the 25th of Oct. arrived before it. After he had sent his Summons to the Turks, who were retired into the Castle, and by their Answer appeared resolute to defend it, he began his Attack the next Day, and continued it till the last Day of the Month, with that Success, that his Mines being ready to be sprung, the Besieged surrender'd at Discretion, the Garrison being made Prisoners of War, and the Women and Children con∣ducted
to other Places. After this the Count marched to re∣join the Prince of Baden, marching as before, towards Darda: Upon whose Approach,Darda a∣bandon'd by the Turks. tho' there were 2 Basha's, with 3000 Horse posted there, to cover the Fortress, yet they retired in∣to Esseck, leaving only a small Body of Horse behind, to ob∣serve the Motions of the imperialists, who advanced directly towards Esseck,The Pr. of Baden burns the Bridge of Esseck. and with several Fire-works prepared for that Purpose, set the Bridge on fire; And notwithstanding the E∣nemy played upon them all the while with their Cannon from Esseck, yet they quite destroyed it, from Darda to the Drave, as likewise the Bridge of Boats which the Turks had over that River. After this the Prince marched back to Capsowar, which the Turks quickly surrender'd upon Articles, and were con∣ducted to Sigeth; the Prince, at the same time, now the Sea∣son was advanced, and the Weather grown very bad, putting his Troops into Winter-Quarters; where we will leave them, and return to Count Caraffa, who on the 5th of Oct. invested Segedin.Segedin be∣sieg'd. This Work was afterwards left to be carried on by General Wallis, or Welch, and English Man, (in the Absence of Count Caraffa,) who performed his Part very gallantly; and being reinforced with some Horse and Dragoons from the Duke of Lorain, under the Command of Major-General Vete∣rani, he pushed on the Siege with great Vigour, though the Garrison made a stout Resistance, and Provisions grew scarce in his Camp; To which, adding the other Difficulties that a∣rose from the Season, they began to render the Enterprize, af∣ter all, very hazardous. But the Care the Grand Visier took▪ occasioned, if not the Loss of the Place, yet, at least, the ha∣stening of it; for having detached 2000 Turks and 4000 Tar∣tars, to attempt the Relief of it, they advanced to a Place called Scinta, within 4 Hungarians Miles of General Wallis's Camp, and there expected a further Reinforcement, in order to proceed on their Design; which, together with the other fore-mentioned Inconveniencies, proving very uneasie to Ge∣neral Wallis, he called a Council of War; wherein it was re∣solved, that General Veterani should be sent with a Detach∣ment, to attack the Turks before their expected Reinforce∣ment came. In pursuance of this Resolution, Veterani, on the 19th at Night, marched with 10 Regiments, which made not together above 5000 Men all Night long, though it was very dark, and being got within a Mile and an half of the E∣nemy by the Light of the Fire they made, drew up in Battalia in 2 Lines; the first Commanded by Col. St. Croy, and the other by the Baron de Ghotz, and in this Order advanced to∣wards the Enemies Camp, hoping to surprize them at break of Day: But it happened, that through the Darkness of the Night, the Squadrons fell into some Disorder, and by the
Noise they made, gave the Alarm to the Tartars out-guard. However, the General continued his march with what Silence and Conduct he could, and at break of Day fell into the Tartars Quarters, while Col. Ghotz with 3 Regiments forced that of the Turks,The Battel of Scinta. of both which they made a great Slaughter, and took divers Prisoners, by whom they understood the Tartars were about 7000 strong: But the Enemy had no sooner aban∣doned their Camp, than that the German Soldiers fell to plun∣der it, notwithstanding the strict Orders given by the Gene∣rals to the Contrary, which the Turks and Tartars observing, they Rallied, and returning with great Fury, fell upon Gene∣ral Veterani, who was for the present forced to retreat, having with him but 3 Squadrons; and would have been in great Danger, had not Col. St. Croix hasted with his Regiment to his Assistance, being followed by Col. Castelli with 3 Regi∣ments more, that he had got together in great haste, which renewed the Fight with great sharpness. But at last the Ene∣my was routed and fled, yet were not much pursued, Vete∣rani thinking it enough to pillage their Camp now, and then to return to Segedin, which he was upon doing accordingly. However, in his march, perceiving a great Body of Horse up∣on his Left, he was much surprized at it, and thinking no other way of escape was left him, but to be Resolute, he immedi∣ately drew up his Troops in Battalia, and advanced towards the Turks, who were little less than 12000 strong, and all Horse, save 500 Janizaries, who guarded the Cannon, and who charged the Imperialists 5 several times, being incoura∣ged by the Presence of the Grand Visier, who was said to be amongst them, and which seemed afterward to be confirmed by the Baggage that was taken. But after an obstinate Fight of 2 Hours, the Turks and Tartars were entirely defeated, with the Slaughter of above 2000, and the Loss of all their Bag∣gage and Cannon, a great many fine Horses, 400 Mules, and 500 Camels laden with Ammunition and Provision, designed for the Relief of Segedin,Segedin sur∣render'd to the Impe∣rialists. the Surrender whereof was the Con∣sequence of this Signal Victory, which the Garrison did give up upon the 23d, though the Imperialists found it in a Condition to have supported a longer Siege, which was the more grateful to them, in that they found themselves not in a State much longer to continue it, with which, and the taking in some other defenceless Places, for the Enlargement of Winter-Quar∣ters, the Campaign also ended on that side, as well as in all Hungary, from whence we shall move how to the Affairs of Venice. The Venetians could not be so early in the Field this Year, but that the Turks were before-hand with them, who march'd with a Body of 10000 Foot and 3000 Horse betime in the
Spring to attack Chialafa, a Place taken from them but last Year, wherein there was now a Garrison of 1200 Men. After the Captain Basha had raised a Battery,Chialafa be∣sieged by the Turks. he summoned the Garrison, and offer'd good Conditions, but the Governour Seignior Spiritti sent him Answer, He was in so good a Posture as not to think of surrendring it; so that the Siege went on while Captain-General Morosini, upon advice from Seignior Cornaro, General of the Islands, who was Cruising in the Gulph of Coron, of what passed, sailed with the Fleet to Porto Vitulo, where arriving the 30th of March, there, after a Coun∣cil of War, he landed 3000 Men and 2000 Mainotes, in order to march to the Relief of the Besieged, to whom he gave No∣tice at the same time of his Intentions, and required them to favour the Enterprize by a Sally. These Troops advanced ac∣cordingly towards the Enemy,The Turks beaten and raise the Siege. and having attack'd in the Night a Post which the Turks had secured, at a little distance from their Camp, they easily possest themselves of it, intend∣ing next Morning by break of Day, to fall into their Camp also, but the Turks did not think fit to stay their coming, for they forthwith raised the Siege, and marched off before Day, yet did not escape so well, but that the Venetians pursued them, and overtaking their Cannon took it, having first cut off 500 Men that guarded it, with the Loss only of 10 on their side. After this the Captain-Ceneral sailed away for Zant, and being joyned by the Pope's Gallies with the Squadrons of Maltha and Tuscany, he sailed towards the End of May out of the Gulph of Lepanto, directing his Course towards Old Nava∣rino,Old Navari∣no besieged and taken. where he arrived the 2d of June, and landed part of the Army: And though the Enterprize appear'd to be very difficult, by reason of the Fortress, being situated upon a Rock, which was only accessible on one side, yet upon a severe Sum∣mons of shewing no Mercy to the Garrison, if they resisted, they gave up the Place the very next Day, leaving 20 Pieces of Brass Cannon, 23 of Iron, and 7 Mortars, to the Venetians, and their Liberty to 200 Christian Slaves. From hence Ge∣neral Coninsmark marched to New Navarino,New Navari∣no besieged. situated on a Rock of very difficult Access, and invested it as well as the Situation would permit, the Gallies and Galleots at the same time Battering and Bombing it with their Cannon and Mor∣tars from the Sea-ward: But being informed, that the Seras∣quier, with a Body of 10000 Turks, was marching to its Re∣lief; General Coninsmark, June 14, after leaving a sufficient Number of Troops to guard their Works, marched to meet him, and endeavoured 3 several times to engage them to a Battel, but could not; the Turks passing a River, and retiring to a very advantageous Ground. Upon this, the Forces which Count Coninsmark had with him, being reinforced with 14000
Men from on Board the Fleet, he resolved to pass the River in 2 places, and to attack the Enemy both in Front and Flank, which was performed accordingly. The Fight was obstinate, and the Success doubtful for 2 Hours, but at last the Turks fell into Confusion and fled, leaving near 1000 slain, and divers Prisoners behind them, with all their Tents, Cannon, and Bag∣gage, there being no more than 37 killed, and about 60 wound∣ed of the Christians. This good Success being attended with the blowing up of 150 of the Garrison of Navdrino,New Nava∣rino surren∣der'd. and among them their Basha, by a Quantity of Powder that took Fire from a Bomb, occasioned the Surrendry of the Place, of which the Christians took Possession, June 17, and found 63 Pieces of Cannon, and 13 Mortars, with a great Quantity of Ammuni∣tion therein. The Venetian Courage being thus heightned with a Train of Successes, nothing would serve turn now, but the Siege of Modon, a considerable Place in the Morea on the Southern Shoar,Modon be∣sieged by the Vene∣tians. which the Captain-General resolved upon, tho' he knew the Serasquier had reinforced the Garrison, and provided them with all Things necessary for their Defence, and having for that Purpose arrived June 22, before the Town, the Men landed the same Day under General Coninsmark, and the Place was invested the next, and Batteries raised against it, which plaid with good Success till the 27th, when another Battery of 7 Mortars was finished, and a Summons sent from the Captain-General to the commanding Basha to surrender, to which he appeared, yet stiff enough: So that the Siege went on, and by the 28th the Trenches were carried within 50 Paces of the Ditch, notwithstanding the continual Opposition made by the Enemy with their great and small Shot, who also on July the 1st, made a Sally, but were soon repulled; and the Besiegers proceeded vigorously on with their Work. At the same time they sent out Parties to discover what Posture the Serasquier was in, whom they were informed, had promi∣sed to bring the Turks Relief by the 6th, but they could learn no News of him; and on the 5th▪ they lodged themselves on the Counterscarp, and began to fill up the Ditch, there being already a great Breach made in the Wall, and all Things pre∣paring for an Assault: But, on the 6th it was prevented by the Inhabitants, who being terrified by the Execution of the Bombs,Surrendred. that had by this time laid a great part of the Town in Ashes, and the promised Succours not appearing, they obliged the Basha to Capitulate; and on the 7th, marched out to the Number of 3000 Men, leaving to the Venetians, both in the Castle and Town, near an 100 Pieces of Cannon of all sorts, and 13 Mortars, besides Ammunition and Provision, whereof there was a great Quantity.
The Season being still most proper for Action, and the Cap∣tain-General well knowing there was no way so well to height∣en the Glory of his Conquests,Napoli di Romania besieged. as to pursue them still, and that by such Methods as should be best for the further securing of them, he resolved to lay Siege to no less considerable a Place than Napoli di Romania, which was the Ancient Nauplia, situa∣ted upon the Eastern Shoar of the Morea, and having got all his Forces, both by Sea and Land, in a Readiness, he set sail from Modon, and July 13, was got before Clara, a Place about 6 Miles distant from Napoli di Romania, where he ordered the Forces to Land, and who the very next Day possessed themselves of the Hill Palameda, within Musket-shot of the Town, and began to attack the Place on that side: Yet they could not prevent the Serasquier, who lay with a Body of about 9000 Men not far off, to reinforce 2 Days after the Garrison with 300 Men, which consisted before of no less than 2000, under the Command of Mustapha Basha. But this the Serasquier be∣ing not content with, he advanced towards the Venetian Camp on the 6th, and General Coninsmark was so far from declining a Battel, that after having left Force sufficient to guard the Works about the Town, he marched about 2 Miles out of his Camp to meet him, and after some light Skirmishes, the 2 Bo∣dies engaged, but the Turks did not hold it long: For, having lost about 400 Men, they retired, and the General soon after went back to his Camp, and quickly possest himself of the Castles of Argos and Gemini, and in the mean time push'd on the Siege with all imaginable Vigour till the 19th, when the Serasquier having been reinforced with 3000 fresh Men, ap∣proached a second time towards the Venetian Camp, the Be∣sieged at the same time making a Sally upon the Venetians, who not only drove them furiously back into the Town, but they gave so warm an Entertainment to the Serasquier from the Cannon they had planted upon the Hill Palameda, that he was obliged to go off without making any Attempt upon their Lines. This gave the Christians an Opportunity to pursue the Siege, and on the 23d to lodge themselves in the Ditch of the Town and maintain their Post there; but they received Information the same Day, that the Serasquier having reinfor∣ced his Army to 12000 Men out of the Neighbouring Garri∣sons, intended to make a third Attempt to relieve the Place; whereupon several Detachments were ordered out to observe his March, between whom and the Enemy there happened di∣vers Skirmishes till the 29th, when the Serasquier advanced again to attack their Lines; the Besieged at the same time making a Sally with 1500 Men. The Enemies greatest Fury fell upon the Quarter of the Sclavonians, who being over powered by their Number, were forced to give way; but Ge∣neral
Coninsmark coming opportunely to their Assistance with a Detachment, rallied them again, and beat back the Turks. At the same time the Captain-General advanced to the Hill with 3500 Men,The Turks defeated. which he had caused to land out of the Ships and Gallies, who charged the Mahometans with that Resolution and Bra∣very, both in Front and Flank, that they obliged them to re∣tire in great Confusion, and in the Action lost 1500 of their best Men, besides 120 that were taken Prisoners; the Veneti∣ans on their part coming off with about 400 killed and wound∣ed. This Success could not be more glorious to the Veneti∣ans, than it was discouraging to the Basha of the beleagured Town, who seeing now there was no hopes of Relief, that the Breach the Christians Cannon and Mines had made in the Walls of the Town, were such, that there was little appea∣rance of their being able to withstand a general Assault, and that besides the Garrison was in great want of Water, he hung out a White Flag, and the same Day the Capitulation was agreed on, which was the same in Substance with what had been granted to the Garrisons of Navarino and Modon; the Basha being refused to take with him 500 Slaves, which be∣longed to the 2 Gallies that had been disarmed in the begin∣ning of the Siege, and to have the Jews included in the Ca∣pitulation, on both which he so much insisted.Napoli di Romania taken. But what Joy soever might be exprest at Venice, for this Conquest, and their baffling rather than beating of the Turks at Sea, the Army in the main had no great Occasion for it, having lost abundance of Men by the Flux, and other Distempers reigning in the Camp, caused as was thought, by the great Heats, and eating of Fruits, but it proved to be at last a Sickness, that seemed to be the Effect of above than ordinary Cause, which put an End to the Campaign on that side, but it did not do so in Dalmatia. It cannot be expected I should treat of every Minute's Acti∣on, and Circumstance of this War in such an History and Com∣pass as this is; and therefore, to pass over them little Skir∣mishes and Rencounters which happen'd between the Turks and Christians that way, I shall content my self to recount the Particulars of the Siege and Taking of Sign, and the interve∣ning Circumstances thereof. Seignior Cornaro, Proveditor-Ge∣neral of that Country, and the Prince of Parma, having drawn together near Scalona 1000 Horse, and 3000 Foot of regular Troops, and 5000 Morlaques, commanded by the Chevalier Janco, with the Artillery and Ammunition necessary for a Siege, held a Council of War, wherein it was unanmously re∣solved to attack Sign;Sign be∣sieged. before which, after a very difficult March, they arrived Sept. 23, and found it not only situate on a Rock, but fortified with a good Wall, and a strong Castle.
However, they broke Ground before it the same Day, and raised 2 Batteries of 2 Pieces of Cannon, and one Mortar each, with which, by the 25th, they began to batter both Town and Castle, and in a few Hours dismounted the Enemies Can∣non that were planted on the great Roundel. The Provedi∣tor-General in the mean time sent the Governour a Sum∣mons, offering the same Conditions as had been granted to Navarino and Modon: But the Commandant, who was a Dalmatian Runagado, answered, He would defend the Place to the last, and would lose his Life with what the Grand Sig∣nior had intrusted in his Hands; adding, That he expected speedy Relief from the Basha of Arcegovina, who was within 12 Hours march of the Place. Upon this, the Besiegers be∣gan to fire again from their Cannon and Mortars, which they continued till the 26th; when finding the Breaches were large enough, and that the Pallisadoes, and other Defences the E∣nemy had made behind them were beaten down, the Prince of Parma appointed 500 Foot, under the Command of the Marquess de Borri, accompanied by divers Voluntiers, and sup∣ported by a Reserve of 400 Men, to make an Assault; upon whose approach, the Turks put themselves into a Posture of Defence, and with Granadoes and Stones withstood the Efforts of the Assailants for 3 Hours and upwards: But these at last prevailed, and gained the Breach; which made the Enemy re∣tire into their second Entrenchment and the Castle, where they put up a White Flag, which the Commandant pulled down with his own Hand.Sign taken. yet, this did not at all daunt the Assai∣lants, who pushing on to the second Retrenchment, took both it and the Castle, and cut in pieces all the Garrison, sparing only some few Women and Children; which Slaughter, all the Endeavours of the Marquess de Borri could not prevent, be∣cause the Chevalier Janco, to revenge the Death of some of his Relations, killed in the Assault, would give no Quarter. The Venetians found 8 Pieces of Cannon, and a considerable Number of other Arms, as also great many Mules in the Place; together with a very good Magazine of Powder. But, tho' the Plunder was inconsiderable to the Soldiery, the Turks having before the Siege removed their best Effects to other Places, yet the Town was of very great Consequence to the Republick, since they became thereby Masters of the fertile Province of Zettina. Now we have done with the Venetian Affairs, it may be ex∣pected we should say something of Poland, where the last Year was passed without any thing memorable; but the King himself taking the Field, it will be expected there should be something of Action, especially, seeing he had now conclu∣ded an Alliance offensive and defensive with the Two Czars
of Muscovy. He joined the Army in July, and marched at the Head of them towards Moldavia, erecting Forts in divers Places,The King of Poland in∣vades Mol∣davia. as he advanced to secure his Convoys and Retreat; which, together with the Difficulty of the Ways and Desart Countries throngh which they passed, made it the middle of Aug. before they could get into the Neighbourhood of Jassi, the Capital City of Moldavia; whither the Hospodar of Mol∣davia sent Deputies to him to excuse his retiring from Jassi,The Hospo∣dar's Mes∣sage to him, and his An∣swer. and his not joining his Forces with those of his Majesty, see∣ing he could not now openly declare himself, without expo∣sing his Children, whom he had been forced to give as Ho∣stages to the Turks, to certain Destruction. To whom the King made Answer, That the Hospodar could never meet with a more favourable Conjuncture to cast off the Ottoman Yoak, he being come in Person to free him from it: That he ex∣pected the Performance of his repeated Promises; and that if he did now manifest the Sincerity of the them, he would treat him as his declared Enemy. But this would not do, with the Hospodar, who continued firm to the Ottoman and Tartarian Interest during this whole Expedition; which was a great Disappointment to the King, who would not yet be discoura∣ged, but continued his Mach on this side the River Pruth, and on the 26th of Aug. encamped at a Place called Falsun; But the Court-Marshal, who commanded the Van-guard of the Army, was engaged the Day before with 8000 Tartars for near 2 Hours together, the latter having at first the Advan∣tage, who pressed very hard upon the Poles; Yet these being seconded by some fresh Troops, repulsed the others, and put them to flight, with the Loss of 800 of their Men slain, many Prisoners, and one of the Cham's own Standards. They had divers other small Rencounters from time to time, which yet did not hinder the King's advancing to Falxin, with an Inten∣tion to continue his March to Budziack; but being informed he must pass over several great Mountains, and that the Towns and Villages were burnt, and the Forage destroyed by the Tar∣tars, he held a Council of War, where it was resolved, that for the better Subsistance of the Troops, the Army should pass the River Pruth, the Country not being yet ruined on the o∣ther side; which was done accordingly: But upon Advice, that the Tartars had likewise passed that River, and burnt and ruined all the Country, and destroyed all the Springs of Wa∣ter, it was resolved to march towards Jassi; which they did in 6 Days time, having the Enemy continually in sight of them on the other side of the River, commanded by the Serasquier and Sultan Nuradin, and Cannonaded one another several times: However, the Polish Army got safe to their Camp, near Jassi, but the Turks, Tartars, and Hospodar's Men had no Design
they should continue long so, for they kept the Troops in a perpetual Alarm, and frequently cut off the King's Foragers, which greatly perplexed him. So that understanding at last, that the main Body of the Tartars, commanded by Sultan Nu∣radin, was come near his Camp, yet without being able pre∣cisely to learn the Place where they were, he caused it to be published among the Moldavians, That whoever brought him cer∣tain Intelligence of them, should have the Reward of 200 Crowns. Whereupon, one that was well acquainted with the Country, went into the Enemies Camp, and having observed it, re∣turned, and gave the King an Account, that they lay within a Mile of his Army, and that a Party of 4000 Tartars was ad∣vanced at some distance from the rest. The King being thus informed of the Posture the Enemy were in, detached the Court-Marshal and the Court-Treasurer about Midnight, to attack those advanced Troops, and followed himself with the whole Army. This Detachment, with the Help of the Mol∣davian, who was their Guide, came upon the Enemy before they had time to retire to their main Body, and, after a sharp Dispute, entirely routed them, taking about 300 Prisoners, among whom were several Murza's, and other Persons of con∣siderable Note among the Tartars.The King of Poland routs the Turks and Tartars. While this was doing, the King also advanced, and attacked the Serasquier and Sul∣tan; who not knowing of the Defeat of their advanced Troops, expected they would have fallen upon the Poles in their Rear and Flank; and with this Encouragement, they put themselves into a Posture to oppose him. However, they were deceived, and, after a short fight, were routed, and forced to flee, leaving a great many Slain and Prisoners behind them; but not with∣out Loss also on the Poles side, there being several Officers and Persons of Quality, and particularly the Palatine Podolskie, among the Number of the Slain. But while these Things were doing by the Polish Army abroad, the Country nearer Home was cruelly ravaged by the Garrison of Caminiec, who made frequent Incursions into the Polish Territories: Which, together with the King's marching homeward after this last Action, and demolishing the fore-mentioned Forts in his Re∣turn, which he had raised as he went onwards, made this Ex∣pedition to be little thought of; and as little Advantage to redound to the Poles from it, as they hitherto had reaped by their Alliance with the Moscovites, who made a mighty Smoak this Campaign, but very little Fire; of whom we shall have more Occasion to talk hereafter.
Now we are come to another Year; and the Affairs of Eng∣land fall of Course under our Consideration: And as we left off with taking Notice of the King's Kindness to his Roman Catholick Subjects in a more particular Manner,A Procla∣mation for a Tolerati∣on of Reli∣gion in Scot∣land. in the Letter he wrote to the Parliament of Scotland, we are now to tell you of a more general Act of his, and that was, upon the 12th of February to issue out his Proclamation for a Tolera∣tion of Religion unto all: Wherein, by the by, you are to ob∣serve, that he exerted his Absolute Power, which, he said, his Subjects ought to obey, without Reserve. But the Tolerati∣on he allowed his Roman Catholick Subjects in Scotland, he would scarce allow to his Protestant Subjects in Ireland; for Tyrconnel (so did Talbot merit for reforming the Army) was not only made an Earl,Tyrconnel made Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland▪ and other Proceedings there. but Lord-Lieutenant in Ireland to boot, in the room of my Lord Clarendon; and one Fitton, an infamous Person, detected for Forgery, not only at Westminster, but Chester too, was brought out of the King's-Bench Prison in England, to be Chancellor and Keeper of the King's Con∣science in Ireland, Sir Charles Porter being turned out to make way for him. Now Talbot, being thus advanced in Honour and Office, began to exert his Authority; and his first Pro∣clamation towards the End of Feb. imported a Promise to defend the Laws, Liberty, and Established Religion, but fairly left out the Preservation of the Act of Settlement and Explanation. However, though at first he only left them out, being resolved to out the Protestants first, and to let the Irish into their Forfeited Estates; yet he did not stop there. We told you last Year what Efforts were made to propa∣gate the King's Power in Westminster-Hall, and what Instructi∣ons the Judges had in their Circuits to dispense with the Penal Laws and Tests against Dissenters from the Church; and now these Things being brought pretty well to bear, up∣on the 25th of April out came the King's Declaration for Li∣berty of Conscience, which was conceived in the following Terms.
His MAJEETY's Gracious DECLARATION to all His Loving Subjects, for LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE. JAMES R. IT having pleased Almighty God not only to bring Us to the Imperial Crown of these Kingdoms, through the greatest Difficulties, but to preserve Us by a more than ordinary Pro∣vidence upon the Throne of Our Royal Ancestors; there is nothing now that We so earnestly desire, as to Establish our Government on such a Foundation, as may make Our Sub∣jects happy, and unite them to Us by Inclination as well as Duty; which We think can be done by no Means so effectu∣ally, as by granting to them the free Exercise of their Reli∣gion for the Time to come, and add that to the perfect En∣joyment of their Property, which has never been in any Case invaded by Us since Our coming to the Crown: Which be∣ing the Two Things Men value most, shall ever be preser∣ved in these Kingdoms, during our Reign over them, as the truest Methods of their Peace and Our Glory. We cannot but heartily wish, as it will easily be believed, that all Peo∣ple of Our Dominions were Members of the Catholick Church, yet We humbly thank Almighty God, it is, and hath of long time been Our constant Sense and Opinion (which upon divers Occasions We have declared) that Con∣science ought not to be constrained, nor People forced in Matters of meer Religion: It has ever been directly con∣trary to Our Inclination, as We think it is to the Interest of Government, which it destroys by spoiling Trade, depopu∣lating Countries, and discouraging Strangers; and finally, that it never obtained the End for which it was employed: And in this We are the more Confirmed by the Reflections We have made upon the Conduct of the Four last Reigns. For, after all the frequent and pressing Endeavours that were used in each of them, to reduce this Kingdom to an exact Conformity in Religion, it is visible the Success has not an∣swered the Design, and that the Difficulty is invincible; We therefore out of Our Princely Care and Affection unto all Our Loving Subjects, that they may live at Ease and Quiet, and for the Increase of Trade, and Incouragement of Stran∣gers, have thought fit, by Virtue of Our Royal Preroga∣tive, to issue forth this Our Declaration of Indulgence; making no doubt of the Concurrence of Our Two Houses of
Parliament, when we shall think it convenient for them to meet. In the first Place We do declare, That We will Protect and Maintain Our Archbishops, Bishops, and Clergy, and all o∣ther Our Subjects of the Church of England, in the free Ex∣ercise of their Religion, as by Law Established, and in the Quiet and full Enjoyment of all their Possessions, with∣out any Molestation on Disturbance whatsoever. We do likewise declare, That it is Our Royal Will and Pleasure, That from henceforth the Execution of all, and all manner of Penal Laws in Matters Ecclesiastical, for not coming to Church, or not Receiving the Sacrament, or for any other Non-conformity to the Religion Established, or for, or by Reason of the Exercise of Religion in any manner whatso∣ever, be immediately suspended; And the further Executi∣on of the said Penal Laws, and every of them is hereby sus∣pended. And to the End that by the Liberty hereby granted, the Peace and Security of Our Government in the Practice there∣of, may not be indangered, We have thought fit, and do hereby straitly Charge and Command all our Loving Subjects, That as We do freely give them Leave to Meet and Serve God after their own Way and Manner, be it in Private Houses, or Places purposely Hired or Built for that Use; so that they take especial Care, that nothing be Preached or Taught amongst them, which may any ways tend to Alienate the Hearts of Our People from Us, or Our Government; And that their Meetings and Assemblies be peaceably, open∣ly, and publickly held, and all Persons freely admitted to them; And that they do signifie and make known to some one or more of the next Justices of the Peace, what Place or Places they set apart for those Uses. And that all Our Subjects may enjoy such their Religious Assemblies with greater Assurance and Protection, We have thought it requisite, and do hereby Command, That no Di∣sturbance of any kind be made or given unto them, under Pain of Our Displeasure, and to be further proceeded against with the uttermost Severity. And, forasmuch as We are desirous to have the Benefit of the Service of all Our loving Subjects, which by the Law of Nature is inseparably annexed to, and inherent in Our Royal Person: And that none of Our Subjects may for the future be under any Discouragement or Disability (who are otherwise well inclined and fit to serve Us) by Rea∣son of some Oaths or Tests, that have been usually admini∣stred on such Occasions: We do hereby further declare, That it is Our Royal Will and Pleasure, that the Oaths common∣ly called, The Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance; and also the
several Tests and Declarations mentioned in the Acts of Par∣liament made in the 25th and 30th Years of the Reign of Our late Royal Brother Charles the Second, shall not at any time hereafter be required to be Taken, Declared, or Subscribed by any Person or Persons whatsoever, who is or shall be imployed in any Office or Place of Trust, either Ci∣vil or Military, under Us or in Our Government. And We do further declare it to be Our Pleasure and Intention from time to time hereafter, to Grant Our Royal Dispensations under Our Great Seal to all Our loving Subjects so to be Im∣ployed, who shall not take the said Oaths, or subscribe or declare the said Tests or Declarations in the above-mention∣ed Acts and every of them. And to the End that all Our Loving Subjects may receive and enjoy the full Benefit and Advantage of Our gracious Indulgence hereby intended, and may be acquitted and dis∣charged from all Pains, Penalties, Forfeitures, and Disabili∣ties by them or any of them incurred or forfeited, or which they shall or may at any time hereafter be liable to, for, or by reason of their Non-conformity, or the Exercise of their Religion, and from all Suits, Troubles, or Disturbances for the same: We do hereby give Our free and ample Pardon unto all Non-conformists, Recusants, and other Our Loving Subjects, for all Crimes and Things by them committed, or done contrary to the Penal Laws formerly made relating to Religion and the Profession or Exercise thereof. Hereby de∣claring, That this Our Royal Pardon and Indemnity shall be as good and effectual to all Intents and Purposes, as if every individual Person had been therein particularly named, or had particular Pardons under Our Great Seal, which We do likewise declare shall from time to time be granted unto any Person or Persons desiring the same: Willing and Re∣quiring Our Judges, Justices, and other Officers, to take Notice of and Obey Our Royal Will and Pleasure herein be∣fore declared. And although the Freedom and Assurance We have hereby given in relation to Religion and Property, might be suffi∣cient to remove from the Minds of our Loving Subjects all Fears and Jealousies in relation to either; yet We have thought fit further to declare, That We will Maintain them in all their Properties and Possessions, as well of Church and Abby-Lands, as in any other their Lands and Properties whatsoever. Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Fourth Day of April, 1687. In the Third Year of Our Reign.
The Generality of Protestant Dissenters having for near 7 Years together, been so severely treated by the Tory Party, were as forward to congratulate the King for his Indulgence in several Addresses, as the Tories were in King Charles his Time, in their Addresses of Abhorrence, to Petition the King to call a Parliament to settle the Grievances of the Nation. However, this Declaration was drawn up so in sight of every Bird, that most part of the Thinking sort of Dissenters did dread and detest it: But yet, to make it more passable, Po∣pish Judges were made in Westminister-Hall, and Popish Ju∣stices of the Peace, and Deputy-Lieutenants all England over, while the Privy-Council was filled up with Popish Councel∣lors; nay, the Savoy was laid open to instruct Youth in the Popish Religion, and Popish Principles; which gave Occasion to that good Man, Dr. Tenison, now Archbishop of Canterbury, and it ought to be remembred always to his Honour, to erect his Free School at St. Martins in opposition to it. But this would not stop the Popish Zeal; for, other Schools to the same End were encouraged in London, and all other Places in Eng∣land; and 4 Foreign Popish Bishops, as Vicars Apostolical, were allowed in Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction all England and Wales over. And because his Majesty would not be wanting to pay his Duty as well as other Catholick Princes, to the common Father of them all, the Pope; the Earl of Castlemain was sent Embassador to Rome, to tender the King's Obedience to the Holy and Apostolical See, with great Hopes of extirpating the Northern pestilent Heresie: In return whereof the Pope sent his Nuncio to give the King his Holy Benediction, and that without sending before-hand, as his Predecessors were wont to do, for leave to enter the Kingdom. To all this we may add, that the Judges in their Circuits had their private Instructions, to know how Men stood affect∣ed towards the King's Dispensing Power; and those who shew∣ed the least Dislike of it, were turned out of their Offices and Employments without any more ado: And that these Things might be acted with Security, Tyrconnel having dis∣banded the English Army in Ireland, qualified by the Tests to serve, sent over an Army of Irish that were not qualified, to encrease the English Army, who by this time were grown into∣lerably insolent; though the King, by several Orders, would have had their Quarters restrained to Victualling Houses, Houses of Publick Entertainment, and such as had Licenses to sell Wine and other Liquors. The Officers too, when they pleased, would be exempt from the Civil Power: And tho' the King had no other War upon his Hands, but against the Laws and Constitutions of the Government, yet he would make an obsolete Act of Parliament, that made it Felony
without Benefit of Clergy, for any Soldier's taking Pay in the King's Service, in his Wars beyond Sea, or upon the Sea, or in Scotland, to desert from his Officer, to extend to this new-raised Army. And because the worthy Recorder of London, Sir John Holt, would not expound that Law according to the King's Design, he was put out of his Place; and so was Sir Edward Herbert from being Chief Justice of the King's-Bench, to make way for Sir Robert Wright, to hang a poor Soldier up∣on the said Statute, which afterwards did the Job without any further Dispute. It would be an endless Thing to enumerate the disorderly Proceedings of this Year; yet, I doubt, you will hear of no less in the next; but you must stay a little, and take a View of Foreign Proceedings, before we shall have leisure to enter upon them. And first we shall again begin with Hungary, since we have nothing considerable nearer Home, where the Imperial Arms, to say nothing of other Advantages, had prevailed wonder∣fully in taking of Buda, the Capital of that Kingdom, which so nettled the Turks, that they resolved to use their utmost Efforts to retrieve their Honour this Season, while the Impe∣rialists were not idle on their part; and the Scheme of the Summer's Business seemed to have been thus designed: The whole Army, which amounted to 62900 fighting Men, be∣sides the Troops of the Circles of Swabia and Franconia, and others, was to be divided into 3 Bodies; the 1st being to act in Vpper Hungary, under the Command of the Elector of Ba∣aria; the 2d in Lower Hungary, under that of the Duke of Lorrain; and the 3d upon the Frontiers of Croatia, under Ge∣neral Dunewald; and that they might have Communication one with another, there were 2 Bridges made, one over the Drave, near Tarnovitz, and another over the Danube, near Buda, in the Isle of St. Marguerite; and with this Disposition all the Troops rendezyoused near Barkan, where the Duke of Lorrain arrived May 13, in Person, from whence he sent out several Spies to discover the Number and Posture of the Ene∣my. These reported, They were stronger than the Imperial Army, and were busie in repairing the Bridge of Esseck; which, after divers Consultations, made the Duke move towards the said Place, and the Croatian Army advanced also the same Way, while the Elector of Bavaria, with the Army under his Command, seemed to threaten Erla in Vpper Hungary. But other Work was cut out for them in the Lower, as you'll hear by and by.The Duke of Lorrain towards  For the Duke of Lorrain being advanced towards Feutar, broke up June 17, from thence, and continued his March towards Esseck, and because the Army left Alba Rega∣lis behind it, a Body of Light-Horse were left behind to cover
the Baggage; and on the 18th a Bridge of Boats was laid near Tolna, over which the whole Army passed by the 20th, and encamped a Mile from thence, and removed afterwards to Mohatz, as they did their Bridge likewise, that so the 2 Ar∣mies might succour each other. The Duke at the same time sent an Express to the Croatian Troops, to secure the Bridge that was laid over the Drave, near Syclos, and there erect like∣wise that of Boats that they carried along with them, which was punctually performed. From Mohatz the Duke marched on the 24th to Darda, aside of the Bridge of Esseck; which, as soon as the Turks, who were hard at work in repairing the Bridges over the Morass, had Notice of, they abandoned their Works, and retreated towards the Bridge of Boats they had over the Drave, and which they had secured with a good Fort of Earth and Wood, having left some Bodies of Horse and Foot among the Moraffes, to dispute the Approach of it with the Imperialists. The Duke, the Night following, caused the Bridge, and Disposition of the Enemy to be view'd, and order∣ed the necessary Detachments to attack them by Break of Day, when Word was brought him, that the Enemy had taken a∣way 2 Boats of their Bridges, and that there was no appea∣rance of them. However, a Detachment from the Army crossed the Morasses on the 25th, and advanced towards the Enemies Bridge of Boats in good Order, who, when the Chri∣stians were come within an 150 Paces of them, fired very fu∣riously upon them, so as that they were forced a little to re∣treat; but being sustained with fresh Troops, they charged the Turks with so much Resolution, that they quitted their Post, and retreated into their Fort, from whence the Imperia∣lists also drove them, whom they pursued as far as the Gare of Esseck, where they had like to have entred the Town Pell∣mell with them. The Imperialists endeavoured to preserve the Bridge, but several Mills and Boats being set on float, were by the Rapidity of the Stream thrown so impetuously upon it, that they broke one part of it, and hindred the rest from being seized on, inso∣much, that it was now thought most advisable to set it on fire. Next Day, after having viewed the Ground, and a Draught taken for the Building of a new Fort, they began to break Ground, which yet was not done without Disturbance from the Enemy; but the very same Day, the Christians entirely ruined the Dykes which the Turks had made upon the Morasses, in the room of the Bridges that had been burnt towards the End of the last Campaign, which was difficult Work; And then it was resolved, that a Line of Communication should be drawn from the Entrance of the Morasses, as far as the Fort, that so under its cover the Troops might pass, that
should be needful for its Defence, in case the Turks were mind∣ed to attack it. Things thus passed on till the 28th, when the Duke of Lorain having chose out from among the Sol∣diers, such as could Swim best, he ordered them to go and fire the Boats, Mills, and Barges which the Turks had posted within Musket-shot of Esseck. They punctually executed their Orders, but the Enemy put out the Fire before it produced any Effect; which, with many other Considerations, made the Duke call a Council of War next Day, where having judged it impossible to pass the Drave at the Place where they were encamped, it was resolved to break up from thence; And accordingly on the 30th, the Duke having left the Ca∣valry to guard the Pass, and to ruine the Bridges of the Morass, departed with the Infantry, a Regiment of Curas∣siers, and one of Dragoons, and moved up the Drave, to∣wards the Fort, which the Imperialists had over that River near Siclos, near unto which he arrived July 1, sending at the same time some Detachments out to scowr the Fields, and discover the Posture of the Enemy, of whom they could get no certain Intelligence. Yet the Duke failed in his Ex∣pectation of passing the River there also, which was so over∣flown, that there was no Possibility of it; So that he sent Troops up along the same, to try if there was no other place where he might do it, and resolved, that in case it was im∣possible, to imploy his Army in the Siege of Sigeth. But the Time spun out to the 5th of the Month, when General Dun∣wald, who came from the other side of the River, with be∣tween and 4000 Men, Horse and Foot, was ordered by the Duke to post the Heydukes upon the Hills, in order to facili∣tate the Passage of the Troops, while in the mean time, 9 Bridges were finished that had been ordered to be laid over Morasses: So that on the 6th, some Companies of Foot and Dragoons were wasted over in Boats, with Orders to incamp on the other side of the Drave, and there to intrench them∣selves, which they did with great Diligence, being assisted therein mightily with 1200 Peasants, brought thither for that Purpose: And notwithstanding the variety of different Re∣ports that were spread concerning the Enemies Army, the whole Army, Horse and Foot, together with their Artillery and Baggage, passed the Drave by the 13th, when the E∣lector of Bavaria came into the Camp, having left his Troops some Leagues of, which got up towards the Evening, and then a Review was taken of the Army, which was found to be 55000 Men. From the foresaid Place the Army marched to∣wards the Enemy, and on their Way heard divers uncertain Reports concerning their Number, Strength and Design, but they moved on, and the Elector of Bavaria, who Commanded
the Van guard, did on the 17th place himself at the Head of some Squadrons and 2 Battallions, with some Dragoons, and 2 Field-Pieces, in Battel Array, as well as the Ground would admit in a Plain interlain with Wood, and faced on the other side with a Morass; and in this Posture found 3000 of the E∣nemies Horse, advantageously posted at the Entrance of the Defiles, whom he charged with that Bravery, that they quit∣ted their Post, which 2 of his Battallions took possession of. The Army at the same time moving forwards through the Defiles, the Duke of Lorrain lead the Van on the 18th, and after very great Difficulty from the Badness of the Ways, and Firings of the Enemies Detachments, who killed a great ma∣ny of the Christians, they were by the 20th draws up in Bat∣tel Array, in the Form of an Half-Moon, about half a League from the Turkish Camp. The Duke of Lorrain did all that was possible to draw the Turks to a Battel, and sent several Detachments to skirmish to the very Head of their Retrenchments, but all to no Pur∣pose; So that the Christians perceived by the Enemies Coun∣tenance, they were not disposed to fight, tho' they made great use of their Ordinance all the while. But it was not thought at all expedient to attack them there, seeing they were so strongly intrenched, and that since the coming up of the Grand Visier, their Number was computed to be near 80000 Men. esides all which, the Christians beginning to want Forage, Provisions and Ammunition, it was resolved, af∣ter 24 Hours stay, in a Council of War, to decamp from thence, which was done on the 21st, and the Retreat made in very good Order, the Turks not concerning themselves much to hin∣der it, only they contented themselves vigorously to change a Guard, that had been out off if the Elector of Bavania, at the Head of a Neuburg Squadron, had not succoured them; so that the Army on the 23d repassed the Drave, but had like to have perished first: For some Traytors holding Intelligence with the Grand Visier, had undertaken to cut the Cables that held the Bridges, but the Design was happily discovered, and one of the Officers seiz'd, and immediately Empaled, his wicked Accomplishes having by their Flight escaped the Punishment: So that, in short, the Army by the 29th was got near to Ma∣hatz, where they were reinforced with the Swabian Troops, amounting to 8000 Men, which enabled the Duke, besides a Detachment sent under Veterani to reinforce the Blockade of Agia, and another towards Croatia, to send a strong Body of 8000 Men under General Dunwald, to cover Syclos and Five Churches, while himself with the main Army designed to di∣rect his March towards Felixmarton, But that Resolution was quickly changed upon his receiving Information on the
31st, That the Grand Visier had the Night before passed the Bridges near Esseck with his whole Army, who spent Aug. 1, in intrenching themselves, which yet did not hinder the Duke to advance towards them, to engage them, if possible, to a Battel; and to give that gallant Man his due, he neg∣lected nothing on his part that might induce them to it▪ though with little appearance of Success: Till at last being vex'd with the Loss of Time, he resolved to make the Army fall back, as well to get at some distance from a Wood, whence the Tartars disturbed his Foragers, as to induce once more the Grand Visier to quit his Camp and to follow him. This Re∣treat was done on the 8th, but without Success neither; which put the Imperialists upon making a shew, as if they would take away the Garrisons of Syclos and Five Churches, and abandon those Places, and accordingly they continued a slow March that way. And thus Things continued to the 12th, when the Grand Visier, possibly at last, presuming that the Christians declined Fighting,The Battel of Mohatz. caused the greatest part of his Troops to advance, and about 2 in the Afternoon 10000 Spahi's, and 5000 Jani∣zaries were seen directly to march upon the Left Wing of the Imperialists, where the Duke of Bavaria, with Prince Lewis of Baden, Commanded. They were led on by some Bodies of Horse, whose Charge General Dunwald vigorously stood the Brunt of, after which he retreated upon the first Line; when in a Moment after, a Body of Janizaries posted themselves upon a rising Ground with some Pieces of Cannon, laden with Chain-shot, which fired upon the Left of the Imperialists, to endeavour to put them into Disorder. This, and the advan∣cing of the 10000 Spahi's, made the Duke of Bavaria to order the Front of the Left Wing to be enlarged, according as he perceived that of the Enemy to do, which yet could not hin∣der, Time enough, the Regiments of Savoy and Commercy to be attacked both in Front and Flank, with extraordinary Fury, who stood as firmly to it, till the Elector hasted thither to assist them, where he received a slight Wound by a Bullet in his Hand. But while Things passed thus on the Left, the Duke of Lorain had formed a Crescent on the Right Wing, whose Right extended towards the Flank of the Enemy, who attackt the Left, and the Left side went to encounter another Body of Spahi's, and Janizaries that came up to charge them; And now the Battel grew very hot, and they fought a long time on both sides with extraordinary Courage, the Turks being ob∣served to do it more orderly than in former Battels. But at length the Day inclined in favour of the Christian Army, the Infidels beginning by little and little to lose Ground; and very quickly after betook themselves to an open Fight, the Impe∣rialists
pursuing them to their very Camp, which they entred Pell-mell with the Conquered, made an horrible Slaughter of all that came before them, and mastered all the Retrench∣ments without halting, and all with the Loss of not above 700 Men. But it cost the Turks much dearer, for besides 2000 slain upon the Spot, there was a vast Number of them drown∣ed in the Morasses, and the River into which they fell by the breaking of the Bridge, which being put together, made it amount by the Estimate of some to about 16000 Men. But how uncertain soever the Number of Men lost might be, the Booty was very great and beneficials; for, besides an 116 Pieces of Cannon and Mortars, a vast Quantity of Ammunition, with divers Standards and Colours, there was a World of Silver and precious Moveables found in the Camp; and particularly the Elector of Bavaria had a very rich Booty of the Grand Vi∣sier's Tent for his Share, which was so vast, that it rather re∣sembled a Castle than what it was really made for, and was enriched with Gold, Pearls and precious Stones, all that Offi∣cer's Plate, his Jewels, Moveables, Chancery, and 40000 Duc∣kats that were found in his Treasury. But though this Blow might have been thought to be a fatal one to the Turks,Transilva∣nia revolts. yet there was one Accident hapned in the Nick of it, that gave them an Opportunity to breath and re-assume some fresh Strength, and diverted the main Army of the Christians in the Designs they had to prosecute their Advan∣tages upon the Drave; And that was the Prince of Transilva∣nia (notwithstanding the Treaty he had made with the Empe∣ror) his suddain declaring himself in favour of the Port. But this we shall come to by and by, and observe at present, that though the most important Work of the remaining Campaign was to endeavour to reduce the said Prince to the former Com∣pact, yet there was a Necessity of covering Syclos▪ and Five Churches, and therefore this Work was consigned into the Hands of General Dunwald, who had further Orders to en∣deavour to pass the Drave, and attempt as he saw Opportunity the Fortress of Esseck, and other Places possest by the Turks in Sclavonia. It was on the 30th of Aug. before the said Gene∣ral could pass the Drave, and what with cross Intelligence and had Weather, he made it the 11th of Sept. before he began the Siege of the Castle of Butschin,Butschin be∣sieged by the Impe∣rialists. situated between the Drave and the Save, the taking of which would be a means for the Troops of Croatia to extend their Winter-Quarters as far as the last of the said Rivers. The Works were carried on with much Ap∣plication, and the Commanding Aga summoned to surrender, whose Answer was. To defend the Place to the last Extremi∣ty, which he had so much the more Reason for, in that the Bey of Possega had sent him Word, he would speedily relieve him,
and threatning withal, to empale him if he performed not his Duty. However, the Battery that was directed against the Castle having, by the 14th, made a considerable Breach, it made the Aga, seeing now the Place was in great Danger of being taken by Storm, think better of the Matter and beat a Parley: But no other Terms would be allowed him, than a Surrender at Discretion; which he was forced to submit to, and consign into the Hands of the Imperialists that important Fortress, which laid about 100 Villages under Contribution, and covered Virovitza and St. George from the Enterprizes of the Turks; and was a Means to hinder them from passing the Drave, to put Succours into Sigeth and Canisia. But though this successful Enterprize seemed to promise so much, yet what followed, in relation to Esseck, was of much greater Importance: For, tho' the General, according to the first Intelligence he re∣ceived in relation to the Garrison, thought he should be obli∣ged to force it by a formal Siege; yet being soon after in∣formed by a Deserter,Esseck aban∣doned by the Turks. that the Garrison of the said Place ha∣ving Notice of his March, had abandoned it on the 29th of Sept. and that so hastily, that they forgot to fire 7 Mines for the blowing up the Fortifications at their Retreat; He was as much surprized at the Relation at first, as he was over-joyed afterwards, when, upon the Information of the Count de Lo∣dron, whom, upon the News, he had detached thither, he was confirmed of the Truth of the Deserter's Account: With this further Addition, That he found 52 Pieces of Cannon, 4 Mortars and a vast Quantity of Ammunition and Provisions therein▪ The Consequence of this Desertion of Esseck was, the Surren∣der of Walpo at Discretion, and the Abandouing of Possega, the Capital City of Sclavonia, with some other Places on that side. But as for the principal Army, under the Command of the Duke of Lorain, they passed the Danube on the 19th of Aug. near Mohatz, directing their March towards Peter-Waradin, which the Duke had an Eye upon before he went any fur∣ther; but finding the Grand Visier advantageously posted with his whole Army not far from it, and that his Design was im∣practicable, he moved towards Segedin, where the Duke staid till the 15th of Sept.Transylva∣nia reduced by the Im∣perialists. expecting the Emperor's Orders; and then he passed the Theysse, marching directly towards Transyl∣vania, to take up his Winter-Quarters there, (tho' the Auxi∣liary Troops of Suabia refused to march along with him,) which all the Submission, and Offers of Money, and other Refreshments, by Prince Abafti, who was now sensible of his Error, would not exempt him from: For the Duke wholly re∣duced that Country under the Emperor's Obedience, causing all the Prince's Troops to evacuate the Fortresses, into which
he put Imperial Forces; and withal, concluded a very advan∣tageous Treaty with Prince Abafti, and the States of Transyl∣vania. This so much more heightned the Joy of the Imperial Court, now at Presburg, the Capital City of Imperial Hungary, since they had, by that time the Duke of Lorain arrived there, so well settled all Things with the States of that Country, in relation to Arch-Duke Joseph,Arch-Duke Joseph crowned K. of Hungary. the Emperor's eldest Son, his being invested with the Regal Dignity of that Kingdom, that the Ceremony of the Coronation of him was performed not long after, viz. on the 9th of Dec. with the greatest Solemni∣ty. And if the Regaining the Submission of one Principality for the Father, and the Investiture of a Kingdom for the Son, made the one a Sweetning for the other,Agria sur∣render'd to the Imperi∣alists. the Surrender of A∣gria before the End of Nov. by the Turks, into the Hands of Count Caraffa, for His Imperial Majesty's Use, was still so much the more engaging, since it was not at this time expect∣ed, and that it was thus gained upon such easie Terms, by the Way of a Blockade only; whereas, the Turkish Emperor Ma∣homet, in the Year 1596, brought no less than 150000 Men to take it, which yet they could not do in less than a 3 Weeks Siege. But there is nothing can withstand Hunger; and the 150 Pieces of Cannon which the Imperilists found in the Place, might serve, indeed, as they did, for Defence, but not Food, whereof the Garrison was in great Want; Insomuch, that of 4000 Turks that marched out, the 4th part of them were not able to bear Arms, they were so extreamly debilita∣ted by Famine, they having for above 2 Months subsisted only upon Leaves of Trees, and boiled Herbs. All this ustein Basha was very sensible of, when he told Count Carassa, up∣on his delivering to him the Keys; That he put into his Hands that important Place which was taken by his Prince's own Hands; and which he was compelled to deliver up to him without any Effu∣sion of Blood, after having lived there, with his Musselmens 7 whole Months without Bread; Bidding him give God Thanks, since it was he that so ordered it. Now, before we go any farther, 'tis fit we enquire a little into what Effects, these mighty Advantages or the Impeialists had in the Turkish Empire;The Revo∣lution of the Turkish Empire, ended with the Depo∣sing of Ma∣bomet IV. and advan∣cing his Bro∣ther Soly∣man to the Throne. and the rather, since it seemed to have been a kind of Preldium to what happen'd amongst our selves, about 12 Months after in England. The Intestine Di∣visions which reigned in the Otoman Army, even before their great Overthrow this Campaign, chiefly begun between Soly∣man the Grand Vister, and Osman Basha, broke forth now into so violent a Flame as could not be extinguished without even shaking the Foundations of the mpire it self: For, though the Grand Visier, by his great Authority, obtained private Orders from the Port to secure Osman and his Adherenfs, yet Osman
found the Means to penetrate into the Design very early; And therefore, he being a Person that knew how to captivate the Affections of the Soldiery by the Means of Booty, as having been once the Head of the Asiatick Highway men, he sped so far as to make them Mutiny against Solyman; who finding he had no Forces to stand by him, and no Means to pacifie the Mu∣tineers, he thought fit, together with the Tefterdan, or Grand∣Treasurer, and Rais Effendt the Grand-Chancellor, to flee by Water to Adrianople, there to expect the Grand Signior's fur∣ther Orders; and employed Rogeb the Caimacan of Constanti∣nople, who had been advanced by him to that Office, to paci∣fie the Grand Signior's Displeasure upon the Overthrow of the Army. Herein he succeeded for the Visier so far; but withal, had a Promise to have himself advanced into the other's Place. In the mean time, the mutinous Troops, and Osman Basha, fearing the Representations of the Grand Visier, chose 4 De∣puties to attend the Grand Signior, to represent their Grie∣vances to him; while he, in the mean time, had ordered, that a Vest and Sword should be dispatched to Osman, declaring him Serasquier, and permitting Solyman to go to Constanti∣nople; who, on his Way, understanding the Designs of the Ar∣my to have him deposed, he consigned the Seal and Standard of Mahomet into the Hands of the Treasurer and Chancellor, and went privately into the City, hoping, by the Means of the Caimacan, his supposed Creature, to facilitate his Ingress to the Grand Signior; while the fore-mentioned Deputies pre∣vailed in the mean time to get Osman declared Grand Visier. But how speedy soever these Remedies against the impending Evils were thought to be, the Soldiers Disorders were more forward; who were not only now intent upon their own Sa∣tisfaction, but proceeded from Military, to Political Matters, and to lay hand even to the Helm it self; to which End they marched away for Constantinople, with a firm Resolution, and solemn Vow, to reform the present Government; and cause to fall, as Victims to their own Establishment, the Head of the Kistar Aga, and Chief of the Black Eunuchs, who was the Grand Signior's chiefest Favourite, and divers O∣thers. Mahomet the Grand Signior was mightily surprized with this Advice; and, notwithstanding the good Counsel given him by the Caimacan, of retiring to the great Seraglio, with some choice Troops, and there make a bold Stand against the Mu∣tineers, and of procuring a Sentence from the Mufti to de∣clare them Guilty of High-Treason; he could gain little up∣on them in the first Point, or upon the Mufti in the latter: So that the Caimacan turned about to feel the Aga of the Ja∣nizaries his Pulse, whom he found not averse to his Intenti∣ons.
But the Caimacan's Diligence drew upon him the Envy of the Kisar Aga, who failed not to inform the Grand Signi∣or, that he held Correspondence with the Mutineers; and im∣posed so far upon his credulous Mind, as to prevail with him to give Orders for securing the Caimacan; which was not long uneffected, and he committed Prisoner to the Seraglio. All this while the Army was advancing, and the Officer sent with the Seal and Standard to Osman, met them at Nissa, near Sophia, just at the time the Soldiers, in a Tumult, had killed Emir Basha, and the Treasurer, whom the Grand Signior had ordered back to the Army (with some others) for having a∣bandoned them, and followed the Grand Visier in his light. Neither were they idle at Constantinople; for the Grand Signi∣or, with such as adhered to him, having on the 4th of Oct. held a Council upon the emergent Conjuncture, they resolved, as the best Expedient to satisfie the Mutineers, to send them the Heads of such as were obnoxious to them; and they began with that of Solyman Basha, which was dispatched to the Ar∣my, with an Offer from the Grand Signior of any other, even those of his own Sons, to appease them. But this would not do neither; for the Soldiers openly said, They had not in the least desired Solyman's Head, but to have him alive in their Hands, to give an exact Account of the Money levied last Year, for the Ser∣vice of the War. When the Courier that was dispatched with Solyman's Head, returned to Constantinople, he found divers o∣ther Persons turned out of their Employments, and no less Confusion there than before; which the Grand Signior still per∣ceiving, did not satisfie the Army, he attempted the cunning est Stratagem to fix himself in the Throne that possibly could be devised, had it met with a suitable Success: He asked to speak with his Brother Solyman, giving those about him to understand, that he meant to recommend his Sons to him, see∣ing it became him to give way to the Force of his Destiny. But for all that, he fostered under this Fiction a resolute Spi∣rit, to take away his own Sons and Brother's Lives; that so the Army might be obliged to continue him at the Helm, there being no other of the Imperial Line. But the now Camaican suspecting the Treachery, ordered the Kisar Aga to go into the Streets, near the Walls of the Seraglio, and ad∣monish the Grand Signior not to make any Attempt against his own Blood; and to forbear giving any Suspicion, by seek∣ing to enter into the Apartments of his Sons and Brother; because that the Janizaries had surrounded the Seraglio, and would surprize him if he did not continue quiet. This Enter∣prize being thus interrupted, he found himself now excluded from all Means of maintaining himself in the Sovereign Pow∣er; and the next Stroak that presaged his invitable Fate,
was, his being given to understand, that his Sons were taken from him, and put under a safe Guard, with the greater Se∣curity to co-operate for the Brother's Safety. After this he found himself coup'd up within the Confines of the Seraglio, by the Caimacan's Order; and all the Liberty he had left was, to repair as often as he pleased to a Kisoh upon the Sea-shoar, under the Walls of the Seraglio; which terminated also upon the 29th of Oct. for the Army was now near. Thereupon the Caimacan, Mufti and Caydelesker, with some principal Per∣sons of the Law, meeting at St. Sophia, and having performed their Devotions, they sent presently the Chiaux-Pachi to the Seraglio, and followed him themselves. As soon as they were admitted, they required Sultan Solyman, who being brought forth, was immediately placed upon the Throne: He, upon so great and unexpected Tidings, was not at all ruffled or chan∣ged, but with great Modesty and Humility, laying his Hand upon his Breast, bowed down, and in a few Words render'd them Thanks; after this he was Proclaimed Emperor through all the Parts of the City. Yet the discontented Janizaries, and others, were not appeased, but a few Persons of Note more be∣ing sacrificed to their Rage, and a Sum of Money distributed among them, brought Things at length into a tolerable State of Settlement. And now its time we should inspect a little in∣to Things on the Part of the Venetians, and the Progress of the Arms of that Republick. How glorious soever the Imperialists have reckon'd this Cam∣paign to have proved unto them,Sign besie∣ged by the Turks, and relieved by the Vene∣tians. the Venetians have not a whit the less Esteem for what their Troops had done both in Dal∣atia and the Mirea. Its true, the Turks were before hand with them in the former, by taking the field; for 2 of their Basha's, early in the Spring, laid Siege to Sign, hoping to car∣ry it, before the other were in a State to give it Relief: But the Governour, the Marquess de Borri, proved so resolute, and the Garrison that consisted of about 700 Men, so obstinate in the Defence of it, that they withstood all the fierce Attacks of the Infidels till the 22th of April, in which time General Cor∣naro had, having drawn together near 14000 Men, advanced towards the Turks, who, upon Information of their Resoluti∣on and Strength raised the Siege the next Day: And this hap∣pened so much more to the Advantage of the Venetians, in that (if the latter had not come up in that Nick of Time) the Turks would have been reinforced with 3000 Men that they hourly expected, and then such an Additional Force would render the Enterprize very dangerous, when as the Turks were already Superiour in Number to the Christians. But though this Disadvantage at the first taking of the Field seem∣ed to be ominous to the Turks, and did more than a little
aunt them; yet the Basha of Erzegovina, thinking to have a Reparation for this Affront, resolved to attack the Portress of Opusch, a small Place situated upon the River Narenta, and actually invested it with near 3000 Men; of which General Cornaro had no sooner Intimation, but he caused some Troops to march that way, and having sent Orders to Chevalier Janco, to repair thither immediately with the Morlaques, 3 Gallies, several Galliots, and some other Vessels for the Transportation of the Troops; The Basha thereupon was so far from presuming to proceed on with his Attacks, that he thought an hasty Retreat the best Expedient for himself and Men. Neither did the Turks come off with this Fright only, for the Morlaques plundered and reduced to Ashes the Suburbs of Dumno, several Villages of that Country, took divers Pri∣soners, and brought away a vast Number of great and small Cattel. Hitherto the Venetians were but on the Defensive in this Coun∣try,Castlenovo besieged by the Veneti∣ans, but they were resolved not to continue always so; and therefore General Cornaro having Joined the Auxiliary Gallies, after the necessary Preparations, and some Difficulties that had been raised concerning the Supream Commands, had been ad∣justed, on the 1 of Sept. came in sight of Castlenovo, the Capital City of St. Sabba, situate upon the Banks of the Canal of Ca∣tarro, 3 Miles from its Mouth, and just opposite to the Levant Sea; But the Wind proving somewhat contrary, and the Ene∣my having made some Retrenchments, he found great Difficul∣ty in landing: However, through the Constancy of the Auxi∣liary Troops, who had Orders given them to land nearer the City than where the first Attempt was, all Opposition was over-come after an Onset of 5 Hours continuance, wherein the Auxiliaries were seconded by Generl Paulo with 2 Battalions: Insomuch that they made themselves not only Masters of the 1st Trenches but also the next Day took the 2d from the Enemy, so far as to possess the Hill Vencranda that commands the Place, and with 2 small Pieces of Cannon drove them out of all the Houses without the Circuit of the City. But this was not done without Loss on both sides, while the Bombs, in the mean time, did great Damage both in the Town and Castle; and the Guns were continually firing, in order to make a Breach, as well as Mines preparing to ruine some works that obstructed the Be∣siegers Passage. Yet, what from the Attempts made from with∣out to succour the Place, though ineffectually, and what with the continual Rains that fell, it was the 28th of Sept. before the Mines were sprung, which happned to be with good Success; and made the General prepare all things for an Assault. The Gallies and Galliots began to fire very hard upon the Town, while the Dragoons, the Troops of Maltha and Abruzzo, with
the Granadeers at the Head of them, attack'd the Breach with great Resolutions; but the Besieged being much more nume∣rous than was expected, gave them such a vigorous Recepti∣on, as to repulse, and put them into Disorder, with the Loss of near 200 Men. However, the Officers, by their own Ex∣ample, did so well encourage the Troops, that notwithstand∣ing all the Resistance the Turks made, and a Retirade fortified with Palliadoes, and a deep Ditch, they made a Lodgment there, and fortified themselves. Next Day, which was the the 29th, the Works were pushed on by the Morlaques to the very oot of the Rampart against an huge Tower, and a 2d Assault was made with all possible Courage, though without succeeding; but the Day following those of Abruzzo, being seconded by the Albanese, and some Italian Regiments, forced the Retrenchments of the Besieged; and the other Troops ad∣vancing at the same time to second them, they made them∣selves Masters of some Houses, which being succeeded next Night by the Surrender of an high Tower upon the Sea, where the Standard of St. Mark was quickly displayed, as also upon the Houses the Venetians had taken; and all this being per∣ceived next Morning by the Turks, they withdrew into the Castle, and set up a White lag to Capitulate. After some Contestation about the Articles, they gave up the Place to the Christians, upon Condition of marching out with their Arms unmolested; though the Venetian General had much ado to secure them from the Fury of the Maltese, who being enraged at the Loss of divers Knights, would have put all the Garrison to the Sword: And the Conquest of this Place be∣came so much the more glorious, in that it was almost taken in the sight of the Basha of Erzegovina, who was marching with 9000 Men to the Relief of it. General Cornaro having giving all necessary Orders for the Security of his Conquest, his next Design lay upon Dulcigno; but the Season being too far spent, and the Auxiliary Gallies bent upon returning Home, he laid by that Enterprize, contenting himself to take in the Castle of Conovich and Clobuki, and divers other smaller Places for the Enlargement of his Winter-Quarters, to which the Troops there began now to retire. But though these Advantages in Dalmatia, both in respect to the Defensive and Offeasive War of this Campaign, were very much redounding to the Glory of the Republick's Arms; they were comparatively nothing in regard to the Progress that was made in the Morea, under the auspiciou Conduct of Genereal Morosini, who after he had caused Te Deum to Sung upon the absolute Cessation of the Sickness in that Coun∣try, and taken a Review of all his Forces, did July 23, set sil for Patrass, situated about 700 Paces from the Gulph of Pa∣trazzo,
and being come up near it, he caused part of his Troops to Land, and quickly found the Serasquier of the Morea, was advantageously incamped in that Neighbourhood, with 8 or 9000 Men,The Turks routed by the Vene∣tians. which yet did not hinder the Count of Coninsmark to advance and attack him on the 24th, and after an obstinate and long Fight to defeat him, with the Loss of about 500 Turks, among whom was the Basha of Vallona, besides 6 Field-pieces, and a World of Arms, Baggage and Colours that fell into the Hands of the Victors, who lost not above an 100 Men in the Action. But the Consequence was greater than the Victory; for the Turks immediately thereupon abandoned Pairass,The Turks abandon Patrass, Le∣panto. &c. the Castles of la Morea and Romalia, with the City and Castle of Lepanto, anciently called Naupactas, whose Gulph is about an 100 Miles in length, and into which Places as being of vast Consideration, as well to secure the Conquests made, as to be made by the Republick, the Captain General took Care to put good Garrisons; and having fitted up all the Turkish Gallies he found in the Gulph, and joined them to the rest of his Naval Power, he made Sail towards the Bottom of the Gulph, to make himself Master of Corinth, while Count Coninsmark marched the same Way by Land, at the Head of the Cavalry. The Serasquier at the same being terrified with the Defeat, and sensible he could no longer resist the Venetian Forces, sent to all the Governours of Places that were in the Possession of the Turks, to fire and abandon them, and then to retire to∣wards Thebes, whither he himself had made his escape with the Wrecks of his Army, but not without leaving where-ever he passed, Marks of his Rage and Despair: And, in short, he committed such Barbaritles and Disorders, that the People were forced to take up Arms for their own Defence, and being urged on by Despair, they killed him about 2000 Men in the Defiles, he could not avoid passing through, and where they laid several Ambuscades for him. So that by this Means that Noble Country of the Morea, the ancient Peloponesus fell entirely into the Hands of the Republick of Venice, except Na∣poli di Malvasia, of old Nauplia, which being then infected with the Plague, it was said General Morosini had declined to accept the Tender they had made him of their Keys, or to force them to surrender in case they should offer to make Opposition, but it was not got afterwards upon such easie Terms.Corinth a∣bandoned by the Turks, and several o∣ther Places. When Ge∣neral Morosini was come in sight of Corinth, he found it aban∣doned by the Turks, and set on fire, which he took Care in all haste to extinguish, and then sent several Ships towards Castle Tornesse, to oblige its Commander to abandon it; who no soon∣er saw them, but he desired to Capitulate, and was allowed to withdraw to Smyrna with all his Garrison, and had a Ship gi∣ven him to perform his Voyage; and this brought all the Vil∣lages in the Neighbourhood of Cerinth, to come voluntarily to
submit themselves to the Jurisdiction of the Republick. So was the City of Misitra, the Renowned and Ancient Spara forced to truckle, who, perhaps, out of an Emulation of its former Glory, pretended to do something more than the rest, by insisting upon very advantageous Conditions: But, alas! her Strength was, for many Ages past, decayed, and her Beauty faded, and her Singularity made her Chains but the hea∣vier, by being obliged, because of it, to pay a large Sum of Money to be exempted from Plunder. Before the General left the Place, he put a good Garrison into it, as the Turks who were there had Liberty allowed them, by the Capitulation that was granted them, to retire to Negropont; But the Command∣ing Basha in that Fortress would not receive them, under Pre∣tence that he had no more Provisions than were necessary for the Subsistance of his own Troops, and because he upbraided them with Cowardize for having abandned a Place they might have defended for some time; the Commander of Misi∣tra made Answer to these Reproaches in very offensive Terms, and would have entred by Force, which the other opposing, with his Troops, they came to Blows, and a great Number were killed and wountted on both sides. No doubt but the Venetian General was glad to find a Phili∣sline thus set against Philistine, while he had still the more lei∣sure to pursue his Point, who after the Cities of Cartena and Drobagbina, had carried him their Keys and voluntarily sub∣mitted, in some time after set sail for the once famous and ne∣ver to be forgotten  of Athens,Atens quit∣ted to the enetians. whose first Founder we read was Secrops, and arriving on the 20th of Sept. in Port Lione, he landed, and summoned the Town. The Greek Inhabi∣tants were presently inclined to a Surrender, but the Garrison consisting or about 400 Turks, retired into the Castle, giving out they would make a vigorous Defence, yet being daunted with the Approaches of the Christians, they also Capitulated: And now the General finding the Winter Season advancing, and his Forces much diminished by the many Detachments he had been obliged to make to Garrison so many conquered Places, he was constrained to lay aside the further Prosecution of his good Fortune, till he had received new Supplies of Men, and other Necessaries from Venice, which we leave him at present in expectation of. Thus we have seen two of the Tripple Confederacy acting their Parts, with equal Glory and Advantage to themselves, in Conformity to their Stipulations. Now we are to see what was done by the Third Ally, the Polander; who made great Preparations this Season to bombard Caminiec, which they exe∣cuted for 2 Days together, viz. The Last of Aug. and 1st of Sep. under the Command of Prince James, His Majesty of Poland's ldest Son, being accompanied by 2. Generals. Some Days be∣fore
it was resolved on in the King's Council, That the Forces should march towards that Fortress, and that not having been able to block it up, so as to famish it, they should, at least, use their utmost Endeavours to lay it desolate by a great Number of Bombs and Mortas. Prince James after having received these Orders, marched that way, and myested the Place, just as if he had a Design to lay a formar Siege to it. He found the Basha encamp'd without it, and hinding the Approaches by continual firing, by which means 25 or 30 Polanders were killed upon the Spot. Nevertheless Prince, James caused the Town to be batter'd, as we said, with the Cannon, and at the same time a World of Bombs were thrown into it, one of which set fie to the Basha's Hose. The Basha being acquainted with this, and that some Officers had ordered several People to go to extinguish the Fire, tho' they were appointed to attend other Business, he made Answer, That he had a great dea more to lose than a World of others, who could not be assisted while they were employ'd at his House: That they should only save his Stable, and that he was not concerned for the rest. In the mean while, he sent to entreat Prince James, to let him know where were his Quarters, and that he would hinder any firing that way; The Prince sent him back Word, That he was obli∣ged to him for his Civility; but that he had no fixed Quarters, and that he was every-where; as he judged necessary. And, in∣deed, in going and coming from one side to the other, there came a Cannon-Bullet that made its first bound so near him, that it covered him all over with Dust: He seemed not in any wise concerned, tho' this was his Tryal of Skill, which wonder∣fully pleased the Poles that were near his Person. He gave fur∣ther Instances of his Courage upon a Sally the Turks made a Moment after; and he had been the first to have made Head against them, if he had not been withheld. The Turks pre∣sently made an Onset upon the advanced Guard, and likewise caused a Squadron to buckle that came to its Succour: But a fresh Body of Polanders making up, they retreated in good Or∣der; the Poles were hindred from pursuing them far by some Pieces of Cannon charged with Chain-shot. In the mean while, the Serasquier, who had some time before put Succours into the Place, and who was still hovering there∣abouts to observe their Motions, had no sooner Notice of what had passed, but that he sent for a Body of Tartars that were at some distance, to come and join him immediately. This News being come to the King of Poland's Ears, who was ad∣vanced towards the Neister, to assist the Prince his Son in case of Need; he sent him Order to draw off his Troops from be∣fore Cammiec, and to come and join him. Prince James having hereupon informed the Two Generals of the King his Father's Pleasure, he gave a Discharge of all his Cannon by way of
Farewel, and having drawn them off, placed himself in their Rear. The Basha of Caminiec detach'd some Squadrons after him; but they contented themselves with giving certain To∣kens of Contempt and Derision at the late Enterprize. But for all this formal Bustle, the Damage done was inconsidera∣ble; insomuch, that some turn'd the Action into a handsome Ridicule, by saying, That the Bombs of the Christians had a se∣cret Vnderstanding with those of the Infidels, and so did them no harm. Having done with the Poles, it might be expected I should say something of the Muscovites; but you are to note, their time of Action is not come yet: 'Tis true, they took the Field with a very numerous Army, but returned Home without do∣ing any more than threaten the Tartars, and whose General Galtizen, to cover his own Credit, charged the Fault of all the Miscarriages of the Champaign upon Samuclowitz, General of the Loyal Cossacks, as being guilty of holding Correspondence with the Tartars, and whom for that Reason, or at least Pre∣tence, together with his Son he took into Custody, confiscated their Estates, and had them both carried Prisoners to Moscow; and I do not remember to have ever heard of them after∣wards. This Year was fatal to divers learned Persons, parti∣cularly, to Father Rapin, a most celebrated Critick, and a Per∣son very amed in the Commonwealth of Learning; to our great Mr. Waller, the most Famous Poet of the Age; to Mr. Francis Turretin of Geneva, a most Eminent Professor in Divinity; and to divers others of different Faculties and Quality. Now we are come to a Year of Wonders, wherein happen∣ed such Changes and Revolutions in the Face of Things with∣in the Confines of our European World, as can hardly be pa∣rallell'd in any Age whatever, since the Dissolution of the Ro∣man Empire. A mighty Monarch thrust from his Throne; A cruel War began in all the Parts almost of Europe; And a Way hahed out in the Course of the All-wise Providence of God, for the Rise of a Prince (who otherwise than as to his Personal Merits, was not so considerable in Power) so far as not only to attain to the Possession of 3 Crowns, but to become the Head of the most Serene Allies, not only in the Management of the War, but in the Prosecution and Accomplishment of the Peace that ensued, with equal Glory to himself, as Advantage to his Confederates; and its reasonably hoped will prove most of all so to his own Subjects. But to be a little more Particu∣lar, we shall begin with England first, before we enter upon new Accidents that happened Abroad, and the Operations of the various Campaigns, when we shall return to see how far, and in what manner they have affected our Nations, with whose Afair▪ we shall conclude as well as begin the Year.
I need not repeat what the Transactions of the last were a∣mongst us, nor how far the Dispensing Power was then car∣ried on, I shall therefore now proceed and shew, that as the King thought he had then laid a sufficient Foundation (tho' it proved but a very Sandy one) for his Designs,K. James his Declaration of Indul∣gence com∣manded to be Read in Churches. he proceeded now to shew how Absolute he would be in them, and there∣fore on the 4th of May, he passed an Order in Council, that his Declaration of Indulgence, should be Read in all Churches and Chappels, throughout England and Wales, in Time of Di∣vine Service, and that all the Bishops in their respective Dio∣cesses, should take Care to have the same accordingly per∣formed. There is no question to be made, but they under∣stood the King's Meaning well enough, and that under a Sha∣dow of Favour to be intended hereby to Protestant Dissenters, all the Good imaginable was meant to the Roman Catholicks; and that whatever was intended by it, there was no Good meant to them, nor their Church; and therefore it was their Business to ward off the Blow; which 7 of them endeavoured to do, in an humble Petition to the King, wherein their Rea∣sons were set forth, why they could not comply with the Or∣der of Council: But they were so cautious in the Matter, that after it was drawn up, they would let no other see it, before it was presented: And the same was, as also the King's Answer, to this Effect. TO THE KING'S Most Excellent MAJESTY, The Humble PETITION of William, Archbishop of Canterbury, and divers of the Suffragan Bishops of that Province, (now present with him,) in behalf of themselves, and others of their absent Brethren, and of the Inferior Clergy of their respective Diocesses. Humbly Sheweth, THAT the great Aversness they find in themselves to the Distributing and Publishing in all their Churches Your Majesty's late Declaration for Liberty of Conscience,The Bishops Petition. proceeds neither from any Want of Duty and Obedience to Your Majesty, (our holy Mother, the Church of England, be∣ing both in her Principles, and in her constant Practice, un∣questionably Loyal; and having, to her great Honour, been more than once publickly acknowledged to be so by Your Gra∣cious Majesty;) nor yet from any Want of Tenderness to
Dissenters; in relation to whom, we are willing to come to such a Temper as shall be thought fit, when the Matter shall be considered and settled in Parliament and Convocation: But, among many other Considerations, from this especially, Because that Declaration is founded upon such a Dispencing Power, as hath been often declared Illegal in Parliament; and particularly, in the Years 1662, and 1672, and in the Be∣ginning of Your Majesty's Reign; and is a Matter of so great Moment and Consequence to the whole Nation, both in Church and State, that Your Petitioners cannot, in Prudence, Honour or Conscience, so far make themselves Parties to it, as the Distribution of it all over the Nation, and the solemn Publication of it once and again, even in GOD's House, and in the Time of His Divine Service, must amount to in com∣mon and unreasonable Construction. Your Petitioners therefore most humbly and earnestly be∣seech Your Majesty, that You will be pleased not to insist up∣on their Distributing and Reading Your Majesty's said De∣claration. And Your Petitioners, as in Duty bound, shall ever pray, &c. Will. Cant. Will. Asaph. Fr. Ely, Jo. Cicestr. Tho. Bathon. & Wellen. Tho. Peterburgen. Jonath. Bristol. His MAJESTY'S ANSWER. I Have heard of this before,The King's Answer. but did not believe it. I did not ex∣pect this from the Church of England, especially from some of you. If I change my Mind, ye shall hear from me. If not, I ex∣pect my Command shall be obeyed. But how unpleasing soever the Petition might be to the King, which is sufficiently evinced by his Answer; and what Revenge soever he might ruminate within himself to take upon the Bi∣shops for it; the Chancellor, though he thought his Ecclsia∣stical Commission big enough to suspend the Bishop of Lon∣don, and the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, and to expel the Master and Fellows of Magdalen College in Oxford; yet, is seems, he did not believe it sufficient to suspend these Bishop: And therefore, it was said, he advised the King to Try them upon an Information of High-Treason, at the King's-Beneh-Bar: In order to this, they were committed Prisoner
to the Tower; and that on the Day before (I think) the Le∣gendary▪ Birth of the Prince of Wales, (who came to Town on Sunday Morning,The Bishops sent to the Tower, Try∣ed and Ac∣quitted. the 10th of June) that they might not have the Opportunity, as it was the Place, at least, of some of them, to be present thereat, and make any Inspection into that pious Fraud. But though the Nation was mightily alarm'd at their Commitment; and more particularly, with the Time and Circumstance of it, and that this Discontent might have been read in the Faces of almost all Men, ve Romanists; yet the Court, unconcerned, held on their Pace; and accordingly, the Bishops were Tryed in Trinity Term following, at the King's-Beneh-Bar, upon an Information of High-Misdemeanor, as aforesaid, for their Petition to the King. But how secure soever the King and his Chancellor thought themselves of the Judges; and though Sir Robert Wright, who was Chief Justice; and Sir Richard Allibone, a known Papist, were Two of them, yet they were not all of a Piece; for Mr. Justice Powell both learnedly and stoutly defended the Cause of the Bishops: And, though I believe the Jury of themselves, upon considering the Merit of the Cause, were sufficiently disposed to acquit them, as they did accordingly; yet surely, if they had done otherwise, I question whether all the King's Guards could have secured them from the Fury of the People, who were not a little chafed with these Proceedings; and wrought such Seeds of Discontent in the Minds of most Men, that after∣wards broke forth with a Witness. And though it is not to be doubted but the Great Men of our Nation began before this to look about them, and to have a watchful Eye upon every Motion of the Court; yet this awaken'd them to pur∣pose, to seek for a Remedy against the impending Evil, by such Methods, and from such Persons as were most interested to divert the Course of them. But of this, we shall more parti∣cularly speak hereafter; the Course of our History leading us  to the Prosecution of Foreign Affairs and Campaigns, ready to begin: And first, we shall again begin with Hungary. We left off last Year with the Surrender of Agria, a most pleasing Piece of News to the Imperial Court; as was that of the Fortress of Mngaz, early this Spring, no less grateful to it. Famine, and no other Reason, was the Occasion of the Surrender of this Place, as well as the preceding one. The Fortress had been held out by the Princess Ragotzi, Count Teceley's Lady, in a manner ever since the Beginning of the War: But now dire Necessity constrained that Noble Lady to surrender both it and her self into the Emperor's Hands; as it appear'd evidently, by her saying, when the Capitula∣tion was brought from Count Caraffa, to be signed by her,
Must I Sign my Husband's Death? For, I am perswaded, that as soon as the Turks come to know I have abandoned this Place, they will take off his Head. The Terms of the Surrendry were these: I. That the Emperor will grant a general Amnesty to the Princess Ragotzi, and to all those of her Party that are actually at Mongatz. II. She is to repair immediately to Vienna, with the Princes Ragotzi her Children by the first Bed: And she should be at Freedom there: But she is not to stir thence without the Em∣peror's Leave. III. All their Goods, Moveables, and Immoveables shall be restored to them, saving the Fortresses of Montgatz, and Mi∣clos, which should remain in his Imperial Majesty's Hands, until an absolute Discussion of his Rights to those Two Places, which are pretended to have been dismembred from the Crown of Hungary. IV. The Princess should be restored to the Possession of her Dowry, and of all the Goods that belong to her in the Succes∣sion of the late Prince Ragotzi, on the Score of her Matrimonial Covenants; and all the Moveable Effects should be restored to her, according to the Inventory that should be taken of them; and the Declaration she should confirm by her Oath; as also those of the Princes her Children, whose Tutelage should re∣main in the Emperor. V. She shall be obliged to deliver into the Hands of the Imperial Commissioners, the Standard, Bonnet, Sword, and Letters of Investiture of the Principality of Hungary, sent by the Grand Signior to Count Teckeley, and all his Moveable Ef∣fects, and those of the other Male-Contents. VI. She should also deliver up all the Cannon, Arms, and Ammunition that should be found in the Place. VII. All the Goods, moveable and immoveable should be restored to the Male-Contents that should be in Mongatz, and should accept of the Amnesty. Yet without this Article ex∣tending to those that should continue in the Rebellion; whose Goods should be Coniscated, saving 2 or 3 who are withdrawn into Poland, to whom the Emperor promises Pardon, upon the Princess's Recommendation. VIII. All the Hungarians that are in the Place should take an Oath of Fidelity, by which they shall oblige themselves, not to depart the Kingdom without the Emperor's Leave: And not have any Correspondence with Count Teckeley, upon Pain of being declared to have forfeited the Amnesty.
IX. His Imperial Majesty may dispose of the Garrisons of the Places belonging to the young Princes Ragotzi, and change them if he thinks expedient. X. The young Princes being under the Emperor's Tutelage, should be put into the Hands of those he should appoint for their Education. XI. Neither the Princess, nor any other should be permit∣ted to send Notice to Count Teckeley of the Surrender of Mon∣gatz, he being to be reputed as civilly dead. XII. It should be free for all those that were in the Place, to withdraw whither they should think fitting, without the Imperialists being obliged to furnish Carriages, save to the Princess, who should have them provided for her, with a Con∣voy, and number of Servants suitable to her Quality. Alba Regalis being reduced also to the same Straits,Alba Regalis surrendred to the Ger∣mans. the ve∣ry same Fate attended it as Mongatz; for, on the 8th of May, the Garrison being unwilling to conflict any longer with the great Necessities they had been so long exposed to, and still daily multiplied upon them, did, in spight of the 3 Basha's, their Commanders, resolve to Capitulate, and projected the Articles upon one of the principal Towers of that City; and in pursuance of the Agreement made, they marched out, to the Number of 5000 Men, of whom about 2000 were Soldi∣ers; and were convoyed to the Danube in Waggons, and thence in Boats to Belgrade. These Two important Places being put into the Emperor's Power,Lippa besie∣ged and ta∣ken by the Imperialists. and Things once more amicably settled with the Tran∣sylvanians, Count Caraffa, while the main Army was drawing together, had Leisure to reduce Lippa: And the more to amuse the Garrison, he caused a Report to be spread abroad, That the Season being now so far spent, he had Orders to repair immediately to Esseck: But he quickly after sent a Detachment of 1000 Horse, under the Command of Count Veterani, to invest the Place; yet could not hinder the Aga's of Temeswaer and Jeno to enter into it with a Reinforment of 1500 Men, which made the Siege so much the more difficult: However, the Cannon and Mortars of the Besiegers began to play on the 16th of June in the Morning, in order to make Breaches, and that with good Success, and burnt abundance of Houses, the greatest Part of the Town being Wooden Buildings; and a Breach being made large enough to give an Assault, it was resolved it should be immediately performed, that the Turks might have no Leisure to come to themselves, and use due Prevention. The Detachments appointed for this Work, be∣ing animated by the Presence of their Leaders, fell on with
much Courage and Eagerness; and, notwithstanding all the stubborn Opposition of the Besieged, they drove them back, and made themselves Masters of the Breach; while the Sieur de Vaubonne, who commanded the Granadeers, made also a second Attack on the side of the River, with the like Suc∣cess: So that the Imperialists entring the Town both ways, they cut in pieces the greatest part of those they found in Arms, while the rest made their escape into the Castle; which, though they at first made a Shew of Defending, yet they were forced to surrender the same on the 21st, at Dis∣cretion. This was no sooner accomplished,Illock and Peter-Wa∣radin de∣serted by the Turks. but Illock was thought on, as fit and necessary to be reduced, before the Siege of Bel∣grade were formed: But the Turks did not think fit to stay for the coming of Count Caprara; and therefore, having first set fire to the Town, they entirely abandoned it; as they did also Peter-Waradin; whereby the Imperialists found themselves Masters of the Danube, as far as Belgrade; and having nothing more to fear from any Garrison, which they left behind them, they directed their March, under the Conduct of the Elector Bavaria, (the Duke of Lorain being sick,) that way. On the 4th of Aug. they set forward from Salankemen, and came on the 7th within sight of that part of the Danube that forms the Islands of Zingari; which, notwithstanding the Opposition made by the Turks, they passed; and on the 9th the whole Army, with the Artillery and Baggage, were encamped on the farther-Shoar, within 4 Leagues of Belgrade; where the Elector was informed, that there was a Garrison of 15000 Turks and Tartars in the City, but without any Certainty; and that the Ottoman Army lay near, to cover the Place: But the Elector advancing, found that the Turks had abandoned their Camp, and had set the Suburbs, or Lower Town, on fire: And about 4000 Greeks and Radziens, with their Wives and Children, came to implore His Electoral Highness Pro∣tection; who gave very strict Orders that none should mo∣lest them. Upon the Day of their Arrival before the Place,Belgrade besieged by the Impe∣rialists. the Elector caused the Trenches to be opened against the Upper Town and Castle; and he dispatched an Express to Vienna, to give the Emperor an Account of the State of Things. The next Day, being the 12th, in the Evening, the Troops began to approach towards the Castle, and take their Posts; to hinder which, the Enemy made a vigorous Sally; but they were at last repulsed, with a greater Loss to them, than to the Chri∣stians; Insomuch, that the Latter secured their Posts, and opened their Trenches within Musquet-shot of the Walls, and began to work on 2 Batteries. On the 13th the Turks made
a greater Sally, with much the same Success; and next Day they play furiously with their Cannon, and threw a great Quantity of Granadoes and Bombs, which did no great Exe∣cution, no more than did another Sally they-made. But a Detachment of the Garrison of Temeswaer, which the same Day, by the Help of Boats, got into the Castle, some what heighten'd their Courage, but it did not at all daunt the Be∣siegers, who carried on their Works; and on the 17th, by Break of Day, they began to bater the Walls of the Castle with 6 Pieces of Cannon; when they understood by a Deser∣ter▪ that the Enemy were hard at work in their Mines. The Workmen of the Besiegers, by the 17th, carried on the Trench∣es within 10 Paces of the Ditch, tho' not without great Loss of Men; and then they began to raise 2 new Batteries. The next Day they possessed themselves of a Mosque, on the Brink of the Ditch: And the Day following they drew 2 Parallel Lines on the Right and Left, to compass a greater Space of Ground, as well on the side of the Castle, as the Town; and made 2 Redoubts to support the Heads of them; which were performed, in spight of all the Opposition made by the Enemy. On the 22th, the Besiegers having perfected their Works, the great Cannon and Mortars arrived from Buda; and on the Day following they battered the Castle very fu∣riously, made divers Breaches, and beat down part of the Fortifications: And although the Turks made a Sally, with an Intent to attack the Redoubts, they were beaten back again with great Loss. Now it was, that the assured News was brought into the Camp, that the Prince of Baden had killed 3000 of the Enemy; and that the Turks had set fire to, and abandoned Grandisca, Debitza and Jesnewitz; as also, that General Veterani had taken Carensebes, and the strong Castle of Salancar. The Cannon still played furiously, with great Slaughter on both sides; when on the 24th a Letter was brought and presented to the Elector of Bavaria, from Os∣man, Basha of Aleppo; the Tenure whereof, together with His Electoral Highness's Answer, take as follows.
Osman, Basha's LETTER, to the Elector of Bavaria. HOnour of Princes, believing in Jesus, Chosen among the most Noble of the Christian Nation, Pattern of Magnificence, Possessor of all Splendor, Duke of Bavaria, and Chief General of the Roman Empire, Maximilian, whose Ways be prosperous; after Salutation, be it known unto you, That the most Serene, Great and Mighty Ottoman Emperor, Mo∣narch of the World, our Lord, having sent with His Serene Letter, to the greatest of the Christian Kings, the most Se∣rene Emperor, one of His Well-deserving Servants Sulficar Effundi, Adorned with several High Degrees of Honour, whose Praise be increased, and the present Drugerman of the Renowned Port, a Mirror of the Nobles of the Christian Worship, Alexander, whose Ways end happy. They are arrived here, and because they are going to You, and ac∣cording to Ancient and Laudable Custom, have need for Themselves, and a Hundred Persons, of Pass-ports and Safe∣guards to be sent from Your Army, this Our present Letter is Written and Dispatched unto You. After the Receipt whereof, We hope that Pass-ports, and some People for a Safe∣guard, will be sent hither, that the above-mentioned may, as They are Commanded, repair to you. They will, upon their coming near, (GOD willing) send again to You, to the End a Convoy may come from Your Army to meet and receive them from the Basha, sent with some Troops from hence, that so the Respect and Safety of Ambassadors, observed by all Nations, as is fit and necessary, may remain in its An∣cient Lustre; therefore You know how careful both sides ought to be of their safe Passage. For the rest, Prosperity be to those that shall follow the True Direction. Given in Our Army, near Nissa. Signed, Osman, Basha of Aleppo. To this Letter the Elector of Bavaria, after some consulting of the Matter in Council with the Chief Officers of the Ar∣my, returned this following Answer:
Maximilian Emanuel, &c. To Osman, Basha, Greeting, &c. WE have received the Letter You sent Us from the Camp, near Nissa, where You give Us to understand, That an Ambassador, by Name Sulficar Effundi, and the first Drugger-man, have Orders from Your Emperor to come to Our Army: Now, although we being inclin'd to Military Actions, might well refuse their coming hither; or which, none could take amiss, in the present Juncture of Affairs, might put it off till another time, since We do judge their Proposals will little agree with Our present Intentions; yet, being moved by a Christian Compassion, We do grant that They may come to Our Army, and We will favourably Hear what Your Emperor has Commanded them to Propose unto Us; for which Purpose, We have Commanded that a Pass∣port be prepared for their Security, and delivered to the Person that brought Us your Letter: We have likewise gi∣ven Order to the Commandant of Semendria, that in the Manner directed him, and with a sufficient Number of Troops, he Conduct them safely to Our Army, upon which they may firmly rely. Given in Our Camp, near Belgrade, &c. Though some Paces were made on both sides towards a Treaty in pursuance of these Letters, and the Passports were sent to the Turkish Ambassadors to come and negotiate the same, they did not succeed: But this we shall have occasion to men∣tion hereafter; and therefore we shall pursue the Siege, and observe, that the Besiegers, on the 25th, possess'd themselves of another Mosque of great use to them, because of its con∣venient Situation, near into which the Besieged sprung a Mine on the 27th, as they did another next Day, with a Design to ruine the Christians Works; which, though it blew up short, yet the Blow occasioned great Disorder, and this was much encreased by one of the Besieged's Bombs setting Fire to se∣veral Quintals of Powder, that blew up 7 or 8 Men that were on the Battery. On the 29th the Elector sent a Captain, with an Interpreter, who was a Greek, to summon the Go∣vernour to surrender; who was so enraged with it, that he imprisoned the former, and hanged the latter; so that the Siege went on the 30th, and following Days of Sept. with won∣derful Vigour shewed on both sides; yet so, that the Besie∣gers,
by plying their Batteries and springing their Mines, made such Breaches both in the City and Castle, and filled the Ditch to that degree, by the Second of Sept. at Night that it was concluded, seeing the Besieged obstinarely declined to return an Answer to the forementioned Summons, and that the Place was now santable, no time should be lost in carrying it on with the utmost Vigour; so that the 3d, 4th and 5th being spent in battering the remaining Works, facilitating the Ascent, and giving the necessary Orders; on the 6th the General Assault was given, when the Soldiers boldly mounted the Breach, where the Besieged, with great Resolution, made an Obstinate Resistance, and defended the same with so much Vigour,Belgrade taken by Storm. that the Besiegers were twice heaten off. But the Elector who was himself, in all Places of imminent Danger, did so animate the Officers and Soldiers upon the 3d Assault, that the Besieged finding all their Efforts in vain, began to lose Courage, and by Degrees to retire, and fled into the Castle; yet the Besiegets now entring (like a Torrent, and passing on with great, Fury, entred Pell-mell with them, and put all they met to the Sword: Not could the Riches any offered, prevail to the saving of their Lives; which the Basha perceiving, he caused 300 Christian Slaves to be brought chained together, which he placed before the retiring Turks  such a Manner, that they must have received the Shot made at the Enemy, in Compassion to whom the Soldiers stopped in the Heat of Blood, and the Elect or commanded that Quarter should be given: Whereupon about 500 Turks, that under the Favour of this Stratagem had saved themselves, together with the Basha Governour, and two other Basha's, submitted, and were made Prisoners of War; the first of whom falling prostrate before the Elector, entreated, he might not be made a Prison∣er. But he was answered, That he should experience the Christi∣ans used their Prisoners better than the Turks used to do and, That he should be sent to the Emperor 31 at which he seemed ex∣treamly pleased. And thus the famous City of Belgrade ell into the Hands of the Christians in the Space of 22 Days, and by its Reduction opened a Way into all the Turkish Dominions that were considerable in Europe, as was manifested in a great: measure the succeeding Campaign, yet this Felicity was o no long Duration.The Battel of Brod. But before this Seige was entirely compleat∣ed, the Imperial Arms under the Conduct of Prince Lewis of Baden, met with another extraordinary and unexpected Piece of Success in Bosnia, which was in the following Manner. The Prince upon the 4th of Nov. having Notice that 4 or 5000 Turks were Encamped about 6 Miles from Brod, he marched with 3000 Horse and Dragoons all Night to encounter them; but in the Morning to his no small Surprize, he found himself
greatly misinformed as to the Number, which amounted to 15000 Horse and Foot, under the Command of the Basha of that Country. However, calling the Officers about him, he told them it was to no Purpose to think of retreating, as being too late, by reason of their too far Engagement among the Enemy, but that they must now fight for their Lives and Victory, which was chearfully consented to: However, before they had well put themselves into a Fighting Posture, the Turks had surrounded them, and vigorously charged them 4 or 5 times, which was sustained with so many brave and bold Returns, that the Turkish Horse perceiving themselves over set fell first into Disorder and then to open Flight, leaving the Foot to shift for themselves, whose Ranks being forced by the Imperial Horse breaking in upon them, they were mise∣rably beaten down and slain to the Number in all of 15000 and 200 made Prisoners, with 36 Colours and the Baggage taken. Now we shall take our leave of Hungary and those Parts, and cross over to Venice, where we find the Doge Marco, An∣tonio Goustintano departed this Life, March 28, this Year, after, the Solemnity of whose Burial the Senate assembled in order to the Choice of a new Prince, which unanimously fell upon Cap∣tain General Morosmi then in the Levant, to whom they im∣mediately sent the Ducal Cap by a Secretary, with a Letter to this Purpose. The Senate of Venice's LETTER to the New Doge. THAT whereas the most Serene Marquess Giustiniano, a Prince of good and glorious Memory, is by the Dis∣position of the most High, called away from hence to his ever∣lasting Rest; the usual Councils were thereupon called to∣gether, in order to chuse a Successor according to our Laws; the Four Electors being thereupon Assembled, and having called upon the Name of the Holy Ghost, they have cast their Eyes upon your Serenity; and well weighed the special Gifts and Qualifications that adorn you, from whose Courage and Conduct our Republick hath already received so great and weighty Services in several of the chiefest Employments, particularly that of Captain-General of the Seas, in which you have this third time so worthily acquitted your self; they have thereupon unanimously chosen you this Day with ge∣neral Joy and Satisfaction, to be the Prince and Chief of our Republick.
We are extreamly satisfied to see your Serenity raised into that Employment and Dignity, which was most justly due to your Worth and Vertue; and do congratulate thereupon with our selves and with your Serenity, under whose happy Conduct and Influence we hope to see the Affairs and Interest of our Republick grow and flourish every Day. We assure ourselves, that your Serenity shall be willing to continue where you are, as we have judged it necessary you should, during this Conjuncture, till we shall otherwise order; and that you through your natural Foresight, Prudence and Zeal, will apply your self in procuring those Advantages for our Republick, as you in your High Wisdom shall think most conducible for the Common Good, for your own Glory and the Honour of your Country; In the mean time, we shall co-operate all we can in bringing to Perfection any of your Weighty Enterprizes, and Perfectly agree with you the Head of our Republick to support you, as you must do it; which our Secretary Luccato shall more fully unfold to your Serenity, whom we have sent to bring you this, with the Ducal Bon∣net, and to whom you may give full Credit, and so praying the Divine Majesty to preserve your Serenity with long Life, we take leave, and are, &c. There were also the following Instructions given to the said Secretary. First, That the said Secretary should carry the Ducal Bon∣net to the Army, and shall have 700 Ducats for his Journey, and 100 Ducats a Month for his Incidental Charges. 2dly, His Serenity may use any Solemn Rejoycings upon this or any other Occasion, and shall use the Leaden Seal of the Senate. 3dly, That all Letters hence shall be addressed to our most Serene Prince Francisco Morosini, the Seigniory of Venice, &c. wisheth Health. 4thly, That Two Councellors shall attend the Doge, and have each 900 Ducats for their Advance, and 300 Ducats a Month for their Maintenance. 5thly, Each shall have a Gally to attend him during the Cam∣paign, and which shall precede next that of his Serenity. 6thly, Two Councellors and one Chief of the Council of 40 shall live in the Palace of the Doge, who shall have 500 Du∣cats a Month, and Entertainment, and shall act and do as the Doge may do, receiving his Revenues, defraying his Charges, and reserving what shall be due to him till he returns.
But as if Fortune had been now glutted in heaping up of her favours upon Morosini, by adding to the many Victories and Conquests he had made, the highest Dignity his Coun∣try could confer upon him, he did nothing that was memo∣rable this Campaign, (having been beyond most Mens expecta∣tions, extreamly baffled in the Enterprize he undertook upon Negropont) nor indeed ever after this, comparatively to the great feats he had done in the preceding part of his life; So that besides the taking of Chir in Dalmatia, by Ge∣neral Cornare, about the beginning of Sept. and that small Victory which the Albanians (who had now put themselves under the protection of the Republick) got over some thou∣sands of Turks,The Affairs of Venice and Poland. Commanded by the Basha of Scutari, and their taking the Town of Maduna thereupon there was no∣thing else of any great consideration that fell out on that side. And as for Poland, he that can find any thing extraor∣dinary there (for the breaking up of the Diet held at Grod now this Year, in Confusion, and the Incursion of the Turks into the Province of Pocusia, I do not take to be such) let him do it, and I shall pass on to somewhat of greater Moment. Now it may be remembred in what uncertain state and im∣minent danger we left both the Civil and Religious Rights of Britain; there were some concurring causes that made those of Europe appear to be little less so. France by the Interval of the Peace was grown wonderfully potent, and if the Alter∣cations between the Imperial and French Ministers about the later's Fortifying of Traerback foreboded no good to the Em∣pire, the Death of the Elector of Cologn, which hapned June 2d. this year, manifestly tended to an open Rupture; The two Candidates for the Electorate were young Prince Clement of Bavaria, the Elector's Brother of that Name, whose in∣terest was supported by Germany; and the Cardinal de Fus∣temburg, whose pretentions were backed by the Crown of France. But though the former made a shift to carry it, and that his Election was confirmed afterwards by the Pope, who was at no good terms with France at this time; yet the French K. concerned himself so far in the matter, as to make it an occa∣sion to begin the cruellest War that ever happn'd in this part of the world, & this was seconded with a Manifesto from the French K (which indeed, in the right course of things, should have been first) setting forth the Justice of his cause; But I hope the world is still at liberty to believe as little of it as they please; How∣ever it cost Germany this Season besides the incredible sums paid, for Contribution, no less than the loss of the Fortress of Phillipsbourg, taken by the Dauphine in Person, Manheim, Spire, Mentz, Creusenack, Baccarack, Heidelburg and several o∣ther places as far as Hailbron, besides Bonn secured by the Cardinal de Furstemburg towards the beginning of the dispute
about the Election. But before all this happened, and even soon after the foresaid Elector's Death, there was an inter∣view and even a long Conference held at Minden in Westphali, between the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg, the Land∣grave of Hesse Cassell, the Princes of the) House of Lunemburg, and the P. of Orange; under pretence of the Affair of Cologn, as it was in part, but much more about concerting methods to divert the Storm hanging over our British Isle, without disjoynting of which from the French interest, and securing of its Religion and Liberties, there was but little likelihood of preserving the rest of Europe, and confining France to the Bounds set unto it by former Stipulations and Treaties. The Consequence of this Interview, was, the making mighty Preparations in Holland, both by Sea and Land, with∣out any visible Appearance who they designed to make War upon: And tho' it was said the Heer Van Citters, the States Ambassador at London, assured the King, England had nothing to fear from it; and did insinuate, that France had much more Reason to be allarm'd than he: the Design was pene∣trated into another way. Mr. Skelton, while Ambassador in Holland, had gained some Glimmering of it, by the Interception of some Letters to a certain Person in the Family of the Princess of Orange: But being soon after sent in the same Quality to France, he got a much clearer Light thereof from one Verace, a Genevese by Birth; The Story whereof is such as deserves a more particular Recital. This same Person had been formerly Captain of the Guard to the Prince of Orange; but happening to kill a Man in a Duel, he was put out of his Master's Favour: However Mr. Skelton found a Way, by the Interest of the Earl of Clarendon, who had bred up his Son, my Lord Cornbury, at Geneva, and was obli∣ged to Verace for many Services he had done him there, to make his Peace again. The Genevese being thus re-establish∣ed in his Master's Favour, he had a greater Share of it than ever; and was more particularly intimate with Monsieur Ben∣tink, the Prince's Favourite. I could never learn how he put himself out a second time; But so it was, that he withdrew and was upon his Journey to Geneva, when, upon the Noise of the Preparations in Holland, he writ to Mr. Skelton, then at Paris, that he had something to communicate to the King, his Master, that concerned nothing less than his Crown, and to let him know a Son-in-Law, whom he was not mistrustful enough of. But for the rest, he would not ex∣plicate the Secret to any other than the King himself, if he were pleased to send him Orders to come and wait upon him. Upon this, Mr. Skelton, writ several Letters to England, but did not receive an Answer suitable to the Occasion; which made both himself and the French Court much concer∣ned
at it. Yet, when they had, in a manner, entirely ac∣quiesced, and left the King to take his own Measures, since he seemed to reject theirs, and the Assistances offered him, it hapned one Day, that Monsieur de Croissi being in Discourse with Mr. Skelton, and interrogating of him concerning the then State of Things in England; the other answered, He had nothing more to do in the Matter, and durst not inter meddle any farther: But added, That he believed if the Most Christian King would order his Ambassador to declare to the States the Part he took in the Affairs of the King, his Master; and to threat∣en to attack them, in case they attempted any thing against him; that he would quickly put a Stop to them, and break the Measures of the Prince of Orange thereupon, &c. Monsieur de Croissi took the Proposal presently; and he no sooner acquainted the King with it, but he sent Orders to the Count d' Avaux, to acquaint the States-General with his Mind: And this oc∣casioned the following Memorial, and unravelled the Mystery of Skelton's being recalled, and sent Prisoner to the Tower, for discovering the King's Secrets. My Lords, THE sincere Desire the King, my Master, has to maintain the Tranquility of Europe, will not suffer His Majesty to see the great Preparations for War, both by Sea and Land, made by Your Lordships, without taking the Measures that Prudence (the continual Companion of all His Actions) inspires Him with, to prevent the Mischiefs these War-like Preparations will certainly draw after them. And although the King, perswaded of the Wisdom of Your Coun∣sels, would not imagine that a Free State should so easily resolve to take up Arms, and to kindle a War, which, in the present Juncture, cannot but be fatal to all Christendom: Nevertheless, His Majesty cannot believe Your Lordships would engage Your Selves in so great Expences, both at home and abroad, to entertain in Pay so many Foreign Troops, to put to Sea so numerous a Fleet so late in the Year, and to prepare so great Magazins, if You had not a Design formed, answerable to the Greatness of these Preparations. All these Circumstances, and many others that I may not here produce, perswade the King, my Master, with Reason, that this Ar∣ming threatens England: Wherefore His Majesty hath commanded me to declare to You, on His part, That the Bands of Friendship and Alliance between him and the King of Great Britain, will oblige Him, not only to assist him, but also to look on the first Act of Hostility that shall be committed by Your Troops, or Your Fleet, against His Majesty of Great Britain, as a manifest Rupture of the Peace, and a Breach with His Crown.
I leave it to Your Lordships Prudence to reflect on the Conse∣quences that such Actions may have, His Majesty not having or∣dered me to make You this Declaration on His Part, without His sincere Intention to prevent (as I have already had the Honour to tell You) all that may trouble the Peace of Europe. Given at the Hague, Septemb. 9 1688. But for all this, Things were in England in the utmost Dis∣order and Security; all that ever the King or Country could do, could not keep the Army within any tolerable Bounds: And tho' there was so great a Storm gathering in Holland; yet so stupid were the Popish Drivers, that nothing would serve them but filling the Army with Irish Men, who were likely still to be more disorderly, and more hated. But this was vi∣gorously opposed by Lieutenant-Colonel Beaumont, and other Officers in the Duke of Berwick's Regiment. The former in the name of the rest, making the following speech to the Duke upon the occasion. Sir, I am desired by these Gentlemen (with whose Sense I concur) to inform your Grace, that we don't think it consistent with our Honours to have Foreigners imposed upon us, without being complain'd of, that, our Companies were weak, or Orders to recruit them; not doubting but if such Orders had been given us, We that first in very ill times raised them Hundreds, could easily now have made them according to the Kings Complement: We humbly Petition, we may have leave to fill up our Companies with such men of our Na∣tion we may judge most suitable for the Kings Service, and to sup∣port our Honours; or that we may be permitted, with all imagi∣nable Duty and Respect, to lay down our Commissions. Of this an Account was forthwith transmitted to the King, then at Windsor; who immediately ordered a Party of Horse down to Portsmouth, to bring them up in Custody, and a Court-Marshal was ordered to proceed against them: And if the Memorial of the French Ambassador had not come in, that very Morning, to shew them their Danger, they had, in all probability, lost their Lives for it; but now they contented themselves with only casheering of them. By this time there was certain Intelligence brought, that the Preparations in Holland were designed against England: And the King, in his Proclamation of the 28th of Sept. gave convincing Proofs, that himself believed it; and so he ordered new Levies to be made, and began to turn Cat in an, by declaring in Council, Octb. 2d that he would restore the Charter of the City of London. And the Ministers were by this time become so sensible of their Danger, that they procured a General Par∣don.
On Wednesday, October the 3d. the Archbishop of Canter∣bury,̄̄ and the Bishops of London, Winchester, St. Asaph, Ely, Chi∣chester, Rochester, Bath and Wells, and Peterborough, all in a Body waited upon the King, when the Archbishop spoke thus to him. May it please Your Sacred Majesty, WHen I had lately the Honour to wait upon you, you were pleased briefly to acquaint me with what had passed two days before between your Majesty and these my Reverend Brethren: by which, and by the Account which they themselves gave me, I perceived, that in truth, there passed nothing, but in very general Terms and Expressions of your Majesties gracious and favoura∣ble Inclinations to the Church of England, and of our reciprocal Duty and Loyalty to your Majesty:The Bishop of Bath & VVells Both which were sufficiently understood and declared before; and (as one of my Brethren then told you) would have been in the same state, if the Bishops had not stir'd one foot out of their Diocesses. Sir, I found it grie∣ved my Lords the Bishops to have come so far, and to have done so little; and I am assured they came then prepared to have given your Majesty some more particular Instances of their Duty and Zeal for your Service, had they not apprehended from some words which fell from your Majesty, That you were not then at leisure to receive them. It was for this Reason that I then besought your Majesty to command us once more to attend you all together, which your Ma∣jesty was pleased graciously to allow and encourage. We therefore are here now before you, with all Humility to beg your Permission, that we may suggest to your Majesty such Advices as we think proper at this Season, and conducing to your Service, and so leave them to your Princely Consideration. Which the King being graciously pleased to permit, the Archbishop proceeded as followeth. I. Our first humble Advice is, That your Majesty will be gra∣ciously pleased to put the Management of your Government, in the se∣veral Counties, into the Hands of such of the Nobility and Gentry there, as are legally qualified for it. II. That your Majesty will be graciously pleased to annul your Commission for Ecclesiastical Affairs; and that no such Court, as that Commission sets up, may be erected for the future. III. That your Majesty will graciously be pleased, That no Dis∣pensation may be granted or continued, by Virtue whereof, any per∣son not duly qualified by Law, hath been, or may be put into any Place, Office, or Preferment in Church or State, or in the Vni∣versities, or continued in the same, especially such as have Cure of Souls annexed to them; and in particular, that you will be graciously pleased to restore the President and Fellows of St. Ma∣ry Magdalen College in Oxford.
IV. That your Majesty will graciously be pleased to set aside all Licenses or Faculties already granted, by which any persons of the Romish Communion may pretend to be enabled to teach Publick Schools; and that no such be granted for the future. V. That your Majesty will be graciously pleased to desist from the Exercise of such a Dispensing Power, as hath of late been used; and to permit that Point to be freely and calmly debated and argu∣ed, and finally setled in Parliament. VI. That your Majesty will be graciously pleased to inhibit the four Foreign Bishops, who stile themselves Vicars Apostolical, from further invading the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction which is by Law vested in the Bishops of this Church. VII. That your Majesty will be pleased graciously to fill the va∣cant Bishopricks, and other Ecclesiastical Promotions within your Gift, both in England and Ireland, with men of Learning and Piety; and in particular (which I must own to be my pecular boldness, for 'tis done without the privity of my Brethren) That you will be graciously pleased forthwith to fill the Archiepiscopal Chair of York (which has so long stood empty, and upon which a whole Province depends) with some very worthy Person; For which (pardon me, Sir, if I am bold to say) you have now here be∣fore you a very fair Choice. VIII. That your Majesty will be graciously pleased to supersede all further Prosecution of Quo Warranto's against Corporations, and to restore to them their ancient Charters, Priviledges, and Franchises, as we hear God hath put into your Majesties Heart to do for the City of London, which we intended to have made other∣wise one of our principal Requests. IX. That if it please your Majesty, Writs may be issued out with convenient speed for the calling of a free and regular Parlia∣ment, in which the Church of England may be secured according to the Acts of Unformity; Provision may be made for a due Liberty of Conscience, and for securing the Liberties and Proper∣ties of all your Subjects; and a mutual Confidence and good Vnder∣standing may be established between your Majesty and all your People. X. Above all, That your Majesty will be graciously pleased to permit your Bishops to offer you such Motives and Arguments as (we trust) may, by God's Grace, be effectual to perswade your Majesty to return to the Communion of the Church of England, in∣to whose most holy Catholick Faith you were baptized, and in which you were educated, and to which it is our daily earnest Prayer to God, that you may be re-united. These, Sir, are the humble Advices, which out of Conscience of the Duty we owe to God, to your Majesty, and to our Country, We think fit at this time to offer to your Majesty, as suitable to the pre∣sent State of your Affairs, and most conducing to your Service; and so to leave them to your Princely Consideration. And we heartily beseech Almighty God, in whose hand the Hearts of all Kings are, so to dispose and govern yours, that in all your
Thoughts, Words and Works, you may ever seek his Honour and Glory, and study to preserve the People committed to your Charge, in Wealth, Peace and Godliness, to your own both temporal and eternal Happiness. Amen. We do heartily concur H. London. P. Winchester. VV. Asaph. W. Cant. Fran. Ely. Jo. Cicestr. Tho. Roffen. Tho. Bath & VVells. Tho. Petriburg. And because the King would seemingly remove all Jealou∣sies from the Church of England, he, on the 5th of Oct. de∣clared, that he would dissolve the Commission for Ecclesia∣cal Causes; and gave Directions to the Lord Chancellor ac∣cordingly, to cause the same to be forthwith done: But, at the same, it was not declared to be illegal; which was the only Way to give Satisfaction in respect of it. And because Magdalen College in Oxford was no less aggrieved with the High Commission than the Bishops themselves were, the King, after having Oct. 12th declared his Resolution to preserve the Church of England in all its Rights and Immunities, did, as an Evidence of it, signifie his Pleasure to the Bishop of Winchester, as Visitor of the said College, to settle the College Regularly and Statutably. Who accordingly, on the 16th caused a Citation to be fixed on the College Gate, to re-call Dr. Hough, and the former Fellows of that Society, by the 2d of Nov. following; and the Bishop went down ac∣cordingly to re-instate them, and was received with abun∣dance of Joy. But pray mind the Temper of this King; For an Account coming that very Post, that the Dutch Fleet had suffered very much in a Storm on the 16th of the same Month. N. S. and that they would hardly be able to sail till the Spring, the Bishop was re-called to London, and the Restitu∣tion deferred. Yet soon after, that false News being contra∣dicted, the Affection to the Church revived, and so the Busi∣ness of the College was effected on the 24th of the said Month. About this time the Queen-Dowager, and others, that at∣tended at the Queen's Delivery; as also the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, and divers Peers of the Land, were or∣dered to attend, to hear what the former could say concer∣ning the Birth of the pretended Prince of WALES. But now all Men's Tongues were let loose against the Government; And my Lord Sunderland's being dismissed from his Office of prime Minister and Secretary of State made a mighty Noise. That my Lord is a person of vast ability is a matter not to be doubted, and that how various soever the reports then & since have been concerning the cause of his being laid aside, I
think it's good manners for us to listen to the account he was pleased to give himself in his Letter of March, 23d 1689. which will fall pertinently in this place. The Earl of Sunderland's Letter to a Friend in London, published March 23d. 1689. TO comply with what you desire, I will explain some things which we talked of before I left England. I have been in a Station of a great noise, without Power or Advantage whilst I was in it, and to my Ruin now I am out of it. I know I cannot Justifie my self by saying, though it is true, that I thought to have prevented much Mischief; for when I found that I could not, I ought to have quitted the Service; Neither is it an Excuse that I have got none of those things which usually engage men in publick Affairs: My Quality is the same it ever was, and my Estate much worse, even ruin'd, tho' I was born to a very considerable one, which I am ashamed to have spoiled, though not so much as if I had encreased it by indirect Means. But to go on to what you expect: The Pretence to a Dispensing Power being not only the first thing which was much disliked since the Death of the late King, but the Foundation of all the rest, I ought to begin with that which I had so little to do with, that I never heard it spoken of till the time of Monmouth's Rebel∣lion, when that the King told some of the Council, of which I was one, that he was resolved to give Employments to Ro∣man Catholicks, it being fit that all Persons should serve who could be useful, and on whom he might depend. I think every Body advised him against it, but with little effect, as was soon seen: That Party was so well pleased with what the King had done, that they persuaded him to mention it in his Speech at the next Meeting of the Parliament, which he did, after many Debates whether it was proper or not: In all which I opposed it, as is known to very considerable Per∣sons, some of which were of another Opinion; for I thought it would engage the King too far, and it did give such Of∣fence to the Parliament, that it was thought necessary to prorogue it; after which, the King fell immediately to the sup∣porting the Dispensing Power, the most Chinerical thing that was ever thought of, and must be so till the Government here is as Absolute is in Turkey, all Power being included in that one. This is the Sense I ever had of it, and when I heard Lawyers defend it; I never changed my Opinion or Language; how∣ever it went on, most of the Judges being for it, and was the chief Business of the State, till it was looked on as set∣tled▪ Then the Ecclesiastical Court was set up, in which
there being so many considerable Men of several kinds, I could have but a small part; and that after Lawyers had told the King it was Legal, and nothing like the High Commis∣sion Court, I can most truly say, and it is well known, that for a good while I defended Magdalen College prely by Care and Industry, and have hundreds of times begged of the King never to grant Mandates, or to change any thing in the regular Course of Ecclesiastical Affairs, which he often thought reasonable, and then by perpetual Importunities was prevailed upon against his own Sense, which was the very Case of Magdalen College, as of some others. These things which I endeavoured, though without Suc∣cess, drew upon me the Anger and Ill will of many about the King. The next thing to be tried, was to take off the Penal Laws and the Tests, so many having promised their Concur∣rence towards it, that His Majesty thought it feasible; but he soon found it was not to be done by that Parliament, which made all the Catholicks desire it might be dissolv'd, which I was so much against, that they complained of me to the King, as a Man who ruined all his Designs by opposing the only thing could carry them on; Liberty of Conscience being the Foundation on which he was to build. That it was first offered at by the Lord Clifford, who by it had done the work, even in the late King's time, if it had not been for his weak∣ness, and the weakness of his Ministers; Yet I hindred the Dissolution several Weeks, by telling the King that the Par∣liament in Being would do every thing he could desire, but the taking off the Penal Laws and the Tests, or the allowing his Dispensing Power, and that any other Parliament, tho such a one could be had as was proposed, would probably never repeal those Laws; and if they did, they would cer∣tainly never do any thing for the support of the Government, whatever exigency it might be in. At that time the King of Spain was sick, upon which I said often to the King, That if he should die, it would be impossible for His Majesty to pre∣serve the Peace of Christendom, that a War must be expect∣ed, and such a one as would chiefly concern England; and that if the present Parliament continued, he might be sure of all the Help and Service he could wish; but in case he dissolv'd it, he must give over all Thoughts of Foreign Af∣fairs, for no other would ever assist him, but on such Terms as would ruine the Monarchy; so that from Abroad or at Home, he would be destroy'd, if the Parliament were broken, and any accident should happen, of which there were many, to make the Aid of his People necessary to him. This and much more I said to him several times privately, and in the hearing of others. But being over-power'd, the Parliament was broke, the Closetting went on, and a new one was to be chosen: who was
to get by Closetting, I need not say; but it was certainly not I, nor any of my Friends; many of them suffered, who I would fain have saved, and yet I must confess with grief, that when the King was resolv'd, and there was no remedy, I did not quit, as I ought to have done, but served on in order to the calling another Parliament. In the midst of all the prepa∣rations for it, and whilst the Corporations were regulating, the King thought fit to order his Declarations to be read in all Churches, of which I most solemnly protest, I never heard one word, till the King directed it in Council; That drew on the Petition of my Lord the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the other Lords the Bishops, and their Prosecution, which I was so openly against, that by arguing continually to shew the In∣justice and the Imprudence of it, I brought the Fury of the Roman Catholicks upon me to such a degree, and so unani∣mously, that I was just sinking, and I wish I had then sunk: But whatever I did foolishly to preserve myself, I continued still to be the Object of their hatred, and I resolv'd to serve the Publick as well as I could, which I am sure most of the con∣siderable Protestants then at Court can testifie; and so can one very eminent man of the Country, whom I would have perswaded to come into business, which he might have done, to have helped me to resist the violence of those in Power; But he despaired of being able to do any good, and therefore would not engage. Sometime after came the first News of the Prince's designs, which were not then look'd on, as they have proved, no body foreseeing the Miracles he has done by his wonderful Prudence, Conduct, and Courage, for the greatest thing which has been undertaken these thousand years, or perhaps ever, could not be effected without Vertues hardly to be imagined till seen nearer hand. Upon the first thought of his coming I laid hold of the opportunity to press the King to do several things which I would have had done sooner; the chief of which were to restore Magdalen College, and all other Ecclesiastical Preferments, which had been diverted from what they were intended for, to take off my Lord Bishop of London's Suspension, to put the Counties into the same hands they were in some time before, to annul the Ecclesiastical Court, and to restore entirely all the Corporations of England. These things were done effectually by the help of some about the King;☞ and it was then thought, I had destroyed my self, by enraging again the whole Roman Catholick Party to such a height as had not been seen: They dispersed Libels of me every day, told the King that I betrayed him, that I ruined him by perswading him to make such shameful Condescen∣tions;☜ but most of all by hindring the securing the chief of the disaffected Nobility and Gentry, which was proposed as a certain way to break all the Prince's Measures; and by advi∣sing
His Majesty to call a Free-Parliament, and to depend upon that, rather than upon Foreign Assistance. It is true I did give him those Counsels which were called weak to the last Moment he suffered me in his Service; then I was accused of holding Correspondence with the Prince, and it was every where said amongst them, That no better could be expected from a Man so related as I was to the Bedford and Leicester Fa∣milies, and so allied to Duke Hamilton, and the Marquess of Halifax. After this, Accusations of High Treason were brought against me, which, with some other Reasons relating to Affairs Abroad, drew the King's Displeasure upon me, so as to turn me out of all without any Consideration, and yet I thought I escaped well, expecting nothing less than the loss of my Head, as my Lord Middleton can tell, and I believe none about the Court thought otherwise; nor had it been otherwise, if my Disgrace had been deferred a day longer; all things being pre∣pared for it: I was put out the 27th of October, the Roman Catholicks having been two Months working the King up to it, without Intermission, besides the several Attacks they had made upon me before, and the unusal Assistance they obtained to do what they thought so necessary for the car∣rying on their Affairs, of which they never had greater hope than at that time, as may be remembred by any who were then at London. But you desired I would say something to you of Ireland, which I will do in very few Words, but exactly true. My Lord Tyrconnell has been so absolute there, that I never had the Credit to make an Ensign, er keep one in, nor to preserve some of my Friends, for whom I was much concern'd, from the last Oppression and Injustice, tho' I endeavoured it to the utmost of my Power; But yet with Care and Diligence, being upon the place, and he absent, I diverted the Calling a Parliament there, which was designed to alter the Acts of Set∣tlement. Chief Justice Nugent, and Baron Rice were sent over with a Draught of an Act for that purpose, furnished with all the pressing Arguments could be thought on to per∣suade the King; and I was offered forty thousand pounds for my Concurrence, which I told to the King, and shewed him at the same time the Injustice of what was proposed to him, and the prejudice it would be to that Country, with so good suc∣cess, that he resolved not to think of it that Year, and per∣haps never. This I was help'd in by some Friends, particularly my Lord Godolphin, who knows it to be true, and so do the Judges before named, and several others. I cannot omit saying something of France, there having been so much talk of a League between the two Kings. I do protest I never knew of any; and if there were such a thing, it was carried on by other sort of Men last Summer. Indeed
French Ships were offered to joyn with our Fleet, and they were refused; since the noise of the Prince's Design, more Ships were offered, and it was agreed how they should be commanded, if ever desired. I opposed to Death the ac∣cepting of them, as well as any Assistance of Men, and can say most truly, that I was the Principal Means of hindring both, by the help of some Lords, with whom I consulted every day, and they with me, to prevent what we thought would be of great prejudice, if not ruinous to the Nation. If the Report is true, of Men, Ships, and Money intended lately for England out of France, it was agreed upon since I was out of Business, or without my Knowledge; if it had been otherwise, I believe no Body thinks my Disgrace would have happened. My greatest Misfortune has been to be thought the Promoter of those Things I opposed and de∣tested, whilst some I could name have been the Inventors and Contrivers of what they have had the Art to lay upon others; and I was often foolishly willing to bear what my Master would have done, tho' I used all possible Endeavours against it. I lie under many other Misfortunes and Afflictions extream heavy, but I hope they have brought me to reflect on the occasion of them, the loose, negligent, unthinking Life I have hitherto led, having been perpetually hurried away from all good Thoughts, by Pleasure, Idleness, the Vanity of the Court, or by Business: I hope, I say, that I shall overcome all the Disorders my former Life had brought upon me, and that I shall spend the remaining part of it in Begging of Almighty God, that he will please either to put an end to my Sufferings, or to give me Strength to bear them; one of which he will certainly grant to such as rely on him, which I hope I do, with the Submission that becomes a good Christian I would enlarge on this Subject, but that I fear you might think something else to be the reason of it, be∣sides a true Sense of my Faults and that obliges me to restrain my self at present. I believe you will repent in having en∣gaged me to give you this Account, but I cannot the doing of what you desire of me. What followed next, were various Reports concerning the loss the Dutch Fleet had sustained in a Storm, which, to amuse us, was heightned in their own Prints; and about the same time a Parcel of the Prince of Orange's Declarations being intercepted in London, when that Expression came to be read, That the Prince was most earnestly invited hither by divers of the Lords, both Spiritual and Temporal, and by many Gentlemen, and others, the King sent for some of the Bishops, and required a Paper under their Hands, in Abhorrence of the Prince's in∣tended Invasion: But they refused to do it, as contrary to their Privilege of Peerage, and their Profession, in promoting
War against a Prince so nearly allyed to the Crown, and ear∣nestly desired that might be left to a Free Parliament; at which the King parted from them with great Indignation. The Wind had been now for almost 3 Weeks perpetually West, during which time the common Question every Mor∣ning was, Have we a Protestant Wind yet? And a Seaman was observed to curse the Dragon on Bow-Steeple for turning his Head where his Tail should be. But, in the latter end of Oct. the Wind came Easterly, to the great Sorrow of the Roman Catholicks, and the Joy of the rest of the Nation: And when almost all Men expected the Invasion would have fallen in the North, and nothing talked of but Burlington-Bay as a Landing-Place, on the 3d of Nov. between 10 and 11 a Clock, the Dutch Fleet was discovered about Half-Seas over, steering a Channel Course Westward, the Wind at E. N. E. a fresh Gale, and on the 5th passing by Dartmouth, it being hazy Weather, they overshot Torbay, where the Prince designed to Land: But about 9 a Clock the Weather cleared up, and the Wind chan∣ged to W. S. W. and the Fleet stood Eastward with a mode∣rate Gale,The Prince of Orange lands in England. being about 4 or 500 Sail, whereof there was 51 Men of War, and 18 Fireships. This Change of Wind was observed by Dr. Burnet to be of no long Duration, but it imme∣diately choped into another Corner, when it had executed its Commission. While the Prince was landing his Army, and advanced to Exeter, the King was vainly endeavouring to sooth the People, by redressing the Disorders committed by the Soldiers, and Promises of a Parliament, which several of the Bishops and Nobility petitioned might be a Free Re∣gular one in all its Circumstances; wherewith His Majesty, to discover his good Disposition, did not appear, by his Answer, to be well-pleased: And all Endeavours were used, to make the Prince and his Army contemptible in the sight of the People, by Printing a List of them, and giving out, That none of the Nobility and Gentry, but only a few Rabble, appeared for him, and that the Prince's Declaration might be kept close from the Knowledge of the People; yet it did not continue so long with the Prince, whose Army was considerably aug∣mented by the Junction of divers Persons of good Quality with him. Neither could the Court any longer keep the De∣claration suppress'd; and therefore they suffered the same to be Printed, with a Preface, and some modest Remarks, as the Author pretends on it. VVhich Declaration was this that follows:
The Declaration of His Highness, WILLIAM HENRY, by the Grace of God, Prince of Orange, &c. of the Reasons inducing him to appear in Arms in the Kingdom of ENGLAND, for preserving of the Protestant Religion, and for Restoring of the Laws and Liberties of Eng∣land, Scotland and Ireland. I. IT is both certain and evident to all Men, That the Publick Peace and Happiness of any State or Kingdom cannot be preserved, where the Laws, Liberties, and Customs Established by the Lawful Authority in it, are openly trans∣gressed and annulled: More especially where the Alteration of Religion is endeavoured, and that a Religion, which is contrary to Law, is endeavoured to be introduced: Upon which those who are most immediately concerned in it, are indispensably bound to endeavour to maintain and preserve the Established Laws, Liberties, and Customs, and above all the Religion and Worship of God, that is Established among them; and to take such an Effectual Care, that the Inha∣bitants of the said State or Kingdom, may neither be de∣prived of their Religion, nor of their Civil Rights; which is so much the more necessary, because the Greatness and Security both of Kings, Royal Families, and of all such as are in Authority, as well as the Happiness of their Sub∣jects and People, depend, in a most especial manner, upon the exact Observation and Maintenance of these their Laws, Liberties and Customs. II. Upon these Grounds it is, that we can't any longer for∣bear to declare, That, to our great Regret, we see that those Counsellors, who have now the chief Credit with the King, have overturned the Religion, Laws and Liberties of these Realms, and subjected them in all things relating to their Consciences, Liberties and Properties, to Arbitrary Govern∣ment, and that not only by secret and indirect VVays, but in an open and undisguised Manner. III. These Evil Counsellors, for the Advancing and Co∣louring this with some plausible Pretexts, did invent and set on Foot the King's Dispensing Power, by Virtue of which they pretend, that, according to Law, he can suspend and dispense with the Execution of the Laws that have been enacted by the Authority of the King and Parliament, for the Security and Happiness of the Subject, and so have ren∣dred those laws of no effect; though there is nothing more certain, than that as no Laws can be made but by the joynt
Concurrence of the King and Parliament, so likewise Laws so Enacted, which secure the Publick Peace and Safety of the Nation, and the Lives and Liberties of every Subject in it, cannot be repealed or suspended but by the same Au∣thority. IV. For though the King may pardon the Punishment that a Transgressor has incurred, and for which he is con∣demned, as in the Cases of Treason or Felony; yet it cannot be with any colour of Reason inferred from thence, that the King can entirely suspend the Execution of those Laws re∣lating to Treason or Felony; unless it is pretended, that he is cloathed with a Despotick and Arbitrary Power; and that the Lives, Liberties, Honours and Estates of the Subjects de∣pend wholly on his Good Will and Pleasure, and are entire∣ly subject to him; which must infallibly follow, on the King's having a Power to suspend the Execution of the Laws, and to dispense with them. V. Those Evil Counsellors, in order to the giving some Credit to this strange and execrable Maxim, have so con∣ducted the Matter, that they have obtained a Sentence from the Judges, declaring, That this Dispensing Power is a Right belonging to the Crown; as if it were in the Power of the Twelve Judges to offer up the Laws, Rights and Li∣berties of the whole Nation to the King, to de disposed of by him Arbitrarily and at his Pleasure, and expresly con∣trary to Laws Enacted for the Security of the Subjects. In order to the obtaining of this Judgment, those Evil Coun∣sellors did before-hand examine secretly the Opinion of the Judges; and procured such of them as could not in Con∣science concur in so pernicious a Sentence, to be turned out, and others to be substituted in their Rooms; till by the Changes that were made in the Courts of Judicature, they at last obtained that Judgment. And they have raised some to those Trusts, who make open Profession of the Po∣pish Religion, tho' those are by Law render'd incapable of all such Employments. VI. It is also manifest and notorious, that as His Majesty was, upon his coming to the Crown, received and acknow∣ledged by all the Subjects of England, Scotland and Ireland, as their King, without the least Opposition, tho' he made then open Profession of the Popish Religion; so he did then pro∣mise, and solemnly swear at his Coronation, That he would maintain His Subjects in the free Enjoyment of their Laws and Liberties: And in particular, That he would maintain the Church of England, as it was Established by Law. It is like∣wise certain, that there have been at divers and sundry times several Laws Enacted for the Preservation of those Rights and Liberties, and of the Protestant Religion: And, among other
Securities, it has been Enacted, That all Persons whatsoever that are advanced to any Ecclesiastical Dignity, or to bear Office in the University; as likewise all others that should be put into any Employment, Civil or Military, should de∣clare that they were not Papists, but were of the Protestant Religion; and that by their Taking of the Oaths of Alle∣giance and Supremacy, and the Test; yet these evil Coun∣sellors have, in effect, annulled and abolished all those Laws which relate to Ecclesiastical and Civil Employment. VII. In order to Ecclesiastical Dignities and Offices, they have not only without any colour of Law, but against most express Laws to the contrary, set up a Commission, of a cer∣tain number of Persons, to whom they committed the Cog∣nisance and Direction of all Ecclesiastical Matters; in the which Commission there has been, and still is one of His Majesty's Ministers of State, who makes now publick pro∣fession of the Popish Religion, and who at the time of his first professing it, declared that for a great while before he had believed that to be the only true Religion. By all this, the deplorable State to which the Protestant Religion is re∣duced, is apparent, since the Affairs of the Church of Eng∣land, are now put into the Hands of Persons who have ac∣cepted of a Commission that is manifestly illegal, and who have executed it contrary to all Law; and that now one of their chief Members has abjured the Protestant Religion, and declared himself a Papist; by which he is become uncapable of holding any Publick Imployment. The said Commissio∣ners have hitherto given such Proof of their Submission to the Directions given them, that there is no Reason to doubt, but they will still continue to promote all such Designs as will be most agreeable to them. And those Evil Counsellors take care to raise none to any Ecclesiastical Dignities, but Persons that have no Zeal for the Protestant Religion, and that hide their unconcernedness for it, under the specious pretence of Moderation. The said Commissioners have su∣spended the Bishop of London, only because he refused to obey an Order that was sent him to suspend a worthy Di∣vine, without so much as citing him before him to make his own Defence, or observing the common Forms of Process. They have turnd out a President chosen by the Fellows of Magdalen College, and afterwards all the Fellows of that Col∣lege, without so much as citing them before any Court that could take legal Cognisance of that Affair, or obtaining any Sentence against them by a competent Judge. And the only Reason that was given for turning them out was, their re∣fusing to chuse for their President, a person that was recom∣mended to them by the Instigation of those Evil Counsel∣lors, though the Right of a Free Election belonged undoubt∣edly
to them. But they were turned out of their Free-Holds contrary to Law, and to that express provision in the Magna Charta, That no Man shall lose Life or Goods, but by the Law of the Land. And now these Evil Counsellors have put the said College wholly into the Hands of Papists, tho', as is abovesaid, they are incapable of all such Employments, both by the Law of the Land, and the Statutes of the College. These Commissioners have also cited before them all the Chancellors and Arch Deacons of England, requiring them to certifie to them the Names of all such Clergy-men as have Read the King's Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, and of such as have not Read it; without considering that the Reading thereof was not enjoyned the Clergy by the Bi∣shops, who are their Ord∣naries. The Illegality and In∣competency of the said Court of the Ecclesiastical Commis∣sioners was so notoriously known, and it did so evidently ap∣pear, that it tended to the Subversion of the Protestant Re∣ligion, that the Most Reverend Father in God, William Arch∣bishop of Canterbury, Primate and Metropolitan of England, seeing that it was raised for no other End but to oppress such Persons as were of eminent Vertue, Learning and Pie∣ty, refused to sit, or to concur in it. VIII. And tho' there are many express Laws against, all Churches or Chapels, for the Exercise of the Popish Reli∣gion; and also against all Monasteries and Convents, and more particularly against the Order of the Jesuites, yet those Evil Counsellors have procured Orders for the Building of several Churches and Chapels for the Exercise of that Re∣ligion. They have also procured divers Monasteries to be Erected; and, in contempt of the Laws, they have not only set up several Colleges of Jesuites in divers places, for the corrupting of the Youth, but have raised up one of the Or∣der to be a Privy-Counsellor, and a Minister of State. By all which they do evidently shew, that they are restrained by no Rules of Law whatsoever, but that they have subjected the Honours and Estates of the Subjects, and the Established Religion to a Despotick Power, and to Arbitrary Govern∣ment. In all which they are served and seconded by those Ecclesiastical Commissioners. IX. They have also followed the same Methods, with re∣lation to Civil Affairs; for they have procured Orders to examine all Lord-Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, and all others that were in any Publick Employment, if they would concur with the King in the Repeal of the Test and Penal Laws; and all such whose Consciences did not suffer them to comply with their De∣signs, were turned out, and others were put in their Places, whom they believed would be more compliant to them in
their Designs of defeating the Intent and Execution of those Laws, which had been made with so much Care and Cau∣tion, for the Security of the Protestant Religion. And in many of these Places they have put professed Protestants, tho' the Law has disabled them. and warranted the Subjects not to have any Regard to their Orders. X. They have also invaded the Privileges, and seized on the Charters of most of those Towns that have a Right to be Represented by their Burgesses in Parliament; and have procured Surrenders to be made of them, by which the Ma∣gistrates in them have delivered up all their Rights and Pri∣vileges, to be disposed of at the Pleasure of those Evil Coun∣sellors; who have thereupon placed new Magistrates in those Towns, such as they can most entirely confide in; and in many of them they put Popish Magistrates, notwithstanding the Incapacities under which the Law has put them. XI. And whereas no Nation whatsoever can subsist with∣out the Administration of good and impartial Justice, upon which Mens Lives, Liberties, Honours and Estates do depend, those Evil Counsellors have subjected these to an Arbitrary and Despotick Power: In the most important Affairs, they have studied to discover before-hand the Opinions of the Judges; and have turned out such as they found would not conform themselves to their Intentions, and have put others in their Places, of whom they were more assured, without having any regard to their Abilities: And they have not stuck to raise even professed Papists to the Courts of Judi∣cature, notwithstanding their Incapacity by Law, and that no Regard is due to any Sentences flowing from them, They have carried this so far, as to deprive such Judges, who, in common Administration of Justice, shewed that they were governed by their Consciences, and not by the Direct∣ions which the others gave them. By which it is apparent, that they design to render themselves the Absolute Masters of the Lives, Honours and Estates of the Subjects, of what Rank or Dignity soever they may be; and that without ha∣ving any Regard either to the Equity of the Cause, or to the Consciences of the Judges, whom they will have to submit in all things to their own VVill and Pleasure; hoping by such Ways to intimidate those who are in Employment, as also such others, as they shall think fit, to put in the room of those whom they have turned out; and to make them see what they must look for, if they should at any time act in the least contrary to their good liking; and that no Failings in that kind are pardoned in any Person whatsoever. A great deal of Blood has been shed in many Places of the Kingdom, by Judges governed by those Evil Counsellors, against all the Rules and Forms of Law, without so much as suffering the
Persons that were accused to plead in their own De∣fence. XII. They have also, by putting the Administration of Civil Justice in the Hands of Papists, brought all the Mat∣ters of Civil Justice into great Uncertainties; with how much Exactness and Justice soever these Sentences may have been given. For since the Laws of the Land do not only exclude Papists from all Places of Judicature, but have put them under an Incapacity, none are bound to acknow∣ledge or to obey their Judgments, and all Sentences given by them are null and void of themselves: So that all Per∣sons who have been cast in Trials before such Popish Judges, may justly look on their pretended Sentences, as having no more Force than the Sentences of any private and unautho∣rized Person whatsoever. So deplorable is the Case of the Subjects, who are obliged to answer to such Judges, that must in all things stick to the Rules which are set them by those Evil Counsellors, who as they raised them up to those Employments, so can turn them out at Pleasure; and who can never be esteemed lawful Judges; so that all their Sentences are in the Construction of the Law, of no Force and Efficacy. They have likewise disposed of all Military Employments, but have in particular provided, that they should be disarm'd; yet they, in contempt of these Laws, have not only armed the Papists, but have like∣wise raised them up to the greatest Military Trust, both by Sea and Land, and that Strangers as well as Natives, and Irish as well as English, that so by those means, having rendred themselves Masters both of the Affairs of the Church, of the Government of the Nation, and of the Courts of Justice, and subjected them all to a Despotick and Arbitrary Power, they might be in a capacity to main∣tain and execute their wicked Designs, by the Assistance of the Army, and thereby to enslave the Nation. XIII. The Dismal Effects of this Subversion of the Esta∣blished Religion, Laws and Liberties in England, appear more evidently to us, by what we see done in Ireland; where the whole Government is put in the Hands of Papists, and where all the Protestant Inhabitants are under the daily Fears of what may be justly apprehended from the Arbi∣trary Power which is set up there; which has made great numbers of them leave that Kingdom, and abandon their Estates in it, remembring well that cruel and bloody Mas∣sacre which fell out in that Island in the Year 1641. XIV. Those Evil Counsellors have also prevailed with the King to declare in Scotland, That he is cloathed with Ab∣solute Power, and that all the Subjects are bound to Obey him without Reserve: Upon which he assumed an Arbitrary
Power both over the Religion and Laws of the Kingdom; from all which it's apparent, what is to be looked for in England, as soon as Matters are duly prepared for it. XV. Those great and insufferable Oppressions, and the open Contempt of all Law, together with the Apprehen∣sions of the sad Consequences that must certainly follow upon it, have put the Subjects under great and just Fears; and have made them look after Lawful Remedies as are al∣low'd of in all Nations; yet all has been without effect. And those Evil Counsellors have endeavoured to make all Men apprehend the Loss of their Lives, Liberties, Honours, and Estates, if they should go about to preserve them∣selves from this Oppression, by Petition, Representations, or other Means Authorized by Law. Thus did they pro∣ceed with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the other Bishops, who having offered a most Humble Petition to the King, in Terms full of Respect, and not exceeding the Number limited by Law, in which they set forth, in short, the Reasons for which they could not obey that Order, which, by the Instigation of those Evil Counsellors, was sent them, requiring them to appoint their Clergy to read in their Churches the Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, were sent to Prison, and afterwards brought to a Trial, as if they had been guilty of some enormous Crime. They were not only obliged to defend themselves in that pursuit, but to appear before professed Papists, who had not taken the Test, and by consequence were Men whose Interest led them to condemn them; and the Judges that gave their Opinions in their Favours, were thereupon turned out. XVI. And yet it cannot be pretended, that any Kings, how great soever their Power has been, and how Arbitrary and Despotick soever they have been in the Exercise of it, have ever reckoned it a Crime for their Subjects to come in all Submission and Respect, and in a due number, not ex∣ceeding the Limits of the Law, and represent to them the Reasons that made it impossible for them to obey their Or∣ders. Those Evil Counsellors have also treated a Peer of the Realm as a Criminal, only because he said, That the Subjects were not bound to obey the Orders of a Popish Justice of Peace; though it's Evident, that they being by Law ren∣dred incapable of all such Trusts, no regard is due to their Orders. This being the Security which the People have by the Law for their Lives, Liberties and Estates, that they are not to be subjected to the Arbitrary Proceedings of Papists, that are contrary to Law, put into any Employments Civil or Military.
XVII. Both we our selves, and our dearest and most entirely Beloved Consort the Princess, have endeavoured to signifie, in Terms full of Respect to the King, the just and deep Regret which all these Proceedings have given us; and in Compliance with His Majesty's Desires signified to us, We declared both by Word of Mouth, to his Envoy, and in Writing, what our Thoughts were, touching the Repealing of the Test and Penal Laws; which we did in such a man∣ner, that we hop'd we had proposed an Expedient, by which the Peace of those Kingdoms, and a happy Agree∣ment among the Subjects of all Perswasions, might have been settled; but those Evil Counsellors have put such ill Con∣structions on these our good Intentions, that they have en∣deavoured to alienate the King more and more from us; as if we had designed to disturb the Quiet and Happiness of the Kingdom. XVIII. The last and great Remedy for all these Evils, is the Calling of a Parliament, for securing the Nation against those evil Practices of those wicked Counsellors; but this could not be yet compassed, nor can be easily brought about. For those Men apprehending, that a Lawful Parliament being once Assembled, they would be brought to an Ac∣count for all their open Violations of Law, and for their Plots and Conspiracies against the Protestant Religion, and the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects, they have endea∣voured under the specious Pretence of Liberty of Conscience, first to sow Divisions among Protestants, between those of the Church of England and Dissenters: The Design being laid to engage Protestants, that are equally concerned to preserve themselves from Popish Oppression, into Mutual Quarrellings, that so by these, some Advantages may be given to them to bring about their Designs; and that both in the Election of Members of Parliament, and afterwards in the Parliament it self. For they see well, that if all Protestants could enter into a good understanding one with another, and concur together in the preserving of their Re∣ligion, it would not be possible for them to compass their wicked Ends. They have also required all Persons in the several Counties of England, that either were in any Em∣ployment, or were in any considerable Esteem, to declare before-hand, that they would concur in the Repeal of the Penal Laws; and that they would give their Voices in the Elections to Parliament, only for such as would concur in it: Such as would not thus preingage themselves, were turn'd out of all Employments; and others who entred into those Engagements were put in their Places, many of them being Papists: And contrary to the Charters and Priviledges of those Boroughs that have a Right to send Burgesses to Parliament, they have ordered such Regulations to be made as they thought fit and necessary, for assuring themselves of
all the Members that are to be chosen by those Corpora∣tions; and by this means they hope to avoid that Puni∣shment which they have deserved; tho' it is apparent, that all Acts made by Popish Magistrates are null and void of themselves: So that no Parliament can be Lawful, for which the Elections and Returns are made by Popish Magistrates, Sheriffs and Mayors of Towns; and therefore as long as the Authority and Magistracy is in such Hands, it is not pos∣sible to have any Lawful Parliament. And tho', according to the Constitution of the English Government, and Imme∣morial Custom, all Elections of Parliament-Men ought to be made with an entire Liberty, without any sort of Force, or the requiring the Electors to chuse such Persons as shall be named to them; and the Persons thus freely Elected▪ ought to give their Opinions freely, upon all Matters that are brought before them, having the Good of the Nation ever before their Eyes, and following in all things the Di∣ctates of their Conscience; yet now the People of England cannot expect a Remedy from a Free Parliament, Legally Called and Chosen. But they may perhaps see one Called, in which all Elections will be carried by Fraud or Force, and which will be composed of such Persons, of whom those evil Counsellors hold themselves well assured, in which all things will be carried on according to their Direction and In∣terest, without any regard to the Good or Happiness of the Nation. Which may appear evidently from this, That the same Persons tried the Members of the last Parliament, to gain them to consent to the Repeal of the Test and Penal Laws, and procured that Parliament to be dissolved, when they found that they could not, neither by Promises nor Threatnings, prevail with the Members to comply with their wicked Design. XIX. But, to Crown all, there are great and violent Presumptions, inducing us to believe, that those Evil Coun∣sellors, in order to the carrying on their ill Designs, and to the gaining to themselves the more time for the effecting of them, for the Encouragement of their Complices, and for the discouraging of all good Subjects, have publish'd, That the Queen hath brought forth a Son; tho' there have appeared, both during the Queen's pretended Bigness, and in the manner in which the Birth was managed, so many just and visible Grounds of Suspicion, that not only we our selves, but all the Good Subjects of this Kingdom, do vehe∣mently suspect, That the pretended Prince of Wales was not born by the Queen. And it was notoriously known to all the World, that many both doubted of the Queen's Bigness, and of the Birth of the Child, and yet there was not any
one thing done to satisfie them, or put an end to their Doubts. XX. And since Our dearest and most entirely Beloved Consort the Princess, and likewise We Our Selves, have so great an Interest in this Matter, and such a Right as all the World knows, to the Succession to the Crown: Since all the English did in the Year 1672. when the States General of the Vnited Provinces were invaded with a most unjust War, use their utmost Endeavours to put an end to that War, and that in Opposition to those who were then in the Government; and by their so doing, they run the hazard of losing both the Favour of the Court, and their Employ∣ments: And since the English Nation has ever testified a most particular Affection and Esteem, both to our dearest Con∣sort the Princess, and to Our selves, We cannot excuse our selves from espousing their Interest, in a Matter of such High Consequence: And for contributing all that lies in us, for the maintaining both of the Protestant Religion, and of the Laws and Liberties of those Kingdoms, and for the Secu∣ring to them the continual Enjoyment of all their just Rights. To the doing of which, We are most earnestly sollicited by a great many Lords, both Sipiritual and Tem∣poral, and by many Gentlemen, and other Subjects of all Ranks. XXI. Therefore it is, That We have thought fit to go over to England, and to carry over with us a Force▪ sufficient, by the Blessing of God, to defend us from the Violence of those Evil Counsellors. And We, being desirous that our Intentions in this might be rightly understood, have for this end prepared this Declaration; in which, as We have hi∣therto given a True Account of the Reasons inducing us to it; so we now think fit to declare, That this our Expedi∣tion is intended for no other Design, but to have a Free and Lawful Parliament Assembled, as soon as it is possible; and that, in order to this, all the late Charters by which the Elections of Burgesses are limitted contrary to the An∣cient Custom, shall be considered as null, and of no Force: And likewise all Magistrates who have been un∣justly turned out, shall forthwith resume their former Employments, as well as all the Boroughs of England, shall return again to their Ancient Prescriptions and Charters: And more particularly, that the Ancient Charter of the Great and Famous City of London, shall again be in Force: And that the Writs for the Members of Parliament shall be Addressed to the proper Officers, according to Law and Cu∣stom: That also none be suffered to chuse, or to be chosen Members of Parliament, but such as are qualified by Law: And that the Members of Parliament being thus chosen,
they shall meet and sit in full Freedom; that so the Two Houses may concur in the preparing such Laws, as they upon full and free Debate, shall judge necessary and conve∣nient, both for the Confirming and Executing the Law con∣cerning the Test, and such others Laws as are necessary for the Security and Maintenance of the Protestant Religion; as likewise for making such Laws as may Establish a good Agreement between the Church of England and all Prote∣stant Dissenters; as also for the Covering and Securing of all such who live peaceably under the Government, as be∣comes good Subjects, from all Persecution upon the Ac∣count of their Religion, even Papists themselves not ex∣cepted; and for the doing of all other things, which the Two Houses of Parliament shall find necessary for the Peace, Honour and Safety of the Nation, so that there may be no more Danger of the Nation's falling at any time hereafter under Arbitrary Government. To this Parliament we will refer the Enquiry into the Birth of the pretended Prince of Wales, and of all things relating to it, and to the Right of Succession, XXII. And We, for our part, will concur in every thing that may procure the Peace and Happiness of the Nation, which a Free and Lawful Parliament shal determine; since we have nothing before our Eyes in this our Undertaking, but the Preservation of the Protestant Religion, the Cove∣ring of all Men from Persecution for their Consciences, and the Securing the whole Nation the Free Enjoyment of all their Laws, Rights, and Liberties, under a just and legal Government. XXIII. This is the Design that We have proposed to our selves, in appearing upon this Occasion in Arms, in the Conduct of which we will keep the Forces under our Com∣mand, under all the Strictness of Martial Discipline, and take special Care, That the People of the Countries, through which we must march, shal not suffer by their Means; and as soon as the State of the Nation will ad∣mit of it, we promise, That we will send back all those Foreign Forces that we have brought along with us. XXIV. We do therefore hope, That all People will judge rightly of us, and approve of these our Proceedings: But we chiefly rely on the Blessing of God for the Success of this our Undertaking, in which we place our whole and only Confidence. XXV. We do in the last place invite and require all Per∣sons whatsoever, all the eers of the Realm, both Spiritual and Temporal, all Lords-Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, and all Gentlemen, Citizens, and other Commons of all Ranks, to come and assist Us, in order to the Executing of
this our Design against all such as shall endeavour to op∣pose us; that so we may prevent all those Miseries, which must needs follow upon the Nations being kept under Ar∣bitrary Government and Slavery: And that all the Violen∣ces and Disorders which have overturned the whole Consti∣tution of the English Government, may be fully redressed in a Free and Legal Parliament. XXVI. And we do likewise resolve, That as soon as the Nation is brought to a state of Quiet, we will take care that a Parliament shall be called in Scotland, for Restoring the Ancient Constitution of that Kingdom, and for bringing the Matters of Religion to such a Settlement, that the People may live easie and happy, and for putting an end to all the unjust Violences, that have been in a Course of so many Years committed there. We will also study to bring the Kingdom of Ireland to such a State, that the Settlement there, may be Religiously observed; and that the Protestant and British Interest there, may be secured. And we will endeavour, by all possible means, to procure such an Establishment in all the Three Kingdoms, that they may all live in a happy Union and Correspondence together; and that the Protestant Re∣ligion, and the Peace, Honour and Happiness of those NATIONS, may be Established upon Lasting Foun∣dations.

To this Declaration the Prince, upon further Information of things, thought fit to add another to this purpose. AFter we had Prepared and Printed this Our Declaration, we have understood, that the Subverters of the Re∣ligion and Laws of these Kingdoms, hearing of our Prepa∣rations to assist the People against them, have began to re∣tract some of the Arbitrary and Despotick Power that they had assumed, and to vacate some of their unjust Judgments and Decrees. The Sense of their Guilt, and the Distrust of their Force, have induced them to offer to the City of London, some seeming Relief from their great Oppressions,
hoping thereby to quiet the People, and to divert them from demanding a Re-establishment of their Religion and Laws, under the shelter of our Arms: They do also give out, That we do intend to Conquer and Enslave the Nation; and therefore it is, we have thought fit to add a few Words to our Declaration. VVe are confident, That no Persons can have such hard Thoughts of us, as to imagine we have any other Design in this our Undertaking, than to procure a Settlement of the Religion, and of the Liberties and Properties of the Subjects upon so sure a Foundation, that there may be no Danger of the Nation's Relapsing into the like Miseries at any time hereafter. And as the For∣ces we have brought along with us, are utterly dis∣proportioned to that Wicked Design of Conquering the Nation, if we were capable of intending it; so the great Numbers of the Principal Nobility and Gentry that are Men of Eminent Quality and Estates, and Per∣sons of known Integrity and Zeal, both for the Religion and Government of ENGLAND, many of them being also distinguished by their Constant Fidelity to the Crown, who do both accompany us in this Expedi∣tion, and have earnestly sollicited us to it, will cover us from all such Malicious Insinuations: For it is not to be imagined, that either those who have invited us, or those who are already come to assist us, can join in a wicked Attempt of Conquest, to make void their own Lawful Titles to their Honours, Estates and In∣terests. We are also confident, That all Men see how little Weight there is to be laid on all Promises and Engage∣ments that can be now made; since there has been so little regard had in the time past, to the most solemn Pro∣mises. And as that imperfect Redress that is now offer'd, is a plain Confession of those Violences of the Govern∣ment that we have set forth; so the Defectiveness of it is no less apparent: For they lay down nothing which they may not take up at pleasure; and they reserve entire, and not so much as mentioned, their Claims and Pretences to an Arbitrary and Despotick Power, which has been the Root of all their Oppression, and of the Total Subversion of the Government. And it is plain, That there can be no Redress, no Remedy offered but in Parliament, by a Declaration of the Rights of the Subjects that have been invaded, and not by any pre∣tended Acts of Grace, to which the Extremity of their Affairs has driven them. Therefore it is that we have
thought fit to declare, That we will Refer all to a Free Assembly of this NATION, in a Lawful Par∣liament. Given under Our Hand and Seal at Our Court in the Hague, the 24th Day of October, in the Year of Our Lord 1688. WILLIAM HENRY, Prince of Orange. By His Highness's Special Command, C. HUYGENS. At the same time an Extract of the States-General's Reso∣lution was privately Printed at London; wherein, among other Reasons why they had intrusted the Prince of Orange with such a Fleet and Army, is this which follows: THE King of France hath, upon several Occasions, shewed himself dissatisfied with this State; which gave Cause to fear and apprehend, that in case the King of Great Britain should happen to compass within his King∣dom, and obtain an Absolute Power over his People, that then both Kings, out of the Interest of State, and Hatred and Zeal against the Protestant Religion, would endeavour to bring this State to confusion; and, if possible quite to subject it. There was also Printed about the same Juncture this Letter of the Prince of Orange, to the Officers of the Army. Gentlemen, and Friends, WE have given you so full and so true an Account of Our Intentions in this Expedition, in Our De∣claration, that as We can add nothing to it, so We are sure you can desire nothing more of Us. We are come to pre∣serve your Religion, and to Restore and Establish your Li∣berties and Properties; And therefore We cannot suffer Our Selves to doubt, but that all true English Men will come and concur with Us, in Our Desire to Secure these Nations from Popery and Slavery. You must all plainly see, That you are only made use of as Instruments to enslave the Nation, and ruine the Protestant Religion; and when that is done, you may judge what ye your selves ought to expect, both from the Cashiering all the Protestant and English Officers and Soldiers in Ireland, and by the Irish Soldiers being
brought over to be put in your Places; and of which you have seen so fresh an Instance, that We need not put you in mind of it. You know how many of your Fellow-Of∣ficers have been used, for their standing firm to the Prote∣stant Religion, and to the Laws of England: And you can∣not flatter your selves so far as to expect to be better used, if those who have broke their Word so often, should by your Means be brought out of those Streights to which they are at present reduced. We hope likewise that ye will not suffer your selves to be abused by a false Notion of Honour; but that you will, in the first place, consider what you owe to Almighty God and your Religion, to your Country, to your Selves, to your Posterity; which you, as Men of Ho∣nour, ought to prefer to all private Considerations and Engagements whatsoever. We do therefore expect, That you will consider the Honour that is now set before you, of being the Instruments of Serving your Country, and Secu∣ring your Religion; and We shall ever remember the Ser∣vice you shall do Us upon this Occasion, and will pro∣mise you, that We shall place such particular Marks of Our Favour on every one of you, as your Behaviour at this time shall deserve of Us, and the Nation; in which We shall make a great Distinction of those that shall come seasonably to join their Arms with Ours: And you shall find Us to be your Well-wishing and assured Friend, W. H. P. O. This Letter was spread under-hand over the whole King∣dom, and read by all sorts of Men; and the Reason of it being undeniable, it had a great Force on the Spirits of the Soldiery; so that those who did not presently comply with it, yet resolved they would never strike one stroke in this Quar∣rel, till they had a Parliament to secure the Religion, Laws and Liberties of England: Which the Court, on the other side, had resolved should not be granted, till the Prince of Orange, with his Army, was expelled out of the Nation, and till all those that had submitted to him (which were not many then) were reduced into their Power, to be treated as they thought fit. In the mean time the Fleet came about from the Buoy in the Nre, to Portsmouth, under the Command of the Lord Dartmouth, where it arrived on Saturday the 17th of November, and on the Monday following the KING entred Salisbury, which was then the Head Quarters of the whole Army. But on the 16th of the aforesaid Month, the Lord Delamere having received certain Intelligence of the Landing of the Prince of Orange in the West, and seeing the Irish throng over in Arms, under pretence of Assisting the King, but, in reality, to enslave us at Home, as they had already
reduced our Country-Men in Ireland to the lowest Degree of Danger and Impuissance that they have at any time been in since the Conquest of Ireland, in the Reign of King Henry II. He thereupon Assembled Fifty Horse-Men, and at the Head of them marched to Manchester; and the next Day he went to Bodon-Downes, his Forces being then 150 strong, declaring, his Design was, To join with the Prince of Orange. This small Party of Men, by degrees, drew in all the North, and could never be suppressed. Now before His Royal Highness the Prince of Orange left Exeter, there was an Association drawn up, and signed by all the Lords and Gentlemen that were with him; the Date of which I cannot assign; but the Words thereof are as follow. VVE whose Names are hereunto subscribed, who have now joined with the Prince of Orange, for the Defence of the Protestant Religion, and for the maintaining the Antient Government, and the Laws and Liberties of Eng∣land, Scotland and Ireland, do engage to Almighty God, to His Highness the Prince of Orange, and to one another, to stick firm to this Cause, and to one another, in Defence of it; and never to depart from it, until our Religion, Laws and Liberties are so far secured to us, in a Free Parliament, that we shall be no more in danger of falling into Popery and Slavery. And whereas we are engaged in this Common Cause, under the Protection of the Prince of Orange, by which means his Person may be exposed to Danger, and to the cursed Attempts of Papists and other Bloody Men; we do therefore solemnly engage to God and one another, that if any such Attempt be made upon him, we will pursue not only those who make it, but all their Adherents, and all that we find in Arms against us, with the utmost Severity of a just Revenge, to their Ruine and Destruction. And that the Execution of any such Attempt (which God, of his Infinite Mercy, forbid) shall not di∣vert us from prosecuting this Cause which we do now undertake; but that it shall engage us to carry it on with all the Rigour that so barbarous a Practice shall deserve. On the 20th of November there happened a Skirmish at Wincanton, between a Detachment of 70 Horse and 50 Dra∣goons and Granadiers, commanded by Colonel Sarsfeild, and about 30 of the Prince of Orange's Men, Commanded by one Cambel; where, notwithstanding the great Inequality of Numbers, yet the latter fought with that desperate Bravery, that it struck a Terrour into the Minds of the Army, who were otherwise sufficiently averse from Fighting: And besides, the Action was every where magnified so much above the real Truth, that it shewed clearly how much Men wished the Prosperity of the Prince's Arms.
On the 22th of November the Nobility, Gentry and Com∣monalty, then assembled at Nottingham, made this Decla∣ration: VVE the Nobility, Gentry and Commonalty of these Northern Counties, assembled at Nottin∣gham, for the Defence of the Laws, Religion and Proper∣ties, according to the Free-born Liberties and Privileges descended to us from our Ancestors, as the undoubted Birth-right of the Subjects of this Kingdom of England, (not doubting but the Ifringers and Invaders of our Rights will represent us to the rest of the Nation in the most malicious Dress they can put upon us,) do here unani∣mously think it our Duty to declare to the rest of our Pro∣testant Fellow-Subjects, the Grounds of our present Under∣taking. We are, by innumerable Grievances, made sensible, that the very Fundamentals of our Religion, Liberties and Pro∣perties are about to be rooted out by our late Jesuitical Privy-Council; as has been of late too apparent, 1. By the King's dispensing with all the Established Laws at his Pleasure. 2. By displacing all Officers out of all Offices of Trust and Advantage, and placing others in their room, that are known Papists deservedly made incapable by the Established Laws of this Land. 3. By destroying the Char∣ters of most Corporations in the Land. 4. By discouraging all Persons that are not Papists, and preferring such as turn to Popery. 5. By displacing all honest and consci∣encious Judges, unless they would, contrary to their Con∣sciences, declare that to be Law, which was merely arbitra∣ry. 6. By branding all Men with the Name of Rebels, that but offered to justifie the Laws, in a Legal Course, against the Arbitrary Proceedings of the King, or any of his cor∣rupt Ministers. 7. By burthening the Nation with an Ar∣my, to maintain the Violation of the Rights of the Subjects; and by discountenancing the Established Religion. 8. By forbidding the Subjects the Benefit of Petitioning, and con∣struing them Libellers; so rendering the Laws a Nose of Wax, to serve their Arbitrary Ends. And many more such like, too long here to enumerate. We being thus made sadly sensible of the Arbitrary and Tyrannical Government, that is by the Influence of Jesui∣tical Counsels coming upon us, do unanimously declare, That not being willing to deliver our Posterity over to such a Condition of Popery and Slavery, as the aforesaid Op∣pressions do inevitably threaten; we will, to the utmost of our power, oppose the same, by joining with the Prince of Orange, (whom, we hope, God Almighty hath sent to
rescue us from the Oppressions aforesaid;) and will use our utmost Endeavours for the Recovery of our almost-ruined Laws, Liberties and Religion: And herein we hope all good Protestant Subjects will, with their Lives and Fortunes, be assistant to us, and not be bugbear'd with the opprobrious Terms of Rebels; by which they would af∣fright us to become perfect Slaves to their Tyrannical In∣solencies and Usurpatations: For we assure our selves, that no rational and unbyassed Person will judge it Rebellion to defend our Laws and Religion, which all our Princes have, at their Coronation, sworn to do: Which Oath, how well it hath been observed of late, we desire a Free Parliament may have the Consideration of. We own it Rebellion to resist a King that governs by Law: But he was always accounted a Tyrant, that made his Will the Law; and to resist such an one, we justly esteem no Rebellion, but a necessary Defence. And on this Consideration, we doubt not of all honest Mens Assi∣stance; and humbly hope for, and implore the Great GOD's Protection, who turneth the Hearts of His People as pleaseth Him best; it having been observed, that Peo∣ple can never be of one Mind without His Inspiration: Which hath in all Ages confirmed that Observation, Vox Populi est Vox Dei. The present Restoring the Charters, and Reversing the oppressing and unjust Judgment given on the Fellows of Magdalen College, is plain, are but to still the People, like Plumbs to Children, by deceiving them for a while: But if they shall by this Stratagem be fooled till this present Storm that threatens the Papists be past, as soon as they shall be re-settled, the former Oppression will be put on with greater Vigour. But we hope, In vain is the Net spread in sight of the Birds: For, the Papists old Rule is, that Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks, as they term Protestants, tho' the Popish Religion is the greatest Heresie. And Queen Mary's so ill observing her Promises to the Suffolk Men, that helped her to her Throne. And, above all, the Pope's dispensing with the Breach of Oaths, Treaties, or Promises, at his pleasure, when it makes for the Service of Holy Church, as they term it. These, we say, are such convincing Reasons to hinder us from giving Credit to the aforesaid Mock-Shews of Redress, that we think our selves bound in Conscience to rest on no Security that shall not be approved by a Freely-elected Parliament: To whom, under GOD, we refer our Cause.
In the mean time, the Nobility about the King having used all the Arguments they could invent, to persuade him to call a Free Parliament, and finding him immovable fix'd i a contrary Resolution, and the Army in great Discontent, Disorder and Fear, and the whole Nation ready to take fire, the Duke of Grafton, the Lord Churchill, and many other Protestant Nobility, left him, and went over to the Prince of Orange, who was then at Sherburn; as did also Prince George of Denmark, the Duke of Ormond, and Sir George Hew∣et, Nov. 25th. The Prince, at his going away, left the following Letter for the King. SIR, WIth an Heart full of Grief am I forced to write what Prudence will not permit me to say to your Face:P. George's Letter to the King. And may I eer find Credit with Your Majesty, and Protection from Heaven, as what I now do is free from Passion, Vanity, or Design, with which Actions of this Nature are too often accompanied. I am not ignorant of the frequent Mischiefs wrought in the World by factious Pretences of Religion; but were not Religion the most justifiable Cause, it would not be made the most specious Pretence. And your Majesty has already shewn too interested a Sense of Re∣ligion, to doubt the just Effects of it on one, whose Practices have, I hope, never given the World cause to censure his real Conviction of it; or his backwardness to perform what his Honour and Con∣science prompt him to. How then can I longer disguise my just Concern for that Religion, in which I have been so happily edu∣cated, which my Judgment truly convinceth me to be the Best, and for the Support of which I am so highly interested in my Na∣tive Country? And is not England now, by the most endearing Tye, become so? Whilst the restless Spirits of the Enemies of the Reformed Religion, back'd by the cruel Zeal and prevailing Power of France, justly alarm and unite all the Protestant Princes of Chri∣stendom, and engage them in so vast an Expence for the Support of it: Can I act so degenerous and mean a Part, to deny my Concurrence to such worthy Endeavours, for the disabusing your Ma∣jesty by the Re-inforcement of those Laws, and Re-establishment of that Government, on which alone depends the Well-being of your Majesty, and of the Protestant Religion in Europe. This, Sir, is that irresistible and only Cause that could come in Competi∣tion with my Duty and Obligation to your Majesty, and be able to fear me from you; whilst the same affectionate Desire of serving You continues in me. Could I secure your Person  by the hazard of my Life, I should think it could not be better employed. And, would to God these your distracted Kingdoms might yet receive that satisfactory Compliance from your Majesty, in all their justi∣fiable Pretensions, as might, upon the only sure Foundation, that of the Love and Interest of your Subjects, establish your Government,
and as strongly unite the Hearts of all your Subjects to You, as is that of, &c. The Lord Churchill left a Letter to the same purpose; which runs thus: SIR, SInce Men are seldom suspected of Sincerity when they act con∣trary to their Interests; and tho' my dutiful Behaviour to Your Majesty in the worst of Times (for which I acknowledge my poor Services much over-paid) may not be sufficient to incline You to a charitable Interpretation of my Actions; yet, I hope, the great Advantage I enjoy under Your Majesty, which I can never expect in any other Change of Government, may reasonably con∣vince Your Majesty, and the World, that I am acted by an higher Principle when I offer that Violence to my Inclination and Interest, as to desert Your Majesty at a Time when Your Affairs seem to challenge the strictest Obedience from all Your Subjects; much more from one who lies under the greatest Personal Obligations imaginable to Your Majesty. This, SIR, could proceed from no∣thing but the inviolable Dictates of my Conscience, and a necessary Concern for my Religion, (which no good Man can oppose,) and with which, I am instructed, nothing ought to come in Competi∣tion. Heaven knows with what Partiality my dutiful Opinion of Your Majesty hath hitherto represented those unhappy Designs, which Inconsiderate and Self-Interested Men have framed against Your Majesty's true Interest, and the Protestant Religion: But as I can no longer join with such, to give a Pretence, by Conquest, to bring them to effect; so I will always, with the hazard of my Life and Fortune, (so much Your Majesty's due,) endeavour to preserve Your Royal Person, and Lawful Rights, with all the tender Con∣cern, and dutigl Respect, that becomes, &c. Upon this, the Army retreated to Reading, and the King ve∣ry disconsolate, returned on the 26th in the Evening to Lon∣don, from whence the Princess Ann of Denmark, his second Daughter, was gone privately the Night before; and if she had not left a Letter behind her, to shew the reason of her Retreat, the King's own Guards had in all probability torn all the Popish Party to pieces, upon a surmize that they had made her away. The Letter she left for the Queen, was as follows. MADAM, I Beg Your Pardon, if am so deeply affected with the surprizing News of the Prince's being gone,The Princess Ann's Letter to the Queen. as not to be able to see You, but to leave this Paper to express my humble Duty to the King and Your Self; and to let You know that I am gone to absent my
self, to avoid the King's Displeasure, which I am not able to bear, either against the Prince, or my self: And I shall stay at so great a Distance, as not to return before I hear the happy News of a Re∣concilement: And as I am confident the Prince did not leave the King with any other Design, than to use all possible Means for His Preservation; so I hope You will do me the Justice to believe, that I am not capable of following him for any other End. Never was any one in such an unhappy Condition, so divided between Du∣ty and Affection, to a Father and an Husband; and therefore I know not what to do, but to follow one, to preserve the other. I see the general Falling off of the Nobility and Gentry, who avow to have no other End, than to prevail with the King to secure their Religion, which they saw so much in danger by the violent Counsels of the Priests; who, to promote their own Religion, did not care to what Dangers they exposed the King: I am fully per∣suaded that the Prince of Orange designs the King's Safety and Preservation; and hope all Things may be composed without more Blood-shed, by the Calling of a Parliament. God grant a happy End to these Troubles, that the King's Reign may be prosperous, and that I may shortly meet You in perfect Peace and Safety: Till when, let me beg you to continue the same favourable Opinion that You have hitherto had of, &c. The first thing done upon the King's Return, was the turn∣ing Sir Edward Hales out from being Lieutenant of the Tow∣er, and then to order Writs to be issued out for the sitting of a Parliament the 15th of Jan. but that was too late, and the Nation was now in such a Ferment, that neither this pace, nor a Proclamation of the 30th of Nov. requiring the Elections to be done in a fair and legal manner, signified any thing, so that the King now began to provide for his Fami∣ly, and first he sent away the Prince of Wales to Portsmouth, but my Lord Dartmouth would not suffer him to be carried into France, yet the Queen soon after found a way to convey him, her self, and divers others thither; And indeed it was high time, for Scotland now was as much alarmed as England, and some of the Nobility and Gentry were sent up with a Petition for a free Parliament,ivers aces seized for the Use of the Prince of O∣range. all the North of England was secured, for the Prince; Newcastle receiving the Lord Lum∣ey▪ and declaring for a free Parliament, and the Protestant Religion, York was in the hands of the associated Lords; The Garison of Hull seized the Lord Langdale then Governor a Papist, and the Lord Montgomery, and disarmed some Popish Forces newly sent thither, and then declared as New Castle had done. Bristol was seized by the Earl of Shrewsbury and Sir John Guise, Plymouth had long before submitted to the Prince of Orange; and in short, the Popish party was become so contemptible in London, that on Thursday, Dec. 6th. there
was an Hue and Cry after Father Petre, publickly cried and sold in the Streets of London; but this was not the worst nei∣ther; for about the same time came out this following Decla∣ration in the Name of the Prince of Orange. By His Highness WILLIAM HENRY, Prince of Orange. A Third Declaration. VVE have,The P. of O's Third Decla∣ration. in the Course of our Life, more parti∣cularly by the apparent Hazards both by Sea and Land, to which we have so lately exposed our Person, given to the whole World so high and undoubted Proofs of our fervent Zeal for the Protestant Religion, that we are ful∣ly confident no true English Man and good Protestant can entertain the least Suspicion of our firm Resolution, rather to spend our dearest Blood, and perish in the Attempt, than not to carry on the blessed and glorious Design, which, by the Favour of Heaven, we have so successfully begun, to rescue England, Scotland and Ireland from Popery and Sla∣very, and in a Free Parliament to Establish the Religion, the Laws, and the Liberties of these Kingdoms on such a sure and lasting Foundation, that it shall not be in the Power of any Prince for the future to introduce Popery and Tyranny. Towards the more easie compassing this great Design, we have not been hitherto deceived in the just Expectation we had of the Concurrence of the Nobility, Gentry, and Peo∣ple of England with us, for the Security of their Religion, and the Restitution of the Laws, and the Re-establishment of their Liberties and Properties: Great Numbers of all Ranks and Qualities having joined themselves to us; and others, at great distances from us, have taken up Arms, and declared for us. And which we cannot but particular∣ly mention, in that Army which was raised to be the Instru∣ment of Slavery and Popery, many (by the special Provi∣dence of God) both Officers and common Soldiers, have been touched with such a feeling Sense of Religion and Ho∣nour, and of true Affection to their Native Country, that they have already deserted the illegal Service they were en∣gaged in, and have come over to Us, and have given us full Assurance from the rest of the Army, That they will cer∣tainly follow this Example, as soon as with our Army we shall approach near enough to receive them without ha∣zard of being prevented or betray'd. To which end, and that we may the sooner execute this just and necessary De∣sign
we are engaged in for the Publick Safety and Deliver∣ance of these Nations, We are resolved, with all possible Diligence, to advance forward, that a Free Parliament may be forthwith called, and such Preliminaries adjusted with the King, and all things first settled upon such a Foot ac∣cording to Law, as may give us and the whole Nation just Reason to believe the King is disposed to make such neces∣sary Condescension on his part, as will give entire Satisfa∣ction and Security to all, and make both King and People once more Happy. And that we may effect all this in the way most agreeable to our Designs, if it be possible, without the Effusion of any Blood except of those execurable Criminals, who have justly forfeited their Lives, for betraying the Religion, and sub∣verting the Lawes of their Native Country, We do think fit to declare, That as we will offer no Violence to any but in our own necessary Defence; so we will not suffer any Injury to be done to the Person even of any Papist, pro∣vided he be found in such Place, and Condition, and Cir∣cumstances at the Laws require. So we are resolved and do declare, That all People who shall be found in open Arms, or with Arms in their Houses, or about their Persons, or in any Office Civil or Military, upon any pretence whatsoever, contrary to the known Laws of the Land, shall be treated by Us and our Forces not as Soldiers and Gentlemen▪ but as Robbers, Free-Booters and Banditti, they shall be incapable of Quarter, and entirely delivered up to the Discretion of our Soldiers. And we do further declare, That all Persons, who shall be found any ways aiding or assisting to them, or shall march under their Command, or shall join with, or submit to them in the Discharge or Execution of their il∣legal Commission or Authority, shall be looked upon as Partakers of their Crimes, Enemies to the Laws, and to their Country. And whereas we are certainly informed, That great num∣bers of Armed Papists have of late resorted to London and Westminster, and Parts adjacent, where they remain, as we have reason to suspect, not so much for their own Security, as out of a wicked and barbarous Design to make some de∣sperate Attempt upon the said Cities, and the Inhabitants, by Fire or a sudden Massacre, or both, or else to be the more ready to join themselves to a Body of French Troops, design∣ed, if it be possible, to land in England, procured of the French King by the Interest and Power of the Jesuits in pursuance of the Engagements, which, at the Instigation of that pestilent Society, his most Christian Majesty, with one of his Neighbouring Princes of the same Communion, has entred into for the utter Extirpation of the Protestant Reli∣gion
out of Europe. Though we hope we have taken suck effectual Care to prevent the on, and secure the other, that, by God's Assistance, we cannot doubt but we shall defeat all their wicked Enterprises and Designs. We cannot however forbear, out of our great and ten∣der Concern we have to preserve the People of England, and particularly those great and populous Cities, from the cruel Rage and blood Revenge of the Papists, to require and expect from all the Lords Lieutenants, and Justices of the Peace, Lord-Mayors, Mayors, Sheriffs, and other Magi∣strates and Officers, Civil and Military, of all Counties, Cities and Towns in England, especially of the County of Middlesex, and Cities of London and Westminster, and Parts adjacent, that they do immediately disarm and secure as by Law they may and ought, within their respective Coun∣ties, Cities, and Jurisdictions, all Papists whatsover, as Persons at all times, but now especially, most dangerous to the Peace and Safety of the Government, that so not only all Power of doing Mischief may be taken from them, but that the Laws, which are the greatest and best Security, may resume their Force, and be strictly executed. And we do hereby likewise declare, That we will protect and defend all those who shall not be afraid to do their Duty in Obedience to these Laws. And that for those Magistrates and others, of what Condition soever they be, who shall refuse to assist Us, and in Obedience to the Laws, to execute vigorously what we required of them, and suffer themselves at this juncture to be cajoled or terrified out of their Duty, we will esteem them the most Crimi∣nal and Infamous Men, Betrayers of their Religion, the Laws, and their Native Country, and shall not fail to treat them accordingly, resolving to expect and require at their Hands the Life of every single Protestant that shall perish, and every House that shall be burnt and destroyed by Trea∣chery and Cowardize. Given under Our Hand and Seal at Our Head-Quar∣ters at Sherburn Castle, the 28th of Novemb. 1688. WILLIAM HENRY, Prince of Orange. By His Highness's Special Command, C. HUYGENS.
This was the boldest Attempt that ever was made by a pri∣vate Person, for it's certain the Prince knew nothing of it, & disowned it as soon as he heard thereof, but it did him good Service; and I have been told, that Captain B. boldly carry'd it to my Lord Mayor, and charged him with the Execution of it. But before this, the Marquess of Hallifax, my Lord Not∣tingham, and the Lord Godolphin had been sent by the King and Council to treat with the Prince of Orange, and to adjust the Preliminaries, in order to the holding of a Parliament, who (Decemb. 8.) sent these Proposals to him. Proposals sent by the King, to the Prince of Orange, then at Windsor. SIR, THE King commanded us to acquaint you,K. J's Propo∣sals to the Pr. of Orange. That he obser∣veth, all the Differences and Causes of Complaint, alledged by your Highness, seem to be referred to a Free Parliament. His Majesty, as he hath already declared, was resolved, before this to call one; but thought that in the present state of Affairs, it was advisable to defer it till Things were more composed: Yet seeing that his People still continue to desire it, He hath put forth His Proclamation in order to it, and hath issued his Writs for the Calling of it. And to prevent any Cause of Interruption in it, he will consent to every thing that can be reasonably required for the Security of all those that come to it. His Majesty hath therefore sent us to attend your Highness, for the adjusting of all Matters that shall be agreed to be necessary to the Freedom of Elections, and the Security of Sitting; and is ready to enter immediately into a Treaty in order to it. His Majesty proposeth, That in the mean time the respective Armies may be returned within such Limits, and at such distance from London, as may prevent the Apprehensions that the Parlia∣ment may be in any kind disturbed; being desirous that the Meeting may be no longer delayed, than it must be by the usual and neces∣sary Forms. Hungerford, December 8. 1688. Hallifax, Nottingham, Godolphin.
To this His Royal Highness the Prince of Orange, returned this Answer. VVE,The Prince's Answer. with the Advice of the Lords and Gentlemen As∣sembled with Vs, have, in Answer, made these fol∣lowing Proposals. I. That all Papists, and such Persons as are not qualified by Law, be disarmed, disbanded and removed from all Employments, Civil and Military. II. That all Proclamations that reflect upon Vs, or at any that have come to Vs, be recalled: And that, if any Persons, for having assisted Vs, have been Committed, that they be forthwith set at Liberty. III. That for the Security and Safety of the City of London, the Custody and Government of the Tower be immediately put into the Hands of the said City. IV. That if His Majesty should think fit to be in London, du∣ring the Sitting of the Parliament, that We may be there also, with an equal number of our Guards: And if His Majesty shall be pleased to be in any Place from London, whatever Distance He thinks fit, that We may be at the same Distance; and that the respective Armies be from London Forty Miles, and that no further For∣ces be brought into the Kingdom. V. And that, for the Security of the City of London, and their Trade, Tilbury-Fort be put into the hands of the City. VI. That a sufficient part of the Publick Revenue be assigned Vs, for the Support and Maintenance of our Troops, until the sit∣ing of a Free Parliament. VII. That, to prevent the Landing of the French, or other Foeign Troops, Portsmouth may be put into such Hands as by His Majesty and Vs shall be agreed on. The King was so far from being pleased with this Answer, that he resolved to withdraw from London, as he did private∣ly aboard a little Smack; but he and his Company were seized by the Inhabitants of Fevershm, and somewhat rough∣ly handled before they came to be known, whence the King came to Rochester; but before this he gave the E. of Feversham Directions by Letter, to disband the Army: Which Letter was to this effect: My Lord, THings being come to that Extremity,K. J's Letter to the E. of Fev rsham. that I have been forced to send away the Queen, and my Son, the Prince of Wales, that they might not fall into the Enemy's Hands, which they must have done if they had staid; I am obliged to do the same thing▪ in hopes it will please God, out of his Infinite Mercy to this unhappy Nation, to touch their Hearts again with true Loyalty and Honour.
If I could have relied on all my Troops, I might not have been put to the Extremity I now am in; and would at least have had one Blow for it. But though I know there are many valiant and brave Men among you; both Officers and Soldiers; yet you know, that both you, and several of the General Officers and Soldiers, and Men of the Army, told me, It was no ways advisable for me to venture my self at their Head, or to think to fight the Prince of Orange with them. And now there remains only for me to thank you, and all those, both Officers and Soldiers, who have stuck to me, and been truly Loyal. I hope you will still retain the same Fidelity to me: And though I do not expect you should expose your selves, by resisting a Foreign Army, and a poisoned Nation; yet I hope your former Prin∣ciples are so inrooted in you, that you will keep your selves free from Associations, and such pernicious things. Time presseth, so that I can add no more. JAMES Rex. The Earl of Feversham, presently after the Receipt of this Letter, disbanded 4000 Men, which was all the Army he had then with him, and under his Command: After which, he sent this Letter to the Prince of Orange: SIR, HAving received,The E. of Fe∣versham's Let∣ter to the Pr. of Orange. this Morning, a Letter from His Majesty, with the Vnfortunate News of his Resolution to go out of England, I thought my self obliged, being at the Head of his Army, and having received his Orders to make no Opposition against any Body, to let Your Highness know it, with the Advice of the Officers here, so soon as was possible, to hinder the Effusion of Blood. I have ordered already, to that purpose, all the Troops that are under my Command; which shall be the last Order they shall receive from Feversham. This was directly a clear and full Abdication, or Desertion of the Army, which unavoidably necessitated them to submit to the Prince of Orange, they having no Body to lead or head them against him. And it is not conceivable how they could avoid entring into an Association, or Oath of Allegiance, to the Prince, now the King had left them, without exposing them∣selves, by resisting a Foreign Army, and a poisoned Nation: For neither would the Nation continue long without a Prince; nor would any Person who should have succeeded in that Ca∣pacity, have suffered them to live within his Government, without giving him Security by Oath, for their Submission and Loyaly to him. So that the whole Design of this Letter seems to be the Sowing Division in the Nation, that when he
left us, we might not unite or settle our selves under the other, but be divided by our Principles; that so we might the more easily reduce us again into the State we are in, when the Prince first designed his Expedition against England. The King being gone (as above-said, Decem. 11. in the Morning) the Principal Officers of the Army about the Town thereupon met about 10 a Clock at Whitehal, and sent an Ex∣press to the Prince of Orange, to acquaint him with the De∣parture of the King, and to assure him▪ that they would assist the Lord Mayor, to keep the City quiet till his Highness came, and made the Souldiery to enter into his Service. Much about the same time, the Lords Spiritual and Tempo∣ral about the Town came to Guildhal, and sending for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, made the following Declartion. The Declaration of the Lords Spiritual and Tempo∣ral in and about the Cities of London and West∣minster, Ambled at Guild Hall, the 14th of December, 1688. VVE doubt not but the World believes, that in this great and dangerous Conjuncture we are hear∣tily and zealously concerned for the Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties and Properties of the Subject. And we did reasonably hope, that the King having issued out his Proclamation and Writs for a Free Parliament, we might have rested secure under the Expect∣ation of that Meeting: But His Majesty having withdrawn himself, and, as we apprehend, in order to his Departur out of this Kingdom, by the pernicious Counsels of Persons ill affected to our Nation and Roligion, we cannot, without being wanting to our Duty, be silent under those Calami∣ties, wherein the Popish Counsels, which so long prevailed, have miserably involved these Realms. We do therefore unanimously resolve to apply our selves to his Highness the Prince of Orange, who with so great Kindness to these Kingdoms, so vast Expence, and so much Hazard, hath under∣taken, by endeavouring to procure a Free Parliament, to rescue us (with as little effusion of Christian Blood as possible) from the eminent Dangers of Popery and Slavery. And we do hereby declare, That we will with our utmost Endeavours assist his Highness, in the obtaining such a Par∣liament with all speed, wherein our Laws, our Liberties and Properties may be secured, the Church of England in particular, with a due Liberty to Protestant Dissenters, and in general the Protestant Religion and Interest, over the
whole World, may be supported and encouraged, to the Glory of God, the Happiness of the Established Government in these Kingdoms, and the Advantage of all Princes and States in Christendom, that may be herein concerned. In the mean time we will endeavour to preserve, as much as in us lies, the Peace and Security of these great and po∣palous Cities of London and Westminster, and the parts adja∣cent, by taking care to disarm all Papists, and secure all Jesuits and Romish Priests, who are in or about the same. And if there be any thing more to be performed by Us, for promoting his Highnes's Generous Intentions for the Publick Good, we shall be ready to do it as occasion requires. Signed— W. Cant. T. Ebor.

Whereas His Majesty hath privately this Morning with∣drawn himself, we the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, whose Names are hereunto Subscribed, being Assembled in Guild-Hall in London, having agreed upon and signed a Declaration of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in and about the Ci∣ties of London and Westminster, Assembled at Guildhall the 11th of Decemb. 1688. do desire the Right Honourable the Earl of Pembrook, the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Weymouth, the Right Reverend Father in God the Lord Bishop of Ely, and the Right Honourable the Lord Culpeper, forthwith to attend His Highness the Prince of ORANGE with the said Declaration, and at the same time to acquaint his Highness with what we have further done at this Meeting. Dated at Guild-Hall, Decemb. 11. 1688.
The same Day the Lieutenancy of London signed this follow∣ing Address to the Prince of Orange at Guild-Hall, and sent it by Sir Robert Clayton, Kt. Sir Will. Russel, Sir Basil Firebrace, Kts. and Charles Duncomb, Esq May it please your Highness, VVE can never sufficiently express the deep Sense we have conceived and shall ever retain in our Hearts, that your Highness has exposed your Person to so many Dangers by Sea and Land, for the Preservation of the Protestant Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, without such unparalleled Undertaking, we must probably have suffered all the Miseries that Popery and Sla∣very could have brought upon us. We have been greatly concerned, that before this Time we had not any reasonable Opportunity, to give Your Highness and the World a Real Testimony, That it has been our firm Resolution to venture all that is dear to us, to attain those Glorious Ends which your Highness has proposed for Restoring and Settling these Distracted Na∣tions. We therefore now unanimously present to your Highness our Just and Due Acknowledgments for that happy Relief you have brought to us; and that we may not be wan∣ting in this present Conjuncture, we have put our selves into such a posture, that (by the Blessing of GOD) we may be capable to prevent all ill Designs, and to pre∣serve this City in Peace and Safety, till your Highness's happy Arrival. We therefore humbly desire, that your Highness will please to repair to this City with what convenient speed you can, for the perfecting the Great Work which your High∣ness has so happily begun, to the general Joy and Satisfa∣ction of us all. The Prince of Orange in the mean time, finding the Kings Troops (now without Head) to commit many Disorders, put forth the following Declaration. By the Prince of Orange, A Declaration. VVHereas We are informed,P. of Or. his Declaration. That divers Regiments, Troops and Companies have been incouraged to dis∣perse themselves in an Vnusual and Vnwarrantable Manner, whereby the Publick Peace is very much disturbed; We have thought fit hereby to require all Colonels and Commanders in Chief of such Regiments, Troops and Companies, by Beat of Drum or
otherwise, to call together the several Officers and Soldiers belon∣ging to their respective Regiments. Troops and Companies in such Places as they shall find most convenient for their Rendezvous, and there to keep them in good Order and Discipline. And We do likewise direct and require all such Officers and Soldiers forthwith to repair to such Place as shall be appointed for that purpose by the Respective Colonels or Commanders in Chief whereof speedy No∣tice is to be given unto Vs for our further Orders. Given at Our Court at Henly, Decemb. 13. 1688. Prince of ORANGE. From Henly he advanced by easie Marches towards London, being invited thither (as already noted) by diverse Noblemen and Citizens; as the King was also by some Lords to return, which he did on Sunday the 16th in the Evening, a Sett of Boys following him through the Streets, and made some Huzza's, while the rest of the People silently looked on. But before the King's Return the Privy Council and Peers met, and made this Order on the 14th. VVE the Peers of this Realm, Assembled with some of the Lords of the Privy Council, do hereby require all Irish Officers and Soldiers to repair forthwith to the respective Bodies to which they do or did lately be∣long; and do hereby declare, that behaving themselves peaceably, they shall have Subsistence pay'd them, till they shall be otherwise provided for or imployed. And the said Officers and Soldiers are to deliver up their Arms to some of the Officers of the Ordnance, who are to deposite the same in the Stores in the Tower of London. And We do require and command all Justices of the Peace, Constables, and other Officers whom it may concern, that they apprehend and seize all such Soldiers as shall not re∣pair to their respective Bodies, and that they be dealt with as Vagabonds.

It was high time to put out this Order; for on Thursday Dec. 13. about Three in the Morning, there was a terrible Allarm, That the Irish in a desperate Rage, were approaching London, putting Man, Woman and Child to the Sword, which made the People all rise, placing Lights in their Win∣dows from top to bottom, and every Man guarding his own Door with his Musquet charged with Powder and Ball; and all the Traindbands of the City were in Arms; so that there was nothing heard but Shooting and Beating of Drums all Night. And, what is very strange, this Allarm spread it self over the face of the whole Kingdom, and all that were able to carry Arms vowed the Defence of their Lives, Laws, Religion and Liberties, and stood resolved to destroy all the Irish and Pa∣pists in England, in case any Injury were offered them; but few Papists suffered in their Persons, only their Houses were generally rifled under a pretence of searching for Arms and Ammunition. The Prince, who was now at VVindsor, had sent M. Zulestein to the King, to desire him to continue at Rochester; but mis∣sing him, the King came to VVhitehal, and from thence sent the Lord Feversham with a Letter to the Prince to VVindsor, to invite him to St. James's, with what number of Troops he should think convenient to bring along with him. But the Prince referring the Consideration of the Subject-Matter of the Letter to the Peers about him, they concluded that the shortness of the Time could admit of no better Expedient, that the King might be desired to remove with a reasonable Distance from London; and Ham, an House belonging to the Dutchess of Lauderdale, was pitch'd upon, and a Note or Paper drawn up to that purpose, which was ordered to be delivered after the Prince's Guards were in Possession of the Posts about VVhitehall; the Substance whereof was as follows: WE desire you the Lord Marquess of Hallifax,The P. of  Message to the King. the Earl of Shrewsbury, and the Lord Delamere, to tell the King, That it is thought convenient, for the great Quiet of the City, and the great Safety of his Person, that he do remove to Ham, where he shall be attended by his Guards, who will be ready to preserve him from any Disturbance. Given at VVindsor, the Seventeenth Day of De∣cember. 1688. VV. Prince de Orange.
The Guards, who were commanded by Count Solmes, made it 10 a Clock at Night before they could reach London: And the Kings Guards then on Duty, not being very forward to dislodge, it was Twelve before the Lords could deliver the said Paper; of which they first sent this Account to Se∣cretary Middleton. My Lord, THere is a Message to be delivered to his Majesty, from the Prince, which is of so great Importance, that we, who are charged with it, desire we may be immediately admitted; and therefore desire to know where we may find your Lordship, that you may introduce, My Lord, &c. Hallifax. Shrewsbury, Delamere. He accordingly presently introduced them, the King being by that time in Bed; where they made an Apology for co∣ming at so unseasonable a Time; and delivering him the Pa∣per, the King read it, and said, He would comply with it. Upon this the Lords humbly desired he would remove so early as to be at Ham by Noon, to prevent Meeting the Prince in his Way to London, where he was to come the same Day. His Majesty readily agreed to this too; and asked, whether he might not appoint what Servants should attend him: To which the Lords replied, That it was left to him, to give Order in that as he pleased; and so they took their Leave of him. When they were gone as far as the Privy-Chamber, the King sent for them again, and told them, he had forgot to acquaint them with his Resolutions before the Message came, to send my Lord Godolphin next Morning to the Prince, to propose his going back to Rochester; he finding, by the Mes∣sage M. Zulestein was charged with, the Prince had no Mind he should be at London; and therefore he now desired he might rather return to Rochester, than go to any other place. The Lords replied, That they would immediately send an Account to the Prince, of what His Majesty desired; and they did not doubt of such an Answer as would be to his Satis∣faction. Accordingly, they sent to him, who was then at Sion-House; and before 8 next Morning there came a Letter from M. Bentink, by the Prince's Order, agreeing to the King's Proposals of going to Rochester. Hereupon he went (the Guards being made ready, and Boats prepared) that Night to Gravesend, in his own Barge, attended by the Earl of Arran, and some few others.
The same Day, being Dec. 18. about Three in the After∣noon, His Highness the Prince of Orange came to St. James's, attended by Monsieur Schomberg, and a great Number of the Nobility and Gentry; and was entertained with a Joy and Concourse of the People which appeared free, and uncon∣strained; and all the Bells in the City were rung, and Bon∣fires made in every Street. The King continued at Rochester till Dec. 23. and then, a∣bout 1 or 2 in the Morning, he privately withdrew himself; and taking only with him Mr. Ra. Sheldon and Mr. Delabady, he went towards Dover, and embarked in a Vessel laid ready for his Transportation to France. The Queen, who went hence the 10th, arrived at Calais on the 11th, and was in great pain (not knowing what had happen'd in England) for the King, whom she expected every Tide. But the King▪ before he withdrew the second time, wrote, and left behind him the following Letter, which was afterwards printed by his Order in London. His Majesty's Reasons for withdrawing himself from Rochester; writ with his own Hand, and ordered by him to be Published. THE World cannot wonder at my withdrawing my Self now this second time.K. James's Reasons for withdrawing himself. I might have expected somewhat better Usage after what I writ to the Prince of Orange, by my Lord Feversham, and the Instructions I gave him. But instead of an Answer, such as I might have ho∣ped for, what was I to expect, after the Usage I received, by the making the said Earl a Prisoner, against the Practice and Law of Nations; The sending his own Guards at 11 at Night, to take Possession of the Posts at Whitehall, with∣out advertising me in the least manner of it; The sending to me at One of the Clock at Mid-night, when I was in Bed, a kind of Order, by three Lords, to be gone out of my Palace before Twelve the same Morning? After all this, How could I hope to be safe, so long as I was in the Power of one who had not only done this to me, and invaded my Kingdoms, without any just Occasion given him for it; but that did, by his own Declaration, lay the greatest Aspersion on me that Malice could invent, in that Clause of it which concerns my Son? I appeal to all that know me, nay, even to himself, that, in their Consciences, neither he, nor they, can believe me in the least capable of so unnatural a Villa∣ny; nor of so little common Sense, to be imposed on in a Thing of such a Nature as that. What had I then to expect from one, who, by all Arts, hath taken such pains to make
me appear as Black as Hell to my own People, as well as to all the World besides? What Effect that hath had at home, all Mankind hath seen, by so general a Defection in my Army, as well as in the Nation, amongst all sorts of People. I was born free, and desire to continue so: And tho' I have ventured my Life very frankly, on several Occasions, for the Good and Honour of my Country, and am as free to do it again, (and, which I hope I shall yet do, as old as I am, to redeem it from the Slavery it is like to fall under;) yet I think it not convenient to expose my self to be so secured, as not to be at liberty to effect it; and for that Reason to withdraw, but so as to be within Call whenso∣ever the Nation's Eyes shall be opened, so as to see how they have been imposed upon by the specious Pretences of Liberty and Property. I hope it will please GOD to touch their Hearts, out of his infinite Mercy, and to make them sensible of the ill Condition they are in, and bring them to such a Temper, that a Legal Parliament may be called; and that, amongst other things which may be necessary to be done, they will agree to Liberty of Conscience for all Prote∣stant-Dissenters; and that those of my own Persuasion may be so far considered, and have such a Share of it, as they may live peaceably and quietly, as English Men and Christi∣ans ought to do, and not be obliged to transplant them∣selves; which would be very grievous, especially to such who love their Country. And I appeal to all Men, who are considering Men, and have had Experience, whether any thing can make this Nation so great and flourishing as Li∣berty of Conscience: Some of our Neighbours dread it. I could add much more, to confirm what I have said, but now is not the proper Time. Rochester, Dec. 22. 1688. The Prince being come to London, the Common-Council met, and, in the Name of the City, returned him Thanks, and congratulated him upon his great and glorious Expedition. Then was there an Association signed at St. James's, by near 60 Peers: And at the Princes Request, the Lords met at Westminster; who desired him to take the Publick Admini∣stration upon him, and agreed a onvention should meet on the 22d of January. The Prince also put out the follow∣ing Paper.
WHereas the Necessity of Affairs does require speedy Advice, We do desire all such Persons as have served as Knights, Citizens or Burgesses in any of the Parliaments, that were held during the Reign of the late King CHARLES the Second, to meet Vs at St. James's, upon Wednesday the Six and Twen∣tieth of this Instant December, by Ten of the Clock in the Morn∣ing. And We do likewise desire, That the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen of the City of London would be present at the same time; and that the Common-Council would appoint Fifty of their Number to be there likewise: And hereof We desire them not to fail. Given at St. James's the Three and twentieth Day of December, 1688. W. H. Prince of Orange. By His Highness's especial Command. G. HUYGENS. The Commons attended accordingly, and concurring fully with the Lords, the Prince sent out his Circular Letters for the meeting of the said Convention. With which we shall con∣clude the Affairs of this Memorable Year: Only, I must ob∣serve, that it proved fatal to one of the most generous and bravest Princes of Europe, the Elector of Brandenburgh, who died May 10. in the 69th Year of his Age. THis Year cannot be begun with any thing more memo∣rable than with the Meeting of the Convention Par∣liament, which was on Jan. 22d. and the manner of their Pro∣ceedings: Upon which Occasion the Prince of Orange directed to them the following Letter. My Lords and Gentlemen, I Have endeavoured to the utmost of my Power, to per∣form what was desired from me in order to the Publick Peace and Safety; and I do not know that any thing hath been omitted which might tend to the preservation of them, since the Administration of Affairs was put into my Hands. It now lieth upon you to lay the Foundations of a firm security for your Religion, your Laws, and your Li∣berties. I do not doubt, but that by such a full and free Repre∣sentative of the Nation, as is now met, the Ends of my De∣claration will be attained: And since it hath pleased God
hitherto to bless my good Intentions with so great success, I trust in him, that he will compleat his own Work, by sending a Spirit of Peace and Union to influence your Counsels, that no interruption may be given to an happy and lasting Settlement. The dangerous Condition of the Protestants in Ireland, requiring a large and speedy succour, and the present state of things abroad, oblige me to tell you, that next to the danger of Vnseasonable Divisions amongst our selves, nothing can be so fatal as too great a delay in your Consultations: The States by whom I have been enabled to rescue this Nation, may suddenly feel the ill Effects of it, both by being too long deprived of the Service of their Troops which are now here, and of your early Assistance against a powerful Ene∣my, who hath declared a War against them: And as Eng∣land is by Treaty already engaged to help them upon such Exigencies, so I am consident that their chearful Concur∣rence to preserve this Kingdom with so much hazard to themselves, will meet with all the Returns of Friendship and Assistance, which may be expected from you as Pro∣testants and English Men, when ever their Condition shall require it. Given at St. James's the 22d Day of January, 1688. Will. H. P. d' Orange. Their first Act was an Address of Thanks to the Prince of Orange, for what he had successfully undertaken for the Nati∣on, a desire he should continue the Administration of Publick Affairs, and take particular Care of the Affairs of Ireland; with a promise on their part to dispatch the Affairs that lay under their Consideration with utmost Application; to which having received a very kind Answer on the Prince his part, both Houses immediately fell to their Work, and after 8 days the Commons past the following Vote. Resolv'd, That King James II. having endeavour'd to subvert the Constitution of this Kingdom, by breaking the Original Contract between King and People, and by the Advice of Jesuits, and other wicked Persons, having violated the Fundamental Laws, and ha∣ving withdrawn himself out of this Kingdom, hath abdicated the Government, and that the Throne is thereby vacant. The Declaration of the Commons being sent up to the Lords for their Concurrence, that House entered into a De∣bate upon it, and so far agreed with it, that they had only by way of amendment put in the word Deserted instead of Abdi∣cated,
and left out and that the Throne is thereby vacant, and sent a Message to the Commons to acquaint them therewith: But they were so far from approving of what the Lords had done, that they proceeded to give their Reasons against the Amendment, alledging that they could not allow the word De∣serted instead of Abdicated (which their House had made choice of) because it did not fully express the Conclusion necessarily inferred from the Premises, viz. That K. James II. had endeavoured to subvert the Constitutions of the King∣dom, as before in the former part of the Declaration, to which their Lordships had agreed, seeing Deserted only re∣spected withdrawing, whereas Abdicated did respect the whole. Neither were the Commons better pleased with the Lords for leaving out the last words, And that the Throne is thereby vacant, and the Commons did so much the more in∣sist upon it, because that if they should admit of the Lord's Amedment, that the King had only deserted the Government, yet even thence it would follow that the Throne was vacant as to King James II. deserting the Government, being in true Con∣struction, deserting the Throne. Besides, the Commons did conceive there was no necessity to prove to their Lordships, or any other, that the Throne was vacant, since the Lords themselves both before and after their meeting in the said Convention, had addrest the Prince of Orange to take upon him the Administration of Publick Affairs, both Civil and Military, and had appointed a Day of publick Thanksgiving to be observed throughout the Kingdom; by all which the Commons understood, it was their Lordships Opinion, that the Throne was vacant, and that they signified so much there∣by to the People of England: To which they added, that it was from those who were upon the Throne of England, where there was any fault, that the People of England ought to receive Protection, and to whom for that Cause, they owed the Allegiance of Subjects, but there being none then from whom they expected Regal Protection, and to whom for that cause they owed the Allegiance of Subjects, the Com∣mons conceived the Throne vacant. The Issue of these Rea∣sons was a Conference held on Feb. 5. between the two Houses, who appointed Managers accordingly. The Lords insisted hard upon their Amendments, and some of them run so far upon the Debate, that they did in a manner seem to recede from the Premises which their House had allowed of, viz. That the King had endeavoured to subvert the Constitutions of the Kingdom, as before; but the Commons stood stoutly to their Declaration, and to the forementioned Reasons ad∣ded a great many fine things to back the Argument, which 'twere pity to curtail any way, and I have not room to in∣sert the whole, but in conclusion the Conference ended in
appearance with less likelihood of Agreement than when it first began. Yet though there was some further struggle made in the upper House for the Interest of the late King, at length it was by Majority of Voices, Feb 7th, agreed to by the Lords to send a Message to the Commons that they had agreed to the Vote sent them up Jan. 25th, touching which they had had a free Conference the Day before, without any alteration, So that the next thing that came under Consi∣deration was the form of Government to be establish'd. I do not remember that a Commonwealth was mentioned to be set up at all in either House, though Father Orleans is plea∣sed to say so in his History of the Revolutions of England; the two main things then to be considered was, whether to set up a Regency; or to continue a Regal Dignity in a new Subject: But the former of the two being well known to be attended with many publick Evils, it was at last concluded for the latter, and that in Favour of the Prince of Orange, our Deliverer, and her Royal Princess who was immediate Heiress. In pursuance of this, a Declaration was drawn up, in order to such an Establishment, as that the Religion, Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom might not again be in danger, and for vindicating and asserting the Ancient Rights and Li∣berties of the People, in these Words. VVHereas the late King James the Second by the Assi∣stance of divers evil Counsellors,The English Declaration of Right. Judges and Mini∣sters employ'd by him, did endeavour to subject and extirpate the Protestant Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom. By assuming and exercising a Power of dispensing with, and su∣spending of Laws, and the execution of Laws, without Consent of a Parliament. By committing and prosecuting divers worthy Prelates, for humbly petitioning to be excus'd from concurring to the said assum'd Power. By issuing and causing to be executed a Commission under the Great Seal, for erecting a Court, call'd, The Court of Commissi∣on for Ecclesiastical Affairs. By levying Money for and to the use of the Crown, by pretence of Prerogative, for other time and in other manner, than the same was granted by Parliament. By raising and keeping a standing Army within the Kingdom in time of Peace, without Consent of Parliament; and Quartering Soldiers contrary to Law. By causing several good Subjects, being Protestants, to be dis∣armed, at the same time when Papists were both arm'd and em∣ploy'd contrary to Law.
By violating the Freedom of Elections of Members to serve in Parliament. By Prosecution in the Court of King's-Bench, for Matters and Causes cognizable only in Parliament, and by divers other Arbi∣trary and Illegal Courses. And whereas of late Years, partial, corrupt and unqualified Persons have been returned and served on Juries in Trials, and particularly divers Jurors in Trials for High-Treason, which were not Freeholders. And excessive Bail hath been required of Persons committed in Criminal Cases, to elude the Benefit of the Laws made for the Liberty of the Subject. And excessive Fines have been imposed. And illegal and cruel Punishments inflicted. And several Grants and Promises made of Fines and Forfei∣tures before any Conviction or Judgment against the Persons upon whom the same were to be levied. All which are utterly and directly contrary to the known Laws and Statutes, and Freedom of this Realm. And whereas the late King James the Second, having abdica∣ted the Government, and the Throne being thereby vacant. His Highness the Prince of Orange (whom it hath pleased Al∣mighty God to make the Glorious Instrument of delivering this Kingdom from Popery and Arbitrary Power) did (by the Ad∣vice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and divers principal Persons of the Commons) cause Letters to be written to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, being Protestants, and other Letters to the several Counties, Cities, Vniversities, Buoughs and Cinque-Ports for the chusing of such Persons to represent them, as were of right to be sent to Parliament, to meet and sit at West∣minster, Jan. 22d. 1688. in order to such an Establishment, as that their Religion, Laws and Liberties, might not again be in danger of being subverted, upon which Letters, Elections have been accordingly made. And thereupon the said Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Com∣mons, pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections, being now assembled in a full and free Representation of this Nation, taking into their most serious Consideration the best means for at∣taining the Ends aforesaid, do in the first place (as their Ance∣stors in like Cases have usually done) for the vindicating their Ancient Rights and Liberties, declare, That the pretended Power of suspending Laws, or the execution of Laws by Regal Authority, without Consent of Parliament, is il∣legal. That the pretended Power of dispensing Laws, or the executing of Laws, by Regal Authority, as it hath been assumed and exer∣cised of late, is illegal.
That the Commission for erecting the late Court of Commissi∣oners for Ecclesiastical Causes, and all other Commissions and Courts of the like Nature, are illegal and pernitious. That levying of Money to or for the use of the Crown, by pre∣tence of Prerogative, without Grant of Parliament, for longer time, or in other manner, than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal. That it is the Right of the Subjects to petition the King, and all Commitments and Prosecutions for such petitioning are il∣legal. That the raising and keeping a standing Army within the King∣dom in time of Peace, unless it be by Consent of Parliament, is against Law. That the Subjects being Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Condition, and as allowed by Law. That the Election of Members of Parliament ought to be free. That the Freedom of Speech, or Debates, and Proceedings in Parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parliament. That excessive Bail ought not to be requir'd, nor excessive Fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual Punishments inflicted. That Jurors ought to be duly impannell'd and return'd, and Ju∣rors which pass upon Men in Trials for High-Treason ought to be Freeholders. That all Grants and Promises of Fines and Forfeitures of par∣ticular Persons before Conviction, are illegal and void. And that for Redress of all Grievances, and for the amend∣ing, strengthening, and preserving of the Laws, Parliaments ought to be held frequently. And they do claim, demand, and insist upon all and singular the Premises, as their undoubted Rights and Liberties; and that no Declarations, Judgments, Doings, or Proceedings to the pre∣judice of the People in any of the said Premises, ought in any wise to be drawn hereafter into Consequence or Example. To which demand of their Rights, they are particularly encou∣raged by the Declaration of his Highness the Prince of Orange, as being the only means for obtaining a full Redress and Remedy therein. Having therefore an intire Confidence, that his said Highness the Prince of Orange will perfect the Deliverance so far ad∣vanced by him, and will still preserve them from the violation of their Rights, which they have here asserted, and from all other Attempts upon their Religion, Rights and Liberties; The said Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons assembled at Westminster do resolve, That WILLIAM and MARY Prince and Princess of Orange be, and be declared King and Queen of England, France and Ireland, and the Dominions thereunto belonging, to hold the
Crown and Royal Dignity of the said Kingdoms and Dominions, to them the said Prince and Princess during their Lives, and the Life of the Survior of them; and that the sole and full Exer∣cise of the Regal Power be only in, and executed by the said Prince of Orange, in the Names of the said Prince and Princess during their Lives; and after their Deceases, the said Crown and Royal Dignity of the said Kingdoms and Dominions to be to the Heirs of the Body of the said Princess; and for default of such Issue, to the Princess Anne of Denmark, and the Heirs of her Body; and for default of such Issue, to the Heirs of the Body of the said Prince of Orange. And the said Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons do pray the said Prince and Princess of Orange to accept the same accordingly. And that the Oaths hereafter mentioned, be taken by all persons of whom the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy might be re∣quired by Law, instead of them; and that the said Oaths of Alle∣giance and Supremacy be abrogated. I A. B. Do sincerely Promise and Swear, That I will be Faithful, and bear true Allegiance to Their Majesties King WILLIAM and Queen MARY. So help me God. I A. B. Do Swear, That I do from my Heart Abhor, Detest, and Abjure, as Impious and Heretical, this damnable Do∣ctrine and Position, That Princes Excommunicated or Deprived by the Pope, or any Authority of the See of Rome, may be de∣posed or murthered by their Subjects, or any other whatsoever. And I do declare, That no Foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or Potentate, hath or ought to have any Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority, Preheminence or Authority, Ecclesiasti∣cal or Spiritual, within the Realm. So help me God. This Declaration being tendered to the Prince and Princess of Orange,P. and P. of Orange pro∣claimed K. and Q. or England▪ and the Conditions being accepted by both, they were soon after proclaimed King and Queen of England, ac∣cording to the Tenor of a Proclamation drawn by the Con∣vention for that very purpose, and so they took a peaceable Possession of the English Crown; the few Soldiers of Dumbar∣ton's Regiment that sometime after revolted, being quickly brought to submit, and no other Punishment inflicted upon them than to be sent into Holland, without any dealcation of their Pay. But the King having now done his Work in England, 'twas his next Thoughts to make sure of Scotland,
whither he had sent a Body of Men sometime since, under the Command of Major General Mckay, and where, not∣withstanding, the Duke of Gourdon still held Edinburgh Castle, and that there was a disposition in the Northern Inhabitants of that Kingdom, to adhere to the late King, a Convention met also, and notwithstanding King James writ to them as well as King William, yet the formers Letter was so far from having any effect upon them in his Favour, that the Throne of Scotland was declared vacant, and an Act of Recognition drawn up in the Form following. THat whereas James the Seventh,The Scot. De∣clarat. of Right. being a professed Papist, did assume the Regal Power, and act as a King, without ever taking the Oaths required by Law; whereby every King, at his Access to the Government, was obliged to swear to maintain the Protestant Religion, and to Rule the People according to the laudable Laws; and by the Advice of wicked Counsellors, did invade the Funda∣mental Constitutions of the Kingdom of Scotland, and al∣ter'd it from a Legal limited Monarchy, to an Arbitrary and Despotick Power; and in a publick Proclamation as∣serted an Absolute Power to annul and disable all Laws; particularly by arraigning the Laws establishing the Prote∣stant Religion, and to the Violation of the Laws and Liber∣ties of the Kingdom. By erecting publick Schools and Societies of the Jesuits, and not only allowing Mass to be publickly said, but also converting Protestant Chapels and Churches to publick Mass-Houses, contrary to the express Laws against saying and hearing of Mass. By allowing Popish Books to be printed and disposed by a Patent to a Popish Printer, designing him Printer to his Majesty's Houshold, Colledge, and Chappel, contrary to Law. By taking the Children of Protestant Noblemen and Gen∣tlemen, and sending them abroad to be bred Papists; and be∣stowing Pensions on Priests to pervert Protestants from their Religion, by Offers of Places of Preferments. By disarming Protestants, while at the same time he em∣ploy'd Papists in Places of the greatest Trust, both Civil and Military, &c. and entrusting the Forces and Magazines in their hands. By imposing Oaths contrary to Law. By exacting Money without Consent of Parliament, or Convention of Estates. By levying and keeping up a Standing Army in time of Peace, without Consent of Parliament, and maintaining them upon free Quarter.
By employing the Officers of the Army as Judges throughout the Kingdom; by whom the Subjects were put to death, without legal Trial, Jury, or Record. Bp imposing exorbitant Fines, to the value of the Parties Estates, exacting extravagant Bail, and disposing Fines and Forfeitures before any Process or Conviction. By imprisoning Persons without expressing the Reason, and delaying to bring them to Trial. By causing several Persons to be prosecuted, and their Estates to be forfeited, upon Stretches of old and forfeited Laws, upon weak and frivolous Pretences, and upon lame and defective Proofs, as particularly the late Earl of Argyle, to the Scandal of the Justice of the Nation. By subverting the Rights of the Royal Boroughs, the Third Estate of Parliament, imposing upon them not only Magistrates, but also the whole Town, Council, and Clerks, contrary to their Liberties and express Charters, without any pretence of Sentence, Surrender, or Consent. So that the Commissioners to Parliaments being chosen by the Magistrates and Councils, the King might in effect as well nominate that entire Estate of Parliament: Besides, that many of the Magistrates by him put in were Papists; and the Boroughs were forced to pay Money for the Letters im∣posing those illegal Magistrates upon them. By sending Letters to the Chief Courts of Justice, not only ordering the Judges to stop sine die, but, also comman∣ding them how to proceed in Cases depending before them, contrary to the express Laws; and by changing the Na∣ture of the Judges Patents ad vitam, or culpam, into a Commission de bene placito, to dispose them to a Compliance of Arbitrary Courses, and turning them out of their Offices, if they refus'd to comply. By granting personal Protections for Civil Debts, contrary to Law. All which were Miscarriages of King James, utterly and directly contrary to the known Laws, Freedoms and Sta∣tutes of the Realm of Scotland. Upon which Grounds and Reasons the Estates of the Kingdom of Scotland did find and declare, That K. James the 7th being a profess'd Papist, did assume the Regal Power, &c. (as at the beginning) whereby he had forfeited the Right of the Crown, and the Throne was become va∣cant. Therefore in regard his Royal Highness, then Prince of Orange; since King of England, whom it pleas'd God to make the glorious Instrument of delivering these Kingdoms from Popery and Arbitrary Power, by Advice of se∣veral Lords and Gentlemen of the Scots Nation then
at London, did call the Estates of this Kingdom to meet upon the Fourteenth of March last, in order to such an Establishment, as their Religion, Laws, and Liberties, might not again be in danger of being subverted. The said Estates being at that time assembled accordingly in a full and free Representative of the Nation, taking into their most serious Consideration the best Means for attain∣ng the Ends aforesaid, did, in the first place, as their Ancestors in the like Cases had usually done, for the Vin∣dicating and Asserting their Ancient Rights and Liberties, declare, That by the Law of Scotland, no Papist could be King or Queen of the Realm, nor bear any Office whatever therein; nor that any Protestant Successor could exercise the Regal Power, till he or they had sworn the Coronation-Oath. That all Proclamations asserting an Absolute Power to null and disable Laws, in order to erecting Schools and Col∣ledges for Jesuits; converting Protestant Churches and Chappels into Mass-Houses, and the allowing Mass to be said. That the allowing Popish Books to be printed and disper∣sed, was contrary to Law. That the taking the Children of Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, and keeping them abroad to be bred Papists; the making Funds and Donations to Popish Schools and Colledges, the bestowing Pensions on Priests, and the se∣ducing Protestants from their Religion by offers of Places and Preferment, was contrary to Law. That the disarming of Protestants, and the employing Papists in the greatest Places of Trust both Civil and Mili∣tary, &c. was contrary to Law. That the imposing an Oath without Authority of Parlia∣ment, was contrary to Law. That the raising of Money without Consent of Parlia∣ment or Convention was contrary to Law. That the imploying Officers of the Army as Judges, &c. was contrary to Law. That the imposing extraordinary Fines, &c. was con∣trary to Law. That the imprisoning of Persons without expressing the Reasons, &c. was the same. That the prosecuting and seizing Mens Estates as for∣feited upon stretches of the old and obsolete Laws, &c. was contrary to Law. That the nominating and imposing Magistrates, &c. up∣on Burroughs, contrary to their express Charters, was the same.
That the sending Letters to the Courts of Justice, or∣daining the Judges to desist from determining of Causes, and ordaining them how to proceed in Causes depending before them, &c. was contrary to Law. That the granting of personal Protections, &c. was the same. That the forcing the Subjects to depose against them∣selves in capital Causes, however the Punishment were re∣stricted, was contrary to Law. That the using Torture without Evidence, or in ordinary Crimes, was contrary to Law. That the sending of an Army in a Hostile manner into any part of the Kingdom, in time of Peace, and exacting Locality and free Quarter, was the same. That charging the Subjects with Law-burroughs at the King's Instance, and imposing Bonds without Authority of Parliament, and the suspending Advocates for not appear∣ing when Bonds were offer'd, was contrary to Law. That the putting Garrisons into private Mens Houses in time of Peace, without Authority of Parliament, was illegal. That the Opinions of the Lords of the Sessions in the two Cases following, were illegal, viz. That the concerting the demand of Supply of a forefaulted Person, although not given, was Treason. That Persons refusing to discover their private Thoughts in relation to points of Treason, or other Mens Actions, are guilty of Treason. That the fining Husbands for their Wives withdrawing from Church, was illegal. The Prelates and Superiority of any Office in the Church above Presbyter, is, and has been a great and unsupporta∣ble burthen to this Nation, and contrary to the Inclinati∣ons of the generality of the People, ever since the Refor∣mation; they having reformd Popery by Presbytery, and therefore ought to be abolish'd. That it is the Right and Privilege of the Subject to pro∣test for remedy of Law, to the King and Parliament against Sentences pronounc'd by the Lords of the Sessions, pro∣vided the same do not stop executions of the said Sentences. That it is the Right of the Subject to petition the King, and that all Prosecutions and Imprisonments for such peti∣tioning are and were contrary to Law. Therefore for the redress of all Grievances, and for the amending, strengthening and preserving the Laws, they claim'd that Parliaments ought to be frequently call'd and allow'd to it, and freedom of Speech and Debate allow'd the Members.
And then they farther claim'd and insisted upon all and sundry the Premises, as their undoubted Rights and Liber∣ties, and that no Declaration or Proceedings to the preju∣dice of the People in any of the said Premises ought in any wise to be drawn hereafter in Example; but that all For∣feitures, Fines, loss of Offices, Imprisonments, Banishments, Prosecutions, Persecutions and rigorous Executions be con∣sider'd and the Parties redress'd. To which demand of their Rights, and redress of their Grievances, they took themselves to be encourag'd by the King of England's Declaration for the Kingdom of Scotland in October last, as being the only means for obtaining a full Redress and Remedy therein. Therefore, Forasmuch as they had an entire Confidence that His Majesty of England would perfect the Deliverance so far advanc'd by him, and would still preserve them from the Violation of the Rights which they had asserted, and from all other Attempts upon their Religion, Laws and Liberties▪ The said Estates of the Kingdom of Scotland had resolv'd, That William and Mary, King and Queen of England, be de∣clared King and Queen of Scotland, to hold the Crown and Royal Dignity of the said Kingdom to them the said King and Queen, during their Lives and the longest Liver of them, and that the sole and full Exercise of the Power be only in, and exercis'd by him the said King, in the Names of the said King and Queen, during their Lives. And after their Decease, that the said Crown and Royal Dignity of the said Kingdom be to the Heirs of the Body of the said Queen. Which failing, to the Princess Anne of Denmark, and the Heirs of her Body; which also fail∣ing, to the Heirs of the Body of the said William, King of England. And then withal they pray'd the said King and Queen to accept the same accordingly. It was also declar'd by the Instrument, That the Oath hereafter mention'd should be taken by all Protestants, by whom the Oath of Allegiance or any other Oaths and De∣clarations might be requir'd by Law instead of it; and that the Oath of Allegiance, and all other Oaths and Declarati∣ons should be abrogated. The Oath was but short, and conformable to that which was prescrib'd in England. I A. B. Do sincerely promise and swear, That I will be faithful and bear true Allegiance to Their Majesties King William and Queen Mary. So help me God.
This Act being brought to perfection, the Earl of Argyle, with other Commissioners, were dispatch'd away with it for London, to present it to the King and Queen, and to take their Oath; which being done, the same day as Their Maje∣sties were Crowned King and Queen of England, they were also proclaimed King and Queen of Scotland;P. and P. pro∣claimed in Scotland. and May 11th the Earl of Argyle, with other Commissioners, tender'd the Coronation Oath to their Majesties, which was distinctly pro∣nounced word by word by the Earl, while their Majesties repeated the Sentences after him, holding up their Right∣hands all the while,K. and Q. take the Scotch Oath. according to the Custom of Scotland; but when the King came to that Clause in the Oath, We shall be careful to root out Hereticks, he declared, that he did not mean by those words, that he was under any obligation to become a Persecutor: To which the Commissioners replied, That nei∣ther the meaning of the Oath, nor the Law of Scotland, did im∣port it. Whereupon the King said, That he took the Oath in that sense, and called the Commissioners and other's there present to be Witnesses of his so doing. Then the Convention was turn'd into a Parliament, who abolish'd Episcopal Church-Government, and restor'd the Presbyterian one, which with other concurring Causes, made things somewhat uneasie in that Kingdom for a time. For tho Edenburgh Castle was, June 13th, surrender'd to Sir John Lamier, yet Dundee gathered strength in the North for the late King, between whose Party and Mackays, past several Actions, and the first was July 16th near Blaine, in the County of Athol, where Mackay with 4000 Foot, and 4 Troops of Horse and Dragoons, attack'd Dundee,Dundee slain. who had 6000 Foot and 100 Horse on his side, and between whom there was a very obstinate Fight which lasted till night: But though Mackay lost the Field, and retreated that night to Sterling, after having lost a great many Men, yet the Death of Dundee, who was slain in this Battel, did more than compensate the other's Loss, seeing he was the Life of that Party, who dwindled away ever after, and were worsted every where, and particularly once, and again at St. Johnstown; in the last Conflict of which, the single Regi∣ment of the Earl of Angus, under the Command of Lieute∣nant Colonel Cleeland, gave so entire a Defeat to their whole Power, which amounted to near 4000 Men, that they never appeared in any considerable Body ever after, and many of the Chief of them thereupon made their submission, though this hapned with the Death of that brave Lieutenant Colonel; who, if it had pleased God, deserved a better Fate. But how prosperous soever King William's Affairs went in Britain,Tyrconnel sent for K. James to Ireland. where still there were a little rascally Conspiracies against him, they did not do so in Ireland, for there Tircon∣nel was setting all things in order to secure that Kingdom for
the late King; with whom Hambleton, a profest Papist, who by a fatal Mistake was sent over from England, to induce him to lay down the Sword, traiterously joined in; and so the Opportunity for the present was lost, and an advantage given to the late King, to endeavour that way to regain the rest of his lost Dominions, since he was like to receive little As∣sistance from any other Prince, save what the French King might do. For the Emperor, to whom he wrote his Com∣plaint, and whose Assistance he craved, was so far from com∣plying with his Desires, that though he pittied his Condition, yet he reprimanded him for▪ his Folly, as you may see by his Letter to him, upon the Occasion, which was to this purpose. The Emperor of Germany's Account of K. James's Misgovernment in joining with the K. of France (the common Enemy of Christendom) in his Letter to K. James. LEOPOLD, &c. WE have received your Majesties Letter dated from St. Germains the 6th of February last by the Earl of Carlingford the Envoy in our Court:The Empe∣ror's Letter to the late K. James. by whom we have under∣stood the Condition your Majesty is reduced to, and that you being deserted after the landing of the Prince of Orange, by your Army, and even by the Domestick Servants, and by those you most confided in, and almost by all your Subjects; you have been forced by a sudden flight to provide for your own safety, and to seek shelter and protection in France; lastly, that you desire Assistance from us for the recovering your Kingdoms: We do assure your Majesty, that assoon as we heard of this severe Turn of Affairs we were mo∣ved at it, not only with the common sense of humanity, but with much deep impressions suitable to the sincere Affection which we have always born to you, and we were heartily sorry that at last that was come to pass, which (though we hoped for better things) yet our own sad thoughts had suggested to us would en∣sue. If your Majesty had rather given credit to the friendly Re∣monstrances that were made you, by our late Envoy the Count De Kaunitz, in our Name, than the deceitful Insinuations of the French, whose chief aim was by fomenting continual Divisions between you and your People, to gain thereby an opportunity to in∣sult the more securely over the rest of Christendom; and if your Majesty had put a stop, by Force and Authority, to their many in∣fractions of the Peace, of which, by the Treaty at Nimeguen, you are made the Guarantee, and to that end entred into Consulta∣tions with us, and such others as have the like just Sentiments in this matter, we are verily perswaded that by these means you should have in a great measure quieted the minds of the People,
who were so much exasperated through their aversion to our Religi∣on, and the publick Peace had been as well preserved in your King∣doms as here in the Roman Empire: but now we refer it even to your Majesty, to judge what condition we can be in to afford you any assistance, who being not only engaged in a War with the Turks, but finding our selves at the same time unjustly and barbarously attack'd by the French, contrary to, and against the Faith of Treaties, they then knowing themselves secure of England; and this ought not to be concealed, that the greatest Injuries which have been done to our Religion, have flowed from no other than from the French themselves; who not only esteem'd it lawful for them to make perfidious Vows with the sworn Enemies of the Ho∣ly Cross, tending to the Destruction both of us and the whole Chri∣stian World, in order to the checking our endeavours which were undertaken for the Glory of God, and to stop those Successes which it hath pleased the Almighty God to give us hitherto, but further have heaped one Treachery upon another even within the Empire it self: The Cities of the Empire which were surrendred, upon Articles signed by the Dauphin himself, have been exhausted by excessive Impositions: and after their being exhausted have been plundered, after plundering have been burned and raced; the Pa∣laces of Princes, who in all times, and even in the most destructive Wars, have been preserved, are now burnt to the ground, the Churches are robb'd, and such as submitted themselves to them are in a most barbarous manner carried away as Slaves: In short, it is become a Diversion unto them to commit all manner of Insolence and Cruelty in many places, but chiefly in Catholick Countries, exceeding the Cruelties of the Turks themselves, who having impo∣sed an absolute necessity upon us to secure our selves and the holy Roman Empire by the best means we can think on, and that no less against them than against the Turks, we promise our selves from your Justice readily to assent to this, that it ought not to be imputed to us if we endeavour to procure by a just War that secu∣rity to our selves which we could not hitherto obtain by so many Treaties, and that in order to the obtaining thereof we take mea∣sures for our mutual Defence of Preservation, with all those who are equally concerned in the same Design with us. It remains that we should beg of God that he would direct all things to his Glory, and that he would grant your Majesty true and solid Comforts un∣der this your great Calamity. We embrace you with the tender affection of a Brother. At Vienna the 9th of April, 1689. But though his Imperial Majesty declined to give him any helping hand,The late K. James lands in Ireland. and that other Catholick Princes, in imitation of his Example, made it no difficulty to do so too, yet he was so elated with an Opinion of the Bravery and Fidelity
of the Irish, that he embark'd at Brest, and landed in that Kingdom, March 12th, with about 1800 Auxiliary French. This pace of the French, besides the English Nation's desire, the King's Obligations to his Allies, and many other weighty Reasons, brought forth a Declaration of War against the French King, which was to this purpose. Their Majesties Declaration against the French King. WILLIAM R. IT having pleased God to make Us the happy Instrument of Rescuing these Nations from great and imminent Dan∣gers, and to place Us upon the Throne of these Kingdoms, we think our selves obliged to endeavour to the uttermost to promote the Welfare of our People, which can never be effectually secured, but by preventing the Miseries that threaten them from abroad. When we consider the many unjust Methods the French King hath of late years taken to gratifie his Ambition, that he has not only invaded the Territories of the Emperor, and of the Empire now in Amity with us, laying waste whole Countries, and destroying the Inhabitants by his Ar∣mies, but declared War against our Allies without any Pro∣vocation, in manifest Violation of the Treaties confirmed by the Guaranty of the Crown of England; we can do no less than joyn with our Allies in opposing the Designs of the French King, as the Disturber of the Peace, and the com∣mon Enemy of the Christian World. And besides the Obligations we lie under by Treaties with our Allies, which are a sufficient Justification of Us for ta∣king up Arms at this time, since they have called upon us so to do, the many Injuries done to Us aud to our Sub∣jects, without any Reparation, by the French King, are such, that (however of late years they were not taken no∣tice of, for Reasons well known to the World) neverthe∣less we will not pass them over without a publick and just Resentment of such Outrages. It is not long since the French took Licences from the English Governour of Newfound-Land, to Fish in the Seas upon that Coast, and paid a Tribute for such Licences, as an Acknowledgment of the sole Right of the Crown of England to that Island; and yet of late, the Encroachments of the French upon our said Island, and our Subjects Trade and Fishery, have been more like the Invasions of an Ene∣my than becoming Friends, who enjoy'd the Advantages of that Trade only by Permission.
But that the French King should invade our Charibbee Islands, and possess himself of our Territories of the Pro∣vince of New-York and of Hudson's-Bay, in a hostile manner, seizing our Forts, burning our Subjects Houses, and enrich∣ing his People with the spoil of their Goods and Merchan∣dizes, detaining some of our Subjects under the Hardship of Imprisonment, causing others to be inhumanely kill'd, and driving the rest to Sea in a small Vessel, without Food or Necessaries to support them, are Actions not becoming even an Enemy; and yet he was so far from declaring him∣self so, that at that very time he was negotiating here in England by his Ministers a Treaty of Neutrality and good Correspondence in America. The Proceedings of the French King against our Subjects in Europe, are so notorious, that we shall not need to en∣large upon them; his countenancing the Seizure of English Ships by French Privateers, forbidding the Importation of a great part of the Product and Manufactures of our Kingdom, and imposing exorbitant Customs upon the rest, notwith∣standing the vast Advantage he and the French Nation reap by their Commerce with England, are sufficient Evidences of his Designs to destroy the Trade, and consequently to ruin the Navigation, upon which the Wealth and Safety of this Nation very much depends. The Right of the Flag, inherent in the Crown of Eng∣land, has been disputed by his Orders in Violation of our Sovereignty of the Narrow Seas, which in all Ages has been asserted by our Predecessors, and we are resolv'd to maintain, for the Honour of our Crown, and of the English Nation. But that which must nearly touch us, is his unchristian Prosecution of many of our English Protestant Subjects in France, for Matters of Religion, contrary to the Law of Nations, and express Treaties, forcing them to abjure their Religion by strange and unusual Cruelties, and imprisoning some of the Masters and Seamen of our Merchants Ships, and condemning others to the Gallies, upon pretence of ha∣ving on Board, either some of his own miserable Prote∣stant Subjects, or their Effects. And lastly, As he has for some years last past, endeavoured by Insinuations and Pro∣mises of Assistance, to overthrow the Government of Eng∣land; so now by open and violent Methods, and the actual Invsion of Our Kingdom of Ireland, in support of our Sub∣jects in Arms and in Rebellion against Us, he is promoting the utter Extirpation of our good and loyal Subjects in that our Kingdom.
Being therefore thus necessitated to take up Arms, and relying on the help of Almighty God in our just Underta∣king, We have thought fit to Declare, and do hereby De∣clare War against the French King, and that We will, in Conjunction with our Allies, vigorously prosecute the same by Sea and Land (since he hath so unrighteously begun it) being assured of the hearty Concurrence and Assistance of our Subjects in support of so good a Cause; hereby wil∣ling and requiring our General of our Forces, our Com∣missioners for executing the Office of High Admiral, our Lieutenants of our several Counties, Governours of our Forts and Garisons, and all other Officers and Soldiers un∣der them, by Sea and Land, to do, and execute all acts of Hostility in the Prosecution of this War against the French King, his Vassals and Subjects, and to oppose their Attempts: Willing and Requiring all our Subjects to take notice of the same, whom we henceforth strictly forbid to hold any Correspondence or Communication with the said French King, or his Subjects. And because there are remaining in our Kingdoms many of the Subjects of the French King, We do Declare and give our Royal Word, That all such of the French Nation as shall demean themselves dutifully towards us, and not correspond with our Enemies, shall be safe in their Persons and Estates, and free from all molesta∣tion and trouble of any kind. Given at our Court at Hampton-Court the 7th day of May. 1689, in the first Year of our Reign. God save King William and Queen Mary. I shall not meddle with the Declaration, nor pretend to defend the Justice of it (for I think it carries its own light with it) but return to the late King; who, upon his Arrival in Ireland, found himself not mistaken as to the Number of his Party, which was indeed very strong, and almost all the Country at his Devotion; the greatest part of the Protestants having before, upon their disappointment of Arms, Ammu∣nition, Commissions, and some Forces from England, either deserted it, or those that staid behind very unable to make any Resistance: However, they made some shew of forming an Army, but were quickly routed by Lieutenant General Ha∣milton, at a place called Drummore, Mar. 15th, which gave occasion to the late King, and Tirconnel, to take away the Arms and Horses of the rest of the Protestants,Protestants disarm'd in Ireland. except those that fled to Londonderry, and some few that went towards Iniskilling, who about March 25th had Arms and Ammunition brought them by Captain James Hamilton, and who demean∣ed themselves with the greatest Bravery that ever Men did under their forlorn Circumstances.
It would be too tedious to enter upon the Particulars of the Siege of Derry, and how much they baffled the Irish Army almost in all their Encounters with them. I shall only ob∣serve that Major Baker whom they chose Governour, after Colonel Lundy had play'd the Rogue and was turn'd out, and Mr. Walker the Minister who was entrusted with the Stores, behaved themselves beyond expectation, and so did Colonel Mecklenburg, who succeeded Governour after Baker's Death, and will with the rest of their brave Officers and Soldiers, be for ever remembred by all true Englishmen with the greatest deference and respect, as they themselves will have occasion while they live, with indignation to think of Lundy's baseness in preventing the Relief sent them of two Regiments under Colonel Richards and Colonel Gunningham, who returned back out of the Lough of Derry without doing any thing, and were both broke for their pains. Yet for all this misfortune, nei∣ther a formidable Enemy without, nor a more terrible one that had crept within their Walls, viz. Famine, which daily swept away multitudes of the Garison, could bring them to yield; but they outbraved all till the long-delay'd Succors at last, under the Command of Major-General Kirk, arrived in the Lough. But alas! they were now in worse plight than before; for, like Tantalus, they had the sight of the desi∣red Fruit, but could not reach to eat: for whether through the crossness of the Winds, as was given out, or for some other base ends, the Ships lay at least two Months in the Lough, before the Dartmouth Frigat at last forced her way, and got to the Town, which was followed with the raising of the Siege, which happened on July 31th. This was no small mortification to the Irish, who met with as bad Success in another Enterprise of theirs against the Iniskillingers; For, but the day before, about 6000 of them being upon their March,The Irish routed by the Iniskil∣lingers, and Mackarty made a Pri∣soner. under the Command of Major-General Mackarty, an experienced Officer among them, the Iniskillingers advanced near 20 miles to meet them, and at a place called Newton Butler fought and routed them, took Mackarty Prisoner, and kill'd and drowned nigh 3000 of them, though themselves were not above 2000 in all, and lost not above 20 Men, with about 50 wounded. While these things were doing in Ireland, the King gave out Commissions in England, for raising 18 Regiments of Foot and 5 of Horse, for the Irish Service, with that Success, that the Levies were almost all compleat in 6 weeks, and in July most of them were commanded for Chester, in order to be shipped off for Ireland. On Thursday, August 8th, being a∣bout 10000 Men, Horse and Foot, and Duke Schomberg for their General, they were embarked at Highlake, but by con∣trary Winds were detained there till the 12th, when the
Wind coming fair, the Bonadventure Frigat, Captain Hopson Commander and Commodore, fired a Gun, and put his Light in the Main Top-mast Shrouds, as a Signal for sailing. They were about 90 Vessels in all, of all sorts, and were under fail by 6 in the morning, steering directly toward Carrigfergus, and on the 13th in the Afternoon arrived in that Bay, where the Army presently landed;D. Schomberg lands in Ire∣land. and after the General had sent out several Parties, to discover the Posture of the Enemy, and to scour the Country, he marched the Army to Belfast, and on Wednesday, May 20th, and the day following, sen several Regiments towards Carrigfergus, with some Cannon and Mortars,Carrigfergus bsieged. which took up their Posts about the Town. Upon this the Enemy beat a Parly, and sent out their Propo∣sitions, which the Duke rejected, and so order'd the Town to be attack'd: Whereupon the Trenches were drawn, and the Mortars and Cannons play'd furiously upon the Town, and the Half-moon that was to the right of the Castle, which made the Besieged, on Friday the 23d, to desire another Par∣ley, but the General would not allow them to march out with the usual Ensigns of Honour, and so they broke off, and the Siege was carried on with great Vigour. Next day Colonel Richards, the Engineer, being wounded in the Trenches the night before, was carried to Belfast, when one Mr. Spring ma∣king his Escape out of the Town, acquainted the Duke that all the Soldiers lay continually on the Walls, so that the Bombs only plagued the Protestants in the Town, as also, that Mac∣karty Moor and Owen Mackarty were the only 2 that hindred the Surrender of the Town, and that they resolved if he stor∣med the Place to retire into the Castle, and had to that end laid up Stores of Provision there, but that they were straitned. Sunday the 25th, and the day following, the Siege went on, and the Guns had made considerable Breaches▪ which the Irish, after other shifts had ailed them, thought to make good by driving a great number of Cattel on the top of them, and which, whilst we killed them there with our firing, they covered with Earth, Stone, and other Rubbish, so that at last after the refusal of another Parley which they desired of the Duke, they hung out a white Flag, and sent their Proposals that were finally agreed to, and they were to march out with their Arms and some Baggage,Carrigfergus surrendred. and to be conducted to the next Irish Garison, which was Newry. Colonel Wharton at the Par∣ley lay before the Breach with his Regiment, and was ready to enter when the Duke sent to command his Men to forbear firing, which with some difficulty they agreed to. The Arti∣cles were scarce agreed on, when Mackarty-Moor was got into the Duke's Kitchin in the Camp, which made the Duke smile, and forbear inviting him to Dinner, saying, If he had staid like a Soldier with his Men, he would have sent to him; but
if he would go and eat with Servants in a Kitchin, let him be doing. Sir William Russel, a Captain in Colonel Coy's Regiment, who was appointed to guard the Irish Garison to Newry, had much ado to secure them from the Rage of the Country People whom before they had plundered, and things went so far, that the Duke himself was forced to ride with his Pistol in his hand among the Irish and Scots to hinder them to murder them;D. Schomberg marched to∣wards Dun∣dak. But when that was over, he march'd the same day, which was the 28th, to Belfast, and 2 days after his own French Regiment of Horse, consisting of 500 Men, joined the Army, which on Saturday the last of August was muster'd, being as follows. Horse, my Lord Devenshire's Regiment, my Lord Delamere's, Colonel Coy's, Duke Schomberg's, and Colonel Levison's Dragoons. Foot, one Batallion of Blew Dutch, Ca∣relsoon's White Dtch, Colonel Beaumont, Colonel Wharton, Lord Drogheda, Lord Lisburn, Lord Meath, Lord Rscommon, Lord Lovelace, Lord Kingston, Duke of Norfolk, Colonel Herbert, Sir Edward Deering, Sir Thomas Gower, Colonel Earl, La Mil∣lieneir, Du Cambon, and La Callimot. The Artillery Horses were most of them yet at Chester, and therefore the Duke or∣dered the greatest part of the Train to be shipt, and the Fleet to sail with them and all other Necessaries to Carlingford Bay, while in the mean time the Duke marched the Army beyond Lisburn, and so onwards through Hilsborough, and encamped at Drummore, where Hamilton had routed the Northern Pro∣testants. The day following they continued their March to Lougbbrilane, where the Iniskilling Horse and Dragoons joined, and were ordered to be an Advance Guard to the Army. But before they could reach Newry, the Irish Troops had deserted and burnt it: yet the General finding an old square Tower in it left standing, he garrison'd it with 50 Men, and from hence they advanced to Dundalk, and encamp'd about a mile North of the Town, in a low moist ground, having the Town and the River towards the W. between them and the Enemy, the Sea towards the S. the Newry Mountains to the E. and to the N. Hills and Bogs intermixt. The bad Weather, con∣stant Marches, and scarcity of Provisions, made our Men al∣ready begin to faint, but here they met with some refresh∣ment of Mutton, and were on the 8th joined by Major Gene∣ral Kirk's; Sir John Hanmor's and Brigadier Stuart's Regi∣ments: But the Fleet, with the Train, &c. failing to come up to Carlingford-Bay (as directed) was a great Discourage∣ment, as well as Disappointment to them for several days; and so much the more, that the General had intelligence by an Engineer that deserted the Enemy, that their Army, con∣sisting of about 20000 Men, was at Drogheda, but 16 Miles from Dundalk, where the Duke halted; and whereof when
the General de Rosne heard, he said he was sure the Duke wanted something, and therefore advised them to make what haste they could to get their Forces in a readiness, some part of which in a day or 2 after moved towards Ardee, a small Town between Drogheda and Dundalk. They continued somewhat in an uncertain Posture till the 20th, when in the morning the General had an Account that the Enemy advanced towards him, and that a Party of 2000 Foot and 1500 Horse were gone beyond the Mountains, to attack the Pass at Newry, and fall into their Rear; but tho' a Party of the Enemies Horse appear'd in the sight of their Camp, and that they had several Battalions of Foot drawn up in order near to theirs, yet they retired upon the advancing of a Party of Horse against them; and the other Detach∣ment hearing my Lord Hewet's Horse and Sir Henry Inglesby's Foot were marching to the Camp, and then in Newry, they wheeled off towards Sligo. But the day following the Ene∣my display'd their Standard Royal, and all drew out both Horse and Foot, having along with them a very handsome Train of Artillery, and a great Body of their Horse advanced towards our Armies Out-works. Several of the English Offi∣cers were for fighting, and would have the Duke send for the Horse home that were a forraging; but his Answer was, Let them alone, we will see what they will do; and notwithstand∣ing he saw them advance within Cannon-shot of his Trenches, yet he said still, he saw no sign of their designing to fight; only once, when he saw them draw their Army into two Lines, he sent Lieutenant-General Douglas to the Camp, to order all the Foot to stand to their Arms, and sent to the Horse, that upon firing 3 Pieces of Cannon, they should re∣turn to the Camp, but till then go on with their foraging, and in the mean time alighted off of his Horse, and sat him down on a little Hill, seeming as if he sleeped, but no doubt his Thoughts were wakeful enough, and busie about the pre∣sent Posture of his Affairs. Douglas had no sooner given the Orders, but the Soldiers with the greatest chearfulness in the world stood to their Arms, and several that had not stir∣red out of their Tents for a week together now readily han∣dled their Muskets, being glad to think they had an oppor∣tunity to beat the Enemy (for they never supposed other∣wise) and so to march towards them from that sad place, which was already very uneasie to them; but in some time the Enemy drew off, and so the matter ended much to the dissatisfaction of the English Soldiers. In a day or two after this,A Conspiracy discovered among the French in the English Army. there was a dangerous Conspira∣cy discovered among some of the French Regiments, and first 4 Soldiers, and a Drummer, then 16 more were apprehended, about some of whom several Letters were found, as one to
Monsieur d' Avaux, and as was said, one to the late King, writ∣ten by one du Plessey, now a private Soldier in M. Gambon's Regiment, but formerly a Captain of Horse in France, from whence he fled for Murther, and by which it did appear he had for some time corresponded with the Enemy: And a further Enquiry being made into the Matter, there was about 200 Men, all Papists, out of the 3 French Regiments, that were secured, disarmed, and sent for England under a Guard, and 6 only of the principal Conspirators (of whom dPles∣sey was one) were hanged upon a pair of Gallows erected near the Camp. But though the Duke was very wary of engaging the Irish Army,The Iniskilli∣ners defeat the Irish near Sligo. because of their Strength and Numbers, it was not so with the Iniskilliners; for on Friday the 27th came News into the Camp, that Colonel Lloyd with about 1000 Iniskillingers, had defeated a Body of the Irish that were marching towards Sligo, consisting of about 5000 Men, killing 700 of them, and taking O Kelly their Commander, and 40 other Officers Prisoners, besides a great Booty of 8000 head of Cattle, with the inconsiderable loss of 14 Men. With this News the General was so taken, that he ordered all the Iniskillin Horse and Foot in the Camp to draw out, and complemented them, so far as to ride all along their Line with his Hat off; then ordered the Dutch Guards and the Iniskillin Foot to draw into a Line, to the Right of the Works at the West-End of the Town, where they made 3 running Firings, which were answered by the Iniskillin Horse from their Camp, and by the great Guns upon the Works, as also from the Ships that lay at the Mouth of the River. But this success was some time after much abated by the loss of Sligo,The Irish take Sligo. and James's Town to the Irish; for Colonel Sarsfield marching with a considerable Body of Men that way, those of James's Town not thinking it tenable, quitted it and marched to Sligo, losing some of their Party, and killing some of the Irish in their Retreat. Next day Sarsfield with his Army came before Sligo, which made Colonel Russel retreat to Ballishannon, and to advise the Foot also to quit the place. But for all this a French Captain with a detach'd Party of Granadiers that had been sent from the main Army, and Co∣lonel Lloyd with the Iniskilliners staid in the Town, and from thence retreated to the two Forts at the end of it, Lloyd in∣to one, and the French Man whose Name was de S. Sanvem with his Granadiers into the other: But though Colonel Lloyd went away that Night with the loss of many of his Men in his Retreat, yet the French Captain having carried in some Provision, and finding 3 Barrels of Powder in the Fort, stood bravely to it: The Nights were then dark, and he fear∣ing the Enemy might make their approaches to the Fort un∣discovered,
got a great many Fir-deals, and dipping the Ends of them in Tar, they made such a light when set on fire, and hung over the Wall, that he discovered the Enemy coming towards them with an Engine they call a Sow; but having killed the Engineer and 2 or 3 more, the rest retired, and he burnt the Engine; Day no sooner appeared, but the Ene∣my were forced to quit a small Field-piece they had planted in the Street, they were so plied with shot from the Fort, by the English, who presently after made a sally, and killed di∣vers of them. But at last their Provision being spent, and there being little or no Water in the Fort, they surrendred it upon honourable Terms; and at their marching over the Bridge Colonel Sarsfield stood with a Purse of Guinea's, and profered every Man that would serve the late King, Horse and Arms with 5 Guinea's advance; yet they all made answer, They would never fight for Papists, exept one, who the very next day after he had got Horse, Arms, and the Gold, brought all off with him. But how disadvantageous soever the loss of the fore-mentioned Places were like to prove to the En∣glish Army, they felt yet a more sensible Blow within them∣selves by the Death of a great many brave Officers and Sol∣diers. Among the former was Sir Edward Deering, a gallant Gentleman,The English at Dundalk die pace. and much lamented in the Army by all that knew him, and a Person who as he contributed more than any Man in the County of Kent, towards bringing about our happy Revolution, so he left a good Fortune in England, pure∣ly to serve the King in this Expedition, as did 3 more of his Brothers, whereof one of them, John▪ Deering, died since at Trangdee▪ and was a very ingenious young Gentleman. Here died also soon after him Colonel Henry Wharton, Brother to the now Lord Wharton, a brisk, bold Man, and had a Regi∣ment which would have followed him any where; and be∣ing withal a comely and handsome Person, he was truly much bemoaned by all that knew him, and so was Sir Thomas Gower, a young Gentleman of pregnant Parts, and C. Hun∣gerford, a hopeful young Gentleman, and of a considerable Fortune, who with a great many other brave Officers were swept away by Death in this unhappy Camp. And for the common Soldiers, there perished in and about Dundalk, at least 1700. and there were about 1970 sick Men shipp'd off at Carlingford and Dundalk, to be transported to Belfast, but of them not above 1100 came ashoar, the rest dying at Sea: Nay, the Mortality was so great, that several Ships had all the Men in them dead, and no body to look after them, whilst they lay in Carrigfergus Bay, and all this, besides some thousands that died in the great Hospital at Belfast that Win∣ter: So that upon a modest Computation of the whole, there was nigh one half of the Army that was transported over,
lost. We will at present leave the surviving part in their Winter Quarters, whither they marched the beginning of Nov. and see how the Campaigns have passed abroad, of which we were unwilling to take any notice hitherto, that they might not interfere with the more immediate Affairs of Bri∣tain, whereof we have now given you the relation. The Confederate Army this Year in Flanders was com∣manded by Prince Waldeck, as that of France was by the Ma∣reschal de Humieres, between whom there passed very little of moment, till about the middle of Aug. when the Prince decamping from Fountain Eveque passed the Sambre, and fell into the Enemies Country; and having taken up his Camp at Thit-Chateau, the French encamped so near him, that the Out-guards were not above half an hours march from one another. The Mareschal on the 25th hearing that a great number of Dutch Horse were out a foraging, attempted to surprize them; to which end he made a motion with his whole Army, which some days before had been reinforced with 6000 Men. The Prince had no sooner notice hereof, but he fired some Pieces of Cannon to give his Foragers notice, as had been agreed upon before: However▪ that did not pre∣vent their being vigorously charged by the French, who took some of them, and their Van-guard advancing attack'd the Village of Forge, where 800 Foot were posted to secure the Foragers, being commanded by the English Colonel Hodges, Lieutenant Colonel Goes, and the Major of the Regiment of Hesse, who for above two hours defended themselves gallant∣ly, but had been overpowered by multitude, had not R Major General of the Cavalry, who was sent to bring back the Lieutenant Generals Webbenum, Marleborough, and d' Hubi, come with their Horse timely to their succour. With that reinforcement they made a retreating Fight against the main of the whole French Army, that came pouring in upon them, till they came to a rising Ground near Walcourt, where they joined a Battalion of Lunemburgers, which had been reinforced by another of Colonel Hales. The French attack'd the Town with great resolution, which lasted an hour and an half; du∣ring which time Prince Waldeck ordered Lieutenant General Alva, to march with 3 Regiments to their relief, the same being also followed by the Guards of the Body, and 2 Eng∣lish Regiments commanded by the Lord of Marleborough; while Major General Slaugeburg advanced almost at the same time with some other Regiments of Foot to the other side of the Town; all which Motions when the French perceived, they retreated in great haste, and some disorder, leaving some Cannon and Ammunition with many Men slain behind them; but they could not be pursued because of the hilliness of the Ground, which without doubt hindred their coming
to a general Battel, and which, in all probability, would not have been to the Advantage of the French, since the Dutch and other Forces were never more eager to have fought it out than at that time. However, they kept their Post all that night, as a token of their Victory: It was said, the French had near 2000 killed and wounded in this Encounter, though they would never acknowledge near so many, among whom were reckoned a good many Officers: The greatest loss on the Confederates side were some of the Foragers killed, and more taken Prisoners in the first Action, so that the number of the slain did not amount to above 300, (but this was minced) of which the chiefest were Lieutenant-Colonel Grimes of the English, the Major of the Dragoons of Zell one Captain, and some inferiour Officers. And thus ended▪ this Campaign in Flanders, without any other memorable Action, saving that the Spaniards demolished a great part of the French Lines, and raised considerable Contributions in the French Territories, whilst they acted in a separate Body from the main Army towards Courtray. But on the German side the Armies were both early in the Field, and quickly enter'd upon Action; and the first place that felt the Effects of the Confederate Arms was Keyserwaert, a Town in the Dutchy of Cleve,Keyserwaert besieged by the Duke of Brandenburg. which in May was block'd up by the Elector of Brandenburg; but the Siege was not so vigo∣rously carried on as some expected, in regard the Besiegers had hopes to make themselves Masters of the Town by fair means: However, they gave the Garison warning, that if they capitulated not before the 25th of the Month, they should have no quarter, with which Menaces seeming not to be much frightned, the Confederates having at length all their Bombs and Artillery ready, began to batter the place in good earnest, and Monsieur du Puy a Refugee Engineer, and the same that had made the last Fortifications of Sedan, had the direction of the Batteries, who managed his business with great application; So that at last, June 29. the Town was surrendred upon Articles,eiserwater surrendred. which in substance were, That the French Garison should march out with all Ensigns of Ho∣nour, and to be convoyed to Luxemburg the nighest way, but all the Cannon to remain in the Town for the Elector's use, and that the Germans were all to go whither they pleased; and for the Regiment of Fustemburg, they should march out with the Governour, and having gone a little way, were to make a stand, and then the Sieur Kaben and Lobmaquen Pri∣soners should retire with their Companies, as well as the Ger∣mans with the Subjects of the Empire, except the Liegois, who should retire or stay in the Regiment as they thought fit, and that the Elector in his own as well as the rest of the Confederates Names, should be obliged to the observation
of all the Capitulation, on condition that the French Gover∣nour made a faithful discovery of all the Mines, Stores, Am∣munition, &c. in the Town, and any Sum of the King's mo∣ney exceeding 5000 Crowns that was found there, was to re∣main at the Elector's and Confederates disposal. In pursu∣ance of these Articles, there marched out of the Town 38 Horse, 30 Dragoons, and 4000 Foot, the Confederates all the while standing to their Arms in Battel-array; there came out 400 Germans, that took an Oath of Fidelity to the Ele∣ctor, who found 58 Pieces of Cannon, 2 Mortars with Stores proportionable, in the place, and of which he made Gene∣ral Schoning Governour. And that every thing at this time might appear to concur for the cementing of the Germans among themselves, the accommodation between the King of Denmark and the Duke of Holstein Gottorp, which was like to imbroil so very much the Affairs of the North, was signed the 30th of June, and Couriers dispatch'd several ways to carry the News, and countermand the Soldiers that were up∣on their March. These things being thus successfully, though slowly accom∣plished, there was a Siege of greater importance now in view,Mentz besie∣ged by the Confederates. and that was of the City of Mentz; we have already gi∣ven you an account of its falling the preceding year into the hands of the French, and now we shall enter upon the man∣ner of the Reduction of it by the German Army, under the Command of the ever renowned and famous Duke of Lor∣rain, who in the Month of June arrived at Frankford, with 20000 old Soldiers with him accustomed to Victory, and there held a Council of War in conjunction with the Elector of Sa∣xony, and other confederate Commanders, where it was then whispered the Siege of Mentz had been resolved on: But however it was, the place was not invested till July 17. and the Trenches not opened till the 22d, the Army as well consisting of Imperialists, as Saxons, Hessians, and Bavarians (which last, after they had left a considerable Force in the black Forest, marched 10000 strong to the Siege) being 50000 and upwards. It will be too tedious to enter upon every particular days Action, and advance in the Siege, but in the general it was thus: The frequent Sallies of the Besieged, in a little time ruined all the Works which the Besiegers had been raising for several days, and that was the reason that it was so long before the Batteries could be in a condition to make Breaches in the Walls, and the Works of the City: On the 16th of Aug. the Besieged made a Sally at high noon, to the number of 2000, upon the Saxon's Quarters, and pre∣sently overturned all before them; but the Imperialists com∣ing up to their Relief, there happened a most terrible slaugh∣ter on both sides, the French losing at least 500 Men, but the
Confederates a great many more. Some few days after, they made three Sallies on one and the same day, and within two hours of one another; in the two first whereof, they made great slaughter among the Besiegers, and cleared the Trench∣es; the third was made with 3000 Men, Drums beating, and Colours flying: now in regard the Besiegers did not expect this third Effort, they were somewhat surprized, and the French at first killed near 600 of them, nail'd 2 Pieces of Cannon, fill'd up the Trenches, and posted their main Guard of Horse in a place where the Besiegers had begun to open their Trenches; but at last the Imperialists having rallied, vigorously repulsed the Enemy, who lost a world of Men in the Action. But for all this great Resistance, the Besiegers, by little and little, made themselves Masters of all the Out-posts, where the Enemy had planted themselves, and raised Bat∣teries in 3 several places, which they secured with good Re∣doubts, from all which they began at once to play, Aug. 28. at the same time plying the Enemy with a vast number of Bombs. It's incredible what a noise and a havock all this made together; while the Cannon opened a Breach, the Be∣siegers advanced towards the Counterscarp, blew up some Mines, and made all things ready for a general Assault. Up∣on the 5th of Sept. a Council of War was held, and the As∣saults being resolved on the next day in 3 several Quarters, every thing was set to rights with all the care that an Affair of so great moment required; and accordingly on the 6th, by break of day, the Cannon began to play upon the City from the Batteries, and continued doing so till 4 in the Af∣ternoon. Then upon the throwing up of a Bomb, which was the Signal agreed on, the Assault began on the Saxon Quarter, at what time the Imperialists, Hessians, and Lunem∣burgers followed; and having fought for 3 hours like Mad∣men, they made themselves Masters of the Counterscarp; while the French, who all this while fired very thick with their Cannon, killed a great number of the Besiegers, and sprung at the same time 3 Mines, that buried several of the Hessians. On the other side, the Imperialists lodged them∣selves to the number of 11000 Foot, and 3000 Horse upon the Bulwark, called Boniface, notwithstanding the Fire and Smoak of their Bombs and Cannons, the Lunenburgers and Saxans fell on also with no less fury, and pursued the Enemy to the very Gates of the City, killing all before them, and sparing no body. But now the Besieged finding all the Out∣works lost, wherein the strength of the Place consisted, their own number much abated, and the Besiegers beginning to fill up the Moat in order to storm the Body of the Town, they beat a Parley, and desired to capitulate; and when all
things were agreed on, they marched out on the 11th of Sept. in the Forenoon, with Drums beating, Colours flying, 6 pie∣ces of Cannon and 2 Mortars, upon condition they would leave behind them in the Town,Mentz sur∣rendred. all the Contributions which they had gathered from the Inhabitants, and adjacent parts. The number of the Garison was found to be extreamly weak∣ned with this severe Siege; but though there was an abso∣lute necessity for the Germans to recover this City out of the French hands, yet the winning of it cost them very dear, some accounts reckoning their Loss to have been no less than 20000 Men, and among them several considerable Officers. But this Account is by much too large, and therefore the more modest Computation has been, that the Imperialists lost upwards of 6000 Men before the place, amongst which are reckoned 4 Princes, and that the French Loss was very near 5000, besides wounded, not above 6000 marching out the Town; whereas it is known the Garison was about 11000 before the Siege: but the Marquess d'Vxelles being unwilling to acknowledge the Victory was owing to the Courage and Gallantry of the Germans, gave out, that it was want of Powder made him surrender. While the Confederates were engaged in the Siege of Mentz, the French, who had before laid the Cities of Spire, Oppenheim, Keidiscum, and Worms, in ashes, and soon after Frankendall, were not now idle, but continued their Disorders in the Pala∣tinate, burning and sacking all along the Towns and Villages,The French burning and ravaging the Palatinate. from Heidelberg to Frankfort. They had resolved to begin with the Capital of the Palatinate, and to that end the Mareschal de Duras drew near it Aug. 4th with a considera∣ble Body, and the City had been infallibly carried (for there were then but 500 Men in Garrison within it) if they had not met by chance with 1000 Men of the Regiment of Wit∣temberg, that were on their March to Bensheim; on the 5th the French fired very thick with their Cannon, from a Re∣doubt called the Star, which had been demolished, and pos∣sest themselves also of an Hill that lay behind the Castle, with a Design to cut off 1000 Men that were coming to the Relief of the place; but they found a way to pass the Neckar, and so got into the City. On the 6th they attempted to storm the place, but with so ill success, that they lost 400 Men, and then they retreated towards Phillipsburg: How∣ever, they some time after attack'd Bruschall, and after some Assaults carried it. But this Acquisition was nothing in com∣parison of the Loss of Mentz, the Consequences whereof they dreaded; and therefore they were no sooner informed of the Surrender of it, but they laid all the Country waste about Mont-Royal, as believing the Confederates would sit down next before that place. They were not also without
some Apprehensions of Luxemburg it self being in danger, by their burning St. Villa Marche, Baboigne, Salme, la Roch, Darbi, and some other Villages in that Dutchy. The Elector of Brandenburg had no sooner made himself Master of Keyserwaert, than that he bent his Thoughts upon the Siege of Bonne.Bonne besie∣ged by the Elector of Brandenburg. But there happened several things that occasioned the retarding of the Execution of it with any great Vigour, though he actually invested it: For the Mar∣quess de Bouflers having drawn a considerable body of Men together, fell with Fire and Sword into the Electorate of Treves, harrasing and burning all before him, and under∣standing that at Cocheim a small Town upon the Moselle, about 5 Leagues from Mont-Royal, there lay about 1600 Men, part∣ly Imperialists, and partly Inhabitants of Treves, he resolved to force the place; and to that purpose, July 25. he march'd thither with all his Force, and having first summoned the Garison to surrender at discretion, but they insisting upon honourable Conditions, he attacked them next morning in 3 several places: But the Imperialists repulsed them several times, and then resolved to abandon the Castle, which had been ruined the preceding Winter, and to retire into the Town, which they thought was more tenable; which being perceived by the Enemy who had attack'd them on that side, they charged them so vigorously, that they entred the Town pell-mell with them at the same time, and drove all the Besieged before them, to the great place, where they made a stand: But being by much overpowered with Numbers, they were in the first heat of the French fury, Man, Woman, and Child, put to the Sword. At last their military Rage being somewhat abated, they made about 300 of them Pri∣soners of War, yet the French did not come off without considerable loss on their side also. This News was no sooner carried to the Elector, but he dispatch'd away Schoning, with between 8 and 10000 Men to seek out Bouflers, and to engage him to fight; who having had notice of his March, retreat∣ed with his Men, so that Schoning returned before Bonne. But this was not the only Interruption the Elector had in the Siege; for Prince Waldeck being apprehensive he was too weak for Humiers in Horse, sent for the States Horse that were before Bonne into Flanders, consisting of 7 Regiments, to which the Elector added 3 Brandenburg ones, commanded by Count Flodorf. Neither was the Detachment he sent to the Camp before Mentz, upon the Request of the Duke of Lorrain, less considerable, though that City, a little while after they were gone, surrendred, and that Detachment re∣turned to the Camp again. However, his Army in the main became considerably lessened herein, so that all he could do was to block up the Town, which yet he did so closely, that
nothing could either get in or go out. In the mean time the Garison made several Sallies, wherein many Men were killed on both sides, and among the rest they made one on the last of Aug. with so much fury upon the Dutch Quarter, that they forced the Vanguard and broke in as far as the Tents, which alarmed the whole Camp: But they met not with the same Success in that which they made the next day upon the Mun∣sterians, for they were beaten back with the loss of near 100 Men slain upon the spot, and 200 wounded. But how strong soever the Garison was at the beginning of the Siege,Bonne be∣sieged. these several Sallies must needs have considera∣bly weakned them, and the News of the taking of Mentz, which was proclaimed in the Elector's Camp by the discharge of all the great Guns, could not be supposed to add any new strength to them. For on the contrary the Governor, when he heard the noise of the Cannon, was so surprized that he sent out to know the reason; of which being well informed, he could hardly believe it at first, so strong was his Imagination that the Town would have held out much longer. But find∣ing it to be true, and the Elector sending him word it was time to Capitulate, he began to make some Overtures, tho' they were so unreasonable, that his Highness would not accept of them; but finding Gen. Sconing now returned to the Camp, he resolved to undertake the Siege vigorously, and not to quit the Place till he had reduced it; which now was rendred so much the more easie by a Reinforcement of 4000 Foot, and 1000 Horse sent him from Mentz, the Duke of Lorrain arriving also in the Camp on the 25th of Sept. Wherefore the Ap∣proaches and Batteries were hastned with all Diligence, and the Trenches at length carried on to the very Foot of the Counterscarp; and the Breaches being made, all things were prepared ready for a general Assault. And they had fallen on, the 5th or 6th of Oct. had it not been for the Rains which fell two Days together: Therefore Sunday the 9th was ap∣pointed for the Work: To this end, the Imperialists were to storm the Horn-Work, while the Hollanders, Brandenburgers and Munsterians attack'd the Counterscarp of the Half-Moon and Covert-Way. In pursuance hereof they all fell on, be∣ing resolved to vanquish, or die in the Attempt, and the Brandenburgers first lodged themselves upon the Counter∣scarp, and drave the Enemy so far, that had the Breach been wide enough for 4 Men abreast, they had entred the City Pell-mell with the French, and taken it by main force. They were harder put to it on the Imperialists side, but after they had been once repulsed, they lodged themselves at last-upon the Horn-work; tho' this Attack was not made without con∣siderable loss. However, the Baron de Hasfield seeing the Out works carried with so much Bravery, and fearing the
Town would be taken by Storm, made it his chief Business to capitulate: In pursuance whereof, Hostages were exchanged; and after divers Disputes and Contests, the Articles were agreed on,Bonne surren∣dred to the Confederates. and ratified the 12th of Oct. at 6 in the Afternoon, whereby all the great Guns, Ammunition and Provision were to remain in his Electoral Highness's disposal, the Hessian In∣tendant, Commissary of War, Treasurer, Commissioner and Receiver of the Contributions, to continue Prisoners of War, and all things that were to be found in Specie, belong∣ing to Mainard Count de Schomberg, to be restored (for you must know they had basely seized upon that gallant Man's Baggage some time before, for the sake of the Plate and the Jewels, of both which there were a considerable quantity) with several other Particulars, too long here to be inserted, and with which we shall conclude the Campaign on the Ger∣man side, and see what has been doing all this while in Hun∣gary, between the Imperialists and Ottomans, since the Affairs of Catalonia can give us no Interruption, there being nothing memorable that passed this Season between the Armies of France and Spain on that side. The Duke of Lorrain,Prince Lewis of Baden made Gene∣ral in Hun∣gary. who had been all along the Emperor's General in Hungary, while well, being recalled to serve this Campaign in the same Quality on the Rhine, of whose Acti∣ons we have already given you the Particulars, his Imperial Majesty could think of no Person so fit to succeed him, as Prince Lewis of Baden, a worthy Choice indeed, and who performed, even in this first Campaign, all, and more than was, or well could be expected from him. About the 10th of June he arrived at Belgrade, where he found only 13000 Germans, but they were followed by a greater Number; and from thence he sent Orders to Picolomini to come and join him with that Body of the Army that was under his Com∣mand, designing to dispute the Passage of the Morave with the Turks, or to give them Battel, if they had pass'd that River already: But finding the Turks were not over-hasty to meet him, and understanding they were so far from any such thing, that they had repass'd the Morave, and were re∣tired towards Nissa, where all their Magazines lay, and where they had strongly entrench'd their Camp, the Prince him∣self pass'd that River over Bridges of Boats with his whole Army, whom he ordered to take Provisions along with them for 3 Weeks, and marched directly towards Nissa, with a Resolution to give the Enemy Battel, as being informed their Army was not above 50000 strong, and that of them there was not above 10000 well disciplined Men. But two pieces of News that he received by the way, caused him to suspend his March; which were, first, That there had fallen such excessive Rains for some time, that had made the Ways
so bad, as it would be impossible for him to march with his Army and Artillery, without endangering the ruining of both: And the other was, That the Turks had made themselves Masters of Zwornich, no strong Place in it self, but was a Post that opened a Way into Sclavonia, into which Country the Turks design'd to fall, as the Commander in the aforesaid Place, who defended it gallantly, and at last surrendred it upon honourable Conditions, informed the Prince; who thereupon sent away to the Count de Cauriani to march forth∣with towards the Save, with all the Force he could draw together, and hinder the Enemy from passing the River. The Prince in the mean time returned with the Army to the Fort they had built near Passarowitz, in order to secure the Bridges they had laid over the Morave: And Aug. 27th the Foot arrived near the Bridge at Grabovez, and the Horse got thither the next day. And tho' the Turks were no sooner informed of these Mo∣tions, and being incouraged, no doubt, by the Retreat of the Christians, but they sent the same Day a Detachment of Horse to fall upon the Foragers, they were valiantly repulsed: At the same time another considerable Detachment of Cavalry was sent towards Semendria, where the Imperial Magazines lay, with a Design to cut off the Prince's March, and hem in his Army on all sides. This being discovered by the Deserters, a Resolution was taken to fall first upon the first Detach∣ment, and then to turn upon the other Part of the Enemy which they had left behind, and which was not above an hour and  March from the Christians. To this effect the Bridge being finished, 500 Men under the command of two Colonels, passed the River, and posted themselves on the other side of the River the same Evening, being followed by 500 more, and in less than 3 hours had sufficiently intrench'd themselves. Next Morning the Dragoons of Stirum and Se∣rau planted themselves upon an Hill very near the Bridge, and 500 Horse possess'd the  between the Army and the Bridge, to secure their March. In the mean time the Infantry,The Battel of Patochin. commanded by Baron Hei∣ster and the Count de Starembergh, marched also to the Bridge, being followed by the Baggage, and encamped in a very ad∣vantageous Post, where they could not well be forced by the Enemy; the Cavalry of oe Left Wing advanced up an Hill, and those of the Right, into a Plain near Rossava. And that the Enemy might think their Design only was to secure the Passage of the Infantry, one part of the Horse were or∣dered to dismount; Whereas, while this was doing, Colonel de St Croix, with some hundreds of Horse, together with the Counts of Chakey, Deak and Buduani, with the Hungarians, Rascians and Hussars getting before the Cavalry, through a
Valley, wherein they could not be discovered, flew with full speed upon the Enemy, and were seconded by the Cavalry, who had opportunity during the Shock, to mount again. The Turks retired slowly, thinking to draw the Christians into a Wood, behind which they had planted 10000 Men: Tho' when they found themselves charged by all the Impe∣rial Cavalry, they fell into some Disorder, and were pursued by the left Wing to a narrow Place, where they made an Halt. But when the Prince of Baden and General Veterani came up with the Regiments of the right Wing, they retreated in Confusion to another Wood, where they were pursued for an Hour and an half, till they came into a Plain. Here it was the Christians drew themselves up in good Order of Battel, and fell upon the rallied Turks with that resolute Bravery, that above 400 of their best Horse were defeated upon the Place, and a great number of Prisoners taken, among whom was the Commander of the Janisaries, together with 12 Co∣ronets, and some Kettle-Drums. The Hungarians and Hus∣sars pursued them a considerable way, killed a great Num∣ber, and got a very large Booty, because the Fliers threw away their Baggage and their Arms, that they might the readier make their Escape. The Cavalry returned the same day to attack the other Party of the Turks, before they could join the Fugitives. To this end, 500 Foot were detach'd to make themselves Masters of a narrow Lanc at the Entrance of a thick Wood, about an Hour and an halfs March long, into which there was but one Way to enter, and beyond it the Enemies Army was encamped in a large Plain. They quick∣ly beat off 3000 Janisaries, and some Horse that lay concea∣led to hinder the Imperialists from gaining it; which, how∣ever, was not done without some loss on both sides. There they stayed till the 30th, where all their Infantry came to encamp in a Plain beyond the Wood, by the Favour of a thick Mist, having a Wood behind them to the Right, ano∣ther Wood that ran out as far as the Morave, and the River it self on the Left. The Prince of Baden who had rejoyn'd the Foot the Evening before, ordered the Horse to re-pass the River, and post themselves in the same place where the Infantry had encamped the Night before, leaving on the other side no more than 7 Squadrons of Hungarians and Ra∣scians, and some Horse and Dragoons a foot, to guard the Baggage. As soon as the Mist cleared up, the Turks appeared drawn up in Battel-array; and the Prince had hardly time enough to range the second Line of his Foot behind the first, before the Turks, both Horse and Foot, advanced upon him, notwithstanding whole Peals of Cannon, and Showers of small Shot poured in upon them. The Conflict lasted about 2 Hours, during which time both sides kept continually firing;
but General Castelli having got out of the Wood with his Dragoons, the Enemy no sooner heard the Trumpets and Kettle-Drums of the first Squadron, but they began to retreat into another Wood, and thereby gave the Imperialists an op∣portunity to plant their Horse behind their Infantry. It fortunately happened at the same time, that a Bavarin, who had been taken at the Siege of Buda, having made his Escape, discovered that there was another Plain behind the Wood, to which the Enemy retreated, where the lay en∣trench'd. Upon this, Count Staremberg having first view'd the Road within the Wood, and finding it broad enough, and withal, that it was not above 500 Paces long, and that the Turks lay in their Entrenchments that were as so many Fortresses for them; the Prince commanded him thither with 300 Men, a Battalion of his own, and one of Starem∣berg's, and was followed by a good body of Infantry. With these he bravely drave the Enemy from their 1st Entrenchment, who thereupon retreated to their second, about 100 Paces further, and environed with a Moat full of Water, that was not accessible on that side. However, they continued firing from one Entrenchment unto another, for above an hour and an half; so that many Soldiers were lost here by the Germans, together with 4 Captains, and a great many men wounded. While this was in agitation, the first Entrench∣ment was levell'd for a Post for the Cavalry; and then Pico∣lomini, who had the Command of the Vanguard that day, advanced both with the Horse and Foot in good Order to the second Entrenchment. Count Palsi in the mean time advanced cross the Woods with his Heydukes, and making an hideous Noise with his Trumpets to terrifie the Enemy, as if there had been some considerable Body that was coming to attack their Rear. This Stratagem took so well, that as soon as they heard the Noise of the Trumpets and Kettle-Drums, and saw Picolomini moving towards them, notwith∣standing all their Vollies of small Shot, they retreated athwart another thick Wood, into their Camp, being pursued by the Imperialists, though the ways were very narrow. But when they came into open ground, Colonel Zand was sent with a Regiment to fall on their Rear, being followed by all the Horse, Regiment by Regiment. Zand with his own Regi∣ment, and that of Serau, drave the Infidels from the Wood, and forced them into their Camp, which was upon an Hill near Patochin, and then staid till other Troops came up with him: But a great Shower falling at that time, and the Night coming on, he fell upon the Enemy, now under great Con∣sternation, with those 2 Regiments only, put them to the Rout, and forced them to quit their Camp, of which the Christians became Masters, and where they sound 105 Pieces
of Cannon, 3 Mortars, several Bombs, a great quantity of Ammunition, Provision, Waggons, Camels, Oxen, Bufalo's, Tents, and other Riches. Some of the Enemy escaped to Jagodin, others to Krakolovez, being pursu'd still by the Hungarians, who kill'd divers of them, and found some Pieces of Cannon, and other Arms, in the Mountains. Though the number of the Slain was not so considerable in these Onsets, yet the Advantage therein, as well as in the great Booty the Imperialists got, was manifestly on their side every way, which will yet farther appear by the succeeding Actions of this Campaign. I am loth to make any interruption in this Place in the rest of the Successes of the Imperial Arms (and the rather, since it has not been my Custom upon other occasions) how∣ever, as I presume it to be pardonable for once, I shall ob∣serve before I proceed any further, That tho' his Imperial Ma∣jesty was without doubt much pleas'd already with his Af∣fairs on this side, yet those towards France seemed mostly at this time to take up the Thoughts of this Court, which was now at Ausburg, whither the Electors and other Princes of the Empire were to come. The outward Appearance of things was such, as if there were nothing but the Coronation of the Empress aud the Election of a King of the Romans in view: But the particular Design was undoubtedly to con∣cert Measures and agree upon what Enterprizes were to be undertaken the following Spring, and to find a way to defray the extraordinary Charges of such a necessary and impor∣tant War, as that wherein they were engaged against France; wherein, how well or ill they succeeded, will best appear by the sequel of this History. But however France might be af∣fected with these Proceedings and Designs (of which she could not be ignorant) she had some sort of satisfaction a∣bout this time to get rid of one turbulent, tho' inconsidera∣ble Enemy, in respect to others, and that was the Algerine, who now made a Peace with her upon these Terms. That all Prizes that were taken on both sides,French make Peace with the Algerines. till the 24th of September (which was the day of the Ratification of the Treaty) should be good; but that all that were taken on ei∣ther side since the Ratification, should be restored. The Al∣gerines engaged themselves to come into the Ocean with for∣ty Sail, to Pyrate upon the English and Dutch, and were to be admitted into all the Ports of France, and especially Brest, and should be further furnished with all things necessary for their Money; but what Vessels they took upon the Ocean were to belong to the French King, tho' the Lading was to
be theirs. And finally, whereas his most Christian Majesty was unwilling they should make any Slaves, they engaged to let him have the Prisoners delivered to him at so much a Head. But, to return from whence I have lately digressed, to the Emperor's Arms in Servia.Baden routs the Tarks near Nissa. The Prince of Baden un∣derstanding the Turks after the fore-mentioned Defeat, were so far from having any further thoughts, or indeed from being in a condition to enter Sclavonia, as before▪ they had intended, that they had quitted the Enterprize of Seback, and not only so, but forsaken Zwornich, after having first plundered and burnt it, because they did not conceive it tenable, and were retired towards Nissa, and being willing to improve the present Consternation of the Enemy, and take the opportunity of the fair Weather, resolved with the Imperial Army, consisting of about 16 or 17000 Men, to ad∣vance towards Nissa, where he happily arrived after several long Marches on the 23d of Sept. and ranged them in order of Battel that very day. The Turkish Army day encamped before the place, from Nissa to the top of the Hill that se∣cured it; he found them intrenched in their Camp much more regularly than the Turks were wont to do, which made it to be believed, that some Christian had been their Director. Besides this, they were invironed with a deep Moat well pal∣lisado'd, and the River that ran through the City, and which was very rapid, secured then on the other side, so that there was no possibility of attacking them any way but behind, where their Camp was only accessible. Nothing passed that day, save some petty Skirmishes between the Volunteers of the Imperial Camp, and some Troops of the Infidels, but the next day the Imperialists decamped an hour before day; the left Wing followed by the Baggage, took their way to the left side of a Mountain, over which they were to march, and where they made an Halt, until the right Wing commanded by the Duke of Croy had joined them; then the whole Army descended into a Valley in Battel-array, at what time the Enemy showed themselves upon another little Hill, over which the Christians were also to pass, before they came in sight of the Infidel's Camp, making a shew as if they intend∣ed to come down, and to charge the Imperialists, who no sooner perceived them, than that they boldly advanced to meet them. But the Turks not thinking it convenient to tarry, the Christians advanced to the top of the Hill, without any opposition, where they found themselves near the Ene∣my's Intrenchments, and perceived it was impossible to force them on that side, with an Army not half so numerous as the Enemy. Whereupon it was concluded they should seek
out a more accessible place, and to that purpose they march∣ed along a Valley, coasting the Enemy that lay on the right side, with a design to fall upon them in the Rear: But be∣cause they were not well acquainted with the Ways, Count Cziaki was sent out with a Party of Hussars to view the Ave∣nues on that side. In the mean time several slight Skirmishes passed betvveen Parties of both Armies, which however did not hinder the Imperialists from keeping on their Way, ex∣pecting Count Cziaki, who returned at length, and assured them they might march on without any danger; the which was also confirmed by a Prisoner taken at the same time, who added withal, that behind the Hills, which the Army had in view before it, there were two Villages upon the left, and to the right a spacious Plain, large enough to embattle the Army, and where they might attack the Enemy's Rear. When the Turks perceived the Christians Designs, they be∣gan to intrench that part of the Camp which they had neg∣lected before, not dreaming of being attack'd that way; The Flower of the Janizaries were ordered to guard the Hills, which they saw the right Wing of the Christians going to possess themselves of, and sent out 4000 Horse, to charge the Rear of the left Wing, commanded by Picolomini, who sending out a Detachment of 3 Squadrons of Noirkermer's Regiment, they charged the Enemy so briskly that they were repulsed, and pursued above 300 Paces. In the mean time the right Wing was engaged with the Janizaries, who made a stout resistance, and cost the life of the brave Major-General Vellon; but the Christians rather ani∣mated than born down with the resistance they met with, redoubled their Fury, and after they had beaten off the Ja∣nizaries, gained the Hill, whither they brought their Can∣non, and played briskly upon the Enemy, who were retired into a bottom, from whence they also fired continually upon the Christians. And now the Spahi's, who had been beaten by a Detachment of the left Wing, returned again to the Charge, endeavouring still all they could to flank the Chri∣stians, and fell on with much greater Fury than before, as if the Ignominy of their flight had given life anew to their Cou∣rage. This on-set was firmly sustained by Pali's Regi∣ment of Heydukes, who being seconded by others, put the whole Ottoman Cavalry into disorder, and drove them even upon the Janizaries; who seeing the Cowardize of the Spa∣hi's, fired upon them; which being done also by the Turks posted on the other side of the River, this manner of Treat∣ment forced the Fugitives to renew the Charge.
But alas; that served only to augment the Confusion that was already very great in the Ottoman Army: For the Chri∣stians taking advantage of the disorders, flew upon the Ene∣my from all parts, who then betook themselves to their Heels, not knowing whither to fly; So that only Night pro∣tected them from the fury of the Victors. But several of them in seeking to save their Lives in the Dark, not being able, because of that, to find the way to the Bridge, adven∣tured, in hopes to pass the River, to escape by swimming; but the stream was so rapid that most of them were drown∣ed, insomuch that of all the Turkish Cavalry, there were but very few that escaped: In their Camp the Imperialists found great store of Utensils for Pioneers, 30 Pieces of Cannon of an extraordinary bigness, of which some were four square, a great Number of Carcasses, Glass Granadoes, Bisquet, Bar∣ley, Rice, Meal, Oats, Tobacco, Camels, and other things; but of all the Plunder the Prince of Baden reserved only for himself the Serasquier's Tent, which was very magnificent, and which had been sent him by the Grand-visier, in regard he had lost his own in the former Battel. After the Army had pil∣laged the Camp they entred Nissa, without opposition, where they found Provisions enough for the Subsistence of the whole Army for 5 or 6 Weeks,Nissa taken by the Im∣perialists. and took above 3000 Horses and Mules; and what still made this Victory the more considera∣ble, was the smallness of the Imperialists loss, there being not above 300 killed, and not many more wounded, where∣as the Turks were computed to have been worse for this Battle by 8000 Men. The Prince still to pursue this great advantage dispatcht away the very next day 3000 Horse, under the Command of Picolomini, to look after the fugitive Turks, with orders to advance as far as Sophia, and view the Country, who returned the 13th of Sept. without having been able to meet with any of the Enemy, but reported the Countrey was ve∣ry good, having suffered but little by the War; that he had put Garrisons into Pio and Mussa Pafora, which the Turks had quitted upon his Approach; and that he understood by some Prisoners he had taken, that the Infidels were retired to Sophia, where they endeavoured to rally their broken Troops. This Intelligence moved the Prince to fortifie Nissa, and so much the rather, because the Country People, who came in great Numbers to implore his Protection, assured him, that the Country was good and ertile, and if preserved, sufficient to furnish an Army with all necessary Provisions; and when he had done, he made Count Pic lomini Comman∣der of the Place, and the adjacent Country depending on it; and soon after Cout Tekeley, who had some time before pos∣sessed himself of Orswa, thought convenient to quit it, but
he first set the Town on fire, and then retired to Silistria. Mean while the Prince of Baden, not willing to conclude this glorious Campaign with this last Action, set forward Oct. 6th with his Army for Widin, another important Place, with a good Castle upon the Danube; and upon the 11th arrived at Breslau, where he staid one Day in expectation of the Baggage, and from thence sent a Detachment of Germans and Hungarians to view the Country, and to get some intelli∣gence of the Enemy. These returned next Day with some Prisoners, and reported that the two Bassa's were retired near Widin, with their Forces, and that Tekeley had taken the Road to Sophia. Hereupon the Prince re-sumed his March, and on the 14th by 10 in the Morning got to the Plains of Widin, when the Enemy, who knew nothing of the Army's March, were strangely surprized to see the Imperial Foragers foraging very near their Camp; and their Consternation was so great, that before they could recover themselves, the Prince his right Wing had passed the great stone Bridges that were built upon the Moras, and was drawn up in Battle-array, expecting the coming up of the left Wing, which passed immediately after. Neither did the Enemy endeavour to hinder them, which gave the right Wing, an opportunity to take up their Posts very near the City, and to secure themselves with the Danube. The Turks seemed at first very couragious, but they were charged with so much bravery by the right Wing, where the Prince of Baden was in Person, that they were dri∣ven to an Intrenchment they had made about the Town, upon whom however the Imperial Cavalry advanced, recei∣ving the Fire of the Janizaries, which killed some Horse-men, and made the rest recoil: Yet they presently rallied again behind a rising Ground, and advanced within 40 Paces of the Enemy's Moats, where they stood their Ground, till the rest of the right Wing had planted themselves near a Church∣yard that was there. In the mean time General Veterani who commanded the left Wing, ordered 200 Dragoons to alight, and attack the Enem's Intrenchments, which they did so well, that they entred in a short time the City pell-mell, and were soon se∣conded by the Cavalry, and the rest of the Forces, killing in the whole of this Action near 2000 Turks, with the loss of 400 of their own Men. Those of the Turks that could not save themselves on the Barks that lay upon the Danube, or with that part of the Cavalry that fled to Sophia, retired to the Castle of Widin,Widin sur∣rendred to the Imperi∣aits. where they resolved to hold out a for∣mal Siege, which made the Prince send to Semendria for his great Cannon. In the mean time he ordered his Men to begin to open the Trenches, that all might be ready upon their Arrival, for widening a Breach, and storming the Place: But
the besieged upon better Thoughts would not stay for the Cannon, and therefore upon the 18th of Oct. they capitulated, to march out of the Place with Arms and Baggage, and were conducted by Water to Nicopolis, with which the Prince of Baden concluded this long and most glorious Campaign, distributing his Army into Winter-quarters in Transilvania, and Vallachia, sore against the Will of the Hospodar who could not help it,The Turkish Embassadors press for a Peace. and then he returned to Vienna. But while these things were transacted in the Field, the Ottoman Embassadors at Vienna, for some part of the time, pressed very much the Negotiations of Peace, wherein they found the Emperour but little disposed: Yet having at length received some dis∣patches from the Grand-Seignior, they themselves grew much more remiss in their instances; The reason whereof the Em∣perour and his Allies could not well penetrate into: And therefore to sound them the more, it was thought fit the Pretensions of the Allies should have been imparted to them, to see whether they had any orders to conclude upon those Con∣ditions, which Proposals were: 1. That the Kingdom of Hun∣garry, should be restored with all its Dependances, and the Principality of Bosnia, in such a manner, that the Grand-Seignior should never more claim any right therein. 2. That Moldavia, Walachia, and the Republick of Ragusa, which had put themselves under the Emperor's Protection, should be comprized in the Treaty of Peace, and not to be disturb∣ed by the Turks in any manner whatsoever. 3. That all the Tartars should depart the Countries. 4. That the Port should pay 6000000 towards the Expences of the War, im∣mediately after the Conclusion of the Peace, and 2000000 every Year for free Passage to Constantinople. 5. That all the Christians that had been taken during the War, which were above 1000000 should be set at liberty; lastly, that Tekeley, and all his Adherents should be delivered up to the Emperor. The King of Poland demanded the restitution of Caminiec, and 4000000 in Silver. And for the Venetians, they required, 1. The restitution of all the Islands that formerly belonged to them, and particularly the Island of Negrpont. 2. The restitution of the Dukedom of Athens. 3. The Ex∣change of Lepanto for Tragusa. 4. The restitution of Dulig∣no and Mahona. 5. A Regulation of the Limits of the con∣quered Cities, and Countries: And lastly, that the Grand-Seignior should pay to the Republick 400000 Ducats. But these Propositions seemed so unreasonable to the Em∣bassadors, that they tore their Beards upon it; However, they delivered a Letter to the Imperial Commissioners, which the Grand-Seignior had written to the Emperour; Within which, it was thought some Offers and Proposals tending to a Peace might be met with. But they were sur∣prized
to find nothing but Complements, and the Imperial Court was so incensed at it, that they sent Orders for the Ot∣toman Embassadors to be gone; but while they were prepar∣ing for their departure, word was sent them that they might stay, till the Return of the Couriers from Poland and Venice, to know the final Resolutions of those two Republicks. At last depart they did, but stopped at Commorra, and after a long stay there, got leave at length to return, leaving the Peace that way desperate, and the War to be prosecuted with as great fury as ever. But how high soever the Demands of the Venetians were in their Proposals of Peace, they must have proceeded from another Motive, whatever it were, than the Operations of this Compagne, which proved very unsuccessful to them, as the last had done;Napoli di Malvasia blockaded b the Ve∣netians. For the Siege of Napoli di Malvasia, a Ci∣ty in the Morea, which their Forces undertook, did not go forward with that Success that was desired, their Army be∣ing only worn out before it, and a great Number of brave Officers lost; And therefore being reduced to this bad plight, and the Garrison obstinately refusing to hearken to a Sur∣render, tho' the Place was very much ruined by the Bombs, they resolved at length to change the Siege into a Blockade. To this end, they put 2000 Men in Garrison into the two Forts, which they had raised on the Land-side, and left some Frigates at Sea to endeavour the prevention of any Relief that way: Which being effected, they drew off the rest of the Army to Napoli di Romania, to take up their Winter-Quarters. Neither did their Affairs in Dalmatia meet with any better Success than those in the Morea. For Seignior Mc∣lino, Proveditor-General of that Countrey, having advanced towards Narenta, to make himself Master of la Gabella, and some other Posts, met the Turkish Horse near the Bridge that leads to that Place; The Vanguard, composed of Morlaques, was charged so vigorously, that they were forced to give Ground. However, Molino stood firm with 600 Horse and his Infantry; but finding the Turks were reinforced, he was not willing to engage in a Fight, the Success whereof was so much the more doubtful, by how much his Men had been somewhat discouraged by the Defeat of the Morlaques; where∣fore he retreated in good Order, and with the Loss of no great number of Soldiers. The rest of Italy was hitherto pretty quiet,The Vu∣dois prse∣cution at an end. save for the Troubles of the poor Vaudois, whose Persecution is now at an end, and with which doth a Cloud gather, that in a little time shall overcast a great part of this Countrey. But of this we shall have occasion to speak in the succeeding Years, and take notice here; that this, as it hath been remarkable upon many other Accounts, so upon that of the Death of one of
the greatest Popes that lived since Gregory the Great's Days, the famous and renowned Odeschalchi by Name, and Innocen XI. upon his Assumpsion of the Papacy,The death of Innocent XI. who departed this Life upon the 12th of Aug. between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon. He was born at Como in Italy, in the State of Milan, was made Clerk of the Chamber under the Pontificate of Vrban VIII. and of Innocent X. by whom he was made a Cardinal in 1645. after which he was preferred to be Legate of Bologna, and Bishop of Novarra; and Clement X. dying the 22d of July, 1676. he was advanced to the Pontifical Chair the 22d of Sept. following. Some have called him the Protestant Pope, for what Reason, I know not, unless it be, that when France was exercising her Severities upon her Reformed Subjects, they were highly opposed by him at the same time upon ano∣ther Account; and that some said, that he in one of his Let∣ters exprest a Dislike, not only at the one, but the other of their Proceedings, at least-wise as to the manner of it: But be it as it will, he was certainly a very great Man (for all the Satyrs that were made upon him in France) and it cannot be taken ill by the Publick, if, with a judicious Person, I encoun∣ter all their Calumnies with what an Impartial Author wrote of him when he was yet but a Cardinal, saying, Odeschalchi is most certainly a very great Man, and a Person of Worth and In∣tegrity, not to be corrupted, Exemplary, Charitable, Disinterested, Disingaged from the World, without Pride, without Vanity, with∣out Pomp, Zealous with Moderation, Austere only to himself. His Kindred are Persons of Worth; his Brother died at Como some Years since, Canonized by the People for his signal Works of Piety and Charity; there is nothing to be blamed in his Conduct, and of all the Colledge he is the most fit to be Pope for his Honesty and Vertue. But whether the vacant See was supplied with a Person wor∣thy to succeed so great a Man, may appear hereafter; we shall only here note, That Peter Ottoboni, a Venetian by Birth, and Bishop of Porro, was on the 6th of Oct. following, promoted to the Papal Dignity, being aged 80 Years, within a few Months. The Affairs abroad being terminated, as we have above related, for the Year, 1689. we shall enter upon this with the Affairs of Britain.Laws made agaist Po∣pish Succes∣ors, and other Pro∣ceedings of the Parlia∣mentsf. The Parliament of England happily ended their most important Affairs towards the beginning of it; and in regard they had found the Aim and Drift of the preceding Reigns, to have been absolutely to annihilate the Authority of Parliaments; and that King James in particular had gone a great way towards the introducing the Popish Re∣ligion into the Nation, they took especial care to prevent the like for the future, by Enacting, in concurrence with the Roy∣al Authority, That the Kings and Queens of England, should
be obliged at their coming to the Crown to take the Test in the first Parliament that should be called at the beginning of their Reign; and in the Bill of Succession added a Clause, That if any King or Queen of England should embrace the Roman Catholick Religion, or Marry with a Roman Catho∣lick Prince or Princess, their Subjects should be absolved from their Oaths of Allegiance. They also annull'd the pretended Parliament in Ireland, and also ordained, That all those who should take up Arms against the King, after the 24th of Feb. or should hold Correspondence with his Enemies, should be guilty of high Treason; And granted the King 2 Shillings in the Pound upon Land, with the necessary Clauses and Re∣strictions; and appropriated Part of the Mony for Payment of the Seamen, and setting out the Fleet. After this, being prorogued to the 12th of Apr. they were by Proclamation dissolved upon the 6th of Febr. and the King by the same Pro∣clamation called a Parliament to meet on the 30th of March, to whom he delivered himself to this Effect: That being resolved to omit nothing on his Part, that might contribute to the Peace and Prosperity of the Nation; and to that end, believing his Presence absolutely necessary in Ireland, for the Reducing of that Kingdom, he had called them together, to desire their Assistance, that he might be in a Capacity to carry on the War there with Speed and Vigour. To which purpose he desired them to hasten the settling of the Revenues of the Crown, and that he might have a Fund in the mean time settled, upon the Cre∣dit whereof, he might raise Mony for the present Exigences of the Nation. Then he recommended to them the passing of an Act of Oblivion, such as he had ordered to be drawn up for the preventing the loss of time usually spent in Deliberations of that kind, and where∣in but few were excepted, that his Subjects might see he had no other Intentions, but such as were conformable to the Laws of the Land, and to leave those without Excuse, that should go about to disturb the Government in his Absence. And lastly, recommend∣ed to them the Vnion with Scotland; and then informed them, That he intended, during his Absence, to leave the Administra∣tion of the Government in the Hands of the Queen, and desired them to prepare an Act to that Purpose; concluding with an ear∣nest Desire, that they would be as speedy in the Dispatch of Bu∣siness as possibly they could, in regard his Expedition into Ireland would not admit of any long Session. The Parliament went roundly to work upon this Speech of the King's, yet so that it took up some time before they could bring all their Matters to bear; But at length the Act of Oblivion, after many Difficulties removed, and so long desired by the King, was approved and past; so was another for putting the Administration of the Government into the
Queen's Hands, not only during the King's Absence in Ireland, but when-ever his Affairs should call him out of the Kingdom. They also found out Ways to raise the Subsidies that were granted, settled the Revenues, and divers Persons did in the mean time, advance Money for the King's present Occa∣sions; and that nothing might happen to the Prejudice of the Government, while the King was absent, the Deputy-Lieu∣tenants of the Counties were authorized to raise the Militia in case of necessity, and all Roman Catholicks ordered to re∣pair to their places of Abode, and not to stir above 5 Miles from thence, without leave; and all that held any Imploy∣ment in the State, tho' never so inconsiderable, to swear Fi∣delity to the King and Queen. Thus Matters being brought to a good Conclusion, his Majesty, after returning them his Thanks, Prorogued them to the 17th of June, and then hasted for Ireland, where he arrived on the 14th of the same Month, and where at present we shall leave him, and see what was doing nearer home. The Rebels in Scotland,The Affairs of Scotland. under the Command of Colonel Cannon, tho' not otherwise considerable for their Strength, then by the unaccessible Places they possess'd in the High∣lands, yet continued still in a Body, and took their Oppor∣tunity to make frequent Incursions into the Low-lands to plunder and spoil, more like a Company of Banditti, than Regular Troops; over whom the Government there, how∣ever, kept a vigilant Eye, and detected some Correspondence held between them and other Persons in Edenburg and else∣where, who before pretended to be Friends, but it ended in the close Confinement of them; Yet notwithstanding all this, they could not prevent them from receiving some Succour from without. For King James, notwithstanding the Delay of the French Succours which did not arrive in Ireland before the 4th of March, yet built so very much upon them, that tho' he had neither Ammunition nor Provision to spare, he caused in the mean time two Frigats to be rigged up at Dub∣lin, laden with Cloaths, Arms and Ammunition, and sent them away to his Friends in Scotland, having besides on Board them, Colonel Buchan, Colonel Wauhup, and about 40 Com∣mission-Officers more, who had all the good Luck to get safe into the Isle of Mull. With this Reinforcement they were so incouraged, that sometime after that, they adventured, to the number of 1500, to march as far as Strathspag, in the County of Murray, which Sir Thomas Levingstone no sooner understood, and being unwilling to give them any Opportu∣nity for a farther Accession of Strength, in being joyned with other Malecontents, but he took along with him 800 Foot, 6 Troops of Dragoons, and 2 Troops of Horse, and fell up∣on them so suddenly, that the Horse and Dragoons entring
their Camp, put them into such an immediate Confusion, that they betook themselves to flight, leaving between 4 and 500 of their Number slain upon the Spot, an 100 taken Pri∣soners, and among them 4 Captains, 3 Lieutenants, and 2 En∣signs; nor had any of them escaped, had not a thick Mist fell in the height of the Execution. This was no sooner done, but Sir Thomas advanced to the Castle of Lethirgdey, comman∣ded by Colonel Buchan's Nephew, and having lodged a Mine under it, quickly brought the Garrison to surrender at Dis∣cretion. Neither was Major Ferguson less successful in the Isle of Mull, where he landed and destroy'd several Places be∣longing to the Enemy, forcing them to desert the Castle of Dewart, and betake themselves to the Hills. Nor yet was the Blow given them by the Scotch Parliament of less Impor∣tance, for besides their Passing an Act to restore the Presby∣terian Ministers that were thrust from their Churches since the 1st of Jan. 1661. they made another, declaring all those Rebels that were actually in Arms against the King and Queen. But notwithstanding the ill Success of the Jacobites in Scot∣land,The Jaco∣bites Plot. the whole Party would not seem thereby to be discou∣raged, especially those in England, who thought it a very op∣portune Season, while the King was absent, to attempt some∣thing considerable to the Advantage of their Cause; And therefore having timely concerted Matters with their Friends on the other side of the Water, it was so agreed, That while part of the French Fleet should bear up into the Thames, to favour and assist the Designs of those that were in London, who were very numerous by the flocking of a great many of the Conspirators from all Parts of the Country thither, they were to have made an Insurrection in several Places at once. Certain Persons were to have taken upon them the Ad∣ministration of Affairs, till the Return of King James, who was to leave the Command of his Army to his Generals, and hasten with all Speed into England. The other part of the French Fleet having joyned their Gallies, was to have land∣ed 8000 Men at Torbay, with Arms for a greater Number; after which the Gallies and Men of War were to Sail into the Irish Sea, to hinder the Return of King William and his For∣ces. Their Party in Scotland was to have revolted at the same time in several Parts of that Kingdom. But however, the Matter was in reality, the whole Contrivance seems to have been founded upon a Presumption, if not Assurance of the English Fleet, being first beaten by the French; of which whether they had any foresight otherwise than from the ine∣quality of the Strength, which was considerably at this time to the Advantage of France, I am not able to unriddle. Yet, the Conspiracy by the timous Discovery of it, proved
a vain Contrivance, tho' the Grounds upon which the For∣mation thereof seemed to depend, proved but too success∣ful. For all the French Fleet having entred the Channel, as be∣fore concerted, they veered some time upon the English Coast, as expecting the Effect of the Conspiracy, which was to have broken out the 18th of June; of which the Queen had no sooner notice, but she sent the Earl of Torrington, who was Admiral, Orders to fight the Enemy what-ever befel him, as knowing they could have no good Design by coming so near us. But how dishonourable soever this Action seem∣ed to be to the English Nation, yet there was one Circum∣stance that attended it, that was somewhat favourable; For the People generally were possess'd with an Opinion of the English Seamens Courage and Bravery, above those of the French; and many with so high a Conceit of the Admiral that Commanded them, that it was some days before they could be brought to be perswaded of the Truth of what had happened; And their Concern about it, even then, was much alleviated by the good News we had of his Majesty's Success in Ireland, at the Battle at the Boyne, which was fought the day after, and of which by and by. But we must first return where we left off in Ireland, and that was to the Army going from Dundalk into their Winter Quarters, and take a short View of the State of things there till the King's Arrival. Dundalk- Camp was not the only the Place that proved fatal to our Army in Ireland,The Iris Affairs. for they died in great numbers, both Officers and Souldiers, after they got into Quarters; and among the former Colonel Langston departed this Life of a Fever at Lisburn, and my Lord Hewet, and the Lord Ros∣common, of the same Distemper at Chester: So that about the beginning of the new Year several Regiments were broke into others, and the Officers continued at half Pay, till Provision could be made for them in other Regiments, whilst others went over into England for Recruits. However, Sickness by degrees abating, about the beginning of Febr. they found both Men and Horses, such as survived, in pretty good Heart; when the General, being informed that the Ene∣my were drawing down some Forces towards Dundalk, and that they had laid in great Store of Corn, Hay and other Provisions, with a Design from thence to disturb our Fron∣tier Garrisons, sent a considerable Body of Horse and Foot that way, himself following them on the 11th towards Drum∣more, in order to wait the Enemies Motion; But the Irish de∣signs at this time lay another way: For while the Duke was upon this Expedition, there was Notice given Colonel Wool∣sey, that they had a Design to fall upon Belturbet, which he
had taken from them a little before; and that to that end a con∣siderable number of them were advanced to Cavan, and more to follow; who thereupon marched diligently from Belturbet with 700 Foot and 300 Horse and Dragoons in the Evening towards them, as thinking to surprize them next Morning ealry, they being not above 8 Miles off: But he met with so many Difficulties in his March, that instead of being be∣fore day light at the Place he designed, it was not only half an hour after break of day before he came in sight of it, but also the Enemy had got notice of his coming: So that in∣stead of surprizing them, he might well have been surprized himself. For the first thing he saw, was a Body of the Ene∣my drawn up in good Order, and might consist of about 4000 Men; but there being no retreating now either with Honour or Safety, the Colonel was resolved to stand stoutly to it;Col. Wool∣sey routs the Irish. and therefore having first told his Men the Advanta∣ges of being brave, and the inevitable Ruin of the whole Party, if they proved otherwise; and thereupon finding them very compliant to his Desire, he sent a Party of Iniskilling Dragoons towards the Enemy, who were presently charged by a great Body of their Horse, and beat back past the Front of their own Foot, who were so enraged at them, that some of Major General Kirk's Men, and Colonel Wharton's fired up∣on them, and killed 7 or 8 of the number; but some of the Enemies Horse pursued them so far, that many of them were killed by our Foot as they endeavoured to get off. By this time the Body of the Party was advanced near the Irish, who were posted upon the top of a rising Ground, not far from the Town; and who, as our Men advanced up the Hill, fired a whole Volley upon them, and then set up an Huzza, but scarce killed a Man, their Shot flying over them. Our Men however went on till they came within Pistol-shot, and then fired, which so galled the Irish, that they imme∣diately retired towards the Town, and entred into a Fort they had there, and from whence they sallied and made a very fierce Attack upon the English, who had too speedily fallen to Plunder. But Woolsley having 250 Foot, and about 80 Horse for a Reserve, the Enemy were beat off again, their Horse flying quite beyond the Town, and the Foot retiring to the Fort again. The Soldiers got good store of Shoes and other things in the Place, but their Ammunition was blown up, and their Provisions destroy'd; for the Colonel was forced to set the Town on fire, to get his Men out in the time of the Sally, as not knowing what might happen: The Enemy's Loss in that Action was considerable, and so much the more advantageous to the English; in that it broke the Neck of a Design the Irish had of drawing together a Body
of 10000 Men at Cavan, to fall upon Belturbet, and other Pla∣ces, and gave Colonel Woolsley about the beginning of Apr. an opportunity to take the Castle of Killishandra, with whose Services the General was very well pleased; who upon that sent him a Battalion of Danes, that were lately landed in Ireland, to reinforce him at Belturbet. About the same time Sir John Lanier, with a Party of a 1000 Horse, Foot, and Dragoons, made an Attempt upon Dundalk, took Bedloe- Ca∣stle, and the Ensign that Commanded there, and brought from beyond the Town and about it, about 1500 Cows and Oxen. The Ensign was carried to Lisburn, and brought be∣fore the General into his Garden, where he commonly used to walk before Dinner; who before he asked him any Que∣stions, gave him a pretty Caution to be sincere in his An∣swers; saying, You have a Commission, and for that Reason, if not otherwise, you are a Gentleman; This obliges you to speak Truth, which if you do not, I can know it by examining other Prisoners, and then I shall have no good Opinion of you. But for all this, and what-ever else he told him afterward in pri∣vate, he could get little or nothing out of him that was Ma∣terial. But King James did not seem to be so sensibly concerned at these Disadvantages, so remote from him in the North, as he was at the loss of the only Man of War, I think, he had in his Possession; and of which, though in it self no such considerable Action, as might merit a room in this Treatise; Yet there are some Circumstances belonging to it that are engaging enough, and will not permit me to pass it over in silence. Sir Clovesly Shovell being about the 12th of Apr. ar∣rived at Belfast, as Convoy to divers Ships, that carried over Necessaries for the Army, and there having Intelligence of a Frigat that lay at Anchor in the Bay of Dublin, he set sail on the 18th, being Good-Friday, to the Mouth of the said Bay; And there leaving the Monk, and some other great Ships, he took the Monmouth-Yatch, and one or two more, with several long Boats, and went up to Polley, where the Frigat lay, being one half of the Scotch Fleet, that was taken in the Channel the preceding Year, carrying 16 Guns, and 4 Pattereroes: King James when he was advertised of it, said, It was some of his Loyal Subjects of England, that were re∣turning to their Duty and Allegiance. But he was quickly con∣vinced of his Mistake, when he saw them draw near the Ship, and heard the firing; and therefore he rid out towards Rings-End, where a vast croud of People of all sorts gather∣ed together, and several Regiments were drawn out, to kill, if it were possible, those bold Fellows at Sea, who durst up∣on such a good day perform so wicked a Deed, as they phrased it. Captain Bennet who Commanded the Frigat run her a
ground, and after several firings, when they saw a Fire-ship coming in, which Sir Clouvesly had given the signal for; the Men who were about 40, of which they lost 6 or 7 in the Acti∣on, quitted her, and our Men took her; but in her going off one of her Hoys run aground and was dry, when the Tide was gone out, tho' the rest of the Boats were not a far off being full of armed Men; and a Frenchman of K. James his Guards coming nigh the Boats to fire his Pistols in a bravado, had his Horse shot under him, and was forced to fling away his Jack-boots, to run away in his Stockings to save himself, leaving his Saddle and Accouterments to some of the English Seamen, who would go ashoar to fetch them off: King James went back much concerned at the Adventure, and 'twas re∣ported he should say, That all the Protestants in Ireland were of Cromwell's breed, and deserved to have their Throats cut, which if true, argued no great Stock of Discretion in him, however all the Protestants that walked that way during the Action, were secured in Prison, and only two of them made their Escape to the English Boats. But to return again to the Affairs of the North,Charlemont Castl block∣ed up. there was but little more of any moment done there before the King's Arrival, besides the taking of the Castle of Charlemont, a trong place, both by Nature and Art, as being seated upon a piece of Ground in the middle of a Bay, and only accessible by two ways, which the Irish had partly broke down; but what was designed by the Irish for its relief and security, pro∣ved the loss of it. For Mack-Mahon with a Detachment of between 4 and 500 Men, having in the Night got over the Bogs, into the Place, with Ammunition, and some small Quan∣tities of Provision, Monsieur Davesant, Cambon's Lieutenant Collonel having notice of it, and that they designed to return in a small time, divided his Men into 3 parts: When the 3d Night after their going in, they were marching out again, near to Captain la Carry's Post, who had 40 Men with him, He let their Van pass him, and then fired upon their main Body, killing 8 of them with an Officer, and forcing the rest into Charlemont, who for hast left 110 Muskets, 6 Halbards, some Drumms, and several other things behind them, the same ill success they met with in the other Attempts then made: But when the Blockade was re-inforced from the Ge∣neral, who, some said, knew of Mack-Mahou's going in, and ordered them to suffer him to pass, that their stay might bring the Garrison the sooner low, and so be forced to sur∣render; The Irish made no further Attempt to escape, but it had almost been as well for them to have fallen into the Hands of the English, as to be beat back as they were, For old Teague O Regan, the Governour, was so angry with them for it, that he swore, If they could not get out, they should have
no entertainment nor lodging within; And he was as good as his Word, for they were forced to make little Huts in the dry Ditch within the Palisadoes, and upon the Counterscarp, few or none of them being permitted to go within the Gates of the Castle; so that between the one and the other, the poor Fellows were in a miserable plight. The General being resolved to possess himself of the Place, sent several Regiments that way, who encamped almost round it, having some time before sent old Teague a summons to sur∣render; but he was then very surly, and bid the Messenger tell his Master from old Teague O Regan, That he was an old Knave, and by St. Patrick, he should not have the Town at all; At which Answer, the Duke only smiled, saying, He would give Teague greater reasons to be angry in a short time, and so indeed it proved: For our Forces now lying so near them, and two Detachments being kept there against their Wills, made every thing so very scarce, that they were reduced to great straits; And no hopes of relief appearing, the Gover∣nour upon the 12th of May, having leave from the Officer, commanding without,Charlemont surrendred. and a Guard for them, sent a Lieute∣nant Collonel, and a Captain, with Terms of Surrender to the Duke, which with some Alterations were agreed to: For the Duke had an Account that the Place was very strong, and therefore he chose rather to give them Terms, than to spend much time about it, since there were greater matters in agi∣tation. The Articles were no sooner signed, and a Truce published, but the General sent Robert Alloway, Esq, Com∣missary of the Train, to take an account of the Stores in the Garrison, which marched out at the time appointed, and then drew up before the Gate. 4 Companies of Collonel Babing∣ton's marched in, and most of the English Regiments therea∣bouts were drawn up, (as the Irish march'd along towards Armagh) and being all well clothed and armed, it made the Irish a little out of Countenance to see it, who were otherwise, which made the Collonel of the Brandenburg Regiment seem very much concerned, that he should go to Fight against such Scoundrels, as the Irish seemed to be. The General himself went that Morning from Legacory to see the Castle of Charlemont; and after the Irish had march'd about half a Mile from it, they drew up in 2 Battalions, about 400 Men in each, and there stood till the General came to see them. Old Teague was mounted upon an old ston'd Horse, and he very lame with the Scratches, Spavin, Ring-bones, and other Infirmities; but withal so vitious, that he would fall a kicking, and squeeling, if any Body came near him. Teague himself had a great Bunch upon his Back, a plain red Coat, an old weather-beaten Wig hanging down at full length, a little narrow white Beaver cocked up, a yellow
Cravat-string, but all of one side, his Boots with 1000 Wrin∣les in them; and though it was a very hot Day, yet he had a great Muff hanging before him, and to Crown all, was al∣most tipsie with Brandy. Thus mounted and equipp'd, he drew near the Duke with a Complement, but his Horse would not allow him to make it a long one, for he fell to work pre∣ently, and the Duke had scarce time to make him a civil re∣turn, but smiled afterwards, and said: Teague's Horse was ve∣ry mad, and himself very drunk. The General then view'd the Irish, Battalions, who all, both Officers and Soldiers, after they had made him a great many Legs, stared upon him as if they knew not whether he was a Man, or some other strange Creature; For the Irish were generally wont to ask one ano∣ther, What is that sham-bear that all this talk is of? The Duke seeing so many Women and Children among them, ask'd the reason of keeping such a Number in the Garrison, which no doubt, destroy'd their Provisions; He was answered, that the Irish were naturally very hospitable, and that they all fared alike: But the greatest reason was, the Soldiers would not stay in the Garrison without their Wives and Mistresses; The Duke reply'd there was more Love than Policy in it, and in a little while return'd to the Castle; Where my Author says, himself saw in Teague's own Room, several Papers, and among the rest, a Copy of a Letter writ formerly by some Persons about King James, giving an Account of the State of the Garrison, and withall a very true relation of the English proceedings in several things; which was an Argument, they did not want intelligence. Among others there were two Priests in the Garrison, and there happened a very pleasant Adventure between one of them, and a Dragoon of Collonel Heaford's Regiment, as they were guarding the Irish towards Armagh: For falling into Discourse about Religion, at last they fixed upon a Topick, and what should it be but Tran∣substantiation. The Dragoon being a pleasant, witty Fellow, drolled upon the Priest, and put him so to it, that he had little to say for himself; upon which he grew so angry, that he struck the Dragoon, who being not used tamely to sub∣mit to Blows, it came to a Combat, and he thrash'd his Fa∣therhood very severely: Upon this, complaint being made to Teague, as he sat at Dinner with the English Officers at Armagh; all that he said was, That he was very glad on't, What the Deel had he to do to dispute Religion with a Dragoon? Thus matters stood in Ireland when the King went over,K. William landed in Ireland. who landed as you have been told before, at Carrigfergus, on the 14th of June, being attended by Prince George, the Duke of Ormond, Ears of Oxford, Scarborough and Manchester, the honourable Mr. Boyl, and many other Persons of Quality, and went in Duke Schomberg's Coach to Belfast that Evening;
and next Day being Sunday, Dr. Royce preached before him, on Heb. 6. 11. Through Faith they subdued Kingdoms, and some days after he went to Lisburn, and dined with the General. The King from thence passed to Hilsburough; where he set out an Order on the 20th, forbidding the pressing of Horses from the Country People; But finding things did not go on so fast as he desired, he exprest some dissatisfaction, saying; He did not come there to let Grass grow under his Feet, and he made his words good; For the whole Army now received Or∣ders to march into the Field, and encamped at a Place called Loughbritland, where the King arrived on the 22d; having gi∣ven Orders before his coming, for removing the Camp from the S. side to the N. W. of the Town, that he might take a view of the Regiments as they march'd; and though the Weather was very dry and windy, and the Dust exceeding troublesome; Yet the King was no sooner come up, but he was within the Throng of them, and afterwards view'd every Regiment very Critically, which pleased the Soldiers migh∣tily, and every one was ready to give all possible Demonstra∣tion of their Courage and Duty. From hence they march'd to Newry, and on the 27th to Dundalk, where the whole Ar∣my, English, Dutch, Danes, Germans and French joyned, making in all 36000 Men, as well provided in all respects for the Num∣ber of Men, as any Kingdom of the World ever had one, and from whence they marched to Ardee, which the Enemy had abandoned. The King being ever upon Action, and obser∣ving the Country as he rid along, said, It was worth fighting for; and on the last Day of June, understanding that all the Irish Army were passed over the Boyne, the Night before, he ordered the whole Army to move in 3 lines toward that Ri∣ver, which was about 3 Miles distant from them; The Ene∣my being near our advanced Guards of Horse, commanded by Sir John Lanier, made their approaches very regularly, and by 9 they had got within 2 Miles of Drogheda. The King was in the Front of them, who observing there was an Hill to the E. of the Enemy's Camp; and N. from the Town, he went thither to view their Camp, which he found to be all along the River in two lines, and where he had a long Dis∣course with the Prince, Duke Scomberg, Duke of Ormond, Count Solms, Major General Scravenmoor, my Lord Sidney, and other great Officers, who were all curious in making their observations upon the Enemy, and Scravenmoor said they were Vne pettite Armee, for they could not reckon above 46 Regi∣ments that lay incamped; but the King answered that they might have a great many Men in the Town, that there was also an Hill to the S. W. beyond which part of their Army might lie incamped, and that possibly they did not shew all their Numbers; however, he said, he was resolved to see ve∣ry soon what they were.
From hence the King rid on to the Pass at the old Bridge, and stood upon the side of the Bank, within Musket-shot of the Ford, there to make his further observations on the Ene∣my's Posture and Camp, and in some time after rid about 200 Paces up the River, nigh the West of all the Enemy's Camp. Whilst his Army was marching in, he alighted, and sat him down upon a rising Ground, where he refreshed him∣self for about an hour; during which time some of the Irish, with long Guns came down, and shot at our Dragoons, who went down to the River to drink, and some of our went down to return the Complement to the former: And 'twas farther observed, that a Party of about 40 Horse advancing very slow∣ly, stood upon a plowed Field over-against the King for near half an Hour, and brought 2 Field-pieces with them, which they dropt by an Hedge on the said Ground, as was after∣wards known, though our Men did not then discover them, and one of which, when the King was mounted they fired. It killed 2 Horses, and a Man about a 100 Yards above where the King was; which was no sooner done, but immediately came a 2d,K. William wounded. which had almost been fatal to one of the greatest Lives upon Earth; for the Ball having first grazed on the Bank of the River, did in its first rising slant upon the King's Right-shoulder, took out a Piece of his Coat, and tore the Skin and Flesh, and afterwards broke the Head of a Gentle∣man's Pistol. My Lord Conningsby no sooner saw his Majesty struck, but he rid up and clapt his Handkerchief upon the Place; but the King himself took little notice, and kept on his pace, saying only, There was no necessity the Bullet should have come nearer, though the Enemy continued firing, who when they saw their shot somewhat disturb our Horse, they set up a most prodigious shout all over the Camp, as if the King's whole Army had been ruin'd, and drew down several Squadrons of their Horse upon a Plain towards the River, but in such a Place as they knew it was not possible for the English to come at them. Yet when our Guns came up, which was about 3 that Afternoon, and begun to play, they with∣drew their Squadrons into their Camp. The King about 9 at Night having called a Council of War, declared he was resolved to pass the River next Day, which Duke Scomberg at first opposed; but finding the King positive, he advised that part of the Army should be sent that Night about 12 towards Slane-bridge, and to pass the River thereabouts, and so get between the Enemy and the Pass at Duleek, but this Advice was not taken. Then they fell into a Debate about getting good and trusty Guides, when my Lord George Hamilton, who was by, immediately brought 4 or 5 of his Irish Iniskilling Officers, who knew the Fords ve∣ry
well, and took upon them to guide the Army next day; and here it was concluded how the Army should march, and who should command at the different Posts, which were or∣dered in this manner. Lieutenant General Douglas was to command the right Wing of Foot, and Count Shomberg the Horse, who were to march on early toward Slane-bridge, and other Fords up the River, to flank the Enemy, or get be∣tween the Enemy's Camp and Drogheda, whilst in the mean time a body of Foot forced their way at the Pass at Old-bridge. But while this was doing on our side, the Enemy were not ide; for they also called a Council of War, wherein Lieute∣nant General Hambleton, advised to send a Party of Dragoons to a Ford that was below the Town of Drogheda, which the English either knew not of, or else did not regard; and all the rest being 8 Regiments with their whole left Line towards the Bridge of Slane; but King James said, he would send 50 Dra∣goons up the River, which put Hamilton into a great Amaze∣ment, considering the Importance of the Place to be defended. Towards the close of the Evening the Cannon ceased on both sides, and the King gave Orders that every Soldier should be provided with a good Stock of Ammunition, and all to be ready at break of day to march at a minute's Warning, with every Man a green Bough or Sprig in his Hat, to distin∣guish him from the Enemy, who wore pieces of Paper on their Hats, The Word that Night being Westminster; he rid in Person about 12 at Night with Torches quite through the Army. At last,The Bat∣tle of the Boyne. Tuesday the 1st of July came, which proved to be a very clear Day, as if the Sun it self had a mind to see what the Event would be; when about 6 in the Morning Lieute∣nant General Douglas march'd towards the Right with the Foot, and Count Scomberg with the Horse; which being ob∣served by the Enemy, they drew out their Horse and Foot towards the left to oppose us: The Right Wing at first were ordered to pass all at Slane, but upon better Information, se∣veral Regiments were ordered to go over at other Fords be∣tween the Camp and that place. When the Horse approach'd the River, they found a Regiment of the Enemies Dragoons posted on the other side, who fired upon them, and then thought to have retreated to their main Body; but before they could do that, they were flanked in a Lane, and about 70 of their Number slain; which was almost all the Oppo∣sition they me with in passing the River that way; But when they advanced forwards, they found the Enemy drawn up in 2 Lines. Whereupon the English drew up in 2 Lines also, being 24 Squadrons of Horse and Dragoons, and but six Ba∣tallions of oot, which being, too few, Doulas sent for more▪ and in the mean time, according to my Lord Portland's Ad∣vice,
the Horse and Foot were mix'd Squadron with Batallion for their greater Security. However, more Foot coming up▪ this Figure was altered, and all the Horse drawn to the Right, by which they out-flanked the Enemy considerably. They found the Ground very difficult to pass by reason of a great Bog, and some Ditches that were in the way; but the Horse moving to the Right, and the Foot taking the Bog, so scared the Enemy, that they retreated in great haste towards Du∣leek; which was no sooner observed by Count Scomberg, but he fell in among their Foot with his Horse, and killed a great many. The King, who knew not the disadvantages of the Ground, but computing the time when he thought his Right Wing might well get over, ordered his Foot to attack the Pass at Old Bridge. During all this time, a great part of the Ene∣mies Army were marching towards Slane, and though our Cannon plaid upon them all the while, yet they kept their Order. The Blue Dutch Guards being to the Right, were the first that took the River at Old Bridge, they beat a March all the while, till they got to the River side, and then the Drums ceasing, in they went some 8 or 10 a-brest, and found themselves almost up to the middle presently in the Stream. The Enemy who had lined the Houses, Hedges, and Breast works on the other side, did not fire till our Men were got towards the midst of the River, and then a whole Peal of Shot came from all Quarters upon them, yet there was but one only observed to fall. He that was foremost was a Li∣eutenant of Granadiers, who, as he got footing on the other side, drew up 2 Files of Men, and then stoop'd, and they briskly fired over him at the next Hedge, which made the Irish quit it; with which the other were discouraged, and so all of them left their Posts, and were followed by a Volley of Shot from our Men advancing upon them. The Irish Foot ran scattering into the next Field, and before the Dutch could get well over, they were charged very bravely by a Squadron of Irish Horse, yet they were quickly beat off again. But by this time there appeared a great many Battalions and Squa∣drons of the Enemies all of a sudden from behind the little Hills that were there. However, the Dutch stood stoutly to it, as did also 2 French Regiments and Colonel St. Johns, who passed the River, about the same time as the other had done, a little lower: For tho' Lieutenant General Hamilton, who com∣manded at the Pass, advanced with a Party of Foot to the ve∣ry River, and himself and some others went into it, giving Orders at the same time, that my Lord Antrim's Regiment and some more should go and flank Sir John Hanmer's and Count Nassau's Regiments, who were also passing about 200 Yards still further; Yet neither would his Men stand the brunt, nor
could the other be perswaded to come within the smell of Hanmr's. However, s Hamilton retreated, a Squadron of their Horse charged our French so bravely, that about 40 of them broke quite thro' Monsieur La Calimot's Regiment, and wounded himself mortally; But they hapned to over-do their Work at this time, for being obliged either to go back the same way, or else to pass thro' the Village, and so to wheel to the Left to recover their own Men, they chose the latter, but were so paid off by some of the Dutch and Inniskilling Foot, that not above 6 or 8 of them got beyond the Village, most of their Horses stragling up and down the Fields. The Dutch and the rest of our Foot advanced all this while, so that the Irish Foot quitted a second Hedge they were per∣swaded to rally to, when another Body of Horse came down upon the Dutch, who neglected the Hedges, and met them bravely in the open Field, but kept so cloe, that it was im∣possible to break them; And as the Enemy came on, begun to fire by Platoons, and both flanked and fronted them, and so killed a great many of them before they drew off, yet not without some loss to themselves. By this time some of the French and Inniskilliners were got into the Field, from whence the Irish had disturbed our Troops with their Cannon the Day before, who obliged a fresh Squadron of Horse that was coming down upon the Dutch, to retreat with considerable Loss. All our Horse went over to the Right and Left, ex∣cept one Squadron of Danes, who passed the River, whilt our Foot were engaged, and advancing to the Front, Hambleton sent out 60 Horse, who charged the Danes so vigorously, that they retreated much faster than they went on, some of them never looking behind them, till they had crossed the River again: The want of Horse was so apparent in this place, that the very Countrey People cried out, Horse, Horse, which might have proved a fatal Mistake; for the Word going to∣wards the Right, and they mistaking it for Halt, stopt the Right Wing for near half an Hour, for that time well spent, might have done great Service. This and the Irish breaking thro' the French Regiment, hapned much at a time, which was thought was the Occasion of the Duke of Schomberg's going over so unseasonably; For in this Hurry he was killed near the little Village beyond the River. He received a mortal Wound thro' his Neck, and was cut in two places over the Head besides, and fell down from his Horse without speak∣ing one Word; Captain Foubert being also shot in the Arm, as he was getting him off: Dr. Walker likewise met with his Death's Wound near the same place, and was immediately stripp'd; for the Soth-Irish that followed the Camp, were got thro' already, and took off most of the Plunder. This Action bgan about a Quarter past 10, and was so hot for
above an Hour, that a great many old Soldiers said, They never saw brisker Work. But then the Irish retreated to a rising Ground, and there drew up again in Order, desgning to renew the Charge. Whilst this lasted at the Pass, the Left Wing of our Horse, consisting of Danes, Dutch, with Colonel Wolsley's Horse and Dragoons, passed the River at a very difficult and unusual Place, whilst the Danish Foot, with my Lord Cuts, and some others went over a little above them. The King, during all these Transactions, was almost every where before the Action began; he rid between his own Ar∣my and theirs with one only Dragoon, and had ordered eve∣ry thing in all other Places as well as might be, before he passed the River, which he did with the Left Wing of Horse, and that with as much difficulty as any other whatever: For his Horse was bogged on the other side, and himself forced to alight, till a Gentleman helped him to get his Horse out. But as soon as the Men were got upon the other Bank, and put into order, he drew his Sword, which yet was trouble∣some to him, his Arm being stiff with the Wound he had re∣ceived before, and march'd at the Head of them towards the Enemy, who were coming on again in good order upon our Foot that had now got over the Pass, and were advancing brave∣ly towards the Irish, tho' they were double their Number. But when thee 2. Bodies had got almost within Musket-shot of one another, the Enemy espy'd the Left Wing of our Horse mo∣ving towards them, at which they made a sudden halt, faced about, and retreated up the Hill again to a little Village cal∣led Dunmore, about half a Mile from the Pass. Our Men marching in good order, came up with them at this Village, when the Irish faced abont, and charged with so much brisk∣ness, that our Horse was forced to give ground, tho' the King was with them. Hereupon the King rid to the Iniskil∣lingers, and asked what they would do for him; and advan∣ced before them: Their Officer telling his Men who it was, and what Honour was done them. At the Head of these Men, the King received the Enemies Fire, and then wheeling to the left, that his own Men might have liberty to advance and fire, they erroneously retired after him above a 100 Yards; which made the King move to the Left to put him∣self at the Head of some Dutch Troops that were advancing, while in the mean time the Iniskillingers growing sensible of their Mistake, went on again to the Charge, and did good Service. Some of Duke Shomberg's Horse were here also, and behaved themselves well, taking one or two of the Ene∣mies Standards, while another Party commanded by Lieute∣nant General Cinkle, now the Renowned Earl of Athlone, charge in a Lane to the Left; but the Irish proved too ma∣ny
for them there, and so they were obliged to retreat. This being observed by a Party of Sir Albert Cunningham's Dragoons, and another of Colonel Levison's, the Officers or∣dered the Men to alight, and line an Hedge, as also an old House that flanked the Lane, from whence they poured in their Shot upon the Enemy. Lieutenant General Ginkle con∣tinued in the Rear of his Men, being heartily vexed at their retreating, and was in some Danger by our own Dragoons; For the Enemy being close upon him, they could not well distinguish. However, the Dragoons did a piece of excel∣lent Service in this Place, by stopping the Enemy, who came up very boldly; and our Horse having the Opportunity of Rallying here, as they did to the Right, the Enemy after near half an hours sharp Dispute, were bear back again from this place, and a great many of them killed. On the other side, Lieutenant General Hambleton finding that his Foot did not answer his Expectation, he put himself at the Head of the Horse, which being defeated by ours, he was wounded on the Head, and taken Prisoner. When he was brought to the King, he was pleased to ask him, Whether the Irish would fight any more? Yes, said he, an't please your Majesty, upon my Honour I believe they will; for they have a good Body of Horse still. When he named his Honour, the King looked a little aside at him, and repeated once or twice, Your Honour; intimating, That what he assumed upon his Honour, was not to be believed, since he had forfeited that before, by siding with the Earl of Tyrconnell; And this was all the Rebuke he gave him for his breach of Trust. Now you are to understand, that while all this happened on this side, our Men on the Right were making the best of their way over the Hedges and Bogs towards Duleek; and as they advanced, the Enemy drew off till they had heard what had happened at the Pass, and then they mended their pace, yet they could not make so much haste, but that several of them were killed, especially among the Foot, upon whom a Party of our Horse broke in, but they presently scattered among the Corn and Hedges, till they got beyond a great Ditch, which our Horse could not pass. But tho' when they got over the Pass, they drew up, and fired their great Guns upon our Men, who did the like on their side, as being not able easily to come at them with their small Shot; yet their Confusion was so great, that they left a great many Arms, with a Quantity of Ammunition in the Village of Duleek, and indeed all the Country over: Yet our Men were so illy as to blow up the Powder where-ever they found it, and few or none of the Enemy escaped, that fell into their Hands; for they shot them like Hares among the Corn, and in the Hedges, as they found them on their March.
Of all the Irish Commanders, none seemed to have been more active and vigilant, and done better Service that day, than Lieutenant General Hambleton,L. G. Ham∣bletn hs Character at the Boyne. whom at last we took Prisoner, as above-noted. But the Irish Foot were the first that ran, while the Count de Lauzun's Horse, and some Swiss which he had with him, and which were the best Men in the late King's Army, no way derogated from the good Opini∣on which was generally conceived of their Valour, but stood to it, till they saw themselves abandoned by the other, and then retreated in very good order: But the Irish made so much haste, that tho' our Foot pursued them above 4 Miles beyond the place of Battel, yet they could not overtake them, no more than some of the Horse who continued the Pursuit till Night, and then returned to the place where the Foot made an Halt, and where they remained at their Arms all Night. The Enemies whole Loss in this Battel, was generally com∣puted at 1500 Men, and of them some considerable Persons, as the Lord Dungan, the Lord Carling ford, and Sir Neal O Neal, &c. But one thing was observable that day, that most of their Horsemen who charged so desperately, were drunk with Brandy, each Man having that Morning received half a Pint to his Share: But it's like the Foot had not so large a Proportion, or at least did not deserve it so well. And on our side fell near 400,D. Schm∣berg's Cha∣racter and Age. which in it self, was inconsiderable, and not worth speaking, had not the Renowned Duke Schom∣berg been of the Number; a Person whom his very Enemies called a brave Man, and a great General: He was certainly a Person of the best Education in the World, and knew Men and Things beyond most of his Time, appearing courteous and civil to all, and yet had something always that looked so great in him, that commanded Respect from Men of all Stations and Qualities. As to his Person, he was of a mid∣dle Stature, Fair-complexion'd, a very sound, hardy Man of his Age, and sat an Horse incomparably well; and as he loved always to be neat in his Cloaths, so was he ever pleasant in his Conversation, and tho' he was 82 Years old when he died; yet when he came to be embowelled, his Heart, En∣trails and Brain were as sound and fresh, as if he had been an Youth of 20; so that it is probable he might have lived many Years longer, if Divine Providence had not otherwise ordered it. And as Monsieur allimot had followed that Great Man in all his Fortunes, while alive, so he did in his Death, for he died of his Wounds soon after him. As for the King himself, he received no manner of hurt, through God's Providence, in the Action, tho' he was in all the height of it, only a Cannon-ball carried away a piece of his Boot, but did all that the greatest of Captains could do upon this
Occasion; he chose the Field, drew up his Army, gave out his general Orders where-ever he was in Person, and demean∣ed himself throughout with that Gallantry, Resolution and Presence of Mind, so peculiar to himself, and was such a Poise for the Inclination of the Battel to his own side, that even his very Enemies confess'd, That if we changed Kings with them, they would fight the Battel over again with us. For the late King, during most of the time, stood with some Squa∣drons of Horse upon the Hill called Dunmore; and when the Officer that commanded saw from thence, how ill it went with their Friends below;The late K. James  for Frae. and, as it was said, moved his Ma∣ster that they might go down and help them: His answer was, What, will you leave me alone? and so march'd off to Duleek, and from thence in great haste to Dublin, where the first News was, That the English General was kill'd, and the Prince of Orange (as they called him) taken Prisoner; But of this they were quickly undeceived. My Lady Tyrconnell, when he got into the Castle, asked him what he would have for Supper; who told her what a Breakfast he had had, which made him have but little Stomach for his Supper. And next Morning after having told the Citizens that he was ne∣cessitated to yield to Force, and some such Stuff, and that they were become a Prey, to the Conqueror, but that he should not cease to labour their Deliverance as long as he liued; he posted away for Waterford, where he arrived the same day, taking care to have the Bridges broken down be∣hind him, for fear of being pursued, and where he went on board a Vessel, called, The Count de Isauzun, that was ready to receive him; But the Sier Foran, Chief of the Squadron, meeting him at Sea, obliged him to go on board one of his Frigats for his quicker Passage, and so he got once more into France. In the mean time the English Army rested the next day after the Battel, to refresh themselves, while 5 Battalions of Foot, and 4 Squadrons of Horse were detatch'd under the Command of Mounsieur Melonier, to take in Drogheda; the Governour whereof received the first Summons very indiffe∣rently, but at last considering better of it, and believing now the Irish Army to have been totally routed, he laid hold of the Offers made him; and the Garrison march'd out of the place with their Baggage only, leaving their Arms be∣hind them. King James had no sooner left Dublin, but the Protestants took Possession of it, and the Duke of Ormnd, whom the King sent thither, found Captain Farlo, Gover∣nour, who but two days before had been Prisoner; and the King himself, with his Army, arrived at Finglass, within 2 Miles of the City, on the 5th of July, from whence he went next day to St. Patrick's Church, but returned after Dinner
to the Camp, where 2 days after he set out his Declaration to the Irish, assuring all, under such a Quality, of his Prote∣ction; and then divided the Army, going himself with the greatest part of it beyond Dublin, in order to march West∣ward, sending at the same time Lieutenant General Douglass with 3 Regiments of Horse, 2 of Dragoons, and 10 of Foot towards Athlone, which is 50 Miles N. of Dublin. He having sent out a Party, while on his March, to get Intelligence, besides a great Prey of Cattle which they brought from the Enemies Quarters; they also took two Spies with Letters from Athlone, one of which was to advise one Tute to defend an Island nigh Mullingar, in which he had store of Horses, and several things of Value; And in another, which was from an Officer in Athlone, to his Father in the Country; There was Information given, That the Earl of Tyrconnell, the Duke of Berwick, and several great Officers were come to Limerick with a good Body of Horse, and that their Army would be there in 2 or 3 days; so that they would make ei∣ther a Hog or a Dog on't, as he express'd it; That the Dauphin was landed in England with a great Army; That the French had beat the English and Dutch Fleets; That Duke Schomberg was dead, and it was said the Prince of Orange was so too; That their King was gone for France, but it was no great matter, said he, where he was, for they were better with∣out him; which shews they had no great Opinion of him. And after the Letter was sealed, he writ on the out-side, Just now we have an Accout by a Gentleman that is come from Dub∣in, That Orange is certainly dead, so that all will be well again. From Mullingar, Douglass conntinued his March, and July 17th reached Athlone, Incamping within a quarter of a Mile of the Town, from whence he sent a Drum to summon it; But old Colonel Grace the Governour, fired a Pistol at him, and sent word, Those were the Terms he was for. The Place was strong by Nature and Art,Athlone be∣sieged in vain by L. G. Duglass and our Force not very considerable for that Enterprise; however, they contrived some Batteries, and planted 2 Field-pieces, which did the Enemies Guns some Damage and an 150 Men out of each Regiment were ordered to make and carry Fascines; And about the 19th they had a Battery of 6 Guns finish'd nigh the Bridge-end, which plaid upon the Castle, and made a small Breach towards the top; But the Train was too small for the Enterprise. However, the firing continued on both sides, but the Misfortune of Mr. Nelson the best Gunner, be∣ing killed with a small Shot, and the News that Sarssield was was advancing with 15000 Men to raise the Siege, made the General to send all his sick and wounded Men towards Mullingar, and next day in the he Evening called all the Colo∣nels to a Council of War, where he told the Necessity of
raising the Siege, especially since he had but very little Bread all the while; and that there was some Reason to believe the Irish Army would cut off his Communication from Dublin. So that there were Orders given to be ready to march at 12 that Night when the Baggage was sent away, and at break of day, the 25th, the Army followed, having lost about 30 Men before the Town; but their number was diminished thro' other Distasters, at least 3 or 400. The King in the mean time moving Westward, as we in∣formed you, reach'd Kill-Kullen-Bridge July 11th and be∣ing himself that Morning passing by the Ness, and seeing a Soldier robbing a poor Woman, he was so much inraged at it, that he beat him first with his Cane, and gave Orders that he, and divers others guilty of the like Disobedience should be hanged the Munday following. But tho' some Peo∣ple were so Audacious as to put an ill Construction upon this Action of the King's, yet it had so good an Effect upon that part of the Army, that the Country was secured from any Violence done by the Soldiers during that whole March to Commalin, Castle-Durmont, and so beyond Carlow; from whence he sent forward a Party of Horse under the Command of the Duke of Ormond, to take Possession of Kill-kenny, and so to secure the Protestants, and other Inhabitants of the adja∣cent Countries from being plundered by the Enemy, for by this time some of them begun to look behind them, and to return to take along what they had not Time nor Conveni∣ency to carry of at first. From Carlow the Army passed on to Kells, thence to Loughland-bridge, and so to Bennet's Bridge, 3 Miles to the N. E. of Killkenny; and upon the 19th of July His Majesty dined with the Duke of Ormond at his Castle of Killkenny, which had the good Luck to have been preserved by Count Lauzun with all the Goods and Furniture, and left in a good Condition, not without the Cellar well stored with what they had not time to drink at their going off. Munday the 21st the Army encamped at Carruck, from whence Major General Kirk, with his own Regiment, and Colonel Brewers, as also a Party of Horse were sent towards Waterford, more Forces designing to follow. When he came before the Place,Waterford surrendred. he sent to summon the Town by a Trumpet, who at first refused to surrender, there being 2 Regiments then in Garrison; However, their Refusal was in such civil Terms, that their Inclinations were easily understood, for soon after they sent out to know what Terms they might have, which were the same with Drogeda: But not liking those, they pro∣posed some of their own, which were rejected, and the heavy Cannon drawn down that way, and some more Forces order∣ed to march. When the Irish understood this, they agreed to march out with Arms and Baggage on the 25th, and were
conducted to Mallow: The Fort Dunannon, a strong and re∣gular Place, and well fortified with Guns was also surrendred into his Majesty's Hands, upon the same Terms with Water∣ford; which last place was view'd by the King the day it was given up, who took great care that no Persons should be di∣sturbed in their Houses, or Goods; and here the Lord Dovt was admitted into a more particular Protection from his Ma∣jesty, as having formerly applied himself, when the King was at Hillsborough, by Major General Kirk's means, to desire a Pass for himself and Family to Flanders. July the 27th,The Kings Proceed∣ings in Ire∣land. the King left the Camp at Carrick, and went towards Dublin, in order for England, which occasioned va∣rious Speculations; and some fears that the Affairs of this Kingdom were in no pleasing Posture. He left the Command of the Army to Count Solms, lay that Night at Carlow, and upon some Advice from England, exprest himself doubtful, whether to go over or return to the Army. However, he went on to Chappell Izard, and spent there some time to hear divers Complaints, and redress several Grievances; He pub∣lish'd a second Declaration to confirm the former, and order∣ed a weekly Fast: But having a further Account from Eng∣land, that several wicked Designs were discovered and pre∣vented, the loss at Sea not so considerable, and that the French had only burnt one small Village in the West of England, and so gone off again; he resolved to retu to the Army, which he did on the 22d of Aug. at Golden-bridge, and by the 27th eached Carrigallis, where Lieutenant General Douglas joined him next day; and on which in the Morning early, my Lord Portland, and Brigadeer Stewart were sent towards Li∣merick, with 700 Horse and Foot, who advanced within Cannon-shot of the Town,The Army march to  2. with little Opposition from the Enemy, and before whose return the King himself accompa∣nied by the Prince, my Lord Overkirk, Lieutenant General , and divers other great Officers, with about 300 Horse, went very near the Town, and drove in a Party of the Ene∣my's Horse, who made a shew of opposing them. On the 9th, the whole Army made its approach in excellent Order: For no sooner had the Pioneers cut the Hedges that were in the way, but the Men advanced, which made the Enemy draw backwards, till they came to a narrow Pass between a Bogs, within half a Mile of the Town, which was not above 150 Yards, and this full of Hedges and other Incumbrances▪ Herein, however, there were Lanes that led to the Town, the middlemost being the broadest, where stood the Irish Horse; To the right and left of which the Hedges were lined all with squeteers, of whom the English Foot were now got within less than 200 Yards. The detacht Party of Foot was upon the Advance towards the Center; The Horse a
little to the right of them, the Danes to the left; And the blew Dutch, with several English Regiments upon the right; And all this in such Decorum, that though the Hedges were very thick and troublesome, yet the Front kept all in a Line except the advanced Party, who went always some distance before: Whilst these things were going on thus, the King ordered 2 Field-pieces to be planted towards the left, where they could bear upon the Enemy's Horse, and fired from thence with so good Success, that the Enemy soon quitted that Post. And it is very remarkable, our English Foot were so little concerned, that tho' they knew the Enemy to be in the next Hedges; yet whilst the Pioneers were at work they would sit down, and ask one another, whether they thought they should have any Bread that day (for they began to want their Breakfasts, tho' some few of them went into the other World for it) while the Danes to the left stood with all the Care, and Circumspection in the World, and some of them observing the Posture of our Men, and hearing what they said, they thought they had no mind to fight; But they were quickly convinced to the con∣trary, for the Hedges were no sooner down, and one Front advancing in a narrow Field, and that the Irish fired a whole Volley upon them from the neighbouring Hedges, but some of the English cried out aloud, Ah, you Toads, are you there? We will be with you presently; and so they ran without any more ado along the Field, directly towards the Hedges where the Irish were planted, who thereupon quitted one Hedge after another; So as that the Danes advancing on the left, and the blew Dutch with the English on the right, and the Horse coming on in the Center; the Irish in less than half an hour after the Volley, were driven under their very Walls, and not a dozen Men lost on our side in all the Action; which if the Irish had managed their business well, would have cost us a great many more. But as soon as they got under their Walls, they plyed our Forces with their great Guns, that kil∣led several as they marched in, which the whole Army did before 5 in the Afternoon, and most of them incamp'd with∣in Cannon-short: Orders were given forthwith to draw 4 Field-pieces to Cromwell, alias Ieton's Fort to play upon the Town, and Out-works. The Danes according to their Post encamped to the left, where they found an old, Fort built by their Ancestors, which they were very proud of and from thence they fired 3 or 4 Field-pieces upon the Irish that lay intrenched between them and the Town. As soon as the Army was posted,The first siege of Limerick. the King ordered a Trum∣pet to be sent with a Summons to the Town; where, as was understood since, a great many of the Garrison were for Ca∣pitulating; But Monsieur Boisleau the Governours the Duke of Berwick, and Colonel Sarsfid, opposed it with a great deal
of heat, saying, There were great Divisions and Insurrections in England, that the Dauphin was landed there with 50000 Men, and that the Prince of Orange would quickly be obliged to withdraw his Forces thither: Hereupon Monsieur Boiselau sent the Trumpeter back with a Letter, directed to Sir Robert Southwel, Secretary of State; (for he would not, as 'tis sup∣posed, send directly to the King, because of avoiding to give him the Title of Majesty) importing, That he was surprized at the Summons, and that he thought the best way to gain the Prince of Orange's good Opinion, was by a vigorous Defence of the Town which his Master had entrusted him withal: And so the Cannon plaid on from both sides; and next Morning early, which was Aug. 13th, the King sent 8 Squadrons of Horse and Dragoons, and 3 Regiments of Foot, over the River which they passed, though it was very rapid and dangerous, and some of them en∣camped beyond the Ford, the rest was ordered thus. The King's Camp was on the Right, in the 2d Line next him the Horse-guards, and blew Duch; then some English and Duch Regiments; then the French and Danes, and behind all the Horse; tho' after some time they encamped rather convenient∣ly, than regularly. Neither were the Irish idle, but they fell to build Forts between the Besiegers and the Irish Town, one to the Sgate, and the other towards the . which proved serviceable to them; But not so much a disadvantage to us, as the surprizing of the Train, that was upon the Road to join the Army. It was reported,The English Train sur∣prized by the Irish. a French-man and one of the Gunners ran away, the Day before, from the Army, and got into Limerick, and gave the Enemy an account where the English Train lay; as also of those Guns, and other things, that were coming up, where the King's Tent stood, and divers other things that might be material for them to know, and therefore they plaid very briskly upon the Train, as also towards the King's Tent, which he was prevailed with at last to remove, but this was not all: For though on Munday, one Manus O Brian, a substantial Country Gentleman came to the Camp, and gave notice that Sarsfield with a Body of Horse had passed the River in the Night, and designed something extraordinary; yet he was so far from being taken notice of at first, that most People looked upon what he said as a Dream, and though a great Officer called him aside, as though he designed to have some more particular information; yet his main business was to in∣terrogate him concerning a Prey of Cattle in such a Place, which the Gentleman complained of afterward, saying, He was sorry to see General Officers mind Cattle more than the King's Honour. But after he had met with some acquaintance, he was brought to the King; who to prevent the worst gave or∣ders, that 500 Horse-should be made ready, and march to
meet the Guns; But where-ever the fault lay, it was certainly 1 or 2 in the Morning before the Party marched; which they did very softly, till after they saw a great light in the Air, and heard a strange rumbling Noise, which some conjectured to be the Train blown up, as it really was: For our Train having on Munday marched beyond Cullen, to a little old ruinous Castle called Ballenedy, not 7 Miles from the Camp: Sarsfield lurked all that day in the Mountains; and having notice; where and how our Men lay, he had those that guided him through By-ways to the very spot, where he fell in among them, before they were aware, and cut several of them to pieces, with a great many of the Waggoners, and some Country People that were carrying Provisions to the Camp. The Officer commanding in chief, when he saw how it was, commanded to sound to Horse, but those that endeavoured to fetch them up, were killed as they went out, or else saw it was too late to return: The Officers and others made what re∣sistance they could, but they were every Man at length obliged to shift for themselves; so that, there were in all about 60 Persons killed; but it did not end here: For the Irish got up what Horses they could meet withall, belonging either to the Troops or Train, some broke the Boats, and others drew all the Carriages, and Waggons, with the Bread, Ammunition, and as many of the Guns, as they could get in so short a time into one heap, they filled the Guns with Powder, and put their Mouths into the Ground, that they might thereby certainly split. What they could pick up in an hurry they took away with them, and then laid a Train to the rest, which being fired at their going off, blew up all with an astonishing Noise, but for all that 2 of the Guns received no damage: The Irish took no Prisoners on this occasion, only a Lieutenant of Colo∣nel Earl's being sick in a House hard-by, was stript and brought to Sarsfield, who used him very civilly, and told him, if he had not succeeded in that Enterprize, he would have gone for France. The party of Horse that was sent from the Camp, came up after the business was over in sight of the Enemy's Rear; But wheeling towards the left, to endeavour to inter∣cept the Enemy's Passage over the Shannon, they unhappily went another way. The News of this Adventure was very unwelcome in the Camp, and even the very private Men shewed their concern at it; However the Siege went on, and the Trenches were opened the 17th, and a Battery raised be∣low the Fort, to the Right of the Trenches, which dismount∣ed some of the Enemy's Cannon, and the day following his Majesty himself was in great danger: For while the Enemy fired very thick, he rid softly up towards Cromwell's Port, and as his Horse was directly entring the Gap, he was staid by a Gentleman who came to speak to him, when in the ve mo∣ment
there struck a 24 Pounder in the very Place, which would have struck the King and his Horse too, to pieces, if his usual good Angel had not defended him: It struck the Dust all about him however, though he took little notice of it, but alighting came and laid himself down on the Fort among all the Dust. It will be an endless thing to trace eve∣ry particular of the Attacks and Defences; and therefore I shall only observe that on Wednesday the 27th of Aug. after a Breach had been made nigh St. John's Gate, over the black Battery of about 12 Yards in length, and pretty flat; The King gave order that the Counterscarp should be at∣tackt that Afternoon; and had it not been for one Errour, which yet could not well be avoided, the place had been in∣fallibly carried: However to shew you the bravery of our Men upon this occasion, we will give you a few particulars. About half an Hour after 3 the signal being given by firing 3 Pieces of Cannon, and the Granadeers standing in the fur∣thermost Angle of the Trenches, they leapt over, and ran toward the Counterscarp, firing their Pieces, and throwing in their Granadoes, which gave the Irish the Allarm, who had all their Guns ready, and discharged great and small Shot upon them as fast as possible, who were not behind with them in either; so that in less than 2 Minutes there was such a ter∣rible Noise, that you would have thought the Skies ready to rent in sunder: Captain Carlile of my Lord Drogheda's Regi∣ment, ran on with his Granadeers to the Counterscarp; and though he was wounded twice, between that and the Trenches, yet he went bravely on, and commanded his Men to throw in their Granadoes; but leaping into the dry Ditch under the Counterscarp, an Irish Man below shot him dead: However the Lieutenant encouraged the Men, and they boldly mount∣ed the Counterscarp, and all the rest of the Granadeers were as ready as they, which so daunted the Irish, that they began to throw down their Arms, and ran as fast as they could into the Town; our Men perceiving this, entred the Breach with them pell-mell, and above half the Earl of Drogheda's Grana∣deers with some others were actually within that Place, and they had certainly carried it, had not the Regiments that were to second the Granadeers upon the Counterscarp stopt there, as having no orders to go any farther: For the Irish were all running from the Walls quite over the Bridge into the English Town, but seeing there were but a few of the Eng∣lish that entred, they were with much a-do perswaded to rally; And those that were in, finding themselves not seconded, and their Ammunition spent, thought of nothing now but to re∣treat; But some were shot, others taken, and very few of the rest who came out again, but were wounded, which so elaed the Spirits of the Irish, that they ventured upon the
Breach again, and from the Walls, and every other where did so pester our Men upon the Counterscarp; that after nigh 3 Hours resisting. Bullets, Stones, broken Bottles (from the very Women who daringly stood on the Breach, and were nearer our Men than their own) and whatever else could be thought on to destroy, it was at last thought safest to return to the Trenches. But this was not our only Loss, for while this Work was at the hottest, a Brandenburg Regiment, who behaved themselves very well, being got upon the Black-Bat∣tery, the Enemies Powder happened to take fire, which un∣happily blew up a great many of them, the Men, Faggots, Stones, and what not, flying into the Air with a most terri∣ble Noise; and tho' my Lord Cuts, who was commanded by the Duke of Wirtemberg, to march towards the Spur at the S, Gate, beat in the Irish that appeared on that side, yet he lost several of his Men, and was himself wounded; For he adventurously approaching within half Musket-shot of the Gate, all his Men lay open to the Enemies Shot, who lay se∣cure within the Spur and the Walls. The Danes demeaned themselves also gallantly at their Post; but the mischief on't was, there was but one Breach. The Action was very brisk every where, and there was one continued fire both of great and small Shot, from half an hour after 3 till 7, insomuch that the Smoke which went from the Town, reached in one uninterrupted Cloud to the Top of a Mountain at least 6 Miles off. The King, who stood nigh Cromwel's Fort all the time, when the business was over, return'd to his Camp, very much con∣cerned at the Disappointment, as indeed was the whole Ar∣my, where a mixture of Anger and Sorrow might be seen in every body's Countenance, as foreseeing the taking of the Place, and the Reduction of the Kingdom would cost the Charge and Fatigue of another Campagne; to say nothing of the present Loss, which amounted at least to 500 slain up∣on the Spot, besides wounded, which were not less than double the number: Wherefore the King resolved to raise the Siege, and to that purpose,Th Siege raised, and the King goes for England. after he had constituted the Lord Sidney and Thomas Conningsby Esq; since Lord Conningsby, Lords Ju∣stices of Ireland, left the Command of the Army to Count Solms, who some time after going for England, it was conigned into the Hands of the brave Lieutenant-General Ginkle: He embarked with the Prince of Denmark, and several other Lords, at Duncannon, on the 5th of  arrived the next day in the Evening in Kings-Road near Bristol, and on the 9th a Windsor, not without a more than ordinary Joy all over the Kingdom, leaving the Army in Ireland to march into their Winter-Quarters; and so at present we shall leave them, and see what was doing in England all this while.
The Apprehensions of the Disaster that befel us from the French Fleet, was no sooner over, but the Queen set all hands on work, and in a very short time fitted up such a Fleet of Men of War, that the Enemy were so far from looking it in the Face upon the Main, that they began now to be very ap∣prehensive of their own Coast; And indeed it was a general Supposition in England, that there were some Designs formed at that time upon France it self; and it might, for ought I know, be contrived so on purpose to amuse such as wished us not well. For I remember very particularly, that People were somewhat surprized to hear that the Fleet was arrived in Cork-Harbour in Ireland, and that my Lord of Malburrough was landed there the 21st of Sept. with the Forces under his Com∣mand; where on the day following, 5 or 600 Seamen, and others of the Marine Regiment, were imployed to draw the Cannon along, and to mount them before the Town, which they did with great Cheerfulness and Bravery, with the Duke of Graon at the Head of them, tho' 2 Troops of Dragoons and a Body of Foot appeared without the Town; who, upon our Mens firing some Field-pieces upon them retired. The Eal was to act upon this Expedition in Concert with some other Troops that were towards that Part of Ireland before, and therefore that very Day the Duke of Wirtemberg sent Dean Davis unto him, and to Major-General Scravenmore, to whom my Lord upon his Arrival had dispatch'd an Express that he would forthwith joyn him, to give them an Account that he was upon his March to joyn them with a Detach∣ment of 4000 Foot. And because there was a Report that the Duke of Berwick design'd to raise the Siege, Major-General Scravenmre sent the Dean back to hasten the Duke's March, and the day following ordered a Party of Horse to go and co∣ver the Duke's Foot. The same Afternoon Major-General Tetteau, with a Party of a 1000 Men, having drawn down some Cannon to the Fair Hill, resolved to attack one or both of the new Forts, and new Shannon-Castle. But the Enemy no sooner perceived his Men posted in order to that Design, then they set fire to the Suburbs between him and them, and so deserting both the Forts and Castle, retired in haste into the City; Which our Men no sooner saw, but they possessed themselves of Shannon-Castle, planted some Guns thereon, and from thence plaid both upon the Fort and Town. Major Ge∣neral Scravenmore was come at the same time with his Horse, and took up his Quarters at Kill-Abbey. On the 26th the Duke of Wirtemberg, with his Danes, and another Detatch∣ment of Dutch and French Foot, came and encamped on the North-side of the Town; and the Enemy the day following having deserted their Works at the Cat-fort, besieg∣ed and . without a Blow struck, our Forces took possession of it; and having planted a
Battery there, they threw both their Bombs into the City, and paid their Guns upon the Fort, from the Friars Garden, and another Battery above the Fort near the Abbey: Having moreover got a Church into our possession, Scravenmore or∣dered a Party of Men into it, and laid Boards cross the Beams for them to stand upon, who from thence did very good Ser∣vice, in galling the Irish within the Fort; All which, together with another Battery made by Red-Abbey, which plaid against the City-wall, and made a Breach therein, brought the Be∣sieged to move for a Treaty. Whereupon a Truce was grant∣ed till next Morning; when the Besieged not accepting the Conditions that were proposed, the Cannon began to play again very furiously, and made a considerable Breach; and when any of the Enemy appeared on the Wall near it, they were rased off by the small Ordnance from the Cat; And lest the Enemy might make their Escape thro' the Marsh, there were 40 Men placed the Night before in the Brick-Yard, near Kill-Abbey, to prevent it: On the same Day in the Afternoon, the Danes from the N. and 4 Regiments of English from the S. under Brigadier Churchill, passed the River up to the Arm∣pits, into the E. Marsh, in order to storm the Breach that was made there in the City-Wall. The Granadiers under my Lord Colchester, led the Van, and march'd forward, tho' all the while exposed to the Enemies fire; with them march'd also the Duke of Grafton, my Lord O Brian, Collonel Granville, and a great many more, as Volunteers. The Van imme∣diately posted themselves under the Bank of the Marsh, which seemed to be a Counterscarp to the City-Wall. In which Approach the Duke of Grafton received a mortal Wound on the point of his Shoulder; The Salamander also, and another Vessel came up with the Morning-Tide, and lay at the end of the Marsh, directly before the City-Wall, plaid their Cannon at the Breach, and threw Bombs likewise into the City. All this being hot Work, made the Irish beat a Parley, and Colo∣nel Makilicut who commanded in the Place, sent the Earl of y∣rone and Colonel Ricaut to agree the Capitulation, who con∣cluded, That the Garrison, consisting of about 4000 Men, should be all Prisoners of War, as well Officers as Soldiers; That the Old Fort should be delivered up within an Hour, and 2 Gates of the City the next Day;Cok surren∣dred. That all the Protestant Prisoners should be forthwith released; That all the Arms as well of the Soldiers as Inhabitants should be secured; and that there should be an exact Account delivered up of the War∣like Ammunitions and Provisions in the Magazines. Matters being thus happily terminated in relation to Cork, the very same Afternoon a Party of about 500 Hose,Kingsale be∣sieg'd. was sent under the Command of Brigadier Villars to infst King∣sale; upon whose Approach the Irish quitted the Town, set
it on fire, and retired into the Old Fort; and on the 1st of Oct. the Earl of Marlborough advanced as far as Five-Mile-Bridge, and next day reach'd the Town of Kingsale then in Possession of his own Men, who quenched the Fire, and that Evening posted his Troops toward the New Fort, as Major-General Tettau with 800 Men next Morning early passed the River in Boats, and stormed the Fort with very good Suc∣cess: For several Barrels of Powder at the same time acci∣dentally taking fire, blew up nigh 40 of the Enemy; where∣upon the rest flying into an old Castle in the midst of the Fort, were a great many of them killed before they could get thither, and all that made resistance, as the English scaled the Walls, were cut to pieces; so that of 450 Men in the Fort, about 200 were blown up and killed, and the rest submitting to Mercy, were made Prisoners. My Lord having gained the Old Fort, resolved to make as quick Work as he could with the new one, which was far the more consi∣derable of the two; For the Weather was now grown very bad, and Provisions scarce, and, withal, the Men began to be sickly, which made him judge it the best way to attack the Place briskly. However, he sent the Governour a Sum∣mons to surrender; who returned answer, It would be time enough to talk of that a Month hence. Whereupon the Cannon being planted, they began to batter the Place two ways, and upon the 9th day of the Month, the Men got near the Counterscarp, on the 12th in the Morning 6 Pieces of Can∣non were mounted at the Danes Attack which was to the Left, and 2 Mortars at the English, which fired all Day, and the Mortars continued all Night; and more Guns were planted on the English Battery the two succeeding Days; for the Danes on their side had made a pretty large Breach: Then they sprung a Mine with very good Success, and were preparing for another. Being now become Masters of the Counterscarp, the Cannon plaid the 15th all the Morning long, and every thing was now ready to lay the Galleries over the Ditch,Surrendred. when the Enemy beat a Parley about sur∣rendring the Fort; which being done, the Articles were a∣greed to and signed: By them the middle Bastion was to be delivered up next Morning, and the Garrison being above 1200 Men to march out the day after with their Arms and Baggage, and to be conducted to Limerick. There were about 200 Men killed and wounded in the several Attacks our Men made, but there were some Amends made to the Survivors, at least some of them; For besides a very consi∣derable Magazine, there was great Plenty of all kinds of Provisions in the Fort, and good Liquor of all sorts. With this successful Expedition we shall end the Affairs of Ireland for this Year, there being no other Action of considerable
Moment performed there; but only observe that all Lein∣ster was reduced under the King's Obedience by taking of these two Towns, which was no small Advantage to his In∣terest, considering that Province is the most Southern of all Ireland, and consequently the nearest to France; and not on∣ly so, but as it has the most convenient Ports in all that King∣dom, and perhaps in the World, so there the French King generally landed all his Supplies for that Countrey; and was therefore afterwards forced to fetch a great Compass to do it, which did not a little impede his Affairs. And now we are at leisure to look a little how things have gone on the Con∣tinent. How considerable soever the weight of the Confederacy seemed already to be,The Duke of Savoy en∣ters into the Confedera∣cy, and the manner of it. it was this year further augmented by the Addition of another Prince, who, tho' he were in him∣self as light as a Feather, yet the Situation of his Country was such, as to make both Parties court him with utmost Ap∣plication, tho' in a different manner, and with different Suc∣cess. The Duke of Savoy had all along since the Commence∣ment of the War, profess'd to stand Neutral, which per∣haps did not very well please neither Party concern'd in it; tho' the French, who, one should think, had most reason to be content of any, first appear'd to be most dissatisfied: For not pleas'd to have before put the Duke upon Imprisoning, Exiling and destroying his Protestant Subjects, the poor Vau∣dois, they declare themselves now not satisfied with the pre∣tended Neutrality, which was no other than a meer Chimera, and therefore demanded he should put the Cittadels of Verceil and Turin into their Hands for the Security of his Word, which were hard Lines. However, the Duke put as good a meen upon the matter as he could, and some time was spent, if not gained by the Duke, in sending of Couriers to the King upon the Subject, and receiving others from him; which tho' it did for a while, yet a new Accident happened that made the French much more pressing and peremptory for a positive Answer: For being inform'd that the Emperor had at last granted what the Duke of Savoy had so long desired; that is to say, to be acknowledged King of Cyprus, and to be address'd to under the Title of His Royal Hghness, which the Emperor had formerly refused, upon good Considerations of∣fered him by the Duke, they became somewhat more than suspicious of the Duke's Fidelity; and his declaring there∣upon to the French King by his Minister. That he had no design to abandon the Friendship of France, or to do any thing contrary to the Treaties that were between that Crown and him, were look'd upon as Terms so general, and of so comprehensive a Latitute, that they would not pass for cur∣rent Coin in the French Court: Wherefore Mounsieur Cati∣nat,
who was to Command the French Troops on that side▪ did, before Summer was well begun, pass the Mountains, and arrived at Turin, leaving an Army of about 18000 Men to rendezvous in the Dauphinate, and so to follow him into the Duke's Territories; which they soon did, and for a time demeaned themselves without committing any Hostility. For the Duke himself did not only offer to observe an exact Neutrality, and for Security of Performance, to furnish the King with 2000 Foot, and a 1000 Horse; But the Pope's Nuncio at Turin also thrust himself in to Patch up the Accom∣modation, tho' without being able to find any Medium: For Catinat not satisfied with any Offers that were made, posi∣tively demanded Verceil for a place of Arms, protesting that he could not listen to any Accord, but upon those Conditions. And the Duke had as little reason to be pleased with him or his Master, upon this Head: But tho' it is manifest he had by this time made Choice of his side, yet all the Artifice ima∣ginable was used to spin out a little more time, because other∣wise he would very much endanger his Country, since the Spaniards from the Milnese were not in a Condition to succour him; And this was attended with new Propositions, from France, which in substance contained, That the King was wil∣ling to refer his Concerns to the Pope and Republick of Venice, upon Condition the Duke would put Verceil, Carmagnole, and Suza into the Pope's Hands, till the End of the War. But the Duke being no longer willing to mince a Matter that was al∣ready but too much suspected, and must necessarily be known, declared, That he had now made Choice of his Party; and that he was engaged with the Emperor, and could not go from his Word. However, in regard the Alliance which he had made with his Imperial Majesty, tended no further than to oppose the unjust Designs of his Most Christian Majesty, to defend himself from Oppression, and secure the Repose of all Italy; If his Majesty would put Cazal and Pignerol into the Hands of the Republick of Venice till the End of the War, and that all Differences between them were decided, he would lay down his Arms, and for some time put into the Pope's Hands one of his Towns, as a Pledge for the Observa∣tion of his Word. But France, neither absolutely, nor for any time had a mind to hearken to such Conditions, and so came to an open Rupture; the Consequence whereof, was the immediate Liberty of the Vaudois, and Incouragement to arm themselves against France, the publick avowing of the Duke's Treaties first with the Emperor, and afterward with Spain; each of which we shall give you the Particulars of, partly as being congruous to the Design of our Work, but more in re∣lation to what afterward has followed, touching the infringe∣ments of them, and first take that with the Emperor.
His Imperial Majesty, sensibly touched with the re-iterated Menaces with which the King of France for some time since has threatned the Duke of Savoy, which visibly tend to his Oppression, because of the inviolable Adherence of his Royal Highness to his Imperial Majesty; and moreover, under∣standing, that his Most Christian Majesty has with an Army invaded the Dominions of the said Duke, on purpose to con∣strain him to surrender into his Hands his two Principal For∣tresses; and withal, to furnish him with 2000 Foot, and 2 Regiments of Dragoons, to assist him to invade the States of Milan: His Imperial Majesty judg'd himself oblig'd to suc∣cour a Prince who has always testified his Affection to the Emperor; for which Reason he has sent the Sieur Abbot Vin∣cent Grimani, with all necessary Orders, and full Power, to Negotiate, Treat, and agree with his Royal Highness, an Alliance, for the Establishment of such things as concern his Imperial Majesty, and to procure the Security of his Royal Highness: To which end his Serene Highness, Victor Ama∣deus II. Duke of Savoy, and the aforesaid Abbot Griman, have concluded the Articles following: 1. HIS Royal Highness engages not to enter into any Treaty of Alliance with the Most Christian King,The Treaty between the Emperour and the Dke of Saoy. without con∣sent of the Emperor, but to adhere firmly to the Emperor as a faithful Prince to the Empire. 2. That he shall Act by joint Consent with the Emperor, and the rest of the Confederate Princes. 3. That he shall employ his Forces jointly with those of the Em∣peror and his Confederates, against France and her Adherents. On the other side, the Abbot Grimani, in the Name of the Emperor and Empire, promises, 1. NOT to enter into any Treaty of Peace, or Truce with France, unless his Royal Highness be therein compriz∣ed. 2. That the Emperor shall take such Order, that the Governour of Milan shall employ all the Forces of that State, for the Preser∣vation of his Royal Highness's Territories, and that the Spanish Fleet shall take care to secure the City and Country of Nice. 3. That his Imperial Majesty shall forthwith send 6000 of his choicest Men to join his Highness's Forces; which his Imperial Ma∣jesty engages to pay without their pretending to any Winter Quar∣ters in Piedmont. 4. That his Imperial Majesty shall endeavour to the utmost of his Power, that the Vaudois, the French Exiles, and the 8000 Men, which the Marquess of Rorgomainero, Ambassadour of Spain, has promised shall be sent into Piedmont, shall altogether
join the Troops of his Royal Highness; the Emperor leaving to him the Care of Employing all those Forces jointly with the Governour of Milan, as they shall find most convenient. 5. That the Emperor and the Confederates shall endeavour the Restauration of Pignerol into the Hands of his Royal Highness, either by Force of Arms, or by a Treaty, without laying any claim to Montferrat, which his Imperial Majesty renounces, not∣withstanding the Ancient Treaties. 6. Lastly, His Imperial Majesty shall lay no claim to any thing that may happen to be won from France, on that side, but leaves his Royal Highness, and the Governour of Milan to agree that Point together. The Imperial Troops, in pursuance to this Treaty, were ordered forthwith to march into Italy, but they met with many Difficulties in their Passages; however, we shall hear more of them hereafter, and think it more proper in this Place to give you the other Articles with Spain, for the Rea∣sons above-mentioned, and they were these that follow. IN regard there is a French Army come into Italy, with a Design to act openly against the State of Milan; and for that the said Army is quartered in the Territories of his Royal Highness of Savoy, in revenge of the Affection which he bears to his Imperial Majesty, and to constrain the said Duke to surrender into the Hands of the King of France two of his strongest Garrisons, and a part of his Forces, that the said King may be the better in a Condition to invade Mi∣lan, &c. Therefore, for the common Defence of both Ter∣ritories, the Count of Fuensalida, in the Name of the King his Master, and the Count of Brandisso, on the behalf of Sa∣voy, have reciprocally agreed and concluded, 1. THat between his Catholick Majesty,The Treaty between the King of Spain and the Duke of Savoy. Charles II. King of Spain, &c. and his Royal Highness Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy, there shall be a real and strict defensive Alliance, to be observ'd inviolably, till both Parties shall happen to male Peace by common Consent; nor shall either Party make any Treaty of Peace, Truce, or any other Alliance with France, without the joint Consent of both. And his Catholick Majesty shall cause his Royal Highness of Savoy, so far as concerns him, to be compre∣hended in the Alliances with his Imperial Majesty, his Britanni Majesty King William, the States-General, and all his other Allies, without any Exception. 2. That there shall neither Peace, nor Truce be made, unless what may have been Conquer'd or Vsurp'd by the Enemy, within the State of Milan, or the Territories of Savoy, either by open
Force or otherwise, be effectually restored in its first Condition, in∣to the Hands of those from whom it was taken away. 3. Both Parties mutually oblige themselves to assist each other with the Forces they already have, or may have, for the Defence of the Territories of his Royal Highness, as if it were the Defence of each one's proper Right. 4. For the Execution of what is above concluded, the Count of Fuensalida shall cause his Army to march forthwith, consisting of 8000 Horse, and between 8 and 9000 Foot, during this present War; which Army shall enter Piemont, by the way of Verceil, under the Count of Lovignie, &c. 5. That the said Army shall have 12 Pieces of Cannon, with all necessary Ammunition, at the Expence of his Catholick Ma∣jesty. 6. That so soon as the Army shall be encamp'd under the Cannon of Verceil, his Royal Highness shall join it with 4 Regiments of Infantry, and 2 of Dragoons. 7. When the Forces are joined, they shall march towards Turin, part by the way of Imbree, the rest as shall be thought most con∣venient. Also two more Regiments of Foot, and 400 Horse shall join the said Army of his Royal Highness, unless the said City shall happen to be besieged, taken, or blocked up; and so being Friends, they shall be still ready where Action calls them, and his Royal Highness shall think fit to command them. 8. In case Turin, or any other Garrison of his Royal High∣ness shall happen to be besieged, taken, or blocked up, the Army of his Majesty shall be obliged to relieve it, in conjunction with his Royal Highness. 9. In case the Enemy shall march to meet our Army, his Roy∣al Highness shall cause his Troops to march either to join the said Army, if it be possible, or else to Attack the Enemy's Rear. 10. If the Enemy's Army shall march towards the State of Milan, his Royal Highness shall forthwith send away his Troops to join the Army of the Allies, and jointly to Attack the Enemy, for the Defence of the State of Milan; the said Troops being obliged to observe a constant, Amity, for the common Defence up∣on all Occasions, when requir'd, unless they shall consent to divide them. 11. His Excellency shall take care to furnish his Army with Bread, when it is to march into Piedmont, and for so long time as it shall there remain: But when the Army shall march far∣ther than Verceil, and that there shall be need of more Waggons for Munitions and Provisions, his Royal Highness shall furnish the Army with ready Money at a reasonable Price, and the same thing shall be done in the State of Milan to serve the Troops of Savoy▪
12. And for the better furnishing his Catholick Majesty's Army in Piemont with Bread, his Excellency shall cause Meal and Wheat to be carried to Verceil; and if by reason of the Enemy, or any other Accident, the Corn cannot be carried to the Place where his Catholick Majesty's Army lies; his Royal Highness shall furnish him, and shall be re-imbursed his Charges; and that Mony shall be allowed to the Troops of his Royal Highness, coming into the State of Milan, if they cannot be furnished with Corn, as has been said. 13. The same thing shall be observed in reference to the Warlike Ammunition, for the Service of the Troops, while the Artillery shall be at the Charges of his Catholick Majesty. 14. Forage, or the use of Hay and Grass in the Field, shall be taken indifferently on both sides, in the place where the Forces of his Catholick Majesty, and his Royal Highness shall be joyned toge∣ther, both submitting to Military Discipline, without committing any Disorders; And both Allies shall give Orders to their Victu∣allers to repair to the Army, and sell their Provisions at a moderate Price. 15. And because the present Alliance is only defensive, 'tis de∣clared, That when the Army of France shall begin to commit Ho∣stility, either in the Territories of Milan, or those of his Royal Highness, it shall be then changed into an Offensive Alliance. And in case that Pignerol and Casal shall be taken from the French, the first shall be remitted into the Hands of his Royal Highness, the other shall belong to his Catholick Majesty by Right of Conquest, yet so as no way to prejudice the Right and Possession which his Royal Highness has taken of Monferrat, by Vertue of the Treaty of Chie∣rasco. And in case there shall be any thing won from the Enemy in any Place, where his Royal Highness has any particular Right, it shall be parted in Halves, by reason of the great Damages which his Royal Highness suffers from the Enemies Army that lies in his Countrey, having put off the March which they had designed, to make an Invasion into Milan, to which the Territories of his High∣ness serves as a Bulwark, being nevertheless burthen'd by an unex∣pressible Charge of the French Army. And in regard the Count of Fuensalida takes Charge of his Catholick Majesties Army, which is kept in Pay for the Delivery and Defence of Milan, he is also oblig∣ed to assign Winter-Quarters in the Territories of Milan, to the Troops of his Royal Highness, and to put them into such a Condition, that they may be fit for Service the next Campaign. The Manner and Form being concerted between his Royal Highness and his Eminence in Person, or between their Ministers, as also the Number of well-disciplined Men; his Excellency having all the while Power to agree for Money for the Winter-Quarters, except Forage.
The Ratification on both sides to be made by the Count of Fuensa∣lida in two Months, and by the Count of Brandisso in six Weeks. Concluded at Milan, June 3d. 1690. Sign'd the Count of Fuensalida. Count Charles E∣manuel de Brandisso. I shall not now enter upon the particular Consequences of these Alliances, as having some things nearer home first to observe: And here I cannot but note, That as the Enemies of France increased, so she seemed equally, or rather more to increase in Power, being very formidable this Year by Sea, of which we have already instanced the Particulars, and no whitinferior by Land, as will manifestly appear in the Course of this Discourse, and of which the Confederates especially on Flanders and the Lower Rhine-side seemed to be sensible: And therefore they concerted their matters thus, That the Army of the States should oppose in Flanders that of France commanded by the Duke of Luxemburg,The Cam∣pagne in Flanders. while the Elector of Brandenburg should upon the Banks of the Moselle withstand the Forces commanded by the Marquess de Boufflers. But the French, according to their usual forwardness, having taken the Field betimes, the States Troops were constrain'd to draw out of their Garrisons to attend the Enemy, before those of Brandenburg were come to the Posts assigned them, which gave Boufflers an opportunity to encamp between the Sambre and the Meuse, from whence he could joyn the Duke of Luxemburg whenever there was occasion for it. The Dutch Generals; under these Circumstances, were obliged to encamp at the Pieton, the most advantageous Post of all Flanders, and there to stay till the Brandenburg-Army took the Field, and thereby cause the Enemy to divide their Forces. But while they lay at Pieton, they understood that the Duke of Luxemberg drew near the Sambre, with a Design to cross that River between Namur and Charleroy, in order to waste the Spanish Countries, and put them under Contribu∣tion; Which News so allarm'd the Spaniards, that tho' they could do little of themselves, yet they pressed the Dutch ex∣treamly to oppose the French Intentions; wherein they the more easily prevailed, since Prince Waldeck was of himself dis∣posed to it, out of the Consideration he had of what Impor∣tance it was to keep the French beyond the Sambre; and there∣fore he decamped from the Pieton June 3d, N. S. and detatch'd the Count of Berlo the same day with a Detachment of 1500 Horse, to observe whether the Enemy endeavour'd to pass the Sambre, or no, who was followed by the Count of Flodorp with 4 or 5 Regiments of Cavalry, to assist him, or make good his Retreat; the Count of Webennum being also posted on this
side a narrow Lane which was to be passed thro' before they could come at the Enemy. Berlo being advanced as far as the Village of Fleuri,The Battle of Flerus. found that a good part of the French Army had already passed the Sambre, and posted themselves against the Village which they kept to their Backs; of all which Prince Waldeck, who was po∣sted between Mellin and Fleuri, was instantly informed. Now the Enemy having notice of Berlo's Approach, marched di∣rectly towards him, while the Duke of Luxemberg presently dispatch'd away several Troops privately thro' By-ways, to fall upon him in the Rear, which made Berlo send for more Suc∣cours, and chiefly of Foot; but instead of sending him more Force, they gave him Orders to retreat; Yet he receiving not those Orders till he was almost environed on every side; he was obliged to put himself in a Condition to defend a narrow Lane, which he had possess'd before by his Dragoons. The Enemy charged him very vigorously, and there he lost his life, as did also Major Castleman and some other Officers. The Count of Flodorp was also advanced too far to retreat without fighting; and the Cavalry indeed stood stoutly to it, but be∣ing oppress'd with Numbers, they were forced to retreat to Monsieur Webbenum, who commanded the 3d Detachment, and was posted on the other side of an Hedge. Some Squa∣drons of the Enemy that pursued Flodorp, ventured thro' the Hedge after him; but they were so vigorously repulsed, that they were constrained to make more haste back again. When this was done, all this Body of Horse joyned the Army which was drawn up in Battel-aray not far off: And thus ended the Work of that Day. The whole Army stood in order of Battle all that Night, and the next Morning they understood by a Deserter, that the Duke of Luxemburg was resolved to fight: But 2 Spies that made it their Trade to be double ones, re∣ported presently after, that Luxemburgh was repassing the Sambre; And in this uncertainty Prince Waldeck continued till 8 in the Morning, when the French were drawn up in Battle-aray, that there was a necessity of engaging. The States Ar∣my consisted of about 25000 Men, in regard the Spanish Forces and others who should have reinforced them, were not yet come up; so that the Prince could not make above 2 Lines that extended from Fleuri to St. Arnaud. The French Army was above 40000 strong, Luxemberg having drawn a great Number out of the Frontier Garrisons, and having been rein∣forced 3 days before, by a Detachment of the Marquess de Boufflers, consisting of 18 Batallions, 45 Squadrons, and the flying Camp commanded by the Count de Gournay. The Prince indeed had some Notice of this Conjunction, but it was very uncertain; and some say, the Governour of Namur gave no∣tice of it by a Letter, but that it was not to be believed upon
any good Grounds. However it were, the Fight being re∣solved upon, the Command of the Right Wing was assigned to the Prince of Nassau, General of the Horse, accompanied by Lieutenant-General d' Huby, a Spaniard, and the Prince of Birkenfield, with his Brigadiers, the Prince of Nassau, Gover∣nour of Friezland, and Mareschal de Camp, and the Lieute∣nant-Generals d' Alva, and Webbenum had the Charge of the Left Wing, and the main Battle. Some Horse also before the Fight-began, were sent to line the Right Wing of the Army, which lay in a good Post; but whether none were sent to line the Left, or that they who were commanded thither, did not do their Duty, they did not perceive that the Enemy slipped several Troops behind a rising-Ground and a small Wood next the Sambre, who posted themselves behind the 2d Line of the Left Wing, which constrained them to face about, and turn their Backs to the Line; whereby being much weakened, some Batallions of the Right Wing were sent to secure their Flank, and assist to keep their Ground; Which was no sooner observed by the Duke of Luxemburg, but he said to the Duke of Main, who was then next him, Do you see what the Enemies are doing? I foretel they will be beaten. In short, the Left Wing was attack'd at the same time in Front, Rear, and Flank; the 1st Line, from which, as has been said, one Batal∣lion was taken to reinforce the 2d, after they had fought some time, were forced to give Ground. Whereupon the Enemy, who knew how to make use of that Opportunity, ad∣vanced to the 2d, to fall upon their Rear: Now that Line was already advanced to make head against the Cavalry which they had before them, and which they had routed, and drove back in disorder upon the French Infantry; But the French had 3 Lines, so that no sooner was one over-turned, but fresh Batallions renewed the Fight, and with more ease repelled the Dutch, quite tired with the Brunts they had already sustained. Prince Waldeck perceiving the Left Wing in that Condition, and that the Horse, weary of such hot Service, had for the most part given Ground, sent to their Relief the Horse of the 2d Line of the Right Wing, from whence the Foot had been already drawn for the same Reason. While this was doing on that side, the 1st Line of the Right Wing was also engaged with the Enemy, and had bravely routed them several times; and General du Puy who charged them in Flank, had gained 10 of their Cannon; But the Enemy having 3 Lines on that side also, and being continually re∣lieved by fresh Numbers, the Dutch Cavalry were dispersed and broke to that Degree, that the whole Body could never be rallied again. However, the Count of Flodorp got toge∣ther about a 1000 or 1200 about an hours riding from the Camp, and brought them on again, but then it was too late, for that the Infantry were retreated.
But however Matters went with the Dutch Cavalry in this Action, they have had the Misfortune to be esteemed ever since, the worse Horse among the Confederates; And cer∣tainly, if they had behaved themselves as well as the Infan∣try did upon this Occasion, I think, there had been no room left to doubt of their attaining a compleat Victory; For it may be truly said, without any Exaggeration, That never Foot performed greater Wonders; for after they were for∣saken by the Horse, they alone sustained the Charges of the French Cavalry and Infantry both, being charged in Front, Flank and Rear at the same time, and yet could not be broken: They let the Enemies Squadrons approach within Pistol-shot of them, and then let fly with such an unconcern'd and steddy Aim, that the whole Squadron together seemed to sink into the Ground at once, hardly 30 of the whole Number getting off; and this Course they so accustomed themselves to observe, that at length they laughed at their Enemies, crying out, Let them come on, we will give them their Belly full. The French on the other side were so dasht with the Execution done upon them, that they fled as soon as they saw them but once present their Musquets, nor durst they any more come near them, but suffered them to re∣treat in good Order, without ever offering to pursue them; Which made the Duke of Luxemberg say, That they had out∣done the Spanish Infantry at the Battle of Rocroy; Where, notwithstanding, the Spaniards performed Wonders; Ad∣ding withal, That it was for Prince Waldeck to remember the French Horse, and for himself never to forget the Dutch Infan∣try: But what-ever some have said in Justification of the Dutch Horse, the Deputies of the States General, when they took a View of the Army at Hawn, to see the Damage they had sustained, seemed to be of another Opinion; for as they went from Company to Company in every Regiment, they gave every Foot Soldier a Piece to the Value of 3 Franks, as a Reward of their Bravery; but gave the Horse nothing at all, as being accused of faling in their Duty. This Battle was very bloody on both sides, the Dutch themselves owning they lost 4600 Men upon the Place, a great many wounded, and near 3000 taken Prisoners, besides part of their Cannon, which they needed not to have done, had not the Waggoners cut their Harness to facilitate their Flight; And yet of them the Garrison of Charleroy brought off 25 Pieces, and 3 of the Enemies two days after. The most remarkable Persons among the slain, were the Prince of Saxon Masquerg, the Count of Stirum, one of the young Counts of Nassau, the Baron de Heide, and several Colonels, Captains, and inferiour Officers: And however Prince Wal∣deck might have been mistaken as to his Intelligence, con∣cerning
the Constitution of the French Forces before the Fight, yet 'tis certain he did all that could be expected from a General of his Age, and so unweildy as he was, during the Battel, and retreated that Evening with the rest of the Army in very good Order to Nivell, and next day to Brux∣ells, as the Duke of Luxemberg did to Villain, and from thence to the Place, where the Prince encamped before at Pieton, having put all the Country round about under Contribution; which besides the Honour of a Victory, was some amends for the many Men he lost in the Battel, some computing them to 12000 slain, wounded, and made Prisoners; though themselves would never own nothing near the Number. But what Inequality soever there was in the strength of the Armies when they engaged, or their Losses thereupon, the States recruited theirs with admirable Celerity, by se∣veral Detachments drawn out of their Garrisons, and other∣wise; and Count Tilly General of the Troops of Liege joined them on the 22d of July, with near 10000 Men of that Bi∣shoprick, and Brandenburgers, and some Hollanders. Prince Waldeck therefore finding himself so numerously re-inforced, decamped from Diephen, where he had been ever since the Battel; And having advanced as far as Walswavre, he was there joined by the Elector of Brandenburg with all his For∣ces; by which Conjunction the Army being deemed to be near 55000 strong, they moved on to Genappe, and so to Bois Seignior Isaac; The Duke of Luxemberg re-inforced his Army also on his side, and yet not trusting to his Numbers took care to fortifie his Camp, so as not to be forced to fight: So that there was no farther Action on Flanders-side this Cam∣paign, and therefore we will see how things have gone in Germany. Though the Emperor towards the latter end of the last Year,Arch-duke Joseph cho∣sen King of the Romans. was very urgent with the Protestant Electors to meet at Ausburg, and not only sent Envoys to importune them, but writ to them with his own Hand, yet he could not bring them to: However, the Electoral Colledge met together with the Envoys of those that were absent, to whom the Em∣peror delivered himself in a most excellent Speech upon the Occasion, for which they were Assembled, which consisted of 3 Principal Heads: The first was the Security of the Em∣pire against the Designs of France; Then the Necessity there was of choosing a King of the Romans; And lastly, he ear∣nestly recommended unto them to cast their Eyes upon Arch-Duke Joseph his Son, and King of Hungary, for advancing him to that Dignity: In short, what care soever was taken to provide for the Security of the first, they proved pretty unanimous in the Choice of the last, as supposing, and no doubt it was so, there could be no one better method to be
taken for obviating the Designs of France upon the Empire, than to invest a Prince of the Austrian Family with that Dig∣nity, which was always given out the Dauphin gaped after, or his Father for him. And therefore Arch-Duke Joseph was chosen King of the Romans, Jan. 24th, and crowned the 25th following, to the no small Satisfaction of the Emperor, and most of the Empire, as it was a Disappointment to France, who has still more Enemies coming upon her: For the Memoir which the Duke of Lorrain presented to the Diet at Ratisbone, towards the close of the preceding Year, about his being restored to his Dutchy, was now attended by a Manifesto from the same Prince, where he declared War against France, and set down his Reasons for it; Declaring how unjust it was in Lewis XIV. to detain his Territories from him, under vain Pretences; Promised to himself to enter Lorrain the following Summer, at the Head of 40000 Men; and exhorted all his Subjects to shake off the Yoke of France, and all the Gentry to come and join with him, and assist him to regain his ancient Patrimony, under the Penalty of being degraded of their Nobility, and deprived of all their Privi∣ledges: But alas! brave Man, he never lived to attempt, what he might propose to himself to effect the following Campaign: For as he was upon the Road to Vienna, he was seized with a Quinzy in a small Village named Wells, about 4 Miles from Lintz, which took from him the Use of his Lungs, and his speech in a short time, so that he was forced to write down part of his Confession: And perceiving him∣self near his End, he wrote a Letter to the Emperor; wherein,The death of the D. of Lorrain. after he had testified his Sorrow for not being longer able to serve him, he recommended his Wife, and all his Family to his Imperial Care. Then wrote another to the Queen his Lady, to comfort her for her Loss; Which two Letters he gave to his Confessor, with Orders to deliver them immediately after his Death. After this, the Impost∣hume that was in his Throat bursting within-side stifled him, so that he expired in the Arms of his Confessor, the 18th of April, in the Evening. The Death of this great Man could not but allay two different Passions in the Courts of Vienna and Versailles, since the one had alike Reason to be sorrowful as the other had to rejoyce before the News came; for there were mighty Jollities in the Imperial Court at this time for the Marriage of the Princess Dorothea Sophia of Neuburg, with the Prince of Parma; Whereas in France they were putting on their mournful Weeds for the Death of the Dauphiness, who de∣parted this Life within a Day or two of the Duke of Lor∣rain; but that did not retard the Dauphine her Husband's Journey into Germany, for he set out the 17th of the next
Month from Versailles, after he had been shut up with the King for several Hours in his Closet, and received his In∣structions, on the 28th arrived at Strasburg, and from thence went to Landau where the French Army lay, that was to act on that side. The Command of the Imperial Army on the other hand,The Cam∣paign in Germany. was given, now the Duke of Lorrain is dead, to the Elector of Bavaria, with whom at last joined a good Body of Saxons, headed by the Elector himself, with his two Sons, who held a Conference at Eppinghen, together with the Field-Mares∣challs, Caprara, and Serini; after which there were very great Expectations, the principal Part of the Army would have fallen upon Hunningen, which perhaps might take its rise from a Story, whether true or false I know not, of Ge∣neral Souches, who commanded part of the Army on Hun∣ningen-side, his going to attend the Duke of Bavaria at this time, and from him Incognito to Basil, where he would not suffer the Magistrates to pay him the Honours due to his Character, because he would not have his Journey make a noise in the World; And that in his Passage he had view∣ed and examined the Fortress of Hunninghen, of which he took a Draught, and from thence privately returned to the Army. But however it was, there was nothing put in Exe∣cution on that side; nor indeed any where else of any mo∣ment; For the Imperial Army having encamped for some time in the Marquisate of Baden-Durlack, all Men were sur∣prized, that instead of continuing their March towards the upper Rhine, they fell down of a sudden towards Mentz, the Elector of Saxony at the same time, being posted near Phillipsburg, and General Dunwall Commanding the flying Army toward the Garrison of Fort Lovis, and General Zou∣ches at his former Post: Of which motions the Dauphine was no sooner informed, but he passed the Rhine at Fort Lovis, to maintain his Army in the Enemy's Country, and that in Battle-array, as expecting some Opposition in his March, though he had none. Aug. 16th, he encamped in the Plain of Strotbeffon, having the Mountains on one side, the Rhine on the other, and a large Morass before him, be∣ing 40000 strong, and in Expectation of considerable Re-in∣forcements: With this he designed to have taken some orts that opened a Passage into Wirtemburg, a Province that had not yet been ransacked by the Army, and consequently would afford abundant Subsistance for his Men; But the Elector of Bavaria would not give him leisure to put that Project in Ex∣ecution; and therefore without losing of time he returned back with long Marches; and joining the Saxons, the two Electors marched directly towards the Enemy, but all that ever they could do, could not engage the Dauphine to fight;
who as industriously, by hard Marches and Stratagems, de∣clined a Battle, as they every way sought it: And the rather in that they were superiour to him in Forces, upon his sending away a Detachment of 12000 Men towards the Mosselle, to op∣pose the Designs of the Lunenburgers and Hessians, who were got near Coblentz, with a purpose to pass the Rhine, and so fall into the Arch-bishoprick of Treves, and expell the French out of that Country: Thus unactively, or at least without any memorable Action, ended the Campaign on the Ger∣man-side, and now we shall take a step into Catalonia, and see whether they have shewed any more Vigour there. The beginning of the Year was attended with an Insurre∣ction in that Country,The Insur∣rection of the Catalins. that wrought no small trouble both to the Vice-Roy, and the Court of Spain. The Pretence was, that the Spaniards kept too great a Number of Troops in that Province, and gave them Reason to fear they might be invaded more and more in their Priviledges, of which they were very Jealous, since the usual Impositions were hardly tollerable; and the manner of the Revolt was thus: Two wealthy Country-men had Credit enough to draw to∣gether about a 1000 more, and with that Body they stopped up all the Avenues to Barcelona (where the Duke d? Villa Hermsa the Vice-Roy resided) seized upon 4 Troops of Horse that ay in the Villages round about, and committed some Spoil: But the Duke ' Villa Hermosa had no sooner sent out a Party of the Garrison of Barcelona against them, than they fled to the Mountains, and from thence in a short time after sent to beg Pardon of the Vice-Roy, which was granted them; and all things thereupon were concluded to have been intirely appeased: But they were greatly mistaken in the matter; for the Sedition was only raked up in the Ashes; the Rebels had shewed themselves too soon, in regard the French who were to have seconded them, were not within reach to do it;The Frech prevail in Catalnia. So that the Catalins kept fair for a time till they had As∣surance of Assistance and Protection from France, when they threw of their Masks, acted more daringly than before, and increased in Numbers every day: So that the Spaniards were obliged, besides the Forces that Province had, which were not sufficient, to send for more out of Navarre, to suppress them, by which they were reduced to great Necessity, that tho' the Duke de Noailles posted with all Expedition to Per∣pignan, and used all the Industry imaginable to draw his Army together, yet they had before in a manner dwindled into nothing; and he found little other benefit of their Re∣volt, than the Advantage of being before-hand with the Spa∣niards in the Field (as he was the Year before, when he took Campredon from them, which spent them that whole Cam∣paign in the retaking of it, though they could not prevent
the Demolishing thereof) by which means he had the Op∣portunity to take San Juan Ahassus, a small Fort 2 Leagues beyond Campredon, and 6 from Gironne, which incouraged him to go on, and so making himself Master of divers small Castles that gave him Annoyance, he advanced as far as Foulen, about 4 small Leagues from Girone, which he also took in, and then turned his thoughts upon Gironne; But finding himself not strong enough to attack the City; yet being desirous to take advantage of the slowness of the Spa∣niards, he left Gironne npon the left hand, and advanced near the City of Vich, maintaining his Soldiers at the ex∣pence of the Catalins, and destroying all he could not make use of. But I'll warrant you, you are in an amazement what was become of the Spaniards; must we say they were idle all this while? By no means: For you must know, that by the Month of Aug. they had got between 10 and 12000 Men together, with which the Duke de Villa Hermosa march'd towards the Enemy, to call them to an account for all the Ravage they had committed, but they did not think fit at this time to abide the trial of a Battle, and therefore hast∣ned to retire by the way of Rousillon, which they did effe∣ctually, and with which ended that mighty Campaign: The Court of Spain being more taken up with the Jollities, oc∣casioned by the King's Marriage with the Princess of Neu∣burg, than with the Cares and Fatigues of a Campaign, for which of late Years they have shewed no great Sto∣mach. And now it will be time to say something of the Affairs of Italy, since the Flames of War began to kindle here this Year: You have heard before how the Duke of Savoy threw off the Neutrality, and closed in at length with the Confede∣rates; and that thereupon the Emperor had ordered divers Troops to succour him, but there was no depending for the present upon them, who were so remote, and the Enemy so near; And therefore the Duke making up what Force he could, and joyning himself with the Milanese Troops, made up an Army very near as strong as the French; yet they thought it not proper, after several Councils of War, to go in quest of the Enemy: The Duke indeed was impatient of Battle, being not able to endure the Enemy in the midst of his Territories, and therefore continually testified his Im∣patience thereof; But the Count de Lovignier, who com∣manded the Spanish Troops, was continually laying before him, That Mounsieur Catinat could not receive Supplies, but with great difficulty; and that his Army-wasted every Day, by Desertion, or Diseases; Whereas the Duke's Army in∣creased with new Re-inforcements every Month, and wanted for nothing, and therefore a little Patience would produce
assured Victory. Thus Matters stood when Monsieur Cati∣nat, being sensible of the Fault he had committed, in re∣moving from that place which afforded him means to repass the River Po, and Forage on the other side of it, used his ut∣most Endeavours to make himself Master of it a second time, but he must have some Blows for it; For when the Duke of Savoy understood his Design, and that the Forces which he he had posted upon the Banks of the Po were not able to stop the Enemy, he resolved to decamp with his Army to observe the Motions and Attempts of the French: And therefore quitting the Neighbourhood of Turin, June 17th, he en∣camp'd at Calalarga, which is over-against Montcallier,, not a∣bove half a League from the Enemy, the Po being between both Armies. Here the Duke lay for some days; and after several Coun∣cils of War, it was at last resolved to attack the Enemies Rear, thereby to hinder their Communication with Pignerol, from whence they had their Provision, in case they staid at Mons, where they then lay encamp'd: Wherefore the Duke July 17th, decam'd from Catalarga, and encamped about 3 quarters of a League from the Enemy; And the next day the French decamped also by break of day, and by 9 ap∣pear'd a Body of 400 Horse about a quarter of a League from the Army, which obliged the Duke to draw up his Army in Battel-aray. But Monsieur Catinat had no other Design, in making his Horse advance, than to secure the March of the rest of his Forces, which moved on to encamp on the River Pitana; yet he sent in the mean time a consi∣derable Party to make themselves Masters of Carignan, but by accident there was a Party of the Piedmont-Army posted there, which being seconded by the Vaudois and the Coun∣try People, prevented the Enemy from coming into the Town. The Duke of Savoy also on his part, considering the Ad∣vantageousness of the Post, and being fearful lest the French should make a second Attempt next Morning, he sent 3 Re∣giments of Foot, and 5 Squadrons of Horse to re-inforce the Town, commanded by the Marquiss of Pianezze, who ar∣rived there the next Morning an hour before day; and he had hardly possess'd all the Posts with his Men, before a De∣tachment which he ordered to post themselves upon a Bridge close by Carignan, over which the Enemy was to pass, met the Van-guard of the French, consisting of 3000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, who were advancing in order to make them∣selves Masters of Carignan, and who charged the Piedmontois with such a vigorous Resolution, that the Marquess de Pian∣ezze was forced to sustain the Party with fresh Supplies. In the mean time the Duke, who foresaw what would come to
pass, had ordered 2 Batallians of Foot of the Left Wing of his Army, and nearest to Carignan, to go to the Relief of the Marquess of Pianezze, with the Count de Louvigniez, and the Marquess of Parelle at the Head of them, who, by the time that they were come within a Mile of Carignan, found the Fight was begun. Whereupon the Marquiss de la Parelle entred the Town with one of the Batallions, while the Count de Louvigniez posted the other in an advantageous Place.The French repulsed at Carignan. The Duke in the mean time, had drawn up his Ar∣my in Battalia, and was advancing towards Carignan, with an Intention to give the Enemy Battel, in case they continued their Resolutions to make themselves Masters of the Post. The Marquess of Parelle had arrived just in the nick of time, as the Piedmontois had quitted the Bridge; but finding them∣selves re-inforced, they resumed Courage again; which (when the French perceived the whole Army coming down upon them) made them retire in some Confusion, after they had lost Monsieur de Savon, a very good Officer, with a considerable number of Soldiers. The Fight being thus end∣ed, there were all the necessary Orders given for the Preser∣vation and Fortifying of that Post; and then the Duke en∣camped very near the Enemy. This Repulse of the French at Carignan,The Vaudo rot the French. was followed by a more considerable Blow on the side of the Vallies of Pied∣mont, where the Vaudois joining with the French Exiles, were resolved to beat the Enemy out of the Vallies and the City of Lucern, of which they had at the beginning made them∣selves Masters. To this purpose, having on the 18th of Aug. joined themselves with the Marquess de Parelle, the Duke of Savoy's Lieutenant-General, who had about 3000 of the Piedmont-Militia with him, at the Place called Babian; they resolved upon the Enterprize, tho' de Parelle was called away to the Duke of Savoy's Army presently, and most of the Militia disbanded: Wherefore Monsieur de Loches, after having viewed the Posture of the Enemy, whom he found to be above 3000 Foot, and 6 Squadrons of Horse and Dra∣goons commanded by Monsieur de Feuquieres, and were en∣camped within the Walls of Lucern, which they had demo∣lished Breast-high, and had posted 400 Men in the ort of St. Michael, that was hard by; he detached 200 Vaudois un∣der 3 Captains that had with them 3 Granadiers, who pas∣sed by Lucern over the old Bridge, and joined the Troops of Monsieur Arnauld (the Minister that lay at Bad) command∣ed by the Chevalier Verulli, sent to them by the Duke of Savoy; But upon the appearance of the Enemies Cavalry on the side of Babian, Monsieur de Lohes retired as fast as he could, after he had given Orders to Aruld to give notice of what had passed. In the mean time, while the Vaudois
appeared almost at the same time under a rising-Ground, having the Enemy in Front, ready to receive them, and Ve∣rulli being re-inforced with 200 Men more, they set upon the Enemy altogether, and after half an hours Dispute, car∣ried St. Michael's Fort, after they had been once beaten out of it; and not contenting themselves with that Advantage, they pursued the Enemy within Carbine-shot of Lucern, and then retreated into the Wood, which put the Enemy into a Non-plus, that they durst not attack that handful of Men, for fear of an Ambuscade. In the mean time a Messenger was dispatch'd to the Marquess of Parelle, who coming next Morning to Babian with 800 of the Milita, he advanced to∣wards Lucern, which the Enemy had quitted after they had burnt some Houses; But the Marquess met their main Body at the joining of the two ways that came from Lucern, and put the Militia at first to Skirmish with them, but they were soon scared with seeing some of their number fall, and fled as far as the Bridge; yet the Vaudois coming up, fell briskly upon the Enemy, and forced them to retire in Dis∣order, having killed several, both Officers and Soldiers, and pursued them with a great deal of Fury, tho' they made se∣veral Halts, till they came to Briqueras, where putting their Horse and Dragoons to cover the Town, and lodging their Infantry in the Castle, they made a stand: But the Vaudois attacking the Town in 3 several Places, and the Ca∣stle in 5, they killed a great number of French Officers that obstinately defended the Place, and at last carried both Town and Castle, and pursued the Enemy as far as Mission, and all this with the Loss only of 48 Soldiers, and about 9 Officers; but that of the French amounted to at least 1200, and a∣mong them several considerable Officers, besides the wound∣ed, which were carried on 17 Waggons to Pignerol. However,Caours ta∣ken by Cati∣nat. The Battel of Salusses. the Duke of Savoy, or his Vaudois might be elated with this Success, Monsieur Catinat gave them quickly Occasion to change their Note; For after he had taken Ca∣vours, a small Town upon the left of Pignerol, he advanced Aug. 17th towards the City of Salusses; of whose march when when the Duke of Savoy was informed, he passed the Po with his Army, as well to secure the Place, as to offer the Ene∣my Battel, which the other did not decline: For upon the 18th Catinat gave the Signal, and by 11 in the Morning or∣dered the Italians to be attack'd by the way of the Morass, which he had caused to be sounded before, and found firm enough to bear his Men; So that the Duke's Left Wing not expecting to be attack'd in Flank, the Morass being to the Left of them, made not such a stout Resistance, as they might have done, had they been forewarned. However, they killed several of the Enemy, but at length the Cavalry
began to give way, being maul'd both with the firings of a Body of Reserve, and with the great Cannon that plaid di∣rectly upon them. But the Right Wing stood firm till 3 in the Afternoon, when being not able to bear the whole brunt of the Enemies fire, they were constrained to betake them∣selves to flight; and several of them thinking to facilitate it by taking the Po in their way, were drowned. The Duke himself retired with part of his Troops to Carignan, to com∣pute his Loss, which the Enemy affirmed to be 4000 slain out-right, 11 great Guns, good store of Baggage, some Co∣lours, and a considerable quantity of Ammunition taken; and that themselves had not above an 150 killed, and about 100 wounded. This Account, tho' it be not altogether pro∣bable, yet the Advantage every way was the French's, past all doubt; and what was intended to have been saved by the Duke of Savoy in hazarding this Battle, was the Consequence of Catinat's Victory, who the very next day possessed him∣self of Salusses, as he did soon after of Savillana, a large Ci∣ty 15 Miles from the former, Villa Franca, and divers other Places; and then march'd with his Army to Raiconoggi, with a Design to set upon the Duke of Savoy's Men that were re∣tired to Carignan, after their Defeat, or at least to make him∣self Master of Carmagnoli: But the Duke not finding himself in a state to abide his coming, retreated to Monclair to re∣cruit his Army, and to wait for the German Troops that were coming to his Assistance, after he had put 4000 Men into Ca∣rignan, and secured Carmagnola. The Germans, or at least part of them, some time after joyned the Duke; with which Reinforcement, besides some Milanese Troops, being near 20000 strong, he decamp'd on the 16th of Sept. from Mon∣clair, and advanced towards Catinat, who also having been strengthened with some Regiments from France, was not at all startled at his Approach, but stood his Ground, while Monsieur St. Ruth was reducing Tartantasia and Morienna, with all Savoy, excepting Montmelian, under the Obedience of the French King, whose Cities swore Allegiance to him, and whereof Monsieur St. Ruth, for his good Services, was made Governour, with an annual Pension (as 'twas said) of 40000 Livres. And as the French Forces had in a manner, made a com∣pleat Conquest of the Dutchy of Savoy this Season, you have already an account how far a Progress they have made in Piedmont, the most valuable part of the Duke's Dominions; and now you will hear of what was more afflicting to his Royal Highness, than any one thing that perhaps befel him since the Rupture. Suza is a City very considerable for its Situa∣tion, as being that which opens a Passage out of the Dau∣phinate into Piedmont, whenever the French should think it re∣quisite;
For every time the Kings of France design'd a War in Italy, they always coveted to be Masters of that Post. Now Catinat had had an Eye upon it for some time, and made some secret Paces towards accomplishing his Design, which yet he could not carry so covertly, but that the Duke had no∣tice of it; so that he did all he could to prevent the misfor∣tune: To this purpose he sent away the Count of Lovigniez with 6 Batallions of Foot and some Horse, to secure the Place: Of which Monsieur Catinat being advertised, he did not take the ordinary Road, but hasted towards the Mountains, march∣ing his Men with wonderful Application and Celerity for 6 Days together without Intermission. This Motion of his, when the Duke heard of, he mistakingly thought the Siege of Suza had been a feign'd business,Suza be∣sieged and taken by the French. but that the true Design of the French was to give him Battle; and therefore sent Or∣ders to Lovigniez to leave Suza, and forthwith to joyn him with all his Forces. This was no sooner done, but the French immediately begirt the City, where there was only 6 or 700 Men in Garrison under the Count de Lande, who seeing no likelihood to defend himself in such a weak Post with such an inconsiderable Force against a numerous Army, or rather being of a base and dastardly Nature, made shew of putting himself first in a Posture of Resistance, but presently after sur∣rendred the City upon Terms of marching out with Arms, Baggage, and 3 Cannon, and to be convey'd to the Gates of Turin. With this Action the Campaign ended in Italy, for Catinat divided his Army thereupon, sending one part of them into Winter-Quarters in Savoy, and the other into Provence. But while the Duke of Savoy was struggling in this manner with his adverse Fortune at home, without its having been in the Power of his new Allies, the Germans and Spaniards hi∣therto to bear him up under the Weight that oppress'd him, he bethinks himself of making Application to some other o the Confederates, and therefore first sends the Count de l Tour his Envoy into Holland, who was kindly received by the States, and promised some Support (tho' this was the first that ever came from a Duke of Savoy to them ever since they had been a State) and had Orders from thence to go into England to congratulate the King and Queen's Accession to the Throne, (having done his main business with the King's Envoy before at the Hague) and delivered himself to the King in the following Terms, which I am the more inclined to tak notice of, because of something in consequence, and where you will have an Account in due place, that quite contradict what in substance is contained herein.
SIR, HIS Royal Highness congratulates Your Majesties glorious Access to the Crown, due to your Birth, merited by your Ver∣tue, and maintain'd by your Valour. Providence ordain'd it for your sacred Head, for the Accomplishment of Heavens Designs from all Eternity; that Providence, which after long forbearance, raises up chosen Instruments at length to suppress Violence, and pro∣tect Justice. The wonderful beginnings of your Reign are assured Presages of the Blessings which Heaven is preparing for the Inte∣grity of your Intentions, which have no other Aim than to restore this flourishing Kingdom to that Grandeur which it anciently en∣joyed; and to break off those Chains, under the Weight of which all Europe at present groans. This magnanimous Design, so worthy the Hero of our Age, soon fill'd his Royal Highness with unspeaka∣ble Joy, tho' he were constrain'd to keep it undisclosed for a time in the privacies of his Heart; and if afterwards he could not forbear to let it break forth, the Obligation of that Happiness is due to your Majesty who has at length inspir'd him with Hopes of that Liberty, after so many Years of Servitude. My Words, and the Treaty I have already sign'd at the Hague with your Majesties Envoy, but faintly express my Master's passio∣nate desire to unite himself to your Majesty by an inviolable Devo∣tion to your Service. The Honour which he has of being one that appertains to your Majesty, has knit the first Knot of this Vnion▪ and the Protection you grant him with so much Generosity, has brought it to the Perfection of being indissolvable. These are the sincere Sentiments of his Royal Highness, with which I dare not presume to intermix any thing of my own. For how ardent soever my Zeal may be, how profound soever my Veneration of your Ma∣jesties Glory, I know not how better to express it, than by the Silence of Respect and Admiration. Here we shall leave the Duke of Savoy and his Affairs, both Military and Civil, for the present, and inspect a little into those of Hungary, and that part of the World, where you will see quite another face of things than last Year; For the Prince of Baden had then no more glorious Successes against the Infidels, through the whole Course of the Campaign, than the Turks and Tartars had now over the Christians; and of which we shall immediately enter upon the Particulars. This Year had not long been begun, when the Tartars who had no rea∣son to be afraid of Poland, with a Body of about 10000 Men, fell into Albania, ravaging and destroying all before them with Fire and Sword; And tho' the Duke of Holstein, who commanded there, was aware of his Unability to cope with such a numerous Army of fresh Men, and therefore kept upon the defensive part; yet he could not guard himself so well, but that the Tartars, seconded by the Turks, and some of the
Country Militia, who perfectly well understood all the By∣ways, surprized him at last; So that notwithstanding all the vigorous Resistance the Christians made, yet being over∣powered by numbers, they were almost every Man of them cut off, and hardly any left to carry the News of that fatal Destruction, it being computed that no less than 5000 Germans perished that Day: And if such fatal Beginnings have many times the like or worse Consequences; it was so in this Case also: For the Turks and Tartars, flush'd with this Success, soon after made themselves Masters of Casaneck, a Place of great Importance. All this made the Duke of Holstein, who lay sick at the same time, order several other Places to be quitted. But the Tartars not content to have defeated the Christians in Servia, entred into Wallachia, to the number of 16000 Men, purposing to drive the Imperialists quite out of the Province: Of whose march when General Heusler was informed, and finding himself not strong enough to resist so considerable a Body, he retreated into Transilvania, quitting the City of Buchorest to the Tartars, where he lay in Garrison with some Regiments; and no sooner had he left it, but the Infidels, pursuant to their usual Celerity, arrived, and pre∣sently overrun the Country with their accustomed Ravage. These Advantages seemed to be an Obstacle to the Peace, of which (tho' the Turkish Embassadors, had been sent away from Vienna, yet they were still at Comorra) there were some Hopes hitherto it should have succeeded; but now it began to grow desperate. Yet to comfort the Imperialists somewhat for those forementioned unexpected Losses, the Garrison of Ca∣nissa, a Town in Lower-Hungary, which had been blockaded with a Body of 6000 Hungarians, and 2000 Heydukes, June 30. 1688. and continued so till the 13th of Apr. this year, was at length reduced to that Extremity for want of Provi∣sions,Canisia sur∣renred. and despair of being relieved by the Turks, that it ca∣pitulated; and when the Articles were ratified by the Empe∣ror, the Keys of the Gates hanging upon a Chain of Gold, were delivered to the Count de Budiani, by a Turk, saying, I herewith consign into your Hands the strongest Fortress in the Ot∣toman Empire. So he took possession of it, and found therein great store of large Artillery, and some with old German In∣scriptions on. But whether this might elate the Minds of the Imperial Court, so as to take it for a good Omen of a success∣ful Campaign, I know not; Yet this is certain, that the Prince of Baden had other Sentiments of things than many others were aware of; and never any Prince shewed more Dilatori∣ness and Reluctancy to head an Army than he did this Year: Much a-do they had to get him out of Bohemia; and he was a whole Month at Vienna before he went away for the Army, which was on the 1st of Aug. He had no sooner got to the
Camp, but he found things in such a Posture that he long be∣fore was apprehensive of; For he understood that the Grand-Visier with 30000 Foot,Nissa and Widin be∣sieged by the Turks. and 10000 Horse had laid Siege to Nissa, that the Serasquier with about 10000 Men had besieged Widin, and that Count Teckeley, with an Army of between 15 and 16000 Turks, Tartars and Hungarian Malecontents had en∣tred to take possession of Transilvania, which was given him by the Grand Seignior, now Prince Abaffi was dead. The Prince, not knowing how to remedy these complicated Evils, had no other way than to advise with them about him, which of them it was most proper for him to attempt to set to rights; And therefore in a Council of War held with his Officers, after a long Debate, it was at last concluded, That it were better to hazard the Loss of Widin and Nissa, than of all Tran∣silvania, and consequently, that without endeavouring to suc∣cour either of those Places, it behoved them to flie to the Relief of that Province; and therefore the Army march'd back again by the way of Semendria, in order to move that way. But long before the Prince could reach thither,Teckely pos∣sesses him∣self of Tran∣silvania, and routs Heu∣ster. or indeed before he set forward, Teckely had in a manner possess'd him∣self of all the Country; For while General Hensler posted him∣self in the Passes from Wallachia into Transilvania, with a Bo∣dy of about 4000 Men, to secure the Principality on that side, those Troops of Wallachia, who were with Teckely, and perfectly knew the Ways, being about a 1000 in number, passed thro' the Woods and Mountains, where they could not ride, but were forced to lead their Horses by the Bridles, and fell briskly upon the Imperialists in the Rear, when at the same time Teckely with his Turks, Tartars and Malecontents at∣tack'd them in the Front. Upon this the Militia of Tran∣silvania, who were with Heusler; whether out of Cowardise or Treachery, made no Resistance, but fled immediately in∣to the Woods; so that the Imperialists alone were forced to sustain the whole Fury of the Enemy. The Fight was both long and bloody, but at last the Multitude prevailed, one part of the Imperialists being slain, and the other taken Prisoners, there not being above 300 as were so happy to escape their Death or Servitude. Most of the Officers were slain, the Marquess of Doria was taken Prisoner by the Tartars; and while the brave General Heusler was re∣tiring to Cronstradt, his Horse was killed under him, and himself taken Prisoner by Count Teckely, who sent him some time after some Bread and Wine, and ordered the Mes∣senger to tell him withal, That if the Emperor had not dispoiled him of his Estate, he might have been able to have sent him a bet∣ter Present. And not long after he sent him another Com∣pliment; That he would endeavour to render his Imprisonment the
more easie, by the Care he should take of his good Vsage; and then gave him leave to inform his Wife of his Condition, by an Express which he sent her. In the mean time, Teckely, as a Mark of his signal Victory, sent a great Number of Colours, Kettle-Drums, and 2 lovely Horses to the Grand Seignior then at Adrianople, and summoned together the Petty Estates of Transilvania, who formally elected him to be their Prince, and then joyned some of their Forces to his, for his Assistance and the maintenance of his Right; which the Prince of Ba∣den on the Emperour's part is hastening to dispute with him, and so we at present shall leave him on his March, and see what is become of Nissa, Widin, and something of far more consequence than either of them. Count Guido of Staremberg,Nissa sur∣rendred. who was Governour of Nissa, after he had valiantly defended the Place, for a long time by making frequent Sallies upon the Turks; wherein he killed them a great many Men, seeing at length the Enemy lodged upon the Counterscarp, assembled the principal Officers of the Garrison to know their Opinion, what was best for him to do under such a difficult Conjuncture, especially since they found there were no hopes of relief now left; for the Grand-Visier to incline them to surrender, sent the Count word of the Defeat of the Imperialists by Teckely, and of the Prince of Baden's being forced to pass the Danube, to go and secure the Province of Transilvania; whereupon it was unanimously concluded that it was time to capitulate, least the Town should be taken by storm, to the ruine of 2500 Soldiers, that might be serviceable elsewhere. But that which altogether prevailed upon the Governour was his scarcity of Provisions, which would last but for a very few days: Whereupon a Par∣ley was beat, and the Articles concluded and signed the 8th of Sept. which were as honourable as could be desired, and by which they were to be convoy'd safe to Belgrade, but they were not so punctually performed as they ought to have been. For the Arnauts fell upon the last Battalion of the Garrison, and disarmed them. But upon complaint made hereof to the Grand-Visier, he caused 10 of the Officers to be put to death, and offered to pay for the Arms which they had taken, but said nothing of restoring them, and perhaps it was because he stood in need of them: But this was not all; for the Convoy that were to have conducted them as far as Belgrade, basely left them between Perachin and Jagodna, so that they were soon after set upon by a Body of Tartars, who yet were so warmly received, that above 40 of them were left dead up∣on the Place, and the rest scoured off as soon as they could, and at length Sept. 22d after having run many hazards, and suffered all kinds of hardships, arrived safely at Belgrade; where we leave some of them to meet with a worse Fate, and
return to the Garrison of Widin; who no sooner understood that Nissa had capitulated, but they resolved to do the like, and obtained almost the same Conditions but with this dif∣ference,Widin sur∣rendred. that these last were punctually observed, the Gar∣rison being carefully convoy'd to Orsowa: Though it was ge∣nerally talked then, that they deserved a less favourable Usage, seeing they held out but from the 25th to the 29th of Sept. which was but 4 days,Belgrade besieged by the Turks. although they were but 800 Men. But this was but playing at small Game in comparison to what was to follow, but the Grand-Visier after he had taken in Se∣mendria (whose Garrison being no more than 500 Germans, and 400 of the Country Militia, defended it for 4 days with extraordinary resolution against the whole Ottoman Army, and were at last every Man of them put to the Sword, save the Lieutenant that commanded, and some few other Officers) on the 1st of Oct. sate down before Belgrade: The Place had a good Garrison of above 6000 old German Soldiers, commanded by Count Aspremont, and was well provided with all sorts of Ammunition and Provisions; But the Breaches that had been made when it was taken 3 Years before by the E∣lector of Bavaria, were not fully repaired, so that they were forced to defend them with a double Rank of Pallisadoes. On the other hand the Grand-Visier, after he had ordered the foremost Regiments of his Van-guard to take their respective Posts, began his Approaches within Musket-shot, under the Covert of some ruined Houses, which the besieged had not taken care to level with the Ground: However, the Count fired so hotly upon them with his Cannon, and made such furious Sallies, that they were forced to draw a little further off. The Visier no whit discouraged herewith, ordered 3 At∣tacks to be made in the very same Place, where the Chri∣stians had done, when they besieged the Town before, and assaulted some advanced redoubts, where though they were repulsed 3 several times, yet they returned so vigorously, and in such great Numbers to the Charge, that they possest them∣selves of them at length, but with the loss of several thousands of Men. The following days they spent in carrying on their Approaches, and raising new Batteries, and on the 5th ad∣vanced to the very Pallisadoes, but the besieged fired so thick upon them with their Cannon, laden with Chain-shot and Cartouches, and at the same time made such a resolute Sally, that they constrained the Enemy to retreat with the loss of abundance of Men. The Imperialists hitherto had a free Communication on that side the Drave, and the Dunube; But the Turks making themselves Masters of the Island next to Or∣soway, brought up their Gallies and Galleasses to the very Banks of the Island; and so stopt them up that way. While
things continued in this Posture, and that the Garrison were full of hopes to tire out the Enemy by a long siege, especially having beaten them out of some Redoubts, and a Covert-way which the Turks had mastered before, an unforeseen Misfor∣tune dashed all their Hopes, and at the same time destroyed a great Number of the bravest Soldiers in Christendom; For a Bomb from the Turks unhappily lighting upon a great Tow∣er, where the Magazine of Powder lay, blew it up into the Air, killed about 1200 of the Garrison, and wounded a great many of the rest, made the whole City shake again, threw down the Walls in several Places, and ruined almost all the Houses: But this was not all, for the Fire took in other Ma∣gazines of Powder, whether treacherously or no, or whether, as it was rather believed, by the means of some Sparks, or Brands, that flew from the great Tower, so that the whole City was all on a blaze at once, which caused such a Confu∣sion, and Desolation in the Place, as cannot well be imagined; there being nothing to be seen but the sad Spectacle of dead or dying Men, and every body minding more the saving of his own Life, than the Defence of the Town. The Turks perceiving the Effects which their Bombs had produced,The Turks take Bel∣grade by storm. and encouraged by the Accident, were so wise as not to let slip the opportunity, so that upon the 8th of Oct. they made a new Assault, though they had opened never a Breach in the City-wall, but made use of those that had been made in the former Siege, and some other Breaches which the fatal Accident had newly wrought; And in this Assault they fought so furiously, that though they were repulsed se∣veral times, yet at length they over-powered the Besieged with their Numbers, and cut them to pieces, not sparing any what∣soever; 6000 gallant Men perished by this disastrous Mis∣fortune; And only the Duke of Croy, who had a little before got into the Town, the Count of Aspremont, the Count de Archinto, and some other Officers with about 600 more saved themselves through the Fishers-gate, and got over the Danube in Saicks, but yet not without the Addition of one Disaster more, which is inevitable at such times: For one of the Sa∣icks being over-laden with the Crowd of those who shifted for their Lives, sunk to the Bottom, and the Multitude met with that death in the Water, which they thought to avoid by Land. Thus was the famous City of Belgrade retaken by the Turks in 8 Days space, Oct. 18th this Year, which the Elector of Bavaria had taken by storm, on the 16th of Sept. 1688, af∣ter a Months siege, and of which we have given you account before in its proper Place. The Turkish Army rested some days after this important Conquest to refresh them;Esseck be∣sieged by the Turks in vain. and then though the Season was far advanced, being willing to strike while the Iron was hot,
they advanced from thence, and crossing all over the Coun∣try from Belgrade to Esseck, appeared before that Place the 30th of the same Month. The Duke of Croy, and the Count of Staremburgh had got thither a little before, after they had withdrawn the Garrisons out of Walcovar, and other Posts through which the Enemy was to march, and did their ut∣most to put Esseck into a Posture of Defence; though they had little hopes, considering the ill State of the Place, to hold it any long time. This the Grand-Visier knew well enough, and therefore he only sent 6000 Men, under the Command of Mustapha, Bassa of Bosnia to take it in, who was so confident of Success in the Enterprize, that he attackt the Place without any Care of Military Discipline, and ne∣ver taking any Pains to make Lines of Circumvallation, or Contravallation. The Duke of Croy who commanded in the Place, upon the 3d of Nov. at Night rode out to view the Enemy's Works, and went so near that a Musket-bullet pas∣sed through his Hat without doing him any other Mischief, and there finding the Turks remiss upon their Guard, and wrought in great security, he resolved to hazard a Sally, and made choice of the day following for it, which was his Birth-day; Wherefore he sallied out with 200 Foot, and a 1000 Horse, and succeeded so well, that he killed above 300 of the Enemy, filled up a good part of their Trenches, and took 5 Colours, which he sent to the Emperor: But neither this, nor the Scarcity of Provisions, nor yet the Report of Relief coming to the Besieged, could totally discourage the Turks; and therefore on the 5th of Nov. they fired all day long with an extraordinary fury, resolving upon a Storm, as soon as they had made a Breach wide enough to enter by: The Duke of Croy on the other side, seeing the Be∣siegers so active; and being informed by some Prisoners, that the Enemy made the more hast to carry the Place, be∣cause of the Intelligence they had that General Battiani was coming forwards with Relief, he be-thought himself, in order to confirm them in that Belief, of this Stratagem. He ordered in the Night-time 400 Horse to sally out with all their Trumpets and Kettle-drums, giving them Orders to divide themselves into 2 Bodies, and so to sound louder and louder gradually, to make the Enemy believe it was the Relief that was expected; which Device, tho' none of the cunningest, succeeded so well, and struck such a Terror up∣on the Turks, that they drew off and retreated so precipi∣tously, that they left behind all their Cannon and heavy Baggage. As soon as the Duke was assured they were quite gone off, for they fled in the Night, he distributed 4000 Florins among the Garrison, ordered every Soldier a Pound of Meat a day, and a Measure of Wine, caused the Enemy's
Cannon to be secured, and their Works demolished; and af∣ter having given all the necessary Orders for the Security of the Place, he posted himself to Vienna, to give the Empe∣ror an account of the good News, who failed not to shew him all the Testimonies of his Favour, that so important a Piece of Service did deserve: Thus Esseck was delivered out of the Hands of the Turks, by an Event as contrary to most Mens Expectations, as Belgrade fell under their Power. But as if the Turks had not made a sufficient Progress this Cam∣paign already, and for a Compensation to their Disappoint∣ment at Esseck; they made themselves Masters of Lippa in upper Hungary, and found means to re-inforce the Garrisons of Great Waradin, and Themeswaer, with fresh Men, and all sorts of Provisions, which was so much the more unfortu∣nate to the Imperialists, since those two considerable Towns had been block'd up so long by them, that they must infallibly have been surrendred unto them before another Campaign. And now give me leave to say, That hardly any Story can parallel such two different Campaigns as this and the last have proved to the Ottomans, who the preceding Year were in a fair way of losing all they had in Europe; for the Im∣perialists carried before them as far as Nissa, and Widin; and by any thing that appear'd to the contrary, might have gone even to the Gates of Adrianople, had the Season lasted, for the Country is all open that way; where∣as the Turks this Year, besides the re-taking of what they had lost then beyond Belgrade, even recovered that impor∣tant Place also, and advanced afterwards, as it were, into the very Heart of Hungary, besides what Tekeley their Vas∣sal did in Transilvania, whose Dominion however was not long-lived there, as we are just now going to relate unto you. We left the Prince of Baden upon his march towards that Principality,P. of Baden reduced Translvania and expels Tekeley. he passed the Iron-gate without any Opposition, and advanced the 12th of Sept. as far as Wesot, where he staid two days till the Baggage came up, which could not follow so fast by reason of the Mountains, and narrow Lanes through which they were to pass, the 24th he set forward for Hatzech, and encamped the 25th at Nelans and Beras near the River Stretta: The day following he marched through the Plain of Hunniad to that of Maros, not far from Szalvaras, where they met with a small Party of Tekeley's Men, who were scouting abroad to inform themselves of the March of the Imperial Army, of which, some they killed, and took others Prisoners; and having rested the 2 next days, they continued their March towards Alba Julia, or Weissemburgh. But what-ever methods Tekeley might take to get Intelligence, the Prince of Baden managed his Business with so much Pru∣dence, Celerity and Secrecy, that Tekeley found himself invi∣roned
by the Imperial Army, before he was well aware of it; So that he could go neither forward, nor to the left, nor right, without venturing a Battle; which, because he did not find it convenient to do, he laid hold on the only Course that remained for him to take, and so safely retreated to Moldavia: But he was in so much haste, that he left part of his Baggage behind him, and had between 2 and 300 of his Rear-guard cut off; So that the Prince cleared all Transil∣vania in a trice. Then having taken all the Care imaginable to secure the Passes from Moldavia and Wallachia, and those which were next the Danube, to the end they might be free from the Fears of any new Invasion; He separted the Army on the 1st of Nov. leaving a good Body in the Province it self, under the Command of General Veterani, who had the Duke of Hanover and the Baron de Pace under him, and with the rest march'd himself towards Clausemburg, and from thence soon after posted to Vienna, where he was much ex∣pected, and received abundance of Honour for his great Ser∣vices; where we shall now leave him, and take a step in∣to Poland, tho' we had in a manner as good stay at home; For there passed there in the whole Course of this year, ve∣ry little of any Consideration. The Tartars and Turks both made home-Attempts to draw the King to disunite from the Confederacy,The King of Poland tempted to make Peace with the Turks. and to that end both of them sent their respective Envoys to him; who, tho' they made a meen of being desirous of a general Peace, yet all their Solicitation tended to induce the King to make up a particular one for himself, which yet at last did not suc∣ceed, contrary to their own, and most Mens Expectations. But while the Tartarian Envoy was carrying on his Negotia∣tion,The Tartars harrass Po∣land. as aforesaid, in order to a Peace, their Forces commit∣ted a thousand Disorders upon the Frontiers, harassing and burning all before them, and carrying into Captivity all that had not the foresight to make their Escape; and entring further into Pocutia and Volhinia with their usual Ravages al∣so. This so nettled the Polish Forces, who had the first Intel∣ligence thereof, that they mustered in great haste together out of their Winter-Quarters where they lay, (tho' in truth their business that time of the year, which was now Sum∣mer, had been to be in the Field) pursued and over-took the Enemy, and charged them so vigorously, that they were forced to repass the Borysthenes; where when they had got, they rallied again upon a rising Ground; and from whence perceiving the Poles marching in disorder, without any care of Discipline, they immediately repassed the same. River, and attacking the Christians, before they could rally them∣selves, they cut 17 Companies in pieces; and this gave them another opportunity of making a second Inroad into the
Country, and that farther than they had done before, and you may be sure with no less Ravage. This rouzed up the Polish Courage once more;The Poles unactive in the Prosecu∣cution of the War. wherefore there was a Muster ordered to be made of the Polish Army, which was found to a∣mount to 5000 Horse, 2400 Dragoons, and 12000 Foot. Af∣ter this, about the 1st of Sept. they passed over the Neister above Weynits, with their Artillery, and march'd directly towards Moldavia, the most Eastern Part of the ancient Dacia, confining upon Poland, where the King making himself Ma∣ster of Sockow, the Metropolis of that Province, seated on the South-side of the River Sereth, he furnished it with a Garrison of 800 Men under the Command of General Har∣stal, and all manner of necessary Provisions for 6 Months, purchased with the Money which the Pope had sent him. When they had so done, they march'd homewards without any further Attempt this Campaign, where we will leave them, and see whether the Venetians have not been more active than they this Season against the common Enemy of Christianity. Towards the beginning of the year the Doge arrived at Venice, where he entred in great Triumph, re∣signed up his General's Truncheon, and was received by the People with the loudest Acclamations of Joy, and Wishes for his Prosperity, as the Defender of their Country; which yet received some Damp from the ill News brought in that Conjuncture from the Levant, of the Turks having put fresh Relief into Napoli di Malvasia, which we told you they had block'd up last year, as fearing now the Blockade would prove as unsuccessful as the Siege then had done. But the Republick not being discouraged herewith, not only order∣ed the Blockade to be reinforced, but prepared all things in a readiness to begin the Campaign betimes; and so much the rather, because of the Assistance of 300000 Livres the Pope their Country-man gave them at this time for the Expen∣ces of War; and that they believed they should meet but with little Opposition on that side, since the Turks would be forced to imploy the main of their Forces in Hungary, and only be upon the defensive in the Morea. In pursuance of this Resolution and Preparations, the Sieur Cornaro, now Captain-General of the Venetian Forces, caused the lower Town of Napoli di Malvasia to be attack'd,Neapli di Malvasia be∣sieged by the Veneti∣ans and ta∣ken. where he met with very stout Resistance, tho' the Garrison were now re∣duced to about 300 Men, who killed at least 200 of the Christians upon this Occasion, before they could carry the Place, which yet raised their Hopes mightily that it would contribute to the speedy surrendring of the Body of the Town, especially when they found by an intercepted Letter of the Commander, that he had not Provision for above 15 days; and in effect so it came to pass: For notwithstand∣ing
all the Efforts the Turks made to relieve it, it was actu∣ally delivered to General Cornaro on the 12th of Aug. and with it the entire Conquest of the Morea, compleated by the Republick, for whose use were found in it 73 Pieces of Cannon, and above 130 Christian-Slaves hereby recovered their Liberty. This matter, tho' slowly, yet being thus happily termi∣nated, the General thought fit to imploy the remainder of the fair Season in undertaking some further considerable En∣terprize; and understanding that the Turks were apprehen∣sive, the Republick might now turn her Arms upon Negro∣pont, upon the Fortifications of which he found they had for that reason bestowed great Labour and Diligence, and stored the same with all manner of Provisions, he resolved to bend his Course another way. To that purpose, leaving 1200 Horse, and a considerable Body of Foot near the Isthmus of Corinth, to prevent the Turks that were in Achaia, from en∣tring again by Land into the Morea, and 12 Men of War to obstruct their Descents by Sea, he march'd directly to at∣tack Vallona, a well-fortify'd City, almost over against Otranto, anciently Tarentum in Italy, and at one of the ends of the Gulph of Venice, seated in the Kingdom of Macedon, directly opposite to that City, and was now the Seat of the Basha of Epirus: It had a strong Fortress belonging to it, and a very spacious Harbour, at the Mouth whereof stood two Castles, that commanded it. For the putting of this Enterprize in Execution, the General had with him 19 Men of War, 3 Fire-ships, 22 Gallies, 24 Galeots, and a great number of Ships of Burden▪ and his Army consisted of 9000 Foot, 800 Horse, 3000 Vo∣lunteers, 1200 of the Pope's Foot, and 1600 of the Infantry of Maltha; besides which, the General of Dalmatia was or∣dered to send a Body of the Venetian Forces into that Pro∣vince to join him. But the General met with so many un∣expected Interruptions, and with such contrary Winds in this Expedition, that he could not come before the Town be∣fore the 12th of Sept. which Delays gave the Turks so much leisure to provide for their Defence, that they had got toge∣ther 7000 Foot, and 1500 Horse to dispute their landing, one part of their Infantry being posted upon the adjacent Hills, and the rest entrenched upon the Shoar; to which they had also added several new Works and Entrenchments within the Suburbs of the Town. But all these Difficulties hindred not the Venetians from attempting to land the day following, which was the 13th; to which end General Cor∣naro having fixed every one to his Post, and now preparing to land, 1500 of the Inhabitants of that Country, with whom they had held Intelligence, and who had in the mean time taken care to provide themselves with Arms and Am∣munition,
appeared in good order near to a Place called Ayna Fredda, and began a brisk Skirmish with the Turks, which made the General make the more haste to get on Shoar, tho' the Sea ran very high (which was no small Ob∣struction to their Descent) and tho' the Turks, notwithstand∣ing the continual firing made from the Ships and Gallies up∣on them, disputed the Ground with them for 2 Hours: But then the Sieur Gennelines, General of the Maltese Battallion, was the first with his Men that set foot on Shoar, being soon followed by Signior Mohkeenchi, and Seignior Bonaven∣tura with the Pope's Forces. The Turks finding they could no longer well resist, betook themselves to slight, and the Christians landed altogether without any Impediment, with the loss only of 6 Men killed, and 16 wounded; but it was more considerable on the Turkish side. This being done, the Command of the Army was thus assign'd; General Gaudagni was to lead the main Battel with the Auxilaries; the Sergeant of Battalia, Spaar, had the Command of the Right Wing, and Lieutenant General Barri commanded the Left, while Reperta; Sergeant of Battalia, with his Detachment, was appointed to command the second Line; the Proveditor-General Gremani being in the mean time left at his Liberty to be up and down where 'twas most necessa∣ry. They set forward in this Order, and General Spaar po∣sted himself on the rising Grounds, after he had repulsed the Turks, and advanced on the 14th, while the Cavalry, who was yet on board, landed, Raperta being at the same time posted near the Sea for the Security of the Convoys. The Turks also appear'd then,Vallona be∣sieged by the Vene∣tians. but were so bravely attack'd by General Spaar, that he drove them back to a great Town about a League from Vallona, seated upon an Hill, and de∣fended by a Castle which they took by Storm, and entrench∣ed themselves about the Castle; when General Cornaro com∣ing up in the Evening, ordered a Battery to be raised, on which were planted 2 great Guns, and 6 of a lesser Size, from which the same Night they began to play upon the Castle; Upon this a Resolution was also taken to fall upon the Turks that were encamp'd before Vallona, to the number of 6000 Fot, and 1500 Horse; General Spaar, with 4000 Foot, and 400 Horse, being ordered for that Service. But the Turks had no sooner seen the Venetians advance, than that they fled, and were pursued so among the Woods, that they were utterly scattered. In the mean while the Christians fell upon another Town, where the Turks had entrench'd themselves, and quickly ma∣ster'd it (notwithstanding the vigorous Resistance of the Ene∣my, who fired upon the Venetians from the Houses and For∣tress without ceasing) whereby they depriv'd the Town of
all Communication between the Turks and them. General Cornaro was present in this Action, and performed all that could have been expected from a Person of Courage, and an experienced Captain, who had his Hat shot off with a Flight of a Cannon-bullet; But Sergeant Barri was slain with a Musket-ball as he was going to view a Post; as were some others of note killed and wounded. The next Night they began to mine the Castle, tho' the Enemy fired very despe∣rately upon them till Morning; But upon the first appear∣ance of day, they hung out a white Flag, and desired to ca∣pitulate: To which end they let down from their Walls two of their Officers, who were brought to the General, and demanded at first very ridiculous Terms; but they were brought to, and at length it was agreed they should march out with their Arms and Baggage; which they did accordingly, being about 550 Soldiers, and near 5000 others, who were all conducted to their Army. But tho' this was happily ter∣minated, the main Work was still to do. Wherefore from hence they returned before Vallona, which appear'd to be a Figure with 8 Angles, environed with a Moat and Couter∣scarp, and having a Tower in the middle, furnished with 20 Pieces of Cannon, besides 60 more that were planted round the Town. Not far from hence stood a small Wood of Olive-Trees, with a small Burrough, wherein were 6 Churches be∣longing to the Turks, Greeks and Jews, which they soon made themselves Masters of, carrying their Approaches on at the same time before Vallona, which they battered with their Cannon from the Ships, and Bombs from the Polanders. They summoned the Commander of the Town to surrender, who demanded time till the next day, which was the 18th of Sept. when a Feleuca being sent to summon the Basha a second time, she found the Gates open,Vallona de∣serted by the Turks. the Turks having quitted the place in the Night, and of which General Cornaro took pos∣session that day. Here, after he had given the necessary Or∣ders for the Security of his new Conquests, he re-imbark'd the Army, with a design to make himself Master of Durazzo, but falling sick by the way, and the Winds proving contrary, he returned again on the 29th of Sept. to Vallona, where af∣ter 9 days Sickness, that brave Man died on the first of Oct. which the Council of Venice was no sooner informed of, but they appointed Seignior Mocenigo to succeed him. The Venetians did not only prove Victorious by Land this Campaign,The Vene∣tians beat the Turks at Sea. but they had considerable Success also by Sea; For General Delphino having Orders to Convoy the Garrison of Napoli di Malvasia to Cande, with the Squadron which was under his Command, did upon the 18th of Aug. join with Captain Contarini, who had 12 Men of War, and 2 Fire∣ships with him; and on the 29th of the same Month being
arrived not far from Andros, he understood that the Admi∣ral Basha who had with him 27 Gallies, 32 Ships, and 6 Galleons, was resolved to attack him; wherefore he put out to Sea, and being on the 7th of Sept. got near to Cape St. Mary, he had sight of the Ottoman Fleet, which was about 20 Miles from thence. In the Night he got the Weather-gage of the Enemy, and the next day being the 8th, bore directly upon the Enemy, who, on their part, also endeavoured to gain the Wind, and to come close up to him. Delphino took the Van-guard himself, and gave the Rear-guard to Conta∣rini; and he was hardly come up in his single Ship with 12 Turks Men of War, but they were becalm'd; Whereupon the Turkish Gallies fell into the Rear, and the Captains of Constantinople, Algier, Tunis, and Tripoli bore up the Van, and seemed as if they intended to board the Christians; But the Venetian Gallies fired so thick upon them, that seve∣ral of the Enemies Vessels were shot through and through. General Delphino had his Hand shot off in the Action, which yet did not hinder him to keep in his Station till the Fight was over, two other Vessels bearing up at the same time to relieve him. The Turks hereupon would needs fall upon the Rear-guard, but were so warmly received by Contarini there also, that they were forced to fly much damnified, to Mete∣lin, from whence they made all the sail they could to Focis; which General Delphino seeing, and being not able to over∣take them, he steered away for the Morea, now entirely conquered by the Venetian Arms; and which they took all the Care imaginable the remainder of this Season to secure, by fortifying the Isthmus of Corinth, the only way there was left to attack them. Having run through the several Actions of this Season,Attempts made by France for a Peace with the Empe∣ror. and in the close of the preceding one told you of the Death of one Pope, and the Election of another, we are now briefly to acquaint you, That the differences about the Franchises and other things done by the French Clergy, as was esteem∣ed, in Prejudice of the Holy See, were this Year amicably composed between the two Courts of France and Rome: The French King, making in a manner, all the Concessions, on his Part, to effect it; and the old Dad, to make him some Recompence for it, laid a Design to reconcile the Emperor and France. The Republick of Venice, as well for their own Interest, as to please his Holiness, joyfully (as was said) concurring with is Holiness in his pious Project. But all his Endeavours could never bring the Emperor to relin∣quish the Alliances he had so solemnly entred into, as well for his own, as the rest of Europe's Security; And so his Project fell to the Ground: And therefore I have no more
to do now, than to recapitulate with a learned Pen, and in his own Words and Order, the several Remarkables, or at least,The Re∣markables of this Year. the most notable of them that have happened within this annual Revolution. The preceding Year, says he, was re∣markable for five Considerable Battels fought, as it were, in a huddle; in every one of which there was something worth par∣ticular Observation. The first in Transilvania, where Treachery contributed as much to the Victory, as Valour: One in Flanders, wherein Surprize had a great Share: One upon the Sea, where only Number got the Advantage: One in Ireland, where For∣tune declared in Favour of true Merit and Prowess: And one in Savoy, where want of good Intelligence, and the small Expe∣rience of the Vanquished, gave the Fortune of the day to the Victors. We are not here to forget the Death of the Elector Pala∣tine in a good old Age, nor of the Princess of Portugal of a lingring Sickness, which in all probability terminated some Disputes that in time might have arisen concerning the Suc∣cession of the Crown of that Kingdom. The beginning of this Year is remarkable for the famous Congress of the Confederates that was held at the Hague; where, besides a greater Number of illustrious Per∣sons that appear'd there more than upon any other Occa∣sion,The Con∣gress at the Hague. they were adorned with the Presence not only of two Electors, and other Foreign Princes of Germany, but that of William III. King of England, whom the Rigour of the Season, and the great Dangers of a tempestuous Sea, but a more dangerous Icy Shoar, could not hinder from going thi∣ther to further the great Deliverance of Europe, that he had so gloriously begun, and already so far carried on (as we have in some measure traced in our foregoing Discourse) and where he represented to the Congress,The King's Speech to the Con∣gress. That the Imminent Dangers they found themselves in, sufficiently discovered the Er∣rors that had been committed, so as there was no other Admoni∣tion than that, necessary for their taking more just and better Mea∣sures; That it was not a time to deliberate, but to act in the Cir∣cumstances they were in; That the Enemy was Master of all the chief Fortnesses that were the Barrier of the common Liberty; And that he would very quickly possess himself of the rest, if a Spirit of Division, Slowness, and particular Interest continued among them; That every one ought to remain perswaded, that their respective particular Interests were comprized in the general One; That the Enemies Forces were very strong, and that they would carry things like a Torrent before them; And that it was in vain to oppose Complaints and fruitless Clamours, or unprofi∣table Protestations against Vnjustice; That it was neither the Re∣solutions of a Barren Dyet, nor the Hopes of some Men of For∣tune, arising from frivolous Foundations, but Soldiers, strong
Armies, and a prompt and sincere Vnion between all the Forces of the Allies that must do; and these too must be brought to op∣pose them without any delay, if they would put a stop to the Enemies Conquests, and snatch out of his Hands the Liberty of Europe, which was already held by him under a heavy Yoke. That as for himself, he protested to them, That he would nei∣ther spare his Credit, Forces, nor Person, to concur with them in so just and necessary a Design; And that he would come in the Spring at the Head of his Troops faithfully to make good his Royal Word, which he had so solemnly passed unto them. But tho' this heartening Speech,The Resolu∣tion of the Congress. and generous Resolution in the King, brought every one of the Assembly to promise for his own part to furnish as many Troops as he could, to oppose the Enemy, and to concur unanimously in the Exe∣cution of so noble a Design, this did not discourage France: For the French King thinking the only way he could take, to divert the Counsels that had been taken against him, was, if it were possible, to strike a Damp into the Confederates, and by some signal Action, thro' the Terror of his Name and his Arms, to keep back the rest of Europe, that was not yet engaged against him; he divided his Armies into two for∣midable Bodies; and early, even in March, the first of them advanced both by Sea and Land, and came to the Territo∣ries of Savoy, with a Resolution to besiege Nice, of which we shall give you a short Account, before we come to the other Body in Flanders. The Army under Monsieur Catinat in∣vested the Place on the 13th of the said Month, from whence he sent 3 Batallions to Villa Franca, who basely surrendred af∣ter the firing of only one Cannon, which killed a Captain; but the Castle which is seated upon a Rock, and environed with good Bastions,Nice besig∣ed and ta∣ken. and a large Moat, stood it out yet; and so the French invested it on the side of the Sea, but could carry on no more than a simple Battery raised of great Bar∣rels, Faggots, and Sacks of Earth, upon which they planted their Mortars and great Guns: This the Garrison observing, after two days, march'd out with all Ensigns of Honour, and the disciplined Soldiers were sent by Sea to Final. On the 24th the Fort of St. Auspice was also given up without making any Resistance, and upon the same Condition as Villa Franca. Another Fort called the Montalban did the same thing, after they had stood a Battery of one day, which now gave the French an Opportuny to attack Nice in earnest; wherein they met with a greater facility than they expected. For on the 26th the Consuls of the City sent their Deputies to Catinat, who agreed with him at a certain Hour, and up∣on certain Signals to receive the French King's Men into the City, without the Governour's Privity; of which the other having notice, attempted to make himself Master of
one of the Gates, to prevent the Design. But the Citizens being resolved to secure their Houses from the Ravage of the Bombs, had taken their Measures, and being got to their Arms, fired upon the Governour's Detatchments; and then having given their signal, the French entred, and took pos∣session of the City about Mid-night, having promised the Deputies before, that the City should enjoy all their Privileges and Immunities as formerly. The Governour of the Castle finding how things went, endeavoured to fire the City-Ma∣gazine, but failed; and being threatned that if he shot a∣gainst the City, the Garrison should have no Quarter; that did not deter him, but that he plaid all the 27th day up∣on the chief Governour's House, and one of the Convents; But the French made 3 Attacks upon the Castle, which were carried on with great Vigour, notwithstanding the badness of the Way; and on the 30th, one of their Magazines set fire to a Magazine of Powder therein, which spread it self in a Moment through all the Castle, and blew up not only a good part of it, but killed above 600 of the Garrison, and about 50 of the Besiegers in their Trenches by the Pieces of Stone and Timber which the Powder carried thither; So that the Governour, what with this sad Disaster, and that the French had made themselves now Masters of the cover∣ed Way and second Inclosure, thought it high time to capi∣tulate, which he did on the 2d of April; and after all, got honourable Terms. But the French did not conceive what was doing in Sa∣voy to be enough; and therefore to give the Confederates a convincing Proof of their readiness, not only to answer, but to attack them in a most sensible Part; They invested the strong City of Mons,The siege of Mons. on the 15th of March, before which Place, the French King (notwithstanding all the disswasions, as was said of Madam de Maintenon, to the contrary) arri∣ved the 21st in Person, and took a round about the Town, being accompanied by the Dauphin, the Duke of Orleans, and the Duke de Chartres. Whereupon next day the Trenches were begun for draining the Morass, and other Trenches were begun to divert the Course of the Troville, and to force it to run on the other side: By the 26th the Trenches were advanced within an 150 Paces on each side, and the same day the Mill of Hion was attack'd with the redoubt that cover∣ed it, and after a double Repulse was carried by the French by main Force, with considerable Loss on each side: But things did not end here, for the French having raised large Batteries, with at least 25 Mortars, they play'd both from the one and the other incessantly, and made terrible havock in the Town, and notwithstanding the stout Resistance of the Besieged, the French were advanced so far, by the 1st
of Apr. as to be able to fill up the Moat of the Horn-work, and attack it, which began about 3 in the Afternoon (and after the Loss of a great many Men) began their lodgement thereupon; But when it was almost half done, the besieged headed by some of their stoutest Officers, attempted to beat them off, and in effect constrained the Granadeers, and the Guards to give way; yet at last the Besiegers, with the loss of about 200 Men, regained their Post, and push'd on the Siege with great Vigour, and the rather, because they heard the King of England was come to Vilvord with the Confe∣derate Army, with an intention when the Forces came up to attempt to relieve Mons, though indeed there was little likelihood of it, all things being so unprovided as they were, and not so much as the necessary Carriages ready for the Expedition; which neglect was laid to the Charge of the Marquess de Castinaga, Governour of the Spanish Netherlands. But the Besiegers had not for all that by the 8th of Apr. and probably could not in several days longer, have made such a Progress in the Siege, as necessitated the Garrison to capi∣tulate, tho' the last beat a Parley that very day: But the Truth of the whole Matter was, That they could not do well otherwise; For first the Monks and Ecclesiasticks, who were known to be Friends to France, and by their instigation the Burghers of the Town, were importunate with the Go∣vernour to capitulate, and upon his refusal threatned to open the Gates to the Enemy, and deliver both him and his Garrison into the Besiegers Hands;Mons sur∣rendred. so that in short, not∣withstanding all his, and Colonel Fagel's efforts to the con∣trary, in perswading the Citizens to be quiet, all would not do, but capitulate he must; and in pursuance of the Agree∣ment, the Garrison march'd out on the 10th of Apr. and left the French in an intire Possession of that important Fortress, and the Confederates to look about, and consider where this would terminate. But at present we shall leave them, and tell you, that King William hereupon re-passing the Seas, gave all the necessary Orders imaginable for having all things ready for the intire Reduction of Ireland, which was left to the Management of Lieutenant General Ginkle, while His Majesty himself was to return again into Flanders, to head the Confederate Armies, and try the Issue of the Campaign, whether it would be carried on and ended on that side as it began, but of this more by and by; we being resolved at present to prosecute the Irish Wars, even to the final Event of them. After both Armies in that Country had gone into their Winter-Quarters,The War in Ireland. as we have already related in the pre∣ceding Year; they remained on either side pretty quiet for  time but tho' several Designs were brewing by
each Party against the other; there hapned nothing of any great moment between them, and the most considerable Mis∣chief done to the English was by the wicked Rapperies of the Country, and the Native Irish not in Arms, both which the other were first or last sufficiently quit with; yet there was not such forwardness in either to take the Field, but that the Month of June came first,Baltymore surrendred to the Eng∣lish. when the initiating Work of the English proved to be the Siege of Baltymore, which was surrendred on the 9th of the said Month; and from whence after some days stay there, the Army march'd towards Athlone; and on the 19th very early in the Morn∣ing, the Van-guard marched from Ballyburn, and beat the Enemy from several out-Ditches, within the Walls of the English Town of Athlone, on this side the Shannon, and lodg∣ed themselves in the said Ditches: On the next day a Bat∣tery was raised, and a Council of War held, wherein it was resolved to storm the English Town, that the Irish pretend∣ed to defend, which was done accordingly; for tho' the Irish made considerable Resistance,The English Town of Athlone ta∣ken. yet the English went on, and kept firing till they got to the Breach that was made, which a French Lieutenant first mounted, throwing in his Granado, and firing his Piece, and ordering his Men to do the same, and with great Bravery incouraged his Party, tho' he lost his Life in the Action, and so the Town was taken, and abundance of the Enemy both killed and drowned in en∣deavouring to Escape. Then Batteries were planted against the Irish Town, which by the 22d in the Morning were finished, and the Cannon and Mortars began to play very briskly on the N. E. side of the Castle, where it was weakest, and continued to do so next day when the Tin-boats came up, and that a Prisoner who was taken gave an account, that 64 Men were in a Mill upon the Bridge, which being fired by the English Granadoes, and those within not being able to quench it, nor get thence, they were all burnt to death, ex∣cept the Prisoner and one more who leaped into the Water; the 24th, was spent in raising more Batteries, one below and another above the Bridge, while a 3d was erected with∣out the Town-wall by the River-side, opposite to a Bastion the Irish had made on the other side of the River: And at the same time they were contriving Methods to pass the River, but all this while the Irish were not idle in raising Batteries, and making other necessary Preparations for their Defence, which did but heighten the Courage of the Eng∣lish, who by the 26th fired from 7 Batteries upon the Ene∣mies Works, and did great Execution; and the Design they once had of passing the Shannon at a Ford towards Lanes∣borough, being frustrate, the General resolved to try what he could in forcing a way through Athlone, and therefore labour∣ed
hard to gain the Bridge, but found this to be very difficult Work. However, on the 27th in the Evening the English burnt the Breast-work the Irish had made on the other side of the broken Arch, with throwing in their Granadoes, which, being made of Wood, presently set them on fire; and the next Morning, which was the 28th, the English had laid their Beams over, and partly planked them, which a Party of the Enemy attempting to ruine, were every Man slain. But all this did not discourage another Party of 10 Men to set about the same Work, which they bravely effected by throwing down the Planks and Beams, maugre all the firing and Skill of the Eng∣lish, but they all also perished, except 2; which made the Ge∣neral resolve to carry on the Work by a close Gallery on the Bridge, and designed to pass the Shannon next day, but they met with such Opposition, and especially by having their Gal∣lery burnt by the Irish, that the further Prosecution of the At∣tack was deferred for that day, which was the 29th. But on the 30th a Council of War being held, it was stifly debated, whether it were more adviseable to make another Attempt, or to draw off; And though there appeared very great Rea∣sons for the latter, yet the Duke of Wirtemburg, the Major-Ge∣nerals Mackay, Talmash, Ruvigny, and Teautau urged, That no brave Action could be attempted without Hazzard; That the Attempt was probable, and profered themselves to be the first that should attempt to force the Enemies Works in their own Persons, particularly Talmash, which they happily per∣formed accordingly: For the Detatchment drawn out the day before, was ordered still to be in a readiness; And the General gave command they should be all brought down by 6, the usual time of relieving the Guards, that the Enemy might not suspect the Design; which indeed they did not, by the Information given the General by 2 Officers that Morning that deserted from the Enemy: So that all things being now ready, the Conjuncture favourable, and the Sig∣nal given,The English pass the Shannon. Captain Sandys and two Lieutenants lead the first Party of 60 Granadiers all in Armour, and 20 a-brest, se∣conded by another good Body, with an amazing Resolution, and took the Ford that was a little to the left of the Bridge, against a Bastion of the Enemies, the Stream thereof being very rapid and deep; At which time also the English, great and small Shot, began to play from their Batteries and Works upon those of the Irish on the other side, who fired as thick as possibly they could upon our Men passing the River, that yet gallantly forced their-way through the Fire and Smoak, and having gained the other Bank, the rest laid Planks over the broken part of the Bridge, while others were laying the Bridge of Boats, whereby the English passed over so fast that in less than half an Hour they were Masters of the Town, and
of all the Trenches, besides one beyond the Town. For the Irish being amazed at the suddenness of the thing, and Reso∣lution of the English, quickly gave Ground, and retired to∣wards their Camp; Tho' a great many of them were killed in their Works,The Irish Town of Athlone taken. yet it was observable that the English, when they saw themselves really Masters of the Place, were not at all forward to kill those at their Mercy, tho' it was in a man∣ner in the heat of Action. But the Rubbish and Stuff beaten down by their Cannon, was more difficult to climb over; than a great part of the Enemies Works; which made the Sol∣diers curse and swear, even among the Bullets, and gave oc∣casion to that brave Man, and right Christian Soldier, Ma∣jor-General Mackay, to tell them, That they had more Reason to fall upon their Knees and thank God for the Victory; and that they were brave Men, and the best of Men, if they would swear less. The English were no sooner entred the River, but an Express was sent from the Town to Monsieur St. Ruth that comman∣ded the Irish Army and French Auxiliaries, who, upon the News, said, It was impossible for the English to pretend to take a Town, and he so near with an Army to succour it. But being very soon assured that the English were in actual Possession of the Place, he greatly lamented his Misfortune, and ordered several Detachments to beat them out again; but then he was sensible of a former Over-sight, in not demolishing those Fortifications of Athlone that were next his Camp; for now the English possess'd their own Works entirely against them∣selves: So that the more adviseable way he had now, was to decamp with his Army, which he did that very Night, and of whose Motion and Resolution General Ginkle had various Reports. However, he continued at Athlone till the 10th of July, when finding the Town now pretty well cleared, and Works raised for its necessary Defence, he march'd on with the Army, and the next day being the 11th, reach'd Balshanoe, encamping along the River Suck upon Roscommon-side, which is a very good Pass, and where the Irish might have given him a great deal of Trouble in gaining it: But they had found out a better Place, as will appear by this Posture, for they lay on the other side of Aghrim-Castle, three Miles beyond Balshanoe, and were extended from the Church of Kil∣commodon, on their Right, to a Place called Gourtnapori, about 2 Miles in length; on their Left ran a small Brook having steep Hills and little Boggs on each side; next to which was a large Red Bogg almost a Mile over, in the end whereof stood the Castle of Aghrim, commanding the way that lead to their Camp, passable for Horse no where, but just at the Castle, by reason of a small River, which running through a moist Ground, made the whole a Morass, which extended it
self along to the Enemies Right, where there was another Pass at Vrachree, having a rising-Ground on either side there∣of; the Irish Camp lying along the Ridge of an Hill, on the side of which stood 2 Danish Forts, about half a Mile's Di∣stance from the Bogg below, and this cut into a great many small inclosures, which the Irish had managed so as that they made a Communication from one to another, and lined all those very thick with small Shot. And in a word, the Enemy were so posted that they could not possibly have a better; which General Ginkle, upon viewing their Posture, and the Map given him of the Ground, was very sensible of. How∣ever, he ordered the Army to march towards them the next day, which Monsieur St. Ruth observing, and supposing by their Countenance they were resolved to attack him, he gave his Men all the Incouragement imaginable, ordering Pray∣ers and Masses to be said in all Parts of the Army; and the Report went, that the Irish were obliged by their Priests, to give no Quarter to any Soul living, but to pursue every Man to Destruction, they being assured of a most glorious Victory; and St. Ruth himself was said to have made a Speech to the Irish the day before the Battle, it being found after∣wards among his Secretary's Papers, who was killed in the Field, and containing in Substance, How successful and fortunate he had been in suppressing Heresie in France, and bringing over a vast Number of deluded Souls into the Bosom of the Mother-Church, that for that reason his Master had made choice of him be∣fore others to establish the Church in Ireland, on such a Foundation, that it should not thence-after be in the power of Hell or Hereticks to disturb it, and that the Depen∣dance of all good Catholicks was on their Courage to effect it. He confessed, things did not entirely answer his Expecta∣tions, since he came among them, but that still they were retrievable; That he was informed, the Prince of Orange's Heretical Army was resolved to give them Battle; That now or never was the time then for them to recover the lost Honours, Priviledges and Estates of their Ancestors; urging to them, they were no Mercenary Soldiers, their All lying at stake, and their work besides, to restore a pious King to his Throne, and more especially, to propagate the Holy Faith, and extirpate Heresie; and lastly to hearten them to stand firmly to it, he assured them of King James his loving and rewarding them, of Louis the Great, his protecting them, of himself to lead them on, of the Church to pray for them, of Saints and Angels to caress them; and in short, of their being made all Saints, and Holy Mary to lay them in her Bosom.
And now give me leave to be a little more particular in the Relation of this Battle of Aghrim, whereof we are just now going to speak,The Battle of Aghrim. and the rather, because it was beyond Con∣tradiction, one of the sharpest Fights that hapned during the whole Course of this War, and wherein the English Valour was exerted to the greatest degree of Glory imaginable. Sun∣day the 12th of July being come, the English Army was com∣manded to advance upon the Enemy; But the Morning prov∣ing foggy, they moved not, till it was about 12 a Clock, which was then done in as good Order as the Ground would admit; The General at the same time going out with a Par∣ty to view the Enemy, who perceiving some of their Scouts upon the Hills, he ordered a Party to beat them off, which they did, the Enemy retiring within half a Mile of their own Camp, and this gave the General an opportunity from an high Hill to the Right of the Enemy, to view their whole Army, posted as before described, and from thence he saw a ne∣cessity of gaining the Pass of Vrachree to the Right of the Irish, and where they had some Men posted. To this end, he sent a Danish Captain, with 16 Troopers to force it, but they did not succeed, so that the General ordered 200 of Cunningham's Dragoons to march to certain Ditches nigh the Ford to keep the Enemy from coming over, and in the mean time, the English Army march'd forward. By this time it was two of the Clock, and the General finding it necessary to have that Ford, and the other ways that lead to the Right of the Irish Army, as the most proper means to attack them, ordered Cunningham's Dragoons at the Ditch to advance toward a Par∣ty of the Enemy posted on the other side, who, thereupon, with another Body that sustained them, all retired behind a Hill nearer their Camp, where was posted a greater Body, who being assisted with other fresh Parties, obliged the Eng∣lish Dragoons to retreat; So that the General ordered Eppin∣ger's Dragoons to get between those Bodies and their Camp, but this was discovered by the Enemy, who had the Advan∣tage in pouring in so many Men upon the English, that they would still have been too hard for the Dragoons, had they not been seconded by the Earl of Portland's Horse, who behaved themselves here with great Bravery, tho' not without con∣siderable Loss. But what was at first only a Skirmish, had by this time engaged a considerable Body on both sides; yet the Enemy in a while retired, and this brought the Generals to∣gether to deliberate whether it were not best to defer the Battle till next Morning, which was agreed on so far, that their Tents were ordered to be sent for; but when they per∣ceived the Enemy to be in some Disorder by what had al∣ready hapned, they resolved not to delay the Attack, least the Enemy should march off in the Night, and so afford no
more Opportunities: Wherefore by the Advice of Major-General Mackay, a Person of great Judgment, and long Ex∣perience in the Art of War, it was agreed to prosecute the Battle on the Enemy's Right, thereby proposing to draw part of their Strength from Aghrim Castle, near unto which their main Body was posted; that so the Right Wing of the English might have the easier Passage over to attack their Left, and then the whole English Army might have the Op∣portunity to engage, which was otherwise impossible, and this Advice had its desired end. About half an Hour after 4 in the Afternoon, a Party of the English Left Wing moved to∣wards the Enemy, and by 5 the Battle began afresh. The Ditches were strongly guarded by Irish Musketeers, and their Horse advantageously posted to sustain them: And here the Irish behaved themselves like Men of another Nation, de∣fending their Posts with great Obstinacy, for they would not stir from one side, till the English put their Pieces over at the other, and then having Lines of Communication from one Ditch to another, they would presently post themselves and flank the English, which occasion'd a great firing on both sides, and continued on the Left almost an Hour and an half, before the Right Wing of the Army, and the Center bega to engage, except with their Cannon, which play'd all this while on both sides. In the mean time the English Army ad∣vanced in as good Order as they could; And now Major-General Mackay and the rest observing the Enemy draw of several Bodies of Horse and Foot from the Left and move to∣wards their Right, where our Men pressed them very hard; They laid hold of that Advantage, and ordered the Foot march over the Bog which fronted the Enemy's main Battle▪ The Regiments of Earl, Herbert, Creighton and Brewer going over at the narrowest Place, where the Hedges on the Ene∣my's side ran furthest into the Bog, they had Orders to marc to the lowest of the Ditches adjoyning to the side of the Bog and there to post themselves, till the Horse could come abou by Aghrim Castle, and sustain them; and till the other Foot had marched over the Bog below where it was broader, and were sustained by Foulk's and Brigadier Stewart's Regiments Earl's and the other 3 Regiments advanced over the Bog most of them passing up to the middle in Mud and Water and upon their near Approach to the Ditches, received th Enemy's Fire, but that did not hinder them to march on the Enemy's lowest Hedge, and to beat the Irish from thence who, however, did not retreat far, but posted themselves i the next Ditches, which the English seeing, and disdaining to suffer their Lodging so near them, they beat them from thenc also, and so from Hedge to Hedge, till they were got very near their main Body. But the Irish had so well order'd th
matter, that they had made an easie Passage for their Horse among all those Hedges and Ditches, by which means they poured in great Numbers both of Horse and Foot upon the English, which Colonel Earl observing, he encouraged his Men, by advancing before them, and saying, There was no way to come off, but to be Brave. Yet now being both flanked and fronted, besides being exposed to all the Enemy's Shot from the adjacent Ditches, the English were forced to quit their Ground, and retire to the Bog again, with the loss of a great many Men; and among others, the brave Colonels, Earl and Herbert, the former after twice taking and retaking got free at last, tho' not without being wounded; but the latter, as was said, was barbarously murthered, after Quar∣ter given by the Irish, when they saw he was also like to be rescued. While this was doing here, Colonel St. Johns, Colonel Tiffin, the Lord George Hambleton, the French in English Ser∣vice, and several other Regiments were marching over be∣low upon the Bog, while the Irish lay so close in their Ditches, that several were doubtful whether they had any Men at that Place or no: But no sooner were the French and the rest got within about 20 Yards of the Ditches, but the Irish fired most furiously upon them, which the other sustained with in∣trepidy, and still pressed forwards, tho' they could scarce see one another for Smoak. And now the Battle seemed so doubt∣ful for some time, that a By-stander would rather have given it on the Irish side, for they had driven the English Foot in the Center so far back, that they were almost got into a Line with the great Guns, planted near the Bog, which the Eng∣lish had no benefit of in that Conjuncture, because of the Mixture of the Irish with their own Men. You hear little all this while of Horse, but now we are to tell you, that Major-General Ruvigni's Regiment of French, and Sir John Lanier's being both posted on the Right, were afterwards part of them drawn to the Left, where they did very good Service, and the Right Wing of English Horse were in the mean time making the best of their way to suc∣cour the Foot; For they saw their Danger, and that indeed all was at hazard, because of the difficulty of the Pass, in pressing and tumbling over a very dangerous Place, and that among Showers of Bullets from a Body of the Enemy's Dra∣goons and Foot that were posted conveniently under a Covert-place by the Irish, to obstruct the others Passage. However the Horse bravely surmounting all these Difficulties, lodged themselves at last in a dry Ditch in the Throng of the Ene∣my's Shot from Aghrim Castle, and some old Walls and Hedges adjoyning; and it is reported, that St. Ruth seeing the English Horse draw that way, and beginning to scramble
over a place, where two could only go a Breast, and that not without great Difficulty, asked what they meant by it, and being answered, That they would certainly endeavour to pass there, and attack them on the Left, he was said to reply with an Oath, They are brave Fellows, it is pity they should be so exposed. However the Horse made good the Pass, and my Lord of Oxford's, Ruvigni's, Langston's and Bierly's Regiments, together with Levison's Dragoons, repulsed and beat the Ene∣my several times, making their Party good on that side, tho' not without Loss. But the English Foot all this while laboured under very great Disadvantage in the Center, which being observed by the brave Major-General Talmash, he hasted to their Relief with some fresh Men, and gave Orders to the broken Regiments to halt, and face about, which they did immediately, and bravely charged the Irish, who had advanced upon them to the Center of the Bog, killed above 300 of them, before they could retreat out of it, and then marched boldly up to their old Ground again, from whence they had been lately beaten. Major-General Mackay had at the same time fallen upon the Enemy with a good Body of Horse on their Left, while Major-General Ruvigni went along the side of the Bog, with another Party of Horse, who did very great Service, and bore all down before them; but then the Horse and Foot of the English Right and the Irish Left being mixed, there was nothing but a continued Fire, and a very hot Dis∣pute all along the Line, the Irish doing all they could to de∣fend their Ditches, and the English to beat them out from thence. But the thing was not doubtful much longer, for tho' Monsieur St. Ruth, when he saw the English Foot in the Center repulsed, in a great Extacy told them about him, That he would now beat the English Army to the Gates of Dublin, yet seeing the Horse press over towards the Castle, he order∣ed a Brigade of his own Horse to march up, then riding to one of his Batteries, and giving Orders to the Gunners where to fire, as he was marching toward the place where he saw the English endeavour to go over, he was killed with a great Shot from one of their Batteries as he rid down the Hill of Kilco∣modon, the place where the main stress of the Battle was fought, being just under the Irish Camp. When the General fell, one of his Retinue threw a Cloak over his Corps, and soon after removed him behind the Hill, his Guard going off at the same time, which the Irish Horse perceiving, a great many of them drew off also, and in a short time their Army was dri∣ven to the Top of Killcomodon Hill, where their Camp had laid, which being levelled, and exposed to the English Shot more openly, they began now to run down-right, the Foot towards a great Bog behind them on their Left, and the Horse on the high way towards Loughreah.
But during all this Action in the Right Wing and Center of the Army, those towards the Left, that first engaged, kept their Ground, and little hapned on that side for near 2 Hours, and neither did the Danish Horse and Foot that were on the Left of all, disturb the Enemy as yet, but stood opposite to several Bodies of Horse and Foot that faced them, on the other side of the small Brook. But then perceiving Mackay's Batta∣lions to drive the Enemy before them, least these Bodies that faced them should fall back to the relief of the flying Party, they engaged them, and for about half an Hour it was hot work; But the Irish being then upon the decline, they all fled out of the Field, their Foot being miserably slaugter'd by the English Horse and Dragoons, and their Horse pursued nigh 3 Miles, yet the Night coming on, with a thick Misty Rain, prevented the English from getting between them and a very advantageous Pass near Loughreagh, which gave many of them an opportunity to escape: However it was computed, there were no less than 7000 of them slain upon the Spot, and of the English 600 Soldiers killed, besides 73 Officers, and 960 wounded; to which number, if we add Officers, they will amount to near 1100 in all, which still makes this Battle to be the more considerable, since the English Army did not make up above 17000 Horse and Foot, and the Irish about 20000 Foot and 5000 Horse and Dragoons. The English Army lay upon their Arms all that Night, but then taking some days of Refreshment, the General having received divers Informations concerning the State of Galloway, the most considerable place now left in the Hands of the Irish, next to Limerick, resolved to direct his March thither; when he had posted his Troops, he sent in a Trumpet to summon the Garrison, who was answered by the Lord Dillon the Go∣vernour, that Monsieur d' Vssone, who commanded in chief, was of the same opinion with himself, and the rest of the Officers, that they were resolved to defend the place to the last: But for all this Resolution, when the English had passed part of the Army over the River, and taken the Fort the Irish were building, they beat a Parley, and Hostages were ex∣changed; But the Irish demurring upon the manner of Sur∣rendry, made the General impatient, who sent once or twice to hasten their Resolutions; and at last Lieutenant Colonel Burk, one of the Hostages was permitted to go in, whom Major-General Talmash, being, as was believed, inclined to lay the Treaty aside, desired, When they were ready to begin again, to give the English a sign, by firing a Gun into the Air; but the other replied, That they would not fire from within, till the other provoked them to it from without.Galloway surrendered And so after some time, the Articles were agreed on, and the Town surrendred on the 20th of July into the hands of the English; the conse∣quence
whereof was the Submission of Baldarick O Donnel, who had a considerable number of Men under his Command, and in some time after, the marching of the English Army towards Limerick, with a full intention, by the Conquest of that place, to compleat that of Ireland.Limerick besieged. There they arrived on the 25th of Aug. (where my Lord Tyrconnell died some Days before) and that same day possess'd themselves of Ireton's and Cromwel's Forts, which were now ordered to be called Mackay's and Nassau's, because gained under those Commanders. Two days after, Castle-Connell and another called Carruk a Gunnel, standing upon the River 3 Miles below the Town, were at∣tacked by Detachments from the Army and the Garrisons of both made Prisoners of War; and at the same time the Eng∣lish Ships came up the River, and fired some Shots into the Irish Horse Camp that was then near the River, which put the Irish out of Countenance, who till then were made to believe, that either the English had to Ships there, or else that those they had would quickly be swallowed up by the French Fleet, which they hourly expected. But tho' the Siege was carried on with great Vigour, and that in the interi the Irish quitted several small places daily in the Country, and Brigadier Levison routed several of their Parties in the County of Kerry, and that the Cannon and Bombs did very great Execution upon their Camp, and within the Town, yet on the 17th of Sept. it was hotly disputed in a Council of War, whether they should go on with the Siege, or march over the River to destroy all the Enemies Forage in the Coun∣ty of Clare, and then make a Blockade, and it was so far car∣ried for the latter, that an Engineer was ordered to go with a Guard towards Kilmalock, and fortifie that Place: But be∣fore he got out of the Camp, he was countermanded, and a great many Palisado's brought to Mackay's Fort, as if the Ar∣my intended to Winter there. On the 19th it was resolved to pass the River with a Party, either to prosecute the Siege, or at least to burn the Forage. And that same day a Battery was raised between Ireton's Fort and the old Church, to flank the Irish, in case of a Sally from St. John's Gate; and Four Mortars were brought from the great Battery to Mackay's Fort, that place being judged the fittest for bombarding, since the whole Town lay in a Line from thence; and Orders were given, in case of an Allarm from the Irish Troops with∣out, that every Regiment should stand to the Posts assign'd them for that end: But the Irish declined to hazzard any thing. On the 20th most of the heavy Cannon that were not drawn off, were now sent on Ship-board; and I remember very well, upon the News of this in England, most intelli∣gent Persons were of Opinion the Town would not be taken this Year, tho' the News of Sligo's being surrendred to the
Earl of Granard, came confirmed at the same time. But the General was indefatigable in his business; For on the 22d he march'd with most of the Horse and Dragoous over the Bridge of Boats they had laid, into the County of Clare, lea∣ving Mackay and Talmash to command on this side. And all that Morning the Enemy continually fired upon them from several Batteries, but without any great Harm. In the Af∣ternoon a Party of Colonel Matthews Dragoons was attack'd by a stronger Party of the Enemy, till being sustained by a greater Force, between whom continued some small firings till about 4 a Clock, when the Foot came up, which made the Irish retire till they were got under their Cannon. Then all the English Granadiers, sustained by 4 Regiments of Foot, were commanded to advance and attack the Works that co∣vered Thumond-Bridge, being one Fort to the Right, above a Musket-shot from the Bridge, and another to the Left, some∣what nearer, besides several other natural Fortifications wherein the Enemy had posted a Detachment of about 200 Men, between whom and the English there was a hot Dispute at first, and their Cannon playing from the King's Castle, and 2 or 3 more Batteries, as also their small Shot from the Walls, made the Attack seem very hazardous, and the Eng∣lish were ordered not to approach so nigh the Town as they did. However, the Irish being now pressed upon by the Granadiers, they quitted their first Posts, and then were re∣inforced by another Detachment from the Town; But all this could not do their business: For the English Granadiers were so forward, and despised all Danger to that degree, that they put the whole Body to flight, and pursued them so close, that a French Major, who commanded at Thumond-Gate, fearing the English would enter the Town with the o∣ther, ordered the Draw-bridge to be plucked up, and left the whole Party to the Mercy of the English, who shewed them little; for all of them were either killed or taken, ex∣cept about 120, who got into the Town before the Bridge was drawn up: There were also many of them drowned. Hereupon the English lodged themselves within 10 yards of the Bridge, notwithstanding an high Tower that stood near the end of the Bridge next to them; and the Irish find∣ing now all Communication cut off between them and their Horse, and despairing of the French Succours, began to think of giving up the Town, whereof the English in general had no great Hopes; who however, push'd on the Siege next day, being the 23d of Sept. with much ury, and notwithstanding it proved very rainy, yet the Guns and Mortars ceased not to play upon the Town, nor the Enemy to fire more furiously than they had done for some time before. But towards Night the Rain began to cease, and both Storms ended to∣gether:
For about 6 the Enemy beat a Parley on both sides the Town, and next day in the Morning Lieutenant-General Sarsfield and Major-General Waughup came out to the Gene∣ral, and desired a Cessation of Arms might be continued for 3 Days, till they could send to their Horse, who then were encamped towards Clare, in order to their being included in the general Capitulation which they then proposed; which was agreed to, and thereupon the Prisoners in the Town were released. On the 29th Sarsfield and Waughup dined with the General, and then it was agreed Hostages should be exchanged in order to a further Treaty, which was done accordingly. And next day the Irish sent out their Proposals, but in such extravagant Terms, that the General was so far from grant∣ing them, that he returned Answer, That tho' he was a Stranger to the Laws of England, yet he understood that those things they insisted upon, were so far contradictory to them, and so dishonou∣rable to himself, that he could not grant any such thing: And thereupon ordered a new Battery immediately to be raised; but upon the Request of the Irish, he sent them in 12 Ar∣ticles, which proved to be the Sum of the Capitulation; for Sarsfield and others came on the 29th to the General and after long Debate agreed upon Articles, not only for the Surren∣der of Limerick, but all other Forts and Castles in the King∣dom then in possession of the Irish; So that they were signed Oct. 3d by both Parties. They consisted of two parts, Civil and Military, the first being signed by the Lords Justices and General, but the latter on our Part only by the General, and both here follow. I.

Octob. 91. Baron De Ginckle. To say nothing of other things in this Place, you see that s many of the Irish Army as were willing of themselves to e transported into France, might freely do it. But the General on the 5th of Oct. receiving a Letter from a Lieu∣enant-Colonel in the Irish Army, wherein he complained e was imprisoned for denying to go into France, he took it ery ill, and ordered 4 Guns to be carried down immediate∣ly,
and planted upon Bolls-Bridge, saying in some Heat, He would teach them to play Tricks with him; which Sarsfield hear∣ing, he came to the English Camp, and several sharp Word passed between the General and him; Sarsfield saying a last, That he was then in the General's Power. Not so (repli∣ed the other) but you shall go in, and do the best you can. But at last all things were quiet, and the Prisoner enlarged; and as many of the Irish as would go, were some time after shipped off for France, where, upon their Arrival, they were saluted with a comforting Letter from the late King James, directed to Lieutenant-General Sheldon, then the O∣ficer in Chief with them, which was to this Effect: JAMES REX, HAving been informed of the Capitulation and Surrender Limerick,K. James's Letter to the Irish. and of the other Places which remained to in our Kingdom of Ireland, and of the Necessities which fo the Lords Justices, and the General Officers of our Forces the unto; We will not defer to let you know, and the rest of the ficers that come along with you, that we are extreamly satis with your and their Conduct, and of the Valour of the Soldie during the Siege, but most particularly of your and their Dec∣ration and Resolution to come and serve where we are. And assure you, and order you to assure both Officers and Soldiers are come along with you, that we shall never forget this Loyalty, nor-fail, when in a Capacity, to give them, above oth particular Marks of our Favour. In the mean time you are inform them, that they are to serve under our Command, and our Commissions; and if we find that a considerable number is with the Fleet, it will induce us to go personally to see them, Regiment them. Our Brother the King of France, hath alre given Orders to Cloath them, and furnish them with all Neces∣ries, and to give them Quarters of Refreshment. So we bid heartily farewel. Given at our Court at St. Germ the 27th of November, 1691. And thus ended this famous Irish War,The Irish War ended. with so much more Glory and Advantage to the English, in that the were so powerfully supported in it by the French Ki who thought it much to his Interest to divert their that way, whose Ancestors had done such terrible things his Country, and had sent a good Fleet of Men of War Store-Ships to the Relief of this last Town, which arri in Dingle-Bay but a day or two after the Articles were . The Scotch Affairs were so inconsiderable this Season,Our Sea-Af∣fairs noted. th there is nothing worth mentioning from thence; neith
was there any thing extraordinary hapned by Sea, tho' the Fleets on each side were very powerful; and that one should think, the French, elated with their last Years Success, might have adventured a second Fight now: But they knew what they did well enough, for they had another-guess Force and Admiral too to deal with now, and they had another Game to Play, which was to intercept our Turkey Fleet, which was exceeding Rich; and to that end, cruised a long time upon the Irish-Coast: But as Providence would have it, they had been gone but about 10 days from hovering about Kingsale, before the other came, having all that time been held back by contrary Winds in their Passage from Cales. The English Grand Fleet all this time kept another Course, but it was not for want of Zeal or Fidelity in the brave Admiral, but of Intelligence. Yet as soon as the brave Admiral Russel, now Earl of Oxford, understood that they were got safe into Kingsale, he took all the care imaginable for their being con∣voy'd safely to their respective Ports whither they were bound, and then set sail in quest of the Enemy, whom he was inform'd were turn'd to their own Coasts: But being come within some Leagues of Brest, he understood they lay at Bell-Isle, secured in such a manner, that it was impossible to attack them, and so returned towards the English Shore, but met with such tempestuous and stormy Weather, that the Coronation, a brave Ship, and to the best of my Remem∣brance, one or two more Ships of less Consideration, were lost; and the Admiral himself had much ado to get the rest of the Fleet safe into Harbour, where now we leave them, and come to see where King William was all the while. We have already given you an account of the Congress at the Hague,The Cam∣pag in Flanders. the Progress of the French Arms in the Spring, both in Savoy and in Flanders, and how the King could not en∣gage them then in the latter, and so he went for England; where he made no long stay before he returned again into the Netherlands to head the Confederate Army, which in Foot was somewhat superiour to that of France, but in Horse the latter was stronger. But tho' his Majesty did all that Man could do to bring Monsieur Luxemburg to an Engage∣ment by several Marches and Countermarches he made, as well as Umbrages he gave him of attacking Maubge or Mons, yet all would not do, the other as industriously avoid∣ing fighting, and would give no Opportunity for it, but upon the greatest Disadvantage; so that the King, after he had first blown up the Fortifications of Beaumon, marched the Army towards Aeth, from whence he parted on the 16th of Sept. for Loo, leaving the Forces under the Command of Prince Waldeck, who continued about the aforesaid Place for some time: But moving off about the 17th of Sept. towards
Benair, Monsieur Luxemburg thought it a good Opportunity to fall upon their Rear with a good Body of Horse, and the best in France, and continued his design'd March so swiftly, that upon the 19th he came up with their Rear-guard as they were marching towards Cambrun, before any of the Confederates knew any thing of the matter: Nay, when Count Tilly, who commanded in the Rear, sent the General an Express of it, he could hardly believe it. But the first Line of the Confederates was hardly drawn up, before they were charged by the French King's Houshold, while the se∣cond was forming of such Troops as were ordered to pass the River, with all the speed that might be. The Conflict was very terrible, and the first Line of the Confederates was constrained to a disorderly Retreat; but they rallied again behind their second Line, which last gave Ground also be∣fore the Enemy: But the Confederates Cavalry rallied in the sight of the French near the place of Action, the French not daring to return to the Charge, who perhaps were loath to push it on too far for fear of the Infantry, and thought they had already done enough to kill them above a 1000 Men, and some of good Quality, with the loss themselves of about half the Number, and with this Action the Cam∣paign ended on that side; While the Spaniards remained pretty well content that they had lost no more but Mon, which tho' it were considerable,The Cam∣paign in Catalonia. yet they were more net∣tled, at some thing that happened to them nearer hom For the Duke of Noailles who commanded the French Forces advancing himself with part of the Army to Belver, to make head against the Spanish Troops, sent the rest under the Command of Lieutenant-General Chazeron, to besiege Vrgel which, tho' no very undefensible Place, besides that it ha a Garrison of 1500 Men in it, and most of them consisting of Regular Troops, yet they basely gave it up in a littl time; and themselves, both Soldiers and Officers to be Pri∣soners of War, only the Militia were dismiss'd home: And notwithstanding the Court at Madrid, being mightily sur∣prized herewith, sent several Reinforcements to the Vice-Roy, yet they could neither hinder the French to fortif Belver, nor make any other Diversion; And I am ashame to say, That when the Duke of Medina Sidonia advanced attack Proto Melo, that most of his Troops forsook him having no great Stomack to the Business. But, and if th Spaniards thus appear'd both weak and dastardly by Lad you cannot think they were in much better Condition Sea, since they could not prevent the Mareschal d' Estrees bombard Barcelona for two days together, by which he thre in several hundreds of Bombs, which wrought a terrible D∣solation in the City.
And now having briefly shewed how ill it went with the Spaniards every way, we are to observe on the German side, that the French were rather Winners than Losers;The Cam∣paign on the Upper Rhine. For tho' their Design of surprizing the City of Mentz by a treache∣rous Correspondence they held in the Place with one of the Emperor's Commissaries, Consburg, a Whestphalian, utterly failed them by a timely Discovery of the Treason, yet they could not go out of that Neighbourhood without doing some∣thing; and therefore they attack'd Algesheim, which is not above 5 or 6 Leagues off, and after some Resistance took it; and they for the present retired towards Creutznach. But tho' great things were expected from the Elector of Saxony and General Schoning, the former whereof Commanded the Imperial Army in Chief this Campaign, who had Count Cap∣rara under him; and that, notwithstanding the French who were apprehensive the Germans design'd to cross the Rhine, took all the care they could to prevent it, by entrenching themselves near Manheim, as supposing the other would at∣tempt it some-where thereabouts, the German Forces did actually pass the said River not far from the forementioned Place; yet they could make no Benefit of it, but rather the contrary; for the French, to divert them, passed the Rhine also at Phillipsburg, which after a hot Consultation, made the others to follow them, yet not with that Expedition and Success, but that the other took the Town of Portzheim, situate in the Marquisate of Baden Dourlach, 3 Leagues from Grosinguen, in a Neck of Land that gives an In-let into the Country of Wirtemberg, which they had all along a design to put under Contribution, and had never so fair a Prospect of effecting it as at this time; with which, and the taking of another little Place called Genbach, besides the Ravaging of that part of Juliers that belongs to the Elector Palatine, was their Summer's Work that way. But they made a much more considerable Progress on the side of Italy; For besides the Success already mentioned to have attended their Arms in the Spring of the Year, by taking of Nice, the Summer was not far advanced when they took in also Villana,Carmagnolae besieged, and taken. which induced Monsieur Catinat to un∣dertake the Siege of Carmagnola, being a Place seated in the Marquisate of Saluces, and not above 9 Miles distant from Turin, the Capital City of Piedmont. The Trenches were opened June the 8th, and 3 Attacks formed, which were carried on with so much Vigour, that the Besieged finding themselves so closely blocked up on all sides, and without hopes of Succour, it was agreed the disciplined Men should march out with their Arms, and the Militia with a white Stick in their Hands, and be conducted to Turin: This was no sooner done, but the Marquess de Feuquieres was com∣manded
with a considerable Detachment of Horse, Foot and Dragoons, to invest Coni, a Place considerably strong by Nature,Coni be∣sieged. and garrisoned with 700 Vaudois and French Refu∣gees, and about 500 of the Militia of Mondovi, with some other Troops commanded by the Count de la Rovere; And be∣fore it was invested, the Regiment of Saluces, together with some other Troops, to the number of near 3000 were or∣dered to put themselves into the Place: But Feuquieres ha∣ving notice of their March, he attacked them with a great deal of Vigour, and there were abundance of Men slain on both sides, and the Issue was that part of the Relief at last entred the Town, which was presently invested by the French, to the number of 14000 Men, who push'd on the Siege very smartly; the Garrison at the same time being as obstinate in their Defence: So that now 17 days were spun out, when Prince Eugine of Savoy was sent with a Detach∣ment of 4000 Horse, and 6000 Men of the Militia of Mon∣dovi to relieve it.Coni re∣lieved. This Monsieur Catinat had no sooner no∣tice of, but he sent an Express to Monsieur de Bullond, who commanded now at the Siege, not to stir out of his Lines, with a farther notice of a Detachment of 2500 Men that were on their march to re-inforce him, under the Com∣mand of Camp-Mareschal Sylvester. However the Mistake happened, Bullond thought it convenient to raise the Siege, and that with so much Haste and Confusion, that he left be∣hind him one Piece of Cannon, 3 Mortars, good store of Bombs, Powder, and other War-like Ammunition, besides good store of Provision, and other War-like Utensils, with several sick Men; But for his Reward Catinat had Orders to seize him. But by this time the German Succours, to the number of 8000 good Soldiers, with the Elector of Bavaria at the Head of them, were come, which made Catinat, who before pre∣tended no less than to besiege Turin it self, to repass the Po with his Army, and send Expresses to Court to send him some Re-inforcement; while the Marquess de Hoquincourt in the mean time besieged and took the Town of Montmelian, the Duke of Savoy thinking to relieve it, in vain: But the Ca∣stle required a greater Strength to master it, yet of this by and by. We shall now see what the Duke of Savoy did after so great a Re-inforcement from Germany. They laboured all they could to engage Catinat to a Battel, but he as in∣dustriously declined it; So that at last the Confederates find∣ing it would not do, they passed the Po near Carde, and on the 27th of Sept. Prince Eugine of Savoy invested Carmagnola, and by the 3d of Oct. the Trenches were opened, and 26 great Cannon and 8 Mortars arrived from Turin: Three se∣veral Attacks being raised the same day, between which
were Lines of Communication made on the 4th, from thence to the 7th the Siege was carried vigorously on, when they began to throw Bombs into the Town, and at the same time received Advice, That Catinat, after having quitted Fossano, Savillana, and Saluces, was retreated towards Pigne∣rol, but on the 8th the Garrison beat a Parley, and the Ca∣pitulation was signed the next Morning upon honourable Terms.Carmagnola retaken. I have given an account before how the French pos∣sest themselves of this Place; but I did not mention, that the Articles upon which it was given up to them were not performed with the Fidelity they ought to have been; for the French took from the Vaudois, that were in Garrison, their Cannon, Arms, and Baggage, and threatned to detain them Prisoners, if they did not give up what was demanded of them without Resistance: But for this the other resol∣ved to be now revenged upon them, and therefore they way-laid the French upon the Road, and assailed them with extraordinary Courage, taking away their Arms and a good part of their Baggage, which the Germans observing, they thought it much better to be doing also than looking on, and so they compleatly gleaned the poor French of what the Vaudois had left them. Of this, tho' Monsieur Catinat made heavy Complaint, yet all the Answer given him, was, That they were truly sorry it should so happen, but that he himself had set them the first Example; however, that for the future they would take care to prevent any such Disorders. All this, to∣gether with the Vaudois, the very next day after the Surren∣der of Carmagnala, beating 3000 of the French, that were detached to do Mischief, into the Vallies, and killing about 500 of his Men, made the French General very uneasie. However, this did not hinder the Council of France from resolving upon the Reduction of the Fortrss of Montmelian, whether Monsieur Catinat was ordered to repair to take the Command of the Army upon him, which arrived before the Place on the 16th of Nov. and after a most vigorous Siege, wherein they were to Conflict as well with the Rigour of the Season,Montmelian Fortress sur∣rendred. as the desperate Defence of the Garrison, it was at last surrendred to them upon the 22d of Dec. upon ho∣nourable Terms, and by it they became now entire Masters of all the Dutchy of Savoy; the French King all this while, being caressing the States of Italy by his Embassador, the Count of Rebenac, for fear, the Apprehensions of the Dan∣ger they might be in, because of the success of his Arms, might move them to close in with the Confederates, and thereby encrease the number of his Enemies, who, as they stood, might prove too many for him.
Now 'tis time for us to leave Italy, and see what has been doing in Hungary: The 2 last Years were as different in Suc∣cess to the two contending Parties, as perhaps ever was known; and the Turks, no doubt, were now big with Expe∣ctations, and possibly had hopes to regain all their Losses by another Campaign, for which they had made very great Preparations; neither was the Emperor, on his part, back∣ward therein, but engaging the Prince of Baden to Command the Army, he pretty late in the Summer joined the same near Peter-Waradin, from whence he decamped with a Re∣solution to march towards the Enemy, who lay about Semlin on this side the Save, and whose Cavalry on the 10th of Aug. shewed themselves in the Morning drawn up in a Line a little from the Imperial Army; But this was only an Amusement, they having no intention to fight: For tho' the Prince came very near the Turkish Camp on the 12th, and did all he could to provoke them, they would not stir out of it; but he did not at all think it adviseable to at∣tack them there, since they were invironed with a broad deep Moat, defended with good Redoubts, and a 150 Pieces of Cannon mounted upon Batteries, and therefore he re∣treated a little to tempt them to come forth, and so much the rather, because they were forced to go as far as Salanke∣men for the Provisions that were sent to the Army, which could not come any further by Water, because the Turks were more numerous in Saicks upon the River from that place than the Christians were: And in effect, the Prince was not mistaken in his Conceptions, for the Turks think∣ing the Christians were fled, sent some Troops to fall up∣on the Rear, which they did all the while the Army march'd, who still continued in motion on the 17th, tho' it was so misty that they could hardly discern one another: But as soon as it cleared up, they heard the Turkish Drums, and found their whole Army was marching towards them; yet because the winding of the Danube hindered the sight of the Enemy in that part, only in the flank; the Christians made a motion to secure the Saicks that lay at Salankemen, and to have them to that purpose in Front, and tho' the Army was posted well, yet upon the 18th, Orders were given to re∣tire into a more advantageous Post, and to possess all the rising Ground about Salankemen. But while this was doing, and by that time that it was day, they discovered upon the right hand a considerable Body of Turks, marching in or∣der of Battle upon the right Road to Peter-Waradin, with a design to prevent the Christians from making themselves Masters of the first Hillocks near Salankemen; and their Ves∣sels and Saicks at the same time near unto those of the Chri∣stians, with a design to seize them, and 3 or 4000 Horse en∣gaged with the Left Wing along the Danube, skirmishing all day, but still retiring when the Christians made any
shew of resistance; while Buquo's Regiment of Dragoons, (that in the mean time was detach'd to convoy 200 Wagons that came from Peter-Waradin) was surrounded by a considerable Bo∣dy of the Enemy, and after long resistance, were almost all cut in Pieces and made Prisoners, notwithstanding some small De∣tachments sent to their Relief, who could do no good against such an unequal Number, and the Loss of this Regiment was not only confirmed the same Day by an Adjutant of Caprara's Regiment, who made his Escape, but that the Recruits of the Regiments of Hoffkirken and Caprara had fallen under the same Misfortune, and that all the Baggage, Women, Wa∣gons and led Horses were lost, with 200 Wagon Load of Provision, and 1200 Oxen that drew them. In the mean time, they perceived that the Enemies Army lay posted along the Danube upon rising Grounds, much more advantageous than those possest by the Christians, and that they were at work to fortifie them and to cut off the Christians Commu∣nication with Peter-Waradin. The Prince of Baden saw plain∣ly he had a desperate Game to play, and that he must either force the Turks in their Entrenchments, or perish in a Station where there were no Provisions to be had from any other place; whereupon the former was resolved on, and to be the next Day, which was the 19th of Aug. at what time all things were ordered in the following manner. Duke Christian of Holstein, who was on that part of the Right Wing next the Da∣nube with his own Regiment and that of Neuburg, was to make himself Master of the rising Ground, that separated the Im∣perial Army from the Enemy, and by that means to open a way for the Body of the Army; and these were to be seconded by 20 Battalions, under the Command of General Souches and Camp-Mareschal Staremburg, and the Army which followed in order of Battle, had orders to extend it self as much as possible from the Danube to the Plain, while the Left Wing had orders to march through the Plain, and attack the Ene∣my in Flank and Rear, and this was to be the principal At∣tack,The Battle of Saanke∣men. because the Turks had posted almost all their Janizaries, and planted all their Cannon upon the rising Ground against the Right Wing of the Christians, having nothing to secure their Flanks but only some Wagons bound together, and lying almost open in the Rear. It was very difficult for the Germans to approach them, be∣cause of the Hills, Vallies and Miry Ways, which they were to cross; and tho' they had decamped very early in the Morn∣ing, the Attack was not begun by the Right Wing till 3 in the Afternoon, and they labour'd hard to carry the Trenches; But in regard, the Left Wing which was to fetch a great Compass, through very bad ways, required a considerable time to get near the Enemy, those of the Infidels who perceived it, had
leasure to advance with their Horse; and with the same design to fall upon the Imperialists in the Rear. In the mean time, the 2 Battalions of the Right Wing attack'd the Entrench∣ments, and advanced where the greatest number of Janiza∣ries were drawn up in very good order of Battle, and very strongly entrenched, having a wide Moat before them defen∣ded with good Redoubts, 100 Paces one from another, with which the Imperialists were strangely surprized, who knew how little time the Turks had to do it: But however all this could not hinder them from bravely advancing to the Trenches, at what time some of the Granadiers went down into the Moat, crossed it, and got up to the very Trenches: But all this was attended with much Loss, for besides the playing of the Ene∣mies great and small Shot continually upon them, the Jani∣zaries came also 3 times out of their Trenches with their Scy∣meters in their Hands, and fell with extraordinary Fury up∣on the Imperial Foot that were almost tired and suffocated with the Fire and Smoak. Holstein and Newburg's Regiments of Horse, and 2 or 3 others suffered very much thro' the con∣tinual Firing of the Cannon of the Janizaries. And at the same time all the Left Wing of the Enemies Cavalry fell up∣on the Right Wing of the Christians, and very rudely hand∣led the Regiments of Caprara, Serau and Beck, that were the first exposed to their Fury. At that time the Prince of Ba∣den seeing them in some disorder, and perceiving his Left Wing was got at some distance from the Enemy, advanced with some Troops that had not yet fought, and flew with that Vigor upon the Infidels, that he forced them to give Ground, whereby a stop was put to the Fury of the Enemies Left Wing for a while: But they resuming fresh Courage, fell again upon the Regiments of Caprara and Serau, whom they drave upon the Battalions of Beck and Kaunisch, who were by that means utterly ruined, before they had time to make their first Discharge upon their Adversaries; yet the Troops of the second Line, that began already to totter, being supported by two Regiments more, took fresh Courage, and all things were well again in that Wing. Now the Prince of Baden, whose design was only to amuse the Enemy on that side, and whose principal drift was to charge them in Flank and Rear, seeing all things well restored in the Right Wing, hastned, with other Generals to the Left, and being arrived at the Turks Camp, ordered the Hunga∣rians and Rascians, to the number of 5000 to break in, who pre∣sently overthrew all before them, making a most dreadful Slaughter of the Infidels, and this was the beginning of the Turks ruin. For the Hungarians and Rascians being seconded by the Regiment of Hoffkirk, and 4 or 5 more that composed the Left Wing, the Spahi's and Janizaries defended themselves well
for a time, but at last were utterly defeated; the Spahi's brake thro' the Battle of the Imperialists, and the 2 Lines of their Horse received the bloody effects of all their Shot. But the Ja∣nizaries, who stood a little longer, fled some one way, some ano∣ther, Night only putting an end to the Slaughter. However they continued the pursuit next Day, and the Days following, and killed a great number that hid themselves in the Bogs among the Rushes, and in other by-places: And the immediate con∣sequence of this Defeat was the Imperialists possessing them∣selves of the Field of Battle, of all the Tents, Cannon, and all the Baggage, and of all the Enemies Ammunition and Provisi∣on; The Mony also for the Payment of the Soldiers fell into the Germans Hands, but that proved to be no great Purchase, for they found the greatest part of the Coin they made use of was Copper: But for all that, the Booty must certainly be very great, though at the same time it cost the Christians dear. For besides the advantage of their Camp; it is past all doubt, that the In∣fidels never fought with so much Obstinacy and Courage, as at this time, there being not a Battalion or Squadron that was not oblig'd to Fight, nor an Officer that was not in the thickest of the Action, and forced to discharge his Pistols several times, like the meanest private Soldier. The Loss on both sides is almost incredible, the Conquerors themselves owning they had about 7000 killed and wounded in all, and among them, a great number of good Officers; but of the Infidels, they reckoned no less than 18000 Men to have perished in this Battle, and almost all their Officers were killed, wounded, or taken Prisoners; and to compleat this terrible Loss, there were found not only the Serasquier, and principal Aga of the Janizaries among the slain, but even the Grand Visier Cuper∣gli, who was the most accomplish'd Person in all the Ottoman Empire; And this great Defeat of Mahomet's Followers, was so much the more remarkable, in that their overthrow has been many Years ago calculated by the Learned Brightman out of the Revelations,Duke of Croy succes∣full in Scla∣vonia. for the present Year. However, the Successes that attended this great Victory, were not so con∣siderable as might have been expected; 'tis true, General Caprara retook Lippa, and the Duke of Croy in Sclavonia, after he had possest himself of the Castle of Broda, march'd to Gran∣disca, which the Turks abandon'd and fir'd upon his Approach,Great Wa∣radin bloc∣kaded. as they had done before by Possega, and from thence he went to Bagaros, whose Garrison, after some small Resistance, were made to surrender at Discretion, by which means all Sclavo∣nia became entirely reduced under the Emperor's Obedience: Yet there was but little Progress made in the Siege of Great Waradin, tho' the Imperial Troops attack'd it with much Vi∣gour, which after all, they were forced to turn into a Block∣ade. With this ended the Campaign in Hungary, during
which, Sir William Hussey, the King of England's Embassador at the Ottoman Port, was negotiating a Peace between the 2 Empires, tho' with but little appearance of Success. There being nothing at all either considerable as to the War,The King of Poland's Campaign. or otherwise memorable as to the Venetians this Year; I shall pass on from them to the Poles, whose King at the Head of his Army, that were about 20000 strong, once more fell into Moldavia, with a further design of marching that way into Budziack; yet the Poles had not advanced far into the for∣mer Country, but that they were informed a great Body of Tartars had taken the Field, and roam'd about their Camp to snap their Convoys, which made the King send Prince Lu∣bomirski, Mareschal of the Crown with 1500 Horse to observe their Motions. Of this the Tartars having Intelligence, they laid an Ambuscase for him, which succeeded so well on their part, that the Prince found himself quickly invironed on both sides, and no possibility of retreating without cutting his way thro': Wherefore he sent to give the King immediate Infor∣mation of his Condition, who judging well there was no time to lose, set forwards towards the Tartars with all speed; But they retreated so fast, that he could but do very little Exe∣cution upon them. Hereupon the Polish Army advanced to Jassi, which the Hospodar had again quitted, and who stood still firm to the Turkish Interest, for all the King of Poland could do to bring him off of it, and of which Place the Poles not only took Possession, but also of divers others, as Roman, Nimick and Novacran; and after having provided for the Se∣curity of them, the King thought it convenient to retreat with the whole Army, the Season being too far spent to ad∣vance any further, so that his principal design, which was to fall into Budziack, came to just nothing: However the Ca∣stellan of Chelm, after having with a Body of Cossacks routed 4000 Tartars, who came to relieve it, took the Fortress of Sorock, seated upon the Neister; and this was all that was done before the Army went into Quarters: So that now having run through the Course of the Progress of the several Armies this Season, there is nothing more remaining, but to observe a few Remarkables this Year. On the 1st of February,Pope Alex∣ander VIII. his Death. died Alexander VIII. Pope of Rome, being aged 81 Years, after he had sat 15 Months and 21 Days in St. Peter's Chair, as they call it, being Elected the 16th of October 1689. And after 5 Months and an halfs Dispute, Cardinal Pignatelli was, on Thursday the 12th of Ju∣ly, chosen into his Room, being then 76 Years and 4 Months old. He took the Name of Innocent XII. upon him, in re∣membrance of Innocent XI. who had promoted him to the Cardinal Dignity on the 1st of Sept. 1681, and of whose In∣clination and Interest he had been a long Observer.
The 16th of July has been very noted for the Death of Monsieur Louvois, chief Minister and Secretary of State in France,Monsieur Louvois Death. and tho' without Contradiction, one of the ablest Heads in Europe, yet the Confederates did not find such an Altera∣tion in the French Politicks upon it, as some have expected, which clearly shews, France is a Country not barren of great Statesmen, as well as brave Soldiers, to say nothing of his Capacity who is at the head of them all. The Death of this great Man was sudden, for having dined with the Prince d' Espinoy, and Madam de Soubize, and found himself ill in the King's Chamber, he retired to be let Blood, but not finding a∣ny ease by bleeding in one Arm, and being extremely oppres∣sed, he would needs be bled in the other, and died at the same time. This Year was also fatal to John George Elector of Saxony,The Elector of Saxony's Death. who having the Command of the Confederate Army upon the Rhine, dyed at Tubing on the 22d. of Sept. He had by Anna Sophia, Daughter of Frederick III. King of Denmark, John George IV. that succeeded him, who was born on the 17th of Oct. 1668. and Frederick Augustus born on the 12th of May, since by the Death of his Brother, become Elector of Saxony, and now confirmed King of Poland. Now again in conformity to the method we have all along pursued, we shall inspect a little into the Affairs of our own Country in the first place, before we look into those abroad. In Nov. last Year, the Parliament began to sit, before whom the King laid the Success of his Arms in the intire Reduction of Ireland,Parliament meets. hoping it was an earnest of future Successes, which their timely Assistance to him might procure to them; then he urged to them the necessity of a strong Fleet, and lastly recommended to them Dispatch of Business, which if negle∣cted, an opportunity would be lost, which could never be rea∣sonably hoped for again: But tho' the Parliament upon this occasion promised the most speedy Supplies that could be, yet his Majesty did not think there was hast enough made, answerable to his Designs abroad, and therefore as early as the 10th of Jan. this Year, he was pleased, after returning his hearty thanks to the Houses for what they had already done, to quicken them in their pace with such cogent Argu∣ments, that all Bills were ready for signing by the 5th of March, when his Majesty passed several Acts, and among others, one for raising Mony by a Poll-tax; and then having told his Parliament of his Intentions to go beyond Sea, the two Houses were given to understand that it was his pleasure they should adjourn to the 12th of April:Parliament adjourned. The King in conformi∣ty to his Resolutions went for Holland accordingly, where he landed on the 16th of March, and after some stay at the Hague
went to Loo, and thence to the Army; but of this more by and by: Now you are to understand that the King had no sooner turn'd his back, but it was rumoured up and down every where that the late King was ready to land in England with a great Army, whither he had sent his Declaration set∣ting forth his Right,Conspiracy in England. inviting People to joyn him, and threat∣ning all that opposed him with severest punishment, and that Party was thereupon as uppish, as they had been ever impu∣dent: The Queen did hereupon give immediate Orders for hastning out the Fleet, having the Militia in a readiness, and some Forcesd esigned for Flanders were countermanded, which together with other Troops remaining then in the Kingdom, did in some time after form a Camp near Portsmouth. In short, 'tis not to be doubted but the late King had real thoughts of throwing off the Abdication at this time, having a conside∣rable Army posted on the Coasts of Normandy, ready to em∣bark as soon as the French Fleet, which was hourly expected up the Channel, did appear. It was thought also that there had been some bold attempts made about this time to infest the Fleet; however it were, the Admiral's address and vi∣gilancy kept them clear, and brought the Officers unani∣mously to sign an Address to her Majesty, with utmost assu∣rance of their Loyalty, which indeed they failed not to shew upon the occasion that now quickly presented it self unto them. Whether it was King James and his Irishmens Impatience to possess the Estates of England, or some other Intelligence the French King might have to jog him on, I know not, but Monsieur Tourville, with the Fleet, had Orders to make up to the Channel, and to fight the English and Dutch, tho' he was not yet joined by the Thoulon Squadron under d' Estree: But when Tourville came there, he met with an Entertain∣ment, which perhaps he did not dream of; The first Intimati∣ons whereof we at London had in a Letter from Admiral Russel to the Earl of Nottingham, Secretary of State, wherein he said: THat upon the 19th of May,Admiral Russel's Letter. by Three of the Clock in the Morning, Cape Barfleur, bearing S. W. and by S. Seven Leagues off, his Scouts made the Signal for seeing the Enemy, the Wind Westerly; That by 11 the French bore down and engaged him at some distance, and both Fleets continued sighting till half an hour past 5 in the Evening, at which time the Enemy towedt away with all their Boats, and the English after them; That abou 6 there was a fresh Engagement to the Westward of him, which he supposed to be the Blue; That he could give no further Account at present, but only that the French were beaten, and that they were steering away for Conquest-Road, having a fresh Gale Easterly, but extream foggy.
But tho' it hapned to be a Calm all that Night,The French Fleet beaten. and Fog∣gy the next Morning, yet about 11 it beginning to clear up a little, they saw the French Fleet about 2 Leagues from them, very much lessened in their Number, not seeming to be above 36 Sail, after whom they made all the Sail they could; but a∣bout 10 it grew calm again, and about 3 the two Fleets came to an Anchor, but weighed about 11 at Night, anchored next Morning, sailed on the 31st again against the Enemy, the Admiral steering towards Barfleur, and the Durck and Blue Squadron towards the Race of Alderney, thro' which, part of the French Fleet escaped, the other thinking it not ad∣viseable to hazard the Men of War in the pursuit of them through that dangerous Road, tho' Sir John Ashby was after∣wards questioned in Parliament about it: But Sir Ralph Dela∣val Vice-Admiral of the Red, had better Success; for he on the 21st of May, burnt under Cape de Wick, near the Shoar, the Royal Sun, wherein was Count Tourville, Admiral of the French Fleet, carrying 104 Guns, the Admirable, 102; the Conquerant, 80, with 3 more of a lesser Rate, while Admiral Russel himself was no less successful in pursuit of another part of the French, who hawled in for la Hogue, in which Bay he anchored the 21st, and next Day stood in so far as that he saw 13 Ships hawled in close with the Shoar. Whereupon on the 22d he sent in Vice-Admiral Rook with several Men of War and Fire-ships, with the Boats of the Fleet, to endea∣vour to destroy them: But the French had got their Ships so very near Land, that not any of the Men of War, except the small Frigats, could do any Service. However, that Night 6 of the Men of War were burnt, and the next Day the other 7, besides several Transport-ships, whereof 6 were Three-deck'd Ships, and the other carrying from 60 to 76 Guns, only one had but 56, and that Ship was overset and utterly lost. The Attempt was very difficult and dangerous, but it was made with that Conduct and Resolution, and the Seamen in the Boats behaved themselves so bravely, that they took possession of several of the Enemies Ships, and drave the French with their own Guns from their Platforms on the Shoar. This Action was so much the more glorious as well as advantageous to the English, since it was done in the sight of the French and Irish Camp ready to invade us; and the late King was so mortified with the present Disap∣pointment, that he seem'd, by his Letter to the French King, for ever out of hopes to compass his Designs that way; and because some may be curious to read it, take it as fol∣lows. Monsieur, my Brother, I Have hitherto,K. James's Letter to the French King. with something of Constancy and Resolution, supported the Weight of all the Misfortunes which it has pleased Heaven to lay upon me, so long as my self was the only Sufferer:
But I must acknowledge this last Disaster utterly over-whelms me; and I am altogether Comfortless, in reference to what con∣cerns your Majesty, through the great Loss that has befallen your Fleets. I know too well, that my unlucky. Star it is, that has drawn down this Misfortune upon your Forces, always Victorious but when they fought for my Interests. And this is that which plainly tells me, That I no longer merit the support of so great a Monarch, and who is always sure to Vanquish when he fights for himself. For which Reason it is that I request your Majesty, no longer to concern your self for a Prince so unfortunate as my self, but permit me to retire, with my Family, to some Corner of the World, where I may cease to obstruct the usual Course of your Prosperities and Conquests, which only my Misfortune could interrupt. It is not just, that the Potentest Monarch in the World, and the most flourishing above all others, should share in my Disgrace, because you are too Generous: 'Tis better much, that I shall only retire till it shall please Omnipotent Providence to be more propitious to my Affairs. But howsoever it pleases over-ruling Heaven to dispose of Me and Mine, or into what∣soever Recess I may be thrown, I can assure your Majesty, That I shall always preserve, to the last Gasp of my expiring Breath, that due Acknowledgment, which I still retain, of your Favours and constant Friendship. Nor can any thing more contribute to my Consolation, than to hear, as I hope to do, when I have wholly quitted your Dominions, of the quick Return of all your wonted Triumphs both by Sea and Land, over Your Enemies and Mine, when my Interest shall be no longer intermixed with yours. I am, Monsieur, my Brother, Yours, &c. JAMES REX. While we are now, thro' the Blessing of God, secure from any Foreign Invasion, by the good Success of our Fleet a∣gainst the French, there was a Conspiracy as dangerous, and of a much baser Nature contrived abroad by one Granvale, a French Officer, to assassinate his Majesty's Person, who, when he came to the Camp at Bethlehem-Abby, about the 28th of May, was inform'd of the Design, and the foresaid Person secured for the present; but of this you will hear more by and by, when we come to his Tryal. In the mean time how unsuccessful soever the French Fleet had been at Sea, that King was bent upon keeping up the Reputation of his Arms by Land, by making some further Progress this Campaign in the Spanish Netherlands, tho' now in a much better state than formerly, since the Elector of Bavaria be∣came Governour, as he did the beginning of this Year; And therefore on the 22d of May he invested Namur, a
strong Frontier-Garrison, in Person, before which the Tren∣ches were opened on the 1st of June; and tho' upon the News of our Sea-Victory, King William caused all the Eng∣lish Artillery to be drawn in his Camp at Bethlehem, to the top of an Hill, upon the Right of the Army that looked to∣wards Namur, and placed the Dutch Artillery upon the same Hill to the Left, and that the whole Army was drawn out to express their Joy for the same, by a triple Discharge of all the Cannon and small Shot; yet it was said, the French King took so little notice of it, that he should say, Here is a mighty pudder indeed about burning 2 or 3 Ships. But how light soever he might seem to take it, the Consequence shew∣ed, it was the unhappiest Blow that befel that Nation in the whole Course of the War, who never after durst look our Fleet in the Face, and hereby left all their Sea-Coast to be insulted by us, as we pleased. I shall not enter into the Particulars of the Siege of Na∣mur, which was carried on with great Vigour, and which King William was no less sollicitous to relieve, resolving, if possible, to fight the Duke of Luxemburg, who covered the Siege, and who, upon Information that the King moved towards the River Mehaign, marched that way likewise; and upon the 8th of June the two Armies, which were very strong, and pretty equal as to number, the Confederates be∣ing reckon'd at 80000 Men, came in sight of one another, the River remaining between them. The Confederates pos∣sessed themselves of all the Posts upon the River on their side, as the French did of two Villages surrounded with strong Hedges and Thickets on theirs; but the Confede∣rates, by Planting of Batteries at all their Posts, were so far Masters of that River, that the French Soldiers could not come for a drop of Water to it: And that same Evening the King gave Orders to build Bridges over the Mehaign, in order to pass it the next day to attack the Enemy, which was so ordered, that the whole Army might pass in a Front at the same time; but the great Rains that begun that Evening, and held on for several days, that it broke the Bridges, made it unpassable for the Cannon, and rendred this glorious Undertaking abortive; the Consequence where∣of was the Surrender of the Castle of Namur on the 30th of June, (for the Town had been given up before) which, con∣sidering the Strength and Importance of the Place, with the shortness of the Siege, made most People believe there was some fellow-feeling in the Case. However it were, some did then report, who pretended to understand the Affairs of the Court of Brussels, That the King had desired the Ele∣ctor of Bavaria to withdraw the Prince of Brabason from his Government of Namur, and gave him his Reasons for it;
and that it was thereupon agreed the Prince should make the Campaign with the Elector: And this went on so far, that the Prince was at Brussels in order to it. But the French threatning to sit down before Namur, before the opening of the Campaign, on the Elector's side, he could not refuse his going to his Government, when the Prince desired it, lest he should discover the Mistrust he had of him. However, the Elector at the same time ordered the Count de Thian to accompany him in this Siege, and gave him some parti∣cular Instructions therein. The King's Camp was at Melle when Namur was given up, where he formed a Design to surprize Mons, and was very near being executed; when the Enemy having Information of it,Namur sur∣rendred. took care of their own Preservation. From Melle the Army march'd to Genap, thence to Notredame de Hall, and on the first of August passed the River Senne in several Co∣lumns, when they were joined by the Hanover Troops, to the number of 8000, all fine Men. The French encamped at the same time at Engheim, with their Right extended to Steenkirk, and where the King resolved to attack them. In the Evening Orders were given out for 6 Battalions to be ready to march an hour before day,The Battle of Steenkirk. and to parade at the Head of Prince Waldeck's Regiment. The Battalions were, the 2d of the 1st Regiment of Guards, the 1st of Sir Robert Douglass's, Col. Fitz-Patrick, Col. O Farrel's, a Battalion of the Danish Guards, and the Queens. Orders were likewise given for 17 Men in each Battalion in Churchil's Brigrade to be ready at the Time and Place, and to be commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Manwayring, their business being to make the Ways through the Desiles; they were all to receive a Ducat a Head for their Labour; and as they were to join with the Van-guard in time of business, they carried their Arms with them as well as Hatchets and Spades. All this Detachment was to be commanded by the Duke of Wirtem∣berg, as the Van-guard of our Army. Orders were likewise given for the whole Army to march very early in the Morn∣ing the General to beat at break of Day, and the Army to be ready at Sun-rising. All these Preparations were in order to attack the French the next day in their own Camp at Enghein, who the same Day as we march'd from Gennap to Hall, decamp'd from Soignes, and made all haste to Eng∣hein, lest we should get that Ground from them, and thus oblige them to get farther to their own Conquests; Luxem∣burg's Right being at Steenkirk, and his Left at Enghein, he took his Quarters at Hove. According to Orders, the 6 Battalions paraded at the Head of Prince Waldeck's Regiment, and the Detachment of 17 Men per Battalion of Churchil's Brigade, and received the
Command of Prince Wirtemberg; and very early in the Morning the whole Army followed them, makign their way to the Enemies Camp thro' nothing but Defiles, being close Ground all the way, and no other way but such as was made by our Detachment for that purpose; the Baggage being left behind, by order, at the Camp at Hall. About 9 or 10 in the Morning our Van-guard came to the advanced Posts of the Enemy, the Mareschal of Luxemburg (as the Pa∣ris Account gives it) having been informed of our Design by Monsieur Tracey (who commanded a Detachment of Horse that Night between the Enemies Camp and Ours) had ta∣ken care to possess himself of the most considerable Posts in the Defiles; But notwithstanding this, our Van-guard oblig'd the Enemy to retreat from them all, till they came to a little Wood, just upon the Right of the Enemies Camp, ex∣cept a small Guard in a Village upon the Left of our Co∣lumns, almost a League from the Enemies Camp, who, up∣on the march of our Army, were all made Prisoners of War, their number being about 30 Men and an Officer. Between 10 and 11 in the Morning, our advanc'd Guards under the Command of the Prince of Wirtemberg lodged themselves in the Wood that fronted the Right of the Ene∣mies Army; the Danes and the Battalion of Guards taking their Post upon the Left in the Wood, and Sir Robert Douglas, Fitz-patrick's, and O Farrel's upon the Right of them. On the other side of the Wood was the Enemies Camp, a little Valley remaining between, and a great many Hedges, which the Enemy resolved to maintain with all Vigour possible, tho' they yielded so easily their advanced Posts. Prince Wirtemberg, planted upon a little Rising on the Left of the Wood, a Battery of Cannon, which began to play about 11, and another upon the Right by Sir Robert Douglas his Battalion, Captain Macrackan of the same Regiment, who af∣terwards was killed, pointed a Cannon from his Battery so successfully, that it put a whole Battalion of the Enemies in disorder, sweeping almost an entire Rank before it. Whilst Prince Wirtemberg was playing upon the Enemy with these Batteries of Cannon, the Army marched up to the Head of the Defile (about half an English Mile from the Wood) where it opened in a little Plain upon our Right, not above half a League over, which terminated upon the Right of the Wood, where our Van-guard was, and at the Right of our Army, upon several Rows of high Trees, which seem∣ed planted in great order, as if 'twas the Avenue of some Person of Quality's House, which being towards Enghein, makes my Author suppose that they might belong to the Duke of Arschot's House, where those famous Gardens be, as are said to be the Pattern of Versailles. Thro' these, strait
before us, on the other side of the Plain, they could see the French Infantry drawn up in two Lines, and making to∣wards their Right to defend the Post upon the Wood. Upon the Right of this Plain, not far from these Groves and Rows of Trees, there was a pretty considerable Farm, which soon after the Engagement was set on fire by the Enemy, to cover (as 'tis said) several of their Battalions by the Smoak, who were ordered this way, and was after∣wards engag'd with Fagl's Brigade, between this House and the Wood, where our advanc'd Guard was posted. From the Head of our Defile, upon the Left of the Plain, there went for almost half a Mile in length, a deep hallow way with high Trees and Hedges upon the Banks of it, which reach'd as far as the Wood, where the Van-guard was post∣ed, and where it branched it self in 2 other deep ways, one going thro' the Wood upon the Left to the Danes Attack, and to that of the Guards; one almost streight forwards, and the other upon the right going along the out-side of the Wood; between these two last, was the Place where Sir Ro∣bert Douglas, Col. Fitz-patrick's, and O Farrel's Regiments were posted. On the other side of the deep Way as went from the Head of our Defile to the Post, where was our Van-guard, went several narrow Fields, which lay between it all along, and a part of the Wood which reach'd as far as our advanc'd Guards to our Defiles. When the Army was come up to the Head of these De∣files, and just entring into the small Plains, they were order∣ed to halt, except the English Life-guards, and Horse and Dragoons, which were commanded upon the Right Skirts of the Wood, where was our Van-guard, and my Lord Cutts's, Lieutenant-General Mackay's, Sir Charles Graham's, and Earl of Angus's Regiments, which being interlin'd with the English Horse, were commanded at the same time to the out-side of the Wood, on this side of that way as branch'd upon the Right, which made the Figure of the Arch of a Circle, as the Skirts of the Wood did here before us. These 4 Regiments were posted here, to be ready to second the Attack of our Van-guard. Prince of Hesse's, Col. Louder's, and Earl of Leven's Regiments, who were also interlin'd with the Left Wing of Horse, were likewise posted upon the side of the Wood. Things being thus dispos'd, and our Army continuing in their Halt, Prince Wirtemberg, after he had connonaded for above 2 Hours, begun the Attack with the Danes upon the Right, which was immediately follow'd by the other 4 English Regiments as compos'd our Van-guard, and seconded by Cutts, Mackay, Angus, Graham, Lauder, the Prince of Hesse, and Leven's Regiments. Certainly never was a more dreadful, and at the same time bolder firing
heard, which for the space of 2 Hours seem'd to be a con∣tinued Thunder, and equalled the noise, even of the loudest Claps; our Van-guard behaved themselves in this Engage∣ment to such wonder and admiration, that tho' they re∣ceived the Charge of several Battalions of the Enemies, one after another, yet they made them retreat almost into their very Camp, so far, that the second Battalion of the first Re∣giment of Guards possess'd themselves of a Battery of the Enemies Cannon, which the Enemy were oblig'd to quit by the Vigour of our Charge; and Colonel Wacup, who com∣manded the Battalion, and who behav'd himself extreamly well on this Occasion, plac'd a Serjeant and Guard upon it; but the French having cut off the Traces, and taken away the Horses, we could not bring them off, but were obliged afterwards to leave them. Sir R. Douglas with his first Bat∣talion, charg'd several of the Enemies, and beat them from 3 several Hedges, and had made himself Master of the 4th, where going thro' a Gap to get on the other side, he was unfortunately killed upon the Spot; all the other Regiments performing equal Wonder, and behaved themselves with the same Bravery, and beating the Enemies from the Hedges so far, that in this Hedge-fighting, their firing was generally Muzzle to Muzzle, we on the one side, and the Enemy on the other. But to return to our Army: As soon as they were come to the Head of the Defile, it was order'd to halt, particular∣ly our Left Wing of Horse, that the Foot that were inter∣lin'd with them, which were most English and Scotch, and which I have before mentioned, might march up thro' the Horse; they were obliged to this Halt, tho' it was the loss of the day; because the Ground was so streight, and the Enemy had such Hedges, Copses, and little Woods to co∣ver them, that there was nothing to do for the Horse; So that when the Van-guard began to engage, they had none but part of the Infantry interlined with the Left Wing of Horse, to second them, the Body of the Infantry being almost a Mile in the Rear. However, as soon as the Action began, the King made all diligence possible to get the Infantry up, ordering a Brigade to march up to the Wood, and forming a Line of Battel in the Plain with that Infantry as could come up. The Soldiers shewed such eagerness to come to the Ene∣my, that they ran to the Relief of those that were engaged, even so fast, that they put themselves into some disorder, which was the Reason that they took more time to form their Battalions, than was at that time convenient: This was the Case of those Battalions that were sent to the Wood to the Relief of our Van-guard; so that when they came up, our Van-guard and Infantry of the Left Wing being over-power∣ed
by the vast many Battalions of the Enemy, as charged them successively one after another; and lastly, by the sur∣vening of Boufflers's fresh Troops, they were forced to re∣treat in great Disorder, and to leave the Wood, in which they had lodged themselves, entirely to the Enemies Pos∣session. The Baron of Pibrack's Regiment of Lunemburgers being in great Disorder in the Skirt of the Wood, and the Baron their Colonel lying dangerously wounded upon the Place, (which he got in rallying of his Regiment) the Earl of Bath's (one of the Regiments that was commanded to∣wards the Wood, the other English being Brigadier Churchil's) was ordered by Prince Casimir of Nassau to their Relief; two Sergeants of this Regiment rescued the Colonel who lay wounded almost in the Enemies Hand, and brought him off in spite of their Fire. Upon these Orders of Prince Ca∣simir of Nassau, Sir Bevil Granville, who commanded the Earl of Bath's Regiment, march'd up to the Relief of this Lunemburg Regiment, bearing the Enemies Fire, before he suffered any Plattoon of his Battalion to discharge once; by which Method the Regiment lodg'd it self in the Trench, or deep Way that lay upon the Skirt of the Wood, which it maintain'd, till it was commanded off again by the said Prince of Nassau. The King having formed a Line of as many Battalions as could come up in this little Plain, the Enemy upon their Right, and our Left of the Wood, as we fac'd, planted a Battery of about 10 Pieces of Cannon to put them in dis∣order by their Fire, we at the same time brought another against it, and thus continued firing one upon another a considerable time. What Mischief our Men did to the Ene∣my by our Cannon then, I cannot tell, but theirs killed se∣veral of our Soldiers, some in the Regiment of Fuzileers, and some in the Battalion of the second Regiment of Guards, but the most considerable Loss we sustained by it, was Col. Hodges, who was shot with a Cannon-ball at the Head of his Regiment, of which he soon after died. There was like∣wise a Skirmish between some of the French, and some of our Battalions, between the Wood and that Farm which was fired by the Enemy, but it did not last long; what Regi∣ments they were I cannot tell; but 'tis supposed they were some of the Dutch interlined in the Left Wing of Horse, commanded by Brigadier Fagel. The Van-guard being thus disordered for want of a timely Relief, which was occasioned by the narrowness of the Ground, and consequently beaten out of their Post in the Wood, Luxemburg being likewise join'd by the Marquess of Boufflers's fresh Troops, who came ime enough to compleat the Defeat of our Van-guard with his Dragoons; and besides, the Night drawing on, the King
ordered his Army to retreat, which was done with admira∣ble Order; for tho' the French did follow us for some time, yet they did not fire a Shot, such was the Order of our Re∣treat, that they did not dare venture upon it. The English Granadiers brought up the Rear, and when-ever the French moved towards us, they fac'd to the Right about, and pre∣sented themselves to the Enemy, then the Enemy would halt, and so our Rear-guard marched on: This halting and facing, and then marching, continued for some time, till the Night put an end to the Enemies farther Motion. And thus the Army came back to Hall on Monday Morning about Three. We lost in this Action several Pieces of Cannon, some ta∣ken by the Enemy, and some we could not bring off, the Horses being tired; we likewise blew up some of our Pow∣der-Waggons in the Retreat, which we could not bring off, some having their Carriages broken, and others their Hor∣ses tired. The English lost two Colours, and the Dutch likewise some. We had about 2000 Men killed, and about 3000 wounded, in which number we comprehend the Priso∣ners taken by the French, disabled by their Wounds to come off, being about 8 or 900. Here it was that brave General Mackay, Sir John Lanier, and divers other gallant Officers lost their Lives: and surely the French, notwithstanding their Te Deum, for this pretend∣ed Victory, had nothing to boast of, since their Loss, ac∣cording to the Confession of divers of their Officers, rather exceeded that of the Confederates; and they had not come of so cheap neither, had it not been for the Chevalier de Millevoix, one of the Elector's Domesticks, his having given, and endeavoured to give further Intelligence to the Mares∣chal de Luxemburg of the King's Motion and Designs; for which he was fairly hanged upon a Tree on the Right Wing of Horse. And now this Business is over, it is time we should come to the Particulars of Granvalle's forementioned Conspiracy, as published in that time by Authority, and it was briefly thus. Upon the 11th of Aug. the Sieur de Granvale was brought to his Tryal before a Court Martial at Lembeck for the hor∣rid Conspiracy, by him entred into against the Life of his Majesty of Great Britain. Where it appeared by Informa∣tions, intercepted Letters, and other Authentick Pieces, that some of the greatest Ministers in the French Court had laid a Design to assassinate his Majesty of Great Britain, and made Choice of Bartholomew Liniere, Sieur de Granvale for their Instrument to manage the Enterprize, and find out fit Persons to assist him. To this purpose, Granvale understand∣ing that one Anthony du Mont had been formerly engag'd in
the same design by the Marquess of Louvois, when he was living, propos'd it to him again by the order of the Mar∣quess of Barbesieux, the Son of Louvois; upon which several Projects were drawn up, and several Conferences held to have brought it to pass the last Campaign, 1691. But be∣ing then disappointed, they still went on with their Design. Granvale being employed to write to du Mont, then retir'd to Hanover, and encourage him to a second Attempt this present Campaign. Soon after Granvale discover'd his De∣signs to one Leefdale at Paris, who seem'd willingly to com∣ply with him, but gave notice of it to his Friends in Hol∣land, that they might inform his Majesty, as du Mont had done to the Duke of Zell, who acquainted the King with it. But Granvale knowing nothing of all this, departs from Paris with Leefdale, gives du Mont a Meeting at Vden in Ra∣vestein, having in his way at Brussels, imparted his Design to one John d' Amours, and coming to Einchoven, was there seiz∣ed and carried to Bois le Duc with his Companions. Leefdale being first examined, declared all the Circumstan∣ces of the Conspiracy; Granvale's sending du Mont 200 Pi∣stols the last Winter to keep him steady; and 10 Duckets from Brussels by Bill of Exchange. John d' Amours depos'd, That Granvale told him at Brus∣sels, he had a great Business to do, and being asked what it was, and whether he had any thing to say to the King of England, he replied, To break his Neck; and that being warn'd of the Difficulties of the Attempt, he answer'd, That he had given his Word to the Marquess of Barbesieux, and would do it; and that he went into the Jesuits Church at Brussels, to say a Pater Noster, that God would bless his Un∣dertaking. Du Mont upon his Examination, own'd the Mat∣ter of Fact in every Circumstance; adding withal, That Ma∣dam Maintenon was acquainted with the Design; and that he acquainted Monsieur Bedal, the King of France's Minister at Hanover with it, who told him it would be a good Busi∣ness if it could be done, and lent him 50 Crowns for his Encouragement. Granvale was the last examined, who find∣ing the Business discovered, and his own Letters ready to be produced against him, confessed all the Circumstances of the Design. Upon this, Granvale was carried to the Army and put upon his Tryal; upon which the Evidence appeared so clear, that Granvale himself confess'd so much without nam∣ing the Rack, that after the Judges had met several times, they at last gave Sentence: That whereas Bartholomew de Liniere, Sieur de Granvale, a Native of Picardy, had confessed before the Court Martial without any Constraint; And it farther appeareth, that the Marquess of Louvois, late Secretary to the King of France,
had agreed with du Mont about the Murder of King Wil∣liam, upon which the said du Mont presented the Marquess with a Draught of the manner how it might be done. That upon the Death of Louvois, his Son, and Secretary also to the French King, the Marquess of Barbesieux, revived the said Conspiracy with du Mont, and paid him 30 Pistols, which his Father had order'd in his Life-time. That the Prisoner came acquainted with du Mont at Monsieur Rebenac's House, where Monsieur Paparel saying, That du Mont would be a fit Person to carry off the King, du Mont replied with Execrations, That he would carry off the King alive or dead, as he had promised Louvois. That du Mont having delivered the same or another Project to Barbesieux, the Prisoner, to prompt the Design, had had several Conferences with Barbe∣sieux and Paparel; and being told, That he should inform du Mont, that the King of Great Britain wore a Coat of Mail, with which he acquainted du Mont, du Mont reply'd; 'Twas no matter, he would kill him for all that. That the Prisoner was engaged with one Parker, a Colonel to the late King James, to execute the same Design; and that the said Parker told him, he had laid the same Design with the Mar∣quess of Louvois. That the Prisoner, with the said Barbe∣sieux, Paparel, Parker, and du Mont, did agree upon the man∣ner of executing the Design, viz. That he and Parker should meet at the grand Guard of the Duke of Luxemburg, who was to furnish him with 1500 Horse, that du Mont was to watch when the King of England went to Visit the main Guard, and there shoot him, and that the Prisoner and Par∣ker was to bring him off with the 1500 Horse; and that Barbesieux gave the Prisoner an Order to the Duke of Lux∣emburg to supply him with such a Detachment as he should think requisite for the design. That the Prisoner by Order of Barbesieux received 80 Louidores from Paparel, and by Barbesieux's Directions gave du Mont 55 out of the Summ. That Barbesieux promised the Prisoner an Annual Revenue of 20000 Livres, and to make him a Knight of the Order of St. Lazarus, in case the design took Effect. That the Priso∣ner took some measures in order to the design with Mon∣sieur Chamlays, Quarter-Master General to the French King. That in the mean time, Leefdale came acquainted with the Prisoner by the means of one Sterck, and discover'd his de∣sign to him toward the latter end of March, 1692; and af∣terwards carried him to Barbesieux and Chamlays, who told Leefdale, in the Prisoners hearing, That he should have a great Reward if the Business succeeded; and that Barbesieux and Paparel both knew of the Reward which was promised. That the Prisoner, together with Leefdale and Parker, went to St. Germains, April 16. 1692. to speak with the late King
James about the design, who knew of it before; And that the Prisoner spake with the late King, the late Queen being present; at which time King James told him, That Parker had acquainted him with the Business, adding this farther, If you and the rest do me this Service, you shall never want. That du Mont's Wife delivered several Letters to Barbesieux, which she receiv'd from her Husband at Hanover; where the Prisoner continuing his Correspondence with him, engaged him by Letters of April 20, 25. and 12 of May, to meet him at Vden in order to take their final Resolution. That the Prisoner with Chamlays and Leefdale agreed upon the man∣ner of perpetrating the Assassination; That when the King should pass along the Lines, or ride out to take a View, or when the Army should decamp, that du Mont should lie in Ambush, and when the King came within 100 Paces, he should fire upon him; And that Chamlays should be ready with 3000 Horse to bring him off. That the Prisoner and Leefdale left Paris the 17th of April last, and arrived at Mons within a few days after, where they waited for Chamlays; but he not coming, they resolved to set forward to the place of the general Meeting; after which, the Prisoner with Leef∣dale were apprehended at Einhoven. All which being ma∣turely examin'd and consider'd, the Court Martial adjudg'd the Prisoner Guilty, and condemned him to be drawn, hang'd and quarter'd, his Estate to be confiscate, and to bear the Costs and Charges of the Tryal. Which Sentence was pro∣nounced in the Head Quarters of the Army, by the Earl of Athlone, President, Gen. Van Scravenmore, Lieutenant Gen. Talmash, the Marquess de la Forrest, the Heer Van Weed, Count Noyelles, and the Heer Zobel, Major-Generals, the Brigadiers Churchill and Ramsey, Cornelius van Won, and Richard Elhwair, Judge Advocates assisting. In pursuance of which Sentence, the Criminal was executed in the Camp upon the 13th of Aug. Where all that he said for himself was only to desire the Prayers of those that were present. During his Impri∣sonment, he drew up two Petitions to the King with his own Hand; wherein he declared, That he acted in the Design, in obedience to the Orders of M. Barbesieux and Chamlays; and being told that Barbesieux would be sure to disown what he said, he replied, That he had an Original Paper under Barbesieux's own Hand, which he had lodged in a Friend's Hand, which would make it appear very plain; but that his Friend would part with it to no body but him∣self. The Morning before his Execution, he wrote to one Madam Jure, to go to the Arch-bishop of Rheims, with M. Jurduil, and let him know, that it had cost him his Life; for obeying the Orders of M. Barbesieux.
There being little more this Campaign in the Netherlands, save the Action of Slen (where the Governour of Huy, sur∣prizing a strong Party of French, that came thither from Namur to cut Pallisadoes, he made a great Slaughter of them, and took near  Prisoners) and the Bombing of Charleroy, by the Mareschal de Boufflers; We will leave his Majesty to return to his Diversion at Loo, and call to mind, that when the French was threatning to invade England, we mention'd a Camp to be formed near Portsmouth, with which the Queen and Council, upon the beating of the French Fleet, projected to make a Descent upon the French Coast, or at least to alarm them on that side; in pursuance to which, the Men of War and Transports being ready, the Forces im∣bark'd under the Command of the Duke of Leinster,The English Forces im∣bark. Aug. 3d, and two days after set Sail with a fair Wind, and when they came to such an height of Distance, the Commissions were opened according to Custom, but Mens Expectations were not so great from this Expedition, as their Surprize was, that Intilligence came in 4 or 5 Days after, That all the Transport Ships were put into St. Hellen's Road. On the 9th a Council of War was held on Board the General, where it was resolved, they should return for England, which they did accordingly; and this gave the Queen occasion to send divers Lords of the Council to Portsmouth to confer with the General; but whatever was then resolved on, the Forces still remained on Board, and the Wind proved contrary, which the King being informed of,English For∣ces  in Flanders. he sent Orders they should be transported forthwith into Flanders, where they landed Sept. 1st, and tho' the Duke of Luxemburg seemed to be aware of it, yet they possessed themselves of Dixmude and Furnes, which they began to fortifie, and by which the King seemed to have some great Design that way, but all miscarried, for both Places were quitted towards the end of the Year to the Mareschal de Boufflers, by Count Horn, which the King much resented in him, who till now always had a great share in his Esteem, and perhaps the same touch'd the Count very near, for he did not live long after. Thus things went in Flanders with the Spaniards this Cam∣paign, who perhaps were the more contented with it, be∣cause it was but like Thunder a-far off; and the mighty Ef∣forts France made this Way, gave them the more repose in Catalonia, where they had but a small force, and where no∣thing passed of Moment, and therefore we shall move to the Vpper Rhine, where the Margrave of Bareith, and Landgrave of Hess-Cassel commanded the Forces on that side against the Duke de Lorge, General of the French Army.The Cam∣paign on  the  Rhine. Between them there passed nothing considerable till Sept. when de Lorge advancing towards the Rhine with all his Forces, and 40
Pieces of Cannon, the Landgrave and Margrave of Bareith called a Council of War with the rest of the Generals, where it was resolved that the two Armies that were sepa∣rated, should re-join, which was done accordingly, and the Army encamped near Neustadt, and in some days after sepa∣rated again, the Landgrave marching to besiege Eberemburgh; where he had not been gone long, but Bareith sent him an Express, That de Lorge was marching up, which made the Landgrave send away 4000 Dragoons to the other's Assist∣ance: But before they and the Body of the Army could come up, the Duke of Wirtemburg, who was gone before with a Detachment of about 4000 Horse, and posted himself near Edeilsheim, with a design to stop the French, was, by the favour of a thick og, surprized by the French in his Camp, and charged so briskly, that the Germans had not time to put themselves in a posture of Defence; so that they lost of their number near a 1000 Men, and divers Prisoners, among whom the Duke of Wirtemburg himself was one, who was carried to Paris, while the French ravaged his Country for a time at their Pleasure, and obliged the Landgrave, now weakned by the Detachment he had sent away to the Margrave of Bareith, and afterwards by another to secure Heidelburgh, to raise the Siege of Eberemburgh: But for this, the Landgrave was pretty even with the French before the end of the Year,The Siege of Reinfld. for the latter having besieged Rheinfeld, which would have been of great Importance to them if they could have carried it, the Governour made so brave a De∣fence, and the Landgrave made such haste to relieve it, that the French were constrained to raise the Siege with some dis∣honour, since they shewed so much Confidence of Success in it at the first Undertaking, and with no less loss from the Germans Fire, and the rigorous Season, which was much fit∣ter for warm Quarters than cold Sieges. Having now run through the Efforts made by France on the Flemish and German side, it's time we should see what was doing in respect to Savoy all this while. It's certain, there were fresh Proposals made to the Duke early in the Year by M. Chanley in favour of France,The Duke of Savoy in∣vades the Daupbinate, and his Pro∣gress. but whether in the form that was afterwards made publick, is a Mystery; however, there was a Memoir printed at Paris, wherein they set to View all the Proffers that had been made to the Duke, tho' the Aim of the Writing seem'd chiefly to insinuate into the Princes of Italy, that the Emperor had no other design, than to make himself Master of their Territories, under retence of assisting a Prince, that had thrown himself into that Abyss, wherein he found him precipitated, with a great deal more to the same purpose: But the German Troops now in Italy were too numerous to give any of the Princes an Opportu∣nity
to disturb them, had they been so minded; and the Duke of Savoy was yet too stanch to go back from his Obli∣gations to his Allies, and therefore he appeared to carry on this Campaign with more Vigour and Success than at any time before; but the truth on't was, the French were so strong in Germany and Flanders, that all they desired to do now in I∣taly, was to defend their Posts, which they could not do nei∣ther: For the Duke having got his Army into the Field, and disposed of several Detachments into the Vallies and other places for the better security of the Country; he march'd in the Month of July at the Head of 20000 Men into the Dau∣phinate, where, after they had pillaged la Roche, Chantelouve, and some other Villages, they made themselves Masters of the Castle and Highlands of Guillestre, and some other Passes; and from thence moved towards the City of Ambrun, which being surrendred upon Articles, the Day after having been invested, on the 5th of Aug.; All the Army crossed the Du∣rance at Guilestre, and after a pretty brisk Siege of about 9 Days, was surrendred upon Articles. There the Duke found 20 Pieces of Cannon, and a Quantity of Provisions; and the City presently granted to his Highness 40000 Livres Contri∣bution, which they borrowed at Grenoble, for that purpose, besides which, his Highness seiz'd upon 60000 Livres in Gold, which was the King's Mony in the Hands of the Treasurer of the Troops; all the Ambrunois, with the Neighbouring Towns and Villages were at the same time put under Con∣tribution. From Ambrun the Army marched directly to Gap, a City upon the Frontiers of Provence; before which Prince Eugine no sooner appeared, but it surrendred, and became under the same Obligations of Contribution as the other places; but tho' the Consternation on that side of France was incredible at this sudden Irruption, and that the parts where the Duke's Army came, were sufficiently desolated, especi∣ally by the Germans, who are very good at Lextalionis, and who, to make themselves Satisfaction for the French Hostili∣ties committed in the Palatinate, utterly ruined all the places they came near, so that upon Computation, there was no less than 80 Castles, Boroughs, Towns, and Villages burnt by them; yet the Duke's falling sick of the Small Pox, and the Division among the Generals,The Duke of Savoy's Sckness. hindered the design that had been formed, of taking Brianson and Quieras, to be put in Execution, and so did incapacitate them to keep what had been conquer'd in the Dauphinate: However to make the best of a bad Market, they plundered the Country, destroy'd all the Provisions they could not carry away, got what Contri∣butions they could, burnt all that refused to contribute, ex∣cept Ambrun, whose Fortifications they blew up, and took Mony, to save the Houses, and so put an end to the Cam∣paign
alamode de France. But it had like to have proved fa∣tal to the Duke, for after he was pretty well recovered of the Small Pox, he fell into an Ague which so rudely handled him, that most Men despaired of his Recovery,The Duke recovers. but at length his Youthful Constitution overcame it. Now it's time we should take a turn into Hungary, where it will be found, that the Proceedings of this Campaign did not prove answerable to the Success of the last. One-should think, that after such an overthrow as that of Salankemen, the Turks should neither be able to bring any considerable Force into the Field, and that the Germans could do no less than take their former Road towards Nissa or Widin, that leads to Constantinople, but neither of the two hapned, tho' the ad∣vantage remained still on the Emperors side; but it was more owing to good Management, than the number of his Army. Great Waradin had been block'd up in a manner for some Years,Great Wa∣radin be∣sieged. but now the Imperial Court considering of what con∣sequence it would be for them to become Masters of that Fortress before the Turks could take the Field, resolved to be∣siege it in form, and the brave General Heusler was deputed to command there, who arriving before the place about the end of April, push'd on the Siege with great Vigour, but more especially from the 21st of May to the 30th he threw in an infinite number of Bombs, and the said Day, sprung a a Mine under the side of the Moat, where the Besiegers found also a way to lodge themselves, which made the General to send the Aga a theatning Summons, if he surrendred not: But his Answer was, That he resolved to perish in the De∣fence of the place, and that he would be the cause of many others perishing with him; with which the General was so incens'd, that he gave the Signal for Storming on the 2d of June. This made the Besieged hang out a white Flag, and beat a Parley,Great Wa∣radia sur∣rendered. and the Articles of Capitulation were agreed on, in pursuance to which, the Imperialists took possession of the place on the 5th, where they found but little Provisi∣on, but great store of Ammunition, with 77 Pieces of Can∣non, and 4 Mortars. This, I confess, was an important place, but fell far short of the taking of Belgrade, &c. which the Imperialists thought themselves Cock-sure of, before the Cam∣paign begun, neither was there any more done there, save the taking a little place called Pesabera, upon the Danube, whereby they might hinder Belgrade from being supply'd by Water, but this they were forced to quit when the Turkish Army came; so that the Prince of Baden made a very unactive Campaign of it. And if it was thus in Hurgary,Cnea be∣sieged by the . it was not much different with the Republick of Venice; its true, they made a fair At∣tempt towards the reducing of Cnea, in the Isle of Candi▪
once more under their Obedience, and to that end, about the 18th of July they laid Siege to it, and that with very promising hopes of Success in the Enterprize, and all the News for a time was, that the besieged were at a stand, and that the Bombs had so ruined the City, that it could hold out no longer, and that it was impossible to relieve it: But in all this they were mightily mistaken, for at a time when they least expected it, the Basha of Retino with the Turks under his Command, entrenched himself upon the rising Ground, from whence he not only greatly annoyed the Venetian Army, but found a way in little Barks to put Relief into the Town, which made such brisk Sallies upon the Christians,The Sige rais'd. that in a Council of War it was agreed to raise the Siege, and so they imbark'd all the Troops that remained (for they had suffered extreamly) with some difficulty, and sailed away to Napoli di Malvasia. This Disappointment, together with the Basha of Albania's making a great Incursion into the Venetian Ter∣ritories by the way of Zettina, made the Senate very uneasie, and towards the end of the Year to bethink themselves of a new Captain General, and this Trust and Honour they unani∣mously devolved on the serene Doge Morosini, who had for∣merly served the Republick so successfully, and which no∣thing now,The Pes do little. but his great Age, made him seem unwilling to accept of. As for the Polish Army, I think they made a shift to get into the Field by Sept. and in Oct. to block up Caminiec; and 'tis well, had they done that to purpose, for as to any thing else, they never went about it: And now having run thro' the several Transactions of Europe, it's time to close this Year with a few Particulars. About the beginning of the Year died the famous Robert Boyle,Mr. Boyle's Death. Esq who was a Philosopher under a particular Cha∣racter, as being addicted to the Study of Natural Philosophy, and perhaps never any Man dived so deep into the Knowledge of Nature, as himself; which yet was so far from being at∣tended in him, with that Atheism, that is too too usual for such speculative Heads, that he was always in his Life time esteemed a very pious Man, and sincere Christian, of which he gave a most convincing Testimony at his Death, by the Legacy he left to have a Monthly Sermon preached against Atheism. On the 7th of June hapned a most terrible Earthquake in the Island of Jamaca in the West-Indies,Earthquake in Jamaca and England. which did most prodi∣gious Damage, especially at the Town of Port-Royal, the best of all the English Plantations, and the greatest Mart in that part of the World, which was in a manner entirely ruined, and not only so, but 'twas computed, no less than 1500 People perished in it. And upon the 8th of Sept. following, about 2 a Clock we felt an Earthquake also in England, and
particularly in London, the like no Man living knew before, but blessed be God, it did no harm with us, nor upon the Continent, where it was felt in the same time and manner. On the 24th of Dec. died the most serene Electress of Ba∣varia at Vienna, in the 23d Year of her Age, after she had undergone several Discomposures from the 28th of Oct. when she was brought to bed of an Electoral Prince. This Year was also fatal to Prince Waldeck, Camp-Master-General to his Imperial Majesty and the States, and on whom the Emperor conferred the Dignity of a Prince, by reason of his Merit (for he was a Politick and Able as he was unfor∣tunate) and the Services he had done him in Hungary and other places, but the same died with him. Neither ought we to forget,Ninth Ele∣ctorate. that this Year the Duke of Hanover, a Protestant Prince, had been advanced to an Ele∣ctor of the Empire, and so a Ninth Electorate constituted thereby. It may be remembred, we left King William in the close of the Campaign going to his Diversions in Holland, from whence he returned into England, before whose Arrival, things were so managed in Ireland, by my Lord Sidney, Lord Lieu∣tenant of that Kingdom, that the Parliament there, made not only an Act of Recognition of their Majesty's title to that Crown, and another to get other Protestants to settle in that Kingdom, but one for an additional Duty of Excise upon Beer, Ale, and other Liquors for the Support of the Govern∣ment. And Scotland seemed very zealous and forward to contribute new Levies, or whatever else their Majesties de∣sired: And to be sure,The Pro∣ceedings of the English Parliament. the Parliament of England that had hitherto on all occasions been ready to promote the King's just designs, would not be behind-hand now, but took his Majesty's Speech so effectually into their Consideration, that before the end of Jan. they passed the Act of Granting to their Majesties an Aid of 4 s. in the Pound, for carrying on a vi∣gorous War against France, and soon after another, that grant∣ed certain Rates and Duties of Excise upon Beer, Ale, or other Liquors, for securing Recompences and Advantages, in the said Act mentioned, to such Persons as should voluntari∣ly advance 1000000 l. for the purposes declared in the Act▪ by paying into the Receipt of his Majesties Exchequer, the fore-mentioned Summ, before the 1st of May, 1693. upon the terms expressly mentioned in the said Act; neither did they stop their Hand here, but proceeded chearfully to other Methods for compleating the necessary Supplies, and by the 14th of March the King, among others, signed two Mony Acts more, viz. An Act for Granting to their Majesties, cer∣tain additional Impositions upon several Goods and Merchan∣dizes,
for prosecuting the present War with France, and an Act for a Review of the Quarterly Pole, granted to their Ma∣jesties the last Session of Parliament. After this the King made a Speech, to thank them for what they had done, to recommend the Publick Peace to them, and Equity in levy∣ing what they had so freely given; then prorogued the Houses to the 2d of May, and in the mean time went himself for Hol∣land. But before his Departure, did, by what Advice, I will not determine, lay aside Admiral Russel (who had beaten the French Fleet last Year, and received the Thanks of the House of Commons for it, whereof he was then a Member, but since made a Peer by the Stile and Title of Earl of Oxford, and last Year one of the Lords Justices of England) and consti∣tuted Henry Killigrew, Esq Sir Ralph Delavall, and Sir Clovesley Shovel to command the Fleet this Summer. The Fleet was numerous, and ready pretty early, as was al∣so a great Fleet of Merchant-men, near 400 Sail in all, of Eng∣lish, Dutch, Hamburgers, &c. prepared to sail to the Streights under the Convoy of Sir George Rook, with a strong Squadron of Men of War, with whom the grand Fleet was to keep company, till they came to such a Latitude, or as was given out in those times by some, till they had certain Information where the French Fleet was; Which made their Orders dis∣cretionary, and Sir George, who seemed to have some foresight of the Danger, exprest himself very loath to part with them: But however, seeing he could not help it, he sailed on; and leaving by the way the Vessels bound for Bilboa, Lisbon, Sr. Tubes, and other Ports under Convoy of 2 Men of War, which made Sir George have no more with him than 21 now; The account of his Expedition, as himself sent an Express of it was briefly thus: That indeed he had discovered the French Fleet about 20 Leagues short of Cape St. Vincent, which made him call a Council of War, wherein it was resolved, that the Wind being fresh Westerly, and giving a fair opportunity to hasten their Passage to Cadiz, the Merchants should make the best of their way;The Smyrna Fleet at∣tach'd' by the French. That upon the Discovery of the Ene∣mies whole Fleet upon the 16th, he brought too, and stood off with an easie Sail, to give what time he could to the heavy Sailors, to work away to the Windward, sending away the Sheerness to order the small Ships that were under the Shore, that they should endeavour to get along the Shore in the Night, into Faro, St. Lucar, or Cadiz; That about 6 in the Evening of the same Day, the French Admiral, and Vice-Admiral of the Blue came up with the Leeward and Sternmost of the Fleet, which were 2 or 3 Dutch Men of War, who, as we understood afterwards, fought first 11 and then 7 French Men of War, but were forced at last to yield, and the Cap∣tains being carried Aboard the French Admiral, he asked
Schrycer, who was one of them, and fought most desperately, whether he was a Man or a Devil, and treated them both very civilly. This made the Dutch Merchant-men that were there, tack for the Shore, and the Enemy after them, which gave a fair Opportunity to the Ships to Windward, and a head to make sail of; And this tacking after the Dutch, saved most of the Fleet; and the French accounts have exaggerated the loss we sustained mightily, which indeed was too much: But however it hapned with M. Tourville in the Management of this Affair, I am sure, if an English Admiral had had such an opportunity over the French, and made no better use of it, the Nation would never have forgiven him; for the loss in the utmost extent of it, was not reckoned above 32 Mer∣chant-men taken, and 27 burnt, and some of the former be∣long'd to Neutral Princes, and the greatest Loss that befel the English, was the sinking of 4 of the greatest Merchant-men in the Bay of Gibraltar, where it was hoped they were safe, whereas the Danes, Dutch, &c. that put in there for shelter, came off unhurt; and I have heard, the occasion was, that when a French Squadron came thither to bomb them, and one of the first Bombs that was shot, fell into one of these Eng∣lish Ships, this, tho' it did no considerable Damage, ye it so terrified the Commanders, that they could think of no way to save their Effects, but by losing them, as I have told you, tho' nothing is more apparent, than that the French might have shot a Thousand Bombs, and not one more alight∣ed in a Ship. Sir George Rook, upon this Disaster, with the Men of War and some Merchant-men, made the best of his way for Ireland, where he safely arrived, to the great Satis∣faction of the Nation, that things were no worse: But I must say, that Mens Tongues, I believe, were never looser against the State-ministry than now; but where the Blame particular∣ly lay, has been left in the dark to this Day. Having thus briefly passed over this ugly business,The Cam∣paign in Flander's. we shall now step into Flanders and see what is doing there. The French this Year were prodigious strong on that side, and by Computation of the Forces on each side, they exceeded the Confederates almost by one half at the beginning of the Campaign; but the King's Diligence to possess himself the Camp at Park, entirely broke the French King's Design upon Brabant, which made the latter send a strong Detach∣ment, under the Command of the Dauphine and the Ma∣reschal de Boufflers into Germany, and return himself to Ver∣sailles, without any manner of Attempt; which was matter much Discourse both in France and elsewhere. The French all this while were encamped at Meldert, whose Convo were much molested by the Garrison of Charleroy, yet seemed a Trial of Skill between both Armies, who should
continue longest in their Posts, which at length, on the 28th of July the French were forced to quit, marching to Hey∣lissem in their way towards the Meuse, which gave the King an opportunity to send a strong Detachment under the Com∣mand of the Duke of Wirtemberg, to force the French Lines in Flanders. While he was putting this in Execution, with very good Success, and that Count Tilly, General of the Troops of Leige, was marching with a Re-inforcement to join the King, Luxemburg being advertised of it, immediate∣ly posted away some Troops to hinder that Conjunction, who used that Celerity, that they in a manner surprized the Count in the hollow ways thro' which he was marching, and briskly charged such of his Troops as they could come at; but the Count making a Vertue of Necessity, ordered his Men not to engage, but to retreat as fast as they could, the French pursuing them as far almost as Maestrich, to whom they did no considerable Damage, save the taking of their Bag∣gage. However, this Success incouraged Monsieur Luxem∣burg to lay siege to Huy, which was invested on July 9th, and this made the King move nearer the Country of Liege:Huy taken by the French. But when he came to Tongres, he was surprized to hear the Castle of Huy had capitulated; which made him also, upon further Information that Monsieur Luxemburg was drawn near∣er Liege, send 10 Battalions thither, who with very great Difficulty got at length into the Place that now absolutely rejected the Neutrality Luxemburg offered; the Mareschal thereupon made as if he designed to attack it, but in reality concluded to attack the King now encamped at Neerhespen, so much weakened thro' the several Detachments he made to cover the places that seemed most in Danger, that it was generally computed, the French, at the time of the Engage∣ment, exceeded the Confederates at least 35000 Men. The King, to know the certainty of the Enemies Designs, before he went further off from the Meuse, sent out daily some Parties of Horse to get Intelligence of the Enemy; one of which returned, and gave him an Account, they could not go beyond Waren, because they met there with a great Par∣ty of French Horse; which indeed was the Left Wing of their Army upon the March, which made the King, the Elector, and other great Officers immediately to get on Horseback to inform themselves better: And in short, it was the King's own Observation by the Enemies Countenance, that 'twas the Vanguard of the whole French Army that was coming up to attack him in his own Camp; which made him immediately draw up the Army in Battali to expect the Enemy.
As soon as the Enemy drew up by our Camp, the King ordered Brigadier Ransey with his Brigade, then composed of 5 Battalions, viz. Offerrel, Mackay, Lauder, Leven, and Monroe, to the Right of all before our Right Wing of Horse, to guard some Hedges and hallow Ways which there covered our Right just upon the Right of the Village of Laer. The Brandenburg Battalions were posted at this Village, and to the Left of it, and more to the Left the Infantry of Hanover. Prince Charles of Brandenburg, as Major-General, command∣ed the 6 Battalions of Brandenburg, and Lieutenant-General du Mont the Hanover, with whom he was to defend the Vil∣lage of Neerwinden, that cover'd part of our Camp between the Right Wing of Horse and our main Body. These were afterwards reinforc'd by the first Battalion of the first Regi∣ment of Guards, and the second Battalion of Scotch Guards. Upon the Left at Neerlanden his Majesty order'd the first Bat∣talion of the Royal Regiment, Churchill's, Selwyn's, and Tre∣lawney's, Prince Frederick's Battalion of Danes, and Fagel's, to possess this Village that covered the Left of our Body of Foot, which upon the Enemies Approach wheeled from the Left to the Right, to bring up their Left to the Brook of Beck, where 'twas cover'd by this Village of Neerlanden. The Ground was open between Neerwinden and Neerlanden; whereupon his Majesty order'd a Retrenchment to be made in the Night from the one to the other, to cover our Body of Foot, which indeed was but a slight Breast-work, as a Man may judge by the time they had to make it, and the number of Men that worked about it, viz. 30 Men per Bat∣talion; and yet the French were pleased afterwards to mag∣nifie it with the Name of A formidable Retrenchment, and what not. Now the Remainder of the Body of Foot was drawn up in one Line within the Retrenchment to defend it; and the Dragoons upon the Left were ordered to the Village of Dormal to guard that pass upon the Brook of Beck; and from thence the Left Wing of Horse reached to Neer∣landen, where 'twas covered by this Brook, and from thence turned off to the Right behind the Body of Foot. However it were (it was reported) Luxemburg, upon his Viewing of the Camp that Evening, should observe some Deficiency in it, and say, Now he believed Waldeck was dead, who was known to be perhaps the best Man for Encamping in the World. The King who had been on Horseback till late in the Even∣ing, not only to give all the necessary Orders, but to see the Execution of them, ordered his Coach at last to be brought to the Rear of Stanley's Regiment, where he repo∣sed himself about two Hours; and early in the Morning sent for Doctor Menard, one of his Chaplains, into the Coach to pray with him, suitable to the Occasion; a rare Example and worthy of Imitation by all, but especially of Military Men, who carry their Lives in their Hands, but more is the
pitty, have usually the least Concern of any for a future State; which was no sooner done, but all things were dis∣posed for Action. It was the 19th day of July this mighty Battel was fought, which will be talked of in all future Ge∣nerations, and of which take the following Account. By Sun-rising the French were drawn up within Cannon-shot of the Confederates Camp,The Battle of Landen▪ who plaid upon them with their Cannon with good Success; and this the French re∣ceived with admirable Constancy, till about 6 they made a Movement to come nearer the King's Retrenchments, and about 8, Luxemburg ordered a strong Body of Troops to at∣tack the Villages of Lar or Neerwinden, which they did with great Fury, and various Success, having gained and lost those Posts once and again; But at length the Confederates, tho' much inferiour in number, remained Masters of them: And here it was the Duke of Berwick was taken Prisoner. But this ill Success of the French upon the Confederates Right, did not discourage them from Attacking the Confe∣derates Left Wing at Neerlanden; which Post, tho' it was not in it self weak; yet it was attacked with a great Dis∣proportion of Forces; and the Fire was very smart on both sides, the French gained and lost the Advantage several times; but were at last, after two Hours hot Dispute, en∣tirely beaten: His Majesty's Example and Presence, as be∣ing there in Person, mightily heartning the Confederates to stand stoutly to it; and hitherto the Success of the day was manifestly on the Confederates side, and the French seemed by their Countenance, as if they designed to draw off: But Luxemburg having still several Brigades of fresh Men, re∣solved to gain the Village of Neerwinden a second time; and to that end, attacked it with great Fury, and here the Dispute lasted a long time; His Majesty doing the Office of a private Soldier, as well as a grand Captain, at the same time; as did also the Elector of Bavaria, who distinguish∣ed himself upon this Occasion, by several Repulses he gave the Enemy: And in short, nothing but Numbers prevailed over the Confederates, who, together with the Field of Bat∣tel whereon his Majesty staid rallying some Horse, till he was almost surrounded, lost most of their Cannon, and re∣treated to Lewe unpursued by the French, who, tho' they gained the Battel, yet their Loss was such, that they might very well say with Pyrrhus King of Epirus, when compliment∣ed upon his Success against the Romans, That such another Bat∣tel would quite Ruin them. The King in the Day of Battel shewed himself, as he had always done, a brave Man; and it was only the wonderful Providence of God that preserved one that exposed himself so much as he did, who narrowly escaped 3 Musket-shots,
one through his Perwig, which made him deaf for a while; another through the Sleeve of his Coat, which did no harm; and the third carried off the Knot of his Scarf, and left a small Contusion on his Side; and in short, his Majesty this day gained so far the Respect and Admiration of his Ene∣mies, that 'twas a common Saying among them, That they wanted but such a King to make them Masters of Christendom. And the Prince of Conti, in his intercepted Letter to the Princess his Wife, said, He saw the King every where present, where there was any Action, exposing his Person to the greatest Dangers; and that surely so much Valour very well deserved the peaceable Possession of the Crown he wore. It would be an endless thing to enter into the Dispute about the Loss in this Bat∣tel on each side; the Confederates indeed thought theirs at first much greater than afterward upon a Review it did appear, when they missed not above 5 or 6000 fighting Men, killed, wounded and taken Prisoners; whereas the French would have them to be no less than 20000, and theirs 2000 killed: But here the Confederates might justly turn the Tables; For it is past all doubt the French had above the number of 2000 Officers killed and wounded; and if the Allies did somewhat exaggerate the Loss of the French, in computing it at about 18000, yet surely Luxemburg's not pursuing them at all upon the Retreat, and his continuing for 15 days together at Waren, without making the least Attempt, gave a considerable Reputation to what they said. But for their Cannon and Mortars, the Confederates must be content to own they lost the greatest part of them. How∣ever, the French, to give some Reputation to their Asser∣tions, in what they said in relation to the Battel, did at last resolve to besiege Charleroy, which they invested on the 31st of Aug. after they had been reinforced with the Troops from the Sea-Coast, and a great Detachment, under Boufflers, from the Rhine, which confirmed still their Loss as aforesaid. It is not my purpose to give a Journal of the Siege, it's e∣nough to say, That the French, with these new Reinforce∣ments attacked the Place with great Fury, which was as well defended by the Besieged, that tho' they had little or no prospect of Relief, yet they gallantly held it out till the 1st of Oct. and then made an honourable Capitulation; and in truth, this was the only place that made a brave Defence in Flanders since the War, and afforded no Suspition of any Treachery in the Surrender of it. But tho' Charleroy was the only Garrison the Spaniards lost in Flanders so late in the Year,Charleroy besieged and surrendred to the French. and for the saving of which, they themselves were so far from being able, that their Allies in Conjunction with them, had not been able to effect it, yet they were no better provided in Catalonia,
where the French, so early as the 29th of May, invested Roses both by Sea and Land, and carried the Siege of it on with that forwardness,Roses taken. that on the 5th of June the place was surrendred to them. I do not find they made any great Ef∣forts to enlarge this Conquest on that side, neither would the Spaniards give them any further Opportunity at pre∣sent; but it had been well, had they timely enough thought this to be too much, and so prevented it, but it's in vain to talk, they will have their fashion, and so we leave them and see what is done in Germany. Here the Germans were so slow, and the French so forward, that the latter passed the Rhine at Phillipsburg, and without any Opposition on the 18th of May, the Marquess de Cha∣milli with 2000 Men invested Heidleburg,Heidelburg taken and destroyed by the French. which had been long threatned by them, and the Duke de Lorge crossed the first Mountains with 30000 Men to oppose the Prince of Baden, that this Year commanded upon the Rhine; but was not yet in any condition to act, but defensively, and hardly that, so that poor Heidelburg was to shift for her self, and God knows, that was done but sorrily: For besides its weak∣ness otherwise, there was such a Division between the Sol∣diers and the Townsmen, about the Money that was called in, and which they would have go Current again; that when on the 19th, the Regiment of Sconbeck was ready to enter the Town to re-inforce the Garrison, the Townsmen were so incensed against the Soldiers, that they opposed the Entrance, which gave Melac an Opportunity to seize a Redoubt, from whence he could batter the back-part of the Works of the Town; and in short, the French on the 21st entred the Sub∣burbs with little Opposition, and their Granadiers drave the besieged with so much haste to the Castle Gates, that they left above 600 of their Soldiers without, who were all put to the Sword: The Governour of the Castle fearing the same Destiny, sent a Capuchin with Proposals to de Lorge, which the other was so far from admitting of, that he prepared for an Assault, which the Governour finding, he accepted of the Offers made him by the French, and on the 2d, the Garrison, to the Number of 1200 Men, 2 Pieces of Can∣non, and 12 Waggons laden with Baggage were conducted to Wimpel: But the Burning of the City and Castle of Heidleburg by the French, and other Barbarities committed in the Palainate, let others relate them that will, I have no Stomach to them. Flush'd with this Success, M. de Lorge advanced towards the Neckar, with a design to attack the Prince of Baden, who was encamped on the other side of the River, over which the French laid 2 Bridges in order to pass it, but they were so warmly received by the Germans both here and afterwards at Wimpsen, where they attempted the
same thing, that they were forced to quit the Enterprize, and come off with the Loss of near 1000 Men. Some time after this,The Dau∣phine inclin∣ed to attack the Prince of Baden. the Dauphine joined the Army, which was near 70000 strong, and finding the Pass of Zwingenberg would be of great Advantage to them, they took the said Castle by Storm, after they had routed some Parties without, and a very hot Dispute from within, with its small Garrison, who yet found a way to escape: This with other petty Successes, and their greatly out-numbring the Prince of Baden in Men, made the Dauphine desirous to attack him in his Camp near Flein; wherefore, tho' he knew how advantageously he was intrenched, yet on the 26th of July he crossed the Neckar, and advanced within 4 Hours march of the Prince, who there∣upon re-called all his Detachments to strengthen himself, and so much the more, since he had certain Advice on the 31st, That the Dauphine resolved to give him Battle, and that he would fall on the next Morning. In short, the French advanced the same day with all their Cavalry and 4000 Granadiers, and having raised some Batteries, set themselves to work, to force the Entrenchments, and encompassed the Left Wing of the Camp, which made the Prince send a Detachment of Horse into the Valley of Winsburg to dispute the Pass with them, and when about 2 he thought the French would have begun the Fight, they drew off and re-passed the Neckar with some Loss. Neither was there any other thing of Moment done there this Campaign, save the French putting a Gar∣rison into Stugard, and raising a very little Contribution-money (tho' they had such a strong Belief that the Dauphine would engage the Prince, that publick Prayers were put up for his Preservation every-where) so that after he had sent the fore-mentioned Detachment under Boufflers to the Siege of Charleroy, and another into Piedmont, he returned in the Month of Aug. to Versailles, with which we shall leave Ger∣many, and see what has been doing in Piedmont this Sea∣son. It was indeed time to open the Campaign, when the Duke of Savoy was quite recovered of his long Indisposition, where∣of mention was made last Year, and then he joined the Ar∣my, which was considerably strong, and made the Inhabi∣tants of the Dauphinate fear a worse Irruption into their Country than the last, and to begin to provide for their Safety accordingly: But the Designs of the Confederates seemed to drive the French first out of Italy, by dispossessing them of Cazal and Pignerol, neither of which was effected: 'Tis true, Cazal was block'd up for some time, and the Fort of St. George taken by Storm, which compleated the Blockade of that Place, but things went no further; And the Duke, with the main Army, laid Siege to Pignerol, took the Fort of
St. Bridget, that covered it, after the Loss of above 1500 Men, and such an obstinate Defence on the Besieged's part, that after all, it was made a doubt, whether they should carry on the Siege of the Town or Bomb it: All this took up so much time, that Catinat being reinforced with more Troops, and particularly with the foresaid Detachment from Germany, found himself in a Condition to act Offensively, and therefore he descended into the Plains; and this seeming to the Duke as if he had threatned Turin, he drew off from a∣bout Pignerol, and encamped at Marsiglia. The Consequence whereof we'll give you in the following Letter, written October the 5th by the Resident of the States of Holland from Turin to their High and Mightinesses upon that Occa∣sion. I Gave my self the Honour to acquaint your Lordships on the 3d instant,A Letter from Turin to the States General of the United Provinces, about the Battle of Marsiglia. That the Infantry of his Royal Highness's Army mar∣ched on the 2d from before Pignerol, to join the Cavalry, which they did the same day at Marsiglia, after having blown up the Fort of St. Bridget, and set fire at Piscina to all the Bombs and Ammunition which they could not carry away. The Army was presently drawn up in Battalia. The Marquess de Leganez com∣manded the Left Wing, composed of the King of Spain's Troops, as well Horse as Foot, and of the Regiments of Commerci, Taff, and Scrutenbagh, commanded by the Prince de Commerci. His Royal Highness, and under him the Count de Caprara, com∣manded the Right Wing, which was covered by the rest of his Im∣perial Majesty's and his Royal Highness's Cavalry. In the Right Wing, and the Corps de Battaille, was posted the Foot of his said Imperial Majesty, of his Majesty of Great Britain, and of his Royal Highness. The Corps de Battaille was commanded by Prince Eugene of Savoy, who had under him the Marquess de la Parelle, and the Count de las Torres. The Army being disposed in this order, march'd on Saturday the 3d into the Neighbourhood of Orbassan, from whence we per∣ceived the Enemies Army towards the Hills, between Orbassan and Piosasque: The Enemy seeing us thus advanced, made a shew of moving to us in order of Battel; but the Night coming on, the two Armies marched off to a greater distance from each other, to suffer the Troops to repose themselves. At Midnight we sent away all the Baggage, and put our selves into a Posture to receive the Enemy, who we perceived by the Ground their Army took up, were much more numerous than we. At break of day the Enemy advanced towards us, making use of the Advan∣tage they had in the Ground, which was full of Woods and Vine∣yards. They threw some Dragoons into the Village of Piosasque, situate upon a Hill, to cover their Right Wing, and began to play all their Artillery upon our Left Wing, which did us some Da∣mage;
But our Cannon being likewise very well posted, and well served, did great execution among their Cavalry. About half an hour after Eight, they fell upon our Left Wing with about 20000 men, without firing a Shot, having their Bagonets at the end of their Fusils, and their Swords in their Hands, but they were re∣pulsed and driven back with great vigour: They renewed their At∣tack, and took in Front and Flank the Neapolitan and Milaneze Horse, who after having courageously withstood the Fury of the Enemy, were at last over-powered by their Numbers, and pushed upon the German Horse; who being thereby put into disorder, and being at the same time charged by the little Gendermerie, were no longer able to keep their Ground, and fell upon the Infantry, which was put also into Disorder. The second Line being brought on to re∣pulse the Enemy, while the first Line rallied, the Horse gave way, by which means the said second Line not being able to withstand the Efforts of the Enemy, was obliged to give ground likewise. But while things passed thus in our Left Wing, the Enemy were thrice repulsed with great loss by our Corps de Battaille, and our Right Wing; and we had all along the Advantage on that side, un∣til the Enemies Horse which had made our Left Wing give way, attack'd our Infantry behind and in Flank, who had no longer any Horse to cover them on their Left, and were at the same time at∣tack'd by the Enemies Foot. Our Troops resisted them with extra-ordinary Courage, made their Cavalry give way by the means of our Cannon, (which was employed to very good purpose) and re∣pulsed them with a great Effusion of Blood. This Resistance and Effort of our Horse in the Right Wing, quite disheartned the Enemy, but they being 10000 Men stronger than we, and receiving a farther Reinforcement, attacked our Troops anew; So that being environed by their Cavalry, and very much fatigued, and without hopes of being succoured by our Horse, we were obliged to retire at Four in the Afternoon, leaving the place of Battle to the Ene∣my, with 10 or 12 Field-pieces, the rest being saved. Orders were given for our Troops to rally at Moncalier, where in the Evening most of the Foot passed the Po. Last Night and this Day a great many Soldiers came hither; the Enemy did not make the least shew of pursuing us. All the Troops fought very well, and the Action was very sharp on both sides. The Troops of his Majesty of Great Britain, which were in the Corps de Battaille, did par∣ticularly distinguish themselves, and the Duke of Schomberg who commanded them, fought on foot at the head of his own Regiment, and would not take any other command. The Count de las Torres desired him, after the Enemies third Attack, to take upon him the Command, and cause a Retreat to be made by the Foot of the Corps de Battaille and the Right Wing, which had not yet sustained any great damage; but the Duke of Schomberg told him, That it was necessary first to have his Royal Highness's Order, and until it came, they would bear the Enemies Fire; adding, That he found things
were gone so far, that they must now overcome or die. The Va∣lour of the said Duke is to be greatly admired; he had the Misfor∣tune to be wounded in the Thigh; one of his Serants who waited upon him in his Chamber, saved his Life; for he seeing the Duke fall run to him, and called for Quarter, but before he could be heard, was killed upon the Spot. The Duke at the same time was taken Prisoner, but Monsieur Catinat sent him back upon his Pa∣role, and he arrived here this Day. I had already desired a Trum∣pet of his Royal Highness (who came hither yesterday about 5 in the Evening) to go and demand him. I cannot yet exactly tell your Lordships how many are killed on our side. 'Tis thought that the Spanish Troops have sustained the greatest loss. The Regiments of his Majesty of Great Britain have likewise suffered very much, and there is not a Third of them left. Of the Regiment of Schom∣berg, 18 Officers are taken, many of which are mortally wounded, and of the others proportionably. We have yet no News of Collonel Montauban: l'Isle Marais, Lieutenant-Collonel is taken Priso∣ner: The Baron de Viskoute, Lieutenant-Collonel of the Regi∣ment of Schomberg, is also taken and wounded: De Loches, Lieutenant-Collonel, is kill'd or taken, with several Captains. There are 3 or 4 Captains of the Regiment of Miremont killed; Collo∣nel Monbrun has 4 dangerous Wounds, his Major is killed, and his Lieutenant-Collonel is killed, or Prisoner. Of the Troops of his Royal Highness, the Marquiss de la Suse Lieutenant of his Life-Guards, is killed; the Count de Chalaus, Collonel of the Regi∣ment of Mondovi, is likewise killed. Of the Troops of his Im∣perial Majesty, the Prince de Comerci is wounded in the Shoul∣der, and the Son of the Count de Palfi killed. The Enemies loss is at least as great as ours, and 'tis only to their Numbers that the Victory is to be attributed. We have of their Prisoners, Col. Montrevel, Quarter Master-General of the Horse; the Marquiss de Montmorenci Colonel, and other Officers, as well as a great many private Soldiers. We have likewise taken divers Colours, Standards and Kettle-Drums, and, except in the Left Wing, the Victory was on our side to the last. The Troops (who are most of them again rallied) have Orders, part of them to stay at Mon∣calier, and the rest to encamp before this City. The Enemy have not made any motion since their Victory, and are still in their Camp; they have only burnt some Houses about Bainasco. This Day was brought hither from Villa Franca, by the Po, the heavy Artillery that was made use of against Pignerol. We apprehended the Enemy would have sent a Detachment thither before it was em∣bark'd. All the Baggage which was likewise sent from Villa Fran∣ca, is come to Moncalier. As I am closing my Letter, I under∣stand that Col. Montaubon is arrived with about 500 Horse, which he rallied and brought from Villa Franca along the Po, to cover the Artillery I just now mentioned. Turin, Octob. 5th.
But while France was thus Triumphing every where over the Confederates, she felt a most dangerous Enemy within her own Bowels, that swept away a multitude of her Inhabi∣tants, which was Famine, which for all the Care the King could take, made the Face of the Kingdom look with a most ghastly Countenance, and which, with something else, made her pretty early make Proposals of Peace to the Emperor, that in themselves were not contemptible: But it was im∣possible to disjoin him from his Allies; and therefore find∣ing it would not do that way, it was given out then, and I am apt to believe it was so, or raised with an Intention that it should be so; That new Proposals of Peace were made to the King of Spain, the Empire, King of England, and the Duke of Savoy, by which it was offered to restore all the Places taken since the Treaty of Nimeguen; and withal, to surrender some as they were then fortified. But whatever there was in it, the Event shew'd it came to nothing. And now having in a manner done with the Affairs of the Allies and France, we'll see a little how the Emperor and his Confederates have fared with the Turks this Campaign. As for the Poles and Venetians, they were so far from doing any thing memorable in their respective Stations against the Insidels, that the former, instead of favouring the Designs of the Imperialists in Hungary, and keeping tight to their Obli∣gations, seemed inclinable, as was supposed, by the Instiga∣tions of the King of France, to clap up a Peace with the Port: And, to make such a Disingagement the more plau∣sible, the Polish Embassador at Vienna made some odd Propo∣sitions, by way of Complaint, to the Emperor, the Purport whereof we can no otherwise give, than by the Answer his Imperial Majesty made in these Words: HIS Sacred Imperial Majesty, our most gracious Lord, by the Relation humbly made to him, has been acquainted with the Proposals made to his Imperial Ministers at the Conference upon the 8th of May last, by the most Serene King of Poland's Ex∣traordinary Embassador, the Lord Samuel Proski, Knight of Mal∣ta, and Commendador of Posonia; and first with a deep Sense of Gratitude he acknowledges the Glorious Inclination of your Royal Majesty to carry on, and indefatigably continue this Sacred War, and that Succour so seasonably afforded at the Siege of Vienna. Which, nevertheless, in the most prudent Judgment of your Royal Majesty, was deemed more advantagious and more necessary than any other Expedition for the Preservation and Security of the Kingdom of Poland it self. However, his Imperial Majesty considers it as a Kindness solely conferred upon himself, and shall to perpetuity re∣cain the Memory of it; most ardently wishing, that the same Dan∣ger may never so nearly threaten the Kingdom of Poland, and
more especially Craccovia, the Metropolis of it; yet faithfully en∣gaging himself to be most ready upon all Occasions, even with the Hazard and Detriment of his Provinces, to repay the same Assistance and Favour, according to the Claim of mutual Confederacy, as has not only been formerly granted by him in the most desperate Ex∣tremities of the Polish Affairs, at what time the said City, with the Effusion of much Blood, was ransom'd to the Kingdom, as ma∣ny are living yet to remember, but what he has the Satisfaction to prove, not only by the Testimony almost of all the World, but of his own Conscience; that is to say, That in the present War he has not fail'd in any Duty of a Sincere Friend, a Neighbour and Con∣federate. Wherefore, though that same unexpected, and so little deserved, yet so plain an Accusation has been laid to his Charge, wherein for so many and much greater Acts of Royal Fraternity, as the Lord Embassador alledges, no reciprocal regard has been had to the Demands of the most Serene King, but that he could enu∣merate many, and those not ordinary Specimens of most Cordial Love, Friendship, and Good Will: Nevertheless, though such Commemo∣rations diminish rather the Merit of the Benefit, than augment the mutual Correspondencies of Friendship; his Imperial Majesty setting those aside, has commanded several Answers to be given to the rest of the Heads of the Lord Ambassador's Propositions. But whether this, or somewhat else, gave the K. of Poland full Satisfaction, or that some other Accident diverted that Crown from proceeding in the separate Negotiation of a Peace with the Turks, there was little more heard of it. But which way soever things stood with the Imperial Court in relation to their Allies, they were not a whit daunted; but, after having carried the Fortress of Jeno in Vpper Hungary, to∣wards the beginning of the Summer they made all things ready to besiege Belgrade. The Duke of Croy had the chief Command of the Imperial Army this Year, who, towards the latter end of July,Belgrade besieg'd by the Imperia∣lists. invested the Town; but the Trenches were not opened till the 13th of Aug. at Night, which were carried on towards the Counterscarp, the Besieged the same Day making a numerous Sally, as they did also on the 17th, but were repulsed both times with considerable Loss; as they were also the two following Days upon the same occasion; while the General, in the mean time, ordered a strong De∣tachment of Horse and Foot to go and lay a Bridge over the Danube, and to raise 5 Forts on each side the River, to stop the Enemies Fleets. On the 21st they began to build the said Bridge, from whence, as well as from the Imperial Fleet, they play'd furiously upon that of the Enemy, while they carried on their Trenches within 100 paces of the Counterscarp, and finished a great Battery, on which they planted 32 Cartouches, and some other Pieces of Cannon, which being on the 25th
reinforced with 10 Mortars, they battered the Place next Day with extraordinary Vigour and good Success, and so on till the 27th, when the Fort, on which the Turks had planted Cannon, from whence they play'd with great Fury on the Besiegers, was utterly ruined; And this encouraged the latter to work hard on a Battery, which they had begun to raise on the Left Hand, to ruine the Out-works of the Turks on that side; and though the Turks made stout Resistance, and made no less than 14 Mines, 11 of them were discovered, and the Besiegers discontinued their Works till they had found the other 3, which yet did not discourage the Turks, who hourly expected Relief to come up. Of this the Imperialists were sensible also; so that on the 31st of Aug. a Council of War was held, and Two Expresses sent away, one to Gene∣ral Veterani, and the other to Colonel Kiba, with Orders for the latter to march with all the Men under his Command near Minoviza, for the Security of that River; and in the mean time the Siege went on, and on the 7th of Sept. a Ge∣neral Assault upon the Counterscarp was resolved on: But all things not being ready till it was late, though the Attack was made with wonderful Bravery, the Turks, who had in the mean time Intelligence of it, and had made Provision accord∣ingly, made such an obstinate Defence, that, what with that and the Darkness of the Night, they failed to carry it. Whereupon the General, understanding the Grand Visier with 80000 Men was marching up, it was, on the 10th, re∣solved in a Council of War to raise the Siege;The Siege rais'd. which was done accordingly, and the Retreat made, without so much as the Loss of one Man, though the Enemy failed not to pur∣sue them: The Grand Visier, having thus gained his Point, sat down contented, without undertaking any Enterprize: And so the Campagne terminated without any other Action, saving that the Ban of Croatia was said to have taken a con∣siderable Town in Bosnia, which I do not find named any where; and that the Count of Heidersheim routed a conside∣rable Body of Turks and Tartars near Guila, killed several of them, burnt all their Provision, and took above 2000 Camels and Horses from them. We have made so little a Digression about the Affairs of Europe on the Turkish side, that it will be needless here to recapitulate what has been already said of things nearer Home, in order to a better View of the little that is yet remaining▪ only I desire it may be remembred, how successful the Fren King's Arms have been by Land, and unfortunate our Flee at Sea; which the States of Holland were so sensible of, tha they took an early Resolution considerably to augment bo their Army and Navy; for which the King thanked them their Assembly before his coming over for England; and af∣ter
his Arrival, to shew particularly the Dislike he had of the Sea-Proceedings, did, the Day before the Meeting of the Parliament, declare in Council, That he had appointed the Right Honourable Edward Russel, Esq to be admiral of the Fleet; and on the 7th of Nov. which was the Day of the Parliament's meeting, delivered himself to them in the following Speech: My Lords and Gentlemen, I Am always glad to meet you here;The King his Speech to the Par∣liament. and I could heartily wish that Our Satisfaction were not lessened at present, by Refle∣cting upon the Disadvantage We have received this Year at Land, and the Miscarriages in our Affairs at Sea. I think it is evi∣dent, that the former was only occasioned by the great Numbers of our Enemies, which exceeded Ours in all Places. For what relates to the latter, which has brought so great a Disgrace upon the Nation, I have resented it extreamly: And as I will take care that those who have not done their Duty shall be punished; so I am resolved to use My Endeavours, that Our Power at Sea may be rightly managed for the future. And it well deserves Our Consideration, Whether We are not defective, both in the Number of Our Shipping, and in proper Ports to the Westward, for the better Annoying our Enemies, and protecting Our Trade, which is so essential to the Welfare of this Kingdom. My Lords and Gentlemen, I am very sensible of the good Affection wherewith you have always assisted Me, to support the Charges of this War, which have been very great: And yet I am perswaded, that the Expe∣rience of this Summer is sufficient to convince Vs all, That to arrive at a good End of it, there will be a Necessity of encreas∣ing Our Forces, both by Sea and Land, the next Year. Our Allies have resolved to add to Theirs: And I will not doubt, but you will have such regard to the present Exigency, as that you will give Me a suitable Supply to enable me to do the like. I must therefore earnestly recommend it to you, Gentlemen of the House of Com∣mons, to take such timely Resolutions, as that your Supplies may be effectual, and Our Preparations so forward, as will be neces∣sary, both for the Security, and the Honour of the Nation. The House of Commons quickly came to an unanimous Resolution to support Their Majesties; and likewise shewed a good Disposition to comply with the King's Desires, in the Increase of his Forces, both by Sea and Land: But, at the same time, they did not forget to spend some time in the Examination of the Mis-carrying of the Smyrna Fleet; con∣erning which, they came to this Resolve, That the House was
of Opinion, that there had been a notorious and treacherous mis∣management in that Affair. But it is great pity the Rogues had not been found out, and hanged for their Pains. How∣ever, Bembow's Bombing and Burning some part of St. Ma∣loes about this time, gave some sort of Contentment to Mens Minds, tho' it was no Reparation of the Loss. With this Action we shall close up the Year, on the last day whereof the brave Prince Lewis of Baden landed at Gravesend, from whence he went to Whitehall, and thence to Kensington, to wait upon his Majesty, who received him with great Civility and Respect. His Majesty, while the Parliament was deliberating upon Raising the necessary Supplies for the Navy and Standing Army, and such Additional Force as was to be levy'd, was pleased to entertain this Prince with the Diversions of Hunt∣ing, Hawking, and other the like innocent Recreations; to say nothing of the weightier Affairs of the War,The Pro∣ceedings of the English Parliament. concerted between them. And the Bill of 4 s. in the Pound, for carrying on a vigorous War against France, being ready, he gave the Royal Assent to it on the 25th of Jan. as he did some Days after to a Bill for Granting several Rates and Duties of Excise upon Beer, Ale, and other Liquors, for Securing certain Recom∣pences to such Persons as should voluntarily advance the Summ of 1000000 l. towards carrying on the War against France. But before the Signing of any more Acts, came the unfortunate News of our Loss in the Mediterranean; which, tho' a most melancholly Story, yet it is not to be omitted: And thus it fell out, Sir Francis Wheeler was Admiral of the Squadron of Men of War, who, with the Fleet of Merchant Ships under his Convoy, sailed on the 17th of Febr. from Gibraltar, to∣wards the Streights, with a good Wind at N. W. But o Sunday, about 10 in the Morning, there arose such a violent Storm, with Thunder and Lightning, and great Rain, that hardly any Man in the Fleet ever saw the like; which con∣tinued all that Day, and the following Night, the Wind blowing at E. and E. N. E. so that upon Monday the 19th, about 5 in the Morning,Sir Francis Wheeler lost Sir Francis Wheeler's own Ship, the Sussex, was founder'd, and all her Men, except two Moors, were lost; and the Admiral's Body was, on the 21st, found on a Sand-Bank, near Gibraltar, in his Shirt and Slippers; which made People believe, that he, seeing himself in such imminent Danger, had stripped off his Clothes, with a De∣sign to save his Life by swimming. But tho' the Loss was already too great, it had been well if it had stopped here▪ But, alass! the Cambridge, Lumley-Castle, (Men of War) the Serpent Bomb-Ketch, and the Mary Ketch, together with the Italian-Merchant, the Aleppo-Factor, the Great George, and the
Berkshire, bound for Turkey; the William for Venice; and the Golden-Merchant, for Leghorne, all English, were driven a∣shoar, and lost, on the E. side of Gibraltar, and most of the Men drowned; As were also 3 Dutch Ships, of good Value: But Reer-Admiral Neville, with 2 Dutch Men of War, had the good Luck to be blown out of the Streights, and put safe into Cadiz, as the rest of the Fleet did on the 19th into Gi∣braltar, to repair the Damages they had sustained in the Storm. But tho' this Loss was heavy in it self, yet, God be thank∣ed, it did not so affect the Nation, but that they went chear∣fully on still with their Business. The finishing of our Men of War upon the Stocks was pushed on with great Diligence: And the Parliament lost no Time in their Work neither; for, besides the new Levies ordered to be made; by the 23d of March, they had, among other Bills, passed one, To grant to their Majesties certain Rates upon Salt, Ale, Beer, and other Liquors, for Securing certain Recompences and Advantages to such Persons as should voluntarily advance the Summ of 1000000 l. toward carrying on the War. And then the King having told them how forward the Enemy was, and what Necessity there was of their being ready to meet them, both by Sea and Land, he earnestly recommended to them the Dispatch of those important Affairs they had still under their Delibera∣tions; and protested to them, he had nothing so much at his Heart, as the Ease and Happiness of his People; and that it was with great Reluctancy he was forced to ask such large Supplies from them; but their present Circumstances made the same unavoidable. Neither was it long before His Ma∣jesty's Expectations were fully answered, for in April the following Acts, among others, were ready for his Signing, viz. An Act for Raising Money by a Poll,Acts of Par∣liament signed. payable Quarterly, for one Year. An Act for granting to their Majesties several Rates and Du∣ties upon Tunnage of Ships and Vessels; and upon Beer, Ale, and other Liquors, for Securing certain Recompences and Advan∣tages to such Persons as should voluntarily advance the Summ of 1500000 l. towards carrying on the War against France. An Act for Granting to their Majesties several Duties upon Vellom, Parchment and Paper, for 4 Years. And also, An Act for Licensing and Regulating Hackney and Stage-Coaches. This was no sooner done, and that the King had thanked them for the great Proofs they had given him of their Affe∣ctions this Session; and his acquainting them with the Ne∣cessity there was of his being absent for some time, out of the Kingdom, but the two Houses were Prorogued to the
18th of Sept. following. And so we leave them, and his Majesty, for the present, going to make the Campaign in the Netherlands; and see a little what the Consequence was of the mighty Preparations for Sea which we had been making all this Spring. But tho' our Fleet was so early out this Year, they were neither able to block up that of France, in Brest, nor to come at them to fight them at Sea, than which, the Eng∣lish desired nothing more; and the French as much declined it, so that they would first venture a Caper into the Mediter∣ranean, (whither they actually went) rather than hazard a Battel. But the Truth of it is, they had concerted such vast Designs against Spain, both by Sea and Land, this Cam∣paign, that, had it not been for our Fleet's going into those Seas, I cannot see what could have hindered the French to have made an entire Conquest of Catalonia, before the Ar∣my went into Winter-Quarters.Admiral Russell, with the Fleet, ails for Spain. But before Admiral Russ had entirely left the Coast, and sailed with the Fleet fo Spain, he, upon Information that there was a Fleet of French Merchant-men in Bertraume-Bay, bound to the Eastward▪ detatched Captain Pickard, and the Roe-Buck Fire-ship, either to take, or destroy them: Which Orders Captain Pickar▪ executed so successfully, that of 55 Sail of them, he bur or sunk 35, besides the Man of War that was their Co∣voy, which ran among the Rocks, and soon after blew up with her two Sloops of between 10 and 15 Guns. After this, Captain Pickard re-joined the Fleet, which we shall no leave, making its best way to the Mediterranean, and he give you a Relation of the Descent which the English at∣tempted to make upon France, and even upon Brest it self▪ Of which take the following Relation, as abstracted by a learned Hand, from the Account given of it by the Mar∣quess of Carmarthen, which has been generally allowed to be the best extant upon that Subject. On the 5th of June the Lord Berkeley, Admiral of the Blue Squadron, parted from Admiral Russell, with 29 Sail of Line of Battel Men of War, English and Dutch, besides small Frigats, Fire-ships, Well-boats, Bomb-vessels, &c. in order to the Attacking of Brest; and upon the 7th he came t an Anchor between Camaret-Bay and the Bay of Bertrau by 7 in the Morning; tho', as the main Fleet tacked fro Shoar to Shoar, (which they were forced to do, to come the place where they intended to Anchor) they had a World of Bombs thrown at them, first from Camaret Western Point then from a high Castle, upon a high Rock, in Bertrau-Bay; then from two Forts on each side of the Isthmus go∣ing into Brest-Road, the one called Point Minoux, the othe Point des Fillettes: But neither the one nor the other di
any harm, tho' they continued throwing Bombs from all the places before-mentioned, till 10 at Night. While the whole Fleet was thus preparing to come to an Anchor, the Lord Cutts, and the Marquess of Carmarthen, in his own Galley, taking several other Persons along with them, stood in a considerable way into the Bay; and after they had gained a good View of it, and got out again without any Damage, tho' warmly fired at by Camaret-Fort, they returned, and gave the Lord Berkeley an Account of the Po∣sture of the Bay, and the Situation of the Castle, which was very advantageously placed, to defend the Landing-places, against any that should attempt to set Footing on Shore. Thereupon it was thought convenient, that the Monk of 60 Guns, and the Diamaten of equal Force, should go in for that purpose. But the Marquess, who had viewed the Place, not believing that those two Men of War would be sufficient to cover the Boats, at their Landing, from the Shot from the Fort, nor to assist the Land-Forces, at their Landing, by playing upon the Enemy, who were better pre∣pared, and more numerous, than was expected; and ready to be seconded, upon all Occasions, with 14 Squadrons of Horse, all regular Troops, so far as they could discern by their Habit: Therefore, upon the 8th, after a Consultation of the English and Dutch Flags, and the General-Officers of the Land-Forces, it was resolved, That 6 more Men of War should be added to the 2 former, viz. the Greenwich, of 54 Guns; the Charles-Galley, of 32; the Shoreham, of 32; the Darkenstein, of 44; the Wesep, of 30; and the Wolf of 30 Guns: All which the Marquess undertook to post, so as to bear upon the Castle to the best Advantage, and to perform those other Services for which they were design∣ed. This was a Work of great Labour, Difficulty, and Dan∣ger; for no sooner was the Monk come within reach of the Enemy's Mortars, but the Enemy began to fling their Bombs at her from Point des Fillettes, and the Western Point of Ca∣maret-Bay; insomuch, that when she came within 3 Quarters of a Mile of the latter, one of the Bombs broke just over her, and a great piece of it striking through her Poop, and two Decks more, flew out again into the Water, near one of the Stern-Ports, and killed 2 of the Marquess's Marine Company, and wounded a third, who stood close by him, on the Poop. So soon as she got into the Bay, and came up a-brest with the Western Point, Camaret-Fort fired thick and three∣fold at her; and she being forced to stand with her Stern right upon it, the Shot from thence raked her fore and aft, and did her a great deal of Damage. More than this; af∣ter
all the Ships were got pretty well into the Bay, they were surprized with three Batteries more, all firing upon them, which they never perceived till they felt their Shot. But, notwithstanding all these Difficulties, the Marquess made a shift to post the 8 Ships in such a manner, as gave great Succour to the Land-Forces, and did the Enemy con∣siderable Mischief: For these Ships, so soon as they had drop∣ped their Anchors in the Bay, fired continually upon the Enemy, and forced the French to run twice out of Camaret-Fort. From these Ships it was easie to perceive the Enemy very advantageously entrenched at every place where there was any possibility of Landing, and great Numbers of Foot drawn behind the Trenches. On the Other side, Lieutenant-General Talmash, with a small Number of Well-boats, went a-shore in a confused manner, under a little Rock on the South-side of the small Bay. Nor was there any Prosecution of that regular Way of Landing which the Lord Cutts proposed, and had been a∣greed on. Here his Lordship excuses himself, for not being able to give an Account of what passed close by the Shore; and goes on, That when he saw the Boats and small Vessels, in which the Land-Forces were embarked, had made their Retreat from thence, excepting such as stuck fast, wherein a great many were killed, and taken Prisoners, and the Signal given to bring off the Ships, he applied himself to undergo the greatest Difficulty he had in all the Action; for that all their Rigging was cut in pieces, and most of their Sails and Yards disabled. The Shoreham, not so much disabled as the rest, got clear out of Danger, with little Assistance: But it cost the Marquess a world of Labour, and hard Venturing, to get off the rest; but more especially the Charles-Galley, and the Monk, that was within half her length of dashing against a Rock, as having no other Motion but what the Sea and Tow-boats afforded her: But at length, he being indefati∣gable in his Labour, and undaunted in his Courage, per∣formed what he undertook, and brought of all clear but the Tesep, a small Dutch Man of War, of 30 Guns, which he found with 12 Foot Water in her Hold, and all the Men kil∣led that were left with the Lieutenant, but himself, a Drum∣mer, and one Man more. As for the Loss sustained at Sea, his Lordship acknow∣ledges 400 Men lost in the 3 English and 4 Dutch Ships, un∣der his Command. As for the Loss of the Land-Forces, he says, he was not acquainted with it; But the Report was▪ That the Killed, Wounded, and Taken, amounted to about 700 more.
But what Error soever, that brave Man Lieutenant Ge∣neral Talmash might have committed in his Landing, he paid very dear for it with the loss of his Life, as did I doubt, a much greater number of Men killed and wounded, than my Lord talks of in his unfortunate Expedition, which for my part, I think could not be otherwise than so; since the French by such strong Works, Batteries, and great Forces, had ta∣ken so much Precaution to defend themselves against this Attempt (of which, and the place of Landing, they had, no doubt, timely information enough) which they could not well be without, since it was no secret in England, but a Town∣talk at this time, that Brest was the place we designed to Land at. But how unsuccessful soever we proved in this Expedition,The death of the Prince of Liege, and Choice of another. the King had managed his Affairs so well, both at home and abroad this Season, that he began now to beard the French, and this since the beginning of the War, was the first time they seemed to be upon the decline in Flanders▪ Its true, the Death of the Bishop and Prince of Liege, to∣wards the beginning of this Year, gave the French a mighty Prospect to imbroil the Affairs of the Confederates on that side: For as the Death of the Elector of Cologn in 1688, and the Contests between the Empire and France, in the two Persons of Prince Clement of Bavaria, and Cardinal Furstem∣burg, gave the first Occasion to the Flame of this War to break forth in Germany, that soon after by divers concur∣ring Accidents, spread it self over the Face of almost all Eu∣rope; So if the French could have got the Cardinall de Bo∣villon, to have been advanced into the Principality of Liege, they did not doubt but to have brought the Confederates to be more humble, and to have accepted of the Conditions of Peace, the French King would allow them, but this did not happen neither. For notwithstanding all Bovillion's Protesta∣tions, the major part of the Chapter first made Choice of the Elector of Cologn, and the other of the Grand Master of the Tutonick Order, to be their Prince and Bishop, both which sent to the Emperor and Court of Rome about it; and this was as likely to imbroil the Confederates Affairs, as any thing that had yet hapned, the last named of the Can∣didates or Princes Elect, being no less than Brother-in-Law to the Emperor, who we might reasonably suppose would espouse his Cause with all the Interest he had, as the other was Brother to the Elector of Bavaria; who besides his own Interest that was considerable, had, 'twas generally believed, that of the King of England, and the States of Holland on his side. But while things hung thus in suspence, and that particularly both Parties were expecting the Decision of the See of Rome, Heaven decided the Contest in an unexpected
manner, by the Death of the Grand Master, of a certain contagious Distemper, that had for some time been rise in the City of Liege, and so the Elector of Cologn in some time after got the peaceable Possession of the Principality, which together with the great Power of the Confederates in Flan∣ders, made things look with an ill Aspect upon the Affairs of France. For the Confederate Army now under the King's Command, encamped at Mont St. Andrew, where they all joined,The Cam∣paign in Flanders. amounting in Horse and Dragoons to no less than 31800 Men, all very well Mounted and Armed; and of the Dragoons, more especially it may be said, that such a Body either for Number, or the good Order they were in, has hardly ever been in the Field, and in Foot to 51000, be∣sides a Body of about 7000 Men, under the Command of Count Thien near Ghendt. But tho' the French were not far inferiour in Number, yet the Dauphine used all his Endea∣vours to decline Fighting, and the King put him hard to it, so that the French Army was in a manner couped up by him for a time, under the Walls of their Garrison of Huy, and reduced to considerable streights, where we shall leave them and the Confederates in their respective Camps, and where they continued while the English Fleet in the Chan∣nel were Bombing the Maritime-Towns of France, to the great Consternation of the poor Inhabitants, as well as their utter Ruin: And what good Mein soever the French Court put upon it; it was a business that made them Heart-sick, as afterwards appeared when they came to Bombard Brus∣sells. Diep in Normandy was the first Town that felt the Fu of the English Bombs,Diep and Have de Grace Bom∣brdd by the English. before which, my Lord Berkley o the 12th of July, brought the Fleet as near as possible, and sent 6 Ment of War, and 9 Bomb Galliots away to take their Stations, and from that day at Night, till 4 the next Morn∣ing, they threw into the City 1100 Bombs and Carcasse that set the Houses on Fire in several places, so that the Townsmen, not knowing whither to run, and despairing to quench it, took a fright and began to run away in Disorder, which made the Marquess of Bearon send 2 Battalions of the Militia of Bretaign to encourage the Inhabitants, but the Disorders were so great, and the Fire so terrible, that the Soldiers fled with the rest: So that if the Confederates had known what had passed, they might in all probability have possest themselves of the Place; however they so ruin'd it, that there was hardly a House left unshattered, but the greatest part were intirely reduced to Ashes. From hence the Fleet allarming all the Coast, sailed towards Havre de Grace where on the 26th, about 3 in the Afternoon, they bega to approach the Town, under the Direction of Captain Bemb
into which, between 4 and 5 they began to throw their Bombs, which they continued till next Morning, when the Wind blowing hard, they gave over shooting, but tho' Ha∣vre de Grace was not entirely ruined as Dep was, yet a great part of it was Burnt, and so considerable Damage done to the Place, as was not soon repaired. And if the French were thus put to it on the Coast,The Confe∣derates and French in motion to∣wards Flan∣ders. their Army was not a little streightned, by that of the Confede∣rates in the Netherlands, for though the Dauphine declared, he had received Orders from his Father, not to budge from his Camp at Vignamont, as long as the Confederates continu∣ed at theirs at Mont St. Andre, yet being not able possibly to subsist there any longer, he resolved to decamp first, and though he thought to have concealed his design, by sending forth several little Bodies of Horse, under Pretence of For∣raging, to reinforce the Marquess of Harcourt's Body on the other side of the Meuse, who was to seize the advantageous Post of Picton, and by that means get before the Confede∣rates; yet the King who was aware of the Design, decamp∣ed before him on the 8th of Aug. and soon gained the Posts of Picton, where there was not Forrage for above 4 days, and being informed of the Enemies March, moved towards Ne∣ville, thence to Lessines, having sent Orders before for the Baking of Bread at Ghent and Aeth. On the 12th, the Ar∣my posted it self at Chieere, from whence that Evening a nu∣merous Detachment of Horse and Foot, with some Pieces of Cannon, went to possess themselves of a Post upon the Scheld, and the Army followed on the 14th, with an intention to have passed the River at Pont Espeires: But tho' the Confederates made great haste to get thither, the French made more to prevent them. For on the 15th, the Elector of Bavaria, having advanced towards Pont de Eschaiee, with a numerous Detachment, in order to attack the Passage of the River, he found the French to the number of 30000 Men, entrenched on the other side up to their Teeth, so as that he did not think it convenient to proceed. But that hasty March of the French, cost them more Men and Horses than they have been willing to own they had lost in some of their Battles. However, it must be said it was a business that was worth while to hinder the Confederates to enter into French Flan∣ders, where if they had once done so, they would in all pro∣bability, together with some important Conquest, have se∣cured some Winter Quarters at least; Besides other losses that would almost inevitably have followed: And this the French King was so sensible of, that he writ a Letter, with Orders for the reading it at the Head of the Army,The French King his Letter to the Army wherein he returned thanks in the first place, to the Princes of the Blood; then to the Mareshal de Luxemburg, as having a prin∣cipal
share in the Conduct, to the rest of the Marshals of France, and all the General Officers, and lastly to all the French and Swiss Infantry, Regiment by Regiment, begin∣ning with that of the Guards, and acknowledged how much beholding he was to their Zeal and infinite Diligence for the Preservation of their Country, Lives, and most inportant Places on the Sea-side, and assured them, he would acknow∣ledge upon all Occasions, that same Testimony of their Af∣fection, and desired a continuation of it. But as the French did not a little Triumph, they had warded this Blow; the King was resolved they should not always have occasion to do so, and therefore finding the Enemy very intent to watch his Motion in a new seat of War, he laid hold of the Advantage, and in pursuance of it, the Prince Serclas de Tilly passed the Meuse at Thilen, with all the Horse and Dragoons of the Diocess of Liege, being followed by a party of Brandenburg Horse, and some Battalions of Foot, and the same day invested Huy, where the next day arrived 16 Regiments of Foot,Huy besieged by the Con∣federates and taken. with the Duke of Holstein Ploen, who was appointed to Command the Siege. The Place was no sooner invested on both sides the Meuse, but the Town surrendred to the Confederates, and by the 19th of Sept. the Batteries were raised against the Castle, and the Artillery that consisted of 60 Pieces of Cannon, and 30 Mor∣tars, came up when the French made a Sally upon Major-Ge∣neral Cohorn's Quarters, in hopes to have taken 3 Field-pieces, but they were repulsed with loss, and so the Works went on briskly till the 21st at Night, when the Besieged opened their Trenches. These they carried on with great Vigour, till that on the 24th, in the Morning, the Brandenburg under-Officer of the Regiment of Anhault, mounted the Counter-scarp of Fort Piccard, at the head of 15 Soldiers only, and that with so much Courage and Bravery, that they killed the few French that were there, threw a Tunful of Grana∣does into the Water, and took away a Barrel of Powder and some Arms, which he brought into the Camp; And all this in the sight of the Duke of Holstein Ploen, and other Ge∣nerals, who were so satisfied with his Bravery, that the Bran∣denburg General immediately wrote to the Elector, to desire him to bestow a Captain's Place upon the young Officer. The Besiegers the same day continued firing upon the Castle and two Forts, both which last were taken by 700 Branden∣burghers by dint of Sword, who in the heat of their Fury, put 150 French to Death, but gave Quarter to 70 others that were mostly wounded, and all this with the loss only of 20 Men; So that being flush'd with Success, they pushed on the Siege of the Castle with wonderful Vigour, wherein they had made a considerable Breach, and had all things ready
for an Assault by the 27th, when the Governour beat a Parly, and the Articles were soon agreed on, whereby the Garrison was to be convoy'd into Namur, which was done accordingly, and the French thereby totally expelled out of the Diocess of Liege, Dinant at that time being accounted a part of France. Thus ended the Campaign in Flanders, not very pleasing to the French, tho' perhaps, all Circumstances considered, with less disadvantage than themselves expected; however, they made amends for it to purpose in Spain, as has been already hinted, and of which we shall now briefly run over the Particulars. The French Army,The French Progress in Catalonia. under the Command of the Mareschal de Noailles, being about 30000 strong, and consequently, much superiour to the Spaniards, and very early in the Field to boot, arrived on the 26th of May on the Banks of the River Ter in Catalonia, which notwithstanding they found the Spaniards intrenched on the other side, they resolved to pass; and having, to that end, sounded all the Fords that same Evening, they forced their way through, after about half an Hours Dispute, and constrained the Spanish Foot to quit their Retrenchments without any great Resistance: But the Cavalry shewed a more than ordinary Valour and great Conduct in their Retreat, which they performed in the best manner they could to cover their Foot; yet this could not prevent the loss of their Baggage; though what with the Defence the Horse made, and the Narrowness of the Ways, the French made no far pursuit. However, this point of passing the Ter was enough gained for them to besiege Pa∣lamos, a Town by the Sea-side, about 22 Leagues from Bar∣celona to the S. E. which was invested on the 30th of May, and by the 2d of June at Night the Trenches were opened, and the Works carried on a good way, though not without Disturbance both from the small Shot and Cannon of the Be∣sieged, which killed a great many Men; and next Day they made a Sally, at first with good Success, but they were at length repulsed, and ply'd close with Mortars and Cannon both by Sea and Land, so that by the 7th in the Morning all things were in a readiness to attack the Covert-way: This the Granadeers did with great Fury, and were so far from losing time to make Lodgments, that they pushed for∣ward, and finding a way to enter at two Breaches, where only one could pass in Front, they entred the City, plun∣der'd it, and put all they met to the Sword; and of those that were saved, all were made Prisoners of War: Only part of the Officers that were most wounded were sent to Gironne upon their Paroles; Not only, said Monsieur Noailles in his Letter, because they seemed to desire it, but because he con∣sidered the Terror that would strike among the Soldiery and People.
And what he said was true enough; for the Spaniards quick∣ly withdrew their Garrison out of St. Felix Quinola, and the Castle of St. Elme; and though they pretended to make a stout Resistance at Gironne, a well-fortify'd City, that Noa∣lles had actually laid Siege to by the 19th of June; Yet they could scarce hold it for 10 Days, for they surrender'd the Place on the 29th of the same Month, and that upon very ignominious Terms too. For the Garrison was to march out without Cannon, and the Cavalny, except 10 in a Troop, to march away on Foot with the Infantry without their Horses, and all the Ammunition and Provision to be left behind in the City. This being effected successfully, the next thing was to attack Ostralick, a little City upon the Road to Barcelona, which they quickly mastered without any great Resistance, and thereby enlarg'd the French Territories 20 Miles in extent. But the Army, because of the violent Heats, beginning now to be sickly, they went into Quarters of Refreshment upon the Banks of the River Terdera, which is a very plentiful Country, and full of Fruit-trees, and where they continued in a manner as unmolested from the Spaniards, as if they had been in the middle of France. But it was not so with the Spaniards on the part of the French▪ for after they had refreshed themselves, they bethought of taking in Castle Folet, a Town a little to the W. of Gironne, which they took, having first routed a Body of Country Mi∣litia that came to relieve it, and made the Garrison Prisoners of War. But tho' the Spaniards thought to profit them∣selves of this Opportunity, by re-taking Ostralick, which they actually besieged with 4000 Foot and 1500 Horse, and had reduced it to that Condition, that the Governour was up on Articles of Surrender, and Hostages were given on both sides; yet so fatal was the Slowness of this People to them∣selves in insisting that the Miquelets should be Prisoners of War; that the Governour, in the mean time, having notice that Noailles was marching to his Relief, redemanded his Hostages, and refused to stand to the Articles; so that the Siege was immediately raised. But by this time the Confe∣derate Fleet, and such an one as those Seas never saw before, was arrived in the Streights under the Command of Admiral Russel, as much to the heartning of the Spaniards, who seemed before to have given all for lost in Catalonia, as it was a Mortification to the French, who did not expect any such thing;The French Fleet con∣fined to Thoulon. and now saw their Error in sending their Grand Fleet into those Seas, where they must be couped up in the Harbor of Thoulon, and be forced to leave all their Coasts, both on the Ocean as well as the Mediterranean side unguard∣ed, and subject to every Insult of the Enemies. And tho' Monsieur Tourville once adventured out to Sea, with a design
to slip by the English Admiral, yet he quickly found the other had so sharp an Eye upon him, that he was forced to return to his Port again, and rest contented to lie in Souce there for the rest of the Winter; from whom at present we shall take our Leave,The Cam∣pagne in Germany. and post into Germany. Here we find the Prince of Baden at the Head of the Imperialists, and Mon∣sieur de Lorge commanding the French Army, which, towards the beginning of June, passed the Rhine, and adventured, in Order of Battle, towards the Prince incamped near Hail∣bron, who, believing, they would fight, went on to meet them; But they considered better of it, and retreated to∣wards Wiselock, passed the Neckar, burnt the Town of Law∣denburg, and ruined the Flat Country; which so incensed the Prince of Baden, that, though he were not yet reinforced by the Saxons, yet he advanced to Wiselock, a Post near which there happened a sharp Rencounter between a Detachment of French and Germans, wherein the former lost near 300 Men, and the latter near half the number, but withal gain∣ed the Post; which Monsieur de Lorge was so far from liking▪ that he repassed the Rhine 3 Days after, viz. Von the 28th of June. After this we had nothing from both Armies for a time, but that they had posted themselves the best they could, in order to observe one another; till at length the Prince of Baden, impatient of Action, resolved in his turn to cross the Rhine, and to that end ordered the Marquess of Bade Dourlack to pass the said River at Schwartzbach and Daxland with 23800 Horse and Foot, who was followed next Day by the Prince himself; which de Lorge no sooner heard of, but he marched towards Landau. But the Prince advanced, and possessed himself of divers small Places, and all the Pas∣ses as far as Croon-Weissemburg, and mighty Expectations there were, that the Germans now would either force the French to a Battle, or manage their Affairs so, as to secure Winter-Quarters on that side the Rhine, or at least compleat the Ru∣in of the Country; but neither succeeded. For the first News that almost came, was their repassing the Rhine again, which, was said, was chiefly occasioned by the great Rains that fell, which very much endangered the breaking down the Bridges the Prince had laid over that River: However, they made a safe Retreat, brought away with them 14000 Head of Cattle, destroyed a vast quantity of Forage in the Country, and some Magazines of the French, which put an end to the Sum∣mer's Work on that side. There is little to be said of the Affairs of Savoy this Year;The Cam∣pagne in Savoy. for though the Duke absolutely rejected the Proposals made unto him by France after the Battle of Marsaglia, yet he did, or would do little or nothing now in the Field, where the French were not so considerable, as since they have been: For
besides what the Vaudois did in the Valley of Pragelas, in burning some Villages of the French, and taking some Mules laden with Provisions, and the routing some Irish Detach∣ments sent against them in the Valley of St. Martin, which gave them an Opportunity to make a Ravage into Dauphine as far as Brianson, we have nothing to say of the main Ar∣my: For though it was expected on all Hands they would have besieged Casal, and the Success of the Enterprize not much doubted of, yet all that was done was the taking the Fort St. George, and thereby further straitning that Place, of which Siege you shall hear more next Year. Neither were there any great matters done in Hungary; for though the Turks were considerably superiour to the Imperialists in num∣ber, who were this Year, as the last, commanded by General Caprara, yet all that ever the Grand Visier could do, could not force their Camp near Carlowitz, nor destroy their Fleet; so that the Grand Visier, upon the st and 2d of Octob. drew off his Camp, having sent away his Artillery and Baggage before, and left only some few Carriages, Hutts, and other things of little Value behind them. But because the Reasons of the Turks. Retreat give the best Account of the Principal Passages that happened during their Attempt upon the Impe∣rialists, they are these that follow: 1st, Because a Detachment of Hussars, from the Garrison of Titul, being out upon a Party, towards the Danube, near Salankemen, intercepted 20 great Boats, laden with Meal, and other Provisions, together with a Frigat that convoyed them; and constrained several other Barks to row back to Belgrade as fast as they could: They killed above 100 Men in the Ren▪ counter, and forced 100 more into the River, where they were either drowned, or taken Prisoners, of which Number was an Aga; together with seven Colours: So that the Otto∣man Army had been seven Days in great Want. 2dly, For that it having rained for three Days and five Nights, the Turks Approaches were very much endamaged, and the Janisaries so discouraged, by standing up to the middle of the Leg in Water, and for want of Victuals, that they re∣fused to work any more. 3dly, Because the Grand Visier having, by his continual Importunities, obliged the Cham of Tartary to send a nume∣rous Detachment of his Horse to the other side of the Danu▪ that Detachment had been vigorously repulsed by the Impe∣rialists, under Major-General Bassompierre; So that the Tar∣tars were constrained to flee, part on this side the Danube, and the rest on the other side of the Theysse, with the Loss of Sultan Galga's Son, and 500 more killed, besides those that were drowned in the two Rivers, and they who perished in the adjoining Marishes: So that of 7000 Men, of which that De∣tachment
consisted, but very few returned to the Camp; they that escaped to the other side of the Theysse, under the Com∣mand of Sultan Galga, and had taken the Road to Temeswaer, not exceeding the Number of 2000. 4thly, Because that upon this ill Success, the Cham had fallen out with the Grand Visier, upbraiding him with lead∣ing Men to Slaughter; declaring, that he would no longer act under him, but return home with all his Forces. 5thly, Because that while the Ottomans held the Imperialists and the Fortress of Waradin in a manner besieged, they had lost above 15000 Men, partly killed, and partly dead of se∣veral Diseases. 6thly, Because that the Arnauts, seeing the Tartars rea∣dy to march off, began to talk of returning home in like manner. 7thly, Because that several of their Galleys and Saickicks were ruined by the Batteries of the Imperialists. 8thly, Because the Grand Visier, for the Reasons already alledged, and finding his Trenches so incommoded by the wet Weather, saw no possibility of succeeding in his Design of forcing the Imperial Camp, of destroying the Danubian Fleet, or winning the Fortress of Peter-Waradin, the Key, or Bulwark, not only of all the Imperial Conquests, but of all Christendom. We have nothing to add farther as to the Hungarian Af∣fairs, save that the Turks made a fruitless Attempt upon Ti∣tull; and so both sides betook themselves to their Winter-Quarters. But tho' the Turks, in respect to the Germans, were no Losers this Campaign, it being well enough that the latter could stand their Ground; yet it was not so in reference to the Venetians, who, tho' they lost towards the beginning of the Year, their Captain-General and Doge Morosini de∣parting this Life on the 6th of Jan. at Napoli di Romania; yet they seemed as forward as ever in their Warlike Prepa∣rations, having made Choice of Signior Zeno for Captain-General, while General Steinau commanded their Land-Forces in the Levant. But the first Progress of their Arms was in Dalmatia, where, about the beginning of June, Ge∣neral Delfino having drawn together 12000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, partly Militia, and partly Regular Troops; and em∣barking his Infantry, with Ammunition and Artillery neces∣sary for his Expedition, he landed the 15th within a Mile of Ciclut, upon the River Narenta; and having raised 2 Bat∣teries, and played upon the 2 Towers that secured the Bridge, they were presently surrender'd to him: And on the 17th, being joined by the Horse, he attacked the Town it self with much Fury, and by the 21st was in full Possession of it: Wherein he found 1700 Barrels of Gun-Powder, and 18
Pieces of Cannon, and one very large one, with this Inscrip∣tion, Caolus Archidux Graeciae. The Turks were so mad at this Loss, that quickly after they besieged it with 1000 Men; but the Garrison, whom Signior Delphino took care to re-inforce, made such an obstinate Defence, that the Turks, after the Loss of above 2000 Men, were constrained to raise the Siege. But tho' Delphine, to this Conquest of Cicult, not long after added that of Cobluch, seated in Erzegovina, two Davs Journey from Castel-Nuo, which was obtained after a Siege of 9 Days, which the Intelligence that the Chevalier Bolizzo held in the Place did not a little facilitate; yet this was nothing to the Conquest of the Island of Scio, where the Venetians landed on the 7th of Sept. under the Command of General Steinau, without any great Opposition; and often having made themselves Masters of all the Posts within a Mile round the Place, upon the 9th they seized upon the Su∣burbs nigh the Castle, containing about 2000 Inhabitants. Next Day they began to batter the Castle with 4 Pieces of Cannon and 4 Mortars, with that Success, that the Place was set on fire in several parts; and having the same Day seized upon the Fortress that secures the Haven, and took the Arsenal, not far off, together with three Galleys, com∣manded by the Bey of Rhodes, with divers Merchant-ships that lay in the Harbour, they spent the next two Days in carrving on their Approaches, and succeeded so well, that on the 14th they sprung a Mine designing to blow up the Counterscarp; which, tho' it wrought not that Effect that was expected, Yet the hideous Noise it made, and the ter∣rible Havock which the Bombs occasioned in the Place, brought the Garrison to capitulate; wherein it was agreed, they should be transported to Lesser Asia▪ which on the 18th, together with a great Number of Turks, making in all 4000, embarked accordingly: And tho' the Ottoman Fleet appeared the next Day near Cape de Calaberno, yet, understanding how things went, they declined sighting, and retired. But, after all, this important Conquest of the Republick was not long-liv'd, as you will hear in the next Year. But before we end this,The Affairs of Poland. we are to see whether it has pro∣duced any thing memorable in Poland. I do not positively know whether it was the ill Consequence of the Jarrs that seemed to arise between His Polish Majesty and the Emperor the preceding Year, that the former sent an Envoy to Adri∣nople, who, early this Year, gave his Master an Account, that the Cham of Tartary had made him new Proposals for a separate Peace: But however it were, the Answer given, was, That the King of Poland would never break his Alliance with the Emperor and the Republick of Venice; and that it would be much more for the Advantage of both Parties to make a gene∣ral
Peace. And though some farther▪ Overtures were then made, or rather, indeed, talked of, towards a General one, it came to nothing: And so the War went on, on all sides, as we have already shewed in a great measure, and shall now only instance, That the Poles seemed still to be the faintest of the Allies, and they could not find themselves strong enough this Campaign to prevent the Enemy's relieving Caminie, with a numerous Convoy of 300 Waggons, laden with all manner of Ammunition and Provisions, and guarded by 20000 Tartanian Horse, most part of which carried a Sack of Corn behind them: But when they had so done, and were about to make a terrible. Ravage in the adjacent Provinces; the Poles, to defend their own, stood stoutly to it, and fell with such Fury upon them, eager of Prey, that they drove them back, with the Loss of near 3000 of their Number; where∣as theirs did not amount to above 300. I With this Success, or rather Deliverance, the Poles were so satisfied, that we heard no more of them all the rest of the Summer, tho' this happen'd towards the beginning of it.The death of the E∣lector of Saxony. But before I conclude, must observe, that this Year was fatal to the Elector of Saxony, a young Prince, and in the full Vigour of his Age, who died of the Small Pox, at Dresden, on the 7th of May, towards Evening, when it was thought he was out of Danger, and that he had that very Morning found himself so well as to walk about his Chamber. But I am about to present you with a more melancholy Scene than this:The death of Queen Mary. For, tho' His Majesty, upon his returning safe from Flanders, told his Parliament, in his Speech to them on the 20th of Nov. that their Affairs were (and Truth it was) in a much better posture, both by Sea and Land, than when they parted last; yet something quickly happen'd that reduced our Advantages so contemptibly little, that we were, in a manner, left disconsolate, and next to Despair: And what could that be, alas! but the Death of the best of Queens, the best of Wives, nay, the best of Women, our most Gra∣cious Sovereign Lady, Mary, Queen of Great Britain, France and Ireland, which happen'd on the 28th of December, at her Palace of Kensington, after she had lain some few Days sick of the Small-Pox. To attempt her Character would be Ar∣rogance in me, since it has been done so well by so many learned Pens. But I cannot omit remarking the Answer, as I have heard, His Majesty, who knew her best, was pleased to make the Archbishop of Canterbury, when he went to com∣fort him for his great Loss, That he could not chuse but grieve, seeing she had been his Wife for 17 Years, and yet he never knew her guilty of an Indiscretion. And, to add what most People are apt to pass over untouched, That she was certainly a Princess of real Piety, which I should not say, if I had not
known some Circumstances my self concerning her, upon that Account, that were evident tokens of it. Wherefore I shall end this unhappy Year with the Parliament and Nation's Condolance of the King, upon this great Loss, as himself was pleased to express it; and their Protestations to stand by him, against all Opponents whatsoever, both at home and abroad. And the Truth of it is, if ever Addresses were real and unfeigned, they were those made upon this Occasion, since it has been obvious to any Man of Observation, that that sad Providence did very much heighten Men's Affections to His Majesty's Person; which being before, as it were di∣vided between him and that beloved Princess, were now en∣tirely cemented into one. But tho' the Nation laboured under this great Sorrow for our unretrievable Loss, as we did also from the Badness of our Coin,The English Parliament's Proceedings. which had been a long growing Evil upon us, and began now to be very intolerable; yet there was no going back; And therefore the Parliament went roundly to work, and, besides some other useful Bills, had by the 11th of Feb. prepared for the Royal Assent. An Act for Granting 4 s. in the Pound to His Majesty: And for Applying the Yearly Summ of 300000 l. for Five Years, out of the Duties of Tunnage and Poundage; and other Summs of Mo∣ny, payable upon Merchandizes Exported and Imported, for Car∣rying on the War against France with Vigour. But what Zeal soever the two Houses, in general, shewed for the common Cause, there was such a Brangle at this time among them, especially in the Upper House, about sending of the Fleet to the Streights, that tho' some, under the specious Pretence of Good Will towards the Government; took upon them to shew the Inconvenience of it: Yet the major part of that most honourable Assembly shewed them∣selves to have far different Sentiments, by their Address of Thanks to the King for so ordering it. And it happen'd little favourably, as if it had been a Confirmation of their Lordships Judgments, that News came soon after, which gave an Account that some Frigats which Admiral Russel had sent out to cruise had taken 2 French Men of War, of the big∣ger Size, near Messina. So that the other Party was now obliged to acquiesce, and the Lovers of the Government to go on with the King's Business. But it was the middle of April, or thereabout, before there were any more Mony-Bills ready; when His Majesty signed, among divers others, An Act for enabling such Persons as had Estates for Life in Annuities, payable by several former. Acts therein mentioned, to purchase and obtain farther and more certain Interests in such An∣nuities: And in Default thereof, for Admitting other Persons to
purchase or obtain the same, for Raising Moneys for Carrying on the War against France. An Act for Granting to His Majesty certain Rates and Duties upon Marriages, Births and Burials, and upon Batchellors and Widowers, for the Term of 5 Years, for Carrying on the War against France. An Act for Granting to His Majesty several Additional Du∣ties upon Coffee, Tea, Chocolate and Spices, towards Satisfacti∣on of the Debts due for Transport-Service for the Reduction of Ireland. And then he was pleased to tell them, that the season of the Year was so far advanced, and the circumstances of affairs so pressing, that he very earnestly recommended unto them the speedy dispatching of such business, as they thought of most importance for the publick good, because he was to make an end of the Sessions in a few Days, which was done accord∣ly after the signing of some other Bills, which the Parlia∣ment had dispatched, and among the rest; An Act to grant unto the King, certain Duties upon Glass-wares, Stone and Earthen Bottles, Coal and Culm, for carrying on the War as before. Then it was that he told them, the necessity there was for his Presence abroad, but that he would take care to have the administration of Affairs, during his Absence, put into such Persons hands, on whose care and fidelity he could entirely depend, and that he doubted not, but they both Lords and Gentlemen in their several Stations, would be assisting to them, and that what it was he required of them, was to be more than ordinarily vigilant in preserving the publick Peace. In pursuance to this His Majesties Resolu∣tion, he was pleased before his Departure, which was on the 12th of May, to appoint in Council the Lord Archbishop, the Lord Keeper, the Earl of Pembrook, the Duke of Devonshire, the Duke of Shrewsbury, the Earl of Dorset, and the Lord Godolphin, to be Lords Justices of England, for the Admini∣stration of the Government during his Absence beyond the Seas; where, as before, he was Commander in Chief of all the Confederate Forces, which were this Campaign very strong, and out-numbred the French 20000 Men (which yet was no such odds, as to act offensively as they did) as the Duke de Villeroy was over the Armies of France, in the room of the Duke of Luxemburg, who died towards the beginning of this Year. There were two Camps formed for the Confederate Ar∣my,Th  Flanders. the one was at Arseel, to be commanded by the King in Person, and under him by the old Prince de Vaudemont, to whom His Majesty had given last Winter the Command in chief of his Armies, and the other at Ninove, under the Ele∣ctor of Bavaria, and the Duke of Holstein Ploen: The King
after his usual Divertion, went on the 27th of May from Bre∣da to Ghent, where the Inhabitants made great preparations to receive him, with demonstrations of Joy, suitable to what they owed to so great a King, and the Protector of their Country, and could not have done more to their own So∣vereign the King of Spain, had he come among them. But though the King ordered the Rendesvouz of his Army in the foresaid place, and that the Elector himself advanced towards the Scheld, yet it is very likely that at the very beginning of the Campaign, His Majesty's real design was to Besiege Na∣mur, for the Elector of Bavaria had Orders to Detach the Earl of Athlone with 40 Squadrons of Horse towards Lovain, and in lieu thereof, the King reinforced the Elector with some other Brigades; which being done, the King's Army marched from Arseel to Becelar. On the 3d of June, in the Evening, His Majesty went to view the Enemies Lines, where he found the main Body of their Army incamped within them, standing to their Arms, as expecting to be Attacked: But though there was no probability of Success, in forcing of their Lines, yet it was convenient for the Confederates, to further their Designs, to get the French to bring all their Forces for the defence of them, and therefore the Elector of Bavaria likewise decamped on the 4th of June from Ninove, and in∣camped on the 6th between the Lys and the Soheld, near the Lines also, but was quickly fronted here by the Marshal d Boufflers: So that things being in this disposition, and that the King could have easily bombarded Ipres, yet he thought it better if possible, to take in the Fort of Kenock, and to that end, the Duke of Wirtemburg was sent with a Detachment to Attack it: This though it was done with very great Appli∣cation and Vigour, and with the loss of a pretty many Men, and that he had possessed himself, after a long resistance, of the Redoubt Pintele, and lodged himself in the Intrenchment of a little Bridge upon the Canal, over against the Fort; yet finding at length it was impossible to hinder the communica∣tion of the Fort, with the Body under Montal, who lay so posted, that he could supply it with Men and Provisions as he pleased, it was judged unadvisable to lose any further time, which might be improved to better advantages. And there∣fore, the King and his Generals, finding that Villeroy would not stir out of his fastnesses, fully concluded upon the siege of Namur, and in order thereunto, the Army marched on the 19th to Rosalaer, where the King left them under the Prince de Vaudemont; and on that Day early in the Morning went towards the Meuse, in order to this great Work. There had been all this time vast preparations making at Maestricht of Artillery, Mortars, Bombs, and all manner of Ammuni∣tion, and all the Boats of the Meuse were detained at Liege,
Maestricht and Huy, for the service of the States. And tho' all this threatned Namur, yet the French had brought all their Forces within their Lines, without keeping any Body to guard the Passages of the Sambre: But however this came about, the King, who as we have said, was moving towards the Meuse, sent in the mean time Orders to my Lord of Athlone, encamped at Tilmont, and to the Brandenburg and Liege Forces now come as far as Falise upno the Mehaigne, to invest Na∣mur. My Lord of Athlone accordingly marched on the 17th Old Stile, with the body of Horse under his command, and incamped between Malevre and Perwys, on the 18th between la Falise and Templonee, where being joyned by the Branden∣burg Troops, he left a good Body of Horse next day at la Fa∣lise, and with the rest of the Troops marched towards Char∣leroy. This motion put the French in suspence whether the Confederates designed to Attack Namur or Charleroy, and made the Marquess of Harcourt, who had passed the Meuse near Dinant, to reinforce the Garrison of Charleroy with a Body of Dragoons: But my Lord of Athlone having passed the Sambre at Chasselet below Charleroy, marched again down the Sambre towards Namur, and pressed all the Boats upon the River, to make a Bridge of Communication, which were brought down to the Abby of Floref, upon the Sambre, 2 Leagues from Namur, so that the Earl took all the osts from the Sambre to the Meuse of the Town-side about la Falise: But all the other side of the Meuse lay open, for want of Troops enough to do it at once, which gave the Marshal de Boufflers an opportunity, with 8 Regiments of the best Dra∣goons in the Army, to throw himself into the place, but he sent back most of the Dragoons Horses. But while this was doing,Namur Be∣sieg'd by the Confede∣rates. the Elector of Bavaria's Army which was nearest, marched with wonderful Celerity to car∣ry on this famous Siege, so that all the Posts were taken about Namur, by the 23d of June, the King being come up the Day before to it. It is from this Day forward, that we must reckon the investing of it, and here before we go any fur∣ther, we are to observe, that the place had very much chang∣ed Conditions since it fell into the French Hands, who spared no Charges to put their Frontier Garrisons into the best De∣fence they could: Fortifi∣cations. For the Town at the time of their taking it, was but weak, being absolutely commanded by a steep Hill that hangs just over it from the Port de Fer, to that of St. Nicholas near the Meuse; so that they had the liberty to bring down their Batteries at first to the descent of that Hill, and to open their Trenches at the foot of it near the Meuse, so that it did not then hold out above 5 or 6 Days. But now to add a very considerable strength to this weak part of the Town, the French had made a detacht Eastion upon the ascent
of the Hill, before St. Nicholas Gate, all of Stone Work, with a Casemotte upon it, Bomb proof; the Counter-scarp of the French Fasse of Free Stone, and the covered way the same, which pointed just upon the top of the Hill; So that no Can∣non from the Plain could bear upon this Work upon the Hill, but the Confederates were necessitated to batter it in reverse from the other side of the Meuse, from the Brandenburg-Bat∣teries, which required some Time before they cold bring them to the Water-side. But this was not all; for upon the Right, towards the Port de Fer, they had made 2 or 3 de∣tached astions of the same Work, just upon the Brow of the Hill, and at the Foot of the same, before the Port de Fer; and between the Hill and the Brook of Werderin they had a 4th, which hinder'd the Avenues between the Hills, to this Gate. The Plain upon these Hills was fortified with a double Covered Way, Pallisadoed, to defend these detached Basti∣ons towards the Village of Bouge: And when the Confede∣rates were Attacking the place, they were working at a 3d nearer to the brow of the Hill, just before these Works, so that the Town which before was but weak, was now by these additional Works exceeding strong, and held out longer than the Castle. Again, the French attack'd the Castle and Cohorn-Fort up∣on the top of the Hill between the Sambre and the Meuse, and this they took care to fortifie afterwards, so as to leave it almost unattackable the same way they took it before. Co∣horn or William's Fort fell into their Hands by driving their Trenches round the Work along the bottom, between it and the Terra Nova, or Upper Castle; which Work being em∣braced, and all manner of Communication cut off, was forced to Surrender: But the French, to prevent such a Me∣thod of proceeding another time, built a strong Stone Re∣doubt just upon the top of the Hill, between the Cohorn and Terra Nova, with a Case-mott upon it Bomb-proof; and this Work commands all this Bottom unto the Sambre, before which Work they had also made a very good Covered Way, palli∣sadoed from the Angle of the Gorge of the Cohorn to the Brink of the Hill upon the Meuse: Add to this a very good Half-moon they had made upon the Curtain of the Horn∣work of the Terra Nova, besides their fortifying of the Devil's House, which flanks the sides of the Cohorn towards the Meuse with a strong Stone Redoubt; which place, when the Spani∣ards had it, had but a simple Retrenchment about it, and yet it held out 4 or 5 Days. From the upper part of the Cohorn, which is towards the Meuse, they had made a very good Covered Way that goes about before the forementioned Redoubt, to the Edge of the Hill upon the Meuse, they had undertaken a prodigious Line cut into a Rock, all along the
top of the Hill, near an English Mile in length, terminating upon the Edge of the Hill towards the Sambre, and the same Hill towards the Meuse, with two Redoubts at each end. The Line was finished, and the Redoubt towards the Meuse very forward; but that toward the Sambre was but just be∣gun, which they made up with Fascines upon the Arrival of the Confederates before the Place. And, in short, the Castle was so strongly fortify'd upon the top of the Hill with all these Outworks, that it would have been a very tedious piece of Work for the Confederates to have attack'd it this way; But the weak side of the Castle and Cohorn was towards the Sambre and the Town, and the French had not provided for an Attack on that side; so that all those prodigious Works fell into the Confederates Hands in less time than the French had taken this Place before, tho' then far inferiour to what it is now in Strength and Fortifications: To which if you add the Strength of the Garrison, being computed at near 14000 Men, and most of them the best Troops of France, headed by a Mareschal of France, and assisted by Major General de Megrigny, one of the ablest Engineers in Europe, it would look little less than a Wonder that the Confederates should carry it. But now its time to come to some Particulars. After the Place had been invested, the King ordered the Earl of Athlone, with most of the Cavalry, to the Plains of Flerus, and so to the Pieton, to consume the Forage that was there; and a good Reinforcement from the Army under Prince Vaudemont to march towards Namur, where, on the 27th of June, the Be∣siegers began to work on the Lines of Circumvallation, trace∣ing the Ruines of that which the French had made when they besieged the place; but for want of their Cannon coming up, they did not open their Trenches till the first of July, which was done without considerable Disturbance from the French: But by the 3d their Cannon began to play from a Battery of 3 Pieces of Cannon from the de Bouge against the Old Tow∣er, and from the Edge of the Height of St. Barbe: On the 4th a Detachment was sent to reinforce the Prince de Vaude∣mont, upon an Information, that the Duke de Villeroy design∣ed to attack him; who, to that end, had made his Army as strong as possible, and passing the Lys, advanced to St. Bar∣bon, of whose Motion the Prince being aware, he made a Movement of his Camp at Woutergaem, to bring his Right more to the Reer, to take up the rising Ground of Arseel, which he judged more defensible, and then ordered Retrench∣ments to be made upon the Left towards the Lys and Walken, as they also fortified all the rising Grounds upon the right of Arseel.
The Prince had then with him about 50 Battalions of Foot, and 51 Squadrons of Horse and Dragoons; and with these Forces he was then resolved to expect the Mareschal de Vil∣leroy; though the latter had near double the number, with which he was marching upon the 4th of July towards him, and came up early enough to have attacked him: But whe∣ther it was that he found the Prince's Camp so strongly for∣tifyed, or that he would not then hazard a Battle, or that he had Orders to stay till Montal had taken his Post in the Reer of the Prince's Right Wing, between Arseel and Wirk, to at∣tack him there, he remained in sight of them that Evening, expecting to have fallen upon the Prince very early in the Morning, and in a manner to have caught him in a Net, by invironing him on the Right.P. Vaude∣mont's gal∣lant Retreat. But the Prince being informed of Montal's Motion, and finding he had already passed the Thielt, wisely changed his Resolution of Fighting, and though the time was very urgent and pressing, he immediately with a most admirable Judgment, resolved upon and contrived a Retreat, and as he is a Person of very great foresight, he had wisely provided for such an Accident in the Morning, by or∣dering all the Baggage to load immediately, and to March by the way of Deinse to Ghent, that it might not embarrass the motion of the Army. First, the Prince ordered the Can∣non to be drawn off of the Batteries, and to March towards Deinse, which was done with that Secrecy, that the Enemy did not perceive it; for he had cunningly ordered the Artille∣ry to be moving from the Batteries all the Afternoon; so that when it went clear off, the Enemy thought it had been but the ordinary Motion: Then marched the two Lines of Foot upon the Left, along the Retrenchment; to cover which, the Prince ordered a Body of Horse to go and post themselves in the Retrenchment, as it was quitted by the Foot; the Foot at the same time marching out with their Pikes and Colours trailing, to conceal their going off. Neither did the Ene∣my perceive this Motion, till the Cavalry mounted again, and abandoned the Retrenchment: By which time the In∣fantry was got into the Bottom, between Arseel and Wouter∣ghem, marching towards Deynse. But while the Foot were filing off from the Retrenchment, the Prince ordered Mon∣sieur Overkirke, with the Right Wing of the Horse, inter∣lined with Collier's Brigade of Foot, to make a Line falling to∣wards Caneghem; extending himself from the Wind-mill of Arseel, towards Wink. And this Motion was in order to make Montal believe that this Line was designed to oppose his Attempt upon the Rear of the Prince's Right; but his secret Orders were, to march off by Wink, to Nivelle, and so to Ghent. At the same time that the Foot marched by Wouterghem and Deynse, the Earl of Rochford, who was posted
with the Left Wing of Horse and two Battalions towards the Lys, made the Rear-Guard towards the Left, with a Line of Foot upon the one side, and 3 Squadrons of Epinger's Horse upon the other. All this was so contrived by the Prince, from the Right to the Left, that the Army disappeared all at once, just as if it had vanished out of the Enemy's sight. The Prince and the Duke of Wirtemberg, with other Generals, kept to the Retrenchments till all were marched off; form∣ing, with their own Domesticks and Attendants, a little Bo∣dy of Horse, still to impose upon the French, and followed the Army as soon as it was all got off. The Enemy finding themselves thus so strangely amused, did what they could to overtake the Confederates, and fall upon their Rear: And particularly, Montal endeavoured to attack that Body which was commanded by my Lord Overkirke, whom he overtook with some Squadrons of Horse and Dragoons; but the Defiles were good, and Brigadeer Collier had ordered all the Grenadiers of his Brigade to the Rear of all, to face the Enemy from time to time, as they advanced, in their De∣files; which was so well contrived, that the Grenadiers, with their Fire, kept the French at a Distance, and made good the Retreat. They attempted the same thing upon the Rear of the Body of Foot, commanded by the Count de Noy∣elles, with the like ill Success. However, two Squadrons of their Dragoons, putting green Bows in their Hats, which was the Confederates Signal of Battle, and speaking some French, some English, as if they had been some of their own Rear-Guard, did by that means, towards Evening, come up close to their Rear, and marched along with them a little way, till they came to a convenient place, when they fired upon them first, and then fell in with their Swords, which put the first Battalion into some Disorder; But the other facing about, immediately constrained them to retire after they had killed a few Men, which was inconsiderable in Com∣parison of this great and renowned Retreat, which was as fine a piece of Art of War as can be read in History, and can hardly be parallell'd in it; and which shewed more the Art, Conduct and Prudence of a General, than if the Prince had gained a considerable Victory. And this was the Sense His Majesty was pleased to express of it, in a Letter he writ to Prince Vaudemont, on this Occasion; which is the same that follows: COUSIN, YOU cannot believe how much your Letter of Yesterday-Noon,The King his Letter to Prince Vau∣demont. which I received this Morning by Break of Day, disturbed me: On the other side, how joyful I was upon the Receipt of the other Letter, dated from Marykirk, near Ghent, this Day, at
3 in the Morning. I am much obliged to you; for in this Retreat you have given greater Marks of a General consummate in the Art of War, than if you had won a Battle. I absolutely approve your Conduct upon this Occasion; and hope it will hinder the Enemy from undertaking any more of the same nature. Nevertheless, I shall be impatient till I hear which Way they bend their March, since this Blow has failed them. I remain always, &c. The Prince having made his Retreat in this Order, and the Army being posted at Deynse, (where a Garrison was left, under Brigadeer O Farrell; as Dixmude was, with a good Number of Men, committed to the Care of Major-General Ellenburg,) and got as far as Nivelle, in his Way to Ghent, there were Orders given to halt, and rest there that Night; But the Prince, as he himself afterwards said, remembring a Maxim of that great General, Charles the Fourth, Duke of Lorrain, his Father, That when an Army is upon the Retreat, it must be sure to retreat out of the Enemy's Reach, they were or∣dered to decamp again; and the whole Army, by 2 next Morning, were got to Marykirk, under the Walls of Ghent; from whence the Prince sent a Reinforcement for the Securi∣ty of Newport: And here, at present we leave him, as we do the French Army at Roselaer, to see what is done at Namu, which we shall now prosecute in as concise a manner as we can, with little or no Intervention of other Actions, till the Surrender of the Town. The Besiegers,The Siege of Namur con∣tinued to the Surrender of the Town. as it has been said, having already invested the Place, and begun to raise their Lines of Circum vallation, this Work, because of the great Circuit of Ground it took up, kept the Soldiers and Pioneers employed from the 3d of July, to the 10th; so that on the 11th at Night the Trenches were opened against the Town in two Attacks, the one along the Meuse, and the other upon the adjacent Rising Grounds; the Enemy at the same time making a Sally, but they were repulsed with Loss. Next Night the Trenches were car∣ried on considerably, with no Loss; and so on to the 15th, when their Batteries were raised: And next Day the Trenches next the Meuse were advanced from one side to the other, and the Day following they advanced 300 Paces farther; at what time the Besieged fired very furiously, and made a Sal∣ly, and, after some Resistance, retired: But upon the 18th they made another Sally, about 3 in the Afternoon, with 1200 Horse, and 4 Squadrons of Dragoons; and crossing the Meuse, they fell upon the Trenches on the Right Hand of the Bridge belonging to that River, took a Re-doubt that was unfinished, and only stuffed with Sacks of Wool, and fell with great Fury, both in Front and Flank, upon the Besiegers,
who were forced at first to give way; But resuming fresh Courage, they were beaten back, with the Loss of 300 of their Men: Yet the Combat was also bloody to the Besiegers. How∣ever, the King finding that very Day that the Trenches were advanced within Fuzil-shot of the Counterscarp, he or∣dered the same to be stormed that Evening, an Hour before Sun-set; which was done by 5 Battalions of the Foot-Guards, commanded by Major-General Ramsey; seconded by 9 Bat∣talions more of English and Scotch; and on the Left, by 8 Dutch and other Regiments, under the Command of Major-General Salish. The Attack was made with extraordinary Bravery, and such Success, that the French, after a Dispute of near 2 Hours, were beaten out of their Works. The King, according to his usual manner, remained upon the Place du∣ring the whole Action, and had divers Persons slain about him; and particularly, Mr. Godfrey, Deputy-Governor of the Bank of England, who was come into the Camp to wait upon His Majesty about Mony for the Payment of the Army. The Confederates Loss was not very great, considering the Resistance the French made; but it was too much, the Kil∣led and Wounded amounting to near 800 Men. But this did not in the least daunt their Courage; so that their Trenches were on 19th advanced to the Village of Bouge, towards St. Nicholas Gate: The same thing being done also on that side next the Meuse, as well above as below, with a Design to draw two Parallels along the River on that side next the Su∣burbs of Jambe, and opposite to the Castle-Bridge; which made the French, who were apprehensive of the Design, to set fire to the Suburbs, which retarded the Approaches that General Cohorne had begun. On the 21st a Battery was finished on that side next St. Nicholas Gate, and the Trenches advanced 100 Paces towards the Rivulet that runs into the Bottom, which the French had swelled with Water, and which was secured with a kind of an Half-Moon. Next Day they began to play upon a Bastion, and the Works before St. Ni∣cholas Gate, from a Battery of 18 Pieces of Cannon: And on the 23d the Brandenburghers played upon the Water-stop, in order to let the Water out of the Moat, yet with little Ef∣fect, because it was lined with large Free-stone: But about this time the great Rains which fell, incommoded the Be∣siegers very much; However, on the 25th they continued pealing from their Batteries below the Village of Bouge, and on the other side of the Meuse, at the Brandenburgh Attack, and levelled the Works which they had attacked the 18th with their Cannon, and took in an Out-Bastian, where there was a kind of a Counterscarp, that same Night, constraining the French that defended it to surrender at Discretion. So that the Siege went on briskly; and the Besiegers, by the
27th in the Morning, being lodged at the Foot of the Re∣doubt of Ballart, made themselves Masters of it; and about 50 French that defended it, were made Prisoners: But this was not all, for, after much Resistance, they carried and lodged themselves on the foremost cover'd Way of St. Ni∣cholas Gate that Evening. But in regard the Meuse was low, and for that, by reason of the great Number of their Bat∣teries, they had made great Breaches in St. Nicholas Basti∣on, the Demi-bastion of St. Roch, and at the end of the Coun∣terscarp of the Town, they adventured to creep along the River, and to storm all those Posts, from whence they were three times repulsed, but at last they did prevail; For, af∣ter a Combat of 4 Hours, they not only lodged themselves upon the aforesaid cover'd Way, but upon the Point of the Counterscarp, on that side next the River: Yet it unhap∣pily fell out, that some Sacks of Wooll, wherewith the Be∣siegers secured themselves, took fire; which made them, for a time, lie open to the Firing of the Enemy; tho' they soon made another Lodgment. While this was doing here, the Elector of Bavaria was not idle between the Sambre and the Meuse, where, towards the Abby of Salsines, he not only forced the Entrenchments next the Sambre, but made him∣self Master of a Fort at the Head of those Entrenchments; where his Cuirassiers,  the Liegois and Spanish Cavalry signalized themselves very much, and vigorously repulsed 4 Squadrons that came out of the Castle, and had much ado to prevent their being surrounded: But this was not all; for, after the French had disputed the Water-stop almost all Night, the Besiegers at length possessed themselves of it. Then they laid a Bridge over the Sambre, in the midst of all the Ene∣my's Firing, tho' all this was not effected without considera∣ble Loss on both sides. But there was now no looking back; so that the 28th was employed in entrenching themselves in the Posts of the Bal∣lance and Abby of Salsines. And the same day 60 Grana∣diers and as many Musquetteers were commanded out of every Regiment, to make an Attack on that side, near the Iron-Gate; which the French at first sustained with great Courage, but they were at last forced to retire: And the same Evening the Line of Communication, near the Suburbs of Jambe, was attacked; so that the French were no longer in a Condition to make Sallies on that side. Next day was taken up in attacking two Lines the French had drawn before the Castle, between the Sambre and the Meuse; both which the Besiegers carried, one after another, with great Bravery; whose Work on the 30th, early in the Morning, was, to at∣tack the great Entrenchment of the Old Wall, between the Sambre and the Meuse, that still held out; which, after the
Besieged had made a long Resistance, by the Favour of a Line of Communication of one Redoubt and two Trenches, and being assailed both in Front and Flank, and that too with an extraordinary Bravery, the French were driven as far as the Counterscarp of Cohorne-Fort; But the Besiegers pursu∣ing them to the Devil's House, where the French had seve∣ral Cannon laden with Cartouches, and about 900 Men laid flat upon their Bellies; and they being now come within the Reach of those Guns, the Enemy let fly at them in a most dismal manner, but the Assailants withstood the Brunt with incredible Resolution; and after they had forced the French to quit the Counterscarp of the Fort, they made themselves Masters of it; yet not being able to keep their Ground, they retired in pretty good Order: But the French, in the mean time, found themselves necessitated to quit a Lined Redoubt, some advanced Batteries, and their Entrenchment from the Sambre to the Meuse. There was also the very same Day a Mine sprung at St. Nicholas Gate, which overturned a good part of the Water-stop, into the Moat of the City; and the Cannon played all the next Day, to widen the Breach. Now it was become the month of Aug. on the first day whereof, the Besiegers battered the Works, and the Breach that had been made at St. Nicholas Gate, from whence they threw a great many Bombs which did considerable Execution, and next day towards Evening, stormed the Half-moon, Co∣vert-way and Demi-bastion, that lay on the right Hand of the Gate, where the Breach had been made; and after be∣ing repulsed no less than 3 times, they at last lodged them∣selves on the Counterscarp, and carried on their Works as far as Fort William and the Devil's House; and next day all things being in a Readiness for a General Assault, Count Guiscard the Governour came himself, upon the Demi-bastion, where he ordered a White Flag to be put up in order to Capitulate. Thereupon all the Batteries were immediately ordered to be silent, and Colonel Mackarty, who waited up∣on Major General Ramsey, in the Trenches, was sent to the Breach to know what the Count desired, who asked to speak with the Major General himself, and there-upon coming to him, after mutual Civilities, the Count told him, That tho' the Necessity and Condition of their Affairs, was not such as to oblige them to Capitulate, yet for the Preservation of the Town, they were willing to give it up upon honourable Terms. Upon this, Ramsey acquainted the Duke of Holstein Ploen with it, whose Quarters was just by, and promised the Count an An∣swer in an Hours time, in which the King having Notice, he sent back Ramsey with Power to exchange Hostages, and an Express was sent to the Elector of Bavaria to give him No∣tice
of it, and to Commission a Person to treat about the Surrendry; So that after some Contestation, the Capitula∣tion was signed the next Day, being the 4th of Aug. upon honourable Terms. And here, for the present, we shall leave Namur, and give the Confederates a breathing time for the Siege of the Castle, and see how it fared with the French else-where. But if the Confederates seemed thus to grow over the French by Land,The Mari∣time Towns of France Bombarded by the Eng∣lish. the latter were much more despicable by Sea, where they had no Fleet in the Channel, and the Eng∣lish and Dutch at full Liberty to insult them in their own Ports, as they did divers ways. And first, they began with St. Malo's, where the Lord Berkley with the Fleet, under his Command, arrived on the 4th of July, gave the Signal next day for the Frigats to stand in to the Channel with the Bomb Galliots, and to attack the Town; Whereupon Captain Bembow, going on Board the Charles Gally by 6 in the Morn∣ing, was ready to Sail, as Captain Durley at the same time, Commander of the Fire-ship, called the Charles, and a Dutch Fire-ship, had Orders to bear up with the Rock de la Coucee and attack it, and afterwards to set fire to the Vessel, which was vigorously put in Execution, and a little after the Fort took Fire, but whether by the burning of the Fire-ships or the fall of the Bombs is uncertain: However it were, the Fire lasted for two Hours, but this was not enough; for our Galliots and Frigats having got in about 7 in the Morning, the former stood in so near, that in charging the Bombs, they were forced to lessen the weight of the Powder, other∣wise they would have gone beyond the Mark; So that about 10, the Fire took in several parts of the East-end of the Town, and about 2 in the Afternoon, they could see a great Fire, kindled in the middle of the Town, that continued burning till Night, and could not be quenched without blow∣ing up several Houses that were near. They threw no less than 900 Bombs into the place, a great part of which was reduced to Ashes, and the English were perhaps the more forward, in putting this design in Execution, because we had suffered more in our Traffick and Navigation by the Priva∣teers of this place, than from all the Ports of France besides: But though the English might, and really did Exaggerate in some measure the French loss, they on the other hand, made it so diminitively little, as to appear in it self very ridicu∣lous. Granville another Town, not far from it, ran the same fate, and some of the French themselves have frankly ac∣knowledged this place to be reduced to Ashes. But how different soever the Relations may be in respect to these places,Dixmude and Deinse Surrendred to the French. as they were afterwards, as to the Bombing of Calais, which hapned to be about the middle of Aug. and
the design upon Dunkirk, the French Court did not like them, as we shall see by and by, to whose Army under Mounsieur Villeroy we are now returning, and see whether their Acqui∣sitions did in any degree counterballance the Losses they had already sustained, and whereof more was to follow. After the Mareschal had failed in his Design upon Prince Vaudemont, as also against Newport, as we have before Noted, he chose rather to play at a small Game, than to stand out; and therefore he order'd Montal to lay Siege to Dixmude, which though of it self but a very weak Place, yet considering the Goodness of the Garrison, it might have made a better De∣fence, or at least have got better Conditions, than to be made Prisoners of War: But if there was any Treachery in the matter, the Governour, Major General Ellenburg paid dear for it, with the Loss of no less than his Head, and the Garrison with hard Usage, and a tedious Imprisonment by the French, who would not release them according to the Cartell, till another Accident hapned that brought them to a better Temper. Deinse, also a Defenceless place, and its Garrison ran the same Fate; but though this came vastly short of Namur; yet the Damage done to Brussells, as it was of the same nature with our attacking the Maritime Towns of France, so the same was very considerable: But Mon∣sieur Villeroy being come to Anderleck, would first, to shew his Civility and his Master's Goodness, send a Letter to the Governour, the Prince of Berghen, Dated Aug. 13th, to this Purpose: THE King being full of Goodness towards his Subjects, and Care to contribute to their Defence, seeing the Prince of Orange sends his Fleet upon the Coasts of France, to Bombard his Sea-Port Towns, and endeavour to Ruin them, without get∣ting any other Advantage by it, has thought that he could not put a stop to such Disorders, but by using Reprisals; which is the Reason that His Majesty has sent me an Order to come and Bom∣bard Brussels; and at the same time to declare, that 'tis with Re∣luctancy that the King has put himself upon it; and that as soon as he shall be assured, that the Sea-Ports of France shall be no more Bombarded, the King likewise will not Bombard any Places belonging to the Princes against whom he is at War, reserving ne∣vertheless the Liberty on both sides, to do it in such Places as shall be Besieg'd. His Majesty has resolved upon the Bombarding of Brussels, with so much the more Pain, that the Electress of Ba∣varia is there: If you will let me know in what part of the Town she is, the King has commanded me to forbid to fire there. I shall stay for your Answer till Five of the Clock in the Even∣ing; after that, I shall obey the Orders the King has given me with∣out delay.
The Contents of this Letter were looked upon very strange, and as it gave an evident Proof of the Damages done their Sea-Port-Towns by our Fleet, and that the same did very much affect them, so the Compassion pretended for the safe∣ty of this City, was irreconcileable to the Course of their Actions, during the whole Management of the War: How∣ever, the Prince, after having Communicated this Letter to the Elector of Bavaria, who was come in great haste to Brus∣sels upon this Occasion from the Camp before Namur, sent the following Answer: THE Declaration you have sent me of the Orders you have from the King your Master, to Bombard the Town of Brus∣sels, and the Reason which his said Majesty does alledge, upon which you demand an Answer, it cannot be given by his Electo∣ral Highness, who is just now arriv'd, since it regards the King of Great Britain, who is before the Castle of Namur; but his Electoral Highness will acquaint him with it, to have an An∣swer in 24 Hours, if you agree to it. As for the Consideration his Most Christian Majesty has for the Electress, she is at the King's Palace. I need not tell the World the Fate of this poor City,Brussells Bombarded. the French Bombs having had but too much Success in reducing a great part of it to Ashes; But with this, they were not yet satisfied, to relieve Namur was their great design, to which end, Villeroy being reinforced with all the Troops that could be spared out of the Garrisons, and the Forces from the Sea Coasts; and in Expectation of a strong Detachment from the Rhine, which some-time after joined him, he march∣ed directly that way with this grand Army, which, as them∣selves gave out, was no less than an 100000 Men, and with which they boasted to do the Work effectually, and so give Peace to Christendom: But herein they were grosly mistaken, for besides that Prince Vaudemont, in conjunction with the Earl of Athlone, was got before them to the strong Camp of Massy, the Confederates had also a strong Detachment from the Rhine, to join them under the Command of that brave Prince, the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel; So that the Siege of the Castle went briskly on, and the Camp was strongly For∣tified at the same time, and His Majesty was present in both, as there was occasion. For as to the former, when all things were got ready, the Trenches were opened against Cohorn Fort, the 13th of Aug. at Night, with 900 Pioneers, and they began to play from no less than 12 Batteries, when one their Bombs falling upon the Magazine of the Devil's House blew up above 1000 Granadoes charged, ruined a great quantity of Arms, and killed and wounded several Persons
according to the report of Deserters; and notice being come on the 14th, that all the Horses in the Castle stood ready Sadled, and that Monsieur Boufflers, had a design to break through the Camp with his Cavalry, the King there∣upon ordered good Guards to be set at all places where the Sambre could be past; the same being done all along the Meuse by General Fleming, which prevented the said Enter∣prize. The Trenches were carried on the following days with great Success, though the Enemy fired furiously in the Night-time, both with their great and small Shot, and made Sallies to disturb the Work-men, but were still repulsed. And now it proved to be very hot Work on both sides, and the Besiegers at length ordered their matters so well, that they brought no less than 191 Pieces of Cannon and Mor∣tars, to play upon the Fort and Castle, but the Besieged be∣gan now to be more remiss in their Firings. However, on the 18th, they made a Sally with 200 Dragoons, mounted, and 500 Granadeers, whereof an 150 of the latter made their Attack on the right Hand, but were repulsed by the Count de Ribera; then upon the left, where my Lord Cutts had just posted the advanced Guards to secure the Work∣men, and a 100 Dragoons fell upon Lieutenant Sutton, who being posted in the Plain of Salsine, with 37 Fuzileers, let them come on till they were very near him, and then giving them a round Volley, retreated to his Body, but the Dra∣goons pressing upon him, they fired upon them a second time, when the Spanish and Bavarian Horse falling on among them with down-right Blows, drove them to the very Gate of the Castle, killing some and making others Prisoners: But the French Army being in the mean while come as far as Flerus, to the Besieged's succour, that the latter might be∣lieve they were in earnest, they gave them a Signal of this Approach, by a discharge of 90 Pieces of Cannon, which was answered with a great number of Lights and Fugees from the top of the Castle. This obliged the King to leave the Care of the Siege to the Elector, and the Duke of Hol∣stein Ploen, and to repair to the Army with a Resolution to oppose the French, who seemed now fully bent to fight him. In order to this, the Marshal de Villeroy drew out his Army in formal Array, and attacked the advanced Guard of the Confederate Horse, for the gaining of an advantageous Post, which obliged the King to keep the Field, from 4 in the Morning, till 8 at Night, but the Marshal being repulsed by the Hessian Horse,Villeroy fails to re∣lieve Na∣mur. and finding it would not do that way, he retired without any Noise in the Night, and next day was seen moving along the Mehaign, extending his Right Wing to Perwys, and his Left to Bonefse, as the King at the same time advanced with his Army towards Ostin and that way, to
observe his motion. But tho' his Majesty saw them now se∣cure from the Assaults of Villeroy from without, yet besides the troublesomeness of such a Neighbour, scarcity began to creep into his Camp, wherefore upon the 19th of Aug. his Majesty with the Elector of Bavaria, Prince Vaudemont and other General Officers, concerted a General Assault for next day; the disposition and manner whereof was as followeth. My Lord Cutts, with 3000 English, was to attack the Counterscarp and Breach of the Terra Nova, and that part of the Line of Communication between the Cohorne and the Terra Nova, which was next to the Terra Nova. The Count de Rivera was to attack the Breach of the Cohorne, and that part of the aforesaid Line of Communication, next the Co∣horne, with 3000 Bavarians, and Others. Major General la Cave was to attack on the Right of Count Rivera, with 2000 Brandenburgers, the upper Point of the Cohorne, and part of the Cohorne, and part of the Communication to the Casotte. Major General Swerin was to attack the Casotte with 2000 Dutch; and at the same time a Colonel was to attack the Lower Town with 600 Men. The Signal was to be a con∣siderable Quantity of Powder, blown up upon the old Bat∣tery near the Brussels Port; and the Word of Battle given by the Elector of Bavaria, was, God with Vs. The Directions given by the Elector of Bavaria to the aforesaid General Of∣ficers, that were to command the respective Attacks in chief, were as follows: That a certain number of Men should be commanded in each Attack upon the Forlorn Hope, another number to sustain them, and the rest to be upon the Reserve; and as to Par∣ticulars, he left it to each General Officer, Commanding in Chief, to do as his own Judgment, and the Occasion, should direct him; only it was ordered that Count Rivera's Attack, and those upon the Right of him, should begin some Minutes before the English Attack, because that was like to be the most difficult. The Lord Cutts, the Night before the Attack, received a Detachment from the King, of 1000 chosen Men, which were to be part of his 3000: For his Majesty was now at the Head of the Confederate Army, and had left my Lord Cutts to command all the English that stayed with the Duke of Bavaria to carry on the Siege. It was ordered by the Duke of Bavaria, the Night before the Action, That all the Troops designed for the several Attacks, should march into the Trenches before day, there to lie undiscovered till the Hour of Signal. The Lord Cutts, in pursuance of this Or∣der, marched into the Trenches with his Men some Hours before day; but there not being room enough to cover all his Men, he was forced to place 3 Regiments at the Abby
of Salsen, which was the nearest Place to the Trenches where they could lie undiscover'd. The Disposition which my Lord Cutts made for the English, was as follows: He commanded 4 Serjeants, each with 15 Men (promi∣sing, in his Majesty's Name, Advancement to the Serjeants, and Rewards to the private Men, if they did their Duty) to go upon the Forlorn Hope: These were to be followed by the Granadiers of the Guards, under the Command of Co∣lonel Evans; and those by the rest of the Granadeers design∣ed for the Attack of the Breach, making in all 700, under the Command of a Colonel; 300 Granadeers were ordered to Attack the Line of Communication. Colonel Courthop, and Colonel Mackay's Regiments, were ordered to sustain those that attack'd the Breach: Colonel Hamilton and Colonel Buchan's Regiments were to make the Reserve. And that this might be the better performed, it was ordered that the Regiments of Mackay, Hamilton, and Buchan, which were placed at the Abby of Salsen, should immediately after the Signal given, march to the Place of Action, and draw up be∣hind the Regiment of Courthop, there to receive further Or∣ders. About Noon, or soon after, the Attack was begun; the English marching out of the Trenches, drew up under the Enemies Fire; and notwithstanding they had 900 Paces march before they came to the Breach, exposed all the way to the Enemies great and small Shot, which fired sorely up∣on their Flank all the way, they went on with a great deal of Firmness and Resolution. Immediately after the Grana∣deers followed Colonel Courthop's Regiment, with Drums beating and Colours flying. The beginning of this Attack looked very hopeful; but the 3 Regiments at Salsen not marching so soon as was in∣tended, (either by a Failure of, or Mistake in the Signal,) the English Troops that were already engaged, were over∣power'd by the Numbers of the Enemy: And that which contributed to their Misfortune, was, the Count de Rivera's being shot dead upon the Spot; the Count de Marsilly, (who commanded the 600 Men that were to attack the Line of Communication next Cohorne,) with his Lieutenant Colonel, being both immediately shot dead; Colonel Courthop being likewise shot-dead, and his Lieutenant Colonel, Sir Matthew Bridges, desperately wounded; most of the Officers of the Granadiers being killed or wounded, particularly, Captain Mitchel, of the Guards, shot dead; and Colonel Evans des∣perately wounded; my Lord Cutts receiving a Shot in his Head, which disabled him for some time; the Count de Mercie, Colonel Windsor, Colonel Stanhop, Mr. Thompson, and several other Gentlemen, who went Voluntiers with my Lord Cutts, in this Action, being wounded, and totally dis∣abled.
And Count Rivera's Attack not beginning quite so soon as was intended, (by Reason of the aforesaid Mistake of the Signal,) all the Fire of that part of the Cohorne which was next the Terra Nova, fell upon the English, which had been otherwise employed, if every thing had succeeded as was in∣tended. After some time, the 3 Regiments from Salsen ar∣rived; but things were then in such a Posture, that they were forced to begin a new Attack, instead of sustaining that already begun; for Count Nugent and Monsieur L' Ab∣adie were by this time come down, by Order of the Mares∣chal de Boufflers, (as we were afterwards informed by the French Commanders,) into the Space which is between the Cohorne and Terra Nova, with 1200 Foot and Dragoons of the French King's Houshold; and with these Troops they charg∣ed our Forces in Flank and Rear, which were already in the middle of 6 different Fires. The Battalions from Sal∣sen, tho' they came too late to do us the Service intended, did not want their Share of Suffering, as appeared by the List of their killed and wounded Officers and Soldiers. By this time, my Lord Cutts being dressed of his Wounds, and come to himself, finding the Affair of the Terra Nova not possible to be retriev'd, and observing the Bavarians upon Count Rivera's Attack, engaged in a very hot Fire, who (notwithstanding Count Rivera was kill'd, and the Prince of Holstein Norburg, Brigadier, wounded; and that most of the Officers of the Bavarian Guards were killed or wounded) had fixed themselves upon the outermost Retrenchment of the Point of the Cohorne next to the Sambre, and maintain'd the Post with a great deal of Obstinacy, but could not gain any more Ground; He ordered 200 Men to be detached out of such as were resolved to carry the Point, or die by it, upon Promise of distinguishing Rewards to such as should do any extraordinary Action; and ordering those to be sustained by the Regiment of Mackay, and that the other English For∣ces should rally and come after as soon as they could, he re∣solving to bend his whole Force to make good the Bavarian Attack: And as soon as he was come to the Place of Action, he detached Lieutenant Cockle, of Mackay's Regiment, with a Party of chosen Men, with the following Orders: That he should attack the Face of the saillant Angle, next to the Breach, Sword in Hand, without firing a Shot, that he should pass the Pallisadoes, and enter the cover'd Way▪ That if he could not maintain the Post, he should make the best Retreat he could with his Men, but that he should lodge himself, if he found any Place capable of it, with a Promise in his Majesty's Name, of a distinguishing Reward if they succeeded, and out-liv'd it. At the same time he commanded the Ensigns of Mackay's Regiment to march
straight to the Pallisadoes, and plant their Colours upon them, with Promises of suitable Rewards. All this succeeded so well, that Lieutenant Cockle entring the Pallisadoes, beat the Enemy from the cover'd Way, and lodg'd himself in a Bat∣tery of theirs, having first turn'd their Cannon upon them, for which his Majesty has since Rewarded him with Ad∣vancement and Money. Whilst Colonel Mackay's Ensigns were advancing to the Pallisadoes, the Bavarians renewed their Attack with undaunted Vigour, (tho', as was said before, most of their Officers were killed and wounded) and so this Post was made good. The Elector of Bavaria expos'd himself to a Degree not to be imagin'd, going from place to place to observe what pass'd, and give such Orders as he thought fit, several Per∣sons being killed and wounded very near him; he gave away Handfuls of Gold to the English Soldiers, as well as his own, saying many kind things of the Bravery both of the Of∣ficers and Soldiers. No Gentleman ever fell more generally lamented, than Colonel Courthop did on this Occasion, giving all possible Hopes of an extraordinary Man in the Military Art, if he had lived. Colonel Windsor, Colonel Stanhop, the Count de Mercy, Mr. Tomson, (eldest Son to my Lord Tomson) and other Gentlemen of Note before-mention'd, behaved themselves on this Occasion with all the Bravery it was pos∣sible for Men to shew. And many other remarkable Actions were done by several of the English and Scotch, too many to set down here. Having gained the cover'd Way before the Breach of the Cohorne, and the inferiour Angle saillant, or Point towards the Sambre, and our Troops being fatigued by so long an Assault, and the Enemies Resistance, we content∣ed our selves to make a Lodgment here, without any farther Attempt upon the Breach. Upon this Re-inforcement of Dutch and Bavarians, at this Attack, by my Lord Cutts, and the English Troops under his Command, the Enemies were so employed in the Defence of this most dangerous Post, as very much facilitated Major General la Cave's Enterprize upon the cover'd way before the Ravelin, and upper Point of the Cohorne, and so on towards the Casotte, where he lodg'd himself without any considerable Loss. Major General Swerin commanding the Right Attack of all, before the Casotte, and so towards the Muse, designing to beat the Enemies from the cover'd Way, and Retrench∣ment between the Casotte and the Muse, (which reaches to the Brow of the Hill, which has here a very steep Descent to the River) over-came the Enemies Resistance, and made a very good Lodgment all along this cover'd Way and Re∣trenchment of about 300 Paces, which he extended to the Left, turning in towards the Cohorne, about 140 Paces more,
to join it to that of Major General la Cave, which reached to the Ravelin of the Cohorne. The Dutch and Bavarians (commanded at first by Major General Rivera) carry'd it to the Angle saillant, or inferiour Point of the Cohorne towards the Sambre; and our rally'd Forces continued it to the other side of this Angle before the Breach, so that our Men were now Masters of one of the greatest Lodgments that ever has been made in one Assault, being near an English Mile in length; Tho' they miscarried in the great Design of this General Storm, (which was to have taken the Castle, with all its prodigious Out-works, by Assault) for want of a due Correspondence among our several Attacks, either by the Failure or Mistake of the Signals. Such a vast Lodgment could not be done in a Moment, the Assault lasted till the Evening, nor could it be gained without Loss. I have not seen the particular List of the Foreigners, but the Chief Of∣ficers among them killed, were Count Rivera, Major Gene∣ral of the Bavarians, and Envoy Extraordinary from the Ele∣ctor of Bavaria, to condole his Majesty upon the Death of our late most Gracious Queen; Monsieur de Marsilly, Colo∣nel commanding the Regiment du Theil, and Fabrice, Lieu∣tenant Colonel; Colonel Lindroot, of the Brandenburghers; and Heckeren, of the Dutch. Their Chief Officers wound∣ed, were, the Prince of Holstein Norburg, Brigadier; the Colonels Lindsburg, Caunits, Horne, d' Ohna and Denhoff; and Monsieur de Millune, Colonel of a Swiss Regiment; be∣sides a great many Lieutenant Colonels, Majors, Captains, and Subaltern Officers. The General Computation in those Times, was, that it cost the Besiegers between 1500 and 2000 Men; and about two Thirds of that Number to the Besieged; tho' without any Certainty. However it were, there was now no look∣ing back for the former; and therefore the Cannon thun∣der'd continually against the Castle the two succeeding days; and they continued to work hard to bring their Mine to Per∣fection under the Breach of the Cohorne, when on the 22d, about Noon, the Besieged beat a Parly to bury their Dead that had been slain in the last Assault: But now at length con∣sidering how hard they were pressed, both from within, and from without, and that there was no likelihood of being re∣lieved, they turned their Thoughs wholly to Capitulate; to which end, the Count de Guiscard came upon the Breach a little before the Cessation was over, and called for the Major General of the Trenches, and told him, That he de∣sired to speak with the Elector of Bavaria; who, having im∣mediately Notice, went there-upon to the Breach; to whom the Count offered to surrender the Cohorne-Fort: But his Electoral Highness refusing to Capitulate for any part, but
the whole; the Count replied, That the Mareschal de Bouf∣flers commanded in the Castle, and that he would let him know; and desired, that in the mean while the Cessation might be continued: The Result of this was, an Agreement to surrender all upon honourable Terms, and the Exchange of Hostages. Whereupon, an Express was immediately dis∣patched, to give the King an Account thereof, at Ostin; but his Majesty, with the Prince de Vaudemont, was then coming to the Siege, in his Coach, to order a second Assault; when he met the Express by the Way. The Capitulation was agreed on, and signed that very Night; and the Count de Guiscard obliged the Mareschal de Boufflers to sign it,The Fort and Castle of Namur surrendred. because he had commanded in the Castle during the Siege; whereas the Count had only commanded in the Cohorne, and the Out-works, and so could not sign for the Surrender of the other part. And perhaps this was the first Capitulation that was ever signed by a Mareschal of France; and so much the more to the Honour of the Confederate Arms, who took this almost impregnable Place from a compleat Army with∣in it, headed by a Mareschal of France, in the sight of 100000 Men without, that came to relieve it, but could only re∣main Spectators of their Bravery: As it was to the Amaze∣ment of the French themselves, who had made such additional Fortifications to it, as they presumed could never be forced; and therefore they set up this Inscription over one of its Gates, Reddi, non vinci potest. But none can pretend to so much Glory from this Conquest, as the King of Great Britain, under whose Conduct and Direction all was happily atchieved; it being unversally acknowledged by all, as well Enemies as Friends, That no Siege was ever carried on with greater Regularity. The same Evening that the Castle capitulated, Orders were given in his Majesty's Camp, for all the Officers to lie in their Clothes, and the Soldiers to do the same, with their Arms ready; and 60 Men out of each Battalion were commanded to re-inforce the Pass at Massy: All this being done, to prevent all manner of Surprize from the Enemy, who, upon the News of the Capitulation, might have pre∣sumed upon the Confederates Negligence, and fall upon them; or they might have been prompted to it by their own Despair: But they were so far from the one, or the other, that the Mareschal de Villeroy, when he had notice of the Capitulation, was so extremely concerned at it, that for some Hours he would admit no Body to him; and at length he marched away to the Plains of Flerus, with so much Haste and Precipitation, that he left many of his Foragers and Out-guards behind him. But if the Mareschal had Reason thus to be sorry, and to precipitate his Retreat, the Confederrtes had no less cause of Rejoycing; and therefore,
after they had taken Possession of the Cohorne, they prepar∣ed all things forthwith to discharge their Guns for Joy; for dispersing their Men in their several Posts, from Massy to the Meuse, along their Retrenchments: The Confusion of the Fire from so many different Places, was very agreeable; and the Tripple Discharge of their Small-shot seemed to be but one, of a long Continuance. And now it is time we should come to the Evacuation of the Place, and to give an Account of the Garrisons of Dix∣mude and Deynse, which were detained Prisoners in France, contrary to the Cartel; and how the Confederates found themselves in a Condition to get Reparation for the same. The 26th of Aug. being the day prefixed for the Garrison to march out, 4 Brigades of Foot were commanded to make a Lane on both sides the Terra Nova, up the Hill, and so down again to the Muese, to the way that leads to Givet; a Bridge of Boats being laid over the Sambre, between the Fax Bourgh, St. Croix, and the Town, for the King to come over, to be present at the Marching out of the Garrison; and like∣wise for the Troops encamped on the other side, if there had been Occasion. About 10 a Clock the March began: The Mareschal de Boufflers's Guard du Corps went out first, then his Domesticks, and next himself, with the Count de Guiscard, the Governor, at the Head of the King's and Al∣feld's Dragoons, as many as were mounted, being between 70 and 80 in all. His Majesty was on Horse-back, with the Elector of Bavaria before the Breach, and were saluted by the Mareschal and Count, with their Swords; when present∣ly Monsieur Dickvelt, who had been acquainted with the Ma∣reschal, in his Embassies in France, accosted him, and rid with him to the Top of the Hill, where Monsieur L' Etng, Brigadier of the Brigade of the Life Guard, rid up to him, with about 12 Gentlemen of the Life Guard, and Arrested him, in his Majesty's Name, for Satisfaction for the Garri∣sons of Dixmude and Deynse: At which the Mareschal seemed at first very much incensed, alledging the Publick Faith of the Capitulation, wherein he was expresly mentioned; saying▪ That the French King, his Master, would resent this Treatment of a Man of his Character, and revenge it to the utmost of his Power: And that, for his part, he had defended the Place li a Man of Honour, and did not deserve it. To whom Monsieu Dickvelt replied, That the French King, his Master, by detain∣ing the Garrisons of Dixmude and Deynse, contrary to the C∣pitulations, which made them Prisoners of War, and consequen should have been discharged within the Time limitted, paying the Ransom, which was offered, had forced them to that Way of de∣manding Satisfaction for the Infractions of the said Capitulations. That tho' he was Arrested, it was not out of any Dis-respect his Person and Character, but on the contrary▪ for when it
proposed to his Majesty of Great Britain to detain the whole Gar∣rison by way of Reprisal, the King had expressed so much Value for his Person, that he looked upon him as a sufficient Caution to Answer for 6000 Men, the Number of the two Garrisons of Dixmude and Deynse. But at the same time he offered him his Liberty, by his Majesty's Order, if he would pass his Word for sending back the said Garrisons, or return himself, a Prisoner, within a Fortnight, &c. To which the Mares∣chal answered, That he could not pass his Word of Honour in a Matter which he could not execute himself; but that it was in vain to resist. Whereupon, he put up his Sword, and went back, with his Domesticks, to Namur; where the Earl of Portland gave him a Visit, and told him, as from himself, That he made no doubt of his Releasement upon his Paroll of Ho∣nour, as aforesaid. To which the Mareschal answered, That in regard he knew not the Reasons why his Master detained those Garrisons, he could not engage for any thing. From Namur, he was conducted to Maestricht, and treated in both Places with all the Civility and Respect due to his Quality. But his Confinement was of no long Duration; for, upon the Return of his Gentleman of the Horse, whom he had sent to give his Master an Account of what had happen'd, (who thereupon gave the Confederates an Assurance of the Dis∣charge of the fore-mentioned Garrisons,) he was immediate∣ly released; as our Men were in some convenient time af∣ter. With this, concludes the Campaign Flanders, which we shall leave for this Year, as we do his Majesty, to go to his usual Diversion, and then for England. Whether, by a Sympathy of Success in the several Parts of their Dominions, the Spaniards, who all along had been on the losing Side in Catalonia, and more especially the last Year, as we have already noted in its proper place, seemed now, contrary to most Men's Expectations, to Bully the French: And to this purpose, 4 Squadrons of Miquelets re∣ceiving Advice that a Detachment of French were marching from Bagnoles to Gironne, they encounter'd them in the Way, and put them to the total Rout. With this Success they were so flush'd, that understanding that St. Silvester was up∣on his March with 8000 Men, to re-victual Castle-Follet, with a Convoy of all sorts of Provisions, the Lading of 3 or 400 Mules; a Body of Spaniards, in Conjunction with the Miqui∣ets, advanced towards the French, and attacked them with so much Courage, that they killed above 2000 upon the place, nd took between 5 and 600 Prisoners, besides all the Mules, xcept about 30 which escaped into the Castle during the Heat of the Fight, which lasted 6 Hours. And this News was so much the more welcome to Spain, in that it was se∣conded with the Catalonians and Miquelets routing another ody of about 2000 French, who were marching from Pras
de Melo, to join the 8000 that were beaten before. If the Spaniards had gone on as they begun, they would have made something of it. 'Tis true, that after this Action, they more closely blocked up Castle-Follet, with a Design to starve it, and not to take it by Force: But, alas! they could not hinder the Duke of Vendosme from putting Relief into it af∣ter all, and to make their Forces retire from it, with some Loss. Neither had they any better Success before Palamos, tho' the Place was invested by Sea by the Fleet under the Command of Admiral Russell, as well as by Land by the Spa∣nish Army, with the Additional Force of near 5000 Men from on Board the Fleet. The French Accounts were, That the Duke of Vendosme marching to the Relief of it the first time, found himself too weak; but being re-inforced with more Troops for that purpose, the Spaniards no sooner un∣derstood his Intentions, but they drew off their own Forces and the Re-inforcement from on Board the Fleet returned thither again. But the Truth of the Matter was, that the Place must have been given up in a day or two at farthest, had not the Fleet been constrained to bear away upon Infor∣mation received, That Monsieur Tourville, with the French Fleet, was upon coming out of Thoulon, with a Design to sail for the Ocean; though, after all, it proved to be only an Amusement of the French, as appeared by the Conse∣quence. The Campaign was not so inconsiderable in Catalonia,The Cam∣paign on the Rhine incon∣siderable. but that it was much more so upon the Rhine; where the French, being at first superiour to the Prince of Baden, would have made the best of the Opportunity, but to little pur∣pose; for the Prince, till he was reinforced, kept close with in his Trenches; and then he, in his Turn, did all he could to oblige the French to a Battel, but with the like ill Suc∣cess. And so we shall pass into Italy,Casall be∣sieged and taken by the Confede∣rates. where the Campaign was less favourable to the French, than in Germany, by their losing of Casall; which served as a considerable Augmentation of the Disadvantages which happen'd to them this Year, which, to say the Truth of it, looked upon them with an evil Aspect almost every Way. This important Place had been blocked up a long time by the Confederate Forces; all the Noise this Spring, was, the formal Besieging of which, at length, was put in Execution about the middle June, when the Trenches were opened before the Cittadel as they were also a little while after before the Town: that before the end of the Month, the Imperialists and Pul∣montois had carried on their Approaches so far, that the were in hopes in a short time to lodge themselves upon Classis of the Counterscarp of the Cittadel. By the 5th July, they began to play with their Bombs upon the Cittdel,
and the Out-works; while the Spaniards, also on their side, plyed the Besieged with a Battery of 10 great Mortars; and in a few days the Bombs and Carcasses had very much endamaged both the Town, and the Out-works; which was still the more increased by the Imperialists and Piedmontois springing of two Mines under the Classis of the Counterscarp of the Cittadel, with that good Success, that they carried the Pallisadoes and the Half-Moon by Storm; as they did also the Counterscarp. After this, there were Orders given on the 9th, to draw a Parallel Line athwart the Classis of the Cittadel; and the Work was so effectually carried on, that the Line was finished the next Morning, by Break of Day, notwithstanding the continual Fire of the Besieged, to hinder their Progress. Wherefore, finding the Besiegers now ready to storm the cover'd Way, they thought fit to beat a Parley, and to surrender the Place into the Hands of the Confederates; who became the more easily Masters of it, because of its Remoteness from the rest of the French Do∣minions; and that the Mareschal de Catinat was obliged to send the greatest part of his Forces to secure the Coasts of Provence, which seemed to be threatned with an Invasion from the Confederate Fleet, under the Command of Admiral Russell. But because the Duke of Savoy valued himself much upon the Reduction of this Place, and gave the States of Holland an Account thereof by his Letter, we shall the more willingly insert the same, because of a Passage or two in it, which did not at all correspond with what was transacted on his part, in Italy, the following Year: High and Mighty Lords, THE Generous and Affectionate Sentiments which Your High and Mightinesses make appear in Our Behalf, and how greatly You lay Our Interests to Heart, engage Vs indispensibly to Impart, without Delay, to Your Knowledge, the Surrender of Casall. We shall not trouble Your High and Mightinesses with an exact Account of what passed in this Enterprize, nor with the particulars of the Capitulation; having ordered the Count, and President de la Tour, to give you a moe punctual Information: Be pleased then, that I may refer You to his more particular Re∣lation; Earnestly beseeching You to grant Me the Continuation of Your Friendship; and assuring You, that You may certainly rely upon Ours, which will always incline Vs to wish You an Ac∣cumulation of all manner of Prosperity; and to testifie upon all Occasions, that We are, more than any other, From the Camp before Casall, July 13. 1695. High and Mightinesses, &c. Signed, V. AMADEVS.
There being nothing else of Moment transacted on the side of Italy this Season, we shall now pass over a wide Coun∣try, and see what is doing between the Germans and the Turks. We should have told you in the preceding Year, that Guila was given up into the Hands of the Imperialists, to∣wards the close of it: And if the Imperial Court valued them∣selves upon it, they had no reason to do so upon account the change of Government that hapned in the Ottoman Em∣pire, by the Death of Sultan Ackmet, who departed this life 27th of January at Adrianople;Sultan Ack∣met's Death. For his Nephew Mu∣stapha, Son to Mahomet IV. that had been deposed (as we have already more particularly related) was advanced to the Throne, and proved to be a more Active Prince, than had swayed that Scepter for many years: And this he quickly manifested by the several Regulations he made first at home, and among other things, in forbidding the Eunuchs and La∣dies of the Seraglio (who in time past had had a main Share in the Administration) to intermeddle with State Affairs and in suppressing in the Bud, a tumultuary design of the Janizaries, which they intended to have begun by a demand of the Donative, that had been frequently bestowed upon them, upon new Advancements, and then by going actually into the Field to Head his Armies himself. This the Imperial Court was not long ignorant of, and therefore to obviate this Turkish Heat, of a young Prince, in the flower of his Years, and Heading a formidable Army, they turned their Thoughts upon the Elector of Saxony, as a very fit Person to oppose against him, both in respect to his Age and Power; and to that purpose, the Emperor concluded a Treaty with his Highness, whereby he was impowered to have the sole Command of his Army in Hungary, in the same manner as Elector of Bavaria had it before him, but that the Elector should bring 8000 Men of his Troops into the Field, to oppose this young Infidel, who about the beginning of July arrived with his whole Power at Belgrade; where he had not been long, but he began to think of Action. To attack the main Army now under the Elector of Saxony, encamped near Peter Waradin, he did not think fit to attempt; but at last he chose rather to play at a small Game, than to stand out: Knowing well, that a little Action performed by him, would make a mighty Noise among his Subjects, whose forme Princes never dared almost to venture their Heads out of their Seraglio's; and therefore he resolved to take Lipp which the Garrison that was in it defended stoutly and most bravely, considering their weak Circumstances, and after all lost it with the loss of all their Lives, the Place being take by Storm: But besides the Cannon, Ammunition, and Par∣ticularly, the great Magazine they found therein (which
they carried to Temeswaer) it proved to be of no great ad∣vantage to the Ottomans, for they blew up the Fort and ruin∣ed the Town, not finding themselves in a Condition to keep what they had won.Sultan Mu∣stapha takes Lippa and Titull. The same fate also attended the For∣tress of Titull, which being not tenable, was surrendred un∣to them upon Articles, though they ungenerously broke them by sending the Commander, and Palfi's Battalion to Belgrade, Prisoners; and what was more Barbarous of the Basha at the same time, he caused the Head of the Commander of the Rasciens, an Officer of Worth, that had signalized himself, by several Encounters, to be cut off before the Governor of Titull's Face. In the mean time the Imperial Army, finding the Turks chief Aim was against Transilvania, divided it self, and all the Infantry marched to Peter Waradin, under the Command of the Count de Staremburg, to observe the Motions of the Turks on that side; while the Elector of Saxony advanced with the main Body of Horse, to reinforce General Veterani, and secure Transilvania. But for all the haste he could make, a Detachment of about 15000 Spahi's with Cannon, which the Sultan (who was now about Temeswaer) had sent to join another of the like Force, and to fall upon Veterani, who had but 8000 Men with him, and was advanced as far as Lugos, in Order to facilitate his Conjunction with the Elector, reached the said Place before him, the Success whereof take in the following Letter, bearing Date from Vienna, Octob. 1st, this Year. CAptain Grismar is arriv'd in this City from Transilvania,A Letter concerning the Defeat of General Veteran. with the News, That General Veterani advanced as far as Lugos, with a Body of about 8000 Men, to facilitate his join∣ing with the Elector of Saxony, which was to have been upon the 24th of September. But before that, he was Attacked in a very advantageous Post, where he lay Encamp'd, upon the 21st of the same Month, by an Army of the Turks, consisting of be∣tween 30 and 40000 Men. The Action began by break of Day, with some Skirmishes: After which, the main Body of the Turks came thundering in upon our Men, who maintain'd their Ground with extraordinary Courage from Eleven a Clock in the Forenoon, till Four a Clock in the Afternoon. General Veterani, who shew∣ed himself every where, and enliven'd his Men by his Example, made a great Slaughter of the Enemy, but having received two Wounds in the Head with a Scimeter, and two Musket-shot in his Body, he remained in the Medley; and Night coming on, fa∣vour'd the Retreat of the rest of the Men towards Caransebes, under the Command of General Truchses, who afterwards mar∣ched to possess himself of the Iron Gate, and those other Passes
that defend the Inlets into Transilvania. We know not as yet whether General Veterani be among the Slain, or taken Pri∣soner. Some Letters say, That he was carry'd to Temeswaer, together with the Prince of Litchtenstein, Major General Pace, General Stein, and several other stout Officers and Soldiers, the loss of whom, which is said to amount to 3000 Men, cost the In∣fidels very dear: For we are assur'd, that they lost in this Conflict above 6000 Men, several Basha's, and great Officers. There were various Reports, besides what this Letter mentions concerning that brave Man, General Veteran's Death; but the truest of all was, that when he found all was lost, and himself so desperately wounded, 500 Horse carried him into a little Morass, and put him into a Calash, with a design to have carried him into Carensebes. But being en∣velop'd by some Thousands of the Turks, they quitted the General, and cut their way through the midst of the Ene∣my, in order to save themselves; and so left him to be seiz∣ed by the Turks, who presently cut off his Head, and car∣ried it to the Grand Visier, who caused his Body to be dili∣gently sought for, and took great care to have both Buried together. But what Noise soever this Victory, as they cal∣led it, made in the Turkish Empire, the Grand Seignior, perhaps measuring the Strength and Bravery of the main Army of the Christians, by the great Resistance this hand∣ful of Men had made, and which cost him so very dear, or else being not willing to tempt his Fortune any further in this his Virgin Campaign; He thought of nothing now, but retiring home, to make Preparations for another Season, and the Germans shewed themselves as forward to do the like as himself; and in this disposition, we shall at present leave them, and see whether the Mahometans had as much reason to rejoyce at the Success of their Arms against the Venetian Republick. We left the Venetians last Year exulting for Joy,Scio quited by the Vene∣tians. because of their Conquest of the Island of Scio, but they had in the main, no great reason for it: For the Turks being intent, ever since the loss of the Place, to recover it again, sailed early in the Spring to Attack it, destroyed 3 out of 5 of the Republick Ships, who fell in among them without the rest of the Fleets being able to double the Rocks of Spalmadori, in order to come to a General Engagement and to their As∣sistance, and when they had so done, returned for the pre∣sent to Phocis, to compleat their Preparations; while Gene∣ral Zeno coming into the Road of Scio, ordered an Estimate to be taken of the Provision left in the Fortress, and in the Fleet, and finding, as he gave an Account, it could not last above 14 days, he entirely abandoned the Island, and re∣turned
with the whole Fleet to Napoli di Romania, giving the Turks an Opportunity to possess that without striking a stroak, which they valued so much, and made such great Preparations to re-take, and himself to be censured by all that ever heard of the Action, as well as to be succeeded in his Command by that noble Venetian Alexander Molino. But how pleasing soever this Repossession of Scio was to the Turks, the News they received from the Morea, was not near so well-come, on which they had formed a considerable Design. It's true, Ibrahim Serasquier of Negropont entred in∣to that Country with an Army of about 20000 Men, advan∣ced to Argos, and entrenched himself within two Miles of it, while a Detachment was sent to make an Assault upon the Castle of the same Name, to the end that he being Master thereof, might penetrate farther into the Country: But Ge∣neral Steinau who lay with a Body of Men not far off, not only vigorously repulsed them, but pursued them very near to their own Camp; while General Molino, who had for some time, lain in the Gulph of Eugenea, having Informa∣tion of this Incursion of the Enemy, returned forthwith to Napoli di Romania with the whole Fleet, and landed not only what Men he had on Board his Ships, but those of a Con∣voy newly arrived from Venice, and having joined the Army under General Steinau, upon the 20th of June, he marched betimes in the Morning directly towards the Enemy,The Battle of Mags. at the Head of 10000 Foot, and about 2000 Horse, and posted him∣self within Cannon-shot of the Infidels Camp. They plaid upon one another till 5 in the Evening, when the Turks issu∣ed out of their Entrenchments, and boldly advanced to At∣tack the Christians, with a more than ordinary Fury, and with hideous Crys according to their usual manner. They had at the beginning some little Advantage over the Christi∣stians Left Wing; But they being soon rallied and rein∣forced, the Turks were several times beaten back, and after a Fight that lasted for 3 Hours, forced to yield the Field of Battle to the Victorious Christians, with the loss of about 3000 Men slain upon the Spot, besides Prisoners, and to retire into their Retrenchments, which they quitted next Night, and retreated silently out of the Morea: But with so much haste, that they left in their Camp behind, 14 Pieces of Cannon, 2 Mortars, a good number of Bombs, great store of Ammunition and Provision, 2 Standards, several Tents, 700 Head of Oxen, and 300 Cammels and Horses, as a Boo∣ty to the Conquerors, whose loss amounted to about 500 Men, and who by this brave Action prevented the Ravaging of the whole Morea, and the Besieging of Napoli di Romania by Land, while the Turkish Fleet blocked it up by Sea, as the Infidels had concerted their Design. But I do not find
the Venetians made any Improvement of this Victory, tho' it hapned timely enough in the Summer. However, it was exceeding brave of them, and the Germans too, in compari∣son of the Poles, which Army (I think) hardly ever turned out of their Quarters this Season, and the chief business of whose King was to endeavour, though in vain, to mediate a reconciliation between the Bishop of Vilna, and the Gene∣ral of Lithuania, whom the former excommunicated for quar∣tering of some Troops within his Jurisdiction. A hard Case upon a Prince to have his measures broken in relation to the Campaign, as himself told the Deputies of the said Bishop, thro' the feuds of a couple of humorous Subjects. But thus it is to hold a precarious Crown; And as for the Muscovites, all that we heard of them this Summer, was their march against the Tartars, but nothing of Action, save the block∣ing up of Asoph, of which you will hear more next Year. It remains now, that we return homewards, and briefly see what had been doing before the Conclusion of the Year; His Majesty after so glorious a Campaign; as before men∣tioned, hasted for England, and being arrived to the gladning of the Hearts of all his honest Subjects, on the 11th of Oct. at his Palace at Kensington; He called a Council that very Night, and a Proclamation was ordered to be issued fourth for the Dissolving of the then Parliament, and calling a new one to meet upon Nov. 22d following.Parliament Dissolv'd and another call'd. Soon after this, the Great Duke of Tuscany's Envoy, whose Master was grown mighty good Natur'd since our Fleet went into the Streights, had his Audience of His Majesty to Congratulate his Happy Accession to the Throne, but this was somewhat like to that of the Ilienses which we Read of in Suetonius, who coming a Day after the Fair to Condole with the Emperor Tiberius, for the Death of his Son Drusus, the other made them Answer: And I also Condole with you the Death of your great Countryman Hector. This being over, His Majesty went a short Progress, and the day of the Parliaments sitting being come, he spake to them to this Effect. My Lords and Gentlemen, IT is with great Satisfaction that I meet you here this Day,The King's Speech. be∣ing assured of a good Disposition in my Parliament, when I have had such full Proofs of the Affection of My People, by their Behaviour during My Absence, and at My Return. I was engaged in the present War by the Advice of My first Parliament; who thought it necessary for the Defence of Our Re∣ligion, and for the Preservation of the Liberties of Europe. The last Parliament, with great Chearfulness, did assist Me to carry on; and I cannot doubt, but that your Concern for the Common Safety will oblige you to be unanimously zealous in the Prosecutio
of it. And I am glad, That the Advantages which We have had this Year, give Vs a Reasonable Ground of hoping for farther Suc∣cess hereafter. Vpon this Occasion, I cannot but take Notice of the Courage and Bravery the English Troops have shewn this last Summer; which, I may say, has answered their highest Character in any Age. And it will not be denied, That without the Concurrence of the Valour and Power of England, it were impossible to put a Stop to the Am∣bition and Greatness of France. Gentlemen of the House of Commons, I think it my great Misfortune, That from the Beginning of My Reign, I have been forced to Ask so many, and such large Aids of My People: And yet, I am confident you will agree with Me in Opinion, That there will be, at least, as great Supplies requisite for Carrying on the War by Sea and Land this Year, as were Grant∣ed in the last Session; and the rather, because Our Enemies are Augmenting their Troops; and the Necessity of Increasing Our Shipping does plainly appear. The Funds which have been given, have proved very defi∣cient. The Condition of the Civil List is such, that it will not be possible for Me to subsist, unless that Matter be taken into your Care. And Compassion obliges Me to mention the miserable Circum∣stances of the French Protestants, who suffer for their Religion. And therefore, Gentlemen, I most earnestly recommend to you, to prouide a Supply suitable to these several Occasions. I must likewise take notice of a great Difficulty We lie under at this time, by reason of the ill State of the Coin; the Redress of which, may perhaps prove a further Charge to the Nation: But this is a Matter of so general Concern, and so great Importance, that I have thought fit to leave it entirely to the Consideration of My Parliament. I did recommend to the last Parliament, the Forming some good Bill for the Encouragement and Increase of Seamen. I hope you will not let this Session pass, without doing something in it: And that you will consider of such Laws as may be proper for the Advancement of Trade; and that you will have a particular Re∣gard to that of the East-India's, lest it should be lost to the Na∣tion. And while the War makes it necessary to have an Army abroad, I could wish some Way might be thought of to Raise the necessary Recruits, without giving Occasion of Complaint. My Desire to meet My People in a New Parliament, has made the Opening of this Session very late; which, I hope, you will have such Regard to, as to make all possible Dispatch of the great Business before you: And also, that you will call to mind, that by the long Continuance of the last Session, We did not only lose Advantages
which We might have had at the Beginning of the Campaign, but gave the Enemy such an Opportunity, as might have proved very fatal to us. And I am the more concerned to press this, because of the great Preparations which the French make to be early in the Field this Year. My Lords and Gentlemen, I have had such Experience of your good Affections; and I have such an entire Satisfaction in the Choice which My People have made of you, Gentlemen of the House of Commons, that I promise My Self an happy Conclusion of this Session, unless you suffer your selves to be mis-led into Heats and Divisions: Which being the only Hope Our Enemies have now left, I make no Doubt but you will entirely disappoint them, by your Prudence, and Love to your Country. We will leave the Parliament to deliberate upon the migh∣ty Affairs contained in this Speech, as we do Admiral Sir George Rook to go into the Streights in the room of Admiral Russel now come home with our great Ships; and observe, according to our Custom in the Conclusion of the Year, what has fallen out that was particularly remarkable in the Course of it, that could not well be introduced into the Body of the Story, and we find only this, that Anselm Francis Frederick de Angelheim,The death of the E∣lector of Mentz. Bishop of Mentz, departed this Life on the 30th of March, being extreamly aged, after having held that Bi∣shoprick about 16 Years, and was succeeded in the Bishoprick and Electorate by Lothair Francis de Schonborn his Coad jutor, and Bishop of Bemberg. Now we begin with another Year, and without the least Recapitulation of what preceded, we come to take notice, That though our Arms had triumphed abroad in the manner already related, yet never was a Nation under such unhap∣py Circumstances as England at this time, where Guineas were at an exorbitant Price, and our Silver Coin, through the Wickedness of Villanous Men, reduced to such a state, that nothing but the Wisdom of such a Parliament as then sate, and of him that was at the Head of them, could possi∣bly have gone through with the Amendment of it. But though the matter was managed with admirable Prudence and Ce∣lerity,An Act to remedy the ill state of the COin. so as that an Act was ready, and Signed early in Jan. for the remedying the ill State of our Coin: Yet it put such a general Stop to Trade, and gave such an occasion of Un∣easiness to all in general, and such an opportunity for the Malecontents to be practising their Villanies against the Go∣vernment, that I dare avow, it would have been endured in no other Reign, save that of our good and heroick King
nor so well then neither, save something that happened in consequence of it, which gave an opportunity to secure all that were suspected to be troublesome, and which turned the worst of Mischiefs to the best Effects, according to the Dis∣position of Divine Providence, that had always appeared very remarkable in the preservation of that Sacred Life, whom we shall never sufficiently value. But to give a little Sceach of what was preludious to the Discovery of that dam∣nable Design against His Majesty's Person, we are to under∣stand, that the French,The Assassi∣nation disco∣verd. finding themselves considerably up∣on the losing Hand last Campagne, not only made divers new Levies this Winter; but divers Troops filed off daily towards the Sea-Coast, which gave great Umbrage to the Confederates, and especially to Holland, as fearing they might be designed to infest the Coasts of Zealand and Flanders. But the Design was quickly unravel'd; for many Days in Februa∣ry had not been gone, but that it was a publick Discourse in France, That the Intent was to re-establish the late King upon the Throne; and that the Design was so far concerted, that nothing more remained but the Winds and the Waves to do their part: In order to this, the late King, on the 18th of February, took Post for Calais; and, immediately upon his Arrival, the Troops, Artillery, and Stores were ordered to be put on Board with the utmost Diligence, while News was impatiently expected from England to set Sail: And so Cock-sure were they in France of the Success of the Enter∣prize, that the Duke of Orleans, in consideration of his near Alliance with the Duke of Savoy, and with an assured Pro∣spect of the Overthrow of most of the Confederates, sollici∣ted that Prince in a very pressing manner, to make his Peace betimes. But if they were so mightily alarmed before on the other side of the Water at these Preparations, they were much more now, when they heard of the late King's Arrival at Calais; which made the Duke of Wirtemberg immediately to dispatch one of his Aids de Camp for England, to give his Majesty notice of all this. The Prince de Vaudemont, who was then at Brussels with the Elector of Bavaria, both dispatched Expresses also to the King by way of Holland upon the same account. But the Duke of Wirtemberg's Messenger going di∣rectly by the way of Newport, with great Difficulty, in escap∣ing the Enemy, got to Court first, which was on the 22d of Feb. and acquainted his Majesty, that the Duke had stopped all the Ships in the Harbor and Canal of Ostend, as well as that of Bruges, in order to transport the Forces over for his Service. And 'twas further said, he should send word, That in case he did not hear quickly from his Majesty, he would run the hazard of bringing them over. The States of Hol∣land made the like Preparations at Sas van Ghent. But not∣withstanding
all the Expedition used by the Duke of Wirtem∣berg's Aid de Camp, the King had received before some cer∣tain Intimations not only of the Invasion, but also of the Con∣spiracy against his Person. But because such desperate Designs as these are, cannot be thought to be concerted in a Day, it will be necessary to look a little back, and search into the very beginning of it, as far as could be discovered from such Hellish Darkness. It was as early as the latter end of 1694. that the Embrio of the Villany was contrived; and because some might be brought to engage in such an Assassination, who otherwise scrupled it, unless they had a Commisssion from the late King for that purpose, it was agreed, that one Mr. Waugh should go visit his Friends, the Jacobites, in England, and to give those of them he most confided in an Account, that their Friends in France thought the killing of King William the most effectual means to restore their old Master Jemmy; And, in order to assure them of his Concurrence in the Fact, they should have a Commission from him to command the doing it, and an Order to all his general Officers then in England, to be aiding and assisting in it. To corroborate this Assurance Major Crosby came at the same time over, and affirmed he saw the Commission Signed, and under Seal, in France; that it was sent away before him; and if it was not already come, he was certain it was upon the Road. But however it came about, and that the Project was to cut the King off before he went to Holland, blessed be God, it took not effect: Yet that it was really intended, is manifest from the Lady Mary Fenwick's Petition, praying a Reprieve for Sir John her Hus∣band, delivered afterwards to the House of Lords. But though His Majesty got safe, and escaped the intended Fatal Stroak, the restless Spirits of those wicked Men, some whereof were born to be hanged, would not let them give over their Vil∣lany; and therefore they had several Meetings about it, and one particularly, where were my Lord Aylsbury, my Lord Montgomery, Sir John Friend, Sir William Perkins, Sir John Fenwick, Mr. Charnock, Mr. Cook, Captain Porter, and Mr. Goodman, who came in after Dinner. There they consulted of the best way to restore the late K. James; and all agreed to send a Messenger over to the late King to desire him to procure of the French King 10000 Men, viz. 1000 Horse, 1000 Dragoons, and 8000 Foot. Mr. Charnock was the Per∣son to manage this Affair, who said, he would not go on a foolish Errand, and therefore would know what the Com∣pany would do, if Foreign Forces could be procured; where∣upon they all unanimously promised, if the late King would come over with such a number of Men as was desired, they would meet him at the head of 2000 Horse, where-ever he
would appoint. At the latter end of June, 1695. or the be∣ginning of July, they had another meeting, when after ma∣ny publick Discourses and private Whisperings, Mr. Char∣nock desiring the Company to acquaint him whether they continued their former Resolutions; they assured him, they did, and would meet him with the number of Men, promised at the former Meeting. Upon which, Mr. Charnock told them; he would begin the Journey in a few Days. The In∣vasion being thus promoted, by dispatching Mr. Charnock into France; that the Assassination might not lag behind it, some of the Assassins called to mind, that nothing would be attempted in that kind, till the Commission, which Crosby said was upon the Road, was come to their Hands. Cap∣tain Porter and Mr. Goodman communicated the Project to Sir George Barclay, who was then in England, and upon his De∣parture for France; telling him, what Difficulties they la∣boured under for want of it; and that a longer Delay of the Commission would extreamly embarrass the Affair. Sir George not only approved, but commended the Design; and that such an hopeful Project might not miscarry, he promised to use all his Interest, when he came to St. Germain's, that such a Commission should no longer be wanting. This En∣couragement from so considerable a Favourite as Sir George Barclay, (whose Bigottry to the Romish Perswasion, and the late King's Interest, would prompt them to any thing in fa∣vour of him,) employed all their Heads, and opened all their Purses, to contribute the last Assistance for the Accomplish∣ment of the Assassination. The Beginning of Aug. 1695. brings Mr. Charnock again to London, with the unwelcome News, That the French King was not in a Condition to spare the Jacobites such a Number of Men as they desired: Which being imparted to the Chief of that Unruly and Blood∣thirsty Faction, the two Branches of the Conspiracy to over∣throw the established Government, were both laid aside, till the approaching Winter should give them another Re∣surrection. But in Nov. 1695, Sir George Barclay with several Officers and Soldiers, and 800 l. in Mony, came into England, and and brought with him a Commission from King James, (all written with his own Hand,) to seize King William; which Sir William Perkins confessed to a Committee of Parliament, he saw: But neither Sir George Barclay, nor the Commission, being yet in the Hands of the Government, and the Jacobites ashamed to set up their late King, and themselves, under the infamous Title of Murtherers, they minced the Matter in∣to more relishable Terms; and that it was only To levy War upon the Prince of Orange, and all his Adherents. Others said, it was to attack the Prince of Orange, in his Winter-Quarters.
All which are meer Tricks and Evasions, invented by the Party, to disguise the Horrour of the Action; for the very Gloss which they themselves put upon it, sets it in its true Light, for all the Party knew the meaning of Attacking of the Prince of Orange, as appears by Monsieur de la Rue's Oath; who deposeth, That when the Musquettoon was lent by Mr. Porter, to Mr. Pendergrass, which would carry six or eight Bullets, Mr. King desired him, when he shot at His Majesty, not to be afraid of breaking the Glasses. Sir George Barclay, after his Arrival at London, lodged in Covent-Garden, and kept himself very private, till he could speak with Sir William Perkins, Captain Vaughan, and Mr. Charnock; and that the 22 Men who were sent by King James, out of France, and appointed to obey his Orders, were come to London also▪ And now they endeavoured to strengthen their Party, by the Addition of more Friends; as Mr. de la Rue, Mr. Pendergrass, Mr. Rookwood, Major Lowick, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Bertram, Chambers, Durant, Cramburne, Kendrick, Grimes, Waugh and Goodman, some of which were engaged in the designed As∣sassination the Year before, and were now again confirmed in it. As for Captain Porter, (who has now so honourably and honestly attoned for his former Offences,) they were sure of him already: But to others, in whom they had no more than ordinary Confidence, they discoursed of the Assassination at a distance; and if they found in them any Reluctancy or Indisposition to the Assassination, they turned them over to the Invasion-Plot, and desired them to be ready to meet their old Master, at his Landing: But to those whom Wicked∣ness had made fit for any Impression, they imparted their Villany in Words at length; and so secured the whole Par∣ty, either to be Rebels, or Murtherers. Those that came from France, knew not what Affair they were sent upon, till they arrived at London, but were kept in a blind Obedience to Sir George Barclay's Orders; as appears by the Depositi∣ons of Mr. George Horn; who saith, That he, this Depo∣nent, was an Ensign of Foot under the late King James, in Scotland; and has since served in the Second Troop of Guards, in France: And about the 14th of Jan. 1695, King James sent for this Deponent, and Michael Hore, his Comrade; and in the Queen's Bed-Chamber told him, That he had now an Opportunity of doing something for him, as a Re∣ward of his faithful Services: That he would send him into England, where he should be provided for; and that he should follow Sir George Barclay's Orders; and in so doing, he should take care of him: That he had ordered them Mony for their Journey, which they should receive from Mr. Caryll, the late Queen's Secretary. And he farther told this Deponent, That he should find Sir George Barclay every
Monday and Thursday, between Six and Seven at Night, in Covent-Garden Square; whom they should know by a white Handkerchief hanging out of his Pocket. He also told this Deponent, That when he came to England, he must go by the Name of Jenkins; and his Comrade Hore, by the Name of Guiney. And farther this Deponent saith, That Colonel Parker was present, and heard all that the late King said; and went with this Informant, and his Comrade, to Mr. Ca∣ryll, and told him, that the King had ordered each of them Ten Lovis de' Ors, which would be sufficient to carry them into England: And if they should be Wind-bound, he had written to the President Toffe, at Calais, to furnish them with what they should have Occasion for. The rest of the Assassins were Men of desperate Fortunes, Hangers-on at the Court of St. Germains, or Soldiers taken out of several Re∣giments, whose Character render'd them fit for such an in∣humane Enterprize. All the Assassins being come to London, that were expect∣ed from France, and their Number compleated, by the Ad∣dition of others that were in England, the Execrable Design was imparted to all the Desperadoes; some of which were startled, and amazed with Horrour, at the first Relation of it: But all the Scruples that Conscience could raise, were soon extinguished by the Authority of the late King James's Commission, and their plentiful Prospects of Wealth and Ho∣nour, that would attend the Action: And therefore, All con∣sented to forfeit their Honours, and hazard their Lives in it. Now several Ways are proposed by the Conspirators, to exe∣cute their long-designed Attempt against His Majesty's Per∣son: Some proposed Seizing His Majesty, and carrying him alive into France; and to that purpose it was pretended, that a Castle on the Sea-side was to be secured, to detain the King, till a Ship was ready to transport him thither. But the Wiser, and more wicked among them, who understood what was meant by Seizing the King's Person, laughed at this, as a meer Chimera. Others proposed to kill His Majesty at Ken∣sington, by attacking his Guards, and forcing his Palace, in the dead time of the Night: But this, upon debating of it, was also thought wholly impracticable. Some were for mur∣thering the King as he came on Saturday to St. James's Chap∣pel: And for this purpose, 40 Men, well armed, were to assault His Majesty's Guards, which commonly do not exceed 25; while 6 Men on foot should shut Hyde-Park Gates, and the rest assassinate His Majesty. It was agreed also to kill the Coach-Horses as they were entring into the Park, that the Passage being stopped, the Guards might not be able to come up till they had done their Work. Another Proposal was, to murther the King as he returned from Hunting, in
a narrow Lane, by a Wood-side, leading to the Thames, on the other side of the Water, about 150 Paces long, wherein there is a Gate, which when it is shut, hinders Coaches or Horses from passing that way. One of the Assassins was sent to view the Ground, and another to view the Lane before-mentioned: But Sir George Barclay, who was to command this infamous Party, did not approve of that Lane; and the Difficulty that arose in the Debate, caused the Project to be rejected. At last they fixed upon a Place betwixt Brentford and Turnham-Green, in a Bottom, where the Ground is Moor∣ish: There is a Bridge, where divers Roads meet, and crss oen another. On the North side there is a Road that goes round Brentford; and on the South, a Lane that leads to the River; so that one may come thither by four several Ways. After you have passed the Bridge, the Road grows narrow; having on one side a Foot-Path, and on the other a tall and thick Hedge. And this Place was pitched upon for the Exe∣cution of their barbarous Villany: And truly, if Heaven had not discovered their Treasons, (all Circumstances considered, a more unlucky Place and Time could not have been found out; for His Majesty very often returned late from Hunt∣ing, and usually crossed the Water at Queen's-Ferry, by Brent∣ford, with no greater Attendance than 5 or 6 of his Guards: It was also His Majesty's Custom to enter the Ferry-Boat without coming out of his Coach; and as soon as he landed on this side the Water, the Coach drove on, without expect∣ing the rest of the Guards, who could not cross the Thames till the Boat returned to Surrey-side, to bring them over; and so the King must inevitably have fallen into the Hands of his Murtherers, before the rest of the Guards could have come up to his Assistance. Neither was the Time and Place more cunningly and Devilishly contrived, than their Men were disposed of; for having secured several Places at Brentford, Turnham-Green, and in scattered Houses thereabouts, to se up their Horses till the King should return from Hunting; One of the Conspirators was ordered to wait at Queen's-Per∣ry till the King's Guards appeared in sight, on Surrey-side of the Water, and then to give speedy Notice to the rest, to be ready at their respective Posts while the King was crossing the Thames. For this wicked End, they were divided into three Parties, which was to make their Approaches by three several Ways; one of which was to come from Turnham-Gree▪ another from the Lane that leads to the Thames, and the Third from the Road that goes round Brentford. One these Parties were to attack the Guards in the Front, and another in the Rear, whilst 10 or 12 Men of the bloodie sort were to assassinate His Majesty in his Coach, and put Perod to that Sacred Life, whose Safety and Well-being
a Defence to the Liberties of Europe, as well as the particu∣lar Joy, Delight, and Safety of England. When their exe∣crable Design was accomplished, the Conspirators resolved to keep in a Body till they came beyond Hammersmith, and then to separate, and by several Roads to hasten to London, and from thence to the Sea-side; where the sudden Land∣ing of the French might secure them from the Rage of the Multitude, and the Hand of Justice. Thus was the Assassi∣nation to make way for a French Invasion; and the Invasion to shelter the Murtherers of our King and Country. Horses were now the only Necessaries wanting; and Sir George Bar∣clay complaining that the 800 l. which he brought over was already so far exhausted, that he could not out of the Re∣mainder provide so great a Number as 40, they all agreed that he should find but half; and the other 20 should be supplied by Sir William Perkins, Mr. Porter, and Mr. Char∣nock. All things being thus agreed on, the Duke of Berwick who was sent into England to countenance the Action, posted for France to give his supposed Father an account of it, who shewed himself mightily pleased with it; and indeed, the Villany was now in a manner brought to a Crisis. For, the Fifteenth Day of February, was the Day appointed to Mur∣der the King, if kind Heaven had not prevented it, and now the Leaders having quartered the Assassines, in several parts of the Town, to prevent suspition, they all lay close and still, expecting notice from their Orderly Men of the King's be∣ing gone to Richmond. But so it pleased God Almighty, that His Majesty, did not go Abroad that Day: This disappoint∣ment and fears of a Discovery, made Plouden, Kendrick, and Sherborn decline the Action, and withdraw themselves; but Sir George Barclay, Sir William Perkins, Cap. Porter, and Mr. Goodman, concluding the Design was not Discovered, because they were not taken up by the Government; had another Meeting, Feb. the 19th and there resolved to Execute their Bloody Project, on Saturday the 22d. of February. The Fore∣noon of that Day was spent in a tedious expectation of News, that the King was gone Abroad, when one of their Order∣ly Men, (which they lodged at Kensington, to give them No∣tice when the King went out) tells them that the Guards were all come back in a Foam, and that there was a mut∣tering among the People, that a Damnable Plot was Disco∣vered, and this unexpected News dispersed all the Conspi∣rators, and drove them to shift for themselves, by a speedy Flight: Nor, were their apprehensions of a Discovery ground∣less, for the Plot and the Progress that was made in it, from time to time, had been Discovered by Richard Fisher, to the Right Honourable the Earl of Portland, a considerable time
before any other Person Discovered it, and as things ripen'd for Action, his Lordship was a cquainted with the Particulars. On the 10th of February, he acquainted that Noble Lord, how far it was advanced, and promised to wait upon his Lordship with a further Account in a few Days, according∣ly he did: On February the 13th he gave his Lordship a full Account of the Design it self, and the Time, Place, and Manner, of its Execution; but refusing to give to his Lord∣ship the Names of the Conspirators, made his Discovery sus∣pected, till the Addition of other Witnesses gave an unque∣stionable Authority to the Truth of it. Mr. Pendergrass who was wholly ignorant of this Barbarous Design, till he was sent for to London, and there acquainted with it, being struck with Horror and Astonishment at the first Proposal of it, even then took a Resolution to preserve His Majesty's Life, and Discover the Conspiracy: Accordingly on February 14th he waited on the Earl of Portland at his Lordship's Lodgings at White-Hall, and being admitted to Privacy with his Lord∣ship, though wholly a Stranger, without further Address, ac∣costs his Lordship with this surprizing Request: Pray, My Lord, perswade the King to stay at home to Morrow, for if he goes abroad to Hunt, he will be Murdered; to this, he subjoined a Relation of the whole Plot, as it had been Communicated unto him by the Confederated Assassines, which he said, he would have told the King himself, but that he durst not go to Kensington, for fear of the two Orderly Men, which were kept as Spies there, to give Intelligence of what occurred in that Court. He was introduced that Night to the King, though very late; and there in his whole Deportment, shew'd himself to be a Man of Honour; neither was Mr. de la Rue short of Mr. Pendergras, in making a discovery of the in∣tended Assassination, though his Friend Brigadeer Lewson, who he designed should acquaint the King with it, being then out of Town, makes his Information appear somewhat latter then the former; For as he is a Man of too much Ho∣nour to be engaged in a Murder, so his concern to discover it, was from the beginning, though he did not declare it, till his Discovery might be serviceable to His Majesty; and then as soon as he had opportunity to impart the Secret, he did it, and Brigadier Lewson much about the same time, ac∣quainted the King, that Mr. de la Rue informed him of a De∣sign carrying on to Assassinate His Majesty, and had given him a particular Account, by what methods it was design'd to be accomplished, and proposed a way, if the King thought , how all the Conspirators might be taken in Arms, when they thought to attempt it: But that which seems strange in all these Discoverers, though they punctually agreed, and in the Circumstances, yet they all peremptorily refused to name
the Conspirators, which might have been of fatal conse∣quence, if the Earl of Portland had not found out the happy expedient to prevent it, by perswading His Majesty to give himself the trouble to examine Mr. Pendergrass, and Mr. de la Rue in his Closet: His Majesty being overcome by the Reasons alledged, by that Noble Peer, condescended to his Request, and examined them both seperately. At Mr. Pen∣dergrass's Examination, was present the Earl of Portland, and the Lord Cuts, and Mr. de la Rue's Examination was heard by the same Noble Earl, and Brigadier Lewson: After the Examination, His Majesty shewed himself extreamly well sa∣tisfied in the Truth of their Discoveries, and in a very oblig∣ing manner, expressed his Resentments to, of their great Care and Zeal they shewed for the preservation of his Life, and the safety of the Kingdom; and at last gave them such unanswerable Reasons, why as Men of Honour, and lovers of their Country, they should compleat their Duty and Kind∣ness, in discovering the Names of the Conspirators, that quite subdued their former Obstinacies, and prevailed upon them to make a full and true Discovery of the Assassins, under the promise of not being made use of as Evidences; But Mr. Pen∣dergrass hearing that Mr. Porter, who engaged him in it, had Discovered and Accused him, he thought himself Discharged from any Obligation of Honour in concealing it, and there∣fore afterwards as an Evidence for the King, freely told all he knew at Charnock's Tryal, Pag. 40. The King having now a perfect knowledge of the Conspiracy, and the Names of the Conspirators, His Majesty Issues out his Royal Proclama∣tion, requiring all his Loving Subjects to Apprehend the Con∣spirators, promising 1000 l. reward for every Offender, that should be taken and brought to Justice. And here give me leave to take notice of the extream Fury, Madness, and Bi∣gottry of Mr. Charnock, who meeting with Mr. Bertram acci∣dentally at Lincolns-Inn Back-gate, told him, That Warrants, were out against them (as he heard) and they had as good if he would come to his Lodging, go up to Kensington and do the Work at once, and take off the Spark, and then they should be all at quiet, and have the King peaceably here. What a strange infatuation this ingenious Man was under, is a wonder to all that knew him: Immediately after the Pro∣clamation was out, Mr. George Harris, one of the Persons that was sent out of France, to obey the Orders of Sir George Bar∣clay, and was actually engaged in the Assassination, resigned himself to the Right Honourable Sir William Trumbal, one of His Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, and generously convinced him of the reality of the Assassination, and inva∣sion Plots, though he was not able to declare the particular Circumstance that attended them.
His Majesty being now fully convinced on all hands, both of the Conspiracy and intended Invasion, used no delay in sending for a sufficient number of Troops over, as he gave all necessary Orders to Arm the Fleet; Admiral Russel be∣ing immediately ordered down to Chatham for that purpose, and the Rendesvous appointed in the Downs, where all the Men of War we had in the Sea-ports, were ordered to come and join the Admiral, that with such Dispatch and admi∣rable Celerity, and that in 4 or 5 days time, the Admi∣ral had a Fleet of near 60 Men of War in a Line of Battle, passing by Dover-Castle, from whence he was saluted by the Earl of Rumney with his Guns, and standing over directly for the Coast of Calais and Dunkirk, more to the Terror and Amazement of the Enemy, than the sudden News of their de∣sign was to us: And here again, I cannot but remark the won∣derful Providence of Almighty God; for our outward-bound Merchant-ships, and their Convoys, together with the Squa∣dron design'd for the Streights, had been a long time detain∣ed by contrary Winds, which was very afflicting to our Mer∣chants, and all were sorry Sir George Rook could not for this Reason be so soon reinforced as was necessary, to enable him to defend the Passage of the Streights, against the Naval Pre∣parations that were made at Thoulon. But at the same time, that they appeared so much concerned at the Obstinacy of these Westerly Winds that had now been fix'd for 2 Months; God who sees all things, and even the most secret Machina∣tions and Designs of Men, provided them for our safety, and made that wholsome Physick for us, which we imagined to be Poison. Thy Way, O God! is in the Sea, and thy Paths in the great Waters, and thy foot-steps are not known. In the mean time, while these things were doing upon the Sea, and that the Admiral was bearding of the French up∣on their own Coast, who durst not now as much as peep out of their lurking Holes; The King thought fit to acquaint the two Houses of Parliament with the Conspiracy, and what he had done in order to obviate the same, and this he did in the following Speech: My Lords and Gentlemen, I Came hither this Day upon an extraordinary Occasion,The King's Speech to the Parlia∣ment. which might have proved fatal, if it had not been disappointed by the singular Mercy and Goodness of God; and may now, by the Continuance of the same Providence, and Our own prudent En∣deavours, be so improved, as to become a sufficient Warning to Vs to provide for our Security, against the pernicious Practises and Attempts of Our Enemies. I have received several concur∣ring Informations of a Design to assassinate Me: And that Our Enemies, at the same time, are very forward in their Prepara∣tions
for a sudden Invasion of this Kingdom, I have therefore thought it necessary to lose no Time in acquainting My Parliament with these Things, in which the Safety of the Kingdom, and the Publick Welfare, are so nearly concerned, that I assure My Self, nothing will be omitted on your Part, which may be thought pro∣per for Our present or future Security, I have not been wanting to give the necessary Orders for the Fleet; and I hope We have such a Strength of Ships, and in such a Readiness, as will be suf∣ficient to disappoint the Inventions of Our Enemies. I have also dispatched Orders for bringing home such a Number of Our Troops as may secure us from any Attempt. Some of the Conspirators against My Person are already in Custody; and Care is taken to apprehend as many of the rest as are discovered: And such other Orders are given, as the present Emergency of Affairs do abso∣lutely require at this time, for the Publick Safety. My Lords and Gentlemen, Having now acquainted You with the Danger which hath at∣tended Vs, I cannot doubt of Your Readiness and Zeal to do every thing which you shall judge proper for Our common Safety: And I perswade my self, We must be all sensible now necessary it is in Our present Circumstances, that all possible Dispatch should be gi∣ven to the Business before You. The Parliament were so far from being backward to con∣gratulate His Majesty upon the Deliverance,The Parlia∣ments Po∣cdings there upon. that they lost no time in going upon such Methods as might secure him against the like Villanous Attempts for the future: To which end they did, on the 25th of February, enter into an Association to defend his Person and revenge his Death: And to that of the Commons, the King was pleased to give this Answer, That he took it as a most convincing and accepta∣ble Evidence of their Affection; and as they had freely associated themselves for their common Safety, he did himself heartily enter into the same Association, and would be always ready with them, and the rest of his good Subjects, to venture his Life against all those who should endeavour to subvert the Religion, Laws and Liberties of England. But because they thought this was not sufficient, they proceeded to make other Laws more bind∣ing for the King's and Our Security. And First, That such as should refuse to take the Oaths of Fidelity to His Majesty, should be subject to the Forfeitures and Penalties of Popish Recu∣sants Convict. Secondly, To inflict Penalties on all that by Writ∣ing, or otherwise declared, that King William was not lawful and rightful King of England. Thirdly, To ratifie and con∣firm the Association, to disable any from being capable of any Of∣fice of Profit and Trust, that should not Sign the Association; and that whenever it should please God to afflict these Nations by the
Death of his present Majesty, that the Parliament then in being should not be dissolved thereby, but should continue till the next Heir to the Crown in Succession should dissolve them. Which last was undoubtedly as great a Stroak to our Enemies abroad, as any thing that has fallen out since the Revolution: For it cannot be thought the late King should ever flatter himself to that degree, of being restored by a Free Parliament. But while we were thus securing our selves within, the Parlia∣ment was not unmindful of raising the necessary Supplies to carry on the War abroad; and therefore there were several good Bills prepared for that purpose, and signed, at several times, by his Majesty, before the end of April. While, in the mean time, divers of the Assassins were Tried: And first, Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys, came to their Tryals on the 11th of March; and, upon a full Hearing and Evidence, were all found Guilty of High Trea∣son; and having received Sentence of Death accordingly, they were, upon the 18th of the said Month, executed at Tyburn: But before they were turned off, each of them de∣livered a Paper to the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, wherein every one of them respectively confess'd himself Guilty of the Crime he was accused of. But for the fuller Satisfaction of the Reader, and in pursuance to the Design of this Treatise, we'll give you their Papers delivered by them to the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, at the Place of Exe∣cution, March the 18th. Mr. CHARNOCKE's Paper. THAT I might avoid Distractions, and be Composed as much as possible at the time of my Execution, I thought it much more proper to Communicate This to the Sheriffs, than to give my self the Uneasiness of speaking, leaving it to them to publish (if they think convenient) for the Satisfaction of the World; and in what I have to say, I have taken as much care as I could to be short, that I might not lose time in my greatest Concern. As concerning an Invasion intended by King James upon England, and that there was certain Intelligence of it from Abroad, I presume every Body was satisfied; and to the facilitating of which, I own that my Self and some Others did agree upon the Undertaking, To Attack the Prince of Orange and his Guards, for which I am now to Suffer; but I think my Self obliged by all the Tyes imaginable, both of Conscience and Honour, to declare, That, as for any Order or Commission of King James's for Assassinating the Prince of Orange, I neither saw nor heard of any; but have had
frequent Assurances of his having rejected such Proposals when they have been offer'd. I confess I did hear that there was a Commission arrived for Levying of War, and which was natural to believe, if the King was in such a readiness to come over as was reported; but if there was any such Authority as that, I declare I ne∣ver saw it. As to what regards the Body of the Roman Catholicks, I must do them the Justice, and which I dare to be positive in, That they had no manner of Knowledge of this Design, nor do I believe it was Communicated to any other Party of such as are reputed the King's Friends, but carried on meerly by a small Number, without the Advice, Consent or Privity of any Parties whatsoever. I ask forgiveness of all the World for what Offences or Injuries I have done to them; and I am (I bless Almighty God) in perfect Charity with all Mankind. Robert Charnocke. Mr. KING's Paper. I Am now within a few Moments of Eternity, brought to this Place by the Just Hand of God in Punishment of all my Crimes; but particularly of that, of which I have been lately Arraigned, and for which I stand here Condemn'd; but I hope, that Goodness of God, which has given me a Sense of my Wickedness, will accept my Repentance, and shew Mercy on me; which I hope to obtain thro' the Pas∣sion and Merits of my Redeemer, upon whom I intirely cast my self. And that I may find his Mercy, I think my self oblig'd to do Justice to my Neighbour, that so none may suffer wrongfully on my Account; and therefore as I am soon to Answer the Truth of what I say before the Tribunal of God. I First declare, That I never saw any Order or Commis∣sion of King James's promoting the Asssination for which I am Condemned: Neither do I know of any such Order or Commission. Secondly, That this Design was not undertaken with any General Knowledge or Approbation of any Body of Men, either Catholick or Protestant.
Lastly, That I did not engage in it on Presumption of any King-killing Principles that cou'd justifie such an Undertak∣ing, but was drawn into it by my own Rashness and Passion, for which and all other Sins I heartily beseech God to for∣give me. And I hope that such who think the Misfortune of their Imprisonment or Trouble, is deriv'd from my having been engaged in this Enterprize; or such to whom it has any ways given scandal, that they will admit me to their Pardon, as I freely and heartily forgive all Mankind. In this Dispo∣sition of a sincere Repentance and true Charity, I commend my Soul into the Hands of God, and hope to find Mercy from him. And for this I beg all your Prayers. Edward King. Mr. KEY's Paper. I Am now going to appear before the Living God; I trust in his Mercy, that he will forgive all my Sins committed to this last moment of my Life. God is just in all his Judg∣ments, and I accept of this Death as the Punishment of my Iniquities: I forgive all my Enemies, and hope, through a hearty Repentance, and the Merits of my Saviour, to obtain Mercy. Have Mercy on me, O Father of Mercy, and through thy only Son forgive me all my Sins. Thomas Key. The next turn was Sir John Friend's and Sir Will. Perkins, both Tried, Condemned, and Executed in like manner for the same complicated Fact of the Assassination and Invasion, which was owned by them also, as appears by their own Words; the first in these Terms: Sir JOHN FREIND's Paper. KNowing that I must immediately give an Account to God of all my Actions, and that I ought to be espe∣cially careful of what I say in these last Hours, I do solemn∣ly profess, That what I here deliver, is from my very Soul, with all the Heartiness and Sincerity of a dying Christian.
The Cause I am brought hither to suffer for, I do firmly believe to be the Cause of God and True Religion, and to the best and utmost of my Knowledge and Information, agreeable to the Laws of the Land, which I have evermore heard to require a firm Duty and Allegiance to our Sove∣reign; and that as no Foreign, so neither any Domestick Power can alienate our Allegiance. For it is altogether new and untelligible to me, that the King's Subjects can depose and dethrone him on any account, or constitute any that have not an immediate Right in his Place. We ought, I think, not to do this; and surely when it is done, to assist him in the Recovery of his Right, is justifiable, and our Duty. And howsoever things may seem at present, I do be∣lieve, I am sure I heartily pray, That he shall be one day re∣stored to his rightful Throne and Dominions. As for any sudden Descent of his Majesty upon these his Dominions, in order to the Recovery of them, I declare I had no certain knowledge of it, nor can I tell what Grounds there was to believe it, so little Reason had I to be in a present Preparation for it. I suppose it is not expected I should endeavour to clear my self out of the Assassination, which was not the thing alledg'd against me; however, it was mentioned, through what means I know not: As it was insinuated to my disadvantage, I forgive such as were therein instrumental: And I do also from the very bottom of my Soul, freely forgive, and beg of God to do so too, suce as were any ways accessary towards the taking away my Life, which I really look upon to be their Misfortune more than mine. I profess my self, and I thank God I am so, a Member of the Church of England, though, God knows, a most unwor∣thy and unprofitable part of it; of that Church which suf∣fers so much at present for a strict adherence to Loyalty, the Law, and Christian Principles. For this I Suffer, and for this I Die. Though I have a perfect Charity for People of all Profes∣sions, and do heartily wish well, and would endeavour so to do, to all my Fellow-Subjects, of what Persuasions soever. And indeed, I have met with a great deal of Uprightness and Sincerity among some People of very different Opinions in Religious Matters. And I hope and desire it may not be taken as an unchari∣table Censure, or undue Reflection, that I objected to the Legality of the Popish Evidence, being advised so to do for my better Security, upon the Foundation of a Statute-Law.
Having own'd my self a Member of the Church of Eng∣land, I must take this Opportunity and I do it for God's Glory, to apply my self to you that are Royalists of that Church, of the same Faith and Principles with my self; and I beg of you for God's sake, and the Love of your Souls, to be very constant and serious in all Religious Offices, and holy Duties of Divine Worship and Service, which I have too much neglected, as I own to my great Sorrow: Let no Excuse, no Dangers, prevent or hinder you in these most ne∣cessary and serious Matters; and be, I beseech you, very careful and circumspect in all your Actions, Behaviour and Conversation, as I earnestly exhorted all that came to me. I have, I thank God, a great deal of Satisfaction in my present Sufferings, and have found it so ever since I have been under them: And blessed be God it doth continually increase upon me. And I do now lay down my Life with all Chearfulness and Resignation, in sure and certain Hope of a Resurrection to Eternal Life, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whose Merits alone I hope for the Pardon of my Sins, and the Salvation of my Soul. And so, O Lord, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit, for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou God of Truth. And I do heartily and humbly beseech thee, Almighty God, and my most Gracious ather, to forgive and bless this sinful Nation, deliver it from the Guilt of Rebellion, Blood and Perjury, is now on all sides more than ever, and from all those other hei∣nous Sins which cry aloud. Preserve and bless this Church; Com∣fort our distressed King; Restore him to his Right, and his mis∣lead Subjects to their Allegiance: Bless also his Royal Consort, our Gracious Queen Mary; his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, That he may grow in Stature, and in Favour with God and Man; Support and Strengthen all those that suffer in any kind for a good Cause; give them Patience under all their Af∣flictions, and a happy Deliverance out of them. Forgive all mine Enemies. Pardon my former Neglect, and remissness in Religious Wor∣ship, and Holy Duties, and all the Sins I have been guilty of to this very moment. Consider my Contrition, accept my Tears▪ And now Thou art pleased to take me hence, take me into thy Fa∣vour, and grant that my Soul may be without Spot presented unto Thee, through the Merits of thy Most dearly beloved Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. John Freind.
Sir WILLIAM PERKYNS's Paper. IT hath not been my Custom to use many Words and I shall not be long upon this Occasion, having Business of much greater Consequence to employ my Thoughts upon. I thank God I am now in a full disposition to Charity, and therefore shall make no Complaints, either of the Hardships of my Tryal, or any other Rigours put upon me. How∣ever, one Circumstance I think my self oblig'd to mention, it was Sworn against me by Mr. Porter, That I had own'd to him, that I had Seen and Read a Commission from the King, to Levy War upon the Person of the Prince of Orange: Now I must declare, That the Tenour of the King's Com∣mission, which I saw, was General, and directed to all his Loving Subjects, to Raise and Levy War against the Prince of Orange and his Adherents, and to seize all Forts, Castles, &c. which, I suppose, may be a customary Form of giving Authority to make War; but, I must confess, I am not much acquainted with Matters of that Nature: But, as for any Commission, particularly levelled against the Person of the Prince of Orange, I neither saw nor heard of any such. It's true, I was privy to the Design upon the Prince, but was not to act in it; and I am fully satisfied, that very few, or none, knew of it, but those who undertook to do it. I freely acknowledge, and think it for my Honour to say, That I was entirely in the Interest of the King, being al∣ways firmly persuaded of the Justice of his Cause, and look∣ed upon it as my Duty, both as a Subject, and an English∣man, to Assist him in the Recovery of his Throne, which I believed him to be deprived of, contrary to all Right and Justice; taking the Laws and Constitution of my Country for my Guide. As for my Religion, I die in the Communion of the Church of England, in which I was Educated. And as I freely forgive all the World, so who-ever I may any ways have Injured, I heartily ask them Pardon. April 13. 1696. William Perkyns. Here the Bigottry of these poor and wretched Men can∣not but be admired and pitied, that they should justifie their Treasons to the last Gasp, which hot-headed Charnock did not think fit to do. But this can be attributed to nothing else, save the blind Zeal and rebellious Principles of those
Clergy-men that were with them; and who fairly, if they had had their Desert, should have been hang'd, for Admini∣string Absolution to them without any precedent Confession, in direct Opposition to the Laws of that Church, whereof they would be thought Members, which thereupon was con∣demned by 14 Bishops, being all that were then in London, and assented to by all the rest that were Absent. It's well they liv'd under so mild a Government, though they were unworthy of it; had they been guilty in the late Reigns of any that had come near the pitch of their Crime, they had infallibly swung for it; when Julian Johnson was so severely Whipped and barbarously Used for his honest Address to the English Soldiery and Seamen. The other 3 that follow∣ed, viz. Cranborn, Rookwood, and Lowick, all confessed the Crime, though in a different manner; but the 2 latter who were Roman Catholicks, somewhat more modestly than the former, tho' a pretended Protestant, who called it a righte∣ous Cause for which he suffer'd. The Papers they deliver'd were these: Major LOWICK's Paper. In the Name of the most Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Amen. IN the first place, I die in the Religion I was Baptized, (viz.) Roman Catholick, and humbly beg the Prayers of all Good People, for a happy Resurrection, and of all Catho∣licks, for the Good of my Soul. As for being ingag'd in this for which I die, it was never so positive that I had a Horse, from the beginning to the very last, nor never see any allotted me, or the two Men I was to provide, as was sworn against me at my Tryal, nor had I any on that Account; nor was I at any of their Meetings when they settled any such thing. And as for any Order of Commission from King James, I never see any since I came last into England, which is now above 5 Years; and I am confident none that knows King James, will believe he would give any such Order. Indeed, I must confess, I believe King James was a com∣ing to assert his own Right; and I should, if on Shore, have done any thing in my Power to have assisted him, and in order to that I should have been very glad to have had a Horse, but never had any. And as for being concern'd in any Bloody Affair I never was in my Life, but have done my Endeavour to prevent, as much as I could on all Occasions; and if the Killing the most miserable Creature in the World (or greatest Enemy) would
now save my Life, restore the King, and make me one of the greatest Men in England, I first would chuse to die, be∣cause against the Law of God. If any who are now Sufferers on this Account, think I have been too forward, and a Promoter of this Design, I do now declare, it was never my Inclination to do any rash thing. However, I beg their Pardons, and of all the World I have offended, either in Thought, Word, or any Action whatsoever, and do freely forgive my Enemies, and hope through the Mercy of my Saviour Jesus Christ, to have Re∣mission of all my Sins. Good God preserve the King, Queen, Prince, and Princess, and all that Royal Blood of Stewards, and may England never want one of that direct Line to Go∣vern them, and make them once more Happy. I have had the Honour to serve my Royal Master in several Commis∣sions, and the last as Major, and strove ever to serve him to the best of my Power, and even to be Just to those who I had the Honour to Command. Lord Jesus, into thy Hands I recommend my Spirit! O Jesus receive my Soul! Robert Lowick. Brigadier ROOKWOOD's Paper. HAving committed the Justice of my Cause, and recom∣mended my Soul to God, on whose Mercies, through the Merits of Jesus Christ, I wholly cast my self, I had once resolved to die in Silence; but second Thoughts of my Du∣ty to others, chiefly to my True and Liege Soveraign King James, moved me to leave this behind me. I do therefore with all Truth and Sincerity, declare and avow, That I never knew, saw, or heard of any Order or Commission from King James, for the Assassinating the Prince of Orange, and Attacking his Guards; but I am certainly in∣form'd, That he, the best of Kings, had often rejected Pro∣posals of that Nature, when made unto him. Nor do I think he knew the least of the particular Design of the Attacking the Guards at his Landing, so much talk'd of, in which I was engaged as a Soldier by my immediate Commander, much against my Judgment; but his Soldier I was, and as such, I was to obey and act according to Com∣mand. These twelve Years I have served my true King and Ma∣ster, King James, and freely now lay down my Life in his Cause. I ever abhorr'd Treachery, even to an Enemy: If it
be a guilt to have complied with what I thought, and still think to have been my Duty, I am guilty. No other guilt do I own. As I beg all to forgive me, so I forgive all from my Heart, even the Prince of Orange, who, as a Soldier, ought to have consider'd my Case before he Sign'd the Warrant for my Death. I pray God may open his Eyes, and render him sen∣sible of the much Blood, from all Parts, crying out against him, so to prevent a heavier Execution hanging over his Head, than what he inflicts on me. Amb. Rookwood. But I confess, after all, that the Shouting of the People at the Execution of some of these wretched Assassins, was cruel, and inhumane, and two base a Triumphing over Misery, which always deserves our Christian Compassion. As soon as the News reached Flanders,The Confe∣derates buru the French Magazine at Givet. that the King was safe, and England happily delivered from the two bloody Tempests that threaten'd her, the Generals (and it was thought to be the particular Contrivance of Prince Vaudemont) be∣thought themselves of making an extraordinary Bonfire for Joy, by burning the French Magazine at Givet: To which End, after several Orders and Countermands given to the Garrison of Namur, the greatest part of them were ordered to march, with Provision for six Days; and being joined by several other Troops, they crossed the Meuse on the 12th of March, and were followed the next Day by the Horse, un∣der the Conduct of the Earl of Athlone and Major-General Cohorne; and having crossed the River Leile, the Earl, with one part of this Body, marched towards Dinant, while Co∣horne, with the rest, sate down before Givet; And having got all things ready by the 16th in the Morning, he began his Work about Seven a Clock, with Bombs and Red-hot Bul∣lets, which first set fire to the Forage; and at the same time a certain Number of Soldiers were commanded to enter the Town, with lighted Flambeaux in their Hands, who fired the Cazerns, and other Edifices, where the Magazines of Oats and other Provisions lay: So that that vast Magazine was ut∣terly consumed; and all this performed with the Loss of not above 9 or 10 Men. But notwithstanding this considerable Advantage to the Confederates, the Conspiracy in England, and other more than ordinary Affairs before the Parliament, had spun out so much Time, that the King could not be so early in the Camp this Year as was designed; who was himself also un∣willing to leave his Kingdoms, till the Arrival of the Fleet from Cales under Sir George Rook, who had, upon occasion of the first breaking out of the Plot, Orders sent him to return
home, and safely came upon the Coast towards the latter end of April, to the dissipating of the great Fears we were in, lest the French Fleet from Thoulon should overtake and ruine him. And indeed, they were not far behind; for before the Junction of those Men of War we had then in the Downs with some of Sir George's Squadron, and that he could get up∣on the Coast of Brest, in order to intercept and fight them, they were got safe into that, and the other Harbours of France: So that the French took the Field before the Confede∣rates, to whom they were superiour at first in number, till the Junction of the German Troops, who ever came late, which was at all times a prodigious Disadvantage to the Con∣federates: So that what with these things, but most of all for the extream Want of Mony to pay the Army, now our Coin was called in, the Confederates could not act Offensively, as they had done the preceding Year. But about the time that the King arrived at the Hague, there happen'd something to fall out, which began to savour of somewhat else than the Toils and Inconveniences of War; for Monsieur Caillieri was come thither, from France, with Proposals towards conclud∣ing a general Peace, by setling such Preliminaries as might be a sufficient Basis to ground a Treaty upon. I do not know whether there was any real Disposition in the French Court to a general Peace before the Year 1695; but the loss of Namur, Casall, and other Disadvantages, did, without all doubt, powerfully operate towards it; and nothing could have retarded their Motions in order to it, but the Plausibi∣lity of the Invasion against England, and that in such an ha∣zardous Juncture, when our Coin was in so bad a State. But the former, as has been related, utterly failing, and a visible Prospect of our weathering the Point as to our Mony, there was now no Room for, nor Occasion of Delay. But of these Proceedings, in relation to a general Peace, we shall have Occasion to speak hereafter, as we shall of the particular one that was at hand, when we have first dispatched our English Affairs. Tho' our Armies could do little,The Bomb∣ing of Calais, St. Martins, &c. for the aforesaid Reasons, by Land this Campaign, our Fleet was not altogether idle by Sea. I confess, the Bombarding of Calais, which happen'd before the Spring of the Year was spent, and as soon as we could get our Bomb-vessels ready, had not that Success that might have been desired: However, the Damage was not so inconsiderable as the French Gazeteer would have made it; some Letters at that time from France owning that there were 75 Houses burnt and spoiled, besides the Church and Convent, and some part of the Cazern. However, the Fleet had much better Success in their Attempt upon the Isle of , where it arrived on the 14th of July, under the Com∣mand
of the Lord Berkeley, when the Men of War came to an Anchor, while the Galliots advanced within three quar∣ters of a Mile of St. Martin's, in the said Island, and at Nine a Clock at Night they began to bombard it, which set the Town on fire in five several places, three of which the French made a shift to quench, but the other two continued to burn with great Violence. From Three next Morning, till the same Hour in the Afternoon, they forbore Bombing; at which time, the Tide serving, they began their Work again, which continued till Four next Morning; whereby the Town was set on fire in several places, and the greatest part of it con∣sumed or destroyed; as was also a Ship in the Road, besides a Feluca laden with Salt and Brandy, which they took at their coming away. The French were in a manner, surprized in this Attempt; so that what with that, and the dexterous Working of our Bombardeers, there was greater Executice done upon this Town, than any other we had attempted since the Burning of Diepe; Tho' they could not succeed so well upon Olonne, which was next attempted, through a Mistake of the Situation of the Place; yet there was considerable Damage done there also. But while these things were doing by the Bomb-Galliots and light Frigats, my Lord Berkeky landed in the Isle of Groa, near Port Louis; and in two others, near Bell Isle; where the Soldiers destroyed about 20 Villages, burnt 1300 Houses, and brought away a Booty of 1600 Head of Cattle. Besides this, the Fleet took 20 Barks, and a Vessel from New-found-land; and re-took one of our West-India Ships, together with a small Frigat which the Privateers of St. Malo's had taken. And so ended our Summer's Expedition; which, tho' perhaps somewhat ex∣aggerated on our part, yet certainly, the Damage must be very great; and all the Flourishes in the World could not make it appear to be otherwise. Having spent some Time in this manner, to give an Ac∣count of the Proceedings of our Fleet against those Ports of France which look towards Spain, we shall see first what has been done there, before we enter upon other Occurrences of the Year.The Fight between the French and Spaniards  Cataonia. The Armies were pretty early in the Field on that side, where the Spaniards were still content to be on the Defensive, and perhaps would have been fully satisfied to have lain unmolested in their Camp near Ostalrick: But the French were not willing it should be so; and therefore, the Duke de Vendosme having passed the Ter, and understanding that the Spanish Cavalry, who had been encamped within their Lines, were advanced to observe him, he resolved to attack them first, which was done on the first Day of June: The Spaniards finding none but Horse appear against them in the Beginning, they stoutly stood their Ground, and forced some
of the French Squadrons to recoil: But when they saw their Numbers increase, and a good Party of the Infantry come up to support them, the Spaniards thought it their best way to retire within their Lines, which they did in very good Or∣der, making a Retreating Fight till they got under the Reach of their own Cannon, where the French, greedy of Pursuit, were but illy entertained by the Artillery, and forced to re∣tire with considerable Loss. But tho' the Spaniards own to have lost near 300 Men in all, yet they will have the Loss of the French to have been greater; which the other would by no means agree to, tho' they did not seem very well satisfied with the Action it self. I know of nothing else of moment that happen'd this way during the rest of the Campaign,The Cam∣paign in Germany. and therefore we will cross the Country, and observe that on the side of the Rhine, there was nothing memorable that came to pass: The French, in the Beginning of the Spring, bragged of their passing that River, and forcing the Prince of Baden to intrench himself in his Camp; to whom they offered Battle, which he durst not accept. But now, towards the latter end of the Year, the Prince, in his Turn, passes the Rhine, near Mentz; and being joined by the Hessian Troops, he advanced to New∣stadt, where the French lay so strongly encamped, that there was no forcing their Intrenchments: However, he had the Honour, for several Days to Cannonade them, not only in Newstadt, but in the very Trenches themselves. It was also so contrived, that General Thungen should have crossed the Rhine, not far from Philipsburgh, in order to have attacked the French in the Rear; But they being aware of it, sent the Marquiss d' Vxelles to oppose that Design: So that the Ger∣mans failing herein, as also in making an Incursion into Lor∣rain, with Palsi's Hussars, after they had got some Booty, and divers Hostages for Contribution, they repassed that River on the 8th of October, and then marched into their Winter-Quarters. But the main Business of this Summer seemed to be ma∣naged on the side of Italy;The sepa∣rate Peace of Savoy, and the Ma∣nagement of it. not so much in the Prosecution of the War, as in making up a separate Peace between Savoy and France; the Duke, it seems, being resolved, as he came last into the War, to be the first that would get out of it; without any Regard had to his Stipulations with the Confe∣derates, whereof we have already given an Account. I do take it for granted, that the French Army on that side, under the Command of the Mareschal de Catinat, was more formi∣dable than usual, and that they were much superiour in Num∣ber to the Confederates at the beginning of the Campaign; But that there was some Understanding between the Duke of Savoy and the Court of France before this, seems to be very
by Catinat's Proceedings; who, notwithstanding his Strength, and advancing near Turin, unopposed, gave the Duke Time enough to fortifie his Camp, and re-inforce his Army before the said City, and to draw a Line from the Doero, to the Po; which being once effected, the French could not think of Bombarding the Place, or forcing the Confede∣rates to a Battle. But tho' this Treaty was concerted before, amidst the Devotions at Loretto, where such a Business could be managed without being observed by the Ministers of the Allies; yet all the Artifice imaginable was made use of, to cover the Matter for a Time. To this End Catinat, as we have said, came from the Mountains of Savoy, into the Plains of Turin, threatning the Extirpation of the Name of the Pied∣montois; but stopped on a sudden, till he had slipped the Opportunity. And when he found he had given the Duke Time enough to fortifie himself; and, under pretence of strengthening the Army, had got his Fortresses clear of the Confederate Troops, the Mareschal removed farther off, to∣wards Pignerol; which occasioned various Speculations; And the more Clear-sighted began to suspect there was an Agree∣ment under-hand patched up between the two Parties: And there was an Adventure which happen'd much about the same time, that sufficiently discovered the Secrecy of the French Court in the Matter, as well as the Assurance they had of their Work being done on that side. There was a Discourse of some Mis-understanding between the Mareschal de Cainat and the Grand Prior of France, while the Army lay at Rivalta: For the Grand Prior urging two or three several times, that the Mareschal had favourable Opportunities to have gained considerable Advantages over the Confederates, and still desiring the Mareschal to make use of the Benefit of of Fortune's Offer, the Mareschal as often put him off with Refusals; which made the other, in the height of his Zeal, as believing the Mareschal to be guilty of Negligence or Cowardice, to write his Accusations to the French King, who could not forbear smiling all the while he read the Letter. However, he was so kind as to send him an Answer; and to let him know, that the Mareschal had obeyed his Orders, and that he would soon see the Reasons of his pretended Ne∣gligence unravelled. Not long after this, (on the 12th of July,) a Truce was concluded on for a Month; the Conse∣quence whereof was, the Exchanging of Hostages, and at last, the final Conclusion of a Peace; Which, if it had been gained on the Duke's part, without any Violation of his Honour, was very advantageous to him, and the rest of h∣ly: For the French made a Restitution to him of all the new Conquests they had made, as also of Pignerol, demolished; gave him 4000000 of Livres, towards the Reparation of the
Damages he had sustained during the War; engaged to as∣sist him, at the Charge of the French King, with 8000 Foot, and 4000 Horse; and because the Knot should be tied fast enough, his Daughter was to be married to the Duke of Burgundy, without any Portion. But I will not curtail the Treaty, which was sign'd Aug. 29. and runs as follows. THE Most Christian King having all along during this War maintained a sincere desire of procuring the Quiet of Italy, and it having pleased Almighty God to inspire his Royal Highness with the same Thoughts, his Majesty has given his full Power, Commission and Command, to the Sieur Rene de Troullay, Count de Tesse, Knight of the Orders of the King, Lieutenant General of his Armies, Colonel Ge∣neral of the Dragoons of France, Governour of Ipres, Lieu∣tenant General for the King in the Provinces of Maine and Perche, and at present Commanding for the King in the Countries and Places on the Frontiers of Piedmont. His Royal Highness having likewise on his Part given his Power and Commands to the Sieur Charles Victor, Marquess de Saint Thomas, Minister of State, and his said Royal Highness's Principal Secretary of State; the said Plenipotentiaries having reciprocally Exchanged the Original of their Commissions, by virtue of which they Treat, have agreed on these follow∣ing Articles. I. That there shall be from henceforth and for ever, a firm and sincere Peace between the King and his Kingdom, and his Royal Highness the Duke of Savoy and his Dominions, as if the said Peace had been never interrupted; and the King resuming the same Sentiments of Bounty he hath here∣tofore had for his Royal Highness, which he desires his Royal Highness to be perswaded of; his Royal Highness doth by this present Treaty entirely renounce all Engagements, and all Treaties made with the Emperor, with the Kings and Prin∣ces comprehended under the Name of the League or Con∣federacy; and doth undertake to employ all his Endeavours, and to do all that he can, in order to obtain of those Sove∣reign Powers, at least of the Emperor and King of Spain, a Neutrality for Italy, until the General Peace shall be Con∣cluded; and to signifie their Consents by a particular Trea∣ty, which shall be made to that purpose; or for want of such a Treaty by Declarations, which the said Emperor and the King of Spain shall make to the Pope, and to the Republick of Venice; and which shall be at the same time followed by the Retreat and Withdrawing of all the Forces which the Al∣lies have at present in Italy, as it shall be hereafter more particularly specified: And in case the above-mentioned
Princes do not Consent to such a Neutrality in Italy, at his Royal Highnesses's Instance, to the Emperor and to the King of Spain; his Royal Highness doth engage to enter into an Offensive and Defensive League with the King, un∣til a General Peace be Concluded, acting jointly with his Majesty's and his own proper Forces, as becomes good and sincere Allies for the Common Interest, and to make War against the State of Milan, and against all those who shall oppose this present Treaty's taking effect. And as an evi∣dent Demonstration of a Return of the King's Amity to∣wards his Royal Highness, his Majesty does willingly Con∣sent, and doth Promise, That the City and Cittadel of Pig∣nerol, the Fort of St. Bridgit, the Perouse, with other For depending on the same, shall be Demolished as to the For∣tifications only, at the King's Charges; and after the afore∣said Fortifications are Demolished, they shall all be restored to his Royal Highness, as well as all the Territories and Do∣minions comprised under the Name of the Government of Pignerol, and which did belong to the House of Savoy, before the Cession or Surrender, that Victor Amadeus, the first Duke of that Name, made unto Lewis the XIIIth. The which City, dismantled Cittadel, and demolished Forts and Terri∣tories, shall be likewise Surrendred to his Royal Highness, to be held in Soveraignty, and to be by him enjoyed fully and perpetually, by him and his Successors from henceforth, as things to him of Right belonging. By virtue of which present Surrender, his Royal Highness doth Engage and Pro∣mise, as well for himself, his Heirs and Successors, or others by any ways Claiming, neither to Re-build, no cause to be Re-built the aforesaid Fortifications; nor to cause any new ones to be Built upon, and in the Space and Limits of the said Territories, Funds and Rocks, neither in any Place whatsoever, so surrendred by this present Treaty; accord∣ing to which, his Royal Highness, or the Inhabitants of the said Town of Pignerol, shall be allowed to enclose it with a bare Wall only, not Terrassed, and without Fortifications. That notwithstanding these mention'd, his Royal Highness shall be free to Build any strong Places and Fortifications in this said Territory now delivered up, as he thinks fit, with∣out the King's taking any Exception at it. That moreover, the King shall restore to his Royal Highness, the Countries, Castles and Places of Montmelian, Nice, Villefranche, Suza and all other the Conquer'd Places, without Exception, entire, and undemolish'd or damag'd, and with the same quantity of Ammunitions of War, Provisions, Stores, Canon and Ar∣tillery, and such Places to be left furnished, as they were when they fell into his Majesty's Hands; and so that the Buildings, Fortifications, Inlargements and Improvements,
made by his Majesty, shall not be touched, but left as they are: After the said Places are restored, it shall be lawful for his Royal Highness to repair and enlarge the Fortifications as things belonging to himself, that the King may not there∣fore molest him, or be displeased thereat. Provided never∣theless, That the King shall carry off from Pignerol, all the Artillery, Ammunition of War and Provisions, Arms, and all moveable Effects belonging to him, of what Nature soever they be. That as for the Revenues and Incoms of Pignerol and its Dependencies, the King does yield them up to his Royal Highness in the same manner as the King enjoys them at present; and the Leases or Settlements which the King has made of any of the said Lands, shall stand good, accord∣ing to the Form of the respective Contracts, Tenures, or Acquisitions: That the said Restitution of these Countries and Places belonging to his Royal Highness, as also the de∣livery of Pignerol with its Dependencies above-mentioned, shall be made after the signing of this present Treaty; the Foreign Troops being first quite retired out of Italy, and after that the Germans, the Troops of Bavaria, the Branden∣burg Protestants in the English Pay, and other Auxiliary Troops are actually arrived in Germany; and that the Spa∣niards and others which are paid by his Catholick Majesty, are returned into the Territories of Milan; so that the Exe∣cution of any of these Articles, nor the Restitution of any of those Places, shall not take Effect till after the said Troops are all of them, and entirely retired, in such manner as has been now exprest: Which, notwithstanding, it is to be so understood, as that the Evacuation of the said Foreign Troops out of Italy, shall be deemed to be fully compleated, altho' the Spaniards should take out, as possibly they may, some Men out of those Foreign Regiments, to fill up those that are in their own Pay; or that some of those Foreign Troops should List themselves, and enter on the Territories of the Republick of Venice, it shall be taken as if they were arrived in Germany, as soon as they are upon the Venetians Ground, and are delivered over to the Service of that Common∣wealth: And after the Ratification of the present Treaty, Labourers shall be immediately set at work to sink Mines, and to do all other things that are necessary to the demo∣lishing of the said City, Cittadel and Forts of Pignerol. But in case his Royal Highness should think fit to keep this Treaty as yet secret, beyond the time limitted for the said Ratification, it is agreed upon, that to avoid the Noise which the working of such Mines might create, that they shall be begun but at such time after the Ratification as his Royal Highness shall think fit: The said demolishing Work shall continue and go forward in such a manner, as that in
two or three Months after the Evacuation of the said Troops above-mentioned, all shall be delivered up into his Royal Highness's Hands; whereupon it shall be allowed to send a Commissary to assist upon the Place, until the Execution of the said Work. His Majesty is also willing, for his Royal Highness's greater Satisfaction, to send him, when he shall require it, two Dukes and Peers of France, to remain as Ho∣stages in his Royal Highness's Hands, who shall treat them according to the Dignity of their Rank. II. His Majesty shall make no Treaty of Peace, or Truce with the Emperor, or the King of Spain, without compre∣hending his Royal Highness, in suitable and effectual Terms; and the present Treaty, as well as those of Querasque, Munster, the Pirerees and Nimeguen, shall be included in the General Peace, not only as to the Four Hundred Ninety Four Thou∣sand Crowns of Gold (which are particularly mentioned in that of Munster, in Discharge of his Royal Highness, and for which the King continues still a Guarrantee to the Duke of Martua) but also as to all other Matters contained in the said Treaties, not contrary to the present Treaty, which are to be irrecoverable, and to remain in full Force and Va∣lidity, notwithstanding the present Delivery of Pignerol and its Dependencies: And as for other Interests, Claims, or Pretensions which concern the House of Savoy, his Royal Highness reserves to himself a Power of Treating about them by way of Protestations, of Memorials, or by Envoys, so that this Treaty may in no ways be prejudicial to the said Protestations. III. That a Marriage between the Duke of Burgundy, and the Princess, his Royal Highness's Daughter, shall be treated on out of Hand, to be consummated when they are of Age, and the Contract between them to be made so soon as this pre∣sent Treaty takes effect; after Publication whereof, the Princess shall be put into the King's Hands. That in the said Marriage-Contract, which shall be consider'd as an es∣sential part of this Treaty, and wherein the Princess shall make the usual Renunciations, with a Promise to pretend to nothing of his Royal Highness's Estate or Succession, further than the following Portion: His said Royal Highness shall give as a Portion to the Princess his Daughter, Two Hun∣dred Thousand Crowns of Gold; toward the Payment of which, his Royal Highness shall give a Discharge for One Hundred Thousand Crowns of Gold, which remained due (by France to the House of Savoy) as part of the Dutchess-Royal's Portion, together with the accruing Interest of that said Sum, which was also promised to be paid: And the
Remainder, (viz, One Hundred Thousand more, which the Duke of Savoy shall pay to France, to make up the Portion aforesaid) the King doth Remit, in Consideration of the pre∣sent Treaty; his Royal Highness engaging more-over, to give to the Princess, his Daughter, at the Celebration of the Marriage, that, which in the Language of Piedmont, is cal∣led Fardle; and in French, the Bundle, or Marriage Present, for Cloaths; and in the Contract of Marriage, the Dowry shall be agreed upon, which the King will give according to the Custom of France. IV. That his Royal Highness, renouncing from this present time, truly, and effectually, and sincerely, (as he hath done in the fore-mentioned Articles) all the Engagements which he might have had with the Enemies, doth likewise hope, that his Majesty will answer thereunto, with all the Senti∣ments which his Royal Highness craves and wishes for; and that having the Honour to be so nearly related to the King, and of entring into a new and glorious Alliance with him, his Majesty doth Grant and Promise, to his Royal Highness, as he doth demand, his powerful Protection, as formerly, in all its Extent; and as his Royal Highness is desirous to maintain a perfect Neutrality with the Kings, Princes, and Sovereign Powers, who are at present his Allies, his Majesty doth promise, not to put any manner of Restraint on the In∣clinations which his Royal Highness hath, of continuing and using towards them, all the external Measures of Decency and Freedom, that are becoming a Sovereign Prince, who hath Embassadors and Envoys at the Courts of those Princes, and receives and entertains, at his own Court, Envoys and Embassadors from them; and that the King shall in no ways take ill his so doing; comprehending under that Word Prin∣ces, the Emperor, Kings, and Sovereign Powers of Eu∣rope. V. His Majesty doth ingage and declare, That the ordinary and extraordinary Embassadors of Savoy shall receive at the Court of France, all the Honours without Exception, and with all the Circumstances and Ceremonies that are paid to the Embassadors of Crowned Heads; that is to say, they shall be received as Embassadors from Kings; and that his Majesty's ordinary, as well as extraordinary Embassadors in all the Courts of Europe, without Exception, and even the King's Embassadors at Rome and Vienna shall likewise treat and use the said ordinary and extraordinary Embassadors and Envoys from Savoy, as they do those from Kings and Crown∣ed Heads. But in regard that this Addition of Honour, as to the Treatment of the Embassadors from Savoy, has been
never hitherto settled nor raised to that Degree that his Majesty doth now allow it, his Royal Highness is sensi∣ble and doth acknowledge, that it is in Consideration of this Treaty, or Contract of Marriage of the Duke of Burgundy with the Princess his Daughter; and his Majesty doth pro∣mise that this Augmentation of Honour shall take Place from the Day that the aforesaid Treaty of Marriage is Sign∣ed. VI. That the Trade between France and Italy shall be renew∣ed and maintained in the same manner as it was settled be∣fore this War, from the time of Charles Emanuel II. his Royal Highness's Father; and the same shall be observed, and practised in all Points, and in all Places between the Kingdom and the several parts of his Majesty's Dominions, and those of his Royal Highness's, which was used and pra∣ctised in all things in the Life-time of the said Charles Ema∣nuel II. on the Roads of Suza in Savoy, and Pont Beauvoisi, and Villefranche, every one paying the Duties and Customs on both Sides, the French Ships shall continue to pay the ancient Duties at Villefranche, as it was wont to be paid in the time of the said Charles Emanuel; about which there shall be no Contest or Opposition made, any more than used to be done in those Days. The Couriers and ordinary Pos of France shall pass, as formerly, through his Royal High∣ness's Estates and Countries, and according to the Regula∣tions there, they shall pay the Duties for the Merchandizes wherewith they shall be charged. VII. His Royal Highness shall cause an Edict to be published, by which he shall upon the Penalty of severe corporal Pu∣nishments, forbid the Inhabitants of the Vallies of Lucern, called Vaudois, to have any Communication, in Matters of Religion, with the King's Subjects; and his Royal High∣ness shall engage, not to suffer at any time from the Date of this Treaty, any of his Majesty's Subjects to make any Settlement in the Protestant Vallies, under Colour of Reli∣gion, of Marriage, or for any other Pretence of Settlement, Conveniency, taking Possession of Inheritances, or any other Pretence whatsoever, and that no Protestant Minister shall come thence into any of his Majesty's Dominions, without incurring the severest corporal Punishments. That however, his Majesty shall take no Cognizance of his Royal High∣ness's Usage towards the Vaudois, in regard of their Religi∣on; yet his Royal Highness shall be bound not to suffer the Exercise of the Reformed Religion in the City of Pignero, nor in the Territories that are restored to his Royal High∣ness,
in like manner as his Majesty neither doth, nor will allow the Exercise of it in his Kingdom. VIII. That there shall be on both sides a perpetual Act of Ob∣livion and Indemnity of all that has been done since the be∣ginning of this War, in what Place soever the Acts of Hosti∣lity have been committed; That in this Act of Grace, all those shall be comprehended who have served his Majesty in what Station soever, although they were his Royal Highness's Subjects; so that no Prosecution shall be made against them, neither shall they be molested, either in their Persons or E∣states, by Reprisals, Executions, or Judicial Processes, or upon any pretext whatsoever; and the King's Subjects that have served his Royal Highness shall be used in the like manner. IX. That Ecclesiastical Benefices in such parts of his Royal Highness's Country as hath been conquered by the King, having been filled up by his Majesty from time to time, as the same became vacant, during the time that his Majesty possessed the said Countries; it is agreed, that the said Col∣lation to Benefices shall be valid, and the Persons who have been promoted by the King, and invested by Authority of the Pope's Bulls, shall remain in full Possession thereof. But as to the Promotions to the Livings belonging to the Mili∣tary Order of St. Maurice, or to the Places of Judicature or Magistracy, his Royal Highness shall have Liberty to alter the Nominations made by the King; and all Grants made by his Royal Highness, of Offices in the Law, become va∣cant by the Person's leaving them, during the War, shall re∣main good and valid. X. As for Contributions that were imposed on the Lands of his Royal Highness's Dominions, altho' they are lawfully imposed, and are become due, and that they amount to con∣siderable Sums, his Majesty does, out of his Liberality, ful∣ly discharge his Royal Highness of them; so that from the Day of this Treaty's Ratification, the King will not pretend to, nor require any of the said Contributions, leaving his Royal Highness in full Possession of his Revenues through∣out his Dominions, as well as in Savoy, Nice, about Pigne∣rol, and Suza; his Royal Highness on the other side, not demanding any Contributions of the King. XI. As to the Pretensions of the Dutchess of Nemours on his Royal Highness, his Majesty leaves those Controversies to be determined among themselves by due Course of Law, with∣out concerning himself further therein.
XII. That it shall be lawful for his Royal Highness to send In∣tendants and Commissaries into Savoy, the Country of Nice, the Marquisate of Suza and Barcellonet, into Pignerol and its Dependencies; in order to Regulate his Interests, Rights and Revenues, and to settle his Customs and Excises upon Salt and other things. And the said deputed Persons shall be admitted and authorised in their Offices, immediately after the Ratification of this present Treaty: after which the said Duties shall belong to his Royal Highness, without Exception or Contradiction. XIII. That if the Neutrality for Italy be accepted, or that a General Peace be Concluded, as in such Cases a great ma∣ny Troops would become altogether Useless and Charge∣able to his Royal Highness; and that besides the excessive Charges requisite for the maintaining of them, they com∣monly become an occasion of creating a mis-understanding among Princes, when more Troops are kept on Foot than are necessary in a State, either for its own Conservation, or for the maintaining of the Dignity of a Sovereign Prince; his Royal Highness doth therefore oblige himself, not to keep in times of Neutrality, any more than Six thousand Foot on this side the Alpes, and One thousand five hundred on the other side of the Mountains, for the Garrisons of Savoy, and of the County of Nice, and One thousand five hundred Horse or Dragoons; and this Obligation is to continue only till the General Peace be Concluded. We the above-mentioned Plenipotentiaries have agreed upon, and signed these present Articles; and we do pro∣mise and engage to procure them to be ratified and con∣firmed by his Majesty, and by his Royal Highness; pro∣mising likewise, that they shall be kept secret till the end of September next; and if at that time new Articles are made, to the same Sense and purpose, then these shall be suppressed. Dated at Turin the Twenty Ninth of August, 1696. Rhene de Froullay, and Saint Thomas. And because some may be curious to see the French King's Act of Surrender of the Country of Savoy to the Duke, it was conceived in these Terms.
BE it known to all Persons whatsoever, That in pursu∣ance of a Treaty of Peace made and signed between his most Christian Majesty, Lewis XIV. King of France and Na∣varre, on the one part; and his Royal Highness, Victor Ama∣deus II. Duke of Savoy, Prince of Piedmont, King of Cyprus, &c. on the other Part, That his most Christian Majesty hath gi∣ven Orders to Monsieur Anthony Balthasar, Marquiss de Thoy, Major General of the Armies of France, and Governour of Savoy, to restore entirely to his Royal Highness, all the Countries, Places, Castles and Fortresses of all Savoy, except Montmilian, and to draw out all the Troops that are there, pursuant to his Majesty's Letters Patents. To this end his Royal Highness hath sent the Marquiss of Thana, Captain of his Life Guards, Major General of his Army, and Gover∣nour of Savoy, with a Power to receive, in his Royal High∣ness's Name, all the said Estates and Places. The said Mar∣quiss de Thoy having therefore personally appeared in the Council-Chamber of the Town-Hall of Chambery, and having there assembled the Nobility, the Syndics, and Counsellors of the said City; and the said Marquiss of Thana there like∣wise appearing, did then and there receive from the said Marquiss de Thoy, an absolute and full Surrender, in the Name of his most Christian Majesty, of all the Countries, and of all the Places of the Dutchy of Savoy, Montmelian only ex∣cepted, according to the Treaty of Peace. The said Marquiss de Thoy expressing the same in these following Words: viz. My Lord Marquess de Thana, in Pursuance of an Order from the King my Master, and according to the Power you have also received from his Royal Highness, I do hereby make an entire Surrender and Restitution to his Royal Highness in your Person, of all the Countries and Places, and of all the Dependencies of the Estate of Savoy, Montmelian ex∣cepted, and his Royal Highness may accordingly dispose of the same, in like manner as he had done before those Estates were conquered by the King's Arms. To which the Mar∣quiss of Thana answered, That he received in his Royal High∣ness's Name, the aforesaid Countries, Places and Depen∣dencies. This done, the Marquiss de Thoy repeated once more the Words of the said Surrender, and then went out of the Town House. Of all the aforesaid Transactions, both the said Marquesses de Thoy and Thana, caused an Act to be made before Pub∣lick Notaries, which was signed, Thoy de Pisen. & Marquiss de Thana. As Witnesses. Syndics. Favre de Charmettes. Perin. Cugnet. Tonce. Syndics. I Jasper Chambet, Notary and Burgess of Chambery, have receiv'd and passed the present Act as required. Signed, G. Chambet, Not.
When the News of this procedure came, our King was En∣camped at Gemblours, where Monsieur de la Tour, the Duke of Savoy's Envoy notified to him, the separate Peace which his Master had made with the French King, and that the Forces of the Allies were to depart his Country within such a limitted time, or be forced to it by his own Troops in Con∣junction with those of France; But that it was in the power of the Confederates to make a Neutrality which should include all Italy within the same time. I could never learn what An∣swer his Majesty gave the Envoy; but perhaps he was more concerned, that the Duke by Letter should excuse the mat∣ter to the Emperor, King of Spain, and Electors of Bavaria and Brandenburg, and yet not a line to him, than at the thing it self; and this procedure of the Dukes, makes that Ha∣range of his Envoy the Marquess de Govon to the late King James,The Envoy of Savoy's Harange, to the late K. James. in Sept. this Year, to be the more to be believed, the which, because so. Diametrically opposite to that we have gi∣ven you in the preceding part of this Book, which was made to his present Majesty, and our late Queen Mary of Happy Memory, and that it is a strange instance of the unconstan∣cy of sublunary things, take as follows: SIR, HIS Royal Highness is at length happily reconciled to his mst Christian Majesty, against whom he had rashly taken up Arms, tho' he has all along receiv'd sincere Proofs of His Majesty's Pro∣tection. The strict Leagues his noble Ancestors have heretofore had with France, and the more exact Alliance his Royal Highness has contracted by his Marriage, have but the more disjoyn'd him from the Interest of that Kingdom. This Vnion which ought to have been the most inviolable, we have lately seen interrupted by the Artifices of his most Christian Majesty's and your Majesty's E∣nemies; to whom his Royal Highness has been hitherto so weak as to give ear. His Royal Highness therefore humbly begs Your Majesty would please to pardon his past Conduct, so very contrary to his sincere Desires to re-establish your Majesty upon your Throne. The Injustice and Oppression of your Enemies, Sir, have caused his most Christian Majesty to engage in this War. God Almighty has hitherto favour'd his Attempts, because they are just; and 'tis al∣so to be hoped he will lend the like Attention to your Majesty's Pe∣tition. His Royal Highness, for his part, will contribute all in his Power thereunto, who likewise flatters himself, that this Treaty lately signed with his most Christian Majesty, may be a Means to divide these Princes (whose Vnion will infallibly oppose your Ma∣jesty's Return to your Dominions) which may facilitate a general Peace, the first Effects of which will undoubtedly be your Majesty's Re-establishment on your Throne. This has been the Occasion, Sir, of his Royal Highness's withdrawing from the Allies; and which
he hopes will be thought fully to answer his promises to your Ma∣jesty's Ministers, set to sollicite him in that behalf. This he would have perform'd sooner, but Your Majesty may be inform'd from the most Christian King, what Reasons inclined him to the contrary. These, Sir, are the sincere Protestations of his Royal Highness, which he will endeavour to make appear by his continu∣ed Prayers for the Prosperity of your Sacred Majesty. But to return, the French King in Conformity to his Ar∣ticles, made a formal Resignation of all manner of preten∣tions to Savoy and the Dukes Territories, whilst his Royal Highness upon the expiration of the Truce, on the 15th of Sept. put himself at the head of the French and his own Troops to drive his Friends the Allies out of Italy,Valentia Be∣ieged by the French and Savoy∣ards. or to accept of a Neutrality for it: A strange Metamorphosis, and such as (I think) cannot be parallel'd in any History Ancient or Mo∣dern, that one and the same Prince, who equals himself to Crown'd Heads, should successively in one and the same Cam∣paign, Command the two Armies of two Enemies: This was a pace none of his Ancestors ever made, though they shew∣ed themselves unconstant enough between the French and Spanish Crowns upon divers occasions. But so it was, that the Duke marched at the head of his Army, and laid Siege to Valentia, a Citty in the Dutchy of Milan, belonging to the King of Spain, which was carried on with much Vigour while the Treaty was agitated on both sides, by the Prince of Fundi from the Emperor, Marquess of Leganez on the part of the Spaniards, the Lord Gallaway for the King of England, and the Marquess de St. Thomas for the Duke of Savoy, and many Conferences were held, before they could be brought to any Conclusion. But though the French and Savoyards were so eager to take Valentia, they found an harder thing of it than was expected, having lost above 3000 Men be∣fore it, and the approach of the bad Weather and the Winter Season, made the matter very Dubious at last; and things on all hands were brought to this Crisis on both sides, whe∣ther the French should run the hazzard and Dishonour that would accrue to them of raising the Siege, or whether the Confederates would venture the losing of it, and with that protract the War in Italy: But all Parties having considered the advantages and disadvantages, the Neutrality was agreed to, and signed upon the 7th of October, containing chiefly the following Articles: I. That there shall be a Neutrality,The Articles of Neutrali∣ty for Italy. or Suspension of Arms in Italy till a General Peace. II. That the Imperial and French Troops shall depart out of Italy, and return into their own Countries.
III. That in lieu of Winter Quarters, which the Princes of Ita∣ly were otherwise oblig'd to allow the Imperialists, they should fur∣nish them with 300000 Crowns; that is to say, One third before their Retreat, and the remainder at a time prefix'd, upon sufficient Security. IV. That so soon as the Imperialists should begin to March off with some part of their Troops, the French should proportionably do the like. V. That the Treaty should be ratifyed within two Days by the Duke of Savoy, by the Emperor within a Month, and within two by the King of Spain. Hereupon the Count of Thesse, and Mar∣quess de Vins were sent Hostages to Turin by the French, is were also the Prince of Trivultio, and the Marquess de Burgo∣maniero by the King of Spain, and the Marquess of St. Thomas to Milan by the Duke of Savoy. Things being thus concluded on in Italy, in respect to that particular Peace, there was a mighty Discourse all the while of a general One with the rest of the Confederates, and Mon∣sieur Dickvelt's going about the same time to the King's Camp, when News came to him of the former, made the same hotly Discoursed of; People supposing he came to His Majesty, to give an Account of his Negotiations about that important Affair: And that which confirmed Men more in this Opinion, was, That Monsieur Dickvelt made this Jour∣ney more than once between the Camp and the Hague; but this matter we shall pursue no further at present, it being time we should proceed to see the Operations of the Cam∣paign in Hungary this Year. The Armies on each side were Commanded by the same Generals as the preceding Year; the Grand Seignior pretty early in the Summer came to Belgrade at the head of very numerous Troops, while the Elector of Saxony, about the beginning of June, joined the Imperial Forces, whom he found to be so good, that according to all the Intelligence at that time of the Enemies Numbers, he might be able to fight them, or if they refused, to sit down before some con∣siderable place: Whereupon several Counsels of War were held, according to Custom, wherein it was resolved at length to Besiege Themeswaer, but whether it were really designed for a formal Siege, or that it was only a feint to draw the Mahometans to a Battle,Themeswaer Besiegd by the Imperia∣lists and quitted. is uncertain. However, the Duke approached the place, viewed it, raised Batteries, and in some measure made a formal Attack upon the Town; while advice came in the mean time thick and three-fold, that the Sultan was preparing to cross the Danube, with his whole Army, which made the Elector glad of the News, rise from before Themeswaer, and immediately to set forward to meet
the Infidels. But this proving to be a false Rumour, the E∣lector returned to attack the place again; though this was thought to have been done, that the Turks might be more eager to follow him, and indeed the Stratagem took: For the Sultan to divert him from the Siege, came on amain, which made the Elector to make some small motion towards the Enemy, to the end he might take his measures, to observe their Countenance and the Scituation of their Ground; So that the Imperialists continued their march, when on the 21st of August, by break of Day, they found the Turkish Chavalry begin to appear in very great Numbers, which made the Elector and General Capara, to cause the Army to march in order of Battle: But at the same time the Infidels came pour∣ing down upon the Christians, from several parts, with ex∣traordinary Fury: But they met with such Vigorous resi∣stance from every Quarter, that after a sharp Recounter, they were forced to retreat, and the Germans pursued them close at their Heels, with an intention to drive them upon their Infantry, in hopes to have come up with them the same Day, and to have attacked them successfully, considering the rout of their Cavalry, but therein they were prevented by the approach of Night. Next Day which was the 22d, the Elector sent a numerous Detachment to observe the Ene∣mies posture, who gave an account of their being strongly posted between two Morasses, that secured the Wings of their Army, and that they had planted several Cannon before them, and that the avenues of those Morasses were almost inaccessi∣ble. Whereupon it was concluded in a Council of War, that the Imperialists should retreat 3000 Paces towards the Moun∣tains in hopes to draw the Turks out of their Entrenchments, which was done next Day in order of Battle. On the 24th the Enemies appeared with a great part of their Army, but drew a new and third line so speedily, that it was finished before the Germans could fall upon them, so that there was no more done that Day, but Cannonading one anothers Camps: On the 24th the Imperialists made some little motion, and fell down into a Plain, having a River behind them in hopes to draw the Enemy out of their Retrench∣ments, yet that would not do neither: But upon the 25th, the Imperialists had advice, upon the return of their advanced Guards,The attle between the Imperialists and the Turks. that the Infidels began to appear, and were fetch∣ing a compass to fall upon the right Wing, being covered by a thick Wood, which was in part cut through, and separated the Enemy from that right Wing about a Leagues distance. It was thought at first to have been only some Detachment, but the Imperial Generals coming out with some Horse up∣on the Discovery, found it to be the whole Ottoman Army,
marching in a full Body towards them, and this was con∣firmed by a Prisoner that was taken immediately after. Upon this the Imperial Army was ranged in Order of Bat∣tle, with a Design to go and meet the Enemy; but they made so much speed, that before the Germans, uld cross the Woods, the Turks had posted themselves upon one Line between the Imperialists and Temeswaer, having a Wood be∣hind them, a tripple Range of Cannon in Front, their-Right Wing opposite to the Imperialists Left, and having a Morass upon their own Left Wing, which was the Reason the Im∣perialists could not press so close upon them as they wished. However, Six Battalions were commanded out, who entred the Wood about Five in the Afternoon, to charge the Tur in Flank, being seconded by two Regiments of Dragoons, while the Body of the Army advanced at the same time through the Wood. The Ottomans finding themselves very much annoyed, drew out their Horse, and detach'd again the Body of the Imperial Army that advanced in two Co∣lumns Twelve Thousand Senderbeegli's on Horseback, being a sort of People that usually run upon the hottest of the and fight like Madmen, in hopes of great Rewards, which the Sultans are wont to give them after the Battle is over. These Men, after they had forced the Calthorps of the Impe∣rialists, broke into the first Line, so that two Battalions were constrained to give way to their Fury; but they were soo after repulsed by some sent out for that purpose, and the Line was again closed by the same Battalions. In the mea time the six first Battalions fell upon the Janizaries behind the Barricade of Waggons, and that with so much resolute Bravery, that they drove them from thence; But the Ja∣saries fired so thick upon them, besides that they were at∣tacked in Flank with so much Fury by the Ottomon Horse, th they were forced to retire. The two Regiments of Dr∣goons that were to second them, had, at the same time, be∣gun to charge those Horse with good Success: But the J∣nisaries coming to their Succour, the Encounter was so rude that several Officers on both sides were slain, and some wound∣ed; and the said two Regiments of Dragoons being con∣strained to retire, were pursued by the Ottomans with gre Slaughter! But then General Heidersheim coming up with fresh Regiment of Horse, drove the Enemy within their ba∣ricado'd Waggons. There that gallant Commander, wh had been engaged in this War every Campaigne from th beginning of it, had the Misfortune to receive a dangerou Wound, which forced him to leave the Battle, and of whi he died after. While both Parties were thus contending on this side, th Enemies Cavalry poured in upon some of the Imperial Re∣giments
on the other, and having first put them to the Rout, broke in upon the Second Line, but they were stopped short by the Infantry, till the first Line was Closed again by some Regiments of Horse that were sent for from the other side, upon which, the same Regiments vigorously Repressed the Enemy, but were hindred (as was said,) from pursuing them by some unknown Order: However, some other Regiments of Horse pursued them with extraordinary Courage, even to their Barricades. Upon this there was some Foot immediate∣ly detached away, not only to supply the place which the Regiments of Horse had left void in the first Line, but to second them, and to endeavour both together, to force the Enemies Waggon-Barricades: But the Janisaries fired so fu∣riously upon the Imperialists, that they obliged them to Re∣tire, and being pursued by the Turks, the Retreat was so ha∣sty, that another Regiment of Horse was quite put out of order. But then the Regiment of Caprara's coming in seaso∣nably to their Relief, Charged the Enemy in Flank, and drove them back again to their Barricades with so much loss and confusion, that the Grand Seignior, who Commanded a Reserve of about 3000 Men in Person, at a little distance be∣hind the Barricades, had much adoe to stop the Run-a-ways, and to prevent his other Troops from forsaking the said Barricade; But Night coming on, it was not thought con∣venient to Attack them in their Barricades. However, the Elector kept the Army upon the Field of Battle at their Arms all Night, and offered the Sultan Battle next Day, which the other declined, and so ended this Battle, than which there has not been any one Fought with more Resolution and Bravery on both sides, in this Age, and it seemed to have been like a drawn Battle. The Loss in all appearance was not very different, for, the Christians did not make the Ene∣mies loss to exceed 4000 Men, and when they themselves on the other Hand have owned their's to have been about 3000, some small Deduction, for Partiallity will make it ve∣ry near the same. But tho neither side had any great rea∣son to boast of its Advantage this Campaign from this Battle; yet the Success Count Barthiani, Governour of Croatia, had in the mean time by the Taking of the strong Castle of Vranogratz, and the Fort of Tuderaw, altered the case in fa∣vour of the Germans. For the Reduction both of the one and the other, freed the Emperor's Territories from several Incursions of the Infidels that way, which very much annoy'd the Inhabitants of those Parts. We have but little to say of the Venetians this Year,Liberachi brought o∣ver to the Venetian  there being nothing done in the Morea, save the bringing over of the famous Basha, Liberachi, to the Interest of the Republick. He was a Native of Maina, formerly Leuctra (where Epina∣nondas
Conquered the Lacedemonians) and was said to have been Descended of the Ancient Kings of Sparta. He had been long detained in Prison at Constantinople, but was afterwards Released by the Sultan, who was in hopes that he would have Recovered the Morea from the Venetians, and for that reason, he Honoured him with several Titles, and Dignities, Married him to the Widow of the Hospodar of Moldavia, and gave him a large extent of Country: And certain it is, that he had not a little contributed to stop the Progress of the Venetian Arms. However, now he was brought over, and Conducted to Corinth, where the Venetian General re∣ceived him according to his Merits, and presented him with a Cross set with Diamonds. But for Dalmatia, the Repub∣lick thought to have extended their Dominions that way, by the Reducing of Dulcigno,Dulcigno Besieged by the Veneti∣ans. which was invested by their Forces on the 12th of August, but tho' General Delphino car∣ried the Works on with great Application, and Routed 5000 Turks that came to Relieve it, the Consequences of which was his Taking the Town, yet the Castle made a Vigorous Defence, which gave the Basha of Scutari opportunity to At∣tempt the Relief of it a second time, and to that purpose fell upon both the Wings of the Venetians with much Fury, but being Repulsed with no less Vigour, the Morlakes pursued them with great Slaughter, and the loss of 12 Colours. But notwithstanding this double Rout of the Turks, and after all the Efforts of the Venetians to Reduce the Castle, they were forced to give over the Enterprize,The Sege raised. and to content themselves to lay the Country waste round about it, many Miles, and to destroy above 60000 Olive Trees that brought in a great Revenue to the Enemy. Yet they valued themselves very much upon their Fleet's Beating that of the Turks, under Mezzomorto, tho according to the Relation themselves have given of it, it does not seem to have been proportionably considerable, the Fight was briefly thus: General Molino set∣ting Sail from the Gulph of Eugenia upon the last of July, with the Gallies and Galleasses, and having sent away the Men of War to Andros with Orders to make as if they intend∣ed to Land, and by that means to try whether they could draw the Turkish Fleet to an Engagement, received intelligence, that Mezzomorto the Turkish Admiral, had appeared near Castella Resto,Te Veneti∣ans Beat te Tuks by Sa. not far from Negropont, with 36 Men of War, two Fire ships, and 46 Galliots and long Barks. Where∣upon the Venetian General upon the 9th of August, quitted the Gulph of Eugenia with the Gallies and Galleasses, in or∣der to joyn the Men of War, and then to meet the Enemy; But this Conjunction, thro the Badness of the Weather, could not be till the 21st, at what time the General calling a Coun∣cil of War, it was resolved to fall upon the Enemy, and to
this purpose, to Tow their Men of War with their Gallies, because of the Calm. But because the Turks caused the Men of War to be Towed in like manner by their Galliots, and Long Barks towards the Golden Cape, it was 19 of the Clock, according to the Italian way of reckoning, before the Vanguard of the Venetian Fleet, consisting of 8 Men of War, could come up with them. However, tho' they had the Ad∣vantage of keeping their Fleet close upon a Line, whereas the Body of the Venetian Fleet could not get up, because of the Calm, Molino engaged the Left Wing of the Turkish Fleet, whilst the 8 above-mentioned Vessels, and Galleasses, fell upon the Right with extraordinary Vigour and Brave∣ry: The Fight continued till it was very dark, when the Turkish Line was broke, and their Fleet began to bear away with all the Sail they could make, and got next day into the Port of Scio, where they staid two days longer to Refit: Three of their Ships being so battered, that they were for∣ced to take out their Guns, and Three of their Galliots, and a Sultana lost in the Fight, with 600 Men killed, besides several wounded: But the Venetians lost never a Vessel, and but a very few Men. From thence General Molino sailed back to Andros, thence to Fina, or Tenos in the Gulph of Evenay, but they got safe into Rhodes, and Molino had no more to do than to return to Napoli di Romania. It cannot be expected there should have been any great Feats done, more especially this Year, by the Polish Arms, since the whole Kingdom wanted an Head to govern it, (the same be∣ing Elective) by the Death of its brave King John Sobieski, the Third of that Name;The death of the King of Poland. who departed this Life on the 17th Day of June, of an Apoplectick Fit, being above 70 Years of Age. His Decease (as it usually happens in such Cases) was attended with much Confusion, (which frequent∣ly falls out in Elective Kingdoms) because of the Competi∣tors making Parties, and other Humours that break forth thereupon. But of this we shall have Occasion to speak hereafter; and therefore, leaving at present the Cardinal Primate to take upon him the Administration of the Govern∣ment, we will pass into Moscovy, of which Empire we have hitherto had little to say; But now you will hear of some∣thing to the purpose. For whereas we heard nothing all along before,The Czar of Moscovy routs the Turks by Sea, and takes Asoph. but the Marching of their Armies into the Field, without any me∣morable Undertaking, it was otherwise this Campaign; For the Czar, Peter Alexowitz, in whom the whole Administra∣tion of that Government was now lodged, marched in Per∣son, at the Head of a most numerous Army, and laid Siege to Asoph, a Place of great Importance, and considerable Strength, upon the River Tanais; which he carried on with
great Vigour, and which Place the Tartars, who knew the Consequences of it, were very desirous to relieve. Of this the Muscovites were aware, and therefore they ordered nine Gallies, and some other Vessels, by way of Prevention, to lie before the Mouth of the Tanais: But the Water being too shallow for the Gallies to stir, the Czar no sooner understood that the Turkish Vessels were in sight, but he immediately put 2000 Men on board the light Barks, who presently met the Turkish Convoy, and fell upon them with so much Cou∣rage and Resolution, that of three Vessels, one was sunk, and the other two betook themselves to Flight. Ten large Saiquies, which were about to make their Escape in the same manner, were cast upon the Sands by contrary Winds; and, after a faint Resistance, were master'd by the Musco∣vites; the Turks endeavouring to save themselves, some by Swimming, and others in their Shallops. To this Success of the Muscovites, if you add the Booty, it makes the thing yet the more considerable; for they found in the Saiques all the Provisions designed for Asoph, Clothes for the whole Garrison, a vast Quantity of Powder, and a great Number of Pikes and Swords, together with a considerable Quantity of Silk and Silver Stuffs: So that every Soldier of the 2000 had, for his Share, 6 Piasters; the rest being divided among the Officers and other Soldiers, the Czar reserving only the Cannon and Ammunition to himself. This being happily effected, the Siege of Asoph was carried on with great Ap∣plication, which all the Endeavours of the Turks and Tartars could not relieve by Land, they being routed in the At∣tempt, and a great many of their Number slain: So that it was surrender'd to the Czar, upon Articles, on the 28th of July; in pursuance of which, the Garrison, consisting of 3000 Men, besides Tartars, marched out, with their Arms and Baggage; and presently the Muscovites marched in, and found 90 Pieces of Cannon, together with a great Quantity of Ammunition, in the Town; But want of Provisions hasten'd the Surrender of it. The News hereof no sooner arrived at Constantinople, but it occasioned a great Consternation there; and more especially, for fear of losing those Supplies of Pro∣visions which usually come to that City by the Euxine Sea; which the Loss of that Place opened a Gap for the Moscovites to be Masters of. But now, after so long a Peregrination, 'tis time we should return homewards, and take notice, That the State of Af∣fairs in Flanders this Year being already given an Account of, it gave the King an Opportunity of returning to England somewhat sooner than usual, and the Parliament to meet a∣bout the middle of Octob. to whom his Majesty said, That he thought it our Happiness, considering the Disappointments in the
Funds, and other Difficulties we laboured under, that Things had passed without any Disadvantage; That this was a convincing Proof of the good Disposition of his Army,The Sub∣stance of the King his Speech to the Parlia∣ment. and steady Affections of his People; That the Enemy's Hopes had been hitherto fru∣strated, in respect to the difficult Conjuncture we were in; and that their unanimous Proceedings was the Way to have the same continued; That the Business before them was very great, and our Occasions pressing; That he could not let slip the Occasion, to tell them, That some Overtures had been made towards setting up a Negotiation of a General Peace: But that the best Way to Treat, was, with our Swords in our Hands, and by shewing our selves prepared to make a vigorous and effectual War. Wherefore he re∣commended earnestly to the Commons, to take Care for Raising the necessary Supplies with Speed: As he did also the Remedying of some Inconveniences still remaining, in Relation to the State of the Coin. And so he concluded, as we shall also conclude the Year, with leaving the Parliament to take care in the first place of this last Clause of his Majesty's Speech, about the Coin; and to make a strict Enquiry, among other Things, into the late Conspiracy, which took them up much Time: And of which, but very briefly, before we hasten to give an Account of the General Peace. Yet we will observe first, as we were wont to do, That this Year proved fatal to Mary Anne of Austria,The death of the Qu. Mother of Spain. Queen-Mother of Spain; who departed this Life on the 17th of May, after she had been long tormented with a Cancer in her Breast: Her Death being no less considerable a Loss to the Confederacy in general, than to Spain in particular, considering her great Influence over the Spanish Counsels, to make them take such Resolutions as were conformable to the Interests of the Common Cause. For which Reason, she was but little beloved in France; and gave Occasion for a great Prince of that Nation (as was reported) to say, when he heard of the dangerous Distemper, which had seized that Princess, That he could have wished, she had died Ten Years ago. Tho' this Year produced a General Peace between the Al∣lies and the French Monarch, yet our Parliament, before the Close of the last, in pursuance to his Majesty's Pre-mo∣nition to them,The Parlia∣ments Pro∣ceedings in his Speech at the first Opening of the Ses∣sion, proceeded vigorously to other Methods for carrying on the War: But they had not been long sate, when they met with a considerable Interruption therein, by the Business of Sir John Fenwicke, who was one of the Conspirators in the late Plot, for invading the Land and taking away the King's Life; and was designed to have been tried at the Common Law, as the rest had been; But there were some Accidents
fell out which made his Case extraordinary, and brought it into Parliament; of which take this short Account. Upon Sir John Fenwicke's Apprehension, which was in Kent, as he designed to have made his Escape that way be∣yond Sea, it did appear by a Letter of his writ to his Lady thereupon, and which hapned to come in the Governments Hands; That he was so far sensible of his Guilt and Dan∣ger, that he proposed no other way for the present to Es∣cape, than by either getting a Jury Pack'd that would be Obstinate, and not bring him in Guilty, or making Friends to the King for a Pardon or Reprieve, at least to gain Time. But after his being brought to Town, Commitment to New∣gate, and farther Consulting with his Friends, the said Me∣thods being found not very Practicable, there was another Topick resolved upon, which had a much more appa∣rent Prospect of Success; and that was, to set up a Counter∣plot, by accusing a great many of the King's best and great∣est Friends to have been guilty of Conspiring against him, which startled a great many People at first, not knowing who and who was together: And tho' the same, in the dilatory Managements of it, did for a time with Sir John, to gain him Space to have his Tryal put off; yet he could not be but sen∣sible it would not do always, and therefore there was ano∣ther Game for him to Play before he could conceive himself out of Danger; which was, to seduce away one at least of the Evidences that had swore the Treason against him, as well knowing, according to the late Act, one was not suffi∣cient in Cases of High Treason: And this being also effected in the Person of Cardell Goodman, who privately withdrew into France, the Danger seemed now to be quite over, tho' they could have been glad, both for his and others sake, that Captain Porter also had been got to the same or a worse Place; and made Overtures to him by a rascally Irish-man, one Clancy by Name, to that end. But he proved stanch against the great Temptation, and made a Discovery there∣of unto the Government: So that the Government thereby finding it self horribly abused by these Clandestine Proceed∣ings, and no room left to bring the Criminal, by the ordi∣nary Course of Law, to a Condign Punishment; The King thought fit to give leave to Admiral Rassell to acquaint the House of Commons, and lay before them the several Pa∣pers which were given in by Sir John Fenwicke, in the Na∣ture of Informations, against himself and several Persons of Quality, and desired that the same might be read, that so he might have an Opportunity to justifie himself; or if he did not, to fall under the Censure of the House. The Pa∣pers being read, Sir John was immediately ordered to be brought before them; and being interrogated, by the Spea∣ker,
concerning his Inclinations to make a Discovery of the Designs and Practises of the Enemies of the Government, with a Promise of Favour, if he were Ingenious therein; yet finding by all the Answers he made, he did nothing but Pre∣varicate with the House, alledging the King knew already what he had discovered; and that he could not be safe to tell them any thing without assurance of Security for him∣self: They ordered a Bill to be brought in to Attaint him of High Treason, which was carried by a great Majority in the House; and Mr. Speaker acquainting them that he had received a Letter from Sir John Fenwicke, importing, That having received a Copy of the Bill with the House's Order thereupon, he desired such Counsel and Sollicitor, as he therein named, might be allowed him. The same was rea∣dily agreed to, tho' it was said the Sollicitor was a very great Jacobite; and insinuated farther, that he was suspect∣ed to have been concerned in Goodman's Escape. The first debate that hapned upon Sir John's being brought to the Bar of the House, was concerning the Mace, whether it should lie on the Table while he was in the House, or whether the Sergeant ought to stand by him with it at the Bar, which last was carried; and then the Bill was read by the Clerk of the Parliament in these Words: WHereas, Sir John Fenwicke, Bar was upon the Oaths of George Porter, Esq and Cardell Goodman, Gent. at the Sessions of Oyer and Terminer held for the City of London, on the 28th day of May, 1696. Indicted of High Treason, in Compas∣sing and Imagining the Death and Destruction of His Majesty, and adhering to His Majesty's Enemies, by Consulting and Agree∣ing with several Persons (whereof some have been already At∣tainted, and others not yet brought to their Tryals for the said Treason) at several Meetings to send Robert Charnock, since Attainted and Executed for High Treason in Conspiring to As∣sassinate His Majesty's Sacred Person (whom God long preserve) to the late King James in France, to cite and Incourage the French King to Invade this Kingdom with an Armed Force, by Promising to Join with and Assist him with Men and Arms up∣on such an Invasion. And whereas, the said Sir John Fenwicke did obtain His Majesty's Favour to have his Tryal delayed from time to time, upon his repeated Promises of making an ingenuous and full Confession of his Knowledge of any Design or Conspi∣racy against His Majesty's Person or Government, and of the Persons therein concerned: And whereas, he has so far abused His Majesty's great Clemency and Indulgence therein, That in∣stead of making such Confession he hath contrived and framed False and Scandalous Papers as his Informations, reflecting on the Fidelity of several Noble Peers, divers Members of the House
of Commons, and others, only by Hearsay; and contriving there∣by to Vndermine the Government, and create Jealousies between the King and his Subjects, and to stifle the real Conspiracy. And whereas, Cardell Goodman, one of the Witnesses against the said Sir John Fenwicke, to Prove the said Treason, lately and since the several times appointed for the Tryal of the said Sir John Fenwicke, at one of which times the said Sir John Fenwicke had been accordingly Tryed, had it not been for the Expectation of the said Discoveries so often promised by him, is withdrawn; so that the said Cardell Goodman cannot be had, to give Evi∣dence upon any Tryal. Be it Enacted by the King's most Excel∣lent Majesty by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament Assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said Sir John Fenwicke be and is hereby Convicted and Attainted of High Treason, and shall suffer the Pains of Death, and in all Forfeiture as a Person Attainted of High Treason. The Bill being read, the King's Counsel, Sergeant Goul and Sergeant Lovell, according to Mr. Speaker's Direction, very learnedly, especially the former, opened the Evidence they had to prove the Suggestions of it, and were as learn∣edly answered by Sir Thomas Powis, and Sir Bartholome Shoar, the Prisoner's Counsel, who alledged, That if the o∣ther would only call in Evidence to prove the Suggestions of the Bill, they were ready to answer them; but if they called in Evidence to prove Sir John Fenwicke Guilty of the Conspiracy, by living Witnesses, they took upon them not to be ready for that; saying, They did not know they should be allowed liberty to produce any Witnesses: Whereupon they were ordered all to withdraw, and the House debated the same a long time, not without some Members making large Excursions from the Matter in dispute; and after much Contestation, as of other things, of the proposing of the Question it self; at length Mr. Speaker put it thus, That the Council, in managing of Evidence against Sir John Fen∣wicke, be allowed to produce Evidence touching the Alle∣gations of the Bill, and the Treasons for which he was In∣dicted, which was carried in the Affermative; and the House, it being late, Adjourned to Monday the 16th of when the House proceeded farther upon it, and the Coun∣cil produced their Evidence, which was Captain Porter, gave a full Account of what he knew concerning Sir Jo Fenwicke's Guilt; and was farther examined, notwithstand∣ing the Prisoner's Council stifly opposed it, concerning being tampered with by one Clancy, as to the taking off Testimony, as to the late Conspiracy; And not only so, the King's Council produced the Record of Clancy's Con∣viction
thereupon; and so proceeded to Goodman's Exami∣nation taken under the Hand of Mr. Vernon, which they prayed might be read, but the Prisoner's Council opposed it as a thing unallowable and impracticable, the Law re∣quiring Persons to appear and give their Evidence, viva voce, &c. and the House entred into an hot Debate upon it; But at length it was carried, the said Imformation should be read, and next that some of Grand Jury should give an account upon what Evidence they found the Bill of Indict∣ment that was thereupon brought in against Sir John Fen∣wicke. From hence they proceeded to the Record of the Convi∣ction of Mr. Cook; and when the Council on both sides had spoke to it, and the House debated the same, it was more∣over agreed, That the said Record should be read, and the King's Council allowed to examine Witnesses as to what Goodman swore at the Tryal of Cook; which being over, and some Questions asked concerning the forementioned Letter of Sir John Fenwicke, it was agreed, the Prisoner's Coun∣cil, if they had any Witnesses to examine on his Behalf, might do it that Night; but that as to their Observations, the House would give them time till next Morning: This they, having none except a Record to produce, accepted of, and indeed said as much in Behalf of their Client as could have been expected; wherein, however, they were as nota∣bly answered by Mr. Sergeant Gould, but I have not room to Cite the Arguments: And so I proceed to shew that Sir John and the Council being ordered to withdraw, and upon the Motion of some of the more aggrieved Members, that the Prisoner should deal clearly and candidly with the House, in giving an account of what he knew concerning several Persons of great Quality, against whom he had given in the Informations formerly mentioned, and he declining of the same, it was resolved Mr. Vernon should give in his Evi∣dence in respect to Sir John's getting his Tryal delayed by Offers of Information, and that in his and the Counsels pre∣sence on both sides: And the Counsel having no more to say, they were discharged from their farther Attandance at that time, and the Order of the Day for reading of the Bill a second time being read by the Clerk, and the same being afterwards opened by the Speaker, and having ex∣pected for some time, and no member rising up to speak, he asked whether he should put the Question of Commit∣ment: But then the Speaker had his Belly full on't, and the Debate ran very high both on the one side and the o∣ther, about the extraordinary Method of Proceedings, the Power and Justice of Parliaments, compared with other in∣feriour Courts of Judicature, with many Presidents of for∣mer
Bills of Attainder, Pro and Con; and other Arguments that fell in, which are too tedious for me particularly to en∣ter upon. But upon the whole, towards Eleven at Night, the Result was, That the Bill should be Committed, and on Friday the 20th, the House resolved it self into a Committee of the whole House upon the said Bill, and several Words having been offered as an Amendment to it, importing Sir John Fenwicke's being Guilty, at last these Words [of which the said Sir John Fenwicke is Guilty] were agreed on to be added to the Close thereof. November the 25th, the Bill was read the third time, when the Contestation upon the Debate run as hot as ever, and the Members were no less divided in their Opinions than before; but at length the Question for Passing the Bill being put, the House divided thereupon, when there appearing for it an Hundred Eighty Nine, and but an Hundred and Fifty Six against it, it passed in the Affirmative. It's observable, that tho' the Crime wherewith Sir John Fenwicke was Charged, was of the highest Nature that could be against the Go∣vernment; yet that very many most honourable and wor∣thy Persons in both Houses, and such as are well known to be his Majesty's best Friends, were very stiff against the Bill. Yet that did not arise from any Intentions in them to Acquit the Guilty, but they could not be satisfied with the manner of procedure, and that of there being but one vivi voce Witness only, stuck hard upon them; especially, since in all ordinary Courts, two were always required for the Proof of such a Crime; and that there had been an Act made but the very Sessions before, that did possitively re∣quire the same in Cases of High Treason: And it was looked upon very strange by some, that such a President should be so quickly made, and that in such a good Reign; and the same might prove of very dangerous Consequence to the Li∣berty of the Subject in future. Times, which they should be always very regardful of: But however the Matter were, Sir John was Beheaded for it, and none of them thought him unjustly to suffer, though many boggled at the manner of his Condemnation. At the Place of Execution he deliver'd the following Paper to the Sheriffs.
A true Copy of the Paper Delivered by Sir John Fenwicke, Baronet, to the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, on Tower-Hill, the Place of Execution, on Thursday January the 28th, 1697. SPeaking nor Writing was never my Talent. I shall therefore give a very Short, but Faithful Account, first, of my Religion; and next, what I suffer most innocently for, to avoid the Calumnies I may reasonably expect my Enemies will cast upon me when dead, since they have most falsely and maliciously aspersed me whilst under my Misfor∣tunes. As for my Religion, I was brought up in the Church of England, as it is establish'd by Law, and have ever profess'd it; tho' I confess I have been an unworthy Member of it, in not living up to the strict and excellent Rules thereof, for which I take Shame to my self, and humbly ask For∣giveness of GOD. I come now to dye in that Commu∣nion, trusting, as an humble and hearty Penitent, to be received by the Mercy of God, through the Merits of Jesus Christ my Saviour. My Religion taught me my Loyalty, which, I bless God, is untainted: And I have ever endeavoured, in the Station wherein I have been placed, to the utmost of my Power, to support the Crown of England in the True and Lineal Course of Descent, without interruption. As for what I am now to dye; I call God to witness, I went not to that Meeting in Leadenhall-street with any such intention, as to invite King James by Force to invade this Nation; nor was I my self provided with either Horse or Arms, or engaged for any number of Men, or gave par∣ticular Consent foy any such Invasion, as is most falsely Sworn against me. I do also declare, in the Presence of God, That I knew nothing of King James's coming to Calais, nor of any Inva∣sion intended from thence, till it was publickly known: And the only Notion I had that something might be attempted, was from the Thoulon Fleet coming to Brest. I also call God to witness, that I received the knowledge of what is contained in those Papers that I gave to a great Man that came to me in the Tower, both from Letters and Messages that came from France; and he told me, when I ead them to him, That the Prince of Orange had been ac∣uainted with most of those things before.
I might have expected Mercy from that Prince, because I was Instrumental in saving his Life. For when about April, 95. an Attempt formed against him, came to my Know∣ledge, I did, partly by Dissuasions, and partly by Delays, prevent that Design; which I suppose was the Reason that the last Villanous Project was concealed from me. If there be any Persons whom I have injur'd in Word o Deed, I heartily pray their Pardon, and beg of God to Par∣don those who have injured me; particularly those who with great Zeal have sought my Life, and brought the guilt of my Innocent Blood upon this Nation, no Treason being proved upon me. I return my most hearty Thanks to those Noble and Wor∣thy Persons who gave me their Assistance by opposing this Bill of Attainder, without which, it had been impossible I could have fallen under the Sentence of Death. God bless them and their Posterity; though I am fully satisfied they Pleaded their own Cause while they Defended mine. I pray God to bless my True and Lawful Sovereign King James, the Queen, and Prince of Wales, and Restore him and his Posterity to this Throne again, for the Peace and Pro∣sperity of this Nation, which is impossible to prosper till the Government is settled upon a right Foot. And now, O God, I do with all Humble Devotion Comm my Soul into thy Hands, the great Maker and Preserver of Me, and Lover of Souls, beseeching thee, That it may be always and precious in thy Sight, through the Merits of my Saviour Jesus Christ, Amen. J. FENWICK. But to leave this ungrateful Subject, the Parliament be∣sides the passing of the usual Land-Tax, made an Act o Granting to His Majesty several Duties upon Parchment, Pap and Vellum, to encourage the Bringing of Plate and Hammer' Mony into the Mint, to be Coined: As there was also another Act, To encourage the Bringing in of Wrought Plate to be Coine. There was also Divers Impositions upon Goods and Merchandiz continued: The Deficiencies of Funds made good: The Cap Stock of the Bank of England enlarged: And, For Raising the Publick Credit. Besides which, there were Impositions laid up∣on Leather and Malt; A farther Subsidy of Tonnage and Poun∣age granted; and, an Act made For Licensing Hawkers Pediars. But before these Things were compleated in England, the Preliminaries of the Peace were agreed on in Holland, and signed the 10th of February: And they are these that folow:
I. THE French King doth consent and agree, that the Trea∣ties of Westphalia and Nimeguen shall be the Basis and Foundation of the Negotiation of the General Peace to be made with all the Allies.The Preli∣minary Ar∣ticles. II. That the City of Strasburgh be restored to the Empire, in the State it was when taken by His Majesty. III. That the City of Luxemburgh shall be restored to the King of Spain, in the Condition it is now. But here you are to observe, that France made an Offer to the Allies, by way of Equivalent for the said Cities. IV. The Towns of Mons and Charleroy shall be given up in the Condition they are at present. V. That those Places in Catalonia which are in the French King's Hands, and which he hath taken since the Peace of Nime∣guen, shall be restored in the same State as they were taken. VI. That the Town and Castle of Dinant shall be given up to the Bishop and Prince of Liege, in the State they were taken. VII. That all the Re-unions which have been made since the Treaty of Nimeguen, shall be void. VIII. Lorrain shall be restored, according to the Conditions of the said Treaty. But here it was agreed, That in case the Concessions made in respect to Lorrain did not please, this Article should be referred to the General Treaty; with Promises that greater Offers should then be made, and that it should be the first Point treated on in the Negotiation. It was also farther agreed, That upon the Conclusion of the Peace, the Most Christian King should acknowledge the Prince of Orange for King of Great Britain, without any manner of Diffi∣culty, Restriction, Condition, or Reserve. That as for other Princes, whether in the Confederacy, or not, their Pretensions should be reserved to the General Negotiation, un∣der the Mediation of the King of Sweden. IX. The Dutchy of Duux-Ponts to be restored to the King of Sweden, with all its Dependancies. X. Philipsburgh to be restored to the Bishop of Spire. XI. The Fort of Kehl, and other Fortifications made on the Rhine, to be rased. XII. As also, Fort Louis, and Hunninghen. XIII. That Trarbach and Mont-Royal should be given up, but first dismantled, upon Condition they should never be fortified again. XIV. The French King agreed to give up to the Elector Pa∣latin not only all the Electorate, but also the Dutchies of Simme∣ren and Lauthern, with the Earldom of Shanheim; as also all other Places whereof he had been dispossessed, to this present Time.
XV. That Madam, the Dutchess of Orleans, was to do nothing upon Account of her Pretensions, Via Facti; but might bring her Action according to the Law, in relation to the Electors. XVI. That the Castle and County of Veldens be restored to their lawful Owner. XVII. Bisweiler, to the Count of Hanau. XVIII. The Seigniories of March, Marmosy and Dagstein, and the Counties of Louningue and Dagsbourgh, should be de∣livered up to the Count of Overstein. XIX. That the Seigniories of Salms and Valkenstein should be given up to the Prince of Salms, or to their Proprietors, seeing that the same is still in question. XX. The Seigniories of Latzensteim and Altheim, to their Proprietors. XXI. Otweiler, to the House of Nassau. XXII. That the City and County of Mompelgard, Harcourt, Blainont and Chatelette should be put into the Possession of the House of Wirtemburgh. XXIII. That Germersheim should be also given up to the Ele∣ctor Palatin, notwithstanding any former Treaties to the con∣trary. XXIV. That Stadeck and Landsbergue be given to the Count of Veldentz. XXV. That the Principality of Orange be given up to its So∣vereign. But for all this, some of the Ministers of the Allies, after having consulted their Masters hereupon, Declared, That as to what concerned the first Article, they fully agreed to it; But for Strasburg, they further insisted it should be re∣stored, with its Fortifications and Dependances, and that no equivalent should be accepted for it. They accepted of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Articles, only they insisted, that not only the City, but the County of Luxemburg, and that of Chinay, should be given up; As they did, that the City and Castle of Dinant should be yielded together with the Dutchy of Bovillion in the same state they were. They De∣clared themselves satisfied as to the Seventh Article touching the Re-unions, but not so with the agreement made about Lorrain, which they would have restored to the Duke its So∣vereign, without any manner of restriction. In pursuance to the said Preliminaries,The Treaty at Reswick. and Reswick, as the Place of Treaty, being after many Difficulties and Scruples, fully agreed to, by all parties concerned; The Conferences began about the 9th of May, and were not carried on to any considerable length, before there was a work of another Na∣ture done in the Field; Where the French, as having made a Peace with Savoy, as we have told you last Year, and as
being their last Effort, were very powerful this Year, espe∣cially, in Flanders and Catalonia, In the first whereof they had still the advantage over the Confederates,Aeth taken by the French. from the re∣moteness of the German Troops, and the slowness of their march, and who hardly came into the Camp this Year ill the French had done their work in the Reduction of Aeth, which tho' it gave some farther Reputation to their Arms and Cause; yet it came far short of the Boasts they had made all the Spring, of attacking a no less considerable place than Namur: But their grand design upon  His Ma∣jesty by his great Prudence, Courage, and Celerity utterly Disappointed, so that their intentions to become sole Masters of the Peace, and speak once more the Language of Nime∣guen, came hereby very far short of their Expectations. How∣ever, neither this nor the Siege of Barcelon was designed by them to retard, but rather to quicken the Spaniards pace towards a Peace; So that the Conferences between their Ple∣nipotentiaries and the Allies, went on under the Mediation of the Young King of Sweden, now his Father Charles XI. of that Name had died on the 17th of April this Spring, by the intervention of the Baron de Lillieroot his Ambassador, who went between the one and the other for the said purpose. After the Allies had made their Pretensions, they drew up a large Deduction, in justification of them, of which they resolved to give the French Plenipotentiaries no Copy, until they had Declared, that they had received the King's Or∣ders, to make theirs. But these same Plenipotentiaries, having Declared, that they had nothing to ask or pretend to, and that they were ready to Answer the others. The Allies changed their Thoughts, the French Plenipotentiaries having in the mean time had several separate Conferences with those of the States General, about Commerce, and a Cessation of Arms, which the former shewed themselves very eager for; But there was but little appearance, that this last point should then have been agreed to, seeing the Peace was more likely to be Retarded than Advanced thereby. Towards the end of May,The Spanish Abassa rpresent thir . the Spanish Ambassadors pre∣sented their grievances to the Mediator, who received them with a promise of having the same shortly Debated; But the said Mediator did at the same time Declare, that he was of Opinion, that it would very much contribute to the advance∣ment of the Peace, if a Truce was agreed on by common consent, seeing the Clamour and Fury of War did more harm than good to the Negotiation; Mens minds being so much he less composed, by how much they were Distracted and out of order by the daily ven of War. This Opini∣on seemed then to be approved by silence, but other things
intervened, and none of all the Allies made so much ado about having all the Names of the Confederate Princes, exprest and particularly inserted in the Treaty, as the Brandenburg Ambassador, who insisted very much upon it, as some of the Allies took it also very ill, that both the one and the other pretentions of the Empire, were proposed by the Emperor's Ambassador only in his Name; but they had satisfaction given them in respect to these complaints, for the said Ambassador replied, that every one of the Allies was free to propose se∣parate Articles concerning his own Affairs. Several Princes did about the same time give in their Grievances to the Me∣diator, while all Parties were in mighty Expectations o News from divers parts that might favour their respective interests, but more especially from Poland, where the Fren were Cocksure the Prince of Conti would carry that Crown, whereas the Confederates had apparently all their Eyes turn'd upon Prince James, but there was a third Person who ran away with the Bone in Contention,The Elector of Saxony chosen King of Poland. whom no body eve Dreamt to have any thoughts that way; and that was the Elector of Saxony, who in the end of the Spring, took a Jour∣ney to Vienna, under pretence of settling matters in Relati to the Campaign in Hungary, where 'twas given out he would Command the Emperor's Army again this Year: But the Event proved, that in reality, the Design was to Concer with the Emperor how the Elector might obtain the Crow of Poland, which his Religion could be no bar to, since e was already privately reconciled to the Church of Rome, at least given out so afterwards. But whether in order the wearing of a Crown, the Elector has obtained as m Reputation and Glory by the Abjuration (as the Gentleme of the Church of Rome are pleased to phrase it) of the Pro¦stant Religion, as his great Ancestor did in the Propagation of that Faith, Preached by Martin Luther, and the first Pri in Europe that avowedly (tho' it was with the hazzard of a took both him and it under his Protection, I'le leave othe to Judge. However it be, the Design was certainly carried on with wonderful secrety and address; for all of a sudd the Elector leaves Vienna, which was attended with vario Reports spread abroad immediately, of some mis-understan¦ing between the Emperor and Him, which no body co¦assign a cause for: But when they saw the Elector muste a Body of his Troops, it wrought I know not what suspitio and the Brandenburgers so far took the Allarm, as suddenly get what Froces they could together, to oppose any atte that might be made that way: But the Electors sudden ma towards Silesia, and the Frontiers of Poland, quickly oc¦oned other Speculations, and in Truth, the next News th had at Reswick, was his being chosen on the 26th of
King of Poland, by a great majority of Voices, above the Prince of Conti, who was also Proclaimed King, though the Expedition afterwards made into that Country by that brave Man, proved little to his or the French King's satisfaction, the Elector having in a manner weathered all his point be∣fore the other's Arrival. The first news of it was a great mortification to the French Plenipotentiaries at Reswick; how∣ever the Treaty went on▪ and the Ceremonial part, being in a manner all adjusted, the French, who had daily Confe∣rences with the Ministers of the States General, and of the other Allies, made an offer of an Equivalent again, for Lux∣emburg and Strasburg, they being willing for the former to give up to his Catholick Majesty, Conde, Tournay, Melen and Ipres, as they were for the other ready to consign into the Emperor's hands, Brisac, Phillipsburg and Friburg. But the French Plenipotentiaries had in the mean time sent the Pre∣tensions of the Allies to their King, while the Confederates protested, That they would not be put by their right, but that they should have liberty allowed them, every one to present his Grievance to the Mediator: The Princes of the Empire desiring also to e comprehended in the Treaty demanded the same things, whereof neither the Imperialists nor the French made any great difficulty, whether they were willing to have all their diffe∣rent Interests, and concerns terminated together, or every one of them by themselves in particular. About this time it was,Alterations about the Basis of the present Tre∣aty. the Plenipotentiaries of the States General, Declared aloud with some sort of Indignation, That it was an unjust and false Report that was spread abroad, con∣cerning their Masters having underhand concluded upon their Affairs with France: And that they might still make a great∣er appearance of their just Comportment and Sincerity; they openly diswaded the Ministers of the Allies from consenting to a Truce with France, to which they were of themselves deaf enough, and the rather, for that the French had rejected the Pretentions of the Imperialists and Spaniards, as being not willing to answer the same, before the Confederates gave their Opinions concerning the Propositions France had made, which were; That the Plenipotentiaries of the Allies should treat upon the Foundation proposed on the 10th of Febr. last, and advance no other Points save those whereof there had been mention made before, to the end there might be a Ba∣sis and Foundation made for a Treaty; the which Proposals being not yet agreed upon (seeing the French gave out, the Neutrality in Catalonia was concluded on) the Imperialists did afterwards make answer, That these Propositions were but preliminary ones and not absolute, and that they were allow∣ed of, but upon this Condition; that in case any one point were found to be imperfect or faulty, the same ought to
be amended by the succeeding Treaties. To this was also added, That they were very desirous to know the answer of the French, as to every particular point proposed by the Emperor and his Allies. These Articles were allowed of, but not to be inserted in the first project of the Emperors Plenipotentiaries, and the same was admitted at the im∣portunity of the States Ambassadors, as being some what more particularly relating to their Interest, and that of England. But the Spaniards were of Opinion, the ought to keep close to the points that had been once agreed on, and that to do otherwise, would but retard the Negotiation: And seeing that the first preliminary point agreed on, did import, that the Treaties of Westphalia and Nimeguen, should be the Ba∣sis and Foundation of this Negotiation, according to the ex∣press consent of the French King; It was consequently very evident, that those Preliminary Positions, could not be the foundation of all pretensions that the Allies could have up∣on France: But on the other hand, if the preceding Treaties had no Effect at all, it was then in vain that they had made choise of a place to confer in; That the French had better have staid in Paris, and that it was to no purpose that Pasports had been granted, and the assistance and mediation of the King of Sweden desired; That the Imperialists were amazed, that so unnecessary a Difficulty should have been raised, in so clear and evident a thing, to which was also added; That they did not doubt, but that the Mediator and the States, were of the same Opinion, that same point having been long enough Debated in the Preliminaries, and terminated in a general and unanimons Consent. This was no sooner over, but that the French dispatched a Courier to their Master, on whose part there were Proposals made again concerning a Truce, and a free Trade, as being the first step towards a Peace. But these things came to nothing, so that the French Embassadors, now replying to those Answers made by the Imperialists and Spaniards said; that they were so strictly li∣mitted to their Instructions, that they durst not any manner of way exceed or change any thing from the Treaty of Nime∣guen, as the Basis proposed unto them by their King, and that consequently it was in vain for the Allies to require any thing beyond the Articles of the said Treaty, seeing their King would grant them no power for it; with which De∣claration of theirs, the Allies were so far from being satisfied, that they gave them to understand by the Mediator, that their answer was frivolous, and had no other tendency in it, than to break off the Treaty, or at least to protract it: This their Declaration being directly contrary, to what had been fully regulated, and absolutely agreed on in the Prelimina∣ies; and the Mediator himself being of the same Sentiments,
he did thereupon lay the full Pretentions of the Allies be∣fore the French Plenipotentiaries, who made him answer, That the retarding of the Negotiation, should with much Reason be attributed to the Allies, the last Instrument that had been presented on the Emperor's part, being conceived in such Articles, which they foresaw France neither could, nor ought to accept. Besides this, they said, the Spani∣ards thought it more convenient, to take the Pyrenaean Trea∣ty for the Basis of this, which proposition, said they, was the cause that made the French insist upon that of Ni∣meguen. To this the Mediator replied, That he could not believe that the French King was offended, That all and singular the Allies had joined together in the last An∣swer, as in an Affair that was common to them all; That they were of Opinion, France would have declared the same thing, were she in the same Condition Spain found her self in, to wit, that the Peace of the Pyrenaees should be renew∣ed in its full force. The Allies also offered it as their Opi∣nion, that for the avoiding of all these Difficulties and Disputes, they thought it would be better the French should answer each of their Propositions a-part, which was at length agreed unto. The Imperialists, in pursuance to this Resolution, present∣ed to the Mediator, a Project of the Method to be used of Treating by Word of Mouth, without any difficulty, which being read first to the Confederates, and a Copy of the said being afterwards delivered unto them, before it was shewed to the French Plenipotentiaries; but that same Copy being some-what delayed, the other discontented Allies took an una∣nimous Resolution, to Remonstrate to the Imperialists, that themselves had also a share in the Alliance, and consequent∣ly, they ought to have Deliberated with them concerning the Points proposed, as well on the Emperor's part, as on that of France: Yet things could not be brought so to bear, but the Embassage of the Empire agreed on at Ratisbonne, was frustrated of the Effect of its Vote. About the same time, the Mediator at the Request of the Imperialists, pro∣posed to the French Plenipotentiaries the making choice of some other Days, besides the ordinary Ones, to hold their Conferences on, in order to hasten the finishing of the Ne∣gotiation. But the latter, supposing the Allies had some par∣ticular End in the same Proposal, made answer, They were not at Liberty to Comply with this Request, but that they were always ready to Appear at the Appointed Times. The last Instruments presented by the Imperialists, were not pleasing to divers of the Allies, who affirmed, they had just Complaints to make, in order to Redress. The Ele∣ctor of Hanover's Plenipotentiary insisting, he ought to have
a place in the Assembly, as an Electoral Minister, occasioned also some Dispute, but the same being left to the Decision of the Mediator, he gave it in favour of him. Soon after, the Imperialists, and the French, gave in respectively their Projects of Peace; but all the Articles of the French, being drawn word for word from the Treaty of Nimeguen, the same were rejected by the Allies, as being too opposite to the Interests of the Empire, with which, they could never Acquiesce, as also because there was often mention made not only of the Allies of the Empire, but also of those of France: It being notoriously known they had no such in the War, unless the Turks were meant by it; wherefore it was insisted upon, that the French should more fully Explain themselves, and give in a clearer Project: For they would not allow of Mental Reservations, nor obscure, or equivocal Terms. But for all this, the French in the be∣ginning of July, required the Mediator to Exhort the Allies, to admit of no delay, and apply themselves effectually to the Terminating of this tedious Work. To whom the Mediator made answer, That he did not see how the Allies Retarded the removing of those Points that were undecided, but that it behoved the French, to look to that, for all their Com∣plaints; and added further, that the Allies had for a long time declared the sincere Intentions they had towards it, but that the French had not done answerable thereto; and that they had sent those Points to Paris, in order to Consult the King thereupon. That the sincere Intention of the Allies, was manifested, from their having desired other Extraordi∣nary Days should be appointed to hold their Conferences, which the French, on their part, had declined; That the Al∣lies were not ignorant therein of the Designs of the French Court, who had nothing in view, save the Peace of Nime∣guen, and if that failed, endeavoured to delay things till such time as the Allies had found out a Mean that was not altoge∣ther contrary to the said Treaty, tho' there might be some accidental Differences in it. As soon as the Mediator had given an account of all this to the Allies, they resolved to Confer with one another Daily, in order to find out a way, to shorten their Business; and in the first Conference, it was concluded, the French should answer to every Point in Diffe∣rence, as proposed by the Allies, which, when the other came to know, they desired to be informed according to what manner the Allies were willing to decide the first Point, to the end that having once seen the beginning of the Treaty, they might be able to Conjecture whether they had Power enough to Treat, and Conclude without any further Order▪ from their King. But the French at the next Meeting had still somewhat of the old haunt, and insisted, that in order
to add a greater Weight to the Business, nothing was more likely to do it, than to Treat according to the Peace of Ni∣meguen, and to change some Articles therein, according to the desire of the Allies. But the Mediator, at the Request of the Allies, reply'd, That they were not to Treat alone, ac∣cording to the Treaty of Nimeguen, but also according to that of Westphalia, as being them two together that had been reciprocally Proposed, and Accepted of in the Preliminaries, as the Basis of this Negotiation, and that consequently, the Allies required that the French should Form a Project ac∣cording to those two Treaties, to the which the Imperialists would promise a quick Answer: The Answer of the French, was, that this requir'd time to deliberate upon it, which, while they were doing, the Imperial Embassadors promised to those of the Electors, that they would soon Communi∣cate to them all the Articles they should put forwards, to the end all Differences between them might be removed. The French, after divers Consultations, declared, They had not sufficient Power to answer to the different Proposals of the Imperialists, but that they would give in a Project to the Spaniards, if they would accept of it, which the Media∣tor acquainted the Allies with, as also, that the French said, they had no other Power to Treat than according to the Treaty of Nimeguen. But the Allies astonish'd thereat, came in a particular Conference to an unanimous Resolution, ne∣ver to consent to it; the same Treaty being contrary to the Interests of almost all the Allies. And tho' they would not entirely Reject the said Treaty, yet they had rather that a Project should be Formed according to it, and that of West∣phalia.Other Al∣tercations a∣bout the Bsis of the present Treaty. In the mean time, the Electoral Ministers could not well digest this Proposal of the Imperialists, that in Digni∣ties, and Cessions, there should be no regard had to any other, save the Embassadors of the highest Characters, for they insisted, that they ought to be Treated with, upon an equal Foot with the rest: Hereupon the French declared, they would use the Elector's Embassadors in the same man∣ner as the Emperor's Plenipotentiaries did, and that they would Honour the rest in all Publick Acts, in such a manner as should give no occasion of Complaint. But to the main of the Treaty; the Spaniards did at last consent that the French should give in their Project, to which they would make an Answer, which they were brought to do, upon an Assurance from the Mediator, that the same should be made up of the Treaty of Westphalia, and Nimeguen▪ But the Me∣diator at the same time, put the French in mind, that they ought to propose their Articles in such a manner, as to leave no Repugnancy between them and the Plenipotentaries; and to be regulated according to those two Treaties; upon
Default whereof, there would be no Advance made therein. And now it was given out at least, and I believe there was something in it, that the King of Sweden and Denmark had both declared to the French, That they should be constrained to declare War against them, without they went more seriously on with the Business, and cut short all unnecessary Difficulties. And here the Mediator represented to the French Plenipoten∣tiaries, as his last Advice, (because he found them, as it were, Deaf to the last Proposal,) what he had said to them before, in relation to the Spaniards; and assured them, the others would accept of such a Project. But the French said, That they had given the Spaniards Time enough to deliberate: And for the same Reason they required the same for themselves. Upon which, the Mediator reply'd, That their Courier was al∣ready returned from Paris; and that, without him, they had sufficient Orders from their King, to treat: However, some Days elapsed before they were brought to it. In the Interim, the Elector of Brandenburgh's Minister was very ear∣nest to have the French Ambassadors to get a full Power to treat with him in particular, since his Master had formally declared War against France. And the Deputies of the Cir∣cles of Suabia and Franconia required, That Satisfaction should be made by France, to the said Circles, for the Da∣mages they had sustained during the War. But all this was to little purpose. At length, on the 20th of July, the French gave in their Project of Peace, founded upon the fore-mentioned Treaties of Westphalia and Nimeguen: It would be too tedious to give the Particulars of it in this place; but in short, the main of it, as to the Empire, was, An Offer to make void seve∣ral Re-unions made of ands on that side, by the Chamber of Metz and Bezanson, and the Sovereign Council of Brisa, since the Treaty of Nimeguen: To restore the City of Stra∣burg, or to give an Equivalent for it, of the City and Ca∣stle of Friburg, and the Town of Brisac: To demolish the Fortifications of Hunninghen, on the other side of the Rhine: o restore Lorrain to the Duke of that Name, in the same manner as it was offered in the Treaty of Nimeguen; and the City of Nancy, upon certain Conditions: With the demolishing of divers Places, such as Mont-Royal, Trarbac, &c. As for the Spaniards, they offered to give up to them the City and County of Luxemburg and the County of Chinay; or in lieu of them some other Places hereafter to be named, for which there was at present a Blank left in the Project: As to the Re-unions made, the same Tender was offered as was to the Empire: The City and Castle of inant to be delivered to the Bishop of Liegge And for all other Places taken either from the one, or the other, during the War, the same likewise were  re∣stored.
The Spaniards seemed, in the main, to have been pretty well satisfied with the French Concessions: But the Emperor's Plenipotentiaries made a long, and, as some thought, a some-what extravagant Answer to the Project; which the others did not seem to regard so much, their main Business being to make up with the rest, upon what Terms they were willing to give to them, and to save some∣what, if possible, of their great and long Acquisitions to∣wards the Rhine, since there was so little Prospect of saing any thing elsewhere. Wherefore the French King finding much Time spent to little purpose, by carrying on the Trea∣ty in Writing; and not knowing what Accidents might hap∣pen, he ordered his Plenipotentiaries to receive no Preten∣sions nor Answers from the Allies in Writing, but to treat viva voce with them. And tho' the 10th of Sept. was the ut∣most Time the French would give, to accept of their Of∣fers; yet it was observed, that they began about this time to demit some-what of their accustomed Rigour. Aug. the 16th,An Extraor∣dinary Con∣gress held. was the first Day that an extraordinary Congress was held at Reswick, which lasted almost the whole Day: And next Day the Plenipotentiaries of the Allies were together for the first time, in the great Hall of the Royal Palace. Not long after this, came the News of the Taking of Barcelona by the French, after one of the most vi∣gorous Sieges that had happen'd almost in any Age what∣ever. This made the Spaniards very uneasie, and very pres∣sing to have the Peace signed upon the Conditions offered by France; and more especially, since, by the Memorial given in to the Mediator on the first Day of Sept. there had been an Offer made of giving up this Place also to them, upon a slight Consideration of a few Villages belonging to the Ca∣stelline of Aeth to be surrender'd to the French, for the Conveniency of the Trade of the Inhabitants of Tournay. But by how much the more easie the French seemed to be with the Spaniards, they made so much the more bold with the Empire, and now insisted positively upon the Detension of Strasburg, and that the Emperor should rest contented with the Equivalent, which, they said, would be more con∣siderable to him, since he would have the entire Sovereignty of those Towns France quitted; whereas Strasburg, it re∣stored, must have been set at its own Liberty, as a Free Imperial City. And if the Empire was startled at this new Pace, they were not a whit less at the Definite Time fixed by France, for their Answer, which was the 20th of Sept.; after which time they would be no longer obliged to those Offers. And this was still the more mortifying, since they began now to be superiour in Force to the French there, and to act Offensively. And to this, that the Imperialists be∣gan
also by this time to be a a little Jealous, lest some of the Allies should sign a Separate Peace, and leave them out; and this occasioned some Heats between the Confederates, which terminated in Conferences about the Subject Matter lying before them.The Lord Portland and the Ma∣reschal de Boufflers their Inter∣view, and the Conse∣quence thereof. And tho' the Silence of the Allies con∣cerning the Treaty, did about this amaze the French Pleni∣potentiaries; yet the Interview between my Lord Portland and the Mareschal de Boufflers, at the Request of the latter, occasioned various Speculations, and was as a Dagger to the Hearts of our Jacks in England, who still, poor Fools! flattered themselves, against all common Sense and Reason, that tho' a Treaty of Peace was held at the King's own Pa∣lace, yet he must be left out of it: And if this, and the suc∣ceeding Interviews that were between those two great Fa∣vourites of their Masters, was so surprizing to most Men in general, my Lord Portland, who went from thence, to the Hague, his declaring, by the King's Order, to the Congress, That as for what concerned His Majesty and his Kingdoms, he was well satisfied that all Matters were so adjusted with France, that his Concerns would occasion no delay in the General Peace, and therefore he earnestly pressed the other Allies, and particularly the Emperor to contribute all that in them lay towards concluding so great a Work, was no less so. At last the 20th of September came,The Peace signed be∣tween Eng∣land, Spain, Holland and France. when either an hap∣py Peace, or a long and bloody War, was like to determine the Fate of Europe; when the English, Spanish, and Dutch Plenipotentiaries, after a long Conference with those of France, and having adjusted all Matters remaining in Diffe∣rence between any of them, mutually signed the Peace a it∣tle after Midnight, and then complemented each other up∣on the finishing of that important Negotiation. The Em∣peror and the Empire's Plenipotentiaries were in the Hall the greatest part, if not all the Time; but they did not give their Consent to what was done, nor in the least assisted i bringing the Matter to a Period: But on the contrary, some of the Ministers of the Electors, and other Princes of the Em∣pire, that were present, required the Mediator to enter Protestation, That this was the second time that a Separate Peace had been concluded with France, (meaning that of Ni∣meguen for one) wherein the Emperor and Empire had been excluded: And that the States of the Empire, who (as they said) had been cheated through an Over-credulity, would not, for the future, be so easily brought to make Alliances But the Spanish Plenipotentiaries, and especially Don Be∣nardo de Quiros, excusing themselves, replied, That he ha for a long time been made acquainted with his Prince's Plea∣sure; and that he had Orders for delaying the matter longer, but to sign the Treaty which had been agreed on be∣fore:
And that if he had signed the same some time sooner, according to his Master's Orders, the French would not have taken Barcelona: But that having been over-perswaded to it by the Imperial Ministers, he had deferred the Execu∣tion of it, and thereby not a little lessen'd his Master's Fa∣vour towards him. I believe also the Spaniards perceived that the English and Dutch could have saved Barcelona this Year, if they had pleased; but that they rather declined it, with an Intention to bring the Spaniards the more readily to comply with the Offers of the French; and so much the rather, since they said upon this Occasion (and that most truly to) in their own Justification, That they had bore alone the Burthen of the War, by keeping of great Fleets, and numerous Land-Forces, which they had set out at their own Charge, for the common Good; and, notwithstanding so many States and Princes of the Empire, they had paid, almost alone, the Expences of the War all along the Rhine: And that Trade not having its ordinary Course, all this bore very hard upon them. To this may be added, the ad∣vantageous Conditions of Peace granted them; and first to begin with that of the English, for whom and himself, no Man surely in his Wits will deny, but King William made as honourable Terms, as could in Reason, under the Cir∣cumstances of things, be expected: But a better View here∣of will be had by the Articles themselves, which follow: I. That there be an Universal Perpetual Peace,The Articles of Peace be∣tween Eng∣land and France. and a Truce and Sincere Friendship between the Most Serene and Mighty Prince William the Third, King of Great Britain, and the most Serene and Mighty Prince Lewis the Four∣teenth, the most Christian King, their Heirs and Succes∣sors, and between the Kingdoms, States and Subjects of Both, and that the same be so Sincerely and Inviolably ob∣served and kept, that the one shall promote the Interest, Honour, and Advantage of the other, and that on both sides, a faithful Neighbourhood and true Observation of Peace and Friendship, may daily Flourish and Encrease. II. That all Enmities, Hostilities, Discords, and Wars, between the said King of Great Britain and the most Chri∣stian King, and their Subjects, cease and be abolished, so that on both sides they forbear and abstain hereafter from all Plundring, Depredation, Harm-doing, Injuries, and Infestation whatsoever, as well by Land as by Sea, and on fresh Waters, every where; and especially throughout all the Kingdoms, Territories, Dominions, and Places, be∣longing to each other, of what Condition soever they be.
III. That all Offences, Injuries, Damages, which the said King of Great Britain and his Subjects, or the said most Christian King, and his Subjects have suffered from each other during this War, shall be forgotten, so that neither on Account of them, or for any other Cause or Pretence, neither Party, or the Subjects of either, shall hereafter do, cause or suffer to be done any Hostility, En∣mity, Molestation, or Hindrance to the other, by him∣self or others, Secretly or Openly, Directly or Indirectly, by Colour of Right or Way of Fact. IV. And since the most Christian King was never more desirous of any thing, than that the Peace be firm and in∣violable, the said King Promises and Agrees for himself and his Successors, That he will on no account whatsoever disturb the said King of Great Britain in the free Posses∣sion of the Kingdoms, Countries, Lands or Dominions which he now Enjoys; and therefore Engages his Honour, upon the Faith and Word of a King, that he will not give or afford any Assistance, directly or indirectly, to any Enemy or Enemies of the said King of Great Britain; And that he will in no manner whatsoever, favour the Con∣spiraces or Plots which any Rebels, or ill disposed Persons, may in any place Excite or Contrive against the said King; And for that end, Promises and Engages, That he will not assist with Arms, Ships, Ammunition, Provisions, or Mo∣ney, or in any other way, by Sea or by Land, any Person, or Persons, who shall hereafter, under any pretence what∣soever, Disturb or Molest the said King of Great Britain, in the free and full Possession of his Kingdoms, Countries, Lands and Dominions. The King of Great Britain like∣wise Promises and Engages for himself and Successors, Kings of Great Britain, That he will inviolably do and perform the same towards the said most Christian King▪ his Kingdoms, Countries, Lands and Dominions. V. That there be a free use of Navigation and Com∣merce between the Subjects of both the said Kings, as was formerly in the time of Peace, and before the Declara∣tion of the late War, so that every of them may freely come into the Kingdoms, Marts, Ports and Rivers of ei∣ther of the said Kings with their Merchandizes, and may there continue and Trade without any Molestation, and shall use and enjoy all Liberties, Immunities and Priviled∣ges granted by solemn Treaties, and ancient Custom. VI. That the ordinary Administration of Justice shall be restored and st open, throughout the Kingdoms and Dominions of both Kings, so that it shall be free for all the Subjects of either, to claim and obtain their Rights▪ Pretensions and Actions, according to the Laws, Constitu∣tions and Statutes of each Kingdom.
VII.

And this Restitution shall be made on both Sides, within the Space of Six Months, or sooner if it can be done. And to that end immediately after the Ratification of this Treaty, each of the said Kings shall Deliver, or cause to be Delivered to the other, or to Commissioners Authorized in his Name for that Purpose, all Acts of Concession, Instruments, and necessary Orders, duly made and in proper Form; so that they may have their Effect.

That within the space of 4 Months or sooner, he may inquire into the contrary, or procure that satisfaction be made with all speed from the Party offending, to the Complainant. But if the King against whose Subjects Reprisals are demanded, have no Minister residing there, Letters of Reprisal shall not be granted, till after the space of 4 Months, to be reckoned from the Day on which his Petition was made and presented to the King, against whose Subjects Reprisals are desired, or to his Pri∣vy Council. X. For cutting off all matter of Dispute and Contention, which may arise concerning the Restitution of Ships, Mer∣chandises, and other moveable Goods, which either Par∣ty may complain to be taken and detained from the other, in Countries, and on Coasts far distant, after the Peace is concluded, and before it be notified there; All Ships, Mer∣chandises, and other moveable Goods, which shall be taken by either side, after the Signing and Publication of the pre∣sent Treaty, within the space of Twelve Days in the Bri∣tish and North Seas, as far as the Cape St. Vincent; Within the space of Ten Weeks beyond the said Cape, and on this side of the Equinoctial Line or Equator, as well in the Ocean and Mediterranean Sea as elsewhere, Lastly, within the space of six Months beyond the said Line throughout the whole World, shall belong and remain unto the Possessors, with∣out any Exception or further Distinction of Time or Place, or any consideration to be had of Restitution or Compen∣sation. XI. But if it happens through Inadvertency or Impru∣dence, or any other Cause whatever, that any Subject of either of the said two Kings, shall do or commit any thing by Land or Sea, or on fresh Water, any where, contrary to the present Treaty, or that any Particular Article there∣of is not fulfilled; this Peace and good Correspondence between the said two Kings shall not on that account be Interrupted or Infringed, but shall remain in its former Force, Strength and Vigour, and the said Subject only shall answer for his own Fact, and undergo the Punish∣ment
to be Inflicted, according to the Custom and Law of Nations. XII. But if (which God forbid) the Differences now Com∣posed between the said Kings should at any time be renew∣ed, and break out into open War, the Ships, Merchandises and all kind of moveable Goods of either Party, which shall be found to be and remain in the Ports and Dominions of the adverse Party, shall not be Confiscated or brought un∣der any Inconveniency, but the whole space of six Months shall be allowed to the Subject of both of the said Kings, that they may carry away and transport the aforesaid Goods, and any thing else that is theirs, whither they shall think fit, without any Molestation. XIII. For what concerns the Principality of Orange, and other Lands and Dominions belonging to the said King of Great Britain; the separate Article of the Treaty of Ni∣meguen, concluded between the most Christian King and the States General of the United Provinces the 10th Day of August, 1678. shall, according to its Form and Tenor, have full effect, and all things that have been Innovated and Al∣tered, shall be restored as they were before. All Decrees, Edicts, and other Acts, of what kind soever they be, with∣out Exception, which are in a manner contrary to the said Treaty, or were made after the conclusion thereof, shall be held to be null and void, without any revival or conse∣quence for the future: And all things shall be restored to the said King in the same state, and in the same manner, as he held and enjoyed them before he was dispossessed thereof in the time of the War, which was ended by the said Treaty of Nimeguen, or which he ought to have held and enjoyed according to the said Treaty. And that an end may be put to all Trouble, Differences, Processes and Questions, which may arise concerning the same, both the said Kings will name Commissioners, who, with full and summary Power, may compose and settle all these matters. And forasmuch as by the Authority of the most Christian King, the King of Great Britain was hindred from enjoy∣ing the Revenues, Rights and Profits, as well of his Prin∣cipality of Orange, as of other his Dominions, which after the conclusion of the Treaty of Nimeguen, until the Decla∣ration of the present War, were under the power of the said most Christian King, the said most Christian King will restore, and cause to be restored in reality, with Effect, and with the Interest due, all those Revenues, Rights and Profits, according to the Declarations and Verifications that shall be made before the said Commissioners.

Whereas 'twill greatly conduce to the publick Tran∣quility, that the Treaty be observed, which was concluded between his Sacred most Christian Majesty and his Royal Highness of Savoy, on the Ninth of Aug. 1696. 'tis agreed that the said Treaty shall be confirmed by this Article. XVI. Under this present Treaty of Peace, shall be com∣prehended those who shall be named by either Party, with common consent, before the Exchange of Ratifications, or within six Months after.

In Testimony of all and every the things before men∣tioned, and for their greater Force, and to give them all the Vigour and full Authority they ought to have, the Underwritten Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipoten∣tiaries, together with the Illustirous and most Excellent the Extraordinary Ambassador Mediator, have Signed and Seal∣ed the present Instrument of Peace. Done, &c. Signed by the English and French Ambas∣sadors, and by the Metiator. Separate Article. Besides all that is Concluded and Stipulated by the Trea∣ty of Peace Signed this present Day, the 20th of Sptember, it is moreover agreed by the present separate Article, which
shall have the same Force and Effect as if it was inserted word for word in the said Treaty, That the most Christian King shall convenant and agree, that it shall be free for the Emperor and Empire, until the first Day of Novemher next, to accept the Conditions of Peace lately proposed by the most Christian King, according to the Declaration made on the first Day of this present Month, unless in the mean time it shall be otherwise agreed between his Imperi∣al Majesty and the Empire, and his most Christian Maje∣sty. And in Case his Imperial Majesty, does not within the time prefixed, accept those Conditions, or that it be not otherwise agreed between his Imperial Majesty and the Empire, and his most Christian Majesty, the said Treaty shall have its full Effect, and be duly put in Execution ac∣cording to its Form and Tenor; And it shall not be law∣ful for the King of Great Britain, directly or indirectly, on any account or cause whatsoever, to act contrary to the said Treaty. Having thus premised the English Articles, we shall next add those of the Dutch. IN the Name of God, and of the Holy Trinity. Be it known to all present and to come, That whereas after a long continuance of the most Bloody War, that Europe, time out of mind, has been afflicted with, it hath pleas'd Divine Providence, to prepare for Christendom the end of her Miseries, by cherishing a fervent Desire of Peace in the Heart of the Most High, Most Excellent, and Most Po∣tent Prince, Lewis XIV. by the Grace of God, Most Chri∣stian King of France and Navarr, his Most Christian Maje∣sty moreover, not having any other Intention then to render it solid and perpetual, by the Equity of the Conditions, and the Lords the States General of the United Provinces of the Low-Countries, being no less desirous, sincerely, and as much as in them lies, to concur toward the Establishment of the publick Tranquility, and return to the ancient Amity and Affection of his Most Christian Majesty, have consented, in the first place, in order to it, to acknowledge the Medi∣ation of the Most High, Most Excellent, and Most Potent Prince, Chares XI. of Glorious Memory, by the Grace of God, King of Sweden, the Goths and Vandals; but a hasty Death having cross'd the Hopes that all Europe had justly conceiv'd of his Counsels and good Offices. His Most Christian Majesty, and the said Lords the States General, persisting in their Resolution to stop, as soon as may be, the Effusion of so much Christian Blood, thought they could not take a better Course, than still to acknowledge, under
the same Character, the Most High, Most Excellent, and Thrice Potent Prince, Charles XII. King of Sweden, his Son and Successor, who on his side has also continu'd the same Cares for the Advancement of the Peace between his Most Christian Majesty, and the said Lords the States General▪ in the Conferences held for this purpose in the Castle of Ryswick, in the Province of Holland, between the Extraor∣dinary Embassadors and Plenipotentiaries appointed on both sides; that is to say, On the behalf of his Most Christian Majesty, the Sieur Nicholas Augustus de Harlay, Knight, Lord of Bonnueil, &c. the Sieur Lewis de Verjus, Knight, Count of Crecy, &c. and the Sieur Francis de Callieres, Knight, Lord of Callieres, &c.

V. And in pursuance of this Amity and good Correspon∣dence, as well his Majesty, as the Lords the States Gene∣ral, shall cordially procure and advance the Good and Pro∣sperity of each other, by all the Ways of Support, Aid, Counsel, and real Assistances upon all Occasions, and at all
Times, and shall not consent for the future, to any Trea∣ties or Negotiations, which may be prejudicial to each other, but shall break 'em, and give reciprocal Informa∣tion thereof, with Care and Sincerity, so soon as they shall come to their Knowledge. VI. They who have had any Estates seiz'd and confis∣cated, by reason of the said War, their Heirs, or such who have right thereto, of what Condition or Religion soever they may be, shall enjoy the said Estates, and shall take Possession of 'em by their own private Authority, by vir∣tue of this present Treaty, without being constrain'd to have recourse to Justice, notwithstanding any Incorpora∣tions into the Treasury, Deeds of Gift, Preparatory or De∣finitive Sentences, given for Default and Contumacy in the Absence, or without hearing the Parties; Treaties, Ac∣cords and Transactions, whatever Renunciations may have been put in the said Transactions to exclude the Parties to whom the said Estates belong; and all and every the Estates and Rights, which according to conformity to this present Treaty shall be restor'd, or ought to be restor'd recipro∣cally to the said Proprietors, their Heirs, or such as have right, may be sold by the said Proprietors, without any necessity of demanding particular consent so to do: Also the Proprietors of Rents, which on the behalf of the pub∣lick Treasury shall be constituted in the place of Goods sold; as also of Rents and Actions, being at the charge of the publick Treasury respectively, shall dispose of the Proprie∣ty of them, by Rent, or otherwise, as of their own proper Estates. VII, And in regard the Marquisate of Bergen op Zoo, with all the Rights and Revenues that belong to it, and generally all the Lordships and Estates belonging to M. the Count d' Auvergne, Colonel-General of the Light Horse of France, and which are in the Power of the said Lords the States General of the United Provinces, have been seiz'd and confiscated by reason of the War, to which this pre∣sent Treaty is to put a happy Conclusion, it is agreed, That the said Count d' Auvergne shall be restor'd to the Possession of the said Marquisate of Bergen op Zoom, its Ap∣purtenancies and Dependancies, as also to the Rights, Acti∣ons, Privileges, Usages and Prerogatives which he enjoy'd before the War was declar'd.

Thus having inserted the English and Dutch Articles at full length, nothing less can be expected, than that I should do the like by the Spaniards, who will be thought not to have fared the worse for the Peace. But before I give you the Particulars of them,Mr. Ponti's Expedition: let me pre∣mise in this place a short Scearch of Mr. Ponti's Expedition to the Spanish West-Indies, from whence he returned about this time: He set out from Brest towards the beginning of this Year, from whence he directed his Course thither, and in Fifty five Days arrived at St. Domingo; from which Go∣vernment he was considerably Re-inforced, and being also joined by all the Bucanneers in those Parts, he proceeded to put his Project in Execution; he was much furthered there∣in by one Venner an English-man, who had served the Spa∣niards many Years, and drew him several Plans of Cartha∣gena, by which he saw there was a necessity of possessing him∣self, upon his first Arrival, of a considerable Post, called Nostre Dame de la Pouppe, or else the Spaniards would have an Opportunity to carry off whatsoever they were desirous to save: But not being able to effect that, through the Si∣tuation of the Place, he fell upon the Fort of Boeca Chica with all his Fury; and notwithstanding the difficult Ap∣proaches thereunto, the dastardliness of the Buccaneers, in his Service, (whom himself, throughout his whole Narra∣tion, makes to be the veriest Rogues, Cowards, and Vil∣lains imaginable) and other Inconveniences, he reduced to that streight, in a short time, as to surrender upon Discre∣tion, the Gate being thrown open unto him; and old San∣chez Ximenes, who had been Governour thereof above Five and twenty Years, came and delivered the Keys into his possession. From hence they proceed and took in the Fort of St. Lazarus, and then attack'd Carthagena it self, both by Sea and Land. The Place was attacked and defended with a great deal of Vigour;Takes Car∣thagena. but the Spanish Succours not coming in time, and some Breaches being made, they began at last to Capitulate, whereby they were to March out through the Breach, with all those carrying Arms, Drums beating, and four Pieces of Cannon: But for the rest, all Silver, without Exception or Reserve, should belong to the Victor; and that such of the Inhabitants as staid behind, should enjoy all they had, excepting their Plate, &c. In pursuance of these Articles, the Governor marched out on the 6th of May, and Ponti entred in; who notwithstanding the Agreement of having all the Silver, was in great per∣plexity
how to come at it: Wherefore for an Expedient, he ordered it to set up on the principal Gates, That he would give the Tenth to the Proprietors, of whatsoever they honestly brought him, and a Tenth to them that should inform him, of any Persons that did not declare their Ef∣fects, to which he added his Threats of Punishment for for∣mal Disobedience, which had the desired effect upon the ge∣nerality of the People; neither were the Churches and Re∣ligious Houses spared, though the Monsieur is pleased to soften that part with saying, They gathered only what was for the Decoration of them. Tho' after all, the Booty fell much short of their Expectations; for the Place having taken the Allarum before their Arrival, all the Women of Quality and Others, with their Jewels, and 120 Mules laden with Gold were gone a great way out of their reach: And how basely soever the Buccaneers served him in this Expedition, they had their assigned Proportion of the Spoil, tho' they were not at all satisfied with it. But notwithstanding the Importance of this Conquest, they did not think it adviseable to hold it; and therefore having demeaned themselves, as Conquerors, under such Circumstances used to do, and ruined the Fort of Bocca Chica, on the last of May, they put out to Sea, June 1st, standing for Cape Tuberon, when an Advice-boat from Petit Gu came and informed them that 13 English Men of War were arrived on the 27th of April at Barbadoes to look after them,Descryes and Escapes Admiral Neville. which made them alter their Course for the Streights of B∣hama, till Six at Night when they fell in with them, and proved to be much stronger than they were informed: They presently took a Fly-boat of theirs, on Board of which there was a considerable Quantity of Ammunition and Provision, and also the only Traversier they had: But while this was doing, half of the English Fleet that were got within rea of them, seemed to decline Engaging, till the others to Leward could come to the Action, which gave the French a Opportunity to get before them; but the advanced part the English Fleet having yet got to Windward of them, and within less than Cannon-shot, the French who saw no Re∣medy now, gave the Signal for Fighting; But the English Admiral, Nevill, reckoning there was no safety for the French but to go before the Wind for the Streights of B∣hama, slackned his way, proposing to get so much a head o them, as to hinder their Passage: Hereupon the French, at the Closing in of the Night, tacked about, and found the success of their working next day, for they could reckon more than 14 Ships following them in a Line, and they not so high by far as the day before, which made the French continue the same Board, till they got within 20 Leagues
Carthagena, where they were on the 9th of June, in the Even∣ing, whereof they made a Signal for holding the contrary Course; and when 'twas quite Dark, gave three Guns for all their Ships to steer West directly before the Wind, at what time there were but three of the English that kept within sight of them, and them at a great distance, so that next day they got clear off of them. From hence the French, having made so narrow an Escape, not without some dishonour to our Commanders, for want of better Management, sailed for Newfoundland, and put in for Water (whereof they had not above what would have served them for six days longer) to Conception-Bay on the 4th of August; and afterwards sailed for that of St. John's, where lay the English Ships under Commadore Norris, who supposing the French (now mightily weakned with Sickness) to be much stronger than they were, declined putting out to Fight them; and so they escaped a scouring a second time, but that they should do so in their Passage from hence to France (where they arrived on the 19th of August) from six English Men of War that attacked them, is more they owned, than themselves could have expected in the pittiful Plight they were reduced to; and what, I think, now is like to remain a Mystery, since there is no appearance of any far∣ther Inquiry likely to be made into it. But to return from this Interruption of War, to the Ar∣ticles of the Peace, those between France and Spain, were these that follow. IN the Name of God, and the Most Holy Trinity, to all present and to come, be it known, That whereas during the Course of the most bloody War with which Europe has been so long a time afflicted, it has pleased Divine Provi∣dence to provide for Christendom the End of all her Mise∣ries, by kindling and preserving a fervent Desire of Peace in the Hearts of the Most High, Most Excellent, and Most Potent Prince, Lewis XIV. by the Grace of God, Most Chri∣stian King of France and Navarre, and the Most High, Most Excellent, and Most Potent Prince, Charles II. Catholick King of Spain; who desiring cordially, and as much as in them lies, to concurr, toward the Re-establishment of the Publick Tranquility, and more-over, not having any other Design than to render it solid and perpetual by the Equity of the Conditions, their said Majesties unanimously consent∣ed to submit for that purpose, to the Mediation of the Most High, Most Excellent, and Most potent. Prince, of Glorious Memory, Charles XI. by the Grace of God, King of Swe∣den, the Goths and Vandals, &c. but sudden Death having cross'd the Hope which all Europe had conceiv'd of the hap∣py
Issue of his Counsels, and his good Offices, their said Ma∣jesties persisting still in a Resolution, as soon as might be, to stop the Effusion of so much Christian Blood, believed they could not do better than still to acknowledge in the same Quality, the Most High, the Most Excellent, and Most potent Prince, Charles XII. King of Sweden, his Son and Suc∣cessor, who on his part has continu'd the same Cares for the advancing of the Peace between their Most Christian and Catholick Majesties, in the Conferences that have been held at the Castle of Ryswick, in the Province of Hol∣land, between the Extraordinary Embassadors and Plenipo∣tentiaries appointed on both sides. That is to say, on the part of his Most Christian Majesty, the Sieur Nicholas Au∣gustus de Harlay, Knight, Lord of Bonneuil, Count de Cely, the King's Counsellor in Ordinary, in his Council of State, the Sieur Lewis Chevalier Verjus, Count de Crecy, the King's Counsellor in Ordinary, in his Council of State, Marquiss de Freon, Baron of Cauvay, Lord of Boulay, the two Chur∣ches of Fort Isle, du Muillet, and other Places, and the Sieur Francis de Callieres, Knight, Lord of Callieres de la Rochellay, and Gigny; and on the part of his Catholick Majesty, Se∣nior Don Francisco Bernardo de Quiros, Knight of the Order of St. James, the King's Counsellor in his Royal and Supream Council of Castille, and the Sieur Lewis Alexander de Stockart, Count of Tirlemont, Baron de Gaesbeke, Counsellor in the Su∣pream Council of State for the Low Countries at Madrid, in the Councils of State and Privy-Council within the said Countries, who having first implor'd the Assistance of Hea∣ven, and respectively imparted their full Powers, Copies of which shall be inserted Word for Word at the end of this present Treaty, and duly exchang'd 'em by the Interposi∣tion and Mediation of the Sieur Nicholas, Baron de Lilienr▪ Embassador Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiary of his Ma∣jesty the King of Sweden, who has discharg'd his Office of Mediator with all requisite Prudence, Capacity, and Equi∣ty, they agreed, for the Glory of God and the Good of Christendom, upon the Conditions following: I. It is agreed and consented, That for the future there shall be a good, firm and lasting Peace, Confederacy, and perpetual Alliance and Amity, between the Most Christian and Catholick Kings, their Children born, and to be born, Inheritors, Heirs, and Successors, their Kingdoms, States, Countries, and Subjects, that they shall reciprocally love each other like Brothers, procuring to the utmost of their Power, the Good, Honour and Reputation of each other, sincerely, and as much as in them lies, avoiding what-ever may cause the Damage either of the one or the other.
II. In pursuance of this Peace, and good Union, all Acts of Hostilities shall cease between the said Kings, their Sub∣jects, and Vassals, as well by Sea, and other Waters, as by Land, and generally, in all Places where the War has been carry'd on by their Majesties Arms, as well between their Armies as between the Garrisons of their Strong Holds; and if it were transgress'd by the taking of one or several Places, either by Attack, by Surprize, or by Correspondence, or if any Prisoners were taken, or if any other Acts of Ho∣stility were committed by Chance, or otherwise, the Breach shall be sincerely repair'd on both sides, without scruple or delay, restoring, without Dimunition, what shall have been possess'd, and delivering the Prisoners without Ransom or Payment of Charges. III. All Causes of Enmity or Misunderstanding shall be extinguish'd and abolish'd for ever. There shall be on both sides a perpetual Oblivion and Amnesty of what-ever has been done during this present War, or by reason thereof; so that there may be no Prosecutions on either side, direct∣ly nor indirectly, upon any Pretence what-ever; nor shall their said Majesties, their Subjects, Servants, nor Adherents, testifie any Resentment, nor pretend to any sort of Repara∣tion. IV. The Strong Holds, Gironne, Roses, and Belver, shall be restor'd and left in Possession, Demesne, and Soveraignty of his Catholick Majesty, as they were when taken, with the Artillery which was found there at the same time, and in general, all the other Cities, Strong Holds, Forts, Pla∣ces, and Castlewicks which have been possess'd during this War by his Most Christian Majesty's Arms, and since the Treaty of Nimeguen, within the Principality of Catalogna or other where in Spain, their Appurtenances, Dependencies, and Annexes, shall be restor'd in the Condition as now they are, without retaining, reserving, weak'ning, or impairing any thing.

VI. The Fortress of Charleroy shall be likewise surrender'd back into the Power, and under the Soveraignty of his Ca∣tholick Majesty, with its Dependencies in the Condition it now is, without breaking, demolishing, weak'ning, or im∣pairing any thing; as also the Artillery that was at the time when it was taken.

In pursuance of which, all Prosecutions, Sentences, Separations, Incorporations, Forfeitures, Judgments, Confis∣cations, Re-unions, Declarations, Regulations, Edicts, and generally all Acts what-ever put forth in the Name and be∣half of his Most Christian Majesty, by reason of the said Re∣unions,

XXXIII. In regard it is of high Concernment to the pub∣lick Tranquility, that the Peace concluded at Turin, the 29th of August, 1696. between his Most Christian Majesty and his Roval Highness of Savoy, should be also exactly observ'd, it is thought convenient to confirm and comprehend it in this present Treaty, and in all its Points, such as are contain'd in the Copy, sign'd and seal'd by the Plenipotentiaries of Savoy, and which shall be annex'd to the present Treaty; for the due observance of which, and the present Treaty, their said Majesties do give his Royal Highness their Guar∣ranty.

But though the Imperialists seemed to be a little concern'd at these Proceedings of their Allies, yet they thought it the most advisable way to agree to a Cessation of Arms,Eberenburg aken by the Germans. And a Cessa∣tion of Arms. which was done two Days after the Signing of this Treaty, and Ex∣presses were immediately Dispatched to the respective Armies upon the Rhine, to cease from any further acts of Hostility: Yet before advice could come hereof to Prince Lewis of Baden, he had taken the Castle of Eberemburg, and was going to lay Siege to Kirn also. But what was perhaps more mortifying to the Imperial Ministers, than all the rest was, that advice had not come a few days sooner of the wonderful Success of the Emperors Arms in Hungary, which, would in all likeli∣hood have a little cooled the eagerness of those powers that had already signed the Peace, and made the French more com∣plyant with the Emperor and Empire's Demands: But though they failed herein, yet certainly such an advantageous Bat∣tle has not been fought in the whole course of this Bloody War, which had now lasted for 15 Years: And before we go any further, its fit we should give a few particulars of this memorable Action. The Imperialis, is true, miscarried in the first Design they had concerted to begin the Campaign with the taking of Bi∣hatz, the more than ordinary Opposition they met with there, and the Rebellion that brake forth in Vpper Hungary, which was calculated to have begun about the time of the Election of Poland, having occasioned them to draw their Troops that way: But though the Head of this last Hydra was quickly cut off, yet the Turks, headed again by the Grand Seignior in Per∣son, seemed to come very formidable into the Field, and threatned to give new Life to this Monster again, or to push quite through Transylvania, and thereby entirely despoil the Emperor of the Benefit of that Principality; Though other Aspects of the Enemies Motion gave the Germans Umbrage, that they designed to attack Peter Waradin. But while Prince Eugenius of Savoy, who commanded the Imperial Army, lay at Belsche, he received, upon the 12th of Sept. the Confirma∣tion of the Intelligence that he had had before, That the In∣fidels had a Design to march directly to Segedin, with this Addition, That several Parties of Turks and Tartars were sent out to burn and plunder the Country. A Captain of Zenta also, Tokeli by Name, reported, That about Noon the Ene∣my was at Zenta, and that they had detached a Body of Horse, in order to destroy all before them. For the better Assu∣rance of the Truth of which, two Parties of 60 Horses apiece were sent upon the Scout: In the mean time the Army de∣camped before Day, and marched in 12 Columns, Six of Horse, and Six of Foot, the Artillery in the middle; in which Order they continued their March till 9 in the Afternoon;
in which time some of the Parties sent to get Intelligence, brought word, That they met the Enemies Guards near Zen∣ta. Hereupon the Hussars were immediately sent away to succour and bring them off; who, having performed their Orders, took a Bassa Prisoner, and returned without the Loss of one Man. The Bassa was examined, and threatned to have his Head cut off▪ if he did not tell the Truth: He told them. That the Grand Seignior had a real Design to march direct∣ly to Segedin, and to try if he could make himself Master of it in his March, because he was assured by Tekely and the Corusss, That it might be easily taken before the Imperial Army could overtake them; and withal, That the City was defenceless. But understanding that the Imperialists, who were decamped from Peter Waradin, followed them close at the Heels, and that there was a numerous Garrison in Segedin, he had stopt at Zenta, and had laid a Bridge over the Theysse, which they had brought in Waggons, and which had been built at Belgrade last Winter by the Direction of a Frenchman, being a neat, good, commodious Invention; That now the Grand Seignior had a Design to march into Transilvania and Vpper Hungary, to which purpose he had already passed the Theysse in Person with some Thousands of Horse; That the last Night, when this Bassa was sent upon the Scout, the Artille∣ry and heavy Baggage began to pass the same River, but that the rest of the Army was still on the other side, with above an Hundred Pieces of Cannon; nor could he tell whether those Troops would pass the River or no; That in the mean time the Turks were already intreched, and that they had begun to cast another Intrenchment at the Head of the Bridge. The Bassa added, That the Tartars, Corusses, and some Turks, burnt all the Country before them; though, as he said, they had received no such Orders from the Sultan, which was not easie to be believed. Upon this Information the Army con∣tinued their March, receiving Advice every Moment by the Hussars and Spies, That the Enemy was still crossing the Ri∣ver, and that their Cavalry were stirred out of their Intrench∣ments according to Custom, to skirmish with the Christians. Two Hours after other Prisoners gave an Account, That the greatest part of the Horse were already on the other side of the River, and the rest were hasting to pass it. All this while the Imperialists could not imagine that the Infantry could stay alone on this side the River, because that the Night before they had done no more than only begun to make a second Retrenchment, according to the Report of the Bassa and other Prisoners. This obliged Prince Eugenius to advance with the Cavalry, and some Artillery, within an Hours March of Zenta, receiving divers Confirmations in his March of what had been reported. The Prince, being come to the
Place before-mentioned, staid there for the Foot, which be∣ing arrived, he drew up the Army in Battle-Array; the Right Wing was secured by the Theysse,The Battle of Zenta. the Left was extended as far as the Men could take up any Ground, the Left Flank was reinforced with a Second Line. In this Order he made a Halt till 3 of the Clock, and half an hour past; at what time the Army marched in Battle-Array. Being come near Zenta, they could perceive but Two Thousand of the Enemies Horse. The Van Courriers also reported, That they viewed the Turks Bridge, over which Troops were continually passing, insomuch that there was a great deal of Confusion upon the Bridge. Upon which Prince Eugenius took three Regi∣giments of Dragoons out of both the Wings, and two more out of the second Line of the Flank, with some Pieces of Cannon, and putting himself at the Head of that Detach∣ment, advanced towards the Enemy with all the Speed he could, giving Order for the rest of the Army to follow him in order of Battle. All this while the Enemy's Horse made over the Bridge as fast as they could; so that the Prince could easily perceive the Confusion that was upon the Bridge, there being a World of Baggage still on this side. Being thus advanced within Cannon-shot of the Enemy's Detach∣ments, the Turks began to play upon the Imperialists with their great Guns, which the Christians answered, while the Army still advanced, and the six Regiments which had been detached were ordered to their Stations in the Army. In this Order the Army advanced within half Cannon-shot of the Enemy's Entrenchments, there remaining no more than two Hours of Day-light. The Right Wing was then as it were lin'd by the River, together with some Regiments of the Flank of the Left; at what time they perceiv'd the Enemy's Horse were endeavouring to slide between them and the Ri∣ver, and so fall upon that Wing; but they found that im∣possible: In the mean time they planted some Pieces of Can∣non upon that Wing, with which they plaid continually a∣gainst the Bridge; and the same Order was observed in the Right Wing, and immediately after the Fight began on every side. I have already told you, that the Turkish Ca∣valry endeavour'd to slip between the River and the Left Wing, which the Imperialists perceiving, and observing that there was a Space of Ground between 30 and 40 Paces broad between the Enemy and the River, from whence they might fall upon the Enemy's Rear, they planted some Cannon there with all speed, and ordered the Enemy to be attack'd by the Infantry of the Flank and the Left Wing, some time before the main Body and the Foot of the Right Wing could do it. This succeeded , notwithstanding the thick Fire of the Enemy with their great Guns laden with Car∣touches,
and the continual Vollies of their Small-shot; so that the Infantry of the Left Wing broke in upon them; and then the Army, as well Horse as Foot, fell on at the same Instant that the Enemy was already in some Disorder by reason of those who had already fallen upon their Backs, There were two Entrenchments, one behind another, besides a Barricado of Waggons; and they were so good, that it is not easie to apprehend how the Foot could force them. The Victors passed them both in half an Hours time, during which there was nothing but Fire and Smoak on both sides. The Horse also advanced at the same time with the Infan∣try to the Moat of the Entrenchment, where they stood the Enemy's Fire, and charged in the same manner as the Foot, which perhaps was hardly ever seen before. So soon as the Infantry of the Left Wing had broken into the Entrench∣ments, all the Army acted together with equal Force; nor was it possible to restrain the Soldiers. One part of the Cavalry alighted from their Horses, and passed the Moat over the slain Enemy. In the mean time the Germans of the Left Wing and Flank, cut off the Turks way to the Bridge, whence followed a most horrible Slaughter, as well within the En∣trenchments, as upon the Bridge, and in the River, into which they threw themselves to escape the Imperialists: For the Soldiers were so eager after Blood, that they gave Quarter to no Body, neither Bassa's nor Officers, tho' they promised large Ransoms. Hence it came to pass, that so few Prisoners were taken, and those only such as were found among the Slain, or in the Barks that composed the Bridge: By those it was understood, that all the Turkish Infantry was in the Fight, there being not any on the other side of the River, but about 2000 Men for the Grand Seignior's Guard. Whence it may be concluded, That the Foot were all destroy'd, and that several Thousands were slain. The Fight ended with the Day; nor can we sufficiently set forth the Valour and Courage of the Generals, the Officers and Soldiers, from the highest to the lowest; but principally the Skill and Dexterity of Prince Eugenius is to be extolled, who, tho' much inferiour to the Enemy, knew so well how to watch his Opportunity, that he made himself equal to him in some sort, by falling upon him at a time, that but one part of his Army could fight, the other being on the other side of the River, and not able to succour those that were distress'd. All the Imperialists retreated out of the Trenches, after two Hours within Night, and spent the rest of it as well as they could. However, it were so order'd, that the greatest Number was posted along the Theysse; but it was impossible to rally them all again under their proper Colours. Some were appointed to Guard the Bridge, be∣yond
which was set an advanced Guard. The next day be∣ing the 12th, a Camp was marked out for the Army, and it was found that the Action was much more advantageous than it was thought, as well for the Number of the Slain, as the Number of great Guns, the vast quantities of Bombs, Carcasses, Granadoes, Ammunition and Provision, besides great and small Cattle, by reason of the Enemy's Camp be∣yond the River, which was half a League wide, and which the Turks had quitted. The Fugitives reported, That the Grand Seignior fled in great Consternation to Temeswaer. In their Camp were found all their Tents, with that of the Grand Seignior's himself, several Camels, and other Beasts, heavy Artillery, Bombs, Carcasses, and other Ammunition, besides a prodigious quantity of Provision, and about 6000 Waggons, on both sides the River; and some Men were de∣tach'd to go and make themselves Masters of this Booty. But as it usually happens in such Hurries, the Ammuni∣tion took Fire that Day beyond the Bridge, as it had done the Night before on this side the Bridge; so that a good part of it was consumed, with a great quantity of Victuals, and other Booty. In the Morning a Transilvanian Commis∣sary brought the Grand Seignior's Seal, a curious Piece of Workmanship; which never happened before, in any Bat∣tle that had been fought during this War. Which confirm'd what the Prisoners and Fugitives reported, That the Grand Visier was kill'd; because he is bound always to carry the Seal about his Neck. In the mean time the Hussars, and some other Troops of the Army, pursued the Enemy for above 4 or 5 Leagues together from the Place where the Battle was fought, who found store of Booty by the way, and some lazy Turks, whom they took Prisoners. The same day Colonel Gleckelsberg was sent out in pursuit of the Infidels with 600 Horse, and to pick up what Booty and Prisoners he could. He pursued the flying Enemy as far as Aranga, within half a Mile of Temeswaer; and after his re∣turn, with a considerable Booty which he met with all along the Road, he confirm'd what had been reported of the Grand Seignior's Consternation, and of the small number of Foot that was left him. As for the Loss which the Turks sustained, it augmented every day by new Relations; the last of which gave an Account, That besides the Grand Vi∣sier and the Aga of the Janisaries, there were 27 Bassa's slain upon the Spot, above 20000 Men killed, and about 10 or 12000 drowned in the Theysse, 6000 wounded, and several taken Prisoners. The Booty consisted of 6000 Waggons la∣den with Ammunition and Provision, 6000 Camels, 6000 Horses, 12000 Oxen, and a very great number of other Spoils, with 160 Pieces of Cannon, among which there were
70 of a larger Size for Artillery, 500 Drums, and as many Colours, 74 Pair of Kettle-Drums, the Grand Seignior's Tent, valued at about 4000 Florins, and a Coach, or Cha∣riot, with Six Horses, wherein were 10 Women of the Sul∣tan's Seraglio: It was said, that the whole Booty amounted to several Millions. This Victory was so much the more Glo∣rious, because it was gained with so little Loss to the Impe∣rialists. A loss so small, that it is a rare thing to read of so great a Battle fought, and wun, with so little Effusion of Blood on the Victors Side, some Regiments not loosing a∣bove 1, 2, or 3, others not above 14, 15, or 29, at most. But how Glorious soever this Action was, there was this un∣happiness that did attend it, that it was so late in the Year, that the Germans could go upon no considerable Undertak∣ing and follow the Blow: So that all they did the remain∣der of the Campaign, was to make an Incursion into Bosnia, from whence they returned with a considerable Booty. So we shall leave them, and being so near, will take a step in∣to Poland, and see how their Affairs stood there, before we return to prosecute the remaining Negotiations of the Peace. We have hinted before, that the Elector of Saxony was chosen King of Poland, as much contrary to most Men's Expectations, as the Change of his Religion was thereupon▪ And that for all this, the Prince of Conti his Competitor's Expedition thither (who was in like manner proclaimed King) was at length undertaken: However, Saxony was by much before-hand with him; for besides other Paces made, the Baron de Fleming, as early as July 13th, in his Master's Name, signed the Pacta Conventa; the same being done also by a great Number of the Senators and Principal of the Nobility. The Articles were these, I. THE Kingdom of Poland shall be always preserv'd in its Right of Electing a Sovereign King, so that it may never become Hereditary. II. No King shall be elected who shall not be devoted to the Roman Catholick Church, and who shall not take an Oath constantly to persevere in her Communion. III. Liberty of Conscience shall be preserv'd inviolably in its full Strength and Vigour; and as for the Greek Religion, that shall be taken into Consideration after the Corona∣tion. IV. No Presents shall be taken from those who shall sue for any Offices or Starsties. V. The Queen not to intermeddle with Affairs of Govern∣ment. VI. As to the Administration of the Military Affairs, the Presidents of Vladistaus IV. and John  to be follow'd.
VII. Alliances shall be renew'd. VIII. Endeavours shall be us'd to recover the Vkraine, and to conclude a perpetual Peace with the Muscovites. IX. The Revenues in Money shall not be employ'd to the particular Benefit of the King; nor shall any Money be Coin'd without the Consent of the Republick. X. No Foreign Forces shall be brought into the Kingdom, without the knowledge of the Republick. XI. None shall be employ'd in Embassies, but Gentlemen of good Fortunes. XII. No body shall purchase the Right of Naturalization, but such as have done the Republick important Services. XIII. No body shall be admitted to any Preferment in the Royal Houshold, unless he have first serv'd the Crown. XIV. Nor shall any Person by the Connivance of the Se∣nators, enjoy any petty Revenues of the Crown, without the Consent of the Republick. XV. No Person shall enjoy two considerable Offices at one time, such as are those of the Mareschal and General; but they who now enjoy any Offices, shall continue in the Exer∣cise of 'em, and enjoy the Revenues of 'em without any De∣falcation. XVI. The accustom'd Order in the Administration of Ju∣stice shall be preserv'd without any alteration. XVII. The King, when he has re-taken Caminiec, shall cause it to be fortify'd at his own Charges; but after that, the Republick shall keep the said Fortifications in Repair. XVIII. The Court, and the King's Guards, shall consist of the Natives of the Kingdom. XIX. If the King has a desire to Marry, he shall ad∣vise with the Senators about the Choice of a Wife; and if he takes a Foreigner, she shall not have above six Foreigners in her Service at Court. XX. Only the Latin and Polish Languages shall be made use of for the King's Letters and Orders. XXI. The Laws, call'd Pacta Henricea, shall be observ'd in the Judgments call'd Postcurialia; and when any Difficulty shall arise, Judgment shall be given with the Counsellors Assessors. XXII. The Differences which are in the—shall be de∣termin'd with all speed that may be. XXIII. That no new Custom or Novelty shall be admit∣ted in the Order of the King's Table, but that the ancient Custom shall be exactly observ'd. XXIV. Places becoming vacant in the Intervals of Dyets, shall be supply'd in six Weeks.
XXV. The Militia shall be so regulated at the Dyet of the Coronation that is to come, that there shall be no need of Foreign Troops; and Military Discipline shall be exact∣ly observ'd. XXVI. That the Salt shall be tax'd and shar'd out in all the Palatinates, according to the ancient Custom. XXVII. That all Gentlemen shall have the Freedom of the Salt Mines. XXVIII. The ancient Privileges of the Palatinates shall re∣main inviolable. XXX. All the Privileges which belong to the Universities of Cracow, and other Cities, as well Ecclesiastick as Secular, as also all the Articles which were promis'd upon Oath at the Coronations of the Kings, Henry, Stephen, Sigismond Vladistaus, John Casimir, and others, shall be renew'd at this Election; which if it be not done, or any thing endeavour'd to the contrary of these Articles, then the Inhabitants of Poland and Lithuania to be free and disingag'd from their Obedience. This being over, the new King advanced towards Poland, and upon the Frontiers was harangued by the Embassy sent to him by the Republick, or at least a Party of it; And having himself Swore to the Pacta Conventa, and given suf∣ficient Testimony of his being reconciled to the Romish Church, he deliver'd himself to the Nobility that attended him in the following manner: MY Dear and Good Friends, You have chosen Me to be Your King, You are come to offer Me the Crown, and You have brought Me hither. I am come, and have quitted my Territories and my Country, for Love of You. 'Tis not with a Design to be a Burthen to You, but to bring abundance along with Me, my Wealth, my Forces, and all that belongs to Me, to aug∣ment, as much as in Me lies, the Glory and Honour of Your Na∣tion, by fighting against the Enemies of the Kingdom, more-es∣pecially those of Christendom. Be assur'd, that my Heart shall be always constant and sincere towards my Faithful Subjects, and that my Sword shall only be employ'd in the Defence of Your Li∣berty, and the Authority with which You have invested Me. From Piccari, the King continued his March towards Cra∣cow; And tho', all Circumstances consider'd, he had by far the Advantage over his Adversary, yet there were still innumerable Difficulties, not only to struggle with, in Po∣land, but Saxony it self was also to be taken care of; where∣fore least the sudden Change of his Religion should occa∣sion
any Innovations there, he caused the following Decla∣ration to be affixed upon the Gates of Dresden. FRederick Augustus, by the Grace of God, King of Po∣land, &c. Elector of Saxony, &c. We notifie and make known, That having long since, by Divine Inspira∣tion, resolv'd to return to the Bosom of the Roman Church, wherein our Ancestors liv'd; and whereas for that pur∣pose, without any Allurement of Interest or Profit, but only having God before our Eyes, we have embrac'd the Catholick, Apostolick, and Roman Religion, and that in the mean while it has pleased his Divine Majesty to advance our Person to the Throne of Poland, for which reason we find our selves oblig'd by Affairs of so great Importance to absent our selves for some time from our Dear Country, the Electorate of Saxony: and seeing that for these Reasons, and because of our Change, the States of our said Country, and our Dear Subjects may believe that we have a Design to abolish their ancient Priviledges, we have thought fit to declare, That we have not any the least Thought to over-charge 'em in any manner whatso∣ever, contrary to their aforesaid ancient Priviledges, but rather graciously to maintain our said States and Subjects in all their Liberties; assuring 'em, that as we promis'd 'em, when we enter'd into Possession of our Estates, and were settl'd in the Government, and now that we have embrac'd the Roman Religion, that we will maintain and protect our Dear States and Subjects in their Ausburg Con∣fession, in their ancient Possession of Liberty of Conscience, of Churches, of Religious Worship, of Religious Exer∣cise, of Universities, of Schools, and of all other Privi∣ledges which they now enjoy; that in pursuance of this, we will not constrain any Person to embrace our present Catholick Religion, but will leave every Body free in his own Conscience, as we assure 'em upon our Royal and Electoral Word; assuring our selves in the mean time that our Dear States and Subjects, will continue their just Affection, Love, Esteem, and Fidelity, which they have hitherto testify'd to our Person, as their Lawful Elector and Sovereign, and that they will live in Peace, in Re∣pose, and in Union during our Absence for a while; so that the Blessing of God, and all manner of Happiness may more and more increase, to which purpose we will assist our People with all our Power, and at all times give 'em Demonstrations of our Royal and Electoral Affection. And to the end that our present Assurance and Promise may be known to all our States and Subjects of our Electorate and other Countries, we ordain, that being Printed, it be
affix'd in all Places of our Electorate and Country, and that Copies of it be every where distributed and dis∣pers'd. And for the greater Confirmation of what is above written, we have Sign'd this present Act and Promise with our Hand, and Seal'd it with our Seal. At Lobsow, Au∣gust 6. 1697. . AVGVSTVS, K. of Poland, and E. of Saxony. The Prince of Conti in the mean time being buoy'd up by the Primate and his Party, September the 6th left France, and on the 25th arrived before Danzick; but while that City refused his Men the liberty of Landing, and adher'd firmly to the Interest of the Elector, this last was solemnly crowned King at Cracow, September 15. This undoubtedly must be a great Mortification to the Prince of Conti; How∣ever, not to be totally discouraged, and in assurance that the Lithuanian Army would not submit to the new crown'd King, with an Intention farther still to embroil Matters, he wrote the following Letter, and his Party were very se∣dulous to disperse Copies of it. FRancis Lewis de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, and by the Grace of God, and the Affection of the Polish Nation, Elect King of Poland, and the Dutchy of Lithuania, made no haste to come sooner in order to testifie his Acknow∣ledgment, that he might not do any Prejudice to the Cu∣stoms of the Kingdom. For the same Reason it is, that he still remains on Board his Ship, and that he has brought no Men along with him. He does not apprehend that the Coronation of the Elector of Saxony can any way Pre∣judice his Right, according to the Maxim, That whatever is originally invalid, can never be of any force in the Con∣sequences that attend it. Hence it comes to pass, be∣sides the Irregularities of His Electoral Highness's Corona∣tion, that there is an indispensible Necessity, according to the Pacta Conventa, that the Electress should embrace the Roman Catholick Religion, before the Elector can be crown'd. He puts all his Confidence in the Poles, having a Design to avoid Effusion of Blood. But in case of Ne∣cessity, he Promises as many Forces as shall be necessary, and continues still dispos'd to spend his Estate, and to ex∣pose his own Person for the Polish Religion and Liberty.
But tho' this Stratagem had not the desired Effect, the new King did not defer the March of some of his Troops in∣to Prussia; where General Brandt was no sooner arrived, but he resolved to make the best advantage he could of the Confusion into which he found his Arrival had put the Prince of Conti's Affairs; So that November the 8th, march∣ing to Oliva with about 2000 Horse, he there surprized a Party of the Prince's, some of whom he put to the Sword, while of the rest he made an 100 Prisoners: The French Embassador, Polignac, narrowly escaped on Board du Bart's Squadron, where he found the Prince just ready to go a Shoar; So that he must have run a great hazzard of having been taken himself, had General Brandt deferred his march but two Hours longer, insomuch that finding himself now quite disappointed of his Hopes, he sail'd away on the 9th for France. But before his departure, we wrote two Letters, one to the Primate, wherein he acknowledged his wondrous Affection to his Interests, professed his great Concern for Po∣land's being subjected to Foreign Force, and of his being not able to succour them, and that the Revolt of the Lithuanian Army, at the Head of which he design'd to have put him∣self, with the Rigour of the Season, constrained his Return, he not having found one single Place in all Poland, that was willing to hold out for him. The other Letter was to the Republick, being full of Complaints, they should so fail of their Words to him, affront him in the Face of all Europe, to make him go so far to so ill Purpose, &c. And con∣cluded with assuring them, That if they stood in need of him, they might come and seek him in France, tho' at the same time he could not but pitty their Oppressions. Conti being thus gone, Saxony is left at full liberty to pur∣sue the remainder of his Game without Foreign Interrup∣tion; But he found it still enough, and too much, to Con∣flict with the Obstinacy of the Primate and other Factions, both in Poland and Lithuania, and no less than the Revolu∣tion of another Year has enabled him to put a final Period to it: But of this in its proper Place, it's time now we should return to the remaining Negotiations of the Peace at Ryswick. Yet first, we are to observe, that about the time of the Signing of the foremention'd Truce, between the Empire, and France, several Embassadors of the Allies, Princes, and States of the Empire, waited upon our King at Loo, where, notwithstanding the Conclusion of the fore∣said Treaties, an offensive, and defensive Alliance was whis∣pered to have been entred into, or rather renewed between the Allies; Where it was also Consulted, what manner of good Precautions ought to be used, to prevent the Violation of the Peace, now concluded, and how in case of Necessity every State should furnish such a Proportion of Men, and Money. And the Embassadors of the Empire happening to
Complain again, how much they were oppressed by an im∣mature Treaty, they were answered, That they ought im∣pute it to themselves, as being advised to put in their Complaints without delay. Besides, that it had been said before them more than once, that it was the Interest of the Empire to Retard the Treaties no longer; that they should not flatter themselves, that more favourable or advantagious Conditions could have been got thereby, since the French in∣sisted still upon the first, of which, they would retract no∣thing; that by consequence they ought to suffer, and not to blame; that which could not be done over again. So the Imperialists seeing it was in vain to Complain, had there been any just room for it, applied themselves to Adjust the remaining Points in Controversie with France, and the greatest difference seemed to be about Strasburg. It was also said, the Imperialists would have the Equivalent some∣what amplified, as also that besides , all the Place possest since the Peace of Nimeguen, should be restored, as also Fort Louis to the Duke of Lorrain. But the French le∣nipotentiaries had no Power to exceed their Orders, and therefore they could by no means comply with this De∣mand. The Imperialists hereupon would tye the French to the Performance of the Promise made by them in the Preliminaries, and which they had so often repeated after∣wards; and therefore it was not without reason that they maintained, that all that was odious, arising from the pro∣tracting of the Treaty, ought to light upon the French, and not upon the Imperialists, nor the Allies: But the French were positive in their last Proposals, as well as to the time they had limitted for the accepting of them; so that there was yet but little appearance of bringing things to a Final Accommodation. The Protestant Princes of the Empire shewed also the Zeal they had for the Interest of their Reli∣gion, and therefore being met together at the House of the Elector of Mentz's Embassador, they Named four Deputies, to wit, the Baron Bose, on the part of Saxony, Monsieu Schmettau for Brandenburg, Monsieur Snoki for the Dutchy of Deux Ponts, and Mounsier Bulpis for the Circle of Fran∣conia, who altogether delivered a Project to the Mediator, containing in Substance; that as to Strasburg (which now the Imperialists were inclinable to concede to France) and other Cities of Aisatia, which belonged to the French King, by vertue of former Treaties, the Lutheran Religion should be Tollerated, and enjoy all those Rights and Immunities it had in the Year, 1624. To which the French demanded eight Days to answer. But what misintelligence soever there▪ might appear to continue between them, and the Imperial Plenipotentiaries as to other Points; it plainly appeared they
agreed well enough, or rather Combined together to have the Popish Religion Exercised in the same state it was now in the respective Places that were to be delivered up, with∣out any notice taken of the Reformed at all, which made the Ministers of the Protestant Princes decline to Sign the Treaty when Concluded between them, and publish'd the following Declaration in the Protestants behalf. FRom the very moment that their Excellencies, his Im∣perial Majesty's Embassadors propos'd upon the 29th of October, as they had done the preceding Day, That their Excellencies, the French Embassadors, should require as an absolute Condition, That the following Clause should be in∣serted in the IVth▪ Article of the Treaty which regulates the Restitutions, viz. That the Roman Catholick Religion shall remain within the Places restor'd, in the same Condition as it is exercis'd at present; tho' this Article was read, and read over an infinite Number of times, and approv'd at length on both sides, yet the Embassadors and Plenipotentiaries of the Electors, Princes, and States of the Empire of the Ausburg Confession being here present, after they had exactly weigh'd and examin'd the Matter, have unanimously agreed that the said Clause is absolutly Opposite; I. To the Fundamental Laws of the Empire, that is to say, as well to the Peace of Religion, in the Year 1555. wherein it was agreed, That the Companions and Associates of the Ausburg Confession shall remain in the quiet Possession of the Ecclesiastical Estates and Rents belonging to 'em, and that they shall not be molested by any Process of Law upon that Occa∣sion, as more especially to the Peace of Westphalia, which ought to be look'd upon as the Basis and Foundation of this Treaty; For that the express Words of that Treaty are, That the sole and only Foundation of the Restitution, and of the performance which ought to follow it, by reason of the Ec∣clesiastical Affairs, ought to be the Year 1624. and respe∣ctively in the Palatinate, before the Commotions in Bohemia; till the Controversies about Religion shall be amicably ter∣minated. II. To the Capitulations of the Emperor, and the King of the Romans, whereby the Conclusion of the said Peace of Religion, and of the Peace of Westphalia, that follow'd it, are confirm'd. III. To the Instruction given to the Deputies of the Em∣pire at the present Treaty of Peace, which prescribes both to the One and the Other, as well Catholicks as Evange∣licks, after what manner they ought to Act. And for as much as the same Instruction was confirm'd by his Imperial Majesty, the Tenor of that Instruction is, That all things, as
well Ecclesiastical as Political, of which any Alteration may have been made, shall be restor'd to their first Condition, according to the Regulation of the Peace of Westphalia. IV. Moreover that Clause is contrary to the particular Instruction which the Deputies of the Confession of Ausburg have receiv'd from the Evangelick Body. V. To the particular Orders of their Masters tending to the same end. VI. To the Guarranty of the Peace of Westphalia, with which the Most Christian King is intrusted. VII. To the Preliminaries of that Peace, which were the Foundation of the Treaties that follow'd. VIII. To the Project, and Declaration which their Excel∣lencies, the Embassadors of France deliver'd the 20th of July, and 1st of September, wherein no mention is made of any such dangerous Alteration in the Peace of Westphalia. And when the said Embassie, some days before the Peace was sign'd, gave the Imperial Embassie their Choice to sign the Project and Declaration upon the Subject of the Peace, it ap∣pear'd by those two Pieces, as they are worded, and the same appear'd afterwards, that the Most Christian King had not then given any Order in reference to that Clause. IX. That Clause is also opposite to the preceding Article of the Peace of Ryswick, according to which the Treaties of Westphalia and Nimeguen are look'd upon as the Basis and Foundation of the present Peace; and because it is also ad∣ded, immediately after the Ratifications, the said Treaties be duly put in Execution, in respect of Spiritual and Temporal, and shall be inviolably observ'd for the future. For as to the Clause which is added, if it shall not be expresly derogated from it by the present Treaty, Certain it is, that it was only to be understood of the Temporal, and not of the Spiritual, as may be manifestly inferr'd from the Passage already cited, and by many others of the Westphalian Treaty. For it was there concluded, and more-especially in the Vth Article, Pa∣ragraph 9. of the Treaty of the Peace of Osnabrug, That they of the Confession of Ausburg should not be molested for the time to come, in any manner whatever, in the Possession of such E∣states of the Church which they enjoy'd; but that they should be for ever secure from all Prosecutions of Law and Violence, till the Contests about Religion should be determin'd. X. This Clause that has been already several times al∣ledg'd, is also contrary to the Separate Articles of the Trea∣ties past with the King of Great Britain, and the States-Ge∣neral of the United Provinces; by which His Sacred Impe∣rial Majesty, and the Empire, were left at liberty to con∣clude or not conclude the Peace, by a time prefix'd in the
Conditions, which had been stipulated in the Project and De∣claration of France. XI. Moreover such a Clause gives too great a Shog to the Union and Tye of Concord that reigns in all the States of the Empire. XII. And since his Imperial Majesty's Embassie has refus'd to take notice of the General Remonstrance of the Evange∣licks, concerning the Execution only of the III. Article of the Peace, because the said Execution in the Empire no way con∣cerns France, but only the Emperor and the Empire; XIII. Seeing also, that the Embassie of his Imperial Maje∣sty has not only refus'd to take any Cognizance of the par∣ticular Remonstrances of some of the Evangelicks, by which they desire to provide for the Re-establishment of their Re∣ligion, in the Provinces which are to be restor'd to the Ro∣man Empire, looking upon those Remonstrances as superflu∣ous, seeing they no way concern'd the Most Christian King, and as being already compriz'd under the Regulation of the III Article: Besides, that they rejected a General Remon∣strance of the Evangelicks, for the Preservation of the Evan∣gelick Religion, in the Cities of Strasburgh, and Alsatia, up∣on the Stipulations of the Peace of Westphalia; there is no reason that the Embassie of France should pretend the Ad∣mittance of this Clause, or that the Emperor's Embassie should admit it, and make an Alteration so contrary to the said Peace, in the Territories of the Empire, in reference to Ecclesiastical Affairs. XIV. The said Embassadors and Plenipotentiaries here pre∣sent, cannot give their Consent to the Clause so often men∣tion'd, contrary to their Orders and their Consciences, with∣out doing some notable Prejudice both to their Masters, and all the rest who uphold the Peace of Westphalia, and who are oblig'd to defend it; more-especially perceiving, upon read∣ing the Treaty of Ryswick after it was sign'd, that certain Things were inserted not only in this Article, but in several other Places, without their Knowledge; and at the same time omitted other things, which do not slightly concern the Evan∣gelicks, and of which Report will be made to the States of the Empire. XV. And tho' it was propos'd by way of Expedient, that the Evangelicks should sign the Treaty of Peace, in hopes the Affair would be accommodated, there were but Three who did it, having particular Reasons for so doing; the rest of the Embassadors and Plenipotentiaries refusing their Consent, as already has been said, because their Instructions expresly en∣joyn'd 'em the contrary, the Dispute being abot a Change of State, in regard of Ecclesiastick Affairs, within the Ter∣ritories of the Empire. And they thought they might the
better do it, because the Embassies of France had very often excus'd themselves, during the course of the Negotiation, be∣cause they had not his most Christian Majesty's Orders, in Things of less Importance. XVI. Thus after mature Deliberation, another Expedient was propounded; which was to defer signing the Treaty, till our Sovereigns should be inform'd of all things, and should declare themselves upon this Affair either at Ratisbonne, or at the Time of the Pacification. Now to the end that in an Affair of so much Delicacy, and of so high Importance, our Reasons may appear both now and for the future, in the Acts of the present Negotiation, We the Embassadors and Plenipotentiaries, whose Names are underwritten, earnestly desire their Excellencies, the Em∣bassadors Mediators, that this our Remonstrance may be in∣serted in their Protocol, or Register, and that they may have an Act given 'em to confirm the presenting it: Protesting also, at the same time, that their Masters are no less Zea∣lous for the Peace, then the rest of the Princes of Europe, and that it is great Grief to 'em, that they cannot sign in their Master's Name, by reason of a Difficulty that was no way foreseen. The Embassadors and Plenipotentiaries here present, have sign'd the present Declaration, and thereto fix'd their Seals, in the Names of the Electors, Princes and States of the S∣cred Roman Empire, of the Confession of Auspurg, who sent us their Deputies to the Treaty of Peace. At the Hague, 15th October, 4 November, 1697. In the Name of the Elector of Saxony, Christopher Dieteric Bose, the Younger. Dutchy of Deux Ponts, George Frederick de Snoilsky. Saxon Gota Adolph Christian Aveman. Duke of Bruns∣wick Zell, E. Klinggraffe. Landtgrave of Hesse-Cassel, William Vultesius. Elector of Bran∣denburgh, W. de Schmettau, N. E. L. B. de Danklman. Duke of, Sauon Coburg, Henry Richard, L. B. de Hagen. Margrave of ∣eith, E. L. B. de Stein.
Duke of Brunswick Wolfenbutel, John William de Mansberg. Dutchy of Hol∣stein, Gluckstar, Dethlevus Nicholus de Lewencron. But to return, the Conferences still continued at Ryswick, and all things were agreed on by the 30th of Oct. and the Treaty Signed then, being Two Days before the time limitted by France to accept of her Offers. The Articles were to this purpose, IN the Name of the most Holy Trinity, Amen—Be it known unto All, and every One, that a cruel War attended with the Effusion of much Christian Blood, and the Devastation of several Provinces, having been waged for some Years last past, between the most Serene and most Puissant Prince and Lord, Leopld, elected Emperour of the Romans, always Au∣gust, King of Germany, Hungary, Bohemia; of Dalmatia, Croa∣tia and Sclavonia; Archduke of Austri, Duke of Burgundy Brabant, Stiria, Carinthia and Carniola; Marquiss of Mora∣via; Duke of Luxemburg, of the Upper and Lower Silesia, of Wirtemberg, and of Teckay; Prince of Suabia; Coun of Hab∣bourg, of Tyrol, Kybourg, and Goritia; Marquiss of the Sacred Roman Empire, Burgaw, of the Upper and Lower Lusatia; Lord of the Sclavonian Marches, of Port-Naon, and Salins, &c. and the Sacred Roman Empire on one part; and the most Se∣rene and most Puissant Prince and Lord, Lewis XIV. the most Christian King of France and Navarre, on the other part. Now his Imperial Majesty, and his most Christian Majesty, having most seriously apply'd themselves to termi∣nate, and put an end as soon as possible to those Mischiefs that daily encreas'd, to the Ruine of Christendom, by the Divine Assistance, and by the Care of the most Serene and most Puissant Prince and Lord, Charles XI. King of Swede∣land, Goths and Vandls, Grand Prince of Finland, Duke of Scania, Esthonia, Livonia, of Carelia, Bremen, Perden, of Ste∣tin, Pomerania, Cassubia and Vandalia; Prince of Rgn, and Lord of Ingria and Wismar, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria, Juliens, Cves and Bergues, of Illustrious Memory; who from the very beginning of these Commoti∣ons, did not cease effectually to sollicit the Christian Princes to Peace, and afterwards having been accepted as Universal Mediator, never desisted gloriously to labour even to his dy∣ing Day, to procure the same with all imaginable speed; having to this purpose appointed and settled Conferences in the Palace of yswick in Holland: and after his Decease, the most Serene and most Puissant Prince and Lord Carles XII. King of Sweden, Goths and Vandls, Grand Prince of
Duke of Scania, Esthonia, of Livonia, Carelia, Bremen, of Fer∣den, Stetin, Pomerania, Cassubia, and of Vandalia; Prince of Rugen; Lord of Ingria and of Wismar; Count Palatine of the Rhine; Duke of Bavaria, Juliers, Cleves and Bergues; Inherit∣ing from his Royal Father the same longing Desire and Ear∣nestness to procure the publick Tranquility; and the Trea∣ties having been brought to their perfection by the foresaid Conferences; the Ambassadors and Plenipotentiaries law∣fully appointed and established by both Parties, being met to this effect at the aforesaid place; that is to say, on the Em∣peror's part, the most Illustrious and most Excellent Lords, the Sieur Dominic Andrew Kaunitz; Count of the Holy Ro∣man Empire, Hereditary Lord of Austerlitz, of Hungarischbord, Marischpruss and Orzechan the Great, Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, intimate Councellor of State to his Sacred Imperial Majesty, Chamberlain and Vice-Chancellour of the Holy Empire; the Sieur Henry John Stratman, Sieur de Puer∣bach, Count of the Holy Roman Empire, Lord of Oth, Schmi∣ding, Spatenbrun and Carlsberg, Imperial Aulique Councellor, Chamberlain to his Sacred Imperial Majesty; and the Siuer John Frederick, free and noble Baron of Seilern, Imperial A∣lique Councellor to his Sacred Imperial Majesty, and one of the Plenipotentiaries in the Imperial Diets: And on the part of his Sacred most Christian Majesty, the most Illustri∣ous and most Excellent Lords, the Sieur Nicholas August de Harlay, Knight, Lord of Boneuil, Count of Cely, Ordinary Councellor to the King in his Council of State: The Sieur Lewis Verjus, Knight, Ordinary Councellor to the King in his Council of State, Count de Crecy, Marquiss of Freon, Baron of Couvay, Lord of Boulay, of the two Churches of Fort-Isle, and other places; together with the Sieur Francis de Callieres, Lord of Callieres, of Rochechellay and Gigny; By the Mediation and Intercession of the most Illustrious and most Excellent Lords, the Sieur Charles Bonde, Count de Biornoo, Lord of Hesleby, Tyres, Toftaholm, of Graffteen, Gustavusberg, and of Rezitza, Councellor to his Majesty the King of Sweden, and President of the supreme Senate of Dorpat in Livonia; and of the Sieu Nicholas free Baron of Lillieroo, Secretary of State to his Ma∣jesty the King of Sweden, and Extraordinary Ambassador to their High and Mightinesses the States General of the United Provinces, both of them Extraordinary Ambassadors, and Plenipotentiaries for confirming and establishing a General Peace; who have faithfully discharg'd their Duty of Media∣torship with Integrity, Application, and Prudence: The Plenipotentiaries of the Electors, Princes, and deputed States of the Holy Roman Empire, being Present, Approving, and Consenting, after the Invocation of God's Holy Name, and the Exchange of their full Powers made in due manner and
form, did agree, for the Glory of God's Holy Name, and the Welfare of Christendom, upon Conditions of Peace and Con∣cord, the Tenor whereof is as followeth. I. THere shall be a Christian, Universal, Perpetual Peace, and a true Amity between his Sacred Imperial Ma∣jesty and his Successors, the whole Holy Roman Empire, and the Kingdoms and Hereditary States, their Vassals and Sub∣jects on the one part; It shall be faithfully and sincerely maintain'd, so that the one shall not undertake any thing under what Pretence soever, to the Ruin or Prejudice of the other, nor Afford, or Lend Assistance upon any account what∣soever to any one who would attempt it, or in any wise do any Wrong to the other; that he will not receive, protect, or assist in any way or manner whatsoever, the Rebellious and Disobedient Subjects of the other Party; but on the contra∣ry both Parties shall seriously procure the Benefit, Honour, and mutual Advantage of each other, notwithstanding all Pro∣mises, Treaties and Alliances to the contrary made, or to be made in any manner whatsoever, which are abolished, and made of none effect by the present Treaty. II. There shall be on both sides an Amnesty and perpetu∣al Oblivion of all the Hostilities reciprocally committed, in what place or manner soever it be; so that upon any Cause or Pretence of the same, or upon any other account, it may not be lawful for the one to express any Resentment to the other, nor create any Trouble or Vexation, directly or in∣directly, either by way of Justice, or de facto, in any place whasoever, nor permit that any such shall be expressed or created; but all and singular the Injuries and Violences whe∣ther by Word, Deed, or Writing, without any respect to Persons or Things, are so intirely and fully abolish'd and can∣cell'd, that whatsoever the one may pretend against the o∣ther upon this account, shall be bury'd in everlasting Obli∣vion; all and several the Subjects and Vassals of both Par∣ties shall enjoy the Effect and Benefit of the present Amnesty, insomuch that the having adhered to such or such a Party, shall not be wrested to the Prejudice or Disadvantage of any of them; but that he shall be wholly re-establish'd and settled, as to his Honours and Estate, in the same condition he was in immediately before the War, excepting notwithstanding what hath been more especially and particularly regulated in the following Articles, in relation to Moveables, Ecclesiasti∣cal Benefices and Revenues. III. The Treaties of Westphalia and Nimeguen shall be look'd upon as the Basis and Foundation of this present Treaty, and consequently in pursuance of the same, immediately upon the Exchange of the Ratifications, the said Treaties shall be ful∣ly
executed, in respect both to Spiritual and Temporal Mat∣ters, and shall be inviolably observed for the future, except in such Cases wherein it is expresly otherwise agreed on by this present Treaty. IV. Particularly there shall be deliver'd up to his Impe∣rial Majesty, to the Empire, and to its States and Members, all the Places and Rights situate out of Alsia, that have been in the possession of, and occupy'd and enjoy'd by, his most Christian Majesty, as well during the present War, by way of Fact and Deed, as by way of Unions and Reunions; or that have been exprest in the Catalogue of Reunions produced by the Ambassadors of France, nulling to this purpose all the Decrees, Determinations, Acts and Declarations made up∣on this account by the Chambers of Metz and Besancon, and by the Council of Brisac: and all things shall be reduced to the same Condition wherein they were before the foresaid Seisures, Unions, or Reunions, without putting the Possessors of the said Places to any further Trouble or Molestation, the Roman Catholick Religion nevertheless remaining settled in the fore-mentioned places, in the same manner as it is at present. V. And albeit by these general Rules one may easily judge who they be that are to be re-established, and in what man∣ner, and how far they ought to be so; nevertheless upon the earnest Sollicitations of some, and for some particular Rea∣sons, it hath been thought convenient to make particular mention of some Occasions; yet so, that those who shall not be expresly named, may not be taken for omitted, but shall absolutely enjoy the same Right, as those that are nominated, and may be put in the same Rank and Capacity. VI. Namely, the Elector of Triers, and Bishop of Spires, shall be re-invested in the Possession of the City of Triers or Treves, in the same Condition wherein it is at present, with∣out demolishing or damnifying any thing either in the pub∣lick or private Edifices, together with the Artillery that was therein, at the very time of its last being taken. In like manner, whatsoever was regulated in the IV. Article aforegoing upon the account of places occupied, of Unions and Re-unions, must be thought to be repeated in particular in favour of the Churches of Treves and Spires. VII. The Elector of Brandenbourgh, shall likewise enjoy all the Advantages of the present Peace, and shall be therein comprised together with all his Territories, Possessions, Sub∣jects and Rights, and more especially those that appertai and belong to him, by Virtue of the Treaty of the 29th of June; in the Year, 1679. just as if they had been specified each in particular.
VIII. All the States occupied and enjoyed by the most Christian King, shall be surrender'd to the Elector Palatine, whether they belong to him in particular, or whether he possesses them in common with others, of what nature soever they may be; and particularly the City, and Prefecture of Germersheim, together with the Prefectures, and Vice-Pre∣fectures therein comprised, with all the Fortresses, Cities, Burroughs, Towns, Villages, Hamlets, Fiefs, Funds and Rights, according as they were surrendred by the Peace of Westphalia, together with all Instruments, Instructions, and Acts taken away, or plunder'd from the Archives, or Records, Chancery, Court of Fiefs, from the Chamber of Counts, of Prefectures, and other Palatine Offices; not any Place, Ef∣fect, Right, or Document being excepted: and as to what relates to the Claims and Rights of the Dutchess of Oleans, it is agreed upon; that the aforesaid Restitution being first made; the usiness shall be decided, and judged in Form of Compromise by his Imperial Majesty, and by his most Chri∣stian: Majesty as Arbitrators, which shall be decided accord∣ing to the Imperial Laws and Constitutions. But if they do not agree in their Verdict, the Business shall be referr'd to the Pope, to judge of it as Supreme Arbitrator. Neverthe∣less they shall not forbear in the mean time endeavouring to procure an amicable Concord between the Parties, and till such time as the Businnss be determined and ended, the said Elector shall give every Year to the said Dutchess of Orleans, the Sum of Two hundred thousand French Livres, or One hundred thousand Florins of the Rhine, in such manner, and upon the same Condition as is specified by a particular Ar∣ticle of the same Power and Force as the present Treaty, and that the Right of the two Parties, as also that of the Em∣pire, shall remain intire, in respect of the Possessor as well as Pretender. IX. There shall be restored to the King of Sweden, in quality of Prince Palatine of the Rhine, the County of Spon∣eim, Valdents, his ancient Dutchy of Deux Ponts intire, and with all its Appurtenances, Dependences, and Rights, which the Counts Palatines of the Rhine, and Dukes of Deux Ponts, Predecessors of his Swedish Majesty, have enjoyed, or may have enjoyed, conformable to the Peace of Westphalia; so that whatsoever the Crown of France hath hitherto pretended to as to this Dutchy, in whole or in part, by what Title so∣ever, may rightfully return to his Swedish Majesty, and to his Heirs, as being Counts Palatines of the Rhine. There shall in like manner be restored all the Acts, Do∣cuments, Instructions, concerning the said Dutchy; together with the Artillery that was therein at the time when France
seized upon it, and all other Things agreed upon in the pre∣ceding Articles relating to Restitutions. X. As to what concerns the Principality of Veldents, and what the late Prince Leopold Lewis Count Palatine of the Rhine hath possest by virtue of the said Principality, or of that of Lautrec, it shall be restor'd in pursuance to the IV Article, and to the Inventory or List exhibited by the Am∣bassadors of France, saving only the Rights of each of the Pretenders as well in regard to the Possessor as to the Clai∣mer. XI. There shall be restored to Prince Francis Lewis Pala∣tine, Great Master of the Teutonick Order, and Bishop of Wormes, all the Commands wholly, without exception, taken by France from the said Order, and which have been assigned to him, or which he hath anciently possest, together with the Places, Revenues, and Rights; and the said Order shall enjoy, by vertue of the said Commands and Estates situate within the Dominion of France, as well in respect of Collation as Administration, the same Customs, Privileges, and Ex∣emptions that it enjoyed heretofore, according to its Statutes and Laws, and which the Order of St. John of Jerusalem were wnt to enjoy; likewise all that hath been decreed in relation to Restitutions of Places, Contributions, and otherwise, shall take place in behalf of the Bishop of Wormes, and of other Churches of the said Prince. XII. There shall be restored to the Elector of Cologne, in quality of Bishop and Prince of Liege, the Castle and City of Dinant, in the same Condition they were in, when the French possest themselves of them; together with all the Rights and Dependencies, and all the Artillery and Instru∣ctions that were found therein at that time: As for the rest, whatsoever hath been determined and regulated in the IVth Article in relation to what hath been taken by Unions and Re-unions, shall be look'd upon as repeated in particular in favour of the Churches of Cologne and Liege. XIII. The Family or House of Wirtemberg, and particu∣larly Duke George, shall be re-establish'd for him and his Successors, with respect to the Principality and County of Monbelliard, in the same Condition, Rights, and Preroga∣tives, and particularly the same immediate Dependence up∣on the Roman Empire, it hath heretofore enjoy'd, and which the Princes of the Empire did enjoy, or ought to have en∣joy'd; making void and of none effect all Acknowledgment in quality of Vassal made to the Crown of France in 1681. And they the said Princes shall henceforward freely enjoy all the Revenues that depend upon the said Principality and County, as well Secular as Ecclesiastick, that they enjoyed before the Peace of Nimeguen; as likewise all Fiefs that have
been opened in favour of them, or which they have made over or granted to others during the Detension of France; excepting only the Village of Baldenheim, together with the Appurtenances, which the Most Christian King hath be∣stowed on the Commander of Chamlay, Camp-Master-Gene∣ral to his Armies; which said Donation ought still to sub∣sist, yet in such a manner, notwithstanding, that Homage be paid to the foresaid Duke of Wirtemberg and his Succes∣sors, as to the direct Lord, and that he be oblig'd to beg of him to be invested in it. In like manner, the said Prin∣ces shall be reinstated in the full and free Possession as well of their Inheritance possest in Burgundy, of Clereval and Pos∣sevant, as of the Lordships of Granges, Herricourt, of Blamont, Chatelart, and of Clermont, and others situate and being in Burgundy, and in the Principality of Monbelliard, with all their Rights and Revenues, intire, and just in the same man∣ner as they possest them before the Peace of Nimeguen, abo∣lishing totally all that has been done and pretended to the contrary, under what Pretence, at what Time, and after what manner soever, it may be. XIV. In like manner, the Marquiss of Baden's Family shall enjoy all the Right and Benefit of the present Treaty; and consequently of that of Westphalia and Nimeguen, and and more particularly of the Fourth and Fifth Articles of the present Treaty. XV. The Princes and Counts of Nassaw, of Hanaw, and of Leininguen, and all other States of the Holy Roman Em∣pire, who are to be re-instated by the Fourth Article of this Treaty and others, shall likewise be re-instated accord∣ingly in all and several their Estates and Dominions, in the Rents and Revenues that depend thereon, and in all the other Rights and Benefits, of what nature soever they may be. XVI. And because, for the better securing and confirm∣ing the Peace, it hath been judged meet and expedient here and there to exchange some Countries, his Imperial Ma∣jesty and the Empire do yield up and grant to his Most Christian Majesty, and the Kings his Successors, the City of Strasburg, and all that depends thereon, on the left Hand of the Rhine, together with the whole Right, Propriety, and Sovereignty, that have belonged, or might have belonged to his said Imperial Majesty, and to the Roman Empire, till this present time; and do all and several of them transfer and make over to his Most Christian Majesty, and the Kings his Successors, in such sort that the said City with all its Ap∣purtenances and Dependancies situate and being on the left Hand of the Rhine, without all Exception, with the intire Jurisdiction, Superiority, and Sovereignty from this very
time, and for ever shall belong and appertain to His Most Christian Majsty and his Successors, and are united to, and Incorporated with the Crown of France▪ without any Con∣tradiction on the account of the Emperor, Empire, or of any other whatsoever; and for the greater Confirmation of the said Concession, and Allenation, the Emperor and Em∣pire, do expresly disclaim by vertue of this present Tran∣saction, the Decrees, Constitutions, Statutes and Customs of the Roman Empire, even tho' confirm'd by Oath, or that may hereafter be confirm'd, and particularly the Imperial Capitulation, inasmuch as it prohibits all manner of Aliena∣tion of the Estates and Rights of the Empire, all which they do absolutely and expresly renounce, discharging and free∣ing the said City, and all its Magistrates, Officers, Citizens and Subjects, from all their Bonds, Oaths and Engagements, whereby they have been obliged to the Emperor and Em∣pire, and permitting it to take an Oath of Supremacy and Allegiance to the Most Christian King, and his Successors, and by putting the Most Christian King into full and just pro∣perty, possession and Sovereignty, from this very time and for ever renouncing all Rights, Pretensions, and Claims to the same; and being willing to this effect that the said City of Strasburg be quite razed out of the Matriculation or Re∣gister of the Empire. XVII. It shall nevertheless be lawful for all, and every one of the Inhabitants of the said City and its Dependences, of what condition soever they be, who are willing to de∣part from thence, to go settle themselves in any other place where they please, and whither they may transport their Moveable Goods without any let, hindrance, diminution or exaction, during a whole Year next after the Ratification of the Peace, and during the space of five Years in executing the Conditions, which are wont to be perform'd from all Antiquity and Time out of Mind, in the said Countries in such like Cases; and may sell, or put off their Moveable Goods, or retain and keep them, and manage them them∣selves, or cause them to be governed and managed by o∣thers; the same liberty of keeping and managing their Im∣movable Goods themselves, or of getting them managed by others, shall appertain to any other Member or Subject of the Empire, be they mediate or immediate, who shall have any Goods, Revenues, Debts, Actions or Rights with∣in the said City and Dependences thereon, whether it be that they have always enjoy'd them, or whether they may have been confiscated during, or before the War, or given to others, the which ought to be restor'd by the present Agreement of what nature soever they may be, or in what place soever they may be situate; provided also that the
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction shall remain to those whereunto it did from all Antiquity belong; and without any body pre∣suming to withstand the same, or hinder the exercise there∣of. XVIII. In like manner also His Most Christian Majesty shall on his part restore within thirty days next ensuing the Ra∣tification of the present Treaty, to his Imperial Majesty and Empire, the Fort of Kiel, together with all and singular its Rights and Dependences, which first was built by His Most Christian Majesty, on the right Hand of the Rhine intire, and without demolishing any thing thereof. And as for the Fort of Pille, and others raised in the Isles of the Rhine, they shall be totally razed within a Month, or sooner, if possible, at the sole Expence and Charges of the Most Christian King, and not to be new raised, or rebuilt hereafter by either Party. And as to what relates to the Navigation, and other Usage, and Customs of the River, it shall be free, and open for the Subjects of both Parties, and for all other that shall have a mind to pass, sail, or convey their Merchan∣dize that way; without any permission being allowed to ei∣ther of them to undertake any thing there or else-where, for to turn the said River another way, and thereby any ways to render the Course of Navigation, or any other Usage or Custom more difficult; much less shall it be per∣mitted to erect new Customs, Rights, Imposts, or Tolls, or to augment the ancient ones; to oblige the Boats to come ashore at one Bank rather than other, there to expose their Lading or Merchandize, or to take in any; but all that shall be wholly left to every ones Liberty. XIX. His Most Christian Majesty does likewise deliver up to his Imperial Majesty, and to the Most Serene House of Austria, the City and Fortress of Friburg, as also the Fort of St. Peter, and the Fort called the Fort Del' estoile, or Star, and all the other Forts newly erected, or repaired there or elsewhere in the Black Fonest, or in any other part of Bris∣gow, every one of them in the self-same Condition wherein it remains at present, without demolishing or damnifying any thing, together with the Villages of Leken, Mertzhauzen, and Kirchzarth, with all their Rights thereunto belonging, as they were yielded up to His Most Christian Majesty by the Peace of Nimeguen, or possessed, occupied or enjoy'd by him, together with all the Archives, Records, and all and every the Documents or Writings found therein, at the time his said Majesty was put in possession of the same, whether they be still in the places, or convey'd else-where; always reserving without prejudice the Dioesan Right, with other Rights and Revenues of the Bishop of Constans.
XX. In like manner His Most Christian Majesty delivers and conveys to his Imperial Majesty, the City of Brisac whol∣ly in the Condition it now is, with the Granaries, Arsenals, Fortifications, Ramparts, Walls, Towers, and other Edi∣fies, both publick and private, as also the Dependences si∣tuate on the right Hand of the Rhine, leaving to the Most Christian King, those which are on the left, and among o∣thers, the Fort called the Mortar. But that which is called the New City, situate, and being on the left Hand of the said River, with the Bridge, and Fort built in the Isle of the Rhine, shall be totally demolished and razed, never more to be rebuilt by the one party or the other. More-over, the same Liberty of removing from Brisac to any other place, which was agreed upon as to the City of Strasburg, must be considered as repeated in this place word for word. XXI. The foresaid Places, Cities, Castles, and Fortresses, together with all their Jurisdictions, Appurtenances, and Dependences made over and deliver'd to his Imperial Ma∣jesty, by His Most Christian Majesty, shall be surrendred, and deliver'd without any reservation, exception, or deten∣tion whatsoever, faithfully and honestly, without any delay, lett, hindrance or pretence to such who after the Ratifica∣tion of the present Treaty shall be appointed, or in a more special manner deputed to that effect by his Imperial Ma∣jesty, or have made it appear to the French Intendants, Governours, or Officers of the Places so to be delivered; insomuch that the said Cities, Cittadels, Forts and Places, with all their Priviledges, Emoluments, Revenues, and Im∣munities, and all other things whatsoever contained therein, may return to be under the Jurisdiction, actual Possession, and absolute Power and Sovereignty of his Imperial Ma∣jesty, and the House of Austria; and may so remain for ever-more, as they belonged to him in former times, and have been hitherto possest by His Most Christian Majesty; the Crown of France not retaining or reserving to it self any Right, Claim, or Pretension to the fore-mention'd Places and their Jurisdiction. Neither shall they demand the Cost and Charges expended in the Fortifications, or other pub∣lick or private Edifices, nor shall the full and intire Resti∣tution be put off and deferred, for any Reason whatsoever, from being performed within thirty days next after the Ra∣tification of this present Treaty, so that the French Garri∣sons may depart thence without causing any Molestation, Damage, or Trouble to the Citizens and Inhabitants, or any other Subjects of the House of Austria whatsoever, un∣der pretence of Debts, or what pretensions soever. Neither shall it be permitted to the French Troops to stay any longer time in the Places that are to be restor'd, or any
other place not belonging to His Most Christian Majesty, there to take up their Winter-Quarters, or sojourn therein; but shall be forced immediately to repair to the Territories belonging to the Crown of France. XXII. There shall be likewise restored to his Imperial Majesty, and the Holy Roman Empire, the Town of Philips∣burg in its best Condition, with the Fortifications adjoining thereto, that are on the right Hand of the Rhine, and all the Ordinance and Artillery that was there when France seiz∣ed on it the last time; with this Proviso, That the Right of the Bishop of Spires be altogether excepted, upon the ac∣count of which the fourth Article of the Treaty of Peace at Nimeguen is to be look'd upon as repeatable in this place in express Terms. But the Fort that was built on the Left side of the Rhine, and the Bridge that was made by the Most Christian King's Order after the taking of it, shall be utter∣ly demolished. XXIII. The Most Christian King shall take care to cause the Fortifications built over against Hunningen upon the Right side in the Isle of the Rhine, to be razed at his own proper Cost and Charges, restoring the Grounds and Edifices to the Fa∣mily of Baden: The Bridge also built in this place upon the Rhine, shall be demolish'd likewise. XXIV. They shall likewise destroy the Fort that was built on the Right side of the Rhine, over against the Fort called Fort Louis, the said Fort and Isle remaining in the Power of the Most Christian King, and as for the Ground of the demo∣lish'd Fort, it shall be restored together with the Houses to the Marquess of Baden. They shall more-over destroy that part of the Bridge that goes from the said Bridge to the Isle, which shall never be repaired hereafter by either Party. XXV. The Most Christian King shall likewise cause to be demolish'd the Fortifications added after the Peace of Ni∣meguen, to the Castle of Trarbach, and the Fortress of Mont∣royal upon the Moselle, without any Body's presuming to repair them for the future, yet leaving the Fortress of Trar∣bach intire to be wholly restored, with the City and its Ap∣purtenances to its former Possessors. XXVI. They shall likewise demolish the Fortifications ad∣ded by the Most Christian King, to the Fortress of Kern∣burg, after which demolishing, the City of Kernburg being left intire and untouched, as also the other Goods and Chattels belonging to the Prince of Salm, and to his Cou∣sins the Rhinegraves, and Vildgraves, and other things, shall be restored to be possessed in the same manner, and with the very same Right they did possess them before they were
turn'd out of them. Upon which it is agreed and consent∣ed to by the present Treaty. XXVII. The New Fortifications added by the Most Chri∣stian King, to the Fortress of Ebernburg, shall also be de∣molished, and the Fortress to be afterwards restored to the Barons of Sickenguen, with other Estates belonging to them, which are to be restored to them by both Par∣ties. XXVIII. The Duke of Lorrain having been united to his Imperial Majesty in this War, and having a desire to be comprehended within this present Treaty, he shall be ac∣cordingly re-instated for himself, his Heirs, and Successors, into the free and full Possession of the States, Possessions, and Goods which Duke Charles his Uncle by the Father's Side, was possest of in the Year, 1670. at such time as the Most Christian King seized upon them; excepting notwith∣standing the Alterations and Changes explain'd in the fol∣lowing Articles. XXIX. His Most Christian Majesty shall particularly re∣store to the said Duke the Old and New City of Nancy, with all its Appurtenances, and the Artillery that was found in the Old City at the time of its being taken; upon this Con∣dition nevertheless, That all the Ramparts and Bastions of the Old City remaining intire, with the Gates of the New, the Ramparts and Bastions of this latter, as also the whole exteriour Fortifications of both, shall be intirely razed at the sole Charge of the Most Christian King, never to be any more re-built for time to come: Except the said Duke and his Successors shall have a mind when they please to en∣close the New City with a single dry Wall, without a Flank. XXX. His Most Christian Majesty shall likewise cause the Castle of Bitsch to be evacuated, with all its Appurte∣nances; as also the Castle of Homburg, by causing all the Fortifications to be razed before-hand, that they may never more be repaired; yet so that the foresaid Castles and Cities that are adjacent thereto, may receive no Damage there∣by, but may remain totally untouch'd. XXXI. Upon the whole, Whatsoever hath been ordered as above-said in the IVth Article, in reference to Unions and Re-unions, shall be as serviceable and advantageous to the said Duke, as if it had been here repeated verbatim, in what Place and after what Manner the foresaid Unions and Re-unions have been made and ordained. XXXII. His Most Christian Majesty reserves to himself the Fortress of Saar-Louis, with half a League round about it, which shall be marked out and limitted by the Commissioners
of his said Majesty, and by those of Lorrain, by him to be possess'd Sovereignly for ever. XXXIII. The City and Prefectship of Longwi, together with all its Appurtenances and Dependences, shall also re∣main in the Power of the said Most Christian King, his Heirs and Successors, with all Superiority, Sovereignty and Pro∣perty, without the said Duke his Heirs or Successors pre∣tending henceforward to claim any Right therein; but in exchange of the said City and Prefectship, his said Most Christian Majesty will put another Prefectship into the Hands of the said Duke, in one of the three Bishopricks, of the same Extent and Value, whereof the said Commissioners shall bona fide agree upon. And the said Prefectship so made over and conveyed by the Most Christian King to the said Duke, he the said Duke, as well as his Heirs and Successors, shall possess it to the Words end, with all the Rights of Superiori∣ty, Sovereignty and Property. XXXIV. The Passage shall be always open through the Territories of the said Duke, without any Obstacle or Im∣peachment, to the Most Christian King's Troops, who shall go or come from the Frontiers; upon Condition neverthe∣less, that timely Notice of it shall be given before-hand; that the Soldier that passes shall not go out of his Way, but may pursue the shortest and usual Way, and duly con∣tinue his Road as he ought, without delay. He shall not commit any Violence, nor do any Damage to the Places and Subjects of the Duke, and shall pay ready Money for Vi∣ctuals and other Necessaries that shall be delivered to him by the Commissioners of Lorrain. Mutually abolishing and causing the High-ways and Places that his Most Christian Majesty had reserved to himself by the Peace of Nimeguen, to return to the Power and Jurisdiction of the Duke without any Exception. XXXV. The Ecclesiastical Benefices conferred by his Most Christian Majesty till the very day of the present Treaty, shall remain in the Enjoyment and Possession of those who pos∣sess them at present, and who have obtained them of his Most Christian Majesty, without being liable to be disturbed therein. XXXVI. It hath more-over been concluded, That the Law-Suits, Sentences, and Decrees passed by the Council, Judges, and other his Most Christian Majesty Officers con∣cerning the Differences and Actions that have been deter∣mined as well between the Subjects of the Dutchies of Lor∣rain and of Barr, as others, at the time when the most Chri∣stian King possest those States, shall take place and obtain their full and due effect, in the same manner as if his said Christian Majesty had remained in full Possession of his said
Estates, it not being permitted to call in question the va∣lidity of the said Sentences and Decrees, or to impede or stop the Execution thereof. It shall notwithstanding be permitted to the Parties to demand a Review of what shall have been enacted according to the Order and Disposition of the Laws and Constitutions, the Sentences nevertheless remaining in their full Force and Vertue. XXXVII. There shall be restored to the said Duke, af∣ter the Ratification of the present Treaty, the Archives and written Documents and Presidents that was in the Trea∣sury of the Records of Nancy and Barr, and in both Cham∣bers of Accounts or other places, and that have been taken thence. XXXVIII. The said Duke immediately after the Ratifi∣cation of the Peace, shall have Power to send Commission∣ers to the Dutchies of Lorrain and Barr, to have a watch∣ful Eye upon his Affairs, Administer Justice, take care of the Imposts, Taxes upon Salt, and other Duties, dispose of publick Treaties, and perform all other necessary things, so that the said Duke may within the same time enter into the full possession of his Government. XXXIX. As to what relates to Imposts and Customs, and concerning the Exemption in the Transportation of Salt or Wood, either by Land or Water, the Custom settled in the Year 1670. shall be observed, without permitting any Inno∣vation. XL. The ancient Custom and Liberty of Commerce be∣tween Lorrain and the Bishopricks of Mez, Toul, and Verd, shall be still in being, and shall henceforth be observed to the Benefit and Advantage of both Parties. XLI. The Contracts and Agreements made between the Most Christian Kings and the Dukes of Lorrain, shall be in like manner observed in their ancient Force and Vi∣gour. XLII. The said Duke and his Brethren shall be impower∣ed to prosecute the Right they pretend to belong to then in divers Causes, by the ordinary Course of Law, notwith∣standing the Sentences past in their absence, without being heard. XLIII. In Matters not here expresly agreed to the co∣trary, shall be observed in respect of the Duke, his Estates and Subjects, what hath been concluded upon by the present Treaty, and more especially in the Article that begins, Is the XLVI All the Vassals and Subjects of both Parties: In that which begins,Is the L. So soon as the present Treaty of Peace shall be: And that which beginneth,Is the LI. And to the end that the Subjects of both Parties may as speedily as may be enjoy: Just as if they had been here particularly recited.
XLIV. The Cardinal of Furstemburg shall be re-invested in all the Rights, Estates, Feudal and Allodial, Benefices, Honours and Prerogatives, that belong to the Princes and Members of the Holy Roman Empire, as well in respect of the Bishoprick of Strasburg, on the Right-hand of the Rhine, as of the Abby of Stevelo and others; and shall enjoy, with his Cousins and Relations that adhered to his Party, and his Domestick Servants, a full and absolute Amnesty, and Security, for whatsoever hath been done or said, and for whatsoever hath been decreed against him or them; and that neither He, his Heirs, Cousins, Relations, nor Dome∣sticks, shall ever be proceeded against in any Cause by the Lords Electors of Cologne and Bavaria, their Heirs, or any other Persons whatsoever, upon the account of the Inheri∣tance of the late Maximilian Henry: And reciprocally, the Lord Cardinal, his Cousins, Relations, and Domesticks, or any that have any Cause depending upon their Behalf, shall not demand any thing, upon what account soever, from the Lords Electors, or others, from the said Inheritance, Lega∣cies that were left them, or any Things that have been gi∣ven them, all Right, Pretension, or Action Personal or Real, being totally extinct. Such of the Canons who have ad∣hered to the Cardinal's Party, and who have been outed of their Prependaries, or Canonical Benefices, shall receive the same Amnesty and Security, and shall make use of the same Privilege, and shall be re-settled in all the Canonical Rights, Benefices, and Dignities, and in the same Degree and Dig∣nity in the Chapter of the Collegiate Churches and Cathe∣dral Church, as they were before their Deposition. Yet so however, that the Revenues remaining in the Power of those that possess them at present, these same may enjoy, just as the others that shall be re-settled do, the Titles and com∣mon Functions of the said Dignities and Benefices; the Chief Place and Rank notwithstanding is to be deferr'd, and yielded to those who shall be re-settled; and after Death, or the voluntary Resignation of those who are in Possession, those only that are re-established shall solely enjoy the said Dignities and Revenues; and in the mean time, each of them, according to the Order they have among them, shall obtain the new Prebendaries that shall become vacant. And there is no question but this may be approved of by the above-said Ecclesiasticks whom this Regulation may concern. The Heirs likewise of the Canons who have been deprived of their Dignity, and are dead during the War, whose Goods, Chattels and Revenues have been sequestred or confiscated, shall enjoy the intire Benefit, for the Recovery of them by the Article which begins thus,It is the XLVI. All the Vassals and Subjects of both Parties; together with this express and particular Clause,
That Pious Legacies bequeath'd by the Deceased, shall be paid forthwith, without delay, according to their Disposal, out of the Revenues by them assigned. XLV. The Landgraves of Hesse Reinfeldt shall be in a more especial manner included in the Amnesty, and shall be re∣instated in respect of the Fortress of Reinfeldt, and all the Lower Country of Catzenelboguen, with all Rights and De∣pendences, in the same Condition and Circumstances where∣in, the Landgrave Ernest their Father was, before the be∣ginning of this War: Excepting always, and in all Cases, the Rights appertaining to Monsieur the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel. XLVI, All the Vassals and Subjects of both Parties, Ec∣clesiasticks and Seculars, Corporations, Universities and Col∣leges, shall be re-settled in their Honours, Dignities, and Be∣nefices, whereof they were in quiet Possession before the War, as also in all their Rights, Goods moveable and im∣moveable, Rents and Revenues; also those that are capa∣ble of being redeemed, or which are for Life, (provided that the Principal thereof be not consumed) and have been em∣ployed or retained during or upon the Occasion of this War, with all the Rights, Actions, Successions, and Entails that are fallen to them during the said War; yet so, that they may not demand any thing back again upon occasion of Fruits or Revenues received, or Pensions granted after the taking or detaining, until the Day of the Ratification of the present Treaty. Provided nevertheless, that Merchandize, Debts, and Moveables, shall not be re-demanded, if confis∣cated during, or upon account of the War, or converted to other Uses by publick Authority; nor shall the Creditors of the said Debts, and Moveables, or their Heirs or Execu∣tors, ever sue for them, nor pretend to any Restitution or Satisfaction for them. The said Restitutions shall also ex∣tend to those who have followed a contrary Party, who have thereupon been suspected, and who have been deprived of their Estates after the Peace of Nimeguen, for having absent∣ed themselves, to go to inhabit elsewhere, or because they have refused to pay Homage, or such like Causes or Preten∣ces; which said Persons consequently, by virtue of this Peace, shall return into their Prince's Favour, and into all their an∣cient Rights and Estates whatsoever, such as they are at the time of the Conclusion and Signing of this Treaty; and all that hath been said in this Article, shall be executed imme∣diately after the Ratification of the Peace, notwithstanding all Donations, Concessions, Alienations, Declarations, Con∣fiscations, Faults, Expences, Meliorations, interlocutory and definitive Sentences, past out of Contumacy and Contempt, the Persons absent not being heard to speak for themselves;
which said Sentences shall be null, and of none effect, and look'd upon as though they had never been pronounc'd; they, all of them, being left to their Liberty to return in∣to their Country, to enter upon their aforesaid Estates, and enjoy them, as well as their Rents and Revenues, or to go, sojourn and take up their Habitation elsewhere, in what place they shall think fit, and such as they have a mind to make Choice of, without any Violence or Constraint. And in such a Case it shall be permitted to them to cause their Estates and revenues to be administred by Sollicitors, or Proctors, that are not suspected, and may peaceably enjoy them; excepting only Ecclesiastical Benefices, that require Residence, which shall be regulated and administred perso∣nally. Lastly, It shall be free for every Subject of either Party to sell, exchange, alieniate, and convey by Testament, Deed of Gift, or otherwise, their Estates, Goods, moveable and immoveable, Rents and Revenues, which they may possess in the States or Dominions of another Sovereign; so that any ones Subject, or a Foreigner, may buy them, or purchase them, without having need of further Permission from the Sovereign, besides that which is contained in this present Article. XLVII. If any Ecclesiastical Benefices mediate, or imme∣diate have been during this War conferr'd by one of the Parties in the Territories and Places that were under his Dominion, upon Persons qualified, according to the Canon or Rule of their first Institution, and the Lawful Statutes general or particular made on this behalf, or by any other Canonical disposal made by the Pope. The said Ecclesiastical Benefices shall be left to the present Possessors, as likewise the Ecclesiastical Benefices conferr'd after this manner be∣fore this War, in the Places that ought to be restored by the present Peace; so that henceforth no Person may, or ought to trouble or molest them in the Possession and law∣ful Administration of the same; neither in receiving the Fruits and Benefits, nor upon that account may they at any time be presented, summoned, or cited to appear in a Court of Judicature, or any other way whatsoever, disturb∣ed or molested: Upon condition notwithstanding that they discharge themselves honestly, and perform what they are bound to by vertue of the said Benefices. XLVIII. Forasmuch as it conduceth much to the publick Peace and Tranquility, that the Peace concluded at Turin, the 29th of August, 1696. between his Most Christian Ma∣jesty, and his Royal Highness, be exactly and duly observed, it hath likewise been found expedient to confirm it, and to comprise it in this present Treaty, and to make it of the same Value, and for ever to subsist and be in Force. The
Points that have been regulated in favour of the House of Savoy, in the Treaties of Westphalia and Nimeguen re-esta∣blished above, are confirmed in particular, and judged as here repeated word for word; yet so nevertheless, that the Restitution of Pignerol and its Dependences, already made, may not in any case diminish or alter the Obliga∣tion wherein his Most Christian Majesty hath engaged him∣self to pay to the Duke of Mantua the Sum of Four hundred ninety four thousand Crowns, for discharge of the Duke of Savoy, as is explained more at large in the Treaty of the Peace of Westphalia. And to the end that this may be more fully and more strongly confirmed, All, and every One, the Princes, that participate of the General Peace, do pro∣mise to the Duke of Savoy, and will reciprocally receive from him the Promises and Securities, that they stipulate among themselves for a more firm Assurance of the Mat∣ter. XLIX. Upon the whole, it is not meant that by what∣soever Restitution of Places, Persons, Estates, Rights made or to be made by France, there is acquired any new Right to such as are, or shall be so re-establish'd. But that if any other have any Claim or Pretension against them, they shall be propounded, examined and decided in a convenient place, after the making of the said Restitution, which for this reason ought by no means to be deferred. L. So soon as ever the present Treaty of Peace shall have been Signed and Sealed by the Lords Extraordinary Ambas∣sadors and Plenipotentiaries, all Hostilities and Violence of what Nature soever shall cease, as also all demolishing of Edifices, all Devastations of Vineyards and Forests, all fel∣ling of Trees; immediately after the Exchange of the Ra∣tifications, all the Troops shall be made to retire from the unfortified Places belonging to the other Party. And as for what concerns fortified Places that are to be restored by the present Treaty, they shall within Thirty days after the Ra∣tification of the Peace, or sooner, if possible, be surrendred to and put into the Hands of those that are nominated in the preceding Articles; or, if not expresly nominated, then to those who did possess them immediately before their be∣ing taken; without any demolishing of Fortifications or Edi∣fices, either publick or private, without making them in a worse Condition than they are at present, or without ex∣acting any thing for or by reason of any Expences in the said Places; and the Soldiers shall not exact any thing upon this account, or for any other cause whatsoever, nor carry any thing away of the Effects belonging to the Inhabitants, or of what ought to be left there in pursuance of this Trea∣ty. As for all sorts of Demolitions to be made pursuant to
the Agreements above, it shall be wholly and effectually performed, in respect of the less considerable things, with∣in a Month if possible, and in respect of the more conside∣rable within two Months if it may be done, without any Expence or Trouble to the other Party for the said Demo∣lition. Likewise shall all the Archives, Records, Literal Docu∣ments be faithfully restored immediately after the Exchange of the Ratifications, as well those which belong to the Pla∣ces that are to be surrendred and deliver'd to his Imperial Majesty's Empire, and to its States and Members, as those that have been remov'd and convey'd from the Chamber and City of Spires, and other places of the Empire, altho' there may be no particular mention made thereof in the present Treaty. The Prisoners taken upon occasion of the War, shall also be releas'd, and set at liberty on both sides, without any Ransom, and in particular such who have been condemned to the Gallies, or to any other publick Slave∣ry. LI. And to the end that the Subjects of both Parties may speedily enjoy the intire Benefit of this Peace, it hath been agreed, That all Contributions of Money, Grain, Wine, of Forage, Wood, and Cattel, or the like, altho' already im∣pos'd on the Subjects of the other Party, and altho' they have been settled and stated by Agreement; as also, that all Foraging of what nature soever, upon the Territories and Jurisdiction of one another, shall totally cease upon the very day of the Ratification, and what shall be due in Arrears for such like Contributions, Impositions or Exactions, shall be totally abolish'd. In like manner the Hostages delivered or carried away during this War, for what cause soever, shall be restor'd, without farther delay, and that without be∣ing oblig'd to pay any thing for the same. LII. In like manner the Commerce prohibited during the War between the Subjects of his Imperial Majesty and the Empire, and those of his Most Christian Majesty, and of the Realm of France, shall be re-establish'd presently after the Signing of this Peace, with the same liberty as before the War, and shall, All, and every One of them, and more particularly the Inhabitants and Citizens of the Hans-Towns, Enjoy all manner of Security by Sea and Land, together with their Ancient Rights, Immunities, Privileges and Ad∣vantages obtained by Solemn Treaties, or by Ancient Cu∣stom. LIII. Whatsoever is concluded and agreed upon by this Treaty shall be firm and inviolable to perpetuity; and shall be observed and put in execution notwithstanding whatsoever might have been believed, alledged, or imagined to the con∣trary;
which remains altogether cancelled and abolished, altho' it might be of such a nature, that we might have been obliged to make a more ample and more particular mention of the same; or, altho' the cancelling and abrogation seem as if it ought to be lookt upon as null, invalid, and of none effect. LIV. Each of the Stipulating contracting Parties shall be capable of confirming this present Peace, and his observance of it, by certain Alliances, by Fortifications upon his own proper Ground, except in the Places in especial manner above excepted, the which they may build, or inlarge, put Gar∣risons into, and use other means they shall judge most ne∣cessary for their defence. It shall likewise be permitted as well to all the Kings, Princes and Republicks in General: As to the King of Sweden in particular as Mediator, to give their Guarantie to his Imperial Majesty and Empire, and to his Most Christian Majesty, just as it was by vertue of the Peace of Westphalia. LV. And forasmuch as his Imperial Majesty and the Em∣pire, and his Most Christian Majesty do acknowledg with Sentiments of Gratitude, the continual Cares and good Offices, that his Swedish Majesty hath used for re-establishing the Pub∣lick Tranquility, both Parties agree that his Swedish Maje∣sty shall by name be comprehended in the present Treaty, with his Realms and Dominions, in the best form and man∣ner as possibly may be. LVI. There are also comprehended in the present Treaty upon the behalf of his Imperial Majesty and the Empire, be∣sides the Members of the Empire already named, the other Electors, Princes, States and Members of the Empire, and among others more especially the Bishop and Bishoprick of Basil, with all his Estates, Privileges and Rights: Item, the thirteen Swisse Cantons, together with their Confederates, namely with the City of Geneva, and its Dependences, the City and County of Neufchatel, the Cities of St. Gall, Mul∣bausen and Bienne, the three Grison Leagues, the Seven Ju∣risdictions or Dizaines of the Vallais, as also the Abbey of St. Gall. LVII. On the part of his Most Christian Majesty are in like manner comprised the thirteen Cantons of Switzerland, and their Allies, and namely the Republick of Vallais, or Wallisland. LVIII. There shall also be comprehended within this Trea∣ty all such who shall be named by common consent of the one, and the other party before the Exchange of the Ratifications, or within the space of six Months after.
LIX. The Ambassadors of his Imperial Majesty, and of the Most Christian King, conjointly with the Plenipotentiaries of the States deputed by the Empire, do promise to cause the present Peace thus concluded by the Emperour, the Em∣pire and King of France, to be ratified in that same form whereof it is interchangeably here agreed on, and to procure the Exchange of the Letters of Ratifications in this same place, within the space of six Weeks to begin to reckon from this very Day, or sooner if possible. LX. In Witness and confirmation whereof the Extraordinary Ambassadors and Plenipotentiaries as well Imperial as those of the King of France, as also the Plenipotentiaries of the Electors, and Deputies from the States of the Empire have to this effect subsigned this present Treaty with their own Hands, and have annexed their Seals thereto.

FOR the clearer Explanation of the eighth Article of the Treaty of Peace this Day Signed, which Article begins thus, All the States possest by the most Christian King shall be re∣stored to the Elector Palatine, It hath been thought convenient to resolve over and above, that this Order will be observed in the Proposal of the Claims and Rights of Madame the Dutchess of Orleans exhibited against the Elector Palatine; at such time as the Arbitrators shall be agreed at the time appointed for the Ratification of the Peace about a Place to meet in, this Place shall be notified to each Party. The De∣puties on the Arbitrators part shall be sent thither within the space of two Months, to reckon from the very time the Elector Palatine shall be fully re-established; in conformity to the Article above-mention'd. In the Month following shall the said Lady Dutchess produce in the same place, the whole and intire explanation of her Pretensions or Demands against the Elector, which shall be communicated to him within eight Days following. There shall be within the space of four Months next ensuing, explain'd and delivered to the Deputies of the Lords Arbitrators, who shall set down the day that the four Months shall begin, the Reasons and Grounds of the two Parties, wherof four Copies shall be delivered; that is to say, one for each Arbitrator, and a third to be annext to
the common Acts of the Arbitration, and a fourth to be inter∣changeably communicated within seven Days to each Par∣ty. They shall in like manner answer; and four Copies of the Answer of each Party shall be given the same Day to the Envoys of the Lords Arbitrators, which shall be once more communicated within seven Days to the Parties inter∣changeably. In the four Months following, the Instruction of the Business shall be terminated on each side, the Parties shall declare they are willing to submit to the Verdict of the Arbitrators, and this conclusion of the Instruction and Commission shall be communicated to the Parties, that they may take cognisance of the same; and the Deeds shall be Enrolled in presence of the Solicitors of the said Parties. Af∣ter that the Arbitrators and their Deputies who shall have taken an Oath, having viewed and examined the Right of the Parties during the space of six Months ensuing, shall pro∣nounce their Sentence publickly in the place where the Con∣ference is held, according to the Laws and Constitutions of the Empire; now if it be found conformable it shall be ef∣fectually put in execution; but if so be the Arbitrators or their Deputies do not agree in their Verdict, the common Acts of the Arbitration shall be conveyed to Rome at the joint Charges of the Parties, and that within the space of two Months, beginning at the Day next ensuing the Judgment given, and shall be delivered to the Pope as Supreme Ar∣bitrator, to be committed by him for its Examination with∣in six Months more to Deputies, no way suspected by the Parties, who shall likewise be sworn, and these same upon the former Proceedings (it not being allowed to the Parties to draw up a new Declaration of their Titles) shall pronounce within the space of six Months next ensuing, and as it hath been said, conformable to the Laws and Constitutions of the Empire, the last Definitive Sentence, which cannot be nul∣led or made void, but the Lord Arbitrators shall cause to be executed without any delay or contradiction. Now if so be one of the Parties demurr, and delay to propound, ex∣plain and prove his Title and Right within the time required, it shall nevertheless be lawful for the other Party to explain and deduce his Title within the time prefixt, which may never be prolonged; and lawful also for the Arbitrators and Supreme Arbitrator to proceed according to the method just now explain'd, and to pronounce and execute their Sentence, according to the Acts and Deeds produced and proved. Notwithstanding this procedure, the Parties themselves, and the Lords Arbitrators on their part shall not cease at∣tempting some amicable way of accommodation; and shall omit nothing that may any way contribute to the amicable terminating this Affair.—Since it is also agreed in the Ar∣ticle
title of Peace afore cited, that till this difference be termi∣nated, the Elector Palatine shall Annually pay to Madam the Dutchess of Orleans, the Sum of 200000 French Livres, or an 100000 Florins of the Rhine, they have also agreed in parti∣cular as to the payment of the said Sum, upon the time when it shall commence; that it shall commence only, after that (according to the Contents of the said Article) the States and Places therein specified shall be intirely restored to the Ele∣ctor. And to the end that Madam the Dutchess of Orleans may be the more assured of the payment of the said Sum; the Elector shall nominate before the Ratification of the Peace, a sufficient number of Renters, or Receivers of the Prefectship of Germersheim, and other places of the Palati∣nate, that shall undertake to pay the said Sum to the said Lady Dutchess, or to those impower'd by her; and that eve∣ry Year at Landaw, to wit, the moiety every six Months; who if they do not keep time shall be lyable to be constrained to the payment, by the ordinary course of Justice, or if need require by Military execution from the Most Christian King. Upon the whole, this payment shall be made upon this con∣dition, viz. That what shall have been paid by vertue of this Annual Obligation to Madam the Dutchess of Orleans dur∣ing the Canvassing of the Cause before the Arbitrators, shall be in compensation and put upon the accompt of that which the said Arbitrators shall adjudge to her, in case they do adjudge any thing at all; but if so be they adjudge nothing, or less than the said Sum, then there shall be a restitution, and this compensation, allowance or restitution, as also the fund and charges of the Process shall be regulated by the Sentence of the Arbitrators: But if Madam the Dutchess of Orleans do not give satisfaction to the form of the Compro∣mise, either in the Instruction of the Process, or in the An∣swer that shall be produced by the Elector Palatine, or if she delays it, the course of the said yearly payment shall be interrupted only during that same time, the Process going on still, according to the form of the Compromise. Done at the Palace of Ryswick the 30th of October, 1697. 'Tis not my Business to answer the foolish Objections some ill-willed Persons have made against the stability of this Peace. However I shall observe, That tho this Peace with the Empire was not so advantageous to it, and the Restitu∣tion of Lorrain not in so ample a manner as could have been wished for; yet if it be considered that France has given up very considerably on this side, and some places she had long been possessed off, particularly Brisac, which hath apper∣tained to that Crown for very near 60 Years; That by the Taking of Casal, and the Peace with Savoy, she is entirely
precluded out of Italy; that the same Barrier is left in Ca∣talonia as before; And that there is a stronger Frontier in the Low Countries, by her Restitution of all she took since the beginning of the War, with the Addition of Dinant and Lux∣emburg; If these be put together, it's not likely, that Crown will begin another War in hast, whatsoever our Male-con∣tents at home, or any Enemies we have abroad may atter themselves with, especially considering the inward weakness of that Kingdom, and the strong Union there is between the Crown of England and the Republick of Holland, whose Na∣val Powers are so Formidable, and Interests so great in all the Parts of the World. Over and above all this, we are to note, His Most Christian Majesty is now in an advanced Age, which is usually attended with an ill Habit of Body; and too wise a Prince, easily to be brought to engage himself in the Toils and Uncertainties of another War; especially, in that there was so little gained, or I should have rather said, so much lost by this: To say nothing of that Regard he will un∣doubtedly have to the Interests of his Posterity, as well as his Dominions; whose Affairs, at his Death, he will be very unwilling to leave embroiled with those of their Neighbours. It remains therefore now, that I take notice that his Ma∣jesty King William staid in Holland till all was over, and af∣ter having very Honourably paid off all the Forreign Troops, who by this time were Marching to their respective Homes after the Toyls of this long War, He returned to England, and upon the 16th of November, at the Citizens request, made His Publick Entry thro' London, being attended by all the Men of Quality in very great State, and never, (I am sure,) in one Day saw so many People (and all of them His own Subjects) in all His Life-time; and in whose Affections He Triumphed as much as ever he had done at any time over His Enemies; and may He always do the first, and ne∣ver have occasion for the second, but may we long live under the Benign Influence of His Reign, who hath Rescued our Religion and Liberties out of the Jaws of Hell and Destructi∣on, so intrepidly ought our Battles for us, and now at length restored unto us the Comforts and Blessing of a Firm and Honourable Peace. Having now run thro' all the Transactions both of War and Peace that fell out within the revolution of this Year, we shall draw towards a closure of it, with the meeting of the English Parliament December the 3d: And see how his Majesty was pleased to deliver himself to them upon this Conjuncture, and this he did in these Terms.
My Lords and Gentlemen, THE War, which I Entred into by the Advice of my People, is by the Blessing of God, and their Zealous and Affectionate Assistance, brought to the End We all proposed, an Honourable Peace; which I was willing to Conclude, not so much to Ease My Self from any Trouble or Hazard, as to free the Kingdom from the Continuing Burden of an Expensive War. I am heartily sorry My Subjects will not at first find all th Relief from the Peace, which I could wish, and they may expect; but the Funds intended for the last Year's Service have fallen short of Answering the Sums for which they were given, so that there remain considerable Deficiencies to be Provided for. There's a Debt upon the Account of the Fleet and the Army. The Revenues of the Crown have been anticipated by My Con∣sent, for Publick Vses; so that I am wholly destitute of means support the Civil List; and I can never distrust you'll suffer th to turn to My Disadvantage, but will provide for Me during my Life, in such a manner, as may be for my Honour, and for the Honour of the Government. Our Naval Force being increased to near double what it was at My Accession to the Crown, the Charge of maintaining it wil be proportionably augmented, and it is certainly necessary for the Interest and Reputation of England, to have always a great Strength at Sea. The Circumstances of Affairs Abroad are such, that I think My Self obliged to tell you My Opinion, that for the present, England cannot be safe without a Land Force; and I hope We shall not give those who mean us ill, the Opportunity of Effecting that, under the Notion of a Peace, which they could not bring to pass by a War. I doubt not but you, Gentlemen of the House of Commons, wil take these Particulars into your Consideration, in such a manner to provide the necessary Supplies, which I do very earnestly Reco∣mend to you. My Lords and Gentlemen, That which I most delight to think of, and am best pleased own is, That I have all the Proofs of My People's Affection th Prince can desire; and I take this Occasion to give them the Solemn Assurance, That as I never had, so I never will nor have any Interest separate from theirs. I Esteem it one of the greatest Advantages of the Peace, that I shall now have leisure to rectifie such Corruptions or Abuses as may have crept into any part of the Administration during the W and effectually to discourage Prophaness and Immorality; and I shall employ My Thoughts in Promoting Trade, and Advancing Happiness and Flourishing Estate of the Kingdom.
I shall conclude with telling you, That as I have with the Haz∣ard of every thing, Rescued your Religion, Laws and Liberties, when they were in the Extreamest Danger, so I shall place the Glory of My Reign in preserving them Entire, and Leaving them so to Posterity. The Hearty Addresses of Both Houses to his Majesty here∣upon,The Parlia∣ment Ad∣dess the King. could not be more acceptable to him, than it was then strange to the generality of People, to read it in our Gazette that his Majesty had received Letters from the French King and the Dauphine, acquainting him with the Duke of Bur∣gundy's Marriage, and that the Duke of St. Albans was there∣upon ordered for France to return the Complement; seeing there had been no Communication between England and France now for so many Years, and such a rooted Enmity between both Nations, to say nothing of those at the Head of them, that the so sudden disappearances of it made it to vulgar Minds in some sort unconceivable: And as the Year thus happily began to close in England, it did the same also in Ireland, where after that Parliament had past divers good Bills, and among others, one for granting an Additional Du∣ty upon Tobacco, besides a supply granted to his Majesty by way of a Poll, they were Prorogued to the 10th of May en∣suing; And for Scotland, all things went there also Easy and Peaceable: So that we have nothing more to observe, save two Things, the Death of Queen Eleanor, Dec. 17th in the 45th Year of her Age; She was Married to Michael Wisno∣wiski King of Poland, and afterwards to the late Duke of Lor∣rain: She was Daughter to the Emperor Ferdinand III. and Sister to the Emperor now Reigning; it was the Conjecture of some that the Grief She conceived to find her Son the young Duke was not to be restored to the Inheritance of his Ancestors in as ample a manner as She expected, might hasten her End; but however it were, She died lamented by all for her rare Qualities and Endowments. 2d. The Czar of Muscovy, Peter Alexowitz, his beginning his Travels into Forreign Courts this Year, for the Improve∣ment of himself and too barbarous Subjects in Arts and Sci∣ences; a rare Example in a Prince, but whether a Pattern for other Princes to follow, I cannot determine; but of this Prince we shall have occasion to say some more before we close up this Treatise. It was some mortification to us the beginning of this Year, to have one of the King's Pallaces consumed, for on the 4th of January White-Hall,Whitehall burt. by what accident is vaiously re∣ported, took Fire in one of the Lodgings in the Body of the Structure, and in a short time got to such an Head, that it
could not be mastered, till the whole Body of the Pallace, with several other adjoyning Lodgings, was laid in Ashes: However, this was but a Flea-bite to what the Nation had gone thro' in the course of the War;Parliament proceedings. and so our Parliament went tightly to work upon the Affairs of the Nation; and finding the business of our Coin pretty well remedied, as al∣so the currency of any hammered Silver Mony would be any longer a grievance, they made an Act to prevent it, and for the Recoining of such as was then in being, as also for making out new Exchequer Bills, where the former Bills were or should be filled up by Endorsements. It was moreover far∣ther considered by them, that whereas now by the Peace there would be a free intercourse between England and France, it was enacted there should be no Correspondence held with the late King nor his Adherents upon any account; They also took care to discharge and satisfie the Arrears of several Annuities that incurred between the 17th of May, 1696. and May 17th, 1697. But that you may not think they forgot the disbanding of the Army, paying of Seamen, and such things, they gave to his Majesty no less than the Sum of 1484015 l. 1 s. 11 d. 3/1 f. to which we may add the granting of several Duties upon Coal and Culm; The Con∣tinuation of Duties upon Coffee, &c. to pay off the Tran∣sport Debt for the Reduction of Ireland; Besides a great many other useful Bills: They further, settled the East-In∣dia Trade, and thereby raised two Millions of Money at 8 per Cent. and that in less time than any Nation in Europe could pretend to at that time of day; And that all due re∣gard might be had to his Majesty's Honour and Support, they granted a Subsidy upon Tunnage and Poundage, for the raising of Seven Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year, for the Service of his Houshold. Abundance of other Bu∣siness was indeed done by this Sessions, which terminated up∣on the 5th of July;King's Speech. When his Majesty was pleased to tell them, he could not take his leave of so good a Parliament, without publickly acknowledging the Sence he had of the great things they had done for him and his People; reca∣pitulated to them what every Session had done, by the As∣sociation, Remedying the Coin, restoring such Supplies for the War as produced an honourable Peace, Provision for satisfying the publick Debts, with as little burden as could be; All which would give a lasting Reputation to that Parliament, and be the Subject of Emulation to them that should come after: He thanked the Commons also for the E∣stablishment of his Revenue, profess'd the Esteem and Love he had for his People, for whose Sakes he had avoided no Hazzards in War, and should make it his Study and Care to continue unto them the Advantages of Peace. This be∣ing
done, the Houses were for the present prorogued, and July 7th dissolved by Proclamation, another Parliament be∣ing at the same time called to meet at Westminster,Parl. dissol∣ved, another called. August the 24th, but by several Prorogations they did not sit till November. But while these things were transacted, mutual Embassies passed between England and France, in which last Country no Embassador perhaps ever carry'd it with greater Prudence, Honour, and Magnificence, than my Lord Portland did, or was ever so much carress'd and respected; And the French themselves, instead of pretend∣ing that Count Tallard ever came up with him, have endea∣voured occasionally to put it off with siftless Excuses. The Business of Parliament was but a few days over, when his Majesty was pleased to declare in Council his Intention of going for a short time into Holland,K goes for Holland. and constituted the Abp. of Canterbury, the L. Chancellor, the L. Privy Seal, the L. Steward of his Houshold, the Earls of Dorset, Marlborough, Romney and Orford, with Mr. Montague, first Commissioner of the Treasury, to be Lords Justices of England, for the Administration of the Government during his Majesty's Ab∣sence. On the 21st of July his Majesty landed safe in Hol∣land, from whence we leave him to go to, and return from the Court of Zell, and will not pretend to unravel the My∣stery of that Journey (being content to esteem it as a per∣formance of a Promise the King had made to visit the old Duke, who he was wont to call Father, tho' by the Orders given the French Embassador here to attend him, it should seem they should suspect some-what more than that in it) but return to tell you that in the mean time, viz. July the 19th, the Parliament of Scotland met, and during the short time of their sitting, which was but to the beginning of Sep∣tember, made several good Acts, and were then prorogued to the 25th of November following: Neither were the Lords Justices in Ireland wanting in their Duties to his Majesty and the Country, for they took a Progress this Summer in order to view the State of several Places in the Kingdom, and give such Instructions as the saw convenient for the Security of the Government, and good of the Subject. But how Prosperous soever things went with us at home,The Affair of Spain. the Apprehensions of the Death of the King of Spain, who was sick more or less for a great part of this Year, made all Europe uneasie for fear of another War; It will be im∣pertinent for me to enter upon the particulars of the King's Sickness and Distemper, that being fitter for a Physitian's Diary, than an History; However, it is my part to ob∣serve that a Fleet of French Men of War and Gallies com∣ing into Caiz-Bay, and afterwards their giving out they would Winter there (to say nothing of those Gallies that
went to Naples) gave no small Umbrage to their Neigh∣bours; And tho' I will not say the Arrival of the English and Dutch Squadron in Cales-Bay, some time after, made them think fit to return to their own Ports, yet it is certain that that, with the King's Recovery, made their Affairs in that Country look quite with another Aspect than they had done a little before, when nothing was less expected than that the Duke of Berry should succeed, the Marquess of Harco, the French Embassador, valuing himself much upon the Pa∣ces he thought he had made to that end. But while all this was in Agitation towards Spain, the French were busie in the North to perfect an Allyance with the Crown of Sweden, which at length was brought to bear, and the same was notified by M. de Lissenheim, his Swedish Majesty's Minister, to the Envoys of other Courts, residing at Ham∣borough and other Places; The main Intention of what was made publick of this Allyance, is to preserve the Repose of Europe, and the Articles were to this purpose; I. THat the Ancient Alliance is renew'd between the two Kings,Articles of Alliance be∣tween France and Sweden. their Heirs and Successors. II. That the Aim and Intention of this Treaty is to pre∣serve and secure the Common Peace by such means as shall be adjudg'd most proper and convenient. III. If it should come to pass that it should be disturb'd by any Breaches and Hostilities, that the two Kings will make it their Business to repair the wrongs in an amicable way. IV. And if their Cares prove ineffectual, they will joyntly consider of ways to defend the Rights of the Country in∣jur'd. V. In case any Prince or State will enter into this Treaty within a Year, they shall be admitted by the consent of both Kings. VI. Neither the one nor the other shall make Peace or Truce without comprehending the other therein. VII. The Articles of the Treaties formerly concluded by either of the two with other Kings, Princes, or States, shall remain in their full Strength and Vertue, so far as they shall not be contrary to this. VIII. The Freedom of Commerce between the Subjects of the two Kings, shall be preserv'd as formerly, without any Impeachment, as well in time of War as in Peace, paying the usual Duties. IX. In pursuance of which, all Ports, Cities and Provinces shall be open to the Subjects of both Crowns, according as the Laws and Customs shall permit, both to sell their Commo∣dities in those Places, and buy others.
X. This particular Treaty shall continue Ten Years, with Liberty to prolong this Term, if it be judg'd convenient by the two Kings, who by consent shall have a watchful Eye up∣on the means to preserve the Peace against the Dangers that threaten it. XI. This Treaty shall be exchang'd by both sides within three Months after the Signing, or sooner if it may be. Given at Stockholm the 9th of July, O. S. 1698. I shall not meddle here with the Mock-Battle at Compeign, nor the more violent persecution of the Reformed since the Peace, both of them being Subjects ungrateful to my Pal∣late; but pass on into Germany, where to say nothing yet of the Discourse concerning the Marriage of the King of the Ro∣mans, with the Princess of Hanover, we find a mighty dis∣position in the Emperor and his Confederates also, to a Peace with the Turks,Overtres of Peace with the Turks. after the continuance of a War for above fifteen Years, wherein perhaps there has been as much va∣riety of Action as in any other whatsoever, but now it seems to draw to a period, and things look in the World as if Janus his Temple was once more to be shut up: And tho the Ar∣mies in Hugary on both sides, were considerable in number and Strength, yet there seemed no great disposition in either for Action, but much more in the Parties concerned to set up a Treaty of Peace under the Mediation of his Britannick Majesty and the States General, by their Ministers the Lord Paget and M. Colliers, who towards the middle of August ar∣rived in the Turkish Camp near Belgrade, and by their good Offices got the Place to hold the Conferences to be between Peter Waradin and Salankemen; the Emperor and Confede∣rate Ministers being to reside at Crlowitz, the Sultan's at Salankamen, and the Mediators between the two Places. The Emperor's Plenipotentiaries, were the Count of Ottengen, General Slick, and the Count de Marsigli; those of the Port, were the Effendi, or Chancellor of the Ottoman Empire, and Mauro Cordato; for Venice, came Signior Ruzzini, Em∣bassador in Ordinary from the Republick, to the Court of Vienna, and Seignior Wicolasi, Secretary of the said Repub∣lick; for Poland, appear'd the Sieur Malokowski, Palatine of Posnania; and for the Moscovites, Procopius Pogdanowitz Vos∣nicin. I shall now leave the Plenipotentiaries to meet and not en∣ter upon the Particulars of the Negotiation, my design be∣ing to reserve that for the closing up of this Work, nor shall I take any Notice of the Conspiracy which was said to have been formed by the Army under General Rabain, in Transilvania, to kill him and the rest of the Officers, and
then to go over to the Turks, because I believe there was more Noise than Truth in it: But I shall return where I left off last Year,The troub∣led Affairs of Poland. with the Polish Affairs, and observe, that tho' the King's Competitor was now gone without any like∣lihood of ever returning again, and that the potent City of Danzick were firm to his Interest, yet other Difficulties, from the Obstinacy of the Cardinal Primate and his Adhe∣rents, and from the present Necessity he lay under to be guarded in Poland with his own Troops, made his Affairs much perplex'd; However, he set forward and arrived at Warsaw, January the 14th, in great State. The King us'd all imaginable Endeavours to bring the Primate to submit, and the Offices of the Brandenburg Minister were indefatiga∣ble to this end, but the stubborn old Gentleman shew'd altogether as much Aversion on the other hand, and order∣ed the Senators, Lords, and Gentlemen that were confede∣derated in the Rocosche, to meet the 18th of February. To encounter which, in some measure, the King thought of no better way than to issue out his Circular Letters, to sum∣mon the Dyet of Pacification to Assemble on the 16th of April; But this being thought not sufficient, as soon as the Rocosche was met at Lowitz, the King sent the Grand Mares∣chal of the Crown, and the Great Treasurer of Lithuania as his Deputies thither, with a Letter also from his Majesty to the Assemby. But the Title of Commissioners, and some Expressions in the Letter, which were thought too smart, offended the Rocosche to that degree, that they not only re∣fused to admit the Deputies, but they were also forced to re∣tire to the Castle of Lowitz, after a narrow Escape from some Danger: Nay, the Common People grew so insolent that they fired upon the Windows of the Brandenburg En∣voy's Lodgings, notwithstanding his publick Character, and the Prohibitions of the Cardinal Primate to the contrary. The Deputies hereupon sent presently Advice of what had passed, to the King, who sent them another Letter, with new Powers; However, after some Contestation, they re∣ceived the Letter, and then drew up the following Arti∣cles: 1. POsitive Assurances were demanded from Rome of the Change of the King's Religion.The Propo∣sals of the Rocosche. 2. That the Queen should embrace the same Religion. 3. That it should be also settl'd in Saxony. 4. That the Provinces dismember'd from the Crown, should be re-united. 5. That an account should be given of the Money that had been expended. 6. That the Pacta Conventa should be drawn up by themselves, and presented by the Marshall of the Rocosche. 7. That the va∣cant Employments which had been dispos'd of, should be
confirm'd by new Pattents. 8. That all the Foreign Forces should be sent away. 9. That in consideration of the Damages done by the Saxon Soldiers, the Elector should grant Win∣ter-Quarters to the Polanders, in the Countries under his Dominion. 10. That no Employments should be given to Foreigners. 11. That the Indigenat granted to the House of Saxony should not extend beyond the Electoral Branch. 12. That being acknowledg'd for King, he should not as∣sume the Title of Elector. 13. That the Damages done by the Army should be repair'd at the Expences of the Grand General. 14. That all the Officers of the Army, and of the King's Guards should be Roman Catholicks. 15. That all unprofitable Foreigners, should be sent away. 16. That the City of Danzick should have Reparation for the Damages sustain'd by the War, upon the Account of his Electoral Highness. 17. That a Decree should be publish'd against the Bishop of Cujavia, by which he should be forbid to Crown any King. 18. That Enquiry should be made into the Violence that was made use of in forcing the Trea∣sury, that the like Attempt may be prevented for the future. 19. That the Ecclesiasticks shall not be molested in the En∣joyment of their Estates. 20. That General Brandt shall be prosecuted in the Courts of Justice, for the Damages done by his Men; for which Satisfaction shall be given. 21. That all Acts made during this Fraction or Division of the Re∣publick, shall be cancell'd and made void. Some there were for all this, who submitted to the King, who notwithstanding the ill Success of the said Assembly, and their exorbitant Demands, resolved upon his Journey into Prussia; And on the 17th of March, arrived near Danzick, into which place he made his Publick Entry with great Mag∣nificence, was treated most splendidly, and on the 25th, re∣ceived the Homage of the City, after he had confirm'd their Privileges, and taken an Oath to maintain them according to the usual Form; But his Majesty all this while did not forget to notifie his Advancement to the Polish Throne in all the Courts of Europe, and Major General Jordan was more particularly sent into France upon that occasion.The Nucio his Media∣tion. In the mean time Seignior Paulucci, the Pope's Extraordinary Nuncio, arrived at Warsaw; And because the King was then absent at Danzick, he sent to Lowitz to give the Primate notice of his Arrival, and presently after went to Visit his Eminency, at the same time consigning the Pope's Brief in∣to his Hands, whereby he was exhorted to employ his ut∣most Care to settle the Tranquility of Poland, and to pre∣serve and procure the farther Advantage of the Roman Ca∣tholick Religion; Assuring him, That he had ordered his
Nuncio to omit nothing upon all Occasions, that might tend to the Preservation of the Rights and Priviledges of his E∣minency: To which the Cardinal answered, That he would always submit to his Holiness in Spirituals; That if his Holiness, after he had seriously examined the State of things, were of Opinion the Roman Catholick Religion was safe, he was willing to believe so too: But as to what concerned the Temporal Interests of the Republick, he could not quit them without Injury to his own Character and Dignity, without drawing upon himself the Reproach of the Nation, and without being brought under a Necessity of becoming an∣swerable for it in his own Person; However, that he accepted the Mediation of the Holy Father with a filial Obedience. This was a pretty good Pace, for tho' the Dyet of Paci∣fication, upon the King's return, meeting upon the time appointed, made but a very small Appearance, and that some of them flung out of the Assembly, with a Protesta∣tion, and persisting in their Demands, of a Dyet to be held on Horse-back; Yet the Cardinal Primate, who was to have held the Assembly of the Rocosche, April 15th, put the same off till the 5th of May: And when they then met, there was but a very small Appearance, and all the Opposition they pretended to make signified nothing: For the good Of∣fices of the Nuncio at length, so far prevailed, that on the 16th of May the Treaty of Accommodation was fairly writ,Brings the Primate to submit. publickly read with all its Explanations, and then signed by the Commissioners, as the King's Plenipotentiaries, by the Cardinal Primate, Marshal of the Rocosche, Deputies of the Palatinates that were present, and by Seignior Paulucci, as Mediator and Guarrantee of the Treaty. The Articles consisted of twelve Particulars to this purpose. 1. THat the King shall use his utmost Endeavour to bring over the Queen to the Catholick Religi∣on; and that he shall prove by visible, uncontroulable, and authentick Testimonies, and such, in a word, which the Primate and the Pope's Nuncio shall deem proper, that he has effectually embrac'd the Catholick Religion. 2. That he shall dismiss all the Lutheran Ministers that are in his Army. 3. That he shall give an Authentick Act to the Repub∣lick, by which he shall consent, that the Liberty of Suffra∣ges and Elections shall be restor'd; and promise never to re-demand the vast Sums which the Crown has cost him. 4. That he shall pay all the Arrears which are due to the Army of the Crown.
5. That he shall employ his own Soldiers in the Siege of Caminiec, and for the Recovery of Podolia, which shall af∣terwards be re-united and incorporated in the Crown. 6. That then he shall send back his Soldiers into Saxony, and repair the Damages done by his Saxon Soldiers. 7. That he shall revoke the Concessions of Crown-Lands, and take 'em away from those on whom he has bestow'd 'em, and that the Revenues thereof shall be employ'd toward the Subsistance of his Houshold. 8. That he shall revoke and disannul all the Protestations which he made against the Primate, and the Heads of the Rocosche. 9. That he shall confer no Employments, Benefices, &c. but upon Polanders, who shall profess the Roman Catholick Religion; and that the Members of the Rocosche shall be preferr'd before others, in the Distribution of publick Em∣ployments. 10. That the River Pisca shall be made Navigable at the King's Expences. 11. That after the Expedition to Caminiec is ended, a General Dyet of Pacification shall be call'd; and that in the mean time his Majesty shall, by his Circulatory Letters, give notice of the Treaty of Agreement to all the Palati∣nates of the Kingdom. 12. That the Tribunals shall remain suspended, till the King be again confirm'd in the Possession of the Crown. This being over, the Cardinal went in great State to wait upon the King, who received him in the Marble Chamber, and according to Custom advanced some few Paces to receive him, and to whom his Eminency made the following Speech in French. SIR, IF I have the Misfortune to present my self among the last,The Pri∣mare's Speech to the King. to pay my most humble Respects to Your Maje∣sty, I have the Satisfaction to bring You the Fruits of a long Expectation, the Hearts of Your Subjects, and the Repose of Your Kingdom. It was not for a Person of my Character to appear without these two Guides, which in regard they are to be the chief Ornaments of Your Reign, I place 'em at the Feet of Your Throne, wishing that whatever eterniz'd the Renown of the Great Augu∣stus, may be accomplish'd in Your Majesty's Sacred Per∣son; to whom I have consecrated my Devotion, and my solid and inviolable Adherence.
But tho' this Agreement we find thus to be at length happily accomplish'd in Poland, yet things in Lithuania con∣tinu'd all this while in utmost confusion;The Trou∣bles of Li∣tuania. the Party of the Great General Sapieha and that of Oginski's, the Great Stan∣dard Bearer, with whom sided the major part of the Nobi∣lity, seeming to remain Irreconcilable; and the demands of the latter were so exorbitant, as if they seemed to be made on purpose to prevent an Accommodation; However, dire Necessity having no Law, and the King being eager to go into the Field, he signed the Articles proposed by them, wherein, among other Things, the inseparable Union and Coaequation of the Rights and Priviledges of the Grand-Dutchy of Lithuania with the Crown of Poland, were agreed on, and both sides bound by Oath to the observance of this Coaequation; That the Imployments of the Great General Mareschal and Treasurer, should still remain, but with no other Priviledges than those allowed to the same Officers of Poland; that the Army should not exceed 9000 Men; That as for the Treasurers paying the Army no longer, unless it were in the Presence of the Palatines, that Point should be referred to the Approbation of the General Diet; That In∣juries and Damages sustained on either side should be for∣gotten, and any new Differences that might arise, should be left to the Arbitration of the next Diet: But so unhappily it fell out, that while they were labouring to bring this Accom∣modation to bear,A Fight in Lithuania. a Bloody Fight happened between Oginski's Forces and those of the Great General, commanded by his Son, wherein the former was defeated, lost four Field-pieces and his Baggage, had part of his Men Killed, part Drowned in the Mimnell, while the rest fled one and another way, the Great Ensign himself making an hard shift to Escape into Ducall Prussia. But neither this nor the daily Brangles and Skirmishes that happened between the Poles and Saxons, could hinder his Majesty to prepare for the Field, in order to which, he arrived Aug. 15th at Leopold, from whence the Czar and Princes of Muscovy,The Czar's Travel's who were got thither before, went to meet him, as far as Rava, where they staid together for some Days; and after all the Demonstrations of a Reciprocal Satisfaction, accompanied with rich Presents on both sides they parted. The Czar began his Travels last Year, first into Brandenburg and thence into Holland to see his Brittanick Majesty, for whose heroick Vertues he had always profest a very high Esteem: From Holland he went for England, and having staid here most part of the Winter, went over for the Court of Vienna, from whence he designed to go for Italy, where there were great Preparations made (and particularly at Venice) for his Reception; but the unhappy News of a Conspiracy having been formed against him in his own Country, made
him post thither, where he quickly brought things into good Order, and his Armies this Year had some Brushes with the Crim Tartars to the disadvantage of the latter: Whatever the matter was, 'twas observed he had a perfect aversion to the French, and notwithstanding (as was said) a very kind In∣vitation from that Monarch, nothing would induce him to go thither, which perhaps was no small Mortification to that Court: The Czar was observed to be wonderfully inquisi∣tive, especially in Maritime Affairs, and very Ingenious, and nothing but the Ignorance of the Customs, and Barbarous∣ness of his Country, could make any think him otherwise. But to leave him, and return to his Polish Majesty, at Leopold he held divers Councils of War, about the Opera∣tions of the Campaign, concerning which the Generals were of very divided Opinions; the formal Siege of Caminiec was the thing which the King aimed at: But while neither that, the Bombarding of it, nor any thing else could be fully re∣solved on,A Fight be∣tween the Poles and Tartars. the Tartars gave him a sharp Check; for the Po∣lish Army being upon their march to joyn that of the Crown upon the Road of Caminiec, Commanded by the Duke of Wirtemburg, the Tartars being informed of the smallness of their Number in comparison of theirs, on the 8th of Sept. met them, under the Command of Sultan Suos Gerey near Podaiza, which upon the 9th obliged the Poles to put them∣selves in order of Battle by break of Day: About Noon the Tartars attack'd their Vanguard, then fell upon the Right and Left Wings of the Poles, both sides Fighting obstinately for a time, at length the Poles gave Ground, and thereby gave the Enemy an Opportunity to penetrate as far as the Gene∣rals Tent; but there they were so vigorously received, that the Polanders had time to rally, and repel the Enemy who were forced to retreat: The Fight lasted 8 Hours, and was Bloody on both sides; The Tartars at first defeated two Com∣panies of Wallachians, under Prince Lubormirski, and at the first Assault took several Waggons full of Baggage. It was allowed the Poles had 900 common Soldiers and 60 Officers Slain, and of the latter there were four Starosts, besides a great many made Prisoners of War, of which two were Sta∣rosts, not to mention the Wounded, whereof the Grand Ge∣neral Jablonowski's Son was one. This, together with the in∣crease of the Troubles in Lithuania, the Complaints of the Polish Army against he Germans, and that they might not Quarter any of them in the Starosties or any other Places where the Polish Troops were to Winter, besides that the Nobi∣lity of Great Poland pretended to Summon a Diet of that Province, without the King's knowledge, must needs have sunk another Prince of less Courage and Abilities than him∣self. But his Majesty having disposed of all things as well as
might be for Winter-quarters, resolved to go for Grodno, in order to appease the Troubles of Lithuania, and at the same time ordered some of his German Regiments, under Major General Fleming, to move that way; but before this could be accomplish'd,Elbing inve∣sted by the  of . as an accumulation of Disorders, in rushes the unwelcome News of the City of Elbing's having been Invested by the Elector of Brandenburg's Troops, under Ge∣ral Brandt, of which he was resolved to make himself Master, as being Mortgaged to him for a great Sum of Mony, unless the said Sum were forthwith repaid him: If the Poles were very much allarm'd at this Enterprize, you may be sure, Elbing was nothing less so; but finding Friends remote, and themselves unable to make any resistance to purpose, they could for the present think of no better Expedient, than to write in very submissive Terms to the Elector, to beg a longer de∣lay; Promising, That in case of the failure of the King of Poland, to whom they desired time to send, they would en∣deavour to satisfy the Electors Demands themselves; to which Letter the Elector was pleased to return an Answer, where∣by because a better view might be had of his Pretentions, take it as follows, Frederick III. by the Grace of God, &c. YOur Letter of the 14th of this Month,The Electors Letter to Elbing. sent us by your Secretary, was faithfully deliver'd to us. We have clearly seen the Request which you make us of the Respite, and the Offer you make us of discharging the Debt your selves, according to your Power, and the Ratie we have granted you. But you and all the World are not Ignorant of a perpetual Treaty concluded at Velau and Bridgost, between the Crown of Poland and our selves, importing, That the City of Elbig should be deliver'd to us for Security of the Payment of a certain Sum. The Elector, our Father and We, have now waited above 40 Years in vain, the Accomplishment of this Treaty so So∣lemnly concluded and ratify'd, so that at length our Pa∣tience was tyr'd. And therefore to prevent the Derision and Blame of Posterity, should we any longer neglect our Rights, and the Interests of our States, we thought our selves oblig'd to make use of the Means which God and the Laws have put into our Hands; All which we have made known to the King and the Senators of Poland. We could have wish'd we could have taken Possession of our Mortgage without Noise and Hostility; But since it could not be, it now solely depends upon you to preserve your City, by doing what we demand with so much Justice.
We protest before God and the World, we have no Ani∣mosity or ill Intention against you or your City, but wish your Preservation and Welfare, provided you answer our Goodness with a becoming and voluntary Accommodation, in which Case we promise upon our Electoral Word, that that you shall be maintain'd in all your Privileges, Pre∣rogatives, and Immunities, as well Spiritual as Temporal, and to re-establish you when we shall have received Satis∣faction. As for your Offer to pay us your Selves, we do not re∣fuse it; But in regard you do not think your Selves able to do it of your Selves, we look upon that Offer as a means only to gain time. Therefore if you neglect this candid Declaration of ours, and suffer things to go to Extremity, we protest before God and Men, that we are Innocent of the Misfortune and Ruin that may befal your City, &c. The Elector moreover writ to the K. of Poland and the Car∣dinal Primate upon this Head, and publish'd also a large Ma∣nifesto in his own Justification, by all which it plainly appear'd to the World he was in earnest, as it did more particularly to the Elbingers, by the Batteries he began to raise, and the Effects whereof they did not much care to feel, where∣fore they agreed to Capitulate, and November the 11th signed these Articles. 1. THat the City shall be maintain'd in the Enjoyment of all its Privileges,The Ar∣ticles of Ebing. Rights, Prerogatives, and Im∣munities, without exacting any new Homage, or Oath to his Electoral Highness, unless it be an Acknowledgment of his Right of Mortgage. 2. That the Exercise of Religion, and Ecclesiastick Rights, shall remain in their Present Condition; as also the Semina∣ries, the Schools, the Hospitals, as well Roman Catholicks as Protestants. 3. That the Magistrates shall be continu'd in their Digni∣ties and Employments, as formerly; and the Election of new ones shall be made as before; they shall also enjoy the same Sallaries and Emoluments. 4. The Elector shall take the Burgesses into his Protection, and maintan 'em in their Privileges. 5. That he shall also preserve their Trade, and endeavour to encrease it, and render it more flourishing. 6. That his Duty upon the Salt-Fish of Pilow shall be suppress, so long as the Mortgage shall last. 7. That his Electoral Highness shall impose no new Du∣ties, either by Sea or Land.
8. That the Traffick of the Town, with the Bishoprick of Ermeland and other Places, within the Territories of Poland, shall remain free and open. 9. That the City shall enjoy all the Goods and Effects which they have within the Electoral Jurisdiction; and the Administration of Justice shall continue as before. 10. His Electoral Highness promises to maintain and pre∣serve the City; to let her have her Cannon, and her Am∣munition; not to deprive the Burghers of their Arms, not to add any new Works to the Fortifications; nor to put any Soldiers into the Old Town. But the Garrison, which shall be but a small Number, in the New Town and the Suburbs, shall be paid by his Electoral Highness, without any Charge to the arghers; nor the Flat Country for quartering of Sol∣diers. 11. His Electoral Highness shall protect and defend the City, and the Inhabitants, in case they be molested by rea∣son of this Capitulation, and the Surrender of their City. 12. That so soon as his Electoral Highness shall be fully satisfy'd of his Pretensions which he claims from the Crown of Poland, the Place shall be restor'd, according to the Tenor of the Treaties. 13. The City shall pay no farther Contributions, than such as shall be impos'd in Dyets, by the States of Royal Prussia. 14. The Keys of the City shall remain in the Custody of the President Burgomaster, who shall also give the Word. 15. The Old City shall be guarded by the City Soldiers, except the Burgesses Gate, and the Middle Post. 16. If any of the Inhabitants will remove to any other Place, they shall be permitted to depart, with their Families and Effects. 17. All Hostilities committed on either side, shall be abo∣lish'd by an Amnesty; and the Soldiers, that shall be oblig'd to quit some Posts, shall do it with Drums beating, lighted Matches, and other Marks of Military Honour, granted up∣on the like Occasions. 18. General Brandt promises to obtain a just Ratification of the Articles above-mention'd. These the Elector ratified with some Variation, where∣in, in respect to the first Head, he consented that the Oath which the City had taken to the King of Poland, should re∣main inviolable, he contenting himself for the present with the Assurances which the Magistrates gave him of their i∣delity; But in case of a Rupture between him and the King, and that their City was to be attack'd, the said Ar∣ticle was to be void, and they were to take the same Oath of Fidelity to him; The Elector was also willing to con∣tribute
all that he had promised on his part for the Preser∣vation and Defence of the City, in case it were attack'd, and to satisfie the Inhabitants for any Losses they might su∣stain, by any new Fortifications he might be obliged to raise for the Defence of the Place; he is farther content, that the President of the Burgomasters should have the Custody of the City-Keys and give the Word, and that the Guard of the old Town, &c. should be entrusted with the Soldiers, in their Pay, except the Burgesses Port, and another Post granted to the Brandenburgers, so long as the City should not be attack'd. But if otherwise, he would have his own Sol∣diers employ'd in all the Posts, where there should be oc∣casion, for the Security and Defence of the City. The Poles have blustred mightily about this Matter, and the King at least wise, in outward appearance, shewed a mighty concern at it; So that with many of them, nothing but a War up∣on the Elector must serve: However, 'tis hoped things are somewhat cooled, and that the Interposition of the Em∣peror, King of Denmark, and the States General, may bring all things again to an amicable Composure, either to bring the Poles to pay the Elector his Money, or confirm Elbing to him. I confess, as it fell out, I do not think Elbing un∣happy in the Change of Masters, the Elector being a Pro∣testant Prince, who is under no Obligation to disturb her in the Exercise of her Religion, and withal so famous for his Prudence, Moderation, and other admirable Qualities, that he cannot but promote the Interests of it; However, I cannot, without some sort of Indignation, think of that Liberty some Princes have assumed to themselves, of Mort∣gaging or out-right Selling of Cities and their Subjects (as Men do Horses and Cows) and not only so, but many times also their Religion, Lives and Properties; Tho' by what di∣vine or humane Right, is beyond my Capacity to under∣stand: But to leave this ungrateful Subject, and return to Lithuania. We told you before of Oginski's Defeat and Flight, which by the Consequence thereof did not appear to be so entire as was at first represented; For he quickly recovered again, and most part of the Nobility joyning in with him, he in his turn, before the end of November, with a body of 15000 Men, fights and defeats the General Sapieha's Army, con∣sisting of about 8000,Sapieha de∣feated. and slew to the number of 2000 of them; But tho this Loss began to open the Eyes of several of the chief Leaders of them, and that being inferiour in Number, they plainly saw the Dangers they expos'd them∣selves too, if they persisted longer to trouble the Repose of the Dutchy, and that thereupon they began to lend an Ear to the Remonstrances and good Offices of the Bishop of
Wilna, for the Re-union of the contending Parties; Yet such was the Obstinacy of Prince Sapieha, that he got what Troop he could together, and posted himself at some distance from the City of Grodno, while the other Quartered himself on the other side of the said City, with the Nobility of the Country and his other Adherents, who far surpassed the Prince in Strength, and where they seemed to be ready to engage, when General Fleming suddenly came and posted himself with 28 Saxon Companies between both Armies, with Orders to fire upon those that committed the first act of Hostility. This he had no sooner done, but he sent Orders to Prince Sapieha, in the King and Republick's Name, to disband his Army upon the Place; Which tho' the Prince at first made a scruple to obey, yet considering the pernicious Consequences of a Refusal, and the vast inequa∣lity of Force between them, his Enemy being computed to be thrice his Strength, he resolved to yield Obedience: Up∣on which, Commissioners were appointed on both sides, in the Presence of General Fleming, whom the King had ap∣pointed as Mediator,The Lithua∣nian Trou∣bles appeas∣ed. and a Treaty of Accommodation was signed, December the 20th; Importing, That Sapieha's Ar∣my, which was the chief Cause of the Contest, in so severe a Season, should be forthwith disbanded, 2620 Foot should be kept still in Pay, comprehending the Regiment allow'd by the Republick; That the Officers should Swear an Oath of Fidelity, and engage never to Attempt any thing against the Republick, and faithfully to serve the King; That the Hungarian Troops should be disbanded, 1140 Dragoons should be kept on foot; That the Soldiers, as well disband∣ed as otherwise, should be promised free Quarters in lieu of all their Pretensions; That all Hostilities committed on both sides should be obliterated by a General Amnesty; That the Money which the King had promised the Army by the Pacta Conventa, should be paid, and that the Republick should press the Performance of the said Pacta Conventa. But as for the four Quarters promised by the Republick, De∣puties should be sent to the next Dyet, that the Money might be paid to the Respective Companies; No new Le∣vies should be made without the Dyet, and that till the same met, all possible care should be taken that the General of Lithuania might exactly observe the Institution of the Coae∣quation. And whereas some Palatines had hitherto refused Winter Quarters, and other Contributions, Commissioners should be sent to the Dyet to demand Satisfaction; That the Right of Coaequation, Partition, &c. as also the Tribu∣nal of Lithuania should be preserved inviolable, and that all Manifesto's for that end should remain in full Force, as to that particular; But should be annull'd in every thing that
concern'd the General of Lithuania, his Family, and other Persons in particular, comprehended in the said Manifesto's, and that all possible security should be procured for their Persons, Estates, and Dignities; That the Government of General should subsist upon the Terms of Coaequation, and that his Pension be reserved to him; That for the Sum which he promised to pay some Ensigns out of his own Money, the same should be taken out of what should arise from the four Quarters: The Artillery was to be paid out of the Revenue of Lipiuski, Germoreski, and Winosopski, till the succeeding Dyet, of which the General of the Artillery was to give an account to the succeeding Dyets at hand; That the Artillery should be laid up in the Arsenal of Wilna, from whence it was not to be taken out, but to be employ'd against the Enemies of the Republick; That Protection should be granted to the Lithuanian Tartars, as well for their Estates as Persons, upon Condition that they took forth∣with the Oath of Fidelity to the King and the Repub∣lick. Having thus dispatch'd the Affairs of the North, I shall not amuse the Reader in this place with the Naval Fight that hapned between the Venetian and Ottoman Fleets, in the Waters of Mitylene, on the 20th of September, since I can∣not, with any Certainty, assign what Loss was sustained, or the Victory to either side, so various have the Reports been, tho' the former laid a Claim to it, but design now to resume the Negotiations of the Peace with the Turks, (al∣ready mentioned) but because the same has spun out into the new Year before the final Conclusion of it, I shall here, according to my Custom, briefly touch upon the Remark∣ables of the last. Towards the beginning of February,The death of the Duke of Courland. dyed Frederick Casimir, Duke of Courland, at Mittau, the place of his Residence, who was succeeded by his Son, Frederick Casimir, a Child of of about Six Years Old; During whose Minority, Prince Ferdinand his Uncle, who has embrac'd the Popish Religion, would have taken the Guardianship and Administration up∣on him; But the States have interposed, and the young Prince is to be bred up a Protestant. The third of the same Month was also fatal to Ernestus Augustus,The death of the Duke of Hanover. Elector and Duke of Hanover, and Bishop of Os∣naburg, who departed this Life at Hernhausem. He was born, November the 10th, 1629. being third Son to George Duke of Lunemburg, and Anne Eleonora, Daughter of Land∣grave Lewis of Hesse-Damrstadt. He was married in 1659. to the Princess Palatine Sophia, Daughter to Frederick, Elector Palatine, and Elizabeth Stuart, Daughter of King James I. and Sister to King Charles I. by whom he had several Children,
and whereby it appears the present Elector, his Son, is next in Succession, after the Royal Family here, by the present Constitution of the Government, that no Roman Catholick shall inherit, to the Crown of England: By the Peace of Westphalia, the deceased Elector was designed Bishop of Os∣nabrug, (which is a very considerable Country) when the Alternative was settled, for one time a Roman Catholick, and next time a Prince of the House of Lunemburg, of which he took Possession in 1668. upon the death of the Cardinal of Wirtemburg, the last Roman Catholick Bishop. The Em∣peror was no sooner informed of the Elector's death, but that in pursuance to the said Treaty, he dispatch'd away a Commissioner to be present at the Election of a new Bi∣shop, for which there were divers Candidates, and about which the Capitulars were extreamly divided; But at length, April the 14th, they all united in favour of Charles, Joseph, Ignatius of Lorrain, Bishop of Olmutz, the Duke of that Name's Brother, who was advanced to that Dignity. And now we have mentioned the Death of two Illustri∣ous Persons,The Dukes of Holstein and Lorrain married. we shall take notice of as many marriages: One was in the North, at the Swedish Court, between the Duke of Holstein Gottorp, and Hedwig Sophia, Princess Royal of Sweden, which was Consummated at Carelsbourg on the 12th of June without any Solemnity: But the other, between the present Duke of Lorrain and Elizabeth Charlotte, Daughter to the Duke of Orleans, the French King's Brother, was per∣formed upon the 12th of October at Fontainbleau with so much Pomp and Ceremonious Observances, that I have no great Stomach to relate the Particulars, and as little to call to mind the death Ferdinand Joseph, Electoral Prince of Bavaria, who departed this Life February 16th, N. S. 1699. not long after (as was given out, and that very probably) the King of Spain had settled the Succession of that Crown upon him, and the French King's Memorial at Madrid upon that Subject was a manifest Confirmation of it; And the Truth of it is, if there was a Right of Succession any where, it must be in the Person of this young Prince by vertue of the Seventeenth Article of the Pyrenean Treaty; Which undoubtedly must have stood good in Point of Justice, what∣ever others have said against it, in favour of another Per∣son; else we must account Don Lewis de Haro (one of the wisest Ministers of State that ever Spain bred) a ool, and no Treaties how solemnly soever made, of any Validi∣ty. But now to draw to a Closure,Conference of Peace with the Turks. we are to remind you that the Plenipotentiaries on either side, both Christian and Turk, with the Mediators, met at Crlitz, in order to terminate so long and expensive a War by a Peace, or
at least a Truce for some term of Years. It was the th of November when the Mediators delivered to the Turkish Ple∣nipotentiaries, the Preliminary Articles, which mainly in Substance contained, That each Party respectively should retain what he had got, and the following days, till the 12th, were spent in preparing Matters, upon which they were to enter in Conference that day: On the 13th, the Imperial and Turkish Plenipotentiaries caused several fair Tents to be set up on the sides of the House appointed for the Conferences, and by Nine in the Morning the first ar∣rived at the Mediators Lodgings, whither the Turks also repaired at the same time, and from thence went altoge∣ther to the House of Conference; where after mutual Ci∣vilities, they took their Places in the midst of the Tent, which had four Doors, two whereof being opposite to one another, served for the Entrance of the Mediators, and the other two for the Imperial and Turkish Plenipotentiaries. The Count of Oinghen had the right of the former, and Reis Effendi of the latter▪ The Mediators Secretaries, and those of the Imperial Embassy, were placed behind, and the Turkish Secretary, who stood up-right before, sat down upon the Floor: And this was the manner of the opening of the first Conference, after pronouncing of these Words, God-Grant an happy Pce. There was a Table in the midst between the Mediators and Plenipotentiaries; And the Conference lasted from half an Hour after Ten, till Three in the Afternoon, when the Mediators and Plenipotentiaries went out in the same order as they entred; But all the while they were within, the Emperor's and Turkish Guards, besides a great Number of Officers of both Nations, en∣vironed the Tent. The Conferences were renewed in the same manner the three succeeding days with good Success; And among other things, they conferred about the Regu∣lation of Limits between the two Empires and Republick of Venice too, wherein the Christians appearing somewhat stiff, the Turkish Plenipotentiaries moved, That seeing they had the misfortune, in the Course of that unhappy War, to lose a whole Kingdom, so many rich and fertile Provinces, and such a Number of strong Fortresses, they should not think it much to make them some few Concessions of small Consequence, in re∣ference to the Boundaries of their Empire, to the end that they might be proclaimed and received so much the more acceptably therein, seeing after all they must carry the News of it to Con∣stantinople with Tears in their Eyes. Some Debates arising hereupon, and concerning other things, as the giving up of Teckeley, and the holy Sepulcre, the dismantling of Caminice, and the surrendring of another Place upon the  Sea, besides the quitting of Asoph, to
the Moscovites, but much more concerning the Venetian and Turkish Limits, besides the demolishing of some advantageous Places, as Lepanto, Prevesa, &c. occasioning them to send Ex∣presses to their respective Principals, spun out almost the new Year; But at length the Imperialists, Poles, and Mos∣covites, concluded their part of the Treaty, and perhaps would have done it sooner, but in some sort of Compli∣ance to the Venetians; But that of Moscovy being only a Truce for two Years, and consequently of the least Moment, they had not long agreed it, but they signed it also, and was in the Substance as follows; An Extract of the Treaty between the Czar of Moscovy, and the Sultan of the Turks. I. THere shall be a Truce between the two Empires for two Years, to begin from the Fifteenth of Decem∣ber, 1698. during which time both Parties shall make it their Business to re-settle and confirm Amity and good Un∣derstanding by a perpetual Peace, or at least by a Truce of several Years. II. During that Term, all the Acts of Hostility shall be forborn on both sides. III. Orders shall be given to prevent Incursions, and that no Acts of Hostility may be committed by the Subjects of the two Empires, and particularly the same Orders shall be given to the Tartars of Crimea, and to the other Hords of Tartars, and to the Cosacques, as well Moscovite as Ot∣toman, And such as shall directly or indirectly violate this Treaty, whether Turks or Moscovites, shall be apprehend∣ed, imprison'd, and punish'd without Mercy. To which effect the Cham of Crimea shall be comprehended in this Treaty. Carlowitz, December the 25th, 1698. Procopius Pogdanowitz Vosnicin, Plenipotentiary, and Embassador Extraordinary from his Czarrian Majesty. Mehemid Rami, Grand Chancellor. Alexander Mauro cordati de Scarlati.
The Conferences with the Venetians in the mean time went on;  and in that held on the 4th of January, there were great Contests between the Turks and them, and the Heat grew to that height, that Effendi would have broken off, but that his Colleague moderated his Passion; yet on the 10th, all the Embassadors repaired to the Place of meet∣ing sooner than usual; when the Lord Paget began his Con∣ference with an eloquent Speech, and was seconded therein by the Imperial Embassadors; after whom the first of the Turkish Plenipotentiaries spoke, aggravating, upon the length of time which had been already lost, the inconveniency of the Place, and stiffness of the Venetians for delaying the Conclusion of the Treaty; at length it was concluded in the said Conference, That the Treaty between the two Empires should be signed upon the 26th of the same Month; That the Mediators should give their Words to the same purpose, without prejudice to the Conditions of the Vene∣tians, touching of the Regulation of the Limits of Dalmatia, and that the Turks should not retract their Words to facili∣tate the said Regulations. Two or three days after this, the Polish Plenipotentiaries signed, yet upon Condition their Signing should not take Effect till the Imperial Plenipoten∣tiaries should Sign their Treaty; and that with the Poles was to this effect. An Extract of the Treaty of Peace concluded between the King and Republick of Poland, and the Grand Signior at Carlowitz, Ja∣nuary the 26th, 1699. I. THE ancient Amity and good Correspondence shall be re-established, and the Provinces depending up∣on Poland shall for the future be distinguished from those of the Ottoman Empire, by their ancient Limits, without any Change or Alteration of Extension or Restriction. II. All the Fortresses or Cities comprehended within the ancient Limits of Moldavia before the preceding War, and which were till now in the possession of the Polanders, shall be evacuated and restor'd. III. That the Fortress of Caminiec shall be restor'd to the King and Republick of Poland in the Condition it now is, together with all Podolia and all the Vckrain.
IV. The Grand Signior shall publish his Royal Edicts and express Prohibitions to all his Subjects of what Nation or Condition soever, particularly to the Tartars, enjoining them not to commit any farther Acts of Hostility against Poland. V. Seeing the Republick of Poland has always enjoy'd her Liberty, she shall not be molested by any Demand or Pretension of the Ottoman Empire, under any pretence what∣ever. VI. The Tartars of Budziack having formerly committed several Rapines and Violences in Moldavia, which is contra∣ry to the former Capitulations with Poland, they shall be oblig'd to quit all the places which they now possess, and content themselves with the Limits of their own Country. VII. The Roman Catholick Monks and Fryars shall have the free Exercise of their accustom'd Functions over all the Ot∣toman Empire, according to the Capitulations and Privi∣leges formerly granted 'em, and it shall be lawful for the Embassador of Poland to make all such Demands and Remon∣strances in that respect as he shall have Orders to make from the King and Republick. VIII. Liberty of Trade shall be freely re-establish'd on both sides for all the Merchants of both Nations that have a desire to come and go with their Goods, paying only the ancient Duties, without being liable to be charg'd with new Imposts. IX. The Prisoners and Captives taken, during the War, by either side, shall be set at Liberty, paying their Ransom, which shall be settl'd according to the Oath that shall be made of it; and the Payment shall be regulated according to the Terms of the preceding Capitulations. X. All the Articles of the present Treaty shall remain in their full Force and Vigour; and in all such Points as shall require a farther Explication, Recourse shall be had to the preceding Capitulations. Moldavia and Walachia shall remain in Amity and good Understanding, as formerly; neither shall Poland give any Sanctuary to the Fugitives of those Provin∣ces. XI. All Conditions contain'd in former Capitulations are hereby confirm'd in all things that are not contrary to the Agreement of this present Treaty, and the perpetual Rights of the two Potentates, Carlowitz, January the 26th, 1699. Stanislaus Palatine of Posnania, Plenipo∣tentiary and Extraordinary Embassa∣dor from the King of Poland.
In the mean time the Imperialists used all their endea∣vours to facilitate the Treaty with the Venetians, and agreed in case their Negotiations could not be determined by the 26th,Altercations between the Venetians and Turks. the time they were to sign, they should have time given them to continue their Treaty at Constantinople, seeing the Ottoman Ministers were not willing to stay any longer at Carlowitz; This Conference was on the 16th of January, in the Presence of the Mediators, which took them up 9 Hours together: But they could not agree as to the Castle of Ro∣melia and the Mountains which cover the Isthmus of Corinth. The Venetian Embassador pretended also that Dalmatia had been annext to Albania, by the resignation of several Places which the Turks possessed, and which hindred the Republick of Ragusa from being totally separate from the Ottoman Em∣pire: But after various Contests, they rose without coming to any conclusion; and Reis Effendi declared, if they were up∣on that Lock, he would return no more to the Conferences: However, they met again on the 18th, but to no purpose, and next Day the Turks drew up a Project of a Treaty, which being imparted to Seignior Ruzzini, he declared he would not consent to it, nor depart from the Treaty proposed for the separation of the Limits. However, he dispatched a Courier to Venice about these particulars, while the Imperi∣alists in the mean time signed their Treaty, which is compre∣hended in the following Articles, An Extract of the Treaty concluded between the Emperor and the Sultan. In the Name of the Holy and Inseparable Trinity. IN perpetual Memory of the Thing. Be it notorious to all to whom it shall appertain, That after fifteen Years of a cruel War, between the Most Serene and Thrice Po∣tent Prince and Lord, Leopold, on the one side, and the Most Serene and Thrice Potent Prince and Lord, Sultan Mustapha Han, Emperor of the Turks, &c. and his Glorious Prede∣cessors, on the other; these Two Most Potent Emperors, con∣sidering how much Blood has been spilt, and how many Pro∣vinces have been laid waste; and mov'd with Compassion of the Miseries of their Subjects, and being desirous to put an end to so many Calamities, God through his Mercy has per∣mitted, that by the Mediation of the Most Serene and Most Potent Prince and Lord William III. King of Great Britain,
France and Ireland, and of the High and Mighty Lords, the States of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, both sides have condescended to conclude Solemn Treaties at Carlowitz, upon the Frontiers of both Empires, where the Mediators, the Lord William Paget, Baron of Beaudesers, and Monsieur James Collier, being assembl'd together, with the Count d'Ot∣tingen, and M. Schlick, the Imperial Plenipotentiaries, and Mehemet Effendi, Grand Chancellor of the Ottoman Empire, and Alexander Mauro Cordato, of the Noble House of the Scar∣lati, it has been agreed, &c. I. THat Transilvania should remain entire to his Imperial Majesty, with the ancient Limits, as before the War. II. That the Province of Temiswaer, with all its Appurte∣nances and Dependances, shall remain under the Ottoman Dominion, having the ancient Limits for its Bounds. That the Imperialists shall demolish Caransebes, Lippa, Czanad, Ber∣sche, Sabla, and three or four other Places, never to be refor∣tify'd by any other Treaty. The Imperialists and Turks shall enjoy, in common, the Conveniences of the Marosche, and the Teysse, whether for fishing, watering of Cattle, for the driving of Mills, or Navigation. That the Islands which his Impe∣rial Majesty has in the two Rivers, shall remain in his Pos∣session; and that the Subjects of both Empires shall be enjoin'd, under severe Edicts, to live quietly and peaceably, without injuring one the other in any manner whatever. III. That the Emperor shall enjoy the Country between the Teysse, and the Danaw, commonly call'd Batska, Titul not be∣ing to be fortify'd any otherwise then it is. IV. That a Line shall be drawn from the Extremity of the Strand, behither the Teysse, over against Titul, to the Banks of the Danaw, and another Line from the Teysse, to the River Bossut, and to the hither Shoar of Moravitz, and from thence to that part where the biggest Branch of the Bossut falls into the Save, which shall serve as Limits to both Empires. V. That part of the Save which waters those Countries surrender'd to his Imperial Majesty, shall be under his Do∣minion; and likewise that which washes the Country, re∣maining to the Grand Signior, shall be subject to the Ottoman Empire; but that part of the Save, which runs between both Empires, shall be common to both, together with the Islands therein. VI. The Limits prescrib'd by the Treaties, and those which shall afterwards be settl'd by Commissioners shall be religiously observ'd and preserv'd, without any Alteration, nor shall any Change or Alteration therein be suffer'd.
VII. Both Parties shall be at Liberty to fortifie their Fron∣tier Places, as they shall judge convenient, except such as are excepted by the Treaty. VIII. All Incursions, Invasions, Hostilities, and all sorts of Injuries shall be strictly forbidden, on both Sides, under severe Penalties, whether they may be committed openly, or in secret. IX. Nor shall it be lawful for either Party, for the future, to give any Sanctuary or Protection to wicked People, Rebels, or Malecontents. X. Nevertheless, it shall be lawful for the Transilvanians, and all others, who during the Course of the War withdrew themselves into the Ottoman Empire, there to live in Free∣dom and Security, under the Protection of his Highness. XI. But in Consideration of the Tranquility of the Fron∣tiers, and the Repose of the Subjects, it is farther agreed, That those Persons before-mention'd shall not settle them∣selves, but in Places remote from the Frontiers; and in case there happen any Disputes upon any one of the Articles of this present Treaty, an equal Number of Commissioners shall be chosen on both Sides, to determine 'em in friendly wise. XII. Prisoners taken during the War shall be exchang'd, and if there be a greater Number of the one side than the other, their Imperial Majesties shall extend their Clemency towards 'em, and release 'em, when they shall be requested so to do, by the Embassadors or Ministers residing in their Courts. As for those that are in the Power of particular Persons, they shall be permitted to ransom 'em at reasonable Rates. XIII. In respect of the Monks, and the Exercise of the Roman Catholick Religion, the Grand Signior promises to renew and confirm all Priviledges granted by his Predeces∣sors. Moreover, it shall be permitted to the Embassador of of the Most Serene and Most Potent Emperor of the Romans, to make his Complaints and Demands upon the Subject of Religion, every time that he shall receive Orders from his Master. XIV. That Trade shall be resettl'd between the Subjects of both Sides, according to the ancient Capitulations. XV. That all the Conditions stipulated in the preceding Capitulations shall be religiously observ'd in every thing, not excepted in this present Treaty. XVI. For the maintaining of a good Friendship and Cor∣repondence between the Two Empires, Embassadors shall be sent reciprocally, which shall be honourably receiv'd and treated, and they shall be permitted to demand whatever they shall think fitting.
XVII. As for the Reception of the said Embassadors, the same Rules shall be observ'd for the future, which have been observ'd for the time past, according to their Character, and they, together with their Domesticks, shall inviolably enjoy the Law of Nations. XVIII. This Peace, tho' concluded, according to the fore∣going Conditions, shall not have its full force, nor engage the Parties concern'd to observe the Laws of it, till every thing that has been stipulated on both sides, as well in regard of the Limits as the demolishing of Places be entirely per∣form'd. XIX. The Plenipotentiary Embassadors of both Empires re∣ciprocally engage themselves, and promise to procure the Ratification of their Masters upon all the Conditions of this Treaty, so that an Exchange thereof may be made by the Mediators within the space of 30 Days, to count from the Day of the Signing, or sooner if possible. XX. The Term of the present Treaty shall be Five and twenty Years, to count from the Day of Signing; and at the end of that Time, both Parties shall be at their Liberty to prolong it or not, as they shall judge most convenient for their Interests. Given at Carlowitz, at the Place of Congress under Tents, Jan. 26. 1699. Wolfgan, Count d'Ottingen. (L. S.) Leopold, Count de Schlick. (L. S.) This being effected, there remained now no other Nego∣tiation but that with Venice to be decided, which the Senate at length were brought finally to conclude on, upon the same Conditions which had been long before in a manner offered them, and which they had so long refused, to which end they sent their last Orders on the 7th of February to their Pleni∣potentiaries to agree to the following Articles.
1. THat the Morea, with all the Cities, Fortresses, Castles, Lands, Villages, Mountains, Rivers, Lakes, Woods, Ports, and generally all things else whatever, which shall be found to be comprehended within the whole Extent of the same Province, and which are now possess'd by the Repub∣lick of Venice, shall remain in the Possession, and under the Dominion of the same Republick, including the full Circum∣ference of the Country inclos'd between the Sea, and the Isthmus, in that part where still are to be seen some Remains of the ancient Wall, so that there shall be no Extension made of the Continent of the Morea into the Firm Land, beyond the Confines of the same Province. 2. In regard the Firm Land is under the Dominion of the High Empire, it shall remain entirely in the Possession of the said Empire, in the same Condition it was at the beginning of the last War. The Fortress of Lepanto shall be evacuated by the Repub∣lick of Venice, and the Castle, call'd Romelia, shall be demo∣lish'd on that side next Lepanto. The Fortress of Prevesa shall be demolish'd in like manner, and the Firm Land shall be left, on that side, in its former and entire Estate. 3. The Island of Sancta Maura, with its Fortress, and the Head of the Bridge, call'd Peraccia, not extending any far∣ther into the Firm Land, shall remain in Possession, and un∣der the Jurisdiction of the Republick of Venice. 4. The Evacuation of Lepanto, and the Demolishment of the Castle of Romelia and Prevesa, shall be perform'd im∣mediately after the Limits of Dalmatia shall be regulated; and in the mean time, to prevent all manner of Hostilities, as also to cut off all Opportunities of doing it, the Garri∣sons of the Three Places shall not stir out; they shall keep within the Fortifications of those Places, and shall not pre∣tend to do any thing, upon any Pretence whatever, without making any Incursions upon the Firm Land. The Inhabi∣tants also of the said Places shall be permitted to remain there, or depart from thence, as they shall think most con∣venient, nor shall the least Violence be offer'd to 'em. 5. The free use of the Gulphs that lie between the Firm Land and the Morea, shall be in common to both Puissances; and both the one and the other of the Two Parties oblige themselves to preserve 'em free, and to cleanse 'em from all manner of Pirates and mischivous Persons.
6. The Islands of the Archipelago, and those Seas, shall re∣main under the Dominion of the High Empire, in the Con∣dition they were in before the beginning of this last War. No Tributes, call'd Caraches, shall be exacted from the Sub∣jects of the Republick, nor any Contributions levy'd, nor any other Impositions levy'd that have been introduced dur∣ing the present War. The High Empire shall not exact for the future, from the Republick of Venice, for the Island of Zant, or from the In∣habitants thereof, any Pension for the time past, nor to come. 7. The Island of Egena, with its Fortress, lying near, and adjoining to the Morea, shall remain in her Possession, in the Condition it is at present. 8. The Fortress of Chonin, Sign, Ciclut and Gabella, seated in Dalmatia, being at present possess'd by the Republick of Venice, shall remain, for the future, under the Dominion of the same Republick, peaceably to enjoy them. But in re∣gard the Limits of that Province are to be so exactly fix'd, and so clearly, that there may be no Dispute about 'em for the future, for the Preservation of the Repose and Tranqui∣lity of the Subjects of both Parties, and to prevent all ima∣ginable Differences that may in any manner trouble the Peace of the Frontiers, it is concluded and agreed, That from the Fortress of Chonin to that of Verlica, from Verlica to Sign, from Sign to Duara, otherwise call'd Paduaria, from thence to Ver∣goraz, and from thence to the Fortress of Ciclut, and Gabella, strait Lines shall be drawn to make the Separation of the Confines, so that between the said Lines, and the Sea-Coast, all the Lands and Cantons, with the Castles, Forts, Tow∣ers, and enclos'd Places, shall be only possess'd by the Re∣publick aforesaid; and as for the Lands and Cantons that shall be without the said Line, they shall remain in Possession, and under the Dominion of the High Empire, with all the Castles, Forts, Towers, and inclos'd Places comprehended therein; nor shall it be lawful to extend or lessen the Fron∣tires of their Party. The said Lines shall be mark'd out clearly and distinctly, according to the Situation of the Place, by means of the Hills and Woods, or of the Rivers and running Waters; and where the Place shall not evidently distinguish the said Li∣mits, they shall be mark'd out by Ditches, Stakes, and Pil∣lars, as the Commissioners appointed by both Parties to re∣gulate
the Limits aforesaid, shall judge convenient. And to the end the said Fortresses which are to remain in Possession of the Republick, may have some convenient Space of Ter∣ritory before 'em, the Commissioners shall mark out about the Fortresses of Chonin, Verlica, Sign, Duara, Vergoraz, and Ciclut, such a Space of Ground as may be march'd in an Hour, in a strait Line, or Semicircle, as the Ground will permit. The Fortress of Chonin will present her Flank on that side next Croatia, as far as the Confines of the Emperor's Terri∣tories, without doing any Prejudice to the Three Potentates, whose Confines shall join to the said Limits. But they shall be oblig'd inviolably to observe the Right which belongs to every one of the Three Potentates, according to the Agree∣ments of this Universal Peace. Both Parties shall be equally bound to observe the said Line; and if it should happen, that in the Neighbourhood of the said Line, or in the Line it self, there should be any Fortress depending upon the High Empire, the Territory seated behind that Place shall remain entire to the Empire, and in Front a Space of Ground taken in the Circumference of the said Line, shall be mark'd out in a Circular Line, and which shall also have the Extent of an Hour's March. As for the Fortress of Ciclut, there shall be in like manner assign'd it in Front the Circuit of a League, without the Line, drawing out a strait Line to the Seaward; and when the Limits shall be once fix'd, and the Bounds and Territo∣ries settl'd, in Manner and Form aforesaid, they shall be in∣violably observ'd, without the least Alteration. And if any one shall have the Boldness to violate the said Bounds and Marks of the said Frontires, or to pass beyond the said Limits; or that the Officers themselves should fail in their Duty and Care in that particular, by punishing the Offenders accord∣ing to their Deserts, they shall themselves be severely pun∣ish'd, on both Sides. And in case the Commissioners shall meet with any Difficulties, or should not agree among them∣selves, they shall faithfully and exactly inform their Masters thereof, to the end such Differences may be amicably com∣pos'd by the Good Offices and Interposition of those that re∣present his Imperial Majesty, and the Lords Mediators at the Ottoman Court. 9. The Territory and Dependencies of the Signory of Ra∣gusa shall be annex'd to the Territories and Cantons of the High Empire, and all Obstacles that hinder the joining and Communication of the Lands of the said Signory, with the Lands of the High Empire, shall be taken away.
10. Castelnovo, and Lisano, which are in the Neighbour∣hood of Cattero, being actually in the Possession of the Re∣publick of Venice, she shall remain in the peaceable Enjoy∣ment of those Places and Territories. Which is likewise to be understood of some other Fortress, whatever it be, seated in that Canton, and of which the same Republick is in actual Possession. And the Commissioners which shall be chosen on both Sides, shall be Persons of known Integrity, without Passion, or private Interest, to the end they may determine this important Affair with all possible Equity, by making a Separation of the Limits of the Country, by evident and undeniable Marks. 11. The Commissioners shall give reciprocal Notice of their meeting, and shall meet in a Place proper and conveni∣ent for their Business, with an equal Number of armed At∣tendants, Men of Peace, and not given to create Trouble; and they shall begin their Conferences upon the first Day of the Equinox; that is to say, the 14/22 of March, of this pre∣sent Year now running on. 12. Neither Party shall give Sanctuary or Protection to Fugitives, on either side, but shall cause 'em to be appre∣hended and imprison'd, that they may be brought to condign Punishment. 13. Both Parties shall be permitted to repair and fortifie the Fortresses in their Possession; but not to build any new ones upon the Frontiers, not to rebuild such as are demolish'd. The Subjects also of both Parties are permitted to build Towns and Villages in order to live in Peace, and as good Neigh∣bours one with another. 14. As for what concerns Religion, the release and ex∣change of Slaves, and matter of Trade and Commerce, the Conditions of the last Treaty shall be observ'd, according to their Form and Tenor; and the Sacred Imperial Edicts, for∣merly granted to the Republick, are confirm'd by this pre∣sent Peace. 15. All Hostilities to cease from the Day of the signing the Treaty concluded between the High Empire, and the Re∣publick; and for the Information of the Governours of the Frontiers, Thirty Days are allow'd for the Provinces of Bossina, Albania, and Dalmatia, and Forty for Candy, the Morca, &c. And a general Amnesty is to be allow'd to the Subjects of
both Parties, for any Action or Crime committed during the War. 16. The Duration of this present Peace shall be determin'd upon the Delivery of the Acts of this present Treaty. By these respective Treaties may be seen the several Ac∣quisitions of the Confederates, from the Turk, during this long and bloody War, now fully terminated; How vastly the Emperor has increased his Territories, no Man that un∣derstands any thing of Geography, but must agree to it: The Poles cannot but be satisfy'd with the Restitution of Caminiec in its present State, with other Advantages: The Moscovies have been also Gainers by the Detention of Asoph and other Places and Countries leading to it; And tho' the Venetians seemed to have fared hardest in this Nego∣tiation, as indeed is usual with those who make their Terms last, witness the German Empire in the late Treaty of Rys∣wick; Yet how many strong Fortresses, and what vast Tracts of Land are hereby conceded to them, is exceeding mani∣fest, the Morea (to say nothing of the rest) wherein there had been so many famous Kingdoms and States, being now entirely theirs: So that upon the whole, if you consider the Extent of Land, the Fertility of the Soil, and the Num∣bers and the Strength of the Garrisons which the Turks have lost, and set them against the Nakedness of their Fron∣tiers, the cold Climate of Thrace, the Barrenness of Macedon and other Parts, and indeed against the whole they have now left in Europe; It will appear they lost little less than one Moiety of their Dominions on this side the Tracian Bos∣phorus, and I cannot think a Truce of Five and Twenty Years will be sufficient to put them into a Condition to re∣gain them again, but should rather incline to believe that another War should drive them over to the Asiatick Shoar, as a step on their way to those Barren Desarts from whence they first came. But while this our European World may now justly sing a Rquiem for the Universal Peace that is establish'd between the several Nations, that compose its Inhabitants, what a pitty is it, and how worthy of La∣mentation, that the poor Protestants abroad should fare the worse for it, their Calamities encrease, and as it were a new War proclaimed against them both in France, Savoy and Germany (I wish we may not hear the same in a short time from Hungary and Trasilvania) from the foolish Bigottry of those Princes, whose true Interest it is to protect and tole∣rate them, and who after all can never sit easie in their Throes, nor one should think, in their Consciences neither, till they have learnt that true Principle, that Conscience is
not to be forced in Matters of Religion, and so regulate their Actions accordingly: But however it may prove with these of the Popish Communion, and how rigorously they may be still bent to extripate that which they mis-call by the Name of Heresie, and how great soever the Demerit of our Suffering Brethren may be, the general and solemn Days of Humiliation and Prayers appointed for their Deliverance by almost the Universal Authority of all the Protestant Princes and States of Europe, is one good sign that their Sal∣vation draweth nigh.
