John Parker to be Drawn and Hang'd for High Treason, Benjamin Pennery for Robbing on the High-way, Francis Ad∣kins for picking of Pockets, John Dell and Richard Dean For stealing a Mare, and Susan White and Deborah Rogers for Felony. With the manner of their Facts by them Com∣mitted. AT the Sessions holden at the Old-Bayly, on Wednesday the 10th of this instant December, and ended on Saturday the 13th. There were 11 miserable Offenders that Received Sentence of Death, but the never failing mercies of a Gracious Prince out of his tender Compassion to his miserable Subjects, Graciously Reprieved 17 of them, the rest being 7. suffered on Fryday the 19th. following The first in this fatal Catastrophy was John Parker a Watch∣maker formerly living in Redlion-Court in Fleët-street, who being Indicted for High Treason, was Arraigned and found Guilty of the same, it being prov'd against him, that he had for many years counterfeited the Currant and lawful Coin of England, stamping Adulterated Mettals, as Brass, Block Tin, Copper and the like,
and after Guilding, put it off to the full vallue of the true and lawful Coin, bearing the proportionable, as Mill'd half-Crowns Crowns, Brummijum Groats, Broad Gold and Guinnies but that which was most admirable, was his taking out the C's from between the Bars of Mill'd Shillings, and engraving Scepters in the Room of them, that when double Guilded, they might well deceive a skilful Mony-Monger, with these he used to ride into the Country, and there put them away, especially into Bucking∣ham-shire, where it was proved he did distribute many, he also did extend his Art to the making several sorts of Forraign Coins as Ducatoons, pieces of Eight, and the like, these several false monies with a basket of his Tools, viz. his flask refining pots and Stamps, being shewed in open Court the Fellony and Trea∣son being proved against him he received the dreadful Sentence To return from whence he came, and thence to be drawn upon a Hur∣dle to the place of Execution, there to be half strangled, his Privi∣ties Cut off, his Bowels to be burnt his Head severed from his Body, and his Quarters to be disposed of as his Majesty pleased, on this day the same was put in Execution, his Repentance was well as beseemed a Christian, behaving himself meekly and submis∣sive, as well in Prison, as at the place of Execution, shewing by many Emblems a hearty sorrow for his Crimes, and much be∣wailing his mis-spent time, advising all, even to the last moment of his Life, to be cautious in their ways, and not to be tempted with Desires of such unlawful Gain, lest they like him, should bring themselves to the like painful and shameful end. The next was Benjamin Pennery, a notorious High-way-man, having for a long time followed those unlawful Enterprises, at last intangled in the Snares of Justice, was justly brought to suf∣fer for his Crimes, for he in the Company of three more setting upon a Coach upon Bagshot-Heath, in Bark-shire, wherein was one Captain Palmer and three or four Gentlewomen, at their first coming up they fired into the Coach, and shot the said Cap∣tain through the Arm, after rifling him and his Company, yet got no greater Booty, than two or three half-shirts, some other necessary Linnen; a Pistol, and forty Shillings in mony, the Shirts and Pistol being sometime after offered by Penneries wife to Sail, were known, and she apprehended, who bringing out her Hus∣band, he alledged he had them of one French, who was hang'd the last Sessions, but there being farther Testimony given against him, by one Hix, that had been formerly of the same Gang, that he had been in his Company in several Robberies, at the Robbing
several Carriers near Barnet of several parcels of goods and mo∣neys and whas was more, that they once cheated him of his Snack and therefore left their Company, and had since im∣peached many of the Gang, for these Enormities, he received Sentence of Death, his Behaviour was resolute, little regarding the Admonitions of the Court as to a Preparation to Eternity, nor yet in Prison, to such as gave him good Instructions; But when the fatal moment was at hand, that he unavoidably must appear before the dreadful Throne of an Almighty Judg to Answer for his Actions here below, his Conscience was awaken∣ed, and he declared a hearty sorrow for his Sins, casting up his Eyes and Hands to Heaven and uttering many admonishing words, unto the multitude, so continuing till he changed for Immortallity. The next were those notorious cruel Companions in Iniquity, viz. John Dell of Edger, and Richard Dean, they having no less than three Indictments laid against them, the first for Mur∣dering Dells Wife, the second for murdering Daniel Ball his Father in Law, the third for stealing a Mare, but by reason there could be nothing proved positively against them on the two first, they were brought in not Guilty. But to see how just Heaven is, notwithstanding they had escaped for committing those barba∣rous crimes, yet both he and his confederate were Condemned for stealing a Mare, sold by Dean, and justified by Dell. After the fatal sound of Death had made Impression on their Souls, and their Consciences awakened from the drowsie Lether∣gy or seared hardness that the many dreadful Crimes by them committed had inured them to, and they began to gaze upon a vast Eternity and inward feelings of the mighty Guilts, seeing themselves plunged into the depth of Misery, began most seri∣ously to Repent; they being kept assunder that they might the better unburthen their Censciences, to those Ministers that came to exhort them for the good of their immortal Souls, they both shewed abundance of sorrow and contrition for the manifold and grievous Sins they had committed, Dell declaring that his crying Sins had provoked the Almighty God to give him over to him∣self, and therefore he had run into such distructive ways, for that he had for the most part defrauded or cheated whomsoever he had any thing to do withal, the Minister desired him to confess if he were conscious of the horrid Murders he stood charged withal, to which he answered very doubtfully, saying he had ma∣ny great and grievous Sins, which like lead pressed down his
Soul, and stopping there let fall some Tears, desiring all to Pray for mercy to his Soul, and farther, that he hoped God would not lay to his Charge the Cruelty he used towards his Wife, and in a dubious manner did confess the Crime. Dean like∣wise was exceeding penitent, saying that Dell had brought him to this shameful End, so they continued at the place of Executi∣on, desiring the Great God of Heaven and Earth, to pardon their great Offences, and that all would take warning by their fatal Ends. The next was Francis Adkins, a notorious Pickpocket, who was commonly used to commit that villanous Act in Churches, and other publick resorts, and when he observed the People did not Watch as well as Pray, he would be sure to dive into their Pockets; But having picked the Pocket of one Mr; Stephens of about eight or nine shillings in Bow-Church, but he was appre∣hended ere he could dispose of the monies, and several remark∣able pieces found about him, at the same time another having his pocket picked of six or seven shillings, who coming in where he found some of his monies likewise, so that in Court it being pro∣ved that he had been in Newgate several times, and an old offen∣der, was found Guilty, and received Sentence of Death. During the respit for preparing himself for another World he greatly bewailed his mis-spent time, and desired the Charitable Prayers of all good Christians, and exhorted all to a timely Re∣pentance, and to desire the Mercy of a never failing God before they came to stand upon the Brink of Eternity, &c. The next were Susanna White, and Deborah Rogers, for steal∣ing a Silver Tankard from one Mr. Sparkle of St. Martins in the Fields, the former had been a notorious Shoplift, and was thought to bring the latter into this preminire, the Tankard was found in her Basket, the Fellony was plain, and they received Sentence, after which, they infinitely bewailed themselves, de∣siring Mercy from above, and Pardon for all their Sins, and so they all departed this Life, to Answer for their particular Offences, before the Tribunal of the great God. PINIS.
