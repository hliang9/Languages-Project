HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms ❧ By the King. ❧ A Proclamation for the ordering of Tobacco. THe Kings most Excellent Maiestie, and His Royall Father of blessed memory, hauing at seuerall times and vpon seuerall occasions, published their Proclamations concerning Tobacco, as well that which hath beene indeauoured to bee planted within this Realme, as that which is of the growth of Virginia and the Sommer Islands, and other English Colonies and Plantations, and also concerning Spanish and o∣ther forraigne Tobacco; And finding that the inordinate desire of ta∣king Tobacco, and the unmoderate thirst of gaine, by the planting and selling of Tobacco, cannot otherwise be allayed or moderated; Hath at the last, by the aduice of His Priuie Counsell, determined vpon this fi∣nall resolution touching all sorts of Tobacco, in manner following. First, His Maiestie doth heereby declare His Royall Pleasure to be, and doth heereby Will and Command, that no person whatsoeuer doe at any time heereafter, plant, cherish, or preserue any Tobacco, within these His Realmes of England or Ireland, or Dominion of Wales, or any the Isles, parts, or places, of, or belonging to them or any of them, and if any bee now planted or growing there, that the same bee presently plucked vp and vtterly destroyed, by the Owners, Planters, Tenders, or Dressers thereof, and lest they or any of them, should aduenture to neglect the per∣formance heereof, His Maiestie doeth further straitly charge and command all Constables, Ty∣thing-men, Headboroughs, and other Officers within their seuerall limits and Iurisdictions, carefully and effectually to see the same executed and performed accordingly. And His Maiestie doth further Will and Command all Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Sheriffes, and other principall Officers in their seuerall places, within the compasse of their seuerall Iurisdictions and authori∣ties, vpon complaint to them made, to cause the same to be duly performed and executed without partialitie, as they and euery of them will answere their contempts in that behalfe at their vtter∣most perils. And that the Tobacco of His Maiesties owne Plantations and Colonies may not bee planted and imported hither without limitation or measure, or vnder colour thereof, the Tobacco of the growth of Spaine and other forraigne parts, may not be brought into these His Realmes, or sold or vttered heere, to the ouerthrow of His Colonies abroad, and to the wasting of the wealth and treasure of His Kingdomes at home. His Maiestie doeth further Will and straitly Command, that no person whatsoeuer doe at any time heereafter import any Tobacco of the growth of Spaine, and other forraigne parts out of His owne Dominions, nor sell, vtter, or offer to sell, or vt∣ter, or otherwise dispose or keepe any such Tobacco, to the intent to sell or vtter the same without His Maiesties speciall Commission in that behalfe, vpon paine of confiscation and forfeiture there∣of, in whose hands soeuer the same shall be found, and vpon such further paines and penalties, as by the Lawes of these His Realmes, or by His Prerogatiue Royall which in this case He will not admit to be disputed, may be inflicted vpon the offendors.
And because such forraigne Tobacco, may not be receiued and vttered, vnder the pretence of the Tobacco of the growth of Virginia, the Summer-Ilands, and other Colonies and Plantations, vnder, and within His Maiesties owne Dominions, nor the Planters, Owners, or Aduenturers, of, and in these Plantations, giue themselues ouer to the planting of Tobacco onely, to make a present returne of profit, and neglect to applie themselues to solide Commodities fit for the esta∣blishing of Colonies, which will vtterly destroy these and all other Plantations; His Maiestie doth further will and command, that from henceforth no Tobacco of the growth of Virginia, the Summer-Ilands, or any other Plantations, or Colonies, of, or within His owne Dominions, bee imported into these his Realmes or Dominions, or any the Ports, Hauens, Creekes, or places thereof, without His Maiesties especiall licence in that behalfe, vnder the great Seale of Eng∣land, and that vpon the importation thereof, the same bee deliuered into the hands of such Com∣missioners, for his Maiesties owne immediate vse, as His Maiestie vnder His great Seale of England shal appoint, at, & for such Prices and Rates to be paid for the same, as shall be reasonably agreed vpon, betweene the Owners or Factors of the same, and the Kings Commissioners on His Maiesties behalfe, or if they shall not agree thereon, then to be transported againe, and sold elsewhere, vpon paine of confiscation and forfeiture thereof, and vpon such further paines and penalties, as by the Law, or His Maiesties Prerogatiue Royall may be inflicted vpon them. And further His Maiestie doth straitly charge and command, that no person whatsoeuer pre∣sume to buy any sort of Tobacco, within these Realmes or Dominions, or any Hauen, Port, Creeke, or place thereof, of any other person, then of His Maiesties Commissioners onely to bee authorised vnder the great Seale of England, as aforesaid, and after the same shall bee sealed with a Seale to that purpose appointed, and that they, vpon the buying thereof, doe expresse the true time when the same was bought, the quantitie and qualitie thereof, in and by a note in wri∣ting indented betweene the Buyer and Seller, testifying the same vpon the paines and penalties aforesayd, And if during these times of Hostility, and Tobacco shall bee imported by any of his Maiesties owne Shippes, or by the Ships of any of his Subiects, by way of Prize, or Letters of Marque, his further will and pleasure is, that all such Tobacco shall be deliuered vnto his Maiesties Com∣missioners, at, and for reasonable prices, to bee accomptable therefore to his Maiesties vse. And his Maiestie doeth hereby straitly charge and command, all Customers, Controllers, Searchers, Wayters, and all other Officers, Ministers, of, or belonging to His Customes, And also all Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Sheriffes, Constables, and other Our Officers, Ministers and louing Subiects, in their seuerall places and degrees, to take knowledge of this his Royall pleasure and Commandement, and to bee ayding, helping and assisting to His Maie∣sties Commissioners, and their Deputies, Factors and seruants, in all things touching and concer∣ning this His Seruice, whereof his Maiestie is resolued to require a due and strict accompt. Giuen at His Maiesties Court at Windsore, the ninth day of August in the third yeere of His Reigne of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland. God saue the King. ¶Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton and Iohn Bill, Printers to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. M.DC.XXVII.
