FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE Woollen Manufacture OF ENGLAND. VVHEREAS, Till within few Years last past, there hath been a very great Con∣sumption of Wool used in making of Set-work Cushions for Chairs, Couches, Carpets called Turky-work made in York-shire; Great quantities of Cloth Serges, Perpetuanoes, Kerseys, Camblets, Nor∣wich Chenys, Bays, Kidderminster prints, Says and Cottons, and all other Commodities of the Woollen Manufacture: As also many Bales of Silk wrought up into Fringes for Chairs, and divers bales of Russia Lea∣ther wrought up into Chairs, which is the product of our Cloth from Turkey and Russia, whereby many Thousand Families have been Employed and maintain∣ed. All which Manufactures have been generally laid aside and little made use of, to the ruine of many Families. It is therefore Humbly Prayed that this Honourable House will ac∣cording to their great Wisdom provide, That all Couches and Squobs under the value of four pounds, and all Chairs and Stools under the value of Twenty shillings a piece, (except such as are made of Leather) may not be Backt, Bottomed, Covered, Cased, or made with any thing but what is of the Woollen Manufacture or the Growth of England.
