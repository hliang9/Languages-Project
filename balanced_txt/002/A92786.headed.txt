The Epistle to the Reader. True-hearted Countrymen, THe Poland Ambassador in the yeare of our Lord 1619. delivering his Speech at White-hall before K. Iames, and the Lords of his Privy Councel, cra∣ving aid against the barbarous invasion of the Turks into Poland, began his message with these words, Erupit tan∣dem Othomanorum virus, i. e. The poyson of the Othoman Family is at length burst out against the famous Kingdom of Poland; the same may be said of the Hollander, Erupit tandem Belgarum virus in Angliam, the Dutch poyson is at last burst out against England; this Cocatrice egg 'tis ho∣ped will quickly be crushed, and their Spiders web, which subtilly and finely they have been weaving to enthral this Nation, will as suddainly be broken: They gave (as 'tis said of Nepthali) fair and goodly words, but war was in their hearts, they spake by their Ambassadors peace, but as the Prophet David saith, they then made them ready to battell. Oh my loving Countrymen! should I but in part relate to you what we have done for them, and now, notwith∣standing all their fa r and plausible pretences of love to us, how basely, unjustly, and perfidiously have they re∣quired us, Gods just proceedings against them, and their own guilty consciences and spirits now struck with a∣mazement and horror, with faintnesse and divisions, doe sufficiently evidence. To speak a little to this point, (not too much to boast of our good acts done for this people) as to vindicate our in∣nocency
and love towards them) though if any have just cause to glory, much more we; for what have they, which either our valour, bloud, and charity have not kept for them, or bestowed on them? have they a rich country, but was not the Duke of Alua Master of it, till our English re∣giments beat him out? have they fine Townes? but had not their enemies the gates, and walls, and canon, and all, till forc'd to surrender and yeeld up to our English swords? have they wives and children? but were they not preser∣ved by our true-hearted affection? have they the Prote∣stant Religion, and the preaching of Gods Word amongst them, and may they freely hear it? but was it not the Eng∣lish that drove the Popish Faction out of their Confines? on all this may be said to and against these insolent, though by their own confession formerly, the poore di∣stressed estates, yea and much too, and yet but truly, with∣out our Seas how could they fish? without our Harbours how would they subsist? without our cloth how could they be warm? without our coals how could they work or form any instrument of war? without our grain of all sorts (though too much unjustly transported) how could they eat or drink without our gold and silver (though basely carried over) how could they florish? what sums of mo∣neys, and those vast ones too, have they drained out of England, by pretending to drain our Fens, though indeed their main plot was to have setled themselves along the Sea Coasts, to have given way for an invasion to their own friends and countrymen, and all this might have been done with case, under the colour of fishing, as things and times went then, had they been prepared for it, 'twas not for want of will, but of power, they were then packing their cards to play their game as fast as they could, had not their craftinesse been in due time discovered.
Upon these and many other weighty inducements have I set this book out for my Countrymen to read and judge; 'tis true, and but necessary and convenient for our times, the Dutch now being executing to their utmost against this Commonwealth, what they for many years have been contriving; and to the speedier effecting their bloudy and inhumane intendments against us, have woven with some, interwoven with others, and counterwove with divers States and Princes, by all ways and means possible to ru∣ine us, that they may rule alone, whom God (his glorious name be praised) hath as yet hindred, and overthrown. Accept therefore I desire you of my true and just la∣bours in discovering this subtill and bloudy peoples in∣tendments, and let us all joyn in one to strike while the i∣ron is hot, with our prayers, persons, and purses, freely and liberally to endeavour to conquer them, who would conquer us, and to reduce the Dutch, and force them to obedience, who would, if they could, ruine England, and force it to slavery or slaughter by their Belgick Lions Paw, or the Orange Van Trump. Valete.
The Seas Magazine opened. IT's confess'd and known, that no man is so far his owne, but that both kindred and friends, and more especially the Com∣monwealth which bred him, and keeps him, may challenge to her, and their use and imployment, the best and utmost of his reallest abilities, either of nature or art. I being fully convinced and satisfied thereupon, did conclude, that this subject of the Dutch intentions and practises, to ingrosse all trade through Eu∣rope, and the other parts of the world into their own hands; and to that purpose have used their utmost endeavours (per fas, & no∣fas) by right or wrong, to ingratiate themselves into the favour and league of the mightiest Princes of the world, working in some by pretext of Religion, in others by presents and promises of As∣sistance, in some by gainfulnesse of trading, and benefit of cu∣stomes, in others by false and corrupted Courtiers, by bribes, in all by their outward apparent strength at Sea, and richnesse and vari∣ety of commodities: for the surer accomplishment of most of these their deep woven designes, they have not wanted two main helps from this Nation of England for many yeares together; first the too too much indulgence, favour, and protection of the two late Kings, who either being too weak in judgment, or pur-blinded by rewards, or some other indirect and oblique meanes, did take all for truth, which was by deceiptfull Courtiers suggested to them: Secondly, by the former gaining the latter of their intend∣ments, to wit, their unlimited and licentious trade of fishing in our Seas, with freedom of all our Ports, but not the last, viz an inva∣sion, which if it had been a little longer forborn, would have ren∣dred them who are scarce good enough to be our Associates, much lesse our brethren, to have become the most insulting and inso∣lentest invaders, and Tyrants, both of our lives and liberties, and of all other things accompted precious and dear to us, and ours, and all this done and effected, while our Nation was in a deluded lethargy of peace and security, as from these their seeming friends, but reall and inveterate enemies, as is too too apparent to all the world at this day. This subject therefore concerning the Dutch free fishing, with the excessive gains and advantages made by them upon our Seas,
as also their subtill and insinuating ingrossing all trade into their Chambers and Exchequers, with their further intentions of rui∣ning our Nation, with some directions how timely to prevent all these, and to force them to obedience, for they deserve to be ser∣vants, or slaves, and not Masters of their betters. This subject, I hope, wil give reall contentment to all true hearted Englishmen, and other well-wishers to our Commonwealth, concerning the particulars included, and first of their fishing. The Herring, Cod, and Ling, and other fish which the Hollanders take in our Seas, is valued to be well worth yeare∣ly, being cast and saved, forty hundred thousand pounds; the Hollander he is so provident and industrious a Nation, as he is too neere a Neighbour to be Master of the Seas be∣longing to this Commonwealth, for though they have not Beeves to serve themselves, yet do they supply their wants yearly out of Denmark, three or four thousand at a drove; neither have they corne growing in their owne country to sustaine them more then two parts of the year, but have their corn out of Dansk, and other Eastern countryes. Further, they have no timber to build the fifth part of their shipping which they have, and do build, but fetch their timber from the river of Rhyne, and other Eastern parts; neither have they commodities within their own Provinces to maintain the trade of the fifth part of their shipping which they have builded, but do supply their Navigation with these commodities out of this Com∣monwealth, to wit, Sea-coal, Batter, Cheese, Tallow, and Calve skins, Lead, Tyn, and Iron Ordnance, and many times they secret∣ly transport Broadcloaths and Kersies; our Wheat also they will buy when it is cheap, and sell Wheat unto us when it is dear; for fish, they have from the Seas belonging to this Commonwealth, as Herring, Cod, Ling, Salmon, Stake, Conger, Dase, Buck-horne, Rayes, and Fewmathers, an infinite number; these commodities support their Navigation, make them rich and strong by Sea and Land, and enables them to maintain wars by Sea and Land, where∣as if we would be so industrious as to transport this Merchandize, they would inrich our Nation, and make our Commonwealth more strong, and more feared at Sea, and advance the customes and yearly revenues of this Commonwealth. They may be named the golden seas that surround our famous Isle of Great Brittaine, for there are not three Kings in Christen∣dom that have so rich a blessing of God of fish in the Seas, as this
Commonwealth, and with so temperate a climate for the preser∣ving and saving thereof wet and dry; for besides the forenamed fish taken at Yarmouth, & the Coasts of Scotland, which is a very great and rich treasury unto the Hollander; there are betweene this Commonwealths Territories of England, Scotland, and Ire∣land, Hake, Cod, Ling, Herring, Pilchers, and Conger, a plentifull blessing of God, and no great profit rais'd unto this Common∣wealth, for that there is not any effectuall way pursued for the taking and saving of the said fish, for want of money to buy small Bk, Sal, and Cordage, Nets, Huers, and Spillers, all which are necessary, and must be provided, if the said fishing shall be set for the best advantage and good of this Commonwealth. The Hollanders have been too bold formerly to enter into the fishing of the Western Seas, and I have observed; and cannot learn in all the West country, that there are above threescore small Barks that imploy themselves in taking the said Hake, Cod, and Ling, and other fih in the said Seas, whereas if there were three thousand Vessells, there is fish enough within those seas for them all, the plentifull blessings of God thereof are so infinite, so long as we receive them thankfully, and we can no more lessen the blessed gifts of God given unto this Commonwealth, in these kinds of fish, then we can the depth and vastnesse of the Seas, by carrying any part thereof to be powred into Loughs, Pools, and Ponds, if true use were made of these blessings of God, the people of this Commonwealth would have the like or more traffick to transport this fish, then now the Hollanders have had, and would encrease the strength and multitude of shipping of this Commonwealth, to exceed all other Nations The Hollanders are so laborious of taking the fish within these our seas, and so provident to vent the same, and I hear Travellers say, that there is not a Port or Harbour in all the Streights, or o∣ther vendible Ports, but the Hollanders have trade, and that name∣ly in Naples and Florence, hath been sold of red Herring, to the value of two hundred thousand pounds in one year, and as I have ben informed, they have made twelve hundred thousand pounds of these and oher kind of fish sold within the Territories of this Commonwealth? then how many hundred thousand pounds more do they make in other Ports and Creeks in the Strights, of Ger∣many, France, Spain, and Portugal, wh y had trade with them, and many other Kingdoms, besides great quantity spent for their own use in the Netherlands, the whole amounting by esti∣mation to four millions. per annum.
If the Hollanders refuse to agree to such Proposals as shall be for a sure and well grounded Peace, and for the safety of this Commonwealth, and do not withdraw themselves from fishing in our Seas, then (God assisting us) such a course may be undertaken to reduce them to an Agreement, and force them from fishing in our Seas, without any hazard or danger to the Navy of this Commonwealth, and I presume that they will also to enjoy the favour of this Commonwealth deliver into our hands Flushing, and the Brill, as pledges for their fi∣delity; this may seem strange with many that are not acquaint∣ed with Martial Affairs, and I do confess, if I give not rea∣sons, and perform what I have said (God giving a blessing) I am unworthy to be hearkened unto. But if any will ask me how these things should be accom∣plished? I answer, That the King of Spain that hath the known rich Mines of Silver and Gold, hath nevertheless coyn∣ed brass money, the French King hath likewise a great quan∣tity, the Emperour and Sweadland, and many other Kingdoms, Dukedoms, and Provinces, which they all find commodious, otherwise would they not use the same. Note. Now we have in the West-Country a mettal called Mandyck, and Sinder-Tin, which is harder then the Pewter-Tin, and little less softer and fairer then Silver; if the Parlia∣ment please to coyn the same into two-pences, it will be a great help for the accomplishing the same, and with a provi∣dent care bring all this to a period in a short time, and raise unto this Commonwealth 400000 l. per Annum, which will maintain the Navie, and supply many other occasions. This being providently persevered in, and brought unto a period, will give imployment and relief to the poor which beg their bread, which willingly will be imployed therein, and remove the poverty and idleness of the people of this Commonwealth, and will not be offensive to any. 'Tis true, That there are many wholsom laws to set the poor at work, and Overseers in every parish appointed, who re∣ceiving not any benefit by their labor, do look over them, but not on them, so that the poor live still in idleness; for where there is a good Law not executed, that Law is as a desolate
City, dispeopled, whereas the poor being employed in this fishing Craft, the fisher-men for their own gain, will not on∣ly instruct the poor in that Craft, but also do their best endea∣vours therein for the good of them all. If those that sit at the Helm shall please to approve thereof, then it followeth that a convenient sum of this money be de∣livered unto every Corporation, or Parish near to the Sea, who shall give security for the same, and for the imployment there∣of, for the setting forth of this fishing. I do not express my knowledge to maintain this unhappy discord between the two Commonwealths of England, and Holland, but leave it to the consideration of the Parliament to use their wisdom, and when it shall please God to stir the same, but I hold it a greater glory to obtain victory and safety by peace, then to gain victory and safety by victory, and that may appear, that the Hollanders can no better prosper in her adventures at sea, without succour of our Harbours, then can an Army lying in the field in cold, frosty, and tempestuous weather without shelter and comfort; as for Example, of the Hollanders Fleet return from the East, or West-Indiaes, Ginny, or Binny, which are very long voyages, their victual near spent, and their Mariners some sick, some dead, and others weak, ariving in St Georges Channel, meet with a contrary wind, as many times they do, they must of necessity return into the Seas, unless they have the benefit of our Harbours, which often times I have found by experience, and especially at one time returning from a long voyage, and the first Land I made in the Evening, was the Point of the Lyzard, where there arose a South-East Storm, whereupon we were con∣strained to tack about, and could bear no Sail for the greatness of the Storm, but lay in drift before the wind, and were dri∣ven eight hundred Leagues to the Lee-ward, before the wind was fair to return. Note. Now the Hollanders East-Indy Fleet, or any other of their long voyages, when their victuals are neer spent, their men some dead, some sick, some weak, and run sixty seven or eight hundred Leagues to the Lee-wards, how hardly can their ships, being so feebly man'd, and victual'd, return again with
safety, I leave it to the judgment of the Saylors of the great∣est experience; when the wind blows fair at the South-West, and by South, any of these winds will lead the Hollanders in∣to the Harbours of Falmouth, Plymouth, and any other of our Western-Ports, but not into Flushing, or any other of their own Ports, or Harbours, then must they of necessity ply on and off in our Seas, where if they be taken with a great storm with any of the said winds, which often arise, they are all cast away, unless they be miraculously preserved. Note. Again, if the Hollanders pretend a long voyage, and set forth one hundred Sail, more or less, as many times they do, and recover neer the Mouth of St Georges Channel, and meet any the aforesaid stormy winds, they are all likewise in great peril of shipwrack, or if they went with a Western wind, West, South-West, or West, and by North, they are then forced to return home-wards again; whereas if they have the succour of our Western-Ports, their voyage is half made, so must they be constrained to seek succor at our hands, & then may we drive them to what Composition we please: if the Hollanders should lose the benefit of our Harbors, I am verily perswaded, they would grow weaker in seven years, in their strengh, and riches by Sea, by reason of shipwrack, then they have gained in fourteen years formerly past; and now as they have decla∣red themselves enemies by their open Hostility upon us, they will seek all advantages against us to destroy us, as enemies; but if through a seeming amity, they can any way gain their pristine priviledges in our Harbours, then this inconvenience may ensue, they having the liberty to harbour their ships in the Havens and Ports of this Commonwealth, as for example, I have known where there hath at the Harbours of Faymouth sundry times arrived, three hundred and odd sail in one Storm, which without the succour of our Harbours, must of necessity be all cast away; they might then, and hereafter may the like number, if not prevented, sail so far into that Harbour, and likewise into our Harbour of Falmouth, as to come to an An∣chor free from the Common-shot, and then if such evil should be in them, as to joyn with the Emperor, or some other King, they may land 30. or 40000. Souldiers without resistance,
for their Ships carrying 5 or 6000 peeces of Ordnance will batter the shoare together with small shot, the Harbors being narrow, as that they may land without resistance, and so spoil the Country, and hazard the surprisal of the Castles, whereof one of them is to be made impregnable in a short time, which if an enemy should possess (as God forbid) then will they command that Harbor to the great anoyance of the Merchant Adventurers of London. The French King to avoyd the like danger suffers no English Ship to corne near the City of Burdeux, but first lades their Ord∣nance at the City of Bloy, a league from the City; moreover, he takes of every English Ship fiften shillings for as many tuns as she contains: Now if the Prliament will please to command, that every forreign Ship o land their Ordnance at their first arri∣val in any Bay of the Ports of this Commonwealth, it will avoyd the danger formerly mentioned, and yield to this Nation a year∣ly r venue of a 100000 l. for their Shipping cannot bark with∣out mouth, nor bite without teeth. Now this inconvenience being thus avoyded, and that we may have a sure Commanding peace with them in all humility, I propose this, that the Hol∣landers deliver unto us Flushing, and the Brill, and also give unto this Commonwealth four millions current English Mony, which they may give, or raher pay, for that they have gained many four millions out of our seas without license, in consideration where∣of if the Parliament will be pleased to grant them license to fish for Herring, Cod, and Ling, for 21 years in our Seas, where they did usually fish; as also they may have the use and benefit of our Harbors as heretofore, and that without landing their Ordnance; and this I conceive under Correction will be the best submissive agreement that ever they made, and a good assurance unto this Nation that no Invasion shall be attempted by them or any other into any of this Commonwealths Territories: This the Parlia∣ment may force them to doe, if they please; or otherwise beat them out all their Trade they have in Christendom: Yet many will say, they are too mighty in shipping to be dealt withall; Notwithstanding God assisting us, though it may be supposed we are not so numerous in shipping, yet with that strength we have it may be made good; for policy and advantage of ground in
wars doth sundry times gain the victory with few against many: this may be accomplished with little expence & hzard of the Navy, for the very Rocks and Clifts shall humble them, unless miraculously God preserve them. But how grateful this will be unto the Hollanders, as the case now stands, I leave it to themselves; but if they understood their own good, to have such a Neighbour-Commonwealth as we are, to be as their Protectours; and if they reflect back, we have been so, whose favour or displeasure doth concern them more then any King or Emperour whatsoever, and how conducible the considera∣tion thereof will be to other Nations in matter of trade with us, I leave to the judgment and excellent wisdom of those po∣litical Pilots, and steers-men of this Commonwealth; and though fifteen shillings a tun, as is before mentioned, be too great an Imposition, but only to constrain the Hollanders to yield up Flushing and the Brill into our hands, which doubt∣less they will, rather then they will lose the benefit of fishing, and succour of our Harbours; for they know so much, that the Kingdoms of France, Spain, and Portugal, have not so many good Harbours, as this Nation of England hath, for the preservation of shipping; by reason whereof the Common∣wealth is at a great charge of Garisons, powder and shot, without which the Merchant Adventurers ships arriving in our Harbours, would be in far greater danger to be robb'd with Turks, and Piats, then when they are at Sea; and therefore I think agreeable with reason, the Hollanders having submit∣ted themselves as aforesaid, that every forraign Ship that ar∣rives in our Harbours, should pay twelve pence upon every Tun she contains, the rather for that they came not to traf∣fick with this Nation, but only to save Lives, and Ships, and Goods, from being cast away in tempestuous weather, the benefit whereof may be yearly worth to this Nation ten thou∣sand pounds. Note. Now if the Hollanders refuse to yield obedience, then here ensueth an expression and direction how to subdue them, or force them to obedience. But first observe, That from all parts of Christendom where they have any trade, they ply homewards about Michaelmas, for that in the cold of
Winter, they cannot enter their Harbours for ice, and in this their return homewards, they are many times taken with con∣trary winds in Saint Georges Channel, which constrains them to take succour in our Harbours, and Ports, where many times there will arrive one after another, three or four hundred Sail, which thus arriving some one day, some another, they may easily be surprised, the first surprising the second, the second, the third, and fourth, and so possessing two or three hundred Sail, there will be wealth enough to defray the charge, and sufficient strength to make an absolute Conquest in this man∣ner, to wit, Take one hundred and ten Sail of the best warlike Ships of them, which being added unto fifty Sail of our Ships, former∣ly mentioned, will make eightscore Sayl, plying on and off in St Georges Channel, there can no ships pass East, or West, but may be surprised by the said eightscore Sail: now admit that the Hollanders set forth a stronger or weaker Fleet to fight with them, then for that we may not hazard the loss of men and ships, I wish that these eightscore sail may return into our own Harbours, and I hold it an honourable retreat to charge again with greater advantage. Now the Hollanders Fleet must ply on and off in St Georges Channel, until the next storm, which if it shall arise at South-West, or Southerly wind, they are like to be cast away, without the succour of our Harbour; for under the Coast of France, which will be the Lee-shore, they cannot safely come to an Anchor, for that the Sands are loose, and will not hold their Anchors, and the Rocks so sharp, and lie so far into the sea, as will cut their Cables: if the storm arise in the West, or Westernly winds, then are they dri∣ven home again; if the storm arise in the East, or Easternly winds, they are driven into the seas, where they will be wea∣ther-beaten, their men tired with labour, some Ships spend their Masts, break the Yards, and lose their Rudders, or spring a Plank; but however they are all dispersed, some here, and some there, and cannot give directions to joyn together a∣gain, and so are in a far worse case then a great Ar∣my in the Field, which many times are overcome with a few.
This Storm being now appeased, and our Navy of eight-score sail setting forward out of the Harbours, dividing themselves into four Squadrons, making towards these di∣stressed and distracted Fleets, shall meet with them severally, plying homewards, which may easily be surprized without hazard of our Navy, and this being observed will beat them from all their trade. Thus much concerning the discourse of the submissive obedience of the Hollanders, which being ef∣fected, will give us an absolute Command over them, which on the contrary, if we suffer them to climb to the height of their ambition, which no King nor Emperour can prevent, they will increase so great a strength, as that the French K ng shall not vent his wines, the Spaniard his Sacks, Fruits, and Sugars, into the cold Countries, where they are most ven∣dible, but by transportation of the Hollanders, neither shall either of these Kings have out of the Eastern Countryes, Ca∣bles, Cordage, Tar, and Pitch, Masts, Yards, or Deals, Corn, and other Commodities, but from the hands of the Hollanders, thereby they will engross the trade of Christen∣dome into their own hands, and upon the matter administer Laws to the most Kings thereof, and if not prevented, 'tis very like they will joyn with the Turk, with whom they will have a peace, and do continually furnish them with all things needfull for their Warlike Ships, to the great anoy∣ance of many Christian Kings, and combining with them, they have ships enough to transport fifty, or sixty thousand Souldiers into any Christian Kingdom, all which may be prevented, God giving a blessing, and must be prevented, otherwise it is like to grow to the height of Wars, for rather then they will lose the benefit of fishing of Herring, Cod, and Ling, within our Seas, and leave to feed on the fat of this Commonwealth, they will joyn with Turk, Pa∣gan, or Jew, against any Christian King. Thus much con∣cerning the Western Seas, which being observed, will gather wealth enough to maintain Wars and Ships to increase our strength to the great wekening of the Hollan∣ders, and will beat them from all their Trade in the East-Indies, Ginny, Binny, and the Streight of Isbralter, Burdeux,
and Rochel, and New-found Land, for there cannot any ship pass East or West, but must pass through our Seas, where they can∣not well escape our Navy; on the contrary, if the Hollanders should continue Wars, they might set cut sundry Fleets, and at∣tempt to surprize our East-Indy Fleet at New-found-Land, Gi∣braelter, Burdeux, and Rochel, and other Eastern Ports, where they have trade, and so possess one or two hundred Sail of our ships, and may further, if they can gain the favour of the French King, have the succours of these Harbours, Murlays the Deep, Charleboys, and Marcellys, to the great anoyance of this Na∣tion, notwithstanding it will not profit them any thing, for that they must return with such purchase, as they shall take through our Seas, where they may be again surprized by our Navy; not∣withstanding all which, I conclude as before, that the favour, or disfavour of this Nation, doth so greatly concern them; as by the favour of this Nation, they may rise, or by their disfavour o∣verthrow them, and beating them by Sea, they cannot subsist by Land. Note. If the Hollander refuse to agree to such a well grounded peace as may be for the good of this Commonwealth, upon the conditions formerly exprest, and yet nevertheless will continue fishing in our Seas, then will it be time for the worthy Patriots of our Laws, Religion, and Safety to prune the branches of the sub∣tle Ivy climbing Peace, not suffering them to gather the fruits of our gardens, I meane our fishing Trade, for by it they encrease thier strength at sea, as that joyning with the Turk, which is greatly to be feared, they may anoy any King in Christendom; for although we may easily beat them from their Trade through the Western seas by reason of the advantage of our Harbors, yet they joyning by sea with the Turk will give bloody battel to any Christian King: Moreover, if they should be Masters of the Seas, then these in∣conveniencies may follow; first, in the Eastern seas they may molest our Merchant in their Trade to Newcastle, Hambugh, Stoad, and Denmark, Rushia, Sweadland, and Greenland, which will be a great impoverishing our Nation, which (God giving a blessing) may be prevented to the great benefit of this Common∣wealth: Note. As thus; After their distracted Navy, before menti∣oned,
is thus subdued, then we commanding, that 24 Sail of Warlike ships be appointed to keep the Western Seas, whereof the one half may remain in one of our Harbors to be victual'd, trim'd and rig'd, the orher 12 Sail to ply off and on athwart St Georges Channel, a convenient distance the one from the other, and there can no ships pass East or West but may be surprisd by them; so that in one quarter of a year they may take so many ships laden with goods and Merchandize, as shall defray the charge of this Commonwealth for a whole year; and if the Hollander set forth a stronger Fleet, then may these 12 Sail take succour in one of our Harbors: And I hold it no great dishonor in this case to retreat into a Harbor for safety, and to gain advantage, then a General in the field to gain advantage of the ground,Note. Wind, and Sun, before he give battel unto his Enemy. Thus much for the Western Seas. Now touching the Eastern Seas, the remainder of these eight∣score Sail, be they more or less, being Employed in these Eastern Seas in such or the like manner, according to further advice, will preserve our Adventures through these Seas, and soon bring the Hollanders to obedience. Many wanting experience may con∣ceive, that insisting hereon, I take more upon me then doth wel beseem me; Notwithstanding in as much as I doe certainly know that it greatly concerneth this Commonwealth and people of this Nation, from the greatest to the least, if every one did truly un∣derstand, they would with heart, and hand, and strength of purse, give furtherance unto this service; Notwithstanding all which, if the Hollander will deliver unto this Commonwealth Flushing, the Brill, and the Ramekins, as before mentioned, for an assurance of their fidelity, then is my labor at an end, we safe against all for∣reign enemies: But furthermore, it is my earnest desire, that i in expressing my knowledg unto my Country (for my Countrys good) concerning this service, hath caused me to exceed the bounds of measure, by insisting on a subject of so high a nature; yet he craves pardon, and hope a good construction will be made of what he hath done, and humbly prayes the acceptation of the will for the deed, as our blessed Saviour did the widdows Mite. Having ended this Discourse, I call to mind how the Hol∣landers
were Petitioners unto the late King, to grant them a term of years in His Seas, for the fishing of Herring, Cod, and Ling, and doubting it might be forgot that a former Book was presented unto the late King concerning the said fishing, I have thought good in all humility to revive unto this Nations memory the fishing of the said Herring, Cod, and Ling in our Seas, is well worth 4000000 l. yearly unto the Hollanders; Moreover, they imploy in the said fishing thirty thousand persons, which alway supply the Warlike Ships with Mairiners, besides Carpenters, Coopers, Splitters, Bulkers, Dryers, and Packers, Sickers, and Smoak∣ers of Herring-Net, and Cordmakers, so that there cannot be less then an hundred thousand men with their wives and chil∣dren maintained by their Craft. Now, if you take this fishing from them, then do they not onely lose their profit thereof, but also this hundred thousand persons will lose the imployment, and be a heavy charge upon Hollanders, nay if we keep the Hollandes but only from salt, as we may if we please, they are not able to save Herring, Cod, and Ling, or any other kind of fish, doe therefore most humbly desire the business be taken into Consideration by the Parliament; and not to grant them an estate of 21 years unless they give unto this Com∣monwealth, 40 hundred thousand pounds, and also deliver into the hands of this Commonwealth, Flushing, the Brill, and the Ramakins, this they must and will do, though greatly against their will to lose so great a benefit, for there is not any King in Chri∣stendom hath so great a treasure as our Seas, if true use were made of them. These things being observed, and the knowledg there∣of concealed from the Hollander, will without doubt, force them to yield obedience with litle expence or hazard of our Navy. Again, I confess my self unworthy to write these lines, yet in as much as my desire is to discover sundry great dangers which may en∣sue by the Hollander to this Commonwealth and Nation, and he means by Gods assistnce to prevent the sme, I ld my selfe bound in duty to my Coūtry to discover what I know by my own observations, that the profit and benefit of the fishing for Her∣ring, Cod, and Ling, was worth yearly to the Hollanders four Millions, since I was credibly informed by one Mr An∣thony Dyet,Note. a Gentleman of the Inns of Court,
who was told by a brother of his, dwelling in Amsterdam, that the said fishing was worth to the Hollanders yearly six milli∣ons, and also made known unto his brother, that the Hollanders sold so much to this Nation of that kind of fish,Note. as was worth sixteen hundred thousand pound yearly, which is a lamentable thing that they should impoverish this Ntion of that which truly by right belongs unto us, also one Isaack Oder Esquire, who in the Low Countries saw the Accounts of the said fishing, did credibly inform that the same was well worth to the Hollanders six millions yearly; this great Treasure of fishing hath made the Hollanders rich, and enabled their strength by Sea, and Land, to maintain Wars a∣gainst the Spaniard; and albeit they be thus enabled by the richness of these our Seas, and that all their victuals for fifty yeare space have been obtained by the firce Commanders, and expert Souldiers of our Nation, yet are they grown so un∣grateful that sundry wayes they have carried themselves un∣worthily towards this Commonwealth, which is generally known, that I need not express with my pen. Nay, they are so insolent grown, that at their Jovial meetings they have said,Note. as I am credibly informed, that England will never be well governed, till they have the govern∣ing of it: Now, may it please the worthy Senatours of this Commonwealth touching the inconveniencies, if we shall suf∣fer the Hollanders to be obsolute Commanders of the Seas, and not resist them, then these inconveniences following may ensue. First, They may keep the Newcastle coals from this City of London, which is the Cities principal fewel. They may keep from this Commonwealth Cables, Cordage, Tar, Pitch, Masts, Yards, Deal, and many other necessary Commodities, without which, within few years we shall not be able to set forth a ship to Sea, or a Boat to take any kinds of fish, nor be able to give an assistance unto Ireland, if there should be cause by invasion, or otherwise; nor yet the Island of Scilly, though it be but a very small Isle, yet it is of great importance, first for the preserving our ships in di∣stress of weather.
Secondly, Four warlike ships being harboured in that Island, may set sail upon all occasions, and greatly hinder the trade of an enemy, which shall have occasion to pass through those seas, and on the contrary, if an enemy (as God forbid) should surprize it, it would as greatly hinder us, in respect wher∣of 'ts needfull that that Island were victualed for one year, and the souldiers which lie there in Garison may spend some time in labour in fortifying of it where there is cause, so may it be made invincible, if this be not prevented: Besides these inconveniences formerly expressed, these discommodities may also ensue. Note. The trade of cloathing will greatly decay, the trans∣portation of fish-trade, and Tin will decay, and many thou∣sand will want imployment for want of trading: now for preventing all which inconveniences, if the Hollanders will deliver into our hands the Brill, Flushing, and the Ramekins, which they must (and with Gods assistance they shall do) if this be propagated, and set forward, then have we full assu∣rance of their fidelity, and thereupon, and for such considera∣tions, as to the Parliament shall seem good, to license them to enjoy half the fishing of our Seas, fishing man for man, and Tun for Tun, otherwise they will assuredly weather us, both in the taking the fish, and in the venting of it both at home, and abroad; this being effectually proceeded, it will maintain thousands of this Nation, encrease Mariners for Navigation, and greatly strengthen the Navy of this Common∣wealth, and enrich the Nation, advance the Customs, and raise a great and yearly Revenue unto this Commonwealth; and upon the matter, this being effected, we shall be most absolute and powerfull at Sea, and so consequently by Land. Now insomuch that the Hollanders swelling ambition hath caused them to refuse this great good graciously to be tendred to them, they are no further to be trusted, but a rougher course may be taken against them. Moreover, if those that sit at the Helm of the State please; a course may be taken without any great expense, that three∣score sail of Warlike shipping, twenty sail thereof of five
hundred Tun a piece of these twenty Sail, may be imployed in the Western Seas, four sail at the Isl of Scilly, and the o∣ther 32 n the Nrtheastern Seas, where here s n sl d called Shotland, so tht we having that Islnd, and the Hab  Ports of Scotland to command, sixteen of the two and ty Sail may ply off and on to the Bar, the Hollander of this trade and trffique in the Northeastern Ports, whilest he other sixeen Sail may be victualing, triming, and rigging in the Harbours, wih a command that they do not fight within the Hollander without great advantage, but return into some Harbour, and return again, if occasion shall require; the like cou se and directions shall be given to the Captains and Com∣manders of the Navy in the Western Seas. This being obser∣ved, we shll take as much wealth in three months as will maintain Wars two years, and under correction I should think it agreeable with reason that we should take their ship∣ping, and goods, as well as they do take our fishing of Her∣ring, Cod, and Ling, which is, and ever hath been the right of this Commonwealth, and Nations of England and Scotland, and anciently called Mare Brittanicum, yet the Hollander now cunningly gives it the Title of Mare Liberum. Now I could wish, and do humbly desire, that as King Pharaoh up∣on the Interpretation of his Dream by Joseph, provided in the seven years of plenty, for the seven years of famine, so if Parliament, and Councel of State would now in this time of plenty cause provision to be made for seven or five years at least, to prevent future want, and scarcity before mentioned, (to wit) Coals, Cables, Cordage, Pitch, and Tar, Masts, Yards, and Deal, and so this Course before recited, being observed will bring the Hollanders to a well grounded peace, though never so unwilling, for it is not possible for them to subsist five years without trading, and traffick, neither are they able to maintain Wars in the Low-Countryes, if they have not peace with this Commonwealth, unless they joyn with some other Nation against us, as it seemeth they now intend to do, but yet notwithstanding all their practises and devises, I hope we shall give them such a meeting as to make them vale Bonnet, and acknowledg us to be their Preservers.
Note. And furthermore it is to be observed, that the Hollanders constrained the King of Spain to spend in the Low-Countries and in wafting home his West-Indy Fleets, wtih other spoils and op∣pressions laid upon the Spaniard, four millons of pounds yearly at the least, and will in few years, if not prevented, work the Spani∣ard out of both the Jndies: For remedy whereof, if this Com∣monwealth could aid the King of Spain, and he upon such consi∣deration should furnish this Cōmonwealth yearly with two milli∣ons of pounds towards the strengthening of the Navy of this Com∣monwealth, and the furtherance of this service, he will not only save the other two millons which now he expendeth, but also preserve his East and West-Indy Fleets from the spoil of the Hol∣landers, and beat them from their Plantations in the East-Indies; for under favour I will boldly speak and maintain, that no three Kings in Christendom is able to do that help and good with is service touching the Hollanders unto the King of Spain as this Commonwealth, neither is it possible for the King of Spain to vanquish the Hollanders if we protect them: And thus having a firm League with the King of Spain, we may be continually furnisht with Cables, Cordage, Tarr, Pitch, Masts, Yeards, and Deals, Beef and Grain out of Denmark, and shall be enabled to beat the Hollander into their Ports, and so will they wast and consume as snow against the sun, and so upon the Conquest of the Hollan∣ders we may reserve still under the Command of this Common∣wealth Flushing, and the Brill, and the Ramekins, which will be a just occasion to continue peace between this Commonwealth and the King of Spain for ever, because we being possesed of those strong Towns, litle advantage can be made against this Common∣wealth. If those who are Trustees of this Commonwealth be pleased that this service be proceeded in, then it is very requisite, that it may be don with that secresie, that the Hollander may have no Inteligence thereof before the same be perfected, and that these Warlike Ships be built in several Ports, some in one Port, and some in another, within the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the New Plantations, where there is Timber enough and so built, they may be Placed in divers Harbors to be ready at all occasions; but so, that too many of our Ships be not together
in a small Harbour; for in 88. we escaped a great mischief, which had like to befallen, to the destruction of the Royal Navy of England, worthy to be noted, and right worthy to be avoided; which was thus, When the Spaniard intended to invade England with a great Navy, he made a stay at the Lands end, near the Island of Scilly, and there took sundry fisher Boats, and by them had intelligence that the Navy of England were in the Har∣bours of Plymouth, whereupon their Admiral hung out a Flag of Councel to consider whether it were better to destroy the said Fleet in the Harbours, or to come to an Anchor at Callice, as by their Commission they were commanded, and whilest they were thus in Counsel, one Captain Fleming dis∣covering the Spanish Fleet, with all his Sails; bearing, made speed unto Plymouth, and acquainted the then Lord Admi∣ral, and Sir Francis Drake, how near the Spanish Fleet were, who then presently beating up their Drums, commanded e∣very man upon pain of death to repair to their Ships, which being performed, and the wind contrary, so that they could not sail out of the Harbour by any means, they were constrain∣ed to tow and warp out the said Navy against the wind, by whose careful labours and endeavours, all the Navy was clear of the Harbour, sve only the Mary Rose commanded by Richard Hawkins, and the Hopewell, commanded by Sir Robert Cross, and by that time the Spanish Fleet was within sight of the Harbours, whereas with two old ships on fire, they might have fired the whole Navy in the Harbour, there∣fore it ought to be well considered of, for able and well ex∣perienced Seamen knoweth well how dangerous a thing it is to harbour too many ships in a small Hrbour, or any of the Western Harbours, or Ports, excepting only Faymouth, where there may well ride three hundred Sail without any such great danger, a Harbour most proper to succour our Na∣vy to anoy the enemy. Most worthy Patriots, too too long hath the Hollanders enriched themselves by feeding on the fat of this Common∣wealth,
and filled their Chests and Coffers with the treasure of our Golden Seas; the longer they be suffered, the stronger and richer they are, but by Gods holy assistance, and the Parliaments providence, they may easily be subdued, and brought to obedience. FINIS.
